Mission AruJIysis and Design, known as SMAD to its many friends, has \ngamed WIdespread use as a text and reference throughout the astronautics community. \nThe pwpose of the third edition of SMAD is to both update the book and make it more \nuseful and more practical wherever possible. Some topics, such as astrodynamics and \nmission geometry, have changed relatively little since pUblication of the second edi-\ntion in 1992. Here we have made minor modifications to make the material clearer and \nmore pr~. On the other hand, topics such as space computers and the design of \n?bserva~o~ p~yloads ,~ave been nearly co~letely rewritten. Because of the growing \nInterest In 'LightSats and low-Earth OrbIt constellations we have added a Small,sat \ncost model, expanded the discussion of constellation design, and included a new sec-\ntion on multi-satellite manufacturing. The entire volume reflects a greater emphasis on \nreducing mission cos~ ~d doing more with less people and fewer resources.\" Fmally, \nthe FIreSat sample mISSIon has been extended further and the appendices and end mat-\nter updated and expanded to provide greater utility as a quick reference. We hope the \nnew edition is better and more useful to you. \n\nAs with the first two editions, the goal of the book to is allow you to begin with a \n\"blank sheet of paper\" and design a space mission to meet a set of broad, often poorly \ndefined, objectives at minimum cost and risk. You should be able to define the mission \nin sufficient detail to identify principal drivers and make a preliminary assessment of \noverall performance, size, cost, and risk. The emphasis is on low-Earth orbit, un-\nmanned sp~ However, we .hope the principles are broad enough to be applica-\nble to ~ther mI~IOnS as well. We Intend the book to be a practical guide, rather than a \ntheoretical treatise. As much as possible, we have provided physical and engineering \ndata, rules of thumb, empirical formulas, and design algorithms based on past experi-\nence. We assume that the reader has a general knowledge of physics, math, and basic \nengineering, but is not necessarily familiar with any aspect of space technology. \n\nThe ~ edition represents an amalgam of contributions over the last decade by \nm~y engIneers. and m~agers ~m throughout the community. It reflects the insight \ngamed from theIr practical expenence, and suggests how things might be done better \nin the future. From time to time the views of authors and editors conflict, as must nec-\nessarily ~~ gi~en the broad diversity of experience. We believe it is important to \nreflect this diversIty rather than suppress the opinions of individual experts. Similarly, \nthe level of treatment varies among topics, depending both on the issues each author \nfeels is critical and our overall assessment of the level of detail in each topic that is \nimportant to the preliminary mission analysis and design process. \n\n\u2022 The continuing. unrelenting demand to drive down mission cost has led to the creation a \ncompanion volume to SMAD, RedUCing Space Mission Cost [Wertz and Larson, 1996] which \naddresses cost reduction in all aspects of mission design and includes 10 case studies ~f how \nthe process works in practice. \n\nxvi \n\n1 \nI Preface xvii \n\nThe book is intended as a textbook for either introductory graduate or advanced \nundergraduate courses, or as a reference for those already working in space tech-\nnology. It can also provide valuable supplementary material for related courses such \nas spacecraft design or space mission operations. We believe the book can be a key \ntool for payload designers who need to find out more about space mission design and \nfor those charged with the responsibility of developing space mission requirements \nand specifications. Fmally, we hope that it will be of use to many system engineers in \nthis field who have a detailed knowledge of one area, but need to broaden their .,ack-\nground or verify their understanding in related topics. \n\nThe book is meant to be read sequentially, although most of the chapters are self-\ncontained, with references to other parts of the book as needed. For readers with \nspecific interests, we recommend the following: \n\n\u2022 Those concerned primarily with mission analysis and design should read \nChaps. 1-9 and 19-23. \n\n\u2022 Those concerned with spacecraft and subsystem design should read Chaps. 1, \n2, 4,8-13, and 16-23. \n\n\u2022 Those concerned primarily with mission operations and the ground interaction \nshould read Chaps. 1,2,4, and 13-16. \n\n\u2022 Those concerned with requirements definition, logistics, and putting a space \nsystem in place should read Chaps. 1-4,7,9, 10, and 18-23. \n\n\u2022 Those interested in constellation design and multi-satellite systems should \nread Chaps. 1-9, 13-16, and 19-23. \n\n\u2022 Those interested in reducing mission cost and the design of low-cost missions \nshould read Chaps. 1-3,7-10,12,20-23, and the companion volume, Reduc-\ning Space Mission Cost. \n\nSI (metric) units are used throughout the book. Conversions for essentially all \ncommon units are contained in Appendix F. Conversion factors and physical constants \nare generally given to their full available accuracy so that they can be inserted into \ncomputer programs and not considered further. As discussed in the introduction to the \nappendices, the values given are those adopted by the National Bureau of Standards \nbased on a least-squares fit to the fundamental physical constants or international \nagreement on the defInitions of various units. In the case of astronomical constants, \nvalues adopted by the International Astronomical Union are given. The most com-\nmonly used astronautical formulas and constants are in the appendices. An expanded \ntable of space mission parameters for Earth orbits is on the inside back endleaf. For \nthose wishing to expand that table or use it for other central bodies, the formulas used \nfor creating it are on the preceding pages. \n\nLeadership, funding, and support essential to updating the book were provided by \nnumerous programs at the Air Force Space and Missile Center, Air Force Space \nCommand, NASA Headquarters, NASNGoddard Space Flight Center, and the \nAdvanced Projects Research Agency. Obtaining funding to create and maintain \nmuch-needed reference material is exceptionally difficult. We are deeply indebted to \nthe sponsoring organizations, particularly Air Force Phillips Laboratory, for their \nsupport and their recognition of the importance of projects such as this one. \n\nThe third edition of this book is the result of nearly two years of effort by a \ndedicated team of government, industry, and academic professionals. The Department \nof Astronautics, United States Air Force Academy, provided unwavering support for \n\n\n\nPreface \n\nthe project. Michael DeLorenzo, Chairman of the Department of Astronautics, \nprovided the leadership and continuing support critical to projects of this type. Both \nDoug Kirkpatrick and Perry Luckett performed a detailed grammatical review in a \nvaliant effort to prevent the rest of us from demonstrating why we became engineers \nrather than writers. Several graphics artists at the Academy, particularly Mary \nTostanoski and Debra Porter, spent many hours developing and updating artwork. \nJoan Aug and Bert Reinertson cheerfully handled the huge administrative burden at \nthe Academy. Numerous faculty members, staff, and students graciously sacrificed \ntheir time to provide assistance, review, and comments. Daryl Boden assisted with the \nediting and reviewing even after changing assignments to the Naval Academy. Doug \nKirkpatrick managed the task for the Air Force with great skill and patience and \nreviewed nearly all of the material for both technical and linguistic correctness! \n\nOAO Corporation, Colorado Springs, Colorado, provided the contract support for \nthe project. Anita Shute at the Air Force Academy spent many hours revising drafts, \ncreating artwork, and working all aspects of the project. Eugene deGeus Of Kluwer \nAcademic Publishers supplied substantial assistance with all aspects of the publishing \nactivity. This was his final project at Kluwer before taking a science administration \nposition with the Dutch government. We will miss his wisdom and guidance and wish \nhim the best of future success. \n\nAt Microcosm, the entire analysis and publications staff worked virtually all \naspects of the book (art, grammar, equation checking, technical reviews, and camera-\nready copy) and suffered patiently through ''the book project\" as it continually \nabsorbed great amounts of limited resources. Much of the new graphics was done by \nundergraduate students Karen Burnham. Paul Murata, Alan Chen, and Julie Wertz \nunder the very capable guidance of Kevin Polk and Simon Dawson. Jennifer Burnham \nand Judith Neiger did much of the proofing. Robert Bell did most of the demanding \ntask of updating units and conversion factors. John Collins created the new FueSat \ncost model. Wendi Huntzicker and Joy Sakaguchi created the new camera-ready copy \nfor most of the book. Joy and Chris deFelippo did much of the new art. Fmally, Donna \nKlungle did a truly remarkable job managing, administering, editing, reviewing, and \npreparing revisions, drafts, and the final camera-ready copy. Donna accomplished this \nwith skill and good humor, while dealing with the conflicting demands of multiple au-\nthors and editors. \n\nArthur Cox of Lawrence Livermore National Labs and the editors of Astrophysical \nQuantities [1999] graciously permitted the use of drafts of their forthcoming volume \nso that we could obtain the most current values for physical quantities. We highly \nrecommend that readers consult Astrophysical Quantities for solar system and astro-\nnomical parameters which are not contained here. . \n\nEvery effort has been made to eliminate mathematical and factua1 errors. Many \nerrors from prior editions have been found largely through readers' comments and \nconstructive criticism. Please continue to send any errors, omissions, corrections, or \ncomments to either editor at the addresses below. We sincerely hope that the book will \nbe of use to you in our common goal of reducing the cost and complexity of space \nutilization. \n\nFmally, one of the most exciting aspects of space mission analysis and design is that \nafter 40 years of space exploration we have only begun to scratch the surface of the \nvariety of important inissions that can and should be done. In spite of problems, set-\nbacks, and higher costs than any of us would like, people young and old remain excited \nabout space. The exploration of space will take dramatic new turns in the future, from \n\nPreface \n\ncommunications constellations and microgravity work now beginning to become a \nreality to solar power satellites, space tourism, space ind~t:rililization, and settlements \non the Moon and planets which are .still to be designed. We hope that this volume \nprovides a portion of the roadmap and incentive to those who will undertake these\u00b7 \ntasks. We wish you the best of success in this endeavor. \n\nJune, 1999 \n\nJamesR.

Broad objectives and constraints are the key to this process. \nProcurement plans for space systems too often substitute detailed numerical require-\nments for broad mission objectives. To get the most performance for the money spent. \nwe must require of the system only what it can reasonably achieve. Thus, while our \noverall objectives to communicate, navigate, or observe will generally remain the \nsame, we will achieve these objectives .differently as technology and our understand-\ning of the process and problem evolve. This chapter summarizes, and the book as a \nwhole details, this process of defining and refining both what is to be done and what \nmission concept will do it at the lowest cost. \n\nThere are now a number of references available on the mission design process and \nthe definition of mission objectives. Rechtin [1991] and Ruskin and Estes [1995] \nprovide general discussions \"fthis process. Shishko [1995] provides an overview from \nthe NASA perspective and Przemieniecki [1993] gives a similar treatment for defense \nmissions. Davidoff [1998] and Wertz and Larson [1996] discuss this process from the \nperspective of very low-cost missions and methods for dramatically reducing mission \ncost. respectively. Boden and Larson [1996] discuss the analysis and design process \nspecifically . for mission operations. Fmally, Kay [1995] examines the fundamental \ndifficulty of doing technical trades within a democratic political environment. \n\n1.1 bitroduction and Overview \n\nTable 1-1 summarizes our approach to the space mission analysis and design \nprocess. Space missions range widely from communications, to planetary explomtion, \nto proposals for space manufacturing, to burial in space. No single process can fully \ncover all contingencies, but the method in Table 1-1 summarizes a pmctical approach \nevolved over the first 40 years of space exploration. \n\n\n\n2 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 1.1 \n\nSpace is expensive. Cost is a fundamental limitation to nearly all space missions \nand is becoming more so. Consequently, this and subsequent tables reflect the assess-\nment of each author on how things traditionally have been done and how they should \nbe done differently, both to lower cost and to achieve the greatest retWll from the space \ninvesbnent \n\nAnalysis and design are iterative, gradWUIy refining both the requirements and \nmethods of achieving them. Thus, we must repeat the broad process defined in \nTable 1-1 many times for each mission. The first several iterations may take only a \nday, but more detailed assessments will take far longer. \n\nSuccessive iterations through Table 1-1 will usually lead to a more detailed, better-\ndefined space mission concept But we must still retWll regularly to the broad mission \nobjectives and search for ways to achieve them at a lower cost In defining and refining \nthe approach, there is strong pressure to proceed to ever greater detail, and never revise \na decision once it has been made. Although we must maintain orderly progress, we \nmust also review the mission design regularly for better ways to achieve the mission \nobjectives. Methods may change as a result of evolving technology, a new understand-\ning of the problem, or simply fresh ideas and approaches as more individuals become \ninvolved. \n\nTABLE 1-1.

If we wish to go \nback and reexamine decisions as new data becomes available, we must clearly under-\nstand and convey to others the reasons for each decision. We need this documentation \nfor decisions based on detailed technical analyses, and, equally important, for those \nbased on simplicity, ease of assessment, or political considerations. \n\nThis book presents many examples from real space missions. To illustrate the \nmission analysis and design process without being tied to existing space systems, we \ninvented the hypothetical FireSat space mission. Figure 1-1 shows the broad mission \nstatement we used to begin the process of space mission design for FrreSat We wish \n\n1.1 Introduction and Overview 3 \n\nto stress that the parameters developed throughout the book are by no means the only \npossible set for FrreSat, nor necessarily the best. To show how solutions may vary, \nChap. 22 presents a very low-cost spacecraft as an alternative for FrreSat. Our example \nsystem simply illustrates the iterative process of space mission analysis and design'. \nDifferent assumptions, requirements, or proposed solutions may lead to dramatically \ndifferent results. \n\nF1reSat \nMission Statement \n\nBecause forest fires have an IncreaSing Impact on recreation and \ncommerce and ever higher public visibility, the United States needs a \nmore effective system to Identify and monitor them. In addition, It would \nbe desirable (but not required) to monitor forest fires for other nations; \ncollect statistical data on fire outbreaks, spread, speed, and duration; and \nprovide other forest management data. \n\nUltimately, the Forest Service's fire-monitoring office and rangers In the \nfield will use the data. Data flow and formats must meet the needs of both \ngroups without specialized training and must allow them to respond \npromptly to changing conditions. \n\nFIg. 1-1. OrIgin of the Hypothetical FlreSat Mission. F1reSat Is used as the primary example \nthroughout this book. . \n\nTo illustrate the broad process of Table 1-1, we will go through each of the top-\nlevel steps for the FrreSat mission and indicate the type of information that needs to be \ndeveloped: \n\nIn Step 1, we define what the mission needs to achieve. What are our quaIitative \ngoals, and why? This information should come largely from the mission statement of \nFig. 1-1. We need to retWll to this broad goal over and over to ask whether we are \ndoing what we set out to do. \n\nStep 2 is significantly different It quantifies how well we wish to achieve the \nbroad objectives, given our needs, applicable technology, and cost constraints. These \nquantitative requirements should be subject to trade as we go along. A major error in \nmany space-system procurements is to set requirements in concrete at a relatively \nearly stage. An example for FrreSat might be a 100 m positioning accuracy for initial \nfire detection. A 100 m requirement seems to be a reasonable place to start, but \ncompared to an accuracy of 200 m, it could add tens or even hundreds of millions of \ndollars to the overall system cost. We might spend this extra money better in acquiring \nfire detection airplanes, providing more personnel on the ground, or using better fire-\nfighting technology. Congress, the Deparbnent of the Interior, and the Forest Service \nmust ultimately decide how well FrreSat should do and at what cost. Space mission \nanalysis and design provides the quantitative data needed to support such decisions. \n\nOur next step is to define and characterize a space mission to meet the objectives. \nStep 3 begins this process by developing alternative mission concepts. A mission \nconcept or concept of operations is a broad statement of how the mission will work in \npractice. It includes issues such as how the data will be sensed and delivered to the end \nuser, how the mission will be controlled, and the overall mission timeline. Alternative \nmission concepts include, for example, conceptually distinct approaches to the prob-\nlem such as the very low-cost approach defined in Chap. 22. These would also include \n\n\n\n4 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 1.1 \n\ndifferent orbits or different wavelength bands for fire detection that would require \ndramatically dissimilar systems. \n\nStep 4 defines alternate combinations of mission elements or the space mission \narchitecture to. meet the requirements of the mission concept. The space mission \narchitecture is the mission concept plus a definition of each of the elements of the \nmission shown in Fig. 1-3 (Sec. 1.2). A good way to begin Step 4 is to look at the \nmission elements in Fig. 1-3 and consider what alternatives for each of them would \nbest meet mission objectives. \n\nIn any real system, many things influence overall cost, performance, or the design \nof detailed components. However, these are influenced mainly by a relatively small \nnumber of key parameters or components, called drivers. Thus, there may be cost, \nperformance, or system drivers which affect the design of the overall space system. In \nStep 5 we identify the principal cost and performance drivers for each alternative \nmission concept. For most space missions, system drivers include the number of \nsatellites, altitude, power, and instrument size and weight. (Sec. 2.3 gives a more \ndetailed 1ist.) By explicitly identifying the system drivers, we can concentrate our \neffort on parameters having the most impact on the design and therefore on the cost of \nthe space mission. This method improves our chances of getting the best possible \ndesign within the available budget. \n\nStep 6 is typically the most involved in mission design because it defines in detail \nwhat the system is and does. Here we determine the power, weight, and pointing \nbudgets\" and decide what to process on the ground or in space. Characterizing the \nmission is the most costly step because it requires the expertise of many people. \nDeveloping detail is always comforting in managing any design process but, as noted \nearlier, we must take care not to overdo details while characterizing the mission. \nSystem-level requirements and trades must remain our primary focus. \n\nThe next step in mission analysis and design is to evaluate the systems we have \ndefined. Having defined and characterized alternative mission concepts, we return in \nStep 7 to our initial quantitative requirements and identify the critical requirements, t \nthat is, the key requirements principally responsible for determining the cost and \ncomplexity of the system. Recall that the system drivers are those defining parameters, \nsuch as altitude or payload aperture, which most strongly affect the cost, performance, \nand system design. System drivers are not normally system requirements. However, a \ncritical requirement for covemge or resolution may result in altitude and aperture \nbecoming performance or system drivers. The implication of this for mission analysis \nand design is that we must put substantial effort into understanding the quantitative \nrelationship between, for example, altitude, aperture, covemge, and resolution, in \norder to set intelligently both the requirements (covemge and resolution) and system \npammeters (altitude and aperture). For FtreSat, the critical requirements might be fire \nlocation accumcy, resolution, coverage, or timeliness of the data. We should concen-\ntrate on these requirements to determine how firm they are, how good we should make \nthem, and how much we will pay for them to achieve our broad objectives. Critical \nrequirements may differ for alternative mission concepts. \n\n\u2022 A budget is a numerical list of the components of any overall system parameter. Thus, the total \nspacecraft weight budget would consist of the weights assigned to the payload instruments, \nthe various subsystems, the propellant required, and typically some margin for growth. \n\nt In the first and second editions of this book, critical requirements were called driving require-\nments. We changed the terminology to avoid confusion with the system drivers of Step 5. \n\nIntroduction and Overview 5 \n\nThe above questions form the basis of mission utility analysis, Step 8, in which we \nquantify how well we are meeting both the requirements and the broad objectives as a \nfunction of either cost or key system-design choices. We would like to provide the \ndecision maker a single chart of potential performance vs. cost. More typically, we \nmust settle for something less ideal, such as the percent of fires detected within 2 hours \nvs. the aperture of the instrument, or the delay time in detecting forest fires vs. altitude \nand the number of satellites in the constellation. Only the user or developer of the sys-\ntem can ultimately determine the goodness of these critical performance measures, \ncalled Measures o/Effectiveness or Figures o/Merit. Consequently, mission definition \nmust be to some degree a joint process between those who understand the mission \nanalysis and design process and those who eventually must use the system or justify \nits cost. \n\nHaving evaluated alternative designs and done a preliminary assessment of mission \nutility, we select one or more baseline system designs in Step 9. A baseline design is \na single consistent definition of the system which meets most or all of the mission \nobjectives. A consistent system definition is a single set of values for all of the system \npammeters which fit with each other-e.g., resolution and covemge mtes which cor-\nrespond to the assigned altitude, aperture, and resulting spacecraft weight. In actually \ndesigning a space system, many parameters are being defmed and changed simulta-\nneously. The baseline provides a tempomry milestone against which to measure \nprogress. It also allows us to limit the number of options which must be evaluated. \nRather than looking at all possible combinations of altitude, aperture, power, and \nspectral band (a nearly impossible task), it is much more feasible to look at the impact \nof varying each of these individually relative to one or two baseline designs. As the \nsystem design matures, the baseline becomes more firm, and eventually becomes the \nsystem design. However, we should always remember that the baseline is only a start-\ning point for the itemtive trade process and should not be regarded as an ironclad \ndefinition of mission pammeters. \n\nBecause builders of a space system work from specific requirements, we must \ntranslate the broad objectives and constraints of the mission into well-defined system \nrequirements in Step 10. In Step 11, we flow down or allocate these numerical \nrequirements to the components of the overall space mission in the same way that a \nbudget allocates weight and power to the spacecraft's components. The final list of \ndetailed requirements reflects how well we have done the job of space mission \nanalysis, design, and allocation. \n\n1.1.1 Changes in Fnture Space Missions \nThe way we analyze and design space missions is itself continually evolving. In \n\nparticular, we expect major changes in this process because of increasing techno-\nlogical maturity, increasing use of onboard processing, and continuing emphasis on \nlow-cost missions. \n\nTechnological limits on space explomtion are giving way to those of policies, \npolitics, and economics. Nearly any mission is technically feasible. It is well within \nour technical capacity to build a lunar base, mount manned explomtions to Mars or \nother planets, create an industrial base in space, or build networks of satellites to \nprovide truly global communications and observations. Our activity in space depends \non what we can afford to do or what we choose to do. Therefore, we must carefully \nanalyze why we choose to use or explore space. We must select each space mission, \nnot just to achieve something that could not have been done before, but to achieve \nsomething that should be done or is worth doing. \n\n\n\n6 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 1.1 \n\nA major technological change in future space missions will be increased use of \nonboard computers. Space system developers have been very slow to use computers \nbecause of the conservative approach to spacecraft design, long lead times in space-\ncraft production, and very real difficulties associated with running a computer reliably \nin space.\u00b7 The shift to increased onboard processing is moving spacecraft toward more \nautonomy and increased complexity in terms of the tasks they undertake. Whether this \nchange drives space costs up or down depends upon the government and industry's \napproach to autonomy and software development for space. Spacecraft may follow the \nexample of ground systems, carrying either low-cost commercial systems or vastly \nmore expensive but more capable special purpose systems. \n\nWe anticipate continuing emphasis on low-cost spacecraft. Small spacecraft will \nincrease for future space missions. These could be either individual, single-pmpose, \nsmall satellites or large constellations of smaI1 satellites used for communications, \nspace-based radar, or tactical applications. Again, the community appears to be divid-\ning into those who can build smaI1, low-cost spacecraft and those who continue to \nbuild large, expensive systems. Creating LightSats represents a new ethic and a new \nway of doing business in space. If the space business is to grow and prosper as com-\nmercial aviation has, we must find a way to reduce the costs of using space. Lowering \ncost is the real challenge for space mission analysis and design, as well as the govem-\nment and industrial groups which have created and used this process. \n\nFmally, the mission' concept and associated space mission architecture largely \ndetermine the cost, complexity, and efficiency of the overall system, This is com-\npounded greatly when you begin to consider integrating the operational aspects of \nmany different missions. For example, today within DoD, we have communication, \nnavigation, signal intelligence, reconnaissance, and weather systems; each with their \nown mission concept and architecture. The upcoming challenge is to find ways for \nthese systems to operate together to meet user needs. \n\nThe fundamental question is ''Who are the customers, and what products or services \ndo they require?\" In trying to answer this we find ourselves dealing with information-\nrelated issues: What information is required, Where, and in what form? Most \ncustomers don't care about the existence of communications, navigation, or weather \nsatellites. They need specific information and are not interested in what systems \nprovide it Today's challenge is to blend the capabilities and information available \nfrom multiple systems to meet customer needs. Military people often express this as \ntasking, processing, interpretation, and dissemination, whereas commercial people \noften express the same issues as customer requests processing, formatting, and \ndelivery. \n\nFigure 1-3 is divided along somewhat arbitrary, functional boundaries. We need to, \nfind ways to dissolve theSe artificial boundaries and create cost-effective solutions to \nour customer's information needs. For example, instead of trying to integrate the \nseparate systems discussed above, we might consider having multimission payloads \nand spacecraft that have the ability to gather intelligence information, weather, and \nprovide navigation using one payload-multimission payloads. \n\nAn alternative to creating multimission payloads is to divide the architecture \ndifferently by placing all sensors on one space asset, processing capability on another \n\n\u2022 Space computers are far more susceptible than ground computers to single-evenl upsets caused \nby the bigh-radiation environment or randomly occurring cosmic rays. To protect against this \ndamage, we must design computers specifically for use in space, as described in Chap. 16. \n\n1.2 The Space Mission Life Cycle 7 \n\nand using existing or proposed communications links to move the information around. \nA third alternative might be to use a series of low-cost LightSats each doing a separate \nfunction, but in such a way that the end results can be easily and directly integrated by \nthe user's equipment on the grpund. \n\nThese examples provide a slightly different perspective which is difficult for many \norganizations, both industrial and government, to adopt because we think and organize \nfunctionally-launch, spacecraft, operations, and so on. Being able to functionally \ndecompose our missions and divide them into workable pieces has been one of the \nreasons, for our success. On the other hand, if we think only functionally it may cause \nsignificant problems. We must also think horizontally and create systems that can be \nintegrated with other space and ground systems to create capabilities that are greater \nthan the sum of their parts. As always, our goal is to meet the total user needs at \nminimum cost and risk. \n\n1.2 The Space Mission Life Cycle \n\nTable 1-2 illustrates the life cycle of a space mission, which typically progresses \nthrough four phases:, \n\n\u2022 Concept exploration, the initial study phase, which results in a broad definition \nof the space mission and its components. \n\n\u2022 Detailed development, the formal design phase, which reswts in a detailed \ndefinition of the system components and, in larger programs, development of \ntest hardware or software. \n\n\u2022 Production and deployment, the construction of the ground and flight hard-\nware and software and launch of the first full constellation of satellites. \n\n\u2022 Operations and support, the day-ta-day operation of the space system, its \nmaintenance and support, and finally its deorbit or recovery at the end of the \nmission life. \n\nThese phases may be divided and named differently depending on whether the \nsponso1'-the group which provides and controls the program budget-is DoD, \nNASA, one of the many international organizations, or a commercial enterprise. The \ntime required to progress from initial concept to deorbiting or death of the space asset \nappears to be independent of the sponsor. Large, complex space missions typically \nrequire 10 to 15 years to develop and operate from 5 to 15 years, whereas small, \nrelatively simple missions require as few as 12 to 18 months to develop and operate \nfor 6 months to several years. \n\nProcurement and operating policies and procedures vary with the sponsoring \norganization, but the key players are the same: the space mission operator, end user or \ncustomer, and developer. Commercial space missions are customer driven. The main \ndifference between users and customers is that customers usua1ly pay for a service, \nwhereas users receive services that others pay for. Operators control and maintain the \nspace and ground assets, and are typically applied engineering organizations. End \nusers receive and use the products and capability of the space mission. They include \nastronomers and physicists for science missions, meteorologists for weather missions. \nyou and me for communication and navigation missions, geologists and agronomists \nfor Earth resources missions, and the war fighter for offensive and defensive military \n\n\n\n8 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process \n\nTABLE 1-2.

The developer is the procuring agent, be it government or a commer-\ncial enterprise, and includes the contractors, subcontractors, and government develop-\nment, and test organizations. The operators and users must generate technically and \nfiscally responsible requirements; the developer must provide the necessary product \nor capability on time and .within changing political and funding constraints. \n\nThree basic activities occur during the Concept Exploration Phase (see Fig. 1-2). \nUsers and operators develop and coordinate a set of broad needs and performance \nobjectives based on an overall concept of operations. At the same time. developers \ngenerate alternative concepts to meet the perceived needs of the user and operating \ncommunity. In addition. the sponsor performs long-range planning. develops an \noverall program structure, and estimates budgetary needs and available funding to \nmeet the needs of the users. operators, and developers. In order to be successful in pr0-\nducing and deploying a new space capability. the four key players in this activity must \nclosely integrate their areas of responsibility. \n\nThis book emphasizes the concept exploration phase which further divides into \nneeds analysis and concept development, as detailed in Table 1-3. The goal during \nconcept exploration is to assess the need for a space mission and to develop affordable \nalternatives that meet operator and end-user requirements. The Needs Analysis is a \n\n1.2 The Space Mission Life Cycle \n\nConcept Exploration Detailed Development \n\nRg. 1-2. OrganlzaUons and People that Play Key Roles In Space Missions.

Operators and end users \ndevelop potential mission requirements based on the considerations shown in the left-\nhand column of Table 1-3. The process is different for each organization, but at some \npoint a new program begins with a set of mission objectives. concept of operations, \nand desired schedule. In DoD, the Mission Needs Statement documents this informa-\ntion and becomes part of the planning, programming, and budgeting system [Defense \nSystems Management College. 1990]. If approved, the program receives funding and \nproceeds to concept development . \n\nAt the Program Initiation milestone, the funding organization commits to pr0-\nceeding through concept development. The program will receive different levels of \nscrutiny depending on its scope, political interest, and funding requirements. In DoD. \nprograms classed as major programs receive the utmost attention at the highest levels \nof the Defense Department. Various components of the military use distinct criteria to \nidentify major programs [Defense Systems Management College. 1990]. A DoD crit-\nical requirements program is \"major\" if it requires more than $200 million in research. \ndevelopment, test, and evaluation funds or more than $1 billion in production costs. \nPrograms that require participation by more than one component of the anned forces \nor have congressional interest may also be classified as major programs. \n\nDuring Concept Development the developer must generate alternative methods of \nmeeting the operator's and end user's needs. This procedure includes developing and \nassessing different concepts and components for mission operations. as well as \n\n\n\n10 The Space Mission ADalysis and Design Process 1.2 \n\nTABLE 1-3. Further Breakdown of Concept exploration Phase. During concept exploration \nthe operator and end users define their needs and requirements and pass them to \nthe developing organization for concept development.

The information \nbecomes part of an overall system concept High-level managers in the user, operator, \nand development communities evaluate whether the concepts, initial mission objec-\ntives, and potential requirements meet the mission's intentions. If the program satisfies \nthe need at a reasonable cost, it passes the Requirements Validation milestone and \nproceeds into the Detailed Development Phase. \n\nThis book provides the technical processes and information necessary to explore \nconcepts for many space missions. Table 1-3 identifies a major concern that can \nundermine the entire process: in many cases, users and operators analyze the needs and \nformulate mission'requirements apart from the development community. Then they \npass these requirementS \"over the wall\" without negotiating. The developer often \ngenerates alternatives without the operators and users. These autonomous actions \nproduce minimum performance at maximum cost \n\nTo explore a concept successfoDy, we must remove the waDs \nbetween the sponsor, space operators, IlSers or customers, and \ndevelopers and become a team. \n\nA good team considers the mission's operations,objectives, and requirements as \nwell as the available technology to develop the best possible mission concept at the \nlowest possible Iife-cycIe cost \n\nAll space missions consist of a set of elements or components as shown in \nFig. 1-3. The arrangement of these elements form a space mission architecture. \nVarious organizations and programs define their mission elements differently, \nalthough all of the elements are norma1Iy present in any space mission. \n\nThe subject of the mission is the thing which interacts with or is sensed by the space \npayload: moisture content, atmospheric temperature, or pressure for weather missions; \ntypes of vegetation, water, or geological formations for Earth-sensing missions; or a \nrocket or intercontinental ballistic missile for space defense missions.

In many \nmissions, we may trade off the subject For example, if we are trying to track a \nmissile during powered flight, the subject could be the rocket body or exhaust plume, \nor both. \n\nFor communications and navigation missions the subject is a set of equipment \non the Earth or on another spacecraft, including communication terminals, televisions. \nreceiving equipment for GPS navigation, or other user-furnished equipment The key \nparameters of this equipment characterize the subject for these types of missions. \n\n'-' \nI \n\ni I \n~ill \n\n\n\n12 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 1.3 \n\nThe payload consists of the hardware and software that sense or interact with the \nsubject Typically, we trade off and combine severaISensOrs and experiments to form \nthe payload, which largely determines the mission's cost, complexity, and effective-\nness. The subsystems of the spacecraft bus support the payload by providing orbit and \nattitude maintenance, power, co~d, telemetry and data handling, structure and \nrigidity, and temperature control. The payload and spacecraft bus together are called \nthe spacecraft, space segment, or launch vehicle payload. \n\nThe launch system includes the launch facility, launch vehicle and any upper stage \nrequired to place the spacecraft in orbit, as well as interfaces, payload fairing, and \nassociated ground-support equipment and facilities. The selected launch system \nconstrains the size, shape, and mass of the spacecraft. \n\nThe orbit is the spacecraft's path or trajectory. Typically, there is a separate initial \nparking orbit, transfer orbit, and final mission orbit There may also be an end-of-life \nor disposal orbit The mission orbit significantly influences every element of the \nmission and provides many options for trades in mission architecture. \n\nThe communications architecture is the arrangement of components which satisfy \nthe mission's communication, command, and control requirements. It depends strong-\nlyon the amount and timing requirements of data to be transferred, as well as the num-\nber, location, availability, and communicating ability of the space and ground assets. \n\nThe ground system consists of fixed and mobile ground stations around the globe \nconnected by various data links. They allow us to command and track the spacecraft, \nreceive and process telemetry and mission data, and distribute the information to the \noperators and users. \n\nMission operations consist of the people, hardware, and software that execute the \nmission, the mission operations concept, and attendant policies, procedures, and data \nflows. Fmally, the command, control, and communications (C3) architecture contains \nthe spacecraft, communications architecture, ground segment, and mission operations \nelements. \n\n1.3 Step 1: Definition of Mission Objectives \n\nThe first step in analyzing and designing a space mission is to define mission \nobjectives: the broad goals which the system must achieve to be productive. Figure 1-4 \nshows sample objectives for FrreSat We draw these qualitative mission objectives \nlargely from the mission statement In contrast, the mission requirements and \nconstraints discussed in Sec. 1.4 are quantitative expressions of how well we achieve \nour objectives-balancing what we want against what the budget will allow. Thus, \nwhereas we may modify objectives slightly or not at all during concept exploration, \nwe often trade requirements throughout the process. For FrreSat to be FrreSat, it must \ndetect, identify, and monitor forest fires. As we trade and implement elements of the \nsystem during concept exploration, we must ensure that they meet this fundamental \nobjective. An excellent example of the careful definition of broad mission objectives \nfor space science missions is given by the National Research Council [1990]. \n\nOrdinarily, space missions have several objectives. Some are secondary objectives \nwhich can be met by the defined set of equipment, and some are additional objectives \nwhich may demand more equipment Nearly all space missions have a hidden agerula \nwhich consists of secondary, typically nontechnical, objectives. Frequently political, \nsocial, or cultural, they are equally real and equally important to satisfy. For example, \na secondary objective for FrreSat could be to show the public a visible response to \n\n1.3 Step 1: Definition of Mission Objectives 13 \n\n- RreSat \nMission Objectives \n\nPrimary ObJectJve: \nTo detect, Identify, and monitor forest fires throughout the UnltedStates, \nIncluding Alaska and HawaII, In near real time. \n\nSecondary ObJectives: \n\nTo demonstrate to the public that positive action Is underway to contain \nforest fires. \nTo collect statistical data on the outbreak and growth of forest fires. \nTo monitor forest fires for other countries. \nTo collect other forest management data. \n\nFig. 1-4. FlreSat Mission ObJectives. Unlike requirements, which specify numerical levels of \nperformance, the mission objectives are broad statements of what the system must do \nto be useful. \n\nfrequent forest fires. Third World nations produce satellites in part to show that their \ndeveloping technology makes them important players in international politics. Of \ncourse, this secondary political objective for space programs has been important for \nmany years in both the United States and the former Soviet Union. If we are to meet \nall of a space mission's objectives, we must identify secondary and nontechnical \nobjectives as well as primary ones. \n\nMultiple objectives also occur when we use a single satellite to meet different \ndemands. For example, we may use FIreSat's temperature-sensing instruments to \nmonitor global changes in ocean temperatures. In this case, the secondary objectives \ncould become as important as the primary ones. A second example would be adding a \ncommunications payload to FrreSat to permit better communications among the \ndistributed groups who fight forest fires. Although the primary objective usually will \nbe quite stable, secondary objectives may shift to meet the users' needs and the \nredefined potential of the space mission concept \n\nAs in the case of most of the top-level trades, we recommend strongly against \nnumerical formulas that try to \"score\" how well a mission meets its objectives. We can \ncompute probabilities for' achieving some technical objectives, but trying to \nnumerically combine the coverage characteristics of different FrreSat constellations \nwith the political impact of launching FrreSat is too simplistic for effective decision \nmaking. Instead, we must identify objectives separately so we can judge how to \nbalance alternative objectives and mission concepts. \n\nGood mission objectives incorporate user needs and, at least indirectIy, the space \ncharacteristics we are exploiting to achieve them. As stated earlier, space is expensive. \nIf our end objective does not use one of the fundamental space characteristics, it will \nlikely cost less to do on Earth. For example, there is little reason to manufacture low-\ncost consumer goods or publish books in space. \n\nWhat fundamental characteristics of space make space missions desirable? \nTable 1-4 lists some of them with their corresponding missions. Exploring and using \nspace serves various objectives, from extremely practical telecommunications and \nweather, to major scientific observatories hoping to understand the universe better, to \nadvanced military applications and exploring and exploiting the Moon and planets. \nOur objectives are diverse partIy because we use many different space characteristics. \n\n\n\n14 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 1.3 \n\nFor example, materials processing uses the microgravity and high vacuum of space, \ndisregarding the spacecraft's position over the Earth. Conversely, communications or \nobservation satellites emphasize Earth coverage as the most fundamental space \ncharacteristic to achieve their objectives. \n\nTABLE 1-4.

Many current missions use the global perspective of \nspace--for telecommunications, weather, navigation, and other aspects of Earth \nmonitoring. Space-based telecommunications will continue to grow, but it is already \na major and mature industry. Satellite communications by telephone and television \nhave become a part of everyday life and have helped to bring about a communications \nrevolution largely responsible for our sbrinking world. Equally dramatic changes are \nlikely in the future as new applications for space-based communications and naviga-\ntion continue to emerge. \n\nIn contrast to telecommunications, materials processing and precision manu-\nfacturing in gravity-free space is only in its infancy. Major strides appear possible in \npharmaceutical and semiconductor devices that may bring about an entirely new \nindustrial segment Exploiting space's almost limitless resources is even further \nremoved. Unlimited continuous power and huge, accessible supplies of physical \nmaterials may, in the long run, maintain an industrialized society without destroying \nthe Earth's fragile environment These objectives will\" require greater vision than \nthose for the more fully developed areas of communications, resource mapping, and \nmonitoring. \n\nWe see from Table 1-4 that we have either not used or only begun to use most of \nthe ouUor characteristics of space, so changes in future space exploration should be far \n\n1.4 Step 2: PreUminary Estimate of Mission Needs, Requirements, and Constraints 15 \n\nlarger than present development To take practical advantage of these characteristics, \nwe must greatly reduce the costs of exploring and exploiting space. Fmding ways to \nlower these costs is a principal objective of this book. (See Wertz and Larson [1996].) \n\n1.4 Step 2: Preliminary J\u00a3stjmate of Mission Needs, \nRequirements, and Constraints \n\nHaving defined the broad objectives that the space mission is to achieve, we wish \nto transfonn them into preliminary sets of numerical requirements and constraints on \nthe space mission's performance and operation. These requirements and constraints \nwill largely establish the operational concepts that will meet our objectives. Thus, we \nmust develop requirements which truly reflect the mission objectives and be willing to \ntrade them as we more clearly define the space system. \n\nTo transfonn mission objectives into requirements, we must look at three broad \nareas: \n\n\u2022 Functional Requirements, which define how well the system must perfonn to \nmeet its objectives. \n\n\u2022 Operational Requirements, which determine how the system operates and how \nusers interact with it to achieve its broad objectives. ' \n\n\u2022 Constraints, which limit cost, schedule, and implementation techniques \navailable to the system designer. \n\nThe needs, requirements, and constraints for any specific mission will depend upon \nthe mission itself and how we implement it. For example, the mission may be a \ncommercial venture, a government scientific program, or a crash emergency program \nresponding to dire need. Still, most space missions develop their requirements accord-\ning to the basic characteristics in Table 1-5. \n\nEstablishing top-level mission requirements is extremely difficult, depending on \nmission needs and on the perceived complexity or cost of meeting them. Therefore, \ncontrary to frequent practice, we should iterate the numerical requirements many times \nin the design process. The first estimate of mission requirements must come from the \ngoals and objectives combined with some view o.f wh~t is feasible. ~n, ~e. can \nreiterate or slightly modify requirements and specifications from preVIOUS JD1SSlOns. \nthus carrying over information known from those missions .. Of. course, we must be \nprepared to trade these requirements as we develop the lDlSS10n concept, thereby \navoiding the problem of keeping old and inappropriate requirements. \n\nThe next step in setting up preliminary mission requirements is to look for the \n\"hidden agenda\" discussed in Sec. 1.3 and Chap. 2. This agenda contains the devel~ \noper's implicit goals and constraints. For example, the FrreSat mission may need to be \nperceived as responding quickly to public demand. Thus, an extended R&D program \nto develop the most appropriate FrreSat satellite may not be acceptable. \n\nAs discussed further in Chap. 21, we must recognize that developing a space \nmission depends on political, legal, and economic elements, as well as technology. \nThus, the most appropriate solution must meet mission technic~ requirements and the \ndeveloper's political and economic goals. For example, satellIte systems for a small \nnation may use components built in that nation or develop some new components \nlocally, even though ihey would cost less.i~bought in '?therc~untries. In this~, we \nwould spend more money to meet a polItical constraInt: usmg the space lDlSSlon to \n\n\n\n------------------------------------~~---~--------\n\n16 The Space Mission AiJalysis and Design Process 1.4 \n\nTABLE 1-5.

The technical community often \nsets aside nontechnical considerations and regards them as less important or less real \nthan technical constraints. But a successful mission design must include all require-\nments and constraints placed on the system. \n\n1.4 Step 2: Preliminary Estimate of Mission Needs, Requirements, an~ Constraints 17 \n\nFinally, we reiterate that preliminary mission requirements should be established \nsubject to later trades. Mission designers often . simply lty to meet the procuring \ngroup's requirements and constraints, because not meeting them appears to be a strong \ncompetitive disadvantage. Consequently, designers may not modify them, even if \nchanges could make the system cost less or perform better for a given cost Section 3.3 \nand Chap. 4 detail this process of trading on system requirements to maximize per-\nformance vs. cost \n\nAs. an example, we consider the requirement for mission duration or spacecraft \nlifetime, which mayor may not be the same. This parameter exemplifies the difficulty \nof establishing requirements. The length of the mission is often indefinite. We want to \ndetect, identify, and monitor forest fIreS continuously at a reasonable cost per year. In \npractice, however, we must develop a system that meets this need and then deploy it \nwith an established design life and, perhaps, a replenishment philosophy. The design \nlife of the individual FtreSat spacecraft will strongly affect cost and will determine the \nlevel of redundancy, propellant budgets, and other key system parameters. In princi-\nple, we would like to obtain a graph of spacecraft cost vs. design life as shown in Fig. \n1-5. We could then easily compute the total expected cost per year for different design \nlives, as shown by the dashed line, and the minimum spacecraft cost per year. We \ncould also assess technological obsolescence, or the point at which we wish to replace \nthe spacecraft because of better or cheaper technology. \n\n\\ ; \n\\ +--- Cost per Year \" \n\\ \n\\ Total Cost ~ I \n\\ I \n\n\\ \" \\ , \\ , \n\\ , \n\\ ' \n\n\\ \" \n-----~.---------~ \" \" Best Spacecraft DesignS life \n\nSpacecraft \" .... \nCost ....... , ...... , -------\"\"----\n\nLaunch Cost \n\nSpacecraft Design life \n\nRg.1-5. HypotheUcai Curve of Cost vs. Spacecraft Design life. The cost per year Is the \ntotal cost dMded by the design life. In principle, we should use such curves to set the \nSpacecraft DesIgn life requirement In practice, they rarely exist. See Sec. 20.5 for a \nCost vs. DesIgn life curve for FireSat \n\nIn practice, figures such as 1-5 are almost never done or, at best, are done \nqualitatively. The mission duration is normally assigned rather arbitrarily with a \ngeneral perception of cost per year. ThUs, there may be a push to produce spacecraft \nlasting 5 or 10 years because people believe these will be more economical than ones \nlasting only a few years. No matter how we choose the design life, we would like to \ngo through the process described above for decisions about mission lifetime. If at all \n\n'11 \n\n\n\n18 The Space Mission Analysis and Design Process \n\npossible, it would be desirable. to create a chart similar to Fig. 1-5 based on even crude \nestimates of spacecraft cost Doing so provides a much stronger basis for, establish-\ning mission requirements and, e.g., determining whether we should push harder for a \nlonger spacecraft lifetime or back off on this requirement to reduce spacecraft \ncost \n\nHaving made a preliminary estimate of mission requirements and constraints, we \nproceed in Chap. 2 to define and characterize one or more baseline mission concepts. \nThe issue of refining requirements and assessing how well objectives can be met is \ndiscussed in Chaps. 3 and 4. \n\nReferences \n\nBoden, Daryl G. and WIley 1.

The goal is to select the best overall approach from the wide range available \nto execute a space mission. Typically we wish to choose the loweSt cost or the most \ncost-effective approach, and provide a traceable rationale that is intelligtble to decision \nmakers. \n\nThe initial process of mission characterization is discussed for general missions by \nGriffin and French [1991] and Pisacane and Moore [1994]. Elbert [1987, 1996] and \nAgrawal [1986] provide similar discussions for communications and geosynchrono1JS \nsatellites. Eckart [1996] and Woodcock [1986] discuss this process for manned mis-\nsions and Wall and Ledbetter [1991] do so for remote sensing. Boden and Larson \n[1996] discuss initial characterization for mission operations and London [1994] \nprovides a similar overview for launch vehicles, with a strong emphasis on reducing \ncost. Davidoff [1998] and Wertz and Larson [1996] discuss specific mechanisms \napplicable to low-cost and reduced cost missions. \n\nThe unconstrained number of mission options is huge, considering all possible \ncombinations of orbits, launch systems, spacecraft, and mission concepts. The goal of \nthis chapter is to prune this large number to a manageable level, without discarding \noptions that offer significant advantages. We will do so by applying the requirements \nand constraints from Chap. 1 to pare down the list of alternatives. As an example, for \nmost commercial communications applications, we would traditionally restrict our-\nselves to a geosynchronous orbit and only a few launch systems. However, the large \nnumber of low-Earth orbit communications constellations suggests that other options \nshould be considered. \n\nWith requirements and constraints defined and alternative mission concepts \nselected, we must define each concept to the level required for meaningful compari-\nsons. As Fig. 2-1 shows, we need to do this independently for each of the alternative \nmission cOncepts identified as \"A\" and \"B\" in the figure. Chapter 3 describes in more \ndetail how we then evaluate the concepts, compare them in terms of cost and perfor-\nmance, and select one or more baselines.

' \n\ne~emen~ and system c~ts using the characteristics generated in the study and the tech-\nruques In Chap. 20. This procedure results in a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost \nand an understanding of relative costs to support further trades and system evaluations. \n\n2.1 Step 3: Identifying Alternative Mission Concepts 21 \n\nIn common use, \"mission concept\" \"concept of operations:' and \"mission \narchitecture\" are frequently interchangeable and, at best, vaguely defined. Throughout \nthis chapter, we wish to clearly distinguish between them. The mission concept, dis-\ncussed in Sec. 2.1, is a broad statement of how the mission will wOIk in practice. This \nshould not be confused with mission operations, which provides the details of how \npeople will operate and control the mission. The mission architecture, introduced in \nSec. 2.2, is the mission concept plus a definition of each of the major elements of the \nmission. \n\n2.1 Step 3: Identifying Alternative Mission Concepts \n\nThe broad mission concept is the most fundamental statement of how the mission \nwill work-that is, how it gets its data or carries out the mission to satisfy the end \nuser's needs. The mission concept as we are using it here consists of the four principal \nelements in Table 2-1. Notice that most of these elements are somehow associated \nwith data or infonnation. Except for manufacturing in space and a small number of \nother space payloads, most space missions are concerned fundamentally with the \ngeneration or flow of infonnation. Thus, FrreSat's mission is to generate and commu-\nnicate to an end user infonnation about forest fires. Communications satellites move \n.data and information from one place to another. Weather, surveillance, and navigation \nsatellites are all concerned with generating and communicating information. Thus, \ndata flow is centmI to most space missions. How will FireSat determine where a lIfe \nis and how big it is? How will the system communicate that information to the fire \nfighter in a truck or plane? Once we answer these broad questions, we begin to under-\nstand FrreSat's abilities and limits. \n\nTABLE 2-1. Elements of the Mission Concept of Operations.

Section 2.2 \ndescribes how we define options and take a first cut at the broad choices available to \nus. The process of selecting among them described in Sec. 3.2 is called system trades. \nHere we are interested in what these trades are and what some of the broader alterna-\n\n\n\n22 Mission Characterization 2.1 \n\ntives are to generate and transmit data. The process of defining how to transmit the \ndata between the spacecraft and various users and controllers on the ground is called \nthe communications architecture and is discussed in Chap. 13. \n\nTABLE 2-2.

Iterate and document NlA NlA \n\nThe mission timeline differs from other elements of the mission concept in \nTable 2-1. It represents the overall schedule for developing, planning, and carrying out \nthe mission. This defines whether it is a one-time only scientific experiment or long-\nterm operational activity which will require us to replace and update satellites. In \neither case, we must decide whether the need for the mission is immediate or long \nterm. Should we give high priority to near-term schedules or allow more extensive \nplanning for the mission? Of course, much of this has to do with the funding for the \nmission: whether money is available immediately or will be available over time as we \nbegin to demonstrate the mission's usefulness. \n\n2.1.1 Data DeHvery \nSpace missions involve two distinct types of data-mission data and housekeeping \n\ndata. Mission data is generated, tmnsmitted, or received by the mission payload. This \nis the basic information that is central to what the mission is all about For FrreSat, this \ndata starts out as infrared images on a focal plane and ends up as the latitude, longitude, \nand basic characteristics of a forest fire transmitted to a fire fighter on the ground. The \nmission data has potentially very high data rates associated with it. However, the need \nfor this data may be sporiKIic. Thus, FrreSat may generate huge quantities of raw data \nduring periods of time that it is passing over the forests, but there is little need for this \nsame level of data when it is over the poles or the oceans. \n\nUltimately, the processed mission data may go directly to the end user or through \nground stations and communication networks associated with mission operations. This \nwill, of course, have a fundamental effect on how the mission works. In the first case, \nFrreSat would process its imagery and send the forest fire information as it is being \nobserved to the fire fighters in the field. In the second case, data would go instead to \n\n2.1 Step 3: Identifying Alternative Mission Concepts 23 \n\nan operations center, where a computer system or human operators would evaluate it, \ncompare it with previous data, and determine the location and characteristics of a \nforest fire. Then, the operations center would tmnsmit this information to the fire \nfighters in the field. The result is about the same in both cases, but the system's abili-\nties, limits, characteristics, and costs may be dramatically different \n\nIn contrast to the mission data, housekeeping data is the information used to \nsupport the mission itself-the spacecraft's orbit and attitude, the batteries' tempera-\nture and state of charge, and the status and condition of the spacecraft's parts. Unlike \nthe mission data, which is typically sporadic and may have huge data rates, the house-\nkeeping data is usually continuous and at a low data rate. Continuously monitoring \nsystem performance does not require much information transfer by modem standards. \nIn addition, rather dian going to the end user, housekeeping data goes to the system \nmonitoring and control activity within mission operations. Although housekeeping \nand mission data are distinct, we often need housekeeping data to make the mission \ndata useful. For example, we must know the spacecraft's orbit and attitude to deter-\nmine the ground lookpoint of the payload sensors and thereby locate the fire. \n\nFor both mission and housekeeping data, the data delivery system should be an \ninformation management-oriented process. We want to take a large amount of raw \ndata, frequently from a variety of sensors, and efficiently transform it into the infor-\nmation the users need and provide it to them in a timely manner. We do not know at \nfirst whether sending FireSat data directly to the field or sending it first to a mission \noperations center for interpretation and analysis is the best approach. But we do know \nour choice will dramatically affect how well FrreSat works and whether or not it is an \nefficient and effective system. \n\nThe principal trades associated with data delivery are: \n\n\u2022 Space vs. ground-how much of the data processing occurs on board the space-\ncraft vs. how much is done at mission operations or by the end user? \n\n\u2022 Central vs. distributed processing-is one computer talking to another computer, \nor does one large central computer on the spacecraft or on the ground process \neverything? \n\n\u2022 Level of autonomy'\" -how much do people need to intervene in order to provide \nintelligent analysis and minimize costs? \n\nThese trades are strongly interrelated. Thus, autonomy is important by itself, but is \nalso a key element of the space vs. ground trade. If human intervention is required (i.e., \nit can't be done autonomously), then the process must be done on the ground-or it \nmust be a very large spacecraft. We will discuss each of these trades below after we \nhave looked at the data delivery process as a whole. Autonomy is discussed in \nSec. 2.1.2, because it is also critical to tasking and control. \n\nThe best way to start looking at the data-delivery problem is a data-flow analysis. \nThis defines where the data originates and what has to happen to it before it gets to \nwhere it needs to go. To examine the data flow we can use a data-jlow diagram as \nshown in Fig. 2-2 for the FrreSat mission. A data-flow diagram lets us outline the tasks \nwhich we need to do, even though we don't understand yet how we will do most of \nthem. For FrreSat we know that we need some type of information collection, probably \n\n\u2022 The language here can be confusing. An autonomous operation runs without human interven-\ntion. An autonomous spacecraft runs without intervention from outside the spacecraft. . \n\n\n\n24 Mission Characterization 2.1 \n\na camera or imager or some other mechanism for detecting fIreS. As shown across the \ntQ}LnLW ofEIg. 2-2. this imaging information must be digitized, probably filtered in \nsome fashion, and transferred to a map of forest regions. We must then interpret the \nimage to identify whether a fire exists, incorporate the results on a map, and distribute \nthe map to the end user. \n\nSpacecraft \nor Ground \n\n~, Data Soun:e \n\n'e.. .,~, Data End User \n\nSpacecraft \nor Ground \n\nOrbit and attitude data are also part \nof the \"housekeeping\" sy$teJII \n\nFire Control \nCentral \n\nRg. 2-2. AreSat Data-Row Diagram. The purpose of the data flow is to view the space mis-\nsion from a data-oriented perspective. We want to know where thE! data comes from, \nwhat processing must be done, and where the results are used. Our principal mission \nobjective is to provide the necessary data to the end user at minimum cost and risk. \n\nTo put the image on a map, we need to detennine the spacecraft's orbit and attitude. \nThe attitude will almost certainly be detennined on board. The orbit may be deter-\nmined either on board or by observations from the ground. In either case, the orbit and \nattitude information are combined to determine where on the ground the sensor is \nlooking. We then select the map corresponding to the area we are looking at so we can \ncorrelate the sensor data with some physical location the fire fighters recognize. \n\nEven though we are not certain yet how the data will be used, we can be fairly sure \nthat our end data from FireSat will have several applications other than immediate use \nby the fire fighters. We will want to archive it in some central location for record-\nkeeping and improving our capacity to analyze and interpret future data. Finally, we \nwill sort out a large amount of ancillary data, such as statistics, reports, and forest-\nmanagement information, and use it over an extended period. The need for this data \ndoes not have the real-time demand of the fire data itself. \n\nThe importance of the data-flow diagram is that it lets us see what has to happen in \norder to make our mission work. For FireSat, we need to combine the mission sensor \nwith orbit and attitude information in order to make our system work in real time. \nHowever, the most difficult step is probably the one labeled \"Image Interpretation and \nAnalysis.\" Can an automated system quickly detect forest fires and send information \ndirectly to the user, or do we need extensive interpretation and analysis by trained \npeople in mission operations? What type of experiments or information must we have \nto determine which of these is possible? Even after we have selected an approach, we \n\n2.1 Step 3: Identifying Alternative Mission Concepts 25 \n\nshould revisit it regularly to see that it still makes sense. If we decide that FlieSat's \nreal-time requirements demand data processing in a computer on board the spacecraft, \nwe may dramaticaI1y drive up the cost because onboard processing is expensive. Our \nmission analysis may result in an automated FrreSat which costs several times the \nannual budget of the FOrest Service. If so, we need to reconsider whether it would be \nmore economical to have an analyst on the grOlmd interpret the data and then simply \nphone the results to an appropriate fire station. The data-flow diagram is valuable in \nhelping to identify and track these central issues. \n\nWe will now look at two of the three principal trades associated with data delivery: \nspace vs. ground processing and central vs. distributed processing. Section 2.1.2 and \nChap. 23.3 discuss the level of autonomy. \n\nSpace vs. ground processing trades. In most earlier space missions, ground \nstations processed nearly all of the data because spacebome processors could not do \nmuch. Chapter 16 describes several reasons onboard processing lags ground process-\ning. But many onboard processors are now available with dramaticaI1y increased \ncapacity. Consequently, a major trade for future missions is how much to process data \non board the spacecraft vs. on the ground, either at a mission-operations facility or \nwith the end user. \n\nSection 3.2 describes how we undertake these and other system trades and compare \nthe results. The main issues in the space vs. ground trade are as follows: \n\n1. Autonomy-how independent do we want the system to be of analysis and con-\ntrol by a mission operator? If evaluation by people is critical, we must do much \nof the data processing on the ground. If autonomous processing is appropriate, \nit can be done on board the spacecraft, at a central ground facility, or among the \nend users. The level of autonomy is both a key trade in its own right and an \nelement of the space vs. ground trade. -\n\n2. Data latency-how late can the data get to the end user? If we are allowed only \nfractions of a second, we must go to automated processes, probably on board the \nspacecraft. For FireSat, although we need the data in \"near real time,\" the delays \nassociated with sending the data to the ground for processing are not critical. \n\n3. Communications bandwidth-how much data needs to be transmitted? If we \nhave large amounts of data from a sensor, we should process and compress it as \nnear the source as possible. Bringing down all of the FrreSat imaging data and \nthen deciding what to process further on the ground will cause an enormous \ncommunications problem and will probably drive up the FrreSat mission's cost \nneedlessly. \n\n4. Single vs. multiple users-H there are a large number of end users, as would be \nthe case for FrreSat, we may be able to save considerable money by doing a high \nlevel of processing on board the spacecraft and sending the results directly down \nto the individUal users. \n\n5. Location of end user-is the \"end user\" for any particular data element on the \nground or in space? In a space-ta-space relay or a system for providing \nautomatic orbit maintenance, the end application is in space itself. In this case, \nsending data to the ground for processing and then returning the results to the \nspace system can be very complex and costly. On the ground, the comple,?~ of \nthe system is strongly affected by whether there is one end user at the JDlSSIOn \noperations center or multiple, scattered users, as in the case of FrreSat. \n\n.. \n\n\n\n26 Mission Characterization 2.1 \n\nEven if we choose to process data mostly in space, the basic system design should \nallow us to obtain or recreate selected raw data for analysis on the ground. A fully \nautomated FueSat should have some means to record or broadcast the raw imaging \ndata, so mission planners and analysts can evaluate how well the system is working, \nfix problems, and plan alternative and better techniques for later missions. \n\nTraditionally, space software has been much more expensive than ground software. \nThis suggests that processing on the ground is generally lower cost than processing on \nboard the spacecraft. We believe that this will change in the future and, therefore, soft-\nware cost should not be a major trade element in the space vs. ground processing trade. \nThe cost of software is a function of what is done and how reliable we need to make \nit, rather than where it is done. We can choose to make highly reliable software as \nnearly error-free as possible for our ground systems and this software will have the \nhigh cost inherent with most previous onboard software systems. On the other hand, \nsimple software with many reusable components can be developed economically and \nused on the spacecraft as well as on the ground. \n\nThe space vs. ground processing trade will be a key issue and probably a significant \nstumbling block for most missions in the near future. For short-lived, nontime-critical \nmissions, it will probably be more economical to work on the ground with little auto-\nmation. For long-lived missions, or time-critical applications, we will have to \nautomate the processing and then do space vs. ground trades to minimize the operation \nand end-user costs. In any case, we wish to use the data flow analysis to evaluate where \nthe data is coming from and where it will be used. If possible, we would like to mini-\nmize the communication requirements and associate data (e.g., attach time or position \ntags) as early as possible after the relevant data has been created. \n\nFor FueSat the payload sensor generates an enormous amount of data, most of \nwhich will not be useful. One way to effectively deal with large amounts of raw data \non board the spacecraft is to compress the data (i.e., reduce the amount of data to be \nstored or transmitted) prior to transmitting it to the ground. The data is then recreated \non the ground using decompression algorithms: There is a variety of methods for \ncompressing data, both lossless and lossy. Lossless data compresSion implies that no \ninformation is lost due to compression while lossy compression has some \"acceptable\" \nlevel of loss. Lossless compression can achieve about a 5 to 1 ratio whereas lossy \ncompression can achieve up to 80 to 1 reduction in data. Many of the methods of data \ncompression store data only when value changes. Other approaches are based on quan-\ntization where a range of values is com~ using mathematical algorithms or \nfractal mathematics. By using these methods, we can compress the data to a single \nalgorithm that is transmitted to the ground and the image is recreated based on the \nalgorithm expansion. With the use of fractals, we can even interpolate a higher resolu-\ntion solution than we started with by running the fractal for an extended period of time \n[Lu, 1997]. We select a method for data compression based on its strengths and weak-\nnesses, the critical nature of the data, and the need to recreate it exactly [Sayood, 1996]. \n\nWhen we transmit housekeeping data we would generally use lossless compression \nfor several reasons. First, raw housekeeping data is not typically voluminous. Second, \nit is important that none of the data is lost due to compression. However, when we \ntransmit an image we might easily use lossy compression. We could either preview the \nimage using lossy compression of we could say that the recovered image is \"good \nenough.\" Alternatively, a high resolution picture may have so much information that \nthe human eye can not assimilate the information at the level it was generated. Again, \nin this case a lossy compression technique may be appropriate. \n\n2.1 Step 3: Identifying Alternative Mission Concepts 27 \n\nIn the FrreSat example, we might use a sensor on board the spacecraft that takes a \ndigital image of the heat generated at various positions on the Earth. The digital image \nwill be represented by a matrix of numbers, where each pixel contains a value corre-\nsponding to the heat at that point on the Earth's surface. (Of course, we will need some \nmethod, such as GPS, for correlating the pixel in the image to .the location on the \nEarth.) If we assume that the temperature at each location or pixel is represented by \n3 bits, we can distinguish eight thermal levels. However, if we set a threshold such that \na '\"baseline\" temperature is represented with a 0, we might find that over many \nportions of the Earth, without fire, the image might be up to 70% nominal or O. This \nstill allows for several levels of distinction for fires or other \"hot spots\" on the Earth. \nRather than transmit a 0 data value for each cold pixel, we can compress the data and \nsend only those pixel locations and values which are not O. As long as the decompres-\nsion software understands this ground rule, the image can be exactly recreated on the \nground. In this case, we can reduce our raw data volume to the number of hot spots \nthat occur in any given area. \n\nCentral vs. distributed processing. This is a relatively new issue, because most \nprior spacecraft did not have sufficient processing capability to make this a meaningful \ntrade. However, as discussed above, the situation has changed. The common question \nnow is, \"how many computers should the spacecraft have?\" Typically, weight and \nparts-count-conscious engineers want to avoid distributed processing. However, \ncentralized processing can make integration and test extremely difficult. Because \nintegration and test of both software and hardware may drive cost and schedule. we \nmust seriously consider them as part of the processing trade. \n\nOur principal recommendations in evaluating central vs. distributed processing are: \n\n\u2022 Group like functions together \n\n\u2022 Group functions where timing is critical in a single computer \n\n\u2022 Look for potentially incompatible functions before assigning multiple functio~ \nto one computer \n\n\u2022 Maintain the interface between groups and areas of responsibility outside of the \ncomputer \n\n\u2022 Give serious consideration to integration and test before grouping multiple func-\ntions in a single computer \n\nGrouping like functions has substantial advantages. For example, attitude detP.nni-\nnation and attitude control may well reside in the same computer. They use much of \nthe same data, share common algorithms, and may have time-critical elements. \nSimilarly, orbit determination and control could reasonably reside in a single naviga-\ntion computer, together with attitude determination and control. These hardware and \nsoftware elements are likely to be the responsibility of a single group and will tend to \nundergo common integration and testing. \n\nIn contrast, adding payload processing to the computer doing the orbit and attitude \nactivities could create major problems. We can't fully integrate software and hardware \nuntil after we have integrated the payload and spacecraft bus. In addition, two different \ngroups usually handle the payload and spacecraft bus activities. The design and \nmanufacture of hardware and software may well occur in different areas following \ndifferent approaches. Putting these functions together in a single computer greatly in-\ncreases cost and risk during the integration and test process, at a time when schedule \ndelays are extremely expensive. \n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n28 Mission Characterization 2.1 \n\nAnother problem which can arise from time to time is incompatible functions, that \nis, activities which do not work well together. One example would be sporadic, \ncomputationally-intensive functions which demand resources at the same time. \nAnother example occurs when the initial processing of either spacecraft bus or payload \nsensors may well be an interrupt-driven activity in which the computer is spending \nmost of its time servicing interrupts to bring in observational data. This could make it \ndifficult for the same computer to handle computationally-intensive processing \nassociated with higher-level activities. This can be accommodated either by having the \nfunctions handled in separate computers or using a separate 110 processor to queue \ndata from the process with a large number of interrupts. \n\nFinally, we must consider the groups who oversee different activities. Integration \nand test of any computer and its associated software will be much more difficult if two \ndistinct groups develop software for the same computer. In this case, significant delays \nand risks can occur. This does not necessarily mean, however, that elements controlled \nby different groups cannot be accommodated in the same computer. One approach \nmight be to have two engineering groups be responsible for development of specifica-\ntions and ultimately for testing. The detailed specifications are then handed over to a \nsingle programming group which then implements them in a single computer. This \nallows a single group to be responsible for control of computer resources. Thus, for \nexample, the orbit control and attitude control functions may be specified and tested \nby different analysis groups. However, it may be reasonable to implement both \nfunctions in a single computer by a single group of programmers. \n\n2.1.2 Tasking, Scheduling, and Control \n\nTasking, scheduling, and control is the other end of the data-delivery problem. If \nthe purpose of our mission is to provide data or information, how do we decide what \ninformation to supply, whom to send it to, and which resources to obtain it from? \nMany of the issues are the same as in data delivery but with several key differences. \nUsually, tasking and control involve very low data rates and substantial decision \nmaking. Thus, we should emphasize how planning and control decisions are made \nrather than data management \n\nTasking and scheduling typically occur in two distinct time frames. Short-term \ntasking addresses what the spacecraft should be doing at this moment. Should FireSat \nbe recharging its batteries, sending data to a ground station, turning to look at a fire \nover Yosemite, or simply looking at the world below? In contrast, long-term planning \nestablishes general tasks the system should do. For example, in some way the FrreSat \nsystem must decide to concentrate its resources on northwestern Pacific forests for \nseveral weeks and then begin looking systematically at forests in Brazil. During con-\ncept exploration, we don't need to know precisely how these decisions are made. We \nsimply wish to identify them and know broadly how they will take place. \n\nOn the data distribution side, direct downlink of data works well. We can process \ndata on board, send it simultaneously to various users on the ground, and provide a \nlow-cost, effective system. On the other hand, direct-distributed control raises serious \nproblems of tasking, resource allocation, and responsibility. The military community \nparticularly wants distributed control so a battlefield commander can control resources \nto meet mission objectives. For FJreSat, this would translate into the local rangers \ndeciding how much resource to apply to fires in a particular area, including the surveil-\nlance resources from FJreSat. The two problems here are the limited aVailability of \nresources in space and broad geographic coverage. For example, FrreSat may have \n\n2.1 Step 3: Identifying Alternative Mission Concepts \n\nlimited power or data rates __ II! eith~ case, if one regional office controls the system \nfor a time, they may use most or all of that resource. Thus, other users would have \nnothing left. Also, FrreSat could be in a position to see fires in . Yosemite Park and \nAlaska at the same time. So distributed control could create conflicts. \n\nFor most space systems, some level of centralized control is probably necessary to \ndetermine how to allocate space resources among various tasks. Within this broad \nresource allocation, however, we may have room for distributed decisions on what \ndata to collect and make available, as well as how to process it For example, the \nremote fire station may be interested in information from a particular spectral band \nwhich could provide clues on the characteristics of a particular fire. If this is an a~ \npriate option, the system must determine how to feed that request back to ~e satellite. \nWe could use a direct command, or, more likely, send a request for specific data to \nmission operations which carries out the request \n\nSpacecraft Autonomy. Usually, high levels of autonomy and independent opera-\ntions occur in the cheapest and most expensive systems. The less costly srstems have \nminimal tasking and control simply because they cannot afford the operations cost for \ndeciding what needs to be done. Most often, they continuously ~ on one of ~ ~ew \nactivities, such as recovering and relaying radio messagc:s or Co~tinuouslr transIDltting \nan image of what is directly under the spacecraft. What IS done IS determined automat-\nically on board to save money. In contrast, the most ~xpensive sys~~ have au!onomy \nfor technical reasons such as the need for a very rapId response (1D1SSile detection sys-\ntems), or a problem ~fvery long command delays (interplanetary missions). Typically, \nautonomy of this type is extremely expensive because the system must make complex, \nreliable decisions and respond to change. . . \n\nAutonomy can also be a critical issue for long missions and for constell~tions, ~ \nwhich cost and reliability are key considerations. For example, long-duration orbIt \nmaneuvers may use electric propulsion which is highly efficient, ~ut slow. (See \nChap. 17 for details.) Thruster firings are ordinarily controlled and morutored from ~e \nground, but electric propulsion maneuvers may take several months. B~use m~ru\u00ad\ntoring and controlling long thruster burns would cost too much, electric propulSIon \nrequires some autonomy. . \n\nAs shown in Fig. 2-3, autonomy can add to mission reliability simply by redu~g \nthe complexity of mission operations. We may need to automa~ l~g~ constellati~ns \nfor higher reliability and lower mission-ope~tio~ cos!S. Mam~g the relative \npositions between the satellites in a constellabon IS routine but reqwres many.co~\u00ad\nputations. Thus, onboard automation-with monitoring and operator overnde if \nnecessary\"\"'::'will give us the best results. . \n\nWith the increased level of onboard processing available, it is clearly poSSIble to \ncreate fully autonomous satellites. The question is, should we do so or should we \ncontinue to control satellites predominantly from the ground? . \n\nThree main functions are associated with spacecraft c~trol: controlling !he \npayload, controlling the attitude of the spacecraft and its appendages, an~ contro~g \nthe spacecraft orbit. Most space payloads and bus systems do not reqwre real-time \ncontrol except for changing mode or handling anomalies. Thus, the FJreSat payload \nwill probably fly rather autonomously until a command changes a mode or an anoma1! \nforces the payload to make a change or raise a warning. Autonomous, or at least seIDl-\nautonomous. payloads are reasonable for many satellites.

Comparison of Traditional vs. Autonomous Approach to SateUIte NavigaHon. \nUse of autonomous operations may significantly reduce mission complexity and there-\nby Increase reliability. \n\nthe payload, but we would use some automatic operations to save money or to make \nthe operator's job easier. \n\nControlling the attitude of the spacecraft and its appendages is done autonomously \non board for nearly all satellites. Controlling the attitude from the ground is too expen-\nsive and too risky. The attitude control system on board most spacecraft provides \nvarious attitude control modes and can work over extended periods with little or no \nintervention from the ground. \n\nGround control has remained strongest in orbit maintenance and control, in which \nvirtually all thruster firings intended to change the orbit are set up and enabled by \nground command. This ground control will probably continue whenever large rocket \nengines produce orbit maneuvers such as when a kick stage moves the satellite from a \nparking orbit into a geosynchronous transfer orbit Once in their operational orbit, \nhowever, many satellites either leave the orbit entirely uncontrolled or simply \nmaintain the orbit at a given altitude or within a given window. In this case, low-thrust \npropulsion is both feasible and desirable because it is much less disturbing to the \nnormal spacecraft environment Low-thrust orbit maneuvers have been used on \ngeosynchronous spacecraft for a long time so normal satellite operations can continue \nduring the course of these stationkeeping maneuvers. \n\nWith low-thrust propulsion and current technology for autonomous navigation, \nautonomous orbit control is cheap, easy, and inherently less risky than autonomous \nattitude control. If the attitude control system stops working for even a short time, the \nspacecraft can have various potential problems, inCluding loss of power, loss of \ncommand, and pointing of sensitive payloads toward the Sun. In contrast, if we lose \nlow-thrust orbit control for a while, nothing disastrous happens to the spacecraft. The \nspacecraft proceeds in its orbit drifting slowly out of its predefined position. This is \neasily detected and corrected by the ground, assuming that the orbit control system \ndidn't fail completely. \n\n2.1 Step 3: Identifying Alternative Mission Concepts 31 \n\nThe major problem facing autonomous orbit control and, therefore, with autono-\nmous satellites as a whole, is tradition. The ground does it mostly because it has always \nbeen done that way. However, there are some\" signs of change. Both UoSAT-l2 and \nEO-l are planning experiments in autonomous orbit control and several of the low-\nEarth orbit communications constellations have baselined autonomous orbit control to \nminimize both cost and risk. \n\nCurrent satellite technology allows us to have fully autonomous, low-cost satellites. \nAutonomy can reduce cost and risk while enabling mission operations people to do \nwhat they do best-solve problems, handle anomalies, and make long-term decisions. \nWe believe fully autonomous satellites, including autonomous orbit maintenance, will \ncome about over the next decade as lower costs and risks, validated by on-orbit \nexperiments, begin to outweigh the value of tradition. \n\n2.1.3 Mission Timeline \n\nThe mission timeline is the overall schedule from concept definition through \nproduction, operations, and ultimately replenishment and end of life. It covers in-\ndividual satellites and the whole system. Table 2-3 lists the mission timeline's main \nparts and where they are discussed. Notice that two distinct, potentially conflicting, \ndemands can drive planning and production. One is the demand for a particular sched-\nule or time by which the system must be operational. Thus, a Halley's Comet missi()n \ndepends on launching a satellite in time to rendezvous with the comet On the other \nhand, funding constraints frequently slow the mission and cause schedule gaps which \nadd both further delays and cost Of course, funding constraints can affect much more \nthan timelines. They can determine whether we will do a mission, as well as its scope. \n\nTABLE 2-3. Prlnclpel Elements of the Mission nmellne. Key milestones In the mission or \nproject timelfne can have a significant effect on how the space system Is designed \nand operated. \n\nElement Typically Driven By Where Discussed \n\nPlanning and Funding constraints Sec. 12, \nDevelopment System need date Chap. 1 \n\nProduction Funding constraints Chap. 12 \nTechnology davelopment \nSystem need date \n\nInitial Launch Launch avallabmty Chap. 18 \nSystem need date \n\nConstellation Production schedule Sec. 7.6.1 \nBuild-up Launch availability \n\nSatellite lifetime \n\nNormal Miss/on Planned operational life Chap. 14 \nOperallons Satenite lifetime (planned or failure constrained) \n\nReplenishment Production schedule Sec. 19.1 \nLaunch avaHabll1ty \nSatellite lifetime (planned or faHure constrained) \n\nEnd-of\u00b7Life Legal and poUtlcaJ constraints Sec. 21.1 \nDisposal Danger to other spacecraft \n\n\n\n32 MIssion . Cbaracterlzation 2.2 \n\nIf the mission involves a constellation of satellites, a key timeline driver is the need \ntohavethefoll constellation\u00b7 up for most of the satellite's lifelime. If a single satellite \nwill last 5 years and we need a constellation of 50, we'll never get a full constellation \nwith a launch rate of 5 per year. If having the full constellation is important, we must \ndeploy the initial constellation within 20-25% of an individual satellite's lifetime. \nThis schedule allows some margin for almost inevitable stretch-out as difficulties arise \nduring the mission. If the constellation must remain complete, we need to plan for \nregular replenishment of satellites. We can replenish on a predefined timeline as \nsatellites wear out or become technically obsolete, or we can respond to on-orbit \nfailures or other catastrophic events which ~'kill\" a particular satellite. \n\nTwo areas of the mission timeline typically do not receive adequate attention \nduring concept exploration: performance with less than a full set of satellites while \nbuilding up the constellation, and end-of-life disposal. In a constellation of satellites \nwe would like to increase performance levels as we add satellites. If FrreSat is a con-\nstellation, we want to achieve some protection from fires with the first satellite launch \nand more with each added launch until all satellites are in place. As described further \nin Sec. 7.6, designers of constellations often concentrate only on the full constella-\ntion's. performance. However, the period of time before the constellation is brought \nfully mto place can frequently be long and may well be a criJical phase since a large \nfraction of the funding has been spent and yet full capability has not been achieved. \nThus it is particularly important for constellation design to take into account the prob-\nlem of performance with less than a full set of satellites. In addition, we want graceful \ndegradation, so a satellite failure will still allow strong performance until we replace \nthe failed satellite. These issues are important during concept exploration because they \nmay significantly affect the design of the constellation and the entire system. \n\nThere is now growing concern with disposal of satellites after their useful life in \norbit. We have already recognized this need for geosynchronous satellites because the \ngeosynchronous ring is rapidly filling. But it is also very important for low-Earth orbit \nconstellations in which debris and spent satellites left in the pattern can threaten the \nremaining constellation. Again, we must address this issue early in concept defmition. \n\n2.2 Step 4: Identifying Alternative Mission Architectures \n\nA mission architecture consists of a mission concept plus a specific set of options \nfor the eight mission elements defined in Sec. 1.2. Although we need all of the \nelements to define and evaluate a mission architecture, some are more critical than \nothers in determining how the space mission will meet its objectives. Typically, we \ndefine a mission architecture by specifying the mission concept plus the subject, orbit, \ncommunications architecture, and ground system. These provide a framework for \ndefining the other elements. Alternatively, we may define the architecture by specify-\ning a unique approach to mission operations or a unique payload which then drives the \ndefinition of the remaining elements \n\nOur goal is to arrive at a set of candidate architectures for further evaluation large \nenough to encompass all approaches offering significant advantages, but small enough \nto make the more detailed definition and evaluation manageable. Table 2-4 summariz-\nes the mechanism for doing this, which we describe below. \n\n~tep~. !dentify the mission elements subject to trade. We begin by examining our \nbasIC IDlSSlon concept and each of the eight mission elements in light of the require-\nments and constraints from Sec. 1.4 to determine which have more than one option'. \n\nStep 4:.Identifyblg Alternative Mission Architectures 33 \n\nTABLE 2-4.

Look for other alternatives which could substantially Influence how \nwe do the mission. \n\nChap. 22 \n\nUsually this step greatly reduces the number of tradeable elements. Table 2-5 summa-\nrizes this process for FIreSat. The FrreSat mission has multiple options that will affect \nnot only cost but also performance, flexibility, and long-term mission utility. Thus, for \nthis mission we shoUld carry through several different options so the decision-making \naudience can understand the main alternatives. \n\nTABLE 2-5. Selecting FlreSat Elements Which can be li'aded. Many options exist for FireSat, \nnot all of which are compatible with each other. \n\nElement of Mission Can be \nArchHecture Traded Reason \n\nMission Concept Yes Want to remain open to alternative approaches \n\nSubject No Passive subject Is well defined \n\nPayload Yes Can select complexity and frequencies \n\nSpacecraft Bus Yes Multiple options based on scan mechanism and power \n\nLaunch System Cost only Choose minimum cost for selected orbit \n\nOrbit Yes Options are low, medium, or high altitude with varying \nnumber of satellites \n\nGround System Yes Could share NOAA control facUlty, use dedicated \nFireSat facility, or direct downlink to users \n\nCommunications No FIxed by mission operations and ground system \nArchitecture \n\nMission Operations Yes Can adjust level of automation \n\nTable 2-5 lists one of the options as \"Cost only:' meaning that the trade depends \nmainly on cost and only secondarily on how or how well the mission is accomplished. \nAn example would be the launch system, for which the main concern normally is what \nlaunch vehicle will get the spacecraft into orbit at the lowest cost. Still, these trades \nmay be important in selecting the mission concept. For example, a major increase in \nthe launch cost may outweigh being able to use a smaller number of identical satellites \nin a higher orbit \n\nStep B. Identify the main options for each tradeable element. Although in theory we \nhave almost an unlimited\u00b7number of options, we normally draw them from a limited \nset such as those in Table 2-6. Thus, we frrst choose options that apply to our mission \nand then look for special circumstances which may lead us to consider alternatives not \nlisted in the table. \n\n\n\n34 Mission Characterization \n\nTABLE 2-6.

Mechanically, i~ is easy to create a ~ \nof all combinations of options identified in Step B. As a practical matter, such a list \nwould get unworkably long for most missions. As we construct the trade tree we need \nto find ways to reduce the number of combinations without eliminating options that \nmay be important \n\nThe first step in reducing the number of options is to identify the system drivers (as \ndiscussed in Sec. 2.3) and put them at the top of the trade tree. The system drivers are \nparameters or characteristics that largely determine the system's cost and perfor-\nmance. They are at the top of the trade tree because they normally dominate the design \nprocess and mandate our choices for other elements, thus greatly reducing our options. \n\nThe second step in reducing options is to look for trades that are at least somewhat \nindependent of the overall concept definition or which will ~ d~termined by the \nselection of other elements. For example, the spacecraft bus ordinarily has many key \noptions. However, once we have defined the orbit and payload, we can select the \nspacecraft bus that meets the mission requirements at the lowest cost. Again, although \nbus options may not be in the trade tree, they may playa key role in selecting workable \nmission concepts because of cost, risk, or schedule. \n\nThe third tree-pruning technique is to examine the tree as we build it and retain only \nsensible combinations. For example, nearly any launch vehicle above a minimum size \nwill work for a given orbit imd spacecraft. Because cost is the main launch-vehicle \ntrade, we should retain in the trade tree only the lowest-cost launch vehicle that will \nfulfill the mission. This does not mean that we will ultimately launch the spacecraft on \nthe vehicle listed in the trade tree. Instead, we should design the spacecraft to be com-\npatible with as many launch vehicles as pOssible and then select the vehicle based on \ncost (which may well have changed) when we are deciding about initial deployment \n\nSteps C and D produCe a trade tree such as the one for F\"rreSat in Fig. 2-4.

Look for other alternatives. Defining alternative architectures cannot be \npurely mechanical. For nearly any mission, we may find new and better ways of doing \nanything the basic elements do. A new, low-cost launch vehicle may dramatically \nchange the available design alternatives. Alternative definitions of the subject or user \n\nStep 5: Identifying System Drivers 37 \n\nmay allow major performance improvements or cost reductions. For example, as an \nalternative mission concept we could detect forest fires by using small sensors spread \nthroughout the forests being monitored and simply use the satellite system to inter-\nrogate the sensors and provide the data to the users. Chapter 22 further explores this \nlow-cost alternative. The key point is that alternatives nearly ~ways exist. We must \nlook carefully for them and be willing to revise normal requirements and constraints \nto meet our fundamental mission objectives. \n\n2.3 Step 5: Identifying System Drivers \n\nSystem drivers are the principal mission parameters or characteristics which influ-\nence performance, cost, risk, or schedule and which the user or designer can control. \nFor example, the temperature at which a forest fire burns may heavily influence how \neasily it can be detected; however, this is beyond the system designer's control and. \ntherefore, is not a system driver. Correctly identifying the key system drivers is a crit-\nical step in mission analysis and design. Misidentifying system drivers is one of the \nmost common causes of mission analysis error. For example. we may focus a lot of \ntime and effort on getting the most coverage for an orbit when the system's ultimate \npeJionnance depends mainly on data rates or cloud cover. \n\nTable 2-8 lists the most common system drivers for space missions, along with \nwhat limits them, what they limit, and where they are discussed. The table helps us \nensure that we do not overlook system drivers. In identifying these drivers we must \nclearly determine whether we are looking for drivers of performance, cost, risk, or \nschedule. These may be the same or different. To identify system drivers, we: \n\n1. Identify the Area of Interest \nExplicitly identify the area of interest, typically perfonnance, cost, risk, or \nschedule. \n\n2. Identify Parameters Which Measure the Area of Interest \nDefine numerical parameters which measure the identified area of interest. (See \nSec. 3.4 on measures of effectiveness and perfonnance parameters for more \ndetails on how to do this.) The important point is to find parameters which gen-\nuinely measure the goal rather than ones which simply are easy to compute. \n\n3. Develop First-Order Algorithms \nDevelop a fonnula or algorithm to express the first-order estimate for the value \nof the parameter identified above. This could include either system algorithms \nas defined in Sec. 3.1, or unique algorithms for the identified parameter. (See \nTable 2-9 for the FrreSat example.) \n\n4. Examine the Factors \nExamine each of the factors in the expression identified above. Those which can \nbe adjusted and which have the strongest effect on results are the system drivers. \n\n5. Lookfor Possible \"Hidden Drivers\" \nExamine each of the first-order algorithms for implicit variables or for factors \naffecting more than one characteristic. For example, altitude will influence \nthe ground resolution of a given instrument, the area covered by the field of \nview, and the spacecraft's velocity relative to the Earth. Therefore, it will more \nstrongly influence effective area search rates than a single formula may show. \n\n\n\n38 Mission Characterization 2.4 \n\nTABLE 2-8. Common System Drivers.

Combined with the number of spacecraft, it determines all aspects of \nspace-ta-ground and ground-to-space sensor and communication coverage. For the \nmost part, the orbit determines sensor resolution, transmitter power, and data rate. The . \norbit determines the spacecraft environment ana. for military spacecraft, strongly \ninfluences survivability. Fmally, the orbit determines the size. and cost of the launch \nand delivery system. \n\nChapter 7 gives detailed directions for orbit design. As Table 2-12 shows, the \ndesign should include parameters for the mission and transfer orbits, propellant \nrequirements, and constellation characteristics. \n\nD. Determine the Payload Size and Perfornumce (Chapters 9 and 13) \nWe next use the subject characteristics from Step 2 and orbit characteristics from \n\nStep 3 to create a mission payload concept. We can divide most mission payloads into \nsix broad categories: observation or sensing, communications, navigation, in situ sam-\npling and observations, sample return, and crew life support and transportation. More \nthan 90% of current space-system payloads observe, sense, or communicate. Even the \nnavigation payloads are basically communications payloads with ancillary data \nprocessing and stable time-base equipment to provide the navigation signal. Detailed \ndirections for sizing and definition appear in Chap. 9 for observation payloads and in \nChap. 13 for communications payloads. Table 2-13 summarizes the key parameters \nwe need to specify. \n\nSystem-level payload trades typically involve the user element. selecting a mission \norbit. and allocating pointing and tracking functions between the payload and space-\ncraft elements. User element trades involve balancing the performance of the payload \nand elements on the user's premises to get the lowest overall system cost for a given \norbit and constellation design. As an example, if a single geosynchronous spacecraft \nmust service thousands of ground stations, as for direct broadcast TV, we would min-\nimize the system cost by selecting a large, powerful spacecraft that can broadcast to \nsimple and inexpensive ground stations. A system designed for trunklioe communica-\ntion between half a dozen ground stations uses more complex and capable ground \nsystems and saves cost with simpler spacecraft. \n\n\n\n42 Mission Characterization 2.4 \n\nTABLE 2-12.

At one extreme, the payload does all the pointing independently of \nthe spacecraft attitude; an example is the use of gimballed scan platforms on the JPL \nMariner MK-ll spacecraft. At the opposite extreme, Space Telescope and Chandra \nX-Ray Observatory point the entire spacecraft with the required level of accuracy. An \nintermediate approach used on RME points the entire spacecraft to a lower level of ac-\ncuracy, allowing the payload to do fine pointing over a limited field of regard.\u00b7 \n\nE. Select the Mission Operations Approach (Chapters 13-15) \nWe next select and size the elements needed to support communications and c0n-\n\ntrol of the spacecraft and payload. Table 2-14 gives the key parameters. Typically a \nmission operations control center commands and controls the spacecraft and delivers \ndata to the user. With rare exceptions, we would choose an existing control renter, \nbased on the user's needs, downlink data rates, and, in some cases, security consider-\nations. Both NASA and the Air Force have existing systems. Particular institutions, \nsuch as Intelsat or Comsat, use custom systems. Most commercial operators employ \nsystem-peculiar control centers. If needed, we can interconnect most systems withdif-\nferent options for relaying communications. Chapter 15 details the specification, \nselection, and design of this element. \n\nTABLE 2-14.

Thus, we select the communications relay elements along \nwith the mission control system after most payload and orbit trades are complete. \nTypical options are SGLS for Air Force missions or IDRSS/GSIDN with the NASA \nmission control centers. Custom systems are required for some applications and are \ncommonly used for\u00b7 commercial missions in geosynchronous orbit. Chapter 13 \ndescribes communications architectures, and Chap. 14 treats operations. \n\n\n\n44 Mission Characterization \n\nF. Design the Spacecraft to Meet Paylotul, Orbit, and Communications \nRequ~nwnU(~url0) \n\n2.4 \n\nThe spacecraft and its subsystems support the payload in the mission orbit-point \nit and supply power. command and data handling. and thermal control. They must be \ncompatible with the communications architecture and mission-operations concept. \nThese elements. along with the launch system. drive the spacecraft design. We usually \nchoose the launch system that costs the least to place the minimum required weight in \nthe mission or transfer orbit. Once we make this selection. the spacecraft\u00b7s stowed \nconfiguration is constrained by the shroud volume of the selected vehicle or vehicles. \nTable 2-15 summarizes the items we need to specify while defining the spacecraft. \nChapter 10 covers how we synthesize spacecraft concepts and their definition and \nsizing. \n\nTABLE 2-15.

System parameters \n\n5.1 Lifetime and reliability \n\n52 Level of autonomy \n\nA key spacecraft-versus-Iaunch-system trade is the use of integral propulsion. \nMany commercial spacecraft ride the launch system to transfer orbit and then insert \nthemselves into the mission orbit using an internal propulsion or an internal stage. \nSome DoD spacecraft. such as DSCS m and DSP. depend on a launch system with an \nupper stage for insertion directly into the mission orbit. They do not carry large \nintegral propulsion subsystems. We should consider this trade whenever the space-\ncraft and payload cost enough to justify the reliability offered by an expensive upper \nstage. \n\n2.4 Step 6: Characterizing the Mission Arcbitecture 45 \n\nAnother trade between the spacecraft and launch system involves guidance of the \nupper stage. Often. the spacecraft contro1 system can gui~ the u~per stage. which may \nallow deletion of equipment from that stage, thereby mcr~mg perfo~c~ .and \nlowering cost. This trade is particularly important when usmg three-axts-stabilized \nstages. \n\nG. Select a Launch and Orbit Transfer System (Chapter 18) . \nThe launch system and its upper stage need to deliver the spacecraft and payl~~ to \n\nthe mission orbit or to a transfer orbit from which the spacecraft can reach the lDlSSlon \norbit on its own. The chosen launch system usually determines the launch site. The \nlaunch site organization provides pre-launch processing, checkout, and installation to \nthe launch system, usually on the launch pad. \n\nLaunch vehicles and upper stages may be combined in many ways to match ~most \nany reasonable combination of payload and mission orbit. Chapter 18 de~s the \ncharacteristics and selection of launch systems. Selecting a launch system typIcally \ninvolves the trades with the spacecraft discussed above. In addition, we ~ust decide \nbetween a single spacecraft launch and manifesting two or more spa~ecraft m a shared \nlaunch. In general, multiple manifesting costs less, but constratns the sched~e. \nFinally, we should bring certain launch-system parameters to the s~stem level desIgn \nprocess: type of vehicle, cost per launch, and flow times for processmg and prelaunch \nactivities at the launch site. \n\nH. Determine Logistics, Deploynwnt, Replenishment, and Spacecraft Disposal \nStrategies (Sections 7.6, 19.1, and 21.2) . . . . \nLogistics is the process of planning to supply and mamtain the space lDlSSlon over \n\ntime. Whereas only\u00b7 military missions typically demand fo~al pl~s~ the ~ \ndescribed in Sec. 19.1 can strongly affect costs for any multi-year lDlSSlon reqwnng \nextended support. Historically, most life-cycle costs have been locked in ~y the end of \nconcept exploration, so we must evaluate operations, support, replemshment, and \nmechanisms during this phase. . .. . \n\nPlanners often overlook the sequence for building up and mamtainmg satellite \nconstellations. To deploy a constellation effectively, we must create performan~ \nplateaus which allow us to deploy in stages and to degrade the system gracefully If \nindividual satellites fail. These performance plateaus develop from the constellation \ndesign. as described in Sec. 7.6. . . . . \n\nSection 21.2 describes the ever-increasing problem assOCIated WIth orb,tal debns, \nconsisting of defunct satellites and associated parts. B.eca~ of.this proble~, all new \nsatellite designs should plan for deorbiting or otherwise disposmg of satelhtes at the \nend of their useful life. In particular, satellites must be removed from areas such as the \ngeostationary ring, where they would seriously threaten other spacecraft or any low-\nEarth orbit constellation. \n\nI. Provide Costing Support for the Concept-Definition Activity. (Chapter. 20) \nDeveloping costs for system elements is vital to two objectives: fmding the best \n\nindividual mission architecture and comparing mission architectures at the system \nlevel. Chapter 20 describes parametric, analogous, and bottoms-up methods for \ncosting. Typically, for concept exploration. we use o~y the first two ~use w~ lack \na detailed definition of the design. At this level, we sunply want relative.compansons \nrather than absolute\u00b7 estimates, so we can accept the greater uncertainty m these \nmethods. \n\n\n\n46 Mission Characterization 2.4 \n\nReferences \n\nAgrawal, Brij N. 1986.

This chapter shows how we evaluate the a~ility. of these OptiO~ to \nmeet fundamental mission objectives. We address how to Identify the key reqwre-\nments which drive the system design. how to quantify mission performance, and how \nto select one or more concepts for further development or to decide that we cannot \nachieve the mission within current constraints or tecbnology. \n\nAlthough essentially all missions go through mission evaluation and analysis stages \nmany times, there are relatively few discussions in the literature of the gen~raI p~ \nfor doing this. Fortescue and Stark [1995] discuss the process for genenc mISSIOnS; \nPrzemieniecki [1993, 1994] does so for defense missions; and Shishko [1~5} pr0-\nvides an excellent overview for NASA missions.

By \naddressing them when we fIrst explore concepts, we cannot obtain definitive :mswers. \nBut we can form the right questions and identify ideas, parameters, and reqwrements \nwe should be monitoring throughout the design. More extensive discussions of this \nsystems engineering process are provided by Rechtin [1991} and the System Engineer-\n\n47 \n\n\n\n48 Mission Evaluation 3.1 \n\ning ~ana?ement [Defense ~ystems Manage~ent College, 1990]. The NASA Systems \nEngmeenng Handbook [ShlShko, 1995} proVIdes an excellent and detaIled account of \nthe process used by NASA. Przemieniecki [1990a, b] provides a good introduction to \nmathematical methods associated with military programs and has an associated \nsoftware package. Other software packages intended specifically to support mission \nevaluation include Satellite Tool Kit (STK) from Analytical Graphics (1998) the Mis-\nsion Utility/Systems Engineering module (MUSE) from Microcosm (1998) and the \nEdge product family from Autometric (1998). ' \n\n3.1 Step 7: Identification of Critical Requirements \n\nCritical requirements are those which dominate the space mission's overall design \nand, therefore, most strongly affect performance and cost ... \u00b7For a manned mission to \nMars, the critical requirements will be clear: get to Mars all of the required mass to \nexpl?re the planet and return, and maintain crew safety for a long mission in widely \n~aryIng e~V1ronments. For less ambitious space missions, we cannot establish the crit-\nIC~ .requrrements so easilr. B~cause we want to achieve the best performance at \nmInImum cost, we need to Identify these key requirements as early as possible so they \ncan be a part of the trade process. \n\nTable 3-1 lists the mos~ common criti~ req~ments, the areas they typically \naff~t, and where they are dISCussed. There IS no SIngle mechanism to find the critical \nreqUIrements for any particular mission. Like the system drivers discussed in Sec. 2.3 \nthey may be a function of the mission concept selected. Consequently once w~ \nestablish the alternative mission concepts, we usually can determine the critical \nreq~rements by inspection. Often, concept explomtion itself exposes the requirements \nwhich dominate the system's design, performance, and cost. One approach to identi-\nfication of critical requirements is as follows: \n\n1. wok at the princil!al perjon:zance requirements. In most cases, the principal \nperfo~ce requrre?Ient WIll be one of the key critical requirements. Thus, \nfor FtreSat, the requrrements on how well it must detect and monitor forest \nfires would normally be principal drivers of the system design. \n\n2. Examine Table 3-1. The next step is to look at the requirements list in \nTable 3-1 and determine which of these entries drive the system design, per-\nfonnance, or cost. \n\n3. wok l!t top-level requirements. Examine each of the top-level requirements \nestabhsh~ when we defined the mission objectives (Sec. 1.3) and determine \nhow we WIll meet them. For each, ask whether or not meeting that require-\nment fundamentally limits the system's design, cost, or performance. \n\n4. Look/or hidden requirements \u2022. In some cases, hidden requirements such as \nthe need to use particular technologies or systems may dominate the mission \ndesign, and cost. \n\n\u2022 Cri~cal requireme~ts sh~ul.d be distinguished from system drivers (as discussed ~ Sec. 2.3), \nwhich are the ~~g III!SSIO~ p~te~ most strongly affecting perfoI1l1lll1Ce, cost, and risk. \nThe go~ of mISSIOn engmeenng IS to adjUst both the critical requirements (e.g., coverage and \nreso~u~on) and the sy~m drivers (e.g., altitude and aperture) to satisfy the mission objectives \nat mImmwn cost and nsk. \n\n3.2 Mission Analysis 49 \n\nTABLE 3-1.

For the low-cost \nFrreSat of Chap. 22, they are covemge and sensitivity. Resolution no longer concerns \nus because the sensing is being done by ground instruments whose positions are \nknown well enough for accumte location. \n\n3.2 Mission Analysis \n\nMission analysis is the process of quantifying the system parameters and the result-\ning performance. A particularly important subset of mission analysis is mission utility \nanalysis, described in Sec. 3.3, which is the process of quantifying how well the sys-\ntem meets its overall mission objectives. Recall that the mission objectives themselves \nare not quantitative. However, our capacity to meet them should be quantified as well \nas possible in order to allow us to make intelligent decisions about whether and how \nto proceed. Mission requirements, introduced in Chap. 1 and discussed in more detail \nin Chap. 4, are the numerical expressions of how well the objectives must be mel They \nrepresent a balance between what we want and what is feasible within the constraints \non the system and, therefore, should be a central part of the mission analysis activity. \nIn pmctice, mission analysis is often concerned with how and how well previously \ndefined mission requirements can be mel In principle, mission analysis should be the \nprocess by which we define and refine mission requirements in order to meet our broad \nobjectives at minimum cost and risk. \n\nA key component of mission analysis is documentation, which provides the orga-\nnizational memory of both the results and reasons. It is critical to understand fully the \nchoices made, even those which are neither technical nor optimal. We may choose to \napply a particular technology for political or economic reasons, or may not have \nenough manpower to investigate alternatives. In any case, for successful analysis, we \nmust document the reaJ. reasons so others can reevaluate them later when the situation \nmay be differenl Technical people often shy away from nontechnical reasons or try to \n\n\n\n50 Mission Evaluation 3.2 \n\njustify decisions by exaggerating their technical content For example, we may choose \nfor our preliminary FrreSat analysis a circular orbit at 1,000 Ian at an inclination of \n60 deg because this is a good mid-range starting point. If so, we should document this \nas the reason rather than trying to further justify these parameters. Later, we or others \ncan choose the best altitude and inclination rather than having to live by choices for \nwhich there is no documented justification. \n\n3.2.1 The Mission Analysis merarchy \n\nI like to think of the mission analysis process as a huge electronic spreadsheet \nmodel of a space system. On the left side of the spreadsheet matrix are the various \nparameters and alternatives that one might assess, such as power, orbit, number of sat-\nellites, and manning levels for ground stations. Along the bottom row are the system's \nquantitative outputs, indicating its performance, effectiveness, cost, and risk. The \nmatrix itself would capture the functional relationships among the many variables. We. \nwould like to wiggle any particular parameter, such as the diameter of the objective in \na detector lens or the number of people assigned to the ground station, and determine \nthe effect on all other parameters. In this way, we could quantify the system's perfor-\nmance as a function of all possible variables and their combinations. \n\nFortunately for the continuing employment of mission analysts, the above spread-\nsheet model does not yet exist\u00b7 Instead, we analyze as many reasonable alternatives \nas possible so we may understand how the system behaveS as a function of the princi-\npal design features-that is, the system drivers. This approach does not imply that we \nare uninterested in secondary detail, but simply recognizes that the mission analysis \nprocess, much like the space system we are attempting to analyze, is ultimately limited \nin both cost and schedule. We must achieve the maximum level of understanding with-\nin these limits. \n\nIf the resources available for concept exploration are limited, as is nearly always \nthe case in realistic situations, then one of the most critical tasks is to intelligently limit \nthe scope of individual analyses. We must be able to compute approximate values for \nmany parameters and to determine at what level of detail we should reasonably stop. \nIn practice, this is made difficult by the continuing demand for additional detail and \ndepth. Thus, we must be able to determine and make clear to others what elements of \nthat detail will significantly affect the overall system performance and what elements \nwhile important, can reasonably be left to a more detailed design phase. ' \n\nWe use two main methods to limit the depth of analysis in any particular area. The \nfirst is to clearly identify each area's system drivers by the methods in Sec. 2.3 and to \nconcentrate most of the mission analysis effort on these drivers. The second is to \nclearly identify the goal of the system study and to provide a level of detail appropriate \nto that goal. This approach leads to a mission analysis hierarchy, summarized in \nTable 3-2, in which studies take on increased levels of detail and complexity as the \nactivity progresses. The first three types of studies are meant to be quick with limited \ndetail and are not intended to provide definitive results. The last three are much more \ncomplex ways to select an alternative to provide the best system performance. \n\n\u2022 The Design-to-Cost model at JPL [Shishko, 1996] and similar models being developed \nthroughout the aerospace community are attempting to automate this basic design process of \nevaluating the system-wide implication of changes. In due course, system engineers may \nbecome technologically obsolete. Much like modern chess players, the challenge to future \nsyste~ engineers will be to stay ahead of the computer in being creative and innovative. \n\n! 3.2 Mission Analysis 51 \nTABLE 3-2.

We will outline these methods very briefly \nhere. However, nearly the entire book is devoted to the process of making initial \nestimates, which is the basic goal of limited scope studies. We want to be able to \nunderstand whether or not a particular project is feasible, and to get some idea of its \nsize, complexity, and cost. Doing this requires that we be able to make numerical \nestimates and undertake limited studies in order to develop insight into the nature of \nthe problem we are trying to solve. \n\nThe biggest difficulty with limited scope studies is the tendency to believe that they \nare more accurate than they really are. Thus it is not uncommon to use a feasibility \nassessment or point design to establish the requirements for a mission in such detail \nthat in practice the point design becomes the only alternative which can meet them. As \nlong as we recognize the limited scope of these studies, they have a valuable place in \nthe mission analysis activity and represent one of the most important tools that we caD \nuse to understand the behavior of the system we are designing. \n\nFeasibility Assessment. The simplest procedure in the mission analysis hierarchy \nis the feasibility assessment, which we use to establish whether a particular objective \nis achievable and to place broad bounds on its level of complexity. Frequently, we can \ndo a feasibility assessment simply by comparison with existing systems. Thus, we are \nreasonably convinced that FireSat is feasible because most FrreSat tasks could be \nperformed by existing Earth resources satellites. Similarly, it is feasible to land a man \non the Moon and return him safely to Earth because we have done so in the past \n\nWe can also determine whether a particular goal is feasible by extrapolating our \npast experience. Is it feasible to send people to Mars and bring them back safely? Here \nwe need to look at the principal differences between a Mars mission and a lunar \n\n\n\n52 Mission Evaluation 3.2 \n\nmission. These differences include a longer flight time and higher gravity and, \ntherefore, higher lift-off velocity required to leave Mars. These factors make the job \nmore challenging and possibly more expensive than going to the Moon, but there is \nnothing about the Mars mission which makes it inherently impossible. Getting to Mars \nis feasible .. The problem is being able to do sO at modest cost and risk. \n\nThe third method of providing a feasibility assessment is to provide a very broad \ndesign of how such a mission might be accomplished. For example, in the 1970s, \nGerard O'Neill of Princeton University proposed building large space colonies at the \nLagrange points between the Earth and the Moon [O'Neill, 1974]. No mission of this \nscope had ever been undertaken, and it certainly was not a straightforward \nextrapolation of any of our normal space experience. O'Neill and his colleagues \nproceeded to establish the feasibility by developing a variety of alternative designs \nfor such space colonies [Richard D. Johnson and Charles Holbrow, 1977]. While the \nwork done was far in excess of a simple feasibility assessment, it clearly estab-\nlished that such colonies were feasible and gave at least an estimate of the scope of the \nproblem. \n\nSizing Estimate. The purpose of the sizing estimate is to provide an estimate of \nbasic mission parameters such as size, weight, power, or cost. We can do sizing esti-\nmates in much the same manner as the feasibility assessment: by analogy with existing \nsystems. Thus, if we are aware of an Earth observation system which has resolution \nand information characteristics comparable to what we believe are needed for FrreSat, \nwe can use these parameters to give us an initial estimate of the FireSat parameters. \n\nWe can provide a quantitative estimate of key mission parameters by scaling the \nparameters from existing missions or payloads in order to obtain estimates of the com-\nponent sizes for our particular mission. This scaling process is described in Sec. 9.5 \nfor space payloads, and in Sec. 10.5 for the spacecraft as a whole. The process of sizing \nby scaling existing equipment is an extremely powerful approach to estimating what \nit will take to achieve mission objectives. It is of use not only during the conceptual \ndesign process, but throughout the hardware design definition and development \nphases to evaluate the system design as it evolves. If scaling existing systems leads to \nthe suggestion that a particular component should be twice as heavy as the current \ndesign suggests, this gives us reason to look very closely at the current design and to \ntry to determine whether or not any factors have been overlooked. We assume that \ndesigners of previous systems did a reasonable job of optimizing their system. If the \ncurrent design is significantly different, either better or worse, then we would like to \nunderstand the reasons for these differences. This is a good way to gain confidence in \nthe design process as we proceed. \n\nAs the design proceeds, more and more accurate sizing estimates come from the \nscaling process. We proceed by breaking down the system into components and sizing \nindividual components based on scaling estimates with prior systems. Thus, we may \ninitially estimate the system as a whole divided into a spacecraft and ground station. \nAs the design becomes more detailed, we will break down the spacecraft into its rela-\ntive components and estimate the size, weight, and power of each element based upon \nscaling from prior systems or engineering estimates of the new system to be built. Sim-\nilarly, we initially size the ground station by comparison with existing systems and \neventually by building a list of all the ground system components and undertaking \nsimilar sizing estimates for each component. As introduced in Chap. I, this process of \ncreating a list of components and estimating parameters for each is known as budget-\ning and is described in more detail in Sec. 10.3. \n\n3.2 Mission Analysis 53 \n\nPoint Design. A point design is a design, possibly at a top level, for the entire \nsystem which is capable of meeting the broad mission objectives. We refer to it as a \npoint design if we have not attempted to optimize the design to either maximize \nperformance or minimize weight, cost, or risk. The point design serves two basic \npurposes. It demonstrates that the mission is feasible, and it can be used as a baseline \nfor comparison of alternatives. Thus, if we can establish a point design for FrreSat that \nmeets mission objectives with a spacecraft that weighs 500 kg and costs $50 million, \nthen we can use this as a comparison for later systems. If other systems cost more, \nweigh more, and do not perform as well, then we will abandon those alternatives in \nfavor of the original baseline. If we continue to optimize the design so that the cost and \nrisk decrease, then we will let the baseline evolve to take into account the new design \napproaches. \n\nA point design is valuable because we can do it quickly and easily. There is no need \nto optimize any of the parameters associated with the design unless it is necessary to \ndo so to meet mission objectives. This gives us a sense of whether it will be easy or \nhard to meet the mission objectives and what are likely to be the most difficult aspects. \nOne of the biggest problems in a point design is taking it too seriously at a later stage. \nWe are always likely to regard work which we have done as representing the best \napproach, even though we may not have been aware of alternatives. The key issue here \nis to make use of point designs but at the same time to recognize their limitations and \nto continue to do trades to reduce overall cost and risk and to look for alternative \napproaches to meet mission objectives. \n\n3.2.3 Trade Studies \n\nDeciding whether to proceed with a mission should be based on a strawman system \nconcept or point design which shows that the mission objectives can be met within the \nassigned constraints. Of course, the point design may not be the best solution, and we \nwould ordinarily consider a number of alternatives. The system trade process evalu-\nates different broad concepts to establish their viability and impact on performance \nand cost. We then combine the system trade results with the mission utility analysis \ndescribed in Sec. 3.3 to provide input for concept selection. \n\nSystem trades consist of analyzing and selecting key parameters, called system \ndrivers, which determine mission performance. We use these parameters to define a \nmission concept and mission architecture which can then be used for performance \nanalysis and utility analysis as described in Sec. 3.3. The key system trades are those \nthat define how the system works and determine its size, cost, and risk. Typically, the \nkey system trades will be in one of the following major areas: \n\n\u2022 Critical requirements \n\n\u2022 Mission concept \n\n\u2022 Subject \n\n\u2022 Type and complexity of payloads \n\n\u2022 Orbit \n\nTable 3-3 shows typical examples of areas in which there are key system trades for \nrepresentative missions. For essentially all missions, specification of the critical \nrequirements will be a key system trade. For the FireSat mission, the subject is \n\n\n\n54 Mission Evaluation 3.2 \n\nprobably the heat from the fire itself and the payload is probably an IR sensor. Thus, \nthe principal system trades are probably the mission concept, the resolution and \ncoverage requirements, and the orbit. For a mission such as the Space Telescope, the \norbit is of marginal importance and the subject is moderately well defined, if only very \npoorly knOWD. Here the principal trades will be the resolution and pointing require-\nments, the payload, and the mission concept. Communications satellite systems are \nnormally in geosynchronous orbit with a well defined concept of operations. Here the \nonly real trade is with the required traffic load, the subject, and the size and complexity \nof the payload. \n\nTruly innovative approaches-those that really change how we think about a \nproblem-typically involve finding a new option among these key system trades. \nMotorola's Iridium program and subsequent low-Earth orbit communications constel-\nlations represent a new way of thinking about using satellites for communications. \nThese have a very different concept of operations and different orbit from traditional \nsystems. Similarly, Chap. 22 presents an innovative approach to thinking about \nFueSat that provides a totally different concept of operations and type of payload. \nInnovative solutions are never easy to come by. To try to find them, a good place to \nstart is with the key system trade areas given in Table 3-3. . \n\nTABLE 3-3. Representative Areas for Key System Trades. Although these system trades are \ncritical, we can't expect numerically precise answers to our system design problem. \n\nWhere Space Communications \nTrade Area DIscussed FlreSat Telescope Satellite \n\nCritical Requirements Chap. 3 Yes Yes Yes \nMiss/on Concept Chap. 2 Yes Yes No \nSubject Chap. 9 No No Yes \nPayload Type and cOmplexity Chaps. 9,13 No Yes Yes \nDrbit Chap. 7 Yes No No \n\nWe cannot normally do system trades in a straightforward numerical fashion. \nChoosing a different concept of operations, for example, will result in changes in most \nor all of the mission parameters. Consequently, the fact that Option A requires twice \nthe power of Option B mayor may not be critical, depending on the orbit and number \nof satellites for the two options. We need to look at the system as a whole to understand \nwhich is better. \n\nThe best approach for key system trades is a utility analysis as described in Sec. 3.3. \nWe use the utility analysis to attempt to quantify our ability to meet mission objectives \nas a function of cost. We then select the option which fulfills our objectives at the low-\nest cost and risk. As descn\"bed in Sec. 3.4, this is still not a straightforward numerical \ncomparison, but does have quantitative components. \n\nThe simplest option for system trades is a list of the options and the reasons for \nretaining or eliminating them. This allows us to consider the merits and demerits at a \nhigh level without undertaking time-consuming trades. This, in turn, allows our list to \nbe challenged at a later date. We should go back to our key system trades on a regular \nbasis and determine whether our assumptions and conclusions are still valid. It is this \nprocess of examination and review that allows us to use technical innovation and new \nideas. It is a process that must occur if we are to drive doWD the cost of space systems. \n\n3.2 Mission Analysis S5 \n\nThe alternative to simply articulating trade options or conducting a complex mis-\nsion utility analysis is a system trade in which we make a quantitative comparison of \nmultiple effects. This can be particularly effective in providing insight into the impact \nof system drivers. For the purpose of trade studies, system drivers generally divide into \ntwo categories-those for which more is better and those with multiple effects. By far \nthe easier to deal with are the \"more is better\" drivers, for they simply require us to \nask: \"What is the cost of achieving more of the commodity in question?\" For example, \nin a space-based radar, added power improves performance but costs more money. \nThus, the designer will want to understand how much performance is available for \nhow much power. A second example is coverage. For virtually any Earth-oriented \nsystem, including our FrreSat example, more coverage means better performance at \nhigher cost. Increasing coverage ordinarily means adding satellites or, perhaps, \nincreasing a single satellite's coverage by increasing its altitude or the range of its \nsensors. Therefore, we often do a coverage trade considering performance vs. number \nof satellites, substituting the latter for cost. Assessing performance as a function of \npower or coverage may take considerable work, but it is relatively easy to present the \ndata for judging by the funding organizatiQn, the users, or other decision makers. \n\nSystem drivers and critical requirements which cause multiple effects demand \nmore complex trade studies. Pushing parameters one way will improve some charac-\nteristics and degrade others. In trades of this type, we are looking for a solution which \nprovides the best mix of results. Examples of such trade studies include instrument \ndesign, antenna type, and altitude. Each antenna style will have advantages and dis-\nadvantages, so we must trade various possible solutions depending upon the end goals \nand relative importance of different effects. \n\nIn trades with multiple effects, selecting the correct independent parameter for each \ntrade is critical. Consider, for example, selecting either a reflector or a phased-army \nantenna for a space-based radar [Brookner and Mahoney, 1986]. From the radar equa-\ntion, we know that a principal performance parameter for a radar is the antenna \naperture. All other things being equal, larger antennas will provide much better perfor-\nmance. Thus, for our example, we might choose to compare reflector and phased-army \nantennas of equal aperture. On this basis, we would choose the phased array because \nits electronic steering makes it more agile than a reflector antenna, which must be \nmechanically steered. But our choice becomes more complex when we recognize that \nweight typically limits large space structures more than size does. Generally, we can \nbuild a reflector larger than a phased array for a given weight. Based on weight, a \nreflector may have considerably more power efficiency and, therefore, be a better \nradar than a phased-array system. Thus, we would have to trade the better performance \nofa larger reflector vs. the better agility of a smaller phased array. Depending upon \nthe application, the results may be the same as for an aperture-based trade or reverse. \nThe important point is the critical nature of selecting the proper independent variable \nin system trades. To do so, we must find the quantities which inherently limit the \nsystem being considered. These could be weight, power, level of technology, cost, or \nmanufacturability, depending on the technology and circumstances. \n\nTable 3-4 summarizes the system trade process for parameters with multiple \neffects. Typically the trade parameter is one of our system drivers. We begin by iden-\ntifying what performance areas or requirements affect or are affected by the trade \nparameter. For example, the altitude of the spacecraft will have a key effect on COVel'-\nage, resolution, and survivability and will be limited by launchability, payload weight, \ncommunications, and radiation. We next assess the effect in each of these areas and \n\n\n\nMission Evaluation 3.2 \n\ndocument and summarize the results, generally without trying to create a numerical \naverage of different areas. Figure 3-1 shows this step for FrreSat We use the summary \nto select the parameter value and a possible range. Although the process is complex \nand may not have a well defined answer, it is not necessarily iterative unless we find \nthat the results require fundamental changes in other system parameters. \n\nTABLE 3-4.

Select parameter value Altitude = 700 km discussed in text \nand possible range 600 to BOO km \n\nAltitude trades are perhaps the most common example of a trade in which multiple \ninfluences push the parameter in different ways. We would normally like to move the \nsatellite higher to achieve better coverage, better survivability, and easier communica-\ntions. On the other hand.launchability, resolution, and payload weight tend to drive \nthe satellite lower. The radiation environment dictates specific altitudes we would like \nto avoid, and the eclipse fraction mayor may not play a crucial role in the altitude \ntrade. We must aSsess each of these effects and summarize all of them to complete a \ntrade study. One possible summary is a numerically weighted average of the various \noutcomes, such as three times the coverage in square nautical miles per second divided \nby twice the resolution in furlongs. Although this provides a convenient numerical \nanswer, it does not provide the physical insight or conceptual balance needed for \nintelligent choices. A better solution is to provide the data on all of the relevant param-\neters and choose based on inspection rather than numerical weighting. \n\n3.2 Mission Aualysis 57 \n\nThe FireSat altitude trade provides an example of trading on parameters with \nmultiple effects. For FrreSat, neither survivability nor communications is a key issue, \nbut coverage does push the satellite upward. On the other hand, payload weight and \ngood resolution tend to push the satellite lower. Figure 3-1 shows the results of a \nhypothetical FueSat altitude trade. Notice that each parameter has various possible \noutcomes. Altitudes above or below a certain value may be eliminated, or we may \nsimply prefer a general direction, such as lower altitude providing better resolution. \nBased on these results, we select a nominal altitude of 700 km for FrreSat and a \npossible range of 600 to 800 km. This selection is not magic. We have tried to balance \nthe alternatives sensibly, but not in a way that we can numerically justify. \n\nCharactBTlstlc Mowed Range (Ian) Comnumfs \n\nLaunch CapabDIty \u2022 Launch Vehicle UmIt Radiation \u2022 Inner Radiation Bell Coverage \u2022 Higher Is Better Coverage Evolution \u2022 Major Plateau at 375 kin Payload Resolution \u2022 Lower Is Better Communications \u2022 Higher Is Better Ufetime \u2022 Trade with Launch Umil I I I I I \n0 1,000 2,000 3,000 \n\nRg. 3-1.

Too much detail \ndrains resources away from other issues; too little keeps us from determining the \nimportant issues or causes us to assess the actual performance incorrectly. \n\nTo compute system performance, we use three main techniques: \n\n\u2022 System algorithms \n\n\u2022 Analogy with existing systems \n\n\u2022 Simulation \n\nSystem algorithms are the basic physical or geometric formulas associated with a \nparticular system or process, such as those for determining resolution in diffraction-\nlimited optics, finding the beam size of an antenna, analyzing a link budget, or \nassessing geometric coverage. Table 3-5 lists system algorithms typically used ~or \nspace mission analysis. System algorithms provide the best method for computing \nperformance. They provide clear traceability and establish the relationship between \ndesign parameters and performance characteristics. Thus, for FueSat, we are inter-\nested in the resolution of an on-orbit rue detector. Using the formula for diffraction-\nlimited optics in Chap. 9, we can compute the achievable angular resolution from the \ninstrument objective's diameter. We can then apply the geometric formulas in Chap. 5 \nto tranSlate this angular resolution to resolution on the ground. This result gives us a \n\n\n\n58 Mission Evaluation 3.2 \n\ndirect relationship between the altitude of the FrreSat spacecraft, the size of the \npayload. the angles at which it works, and the resolution with which it can distinguish \nfeatures on the ground. \n\nTABLE 3-5. Common System Algorithms Used for Quantifying Basic Levels of Perfor-\nmance. These analyses use physical or geometrical formulas to determine how \nsystem performance varies with key parameters. \n\nWhere \nAlgorithm Used For Discussed \n\nUnkBudget Communications and data rate analysis Sec. 13.3.6 \nDiffraction-limited Aperture sizing for optics or antennas; Sec. 9.3 \nOptics determining resolution \n\nPayload Sensitivity Payload sizing and performance estImetes Sees. 9.4, 9.5 \nRadar Equation Radar sizing and performance estimates [Cantaflo,1989) \nEarth Coverage, Coverage assessment; system sizing; Sees. 5.2, 7.2 \nArea Search Rates performance estImetes \n\nMapping and Geolocation; Instrument and antenna pointing; Sec. 5.4 \nPointing Budget lmege sensing \n\nSystem algorithms are powerful in that they show us directly how performance \nvaries with key parameters. However, they are inherently limited because they pre-\nsume the rest of the system is designed with fundamental physics or geometry as the \nlimiting characteristic. For FueSat, resolution could also be limited by the optical \nquality of the lens, by the detector technology, by the spacecraft's pointing stability, \nor even by the data rates at which the instrument can provide results or that the satellite \ncan transmit to the ground. In using system algorithms, we assume that we have \ncorrectly identified what limits system performance. But we must understand that \nthese assumptions may break down as each parameter changes. Fmding the limits of \nthese system algorithms helps us analyze the problem and determine its key compo-\nnents. Thus, we may find that a low-cost FrreSat system is limited principally by \nachieving spacecraft stability at low cost. Therefore, our attention would be focused \non the attitude control system and on the level of resolution that can be achieved as a \nfunction of system cost \n\nThe second method for quantifying performance is by comparing our design with \nexisting systems. In this type of analysis we use the established characteristics of \nexisting sensors, systems, or components and adjust the expected performance accord-\ning to basic physics or the continuing evolution of technology. The list of payload \ninstruments in Chap. 9 is an excellent starting point for comparing performance with \nexisting systems. We could. for example, use the field of view, resolution, and integra-\ntion time for an existing sensor and apply them to FJreSat. We then modify the basic \nsensor parameters such as the aperture, focal length, or pixel size, to satisfy our mis-\nsion's unique requirements. To do this, we must work with someone who knows the \ntechnology, the allowable range of modifications, and their cost For example, we may \nbe able to improve the resolution by doubling the diameter of the objective, but doing \nso may cost too much. Thus, to estimate performance based on existing systems, we \nneed information from those who understand the main cost and performance drivers \nof that technology. ' \n\nThe third way to quantify system performance is simulation, described in more \ndetail in Sec. 3.3.2. Because it is time-consuming, we typically use simulation only for \n\n3.3 Step 8: Mission Utility \n\nkey performance parameters. However, simulations allow much more complex mod-\neling and can incorporate limits on performance from multiple factors (e.g., resolution, \nstability, and data rate). Because they provide much less insight, however, we must \nreview the results carefully to see if they apply to given situations. Still, in complex \ncircumstances, simulation may be the only acceptable way to quantify system perfor-\nmance. A much less expensive method of .simulation is the use of commercial mission \nanalysis tools as discussed in Sec. 3.3.3. \n\n3.3 Step 8: Mission Utility \n\nMission utility tuUllysis quantifies mission performance as a function of design, \ncost, risk, and schedule. It is used to (1) provide quantitative information for decision \nmaking, and (2) provide feedback on the system design. Ultimately, an individual or \ngroup will decide whether to build a space system and which system to build based on \noverall performance, cost, and risk relative to other activities. As discussed in Sec. 3.4, \nthis does not mean the decisiori is or should be fundamentally technical in nature. \nHowever, even though basic decisions may be political, economic, or sociological, the \nbest possible quantitative information from the mission utility analysis process should \nbe available to support them. \n\nMission utility analysis also provides feedback for the system design by assessing \nhow well altemative configurations meet the mission objectives. FJreSat shows how \nthis process might work in practice. Mission analysis quantifies how well alternative \nsystems can detect and monitor forest fires, thereby helping us to decide whether to \nproceed with a more detailed design of several satellites in low-Earth orbit or a single \nlarger satellite in a higher orbit As we continue these trades, mission analysis \nestablishes the probability of being able to detect a given forest fire within a given \ntime, with and without FrreSat, and with varying numbers of spacecraft. For FireSat, \nthe decision makers are those responsible for protecting the forests of the United \nStates. We want to provide them with the technical information they need to determine \nwhether they should spend their limited resources on FrreSat or on some alternative. \nIf they select FrreSat, we will provide the technical information needed to allow them \nto select how many satellites and what level of redundancy to include. \n\n3.3.1 Performance Parameters and Measures of Etfectiveness \n\nThe purpose of mission analysis is to quantify the system's performance and its \nability to meet the ultimate mission objectives. Typically this requires two distinct \ntypes of quantities-performance parameters and measures of effectiveness. Perfor-\nmonee parameters, such as those shown in Table 3-6 for FrreSat, quantify how well \nthe system works, without explicitly measuring how well it meets mission objectives. \n\n. Performance parameters may include coverage statistics, power efficiency, or the \nresolution of a particular instrument as a function of nadir angle. In contrast, measures \nof effectiveness (MoBs) or figures of merit (FoMs) quantify directly how well the \nsystem meets the mission objectives. For FrreSat, the principal MoE will be a numer-\nical estimate of how well the system can detect forest fJreS or the consequences of \ndoiJig so. This could. for example, be the probability of detecting a given forest fire \nwithin 6 hours, or the estimated dollar value of savings resulting from early fire detec-\ntion. Table 3-7 shows other examples. \n\n\n\n60 Mission Evaluation 3.3 \n\nTABLE 3-6.

For example, \neither by analysis or simulation we can assess the level of covemge for any point on \nthe Earth's surface. A probability of detecting and containing forest fires better \nmeasures our end objective, but is also much more difficult to quantify. It may depend \non how we construct scenarios and simulations, what we assume about ground \nresources, and how we use the FrreSat data to fight fires. \n\nGood measures of effectiveness are critical to successful mission analysis and \ndesign. Ifwe cannot quantify the degree to which we have met the mission objectives, \nthere is little hope that we can meet them in a cost-effective fashion. The rest of this \nsection defines and chamcterizes good measures of effectiveness, and Sees. 3.3.2 and \n3.3.3 show how we evaluate them. \n\nGood measures of effectiveness must be \n\n\u2022 Clearly related to mission objectives \n\u2022 Understandable by decision makers \n\n\u2022 Quantifiable \n\n\u2022 Sensitive to system design (if used as a design selection criterion) \n\nMoBs are useless if decision makers cannot understand them. \"Accelemtion in the \nmarginal rate of forest-fire detection within the latitudinal covemge regime of the end-\nof-life satellite constellation\" will'likely need substantial explanation to be effective. \nOn the other hand, clear MoBs which are insensitive to the details of the system design, \nsuch as the largest covemge gap over one year, cannot distinguish the quality of one \n\n. system from another. Ordinarily, no single measure of effectiveness can be used to \nquantify how the overall system meets mission objectives. Thus, we prefer to provide \n\n3.3 Step 8: MIssion Utility 61 \n\na few measures of effectiveness summarizing the system's capacity to achieve its \nbroad objectives. \n\nMeasures of effectiveness generally fall into one of three broad categories associ-\nated with (1) discrete events, (2) covemge of a continuous activity, or (3) timeliness of \nthe information or other indicators of quality. Discrete events include forest fires, \nnuclear explosions, ships crossing a barrier, or cosmic my events. In this case, the best \nmeasures of effectiveness are the rate that can be sustained (identify up to 20 forest \nfires per hour), or the probability of successful identification (90% probability that a \nforest fire will be detected within 6 hours after ignition). The probability of detecting \ndiscrete events is the most common measure of effectiveness. It is useful both in pro-\nviding good insight to the user community and in allowing the user to create additional \nmeasures of effectiveness, such as the probability of extinguishing a forest fire in a \ngiven time. \n\nSome mission objectives are not directly quantifiable in probabilistic terms. For \nexample, we may want continuous covemge of a particular event or activity, such as \ncontinuous surveillance of the cmb nebula for extmneous X-ray bursts or continuous \nmonitoring of Yosemite for tempemure variations. Here the typical measure of effec-\ntiveness is some type of covemge or gap statistics such as the mean observation gap or \nmaximum gap under a particular condition. Unfortunately, Gaussian (normal proba-\nbility) statistics do not ordinarily apply to satellite covemge; therefore, the usual \nmeasure of avemge values can be very misleading. Additional details and a way to \nresolve this problem are part of the discussion of covemge measures of effectiveness \nin Sec. 7.2. \n\nA third type of measure of effectiveness assesses the quality of a result mther than \nwhether or when it occurs. It may include, for example, the system's ability to resolve \nthe tempemture of forest fires. Another common measure of quality is the timelineSs \nof the data, usually expressed as time late, or, in more positive terms for the user, as \nthe time margin from when the data arrives until it is needed. Timeliness MoBs might \ninclude the avemge time from ignition of the forest fire to its initial detection or, \nviewed from the perspective of a potential application, the avemge warning time \nbefore a fire strikes a population' center. This type of information, illustmted in \nFig. 3-2, allows the decision maker to assess the value of FneSat in meeting commu-\nnity needs. \n\n3.3.2 Mission Utility Simulation \n\nIn analyzing mission utility, we try to evaluate the measures of effectiveness \nnumerically as a function of cost and risk, but this is hard to do. Instead, we typically \nuse principal system pammeters, such as the number of satellites, total on-orbit weight, \nor payload size, as stand-ins for cost. Thus, we might calculate measures of effective-\nness as a function of constellation size, assuming that more satellites cost more money. \nIf we can establish numerical values for meaningful measures of effectiveness as a \nfunction of the system drivers and understand the underlying reasons for the results, \nwe will have taken a major step toward quantifying the space mission analysis and \ndesign process. \n\nRecall that mission utility analysis has two distinct but equally important goa1s---to \naid design and provide information for decision making. It helps us design the mission \nby examining the relative benefits of alternatives. For key parameters such as payload \ntype or ovemll system power, we can show how utility depends on design choices, and \ntherefore, intelligently select among design options. \n\n\n\n62 \n\nO---t \n\nMission Evaluation \n\nState \nof Alert \n\nPreparations \nBegIn \n\nI \nI \nI \nI \nI \n\n-72 -48 -24 \n\nMeasure of Effectiveness = Warning TIme (hours) \n\nFIre \nHits \n\n3.3 \n\nFig. 3-2. Forast Fire Warning TlmB for Inhabited Areas. A hypothetical measure of effective-\nness for FlreSat \n\nMission utility analysis also provides information that is readily usable to decision \nmakers. Generally those who determine funding levels or whether to build a particular \nspace system do not have either the time or inclination to assess detailed technical \nstudies. For large space programs, decisions ultimately depend on a relatively small \namount of information being assessed by individuals at a high level in industry or \ngovernment A strong utility analysis allows these high-level judgments to be more \ninformed and more nearly based on sound technical assessments. By providing sum-\nmary performance data in a form the decision-making audience can understand, the \nmission utility analysis can make a major contribution to the technical decision-\nmaking process. \n\nTypically, the only effective way to evaluate mission utility is to use a mission \nutility simulation designed specifically for this purpose. (Commercial simulators are \ndiscussed in Sec. 3.3.3.) This is not the same as a payload simulator, which evaluates \nperformance parameters for various payloads. For FrreSat, a payload simulator might \ncompute the level of observable temperature changes or the number of acres that can \nbe searched per orbit pass. In contrast, the mission simulator assumes a level of \nperformance for the payload and assesses its ability to meet mission objectives. The \nFrreSat mission simulator would determine how soon forest fires can be detected or \nthe amount of acreage that can be saved per year. \n\nIn principle, mission simulators are straightforward. In practice, they are expensive \nand time consuming to create and are rarely as successful as we would like. Attempts \nto achieve excessive fidelity tend to dramatically increase the cost and reduce the \neffectiveness of most mission simulators. The goal of mission simulation is to estimate \nmeasures of effectiveness as a function of key system parameters. We must restrict the \nsimulator as much as possible to achieving this goal. Overly detailed simulations \nrequire more time and money to create and are much less useful, because computer \ntime and other costs keep us from running them enough for effective trade studies. The \n\n3.3 Step 8: Mission Utility 63 \n\nsimulator must be simple enough to allow making multiple runs, so we can collect \nstatistical data and explore various scenarios and design options. \n\nThe mission simulation should include parameters that directly affect utility, such \nas the orbit geometry, motion or changes in the targets or background, system sched-\nuling, and other key issues, as shown in Fig. 3-3. The problem of excessive detail is \nbest solved by providing numerical models obtained from more detailed simulations \nof the payload or other system components. For example, we may compute FrreSat's \ncapacity to detect a forest fire by modeling the detector. ~si~vity, atmospheric char-\nacteristics, range to the fire, and the background conditions m the observed area. A \ndetailed payload simulation should include these parameters. After running the pay-\nload simulator many times, we can, for example, tabulate the probability of detecting \na fire based on observation geometry and time of day. The mission simulator uses this \ntable to assess various scenarios and scheduling algorithms. Thus, the mission simu-\nlator might compute the mission geometry and time of day and use the lookuIJ. table to \ndetermine the payload effectiveness. With this method, we can dramatically reduce \nrepetitive computations in each mi~sion simulatm: run,. do ~ore simul~ti~ns, ~ \nexplore more mission options than WIth a.more detailed sunulation. The JlllSSlon SllD-\nulator should be a collection of the results of more detailed simulations along with \nunique mission parameters such as the relative geometry between the satellites i? a \nconstellation, variations in ground targets or background, and the system scheduling \nor downlink communications. Creating sub-models also makes it easier to generate \nutility simulations. We start with simple models for the individual components and \ndevelop more realistic tables as we create and run more detailed payload or component \nsimulations. \n\nSimulator & \nMain Models /.

Political constraints and survivabDity were not of concem for the \nFlreSat altitude trade. \n\nTable 3-8 shows the typical sequence for simulating mission utility, including a \ndistinct division into data generation and output This division allows us to do various \nstatistical analyses on a single data set or combine the outputs from many runi; in dif-\nferent ways. In a conStellation of satellites, scheduling is often a key issue in mission \nutility. The constellation's utility depends largely on the system's capacity to schedule \n\n\n\n64 Mission Evaluation 3.3 \n\nresource use appropriately among the satellites. At the end of a single simulation run, \nthe system should collect and compute the statistics for that scenario, generate appro. \npriate output plots or data, and compute individual measures of effectiveness, such as \nthe percent of forest fires detected in that particular run. \n\nTABLE 3-8. Typical Sequence Flow of a TIme-Stepped Mission UtIlity Simulation. Follow. \ning this sequence for many runs, we can create statistical measures of effective-\nness that help us evaluate our design. \n\nPhase 1- Data Generation \nAdvance time step \nCompute changes In terget or background characteristics \nUpdate satenite positions \nUpdate viewing geometry parameters \nSchedule observations or operations \nCompute pointing changes \nCompute and seve performance statistics \nUpdate setenite consumables \nSave data for this time step \nGo to next time step \n\nPhase\" - Output Generation and Statistics Collection \nCompute scenario statistics \nCompute measures of effectiveness tor the Individual run \nPrepare output plots and data tor the individual run \n\nPhase ID - Monte Carlo Runs \nSet new scenario start time \nRepeat Phase I and II \nCollect multi-run statistics \nCompute statistical measures of effectiveness \nPrepare Monie Cario output plots and data \n\nThe next step is to run more simulations using new start times or otherwise varying \nthe conditions for the scenarios. Changing the start times alters the relative timing and \ngeometry between the satellites and the events they are observing, thus, averaging \nresults caused by these characteristics. Collecting statistics on multiple runs is called \na Monte Carlo simulation. For example, we might average the percentage of forest \nfires detected over different runs with different timing, but on the same scenario, to \nestimate the overall probability of detecting forest fires-our ultimate measure of \neffectiveness. The system simulator should accumulate output statistics and prepare \noutput plots over the Monte Carlo runs. \n\nFrequently, in running mission simulations, we must choose between realistic and \nanalytical scenarios. Realistic scenarios usually are too complex to help us understand \nhow the system works but are still necessary to satisfy the end users. On the other hand, \nsimple scenarios illuminate how the system is working but do not show how it will \nwor~ ~ a real ~ituation. The ~ answer is to use simple scenarios for analysis and \nrealistic scenanos to assess lDlSSlon performance. In the FrreSat example, we might \nbegin by studying a single satellite to determine how it behaves and then expand to a \nmore complex simulation with several satellites. We might also start evaluating a \n\n3.3 Step 8: Mission Utility 65 \n\nmulti-satellite constellation by looking at its response to a simple situation, such as one \nfire or a small group of uniformly distributed fires. This trial run will suggest how the \nsystem performs and how changes affect it. We can then apply this understanding as \nwe develop more realistic simulations. \n\nA related problem concerns using a baseline scenario to compare options and \ndesigns. Repeating a single scenario allows us to understand the scenario and the \nsystem's response to it. We can also establish quantitative differences by showing how \ndifferent designs respond to the same scenario. But this approach tends to mask char-\nacteristics that might arise solely from a particular scenario. Thus, we must understand \nwhat happens as the baseline changes and watch for chance results developing from \nour choice of a particular baseline scenario. \n\nFinally, mission simulations must generate usable and understandable information \nfor decision makers--imormation that provides physical insight. Two examples are \nstrip charts of various system characteristics and animated output. A strip chart plot is \nsimilar to the output of a seismograph or any multi-pin plotter, in which various char-\nacteristics are plotted as a function of time. These characteristics might include, for \nexample, whether a particular satellite is in eclipse, how much time it spends in active \nobservation, and the spacecraft attitude during a particular time step. Plots of this type \ngive a good feel for the flow of events as the simulation proceeds. \n\nA valuable alternative for understanding the flow of events is looking at an anima-\ntion of the output, such as a picture of the Earth showing various changes in the target, \nbackground, and observation geometry as the satellites fly overhead. Thus, as Fig. 3-4 \nillustrates, an animated simulation of FireSat output could be a map of a fire-sensitive \nregion with areas changing color as fires begin, lines showing satellite coverage, and \nindications as to when fires are first detected or when mapping of fires occurs. \nAnimation is not as numerical as statistical data, but it shows more clearly how the \nsatellite system is working and how well it will meet broad objectives. Thus, mission \nanalysts and end users can assess the system's performance, strengths and short-\ncomings, and the changes needed to make it work better. \n\n3.3.3 Commercial Mission Analysis and Mission Utility Tools \n\n. Creating a mission utility simulation for your specific mission or mission concept \nis both time consuming and expensive. It is not uncommon for the simulation to be \ncompleted at nearly the same time as the end of the study, such that there is relatively \nlittle time to use the simulation to effectively explore the multitude of options available \nto the innovative system designer. \n\nIn my view, the single largest step in reducing software cost and risk is the use of \ncommercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) software. The basic role of COTS software in space \nis to spread the development cost over multiple programs and reduce the risk by using \nsoftware that has been tested and used many times before. Because the number of \npurchasers of space software is extremely small, the savings will be nowhere near as \nlarge as for commercial word processors. Nonetheless, reductions in cost, schedule, \nand risk can be substantial. Most COTS software should be at least 5 times cheaper \nthan program-unique software and is typically 10 or more times less expensive. In \naddition, COTS software will ordinarily have much better documentation and user \ninterfaces and will be more flexible and robust, able to support various missions and \ncircumstances. \n\nThe use of COTS software is growing, but most large companies and government \nagencies still develop their own space-related software for several reasons. One of the \n\n\n\n66 Mission Evaluation 3.3 \n\nRg. 3-4. HypotheUcaJ AnlmaUon Output for RreSat MIssIon UUJIty Slmulator. Color dis-\nplays are very valuable for animation sequences because we need to convey multiple \nparameters in each frame. \n\nbest ways to develop and maintain expertise is to create your own systems and models. \nThus, organizations may want to support their own software group, particularly when \nmoney is tight. Also, it's hard to overcome the perception that it costs less to incre-\nmentally upgrade one's own system than to bear the cost and uncertainty of new COTS \ntools. In this trade, the \"home built\" systems often don't include maintenance costs. \nFmally, customers often don't know which COTS tools are available. Professional \naerospace software doesn't appear in normal software outlets, advertising budgets are \nsmaIl, and most information is word-of-mouth through people already in the commu-\nnity. Despite these substantial obstacles, many organizations are now using COTS \nsoftware in response to the strong demand to reduce cost. \n\nIn order to use COTS tools to reduce space system cost, we need to change the way \nwe use software. We need to adapt to software not being exactly what we want, look \nfor ways to make existing software satisfy the need, or modify COTS software to more \nclosely match requirements. This is a normal part of doing business in other fields: \nVery few firms choose to write their own word processor, even though no single word \nprocessor precisely meets all needs. Instead, they choose one that most closely \nmatches what they want in terms of functions, support, and ease of use. We should use \nthe same criteria for COTS space software. In addition, we need to set realistic \nexpectations concerning what COTS software can do. Clearly, we can't expect the low \nprices and extensive support that buyers of globally marketed commercial software \nenjoy. We have to adjust our expectations to the smaller market for space-related soft-\nware, which means costs will be much higher than for normal commercial products. \nMaintenance and upgrades will ordinarily require an ongoing maintenance contract. \nWithin the aerospace community, a standard arrangement is for a maintenance and \nupgrade contract to cost 15% of the purchase price per year. \n\nUsing COTS software and reusing existing noncommercial softWare requires a \ndifferent mindset than continuously redeveloping software. We need to understand \nboth the strengths and weaknesses of the relatively smaII space commercial software \n\n3.3 Step 8: Mission Utility 67 \n\nindustry. Because the number of copies sold is smaII, most space software companies \nare cottage industries with a small staff and limited resources. We shouldn't expect \nspace-software developers to change their products at no cost to meet unique needs. \nFor example, it would be unrealistic to expect a vendor of commercial software for \nlow-Earth orbit spacecraft to modify the software for interplanetary missions at no \ncost, because few groups will buy interplanetary software. On the other hand, the smaII \nsize of the industry means developers are eager to satisfy the customers' needs, so \nmost are williilg to work with their customer and to accept contracts to modify their \nproducts for specific applications. This can be far less expensive than developing soft-\nware completely from scratch. \n\nThere is a hierarchy of software cost, going from using COTS software as is, to \ndeveloping an entirely new system. In order of increasing cost, the main options are \n\n1. Use COTS software as sold \n\n2. Use COTS software libraries \n\n3. Modify COTS software to meet specific program needs (modification may be \ndone by mission developer, prime contractor, or software developer) \n\n4. Reuse existing flight or ground software systems or modules \n\n5. Develop new systems based largely on existing software components \n\n6. Develop new systems from scratch using formal requirements and develop-\nment processes \n\nThis hierarchy contains several potential traps. It may seem that the most economical \napproach would be for the prime contractor or end-user to modify COTS software to \nmeet their needs. However, it is likely that the COTS software developer is in a better \nposition to make modifications economically and quickly. Although the end-users are \nmore familiar with the objectives and the mission, the software developer is more \nfamiliar with the organization and structure of the existing code. \n\nSecondly, there is frequently a strong desire to reuse existing code. This will likely \nbe cheaper if the code was developed to be maintainable and the developers are still \navaiIable. On the other hand, for project-unique code developed with no requirement \nfor maintainability, it may be cheaper, more efficient, and less risky simply to discard \nthe old software and begin again. \n\nCommercial mission analysis tools fall into three broad categories, each of which \nis described below. Representative examples of these tools are listed in Table 3-9. \n\nGeneric Aruzlysis Systems. These are programs, such as MatLab\u2122, which are \nintended to allow analysis and simulation of a wide variety of engineering and science \nproblems. They typically cost a few hundred to several thousand dollars and can \ndramatically reduce the time needed to create simulations and analyze the results. \nBecause these are generic tools, specific simulation characteristics are set up by the \nuser, although subroutine libraries often exist. Thus, we will need to create orbit \npropagators, attitude models, environment models, and whatever else the problem \ndictates. We use this type of simulation principally for obtaining mathematical data \nand typically not for animation. \n\nLow-Cost Aruzlysis Programs. These are programs intended for a much wider \naudience such as the amateur astronomy or space science community. However, when \ncarefuIly selected and used appropriately, they can provide nearly instant results at \nvery low cost The programs themselves cost a few hundred dollars or less, are \n\nI' \n\n\n\n68 Mission Evaluation 3.3 \n\nTABLE 3-9.

A typical program in this category is Dance of the Planets, developed \nby Arc Science Simulations, for simulating astronomical events and allowing amateur \nspace enthusiasts to create simulations of solar system events and obtain views from \nspacecraft which they define. A key characteristic of this program is that it creates \nsimulations by integrating the equations of motion of celestial objects, thus allowing \nthe user to define an interplanetary spacecraft orbit and determine its interaction with \nvarious celestial bodies. While less accurate than high-fidelity simulations created \nafter a mission is fully funded, this type of tool can produce moderately accurate \nresults quickly and at very low cost \n\nA second type of system used by amateurs consists of data sets, such as star \ncatalogs, and the associated programs used to access and manipulate the data. For \nexample, the complete Hubble Guide Star Catalog, created for the Space Telescope \nmission and containing over 19 million stars and nonstellar objects, is available on two \nCD-ROMs for less than $100. Smaller star catalogs contain fewer entries, but typically \nhave much more data about each of the stars. All of the electronic star catalogs can be \nread . and star charts created by any of the major sky plotting programs, again available \noff-the-shelf for a few hundred dollars. \n\nSpace Mission Analysis Systems. These are professional engineering tools created \nspecifically for the analysis and design of space missions. Prices are several thousand \ndollars and up. These tools can create very realistic simulations, including data gener-\nation, animation, user-defined figures of merit, and Monte Carlo simulations. One of \nthe most widely used tools in this category is Satellite Tool Kit (STK), developed by \nAnalytical Graphics, which provides a basic simulation capability and a variety of add-\n\n3.4 Step 9: Mission Concept Selection 69 \n\non modules for animation generation, orbit determination and propagation, coverage \nanalysis, and mission scheduling. The Mission Utility/Systems Engineering Module \n(MUSE) by Microcosm allows the evalua~on of a variety of ~eneri~ figures of merit \n(such as coverage or timeliness) and prOVIdes Monte Carlo sllDulation runs to create \nstatistical output. MUSE is intended specifically to allow the user to define new fig-\nures of merit to allow the rapid creation of mission-specific simulatiOns. The Edge \nproduct family by Autometric provides very high-~delity animation of a variety of \nspace missions and is intended to be adapted by either ~e ~ompany or the user. to \nbecome a mission-specific simulation. Each of the tools m this category can proVIde \nhigh-fidelity simulations at a much lower cost than creating systems from scratch. \n\n3.4 Step 9: Mission Concept Selection \n\nThis section is concerned not with the detailed engineering decisions for a space \nmission, but with the broad trades involved in defining the overall mission-whether \nto proceed with it and what concep! t~ use. Decisio~ for ~pace mi~si~ns fall into ~ \nbroad categories: (1) go/no-go deC1S1on on proceeding With the lDlSSlon; (2) selection \nof the mission concept; and (3) detailed engineering decisions, which are generally \ndescribed throughout this book. . \n\nIn principle, the go/no-go decision depends on only a few factors, the most llDpor-\ntant of which are: \n\n\u2022 Does the proPosed system meet the overall mission objectives? \n\n\u2022 Is it technically feasible? \n\n\u2022 Is the level of risk acceptable? \n\n\u2022 Are the schedule and budget within the established constraints? \n\n\u2022 Do preliminary results show this option to be better than nonspace solutions? \n\nIn addition to the above technical issues, a number of nontechnical criteria are ordi-\nnarily equally or more important in the decision-making process: \n\n\u2022 Does the mission meet the political objectives? \n\n\u2022 Are the organizational responsibilities acceptable to all of the organizations \ninvolved in the decision? \n\n\u2022 Does the mission support the infrastructure in place or contemplated? \n\nFor example, a mission may be approved to keep an organization in b~iness, or it \nmay be delayed or suspended if it requires creating an infrastructure perce1ved as .not \nneeded in the long term. The mission analysis activity must incl~e nontechnical \nfactors associated with space missions and see that they are appropnately addressed. \n\nThe top-level trades in concept selection are usually not fully qUantitative, and we \nshould not force them to be. The purpose of the trade studies and utility analysis is to \nmake the decisions as informed as possible. We wish to add quantitative information \nto the decisions, not quantify the decision making. In other worru:, w~ sho~d ~ot \nundervalue the decision-maker's judgment by attempting to replace It With a sunplis-\ntic formula or rule. \n\nTable 3-10 shows how we might try to quantify a decision. Assume that a system \ncosts $500 million, but an improvement could save upto $300 million. To save this \n\n\n\n70 Mission Evaluation 3.4 \n\nmoney, we could use option A, B, or C. Option A would cost $35 million, but the prob-\nability of success is only 70%; B would cost $100 million with 99% probability of \nsuccess; C would cost $200 million with a 99.9% probability of success. \n\nTABLE 3-10. MathemaUcal Model of HYPCJtheUcaI DecisIon Process (costs In $M). Numer\u00b7 \nIcally, we would choose B or J!i If It were available. Realistically, any of the choices \nmay be best depending on the decision criteria \n\nCurrent Cost $SooM \n\nPotential Savings If Improvement Is Successful $3OOM \n\nCost of ProbabHIty Total Cost Total Cost Expected Expected \nOption Improvement of Success IfSuccessfuJ IfFaHed Total Cost Savings \n\nA 35 70% 235 535 325 175 \n\nB 100 99% 300 600 303 197 \n\nC 200 99.9O\"k 400 700 400.3 99.7 \n\n{( 35 80% 235 535 295 205 \n\nWhich option should we select? The table gives the cost if successfuI, the cost if the \nimprovement fails, and the expected values of both the cost and net savings. By \nnumbers alone, we would select option B with an expected savings .of $197 million. \nHowever,'reasonable and valid cases can be made for both A and C. In option A, we \nrisk only $35 million, and, therefore, are minimizing the total cost if the improvement \nsucceeds or if it fails. In fact, the $600 million cost of failure for option B may be too \nmuch for the system to bear, no matter the expected savings. Option C provides a net \nsavings of \"only\" $100 million, but its success is virtually certain. Although savings \nfor this option are less dramatic, it does provide major savings while minimizing risk. \nIn this case, we may assume the cost to be a fixed $400 million, with failure being so \nunlikely that we can discount it. Option B, of course, balances cost and risk to maxi-\nmize the expected savings. \n\nSuppose, however, that option A had an 80% probability of success as shown in A', \nrather than the original 70% probability. In this case, the expected savings of A' would \nincrease to $205 million, and would make it the preferred approach in pure expectation \nterms. However, most individuals or groups faced with decisions of this sort are \nunlikely to change from option B to A' based solely on the increase in estimated prob-\nability to 80%. Their decisions are more likely to depend on perceived risk or on \nminimizing. losses. Using nonmathematical criteria does not make the decisions \nincorrect or invalid, nor does it make the numerical values unimportant. We need \nquantitative information to choose between options but we do not have to base our \ndecisions exclusively on this information. \n\nAs a second example, we can apply the results of utility analysis to concept selec-\ntion for FtreSat. In particular, the number of satellites strongly drives the cost of a \nconstellation. If we select the low-Earth orbit approach for FueSat, how many sat-\nellites should the operational constellation contain? More satellites means better \ncoverage and, therefore, reduces the time from when a fire starts until it is first de-\ntected. Consequently, one of our key parameters is the time late, that is, the time from \nwhen a fire starts until the system detects its presence and transinits the information to \nthe ground. Figure 3-5 plots the hypothetical time late vs. the number of satellites for \n\n3.4 Step 9: Mission Concept Selection 71 \n\nFueSat. The details of such plots will depend on the latitude under consideration, \nswath coverage, altitude, and various other parameters. However, the characteristic of \nincreasing coverage with more satellites eventually reaches a point of diminishing \nreturns. This will normally be true irrespective of the coverage assumptions. \n\n15 ~------r-----~~----~------~------' \n\no \n2 4 6 8 10 \n\nNumber of Satellites \n\nRg. 3-5. HypotheUcal Coverage Data for RreSat. See text for definitions and dlscussIon. As \ndiscussed In Sec. 7.5, sateUite growth comes in Increments or plateaus. These are \nassumed to be 2-satelllte Increments for AreSal \n\nIf we assume an initial goal for time late of no more than 5 hours, we see from the \nplot that a system of 6 satellites can meet this goal. Alternatively, a 4-satellite system \ncan achieve a time late of 6 hours. Is the smaller time late worth the increased number \nof satellites and the money to build them? Only the ultimate users of the system can \njudge. The additional warning may be critical to fue containment and, therefore, a key \nto mission success. However, it is also possible that the original goal was somewhat \narbitrary, and a time of approximately 5 hours is what is really needed. In this case, \nfue-fighting resources could probably be used better by flying a 4-satellite system with \n6 hours time late and applying the savings to other purposes. Again, mission utility \nanalysis simply provides quantitative data for intelligent decision making. \n\nOf course, we must remember that the number of FireSat satellites will depend not \nonly on the utility analysis but also on politics, schedules, and resources. The public \nmust see FtreSat as an appropriate response to the problem, as well as an efficient use \nof scarce economic resources compared to, for example, more fire fighters. In addi-\ntion, a satellite system may serve several missions, with multiple mission criteria and \nneeds. Just as we cannot apply only one criterion to some system drivers, we may not \nbe able to balance numerically the several criteria for mission selection. Ins~ the \ndevelopers, operators, and users must balance them using the insight gained from the \nsystem trades and mission utility analysis. \n\nHaving undertaken a round of system trades, evaluated the mission utility, and \nselected one or more baseline approaches, we are ready to return to the issue of system \n\n\n\n72 Mission Evaluation 3.4 \n\nrequirements and their flow-down to various components. Chapter 4 treats this area, \nwhich is simply the next step in the iterative process of exploring concepts and defin-\ning requirements. \n\nReferences \n\nBrookner, Eli, and Thomas F. Mahoney. 1986.

Regardless of su;e and complexity, and whatever the formality and scope of this \nprocess, it should follow the general pattern described in this chapter. \n\nAll requirements must begin with succinct but well dermed user and customer \nmission needs, focusing on the critical functional and operational requirements, with-\nout unnecessarily constraining or dictating the design. Section 4.1 shows that the \nrequirements derived from these mission needs and progressively allocated to lower \nlevels of the design are central to meeting a program's performance commitments. \nSection 4.2 describes the process of analyzing requirements and budgeting perfor-\nmance. As we derive functions and the associated performance requirements, we must \ndocument them to provide the basis for developing, producing, deploying, and oper-\nating the system, as well as a referencable history governing the development. Section \n4.3 shows the role of requirements documentation. F'mally, Sec. 4.4 summarizes a \nbrief step-by-step method of establishing requirements for typical space mission \nprograms. \n\nThis traditional approach to systems engineering is to first derme the requirements \nand then design the system to meet those requirements at minimum cost and risk. More \nrecently a number of authors and organizations have advocated ''trading on require-\nments\" as a formal process intended to provide a compromise between what the user \nwants and what the buyer can afford. This process is discussed in detail by Wertz and \nLarson [1996J. \n\n73 \n\n\n\n74 Requirements. Definition 4.1 \n\n4.1 Role of Requirements in System Development \n\nTo this point, the book has dealt with the mission analysis and concept development \nprocess which ideally drives the system design. The mission objectives and system \nconcepts we have adopted have involved five basic measures: (1) required perfor-\nmance,.(2) cost, (3) ~velopment and deployment schedule, (4) implicit and explicit \nco~~ts, and (5) nsk. The same meas~ continue to apply during the entire system \nenglDeenng process, from concept to lDlplementation. Through this process, we \ndecompose and allocate the central system-derived requirements (sometimes \nexpressed as system specifications) to individual segments or system elements, inter-\nfaces between these as well as\u00b7interfaces external to the system. To define the total \nsystem, therefore, users, customers, system engineers, and segment developers must \nco~tantly interact. Although we initiate the process in a \"top-down\" fashion, we \ntypically must continually reconcile system level requirements with technology and \nlower-level design development. \n\nA healthy tension often exists between the user and development communities. \n~vel?~ may consider ~e user wedded to current operational approaches and \nlDsensltive to how over-specified requirements constrain design. Users often believe \nthat developers favor new technology and ignore the practical needs associated with \noperating a system and exploiting the mission data. Thus, the developer may establish \nmission requirements without consulting the user, or the user may produce \"non-\nnegotiable stone tablets\" and carry them down from the mountain too late or too over-\nspecified for actual use. Because both sides have valid concerns, however, they must \ncooperate from the start in developing the mission's operational requirements. We \nmay implement this cooperation through so-called IPrs (Integrated Product Teams) \ninvolving both users/customers and developers. \n\nTypically, developers wanting to build as soon as possible drive prematurely \ntoward low-level detail. Sometimes they underemphasize the original mission drivers \n-requirements which dominate performance, cost, and schedule risk. Customers \noften constrain system development with overly specific requirements at levels below \nthe critical requirements that determine most of a program's cost and risk. While the \nlevel of formality and detail may vary depending upon system maturity, complexity, \nand size, critical requirements must remain in the forefront during design. develop-\nment, and validation of the system. \n\nOverzealous requirements can also find their way into mission statements. For \nexample, a user may specify the scan rate and swath width under payload and coverage \n~on.nan~e. Clearly,. these cons~ts on sensor design and constellation are inappro-\n~nat~ lD this case,. pnor to establishing a system which meets the key requirements, \nI.e., timely data WIth enough accuracy and resolution. Specifications on launch rate, \nlaunch responsiveness, and spacecraft reliability are also common. But so long as a \nsystem meets availability and maximum outage needs, the developer should be able to \nallocate requirements for reliability, maintenance, and replacement. Mission require-\nments concerning launch, operation, or maintenance may establish the design domain \nbut .not di~tate the design. On the other hand, the user must also be a party to the syste~ \ndesIgn as It converges, to identify design characteristics likely to produce operational \nproblems. \n\nTable 1-5 in Sec. 1.4 shows essential requirements for the FJreSat mission. These \nreq~ments ?either d!ctate nor impose needless constraints on design, but they do \nSpecify what IS essential to perform the mission and operate the system. The table \n\n4.1 Role of Requirements. in System Development 75 \n\ncontains enough information to derive the specific design characteristics with \nsufficient controls on the user's essential requirements. Also, the table includes no \nunverifiable terms or goals such as ''maximize,'' \"sufficient,\" or \"optimize,\" because \nthese words have no quantifiable interpretations. Requirements which we are asked to \nimplement only if no \"impact\" results, are in fact goals and we cannot treat them as \ndesign dri,:ers. Every meanin~ requirement bears cost and will have an impact \nCo~ts are those reqUIrements for a system which we cannot trade, usually \n\nunder any crrcumstances. Th~y may pertain to performance when levels of capability \nof a sy~tem must have a ~ valu~ to be useful. One example is the necessity for a \nresolution level of an optical or RF SIgnal, above which the desired information could \nnot be derived or would not be sufficiently better than existing systems to justify new \ndevelopment. A related, fixed requirement could also be coverage and timeliness of \ndata, clearly a major consideration for FJreSat. Another might be cost-a constraint \nincreasingly important to the financial success of a new mission. Thus, if a cost ceiling \nofN millions could not be met for a new development, the feasibility, design attn'butes \nor method of achieving a mission would 00 directly affected. The term \"design to cost\" \napplies directly to a cost constraint. Schedule may also be a constraint, and many tech-\nnically worthwhile projects get scrubbed because developers could not solve some \nproblems soon enough to be competitive-this is often called a ''time to market\" con-\ns~t. Others, but by no means all, include environmental and safety issues, legal and \npolitical mandates, fixed asset usage, involvement of geographically distributed or \nforeign offset contractors. \n\nAn alternative view of \"goals\" vs. ''requirements\" is that the former represent \ndesign margin. Any firm requirement must result in a level of margin in the design. \nand we ~ regard the \"goal\" as specifying the desired margin. As the design matures. \nthe margm represents the trade-space available to decision-makers. The user must \nultimately decide whether the additional performance is worth its associated incre-\nmental cost. \n\nDesigners often focus on performance areas, such as operating the payload and \ndistributing. the. ~sion data, and ~deremphasize the more mundane requirements. \nsuch as availability and accommodation to the external environment. Yet these can be \ncri?c~ . to cost and risk. F~r example, availability can demand increased component \n~hab~ty and ~erefore raise development costs. It can drive maintenance concepts, \n~cluding ~1.eD1Shment and on-o,rbit ~Pp?rt. It. can also affect production time, espe-\ncIally for cntical components. likewise, Ignormg external interfaces can produce a \nsystem design without the external support needed to deploy and operate the mission. \n\nWhen space systems perform more than one mission, planners must develoP \nrequirements which account for each mission. For example, the IR surveillance \npa>:load o,n FlreSat may serve o~er users with its performance in IR imaging and \nradiometric measurement. If the mcreased cost and risk are acceptable, their require-\nmen~ could lead to more payload bands, added coverage, and added distribution \nreqUIrements. That is why we must establish all valid missions early in requirements \ndefinition, or we should incorporate accommodations for new missions in future \nupgrades to a system's capabilities. \n\nWhile we must address system requirements throughout all aspects of the \ndevelopment cycle, the role and characteristics of requirements change in each devel-\nopment phase. Consequently, we should use specific structure and language early in \nthe ~ss without premature detail. Table 4-1 shows how the requirements converge \ndunng system development. Concept development must continue to reflect the driving \n\n\n\n76 Requirements Definition 4.1 \n\nrequirements, including internal and external interfaces. Top level or mission \nrequirements drive early activities-developing the sy,stem concept and assessing \ntechnology. We must be prepared to modify these as the concepts and design mature \nand cause re-evaluation. \n\nTABLE 4-1. Evolution of Requirements Activities and Products.

We generally don't require formal specifications complying with acquisition \nstandards and serving as the legal basis for the system until full-scale development. At \nthat point, we need to have solved the critical program risk areas. Until then, however, \nthere are no set prescriptions for the requirements products other than what the pr0-\ngram fmds applicable and workable. \n\nWe should, of course, recognize that the spectrum of valid approaches for require-\nments development and application is broad. Significant differences exist among \nNASA, 000, ESA, NASDA and other development agencies, as well as their con-\ntractors, and even among locations within the same organization. For example, all \n\n4.1 Role of Requirements in System Development 77 \n\nNASA organizations conduct Phase A and Phase B studies which result ultimately in \na Request for Proposal, including top-level specifications. But they vary widely in \ntheir approaches to conducting these studies and their requirements products. For 000 \norganizations, the rituals of MIL-STD-499 have often overwhelmed arguments based \non unique program needs, and requirements become over-detailed and over-formal-\nized too early. In full-scale development, most of the requirements activities center on \nintegrating program interfaces (inter-segment and external to the system) and resolv-\ning ways of carrying out specific requirements at segment level. Solving major system \nissues at this point can be expensive and risky. Usually, we freeze requirements once \nthe system passes into production. Rarely can a program afford to accept changes at \nthis point, opting far more often to accept limits to the system as designed or to defer \nthe change to a later upgrade. \n\nWe often hear that requirements drive technology programs, but in fact, new \ntechnologies frequently make systems possible. For example, improvements in \nbandwidth for communications processing have permitted greater use of real-time \ndata downlinks. But relying on new technologies or production abilities can be risky. \nNew technologies which allow us to reduce design specifications for power, weight, \nand volume can improve system performance and cost. We must, however, monitor \nthe technology and production base and carry backup plans, in case program risk \nmanagement demands changes to basic design requirements and interfaces to reallo-\ncate performance. \n\nAlthough the success of every program hinges on perfonruince, cost, and schedule, \ncost is typically the most constraining. One reaction to cost emphasis is the design-to-\ncost practice by which a fixed dollar amount affects possible design solutions. Thus, \nprogressive design development may, under cost limitations, cause review of require-\nments, with attendant trades between cost and performance. This has clearly been a \nfactor in the design and functions of the International Space Station (ISS). We can do \nmuch to control program costs while analyzing requirements. For instance, over-\nspecified requirements may be \"safe,\" but evaluation of necessary design margins \nearly via close interaction between the developer and the requirements specifier \npermits us to make timely trades. \n\nAs discussed earlier, defining requirements without attending to production and \noperational support is also costly. Thus, with every major decision, we must consider \nwhich performance option meets essential requirements while minimizing cost. \n\nSometimes, standardizing can reduce costs and improve operability. For example. \nparticularly in the commercial communications industry, use of a \"standard bus\" or \nbasic vehicle can yield lower costs for many programs. We sometimes call this process \n\"platform-based design.\" In addressing approaches to standardization, however, we \nmust always consider trade-offs between reduced cost and increased development \nrisk. \n\nAs shown in Chaps. 1-3, mission development is an iterative process. Although \neach stage seems to cascade forward without hesitation, each requires significant feed-\nback and adjustments. Typically, most of the feedback occurs between adjacent phases \nof development. However, some situations may demand feedback across multiple \nphases, such as when an element design falls short on a particular requirement and \ncauses a change in the design and operations concept, and possibly a change to the \noriginal schedule. \n\nAn aside on requirements and cost control is imperative here. Solutions to \nconstraining cost (e.g., design-to-cost specification, imposed standardization) are \n\n\n\n78 Requirements Definition 4.1 \n\ndifficult to implement in truly innovative space systems. In fact, well-intentioned \naPIm>aches early in the design cycle may result in serious cost growth later in design \nand operation. But this difficulty in explicit cost control does not imply we should \navoid the challenge. The growth in cost from the early estimates performed during \nConcept Development is typically driven by a few controllable problems. Frrst, not \nfully accounting for all elements of cost in these early estimates is common. Fre-\nquently, not consulting with designers and manufacturers who will develop the system \nand the operators who will control the system results in misunderstanding cost or miss-\ning elements of cost. Second. overspecifying the system inhibits trades which we can \nfocus on cost reduction. Fmally (and probably the most prevalent problem), heavy and \nuncontrolled changes to requirements as the system proceeds through latter stages of \ndesign can create major growth in cost due to constant redesign and related material \nand time waste. Worse, the loss of a fully understood system baseline becomes more \nlikely and potentially very costly later in the program. The process of defining and \nflowing down requirements affects cost more than any other program activity. \n\n. Then, too, on several occasions, customer requirements accepted without rational \n\n. challenge have led to unjustifiable project costs and. in two well-documented cases, \neventually caused cancellation. One of the authors once had the opportunity to \nconvince a customer that a new requirement that was inserted after program start \nwould not enhance the mission; millions of dollars were saved and the customer's \nbelief in our integrity was solidified. \n\n4.1.1 Quality Function Deploym.ent-A Tool for Requirements Development \n\nWhile there are several structured approaches to developing requirements from the \ncustomerluser needs, the most commonly used tool is Quality Function Deployment, \nor QFD. Its application is not product limited; we also use it in developing of \nrequirements for processes and services. \n\nQuality Function Deployment derives from three Japanese words or characters \nmeaning (1) quality or features, (2) function or mechanization, and (3) deployment or \nevaluation. Symbolically we define the combination as \"attribute and function \ndevelopment. \"It involves a series of matrices organized to define system characteris-\ntics and attributes and can be applicable over multiple areas of decomposition. The \nfrrst level, connecting customer needs or requirements to technical attributes or \nrequirements, we often called the House of Quality and configure it in its simplest form \nas in Fig. 4-1. We often call the left hand colunm the \"Whati' (at this first level, this \nis called the ''voice of the customer\") and we call the horizontal attributes the \"Hows.\" \nThis relationship will become apparent as the \"Hows\" define the means for fulfilling \nthe \"Whats.\" \n\nWeightings are applied to the \"what\" side of the matrix and are usually graded in \nthree levels to help establish priorities of needs and related technical attributes. While \nof value in trading requirements, the primary use at this stage should be to define trade \nspace. \n\nFigure 4-2 shows a simplified application to FrreSat. Referring to Table 1-5 and \nillustrating with only a few of the identified mission needs, an abbreviated matrix \nshows some five needs and six relevant attributes. Note the conflicts between compet-\ning satellite orbits which could. potentially satisfy key requirements. This suggests \ncarrying out extensive analysis and trades. Note also the relative priorities emphasiz-\ning technical attributes which assure timely coverage. \n\n4.1 Role of Requirements in System Development \n\nRg. 4-1.

Simplified QFD for RreSat Mission. This limited set of needs and responding tech-\nnical attributes would be expanded significantly for the complete design process. \n\nRecalling the discussion on constraints (at the end of Sec. 4.1), we understand that \nthe customer needs that the system cost no more than $20 million per year of 0pera-\ntion; that is a constraint and all needs and technical attributes must meet this criterion. \nThus, while it is a fixed requirement, we may leave it off the customer needs column \nof the QFD so as not to overbalance weighted scoring. If it were stated as having a \ntarget cost of $20 million or less, we might trade that figure and put it on the left hamd \nside of the matrix. As a next stage.use of QFD, the technical attributes developed in \nthe top level would then become the requirements or \"what\" (left side) of the QFD \n\n\n\n80 Requirements DefiDition 4.2 \n\nmatrix, with definitive characteristics, such as specific orbits, coverage per pass or unit \ntime and top reliability level which we would derive to satisfy the set of specified tech-\nnical requirements. ~gure 4-3 illustrates this progression. \n\nAeonm= \n.-<:xxxxX \n\nSysIem Func!1ons f---\nand ChamcIerIsIIcs \n\ni 'i ;: \nUI \n\nl: WeIgIded Score \n\nSystem RequIrements \nPhase \n\n~ II \nt \n\nA \nT_ \n\nChamcIerIsIIcs \n\nConcept \nPhase \n\n-\n\n- II \nf \n\nA \nDesIgn \n\nRequIremenIsI \nSpeciIlcaIJDns \n\nPreDmJnary \nDesIgn Phase \n\n~ \nRequIrements SpecifIed \n\nforllelalJ DesIgn \n\nRg. 4-3.

It also serves to \nsustain the trail of requirements derivation and provides a means for analyzing the \nimpact of changes to requirements at any level. And since We can link the technical \nattributes responsive to needs, to functions of the system, there is a logical translation \nto functional analysis via functional flow diagrams and thence architecture and inter-\nface defmitions. \n\nAs an added note regarding understanding the customer, I know of several satellite \nprojects that have had little success as commercial ventures because the contractor's \ndesigners established requirements based on their own interpretation of potential \ncustomer needs. This was also the cause of a major military satellite contract loss to \nthe competition due to inaccurately presumed knowledge of customer's desires. The \nvoice of the customer must be heard before fixing a design. \n\n4.2 Requirements Analysis and Performance Budgeting \n\nWe must decompose every system requirement into progressively lower levels of \ndesign by defining the lower-level functions which determine how each function must \nbe performed. Allocation assigns the function and its associated performance require-\nment to a lower level design element. Decomposing and allocating starts at the system \nlevel, where requirements derive directly from mission needs, and proceeds through \nsegment, subsystem, and component design levels. This process must also ensure \nclosure at the next higher level. Closure means that satisfying lower-level require-\nments ensures performance at the next higher level, and that we can trace all \nrequirements back to satisfying mission needs. This emphasizes the iterative character \nof the requirements development process. \n\n4.2 Requirements Analysis and Performance Budgeting 81 \n\nFigure 4-4 shows how a single mission need-the FJreSat geopositioning error-\nflows through ~y levels of design. Errors in the final mission data depend on many \nsodaurces of error m the processing segments for space, mission control, and mission \n\nta. , \n\nRg. 4-4. Allocation from MIssion Requirements through Component Design. UnderStand-\nIng the sources contributing to top-level requirements Is essential. \n\nTwo important observations are necessmy. Frrst, the system encompasses more \nthan the spacecraft, and errors come from numerous segments. The accuracy of the \ngeolocated object in a FJreSat image is driven by much more than the spacecraft's \n\n\n\n82 Requirements DefiDition 4.2 \n\npointing capability. Second, while the,number of error sources is large, they are not \nall equal. Many are predictable and relatively constant-star catalogs and Earth \nellipsoid estimates. Others are more variable, but small and not significant drivers for \ncost or technology. The remaining errors are those which are most amenable to \ncost-performance-risk trade-offs and need the greatest level of attention during \nrequirements flowdown and validation. \n\n4~1 Functional Analysis \n\nThe simplest way to represent functiOllS-QI' actions by or within each element of \na system-is through a functional-flow block diagram. As Fig. 4-5 shows, we define \nthe topmost or first level functions of a system in the sequence in which they occur. \nSuccessive decomposition permits identifying how a system works at each level \nbefore proceeding to lower levels. For example, to address sensor misalignment three \nlevels down in the functional flow (Function 4.4.4 in Fig. 4-5), it is necessary to \nconsider the production (1.0) and integration (2.0) phases, which require manufacture \nand validation within reasonable tolerances. \n\n4.4.3 \nEsIlmaIa \n~ \nSensor PDlntlng \n\nAngle \n\nTOP \nLEVEL \nFLOW \n\nSECOND \nLEVEL \n\n-- EsIlmaIa ConvertID THIRD ~\"7 ~4 InmIfaI Forest UdIIong & LEVEL fire LocaJ Map CoordInaIes CoordInaIes \n\nFIg. 4-5. Functional Flows Generating GeoposlUonlng Information for FlreSat Mission. \nThe functional flow defines what Is to be done In a hierarchical framework. Additional \nfeatures can be added to the representation (e.g., data Interfaces, control sequences) \nusing different diagramming techniques. \n\n4.2 Requirements Analysis and Performance Budgeting 83 \n\nOnce we establish the top-level functions and sequences, we can decompose and \nanalyze each function throughout the remaining layers of the flow. For example, \ndetermining geopositioning data (Function 4.4 in Fig. 4-5) for FrreSat requires- a \nsequence of actions, from estimating key spacecraft and payload parameters to deriv-\ning local Earth coordinates. Functional decomposition, regardless of how formalized, \nis neceSsary .in allocating design c~cteristics at each level of system architecture \n(the organization of system elements into a structured hierarchy). This organization \npermits us to allocate performance budgets together with other budgets affecting cost \nand risk. \n\nWe can also use functional flow diagrams to depict information or data flow, as \nwell as control gates governing function sequencing. Information may include inter-\nface data flowing between functions, control relationships showing what must happen \nbefore another function can begin, or data sources and destinations. \n\nIn applying these techniques, we may use manual methods, particularly for simple \nsystems, for top-level mission descriptions, but CASE (computer-aided system engi-\nneering) tools facilitate diagramming decompositions and maintaining traceability. \nBut as with other computer applications, the software for developing diagrams and \nmaintaining support databases does not drive the analysis. In fact, the functional \nframework which evolves is often a compromise among estimates of performance, \ncost, schedule, and the risk associated with each decision. (McClure [1988] and \nINCOSE Sixth Annual Proceedings [1996] provides an interesting discussion of sup-\nport tools and techniques.) \n\n4.2.2 Initial Performance Budgets \nAnalyzing requirements leads eventually to hierarchically organized performance \n\nmetrics and budgets for the interactive development segments. The iterative process \nstarts with budgets derived using analysis, simulation, known design or test data, and \na large measure of experience. We should note that in the development of require-\nments and derived functions, mission drivers must be the primary drivers. \n\nExperience or related reference missions are especially important in developing the \ninitial performance budgets to meet system performance requirements. In the example \nof Fig. 4-5, the geopositioning accuracy reflects this. The major trade-offs and focus \nfor validating performance therefore reside in how accurately the system can estimate \nand control position and attitude, and we must evaluate the options considered against \nnot only performance requirements but alsO cost and schedule. \n\nFigure 4-6 illustrates the combined effect of spacecraft attitude and position errors \non the geopositioning estimate's accuracy in locating fires. In this simple example, \nthree broad options are possible. The first option gives a very loose spacecraft position \nbudget, which permits only limited support from the GPS and/or remote tracking sta-\ntions. However, it requires a tight attitude budget, which is likely to create problems \nfor both the space and mission control segments. Though payload sensitivity and \nresolution drive the selection of the FrreSat orbit envelope, using a low-Earth orbit \ncould severely affect attitude accuracy because of atmospheric drag. A higher altitude \nwould reduce drag, but produce even tighter pointing tolerances. Thus, two main costs \nmake this a poor budget option: the satellite's subsystem for controlling attitude and \nthe potentially taxing calibration which the mission control segment must perform on \nthe attitude sensors. \n\nAt the other ex\u00b7treme, leaving the attitude budget loose and tightly estimating space-\ncraft position can have risks if a full GPS constellation is not in operation.

Typical Options In Error Budgets for Attitude and PoslOon. Variations in attitude \nand ephemeris accuracy requirements have implications on aDocation and attendant \ndesign risk. A balance of cost, performance, and implementation risk must enter the \nevaluation of options. Detans of mapping budget development are given in Sec. 5.4. \n\nris~ degraded perfonnance without a full constellation. Resorting to remote tracking \nstations or other sources of infonnation can require excessive response times. A third \noption allows some risk for both attitude and position error budgets, but balances that \nrisk against the cost of achieving the required geopositioning accuracy. \n\nTable 4-2 lists the elements we would nonnally budget with the chapter and para-\ngraph where we discuss each element. Budgeted items may come directly from \nrequirements such as geolocation or timing, or they may be related to elements of the \noverall system design such as subsystem weight, power, or propellant. \n\nTimeline budgets at the system level are also typical mission drivers. For FireSat, \n~~t timelines for tip-off response and data distribution will require developing an \nImtial budget. We must define and decompose all functions necessary to meet this \ntimeline, as well as define their allocation and control sequences (functions which can-\nnot start without completion of others and potential data hand-offs). Simulation will \nhelp us estimate delays in processing and communication. Applying experience or \n~ from related systems provides some calibration. But this initial budget is just that, \nsmce as the design process progresses, we will introduce changes from design itera-\ntions among different levels. \n\nIt is, however, extremely important to recognize the nature of initial design budgets. \nThey are typically developed by system engineers with a broad understanding of the \n\n4.2 Requirements Analysis and Performance Budgeting 85 \n\nTABLE 4-2. Elements FrequenUy Budgeted In Space Mission DesIgn. Primary budgets are \ndlrectiy related to mission requirements or ability to achieve the mission (e.g., \nweight).

But the details of new technology and lower-level design \nstudies can and should result in adjustments to these budgets as experts familiar with \nspecific subsystem and component design review t1!e initial allocations. A key aspect \nof the system design is a robust initial allocation (i.e., one which can tolerate changes \nat subsequently lower design levels) and adaptable to iterations as noted previously.' \nJust as it is important to involve representatives of all affected levels of design in the \ndevelopment of the initial budgets. it is also important to recognize the iterative nature \nand that a system solution which minimizes total cost and risk may impose more \nstringent demands on certain aspects of lower-level designs than others. The process \nof reconciling the imposed costs and allocated risks involves a high degree of \nnegotiation. \n\nTable 4-3 shows how the response timeline may affect the space and ground \nsegments of the system. While it may seem desirable to assign responsibility for a \nspecified perfonnance parameter to a single segment, we must evaluate and integrate \ncritical system parameters across segments. For example, F1reSat must respond \nquickly to tip-offs in order to provide the user timely data on suspected fires. This sin-\ngle response requirement alone may define the size and orbit envelope of the satellite \nconstellation to ensure coverage when needed. Thus, time budgets for the following \nchain of events will be critical to the mission control segment's performance: \n\n\u2022 Fonnulating the schedule for pass & time intervals \n\n\u2022 Developing and scheduling commands to the spacecraft \n\n\u2022 Developing.and checking constraints on the command load \n\n\u2022 Establishing communications with the spacecraft \n\n\n\n86 Requirements Definidon 4.2 \n\nTABLE 4-3.

Mis-\nsion data processing must receive, store, and process the mission data, sort it by user \nor by required media, and send it to the user. We must consider all of these activities \nin establishing budgets to meet the system requirement of delivering specified data and \nformat within 30 min of acquiring it. \n\nRequirements Budget Allocation Example \n. Poin~g budget development, described in Sec. 5.4, is a problem on space missions \n\nusmg pomtable sensors. Another common budget example is the timing delay associ-\nated with getting mission data to end users. It can be a critical requirement for system \ndesign, as is the case of detecting booster plume signatures 8ssoclated with ballistic \nmissile launches. In that case, coverage (i.e., the time from initiation of a launch to \ninitial detection) as well as the subsequent transmission, processing, distribution, and \ninterpretation of the detection, is time critical. Because of the severe coverage require-\nment, geosynchronous satellites with sensitive payloads and rapid processing are \nneeded. \n\nThe FrreSat mission does not require timing nearly as critical as missile detection, \nbut clearly the detection of forest fires is a time-sensitive problem. Figure 4-7 shows \nboth the timeline and the requirements budget associated with it. For FrreSat's Earth \ncoverage (i.e., Tune Segment 1), it would be ideal to provide continuous surveillance \nusing a geosynchronous satellite. However, cost and groUnd resolution favor a low-\nEarth orbit implementation which results in Tune Segment 1 being three to six hours, \ndepending principally on the number of satellites in the constellation. \n\nOnce detection occurs, a series of shorter timeline events must occur to achieve the \n30-minute requirement for Tune Segment 2. The system may need to validate each \ndetection to minimize the number of false alarms transmitted to the ground for \nprocessing. This may impose design specifications for onboard detection processing \nand additional payload \"looks.\" The time spent downlinking the data after validating \na detection could have a significant impact on the communications architecture that \nassures rapid acquisition of the required links.

Mission Data TImellne and Requirements Budget The actual time from the detec-\ntion of a fire to distribution of the time-urgent data Is related both to coverage and' \nspecific timing requirements. \n\n, \nto meet this timeline is a sigmticant cost driver, potentially replacing a \"store and \ndump\" approach appropriate for purely scientific missions. \n\nOnce the ground sy~tem receives the data it must process the data to format it, \nperform orbit, altitude, and ground-look-point determination, and then extract the rel-\nevant fire-detection data. A short time requirement here will likely demand real-time \nprocessing and a substantial capacity to support real-time operation. Identification and \ns~ent confirmation of a fire prior to broader dissemination may drive either a \nbigh. perf~ce pattern-matching process or manual processing in a time-critical \nf~~on. ~ce the ~ confirms a fire, the data must be registered and prepared for \ndistribution to appropriate end users. This preparation may involve merging it with \n\n\n\n88 Requirements Definition 4.2 \n\nstandard data sets to support evaluating the fire at a later time. The data processing \nsystem must also queue the data for distribution over a network. Priorities and proto-\ncols may drive the management of input queues and network routing. Figure 4-7 \nshows the initial allocations for the components of rune Segment 2. \n\nThis example punctuates two critical activities: FIrSt, the components of a timeline \nmust follow the step-by-step functional flow described in 42.1. The functions them-\nselves may be strictly sequential or capable of being processed in parallel to shorten \ntimelines. Functional representation diagrams and support tools (e.g., built-in simula-\ntion) can ease this evaluation. Second, there are numerous performance-cost trade-offs \nat each decision point which dictate the time-budget allocations. The objective is to \nmeet the highest level requirement while equally sharing the potential performance \nrisk and cost associated with meeting each derived requirement \n\n4.2.3 Refining and Negotiating the Performance Budgets \n\nSystem engineers must thoroughly understand how to develop and define require-\nments, then allocate and negotiate budgets associated with them. Failure to meet key \nbudgets can lead to major system problems. Early definition permits the iterative \nprocess of adjusting allocations, margins and even operations well before major cost \nor schedule penalties occur. \n\nPerformance budgeting and validating key system requirements is the iterative \nprocess, as shown in Fig. 4-8. Before the process can actually start, however, the \nspecific performance parameter and associated requirement statement must be clear \nand traceable to the mission need. The Quality Function Deployment methodology \nand several tools make this possible by maintaining the link between the need and the \ntechnical requirement in traceable documentation. Vague, inconsistent, or unquantifi-\nable requirements too often lead to inaccurate understanding, misinterpretation andlor \nexploitation. This applies especially to critical areas of system performance which \nwithout early and thorough interaction andlorprototype testing can become expensive \nand program-threatening later. We should also note that the iterative process includes \nnegotiation and re-negotiation of budgets based upon evidence from the design pr0-\ncess and the discovery of errors and \"injustices\" in the initial allocation. \n\nWe know of several programs in which major difficulties have resulted from con-\nflict among requirements. One case involved the difference between operational \navailability of ground stations with that of the satellites in a system. Another involved \nthe selection of the launch vehicle before a design concept was established, the re-\nquirements for the latter driving the mass far beyond the booster's lift capability. And \nin a third case, the changes in a customer's program management introduced new \nrequirements for a payload which invalidated the flowdown of the original project \nrequirements. The response to this required both data and persuasiveness, the latter \nbeing unfortunately insufficient until serious problems arose in the systems design. \n\nAn aside is worthwhile at this point on the issue of requirements-level vs. design-\nlevel budgeting. The system-level design is a logical integration or synthesis of \nsegment designs. Defining functions and their performance requirements and those \ninterfaces requiring support lays the framework for deciding ''how\" to design each \nsegment For FJreSat, this relates to the accuracy of the geolocation and the allocation \nto segments of ephemeris, attitude, and other contributions. The \"how\" relates to space \nsegment hardware decisions such as whether to use star sensor or gyro performance to \nachieve the required attitude accuracy. But such decisions affect mission operations \nwhich must then schedule star sensor calibration and gyro alignment so the spacecraft \n\nRequirements Analysis and Performance Budgeting \n\nSystem Perlormance Parameter & _ \n\nRequIrement Language \n\nSystem Concept \n\n+ System VaJJdatlon ProgramITestbed \nSystem \n\n\"Sbawman\" AIIocaIIon \n\n~ \nAnalysIs \n\nSegment \nPrototype Results \n\nSegment DesIgn I SegmeJ d Response \nBudget Analyses \n\nCYCLEf \nNegotiation \n\nConcurrence on Changes \n\nSystem-level \nValldallon Testing \n\nCYCLE2 \n\n~ ....

The initial performance budget is \n\na point of departure for later evaluation of segment design and validation testing. The \ndesign wiil converge to a validated value which may require system-level budget \nadjustments to match the changes. \n\ncan meet its requirements. Thus, both procedural and data interfaces must be identified \nand documented. In addition, mission operations must take into account the space-\ncraft's system for attitude control to keep from misusing it when scheduling \noperations. Likewise, in scheduling calibration or alignment, the mission operators \nmust know the sensor payload and other electronic package performance character-\nistics to prevent accidental maneuvers. System and segment specifications provide \nsystem and interface requirements, and lower-level specifications Provide design \nrequirements, but in fact, the l!ystem engineer and segment designers must interact at \nall design levels. \n\nIt should be noted that initial budget estimates almost never correspond with design \nconsiderations at lower levels. Clearly, the early budgets are starting points for \nnegotiation and budget adjustment, to reconcile early system allocations with segment \nestimates of design and performance. As we reconcile requirements, we should docu-\nment them in a requirements reference which changes only with full traceability and. \nvisibility for all stakeholders such as segment designers, system engineers, and pr0-\ngram managers. (A number of tools may be useful: these include the previously noted \nQFDs, plus software packages ranging from Excel to QSS DOORS and Ascent \nLogic's RDI) 100.) Each of these critical performance parameters matches an estab-\nlished system and segment budget. These budgets can and normally do change as \ndevelopers proceed on the design and validate performance. \n\n\n\n90 Requirements DefiDition 4.3 \n\nAt this stage of budgeting, design margin becomes an issue; specifically, how much \nis reasonable to keep, who knows where it is, and who has the authority to adjust it? \nTypically, margin is statistical (e.g., two-sigma error requirements), so as it cascades \nto various levels of design it can produce significant overdesign and cost. Design \nengineers can complicate appropriate adjustment by keeping margin at lower tiers of \ndesign, where it tends not to be visible or usable for reallocation. Here prescription \ncannot substitute for judgment. Sometimes, margins can provide robustness against \non-orbit failures, but can also cause problems. For example, too much margin in com-\nmunication links could actually saturate receivers. Key system requirements must also \nhave margins, which we can trade or allocate downward, so as to permit meeting real-\nistic performance and reliability with minimum risk. \n\nOnce the first cycle of interactions between system and segments personnel has \nestablished the best controlled estimate of key performance budgets we must continue \nto test the design we are developing. Configurations should be validated via simula-\ntions or prototypes. These early exercises in system integration are important in \ndeveloping a consensus that continues through the initial design phase. \n\nAt all times a baseline of common requirements must support this process of \nanalyzing and estimating performance requirements, interacting and negotiating with \nsegment implementors, and validating the key performance drivers early in the design \nphase. The validation exercises use many specific scenarios or point situations to \nevaluate performance. Meeting performance budgets in these point situations is \ncomforting, but not sufficient. Scenarios designed to stress one aspect of system \nperformance may not provide adequate coverage of other aspects. The converging, \ncontrolled system requirements captured in ~uirements documents, iDterfaces, and \nstandards are often the only reference for system functions and performance. The \nrequirements documentation must match the phase of system development in matur-\nity, but it must always reflect the results of analyses, performance budget negotiations, \nmid validation exercises-faithfully, openly, and quickly. \n\n4.3 Requirements Documentation and Specifications \n\nIn dealing with criteria for requirements documents, we should note the references \ngoverning much of today's systems engineering practice in the aerospace industry. \nWith the deletion of most military standards in the United States as contractual \nrequirements, internal documents most often establish and govern system design and \nengineering practices. These documents, however, are based largely upon either the \npreviously controlling MIL-STD-499 or its successor (not issued but availlj.ble in final \ndraft) 499b, or newer civil organization standards. These include the Electronics \nIndustries Association (in conjunction. with the International Council on Systems \nEngineering) EIAJIS 632, Systems Engineering and the Institute of Electrical and \nElectronic Engineering (IEEE) Trial Use standard, and Applicati,on and Management \noflhe Systems Engineering Process, IEEE 1220. Most recently, the International Stan-\ndards Organization (ISO) moved to incorporate systems engineering in the growing \nbody of international standards and to develop ISO Standard 15288, System Life \nCycle Processes, which can serve as a framework for activities in the increasingly \nglobal context of the aerospace industry. All of these documents place mission and \nrequirements development and management at the head of system design processes. \n\nEffective requirements documents must be consistent and complete relative to the \nmaturity of the system in its development cycle. Consistency means that we should \n\n4.3 Requirements Documentation and Specifications 91 \n\nwrite a performance requirement only once, keep it in a logical place, and position it \nappropriately in the hierarchy of established requirements. Completeness depends on \nthe system's phase of development, but it means that at every level of requirement we \nmust ensure that we satisfy the next higher level. As an example of completeness, the \ngeolocation requirement of the FrreSat mission should address all error sources both \nin segment and interface documents. \n\nRequirements Traceability \nRequirements must be rigorously traceable as we develop, allocate and decompose \n\nor derive them. While computer support tools exist which link and show dependencies \nand derivations among requirements, the complexity of the product should govern the \nform of the documentation. This form can range from notebooks for small projects to \n. sophisticated database systems. We must base every design and decision task on \nrequirements, and trade studies at any level must.take into account all related require-\nments, while considering the impact of changes throughout the product (and system) \narchitecture. Any indexing method will suffice, so long as it permits traceability \nupwards as well as across all elements. Requirements documents should specify this \ntracing method, however, and the basis for derived requirements must be clearly iden-\ntifiable. The specific requirements document may be purely electronic, possibly using \nthe database features of the computer tools. Whatever the documentation form, it must \nhave a concise entry for every requirement. Each entry should index the documents \nand specific paragraphs from which we traced the requirement. Where analysis pr0-\nduced a derived requirement, it should reference the specific technical memo or report \nshowing the results of the analysis for future use. \n\nTraceability emphasizes the need for effective requirements to be unambiguous and \nverifiable to avoid misinterpretation and exploitation. Words such as \"optimize\" or \n\"minimize\" in specifications cannot govern the design, and they defy verification. \n\nWe should note that requirements reviews are necessary corollaries to design \nreviews and issues must have the same weight as design issues in readiness decisions \nby a program to proceed to its next step of development. We sometimes call these \n\"gates.\" Requirements assessments at such review points are critical. They may iden-\ntify the need to reassess project drivers, including: . \n\n\u2022 Accelerate or emphasize particular design areas \n\n\u2022 Relax design budgets \n\n\u2022 Reallocate requirements \n\n\u2022 Consider operational work-arounds \n\n\u2022 Acknowledge a program slip \n\n\u2022 Revise funding profiles \n\nRequireJpents documentation notionally falls into nine classes (Fig. 4-9). These are \noften designated as specifications. The figure w.so shows descriptive or supporting \ndocuments which need to be current with the requirements baseline. \n\nBased on mission needs, analyses, and validation exercises, the system require-\nments document (usually called \"system requirements specification\") should cover \nevery relevant aspect of what the system should do (functions) and how well it should \ndo it (performance requirements). It should address every aspect of system perfor-\nmance. Since ideally system requirements are the basis for segment requirements, they \n\n\n\nRequirements De6oitiOD 4.3 \n\nDescriptIve & Supporting \nDocumen!a \n\n\u2022 Requirements speclllcatiOIiS \n\nFIg. 4-9. Requirements DocumentaUon Hierarchy or System Specfflcatlon. \n\nshould come before the latter. However, once segments are defined. there may be \ntrade-Of!s ~ at the system level in response to cost, interface issues, perfor-\nmance limitations, or.schedules related to segment designs. \n\nWe should note that among the system plans derived from requirements are test \nplans which will reflect validation and verification of these requirements in qualifiCa-\ntion and acceptance processes. These characteristically are reflections from test spec_ \nifications which identify objectives, environments and levels of assembly at which \ntests are to be performed. \n\nIt should be remembered that requirements specifications, at system and lower \nl~v~ls, are p?tentiall>: subject to change. The~fore, they should be designated, \"pre-\n111Dl~ary\" poor to reVIews at each stage of destgn. During formal design phases, while \nreqwrements may have to be traded, the specifications must, like design documents \nbe subject to rigorous change control. ' \n\nIn addition, when requirements specifications at a top level govern more than one \nsystem segment, tailoring to accommodate the specific character of a segment may be \nappropriate. This is particularly so with requirements not directly associated with \nsystem performance. \n\nInterface Management \nOften, developers overlook or assume external interfaces in the early stages of \n\nsystem development, but they must be carefully considered With the total system \narchitecture. Internal to the system, documenting interfaces between segments, usually \nthrough interface control documents or leDs, is the key to integrating and maintaining \nrelationships between these segments. The system level ICD may be referred to or \nincluded in the system specification. Documents covering critical interfaces, such as \nthe spacecraft-to-ground segment for FrreSat, can become highly complex. Two \nguidelines are important in developing and refining interface documents. Each docu-\nment normally covers only two segments, although multiple elements within segments \nmay require consideration of relationships with other segments. In general, we should \navoid designs necessitating such added complexity. \n\n4.4 Summary: The Steps to a RequJrements Baseline 93 \n\nIn all cases, we must document these agreements at every level of design, usually \nin ICDs. At the system level, project managers or system engineers control these, \nwhile internal to segments, this is the responsibility of individual element leaders (see \nChap. 16). Although the content and format of interface documents vary significantly \nwith products and organizations, elements always addressed include physical and data \nor signal interfaces and interactions. Thus pin connections and message formats \nclearly must be defined in interface documents; but the characteristics of gyro drift and \nstar sensor performance (such as nonIinearities of the transfer function, output axis \ncoupling or star sensor noise) require the same definition level so that the mission \nground station can correctly calibrate them. \n\n4.4 Summary: The Steps to a Requirements BaseHne \n\nWe have commented that we cannot prescribe a single means for establishing \nrequirements. This chapter does, however, present guidelines for establishing a \nrequirements baseline in approximately sequential order. This baseline is a reference \nnot only for establishing the premises for functional design, but also a means of \ncontinually assessing the impact of design decisions on requirements validation. We \ncan predetermine some requirements, such as constraints on a system. (One example \ncould be the requirement to use existing NASA ground facilities.) We must recognize \nthat requirements can and do change and that flexibility in the design process is \nnecessary to accommodate such change, as in the need to iterate the relationships \namong design, functions and requirements. Documentation is also a critical aspect of \nthe requirements process, for sustaining the baseline reference, as well as providing \nthe translation for system development of the mission objectives. \n\nTABLE 4-4. Steps to Developing a Requirements Baseline. \n\n1. Identify the customer and user of the product or services. A customer may be a procuring \nagent but not the ultimate user and both must be understood. \n\n2. Identify and prioritize customer/user objectives and needs for the mission to be \naccomplished. \n\n3. Define internal and external constraints. \n\n4. Translate customer/user needs Into functional attributes and system characteristics. \n.Quallty Function Deployment Is one tool to do this. \n\n5. Establish functional requirements for system and provide for decomposition to elements. \n\n6. Establish functional flow and representative for its performance of functions. \n\n7. Translate functional attributes Into technical characteristics which will become the \nrequirements for the physical system. \n\n8. EstabDsh quantifiable reqUirements from all the above steps. \n\n9. Through the use of block diagrams expressing Interfaces and hardwarelsoftware/data \nrelationships for the system level. \n\n10. From the architecture expressed by step 9 at the system level, decompose the functional \nrequirements and characteristics sets to successive lower levels, I.e., the next level \ndefining the basis of the elements of the system. \n\n11. At all the ~ps above, iteration with preceding activities Is necessary both to test the \nassumptions made and to reconcile higher levels of requirements and functional \nImplementation. \n\n\n\n94 Requirements DefiDition 4.4 \n\nIn the steps which relate to determining requirements, every requirement must have \nat least the following three components: first, ''what\" the system is to do (the function); \nsecond, ''how well\" it is to perform the function (performance requirement); last, how \nwe verify the requirement (verification). This last component should be of particular \nconcern to us early in the requirements develQpment Process, and we should translate \nit into a verification and validation plan which will govern the quality and quaIification \ntest programs. . \n\nTable 4-4 lists ten steps to establishing a requirements baseline in the early phase \nof a development program. It emphasizes activities concerned with analyzing and \nvalidating system requirements versus the design of segments, subsystems, or compo-\nnents. These activities produce a hierarchical baseline of requirements which lead to \nallocation throughout a decomposed system. \n\nReferences \n\nBlanchard, B. and W. Fabrycky. 1990.

This type of analysis deals predominantly, though \nnot entirely, with directions-only geometry. We want to know how to point the space-\ncraft or instrument, or how to interpret the view of a spacecraft camera or antenna \npattern. Two formal mechanisms for dealing with directions-only geometry are unit \nvectors and the celestial sphere. Unit vectors are more common in most areas of \nanalysis. However, the celestial sphere provides greatly improved physical insight \nwhich can be critical to the space mission designer. Consequently, we first introduce \nthe basic concept of using the celestial sphere for directions-only geometry and then \napply the concept to space mission geometry as seen from either the Earth or the space-\ncraft. Finally, we develop a methodology for dmwing up spacecraft maPPing and \npointing budgets. \n\nTo begin any formal problem in space mission geometry, we must first select a \ncoordinate system. In principle, any coordinate system will do. In practice, selecting \nthe right one can increase insight into the problem and substantially reduce the \nprospect for errors. The most common source of error in space geometry analyses is \nincorrectly defining the coordinate systems involved. \n\nTo define a coordinate system for space applications, we must first specify two \ncharacteristics: the location of the center and what the coordinate system is fixed with \nrespect to. Typically, we choose the Earth's center as the coordinate system center for \nproblems in orbit analysis or geometry on the Earth's surface; we choose tOe \nspacecraft's position for problems concerning the apparent position and motion of \nobjects as seen from the spacecraft. Occasionally, coordinates are centered on a \nspecific spacecraft instrument when we are interested not only in viewing the outside \nworld but also in obstructions to the field of view by other spacecraft components. \nTypical ways to fix a coordinate system are with respect to inertial space, to tlle \ndirection of the Earth or some other object being viewed, to the spacecraft, or to an \ninstrument on the spacecraft. Table 5-1 lists the most common coordinate systems in \n\n95 \n\n\n\n96 Space Mission Geometry \n\nspace mission analysis and their applications. These are illustrated in Fig. 5-1.

Celestial coordinates are defined by the direction \nin space of the Earth's pole, called the celestial pole, and the direction from the Earth \nto the Sun on the first day of spring, when the Sun crosses the Earth's equatorial plane \ngoing from south to north. This fundamental reference direction in the sky is known \nas the vernal equinox or First Point of Aries. * Unfortunately for mission geometry, the \nEarth's axis and, therefore, the vernal equinox precesses around the pole of the Earth's \norbit about the Sun with a period of 26,000 years.

It comes from classical observational astronomy \nand is far older than almost any other modern astronomical concept. The compelling \nimage of the bowl of the sky at night makes it easy to think of stars and planets moving \non a fixed, distant sphere. We now know, of course, that their distances from us are \nvastly different. But the concept of watching and computing the position and motion \nof things on the unit celestial sphere remains a very valuable contribution of classical \nastronomy to modern spaceflight analysis. Unfortunately, relatively few modern \nreferences are available. By far, the most detailed treatment is provided by Wertz \n[2001]. Green [1985], and Smart [1977] provide information on spherical astronomy. \n\nFigure 5-3 illustrates the use of the celestial sphere to represent directions to objects \nin space. These objects may be very close, such as other components of the spacecraft, \n\n5.1 Introduction to Geometry on the Celestial Sphere 99 \n\nor very far, such as the surface of the Earth, the Sun, or stars. Although we will drop \nthe observer from illustrations after the first few figures, we always assume that the \nobserver is at the center of the sphere. Having become familiar with the idea of the \nobserver-centered celestial sphere, we can easily work with points and lines on the \nsphere itself, ignoring entirely the unit vectors which they represent \n\n.B = Sun Angle \n71 = Nadlr Angle \n\nRg. 5-3. Use of Celestial Sphere to Represent DIrection of ObJects In Space. The sides of \nthe triangle are arc lengths. The angles of the triangle are rotation angles. \n\nPoints on the celestial sphere represent directions in space, such as the direction to \nthe Sun, the Moon, or a spacecraft axis. The direction opposite a given direction is \ncalled the antipode, or antipoint, and frequently has a \"-I\" superscript. Thus, S-l is \nthe direction opposite the Sun, and is called the antisolar point. Nadir is the direction \nto the center of the Earth. The direction opposite nadir is called the zenith. Points on \nthe sphere may represent either directions to real objects or simply directions in space \nwith no object associated with them, such as the direction parallel to the axis of the \nEarth (the celestial pole) or para1lel to the +Z-axis of a spacecraft coordinate system. \n\nA great circle on the celestial sphere is any circle which divides the sphere into two \nequal hemispheres, Any other circle on the sphere is called a small circle. Any part of \na great circle is called an arc or arc segment and is equivalent to a straight line segment \nin plane geometry. Thus, the shortest path connecting two stars on the celestial sphere \nis the great circle arc connecting the stars. Two points which are not antipoints of each \nother determine a unique great circle arc on the celestial sphere. \n\nGiven 3 points on the sky, we can connect them with great circle arc segments (If!, \n11, and fJ on Fig. 5-3) to construct a spherical triangle. The angles A. 1; and f/I at the \nvertices of the spherical triangle are called rotation angles or dihedral angles. The \nlengths of arc segments and size of rotation angles are both measured in degrees. How-\never, as illustrated in Fig. 5-4, these are distinctly different measurements. The arc \nlength represents the side of the spherical triangle, and is equal to the angular separa-\ntion between 2 points seen on the sky. The rotation angle, which is always measured \nabout a point on the sphere, represents the angle in a spherical triangle, and is equal to \nthe dihedral angle between 2 planes. For example, assume that we see the Earth, \n\n\n\n100 Space Mission Geometry \n\nA.

The arc length between the Sun and the Moon \nis the angular separation between them as measured by the observer. The rotation \nangle about the Earth between the Sun and the Moon is equal to the angle between 2 \nplanes. The observer, Earth, and Sun form the first plane, and the observer, Earth, and \nMoon form the second. Both types of angles are important in mission geometry \nproblems, and we must clearly understand the distinction between them. Table 5-2 \nlists the properties of these two basic measurement types. \n\nAs shown in Fig. 5-5, the +X-axis is normally toward the reference point on the \nequator, and the +Z-axis is toward the positive or North Pole. The great circles through \nthe poles and perpendicular to the equator are called meridians. The meridian through \nany point on the sphere determines the azimuth coordinate of that point Azimuth is the \nequivalent of longitude on the Earth's surface, and is measured along the equator. The \nazimuth is also equivalent to the rotation angle measured counterclockwise about the \npole from the reference point to the point in question. The second coordinate which \ndetermines the position of any point on the sphere is the elevation or latitude compo-\nnent It is the arc-length distance above or below the equator. The co-latitude or \nco-elevation is the arc length from the pole to the point in question. SmaIl circles at a \nconstant elevation are called parallels. Because a parallel of constant elevation is not \na great circle (except at the equator), the arc length along a pamllel will not be the same \nas the arc-length separation between two points. As Table 5-3 shows, several spherical \ncoordinate systems in common use have special names for the azimuth and elevation \ncoordinates. \n\nThe following equations transform the azimuth, Az, and elevation, El, to the corre-\nsponding unit vector coordinates (x, y, z): \n\nx = cos (Az) cos (El) \n\ny = sin (Az) cos (El) \n\nz=sin (El) \n\n(5-1a) \n\n(5-1b) \n\n(5-1c) \n\n5.1 Introduction to Geometry on the Celestial Sphere 101 \n\nTABLE 5-2.

All pairs of great circles \neither lie on top of each other or intersect at 2 points 180 deg apart \n\nAnother concept in spherical geometry that is different than plane geometry is \nillustrated in Fig_ 5-6, in which we have constructed a spherical triangle using the \nequator and two lines of longitude. The intersection of the longitude lines with the \nequator are both right angles. such that the sum of the angles of the triangle exceed \n180 deg by an amount equal to the angle at the pole. The sum of the angles of any \nspherical triangle is always larger than 180 deg. The amount by which this sum \nexceeds 180 deg is called the spherical excess and is directly proportional to the area \nof the spherical triangle. Thus, small triangles on the sphere have a spherical excess \nnear zero, and are very similar to plane triangles. Large spherical triangles, however, \nare very different as in Fig. 5-6 with 2 right angles. \n\nA radian is the angle subtended if I take a string equal in length to the mdius of a \ncircle, and stretch it along the circumference_ Similarly, if I take an area equal to the \nsquare of the mdius, and stretch it out on the surface of a sphere (which requires some \ndistortion, since the surface of the sphere cannot fit on a flat sheet), the resulting area \nis called a steradian. Since the area of a sphere is 4w2, there are 411: stemdians in a full \nsphere, and 211: stemdians in a hemisphere. These units are convenient for area prob-\nlems, becl}use in any spherical triangle, the spherical exce8$, expressed in mdians, is \nequal to the area of the triangle expressed in stemdians. In general, the area, A, of any \nspherical polygon (a figure with sides which are great circle arcs) expressed in stem-\ndians is given by: \n\nA =1: - (n-2)1I: (5-3) \n\nwhere n is the number of sides, and 1: is the sum of the rotation angles expressed in \nmdians. \n\n5.1 Introduction to Geometry on the Celestial Sphere 103 \n\nRg. 5-6. The Sum of the Angles In a Spherical Triangle Is Always Greater than 180 deg \u2022. \nThe amount by which the sum exceeds 180 deg Is called the spherical excess and Is \nproportional to the triangle area. \n\nFigure 5-7 shows a variety of spherical triangles. Note that all of the triangle sides \nare great circle arcs. Figure 5-7 A is a nearly plane triangle, for which the sum of the \nangles is approximately 180 deg and plane geometry is a close approximation. Figure \n5-7B is called a right spherical triangle because the angle at B is a right angle. Just as \nplane right triangles have particularly simple relationships among the angles and sides, \nright spherical triangles also have exceptionally simple relationships between the sides \nand angles. These are expressed by Napier's rules which are written out in Appen-\ndix D. Right spherical triangles are common in mission geometry problems, and \nprovide simple, straightforward solutions for many problems associated with angular \nmeasurements. \n\nThere is a second type of special and particularly simple spherical triangle shown \nin Fig. 5-7C. Here, side A-B has an arc length of 90 deg. This is called a quadrantal \nspherical triangle. An equally simple set of rules apply to the relationship among the \nangles and sides in quadmntal spherical triangles. These are also summarized in \nAppendix D. Between them, right and quadrantal spherical triangles provide solutions \nto most problems encountered in mission analysis. \n\nFigure 5-70 shows an obtuse isosceles triangle with two equal rotation angles \nlarger than 90 deg. Clearly, this cannot exist in plane geometry. A similar strange tri-\nangle for plane geometry is Fig. 5-7E which shows an equilateral right triangle in \nwhich all three angles and all three sides are 90 deg. This triangle represents 118 of the \nsurface of the celestial sphere, and has an area of 0.511: steradians, which. can be seen \neither by examination or from the spherical excess rule. Finally, Fig. 5-7F shows a \nvery large spherical triangle. Note that this triangle is remarkably similar in appear-\nance to the small triangle in 5-7 A. This is because the triangle can be thought of either \nas a small triangle with three angles of approximately 60 deg, or as a very large one, \nwith three angles of approximately 120 deg. That is, the area between A, B, and C can . \nbe thought of either as the inside of a small triangle or as the outside of a large one \nwhich covers all of the surface of the sphere except for the small area between A, B, \nand C. In this large spherical triangle, the rules of spherical geometry still apply and \ncan be used in very convenient fashions as described further in Wertz [2001]. \n\n\n\n104 Space Mission Geometry 5.1 \n\nA.

Types of Spherical Triangles. See text for discussion. \n\nIn plane geometry, we can make triangles larger or smaller and maintain the same \nrelative proportions. In spherical geometry, this is not the case. A spherical triangle is \nuniquely specified by either 3 sides or 3 rotation angles. Additional details on ele-\nmentary spherical geometry are in Appendix D, which includes references to several \nstandard bOoks. \n\nBecause spherical triangles approach plane triangles in the limit of small size and \nbecause most analysts are much more familiar with plane geometry, they tend to use \nplane geometry approximations even when it is entirely inappropriate. An example \nwould be a geometry problem dealing with the surface of the Earth as seen from \nnearby space. Figme 5-8 shows the differences between plane geometry and spherical \ngeometry, using the example of a right spherical triangle with one 45-deg rotation \nangle. Here both the length of the hypotenuse and the other rotation angle are a func-\ntion of the size of the triangle. For a spacecraft in geosynchronous orbit, the apparent \n~ radius is 8 . .1 deg and, from the figme, the differences between plane and spher-\nIcal geometry will be of the order of 0.1 deg. If this amount does not matter for a \nparticular problem, then the plane geometry approximation is fine. Otherwise, we \nshould use spherical geometry. In low-Earth orbit, the angular radius of the Earth is \n60 deg to 70 deg, so plane geometry techniques give not only incorrect numerical \nanswers but results which are conceptually wrong. Thus, we should avoid plane \ngeometry approximations for problems involving spacecraft in low-Earth orbits or \nnearly any type of precision pointing. \n\nWe will illustrate computations on the celestial sphere with two examples-the \nduration of eclipses in a circular low-Earth orbit, and the angle between any spacecraft \n\n5.1 Introdnction to Geometry on the Celestial Sphere \n\nSldeX SldeY \n(deg) (deg) \n\n1 1.00 \n10 9.85 \n30 26.6 \n60 41 \n90 45 \n\n120 41 \n150 27 \n170 10 \n\n185 \n\nAngle A \n(deg) \n45.01 \n45.86 \n52.02 \n\n69 \n90 \n111 \n128 \n134 \n\nFig. 5-8.

In both cases, once we choose the correct coordinate system, we can \neasily develop exact formulas using spherical techniques. \n\nExample 1. Analyzing Eclipses for a Low-Earth Orbit \n\nThe first example is a satellite in a circular low-Earth orbit at altitude H = 1 000 kID \nand inclination i = 32 deg. We wish to determine the eclipse fraction for any date and \nalso the maximum and minimum eclipses over a year. Figme 5-9 shows four different \nviews of the geometry of this problem. In Fig. 5-9A we have drawn the geometry in \nthe \"normal\" fashion, with a Cartesian coordinate system centered on the Earth and \nvec~ to the spacecraft and to the direction of the Sun. Although we could apply this \ncoordinate representation to our problem, it gives us no particular insight Also, to use \nthis coordinate representation without further analysis, we would have to simulate \nthe orbit and do a large number of trials to sample various eclipse durations throughout \nthe year. \n\nFigme 5-9B provides more information by plotting the system on the unit celestial \nsphere centered on the spacecraft. It shows the celestial equator, the orbit plane and \nthe ecliptic, which i$ the path of the Sun over the year. The light dashed circles ~ the \noutline of the disk of the Earth as seen by the spacecraft as the Earth's center moves \nalong the spacecraft orbit path. An eclipse will occur whenever the disk of the Earth \ncrosses in front of the Sun. The circle centered on the orbit pole is tangent to the disk \nof the Earth throughout the orbit Any object within this circle can be seen at all times \nand ~ not be eclipsed by the Earth. The ecliptic does not pass through this circle of \nno eclipse. Consequently, for the illustrated orbit, eclipses will occur at all times of the \ny~ with no eclipse-free season. That is, no time exists when an eclipse does not occur \ndurmg some part of the orbit (For the time being, we are ignoring the rotation of the \nsate~te's or?it du~ to various ~bing forces; This orbit rotation may make the \nDSSOCIatedantbmetic more complex; It does not change the basic argument) Although \n\n\n\n106 Space Mission Geometry 5.1 \n\nA. isometric View \n\nc.

AHernat/ve VIew of Satellite Geometry for a 1,1IOO-km, 32-deg IncOnation Orbit. \n\nwe have gained some additional insight from this figme, it would still be awkward to \ncompute the eclipse duration for any particular geometry. \n\nFigme 5-9C illustrates the same geometry in a celestial coordinate system centered \non the spacecraft, in which the orbit plane is the equator and we hold the direction to \nthe Earth fixed along the +X-axis. In this coordinate frame the Earth's disk is the fixed \nshaded circle. Because one axis is always facing the Earth, this coordinate frame \nrotates once per orbit in inertial space about the orbit pole. Thus any objects approxi-\nmately fixed in inertial space, such as the stars, Sun, or Moon, will appear to rotate \nonce per orbit about the orbit pole. The heavy, solid line shows a typical path of the \nSun in one orbit. Again, an eclipse will occur whenever the path of the Sun goes behind \nthe disk of the Earth. We now have enough insight to understand what is happening \nthroughout the year and to develop straightforward formulas for the eclipse fraction \nunder any conditions. \n\nIn anyone orbit, the Sun will move along a smaIl circle path and the duration of the \neclipse will be the fraction of the smaIl circle behind the disk of the Earth. For the orbit \nillustrated, the eclipse covers 113 deg of azimuth. Thus, the eclipse will last for \n113 deg/360 deg =32% of the orbit period or about 33 min for the 105 min, 1,000 km \n\n5.1 Introduction to Geometry on the Celestial Sphere 107 \n\norbit [see Eq. (7-7) for the orbit period]. As the Sun moves along the ecliptic through-\nout the year, it will move slowly up and down. on the globe plot. The angle of the Sun \nabove or below the orbit plane, Ps, goes from a maximum of 55 deg above the orbit \nplane to 55 deg below the plane. (55 deg is the sum of the assumed inclination of \n32 deg and the angle between the ecliptic and the Earth's equator of 23 deg). By \ninspeCtion, the maximum eclipse occurs when the Sun is in the orbit plane. It covers \n120 deg of azimuth or 35 min for this orbit. Again by inspection, we see that the \nminimum eclipse occurs when the Sun is at the upper or lower limit of its range. It \ncovers approximately 60 deg of azimuth. Thus an eclipse will occur on every orbit, \nwith a minimum eclipse duration of about half the maximum, or 17 min. However, we \ncan also see by inspection that eclipses near minimum duration will occur only when \nthe Sun is quite close to its extreme range limit. Most of the time, the eclipse duration \nWill be close to the maximum. Consequently, if we wish to assume an average eclipse \nfor analysis purposes, we should take a value close to the maximum eclipse rather than \none midway between the maximum and minimum values. \n\nThe geometry of Fig. 5-9C allows us easily to compute the eclipse fraction for any \ngiven Sun angle conditions. Specifically, Fig. 5-9D shows a quadrantal spherical \ntriangle (that is, having one side = 90 deg) between the orbit pole, nadir, and the point \nat which the Sun is on the Earth's horizon. Let p be the angular radius of the Earth, {Js \nbe the angle of the Sun above the orbit plane, and cP /2 be half of the rotation angle \ncorresponding to the eclipse duration. From the rules for quadrantal triangles (Appen-\ndix D) we find immediately that \n\ncos (CP 12) = cos pI sin f3s' = cos pI cos f3s (5-4a) \nThe duration of the eclipse in a circular orbit, TE\u2022 is then \n\nTE = P (CP /360 deg) (5-4b) \nwhere P is the orbit period from Eq. (7-7). \n\nFor our example, p = 60 deg, f3s has been chosen to be 25 deg, and, therefore, \n0= 113 deg and TE = 33 min as expected. Eq. (5-4) provides the eclipse fraction for \nany Sun geometry involving circular orbits and an approximate check for orbits which \nare not precisely circular. By adjusting p appropriately, we can use the same equation \nto determine the time the Sun will be a certain number of degrees above or below the \nEarth's horizon. This example shows how we develop physical insight and simple \nformulas by using global geometry to analyze mission geometry problems. \n\nExample2. S.un Angle Geometry \n\nWe can extend the straightforward computations of the preceding example to \ndetermine the angle of the Sun relative to any arbitrary face on the spacecraft as the \nspacecraft goes around in its orbit. This helps us analyze thermal effects and assess \npossible Sun interference in the fields of view of various instruments. \n\nWe assume the spacecraft is flying in a traditional orientation for Earth-referenced \nspacecraft with one axis pointed toward nadir and a second axis toward the orbit pole. \nThe computational geometry is in Fig. 5-10, which is geometrically identical to \nFig. 5-9. In this coordinate system, fixed on the spacecraft, the normal to a given \nspacecraft face is represented by a point, N, on the celestial sphere. N remains fixed in \nspacecraft coordinates, as does the orientation of nadir and the orbit pole.

If I is the incident energy on the face with area A, K is the solar \nconstant in the vicinity of the Earth = 1,367 W/ffil, and fJ is the angle between the Sun \nand the normal, N, to the face, then at any given moment when the Sun is shining on \nthe face: \n\n1= AK cos fJ (5-5) \nand, from the law of cosines for sides, \n\ncos fJ = cos r cos fJs' + sin r sin fJs' cos (Mz) (5-6) \nBy inspection, the maximum and minimum angles between the Sun and N are: \n\nfJII/Q% = fJs' + r and fJmin = 1 fJs' - rl (5-7) \nfJs' and r are both constants for a given orbit and spacecraft face, whereas Mz \nchanges throughout the orbit. \n\nFig. 5-10. Geometry for Computation of Sun Angle on an Arbitrary Spacecraft Face. N is \nthe unit vector or direction normal to the face. As the spacecraft moves in Its orbit, the \napparent position of the Sun moves along the dashed line and the arc length {J \nbetween the Sun and the normal to the face undergoes a sinusoidal oscillation. \n\nEquations (5-5) to (5-7) apply to either circular or elliptical orbits. If the orbit is \ncircular with period P and angular frequency w = 21t1P, then Eqs. (5-5) and (5-6) can \nbe integrated directly to determine the total energy, E, incident on the face between \nazimuths Azl and Az2: \n\nEAzl toAz2 = (AK/w) [(~-~) cos r cos fJi \n+ (sin Mz2 - sin Mzt) sin r sin fJi 1 (5-8) \n\nIn Eq. (5-8), the 0 azimuth is in the direction of N, and the angles are in mdians. In a \nfull orbit the Sun will shine on the face except for two periods: (A) during eclipse and \n(B) when fJ > 90 deg and, therefore, the Sun is on the ''back side\" of the face. From \nEq. (5-4a) the conditions for eclipse are \n\nAzeclipse = Azo \u00b1 arc cos (cos pI sin fJi ) (5-9) \n\n5.1 IntroductJon to Geometry on the Celestial Sphere \u00b0 109 \n\nwhere Azo is the azimuth of nadir relative to N. For condition (B) we use a quadrantal \ntriangle with fJ = 90 deg to determine \n\nAzback = \u00b1arccos [-lI(tan rtanfJS)] (5-10) \nThe problem now reduces to determining whether conditions (A) or (B) or both will \noccur and the relative order of the azimuth limits. \n\nAs an example, consider Figs. 5-9 and 5-10, for which P = 60 deg, w = 0.0010 \nmd/sec, and fJs= 25 deg.We assume the spacecraft face has an area of 05 m2 with its \nnormal vector at an azimuth of -75 deg from nadir (Azo= 75 deg) and an elevation of \n35 deg above the orbit plane (r= 55 deg). From Eqs. (5-8) and (5-9), the azimuth limits \nare: Azlecl~ = 185 deg, Azuclipse = 1315 deg, Azlback = 109.0 deg, and Azy,acIc = \n251.0 deg. \u00b0l'herefore, the total energy input on the face F over one orbit is between the \nazimuths of Azi = 251.0 deg and Az:z = 185 deg. \n\nExample 3. Sow Radiation Intensity \nWe can continue to extend our example to look at the average solar radiation input, lav on \n\nany spacecraft face over an orbit This is given by go \n\n(5-11) \n\nwhere, as before, A is the area of the face and K = 1,367 W 1m2 is the solar constant in the vicinity \nof the Earth. F is the time average fraction of the surface area projected in the direction of the \nSun and must lie between 0 and 1. If the attitude of the spacecraft is inertially fixed. then the \nangle, fJ, between the unit vector, S , in the direction of the Sun and the unit vector, ~ , normal \nto the face remains constant over an orbit If there is no eclipse during a given orbit. then \n\nF = ~ . S = cos P (inertially fixed. no eclipse) (5-12) \nwhich gives the same result as using Eq. (5-5) directly. \n\nFor a 3-axis-stabilized, nadir-oriented spacecraft in a circular orbit, the angle P will oscillate \nsinusoidally as illustrated previously in Fig. 5-10. The amount of sunlight on the face will de-\npend on both Yo the angle from the orbit normal to ~ ,and on Ps. the angle from the orbit normal \nto the Sun. If (y + Ps) 590 deg, then the face will always be in sunlight and, assuming no \neclipse: \n\nF = cos Y cos fJs (nadir fixed, full sunlight, no eclipse) (5-13a) \nIf Iy - Ps I ~ 90 deg, then the surface will always be shaded and, of course: \n\nF=O (nadir fixed. continuous shade) (5-13b) \n\nIf neither of the above conditions hold, then the face will be shaded part of the time and in \nsunlight part of the time. In this case, we integrate the instantaneous fraction of the surface area \nprojected in the direction of the Sun by the instantaneous Mz. starting and ending when fJ. the \nSun angle, is 90 deg. Dividing by 2n gives the average F over one orbit \n\n1 II., 1 II., \nF= - J cosp d(Mz) =- J[cosycosfJS +sinysinPS cos(Mz>1d(Mz) 2n 2n \n\n-II., -II., \n\n= (~cos ycos fJi + sin (f190 sin ysin Ps) In \n(nadir fixed. partial shade, no eclipse) \n\nwhere ~ is expressed in radians and \n\ncos ~ = -11 (tan y tan Pi> \n\n(5-13c) \n\n(5-14) \n\n\n\n110 Space Mission Geometry 5.2 \n\nThe quantity <1>00 is the value of Mz at which P = 90 deg, i.e., when the transition occurs \nbetween shade and sunlight \n\nConsider our previous example for which Ps' = 65 deg and Y= 55 deg. In this case, \nEq. (5-13c) is applicable and, from Eq. (5-14), d>oo = 109.1 deg. This means that the Sun will \nshine on the face in question whenever the azimuth of the Sun is within 109.1 deg of the azimuth \nof the face. From Eq. (5-13c), F = 0.370. This means that, without eclipses, the average sol8r \ninput on the face is 37.0% of what it would be if the Sun were continuously shining normaI to \nthe face. If the face in question has a surface area of 0.5 m2, then the average solar input over an \norbit with full sunlight is (0.5) (1 ;367) (0.370) = 253 W. ) \n\nThe nadir-oriented satellite above is spinning at one rotation per orbit in inertial space. Thus, \nall of the above formulas can be applied to spinning spacecraft with the interpretation that I \nis the average solar radiation input over one spin period, yis the angle from the spin axis to ~ \nface in question, and Ps'is the angle from the spin axis to the Sun. \n\nIn practice there are two principal corrections to the above formulas: \n\n\u2022 F is reduced by eclipses \n\n\u2022 The effective F is increased by reflected or emitted radiation from the Earth \n\nFor either an inertially fixed spacecraft or a spinning spacecraft, the effect of ecliPses is sim-\nply to reduce F by the fraction of the orbit over which the spacecraft is in eclipse: \n\nF= Po (1- iP1360 deg) (5-1S) \nwhere Po is the noneclipse value of F determin~ from Eqs. (5-12) or (5-13) and iPis the eclipse \nfraction from Eq. (5-4). \n\nFor Earth-oriented spacecraft the situation is more complex, because the solar input depends \non the orientation of the Sun relative to both the Earth and spacecraft face being evaluated. Let \n11 be the angular distance from ~ to nadir and p be the angular radius of the Earth. If the face in \nquestion is sufficiently near zenith (opposite the direction to the center of the Earth) that 11-p \n~ 90 deg, then F = Po and F will not be reduced by eclipses. For this condition, any eclipses \nwhich occur will happen when the face is shaded. Alternatively, consider what happens when \nIy- Ps'l =90 deg.In this case, there is only a smaIl portion of the orbit when the Sun shines on \nthe face. Let iP be the eclipse fraction from Eq. (5-4) and iP90 the azimuth definet\\ above at \nwhich the transition from sunlight to shade occurs. If iPl2 ~ the larger of IAzN \u00b1 iP90l, then the \nspacecraft will be in eclipse when the Sun is in a position to shine on the face. In this case F will \nbe reduced to O. For conditions in between these two extremes, F will be between 0 and its non-\neclipse value. Specific values will need to be evaluated numerically using Eqs. (5-4) and (5-8). \n\nThe heat input from both reflected and emitted radiation from the Earth increases the effective \nvalue of F. It is significantly more complex to compute than the effect of eclipses because of the \nextended size of the disk of the Earth and the variability in the intensity of reflected radiation. \nHowever, reasonable upper limits for radiation from the Earth are: \n\n\u2022 475 W/m2 for reflected solar radiation (albedo) \n\n\u2022 260 W/m2 for emitted IR radiation (thermal radiatian) \n\nSection 11.5 provides additional details on how to compute thermal inputs to the spacecraft. \n\n5.2 Earth Geometry Viewed from Space \n\nThe most common problem in space mission geometry is to determine the relative \ngeometry of objects on the Earth's surface as seen from the spacecraft. One example \nis to use the given coordinates of a target on the Earth to determine its coordinates in \nthe spacecraft field of view. Another is to determine the intercept point on the surface \nof the Earth corresponding to a given direction in spacecraft coordinates. \n\n5.2 Earth Geometry Viewed from Space 111 \n\nTo begin. we determine p, the angular radius of the spherical Earth as seen from the \nspacecraft, and A.o, the angular radius measured at the center of the Earth of the region \nseen by the spacecraft (see Fig. 5-11). Because we have assumed a spherical Earth, the \nline from the spacecraft to the Earth's horizon is perpendicular to the Earth's radius, \nand therefore \n\nand \n\nsinp=cosA.o = ~ \n~+H \n\np+ Au = 90 deg \nwhere RE is the radius of the Earth and H is the altitude of the satellite. \n\n(5-16) \n\n(5-17) \n\nFig. 5-11. Relationship Between Geometry as VJewed from the Spacecraft and from the \nCenter of the Earth. See also Ag. 5-12. \n\nThus, the Earth forms a small circle of radius p on the spacecraft sky, and the \nspacecraft sees the area within a small circle of radius A.o on the surface of the Earth. \nThe distance, DmiU' to the horizon is given by (see Fig. 5-13 below): \n\n(5-18) \n\nThe spherical-Earth approximation is adequate for most mission geometry appli-\ncations. However, for precise work, we must apply a correction for oblateness. as \nexplained in detail by Liu [1978] or Collins [1992]. The Earth's oblateness has two \ndistinct effects on the shape of the Earth as seen from space. First, the Earth appears \nsomewhat oblate rather than round, and second, the center of the visible oblate Earth \nis displaced from the true geometric center of the Earth. For all remaining computa-\ntions in this section, we will use splierical coordinates both on the Earth and in the \nspacecraft frame. Computationally, we can treat oblateness and surface irregularities \nas simply the target's altitude above or below a purely spherical Earth. That the Earth's \nreal surface is both irregular and oblate is immaterial to the computation, and, there-\nfore, the results are exact \n\n\n\n112 Space Mission Geometry \n\nWe wish to find the angular relationships between a target, P, on the surface of the \nEarth, and\u00b7a spacecraft with subsatellite point, SSP, also on the surface of the Earth, as \nshown in Fig. 5-12. We assume that the subsateUite point's latitude, Latssp and longi-\ntude, Longssp, are known. Depending on the application, we wish to solve one of two \nproblems: (1) given the coordinates of a target on the Earth, find its coordinates vieWed \nby the spacecraft, or (2) given the coordinates of a direction relative to the spacecraft, \nfind the coordinates of the intercept on the surface of the Earth. In both cases, we de-\ntermine the relative angles between SSP and P on the Earth's surface and then trans-\nform these angles into spacecraft coordinates. \n\nGiven the coordinates of the subsatellite point (Longssp, Latssp) and target \n(Longp, Latp), and defining IlL = 1 Longssp- Longp I, we wish to find the azimuth, \n(JJE' measured eastward from north, and angular distance, .it, from the subsateUite point \nto the target (See Fig. 5-12.) These are given by \n\ncos.it=sinLatsspsinLatp+cosLatsspcosLatp cos IlL (.it < IS0deg) (5-19) \n\ncos (JJE = (sin Latp - cos II. sin Latssp )/ (sin II. cos Latssp ) (5-20) \n\nwhere (JJE < ISO deg if P is east of SSP and (JJE > ISO deg if ~ is west of SSP. \n\nFig. 5-12. Relationship Between Target and SubsateliHe Point on the Earth's Surface. \n\nAlternatively, given the position of the subsateIIite point (Longssp, Latssp) and the \nposition of the target relative to this point \u00ab(JJE,II.), we want to determine the geo-\ngraphic coordinates of the target (Longp, Latp ): \n\ncos Lat; = cos.it sin LatSSP + sin II. cos Latssp cos (JJE (Lat; < ISO deg) (5-21) \n\ncosllL = (coSA.-sinLatssp sinLatp)/(cosLatsspcosLatp) (5-22) \n\nwhere Latp =90 deg - Latp andP is east of SSP if(JJE < ISO deg and west of SSP if \n(JJE > ISO deg. \n\nWe now wish to transform the coordinates on the Earth' s surface to coordinates as \nseen from the spacecraft. By symmetry, the azimuth of the target relative to north is \nthe same as viewed from either the spacecraft or the Earth. That is, \n\n'% spc = '% surface = (JJE (5-23) \n\n5.2 Earth Geometry Viewed from Space 113 \n\nTrue Outer Horizon \n\nJ~ ________________ I~mmm \n\nFIg. 5-13. Definition of Angular Relationships Between Satellite, Target, and Earth Center. \n\nGenerally, then, the only problem is to find the relationship between the nadir \nangle, 11, measured at the spacecraft from the subsateUite point (= nadir) to the target; \nthe Earth central angle, A., measured at the center of the Earth from the subsateUite \npoint to the target; and the grazing angle or spacecraft elevation angle, e, measured at \nthe target between the spacecraft and the local horizontal. Figure 5-13 defines these \nangles and related distances. First, we find the angular radius of the Earth, p, from \n\nsinp = cos A.o = ~ \nRE+H \n\nwhich is the same as Eq. (5-16). Next, if A. is known. we find 11 from \n\ntan 11 = sinpsinA. \n\nIf 11 is known, we fmd E from \n\nI-sinpcoSA. \n\ncos E= sin11 \nsinp \n\nOr, if E is known, we find 11 from \n\nsin 11 = cos E sin P \nFinally, the remaining angle and side are obtained from \n\n11+A.+E=90deg \n\nD = RE (sin .it/sin 11) \n\n(~-24) \n\n(5-25) \n\n(5-26a) \n\n(5-26b) \n\n(5-27) \n\n(5-2S) \n\nFigure 5-14 summarizes the process of transforming between spacecraft coordinates \nand Earth coordinates. \n\nAs an example, consider a satellite at an altitude of 1,000 km. From Eq. (5-16), the \nangular radius of the Earth p= 59.S deg. From Eqs.

We will assume a ground station at Hawaii \n(Latp = 22 deg, Longp = 200 deg) and a subsateUite point at Latssp = 10 deg, Longssp \n= 185 deg. From Eqs. (5-19) and (5-20), the ground station is a distance A = 18.7 deg \nfrom the subsateUite point, and has an azimuth relative to north = 48.3 deg. Using Eqs. \n(5-25) and (5-28) to transform into spacecraft coordinates, we find that from the space-\ncraft the target is 56.8 deg up from nadir (7J) at a line of sight distance, D, of 2,444 km. \nFrom Eq. (5-27), the elevation of the spacecraft as seen from the ground station is 145 \ndeg. The substantial foreshortening at the horizon can be seen in that at E = 14.5 deg \nwe are nearly half way from the horizon to the subsateUite point (A = 18.7 deg vs. 30.2 \ndeg at the horizon). \n\nUsing these equations, we can construct Fig. 5-15, which shows the Earth as seen \nfrom 1,000 km over Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico. The left side \nshows the geometry as seen on the surface of the Earth. The right side shows the \ngeometry as seen by the spacecraft projected onto the spacecraft-centered celestial \nsphere. As computed above, the maximum Earth central angle will be approximately \n30 deg from this altitude such that the spacecraft can see from northwestern South \nAmerica to Maine on the East Coast of the U.S. and Los Angeles on the West Coast. \nThe angular radius of the Earth as seen from the spacecraft will be 90 - 30 = 60 deg as \nshown in Fig. 5-15B. Because the spacecraft is over 20 North latitude, the direction to \nnadir in spacecraft coordinates will be 20 deg south of the celestial equator. (The \ndirection from the spacecraft to the Earth's center is exactly opposite the direction \nfrom the Earth's center to the spacecraft.) \n\nEven after staring at it a bit, the view from the spacecraft in Fig. 5-15B looks \nstrange. First, recall that we are looking at the spacecraft-centered celestial sphere \nfrom the outside. The spacecraft is at the center of the sphere. Therefore, the view for \nus is reversed from right-to-Ieft as seen by the spacecraft so that the Atlantic is on the \nleft and the Pacific on the right Nonetheless, there still appear to be distortions in the \nview. Mexico has an odd shape and South America has almost disappeared. All of this \n\n5.2 Earth Geometry Viewed from Space \n\nA. GaometJy on the Earth's Surface \n(SSP--Subsalellit8 PoInt) \n\nB.

Notice for \nexample that Jacksonville, FL, is about halfway from the subsateUite point to the \nhorizon. This means that only 1I4th of the area seen by the spacecraft is closer to the \nsubsatellite point than Jacksonville. Nonetheless. as seen from the perspective of the \nspacecraft, Jacksonville is 54 deg from nadir, i.e., 90% of the way to the horizon with \n3/4ths of the visible area beyond it \n\n\n\n116 Space Mission Geometry 5,2 \n\nThe rectangle in the upper left of Fig. 5-15B is the field of view of a 35 mm camera \nwith a 50 mm focal length lens (a normal lens that is neither wide angle nor telephoto). \nThe cameraperson on our spacecraft has photographed Florida and the eastern sea-\nboard of the US to approximately Maine The region seen on the Earth is shown in Fig. \n5-15X and 5-15B' and an enlargement of a portion of the photo from Georgia to \nMaine is shown in Fig. 5-15B'~ Note the dramatic foreshortening as Long Island and \nCape Cod become little more than horizontal lines, even though they are some distance \nfrom the horizon. This distortion does not come from the plotting style, but is what the \nspacecraft sees. We see the same effect standing on a hilltop or a mountain. (In a sense, \nthe spacecraft is simply a very tall mountain.) Most of our angular field of view is \ntaken up by the field or mountain top we are standing on. For our satellite, most of \nwhat i~ seen is the Yucatan and Gulf of Mexico directly below. There is lots of real \nestate at the horizon, but it appears very compressed. From the spacecraft, I can point \nan antenna at Long Island, but I can not map it We must keep this picture in mind \nwhenever we assess a spacecraft's fields of view or measurement needs. \n\nThus far we have considered spacecraft geometry oilly from the point of view of a \nspacecraft fixed over one point on the Earth. In fact, of course, the spacecraft is travel-\ning at high velocity. Figure 5-16A shows the path of the subsatellite point over the \nEarth's surface, called the satellite's ground trace or ground track. Locally, the ground \ntrace is very nearly the arc of a great circle. However, because of the Earth's rotation, \nthe spacecraft moves over the Earth's surface in a spiral pattern with a displacement \nat successive equator crossings directly proportional to the orbit period. For a satellite \nin a circular orbit at inclination i, the subsatellite latitude, 8a, and longitude, La, relative \nto the ascending node are \n\nsin 8s = sin i sin (0) t) \n\ntan (Ls + WEt) = cos i tan (w t) \n\n(5-29) \n\n(5-30) \n\nwhere t is the time since the satellite crossed the equator northbound, \nWE = 0.004 178 07 deg/s is the rotational velocity of the Earth on its axis, and 0) is the \nsatellite's angular velocity. For a satellite in a circular orbit, win deg/s is related to the \nperiod, P, in minutes by \n\nw = 61 P ~ 0.071 deg/s (5-31) \n\nwhere 0.071 deg/s is the maximum angular velocity of a spacecraft in a circular orbit \nSimilarly, the ground track velocity, Yg, is \n\nYg = 2n REIP S 7.905 kmls (5-32) \n\nwhere RE = 6,378 km is the equatorial radius of the Earth. For additional information \non the satellite ground trace and coverage, taking into account the rotation of the Earth, \nsee Chap. 8 of Wertz [2001]. \n\nFig. 5-16B shows the swath coverage for a satellite in low-Earth orbit The swath \nis the area on the surface of the Earth around the ground trace that the satellite can \nobserve as it passes overhead. From the fonnulas for stationary geometry in \nEqs. (5-24) to (5-27), we can compute the width of the swath in tenns of the Earth \ncentral angle, A.. Neglecting the Earth's rotation, the area coverage rate, ACR, of a \nspacecraft will be \n\nACR = 2n (sin Aouter \u00b1 sin Aw.n.er)1 P (5-33) \n\n5.3 Apparent Motion of Satellites for an Observer on the Earth 117 \n\nA.

A swath which goes from horizon to \nhorizon will cover a very large area, although we will see most of this area at very \nshallow elevation angles near the horizon. \n\nwhere A 14 is the effective outer horizon, Aw.n.er is the inner horizon, the area on the \nEarth's :urface is in steradians, and P is the orbital period of the satellite. The plus sign \napplies to horizons on opposite sides of the ground trace and .the minus si~ to both \nhorizons on one side, that is, when the spacecraft looks exclUSIvely left or nght For a \nswath of width 2A symmetric about the ground trace, this reduces to \n\nACR = (4nl P) sin A (5-34) \n\nAlternatively, this can be expressed in terms of the limiting grazing angle (or elevation \nangle), E, and angular radius of the Earth, p, as \n\nACR = (4n1P) cos (E+ arc sin (cos Esin p\u00bb (5-35) \nBecause the curvature of the Earth's surface strongly affects the ACR, Eqs. (5-33) \n\nto (5-35) are not equal to the length of the arc between the effective horizons times \neither the velocity of the spac,ecraft or the velocity of the subsatellite point. \n\n5.3 Apparent Motion of Satellites for an Observer on the Earth \n\nEven for satellites in perfectly circular orbits, the apparent motion of a satellite \nacross the sky for an observer on the Earth's surface is not a simple geometrical figure. \nIf the observer is in the orbit plane, then the apparent path of the satellite will be a great \ncircle going directly overhead. If the observer is somewhat outside of the orbit plane, \nthen the instantaneous orbit will be a large circle in three-dimensional space viewed \nfrom somewhat outside the plane of the circle and projected onto the observer's celes-\ntial sphere. \n\nBecause the apparent satellite path is not a simple geometrical figure, it is best \ncomputed using a simulation program. Available commercial programs include \nSatellite Tool Kit (1990), Orbit View and Orbit Workbench (1991), Orbit II Plus \n(1991), and MicroGWBE (1990), which generated the figures in this chapter .. These \nprograms also work with elliptical orbits, so they are convenient-along WIth the \n\n\n\n118 Space Mission Geometry 5.3 \n\nappropriate formulas from this chapter-for evaluating specific orbit geometry. \nUnfortunately, a simulation does not provide the desired physical insight into the \napparent motion of satellites. Neither does it provide a rapid method of evaluating \ngeometry in a general case, as is most appropriate when first designing a mission. For \nthese problems, we are interested in either bounding or approximating the apparent \nmotion of satellites rather than in computing it precisely. After all, the details of a \nparticular pass will depend greatly on the individual geometrical conditions. Approx-\nimate analytic formulas are provided by Wertz [1981,2001]. For mission design, the \ncircular orbit formulas provided below for satellites in low-Earth orbit and geo-\nsynchronous orbit work well. \n\n5.3.1 Satemtes in Circular Low-Earth Orbit \nWe assume a satellite is in a circular low-Earth orbit passing near a target-or ground \n\nstation. We also assume that the orbit is low enough that we can ignore the Earth's \nrotation in the relatively brief period for which the satellite passes overhead.\" We wish \nto determine the characteristics of the apparent satellite motion as seen from the \nground station. Throughout this section we use the notation adopted in Sec. 52. \nFigure 5-17 shows the geometry. The small circle centered on the ground station \nrepresents the subsatellite points at which the spacecraft elevation, E, seen by the \nground station is greater than some minimum Emin. The nature of the communication \nor observation will determine the value of Emin. For communications, the satellite \ntypically must be more than 5 deg above the horizon, so Emin >= 5 deg. The size of this \ncircle of accessibility strongly depends on the value of Emin, as emphasized in the dis-\ncussion of Fig. 5-15. In Fig. 5-17 we have assumed a satellite altitude of 1,000 km. The \ndashed circle surrounding the ground station is at Emin = 0 deg (that is, the satellite's \ntrue outer horizon), and the solid circle represents Emm = 5 deg. In practice we typically \nselect a specific value of Emin and use that number. However, you should remain aware \nthat many of the computed parameters are extremely sensitive to this value. \n\nFIg. 5-17. Geometry of Satellite Ground Track Relative to an Observer on the Earth's \nSurface. \n\n\u2022 See Chap. 9 of Wertz [2001] for a more accurate approximation which takes the Earth's rota-\ntion into account. \n\n5.3 Apparent Motion of Satellites for an Observer on the Earth 119. \n\nGiven a value of s\",in' we can define the maximum Earth central angle, AmID\" the \nmaximum nadir angle, l1max> measured at the satellite from nadir to the ground station, \nand the maximum range, Dmax> at which the satellite will still be in view. These \nparameters as determined by applying Eqs. (5-26a) to (5-28) are given by: \n\nsin l1max = sin p cos smin (5-36) \n\nilmax = 90 deg - smin -l1max \nD = R sin ilmax \n\nmax E sinn ',max \n\n(5-37) \n\n(5-38) \n\nwhere p is the angular radius of the Earth as seen from the satellite, that is, sin p = \nRE/(R E + H). We call the smail circle of radius Amax centered on the target the effective \nhorizon, corresponding in our example to s\",in = 5 deg, to distinguish it f!om t~e t,\"!,e \nor geometrical horizon for which smin = 0 deg. Whenever .the subsatelhte ~mt .lIes \nwithin the effective horizon around the target or ground station, then communications \nor observations are possible. The duration, T, of this contact and the maximum eleva-\ntion angle, s\",ax' of the satellite depends on how close the ground station is to the \nsatel{ite's ground track on any given orbit pass. \n\nAs described in Chap. 6, the plane of a spacecraft's orbit and, therefore, the ground \ntrack, is normally defined by the inclination, i, and either the right ascension, n, or \nlongitude, Lnode' of the ascending node. Except for orbit perturbations, n, which is \ndefined relative to the stars, remains fixed in inertial space while the Earth rotates \nunder the orbit On the other hand, Lnodeis defined relative to the Earth's surface and, \ntherefore, increases by 360 deg in 1,436 min, which is the rotation p::riod of the Earth \nrelative to the stars. (Again, orbit perturbations affect the exact rotation rate.) Because \nof this orbit rotation relative to the Earth, it is convenient to speak of the instantaneous \nascending node which is Lnode evaluated at the time of an observation or passage over \na ground station. For purposes of geometry it is also o~en appropriat~ to work in terms \nof the instantaneous orbit pole, or the pole of the OrbIt plane at the time of the obser-\nvation. The coordinates of this pole are \n\nlatpo/e= 9Odeg-i (5-39) \n\nlongpo/e = Lnode-90 deg (5-40) \n\nA satellite passes directly over a target or ground station (identified by the subscript \ngs) on the Earth's surface ifand only if \n\nsin (longgs-Lnode) = tan latgsl tan i (5-41) \n\nThere are two valid solutions to the above equation corresponding to the satellite pass-\ning over the ground station on the northbound leg of the orbit or on the southbound \nleg. To determine when after crossing the equator the satellite passes ov~r the ground \nstation for a circular orbit, we can determine J.l, the arc length along the InstantaneoUS \nground track from the ascending node to the ground station, from \n\nsin Jl = sin latgsl sin i (5-42) \n\nAgain, the two valid solutions correspond to the northbound and southbound passes. \nFigure 5-17 defines the parameters of the satellite's pass overhead in terms oUmin, \n\nthe minimum Earth central angle between the satellite's ground track and the ground \nstation.

This will occur at an altitude of 35,786 km, for which the satellite \nperiod is 1,436 min. equaling the Earth's sidereal rotation period relative to the fixed \nstars. Chapter 6 describes the long-term drift of geostationary satellites. We describe \nhere the apparent daily motion of these satellites as seen by an observer on the Earth. \n\nFor convenience, we assume the observer is at the center of the Earth and compute \nthe apparent motion from there. The detailed motion seen from a lOcation on the \nEarth's surface will be much more complex because the observer is displaced relative \nto the Earth's center. (See Wertz [2001].) But the general results will be the same, and \nthe variations can be computed for any particular location. \n\n\n\n122 \n\nA. Geometry on the Globe \n\nSpace Mission Geometry \n\nHorizoA \n\nB.

See text for formulas. \n\nOrbit inclination and eccentricity are the principal causes of the apparent daily \nmotion of a geosynchronous satellite. These two effects yield different-shaped appar-\nent orbits, which can cause confusion if the source of the apparent motion is not cIeiuiy \nidentified. As Fig. 5-19A shows, the inclination of the orbit produces a figure eight \ncentered on the equator, as seen by an observer at the Earth's center.

The source of this \nfigure eight or analemma is the motion of the satellite along its inclined orbit, which \nwill alternately fall behind and t,hen catch up to the uniform rotation of the Earth on \nits axis. \n\n\u2022 The second factor which causes a nonuniform apparent motion is a nonzero eccen-\ntricity of the satellite orbit An eccentricity, e; causes an East-West oscillation, WeeI:' of \nmagnitude \n\n):360 deg) \u00b1( ) wecc = \\. 7t e= + 115 deg e (5-55) \n\nIn general, the inclination and eccentricity motions are superimposed, resulting in \ntwo possible shapes for the motion of the geosynchronous satellite as seen from the \nEarth. If the nonzero inclination effect dominates, then the satellite appears to move in \na figure eight If the eccentricity effect is larger than the inclination effect, then the \napparent motion is a single open oval, as shown in Fig. 5-19B .. \n\nFor satellites above geosynchronous orbit, the rotation of the Earth on its axis \ndominates the apparent motion of the satellite. Consequently, it is most convenient in \nthis case to plot the motion of the satellite relative to the background of the fixed stars. \n\n5.4 Development of Mapping and Pointing Budgets \n\n2w-11- 0.03 deg \n\nA. i=2deg \ne=O \n\nT \n1~ \n\nB. 1=2deg \ne=O.OOl \n\nFig. 5-19. Apparent Dally Motion of a Satellite In Geosynchronous Orbit. \n\n123 \n\nIn this coordinate frame, we can handle the motion relative to the fixed inertial back-\nground just the same as we do the apparent motion of the Moon or planets. Many \nintroductory texts on celestial mechanics treat this issue. See, for example, Roy \n[1991], Green [1985], or Smart [1977], or Wertz [2001]. \n\n5.4 Development of Mapping and Pointjng Budgets \n\nNearly all spacecraft missions involve sensing or interaction with the world around. \nthem, so a spacecraft needs to know or control its orientation. We may conveniently \ndivide this problem of orientation into two .areas of pointing and mapping. Pointing \nmeans orienting the spacecraft, camera. sensor, or antenna to a target having a specific \ngeographic position or inertial direction. Mapping is determining the geographic \nposition of the look point of a camera. sensor, or antenna. Satellites used only for \ncommunications will generally require only pointing. Satellites having some type of \nviewing instrument, such as weather, ground surveillance, or Earth resources satel-\nlites, will ordinarily require both pointing (\"point the instrument at New Yorlc'') and \nmapping (\"determine the geographic location of the tall building in pixel 2073'') . \n\nThe goal of this section is to develop budgets for pointing and mapping. A budget \nlists all the sources of pointing and mapping errors and how much they contribute to \nthe overall pointing and mapping accuracy. This accuracy budget frequently drives \nboth the cost and performance of a space mission. If components in the budget are left \n\n. out or incorrectly assessed, the satellite may not be able to meet its performance \nobjectives. More commonly, people who define the system requirements make the \nbudgets for pointing and mapping too stringent and, therefore, unnecessarily drive \nup the cost of the mission. As a result, we must understand from the start the compo-\nnents of mapping and pointing budgets and how they affect overall accuracy. In this \nsection we will emphasize Earth-oriented missions. but the same basic rules apply to \ninertially-oriented missions. \n\nThe components of the pointing and mapping budgets are shown in Fig. 5-20 and \ndefined in Table 5-5. BaSic pointing and mapping errors are associated with spacecraft \nnavigation-that is, knowledge of itS position and attitude in space. But even if the \n\n\n\n124 Space Mission Geometry 5.4 \n\nposition and attitude are known precisely, a number of other errors will be present For \nexample, an error in the observation time will result in an error in the computed loca-\ntion of the target, because the target frame of reference moves relative to the \nspacecraft. A target fixed on the Earth's equator will rotate with the Earth at 464 mls. \nA IO-sec error in the observation time would produce an error of 5 kIn in the computed \ngeographic location of the target. Errors in the target altitude, discussed below, can be \na key component of pointing and mapping budgets. The instrument-mounting error \nrepresents the misalignment between the pointed antenna or instrument and the sensor \nor sensorS used to determine the attitude. This error is extremely difficult to remove. \nBecause we cannot determine it from the attitude data alone, we must view it as a crit-\nical parameter and keep it small while integrating the spacecraft. \n\nFig. 5-20. DefInition of Pointing and Mapping Error Components. \n\nPointing errors differ from mapping errors in the way they include inaccuracies in \nattitude control and angular motion. Specifically, the pointing error must include the \nentire control error for the spacecraft. On the other hand, the only control-related \ncomponent of the mapping error is the angular motion during the exposure or \nobservation time. This short-term jitter results in a blurring of the look point of the \ninstrument or antenna. \n\nAs discussed earlier in Sec. 4.2.2, we may achieve an accuracy goal for either point-\ning or mapping in many ways. We may, in one instance, know the position of the \nspacecraft precisely and the attitude only poorly. Or we may choose to allow a larger \nerror in position and make the requirements for determining the attitude more strin-\ngent In an ideal world we would look at all components of the pointing and mapping \nbudgets and adjust them until a small increment of accuracy costs the same for each \ncomponent For example, assume that a given mission requires a pointing accuracy of \n20 milliradians; and that we tentatively assign 10 milliradians to attitude determination \nand 5 milliradians to position determination. We also find more accurate attitude \nwould cost $100,000 per milliradian, whereas more accurate position would cost only \n$50,000 per milliradian. In this case we should allow the attitude accuracy to degrade \nand improve the position-accuracy requirement until the cost per milliradian is the \nsame for both. We will then have the lowest cost solution. \n\n5.4 Development of Mapping and Pointing Budgets \n\nTABLE 5-5.

T Clock error \n\nUncertainty In the altitude of the observed object \n\nUncertainty in the real observation time (results in \nuncertainty in the rotational position of the Earth) \n\n125 \n\nIn practice we can seldom follow the above process. For example, we cannot \nimprove accuracy continuously. Rather, we must often accept large steps in both \nperformance and cost as we change methods or techniques. Similarly, we seldom \nknow precisely how much money or what level of performance to budget In practice \nthe mission designer strives to balance the components, often by relying on experience \nand intuition as much as analysis. But the overall goal remains correct We should try \nto balance the error budget so that incrementally improving any of th~ components \nresults in approximately comparable cost. \n\nA practical method of creating an error budget is as follows. We begin by writing \ndown all of the components of the pointing and mapping budgets from Table 5-5. We \nassume that these components are unrelated to each other, being prepared to combine \nthem later by taking the root sum square of the individual elements. (We will have to \nexamine this assumption in light of the eventual mission design and adjust it to take \ninto account how the error components truly combine.) The next step is to spread the \nbudget equally among all components. Thus, if all seven error sources listed in \nTable 5-5 are relevant to the problem, we will initially assign an accuracy requirement \nfor each equid to the total accuracy divided by J1. This provides a starting point for \nallocating errors. Our next step is to look at normal spacecraft operations and divide \nthe error sources into three categories: \n\n(A) Those allowing very little adjustment \n\n(B) Those easily meeting the error allocation established for them, and \n\n(C) Those allowing increased accuracy at increased cost \n\nDetermining the spacecraft position using ground radar is a normal operation, and \nthe ground station provides a fixed level of accuracy. We cannot adjust this error \nsource without much higher cost, so we assign it to category (A) and accept its corre-\nsponding level of accuracy. A typical example of category (B) is the observation time \nfor which an accuracy of tens of milliseconds is reasonable with modem spacecraft \nclocks. Therefore, we will assign an appropriately small number (say 10 IDS) to the \naccuracy associated with the timing error. Attitude determination ordinarily falls into \n\n\n\n126 Space Mission Geometry 5.4 \n\nTABLE 5-6. MappIng and PoInting Error Formulas.

Here we might have a gravity gradient-stabilized system accurate to a \nfew degrees with no attitude detennination cost at all, an horizon sensor system accu-\nrate to 0.05-0.10 deg, or a much more expensive star sensor system accurate to better \nthan 0.01 deg (see Sec. 11.1). \n\nThis process allows us to balance cost between the appropriate components and to \ngo back to the mission definition and adjust the real requirements. For example, \nachieving a mapping accuracy of 100 m on the ground might triple the cost of the space \nmission by requiring highly accurate attitude determination, a new system for \ndetermining the orbit, and a detailed list of target altitudes. Reducing the accuracy \nrequirement to 500 m might lower the cost enough to make the mission possible within \nthe established budget constraints. This is an example of trading on mission require-\nments, descn\"bed in Chaps. 2 to 4. Requirements trading is extremely important to a \ncost-effective mission, but we often omit this in the normal process of defining \nmission requirements. \n\nTo carry out this trade process; we need to know how an error in each of the com-\nponents described in Table 5-5 relates to the overall mapping and pointing errors. \n\n5.4 Development of Mapping and Pointing Budgets 127 \n\nTable 5-6 gives fonnulas relating the errorS in each of the seven basic components to \nthe overall error. Here the notation used is the same as in Fig. 5-20. For any given \nmission conditions, these formulas relate the errors in the fundamental components to \nthe resulting pointing and mapping accuracies. Table 5-6 provides basic algebraic \ninformation which we must transfonn into specific mapping and pointing require-\nments for a given mission. The general process of deriving these requirements is given \nbelow. Representative mapping and pointing budgets based on these formulas are \ngiven in Table 5-7 \n\nTABLE 5-7.

Working in a very small region directly under the spacecraft \nprovides very poor coverage but excellent mapping accuracy and resolution (see \nFig. 5-21). On the other hand, working near the horizon provides very broad coverage \nbut poor mapping accuracy. Thus, we must trade resolution and mapping accuracy for \ncoverage. The mapping accuracy for a particular mission depends on the spacecraft's \nelevation angle at the edge of the coverage region. In almost all cases the mapping \naccuracy will be much better looking straight down. and the limiting accuracy will be \nclosest to the horizon. To assess satellite coverage, we look at the satellite's swath \nwidth. That is, we assume the spacecraft can work directly below itself and at all \nangles out to a limiting spacecraft elevation angle as seen from a target on the ground. \n\nAccuracy characteristics as a function of elevation angle are more complex because \nthey involve combining several terms. A sample plot of mapping error as a function of \nthe spacecraft's elevation angle for a satellite at 1,000 km is in Fig. 5-22. This figure \nis based on the equations in Table 5-6. \n\nThe total- mapping error is the root sum square of the individual components. \nGenerally. uncertaintY in target altitude and in attitude determination contn\"bute most \nto errors in mapping accuracy.

Consequently, determining target altitude and spacecraft attitude \nare high priorities in assessing a mission's mapping performance and cost. \n\nThe uncertainty in target altitude typically contributes most to determining a \ngeographic location on the Earth. The oblateness of the Earth has the largest effect on \ntarget altitude. It causes a variation in distance from the center of the Earth of \napproximately 25 km between the poles and the equator. But we can account for this \nfactor analytically at very low cost, so it does not usually add to the error. The next \nplateau is for airplanes, clouds, or other atmospheric features. The uncertainty in target \naltitude at this level will typically be 10 km or larger unless we have some a priori \nestimate of the altitude. For features on the Earth's surface, the uncertainty in target \naltitude reduces to approximately I lan, unless data analysis includes a detailed map \nof target altitudes. Figure 5-22 incorporates this I km error in target altitude as the \ndominant source of error. Thus, for example, for FireSat to have a mapping error of \nless than I Ian would require one of two arrangements. The spacecraft could work only \nvery near nadir and therefore have very poor coverage. Alternatively, it could inclUde \nthe elevation of the target region as a part of data reduction, therefore requiring the use \nof a very large data base and making the data processing more complex. \n\nThe second principal contributor to mapping error is the uncertainty in attitude \ndetermination, which varies widely over the following cost plateaus: \n\nAccuracy Level (deg) \n-10 \n\n-2 \n0.5 \n0.1 \n0.03 \n\n<0.01 \n\nMethod \nGravity gradient spacecraft, no attitude \n\ndetermination \nMagnetometer only \nEarth sensing, no oblateness corrections \nGeneral Earth sensing \nHigh-accuracy Earth sensing \nStar sensing \n\n5.4 Development of Mapplog and Pointing Budgets 129 \n\n4 Tr-----..--r------------------------------. \n\n~3 \n\n!-\n~ \nal 2 \n\nJ \n1 \n\not=~~==~~~~~~~~~ \no 15 30 45 60 75 90 \n\nSpacecraft Elevation Seen from Ground (deg) \n\nAg.5-22.

Pointing Error asa Function of Elevation Angle for a Spacecraft at 1,000 km \nAltitude. Magnitude of assumed error sources are marked. \n\nUsing these general limits in a model such as that of Fig. 5-22 allows us to assess \naccuracies as a function of cost and coverage. \n\nDefining Pointing Requirements \n\nUnlike mapping, pointing depends only weakly on the spacecraft's elevation angle. \n(See Fig. 5-23.) Thus, for missions which require only pointing, working in a region \n\n\n\n130 Space Mission Geometry \n\nnear the horizon is almost as easy as pointing to a target or ground antenna at nadir. In \nthis case the working limit on the spacecraft's elevation angle depends on other \nfactors, such as the transmission of the atmosphere for a selected wavelength or pos-\nsible obstruction by local geography. For example, ground stations ordinarily limit \ntheir elevation to approximately 5 deg above the horizon because of the reduced atmo-\nspheric transmission at lower elevation angles. \n\nPointing requirements nonnaUy arise from the spacecraft's housekeeping functions \nor from the need to point a particular instrument or antenna toward a ground target \nHousekeeping requirements such as solar array pointing and orbit maneuvers ordi-\nnarily demand pointing accuracies of 0.25 to 1 deg. Consequently, for most missions, \nthe need to point the mission sensor or antenna is more important. Here again two \ncases exist. If we wish to point the sensor at a single target, then we will generally try \nto point the center of the sensor at the target. By doing so, we establish a pointing \nrequirement to place the target within the field of view. Specifically, if the payload \nsensor's field of view is four times the 3a-pointing error, then the target will lie within \nthe field of view with a 60- probability, or virtual certainty. For example, if the FJreSat \nsensor has a 1 deg square field of view, an overall pointing requirement of 0.25 deg \nwill assure that the target will be within the field of view. \n\nIn pointing we may also want to eliminate overlapping coverage. For example, if \nwe wish to take a series of pictures, we must overlap the pictures by more than the \npointing error to ensure continuous coverage of the ground This requirement, in turn, \nimplies that the spacing between pictures must equal the field-of-view size less the \npointing error. Thus, with a large pointing error, we must accept having fewer pictures \nat a given time and increased resource costs in terms of time, power, and data rate for \na given level of coverage. It is common to have a pointing accuracy of 10% to 20% of \nthe field-of-view diameter. Driving the pointing under 10% of the field-of-view diam-\neter will only slightly improve overall coverage. On the other hand, a pointing error \nworse than 20% of the field-of-view size can require substantial overlap. thus greatly \ndiminishing the overall system's coverage and resource utilization. \n\nReferences \nCollins, Steve. 1992. \"Geocentric Nadir and Range from Horizon Sensor Observations \n\nof the Oblate Earth.\" AIAA Paper No. 92-176 presented at the AAS/AISS Space-\nflight Mechanics Meeting.

The satellite's ephemeris is a table listing its position as a function of time. The \nfirst section below explains the terms used to describe satellite orbits, provides equa-\ntions necessary to calculate orbital elements from position and velocity, and shows \nhow to predict the future position and velocity of a satellite. We base this method on \na simple, but accurate, model treating the Earth and the satellite as spherical masses. \nThe next section discusses how forces other than the Newtonian gravitational force \naffect the OIbit of a satellite. The third section explains maneuvering strategies used to \nchange the satellite's orbit. The final two sections discuss the available launch times \nand methods for maintaining satellite orbits. \n\nSeveral textbooks are available in the areas of satellite orbits and celestial mechan-\nics. Some of the most popular are Bate. Mueller, and White [1971], Battin [1999]. \nDanby [1962], Escobal [1965], Kaplan [1976], and Roy [1991]. More recently \nChobotov [1996], Wiesel [1996], and Vallado [1997] have provided works specifical-\nlyon spacecraft astrodynamics. \n\n131 \n\n\n\n132 Introdnction to Astrodynamles 6.1 \n\n6.1 Keplerian Orbits \n\nExplaining the motion of celestial bodies, especially the planets, has challenged \nobservers for many centuries. The early Greeks attempted to describe the motion of \ncelestial bodies about the Earth in terms of circular motion. In 1543, Nicolaus Coper-\nnicus proposed a heliocentric (Sun-centered) system with the planets following circu-\nlar orbits. Finally, with the help ofTycho Brahe's observational data, Johannes Kepler \ndescribed elliptical planetary orbits about the Sun. Later, Isaac Newton provided a \nmathematical solution for this system based on an inverse-square gravitational force. \n\nKepler spent several years reconciling the differences between Tycho Brahe's care-\nful observations of the planets and their predicted motion based on previous theories: \nHaving found that the data matched ,a geometric solution of elliptical orbits, he \npublished his first two laws of planetary motion in 1609 and his third law in 1619. \nKepler's three laws of planetary motion (which also apply to satellites orbiting the \nEarth) are: . \n\n\u2022 First Law: The orbit of each planet is an ellipse, with the Sun at one focus. \n\n\u2022 'Second Law: The line joining the planet to the Sun sweeps out equal areas in \nequal times. \n\n\u2022 Third Law: The square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of \nits mean distance from the Sun. \n\n6.1.1 SatelHte Equations of Motion \nFigure 6-1 depicts the key parameters of an elliptical orbit. The eccentricity, e, of \n\nthe ellipse (not shown in the figure) is equal to cia and is a measure of the deviation of \nthe ellipse from a circle. \n\nIsaac Newton explained mathematically why the planets (and satellites) follow \nelliptical orbits. Newton's Second Law of Motion, applied to a constant mass system \nand, combined with his Law of Universal Gravitation, provides the mathematical basis \nfor analyzing satellite orbits. Newton's law of gravitation states that any two bodies \nattract each other with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely \nproportional to the square of the distance between them. The equation for the magni-\ntude of the force caused by gravity is \n\nF= -GMmlr2 \n== -Jl1TII r2 (6-1) \n\nwhere F is the magnitude of the force caused by gravity, G is the universal constant of \ngravitation, M is the mass of the Earth, m is the mass of the satellite, r is the distance \nfrom the center of the Earth to the satellite, and Jl == GM is the Earth's gravitational \nconstant (= 398,6005 km3S-l). \n\nCombining Newton's second law with his law of gravitation, we obtain an equation \nfor the-acceleration vector of the satellite: \n\n(6-2) \n\nThis equation, called the two-body equation of motion, is the relative equation of \nmotion of a satellite position vector as the satellite orbits the Earth. In deriving it, we \nassumed that gravity is the only force, the Earth is spherically symmetric, the Earth's \nmass is much greater than the satellite's mass, and the Earth and the satellite are the \nonly two bodies in the system. \n\n6.1 \n\n2b \n\nKeplerian Orbits \n\n-----r------------\n\n, \nI \nI I \n\n- -- --- ~ -----'.- -- --- -----2c'------\n:.. 28 : ~ \n: .. ~ .. :--IP-: \nI \n\nr: position vector of the satellite relative to Earth's center \n\nV: velocity vector of the satellite relative to Earth's center \n\n~: f1ight-path-angle, the angle between the velocity vector and a line \nperpendicular to the position vector \n\na: semi major axis of the eRipse \n\nb: semiminor axis of the ellipse \n\nc: the distance from the center of the orbit to one of the focil \n\nv: the polar angle of the ellipse. also called the true anomaly. measured In the \ndirection of motion from the direction of perigee to the position vector \n\nrA: radius of apogee, the distance from Earth's center to the farthest point on the \ne1fipse \n\nr p: radius of perigee, the distance from Earth's center to the point of closest \napproach to the Earth \n\n133 \n\nFig. 6-1. Geometry of an Ellipse and OrbHal Parameters. \n\nA solution to the two-body equation of motion for a satellite orbiting Earth is the \npolar equation of a conic section. It gives the magnitude of the position vector in terms \nof the location in the orbit, \n\nr = a(1 - e2)/(1 + e cos v) (6-3) \nwhere a is the semimajor axis, e is the eccentricity, and v is the polar angle or true \nanomaly. \n\nA conic section is a curve formed by the intersection of a plane passing through a \nright circular cone. As Fig. 6-2 shows, the angular orientation of the plane relative to \nthe cone determines whether the conic section is a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyper-\nbola. We can define all conic sections in terms of the eccentricity, e, in Ecj. (6-3) \nabove. The type of conic section is also related to the semimajor axis, a, and the \nspecific mechanical energy, &. Table 6-1 shows the relationships between energy, \neccentricity, and semimajor axis and the type of conic section. \n\n\n\n134 Introduction to Astrodynamics 6.I \n\n\\ \n\nFig. 6-2.

We refer to Eq. (6-4) as the energy equation. Because the forces in the \nsystem are conservative, the energy is a constant The term for potential energy, -\"vr, \ndefines the potential energy to be zero at infinity and negative at any radius less than \ninfinity. Using this definition, the specific mechanical energy of elliptical orbits will \nalways be negative. As the energy increases (approaches zero), the ellipse gets larger, \nand the elliptical trajectory approaches a parabolic trajectory. From the energy \nEq. (6-4), we find that a satel!ite moves fastest at perigee of the orbit and slowest at \napogee. \n\n6.1 Keplerian Orbits 135 \n\nWe also know that for a circle the semimajor axis equals the radius, which is \nconstant. Rearranging the energy equation, we find the velocity of a satellite in a \ncircular orbit. \n\nVcir = (Ill r)112 (6-5) \n\n:;; 7.905 .366 (Re Ir)112 \n:;; 6313481 ,112 \n\nwhere ~Ir is the circular velocity in kmls, RE is the Earth's radius in km, and r is the \norbit's radius in km. \n\nFrom Table 6-1, the energy of a parabolic trajectory is zero. A parabolic trajectory \nis one with the minimum energy needed to escape the gravitational attraction of Earth. \nThus, we can calculate the velocity required to escape from the Earth at any distance, \nr, by setting energy equal to zero in Eq. (6-4) and solving for velocity. \n\nVest\" = (2111 r) 112 (6-6) \n\n:;; 11.l79 88 (REI r)112 \n\n:;; 892.8611 r-l12 \n\nwhere ~ is the escape velocity in kmls, and r is in kIn. . \nAnother constant of motion associated with a satellite orbit is the specific angular \n\nmomentum, b, which is the satellite's total angular momentum divided by its mass. We \ncan find it from the cross product of the position and velocity vectors. \n\nb=r xv (6-7) \n\nWe find that from Kepler's second law, the angular momentum is constant in \nmagnitude and direction for the two-body problem. Therefore, the orbital plane \ndefined by the position and velocity veCtors must remain fixed in inertial space. \n\n6.1.3 Oassical Orbital Elements \nWhen solving the two-body equations of motion, we need six constants of \n\nintegration (initial conditions) for the solution. Theoretically, we could find the three \ncomponents of position and velocity at any time in terms of the position and velocity \nat any other time. Alternatively, we can completely describe the orbit with five \nconstants and one quantity which varies with time. These quantities, called classical \norbital elements, are defined below and are shown in Fig. 6-3. The coordinate frame \nshown in the figure is the geocentric inertial frame: or Gel, defined in Chap. 5 (see \nTable 5-1). Its origin is at the center of the Earth, with the X-axis in the equatorial \nplane and pointing to the vernal equinox. Also, the Z-axis is parallel to the Earth's spin \naxis (the North Pole), and the Y-axis completes the right-hand set in the equatorial \nplane. The classical orbital elements are: \n\na: semimajor axis: describes the size of the ellipse (see Fig. 6-1). \n\ne: eccentricity: describes the shape of the ellipse (see Fig. 6-1). \n\n\u2022 A SUfficiently inertial coordinate frame is a coordinate frame that we can consider to be non-\naccelerating fOI: the particular application. The Gel frame is sufficiently inertial when \nconsidering Earth-orbiting satellites, but is inadequate for interplanetary travel because of its \nrotational acceleration around the Sun. \n\n\n\n136 Introduction to Astrodynamics \n\ni: inclination: the angle between the angular momentum vector and the unit \nvector in the Z-direction. \n\n.Q: right ascension of the ascending node: the angle from the vernal equinox to \nthe ascending node. The ascending node is the point where the satellite passes \nthrough the equatorial plane moving from south to north. Right ascension is \nmeasured as a right-handed rotation about the pole, Z. \n\n(1): argument of perigee: the angle from the ascending node to the eccentricity \nvector measured in the direction of the satellite's motion. The eccentricity \nvector points from the center of the Earth to perigee with a magnitude equal \nto the eccentricity of the orbit. \n\nv: true anomaly: the angle from the eccentricity vector to the satellite position \nvector, measured in the direction of satellite motion. Alternately, we could \nuse time since perigee passage, T. \n\nz \n\nDefined) \n\nRg. 6-3. Definition of the Keplerlan Orbital Elements of a Satellite In an Elliptic Orbit. We \ndefine elements relative to the Gel coordinate frame. \n\nGiven these definitions, we can solve for the elements if we know the satellite's \nposition and velocity vectors. Equations (6-4) and (6-7) allow us to solve for the \nenergy and the angular momentum vector. An equation for the nodal vector, n, in the \ndirection of the ascending node is \n\nn=Zxh (6-8) \nWe can calculate the eccentricity vector from the following equation: \n\ne=(l/J.I.){(V2 - J.l.lr)r -(r\u00b7v)v} (6-9) \nTable 6-2 lists equations to derive the classical orbital elements and related param-\n\neters for an elliptical orbit. \nEquatorial (i = 0) and circular (e = 0) orbits demand alternate orbital elements to \n\nsolve the equations in Table 6-2. These are shown in Fig. 6-3. For equatorial orbits, a \nsingle angle, II, can replace the right ascension of the ascending node and argument \nof perigee. Called the longitude of perigee, this angle is the algebraic sum of.Q and w. \nAs i approaches 0, II approaches the angle from the X-axis to perigee. For circular \n\n6.1 Keplerian Orbits 137 \n\nTABLE 6-2. Computing the Classic Orbital Elements.

This angle is the argument o/Iatitude and, when e = 0, equals the angle from \nthe nodal vector to the satellite position vector. Finally, if the orbit is circular and equa-\ntorial, then a single angle, I, or true longitude, specifies the angle between the X-axis \nand the satellite position vector. \n\n6.1.4 Satellite Ground Tracks \n\nAs dermed in Chap. 5, a satellite's ground track is the trace of the points formed by \nthe intersection of the satellite's position vector with the Earth's surface. In this section \nwe will evaluate ground tracks using a flat map of the Earth. Chapters 5 and 7 give \nanother approach of displaying them on a global representation. \n\nAlthough ground tracks are generated from the orbital elements, we can gain \ninsight by determining the orbital elements from a given ground track. Figure .6-4 \nshows ground tracks for satellites with different orbital altitudes ~d, there.fore, ~ffer\u00ad\nent orbital periods. The time it takes Earth to rotate through the difference m longitude \nbetween two successive ascending nodes equals the orbit's period. For direct orbits, in \nwhich the satellite moves eastward, we measure the change positive to the east. For \nretrograde orbits, in which the satellite moves westward, positive is measured to the \nwest.\" With these definitions, the period, P, in minutes is \n\nP = 4( 360 deg - IlL) direct orbit (6-10) \n\nP = 4(1lL - 360 deg) retrograde orbit \n\n-This convenient empirical definition does not apply for near polar orbits: More formally. a \nprograde or direct orbit has i < 90 deg. A retrograde orbit has i > 90 deg. A polar orbit has \n;=90 deg. \n\n\n\n138 Introduction to Astrodynamics 6.1 \n\n(For a more precise rotation rate for the Earth, use 3.988 \u00b7minldeg instead of 4.0 in \nthese equations.) where M. is the change in longitude in degrees that the satellite goes \nthrough between successive ascending nodes. The difference in longitude between \ntwo successive ascending nodes for a direct orbit will always be less than 360 deg, and \nin fact, will be negative for orbits at altitudes higher than geosynchronous altitude. For \nretrograde omits, the difference in longitude between two successive ascending nodes \n(positive change is measured to the west) is always greater than 360 deg. \n\nLongitude \n\nFig. 6-1.

The period of a geosynchronous orbit, E, is 1,436 min, \nmatching the Earth's rotational motion. \n\nWe can determine the orbit's inclination by the ground track's maximum latitude. \nFor direct orbits the inclination equals the ground track's maximum latitude, and for \nretrograde orbits the inclination equals 180 deg minus the ground track's maximum \nlatitude. \n\nThe orbit is circular if a ground track is symmetrical about both the equator and a \nline oflongitude extending downward from the ground track's maximum latitude. All \nthe orbits in Fig. 6-4 are circular. . \n\nFigure 6-5 shows examples of ground tracks for the following typical orbits: \n\nA: Shuttle parking orbit, a = 6,700 km, e = 0, i = 28.4 deg; \nB: Low-altitude retrograde orbit, a = 6,700 km, e = 0, i = 98.0 deg; \n\n6.1 Keplerlan Orbits 139 \n\nc: GPS orbit, a = 26,600 Ian, e = 0, i = 55.0 deg; and \nD: Molniya orbits, a = 26,600 km, e = 0.75, i = 63.4 deg, co = 270 deg. \n\nLongitude \n\nFig. 6-5.

See text for orbital elements. \n\n6.1.5 Time of Flight in an Elliptical Orbit \n\nIn analyzing Brahe's observational data, Kepler was able to solve the pro~lem of \nrelating position in the orbit to the elapsed time, t - to. or conversely, how long It takes \nto go from one point to another in an orbit. To solve this, Kepler introduced the quan-\ntity M, called the mean anomaly, which is the fraction ofan orbit period which has \nelapsed since perigee, expressed as an angle. The mean anomaly equals the true anom-\naly for a circular orbit. By definition, \n\nM - Moen (t- to) (6-12) \n\nwhere Mo is the mean anomaly at time to and n is the mean motion, or average angular \nveloci~. determined from the semimajor axis of the orbit: \n\nn = (Ill a3)112 (6-13) \n:;:; 36,173.585 a-312 deg/s \n\n:;:; 8,681,660.4 a-312 revlday \n\n:;:; 3.125 297 7 x 109a-312 deglday \n\nwhere a is in km. \nThis solution will give the average position and velocity, but satellite orbits are \n\nelliptical, with a radius constantly varying in orbit. Because t~e satellite's velocity \ndepends on this varying radius, it changes as well. To resolve. ~s probl~ we define \nan intermediate variable called eccentric anomaly, E, for elliptical orbits. Table 6-J \nlistS the equations necessary to relate time of flight to orbital position. \n\n\n\n140 Introduction to Astrodymmdcs 6.1 \n\nTABLE 6-3. TIme of flIght In an EllIptIc Orbit.

For this example \n\nVo = EO = Mo = 0.0 rad \nv = 1.5708 rad \nM = 1.3711 rad \nt = 1,271.88 s \n\nto =O.Os \n\nE = 1.4706 rad \nn = 0.001 08 radls \n\nFinding the position in an orbit after a specified period is more complex. For this \nproblem, we calculate the mean anomaly, M, using time of flight and the mean motion \nusing Eq. (6-12). Next, we determine the true anomaly, v, using the series expansion \nshown in Table 6-3, a good approximation for small eccentricity (the error is of the \norder e3). If we need greater accuracy, we must solve the equation in Table 6-3 relating \nmean anomaly to eccentric anomaly. Because this is a transcendental function, we \nmust use an iterative solution to find the eccentric anomaly. after which we can calcu-\nlate the true anomaly directly. \n\n6.1.6 Orbit Determination \n\nUp to this point, we have assumed that we know both the position and velocity of \nthe satellite in inertial space or the classical orbital elements. But we often cannot \ndirectly observe the satellite's inertial position and velocity. Instead, we commonly \nreceive data from radar, telemetry, optics, or GPS. Radar and telemetry data consists \nof range, azimuth, elevation, and possibly the rates of change of one or more of these \nquantities, relative to a site attached to the rotating Earth. GPS receivers give GCI \nlatitude, longitude, and altitude. Optical data consists of right ascension and declina-\ntion relative to the celestial sphere. In any case, we must combine and convert this data \nto inertial position and velocity before determining the orbital elements. Bate Mueller, \nand White [1971] and &cobal [1965] cover methods for combining data, so'I will not \ncover them here. \n\nThe type of data we use for orbit determination depends on the orbit selected, \naccuracy requirements, and weight restrictions on the spacecraft. Because radar and \noptical systems collect data passively, they require no additional spacecraft weight, \nbut they are also the least accurate methods of orbit determination. Conversely, GPS \n\n6.2 Orbit Perturbations 141 \n\ndata is more accmatebut also requires a receiver and processor, which add weight. We \ncan also use GPS for semiautonomous orbit determination because it requires no \nground support. An alternative method for fully autonomous navigation is given by \nTai and Noerdlinger [1989] (See Sec. 11.2.) \n\n6.2 Orbit Perturbations \n\nThe Keplerian orbit discussed above provides an excellent reference, but other \nforces act on the satellite to perturb it away from the nominal orbit We can classify \nthese perturbations, or variations in the orbital elements, based on how they affect the \nKeplerian elements. \n\nFigure 6-6 illustrates a typical variation in one of the orbital elements because of a \nperturbing force. Secular variations represent a linear variation in the element Short-\nperiod variations are periodic in the element with a period less than or equal to the \norbital period. Long-period variations have a period greater than the orbital period. \nBecause secular variations have long-term effects on orbit prediction (the orbital ele-\nments affected continue to increase or decrease), I will discuss them in detail. If the \nsatellite mission demands that we precisely determine the orbit, we must include the \nperiodic variations as well. Battin [1999], Danby [1962], and Escobal [1965] describe \nmethods of determining and predicting orbits for perturbed Keplerian motion. \n\n8ement \n\nOrbit Period \n\n;' \n;' \n\nSecular \n;' \n\n11me \n\nRg. 6-6. Secular and Periodic Variations of an Orbital Element. Secular variations \nrepresenl Onear variations in the element, short-period variations have a period less \nthan the orbital period, and long-period variations have a period longer than the orbital \nperiod. \n\nWhen we consider. perturbing forces, the classical orbital elements vary with time. \nTo predict the orhit we must determine this time variation using techniques of either \n\n\n\n142 Introduction to Astrodynamlcs 6.2 \n\nspecial or general perturbations. Special perturbations employ direct numerical inte-\ngration of the equations of motion. Most common is Cowell's method, in which the \naccelerations are integrated directly to obtain velocity and again to obtain position. \n\nGeneral perturbations analytically solve some aspects of the motion of a satellite \nsubjected to perturbing forces. For example, the polar equation of a conic applies to \nthe two-body equations of motion. Unfortunately, most perturbing forces don't yield \nto a direct analytic solution but to series expansions and approximations. Because the \norbital elements are nearly constant, geneml perturbation techniques usually solve \ndirectly for the orbital elements mther than the inertial position and velocity. The \norbital elements are more difficult to descnbe mathematically and approximate, but \nthey allow us to better understand how perturbations affect a large class of orbits. We \ncan also obtain solutions much faster than with special perturbations. \n\nThe primary forces which perturb a satellite orbit arise from third bodies such as \nthe Sun and the Moon, the non spherical mass distribution of the Earth, atmospheric \ndrag, and solar mdiation pressure. We describe each of t1!ese below. \n\n6.2.1 Third-Body Perturbations \n\nThe gravitational forces of the Sun and the Moon cause periodic variations in all of \nthe orbital elements, but only the right ascension of the ascending node, argument of \nperigee, and mean anomaly experience secular variations. These secular variations \narise from a gyroscopic precession of the orbit about the ecliptic pole. The secular vari-\nation in mean anomaly is much smaller than the mean motion and has little effect on \nthe orbit; however, the secular variationS in right ascension of the ascending node and \nargument of perigee are important, especially for high-altitude orbits. \n\nFor nearly circular orbits, e2 is almost zero and the resulting error is of the order e2. \nIn this case, the equations for the secular mtes of change resulting from the Sun and \nMoon are: \n\n\u2022 Right ascension of the ascending node: \n\nnMOON =-0.00338 (cosi)/n \nnSUN = -0.00154 (cosi) I n \n\n\u2022 Argument of perigee: \n\no,MOON = 0.00169(4':\"5 sin2 i)1 n \n\no,SUN = 0.000 77(4-5 sin2 i)1 n \n\n(6-14) \n\n(6-15) \n\n(6-16) \n\n(6-17) \n\nwhere i is the orbital inclination, n is the number of orbit revolutions per day, and iJ \nand OJ are in deglday. These equations are only approximate; they neglect the varia-\ntion caused. by the changing orientation of the orbital plane with respect to both the \nMoon's orbital plane and the ecliptic plane. \n\n6.2.2 Perturbations Because of a Nonspherical Earth \nWhen developing the two-body equations of motion, we assumed the Earth has a \n\nspherically symmetric mass distnbution. In fact, the Earth has a bulge at the equator, \n\nOrbit Perturbations 143 \n\na slight pear shape, and flattening at the poles. We can find a satellite's acceleration \nby taking the gmdient of the gravitational potential function, tP. One widely used form \nof the geopotential function is: \n\n(6-18) \n\nwhere J.t =GMis Earth's gravitational constant, RE is Earth's equatorial mdius, P.a are \nLegendre polynomials, L is geocentric latitude, and.1;, are dimensionless geopotential \ncoefficients of which the first ~ are: \n\nJ2 = 0.00108263 \nJ3 = -0.000 002 54 \nJ4 = -0.000 001 61 \n\nThis form of the geopotential function depends on latitude, and we call the geo-\npotential coefficients,.1;\" zonal coefficients. Other, more general expressions for the \ngeopotential include sectoral and tesseral terms in the expansion. The sectoral terms \ndivide the Earth into slices and depend only on longitude. The tesseral terms in the \nexpansion represent sections that depend on longitude and latitude. They divide the \nEarth into a checkerboard pattern of regions that alternately add to and subtmct from \nthe two-body potential. A geopotential model consists of a matrix of coefficients in the \nspherical harmonic expansion. The widely used Goddard Earth Model lOB, or \nGEMlOB, is called a \"21 x2l model\" because it consists of a 21 x21 matrix of c0-\nefficients. In order to achieve high accumcy mapping of the ocean surface and wave \nproperties, the TOPEX mission required creating a 100 x 100 geopotential model. \n\nThe potential genemted by the nonspherical Earth causes periodic variations in all \nof the orbital elements. The dominant effects, however, are secular variations in right \nascension of the ascending node and argument of perigee because of the Earth's \noblateness, represented by the 12 term in the geopotential expansion. The mtes of \nchange of .Q and ro due to 12 are \n\n.Q\nJ2 \n\n=-1.5nJ2 (RE I ai(cosi)(l-e\n2)-2 (6-19) \n\n== -2.064 74x 1014 a-712(cosi)(1-e2)-2 \n\nWJ\n2 \n\n=0.75nJ2 (RE I a)2(4-5sin\n2 i)(1-e2)-2 (6-20) \n\n== 1.032 37x1014 a-712 (4-5 sin2 i) (l_e2)-z \n\nwhere n is mean motion in deg/day, RE is Earth's equatorial mdius, a is semimajor axis \nin km, e is eccentricity, i is inclination, and iJ and w are in deg/day. Table 6-4 \ncompares the rates of change of right ascension of the ascending node and argument \nof perigee resulting from the Earth's oblateness, the Sun, and the Moon. For satellites \nin GEO and below, the J2 perturbations dominate; for satellites above GEO the Sun \nand Moon perturbations dominate. \n\nMolniya orbits are highly eccentric (e == 0.75) with approximately 12 hour periods \n(2 revolutions/day). Orbit designers choose the orbital inclination sO the rate of cbange \nof perigee, Eq. (6-20). is zero. This condition occurs at inclinations of 63.4 deg and \n116.6 deg. For these orbits we typically place perigee in the Southern Hemisphere, so \n\n\n\n144 Introduction to Astrodynamics \n\nTABLE 6-4. Secular Variations In Right Ascension of the Ascending Node and Argument \nof Perigee. Note that these secular variations form the basis for Sun-synchronous \nand Molniya orbits.

Mission planners choose perigee altitude to meet the satellite's mission \nconstraints. Typical perigee altitudes vary from 200 to 1,000 km. We can calculate the \neccentricity and apogee altitude using the semimajor axis, perigee altitude, and equa-\ntions from Table 6-2. \n\nIn a Sun-synchronous orbit, the satellite orbital plane remains approximately fixed \nwith respect to the Sun. We do this by matching the secular variation in the right \nascension of the ascending node (Eq. 6-19) to the Earth's rotation rate around the Sun. \nA nodal precession rate of 0.9856 deglday will match the Earth's average rotation rate \nabout the Sun. Because this rotation is positive, Sun-synchronous orbits must be \nretrograde. For a given semimajor axis, a, and eccentricity, we can use Eq. (6-19) to \nfind the inclination for the orbit to be Sun-synchronous. \n\n6.2.3 Perturbations From Atmospheric Drag \n\nThe principal nongravitational force acting on satellites in low-Earth orbit is \natmospheric drag. Drag acts in the opposite direction of the velocity vector and \nremoves energy from the orbit. This energy reduction causes the orbit to get smaller, \n\nOrbit Perturbations 145 \n\nleading to further increases in drag. Eventually, the altitude of the orbit becomes so \nsmall that the satellite reenters the atmosphere. \n\nThe equation for acceleration due to drag on a satellite is: \n\naD = -(1/2)p (CD AI m)VZ (6-21) \n\nwhere p is atmospheric density; A is the satellite's cross-sectional area, m is the satel-\nlite's mass, V is the satellite's velocity with respect to the atmosphere, and CD is the \ndrag coefficient ~ 2.2 (See Table 8-3 in Sec. 8.1.3 for an extended discussion of CD). \n\nWe can approximate the changes in semimajor axis and eccentricity per revolution, \nand the lifetime of a satellite, using the following equations: \n\nl:J.arev = -21t (CDAlm)a2 Pp exp (-c) [10 + 2eItl \n~rev = -21t (CDAlm)a Pp exp (-c) [I) + e (/0 +/2)12] \n\n(6-22) \n(6-23) \n\nwhere p. is atmospheric density at perigee, c == ae / H, H is density scide height (see \ncolumn 25, Inside Rear Cover), and Ii are Modified Bessel Functions\u00b7 of order; and \nargument c. We model the term m I (CDA),or ballistic coeffici~nt, as a constan~ f?r \nmost satellites, although it can vary by a factor .of 10 depend10g on the satelhte s \norientation (see Table 8-3) . \n\nFor near circular orbits, we can use the above equations to derive the much simpler \nexpressions: \n\nl:J.arw = -21t (CDA/m)pa2 \nM'rw= -fJ1t2 (CDAlm)pa2 /V \n\nAV Tel' = 1t (CDAlm)pa V \n\nAerev = 0 \nwhere P is orbital period and V is satellite velocity. \n\nA rough estimate of the satellite's lifetime, L, due to drag is \nL~-HIAa,.ev \n\n(6-24) \n\n(6-25) \n\n(6-26) \n(6-27)\u00b7 \n\n(6-28) \n\nwhere, as above, H is atmospheric density scale height given in column 25 o~the Earth \nSatellite Parameter tables in the back of this book. We can obtain a substantially more \naccurate estimate (although still very approximate) by integrating Eq. (6-24), ~i~g \ninto account the changes in atmospheric density with both altitude and solar actlVlty \nlevel. We did this for representative values of the ballistic coefficient in Fig. 8-4 in \nSec. 8.1. \n\n6.2.4 Perturbations from Solar Radiation \nSolar radiation pressure causes periodic variations in all of the orbital elements. Its \n\neffect is strongest for satellites with low ballisti~ coefficients, that is: light v~hicle~ \nwith large frontal areas such as Echo. The magmtude of the acceleration, aR' 10 mls \narising from solar radiation pressure is \n\naR~-4.5 x 1ij-6(1 +r)Alm (6-29) \n\nwhere A is the satellite cross-sectional area exposed to the Sun in m2 , m is the satellite \nmass in kg, and r is a reflection factor. (r = 0 for absorption; r = I for specular \n\n\u2022 Values for I, can be found in many standard mathematical tables. \n\n\n\n146 Introduction to Astrodynamlcs 6.3 \n\nreflection at nonnal incidence; and r := 0.4 for diffuse reflection.) Below 800 krn \naltitude, acceleration from drag is greater than that from solar radiation pressme; \nabove 800 kIn, acceleration from solar radiation pressure is greater. \n\n6.3 Orbit Maneuvering \n\nAt some point during the lifetime of most satellites, we must change one or more \nof the orbital elements. For example, we may need to transfer it from an initial parking \norbit to the final mission orbit, rendezvous with or intercept another satellite, or correct \nthe orbital elements to adjust for the perturbations discussed in the previous section. \nMost frequently, we must change the orbital altitude, plane, or both. To change the \norbit of a satellite, we have to change the satellite's velocity vector in magnitude or \ndirection using a thruster. Most propulsion systems operate for only a short time com-\npared to the orbital period, so we can treat the maneuver as an impulsive change in the \nvelocity while the position remains fixed For this reason, any maneuver changing the \norbit ofa satellite must occur at a point where the old orbit intersects the new orbit If \nthe two orbits do not intersect, we must use an intennediate orbit that intersects both. \nIn this case, the total maneuver requires at least two propulsive burns. \n\nIn general, the change in the velocity vector to go from one orbit to another is \ngiven by \n\nAV = V NEED - VCURRENT (~30) \n\nWe can find the current and needed velocity vectors from the orbital elements, \nkeeping in mind that the position vector does not change significantly during impul-\nsive burns. \n\n6.3.1 Coplanar Orbit Transfers \nThe most common type of in-plane maneuver changes the size and energy of the \n\norbit, usually from a low-altitude parking orbit to a higher-altitude mission orbit such \nas a geosynchronous orbit. Because the initial and final orbits do not intersect (see \nFig. ~ 7), the maneuver requires a transfer orbit. Figure ~ 7 represents a Hohmann\" \nTransfer Orbit. In this case, the transfer orbit's ellipse is tangent to both the initial and \nfinal circular orbits at the transfer orbit's perigee and apogee, respectively. The orbits \nare tangential, so the velocity vectors are collinear at the intersection points, and the \nHohmann Transfer represents the most fuel-efficient transfer between two circular, \ncoplanar orbits. When transferring from a smaller orbit to a larger orbit, the propulsion \nsystem must apply velocity change in the direction of motion; when transferring from \na larger orbit to a smaller, the velocity change is opposite to the direction of motion. \n\nThe total velocity change required for the transfer is the sum of the velocity changes \nat perigee and apogee of the transfer ellipse. Because the velocity vectors are collinear \nat these points, the velocity changes are just the differences in magnitudes of the \nvelocities in each orbit. We can find these differences from the energy equation, if we \nknow the size of each orbit. If we know the initial and final orbits (rA and rB)' we \ncalculate the semimajor axis of the transfer ellipse, a/X9 and the total velocity change \n\n\u2022 Walter Hohmann. a Gennan engineer and architect, wrote The Attainability o/Celestial Dodier \n[1925), consisting of a mathematical discussion of the conditions for leaving and returning \nto Earth. \n\n6.3 \n\nAnal Orbit \n\nInitial Orbit \n\nOrbit Maneuvering \n\nHohmann \nTransfer \n\nEDipse. \n\n147 \n\nA~ 6-7.

The Hohmann Transfer ellipse provides orbit transfer between \ntwo circular, co-planar orbits. \n\n(the sum of the velocity changes required at points A and B) using the following \nalgorithm. An example transferring from an initial circular orbit of 6,567 km to a finaI \ncircular orbit of 42, 160 km illustrates this technique. \n\nSTEP EQUATIONS EXAMPLE \n\n1. a/X =(rA+ rB)/2 =24,364km \n\n2. fiA = (Jl/'A)112 = 63 1.348 I {'A r-112 =7.79km1s \n3. ~ = (JlI rB )112 \n\n= 63 1.348 I {rar-l12 = 3.08 kmls \n\n4.

Time of transfer = PI2 =5hr 15 min \n\n\n\n148 Introdnction to Astrodynamics 6.3 \n\nAlternatively, we can write the total LlY required for a two-bum transfer between circular \norbits at radii rA and r8: \n\nl!.VTOTAL is l!.JA + l!.Va (6-31) \n\n(6-32) \n\nwhere .JP =631.3481 whenl!.Vis in kmls and all of the semimajoraxesare in km. As in step I \nabove, alr=(r\" + r8)12. \n\nThe above expression applies to any coplanar Hohmann transfer. In the case of small transfers \n(that is, fA close to r8), we can approximate this conveniently in two forms: \n\nwhere \n\nand \n\nl!.V '\" VIA - VJB \n\nl!.V lOS 0.5 (l!.r / r) VA/8 \n(6-33) \n\n(6-34) \n\n(6-35) \n\n(6-36) \n\nTo make the orbit change, we divide the l!.V into two small burns are of approximately equal \nmagnitude. \n\nThe result in Eq. (6-33) is more unusual than it might seem at first. Assume that a satellite is \nin a circular orbit with velocity V;A. In two burns we increase the velocity by an amount l!.Y. The \nresult is that the satellite is higher and traveling slower than originally by the amount l!.V. We \ncan best clarifY this result by an example. Consider a satellite initially in a circular orbit at \n400 km such that rA = 6,778 km and V;A = 7,700 mls. We will apply a totall!.Vof20 mls (= 0.26% \nof JiA) in two burns of 10 mls each. From Eq. (6-34) the totall!.rw'ill 000.52% of 6,778 km or \n35 km. Thus, the final orbit will be circular at an altitude of 6,813 km. Immediately following \nthe first burn of 10 mls the spacecraft will be at perigee of the transfer orbit with a velocity of \n7,710 mls. When the spacecraft reaches apogee at 6,813 km it will have slowed according to \nKepler's second law by 0.52% to 7,670 mls. We then apply the second bum of 10 mls to circu-\nlarize the orbit at 7,680 mls which is 20 mls slower than its original velocity. We have added \nenergy to the spacecraft which has raised the orbit and resulted in a lower kinetic energy but \nsufficiently more potential energy to make up for both the reduced speed and the added l!. V. \n\nSometimes, we may need to transfer a satellite between orbits in less time than that. \nrequired to complete the Hohmann transfer. Figure 6-8 shows a faster transfer called \nthe one-tangent burn. In this instance the transfer orbit is tangential to the initial orbit \nIt intersects the final orbit at an angle equal to the flight-path angle of the transfer orbit \nat the point of intersection. An infinite number of transfer orbits are tangential to the \ninitial orbit and intersect the final orbit at some angle. Thus, we may choose the trans-\nfer orbit by specifying the size of the transfer orbit, the angular change of the transfer, \nor the time required to complete the transfer. We can then define the transfer orbit and \ncalculate the required velocities. \n\nFor example, we may specifY the size of the transfer orbit, choosing any semimajor \naxis that is greater than the semimajor axis of the Hohmann transfer e11ipse. Once we \nknow the semimajor axis of the e11ipse (air)' we can calcufate the eccentricity, angular \ndistance traveled in the transfer, the velocity change required for the transfer, arid the \ntime required to complete the transfer using the equations in Table 6-5. \n\n6.3 Orbit Maneuvering 149 \n\nTransfer 8IIpse \n\nFig. 6-8.

This maneuver requires a \ncomponent of t\\ V to be perpendicular to the orbital plane and, therefore, perpendicular \nto the initial velocity vector. If the size of the orbit remains constant, we call the \nmaneuver a simple plane change (Fig. 6-9A). We can find the required change in \nvelocity by using the law of cosines. For the case in which T'J is equal to Jj, this \nexpression reduces to \n\nt\\V= 2Jj sin (6/2) (6-38) \n\nwhere Jj is the velocity before and after the burn, and 6 is angle change required. \n\n~v ~ \nv, V, \n\nA. Simple Plane Change B. Combined Plane Change \n\nFig. 6-9. Vector Representation of Simple and Combined Changes In Orbital Plene. For \nthe simple plane change, the magnitude of initial and final velocities are equal. \n\nFor example, the change in velocity required to transfer from a low-altitude \n(h = 185 Ian) inclined (i = 28 deg) orbit to an equatorial orbit (i= 0) at the same altitude \nis: \n\nr=6,563 Ian v,= 7.79 kmls t\\V= 3.77 kmls \nFrom Eq. (6-38) we see that if the angular change equals 60 deg, the required \n\nchange in velocity equals the current velocity. Plane changes are very expensive in \nterms of the required velocity change and resulting fuel consumption. To minimize \nthis, we should change the plane at a point where the velocity of the satellite is a \nminimum: at apogee for an elliptical orbit In some cases, it may even be cheaper to \nboost the satellite into a higher orbit, change the orbital plane at apogee, and return the \nsatellite to its original orbit \n\n6.3 Orbit Maneuvering 151 \n\nTypically, orbital transfers require changes in both the size and the plane of the \norbit, such as transferring from an inclined parking orbit at low altitude to a zero- ' \ninclination orbit at geosynchronous altitude. We do this transfer in two steps: a \nHohmann transfer to change the size of the orbit and a simple plane change to make \nthe orbit equatorial. A more efficient method (less total change in velocity) would be \nto combine the plane change with the tangential burn at apogee of the transfer orbit \n(Fig. 6-98). As we must change both the magnitude and direction of the velocity \nvector, we can find the required change in velocity using the law of cosines: \n\n(6-39) \n\nwhere Jj is the initial velocity, T'Jis the final velocity, and 6 is the angle change \nrequired. \n\nFor example, we find the total change in velocity to transfer from Ii Shuttle parking \norbit to a geosynchronous equatorial orbit as follows: \n\nrj = 6,563 km rf = 42,159 Ian \ni;=28 deg \n\nV, = 7.79 kmls \nt\\y;' = 2.46 kmls \n\nt\\VTOTAL = 4.29 km/s \n\n~=Odeg \n\n~ = 3.08 kmls \n\nMa = 1.83 kmls \n\nCompleting a Hohmann transfer followed by a simple plane change would require \na velocity change of 5.44 km/s, so the Hohmann transfer with a combined plane \nchange at apogee of the transfer orbit represents a savings of 1.15 km/s. As we see \nfrom Eq. (6-39), a small plane change (6 ~ 0) can be combined with an energy change \nfor almost no cost in t\\V or propellant. Consequently, in practice, we do geosyn-\nchronous transfer with a small plane change at perigee and most of the plane change \nat apogee. \n\nAnother option is to complete the maneuver using three bums. The first burn is a \ncoplanar maneuver placing the sateJlite into a transfer orbit with an apogee much \nhigher than the final orbit. When the satellite reaches apogee of the transfer orbit, it \ndoes a combined plane change maneuver. This places the satellite in a second transfer \norbit which is coplanar with the final orbit and has a perigee altitude equal to the \naltitude of the final orbit. Finally, when the satellite reaches perigee of the second \ntransfer orbit, another coplanar maneuver places the satellite into the final orbit. This \nthree-bum maneuver may save fuel, but the fuel savings comes at the expense of the \ntotal time required to complete the maneuver. \n\n6.3.3 Orbit Rendezvous \n\nOrbital transfer becomes more complicated when the objective is to rendezvous \nwith or intercept another object in space: both the interceptor and target must arrive at \nthe rendezvous point at the same time. This precise timing demands a phasing orbit to \naccomplish the maneuver. A phasing orbit is any orbit which results in the interceptor \nachieving the desired geometry'relative to the target to initiate a Hohmann transfer. If \nthe initial and final orbits are circular, coplanar, and of different sizes, then the phasing \norbit is simpiy the initial interceptor orbit (Fig. 6-10). The interceptor remains in the \ninitial orbit until the relative motion between the interceptor and target results in the \n\n\n\n152 Introduction to Astrodynamics 6.3 \n\ndes!red geometr.r. At that point, we inject the interceptor into a Hohmann transfer \nOrbit. The equation to solve for the wait time in the initial orbit is: \n\nWait Time = (~; - ~f + 2kn;) 1(W;nr - C4gt} (6-40) \n\nwhere ~fis the phase angle (angular separation of target and interceptor) needed for \nrendezvous, ~i is the i~itial phase an~le, k is the number of rendezvous opportunities \n(for the first Opportunity, k = 0), Wln,IS the angular velocity of the interceptor: and ro ' \nis the angul~ veloci~ of the target. We calculate the lead angle, aL' by m~ltipIYi~g \nwtgt by the time of flight for the Hohmann transfer and ~f is 180 deg minus aL' \n\nFig. 6-10. Geometry Depicting Rendezvous Between Two Circular, Coplanar Orbits. The \nphase angle is the angular separation between the target and interceptor at the start \nof the rendezvous and the lead angle is the distance the target travels from the start \nuntil rendezvous occurs. \n\n. The total time to rendezvous equals the wait time from Eq. (6-40) plus the time of \nflight of the Hohmann transfer orbit. \n\nThe denominator in Eq. (6-40) represents the relative motion between the inter-\ncep~or and t~et. As ~e size of the interceptor orbit approaches the size of the target \nOrbit, th~ relative motion approaches zero! and the wait time approaches infinity. If the \ntwo Orbits are .exactly the same, then the mterceptor must enter a new phasing orbit to \nrendezvous WIth the target (Fig. 6- I I). For this situation, the rendezvous occurs at the \npoint when: the .interceptor enter:s the phasing orbit. The period of the phasing orbit \n~ the time It takes the target to get to the rendezvous point. Once we know the \n~od, we c::an calculate the s:mimajor ax.is. The two orbits are tangential at their point \nof m~on, so .the v~loci1y c~ange IS the difference in magnitudes of the two \nVelOCities at the pomt of mtersectlon of the two orbits. Because we know the size of \nthe orbits, and therefore, the energies, we can use the energy Eq. (6-4) to solve for the \ncur:rent and needed velocities. \n\nFrequently oper:ator:s must adjust the relative phasing for satellites in circular orbits. \nThey accomplish this by making the satellite drift relative to its initial position. The \ndrift rate in deg/orbit is given by \n\n6.4 Launch Windows 153 \n\nA. Interceptor slightly behind target: \nInterceptor \n\nB. Interceptor slightly ahead of target: \nInterceptor \n\nFig. 6-11. Rendezvous from Same Orbit Showing the Target both Leading and Trailing \nthe Interceptor. \n\ndrift rate = 1,080 ~VIV (6-41) \n\nwhere V is the nominal orbital velocity and ~ V is the velocity change required to start \nor stop the drift. \n\nThe techniques described above move the target vehicle close to the interceptor. \nOnce the two vehicles are close to each other they begin proximity operations by solv-\ning a set of relative motion equations to achie:ve the final rendezvous. VaIlado [1997] \ncontains an excellent discussion of the solution to the nearby relative motion problem, \nas addressed by the Clohessy-Wiltshire or Hill's equations of relative motion. \n\n6.4\u00b7 Launch Windows \n\nSimilar to the rendezvous problem is the launch-window problem, or determining \nthe appropriate time to launch from the surface of the Earth into the desired orbital \nplane. Because the orbital plane is fixed in inertial space, the launch window is the \ntime when the launch site on the surface of the Earth rotates thfough th~ orbital plane. \nAs Fig. 6-12 shows, the launch time depends on the launch site's latitude and longi-\ntude and the satellite orbit's inclination and right ascension of the ascending node. \n\nFor a launch window to exist, the launch site must pass throUWt the orbital plane. \nThis requirement places restrictions on the orbital inclinations, i, possible from a \ngiven launch latitude, L: \n\n\u2022 No launch windows exist if L > i for direct orbit or L > 180 deg - i for \nretrograde orbits. \n\n\u2022 One launch window exists if L = i or L = 180 deg - i. \n\n\u2022 Two launch windows exist if L < i or L < 180 deg - i. \n\nThe launch azimuth, 13, is the angle measured clockwise from nor:th to the velocity \nvector. If a launch window exists, then the launch azimuth required to achieve an \ninclination, i, from a given launch latitude, L, is given by: \n\n\n\n154 Introduction to Astrodynamics 6.4 \n\nFig. 6-12. Launch Window Geometry for Launches near the Ascending Node (1) and \nDescending Node (2). The angles shown are the orbital IncDnation (/), launch site \nlatitude (L), and launch azimuth <fJ). \n\n(6-42a) \nwhere \n\nsin PI = cos i I cos L (6-42b) \nand \n\n(6-42c) \n\nwhere VL is tile inertial velocity of the launch site given by Eq. (6-46) below, \nVeq = 464.5 mls is the velocity of Earth's rotation at the equator, and Vo \"\" 7.8 kmls is \nthe velocity of the satellite immediately after launch. PI is the inertial launch azimuth \nand r is a small correction to account for the velocity contribution caused by Earth's \nrotation. For launches to low-Earth orbit, r ranges from 0 for a due east launch to 3.0 \ndeg for launch into a polar orbit The approximation for r in Eq. (6-42c) is accurate to \nwithin 0.1 deg for low-Earth orbits. For launches near the ascending node, P is in the \nfirst or fourth quadrant and the plus sign applies in Eq. (6-42a). For launches near the \ndescending node, P is in the second or third quadrant and the minus sign applies in \nEq. (6-42a). \n\nLet 0, shown in Fig. 6-12, be the angle in the equatorial plane from the nearest node \nto the longitude of the launch site. We can determine 0 from: \n\ncos 0 = cos P Isin i (6-43) \nwhere 0 is positive for direct orbits and negative for retrogradC? orbits. Fmally, the local \nsidereal time, LST, of launch is the angle from the vernal equinox to the longitude of \nthe launch site at the time of launch: \n\nLST = .Q + 0 (launch at the ascending node) \n= .Q + 180 deg - 0 (launch at the descending node) (6-44) \n\nwhere .Q is the right ascension of the ascending nooe of the resulting orbit \n\n6.5 Orbit Maintenance ISS \n\nHaving calculated the launch azimuth required to achieve the desired orbit, we can \nnow calculate the velocity needed to accelerate the payload from rest at the launch site \nto the required burnout velocity. To do so, we use topocentric-horizon coordinates \nwith velocity components Vs, VE, Vz: \n\nVs = -Ji\" cos q, cos Pb \nVE = Vbo cos q, sin f3b - VL \nVz = Vbo sin q, \n\n(6-45a) \n\n(6-45b) \n\n(6-45c) \n\nwhere V bo is the velocity at burnout (usually equal to the circular orbital velocity at the \nprescribed altitude), q, is the flight path angle at burnout, fJb is the launch azimuth at \nburnout, and VL is the velocity of the launch site at a given latitude, L, as given by: \n\nVL = (464.5 mls) cos L (6-46) \n\nEquations (6-45c) do not include losses in the velocity of the launch vehicle be-\ncause of atmospheric drag and gravity-approximately 1,500 mls for a typical launch \nvehicle. A]so, in Eq. (6-45c) Vie assume that the azimuth at launch and the azimuth at \nburnout are the same. Changes in the latitude and longitude of the launch vehicle \nduring powered flight will introduce small errors into the calculation of the burnout \nconditions. We can calculate the velocity required at burnout from the energy eqUation \nif we know the semimajor axis and radius of burnout of the orbit [Eq. (6-4\u00bb). \n\n6.5 Orbit Maintenance \n\nOnce in their mission orbits, many satellites need no additional orbital adjustments. \nOn the other hand, mission requirements may demand that we maneuver the sateJJite \nto correct the orbital elements when perturbing forces.have changed them. Two par-\nticular cases of note are satellites with repeating ground tracks and geosynchronous \nequatorial satellites, placed at an assigned longitude. \n\nUsing two-body equations of motion, we can show that a satellite wiJI have a \nrepeating ground track if it has exactly an integer number of revolutions per integer \nnumber of days. Its period, therefore, must be: \n\np= (m sidereal days) I (krevolutions) (6-47) \n\nwhere m and k are integers, and 1 sidereal day = ],436.068 167 min. For example, a \nsatellite orbiting the Earth exactly 16 times per day bas a period of 89.75 min and a \nsemimajor axis of 6,640 km. \n\nNext we would modiry the period of the satellite to account for the drift in the \norbital plane caused by the Earth's ob]ateness (J2). We can calculate the change in the \nright ascension of the ascending node, MJ, because of J2\u2022 fro~ the two-body orbital \nelements. In this case the new period is: \n\nP NEW = P TWO BODY + lUJ/coEartb (6-48) \nBecause we base the nodal drift on the two-body orbital elements, we must iterate \n\nto find the new orbital period and semimajor axis. Continuing with the previous exam-\nple. assume a perigee altitude of 120 Ian and an inclination of 45 deg. In this case, we \nfind that the cO!Dpensated period is 88.20 min and the new semimajor axis is 6,563 km. \n\nSeveral examples of spacecmft placed in orbits with repeating ground tracks are \nshown in Table 6-7. \n\n\n\n156 Introduction to Astrodynamlcs 6.S \n\nTABLE 6-7. Examples of Repeating Ground Tracks. \n\nSatellite Inclination (deg) SemImaJor Axis <k!n) Revs Days \nSEASAT 108.0 7,169.0 43 3 \nLANDSAT 415 98.2 7,On.7 233 16 \nGEOSAT 108.05 7,162.7 244 17 \n\nThe Earth's oblateness also causes the direction of perigee to rotate around the \norbit. If the orbit is noncircular and the mission places limits on the altitude over \nspecific targets, we must control the location of perigee. One possibility is to select the \ninclination of the orbit to be at the critical inclination (63.4 deg for a direct orbit and \n116.4 deg for a retrograde orbit), so the location of perigee is fixed. If other constraints \nmake this selection impossible, we must maintain the orbit through orbital maneuvers. \nWe can change the location of perigee by changing the flight-path angle by an angle \n9. Only the direction of the velocity vector changes, so we can find the change in ve-\nlocity from the equation for a simple plane change: \n\nL1V=2Vsin 912 (6-49) \n\nA final consideration for a low-altitude orbit with repeating ground tracks is the \nchange in the semimajor axis and eccentricity due to atmospheric drag. Drag causes \nthe orbit to become smaller. As the orbit becomes smaller, the period also decreases, \ncausing the ground track to appear to shift eastward. If we specify some tolerance, \nsuch as a maximum distance between the actual and desired ground tracks, the satellite \nmust periodically maneuver to maintain the desired orbit. \n\nWe can use Eq. (6-22) to calculate the change in semimajor axis per revolution of \nthe orbit. Given the change in the size of the orbit, we can also determine the change \nin the period: \n\n!lP = 37t /la/(na) (6-50) \nIf constraints exist for either the period or semimajor axis of the orbit, we can use \n\nEqs. (6-22) and (6-50) to keep track of the period and semimajor axis until we need to \ncorrect the orbit. We can apply a tangential velocity change at perigee to adjust the \nsemimajor axis when required. Again, we can find the current and needed velocities \nfrom the energy Eq. (6-4), because we know the size, and therefore the energy, of the \ntwo orbits. \n\nGeosynchronous equatorial orbits also require orbital maintenance maneuvers. Sat-\nellites in these orbits drift when perturbations occur from the nonsphericaI Earth and \nfrom the third-body gravitational attraction of the Sun and Moon. Matching the period \nof a geostationary orbit with the Earth's rotational velocity results in a resonance with \nthe .In term in the geopotential. This resonance term results in a transverse accelera-\ntion, that is, an acceleration in the plane of the orbit. This causes the satellite to drift in \nlongitude (Bast-West drift). The Sun and the ~oon cause out-of-plane accelerations \nwhich make the satellite drift in latitude (North-South drift). \n\nNorth-south stationkeeping is necessary when mission requirements limit inclina-\ntion drift. If not corrected, the inclination oftbe orbit varies between 0 and 15 deg with \na period of approximately 55 years. The approximate equations to solve for the worst-\ncase change in velocity are: \n\n6.5 Orbit Maintenance \n\nL1 VMOON = 102.67 cos a sin a (mlsIyr) \n= 36.93 mls per year, for i = 0 \n\nL1VSUN = 40.17 cos rsin r(mlsIyr) \n\n= 14.45 mls/yr, for i = 0 \n\n157 \n\n(6-51) \n\n(6-52) \n\nwhere a is the angle between the orbital plane and the Moon's orbit, and ris the angle \nbetween the orbital and ecliptic plane. . . . \n\nThe transverse acceleration caused by resonance WIth the .Tn term results m pen-\nodic motion about either of two stable longitudes at appr?~ly:5 deg and 25~ deg \nEast longitude. If we place a satellite at any other longttude, It will tend to orbit ~e \nclosest of these two longitudes, resulting in East-West ~ of up to ~80 de~ WIth \nperiods of up to 900 days. Suppose a mission for a geostationary satellite ~es a \nrequired longitude, lD' The change in velocity required to. com~te for the drift and \nmaintain the satellite in the vicinity of the specified longttude IS: \n\nL1V= 1.715 sin (2 lID - l.b (6-53) \nwhere 1 is the desired longitude, 1 is the closest stable longitude, and L1 Vis in mis/yr. \n\nFor ~xample, we find the vel~ity change required for one year if the desired lon-\ngitude is 60 deg west as \n\nlD =-60deg l.=255 deg \n\nL1V = 1.715 mlS/yr \n\nAfter the mission of the satellite is complete, several options exist, depending on \nthe orbit. We may allow low-altitude orbits to decay and reenter the ~tmosphere?I\" use \na velocity change to speed up the process. Vf~ may also ~st sa~llites ~t all altitudes \ninto benign orbits to reduce the probability of collisIOn WIth active paylo~, \nespecially at synchronous altitudes or when the sa~lIite is part of a large constellation. \nBecause coplanar velocity changes are more effiCIent than plane changes, we would \nnormally apply tangential changes in velocity. Their ma~tud~ would depend on the \ndifference in energy of the two orbits. Generally, a change m altitude of a few hundred \nkilometers is sufficient to prevent collisions within a constellation. If we increase the \naltitude of the orbit for disposal, we must make sure atmospheric drag does not cause \nthe disposal orbit to decay and return the spacecraft to the original a1ti~de of the co~\u00ad\nstellation. If we choose to deorbit our satellite, the velocity change required to deorbit \na satellite in a circular orbit at initial altitude, HI' and velocity, V, is: \n\n(6-54a) \n\n(6-54b) \n\nwhere R is the radius of the Earth and He is the perigee altitude at the end of the bum. \nIt is got necessary to reduce perigee altitude to 0 km. Choosing a 50 km deorbit \n\naltitude would reduce the FireSat L1Vdeorbit to 183 mls. Note that we reduce only \n\n\n\n158 Introduction to Astrodyuamics 6.5 \n\nperigee in the deorbit\"bum. Reducing perigee to 100 to 150 Ion could result in several \norbits over which apogee decreases before the spacecraft reenters and might not allow \nadequate contrcI of the deorbit conditions. \n\nReferences \n\nBate, Roger R., Donald D.

In contrast, this chapter deals with select-\ning or designing orbits to meet the largest number of mission requirements at the least \npossible cost. The orbit selection process is complex, involving trades between a \nnumber of different parameters. The orbit typically defines the space mission lifetime, \ncost, environment, viewing geometry, and, frequently, the payload performance. Most \ncommonly, we must trade the velocity required to achieve the orbit as a measure of \ncost vs. coverage performance. \n\nChapter 6 lists several references on astrodynamics. Unfortunately, very few of \nthese references contain any discussion of the orbit selection or design process. \nChobotov [1996] and Vallado [1997] have some information. By far the most exten-\nsive discussion of this topic is in Wertz [2001]. Soop [1994] contains an excellent \ndiscussion of the design of geostationary orbits. \n\nOrdinarily, spacecraft will be in various orbits during the space mission life. These \ncould include, for example, a parking orbit for spacecraft checkout or storage, a \ntransfer orbit to move it from the injection orbit where the spacecr.aft separated from \nthe launch vehicle to its operational orbit or orbits for mission activities, and possibly \na finaI disposal orbit where the spacecraft will do minimum damage when we are \nthrough using it. In early mission design, we pay most attention to defining the space-\ncraft's operational orbit. However, preliminary mission design needs to consider aU \nmission phases to meet the needs of more complex missions. \n\n159 \n\n\n\n160 Orbit and CODSteDatiOD Design 7.1 \n\n7.1 The Orbit Design Process \n\nOrbit design has no absolute rules; the method described below and summarized in \nTable 7-1 gives a starting point and checklist for the process. \n\nTABLE 7-1.

Document orbit parameters, selectIon criteria, and allowed ranges. \nIterate as needed. \n\nEffective orbit design requires clearly identifying the reasons for orbit selection. \nreviewing these reasons regularly as mission requirements change or mission defini-\ntion improves, and continuing to remain open to alternatives. Several different designs \nmay be credible. Thus, communications may work effectively through a single large \nsatellite in geosynchronous orbit or a constellation of small satellites in low-Earth \norbit. We may need to keep both options for some time before selecting one. \n\nStep 1. Establish Orbit Types \n\nTo design orbits we first divide the space mission into segments and classify each \nsegment by its overall function. Each orbit segment has different selection criteria, so \nwe evaluate it separately, placing it into one of the four basic types: \n\n\u2022 Parking Orbit-a temporary orbit which provides a safe and convenient \nlocation for satellite checkout. storage between operations, or at end-of-life. \nAlso used to match conditions between phases such as post-launch and pre-\norbit transfer. \n\n\u2022 Transfer Orbit-used for getting from place to place. Examples: transfer orbit \nto geosynchronous altitude; interplanetary orbit to Mars. \n\n\u2022 Space-referenced Orbit-an operational orbit whose principal characteristic is \nbeing somewhere in space (specific orbit parameters may not be critical). \nExamples: Lagrange point orbits for space sampling and observations; orbits \nfor celestial observations or space manufacturing. \n\n\u2022 Earth-referenced Orbit-an operational orbit which provides the necessary \ncovemge of the surface of the Earth or near-Earth space. Examples: geosyn-\nchronous satellites, low-Earth satellites for Earth resources, meteorology, or \ncommunications. \n\n7.1 The Orbit Design Proeess 161 \n\nA Shuttle-launched communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit provides an \nexample of dividing a mission into segments. Once ejected from the Shuttle, the space-\ncraft may briefly stay in a parking orbit near the Shuttle to provide test and checkout \nof spacecraft and tmnsfer vehicle systems. The second mission segment uses a transfer \norbit to move the spacecmft from its parking orbit to geosynchronous equatorial orbit. \nThe spacecraft theIi enters its opemtional orbit in the geostationary ring where it will \nspend the rest of its active life. At the end of its life we must move it out of the geosta-\ntionary ring to avoid a possible collision with other satellites and to free the orbital slot \nfor a replacement. (See Sec. 21.2.) Putting the nearly dead spacecraft into a final \ndisposal orbit above the geostationary ring requires a relatively small tmnsfer orbit. \n(Going above. the geostationary ring mther than below avoids co~ons with other \nsatellites in geosynchronous transfer.) \n\nStep 2. Establish Orbit-Related Mission Requirements \n\nFor each mission segment, we define the orbit-related requirements. They may \ninclude orbital limits, individual requirements such as the altitude needed for specific \nobservations, or a range of values constmining any of the orbit parameters. Section 7.4 \ndiscusses in detail the requirements we would follow in designing an operational orbit. \nOrdinarily, these multiple requirements drive the orbit in different directions. For \nexample, resolution or required aperture tend to drive the orbit to low altitudes, but \ncovemge, lifetime, and surviVability drive the spacecraft to higher altitudes. \n\nSelecting of parking, transfer, and space-referenced orbits is normally conceptually \nsimpler, although it may be mathematically complex. Here the normal tmde is meeting \nthe desired constmints on a mission. such as lifetime, thermal, or mdiation environ-\nments, at the lowest possible propellant cost. Section 7.5 discusses the key mission \nrequirements for these orbits. \n\nStep 3. Assess Specialized Orbits \nIn selecting the orbit for any mission phase, we must first determine if a specialized \n\norbit applies. Specialized orbits are those with unique chamcteristics, such as the \ngeostationary ring in which satellites can remain nearly stationary over a given point \non the Earth's equator. We examine each specialized orbit to see if its unique charac-\nteristics are worth its cost. This examination precedes the more detailed design tmdes, \nbecause specialized orbits constmin parameters such as altitude or inclination, and \nthus often lead to very different solutions for a given mission problem. Consequently, \nwe may need to carry more than one orbit into more detailed design tmdes. \n\nStep 4. Choose Single Satellite or Constellation \n\nThe principal advantage of a single satellite is that it reduces cost by minimizing \nthe mission overhead. Thus, one satellite will have one power system, one attitude \ncontrol system, one telemetry system, and require only a single launch vehicle. A \nconstellation, on the other band, may provide better coverage, higher reliability if a \nsatellite is lost, and more survivability. We may also need a constellation to provide \nthe multiple conditions to carry out the mission, such as varying lighting conditions \nfor observations, varying geometries for navigation. or continuous covemge of part or \nall of the Earth for a communications constellation. \n\nTo meet budget limits, we must often tmde a single large satellite with larger and \nmore complex instruments against a constellation of smaller, simpler satellites. This \n\n\n\n162 Orbit and CoDStellatlon Design 7.1 \n\ndecision ~y depend on the technology available at the time of satellite design. As \nsmall satellites ~ome more capable through miniaturized electronics (Chap. 22) and \nonboard pr~g (Chap. 16), we ~y be able to construct constellations of small, \nlow-cost satellites, frequently called LightSars, that were not previously economically \nfeasible. Another major cost element for large constellations is the operational \nproblem of providing continuous navigation and control. The introduction oflow-cost \n~utonomous navigation and control (See Sec. 11.1) should promote larger constella-\ntions of small satellites in the future. \n\nStep 5. Do Mission Orbit Design Trades \n\nThe next ~. is to sel~t the mission orbit by evaluating how Orbit parameters affect \neac~ of the DI1SSJon reqwrements from Table 7-6 in Sec. 7.4. As the table shows orbit \nd~Jgn deJx:nds principally on altitnde. The easiest way to begin is by assunrlng a \ncircular ~Jt and then cond~g altitnde and inclination trades. (See Sec. 7.4 and the \n~x~pl~ m Sec. 3.3.1:) This process establishes a range of potential altitndes and \nmclinations, from which we can select one or more alternatives. Documenting the \nres~ts of ~ k~y trade ~ particularly important, so we can revisit the trade from time \nto time as DI1SSJOn reqwrements and conditions change. If a satellite constellation is \none of the alternatives, then phasing the satellites within that constellation is a key \ncharacteristic, as Sec. 7.6 describes . \n\n. Note that constellations of satellites are normally at a common altitnde and inclin-\nation .because the orbit's drift characteristics depend largely on these parameters. \nS~lli~ at \u00ab.fifferent alti.tnru:s or inclinations will drift apart so that their relative \nonentation will change WIth time. Thus, satellites at different altitndes or inclinations \nnormally do not work well together as a constellation for extended times. \n\nStep 6. Assess Launch and Retrieval or Disposal Options \n\nChapter 18 discusses satellite launch systems in detail. The launch vehicle contn\"b-\nutes strongly to mission costs, and ultimately will limit the amount of mass that can be \npla~ in an orbit of any giv~ altitnde. As we define the mission early on, we must \nproVIde enough launch margm to allow for later changes in launch vehicles or \ns~acecraft weight Natnrally, new designs require more margin than existing ones \nWIth 20% being typical for new missions. ' \n\nAlthough given little consideration in the past, retrieval and disposal of spacecraft \nhave become important to mission design (Sec. 21.2). Spacecraft that will reenter the \natmosphere must either do controlled reentry, bum up in the atmosphere or break up \ninto harmless pieces. ' \n\nIf the spacecraft will not reenter the atmosphere fu a reasonable time we must still \ndispose o~ it at ~ end of its use!'nllife so it is not hazardous to other ~ This \nproblem IS particularly acute m geosynchronous orbit where missions compete \nstrongly for orbit slots. - As Sec. 21.2 points out, a collision between two spacecraft \nnot onl~ desln?Ys ~em bu~ also ~ debris dangerous to their entire orbit regime. \n\nA third option IS satellite retrieval, done either to refurbish and reuse the satellite \nor to recover material (such as radioactive products) which would be dangerous if they \nentered the atmosphere uncontrolled. Currently, the Shuttle can retrieve spacecraft \n\n\u2022 Cefola [1987] gives. an excellent analysis of the requirements for removing satellites from \ngeosynchronous orbit. \n\n7.2 Earth Coverage 163 \n\nonly from low-Earth orbit In the futnre, it would be desirable to retrieve satellites as \nfar away as geosynchronous orbit and retnm them to either the Orbiter or Space \nStation for refurbishment, repair, disposal, or reuse. \n\nStep 7. Evaluate Constellation Growth and Replenishment \n\nAn important characteristic of any satellite constellation is growth, replenishment, \nand graceful degradation. A constellation that becomes operational only after many \nsatellites are in place causes many economic, planning, and checkout problems. \nConstellations should be at least partly serviceable with small satellite numbers. \nGraceful degradation means that if one satellite fails, the remaining satellites provide \nneeded services at a reduced level rather than a total loss of service. Section 7.6 \ndiscusses further the critical question of how we build up a constellation and how to \nplan for graceful degradation. \n\nStep 8. Create 11 V Budget \n\nTo numerically evaluate the cost of an orbit, we must create a 11 V budget for the \norbit, as described in Sec. 7.3. This then becomes the major component of the propel-\nlant budget as described in Sec. 10.3. \n\nStep 9. Document and Iterate \n\nA key component of orbit or constellation design is documenting the mission \nrequirements used to define the orbit, the reasons for selecting the orbit, and the \nnumerical values of the selected orbit parameters. This baseline can be reevaluated \nfrom time to time as mission conditions change. Because mission design nearly always \nrequires many iterations, we must make the iteration activity as $1raightforward as \npossible and readdress orbit parameters throughout the design process to ensure they \nmeet all requirements. \n\n7.2 Earth Coverage \n\nEarth coverage refers to the part of the Earth that a spacecraft instrument- or \nantenna can see at one instant or over an extended period. The coverage available for \na particular location or region is frequently a key element in mission design. In evalu-\nating coverage, two critical distinctions must be made. FIrSt, as Fig. 7-1 shows, the \ninstantaneousjield o/view, typically called the FOVor/ootprinJ, is the actnal area the \ninstrument or antenna can see at any moment In contrast, the access area is the total \narea on the ground that could potentially be seen at any moment by turning the space-\ncraft or instrument In the case of a truly omni-directional antenna, these two would \nalways be the same. For most operational instruments they are not \n\nThe second important distinction is between the area which can be seen at anyone \ninstant vs. the rate at which new land comes into view as tlJe spacecraft and instrument \nmove. Both are important, and either can be vital to mission success. In geosynchro-\nnous orbit, the instantaneous area is typically most important because the spacecraft is \n\n\u2022 Throughout this section we will use irz:rtrwnent to refer to any spacecraft sensor or antenna for \nwhich we want to compute coverage. \n\n\n\n164 Orbit and CoDSteJlation Design 7.2 \n\nAg.7-1. The Instrument Footprint or FOVIs the Instantaneous Region on the Ground Be-\nIng Covered. The instantaneous access area IS the total area In view. \n\nnearly stationary relative to the Earth's surface. In low-Earth orbit, satellites are mov-\ning rapidly over the surface, so the rate at which new land appears is usually critical. \n\nThe two distinctions above lead to four key parameters for Earth coverage: \n\n\u2022 Footprint Area (fA. ' also FOVarea or instantaneous coverage area) = area \nthat a specific instrument or antenna can see at any instant \n\n\u2022 Instantaneous Access Area (lAA) = all the area that the instrument or antenna \ncould potentially see at any instant if it were scanned through its normal range \nof orientations. \n\n\u2022 Area Coverage Rate (ACR) = the rate at which the instrument or antenna is \nsensing or accessing new land. \n\n\u2022 Area Access Rate (AAR) = the rate at which new land is coming into the space-\ncraft's access area. \n\nFor an instrument which covers all of the area available to it as the spacecraft moves \nalong, the coverage rate and access rate will be the same. For instruments operating \nonly part of the time or continuously selecting the region to be examined, the coverage \nrate and access rate may be dramatically different Generally the access area and \naccess rates depend only on the orbit and limiting geometry of the system, so we can \neasily compute them with only a minimal knowledge of the detailed system design. On \n'the other hand, the actual area coverage rate during spacecraft operations may well \ndepend on the spacecraft control, power, and management systems, as well as the \ndetails of mission operations. \n\nCoverage assessment conveniently divides into two areas: first, an analytic assess-\nment to provide approximate formulas for coverage parameters as a function of \nmission variables; second, numerical simulations to provide coverage Figures of Merit \nfor more detailed studies. \n\n7.2 Earth Coverage 165 \n\n7.2.1 Analytic Approximations \n\nIn this section we present analytic approximations for various Earth coverage \nparameters. All of the formulas here take into account ~ spherical surface of the \nEarth. but do not account for oblateness, or the rotation of the Earth underneath the \norbit These effects, in addition to those of coverage by multiple satellites. are ordi-\nnarily accounted for in numerical simulations as described in Sec. 7.2.2. \n\nAll of the formulas here are ~ved directly from the single-satellite geometry \ndescribed in Sec. 5.2. In particular, we will use the notation developed there and \nsummarized in Fig. 5-13 in Sec. 5.2. In this section we will parameterize coverage in \nterms of the Earth central angle, A... However, we can use Eqs. (5-24) to (5-28) to \ntransform each of the formulas below into one for either the spacecraft-centered nadir \nangle, 11, or spacecraft elevation angle, E, seen from the ground. \n\nAs Fig. 7-1 shows, the instrument footprint is normally a beam with circular cross \nsection substantially smaller than the access area projected onto the Earth's surface. \nThe nomenclature and computational geometry for the footprint are in Fig. 7-2. (.For \ninstruments which see very large portions of the Earth, we can use the access area \nformulas below. For those which have noncircular cross sections, the logic here along \nwith the formulas of Sec. 5.2 allows us to develop mission-specific formulas for \nfootprint size and area.) \n\nEarth Center \n\nfig. 7-2. Computational Geometry for Instrument Footprint. Note that s Is typically mea-\nsured at the toe because of performance budgeting. (See also Rg. 5-13.) \n\nThe length (also called the height) of the footprint, LF , is given by \n\nLF = KL (AFo - AFl) \n=Dsin 81sin E \n\nwhere the variables are defined in Fig. 7-2 and, for A expressed in degrees, \n\n(7-1a) \n\n(7-lb) \n\n\u2022 A. may be thought of ~ther as an angle at the Earth's center or as a distan~ measured along the \nEarth's swface. We will use these two views interchangeably as convement for the problem \nat band. \n\n\n\n166 Orbit and Constellation Design \n\nKL=1 \n\nKL = 111.319543 \n\nKL = 60.107 744 7 \n\nfor length in deg \n\nfor length in Ion \n\nfor length in nmi \n\n7.2 \n\nNote: The linear approximation given in Eq. (7-1b) is computationally convenient \nbut can be very inaccurate, particularly near the horizon where eis small. (For a satel-\nlite at an altitude of 1,000 Ion with it 1 deg diameter beam, the error in Eq. (7-1b) is \n400% at e= 1 deg, 10% at e= 15 deg, and 1% at E= 60 deg.) However, the alternative \ncomputation of Eq. (7-1a) is much less convenient To find the footprint length for a \ngiven spacecraft elevation angle at the toe of the beam, e, we begin by computing 17 \nand A at the toe, then subtract the beam width, 8, from 17 to determine 17 at the heel, \ncompute A at the heel, and finally subtract to get the footprint length from Eq. (7-1a). \nAn alternative that improves the approximation somewhat is to use the center rather \nthan the toe of the beam. Because the toe represents the worst-case link budget (see \nChap. 13), it is most often used for performance computations and, therefore, is \ncommonly used for geometry calculations as well. \n\nThe footprint width, WF, is given by \n\nWF = RE sin-l (Dsin 81RE> (7-2a) \n\n=Dsin 8 (7-2b) \nwhere ~ = 6,378.14 Ion is the radius of the Earth, 8 is the beam width, and D is the \ndistance from the spacecraft to the toe of the footprint\u00b7 Here the error in the approxi-\nmation in Eq. (7-2b) is proportional to 1-(WFlsin WF)t and is generally small relative \nto other errors. Thus, Eq. (7-2b) is adequate for most pral;tical applications. \n\nFmally, if we assume that the projection on the ground is an ellipse, then the foot-\nprint area, .& ' is given by . . \n\n.& = (1t/4)LF WF (7-3) \nAssuming that LFwas computed by Eq. (7-1a), the error in ignoring the curvature of \nthe Earth in Eq. (7-3) is again proportional to 1 - (WF I sin WF) and is negligible for most applications. . \n\nThe instantaneous area coverage rate for the beam is defined by \n\nACRinstantaneous 9.& IT (7-4) \nwhere T is the exposure time or dwell time for the instrument The average area \ncoverage rate, ACRavtr will also be a function of the duty cycle, DC, which is the \nfraction of the total time that the instrument is operating, and the average overlap \nbetween the footprint, Oavg' which is the amount by which two successiv.e footprints \ncover the same area (typiciilly about 20%): \n\nACR\"\"g \n(7-5) \n\n\u2022 In the case of a noncircuIar beam, Eq. (7-1) can be used with the beam width, 8, perpendicular \nto the horizon and Eq. (7-2) can be used independently with the beam width parallel to the \nhorizon. \n\nt Here WF should be expressed in radians as seen from the center of the Earth. \n\n7.2 Earth Coverage 167. \n\nComputing the instantaneous access area, fAA, will depend on the shape of the \npotential coverage area on the ground. Figure 7-3 shows several typical shapes. The \nmost common of these is Fig. 7-3A., which assumes that the instrument can work at \nany point on the Earth within view for which the spacecraft elevation is above E. This \ncorresponds to a small circle on the Earth of radius A centered on the current sub-\nsatellite point. Some instruments, such as radar, cannot work too close to the subsatel-\n\n. lite point. As Fig. 7-3B shows, these instruments have both an outer horizon, AI. and \nan inner horizon, ~. \n\nGround Track \n\nGround 1lack \n\nAg.7-3. Typical Access Areas for Spacecraft Instruments.

Note that here we use A. rather than.A.\"w, for the off \nground-track angle and that AV is one half of the true anomaly range (I.e., angle alo~g \nthe ground track) over which the point P is in view by the satellite. See Fig. 5-17 In \nSec. 5.3.1 for the geometry of this computation. \n\nFmally, the area access rate as the satellite sweeps over the ground for the access \narea of Fig. 7-3A is \n\nAAR = (2 KA sin )')IP (pattemA) (7-10) \nFormulas for other patterns are in Table 7-2. A~ain note that beca~ of the curva-\n\nture of the. Barth's surface, this area access rate IS not equal to the diameter of the \naccess area times the subsatellite point velocity. \n\nAs an example of the above computations, consider a spacecraft at 2,000 km \naltitude with a 1 deg diameter beam staring perpendic~ar to ~e ground track at :m \nelevation angle of 10 deg as seen from the ground. Our lInear estimate of the footpnnt \nheight is 446 km from Eq. (7 -lb). * However, from Table 7-2 we see that the true height \nis 355 km and therefore need to use the somewhat more complex Eq. (7-1a). From \n\n\u2022 As indicated previously, this estimaIe would be substantially improved if the 10 deg elevation \nangle was at the cenler of the beam. However, we would then need to keep track of beam-\ncenter parameters for the geometry and beam-edge parameters for performance estimates. \n\n\n\n170 Orbit and CoDStellation Design 7.2 \n\nEqs. (5-24), (5-26), and (5-27) we determine AFO = 31.43 deg and AF1= 28.24 deg. The \nfootprint width from Eq. (7-2a) is 77 km. From Eq. (7-3) the footprint area is 21,470 \nkm2\u2022 The accuracy of the area is proportional to 1 - (77/6;378) I sin (77/6,378) = \n0.002%. The ground track velocity is the circumferenCe of the Earth divided by the or-\nbit period (from Eq. 7-7) = 40,075 kml127 min = 315.6 kmlmin = 5.26km1s. Multi-\nplying this by the footprint height of 355 km gives a crude estimate of the area \ncoverage rate of 1,867 km2/s. Using the more accurate formula in Table 7-2 (Pattern \nD) and the values of A above, we obtain a more accurate value of ACR = 2.556 x lOS \nx (sin 31.43 deg - sin 28.24 deg) I (127 x 60) = 1,620 km2/s which implies aD error of \n15% in the less accurate approximation. . \n\nThe above formulas are in terms of off-ground-track angle, which is computation-\nally convenient. But we often need to know the coverage as a function of latitude, Lat, \nfor a satellite in a circular orbit at inclination, i. We assume that the pattern'of \nFig. 7 -3A applies and that observations can be made at any off-track angle less than or \nequal to ~ on either side of the satellite ground track. We also assume that Lat is \npositive, that is, in the northern hemisphere. (The extensions are straightforward for \nthe southern hemisphere or nonsymmetric observations.) Depending on the latitude, \nthere will be either no coverage, a single long region of coverage, or two shorter \nregions of coverage for each orbit as follows (See Fig. 7-5). \n\nOne coverage region \n\nGrotmd lIace \n\n__ -I-~~\"\" 1Wo coverage region \n\nFIg. 7-5.

Here tP is one-half the \n, longitude range over which coverage occurs. The formula in the third column above \n\nrepresents the fraction of all points at a given latitude in view of the satellite during \none orbit. This is approximately equal to the fraction of orbits that will cover a given \npoint at that latitude. \n\nAs an example of the above formula, consider a satellite in a 62.5-deg inclined orbit \nwhich can see to an off-ground-track angle, ~ = 20 deg. At a ground station latitude \nof 50 deg, the percent coverage will be 49.3%. On any orbit. 49% of the points at a \nlatitude of 50 deg will be within view of the satellite at some time. Conversely, a given \npoint at 50-~eg latitude will tx: covered at some time oJ? approximately 49~ of tI;te \nsatellite orbits. Because there IS only one coverage regIOn, the covered orbits will \noccur successively during the day. If the satellite orbit period is 2 hr, then our \nhypothetical ground station at 5O-deg latitude will typically see the satellite. on 6 \nsuccessive orbits followed by 6 orbits of no coverage. The number and duration of \ncoverage passes on a given day will depend on where the ground station is located with \nrespect to the orbit node. \n\nAs a final example, consider a satellite in a I,OOO-km circular orbit at an inclination \nof 55 deg. From Eq. (5-24), in Sec. 5.2, P = 59.82 deg and from Eq. (7-7) the orbit \nperiod is 105 min. We assume that the satellite can makeobserva~ons out to ~ space-\ncraft elevation angle of 10 deg as seen by the target, corresponding to a nadir angle \n1] = 58.36 deg from Eq. (5-26) and maximum off~track angle, ~ = 21.64 deg \n~ Eq. (5-27). From Eq. (7-10), the potential area search rate is 1.8 x 1()6 km2/min. \nFrom Eq. (7-9) a point 15 deg from the ground track will remain in view for 9.2 min. \nFmally, from Eqs. (7-11), a satellite in such an orbit will see 45.7% of all points at a \nlatitude of 50 deg and 33.4% of all points at a latitude of 20 deg. \n\n7.2.2 Numerical Simulations \n\nThe analytic formulas above provide an easy and rapid way to evaluate Earth \ncoverage, but this approach has several limitations. It does not take into account D?n-\ncircular orbits, the rotation of the Earth under the spacecraft. or possible overlappmg \ncoverage of several satellites. Although we could extend the analytic e~!ons, \nnumerically simulating the coverage is a better approach for more complex SituatiOns. \nAny modem office computer can do a simple simulation that takes these effects into \naccount with sufficient accuracy for preliminary mission analysis. \n\nAnalytic approximations also do not allow us to assess coverage statistics easily. \nFor example, while we can determine the coverage time for a given orbit pass, we \ncannot easily compute how often we will see a given point or where regions of cover-\nage or gaps between coverage will occur. We usually need these statistics for Earth \nobservation applications. \n\nNumerical simulations of coverage can become extremely complex. They may \nconsider such activities as scheduling, power and, eclipse conditions, and observability \nof the target or ground station. Chapter 3 briefly describes an example. In the follow-\ning paragraphs we will consider two simple simulations of considerable use during \npreliminary mission design. \n\nThe simplest \"simulation\" is a ground track plot of the mission geometry, clearly \nrevealing how the coverage works and the possible coverage extremes. Figure 7-6 \nshows ground trace plots for our example satellite in a 1,0000km circular orbit with a \nperiod p = 105 min, cOrresponding to approximately 14 orbits per day. The longitude \nspacing, AL, between successive node crossings on the equator is \n\n\n\n172 Orbit and ConsteDation Design \n\nP \nIlL = 1.436min \u00b7360deg \n\n(7-13) \n\nThe heavy circle on\u00b7 Fig. 7-6 represents the subsatellite points corresponding to \nspacecraft elevations, \u00a3, greater than 5 deg (equivalent to Amax < 25.6 deg). For the \n25-deg latitude shown, we can see by inspection that we will see the point P on either \ntwo or three successive upward passes and two or three successive downward passes. \nThe downward coverage passes will normally begin on the fourth orbit after the last \nupward coverage pass. Individual passes within a group will be centered approxi-\nmately 105 min apart and will be up to 105 X 51.2/360 = 14.9 min long. \n\nFig. 7-6. Ground Track of 8 Successive Orbits (out of 14 per day) for a Satellite at \n1,000 kin. The heavy circle covelS subsatellite points over which spacecraft wDl be at \nan elevation angle, to greater than 5 deg. See text for discussion. \n\nThe details of each day's potential observations will depend on how the orbit falls \nrelative to the point P. However, the general flow will be as follows. Two or three \npasses of approximately 12 min each will occur 105 min apart. (Twelve minutes is \nestimated by inspection relative to the maximum pass duration of 15 min.) After a \nbreak of 5 hr, there will be another group of 2 or 3 passes. The process will repeat after \na break of 12 hr. Though we would like to have more statistical data, the ground track \nanalysis can rapidly assess performance, represent the coverage distribution, and \ncrosscheck more detailed results. From this process we could, for example, generate \ntimelines for the most and least coverage in one day. \n\nThe next step in the numerical modeling hierarchy is a point coverage simulation. \nTo do this, we conceptually create a grid of points on the surface of the Earth, fly one \nor more spacecraft over the grid, and track the observation characteristics for each of \nthe grid points. We can then collect and evaluate data over different geographical \nregions. The most common way is to collect data along lines of constant latitude and \npresent statistical coverage results as a function of latitude. This type of simulation is \nan excellent way to evaluate coverage statistically. The main disadvantage is that it \n\n7.2 Earth Coverage 173 \n\ndoes not let us see the problem physically or admit the general analytic studies \nstemming from the formulas of Sec. 7.2.1. Thus, the best choice is to evaluate cover-\nage by combining analytic formulas, ground trace plots, and numerical simulations. \n\nAlthough the technique for the numerical point coverage simulation is straight-\nforward, the analyst must be aware of three potential pitfalls. Frrst, if we want to \ncompare coverage performance at different latitudes, then we need to have grid points \ncovering approximately equal areas over the surface of the globe. If grid points are at \nequal intervals of latitude and longitude, (at every 10 deg, for example), then the \nnumber of points per unit area will be much greater near the poles, thus incorrectly \nweighting polar data in the overall global statistics. We can easily resolve this artificial \nweighting by using grid points at a constant latitude spacing with the number of points \nat each latitude proportional to the cosine of that latitude. This covers the globe with \nan approximately equal number of points per unit area and properly balances the \nglobal statistics. \n\nOur second problem is to adjust for gaps where the simulation begins and ends. \nOtherwise, these gaps will make gap statistics unrealistic because true gaps and \ncoverage regions will not begin and end at the start and end points of the simulation. \nThe easiest solution is to run the simulation long enough that start and end data have \nminimal impact on the statistics. \n\nThe third, and perhaps most significant, problem is that we are trying to collect \nstatistical data on a process for which statistical distributions do not apply. Most \nstatistical measures, such as the mean, standard deviation, or the 90th percentile \nassume that the data being sampled has a Gaussian or random distribution. While the \ndistribution which we found by examining the ground track plot above was not \nuniform. it was also not at all important for some activities. Our estimation of above 2 \nto 3 passes of 12 min each, twice per day, gives an average percent coverage on the \norder of 1 hr/24 hr = 4%. But just collecting statistical data and concluding that the \npercent coverage is about 4% is remarkably unifonnative. That could be the result of \n1 hr of continuous coverage and 23 hr of no coverage or 2.5 min of coverage every \nhour. Similar problems plague all of the nonnal statistical measures applied to orbit \nanalysis. The important point is: \n\nStatistical analysis of inherently nonstatistical data, such as orbit \ncoverage, can lead to dramatically incorrect conclusions. \n\nSimple techniques such as ground track analysis are imperative to understand and \nvalidate the conclusions we reach. \n\n7.2.3 Coverage Figures of Merit \nHaving established a simulation technique, we need to find a way to accumulate \n\ncoverage statistics and to evaluate the quality of coverage. As described in Chap. 3, we \ncan quantify coverage quality by providing a coverage Figure of Merit (an appro-\npriate numerical mechanism for comparing the coverage of satellites and constella-\ntions). We wish to fmd a Figure of Merit which is physically meaningful, easy to \ncompute in our numerical simulation, and fair in comparing alternative constellations. \nThe most common general purpose coverage Figures of Merit are: \n\n\u2022 Percent Coverage \n\nThe percent cOverage for any point on the grid is simply the number of times \nthat point was covered by one or more satellites divided by the total number \n\n\n\n174 Orbit ~d CoDStellation Design 7.2 \n\nof simulation time steps. It is numerically equal to the analytically computed \npercent coverage in Eq. (7-11). The advantage of percent coverage is that it \nshows directly how much of the time a given point or region on the ground is \ncovered. However, it does not provide any information about the distribution \nof gaps in that coverage. \n\n\u2022 Maximum Coverage Gap (= Maximum Response Time) \n\nThe 17lOXimum coverage gap is simply the longest of the covemge gaps \nencountered for an individual point When looking at statistics over more than \none point, we can either average the maximum gaps or take their maximum \nvalue. ThuS the worldwide mean maximum gap would be the average value of \nthe maximum gap for all the individual points, and the worldwide maximum \ngap would be the largest of any of the individual gaps. This statistic conveys \nsome worst-case information, but it incorrectly ranks constellations because a \nsingle point or a small number of points determine the results. Thus. the \nmaximum coverage gap, or maximum response time, is a poor Figure of Merit \n\n\u2022 Mean Coverage Gap \n\nThe mean coverage gap is the average length of breaks in covemge for a given \npoint on the simulation grid. To compute gap statistics, we must have three \ncounters for each point on the simulation grid. One counter tmcks the number \nof gaps. A second tmcks total gap duration. The third tmcks the duration of the \ncurrent gap and is reset as needed. During the simulation, if no satellite covers \na given point on the grid, we increment the gap length counter (3) by one time \nstep. If the point is covered but was not covered the previous time (indicated \nby a value of the gap length counter greater than 0), then we have reached the \nend of an individual gap. We increment the counter for the number of gaps (1) \nby one and add the gap duration to the total gap counter (2) or incorporate it \nin other statistics we want to collect The final mean covemge gap is computed \nby dividing the total gap length by the number of gaps. As noted above, what \nhappens at the beginning and end of the simulation influences all statistics \nrelating to gap distribution. \n\n\u2022 Time Average Gap \n\nThe time average gap is the mean gap duration averaged over time. Alterna-\ntively, it is the average length of the gap we would find if we mndomly \nsampled the system. To compute the time average gap, two counters are \nrequired--one for the current gap length and one for the sum of the squares of \ngap lengths. During the simulation, if no satellite covers a given point on the \ngrid, add one to the current gap length counter. If the point is covered, square \nthe current gap length, add the results to the sum of the squares counter, and \nreset the current gap length counter to zero. (If the current gap length counter \nwas previously 0, then no change will have occurred in either counter.) The \ntime avemge gap is computed at the end of the simulation by dividing the sum \nof the squares of the gaps by the duration of the simulation. \n\n\u2022 Mean Response Time \n\nThe mean response time is the average time from when we receive a mndom \nrequest to observe a point until we can observe it If a satellite is within view \n\n73 Earth Coverage 175 \n\nof the point at a given time step, the response time at that step will be O. *If the \npoint in question is in a coverage gap, then the response time would be the \ntime until the end of the coverage gap. In principle, response time should be \ncomputed from a given time step to the end of a gap. But by symmetry we \ncould also count the time from the beginning of the gap--a computationally \nconvenient method with the same results. Thus the response time counter will \nbe set to 0 if a point is covered at the current time step. We advanCe the \nresponse time counter by one time step if the point is not now covered. The \nmean response time will then be the average value of all response times for all \ntime steps. This Figure of Merit takes into account both coverage and gap \nstatistics in trying to determine the whole system's responsiveness. As shown \nbelow, the mean response time is the best coverage Figure of Merit for \nevaluating overall responsiveness. \n\nTo illustmte the meaning and relative advantages of these Figures of Merit, Fig. 7-7 \ndiagrams a simplified coverage simulation from three satellite systems: A, B, and C. \nThese could, for example, be three sample FrreSat constellations. Our goal is to see \nevents as quickly as possible, and therefore, minimize gaps. Constellation B is \nidentical to A except for one added gap, which makes B clearly a worse solution than \nA. C has the same overall percent coverage as A, but the gaps are redistributed to \ncreate a mther long gap, making C the worst constellation for regular covemge. \n\nA Best \n\nB Second \n\nc Worst \nTime \n\nPercent Maximum Mean Time Mean \nCoverage Gap Gap Average Gap Response TIme \n\nA 60 2 1.33 0.6 0.5 \nB 50 2 1.25 0.7 0.6 \n\nC 60 3 2.00 1.0 0.7 \n\nFIg. 7-7. Coverage Rgures of Merit. See text for explanation. \n\n\u2022 One advantage of response time as a Figure of Merit is that delays in processing or communi-\ncations (for both data requests and responses) can be directly added to the coverage response \ntime. This results in a total response time, which measures the total time from when users \nrequest data until they receive it We can also evaluate minimum, mean, and maximum total \nresponse times which have much more operational meaning than simple gap statistics but 8fe \nstiII easy to compute. \n\n\n\n176 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.3 \n\nThe table below Fig. 7-7 shows the numerical v~ues of the Figures ofM;mt defined \nabove. The percent coverage correctly ranks constellation A better than B, but because \nit does not take gap statistics into account it cannot distinguish between A and C. \nSimilarly, the maximum gap cannot distinguish between A and B, even though B is \nclearly worse by having an additional gap. In this.case the maximum gap tells us which \nconstellation is worst but cannot distinguish between two constellations which are \nclearly different \n\nThe ~an gap statistic is even more misleading. By adding a short gap to constel-\nlation B, the ~verage length of the gaps has been decreased, and consequently, this. \nFigure of Ment ranks constellation B above constellation A. (This can happen in rea] \nconstellation statistics. By adding satellites we may eliminate some of the very small \ngaps, thus increasing the average gap length, even though more satellites provide \nmore and better coverage.) \n\nFmally, the time average gap and ~an response time in the fourth and fifth \ncolumns correctly rank the three constellations in order of preference by taking into \naccount both the percent coverage and gap statistics. Consequently, both of these are \nbetter Figures of Merit than the other three. I believe the mean response time is the \nstronger Figure of Merit because it provides a more useful measure of the end per-\nformance of the system and because it can be easily extended to include delays due to \nprocessing, communications, decision making, or the initiation of action. However, \nbecause each of the Figures of Merit represent different characteristics we should \nevaluate more than one. Specifically, I recommend evaluating mean response time, \npercent coverage, and maximum gap, and qualitatively (not quantitatively) weighting \nthe results in that order, keeping strongly in mind the caveat at the end of Sec. 7.2.2. \n\n7.3 The AV Budget, \n\nT~ an orbit designer, a ~pace mission is a series of different orbits. For example, a \nsatellIte may be released m a low-Earth parking orbit, transferred to some mission \norbit, go through a series of rephasings or alternative mission orbits, and then move to \nsome final orbit at the end of its useful life. Each of these orbit changes requires \nenergy. The 6. V budget is traditionally used to account for this energy. It is the sum of \nthe velocity changes required throughout the space mission life. In a broad sense the \n6. V budget represents the cost for each mission orbit scenario. In designing orbits and \nconstellations, we must balance this cost against the utility achieved. \n\nChapter 10 shows how to develop Ii propulsion budget based on a given 6. V budget \nFor preliminary design, we can estimate the \"cost\" of the space mission by using the \nrocket equation to determine the total required spacecraft plus propellant mass, '!'i.e \nTTl() + mp' in terms of the dry mass of the spacecraft, mo, the total required 6. V, and the \npropellant exhaust velocity, Yo: \n\n(7-14) \n\nThis is equi~al~t to Eqs. (17-6) and (17:7) in Sec. 17.~, with Vo replaced by Ispg, \nwhere the specific unpulse, Isp:; Vo Ig, and g IS the acceleration of gravity at the Earth's \nsurface. Typical exhaust velocities are in the range of 2 to 4 kmls and up to 30 kmls \nfor electric propulsion. We can see from Eq. (7-14) that 6. V requirements much smaller \nthan the exhaust velocity (a few hundred meters per second), will require a piopellant \n\n7.3 The AV Budget 177 \n\nmass which is a small fraction of the total mass. If the total 6. V required is equal to the \nexhaust velocity, then we will need a total propellant mass equal to e -I\"\" 1.7 times \nthe mass of the spacecraft. Propulsion systems require additional structure such as \ntanks, so a 6. V much greater than the exhaust velocity is difficn1t to achieve. It may \nscuttle the mission or require some alternative, such as staging or refueling. \n\n~able 7-3 s~ how to construct a 6. V budget We begin by writing down the \nbastc data requrred to compute 6. Vs: the launch vehicle's initial conditions, the mission \norbit or orbits, the mission duiation, required orbit maneuvers or maintenance and the \nmechanism for spacecraft disposal. We then transform each item into an equiv~ent 6. V \nrequirement using the formulas listed in the table. The right-hand column shows how \nthese formulas apply to the FrreSat mission. Figure 7-8 shows the 6. V required for \naltitude maintenance for typical spacecraft and atmosphere parameters. \n\n10~L---~ ____ L-__ -L ____ L-__ -L ____ L-~-=~ __ ~L-__ ~ \n\n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 90o. 1.000 \n\nAltitude (Ion) \n\nAg.7-8.

This phenom-\nenon is like the elastic collision between a baseball and a bat, in which the velocity of \nthe ball relative to the bat is nearly the same, but its velocity relative to the surrounding \nbaseball park can change dramatically. We can use flybys to change direction, to \nprovide increased heliocentric energy for solar system exploration, or to reduce the \namount of energy the satellite has in inertial space. For example. one of the most \nenergy-efficient ways to send a space probe near the Sun is to use a flyby of Jupiter to \nreduce the intrinsic heliocentric orbital velocity of Earth associated with any space-\ncraft launched from Earth. \n\n7.4 Selecting Orbits for Earth-Referenced Spacecraft 179 \n\nA second way to produce a large IJ. V without burning propellant is to use the \natmosphere of the Earth or other planets to change the spacecraft's direction or reduce \nits energy relative to the planet. The manned flight program has used this method from \nthe beginning to dissipate spacecraft energy for return to the Earth's surface. Mars \nPathfinder used aerobraking for planetary exploration. It can also be used to produce \na major plane change through an aeroassist trajectory [Austin, Cruz, and French, \n1982; Mease, 1988). \n\nThe solar sail is a third way to avoid using propellant. The large, lightweight sail \nuses solar radiation to slowly push a satellite the way the wind pushes a sailboat Of \ncourse, the low-pressure sunlight produces very low acceleration. \n\nThe aerospace literature discusses many alternatives for providing spaceflight \nenergy. But experimental techniques (those other than rocket propulsion and atmo-\nspheric braking) are risky and costly, so normal rocket propulsion will ordinarily be \nused to develop the needed IJ. V, if this is at all feasible. \n\nThe IJ.V budget described in Table 7-3 measures the energy we must give to the \nspacecraft's center of mass to meet mission conditions. When we transform this IJ.V \nbudget into a propellant budget (Chap. 10), we must consider other characteristics. \nThese include, for example, inefficiencies from thrusters misaligned with the IJ. V \ndirection, and any propulsion diverted from IJ. V to provide attitude control during orbit \nmaneuvers. Chapters 10 and 17 describe propulsion requirements in detail. \n\nFor most circumstances, the IJ. V budget does not include margin because it results \nfrom astrodynamic equations with little error. Instead, we maintain the margin in the \npropellant budget itself, where we can reflect such specific elements as residual \npropellant. An exception is the use of IJ. V to overcome atmospheric drag. Here the IJ. V \ndepends upon the density of the atmosphere, which is both variable and difficult to \npredict Consequently, we must either conservatively estimate the atmospheric density \nor incorporate IJ. V margin for low-Earth satellites to c.ompensate for atmospheric \nvariations. \n\n7.4 Selecting Orbits for Earth-Referenced Spacecraft \n\nThe fIrst step in finding the appropriate orbit for an Earth-referenced mission is to \ndetermine if a specialized orbit from Table 7-4 applies.\u00b7 We should examine each of \nthese orbits individually to see if its characteristics will meet the mission requirements \nat reasonable cost. Space missions need not be in specialized orbits, but these orbits \nhave come into common use because of their valuable characteristics. Because they do \nconstrain such orbit parameters as altitude and inclination. we must determine whether \nor not to use them before doing the more detailed design trades described below. \n\nIt is frequently the existence of specialized orbits which yields very different solu-\ntions for a given space mission problem. Thus, a geosynchronous orbit may provide \nthe best coverage characteristics, but may demand too much propellant, instrument \nresolution, or power. This trade of value versus cost can lead to dramatically different \nsolutions, depending on mission needs. For a traditional communications system, the \nvalue of providing continuous communicati~ns coverage outweighs the cost and \nperformance loss associated with the distance to geostationary orbit Some communi-\ncations systems provide continuous coverage with\u00b7a low-Earth orbit constellation as \ndescribed in Sec. 7.6. In the case of FireSat, continuous coverage is not required and \n\n\u2022 For an extended discussion see Cooley [19721 or Wertz [2001]. \n\n\n\n189 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.4 \n\nTABLE 7-4.

There \nis no a priori way of knowing how these trades will conclude, so we may need to carry \nmore than one orbit into detailed design trades. In any case, we should reconsider \nspecialized orbits from time to time to see whether or not their benefits are indeed \nworth their added constraints. \n\nOrbit design is inherently iterative. We must evaluate the effects of orbit trades on \nthe mission as a whole. In selecting the orbit, we need to evaluate a single satellite vs. \na constellation, specialized orbits, and the choice of altitude and inclination. For \nexample, alternative solutions to a communications problem include a single large \nsatellite in geosynchronous equatorial orbit and a constellation of small satellites in \nlow-Earth orbit at high inclination. \n\nThe first step in designing mission orbits is to determine the effect of orbit param-\neters on key mission requirements. Table 7-5 summarizes the mission requirements \nthat ordinarily affect the orbit. The table shows that altitude is the most important of \norbit design parameter. \n\nThe easiest way to begin the orbit trade process is by assuming a circular orbit and \nthen conducting altitude and inclination trades as described below and summarized in \nthe table. This process establishes a range of altitudes and inclinations, from which we \ncan select one or more alternatives. Documenting the reasons for these results is \nparticularly important, so we can revisit the trade from time to time as mission require-\nments and conditions change. \n\nSelecting the mission orbit is often highly complex, involving such choices as \naVailability of launch vehicle, coverage, payload performance, communication links. \nand any political or technical constraints or restrictions. Thus, considerable effort may \ngo into the process outlined in Table 7-1. Figure 3-1 in Sec. 3.23 shows the results of \nthe altitude trade for the FrreSat mission. Typically these trades do not result in \nspecific values for altitude or inclination, but a range of acceptable values and an \nindication of those we would prefer. Ordinarily, low altitudes achieve better instru-\n\nT \n7.4 Selecting Orbits for Earth-Referenced Spacecraft 181 \n\nTABLE 7-5.

They also require \nless energy to reach orbit. On the other hand, higher orbits have longer lifetimes and \nprovide better Earth coverage. Higher orbits are also more survivable for satellites \nwith military applications. Orbit selection factors usually compete with each other \nwith some factors favoring higher orbits and some lower. \n\nOften, a key factor in altitude selection is the satellite's radiation environment As \ndescribed in Sec. 8.1, the radiation environment undergoes a substantial change at \napproximately 1,000 kID. Below this altitude the atmosphere will quickly clear out \ncharged particles, so the radiation density is low. Above this altitude are the VanAllen \nbelts, whose high level of trapped radiation can greatly reduce the lifetime of \nspacecraft components. Most mission orbits therefore separate naturally into either \nlow-Earth orbits (LEO), below 1,000 to 5,000 kID, and geosynchronous orbits (GEO), \n\n\n\n182 Orbit and CoDSteDation Design 7.4 \n\nwhich are well above the Van AIlen belts. Mid-range altitudes may have coverage \ncharacteristics which make them particularly valuable for some missions. However, \nthe additional shielding or reduced life stemming from this region's increased \nmdiation environment also makes them more costly. \n\nHaving worked the problem assuming a circular orbit, we should also assess the \npotential advantages of using eccentric orbits. These orbits have a greater peak altitude \nfor a given amount of energy, lower perigee than is possible with a circular orbit, and \nlower velocity at apogee, which makes more time available there. Unfortunately, \neccentric orbits also give us non-uniform coverage and variable range and speed. \n\nEccentric orbits have an additional difficulty because the oblateness of the Earth \ncauses perturbations which make perigee rotate mpidly. This rotation leads to mpid \nchanges in the apogee's position relative to the Earth's surface. Thus, with most orbits, \nwe cannot maintain apogee for long over a given latitude. As Sec. 6.2 describes, the \nfirst-order rotation of perigee is proportional to (2 - 2.5 sin2i) which equals zero at an \ninclination, i = 63.4 deg. At this critical inclination the perigee will not rotate, so we \ncan maintain both apogee and perigee over fixed latitudes. Because this orientation can \nprovide coverage at high northern latitudes, the Soviet Union has used such a Molniya \norbit for communications satellites for many years. Geosynchronous orbits do not \nprovide good coverage in high latitude regions. \n\nEccentric orbits help us sample either a range of altitudes or higher or lower \naltitudes than would otherwise be possible. That is why scientific monitoring missions \noften use high eccentricity orbits. As discussed in Sec. 7.6, Draim [1985, 1987a, \n1987b] has done an extensive evaluation of the use of elliptical orbits and concluded \nthat they can have significant advantages in optimizing covemge and reducing the \nnumber of satellites required. \n\nFireSat Mission Orbit. Our first step for the FrreSat mission orbit is to look at the \nappropriateness of the specialized orbits from Table 7-4. This is done for FrreSat in \nTable 7-6. As is frequently the case, the results provide two distinct regimes. One pos-\nsibility is a single geosynchronous FrreSat In this case, covemge of North America \nwill be continuous but covemge will not be available for most of the rest of the world. \nResolution will probably be the driving requirement \n\nTABLE 7-&. FlreSat Specialized Orbit Trade. The conclusion Is that In low-Earth orbit we do \nnot need a specialized orbit for FlreSal Thti frozen orbit can be used with any of the \nlow-Earth orbit solutions. \n\nGood for \nOrbit Advantages Disadvantages FlreSat \n\nGeosynchronous Continuous view of High energy requirement Yes \ncontinental U.S. No world-wide coverage \n\nCoverage of Alaska not good \n\nSun-synchronous None High energy requirement No \n\nMoIniya Good Alaska coverage High energy requirement No, unless \nAcceptable view of Strongly varying range Alaska Is \ncontinental U.S. critical \n\nFrozen Orbit Minimizes propellant usage None Yes \n\nRepeating Ground Repeating viewing angle Restricts choice of altitude Probably not \nTrack (marginal advantage) Some perturbations stronger \n\n7.5 Selecting Transfer, Parking, and Space-Referenced Orbits 183 \n\nThe alternative is a low-Earth orbit constellation. ResolUtion is less of a problem \nthan for geosynchronous. Coverage will not be continuous and will depend on the \nnumber of satellites. None of the specialized low-Earth orbits is needed for FrreSat (A \nfrozen orbit can be used with essentially any low-Earth orbit) Thus, for the low-Earth \nconstellation option, there will be a broad tmde between\u00b7 coverage, launchability, \naltitude maintenance, and the mdiation environment . \n\nFor low-Earth orbit, coverage will be the principal driving requirement. Figure 3-1 \nin Sec. 3.2.3 summarized the FrreSat altitude tmdes and resulted in selecting an alti-\ntude range of 600 to 800 km with a preliminary value of 700 Ian. This may be affected \nby further coverage, weight, and launch selection tmdes. FrreSat will need to cover \nhigh northern latitudes, but covemge of the polar regions is not needed. Therefore, we \nselect a preliminary inclination of 55 deg which will provide coverage to about 65 deg \nlatitude. This will be refined by later performance tmdes, but is not likely to change by \nmuch. -\n\nZero eccentricity should be selected unless there is a compelling reason to do \notherwise. There is not in this case, so the FrreSat orbit should be circular. Thus, the \npreliminary FrreSat low-Earth orbit constellation has a = 700 kID, i = 55 deg, e = 0, \nand the number of satellites selected to meet minimum coverage requirements. \n\n7.5 Selecting Transfer, Parking, and Space-Referenced Orbits \n\nSelecting transfer, parking, and space-referenced orbits proceeds much the same as \nfor Earth-referenced orbits, although their chamcteristics will be different Table 7-7 \nsummarizes the main requirements. We still look first at specialized orbits and then at \ngeneral orbit characteristics. Table 7-8 shows the most common specialized orbits. \nThe orbits described in this section may be either the end goal of the whole mission or \nsimply one portion, but the criteria for selection will be the same in either case. \n\nTABLE 7-7.

For transfer orbits \nearly in the mission, the launch vehicle or a sepamte upper stage was tmditionally \ntasked with doing the work as described in Chap. 18. Because of the continuing drive \nto reduce cost, integml propulsion upper stages have become substantially more \ncommon (see Chap. 17). \n\n\n\n184 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.5 \n\nTABLE 7-11.

As \ndiscussed in Sec. 6.1, the total energy of a Keplerian orbit depends only on the semi-\nmajor axis. Consequently, only transfer orbits which change the mean altitude, such as \ntransfer from LEO to OEO, require adding energy to the satellite. Clearly, if we wish \nto go to an orbit with a higher energy level then we must find some process to provide \nthe additional energy, such as rocket propulsion or a lunar or planetary flyby. If we \nmust remove energy from the orbit, we can frequently use atmospheric drag. \n\nA change in satellite direction without changing energy normally involves a plane \nchange (inclination or node), although we may also change the eccentricity without \nchanging the mean altitude. (Any small thrust perpendicular to the velocity cannot \nchange the orbit energy, or therefore, the mean altitude.) To change the satellite orbit \nplane or eccentricity without changing the total energy, several options are available. \n\nIf we choose to change directions\u00b7 by using propulsion, then propellant require-\nments will typically be large; the !J. V required to change directions is directly \nproportional to the spacecraft velocity, which is about 7 kmls in low-Earth orbit. \nFortunately, other techniques for changing the orbit plane require less energy. For \nexample, suppose we want to shift the node of an orbit to create a constellation with \nnodes equally spaced around the Earth's equator or to replace a dead satellite. If the \nconstellation is at an altitude other than that of the replacement satellite, we can use \nthe node regression provided by normal orbit perturbations. The rate at which the node \nof an orbit precesses varies substantially with altitude, as described in Sec. 6.2. \nSpecifically, if we have a final constellation at a high altitude, we cat! inject and leave \nthe replacement satellite at low altitude so that the node rotates differentially with \nrespect to the high-altitude constellation. When the satellite reaches the desired node, \nan orbit transfer is made with no plane change, thus using much less energy. In this \ncase we are trading orbit transfer time for energy. \n\nA second way to reduce the !J. V for large plane changes is to couple them with \naltitude changes. The net required !J. V will be the vector sum of the two perpendicular \ncomponents changing the altitude and directioD-Substantially less than if the two \nburns were done separately. ! \n\n7.5 Selecting Transfer, Parking, and Space-Referenced Orbits 185 \n\nBecause the !J. V required to change the plane is directly proportional to satellite \nvelocity, plane changes are easier at high altitudes where the satellite velocity is lower. \nThat is why most of the plane change in geosynchronous transfer orbit is done at \napogee rather than perigee. . \n\nIf the required plane change is large, it may cost less total propellant to use a three-\nburn transfer rather than a two-burn transfer [Betts, 1977]. In this case, the first perigee \nburn puts apogee at an altitude above the ultimate altitude goal, because the apogee \nvelocity is lower there; During a second burn, the plane change is made using a smaller \n.1 V and perigee is raised to the final altitude. The third bum then brings apogee back \nto the desired end altitude. This process is not more efficient for small plane changes \nsuch as those associated with launch from mid-latitudes to geosynchronous equatorial \norbit. A third proposed way to make large plane changes is the aeroassist orbit \ndescribed in Sec. 7.3 [Austin, Cruz, and French, 1982; Mease, 1988]. \n\nOrdinarily, we want to transfer a satellite using the smallest amount of energy, \nwhich commonly leads to using a Hohmann transfer as described in Sec. 6.3. How-\never, as illustrated in Fig. 7-9 and described in Table 7-9, other objectives may \ninflqence the selection of a transfer orbit. For example, we can reduce the transfer time \nrelative to a Hohmann orbit by using additional energy. These transfers are not \ncommon, but they may be appropriate if transfer time is critical as might be true for \nmilitary missions or a manned mission to Mars. \n\nA. High Energy B.

With a low-thrust chemical \ntransfer, we can deploy and check out a satellite in low-Earth orbit where we can still \nrecover it before transferring it to a high-energy orbit where we cannot. Low-thrust \ntransfer provides substantially lower acceleration and, therefore, a more benign \nenvironment. Also, we are more likely to be able to recover a satellite if the propulsion \nsystem fails. The principal disadvantage of low-thrust chemical transfer is that it is a \nvery nontraditional approach. Wertz, Mullikin, and Brodsky [1988] and Wertz [2001] \ndescribe low-thrust chemical transfer further. \n\nAnother type of low-thrust transfer uses electric propulsion, with extremely low \nacceleration levels-at levels of 0.001 g or less [Cornelisse, SchGyer, and Wakker, \n1979}. Transfer therefore will take several months, even when the motors are thrusting \ncontinuously. Consequently, as Fig. 7-9D shows, electric propulsion transfer requires \n\n7.5 Selecting Transfer, Parking, and Space-Referenced Orbits 187 \n\nspiralling out, with increased total AV (see Table 7-9).

Gravity-assist missions can use the Earth, but \nthe satellite must first recede to a relatively high altitude and then come back near the \nEarth. * For a more extended discussion of gravity-assist missions, see Kaufman, \nNewman, and Chromey [1966], or Wertz [2001].

[1997, 1998) and \nFarquhar and Dunham [1998] have separately propo~ interesting techniqu~ for \nusing a different orbit injection process to substantially mcrease the mass avallable \n(and, therefore, reduce the launch cost) for high-energy interplanetary transfers. \n\nFireSat Transfer Orbit. We assume that FireSat will be launched into a l50-km, \ncircular parking orbit at the proper inclination and need to determine .how to get to the \noperational orbit of 700 km. For now, we assume some type of orbIt ~fer. When \nthe spacecraft weight becomes better known and. a .range of launch. vehicles selected, \nanother trade will be done to determine whether It IS more econorrucal for the launch \nvehicle to put FireSat directly into its operational orbit. \n\nThe FireSat orbit transfer A V from Table 7-3 is a modest 309 mls. It is not worth \nthe added cost, solar array weight, or complexity for electric propulsion transfer. There \nis no reason for a high-energy transfer. We are left to select betw~n a Ho~ \ntransfer and a low-thrust chemical transfer. The Hohmann transfer IS the traditioDal \napproach. ... \n\nLow-thrust chemical transfer proVIdes a more berugn transfer envrronment and the \npotential for low-orbit deployment and checko~t so that ~tellite recov~ would be a \npossibility. The propulsion system would be hghter. we~ght and ~?ITe les~ control \nauthority. We may be able to do the orbit transfer usmgJust the miSSIon orbIt control \nmodes and hardware which could completely eliminate a whole set of components and \ncontrol logic. . \n\nFor FireSat we will make a preliminary selection of low-thrust chemIcal transfer. \nThis is non-traditional, but probably substantially lower cost and lower risk. Later in \nthe mission design, the launch vehicle may eliminate this transfer orbit entirely. \n\n7.5:2 Parking and Space-Referenced Orbits \n\nIn parking or space-referenced orbits, the position of the spacecraft relative to the \nEarth is unimportant except for blockage of com~uni~ations or fields of v~ew. Here \nthe goal is simply to be in space to observe celestial objects, sample the enVlfOnment, \nor use the vacuum or low-gravity of space. These orbits are used, for example, for \nspace manufacturing facilities, celestial observatories such as Space Telescope and \nChandra X-Ray Observatory, or for testing various space applications and processes. \nBecause we are not concerned with our orientation relative to the Earth, we select such \norbits to use minimum energy while maintaining the orbit altitude, and possibly, to \ngain an unobstructed view of space. For example, Sun-synchronous orbits may be \n\n\u00b7Using the Earth for a gravity assist was first proposed by Meissinger (1970). \n\n\n\n188 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.6 \n\nappropriate for maintaining a constant Sun angle with respect to a satellite instrument \nAnother example is the parking or storage orbit a low-Earth orbit high enough to re-\nduce atmospheric drag, but low enough to be easy to reach. We may store satellites \n(referred to as on-orbit spares) in these orbits for later transfer to other altitudes. \n\nAn interesting class of orbits which have been used for environmental monitoring \nand proposed for space manufacturing are libration point orbits or \u00b7lAgrange orbits, \nnamed after the 18th century mathematician and astronomer, Joseph Lagrange. The \nlAgrange points for two celestial bodies in mutual revolution, such as the Earth and \nMoon or Earth and Sun, are five points such that an object placed at one of them will \nremain there indefinitely. We can place satellites in \"orbit\" around the Lagrange points \nwith relatively small amounts of energy required to maintain these orbits. (For more \ndetails, see Wertz [2001].) \n\n7.6 Constellation Design \n\nIn designing a constellation, we apply all of the criteria for designing a single-\nsatellite orbit. Thus, we need to consider whether each satellite is launchable, \nsurvivable, and properly in view of ground stations or relay satellites. We also need to \nconsider the number of satellites, their relative positions, and how these positions \nchange with time. both in the course of an orbit and over the lifetime of the \nconstellation. \n\nSpecifying a constellation by defining all of the orbit elements for each satellite is \ncomplex, inconvenient, and overwhelming in its range of options. A reasonable way \nto begin is by looking at constellations with all satellites in circular orbits at a common \naltitude and inclination, as discussed in Sec. 7.4. This means that the period, angular \nvelocity, and node rotation rate will be the same for all of the satellites. This leads to \na series of trades on altitude, inclination, and constellation pattern involving prin-\ncipally the number of satellites, coverage, launch cost, and the environment (primarily \ndrag and radiation). We then examine the potential of elliptical orbits and the addition \nof an equatorial ring. The principal parameters that will need to be defined are listed \nin Table7-10. After exploring the consequences of some of the choices, we will \nsummarize the orbit design process in Sec. 7.6.2. A more detailed discussion is given \nin Wertz [2ool}. \n\nNo absolute rules exist. A constellation of satellites in randomly spaced low-Earth \norbits is a serious possibility for a survivable communications system. The Soviet \nUnion has used a constellation of satellites in highly eccentric Molniya orbits for \ndecades. Various other missions may find satellite clusters useful. One of the most \ninteresting characteristics of the low-Earth orbit communications constellations is that \nthe constellation builders have invested billions of dollars and arrived at distinctly \ndifferent solutions. For example, a higher altitude means fewer satellites, but a much \nmore severe radiation environment (as discussed in Sec. 8.1), such that the cost of each \nsatellite will be higher and the life potentially shorter. Similarly, elliptical orbits allow \nan additional degree of freedom which allows the constellation to be optimized for \nmultiple factors, but requires a more complex satellite operating over a range of \naltitudes and velocities and passing through heavy radiation regimes. (See, for \nexample, Draim [1985].) Because the constellation's size and structure strongly affect \na system's cost and performance, we must carefully assess alternate designs and doc-\nument the reasons for final choices. It is this list of reasons that allows the constellation \ndesign process to continue. \n\n7.6 Constellation Design 189 \n\nTABLE 7-10. PrIncipal Factors to be DefIned During ConsteliaHon Design.

Given this objective, the normal trade in constellation design \nis coverage as a measure of performance versus the number of satellites as a measure \nof cost Thus, we normally assume that a five-satellite constellation will be less \n\n\u2022 The principal alternative is the scientific satellite constellation which may, for example, want \nto sample simultaneoUsly the magnetosphere and solar particle flux at various locations and \naltitudes. \n\n\n\n190 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.6 \n\nexpensive than a six-satellite one, but this assumption may be wrong. The larger con-\nstellation may be at a lower altitude or inclination and, therefore, cost less to launch or \nhave a less harsh radiation environment. Alternatively, we may be able to have a \nsmaller constellation with elliptical orbits, for which increased spacecraft complexity \ncould offset the lower cost due to the number of satellites. \n\nA Principal characteristic of any satellite constellation is the number of orbit planes \nin which the satellites reside. Symmetry in constellation structure requires an equal \nnumber of satellites in each orbit plane. This means that an eight-satellite constellation \nmay have either one, two, four, or eight separate orbit planes. But because JI!Oving \nsatellites between planes uses much more propellant than moving them within a plane, \nit is highly advantageous to place more satellites in a smaller number of planes. \nMoving satellites within an orbit plane requires only a slight change in the satellite \naltitude. This changes the period so we can slowly rephase the satellite within the con-\nstellation, and then return it to the proper altitude to maintain its position relative to the \nrest. Thus, we can rephase many times using relatively little propellant. If a satellite \nfails or a new satellite is added to a given orbit plane, we can rephase the remaining \nsatellites so that they are uniformly spaced. The consequence of this is to provide a \nsignificant premium to constellations which contain more satellites in a smaller \nnumber of orbit planes. \n\nThe number of orbit planes relates strongly to a coverage issue often overlooked in \nconstellation design: the need to provide the constellation both performance plateaus \nand graceful degradation. Ideally one would like to achieve some performance level \nwith the very first satellite launched and to raise that level of performance with each \nsucceeding satellite. Generally, however, performance tends to come in plateaus as we \nput one more satellite into each orbit plane of the final constellation. If a constellation \nhas seven orbit planes, we will achieve some performance with the first satellite. but \nthe next major performance plateau may not come until one satellite is in each of the \nseven planes. We would expect this constellation to have plateaus at one, seven, four-\nteen, twenty-one, (and so on) satellites. Again, constellations with a small number of \norbit planes have a distinct advantage over many-plane ones. A single-plane constel-\nlation produces performance plateaus with each added satellite, whereas one with two \nplanes would have plateaus at one, two, four, six, eight, (and so on) satellites. Thus, \nmore complex constellations will require more satellites for each performance plateau. \n\nFrequent performance plateaus have several advantages. FU'Sl, because individual \nsatellites are extremely expensive, we may want to build and launch one or two \nsatellites to verify both the concept and the constellation's ultimate usefulness. If a \nconstellation is highly useful with just one or two satellites, it offers a major advantage \nto the system developer. \n\nAnother advantage is that coverage requirements are rarely absolute. More cover-\nage is better than less, but we may not know at the time the constellation is designed \nhow useful added coverage will be. For example, we may design the FireSat system \nfor 30-min revisits, then later revise the response strategy so 45-min revisits can \nprovide nearly equal performance. Communications constellations are normally \nthought of as having a very rigid requirement of continuoUs global coverage. Even \nhere, however, they may want more coverage or greater redundancy over regions of \nhigh population density. \n\nA constellation of one or two planes can be more responsive to changing user needs \nthan a system with multiple planes can. Because we often design constellations many \nyears before many launch, we may not be able to correctly balance performance vs. \n\n7.6 Constellation Design 191 \n\ncost. Both needs and budgets follow political constraints and economic priorities over \nmuch shorter periods than a constellation's lifetime. Thus if an eight-satellite constel-\nlation is highly useful with only six satellites, budget constraints may delay the launch \nof the remaining two.* At the same time, the constellation may expand to ten satellites \nif the first set generates substantial demand for more performance or greater capacity. \nThis responsiveness to political and performance demands provides perhaRS the \nlargest advantage to constellations with a smaller number of orbit planes. \n\nFmally, a smaller number of orbit planes leads to more graceful degradation. In an \neight-satellite, two-plane constellation, if one satellite is lost for any reason. we may \nrephase the constellation at little propellant cost and thereby maintain a high perfor-\nmance level corresponding to a six-satellite plateau. This rephasing and graceful \ndegradation may be impossible for constellations with a large number of orbit planes. \n\nAnother important characteristic is the orbit inclination. In principle, one could \ndesign satellite constellations with many different inclinations to get the best coverage. \nIn practice this is extremely difficult because the rate of nodal regression for a satellite \norbit is a function of both altitude and inclination. Consequently, satellites at a \ncommon altitude but different inclinations will regress at different rates, and a set of \norbit planes which initially have a ~ven geometric relationship with respect to each \nother will change that relationship with time. Otherwise, we would have to expend \npropellant to maintain the relative constellation spacing, a technique that is extremely \nexpensive in terms of propellant 3Qd is achievable for only a short time or under. unique \ncircumstances. Thus, we usually design constellations to have all the satellites at the \nsame inclination. A possible exception is to have all satellites at a single inclination \nexcept for a set of satellites in a 0 inclination (equatorial) orbit. Regression of the \nnodes is not meaningful for the equatorial orbit, so we can maintain constant relative \nphasing indefinitely between satellites in equatorial and inclined orbits. An example \nof such a constellation is satellites in three mutually peipendicular orbit planes---two \npolar and one equatorial. \n\nAs shown in Fig. 7-10, the spacing between satellites in a single orbit plane \ndetermines whether coverage in that plane is continuous and the width of the COD-\ntinuous coverage region. Assume that ~ is the maximum Earth central angle as \ndefined in Sec. 5.3.1 and that there are N satellites equally spaced at S = 360IN deg \napart in a given orbit plane. There is intermittent coverage throughout a swath of half-\nwidth Amar If S > 2 Amax. the coverage is intermittent throughout the entire swath. If \nS < 2 Amax. there is a narrower swath, often called a street of coverage, centered on the \nground trace and of width 2 Astreep in which there is continuous coverage. This width \nis given by: \n\ncos Astreet = cos ~/cos (SI1:) (7-15) \n\nIf the satellites in adjacent planes are going in the same direction. then the \"bulge\" in \none orbit can be used to offset the \"dip\"in the adjacent orbit as shown in Fig. 7-11. In \nthis case, the maximum perpendicular separation, D1TIQXO between the orbit planes \nrequired for continuous coverage is \n\nD1IIIUS = Astreet + ~ (moving in the same direction) (7-16) \n\n\u2022 One hopes that proCuring agencies will not purposely select a rigid alternative to protect \nbudgets. \n\n\n\n192 , Orbit and ConsteDation Design \n\n\"Bulge\" \n\nStreet 01 \nCoverage \n\n7.6 \n\nFig. 7-10.

If the planes are moving in the same direction, the \noverlap pattem can be designed to provide maximum spacing between adjacent \nplanes. \n\nIf the satellites are moving in opposite directions, then the bulge and dip cannot be \nmade to line up continuously and, therefore, \n\nDmoxO= 2 Astreet (moving opposite directions) (7-17) \n\nThis leads to a polar constellation often called Streets of Coverage, illustrated in \nFig. 7-12, in which M planes of N satellites are used to provide continuous global \ncovemge. At any given time, satellites over half the world are going northward and sat-\nellites over the other half are going southward. Within both regions, the orbit planes \nare separated by DmaxS\u2022 Between the two halves there is a seam in which the satellites \nare going in opposite directions. Here the spacing between the planes must be reduced \nto DmoxO in order to maintain continuous covemge. \n\nThis pattern clearly shows another critical characteristic of constellations----cover-\nage does not vary continuously and smoothly with altitude.

To achieve full coverage, orbit planes on either side of the seam must be \ncloser together than the others. \n\njumps in covemge which depend primarily on \"-max which, in tum, depends on the \nminimum elevation angle, Emin' and the altitude (See Eqs. 5-35 and 5-36). If we keep \nEmin fixed and lower the constellation altitude, then we will reach an altitude plateau \nat which we will need to add another orbit plane, and N more satellites, to cover the \nEarth. The Iridium communications constellation was originally intended to have 77 \nsatellites in a streets of covemge pattern. (The element iridium has an atomic number \nof77.) By slightly increasing the .a1titude and decreasing the minimum elevation angle, \nthe number of orbit planes was reduced by one, and the number of satellites required \nfor continuous covemge was reduced to only 66. (Unfortunately, dysprosium is not a \ncompelling constellation name.) \n\nAs the altitude changes, the fundamental constellation design changes and, conse-\nquently, the number of satellites and covemge characteristics change in steps. As a \nresult, we cannot provide a meaningful chart of, for example, number of satellites vs. \naltitude without examining different constellation designs at different altitudes. While \nwe may use this sort of chart to estimate constellation size, it would not provide \nrealistic data for orbit design. \n\nRequirements other than covemge can also be important in constellation design, but \nmost are directly related to covemge issues. For example, we may need several satel-\nlites to cover a point on the ground or in space at the same time. Navigation with GPS \nrequires that four satellites be in view with a reasonably large angular sepamtion. A \nsimilar requirement is cross-link connectivity among satellites in the constellation. \nCross-link connectivity is geometrically the same issue as overlapping covemge. At \nany time when the covemge of two satellites overlaps (that is, they can both see at least \none common point on the ground), then the two satellites can see each other and we \ncan establish a cross-link. Thus, forming cross-links is equivalent to the problem of \nmultiple covemge. \n\nEven apparently simple design problems can be very difficult, with solutions \ndepending on various mission conditions. Perhaps the simplest constellation design \nproblem is the question \"What is the minimum number of satellites required to provide \n\n\n\n194 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.6 \n\ncontinuous coverage of the EarthT' In the late 1960s, Easton and Brescia [1969] of the \nUnited States Naval Research Laboratory analyzed coverage. by satellites in two \nmutually perpendicular orbit planes and concluded we would need at least six satellites \nto provide complete Earth coverage. In the 1970s, J.O. Walker [1971,1977,1984] at \nthe British Royal Aircraft Establishment expanded the types of constellations \nconsidered to include additional circular orbits at a common altitude and inclination. \nHe concluded that continuous coverage of the Earth would require five satellites. \nBecause of his extensive work, Walker constellations are a common set of \nconstellations to evaluate for overall coverage. More recently in the 1980s, John \nDraim [1985, 198730 1987b] found and patented a constellation of/our satellites in \nelliptical orbits which would provide continuous Earth coverage. A minimum of four \nsatellites are required at anyone instant to provide full coverage of the Earth. \nConsequently, while the above progression looks promising, the 1990s are unlikely to \nyield a three-satellite full Earth coverage constellation or the 2000s a two-satellite \nconstellation. \n\nWhile extensively studying regular, circular orbit patterns, Walker [1984] \ndeveloped a notation for labeling orbits that is commonly used in the orbit design \ncommunity and frequently used as a starting point for constellation design. Spe-\ncifically, the Walker delta pattern contains a total of t satellites with s satellites evenly \ndistributed in each of p orbit planes. All of the orbit planes are assumed to be at the \nsame inclination, i, relative to a reference plane--typically the Earth's equator. (For \nconstellation design purposes, this need not be the case. But orbit perturbations depend \non the inclination relative to the equator and, therefore, the equator is the most practi-\ncal standard reference plane.) Unlike the streets of coverage, the ascending nodes of \nthe p orbit planes in a Walker pattern are uniformly distributed around the equator at \nintervals of 360 deglp. Within each orbit plane the s satellites are uniformly distributed \nat intervals of 360 degls. \n\nThe only remaining issue is to specify the relative phase between the satellites in \nadjacent orbit planes. To do this we define the phase difference, 11q\" in a constellation \nas the angle in the direction of motion from the ascending node to the nearest satellite \nat a time when a satellite in the next most westerly plane is at its ascending node. In \norder for all of the orbit planes to have the same relationship to each other, 11q, must be \nan integral multiple,/, of 360 deglt, where/can be any integer from 0 to P - 1. So long \nas this condition holds, each orbit will bear the same relationship to the next orbit in \nthe pattern. The pattern is fully specified by giving the inclination and the three \nparameters, t, p, and f. UsualIy such a constellation will be written in the shorthand \nnotation of i: tlp/f. For example, Fig. 7-13 illustrates a Walker constellation of 151511 \nat i = 65 deg. Table 7-11 gives the general rules for Walker delta pattern parameters. \n\nWhile Walker constellations are important to constellation design, they are not the \nonly appropriate options and do not necesSarily provide the best characteristics for a \ngiven mission. Walker intended to provide continuous multiple coverage of all the \nEarth's surface with the smallest number of satellites. This plan may or may not meet \nall the goals of a particular program. For example, equally distributed coverage over \nthe Earth's surface may not be the most beneficial. We may wish to provide global \ncoverage with the best coverage at the poles, mid-latitude regions, or the equator. In \nthese cases, we may want constellation types other than Walker orbits. \n\nIf the regions of interest do not include the poles, then an equatorial constellation \nmay provide all of the coverage with a single orbit plane, which leads to flexibility, \nmultiple performance plateaus, and graceful degradation. Thus, for example, if all of \n\n-r \n7.6 Constellation Design 195 \n\nfig. 7-13. A 15/5/1 Walker ConsteDation at 65 deg IncDnation. Circles are centered on each \nof the 15 sateUites. The double circle is on a satellite at its ascending node. \n\nTABLE 7-11. Characteristics of a Walker Delta Pattem Constellation. See Walker [1984]. \n\nTIPIF - Walker Delta Patterns \n\nt = Number of satellites. \np = Number of orbit planes evenly spaced In node. \nf= Relative spacing between satellites in adjacent planes. \n\nDefine S EJ Vp = Number of satellites per plane (evenly spaced). \n\nDefine Pattem Unit. PU e 360 deglt. \n\nPlanes are spaced at Intervals of s PUS in node. \nSatellites are spaced at intervals of p PUs within each plane. \n\nIf a satellite Is at its ascending node, the next most easterly satellite wiD be f PUS past the node. \nf Is an integer which can take on any value from 0 to (p -1). \n\nExample: 1515/1 constellation shown in Rg. 7-13. \n15 sateDites In 5 planes (t= 15, p= 5). \n3 satellites per plane (s e Vp = 3). \nPU = 36OIt= 360115 = 24deg. \nIn-plane spacing between satellites = PU x P = 24 x 5 = 120 deg. \nNode spacing = PU x s = 24 x 3 = 72deg. \nPhase difference between adjacent planes:: PUx f= 24 x 1 = 24deg. \n\nthe regions of interest were within 50 deg of the equator, we would want to consider a \nconstellation having several equatorial satellites with enough altitude to provide the \nappropriate coverage at the smallest spacecraft elevation angle. \n\nIf all or most regions of interest are above a given latitude, a directly polar constel-\nlation would allow all satellites to see the region of the pole on every orbit Thus, if all \ntargets of interest were within 50 deg of the pole, a polar conste11ation with a single \norbit plane could provide excellent coverage. If most targets were in the polar region \n\n\n\n196 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.6 \n\nwith lesser interest in the equatorial regions, a two-plane polar constellation could \nprovide continuous or nearly continuous coverage of the pole while providing reduced \nbut good coverage of the equatorial regiQns. One might also consider a mix of polar or \nhigh inclination satellites with some satellites at the equator to provide the added \ncoverage needed there. \n\nAnother class of non-Wa1ker constellations consists of two planes at right angles to \neach other. If both planes are perpendicular to the equator it will be a polar constella-\ntion. Although it will have substantial symmetry, it is not one of the Wa1ker delta \npatterns. The two planes can also be tipped relative to the equator to achieve any \ninclination from 90 to 45 deg. Again the ascending nodes are such that they are not \nWa1ker constellations except when the inclination is 45 deg, in which case they reduce \nto a Walker two-plane configuration.

Sections 6.2 and 7.4 describe them in more detail. \nAs mentioned above, these constellations can fully cover high northern latitudes while \nrequiring much less energy than circular high-altitude orbits. \n\n7.6.2 Summary of Constellation Design \nConstellation design is complex, requiring us to assess many issues and orbit char-\n\nacteristics. We must certainly pick a preliminary design, but this complexity demands \nthat we document the reasons for that design and remain aware of alternatives as orbit \ndesign continues. Unfortunately, systematic reassessments of constellation design are \ndifficult under typical budget constraints and the constellation pattern is often locked \nin very early in mission design. \n\nUnfortunately, we cannot use analytic formulas to design a constellation. With \nnumerical simulation, we can evaluate some of the Figures of Merit defined in \nSec. 7.2. (That section discusses how to layout the simulation for unbiased results.) \nGenerally the results of such a simulation are best expressed as Figures of Merit vs. \nlatitude for the various performance plateaus. Thus, a typical decision plot might \ninclude mean response, percent coverage, and maximum gap as a function of latitude \nfor the various constellations being considered. Often, we must also evaluate coverage \ndata for different instruments on board a spacecraft. Each instrument has its own \ncoverage area and, therefore, a different swath width will apply for each principal \nobservation type. Thus, the coverage associated with one instrument may differ \ndramatically from that associated with another instrument or operating mode. Alterna-\ntive operating modes or instruments will likely lead us to prefer distinctly different \nconstellation designs. We may then choose either different satellites or a compromise \nbetween the alternative instruments or modes. \n\nTable 7-12 summarizes the constellation design process. Wertz 12001] provides a \nmuch more extended discussion of constellation design and techniques for evaluating \nthe factors involved. Mora et al. [1997] provide an excellent chronological summary \nof constellation design methods. As with single-satellite orbits, we normally start by \nassuming circular orbits at a common altitude. Depending upon the coverage \nrequirements, I recommend beginning with either the Wa1ker delta orbits, the one-\nplane equatorial, or streets of coverage polar orbits. We should also consider elliptical \norbits, either as a full constellation or to fill in missing coverage. Generally, we \nevaluate each constellation design for three criteria: \n\n\u2022 Baseline Coverage vs. lAtitude \n\nThe coverage associated with different instruments or operating modes is best \nexpressed as coverage vs. latitude (see Sees. 7.2.2 and 7.2.3). I regard the mean \nresponse time as the best overall measure of coverage, although percent \ncoverage and maximum gap can also be important in some applications. We \nmust use the maximum gap measure carefully because this single point should \nnot be allowed to drive the design of an entire constellation as it will typically \nnot provide the best overall performance for the cost. \n\n\u2022 Growth and Degradation \n\nAs described in See. 7.6.1, this is a key issue in practical constellation design. \nIt will be different for each constellation type. In evaluating growth and deg-\nradation we should assume that rephasing within the orbit plane can be done at \nvery modest propellant cost, and that changing orbit planes is not feasible. \n\n\n\n198 Orbit and Constellation Design 7.6 \n\nTABLE 7-12.

Review the rules of constellation design In Table 7-13. Table 7-13 \n\n7. Document reasons for choices and iterate. \n\n\u2022 Existence of Altitude Plateaus \nWe should evaluate each constellation to see if plateaus exist in which the \nnumber of orbit planes or other key characteristics make a discrete step. Pla-\nteaus may be different for different instruments and operating modes, but usu-\nally are functions of the swath width for each instrument or operating mode. \n\nThere are no absolute rules for choosing the proper constellation. Selection is based \non the relative importance of the various factors to the owners and users of the \nconstellation. A summary of the most common rules and the reason for them is given \nin Table 7-13. As with all aspects of mission design, we must document our selection, \nour reasons, and the coverage characteristics. It is critical to keep in mind possible \nalternatives and to reevaluate orbits with advances. in mission definition and \nrequirementS. \n\nFinally, one of the most important characteristics of any constellation is collision \navoidance. The reason for this is not merely the loss of the satellites which collide \nbecause we anticipate losing satellites for many reasons in any large constellation. The \nfundamental problem is the debris cloud that results from any satellite collision. The \nvelocity imparted to the particles resulting from the collision is small relative to the \norbital velocity. Consequently, the net effect of a collision is to take two trackable, \npossibly controllable satellites and transform them into thousands of untrackable \n\n1.6 Constellation Design \n\nTABLE 7-13. Rules for ConstellaUon Design. WhUe there are no absolute rules, these broad \nguidelines are appllca!Jle to most constellations. \n\nWhere \nRule Discussed \n\n1. To avoid differential node rotation, all satellites should be at the same Sec. 6.2.2 \nInclination, except that an equatorial orbit can be added. \n\n2. To avoid perigee rotation, all eccentric orbits should be at the critical Sec. 6.2.2 \ninclination of 63.4 deg. \n\n3. Collision avoidance Is critical, even for dead satellites, and may be a Table 7-14 \ndriving characteristic for constellation design. \n\n4. Symmetry Is an important, but not critical element of constellation Sec. 7.6.1 \ndesign. \n\n5. Altitude Is typlcaHy the most important of the orbit elements, followed by Sees. 7.4, 7.6.1 \nInclination. Zero eccentricity Is the most common, although eccentric \norbits can improve some coverage and sampling characteristics. \n\n6. Minimum working elevation angle (which determines swath width) Is as Sec. 5.2, \nimportant as the altitude In determlng coverage. Rg.5-21 \n\n7. l\\vo satellites can see each other if and only if they are able to see the Sec. 7.6.1 \nsame point on the ground. \n\n8. PrIncipal coverage Rgures of Merit for constellations: Sec. 7.2 \n\u2022 Percentage of time coverage goal Is met \n\u2022 Number of satellites required to achieve the needed coverage \n\u2022 Mean and maximum response times (for non-continuous coverage) \n\u2022 Excess coverage percent \n\u2022 Excess coverage vs.latitude \n\n9. Size of stationkeeping box is determined by the mission ObJectives, the [Wertz, 2001) \nperturbations selected to be overcome, and the method of control. \n\n10. For long-term constellations, absolute stationkeeping provides [Wertz, 2001) \nsigniffcant advantages and no disadvantages compared to relative \nstationkeeplng. \n\n11. Orbit perturbations can be treated In 3 ways: [Wertz, 2001) \n\u2022 Negate the perturbing force (use only when necessary) \n\u2022 Control the perturbing force (best approach if control required) \n\u2022 Leave perturbation uncompensated {best for cyclic perturbations} \n\n12. Performance plateaus for the number of orbit planes required are a Sec. 7.6.1 \nfunction of the altitude. \n\n13. Changing position within the orbit plane is easy; changing orbit planes Sec.7.6.1 \nis hard; implies that a smaller number of orbit planes is better. \n\n14. Constellation build-up, graceful degradation, filling In for dead sateDites, Sec. 7.6.2 \nand end-of-Iife disposal are critical and should be addressed as part of \nconstellation design. \n\n15. Taking satellites out of the constellation at end-of-life is critical for Sees. 6.5, 7.6.2 \nlong-term success and risk avoidance. This Is done by: \n\u2022 Deorbltlng satellites In LEO \n\u2022 RaIsing them above the constellation above LEO (Including GEO) \n\n\n\n200 Orbit and ConsteDadon Design 7.6 \n\nparticles that spread out with time in the same orbits as the original satellites. \nBecause the energy is proportional to mv2, even a small piece of a satellite carries an \nenormous amount of kinetic energy at orbital velocities.\u00b7 Because the debris cloud re-\nmains in the constellation orbit, it dramatically increases the potential for secondary \ncollisions which, in tum, continues to increase the amount of debris and the possibility \nof making the orbit \"uninhabitable.\" The implication for constellation design is that \nwe should go to great lengths to design the constellation and the spacecraft to avoid \ncollisions, explosions, or generation of extraneous debris.

We~ Microcosm, Inc. \n\nThe near-Earth space and atmospheric environments strongly influence the per-\nformance and lifetime of operational space systems by affecting their size, weight, \ncomplexity, and cost. Some environmental interactions also limit the technical poten-\ntial of these systems. They can lead to costly malfunctions or even the loss of compo-\nnents or subsystems [Tribble, 1995; Hastings and Garrett, 1996; DeWitt et al., 1993]. \n\nBy itself, operating under vacuum-like conditions can pose significant problems for \nmany spacecraft systems. When under vacuum, most organic materials will outgas \n-the generation of spurious molecules which may act as contaminants to other \nsurfaces. Even before reaching orbit, particles from the atmosphere may fall onto \noptical surfaces and degrade the performance of electro-optical instrumentation. \nBecause there is no practical way to clean spacecraft surfaces once the vehicle reaches \norbit, maintaining effective contamination control during design and development is a \nsignificant issue for most spacecraft [Tribble et al., 19%]. \n\nOnce orbit is obtained, the spacecraft is subjected to a very tenuous atmosphere \n[Tascione, 1994]. At lower orbits a spacecraft will be bombarded by the atmosphere \nat orbital velocities on the order of -8 kmls. Interactions between the satellite and the \nneutral atmosphere can erode satellite surfaces, affect the thermal and electrical \nproperties of the surface, and possibly degrade spacecraft structures. \n\n203 \n\n\n\n204 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.1 \n\nAt shuttle altitudes, -300 kIn, about 1 % of the atmosphere is ionized. This fraction \nincreases to essentially 100% ionization in the geosynchronous environment The \npresence of these charged particles, called the plasma environment, can cause differ-\nential charging of satellite components on the surface and interior of the vehicle. If \nsevere, this charging can exceed breakdown electric fields and the resulting electro-\nstatic discharges may be large enough to disrupt electronic components. More energet-\nic space mdiation, such as electrons with energies from about 200 ke V to 15 MeV \ncan become embedded in dielectric components and produce electrostatic discharg~ \nin cable insulation and circuit boards. This bulk clwrging may disrupt a subsystem's \nsignals or the operation of its devices. Even if mild, the charging may alter the electri-\ncal potential of the spacecraft relative to space and affect the opemtion of scientific \ninstrumentation. \n\nVery energetic (MeV -Ge V) charged particles can be found in the trapped radiation \nbelts, solar flare protous, and galactic cosmic rays. The total dose effects of this high-\nenergy radiation can degrade microelectronic devices, solar arrays, and sensors. A \nsingle energetic particle can also cause single-event phenomena within micro-\nelectronic devices which can temporarily disrupt or permanently damage components. \n\nLastly, orbiting spacecraft are periodically subjected to hypervelocity impacts by \n1 J1IIl or larger sized pieces of dust and debris. If the impacting particles originate in \nnature they are termed micrometeoroids.1f the particles ~ man-made they are termed \norbital debris. A single collision with a large micrometeoroid or piece of orbital debris \ncan terminate a mission. The probability of this occurring will increase significantly \nwith the introduction of large constellations of satellites. \n\nThe subject of space environment effects is, by itself, an area of active research. \nThe more critical of the various effects are discussed below . \n\n8.1.1 The Solar Cycle \n\nThis subject is of particular interest because of the fact that the solar activity is seen \nto vary with an ll-year cycle as shown in Fig. 8-1 [NOAA, 1991). The plot shows the \nFlO.7 index, which is the mean daily flux at 10.7 em wavelength in units of 10-22 \nW/m2 \u2022 Hz. The peaks in the FI0.7 index are called solar maxima, while the valleys \nare called solar minima. Note that the variations are substantial on a day-to-day basis \nand that one solar maximum may have levels that vary dramatically from other solar \nmaxima. Consequently, predicting the level at any given future time is highly \nuncertain. On the other hand, the avenge over an extended period of time is well \nknown. As will be seen, many space environment effects are strongly dependent on \nthe solar cycle. \n\n, \n8.1.2 The Gravitational Field and Microgravity* \n\nMicrogravity, also called weightlessness, free fall, or zero-g, is the nearly complete \nabsence of any of the effects of gravity. In the microgravity environment of-a satellite, \nobjects don't fall. particles don't settle out of solution, bubbles don't rise, and convec-\ntion CUITents don't occur. Yet in low-Earth orbit, where all of these phenomena occur, \nthe gravitational force is about 90% of its value at the Earth's surface. Indeed, it is the \ngravitational field that holds the satellite in its orbit. \n\n* Contributed by James R.

In a circular orbit the forward velocity of the spacecraft (tangential to the \ndirection to the Earth) is just enough that the continual falling of the spacecraft toward \nthe Earth keeps the satellite at the same distance from the Earth's center. Moving in a \ncircular orbit requires a continuous accelention toward the center. \n\nThe term microgravity is used in the space environment because, in practice, zero \ngravity cannot actually be achieved. Two objects traveling very near each other in \norbit will not travel in quite the same path due to differences in the gravirlltional forces \nor external nongravitational forces acting on them. Two objects held side by side lqId \ndropped from a tall building will both accelerate toward the center of the Earth and, as \nthey fall, will converge slightly toward each other. From the point of view of the \nobjeets, there is a small component of Earth gravity that pulls them toward each other. \nAn orbiting spacecraft under the influence of atmospheric drag or solar radiation pres-\nsure will feel a very small force due to this external pressure. This force can mimic the \neffect of gravity, causing heavy particles in solution to settle toward the front end of a \nmoving spacecraft. Similarly, a rotating spacecraft produces \"artificial gravity\" due to \ncentrifugal force. Fmally, tidal forces, sometimes called gravity-gradient forces, come \nabout because of very small differences in the force of gravity over an extended object \nFor a spherical bubble drifting in orbit, the force of gravity on the lower edge of the \nbubble will be stronger than at the center of mass and weaker at the far edge of the \nbubble. This very small difference in forces results in ''tides'' which will distort the \nshape of the bubble and elongate it toward and away from the direction to the Earth. \n\nFor most practical applications, microgravity effects in low-Earth orbit can be \nreduced to the level of 10-6 g (= 1 p.g). A level of 1<r7 g can be achieved over a very \nsmall region near the center of mass of the spacecraft. Table 8-1 provides formulas for \nthe most common forces in the microgravity environment In this table, z is the . \ndirection toward nadir and Z is the acceleration in the nadir direction. (J) is the angular \nvelocity of the satellite in its orbit Note that for a nadir-pointing spacecraft, the space-\ncraft rotates in inertial space at a rate of one rotation per orbit and thus will add to the \nacceleration environment due to the centrifugal force of this rotation. In low-Earth \n\n\n\n206 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.1 \n\norbit, the lowest microgravity level can be achieved in an inertially-oriented spacecraft \nrather than a nadir-oriented spacecraft. The last row in Table 8-1 is the coriolis force \nwhich is an ap~nt sidewise force that occurs whenever objects move (e.g., fluid \nflow in a chemical process) in a rotating reference frame, such as a gravity-gradient \nstabilized spacecraft. . \n\nTABLE 8-1.

This gives an idea of the scale over which specific micro-\ngravity values can be obtained. Microgravity levels could be substantially lowered by \nconducting microgravity experiments well away from the vicinity of the Earth or other \nlarge objects. \n\nMicrogravity leads to a wide variety of chemical and manufacturing processes that \ncannot occur on the surface of the Earth. Heavier particles in a solution do not settle \nout and bubbles do not rise to the surface. This allows uniform, universal mixing and \npermits chemical reactions to occur that could not occur on Earth because separation \nor weight collapse would hinder completion of the reaction or hardening of the \nmaterial. Surface tension and other inter-molecular forces can take over that would \n\n8.1 The Space Environment 207 \n\notherwise be dominated by gravitational settling. Similarly, convection does not occur \nin space and heated materials do not churn or boil. This allows differential heating to \ntake place to provide other chemical reactions. Because settling does not occur, very \nlarge crystals can be formed in space which have a variety of industrial applications. \nContainer less processing and working in the vacuum of space can lead to extrem~ly \npure chemicals for use in both pharmaceuticals and manufacturing. Microgravity is a \nwhole new science which is just beginiling to evolve. \n\n8.1.3 The Upper Atmosphere* \nThe upper atmosphere affects spacecraft by generating aerodynamic drag lift and \n\nheat, and through the chemically corrosive effects of highly reactive elements such as \natomic oxygen. The effects of aerodynamic lift and heating are important during \nlaunch and reentry. AerodyDamic drag is addressed in Sec. 6.2.3. \n\nDrag depends on the ballistic coefficient (which is a function of atmospheric com-\nposition and temperature), velocity relative to the wind, and atmospheric density. We \ncan either estimate the ballistic coefficient based on the configuration of the space-\ncraft, or bound the problem using typical upper and lower limits as shown in Table 8-3. \n\nTABLE 8-3.

At this altitude, perturbations in orbital period are \nso slight that we can easily account for them without accurate knowledge of the atmo-\nspheric density. At intennediate altitudes, roughly two variable energy sources cause \nlarge variations in atmospheric density and generate orbital perturbations.cThese vari-\nations can be predicted with two empirical models: the Mass Spectrometer Incoherent \nScatter (MSIS) and the Jacchia models [Hedin, 1986; Jacchia, 1977]. \n\nAltitudes between 120 and 600 Ion are within the Earth's thermosphere, the region \nabove 90 Ion where the absorption of extreme ultraviolet radiation from the Sun results \nin a very rapid increase in temperature with altitude. At -200-250 Ion, this tem-\nperature approaches a limiting value, called the exospheric temperature, the average \nvalues of which range between -600 and 1,200 K over a typical solar cycle. The ther-\nmosphere. may also be strongly heated from geomagnetic activity, which transfers \nenergy from the magnetosphere and ionosphere. Heating of the thermosphere \nincreases atmospheric density because the thermosphere's expansion causes increased \npressure at fIxed altitudes. \n\nHeating due to extreme ultraviolet radiation and its solar cycle variation has the \ngreatest effect on satellite lifetimes. Geomagnetic disturbances are generally too brief \nto signifIcantly affect lifetimes. Extreme ultraviolet radiation from the Sun is com-\npletely absorbed before it reaches the ground and is not measured routinely by \nsatellite-borne instruments; consequently, its effects are unpredictable. Solar activity \nis monitored using such proxy indices as sunspot number and the FIO.7 index which \nwas previously discussed. \n\nFigures 8-1 to 8-4 provide a means of estimating satellite lifetimes based on the \ninformation available to the mission designer. Figure 8-2 provides the atmospheric \ndensity as a function of altitude corresponding to various values of the FIO.7 index. \nDensities were obtained from the MSIS atmospheric model [Hedin, 1986]. Below \nabout 150 Ion, the density is not strongly affected by solar activity. However, at \nsatellite altitudes in the range of 500 to 800 Ion, the density variations between solar \nmaximum and solar minimum are approximately 2 orders of magnitude. \n\nThe large variations in density imply that satellites will decay more rapidly during \nperiods of solar maxima and much more slowly during solar minima. This is clearly \ndemonstrated in Fig. 8-3 which shows the altitude as a function of date for a set of9 \nhypothetical satellites launched over a 6-year period. We aSsume that all of the satel-\nlites were launched in a perfectly circular orbit at 700 Ion a1titude-3 in 1956 at the \nbeginning of a solar maximum, 3 in 1959 toward the end of the solar maximum, and \n3 in 1962 near the time of solar minimum. In each group one satellite had a ballistic \ncoefficient. of 20 kg/r02, one was at 65 kg/m2, and one at 200 kg/m2\u2022 The histories of \nthe 9 satellites are shown in the graph. \n\nSeveral characteristics of satellite decay are easily seen in Fig. 8-3. Satellites decay \nvery little during solar minimum, and then rapidly during solar maximum. For one \nsatellite, each solar maximum period will generally produce larger decay than the \nprevious maximum because the satellite is lower. It will, of course, depend on the level \nof the particular solar maximum. The effect of the solar maxima will also depend on \nthe satellite ballistic coefficient. Those with a low ballistic coefficient will respond \nquickly to the atmosphere and will tend to decay promptly. Those with high ballistic \ncoefficients will push through a larger number of solar cycles and will decay much \n\n8.1 The Space Environment \n\n10-IIII \n\n10-00 \nC \n\n~ 10-'0 \n~ 10-\" \n!l \nIII \n\n10-'2 C \nCD \nC \n\n10-'6 \n100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1,000 \n\nAltitude (km) \n\nFig. 8-2.

The 3 sets of curves show lifetime as a function of initial circular altitude for \nsatellites with ballistic coefficients that are low (20 kglm2), moderate (65 kglm2), and \nhigh (200 kglm2). The spread in the curves near the middle represents the difference \nbetween solar maximum (F1O.7 = 225) and solar minimum (FI0.7 = 75). At the left of \nthe figure, below about 200 km, satellite orbits decay within a few days, the abna. \nspheric density is largely independent of the solar cycle (see Fig. 8-11), and the upper \nand lower curves for each coefficient begin to merge. From there to lifetimes of about \nhalf a solar cycle (approximately 5 years) there will be a very strong difference \nbetween satellites launched at the start of solar minimum (upper curve) and those \nlaunched at the start of solar maximum (lower curve). Also note that the difference \nbetween the solar maximum and solar minimum curves is 1arger for satellites with a \nlower ballistic coefficient as we would expect. (Balloons respond to drag more than \nbowling balls do.) After about half a solar cycle, satellites on the upper curve of each \npair will hit solar maximum and the curve will become much flatter. In contrast, those \non the lower curve will hit solar minimum and will nearly stop decaying such that the \ncurve becomes nearly vertical. This oscillatory pattern continues with a frequency of \nthe II-year solar cycle as can be seen in the upper portion of the curves. FmaUy at high \naltitudes and long lifetimes the curves come together because the satellite will see a \nlarge number of solar cycles and it will make very little difference when the satellite \nstarts. of course the actual lifetime for any particular satellite will depend on both the \nactual FlO. 7 index variations and the design and attitude history of the satellite. None-\ntheless, Fig. 8-13 provides an estimate of the extrema for use in mission design and \ncan be used to estimate the lifetime for a specific satellite if the ballistic coefficient and \nlaunch date relative to the solar cycle are know. \n\nAtomic oxygen-the predominant abnospheric constituent from -200 km to \n-600 km-is another important part of the upper abnosphere's effect on space \nsystems. This form of oxygen can react with thin organic films, advanced composites, \nand metallized surfaces [Visentine, 1988], resulting in degraded sensor performance. \nFor example, Kapton, a material commonly used for insulation and seals, erodes at a \nrate of approximately 2.8 J.1.lll for every 1024 atomslm2 of atomic oxygen fluence \n[Leger et al., 1984]. The fluence, lb, over a time interval 1; is given by \n\nlb=~IT ~) \n\nwhere PH is the number density of atomic oxygen (see Fig. 8-5), and V is the satellite \nvelocity. (See tables on inside rear cover.) In addition, chemical reactions involving \natomic oxygen may produce radiatively active, excited constituents which, in tum, \nemit significant amounts of background radiation, create effects such as \"Shuttle \nglow,\" and interfere with optical sensors . \n\nAtomic oxygen forms when solar ultraviolet radiation dissociates molecular \noxygen. Above 110 km, abnospheric constituents diffuse, and each constituent's \ndensity varies with altitude according to its scale height. The scale height of a \nconstituent is the height change over which the density drops to lie of its value. In \ndiffusive equilibrium, the scale height is inversely proportional to its molecular \nweight. Thus, the density of light constituents decreases less rapidly with altitude than \nthe density of heavy constituents, and eventuaUy the\u00b7 light constituents dominate the \nmixture of gases. Atomic oxygen is lighter than the molecular nitrogen and oxy-\ngen; therefore, near -170 km altitude, atomic oxygen becomes the most abundant \nconstituent. \n\n\n\n212 The Space En'Yironment.and Survivability \n\nBOO \n\n600 \n\n200 \n\nF10.7=50 \nF10.7 = 250 \n\nO~~~-L~~~~~-L~~~. \n107 1012 1017 1()22 \n\nNumber Density (alDmslm3) \n\n8.1 \n\nFig. 8-5. AltItude Profiles of Number Density of Atomic Oxygen at Solar Minimum (Sond \nUne) and Solar Maximum (Dashed Une). \n\nFigure 8-5 shows altitude profiles of atomic oxygen number density over the \nequator for FIO.7 values of 50 and 250. These values represent the extremes for solar \nminimum and maximum, respectively. The profiles are based on predictions from the \nMSIS model [Hedin, 1986) for 3 p.m.local time at northern hemisphere equinox and \nfor geomagneticaIly quiet conditions [Walterscheid, 1989). Up to 150 km, the solar-\ncycle variation is small, but it increases steadily with increasing altitude. By 300 kIn, \nthe number density of atomic oxygen at solar maximum becomes an order of magni-\ntude greater than at solar minimum. \n\nThe large solar-cycle variation in atomic oxygen means spacecraft materials can be \nselected based on phasing the mission to the solar cycle. Since there are large differ-\nences between solar cycles, material choices made on the basis of average solar max-\nimum conditions may be inappropriate because of the possibility of more extreme \nsolar maximum conditions. \n\n8.1.4 Plasmas, The Magnetic Field, and Spacecraft Charging-\n\nThe Earth's magnetic field is roughly dipolar; that is, \n\nB(R),) = (1 + sin2 A)ll2 BoIR3 (8-2) \nwhere B is the local magnetic field intensity, A. is the magnetic latitude, R is the radial \ndistance measured in Earth radii (RE), and Bo is the magnetic field at the equator at the \nEarth's swface [Bo = B(R = RE, A. = 0) = 0.30 gauss]. \n\nAs shown in Fig. 8-6, the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's \nmagnetic field causes magnetic field on the night side of the Earth to stretch into a very \nelongated structure known as the magnetotail (see Tsyganenko [1987] for a more \ncomplete model of the Earth's magnetic field). A thin plasma sheet bifurcates the \nmagnetotail, which extends over 1,000 Earth radii paraIlel to the flow velocity of the \nsolar wind. \n\n\u2022 Contributed by H. C.

A Cross SectIon of the Earth's Magnetosphere. It shows the key plasma and \nenergetic particle populations which respond to variations in solar wind parameters. \n\nThrough the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetic'field, \nsome of the solar wind's kinetic energy is converted to magnetic energy stored in the \nmagnetotail. Because this energy cannot build up indefinitely, magnetic substorms \ndissipate it from time to time. These substorms produce an energized plasma (5 to \n50 ke V) that is injected toward the Earth. This hot plasma can extend into geosynchro-\nnous orbits, charging the swface of any spacecraft within it to high negative voltages. \n\nThe electrical potential of a spacecraft or component is measured with respect to \nthe plasma in which it is immersed where the net current flow is zero. That is, the \nfollowing currents must cancel each other: (1) the electron current from the plasma to \nthe vehicle, (2) the ion current from the plasma to the vehicle, (3) the secondary elec-\ntron current, (4) the backscattered electron current, and (5) the photoelectron current. \nThe voltage at the component's surface also depends on the material's capacitance \nwith respect to the surrounding materials, especially the vehicle ground. \n\nBecause materials have varying secondary emission coefficients and photoelectron \ncurrents, their equilibrium potentials also differ. An electrostatic arc occurs if the elec-\ntric field exceeds the breakdown field along the surface of the material, through the \nmaterial, or between adjacent materials. Electromagnetic interference, EMI, from \nsuch arcs can cause spacecratyto operate erratically [Robinson, 1989). \n\nSurface charging detrimental to vehicle operation occurs mainly in orbits where \nelectrons with energies of 10 to 20 ke V dominate the electron current from the plasma \nto the vehicle. At low altitudes this charging occurs only at high latitudes where \nauroral electrons collide with the vehicle which is passing through an otherwise cold, \nlow-density plasma [Gussenhoven et aI., 1985]. For other low-altitude locations, low-\nenergy electrons usually develop enough current to keep electric fields below \nbreakdown levels. \n\nIn higher orbits, such as geosynchronous, swface charging occurs during mag-\nnetospheric substorms between the longitudes corresponding to midnight and dawn \n[Fennell et \u00b7aI., 1983]. We can approximate the electron-flux distribution during a \nsubstorm.by summirig a cold and a hot Maxwellian distribution. The cold component \nhas a density of 0.2 cnr3 and a temperature of 0.4 keY; the hot component has a \n\n\n\n214 The Space Environment and Survivability \n\ndensity of about 2.3 cor3 and a temperature of 25 keY [Mullen et aI., 1981]. We must \ndesign spacecraft which either keep the differential charging caused by this plasma \nwell below breakdown potentials, or can tolerate the resulting electrostatic discharges. \n\nDesign guidelines are available to help reduce differential potentials on vehicle \nsurfaces [Purvis et aI., 1984; Vampola et aI., 1985]. For example, we can select candi-\ndate materials and conductive coatings, apply numerical or analytical models using \ntheir quantifiable characteristics, and determine their differential potentials in space. \nIT we cannot prevent discharges by selecting alternative materials, we might consider \nalternatives such as special filtering, cabling, or grounding. We can employ coupling \nmodels for electromagnetic interference simulation, and test the vehicle for electro-\nstatic discharges in its flight configuration. _ \n\nIt is important to note that while differential charging as discussed in the preceding \nparagraphs is not seen in lower equatorial orbits, the spacecraft potential may be as \nmuch as 90% of the solar array voltage more negative than that of the surrounding \nplasma depending on the configuration of the spacecraft electrical power supply. This \nmay be a concern on scientific missions, where nonbiased measurements of the plasma \nenvironment are desired, and may also give rise to arcing or other undesirable effects \nifhigh voltage power supplies are used [Tribble, 1995]. \n\n8.1.5 Radiation and Associated Degradation \n\nTrapped Radiotion\u00b7 \n\nThe Van Allen radiation belts are a permanent hazard to orbiting spacecraft. They \nconsist of electrons and ions (mostly protons) having energies greater than 30 ke V and \nare distributed nonuniformly within the magnetosphere. As illustrated in Fig. 8-7, the \nenergetic electrons preferentially populate a pair of toroidal regions centered on the \nmagnetic shells L - 1.3 (inner zone) and L - 5 (outer zone). \n\nRg. 8-7.

It approximately satisfies the equation \n\nR = L cos2 A (8-3) \nwhere R is the distance in Earth radii from the idealized point dipole near the Earth's \ncenter, and A is the magnetic latitude. Thus, the L value of a dipolar magnetic shell is \nits equatorial radius measured in Earth radii. A generaIized concept of L, introduced \nby McDwain [1961], takes account of the way higher harmonics of the main \ngeomagnetic field perturb the motion ?f charged ~cles from their dipolar.trajec-\ntories. Normally, we use this concept Instead of the dipole L value for mapp~g the \ntrapped radiation environment. Standard models of the Van ~en bel!S m:. available \nfrom the National Space Science Data Center. The model which proVides Inner zone \n(L = 1.2 - 2.4) electron data is AE8, which has an average energy range of 40 keY to \n5 MeV [Bilitza et aI., 1988]. AES has two forms, AESMIN and AESMAX, which \nrepresent the time-averaged environments during solar minimum and maximum. \n\nOuter-zone electron fluxes vary much more over time than inner-zone fluxes. \nIndeed, during a major magnetic storm, the equatorial intensity at a given energy and \nL value may grow by several orders of magnitude (factors of 10) in less than a day. \nBetween storms, such flux enhancements usually decay exponentially with an energy-\ndependent lifetime 't' - 10 E(MeV) days at L > 3. . .' \n\nAvailable proton models are APSMIN and APSMAX, which also represent the \nsolar minimum and maximum periods. At solar maximum, the increased atmospheric \ndensities decrease the proton fluxes because the trapped protons collide with the \natmosphere at low altitudes. The APS models cover the energy range from 100 ke V to \n> 400 MeV. Figure 8-8 shows soine of APSMIN's typical contours for proton fluxes \nin (R. A) space. Since the MIN model predicts slightly more flux than the MAX model, -\nit can be used during solar maximum or as a conservative model for long-term \nmissions. \n\nProtons \nE~100MeV \n\nRg. 8-8.

Secular variations in the \nEarth's magnetic field drive the normally stable energetic protons toward low~ \naltitudes and the models do not take this into account.

Radiation Dose Rates as a Function of Altitude for Low-Altitude Polar Orbits. \nDose rates are shown for several shielding depths. \n\nfield more than 10-15 years into the future, our calculations will be invalid for low-\naltitude orbits [Konradi and Hardy, 1987]. The present and future configurations of the \ninner-zone proton belt probably will not differ much, provided both are described in \nterms of Land A. \n\nWe can determine the appropriate amount of shielding for future spacecraft by \ncomputing the dose rate for the desired orbit as a function of shield thickness. To do \nso, we must apply a radiation transport computation to the time-averaged space \nenvironment. Figure 8-9 shows how various shielding depths affect radiation doses in \nlow-altitude polar orbits. Figure 8-10 shows results for geosynchronous satellites. A \nrad is that amount of radiation which deposits 100 ergs (= 6.25 X 107 MeV) per gram \nof target material (100 mils of aluminum is equivalent to 0.686 glcm2). The total \nradiation dose consists of three components: proton dose, electron dose, and \nbremsstrahlung X-ray dose produced by the interaction of electrons with the shielding \nmaterial. In low-Earth orbits, energetic protons in the inner radiation belt contribute \nmost to the total radiation dose. Radiation. dose strongly depends on altitude; below \n1,000 km the dose increases at approximately the 5th power of the altitude. At \nsynchronous altitude the greater than 5 MeV proton dose is negligible and the \nbremsstrahlung dose dominates the electron dose for shield thicknesses greater than \n1 em. \n\nFigure 8-10 illustrates that protons trapped near a geosynchronous orbit do not have \nenough energy to penetrate 10 mils of aluminum. Nevertheless, many trapped protons \nand heavier ions in this region of space have energies around 10-200 keV. These \nlower-energy ions can harm space systems differently than penetrating radiation. By \ndepositing their energy in the spacecraft skin, the lower-energy ions can cause a tem-\nperature rise sufficient to significantly enhance the infrared background. Heat loads of \nup to 0.5 W/m2 are possible. These same low-energy ions can degrade the effective-\nness of paints and protective glass ~y breaking chemical bonds in their surface layers. \nWe cannot shield against these effects. \n\n8.1 The Space Environment 217 \n\n1~ L--L~_L~ __ L~\\~~~~~ __ ~~~~ \n10 100 1,000 10,000 \n\nShield ThIckness (mU - aluminum) \n\nFig. 8-10.

The practical Importance of an mdiVldual \nevent depends on its maximum intensity, its duration, and the relative abundance of \nthe higbest-energy components and heavy n11:clei. . \n\nThe frequency of proton events peaks within a year or two of sunspot maxunum and \ndiminishes greatly during the few years surrounding sunspot minimum. Nevertheless, \nintense events can occur virtually any time within the II-year sunspot cycle except at \nsunspot minimum. Table 8-4 shows when the most and fewest sunspots will occur for \nsolar cycles 21-25. \n\nThe intensities of typical solar proton events closely follow a log-normal distribu-\ntion [Jursa, 1985; King, 1974; Feynman et al., 1988); thus, a few individual events can \ndominate the total proton fluence observed over a comp!ete solar cycl~.

Energy Spectra for Several Elements of Galactic Cosmic Rays. The energy for \nhydrogen has been multiplied by a factor of 5 to distinguish it from the heDum curve. \n\nCosmic rays pose a serious hazard because a single particle can cause a malfunction \nin common electronic components such as random access memory, microprocessors, \nand henet power transistors. When a single passing particle causes this malfunction, \nwe call radiation effects single-event phenomena, or SEP. \n\nA galactic cosmic ray loses energy mainly by ionization. This energy loss depends \nchiefly on the square of the particle's charge, Z. and can be increased if the particle \n\n\n\n220 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.1 \n\nundergoes nuclear interactions within an electronic part. Thus, lower-Z (and more \nabundant) ions ~it as much energy in a device as less abundant, higher-Z ions. \nWhen the galactic cosmic ray leaves electron-hole pairs in a depletion region of an \nelectronic device, the electric field in that region sweeps up the pairs. Figure 8-14 \nshows this process schematically. \n\nFast Charged \nParUcle \n\nEnergetic \nProton \n\nDepletion Raglon lii*i!jj\\i'l-q! \n\nRg.8-14. Schematic Showing How Galactic Cosmic Rays Deposit Energy In an Elec-\ntronic Device. \n\nSingle~event phenomena include three different effects in electronic components. \nThe first IS the so-called bitflip, or single-event upset (SEU), which neither damages \nthe part nor inu:neres with its sub8e9uent operation. The second is single-event latch-\nup (SEL). In this case, the part hangs up, draws excessive current, and will no longer \noperate until the power to the device is turned off and then back on. The excessive \ncurrent drawn in the latched condition can destroy the device if the power supply \ncannot ~andle the current. When latchup demands too much current for the power \nsupply, It may drag down the bus voltage, or even damage supply. The third effect is \nsingle-event burnout (SEB). This causes the device to fail permanently. \n\nTo evaluate the frequency of single-event phenomena for a given part, we must \nknow three things: the external environment; how the incident energy spectrum and \nparticle intensity change as a particle passes through the spacecraft to the sensitive \ndevice; and how the electronic device responds to ionizing radiation. We find these \nphenomena difficult to evaluate because of the complex interactions between the radi-\nation environment and the device's circuit elements. On-orbit failure rates can be \npredicted primarily for single-event upsets in memory devices, with well defined \nsensitive volumes, in which the galactic cosmic rays produce electron-hole pairs. A \nuseful equation developed by Petersen [1995] expresses the upset rate R as follows: \n\n(8-4) \n\nwhere R is the number of upsets or errors per bit day, (J L is the limiting cross section \n(sensitive area) of the device in cm2, and Lo.25 is the linear energy transfer (LET) at \n25% of the limiting cross section in units of MeV/mglcm2. H experimental cross \nsection data is not available, but device modeling data is, then geometric data can be \nused in conjunction with the predicted critical charge, and now \n\nR=2x IQ-lOabc2lQi (8-5) \n\nHardness and Survivability Requirements 221 \n\nwhere R is the number of errOrs per bit day, a and b are deviCe surface dimensions in \nJLDl. c is the device depth in IJ.III, and C2c is the critical charge in pC. These two equa-\ntions have been shown to predict upset rates in .the geosynchronous orbit for solar \nminimum conditions with reasonable accuracy. Scale factors for estimating error rates \nfor other orbits and other calculational methods may be found in Petersen [1995]. \n\nSingle-event upset rates in complex devices such as microprocessors, or single-\nevent latchups or bumouts in any devices, cannot be reliably predicted. We must resort \nto predictions based on simulated accelerator test observations and flight performance \nof similar devices. \n\nGalactic cosmic rays can also generate background noise in various satellite \nsubsystems such as star sensors, infrared detectors, and components employing \ncbarge-coupled devices. In addition to increased noise signals, these rays create \nspurious events which can masquerade as real signals. The spurious signals can affect \nsatellite subsystems depending on the genuine signals' frequency of occurrence, time \nduration, and repetition, as well as the sophistication of the sensor system. Galactic \ncosmic rays are a potential source of background noise which must be taken into \naccount when designing a satellite system. It should also be noted that, while this sec-\ntion addresses effects of galactic cosmic rays, similar effects are caused by high energy \nprotons and must be considered for orbits in the range of 1,000-10,000 km altitude. \n\n8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements \n\nPaul Nordin, The Boeing Company \nMalcolm K. Kong, TRW Syslems & Information Technology Group \n\nSurvivizhility is the ability of a space system to perform its intended function after \nbeing exposed to a stressing natural environment or one created by an enemy or hostile \nagent. Hardness is an attribute defining the environmental stress level which a space \nsystem can survive. As an example, a satellite or spacecraft which can withstand an \nX-ray fluence of 1.0 calIcm2 or absorption of 107 rads (Si) of total dose (a rad of \nabsorbed dose is approximately 100 ergs/g) has a hardness of that amount. (Fluence is \nthe time integral of flux. Flux is the flow of energy per unit time and per unit cross-\nsectional area.) \n\nIn the aerospace industry we now consider both natural and hostile environments \nin the definition of hardness and survivability. Well-developed technologies, evolved \nover the last 35 years, make it possible to design satellites to withstand natural and \nmodest levels of hostile environments. Although technologies for hardening against \nhostile military threats and for natural survival of satellites overlap, they are distinct \nand are usually treated separately except in the areas of surviVability to total dose due \nto the Van Allen belts, single-event effects (SEE) caused by galactic cosmic rays and \nhigh energy protons, and spacelbulk charging due to naturally occurring space plas-\nmas. The latter phenomena must be treated synergistically in the design of satellites. \n\nA military space system or commercial satellite must be survivable if we will need \nits services in times of high stress, such as a nuclear war. To do this, we must under-\nstand what may cause the system to malfunction and then design it to protect against \nfailures. Survivability requirements include identifying the environments and their \nintensities and, in most cases, designing the space system so it will continue to perform \nits intended function for a specified time after exposure. \n\n\n\n222 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.2 \n\nCommercial or scientific satellites usually do not need to be survivable to military \nthreats, but planners must be aware that an unhardened satellite may prematurely stop \noperating after even very distant nuclear explosions. A slight hardening of satellites \ncan make them much more survivable. (See Sec. 8.2.3.) The Starfish high-altitude \nnuclear test of July 9, 1962, illustrates the vulnerability of unhardened satellites. That \ntest, a 1.4 megaton device at 400 km altitude above Johnston Island in the Pacific \nOcean, caused the failure of several satellites when electrons became trapped in the \nEarth's geomagnetic field. As a result of those failures, the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff \nestablished hardening guidelines for all military satellites, including opemtional and \nexperimental ones. Ritter [1979] discusses these guidelines. \n\nStudies were conducted by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (formerly the \nDefense Special Weapons Agency) [Webb, et al., 1995] on the possible effects of a \nsmaIl Third World nuclear burst (for example, 50 kT at 120 km altitude over the East \nAsian Peninsula) on known commercial (unhardened) satellites. Satellites considered \nincluded Hubble Space Telescope, Iridium, ORBCOMM, Globalstar, NOAA, and \nNimbus. These satellites showed lifetime reductions of 67% to as large as 99%. \n\nIt is important to consider survivability from the outset of mission design. For \nexample, if the satellite can function within a range of orbit altitudes, the highest of \nthese is both the hardest to attack and the most expensive to reach. We should consider \nthe system's survival in each of its life-cycle phases, including concept definition, \nengineering design and development, and operations in orbit Note, however, that \nhistorically we have not hardened launch systems because of cost and weight, as well \nas undefined need. The main military threats against space systems are nuclear \nweapons, including directed energy designs such as X-my lasers; ground- and space-\nbased laser weapons; high-velocity-pellet (fragmentation) weapons; high-power \nmdio frequency (microwave) weapons; homing kinetic energy weapons; and beam \nweapons using neutral atomic particles. We may use several approaches to make a \nsystem survivable, with hardening of the satellite as a key element. Section 8.2.4 \ndescribes these possible approaches and discusses their approximate cost and relative \neffectiveness. \n\n8.2.1 The Nuclear Weapons Environment and Its Effect on Space Systems \n\nNuclear weapons pose the most severe threat to spacecraft or space systems. The \nyield, or explosive power, and accuracy of delivery are such that if a nuclear weapon \ndirectly attacks a spacecraft, ground station, or any other node of a space system, the \nnode will be destroyed. Nuclear weapon yields can range from a few tons to many \nmegatons of TNT equivalent (one kiloton of TNT is dermed to be 1012 calories). Future \nnuclear exchanges could use yields of a few hundred kilotons to a few megatons, \ndepending on the purpose of the specific attack and the weapon's delivery accuracy. \nAccurate delivery of low yields will achieve the desired kill probability, whereas less \naccurate delivery requires higher yields. . \n\nApproximately 80% of the energy from a nuclear weapon detonated in space \nappears in the form of X-mys. Other important effects include smaIl amounts of \ngamma mys and neutrons, as well as smaIl fractions in residual mdioactivity and \nkinetic energy of bomb debris. For additional technical detail on nuclear weapons \neffects, see Glasstone and Dolan [1977]. \n\nX-Radiation. The X-radiation occurs because just after detonation, nuclear bomb \nmaterial is at 10-100 million K. As a first approximation, the hot bomb material will \n\n8.2 Hardness and Survivability ReqnJrements \n\nvery quickly radiate the energy as though it were a black body, according to the Stejtm-\nBoltzmann's law: \n\nE =aT4 (8-6) \n\nwhere E is the energy in W 1m2, T is the absolute temperature in K, and Gis the Stefan.-\nBoltzmann's constant (5.67 x 10-8 W\u00b7 nr2 \u2022 K-4). At higher black-body temperatmes, \nmore X-my photons are emitted at higher energies. (This is Wien's law, which states \nthat Amax T = constant, where Amax is the wavelength at maximum intensity and Tis \nthe absolute temperature of the blackbody.) \n\nThe X-ray fluence, Fx' at a distance R from a nuclear detonation of yield Y is given \nby \n\nFx=/x Y/(41tR2) \n\n=6.4YIR2 \n\n. (8-7a) \n\n(8-8a) \n\nwhere Ix is the fraction of the energy emitted as X-rays (= 0.8) and in the numerical \nform Fx is in ca1/cm2, Y is in kilotons, and R is in km. \n\nNeutron Radiation. One kiloton of equivalent nuclear' energy arises from the \nfission of approxiinately 1.45 x 1023 nuclei. Each fission produces 2 or 3 neutrons. \nApproximately half of these neutrons escape during the few tens of nanoseconds of \nenergy generation. Accordingly, the neutron fluence at a distance R em from a nucleax \ndetonation is given by \n\nFn = 0.5 x 2.5 x 1.45 x I023Y/(47tR2) \n(8-9) \n\nwhere Y is in kilotons, R is in kID, and Fn is in n/em2\u2022 This equation is onlyapproxi-\nmate. The actual neutron output will depend upon the design of the nuclear weapon. \n\nPrompt Radiation. Gamma radiation emitted during the actual nuclear bum time \nis prompt radiation, whereas gamma rays emitted after the nuclear bum time are \ndelayed radiation. Prompt gammas result from fission reactions, neutron capture, and \ninelastic neutron scattering events occurring during intense generation of nuclear \nenergy. The total energy and energy distribution of the prompt gamma mys depend on \nthe nuclear weapon's specific design. To calculate preliminary survivability at range \nR from a nuclear burst in space, we can express the dose, Dr, (energy deposited per \nunit mass) in silicon semiconductor material from prompt gamma radiation as \n\nDr =4 x 105y213IRlmds(Si) (8-10) \n\nwhere R is in km, Y is in megatons, and Dr is in mds (Si). \nDelayed Radiation. Delayed gammas, neutrons, positrons, and electrons-or \n\nresidual mdiation-occur when radioactive fission products decay. For about the first \nsecond after a nuclear explosion, the decay rate from residual nuclear radiation is \nnearly constant Thereafter, the dose mte follows the approximate law: \n\nR = Ro(t/tO)-l.2 (8-11) \nwhere R is the dose mte (usually in mdsIhr) at any elapsed time after the reference \ntime, ~o' when the dose mte was Ro. The fission products causing this dose mte contain \nmore than 300 different isotopes of 36 elements from the periodic table, so the inverse \n1.2 power of time is an approximation. It is accurate to within 25% for the first \n6 months after the nuclear explosion [Glasstone and Dolan, 1977]. \n\n\n\n224 The Space Environment and Survivability \n\nThe explosion energy rapidly disperses residual radiation. In the absence of an \natmosphere and geomagnetic fields, the radioactive fission products would expand \ngeometrically and decrease in intensity by the inverse square of the distance from the \nburst. However, the geomagnetic field causes the mostly ionized, radioactive weapon \ndebris to spiral along geomagnetic field lines, in a manner similar to the charged-\nparticle motion descnDed in Sec. 8.1. Thus expansion of the radioactive debris will \ndepend on the magnetic field at the nuclear event and on the magnetic field's config-\nuration between the nuclear event and\u00b7 the satellite being considered. As a first \napproximation, we can assume a geometric expansion. A more conservative approach, \nhowever, would be to assume that the nuclear event and the satellite are on the same \ngeomagnetic field lines. The largest possible amount of radioactive debris would then \nfunnel from the nuclear event to the satellite. \n\nAn upper bound estimate of the delayed gamma flux due to radioactive debris, in \ngammas or photons per square centimeter per second, from a single nuclear burst, is \ngiven by \n\nr = 9x101S y I 41tR2 (1 + t)l.2 photons I cm2 / s (8-12) \nwhere Y is yield in megatons (one-third of total yield assumed to be fission), R is \ndistance from the burst point in kilometers, and t is time after burst in seconds [Gold-\nflam, 1990]. This estimate applies to cases where the debris strikes and plates outer \nsurfaces of a satellite, as well as cases where the debris is far away. Similarly, an esti-\nmate of delayed beta debris can be made by applying a one-third factor to the equation. \n\nBoth delayed gammas and betas will manifest themselves as noise spikes in electro-\noptical and visible sensor elements used on satellite systems (such as infrared \nsurveillance sensors, optical/visible sensors, Earth sensors, and star trackers). The \ndelayed gammas are a significant threat to satellites, since they can be reduced only by \nvery thick shielding with high Z materials. \n\nElectromagnetic Pulse (EMP). EMP is a secondary effect of nuclear weapon \ndetonations. X-rays and gamma rays impinging upon the upper atmosphere create an \nelectron flux which radiates in the RF region of the spectrum. EMP's spectral energy \nis mostly in the 1 MHz to 100 MHz range. As the RF energy arrives at a satellite, it \nwill induce currents and voltages that may damage or kill the satellite if we do not \ndesign to protect it Nominal electric field strengths, which satellites would experi-\nence, can vary from 3 to 100 Vim, depending on satellite altitude and burst location, \nrelative geometry, and other parameters. \n\nSystem-Generated EMP, SGEMP, is a phenomenon caused when X-rays and \ngamma rays hit a satellite or other system element, thereby creating an internal flux of \nelectrons whose electromagnetic interactions create large currents and voltages. These \nlarge internal currents and voltages can damage sensitive components inside the satel-\nlite. Section 8.2.3 discusses how we can mitigate these effects. \n\nGeomagnetkally Trapped Radiation. Following a nuclear burst at high altitude, \nelectrons caused by the weapon join the naturally occurring Van Allen radiation belts \n(Sec. 8.1). The electron flux may increase by many orders of magnitude, thus increas-\ning the absorbed dose in unshielded materials as the satellite repeatedly traverses the \nVan Allen belts. To protect solid-state (silicon) electronic circuits, we normally \nenclose them in aluminum, with wall thickness ranging from 0.0254 em (0.01 inch) to \na centimeter or more. Aluminum shielding with a thickness of 0.1 cm and a density of \n2.71 g/cm3 corresponds to 0.27 g/cm2\u2022 Figure 8-9 of Sec. 8.1 gives the natural dose \nrate in silicon, in rads per year, for polar orbits as a function of orbital altitude and for \n\nHardness and Survivability Requirements 225 \n\nseveral values of aluminum shielding. The dose scales linearly with time so the curves \ncan be used for longer or shorter durations. A polar orbit satellite will accumulate less \ndose than an equatorial one because the trapped radiation is essentially nonexistent at \nand near the geomagnetic poles of the Earth; this dose difference can be as large as a \nfactorof5. \n\nOneYearTo1aI Dose-30 cIeg inclinations \n\nI- _100mDsAi ./' \n\n~ \n_200mDsAi \n\n_300mDsAi \n\n.f~ \\ \n\nIi' \n\n10' 100 1,000 10,000 100,000 \nAltItude (Ion) \n\nA.

The dose for shorter periods can be estimated by linear scaling; \nhowever, longer periods cannot be estimated by linear scaling since the saturated \nenvironment deCays rapidly. As with the natural trapped electrons, the nuclear \n\n\n\n226 The Splli:e Environment and Survivability 8.2 \n\nweapon-enhanced electron flux is practically nonexistent near the north and south \npoles. For satellites with higher inclination orbits, i.e., greater than 60 to 70 deg, the \naccumulated dose is greatly reduced, compared to satellites with inclinations of zero \nto 60 or 70 deg. \n\nAn example will show how these calculations work in practice. Consider a satellite \nwhich must operate for 1 year in the natural environment and then operate (survive) \nfor 1 day following a high altitude nuclear explosion which creates an electron-\nenhanced Van Allen belt. We assume a circular orbit, 30 deg inclination and an \naltitude of 6,000 km. For a wall thickness of 0.254 em (corresponding to a shielding \nvalue of 0.69 g/cm2), Fig. 8-15A gives a dose of about 130 krads in 1 year. Figure \n8-15B gives a dose of 21 Mrads for 30 days and 700 krads for 1 day. Adding the two, \nwe get 830 krads. The electronics must be able to function properly after accumulating \na total dose of this amount. Solid-state electronics can be hardened to tolerate from a \nfew krads to about 1 Mrad so our satellite, if hardened to 830 krads or more, would \nsatisfy the survivability requirement of 1 year natural plus 1 day weapon enhanced. \n\nNuclear Weapon Effects on Materials. The X-radiation pulse lasts tens of nano-\nseconds, and its energy is absorbed almost instantaneously in solid material through \nthe photoelectric effect and Compton scattering. In the photoelectric effect, bound \nelectrons of the material are ejected from their atomic orbits and take on a kinetic \nenergy equal to the difference between the energy of the incident photon and the \natom's ionization energy. The incident photon disappears in the photoelectric effect, \nwith its absorption per atom proportional to the 5th power ofZ, the atomic number of \nthe absorbing material, and inversely proportional to the 7/3 power of the incident \nphoton's energy [Heitler, 1954]. Therefore, high-Z materials shield against X-rays \nmore effectively, and the absorption cross section decreases dramatically for incident-\nphoton energy from 1 to 20 keY (1 keY = 1.6 x 10-16 )). \n\nCompton scattering is an elastic scattering event in which an electron -receives \nsome of the energy of the incident photon, and the incident photon changes direction. \nAs a result, the photon's energy decreases and its wavelength increases [Heitler, \n1954]. The cross section per atom for Compton scattering is proportional to Z and, for \nthe range of photon energies we are interested in, is inversely proportional to the inci-\ndent photon's energy. Therefore, for Compton scattering, increasing Z only slightly \nincreases the absorption coefficient, whereas the cross section decreases moderately \nas the photon energy increases. \n\nThe energetic, free electrons described above can cause electronic circuits to \nmalfunction, and their energy ultimately appears as heat in the material. In fact, the \nmaterial heats rapidly enough to create shock waves which develop tensile stresses \nthat may cause spall at its unconstrained boundaries. H the deposited energy is high \nenough (usually not the case at typical satellite fluence levels), the material may \nvaporize or melt, creating direct damage in addition to the shock waves. For space-\ncraft, where flux or fluence levels are low, malfunction of electronic circuits is the \nmost likely occurrence. \n\nGamma rays resulting from nuclear explosions range from a few hundred keY to \nseveral MeV. In preliminary designs, we can assume that gamma rays have a mean \nenergy of approximately 1 MeV and interact with matter primarily through Compton \nscattering. Because gamma radiation is very penetrating, we cannot effectively shield \nagainst it. Thus, when we wish to protect against the less penetrating, but more highly \nionizing, X-radiation, we need only provide enough shielding to reduce the prompt \ndose to levels approximately equal to that of gamma radiation. FigUre 8-18 of \n\nHardness and Survivability Requirements 227 \n\nSec. 8.2.3 gives the prompt dose induced by a unit fluence of X-radiation as a function \nof additional shielding (the abscissa of the figure can be converted to linear dimensions \nby dividing by the density of the shielding material). For higher or lower fluences, \nlinear scaling is appropriate. \n\nNeutrons interact with material by colliding with atomic nuclei. The collisions \nimpart energy to the atoms of the material and displace the atoms from their normal \npositions in the lattice. Changing the lattice structure can seriously harm solid-state \nelectronic devices because they depend on the characteristics of the lattice for their \nfunction. At fluences greater than about 1012 nlcm2, neutrons can cause solid-state \ndevices to stop working, thus \"electronically killing\" a satellite. \n\nEffects on Communications. A nuclear weapon detonated in space near the Earth \ninteracts strongly with the atmosphere and the Earth's magnetic field. The electromag-\nnetic energy radiated from the detonation creates large-scale ionization in the bomb \nmaterial and in the atmosphere. Radioactive debris contributes beta particles \n(positrons and electrons) from radioactive decay. The ionized bomb debris and beta \nparticles move along the lines of force of the geomagnetic field, as described in \nSec. 8.1. As the magnetic field lines enter the atmosphere, the energetic particles \ninteract with it, creating more ions and electrons. The free electrons thus created \nabsorb and reradiate RF energy and refract the electromagnetic waves of the radio \ncommunications links between ground and satellite, creating phase and amplitude \nchanges. These in turn reduce the signal strength in radio receivers, thus interrupting \ncommunications. \n\nBased on the theory of electromagnetic propagation, the attenuation, a, in dB per \nkID, is given by \n\na = 4.4 x I()4Ne vi \u00ab21r/'P + VZ) dBlkm (8-13) \nwhere Ne is the number of electrons per em3, v is the frequency of collision of electrons \nwith ions, atoms or molecules in Hz, and f is the frequency of the electromagnetic \nradiation in Hz. The values of these parameters are difficult, if not impossible, to \nobtain. However, the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency (formerly the Defense \nSpecial Weapons Agency) can provide computer programs for propagation analyses \nin nuclear environments, assuming appropriate clearances and need to know can be \nestablished. \n\nFor space-to-ground links, we can use the form of Eq. (8-13) and the fact that the \ndensity distribution of the atmosphere is approximately exponential to infer the \nabsorptive behavior of RF signals as a function of frequency. The form of Eq. (8-13) \nindicates that the absorption passes through a maximum as a function of collision \nfrequency, v, which is proportional to the density of air. Above approximately 80 km, \nthe density is so low that v is essentially zero and absorption does not occur. Below \nabout 60 km, electrons rapidly reattach to atoms and molecules, so the low electron \ndensity again leads to small absorption. Therefore, the attenuation is at a maximum for \nany given radiation frequency between 60 and 80 km. In this region the attenuation \nvaries with the inverse square of the radiation frequency. Thus, we should choose the \nhighest communication frequency we can to minimize attenuation due to nuclear \nweapons environments. For a more complete treatment of nuclear effects on commu-\nnications, see Mohanty [1991]. \n\nHigh data-rate requirements for military satellites with surveillance sensor payloads \nand future commercial communications satellites have resulted in the use of opticall \nlaser links in modern systems. While having many advantages over RF links, such as \n\n\n\n228 The Space Environment and Survivability \n\nweight and power, opticalJink components are also affected by nuclear environments. \nTable 8-6 contains general guidelines for the effects of nuclear radiation on optical1inIc \ncomponents. \n\nTABLE 11-6.

High-power lasers are being developed as potential ground-based \nor space-based antisatellite weapons. The flux in power per cross-sectional area from \nthese weapons is given by \n\n(8-14) \n\n8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements \n\nwhere P is the average output power, D is the laser objective diameter, Q is the qna1ity \nof the laser beam (dimensionless), A. is the wavelength of the laser, J is the angular \njitter of the beam (in rad), and R is the range from the laser to the target. Q = 1 indicates \na diffraction-limited weapon; laser weapons being developed will have a beam quality \nof 1.5 to 3.0. Both pulsed and continuous-wave lasers are in development. Equation \n(8-14) is for a continuous-wave laser, but is approximately correct for the average flux \nfrom a pulsed laser. The peak flux for a pulsed laser will be much higher. \n\nFor engagement ranges of several hundred km, the laser spot sizes will be several \nmeters in diameter and will, in general, completely engulf the target satellite in laser \nradiation. To damage or kill a satellite at any range, the laser beam must hold steady \nlong enough to achieve a damaging or killing level. Depending on the incident flux \nlevel and sensitivity, this dwell time could be several seconds or minutes. \n\nFragmentation or Pellet Weapons. The fonner Soviet Union operated an \nantisatellite weapon using fragmentation pellets that could attack satellites in low-\nEarth orbit [U.S. Congress, OTA, 1985]. This weapon, launched from ground \nlocations, achieved an orbit with nearly the same elements as those of the target satel-\nlite. Hence we call it a co-orbital antisatellite system. Radar or optical guidance brings \nthe weapon close to the target satellite. A high explosive then creates many small \nfragments which move rapidly toward the target satellite and damage or kill it by \nimpact \n\nHigh-Power Microwave Weapons. These weapons generate a beam ofRF energy \nintense enough to damage or interfere with a satellite's electronic systems. Their fre-\nquencies of operations range from 1 to 90 GHz, thereby covering the commonly used \nfrequencies for command, communication, telemetry, and control of most modem \nsatellites. A satellite's antenna tuned to receive a frequency the weapons radiate will \namplify the received radiation. Thus, it could damage RF amplifiers, downconverters, \nor other devices in the front end of a receiver. \n\nNeutral-Particle-Beam Weapons. Particle accelerators have been used for high-\nenergy nuclear physics research since the early 1930s, so the technology is well \ndeveloped. Weapons using this technology must be based in space because the \nparticles cannot penetrate the atmosphere. The particles would be accelerated as neg-\native hy4rogen or deuterium ions, then neutralized by stripping an electron as they \nemerge from the accelerator. (The particles must be electrically neutral to avoid being \ndeflected by the Earth's magnetic field). \n\n8.2.3 Spacecraft HardenIng \n\nHardening of a space system's elements is the single most effective action we can \ntake to make it inore survivable. Presently, we use hardening to prevent electronics \nupset or damage from nuclear-weapon effects. In the 2000s, we will see laser harden-\ning in military satellites which must survive hostile attacks. If projected antisatellite \nweapons are developed and deployed, hardening will help reduce the effects of High-\nPower Microwave and Neutral-Particle-Beam weapons on satellites. \n\nFigure 8-16 gives approximate upper and lower bounds on the weight required to \nharden a satellite to nuclear weapons effects. The technology for hardening satellites \nagainst nuclear weapons is well developed up to a few tenths of cal/cm2. Above these \nlevels, the hardening weight increases sharply, as Fig. 8-16 illustrates. Figure 8-17 \ngives rough upper and lower bounds on hardening costs. Comparable cost data may be \nfound in Webb and Kweder [1998]. \n\n\n\n230 The Space Environment and SurvivabDity \n\n6 \n\no \n10-5 10-4 \n\n11111 III\"\"\" \n~I~~r~ \n\n/ \n\n~ Lower Bound \n\n111111111 I \n10-3 10-2 10-1 \n\nHardness Level (callcm2) \n\n10 \n\nRg. 8-16. Weight Required to Harden a SateDIte as Percent of SateDIte Weight. \n\nFor X-rays with photon energy below 3 keV, shielding is very effective with almost \nany convenient material, such as aluminum. At higher photon energies, materials with \nhigher atomic numbers, Z, are more effective than the low-Z materials. A commonly \nused shielding material is tantalum because of its aVailability and ease of manufacture. \nA satellite's external surfaces are particularly vulnerable to crazing, cracking, delam-\nination, or micro-melting. Therefore, we must carefully select materials for these \nsurfaces to protect functions such as thermal control, optical transmission, or reflec-\ntion. In this category are covers for solar cells, optical coatings on lenses and thermal \ncontrol mirrors, thermal control paints, metal platings, and optical elements made of \nquartz or glass. The data for typical satellite materials exposed in underground nuclear \ntests is, in general, classified. \n\n8 \n\no \n10-8 \n\nI--\n\n10-4 \n\nilll II \"\"\" I~p~rl~~ \nI--'\" \n\nl-\n\nLower un \n\n10-3 10-2 10-1 10 \n\nHardness Level (callcm2) \n\nRg. 8-17. Cost to Harden a SateIDte as a Percent of Total SateIDte Cost. Costs Include \nproduction cost plus proportional share of engineering costs. \n\nPrompt dose results from penetrating X-radiation and, to a lesset'-extent, from \nprompt gamma. Typically, the X-ray prompt dose is 3 to 4 orders of magnitude larger \nthan the dose from prompt gamma. At typical spacecraft levels, prompt dose can break \nthe bonds of the leads on susceptible integrated circuits and caD cause electronic \ncircuits to experience burnout, latchup, and temporary upset. \n\nHardness and Survivability Requirements 231 \n\nIn most cases, shielding of the X-radiation can reduce the internal dose to manage-\nable levels. Figure 8-18 gives the prompt dose in silicon shielded by the basic \nO.04O-inch aluminum enclosure plus a range of additional tantalum shielding in g1emz. \nWe can use this figure to estimate the extra tantalum weight required to shield against \nthe prompt dose. The procedure is as follows: \n\n101~--L---~--~--~ __ ~ __ -L __ ~ \no 0.5 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 \n\nThIckness (g/cm2) \n\nFig. 8-18. Prompt Dose as a Function of Additional Tantalum Shielding (Worst Case \n1-15 keY Spectrum). \n\n\u2022 Using Fig. 8-18, scale the maximum allowable prompt dose by the fluence \nappropriate to the system under consideration and determine the surface mass \ndensity (gIcm2) required; \n\n\u2022 Multiply the surface mass density required by the total area to be shielded on \nthe satellite. \n\nThe total dose is the sum of the ionizing dose from all sources of radiation and is \nusually expressed in rads (Si). In almost all cases, the total dose is dominated by \ntrapped electrons in the geomagnetic field. Figure 8-19 giveS the dose in silicon as a \nfunction of thickness of shielding material in g1cm2, normalized to an incident 1 MeV \nelectron fluence of 1014 electronslcm2\u2022 The asymptotic nature of the dose curve for \nlarge mass densities results from the bremsstrahlung electrons produce as they stop in \nthe shielding material. Thus, we would shield interactively for total dose and prompt \ndose. The prompt dose shielding also attenuates the radiation from the Van Allen belts, \nand the extra aluminum needed to attenuate the VanAllen belt radiation also\u00b7 \nattenuates the prompt X-radiation. For example, as Fig. 8-18 shows, an aluminum box \n0.102 em thick can reduce an external prompt dose of 3 x lOS rads (Si)' cal-I. em2 to \nan internal dose of 4 x lOS rads (Si)' caJ.-I. em2\u2022 We can reduce the prompt dose even \nfurther by adding more high-Z material, such as tantalum or tungsten as shown in \nFig. 8-18. This high-Z material also reduces the dose caused by trapped electrons, as \nmentioned above. \n\nMetals are relatively unaffected by total dose. However, total dose degrades certain \nproperties of organic materials, beginning between 0.1 and 1 Mrad, and makes them \nunusable above 10 to 30 Mrad. For example, organic materials may\u00b7 soften, become \nbrittle, or lose tensile strength. NASA [1980J and Bolt and Carroll [1963J give data on \nhow the total dose affects organic materials. Figure 8-20 shows the \"sure-safe\" total \ndose capabilities for commonly used satellite materials. \n\n\n\n232 The Space Environment and Survivability \n\n1()3 L..-_....I...._--' __ ...L..-_---'-__ -'--_-..l \n\no 0.5 1.5 2 2.5 3 \nShield Materlal- g/cm2 \n\nRg.8-19.

Total Dose Capabilities of Satellite Materials. \n\nFused Glass .. ~ \nCaJbon \n+--+ \n\nBakelIte \n\nSilicon electronic devices suffer decreases in operating parameters such as gain, \ngate voltage, or lifetime of the minority carrier. We can measure these operating \nparameter changes as a function of dose and develop curves of radiation deratings. \nThus, during circuit design. these radiation deratings are used to ensure that the \ndevices will continue to operate satisfactorily at the design exposure level. \n\nTotal dose also includes the ionization from prompt and delayed weapon radiation, \nas well as neutron-generated radiation. To the total dose from man-made sources of \nhostile radiation, we must add radiation from the natural environments. The total dose \ndepends on the amount of shielding, orbital parameters, and satellite life. In the \nabsence of nuclear-weapon detonations, the total dose will normally increase linearly \nwith time on orbit. To harden a satellite against these effects, we would use silicon-\nbased electronic devices which tolerate the effects and shield them to the appropriate \nlevel, depending on how long we want the satellite to last. In the future, we will \nincrease the use of electronic devices based on gallium arsenide, because gallium \narsenide appears to be unusually immune to total dose effects. \n\n8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements 233 \n\nRadiation hardened parts are required for all designs that must operate in nuclear \nweapon environments, but some commercial communications satellites can consider \nusing radiation tolerant parts (<50 krads capability) or even commercial off the shelf \n(COTS) Class B type parts (1~15 krads capability), particularly if they will only \noperate in low-Earth orbits (less than about 1,000 km) and have orbital design \nlifetimes of 2 to 3 years maximum. Table 8-7 shows a comparison of typical unhard-\nened COTS parts and hardened parts capabilities. \n\nTABLE 8-7. COTS and Rad Hard Parts Comparison.

Imple-\nmentation of the RHACP will help ensure the success of the hardness design and \nhardness verification process. The hardware is normally hardness qualified at an \nappropriate level, either piece part, unit, subsystem or system, whichever is economi-\ncally and technically correct. \n\nDisplacement fluence is any electromagnetic or particulate radiation which dis-\nplaces atoms from their normal lattice positions. For nuclear weapons, neutron fluence \nis the primary cause of displacement. In the natural environment, electrons and protons \nare the principal contributors. The displaced atoms and their vacancies will react with \nthe bulk material and form stable defects in the lattice structure. These defects \nsignificantly chaJige the equilibrium-carrier concentration and minority-carrier life-\ntime. In silicon solar cells, these changes degrade power output. In other solid-state \nelectronic devices, they reduce gain and increase forward voltage drop and reverse \nleakage currents. \n\nWe cannot harden to the neutron displacement fluence from a nuclear burst by \nshielding because the uncharged neutron is very penetrating and large amounts of \nshielding would be needed. In general, we harden to the neutron fluence by selecting \ndevices that resist degradation by neutrons. \n\nTo protect against displacement by electrons or protons, we must shield the solid-\nstate devices. Solar cells are shielded by a layer of fused silica, varying in thickness \nwith the amount of shielding required. At very high ionization dose, the cover glass \nmaterial darkens, reducing the solar array's power output. For solid-state devices \n\n\n\n234 The Space Environment and Survivability 8.2 \n\ncontained inside aluminum boxes, we choose the thickness of the aluminum to stop the \nelectrons and ignore the protons, which penetrate much less in most commonly used \norbits. \n\nDelayed beta radiation flux can also be shielded effectively in the same manner as \ntotal dose, since it is composed of electrons. In contrast, delayed gamma flux cannot \nbe shielded easily due to its high energy content (up to about 12 MeV). As an example, \na factor of 10 reduction requires about 1.1 inches (2.8 cm) of high Z material like tung-\nsten or tantalum. Mitigation of gainma debris noise spikes in sensor systems will \nrequire heavy shielding and/or pulse suppression signal processing (such as time delay \nintegration), or even complementary satellite tasking. Even then, the gamma noise can \nstill be high enough to cause sensor outages lasting from seconds to minutes, depend-\ning on specific sensor performance characteristics and design. For example, a fairly \nrobust sensor with an operational capability (noise threshold plus signal to noise ratio) \nof 1()9 photonslcm2 /s will be \"blind\" for about 34 sec, given a 1 megaton burst at \n100 km away from the satellite, using Eq. (8-12). \n\nEMP is typically in the MHz range. At satellite altitudes, EMP intensities of a few \nV 1m can easily cause damage and upset in unhardened satellites. To prevent this, Fara-\nday shields can keep the radiation from entering the satellite cavities. We can also use \ngood external grounding, interconnect all conducting parts and surfaces, employ surge \narrestors, and eliminate sensitive components. In addition, designing for electromag-\nnetic compatibility, such as shielding of cables and harnesses, will reduce or eliminate \nmuch of the potential for EMP damage. Computers are particularly sensitive to EMP, \nas are the following components (in order of decreasing sensitivity): semiconductor \ndiodes in microwave applications, field-effect transistors, RF transistors, silicon-\ncontrolled rectifiers, audio transistors and semiconductor diodes in power rectifier \napplications. \n\nSGEMP occurs when the incident flux of photons, both X-ray and gamma ray, \ncreates a flux of electrons inside the satellite. Some of the energetic electrons are not \nstopped in solid material but emerge into satellite cavities, causing currents and fields \nwithin these cavities. At representative satellite fluence levels, these electrons can gen-\nerate cable injection currents of 10-100 amperes/meter of cable length and peak cavity \nelectric fields of several hundred kilovolts/meter. The fields then couple electroinag-\nnetic energy into cables and other conductive elements in the cavity, and the sharp \npulse of energy transmitted to sensitive components can make them fail. \n\nSGEMP hardening uses the same methods as EMP hardening except for external \nshielding, because SGEMP generates inside the satellite. We can also treat internal \nsurfaces with low-Z (atomic number) paints to reduce electron emission into cavities. \nUsing specially designed low-response cables will also reduce SGEMP effects. \nFinally, we can protect input/output circuits and terminals with various devices-\nzener diodes, low-pass filters, and bandpass filters-to limit current or to clamp \nvoltage. \n\nThe natural space phenomena causing single event upsets (SEUs) and other single-\nevent effects (SEEs), as well as methods for predicting upset rates, were addressed in \nSec. S.1.5. Because shielding is ineffective in reducing SEEs, satellite systems must \nbe designed to mitigate these effects, given that they will occur. Table 8-S lists some \nclassical approaches used in modem space system design. The extent to which these \napproaches are applied depends on the mission criticality, system upset specifications \n(allowable rates and outage times), and orbital environment expected. However, as \nindicated in the table, selection of acceptable parts is perhaps the single most important \n\nr \n8.2 Hardness and Survivability Requirements 235 \n\nof all approaches for SEE mitigation, albeit not sufficient by itself. Not indicated in \nTable 8-8 is the effect of orbital altitude. While geosynchronous altitude is the worst \ncase for SEES (due to galactic cosmic rays), orbits that traverse the proton belt (ellip-\ntical orbits and those between about 1,200 km and 8,000 km altitude) will have SEEs \nfrom high energy protons, in addition to galactic cosmic rays, and the proton SEUs can \nbe 10 times worse. \n\nTABLE 8-8.

Satellites that are highly exposed to electrons (those at high altitudes, \ngeosynchronous and highly elliptical orbits) mnst also be designed to survive bulk \ncharging, in which electrons embedded in bulk dielectri~ (~ble dielectric~ an~ circuit \nboards) and isolated conductors (such as ungrounded ctrcwt board metallizations and \nspot shields on parts) build up potentials sufficient to cause ~scharges. ~uch dis-\ncharges can result in anomalous upset and/or damage to electromcs, much like SEUs, \ndiscussed in the preceding paragraph. \n\nMuch of the work on bulk charging is summarized by Vampola [1996], based on \nCRRES flight data. Mitigation approaches are indicated in Table 8-9. Designers can \neliminate most bulk charging concerns simply by providing sufficient shielding to \nreduce both maximum current on circuit boards to less than 0.1 x 10-12 ampslem2 and \nmaximum total integrated fluence to less than 3 x 1()9 electronslcm2 on un~u~ \nlocaIized spot shields [Frederickson et al., 1992]. For geosynchronous satellites, this \nshielding is about 0305 em of total equivalent aluminum (which is typically provided \nfor total dose protection). \n\n\n\nThe Space Environment and Survivability 8.2 \n\nTABLE 8-9.

Table 8-11 presents other strategies for enhancing \nsurvivability. We use redundant nodes, also called proliferation or multiple satellites, \nto overlap satellite coverages. Thus, if one satellite fails, others will perform at least a \npart of the total mission. An attacker must use multiple attacks to defeat the space sys-\ntem--a costly and therefore more difficult approach for the enemy. The development \nof the so-called lightsat technology-light, inexpensive satellites performing limited \nfunctions-will support this strategy. To be effective, each node (ground station or \nsatellite) must be separated from another node by a large enough distance to prevent a \nsingle attack from killing more than one node. \n\nTABLE 8-10.

Therefore, satellites needed to be auton-\nomous or capable of being controlled by multiple mobile ground control stations, or \nutilize a combination of the two survivability features. In the Post-Cold War era, these \nsurvivability features are less importanL Nevertheless, the following principles of \nsurvivability are still relevanL Mobile ground stations are survivable because ICBMs \ncannot find targets whose Earth coordinates are unknown and continually changing. \nBy deploying mobile ground stations so they are separate from one another, we allow \na single nuclear weapon to kill, at most, one ground station. \n\nTABLE 8-11.

Without such information, ground \noperators may assume a spacecraft fault or natural accident has occurred, rather than \nan attack. Thus, controllers could act incorrectly or fail to act when necessary. More \nimportantly, national command authorities need timely information telling of any \nattack on our space assets. \n\nDecoys are an inexpensive way to blunt an antisatellite attack. They simulate the \nsatellite's optical or RF signature and deploy at the appropriate moment, thus diverting \nthe attack toward the decoys. Decoys must be credible (provide a believable radar or \noptical simulation of the satellite) and must properly sense an attack to know the \nprecise moment for the most effective deployment We can also defeat a homing anti-\nsatellite by including optical or RF jammers to nullify or confuse its homing system. \nSuch jammers weigh little and, depending on how well we know the parameters of the \nhoming system, can be very effective. \n\nA satellite can maneuver, or dodge, an antisatellite attack if it has thrusters for that \npurpose. Of course, almost every satellite has thrusters for attitude control and orbit \nchanges. Thrusters for maneuvers are more powerful, generating higher accelerations \nand causing the need for stiffer, stronger solar arrays or other appendages. These extra \nrequirements lead to weight penalties. In addition, we must supply more propellant, \ntrading off the increased propellant weight against the increased survivability. \n\nA satellite can defend itself against an antisatellite attack if that capability is \nincluded in the design. One possible approach is to include a suite of optical or radar \nsensors and smaIl, lightweight missiles. The sensors would detect the onset of an \nattack, determine approximate location and velocity of the attacker, and launch the \nself-guided, homing missiles to kill the attacker. Of course, we would have to consider \nweight, power, inertial properties, and other design factors, but a self-defense system \nis a reasonable way to help a high-value spacecraft survive. Alternatively, we could \ndeploy an escort satellite carrying many more missiles and being much more able to \ndetect, track, and intercept the antisatellite attack. An escort satellite would cost more \nthan active defense on the primary satellite, but the latter's weight and space limita-\ntions may demand it \n\nReferences \nBilitza, D., D.M. Sawyer, and J.H.

I, the payload is the combination of hardware \nand software on the spacecraft that interacts with the subject (the portion of the outside \nworld that the spacecraft is looking at or interacting with) to accomplish the mission \nobjectives. Payloads are typically unique to each mission and are the fundamental \nreason that the spacecraft is flown. The purpose of the rest of the spacecraft is to keep \nthe payload healthy, happy, and pointed in the right direction. From a mission perspec-\ntive it is worth keeping in mind that fulfilling these demands is what largely drives the \nmission size, cost, and risk. Consequently, a critical part of mission analysis and \ndesign is to understand what drives a particular set of space payloads so that these \nelements can become part of the overall system trade process designed to meet mission \nobjectives at minimum cost and risk. \n\nThis chapter summarizes the overall process of payload design and sizing, with an \nemphasis on the background and process for designing observation payloads such as \nFtreSat. (Communications payloads are discussed in Chap. 13.) We begin with the \nflow of mission requirements (from Chap. I) to payload requirements and the mission \noperations concept (from Chap. 2) to a payload operations concept which defines how \n\n241 \n\n\n\n242 Space Payload Design and Sizing \n\nthe specific set of space instruments (and possibly ground equipment or processing) \nwill be used to meet the end goals. We then summarize key characteristics of electro-\nmagnetic radiation, particularly those which define the performance and limitations of \nspace instruments. Finally, we provide additional details on the design of observation \npayloads and develop a preliminary payload design for FrreSat,. which we compare \nwith the MODIS instrument, a real FrreSat payload for the Terra spacecraft in NASA \nEarth Observing System. \n\nSeveral authors have discussed space observation payload design in detail, such as \nChen [1985], Elachi [1987], and Hovanessian [1988]. More recently Cruise, et aI. \n[1998] provides a discussion of a full range of payload design issues including optics, \nelectronics, thermal, structures and mechanisms, and program management In \naddition, a number of authors provide extended discussions of specific types of obser-\nvations missions. Schnapf [1985], Buiten and CIevers [1993], and Kramer [1996] \nprovide surveys of Earth observing missions and sensors. Huffman [1992] discusses \nUV sensing of the atmosphere. Meneghini and Kozu [1990] and Kidder and Vonder \nHaar [1995] discuss meteorology from space. Kondo [1990] and Davies [1997] \ndiscuss astronomical observatories in space. Finally, Chap. 13 provides numerous \nreferences on space communications payloads and systems. \n\nSpacecraft missions have been flown to serve many purposes, and while virtually \nevery mission has unique elements and fulfills some special requirement, it is none-\ntheless possible to classify most space missions and payloads into the following broad \ncategories: communications, remote sensing, navigation, weapons, in situ science, and \nother. Table 9-1 provides a sample of missions that fall within these categories along \nwith a primary payload and spacecraft that fits that particular mission. Many other \ntypes of space missions have been proposed or demonstrated. We include these in \nTable 9-1. We will introduce each of these spacecraft mission types, then focus on \nfirst-order system engineering analysis of remote sensing payloads. \n\nCommunications. The purpose of the majority of spacecraft is to simply transfer \ninformation. Communications missions range from wideband full-duplex telecommu-\nnications connectivity to one-way broadcast of television signals or navigation \nmessages. Communications has traditionally been dominated by large geosynchro-\nnous spacecraft, but constellations of smaller spacecraft in lower orbits are emerging \nwith alternative architectures for global coverage. New technologies are developing \nrapidly, including research into using lasers for spacecraft communication. A detailed \ndiscussion of communications payloads and subsystems is included in Sec. 11.2, \nChap. 13, and Morgan and Gordon [1989]. \n\nRemote Sensing. Spacecraft remote sensing represents a diverse range of missions \nand applications. Any observation that a spacecraft makes without directly contacting \nthe object in question is considered remote sensing. Imaging the Earth's surface, \nsounding the Earth's atmosphere, providing early warning of a ballistic missile launch, \nor observing the characteristic chemical spectra of distant galaxies are all remote sens-\ning missions. Fundamentally we focus on measurements in the electromagnetic spec-\ntrum to determine the nature, state, or features of some physical object or phenomenon. \n\nDepending on the particular mission, we can evaluate different aspects of elec-\ntromagnetic radiation to exploit different characteristics of the target with respect to \nspatial, spectral, and intensity information content We also evaluate this information \nin a temporal context that supports comparisons and cause-and-effect relationships. \nThe types of information and sensors used to provide this information are illustrated \nin Fig. 9-1. \n\nT \n243 \n\nTABLE 9-1.

As discussed in Sec. 11.7.2, GPS provides information for real-time position, \nvelocity, and time determination. It is available worldwide on a broad range of plat-\nforms, inchiding cars, ships, commercial. and military aircraft, and spacecraft. The \nheart of GPS is a spread-spectrum broadcast communication message that can be \nexploited using relatively low-cost receivers.. . ... . \n\nWeapons.

Development of certain \noperational space weapons has been prohibited under the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \nof 1972. Although some experts view widespread weaponization of space as \ninevitable, it has not become a stated objective ofU .S. national policy [DeBlois, 1997]. \nOf course, space has been used to support military objectives since the dawn of artifi-\ncial spacecraft [Hall, 1995; McDougall, 1985], but the vast majority of military space \napplications fall into the categories of remote sensing and communications. \n\nIn Situ Science. Sample collection and evaluation serves an important role in \nplanetary and space science. Perhaps the most elaborate instance of sample collection \ntook place in the Apollo missions when approximately 300 kg of samples from the \nMoon were returned to Earth for analysis. Other examples of sample collection and \nanalysis include planetary landers (such as Viking and Mars Sojourner) and collection \nof solar wind particles. \n\nOther. Exploitation of physical resources in space-either from the Moon or \nasteroids-bas sparked innovative and imaginative concepts for augmenting Earth's \nlimited resources or enabling human exploration of the solar system. In the nearer \nterm, however, space-based materials processing and manufacturing are more likely \nto mature and exploit the characteristics of the microgravity environment (Sec. 8.1.6). \nGlaser et al. [19931 has done extensive studies of satellite solar power, i.e., generating \nsolar power in space for use on Earth. Many authors have created designs for lunar \ncolonies and space tourism facilities, but all require a dramatic reduction in launch \ncost. (See, for example, the CSTS Alliance's Commercial Space Transportation Study \n[1994].) \n\nT \nI Payload Design and Sizing Process 245 \n\n9.1 Payload Design and Sizing Process \n\nPayload definition and sizing determines many of the capabilities aDd limitations \nof the mission. The payload determines what the mission can achieve, while the size \nof the payload, along with any special structural, thermal, control, communications, or \npointing restrictions, will influence the design of the remainder of the spacecraft \nsupport systems. \n\nWe begin with the assumption that mission objectives are defined and the critical \nmission requirements are understood. This section concentrates on a top-down meth-\nodology for bounding the trade space of possible payloads and making an informed \nselection among them. This process is a useful guide for moving from a blank slate to \na preliminary set of payloads. Iterating on the process produces a more detailed \ndefmition and more useful set of payloads that can meet the mission objectives at \nminimum cost and risk. \n\nAs shown in Table 9-2, the process begins with an understanding of mission \nrequirements described in Chaps. 3 and 4. The mission requirements have a major \neffect on all aspects of space vehicle design, but it is frequently necessary to treat the \ncomponents and subsystems separately for preliminary design and sizing. We begin \nwith the payload because it is the critical mission element bounding spacecraft perfor-\nmance. Chapters 10 and 11 treat the remainder of the spacecraft systems and trade-offs \ninvolved in the overall spacecraft design. \n\nOnce the mission requirements are understood, we must determine the level of \ndetail required to satisfy different aspects of the mission. For FireSat, varying levels of \ndetail are required if the task is to identify the existence of a fire, assess the damage \ncaused by frres, or characterize the combustibles in a fire. Additionally, the temporal \n(timeliness) demands placed on the mission could be vastly different depending on \nwhether the data is to support long-term scientific analysis or real-time ground activity. \n\nWe summarize the basic steps in this process below and discuss them in more detail \nin the remainder of this chapter for remote sensing payloads and in Chap. 13 for com-\nmunications payloads. \n\n1. Select Payload Objectives. These objectives will, of course, be strongly related \nto the mission objectives defined in Chap. 1 and will also depend on the overall mis-\nsion concept, requirements, and constraints from Chaps. 2, 3, and 4. However, unlike \nthe mission objectives which are a broad statement of what the mission must do to be \nuseful, the payload objectives are more specific statements of what the payload must \ndo (i.e., what is its output or fundamental function). For FrreSat, this is specific perfor-\nmance objectives in terms of identifying fires. For the space manufacturing example \nin the table, called WaferSat, the payload objective is a definition of the end product \nto be manufactured. \n\n2. Conduct Subject Trades. The subject is what the payload interacts with or looks \nat As discussed in detail in Sec. 9.2, a key part of the subject trade is determining what \nthe subject is or should be. For a mobile communications system, it is the user's hand-\nheld receiver. Here the subject trade is to determine how much capability to put in the \nuser unit and how much to put on the satellite. For FrreSat, we may get very different \nresults if we define the subject as the IR radiation produced by the fire or as the smoke \nor visible flickering which the fire produces. In addition to defining the subject, we \nneed to determine the performance thresholds to which the system must operate. For \nFrreSat, what temperature differences must we detect? For WaferSat, how pure must \nthe resulting material be? For mobile communications, how much rain attenuation \n\n\n\nSpace Payload Design and Sizing 9.1 \n\nTABLE 9-2.

These will be iterative trades as we begin to define \nthe payload instruments and can intelligently evaluate cost Vs. performance. \n\n3. Develop the Payload Operations Concept. Ultimately, the data or product \nproduced by the payload must get to the user in an appropriate form or format. How \nwill the end user of FrreSat data receive and act on the satellite data? How will the \n\nT 9.l Payload Design and Sizing Process 247 \nmanufacturer recover the WaferSat materials and define what is to be done on the next \nflight? Payload operations will have a major impact on the cost of both the spacecraft \nand mission operations. As discussed in Chap. 15, payload operations may be done by \nthe same facility and personnel that handle the spacecraft or, similar to the Space \nTelescope, may be an entirely different operations activity. \n\n4. Determine the Required Payload Capability. What is the throughput and \nperformance required of the payload equipment to meet the performance thresholds \ndefined in Step 2? For FrreSat what is the specification on the equipment needed to \nmeet the temperature, resolution, or geolocation requirements? For WaferSat, how \nmany wafers of what size will it produce? For mobile communications, now many \nphone calls or television channels must it handle simultaneously? \n\n5. Identify Canditkde Payloads. Here we identify the possible payloads and their \nspecifications. For simple missions there will be a single payload instrument. For most \nmissions, there will be multiple instruments or units which frequently must work \niogether to meet mission requirements. Different complements of equipment may \nbreak the tasks down in different ways and may even work with different aspects of \nthe subject. Thus, a system designed to identify the source of solar storms may have \nan imager and a spectrometer or a magnetometer and an instrument to map small \ntemperature fluctuations on the photosphere or in the solar wind. \n\n6. Estimqte CandUloJe Payload ChoracteristU:s. Here we need to determine the \nperformance characteristics, the cost, and the impact on the spacecraft bus and ground \nsystem so that we can understand the cost vs. performance for each of the viable \ncandidate systems. Payloads will differ in their performance and cost, but also in \nweight, power, pointing, data rate, thermal, structural support, orbit, commanding, and \nprocessing requirements. We must know all of these impacts to conduct meaningful \nttades. \n\n7. Evaluate CandUloJes and Select a Baseline. Here we examine the alternatives \nand make a preliminary selection of the payload combination that will best meet our \ncost and performance objectives. In selecting a baseline, we must decide which \nelements of performance are worth how much money. The payload baseline is strongly \nrelated to the mission baseline and can not be defined in isolation of the rest of the parts \nof the mission and what it will be able do for the end user. \n\n8. Assess life-cyele Cost and Operability. Ultimately, we want to determine \nmission utility as a function of cost. This process was described in detail in Chap. 3. \nTypically it will not be a simple cost vs. level of performance characterization. Rather \nit is a complex trade that requires substantial interaction with potential users and with \nwhatever organization is funding the activity. It may become necessary at this point to \nrelax or prioritize some of the mission requirements in order to meet cost and schedule \nobjectives. For FrreSat we may decide that only one type of fire or one geographic \nregion will be addressed. For WaferSat we may reduce the purity, the size of the \nwafers, or the throughput. \n\n9. Define Payloa4-derived Requirements. In this step we provide a detailed \ndefinition of the impact of the selected payloads on the requirements for the rest of the \nsystem (i.e .. the spacecraft bus, the ground segment, and mission operations). FrreSat \nwill have power, pointing, geolocation, and data rate requirements. WaferSat may care \nvery little about pointing and geolocation, but will have requirements .on the spacecraft \ncleanliness levels and jitter control. These, in turn, may levy secondary requirements \nsuch as storage for onboard commands or thermal stability for pointing and jitter \ncontrol. \n\n\n\n248 Space Payload Design and Sizing 9.1 \n\n10. Document and Iterate. Although this point is emphasized throughout the \nbook, we stress again the need to document what we have decided and why. The \n\"why\" is critical to allowing the system trades to proceed at a future time. We can \nmake preliminary decisions for a wide variety of reasons, but we must understand \nthese reasons in order to intelligently continue to do payload and system trades. Like \nall of the space mission analysis and design process, payload definition is iterative. We \nwill come back to the process many times as we learn more about the consequences of \npreliminary choices. \n\nFigure 9-2 illustrates the conceptual process of payload sizing. At the bottom end \nof the curve, we need to spend a minimum amount of money to achieve any perfor-\nmance at all. Near minimum performance, a sma1l amount of additional expense will \nsubstantially increase performance. At the top end of the curve, we can spend a lot of \nmoney for very smaIl improvement. The overall payload performance per unit cost \nfollows a straight line through the origin and whatever point on the performance vs. \ncost curve we are working at Therefore, the maximum perfonnance per unit cost \noccurs where a straight line through the origin is tangent to the curve. \n\n~ \nBestPerfonnance \nper Unit Cost \n\n\"\"-.. Lowest Cost Solutions \n\nCost \n\nPerfonnance \nSolutions \n\nFig. 9-2. Performance vs. Cost. The tangent point is the highest perfonnance per unit cost \n\nThere are good reasons for operating at any region along the curve in Fig. 9-2. To \ndesign a good payload, we must decide where along the curve our particular mission \nshould be. At the high end w~ obtain the best available performance. This would be \nappropriate for some military or science missions, such as the Space Telescope or \nChandra X-Ray Observatory. UghtSats are at the bottom end of the curve. They \nperform modestly at very low cost. They may also be appropriate for multi-satellite, \ndistributed systems. Large commercial activities, such as communications satellites, \nneed the best perfonnance per unit cost \n\nThe key to deciding how to size our payload is to look carefully at the mission \nobjectives, particularly the tacit rules which often imply how well we want to do. Do \nwe need the best performance regardless of cost? Can the mission proceed only on a \nminimum budget? Is this a long-tenn, continuing, and potentially competitive activity \nin which performance per unit cost is critical? The answers to these questions will let \nus correctly size the payload and the mission to meet our mission objectives. \n\nMission Requirements and Subject Trades 249 \n\n9.2 Mission Requirements and Subject Trades \n\nDefining requirements and constraints for,space missions occurs as descn'bed in \nChaps. 1 and 2. The overall mission requirements dictate the technical performance of \nthe payload, while the mission concepts and constraints detemJine the operational \nimplementation for the mission. Frequently the technical specification and operations \nconcept for payloads are interrelated. For example, increasing temporal resolution \n(revisit) may reduce the requirement for spatial resolution in an optical sensor system. \nWe must ensure that the mission requirements capture the fundamental needs of the \nusers without constraining the designer's ability to satisfy these requirements through \nalternate technical means. \n\nFor FrreSat we begin with the overall mission requirement to detect, identify, and \nlocate forest fires, then consider the level ~f detail needed to satisfy the mission. Often \nit is useful to articulate the questions that need to be answered or the decisions that \nneed to be made based on sensor data. Possible questions for the FrreSat mission plan-\nners include: \n\n\u2022 Can a new fire be detected within 2 hours? Twenty minutes? \n\n\u2022 What is the geographic extent of the fire? \n\n\u2022 Can smoldering fires be distinguished from flaming fires? \n\n\u2022 What are the primary combustibles (can fires burning organic material be \ndistinguished from petroleum and chemical fires)? \n\n\u2022 What direction is the fire spreading and how quickly? \n\n\u2022 How much smoke and ash is the fire generating? \n\n\u2022 Where is the fire burning hottest? \n\n\u2022 At which locations would additional firefighting efforts to contain and \nsuppress the fire be most effective? \n\n\u2022 What other sources of information exist from air-, ground-, or space-based \nsources? \n\n\u2022 If available, how might other sources of information be used? \n\nSpecific mission objectives and priorities addressed by these questions will deter-\nmine the specific observables linking payload performance with mission performance. \nTo choose a remote sensing payload, the key steps to a disciplined and repeatable \ndesign begin with determining the elements of information that we need to address the \nproblem. We must specify the physically observable quantities that contribute to . \nelements of information about the problem in sufficient detail to ensure they can be \ndetected by a spacecraft payload with sufficient resolution to provide meaningful \ninsight into the subject \n\nEstablishing performance thresholds provides a framework for trading off per-\nfonnance across a number of different design features. For all missions, payload \nperformance evaluation categories include physical performance constraints and oper-\national constraints. Examples of physical perfonnance constraints include limits on \nspatial, spectral, radiometric, and temporal resolution. Operational constraints include \nsensor duty cycle limits, tasking and scheduling limits on sensor time, and resource \ncontention (inability of the sensor to view two targets of interest simultaneously). \n\n\n\n2SO Space Payload Design and Sizing \n\nWithin each of the categories of sensor constraints, we should establish an absolute \nminimum threshold such that any performance that does not meet this capability is \nunacceptable. The minimum threshold values generally will not satisfy mission objec-\ntives, but establishing the minimum level of usefulness for the mission allows \nflexibility for trade-offs. At the other extreme, we should specify the desired perfor-\nmance to establish the performance that will fully satisfy the requirement We can also \ndefine an intermediate value-an acceptable level of performance-tQ articulate a \ndesired level of performance that will meet the bulk of mission objectives. Table 9-3 \nillustrates a sample of performance thresholds for the FJreSat mission payload across \nthe functional areas of resolution, quantity, timeliness, periodicity, geolocation \naccuracy, and completeness. These distinctions can be critical in determining the via-\nbility of a mission concept In commercial remote sensing, for example, the range of \nperformance requirements from minimum to desired is typically determined through \nextensive market analysis and business development case studies. These studies \nfrequently identify a minimum resolution (or other performance parameter) below \nwhich a remote sensing spacecraft concept will not be profitable. \n\nTABLE 9-3.

This \nparameterization involves a process of requirements analysis that focuses on matching \nthe tasks involved in the mission with categories of discipline capabilities. If we match \nmission requirements with existing or probable capabilities the result is a set of poten-\ntial information requirements. We then try to identify the characteristics of the subject \n(signatures) that correspond to the information requirements through a set of rules. For \nthe FireSat example, these rules consist of the spectral wavelengths and thresholds \nneeded to detect fires. The rules yield a set of mission observables, such as specific \nwavelength bands and spectral sensitivities that we need in our sensor. These \nobservables provide the basis for the payload characteristics that comprise the baseline \ndesign to satisfy the mission. In the case of FJreSat, the basic mission categories that \nmight satisfy this mission and the corresponding information type are shown in \nTable 94. \n\nMission Requirements and Subject Trades 251 \n\nTABLE 11-4. Slmplmed Subject Trades for F1reSat Mission. The information type aUows for \nsubject trades to be made among the different signatures that can be exploited to \nsatisfy FireSat mission requirements. \n\nSensor Type InformaUon Type \n\nErectTo-optJcallmager Visible retum from nght or smoke cloud produced by the fire \n\nSpeCtrometer Spectral signatures from products of combustion \n\nRadiometer Thermal intensity \n\nA unique signature exhibited by fires is the flickering light in a fire. This flicker has \na characteristic frequency of about 12 Hz and can be exploited by processing the data \nstream from an electro-optical sensor to search for this frequency [Miller and \nFriedman, 1996]. Light flickering at this frequency produces an irritating effect on the \nhuman vision system, possibly as a survival adaptation for the species against the \nthreat of wildfires. \n\nThere are many choices and types of sensors, more than one of which might be a \ncandidate to perform a given mission. In the case ofFJreSat, it may be possible to sat-\nisfy basic mission requirements by observing a number of different phenomenologies: \nvisible signatures associated with flame and smoke, thermal infrared signatures from \nthe fire, spectral analysis of the products of combustion, or an algorithm combining all \nof these. The selection of a spacecraft payload represents the fundamental leap in \ndetermining how to satisfy mission requirements with a space sensor. In the previous \nsection we introduced a top-down framework for considering the general problem of \nspacecraft design. Here we tum our attention to the payload; in particular, a method-\nology for determining the type of payload to employ and the physical quantities to \nmeasure. \n\nFigure 9-3 illustrates the framework for the heart of the payload design process. The \nprocess begins with a task or mission requirement and ends with a spacecraft payload \ndesign. We have divided this process into intermediate steps to focus the effort along \nthe way to a final design. In this section we focus on describing the process illustrated \nin Fig. 9-3; Sec. 9.4 provides some of the specific techniques that are employed in this \nprocess for visible and IR systems. \n\nFor the FrreSat mission design. we need to identify specific signatures that would \nallow candidate sensors to provide viable solutions to the mission requirement We \nobserve physical phenomena through signatures, and we must choose which signature \nwill provide the desired information. The specific signatures that a payload senses \nmust be evaluated in light of the particular focus of the mission. For example, a \nspectrometer that is sensitive enough to detect all fires, but which cannot be used to \ndifferentiate campfires from forest fIres could generate a large false alarm rate and \nrender it operationally useless. DefIning the key signatures and observables that \nsupport the information content needed to satisfy the mission determine the perfor-\nmance limits for the payload design. \n\n9.2.1 Subject Trades \n\nThe objective of a space mission is typically to detect, communicate, or interact \nThe subject, as an element of the space mission, is the specific thing that the spacecraft \nwill detect, communicate, or interact with. For OPS, the subject is the .OPS receiver, \nFor FJreSat, we would assume that the subject is the heat generated by the forest fire. \nBut other subjects are possible: light, smoke, or changes in atmospheric composition. \n\n\n\n252 \n\nI,\nfl,'\"\" \n\n\"\",_,:i!,I, \n\n;:;g: \n\n,~. \n;giL \n\nI \n\nSpace Payload Design and Sizing 9.2 \n\nAg. 9-3. Process for Unklng MIssIon RequIrements to Payload DesIgn. The process \nmoves from mission requirements to a payload design In three steps: requirements \nanalysis, subject trades, and payload analysis. \n\nWhat we choose as the subject will dramatically affect performance, cost, and the \nmission concept. Thus, we must do this tIade carefully and review it from time to time \nto ensure it is consistent with mission objectives and our goal of minimizing cost and \nrisk. \n\nTable 9-5 summarizes the subject-trade process. We begin by looking at the basic \nmission objectives and then ask what subjects coUld meet these objectives. To do this, \nwe should look at what we are trying to achieve, the properties of space we intend to \nexploit, and the characteristics of what we are looking at or interacting with. Table 9-6 \nshows examples of subject tIades for four representative missions. As the missions \nchange, the nature of the subject trades will also change. For FrreSat, we are looking \nfor a well-defined subject (the forest fire), and we want to do this at minimum cost and \nrisk. With the Space Telescope, we must ask. \"What am I looking for? What am I try-\ning to detect and how can I detect it?\" For any of the science missions, we would ask, \n'18 the subject some distant and unknown object, or is it part of the electromagnetic \nspectrum I am trying to explore?\" \n\nFor a space system intended to detect airplanes, the main subject trades would \nconcern mission goals. Are the targets cooperative or noncooperative? Do we need to \ntrack over the poles? Should we track in high-density areas around airports or over the \n. open oceans? The answers to these questions will determine the nature of the subject \ntrades. \n\nPerhaps the easiest subject tIades are-those in which the system will be interacting \nwith a ground element that is a part of the system, such as direct broadcast television \nor a truck communication system. In this case, the subject trade becomes simply an \nissue of how much capacity should go on the spacecraft vs. how much should go in the \nunit on the ground. \n\nMIssion Requirements and Subject Trades 253 \n\nTABLE 9-5. Subject Trade Process. Note that the subject trades lead directly to the payload \ntrade process as discussed In Sec. 9.2 \n\nWhere \nStep FJreSat Example DIscussed \n\n1.

Review selection frequently for See Sec. 22.3, NlA \nalternative methods and possible a1temative low cost for AreSat \nuse of ancillary subjects \n\nThe next step for subject trades is to determine whether the subject is controllable \nor passive. The system designer knows and can control characteristics of controllable \nor active subjects. This includes ground stations, antennas, receivers, and transmitters \nsuch as those used for ground communications, direct broadcast television, or data \nrelay systems. Because we can control the subject, we can put more or less capability \nwithin it. Thus we might choose to have a simple receiver on the ground with a bigh-\npower, accurately pointed. narrow-beam transmitter on the spacecraft. Or we could \nplace a sophisticated, sensitive receiver on the ground with a smaIl, lower-cost system \nin space. Usually. the solution will depend on the number of ground stations we wish \nto interact with. If there are many ground stations, as in direct-broadcast television, we \nwill put as much capability as possible into the satellite to drive down the cost and \ncomplexity of the ground stations. On the other hand, if there are only a few ground \nstations, we can save money by giving these stations substantial processing and point-\ning capability and using a simpler, lighter-weight, and lower-cost satellite . \n\nPassive subjects are those in which the characteristics may be known but cannot be \naltered. This includes phenomena such as weather, quasars, or forest fires. Even \nthough we cannot control the object under examination, we can choose the subject \nfrom various characteristics. We could detect forest fires by observing either the fire \nitself or the smoke in the visible or infrared spectrum. We could detect atmospheric \ncomposition changes or, in principle, reductions in vegetation. Thus, even for passive \nsubjects, the subject is part of the system tIades. \n\n\n\n254 Space Pa~load Design and Sizing \n\nTABLE 9-6. Representative Subject Trades.

Chapter 22 summarizes an alternative for sensing forest \nfires by using equipment on the ground and then relaying it to space-a technique \npossible for various mission types. Satellites that monitor the weather or environment \ncould do complex observations or simply collect and relay data from sensors on the \nground. \n\nThe next step is to determine whether we need multiple subjects (and. probably, \nmultiple payloads) to meet our mission objectives. Using multiple subjects at the same \ntime has several advantages. This approach can provide much more information than \nis available from a single subject and can eliminate ambiguities which occur when \nobserving only one aspect. On the other hand, multiple subjects typically require mul-\ntiple payloads, which dramatically drive up the space mission's cost and complexity. \nThus, a principal trade is between a low-cost mission with a single subject and single \npayload vs. a more expensive mission that achieves higher performance by using \nseveral payloads to sense several different subjects related to the same objective. \n\nFor FrreSat. we tentatively select the heat of the forest fire as the subject of the \nmission. keeping in mind that this may change as the design evolves. Of course, we \nshould make these trades as rapidly as possible because they strongly affect how the \nmission is done. \n\n9.3 Background 255 \n\nFmally, as always, we should document the subject selection and review it \nfrequently during the program's early stages. looking for other possible methods and \nsubjects. Looking for alternative subjects is perhaps the single most important way to \ndrive down the cost of space missions. We need to continually ask ourselves.

Finally, It ranges mto the radio \nspectrum, with wavelengths as long as kilometers. As the figure shows, satellite \nsystems operate over the entire spectral range. N~al wavelengths for .~msats, \nradars. and microwave radiometers range from approXImately 1 meter to 1 millimeter, \nwhereas visual and IR systems operate from around 0.35 to 100 microns (1 micron = \n10-6 m = 1 J.I.1D). . \n\nGamma-1 GRANAT DXB NImbus \nCQS.II ALEXIS QAO..

Thus, in terms of frequency, the usable electromagnetic \nspectrum ranges from radio waves measured in kilohertz (kHz) to gamma rays with \n\n\u2022 Both v and! are commonly used to represent frequency.

This is called thermal radiation or blackbody radiation. For a \nperfect blackbody, the rate of total energy emission and the energy distribution by \nwavelength or frequency is a function only of the temperature, T. The actual spectrum \nof emitted radiation from a real object will depend on the surface characteristics for \nsmall objects, such as a spacecraft, or on the atmosphere for large objects, such as the \nEarth or Sun. Nonetheless, in practice the blackbody energy distribution is a good \nstarting point for analysis. The spectral energy distribution of a blackbody is given by \nPlanck's Law: \n\n21thc2 1 \nEjl = ---;r- echlkTil -1 (9-2) \n\nwhere Ejl is the energy per unit wavelength (also called the spectral irradiance and \ntypically measured in Wom-2olJ.Ilrl),A is the wavelength, h is Planck's constant \n(6.6260755 x 10-34 Wos2), Tis the absolute temperature, c is the speed of light, and \nkis Boltzmann's constant (1.380 658 x 10-23 Wos/K). Figure 9-5 shows typical energy \ndistribution curves for various blackbody temperatures. When Ejl is divided by the \nsolid angle (in steradians) leaving an extended source in a given direction, it becomes \nLjl the spectral radiance (typical units, W-m-2.J.I.lIlI\"SJ'-I). \n\nF1go9-5. \n\nFrequency (Hz) \n\n1018 1014 1010 106 \n\nI \nj' \n\n1020 \nW1en's Iaw,Am V 10-4 ~ ..

Planck's law defines the shape of the curve over all frequencies, \nthe Stefan-Boltzmann's law defines the area under the curve (the total energy emitted \nover all wavelengths), and Wien's displacement law defines the wavelength of \nmaximum radiance. \n\n\u2022 A list of all metric prefixes is at the front of Appendix F. \n\n9.3 Background 2S7 \n\nFrom Planck's Law we can derive two other important relations. FJrSt, we obtain \nthe Stefan-Boltzmann's Law by integrating Eq. (9-2) over the complete spectrum, \nyielding the total radiant emittance, Wb: \n\nWb = O'T4 (9-3) \nwhere 0' is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, 5.67051 x lO-8 W~m-2.K-4, and Wb is \ntypically in W 1m2\u2022 Second, we derive Wien' s Displacement Law by differentiating \nEq. (9-2) and settiilg the result equal to zero. The straight-line result defines the locus \nof peak spectral radiance vs. temperature, as shown on Fig. 9-5 and defined by \n\n~ = 2,898 IT (9-4) \nwhere ~ is in ~ when T is in K. \n\nRemote-sensing instruments are aimed at a target on the Earth's surface or in space. \nRadars measure the characteristics of reflected, self-generated signals. For other \nsensors, an object's spectral radiance, or brightness, depends on itS equivalent black-\nbody temperature. This is the temperature of a perfect radiating body which has the \nsame total radiance. Visual systems, which use film or solid-state detectors to form the \nimages, can take advantage of the Sun's reflected energy, based on its blackbody \ntemperature of about 6,000 K. Of course, without sunlight, visual images are much less \ndistinct. On the other hand, systems using infrared and microwave radiometry measure \nscenes against the Earth's intrinsic thermal radiation background (corresponding to \nabout 300 K). Thus, they can operate day or night, as well as through clouds and other \natmospheric disturbances. Note, though, how much weaker the signals are in the RF \nbands compared to the IR ranges. \n\nAs Fig. 9-6 shows, the electromagnetic spectrum has many frequency bands for \nwhich the Earth's atmosphere is nearly opaque. We must avoid these bands if we wish \nto observe ground scenes. This phenomenon also allows us to sound the atmosphere \nand measure such interesting data as the thickness and location of cloud layers, water \nvapor contained in clouds, and other upper-atmospheric phenomena using the opaque \nbands. Clouds, rain, and snow tend to produce noise and thus attenuate signals for both \ncommunication and remote-sensing, even in the window bands. \n\nWhen a sensor views an aiea in space, the radiation that reaches the sensor could \ncome from a number of sources. The energy reflected directly from the target is \nusually the dominant feature of interest for optical remote sensing, but other emitted, \nreflected and scattered energy can complicate the picture. The primary (direct) and \nsecondary (single scatter) sources of electromagnetic radiation are shown in Fig. 9-7. \n\nThe sources of radiation in Fig. 9-7 give rise to a number of different strategies for \ndistinguishing different phenomena within the atmosphere or on the surface. For a given \napplication, any of the sources of radiation will either be the subject being analyzed or \nnoise to be minimized. Radiative measurements include the full complexity of all the \neffects on that radiation such as reflection, refraction, absorption, transmission, and \nscattering by material substances in solid, liquid, and gaseous phases. Distinguishing \nand identifying features using remote sensing techniques must take all of these vari-\nables into account As Miller and Friedman [1996] advise, \"when modeling the real \nworld, allow for some slack to represent reality.\" \n\n9.3.2 Basic.

The Manual of Remote \nSensing [Colwell, 1983] provides an extensive discussion, including image analysis. \nSeyrafi's [1985] treatment is also comprehensive, and ends with a design example of \na thermal imaging system for a spacecraft. \n\nIn this discussion, we treat reflective :;ystems (optical systems using mirrors) and \nrefractive :;ystems (optical lens systems) together and refer to them both as optical \n:;ystems. Reflective and refractive systems have advantages and disadvantages, which \nwe will discuss later. \n\nThere are several ways to describe an optical system. Parallel rays of light falling \non a perfect lens will all converge at the focal point, whose distance from the lens is \ncalled thefocallength,f. The foca1length largely determines the length of the optical \ncollection system and for a single lens, it is related to the lens surface's radius of \ncurvature. The foca1length of a spherical reflecting surface is one-half its radius. For \na parabolic reflector whose surface is defined by the equation z2 = 4.fY, the quantity f \nis the focal length; it equals the distance from the focus to the nearest point on the \nreflecting surface. \n\nIn design practice, we normally determine the required foca1length based on field \nof view and the size of the image plane.

The image size is a function of s and the size of the \ndetector-ranging from a single element to a large array~mployed at the focal plane. \nAs Fig. 9-8 shows, the foca1length needed to record an object or scene of radius R is \ngiven by \n\nL = rd = magnification \nh R (9-6) \n\nwhere h is the distance from the spacecraft to the object, rd is the radius of the detector \nmay in the image plane, and R is the radius of the object, with the image and object \nmeasured perpendicular to the line of sight The magnification or scale = rd IR is the \nratio of the image size to the object size. It is ordinarily a very small number for satel-\nlites. We express the scale on the image plane as \"\"I em equals x km on the ground.\" \n\nWe can also describe an optical element or system by its so-called infinity F-num-\nber or F-stop, often written as f !(read '\"F-stop\"), F, F No., or FtI.1t is defined asf !D. \nwhere D is the aperture or diameter of the lens.

Thus, the smallest F# is 05. \nAll optical systems suffer from aberrations, or imperfections in the image quality, \n\nin addition to diffraction which limits the system resolution as discussed in Sec. 9.3.3. \nThe principal optical aberrations are listed in Table 9-7. Chromatic aberration, or \nimperfections which are color or wavelength dependent, arises from various wave-\nlengths being bent by different amounts when they pass through a lens. Consequently, \nonly systems with at least one refractive element suffer chromatic aberration because \nreflective surfaces treat all wavelengths the same. (This is not absolutely true since \nsome surfaces will reflect visible light, for example, but not X-rays. However, when \nreflection does occur it is independent of wavelength to frrst order.) \n\nTABLE 9-7. Principal Aberrations In OpUcal Systems. See Table 9-8 for which of these are \nmitigated in various optical systems. \n\nChromatic Aberration = dispersion of the Dght due to the refractive index of a lens being a \nfunction of the wavelength. Causes different colors to focus at different distances. \n\nSpherical Aberration = dispersion In which Dght from the periphery of a spherical lens or \nmirror Is focused nearer the element than light from the center. Can be eliminated by making \nthe optical surface parabolic, rather than spherical. \n\nComa = dispersion of off-axis portions of the Image. (So named because In a telescope off-\naxis star Images look like tear drops or the coma of a comet pointing toward the center of the \nImage.) \n\nAstIgmatism = aberration in which the distorted image is asymmetric such as when light in \na horizontal plane comes to a slightly different focus than light in a vertical plane. A common \nproblem in human vision. \n\nDistortion = when an otherwise sharp image Is distorted in shape, such as when straight \nfines on the surface being viewed appear curved on the focal plane. A uncorrectable distortion \noccurs when trying to Image the celestial sphere onto a flat focal plane. (See Sec. 5.1.) \n\nCurvature of FIeld = when a sharp image Is formed on a focal surface which Isn't flal Can \nbe corrected In film systems by using a sOghtly curved focal plane. \n\nFigure 9-9 shows the three basic types of telescopes. In each of the three, there is a \ncorresponding refractive and reflective instrument The aberrations which can be cor-\nrected in each type are shown in Table 9-S. The lens doublet is the classic refractive \ntelescope lens. The doublet can be designed to eliminate spherical aberrations, coma, \ndistortion and chromatic aberrations (see Table 9-S).1n tele-optic lens systems the dis-\ntance between the optical element and the focal plane is shorter than the focal length. \nTele-optic lenses can eliminate spherical aberrations, coma, astigmatism, and curva-\nture of field effects. They can also overcome chromatic aberrations. The lens triplet is \nthe simplest refractive (spherical) optical systelll that theoretically allows for correc-\ntion of all distortions. The price we pay for this advantage is the very high sensitivity \nof each of the optical elements with respect to displacement or tilt.

The lens triplet compensates for all five of the third-order \naberrations: spherical aberrations, coma. astigmatism. curvature of field, and distor-\ntion. It too is free from chromatic aberrations. The same behaviors are present in the \ncorresponding reflective systems. The Schmidt Mirror System is an all-reflective \n\n9.3 Background \n\ndoublet, and the Cassegrain telescope is a reflective implementation of a tele-optic \nlens. The Three-Mirror Anastigmatic system is comparable to the lens triplet with \nrespect to all the aberration corrections, but with an all-reflective design. Reflective \noptical systems generally are free from chromatic aberrations. However, reflective \nsystems typically have a much smaller field of view than their refractive counterparts. \n\nIn reality, optical systems for space remote sensing are far more complex because \nthe technologies for manufacturing the lenses and mirrors are limited and other effects \nsuch as thermal distortions and radiation effects can alter the performance of the \ninstrument Thermal distortions can limit the performance of an optical system, even \nif the operating temperature range is regulated within a few degrees for high perfor-\nmance optical systems, and cosmic radiation effects can degrade the transparency of \nmost optical glass over time.

In general \nresolution is expressed in angular terms. Thus, a telescope that can just distinguish or \nresolve two stars which are very close together is said to have a resolving power equal \nto the angular separation of the stars. For Earth observing systems we are more inter-\nested in the ability to see or resolve tine detail on the surface. Thus, for these systems \nresolution is commonly expressed in terms of the size of an object On the Earth that \ncan just be distinguished from the background. To read this page requires a resolution \nof about 0.1 mm, whereas you may be able to distinguish a large newspaper headline \nwith a resolution of 1 cm. \n\nNo matter how good the quality of the lens or mirror, a fundamental limitation to \nresolution is diffraction, the bending of light that occurs at the edge of the optical sys-\ntem. Even for a perfect optical system, diffraction causes the image of a point source \noflight, such as a distant star, to a~ not as a point on the focal plane but as a series \nof concentric circles getting successively dimmer away from the center, as shown in \n\n\n\n264 Space Payload Design and Sizing 9.3 \n\nFig. 9-11. This pattern is called the diffraction disk, the Airy disk\u00b7, or the pOintspread \nfunction. The angular distance, 9\" from the maximum at the center of the image to the \nfirst dark interference ring, called the Rayleight limit, or Rayleigh diffraction criteria, \nis given by \n\n9, = 1.22AID (9-9) \nwhere A is the wavelength, D is the aperture diameter of the optical instrument, and 9, \nis expressed in radians. The bright maximum at the center of the Airy disk, out to the \nfirst interference minimum, contains 84% of the total energy which arrives at the focal \nplane from a point source. For a satellite at altitude, h, the linear resolution or ground \nresolution, X, at nadir is just \n\nX' = 2.44 hAID (9-10) \n\nwhere we have replaced the radius from Eq. (9-9) with the diameter of the resolution \nelement In this expression, h can be replaced by the slant range, Rs, from Eq. (5-28), \nto determine the resolution away from nadir (Rs here = D in Chap. 5). Note however, \nthat this is the resolution perpendicular to the line of sight and is made larger (i.e., \nworse) by I1sin E., where e is the elevation angle at the orbital point in question, \nobtained from Eq. (5-26a). The ground resolution at nadir for several typical wave-\nlengths and aperture diameters is given in Table 9-9. \n\nPoint Spread \nFunclion \n\nAperture \n\nGround \n/<iE=::.....,==:;-;-;::~\"'rl-k=-__ -.....-::-...::O::;rb:::ltc.:.:H::::elght.=~h ___ --l Resolution \n\n8ement, \nX' \n\nFig. 9-11.

The diameter of the aperture and the wavelength determine the \nextent of the point spread function measured by the diamater, d~ of the first intensity \nminimum. \n\nWhen we implement an optical system using a detector array, we add an additional \ndesign parameter, the quality factor, Q, defined as the ratio of the pixel size, d, to the \ndiameter of the diffraction disk or point spread function, d', i.e., \n\nQ =dld'=XIX' (9-11) \n\nwhere d' is the diameter of the first minimum in the diffraction image (i.e., twice the \nangular resolution), X is the ground pixel size, and X'is the ground resolution = diam-\neter on the ground corresponding to d' on the focal plane (see Fig. 9~ 12). Q typically \nranges from 0.5 to 2. For Q < I, the pixels are smaller than the diffraction disk and \nresolution is limited by diffraction in the optics.

In general, trans-\nformation processes that are more random produce wider bandwidth signatures, while \na more organized process produces a more coherent return [Elachi, 1987]. For \nexample, heat generated by a diesel motor is radiated over a wide bandwidth in the \ninfrared spectrum, while a laser (a more organized energy transformation) generates \nnarrow bandwidth radiation. In spacecraft remote sensing we are concerned with \nprocessing measurements from four primary spectral types. \n\nVisible systems operate from the ultraviolet (- 0.3 J1ID) to the red end of the visual \nspectrum (-0.75 J1ID). They offer the potential for high spatial resolution because of \ntheir short wavelengths, but can only operate in daylight because they depend on \nreflected sunlight. \n\nInfrared systems operate in various bands throughout the infrared spectrum \n(-1-100 J1ID) subject to atmospheric transmission windows. Infrared sensors can \noperate both day and night since the detected signal is a function of the emissivity of \nthe scene (although the signatures will be different by day and night). \n\nMicrowave radiometers operate in the radio frequency range, chiefly at the milli-\nmeter wavelengths (20-200 GHz). Their resolution is three to five orders of magnitude \nworse than visible wavelength sensors with the same aperture size, but they are \ncapable of collecting unique information over large areas. Typically, microwave \nsensor require extensive ground-truth calibration data to interpret the measurements. \n\nRtuJor systems are active instruments which provide their own illumination of the \nscene in the centimeter to millimeter bands. The reflected signals can be processed to \nidentify physical features in the scene. Radar systems can be designed to penetrate \nmost atmospheric disturbances, such as clouds, because only larger features can reflect \nsignals at radar wavelengths. Cantafio [1989] provides an extended discussion of \nspace-based radar. \n\nThere are a number of different approaches for linking the fundamental physics of \nthe Planck function to the practical design of remote sensing systems. Hovanessian \n[1988] treats emitted radiation as a signal to be detected and considers remote sensing \nessentially as a special case of antenna and propagation theory (even in the visible \nspectrum). Elachi [1987] begins with Maxwell's equations and focuses on the features \nof electromagnetic radiation, such as quantum properties, polarization, coherency, \ngroup and phase velocity, and Doppler shift to derive strategies for exploiting these \nfeatures in different parts of the frequency spectrum. McCluney [1994] draws on the \nparallels between the science of radiometry and remote sensing in general and the \nscience of the human eye as expressed in the literature of photometry. These references \nprovide detailed, application-specific derivations beginning with Planck's Law. Our \nfocus for the remainder of this chapter will be on engineering applications and rules-\nof-thumb to define and design remote sensing payloads. \n\nObservation geometry, effective aperture, integration time, detector sensitivity, \nspectral bandwidth, transmission through the atmosphere, and ground pixel size deter-\nmine the radiometric performance of an optical instrument. Depending on the spectral \nrange, we define three basic categories of Earth observation. In the first case, the \noptical instrument receives reflected radiation from the surface of the Earth when it is \nilluminated by the Sun. The thermal emitted radiation of the Earth's surface is negli-\ngible in this case. The frequency range covered by this case includes the visible wave-\n\n9.4 Observation Payload Design 267 \n\nlength (0.4-0.78 J.Ull), the near infrared wavelength (0.78-1 pm), and the short \nwavelength infrared (1-3 J1ID). \n\nThe second case involves optical instruments receiving emitted radiation from the \nsurface of the Earth when the reflected radiation of the sun is negligible. This condition \nholds for the long wavelength infrared region (8-14 J1ID). The third case applies to the \nmid-wavelength infrared spectral region (3-5 J1ID) where we must consider contribu-\ntions from direct and reflected sources. Figure 9-13 shows the radiance available from \ndirect and. reflected radiation sources. Corresponding to Planck's law, the thermal \nemitted radiance of the Earth (modeled at 290 K) increases with wavelength for the \nspectral region shown. The reflected radiance from the Earth's surface decreases with \nwavelength. \n\n107 \n\n.-\n1. co \n'i \nE \n\n<t \n\n! \n108 \n\n......

Radiance contribution In W per \nsquare meter per meter (wavelength) per unit solid angle of reflected sunOght from \nthe Earth and emitted radiation from the Earth as a function of wavelength. The sum \nIs shown as a dashed nne. The Sun Is modeled as a blackbody with a temperature of \n6,000 K, the reflection coefficient of the Earth's surface and the transmission of the \natmosphere are modeled as constants for clarity. \n\nIn the visual and near IR (0.7 to 1.0 J.lIll) bands, we resolve images produced by \nenergy (chiefly from the Sun) reflected from the target scene rather than energy from \nthe very limited self-emissions that occur in the visible band. But in the infrared. we \nsee things almost entirely by their self-emission, with very little energy being reflected,. \nparticularly atnight. We may use the same optical train elements-lenses, prisms, \nmirrors, and fllters-to collect infrared energy as for visible and UV, but we must \napply them differently. For example, ordinary glass is opaque to IR beyond 3 p.m, \nwhereas germanium, which is opaque in the visible band, is transparent in the 1.8 to \n25-J1ID region. Further, we must consider atmospheric scattering caused by aerosols \nand particles in the air. The amount of scattered radiation is a function of the inverse \nfourth power of the wavelength. Thus, IR penetrates haze and dust much better than \nvisible radiation because the IR wavelengths are four or more times those in the visible \n\n\n\n268 Space Payload Design and Sizing 9.4 \n\nspectrum. The same phenomena explain the reddish color of the sky near dawn and \nsunset. At these times, shorter green, blue indigo, and violet wavelength signals are \ngreatly attenuated as they travel farther through the atmosphere than when the Sun is \noverhead. \n\n9.4.1 Candidate Sensors and Payloads \nElectro-optical imaging instruments use mechanical or electrical means to scan the \n\nscene on the ground .. Spacecraft in geostationary orbits perceive very little relative \nmotion between the scene and the spacecraft, so an optical instrument needs to scan in \ntwo dimensions to form an image. A common approach for geostationary imaging \nspacecraft, such as ESA's meteorological spacecraft, METEOSAT, involves placing \na large scan mirror in front of the instrument's optics to perform the north-south scan. \nRotation of the spacecraft around a north-south axis performs the east-west scan. \nThree-axis stabilized spacecraft in geostationary orbits frequently use a two-axis scan \nmirror in front of the optics to scan the scene in two dimensions. Alternatively, we can \nuse a two-dimensional matrix imager, which maps each picture element (pixel) in the \nimager to a corresponding area on the ground. Scanning the scene then becomes a \nprocess of sampling the two-dimensional arrangement of pixels in the imager. \n\nSpacecraft in low-Earth orbits move with respect to the scene. The sub-spacecraft \npoint moves along the surface of the Earth at approximately 7,000 mls (see Chap. 5). \nThis motion can replace one of the scan dimensions, so the scanning system of the \noptical instrument needs to perform only a one-dimensional scan in the cross-track \ndirection. Whiskbroom sensors scan a single detector element that corresponds to a \nsingle pixel on the ground in the cross-track direction. Fig. 9-14A illustrates this tech-\nnique. Whiskbroom scanners can also use several detectors to reduce the requirements \ncompared to a single detector. Each detector element corresponds to a pixel on-ground \n(see Fig. 9-14B), and the dwell time per pixel is multiplied by the number of detector \nelements used. \n\nPush broom scanners use a linear arrangement of detector elements called a line \nimager covering the full swath width. The name \"push broom\" comes from the \nread-out process, which delivers one line after another, like a push>broom moving \nalong the ground track. Each detector element corresponds to a pixel on-ground. \nFig. 9-14C illustrates this technique. The ground pixel size and the velocity of the \nsub-spacecraft point define the integration time. \n\nStep-and-stare scanners use a matrix arrangement of detector elements (matrix \nimager) covering a part or the full image. Each detector element corresponds to a pixel \non-ground. Fig. 9-14D illustrates this technique. Step-and-stare systems can operate in \ntwo basic modes. The first mode uses integration times that are chosen as in the case \nof the push broom sensor for which the ground pixel size and the velocity of the sub-\nsatellite point determine the integration time. Thus, no advantage with respect to the \nintegration time is achieved, but a well known geometry within the image is guaran-\nteed. We need a shutter OF equivalent technique, such as a storage zone on the imager, \nto avoid image smear during read-out. The second mode allows a longer integration \ntime if the image motion is compensated to very low speeds relative to the ground. We \ncan do this by shifting the imaging matrix in the focal plane or by moving the line of \nsight of the instrument by other means to compensate for the movement of the sub-\nspacecraft point Step-and-stare sensors require relatively complex optics if they must \ncover the full image size. An additional complexity is that the fixed pattern noise has \nto be removed from the image, since each pixel has a somewhat different responsive-\n\n9.4 Observation Payload Design 269 \n\nA.

Table 9-10 summarizes the distinguishing features of optical \nscanning methods. \n\nAn alternate approach for capturing the scene using matrix imagers involves \npositioning of the scene with respect to the instrument. To image the entire scene, the \ninstrument shifts, or \"steps,\" to the next part of the scene (along-track and/or across-\ntrack) after the integration period. This approach is referred to as a step-and-stare \nimager. If it only covers a part of the required scene, then moderately complex (and \n~so moderately sized) optics is required. We can use highly agile and ~ point-\nmg mirrors in front of the instrument's optics to adjust the line of sight. For example, \nthe Early Bird satellite avoids the complexity of large matrix imagers or sophisticated \n\n\n\n270 Space Payload Design and Sizing \n\nTABLE 9-10.

Custom tailoring of these detectors and imagers is common, however, to \noptimize the design with respect to performance and cost of the instrument We make \nthe distinction between detectors, which consist of one or a few radiation-sensitive \nelements without read-out electronics, and imagers, which usually consist of a con-\nsiderable number of discrete radiation-sensitive elements combined with read-out \nelectronics. \n\nWe must select the materials used for detector elements depending on the spectral \nrange of the instrument being designed. The ability of detector elements to absorb pho-\ntons relates directly to the energy of the incident photons (and consequently to the \nwavelength of the radiation as well) and the effective band gap of the material. All \nmatter, including the detector material, generates thermal photons. Therefore, we must \nlower the temperature of the detector elements such that the self-generated photons do \nnot degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of the instrument. This requirement becomes \nmore stringent as the wavelength of the radiation being detected increases. With few \nexceptions, detectors and imagers have to be cooled for wavelengths in the short wave \ninfrared (SWIR) band and longer. \n\nFor the spectral range between 400 nm and 1,100 run, silicon detectors and imagers \nare used most frequently. Silicon is attractive because it is possible to combine the \ndetector elements and read-out electronics in a single monolithic chip. We can produce \nline imagers with a large number of elements through this process. \n\nIncident photons on a line imager are converted to an electrical output signal in the \nimager. For charge-coupled device (CCD) line imagers with read-out electronics, the \nprocess begins when incident photons are converted by each pixel (detector element) \n\n9.4 Observation Payload Design Z71 \n\ninto electrons according to a conversion efficiency dictated by the characteristic spec-\ntral response. The electrons are then collected for the entire integration time for each \npixel. The read-out of the charge generated-up to one million electrons per pixel-is \nperformed via an analog shift register into a Serial output port. Figure 9-15 shows a \ntypical spectral response function for a silicon imager. \n\n~ \n.!! \n1 \n~ \n~ \n~ \n1/1 c \n0 \nD-\n\n18 a: \n\n5.0 \n\n2.0 \n1.5 \n\n1.0 \n\n0.5 \n\n_ 1) = 1 ------ - 1) = 6.7 --- --- - 1) = 0.6 -- -- - ::;..--..... --~ - f- - - ~1)=0.5----.....-::: ---,.,.-\nI'\" \n\n0.25 \n\ni t ! \\ I \n0.2 \n0.15 \\ \n0.1 \\ \n\nI \\ \n400 500 600 700 800 900 1.000 1.100 \n\nWavelength (nm) \n\nFig. 9-15. Spectral Response FuncUon of a SUlcon Una Imager. The spectral response is \nshown In terms of the output voltage resulting from Illumination by energy density vs. \nthe wavelength from 400 to 1 ,100 nm. The imager reaches a quantum eff/cIency(gen-\nerated eiectrons per incident photon), deno1ed by 1/. above 50% between 4()(HI()() \nnm. Outside this wavelength region the quantum effiCiency drops to smaH values \nmaking the imager less suitable above 900 nm. \n\nArea array imagers, or matrix CCD imagers, provide an alternative to line imagers. \nThe principles of operation are essentially the same as line imagers. Area array imag-\ners offer the advantage of undistorted geometry within the image. A disadvantage \ncompared to line imagers is the possible smear effect during frame transfer. There are \na variety of read-out techniques to compensate for the smear effect. Matrix imagers \ncan also suffer from a relatively poor fill factor of pixels in the array. Table 9-11 \nsummarizes line and matrix imager capabilities for current systems that are at least \npartially space qualified. \n\nWhen radiometric performance of the optical instrument is paramount, we use time \ndelay and integration (TDI) methods. TOI describes an imaging principle that uses the \nimage motion along the rows of a matrix imager to extend. the integration time. \nIntegration time is extended by electronically shifting the integrating pixel cell syn-\nchronously to the movement along the row. The signal-to-noise ratio of this concept is \nimproved by the square root of the number of TOI stages. The primary advantage of \nTOI imager systems compared to line imagers is the improved signal-to-noise ratio. \nThe disadvantage is the increased requirement for spacecraft attitude and orbit stabil-\nity (due to the required synchronization of the shifting pixel). \n\nWe classify and select infrared detectors according to their spectral band of opera-\ntion and a figure of merit called specific detectivity or quantum efficiency for photon \ndetectors. The operating tempemture of the detector dictates the cooling requirements \n\n\n\n272 Space Payload Design and SJzing 9.4 \n\nTABLE 9-11\". Characteristics of Imagers.

Infrared sensors often have nonnegligible time constants for \nresponse with respect to integration time. Because of technical difficulties with com-\nbining detectors and read-out structure, the total number of pixels in an IR detector \narray is limited in practice to several hundred. \n\nWe detect infrared wavelengths with thermal detectors or photon detectors. Ther-\nmal detectors exploit the fact that absorbed heat raises the temperature of the detector, \nwhich changes its electrical characteristics. The advantage of thermal detectors is uni-\nform response with respect to wavelength. Thermal detectors can also be operated at \nambient temperatures, although they have lower sensitivity and slower response times. \n\nPhoton detectors use absorbed photons to generate charge carriers. These systems \noffer the advantages of higher sensitivity and shorter time response, but they must be \noperated at low temperatures. \n\nInfrared detectors are often rated by the specific detectivity, D*, given by \n\nD*= ~Alif (9-15) \nNEP \n\nwhere A is the detector area, lifis the noise equivalent bandwidth, and NEP is the noise \nequivalent power of the detector. The factor D* is strongly wavelength dependent \nshowing its peak value at the cut-off frequency. Figure 9-16 shows the specific detec-\ntivities and the operating temperatures for infrared detectors, and Table 9-12 gives \ncharacteristics of infrared detector arrays with read-out electronics. \n\nThe selection of a detector or detector array (usually with a read-out multiplexer) is \ndriven by several factors. The primary design issues center on maximizing detectivity \nin the spectraI band of interest while operating at the highest possible temperature and \na sufficiently small time constant In addition, we must consider the geometry \"of the \ndetector and the array as well as associated calibration issues. \n\n9.4.2 Payload Operations Concept \n\nIn addition to the technical trade-offs in spacecraft performance, the operations \nconcept for employing the sensor is an important consideration early in the prelimi-\nnary design. We need to understand the end-to-end mission problem-not merely the \nphysics of collection. The entire process beginning with the ultimate users or customers \nof the data needs to provide a feasible and efficient means to meet mission objectives. \n\n9.4 Observation Payload Design 273 \n\n1012 \n\nf 1011 \n! \n! \n] 1010 \n\nJ \nb \n\n109 \n\nloB c:(a)\"-'--'-.l.....L..-'-LLw.J..L...-.L.......I-'-.L.......I \n1.0 1.52.02.53458789101520253040 \n\nWavelength (pm) \n\n1012 \n\n. \n~ 1011 \n\n\\ . \n:I! \n! \nl1010 \n\nJ \nb \n\n109 \n\nloB c:~:!...1 .J........JL....J...l-.J........I......L..J...J...J.J..L.......I--L.....L.JL.......I \n1.D 1.5 2.02.5 3 4 5878910 15 20 2530 40 \n\nWavelength (pm) \n\nFIg. 9-16. specmc DetectlvlUes and Operating Temperatures for Infrared Detectors. \n(Courtesy of Santa Barbara Research Center.)

Not only can physical effects such as atmospheric correction, \ncalibration, and rectification degrade system performance, but technical effects such \nas quantization and data comPression errors can decrease the resolution of the system \nfrom the perspective of the end user. For additional information about technical \naspects of the end-to-end throughput problem for spacecraft imagery, see Shott \n[1997]. \n\nThe concept of operations for a spacecraft system such as Frre8at needs to account \nfor the full breadth of the operational mission, including different phases of the \nmission and alternate operating modes. See Sec. 2.1 and Chap. 14 for a description of \na mission operations concept \n\nFor preliminary mission planning, we should pay particular attention to the pr0-\njected sequence of events during each mission phase (see Activity Planning in \nChap. 14). For the FtreSat mission under normal operations, a sample mission timeline \nfor normal operations includes the following steps: . \n\nI. FIre starts at some location \n\n2.

Generate appropriate messages indicating the presence of fire \n\n7. Issue reports and notifications to appropriate authorities and research centers \n\n8. Monitor the fire (this could involve switching to an alternate operating concept \nthat tracks the progress of the existing fire and monitors surrounding areas for \nnew outbreaks) \n\nWe should create a concept of operations for each phase of the mission and each \noperating mode of the spacecraft~including contingency and failure modes. This step \nwill ensure mission success within the constraints of the operating environment (See \nChap. 14.) \n\n9.4.3 Required Payload Capability \n\nFrequently there are several ways to meet mission requirements. How to sort \nthrough these multiple approaches is not always obvious. The general approach we \noutline provides a repeatable framework for choosing a payload to satisfy a remote \nsensing mission. Once we select a physical phenomenology (e.g., measuring thermal \ninfrared radiance to detect forest fires), then two things need to be established.

By way of example, however, Table 9-13 provides a small sampling of \nremote sensing payloads and corresponding spacecraft missions. \n\nTABLE ~13.

We then introduce the basic types of \n\n\n\n276 Space Payload Design and Sizing 9.4 \n\n~tectors and collection techniques that are employed in the design of a remote sensing \nmstrument \n\nWe use various applications of imaging sensors, such as film cameras or electro-\noptical de~ces, to measure and analyze spatial features. Optical imaging in the visible \ns~ IS the most common ,approach for applications dealing with topographic \nmappmg and photogrammetry. Other sensors that rely fundamenta1ly on spatial mea-\nsurements include sounders and altimeters (Kramer [1996] lists examples of these \ntypes of sensors). \n\nSpatial resolution is a function of many different parameters of the remote sensing \nsystem. It isusua1ly different from the gro1!fU/ sample distance (GSD), the distance at \nwhich the sensor spatiaIly samples the target scene for sensors that have a correspon-\ndence between detector size and ground target size. For targets with very high contrast \n!o .the background, the. spatial resolution can be finer than the GSD-usua1ly however, \nIt IS on the order of twice the GSD. Alternatively, the spatial resolution can be charac-\nterized by the angle under which it sees the sma1lest target The sma1lest physical \nfeatures that can be discriminated using the sensor measurement characterize the lim-\nits of spatial resolution in a remote sensing system. Spatial resolution is a function of \nthe range from the se~or. to the target. the aperture and foca1length of the lens, and \nthe wavelength of the mCident energy. We can characterize the spatial resolution by \nthe angl~ that the sensor can resolve, or directly as the ground range in units of length \nfor the Size of the smaIlest object that can be discriminated. \n\nWe u.s~ spectromet.ers to ~alyze spectral content of a scene to identify the chemical \ncomposition of the objects bemg sensed. The spectral information received by a sensor \nis a composite of the spectral information emitted by all objects in the field-of-view. \nTJ:te ~tral ~ontent reaching a potential multispectral FireSat payload, for example, \nwill mclude signatures from soil, vegetation, and cities in addition to a fire that may \nbe present The combined spectral content of all these features may be very different \nfrom the spectrum of a forest fire by itself. Combining information from multiple spec-\n~ .bands has been ~ s~cessfully to differentiate key features and maximizing the \nutility of a sensor With a given spectral resolution. \n\nWe can use a multispectral sensor to uniquely determine the features within an \nimage. Multispectral systems typicaIly employ tens of bands. Hyperspectral and ultra-\nspectral systems employ hundreds and thousands of spectral bands, respectively. \nFollowing the example presented by Slater [1980, pp. 17-18], we consider a multi-\nspectral i~age of an area containing concrete, asphalt, soil, and grass. Figure 9-17 \nshows typical spectral reflectance for these four materials. If we have an imager with \n?n1y three bits of radiometric sensitivity Oow, medium, and high), then no single \nunage, whether panchromatic or filtered to a partiClllar band region could distinguish \nthese f?ur materials. However, a properly calibrated two-band multispectral system \ncan UDIquely resolve these four materials using bands in the 600-700 nm and 700-\n900 nm wavelengths. The returns for each of these materials is shown in Table 9-14. \nU~g mul~spectral sensors to study more complex scenes or to identify additional \n\nmatenals req~ more bands or narrow~r bandwidths. The number of spectral bands \nand the .bandWidth of each band determine the resolving power of a spectral sensor. \nWe achieve hi~er spectral resolution is achieved by narrower bandwidths, but using \nnarrower bandWidths tends to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio for the measurement \n\nWe can also use intensity information contained in the electromagnetic field to \nextract useful information for remote sensing purposes.

A \nsingle-band low-resolution sensor cannot distinguish all 4 types, but a 2-band, low-\nresolution sensor can, as shown In Table 9-14 [Slater, 1980). \n\nTABLE 11-14. Spectral Resolution for Sample Two-Band Sensor.

The abil-\nity to distinguish the intensity of radiance at the sensor goes beyond detecting either \nthe presence or absence of energy at a given wavelength. For example, if a FJreSat \nsensor were being designed to detect fires based on thermal emission, then the inten-\nsity information in the thermal signature would indicate the presence of fires. The \nradiometric resolution of the instrument needs to aIlow the system to discriminate \nbetween a forest fire and a campfire, for instance. \n\nMerely detecting the presence of thermal energy in a band region characteristic of \nburning biomass is not sufficient for satisfying the FJreSat mission. The number of bits \nused to represent the intensity information for a radiometric instrument will be dictated \nby two practical limits [Slater, 1980, p. 19]: (1) the sigIJa1-to-noise ratio present in the \ndata, and (2) the level of confidence we need to differentiate between two threshold \nsignal levels. \n\nRadiometric instruments measure the intensity of incoming energy_Radiometers \npassively measure the intensity, while scatterometers are active instruments that mea-\nsure surface roughness by sensing the backscattered field when a surface is illuminated. \nPolarimeters measure the polarization state of a tranSmitted, scattered, or reflected \nwave. Refer to Table 9-13 to see examples of these sensor types. \n\n\n\n278 Space Payload Design and Sizing 9.5 \n\nThe limiting factors in intensity measurement using radiometry are the signal-to-\nnoise ratio (SNR) of the sensor and the quantization levels of the measurement device. \nApplications requiring high radiometric accuracy include vegetation and soil analysis \nstudies, while applications such as sea surface temperature studies require less radio-\nmetric resolution. \n\nFigure 9-18 shows the resolution characteristics of an example sensor across the \nthree primary dimensions. The sensor is the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectro-\nradiometer (MODIS), a part of NASA's Earth Observing System. The MODIS scan-\nning radiometer has 36 channels that have been selected to enable advanced studies of \nland, ocean, and atmospheric processes. We will discuss applications of the MODIS \nsensor to the problem of automatic fire detection in Sec. 9.6. \n\nSpecIraI ResoIutfon \n(BandwIdth) \n\nSpaIIaJ Resolution \n(Ground Sample DlsIance) \n\n500m \n\nRadiometric Resolution \n(DynamIc Range) \n\nAg.9-18.

We want to be able to look at several options \nwithout necessarily designing each in depth. This section provides ways to compute \ndata rates and estimate the overall size and key parameters. In Sec. 9.6, we will apply \nthese values to the FtreSat example. \n\nr 9.5 Observation Payload Sizing Z79 \n9.5.1 Signal Processing and Data Rates \n\nAnalog signal processing is very similar for ceo read-out imagers and for infrared \nimagers using an integrated mulitplexer. In both cases weak analog signals need to be \namplified and conditioned, maintaining high dynamic range and high processing \nspeed. Electronic signal processing at high speeds with high accuracy can become a \ncost and schedule driver in the development of high-resolution instruments. Typically \nwe must incorporate massively parallel processing and tailored implementation tech-\nnologies to allow high-speed, high-accuracy analog processing. Concerns about elec-\ntromagnetic interference dictate that this processing be conducted as close to the focal \nplane assembly as possible. On the other hand, strict thermal decoupling between \nimagers and the heat dissipating electronics must be maintained. \n\nFor ceo imagers the dark signal typically doubles with each rise in temperature of \nseven degrees. Infrared imagers are usually cooled to low temperatures; therefore, we \nmust minimize each heat leak to their cryostat to keep the cooling power low. The \ncooling requirement becomes more stringent as the wavelength of the radiation to be \nmeasured becomes longer. For wavelengths in the 100 J.1ID range the detectors are typ-\nically cooled to 4 K. Even small heat leaks, such as those from the necessary electrical \nwiring and mechanical connection to the spacecraft, transport excess heat requiring \nhigh cooling power. \n\nPhoton \n\nTbnIng I Control \n\nInstrument Control \n\nPower Supply and Conditioning \n\nFig. 9-19. Block Diagram of an Optical Instrument. Photons are coDected by the CCD \nImager, then amplified and processed. The primary supporting functions of power and \ncontrol are also depicted. The sampDng process for charge coupled device signal pro-\ncessing typically uses correlated double sampling to eliminate reset noise. \n\nThe block diagram iri Fig. 9-19 shows the typical functional blocks found in the \nelectronics of an optical instrument The signal flow through the electronics begins \nwith the detector in the focal plane of the instrument It converts photons to analog \nelectrical signals, which are amplified and conditioned. Any additional signal process-\ning is performed in the digital data processing block. The analog and digital signal \n\n\n\n280 Space Payload Design and SiziDg 9.5 \n\nprocessing blocks operate syncbronously with the read-out of the imagers. The central \ntiming system supplies appropriate timing signals to all relevant circuit blocks to guar_ \nantee syncbronous operation. Because electrical signals processed in the instrument \nelectronics are weak, we have to pay special attention to power conditioning. Careful \nfiltering and clean electrical grounding must be implemented to decouple digital and \nanalog signals. \n\nThe instrument control computer manages the signal processing and timing func-\ntions performed by the instrument and it interfaces to the main spacecraft computer. \nDepending on the design; time-tagged commands are executed by the instrument \ncomputer or issued by the spacecraft computer. . \n\nAnalog signal processing for CCD imagers usually involves correlated double \nsampling. This technique takes two slightly time-shifted samples of the analog signal \nand subtracts one from the other to extract their image-related video signal. The adap-\ntation of this video signal to the input range of the analog-to-digital converter requires \nsetting gain and offset parameters for the system. Digital data processing normalizes \nthe imager pixels. Normalization requires that any non-uniformity in photo response \nand dark signal must be removed from each. pixel. This task is frequently conducted \non board the spacecraft because some of the most straightforward data compression \nalgorithms become invalid if the pixels are not normalized Furthermore, signal pro-\ncessing for normalizing pixels may be required if we use onboard calibration methods \nin the sensor. \n\nWe must select the process of normalizing pixels based on the characteristics of the \nsensor. For sensors with a linear response, one- or two-point correction is sufficient \nHighly nonlinear detectors, as is often the case for infrared detectors, require n-point \ncorrection techniques. Figure 9-20 illustrates an example of two-point correction. The \noffset (dark signal) and gain factor (response) are corrected by first subtracting the \nindividual offset value and then by dividing by the individual response for each pixel. \n\nOutput \n\n/P1xe11 \nI \n\n/ /P1xe12 \n\n,I \"\" \n/,,\" \u2022\u2022 ' Pixel n \n\nI~'\" \u2022..\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022.\u2022\u2022.\u2022\u2022.\u2022\u2022. \n\"I\" \u2022\u2022 ' ........\u2022.... \n\no =-------.Input \n\nOutput \n\nAll n pixels \n\n~-----_Input \n\nRg. 9-20.

To send this data stream to a ground station in real \ntime, the system may need several parallel channels with capacities up to 100 Mbps \n\n9.5 Observation Payload SiziDg 281 \n\neach. If data collection is short compared to the available downlink time, a buffer \nmemory can reduce the downlink data rate over a longer transmission time. \n\nThe trends for future systems indicate a tendency toward more onboard information \nextraction to decrease communication requirements. Several enabling technologies \nand techniques include powerful data processing hardware. Software uploads to the \nhardware must be possible to update and modify operational algorithms from the user \ncommunity. \n\nImage on \nthe Focal \nPlane #1 \n\nFig. 9-21. \n\nResponse of \nthe Pixels In Image on \nthe Focal the Focal \nPlane #1 Plane #2 \n\nHalf \nSpatial \n\nFrequency \n\nNyquIst \nUmIt \n\n\u2022 \nClear \n\nResponse of \nthe Pixels In Image on \nthe Focal the Focal \nPlane #2 Plane 113 \n\nClear \n\nResponse of \nthe Pixels In \n\nthe Focal \nPlane 113 \n\nMld-gray \n\nEffect of Sampling Frequency on Image Quality.

Sampling an \nDlumination pattem with twice the spatial frequency, resulting in a pixel response of \nmld-gray since every pixel Is Dlumlnated over exactly half Hs area. \n\nThe spatial sampling process of pixels in an optical instrument is determined by the \ngeometry of the detector elements and by the scanning principles employed for the \ndifferent sensor types discussed in Table 9-8. The sampling process can introduce \nerrors into the image data if we don't select it properly. The Nyquistfrequency is the \nlowest rate at which information with a given bandwidth must be sampled to avoid \nerrors. Figure 9-21 shows the effect of sampling three different illumination frequen-\ncies. The spatial frequency is defined as the inverse of the width of a black-and-white \nline pair, and is expressed in line pairs per meter. The sampling process is performed \nin all three cases by the same detector array (right of the arrows), that is, by the same \nspatial sampling frequency, defined as the inverse of the center distance of the \nsampling pixels. The maximum spatial frequency which can be reconstructed without \nerror after the sampling/restoration process is defined as the Nyquist frequency, which \nequals half the sampling frequency, shown in the middle diagram. The response of the \ndetector pixels is shown as intensity (gray level) in the three diagrams. On the left, \nsampling of an illumination pattern with half the spatial frequency. In the center, \nsampling of an illumination pattern with exactly the spatial frequency, showing that \nreconstruction of the original illumination pattern is feasible without error. (However, \nif the sampling pattern is shifted by half a pixel with respect to the illumination pattern, \n\n\n\n282 Space Payload Design and Sizing '.5 \n\nthen reconstruction fails). And on the right. sampling an illumination pattern with \ntwice the spatial frequency results in a pixel response of mid-gray since every detector \npixel is illuminated over half its area in the example. All samples in the third case show \nthe same constant value which corresponds to a spatial frtlquency of zero (line-pairs \nper meter) which was not present in the original scene. This creation of new frequen-\ncies is known as aliasing. Such frequency components cannot be removed by addition-\nal processing of the reconstructed image. Furthermore, the well known techniques to \neliminate aliasing in electronic signal processing (band limiting the input signal to an \nelectronic sampler using a low pass filter corresponding to the Nyquist condition) are \nnot feasible when we sample images in the spatial domain. Usually we cannot use our \noptical system as a band-limiting low pass filter since its aperture diameter and cut-off \nfrequency are usually defined by radiometric requirements. The result is that we usu-\nally have a certain amount of unavoidable aliasing which degrades the image quality \nof such systems. \n\n[ \nC \n0 \n\n'fi \ni .. \n~ \n~ \nI \n:::I \n\n'8 \n:5 \n\n0.8 \n\n0.6 \n\n1\\ ~ \n\"\\ I~ 1beoteIIcaJ MTF 01 clear aperture \n\n'\\ '\" 0.4 \n0.2 \n\n\"\" '\" ~ ~ TheoretIcal MTF 01 aperture ~ with central QbscwaIIon \n~-\n\n00 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 \n\nSpatial Frequency (F) \n\nFIg. 9-22.

The MTF starts \nat 1 for spatial frequencies near 0 and drops to 0 at the cutoff frequency, Fc :: Df J. h. \n\nThe ModUlation Transfer Function (MTF) is the ratio of the intensity variation of \nthe ground scene to the intensity variation of the image at a given spatial frequency. \nThe cut-off frequency is that spatial frequency at which the transfer function becomes' \nzero. lIigure 9-22 shows the theoretical M1F of an optical system with and without \ncentral obscuration.

Solar RadIometric Input. Radiometric Input (radiance In Wrrr2 rrr1 [wavelength]) of \nthe Sun at sea level as a function of the wavelength. \n\nThe integration of the spectral radiometric input over the spectral bandwidth gives \nthe power density in the spectral band of interest To first-order we can assume that \nlambertian (ideal) reflection with a constant reflection coefficient occurs at the target \nscene (this approximation holds for small spectral bandwidth). The area of the ground \npixel resulting in back-radiated power determines the power density per solid angle. \nThe atmosphere attenuates this radiation by a constant transmission factor (again \ninvoking an approximation for small spectral bandwidth). The effective aperture at \norbital altitude collects a very small fraction of this radiation resulting in the power at \nthe entrance of the optics. The signal power is attenuated further by transmissi()n \nthrough the optics, ultimately resulting in a lower power level at the detector pixe1. \nDuring the integration period a certain amount of energy (power times integrati()n \nperiod) is accumulated in each pixel. This energy is divided by the energy of Olle \nphoton (which is wavelength dependent) resulting in the number of available photOIls \nper pixe1. The quantum efficiency of the detector transforms this number of photOIlS \ninto the number of available electrons. These electrons comprise a charge packet and \ncorrespond to the output signal of the detector. . \n\nTo fully characterize the radiometric performance of an instrument. we must also \ndetermine the signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range. The signal-to-noise ratio \n\n\n\n284 Space Payload Design and Sizing 95 \n\ndescribes the image quality at a given intensity. Due to the quantum nature of light, the \nnumber of noise electrons (temporal noise) equals the square root of the number of \nsignal electrons. The read-out process of the imagers results in a certain number of \nadditional noise electrons. The temporal noise is added to the read-out noise since they \nare statistically independent values, resulting in a total number of noise electrons to be \nconsidered for the evaluation of the signal-to-noise ratio. \n\nThe dynamic range of the instrument is the quotient of signal- and read-out noise \nelectrons the sensor sees between dark and bright scenes at the given reflection coef-\nficient of the target scene. The maximum dynamic range is the difference between the \ndarkest and brightest possible scene. The brightest scene is typically reflection from \nclouds or snow. \n\nIn order to estimate the radiometric performance of optical instruments in the mid-\nand long-wavelength infrared spectrum, the spectral emission of the surface of the \nEarJ:h must be modeled. A blackbody with an equivalent temperature of 290 K can be \nused for this purpose. The atmospheric transmission as a function of the wavelength is \nwell known for a given path orientation and atmospheric characteristics. The multi-\nplication of the spectral radiance with the atmospheric transmission results in the \nupwelling radiance at the sensor. The integration of it over the selected bandwidth and \nthe multiplication with the area of the ground pixel results in the power per solid angle. \nAfter consideration of sensor altitude and effective apertuIl; of the receiving optics the \ninput power at the sensor's entrance aperture can be calculated. This transforms via the \noptical transmission factor to the input power at detector level (usually in the picoWatt \nregion). During the integration period a certain amount of energy is accumulated per \npixel. The division of that energy by the energy of one photon gives the number of \nphotons available per pixel which is transferred by the quantum efficiency to the avail-\nable number of electrons per pixel which correspond to its output signal. \n\nTo characterize the radiometric performance of an instrument with respect to the \ntemperature resolution, we must determine the noise-equivalent temperature differ-\nence ~T) for the instrument The noise equivalent temperature resolution is given \nby the temperature difference (at scene temperature), which generates a signal equiv-\nalent to the total noise electrons at scene temperature. The NEAT characterizes the \ninstrument in its ability to resolve temperature variations for a given background \ntemperature. \n\n9.5.3 Estimating Size, Weight, and Power \n\nWe must be able to estimate the size and main characteristics of the mission pay-\nload before completing a detailed design. We want to be able to look at several options \nwithout necessarily designing each in depth. This section provides ways to compute \ndata rates and estimate the overall size and key parameters. In Sec. 9.6.1, we will apply \nthese values to the FireSat example. \n\nWe have looked in some detail at the design of specific observation payloads in \nSec. 9.4. However, irrespective of the nature of the particular payload, we would like \nto estimate its size, weight, and power even before we have done a detailed design. To \ndo so, we can use three basic methods: \n\n\u2022 Analogy with existing systems \n\n\u2022 Scaling from existing systems \n\n\u2022 Budgeting by components \n\n9.5 Observation Payload Sizing 285 \n\nThe most straightforward approach is to use an analogy with existing systems. To \ndo this, we turn to the list of existing payloads in Table 9-13 in Sec. 9.4.3 or other pay-\nloads that we may be aware of which have characteristics matching the mission we \nhave in mind. Kramer [1996] offers a very thorough list of existing sensors. We look \nfor payloads whose performance and complexity match what we are trying to achieve \nand make a first estimate that our payload will have characteristics comparable to the \npreviously designed, existing payload. While this approach is rough, it does provide a \nfirst estimate and some bounds to decide whether the approach we have in mind is \nreasonable. \n\nA second approach, described in more detail below, is scaling the payload estimate \nfrom existing systems. This can provide moderately accurate estimates of reasonable \naccuracy if the scale of the proposed payload does not differ too greatly from current \npayloads. In addition, scaling provides an excellent check. Most existing payloads \nhave been carefully designed and optimized. If our new payload is either too large or \ntoo smaIl relative to prior ones, there should be some reason for this change in charac-\nteristics. If more detailed estimates based on detailed budgets don't scale from existing \nsystems, we must understand why. \n\nThe most accurate process for first-order payload sizing is budgeting by compo-\nnents. Here we develop a list of payload components such as detectors, optics, optical \nbench, and electronics. We then estimate the weight, power, and number of each. This \nis the best and most accurate approach but may be very difficult to apply at early mis-\nsion stages because we simply don't have enough initial information. Ultimately, we \nwill size the payload with budgeting by components. We will develop budgets as out-\nlined in Chap. 10 for each payload instrument for weight, power, and any critical \npayload parameters. These budgets will then help us monitor the ongoing payload \ndevelopment However, even with a detailed budget estimate, it is valuable to use \nscaling as a check on component budgeting. Again, we wish to understand whether the \ncomponents scale from existing payloads and, if not, why not. \n\nScaling from Existing Systems \nAn excellent approach for preliminary design is to adjust the parameters in \n\nTable 9-13 to match the instrument we are designing. We will scale the instruments \nbased on aperture-a main design parameter that we can determine from preliminary \nmission requirements. To scale, we compute the aperture ratio, R, defined by \n\n(9-16) \n\nwhere Ai is the required aperture of our new instrument, and Ao is the aperture of a \nsimilar instrument (Table 9-13). We then estimate the size, weight, and power based \non ratios with the selected instrument from Table 9-13, using the following: \n\nLj\"\"RLo L = linear dimensions (9-17) \n\nSi\"\"Lt S = swface area (9-18) \n\nVj\"\"I< V=volume (9-19) \n\nWi \"\"KR3Wo W=weight (9-20) \n\nPj\"\"KR3po P=power (9-21) \n\n\n\n286 Space Payload Design and Sizing 9.5 \n\nThe factor K should be 2 when R is less than 0.5, and 1 otherwise. This reflects an \nadditional factor of 2 in weight and power for increased margin when scaling the sys-\ntem down by a factor of more than 2. When the system grows, the R3 term will directly \nadd a level of margin. For instruments more than a factor of five smaller than those \nlisted in Table 9-13, scaling becomes unreliable. We recommend assuming a mass \ndensity of 1 gmIcm3 and power density of 0.005 W/cm3 for small instruments. An \nexample of these computations for FireSat is in Sec. 9.6.1. \n\n9.5.4 Evaluate Candidate Payloads \n\nMulti-attribute performance indices can be defined for comparing optical instru-\nments with similar performance characteristics, For high-resolution spatial \ninstruments three basic values describe the quality (corresponding to the information \ncontent) in the image. The three defining features are the signal-to-noise ratio at spatial \nfrequency zero (high SNR corresponds to high information content), the MTF of an \ninstrument at the Nyquist frequency (high MTF corresponds to high information \ncontent for sampling rates between zero and the Nyquist frequency), and the ground \nsample distance GSD (small GSD corresponds to high information content). We \ndefine a relative quality index (RQI) to allow straightforward quantitative compari-\nsons with a reference instrument denoted by the suffix ref. \n\nSNR MTF GSDref \nRQI = SNR,q MTF ref GSD (9-22) \n\nThis relative quality index allows the designer to trade requirements with respect to \neach other. For example, a higher SNR can compensate for a lower MTF at the Nyquist \nfrequency for a given GSD. Such comparisons allow for first-order insights into the \nrelationships between complexity, performance, and cost of candidate sensors. For \nexample, suppose we defme a reference instrument to have an SNR of 512, and an \nMTF of 0.5 and a GSD of 25 m. If we then compute design parameters for a particular \nmission, we can generate a relative quality index, or score, for our design with respect \nto the reference instrument For instance, if our design choices lead us to an instrument \nwith a SNR of 705.2. a MTF of 0.47 and a GSD of 30 m, then the RQI for this system \nwill be 108%. This index offers a straightforward method for comparing several com-\npeting sensors across three key performance measures. \n\n9.5.5 Observation Payload Design Process \n\nTable 9-15 contains the details of the design process for visible and infrared \nsystems. We begin with basic design parameters such as the orbital height, minimum \nobservation angle and ground resolution. We then compute the quantities that describe \nthe performance of the instrument In particular, we determine the pixel processing \nparameters and system data rate, the size of the optics for a given pixel size, and the \nradiometry of the sensor. Sample computations for the FrreSat payload are given in the \nthird column. \n\nThe data rate required for observation payloads depends on the resolution, cover-\nage, and amplitude accuracy. With the maximum look angle, 11, spacecraft altitude, h, \nand cross-track pixel size, X, we have to image 211h I X pixels per swath line (cross-\ntrack). With the spacecraft ground-track velocity Vg and the along-track pixel size Y \nwe have to scan Yg I Y swath lines in one second. If we quantify the intensity of \neach pixel by b bits (2b amplitude levels) we generate a data rate, DR, of \n\n9.5 Observation Payload Sizing \n\n21'1h V. ~ V. \nDR = _'_\".J..., b =:: _\"'W_,.J..., b \n\nX Y X Y \nbits/second (bps) (9-23) \n\nwhere 11 is the maximum look angle in radians. h is the orbit altitude, Vg is the space-\ncraft ground-track velocity, Sw is the swath width, X is the across-track pixel dimen-\nsion, and Y is the along-track pixel dimension. The approximation is good for small \nswath widths. The data rate can be increased by transmission overhead such as house-\nkeeping data or coding and it can be decreased by data compression.

Several approaches have been proposed and implemented \nto treat cost as an independent variable. For our purposes, it is sufficient to note that \ntrading cost and performance means it is no longer sufficient to state the mission \nrequirements clearly and realistically. Rather, the mission requirements become \ninvolved in the iterative process of design (see Fleeter [1996]). There are several \nexcellent descriptions of how to include cost as a system parameter rather than a given; \nsee for example Shishko and Jorgensen [1996]. \n\nWorking through the trade-offs associated with cost, performance, and require-\nments in this early stage of payload definition keeps payload designers focused on the \nbest sensor characteristics to maximize mission performance and minimize cost. \nDesigners sometimes have a tendency to want to perform a purely analytical evalua-\ntion of the costs and benefits of various design options. Unfortunately, the relative \nbenefits of different design features are difficult if not impossible to quantify in an \nunambiguous and universally accepted manner. Analysis can be very useful for \nproviding a common footing and level playing field for the different design attributes. \nilltimately, however, judgments about satisfying mission objectives within cost and \nschedule constraints rely on human insight, adding to the difficulty and importance of \nthis portion of the payload definition process. \n\nOnce we determine the final payload type and basic payload performance \nrequirements, then payload final design can commence. The final payload design \ncould be as simple as an evaluation of existing payloads that are available, or it could \ninvolve detailed design, fabrication, and testing of an entirely new instrument. The \nfinal step in the payload definition and sizing process is the decision to procure or fab-\nricate the spacecraft payload. \n\nIntegrating a payload into a spacecraft design introduces several practical consid-\nerations for the other payload subsystems. These derived requirement can have a \nsignificant impact on the rest of the spacecraft. Table 9-16 contains an overview of \nsome of the accommodation aspects of a payload as it impacts the other spacecraft \nsubsystems. Resolving the impact of these requirements means we must assess the \nperformance, cost, and technical risk of each subsystem to accommodate the payload. \n\n9.6 Examples \n\nWe present two examples of remote sensing payload designs-one very prelimi-\nnary and one very mature-to give an indication of the beginning and ending points \nof the design process. Sec. 9.6.1 provides an initial assessment of a payload to fulfill \nthe FrreSat mission. Sec. 9.6.2 describes features of the MODerate-Resolution \nImaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), one of the primary sensors on board the Earth \nObserving System EOS-AMI spacecraft, which has a fire detection capability. \n\n9.6.1 The FireSat Payload \n\nTo illustrate the preliminary design process for payloads, we will estimate the basic \nparameters for the FrreSat payload developed throughout Chaps. 1-8 and earlier in \nChap. 9. We cannot expect to carry out a detailed design without substantial input from \nan IR payload designer. Still, we would at least like to know whether the FireSat \npayload is the size of a shoebox or the size of a truck. \n\n\n\n292 Space Payload Design and Sizing 9.6 \n\nTABLE 9-16.

From this, we \ncan determine the angular radius of the Earth, p: \n\np = sin-I (RE/(RE + h\u00bb = 64.3 deg From Eq. (5-15) (9-24) \nA key parameter in the system design is the minimum elevation angle, E, at which \n\nthe system can work. We do not have an estimate of that yet. but we do know that IR \npayloads do not work well at small elevation angles. Therefore, we will tentatively \nassume a minimum elevation angle of 20 deg, recognizing that this may be a very crit-\nical trade at a later stage. With tltis assumption, we can compute the nadir angle range, \n11, the maximum ground-track angle or swath width, A., and the maximum range to the \ntarget. D, from the formulas in Sec. 5.2: \n\nsin 11 = cos E sin P 11 = 57.9 deg \n\nit= 90-11- E= 12.1 deg \n\nD = RE (sin it I sin 11) = 1,580 km \n\nFrom Eq. (5-25a) \n\nFrom Eq. (5-26) \n\nFrom Eq. (5-27) \n\n(9-25) \n\n(9-26) \n\n(9-27) \n\nThese equations imply that the sensor on board the spacecraft will have to swing \nback and forth through an angle of \u00b157.9 deg to cover the swath. The swath width on \nthe ground will be 2 x 12.1 = 24.2 deg wide in Earth-central angle, with a maximum \ndistance to the far edge of the swath of 1,580 km. Had we been able to work all the \nway to the true horizon (E = 0), the maximum Earth central angle would be 90 - P = \n27.5 deg, and the swath width would be 55 deg. Increasing the minimum elevation \nangle to 20 deg has very dramatically reduced the size of the available swath. \n\nWe next find the orbit period, P, and longitude shift per orbit. M., (Sec. 7.2): \n\nP = 1.659 x 1()-4 x (6,378 + hf312 = 98.8 min From Eq. (7-7) (9-28) \nM. = 1.65 x (360/24) = 24.8 deg FromEq. (5-17) (9-29) \n\nTherefore, at the equator, successive node crossings are 24.8 deg apart. Notice that \nthis is slightly larger but very close to the 24.2 deg swath width which we computed \nabove. This is an important characteristic for FrreSat. It would be extremely valuable \nto have the swaths overlap so that every FrreSat spacecraft can cover all locations on \nthe Earth twice per day. Therefore, in designing the payload, we should work hard to \nmaintain either the altitude or the minimum elevation angle to provide some swath \noverlap. Doing so could dramatically reduce the number of spacecraft required and \ntherefore the cost of the system. \n\nAs Fig. 9-24 shows, the swath width does not need to be quite as large as the \nspacing between nodes along the equator. Even at the equator, it is enough to have a \nswath width equal to S, the perpendicular separation between the ground tracks. In \nChap. 7, we selected an inclination for FtreSat of 55 deg to cover up to 65 deg latitude. \nConsequently, we can use the spherical triangle ABC shown in the figure to compute \nS as follows: \n\nS = sin-I (sin 24.8 deg sin 55 deg) = 20.1 deg (9-30) \nThe perpendicular separation between the orbits at the equator is 20.1 deg. Because \nthe swath width is 24.2 deg, we now have some overlap margin even at the equator and \nsubstantial margin at higher latitudes, which are the primary areas of interest. We \ncould, therefore, increase the minimum elevation angle to 25 deg. This. would be a \n\n\n\n294 Space Payload Design and Sizing 9.6 \n\nreasonable option. At present, we instead choose to hold E at 20 deg and to provide \nsome margin on altitude and elevation angle for later payload trades. \n\nRg.9-24. Computation of RreSat Ground-Track Parameters. \n\nWe next compute the required resolution and data rates for FrreSat. From Table \n1-5, we initially estimated the needed ground resolution as 30 m. Because this is meant \nto be a very low cost system, we will assume that the required resolution, B,., is at nadir \nso that from an altitude of 700 km we have: \n\nBr = 0.030nOO = 4.3 x 10-5 rad = 0.00245 deg (9-31) \nHad we made this requirement at the maximum slant range of 1,580 km, the required \nresolution would have been 0.001 deg. \n\nUsing this resolution, we can follow the procedure outlined in Table 9-15 to com-\npute the data rate for FrreSat as 85 Mbps. This data rate from the FrreSat sensor is very \nhigh. However, we will be able to reduce it in many ways. We could process the data \non board or, more simply, tum off the payload over the oceans or other areas where \nfire detection is of marginal utility. For now, we will leave the value as computed so \nthat we reniain aware of the data rate out the sensor, recognizing that this will be need \nto be reduced later in the system design. \n\nWe next compute mapping and pointing budgets for FireSat. We do not have a finn \nmapping requirement, but we do have some broad sense of what is needed. We begin, \ntherefore, with a rough estimate of performance parameters and create the mapping \nerror as a function of the elevation angle shown in Fig. 9-25A. In this figure, we have \nused a O.I-deg nadir angle and azimuth errors corresponding to a relatively inexpen-\nsive pointing system based on an Earth Sensor. We know we can go to a more expen-\nsive system if necessary. In looking at Fig. 9-25A, we see that the mapping error at our \nchosen minimum elevation angle of 20 deg is between 6 and 8 Ian. While we are not \n\nT \nExamples \n\ncertain what our mapping requirement is, we are reasonably sure that it is smaller than \n6 kIn. We need to locate fires more accurately than this. Note also that the accuracy \nhas been set almost entirely by our crude attitude number of 0.1 deg. \n\nThe next most critical parameter is the I-Ian error in target altitude. This means that \nwe assume we can determine the altitude of the fire above the Earth to 1 km-a rea-\nsonable accuracy with an oblate Earth model. But significantly improving this accma-\ncy would require carrying a map of the altitudes of all of the regions of interest. That \ncould be very difficult, particularly in mountainous areas, and would cost a lot more \nmoney. Therefore, it is of little value to drive the error in nadir angle down below ap-\nproximately 0.05 deg because it would no longer be the dominant error source. Fig. 9-\n25B shows the curves that we would achieve with the error in nadir angle reduced to \n0.05 deg and all of the other error sources remaining the same. Now the contribution \nof the errors in nadir angle and target altitude are comparable, so we will use this bud-\nget to establish a preliminary mapping requirement of 5.5 km at a 20-deg elevation an-\ngle, and 3.5 Ian at a 30-deg elevation angle. This may stiII be considerably more crude \nthan we would like, so we may need to revisit this issue. \n\n,km __ EnGr \n\n102030406060708090 0 10 2031140106070 ID&O SpIcoad-_ ..... - --_ .... _(dog) \nA. 0.1 deg NadIr Angle Error B. 0.05 deg Nadir Angle Error \n\nRg. 9-25.

The third column in \nthat table summarizes the results of the computations for a whiskbroom sensor design \nfor the FrreSat mission. \n\nThe example FireSat design addresses only initial feasibility of the instrument. \nSeveral challenges ~main with this design and addition iterations need to be made in \nthe context of mission requirements and constraints. The computed data rate of \n85 Mbps will present a design challenge, as will the multiple pixel scanner needed to \nscan 256 pixels simultaneously. This will require all 256 pixels to be read out in par-\nallel, and the signal processing will need to be designed accordingly. These features \npresent a particularly demanding element of the initial design. \n\n\n\n296 \n\n1 \n\n8 \n\n4 \n\nto. \ni~ \nE 0.2 \nl. \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\nf: \n1\n\n0.4 \n\n0.2 \n\n0 \n\n111 .1 \n1] IIJ'\" y' \n~ \n\nSpace Payload Design and Sizing 9.6 \n\n11\\ \nI \\ \nI \\ D8!Bdor t--I I.I\"\"!\"I-\n\nI 1.(\\ \n\nA \n\n\\.,. \nI \n\n~\\I.t.

If we consider a pixel at the limit of the field of view, then radiometric information \nbecomes indistinguishable from noise. From this point of view our current design is at \nthe limit of feasibility and may require changes to meet the SNR requirements. Finally \nthe F-number of the optics of 2. 7 (driven by the focal length of 0.7 m and an aperture \ndiameter of 26 em) is quite a demanding optical design. \n\n. We now select a \"similar instrument\" from Table 9-13 for our FIreSat example. \nWe appear to have two options: the Thematic Mapper or the Multispectral Mid-JR \ninstrument We tentatively select the Multispectral Mid-JR as our similar instrument \nand will scale from its fundamental parameters of 1.5 m x 1 m diameter, 800-kg \nweight, and 900 W po~er, for its I-m aperture. We first compute the aperture ratio, \n\nR = 0.2611.0 = 0.26 From (Eq. 9-16) (9-32) \nWith this fundamental ratio. we now estimate the FrreSat payload parameters as \n\nSize = 0.4 m x 0.3 m diameter \nWeight = 2 x 800 x 0.263 = 28 kg \nPower = 2 x 900 x 0.263 = 32 W \n\n1 \n9.6 Examples \n\nAs described in Sec. 9.5.3, we have incorporated a factor of 2 to provide margin for \nhaving substantially scaled down the payload size. The estimate of the linear dimen-\nsions needs to be adjusted as well to allow for the size of the scanner which will need \nto be mounted in front of the sensor optics and electronics. A rough estimate of the \nscanner dimensions is the same siz(l as the payload estimate. Thus, as summarized in \nTable 9-17, the budgeted dimensions for the optics plus scanner is 0.8 m long x 0.3 m \ndiameter. Thus, our first guess is that the FireSat payload is a moderately sized instru-\nment and could fit well on a small to medium-sized spacecraft. \n\nTABLE 9-17.

Several refinements and iterations on' the design \nhave the potential to result in a viable and cost-effective payload concept To illustrate \nthe end point of such a process, we tum our attention to MODIS, a large instrument \nand a mature design with a fire detection mission. \n\n. \n9.6.2 MODIS--A Real FireSat Example \n\nA detailed design for a spacecraft sensor that can automatically detect fires already \nexists. The MODIS instrument (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on \nthe Terra spacecraft has been designed for a comprehensive range of scientific inves-\ntigations into Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and land use-much more challenging than \nfundamental requirements for the FtreSat mission (therefore, MODIS may be over-\ndesigned for the FrreSat mission). However, the MODIS instrument represents a \nmature design and a sophisticated, space-based fire detection system. The features and \nconsiderations that drove the MODIS fire detection sensor and data processing \nalgorithms offer an opportunity to inform our broader discussion ofFtreSat throughout \nthis book. \n\n\n\n298 Space Payload Design and Sizing 9.6 \n\nThe developmen~ of the MODIS sensor for Terra traces its roots to the GOES and \nNOAA spacecraft, and it represents at least a decade of research and design to improve \nthe performance of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (A VHRR) flown \non the NOAA series of spacecraft. The MODIS sensor on Terra is a whiskbroom, elec-\ntro-optical system. Table 9-18 lists its technical characteristics and specifications. The \nMODIS instrument includes specific design features to capitalize on the physics of \nthermal detection of fires. MODIS fire products include detecting the incidence of fire, \nits location, emitted energy, its ratio of flaring to smoldering, and the area.burned (bum \nscar detection). These products are important for understanding the influence of bum-\ning biomass on many atmospheric processes as well as direct and indirect effects on \nterrestrial ecosystems [Kaufman and Justice, 1996]. The key innovations for the fue \ndetection algorithms include distinguishing the flaring and smoldering parts of the fire \nand the automatic algorithms for reporting the progress of fires. \n\nTABLE 9-18.

This chapter summarizes these techniques, \nwith emphasis on the conceptual design of the spacecraft vehicle. The following two \nchapters present more detailed design and manufacturing information. To design a \nspacecraft, we must understand the mission, including the payload's size and charac-\nteristics, plus significant system constraints such as orbit, lifetime, and operations. We \nthen configure a space vehicle to carry the payload equipment and provide the \nfunctions necessary for mission success. The design process shown in Table 10-1 \ninvolves identifying these functions, choosing candidate approaches for each function. \nand selecting the best approaches. This chapter presents design methods with rules of \nthumb that will help us roughly estimate the spacecraft design [Agrawal, 1986; Chetty, \n1991; Griffin and French, 1991]. \n\nAn unmanned spacecraft consists of at least three elements: a payload, a spacecraft \nbus, and a booster adapter. The payload is the mission-peculiar equipment or instru-\nments. The spacecraft bus carries the payload and provides housekeeping functions. \nThe payload and spacecraft bus may be separate modules, or the vehicle may be an \nintegrated design. The booster adapter provides the load-carrying interface with the \nboost vehicle~ The spacecraft may also have a propellant load and a propulsion kick \nstage. The propellant, either compressed gas, liquid or solid fuel, is used for velocity \ncorrections and attitude control. A kick stage,\u00b7 if used, is a separate rocket motor or \nliquid stage used to inject the spacecraft into its mission orbit. \n\n\u2022 Also called apogee boost motor, propulsion module, or integral propulsion stage. \n\n301 \n\n\n\n302 Spacecraft Design and Sizing \n\nTABLE 10-1.

Iterate, negotiate, and update requirements, constraints, design budgets Steps 1 to5 \n\nThe top-level requirements and constraints are dictated by the mission concept, \nmission architecture, and by payload operation. For instanCe, the selection of orbit is \nintimately tied to the selected mission and payload as described in Chaps. 6 and 7. \nFrom a spacecraft design standpoint, the orbit also affects attitude control, thermal \ndesign, and the electric power subsystem. However, most of these design effects are \nsecondary to the effect that the orbit can have on payload performance. The designer \ntherefore selects the orbit based on mission and payload performance, and computes \nthe required spacecraft performance characteristics such as pointing, thermal control, \npower quantity, and duty cycle. The spacecraft is then sized to meet these require-\nments. We can summarize succinctly the spacecraft bus functions: support the payload \nmass; point the payload correctly; keep the payload at the right temperature; provide \nelectric power, commands, and telemetry; put the payload in the right orbit and keep \nit there; and provide data storage and communications, if required. The spacecraft bus \nconsists of subsystems or equipment groups which provide these functions. Table 10-2 \nlists the somewhat arbitrary definitions of subsystems used here and in Chap. 11. The \ntable also includes alternate terminology and groupings you may encounter, along \nwith references to more detailed information. Sometimes the payload is also treated as \na subsystem. Chapters 9 and 13 discuss payload design. \n\nThe propulsion subsysiem provides thrust for changing the spacecraft's transla-\ntional velocity or applying torques to change its angular momentum. The simplest \nspacecraft do not require thrust and hence have no propulsion equipment. But most \nspacecraft need some controlled thrust, so their design includes some form of metered \npropulsion--a propulsion system that can be turned on and off in small increments. \nWe use thrusting to change orbital parameters, correct velocity errors, maneuver, \ncounter disturbance forces (e.g., drag), control attitude during thrusting, and control \nand correct angular momentum. The equipment in the propulsion subsystem includes \na propellant supply (propellant, tankage, distribution system, pressurant, and propel-\nlant controls) and thrusters or engines. Compressed gasses, such as nitrogen, and \nliquids, such as monopropellant hydrazine, are common propellants. Significant sizing \nparameters for the subsystem are the total impulse\" and the number, orientation, and \nthrust levels of the thrusters. Chapter 17 describes design and equipment for propul-\nsion subsystems. \n\nThe attitude determination and control subsystem measures and controls the \nspacecraft's angular orientation (pointing direction), or, in the case of a guidance, \nnavigation, and control system, both its orientation and linear velocity (which affects \nits orbit). The simplest spacecraft are either uncontrolled or achieve control by passive \n\nr \n303 \n\nTABLE 10-2. Spacecraft Subsystems.

More complex \nsystems employ controllers to process the spacecraft attitude, and actuators, torquers. \nor propulsion subsystem thrusters to change attitude, velocity, or angular momentum. \nSpacecraft may have several bodies or appendages, such as solar arrays or communi-\ncation antennas, that require individual attitude pointing. To control the appendages\" \nattitude, we use actuators, sometimes with separate sensors and controllers. The \ncapability of the attitude control subsystem depends on the number of body axes and \nappendages to be controlled, control accuracy and speed of response, maneuvering \nrequirements, and the disturbance environment. Section 11.1 discusses design of the \nattitude determination and control subsystem. \n\nThe communications subsystem links the spacecraft with the ground or other \nspacecraft. Information flowing to the spacecraft (uplink or forward link) consists of \ncommands and ranging tones. Information flowing from the spacecraft (downlink or \nreturn link) consists of status telemetry and ranging tones and may include payload \ndata. The basic communication subsystem consists of a receiver, a transmitter, and a \nwide-angle (hemispheric or omnidirectional) antenna. Systems with high data rates \nmay also use a directional antenna. The communications subsystem receives and \ndemodulates commands, modulates and transmits telemetry and payload data, and \nreceives and retransmits range tones-modulation that allows signal turnaround time \ndelay and hence range to be measured. The subsystem may also provide coherence \nbetween uplink and downlink signals, allowing us to measure range-rate Doppler \nshifts. We size the communications subsystem by data rate, allowable error rate, \ncommunication path \"length, and RF frequency. Section 11.2 and Chap. 13 discuss \ndesign of the communications SUbsystem. \n\n\n\n304 Spacecraft Design and Sizing lo.t \n\nThe command and doJa. handling subsystem distributes commands and accu-\nmulates, stores, and formats data from the spacecraft and payload. For simpler \nsystems, we combine these functions with the communications subsystem as a track-\ning, telemetry, and command subsystem. This arrangement assumes that distributing \ncommands and formatting telemetry are baseband extensions of communications \nmodulation and demodulation. In its more general form, the subsystem includes a \ncentral processor (computer), data buses, remote interface units, and data storage units \nto implement its functions. It may also handle sequenced or programmed events. For \nthe most part, data volume and data rate determine the subsystem's size. Section 11.3 \ndiscusses subsystem design, and Chap. 16 covers computers and software. \n\nThe power subsystem provides electric power for the equipment on the spacecraft \nand payload. It consists of a power source (usually solar cells), power storage (batter-\nies), and power conversion and distribution equipment. The power needed to operate \nthe equipment and the power duty cycle determine the subsystem's size, but we must \nalso consider power requirements during eclipses and peak power consumption. \nBecause solar cells and batteries have limited lives, our design must account for power \nrequirements at beginning-of-life (BOL) and end-of-life (EOL). Section 11.4 discusses \ndesign of the power subsystem. \n\nThe thermal subsystem controls the spacecraft equipment's temperatures. It does so \nby the physical arrangement of equipment and using thermal insulation and coatings to \nbalance heat from power dissipation, absorption from the Earth and Sun, and radiation \nto space. Sometimes passive, thermal-balance techniques are not enough. In this case, \nelectrical heaters and high-capacity heat conductors, or heat pipes, actively control \nequipment temperatures. The amount of heat dissipation and temperatures required for \nequipment to operate and survive determine the subsystem's size. Section 11.5 \ndiscusses temperature control in more detail. \n\nThe structural subsystem carries, supports, and mechanically aligns the spacecraft \nequipment. It also cages and protects folded components during boost and deploys \nthem in orbit. The main load-carrying structure, or primary structure, is sized by either \n(1) the strength needed to carry the spacecraft mass through launch accelerations and \ntransient events during launch or (2) stiffness needed to avoid dynamic interaction \nbetween the spacecraft and the launch vehicle structures. Secondary structure, which \nconsists of deployables and supports for components is designed for compact packag-\ning and convenience of assembly. Section 11.6 discusses stn,lctural design. \n\n10.1 Requirements, Constraints, and the Design Process \n\nIn designing spacecraft, we begin by developing baseline requirements and \nconstraints such as those in Table 10-3. If some of the information is not available, we \nmay need to assume values or use typical values such as those presented here or in the \nfollowing chapters. For successful design, we must document all assumptions and \nrevisit them until we establish an acceptable baseline. \n\nTo get a feel for the size and complexity of a spacecraft design, we must understand \nthe space mission: its concept of operations, duration, overall architecture, and con-\nstraints on cost and schedule. Even if we select a mission concept arbitrarily from \nseveral good candidates, clearly defining it allows us to complete the spacecraft design \nand evaluate its performance. \n\nThe payload is the single most significant driver of spacecraft design. Its physical \nparameters-size, weight, and power~ominate the physical parameters of the \n\n10.1 Requirements, Constraints, and the Design Process 305 \n\nTABLE 10-3.

Payload operations and support are key requirements for the spacecraft's \nsubsystems, as well. The payload may also impose significant special requirements \nthat drive the design approach, such as cryogenic temperatures or avoidance of con-\ntamination. Fortunately, we often understand the payload's characteristics better than \nthe spacecraft's overall characteristics in the early design phases. Thus, we can infer \nmany important design features by understanding the payload and how it operates. \n\nChapters 6 and 7 show how orbital characteristics affect the mission. In spacecraft \ndesign, the orbit affects propulsion, attitude control, thermal design. and the electric \npower subsystem. Most of these design effects are secondary to the orbit's effect on \npayload performance. Therefore, we select the orbit based on mission and payload per-\nformance. Then we compute the performance characteristics needed for the spacecraft. \nsuch as pointing, thermal control, and power quantity and duty cycle. Fmally, we size \nthe spacecraft to meet these needs. \n\nThe natural space environment--especially radiation--limits two aspects of space-\ncraft design: usable materials or piece parts, and spacecraft lifetime. Radiation levels \nand dose must be considered in the design, but they do not normally affect the system's \nconfiguration or ability. Chapter 8 provides useful space environment information. \nHowever, some types of hostile (weapon) environments may affect countermeasmes, \nconfiguration, shielding, or maneuvering ability. \n\nSelecting a boost vehicle and the possible use of kick stages are central issues in \ndesigning a spacecraft. We must select a booster that can put at least the minimum \nversion of our spacecraft into its required orbit Chapter 18 describes available boost-\ners, all of which have limited weight-lifting ability. In most cases, we must extrapolate \npublished data to meet our mission requirements. Chapters 6 and 7 present the laws of \norbital mechanics and the techniques of trajectory design. These include methods for \ncomputing velocity increments and guidance techniques. In some cases, the spacecraft \nmust provide large amounts of velocity just to reach orbit or to guide the flight path. \nChapter 17 presents performance characteristics for solid and liquid propulsion kick \nstages to implement these functions. Common nomenclature for a kick stage used to \ninject a spacecraft into transfer orbit is a perigee kick motor (PKM), whereas a kick \nstage used to circularize at high altitude is called an apogee kick motor (AKM). \n\nThe booster selection will also affect a spacecraft's linear dimensions. An aerody-\nnamic cover, called a/airing, or shroud, protects the spacecraft as it travels through \nthe atmosphere. The fairing's diameter and length limit the spacecraft's size-at least \nwhile it is attached to the booster. Chapter 18 presents the size of standard fairings for \nvarious boosters. If the on-orbit spacecraft is larger than the fairing, it must be folded \nor stowed to fit within the fairing and unfolded or deployed on orbit To design an item \nwith a large area but small intrinsic mass, such as a solar array or antenna, we make \nthe item as light as possible, fold it and protect it during boost, and deploy it (unfold, \npull, or stretch it into shape) on orbit Solar cells may rest on lightweight substrates or \neven on film that is folded or rolled for storage. Antenna reflectors have consisted of \nfolded rigid panels or of fabric, either film or mesh. Thus, we meet the launch vehicle'S \ndemands for a smaller spacecraft by using a stowed configuration and then deploying \nthe spacecraft to meet the full size needed on orbit We use weight efficiently by \ncaging and protecting the light-weight deployables during boost \n\nThe ground system interface determines how much ground operators and the space-\ncraft can interact-an important part of design. The periods of visibility between \nground stations and the spacecraft limit ground control of spacecraft operations or \ncorrections of errant behavior. Visibility periods and ground coverage issues are \n\n10.1 Requirements, Constraints, and the Design Process 307 \n\ndescribed in Chap. 5. If ground operations cost too much, we may want the spacecraft \nto operate autonomously-mtother major design decision. \n\nTable 10-4 lists initial configuration decisions or trade-offs designers often face. \nWeight, size, and power requirements for the payload place lower limits on \nspacecraft's weight, size, and power. The spacecraft's overall size may depend on such \npayload parameters as antenna size or optical system diameter. Our approach to space-\ncraft design must match these dimelll!ions and provide fields of view appropriate to the \npayload functions. The spacecraft must generate enough power to satisfy the payload \nneeds as well as its own requirements. The amount of power and the duty cycle will \ndictate the size and shape of solar arrays and the requirements for the battery. \n\nTABLE 10-4. Initial Spacecraft Design DecIsions or Trade-offs.

Instruments, sensors, solar arrays, and thermal radiators all have pointing and \nfield-of-view requirements that must be satisfied by their mounting on the spacecraft \nand the spacecraft's orientation. In the simplest case, all items are fixed to the body, \nand control of the body's attitude points the field of view. In more complex cases, \nsingle or two-degree-of-freedom mechanisms articulate the field of view. \n\nWe must also establish how to configure the spacecraft's propulsion early in the \ndesign process. Although interaction with the Earth's gravity or magnetic field caJl \ncontrol attitude, it cannot change the spacecraft's velocity state. If spacecraft velocity \ncontrol is needed, some form of metered propulsion must be used. If we decide to Use \nmetered propulsion,we should look at using this system for such functions as attitude \ncontrol or as an orbit transfer stage. Most attitude-control systems use metered pro-\n\n\n\n308 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.2 \n\npulsion to exert external torque on the spacecraft. Selecting a propulsion approach \n. depends on the total impulse requirement, and the propulsion system's performance, \nas discussed in Chap. 17. \n\n10.2 Spacecraft Configuration \n\nTo estimate the size and structure of a spacecraft, we select a design approach, \ndevelop a spacecraft configuration (overaIl arrangement) and make performance \nallocations to the spacecraft subsystems. We then evaluate the resulting design and \nreconfigure or reallocate as needed. Subsequent iterations add design detail and pro-\nvide better allocations. The process of allocating design requirements involves two \nmutually supporting techniques. Frrst, the allocated design requirements are dictated \nby considering the overall spacecraft design-a top-down approach. Alternatively, the \nallocated design requirements are developed by gathering detailed design informa-\ntion-a bottom-up approach. For instance, we may allocate 100 kg for structuraI \nweight based on 10% of the overall spacecraft weight This is a top-down allocation. \nHowever, a detailed design of the structure may require 120 kg if aluminum is used \nand 90 kg if composites are used. These are bottom-up allocations, providing us with \nthe opportunity to trade off alternatives and reallocate requirements to optimize the \ndesign. Most of the allocation methods presented in this chapter are top-down. They \nprovide a starting point for the allocation process. However, we should use them in \nconjunction with bottom-up design from the more detailed information given in \nChaps. II, 16, and 17. \n\nFigure 10-1 shows different spacecraft configurations. First, observe that each of \nthese spacecraft has a central body or equipment compartment that houses most of the \nspacecraft equipment. Second. note that these spacecraft all have solar arrays either \nmounted on external panels or on the skin of the equipment compartment. And finally \nnote that some of the spacecraft have appendages carrying instruments or antennas \nattached to the main compartment. Let's examine each of these configuration features \nin more detail. \n\nTable 10-5 lists the factors called configuration drivers leading to the various \nconfigurations. The weight, size and shape of the payload. and the boost vehicle diam-\neter drive the size and sh~pe of the equipment compartment. Table 10-5 also presents \nrules of thumb based on analysis of a large number of spacecraft designs. This analysis \nshows that the average spacecraft bus dry weight (spacecraft weight excluding propel-\nlant) is approximately twice that of the payload. The minimum spacecraft bus dry \nweight is equal to the payload weight and is achieved only when the payload is \nmassive and compact At the other extreme, low-density payloads or those consisting \nof multiple instruments can lead to a spacecraft bus as massive as 6 times the payload. \nAlthough this is a large range of possible spacecraft bus weights, these ratios are at \nleast a bound. Section 10.3 shows how to refine the estimate. \n\nThe spacecraft equipment compartment volume can be estimated from its weight. \nFor 75 spacecraft launched between 1975 and 1984, the average spacecraft in launch \nconfiguration with propellant loaded and all appendages folded had a density of only \n79 kglm3 with a maximum of 172 kglm3 and a minimum of 20 kglm3\u2022 However, \nappendages are usually lightweight, so the weight of the equipment compartment is \nonly slightly less than the total spacecraft weight. We can use this experience to esti-\nmate the spacecraft size (volume and dimensions) by the steps shown in Table 10-6. \nWe start with payload weight to obtain an estimate of spacecraft bus weight (e.g., \n\n10.2 Spacecraft Configuration \n\nA.

We now use an estimated density (e.g., 79 kglm3) to \ncompute the spacecraft volume. We select an equipment compartment shape and \ndimensions to provide this volume, match the payload dimensions, and fit within the \nbooster diameter. \n\nUsually, a spacecraft in folded launch configuration is cylindrically symmetric, \nmounted on the booster with the axis of symmetry parallel to the thrust axis. The \nfolded spacecraft diameter is designed to fit within the boost vehicle diameter although \non rare occasions a bulbous fairing may be used to provide a slightly larger diameter. \n(Bulbous fairings are generally avoided because they detract from booster perfor-\nmance.) Since the equipment compartment diameter is approximately the same as the \nfolded spacecraft diameter, we can use the boosre,- diameter as an upper limit for the \nequipment comparbnent diameter and select a compartment shape to fit within this \ndiameter. Knowing its volume, we can readily compute the compartment's length. \nTable 10-28 in Sec. 10.5 provides formulas for comparbnent parameters for a cubic \n\n\n\n312 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.2 \n\nTABLE 10-5.

Figure 10-1 shows examples of various \nspacecraft compartment shapes. \n\nSpacecraft solar arrays are of two types: body mounted and panel mounted. Exam-\nples of both types are shown in Fig. 10-1. An array produces about 100 W 1m2 of \nprojected solar cell area. This is unregulated power and represents an array efficiency \nof 7%. To use this rule of thumb, we need to estimate the total spacecraft power, as \n\n10.2 Spacecraft Configuration 313 \n\ndescribed in Sec. 10.3. However for initial configuration selection, we need only \nbound the power requirements and see if there is sufficient area on the equipment \ncompartment to allow body-mounted cells. At a minimum, power must be provided \nfor the payload. Prudent design would also make some allowance for spacecraft bus \npower and battery recharge power which are discussed in more detail in Sec. 10.3. If \nthere is insufficient area on the spacecraft body for a body-mounted array, then we are \nforced to use panels. \n\nEvaluation of pointing and attitude control on spacecraft configuration starts with \nidentifying all pointing requirements (see Table 010 .. 13) for both the spa~ bus IlD;d \npayload. The process of synthesizing a control approach t? meet th~ ~ments IS \ndiscussed in Sec. 10.4.2. Although we must go through this process m detail to see the \nfull effect of pointing on the spacecraft configuration, the basic implications can be \nderived by the process and rules of thumb in Table 10-5. The spacecraft configuration \nmust provide 2 axes of control for each item that is to be pointed. The spacecraft body \nhas 3 axes so the body alone can satisfy one pointing requirement; for instance, one \nbody axis (Le .\u2022 the yaw axis) can be pointed toward nadir by control about the other 2 \naxes (roll and pitch). If tWo items are to be pointed, then the spacecraft must be \nconfigured with at least one articulated joint between the two items. For illustration, a \nbody-mounted antenna can be pointed toward nadir by controlling 2 axes of body \nattitude. A solar array can then simultaneously be pointed toward the Sun by using the \nthird body axis and providingoa single axis solar array drive to control the solar array \nattitude relative to the body. This approach is called yaw steering (see 000, \nFig. 10-1C). If the spacecraft has a second item that must point in another direction \n(say, an antenna that must point toward a communication relay satellite), th~ the \nconfiguration must provide 2 more axes of control. The TORS spacecraft shown m Fig \n100lB has 3 separate articulated antennas with a total of 6 mechanical axes of control \nin addition to 3 axes 9f body attitude control and I axis of solar array control. DSP, \nshown in Fig IO-IB, has a body-mounted payload and uses control of two body axes \nto point toward nadir. The third body axis is used to scan the payload field-of .. view. A 0 \ncommunication antenna is articulated about 2 axes to point toward a ground station, \nand although solar array panels are used to augment the solar array area. the array is \nnot articulated. \n\nSpin stabilization is a particularly simple and robust method of attitude control. \nSatellites that employ spin stabilization are often cylindrical, such as DSCS n shown \nin Fig IO-IA. For such a satellite, the spin axis supplies I axis of control by using a \nmotor-driven platform that is despun (spinning in a negative sense relative to the \nsatellite body). This is sometimes called a dual-spin system. Equipment mounted on \nthe despun platform can be articulated about additional axes to achieve further point-\ning capability. \n\nThe attitude control method may also interact with the solar array configuration. \nSolar panels may be body-fixed such as Explorer VI and DSP, or they may be articu-\nlated, as shown on 000 and TORS in Fig. 10-1. Spin-stabilized spacecraft usually \nhave body-fixed arrays, and 3-axis-controlled spacecraft generally use articulated \npanels. The power generated by a solar array is proportional to the area th;lt intercepts \nsunlight (the projected area). A planar array which is pointed toward the Sun has a \nratio of total array area to projected area of one. A cylindrical array which has its \naxis perpendicular to the Sun line has a ratio of lin and an array which projects equal \narea in all directions has a ratio of 114. The method of solar array pointing control and \nthe type of array selected therefore affect the total array area. \n\n\n\n314 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.3 \n\nSometimes a spacecraft configuration is driven to use long booms either to control \nspacecraft moment of inertia or to separate delicate instruments from the spacecraft \nbody electrical fields. GEOSAT, shown in Fig. 1001C, uses a boom to increase the \nmoment of inertia and provide gravity-gradient attitude stabilization, a passive attitude \ncontrol technique described in Sec. 11.1. 000, also shown in Fig. 1 0-1 C, uses booms \nto isolate payload magnetometers from the spacecraft body. \n\n10.3 Design Budgets \n\nWe begin allocating performance by establishing budgets* or allocations for \npropellant. power, weight. and reliability. We can derive the propellant budget by \nestimating the propellant requirements for velocity changes (orbit correction and \nmaintenance) and attitude control. At first. we estimate the power budget by adding \nthe payload's power requirements to power estimates for the spacecraft bus \nsubsystems. To derive the first weight budget for the spacecraft, we add the payload \nweight to estimates for the spacecraft bus, including propulsion components and \npower components. We make the initial reliability budget by defining the probability \nof achieving acceptable spacecraft performance and lifetime. \n\nA typical propellant budget as shown in Table 10-7 contains four elements: veloc-\nity-control propellant, attitude-control propellant, margin, and residual. The velocity-\ncorrection requirement is expressed as total velocity change or AV, which is obtained \nfrom Sec. 7.3. Chapter 17 presents the rocket equation Eq. (17-21) by which we \ncorivert velocity change to propellant mass. Attitude-control propellant is used for spin \nstabilization and maneuvering while spinning, countering disturbance torques (in-\ncluding control during A V thrusting), attitude maneuvering, and limit cycling or \noscillation. Formulas for these entries are presented in Sec. 10.4.2 and summarized in \nTable 10-7.

If the spacecraft has several operating modes \nthat differ in power requirements, we must budget separately for each mode, paying \nparticular attention to peak power needs for each subsystem. The second step is battery \nsizing, or selecting the battery capacity appropriate to the spacecraft power require-\nments and battery cycle life. With size established, we can compute the battery's \nrecharge power. The third step is accounting for power-subsystem degradation over \nthe mission life by computing radiation damage to the solar array. \n\nTABLE 10-8.

These percentages change with the spacecraft's \ntotal power use, so I have presented ranges for a minimum \u00ab100 W), a small (200 W), \nand a medium to large spacecraft (500-10,000 W). We can use these values as a start-\ning point if we do not have more information, but Sec. 10.6 and Chap. 11 give specific \nexamples of various power requirements. \n\nSections 10.4.6 and 11.3 discuss battery recharge power. At the minimum, the \nrecharge energy must exceed the energy drawn from the battery duriJ;lg discharge by \nan amount that accounts for the efficiency of the charge-discharge process (typically \n80%). Most batteries also require recharge at a minimum rate-speeified as a fraction \nof battery capacity (typically 1115). These two requirements translate into recharge \npower ranging from 7% of the discharge power for geosynchronous orbits to 60% for \nlow-altitude orbits. . \n\nThe solar array must supply enough power for operations and recharging the \nbattery until end-of-life. The beginning-of-life power requirement must allow for \ndegradation in the solar array. As Sec. 11.4 points out, this\u00b7 degradation depends on \norbit altitude and radiation environment. but 30% is typical for 10 years at geosyn-\nchronous altitude. We can assume the same value for altitudes of 800 km or less_ \nBetween these altitudes the degradation is much larger. \n\nTable 1()\"10 shows the build-up of spacecraft weight. As pointed out in Sec. IO~ \nthe ratio of spacecraft dry weight to payload weight lies in the range of 2: 1 to 7: 1; the \npayload weight is typically less than half the spacecraft dry weight and may be as little \n\n\n\n316 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.3 \n\nTABLE 10-9.

Spacecraft structure weight generally falls in the range of \n15% to 25% of spacecraft dry weight (see Appendix A). Spacecraft structural weight \nmay also be estimated at 8% to 12% of injected weight (dry weight + propellant + \ninjection stage). Spacecraft thenna1 subsystem weight is between 2% and 5% of space-\ncraft dry weight. Weight percentages for other subsystems vary widely and require \nmore detailed investigation. (See Sec. 10.43, Chaps. 11 and 17.) To account for \nuncertainties during preliminary design we add 25% to these weights for new equip-\nment and 5% or less for known hardware. We should hold a small allowance (1 % to \n2%) at the system level to account for integration hardware, such as brackets and \nmounting hardware, which are often overlooked. \n\nTABLE 10-11.

Effect \nmodes of failures can be reduced and reliability raised by \n\nchanging the design, selecting more reliable \nhardware, or adding redundant hardware and \nsoftware. \n\nFrom the start of the spacecraft design we must design our hardware and software \nto achieve reliable operation. The process of design-for-reliability starts in the con-\nceptual design phase with the determination of system reliability requirements and \nallocation of these requirements to the spacecraft subsystems. This is a four-part \nprocess as shown in Table 10-11. FIrSt. we establish the mission success criteria. \nwhich is a list of events and operations that together constitute success. Second, we \nassign a numerical probability to meeting each element of the mission success criteria \nand select a set of ground rules for computing the probability of success. Third, we \nallocate reliability requirements to all spacecraft hardware and software. Fourth, we \n\n\n\n318 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.4 \n\nevaluate system reliability and iterate the design to maximize the reliability assess-\nment; and identify and eliminate failure modes. (See Sees. 10.5.2 and 19.2 for further \ndiscussions of reliability.) \n\n10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus \n\n10.4.1 Propulsion Snbsystem \n\nThe propulsion equipment for a spacecraft inclUdes tankage to hold the propellant, \nlines and pressure-regulating equipment, and the engines or thrusters. Common \npropellants are pressurized gas such as nitrogen, selected monopropellants such as \nhydrazine, and bipropellants. The pressurized feed systems typically used may be \npressure regulated or blow down. Important design parameters are the number, orien-\ntation, and location of the thrusters; the thrust level; and the amount of impulse \nrequired. Chapter 17 discusses the design of propulsion subsystems and characteristics \nof propulsion components. \n\nThe propulsion tanks rest at or near the spacecraft's center of mass to avoid shifting \nof the center of mass as the propellant is used. Engines for translational control are \naligned to thrust through the center of mass, whereas engines for attitude control thrust \ntangentially and are mounted as far away from the center of mass as possible to \nincrease the lever arm and thus increase the torque per unit thrust Attitude control \nengines which fire in the direction of flight (along or in opposition to the velocity \nvector) are generally used in pairs to produce a pure torque without net linear force. \nHowever, the spacecraft flight path is less sensitive to thrust at right angles to the \nvelocity vector and single attitude control engines are sometimes used in these \ndirections. Three-axis control requires a minimum of 6 attitude control thrusters, and \nmany designs use 8 to 12 plus backup units for reliability. \n\nTable 10-12 gives weight and power estimates for the propulsion subsystem. \nChapter 17 gives more detailed weights and See. 10.6 offers examples of integrated \ndesigns. The propulsion subsystem does not use much electrical power unless it \nempl01s thrusters with heated catalyst beds, heated thrusters, or electric propulsion. \nElectric propulsion is rare, but heated thrusters are common. Propulsion lines and. \ntanks must be protected from freezing, usually by thermostatically controlled guard \nheaters. Power for these heaters is included in the thermal subsystem. Electrically \noperated solenoid valves control propellant flow to the thrusters, but we account for \ntheir power in the ADC subsystem. \n\nTABLE 10-12.

Table 10-13 lists possible design requirements. If we must \ncontrol the attitude of all or part of the payload, we have to decide whether to point the \nentire spacecraft or to articulate the payload or part of the payload. In the extreme case \nof a scanning payload fixed to the spacecraft's body, we must scan with the entire \nspacecraft. Similar decisions are necessary for parts of the spacecraft that need orient-\ning in other directions such as pointing at the Sun. \n\nTABLE 10-13.

If, for example.\u00b7 a payload or antenna \nmust point toward the Earth, we need to control its attitude about 2 horizontal axes. If \nthe payload is fixed to the spacecraft's body, these 2 axes are 2 of the 3 axes. Thus, we \ncan use the third axis-rotation about the pointing axis-to satisfy a second pointing \nrequirement, such as pointing one axis in the direction of flight Table 10-14 lists types \nof pointing systems. \n\nEither spin stabilization or 3-axis control using sensors and torquerS can be used to \ncontrol the spacecraft's attitude. Spin stabilization divides into passive spin, spin with \nprecession control, or dual spin (spin with a despun platform). ClasseS of 3-axis \ncontrol depend on the sensor type or torquing method. Possible sensors include Earth, \nSun and star sensors, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and directional antennas. Torquers \ninclude gravity gradient, magnetic, thrusters, and wheels. Wheels include variable \nspeed reaction wheels; momentum wheels, which have a nominal nonzero speed and \ntherefore provide angular momentum to the spacecraft; and control moment gyros, \n\n\n\n320 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.4 \n\nwhich are fixed-speed gimballed wheels. Table 10-15 summarizes these methods of \ncontrol during thrusting and nonthrusting. \n\nTABLE 10-14 \u2022.

Spin-stabilized satellites with a despun platform, called a \ndual spm system, frequently support communications payloads. In this case, we mount \nth~ p~yload antenna on !he despun platfonn so we can control its pointing. If the spin \nllXlS IS roughly perpendicular to the Sun line, we can mount solar cells on the space-\ncraft's cylindrical skin to produce electric po~er. \n\nThree-axis approaches range from passive control using gravity gradient or mag-\nnetics to full active control with propulsion thrusters and wheels. Passive techniques \ncan proVIde coarse control to support low-accuracy pointing requirements and simple \nspacecraft. The active 3-axis method gives us highly accurate pointing control more \nefficient solar arrays (by allowing oriented planar arrays), and pointing of ~veral \npayloads or spacecraft appendages. But active 3-axis systems are more complex and \n\nT 10.4 DesIgning the Spacecraft Bus 321 \nusually heavier than spin-stabilized ones, and we may need to consider both \napproaches carefully before deciding between them. Table 10-16 summarizes how \nvarious requirements affect this decision. \n\nTABLE 10-18.

It uses ground tracking to measure the flight path (or spacecraft ephemeris), \nground computing of desired velocity corrections, and command of the correction \nthrough the communications and command subsystems. The direction of the velocity \ncorrection is governed by the attitude control of the spacecraft body and the magnitude \nis controlled by engine firing time. Two elements limit perfonnance: ground-tracking \nand spacecraft attitude-control during thrusting. The Global Positioning System (GPS) \nmay provide another way to measure the flight path. Coupled with an appropriate \nguidance computer, a GPS receiver should be able to guide the boost phase and allow \nthe spacecraft to navigate autonomously in orbit, at least for low altitudes. Other \nautonomous navigation methods are also available (see Sec.I!.7). Guiding spacecraft \nto intercept or rendezvous usually requires a guidance radar, a gyroscope reference \nassembly, and often accelerometers. \n\nAccurate attitude control depends on the attitude sensors. Table 10-17 summarizes \nwhat present sensors can do. Each sensor class is available iIi either a 1- or 2-axis \nversion. Magnetometers, Earth sensors, and Sun sensors are available in forms which \nuse the spin motion of a spinning spacecraft to scan the sensor's field of view. Some \nmagnetometers and Earth and Sun sensors do not require scanning, but some highly \naccurate Earth sensors use scanning detectors. Magnetometers apply only to altitudes \nbelow about 6,000 km because the Earth's magnetic field falls off rapidly with alti-\ntude. Uncertainty in the Earth's magnetic field and its variability with time limits the \naccuracy of a magnetometer. In the same way, horizon uncertainty limits an Earth \nsensor's accuracy. Star sensors, however, allow us to measure attitude very accurately. \nMost star sensors are too slow (typically several seconds) to control a spacecraft's \nattitude directly, so we nonna1Iy use them with gyroscopes for high accuracy and rapid \nresponse. Gyroscope accuracy is limited by instrument drift, so most gyroscope sys-\ntems are used in conjunction with an absolute reference such as a star sensor or a \ndirectional antenna. \n\nAfter-the-fact processing can improve our knowledge of attitude. For example, we \ncan monitor the Earth's magnetic field continuously and therefore partially correct the \nvariable effects of magnetic sensing. Variations in the Earth's horizon tend to follow \na daily cycle, so we can apply some filtering correction. \n\n\n\n322 Spacecraft Design and Sizing ID.4 \n\nTABLE 111-17. Ranges of Sensor Accuracy.

Control systems that \nuse thrusters alone require a dead zone to avoid continuous firing of the thrusters. The \ncontrol system's accuracy is limited to half the dead-zone value plus the sensor \naccuracy. Systems which use wheels (either speed-controlled reaction wheels or \ngimballed constant-speed wheels) can avoid dead-zone attitude errors, so they usually \ncan operate close to the sensor accuracy. \n\nTorquing methods for 3-axis-controlled\"spacecraft include gravity gradient, mag-\nnetic, thrusters, and wheels. Spacecraft using gravity-gradient and magnetic torquing \nare clean and simple but do not provide high levels of control torque. We use thrusters \non most spacecraft because they produce large tOrque and can control the spacecraft's \ntranslational velocity as well as attitude. If the spacecraft must maneuver or suffers \ncyclical disturbances, such as those at orbit rate or twice orbit rate (see Chap. 11), we \nneed to use wheels. A wheel can cyclically speed up or slow down, thus producing \nmaneuvering torque or counteracting disturbance torques. A wheel system consum~ \nless propellant than a thruster-only system because periodic effects do not require \npropellant use. On the other hand, wheel systems are heavier and more complex than \nthose without wheels. Variable-speed reaction wheels produce only limited control \ntorque (less than IN\u00b7 m). To obtain large values of cyclic torque, we use control \nmoment gyros-constant~speed wheels gimballed about an axis perpendicular to the \nspin axis. These gyros can develop torques up to several thousand N \u2022 m. When we need \nmore degrees of freedom or better pointing accuracy, we use mechanisms to point \nspacecraft appendages, such as solar arrays or directional antennas. \n\nEstimating Torque Requirements \n\nOne important sizing parameter for the control subsystem is\u00b7 its torque capability. \nThis capability, often called the control authority, must be large enough to counter-\nbalance disturbance torques and control the attitude during maneuvers and following \ntransient events such as spacecraft separation, deployment, and failure recovery. \nThese latter events usually size the torque requirement The separation transient is \n~y specified in terms of tip-off rate-the angular velocity, typically 0.1 to 1 deg/s, \nunparted to the spacecraft at release from the booster. We size the attitude control \nthrusters to capture or stabilize the spacecraft attitude before it has exceeded a speci-\n\nT 10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 323 \ntied value, as shown in Fig. 10-2A. The relation between required torque T. the tip-off \nrate, {J)t (in radls), spacecraft moment of inertia, Is, and the maximum attitude excur-\nsion, 8max (in rad), is: \n\n(10-1) \n\nThe torquing ability of a thruster system, a reaction wheel, a control moment gyrop or \na pointing mechanism may be set by an acceleration requirement such as that arising \nfrom an attitude slew maneuver, shown in Fig 10-2B. The torque is simply Ia where I \nis the moment of inertia and a is the acceleration. Sometimes the attitude maneuver is \nspecified as a change in angle of 8 in a time tdur. The torque in this case is: \n\nT = 4811 tdur2 (10-2) \nAs Fig. 10-2B shows, this is based on applying full accelerating torque for tdurl2 and \nfull decelerating torque for the remaining time. \n\nAttitude \n\n6 'r9 \nAJigleiC \n\n~.\"'_m, -\nTlma \n\nA.

EstImating Torque for Attitude Capture and Maneuvering. \n\nThe control torque required to stabilize a spacecraft during velocity-correction \nfning of a rocket motor is the product of the rocket's thrust level and the distance that \nits \"line-of-action is offset from the spacecraft center-of-mass. This torque can be due \neither to thruster misalignment or cg offset (see Table 10-18). \n\nEstimating Angular Impulse for 3-Axis Control \nAnother major sizing parameter for the attitude control subsystem is the angular \n\nimpulse capability of its torquers. Angular impulse is the time integral of torque. For \nthruster-produced torque, the angular impulse is related to the propellant mass ex-\npended. For reaction wheels and control moment gyros, the angular impulse is related \nto wheel moment of inertia and speed. In all cases, angular impulse is related to control \nsystem weight. \n\nFor 3-axis control systems, we calculate angular impulse by evaluating that needed \nfor attitude maneuvering, for counteracting the effects of disturbance torques, and for \noscillation or limit cycling. We determine the angular impulse required for man-\neuvering from spacecraft moment of inertia and maneuver angular rate. The angular \nimpulse required to start an attitude maneuver LstaTt is: \n\n(10-3) \n\nWhere Is is spacecraft moment of inertia and {J)man is the angular rate (radls) of the \n\n\n\n324 Spaeecraft Design and Sizing 1D.4 \n\nTABLE 10-18.

Stopping the maneuver requires an equal amount of angular impulse of \nopposite polarity. \n\nTo compute angular impulse to cancel disturbance torques, we examine the \ndisturbances affecting the spacecraft as shown in Table 10-18. These disturbance \ntorques are all vector quantities. They can be expressed in any convenient system of \ncoordinates, although spacecraft body coordinates are generally used. For a given \nspacecraft configuration, orbit, and spacecraft attitude, these torques can be computed \nand integrated over the spacecraft lifetime. The result is the accumulated angular \nimpulse which. if uncontrolled, will disturb the spacecraft attitude. The control sub-\nsystem must counteract these disturbance torques by applying control torque and the \ncontrol subsystem angular impulse capability must be at least equal to the disturbance \nangular impulse. \n\nIn addition to the disturbance torques listed in Table 10-18, the control system may \nbe sized by the requirement to interchange momentum between spacecraft body axes \n(sometimes referred to as Euler cross-coupling torque). Numerically this torque-like \neffect is: \n\n(10-4) \n\n10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 325 \n\nand comes about when the spacecraft dynamic equations are written in rotating \ncoordinates. T E is the torque, g is the angular velocity of the coordinate system, and \nlis is the spacecraft angular mom~tum including th~t due to ~Y rotation ~d \ninternal moving parts (such as reaction wheels). For a crrcular orbIt and the dynamIC \nequations written in a coordinate system whi.ch rota~ at orbit rate, the Euler cross-\ncoupling torques are of the same form as graVIty-gradIent torques and.these effects are \noften combined. \n\nNote that, for any single axis, the disturbance torque may have cyclic terms that \nintegrate to zero over an integer number o~ cycles and secu~ ~ tha! are not \nperiodic. Also note that angular impulse required for maneuvermg IS all cyclic. Reac-\ntion wheels and control moment gyros can counteract cyclic torques by changing \nspeed or direction. If we use reaction wheels or control moment gyros .(CMGs), we can \nsize them for the cyclic terms and counteract only the secular terms WIth thrusters. But \nif we are designing a system that has no wheels or CMGs, we must expel propellant to \ncounteract all disturbances, and the angular impulse requirement is the sum of ~e time \niDtegrals of the absolute value of disturbance ~orque compute? about each axIS. The \nprocess of computing control system an~ar Impul~e from disturbance torques and \nidentifying cyclic and secular components IS shown 10 Table 10-19. \n\nThruster control systems operate by pulsing a thruster when the attitu~e error \nexceeds a set value known as the dead-zone limit. The thruster's design determ10es the \nlength of the pulse-typically from 0.02 sec to 0.1 sec. The propellant consump~on of \nsuch a system is proportional to the size of. ~e pulses and the rate of ~ulse firing. A \nwell designed control system will fire a m10lmum length pulse each time th~ ~ead\u00ad\nzone liIl\\it is exceeded. The angular velocity change, A(f), produced by a mmtmum \npulse P min is: \n\n(10-5) \n\nwhere P . = T st\u00b7 , T is thrust level of the thruster, s is the lever arm through \nwhich th:\" thruster w~ks to produce torque, tmin is the minimum thruster firing time, \nand I is the spacecraft's moment of inertia. The mean angular velocity of the space-\ncraft ~hile in the dead-zone is A(f)/2 which implies that the spacecriUt transverses \na dead-zone of 2ed in 4ed l A(f) seconds. Since the pulse firin~ time is negligib~e rel-\native to the time spent in traversing the dead-zone, the average Impulse rate, IR, IS one \nminimum pulse every 4ed l A(f) seconds, or: \n\nIR=p2minl(46dls) (10-6) \n\nThe total angular impulse expended during the mission, L\"\" is IR times mission \nduration: \n\nL\", = IR * mission duration (10-7) \nThe torque produced by a thruster is equal to its thrust T times its lever anD s. The \n\ntime integral of thrust is linear impulse and is related to the mass of propellant used by \nthe rocket equation (Eq. 17-6). An appropriate expression relating angular impulse to \npropellant use is: \n\nL=sJ Tdt=.s lspgmp (10-8a) \n\nor equivalently: \n\n(10-8b) \n\n\n\n326 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.4 \n\nTABLE 10-19.

Its angular impulse \ncapability is equal to its moment of inertia times its maximum speed-its total angular \nmomentum. A control moment gyro produces torque by changing the direction of its \nconstant-speed momentum wheel. The angular impulse capability of a CMG is its \nmomentum (wheel mass moment of inertia times speed) times the angle through which \nit can be moved. The relation between momentum and weight and power for wheels \nand CMOs is presented in Table 10-20. \n\nEstimating Angular Impulse for Spin Stabilization \n\nFor a spin-stabilized spacecraft, angular impulse is required for spinup, spin main-\ntenance, and spin-axis precession. If the spacecraft is spin-stabilized for only part of \nits mission (such as during kick-stage thrusting), then impulse is also needed for \ndespin. \n\nr 10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 327 \nTABLE 10-20; Weight and Power of Components In an Attitude Determination and Control \n\nSubsystem.

Typical values of spin \nspeed range from 0.1 radls for spacecraft requiring minimal spin stability to 10 radls \nfor stabilization during kick motor firing. Impulse required for despin is computed \nwith this same equation. Note that the inertia of the spacecraft during despin may be \ndifferent than during spinup. \n\nThe principal merit of spin stabilization is that it is passive; that is, a spin-stabilized \nspacecraft will remain spinning at constant rate with its spin axis substantially fixed in \ninertial space. However, if the spacecraft has a thrusting mode such as kick-stage firing \nor thruster firing for velocity correction, both the spin speed and the spin axis orienta-\ntion may be changed. Disturbance torques as presented in Table 10-18 may also make \nspin corrections necessary. \n\nVariation in spin speed occurs when the thruster's axis and spacecraft center of \nmass are misaligned. If the offset between center of mass and the thrust axis is Lcm, the \nangular impulse, MI, imparted by a velocity correction AV to a spacecraft of mass mslc \nis: \n\nMI=ms/cAVLcm (10-10) \n\nIf the offset is in the direction that changes the spin speed. then impulse will be \nrequired to correct spin speed. If the offset is along the spin axis, the spacecraft \nangular-momentum vector will precess, thus changing the orientation of the spin axis. \nIn either event, impulse is required to correct the unwanted change. If spin-speed \ncorrection is required, the impulse is about the spin axis and if precession is involved, \nit is normal to the spin axis. Typical thruster alignment tolerance is 0.1 deg. TIris \ntolerance,coupled with center of mass uncertainty, leads to typical thrust-axis to \ncenter-of-mass offset of 0.OO2s-O.0ls where s is the distance from the thruster to the \ncenter of mass. \n\n\n\n328 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.4 \n\nTo change the direction of spin-axis orientation. we must precess the angular-\nmom~ntwn.vector. This is usually done by ~yJichronizing off-axis thruster pulses with \nthe SpIn penod of the spacecraft. The small Increments of angular impulse imparted by \nproperly synchronized firings add at 90 deg to the momentum vector to rotate the \nvector ~ti?n. Some. nutation is ~so introduced by the thruster firings but this \ndecays WIth time. The Impulse reqwred to precess a spinning spacecraft through an \nangle of a radians is \n\nLprecess = IssDs a (IO-H) \nwhere Iss is ~e mass moment of inertia abo~t the spin axis, Ds is the spin speed (in \nradls) and a IS the angle of rotation of the SPIn vector in radians. \n\nThe total angular impulse is converted to propellant weight through the use of \n~. (1.0-10). Typical wei~t and p<?wer for attitude control components are summa-\nrized In Table 10-20 and discussed In Sec. 11.1. Actuators and wheels are available in \na large number of sizes and capabilities. Their weight and power as a function of \ntorque may be estimated by the relations given. \n\n10.4.3 Communications Subsystem \n\nThe communications subsystem receives and demodulates uplink signals and \nmodulates and transmits dOWlllink signals. The subsystem also allows us to track \nspacecraft by retransmitting received range tones or by providing coherence between \nrece.ived and transmitted signals, so we can measure Doppler shift. Table 10-21 sum-\nmanzes the main system considerations which drive the design of communications \nsubsystems. \n\nTABLE 10-21. System Considerations for Design of Communications Subsystems. \n\nConsideration Implication \n\nAccess Ability to communicate with the spacecraft requires clear field of view \nto the receiving antenna and appropriate antenna gain \n\nFrequency Selection based on bands approved for spacecraft use by Intemational \nagreement Standard bands are S (2 GHz). X (8 GHz). and Ku (12 GHz) \n\nBaseband Data Data bandwidth and allowable error rate determine RF power level \nCharacteristics for communications \n\nCommunication access to a spacecraft requires a clear field of view for the \nspacecraft antenna. It also requires sufficient received power to detect the signal with \nacceptable error rate. Access across many viewing angles demands an antenna with a \nwide ~wi~th, so good spacecraft d~igns always include an antenna system that \ncan receIve SIgnalS over at least a hemIsphere. The gain of a widebeam antenna is \nlow-typically 0 dB for hemispheric coverage. Therefore, we must select a level of \ntransmit power and a receiver sensitivity that allow us to detect signals with an \nacceptable error rate. \n\nThe spacecraft receives data consisting of commands and range tones. Command \nrates range from 100 bits/s to 100 kbits/s, with most systems below 1,000 bits/so The \ndata ~ depen~ on mi~on consid~tions and sets the communications subsystem's \nbandWIdth, which establishes the receIved power required to detect signals (Chap. 13). \n\nT 10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 329 \nFor spacecraft communicating directly with ground ~a1s',received .siptal strength \nis not a design driver because we can set the ground terminal s tranSmItting power as \nhigh as necessary. However, received signal strength from a relay satellite does affect \nthe communications subsystem's receiver sensitivity and maximum data rate. Systems \nthat require data communications at rates greater than 1,000 bits/s normaIly use bigh-\ngain, directional antennas and can operate at low bit rates to allow wide-angle access \nwhen needed. \n\nThe downlink signal consists of range tones, telemetry for spacecraft status, and \npayload data. The baseband data is normally digital and multiplexed by frequency or \ntime. Telemetry to report the spacecraft's status operates between 100 bits/s and \n1 000 bits/so If the downlink handles only status telemetry, or if the payload data will \nfit within a low-bandwidth link, we can communicate using a widebeam antenna. Data \ncommunication over a high bandwidth usually requires a high-gain, directional an-\ntenna and a low-bandwidth mode for widebeam coverage. \n\nTable 10-22 shows how we size the communications subsystem. To do sO,we must \nidentify the data bandwidths of the uplink and. downlink, select communicati?n \nfrequencies, prepare RF power budgets for both links (Chap. 13), and select ~wp\u00ad\nment. The basic communications subsystem consists of a transmitter, a receIver, a \nwidebeam antenna, and an RF diplexer. We may also use a high-power transmitter or \na directional antenna if the data rate requires it. \n\nTABLE 10-22.

The transponder provides a coherent carrier response to measure range rates \nand retransmits ranging tones. Section 11.2 describes other equipment in com-\nmunications subsystems, including transmitters with higher power and directional \nantennas. \n\nTABLE 10-23.

We usually handle housekeeping \ndata intennittently and at rates below 1,000 bits/so Rates for payload commanding and \ntelemetry depend on the payload's design. They may require very high data rates \n(10 kb/s to 500 Mb/s) and storage of payload data. \n\nThe C&DH subsystem may include encryptors, decryptors, a sequencer or timer, a \ncomputer for data processing, and equipment for data storage. It interfaces with the \ncommunications subsystem from which it receives commands and to which it sends \nthe formatted telemetry stream. It also delivers commands to and receives telemetry \nfrom the other spacecraft subsystems and may have similar interfaces with the \npayload. \n\nThe decoding of command signals is peculiar to the detailed design of the system. \nA typical command is a serial binary word containing a preamble, a user address, and \nthe command word. The preamble allows the spacecraft to identify and authenticate \nthe command. The command unit decodes the user addresses and then routes actual \ncommands to the correct users, either by separate wires or by a data bus. Each user then \ndecodes and executes the command \n\nIn some cases, we need several commands to do something. If the function is time \ncritical, we can send precursor commands and verify their receipt before sending a \nprecisely timed execute or a time-tagged execute. A sequencer or onboard computer \ncan execute time-tagged commands. If we need to send commands over time, we can \ntime-tag them or use a timer-execute command followed by a sequence of timer-reset \ncommands. If the command system fails, the command halts when the timer times out \nOrdnance normally requires separate arm and fire commands. \n\nTelemetry signals tell us about the spacecraft's health and Provide operational data \nneeded to control the spacecraft. Normally, we convert telemetry measurements to \ndigital signals, serially multiplex them in a telemetry frame using a repetitive pattern, \nand transmit the frame using a main frame word for frame synchronization. We may \nuse a main frame word as a subcommutated channel or we may supercommutate \nsignals if we need a sampling rate higher than the frame rate. Fmally, we may place \nthe telemetry frames in packets and multiplex them with other downlink data. \n\nCommands and telemetry signals depend on the spacecraft's operation. Each of the \nspacecraft's commandable functions needs a separate command. In addition, we must \nprovide enough telemetry to define the spacecraft's state of health, as well as data for \noperational control. \n\nTable 10-24 lists the steps to size the C&DH subsystem. In its simplest form. this \nsubsystem consists of a command decoder and a telemetry multiplexer. More com-\nplex systems distribute the command decoding function by routing serial commands \nto user subsystems for final decoding. Telemetry multiplexing can also be distributed. \nHigh-performance subsystems use central digital computers for \u00b7data processing. \nTable 10-25 presents typical characteristics. Chapter 11 describes more complex \nsubsystems. \n\n10.4.5 Thermal Subsystem \n\nThe thermal design of a spacecraft involves identifying the sources of heat and \ndesigning paths for transporting and rejecting heat, so components will stay within \n\n10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 331 \n\nTABLE 10-24.

The sources of heat include solar radiation, Earth-reflection \nand infrared radiation, and electrical energy dissipated in the electrical compone~ts. \nConventional electronics operate at temperatures close to room temperature ~25 C) \nand will tolerate temperature variations of about \u00b120 DC. Battery cells, part;icularly \nnickel-cadmium cells are more sensitive to temperature than most electromcs. But \nthey can still stand te~perature ranges of 5 DC to 20 DC. W,e can .contro! the te~pera\u00ad\ntures of compartments for conventional electronics by coating or insulating theIr outer \nsurfaces. We select these coatings to strike a balance between the heat absorbed and \nthe heat radiated to space. The coatings include v:moW;; paints an? tapes, and second \nsurface glass mirrors. The weight of such coatings IS almost mdepende~t of the \nquantity of heat dissipated and seldom exceeds 4% of the spacecraft dry. weIght The \nthermal coatings, particularly insulation, can. close. o~t compartment opemngs and may \nalso shield components from electromagnetic radiation. . .. . \n\nComponents which have stringent temperature repnrements or which diSSIpate \nlarge amounts of electrical power require more extensIve thermal control. For exam-\nple, we usually place gyros and precision oscillators in insulated comp~ents, or \novens, with active electrical heaters to control temperatures carefully. T~ve~~ w~ve \ntubes and other elements which dissipate a lot of power concentrate thelT diSSIpation \nlocally and produce hot spots. Normally, we conduct heat away from such hot spots \n\n\n\n332 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.4 \n\nand spread it over a thermal panel where it radiates to space. If the hot spots are less \nthan 50 W, we can simply increase the thickness of the mounting panel so it will carry \nthe heat away. But more intense hot spots and equipment that must meet tight thermal \nlimits usually require heat pipes to move the heat and thus equalize temperatures. \n\nThe process of thermal design for spacecraft proceeds as follows. The first step is \nto identify heat sources and the location of radiating panels to dispose of excess heat \nThe heat sources include internal dissipation and external radiation from the Sun and \nthe Earth. Often, particular surfaces of the spacecraft are not exposed or only partially \nexposed to the Sun or Earth. These faces are preferred locations for radiating panels \n,and for components which dissipate large amounts of heat. The latter should be next \nto the radiators. We can compute the total amount of radiating area from the static-\nheat-balance equation for the entire spacecraft. But a component's thermal perfor-\nmance.may differ markedly from the average. \n\nMost power for thermal control goes to heaters that keep components from getting \ntoo cold. Heaters also compensate for imperfections in insulation or heat leaks, and are \nused to heat areas such as articulation joints that are difficult to insulate and dissipate \nlittle heat internally. Heaters or heater-controlled heat pipes (see Sec. 11.5) offer very \ntight control or control at a particular temperature value for certain components. A \ntypical medium-sized spacecraft (1,000 W) consumes 20 W in the thermal subsystem \nplus any power required for special thermal control. In most cases, heaters can operate \nfrom primary power. \n\n10.4.6 Power Subsystem \n\nThe power subsystem generates power, conditions and regulates it, stores it for \nperiods of peak demand or eclipse operation, and distnbutes it throughout the space-\ncraft. The power subsystem may also need to convert and regulate voltage levels or \nsupply multiple voltage levels. It frequently switches equipment on or off and, for \nincreased reliability, protects against short circuits and isolates faults. Subsystem \ndesign is also influenced by space radiation, which degrades the performance of solar \ncells. Finally, battery life often limits the spacecraft's lifetime. \n\nEarlier in this chapter, I described how to prepare a power budget for the spacecraft. \nThis budget includes most of the information we need to size the power subsystem: the \nspacecraft's needs for operating power, storage requirements, and how the power \nsubsystem degrades over the spacecraft's lifetime. The remaining steps to size the \npower subsystem are selecting a solar-array approach, sizing the array, sizing the \nbatteries and the components that control charging, and sizing the equipment for \ndistributing and converting power. \n\nSolar arrays are generally planar, cylindrical, or omnidirectional. Planar arrays are \nflat panels pointed toward the Sun. Their power output is proportional to the projection \nof their area toward the incident sunlight. Three-axis-stabilized spacecraft normally \nuse planar arrays. Cylindrical arrays appear on spin-stabilized systems in which the \nspin axis is perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the Sun line. The output of a solar-\ncell array is nearly proportional to the amount of solar energy intercepted, and the \nprojected area of a cylinder is lin times the total area. Thus, the cylindrical array \nshould have approximately n times as many cells as a planar array with the same \npower rating. But temperature effects slightly favor the cylindrical array, so the actual \nratio is closer to la.5. If the spacecraft can receive sunlight from any aspect, then its \narray must have equal projected area in all directions. In other words, it must have an \nomnidirectional array. A sphere has this property, but paddles or cylinders combined \n\nT 10.4 Designing the Spacecraft Bus 333 \nwith planar panels are also possible. The total area of an omnidirectional array must \nbe approximately 4 times the projected area, so an omnidirectional array has about \n4 times the area of a planar array with the same power rating. \n\nThe required area of a planar solar array is related to the required power, P, the solar \nconstant (1,367 W/m2), and the conversion efficiency of the solar-cell system. \nAlthough cells have had efficiencies as high as 30%, practical array designs range \nfrom 5% to 15% when taking into account the operating conditions and degradation at \nend-of-life. An array with an efficiency of 7% would have a required area of \n\n-_P_- = O.OIP \n0.07 x 1367 \n\n(10-12) \n\nwhere Aa is in m2 and P is in watts. This area is characteristic of current arrays. The \nmass of a planar array with specific performance of 25 W /kg is . \n\nMa = 0.04 P (10-13) \nwhere Ma is in kg and P in watts. Current designs range from 14 to 47 W/kg at \nend-of-life. The high end would provide 66 W/kg at beginning-of-life. Solar arrays \nmounted on the spacecraft's body usually weigh less than planar arrays. \n\nRechargeable nickel-cadmium or nickel-hydrogen batteries are the usual devices \nfor energy storage for unmanned spacecraft. They are available in various sizes and \nare highly reliable even though their performance characteristics are quite complex. \nThe battery often represents one of the most massive components in the spacecraft. It \nalso is very sensitive to temperature and to the use proflle. Nickel-cadmium, and to a \nlesser extent nickel-hydrogen batteries perform best when operated between 5 \u00b0c and \n20 \u00b0 C. This range is both lower and more restricted than the temperature requirements \nfor most electronic components. The battery also has complex wear-out mechanisms, \nthus limiting cycle life as a function of depth-of-discharge. Other variables-temper-\nature, rate of charge, rate of discharge, and degree of overcharge-also affect cycle life \nbut in a less well-defined way. If a battery has shallow discharge cycles, itloses capac-\nity. To counter this tendency, most spacecraft recondition their batteries from time to \ntime by discharging them completely. \n\nWe determine a battery's capacity from the energy it must produce (discharge \npower times discharge duration) and from its depth-of-discharge. We select.the \nbattery's depth-of-discharge to meet cycle life requirements. Table 10-26 gives guide-\nlines on depths-of-discharge for nickel-cadmium and nickel-hydrogen batteries. \nSection 11.4 discusses these concepts in more detail. \n\nTABLE 10-26.

We must also consider safety issues, but RTG sources are \nprobably safer than most propellants. The design must ensure that the generator \nremains intact and shielded even during catastrophic launch failure. \n\nUsing rotating machines to generate primary power is another design with \npotential. Closed-cycle, thermal engines should be nearly twice as efficient as solar \ncells, and rotating generators can provide sine-wave AC power with better regulation \nthan solar-cell designs. \n\n10.4.7 Structures and Mechanisms \n\nThe spacecraft structure carries and protects the spacecraft and payload equipment \nthrough the launch environment and deploys the spacecraft after orbit injection. The \nload-carrying structure of a spacecraft is primary structure, whereas brackets, closoout \npanels, and most deployable components are secondary structure. \n\nWe size primary structure based on the launch loads, with strength and stiffness \ndominating its design. The size of secondary structure depends on on-orbit factors \nrather than boost-phase loads. Secondary structure only has to survive but not function \nduring boost, and we can usually cage and protect deployables throughout this phase. \n\nEach of the launch boosters provides maximum acceleration levels to be used f()r \ndesign (see Chap. 18). These acceleration levels or load factors are typically 6 g's \nmaximum axial acceleration and 3 g's maximum lateral acceleration. These levels \nwork for conceptual design, but some designers prefer to increase them by as much as \n50% during early design phases. During preliminary sizing, we must remember that \nthe primary structure must carry some weight, such as kick motors and propellant, \nwhich will drop away before orbit injection. Section 11.6 discusses structural design \nand presents methods for preliminary structural sizing. \n\nWe use cylindrical and conical shell structures and trusses for primary structure, \ncommonly building them out of aluminum and magnesium with titanium for end \nfittings and high-strength attachments. Composite materials have seen limited use in \nprimary structure to date but they will become more common. We can size primary \nstructure by modeling it as a cylindrical beam which is mass loaded by its own weigbt \nand the spacecraft's components. The lateral load factors applied\u00b7 to this beam produce \na moment that is a function of axial location. Compression in the extreme section ()f \nthe beam carries the moment. By adding the axial load to the moment-induced, \ncompressive .load, we can estimate the critical load, which in tum sizes the primary \nstructure (see Eq. 11-42). In these preliminary sizing calculations, we can exercise \nmuch license in assuming symmetry and in simplifying the loads. We can iterate the \nskin gage to withstand stress levels and check the tubular design for buckling (see \nSec. 11.6.6). \n\nWe use a similar approach to size a truss-based primary structure. We reduce the \ntruss to its simplest form by successively removing redundant members until we reach \na statically determinant structure. Simply combining loading conditions allows us to \nsize the truss members. \n\nWe must also locate and mount components on the basic, load-carrying cylinder or \ntruss. Most electronic components have rectangular symmetry and are mounted with \nlugs or bosses integral to their housings. Mounting requirements include loads, good \nthermal contact with the mounting surface, and good electrical contact. Aluminum \nhoneycomb is an excellent mount for components. It attaches to longeron-stringer \nframes to fonn a semi-monocoque Ooad-carrying skin) structure. Honeycomb sheets \nwith composite faces occasionally substitute for other approaches. \n\n\n\n336 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.5 \n\nSome components are not rectangular. For example, propellant tanks are normally \nspherical but may be elongated, have conical sections, or be toroidal. Electromechan-\nical drives and reaction wheels are cylindrical, and control moment gyros are complex. \nThese components include mounting provisions in their designs. Generally they have \nflanges, bosses, or lUgs. In most cases, and particularly in the case of tanks and pres_ \nsure vessels, the mounting must avoid loading the component To do so, the mount \nmust be statically determinant, and component loads from deflection of the mount \nmust be minimal. \n\nOther components of complex geometric shape, such as thrusters and connectors, \nmay mount through brackets specifically tailored to them. Hinges and similar items are \nmachined fittings with integral flanges or mounting bosses. We can align components \nby shimming, but we must be careful not to disturb thermal and electrical bonds. \n\nA set of data on spacecraft subsystem mass is presented in Appendix A. These data \nshow the structural mass to be approximately 20% of the spacecraft total. However \nthese data do not include all of the injected mass (apogee kick motors carried in the \nspacecraft are not included). Therefore one should be careful about using these data \nfor estimating new designs. However, structural mass of 10% to 20% of spacecraft dry \nmass is a reasonable starting point \n\nWe must have an interstage structure to mount the spacecraft to the booster. This \nstructure conforms to the booster provisions for mounting and carries loads during .the \nboost phase. Both truss structures and conical adapters are common. Because this \nstructure is designed for strength under high loads, it is an excellent candidate for \nhigh-strength materials and weight-efficient design. The spacecraft usually provides \nthis interstage structure and incorporates a separation joint to release the spacecraft at \norbit \n\nCommon methods of attachment at the separation plane are marmon clamps or \nseparation bolts. In the marmon clamp, the separation joint is a continuous ring held \ntogether by an annular clamp. Release of clamp tension allows the joint to separate. In \nthe case of separation bolts, the joint is held by several bolts which are released by \neither severing the bolt or by releasing a nut. Once the separation joint is free, springs \nimpart a small velocity increment to the spacecraft. After separation, the booster \nmaneuvers to avoid accidental impact For spin-stabilized spacecraft, the interstage \nstructure may incorporate a mechanism to impart spin while ejecting the spacecraft. \n\nThe Shuttle interfaces differently from the expendable boosters. It links with its \npayloads at a series of hard points located along the sill of the cargo bay and along the \ncargo bay's centerline (keel fittings). The payload and its upper stages usually require \na cradle or fittings to translate the loads into these hard points. Mechanisms for deploy-\ning the spacecraft may be spring-powered or motor-driven. Chapter 11 presents \nweight-estimating relations for motor-driven mechanisms. Spring-powered mecha-\nnisms must meet stiffness requirements, but they weigh about half as much as their \nmotor-driven equivalents. \n\n10.5 Integrating the Spacecraft Design \n\n10.5.1 Spacecraft Size \n\nIf we know the spacecraft's weight and power, we can estimate its size. Most space-\ncraft have a main body or equipment compartment Many also have solar panels which \nwrap around the compartment for launch and deploy outside the compartment on orbit. \n\nT 10.5 Integrating the Spacecraft Design 337 \nTable 10-28 gives estimating relations based on analysis of the volume and dimen-\nsions of a number of spacecraft. These spacecraft ranged from 135 kg to 3,625 kg and \nrepresent about 15% of the U.S. spacecraft launched' between 1978 and 1984 [TRW \nDefense and Space Systems Group, 1980-1985]. Their density ranged from 20 kg/m3 \nto 172 kg/m3, with an average of 79 kg/m3\u2022 The spacecraft w~ all CYlindri~y \nymmetric although the cross section varied from rectangular to ctrCular. The ratio of \n~ase diam~ter to cube root of mass ranged from 0.16 m/kg1/3 to 0.31 m/kg1/3, with an \naverage of 0.23 m/kgl/3. The ratio of spacecraft height to cube root of mass ranged \nfrom 0.13 to 0.83, with an average of 0.39 m/kg1/3. \n\nTABLE 10-28.

Some-\ntimes, the required array area is smaller than the ~pacecraft's body area, and the body \ncan be oriented properly relative to the Sun. In this case, we can mount the solar cells \ndirectly on the body. But high-power spacecraft usually mo~t the solar ~lls on \nexternal panels either off to one side or symmetrically on both Sides of the eqwpment \ncompartment. External solar arrays greatly increase the spacecraft's moment of \ninertia, particularly about the axes perpendicular ~o the array axis. Suppose the solar \narray consists of two square panels, one on each Side of the spacecraft, an~ the cen~r \nof each ()f these panels is La meters from the body's ce~ter. If so, the m~ m \nmoment of inertia is approximately La2Ma, where Ma IS the solar array weight \nTable 10-29 gives an approximate expressi~n for La in ~ ~fthe ~y area and the \nbody dimension, s. It shows the solar array s moment of mertia relative to the space-\ncraft's center. External solar arrays also affect the total projected spacecraft area, \nwhich in turn influences aerodynamic drag and solar-radiation pressure. Table 10-29 \nsummarizes estimating rules for solar-array moment of inertia and area offset Aa is the \ntotal solar array area. We must add these inertias to the inertias of the central compart-\nment, assuming the latter to be equal to the values for the folded spacecraft computed \nabove. \n\nTABLE 10-29.

We should consider its \npotential effect on spacecraft sizing during conceptual design by examining failures \nfrom wear-out and random causes. In other words, we should identify the ways in \nwhich the spacecraft may fail and tailor the design to eIiminate or limit failures to \nacceptable levels. This implies identifying components or functions which can wear \nout and designing the system so that they meet the mission's lifetime requirements. \nPropellant supply and battery-cycle life are examples of these components. If equip-\nment does not wear out, we must evaluate how each part's failure affects the mission \nand modify the design to eliminate any single-point failures. Then, we use statistics to \ncompute the probability of mission success and tailor the design to acceptable levels. \nThis process is not exact, but careful attention to reliability gives us the most balanced \nand able system possible. \n\nTo design for reliability, we must understand what constitutes success. The more \nspecifically and numerically we can state the success criteria, the easier we can trans-\nlate these criteria into design requirements. After defining success, we should list the \nsmallest amount of equipment or number of functions that will provide it. We can \nbegin by placing these functions in a signal flow or block diagram. In this basic form, \n~ost functions involve only one path or set of equipment. For this reason, we some-\ntim~ call it a single-string reliability model. Later in the design process, we can add \nmultiple paths or backup modes to improve the probability of success, taking care to \nunderstand both the reliability enhancement and the cost. \n\nBy understanding the functions needed for a successful mission, we understand the \nfactors which limit mission life or threaten that success. Often a new mission depends \non developing or exploiting new technology, so we need to know the technology and \nthe factors that stress the components of our system. By reducing our knowledge to a \nset of specifications and applying the stresses to our design, we improve our ability to \nproduce reliable hardware. \n\nOne of the key steps in design for reliability is to numerically predict the probability \nof success. To do so, we must differentiate failures from wear-out and failures from \nrandom causes. Classic reliability models depict the rate of failure when plotted \nagainst time as a \"bathtub\" -shaped curve. Early on, systems fail at high rates because \nof infant monality; late in life, they fail because of wear-out. We can eliminate failures \nfrom infant mortality with careful construction, testing, and bum-in. We can avoid \nwear-out by understanding and eIiminating the factors that cause it or by providing \nenough hardware to replace worn-out equipment. Between the extremes of infant \nmortality and wear-out, the failure rate is more or less uniform and attributed to \nrandom effects. \n\nWear-out shortens a mission. Random failures kill a spacecraft with accumulated \neffects. A successful design copes with them by providing enough backup components \nto cover them. Because we cannot determine when they will occur, our design must \nallow us to detect and correct them. Also, a good design tolerates some failures and \nremains useful in a degraded mode. \n\nSearching for and identifying the ways in which equipment can fail is a basic part \nof desi~ for reliability. This process, called Failure Modes Effects and Criticality \nAnalyszs (FMECA) assumes that we can identify the ways in which equipment can fail \n~d analyze the effect. Key to this process is identifying and eIiminating single-point \nfailure modes--failures that by themselves can kill the mission. If we cannot eliminate \nthem, we must control their probability of occurrence. \n\n10.6 Examples 339 \n\nWe can analyze the failure modes of our equipment in several ways. For example, \nthe all-part method simply analyzes each of the spacecraft's parts to determine the \neffect of its failure. On a large spacecraft this method is a lot of work but is straight-\nforward and easy to do. The all-~art melh;od requires us t? an.alyze shorts and opens \n_systematically searching for wtreS or pnnted traces on cm:wt boards that can cause \nfailure if opened or shorted together. We can ~so use scenarios to find potential ~ailure \nmodes. To do so, we simulate the spacecraft s launch, deployment, and operation to \nensure that telemetry can detect failures and that th~ command system can. correct \nthem. This simulation normally occurs when operational procedures are bemg pre-\npared. but it can more effectively detect design flaws if done earlier. \n\nAnother way to identify failure modes is the jury method. In many cases. new \ndesigns do not have a lot of experience behind them, but people ha~e had ~xpen~ce \nwith similar equipment. We can poll them as part of a formal design reView or m a \nseparate meeting, thus using their experience to identify likely failure modes and \nprobable effects. \n\n10.6 Examples \n\nIn this section, we discuss three examples of spacecraft sizing. First we develop a \npreliminary estimate of the FJreSat spacecraft and then review two actual systems \n-FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B. \n\nThe drivers for the FJreSat spacecraft design are the Fm:Sat payload design \n(Sec. 9-7, Table 9-15) and the orbit and ~V req~ments (Table 7-3~. We will use \nthese to get a broad estimate of the overall SIZe, weight, and power for FJreSat and then \nto break this down into approximate subsystem allocations. The results of the top-level \nprocess are summarized in Table 10-30. Keep in ~d that these are .crude estimates \nthat allow us to begin the process of spacecraft design. We must continually evaluate \nand refme the requirements and resulting design and perform a variety of system trades \nto arrive at an acceptable, consistent design. \n\nOur first estimate of the spacecraft mass and power come directly from the payl~ \nestimates of Sec. 9-7 (Table 9-15). As given in Table 10-5, the payload mass IS \nbetween 17% and 50% of the spacecraft dry weight with an average of 30% (see also \nAppendix A). We know very little about FJreSat at this time, so we will add margin by \nestimating the payload at 20% of the spacecraft ~, we~ belo,:\"\" ~e a~erage percent-\nage. However, FireSat was scaled down from a flight umt. This IDIplies that the bus \nwill probably be a larger fraction of the spacecraft dry weight: o.ur know!edge of the \nweight is poor at this time because we have not yet done a preliminary weight budget. \nWhen we allocate the mass to subsystems below we will hold the margin at the system \nlevel to allow us to apply it as needed to various subsystems. \n\nSimilarly, our initial power estimate is based on the payload power of 32 W and the \nestimate from Table 10-9 that for moderate size spacecraft, the payload represents \n40% of the spacecraft power. Our spacecraft is small with significant control and \nprocessing requirements. Therefore, we will again be conservative and assume that the \npayload represents only 30% of the power requirement for FireSat Here the knowl-\nedge is very poor, because we have not yet budgeted the power and have not \ndetermined what payload duty cycle should be used-tbat is, should we tum the pay-\nload off over the poles and oceans? Because we will have to contend with eclipses \n(Sec. 5.1, Example I), the solar array output will be estimated at 170 W to provide \n110 W to the spacecraft which then provides 32 W to the payload. \n\n\n\n340 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.6 \n\nTABLE 10-30.

In order to maintain reasonable efficiency, \nwe initially assume a metered bipropellant system with an Isp of 300 s (Sec. 10.4.1, \nChap. 17). Using the rocket equation (Eq. 17-7), we can compute the propellant mass \nas 28 kg and then add small amounts for attitude control and margin as given in \nTable 10-30. Here our knowledge of the propellant mass as a fraction of the spacecraft \nmass is good, although the spacecraft mass itself is not yet well known. Because the \npropellant mass is small, we may choose later to go to a simpler monopropellant \nsystem or to have the launch vehicle put FrreSat directly into its end orbit. \n\nGiven an approximate mass for the whole system we can estimate the size and \nmoments of inertia from Table 10-28. This, in tmn, can tell us something about the \nsolar array configuration. We estimate the body area at 2.0 m2 and the required solar \narray area at 1.7 m2. So we can probably avoid solar panels altogether and use an \nomnidirectional array consisting of solar cells mounted on the non-nadir facing sides \nof the body. This will be compact, economical, and easy to control. . \n\nFmally, Table 10-31 presents two ways of developing a preliminary weight budget \nfor FireSat We can estimate the mass of each subsystem as a percentage of spacecraft \n\n10.6 Examples 341 \n\ndry mass or as a percentage of the payload mass. Column (I) lists the average percent-\nage of spacecraft dry mass devoted tp each subsystem based on the historical data for \nspacecraft listed in Appendix A. The resulting mass distribution and margin are shown \nin column (3). Column (2) lists the same data expressed as the average percentage of \npayload mass devoted to each subsystem. The resulting FrreSat mass distribution is \nshown in column (4). We recommend using the mass'distribution shown in column \n(4). A weight margin of at least 25% at this stage of development is appropriate. The \ncolumn (3) approach resulted in a \"margin\" of only 11.2 kg or 8% of the spacecraft \ndry mass. This approach prematurely divides the available margin among the \nsubsystems. We recommend maintaining the margin at the system level and then allo-\ncating it to the payload or other subsystems as necessary throughout the development \n\nTABLE 10-31.

It interfaced with NASA's GSTDN S-band \nground network. \n\nTable 10-33 presents the key design decisions for configuring the two spacecraft. \nWeight dominated the FLTSATCOM design. The payload was large and complex, \nand mission-reliability goals required complete payload redundancy. The Atlas-\nCentaur's launch capability limited the weight, thus requiring tight weight control. \nBecause the FLTSATCOM payload required over 1,000 W, designers selected an \noriented planar solar array. The Atlas-Centaur's fairing diameter also limited the \nspacecraft's folded size. The spacecraft employs two attitude-control modes: spin \nstabilization for orbit injection and 3-axis stabilization for on-orbit ,control. All \ncommunication components are body-fixed, and the body is controlled to point the \nantennas toward nadir. A planar solar array is articulated about one axis to poin t \ntoward the Sun. Liquid-hydrazine propulsion provides attitude and orbit control; a \nsolid apogee kick motor injected the spacecraft into orbit. \n\nTABLE 10-33.

Uquld hydrazine thrusters used for \nattitude control \n\n\n\n344 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.6 \n\nWeight did not dominate the design for HEAO-B. Its payload instruments existed \nbefore the program developed the spacecraft to cany them. The program was able to \nestablish large weight and power margins. The fairing diameter affected the space-\ncraft's size, but the instruments fit within this diameter. Power requirements were \nmodest and a planar body-fixed array was used. The spacecraft mjssion required \nprecision pointing of the payload, which led to 3-axis attitude control USing \ngyroscopes, star sensors, and reaction wheels. Kick-stage propulsion was not required. \nHydrazine monopropellant propulsion was used for attitude control. \nDerign Budgets \n\nTable 10-34 presents the propellant budget, velocity increments, specific impulse, \nand spacecraft mass for FLTSATCOM. To derive the velocity required to insert the \nspacecraft into its final orbit, the designers used the methods in Chap. 7. That chapter \nalso describes injection-error analysis which the designers used to derive the velocity \nincrement that corrected the orbit The ratio of this error to the AKM velocity (0.5%) \nis typical of current performance for solid motors. The stationkeeping velocity derives \nfrom analysis of orbit perturbations over the spacecraft's design life. The stationkeep-\ning increment developed from an operational requirement to move the spacecraft at a \nrate of 15 deg longitude per day. During orbit injection FLTSATCOM spin-stabilized \nat 60 rpm and maneuvered through an angle of 65 deg while spinning. Eqs. (10-7) and \n(10-9) translate these requirements into propellant weight During its lifetime the \nspacecraft uses propellant for attitude control, mainly to counter solar radiation \npressure. HEAO-B needed propellant only to acquire attitude and to cancel distur-\nbance torques (principally aerodynamics and gravity gradient; see Table 10-18). The \npropellant's mass was 138 kg. \n\nTABLE 10-34.

HEAO-B had two normal power modes: cruise and ground pass. The \ntable shows power requirements for both modes, together with the orbital average. The \nbatteries were sized for 20% depth of discharge because the mission life exceeded \n5,000 discharge cycles. For FLTSATCOM, payload power, including noted power \nconversion losses, is the main entry. The FLTSATCOM battery was large enough to \n\n10.6 Examples 345 \n\nsupport the full operating power during the maximum eclipse of 1.2 hours. The bat-\nteries operated at a maximum depth of discharge of 70% and required a recharge \npower of 167 W. Designers sized the array for a beginning-of-life power of 1,800 W. \n\nTABLE 10-35.

Each subsystem uses liquid-hydrazine propellant stored in two tanks. The \ntanks are pressurized with a fixed amount of nitrogen gas, so the hydrazine pressure \n~ecays as propellant bums. The tanks can cross connect through commandable isola-\ntion valves. Thrusters and propellant plumbing are redundant and able to cross \nconnect. HEAD-B used twelve 4.4-N thrusters mounted in six dual-thruster assem-\nblies. FLTSATCOM uses sixteen 4.4-N thrusters and four O.44-N thrusters mounted \nin dual-thruster assemblies. \n\nTABLE 10-37.

FLTSATCOM employs body-mounted antennas for its \npayload and orients one body face to point the antennas toward nadir. FLTSATCOM \nal~ h~ a planar so~ar array which it orients toward the Sun by combining body \none~tation and rotation o.f the array axis. Fmally, FLTSATCOM has a guidance \nreqwrement for AV corrections. HEAD-B was required to point anywhere except close \nto ~e Sun and hold accurate pointing for long periods. It also had modest power \nreqwrements and no requirement for orbit correction. \n\nTABLE 10-38.

Both space-\ncraft had body-mounted payloads and controlled the body's attitude to point the \npayloads (see Table 10-13). Both spacecraft use one axis of body attitude control to \norient a planar solar array toward the Sun. FLTSATCOM, which requires more than \n1 kW of electric power, orients the array about a second axis. \n\nFL TSA TCOM employs a solid apogee kick motor to inject it into orbit Attitude is \ncontrolled during AKM firing by spin stabilization (see Tables 10-14 and 10-15). The \nspin direction can be rotated by using an off-axis thruster; the thruster fires pulses syn-\nchronized with the spin period. During nonnaI opemtion and A V firing, FL TSATCOM \nis 3-axis stabilized. It uses Earth and Sun sensors for attitude sensing and thrusters and \na reaction wheel for torque. HEAD-B did not have a AV mode. Under nonnaI \noperation, it used gyroscopes and Sun sensors for attitude sensing with wheels and \nthrusters for torque. Its torqued gyroscopes slewed the reference-pointing direction, \nand payload star sensors allowed accurate reference and correction of gyro drift. \nRadiation pressure causes the main disturbance torques for FLTSATCOM. Gravity \ngradient and aerodynamics were the chieftorques for HEAO-B. See Table 10-18 and \nSec.H.I. \n\nTable 10-39 shows weight and power values for components of the complete \nguidance, navigation, and control subsystems (including redundancy) for both \nFLTSATCOM and HEAD-B. \n\nTABLE 10-39 \u2022.

This spacecraft uses only 977 commands for infrequent commanding. The \ntelemetry requirements are 178 mainframe words (05 s frame rate) and fewer than \n1,000 subcommutated words-typical of a minimum subsystem for TT&C. A wide-\nbeam antenna mounted on the tip of the main payload's antenna mast ensures \ncommunications access to the satellite. \n\nThe communications requirements for HEAD-B were driven by HEAO's low-\naltitude and low-inclination orbit, which allowed infrequent access to the spacecraft \nfor commanding and data readout Table 10-40 summariies characteristics of the \ncommunications subsystem and the subsystem for command and data handling. \nHEAD-B's spacecraft had to maneuver and take payload data while out of sight of a \nground station. The commanding subsystem included a stored command programmer \nwhich coUld store and execute 256 commands. Data remained on a tape recorder until \nthe ground station read it out at communication intervals. \n\n\n\n348 Spacecraft Design and Sizing 10.6 \n\nTABLE 10-40.

Thermal balance is achieved by mounting the com-\nponents on external panels of the equipment compartment and allowing the panels to \nradiate excess heat to space. Second-surface mirrors serve as radiators, taking \nadvantage of their low solar absorptivity and high infrared emissivity. Areas not \nrequired for radiation are insulated. The spacecraft's interior surfaces are black to \nenhance internal heat transfer, and guard heaters prevent excessively low temperatures \nwhen equipment is off, or on sensitive assemblies such as propellant lines. \n\nTable 10-35 presented power budgets for FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B. Table \n10-41 shows the characteristics and components of their power subsystems. FL TSAT ~ \nCOM uses planar arrays oriented toward the Sun by solar-array drives and controls the \nbody's attitude about the Z-axis (yaw control). The array produces 1,800 W at begin-\nning of life. HEAO-B used planar solar panels which were body-mounted. They were \noriented toward the Sun by X-axis (roll) attitude control which kept the Sun in the X-Z \nbody plane. With this attitude, the Sun was up to 75 deg away from the array normal. \nTo improve this poor illumination, designers sized the array for 1,500 W under full \nsolar illumination. \n\nBoth FLTSATCOM and HEAC-B use NiCd batteries. The cycle life for FLTSAT-\nCOM was less than 1,000 cycles, and the three batteries operated at 70% depth of \ndischarge. They also contain bypass electronics to allow removal of failed cells. The \nthree HEAC-B batteries had a cycle life of over 5,000 cycles and operated at 20% \ndepth of discharge. \n\nTable 10-41 also shows the characteristics of the power control, switching, cabling, \nand conversion equipment on FLTSATCOM and HEAO-B. The FLTSATCOM \nspacecraft uses an unregulated bus and switches power to user subsystems in central \npower-control units. A central power converter provides secondary power for the \nspacecraft bus subsystems. HEAO-B used a regulated solar array and also switched \npower to users in a set of integration assemblies. These units also contained power \nconverters. \n\n10.6 Examples 349 \n\nTABLE 10-41.

The HEAO-B structure was a semi-monocoque in which longerons, stiff-\nened skin panels, and rings carried the loads. Both spacecraft were launched on the \nAtlas-Centaur and were designed to substantially the same boost loads. In the launch \nconfiguration, both spacecraft were about the same diameter, although IlEAC-B was \nslightly longer. The on-orbit configurations of the spacecraft were quite different \nbecause FLTSATCOM has a large, deployable, solar array and deployed antennas. \nIlEAC-B had essentially the same configuration on orbit as during launch. The two \nspacecraft had different designs for the load-carrying structure. FL TSATCOM carries \nloads with a central cylinder. The equipment compartment mounts around this cylin-\nder, and the deployables stay around the outside of the compartment during boost. \n\nDesign Integration \nTable 10-43 gives relations for estimating the spacecraft's size based on its weight. \n\nEquations.

It offers practical \ninsight into the mission and interface requirements that drive how we configure \nspacecraft. We include first-order approximations and describe hardware to show how \neach subsystem works and to help estimate the subsystem's size, weight. power \nrequirements, and eventual cost. We also reference many chapters of this book to \nintegrate concepts and subsystems. Chapter 17 discusses the propulsion subsystem, \nand Chap. 13 provides much of the communications theory. Chapter 10, Agrawal \n[19861, Chetty [19911, and Morgan and Gordon [19891 provide insight to the theory \nand practice of designing spacecraft subsystems. \n\nIn the rest of this chapter we will discuss these issues and an approach for estimat-\ning the size and configuration of spacecraft subsystems. \n\n353 \n\n\n\n354 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.1 \n\n11.1 Attitude Determination and Control \nJohn S. Etemo, Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corporation \n\nThe attitude determination and control subsystem (ADeS) stabilizes the vehicle \nand orientS it in desired directions during the mission despite the external disturbance \ntorques acti~g o~ it. This requires that the vehicle determine its attitude, using sensors, \nand control It. ~Ing actuators. The ADCS often is tightly coupled to other subsystems \non board, especIally the propulsion (Chap. 17) and navigation (Sec. 11.7) functions. \nAdditional information on attitude determination and control can be found in Wertz \n[1978, 2001], Kaplan [1976], Agrawal [1986], Hughes [1986], Griffin and French \n[1990], Chobotov [1991], and Fortescue and Stark [1992]. \n\nWe begin by discussing several useful concepts and definitions including mass \nproperties, disturbance torques, angular momentum, and reference v~ors. The mass \nproperties of a spacecraft are key in determining the size of control and disturbance \ntorques. We typically need to know the location of the center of mass or gravity (cg) \nas well as the elements of the inertia matrix: the moments and products of inertia about \nchose? re~erence axes .. (S~ Sec. 11.6 for examples of moment of inertia calculations.) \nThe dIreCtion of the pnnCIpal axes-~ose axes for which the inertia matrix is diagonal \nand the products of inertia are zero-are also of interest. Finally, we need to know how \nthese properties change with time, as fuel or other consumables are used, or as append-\nages are moved or deployed. \n\nA body in space. is subject to small but persistent disturbance torques (e.g., \n~()-4 ~'m) !fom a vanety of sources. These torques are categorized as cyclic, varying \nIn a SI~USOIdal manner during an orbit. or secular, accumulating with time, and not \naveragIng out over an orbit. These torques would quickly reorient the vehicle unless \nresist~ in .some w~y. ~ ADCS system resists these torques either passively, by \nexplOIting Inherent Inertia or magnetic properties to make the \"disturbances\" stabil-\nizing and their effects tolerable, or actively, by sensing the resulting motion and \napplying corrective torques. \n\nAngular momentum plays an important role in space, where torques typically are \ns~all and spacecraft are unconstrained. For a body initially at rest. an external torque \nwd~ cause.the body to angularly accelerate proportionally to the torque-resulting in \nan.IncreasIn~ angular velocity. Conversely, if the body is initially spinning about an \naJ?s perpendIcular to the applied torque, then the body spin axis will precess, moving \n~th a constant angular velocity proportional to the torque. Thus, spinning bodies act \nhke gyroscopes, inherently resisting disturbance torques in 2 axes by responding with \nconstant. rather.th~ increasing, angular velocity. This property of spinning bodies, \ncalled gyro~co!\"C stiffness, can be used to reduce the effect of small; cyclic disturbance \ntorques. ThIS IS true whether the entire body spins or just a portion of it, such as a \nmomentum wheel or spinning rotor. \n\nConservation of vehicle angular momentum requires that only externa1 torques \nchange the system net angular momentum. Thus, external disturbances must be \n~esisted by external control torques (e.g., thrusters or magnetic torquers) or the result-\nIng ~noI?entum buildup must be stored internally (e.g .\u2022 by reaction wheels) without \nreonenti~g the vehicle ~yond its allowable limits. The momentum buildup due to \nsecular dIsturbances ultimately must be reduced by applying compensating external \ncontrol torques. \n\n11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 355 \n\nOften, in addition to rejecting disturbances, tlte ADCS must reorient the vehicle (in \nslew maneuvers) to repoint the payload, solar arrays, or antennas. These periodic \nrepointing requirements may drive the design to larger actuators than would be \nrequired for disturbance rejection alone. \n\nTo orient the vehicle correctly, external references must be used to determine the \nvehicle's absolute attitude. These references include the Sun, the Earth\u00b7s IR horizon, \nthe local magnetic field direction. and the stars. In addition, inertial sensors (gyr0-\nscopes) also can be carried to provide a short-term attitude reference between external \nupdates. External references (e.g., Sun angles) are usually measured as body-centered \nangular distances to a vector. Each such vector measurement provides only two of the \nthree independent parameters needed to specify the orientation of the spacecraft. This \nresults in tlte need for multiple sensor types on board most spacecraft. \n\nTable 11-1 lists the steps for designing an ADCS for spacecraft.

The ADCS requirements are closely tied to mission needs and other subsystem \ncharacteristics. as shown in Fig. 11-2. These requirements may vary considerably with \nmission phase or modes, challenging the designer to develop a single hardware suite \nfor different objectives. \n\nFor many spacecraft, the ADCS must control vehicle attitude during firing of large \nliquid or solid rocket motors. which may be used during orbit insertion or for orbit \nchanges. Large motors create large disturbance torques, which can drive the design to \nlarger actuators tltan are needed once on station. \n\n\n\n356 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.1 \n\nTABLE 11-1.

The Impact of Mission Requirements and Other Subsystems on the ADCS \nSubsystem. Direction of arrows shows requirements flow from one 'subsystem to \nanother. \n\nIn most cases, we do not need to rotate the spacecraft quickly. But retargeting time \nmay be critical for some applications. In either case, slewing mainly influences the \nchoice and size of actuators. For example, the vehicle's maximum slew mte deter-\nmines the thrusters' size or the reaction wheel's maximum torque. High-mte maneu-\nvers may require other actuation systems, such as a second set of high-thrust reaction \njets or perhaps control moment gyros. \n\nFor FireSat, we assume that the launch vehicle places us in our final orbit, with no \nneed for ADCS control during orbit insertion. The normal pointing requirement is \n0.1 deg, nadir-oriented. Attitude determination must be autonomous, providing Earth-\nrelative knowledge better than 0.1 deg (to support the pointing requirement) while the \nvehicle is within 30 deg of nadir. In addition to these basic requirements, we will \nconsider an optional requirement for occasional repoin~g of the spacecraft to a region \nof interest. We want to examine how such a requirement would influence the design, \nincreasing the complexity and capability of the ADCS. For this option, we will assume \nthe requirement to repoint the vehicle once every 30 days. It must repoint, or slew, up \nto 30 deg in under 10 min, and hold the relative nadir orientation for 90 min. \n\n11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 359 \n\n11.1.2 Selection of Spacecraft Control Type \n\nOnce we have defined the subsystem requirements, we are ready to select a method \nof controlling the spacecraft. Table 11-4 lists several different methods of control, \nalong with typical chamcteristics of each. \n\nTABLE 11-4. Attitude Control Methods and Their Capabilities.

Magnetic torquers may be \nused from LEO to GEO. \n\nPassive Control Techniques. Gravity-gradient control uses the inertial properties \nof a vehicle to keep it pointed toward the Earth. This relies on the fact that an elongated \nobject in a gmvity field tends to align its longitudinal axis through the Earth's center. \nThe torques which cause this alignment decrease with the cube of the orbit milius, and \nare symmetric around the nadir vector, thus not influencing the yaw of a spacecraft \naround the nadir vector. This tendency is used on simple spacecraft in near-Earth \norbits without yaw orientation requirements, often with deployed booms to achieve the \ndesired inertias. \n\n\n\nSpacecraft Subsystems 11.1 \n\nFrequently, we add dampers to gravity-gradient spacecraft to reduce libration \n-small oscillations around the nadir vector caused by distUrbances. Gravity-gradient \nspa~ are P:uncul:rrly sensitive to thermal shocks on long deployed booms when \nentenng or leaVIng eclIpses. They also need a method of ensuring attitude capture with \nthe correct end of the spacecraft pointed at nadir-the gravity-gradient torques make \neither end along the minimum inertia axis equally stable. \n\nIn the simplest gravity-gradient spacecraft, only two orientation axes are \ncontrolled. The orientation around the nadir vector is unconstrained. To control this \n!hlrd axis,. a s~l, ~onstant-speed mo~entum wheel is. sometimes added along the \nmtended pItch axts (I.e., an axts perpendicular to the nadir and velocity vectors). This \n':Yaw\" whee~ is stable when it aligns with the orbit normal, and small energy dissipa-\ntion mecharusms on board cause the spacecraft to seek this minimum energy stable \norientation without active control. ' \n\nA third type of purely passive control uses permanent magnets on board the \nspacecraft to force alignment along the Earth's magnetic field. This is most effective \nin near-equatorial orbits where the field orientation stays almost constant for an Earth-\npointing vehicle. \n\n~pin Con~l Techniques. Spin stabilization is a passive control technique in \nwhIch the entire spacecraft rotates so that its angular momentum vector remains \napproximately fixed in inertial space. Spin-stabilized spacecraft (or spinners), employ \nthe gyroscopic stability discussed earlier to passively resist disturbance torques about \ntwo axes. The spinning motion is stable (in its minimum energy state) if the vehicle is \nsp~nning about the axis having the largest moment of inertia. Energy dissipation mech-\nanISms on board, such as fuel slosh and structural damping) will cause any vehicle to \nhead toward this state if uncontrolled. Thus disk-shaped spinners are passively stable \nw!rile pencil-shaped vehicles are not. Spinners can be simple, survive for long periods \nWlth?ut attention, provide a thermally benign environment for components, and \nproVIde a scanning motion for sensors. The principal disadvantages of spin stabiliza-\ntion are (1) that the vehicle mass properties must be controlled to ensure the desired \nspin direction and stability and (2) that the angular momentum vector requires more \nfuel ~o reori~t than a vehicle with no net angular momentum, reducing the usefulness \nof thIS technique for payloads that must be repointed frequently. \n\nIt takes extra fuel to reorient a spinner because of the gyroscopic stiffness which \nalso helps it resist disturbances. In reorienting a spinning body with angular momen-\ntum,. h, a constant torque, T, will produce an angular velocity, (i), perpendicular to the \napplIed torque and angular momentum vector, of magnitude (i) = T Ih. Thus, the higher \nthe stored momentum is, the more torque must be applied for a given (i). For a maneu-\nver through ~ angle 9, the torque-time product-an indication of fuel required for the \n?I~euver-Is a co~tant equal to h9. Conversely, for a nonspinning vehicle with no \nlmtial angular ~eloclty, a small torque can be used to start it rotating, with an opposite \ntorque to stop It. The fuel used for any angle maneuver can be infinitesimally small if \na slow maneuver is acceptable. \n\nA useful variation of spin control is called dual-spin stabilization, where the \nspace<:ra!t has two sectiO?S spin~g at diffc:rent rates about the same axis. Normally, \none section, the rotor, spms rapIdly to proVide angular momentum while the second \nsection, the stator or platform, is despun to keep one axis pointed t~ward the Earth or \nS~. By combining inertiaIly fixed and rotating sections on the same vehicle, dual \nSPlDDers ~ ~omm~te a variety of payloads in a simple vehicle. Also, by adding \nenergy diSsIpation deVIces to the platform, a dual spinner can be passively stable \n\nH.I Attitude Determination and Control 361 \n\nspinning about the axis with the smallest moment of inertia. This permits more pencil-\nshaped spacecraft, which fit better in laun~h vehicle fairings. Th~ disadv~tag~ of \ndual-spin stabilization is the added co~pleXity ?f the platform bearing and slIp ~~gs \nbetween the sections. This compleXity can Increase cost and reduce reliabIlity \ncompared to simple spin stabilization. . \n\nSpinning spacecraft, both simple and dual, exhibit several distinct types of motion \nwhich often are confused. Precession is the motion of the angular momentum vector \ncaused by external torques such as thruster firings. Wobble is the ap~ent motion of \nthe body when it is spinning with the angular momentum v~or aligned along a \nprincipal axis of inertia which is offset from a body reference axis-for example, the \nintended spin axis. This looks like motion of the intended spin axis around the angular \nmomentum vector at the spin rate. \n\nNutation is the torque-free motion of the spacecraft body when the angular \nmomentum vector is not perfectly aligned along a principal axis of inertia. For rod-\nshaped objects, this motion is a slow rotation (compared to spin rate) of the spin axis \naround the angular momentum vector. For these objects, spinning about a minimum \ninertia axis, additional energy dissipation will cause increased nutation. For disk-\nshaped objects, spinning around a maximum inertia axis, nutation appears as a high~r\u00ad\nthan-spin-rate tumbling. Energy dissipation for these objects (e.g., with a passive \nnutation damper) reduces nutation, resulting in a clean spin. \n\nNutation is caused by disturbances such as thruster impulses, and can be seen as \nvarying signals in body-mounted inertial and external sensors. Wobble is caused by \nimbalance and appears as constant offsets in body-mounted sensors. Such constant \noffsets are rarely discernible unless multiple sensors are available. \n\nSpin stability normally requires active control, such as mass expulsion or magnetic \ncoils. to periodically adjust the spacecraft's attitude and spin rate to coun~eract \ndisturbance torques. In addition, we may need to damp the nutation caused by distur-\nbances, precession commands, or fuel slosh. Aggravating this nutation is the effect of \nstructural flexure and fuel slosh, which is present in any space vehicle to one degree \nor another. Once the excitation stops, nutation decreases as these same factors dissi-\npate the energy. But this natural damping can take hours. We can neutralize this source \nof error in minutes with nutation dampers (see Sec. 11.1.2). We can also reduce the \namount of nutation from these sources by increasing the spin rate, thus increasing the \nstiffness of the spinning vehicle. If the spin rate is 20 rpm, and the nutation angle is \n3 deg, then at 60 rpm the nutation angle would decrease by a factor of three. Y'e sel-\ndom use spin rates above 90 rpm because of the large centrifugal forces and their effect \non structural design and weight. In thrusting and pointing applications, spin !~tes \nunder 20 rpm may allow excessive nutation and are not used. However, noncntical \napplications, such as thermal control, are frequently insensitive to nutation and may \nemploy very low spin rates. \n\nThree-axis Control Techniques. Spacecraft stabilized in 3 axes are more common \ntoday than those using spin or gravity gradient. They maneuver and can be stable ~d \naccurate, depending on their sensors and actuators. But they are also more expensIve \nand more complex. The control torques about the axes of 3-axis systems come from \ncombinations of momentum wheels, reaction wheels, control moment gyros, thrusters. \nor magnetic torquers. Broadly, however, these systems take two forms: one uses mo-\nmentum bias by placing a momentum wheel along the pitch axis; the other is called \nzero momentum with a reaction wheel on each axis. Either option usually needs thrust-\ners or magnetic torquers as well as the wheels. \n\n\n\n362 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.1 \n\nIn a zero-momentum system, reaction wheels respond to disturbances on the vehi-\ncle. For example, a vehicle-pointing error creates a signal which speeds up the wheel, \ninitially at zero. This torque corrects the vehicle and leaves the wheel spinning at low \nspeed, until another pointing error speeds the wheel further or slows it down again. If \nthe disturbance is cyclic during each orbit, the wheel may not approach saturation \nspeed for several orbits. Secular disturbances, however, cause the wheel to drift toward \nsaturation. We then must apply an external torque, usually with a thruster or magnetic \ntorquer, to force the wheel speed back to zero. This process, called desaturation, \nmomentum unloading, or momentum dumping, can be done automatically or by com-\nmand from the ground. \n\nWhen high torque is required for large vehicles or fast slews, a variation of 3-axis \ncontrol is possible using control moment gyros, or CMGs. These devices work like \nmomentum wheels on gimbals. (See Sec. 11.1.4 for a further discussion of CMOs.) \nThe control of CMOs is complex, but their available torque for a given weight and \npower can make them attractive. . \n\nAs a final type of zero momentum 3-axis control, simple all-thruster systems are \nused for short durations when high torque is needed, such as orbit insertion or during \nIl V bums from large motors. These thrusters then may be used for different purposes \nsuch as momentum dumping during other mission modes. \n\nMomentum bias systems often have just one wheel with its spin axis mounted along \nthe pitch axis, normal to the orbit plane. The wheel is run at a nearly constant, high \nspeed to provide gyroscopic stiffness to the vehicle, just as in spin stabilization, with \nsimilar nutation dynamics. Around the pitch axis, however, the spacecraft can control \nattitude by torquing the wheel, slightly increasing or decreasing its speed. Periodically, \nthe pitch wheel must be desaturated (brought back to its nominal speed), as in zero-\nmomentum systems, using thrusters or magnets. \n\nThe dynamics of nadir-oriented momentum-bias vehicles exhibit a phenomenon \nknown as roll-yaw coupling. To see this coupling, consider an inertially-fixed angular \nmomentum vector at some angle with respect to the orbit plane. If the angle is initially \na positive roll error, then 1/4 orbit later it appears purely about the yaw axis as a \nnegative yaw error. As the vehicle continues around the orbit, the angle goes through \nnegative roll and positive yaw before realigning as positive roll. This coupling, which \nis due to the apparent motion of the Earth and, therefore, the Earth-fixed coordinate \nframe as seen from the spacecraft, can be exploited to control roll and yaw over a quar-\nter orbit using only a roll sensor. \n\nEffects of Requirements on Control Type. With the above knowledge of control \ntypes, we can proceed to select a type which best meets mission requirements. Tables \n11-5 through 11-7 describe the effects of orbit insertion, payload pointing, and payload \nslew requirements on the selection process. \n\nA common control approach during orbit insertion is to use the short-term spin \nstability of the spacecraft-orbit-insertion motor combination. Once on station, the \nmotor may be jettisoned, the spacecraft despun using jets or a yo-yo device, and a \ndifferent control technique used. \n\nPayload pointing will influence the ADCS control method, the class of sensors, and \nthe number and kind of actuation devices. Occasionally, pointing accuracies are so \nstringent that a separate, articulated platform is necessary. An articulated platform can \nperform scanning operations much easier than the host vehicle, with better accuracy \nand stability. \n\n11.1 Attitude Determination and Control \n\nTABLE 11-5.

Section 5.4 discusseS how to develop pointing budgets. \n\nFireSat Control Selection. For FireSat, we consider two options for orbit insertion \ncontrol. Frrst, the launch vehicle may directly inject the spacecraft into its mission \norbit. This common option simplifies the spacecraft design, since no special insertion \nmode is needed. An alternate approach, useful for small spacecraft such as FrreSat, is \nto use a monopropellant system on board the spacecraft to fly itself up from a low park-\ning orbit to its final altitude. For small insertion motors, reaction wheel torque or \nmomentum bias stabilization may be sufficient to control the vehicle during this bum. \nFor larger motors, AV thruster modulation or dedicated ADCS thrusters become \nattractive. \n\nOnce on-station, the spacecraft must point its sensors at nadir most of the time and \nslightly off-nadir for brief periods. Since the payload needs to be despun and the space-\ncraft frequently reoriented, spin stabilization is not the best choice. Gravity-gradient \nand passive magnetic control cannot meet the 0.1 deg pointing requirement or the \n30 deg slews. This leaves 3-axis control and momentum-bias stabilization as viable \noptions for the on-station control as well. \n\nDepending on other factors, either approach might work, and we will baseline \nmomentum bias control with its simpler hardware requirements. In this case, we will \nuse a single pitch wheel for momentum and electromagnets for momentum dumping \nand roll and yaw control. \n\nFor the optional off-nadir pointing requirement, 3-axis control with reaction wheels \nmight be more appropriate. Also, 3-axis control often can be exploited to simplify the \nsolar array design, by using one of the unconstrained payload axes (yaw, in this case) \nto replace a solar array drive axis. Thus, the reduced array size possible with 2 deg of \nfreedom can be achieved with one array axis drive and one spacecraft rotation. \n\n11.1.3 Quantify the Disturbance Environment \n\nIn this step, we determine the size of the external torques the ADCS must tolerate. \nOnly three or four sources of torque matter for the typical Earth-orbiting spacecraft. \nThey are gravity-gradient effects, magnetic-field torques on the vehicle, impingement \n\n11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 365 \n\nTABLE 11-8.

Tables 11-9A and 11-9B summanze the four major distur-\nbances, provide equations to estimate their size for the worst case, and calculate values \nfor the FrreSat example. . \n\nDisturbances can be affected by the spacecraft orientation, mass properties, and \ndesign symmetry. For the normal FrreSat orientation, the larg~t torque is due to th.e \nresidual magnetism in the spacecraft. If, however, we use the optional ~O-deg off-nadir \npointing, the gravity-gradient torque increases over an o~der of ma~tude, ~ become \nas large as the magnetic torque. Note that we use 1 deg ID the graVIty-gradient calc?-\nlations, rather than the 0.1 deg pointing accuracy. This is to account for our uncertain \nknowledge of the principal axes. If the principal axes are off by several degrees, ~t \nangle may dominate in the disturbance calculations. We also note ~ a less symmetriC \nsolar array arrangement would have increased both the aerodynamtc and solar torques, \nmaking them closer to the magnetic torque in this example. \n\n\n\n366 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.1 \n\nTABLE 11-9A.

Actua~rs. We flI'St discuss the actuators, ~ summarized in Table II-II, beginning \n\nWlth reaction and momentum wheels. Reaction wheels are essentially torque motors \nwith high-inertia rotors. They can spin in either direction, and provide one axis of con-\ntrol for each wheel. Momentum wheels are reaction wheels with a nominal spin rate \nabove zero to provide a nearly constant angular momentum. This momentum provides \ngyroscopic stiffness to two axes, While the motor torque may be controlled to precisely \npoint around the third axis. \n\nIn sizing wheels, it is important to distinguish between cyclic and secular distur-\nbances, and between angular momentum storage and torque authority. For 3-axis \ncontrol systems, cyclic torques build up cyclic angular momentum in reaction wheels, \nas the wheels provide compensating torques to keep the vehicle from moving. We \ntypi~y size the angular momentum capacity of a reaction wheel (limited by its \nsaturation speed) to handle the cyclic storage during an orbit without the need for fre-\nquent momentum dumping. Thus, the average disturbance torque for 114 or 112 orbit \ndetermines the minimum storage capability. The secular torques and our total storage \ncapacity then define how frequently angular momentum must be dumped. \n\nThe torque capability of the wheels usually is determined by slew requirements or \nthe need for control authority above the peak disturbance torque in order for the wheels \nto maintain pointing accuracy. \n\nFor 3-axis control, at least three wheels are required with their spin axes not \ncoplanar. Often, a fourth redundant wheel is carried in case one of the three primaries \n\n11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 369 \n\nTABLE 11-11. Typical ADCS Actuators.

If the wheels are not orthogonal (and the redundant one never is), additional \ntorque and momentum authority may be necessary to compe~~te for the ~fa.vorable \ngeometry. It is also common to use wheels larger than the mmnnum required m order \nto use a standard component . \n\nFor spin-stabilized or momentum-bias systems, the cyclic torques.will ca~ cyclic \nrates while the secular torques cause gradual divergence. We typICally desIgn the \nstored angular momentum, determined by spin rate and inertia of the spi~g ~y, \nto be large enough to keep the cyclic motion within our pointing specification Without \nactive control during an orbit Periodic torquing will still be required to counte~ct th~ \nsecular disturbances. The more angular momentum in the body, the more reSIstant It \nis to external torques. An upper limit on the stored momentum, if one exists, may be \ndefined by the fuel cost to precess this angular momentum. . . . \n\nFor high-torque applications, control-~ment gyros may.be .used mstead of reac-\ntion wheels. These are single- or double-gunbaled wheels spmnmg at constant speed. \nBy turning the gimbal axis, we can obtain a high-output torque whose size ~epends on \nthe speed of the rotor and the gimbal rate of rotation. Control systems Wlth control \nmoment gyros can produce large torques about all three of the spacecraft's ~ogonal \naxes so we most often use them for agile (high-rate) maneuvers. They reqwre a com-\nplex'controllaw and momentum exchange for desaturation. Other disadvantages are \nhigh cost and weight \n\nSpacecraft also use magnetic torquers as actuatio~ de~ces. These torquers ~ \nmagnetic coils or electromagnets to generate magnetic dipole moments .. Magne~c \ntorquers can compensate for the spacecraft's residual magnetic fields or attitude drift \nfrom minor disturbance torques. They also can desaturate momentum-exchange sys-\ntems but usually require much more time than thrus~rs. A .magnetic ~uer produces \ntorque proportional (and perpendicular) to the Earth s varymg magnetic field. Electro-\nmagnets have the advantage of no moving parts, requiring only a magnetometer for \nfield sensing and a wire-wound, electromagnetic rod in .each ~s.

We consider them to be a hot-gas \nsystem, either bipropellant or monopropellant, when a chemical reaction produceS the \nenergy. They are a cold-gas system when energy comes from the latent heat of a phase \nchange or from the work of compression without a phase change. Cold-gas systems \nusually apply to small spacecraft and low-impulse requirements. \n\nThrusters produce torques and forces that: \n\n\u2022 Control attitude \u2022 Adjust orbits \n\n\u2022 Control nutation \n\n\u2022 ~aneuverspacecraft \nover large angles \n\n\u2022 Control the spin rate \n\n\u2022 Dump extra momentum from a momentum \nwheel, reaction wheel, or control moment gyro \n\nUnfortunately, their plumes may impinge on the spacecraft, contaminating surfaces, \nand they require expendable propellant, dictating spacecraft life. An advantage is that \nthey can provide large, instantaneous torques at any point in the orbit \n\nWe must decide whether we need thrusters, how many we need, and where to locate \nthem. For applications that demand fine control from the thrusters, we may have to \nspecify the minimum impulse from a single thruster pulse--usually 20 ms or greater. \nSingle thrust levels are usually used, unless the complication of dual or variable thrust \nis required. \n\nAlthough the baseline FrreSat spacecraft will use magnetic torquers, we illustrate \nthe thruster sizing calculations for momentum dumping and the optional slew require-\nment We will assume the thruster's moment arm is 0.5 m. Table 11-13 gives proce-\ndures and simplified equations, where applicable, for sizing thrusters and estimating \npropellant. Refer to Chap. 17 for a thorough discussion of propulsion subsystems. \n\nThe size of the thrusters and required propellent are small for this example. For the \noptional system with reaction wheels, slewing can be accomplished with the wheels, \navoiding use of propellent For the baseline momentum bias system, we would use \nthrusters for the optional slews, though large electromagnets could be used if thrusters \nwere not available and maneuver time were not important. \n\nSensors. We complete this hardware unit by selecting the sensors needed for \ncontrol. Consult Table 11-14 for a summary of typical devices, as well as their perfor-\nmance and physical characteristics. Note, however, that sensor technology is evolving \nrapidly, promising more accurate, lighter-weight sensors for future mission. . \n\nSun sensors are visible-light detectors which measme one or two angles between \ntheir mounting base and incident sunlight They are popular, accurate and reliable, but \nrequire clear fields of view. They can be used as part of the nonnaI attitude determi-\nnation system, part of the initial acquisition or failure recovery system, or part of an \nindependent solar array orientation system. Since most low-Earth orbits inclllde \neclipse periods, Sun-sensor-based attitude determination systems must provide some \nway of tolerating the regular loss of this data without violating pointing constraints. \n\nSun sensors can be quite accurate \u00ab 0.01 deg) but it is not always possible to take \nadvantage of that feature. We usually mount Sun sensors near the ends of the vehicle \nto obtain an unobstructed field of view. Sun sensor accuracy can be limited by struc-\ntural bending on large spacecraft. Spinning satellites use specially designed Sun sen-\nsors that measure the angle of the Sun with respect to the spin axis of the vehicle.

Star sensors can be scanners or trackers. \nScanners are used on spinning spacecraft. Stars pass through multiple slits in a scan-\n\n\n\n374 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.1 \n\nner's field of view. After several star crossings, we can derive the vehicle's attitude. \nWe use trackers on 3-axis attitude stabilized spacecraft to track one or more stars to \nderive 2- or 3-axis attitude infonnation. The most sophisticated units not only track the \nstars as bright spots, but identify which star pattern they are viewing, and output the \nsensor's orientation compared to an inertial reference. Putting this software inside the \nsensor .simplifies processing requirements of the remaining attitude control software. \n\nWhile star sensors excel in accuracy, care is required in their specfication and use. \nFor example, the vehicle must be stabilized to some extent before the trackers can \ndet~e where they point This stabilization may require alternate sensors, which \ncan mcrease total system cost. Also, star sensors are susceptible to being blinded by \nthe Sun, Moon, or even planets, which must be accommodated in their application. \nWhere the mission requires the highest accuracy and justifies a high cost, we use a \nC?mbination of star trackers and gyros. These two sensors complement each other \nmcely: the gyros can be used for initial stabilization. and during periods of sun or \nmoon interference in the trackers, while the trackers can be used to provide a high-\naccuracy, low frequency, external reference unavailable to the gyros. Work continues \nto improve the sample rate of star trackers and to reduce their radiation sensitivity. \n\nHorizon sensors are infrared devices that detect the contrast betWeen the cold of \ndeep space and the heat of the Earth's atmosphere (about 40 km above the surface in \nthe sensed band). Simple narrow field-of-view fixed-head types (called pippers or \nhorizon crossing indicators) are used on spinning spacecraft to measure Earth phase \nand chord angles ~hich, together with orbit and mounting geometry, define two angles \nto the Earth (nadir) vector. Scanning horizon sensors use a rotating mirror or lens to \n~place (or augment) the spinning spacecraft body. They are often used in pairs for \nlDlproved performance and redundancy. Some nadir-pointing spacecraft use staring \nsensors which view the entire Earth disk' (from GEO) or a portion of the limb (from \nLEO). The sensor fields of view stay fixed with respect to the spacecraft. This type \nworks best for circular orbits. \n\nHorizon sensors provide Earth-relative information directly for Earth-pointing \nspacecraft, which may simplify onboard processing. The scanning types require clear \nfields o~ view for their ~an con~ (typically 45,60, or 90 deg, half-angle). Typical \n~CCuraCles for systems usmg honzon sensors are 0.1 to 0.25 deg, with some applica-\nbons approaching 0.03 deg. For the highest accuracy in low-Earth orbit, it is necessary \nto correct the data for Earth oblateness and seasonal horizon variations. \n\nMagnetometers are simple, reliable, lightweight sensors that measure both the \ndirection and size of the Earth's magnetic field. When compared to the Earth's known \nfield, their output helps us establish the spacecraft's attitude. But their accuracy is not \nas good as that of star or horizon references. The Earth's field can shift with time and \nis not known precisely in the fIrst place. To improve accuracy, we often combine their \ndata with data from Sun or horizon sensors. When a vehicle using magnetic torquers \npasses through magnetic-field reversals during each orbit, we use a magnetometer to \ncontrol the polarity of the torquer output The torquers usually must be turned off while \nthe magnetometer is sampled to avoid corrupting the measurement. \n\nGPS r~ceivers are commonly known as high-accuracy navigation devices. Recently, \n~PS receIvers have been used for attitude determination by employing the differential \nSIgnalS from separate antennas on a spacecraft. Such sensors offer the promise of low \ncost and weight for LEO missions, and are being used in low accuracy applications or \n~ !>ack-up sensors. Development continues to improve their accuracy, which is \nlimited by the separation of the antennas, the ability to resolve small phase differences, \n\n11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 375 \n\nthe relatively long wavelength, and multipath effects due to reflections off spacecraft \ncomponents. \n\nGyroscopes are inertial sensors which measure the speed or angle of rotation from \nan initial reference, but without any knowledge of an external, absolute reference. We \nuse them in spacecraft for precision attitude sensing when combined with external \nreferences such as star or sun sensors, or, for brief periods, for nutation damping or \nattitude control during thruster firing. Manufacturers use a variety of physical \nphenomena, from simple spinning wheels (iron gyros using ball or gas bearings) to \nring lasers, hemispherical resonating surfaces, and laser fiber optic bundles. The gyro \nmanufacturers, driven by aircraft markets, steadily improve accuracy while reducing \nsize and mass. \n\nError models for gyroscopes vary with the technology, but characterize the deteri-\noration of attitude knowledge with time (degrees per hour or per square-root of time). \nWhen used with an accurate external reference, such as star trackers, gyros can provide \nsmoothing (filling in the measurement gaps between star tracker samples) and higher \nfrequency information (tens to hundreds of hertz), while the star trackers provide the \nlow frequency, absolute orientation information that the gyros lack. Individual gyros \nprovide one or two axes of infonnation, and are often grouped together as an Inertial \nReference Unit, IRU, for three full axes. IRUs with accelerometers added for posi-\ntionlvelocity sensing are called Inertial Measurement Units, IMUs. \n\nSensor selection. Sensor selection is most directly influenced by the required \norientation of the spacecraft (e.g., Earth- or inertial-pointing) and its accuracy. Other \ninfluences include redundancy, fault tolerance, field of view requirements, and avail-\nable data rates. Typically, we identify candidate sensor suites and conduct a trade \nstudy to determine the best, most cost-effective approach. In such studies, the exist-\nence of off-the-shelf components and software can strongly influence the outcome. In \nthis section we will only briefly describe some selection guidelines. \n\nFull 3-axis knowledge requires at least two external vector measurements, although \nwe use inertial platforms or spacecraft angular momentum (from spinning or momen-\ntum wheels) to hold the attitude between external measurements. In some cases, if \nattitude knowledge can be held for a fraction of an orbit, the external vectors (e.g., \nEarth or magnetic) will have moved enough to provide the necessary infonnation. \n\nFor Earth-pointed spacecraft, horizon sensors provide a direct measurement of \npitch and roll axes, but require augmentation for yaw measurements. Depending on the \naccuracy required, we 'use Sun sensors, magnetometers, or momentum-bias control \nrelying on roll-yaw coupling for the third degree of freedom. For inertially-pointing \nspacecraft, star and Sun sensors provide the most direct measurements, and inertial \nplatforms are ideally suited. Frequently, only one measurement is made in the ideal \ncoordinate frame (Earth or inertial), and the spacecraft orbit parameters are required \nin order to convert a second measurement or as an input to a magnetic field model. The \nparameters are usually uplinked to the spacecraft from ground tracking, but autono-\nmous navigation systems using GPS are also in use (see Sec. 11.1). \n\nFu-eSat sensors. The external sensors for FrreSat could consist of any of the types \nidentified. For the 0.1 deg Earth-relative pointing requirement, however, horizon sen-\nsors are the most obvious choice since they directly measure two axes we need to \ncontrol. The accuracy requirement makes a star sensor a strong candidate as well, \nalthough its infonnation needs to be transfoJmed to Earth-relative pointing for our use. \nThe 0.1 deg accuracy is at the low end of horizon sensors' typical performance, and \nwe need to be careful to get the most out of their data. \n\n\n\n376 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.1 \n\nTABLE 11\u00b715.

(Often, it is useful to question a tight yaw requirement. Many payloads, e.g., \nantennas, some cameras, radars, are not sensitive to rotations around their pointing \naxis. For this discussion, we will assume the requirement is fum.) We could use sun \nsensors, but their data needs to be replaced during eclipses. Magnetometers don't have \nthe necessary accuracy on their own, but with our momentum-bias system, roll-yaw \ncoupling, and some yaw filtering, a magnetometer-Sun sensor system should work. \n\n11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 377 \n\nAt this point, we consider the value of an inertial reference package. Such packages, \nalthough heavy and expensive, provide a short-term attitude reference which would \n\nemit the Earth vector data to be used for full 3-axis knowledge over an orbit.

Diagram of a Typical AttHude Control System with Control Along a Single Axis. \nControl algorithms are usually implemented In an onboard processor and analyzed \nwith detailed sImulations. \n\n!Ie typically apply linear theory only to preliminary analysis and design. As the \n~eslgn matures, nonlinear effects come strongly into play. These effects may be \ninherent or intentionally introduced to improve the system's performance. Feedback \ncon~l systems are of two kinds, ~ased on th: flow of their control signals. They are \nc0n1!nuous-tiata systems when theIr control Signals flow continuously without inter-\nruption; they are sampled-data systems when sampling occurs at equal intervals. Most \nmodern spacecraft process data through digital computers and therefore use control \nsystems that sample data . \n\n. Although it is beyond the scope of this handbook to provide detailed design \ngw~ce on feedba~k control systems, the system designer should recognize the inter-\nacting effects of attitude control system loop gain, capability of the attitude control \nsystem to co~pensate for disturbances, accuracy of attitude control, and control \nsystem bandWidth. \n\n11.1 Attitude Determination and Control 371) \n\nTbree-axis stabilization. Different types of active control systems have different \nkey parameters and algorithms. Frequently, 3-axis control can be decoupled into three \nindependent axes. The most basic design parameter in each axis is its position gain, \nK .\" This is the amount of control torque which results from a unit attitude error and \nck be expressed in N\u00b7m/deg or N\u00b7m/rad. The position gain is selected by the designer \nand must be high enough to provide the required attitude control accuracy in the \npresence of disturbances, or Kp ~ TDlfJe> where Kp is position gain, TD is peak distur-\nbance torque, and fJe is allowable attitude error. \n\nThe value of the position gain also determines the attitude control system band-\nwidth and speed-of-response. The bandwidth is given by (()n = (Kp II)IIl, where 1 is the \nspacecraft moment of inertia. The bandwidth defines the frequency at which control \nauthority begins to diminish. Attitude control and disturbance rejection are effective \nfrom 0 frequency (d.c.) up to the bandwidth. Speed o/response is approximately the \nreciprocal of bandwidth. Note that position gain is inversely proportional to allowable \nerror and bandwidth is proportional to the square root of position gain. Therefore, high \naccuracy implies high position gain and high bandwidth. However, high bandwidth \nmay cause bending resonances to affect control system performance. \n\nWith the relations given, the system designer can estimate required position gain \nfrom his estimates of disturbance torque and accuracy requirements. He can use this \nestimate to compute control system bandwidth. This allows him to specify minimum \nbending frequencies as discussed below. \n\nIn defining algorithms for the control system, we must also consider whether the \nvehicle will have flexible-body effects that can make the vehicle unstable. Spacecraft \nwith flexible appendages such as antennas, booms, and solar panels may produce \nslight warping at their natural frequencies. Control torques and external-disturbance \ntorques will cause structural vibrations, in some cases close to or within the control \nsystem's bandwidth. The lowest natural frequencies of flexible components should be \nat least an order of magnitude greater than the rigid-body frequencies before we can \nneglect flexibility. For further discussion of how structural flexibility affects the \ncontrol subsystem, see Sec. 3.12 of Agrawal [1986]. \n\nSpin stabilization and momentum bias. The fundamental concept in spin stab-\nilization is the nutation frequency of the vehicle. For a spinning body, the inertial \nnutation frequency \u00ab(()m) is equal to \n\nIs \n(l) \u2022 =-(() \n\nm I s \nT \n\n(11-1) \n\nwhere Is is the spin axis inertia, IT is the transverse axis inertia, and (()s is the spin \nfrequency. \n\nFor a momentum-bias vehicle with a stable body and a momentum wheel (or a dual-\nspin vehicle with a stable platform and a spinning rotor), the nutation frequency is \n\nh \n(() . =-\n\nm IT \n(11-2) \n\n\u2022 In its simplest form, a spacecraft attitude control system ~ be represented in s-domain as a \n111/ plant and may be controlled by a proportionol plus derivative (PD) controller where \nTc e Kp 8\u00a3 + K,r 8e \u2022 \u00b7The position gain, Kp' controls system bandwidth and the rate gain, K,.. \ncontrols dampmg. \n\n\n\n380 spacecraft Subsystems 11.1 \n\nwhere h is the angular momentum of the spinning body. Thus, spaceCraft with large \ninertias and small wheels have small nutation frequencies (Le .. long periods). \n\nAttempting to move the vehicle with a bandwidth faster than the nutation frequency \ncauses it to act more like a 3-axis vehicle. In general, we attempt to control near the \nnutation frequency or slower, with correspondingly small torques. In this area, the \nvehicle acts like a gyroscope, with the achieved angular rate, W, proportional to the \napplied torque, T: \n\nw;. TIh (11-3) \nwhere h is the system angular momentum. \n\nA lower limit on control bandwidth is usually provided by the orbit rate W , which \nfor a circular orbit is 0 \n\n(11-4) \n\nwhere J1 = 3.986 x 1014 m3/s2 and r is the orbit\"radius. \nAttitude determination. A full discussion of determination algorithms requires a \n\ndedicated reference such as Wertz [1978]. We will highlight only some of the basic \nconcepts. \n\nThe basic algorithms for determination depend on the coordinate frames of interest \n(e.g .. the sensor frames, local vertical frame, or Earth-centered inertial frame), and the \ngeometry of the measurements, parameterized by Euler angles (such as roll, pitch, and \nyaw) or quatemions (which are scaled vectors for Eigen-axis rotations of coordinate \nframes). Inertial platforms and star sensor data usually are suited to inertial quater-\nnions, while Earth-pointing spacecraft often use a local-vertical, aircraft-like set of \nEuler angles. \n\nSimple spacecraft may use the sensor readings directly for control, while more \ncomplex vehicles or those with higher accuracy requirements employ some form of \naveraging, smoothing, or Kalman filtering of the data. The exact algorithms depend on \nthe vehicle properties, orbit, and sensor types used. \n\nFireSat algorithms. For our momentum-bias FrreSat example, control separates \ninto pitch-axis control using torque commands to the momentum wheel, and roll-yaw \ncontrol using current commands to the electromagnets. The pitch-wheel desaturation \ncommands must also be fed (at a slow rate) to the magnets. The pitch-wheel control is \nstraightforward, using proportional-plus derivative and, optionally, integral control. \nThe roll-yaw control design starts by using the linearized nutation dynamics of the \nsystem, and is complicated by the directional limitations of electromagnetic torque \n(the achievable torque is perpendicular to the instantaneous Earth magnetic field). \n\nThe nadir-oriented control system may use an Earth-referenced, aircraft-like Euler \nangle (roll, pitch, yaw) set, although quaternions should also be considered for their \nlack of singularities during off-nominal pointing. The horizon sensors directly read \ntwo of the angles of interest, pitch and roll. Yaw needs to be measured directly from \nSliD position (during orbit day) or from the magnetometer readings (using a stored \nmodel of the Earth's field), or inferred from the roll-yaw coupling descnOed earlier. \nThe magnetic field and Sun information require an uplinked set of orbit parameters, \nand increase the computational requirements of the subsystem. Overall, meeting the \n0.1. deg yaw requireD?ent when the Sun is not visible will be the toughest challenge \nfacmg the ADCS deSIgner, and a form of coasting through the blackouts, without di-\nrect roll-yaw control, may be most appropriate. \n\n11.2 Telemetry~ Tracking, and Command 381 \n\n11.2 Telemetry, Tracking, and Command \n\nDouglas Kirkpatrick, United Stotes Air Force Academy \nAdapted from SMAD n, Sec. 11.2 \"Communications,\" by John Ford \n\nThe telemetry, tracking, and commond (1T&C) or communications subsystem \nprovides the interface between the spacecraft and ground systems. Payload mission \ndata and spacecraft housekeeping data pass from the spacecraft through this subsystem \nto operators and users at the operations center. Operator commands also pass to the \nspacecraft through this subsystem to control the spacecraft and to operate the payload. \nWe must design the hardware and their functions to pass the data reliably for all the \nspacecraft's operating modes. For a discussion of how we collect and manipulate \nhousekeeping and payload data, see Sec. 11.3, Chap. 9, and Chap. 16. Chapter 13 \ndiscusses the communication link design, and Morgan and Gordon [1989] provide a \nwealth of information on spacecraft communications. \n\nThe subsystem functions include the following: \n\n\u2022 Carrier tracking (lock onto the ground station signal) \n\n\u2022 Command reception and detection (receive the uplink signal and process it) \n\n\u2022 Telemetry modulation and transmission (accept data from spacecraft systems, \nprocess them, and transmit them) \n\n\u2022 Ranging (receive, process, and transmit ranging signals to determine the satel-\nlite's position) \n\n\u2022 Subsystem operations (process subsystem data, maintain its own health and \nstatus, point the antennas, detect and recover faults.) \n\nTable 11-18 presents specific subfunctions to accomplish these main functions. \nSubsystem designers must ensure that all of these functions operate reliability to \naccomplish the spacecraft mission. \n\nAs part of carrier tracking, most satellite IT &C subsystems generate a downlink \nRF signal that is phase coherent to the uplink signal. Phase coherence means that we \ntransmit the downlink carrier so its phase synchronizes with the received phase of the \nuplink carrier. This process is the coherent turnaround or two-way-coherent mode. \nThe coherent turnaround process creates a downlink carrier frequency precisely offset \nfrom the uplink carrier by a predefined numerical turnaround ratio. This is the ratio of \nthe downlink carrier frequency to the uplink carrier frequency.This operational mode \ncan only exist when the transmitter phase-locks to the received uplink carrier. For a \ngiven uplink signal, the downlink signal has a constant phase difference. For NASA's \nGSIDN-compatible transponders, the receiver downcoverts the uplink carrier, and \ncreates a voltage such that the receiver's voltage-controlled oscillator runs at precisely \n21221 times the uplink carrier frequency. The oscillator frequency goes to the trans-\nmitter which multiplies it by a factor of 120. Therefore, the composite transmitter \ndownlink is 120 x 21221 = 2401221 times the uplink frequency, which is the turn-\naround ratio for NASA-compatible transponders. The turnaround ratio for transpon-\nders compatible with SGLS is 256/205. The two-way-coherent mode allows the \nground station to know more exactly the downlink signal's frequency and to measure \nthe Doppler shift, from which it computes the range rate or line-of-sight velocity \nbetween the spacecraft and the tracking antenna. This knowledge allows operators to \n\n\n\n382 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.2 \n\nTABLE 11\u00b718. What a TT&C Subsystem Does. These are the functions of a communications \nsubsystem connecting the sateDIte to the ground or other sateDItes.

Deep-space \nimaging. data collection. and low-Earth orbit spacecraft best illustrate this advantage. \nThese spacecraft typically have large volumes of data and a short field-of-view time \nto the ground station. To receive maximum data at the ground station on a direct down-\nlink at the spacecraft\u00b7 s highest mte. opemtors must acquire the downlink signal in the \nminimum time. Also. if they use ranging for navigation. t\\ley can calculate range-mte \ninformation from the Doppler shift of the coherent signal. \n\nOccasionally a TT &C subsystem. opemting in the two-way coherent mode. loses \nlock on the uplink signal. At this point. the spacecraft\u00b7s transmitter autonomously \nchanges the references for the downlink carrier from the receiver s voltage-controlled \noscillator to the subsystem's master oscilIator. This process creates a unique downlink \nfrequency which is no longer synchronous with the uplink carrier. This TT&C mode \nis two-way noncoherent communications: \n\nFor the ranging function (i.e .\u2022 determining the range or line-of-sight distance), the \nground station may use the ranging method of navigation to tmck a spacecraft. \n\n11.2 Telemetry, Tracking, and Command 383 \n\nD pending on the communication standard. the ground station modulates a pseudo-\nra:dom code, tones, or both onto the command uplink signal.

From the turnaround time of the ranging code or tones tmveling \n~o and from the spacecraft. the system determines the range.

For certain failure \nscenarios, the subsystem may also execute fault-detection and recovery operations \nthrough a stored software sequence. \n\nTo create a robust TT&C subsystem. we must consider and satisfy three parts of \nsatellite design: requirements, constraints,. and regula~o~. !he ~~ments come \nfrom a variety of sources and form the basIS for the JDlSSlon m which this subsystem \nplays a key role. Typically IT&C requirements include: \n\n\u2022 Type of signals (voice. television, and data) \n\n\u2022 Capacity (number of channels and bandwidth) \n\n\u2022 Covemge area & ground site locations (local. regional, national, international) \n\n\u2022 Link signal strength (usually derived from ground terminal type) \n\n\u2022 Connectivity (crosslinks. relay ground stations. and direct links) \n\n\u2022 Availability (link times per day and days per year, outage times) \n\n\u2022 Lifetime (mission duration) \n\nSee Sec. 11.2.1 for a more thorough discussion of requirements. . \nConstraints are limits on the IT &C subsystem from various sources. Power \n\nconstmints come from sizing the spacecraft and the power source (primary batteries, \nsolar panels and secondary batteries. or mdioisotope thermoelectric generator). Mass \nconstraints arise from the mass budget. which comes from the mission design and the \nchosen launch vehiCle. The launch vehicle generally limits the total dimensions and \nmass. so individual subsystems receive their allocation within those limits. The launch \n\n\n\n384 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.2 \n\nvehicle choice also sets the launch vibration and acoustic environment, which places \nconstraints on the fragility of the subsys~m. The interference environment further \n~onstrains the ~bsystem. When we choose the orbit, we also set the surrounding \nmterference enVlIOllIllent. The owners and developers place cost limits on the total \nd~gn, which in tmn limits each subsystem. These cost constraints typically deter-\nmme how much new technology and subsystem margin that designers can consider. \nMany other constraints may arise during design, depending on the mission and the \npeople involved. \n. ~or the IT &C subsystem, international law.and regulatory agencies impact design \n\nsignificantly. Because all spacecraft commumcate with users and operators on the \nground, de-conflicting frequencies, orbital locations, and power levels are critical to \ncivilized sharing of limited resources. So, we must apply to the regulatory bodies\u00b7 for: \n\n\u2022 Desired communication frequencies (depending on the mission data rate \ntransmission power available, and altitude) , \n\n\u2022 Orbital assignment (further than 2 deg from a satellite with the same fre-\nquency, if geosynchronous) \n\n\u2022 Desired power flux density on surface (depending on our receiver antennas) \n\nThe main regulatory agency enforcing standards is the International Telecommuni-\ncations Union (ITU), which is now part of the United Nations. Within the nu three \nbodies regulate the communication allocations: the Consultative Committee on Inter-\nnational Telephony, the Consultative Committee on International Radiocommu-\nnications, and the International Frequency Registration Board (lFRB). The first two \norganizations formulate policy and set standards. The IFRB coordinates and approves \nfrequency and orbit requests. Because these agencies are international and the number \nof requests is large and growing, we must plan years in advance to get approval for our \ncommunications request. \n\nVarious other bodies exist to assist organizations in coordinating and rationalizing \ncommercial use of the radio frequency spectrum. Three of these are the International \nTelecommunications Satellite Consortium (lNTELSAT), the European Telecommu-\nnications Satellite Consortium (EUfELSAT), and the International Maritime Satellite \nOrganization (lNMARSA T), which assist their member nations with telecommunica-\ntions planning. \n\n11.2.1 RequirementS \n\nThe IT&C subsystem derives its requirements from many sources, such as (1) the \nmission or science objective (top-level requirements such as architecture orbit life-\ntime and environment); (2) the satellite (system-level); (3) the IT &C 'subsystem \n(internal requirements); (4) other satellite subsystems; (5) the ground station and any \nrelay satellite (compatibility); and (6) mission operations (the satellite operational \nmodes as a function of time). From these sources come the requirements that drive the \nsubsystem design: (1) data rates (commands and telemetry for health and status or for \nmissio~ and scien~ needs); (2) ~ta volume; ~3) data storage type; (4) uplink and \ndownlink frequenCies; (5) bandWidths; (6) receive and transmit power; (7) hardware \n~; (8) beam~dth; (9) Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP); and (10) antenna \ngain/system noISe temperature. Table 11-19 shows the effects of these requirements \non the IT &C-subsystem design. \n\n11.2 Telemetry, Tracking, and Command 38S \n\nTABLE 11-19. TT&C Subsystem Requirements.

IT we increase an antenna's aperture size. its gain \nincreases; therefore, we may decrease the transmitter's RF output power and sti1I \nmaintain.the received signal strength. Unfortunately, large antenna apertures are very \nheavy and have narrow beamwidths (producing more stringent pointing require-\nments). As Chap. 13 (Eq. 13-17) shows, the beamwidth decreases with an increase in \n\n\n\n386 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.2 \n\nthe antenna's aperture size. Depending on the frequency and gain needed, we com-\nmonly decide between solid-state and TWT amplifiers-a system-level trade. To do \nso, we must assess the effects' of the sPacecraft's total mass, solar-array size, system \nreliability, and antenna aperture size. Solid-state amplifiers tend to be more reliable, \nlighter, and smaller. TWT amplifiers have a lower technology risk (at higher gains) \nand a higher efficiency. We must use TWTAs when the RF output power requirement \nis too high at a given frequency for solid-state amplifiers, or when the solid-state \namplifier efficiency is too low for our application. At today's technology level, we can \ndesign solid-state amplifiers with power levels of 65 W at UHF frequencies, 40 W at \nS-band, and about 20 W at EHF frequencies. \n\nThe old rule-of-thumb was to keep the satellite as simple as possible by moving all \nthe complexity and processing to the ground. With modem processors, however, we \ncan now do a tremendous amount of processing on a satellite. Thus, we can design for \nlower downlink data rates and simpler ground stations or we can collect more data \nwhile not overburdening the IT &C subsystem. The new trend is to process as much \ninformation as possible on the satellite whenever the mission or science community do \nnot need the raw data. \n\nAt the system level, the IT &C subsystem can interface with a fixed or a mobile \nground station, as well as a relay satellite. Table 11-20 lists examples of these systems. \nWe usually select the system-level interfaces when establishing mission, satellite, and \noperational requirements. \n\nTABLE 11-20. Options for System-Level Interfaces to the TT&C Subsystem. Shown below \nare several interface possibDities for a TT&C subsystem.

Nongunbaled or \nfixed directional'antennas rely on feed arrays for small movements of the antc:~a \nbeaJD or on spacecraft attitude maneuvers for large movements.

The pointing error must be the smaller value of 10% of the half-power \n(-3 dB) beamwidth or 0.3 deg.

The interface must allow the system to receive spacecraft commands \nwhile transmitting real-time telemetry. It also must permit safing of the subsystem and \nautonomous fault detection and correction. \n\nThe interface with the electrical-power subsystem controls the amount and quality \nof spacecraft power to the 1T &C subsystem. One common design has the electrical-\npower subsystem deliver +28 Vdc unregulated to the transponders and other active \nboxes in the 1T&C subsystem and +28 Vdc regulated to the TWTAs. This design \nrequires dc-to-dc converters at each piece of equipment to provide the correct voltage \nchanges. Another interface design centralizes the power conversion and conditiOning, \nf?r the 1T&C subsystem's active elements. However, because TWTAs require spe-\ncific voltage levels (-1,000 Vdc, +1,000 Vdc, and +4,000 Vdc,), centralized power \nconversion and conditioning is not very common with those types of amplifiers. \n\nThe payload interface mainly transfers mission or science telemetry data to either \nthe ground station or a relay satellite. To characterize this interface we must know the \ndata rate, data volume, and any data storage requirements. This interface may have to \ncouple signals between the payload and the 1T &C subsystem and to modulate the \npayload telemetry. \n\nTable 11-22 gives a design process for the 1T&C subsystem. Once we state the \nperfonnance parameters for 1T &C and identify the ground and spacebome equip-\nment, we use the methods in Chap. 13 to determine overall performance of the \ncommunication links. We must iterate this process many times within the design team \nto attain an acceptable spacecraft weight, configuration, and perfonnance level. \n\nTABLE 11-22.

Very high \nSidelobe sidelobes may Interfere with other antennes and receivers on the satellite. High \nLevels sidelobe levels also affect security by making detection of signals more likely. \n\npolarization Polarizations can be circular (right or left), or linear (horizontal or vertical). To \ndecrease signa/loss In the link, the polarizations need to be compatible. For \nexample, the sateUite antenna and ground station must both have rlght-circular \npolarization. \n\nFrequency When we need to acquire the signal quickly, the receiver frequency must be \nStabl11/y known and stable. Thus, we specify the original receiver frequency's set point, \n\nshort-term stability, temperature stability, and aging stability so we can acquire \nthe uplink signal with little uncertainty. \n\nCapture and The capture range is the bend of frequencies over which the upllnk-carrler signal \nTracking can drift from the receiver's best-lock frequency, so the receiver will stlJllock to \nRange the uplink signal. The tracking range is the band of frequencies the receiver will \n\nfollow while locked to a sweeping, upllnk-carrler signal without losing lock. \nTypically the capture range is 1 % of the tracking range. \n\nDip/axer The diplexer allows us to use the same antenna for transmitting and receMng. \nIsolation The diplexer Isolates the transmitter from the receiver. A dlplexer with low \n\nIsolation may require a band-reject fiiter between the transmitter and the dlplexer. \n\nCoupUng Signal and noise coupling between a transmitting antenna and a receMng \nBetween antenna may cause the receMng antenna to lock onto a frequency coming from \nAntennas the transmitting antenna's transmitter. More commonly, broadband noise from \n\nthe transmitting antenna may couple over to the receMng antenna and raise the \nnoise fioor of the receMng antenna's receiver, reducing the slgnal-ta-noIse ratio. \n\nAs Table 11-24 shows, selection criteria for 1T&C subsy~tems fall ~to three \ncategories: performance, compatibility, and other. Performance: IS th~ most ~p?rtant \nselection criterion. This subsystem's hardware must meet specifications of~~ \nperformance to close the communication link with an ?'7eptable signal-t~n~ ra~o. \nThe Bit Error Rate (HER) is a Figure of Merit for the digI~ p~ o~the C?mmum~tion \nlink. It is the probability that a bit sent over the commumcation link will be ~lVed \nincorrectly. We typically specify this rate to be 1 x IQ-6 for the command uplink .and \n1 x 10-5 for the telemetry downlink, depending on the nature of the data. To achieve \nthis rate, the system must meet certain techni~ specifications: RF power output for \nthe transmitter, receiver-noise figure, stable oscillator frequency, and the TT&C sub-\nsystem's front-end losses and antenna gains. \n\nCompatibility is an important selection criterion when the 1T &C subsystem must \ncommunicate with existing systems. If the 1T &C subsystem must talk to the ground \nstations in the Space Oround Link System (SOLS), then the tranSponder must be com-\npatible with SOLS. Likewise, if it must talk to the Tracking ~d D~ Relay Satellite \nSystem (TDRSS), the cross-link transponder must be compatible With TDRSS. \n\n\n\n390 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.2 \n\nTABLE 11-24.

Typically, we measure heritage in terms of \nprevious spaceflight experience. A lot of communication hardware meets all three \nselection criteria. A typical SOLS transponder (1) can close the links to the ground \nstations With an acceptable bit error rate, (2) is compatible with the ground stations in \nthe SOLS, and (3) has flown before. \n\nFigure 11-4 diagrams a generic TT &C subsystem. A typical subsystem contains \ntwo transponders (for redundancy). The transmitter (downlink) path is as follows. \nFrom the left side of Fig. 11-4, two digital bit streams enter the transponder. One enters \neither from data storage or real-time from the payload. The other stream comes from \ncommand and data handling with telemetry data on health and status. These two data \nstreams are modulated onto subcarriers, which are then modulated onto the carrier \noutput. The composite signal is then amplified and routed out of the transponder and \nthrough a low-pass filter. The filter reduces second and higher-order harmonics to \ndecrease frequency spurs and intermodulation products from the spacecraft's receiver. \nFrom the filter, the composite signal travels through a band-reject filter; a double-pole, \ndouble-throw (transfer or 2P2T) RF switch; a dip1exer; and finally to the antenna \nwhere it radiates to the ground station. The band-reject filter is a notch filter that \nattenuates frequencies coming from the transmitter and falling within the receiver's \npass band. This filtering action further isolates the transmitter and receiver signals. \nThe RF switch selects transmitter A or B and antenna A or B. The diplexer allows a \ntransmitter and receiver to share the same antenna. It also isolates the transmitter from \nthe receiver port at the receiver's center frequency, so the transmitter doesn't lock, \njam, or damage the receiver. \n\n11.2 \n\nData \nStorage TIm \n\nC&DH TIm \n\nC&DHCmds \n\nData \nStorage TIm \n\nC&DH TIm \n\nC&DHCmds \n\nTelemetry, Tracking, and Command 3~1 \n\nPower \n\n~ \n\nCmd TIm \nC&DH \n\nFIg. 11-4. Block Diagram of a Generic Tr&C Subsystem. This subsystem has fuD redun-\ndancy: two transponders with paraDel transmit and receive signal paths. The d1plexer \nallows the same antenna to be used for transmitting and receMng. The band-reJect \nfilter attenuates spurious signals originating from the transmitter at the receiver's \ncenter frequency to help the d1plexer Isolate the receiver from the transmitter. \n\nThe receiver's uplink path is as follows. First, we assume the equipment modulates \nthe digital command data onto a subcarrier and further modulates the subcarrier onto \nthe uplink-carrier frequency to form a composite uplink signal. Then, from the ~ght of \nFig. 11-4, the composite signal enters the subsystem through the antenna. The diplexer \nroutes the composite signal to the receiver RF switch, which then selects antenna A or \nB and receiver A or B. The composite signal travels through the receiver's low-pass \nfilter, which rejects unwanted transmitter harmonics and freq~ency spurs that ~y \nexist above the diplexer's stop band. The signal then moves mto the transponder s \nreceiver, which demodulates it and routes the digital-command bit stream to the \ncommand and data handling subsystem. \n\nFigure 11-5 diagrams a typical transponder. The composite uplink signal enters the \nreceiver where the command data stream is demodulated from the carrier and subcar-\nrier.

We mount all ground-link antennas to provide an unobstructed \nview of Earth and place cross-link antennas to provide an unobstructed view of the \nrelay satellite. Historically, the TT&C subsystem's electronics are as close to the \nantennas as possible. If we gimbal the antennas, we must make sure the satellite's \nbody or other appendages such as the solar arrays do not obscure the antenna's field \nof view. \n\nSpin-stabilized satellites are usually cylindrical, and commonly contain a despun \nsection. Except for omnidirectional varieties, we must mount antennas on the despun \nsection. Frequently. we put the RF components and associated electronics on the \ndespun section to avoid passing RF signals through rotary joints. \n\nFrom a TT&C point of view, satellites in LEO or in geosynchronous orbit are \nsimilar. The primary differences are the path losses. We compensate for these losses \nwith either antenna gain or transmitter power. An interesting case involves an antenna \nbeam providing spot communication from a LEO spacecraft for an area of the Earth. \nAs the satellite ranges away from the coverage area, the antenna beamwidth to cover \nthe area decreases. The increased antenna gain resulting from the narrow beamwidth \ncompensates for the path loss based on the inverse square law. The longer distance \ndemands no added transmitter power. \n\nTable 11-25 summarizes five ways we can apply a TT&C subsystem.

See Sec. 13.3.5 \n\n11.3 \nCommand and Data Handling 395 \n\n11.3 Command and Data Handling \n\nRichard T. Berget, BF Goodrich Aerospace \nData Systems Division \n\nThe command and data handling system, C&DH, performs two major functions. It \nreceiVes, validates, decodes, and distributes commands to other spacecraft systems \nand gathers, processes, and fonnats spacecraft housekeeping and niission data for \ndownlink or use by an onboard computer. This equipment often includes additional \nfunctions, such as spacecraft timekeeping, computer health monitoring (watchdog), \nand security interfaces. \n\nWhile they normally provide independent functions, the combination of command \nand data handling into a single subsystem provides an efficient means for autonomous \ncontrol of spacecraft functions. An onboard computer or microprocessor can send \ncommands and monitor telemetry over a single interface with the C&DH system, \nallowing the control of multiple subsystems. \n\nThe C&DH system's size is directly proportional to spacecraft complexity. The \nmore systems a spacecraft has, the more monitoring and configuration capability \nrequired. Reliability concerns alone may double the hardware's size if we require \nredundant C&DH subsystems. \n\nThe ideal C&DH systeln is one which has been proven on another spacecraft and \nwhich requires no modification for the mission under development. However, new \nmissions are usually supported by systems which evolve from older designs. We make \nsmall improvements in the perfonnance of the systems from the viewpoint of speed. \npower, weight, volume, or other operating parameter. In the case of a new or custom \ndesign, extensive testing must simulate the strenuous environments involved in a \nspace launch and flight. \n\n11.3.1 Introduction to C&DH \n\nFigure 11-6 shows a typical command decoder. Command messages can originate \nfrom an onboard computer, uplink transponders, or a hardline test interface. An \narbitration scheme is necessary for source selection which gives uplink commands \npriority. Commands from the computer are delayed until a time slot is available. The \nhardline test interface is not active during flight and when in use overrldesthe other \ncommand sources. \n\nSeveral standards exist for command message formats. (See CCSDS 201.0-B-l, \n1987.) Typically, a command consists of a synchronization code, spacecraft address \nbits, command message bits, and error check bits. Received commands are validated \nprior to execution. Validation consists of receiving synchronization code, checking \ncommand message length (correct number of bits), exactly matching the spacecraft \naddress and any fixed-bit patterns (unused message bits), and detecting no errors in an \nerror check polynomial code. Once the decoder validates a command, it increments a \ncounter to record the number of executed commands. Then the message bits pass to a \ndecoder for execution. The command decoder rejects commands that do not pass the \nvalidation criteria and it increments the command reject counter. The data handling \nsystem reads the accept and the reject counters and includes them in the downlink data \nto provide operational feedback. \n\n\n\n396 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.3 \n\nCOmmand \nSources Command Outputs r-----------------------I \n\n1 1 \n1 ~ Pulse \n1 'I \n\nCommand Command \nSource Message 1 Pulse \n\nArbitration Validation 1'---__ ---' \n1 \n1 \n\nr--=-'7-:-~ Data \n\n1 VoHage 1 \n1 Command Detect 1 \n\nClock \n'--7--~ Enable \n\n1-~~ ___________ .. ________ I \n\nAg.11-6. Command Decoder Block Diagram. \n\nPrime \nPower \n\nThe command decoder determines command output type and the specific interface \nchannel. A typical system provides two types of output: discrete and serial. Discrete \ncommands are a fixed amplitude and a fixed pulse duration and consist of two basic \ntypes: \n\n\u2022 High-Level Discrete Command: A +28 V, 10 to 100 ms pulse used to drive a \nlatching relay coil or fire an ordnance device. \n\n\u2022 Low-Level Discrete Command: An open collector or 5 V pulse typically inter-\nfacing with digital logic. \n\nA serial command is a 3-signal interface consisting of a shift clock, serial command \ndata. and a data enable used to indicate the interface is active. A portion of the received \ncommand message bits (typically 8 or 16) is sent in serial form to a user subsystem. \n\nThe terms data handling and telemetry are often used interchangeably. However, \ndata handling is more than just telemetry. IEEE Standard 100 offers this definition of \ntelemetry: \n\nTelemetering (remOte metering). Measurement with the aid of intermediate \nmeans that permit the measurement to be interpreted at a distance from the \nprimary detector. The distinctive feature of telemetering is the nature of the \ntranslating means, which includes provision for converting the measurand \ninto a representative quantity of another kind that can be transmitted con-\nveniently for measurement at a distance. ,The actual distance is irrelevant. \n\nData handling combines telemetry from multiple sources and provides it for \ndownlink or internal spacecraft use. Figure 11-7 illustrates a typical spacecraft data-\nhandling unit \n\nMost data handling systems are of the time-division multiplexed type. These \nsystems sequence through their inputs in a predetermined order, then organize them in \na fixed output format Other systems process inputs as lists of data samples and/or \nallow random access by an onboard computer. Input signal sampling rate is \ndetennined by signal bandwidth. Sample rate must be a minimum of two times the \n\n11.3 Command and Data Handling 397 \n\nMultiplexed \nSignal ,- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - ~ \nInputs , \n\n;: J I ~ BI-Ievel 1-\"'-----1 \n\n, \n\nData \nFormatter \n\nand \nControl \nLogic \n\n, , \n\n, , L ________________________________________ _ \n\nFig. 11-7.

Da~ from all mputs IS c~nverted to digItal.form and \nformatted into a serial stream of continuous data for downlink. The data rate IS the sum \nof all input sample rates plus some bandwidth for insertion of synchro~on ~es \nand a frame identification counter. IRIG Standard 106, Chap. 4, proVIdes a detajled \ndiscussion of downlink telemetry formats and associated format terms. \n\nThe data handling system may also supply telemetry to an onboard computer. The \ncomputer sends its request to the data handling system which processes the input and \nreturns telemetry data. This operation is interleaved with downlink telemetry gather-\ning which is usually continuous. \n\nAnalog telemetry data comes to the data handling equipment in many forms. Often, \ndirect transducer outputs require signal conditioning prior to conversion from analog \nto digital form. Data handling hardware is simplified, however, when input signals are \npreconditioned or fall in the general categories described below. \n\n\u2022 High-Level Analog: A telemetry channel with information encoded as an \nanalog voltage, typically in the range of 0 to 5.2 V. These are active analog \ninputs in that the command and data handling system does not provide \nmeasurement excitation. Data handling equipment converts this information to \ndigital form. \n\n\u2022 Low-Level Analqg: A telemetry channel with information encoded as an \nanalog voltage. The signal range is low enough to require amplification before \nthe information is encoded into digital form. Typical gain values fall between \n100 to 300. Because of the signal's low voltage range, it is subject to noise \ncontamination and thus uses an interface in which the telemetry information is \nthe difference between signal and reference inputs to the command and data \nhandling system. This is differential or double-ended interface. \n\n\n\n398 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.3 \n\n\u2022 Passive Analog: A telemetry channel with information encoded as a resis-\ntance. The command and data handling system supplies a constant current to \nthe resistive sensor and encodes the resulting IR voltage drop into a digital \nword. \n\nAll analog telemetry is converted to digital form within the command and data \nhandling system. The system determines data resolution by the number of quantization \nlevels. More information on this topic may be found in Chap. 13. \n\nThe two most common forms of digital telemetry data are described below: \n\u2022 Bi-Level (Discrete) Input: A telemetry channel conveying two state infor-\n\nmation (such as on/off or enable/disable). Information is encoded as voltages, \nbut may be encoded as a resistance or the presence or absence of a signal. \nTypically a logic 0 = 0 to 1 V, and a logic 1 = 3 V to 5 V (or 3 V to 28 V). \n\n\u2022 Serial Telemetry (Digital) Interface: A 3-signal interface used to transfer \ndigital data from an external source to the data handling equipment. The \ncommand and data' handling system provides a shift clock and an interface \nenable signal to control data transfer. Interface circuits may be differential line \ndrivers or single ended. Serial rather than parallel interfaces are preferred on \nspacecraft, because they simplify cable design and require fewer interface \ncircuits. \n\n11.3.2 C&DH System Sizing Process \n\nTable 11-27 summarizes the command and data handling subsystem estimating \nprocess. The desired output of this process is a reasonable estimate of the hardware \nnecessary to support the mission including estimate of its size, weight, and power. Use \nthis table in conjunction with Tables 11-28 and 11-29 to assist in estimating the system \nparameters in the case of unknowns. The results may then be fed back into the mission \ndesign process and adjusted as necessary. FrreSat has been used as an example to \nillustrate the process and highlight the main points of estimating when the majority of \nneeded inputs are unknown or flexible. \n\nStep I-Identify Fnnctions to be Performed by the C&DH System. The first \nstep in baseJining the command and data handling system is to define the primary \nfunctional requirements needed to monitor and control the spacecraft. At a minimum, \nmost missions require command processing and housekeeping data acquisition. The \nsize and complexity of these two systems is determined by the spacecraft design, the \ntechnical requirements, and additional functions and subsystems supported. \n\nCommand Processing \n\nThere are three primary considerations for baselining a command decoder: \n\u2022 The number of command output channels \n\n\u2022 Any requirement for stored commands \n\n\u2022 Any requirement for computer commands or ACS functions \n\nTable 11-28, gives guidelines for channel counts and sizing. As the spacecraft \ndesign evolves, we refine the needed quantities and types of channels. Whenever \npossible, interfaces to the C&DH system should be standardized as a means of saving \ncost, but this is not mandatory. The C&DH system is an excellent place to put space-\ncraft functions that do not seem to fit anywhere else. \n\n11.3 \n\nJ! \n\nJ \nJ \nI!! \nIi: \n\nCommand and Data Handling \n\n\n\n400 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.3 \n\nw~ must ~l~de the. capability to ~tore commands if we require spacecraft control \nwh~ I~ n~t m VIew of Its ground stations. or as a means of recovery if the communi-\n~tion link IS lost These commands may be controlled by matching a time-tag or b \nsImple delay counter from a controlled timing event Stored commands of this ~ \nmay be easily implemented without a general-purpose processor. . \n\nWe must add an onboard computer if we require a decision-making element on th \nspacecraft. ~~ we es!Bblish the need for a computer, we can plan to use it to perfon: \nmany functions ~cluding the stored command capability, attitude control algorithms \n~d da~ processmg and sto~ge .. lntegrating at.titude control with the command syste~ \nwill typica1ly add some spectal mterface reqwrements for driving control elements. \nTelemetry Processing \n\nThe data handling system provides the ability to acquire data for: \n\n\u2022 Spacecraft housekeeping data (health and status) \n\n\u2022 Feedback for onboard control of spacecraft functions \n\n\u2022 Routing of payload or subsystem data to and from receivers and transmitters \nstorage or affected system controllers ' \n\n\u00b7 Th.e quan~ty of telemeay input chan~els required for monitoring spacecraft health \nIS typIcally ~uectly p~porti~nal to the Size, complexity, and quantity of payloads and \nsubsystems mvolved m meeting the primary and secondary missions. The majority of \nthese channels are standard interfaces to temperature, pressure, and voltage trans-\ndu~rs. Som~ su.bsystems provide the ability to monitor their own health and integrate \nthe ~ormation mto a data stream. For new subsystems, the awareness of what the data \nhandling system ~an ~o for them may prevent an unusual de$ign or duplication of a \nlarge amount of CIrCWtry. \n\u00b7 The data handling system may acquire payload or subsystem data also. Of critical \nImportan~e to the system design is the quantity of data and its transfer rate. The telem-\netry acqwred for spacecraft health is limited in speed due to the time necessary to \naccurately convert analog signals to digital information. If a subsystem or payload data \nstream exceeds 2~ kbps or is greater than a few thousand bits in size, it is usually \nn~ to proVIde data b~ers or to process the data in a separate section of the data \nhandlIng system. Often, an mterleaver may be provided to integrate and synchronize \nthe health and payload data into a single stream. \n\nIf an onboa:d computer is available, it may require additional signa1s to perform its \n!BS~. These SIgnalS may not be needed in the downlink telemetry format Therefore, \n~t IS usually preferable for the computer to have the capability to request data \nmdependently of the preprogrammed downlink format The computer may also be \nused. to preprocess subsystem and health data to reduce the downlink bandwidth \nreqwrement. (See Chap. 16 for a discussion of onboard processing.) \nOther Functions \n\n\u00b7 Tim~. ~ost space~ designs require the availability of a time word (universal \n~e, mISSIOn ~lapsed ~me, or delay) for support of attitude control, stored command-\nmg, . or data time-ta~g. ~everal systems can provide this time, including GPS \nreceIVers, computer-mamtained counters, and hardware timers. The most critical \nparameters for the definition of this function are: \n\n\u2022 Time word granularity \n\n11.3 Command and Data HaodHng 401 \n\n\u2022 Stability requirement \n\n\u2022 Acceptable uncertainty \n\nGranularity defines the smallest increments of time maintained for use on the \nspacecraft or of interest on the ground. This value is usually driven by the accuracy of \ntime needed for data time-tagging or the attitude control system. Typically this is one \nmillisecond or one microsecond. Over specifying this value will increase the hardware \nrequired. increase the cost, and decrease the available bandwidth for data. IRIG-B time \ncode generators transmit a I-sec resolution time word and a I-MHz oscillator to allow \nthe user to create their own smaller granularity time. \n\nThe aging characteristics of the primary oscillator, which drives the timing system, \ndetermines the drift characteristics of the time word. Oscillators are typica1ly specified \nby long-term and short-term stability in parts per million (ppm) over a given time. \nSelection of this stability determines the allowable error in the onboard time between \ntime updates from the ground. The same stable oscillator may be used to provide other \noscillator frequencies to other spacecraft subsystems. Occasionally, the stability \nneeded by the other system may be the driving factor. \n\nMaintaining time with the spacecraft computer is possible using internal registers \nand a periodic interrupt signal. However, additional uncertainty may be induced due \nto the nonsynchronous nature of a processor under interrupt control. Higher priority \ninterrupts may delay the update of the time word. If other subsystems need a time base, \nthe designer must include additional registered circuitry. \n\nComputer Watchdog. When a spacecraft computer is used to provide decision-\nmaking capability on orbit, it is common to provide a method of determining a \ncomputer failure independent of the processor itself. This function may be integrated \ninto the C&DH system and is usually referred to as the watchdog timer. \n\nThe watchdog timer ensures that the computer hardware and software functions as \nplanned. A hardware or software anomaly could be catastrophic to the spacecraft \nmission if we don't provide a means of correcting the problem. Typica1ly, this function \nuses one or more timers which must be reset by the onboard computer prior to timing \nout The computer resets the timer by writing a specific data word to a specific address. \nIf this is not accomplished prior to the time-out, the watchdog will execute a predeter-\nmined recovery action. The recovery may be a computer reset, interrupt, or a disable \nwhich is maintained until cleared by a ground command. \n\nAttitude Control System Functions. Integrating attitude control functions into the \nC&DH system may reduce the hardware required on the spacecraft by taking advan-\ntage of C&DH circuitry that is available in other subsystems. The integration of \ncommand, telemetry and onboard computer functions allows closed-loop monitoring \nand control with the addition of interface channels specific to the attitude control \nfunction. These channels may be high current, high accuracy, or other special require-\nment interfaces. In some cases, the attitude control section provides only controlling \nsignals. with the high power and signal conditioning circuitry integrated into the \nattitude control component \n\nSpares. As the baseJining process continues, we develop an estimate of the 110 \nchannel quantities, and use this estimate in step 3 to estimate system parameters. \nUnfortunately, 110 channel quantities tend to increase, as the spacecraft becomes more \ndefined. 'nterefore, it is common practice to include 10% to 25% additional channels in \nthe count for unforeseen growth requirements. We should use the chaImel count, \nincluding spares, to estimate system complexity in Table 11-28. This estimate must be \n\n\n\n402 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.3 \n\ndocumented carefully to prevent several increases as the concept proceeds through the \nvarious departments and levels of management involved in the spacecraft design. As \nalways, more hardware increases the cost, size, weight, and power of the system. \n\nStep 2-Identify Reqnirements and COnstraints. Once the functions required by \nthe command and data handling system have been determined, requirements and \nconstraints imposed by external factors must be identified. We don't control these \nrequirements and constraints and they may affect one or more aspects of the C&DH \nsystem design. Early identification and response to these issues may minimize the cost \nimpact and design problems. \n\nSpacecraft Bus Constraints. The physical size of a spacecraft and its design will \noften direct the ultimate configuration of the command and data handling system. In \ngeneral, the C&DH system may be divided into three classes or architectures: \n\n\u2022 Single-unit systems \n\n\u2022 Multiple-unit, distributed systems \n\n\u2022 Integrated systems \n\n. A single-unit C&DH system provides one unit for the command system and one \nurnt for the telemetry system or a single unit which integrates both functions. Although \nthe single-unit design may be simple and centralize functions, it can have a significant \ndisadvantage on a medium to large spacecraft bus. As mentioned previously, a larger \nspacecraft will generally require a larger number of subsystems and associated inter-\nfaces and health monitors. A single-unit system requires every interface wire to be \nrouted to a single physical location for monitoring and control. The result can be a wire \nharness that is larger than the unit itself and significantly impacts the weight budget \n\nMultiple-unit C&DH systems provide a potential solution to this problem and \nothers. A inultiple-unit system provides \"remote\" command and data handling capa-\nbilities in locations physically removed from the \"central\" unit The number of \nremotes is driven by the spacecraft bus design or the quantity of I/O channels. One \nexample is the design of a dual-spin satellite in which every signal must be transferred \nbetween the spinning and fixed sections of the satellite over a slip-ring interface. Slip \nrings limit the quantities of signals which may be practically routed and also compli-\ncate the design due to induced noise. One practical solution is to provide a remote unit \non the spinning side which communicates with the central unit over a digital data bus. \nThis allows the acquisition of hundreds of channels on the spinning side while requir-\ning only 2 to 6 wires to pass through the slip rings. \n\nIntegrated C&DH systems typically combine command, telemetry, flight process-\ning, :md.attitude. control in~ one system. These s~stems tend to be small LightSat-type \napplIcations which use a smgle computer to momtor and control the satellite or a large \nhigh-performance system which uses multiple computers and subsystems coordinated \nby a central high-power processor. This type of system may provide a reduced hard-\nware requirement and cost due to the increased capability provided by the processor. \nHowever, this system will most likely entail increased software costs associated with \nthe increased programming requirements. \n\n~e~iIity. The reliability required of the C&DH system will affect the system \ndesIgn m two areas: redundancy and parts quality. A low failure rate for the system \nprovides a high confidence factor in the success of the mission. Reliability is dramat-\nically increased by including a redundant system for all mission-critical components. \nConfiguring a system in this manner will obviously increase the amount of hardware \n\n11.3 Command and Data Handling 403 \n\ninvolved. More hardware means increasing the recurring cost, but not necessarily \ndouble the total procurement cost Many cost items involved in manufacturing the \nsystem are fixed whether a single-string or redundant system is built \n\nParts quality also affects the reliability of a system. Increasing the parts quality does \nnot increase the amount of hardware; however, it does significantly increase cost \nspecifying a Class \"S\" parts program (or indirectly requiring it via the reliability \nrequirement) typically multiplies the material cost by 400% to 500%. \n\nRadiation. The areas affected most by the radiation requirement are cost and \nschedule. System size and weight may be affected if we require shielding of elec~nic \ncomponents. A radiation environment limits the part ~ av~able to .th~ ~gn~ \nand system performance is typically lower due to required delating. Predicting ClICWt \nbehavior is accomplished by modeling, simulation, and analysis. Environment sever-\nity may double system development time and increase parts costs by a factor of 10. \n\nrrogriun Constraints. The foundation of any hardware development program lies \nin the constraints placed upon the program to carry out the mission. In some cases, \nprogram constraints initially restrict a design so the desired mission cannot be accom-\nplished. The budget allocated for the program ~ typically be the most limiting ~\u00ad\nstraint in the development of the spacecraft and, m tum, command and data handling \u2022 \nAllocating a budget for a LightSat will clearly preclude developing a spacecraft and \nsupport systems for a national-asset satellite. \n\nIf managers define a budget, it will become the primary driver in determining the \nother elements of the definition process. In the case of a preliminary study, the objec-\ntive may be to define the budget needed to achieve the desired mission goals. In this \ncase, the later steps become the determinant and the dollars needed become the output \nof the process. \n\nThe second significant program constraint is commonly schedule. Most space-\nqualifJed electronic systems are custom designs or semi custom implementations of \nexisting hardware. The need dates for hardware may completely determine which \napproach we take to develop hardware. Typical lead times for command and data \nhandling equipment are 12 to 18 months for systems using Class B parts and 24 to 30 \nmonths for systems using Class S parts. These schedule times are almost completely \ndriven by the lead time involved in the procurement of electronic piece parts. There-\nfore, a fast delivery requirement to support an urgent mission will affect the parts and \nreliability level of the unit \n\nStep 3-Determine the Complexity of C&DH Fnnctions. Table 11-28 may be \nused to provide a fJrst-order estimate of the complexity.of each C&DH function. There \nare no absolutes in this stage of the process. The estimate is the result of the C&DH \n\"feel\" obtained by comparing known general requirements with those listed in the \ntable. The result is a bounding of the system definition into one of three zones. We \nmust define C&DH system drivers which may move the components between zones \nin the case of an unclear definition. Once a determination is made on the function \ncomplexities, steps 4 and 5 provide an estimate of the system size, weight, and power \nspecifications. As can be seen in the FireSat example, all the requirements do not have \nto be defined to make a fJrst-order estimate. \n\nStep 4-Determine Overall C&DH Level of Complexity. Functions described as \n\"other\" are now collected into the command and telemetry components. Typically, the \nmission time clock is included in the telemetry component The computer watchdog is \nincluded in the command component because a computer failure often requires space-\ncraft reconfiguration via the command system. ACS functions are included in both. \n\n\n\n, I \n\n: ,i \n\n404 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.3 \nI I \n\n~ 8 \n= Ii iiI: s~ ~ EO i~ 8) ~ ~ ~Q)2 ::len \nic1 i \"'.>0: i ~j 0\"'1: .l!l CD= e I:=s .l!l ~ ~ ~~IIS .l!l0 ii: .\u00a7 ~ ~ CD-\"D ~ ~ Q.\"D en 0 Ela \n\n~ \ni \n..c: \n2CD =-\n\n~ \ncj \no~ \n\n~ !\u00a7 C\\lQ! \n~ \n\ncb- C c \ne.g ~.9 =-GI ..

The F'treSat example appears to be satisfied with a \"simple\" system \napproach with one exception. The high-speed payload data requirement must be \naddresSed to prevent this requirement from becoming the system design driver. The \nimpact must be evaluated for the mission design. Potential solutions include a sep-\narate data link, onboard data compression to reduce bandwidth, and additional \nresearch to determine if the 150 Mbps requirement is really needed to accomplish the \n\nmission. \nThe reliability requirement specified for F'treSat causes a significant impact on the \n\nsystem design and cost. To achieve the desired rating, the systems must be configured \nredundantly and manufactured using Class S parts. This information. its impact and \nalternatives, should be fed back into the mission design process as early as possible . \n\nStep S-Estimate Size, Weight, and Power for Each Component. The results of \nsteps 3 and 4 may now be used in conjunction with Table 11-29 to obtain an estimate \nof the system parameters. The \"feel\" of the system or the desired design margin will \ndetermine the selected value within each zone. \n\nTABLE 11-29. Parametric EstImatIon of. C&DH Size, Weight, and Power.

The baselining process presented provides \nthe mission designer with an approach to making a first-order estimate of the necessary \nhardware based upon previous hardware developments. This approach will provide a \nrealistic estimate to be used in mission resource budgeting. \n\nIt is important to identify the rationale and drivers for the baseline. If possible, each \nspecification should be allocated a rating or confidence factor to indicate if the speci-\nfication is required, flext'ble, or merely a place holder. This information may allow the \nmission design team more creativity in solving a given technical problem. \n\n\n\nI, \nI \n\n406 Spacecraft Subsystems 1I-3 \n\n11.3.3 C&DH Basics \nThis section is a list of details of great concern to command and data handling \n\nsystem. d~ign and opera~on. Many of these concems are of absolute necessity when \nd~tc:nrunmg C&DH reqwrements and generating procurement specifications. Empha-\nSIS. IS :placed on the command system because of the severity of the effects if these \nguIdelines are not followed. Data handling basics such as data rates and the number of \nbits per sample are covered in Sec. 13.2. \n. Interfaces to other equipment must be protected so that their faults do not propagate \nmto the command decoder. \n\nIt is paramount that no commands or any transient signals appear on command \noutputs during application or removal of prime power, or during under lover prime \npower voltage conditions. \n\nIt is a basic philosophy of command decoder designs that if the integrity of a \nc?mmand message. is in doubt, the command is not issued. It is rejected! This is espe_ \nCIally true when firing an ordnance device or the spacecraft is launched from a manned \nvehicle. It is for this reason that received command messages are not corrected, \nalthough the capability exists, using error check bits. \n\nF?r safetr concerns, operations such as firing ordnance, an engine, or thruster, \n~wre multiple commands configured in series forming a logical AND function. No \nsIngle command causes the operation to occur. In a typical ordnance application, three \ncommands are required: safe, arm, and fire. In this case, safe and arm are relays that . \ne~ab!e a high level discrete command, fire. The commands .must (shall) be isolated \n~!hi\u00bb the command decoder such that no single component or physical failure results \nI? Inadvertent function execution. To achieve this, the Hamming distance of control-\nlIng command messages must be two or greater (for isolation in the decoding scheme) \nand command outputs must be physically isolated to the greatest extent possible usin~ \ndifferent decoding circuits and interface connectors. -\n\n. It is advi~ not to have any commands that turn a command decoder off during \nflIght In addition, there should be no commands that interrupt the uplink source to the \ncommand decoder. \n. In.redun~t applications, where command outputs are cross strapped, the interface \n\nCJrC~ts an~ Interconnection hav~ to be designed such that no single component or \nphYSICal failure prevents the active output from functioning. Along the same lines \n\",,:he~ tele~try inputs a.nd serial interface outputs are cross strapped, the interfa~ \nCIrC~ts an~ Interconnections. have to be designed such that no single component or \nphYSIcal failure prevents the Interface from functioning. \n\nTh~ ri~ing .and falling edges of discrete command and serial telemetry outPuts are \noften lImIted In frequency content so that they are not a source of noise emissions on \nthe spacecraft \n\n11.3.4 A Fmal Note \n\nThe C&DH subsystem is often one of the last on the spacecraft to be defined. It is \na tool, used to configure, control, or program the payload and other spacecraft \nsubsystems. It is the spacecraft's senses reporting internal environment, health and \nstatus information. C&DH equipment cannot be completely defined until the rec{uire-\nments of other systems have been established. The mission designer's main task is that \n~f listing the c.ommand, telemetry and other data needs for each spacecraft system. The \nlISt must also Include the rate at which commands are issued and telemetry is gathered \nfor determination of composite data rates. Issues such as data format, encoding, and \n\n11.4 Power 407 \n\nsecurity must then be addressed. At this point it may be advantageous to stop and take \nan overall view of the spacecraft for other functions, which if included in the C&DH, \nwould simplify overall design. Remember that the C&DH interfaces to nearly all \nspacecraft functions. Next the impact of the mission environments, duration and \nrequired reliability on the C&DH hardware is assessed. When these tasks are complete \nthe C&DH subsystem can be fully characterized. \n\n11.4 Power \n\nJoseph K. McDermott, Lockheed Martin Astronautics \n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 11-8, the electrical power subsystem (EPS) provides, stores, \ndistributes, and controls spacecraft electrical power. Table 11-30 lists typical functions \nperformed by the EPS. The most important sizing requirements are the demands for \naverage and peak electrical power and the orbital profile (inclination and altitude). We \nmust identify the electrical power loads for mission operations at beginning-oJ-life. \nBOL, and end-oJ-life, EOL. \n\nFor many missions, the end-of-life power demands must be reduced to compensate \nfor solar array performance degradation. The average electrical power needed at EOL \ndetermines the size of the power source. Section 10.3 shows a sample power budget \nthat we may use to begin the sizing process. We usually multiply average power by 2 \nor 3 to obtain peak power requirements for attitude control, payload, thermal, and EPS \n(when charging the batteries). Fortunately, all the systems do Jiot require peak power \nat the same time during the mission. \n\nI E1ectrlca1 Power Subsystem I \nI \n\nRg.11-8.

Launch vehicles \n\nsuch as Titan IV or Delta use primary batteries (discussed in Sec. 11.4.2) as the power \nsource for electrical loads because the batteries usually need to last less than an hour. \nBut batteries alone are too massive for missions that last from weeks to years. These \nmissions need a source that can generate power over many orbital cycles to support \nelectrical loads and recharge the batteries. \n\nTypically, we use four types of power sources for spacecraft. Photovoltaic solar \ncells, the most common power source for Earth-orbiting spacecraft, convert incident \nsolar radiation directly to electrical energy. Static power sources use a heat source \n_typically plutonium-238 or uranium-235 (nuclear reactor), for direct thermal-to-\nelectric conversion. Dynamic power sources also use a heat source-typically concen-\ntrated solar radiation, plutonium-238, or enriched uranium-to produce electrical \npower using the Brayton, Stirling, or Rankine cycles. The fourth power source is fuel \ncells, used on manned space missions such as Gemini, Apollo, SkyLab, and the Space \nShuttle. Table 11-33 provides a comparison of various power sources. \n\nStatic power conversion uses either a thermoelectric or a thermionic concept. The \nmost common static power source for spacecraft is the thermoelectric couple. This \nbasic converter uses the temperature gradient between the p-n junction of individual \nthermoelectric cells connected in a series-parallel arrangement to provide the desired \ndc electrical output from each converter. This temperature gradient comes from slow \ndecay of the radioactive source. The thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency for a \nthermoelectric source istypica1ly 5-8%. \n\nThermionic energy conversion produces electricity through a hot electrode (emit-\nter) facing a cooler electrode (collector) inside a sealed enclosure that typically \ncontains an ionized gas. Electrons emitted from the hot emitter flow across the inter-\nelectrode gap to the cooler collector. There they condense and return to the emitter \nthrough the electrical load connected externally between the collector and the emitter. \nWe choose the collector and emitter temperatures for best overaII system performance. \nIn choosing the collector temperature, we try to decrease the weight and size of \nthermal radiators, and we choose materials based on mission life requirements. Ther-\nmionic power sources usually rely on a reactor heat source because of the high \ntemperature required for efficient thennionic conversion. Power efficiencies for a \nthermionic power conversion are typically 10--20%. \n\nIn contrast to static sources, dynamic power sources use a heat source and a heat \nexchanger to drive an engine in a thermodynamic power cycle. The heat source can be \nconcentrated solar energy, radioisotopes, or a controlled nuclear-fission reaction. Heat \nfrom the source transfers to a working fluid, which drives an energy-conversion heat \nengine. For a dynamic solar-power source, the balance of energy remains as latent and \nsensible heat in a heat exchanger (molten eutectic salt), which provides continuous \nenergy to the thermodynamic cycle during eclipse periods. A dynamic power source \nusing a nuclear reactor or plutonium-238 decay does not require thermal-energy stor-\nage because the source provides continuous heat. \n\nDynamic power sources use one of three methods to generate electrical power. \nStirling cycle, Rankine cycle, or Brayton cycle. Stirling-cycle engines use a single-\nphase working fluid as the working medium. The thermodynamic cycle consists of \ntwo isothermal procesSes (compression and expansion) and two constant-volume pr0-\ncesses (heating and cooling). Power-conversion efficiencies for Stirling engines are \n25-30%. Rankine-cycle engines are dynamic devices that use a two-phase fluid system \n\n\n\ni /.: \n\n, i \n\n410 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.4 \n\nTABLE 11-33.

This power-conversion \ncycle IS essentlal1y the same as that used to generate electricity from fossil and nuclear \nenergy on Earth. Power-conversion efficiencies for Rankine-cycle engines are \n15-20%. Brayton-cycle engines are dynamic devices that use a single, compressible \nworking fluid as the working medium. The thermodynamic cycle consists of adiabatic \ncompression and expansion stages separated and coupled by stages that add or reject \n~ at constant pressure. Placed after the turbine, a recuperator-heat exchanger \nImproves the c:ycle's efficiency. Power conversion efficiencies for the Brayton cycle \nare 2.0-35%. \n\n11.4 Power 411 \n\nFuel cells convert the chemical energy of an oxidation reaction to electricity. They \nare self-contained generators that operate continuously without sunlight, but must \ncarry their own reactant supply, usually. The longer the mission, the larger the reactant \ntanks. The most popular version for space applications is the hydrogen-oxygen \n(referred to as \"alkaline\" because of the KOH electrolyte) ~el cell because of its \nrelatively high specific power (275 W/kg on the Space Shuttle), low reactant mass \n(hydrogen and oxygen); and useful by-product (water). . \n\nA typical single cell produces a voltage of 0.8 Vdc. In combination, a fuel cell unit \ncan create many kilowatts of power (each Shuttle fuel cell produces 16 kW peak or \n12 kW continuous). The energy conversion efficiency can run as high as 80% for low \ncurrent draws, but as current increases, the efficiency drops to 50-60%, due to activa-\ntion overpotential and electrical resistance in the electrolyte solution between elec-\ntrodes. However, compared with other power sources, fuel cell efficiencies are bigh. \n\nThe three Space Shuttle fuel cells are state-of-the-art power generators that produce \nall of the Shuttle electricity for the 28 Vdc bus. Their high efficiency (70%), low \nweight (118 kg), and excellent reliability (> 99% available) attest to their quality. \nOther important factors are their IS-min start-up time, instantaneous shutdown, and \nlong lifetime (2,400 hours before refurbishment). Besides electricity, these fuel cells \nproduce crew drinking water, at a rate of 0.36 kg/kWh, or about 104 kg a day.\u00b7 \n\nResearch is underway to solve the short-mission limit with fuel cells, caused by \ncarrying large reactant masses. Because the fuel-cell reaction is reversible, we can use \nelectrolysis to create more reactants from the water by-product To optimize each pr0-\ncess, however, we have to use separate units for generating electricity and separating \nthe water. Any long-duration mission could use this regenerative system if it had some \ninput electricity from solar cells, nuclear generators, or other power system during \nperiods of low electrical load. \n\nEarth-orbiting spacecraft at low-Earth to geosynchronous orbits have usually \nemployed photovoltaics as their power source. Often, photovoltaics were the only real \ncandidate for these low-power missions (less than 15 kW) because solar cells were \nwell-known and reliable. Photovoltaic sources are not attractive for interplanetary \nmissions to the outer planets because solar radiation decreases, thus reducing the avail-\nable energy from a solar array. To configure and size a solar array, we must understand \ncell types and characteristics; solar-array design issues, types, sizing calculations, con-\nfigurations, regulation; and radiation and thermal environments. Key design issues for \nsolar arrays include spacecraft configuration, required power level (peak and average), \noperating temperatures, shadowing, radiation environment, illumination or orienta-\ntion, mission life, mass aDd area, cost, and risk. Table 11-34 shows the solar array \ndesign process. \n\nStep 1. Mission life and the average power requirement are the two key design \nconsiderations in sizing the solar array for most spacecraft. We size a photovoltaic \nsystem to meet power requirements at EOL, with the resulting solar array often over-\nsized for power requirements at BOL. This excess power at BOL requires coordinated \nsystems engineering to avoid thermal problems. The longer the mission life, the larger \nthe difference between power requirements at EOL and BOL. We usually consider \nphotovoltaics a poor power source for missions lasting more than 10 years because of \nnatural degradation in the solar array.

Silicon presently \ncosts the least for most photovoltaic power applications, but it often requires larger \narea arrays and more mass than the more costly gallium-arsenide cells. Programs for \nwhich mass and volume (solar array area) are critical issues may allow higher costs or \ntechnical risks. They could select a system based on gallium arsenide or some other \nadvanced type of solar cell. Risk develops from the unproven reliability and fabrica-\ntion of the photovoltaic source. \n\nA solar array's illumination intensity depends on orbital parameters such as the Sun \nincidence angles, eclipse periods, solar distance, and concentration of solar energy. \nTracking and pointing mechanisms on the solar array often adjust for these influences. \nIf we mount the cells on the body of the spacecraft, we must orient them so they will \ngenerate adequate power throughout the mission. \n\nStep 2. To estimate the solar-array area required for a spacecraft, we first determine \nhow much power, Psa ' the solar array must provide during daylight to power the \nspacecraft for the entire orbit \n\n( PeTe + I:J7d) Xe Xd Psa = -\"--=----=~ \n7d \n\n(11-5) \n\nwhere Pe and Pd are the spacecraft's power requirements (excluding regulation and \nbattery charging losses) during eclipse and daylight, respectively, and Te and Td are \nthe lengths of these periods per orbit. The terms Xe and Xd represent the efficiency of \nthe paths from the solar arrays through the batteries to the individual loads and the path \ndirectly from the arrays to the loads, respectively. The efficiency values for eclipse and \ndaylight depend on the type of power regulation: direct energy transfer or peak-power \ntracking. (A description of these methods follows in Sec. 11.4.4.) For direct energy \ntransfer, the efficiencies are about Xe = 0.65 and Xd = 0.85; for peak-power tracking \nthey are Xe = 0.60 and Xd = 0.80. The efficiencies of the former are about 5% to 7% \ngreater than the latter because peak-power tracking requires a power converter \nbetween the arrays and the loads. \n\nStep 3. Table 11-35 shows the efficiencies and radiation-degradation sensitivities \nof three main types of cells. Gallium arsenide has the advantage of higher efficiencies, \nwhereas indium phosphide reduces the degrading effects of radiation. Silicon solar cell \ntechnology is mature and has the advantage of lower cost per watt for most applica-\ntions. Gallium arsenide and indium phosphide cost about 3 times more than silicon. \n\nThe energy-conversion efficiency of a solar cell is defined as the power output \ndivided by the power input. The power input value for a planar solar array is the solar-\nillumination intensity (1,367 W/m2). Thus, a solar panel with a BOL efficiency of 18% \nwill provide 246 W/m2\u2022 We must be aware that reported efficiency values for solar \npanels often apply only to single cells. We need to identify losses inherent to panel \nassembly (diodes, interconnect cabling, transmission losses) to size the array ade-\nquately. We also need to note that these efficiency values often refer to laboratory \ncells and not production cells, which have lower average efficiencies. \n\nTo complete this step. we identify the type of solar cells and how their performance \nwill degrade during the mission. Ideally, silicon and gallium arsenide solar cells have \nefficiencies of about 14.8% and 18.5%. These solar cell efficiencies give us ideal solar \ncell output perforinance per unit area, Po, of 202 W/m2 and 253 W/m2, respectively, \nif the incident solar radiation (1,367 W 1m2) is normal to the surface. \n\n\n\n414 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.4 11.4 Power 415 \n\nTABLE 11-35.

Next, we must determine the reaUsti,:! power production capability of the \nmanufactured solar array. As shown in Table 11-36, an assembled solar array is less \nefficient than single cells due to design inefficiencies, shadowing and temperature \nvariations, collectively referred to as inherent degradation, ld. Solar cells are applied \nto a substrate, usually honeycomb aluminum, and interconnected, resulting in losses \nof 10% of the solar array's substrate area. This accounts for the design and assembly \nlosses. H we configure the spacecraft well, its appendages will shadow few cells and \nshadowing losses should be slight. The temperature of a typical flat solar panel ~iv\u00ad\ning normal incident radiation ranges from about 67\u00b0C in LEO to 53 \u00b0c in GEO. The \nreference temperature for silicon solar cells is 28\u00b0C, with perfomulnce faIling off \n0.5% per degree above 28\u00b0C. Body-mounted arrays on nonspinning spacecraft are \ntypically about 5 \u00b0c warmer than deployed solar arrays because they can't radiate heat \ninto deep space as efficiently. \n\nTABLE 11-36. Elements of Inherent Solar Array DegradaUon. Although indMduat solar cells \nmay have adequate efficiency, after we manufacture the solar array, these \nelements ceuse some degradation in the cumulative efficiency by the amounts \nindicated. \n\nElements of Inherent Degradation Nominal Range \nDesign and Assembly 0.85 0.77-0.90 \nTemperature of Array 0.85 0.80-0.98 \nShadowing of eeHs 1.00 0.80-1.00 \nInherent Degradation, Id 0.77 0.49-0.88 \n\nAs mentioned earlier, we commonly refer to the current-voltage characteristics of \na solar cell as the I-V curves. Figure 11-9 depicts a first-quadrant I-V rurve for a \nplanar array in LEO. This curve characterizes BOL and EOL performance. As the \nfigure illustrates, the three significant points for solar-array design are: \n\n\u2022 Short-circuit current, lSI:' where voltage = 0 \n\n\u2022 Peak-power point, where voltage times current is maximized \n\n\u2022 Open-circuit voltage, \\he, where current = 0 \n\n1.50 \n\n1.25 ~Isc \ni 1.00 t-\n! \n1: 0.75 -\n~ \n:I \n(,) 0.50 -\n\n0.25 r \n\n0 I \n0 25 \n\ni I I I \n50 75 100 125 \n\nVoltage (V) \n\nEOl \n\nPeak \nPower \nPoint \n\nBOl \n\n150 175 \nJ \n\n200 \n\nFIg. 11-9. I-V Plot for a Planar Array. The power available is simply the area under the curve. \n\nWe must also consider how temperature affects the I-V characteristics. While the \nspacecraft is in eclipse, the solar-array temperature can get as.low as\n\no\n-80 \u00b0C. T?e high-\n\nest operating temperature for an LEO spacecraft solar array IS 100 C, occmnng near \nthe end of a full Sun period during an orbit. \n\nThe operating temperature of the array is a key issue because the solar cell's per-\nformance depends on temperature. A current-voltage, or I-V plot, illustrates the \nperformance of a solar-array cell, or the array (see Fig. 11-9). A change in the operat-\ning temperature of the solar cell or array causes three changes in the I-V curve: \n\n\u2022 A scaling of the I-V curve along the current axis \n\n\u2022 A translation or shifting of the I-V curve along the voltage axis \n\n\u2022 A change in the I-V curve shape affecting the roundness of the knee region \n\nThe temperature coefficient, or percent degradation of performance with increasing \ntemperature, for any solar cell depends on factors such as the type of cell and its \noutput-power characteristics, actual operating temperature, and radiation en~\u00ad\nment. GaIlium arsenide and indium phosphide have lower temperature coeffiCIents, \nbut higher temperature stiII means reduced performance. Solar arrays using ga1Iium \narsenide and indium phosphide also resist radiation better than silicon and provide \ngreater EOL power for a given area. We must establish a profile for operating temper-\natures during a mission, so the photovoltaic system can generate adequate power \nthroughout. \n\nThe peak-power point depends on the array's operating temperature at BOL and \nEOL. Thus, an array often provides maximum power coming out of an eclipse period \nbecause it is at its coldest operating temperature. Transient voltage excursions often \noccur when leaving eclipse, so we may need to clamp voltages to protect spacecraft \nloads. By understanding how the array's performance relates to these variables, we can \nget the highest output power from the array. \n\nUsually, solar cells in series-parallel combinations make up a solar array. The \nnumber of series-connected solar cells in one string establishes the bus voltage \n\n\n\n416 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.4 \n\nrequired at EOL at the operating temperature; the number of parallel strings depends \non the required current output. Isolation diodes mounted within the solar array \ntypically minimize the effects of shadowing and reversed-biased solar cells. \n\nSolar-array configurations are either planar or concentrator,and either type can be \nbody- or panel-mounted. Most photovoltaic applications to date have employed a \nplanar array in which solar cells are mounted onto a surface (typically insulated alu-\nminum honeycomb) with an adhesive. A Kapton, Kevlar, or fiberglass sheet usually \ninsulates the solar cell from the aluminum honeycomb support structure. Concentrator \nsolar arrays increase the solar cell's output by using mirrors or lenses to focus more \nsolar radiation on the cells. \n\nPanel-mounted solar arrays usually apply only to 3-axis stabilized spacecraft. The \npanel-mounted approach tracks and points the solar array to get the best Sun incidence \nangle. The body-mou~te<;f approach ~uces the requirements ~or tracking and pointing \non ~y spacecraft (spmrung or stabilized). But the less effective Sun incidence angle \nand InCreased array temperature of body-mounted cells produce a lower efficiency in \norbit. Panel-mounted solar arrays are usually mounted on a boom. Deployable panel \narrays are either flexible or rigid, according to the type of substrate material employed \nfor mounting. For most spacecraft. we try to place the solar array away from the \npayload and other spacecraft subsystems because of the variable and often high \ntemperature of the solar cells. \n\nBody-mounted planar cells are typical on spinning spacecraft, which provide ther-\nmal control by radiating excess heat to space as the spacecraft spins. Body-mounted \nsolar arrays use cells inefficiently because of higher temperature and reduced voltage. \nThus, they generate lower power per unit area than a deployed, oriented panel. When \nsolar cells are body-mounted to a spinning spacecraft, the array's total output power \ndecreases because the cells are not alway.s oriented toward the Sun. This decrease \n~epends on the spacecraft's configuration and the drive mechanisms of the solar array \n(If any). For example, a stabilized array using Sun-tracking and pointing on two axes \nwould fully use the solar array's surface area. But the array's reduction in output \npower per total surface area would be approximately 1t for body-mounted cells on a \ncylindrical, spinning spacecraft and 4 for body-mounted cells on a cubic-shaped \nspacecraft that does not employ active tracking. The output power decreases because \nnot all cells are illuminated. We must trade the cost and design for the solar array's \nto~ surf~ce area against the cost and complexity of stabilizing the spacecraft and \nUSIng a drive system for the solar array. \n\nShadowing considerations are important because it solar cell will go into open \ncircuit (become high resistance) when not illuminated. In a series-connected string of \nsolar cells, the shadowing of one cell results in the loss of the entire string. Shadowing \nmay be caused by spacecraft components such as transmitting or receiving antennas, \ndeployment mechanisms, or structures such as the solar-array. We can reduce shadow-\ning effects by actively pointing and tracking solar arrays on 3-axis stabilized space-\ncraft, using diodes, or designing series-parallel arrays. On spinning spacecraft, we \nmust layout solar cells so all solar cells within a string are illuminated. Diodes, which \nbypass groups of solar cells in a string, help prevent damage to reduce the advance \neffects of shadowed solar cells. \n\nWe can improve solar cell performance with coverslides, coatings, and back-\nsurface reflectors. Coverslides provide a hermetic seal yet allow the cell to receive \nsunlight and reject heat. They are textured or smooth. A textured coverslide is used for \nbody-mounted solar cells that do not actively point toward the Sun. It reflects incident \n\n11.4 Power 417 \n\nsolar energy back onto the solar cell, improving the overall efficiency. Smooth cover-\nslides are used for spacecraft whose arrays actively track and point By decreasing \nreflective losses on solar cells, coatings allow cells to use more of the incident energy. \nBack-surface reflectors direct incident solar radiation that passes through the solar cell \nback through the cell again to improve overall efficiency. By reducing solar abs~ \ntance. they help the solar array manage thermal energy. Solar-cell vendors are \ncontinually improving the mechanical and thermal characteristics of coverslides, coat-\nings, and back-surface reflectors. Thus, we must coordinate mechanical and thermal \ncharacteristics of these cells with the vendors. \n\nAt beginning-of-life, the array's power per unit area is \n\n(11-6) \n\nwhere cos 6 is referred to as the cosine loss. We measure the Sun incidence angle. 6, \nbetween the vector normal to the surface of the array and the Sun line. So if the Sun's \nrays are perpendicular to the solar array's surface, we get maximum power. Obviously, \nthe geometry between the array and the Sun changes throughout the mission and \ndifferent solar array panels will have different geometry. We configure the solar array \nto minimize this cosine loss. For example, in OED with a flat, silicon solar array and \na worst-case Sun angle of 9 = 23.5 deg angle between equatorial and ecliptic planes \nand the nominal value of -'d, the power output at beginning-of-life is 143 W/m2. \n\nStep 5. Radiation damage severely reduces a solar array's output voltage and cur-\nrent At geosynchronous altitude, we must guard against solar-flare protons on-station, \ntrapped electrons on-station, and trapped electrons and protons during transfer orbits. \n(Chapter 8 explains these terms.) Electrons and protons trapped in the Earth's mag-\nnetic field cause most degradation of solar cells. Silicon solar cells protected by \ncoverslides lose 15% of their voltage and current (shielding assumed) when exposed \nto a total fluenee of 1015 MeV equivalent electrons (4 to 5 years for a LEO spacecraft). \nA.s mission planners, we should coordinate degradation characteristics with the solar-\ncell manufacturer, based on the radiation environment the spacecraft will encounter. \nDegradation of a solar cell also depends on its design. Advanced technologies, such as \nindium phosphide cells, are more radiation hardened. \n\nNext, we must consider the factors that degrade the solar array's performance \nduring the mi.ssion. Life degradation, Ld' occurs because of thermal cycling in and out \nof eclipses, micrometeoroid strikes, plume impingement from thrusters, and material \noutgassing for the dmation of the mi.ssion. In general, for a silicon solar array in LEO. \npower production can decrease by as much as 3.75% per year, of which up to 2.5% per \nyear is due to radiation. For gallium-arsenide cells in LEO, the degradation is about \n2.75% per year, of which radiation causes 1.5% per year. The actual lifetime degrada-\ntion can be estimated using \n\nLd= (1- degradationlyr)saleUite life (11-7) \n\nThe array's performance per unit area at end-of-life is \n\nPEOL = PBOL Ld (11-8) \nUsing the FueSat exanIple array in Table 11-34 for a 5-year mi.ssion, Ld is 82.6%, re-\nsulting in a PEOL of 118.1 WJm2. The solar-array area, Asa. required to support the \nspacecraft's power requirement, P sa' is \n\nAsa = Psa IPEOL (11-9) \n\n\n\n'I' I,' \ni 418 Spacecraft Subsystems 1L4 11.4 Power 419 \n\nThe resulting solar-array area for the example spacecraft is about 2.0 m2\u2022 If we had \nused a perfectly pointed array, the BOL power would have been 155 W/m2, resulting \nin an EOL power of 128 W/m2 and an array area of 1.9 m2\u2022 So, having to account for \nthe cosine loss costs us 0.1 m2 in array size and the equivalent mass. \n\nSolar-array sizing is more difficult than it appears from the above discussion. \nTypically, we must consider several arrays with varying geometry. Also, the angle of \nincidence on the array surface is constantly changing. We must predict that angle COD-\ntinuously or at least determine the worst-case angle to develop an estimate of PEOL ' \n\n11.4.2 Energy Storage \n\nEnergy storage is an integral part of the spacecraft's electrical-power subsystem \nproviding all the power for short missions \u00ab 1 week) or back-up power for longer \nmissions (> 1 week). Any spacecraft that uses photovoltaics or solar thermal dynamics \nas a power source requires a system to store energy for peak-power demands and \neclipse periods. Energy storage typically occms in a battery, although systems such as \nflywheels and fuel cells have been considered 'for various spacecraft. \n\nA battery consists of individual cells connected in series. The number of cells \nrequired is determined by the bus-voltage. The amount of energy stored within the bat-\ntery is the ampere-hour capacity or watt-hour (ampere-hour times operating Voltage) \ncapacity. The design or nameplate ~pacity of the battery derives from the energy-\nstorage requirements. Batteries can be connected in series to increase the voltage or in \nparallel to increase this current output-tbe net result being an increase in watt-hour \ncapacity. \n\nTable 11-37 lists issues to consider early in the conceptual phase of any program. \nMost of all, we try to provide a stable voltage for all operating conditions during the \nmission life because load users prefer a semi-regulated bus voltage. The difference in \nenergy-storage voltage between end of charge and end of discharge often determines \nthe range of this bus voltage. \n\nTABLE 11-37. Issues In Designing the Energy Storage Capability. Energy storage usually \nmeans large batteries and we must consider all their characteristics when \ndesigning this subsystem. \n\nPhysical Size, weight, configuration, operating position, static and dynamic environments \n\nElectrical Voltage, current loading, duty cycles, number of duty cycles, activation time and \nstorage time, and Omits on depth-of-dlscharge \n\nProgrammatic Cost, shelf and cycle ute, mission, reUablDty, malntalnablDty, and produceabDity \n\nFigure 11-10 highlights the charge-discbarge characteristics of a spacecraft's \nenergy-storage system. We want a flat discharge curve that extends through most of \nthe capacity and little overcharge. Overcharging quickly degrades most batteries. We \nalso need to match the electrical characteristics of the battery cells. Otherwise, charge \nimbalances may stress and degrade the batteries, resulting in a shorter life for the \nelectrical-power subsystem. \n\nAll battery cells are either primary or secondary. Primary battery cells convert \nchemical energy into electrical energy but cannot reverse this conversion, so they can-\nnot be recharged. Primary batteries typically apply to short missions (less than one \nday) or to long-term tasks such as memory backup, which use very little power.

Secondary batteries may cycle \nthrough this type of profile hundreds or thOusands of times during their mission DIe. At \nthe left edge, the voltage Is low because the spacecraft just ceme out of eclipse where \nIt used battery power. During the charge phase, there Is positive current from the \npower regulator, so the battery voltage rises. In the discharge phase (In eclipse again), \nthere Is a negative current, so the battery voltage decreases. \n\nmost common batteries use silver zinc, lithium thionyl chloride, lithium sulfur dioxide, \nlithium monoflouride, and thermal cells. Table 11-38 highlights the applications and \nrelative merits. It also depicts the wide ranges in each couple's specific-energy \ndensity. We cannot specify a value for specific-energy density because cells vary in \ndesign and depend on mission requirements. We must coordinate mission require-\nments with the battery manufacturer to specify battery performance. \n\nTABLE 11-38. Characteristics of Selected Primary Batteries.

Secondary batteries recharge in sunlight and discharge during eclipse. The \nspacecraft's orbital parameters, especially altitude, determine the number of \ncharge/discharge cycles the batteries has to support during the mission life. A geosyn-\nchronous satellite needs to store energy for two 45-day eclipse periods per year with \neclipses lasting no more than 72 min each day. The geosynchronous orbit demands \nfew charge/discharge cycles during eclipse periods, thus allowing a fairly high (50%) \ndepth-of -discharge. On the other hand, LEO spacecraft encounter at most one eclipse \nperiod each orbit or about 15 eclipse periods per day, with maximum shadowing of ap-\nproximately 36 min. Therefore, the batteries must charge and discharge about 5,000 \ntimes each year, and the average depth-of-discharge is only 15-25%-much lower \nthan for geosynchronous spacecraft. \n\nTABLE 11-39.

The typical \nindividual pressure vessel battery design consists of multiple cells connected in series \nto obtain the desired battery voltage. Cell diameters are typically 9 to 12 em, with ca-\npacity ranges from 20 to over 300 Amp-hr. The common pressure vessel NiH2 tech-\nnology is very similar to individual pressme vessel, with the primary difference in the \nwiring connection of the internal electrode stacks. In the individual pressure vessel, the \nelectrode stacks are all connected in parallel. In a common pressure vessel, there are \ntwo sets of electrode stacks within the pressure vessel that are series connected, yield-\ning a working terminal voltage of 2.44 to 2.50 Vdc. This design has a higher specific-\nenergy at the battery level since there are half as many pressure vessels and a signifi-\ncant reduction in cell piece-parts. Common pressure vessel NiH2 technology has been \nspace qualified in the 6 cm and 9 cm cell diameter configuration for capacities in the \n12 to 20 Amp-hr range. Batteries with larger Amp-hr capacities should be qualified for \naerospace application in the near future. The single pressure vessel NiH2 battery is de-\nsigned such that a common hydrogen supply is used by three or more series connected \ncells with a single pressure vessel. Each cell stack contains its own electrolyte supply \nwhich is isolated within individual cell stack containers. The key operating character-\nistic of this design is to allow the free movement of hydrogen within the cell stacks \nwhile maintaining cell stack electrolyte isolation. These batteries are presently avail-\nable in a 125 em or 25 cm diameter design. \n\nLithium Ion battery technology offers a significant energy density advantage and a \nmuch wider operating temperature range over NiCd and NiH2 battery types. Typical \ncell constituents are lithium thionyl chloride, lithium sulfur dioxide, and lithium \ncarbon monofluoride. The nominal operating voltage for a lithium ion cell is 3.6 to \n3.9 Vdc, which allows us to reduce the number of cells by approximately one-third \nWhen compared to NiCd or NiH2 cells. The lithium ion secondary battery system \noffers a 65% volume advantage and a 50% mass advantage for most present day \naerospace battery applications. Lithium ion battery technology should be qualified for \n\n\n\n422 Spaceciaft Subsystems 11.4 \n\na planetary mission by the year 2000, with space qualification for GEO and LEO \napplications by the years 2005-2010. \n\nTo size a secondary battery, we must identify the parameters and apply the equation \nin Table 11-40. The parameter values used in the equation can vary significantly with \nbattery type. The ideal battery capacity is the average eclipse load, Pe, times the \neclipse duration, Te. This ideal capacity must be increased to include the battery-to-\nload transmission efficiency, n, and the depth-of-discharge constraints. For LEO, we \nexpect the battery's DOD to be 40--60% for NiH2 technology, compared to 1{}:-20% \nfor NiCd technology. We base these expectations on the average DOD over 24 hours \nand assume the batteries are fully recharged at least once during this period. The \nnumber of batteries, N, may be equal to one for this calculation if you simply require \na battery capacity. Two to five batteries are typical. We must have at least two (unless \nthe battery uses redundant cells) because the spacecraft needs redundant operation \nwith one unit failed. But more than five batteries require complex components for \nrecharging. The secondary batteries may be required to help meet peak power loads \nduring full Sun conditions. For some missions, the peak power loads may drive the \nrequired battery capacity rather than the eclipse load. To design the Energy-Storage \nsubsystem, follow the steps in Table 11-40 \n\nTABLE 11-40. Steps In the Energy Storage Subsystem Design.

It also includes \ncommand decoders to command specifi~ load relays on or off. The power distrib~ti\"!l \nsystem is a unique feature of the electrIcal-power subsystem and often reflects indi-\nvidual spacecraft loads and power-switching requireme~ts: Power distri~ution designs \nfor various power systems depend on source characteristics, load reqwrements, and \nsubsystem functions. In selecting a type of power distribution. we focus on keeping \npower losses and mass at a minimum while attending to survivability, cost, reliability, \nand power quality. . .. \n\nPower switches are usually mechamcal relays because of then proven flight \nhistory. reliability. and low power dissipation. Solid-state relays, based on power tech-\nnology, which uses metaI-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors are available. \n\nThe load profile of a spacecraft is a key determining factor in the design specifica-\ntions of a power distribution subsystem. Predominant spacecraft loads (radar, com-\nmunications, motors. computers) may require low- to high-voltage dc (5-270 Vdc), \nhigh-voltage single-phase ac (115 Vrms, 60 Hz), or high-voltage three-phase ac \n(120/440 Vrms, 400 Hz)-all converted from the 28-Vdc power bus. Because the ~g\u00ad\nulation requirements for these loads vary, the bus voltage may need further regulating, \nleveling up or down, and, possibly. inverting through dc-dc converters. Spacecraft \npower loads often tum on or off or otherwise vary their power consumption. Transient \nbehavior within a load may produce noise that the distribution system translates to \nother loads. potentially harming working components. In addition, certain spacecraft \nloads require a voltage different from the bus voltage. Power converters often connect \nloads susceptJ'ble to noise or requiring voltage conversion to the distn'bution system. \nThese converters typically isolate the load from the noise on the bus and regulate the \npower provided to the load against disturbances from the load and the bus. They also \nkeep load failures from damaging the power-distribution system and provide on~ff \ncontrol to desired loads. Any dc-dc converter connected to the bus must dampen Its \nelectromagnetic-interference filter to keep step loads from causing excessive ringing. \n\nWe need to know the boundaries of the load profile to evaluate its effects on \nrequired bus voltage and frequency. Most spacecraft have demanded ~ow power \n\u00ab 2,000 W), so power distribution has relied on a standard, 28 V bus. This standard, \nwith electronic parts built to match, has limited study of the best bus voltage. As power \nsystems expand to many kilowatts, the 28 V bus may not work for power distribution \nbecause of losses in cabling and limits on mass. The harness or cabling that intercOD-\nnects the spacecraft's subsystems is a large part (10-25%) of the electrical-power \nsystem's mass. We must keep harnesses as short as possible to reduce voltage drops \nand to regulate the bus voltage. Figure 11-12 depicts the relationship between current \nand cable mass. \n\nSystems for distributing power on spacecraft have been predominantly dc because \nspacecraft generate direct current power. Direct-current systems will dominated \nthroughout the 199Os. Conversion to ac would require more electronics, which would \nadd mass to. the BPS. Altemating-current power distribution applies only for high-\npower spacecraft, such as the International Space Station, which have many electrical \nloads with varying duty cycles. Even on the space station, however. recent decisions \nhave taken planners back to de for the entire distribution system. \n\nPower distn'bution systems are either centralized or decentralized, depending on the \nlocation of the converters.

Operating low current (less than 30 amps) devices \nhelps keep this mass low. \n\nload separately, whereas the centralized approach regulates power to all spacecraft \nloads within the main bus. The decentralized approach implies an unregulated bus \nbecause distributed converters regulate power. A regulated power bus typically has \nsome power converters at the load interface because electronics may require different \nvoltages (+5, \u00b112 V dc). An advantage of the centraIized system is that we do not have \nto taiIor-design the EPS for different applications. Larger spacecraft with high power \nlevels use the decentralized distribution systems, with an unregulated bus, usually. \n\nFault protection within the BPS focuses on detection, isolation, and correction of \nfaults. Its main purpose is to isolate a failed load that could eventually cause loss of \nthe mission or the spacecraft. A failed load typically implies a short circuit, which will \ndraw excessive power. If this condition continues, the failed load may stress cables and \ndrain the energy-storage reserve. Typically, we would isolate these faults from the \nBPS bus with fuses (sometimes resettable). Most spacecraft power loads have some \nsort of fuse in series with the power bus to isolate faults. Of course, if the mission \nrequires us to know where load faults occur, we can add fault-detection circuits. To \ndesign the Power Distribution subsystem, follow the steps in Table 11-41. \n\n11.4.4 Power Regulation and Control \n\nThe energy source determines how we regulate a spacecraft's power. For example, \nwe regulate a static or dynamic power source through the direct energy transfer \nmethod discussed below.

P.ower regulation \ndivides into three main categories: controlling the solar array, regulating bus voltage, \nand charging the battery. \n\nWe must control electrical power generated at the array to prevent battery over-\ncharging and undesired spacecraft heating. The two main power control techniques, \nillustrated in Fig. 11-13, are a peak-power tracker (PPT) and a direct-energy-transfer \n(DEl) subsystem. A PPT is a nondissipative subsystem because it extracts ~e ex~ct \npower a spacecraft requires up to the array's peak power. The DET subsystem IS a ~s\u00ad\nsipative subsystem because it dissipates power not used by the loads. However; a DET \nsubsystem can dissipate this power at the array or through external banks of shunt \nresistors to avoid internal power dissipation. DET s~bsystems commonly use sh.unt \nregulation to maintain the bus voltage at a predetemuned level. Figure 11-13 depIcts \nthe main functional differences between varying PPT and shunt-regulated DET sub-\n~~ . \n\nA PPT is a dc-dc converter operating in series with the solar array. Thus, It \ndynamically changes the operating point of the solar-array source to the voltage side \nof the array (Fig. 11-13) and tracks the peak-power point w~en en~ demand \nexceeds the peak power.

Because the \nPPf is in series with the array, it uses 4-7% of the total power. A PPT has advantages \nfor missions under 5 years that require more power at BOL than at EOL. \n\nFor direct energy transfer systems a shunt regulator operates in para11el to the array \nand shunts the array current (typically at the array) away from the subsystem when the \n\n\n\nr , \n426 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.4 \n\nPeak PowerTracklng (PPT) Systems Direct Energy Transfer (DEl) Systems \n\nUnregulated \nBusUsJng \nPaJaOel Batteries \n\nUnregulated \nBus Using \nlinear Charge \nCurrent Control \nRecharge Control \n\nQuasi-Regulated \nBus with Constant \nCurrent Chargers \n\nSystems \nUsing a Fully \nRegulated Bus \n\nFIg. 11-13. Techniques for Power Regulation. The basic approaches are Peak Power Track. \nIng (PP7), which places a regulator In series with the solar arrays and the load, and \nDirect Energy Transfer(DE1), which uses a regulator In parallal with the solar arrays \nand load. \n\nloads or battery ch~g do no! n~ po:-ver. Power subsystems with shunt regulation \nare extremely effiCIent. They dissIpate little energy by simply shunting excess power \nat the array or. through shunt resistor banks. A shunt-regulated subsystem has \nadvantag~: fewer parts, Jo~er mass, and higher total efficiency at EOL. \n\nTechniqu~ for controlling bus voltage on electrical-power subsystems fall into \n~ categones:. ~gulated, quasi-regulated, or fully regulated. Figure 11-13 \nillustrates the mam differences between these techniques. An unregulated subsystem \nhas a load bus voltage that varies significantly. The bus-voltage regulation derives \nfrom battery regulation, which varies about 20% from charge to discharge. In an \nunregulafed subsystem, the load bus voltage is the voltage of the batteries. \n\n9uasl-regul~ed subsystems regulate the bus voltage during battery charge but not \ndunng ba~ disc~ge. A battery charger is in series with each battery or group of \nparallel batteries. During charge the bus voltage fixes at a potential several volts above \nthe batteries. As the batteries reach full charge, the drop across the chargers decreases, \n\nUA Power 427 \n\nbut the bus voltage is still constantly regulated. The bus becomes unregulated during \ndischarge when the voltage is about a diode drop lower than the batteries and decreases \nas the batteries further discharge. A quasi-regulated power subsystem has low effi-\nciency and high electromagnetic interference if used with a peak-power tracker. \n\nThe fully regulated power subsystem is inefficient, but it will work on a spacecraft \nthat requires low power and a highly regulated bus. This subsystem employs charge \nand discharge regulators. We can design the regulators so the charge regulator uses lin-\near technology and the discharge regulator is a switching converter, but for best effi-\nciency both should be converters. The advantage of this type of power subsystem is \nthat, when we connect it to the loads, the system behaves like a low-impedance power \nsupply, making design integration a simple task. But it is the most complex type of \npower subsystem, with an inherent low efficiency and high electromagnetic \ninterference when used with a PPT or boost converter. \n\nWe can charge batteries individually or in parallel. A parallel charging system is \nsimpler and has the lower cost, but does not allow flexibility in vehicle integration. It \ncan also stress batteries so they degrade faster. When batteries are charged in parallel, \nthe voltage is the same but the current and temperature are not Because cUrrent is not \nrigidly controlled, one battery could receive all the available charge current, and a \nthermal runaway condition could result if we do not control the bus voltage from the \nhottest battery. Parallel batteries eventually end up balancing out, so we could use \nthem for missions under five years. To ensure a battery life greater than five years, we \nshould seriously consider independent chargers, such as the linear, charge-current-\ncontrol (LC3 ) design in Fig. 11-13. \n\nBatteries usually limit the life of a spacecraft. To support a seven-year life, we must \ncharge the batteries independently to degrade the battery as little as possible. Individ-\nual charging optimizes the battery use by charging all the batteries to their own unique \nlimits. It also forgives battery deviations in systems with several batteries. Unfor-\ntunately, individual chargers add impedance, electronic piece parts, and thermal \ndissipation not present in a parallel system.

Grob, Wes Ousley, Goddard Space Flight Center \n\nThe role of the thermal control subsystem (TCS) is to maintain all spacecraft and \np~yload components and subsystems within their required temperature limits for each \nmission phase. Temperature limits include a cold temperature which the component \nmust not go below and a hot temperature that it must not exceed. Two limits are \nfrequently defined: operational limits that the component must remain within while \noperating and survival limits that the component must remain within at all times, even \nwh~n not powered. Exceeding survival temperature limits can result in permanent \n~.Ipment damage as opposed to out-of-tolerance performance when operational \nhmlts are ~xceeded. Table 11-43 gives typical component temperature ranges for \nrepresentative spacecraft components. Thermal control is also used to ensure that \ntemperature gradient requirements are met. An example of a gradient requirement is \nto ensure that one side of a structure does not get hotter or colder than the opposite side \nby more than, say, 30 dC. A larger gradient could cause structural deformation such \nthat pointing is adversely impacted. possibly permanently. \n\nTABLE 11-43.

Cooler components generally last longer, and this allows for system power \ngrowth. Thoug~ this can require ad~tional power,. it d~eases the number of \nexpensive iteratiOns on the thermal design and analysIs (which happens anyway, of \ncourse). \n\nThermal control is critical to ensuring the performance and survival of spacecraft \nand payioad equipment. Consider your personal computer, for example. It typically \noperates at room temperature plus or minus a few\n\no \n10' s of degrees. The sp~ce en.viron-\n\nment can cause equipment to get as hot as 100 C and as cold as -130 C With the \nchanges occurring in lO's of seconds or minutes. Your cenpho~e works poorly, if ~t \nworks at all, after being kept in your black car during a hot summer afternoon. In thiS \nexample, the environment reaches approximately 600 to 65 DC. \n\nTable 11-44 summarizes the design process for the thermal control system. As \nalways, we begin with the development of requirements and constraints, paying \nparticular attention to specific equipment or events likely to cause problems, such as \nthe need for maintaining cryogenic temperatures for a payload instrument or a long \nthruster firing that may cause significant radiant heating on nearby surfaces. Step 2 is \nto determine the overall thermal environment of the spacecraft, i.e., characterize the \nheat inputs throughout the entire life of the mission. The most important external heat \nsource will nearly always be the Sun, which continuously provides 1367 W/m2 (called \nthe solar constant) at the mean distance of the Earth from the Sun and which varies as \nl/r2 with distance from the Sun. (See Fig. 11-14.) This input goes away whenever the \nspacecraft enters a period of eclipse as discussed in Sec. 5.1. However, the Earth or \nother nearby central body serves as a moderating thermal influence by radiating heat \nin the infrared, corresponding to the blackbody temperature of the central body. (See \nSec. 9.3.1.) \n\nRg.11-14. Satellite Thermal Environment The most significant external heat source is the \nSun but we must also include reflected solar energy (albedo) and Earth Infrared In \nour ~culations. The only way a spacecraft can get rid of heat Is by radiating It to \nspace. \n\nIn Step 3, we review thermal requirements and constraints, compare them with \nactual heat sources and equipment placement. and identify situations where the \nmaximum and minimum equilibrium temperatures of the equipment are outside the \nrequired limits. For example, challenges arise when we must deal with cryogenic \n\n\n\n~ I: \nI I ' . \nI \n\n430 \n\n; ... ... \n\n,.... \n\ni ~ ,.... \n\nSpacecraft Subsystems \n\n~~ \nIll\u00b7 ,....,.... ,....,.... \n\n\"i~ Ill. ,....,.... ,....,.... \n\nIt) \n\n.q ,.... ,.... \n\nco \n.q ,.... ,.... \n\n11.s 11.5 Thermal 431 \n\ndevices or when required temperature tolerances are very tight. Once we thoroughly \nunderstand the thermal control challenges, we enter Step 4 of the process to develop \nthermal designs that can be used to satisfy our requirements. These may range from \napplying different paillts, multi-layer insulation blankets, and component placement. \nto the use of more sophisticated devices like cryogenic cooling systems, heat pipes, \nand thermostatically-controlled heaters. \n\nOnce we have identified a potential thermal control approach and configuration, we \nproceed to Step 5 where we determine the radiator and heater requirements for the \nspacecraft and its components. We consider two worst-case conditions: worst-case \nhot, where the spacecraft is in the Sun and maximum power is being dissipated, and \nworst-case cold, where the spacecraft is in eclipse and dissipating minimum power. \nDuring this step we also try to understand the performance of the thermal control \nsystem over time taking into account degradation of thermal control surfaces and \nextraordinary thermal events or circumstances. \n\nIn Step 6 we use the information generated previously to estimate the mass and \npower of the thermal control system. As usual we document the results (in Step 7) and \nrepeat the entire process until we create a thermal control system that meets the re-\nquirements and constraints at an acceptable mass, cost. and risk. \n\nEach of the steps in this process is discussed in more detail below. For a much more \nextensive discussion of the thermal control process for space systems see Gilmore \n[2002] or Karam [1998]. \n\n11.5.1 Spacecraft Thermal Environment \nSpacecraft thermal control is a process of energy management in which the thermal \n\nenvironment plays a major role. Over the course of the development and operational \nlife cycle, a spacecraft will be exposed to environments encountered during ground \ntesting, transportation, launch, orbit transfer, and operational orbits with nominal and \nsafehold attitudes. During ground operations, convection with ambient air and radiant \nheat exchange with surrounding objects are the principal environmental influences. \nDuring launch ascent, radiant heating from the inside surfaces of the booster fairing \nand, after the fairing is jettisoned, free-molecular heating due to friction with the \natmosphere are the dominant environmental drivers. Once above the upper reaches of \nthe atmosphere, direct sunlight. sunlight reflected off of Earth or other planets \n(albedo), and infrared (IR) energy emitted from a planet's atmosphere or surface are \nthe only significant sources of environmental heat. In most cases, the thermal control \nsystem is designed to maintain all spacecraft components within allowable tempera-\nture limits in the environments encountered on-orbit. while compatibility with ground \noperations and launch ascent conditions is assured by controlling the environment or \nlimiting the spacecraft's exposure to it. \n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 11-15, the overall thermal control of a spacecraft on orbit is \nusually achieved by balancing the heat emitted by the spacecraft as IR radiation \nagainst the heat dissipated by its internal components plus the heat absorbed from the \nenvironment; atmospheric convection is absent in space. Because a generic thermal \ncontrol system capable of maintaining spacecraft temperatures in all environments \nwould be prohibitively heavy and expensive, it is generally more cost effective and \npractical to custom-tailor a thermal design to each spacecraft and its mission environ-\nment. This means that the thermal design analysis must consider the worst case hot and \ncold combinations of waste heat generated by spacecraft components in their various \noperating modes and the variable environmental heat loads on the spacecraft. \n\n\n\ni j \n\n,I \n\ni \n\n432 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.s \n\nDirect Solar \n\nSunlight is the major source of environmental heating on most spacecraft. Fortu-\nnately, the Sun is a very stable energy source which is constant to within a fraction of \na percent. However, because the Earth's orbit is elliptical, the intensity of sunlight \nreaching Earth varies approximately \u00b1 3.5%, depending on Earth's distance from the \nSun. At summer solstice, Earth is farthest from the Sun, and the intensity is at a mini-\nmum value of 1322 W/m2; at winter solstice, the intensity is at its maximum value of \n1414 W/m2\u2022 The intensity of sunlight at Earth's mean distance from the Sun (1 AU) is \nknown as the solar constant and is equal to 1367 W/m2\u2022 \n\nSolar intensity also varies as a function of wavelength, as shown in Fig. 11-15. The \nenergy distribution is approximately 7% ultraviolet, 46% visible, .and 47% near \n(short-wavelength) IR. However, the IR energy emitted by the Sun is of a much shorter \nwavelength than that emitted by a body near room temperature. This distinction allows \nfor the selection of thennal-control finishes that are very reflective in the solar spec-\ntrum but highly emissive to room temperature (long-wavelength) IR, as shown in \nFig. 11-15. These finishes, which will be discussed in more detail later, minimize solar \nheat loads while maximizing a spacecraft's ability to reject waste heat. \n\nQuartz mirror radiator \nabsorptance or \"\"-, \nemittance ~ , \n\nSolar spectrum I \\ \n(no vertical scale): , \n\nI \nI \n\nI~ I \nII} \n\n10 \nWavelength (jun) \n\nRoom temperature \nI body spectrum \n, ~ vertical scale) \n\n1/ \nI \n\n20 \n\nRg. 11-15.

Note that solar energy \nwavelength Is much shorter than that of a body at .room temperature. The dashed \nline represents the absorptance or emittance of a quartz mirror radiator. The point Is \nthat we can select thermal control coatings that are highly reflective to high energy \nInputs like solar energy and highly emissive at room temperatures. \n\nAlbedo \n\nSunlight reflected off a planet or moon is known as albedo. A planet's albedo is \nusually expressed as the fraction of incident sunlight that is reflected back to space and \nis highly variable. Usually, reflectivity is greater over land as compared with oceans \nand generally increases with decreasing local solar-elevation angles and increasing \ncloud coverage. Because of greater snow and' ice coverage, decreasing solar elevation \nangle, and increasing cloud coverage, albedo also tends to increase with latitude. \nThese variations make selection of the best albedo value for a particular thermal \nanalysis rather uncertain, and it is not unusual to find variations throughout the \nindustry. Representative values for orbits of different inclinations are shown in \nTable 11-45A. \n\n11.5 \n\nTABLE 11-45A. \n\nOrbft \n\nThermal 433 \n\nTypical Orbit-Average Earth IR and Albedo Values for Varfous Orbits \n(Data Courtesy NASA). This table shows the relative nature of Earth-emitted \nIR and percent Albedo as a function of orbit Inclination. Note that the highest \nvalues of Earth-emitted IR occur at lower inclinations associated with tropical \nand desert regions. The value of Earth-emltted IR decreases with increasing \nlatitude. In general, albedo Increases with increasing latitude. \n\nAngle of Emitted Radiation Albedo \nSun Out of (W/m2) (percent) \n\nInclination Orbit Plane \n(deg) .

While this balance is \nmaintained fairly well on a global annual average basis, the intensity of IR energy \nemitted at any given time from a particular point on Earth can vary considerably de-\npending on factors such as the local temperature of Earth's surface and the amount of \ncloud cover. A warmer surface region will emit more radiation than a colder one. \nGenerally, highest values of Earth emitted IR will occur in tropical and desert regions \n(as these are the regions of the globe receiving the maximum solar heating) and will \ndecrease with increasing latitude. Cloud cov.er tends to lower Earth emitted m because \ncloud tops are cold and clouds effectively block up-welling radiation from the Earth's \nwanner surface below. These localized variations in Earth emitted m, while signifi-\ncant, are much less severe than the variations in albedo. Representative orbit-average \nvalues for Earth IR are shown in Table 11-45A. \n\nThe m energy emitted by the Earth, which has an effective average temperature \naround -18\u00b0C, is of approximately the same wavelength as that emitted by spacecraft; \nthat is, it is of much longer wavelength than the energy emitted by the Sun at 5500 DC. \nUnlike short-wavelength solar energy, Earth IR loads incident on a spacecraft cannot \nbe reflected away from radiator surfaces with special thennal-control coatings, since \nthe same coatings would prevent the radiation of waste heat away from the spacecraft. \nBecause of this, Earth-emitted IR energy can present a particularly heavy backload on \nspacecraft radiators in low-altitude orbits. \n\nUsually the spacecraft is warmer than the effective Earth temperature, and the net \nheat transfer is from spacecraft to Earth. However, for analysis, it is convenient to \nignore Earth when calculating radiant heat rejection from the spacecraft to space and \nto assume that Earth does not block the view to space. Then the difference in IR energy \nis added back in as an \"incoming\" heat rate called Earth-emitted lR. \n\nAnother significant fonn of environmental heating is known as free molecular \nheating (FMH). This is a result of bombardment of the vehicle by individual molecules \nin the outer reaches of the atmosphere. For most spacecraft, FMH is only encountered \nduring launch ascent just after the booster's payload fairing is ejected. It is desirable \nto drop the fairing as soon as possible after launch to minimize the amount of d~d \nweight the booster must deliver to orbit. The point at which the fairing is separated IS \n\n\n\ni i \n\n434 Spacecr3ft Subsystems 11.s \n\noften determined by a trade-off between the desire to save weight and the need to \nprotect the spacecraft from excessive atmospheric heating. Some spacecraft also \nexperience FMH if they have exceptionally low perigee altitudes or use aerobraking \nmaneuvers that cause them to dip into a planet's atmosphere. In most cases, FMH \neffects can be tolerated by the on-orbit thermal design so that no special thermal design \nchanges are required to protect the spacecraft from it. \n\nEnvironment of Interplanetary Missions \n\nInterplanetary trajectories can expose spacecraft to a range of thermal \nenvironments much more severe than those encountered in Earth orbit. During most \nof an interplanetary cruise, the only environmental heating comes from direct sunlight, \nwhich falls off as the square of the distance from the Sun. During a flyby, or after a \nspacecraft is placed into orbit around a planet, it is also exposed to IR and albedo loads \nfrom the planet. \n\nPlanetary and lunar IR and albedo environments are given in Table 11-45B. They \nvary widely due to the various planet's different distances from the Sun and different \natmosphere and surface characteristics. Gilmore [2002] provides a detailed character-\nization of the thermal environments of the planets. \n\nTABLE 11-45B. Albedo and IR Emission of the Planets.

Solar reflectors such as second-surface mirrors and white \npaints or silver- or aluminum-backed teflon are used to minimize absorbed solar \nenergy, yet emit energy almost like an ideal blackbody. To minimize both the absorbed \nsolar energy and infrared emission, polished metal such as aluminum foil or gold plat-\ning is used. On the interior of the vehicle, if it is desired to exchange energy with the \ncompartment or other equipment, black paint is commonly used. Thus, the existing \nstate of the art uses a rather wide variety of coatings which have wavelength dependent \n\n11.5 Thermal 435 \n\nthermal properties. The problems of in-space stability, outgassing, and mechanical \nadhesion to the substrate have been resolved for most coatings. There are many fully \nqualified coatings, so development and qualification of a new coating for a new design \nis normally unnecessary. . \n\nThe external surfaces of a spacecraft radiatively couple the spacecraft to space. \nBecause these surfaces are also exposed to external sources of energy such as sunlight \nand Earth-emitted IR, their radiative properties must be selected to achieve an energy \nbalance at the desired temperature between spacecraft internal dissipation, external \nsources of heat, and reradiation to space, as illustrated in Fig. 11-16. \n\nfinish determines a, E \n\nEnvIronmental heat loads (0extemaJ) \n.# A a (solar + albedo) \n~ Ae(JR) \n\nEnvironmental loads +:E~ = Reradiated energy \n(Steady stete) \n\nRg.11-16, Radiator Energy Balance (no external blockage). Note that we must.select \nradiative properties of the spacecraft surface to achieve an energy bal!mce among \nspacecraft Internal dissipation, external heat sources and reradiation to space to \nobteln the desired temperature. \n\nThe two primary surface properties of importance are the IR emissivity, Eo and the \nsolar absorptivity, a. Table 11-46 shows the range of\"properties available for some \ncommon surface finishes. Two or more coatings are sometimes combined in a \ncheckerboard or striped pattern to obtain the desired combination of average absorp-\ntivity and emissivity if it can not be obtained in a single material . \n\nAs an example, the average temperature of a sphere at 1 AU from the Sun can be \ncalculated'as follows: \n\ncr T4= (ale) x S x (ApIA) (11-10) \n\nwhere cr is the Stefan Boltzmann's constant, 5.670 51 X 1(r8 Wfm2 K4,~ is the pr0-\njected area. A is the total area, and S = 1367 W/m2 (the solar constant). For a sphere, \nYA=nr2/4nr2 =0.25. If the sphere is painted withZ93 white, ale= 0.17/0.92 and \nT = -90\u00b0C. For a sphere painted with Z306 black, a Ie = 0.921 0.89 and T = 8 DC. \n\nThermal control finishes are affected in orbit by charged particles. ultraviolet \nradiation, high vacuum, and the contaminant films that deposit out on almost all space-\ncraft surfaces. The general result of these processes is an increase in solar absorptivity \nwith little or no effect on infrared emissivity. ~s is normally undesirable from a \n\n\n\n436 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.s \n\nTABLE 11-46.

These radiators, which are oversized to handle the high solar loads at \n\"end-of-Iife,\" cause the spacecraft to run much cooler in the early years of the mission, \nsometimes necessitating the use of heaters to avoid under-temperatures of electronic \ncomponents. The degradation is, therefore, a problem not only because of the solar \nload, but also because of the change in load over the course of the mission. The stabil-\nity of coating properties is important in order to both limit maximum temperatures and \nminimize heater-power requirements. \n\nInsulation \n\nMultilayer insulation (MLI) and single-layer radiation shields are among the most \ncommon thermal control elements on spacecraft. MLI blankets are used either to \nprevent excessive heat loss from a component or excessive heating from environ-\nmental fluxes or rocket plumes. Most spacecraft are covered with MLI blankets, with \n\nU.5 Thermal 437 \n\ncut-outs provided for radiator areas to reject internally generated waste heat. MLI \nblankets are also typically used to protect internal propellant tanks, propellant lines, \nsolid rocket motors, and cryogenic dewars. Single-layer radiation barriers are some-\ntimes used in place ofMLI where a lesser degree 01 thermal isolation is required, since \nthey are lighter and cheaper to manufacture. For applications requiring insulation \nunder atmospheric conditions, foam, batt, and aerogel materials are generally used \nbecause MLl is not very effective in the presence of a gas. \n\nMultilayer insulation is composed of multiple layers of low-emittance films with \nlow conductivity between layers, as shown in Fig. 11-17 A. The simplest construction \nis a layered blanket assembled from embossed, thin mylar sheets (114 mil thick) with \na vacuum-deposited aluminum finish on one side of each sheet. The embossing results \nin the sheets touching only at a few points, thereby minimizing conductive heat paths \nbetween layers. The layers are aluminized on one side only, so that the mylar can act \nas a low-conductivity spacer. Higher-performance construction uses mylar film \nmetallized on both surfaces (aluminum or gold) with silk or dacron net, Tissuglas \npaper, or \"Super-Flock\" whiskers as the low-conductance spacers. Testing doneatJPL \nshowed that replacing the flat aluminized mylar/dacron spacers with embossed \naluminized Kapton and no spacers decreased the effectiveness of the blankets tested \nby 19% [Lin, Stultz, Reeve, 1995]. \n\nOuter \n\nUgh~~~!~~~Ii~~~~;;~~~~~~~~ Metallzed Netting spacer \u2022 \u00b7 \u00b7 15 to 20 reflectorl \nspacer layers, total \n(If necessary) : \n\nMetallzed \nNetting spacer \n\nInner cover \nStructure \n\n\u00b7 \nNote: DetaIls and features are shown for mustr&tIon \n\nand wID vary with actual design and installation. \n\nFIg. 11-17A. Composition of a Typical MU Blanket. Multilayer insulation blankets are made \nof fairly sophisticated layers of low-emittance mms with low conductivity between \nlayers. (Courtesy NASA) \n\nFigure 11-i 7B illustrates theoretical and experimental data for embossed alumi-\nnized (one surface) mylar insulation versus number of insulation-blanket layers. The \nemittance for a multilayer blanket theoretically varies inversely with one over one plus \nthe number of layers. However, in practice, simply increasing the number of layers \npast a certain value will not improve performance. As the number of layers increases, \nradiative heat transfer becomes small compared to conductive \"shorts\" between layers \nand other losses. Thus, a point of diminishing returns is reached. Considering these \ntrends, about 25 layers are usually sufficient to obtain a minimum overall conductance \nvalue. \n\nIn well-controlled laboratory tests, it is possible to achieve values of 0.005 or lower \nfor the effective emittance, e*. However, when a blanket is configured for spacecraft \napplicati~n, experience has shown that an e* of 0.015 to 0.030 is typical for medium-\nsized area applications. As the size of the application increases, the relative perfor-\nmance generally increases. This results from the smaller relative influences of heat \n\n\n\n438 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.s \n\n0.05 \n\n\\.ifOAO Installed \n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 ,{OAO Installed \n\n0.01 o '.g, LM Installed 0 ~LM blanket tests \nI 8 Inc! supports \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 Vents and seams \nE .005 o '. 0 e 0 \nCD l:LM ~ tests bare i \n~ \n\n0 blanket \n\n.001 \n\n.0005 \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 \nNumber of aiuminlzed Mylar layers \n\nRg.11-17B.

Performance data from cryogenic tankage and controlled calorimeter tests \ntypically show performance of e* down to 0.002. Control of discontinuities through \nthe design and fabrication of insulation joints and penetration is crucial to the problem \nof reducing the effective emittance of multilayer blankets. Small area blankets show \nhigh effective emittance along with considerable manufacturing variation. Very small \nblankets used to wrap propellant lines typically have effective emittances ranging \nfrom 0.05 to 0.30, making low emittance surface finishes a simpler and equally effec-\ntive alternative for internal propellant lines. External lines that are exposed to sunlight \nmay still require MLI blankets, however, to avoid overheating that might be caused by \nthe high absorptancelemittance ratios typical of low emittance surface\u00b7 finishes. \n\nMissions involving planetary landers, rovers, or atmospheric probes usually require \ninsulation that performs well in the presence of an atmosphere. While MLI may still \nbe required to protect the hardware during interplanetary cruise, foam, batt, or aerogel \nmaterials are generally added to provide insulation after atmospheric entry and landing \nin situations where ambient pressure is expected to be high enough to substantially \ndegrade MLI performance. If atmospheric pressure and gravity are low .enough, \nsimple trapped gas spaces alone IDllY be sufficient to limit heat loss to the surround-\nings. The underlying principle behind aU of these insulation types is to trap gas within \nvolumes small enough to eliminate convection effects: Total heat transfer is thereby \nlimited to what can conduct through the low conductivity insulation material and gas \nand radiate across the insulation through a process of multiple absorptions and \nemissions within the insulation material structure. To complicate MLI design further \neach layer must be grounded to reduce the chance of electrostatic discharge. \n\n11.5 Thermal 439 \n\nRadiators \nMost spacecraft waste heat is rejected to space by radiators. These occur in several \n\ndifferent forms, such as spacecraft structural panels, flat-plate radiators mounted to the \nside of the spacecraft, or panels that are deployed after the spacecraft is on orbit. \nWhatever the configuration, all radiators reject heat by IR radiation from their \nsurfaces. The radiating power is dependent on the emissivity. of the surface and its \ntemperature. The radiator must reject both the satellite waste heat plus any radiant-heat \nloads from the environment or other spacecraft surfaces that are absorbed by the radi-\nator, as shown in Fig. 11-16. Most radiators are therefore given surface fInishes with \nhigh IR emissivity (> 0.8) to maximize heat rejection and low solar absorptivity \u00ab 0.2) \nto limit heat loads from the Sun. Typical finishes include quaitz mirrors, silvered or \naluminized teflon, and white paint. \n\nThe radiating power of a radiator is a strong function of temperature. The total heat \nleaving a radiator surface is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann equation: (See Sec. 9_2.) \n\nQ = e CT AT4 (11-11) \nwhere A is the surface area, eis emissivity, Tis the absolute temperature, and CT is the \nStefan-Boltzmann constant (5.670 51 x lo-B W/m2 K4). \n\nThe T4 term results in a large increase in radiating capability with temperature, as \nshown in Fig. 11-18. The radiating power at 50\u00b0C is about twice that at 0 \u00b0C. At cryo-\ngenic temperatures the effect is even more pronounced, with a 70 OK\" radiator having \nonly 1I300th the heat rejection capability of a room-temperature radiator. This makes \ncryogenic radiators extremely sensitive to environmental heating and heat leaks \nthrough insulation and supports, and leads to special design considerations. \n\n1~r------.-------.------.-------~ \n\nf 1000 \nlBOO \n\n1 BOO \nm400 \n::t: ~ \n\nRg.11-18. Blackbody Radiator Heat ReJection. Heat rejection or heat radiating capabOity \nIncreases with temperature. For example, the radiating capability at 50 \u00b7C Is about \ntwice that of a surface at 0 \u00b7C. \n\n\u00b7The metric unit of temperature is the Kelvin, K, which is measured in the same units as the \nCelsius scale, \u00b7C, but starts at absolute zero. By definition, O\"C = 273;15 K. In correct metric \nusage, the word \"degree\" is used with the Celsius scale, but not with the Kelvin scale. For \nexample, \"0 degrees Celsius equals 273.15 Kelvin\" is correct, while \"0 degrees Celsius equals \n273.15 degrees Kelvin\" is incorrect. Unfortunately, K is widely used in astronautics both for \n1024 in computer systems analysis and for $1000 in cost analysis. (Of course, k is the metric \nprefix for 1000.) To avoid confusion, we use \"K and\"C throughout However, many of the \nreferences correctly omit the ..,.. symbol when using the Kelvin scale. \n\n\n\n440 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.s \n\nMost spacecraft radiators reject between 100 and 350 watts of spacecraft internally \ngenerated electronics waste heat per square meter. The upper end of this range is \ntypical of a radiator that runs at a fairly high temperature (say 40 DC) and experiences \nrelatively modest heat backload from the environment or other spacecraft surfaces . \n\n. The lower end of the range represents a radiator running below room temperature in \nlow-Earth orbit, where environmental backloads can be substantial. The actual sizing \nis determined by a thermal analysis that considers the desired operating temperature, \nworst-case satellite waste heat, environmental heating, and radiative and conductive \ninteractions with other spacecraft surfaces. Weights allocated for radiators typically \nvary from almost nothing, if an existing structural panel is used as a radiator, to around \n12 kglm2 for a heavy deployable radiator and its support and deployment structure. \n\nHeaters \n\nIdeally, thermal control of a satellite or component would be achieved using only \npassive techniques, such as surface finishes. Unfortunately, orbital and seasonal vari-\nations in environment and component heat-generation rates, along with degradations \nof surface finishes over time, can drive temperature variations in a passive design to \nranges larger than some components can withstand. Because of this, heaters are \nsometimes required to protect components from cold-case environmental conditions \nor to make up for heat that is not dissipated when an electronic box is turned off. \nHeaters may also be used with thermostats or solid-state controllers to provide \nprecise temperature control of a particular component A third common use for heaters \nis to warm components to their minimum operating temperatures before they are \nturned on. \n\nThe most common type of heater used on spacecraft is the patch heater, several of \nwhich are shown in Fig. 11-19A. It consists of an electrical resistance element \nsandwiched between two sheets of flexible electrically insulating material,such as \nKapton. The patch may have one circuit, or more than one, depending on whether \nredundancy is required within the patch. Redundancy is generally required on space-\ncraft systems since heater circuits can fail. Sometimes the redundancy is provided \nwithin the patch and sometimes it is provided by using two separate patches. The patch \nheaters shown in the figure illustrate the custom shapes to which these heaters may be \nmade. In most instances, however, a simple rectangular patch of some standard dimen-\nsion is used. \n\n(A) Patch Heaters (8) Cartridge Heater \n\nFIg. 11-19. Types 01 Heaters. Patch and cartridge heaters Bre used on many spacecraft to meet \nthe heating needs of different types of equipment These heaters are very Important \nto the successful operation of key components, so we often\u00b7 use redundancy to \nIncrease rellabDIty of these devices. \n\nA cartridge heater is another type that is often used to heat blocks of material or \nhigh-temperature components such as hydrazine-thruster catalyst beds. Such a heater \n\nU.5 Thermal 441 \n\n. shown in Fig. 11-19B and consists of a wound resistor enclosed in a cylindrical \n:etallic case. A hole is typically drilled in the compo~ent ~o be heated and the \nartridge potted into the hole. Another attachment technIque mv.olves the use of a \n~lamp or small bracket to hold the heater. These heaters are typically a quarter inch \ndiameter or less and up to a few inches long. \n\nAlmost all heater systems have some sort of switch or control. This typically \ninvolves a relay .that is commandable from the ground to enable or disable power to \nthe heater, a fuse to protect the spacecraft from a short circuit, and, most commo~y, a \nthermostat or solid-state controller to turn the heater on and off at predetermined \ntemperatures. More sophisticated satellites sometimes use their on-board computer to \nmonitor temperatures and turn heaters on and off as appropriate using relays. \n\nThe sinJplest arrangement involves only the heater, a fuse, and a ground com-\nmandable relay to turn the heater on and off. This arrangement is typically used for \nheaters that are activated only for special events, or for heaters that can be left on all \nthe time. A typical application is heating up the catalyst beds on hydrazine thrusters to \n100 DC before the thruster is fired. (Firing the thruster with a low initial catalyst-bed \ntemperature decreases the catalyst life.) The heater is commanded on, the catalyst-bed \nis heated, the thruster is fired, and the heater is turned off until the next maneuver, all \nunder ground control. \n\n(A) Elmwood Thermostat (8) TAYCO Solid-State Controller \n\nFIg. 11-20. Common Control Devices. MechanIcal thermostats are typ!caUy used to control the \noperation of heaters on a spacecraft. Mechanical thermostats are faIr!y reliable but \ntYP!caIly we have a large number of them on a spacecraft (up to several hundred on \nsome spacecraft) consequently we see occasional on-orbit faDures. Because of this \nand increasIng spacecraft life requirements, soUd state controUers are becoming \nmore common. \n\nHistorically, the most common control device is a mechanical thermostat, such as \nthe one shown in Fig. 11-20A. These typically consist of a small hermetically sealed \ncan containing a switch driven by a snap-action bimetallic actuator. The temperature \nat which the thermostat clicks on, known as its set point, is fixed for any given \nthermostat The engineer can select from an array of standard thermostats available \nfrom the manufacturer to get a set point close to what is desired, or a custom device \ncan be ordered. In addition to the set point, the dead band, or the difference between \nthe temperatures at which the thermostat turns on and turns off, is important A smaller \ndead band reduces the temperature swing of the device being heated and reduces \npower consumption a little (since the average temperature is lower). On the other hand, \nthe smaller dead band also increases the number of cycles on the thermostat itself and \n\n\n\n442 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.s \n\ndecieases its reliability. In any event, dead bands less than 4 \u00b0C are not recommended \ndue to problems that have occurred in the past Small dead bands have been known to \nincrease the chance of \"dithering,\" in which the thermostat rapidly cycles on and off. \nThis is a failure condition that can cause the set point to drift lower, resulting in an \nundertemperature of the component being controlled. \n\nEven though thermostats are fairly reliable, the large number of them that may be \npresent on a typical spacecraft (up to several hundred) results in occasional on-orbit \nfailures. Because of this, and increasing spacecraft life requirements, solid-state \ncontrollers are becoming more common. Such a controller, an example of which is \nshown in Fig. 11-20B, replaces the mechanical switch with an electronic device that \nhas a higher reliability and life expectancy. TheSe are used extensively on the DMSP, \nthe Space Telescope, and the ISS. They employ a temperature sensor that can be \nlocated either at the controller or at a remote location, as desired. Another advantage \nof solid-state controllers is that extremely tight dead bands \u00ab 0.1 0c) are possible for \nvery precise temperature control, such as required on the Space Telescope. Optical \nsystems, some sensors, and electronic frequency standards often require precise \ntemperature control, which cannot be achieved with a mechanical thermostat. \n\nA number of military and scientific satellites have started to use on-board com-\nputers to control heaters. Such systems read the temperatures from telemetry sensors \nplaced throughout the vehicle and send signals to turn relay-controlled heaters on and \noff as required. This allows enormous flexibility since the control set points and dead \nbands can be adjusted on orbit by uplinking new tables to the spacecraft computer. \n\nLouvers \nLouvers are active thermal.control elements that have been used in different forms \n\non numerous spacecraft. While most commonly placed over external radiators,louvers \nmay also be used to modulate radiant heat transfer between internal spacecraft \nsurfaces, or from internal surfaces directly to space through openings in the spacecraft \nwall. In general, a louver in its fully open state allows the rejection of six times as \nmuch heat as it does in the fully closed state, with no power required to operate it. Thus \nlouvers find application where internal power dissipation varies widely as a result of \nequipment duty cycles. \n\nFIg. 11-21. Fairchild and Northrop Louver Assembly Schematic. The most commonly used \nlouvers are the \"venetian-blind\" type that are typically opened to allow heat to radiate \naway from the spacecraft and closed to keep heat from escaping. \n\nU.5 Thermal 443 \n\nThe most commonly used louver assembly is the ''venetian-blind'' type shown in \nFig. 11-21. These louvers consist of four main elements: blades, actuators, sensing \nelements, and structural elements. The louver is placed over a high emittance, low \nabsorptance spacecraft radiator to modulate the flow of radiant heat from that surface. \nBlades, which are driven by the actuators. are the louver elements that give variable-\nradiation characteristics to the radiator surface below. While closed, louvers shield the \nradiator'S view to space, but while open. they allow radiative coupling to space. The \nradiating characteristics of the radiator can be varied over the range defined by these \ntwo extreme positions \n\nThe actuators drive the blades according to the perceived radiator temperature. In \nmost louver designs, a bimetallic spiral spring drives each louver blade independently \nto ensure maximum reliability. Thus a single point failure is associated with one blade, \nnot the entire assembly. The actuator spring drives the blade angle as determined by \nthe underlying radiator temperature. A strong conductive path between the actua-\ntor and radiator is therefore sought to minimize the temperature gradient between \nthem. \n\nLouver assemblies have been designed for operation in both shadow and sunlight. \nTwo design approaches that have been followed for operation in sunlight are the use \nof a Sun shield to prevent direct solar illumination of the louver or the modification \nof the louver assembly for high temperature operation if it is directly exposed to \nsunlight. Characteristics of louvers offered by the principal vendors are shown in \nTable 11-47A. \n\nTABLE 11-47A.

The heat pipe \ncan be used to create isothermal surfaces or to spread out heat from a localized source \nuniformly over a larger area. One-way (diode) heat pipes have been tested and flown. \nas have variable-conductance heat pipes, which maintain a constant temperature \nunder varying heat load conditions. Since the driving mechanism is capillary pumping. \na relatively weak force, traditional heat pipes may be susceptible to severe per-\nformance degradation when operating under gravity or acceleration. so planning is \nneeded to facilitate ground testing. Loop heat pipes and capillary pumped loops are \nmore advanced cousins of the basic heat pipes that can provide constant temperature \noperation with varying heat loads under gravity or acceleration. \n\nTo illustrate how a heat pipe works, consider a simple horizontal heat pipe in \nequilibrium with an isothermal environment, as shown in Fig. 11-22A. The liquid in \nthe wick and the vapor in the vapor space are at saturation. If heat is applied to the \nevaporator, raising its temperature, liquid in the wick evaporates (removing some of \nthe added heat), which depresses the meniscus in the evaporator since less liquid is \npresent there. This process also raises the local vapor pressure, since it must be in \nsaturation with the heated liquid in the wick. \n\nThe difference between the increased curvature of the meniscus in the evaporator \nwick and the unchanged meniscus in the condenser wick causes a difference in capil-\n\n11.5 Thermal 445 \n\nEvaporator Transportation section Condenser \n\nFig. 11-22A. Heat Pipe SchemaUc. Heat pipes are very efficient in moving heat from one-place \nto another on the spacecraft. See text for a description of operation. \n\nlary pressure sufficient to pull liquid from the condenser wick toward the evaporator. \nThis replenishes the liquid in the evaporator wick. At the same time, heated vapor \nflows from the evaporator to the condenser; which is at a lower pressure. When this \nvapor comes in contact with cooler condenser surfaces, it condenses. This cycle is \nshown schematically in Fig. 11-22A. \n\nElements of this most basic, constant-conductance, heat pipe consist of a working \nfluid, a wick structure, and an envelope. The most common wick envelope design \nconsists of axial grooves in the wall of extruded aluminum tubing, as shown in \nFig. 11-22B. This class of wick is very susceptible to gravity effects during ground \ntesting, but is relatively inexpensive to produce and very consistent. Heat-transfer \ncapability is moderate, but sufficient for many applications. Grooves are typically \nrectangular or trapezoidal in shape, but more complex shapes such as the \"teardrop\" \nor \"keyhole\" have been extruded with difficulty. Different working fluids can be used \ndepending on the temperature range of interest. In most spacecraft applications, \nammonia is the working fluid of choice. Laptop computers, on the other hand, typi-\ncally use water in heat pipes used to cool high-power chips. \n\nTrapezoidal grooye \n\nFig. 11-22B. Grooved Heat PIpe. This is an example of the most common wicklenvelope \ndesign which consists of axial grooves in the waD of extruded aluminum tubing. \n\nThe most obvious application of a heat pipe is one requiring physical separation of \nthe heat source and sink. If a heat pipe is used, it is not necessary to mount aU hardware \nto be cooled directly on radiator panels, or to use relatively inefficient conductive \ncouplings. A closely-related class of application is that of the thermal transformer. A \nsmaIl high-powered box can be mounted on one side of a radiator with integral heat \npipes; the heat generated will be spread out over a large radiator surface. This approach \nalso permits more efficient use of available \"real estate\"-the area available for a \nradiator is seldom centered symmetrically about the heat source, facing the optimal \ndirection. \n\n\n\nJ1 \n! i 446 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.s \n\nHeat pipes have also been used to reduce temperature gradients in structures to min-\nimize thermal distortion. The telescope tube of the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory \nhad three ring-shaped heat pipes to minimize circumferential temperature gradients. \nThe ammonia/aluminum heat pipes worked throughout the eight years of mission life. \n\nThe diode heat pipe was first proposed as a means of connecting a device to two \nradiator panels 011 opposite sides of a spacecraft, with the understanding that at least \none of the radiators would be free of any direct solar load at all times during the orbit \nThe diodes would couple the device to the cold radiator, while. preventing heat from \nleaking back into the system from the radiator in the Sun. This type of thermal design \nproblem-in which heat from a temporarily warm radiator or from a failed refrigerator \nmust be kept from leaking back into the system-is an obvious application for a diode \nheat pipe. \n\nThe variable-conductance heat pipe can be used to control the amount of active \nradiator area, providing reasonably good temperature control without the use of \nheaters. This is particularly attractive if electrical power is limited, and this type of \ndesign has been flown on a number of satellites. However, if the application requires \nmaintaining a component at virtually a constant temperature, feedback control (at the \nexpense of some heater power) may be employed. A sensor on the baseplate of the \ndevice to be controlled can be routed to an on-board computer, and whenever the \ntemperature drops below the desirable range, heaters on the variable conductance heat \npipe reservoirs are activated, causing the control gas to expand and block off more of \nthe radiator area. If the temperature rises above the range desired, power to the \nreservoir heaters is reduced, increasing the active radiator area. This concept usu-\nally requires less power than using heaters directly on the box or system to be \ncontrolled. \n\nU.5.3 The Thermal Design and Development Process \nThe first step in the thermal design development process is to make an assessment \n\nof the mission and hardware requirements that will drive the design. This process \nbegins with reviewing the top-level requirements. As illustrated in Fig. 11-23, these \nimposed requirements tend to be very general statements such as: ''maintain all com-\nponents within allowable temperature ranges under all mission and test conditions\"; \n''be compatible with the mission lifetime\"; or ''provide adequate ~\". From these \ngeneral, often vague, requirements, we must derive more specific requirements that \nwill be useful in developing the thermal design. Examples of these derived \nrequirements include: \n\n\u2022 Temperature limits and reliability requirements for each component \n\u2022 Equipment power dissipations and operating modes \n\n\u2022 Range of mission orbit parameters \n\u2022 Operational satellite attitudes \n\u2022 Attitudes during stressed or failure modes \n\u2022 Launch phase configurations and attitudes \n\u2022 Ground cooling needs \n\u2022 Autonomy requirements \n\u2022 Thermal-distortion budgets \n\u2022 Launch-system interfaces \n\nU.5 Thermal 447 \n\n\u2022 Interfaces with other subsystems, such as \n- Payloads - Structures \n- Propulsion - Telemetry, tracking, and command \n- Attitude control - Computer and data handling \n- Electrical power \n\n\u2022 Contamination control \n\n\u2022 Special thermal control requirements for components such as batteries, crystal \noscillators, and sensors. \n\nOnce specific design requirements. have been identified, the thermal design \ndevelopment process illustrated in Fig. 11-23A begins. This process is a combination \nof design selection and supporting analysis. The selection of a viable thermal design \napproach may become almost intuitive for an experienced thermal engineer. Detailed \nthermal analyses are, however, always required to verify and refine the design. Expe-\nrience can minimizes the number of time-consuming analysis iterations required to \nclose in on a final design. \n\nEstablishing a preliminary thermal design for the spacecraft is usually a two-part \nprocess. The flTSt is to select a thermal design for the body, or basic enclosures of the \nspacecraft. that will serve as a thermal sink for all of the internal components. The \nsecond step is to select thermal designs for various components located both within \nand outside of the spacecraft body. \n\nAs shown in Fig. 11-23B, we begin by assuming that a passive design will \nsuccessfully meet all thermal control requirements. As discussed earlier, a wide range \nof thermal control hardware and techniques are available to achieve thermal control, \nfrom simple surface finishes to complex heat transfer and refrigeration systems. The \nspacecraft system requirements to minimize weight, cost, and test complexity while \nmaximizing reliability are usually served best by keeping the thermal design as simple \nas possible and by avoiding the use of active components. A design that n;lies only on \nsurface finishes and insulation blankets will be lighter, far less expensive to build. \nmore reliable, and easier to test than a design involving heat pipes, louvers. or refrig-\nerators. Therefore, although active components will sometimes be required, they \nshould be used only when necessary. \n\nMost three-axis stabilized spacecraft use the same basic approach to thermal \ncontrol of the spacecraft body, e.g., insulating the spacecraft from the space environ-\nment with multi-layer insulation blankets and providing radiator areas with low solar \nabsorptance and high infrared emittance to reject waste heat High-power components \nare usually mounted on the walls of the vehicle, which provides them with a direct \nconduction path to the radiating surfaces on the outside. If component powers are high \nenough, conductive doublers or heat pipes may be required to spread heat out over a \nwider area so that it can be radiated away at a reasonable temperature. Components \nmounted on shelves, panels, and structures internal to the vehicle radiate their waste \nheat to the outside walls of the spacecraft, where the heat is rejected to space. The over-\nall thermal balance of such a spacecraft is shown in Fig. 11-24. \n\nWhile an initial design is usually specified through a combination of experience \nand simple hand calculations, a thermal analysis of the design in the principal mission \nthermal environments must be performed to determine if all temperature control \nrequirements can be met. We do this by constructing analytical models, which consist \nof a geometric math model for calculating radiation interchange factors, and a thermal \n\n\n\n1 \nI \nI \n! \n\n448 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.s \n\nFlg.11-23A.

Thermal Design Approach for Typical 3-axIs Spacecraft. Most three-axis \nstabDIzecI spacecraft use an approach shown to control the thermal performance of \nthe spacecraft body. Typfcally, we insulate the spacecraft from the space environ-\nment with multi-layer insulation (MU) and provide radiator areas with low solar at>-\nsorptance and high Infrared emltlance to reject unwanted heal \n\nrequired to determine what exactly is the worst-case combination of factors, such as \norbit Sun angle, operating mode, vehicle attitude, or surface properties. A number of \nparametric runs may also be required to close-in on optimum sizing of radiators. If the \npurely passive design is found to be inadequate, we repeat the process using thermal \ncontrol hardware elements that are increasingly active in nature as illustrated in \nFig. 11-23B. Once a satisfactory design is found, estimates of thermal control \nsubsystem weight and power are made and each thermal control hardware element is \nspecified in detail. \n\n11.5.4 Thermal Control Challenges \n\nThe simplest thermal control scenario is to mount dissipative components directly \non the inner surface of the spacecraft external structura1 panels. Some, or all, of the \n~xtemal surface of the panel is used to radiate the heat load to space. Local heat loads \nmto the panel are spread over the panel area via conduction through the panel. In \nhigher heat flux situations, thicker facesheets or doubler plates may be needed. In ex-\ntreme cases, heat pipes can be used to spread the heat load and isothermalize the \nradiator or maximize radiator efficiency. \n\nAs spacecraft pack density increases, eventually not all components can be \nmo~ted to these panels and some will need to be located internally, away from the \nradIator panels. For lower power boxes. a radiative view to the spacecraft core or \nexternal radiators may provide sufficient heat transfer to maintain operating tempera-\ntures. In more extreme cases, efficient heat transport devices, such as heat pipes, will \nbe needed to maintain operational temperatures of these components. \n\nAs design complexity and performance levels increase, special thermal situations \noften occur in the design of spacecraft and instruments. Typical thermal challenges \nthat may present themselves include: \n\n\u2022 Batteries typically require cooler operating temperatures and smaller \ntemperature ranges than electronic components. For example, nickel-\nhydrogen batteries require minimill temperature differences between each cell \n\n11.5 Thermal 451 \n\nand also within the cell for efficient charging, which leads to symmetric cell \npackaging. The heater control approach usually necessitates electronic \ncontrollers to minimize cell-to-cell temperature differences. \n\n\u2022 External Mechanisms are located outside of the spacecraft where thermal \nenvironments are much more extreme. Careful consideration must be given to \nunderstanding the hot and cold scenarios. \n\n\u2022 Optical Elements generally don't like large cold temperature excursions due \nto coefficient of expansion mismatch between the optical element glass and the \nmounting substrate. For a complicated optical system, with numerous optical \nsurfaces distributed over an optical bench, bulk temperature control of the \nbench may be necessary to maintain end-ta-end alignment of the optical path. \nCold conditions may over-stress the mounting system due to coefficient of \nexpansion mismatch between the optic and mounting surface leading to \ncracked optics. In addition, any optical bench (instrument or spacecraft) \ngenerally requires thermal isolation from components mounted to it to mini-\nmize thermal distortion. \n\n\u2022 lAsers are typically a large heat source, requiring stable temperature control \nthat may need to be temperature tuned to the flight models, so adjustable con-\ntrol should be utilized. This could require electronic controllers. \n\nSome components, most usually m. detectors, operate at very cold temperatures \n(125 01( and below) and require special cooling systems to achieve this. Advanced \nthermal technologies that can be incorporated in these scenarios, include louver \nsystems, constant and variable conductance heat pipes, phase change materials, capil-\nlary loops, and loop heat pipes. Each of these technologies is explained in Sec. 115.2, \nCryogenic cooling can be accomplished by several methods: \n\n\u2022 Passive RadiDtors are based on the normal principle of radiative heat rejection \nto space; however, they must be shielded from even small environmental heat \nloads, like Earth albedo and planetary m., to be effective. Still, they are limited \nto the upper cryogenic range. Material selection is critical to prevent parasitis, \nheat leaks via conduction. Multiple stage radiators remove these parasitic heat \ninputs and the final, coldest stage provides the actual sink for the detector. \n\n\u2022 Stored Cryogens are a passive, expendable fluid or gas is used to absorb waste \nheat, usually from m. detectors. These systems are relatively cheap and reli-\nable. however, usually only viable for short or infrequent usage due to mass \nand volume constraints in packaging the cryogen. \n\n\u2022 Refrigerator Systems are active systems that use electrical power to remove \nheat over long durations. Vibration, cooling, and longevity issues must be \naddressed with these systems. \n\nMany times, the packaging of a particular electronics component yields a relatively \nhigh power per unit area of the component's footprint dimensions, thus limiting the \ntransfer of the heat into the radiator panel. During the radiator area assessment in the \nhot scenario, if the required area is somewhat greater than the footprint dimensions, \nthe heat can be spread over the required area if the panel facesheet is locally thickened \n\n\n\n452 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.5 \n\nunder the component In extreme situations, the required thickness may increase to a \npoint where a better spreading device is needed to minimize mass impact. Heat pipes \nare typically used in this situation where their large heat transport capability can \nreadily spread the heat from a large local heat source over a larger area of radiator \npanel. A drawback to these devices is that they must be arranged to allow operation \nduring ground testing. This usually requires them to be level, or a slightly adverse tilt \n(evaporator < 0.02 cm above condenser) due to their low pumping pressure from small \ndifferences in capillary forces inside the pipe. In certain situations, a pipe that is \nvertical in ground testing can still be utilized, although the heat transfer capacity will \nbe significantly reduced. These are considered passive devices since no feedback \ncontrol is needed. However, it must be understood that they will operate in the \ncold scenario as well, resulting in more heater power to maintain component \ntemperatures. \n\n11.5.5 Heat Balance Estimation \n\nA successful thermal design must include adequate radiator area to accommodate \nthe maximum operational power during the hottest operational environment without \nexceeding allowable temperatures. Heater power may be required to maintain mini-\nmum allowable temperatures during nominal operations, especially for propulsion \ncomponents and batteries. Most spacecraft also require \"survival\" heaters to survive \npotential reduced-power conditions, although component temperature allowables may \nbe much lower than in operational cases. Over the lifetime of a typical mission, varia-\ntions in thermal environments and internal power dissipation combined with degrada-\ntion of material properties can result in a large number of possible thermal scenarios. \nEarly in the conceptual design phase, it is essential that the hot and cold extremes of \nthese scenarios be identified, including variations in the operating condition of the \nspacecraft. \n\nThermal environments depend on orbital characteristics, attitude profiles, and \nspacecraft configuration. The typical range of operating environments can be grouped \nas follows: \n\n\u2022 Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) missions are usually between 400 and 800 km \naltitude. Low-inclination orbits at these altitudes have eclipse periOds that are \nfairly consistent over the life of the mission. Most Sun-synchronous missions \nhave fairly constant eclipse periods and a smaller range of Slin angles to \ncontend with, and have a \"cold side\" of the spacecraft that is never in direct \nsunlight. High inclination, non-synchronous missions have a full range of Sun \nangles, and may have weeks or months with no eclipses. Albedo and Earth \ninfrared inputs (see Table 11-45A and Sec. 11.5.1) are significant contributors \nto energy balance for LEO satellites: \n\n\u2022 Geostationary (GEO) missions generally maintain constant attitude for \nobservation or communication. The \u00b1 23.5\u00b0 angular north-south motion of the \nSun during the year results in some solar input on the north and south facing \nsides of the spacecraft, except during the equinoxes. Equinox is normally the \ncold scenario for such a mission, with an eclipse season of about 3 weeks with \ndaily eclipses up to 72 minutes, and minimal solar flux on the north and south \nsides during daylight. Usually, the other four sides (Earth, zenith, east, and \nwest) experience 12 consecutive hours of Sun per 24-hour orbit, and would be \nmuch less efficient radiator surfaces due to this variability. While on station, \n\nU.5 Thermal 453 \n\nalbedo and Earth infrared radiation amount to about 1 % of low-Earth orbit \nvalues, so they can be neglected for most applications. \n\n\u2022 High Earth Orbits can be highly eccentric with perigee as low as a few \nhundred kilometers, but the apogee may be many thousands of kilometers. \nThermal environments vary accordingly; at perigee, the albedo and IR are \ngreatest, and at apogee, only direct solar is significant for most cases. If cryo-\ngenic systems are employed, the small Earth induced heating contributions \nmust be assessed. \n\n\u2022 Interplanetary Missions can have considerable variation in solar flux, which \nvaries inversely with the square of the distance from the Sun. For example, the \nCassini mission to Saturn had a Venus flyby, so its solar constant varied from \nabout 2700 W/m2 at Venus to 15 W/m2 at Saturn. Decreasing solar intensity \npresents a huge challenge for missions to the outer planets, requiring alterna-\ntive means of spacecraft power generation that constrain available heater \npower as environments get colder. Missions to Jupiter and beyond typically \nemploy radioactive power sources, so their waste heat must be distributed \naround the satellite by the thermal subsystem. Orbiting a planet presents \nfurther complications, in. that each planet has its own albedo and infrared \nradiation characteristics as listed in Table 11-45B. \n\nRadiator Requirements \nFor most spacecraft, heat balance on radiators is the dominant factor in the thermal \n\ndesign. Radiator location and coatings can be controlled, and MLI blankets are used \nto mimimize heat inputs and outputs for other surfaces. Since the maximum available \nradiator area is constrained by the structural size of the spacecraft, hot case scenarios \nmust be assessed to ensure that sufficient radiator area is available to maintain accept-\nable temperatures. The first calculations should assess the amount of radiator area \nneeded to reject the maximum operational heat load while maintaining gradients and \ncomponent temperatures within their allowable operational mode range (including \nmargin) in the hottest environmental conditions. Sometimes, radiator requirements \nexceed the available spacecraft surface area. Extended radiators (including deploy-\nabies) may be used, but they come with a mass penalty since they must be structurally \nsupported and thermally coupled to the spacecraft. \n\nFor simplicity, most mission scenarios are initially assumed to be a steady-state \nenergy balance. Balance is achieved when all of the heat sources on a spacecraft are \nequal to the heat lost to space. Heat sources include external environmental inputs and \ninternal heat generation, while the most significant heat losses are usually the \ncontrolled heat rejection from the radiators and heat leaks from MLI insulation and \nexposed structures. The heat balance for a typical spacecraft can be estimated as \nfollows. \n\nFrom a generalized heat balance equation: \n\nQin = ~ut \n\nOexternal + Q internal = Qradiator + OMu \n(11-12) \n\n(11-13) \n\nWhere Oexrernal is the environmental heat absorbed, Qinternal is the power dissipation, \nQradiator is the heat rejected from the spacecraft primary radiator surfaces, and QMU \nis the heat lost from blankets and elsewhere on the spacecraft \n\n\n\n454 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.5 \n\nTo simplify the hot case calculation, we assume (conservatively) that the net ~u \nis negligible, so Qex1emal becomes the flux abSorbed by the radiators only. For an \nindividual radiator: \n\n(11-14) \n\nSubstituting Eq. (11-11) for QradiaJor and qex1emal A for Qextemal' the radiator heat \nbalance becomes: \n\n(11-15) \n\nwhere Q.mremal is the internal spacecraft heat, ~emal is the external environmental \nheat load on the radiator per unit area, A is the area, E is the radiator emittance, C1 is \nthe Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67051 x 10 -8 W/m2K4), and T is the radiator \ntemperature. \n\nThe external environmental load, ~emal' can be broken down into the following \nindividual heat loads: \n\n~emal = CJsolar + CJaIbedo + qEarthlR + 'M1ackload (11-16) \n\nwhere 'lrolar is the absorbed solar load per unit area, ClaIbedo is the absorbed heat load \n. per unit area, qEarthlR is the absorbed Earth IR heat load per unit area, and 'M1ackload is \nthe radiative heat load from external spacecraft surfaces (solar arrays, antennas) that \nis absorbed on the radiator. . \n\nTo size a radiator, one must calculate a value for each of the terms in Eq. (11-16). \nThe solar term, 'lrolart can be calculated as discussed in Sec. 5.1 and will not be repeat-\ned here. Earth IR and albedo loads per unit area, CJEarth IR and CJalbedo .. can be calculated \nusing the following: \n\nCJEarthlR = E IEIRFEIR \n\nCJaIbedo = a ~solar Palbedo F albedo \n\n(11-17) \n\n(11-18) \n\nwhere a and E are the absorptivity and emissivity of the radiator, IEIR and lsoJar are the \nintensity of the Earth IR and solar fluxes, and PallJedo is the Earth's albedo. Suggested \nhot and cold case values for these parameters are shown in Table 11-48A. The remain-\ning terms, FEIR and F albedo' are geometrical factors that account for the. direction of the \nradiator relative to the Earth and Sun. (See Appendix 0.2) Calculating the radiative \nbackload from other spacecraft surfaces, CJbackJo'ad' requires geometric modeling of the \nspacecraft that is beyond the scope of this discussion. Generally speaking, however, if \nthe view that a surface has to space is blocked to a substantial degree by views to other \nspacecraft surfaces, this backload term can be so large as to make the surface useless \nas a radiator. For this reason, radiators are usually located on surfaces that have a \nreasonably clear view to space. \n\nObviously, the most efficient radiator surfaces are those that minimize the external \nloads represented by the constituent terms of ~emal. Radiator coatings are therefore \ncritical to the thermal design; coatings with low solar absorptance minimize Sun and \nalbedo input, and a high emittance is required to maximize radiation to space. \nBackload on the radiator can be minimized by relative location of radiators and \nexternal components, especially solar arrays. Low-Earth orbits generally allow use of \norbit average flux values for heat balance calculations on internal compo-\nnents,since their orbit periods are short relative to the thermal time constant of the \ncomponents. \n\nU.5 .

These \nboxes have an allowable mounting surface temperature range, while operating, of -10 \nto +50 \u00b0C and a minimum non-operating temperature of -20\u00b0C. the electronics boxes \ndissipate a maximum of 500 W and a minimum of 400 W when operating and 0 W \nwhen not operating. Assume a 5-year mission in a 500 km altitude, 90 deg inclination \nEarth orbit. \n\nSolution: A nadir facing radiator will receive Earth IR and albedo heat loads along \nwith some direct solar illumination in this low-Earth orbit. The Earth IR load will be \nconstant around the orbit since the radiator is constantly facing straight down. Albedo \nwill be at a maximum near the sub-solar point and decrease to near zero as the space-\ncraft crosses the terminator. Because there is only a brief period, between eclipse \nentrance or exit and terminator crossings. when this surface will receive direct solar \nillumination at a shallow angle of incidence, we will neglect the contribution of direct \nsolar load in this calculation. (To be rigorous, one could calculate the solar load using \nthe equations provided in Sec. 5.1.) \n\nUsing Eqs. (11-17) and (11-18) and the tables in Appendix 0.2, we can calculate \nthe absorbed Earth IR and albedo fluxes for a number of points around the orbit. If we \nassume that the radiator has the 5-mil thick silver teflon surface finish commonly used \non radiators in low-Earth orbit, the radiator will have an emittance of 0.78 and a \nminimum beginning of life solar absorptance of 0.05. Because the radiator absorp-\ntance will increase over its life, however, we must also consider an end-of-life \nabsorptance value of 0.15 to account for the degradation that will occur over the 5-year \nmission. The results of these calculations are shown in Table 1148B. \n\nBecause the thermal time constant of a radiator coupled to electronics boxes is large \ncompared to the orbital period, we can size the radiator to orbit-average fluxes.

If we allow for 10 DC of analysis uncertainty margin, we can use Eq. (11-15) \nand set the sum of the maximum electronics waste heat and the heat load absorbed \nfrom the environment under hot case conditions to equal the radiator heat rejection \ncapacity at 40 DC (313 DK): \n\n500 W + (182 W/m2) A = (0.78) (5.67 x 10-11 W/m2K4) A (313 \u00b0K)4 (11-19) \n\nSolving for A, we get an area of 2.06 m2. \nTo determine if any heater power is required during normal operations, we again use \n\nEq. (11-15) to calculate the minimum temperature under cold-case conditions. We use \nthe above area with the cold case power dissipation of 400 W and cold case environ-\nmental loads from the 90 deg P angle orbit to solve for temperature: \n\n400 W + (148 W/m2) (2.06 m2) = (0.78) (5.67 x 10-11 W/m2K4) (2.06 m2) (T)4 (11-20) \n\nSolving for T, we get a cold case minimum temperature of 297 OK = 24 DC. Subtract-\ning 10 \u00b0C for analytical uncertainty gives a minimum operating radiator temperature \nof 14\u00b0C, which is well above the minimum allowable operating termperature of \n-lODe. \n\nTo determine the heater power required to keep the electronics above their \nminimum non-operating temperature limit, we add 10 DC of uncertainty margin to the \nminimum allowable non-operating termperature and use Eq. (11-15) to solve for the \npower required to keep the radiator above -10\u00b0C under cold case conditions: \n\n(XW) + (148 W/m2) (2.06 m2) = (0.78) (5.67 x 10-11 W/m2K4) (2.06 m2) (263 \u00b0K)4 (11-21) \n\nSolving for X, we get a heater power of 131 W needed to keep the electronics above \ntheir non-operating minimum temperature limit under worst-case conditions. \n\n11.5 Thermal \n\n11.5.6 Mass, Power, Telemetry Estimates \n\nMass \n\n457 \n\nHistorically, the TCS mass loosely correlates to the spacecraft dry mass or total \nspacecraft power generation capability. Typically the thermal control hardware mass \nis 2 to 10% of the spacecraft or instrument dry mass. A purely passive thermal control \napproach tends toward the lower end of the range. If active control techniques are \nused, the mass tends toward the higher end of the range. \n\nAs the complete thermal control approach is formulated and a hardware list is \ndeveloped component-level estimates can be performed to provide a more accurate \nassessment. For low-power spacecraft, the bulk of the thermal mass is usually the \nML!. but if radiator panels or heat transport systems are to be used, their mass \nshould be estimated early. Any heater controller electronics, as well as all heaters, \nwiring, and thermostats, should be included in the thermal control subsystem mass \nestimate. \n\nTABLE 11-49. Thermal Hardware Mass and Power EsUmates.

The power required for operation of dedicated \nelectronics used for thermal control should be allocated to the thermal system \nestimates. \n\n\u2022 Operational: for worst case energy balance determination, these estimates \nshould be made for the coldest operational scenario. Mechanical thermostats \nor. electronic controllers with a combination of proportional, integral, and \ndifferential functionality may provide control of these heaters. Onboard soft-\nware may also be utilized if sufficient temperature sensors are provi~ed. \n\n\n\n458 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.s \n\n\u2022 Survival: these estimates should be based on a cold survival scenario. Circuits \nshould be controlled in the most reliable (and redundant) manner, utilizing the \nminimum resources that would likely exist in this mode, e.g., reduced onboard \nsoftware capability may not allow for heater control algorithms or fault \ndetection and isolation routines. For example, hydrazine propulsion systems \nrequire protection from freezing (2 DC) at all times and should be considered \nas a survival circuit. \n\nTelemetry and Commands \nTemperature sensors that are located inside components are used to ensure the \n\ncorrect temperature information is monitored and a determination of the thermal \nhealth and safety status of the spacecraft or instrument can be made. Every effort \nshould be made to provide for sufficient temperature sensors early in the program, to \nensure that sufficient interfaces are available to read these sensors. Thermal com-\nmands are usually necessary only when electronic or software heater control is used. \nWhile commands can usually be added late in the design flow, the associated hardware \n(relays to enable or disable the circuit) must be identified early. \n\n11.6 Structures and Mecbanisms 459 \n\n11.6 Structures and Mechanisms \n\nThomas P.

Britton, \n\nLockheed Martin Astronautics \n\nThe structures and mechanisms subsystem mechanically supports all other space-\ncraft subsystems, attaches the spacecraft to the launch vehicle, and provides for \nordnance-activated separation. The design must satisfy all strength and stiffness \nreqwrements of the spacecraft and of its interface to the booster. Primary struct\\lre \ncarries the spacecraft's major loads; secondary structure supports wire bundles, pr0-\npellant lines, nonstructural doors, and brackets for components typically under 5 kg. \n\nIn this section, we describe how to develop a preliminary design for a structures \nsubsystem. We begin by considering the spacecraft's operating environments and de-\nsigning the structure with overall spacecraft packaging in mind. After conducting nu-\nmerous design trades, we then assess each structural member for its most likely failure \nmodes, possible weight savings, and need for reinforcement.

The PreDminary Design Process for Structures and Mechanisms. We move \nfrom left to right, iterating as needed, when designing the spacecraft structure. \n\n11.6.1 Structural Requirements \n\nStructures must endure environments from manufacture to the end of the mission. \nTeam members should contribute from all disciplines: engineering, manufacturing, \nintegration, test, and mission operations. This interdisciplinary approach ensures \ncoverage of all critical requiremen~ven those which seem minor. The following \ndiscussion of the Space Shuttle's external tank structure show why we should not over-\nlook any event in the structure's lifetime. \n\nThe aluminum skin of the external tank must have a very tight manufacturing \ntolerance. Adding just 0.0254 mm (0.001 in) thickness to the entire shell of its forward \ntank for liquid oxygen adds 220 kg to tank mass. Special handling fixtures must cradle \nthe tank's wall sections to keep them from collapsing during welding, as they cannot \n\n\n\nSpacecraft Subsystems 11.6 \n\nsupport their own weight. The nose section of the completed external tank experiences \nits most severe loads before launch from winds occasionally gusting against an empty \nand unpressurized tank. Table 11-50 lists typical mission phases and possible soUrces \nfor structural requirements. \n\nTABLE 11-50. Typical Sources for Structural Requirements by Mission Phase. The struc-\ntural design must account for specific loads in every phase. \n\nMission Phase Source of Requirements \n\nManufacture \u2022 Handling fixture or container reactions \nand Assembly \u2022 Stresses Induced by manufacturing processes (welding) \n\nTransport \u2022 Crane or dolly reactions \nand Handling \u2022 Land, sea, or air transport environments \n\nTesting \u2022 Environments from vibration or acoustic tests \n\u2022 Test fixture reaction loads \n\nPrelaunch \u2022 Handling during stacking sequence and pre-flight checks \n\nLaunch \u2022 Steady-state booster accelerations \nand Ascent \u2022 Vibro-acoustic noise during launch and transonic phase \n\n\u2022 Propulsion system engine vibrations \n\u2022 Transient loads during booster ignition and bum-out, stage separations, \n\nvehicle maneuvers, propellant slosh, and payload fairing separation \n\u2022 Pyrotechnic shock from separation events \n\nMission \u2022 Steady-state thruster accelerations \nOperations \u2022 Transient loads during pointing maneuvers and attitude control bums \n\nor docking events \n\u2022 Pyrotechnic shock from separation events, deployments \n\u2022 Thermai environments \n\nReentry and Landing \u2022 Aerodynamic heating \n(if applicable) \u2022 Transient wind and landing loads \n\nThe launch vehicle is the most obvious source of structural requirements, dictating \nthe spacecraft's weight, geometry, rigidity, and strength. The launch vehicle, selected \norbit, and upper stage determine the spacecraft's allowable weight. See Table 18-4 for \nlaunch-vehicle data. \n\nThe core body structure and spacecraft adapter typically account for 10% to 20% \nof a spacecraft's dry weight. Appendages, component boxes, and \"most secondary \nstructures apply to the weight of other subsystems. On the structures and mechanisms \nsubsystem, we normally increase the estimated weight by 10% for fasteners and \nfittings. We should also add approximately 25% for weight growth to account for \nprogram additions, underestimating, and inadequate understanding of requirements. \nThe spacecraft item most often underestimated or neglected is electronic wiring, \nsometimes approaching 10% of a spacecraft's dry weight. Of course, allowances for \nweight growth may vary for a component or subsystem, based on its design maturity \nand schedule risk. As subsystem designs mature, known weights replace growth \nestimates. \n\nA spacecraft's size depends on choosing the payload fairing compatible with the \nlaunch vehicle. These protective shrouds shield the spacecraft from direct air loading \n\n11.6 Structures and Mechanisms 461 \n\nand contamination. The Spacecraft and its fairing have a prescribed dynamic envelope, \nor space allocation, that takes into account expected deflection and the possible addi-\ntion of thermal protection blankets. The spacecraft must be rigid enough so the fairing \nand spacecraft do not encroach on each other's envelope. Although the Space Shuttle \ndoes not have a traditional payload fairing, its cargo bay requires a similar envelope. \nSee Fig. 18-8 for an example. \n\nThe spacecraft's rigidity requirements specify more than maximum deflection. A \nlaunch-vehicle structure has certain natural frequencies that respond to forces from \nboth internal (engine oscillations) and external (aerodynamic effects) sources. The \nlaunch vehicle contractor lists known natural frequencies for each launch vehicle (see \nTable 18-9) and describes associated axial, bending, or torsional (twisting) modes. The \nspacecraft structure tailored to avoid the launch vehicle's natural frequencies will \nexperience much lower loads. Typical resonance sources to avoid include interaction \nbetween the spacecraft and the launch vehicle's control system, oscillations in the \npropulsion system (pogo), aerodynamic buffeting during ascent, and bending of the \nsolid rocket motors. \n\nEngine thrust during launch and ascent exposes the spacecraft to steady-state \nacceleration along its axis. This acceleration steadily increases as a booster depletes \nfuel (less mass to propel), but comes to an abrupt end, or transient, at burn-out. The \nacceleration resumes suddenly, with another transient, as the next stage ignites. Wind \ngusts and vehicle maneuvers can induce lateral transients. Transients and steady-state \naccelerations cause inertial loads, commonly specified as load/actors, or multiples of \nweight at sea level. Table 18-8 shows typical load factors for severa1launch-vehicle \nevents. \n\nRandom vibration from engines and other sources is a critical source of load. At \nlift-off, the major source of random vibration is acoustic noise, which radiates from \nthe engines to engulf the vehicle. Acoustics develop from aerodynamic turbulence \nwhen the vehicle passes through the transonic portion of its flight. Structures with high \nsurface area and low mass, including skin sections and solar array panels, respond \nstrongly to acoustic noise. \n\nLoad factors do not express random vibration correctly. Three parameters that help \ndescribe random vibration are distribution, frequency content, and magnitude. Typi-\ncally we assume that a random spectrum has a Gaussian distribution, which determines \nthe percentage of time the vibration is within certain limits. The frequency content is \nmost commonly expressed as power spectral density (PSD) even though \"accelera-\ntion\" is more precise than \"power\" in this application. Vibrational power in a signal is \nproportional to acceleration-squared. This is divided by the frequency bandwidth over \nwhich the signal was integrated, to make the quantity independent of bandwidth. Thus, \nPSD is in units of g21Hz. To illustrate the power spectral density, we use a log-log plot \nof g21Hz against frequency. The square root of the area under the curve is the time \nhistory's rms value. This value equals one standard deviation, cr, of the random accel-\neration. Figure 11-26 shows a random signal, its normal distribution, and a typical \nPSD plot. \n\nPyrotechnic shock, another source ofload, comes from explosive separation events \ninvolving the boosters, payload fairing, and spacecraft, as well as release mechanisms \nfor solar panels and other deployable appendages. This shock causes high acceleration \nand high frequency over a very short time (see Fig. 18-11). Because shock loads \nattenuate quickly, they seldom damage structures removed from the immediate \nimpulse, but they may seriously harm nearby electronic components. \n\n\n\n462 Spacecraft Subsystems \n\n9 \n\n1.0 \n\n10 100 \n\n11.6 \n\n1,000 \nHz \n\nRg.11-26.

The probability density curve (center), \nwHh the same vertical scale, describes the relative likelihood of acceleration beIng \nat a given value. ThIs Is a normal dlstnbutlon, wHh each tick mark on the vertical \nscale representing a standard deviation, CT. The figure on the righ1 Is a plot of power \nspectral density. It describes the frequency content of the vibration and Is equal to \nthe mean-square acceleration (g2) In a selected frequency band divided by the \nwidth, In Hz, of that band. \n\nIn actual design, we combine math models of the spacecraft and launch vehicle to \ndo a coupled loads analysis. In this analysis, we drive the coupled model with/orcing \nfunctions (force as a function of time or frequency) that are based on measured launch-\nvehicle environments. Before we get to this point, though, we must configure the \nstructure, select from our design options, and roughly size the structure based on esti-\nmated design loads. \n\n11.6.2 Packaging and Configuring the Subsystem \n\nDesigners must trade the low weight of a high-density design against the need to \naccess individual components for testing or replacement before launch. The prelimi-\nnary arrangement should account for evety component in the design because the \nspacecraft's structure inevitably becomes heavier if it must accommodate new compo-\nnents. Added component mass multiplies through higher allowances for weight \ngrowth, heavier structure for support, and more onboard propellants for attitude \ncontrol. \n\nThe payload and the attitude control approach most strongly influence a space-\ncraft's configuration, and the launch vehicle constrains it. Chapter 9 discusses \npayloads and their requirements. Section 11.1 discusses spin- and 3-axis stabilization \nto control attitude. A spin-stabilized spacecraft influences packaging most because the \nmass moment of inertia (MOlt about the spin axis must be greater than any other axis \nto maintain stability. In 3-axis stabilized spacecraft, we must separate the magnetic \ntorque rods and the magnetometer (device that senses the Earth's magnetic field) to \npreclude any magnetic interference between them. \n\nSensing devices always require specific fields of view and pointing accuracy. The \npackaging designer must locate sensors to be unobstructed by antennas or solar arrays. \n\n\u2022 I is the standard notation for both mass moment of inertia and area moment of inertia In this \nsection, we use MOl for mass moment of inertia and I for area moment of inertia. \n\n11.6 structures and Mechanisms 463 \n\nAdvanced composite materials often help mounting-structure designs meet require-\nments for rigidity and thermoelastic distortion. \n\nCommunication antennas also require rigidity, thermoelastic stability, and a clear \nfield of view. One solution is to mount sensOIS and antennas on an appendage that is . \nstowed during launch, deployed on orbit for an unobstructed view, and constructed of \nadvanced composite materials for rigidity and thermoelastic stability. \n\nComponents for command and data handling are often vulnerable to the environ-\nments of outer space, so we usually bury them in the center of the spacecraft to shield \nagainst radiation. Interfacing wire bundles also weigh less when the processor, data \nbus, and other control components are close together. \n\nPropulsion s~systems include reaction-control assemblies and orbital transfer \nstages. By purchasing thrusters in multiaxis combinations, called rocket engine \nmodules, we can reduce the number of propellant-line welds needed on si~ during the \nspacecraft's assembly. We usually place those modules on the spacecraft's penphety-far \nfrom the spacecraft's center of mass-but we must keep them from contaminating \nsensors, antennas, and solar array cells with propellant gases. A propulsion system \nwith a low operating pressure helps lessen the. propellant tank's weight. Another \nstructural challenge is the need to support transfer stages, so the thrust vector remains \naligned with the spacecraft's center of mass. These stages are usual!y h~vy; so, \nplacing them on the bottom of the spacecraft stack, near the launch vehicle mterface, \nhelps minimize structural weight. \n\nThe configuration of the power subsystem varies with power requirements and \norbital conditions. For example, we must determine where to stow solar panels during \nlaunch and where to deploy them in orbit, so they do not touch or rest in the shadow \nof other subsystems. By using fewer folds in the panels, we can keep the deployment \nmechanisms simple and more reliable. Finally, batteries should be accessible for \npre-launch testing or replacement and placed where they will be at their optimum \ntemperature. Thermal control specialists can place components, select materials, and \nsuggest surrounding structure (open truss or closed skin panels with stiffeners) to help \ncontrol temperature. These measures help us avoid using other active temperature \ncontrol devices. \n\nH we configure the structure and package components at the same time, we may \nmake the components part of the load-carrying structure. This concurrent approach \nmay also produce better symmetry in the structure, which satisfies frequency response \nrequirements. By using common members and joints throughout the design, we can \nlower fabrication costs and more easily meet weight allocations. For example, beams \nthat make the spacecraft rigid can also support components. Establishing design routes \nfor wire bundles and propellant lines helps avoid the inefficiencies of cutting through \nstructure later. We should design special joints to connect members made with differ-\nent materials because their varying rates of thermal expansion and contraction can be \ndetrimental. Finally, the spacecraft adapter must transition smoothly from the space-\ncraft to the interface on the launch vehicle's upper stage. \n\n11.6.3 Design Options . \n\nIn designing a structure, we consider optional materials, types of structure, and \nmethods of construction. To select from these options, we do trade studies to compare \nweight, cost, and risk. \n\nA typical spacecraft structure contains metallic and nonmetallic materials. Most \nmetals are very nearly homogeneous, having constant properties throughout their \n\n\n\n464 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.6 \n\ncomposition, and isotropic, having the same properties regardless of direction. Non-\nmetals are usually formed with composites, or blends of more than one material. \nComposite materials are not homogeneous and.are normally not isotropic. \n\nMaterials are selected based on: \n\n\u2022 Strength \n\u2022 Stiffness \n\u2022 Density (weight) \n\u2022 Thermal conductivity \n\u2022 Thermal expansion \n\u2022 Corrosion resistance \n\u2022 Cost \n\n\u2022 Ductility (which can prevent cracks) \n\u2022 Fracture toughness (ability to resist \n\ncrack growth) \n\u2022 Ease of fabrication \n\u2022 Versatility of attachment options. \n\nsuch as welding \n\u2022 Availability \n\nBy far the most commonly used metal for spacecraft structure is aluminum alloy, of \nwhich there are many types and tempers. Aluminum is relatively lightweight, strong, \nreadily available, easy to machine, and low in raw material cost The stiffness-ta-\nweight ratio of aluminum is about the same as steel, but the strength-ta-weight ratio is \nusually higher. The main advantage of aluminum over steel for flight structures is its \nlower density. For the same mass, an aluminum shell or plate would be thicker and \nthus able to cany a greater compressive load before it would buckle. If we need harder \nor denser materials, we normally choose steel or titanium. \n\nAlloys are available in sheets, plates, extrusions, forgings, and castings. The pri-\nmary source of material properties is MIL-HDBK-5, Metallic Materials and Elements \nfor Aerospace Vehicle Structures [U.S. Air Force Materials Laboratory, 1994], which \ncontains many properties and statistically guaranteed strengths for all commonly used \naerospace metals. \n\nOne popular advanced composite is graphite-epoxy, which has graphite fibers for \nstrength and stiffness in an epoxy matrix. Composite fabric layers normally bond \ntogether in designed fiber orientations, so they can provide properties not available in \nhomogeneous metallic materials, including extremely high stiffness-ta-weight ratios \nand negligible expansion and contraction resulting from temperature gradients. Other \nfibers in these composites include boron, Kevlar\u2122, and glass. Graphite and boron \nfibers also reinforce metal-matrix composites. Techniques to manufacture and apply \nmetal-matrix composites are presently less advanced than for epoxy-matrix materials. \nTsai [1987] and MIL-HDBK-17 [1977, 1989] provide more information on composite \nmaterials. \n\nTable 11-51 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the most com-\nmonly used materials in spacecraft design. Table 11-52 shows their representative \nproperties. \n\nTypes of structures include skin panel assemblies, trusses, ring frames, pressure \nvessels, fittings, brackets, and equipment boxes. Sometimes only one meets objec-\ntives; but we usually have several options. We use monocoque structures, which are \npanels .and shells without attached stiffening members, only if applied and reacted \nloads are spread out rather than concentrated. A semimonocoque shell has lightweight, \nclosely spaced stiffening members (stiffeners) that increase its buckling strength. Skin-\nstringer structures have longitudinal members (stringers) and lateral members \n(frames) to accept concentrated loads and skin to spread those loads out and to transfer \nshear. A truss is an assembly that remains stable under applied concentrated loads with \nits structural members loaded only axially. A sandwich structure is a panel or shell \n\n11.6 Structures and Mecbanisms 465 \n\nTABLE 11-51.

Section 15.3 of Sarafin [1995] \nprovides guidance for selecting the above types of structures. \n\nWe can attach structural elements with adhesive bonds, welds, or mechanical \nfasteners. But regardless of the selected structure type and method of attachment, \nmuch of the structural subsystem's weight will be in the fittings used to transfer load \nfrom one member to another. \n\nMOst composite material structures have metal end fittings or edge members \nattached by bonding, but the bond's strength depends on the process and workman-\nship. Normally, we must select a proper bonding process through development testing. \nWe can use bolts instead; however, local stress concentrations around the fasteners can \ncause failure at load levels much lower than a composite material can otherwise sus-\ntain. Welding is also possible for most aluminum alloys, but heat from welding can \nlower material strength near welds by more than 50%. If we need stiffness more than \nstrength, we may choose welding over mechanical joints. As with bonding, welding \nprocesses require strict development, control, and testing. \n\nThe strength of mechanical fasteners, such as rivets and bolts, is very dependable \nas a result of process controls, inspections, and frequent sample testing.

Many similar guidelines help us design a dependable \nstruCtural joint. \n\n11.6.4 Structural Design Philosophy and Criteria \n\nTo develop a structure light enough for flight, and to keep spacecraft affordable, we \nmust accept some risk of failure. Material strengths vary because of random, undetect-\nable flaws and process variations, and loads depend on unpredictable environments. \nRandom variables affect the adequacy of most structures, such as a dam whose load \ndepends on how much it rains; but for space missions, we must accept a higher prob-\nability of failure than for most other types of structures. Launch loads are affected by \nmany different random variables, such as acoustics, engine vibrations, air turbulence, \nand gusts, and we seldom have enough data to confidently model the probability \ndistributions of these variables_ \n\nBecause of loads uncertainty, we cannot accurately quantify the structural reliability \nof a spacecraft. We can approximate it, however, and we can develop design criteria \nthat will provide acceptable reliability. Let us work backwards from a subsystem-level \nreliability to understand how conservative our design approach should be for an indi-\nvidual structural part. \n\nIf we select a goal for structural reliability of 99% (we probably should aim higher), \nwhich means there is a 1 % chance of a mission-ending structural failure, we must \ndesign each structural element to much higher reliability. If the structure has 1,000 \nparts whose failure would jeopardize the mission, and if their chances of failure are \nindependent, each must have 99.999% reliability (0.999991000 = 0.99, from probabil-\nity theory). This explains why design criteria may appear so conservative_ To achieve \nappropriate reliability, many programs use the following ground rules: \n\n\u2022 Use a design-allowable strength for the selected material that we expect 99% \nof all specimens will equal or exceed. \n\n\u2022 From available environmental data, derive a design limit load equal to the \nmean value plus three standard deviations_ This means there will be 99_87% \nprobability that the limit load will not be exceeded during the mission, assum-\ning tIie load variability has a Gaussian distribution. Because data will be \nlimited, wI? can only approximate the true probability level of the design load; \nbut \"3-sigma\" remains the goal. (Some programs aim for 99% probability \ninstead of3cr.) \n\n\u2022 Multiply the design limit load by a factor of safety, then show that the stress \nlevel at this load does not exceed the corresponding allowable strength_ \n\n\u2022 Test the structure to verify design integrity and/or workmanship, to correlate \nanalytical models, and to protect against human errors. \n\nTable 11-53 summarizes the criteria used to design space structures_ \nSpace programs use different factors of safety. but mQst recognize the need to \n\nbalance the factors with the type of structure and scope of testing. Factors of safety are \nhighest for pressure vessels and for structures we will not test. For most other \nstructures, a contractor will be able to choose from several test options. Table 11-54 \nshows the test options for an unmanned launch. If personnel safety is at risk, as for a \nShuttle launch or during ground handling, we use higher factors. \n\n\n\n468 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.6 \n\nTABLE 11-53. Terms and Criteria Used In Strength Analysis. We design space structures to \nmeet specified or selected criteria for preventing yield and ultimate failures. A \nyield (aOure Is one in which the structure suffers permanent deformation that \ndegrades the mission; ultimate failure Is rupture or coDapse. Two factors of \nsafety-one for yleld and one for ultimate-typically apply to a structural assem-\nbly, and depend on the selected test option (Table 11-54). For each structur8i \nmamber, the allowable load, the design load, and the margin of safety each have \ntwo values, one for yleld and one for ultimate. \n\nTerm DefinlUon \n\nLoad Factor A multiple of weight on Earth, representing the force of inertia thet resists \nacceleration. The load factor appfies in the direction opposite that of the \nacceleration. For example, an object under an acceleration of 5 g, where \ng is the gravitational acceleration, has a load factor of -5; if that object \nweighs 500 N (a mass of 51 kg), the force it exerts on its support structure \n1s-2,5oo N. \n\nUmitLoad The maximum load expected during the mission or for a given event, at a \n(or design limit load) specified or selected statistical probabnity (typically 99% for expendable \n\nlaunch vehicles and 99.87% for launches with humans aboard). The load \ncan be acceleration, load factor, force, or moment \n\nAnowabie Load or The highest load or stress a structure or material can withstand without \nStress failure, based on statistical probability (usuaRy 99%; I.e., only 1 % chance \n\nthe actuaJ strength is less than the aRowable). \n\nFactor of Safety, FS A factor applied to the limit load to obtain the design load for the purpose \nof decreasing the chance of failure. \n\nDesign Load Umit load multiplied by the yleld or ultimate factor of safety; this value \nmust be no greater than the corresponding allowable load. \n\nDesign Stress Predicted stress caused by the design load; this value must not exceed \nthe corresponding allowable stress. \n\nMargin of Safety, MS A measure of reserve strength: \n\nMS = Allowable load (or stress) \nDesign load (or stress) \n\n1 ~ 0 to satisfy design criteria \n\nTABLE 11-54. Typical Test Options and Factors of Safety for Missions wHhout Humans \nAboard. [DoD-HDBK-343]. See Table 11-53 for definitions and use. \n\nDesign Factors of Safety \n\nOption YIeld Ultimate \n\n1.

No structural test 1.6 2.0 \n\nTypically, a program Win vary the test option for different components depending \non ~ of structure, material or method of construction, weight criticality, perceived \ntest difficulty, program schedule, and planned quantity of flight articles. \n\nWe should proof test (option 2) each flight article if strength is significantly af-\nfected by workmanship or process variations. The test conditions should apply the \n\n11.6 structures and Mechanisms 469 \n\ncritical stresses in all load directions possible during the mission. Proof tests should \nalso include the effects of predicted temperature changes during the mission, which \ncan be significant in certain types of structures. Proof testing is the only viable option \nfor advanced composite structures and bonded joints, unless we can become confident \nthat our processes are controlled well enough to keep strength variations low. We also \nproof test all pressure vessels. \n\nIf strength is relatively insensitive to workmanship, such as for most mechanically \nfastened metals, we can choose any of the four test options. When building many arti-\ncles, we can save money by testingjust one (option 3), but this option carries a weight \npenalty because of its high factors of safety. Alternatively, we can build a dedicated \nqualification article and use the lower factors of safety that go with the \"Ultimate Test\" \n(option 1). With this approach, we have three additional benefits: \n\n1. We can shorten the flight-article development schedule by conducting the \ntest program in parallel. \n\n2. We can use the test article as a pathfinder for launch-site operations. \n3. The impact of test failure is not as severe. \n\nWe must weigh these advantages against the cost of building the test article, for which \nwe must use the same processes as for the flight structure. \n\nOption 4 (''No Test\") can be risky, and we must use it with caution. The space \nindustry has no design codes, such as for many commercial structures, and relies \nheavily on testing to verify structural integrity. Without a test, a critical analysis error \nor oversight could lead to a mission-ending structural failure, even with high factors \nof safety. However, with caution, we can confidently use this option for relatively sim-\nple structures. The \"no test\" option may be most cost effective for structures designed \nfor stiffness rather than strength. \n\nTo provide confidence the structure will survive multiple loading cycles, we also \nperform fatigue analysis. Fatigue is a much greater concern for aircraft than for most \nprimary structures in a spacecraft because launch is of such short duration. But if \nstresses are high enough, it does not take many cycles for a material to fatigue, and \nlaunch is not the only event that can cause fatigue damage. Ground testing and trans-\nportation can significantly degrade service life. Structures sensitive to high-frequency \nvibrations or on-orbit thermal cycling are particularly susceptible to fatigue. \n\nAll materials have internal defects, most of which are microscopic. The number, \nsizes, and locations of these defects all contribute to high variability in fatigue life \nbetween specimens of the same material. In a fatigue analysis, we compare the number \nof cycles at the limit stress level with the test-determined average number of cycles at \nwhich failure occurs. We account for variability in a material's fatigue life by multi-\nplying the predicted number of load cycles over the mission life by a scatter factor of \nfour [Rolfe and Barsom, 1977]. \n\nTo account for the possibility of a large pre-existing flaw in a critical location of a \nstructural part, we can establish afracture control program. This includes inspections \nof raw materials and fabricated parts for defects, special handling procedures for \ncritical parts, andfracture-mechanics safe-life analysis. This analysis, which is a semi-\nempirical method of predicting crack growth and part life, is more conservative than \nfatigue analysis because we assume an initial crack exists at the location of peak stress. \nWe set the size of the assumed initial crack equal to the minimum our inspection \nmethods can reliably detect. MIL-HDBK-5G provides fatigue and fracture mechanics \ndata for most metals. \n\n\n\n470 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.6 \n\n11.6.5 Preliminary Sizing of Structoral Members \n\nTo size the structural members of a spacecraft, we consider stiffness, strength, and \nweight We will rarely find a design in the first iteration that is acceptable for all three. \nBefore the design is final, we will perform many iterations that also consider fatigue \nlife, cost. and changes in subsystem requirements. \n\nStiffness-Flexibility is a measure of how much a structure deflects under unit \nload. Stiffness is a measure of force required to cause a unit displacement. (For a \nsingle-degree-of-freedom system, stiffness is the inverse of flexibility.) A structure's \nmode shapes and natural frequencies of vibration depend on its stiffness and mass \nproperties. We discussed typical considerations for stiffness in Sec. 11.6.1. \n\nWe can estimate the primary frequencies of a stowed spacecraft by representing it \nwith an equivalent beam, which simulates mass properties and core stiffness, then \nusing simple beam-frequency equations provided in Sec. 11.6.6. As the design \nevolves, we construct a finite element model (a mathematical representation of the \nstructure) to obtain more accurate predictions of mode shapes and frequencies. For a \ngiven mode of vibration, most finite element software can identify the locations in a \nstructure that have the most strain energy, which is the energy absorbed when a struc-\nture deforms under load. Reinforcing the areas with high strain energy is the most \nefficient way to stiffen a structure. \n\nA structural assembly is usually more flexible than predicted by a math model \nbecause of local flexibility in mechanical attachments. Thus, even if our model dem-\nonstrates the design is adequate, we may find out during testing that the structure \ndoesn't meet stiffness requirements. It usually doesn't cost much in weight to stiffen \na joint-the key is being aware of stiffness in the design of attachments. We should \nalso not cut a stiffness requirement too close before verifying it by test. \n\nStrength-We can use various methods to predict distributions of intemalloads, \ndepending on the structure's complexity and the scope of our analysis. Free-body \ndiagrams show applied load, which in preliminary design equals weight multiplied by \nload factor at the center of gravity, and the reactions necessary for static equilibrium. \nWith these diagrams, we can easily determine member loads in a statically determi-\nnate structure, which has just one solution for member loads that satisfies equilibrium. \nFinite element analysis is the most efficient method of predicting loads in a statically \nindeterminate structure, which has redundant load paths. \n\nTo have adequate strength, the structure must not rupture, collapse, or deform such \nthat its function is impaired. Primary structural members made of ductile materials \nseldom rupture in tension for two reasons: (l) Most structures are statically indetermi-\nnate, and ductile materials will stretch enough prior to failure for loads to redistribute. \n(2) Tension is an easy mode of failure to assess for a member of constant cross-section \nand is seldom overlooked. Instead, tension members fail most often at their attach-\nments: fittings, welds, fasteners, and adhesives. \n\nStability is a structure's resistance to collapsing under compression. Compressive \nfailures are the most sudden and catastrophic, and they are often the hardest to predict. \nAn overall instability failure of a column is called buckling. This is the kind offailure \nwe would expect if we pushed on the ends of a long, slender rod. The load at which a \ncolumn buckles decreases with the square of its length. Crippling is a compression \nfailure that starts with local buckling of thin-walled flanges or webs in a member's \ncross-section. \n\nWe often design panels in skin-stringer structures to buckle under compressive \nloads, with shear being transf~ by diagonal tension. This is a common practice for \n\n11.6 Structures and Mechanisms \n471 \n\neight-critical structures and is not catastrophic if we design the rivets, stringers, and \n~e members properly. Diago~al tensi~n will in~uce lateral loads in edge members \nthat cause compression and bending, as discussed m Bruhn [1973]. \n\nWe also must check that structural elements do not yield, or take on permanent \ndeformations that can jeopardize the mission. Yie~ding is a c~~teristic of all \ntruCturaI materials except those that are perfectly brittle (no ductility). Other defor-\n~tions can be detrimental as well, such as shifting in mechanical joints, so we must \nassess them as well. ... .. \n\nWhen assessing rupture and collapse, we use desIgn ulttmate loads, which are limit \nloads multiplied by the ultimate factor of safety. We ~ th~ yi~ld fa~or of safety to \nassess permanent deformations. The onset of compressIve yteldmg will o~ be fol-\nlowed by collapse because of reduced stiffness, so we should ensure there will be no \ncompressive yielding at design ultimate loads. . . . . \n\nWeight-Designers of flight structures qwckly develop an mstinct for meeting \nrequirements with the lightest structure. Throughout preliminary design, the configu-\nration and loads will change, and we will have to increase the sizes of many structnnll \nelements. We will also find elements that are unnecessari!y hea~, but ~e. w~'t \nalways change the design.

Stress and Strain. Stress is load, P, divided by area, A Strain Is the change In \nlength, tot, dMded by the Initial length, L \n\nWe express it as the modulus of elasticity\" or Young's modulus, E: \n\nE=(1 \ne (11-42) \n\nValues for E were shown in Table 11-52. Metals typically start by exhibiting a \nlinear relationship between stress and strain. Strain in this region is termed elastic \nbecause it will return to zero after the load is removed. \n\nBeyond a stress called the proportional limit (normally assumed to be the same \nvalue in tension and compression), a material's stress/strain curve is no longer linear. \nIn other words, if we design our structure such that its material is stressed above the \nproportional limit, linear methods of analysis would no longer apply. This can be risky \nbecause so many of our methods of analysis are based on the assumption of linearity; \nany other assumption would make loads analysis, in particular, so cumbersome it \nwould be impractical. Inelastic effects influence structural stability more than any-\nthing else. An effective guideline for preliminary design is to keep the design ultimate \ncompressive stress below the material's proportional limit. \n\nAbove the elastic limit, which is often indistinguishable from the proportional limit \nbut can be higher, the material will undergo residual strain (plastic strain), which \nremains after the load is removed. Convention has defined the yield stress to be the \nstress that would cause the material to have a residual strain of 0.2%. Although the \nmaterial actualIy begins to yield at the elastic limit, such initial yielding is often not \nnoticeable in a structural assembly. For design, we commonly use the traditionally \ndefined yield stress, based on the assumption that 0.2% permanent strain would not be \ndetrimental. To design to this value, we need to make sure our structure would still \nfunction properly if it sustained the corresponding permanent deformation. \n\nA material that can yield substantially before rupturing is termed ductile. Ductile \nmaterials can survive local concentrations of strain without failing. resist crack forma-\ntion, and allow parts to be shaped through hammering and bending. Conversely, brittle \nmaterials, such as ceramics, do not deform plastically before rupturing. In designing \nwith brittle materials, we must make sure the local concentration of strain around a \ndiscontinuity, such as a drilled hole, does not cause an elastic stress that exceeds the \n\n\u2022 Elasticity is the characteristic of a material to return to its original dimensions after an applied \nforce is removed. \n\n11.6 Structures and Mecbanisms 473 \n\nrupture stress (ultimate stress).

The distributed lateral load. w(x), \nplaces the beam in a state of bending and shear. We can see evidence of the bending \nfrom the fact that the deformed beam is no longer straight (Fig. 1I-3IB).

The shear reaction, R, at the fixed \nend must be equal and opposite to the sum of w(x) or the beam would no longer be in \nequilibrium. \n\nThe beam's internal shear forces and bending moments can be expressed as func-\ntions of the applied load w(x).

However, from the shape of the deflected beam, we can see that \nthe upper surface of the beam is stretched; this material is in tension. Likewise, the bot-\ntom material is shortened and is in compression. The tensile and compressive stresses \nare necessary to react the applied bending load. The bending moment increases for \nsections of the beam closer to the fixed end. For any individual cross-section of the \nbeam,. the tensile and compressive stresses are maximum at the upper and lower \nsurfaces. Provided the maximum stress remains below the proportional limit,. these \nstresses v~ linearly for parallel surfaces inward from the extremities, finally reaching \nzero at a line called the neutral axis (Fig. 11-31C).

The truss member design \nloads derive from preliminary load factors, the mass distribution, and the vehicle \ngeometIy. All 12 truss members are graphite-epoxy tubes with machined titanium end \nfittings. Four members are 10.2 em in diameter. They were sized as beam-columns to \nwithstand axial loading and bending while partially supporting solar panels during \nlaunch. The ultimate, equivalent axiaI load is 102,300 N. The other eight members are \n8.9 em in diameter and sized for 93,410 N. \n\nThe adapter cone for the Solid Rocket Motor is a honeycomb structure that transfers \nthe motor's thrust loads from 24 equally spaced bolts at the forward end to four large \nbolts that attach to the truss for the IUS at the aft end. The forward equipment module \nconsists of a tubular framework covered with thin shear panels. The frames are welded \n2219 aluminum alloy 5.08-cm2 tubing with wall thicknesses varying from 1.27 to \n3.81 mm. Numerous equipment boxes are attached to the tubes using threaded fasteners \nfor easy ~moval. The shear panels enclose the framework except where an equipment \nbox forms an effective load path. The tube-member sizes result from beam-column \nanalysis, including transient and acoustic loads. \n\n\n\n486 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.6 \n\n11.6.7 An Example Problem \n\nThe following example parallels the process for sizing the spacecraft structme and \nbooster adapter in Table 11-56. Structural size and mass are driven by either strength \nor stiffness requirements. We can begin the process by sizing the structme to meet load \nrequirements and check the resulting natural frequency, or we can begin with a fre-\nquency requirement, size the structme, and check strength. Equations are provided to \ndo either. Most short, heavy spacecraft are strength driven and long, lighter spacecraft \nor assemblies are stiffness driven.

The bending mode requirement is much \nmore critical. For a 0.286-em thickness, the cylinder's cross-sectional area is 180 cm2. \n\nApplied and equivalent Axial Loads \n\nBy multiplying the spacecraft weight by the load factors, we can derive the limit or \nmaximum expected loads. See Table 11-58 for the example cylinder limit loads. \n\nTABLE 11-58. CylInder Applied Loads.The distance Is measured from the base to the cylinder's \ncenter of mass.

Eqs. (11-52) and (11-53)], using \nthe cylinder thickness required for bending stability.

The pressure and load factors must be time-\nconsistent (for example, do not combine lift-off loads with venting pressures that occur \nlater in the ascent). In the case of stability, internal pressure can strengthen a shell. We \ncan increase the reduction factor, y. slightly to account for the stiffening effect of the \ninternal pressure. Lateral shear will tend to lower the buckling load \n\n\n\n490 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.6 \n\nCalculating the Mass \n\nThe mass of the cylinder is the product of the density, p, and volume, 2n R t L. \n\nm = p 2 n R t L = (2.8 x 1(3)(2)(n)(1.0)(O.002 95)(10.0) \n\n=519kg \n(11-72) \n\nAny fasteners, attachments.!... and access doors would increase this mass somewhat, \nmaking allowances for material lost in drilled holes and cut outs. \n\nSummary of Monocoque Options \n\nThe driving requirements for the monocoque cylinder are bending rigidity and \ncompressive stability, which represent actual design conditions. Please note that the \nc~c~ation for first n~ frequency depends on a crude assumption of equally \ndIStributed mass. In this examp.le, we want only to illustrate methods and clarify the \nneed for iterative design. In an actual design, we would know the mass distribution and \nuse computerized techniques to get a more realistic weight for the structure . \n\n. If we break the cylinder into several assemblies, such as an adapter on the bottom \nWl~ a spacecraft bus on top, we co~d analyze each section separately. For cylinder \nsection~ closer to the base, Peq loads mcrease. Thus, we would want to analyze differ-\nent sections for varying types of construction, each with its own applied loads. In this \nex~ple, we could assume that the spacecraft adapter occupies the bottom 2 m of the \ncylinder, resulting in a preliminary mass of 519 x 2110 = 103.8 kg. \n\nOption 2-Skin-8trlnger \n\nS~ppose we stiffen the cylinder with 12 longitudinal members, called stringers, and \n11 crrcumferential rings, or frames. The cylinder's circumference is 6.28 m, so the \n30-deg stringer spacing results in a stringer spacing of 0.5236 m, measured along the \ncurved surface. The frames separate the cylinder into 10 sections. or bays, each with a \nheight of 1.0 m.

StrInger Arrangement and Geometry. \n\n, J , \n\n11.6 Structures and Mechanisms 491 \n\nIt is reasonable to assume that the presence of stiffening stringers and rings in tIlis \ndesign allows us to reduce the skin's thickness. A designer's initial concern with a \nthinner skin is buckling; the concern is real and we will indeed check for this mode of \nfailure. In addition, thin, external surfaces with large surface areas are also susceptible \nto the acoustic environment. Acoustically driven loads are based on many factors, \nincluding: \n\n\u2022 The launch vehicle's acoustic environment \n\n\" Location of the structure within the payload fairing, or shroud \n\n\u2022 Whether acoustic blankets are used to help diminish noise within the shroud \n\n\u2022 Type of structure (as we said, large and thin surfaces are more affected) \n\n\u2022 Whether the structure is an external or internal payload surface \n\n\u2022 Boundary conditions of the surface edges \n\n\u2022 Whether the surface is flat or curved \n\n\u2022 The first resonant frequency of the surface (depends on size, shape, thickness, \nmaterial's modulus of elasticity, and edge boundary conditions). \n\nThe calculations for acoustic loads are cumbersome; see Sec. 7.7 of Sarafin [1995] \nfor an example of one technique. We will assume a starting standard gage skin thick-\nness of 0.127 em is adequate against acoustic noise for our design. \n\nFirst, we must choose whether to design the skin to help sustain load or whether to \nallow it to buckle, forcing the stiffeners to take on more of the burden. In this example, \nwe will design the skin not to buckle, as is usually done when performing preliminary \nsizing analysis. Chapter ell of Bruhn [1973] provides details on how to analyze \nbuckled skin. \n\nStiffness \n\nAgain, let's first size.for stiffness. We already know from calculations for OptioD 1 \nthat we need a skin thickness of 0.045 em to meet the axial frequency requirement of \n25 Hz. Therefore, the 0.127-cm-thick skin alone will be adequate for axial rigidity. In \nthe bending case, the required area moment of inertia, I, of the cylinder's cross-section \nis 8.98 x 105 cm4. The skin will satisfy part of this: \n\nIskin = n R3 t = n(1.0)3(0.001 27) = 4.00 x lOS cm4 (11-73) \nTherefore, the contribution to I from the 12 stringers must equal the remainder. \n\nIstr= 8.98 x lOS -4.00 x lOS =4.98 x lOS em4 (11-74) \nWe can calculate the I of the 12 stringers in the cylinder using the parallel axis tbe-\n\n. orem, Ixx = 1: (Iem + Atf2). We can ignore the lem' or I about each stringer's center of \nmass, because it will be very small compared to its Ad2 term. Therefore, the I of the \nstringer system is a function of stringer cross-sectional area, A, and d, the distance \nfrom the cylinder's neutral axis (Table 11-60). \n\nTherefore, Istr = 4.98 x lOS cm4 = A x 60,000 cm2. This results in a required cross-\nsectional ,area of each stringer of 8.32 cm2\u2022 The cylinder area combines the s~ and \ntwelve stringers for a total area of 180.00 em2\u2022 Note that both the skin and stringers \nmust contribute to overall I to meet this requirement. When we allow skin to buckle, \n\n1 \n\n\n\n, \n! \n\n492 Spacecraft Subsystems \n1l.6 \n\nTABLE 11-60.

The buckling load. PeT = O\"eT X area = \n(21.2 x 1()6) (0.0180 m2) = 381,000 N. The resulting margin of safety, MS, is \n\nMS= 381,000 -1=-0.57 \n894,000 (11-76) \n\nThe negative margin of safety points out the inadequacy of the design, so we must \nadd thickness to keep the panel from bUCkling, resulting in the values shown in \nTable 11-61. When we increase the thickness like this to prevent panel buckling, we \ncan decrease the area of the stringers, with the goal of achieving the same total area \nand moment of inertia needed for bending stiffness. With a skin thickness of 0.195 cm, \nthis means the required stringer area is 4.78 cm2. \n\nTable 11-61 summarizes the estimation of mass for the skin-stringer option. using \na mass density of 2.800 kglm3\u2022 Note we've included an extra 25% to account for ring \nframes. which are needed to stabilize the stringers and fasteners; this is simply an \nestimate. Note also that. in a real sizing exercise such as this. we would need to con-\nfirm the feasibility of only 4.78 cm2 area for each stringer. To keep a stringer from \nbuckling as a column between ring frames. we need to design its cross section to have \na relatively large moment of inertia. A common strategy for doing this at low mass is \nto use a thin-walled 1- or C-section. However. we might find that. to provide the \nneeded area moment of inertia with an area of 4.78 cm2\u2022 we would need to make the \nflanges and webs so thin that they could not carry the design load without buckling \nloca1Iy. Chapter 8 of Sarafin [1995J explains how to assess column buckling and local \nbuckling for thin-walled structural members. \n\n11.6 Structures and Mechanisms 493 \n\nTABLE 11-1i1.

The \nformer, such as antenna gimbals or solar array drives, require frequent or constant \narticulation. The latter restrain a payload on launch or retrieval, or they propel the \npayload to the deployed or restored position. Figures 11-46 and 11-47 show examples \nof these mechanisms. The design is complete only when principles of mechanics and \nenvironmental considerations lead to a producible and testable spacecraft. The most \nchallenging requirements for mechanisms are those that demand precision pointing \nand a long operating life. \n\nFIg. 11-46.

Low-cycJlc Mechanism, Solar Array Retention Mechanism. An example of an \naerospace appendage retention mechanism. \n\nThe MIL-A-83577 [1988] specification for moving mechanical assemblies gives us \nimportant technical guidance. The functional requirements for the mechanisms derive \nfrom mission requirements and resolve into torques or forces and operating rates. An \noperating rate profile, as shown in Fig. 11-48, establishes the payload articulation or \ndeployment rate. This profile determines the maximum angular acceleration, a. Once \nwe have determined the payload moment of inertia, MOl, we can compile the mecha-\nnism's operating torque, T = a (MOl). For rough torque sizing, we can add a 20% \nfriction torque to the operating torque. The constant-speed part (sz) of the operating \nrate profile, represents the mechanism operating torque because there is no accel-\neration during this phase. With the two operating points known, we can generate a \ntorque-speed curve (see Fig. 11-49). This linear curve establishes the stall torque and \ntheoretical no-load speed for the mechanism. When these mechanism-performance \ncharacteristics are arithmetically manipulated by the mechanical advantage of a gear \ntrain, the new performance characteristics represent the principal motor requirements. \nWith the mechanism's stall torque now known, we can do first-order approximations \nof the mechanism parameters using Fig. 11-50. \n\nAs an example, a solar array with moment of inertia, MOl, must be deployed by \nrotating from a stowed position to a locked position in time, t. This time period involves \naccelerating the array to a maximum rate, sl' then decelerating to the lock. Therefore, \nthe operating torque (operating point 1) equals moment of inertia, MOl, times acceler-\nation (sl +t/2). In the absence of other running friction data, we can assume operating \npoint 2 is 20% of operating point 1. Extrapolating to a stall torque (assume 200 N-m) \nlets us use Fig. 11-50. If the mechanism had a 200 N'm stall torque, we can see thirt the \nmechanism mass will be about 18 kg, require 90 W of power, and have a volume of \nabout 7,800 em3\u2022 As a guideline, mechanisms should have a 100% torque margin to \nprovide for uncertainties of friction, payload inertia growth, and thermal effects. \n\n\n\n496 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.6 \n\nTorque\" \nO Deceleration \n~------~~~~~ tI2 \n\nO~ ____ ~ ____ ~ ____ ~ \n\n\"Resulting from constant current applied \nto motor. \n\n\"Resulting from constant current applied \nto motor. \n\nFig. 11-48.

The mechanism \ndesign should be robust to withstand stall torques and to maintain its structural \nstiffness over a wide range of temperatures. The mechanism is not a major power con-\nsumer. Low-cyclic mechanisms operate only a few times in the mission. High-cyclic \nmechanisms draw high currents during the acceleration phase of the duty cycle, a \nphase that is generally 10% of its operating life. Volume constraints will dictate the \ndesign process. Also, requirements for mechanical and electrical interfaces will in-\nfluence the mechanism's volume and structure. The mechanism will also produce its \nown requirements for torques or forces, operating rates, structural stiffness, operating \nlife and histogram (torque/cycle matrix), and environments. The mechanism muSt \nwithstand the launch and derived vibration tests, which will influence the strength and \nstiffness requirements. The mechanism must operate in orbit. where the thermal-\nvacuum environment will influence the selection of materials, lubricants, and coat-\nings.1t will also create thermally induced loads caused by difference in coefficients of \nthermal expansion of selected structural materials. \n\nFor more information on space mechanisms, see Conley [1998], Sarafin [1995], \nand MiI-A-83577 [1988], \n\n11.7 Guidance and Navigation \n\nJames R. Wertz, Microcosm, Inc. \n\nWe use navigation\" and orbit determination interchangeably to mean determining \nthe satellite's position and velocity or, equivalently, its orbital elements as a function \nof time. Similarly, we use both guidance and orbit control to mean adjusting the orbit \nto meet some predetermined conditions. For satellites, orbit control has two important \nsubsets. Orbit maintenance refers to maintaining the orbital elements but not the tim-\ning of when the satellite is at a particular location in the orbit. Stationkeeping refers to \nmaintaining the satellite within a predefined box, which includes maintaining both the \nin-track position and the other orbital elements. Altitude maintenance is an example of \norbit maintenance in which occasional thruster firings are used to overcome drag and \nkeep the orbit from spiraling downward. Geosynchronous stationkeeping maintains \nthe satellite in a box over one place on the Earth. Stationkeeping in low-Earth orbit \nincludes constellation maintenance, in which each satellite is maintained in a moving \nbox defined relative to the rest of the satellites in the constellation. \n\nThe satellite ephemeris is a tabular listing of the position and possibly the velocity \nas 11 function of time, usually in electronic form. It is important to distinguish the \nsatellite ephemeris from the solar ephemeris, which lists the relative positions of the \n\n\u2022 The origin of the terminology causes some confusion, particularly when reading older sources \nor references not associated with satellites. Navigation traditionally refeaed to determining \nhow to get a craft where we wanted it to go. The term guidaru;e was introduced with rockets \nand missiles to mean computing the steering commands needed to make the rocket go where \nwe wanted it to (thus, a guided missile); control meant carrying out these steering commands \nto adjust the vehicle's direction of flight Thus, an intercept missile would have a guidance \nand control (G&C) system, and a space plane or interplanetmy spacecraft would have a guid-\nance, navigation. and control (GN&C) system. However, for spacecraft we use navigation to \nmean orbit detenilination, guidance to mean orbit control, and control system as a shortened \nform of attitude control system. \n\n\n\n498 Spacecraft Subsystems lL7 \n\nEarth and Sun as the Earth travels in its orbit, and lunar and planetary ephemerides \nwhich provide similar data for other bodies in the solar system. . ' \n\nThere are two types of orbit determination, differentiated by timing. Real-time orbit \ndetermination provides the best estimate of where a satellite is at the present time and \nmay be important for spacecraft and payload operations, such as accurate pointing at \nsome target DefoUtive orbit determination is the best estimate of the satellite position \nand orbital elements at some earlier time. It is done after gathering and processing all \nrelevant observations. Orbit propagation refers to integrating the equations of motion \nto determine where a satellite will be at some other time. Usually orbit propagation \nrefers to looking ahead in time from when the data was taken and is used either for \nplanning or operations. Occasionally orbits will be propagated backward in time, \neither to determine where a satellite was in the past or to look at historical astronomical \nobservations in the case of comets or planets. \n\nTraditionally, ground stations from around the world pmvide tracking data to a \nmission-operations center. When all data is available, definitive orbit determination \nprovides the best estimate of the orbit This is used to process the payload data for \nscience or observation missions. The best estimate of the orbit is then propagated \nforward for real-time operations (such as star cata10g selection or maneuver timing) \nand further forward for mission planning. \n\nIn 1983 NASA launched the first Tracking omJ Data Relay Satellite, TDRS, to \nbegin replacing the worldwide ground tracking network.\" IDRS provides the same \nfunctions as the traditional ground-station network. As the name implies, it tracks low-\nEarth orbiting satellites and relays data between the satellite and the IDRS ground \nstation in White Sands, NM. As described in Sec. 11.72, GPS, GLONASS, and other \nmore autonomous systems are also becoming operational, so orbit determination for \nfuture systems will differ significantly from what it has been in the past. \n\nWe can think of orbit determination and control as analogous to attitude determi-\nnation and control. The ADCS subsystem (Sec. 11.1) measures and maintains the \nspacecraft's orientation about its center of mass. Similarly, the guidance and naviga-\ntion function, perhaps better thought of as the Orbit Determination omJ Control \nSubsystem, or OOCS, measures and maintains the position of the spacecraft's center \nof mass. Both systems deal with spacecraft dynamics and both have the multiple func-\ntions of acquisition, determination, maintenance, and maneuver control. \n\n11.7.1 System Definition Process \n\nMajor changes are occurring in the guidance and navigation arena. Traditionally, \nthis has been exclusively a ground-operations activity. However, with the introduction \nof GPS and advanced onboard computers, several options now exist for autonomous \nnavigation-determining the orbit on board the satellite in real time. We also have the \ncapability to perform autonomous orbit maintenance and control, so the orbit determi-\nnation and control function will change significantly. Even if we ultimately choose a \ncompletely traditional approach, we should evaluate new techniques which may \nreduce cost and risk for a particular space mission. \n\nTable 11-64 summarizes the process of derming the orbit determination and control \nfunction. Each of the steps is descnDed below.

Define top-levelfunctions. We want to determine the key mission objec-\ntives which require either navigation information or orbit maintenance and control. \nTypically, we think of maintaining the satellite in a specialized .orbit ~ver the 1if~ of \nthe mission. Examples include a geostationary sl~t, Lagran.ge J?OlDl orbIt,. or ~g, \nground track orbit. We may also need stationkeeplDg to mamtam the relative POSItions \n\n\" \n\n\n\n500 Spaceeraft Subsystems 11.7 \n\nbetween spacecraft in a constellation. Orbit control, but not orbit maintenance, is \nneeded to reach a particular destination such as rendezvous with another spacecraft, \nlanding on the Moon, or insertion into a particular geosynchronous slot. \n\nNavigation has two basic pmposes. It allows us to maintain and control the orbit, \njust as attitude determination is used for attitude control. Thus, any requirement for \norbit control will ordinarily result in a corresponding requirement for navigation. We \nmay also need navigation information to process data from the payload. Although \nsome science missions may actuallY,use position data (e.g., mapping of the magnetic \nfield or particle flux density), it is usually only part of payload pointing and mapping. \nIrrespective of any orbit control, we often need to point an antenna or instrument at \nsome location or to define where an instrument is looking on the surface of the Earth. \nTypically, this results in a more stringent navigation requirement than for purely \noperational pmposes. \n\nStep 2. Do pointing and mapping trades. Because these are typically the most \nstringent requirements, we must do the pointing and mapping trades described in \nSec. 5.4 to obtain a preliminary estimate of the needed accuracy. In most cases, the \npointing and mapping requirement can be met by trading between navigation and atti-\ntude accuracy (see Fig. 4-6), so navigation trades will frequently need to be perfonned \nin conjunction with attitude trades. \n\nStep 3. Determine need for orbit control. At the system level, we must decide \nwhether we need to maintain or control the orbit. If we don't, we may be able to save \nmoney and weight by eliminating the propulsion subsystem. But if we need a propul-\nsion system anyway, this hardware can often easily handle orbit maintenance and \ncontrol. At the same time, maintaining the orbit may significantly extend the mission \nlife and thereby reduce the cost per year. \n\nStep 4. Do autonomous orbit control trade. If we must control the orbit, then we \nneed to determine whether to do so from the ground or autonomously on board the \nspacecraft. Traditionally, the ground station has controlled the orbit. In most cases, this \nremains the best approach if the orbit control activity is nonrecurring and com-\nmunications with the satellite are straightforward, as in the case of transfer to \ngeosynchronous orbit. Here, orbit control needs are well defined, traditional ground \ntechniques are available, and it is needed only once during the mission. Thus, an \nautonomous, onboard system would probably cost more than we would save from \nlower operations expenses. However, autonomous orbit maintenance and control can \nreduce life-cycle cost and risk for many missions (see Sec. 11.7.3). Over the next \ndecade, I expect it to become as common as autonomous attitude control is on today's \nspacecraft. \n\nStep S. Determine where navigation data is needed. Section 2.1.1 describes how \nto do a data flow analysis to detennine where data comes from and where it is needed. \nIf we choose not to design the system to minimize communications and data flow, our \ndecision must be justifiable. For example, we may choose to avoid the nonrecurring \ncost of putting the processing where it would be most efficient. An extreme would be \na small LightSat with a single ground station which performs all of the data evaluation, \nsystem control, and mission planning. In this case, it is probably easiest to do the \nnavigation on a small computer at the ground station. At the other extreme would be a \nsatellite communicating with many distributed users, each of whom needs to know \neither the satellite position or derivative information such as the ground look-point \nlocation. In this case, the navigation data is probably needed on board the spacecraft, \nalthough we could navigate from the ground and uplink the results. The third possible \n\n11.7 Guidance and Navigation 501 ' \n\nf navigation data is by the spacecraft itself for payload functions such as pointing \nuse; et selection and for real-time identification. We can also use navigation data for \nor c!rart control functions such as orbit maintenance, star catal~g selection, ~r d~ter\u00ad\n~ \u00b7ng where the Sun is relative to the spacecraft for accurate attitude detemunati~n. \nlD1~tep 6. Do autonomous vs. ground-based ~vigation trad~. ~e ~ust determ.me \nwhether reducing the long-term, recurring operations cost and n~k J~stifies .the co~t of \nautonomous navigation. Tradition strongly supports ground naVIgation. ThIS proV1~es \na greater level of comfort to some customers and end users wh.o are conc~ed. pnm-\narily that there be no deviation from prior ~oced~es. Irrespectiv~ ?f techD1c~ ISSUes, \nthere is a level of programmatic risk asSOCIated WIth any nontraditional solution. The \n. ue of autonomous navigation clearly falls in this area, although semi-autonomous \nISS \u2022 \u2022. \nnavigation, such as TDRS and GPS, IS gatD1~g accep!an~e. . \n\nA key question is whether we need real-~me na~g~tIon data, eIther on ~d the \nsatellite or for the end user. If we must prOVIde naVIgation and payl~ad data sImulta-\neously autonomous navigation is highly desirable. The alternative would be to \n\n~avigat~ on the ground and uplink the solution~ for use by th~ sp.acecra~ .or to send \nthem to the end user. This approach makes relIable commuDlcations cntical. If ~e \n\nork is done on the ground, then there are two possibilities. It can be done either m ':aI time using real-time data from the spacecraft, or it can be done using older data \n~bich is 'propagated forward to produce a real~time ephemeris. In the past we used \nolder data because real-time data was not avaIlable. TDRS, G~S, GLONA~S, and \nvarious autonomous navigation systems now allow us to use real-time data whIch does \nnot need to be as accurate as data for propagated solutions.. . \n\nStep 7. Select a navigation meth~d. Section 11.7.2 ~ummanzes the alternatIve \nspacecraft navigation methods and therr ad~antages and dI~dv.antages. \n\nStep 8. Define requirements for the guidance ~nd navIgation-system. W. e .should \ndefine the top-level requirements in tenns of wh~t IS needed r~ther ~an ho.w ~t IS to be \ndone. Thus, requirements should be expressed m tenns of mappmg, . pomtin~, c?n-\nstellation maintenance, and level of autonomy rather than the specIfic navIga~on \nmethod to be used. While we will go through detailed trades to select the best navIg~\u00ad\ntion method we should focus on mission objectives to define requirements. ThIS \nallows later ~ades which may either be more detailed or use new information. \n\n11.7.2 Orbit Determination Systems \n\nThere are three elements to the orbit detennination problem: (I) the source and ~ \nof data, (2) the algorithms for modeling the orbi~, and (3) the computer progr~ whIch \nprocesses the observations. The second and thrrd elements are w~ll establIshed and \nwill be described only briefly here. I will concentrate on the alternatIve sources of data \nand the advantages and disadvantages of each in an orbit detennination system. \n\nThe analytical methods for orbit detenninati~n are co~plex ~u~ well understood. \nThey are summarized briefly in Chap. 6 and dISCUSsed m detaIl m several modern \nreference works. Vallado [2001], Battin [1999], Chobotov [1991], Escobal [19~5], \nNoton [1998], and Roy [1991] provide extensive discussions of orbit detennination \nand orbit propagation methods. .... . \n\nGenerally the various algorithms used for orbIt determmation are Implemented m \na small number of large and complex software systems. The major orbit detennin.ation \nsystems are used for multiple space programs. Perhaps the most frequently used IS the \nGoddard Trajectory Determination System, GTDS, used by NASA to process data for \nnearly all low-Earth orbit satellites [Long et a1.,1989]. NORAD and others use a \n\n\n\n502 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7 \n\nsimilar system for tracking spacecraft based on radar observations JPL's D S \nNetwork (DSN) uses a uniq~e and remarkably accurate system to ~k int~ian~:; \nspa~ [Jordan, 1981; Miller et al., 1990). It solves simultaneously for the orbits of \nth~ l~terplane~ probes and the planets and satellites which they approach. For many \n~on ~alYSIS purposes, Chap. 6 (or any book on astrodynamics) contains sufficient \ntnformation to constru~t an elementary orbit propagator. Highly precise orbit propaga-\ntors are now commerctally available. \n\nThe ob~ations used for orbit determination can be obtained by tracking from the \nground, tracking from space, or from autonomous or semi-autonomous systems on the \nsp~ Each of these approaches is described below. Table 11-65 summarizes \nthetr relative advantages and disadvantages. \n\nTABLE 11-65. Advantages and Disadvantages of Alternative Navigation Methods.

We either track the \n\nspacecraft's telemetry signals or use radar tracking from a site not associated with the \nspacecraft. In both cases, the principal data used for orbit determination are range and \nrange rate-that is, the distance from the ground station to. the satellite and the \nsatellite's line-of-sight velocity during the overhead pass. Angular measurements are \nalso available at times but are typically far less accurate than range or range-rate \n\nmeasurements. \nAccurate orbit determination using ground-station data ordinarily requires a \n\nnumber of passes. We may accumulate data from multiple passes over a single ground \nstation, or may receive data at a central location from multiple ground stations around \nthe world. In either case, data from a number of passes goes to one place for processing \nthrough a large system such as GTDS, described above. Ground-based systems neces-\nsarily operate on historical data and therefore will use propagated orbits for real-time \noperations and mission planning. Accuracies achievable with ground-based tracking \nvary with a spacecraft's orbit and the accuracy and amount of data. However, 3a \naccuracies typically range from several kilometers for low-Earth orbits to approxi-\nmately 50 km for geosynchronous orbit. \n\nTDRS \nThe Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS, has now replaced NASA's world':' \n\nwide ground-tracking network. A major advantage of this system is that the two \noperational TDRS satellites can provide tracking data coverage for 85% to 100% of \nmost low-Earth orbits. (TDRS does not work for satellites in geosynchronous orbit.) \nThe system collects mostly range and range-rate data from the TDRS satellite to the \nsatellite being tracked. Angular information is available, but is much less accurate than \nthe range and range-rate data. If atmospheric drag effects on a satellite are small, \nTDRS can achieve 30 accuracies of about 50 m. This is considerably better than most \nground-tracking systems. Another way to track from space is to use satellite-to-\nsatellite or crosslink tracking as described below. \n\nSpacecraft Autonomous Navigation \nAs summarized in Table 11-66, manufacturers have developed a number of auton-\n\nomous navigation systems for spacecraft. Determining the orbit on board is technically \neasy with the advent of advanced spacecraft computers and higher-order languages. \nThe principal problem is to provide orbit determination that is reliable, robust. and \neconomical in terms of both cost and weight. A number of systems which can do this \nnow exist-autonomous orbit determination is clearly feasible but becoming less \nimportant with the increasing use of GPS for navigation in low-Earth orbit. Wertz \n[2001] and Chory et ru. [1986) describe alternative methods of autonomous navigation\" \non board satellites. Table 11-65, earlier in the section, gives the advantages and disad-\nvantages of the primary alternatives. \n\nAutonomous navigation is inherently real-time. Thus, definitive orbit solutions and \npayload data are available simultaneously, which means that we can generate ground \nlook-points or target positions and immediately associate them with the payload data. \nIn addition, measurements can be less accurate than those for systetns that work on old \ndata, because solutions propagated forward in time lose accuracy. For example, to do \naccurate orbit maneuvers without autonomous navigation, we need a greater accuracy \nfrom a definitive solution based on old data that must be propagated forward to meet \n\n\n\n504 \n\n.... .... \n\n.. \nIi! \n:I \nti \n~ c \nII \n\n== \n\n~ Q) \nE \n\nS \n\n01 \n\n~& \nI!c \nU! \n0 \n\n1) \nC'J \n\nij'~ \nD.I! \n~:I \n\n~ \nI c \n~ \nS \n! \n\n(I) \n:I a \n\n~ \nID \n\nE \n\n1 \n\nI \nII: \n\n.!i \ne \n~ \n~ \n\n0 :::J \n0 \nE \n0 C \n~ \naI \n..!.. \nE Q) \nen \n\n~ c \n0 \n\n~ \nE \n8 \n.... 0 \n~w 1t)..J \n.... .5 \n\n11:: \n\u20ac \n0 \n\na; \nc \n0 \n\n! \n8. \n0 \n\nC \n0 \n\nI \nl \na \n~:l o:t:! \n!'ill \n~i \n\n9l' a:: g>0 \n~ ..... \n\n!~j \n~~~ \n(!lilt/) \n\ni \n~ \n\noS! \n~ \n\n.: \n0 \n\n0:!!Q) ... ~ = i) \n~~Sa \nO~(I).5 = ~ li2 ~ \n:I.5~'iij' \ni \u00a7:J:::J o~ ... ~~ \n\n\"O~ \n\n2 if! \ng@ ~ i~ ..JC!l:::J'Q.o \nEOI \n8~ -\nr:'\u20ac\"O \ng~ic \n\no..J~\u00a78 \n~c\u00a7en~ \n\n~ \n\n8 c \n0;; ~ \u00a7 \n\n::j\u00a7~:g \n\u20ac e8.~ 011101 \"0 \n\n.5 \n\ni \nS \n.Et') \n~m u. .... \n\ni \n'Oc \n08 \n\u00a7~ \n\nii \nIB -.a c \n061 \n\n!II \n\nE5 a \n\u00a7~lllE~ \ne o~!<: \n~~~ ~ \n\nSpacecraft Subsystems \n\nc :e \naI \n~ \n\"0 \ni \n\n~ \n= iii :::J\"O \n\n>.~ Q) GiS \nlD 11 Q) \"0 'Q.>, \n\nti ~0E gil ... ;::. as.e C liS \"Cc \n~ll= ~~ \n\nD.o \n.5a \n\n!~~ \n... \n\n:li~ :s!i \n-alQ) :::Jc 8~i ~E= 8= \n\n~ ~ \n\n2 ! a; D. \n00 go go WW \"CW \"CW ..JC!l Q...J Q...J \n\n~ e \n~ \n\n-Q) \nE 1!!1D \n0 0 ~E CDoE It) It) \nC\\I .... en:;;: \n\n\"0 \"0 \"0 c CD \n\n=1 i\nCD 111\"0 :t:!:::J :t:!\"g \n\n\u20ac- \u20ac \u20aci!!

With real-time systems, highly accurate orbit propagation is less \ncritical, although we will still need some forward propagation for prediction and \n\nplanning. \n\nGPS and GLONASS \nThe Global Positioning System, also called GPS or Navstar, is a system of \n\nnavigation satellites funded by the U.S. Department of Defense and intended explicitly \nto allow position determination by very small receivers anywhere on or near the \nEarth's surface. Extensive discussions of GPS and its applications, including signal \nstructure and processing algorithms, are provided by Parkinson and Spilker [1996], \nLeick [1995], Kaplan [1996], and Hofmann-Wellenhof[1997]. GPS receivers are now \nreadily available and their use is becoming widespread in airplanes, ships, ground \nvehicles, and military equipment. The system provides a moderate accuracy signal \n(50 m-l00 m) for general navigation and a high-accuracy coded signal (15 m) for \nmilitary applications. Commercial GPS receivers are now available for spacecraft; and \nare gaining in popularity in low-Earth orbit [Wertz, 2001; Chory et aI., 1986; Anthony, \n1992; Parkinson and Gilbert, 1983; Porter and Hite, 1984]. \n\nGPS receivers use signals from four different GPS satellites to solve simulta-\nneously for the three components of the observer's position and the time. This can be \ndone several times, providing position and velocity data which determines the orbit \nelements. The GPS constellation is in a 12 hour orbit at approximately half-\ngeosynchronous altitude. Because the GPS antennas are designed to provide signals \nonly in a cone covering the Earth's surface, coverage drops off rapidly with altitude, \neven for satellites in low-Earth orbit [Wertz, 1999]. Nonetheless, both analytic and \nexperimental studies have been done on using GPS for navigation in orbits as high as \ngeosynchronous using the spillover of the beam beyond the edge of the Earth\u00b7 s disk \n[Chao, et al., 1992]. \n\nThe GPS signal can also be used to solve for the attitude of the vehicle on which \nthe receiver is located. This is done by using multiple GPS antennas which are a \nknown distance apart and which are attached to a rigid element of the vehicle. By mea-\nsuring the phase difference between the signal from one GPS satellite arriving at two \nantennas, the GPS receiver serves as an interferometer measuring the angle between \nthe line of sight to the GPS satellite and the line joining the two antennas. The \nwavelength of the GPS carrier signal is about 20 cm. Therefore, the accuracy of the \nattitude is limited by both the long wavelength and multi-path effects which cause con-\nfusion in the identification of the signal coming directly from the GPS satellite. In \npractice, spacecraft have been able to achieve on-orbit attitude accuracies on the order \nof 0.3 to 0.5 deg. \n\nA number of practical difficulties have prevented GPS receivers from developing \nsubstantial operational utility in space for attitude determination. One problem is that \nmulti-path effects can cause difficulties in some geometries and the GPS constellation, \nby nature, will eventually present most geometrical circumstances to the spacecraft. \nOrbit determination is an activity which can be done intermittently without harming \nsystem performance, but attitude determination must be continuous if-we are to avoid \na major failure. Consequently, the potential lack of availability of four GPS satellites \nfor even a short period due to either geometrical circumstances or the outage of one or \nmore satellites is a major concern for a spacecraft which depends on GPS for attitude \ndetermination. Thus, GPS-based attitude sensors will probably serve principally as \nbackup, or would require backup systems to prevent major anomalies. \n\n\n\n506 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7 \n\nThe global navigation satellite system, GWNASS, is a Russian space-based \nnavigation system that provides 3-D position, velocity determination and time dis-\nsemination on a worldwide basis. GLONASS is very similar to GPS. It consists of a \n24 satellite constellation at approximately half geosynchronous altitude and provides \naccuracies very similar to those of GPS. There are a number of mannfactmers of \nGLONASS receivers, some of which are combined GPS/GLONASS receivers. \n\nGLONASS is operated by Russia's Ministry of Defense. Like GPS, it was initiated \nin the mid-l9708 with military design goals. Also like GPS, the civilian applications \nbecame apparent rapidly and the system is now in use for both civilian and military \npurposes. While the end results are very similar, the GLONASS signal structure is \nsignificantly different than that of GPS. Both GLONASS and GPS are available for \nuse by spacecraft, and many satellite mannfactmers are considering the use of either \nor both systems for onboard determination of position, velocity, time, and sometimes \nattitude. For further information on GLONASS, see, for example, Leick [1995] and \nKaplan [1996]. \n\nSpace Sextant \nThe Space Sextant was developed and flight tested in the late 19708 as a means of \n\nautonomous navigation by accurately measuring the angle between a star and the limb \nof the Moon [Martin Marietta Aerospace, 1977; Booker, 1978]. The Space Sextant \nprovides both orbit and attitude information and can work over a very large regime, \nincluding geosynchronous oroit. The Space Sextant unit has been flight qualified; \nhowever, the need for precise telescope measurements makes the instrument rather \nheavy and therefore limits its usefulness in many space applications. \n\nMicrocosm Autonomous Navigation System \nThe Microcosm Autonomous Navigation System (MANS) uses observations of the \n\nEarth. Sun, and Moon from a single sensor to provide real-time position and attitude \ndata rrai and Noerdlinger, 1989; Anthony, 1992]. These objects were chosen princi-\npally because they can be unambiguously identified with high reliability and low cost \nand observations can be done with minor modifications to attitude sensors already on \nmost spacecraft. The MANS flight software can also make use of, but does not require, \ndata from a GPS receiver, star sensors, gyros, and accelerometers. The addition of \nother data sources provides added accuracy but is not required by the system. In addi-\ntion to orbit and attitude, MANS provides ground look point and Sun direction \ninformation (even when the Sun is not visible to the sensor). It can work at any attitude \nand any orbit from LEO to beyond GEO. MANS was flight tested on the TAOS \nmission launched in 1994 [Hosken and Wertz, 1995]. \n\nStellar-Horizon Systems \nA number of approaches for omit and attitude determination have been proposed, \n\nbased on the interaction of starlight with the Earth's atmosphere [Hummel, 1984]. \nSpecifically, as stars approach the edge of the Earth as seen from the spacecraft, \nrefraction will cause their position relative to other stars to shift, producing an effect \nwhich can be measured with considerable accuracy. Theoretical accuracies for such \nsystems are projected to be in the vicinity of 100m. However, none of these systems \nhas been fully developed for flight as yet. \n\nSatellite Crosslinks \nA number of proposals have been made for using satellite crosslinks to provide \n\norbit determination [Chory et al., 1984]. This is of interest because it can be done with \n\n11.7 Guidance and Navigation \n507 \n\ncrosslink equipment used for intersatellite communication, and, therefore, requires \nminimal additional hardware. Crosslink tracking has been proposed fo~ a number of \nconstellations, but tends not to be implemen~ beca~ of several practi<:al prob~~s. \nOne problem is .that satellite-t~satellit~ tracking ~vldes only the rel~ve POSitiOns \nof the satellites m the constellatton. Th1S means that If ~e absolute pOS1~?n IS needed \nfor any purpose such as mission planning or data reductton, then an addlbonal system \nmust be provided to establish the oroit relative to the ~'s surface .. A ~nd \nproblem. is that the satellites become interdependent, so satelbte-t~satelbte tracI?ng \nmay not work well for the first satellites or may d~grade if a ~telhte ~to~ worl~ing. \nTherefore, an alternative system not based on sat~llite-to-satelhte tracking IS req~. \nIf additional systems must be provided, there IS less benefit from the satelbte-to-\nsatellite tracking. \n\nLandmark Tracking \nLandmark tracking has also been proposed for orbit determination [Markl~y, \n\n1981]. This has been established as feasible by using data returned .from ~!bte \npayloads. However, it has not been ~ as a norm~ method tor sat<:lbte ?aV1~atJon, \ndue in part to the difficulty of estabIishmg automattc, un.am~lguo~s Idenbficabon of \nlandmarks to ensure that tracking accuracy can be mamtained m the presence of \nadverse weather or poor seeing conditions. \n\nEarth and Star Sensing \nThe combination of Earth and star sensing works similarly to sensing the Earth. \n\nSun and Moon [Wertz, 2001]. The direction and distance to the Earth are se~ \nrelative to the inertial frame of the fixed stars. This is then used to directly determme \nthe direction and distance to the spacecraft. The Earth and stars are available nearly \ncontinuously in imy Earth orbit and star identification is becoming less of a problem \nwith the introduction of substantially better computers for space use. \n\n1l.7.3 Orbit Maintenance and Control \nChapter 6 presented relevant A V equations for orbit mainte~ance and ~ntrol. This \n\nsection discusses when orbit control is necessary and what opbons are available to do \nit. Section 2.1.2 discusses autonomous orbit maintenance as part of a fully autonomous \nspacecraft. . \n\nMost small spacecraft do not require orbit control and have no onboard propulSIOn. \nThis has the advantage of eliminating one spacecraft subsystem and, therefore, reduc-\ning the spacecraft's cost, weight, and complexity. However, once the spacecraft ~as \nseparated from the launch vehicle or upper. stage, no further a;>ntrol of. the satellite \norbit is possible and the satellite will be .subJ~t to dra.g and orM d~a~ m low-Earth \norbit and to cumulative secular perturbabons m all orbits. Usually, thiS IS only accept-\nable for satellites that will last from 1 to 3 years but may be suitable for longer periods \nin some cases. For example, the Voyager spacecraft, having left the solar system, will \nbe uncontrolled indefinitely. The only real objective, however, is to maintain commu-\nnications and, to some degree, sample the interstellar medium. . \n\nWe can also adjust a spacecraft's orbit using other means than onbo~ propulsion, \nsuch as the Orbiter or an orbit-transfer vehicle or tug. For example, With the Space \nTelescope, the Orbiter is used for both instrument replacement and to return the \nTelescope to a higher altitude. \n\n\n\n508 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7 \n\nOrbit control is needed when any of the following are required: \n\n\u2022 Targeting to achieve an end orbit or position-as in satellite rendezvous or \ninterplanetary missions \n\n\u2022 To overcome secular orbit perturbations-such as altitude maintenance in \nlow-Earth orbit or geosynchronous stationkeeping \n\n\u2022 To maintain relative orientations-as in constellation maintenance \n\nEach of these is discussed briefly below. An orbit lifetime of more than 1 to 3 years \nusually demands some type of orbit maintenance or control. \n\nTargeting to achieve a particular orbit or location in space is the most common \nreason for orbit control. Typically, we achieve the orbit objectives with one or two \nlarge maneuvers, using several small maneuvers in between or for final adjustments. \nFor example, in transfer to geosynchronous orbit, an initial large maneuver occurs at \nperigee in low-Earth orbit A second large maneuver follows at apogee near geosyn-\nchronous altitude. Fmally, several small orbit maneuvers over an extended period \nplace the satellite in its final position. This has been traditionally been done by using \nlarge, high-thrust engines for the major maneuvers and smaller engines for orbit \nadjustments. However, as described in more detail in Sec. 7.5, low-thrust engines can \noften be used efficiently for large !:J. Vs. This normally means smaller, lighter, less-\nexpensive engines and much smaller, simpler control systems. Propulsive maneuvers \nusually are the largest attitude disturbance on the spacecraft and, therefore, affect the \nsize of the required attitude control system. Small thrusters can reduce the weight, \ncomplexity, and cost of other components as well as the propulsion system itself. \n\nWe often associate major orbit changes with the early phases of a mission, but they \ncan occur throughout the life of the spacecraft. For example, most geosynchronous \nspacecraft can be shifted so that the longitude of the spacecraft is adjusted to meet \nchanging needs. Spacecraft can also be retargeted to achieve new objectives, such as \nthe retargeting of the ISEE-C spacecraft to rendezvous with Cornet Giacobini-Zinner \nin 1985. The need for maneuvers of this type may arise after the spacecraft has been \nlaunched. They are not planned in advance but simply take advantage of existing \nresources. Finally, as described in Sec. 21.2, it is becoming more critical to use an end-\nof-life maneuver for spacecraft disposal either in low-Earth orbit or in geosynchronous \norbit. These maneuvers are used either to have the spacecraft reenter in a location that \nis not hazardous, or put the spacecraft in an orbit where it will not harm other space-\ncraft. While not important during the early years of space exploration, the requirement \nto maintain a Clean space environment will become much more stringent in the future. \n\nWe must also maintain the orbit to overcome long-term secular perturbations, as \ndescribed in detail in Chap. 6. All geosynchronous spacecraft require orbit mainte-\nnance in the East-West direction to avoid interference and possible collisions with \nother spacecraft. Furthermore, most use orbit maintenance in a North-South direction \nto maintain a near-zero inclination. In low-Earth orbit, altitude maintenance is used to \novercome atmospheric drag and achieve a longer working life. Other orbit types, such \nas Sun-synchronous or repeating ground track, may also require orbit maintenance. \n\nNearly all constellations require some type of orbit maintenance to prevent \ncollisions between satellites and maintain the constellation pattern over time. In prin-\nciple, we could use relative stanonkeeping in which we maintain the relative positions \nbetween satellites but not their absolute position. In practice, however, this will make \norbit maintenance more complex and will not save propellant or reduce the number of \n\n11.7 Guidance and Navigation 509 \n\ncomputations. In a low-Earth orbit constellation with relative orbit maintenance, we \nwould, in principle, maintain all satellites in the constellation to decay at the same rate \nas the slowest-decaying satellite at any time. But the entire constellation would stilI \ndecay in this process. Therefore, it would slowly change its altitude and need to be \nreboosted at some later time. \n\nThe alternative is absolute stationkeeping, shown in Fig. 11-51. Here, we maintain \neach spacecraft within a mathematically defmed box moving with the constellation \npattern. As long as we maintain the constellation's altitude, absolute stationkeeping is \njust as efficient as relative stationkeeping. AIl in-track stationkeeping maneuvers are \ndone firing in the direction of motion to put energy taken out by atmospheric drag back \ninto the orbit We put in more or less energy at any given time, depending upon the \namount of drag and the atmospheric density, as described in Sec. 8.1.5. \n\nSatellite 1 Box \n\nTo Sun \n\nSatellite 4 Box \n\nFIg. 11-51. Constellation Statlonkeeplng Maintains Each SatellHe In a \"Box\" Rotating with \nthe Constellation. \n\nThe amount of drag makeup for any satellite in a constellation depends on the \nsatellite's observed drift relative to its assigned box. At the forward edge of the box, \nthe applied !:J. V is increased, thus increasing the orbit altitude and period and sliding \nthe satellite rearward in phase relative to the box. Similarly, at the trailing edge, the \napplied !:J. V is decreased, thus decreasing the altitude and period and sliding the satel-\nlite forward in phase. Because of the high spacecraft velocities in low-Earth orbit, \ntimekeeping is critical to maintaining the satellites' relative positions. A 1 sec differ-\nence in the time corresponds to a 7 km difference in in-track position. Maintaining the \nsame time throughout the constellation is important, but not difficult \n\nAlthough the perturbative forces are different, constellation maintenance in \nlow-Earth orbit is analogous to stationkeeping in geosynchronous orbit In-track \nand cross-track orbit maintenance in low-Earth orbit correspond to East-West and \nNorth-South stationkeeping, respectively, in geosynchronous orbit Because the forces \ninvolved are different, the correspondence is not exact. Altitude maintenance is \nnecessary in low-Earth orbit to overcome the effect of atmospheric drag. In geosyn-\n\n\n\n510 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7 \n\nchronousorbit. this would correspond to maintaining the mean drift rate relative to the \nsurface of the Earth at zero, so the stationkeeping box stays over a fixed location. In \nlow-Earth orbit. this corresponds to maintaining the box at a mathematically fixed p0-\nsition in the constellation. \n\nGround-Based vs. Autonomous Orbit Control \n\nTraditionally, orbit maintenance and control are executed from the ground. The re-\nquired orbit adjustment will be computed at the ground station, and a series of \ncommands will be generated which are uploaded to the spacecraft and then down-\nlinked for verification. Finally, the ground station sends a command to execute the \ncontrol commands, and the spacecraft carries them out based on an onboard clock. \nThis sequence protects the spacecraft against communications errors and allows \nmaneuvers when the spacecraft is out of sight of the ground station. The spacecraft is \noften out of sight because orbit maneuvers are usually 180 deg out of phase from the \ndesired result. For example, in landing on the Moon, the principal burns bring the \nspacecraft down to the Earth-facing side of the Moon and take the returning astronauts \nback to Earth. Both burns occur on the far side of the Moon, entirely out of sight of the \nEarth. \n\nIn normal geosynchronous stationkeeping the spacecraft is allowed to drift to one \nside of the stationkeeping box. A maneuver then changes its velocity so it will drift \nacross the box and back before needing another maneuver. This is similar to keeping \na ball in the air by continuously hitting it upward with a paddle. The main reason for \nthis sequence is that it maximizes the time interval between maneuvers and, therefore, \nminimizes the amount of ground operations, which carry the potential for communi-\ncations errors or command mistakes. \n\nIn the past. there was no realistic alternative to orbit control from the ground. Now, \nhowever, autonomous navigation systems have made autonomous orbit maintenance \npossible, economical, and safe. Autonomous orbit maintenance drives down the cost \nand risk of missions by having a major part of the day-to-day operations on board the \nspacecraft. As described in Sec. 2.1.2, autonomous oroit maintenance is a key compo-\nnent in a fully autonomous spacecraft bus, which can further reduce mission costs. \n(For further discussion of autonomous orbit control, see Wertz [1996, 2001), Wertz, \net al. [1997], KOnigsmann, et al. [1996], Collins, et al. [1996], or Glickman [1994}.) \nMicrocosm has developed a commercial, autonomous Orbit Control Kit flight soft-\nware system scheduled for flight validation on UoSAT-12 in 1999. 'This and other \napproaches are also scheduled to be flight tested later on EO-I which is intended to do \nformation flying with LandSat-7. \n\nOrbit and attitude control are analogous, with several important differences. \nTypically, we must control attitude moderately often or continuously if we are to avoid \nserious consequences. A satellite that loses attitude control will usually tumble and \nthen lose the payload function, power on the solar arrays, and contact with the ground. \nIt also may point sensitive 'instruments at the Sun or have substantial thermal \nproblems. Even a brief attitude control failure can destroy the mission. In contrast. \norbit control maneuvers occur infrequently, and any computer that can do autonomous \nnavigation will easily accommodate the necessary additional computations. As long as \nwe control the orbit with low-thrust systems (Sees. 75, 17.4), a short-term failure will \ncause no damage. Gravity takes care of short-term orbit control very well. If the \norbit-control system fails, the ground or the onboard system will determine that the \nsatellite is slowly drifting from its assigned slot and a warning can be issued with \n\n11.7 Guidance and Navigation \n511 \n\nadequate time to fix the problem or implement a back-up before adverse consequences \n\nOCC~ith autonomous orbit maintenance we can optimize characteristics other than the \ntime between maneuvers, such as the size of the control box. Just as we would not \nordinarily implement attitude control to minimize the number of commands sent to the \nmomentum wheel, we do not have to minimize the number of thruster firings so long \nas the duty cycle is within the range of th~ ~~ and the thruster pulses ~ long \nenough to achieve high efficiency. Ordinarily usmg many short pulses IS not a \nproblem, as thrusters are frequently used for attitude control and small thrusters have \nlifetimes far in excess of the required number of on-off cycles. \n\nFor some missions, autonomous orbit control is required simply because of the \nnature of the mission itself. This is the case for .planetary flybys or a mission t~ th~ far \nside of the Moon in which either the spacecraft IS out of contact or the commumcalions \ndelays are too long for normal ground control. Generally, ground s~tions do the o~bit\u00ad\ncontrol computations and upload them to ~e spacecraft fo~ e~ecution. at a later ~e. \nThis is a semi-autonomous approach which can meet IDlSSlon reqwrements while \nmaintaining ground control.. . . \n\nIn geosynchronous stationkeeping, the mal.n reason for autonomo~ Orolt ~\u00ad\ntenance is to reduce operations cost and nsk, rather than a specific teclmic~ \nrequirement.\" For a constellation at any aItil?de, the overall process of orbi~ de~rIDl\u00ad\nnation and control represents a major operational cost. It also represents a Significant \nrisk element in which any operational error or failure of the ground system could dam-\nage or destroy the constellation. The orbit maintenance o~ration is necessarily cu;ned \nout on board the spacecraft by firing thrusters. PerforIDlng the control computalio~ \non board the spacecraft can reduce both cost and risk. Frrst. it eliminates the ~ten~al \nfor operator error in a very repe~tive ~ction. ~econd, i.t ~uces commumcation \nerrors or failures frequently as8OC1ated W1th operational aCtivities. \n\nThe argument has been made that autonomous orbit control is a range-safety \nconcern because having a spacecraft adjust its orbit without operator oversight c~uld \nendanger other spacecraft or people. This is a reasonable conc~rn for firing high-\nthrust. large II V engines, but it is not a problem for low-thrust mruntenance. A w.atch-\ndog timer can easily limit the propulsive burn ~me to keep bums small. E~en If the \nwatchdog system fails, the amount of propellant m most low-thrust systems 18 too low \nto endanger other space systems or people on the ground. \n\nThe principal reason for not undertaking autonomous orbit ~tenance and \ncontrol for future missions is tradition. It has not been done that way m the past, and \nthere is a very strong desire in expensiv~ space mission~ to m~ntain ~ose. ~edures \nthat have worked previously. A mechamsm for overcommg this potential nsk IS super-\nvised autonomy in which orbit maintenance maneuvers are computed on board ~e \nspacecraft anll verification from the ground is ~uired before they are ex~. This \nallows mission personnel to gain confidence m the onboard computations before \npermitting fully autonomous operation. .,.\" \n\nA second alternative is to mplement \"autonomous orbit mruntenance from the \nground. In this case, the computations would be done autonomously, but would be \n\n\u2022 A technical requirement for autonomous orbit maintenance can arise in geosynchronous \nstationkeeping when there is a desire to place additional satellite~ in a D~W ~ slotlD this \ncase autonomoUs orbit maintenance is needed to reduce the SIZe of tile orbit-control dead-\nband, which would be impractical if we had to do frequent commanding from the ground. \n\n\n\n512 Spacecraft Subsystems 11.7 \n\ndone at the ground station and then sent to the spacecraft for execution. This has the \nadvantage of maintaining some characteristics of traditional orbit maintenance and \nalso minimizes the amount of hardware on board the spacecraft. Unfortunately, this \n~ppro~h can add significant complexity and risk to the mission. If the navigation data \nIS obtained on board the spacecraft, it would need to be communicated to the ground \nfor processing. Then, the results and commands would go to the spacecraft and be Ver-\nified for later execution. This makes the process much more complex and increases the \npotential for communications errors and transmitting the wrong data to the wrong \nspacecraft. Most likely, these disadvantages would outweigh any advantage of doing \nthe sm~l amount of command processing on the ground. If the spacecraft has enough \ncomputtng power on board, a reasonable alternative might be to compute the orbit con-\ntrol. on board the spacecraft and send it to the ground for verification and approval \nbefore actually executing the command. This allows full ground override. It also \nallows the system to use an on-orbit process with less cost and higher reliability, when-\never operators are confident that the system is working smoothly. \n\nIf the spacecraft navigation is done with the traditional approach of tracking from \nthe ground, doing the commanding from the ground and uploading commands to the \nspacecraft is an efficient alternative and minimizes the overall communication prob-\nlem. In this case, the traditional cost and complexity of orbit maintenance from the \nground remain, although it may be possible to reduce this somewhat with more \nautomation. \n\nAutonomous navigation and orbit control can significantly reduce the cost of space \noperations. For most space missions, this is a major cost. It should also reduce risk \nbecause there are fewer failure modes than with operator-driven or ground-based \nsystems. For modem spacecraft, almost no one would recommend doing attitude \ndetermination and control from the ground, even though this is a more complex task \nwit? more serious adverse consequences than orbit control. The main argument \nagatnst autonomous orbit determination and control is tradition-we have not done it \nthat way in the past and, therefore, should not do it in the future. \n\n11.7.4 Sizing Autonomous Guidance and Navigation \n\nThe implementation of a purely ground-based guidance and navigation system is \n!'<>th expensive and straightforward. This is the traditional approach, and is described \ntn detail in Chap. 14. The process is well established for geosynchronous spacecraft, \nlow-Earth orbit spacecraft, and interplanetary missions. \n\nThe main reason for considering autonomous guidance and navigation is to reduce \nmission cost and risk. But we can also extend mission life, put more spacecraft into a \ngeosynchronous slot, or undertake missions which we could not realistically do with-\nout some autonomy. \n\n. Orbit and attitude sensing and control are strongly interrelated. In many cases, they \nWIll use the same sensors and the same actuators. The attitude control sensors and \nactuators will need to control the spacecraft during orbit maneuvers, which will prob-\nably be the largest source of disturbance torques during the spacecraft's operating life. \nIn ad?ition. orbit and attitude budgets are often combined to produce pointing and \nmapptng budgets to satisfy mission requirements (see Fig. 4-6 and Sec. 5-4). Our goal \nshould be to reduce the total cost and risk of attitude and orbit determination and \ncontrol. (For an extended discussion of this objective. see Wertz [2(01).) \n\nIn most cases. we would meet our objective of minimum cost. weight, and risk by \ncombining elements of orbit and attitude determination and control. Unfortunately. \n\n11.7 Guidance and Navigation 513 \n\nthis may be difficult to achieve in practice. Traditionally. attitude determination and \ncontrol is the responsibility of a controls organization. and is a well-defined element \nof the spacecraft bus. Orbit determination and control. on the other hand, is usually the \nresponsibility of a systems organization which will ultimately implement this function \non the ground. The guidance and navigation function is ordinarily not allocated weight \nor power on board the spacecraft ~d is not c~idered a normal spacecraft ~ction. \nThis chapter contains separate secbons on the attitude control system and the gwdance \nand navigation system because these are normally separate functions. Getting these \nfunctions to work together is perhaps the single largest hurdle in developing autono-\nmous navigation and orbit control and. therefore, fully autonomous spacecraft. \n\nTABLE 11-67.

Would probably use spacecraft computer. \n\nThe problem of combining orbit and attitude systems is illustrated by Table 11-67. \nwhich provides size, weight, and power for alternative autonomous navigation sys-\ntems. Several of the systems. such as the GPS receivers. are orbit-only. although in the \nfuture they may be expanded to include attitude as well. Other systems, such as MANS \nand the Space Sextant, do both the attitude and orbit function. In these cases. one \nshould look at the difference in weight and power required to achieve navigation from \nthat required for attitude alone. Even this assessment is complicated because orbit \ndetermination requires computer resources which may be regarded as a Pm:t of the \nattitude control system, the navigation system, the command and data handling sys-\ntem, or the general spacecraft computer. For many of the systems, such as .lan~k \ntracking or crosslink navigation, the computer is the principal element assOCIated WIth \n\n\n\n514 Spacecraft Subsystems \n\nautonomous navigation and control. The main message is to avoid \"double booking\" \ncomponents for guidance and navigation and to look at the joint implementation of \norbit and attitude determination and control when beginning to optimize system \nperformance. \n\nAutonomous navigation and orbit maintenance is too new to have a standard imple-\nmentation in terms of where computations are done. But the nature of the \ncomputations themselves and the data used suggest a natural configuration: using a \nsingle spacecraft processor for determining and controlling the attitude and orbit. \nThese functions will probably use .either the same or similar sensors and may use the \nsame actuators. Most of the computing is associated with sensor processing, data \nhandling, and anomaly resolution. The orbit and attitude computations themselves are \nnormally much smaller. The implementation of either orbit or attitude control \nalgorithms represents by far the smallest part of the throughput requirement. Thus, \ncontrol adds little burden for any processor which is already determining the orbit or \nattitude. \n\nA reasonable initial design would incorporate all of these functions in a single \nspacecraft processor. Actual implementation may vary, depending upon the specific \nhardware and software. For example, star-sensor processing may be incorporated \nwithin the star sensor itself, or may be done in the same processor as other orbit or \nattitude functions. The overall objective, however, should continue to be to minimize \nthe cost and risk of determining and controlling the orbit and attitude for the entire \nmission. \n\nReferences \n\nAgrawal, Brij N. 1986.

A system designer must understand this \nprocess because hardware manufacture and test heavily influence the program's cost \nand schedule. In addition, testing technology and special facility requirements may \naffect program feasibility. This chapter is oriented principally toward the construction \nof a single satellite or the first satellite of a production run. See Sec. 19.1 for a dis-\ncussion of the \"production line\" approach applicable to building satellites in large \nnumbers such as those which are a part of a large constellation. \n\nTable 12-1 lists the names we use in this chapter to describe the parts of a space-\ncraft. For example, piece parts are individual parts, including transistors, integrated \ncircuits, or mechanical parts such as housings, panels, bearings, and gears. A com-\nponent is a complete unit or black box such as a transmitter, receiver, computer, or \nelectromechanical actuator. Sometimes a functional group of parts, or assembly, is \nmanufactured or tested together. An assembly as used here may be part of a component \nor may be integrated directly into the spacecraft. Subsystems consist of groups of \ncomponents. They may be assembled and tested as subsystems or integrated into the \nspacecraft as components. \n\nTABLE 12-1. Hardware Nomenclature. Spacecraft are built up from subsystems. which are \ncomposed of components. \n\nPiece Part Individual part such as resistor. Integrated Circuit, bearing. circuit board. or \nhousing \n\nComponent Complete functional unit such as a control electronics assembly. an antenna, \na battery. or a power control unit \n\nAssembly Functional group of parts such as a hinge assembly. an antenna feed, or \na deployment boom \n\nSubsystem All of the components and assembnes that comprise a spacecraft subsystem \n\nSpacecraft Complete vehicle \n\n519 \n\n\n\n520 Spacecraft Manufacture and Test \n\nMethods for the manufacture\u00b7 and test of spacecraft and spacecraft components \nderive from the aircraft and electronics industries. But spacecraft hardware is less \nplentiful and less accessible for maintenance. In spacecraft production, a run of lOis \nhigh volume and spacecraft recalls are extremely rare. Furthermore, environmental \nforces severely stress the hardware during launch. \n\nThe theory of type test (see Table 12-2) is a basic principle affecting the manu-\nfacture and test of spacecraft hardware. Type test theory depends on preparing and \ncontrolling complete and exact engineering data (drawings, specifications, and proce-\ndures). If the engineering data controls the hardware constructiOt;l completely, all items \nbuilt to the same data are equivalent and the results of any single-item test are valid for \nall like items. In particular, if a representative article (type test article) passes a \nsequence of qualification tests, all other articles built to the same engineering data \nshould also pass. In other words, the design is qualified. We simply have to llllIke sure \narticles are identical by controlling the engineering data and manufacturing processes. \nLess severe acceptance tests then certify proper workmanship. \n\nTABLE 12-2. Theory of Type Testing. The type test theory is the basis for qualification testing. \n\nBasis Engineering data Is complete and exact. \nEngIneering data completely controls manufacture. \nAU items manufactured to the same engineering data are Identical. \n\nTherefore Results of qualification test for one article are valId for all articles. \n\nTable 12-3 lists the steps in manufacturing, integrating, and testing a spacecraft. As \nsystem designers, we must determine how long each step will take and identify any \ntest or facility requirement that is risky or peculiar to the program. Above all, we \nshould schedule qualification tests to qualify the spacecraft completely before launch. \nThe following sections address these steps and describe important aspects of system \ndesign. \n\nTABLE 12-3.

Most aerospace companies use similar standards. \nVarious documents combine to control the hardware manufacture. Each piece part, \nassembly, or component is described by its own individual drawing, and drawing call \nouts describe materials and processes. Drawing numbers identify parts. In the same \nway, drawings control assembly of parts into higher-level assemblies and identify \nintegration hardware. Drawings also control interfaces. size. shape, and mounting \nprovisions. \n\nTABLE 12-4.

It \nincludes identifying the engineering data required for manufacture (configuration \nidentification), controlling changes, maintaining the engineering database (configura-\ntion control), reviewing and auditing the engineering data (configuration audit), and \nverifying that the hardware is built as designed (configuration verification). Changes \nto the engineering data (engineering change orders and procedure change orders) are \nalso tracked. For military contracts, MIL-SID 483, MIL-SID 1521, and DOD-SID \n480 itemize configuration-management requirements. Most aerospace contractors \nhave systems that conform to these standards. \n\n12.2 Manufacture of IDgh-Reliability Hardware \n\nThe first step in manufacturing spacecraft hardware is to translate the engineering \ndata into manufacturing plans, flows, instructions, manufacturing aids, and tooling. \nThis occurs as the design matures and manufacturing personnel may influence .the \ndesign for ease of manufacture. Engineering data is formally released at a Critical \nDesign Review. Typically, we review manufacturing plans at this time or in' a \nManufacturing Readiness Review shortly afterward. \n\nThe manufacturing planning starts with subassemblies by generating parts kits, \npreparing detailed procedures for assembly, and identifying inspection and test \nrequirements. We must also identify special facilities (such as clean rooms); manufac-\nturing methods, precautions, and controls; and training and certification levels of \npersonnel. Based on these plans, we then call out the manufacturing steps in detailed \nprocedures. A copy of the procedures travels with the hardware and is checked off as \n\n\u2022 Military specifications and standards are no longer being maintained and are due to be super-\nseded by industty standards which are not yet in place. \n\n\n\n522 Spacecraft Manufacture and Test 12.2 \n\nthe steps are completed. This paper becomes part of the permanent record of the \nassembly. Inspection and test results are also part of the record, and some installations \ninclude photographs of each assembly. \n\nManufacturers buy most mw materials from certified vendors. who certify the \nmaterial quality. They buy electronic piece parts to meet individual specifications \nwhich call out performance and quality requirements. Under current pmctices. high-\nreliability electronic parts are constructed for a particular program. Such procurement \ntakes a long time. and most parts undergo extensive testing before combining into \ncomponents. Flight hardware usually requires the highest level of reliability. which in \nthe past has been called S-level. Lower reliability parts may work for prototype and \nqualification units not intended for flight. In addition to vendor lead times. each part \norder must be bid and negotiated, which adds weeks to the procurement time. The cur-\nrent pmctice is to have the part supplier test each part for performance (group A tests) \nand a sample from each lot to extremes (group B and C tests). The manufacturer burns \nthe parts in while monitoring their performance and does a destructive physical anal-\nysis (DPA test) on a sample. \n\nThe industry is currently undergoing a major revision in the way that parts are spec-\nified and procured. In the Department of Defense this is called \"Acquisition Reform\" \nand is chamcterized by elimination of govermilent specifications and standards for \nparts and processes. Industry is expected to replace these specifications and standards \nwith their own controls or use Professional Society Standards. A consistent set of such \nstandards is not yet in place although efforts are under way to produce them (see for \ninstance AlAA Recommended Practice for Parts Managemen~ AIAA R-1OO-1996). \nExtensive parts information is also available on the Internet at Air Force and NASA \nsites. \n\nTo contend with the lead times for parts and materials. manufacturers must order \nthem before they see component engineering data. Thus. we establish a Project \nApproved Parts List (PAPL) and Project Approved Materials List (PAML) early in \nthe program. Because designers must use the preferred part or identify and justify \nnew parts. these approved lists reduce the number of part types and allow early \nprocurement. \n\nManufacturing facilities cover mechanical manufacturing, electronic manufactur-\ning, spacecraft assembly and test, and special functions. Mechanical manufacturing \nincludes standard machine shops, plus locations for mechanical assembly, plating and \nchemical treatment, composite manufacture, adhesive bonding, and elevated temper-\nature treatment. Although most aerospace facilities are quite clean,mechanical \nmanufacturing does not normally need controlled c1eanIiness. But electromechanical \nand optical manufacturing, as well as the tailoring of thermal blankets, do need \ncontrolled clean rooms-normally sepamte from conventional mechanical manufac-\nturing. Table 12-5 shows c1eanIiness requirements for various opemtions. \n\nElectronic manufacturing facilities include areas for building printed circuits and \nclean rooms for buildfug and testing electronic assemblies. Test facilities may include \nanechoic chambers and screen rooms containing various types of geneml-purpose test \nequipment as well as special purpose testers for circuit boards and components. \nComponent tests may also require environmental test faciIities. \n\nSpacecraft assembly and test opemtions are normally conducted in controlled-\ncleanliness facilities, which are often high-bay hangars. Spacecraft functional tests are \nconducted with special purpose test sets. Spacecraft environmental testing requires \nlarge vibmtion and thermal-vacuum equipment. \n\n12.3 \nInspection and QnaHty Assurance 523 \n\nTABLE 12-5. FacUlty Cleanliness Requirements (FED STD 209).

Payload ~s1:rUr?ents that req~ cryO~~~IC \ntemperatures, absence of magnetic fields, or RF lsolation call for spectal facilities \nwhich may increase program cost and schedule. \n\n12.3 Inspection and Quality Assurance \n\nQuality assurance verifies that the manufacture and testing o~ the sp~ and its \ncom nents conform to engineering data. MIL Q 9858A descnbes quality assurance \nfor :itary progmms. Table 12-6 lists its elements: quality. program management, \nfacilities and standards control of purchases, and manufacturmg control. . \n\nA key element in th~ quality program is establishing ~ints ?n ~e PJ'O?ucti?n flow \nwhere we can make sure the hardware construction compbes WIth Its ~gmeenng data \nbefore the next step keeps us from inspecting it. In S?me cases. ~ontro~g the process \non the production line will ensure the hardware quality. Process mspection and control \nthus substitutes for direct test. . \n\nWe must also verify that vendors supplying spacecraft hardware: ha~e satisf~ry \nquality assurance progmms by certifying their progmms and penodicaIly auditing \n\ntheir performance. . proced. . \nTest surveillance involves certifying test equipment and. ures, wttnessmg \n\ntests, approving test records, and reviewing results. Test eqwpment ~ormally COJ)-\nforms to a reduced set of controlled engineering data such ~ ~echamcal assembly \ndmwings, parts lists, wire lists, panel photo~phs. and ~~tion test procedores. \nTest surveillance personnel certify the construction and caIibmtion of the test set. They \napprove hardware tests and they prepare and control the test data package. They also \nformally review test ~u1ts before the next opemti~n proceeds .. Generally, the test \nconductor chairs the test review board, but test surveillance proVldes the records and \ndocuments the results for the archives. . \n\nQuality assurance must maintain data records for fo~ tests and failures. Often \nquality-assurance people keep all failed parts and record f~ure and anomaly remits. \nso they can identify repetitive failures and correct the desIgn weakilesses. AlthDugh \nformal procedures govern tests, troubleshooting may deviate from them. For sucb \nopemtions. quality assurance approves and maintains records of the exact steps \n\ninvolved. \n\n\n\n524 Spacecraft Manufacture and Test \n\nTABLE 12-6.

Flow of Qualification Testing for Components. A component is qualified by a \nseries of functional tests and exposure to environmental condItions. \n\nA component must withstand vibration caused when lawrch vehicle acoustics and \nengine rumble couple to it through its structural mowrt. Vibration is a random-signal \nspectrum of frequencies from 20 Hz to 2,000 Hz. Chapter 18 gives vibration data for \ncurrent lawrch vehicles. Figure 12-2 shows the vibration level for the Atlas-Centaur, \nas well as acceptance and qualification spectra [General Pynamics Space Systems \nDivision, 1988]. The acceptance spectrum envelops the expected environment and is \nhigher than the conducted level specified by the lawrch-vehicle contractor to accowrt \nfor structural resonances and acoustic input The qualification spectrum is uniformly \n6 dB higher than the acceptance spectrum. To vibrate a component, an electromechan-\nical shaker drives its base at a specified level of acceleration. \n\nComponents experience shocks from explosive release devices such as aero-\ndynamic fairing separation or spacecraft separation bolts. The shock pulse is a \ncomplex wave which induces mechanical response over a wide band of frequencies. \nThe pulse is specified by the peak acceleration response it excites in a mechanical sys-\ntem with 5% damping-as a function of the mechanical system's resonant frequency. \nChapter 18 shows shock-response spectra for various lawrch phenomena. Figure 12-3 \nshows the response spectra for acceptance and qualification of an Atlas-Centaur \ndevice. We can use an electromechanical shaker to produce a shock pulse for compo-\nnent testing, or we can mowrt the component on a test structure and hit the structure \nwith a calibrated hammer blow. \n\n\n\nr 526 Spacecraft Manufacture and Test 12.4 \n\n_ 0.1 \n\n~ \nf 0.01 \n\nComponent QuaJJficaIion i\"I... \n20.74 9 rms Overall \" CompOnent AccepIance 10~ grmsOverall \n\nI\\.. \nV 'I \" \n\nI \n0.001 \n\nif Boaster InteIface \n) 2.7 9 rms Overall \n\n0.0001 \nI \n\nI \n10 100 1,000 10,000 \n\nFrequency (Hz) \n\nRg.12-2.

Typical Temperature Cycle for Thermal-Vacuum Test of Components. The key \nissues on the thermal-vacuum test are temperature extremes, pressure level and \nnumber of cycles necessary. \n\nWe do not always know what a spacecraft \"component\" is. For example, we may \ndefme the solar array and individual antennas as components and qualify them sepa-\nrately, or we may test them environmentally as a part of the complete spacecraft. The \nstructure is tested by static loading but receives its environmental exposure as a part \nof the spacecraft. Mechanical assemblies, such as deployment joints or hinges, may be \ntested at qualification environmental levels separately as components or as part of the \nspacecraft. \n\nThe qualification program should evaluate each spacecraft function and all \nenvironmental effects the spacecraft may encounter. Table 12-8 lists the steps for \ndesigning a qualification program. FlfSt, we must prepare a list of all spacecraft and \npayload functions, as well as equipment (including redundancy), all modes of 0p:-\neration (including failure modes and backups), and software code. The system and \nsubsystem specifications should provide this information. Second, we identify envi-\nronmental effects, including those on the launch vehicle (acoustics, vibration, and \nshock) and in orbit (temperature, vacuum, and radiation). Third, we check to see which \nspacecraft functions must be tested with each environment Fourth, we identify the \nmajor spacecraft configurations that require qualification, typically including a boost \n\n\n\nr \nt! 528 Spacecraft Manufacture and Test 12.4 \n\nconfiguration and one or more on-orbit configurations. Fifth, we devise functional \nt~ts for each of these major configurations which completely evaluate the spacecraft. \n~IXth? we layout the sequence of tests and environmental exposures.

Besides \nproving the design, it may also be the first chance to evaluate the entire spacecraft in \noperation. Some parts of the qualification test may provide data to validate the engi-\nneering design and verify proper interaction of the equipment. Assembling the first \nunit is particularly difficult because components are seldom available in the best se-\nquence and unexpected interference and test peculiarities always occur. All operations \nmust be planned and executed under control and quality surveillance. Records must be \nmaintained and the results of each integration and test step reviewed before proceeding \nto the next operation. Typically, tests to qualify a spacecraft last more than a year. \n\nSpacecraft integration normally starts with delivery of an assembled structure or \nstrueturaI frame. Liquid propulsion parts are assembled to the structure first because \nthe fields used to braze them together are not compatible with electronic components. \nThe spacecraft wiring harness can go on before or after the propulsion components. \n\nElectronic assembly of the spacecraft commonly starts with electric power and \ncommand and data handling subsystem components. Integration of the remaining sub-\nsystems depends more on the particular design. Although the subsystems may have \nbeen preassembled and functionally teste'd, it is more common to integrate compo-\nnents one at a time and test the subsystems after they are integrated on the spacecraft. \n\nTo test a spacecraft, a crew normally uses central control and display equipment, \nwith a computer for command generation, telemetry decoding, logging, display, and \nautomated test sequences. They operate the equipment by keyboard and monitor status \nby video displays. These displays typically consist of an event screen that shows all \nsignal activity and page displays devoted to particular subsystem parameters. The test \nset also provides stimuli and data-measurement equipment for end-to-end testing of \nthe spacecraft and payload subsystems. A complete spacecraft test may take several \ndays to run and involve subroutines for each subsystem or functional group. Such a \ntest is called an integrated system test (1ST) or a comprehensive system test (CST). It. \nuses subroutines that test each subsystem, so we need to rerun only the subroutine for \na subsystem anomaly. We may also use a short version of this functional test at se-\nlected points in the integration flow. \n\nThe qualification test sequence normally matches the expected flight sequence: \nvibration, shock, and thermal vacuum. We also configure the spacecraft to match the \noperational sequence by folding the solar array and deployables during vibration test \nand deploying or removing them during thermal vacuum. Often the test facilities will \nlimit the test article's size or the ability to perform particular tests. Figure 12-5 shows \na typical sequence along with the special test facilities used [Reeves, 1979]. Frrst, the \nmechanically integrated spacecraft goes through temperature cycling to verify proper \nassembly. A comprehensive system test and performance testing of the payload then \ntake place in a special test facility. (For a communications satellite, this might be an \nanechoic chamber or screen room.) Separate performance testing of the solar arrays \nprecedes their integration with the spacecraft. Vibration tests consist of acoustic \ntesting and vibration by low-frequency sine waves. The system must also pass a pyro-\nshock test-firing of the deployment ordnance-and a check of the mechanical \ndeployments. Once the deployables are restowed, a thermal vacuum test of the folded \nconfiguration follows. After demonstrating the deployments again, the test crew then \nremoves the deployables so the spacecraft will fit into the thermal vacuum (TV) \nchamber. The spacecraft is then thermal vacuum tested in its orbital configuration. The \n\n\n\nr ~ \nI \n\n530 Spacecraft Manufacture and Test 12.6 \n\ndeployable units are tested in parallel With the spacecraft. An ambient comprehensive \nsystem test and mechanical verification series complete the qualification. Integrated \nsystem tests (shorter functional tests) supplement this sequence between each environ-\nmental exposure and during TV test. \n\n\u2022 MechanIca!Iy IntegJate \nthe Spamcraft \n\n\u2022 Assemble Structure \n\u2022 \\ntegTate Propulsion \n\u2022 InstaD E1ec1ron1cs \n\n\u2022 Comprehar1sIv& System \nTest \n\n\u2022 Test of aD SysIems WhIle \nThermaDy cycJing \n\n\u2022 Temperature Chamber \n\n\u2022 Deployable Release Test \n\u2022 Rre Release Devices \n\nand Verily Rrat Motion \n\nRemove Solar Array \nand DeployabJes \n\nInstaD Solar Array \nand DepIoyabJes \n\n\u2022 VIbration Test \n\u2022 Low Frequency Sine \nWaves Sweep \n\n\u2022 AoousIIc Test at \nQuallllcalion Level \n\n\u2022 AoousIIc Chamber \n\n\u2022 Thermal Vacuum Test \nIn Launch ConfIguration \n\n\u00b7TVChamber \n\n\u2022 Thermal Vacuum Test \nIn 0IbIIaI ConfIguration \n\n\u00b7TVChamber \n\n\u2022 Solar\" Array Test \n\u2022 Rash Chamber \n\nFig. 12-5.

Note that system tests are performed after each \nmajor activity. \n\nDuring the qualification sequence, the test Crew records all anomalies or out-of-\ntolerance measurements and formally resolves each discrepancy. Anomalies which \nresult from operator error or malfunctioning test equipment and which do not damage \n!he ~~ are easy to resolve. But spacecraft malfunctions demand thorough \nmvestigation. If design errors have caused the problems, the design must be corrected \nand retested.

The time required for launch site activity may vary \nfrom several months to several days. \n\nNormally, one of the launch-site test hangars houses the spacecraft test set for \nperformance testing nearby. Crews install propulsion in an explosive ordnance area. \nThey mate the launch vehicle and spacecraft. load propellant, and install ordnance on \nstand. Trained people conduct these hazardous tasks, using appropriate equipment and \nsafeguards. Some spacecraft components can be replaced at the launch site and even \non stand, but restricted access to the spacecraft usually makes replacement difficult. \nMuch time at the launch site goes simply to monitoring the spacecraft's state of health \nthrough hard-line connections or, during some integrated tests, through RF Jinks. \nSpacecraft commanding is strictly controlled. Launch procedures include configuring \nthe spacecraft for launch and removing hard lines. \n\nReferences \n\nGeneral Dynamics Space Systems Division. 1988.

This chapter discusses this arrangement of links, \ntheir operation, and their effect on system design. More detailed information on \nsatellite communications is available in Morgan and Gordon [1989] and Sklar [1988]. \n\nTable 13-1 lists the steps required to specify the communications architecture. The \nfirst step is to define the mission objectives and requirements in enough detail to \nevaluate and compare alternative architectures. Section 13.1 describes alternative \nconfigurations and the criteria used in their selection. \n\nThe second step is to determine the data rates for each of the links identified in \nstep 1. To do this it is necessary that the required data throughput accuracy of data \ntransmission be specified. and whether or not there will be data processing on board \nthe satellite. This process is described in Sec. 13.2. \n\nThe third step is to design each link in the network, as explained in Sec. 133. \nPrincipal factors are the availability of a radio frequency spectrum, coverage area of \nthe satellite antenna beam. and path length between satellite and ground station.

The fourth step, described in Sec.J3.4, provides informa-\ntion to aid the reader in estimating the size and mass of the satellite antennas, and \nprimary power and mass of the satellite transmitters. These parameters are inputs to \nthe spacecraft design process described in Chap. ] 0, and the ground system design \nprocess described in Chap. ]5. \n\n13.1 Communications Architecture \n\nA communications architecture is a network of satellites and ground stations \ninterconnected by communication Jinks. The term ground station is equivaJent to \nEarth station, ground terminal, and Earth terminal, including land mobile, airborne, \nand shipborne terminals. All of these names refer to the same thing: the antenna, trans-\nmitter, receiver, and control equipment required to communicate with the satellite. \n\nCommunication Jinks allow a sateUite system to function by carrying tracking, \ntelemetry, and command data or mission data between its elements. Figure 13-1 \nillustrates the ground station-to-satellite uplinks, sateJ1ite-to-ground station downlinks, \nand satellite-to-satellite crosslinks, or intersatellite links, that support a space system. \nNot shown are additional communication links which may be necessary to transfer \ndata between the ground stations and a mission control center or users. For example, \nthe Air Force's Satellite Control Network uses the DSCS-ID communications satellite \nto relay data between remote tracking stations and the satellite control facility in \nCalifornia. \n\nIn space systems, the transmitter and receiver must be in view of each other, using \nfrequencies high enough (above 100 MHz) to easily penetrate the Earth's ionosphere. \n\n13.1 Communications Architecture \n535 \n\nA satellite in a nongeostationary orbit is often out of view of its user's ground station. \nIn this case a second satellite, usually in a ~eostationary orbit, ~y be ~ to ~Ia! \nd ta between the sateUite and its ground station. The ground station-to-satellite link IS \n; forward link. and the satellite-to-ground station Jink is the return link.

The Communications ArchItectUre Conslste of Satellites and Ground StaUons \n\nInterconnected with Communications Unks. \n\nSince 1990 several new classes of satellites in the orbital category of low-Earth \norbit (LEO) ~d medium-Earth orbit (MEO) have been developed for various com-\nmercial uses. They will be used for both satellite-based cellular telephone service as \nwell as for wideband data trunking (fiber optic type service where there is no fiber) \nand data distribution for Internet-type services. \n\nIn these new systems, the terms forward link and return link sometimes take on new \ndefinitions. As in terrestrial cellular, the forward link for a satellite-based cell~ar \nsystem is from the ground station (gateway) to the user terminal ~ or radiC?\" \ntelephone, and the return link is from the radiotelephone to the ground station. In this \nterminology, both the forward and return links contain uplinks and downlinks to and \nfrom the satellite. . \n\nA constellation at an altitude of 1,000-1,500 Ian typicaIJy requires from 48 to 64 \nsatellites to provide complete Earth coverage. A constellation at 10,000 Ian typicaIJy \nrequires 12 satellites. \n\n13.1.1 Communications Arcbitectore Defined by Satellite-Ground \nStation Geometry \n\nThe geometry formed by sateJ1ite orbits and ground stations de~nes th~ b~c \ncommunications architectures illustrated in Fig. 13-2.

In this configuration, the satellite orbits at low altitude (under 1,000 km), \nreceives data. and stores it in memory. When it moves in view of a receiver ground \nstation, the satellite transmits the stored data. This architecture permits the use of a \nlow-cost launch vehicle due to the low-altitude orbit. The satellite cost is also lower \n\n13.1 Communications Arcbitecture 537 \n\nTABLE 13-2. Comparison of five Example Communications Architecture. \n\nArchitecture Advantages Disadvantages \n\nA.

Usually satellite stationkeep-\ning is not required. The principal disadvantage of this architecture is its long access \ntime and transmission delay, perhaps hours, waiting for the satellite to pass into view \nof the user ground station. \n\nThere are several commercial systems planning to use store-and-forward commu-\nnication for very low-cost service. They include ORBCOMM, Starsys, Vita. LEO-I, \nF AI, and ESat. They typically operate in the VHF portion of the radio spectrum at very \nlow bandwidths. These are sometimes referred to as \"little LEOs.\" \n\nGeostationary Orbit (Fig. 13-2B): Virtually all communication relay satellite \nsystems and many meteorologicaI satellites use this architecture, in which the satellite \nis placed in a near-zero deg inclination orbit at 35,786 kIn altitude. The period of the \norbit is exactly equal to the period of the Earth's rotation, making the satellite ~~ \nstationary when viewed from the ground (see Sec. 6.1). The cost of ~~d stations ~s \nusually less for this architecture because little or no antenna pomting control IS \n\nI --\n\n\n\n[1 \n538 Communications Arcbiteetore \n\n13.1 \n\nrequired. A stationary network is far easier to set up, monitor, and control compared \nto a dynamic network containing nonstationary (relative to Earth) satellites. There is \nno need to switch from one satellite to another, for the satellite is always in view of the \nground station. Principal disadvantages are lack of coverage above 70-deg latitude and \nthe high launch cost Furthermore, the delay time for propagation to and from the \nsynchronous orbit is about 0.25 sec, which sometimes causes problems (echoes, \nacknowledgment protocols) in communications satellite systems. \n\nMolniya Orbit (Fig. 13-2C): The Russian space program uses this architecture to \ncover the northern polar regions. The satellites are in highly elliptical orbits with an \napogee of 40,000 km, a perigee of 500 km, and an inclination angle of 63.4 deg (see \nSec. 6.1). The apogee is over the North Pole to cover northern latitudes. The period of \nthe orbit is 12 hr, but because it is highly elliptical, the satellite spends about 8 hr of \neach period over the northern hemisphere. Two or more satellites orbit in different \nplanes, phased so that at least one is always in view from all northern latitudes. \nUnfortunately, the Molniya orbit requires continuous changing of antenna pointing \nangles at the ground station and switching links between satellites as they move in and \nout of view. \n\nGeostationary Orbit with Crosslink (Fig. 13-20): When a geostationary satellite is \nbeyond line-of-sight of a ground station, a second geostationary satellite relays data \nbetween it and the station. A relay satellite is better than a double-hop link using two \nadjacent ground stations as a relay (shown in Fig. 13-2B), because the relay ground \nstations must often be on foreign territory, which is more costly, less secure, and less \nsurvivable. The obvious disadvantage of this architecture is the added relay satellite \nand its crosslink, which increase the system's complexity, risk, and cost. \n\nLow ATtitude (Fig. 13-2E): This architecture places 20 or more satellites in low-\naltitude (500 to 3,000 km) orbits and sometimes connects them with crosslinks. The \nsystem divides digital messages into packets of a few hundred or thousand bits, labels \neach packet with time-of-day and its destination, and then transmits it in a short burst. \nPackets may arrive by different paths with different propagation times, depending on \nthe satellite-ground station geometry at the time of transmission. The receiving station \nmust sort and reassemble the packets in the correct order to obtain the original mes-\nsage. Because so many alternate paths are available, the system is highly survivable. \nThe low-altitude orbit also improves immunity to jamming from the ground since the \nsatellite sees a smaller Earth area. Finally, the uplink transmitter power is lower due to \nthe shorter distance between ground station and satellite, making unauthorized recep-\ntion less probable. On the other hand, this architecture needs complex network \nsynchronizing and control functions because of relative motion between satellites and \nground stations. Without stationkeeping, the satellites may drift together in bunches, \nleaving gaps in the coverage which lead to significant link outages. \n\nNote: The satellite-based cellular telephone service mentioned in paragraph 13.1 \nand Table 13-2 and below do not use packet transmission as described above, but typ-\nically CDMA or TDMA waveforms. \n\nThere are several classes of nongeostationary, low- and medium-altitude satellites \nWhich have begun to appear since about 1990. These are: \n\n\u2022 Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) Cellular Satellites. These are the systems such as \nIridium, Globalstar, and Ellipso which provide cellular telephone-type service \nto hand-held and mobile phones from the low-Earth orbits. \n\n13.1 Communications Architecture 539 \n\n\u2022 Little Low-Earth Orbit (Little LEO) Satellites.

Thus the \nsatellites may be shared among many nonsimultaneous users, using multiple-access \ntechniques described in Sec. 13.5 (see Chap. 2 of Morgan and Gordon [1989]) .. \n\nThe satellite communications architecture may be affected by data processmg on \nboard the satellite. Usually data collected by a satellite is transmitted direct!y to the \nuser via the downlink. However, the data often requires processing to make it ~ful. \nIf the system contains many ground stations, processiJ;lg the data in the sate~te and \nthen transmitting it may be more economical than hav!ng each user process.lt separ-\nately.

Communications Architectures may be Defined by the Function Performed. \nOpen circles represent a relay satellite. \n\nOperators at ground (air, ship) stations usually control the mission in (near) real \ntime by transmitting commands to the satellite. When the satellite is not in view of the \nground-control station during part of its orbit, commands previously received and \nstored in the satellite are executed by an onboard timer. The advantages of this \napproach are flexibility to changing requirements, greater reliability, and a less \ncomplex, lower-cost satellite. The disadvantages are vulnerability to human error or \nfailure of the ground control facility. Costs for the ground control segment, especially \noperations, can be high. \n\nOn the other hand, the satellite itself can control a mission by using onboard data-\nsensing and programmed decision-making processes. This arrangement replaces \nground control, is highly survivable, has fast response time (communication link \ndelays eIiminated), excludes errors iptroduced by human operators, and reduces \nground equipment and operations cost. But it is less responsive to changing or unan-\n\n13.1 Communications Arcbitecture 541 \n\nticipated requirements, and the satellite itself is more complex, more costly, and \npotentially less reliable. Even when using an autonomous control architecture, a \nground station is generally required to collect data from the spacecraft and to serve as \na backup to the onboard control system. \n\nUsuaIly, ground stations control unmanned satellites to simplify the satellite \ndesign. In the future we expect more functions, such as stationkeeping, to be \nperformed in the satellite to reduce the dependence on the ground station control (see \nSec. 16.1). \n\nDuring the operation of a satellite system, the communication links may need to be \nreconfigured, or its parameters, such as power or bandwidth, adjusted to accommodate \na change in requirements. The process for doing this is called network control. \ncommunications architectures may require a number of control functions \n(Table 13-3). Early satellites, such as Sputnik, did not need these functions because \ntheir systems used only one satellite, a single satellite-to-ground link, and a broadbeam \nantenna. . On the other hand, a communications satellite system such as the NASA \nACfS [Naderi and Kelly, 1988] contains many narrowbeam satellite antennas with \ndemodulators and switching circuits. This architecture requires a sophisticated system \nfor network control. Network control can be centralized using a single ground station \nor satellite, or distributed with multiple ground stations or satellites. Distributed con-\nfigurations use a control hierarchy, or set of priorities, to avoid conflicts. Distributed \ncontrol makes the network less vulnerable to failure of a single control element (see \nChap. 14 for further details) . \n\nTABLE 13-3.

For example, a commercial company will try to reduce \ncost and risk, but the military may make survivability the top priority. The factors \nwhich affect the criteria are explained below: \n\nOrbit: The satellite orbit determines how much time the satellite is in view by the \nground station and the potential need for intersatellite links. The satellite altitude \ndetermines the Earth coverage, and the satellite orbit determines the delay between \npasses over a specified ground station. Together, orbit and altitude set the number of \nsatellites needed for a specified continuity of coverage (see Sec. 7.2). Transmitter \npo,,:,er and antenna size depend on the distance between the satellites and the ground \ns~ti~ns (see Sec. 13.3). Satellite view time determines the signal-acquisition and \nnnsslOn-control complexity (see Chap. 14). \n\nIn the satellite-cellular systems described above, intersatellite links are not neces-\nsarily used. Instead, the constellation is designed so that at least one satellite is in view \nby the ~teway and every user at all times, so that there are no \"outages.\" Coverage is \ndeternnned by the number of satellites, the inclination of their orbits, the latitude of the \ngateway and user, and the number of gateways located around the world, if intersatel-\nlite links are not used. \n\nIf intersatellite links are used, then the number of gateways and their location \n~omes ~uc~ less cri~cal, as many satelli~ can connect to a single gateway through \nmtersatellite links. Vanous systems proceeding now have used different philosophies \nwith respect to intersatellite links, which can have great effect on the capital cost of the \nsystem. Intersatellite links make the satellites more expensive, but eliminate the need \nfor many fairly expensive ground stations (gateways), for example. \n\nThere are many systems proposed in various frequency bands which use not only \nthe geostationary orbit, the low-Earth orbit discussed above, and also what is called a \nmedium-Earth orbit (MEO), which ranges in altitude from about 10,000 to 20,000 km. \nThese are typically inclined with respect to the equator as the LEOs are, and can \naddress users with small, hand-held UTs, but can see a much larger portion of the Earth \nat one time, so that only 10 or 12 of them are required to give nearly complete Earth \ncoverage. \n\nRF Spectrum: The RF carrier frequency affects the satellite and ground station \nttansmitter power, antenna size and beamwidth, and requirements for satellite stabili-\nzation. In tum, these factors affect satellite size, mass, and complexity. The carrier \nfrequency also determines the transmitter power needed to overcome rain attenuation \n(~Sec. 13.3). Finally, it is necessary to apply for and receive permission to use an \nasSigned frequency from a regulatory agency such as the International Telecommuni-\ncation Union, the Federal Communications Commission, or the Department of \nDefense's Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee, and every nation's regulatory \nagency. These agencies also allocate orbit slots for geostationary satellites (Chap. 21). \n\nData Rate: The data rate is proportional to the quantity of information per unit time \nttansferred between the satellite and ground station (see Sec. 13.2). The higher the data \nrate, the larger the transmitter power and antenna size required (Sec. 13.3). Processing \nthe sp~ce~-gen.erated data on board the satellite reduces the data rate without losing \nessentialmformation, but makes the satellite more complex (see Sec. 13.2). \n\nDuty Factor: The fraction of time needed for operation of a satellite link is the duty \nfactor, which is a function of the mission and the satellite orbit A low duty factor \n\n13.2 Data Rates 543 \n\nenables a single ground station to support more than one satellite (usually the case for \ntelemetry and command). Alternatively, several users may share a single satellite link \n(see Sec. 13.5). \n\nIn the case of LEOs used for cellular service, one gateway will typically have \nseveral antennas communicating simultaneously with several satellites; each of which \nmay be carrying 1,000 or more individual circuits. In this case, the ground station duty \nfactor will be nearly 100% as antennas switch from satellite to satellite; the UT use \nfactor will be quite small, however, as is the use of a telephone. \n\nLink Availobility: Link availability is the time the link is available to the user \ndivided by the total time that it theoretically could be available. It depends on equip-\nment reliability, use of redundant equipment, time required to repair equipment, ont-\nages caused by rain, and use of alternate links. Typical goals for link aVailability range \nfrom 0.99 to 0.9999, the latter value applying to commercial telephone networks. (See \nChap. 19 for a discussion of reliability.) \n\nLink Access Tune: The maximum allowable link access time, or time users have to \nwait before they get their link, depends on the mission. For example, we usually \ndemand access to a voice circuit in seconds. Meteorological data is needed in less than \nan hour to be useful in weather forecasting. On the other hand, X-ray data from a \nscientific satellite can be stored and transmitted later. Tracking, telemetry, and \ncommand links are often required in near real-time (a few seconds), especUIlly if a \nproblem requires an immediate response from the satellite-control operator. Link \naccess time depends strongly on orbit selection, which determines when a Satellite is \nin view of the ground station. Note that a real-time response is impossible for deep \nspace missions, because the radio propagation time is minutes or hours long. \n\nThreat: Various kinds of threats may influence system design. For military \napplications, choices of frequency, antenna, modulation, and link margin need to be \nevaluated for susceptibility to jamming. At the same time, a high-altitude nuclear \ndetonation can disturb the propagation of radio signals. A physical threat to the \nsatellite might dictate multiple satellites or a hardened design (see Chap. 8). A physical. \nthreat to a ground station might demand a data-relay satellite with crosslinks to allow \nthe ground station to be relocated in safe territory. \n\nThe FireSat sample mission uses low-altitude satellites with limited coverage. If a \nground station is near the forest area under surveillance, a store-and-forward or \ncrosslink architecture is not required. The communications architecture is then simply \na single satellite operating when in view of its ground station. A separate groumd \nstation is required for each major area under surveillance. \n\n13.2 Data Rates \n\nIn designing a communications architecture for space missions, we must ask: what \nis the information to be transferred over our communication links? How fast must the \ntransfer rate be? Keeping in mind that higher rates of data transmission mean higher \nsystem costs, we need to decide how we will transfer information to the user. \n\nSatellite links originally used analog modulation techniques to apply the data onto \nthe RF carrier for transmission over the link. Since 1980, however, most space-ground \ncommunication links use digital modulation. To implement a digital system, we must \nfIrst sample the amplitude of the analog signal at a rate equal to at least twice the high-\nest frequency in the signal spectrum,fm. In 1928 Nyquist\" showed that if we meet this \n\n\n\n544 Communications Architecture 13.2 \n\ncondition we can theoretically reconstruct the original analog signal from the samples \n(see Sklar [1988], Sec. 2.4). For example, the normal human voice has a frequency \nspectrum range of about 3.5 kHz. Thus, to reproduce it digitally, the sampling rate \nmust be at least 7,000 samples!sec. However, practical considerations, such as realiz-\nable filter limitations, suggest that the sampling frequency should be at least 2.2 times \nthe maximum input frequency [Sklar, 1988]: \n\nis?:. 2.2fm (13-1) \nUsing Eq. (13-1), our 3.5-kHz voice signal must be sampled at a rate of \n\n7.7 ksamples!s. In fact, the sampling rate of commercial digitized voice systems is \n8 ksamples!s. Another example is the sampling rate of the audio compact disc player \nwhich is 44.1 ksamples/s-about 2.2 times 20 kHz, the maximum source frequency of \ninterest for high-quality music. \n\nThe analog amplitude sample is next converted to a digitized word composed of a \nseries of bits. Consider the analog-to-digital convener process illustrated in Fig. 13-4, \nwhere three bits designate one of eight amplitude levels. For example, a 6.3 V ampli-\ntude converts to a 3-bit wor~110. At the receiver, a digital-to-analog converter \nconverts this word according to the algorithm 22 + 21 + ()O + 0.5 = 6.5 V, leaving a \nquantization error of 0.2 V. This quantization error can be reduced by increasing the \nnumber of bits in the word. \n\n8 \n111 \n\n7 \n110 \n\nc 6 \ngil. 101 \n~! i 5 P 100 0 a,;; ~4 !! 011 ! -0 \n!- 03 \",0 \n6 010 \n\n2 \n001 \n\n000 \n\n0 \n~ \n\n~ \n/ \n\n~ \nr \n\n~ ~ \n~ ~~ \n\n~ t \n\n2345678 \n\nInput Voltage \n\n+ Quanllzallon \nt \n\nError for Input \nVoltage of 6.3 \n\nVpp \n\n1 \n\nAg. 13-4.

The signal-to-quantization noise power ratio is (M2 - I), which \nis approximately equal to M2 or 22n, ass~g a uniform distribution of the input \nsignal amplitudes over ~p. See Table 13-4. \n\nTABLE 13-4. Required Bits Per Sample.

For a gtven number of quantization levels, coarser quantization IS \napplied near the peak of large signals, where the larger absolute errors are tolerable \nbecause they are small compared to the larger signal amplitudes. These techniques are \ncommonly applied to voice transmission, where the speech waveform is compressed \nat the transmitter end prior to digitization, and expanded at the receiver. Taken \ntogether, the compressor and expander are called a com pandor. \n\nThe number of bits per sample is determined by the mission requirements. The Jet \nPropulsion Laboratory typically uses 256 shades of gray (i.e., n = 8) in differentiating \nvoltages from its imaging sensors, and 32 (n = 5) is normally used for low-definition, \nblack-and-white TV transmission. The length of the digital word selected depends on \nthe precision one requires for the application. For example, we do not need this preci-\nsion for satellite equipment temperatures, whereas scientific measurement may require \na highly precise data link, if justified by the sensor accuracy. \n\nThe data rate is the number of samples per second times the bits per sample, or the \nnumber of bits per second, abbreviated bps. Thus a digitized voice circuit in a com-\nmercial telephone network requires 8 ksamples/s times 8 bits/sample for a\u00b7data rate of \n64 kbps. Table 13-5 lists other examples. \n\nThe cellular-satellite systems are using methods for modulation, demodulation, and \nforward error correction that greatly reduce the data rates needed for transmission. For \nexample, the Globalstar system uses code division multiple access with Reed-\nSolomon coding for forward error correction and Viterbi decoding. It sends voice \nthrough a variable-rate encoder/decoder at an average rate of 9.6 kb/s, and can reduce \nto a 4.8, 2.4 or 1.2 kb/s rate under stress. These rates are much less than those discussed \nabove, and in Table 13-5, and represent new methods of coding digital data. With these \n\n\u2022 In dB, the signal-to-quantization noise ratio is 6n. See Sec. 13.3 for the definition of dB. \n\n\n\nw~ \nI \n\n: , , \n\n. \n\n------------- --- --------\n\nCommunications Architecture 13,2 \n\nTABLE 13-5.

Frrst, digital signals can more precisely transmit the data because they are less \nsusceptible to distortion and interference. Second, digital signals can be easily \nregenerated so that noise and disturbances do not accumulate in transmission through \ncommunication relays. Third, digital links can have extremely low error rates and high \n~delity through error detection and correction. Also, multiple streams of digital \nSignalS can be easily multiplexed as a single serial-bit stream onto a single RF carrier. \nOther ~d~antages are easier communic~tion-l~ security and implementation by drift-\nfree lD1D1ature, low-power hardware, mcluding microprocessors, digital switching \nand larg~ sc~e integrated circuit chips; In this chapter we will consider only digitai \ncommumcations. \n\nUsing the form~as developed in Chap. 5, we can easily determine the relationship \nbetween the quantity of data, D, the data rate, R, and the parameters for a single ground \nstation pass from Sec. 5.3.1. Specifically, \n\nD = R(FTmJU - Tinitiote ) I M (13-2) \n\nF = (11 AmJU) acos( COSAmJU I cos Amin) (13-3) \nwhere T max is the maximum time in view (i.e., the pass duration when the satellite \npasses directly overhead) from Eq. (5-52), Fis the fractional reduction in viewing time \ndue !D passing at an Earth central angle 'J..\",m away from the ground station, Amm: is the \nmBXlmum Earth central angle from Eq. (5-36), T initioJe is the time required to initiate \na communica~ons pass, ~d M is ~ margin needed to account for missed passes due \nto gro~d station down time, sharmg of groundtesources, transmission of other data, \nor conflicts on board the satellite or within the communications process. A reasonable \nvalue for T initioJe is about 2 minutes. M is conservatively estimated at a value of 2 to 3 \nunless it is a dedicated ground station with a specified value for the percentage of pass \n\n13.2 Data Rates 547 \n\ntime that will be used for collecting data. For the fraction of time in view, we may wish \nto use mean values rather than one for a specific ground station pass in Eq. (13-3). As \ndiscussed in Sec. 5.3.1, the average value of F is about 80% for satellites in a circular \nlow-Earth orbit, and 86% or more of all passes will have F greater than 0.5. \n\nWith this background on digital techniques, we now consider the data rate require-\nments for the three types of architectures discussed in the previous section: telemetry, \ntracking, and command (Tf &C); data collection; and data relay. \n\n13.2.11T&C \nThe number and accuracy of functions being monitored in the satellite determines \n\nthe telemetry data rate. Several hundred functions such as voltages, temperatures, and \naccelerations may require monitoring to determine if all satellite subsystems are \noperating correctly, and, ifnot, to determine where a failure occurred. Sampling each \ntelemetry sensor in sequence with a multiplexer combines all telemetry data into a \nsingle bit stream. The sampling rate is usually low, perhaps once every second or once \nevery 10 sec, because the monitored parameters vary slowly. For example, sup~se we \nwant to monitor 50 temperature sensors and 50 voltages once every 10 sec With an \naccuracy of 1.5%. The data rate required is 100 samples per 10 sec times 5 bits per \nsample, or 50 bps. Some applications require precise time or amplitude resolution of \nthe data. In these cases, the data may be transmitted in analog form by frequency mod-\nulation of one or more subcarriers [Morgan and Gordon, 1989]. \n\nThe rate needed to transmit commands to a satellite is usually quite low--perhaps \nonly one per second. A command message may be 48 to 64 bits long, consisting of a \nsynchronizing preamble (a set series of bits ), an address word that routes the command \nto its satellite destination, the command itself (often a single on-off digit), and some \nerror detection bits to make sure the command was correctly receiVed. Some com-\nmands can cause irreversible functions or damage the satellite if performed at the \nwrong time. These commands are usually first transmitted and stored in the satellite. \nCorrect reception by the satellite is verified by telemetry, after which a second com-\nmand is transmitted to execute the function. If the command is to be executed later \nwhen the satellite is out of the ground station's view, a time of execution is added to \nthe command word and stored in the satellite. The command is executed later when \nthe time contained in the command word coincides with the satellite's clock time. \n\nTo track a satellite, the ground station measures range or range rate for computing \nand updating the orbit ephemeris. For example, the Air Force adds a one Mbps \npseudorandom (PH) code to the command link. The satellite command receiver \nextracts this code. It is then retransmitted as part of the telemetry downlink signal. The \nground station measures the arrival time of the code relative to its uplink transmission \ntime to determine the round-trip delay, from which the range is computed. NASA's. \nGoddard Range and Range Rate system operates the same way except it uses several \nharmonically related sinusoidal tones plus a pseudorandom code. InteIsat uses only \nfour ranging tones. \n\nIn most cases we would want to use an existing IT &C ground station network. \nTable 13-6 summarizes the key parameters offour networks (see Chaps. 11 and 15 for \nadditional details). The ratio of downlink-ta-uplink frequencies listed in the table \napplies when the satellite transmitter is phased-locked to the received uplink carrier. \nThis mode allows the Doppler frequency shift of the RF carrier to be accurately \nmeasured at the ground station to determine the range rate. The United States has \nNASA's Deep Space Network and the Air Force's Satellite Control Network. Intelsat \n\n\n\n548 Communications Architecture 13,2 \n\n~d ?ther communications satellite operators use their own IT &C system, which \nehmmates ~e need to I?ay for the services of a larger network:.

The orbit of the user satellite must be below synchronous altitude to be in vie~ \nof the TDRS antennas. \n\n13.2.2 Data Collection \n\nIn the second .type o~ network! a satellite sensor, such as an optical or radar scanner, \ncollects data. This ~ta IS tranSDlltted to the ground station for processing and viewing \nby the user. !he pictures of global cloud cover on the evening television news come \nfrom a sate!llte sensor. Although we could include the sensor data as part of the telem-\netry data discuss~ above, we usually consider the sensor data separately when the \nsensor data rate IS greater than 100 kbps or so. Data rate requirements for payload \nsensors are discussed in Sec. 9.5.5. \n. Table 13:7 lists the data rates for two satellite-sensor configurations. One example \nIS. a geostation~ satellite with a radiometer which scans the entire Earth in 20 min \nW1~ 1 km resolution. Here the data rate is 1.42 Mbps, similar to a meteorological sat-\nelhte such as GOES. \n\nOn the other hand, using Eq. (9-23), we Calculate the FIreSatdata rate to be \n85 Mbps-too high for any practical, cost-effective system. Let us review the Fire-\nSat ~ssio? requirements. FIrst, we need to scan 150,000 acres (about 25 km by 25 \nkm) In 4 mm wi~ 30 m resolution. B! limiting the sensor coverage to the 150,OOO-acre \narea under surveillance as the satellite passes overhead, the sensor output rate would \nbe only 2,900 pixels per second, * for a data rate of 39 kbps (for 1.6 samples per \n\n13.2 Data Rates 549 \n\npixel, 8 bits per sample and q = 0.95). This rate is far more attractive for practical \ndesigns. We could also use some form of data processing on board the satellite, as \ndiscussed below. \n\nTABLE 13-7. Data RequIrement for rwo Example Sensor-Satellite Systems. For RreSat the \nsatellite ground track velocity provides scanning of the ground. \n\nParameter RreSat GeostatIonary \n\nh = Orbit altitude (km) 700 35,786 \nv = Ground track velocity (mls) 6,800 0 \nd = Ground resolution (m) 30 1.000 \nSw = Scan width (krn) 2,700 Earth coverage \nw = Scan width (deg) 57.9 18 \nz = In-track scan (deg) Continuous 18 \nT = Scan time 145 jLS/scan width 20 minlEarth image \ns = Number samples/pixel 1.6 1.6 \nn = Number bits/sample 8 8 \nq = Frame efficiency 0.95 0.95 \nR = Date rate - bps 85 x1()6 1.42 x1()6 \n\nIn many cases we do not need all data collected by the satellite's sensor. For \nexample, our FireSat data is of no interest unless the sensor observes heat from a forest \nfire. Onboard data processing can be used to dramatically reduce the required data \nrates. For FireSat, onboard processing would consist of selecting and transmitting only \nthose pixels receiving thermal energy above a specified temperature. The amount of \ndata-rate reduction depends on the portion of the observed area that is burning. We \nmust also insert extra bits to identify the position of the pixels or groups of pixels in \nthe scan. Such data processing can reduce the data rate by a factor of 3 to 10 or more, \ndepending on the nature of the data. \n\nAnother technique for reducing the data rate is to transmit only the changes in the \namplitude of the data samples. For example, the amplitude of the first pixel in a frame \nof data could be transmitted by an 8-bit word. Changes in amplitude of subsequent \npixels, relative to the previous pixel amplitude, are then transmitted as 3-bit words, \nthus reducing the data rate by 3/8. \n\nConsiderable effort has gone into reducing, or compressing, the data rate of a digi-\ntized voice channel [O'Shaughnessy, 1987]. One technique is Adaptive Differential \nPulse Code Modulation, which transmits the difference between the actual voice \nsample and a predicted value based on several previous samples. Data rates have been \nreduced from 64 to 32 or 16 kbps using these techniques while maintaining commer-\ncial toll-quality voice. Even greater reduction in data rates have been achieved with \nVocoders and Linear Predictive Coders. With this method, receivers use transmitted \nspectraI or excitation parameters to control a voice synthesizer. It requires a data rate \nof only 600 bps to 2,400 bps, but the voice often sounds unnatural. Voice-excited \nvocoders combine the best features of the approaches described above, producing a \nreasonably natural-sounding voice channel with a data rate of 4,800 or 9,600 bps \n[Gerson, 1990]. \n\n\u2022 Th al uI' .

(Data \nprocessing or compression uses VLSI circuits, which add little to satellite mass.) \nInstead of reducing the satellite mass, the ground stations cali be made smaller with \nincreased mobility and lower cost. A lower rate link can also better survive jamming. \nHowever, a compressed signal is less tolerant to bit errors, thus negating some of the \nadvantages listed above. We expect increased use of data compression in the future as \nperformance improves and cost decreases. \n\n13.2.3 Data Relay \n\nMost communications satellites and data-relay satellites simply retransmit the data \nreceived through a receiver-transmitter combination called a transponder. The total \nbandwidth capacities of three communication satellites are in Table 13-8. (See \nTable 13-6 for the TDRS capacities.) Transponder bandwidths of commercial geosta-\ntionary communication satellites are usually 36 MHz or 72 MHz. (These transponders \nare repeaters. See Sec. 13.5 for a description of the processing transponder. \n\nTABLE 13-8. Relay Bandwidth Capabilities of Representative CommunIcation Satell\"es. \nThe maximum data rate can be several times the bandwidth, depending on the \nmodulation and ground station size. The first entry for Intelsat-V.is read as 4 \ntransponders at 36 MHz and 1 transponder at 41 MHz. The total relay bandwidth \nIs calculated by multiplying the number of transponders by their bandwidth and \nadding them together. . \n\nTransponder Total Relay \nBandwidth Number Bandwidth \n\nSatellite Band (MHz) Transponders (MHz) \nIntelsat-V C 36/41 411 2,137 \n\n72177 1214 \nKu 72177 212 \n\n241 2 \nDSCS-111 X 50 1 375 \n\n60 4 \n85 1 \n\nGlobalstar L,S,C 16.5 16 264 \nGeneric Intemet Ka 100-1,000 20 4,000 \n\nThe cellular satellites have much different bandwidths. For example, Globalstar has \n16.5 MHz transponder channels to accommodate 13 of the CDMA 1.23 MHz chan-\nnels. The wideband Internet relay satellites proposed at Ka-band may have \ntransponders with 1 GHz bandwidths, to accommodate multiple 155 Mbps channels \nfor trunking Internet data between computers. The satellite communication world is \nbecoming much more complex. \n\n13.3 Link Design \n\nThe overall process of link design and, subsequently, payload sizing, is summa-\nrized in Table 13-9 and described in detail in this and the next section. The process for \ndeveloping the communications architecture and determining the link requirements \nwas detailed in Table 13-1. \n\nTo understand link design, we need to derme the relationship between data rate. \nantenna size. propagation path length. and transmitter power.

The power is relatively independent of carrier frequency \nbetween 200 MHz and 20 GHz In the absence of rain and antenna-pointing error at \nthe ground station. \n\n13.3.1 Derivation of Link Equation \n\nConsider a transmitter located at the center of a sphere of radius S, radiating power \nPL1 isotropically, and thus unifonnIy illuminating the surface of the sphere. The power \nflux density, Wf, received on the sphere's surface is the radiated power divided by the \narea of the sphere, that is, PL[141tS2. The radiated power is the transmitter power, \nP, reduced by the line loss, L[, between the transmitter and the antenna. \n\nIf the transmitting antenna has a narrow beamwidth, the power flux density is \nincreased by the transmitting antenna gain, G\" defined as the ratio of power radiated \nto the center of the coverage area to the power radiated by an isotropic (omni-\ndirectional) antenna. The received flux density is reduced by the transmission path \nloss, La, which includes atmospheric and rain absorption. The power flux density then \nbecomes: \n\n(13-5) \n\nwhere Wf is typicaIIy expressed in W/m2\u2022 PLP, is called the effective isotropic \nradiated power, or EIRP, in watts. In Fig. 13-6, the same EIRP and received power \nflux density is produced two ways, one using a high-power transmitter, the other a \nlow-power transmitter. The difference between them is that the approach using a \nlow-power. high-gain antenna illuminates only a limited coverage area. which mayor \nmay not meet the mission requirements. \n\n13.3 \n\nRg.13-6. \n\nLiDkDesign \n\nTransmitter \n\nElRP= 25 x 0.8 x 5 = 100 \n\nReceive \nAntenna \nArea, A \n\n553 \n\nTrade-off between Antenna Gain and Transmmer Power.

(13-4) we obtain \n\n(13-8) \n\nwhere C is the received power and (A./41tS)2 is defined as the space loss, Ls. \nIn digital communications, the received energy per bit, Eb , is equal to the received \n\npOwer times the bit duration, or \n\n(13-9) \n\nwhere C is in W, R is the data rate in bps, and Eb is in W\u00b7s or J. \nThe noise power at the receiver input usually has a uniform noise spectral density, \n\nNo, in the frequency band containing the signal. The total received noise power, N, is \nthen N,JJ, where B is the receiver noise bandwidth. (B is determined by the data rate \nand the choice of modulation and coding, as discussed later in this chapter.) No and N \nare related to the system noise temperature, Ta, by: \n\nand \n\n(13-10) \n\n(13-11) \n\n(13-12) \n\nwhere No is in WIHz, N is in W, k is Boltzmann's constant = 1.380 x 10-23 JrK, Ta is \nin K. and B is in Hz. By combining Eqs. (13-9) and (13-10) with Eq. (13-8), we obtain \nour original link equation, Eq. (13-4). \n\n13.3.2 Link Design Equations \n\nThe link equation is a product of successive terms and, therefore, can be conve-\nniently expressed in terms of decibels or dB. A number expressed in dB is just 10 loglo \nof the number. Thus, a factor of 1,000 is 30 dB and a factor of 05 is -3 db. If the \nnumber has units, they are attached to the dB notation. For example, 100 W is 20 dBW. \nAntenna gain is the ratio of radiated intensity in a specific direction to that of an \nisotropic antenna radiating uniformly in all directions and, therefore~ is a pure number \nwhich should, in principle, be expressed in dB. However, we use dBi (dB relative to \nisotropic) as the units for antenna gain to be consistent with standard practice in the \nindustry.\u00b7 \n\nEq. (13-4) can be rewritten in decibels as \n\nEi/No= P + L[ + Gt + Lpr + Ls + La + Gr + 228.6 -10 10g7; -10 logR (13-13) \n\nwhere EblNo. L[, Gt, LS' La~!-'p'''' and Grare in dB, P is in dBW, Tsis in K, R is in bps, \nand 10 log k =-228.6OdBW/(Hz\u00b7K). This can also be written as \n\nEi/No = EIRP + Lpr + Ls + La + Gr + 228.6 - 10 10gTs - 10 10gR (13-14) \n\n\u2022 Editor's Note: Of course, modem computers are fu)]y capable of mUltiplying real numbers \ninstead of adding logarithms. Uke much of astronautics, this peculiar nomenclature remains \nintact primarily to ensure the full employment of communications systems engineers. \n\n13.3 Link Design 555 \n\nwhere the EIRP is in dBW and sensitivity ?f the receiving stati~, ~rlTs = Gr -\n10 log Ts> is expressed in dBlK.

(13-9)]. Carrier power in W is the energy per bit in J times the \nnumber of bits per second. \n\nGINo == Ei/No + 10 log R \n\n= (EIRP) + Ls + La + G,.I1; + 228.6 \n(13-15a) \n\n(l3-ISh) \n\nFrom Eq. (13-12), the carrier-to-noise-ratio, GIN is GlNoB or, in dB, is c/No -\n10 log B. Combining this with Eq. (I3-15b): \n\nGIN = EIRP + Ls+ La + Gr + 228.6 - 10 10gTs -10 log B (13-16) \nwhere B is the noise bandwidth of the receiver in Hz. GIN also equals EblNo+ 10 \n\n10g(R/B). . ed 'fth . \nThe Received Isotropic Power, or RIP, is the power recelV 1 e receIve an~~a \n\ngain is 0 dB. If we substitute Gr = 1 (0 dB) i.Dto Eq. (13.-8), then C = RIP. Combmmg \nthis expression with Eq. (13-4), and converting to dB Yields: \n\nRIP = EblNo - Grl1's- 228.60 + 10 log R (13-17) \nwhere RIP is in dBW; A good way to specify the receiving system performance is to \nspecify the bit error rate (the probability a data bit is incorrectly. received) required !or \na given RIP. The designer then has the freedom to ~e off ?is demodulator. desIgn \n(which determines the Ebl No required to meet the specified bit ,:rror ~te) ag~st the \nantenna gain and noise temperature (G ITs) to meet the RIP SpecIfication at IDlmmurn \ncost. \n\nWe can similarly convert Eq. (13-7) to dB. Using the relationship! = ciA., where c \nis the velocity of light in free space <= 3 X 108 mis, we obtain the following equation \nfor the antenna gain, G, in dB: . \n\nG = 20 log 1t + 20 log D + 20 log! + 10 log 17 - 20 log c (13-18a) \n\nor \n\nG=-15959+2010gD+2010g!+ 10 log 17 (13-18b) \n\nwhere G is in dB,fis in Hz, and D is in m. \u2022. \u2022 \nFor a circular antenna beam the half-power beamWldth, 8, IS the angle across which \n\nthe gain is within 3 dB (50%) of the peak gain. We may estimate 8 from the following \nempirical relationship: \n\n8 = ~ (1 in degrees (13-19) \n!GHrP \n\nwhere !GHz is the carrier frequency in GHz, and D is the antenna diameter in m.\u00b7 \n\n\u2022 Equation (13-19) Yields a beamwidth about 20% greater than AID (Chap. 9). This accounts for \nthe nonuniform illumination of the parabola by the feed. . \n\n\n\nr 556 Communications Architecture 13.3 \nThe antenna gain is approximately 27,000102, obtained by combining Eqs. (13-7) \n\nand (13-19), and assuming 1/ = 0.55. A noncircular antenna has an elliptical beam with \nthe half-power beamwidth along the major axis equal to Ox and the half-power beam-\nwidth along the minor axis equal to By. The gain of the noncircular beam antenna can \nbe estimated: \n\n(13-20) \n\nwhere Ox and Oy are in deg, and G is in dBi. For example, an antenna with a 1 deg by \n2 deg elliptical beam has the same gain as a circular antenna with a beamwidth of \n1.4 deg. Gain calculated in this manner is generally accurate to within 25% (1.2 dB) \nfor beamwidths less than 150 deg. The beamwidths Ox or Oy can be estimated from \nEq. (13-19) with D equal to the major axis or minor axis diameters. \n\nThe above gain equations are for peak gain. However, a receive antenna might not \nbe located at the center of the transmitter antenna beam, or vice versa. With narrow \nbeamwidths, small errors in pointing the antenna (introduced by wind gusts on the \nground or satellite stabilization errors, for example) can lead to significantly reduced \ngain. The following equation estimates the reduction from peak gain, Le, in dB caused \nby a pointing offset from beam center: \n\nLe=-12 (e/0)2 (13-21) \nwhere Ois the antenna half-power beamwidth, and e is the pointing error. For example, \nfor e equal to 012, the pointing loss is 3 dB. In calculating a link budget, we would \nsubtract this pointing loss from the antenna gain. \n\nFrom Eq. (13-6) the space loss, Ls' is \n\nLs= ()\"14nS)2 = (c 141CSf)2 (13-22) \nConverting into dB, this gives: \n\nLs = 20 log (3 x lOS) - 20 log (4n) - 20 log S - 20 logf (13-23a) \n\n= 147.55 - 20 log S - 20 logf (13-23b) \nwhere S is the path length in m, andfis the frequency in Hz. \n\nThe system noise temperature, T S' is the sum of a number of individual contribu-\ntions from various sources. We have divided the noise sources into two groups. Those \noriginating ahead of the antenna aperture (e.g., in the atmosphere) we call the antenna \nnoise temperature, Tant\u2022 These noise sources are external to the ground station, except \nfor the antenna itself, and include: \n\n\u2022 Galactic noise \n\n\u2022 Noise radiated by clouds and rain in the propagation path \n\n\u2022 Solar noise (either in the antenna main beam or sidelobe) \n\u2022 Presence of the Earth (typically 290 K) in a sidelobe \n\u2022 Man-made noise (either in the antenna main beam or sidelobe) \n\n\u2022 Contribution of nearby objects, buildings, radomes, etc. \n\n\u2022 Temperature of blockage items in antenna subsystem such as booms or feeds \n\nFigure 13-7 shows the estimated noise temperature from various external sources \nas a function of frequency. Note the necessity of keeping the receive antenna from \npointing toward the Sun when the beamwidth is narrow \u00ab 5 deg).

The noise figure is often expressed in dB (that is, 10 log F). For \nexample, a cryogenically cooled receiver for reception of telemetry signals from a \nspace probe may have a noise figure of 1.1 (0.4 dB) for a noise temperature of 29 K. \n\n\n\n558 Communications Architecture . 13.3 \n\nAdding the antenna noise and receiver noise gives us the system noise temperature, \nTs.

Modulation is the process by which an input signal varies the characJeristics \nof a radio frequency carrier (usually a sine wave). These characteristics are amplitude, \nphase, frequency, and polarization. Demodulation of the signal at the receiver consists \nof measuring the variations in the characteristics of the received carrier and deducing \nwhat the original signal was. Amplitude modulation, though common in terrestrial \nservices, seldom appears in satellite systems because it requires larger (and more \ncostly) transmitters. Phase or frequency modulation techniques are preferred, because \nthe transmitter can operate at saturation for maximum power efficiency. \n\nFigure 13-8 shows the most common modulation techniques used in satellite \nsystems. Binary phase shift keying (BPSK) consists of setting the carrier phase at 0 deg \nto transmit a binary 0, and setting the phase at 180 deg to transmit a binary 1. Quad-\nriphased phase shift keying (QPSK), takes two bits at a time to define one of four \n\nLink Design 55!J \n\nsymbols. Each symbol corresponds to one of four carrier phases: 0 deg, 90 deg, \n180 deg, or 270 deg. Note that the symbol rate is one half the bit rate, thus reducing \nthe spectrum width by one half. \n\nTIme Function \n\n:: '1+1 ' I ' I ' I ' I ' I ' \nR \n\nBPSK AA AMAAA AAAJA. \n\nr\nVWI VIVlJ.,VWI V1VV, \n0\" 180\" 0\" 0\" 180\" 180\" \n\n\u2022 t \n\nQPSK +1w-AW-AttAtA+#A+lA+lAirt'A'r+'A'tf-A'rt-AI......-..... t V V V V v-V V V V \n90\" 0\" 180\" 1 \n(01) (00) (11) \n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAA \n8FSK V V V V 'Tv \\fvlJ V V V \\ \n\n~;~) \u00b71- (O~;--f \n\n\u2022 t \n\nFrequency Spectrum \n\n=\"'~-=-=-----. f OllR 2R \n2 \n\n\u2022 f \n\n-IRI- \u2022 f \n2\" \n\n12345878 \n\nRg. 13-8. Modulation Types Commonly Used for DlgHaI SIgnal TransmIssIon In SateDJte \nCommunJcatJons. R is the data rate. The shaded region is the required bandwidth. \n\nFrequency shift keying (FSK) sets the carrier frequency at FI to transmit a binary \n0, and at F2 to transmit a binary 1. The separation between F1 and F2 must be at least \nequal to the data rate to avoid performance loss from mutual interference. Thus, the \ntransmitted spectrum width is at least twice the width of the spectrum generated by \nBPSK. Multiple frequency shift keying (MFSK) sets the carrier frequency to one of M \nfrequencies. For example. for M = 8, the first three binary bits, 010, determine that the \ntransmitted frequency will be F5. The next three bits, 011. set the frequency at F6. The \nsymbol rate is one-third the bit rate, and the transmitted spectrum width is about 8/3 \nthe bit rate, where the separation between frequencies is the symbol rate. Less common \nspaceflight modulation schemes include minimum-shift-keying (MSK), offset-QPSK \n(OQPSK), 8PSK [Sklar, 1988), and BPSKIPM [yuen, 1983). \n\n\n\n560 Communications Architecture 13.3 \n\nThese modulation techniques have different spectrum widths, and thus require \ndifferent RF channel bandwidths, as illustrated in Fig. 13-8. An actual system may \nrequire wider bandwidths as a result of a tradeo!fbetween performance and fil~ com-\nplexity. For example, the FLTSATCOM Expenme~tal Package uses 8FSK ~ Its ~_ \nulation technique, with the tone frequency separation and total spectrum WIdth twice \nas large as that shown in the figure to make the filters less compl~x [McElroy, 1.988]. \n\nTo demodulate a digital bit reliably, the amount of energy receiVed for that bl~ Eb , \nmust exceed the noise spectral density, No, by a specified amount. Communication \ntheory derives the EblNo needed to achieve a req~ bit e\"or ra:~, BER, ~ !he \nreceiver output (see Sklar [1988], Chap. 3). The BER gives the probability of recelVln? \nan erroneous bit. For example, a BER of 10-5 means that, on the average, only one bIt \nwill be in error for every lOS bits received. . . \n\nFSK- and MFSK-modulated signals are usually demodulated by measunng the \nreceived power at each of the possible frequencies, and selec!ing the .freq~ency with \nthe largest power as the one transmitted. An adv~ta~e of this technique IS th~t any \nvariations in carrier phase introduced by the tranSffil~Slon channel (such as ~ultipath) \nwill not greatly degrade the link performance. For ~s reason, these modulation ~ \nare often used in military communications satellites (MFSK) and command links \n(FSK modulation of a subcarrier). \n\nOn the other hand, demodulation of either BPSK and QPSK requires us to measure \nthe phase of the received carrier. Thus phase distortion caused ~y ~e ~smission \nchannel will significantly degrade perform~ce. ~e effect ?f this dlstortio.n can ~ \nreduced using Differential PSK (DPSK). This techmque reqUIres no change 10 .c~er \nphase when transmitting a binary 0, and a 180-~eg phas.e reve~ when ~sffil~ng.a \nbinilIY 1. At the receiver the phase Of the came~ receI~ed ~unng each ~It penod IS \ncompared with the phase received dunng ~e preVIO~ bIt period to de~[ffil~e whether \na phase change took place. This modulation technique overcomes distortion effects \nprovided the phase changes between successive bit periods are small \u00ab 20 deg for \n< 0.5 dB degradation). \n\nUnfortunately, both BPSK and QPSK modulation experience sudden phase tran~i\u00ad\ntions at the bit boundaries. These transitions generate sidebands outside the malO \nsignal spectrum which may interfere with an adjacent. ~uency channel..But if th~ \ncarrier phase is gradually moved from one phase position to the next dunng the bIt \nperiod (from 0 deg to 180 deg, for example), then the sideband power is greatly \nreduced. One version of this technique is Minimum Shift Keying (MSK) [Sklar, 1988, \nSec. 7.9.2). These bandwidth efficient modulation techniques are particularly useful in \ncommunications satellite systems with multiple channels closely spaced to fit the \navailable frequency spectrum. \n\nA modulation method that combines binary phase shift keying of a subcarrier with \nphase modulation of the carrier is BPSKlPM\u00b7 m~ulation. Many 'I! &C links use this \nmodulation because the carrier and data are tranSffiltted at frequencIes separated by the \nsubcarrier frequency, which is made much larger than the data rate. This separation \nallows easy acquisition and tracking of the carrier, thus providing an accurate range-\nrate measurement The disadvantages of this technique are additional power required \nfor the carrier and increased bandwidth (to approximately twice the subcarrier fre-\nquency). For example, the SGLS TT &C downlink uses a 1.024 MHz subcarrier BPSK \nmodulated by data rates up to 128 kbps. The subcarrier then phase modulates the \n\n\u2022 FrreSat will use this technique for the uplink. \n\n13.3 UnkDesign 561 \n\ncarrier. For a phase modulation of \u00b11.0 radian, the transmitter power is divided \nbetWeen the carrier (60%) and subcarrier (40%).

Bit Error Probability as a Function of EblN\".The theoretical performance limit \ncan be approached by use of error correction coding. \n\nFor the digital systems discussed in this chapter, the BER is used to evaIuate the \nperformance of the link. On the other hand, analog communication links are generally \nevaluated in tenns of the output signal-to-noise ratio, SIN. The SIN is a function of the \nCIN, the modulation type, and how the SIN is expressed. For example, the SIN of a \nfrequency modulated (FM) television signal depends on the modulation index and the \npre-emphasis plus weighting factors in addition to the C/N (see Morgan and Gordon \n[1989), Sec. 3.4.5). \n\nForward error correction coding significantly reduces the EblNo requirement, \nwhich in tum reduces the required transmitter power and antenna size, or increases \nlink margin. Extra bits, called parity bits, are inserted into the data stream at the \ntransmitter. These bits enable the receiver to detect and correct for a limited number \nof bit errors which might occur in transmission because of noise or interference. While \ncomplex, these techniques can be implemented at relatively low cost, using large scale \nintegrated circuits with small size and low power consumption. This type of coding \ndoes have some disadvantages. The extra error correction bits increase the bit rate, and . \nhence the transmission bandwidth, often a scarce resource. Also, a low EblNo makes \ninitial signal acquisition more difficult \n\nA common type of error correction technique is convolutional coding with Viterbi \ndecoding [Viterbi, 1967; Sklar, 1988]. A rate-ll2 convolutional code is implemented \nby generating and transmitting two bits for each data bit The data rate is therefore one-\nhalf the transmitted bit rate (hence ''rate-II2''). The receiver demodulates and stores in \n\n\n\n562 Communications Architecture 13.3 \n\nTABLE 13-11. A Comparison of Several Modulation and Coding Schemes Used In Sat. \nelllte Communication Systems.

As time goeS on, additional bits are \nreceived and stored. These sequences are compared with coded sequences which could \nhave been transmitted. The possible sequence which most closely resembles the \nreceived sequence is chosen as the most likely sequence transmitted. This process is \nrepeated a number of times to reduce the probability of error. As shown in Fig_ 13-9, \nViterbi decoding greatly reduces the EVNo required to obtain a specified BER. For \nexample, a BER of 10-5 is achieved with an EblNo of 4.4 dB. This represents an \nimprove~ent, or coding gain, of 5.2 dB below the 9.6 dB required for uncoded BPSK. \n\nThere is a value of EVNo equal to -1.6 dB, known as the Shannon limit, below \nwhich no error-free communication at any information mte can take place. This is \nderived from the Shannon-Hartley theorem, which states that the maximum theoreti-\ncal data mte, RI'fUlX' which can be transmitted over a transmission channel with band-\nwidth, B, is \n\n13.3 Link Design 563 \n\n(13-26) \n\nwhere CIN is the avemge carrier-ta-noise power mtio in the channel (see Panter \n[1965], Sec. 19.2; or Sklar [1988], Sec. 7.4). \n\nWe cannot reach the Shannon limit in pmctice because the transmission bandwidth \nand coding complexity increases without bound. But we can apprc:>ach this limit by \nusing a double, or concatenated, coding scheme. The Pioneer deep-space communica-\ntion link uses this technique to obtain the performance required to overcome the large \nspace loss [Yuen, 1983, Sec. 5.4.4]. The binary signal is first block encoded using a \n255-bit Reed-Solomon code with 32 parity bits. The block-encoded signal is then \nencoded using the mte-l12 convolutional code. The data is recovered at the receiver \nwith a Viterbi decoder followed by a Reed-Solomon decoder. As shown in Fig. 13-9, \nthe BER performance for the concatenated code is only 4.2 dB above the Shannon \nlimit at a BER ono-5\u2022 Longer and more complex codes can be used to push perfor-\nmance even closer to the Shannon limit This technique is not presently used for data \nrates much above 100 bps due to the complexity and cost of the decoding process. \nHowever, we expect this limitation to disappear in the future with the development of \nhigh-speed, low-cost digital processing circuits. \n\nFigure 13-9 demonstmtes that the BER is sensitive to the EblNo level. At error rates \nbelow 10-4, a decrease of 1 dB in EblNo will increase the BER about one order of \nmagnitude. Thus, providing adequate link margin in our design (discussed later) is \nvery important. Note that the EblNo values given are theoretical, based on infinite \nbandwidth transmission channels and ideal receivers. In pmctice, we must account for \nband-limiting effects, deviations from ideal filter responses, phase noise and fre-\nquency drift in local oscillators, noise in carrier tmcking loops, and bit synchronizing \nerrors. Thus, we must add 1 or 2 dB to the theoretical EblNo to aIIow for these losses. \n\nChoosing which modulation and coding technique to use depends on cost, \ncomplexity, difficulty of acquiring the signal, limits on transmission bandwidth, and \nsusceptibility to interference or fading. In the case of power-limited systems, where \npower is scarce but bandwidth is available, coding makes sense_ Most systems today \nuse some forward error correction coding to save transmitter power unless the data rate \nis greater than several hundred Mbps, in which case limits on both bandwidth and \nhardware speed become significant. . \n\nTable 13-11 showed that to obtain a low value of EblNo for a BER of 10-5, we must \n!>e less efficient in using the spectrum, which means the transmission bandwidth must \n\n. increase. This is the result of adding forward error correction check bits to the signal \nbefore modulation, thus increasing the transmission mte through the channel. How-\never, recent techniques can achieve significant coding gains without increasing the \nbandwidth [Ungerboeck, 1982; Sklar, 1988, Sec. 7.10.6]. The basic idea is to combine \nthe coding and modulation process to genemte a set of possible coded signal patterns \nat RF, each pattern corresponding to an n-bit word. The receiver knows the set of pos-\nsible patterns and chooses the pattern that most closely resembles what it receives. For \nexample. a four-state, rate-2/3, encoder combined with 8PSK modulation achieves a \n3 dB coding gain over uncoded QPSK modulation with the same bandwidth. (8PSK is \nlike QPSK except the carrier phase is set at one of 8 possible phases separated by \n45-deg intervals.) Such schemes have been proposed for high-speed data communica-\ntion on satellite channels and are likely to be used in future space systems [Deng and \nCostello. 1989]. \n\n\n\nI : 564 Communications Architecture 13.3 \n13.3.4 Atmospheric and Rain Attenuation \n\nThe transmission path loss caused by the Earth's atmosphere, La' is a function of \nfrequency as shown in Fig. 13-10. This figure gives the attenuation at 9O-deg eleva-\ntion, that is, zenith. To detennine the loss at elevation angles,ft, above 5 deg, divide \nthe zenith attenuation by sinft. At frequencies below 1,000 MHz, ionospheric scintil-\nlation can cause significant fluctuations in received amplitude and phase. These effects \nare most severe at frequencies below 200 MHz during periods of high sunspot activity, \nwhen they can disrupt communications (see Ippolito [1986], Chap. 8). Above 50 GHz, \nhigh attenuation occurs at frequencies corresponding to the oxygen absorption band. \nVirtually all Earth-space communications use frequencies between these two \nextremes, though some projects have considered the 90-GHz band. Of special note is \nthe high absorption band of oxygen at 60 GHz. Intersatellite links often operate at \n60 GHz, using the atmosphere to shield from interference or jamming originating on \nthe Earth's surface. \n\ni' \n~ 102 \nc o \n; \n'\" i 101 \n~ \n;s \nc \n~ ,.. \n:; .. \nc \no \niii \no \n\n! g \n.c .... \n\n10-1 \n\n10-2 \n\nOkm \n4 \n\n8 \n\n12 \n\n16 \n\n2 5 10 20 50 \n\nFrequency (GHz) \n\n100 200 400 \n\nAg.13-10.

This figure comes from the Crane model-a \nset of tables and equations based on observed climatic data used to estimate the rain \nattenuation (see Crane [1980], or Ippolito [1986]). This attenuation becomes an \nimportant consideration when designing systems employing satellite-Earth link \nfrequencies above 10 GHz. Figure 13-'11 also shows that the attenuation increases \nrapidly as the antenna elevation angle decreases below 20 deg. When operating at \nfrequencies above 20 GHz, the minimum elevation angle to the satellite should be \nspecified at 20 deg, especially in high rainfall areas. Note, however, that increasing the \nminimum elevation angle dramatically reduces the size of the satellite's coverage area \n(see Sees. 5.3 and 5.4). \n\n13.3 \n\n40 \n\n10 \n\nLink Design \n\nAvailabnlly \n__ 99.5% \n\n----98.0% \n\nElevation \nAngle 10\" \n\n565 \n\nAg.13-11. Rain Attenuation Predicted by Crane Model for Rain Climate Typical of the \nNorthern United States. Ground station altitude = 0 km, latitude = 40\u00b0. For other \ncases, see Ippolito [1986]. \n\nThe percentage of time the link is available depends on the margin ~hich the li~k \nhas in clear weather. A higher link availability demands a greater margIn. The avail-\nability numbers shown in Fig. 13-11 co~nd ~o th~ cli~te of ~ortheast~m United \nStates. The availability for a specified link margm WIll be higher In the Midwest and \nlower in the Southeast, compared to those shown in the figure. (Bear in mind that these \navailability numbers come from average weather conditions over many years; they do \nnot account for the possibility that this year the rainfall may be higher or lower than a \nnormal year.) .. \n\nA by-product of rain attenuation is an increase in antenna temperature, Ta, gIven by \n\nTa = (I - La)1'o (13-27) \n\nwhere L is the rain attenuation given as a power ratio, and 1'0 is the temperature of the . \nrain, us;ally assumed to be 290 K. The significan~e of thi~ ~oise ~ depends on \nthe system noise in clear weather. For example, I~ a recelVl~g s~stem. WIth a normal \nsystem temperature of727 K experienced 10 dB raID attenuation, I~ nOIse temperature \nwould increase to 988 K, increasing No by 1.3 dB. The decrease In C/No would then \nbe the sum of the rain attenuation (-10 dB) and the increased noise (-1.3 dB) totaling \n11.3 dB. \n\n13.3.5 Frequency Selection \n\nRegulatory constraints exist on the selectio? of fre~uency band, transmission band-\nwidth, and power flux density. For example, mtemational agreements have allocated \nfrequency bands for space communications, as listed.in ~able 13.-12.

The system \ndesigner must apply for and receive permission from the appropriate agency to operate \nat a specified frequency with the specified orbit and ground locations. This is often a \ntime-consuming procedure (see Chap. 21.1). For an excellent summary of this com-\nplex subject, see Morgan and Gordon [1989]. \n\nTABLE 13-12.

Especially significant are the antenna side-\nlobe levels and the dynamic range of powers over which the system must operate. For \nground-station antennas operating in the 4-6 GHz and 12-14 GHz bands, the FCC \nspecifies the maximum sidelobe gain as (32 - 25 log tP) dBi for 1 deg ~ tP ~ 48 deg; \notherwise -10 dBi for 48 deg ~ tP~ 180 deg, where dBi is dB relative to an isotropic \nradiator (0 dB gain) and tP is the angle in deg off the axis of the main antenna beam. \nAlso shown in Table 13-12 are the maximum allowed power flux densities radiated by \nthe satellite onto the Earth. These limitations, set by the ITU, are necessary to avoid \ninterference to existing terrestrial services, such as microwave relay links. \n\nTwo geostationary satellites in approximately the same orbit location servicing the \nsame ground area may share the same frequency band by: (1) separating adjacent \nsatellites by an angle (typically 2 deg), which is larger than the ground station's beam-\nwidth, and (2) polarizing transmitting and receiving carriers orthogonally, which \nallows two carriers to be received at the same frequency without significant mutual \ninterference. Right-hand and left-hand circular polarization are orthogonal, as are \nhorizontal and vertical linear polarization. Commercial systems use these frequency-\nsharing techniques extensively [Morgan and Gordon, 1989]. \n\n13.3 UnkDesign \n\n13.3.6 Link Budgets \n\nThe link: budget provides the designer with values of transmitter power and antenna \nains for the various links in the system.

Select carrier frequency, based on spectrum aVailability and FCC allocations. \n(Refer to Table 13-6 for TT&C, Table 13-12 for communication satellites.) \n\n2. Select the satellite transmitter power, based on satellite size and power limits. \n\n3. Estimate RF losses between transmitter and satellite antennas. (Usually \nbetween -1 and -3 dB.) \n\n4. Determine the required beamwidth for the satellite antenna, depending on the \nsatellite orbit, satellite stabilization, and ground covemge area (see Chap. 7). \n\n5. Estimate th~ maxi~um. antenna pointin~ offset angle, based on coverage \nangle, satellite stabll:tzation error, and stationkeeping accuracy. \n\n6. Calculate transmit antenna gain toward the ground station, using Eqs. (13-20) \nand (13-21). You might also want to' check the antenna diameter: using \nEq. (13-19), to see if it will fit on the satellite. ' \n\n7. Calculate space loss, using Eq. (13-23a). This is determined by satellite orbit \nand ground-station location. \n\n8. ~~~ propag~tion ab~tion loss due to the atmosphere using Fig. 13-10, \ndlvldmg the zeruth attenuation by. the sine of the. minimum elevation angle \n(e.g. 10 deg) from the ground station to the satellite. (Consider min attenua-\nti~n later.) I would also add a loss of 0.3 dB to account for polarization \nnnsmatch for large ground antennas. Using a mdome adds another 1 dB loss. \n\n9. Select the ground station antenna diameter and estimate pointing error. H \nautotmcking is used, let the pointing error be 10% of the beamwidth. Use \nEq. (13-21) to calculate the antenna beamwidth. \n\n10. Calculate the receive antenna gain toward the satellite. For FJreSat we used \nantenna efficiency, 11, of 0.55. \n\n11. Estimate the system noise temperature (in clear weather), using Table 13-10. \n\n12. Calculate Ei/Nofor the required data rate, using Eq. (13-14). \n\n13. Using Fig. 13-9, look up EVNo required to achieve desired BER for the \nselected modulation and coding technique. The downlink for FrreSat is modu-\nlated with BPSK and the uplink is BPSKIPM. See Table 13-11. \n\n14. Add 1 to 2 dB to the theoretical value given in Fig. 13-9 for implementation \nlosses. \n\n15. Calculate the link margin--the difference between the expected value of \nEVNocalculated and the required EVNo (including implementation loss). \n\n16. Estimate the degradation due to min, using Fig. 13-11 and Eq. (13-27). \n\n17. Adjust input parameters until the margin is at least 3 dB greater than the esti-\nrna.ted value for min degradation, depending on confidence in the parameter \nestimates. \n\nFor communications satellites to evaluate a complete communication link (ground-\nto-ground), you must do the downlink shown above, and also calculate the uplink and \ncombine their EVNos in order to evaluate the communication link. ' \n\nUnkDesign 569 \n\nThe downlink calculation described above provides the signal-to-noise at the \nground station based on the assumed pammeters for the downlink. In order to establish \nthe performance of a communication link Earth-to-Earth, it is necessary to do the same \ncalculation on the uplink from the ground station to the satellite. The overall link per-\nformance can then be predicted based on the design of the satellite communication \npayload. In a bent-pipe satellite, the signal-to-noise mtio established on the uplink is \nused as the \"signal\" input for the downlink, and a final signal-to-noise is calculated \nbased on the noise already on the signal plus the noise gained on the downlink. For a \nsignal processing payload (see Sec. 13.5.2), where signals are demodulated and re-\nmodulated on board the satellite, then the overall signal-to-noise performance is only \nthat of the downlink, because this is a \"pure\" signal genemted on the satellite. Many \nof the new data satellites, and some of the cellular telephone satellites, use onboard \n\nprocessingdi: \u00b7ta1links al\" ted\u00b7 fth . b' th fi' al When gt are ev ua m terms 0 err It error mte, e system or SIgn \nprocessing satellites gets more complicated, because there will be a certain bit error \nrate on the uplink which becomes the starting point for the downlink. The bit error mte \nwill never be better than the weakest link. For these systems, it is desirable to make the \nuplink very robust so that bit error mtes of 10-9 or 10-10 are achieved on the uplink, \nin order that, again, the downlink determines the overall performance. This is typical \nfor most satellite links, as the satellite is limited in the amount of transmit power, \nwhereas ground stations are relatively independent of that limitation, at least until \nfrequencies of 30 GHz and above are used, in which case the cost of the transmitters \nbecomes a limiting factor. Tmnsmit power, transmit antenna gain, receiver noise \nfigure, and receive antenna gain establish the maximum signal-to-noise that can be \nestablished on any link. \n\nMany of the data handling satellites discussed elsewhere in this chapter expect to \ndeliver 10-10 bit error mtes on the entire Earth-Earth link. This is being achieved by \nusing very powerful forward-error-correcting codes (see Sec. 13.3.3). Convolutional \ncoding and Viterbi decoding (rate 113, K = 7) allow 10-10 bit error mtes with E,/No \nof only 5 dB for many newer, commercial data satellites. \n\nThe question often asked is, \"How much margin is enough?\" Clearly, too much \nmargin is wasteful and costly, but not enough margin could occasionally lead to \nexcessive bit error rates. Intelsat carries a 4 to 5 dB margin for their C-Band links. At \nfrequencies above 10 GHz the margin should be 6 to 20 dB to accommodate atmo-\nspheric and min losses, the exact amount depending on the required link availability \nand the amount of minfall expected. \n\nThe order of the steps outlined above will depend on which pammeters are \nspecified. For example, one might start with link margin and solve for transmitter \npower. The uplink design is performed in the same way, except the receive antenna \nbeamwidth rnay depend on the Earth-coverage requirement mther than size or pointing \nlimitations. \n\nFigure 13-12 illustrates how the downlink design, using a geostationary satellite, \ncan vary with choice of carrier frequency. In this example, the satellite antenna's \nbeamwidth is fixed at 6 deg to illuniinate a specified Earth covemge area, and the \nground-station size is fixed at 0.5 m for ease of transport. As the frequency decreases, \nthe satellite antenna's diameter increases to maintain the specified beamwidth (and \ngain) until it reaches a maximum size (or mass) limit, which, in this example, is 2 m \nat 1.75 GHz. Reducing the frequency further requires more transmitter power to \ncompensate for the loss in antenna gain [see Eq. (13-18a\u00bb). On the other hand, going \n\n\n\nI ; \nI \nI \nI \n\n570 CoDimunications Architecture 13.4 \n\nto higher frequencies requires more transmitter power to compensate for increasing \nreceive antenna pointing loss and to provide a margin to operate through rain.

The satellite Is \nin a geostationary orbit and the ground terminal diameter Is fixed at 0.5 m. \n\nTable 13-13 shows we can satisfy the F1reSat mission with a 20-W transmitter \noperating at S-Band (2.2 GHz) with a broad-beam antenna covering the entire Earth. \nA higher-gain antenna requires continuous steering to point toward the ground station, \nmaking the satellite far more complex. The diameter of the ground station antenna is . \n5.3m. \n\n13.4 Sizing the Communications Payload \n\nWe now have determined the satellite transmitter power and' antenna aperture size \nrequired to support our links. These parameters have the greatest impact on satellite \nmass, and thus on the cost of the system. In this section we will describe these \ncomponents and estimate their mass. This process is summarized in Table 13-9 in \nSec. 133. \n\nUp to now we have considered only the parabolic reflector antenna, which is best \nsuited for applications where the peak gain is above 20 dB and beamwidth is less than \n15 deg. For lower-gain, wider-beam applications, we may prefer other types of \nantennas with lighter mass and simpler design, especially at frequencies below 1 GHz \n(see Table 13-14). For example, an Earth-coverage satellite antenna has a beamwidth \njust big enough to illuminate the Earth. At geosynchronous altitude, this beamwidth is \n\n----------------\n\n13.4 Sizing the Communications Payload 571 \n\nTABLE 13-14. Antenna Types for Satellite Systems.

TypIcal Satellite-Antenna RequIrements for Telemetry and Command Cov-\nerage. The sateDite Is spin-stabilized during transfer orbit, and 3-axis stabilized In \ngeostationary orbit [Lo and Lee, 1988]. \n\n18 deg. A simple hom antenna is often used at frequencies of 4 GHz or above (such as \nthe Intelsat V C-Band IT &C antenna). When the frequency is below about 2 GHz, the \nhelix often has lighter mass and is easier to mount on a satellite structure. Either a \n\n\n\nI \n\n572 Communications Architecture 13.4 \n\nsingle helix (FLTSATCOM UHF transmit). or quad-helix (lntelsat V L-Band) may be \nused. Table 13-14 compares these choices for an Earth-coverage antenna at \n400 MHz.Wider satellite antenna beamwidths are required during launch and insertion \ninto orbit because satellite maneuvers cause large variations in angle toward the \nground station. During transfer orbit the satellite is often spin-stabilized. thus requiring \na toroidal beam (omnidirectional in the plane perpendicular to the satellite spin axis) \nto provide continuous coverage. Figure 13-13 shows a typical antenna pattern. A \nbiconical hom can generate this beam if it is mounted on a maSt to avoid reflections \nfrom the satellite's body. The antenna gain is typically at least -3 dB \u00b135 deg from the \nspin axis. Once in orbit the satellite is stabilized toward Earth. A directional antenna. \nusually a simple conical hom, provides a gain of 9 dB or more over \u00b120 deg from the \nEarth vertical. As an example. the Intelsat V satellite combines the toroidal and \ndirectional (Eartb-coverage) beams at a single port connected to the command re-\nceiver. The telemetry transmitters switch to either beam. depending on the mission \nphase. \n\nHigh-gain antennas are required to support high data rates with low transmitter \npower. The basic antenna types used for this application. summarized in Table 13-15, \nare the reflector, lens, and phased array. The reflector is most desirable for satellites \nbecause of its low mass, low complexity and cost, and design maturity. The weight \nadvantage of a reflector over a lens or phased array is especially significant for larger \nantenna diameters (> 0.5 m). Offset feeds can also simplify the satellite structure. The \nsatellite structure contains the feed which is pointed at the reflector (lntelsat V. for \nexample). Furthermore, an offset feed minimizes aperture blockage and therefore \nreduces the sidelobe levels. \n\nIn some missions it is necessary to change the direction the antenna beam is \npointing. Steering the beam electronically is often preferred to mechanical methods, \nespecially if the beam direction must be changed rapidly. The beam of a reflector \nantenna can be steered by switching to an off-axis feed. However. conventional reflec-\ntor antennas have high losses when scanned off axis. A shaped secondary reflector can \ncompensate for these losses, but scan angles greater than about 10 deg are difficult to \nachieve. We can design lens antennas for good scanning performance, but their mass \nis generally larger than the reflector plus feed when the diameter exceeds about 0.5 m \nThe lens. or reflector antenna can perform beam scanning by switching between \nmultiple feed elements or by using a phased array as the feed. Switching between feed \nelements or varying the amplitude or phase of each element electronically controls the \nfeed. However, losses caused by the feed control (beam forming) network [L\n\n1 \nin \n\nEq. (13-4)] can degrade the scanning antenna's performance. \nA phased-array antenna may generate one or more beams simultaneously. forming \n\nthese beams by varying the phase or amplitude of each radiating element of the array. \nThis technique used for microwave radiometry is described in Chap. 9. We may also \nuse an adaptive array to automatically point a null toward a jamming signal source to \nreduce the jamming-ta-signal ratio. \n\nTo support high data rates with low satellite power, the antenna beamwidth should \nbe narrow. However, as illustrated in Fig. 13-14, a narrow beam may not give us \nenough coverage to establish links between several widely separated ground stations. \nThe DSCS ill solved this problem by using waveguide lens antennas with variable \nbeam-forming networks to generate a single beam with multiple lobes, each directed \ntoward a ground station. An alternate approach is to generate multiple beams. Milstar \nuses a lens with a switched-feed array. and AcrS uses a reflector with an offset \n\n13.4 Sizing the Communications Payload S73 \n\nLE 13-15 Six Antenna Configurations Used In Satellite Systems.

Beams shaped to IIIwnfnaIe specific land masses \n\nThe mass of a satellite antenna, including feed, depends largely on its size and the \nmaterials used in its construction. These factors are in turn a function of the frequency \nand beamwidth or gain. Table 13-16 lists some examples of satellite antenna weights, \nshowing that the more complex shaped-beam antennas have relatively high mass \nbecause of their complex feed networks. Multiple and scanning beam antennas have \ncomparable masses. \n\nThe power efficiency and mass of a satellite transmitter are often key factors in \nsizing a satellite. Figure 13-15 shows how the transmitter input power and mass varies \nwith output RF power, based on actual satellite equipment. We can see that the solid-\n\n13.5 Special Topics 57S \n\ntate tranSmitter has lower mass but requires more input power compared to the \n~veling wave tube amplifier. In general, solid-state transmitters are preferred for \npower outputs up to 5 or 10 W, except at frequencies below 2 GHz, where power \noutputs up to 80 W are achievable. Solid-state amplifiers are more reliable than the \ntraveling wave tube amplifi~, mo~y ~ause they require lower vol~ges ..

In such situations, it is cost effective to provide a means of sharing a lim-\nited amount of satellite link capacity between users. \n\nFigure 13-16 shows three basic techniques for sharing link capacity. Frequency \ndivision multiple access (FDMA) assigns a single carrier frequency for each input sig-\nnal. Bandpass filters at the receiver separate the individual carriers from each other. \nMost communications satellite systems use this technique with a repeater transponder \noperating in a linear (back-off) mode. The ground station is less expensive because the \ntransmitter peak power is lower than the TDMA ground station described below. \n\nTime division multiple access (1VMA) assigns a single time slot in each time frame \nto a single input channel. A digitized input signal is sampled and stored in buffer mem-\nory. These samples are then transmitted as short bursts within the assigned time slots. \nThe bit rate during the burst is high, therefore requiring a high peak transmitter power. \nAt the receiver the samples are sorted and stored, and then read out at the original rate. \nThese samples are then converted to an analog signal and smoothed to obtain a replica \nof the original input signal. Some systems, including Intelsat and DSCS-lli, use this \nmethod for some of their users. \n\nIf the satellite uses a multiple-beam antenna, a switching matrix on the satellite may \nbe used with TDMA to route each time slot burst to the desired downlink antenna \nbeam. The NASA ACfS [Naderi and Kelly, 1988] uses this technique, known as Sat-\nellite Switched-1VMA (SS-1VMA). In some applications, the uplink uses the FDMA \ntechnique, and the downlink uses the TDMA [McElroy, 1988]. This method requires \nonboard processing (demodulation and remodulation) of the signal in the satellite, as \ndiscussed below. \n\nA third technique, code division mUltiple access (CDMA), consists of phase-\nmodulating (BPSK or QPSK) a carrier with data, and then biphase-modulating the \ncarrier with a pseudorandom noise (PN) code. (See Fig. 13-17.) The data rate is much \nlower than the PN code, or chip rate. Thus there are many code bits (or chips) per data \nbit. The receiver has a code generator which replicates the PN code of the desired \nsignal on a carrier with frequency equal to the received carrier plus or minus an inter-\nmediate frequency (IF). \n\nThe PN codes are designed to have low cross-correlation properties (shown in \nFig. 13-17B) so that two or more signals can be transmitted simultaneously at the same \nfrequency with little mutual interference. Thus the received signals are essentially \nuncorrelated with the locally generated PN code and appear as noise to the receiver, \nexcept when identical received and locally-generated codes are aligned, or synchro-\nnized, in time. When this happens, the output of the mixer is a carrier containing only \nthe narrow-band data modulation, which passes through the IF bandpass filter (BPF) \n\n13.5 Special Topics 577 \n\nTechnique Time Frequency Advantages Disadvantages \n\n\u2022 Continuous \u2022 Multiple users Frequency \nPower carrier cannot share \n\n~ ~ \ntransmission. singletransmltter \n\n\u2022 Peakand wlthout mutual \naverage power' Interference or \nequal. low power \n\n\u2022 No complex efflclency.

Direct-Sequence Spread-Spectrum Technique Used In CDMA System. The \nnumbers in C and 0 above refer to the block diagram In A. \n\n13.5 Speclal Topics 579 \n\nAs shown in Fig. 13-17B. the power density of the PN-coded signal at center \nfrequency is proportional to liRe (Re = lito). where Re is the chip rate. The spectrum \nof the desired signal after despreading is proportional to lIR. where R is the data rate. \n'Thus the power density of the desired signal is increased. relative to the power density \nof an unspread interfering signal. by the ratio Re fR. This ratio is commonly referred \nto as the coding gain of the spread-spectrum system. \n\nNote that in order to receive the desired signal. the locally generated code must be \nidentical to the desired signal's code. and the two codes must be synchronized. We \nmay accomplish this synchronization by scanning the locally generated code in time \nuntil synchronization takes place. To reduce the time to synchronize. a short code may \nbe used for acquisition. such as the CIA signal in GPS. \n\n'The number of simultaneous users which the COMA system can handle is limited \nby the noise generated by the undesired user signals. Suppose all COMA user code \nrates and data rates are the same. and their carrier powers at the receiver input are \nequal. How many users can the system support? Eq. (13-28) estimates the maximum \nnumber of users. M, that the system can accommodate before the received energy-per-\nbit, E\"fNo. drops below threshold. \n\n(13-28) \n\nwhere C/No is the received carrier-to-noise-density ratio from one user (Eq. 13-15a). \nRc is the PN-code chip rate. R is.the data rate. and Re is much greater than R. Note that \nin Eq. (13-28) ClNo and E\"fNo are power ratios, not dB. \n\nAn example of a COMA system is the GPS navigation message on the CIA signal. \nEach satellite transmits a PN code with a different time phase. Re = 1.023 Mbps. \nR = 50 bps, Ei/No= 10 dB = 10, and C/No = 38.6 dB-Hz = 7,244 Hz. Substituting into \nEq. (13-28), we obtain M = 1,906 channels. This. of course. is much greater than the \nactual number of channels required for GPS (less than 28). \n\nRemember that M is the number of equal-power users. Suppose one user is received \nwith power 10 times greater than the other M-I users. If this is an undesired user, it \nwill generate interference equivalent to 10 undesired equal-powered users. thus reduc-\ning M by 9. For this reason an efficient COMA system often requires some automatic \nmeans of controlling the transmitter power of each user. \n\nThe COMA system is generally less bandwidth-efficient than FDMA or TDMA. \nOn the other hand, the COMA system is less suSceptible to interference, including \nmultipath caused by reflections from buildings or other objects. This makes COMA of \nspecial interest to satellite communication systems with mobile terminals. For more \ninformation on multiple access techniques. see Morgan and Gordon [1989], Chap. 4. \n\nCode division multiple access, COMA, is used by the Globalstar cellular telephone \nsatellite system in order to preserve spectrum. Each signal is 1.23 MHz wide. corre-\nsponding to the Cellular Telephone Industries Association Standard IS-95 for terres-\ntrial cellular telephones. Up to 128 different signals can be \"stacked\" on the same \nfrequency channel by virtue of being biphase modulated by different pseudorandom \nnoise codes, or Walsh codes, as discussed above. The receiver recovers the signal by \napplying the same code to the incoming signal. demodulating it If you divided this \nband by 64 kHz. the bandwidth of a typical digital telephone signal. you get only 19 \nsignals in the same bandwidth. In practice. the number of signals on a given channel \nis limited to 30 to 50 because of satellite transmit power limitations. \n\n\n\n580 Communications Architecture 13.s \n\n13.5.2 Payloads with Onboard Processing \n\nAs discussed previously, communication relay satellites usually employ a repeater \ntransponder (also called a non-regenerative repeater or \"bent pipe\"), which receives \nthe uplink signals from all of the user transmitters operating in the assigned uPlink \nfrequency band, shifts the frequency to the downlink band, amplifies, and retransmits. \nThis transponder is reliable and simple to use. But this technique has several disadvan-\ntages when more than one signal is received at the same time. FlfSt, the transponder's \ntransmitter must operate as a linear amplifier to reduce mutual interference Caused by \nintermodulation distortion. We must back off the input signals about 3 to 6 dB from \nmaximum, thus reducing the transmitter's power output to roughly one-half to one-\nfourth of the maximum saturated pOwer. We do so by controlling the transponder gain \nin the satellite (either automatically or by ground command), or by regulating each \nground station's transmitter power. Second, the strongest uplink signal will tend to \ncapture the satellite transmitter power, thus suppressing the weaker signals. This \nmakes the transponder particularly vulnerable to uplink jamming. . \n\nAn alternative to the repeater transponder is the onboard processing transponder \nor regenerative transponder. This transponder demodulates the received signal on \nboard the satellite, and then routes the signal to the appropriate downlink modula-\ntor/transmitter and antenna beam (see Fig. 13-18). An example of this architecture is \nthe Fleetsat Experimental Package developed for the Air Force by Lincoln Laboratory \n[McElroy, 1988J. The FDMA technique is selected for the uplink to allow use of low-\npower, ground-station transmitters as discussed above. The FDMA signals are \ndemodulated by the satellite transponder, and the messages are reformatted into a \nsingle downlink TDMA data stream. TDMA is selected over FDMA for the downlink \nto allow the satellite transmitter to operate at saturation for high power efficiency. \nWhile more complex, the processing transponder overcomes the disadvantages of the \nrepeater transponder. \n\nRepeater \nTransponder \n\nFig. 13-18. Two Payloads Commonly Used In CommunlcaUon-Satelllte Architectures. The \ndespreadlspreadlng capability Is used in military satellites to counter the effects of \njamming. \n\nA large number of 20130 GHz synchronous (except for Teledesfc) satellites were \nproposed to the FCC in August 1995. None has been licensed yet. They are listed in \nTable 13-18. Most of these satellites plan to use advanced onboard signal processing \ntransponders. This allows onboard rerouting of the data, and improvement of the over-\n\n13.5 Special Topics 581 \n\nall link performance because the noise of the uplink is not carried over to the downlink. \nMany of these proposals promised digital data transmission of the order of 10-10 bit \nrror rate with Ei/NoS on each link of the order of 5 dB. They used coding scheme such \n~ those discussed in Table 13-11 and the accompanying text in Sec. 13.3.3. \n\nTABLE 13-18. 20130 GHz FCC Proposals for Commercial Data Relay Satellites (Internet, \nTelephone Trunklng). \n\nr- Satellite Na.me Owner Satellite Name Owner \n\nNorsat Norwegian companies GEAmericom General Bectric \n\ntSpaceway Hughes Motorola Motorola \n\nI\":feledesic Teledeslc KaStar \n\nCyberstar Space SystemsILorai Pan Am Sat Pan Am SatJHughes \n\nAT&T AT&T Net Sat 28 Net Sat \n\nLockheed Martin Lockheed Martin MorningStar \n\nEchostar Cellular Vision \n\nNote: A total of 55 proposals have been med with the Intemational Telecommunlcatfons Union (ITU). \n\n13.5.3 Antijam Techniques \nBecause the satellite is usually in view of a large segment of Earth, RF interference \n\nfrom Earth-based transmitters, either unintentional or deliberate, may occur. The \nfrequency allocation procedures discussed previously minimize unintentional inter-\nference. Intentional interference, or jamming, is of particular concern in military \napplications. Jamming consists of transmitting a large modulated carrier to the receive \nterminal at approximately the same frequency, overwhelming the desired signal and \nthus disabling the link. \n\nWe can reduce the effects of jamming by using spread-spectrum modulation \ntechniques [Dixon, 1984J to spread the transmitted signal in a pseudorandom manner \nover a bandwidth much larger than the data rate. The receiver takes advantage of the \nfact that he knows the code used to modulate the transmission while the jammer does \nnot A replica of the pseudorandom waveform is generated at the receiver and corre-\nlated with the received signal to extract the data modulation. Using this method, we \ncan reduce the received jamming power relative to the desired signal by the ratio of \nthe spread-spectrum bandwidth to the unspread signal bandwidth. For example, by \nhopping a BPSK-modulated signal of 100 bps over 1 MHz, the jamming power, on the \naverage, is reduced by a factor of approximately 10,000, or 40 dB. \n\nIn a communication relay satellite, onboard processing is highly 4esirable to \ndespread the received signal before retransmitting it on the downlink. Otherwise the \nuplink jamming signal will capture most of the satellite transmitter's power, leaving \nlittle for the signal. Another technique for countering uplink jamming, employed by \nthe DSCS-ill, is to generate a null in the antenna beam pointed toward the jamming \nsource. This technique can lower the jamming power by 20 to 40 dB relative to the \npower of the received signal. \n\nThe satellite crosslink may also be jammed. The satellite can reject jammers located \non Earth by using narrow antenna beams pointed away from the Earth. Operating at \n60 GHz takes advantage of the oxygen absorption band, thus shielding the satellite \nfrom the Earth. Crosslinks may also use spread-spectrum and antenna-nulling \ntechniques. \n\n\n\nI \n\nr \n\n582 Communications Architecture 13.s \n\n13.5.4 Security \n\nA characteristic of space-ground communication is the ease with which the link can \nbe intercepted by an unauthorized user, who may receive the data for his own use, or, \neven worse, take control of the satellite by transmitting commands to it Data encryp-\ntion techniques help us avoid these problems by denying access to the data and the . \nsatellite command channel unless the user has the correct encryption key. Recent \ndevelopments have led to complete encryption and decryption devices being placed on \nsingle VLSI chips, thus adding little to satellite mass. The main issues are distributing \nthe key and synchronizing time. To make sure a link remains secure over the life of \nthe satellite, the encryption key must change at regular intervals, because others will \nmonitor and eventually uncover it \n\nThe receiver decryption device must be accurately synchronized with the transmit-\nter encryption device to recover the original data. With some systems, both the satellite \nand ground station may need a very accurate atomic clock, especially if the data rate \nis high and one must acquire the signal within seconds. For command links to station-\nary satellites, the data rate is low and the acquisition time can be long. For this \napplication, crystal oscillators are accurate enough. An alternative to atomic clocks is \na GPS receiver, which automatically synchronizes itself to the GPS time standard. \n\n13.5.5 Diversity Techniques \nDiversity techniques consist of transmitting or receiving the same signal more than \n\nonce to increase the probability of receiving the signal correctly. For example, a satel-\nlite may transmit a signal simultaneously to two ground stations. If the distance \nbetween these ground stations is greater than about 5 km, the probability of high rain-\nfall attenuation existing at both locations at the same time is small. This technique is \ncalled spatial diversity and is an effective way to increase the availability of a satellite-\nground station link operating at frequencies above 20 GHz, where rain attenuation can \nbe large [Ippolito, 1986]. \n\nA second example of diversity is to transmit the same signal two or more times at \ndifferent frequencies or time intervals. For example, multipath fading may be caused \nby reflections of the signal from parts of the aircraft structure in a satellite-ta-aircraft \nlink. The multiple reflected signals will interfere with the main signal, causing the \namplitude of the received signal to vary with frequency and time as the aircraft moves. \nUse of frequency or time diversity will increase the probability that the message will \nbe received correctly in at least one frequency or time interval. In military applications, \nfrequency hopping over one data symbol provides frequency diversity protection \nagainst partial band jllQlllling. Forward error correction coding followed by inter-\nleaving (e.g., scrambling the order in which the bits are transmitted) provides a form \nof time diversity protection against a pulse jammer. Time interleaving improves the \ndecoding performance by randomizing a burst of errors caused by pulse jamming. \n\nA third example of diversity is a technique used by Globalstar, \"satellite diversity.\" \nIn this case a ground station talks to a UT with circuits through two separate satellites. \nThis is not to avoid.rain outages as discussed above, but rather outages caused by \nblockage from buildings or trees for mobile UTs. If the path to one satellite is tempo-\nrarily interrupted, the power is increased on the other link to maintain the contact \nAlso, when one satellite is \"setting,\" this technique maintains the conversation through \nthe \"other\" satellite while a new ''rising'' satellite can begin to carry a circuit. In this \nway, handover between satellites is transparent This is accomplished by using a \nRAKE receiver. A RAKE receiver has the property of baving several parallel digital \n\n13.5 Special Topics \n\nprocessing channels whi~~ can ~rrect. for. Dopp~er frequency offset ~d time .delay so \nas to combine several digttal SIgnalS m time alignment for the maxunum SIgnal-to-\nnoise ratio. The technique requires two ground antennas, which are putting many \ncircuits through each satellite simultaneously. \n\n13.5.6 Optical Links \nIn recent years lasers generating narrow band energy at optical frequencies provide \n\nan attractive alternative to the microwave frequencies discussed above. Unfortunately, \nclouds and rain seriously attenuate optical links. Therefore, optical links have limited \napplication in satellite-Earth communic~tions. Howev~, an.optica1link is well ~uited \nfor communication between two satellites. Intersatellite links have been designed \nusing optical links with capacities above 300 Mbps. \n\nOptical crosslinks are superior to mi~wave cro~~ for ~gh data rates ~use \nthey can obtain extremely narrow beamWldths and high gams WIth reasonable SIZe (see \nFig. 13-19). Also, frequency allocation problems do not exist in the infrared or visual \nbands. On the other hand, the narrow optical beams are difficult to acquire and point \naccurately, requiring complex and sometimes heavy pointing mechanisms. \n\nFigure 13-20 compares RF and laser crosslinks, demonstrating that RF links are \ngenerally better for data rates less than about 100 Mbps because of their lower mass \nand power. However, development of more efficient lasers and lighter steerable optics \nmay soon make lower rate optical links attractive. \n\n10 \n\n..

The laser frequency of 6 x 1014 Hz was chosen for its ability to pen-\netrate sea water. Even so, the water loss can range from 5 to 50 dB or more, depending \nupon the actual depth of the submarine. In addition, loss due to cloud scattering is \n\n\n\n584 Communications Architecture 13.5 \n\n400 \n\n300 \n\ni \nl! 200 \n9 Heterodyne \n~ \n\nLaser (1 W) \n\n100 \n\n\u2022 LES819 \n(0.5 W @ 38 GHz) \n\n0 \n104 10 5 106 107 106 109 \n\nData Rate (bps) \n\nFig. 13-20.

These losses are overcome by using low data rates of 10 to 100 \nbps, advanced coding techniques, and high-gain, narrow-beam optics. \n\nCommercial satellites for both 2 GHz mobile satellite service and 38/49 GHz \ntrunking service have proposed use of optical intersatellite links between satellites for \nefficient data transmission. They promise the advantages cited above in Figs. 13-19 \nand 13-20. A listing of these proposals is in Table 13-19. \n\nTABLE 13-19.

NASA, the DoD, industry, and \nother organizations have different requirements for mission operations and each orga-\nnization has developed it's own philosophy and style for carrying out the mission. \n\nMission operations focuses on the period after launch, but substantial work must be \ndone during all phases of mission design and development to prepare for operations. \nFailing to take operations into account in preliminary mission design will significantly \nincrease both the cost and risk of the mission. \n\nWe must distinguish between the mission concept-how we conduct the overall \nmission and how the elements of the mission fit together (Chap. 1 ~d the mission \noperations concept-how we do operations to carry out the mission objectives. In this \nchapter we define 13 key functions performed by mission operations (see Fig. 14-1) \nand discuss how they combine to meet the mission operations concept. Hardware, soft-\nware, people and procedures operate together to complete these 13 functions. We must \ncarefully trade automation against ground crew operation~n the ground and in \nspace. Automating some of these functions can lead to lower operations costs and, in \nmost cases, lower life-cycIe costs. Organizations may group or name these functions \ndifferently, but we believe our list captures the tasks essential to mission operations. \n\nThe operations director must first define and negotiate the requirements on opera-\ntions; then try to influence them to reduce cost and complexity. With requirements and \nconstraints in place, the director must decide which functions to do, as well as their \nscope and how they can be done. Depending on the size and complexity of the mission, \na director may even have to add functions to the list. In addition, the director must \naddress organizational, hardware, and software interfaces between the functions. \n\n587 \n\n\n\n11 \nI\" 588 \n\n10 \ns \ny \nS \nT \nE \nM \n\nE \nN \nG \nI \nN \nE \nE \nR \nI \nN \nG \n\nI \nN \nT \nE \nG \nR \n\nData A \nT Processing I \n0 \nN \n\n& \n\nT \nE In s \nT \n\nMission Operations \n\nMANAGING MISSION OPERlillON \n\n7 \n\nPayload \nCps \n\nCOMPUTER & COMMUNICATION SUPPORT \n\n131 s \n0 \nF \n\n\u00b7r \nw \nA \nR \nE \n\nD \nE \nV \nE \nl \n0 \nP \nM \nE \nN \nT \n\n& \n\nM \nA \nI \nN \nT \nE \nN \nA \nN \nC \nE \n\n12 \n\nFig. 14-1. ~ 1.3 Functions of Mission Operations System and How they Interact. Func-\ntions In the shaded area share data within the mission database. We briefly discuss \nthe~ in Sec. 142. Functions 4, 8, and 9 are part of a broader category called data \nservrces. \n\nFigure 14-1 overviews a mission operations system that carries out the mission \noperations concept. This system processes infonnation and'controls the ground and \nspace assets so users and operators get needed infonnation and services. Most \nmissions today focus on providing infonnation to users or customers-the downlink. \nBut control drives much of the cost and complexity of operations-the uplink. We will \nsee this in the following sections. \n\nThere is a fund~ental differen~e in mindset between designers and operators of \nspace systems: DesIgners expect thI?~ to work; operators expect things to go wrong! \nBoth perspectives are necessary. MISSIon operators usually help develop the mission \nco~cept, but they often get involved too late-long after the initial design phase in \nwhich te~ can make co~t-effe<;tive .choices. Operators should get involved early \nenough !o ~fluence plannmg and d~Ign, so they can reduce the life-cycle costs of \nspace ~sslOns. They ~elp develop flIght rules, which govern operators' responses to \nanomalies and ensure timely responses consistent with mission success. \n\nFigure 14-1 shows 13 mission operation functions. We can combine or eliminate \nsome of them to reduce cost and complexity. Nine share data through the mission \ndatabase and the space element's avionics and they require extensive data processing: \n\n1. Mission planning-deciding what to do and when \n\n2. Activity planning and development--creating operational scenarios and devel-\noping command loads \n\n3. Mission control-managing daily activities \n\n589 \n\n4. Data transport and delivery-establishing communication links and managing \ndata flow \n\n5. Navigation and orbit control-detennining where the spacecraft is and plan-\nning maneuvers \n\n6. Spacecraft operations-managing the spacecraft bus \n\n7. Payload operations-managing the spacecraft's payload \n\n8. Data processing-managing the data flow on the spacecraft and on the ground \n\n9. Archiving and maintaining the mission database-managing all data generated \nby the mission \n\nThe order from upper left (mission planning) clockwise to lower left reflects the usual \norder in processing: analyzing uplinks, analyzing downlinks, and then planning new \nuplink activities. The other four functions provide support for all aspects of mission \noperations: \n\n10. Systems engineering, integration, and test-maintaining the mission operations \nconcept \n\n11. Computers and communications support-planning for and maintaining the \ninfrastructure \n\n12. Developing and maintaining software-spread throughout all functions \n\n13. Managing mission operations-maintaining the big-picttIre perspective, man-\naging interfaces, and budget \n\nA big question is, \"How many people must we have to do mission operations?\" The \nobvious answer is, \"It depends.\" It depends on the organization's operational require-\nments and constraints, as well as the number and complexity of functions, complexity \nof the mission design, complexity of flight and ground systems, and how much risk the \noperations organization will take. \n\nThe number of operations people required can vary significantly between military, \ncommercial, and scientific spacecraft and can vary significantly between individual \nmissions within each category. The cost difference between a 5 person operations team \nand a 50 person operations team is 6 to 7 million dollars per year. This chapter will try \nand identify how differences in payload and spacecraft design, space environment, \nground systems, the ops organization design, and risk policies can influence opera-\ntions costs. \n\nSection 14.1 describes a process for operations design and development. We \nemphasize the importance of defining an early operations concept to clarify require-\nments on the operations system. Anned with these requirements, we can meet goals \nfor operations costs by negotiating with the other space mission elements to reduce \ntheir operational complexity, thus keeping costs acceptable across the full mission life \ncycle. Once we've iterated through the process, gotten costs within guidelines, and \ndeveloped a workable mission operations concept and design, we can more effectively \ndeal with the cost drivers for mission operations. \n\nSection 14.2 defines mission operations in terms of 13 functions that are common \nacross a wide variety of mission types and operations team sizes. Analyzing each \nfunction helps us understand recent trends in trying to reduce costs and in automation. \nSection 14.3 then discusses what determines the size and cost of space mission \noperations. \n\n\n\nr \n' \u2022\u2022 !'. \u00b7i\u00b7.\n\nJ\n\n\u00b7 II ~ ,I f \n, \nI \n\nI I \n\n590 Mission Operations 14.1 \n\nWe're now converting functions that people have done into ones that hardware and \nsoftware can do. We're also moving onto the spacecraft parts of operations functions \ntraditionally done on the ground Using software in place of people doesn't always \nsave money but we need to assess this option. Section 14.4 provides some guidelines \nand insights about high payoffs from investments in operations technology and \nautomation. \n\nFor a detailed discussion of the design of mission operations for scientific remote \nsensing missions, see Wall and Ledbetter [1991]. Because of the continuing pressure \nto contain cost. a number of authors has described methods for operations cost reduc-\ntions on both individual missions [Bloch, 1994; Mandl et al., 1994; van der Ha, 1992] \nand various classes of missions [Cameron, Landshof, and Whitworth, 1994; Hughes, \nShirah, and Luczak. 1994; Landshof, Harvey, and Marshall, 1994]. Much of this cost \nreduction strategy has been summarized by Boden and Larson [1995] and Marshall, \nLandshof, and van der Ha [1996]. \n\n14.1 Developing a Mission Operations Plan \n\nFor unmanned space missions the Mission Operations Plan (MOP) describes in \noperators' and users' tenns the operational attributes of the flight and ground-based \nelements. The plan usually results from the cooperative work of several disciplines. Its \ndevelopment is similar to that of a space mission concept but the MOP is more detailed \nand emphasizes the way we operate the mission and use the flight vehicle (operational \ncharacteristics), crew, and ground operations team. It is generated in phases and \nbecomes more detailed as our mission design progresses. \n\nThe MOP follows from. and must be consistent with, the mission concept It is one \nof the most important deliverables from the mission operations organization before \nlaunch. A good MOP helps assure that the operations organization provides a tested \nand certified mission operations system that meets requirements at the lowest cost The \noperations organization and management also use the MOP as their main tool to influ-\nence the design and operability of the mission and spacecraft. Its iterative development \noften changes the mission concept. flight vehicle, and software, both flight and \nground. By combining the operations concept with assessments of operational \ncomplexity, we can determine the probable costs of operations early in the mission \ndesign. Table 14-1 outlines the steps needed to develop a useful MOP. \n\nStep 1. Identify the Mission Concept, Supporting Architecture. and \nKey Performance Requirements \n\nWe begin developing the MOP by examining the mission concept and supporting \narchitecture. By obtaining the information listed below, we can describe the mission \nin language that users and operators understand. Sometimes information isn't avail-\nable. Sometimes, the operations design isn't very far along or isn't specified in the \nmission architecture. In these cases, we make assumptions and document them in the \nMOP. Of course, we update the MOP as the assumptions change or more data becomes \navailable. We can then determine the cost of changes by modifying the operations con-\ncept and re-evaluating the cost and complexity of the mission operations. \n\nMission objectives identify what the ground crew, spacecraft. and payload must do \nfor mission success. They help us derme and descn\"be how people will use the payload \ndata. We also need to know the timeliness requirements for payload-processed data \nand the mission's overall criteria for success, such as the amount of data to be returned. \n\n14.1 Developing a Mission Operations Plan 591 \n\nTABLE 14-1.

Observation strategies describe how we'll \ncollect the mission data. We define and finalize the observation strategies and mission \ndescription before launch or adapt them to data gathered during the mission. \n\nSometimes, the operations organization develops the operating philosophies, strat-\negies, and tactics. They may relate to the mission objectives or simply derive from the \ndesigner's background or experience. We must determine whether the philosophies \nstrategies, and tactics are mandatory, highly desirable, or just personal or organiza~ \ntional preference. Examples include \n\n\u2022 Maximize real-time contact and commanding versus onboard autonomy and \ndata-storage \n\n\u2022 Maximize the involvement of educational institutions and teach students key \naspects of issues like operations or space physics \n\n\u2022 Make sure a central authority approves all commands \n\n\u2022 Limit the image budget to 50,000 images \n\n\u2022 Deploy a communications satellite early in the mission \n\nThe mission sponsor and the project manager may impose nontechnical con-\nstraints. Operators usually follow these constraints until the project manager learns \nthey increase the mission's cost or make operations unacceptable or unsafe. Examples \nof program constraints include \n\n\u2022 Limit mission cost and cost profiles \n\n\u2022 Use a specific tracking network (for example, TDRS) \n\n\u2022 Use existing flight hardware \n\n\u2022 Use existing ground systems and design the spacecraft to be compatible with \nthem \n\n\u2022 Centralize or distribute operational teams \n\n\u2022 Use multi-mission versus project-dedicated tearns \n\n\u2022 Involve educators and the academic community, including students \n\nWe must identify capabilities and characteristics of the end-ta-end information \nsystem early on so we clearly understand the mission's information' needs. These \nrequirements at the system level include \n\n\u2022 Using information standards \n\n\u2022 Locating capabilities and processes (includes both space and ground) \n\n\u2022 Characterizing inputs and outputs for the information systems \n\nWe must state the information systems requirements in terms that operators and \nusers can understand, not in jargon used by computer scientists and programmers. \n\nAs discussed in Chap. 15, most missions are designed around a specific agency's \nground system, such as the Air Force's Satellite Control Network, NASA's Satellite \nTracking and Data Network (STDN), or the European Space Operations Center. Each \nground system has standard services that support the mission at lower cost if the \n\n14.1 Developing a Mission Operations Plan 593 \n\nmission meets specified interfaces and standards. We follow these requirements on the \nflight system until they hinder our ability to meet mission objectives. \n\nThis first step is key to the overall success and cost of mission operations. Here we \ngain insight about what to do and why. We begin determining performance require-\nments and constraints that will drastically affect the mission's cost and complexity. If \nwe get the requirements wrong, we get the system wrong. \n\nStep 2. Determine Scope ofFunctioDS Needed for Mission OperatioDS \n\nBefore deciding how functions must be done, we usually divide the mission into \ndiscrete, workable phases such as launch, early orbit, normal operations, entry, \ndescent, and landing. These phases usually have distinct goals and objectives, so their \noperational requirements are different. The mission concept drives top-level functions, \nbut abilities of the crew, spacecraft, and payload determine the detailed functions we \nmust carry out. A completely autonomous payload requires few crew operations, \nwhereas a spacecraft payload that can't compute or store enough data onboard may \nrequire more control or automation on the ground. Thus, to determine what we must \ndo, we have to understand characteristics of the spacecraft bus and payload. Charac-\nteristics essential to the mission concept may become clear early in the conceptual \ndesign phase. Or we may develop them as part of the Mission Operations Plan. \nThrough iterative discussions, the operators and developers define the characteristics \ndescribed below. \n\nUsers often ask operators to support a wide variety and number of payloads during \na mission. Including payload designers and mission planners while developing the \nmission concept leads to timely definition of the payload characteristics. For a \nmultiple-payload mission, we must understand early how each payload's constraints \ninteract with the operations of other payloads and the ground system. \n\nTo understand how a payload operates, we must describe what the payload does \nduring an operational period by asking \n\n\u2022 What are the payload attributes? \n\u2022 What is the commanding philosophy-buffer use, micrO-commands, tables? \n\u2022 Does the payload use default values? Can ground operators change them? \n\u2022 Can some commands damage the payload or endanger the spacecraft? \n\u2022 Do some operations depend on previous commands? \n\u2022 Does the payload use position commands or incremental commands to control \n\nrotating or stepping mechanisms? \n\u2022 What command classes does the payload use-real-time, stored, 2-stage? \n\n\u2022 What processing occurs within the instrument? \n\u2022 How can we describe the payload in terms of \n\n- CPU/memory, closed-loop functions, and predictive commanding vs. event-\ndriven commanding? \n\n- Instruments the space element must control? \n- Mechanical power and thermal attributes? \n- Avoidance areas (Sun, Earth, South Atlantic Anomaly, Venus, or Moon)? \n- Requirements for controlling the space element? \n- Safety constraints? \n\n\n\nI I \nI \n\n594 Mission Operations 14.1 \n\n\u2022 Do the payload apertures drive the space vehicle's pointing control? \n\u2022 What are the user-specified parameters for operation? \n\u2022 How do these parameters convert into payload commands? \n\u2022 What is the payload heritage? \n\n\u2022 What ground processing and analysis do we need to support its operation? \n\nThe example below shows how planning payload operations helps us define the \nmission concept. It also shows how operational workarounds support mission success. \n\nAn instrument's aperture bad a field of view of ten arc-sec. The spacecraft bad pointing \ncapability of 20 arc-sec. In this case, the operators could never be sure the object was in the \ninstrument's field of view. The solution was to: \n\n\u2022 Command the spacecraft to the desired position \n\u2022 Observe with a different instrument baving a wider field of view to see bow far the \n\nspacecraft was off the desired position \n\u2022 Generate attitude commands to move the spacecraft slightly (tweak commands) until \n\nthe actual attitude corresponded to the desired attitude \n\u2022 Verify the attitude errors were gone \n\u2022 Select the instrument with the narrow aperture and ob,serve as specified \n\nThis single design error cansed real-time operations, sucb as decision making and command-\ning, to become nonroutine for this missio~ big cost driver. These operations required more \nground software, controllers trained in commanding the attitude-control system, and more \npeople wbenever they used the instrument The goal of generating a MOP is to identify early \nany incompatibilities and cost drivers like this one-before we design and build any hardware. \n\nIt's a good idea to ask the designer of a payload instrument how to go from an \nobserver requirement to a set of commands for the instrument Sometimes, the answer \nis simple, but it could be complex if instruments have been designed for a laboratory \nrather than for space operation. \n\nAs is trUe for the payload's capabilities and characteristics, timely definition of the \nspacecraft's characteristics depends on including spacecraft designers and mission \nplanners in developing the mission concept People working on the concept have to \nanswer the following types of questions for the overall spacecraft and its subsystems: \n\n\u2022 What are the spacecraft's operational attributes? \n\n\u2022 How are the values of these commands determined? \n\n\u2022 How many commandable states are required? \n\n\u2022 Are engineering calibrations required? What are the purpose, frequency, and \nschedule constraints of the calibrations? \n\n\u2022 How many engineering channels need monitoring? \n\n\u2022 Do these channels provide subsystem-level information to the operators, or \nmust operators derive information about subsystems? \n\n\u2022 Are guide stars used? If so, how are they selected? \n\n\u2022 How does the pointing-control accuracy compare to instrument requirements? \n\n14.1 Developing a Mission Operations Plan 595 \n\n\u2022 What types of payload, ground and spacecraft system margins exist and which \nmust be monitored and controlled in real time? \n\n\u2022 What expendables need monitoring during flight? \n\n\u2022 Does the spacecraft subsystem use any onboard, closed~loop functions? \n\n\u2022 What are the attributes of the spacecraft's data system? \n\n\u2022 What processing must we do on the ground to support spacecraft operations? \n\n\u2022 What is the heritage for each of the spacecraft's subsystems? \n\nConsider an example of how a simple design decision affects opemtions: \n\nThe Galileo spacecraft was designed to take heat from the radio-\nisotopic thermoelectric generators and use it to warm the propulsion \nsystem. This design saved weight and power, and it cost less to \ndevelop. But the spacecraft's operational characteristics tied together \nsubsystems for propulsion health and safety, thermal transfer, an~ \npower. Operators had to check each command load to see how It \nchanged power states and affected the propulsion subsystem. Engi-\nneers from power, thermal, and propulsion had to check each activity, \neven if only the payload instrument's states changed. For example, \nturning an instrument on or off caused the heat output of the thermo-\nelectric generator to change. \n\nThis example shows that highly-coupled subsystems can make operating the system \nmore complex and c~stly. . \n\nWe must work with the end-users or customers to determme how, and how often, \nthey require data from the payload. We also need to identify key operator tasks to \noperate the payload successfully. By understanding these data products and ~ \nactions, we can start designing how to operate the payload, as well as to retneve and \nprocess the data. \n\nWe must understand how confident the end-users are about the products. Often, \nthey don't know what they want until they see how the payload works in flight and \nwhat it observes. In these cases, we must develop baseline processes before launch and \nrefine them after launch. For attached and deployable payloads from manned space-\ncraft. the payload must be mature enough to ensure no safety risks exist, either within \na payload, or with another payload running simultaneously. We must develop early !he \nprocedures for payloads that we can maintain in flight, so we can use them during \nstand-alone and integrated crew training. \n\nWe also need to define the product's relationship to the payload data by answering \nthe following questions: \n\n\u2022 Is the product based on the payload's raw data or must we remove the payload \ninstrument's signatures? \n\n\u2022 Must the data be calibrated? How? Does it involve processing special calibra-\ntion observations? At what rate do we expect the calibration ftIes to change? \n\n\u2022 Does the data need to be converted into geophysical units? How? Where do \nthe algorithms for this conversion come from? Must the project generate them \nand update the mission database, as they become more refined? \n\n\n\nS!J6 Mission Operations 14.1 \n\n\u2022 What are the formats and media of the payload's data products? Is there a \ncommunity standard, such as the Flexible Image Transport System format \nused on all NASA's astrophysics missions? \n\n\u2022 What ancillary data must we provide so the end-user can interpret the payload \ndata-spacecraft position and attitude, ground truth, or crew commentary? \n\n\u2022 Who processes the payload data-project or end user? \n\n\u2022 How is the processed data archived-through the project or end user? How is \nquality of the product controlled? \n\n\u2022 What, if anything, must the project archive after the flight phase is over? How \nlong must information be stored? \n\nPlanners and payload engineers must consider these issues jointly to understand \nopemtionally what will occur during flight \n\nStep 3. Identify Ways to Accomplish Functions and Whether Capability Exists \nor Must Be Developed \n\nAt this level, many functions and the ways to do them are straightforward. For \nexample, to track an interplanetary spacecraft, we use NASA's Deep Space Network. \nFor other functions, we must identify options and describe them. For example, to \ndetermine a spacecraft's orbit, we might use the Global Positioning System and auto-\nmated procedures on board, or we might track the spacecraft from the ground and \ncalculate its orbit on the ground. Mainly, we must decide where the prime responsibil-\nity for each function li~nboard autonomy, ground-based operators, or automated \nfunctions. Then we must review our decisions in light of the capabilities on board and \non the ground, as well as how critical the action is. \n\nTo understand options, try building a table that contains the opemtions functions \nwhich apply to the mission's database and space element's avionics. Then, identify \nwhether the avionics (automated) or the mission opemtions system are to do each func-\ntion. If functions must be done on the ground, further determine whether the hardware, \nsoftware, or operators should complete it. If a function could be done in more than one \nplace, describe what to do in each place and options for doing it. Table 14-2 shows how \nsuch a table would look. \n\nIf the ground hardware and software do something, ask, \"Could the avionics \npartially or completely do this function and lower the mission's life-cycle costs?\" For \nexample, if we were considering orbit determination, we'd ask, \"Could we determine \nthe spacecraft location within the avionics?' Then, we'd look at the accuracy of the \nGPS system, check the cost of GPS receivers that are flight qualified, and do a frrst-\norder estimate of the change in life-cycle costs compared to a more typical approach. \nDon't forget that the costs of tracking facilities are important in this type of trade. The \nlonger the mission, the. more ground systems cost \n\nStep 4. Do Trades for Items Identified in the Previons Step \n\nFor the options identified in step 3 that drive either performance or cost, a small \ngroup of opemtors, crew and designers need to do trades and decide how to carry them \nout. At this point these trades should involve areas that are very costly, controversial, \nor not well understood. In some cases, we may develop an operations scenario for each \noption to descn\"be it in detail. Usually, these trades result in a traditional allocation of \n\n14.1 Developing a Mission Operations PIan 597 \n\nTABLE 14-2. Identifying Where to Carry Out Functions. Using a table simnarto this one helps \nus identify options for carrying out mission operations. We assume functions not \nincluded in table are done on the ground. As you evaluate each function, place a \ncheck mark In the table to show where you complete the function. \n\nWhere AccompOshed \n\nMOSFuncUon Spacecraft Avionics Ground \n\nMission PlaMing Operator augmented with \nautomated tools Is primary \n\nActivitY Planning Operator augmented with \nand Development automated tools Is primary \n\nMission Control Operator is primary \n\nData Transport Many LEO telecommunications Software and hardware \nand Delivery spacecraft implement much of this provide primary capability \n\nfunction onboard \n\nNavigation and Orbit Software and hardware on spacecraft Software and hardware is \nControl is an option primary \n\nSpacecraft Operations Short- and long-term planning \nby operators, augmented with \nautomated tools \n\nPayload Operations Short- and long-term planning \nby operators, augmented with \nautomated tools \n\nfunctional responsibilities to the flight crew, avionics, and opemtors. The key here is \nto look for approaches that truly minimize Jife-cycle cost without jeopardizing the \nsafety and reliability of the mission and systems. \n\nStep 5. Develop Operational Scenarios and Flight Techniqnes \n\nOperational scenarios are key to an operations concept. A scenario is a list of steps, \nand we can often describe a mission opemtions concept with several dozen top-level \nscenarios. Typically, we genemte three types of scenarios: \n\n\u2022 User Scenario-How the user interacts with the system elements and receives \ndata. \n\n\u2022 System Scenario-How systems and subsystems within an element work \ntogether. \n\n\u2022 Element Scenario-How the elements of the space mission architecture work \ntogether to accomplish the mission. \n\nDuring the early study phases of a mission, users develop a scenario to show how \nthey want to acquire data and receive products from the payload. For a science mis-\nsion, the user would be the principal investigator or science group or, for a facility \nspacecraft such as the Hubble Space Telescope, an individual observer. \n\nWe create a system scenario after we've developed the opemtions architecture. \nHere, we emphasize the .steps within a process needed to conduct the mission. Finally, \n\n\n\n598 Mission Operations 14.1 \n\nduring element design, we expand these system scenarios to include more detailed \ninformation and subsystems. Once we have created scenarios for the user, system, and \nelement, we must integrate them to understand what happens throughout the mis-\nsion and make sure we've included all key activities and eliminated overlaps. The \nscenarios give us our first look at how our system operates as a unit to produce the \nmission data. \n\nThe mission concept, Mission Operations Plan, and design of the space and ground \nelements are closely related. As design proceeds, we should keep cost in mind and \nrecognize that engineers normally focus on the technical challenge, with costs second-\nary. All participants in the conceptual design not only must keep cost in mind, but \nshould view it as a design variable. As designs mature for all elements of the space \nmission architecture, we must do trade studies to get the most cost-effective mission \ndesign. If the budget is constrained, which it usually is, we must look for ways to \nreduce costs by changing the mission concept, mission requirements, and potentially, \nthe mission's overall objectives. \n\nStep 6. Develop TimeUnes for Each Scenario \n\nNow we can add times needed to do each set of steps and determine which steps \ncan run in parallel or have to be serial. This information becomes a source of derived \nrequiiements for the mission operations system's performance. \n\nMany different timeline tools are used. None is standard, but many are modified \nfrom commercial, off-the-shelf software. Most missions use the same timeline tools \nfor operational scenarios and activity planning. For many smaller payload users, \nasking for planning support from the MCC is less expensive than investing in a parallel \nplanning system. These requirements must fit within the scope of the agreements \namong the program, operations, and the user. In many cases, the MCC has already \nrequired information that it can make available to you. In other cases, teams must \ngenerate ancillary data or change plans to fit unique needs for payload planning. If \nthese changes are extensive, a separate planning system may be the effective solution. \n\nStep 7. Determine the Resources Needed for Each Step of Each Scenario \n\nOnce we've developed scenarios, we may assign machines or people to do each \nstep. This choice is obvious for many steps, but people or machines may do others, \ndepending on performance requirements and available technology. The trend is \ntoward automation on the ground and autonomy in space. We must be careful to iden-\ntify, as specifically as possible, which tasks the flight crew should do. \n\nHaving allocated resources (hardware, software, or people), we must assign steps \nto hardware and software within data-flow diagrams. For steps assigned to people, we \nselect an existing organization or develop an operational organization and assign steps \nand functions to teams. \n\nAt this point, we examine each step to which we've assigned an operator and ask, \n\"Can this process be automated to eliminate the operator?\" How? Allow a person to \ndo something only when the complexity or flexibility or life-cycle costs mandate \nhuman involvement. Don't accept the idea that we need a person because we've \nalways done it that way. Technology is advancing so rapidly that a machine may very \nwell do now what a person had to do on the last mission. Through this process, we'll \nalso discover areas on which to focus research and development funding for possible \nautomation in future missions. \n\n14.1 Developing a Mission Operations Plan 599 \n\nStep 8. Develop Data-flow Diagrams \n\nSystem-engineering tools can convert machine steps into data-flow diagrams \nshowing processes, points for data storage, and interrelationships. They also generate \na data dictionary that ensures a unique name for each process or storage point in the \ndata flow. These computer-aided systems engineering tools then generate information \nyou can use for development. One of the most effective actions you can take to reduce \noverall life-cycle cost is to understand where data originates and the flow it takes \nthroughout your system to the end user or customer and to your archive. Figure 2-2 in \nSec. 2.1.1 shows a top-level data-flow diagram for FrreSat. \n\nStep 9. Characterize Responsibilities of Each Team \n\nOnce we've defined functions and processes, gathered the people-related steps, \nand formed an organization around them, we can assign teams to the steps and analyze \nthe organization to establish operational interfaces. Generally, the more inputs we get \nfrom different teams, the more complicated, costly, and slow the operations organiza-\ntions are. The goal of this step is to identify the number of people required to do \nmission operations during each mission phase. We'll use this information to estimate \nthe cost of operations. We should be open to approaches and trade-offs that reduce \noveralllife-cycle cost \n\nStep 10. Assess Mission Utility, Complexity, and Operations Cost Drivers \n\nTo assess mission utility, we follow the overall process defined in Sec. 33. To do \nso early in design !pay require flexible simulations, in which input parameters and sys-\ntem parameters have a range of values. Operational simulations that produce outputs \nwhich meet mission objectives are candidates fOr the Mission Operations Plan. As the \nplan matures, assessing mission utility yields confidence in the design or highlights \nshortcomings for re-design. \n\nTo assess operations complexity and how it drives mission operations cost, we use \na complexity model that shows the relationship between operational parameters and \nfull time equivalent operators. This model requires us to evaluate each of our opera-\ntional activities as low, medium, or high complexity. Then, based on previous mis-\nsions of the same class, the model produces the number of operations personnel. \nDuring design, this model gives us rules for trade studies to reduce operations costs. \nBoden and Larson [1996, Chap. 5] describe this model in detail. See Sec. 14.3 for a \nsummary. \n\nStep 11. Identify Derived Requirements \n\nAt this point, we've updated the Mission Operations Plan with new information \nassociated with the mission operations concept, requirements, existing and new capa-\nbilities, scenarios, timelines. and the anticipated life-cycIe cost Now, we can identify \nnew or derived requirements necessary to reduce cost and complexity and enhance the \nsafety and reliability of operations. We should document these derived requirements \nin the Mission Operations Plan, being careful to identify what is to be done-not \nhow-and why the requirements are necessary. Then, we should co~unicate the \nderived requirements to the group that develops the mission's conceptual design and \nnegotiate them into the requirement baseline. \n\n\n\n600 MIssion Operations 14.2 \n\nStep 12. Generate a Tecbnology Development Plan \n\nThe technology to support a mission operations concept may not exist or may not \nbe focused and prototyped appropriately for mission approval. With each iteration of \nthe Mission Operations Plan, we must identify needed or risky technology, sp some-\none can develop the technology or create work-arounds. \n\nStep 13. Iterate and Document \n\nThe last, and usually most painful, step is to document the results of the iteration \nthrough the Mission Operations Plan to develop a baseline from which we can COn-\ntinue to improve and reduce life-cycIe cost The documentation should include at least \nthese elements: \n\n\u2022 Requirements and mission objectives \n\n\u2022 Key constraints--cost, schedule, and technical performance \n\u2022 Assumed mission and flight rules \n\u2022 Scenarios~iescribed in terms of functions \n\u2022 Tnnelines for each key scenario \n\n\u2022 Ground and flight crew tasks \n\n\u2022 Organization and team responsibilities and structure \n\u2022 Hardware and software functions \n\u2022 Data-flow diagrams \n\n\u2022 Payload requirements and derived requirements \n\nRemember that this document is the basis for communicating the overall operations \napproach to users, operators, and system developers. If done and used properly, it can \nhelp save millions of dollars in the design and operation of space systems. We strongly \nrecommend keeping the Mission Operations Plan in electronic form and making it \nreadily available to all members of the conceptual design team, so they can keep the \nbig picture in mind as they further develop concepts, systems, and approaches. The \nearlier the fIrst Mission Operations Plan appears. the greater the leverage for reducing \nlife-cycle costs. \n\nNow that we understand how to develop a Mission Operations Plan. we need a \nmore detailed understanding of what mission operators do, so we can create a better \nand more detailed plan. \n\n14.2 Overview of Space Mission Operations Functions \n\nAlthough space mission types vary widely across military, scientifIc. and commer-\ncial applications. flight teams on the ground operate with fairly common tasks and \nactivities. In this section we'll describe these common operational tasks and then show \nhow mission differences can influence performance requirements and hence the styles \nand costs of accomplishing the tasks. \n\nFigure 14-1 at the beginning of the chapter shows 13 functions for space mission \noperations. Table 14-3 summarizes the associated attributes of these functions. For \nsmall projects. members of a single team may do these tasks. For larger projects, \n\n14.2 Overview of Space MIssion Operations Functions 601 . \n\nsubteams may form; each dedicated to one of the functions in the table. On some \nprojects, a single subteam does several of the functions, whereas another subteam may \ndo only a part of one function. \n\nTABLE 14-3.

A thorough understanding of \nea.ch. function i~ important for efficient design, estimating costs, and managing space \nITIISSIOn operations. \n\n1. Mission Planning \n\nMission planning starts before activity planning. It defines how to use resources \n~t in accom~li~hing mission goals. Mission planning produces rough activity time-\nlm~ .a~oss ml~lon phases that identify the schedule and resources to complete major \nactiVities. The mterface between mission planning and activity planning can be as gen-\neral as operations based activity guidelines or as specific as a detailed timeline of \nactivity requests that later gets converted into commands. \n\nResources that mission planners and designers are concerned with include the \ntrajectory or orbit design, consumables over the spacecraft's lifetime, and long-range \n\n14.2 Overview of Space Mission Operations Functions 603 \n\nfacility support. This task can be relatively easy for missions with low activity levels, \nsimple trajectories, and reasonable margins for spacecraft consumables.It's also easy \nfor supporting facilities with high availability that we can schedule far in advance. \nMission planning can be very complex for missions that have oversubscribed time-\nlines, a complex trajectory, tight budgets for spacecraft consumables, and over-used, \nshared resources. Timelines become oversubscribed whenever requests for engineer-\ning and payload activities overwhelm the time for the spacecraft to do them. Examples \nof complex trajectory design include planetary gravitational assists, rendezvous and \ndocking, formation flying and planetary landers. Consumables that may have tight \nmargins-requiring mission planning to allocate and manage budgets-include power \n(battery charge-discharge cycles), propellant, cryogen, total radiation dose, and cycles \nof mechanical devices, such as number of thruster firings, valve openings, and slewing \nof a scan platform. Examples of shared resource facilities that may be overbooked and \ncomplicate mission planning include the Deep Space Network's 70 m antennas and \nwide-band links on TDRSS. Complexity and costs for mission planning grow geo-\nmetrically, rather than linearly, as each factor increases in complexity because tbeir \nintemctions increase. \n\nContingency planning is another task assigned to Mission Planning. We usually \nadd contingency reserves to consumable budgets and desIgn busy timelines to include \na few planned, low-activity periods that are available for unplanned, contingency \nactivities. Some missions demonstrate cost effectiveness by scheduling \"bonus\" \npayload activities they can drop\u00b7to respond to contingencies, but which get executed \nif everything goes as planned. The most common form of operations contingencies we \nplan for are spacecraft or payload anomalies, degraded performance, and changes to \nfacility schedules. Contingency planning for more adaptive missions sometimes \ninclude responding quickly to surprise opportunities or changing conditions. \n\n2. Activity Planning and Development \nThis operations function produces the spacecraft's stored sequences discussed \n\nabove. Activity planning converts requests for spacecraft and payload activities into a \nfile of timed commands for uplink to the spacecraft. This command fjle is a sequence \nof commands that are integrated, time-ordered, constraint-checked, simulated, validat-\ned, reviewed, approved, and defect-free. Activity planning often generates real-time \ncommands that may require simulation or constraint checking before passing them to \nMission Control for uplinking. \n\nThree factors influence the difficulty and cost of activity planning: complexity of \nthe process for integrating requests, required accuracy of the constraint checking and \nperformance models used to simulate and validate the activity plans, and duration for \nwhich the activity plan is to be active. \n\nMissions with simple activity inputs and integration processes usually have a small \nnumber of users. They use an efficient format for activity requests, often electronic, \nwith requests written by users in the command language. In addition, their mission \nresources are under-subscribed, so most requests can be scheduled and executed with \nfew conflicts between requests. Examples of constrained mission resources that can \ncomplicate how we integrate the activity plan include limited onboard sequencing \nmemory, limited time to carry out activities, limited power, limited onboard data stor-\nage or downlink bit rate, and limited tracking resources or downlink time. Missi ons \nthat must develop highly constrained activity plans sometimes reduce costs by pre-\nallocating resources and then pushing conflict-resolution tasks back on the requesting \nteams from Mission Design, Spacecraft Engineering, Payload, or Operations. \n\n\n\n604 Mission Operations \n14.2 14.2 Overview of Space Mission Operations Functions 605 \n\nAccuracy in spacecraft-perfonnance models can also drive activity planning. For \nexample, suppose we need to plan a spa~-pointing maneuver to move a sensor's \nbo~lght from .~get A to target B, usmg pre-p!anned, timed commands. This plan \nreq~ a pred!ctive model of slew rates, turn times, and settling times. Models for \npropulsIOn, attitude control, thermal, power, and telecom can all require frequent \ntuning and calibration. That means designing and doing flight tests, as well as \n~easuring ~d do~g a spacecrat:t's performance parameters and then compar_ \nIng them With prediCtions. After analYSIS, we would update the models. This process \ncan consume a lot of operations resources, not just in activity planning but also in data \ncollection and analysis. Missions ~th. performance margins can use lower fidelity \nmodels and save money. But some mISSions, such as a planetary flyby spend hundreds \nof milli?ns ~f ~o~:us to do a few ~ours of an activity plan for closest approach. They \nwant to optimize spacecraft and Instrument performance, so they're willing to invest \nin high-fidelity, accurately calibrated performance models. \n\nSelecting the duration of a stored activity plan is a.third factor that can significantly \ninfluence activity planning costs. Activity plans that last only a few hours require fre-\nquent uplinks,. extra station coverage, '?l~ around-the-clock staffing. Short activity \nplan~ can be timed to correspond to mISSion events (such as orbit duration), don't \nreqUIre large memory storage on board, can respond to last-minute requests from \nusers, and often can adapt to activity-request conflicts in the current sequence under \ndevelopment by postponing the activity to the next one. Activity plans designed to last \n~or weeks or even months may require more onboard sequencing memory and more \ntime for uplink transmissions. With longer activity plans, requesters must think over \nmuch longer planning epochs and, if an activity doesn't get scheduled in the current \nplan, it must wait until the next one. Requesters who miss getting commands inte-\ngrated into lengthy activity plans often resort to real time commands, bypassing the \nstored sequence process and increasing the load on Mission Control. Missions that \nopera~e in this mode usually enj~y the advantage of being able to staff activity \nplanmng 5 days per week, pnme shift only. We can reduce staffing by decreasing the \nnumber of activity plans and making each one last longer. \n\n3. Mission Control \n\nMission Control handles activities that must be done in real or near real time. They \ndo last-minute adjustments to pre-scheduled mission timelines. They manage the \nground system's configuration and coordinate interface with operations facilities such \nas trackin~ stati~ns and c?mmunication services. They also manage the spacecraft's \nconfiguration USIng real-time commands and telemetry monitoring. Mission control-\nlers det~t a spacecraft's telemetry alarms and anomalies, isolate problems, and call in \na~r?pna~e ~xperts on the spacecraft or ground system. They maintain a log of \nnusslOn-slgmficant events. They often work whenever the spacecraft is being tracked, \nso controllers may have to take other than prime shifts . \n\n. ~ssion control tasks may require significant staffing and high activity levels for \nnusslOns that do many activities in near real time. This operations style is called joy-\nstick operations. It's often characteristic of missions that have short communication \ndelays, continuous or nearly continuous coverage, and less elaborate software for \nonbo~ autono~y: These missions require rapid ground reaction to unplanned events. \nJoysti~k style .mIsslOns must be able to tolerate occasional wrong commands or other \noperational nustakes common when people must respond rapidly. \n\nMission Control staffing is lower for missions that de-emphasize real-time deci-\nsions by ground operations. Instead, these missions rely on the ability to pre-plan \n\n_._------- - -----\n\nactivities and load the spacecraft with a timed command sequence that has a high \nprobability of executing successfully with minimum ground interaction. What this \nstored-sequence style saves in real-time mission control, it usually more than pays for \nthrough increased costs for design and simulation tools. Missions often use it if they \nhave long two-way light times, long periods without tracking or ground contact, and \nat least a modest investment in software for onboard autonomy. This software allows \nthe spacecraft to react to unplanned events. Missions using stored sequences can't \ntolerate errors in critical events such as a planetary flyby or injection maneuver. Thus \nthey rely on elaborate planning, simulation, and review to produce and store \nzero-defect plans. Software now handles most reflexive actions, such as monitoring \nand responding to faults in real time. \n\n4. Data Delivery (see Data Services in Function 8) \n\n5. Navigation and Orbit Control \nThis operations function delivers the flight system to the target or maintains an \n\noperational orbit It designs trajectories to meet various requirements and constraints. \nEfficient designs for trajectories or orbits can save a lot in launch-vehicle costs and the \nspacecraft's required propellant mass. As described in detail in Chapter 7, techniques \nsuch as planetary gravity assists, aerobraking, and electric propulsion are some of the \nmethods navigation uses to achieve efficiency goals. \n\nAs discussed in Section 11.7, navigation detennines the flight system's location \nand velocity by using several types of data. Radiometric data collected during telem-\netry and command passes may include one- and two-way Doppler, as well as ranging \ncodes. Some planetary spacecraft with imaging instruments use images of planets or \nasteroids and the star field background to give very precise spacecraft location data. \nSome Earth-orbiting spacecraft use onboard GPS receivers to locate the spacecraft. \nNavigation analyzes this position data to detennine trajectory or orbit corrections \nneeded to meet mission requirements. They also furnish position data to teams in Pay-\nload Operations who use it to interpret or calibrate instrument measurements. They \nalso send trajectory and orbit data to Data Services, so these teams know when to \nschedule antenna tracks and where to point them. \n\nOnce the actual trajectory has been detennined, orbit control function defines pro-\npulsive maneuvers needed for correction. Orbit control and Spacecraft Operations \nwork together closely on this process, particularly the attitude-control and propulsion \nanalysts. Desired changes to the spacecraft's velocity vector get converted to turns and \npropulsion bum times and then into spacecraft commands. Designing and analyzing a \ntrajectory correction maneuver can get complicated. We may need to model the thrust-\ners' performance, analyze gravitational effects and disturbance forces, and complete \nnoIninal and \"clean-up\" maneuver designs. \n\n6. Spacecraft Operations \nThis spacecraft engineering function oversees the spacecraft's health and safety in \n\nflight and calibrates and maintains equipment to keep the spacecraft's performance \nwithin specifications. Engineers define detailed operational configurations and states \nnecessary to support payload activities, such as modes for pointing, power, and data \nservice. They also maintain flight software and analyze spacecraft failures. \n\nSpacecraft Operations provides Mission Planning with requirements for calibrating \nand maintaining equipment to be integrated into mission activity plans. They also pro-\nvide mission planners actual resource consumption data together with performance \nmodels to help them plan and manage mission resources. \n\n\n\n606 Mission Operations 14,2 \n\nSpacecraft Operations sends requests to Activity Planning for engineering activities \nto be converted into timed commands in an integrated sequence. They often review \nactivity plans before uplinking to make sure they don't violate flight rules from space-\ncraft engineering and that they meet operational peculiarities and constraints of the \nsubsystems. Reviews cail be simple for missions that execute a routine daily set of \nstandard commands and for missions that have invested in simulation software which \nautomatically checks constraints. But they can be time consuming for missions that \nhave a high percentage of new or unique activities every day, that can't simulate ac-\ntivities and constraints, and that have subsystems which strongly constrain operations. \n\nSpacecraft Operations delegates to Mission Control the responsibility for real-time \nmonitoring of the spacecraft's health and performance (such as monitoring telemetry \nalarm limits). This delegation allows Spacecraft Engineering to concentrate on more \ndeliberative, non-real-time tasks, such as analyzing performance and predicting long-\nterm trends. It also often allows them to staff only 8 hours per day, 5 days per week. \n\nThere are two styles of fault detection and anomaly analysis. The first-a detect-\nrespond style-is less expensive. Operators watch for alarms or other unexpected \nfailures, analyze them, and prepare strategies to correct or work them. The second-a \npredict-prevent style-<:osts more. Planners predict trends and performance, trying to \nforecast faults before they might occur and then plan preventative action. This task can \ninvolve elaborate models for telemetry, power, thermal, dynamics, and other systems \nand can require significant calibrations and performance tests during a flight. Detect-\nrespond fault operations are characteristic of space missions that can handle occasional \nunplanned down times to recover from faults. Often these missions have single-string \nhardware configurations with limited options for recovering from failures. Predict-pre-\nvent fault operations are characteristic of space missions with engineering or science \nevents, for which an unplanned down time could cause loss of a mission or loss of mis-\nsion critical science data that We can't recover. Often these missions have block redun-\ndant hardware, allowing operators to select a back-up component when trending data \nsuggests a possible future failure in the main on-line, component. \n\nFailure analysis sometimes requires using test beds on the ground that allow \nanalysts to simulate or recreate problems observed in flight. Spacecraft Operations \nnnis and maintains them, which can become a significant operations cost for test-bed \nhardware (usually, engineering models for flight hardware) and managing and updat-\ning software. \n\nSpacecraft Operations also maintains and fixes flight software, then continues to \nde~elop it after launch. Missions with long flight times, changing mission goals, or \nmajor anomaly recovery work-arounds will often require significant software re-de-\nvelopment during flight. Some missions that have long flights to targets may even \ndeliberately postpone developing target-related software until after launch. Software \ntest and validation becomes another use for the flight-system testbed and another \npotential expense for Spacecraft Operations. \n\n7. Payload Operations \nThis operations function has similar interfaces as the Spacecraft Operations func-\n\ntion, but with responsibility for the payload instead of the spacecraft. Payload opera-\ntors send measurement goals and activity requests to Mission Planning and Activity \nPlanning respectively, which convert payload requests into mission timelines and \nintegrated command loads. Some designs for mission operations try to simplify these \ninterfaces by allowing payload controllers to directly command the payload's config-\nuration and method of returning data, sometimes from sites located remotely from the \n\n14.2 Overview of Space Mission Operations Functions \n\nMission Operations Center. This approach works best when individual payload instru-\nments and sensors don't interact and when instruments don't contend much for \nspacecraft resources, such as power, pointing, data storage, and downlink bandwidth. \n\nPayload operations use different data types. Operators monitor the payload \nengineering data to check the status of its health and safety. ~en, ~s~ion Con,!,>l \nhandles this task. Operators analyze data from the payload to verify that It IS producmg \nresults in ranges of expected values. This is known as quick-look analysis. It doesn't \nreplace the interpretation that becomes part of longer-term scientific discovery. Quick-\nlook analysis happens quickly, so operators can discover and correct anomalies for \ninstruments, sensors, and sequencing before they have collected, calibrated, and \narchived a lot of data. Quick-look analysis often requires concurrent recovery and \nanalysis of a payload's ancillary data (such as where the spacecraft was located-orbit \ndata), which direction it was pointed (attitude or scan-platform data), engineering \nstates of instruments (gain settings or filter selections), and sometimes relevant envi- . \nronmentaI measurements (radiation field and temperature). \n\nComplexity of instruments and investigations directly influence the size of the \nPayload Operations task. Instruments cost more to operate if they have many control \nstates, are sensitive to interactions with other instruments or the background environ-\nment, must manage their own consumables (batteries or cryogen), and face many \noperational constraints (such as avoiding the Sun or Earth, warm up, cool down, radi-\natorfield of view). Investigations with complex targets, payload tasks (such as ground \nrovers or space weapons) and activity timelines cost more to operate. Some missions \nare designed to use correlative data from other sources (such as multiple spacecraft) or \nmultiple sensors (such as measurements from ocean buoys). These missions may need \nmore effort to plan operations and analyze data. \n\n8. Data Services (Includes: (4) Data Delivery, (8) Payload Data Processing and \n(9) Archiving and Maintaining the Mission Database) \n\nThis function does various Data Service tasks including tracking and acquiring \ndata, transmitting commands, transporting data, handling local computer and commu-\nnication services, processing and displaying data, simulating data flow, maintaining \nthe Inission's database, building data products, and archiving data. IT also plans and\u00b7 \nanalyzes performance, and coordinates operation of the ground data system. It sup-\nports all other operations functions. Well designed, well run data services can be vital \nto how efficiently other operations functions do their tasks. If a mission must return a \nlot of mission data, data services can dominate operations costs. New technologies, \nsuch as CD-ROMs and the worldwide web, have greatly reduced the cost of historical \ndata products such as photographs and magnetic tape libraries. \n\nWell engineered data systems apply existing data standards so we can use standard \ndata services and tools. Handbooks from the Consultative Committee for Space Data \nStandards document standards for space data. International teams develop these \nhandbooks with U.S. representation from DoD, NASA, and industry. The standards \nseparate into layers for data timing, synchronization, transport, coding and representa-\ntion. The direction has been away from data-stream services, such as the older systems \nusing time-division multiplexed telelDetry, and toward packet-based or file-based pr0-\ntocols that permit standard services independent of content. \n\nOperations can be very efficient with well engineered data designs_ These designs \nconsider capabilities for ground processing and archiving while planning for onboard \ndata capture, processing, and packaging. On the other hand, operating a poorly \n\n\n\n, \n!I \n\n608 Mission Operations 14.2 \n\nengineered data system can be costly. Such designs require operators to recOVer \nextract, and correlate various separated data types. Other cost drivers include th~ \nrobustness of payload data processing to data loss or drop~ut and the project's poli-\ncies on what percentage of data must be recovered for mission success. Many anec-\ndotes describe missions that used 90% of their resources trying to recover the last few \npercent of data. \n\nOperations design must choose between two competing approaches to data \nsystems: multi-mission vs. mission-unique. Advocates of multi-mission data systems \nemphasize the efficiency of using a common design and a common set of operators to \nprovide data services to more than one mission. We can amortize costs for parts of a \nground data system that require large capitol investments, and this makes it more \naffordable. This approach also helps us use data standards and reuse systems. Cost-\nsharing efficiencies free up money to invest in data systems and to pay for overhead \ncosts such as maintenance, planned upgrades, and new technologies. However, \ndetractors point out that multi-mission, generic systems and organizations may be less \nefficient than those designed for, and focused on, a specific project's needs. Large \nheritage systems with significant capitol investments are expensive to change and \ncan't respond to new technology innovations as rapidly as smaller, unique systems. \n\nUsually, we decide on generic or unique data services for individual elements. Con-\nsider, for example, capturing telemetry data from deep space. This requires a network \nof large, expensive antennas-too expensive to build for each project But calibrating \npayload data might require unique project software and processes, as well as operators \ndedicated to each project. Recent development of commercial off-the-shelf software \nthat handles things like orbit analysis, command management, telemetry decommuta-\ntion and display, and simulation has allowed us to take a cost-effective hybrid \napproach. These tools have made it easier to tailor commercial, multi-mission tools for \nunique data services. \n\nShared, multi-mission data services can present a problem when they are oversub-\nscribed. Competition with other users can sometimes lead to complex scheduling that \nuses up a project's resources and complicates mission planning. Late schedule changes \nresponding to other users' emergencies can require major replanning. Over-subscrip-\ntion can become significant whenever institutions fund multi-mission data services \nand provide them \"free\" to users. To help reduce this problem, NASA is startingjUll-\ncost accounting: it will allocate costs of multi-mission institutional services to individ-\nual users. The move to data-system architectures on workstations and personal \ncomputers also helps relieve over-subscription. Hardware dedicated to a project can \nhost multi-mission software, and operators for that project can run it. \n\n10. System Engineering and Integration and Test \nThis task considers the operations system as a whole, managing interfaces and \n\nadjudicating competing desires and requirements between operational teams, tasks, \nand functional elements. For example, activity planning is easier if Mission Planning \nproduces a conflict-free timeline. Mission planning is easier if they only provide \nschedule requests and conflict-resolution guidelines to Activity Planning. System \nEngineering resolves issues like these to get the best performance from the system. \nThey also define criteria for a best system, such as low cost, high reliability, minimum \nstaffing, quick response, or all of these and more. \n\nJust as System Engineering defmes and manages interfaces between elements of a \nmission's internal operations. it does the same for elements of external operations. \nsuch as providers of institutional services or correlative data for a payload. System \n\n14.2 Overview of Space Mission Operations Functions \n\nengineers focus on technical-interface agreements. such as data formats, procedures, \nand protocols. Management focuses on program interfaces such as funding agree-\nments. System engineers develop and maintain operations concepts to help desigil and \nrefine system architecture, team responsibilities, and operations interfaces. Operations \nconcepts include scenarios, timelines, and product flows that capture the operations \nsystem performance requirements, design constraints, and requirements derived from \nthe design. \n\nSystem Engineering also plans for contingencies, resolves anomalies, and handles \nfailure recoveries. System engineers coordinate anomaly analysis that involves inter-\naction among several engineers or teams and provide technical approval of engineer-\ning change requests to develop fault repairs or work-arounds. \n\nDuring operations, the Integration and Test task supports development by testing \nnew or redelivered capabilities. It also supports testing of system interfaces when new \ninstitutional capabilities get delivered. Teams must develop test schedules to fit \noperational schedules. Engineers have to save previous versions of software to permit \nreturn to a known good system whenever testing shows the new version has problems. \nIndependent verification and validation, i.e. assigning the Integration and Test task to \nengineers different from those in Development is a common practice to ensure inde-\npendent, objective testing. \n\n11. Computers and Communications Support \n\nThis function entails designing and buying or building hardware for the end-to-end \ninformation system. Because space missions typically produce so much data in elec-\ntronic form, mission operations planners must ensure data moves efficiently. To do so, \nwe prepare data-flow diagraiDS, requirements for computers or workstations, \nrequirements for networking and data communication (within the control center and \naround the world), and requirements for voice communications. Having accurate data-\nflow diagrams (see Sec. 2.2.1) is the starting point for designing the hardware. From \nmission objectives, we learn how much data must flow, between which nodes, and \nhow frequently. We use this information to diagram the data flow and allocate data-\nhandling processes to software and hardware. From the diagrams, we list the numbers \nand types of computers, workstations, and other hardware. Knowing the communica-\ntions architecture and organizational design helps us choose the hardware correctly. \nFor example, a decentralized organization for mission operations requires us to \nconnect dispersed staff members, which usually means preparing a communications \nnetwork. \n\nThe networking requirements also come from the data-flow diagrams and Usually \nrequire more support equipment. Other networking factors are availability, capacity, \nand security for mission data.The final piece of communication support is the voice \nand video-teleconferencing requirements. Early in design, we must establish any need \nfor these special linkS so the operations organization can communicate efficiently dur-\ning the mission. \n\nBecause of the proliferation of modem computing and communication equipment, \nplanning for their support may be no more complex than ordering from industry \ncatalogs. Designing and building unique hardware usually isn't cost effective, but spe-\ncial requirements may drive us to do trade-offs in this area. Finally, maintaining and \nadmini~ng the computer and communication hardware throughout the mission is a \nvital concern. Good designs allow us to repair and replace equipment and allocate staff \nfor this activity. \n\n\n\ni \nI' \n\n610 Mission Operations 14.2 \n\n12. Development, Maintenance and Training \n\nThroughout a project's life cycle, we must develop and maintain software for: \n\u2022 Creating normal space and ground system operations before launch \n\u2022 Correcting spacecraft and ground system errors after launch \n\u2022 Implementing changes in mission requirements after launch \n\nOne modem trend for interplanetary missions is developing operations software \n~r launch. We program basic functions before launch, but create most of the opera_ \ntions software during the long cruise phase, then upload it in time for the planetary \nencounter. ~imilarly, some ~mmercial co~unications constellations have been able \nto substantially shorten thea deployment time by completing the onboard software \nsubsequent to launch of the initial phase. \n\n. Another reaso~ that flight software gets developed after launch is to deal with in-\nfl!ght hardware failures. An example of an in-flight failure is the Galileo spacecraft's \nhigh-~ain antenna. ~ launch it failed to deploy. So, progralnmers had to redesign \nthe flight software dunng the transfer phase to provide data formats and enhanced \nonboard coding for the low-gain antenna to complete the mission. \n\nTo develop and maintain software for any mission, we need to know \n\n\u2022 System requirements--use existing software from previous missions or devel-\nop new software for new requirements \n\n\u2022 Error reports--error reports drive software maintenance \n\n\u2022 Change requests-system capability changes usually require software changes \n\n\u2022 As-?uilt documentation-knowing the current software as \"built\" (not as \ndesIgned), helps us develop and maintain it more effectively. \n\nSeveral techniques for developing and maintaining software improve our probabil-\nity of having software that works: \n\n\u2022 Know.the requirements and ensure they are testable and agree with the mission \noperations concept \n\n\u2022 Use rapid prototyping to demonstrate system capabilities early \n\u2022 Deliver the ground data system in increments \n\n\u2022 Plan to develop and maintain software during operations (don't send the soft-\nware design team home too early) \n\n\u2022 Match software schedules to hardware schedules, so integration and testing \naren't delayed \n\n\u2022 Thoroughly test the software, usually incrementally \n\n\u2022 Keep operations informed of software status so operators are ready when it is \n\n\u2022 Use the new software in training, so operators know its capabilities and trust it \n\u2022 Plan further software maintenance after delivery \n\n~imilar to computer hardware, software development and maintenance change \nrap~d1y. The software package that was unique on one mission may be commercially \navad~ble for t!te nex~ New, highly flexible designs spring from unusual places, such \nas MlcrosateIIite desIgns and large constellations. Communicating what's available \nand what will work is a demanding process. \n\n14.3 Estimating the Size and Cost of Mission Operations 611 \n\n13. Management \nOperations Management has overall responsibility for operations success. Manag-\n\ners must meet operations requirements within negotiated values for cost, schedule, and \nsystem perfoimance. They provide the resources to make the other operations \nfunctions work. They focus on planning, monitoring, directing, and reporting of pr0-\ngrammatic resources such as costs, schedules, and staffing. \n\nManagers work with the sponsors and customers and negotiate mission goals vs. \nresources. They define the mission's operational policies and guidelines. An effective \nmanagement technique is to allocate resources to each operations function or team and \nthen not get involved in technical decisions or approvals unless they exceed the re-\nsources allocated. If management retains technical authority, managers also partici-\npate in and approve technical operations decisions. For any project, we have to think \nthrough how much we want management to participate in the daily approval of oper-\nations products in terms of operations response time, efficiency, team motivation, and \nvalue added. This operations element usually carries the budget for operational re-\nserves and funding for other tasks, such as administrative support. \n\n14.3 Estimating the Size and Cost of Mission Operations \n\nHow do you estimate the size of the operations task for a given mission? To some \nextent the size is influenced by the operations design itself which includes consider-\nations such as the efficiency of how the teams are organized, how tasks are assigned, \nteam member experience, how team members are trained and certified. and bow the \nteam is motivated and managed. But operations design efficiency typically can \ninfluence team size by only 10 to 20%. It does not explain why some missions can fly \nwith only a few people, whereas others require an operations team of several hundred. \n\nFig. 14-2. Four Factors that Drive the Cost of Mission OperaUons. \n\nDecisions made in designing missions, payloads and spacecraft, communication \nand ground systems, and policies on operational risk all affect operations cost and size. \nOperations often become expensive when we make these design decisions first, with-\nout considering how they affect operations. Instead, we should develop the operations \nconcept concurrently with other elements, so we can select the best overall approach \n\n\n\n612 Mission Operations 14.3 \n\nbased on affordability and lifecycle cost This section identifies important drivers of \noperations costs and organizes them into 4 factors you can use to estimate the size and \ncost of space mission operations. Figure 14-2 shows these 4 factors and their effect on \nan operations team's size and cost as operations complexity increases or decreases. \n\nTABLE 14-4.

Table 14-4 \nshows how these design decisions affect operational complexity and the \noperations team's size. \n\n\u2022 Payload and spacecraft design, is covered in Chaps. 9 through 12. It involves \ndesign choices that affect the flight system's operability. Table 14-5 shows \nhow these design choices affect operational complexity. \n\n\u2022 Design of communications, operations and ground systems is covered in \nChaps. 13 to 16. It involves design and implementation choices that influence \nwh~t tools and communication resources the operations team uses to support \ntheIr tasks. Table 14-6 shows how design decisions here affect operational \ncomplexity. \n\n\u2022 Policies on operational risk all effect cost and complexity. The more dollars \nand time we spend in developing a mission, the less operational risk we're usu-\nally willing to take. Operationally complex spacecraft require more cautious \noperations. Table 14-7 shows how these policies affect operations \ncomplexity. \n\nAfter reviewing operations cost data for many government, commercial and \nscientific missions, we have found that operations costs can be predicted reaso~ably \naccurately as ~ percentage of the total development cost of the spacecraft (i.e., payload \nplus bus). This makes sense because spacecraft that must perform complex missions \nand operate in severe environments tend to have higher development and operations \nC?sts while spacecraft with simpler missions and which operate in less severe en-\n~~ents tend to have low~r development and operations cost Organizations are \nwilling to accept more operational risks (e.g. lower ops costs) for low cost spacecraft, \nwhile organizations that have a significant investment in an expensive spacecraft or \npayload. usually insist on more risk averse, higher cost operations. Table 14-8 shows \nan experienced-based model of this relationship between first unit spacecraft plus \npayload total development cost and first year ops costs. \n\nTABLE 14-8. Estimating Mission Operations Cost per Year. Arst estimate the theoretical first \nunit cost from Chap. 20 and determine the category of spacecraft. Using the \npercentages in the second column estimate the low, high, and average mission \noperations costs per year.

If your assessment \nresults in a more complex mission, a higher percentage should be used from the second \ncolumn of Table 14-8. A lower percentage would be used for a less complex mission. \n\n14.3 Estimating the S*JZe and Cost of Mission Operations 615 \n\nOne of the most important operational issues is whether support is required around \nthe clock or only 40 hours per week. If the mission is designed with this in mind such \nthat continuous operational support is not required. then personnel costs can be \nreduced by a factor of 4 or more. If continuous support is required to meet specific \nmission needs. we must then determine whether 4 or 5 operations teams are needed. \nbased on the assessment in Table 14-9. Fmally, we multiply the number of teams times \nthe number of people per team to get the total operations personnel for the mission. \nThis should be done separately for each of the major mission phases, since some \nphases may be much more operations intensive than others . \n\nTABLE 14-9.

NASA has also recently developed a Space Operations Cost \nModel that has operations cost estimation modules for planetary and Earth orbiter \nmissions, orbiting space facilities, launch system ops, and human spaceflight (lunarl \nMars) mission operations. \n\n14.4 Automating Spacecraft and Ground Operations Functions* \n\nAs discussed in Sees. 2.1.2,11.7 and Chap. 23, continuing technology advances in \nspacecraft computing and memory capacity, together with improved software capabil. \nities, are now making it possible to do things on board the spacecraft that people on \nthe ground have done. Some examples are \n\n\u2022 Monitoring alarms \n\n\u2022 Managing spacecraft resources \n\n\u2022 Analyzing performance and trends \n\n\u2022 Onboard navigation and orbit control \n\n\u2022 Adaptively planning activities \n\n\u2022 Processing payload data \n\n\u2022 Detecting faults-sating the vehicle-recovering from failures \n\n\u2022 Adaptively capturing and downlinking data \n\n\u2022 Constraint checking commands \n\n\u2022 Mining data \n\n\u2022 Archiving data \n\nMigrating these functions from the ground to the spacecraft can save a lot of money \nby reducing ground operations tasks and the need for continuous staffing and fast \nresponse from the operations team. It can reduce the amount of routine data we must \ntransmit over expensive space communication links, process on the ground, and \nanalyze. Processes performed on the spacecraft can use timely data, free from delays \nin space communication links and uncorrupted by transmission errors. \n\nIt's helpful to distinguish four levels of autonomy. The first level of autonomy is \nonboard closed-loop processes. Examples might be closed-loop thermal control, \nmomentum management, attitude control, and even navigation and orbit control. The \nsecond level of autonomy is the ability of a spacecraft to execute planned events with\u00b7 \nout human intervention via a stored onboard sequence of timed commands. At the \n\n\u2022 This section discusses general characteristics of autonomy, not necessarily related to reducing \nmission cost. Sec. 2.1.2 discusses the use of autonomy to reduce cost. Sec. 11.7 discusses the \nspecific example of autonomous navigation and orbit control as a means of reducing both cost \nand risk. Finally, Sec. 23.3 discusses implementing the concept of \"autonomy in moderation\" \nfor general spacecraft fimctions to reduce cost and risk. \n\n14.4 \nAutomating Spacecraft and Ground Operations Functions 617 \n\nthird level of autonomy, the spacecraft can react to unplanned events through event-\ndriven rules. At the fourth level ~f autonomy, spa~ rea~ to unI?lanned even~ not \n.ust by executing rules but by usmg forms of onboard mtelligence, inference engines, \nJ . ts and plannmg agen . \n\nMost spacecraft have level 1 autonomy and exploit onboard control loops. M~st \npacecraft have level 2 autonomy and can execute pre-planned sequences by usmg \n\n:une-tagged commands referenced to their own clocks. Many spacecraft have l.evel \nthree autonomy in that they can sense and respond to unplanned hardware failure \nevents by executing fault response rules that switch them to safe modes or that auton-\nomously reconfigure the spacecraft to ~ackup, redundant hardware components: ~ome \nspacecraft go beyond just hardware fatlure event response and have the capabIli~ to \nxecute rule-based responses to payload-sensor events as well. Spacecraft are testing \n~ut level 4 autonomy by flying software that will perform autonomo~ on~ \nadaptive planning and resource management Deep Space 1 has onboard mtelligent \nagent software and Europa Orbiter will fly an adaptive, prioritized goal achieving ex-\necution engine. \n\nAutonomy can enhance mission capabilities but it may not always reduce opera-\ntional costs. Onboard control loops can require extra operations attention to the \nperformance of flight software and management of flight computer resources. The cre-\nation of sequences or activity plans may require many people on the ground to plan, \nmodel, implement, constraint .check, simulate, approve, uplink, and enab~e. If so, \nthey'll end up being more expensive than a set of commands a smaIl operall~ns staff \nuplinks in joystick mode in real time. Fault protection rules onboard c~ reqUIre large \nteams to design and to then analyze the causes and results when they trtgger. The cost \nof programming, ''training'', perfo~ce moniton,ng, an~ lI?uble shooting an intelli-\ngent agent can easily be underestimated. For a given mISSIOn, we can evaluate the \ncostlbenefits of each of the four levels of autonomy in terms of several specific oper-\national cost savings by answering the following questions. \n\nDoes it reduce the number or complexity of tasks that must be performed by ground \noperators? If the net number or complexity of tasks perfo~ed by operations g~s \ndown (after considering the additional operational tasks required to program, mam-\ntain, analyze, and trouble shoot the autonomy), then spacecraft autonomy can be \njustified in terms of ops cost savings. \n\nDoes it allow an increase in the time between spacecraft contacts? How long a \nspacecraft can go routinely unattended can depend heavil~ on the.amount of on~oa:d \nautonomy. The longer a spacecraft can go without ground mteracllon the more sIgmf-\nicant staffing cost savings may be by enabling single-shift rather than around the clock \noperations. The plan for the Pluto Express spacecraft during its nine year cruise to \nPluto, is to have lights out operations (i.e., no activity) for 12 out of eve:t 14 days. \n\nDoes it reduce the number of commands that we must routinely uplink? A space-\ncraft that can expand commands on board, use a high-order command language, or \nrespond to goal-oriented commands can be cheaper to operate than a spacecraft that \nmust be controlled by primitive, device level commands. \n\nDoes it reduce the amount of engineering and performance data that we must rou-\ntinely downlink, process, and analyze on the ground? Spacecraft designed to do their \nown onboard monitoring, trending, compressing, summarizing, and archiving of engi-\nneering data can substantially reduce communication costs as well as the quantity of \ndata that operations must deal with on the ground. Remember that spacecraft autono-\nmy can add its oWn performance data to the set that must be routinely downlinked to \n\n\n\nIi \n'I \n\nI \n\n1 \n\n\u00b71 \n\n618 Mission Operations \n\nthe ground. The Pluto Express spacecraft is being designed to downlink only about 2% \nof the total engineering data that it will collect during cruise. The 98% that won't be \nroutinely downlinked will be stored on the spacecraft in an onboard engineering data \narchive ~d will be downlinked only in the event of a spacecraft perfonnance anomaly. \n\nDoes It reduce the amount of payload data that we must routinely downlink, \nprocess, and analyze on the ground? Thi~ ~uestion suggests that all things being equal, \npayload autonomy can reduce ops costs if It returns fewer telemetry bits while accODl-\nplishing the. same mission goal. For FireSat, the least autonomous mode is to return aD \nthe data being captured by the payload sensor. A more autonomous mode would be to \nhave the sPacecraft decide when it was over the ocean and omit that data. An even \nmore autonomous mode would include onboard detection of fires, and the data down-\nlinked would be only the fire's location and extent. \n\nEach mission will have different answers to these autonomy questions. You must \nanalyze each mission's cost vs. benefit in deciding what spacecraft autonomy capabil-\nities make sense. Autonomy can require additional spacecraft resources such as mass \npower, memory, MIPS and data bus bandwidth, and the cost of these must be account~ \ned for. Developing, testing, and validating flight software isn't cheap. You must \ncompare cost increases for development and maintenance with operational cost sav-\nings. This trade may not be favorable for short missions or single spacecraft but may \nhave high payoff for long duration missions or constellations. The cost lind aVailability \nof space communication services and for transporting and managing data on the \nground can also influence autonomy decisions. \n\nReferences \n\nBloch, J., et al. 1994.

Table 15-1 summarizes these ''functions'' and corresponding \noptions. \n\nTo support spacecraft and their payloads, the ground system must command and \ncontrol them, monitor their health, track them to determine orbital position, and deter-\nmine spacecraft attitude from sensor information. The ground system controls the \nspacecraft and its instruments or payloads by transmitting command data to the space-\ncraft. Except for passive echo tracking techniques such as radar or laser reflector, the \nground system uses spacecraft housekeeping telemetry and mission data to carry out \nthese functions. For example, the ground system may use instrument data from a \nspaceborne radar altimeter to refme knowledge of the SP!lcecraft's orbit. \n\nGround stations acquire mission data from a spacecraft and its instruments and \ntransfer it to the data users. The ground system also supplies any telemetry and track-\ning information the data users may need. Most space missions allow the user's \nevolving requirements to influence changes in the ground system's data relay and \ncontrol functions. \n\nGround systems consist of ground stations and control centers working together to \nsupport the spacecraft and the data user.

Relation Between Space Segment, Ground System, and Data Users. Data users \ninfluence a mission by requesting commands through the ground system. \n\nrequests from the data user to the control centers. Except for communications \nsatellites, * users do not send commands independently to the spacecraft, because its \noverall health depends heavily on the state of individual instruments and systems. \n\nThe ground system tries to provide highly available, high-fidelity access to the \nspacecraft while remaining transparent to both data users and ground controllers. In \npractice though, we must trade off transparency and cost For example, we may accept \nsome distortion or loss of mission data, as well as time delays between the spacecraft \nand the data users. These delays may range from subseconds to seconds for real-time \ndata transfer, and from days to weeks for recorded data. In supporting the spacecraft \nand payload, we may need to balance length and number of opportUnities to command \nor monitor the spacecraft with the risk inherent in being out of communication. \n\nBecause more complex ground systems are less transparent, we must design them \nas simply as possible, consistent with mission requirements. When designing a space \nmission, we should trade off space segment and ground system complexity through \nseveral iterations, until we produce best performance at lowest cost (see Cbaps_ 3 \nand 4). \n\n15.1 The Ground System Design Process \n\nTable 15-2 summarizes the ground system design process and references discus-\nsions pertaining to each step. This process is iterative because the steps interrelate and \nwe must strike a balance in complexity between the spacecraft and the ground system. \nEach iteration must address: \n\n\u2022 Ground station locations, based on spacecraft coverage and data user needs, \nbalanced against cost, accessibility, and available communications.

Mission elements control the space segment or handle mission data. Facility \nelements support or are otherwise ancillary to mission elements. Both contain mixes \nof various hardware, ftrmware, and software. (In this chapter, I will use the most com-\nmon names and acronyms.) The ground system staff uses and coordinates the \noperation of the physical components. Mission operations, discussed in Chap. 14, \ncoordinates activities for the ground system and command and control of the \nspacecraft. \n\nThe ground station is the Earth-based point of communication with the space \nsegment for control and, typically, user data. Figure 15-3 shows the basic ground \nstation, which consists of the following components. \n\nThe single antenna system includes the antenna and mount, its associated electro-\nmechanical actuators, the consoles and servo circuitry which control the antenna, and \nthe feeds and transmission lines which carry RF signals to and from the RF equipment. \nThe antenna, along with the receive RF equipment, satisfies the required receive Off \nat the frequency of the downlink carrier. It also works with the transmit RF equipment \nto provide the required EIRP at the uplink carrier frequency. Chapter 13 discusses \nthese communications links.

This figure displays only the minim'um components \nneeded to control a spacecraft and relay mission data to users. \n\nby the mission. For low-Earth orbit, these can cover essentially all of the visible \nhemisphere. It must also provide the required steering modes, such as programmed \ncomputer steering and autotracking. Autotracldng refers to the use of the received \nspacecraft signal itself to steer the antenna. In this case, the antenna system usually \nprovides continuous pointing coordinates to the tracking component at the ground \nstation. \n\nThe receive RF equipment is generally in suites of racks, located to minimize \ntransmission-line losses to the antenna. This equipment accepts the downlink carrier \nfrequency from the antenna system, downconverts it to intermediate frequencies, and \ndemodulates it to baseband signals for the equipment devoted to mission data recovery \nandTI&C. \n\nAlso in racks near the antenna system, the transmit RF equipment accepts tracking \nand command signals from the ground system's Tf&C component and modulates \nthem onto the RF uplink. which it also generates. In the case of communications \nsatellites, it also modulates user data onto an uplink carrier. \n\nAfter the RF receive equipment demodulates the signals, the mission data recovery \nequipment conditions the mission data before relaying it to data users and ground \n\n\n\n626 Ground System Design and Sizing 15.2 \n\nsystem components. It typically has its own location in the system. but it may be \nintermingled with the receive RF suite for simple data streams. \n\nThe data user interface connects the mission data recovery equipment and the data \nuser. If all parts of the ground system and the data user are colocated. this interface \ngenerally consists of no more than manual or electronic patching of the data lines \nbetween the ground station and the user facilities. \n\nThe Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (IT&C) equipment conditions and \ndistributes received telemetry and tracking signals. It also electrically formats, authen-\nticates, and times transmitted command and tracking signals. It usually processes these \ntracking signals and data on th~ .antenna-pointing .angle to inform users about range, \nrange rate, and spacecraft poSItion. TT&C funCtions are usually highly automated \nbecause of the need for speed, timeliness, and accuracy. \n\nThe station control center controls the configuration of, and the interconnects \nbetween, the ground station components. Operating under instructions from the \nground system's mission control center, it keeps the ground station configured to \nsupport mission operations. \n\nGround system operations require time coordination, so one system element \nmaintains a clock precise enough to meet mission requirements; it distributes clock \ntime and reference frequencies to the other system elements (see Fig. 15-4), moving \nthrough the colocated elements of a ground system by wire or cable. It is accurate to \nwithin milliseconds or better. Its usual one-per-second timing pulses are synchronized \nto within a few microseconds or less to a world time scale, such as Universal Time \nCoordinated (UTC).

The System TIming Element. This synchronizes the elements of a ground system by \ndistributing precision time and frequency. \n\nThree types of control centers are generally found within ground systems. The \nSpacecraft Operations Control Center (SOCG) monitors and commands the \nsp~ bus and common systems, as opposed to onboard instruments or payloads, \nwhich are controlled by the POCC, as discussed below. The sacc analyzes spacecraft \ntelemetry and, when necessmy, telemetry and mission data from instruments which \ncan affect the spacecraft's attitude and dynamics. As the only ground system element \nthat directly commands the spacecraft, it coordinates and controls POCC access. \nSpecifically, it approves the POCC's requests to command instruments after consider-\n\n15.2 A Ground System's Basic Elements 6'1.7 \n\ning mission plans and schedules, spacecraft health, and the collective well being of the \nother instruments on board. \n\nFor simple spacecraft, the SOCC also serves as the POCC. On the other hand, we \nay need several sacCs if the space segment is complex. An eXanlple might be one \n\nm\u00b7th several complicated spacecraft requiring intensive and near-continuous monitor-\n~g and control, such as ground systems which provide user services to other missions \n(see Sec: ~5.4). We may ~so need more than one SOCC for backup or for security, \nsurvivability, or other political reasons. \n\nEquipment and people make up the sacCo The hardware includes data monitoring \nequipment and consoles, commanding facilities, ~d associated communications: This \nequipment is usually computer automated for qwck response, but humans may mter-\nvene at any time to control the spacecraft.. . . \n\nThe Payload Operations Control Center (POCG) analyzes telemetry and mISSIon \ndata from onboard payload instruments and issues commands to these instruments. Its \ncommands depend on approval by the mission control center, with coordination from \nthe sacCo Interactive computer equipment also runs the POCC, with people standing \nby during communication with the spacecraft. . . \n\nWe may use multiple POCCS when several onboard lDStruments ~ ~ful \nindependent supervision or when we need a backup for redundancy or sUlVlvability. \nWe may also need or want to place the POCCS for some instruments near the manu-\nfacturer or the data user. \n\nThe Mission Control Center (MCG) plans and operates the entire space missi()n, \nincluding the configuration and scheduling of resources for both space and ground \nsystem. It computes and issues information needed by ground system elements and \ndata users, such as data on the spacecraft's orbit, ground station pass times, and an-\ntenna pointing angles. In simpler systems, we may merge the MCC with the sacCo \n\nMCCs are best placed near the POCCS and SOCCS, but niission requirements or \nother considerations often call for placement elsewhere, thus greatly complicating the \nground system. Location of the MCC depends on security, survivability, and political \nor administrative considerations. Sometimes, redundancy demands several MCCs \n-one as prime and the others as backups. If ground systems provide services to user \nmissions, each user mission will have a dedicated MCC. These MCCs are frequently, \nbut not necessarily, colocated. The host mission MCC may also, but again not neces-\nsarily, be near the user MCCs. \n\nThe software used for MCC and POCC activities is covered in more detail in \nChap. 14. It is worth noting here, however,that there has in recent years become \navailable commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software for integration testing as well as \nmission and payload operations, analysis, and planning, and ground system operation. \nThe best of these packages are very powerful, yet tailorable to a specific spacecraft, \nalleviating the need for a program to develop expensive mission-unique software. \nMost of these offerings are very efficient and versatile, permitting large reductions in \nthe required operations team. \n\nPlant facilities include buildings and grounds, utilities, services for the staff, and \nsecurity. We normally would use commercial utilities with locally generated backup \nfor emergencies. For security and survivability, utilities may be wholly self-contained. \nBecause plants are expensive, we must decide whether to build unique, dedicated \nsystems or to use existing alternative systems (see Sec. 15.4). \n\nAvailability is the percentage of time a ground system is available to support a \nmission. The availitbility we want in a system determines whether maintenance should \n\n\n\n~\n' \n\n'I \n1,1 \n\nIJ' \ni \n\n628 Ground System Design and Sizing 15,2 \n\nuse spare or repair. To achieve high availability often requires hot spares (powered on \nand ready for operation at a moment's notice). \n\nFigure 15-5 shows the physical layout of a simple ground system with its data users \ncolocated, eliminating the need for long-distance communications links between \nthem. Such a system can provide low-coverage support of up to several spacecraft in \nlow-Earth orbit on a timeshared basis, or virtually 100% coverage for a single space-\ncraft in geostationary orbit One of its advantages is that it can be dedicated to a \nparticular mission, thereby eliminating schedule conflicts. Also, it is compact and self \ncontained, allowing all communications between elements to be local and dedicated \nthus simplifying the system's operation and administration. \n\nEJ ~ I ReceIve RF Equipment I I MIssIon Data Recovery EquIpment] RF EquIpment Room MIssIon Data Room Antenna ConIrcl I Transmit RF Equipment I I Data User Interface I Room \nI Telemetry EquIpment I TT&C 1= I Room Data User Room I Tracking EquIp.

A Typical Installation for a Basic Ground System. Depending on the number of \nPOCCs, the total area occupied may be between 100 and 500 m2\u2022 The need for \nsignificant staff services can greatly increase the area for remote Instafiations. See \ntext for discussion. \n\nUnfortunately, this simple ground system also has significant disadvantages. For \nexample, the single ground station provides very low coverage for low-Earth orbit \nspacecraft because a pass (the time period that the spacecraft is in view of a ground \nstation) lasts only a few minutes, and for other than near-equatorial orbits, does not \noccur often. As Sec. 15.5 points out, these conditions prevail because the maximum \nviewing angle of a low-Earth orbit spacecraft from any point on the Earth is 20% or \nless of the orbital path, and for inclinations above 25 or 30 deg, only 25 to 30% of the \norbits are visible. An exception is polar orbits as seen from polar ground stations, \nwhere each orbit is visible. (See Chap. 5 for visibility formulas.) Another limit is the \nsystem's inability to support more than one spacecraft link at a time because of the \nsingle antenna and ground station. Also, the simple system can serve only on-site \nusers. The system's most important disadvantage, however, is its lack of redundancy. \nIf any element were to fail we would lose data, or possibly even a spacecraft. Thus, \nredundant equipment, spares, and maintenance, as well as geographical location, are \nparticularly important To be secure, a completely colocated ground system should be \non domestic soil. Even so, it will not be very survivable, and it will take a long time to \n\n15.3 The Typical Gronnd System 629 \n\nrecover from any major damage. For this reason, the military would generally not want \na simple or basic system. \n\n15.2.1 GEOSAT-A ''Simple'' System \nThough not as \"simple\" as the basic system described above, the GEOSA T' s \n\nground system shown in Fig. 15-6 is a good practical example. It supports only one \nspacecraft with one ground station and colocated components. Launched in the spring \nof 1985, this remote, ocean-sensing spacecraft is supported through an S-band telem-\netry and data downlink, a VHF command uplink, and VHF Doppler beacons for \ntracking. The ground system provides full telemetry, data, and command support of \nthe spacecraft. It is located under one roof at the Johns Hopkins University's Applied \nPhysics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, except for the Doppler tracking equipment in \nthe worldwide system of TRANET Doppler tracking stations. \n\nFigure 15-6 is a functional diagram of the ground system showing in solid lines its \nthree major segments: the satellite test facility, the digital element, and the computer \nsystem. The figure and nomenclature reflect diagrams typically seen in descriptions \nof the GEOSAT ground system. The overlaid dotted boxes show how the functions \nfit into the basic components of a ground system with some functions overlapping. \nFor example, the real-time frame sync and decommutator is involved in operations \nfor both mission data recovery and IT &C, and the computer system supports many of \nthe basic components. Further; as is often the case with simpler ground systems, the \nSOCC, POCC, and MCC are in one unit. Note that we have not yet discussed some of \nthe functions, especially for mission data recovery equipment and the data user \ninterface, which demand more than our simple ground system can provide. \n\n15.3 The Typical Ground System \n\nTo support a realistic space mission, a ground system must usually provide high \ncoverage simultaneously for several spacecraft in various orbits, with high levels of \navailability, security, and, for military missions, survivability. Such a system will \nusually include many elements in several configurations. The realistic system in \nFig. 15-7 includes standard stations and less capable auxiliary stations, which may be \non aircraft, ships, or land. These auxiliary stations fill gaps in coverage, using equip-\nment similar to that of regular stations and providing radar tracking, telemetry, data \nreception, and backup command. \n\nIn a real ground system, we may also employ multiple control centers in separate \nlocations. Thus, as shown, some POCCs are near the SOCC, whereas some are remote. \nIn this generic system, we designate a SOCC as prime, colocate it with a prime MCC, \nand back up both prime centers with remote centers. Multiple control centers are \nredundant, survivable, and flexible, allowing responsibility for prime control to pass \nback and forth between the centers during various phases of the mission. For example, \nwe may make the remote SOCC prime during launch and early checkout of the space \nsegment because it is near the launch or simulation equipment \n\nGeographical dispersion and multiplicity of elements greatly complicate a ground \nsystem's design. For example, each location must usually have its own synchronized \ntiming system, similar to that for the colocated ground system described ~lier. \nFurther, the distributed system requires several physical plants with different admin-\n\n\n\n~! \n!~ \niii \n\\, \n\n'I \n\nI \n! \n\n!' ~ : ., I \n\n630 Ground System DesIgn and Sizing 15.3 \n\n~nm~~on--------------------------------\nI \nI Satellite Test \nI FacHfty \n\nr-\u00b7---\u00b7\u00b7 .. --\u00b7---\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 .. \u00b7\u00b7--\u00b7\u00b7----\u00b7: \ni i \n\nI I I \nI \nJ \n\nI : \n\ni 1 \ni ! \n. --~-~~:------~ \n\nr Rscshm \nI RF \ni Equfpmsnt L_ \n\n- .. ---~-.---.---:----....\" .. \",.\"....-... \nDaIa \n\n::::::z, \n\n!~~~~RealTlme l~ I Playback \nI _.---._-\n\nDigital \nElement \n\nL. _____ .. -... -l----.- .. __ .... _ \n\n-t-----t---t\nI---4J __ =-=0\" .. -l-- __ _ \n\n! \n\nITT&o \niEquipment \n! \n! \n\n! \ni \n[ \n: \n\nI \n! \n\nTmnsm/tRFI \nEquJpmem i \n\n'----.. _------_: \n: \n: \n: ir--......L-.., \n\n!L..-~_..J \n: \n! \n\nI DaIa ~~ _____ .\u2022 ___ \u2022.\u2022 _.j \nTo \n\nUsers \n\nRg.15-6.

Data Is relayed betWeen remote ground \nstations, backup control centers, and data users, by various communication links. \n(See text for discussion of these links.) Umited capability stations often supplement \nstandard stations. \n\nistrative structures, complicated maintenance and logistics networks, and reliable \ncommunications links-all difficult and expensive to implement for remote locations. \nThus that remote tracking station in East Africa, for example, needed to fill a small but \nimportant gap in ground station coverage, may be disproportionately expensive. \n\n15.3.1 Communications Links \n\nGround systems need long-distance communications links of sufficient bandwidth \nbetween their distributed elements and between them and the data users. These links \nmix landline (electrical, terrestrial microwave, and optical) and satellite connections. \nUnless the links are part of the ground system itself, they are usually subscribed to or \nleased. \n\nWe evaluate communications options while determining where to locate the ground \nsystem's components. For example, we may want to place the SOCC or the MCC Ilear \na metropolitan area to take advantage of its telephone system, but we would want to \nplace ground stations in less populated areas to lessen radio-frequency interfereDce. \nYet installing new and dedicated communication facilities in a remote area may be \nquite costly. \n\nAs international, commercial domestic, and military satellite communications have \nbecome more available, we now prefer satellites to provide communications between \nremote ground system elements and data users. Because of their high capacity and \nperfonnance, communications satellites (comsats) link nearly all intercontinental \nelements of ground systems as well as those lying far apart within continents. World-\n\n\n\n632 Ground System Design and Sizing ISJ \n\nwide systems may require more than one \"hop,\" and more than one comsat For \nexample, a ground station located in India might communicate with a SOCC in the \nUnited States by accessing an international satellite through a domestic communica_ \ntions satellite (domsat). Table 15-3 shows several geostationary communications \nsatellites typically used by ground systems with elements around the world In general, \nportions or all of the available transponder bandwidth may be leased. Martin [1984] \nhas summarized the technical details of these satellites, and user information is avail-\nable from the operating agency. A good basic reference on satellite communications \nis Pratt and Bostian [1986]. \n\nEven when using comsats, we may need landlines to connect to the ground termi-\nnals which access the comsats. With many domsats and military communications \nsystems, we may be able to use locally placed comsat terminals with user antennas that \naccess the communication satellite directly. For international satellites, we must \nusually link in to a central ground terminal which accesses the satellite. This link is \nusually some form of landline, normally a leased telephone line with a high data rate. \n\nTo access these communications links, each element requires terminal equipment, \nwhose complexity depends on the type oflink. (Satellite links generally are most com-\nplex.) Domestic satellite links usually include options to build, lease, or buy the \nterminal equipment Military communications systems provide qualified users links \nthrough small local tenninals and centralized communications stations. Unfortunately, \nthe small tenninals often support relatively narrow bandwidths not suitable to relaying \nhigh speed data. \n\nThanks to the recent explosion in the ubiquity and versatility of communications \nproducts for networking, an increasing trend in moving data around a ground system \nis to use the Internet Protocol (IP) family of protocols. Physical connections can range \nfrom common low rate dialup lines to high speed dedicated channels. For low rate \ndata, it is feasible to move data between system elements using real-time IP protocols. \nHigh rate data is generally stored initially at a ground station, and forwarded postpass \nby protocols such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol). With IP connections, the transport \nprotocol may be either TCP or UDP. * Where dialup or dedicated lines are used, so that \nthe potential for data loss is low, the ground system may use UDP, for the increased \ndata efficiency it provides. \n\n15.3.2 Optional Functions \n\nEach element of the typical system may include functions beyond those in the basic \nelements. A good example is the ground station, which can be far more complex than \nthe basic station we examined earlier. These stations may need several antennas to \nsupport more than one RF link or spacecraft at a time. The antennas may have multiple \nfeeds to pennit simultaneous links at different RF frequencies, or polarization di-\nversity to pennit simultaneous multiple links at the same frequency. Multiple RF links \nin tum require more RF and data recovery equipment, with enhanced performance \nneeded to allow higher data rates and more sophisticated modulation techniques. Im-\nproved IT &C equipment pennits increased rates for telemetry and command, more \nprecise tracking, and coverage for several spacecraft at one time. We may also add to \nthe ground station new functions such as simulation and verification systems. \n\n* TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides a degree of assured data delivery, and adds \noverhead to the data transfer. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) uses less overhead but provides \nno assurance of delivery of any packet of data. \n\n15.3 The Typical Ground System 633 \n\nTABLE 15-3.

The user \ninterface must have versatile switching and interconnection options and connect to \nlong-distance communications links. We may need to add data-handling equipment to \ndistribute received data to different users. Data handling includes all processing of \nmission data between the ground station's data recovery equipment and the data user's \ncommunications interface. Sklar [1988] has rigorously defined various data handling \noperations, but I\u00b7 will summarize the most common functions in the following \nparagraphs. \n\n\n\n~ \nI \n\nI \ni. \n; \n\n[ \n\n634 Ground System Design and Sizing 15.3 \n\nDemultiplexing refers to the disassembly of composite data streams received from \nspacecraft into selected component data streams for routing to different users. With \nmultiple POCCs, and possibly with multiple SOCCs, telemetry data also may require \ndemultiplexing. \n\nClassified or otherwise secure data from spacecraft is often encrypted on board \nbefore transmitting it to the ground where it is decrypted. The data then either flows to \nits users directly, without decryption, or it is decrypted before distribution preparatory \nto demultiplexing or other data-handling\"operations. Of course, some data may be re-\nencrypted before transmission to some users. To prevent unauthorized commanding \nby others, command data is often encrypted as well. .. . \n\nWe may apply encoding, a technique which decreases errors in digital data because \nof noise, to data streams from spacecraft. We may decode this received data in the \nground system and possibly reencode it before distribution. Command data is fre-\nquently encoded to ensure the spacecraft receives error-free commands. \n\nData compression refers to the increase in the infonnation capacity of a data stream \nto permit delivering its infonnation through a narrower band communications channel \nthan would otherwise be possible. Alternatively, a compressed data stream can trans-\nmit more information over a given bandwidth medium. This technique permits us to \ncombine one or more data streams into a composite data stream (that is, multiplexing, \nthe reverse of the demultiplexing described earlier), and distribute it over a com-\nmunications link which could not handle uncompressed data: We can also use \ndata compression for a ground system with limited storage and to distribute received \ndata more quickly. \n\nTimetagging means adding timing infonnation to data streams. If data is not time-\ntagged at the spacecraft, either the ground station or the data-handling equipment may \napply time information to it before recording it or distributing it to users. Usually, we \nwould add an epoch time reference to the data stream in one of several ways. We could \nreference it to the station timing system, by giving the time at which data was received \nat the ground station, with at least first-order corrections for known equipment delays. \nWith more sophisticated systems, we could continuously correct the epoch with orbital \ninformation to estimate the actual time the spacecraft generated the data. To interpo-\nlate the timing of data between epochs, we can use the data clock itself as a time scale \n(for synchronous data only). \n\nInstead of routing received data to users immediately, we may wish to record all or \nsome of it, referred to as data storage, and transmit it later. Also, we may avoid wide-\nband communications links by first recording higher rate data and then transmitting it \nto users at lower playback rates. In all cases, storage protects against loss of data \nduring distribution. Magnetic tape has been the storage medium of choice, but optical \nstorage may eventually supersede it for very large amounts of data. \n\nData quality monitoring means examining the quality of the space-to-ground data \nlink by checking predictable groups of bits or waveforms in the received spacecraft \ndata stream. For example, with synchronous digital data, we can use frame-synchroni-\nzation words to count the bit error rate and make sure the link is working properly. In \nthis way, we can monitor all parts of the ground system used to relay mission data. \n\nThese data-handling operations may take place anywhere in the ground system. For \nsmall systems with only one or two ground stations, we would typically handle the \ndata within the ground station, and transmit it directly to the user. In doing so, we can \nreduce bandwidths in communications links to users by separating high-rate compos-\nite data streams into their components and compressing the data at the ground station. \n\n15.3 The Typical Ground System 635 \n\nWe can also control data security, preserve signal-ta-noise quality in the data stream, \nand suppress accumulated distortions by processing data as quickly as possible after \nreceiving and demodulating it The ground station usually stores and timetags data as \nwell because mission data has the smallest delay uncertainties there. \n\nAlthough the ground station usually does the data-handling tasks best, a system \nwith several ground stations would need links between each of the ground stations and \neach of the users to transfer the data-an impractical if not impossible arrangement \nThus, ground stations often transfer da~ ~tly to a central f~ty (the SOCC for \nexample), handling only selected operations, such as recording, the~lves. The \ncentral facility passes the data on to the users. This procedure minimIzes ground \nstation hardware, centralizes control, and gives more flexible service to data users. It \nusually requires dedicated communications links between the ground stations and the \ncentral facility, which can support higher data rates than might otherwise be necessary. \n\nSimulation/Verijication (SimlVer) systems test the ground system's readiness using \nrealistic simulated signals and data. Tests may be at routine intervals, during prepass \nor postpass, or following system maintenance or upgrade. SimNer also provides diag-\nnostics for troubleshooting and calibrates equipment When fully implemented. a \nSiroN er system not only can test individual ground system elements and components, \nbut also can perform highly automated end-ta-end tests of the entire ground system. \nBut this type of SimNer system is expensive, employed only within elements whose \navailability is critical. \n\n15.3.3 Intluence of Spacecraft Autouomy \nSpacecraft autonomy could potentially simplify the tasks of !he SOCC, POCC; and \n\nrr&C elements of the ground system. But unpredictable spacecraft upsets and \nmalfunctions, including those in the autonomous systems themselves, will force us to \nuse ground elements at the same level for some time. For example, onboard clocks \nmay timetag data as it is generated, but the ground system's ability to timetag received \ndata will probably be retained as a backup for the foreseeable future. \n\n15.3.4 The DMSP Example System \nThe Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is an example of a typical \n\ndistributed ground system. Using remote-sensing satellites in low-Earth orbit, it pr0-\nvides the Department of Defense important environmental information. Figure 15-8 \nshows its main elements. The spacecraft links are at L-band (1,750 to 1,850 MHz) for \nthe uplink and S-band (2,200 to 2,300 MHz) for the downlink. Data rates for these \nlinks are 2 kbps (command) and 1,024 kbps (mission data), respectively. The DMSP \ngrotmd stations are referred to as Command Readout Stations (CRS). They are supple-\nmented by the Automated Remote Tracking Stations of the Air Force Satellite Control \nNetwork's (AFSCN) ground system. \n\nMission data is transferred from ground stations to DMSP central facilities by \ndomestic satellite and landlines. The data is then relayed by similar communications \nlinks to the large data processing users, the Navy oceanographic, and Air Force \nweather forecasting centers. This system also is an example of a mission in which \nsome data users receive mission data directly from the spacecraft. Shipboard and trans-\nportable landbased terminals throughout the world receive data on local environmental \nconditions directly for immediate use. \n\nWe might also note that with the current trend for commercial satellites which \nprovide imaging and other forms of remote sensing, advances in receiver technology \n\n\n\nGround System Design and Sizing \n\nI~I \nMonIeroy.

It uses landlines and domsats to connect various ground \nstations to control centers and central facilities and for relay of data to large military \ndata processing centers. Shipboard and mobile terminals receive data directJy from \nthe DMSP satellite. \n\nand commercial processing software are now permitting private users to receive such \ndata directly from these satellites at reasonable cost. \n\n15.4 Alternatives To Building a Dedicated System \n\nInstead of building a dedicated system, we can use existing ground support \nnetworks to supply part or all of the elements needed. A number of commercial and \nmilitary ground systems can handle more than one mission and are available to support \nuser missions. In this service-provided arrangement, the host ground system provides \nmost of the elements of the users ground system. Blit these existing configurations \ncannot satisfy all possible missions, so host systems are usually tailored to particular \nkinds. Where necessary, a user mission may have to provide some special equipment, \nbut they can reduce the amount by designing missions to match the host's configura-\ntion wherever possible. In fact, users must usually meet severe constraints to make \ntheir missions compatible with the host system and other user missions. \n\nNormally, full-service host systems provide all necessary elements of the ground \nsystem, which all users share. Major communication links connect ground stations to \na central facility which houses the user mission's poces, soces and MCC. Either \nthe host or the user mission may supply the equipment and personnel for these centers. \nThe central facility probably also contains the host's SOCC and perhaps, the prime or \nbackupMCC. \n\n15.4 Alternatives To BuDding a Dedicated System 637 \n\nUse of service-provided ground systems may follow a hybrid arrangement, \nombining some dedicated elements from the user mission with others from one or \n~re host systems. Actually, most service-provided systems require some ground \nsystem construction and some significant elements, or parts of elements, from the user \nmission. \n\nThese alternative systems have some important advantages over dedicated ones. \nFor example, they usually save a lot of money and have a defined and predictable cost \nschedUle. Another advantage is high, predictable reliability and availability. Although \nnot necessarilY designed for it, most are highly survivable because they have many \ndispersed assets on the ground, making them important for military missions. \n\nAlternative systems also have disadvantages. For example, matching the user \nmission with the system may make the overall mission less effective. Sharing host \nresources with other supported missions also demands coordination of activities and \npriorities, based on such things as the supported mission's relative importance, criti-\ncality of particular events, and the amount of control the host has over the ground \nassets. Contractual negotiations usually determine these priority agreements. \n\nTo evaluate potential alternatives to dedicated systems, we must begin by defining \nthe requirements for key mission parameters and then matching them against the \ncandidate host systems. As with a dedicated system, we would try to adapt the require-\nments to the host whenever possible through studies and discussions between planners \nof mission and host systems. To be efficient, we should evaluate all potential host sys-\ntems at the same time. Further, if possible, we shoUld examine service-provided \nsystems while developing the preliminary design of a dedicated system, if we are \nconsidering one. The [mal configuration of our ground system woUld therefore be \nbased on the best possible information. \n\nIn evaluating service-provided ground systems, we must determine how much \nusers must tailor their missions, how much equipment users must provide, and how \nmuch access users have to ground stations or central distribution points. We would \nalso need to consider the loading, lifetime, and upgrades planned for host systems. \nAnother important comparison is between the well defined leasing costs of the host \nsystem, and the cost of building and maintaining a dedicated system, both evaluated \nover the mission's lifetime. \n\n15.4.1 The Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) \n\nAn example of a service-provided ground system is the Air Force Satellite Control \nNetwork, AFSCN, a major ground system operated by the United States Air Force. It \nhas 8 ground stations, called Automated Remote Tracking Stations (RTS), located \nthroughout the world. Six of these are dual stations, able to support 2 spacecraft simUl- . \ntaneously. These stations communicate with 2 central facilities or nodes, called the \nConsolidated Space Test Center (CSTC) in Sunnyvale, California, and the Consolidat-\ned Space Operations Center (CSOC) at Falcon Air Force Base, Colorado, through an \narray of ground links and communications satellites, including DSCS, GE, and Intel-\nsat Each user mission's SOCC, POCC, and MCC are generally combined into a single \nMCC at one of the central nodes, with facilities including computers and software for \nboth operations and planning. \n\nTable 15-4 lists locations and key parameters for the AFSCN stations. To support \nspacecraft links, each station has 18 m and 14 m parabolic antennas, with RF and data-\nhandling equipment for IT &C and mission data. The system of RF links with \n\n\n\n~ \n!I \n\n, i \nI \n\n638 Ground System DesIgn and Sizing 15.4 \n\nspacecraft is known as the S-band Space-Ground Link Subsystem (SGIS).\" The down_ \nlinks provide telemetry and mission data rates (signaling bit rates) up to 1.024 Mbps \nThe ~links permit command rates of 2 kbps. Most RTSs also support non-SGtS \ndownlinks at data rates up to 5 Mbps. The network has strong antijam and SurviVal \ncapabilities. \n\nTABLE 15-4. AFSCN Ground StaUons.

Uplink, or \ncommand channels, are in the 1,750 to 1,850 MHz range, and downlink channels are from \n2,200 to 2,300 MHz. Each channel consists of a single uplink carrier and two downlink \ncarriers which can be received simultaneously by an RTS to provide range and range rate, \nspacecraft telemetry, and mission data. \n\n15.4 Alternatives To .Building a Dedicated System 639 \n\n15.4.2 NASA Tracking and \nData Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) \n\nAlthough it is not literally a ground support network. the TDRSS is the current \nsupport system for NASA satellites. Becoming operational in the mid-1980s, it \nreplaced most of the Ground Space Tracking and Data Network. With its constellation \nof 3 geosynchronous relay satellites, the system can support up to 20 subsynchronous \nsatellites with multiple-access S-band links, and two each single-access links at \nS-band and at Ku-band. The multiple-access links support satellites simultaneously at \nfixed frequencies of 2,106.4 MHz for the forward or command link (uplink) and \n2,287.5 MHz for the return or downlink. The S-band single-access link supports one \nspacecraft at a time, with a frequency between 2,025 and 2,120 MHz for the forward \npath and between 2,200 and 2,300 MHz for the return path. Ku-band frequencies are \n13.775 GHz forward and 15.003 GHz return. \n\nThe multiple-access links support spacecraft at lower data rates for extended \nperiods. They use electronic beam forming by the TDRSS and signal separation by \npseudorandom noise codes to discriminate between spacecraft. The single-access links \nprovide users high data rates for short periods. With any of these links, the relay satel-\nlites pass signals between the user spacecraft and a single ground station located at \nWhite Sands, New Mexico. The system provides full TI&C and mission data, but the \nuser spacecraft must match standard communications requirements and have standard \nIT&C hardware on board. \n\nFigures 15-9 and 15-10 show the communications system perfonnance required of \nuser spacecraft. Figure 15-9 gives the spacecraft receiver Grr required for the forward \n(command) link to yield a bit error rate of 10-5\u2022 Figure 15-10 illustrates how much \nE1RP a user spacecraft return link must have for the same bit error rate of mos. In \nFig. 15-10, \"Power Received\" refers to the power (in dBW) in the return signal at the \nTDRS spacecraft without the gain of the TDRSS receive antenna. In other words, it is \nthe power in dBW of the user spacecraft's return signal after the space and absorption \nlosses descn\"bed in Chap. 13 are added to the user spacecraft's EIRP. ''Encoded data\" \nrefers to data convolutionally encoded at rate 112. (See Sec. 13.3.3.) The user space-\ncraft's signal power received at the TDRS must be on the curves ofFig.15-10 to reach \nthe Achievable Data Rate. Multiple access users must not exceed the curve by more \nthan 3 dB-and then only by arrangement with the TDRSS. For both figures, the \nextent of the curve shows the permitted range of data rates. \n\nThe TDRSS ground station acts as a bent pipe for user command, telemetry, and \nmission data. It accepts previously formatted command data and routes telemetry and \nmission data to the user mission's POCC, SOCC, and MCC through the NASA \nNASCOM communications network. Although the TDRSS does not supply control \ncenters for user missions, we can arrange to use standardized control centers (referred \nto by NASA as POCCs) at either Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Mary-\nland, or at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. (These poces essentially \ncombine the ground system's three basic control centers.) A mission may also have \nunique control centers remote from the NASA sites, but it must provide the required \ncommunications links with the NASCOM nodes at these sites. \n\nTechnical details and information on contracting to use the TDRSS are available in \na NASA document [Goddard Space Flight Center, 1984, as revised]. To learn more \nabout how to use the TDRSS, contact the Project Manager for Space Network, Code \n452, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. \n\n\n\n640 Ground System Design and Sizing \n\n20r------r------r-----~----~~----~~ \n\n10r------t------+-----~------_6~----~_J \n\nm O~----_t------~----~~----~------+_~ :s.

The earliest of these ground systems, ex-\npected to be in operation in the late '90s, are fairly small, with initial assets consisting \nof twO to four ground station sites and a central facility for control of the ground \nstations and for command, telemetry, and scheduling interfaces to the user. The ground \nstations are usually located at either or both low latitudes for spacecraft with low \ninclinations, and at very high latitudes, for polar orbiting spacecraft. The operators of \nsome of these systems plan on providing links to government-owned or other private \nassets in the future. \n\nInitially planned to provide services for scientific satellites, these commercial \nsystelDS currently offer a mix of S-band and X-band downlink and S-band uplink \nservices between the spacecraft and groundstation. The S-band downlinks provide \nhousekeeping and payload data rates up to 10 or 15 MHz. Data rates to 150 MHz are \nserved by the X-band downlinks. Uplink (command) data rates generally reach to \n1 MHz. Ku-band operations are planned for the near future to accommodate the very \nhigh data rates of remote sensing spacecraft. These systems support both traditional \nTDM (Time Division Multiplexed) and CCSDS (Consultative Committee For Space \nData Systems) spacecraft telemetry formats. \n\nAs a spacecraft program we might contract to use only the ground stations of one \nof these commercial ground systems. However, going beyond providing merely \nTf&C services, these private ground systems anticipate being able eventually to pro-\nvide a full range of optional services including mission operations. After initial fixed \ncharges, the costs of using these systems will be based principally upon use, generally \ncalculated on a \"per pass\" basis. It is generally expected that these systems will serve \nnot only the private space industry, but that Government agencies such as NASA will \nturn to them as well. \n\nThe user's primary communications with these commercial ground systems for \ncommand, telemetry, and scheduling are usually via Internet Protocol (lP). Physical \nconnections can range from common low rate dialup lines to high speed dedicated \nlines. When using dialup or dedicated lines, where data security and delays are not \nserious problems, the ground system user may use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) \nfor efficiency. It is even feasible for spacecraft with low to medium downlink data \nrates, and where security and data latency for both command and telemetry are not \ncritical, that the user's link with the ground system may simply be through the ubiqui-\ntous Internet \"cloud.\" (It is advisable to use TCP here however, since even though it \nmay slow down the average dataflow rate, it provides much more assurance that no \ndata will be lost.) The transfer of high-rate spacecraft telemetry is generally stored \nlocally at the station and transferred postpass by an efficient network protocol such as \nFfP, or shipped on a high density digital medium. Commanding may be either real \ntime or store-and-forward at the system's central facility. \n\nTwo such commercial offerings are Universal Spacenet's Commercial Ground \nNetwork (CGN) and the Ground Network System (GNS) being developed by Allied \nSignal Technical Service Corporation. Spacenet plans to have X- and S-band stations \nin Alaska and Hawaii by 1999. Information on the use of the CGN is available from \nUniversal Spacenet, 417 Caredean Drive, Suite A, Horsham, PA 19044. By the year \n2000, Allied Signal will initially offer high latitude S- and X-Band stations in Green-\nland, Alaska, and Norway. Subsequent lower latitude stations, as well as ties to other \nexisting stations are planned. Information on the GNS can be obtained from Allied \nSignal Technical Services Corporation, PO Box 5555, One Bendix Road, Columbia, \nMD21045. \n\n\n\n642 Ground System Design and Sizing IS.s \n\n15.5 Key Design Considerations \nTwo key conSiderations in ground system design are the coverage required per \n\nspacecraft aDd the number, locations, and vanety of data users. Together, they \ndetermine the number, location, and complexity of ground stations, of POCCS and \nSOCCS, and of the links which provide communications between the various system \nelements and data users. \n\n15.5.1 Coverage Required per Spacecraft \nThe coverage required per spacecraft largely determines the number of ground \n\nantennas and ground stations necessary to support a mission. Coverage refers to how \nfrequently and for what percentage of time a spacecraft must communicate with the \nground system. For geostationary orbits, a single ground station can provide virtually \ncontinuous coverage. But low-Earth orbits may require many ground stations because \neach station has a limited time of view. This time limitation is described in Sec. 53 in \nwhich the time that the example satellite is in view of a ground station is calculated to \nbe 12.3 min. Note that this is almost the maximum viewing time because this is nearly \nan overhead pass. The average viewing time will be considerably less than 12 min. \n\nThese short viewing times severely limit the time ground stations have to send com-\nmands to ;md receive data from spacecraft. Consequently, the data rates employed for \nthese signals will depend on the amount of data to be transmitted during a pass. Most \nmissions need only small amounts of command data and housekeeping telemetry, \npermitting low 'IT&C data rates, typically not more than a few kilobits per second \nUsually, only a few seconds are needed to transmit commands. But we must often \ndump stored mission data to a ground station at high rates to transfer all the data in the \navailable viewing time. Thus, limited ground station view times can create the most \nsevere requirements on the performance of the space-to-ground communications link. \n\nWe can understand this requirement for high data rates for dumped data by assum-\ning that the example spacecraft produces and stores on-board mission data at a 1 Mbps \nrate (a moderate rate for an Earth sensing spacecraft), for dump to the station once per \norbit The required rate for dumping data is the ratio of total stored data to available \ndump time of 12.3 minutes: \n\n(l05minxlxl0\n6 \n\nbps) = 8.54 x 106 bps \n12.3 min (15-1) \n\nThis is a rather high data rate. For any shorter viewing time, the rate will be even \nhigher, requiring more performance of the space-to-ground link. \n\nWe can reduce this rate only by having enough stations symmetrically about the \nEarth to ensure a total dump time of more than 12.3 min per orbit This would require \nmany stations. Having only a few stations also increases the amount of data which \nmust be stored on board, requiring more storage capacity to prevent loss of data from \noverl1ow. And, as we have seen, more stored data requires even higher dump rates to \na limited number of ground stations. \n\nHaving only a few ground stations also significantly reduces spacecraft coverage \nfor 'IT &C and for receiving mission data transmitted in real time. Because the \namounts of data per pass are usually small, pass duration is not of much concern for \n'IT&C. However, a mission's need for frequent 'IT&C contact, the lack of onboard \ncommand storage (spacecraft autonomy), and the requirement to receive real-time \nmission data typically demand more ground stations. \n\nIS.s Key Design CoDSideratioDS 643 \n\nA dedicated ground system usually cannot have many symmetrically distnbuted \nground stations, but we can increase their number by using hybrid configurations of \nvarious service-provided systems. In all cases, we must trade off the number- of \ncontacts needed with the spacecraft against the limited number of possible ground \nstations and the severe geographical and political restraints on their location. \n\n15.5.2 Number, Locations, and Variety or Data Users \nThe data users' requirements determine the complexity of distribution systems. \n\nData users frequently need different portions of spacecraft data streams with different \nrequirements for handling, so data ~dling ~ust be efficient and flexible. A typ~cal \napproach is to sketch out the processmg functions needed to supply data to users m a \nblock diagram. The input to each diagram is the data stream from the data recovery \nequipment We trace the data through each block, branch off the points where each \nuser's data is available, and indicate any further handling or processing. We also show \ndata rates at the input and output of each block. The final rate of the data stream to be \nsent to each user determines the bandwidth of the communication link. \n\nFigure 15-11 shows the processing which might be applied to data from a scientific \nspacecraft. with data from the three onboard instruments combined into ~e data \nstream for transmission to the ground. We assume that three data users eXist, each \nreceiving all of the data from a particular instrument and \"quick look\" data-particu-\nlar words-from each of the other instruments' data streams. For each user, the figure \nshows the data-handling functions and the rate at which the communication link must \nsend data. Once we have selected the appropriate block diagram, we can fill in details \nat higher design levels. \n\nMIssIon IlaIa \n\nFig. 15-11. \n\n314kbps Tollala \n\nu.er_ \n218kbps \n\nI~H-F..==-\n218kbps \n\nAn Example of a Block Diagram for Data Handling. Composite data streams from \na spacecraft must often be separated and recombined for relay to different users. \nThe required communications Onk capacity may be seen explicitly. See text for \ndiscussion. \n\nThe users' location and variety also determine whether the individual ground \nstations or the central facility handles the data. Again, we must trade off the number, \nbandwidth, and complexity of the required data links against costs for procuring and \n\n\n\n644 Ground System Design and sizing 15.s \n\nmaintaining the handling equipment. For smaller ground systems, it is often best to \nsend data directly from the ground stations but in more complex systems, we usually \nprefer to distribute data from the central facility. \n\nReferences \n\nKlements, H.

On board the \nspacecraft, computers have become an integral part of the overall system, as well as \nbeing part of most spacecraft subsystems. Ground station computer systems are used \nto support daily operations after launch, and may be derived from systems originally \nused for developing and testing space-based elements. Thus, computer systems cross \ntraditional subsystem and organizational boundaries. \n\nIn previous chapters we have described the various spacecraft subsystems. Through \nspacecraft evolution, most subsystems now contain elements of a computer system as \nshown in Fig. 16-2. This means that the computer system resource estimation process \ntakes on a larger scope than in the past. In this chapter we discuss how to generate \ncomputer system resource estimates, refine the computer system requirements, esti-\nmate the effort in terms of resources, and define the tasks associated with developing \ncomputer systems onboard the spacecraft. Additionally, we will briefly examine the \nrequirements for ground-based computer systems throughout the life-cycle develop-\nment process. \n\nAs outlined in Table 16-1, we discuss the iterative process used to estimate \ncomputer resources, based on mission requirements. We will accomplish this by first \ndiscussing the computer system specifications and the task of creating a baseline \ncomputer system from top level requirements.

Our objective is to meet the system and mission requirements. whether the \nresulting system is on the ground. in space. or distributed between the two. As mission \nobjectives expand, we must blend complex hardware and software to meet them. An \nincrease in system complexity leads to an exponential increase in the associated test-\ning. We strive to keep the computer systems simple at the lowest level. while building \nup the capabilities to meet the top-level mission requirements. \n\nThe primary design drivers used to measure our success in optimizing the computer \nsystem design. are shown in Table 16-3. Mission requirements. shown on the left, \ntypically dictate the system-level drivers. shown in the next column.

Through that process, we identify operational modes for the spacecraft \nbus and payload, allocate top-level requirements to the computer system (among other \nspacecraft elements), and define the subsystem interfaces. Defining requirements for \nthe computer system begins with these results. To arrive at a baseline computer \nsystem, we: \n\n1. Allocate mission and system requirements to computer systems, detailing the \ncomputer system requirements \n\n2. Define the computer system's operational modes and states, based on the com-\nputer system requirements \n\n3. Functionally partition and allocate the computational requirements to space or \nground, payload or spacecraft, individual subsystems, and to hardware or \nsoftware \n\n4. Evaluate the internal and external interfaces (analyze data flow), while evaluat-\ning the candidate architectmes iteratively \n\n5. Select the baseline architecture \n\n6. Form the baseline system specification from the architecture, modes and states, \nand system level requirements \n\nThe first four steps typically occur before the System Requirements Review. We \nusually complete steps 5 and 6 by the Preliminary Design Review. \n\n\n\n650 spacecraft Computer Systems 16.1 \n\nRevisiting and iterating between steps occurs frequently because requirements are \noften contradictory, especially in the early design stages. Requirements can also be \nunreasonable or too narrow in scope. For example, if we determine that the star tracker \nmust have a specified level of accuracy on its own to meet pointing or mapping \nrequirements, without synergy that might come from other ACS sensors such as Earth \nsensor or gyro, we might overspecify the star tracker. By using an iterative process, We \ncan correct contradictory computer requirements and question the validity of others. \nAn assumption made by one subsystem to reduce their complexity may increase the \ncomplexity and\" cost for another subsystem dramatically. Often, a compromise \nsolution is needed. \n\n16.1.1 Requirements Definition \n\nAs with all subsystems, poor computer system requirements definition results in an \ninferior product; erroneous requirements are very expensive to correct. (See Kaner \net al. [1993] for more information.) Thus, requirements have high leverage-a small \nimprovement early avoids many problems later [Yick and Ramamoorthy, 1984; \nBoehm, 1984]. Defining system requirements is difficult. subjective, and time \nconsuming. One approach to doing this is to study a set of questions, such as those \nshown in Table 16-4, which will motivate needed trade studies. \n\nTABLE 16-4. An Approach to System Requirements Definition. General questions which we \nask In all aspects of life can be dlrectly applied to computer system requirements \nderivation by evaluating the specmc parameters listed below. (These questions \nare based on work by R. Holmes, S. Jacobs, and R. Lane of TRW.) \n\nQuestions to Ask \n~-\nWhat mUst the system do? \n\nWhy must it be done? \n\nHow can we achieve it and \nwhat are the alternatives? \n\nParemeters to Review \n\nEvaluate and estabrlSh basic functional requirements. \n\nEstablish traceability from functions to mission objectives.

Look for data flow bottlenecks and reallocate \nfunctions to evenly dlstribute the data flow. Review baseline \nblock diagrams for potential holes. \n\nDevelop nonintrusive testing which will ensure that the system \nwill meet mission objectives. Are test points available outside \nthe system for easy \"black-box\" testing? \n\nTo define requirements for a computer system, it is convenient to develop a \ncomputer system state diagram. The state diagram shows valid states of the system \n(such as \"off' or \"initialized\") and the conditions required to achieve them, often \nbased on mission requirements. The computer system states and state transitions must \nbe consistent with its allocated requirements and the mission concept of operation. \n(See Chap. 14.) Figure 16-4 is an example of a simple state diagram for a computer \nsystem, showing the general states and the source of their transitions. On and off are \nthe obvious first choices for system states. Even when a system must be on at all times, \n\n~~ \n;'.1 \n\n16.1 Computer System Specification \n651 \n\nwe should consider having an off state to allow graceful degradation if the system were \nto shut down for some reason. Other states relate to what the system must do and can \ninclude related transitions. For a specific mission and mission requirements we might \nhave several substates in place of one state shown in Fig. 16-4. Or we might not have \na state shown in the figure if it's not applicable to our mission. For example, several \" \nfail-safe conditions will be associated with the error contingency state shown. How-\never, it will be implemented differently for each specific spacecraft based on mission \nrequirements and mission phase. \n\nFig. 16-4. Typical State Transition Diagram for an Onboard Computer System. The state \ndiagram shows the valid states of the system and the concfrtlons needed to achieve \neach state. \n\nWhen developing the state diagram for a spacecraft computer system, we must keep \nin mind implications for the ground system. Complex state transitions influence \nground station software that deals with the spacecraft's limitations and constraints. \nOther organizations which defme the spacecraft and the ground station need to help \ndiagram the states for the spacecraft computer system. \n\nFunctional Partitioning \nFunctional partitioning is a structured methodology which begins with decom-\n\nposing requirements into their lowest functional component and ends in the creation \nof multiple candidate architectures. This method allows us to group similar functions \nin subsystem definitions without unnecessary influence from traditional subsystem or \norganizational boundaries. The processing for a spacecraft system is usually \npartitioned between various processors in space and on the ground. This allocation of \nprocessing or functional partitioning is performed after the major processes have been \ndetermined and estimates of the processing time lines, or at least the time dependen-\ncies, are available. \n\nThe \"top-level considerations which determine where the processing will be \nperformed to meet the system performance requirements (both technical and program-\nmatic) are presented in Table 16-5. \n\n16.1.2 Processing Architecture \nAn architecture is a framework for developing a computer system.

Data architecture addresses the physical structure of the data network or \nbus, as well as the protocol or logical interaction across the bus. A protocol is a set of \nrules for sending data between computers, or between computers and peripherals. The \nhardware architecture defmes the instruction set architecture (ISA) and the functional \nelements that are available in hardware. (For more information on hardware architec-\ntures see Hennessy and Patterson [1995].) Finally, the software architecture defines \nhow the processing instructions execute. Software processing can function as a single \nthread, executing from top to bottom. repetitively, or as scheduled modules, where \nprocessing order is based on major and minor frames. Alternatively, software process-\ning can be event driven, where interrupt service routines preempt normal execution in \na deterministic way when hardware interrupts occur. \n\nTables 16-6 through 16-9 illustrate various system level and data architectures \nwhich we can use in their entirety or combine into a hybrid to meet the mission \nrequirements. Along with a block diagram and brief description of each, a short list of \n\n16.1 Computer System Specification \n6S3 \n\nsitive and negative attributes have been listed in the tables.

We want clean, simple interfaces-a data path is inefficient and slows \ndown the flow if it calls for data to pass through a component without being examined \nor used [Yourdon, 1989]. \n\nAfter partitioning functions, performing trades, evaluating the data architectures, \nand analyzing data flow, we can develop a block diagram fOr the computer system. \nThe system block diagram illustrates how we implement an architecture, showing \ntypes and numbers ?f ~ and networks, including ~opology and J?TOtocol when \nreasonable. It proVIdes a pomt of departure for developmg more detailed software, \nhardware, and interface requirements.

The PC architecture shown here includes the var-\nIous components discussed in the text. The inputs come from the keyboard or mouse \nand can be service either through an interrupt service routine (ISR) or through a poll-\ning scheme. The processing occurs in the CPU and uses the RAM as a \u00b7scratch pad\" \nfor computation. (This formulation is due to S. Glaseman of The Aerospace Corp.) \n\nA personal computer used as a word processor illustrates the different software \narchitectures which we might select, as well as the basic concepts for sizing computer \nsystems and estimating throughput The operator using the word processor will input \ndata from the keyboard. The computer system software might recognize that an input \nhas bee~ made by receiving an interrupt from the keyboard each time a key is stroked. \nAltemati~ely, the computer system software might poll the keyboard at a specified \nrate, lOOking for a keyboard stroke to occur. The first approach illustrates event driven \nsoftware architecture while the second is a scheduled software architecture. When \nusing an event driven approach, we must be sure that we prioritize each event properly \nand def~e carefully the amount of time required to \"service\" the event or interrupt \nWhen USIng a scheduled approach, we must be sure that the internal clock has enough \nresolution to accommodate the various scheduled rates. If the clock is set or reset by \nan external source, we must ensure that all software will continue to operate even with \ndiscontinuities in the time (such as, if time moves backwards when the clock resets). \n\nNow, assume an operator types at most 100 words (600 characters) per minute. We \ncan ~efine 256 unique s~tes ?n a ~ical keyboard, so a byte (8-bits) can represent all \nposstble characters. Multiplymg 8 bits per character by 600 characters Per minute. we \nsee that the system must input data serially (single stream) at 4,800 bits per minute to \nkeep up with the keyboard operator. \n\n16.1 Computer System Specification 657 \n\nLet's assume the computer system must prepare the input data for display. Also \nassume that each character received will require 10 instructions for processing and that \neach full word received will require 100 more computer instructions. We determine \nthe computer's required processing rate by first multiplying the number of characters \nper minute by the computer instructions required per character. Then, we compute the \nproduct of the number of computer instructions per word times the number of words \nper minute. This example yields a processing rate of 16,000 instructions per minute, \nor 267 instructions per second, to prepare the input data stream for display. Now \nassume that each instruction requires five clock cycles to bring the data from memory \nand one more clock cycle for execution. Thus, to keep up with the typist, the CPU must \nprovide at least 96,000 cycles per minute, or 1,600 cycles per second, requiring a clock \nrate of 1.6 kHz. This example illustrates how we can estimate computer throughput \n(instructions per second) and processor speed (cycles per second) requirements. \n\nTo store the input data and transfer the required 8-bit instructions to the CPU for \nprocessing, the computer must transfer data from memory to the CPU at approxi-\nmately 2,216 bits per second (80 bits per second for input data storage and 2,136 bits \nper second for instruction fetch). We can size the memory by assuming the typist \nworks continuously for 24 hours at the top rate. The resulting data would require \n6.9 million bits of storage, plus 880 bits for the 110 instructions. The keyboard \noperator's typing rate limits the memory size requirements. Understanding such \nsystem bottlenecks is one key to defining requirements for computer systems. \n\n16.1.3 Computer System Requirements \nOnce we have identified the top-level requirements, the state diagram with state \n\ntransitions, and a basic system architecture we must evaluate the impact of mission \nrequirements on the baseline computer system. This assessment begins the refinement \nprocess for establishing detailed computer system requirements. Information regard-\ning the selected orbit, expected period of operation, and any high performance \nrequirements such as large field of view with continuous coverage or tight pointing \nand mapping criteria will affect the fidelity of the hardware and software developed \nfor the specific mission. \n\nSeveral mission parameters drive the hardware selection. For example, the orbit we \nselect will defme the radiation environment When we increase the required level of \nfidelity or include a requirement for autonomous operations, we often require a more \ncapable computer system. Either of these conditions can develop if we have to perform \nrapid transitions between differing orbits, or travel to distant targets. These require-\nments may impact software development. More complex requirements lead to more \ncomplex software implementation, which requires a more robust design and more test \ncases to accomplish a desired level of preflight validation. Inadequate requirements \ndefinition may cause cost and schedule risk for both hardware and software, as \nmodifications and last minute changes may be required. \n\nWhen the mission is not as critical or multiple copies of a satellite will perform the \nsame tasks, we can select computer hardware for the mission based on less stringent \nenvironmental testing. Often we can use commercial rather than space-qualified parts. \nAdditionally, as the possibility for achieving unknown states goes down, we may \nreduce the software complexity and the level of preflight testing. As we increase the \nexpected mission life or mission criticality, we should specify the use of more robust \nhardware, specifically space-qualified components and systems. We also increase the \nrisk that software will operate in a manner that was not predetermined, and thus we \nshould do more thorough preflight testing and system validation. \n\n\n\n658 Spacecraft Computer Systems 16.1 16.1 Computer System Specification 659 \n\nWhen we impose high performance requirements on the spacecraft computer \nsystems we also increase the performance requirements of both the hardware and the \nsoftware. High-data rate payloads such as imaging devices or communication \nsubsystems impose the need for higher bandwidth data busses and often increase the \nCPU performance requirements. When we require tight attitude knowledge and \ncontrol, we not only impose a requirement for increased accuracy on the sensors, we . \nalso increase the computational complexity of the software. which in turn affects the \nCPU performance requirements. \n\nWhen we initially establish top-level mission requirements, we create a set of \nbaseline computer system requirements, state transition diagrams, data flow charts, \nand system architectures. We can then perform trade-studies between the costs \nassociated with our mission requirements and the costs associated with the hardware \nand software we selected to meet the mission requirements. Often when we iterate \nbetween the two, compromising when we feel we can on either side, we can reduce the \noverall mission costs. \n\n16.1.4 Baseline Definition Expansion \n\nIf the initial analyses call for onboard processing, we should further partition \nfunctions between hardware, software, and firmware. Firmware is the software which \nresides permanently in nonvolatile memory. It reduces the susceptibility to upset, but \nwe cannot modify it after launch. Certain elements of the system are clearly hardware: \nspace-qualified computers and processors, the data bus, and so on. Software is for \nprocessing algorithms. which may change throughout the spacecraft's lifetime. Soft-\nware typically executes out of random access memory (RAM). However, because \nRAM is susceptible to single-event upsets (Sec. 8.1.4), firmware is often the answer \nfor critical processes such as initiaIization or contingency operations. Fmnware ofteD \nexecutes out of read only memory (ROM) or programmable ROM (PROM) where we \ncan write once or some smail number of times. \n\nWe next evaluate the Instruction Set Architecture, ISA. This is the machine code \nformat used by a specific processor, such as the 80><86 family of processors, 68040, \nRH3000, and MIL-STD-1750A. The ISA defines the software developer's interface to \nthe processor at the lowest level. To evaluate hardware architectures, we examine \ninstruction sets, recognizing advantages and disadvantages of the two basic types: \ngeneral-purpose and custom ISA. The former supports all kinds of processing but with \nonly moderate performance. The latter supports specific algorithms or classes of \nfunctions very well but often supports varying applications poorly. \n\nWe should avoid custom architectures whenever possible because they are risky to \ndevelop, lack software support, and are hard to reprogram. General-purpose architec-\ntures allow us to modify algorithms more easily, but they slow down processing \nbecause they are not designed for a specific algorithm. In special cases, the faster \nspeed of a custom ISA may drive us to select it despite the drawbacks. \n\nIn evaluating candidate software languages, we again have two basic options: \nassembly language and higher-level language. Assembly language contains the basic \nsymbols and expressions used to program a specific computer, and the programmer \nmust thoroughly know the computer being programmed. Higher-level languages, such \nas C, C++, or Ada, also have symbols and expressions, but they provide more sophis-\nticated operations and add a level of abstraction. Assembly language software is more \nefficient and compact than software written in a higher-level language, but it often \ntakes longer to generate. We prefer higher-level languages for maintenance, test-\n\nability, and life-cycle costs. However, cross-compilers are often not available for \ncustom machines, leaving assembly language as the only method of programming. A \ncross-compiler is one which resides on a standard host (such as SUN, DEC, SOl) and \ncreates executable code for the target process (68040, 603e, and 1750A). \n\n16.1.5 Methods for Tolerating Faults \n\nComputer systems occasionally fail during operation. Since we know that this can \nhappen, we can attempt to mitigate the risk by implementing a means of achieving \ngraceful degradation, or fall backs to maintain some functionality. The most common\u00b7 \nare redundancy and distributed processing. \n\nWe use redundancy for flight critical components to assure that required data are \nalways available to the system. We can implement redundancy in several ways: \nduplicate equipment, back-up capability using a different but comparable approach, \nperform the same tasks on the spacecraft and on the ground, use a bus network which \nallows for data to be sent to various applications or users, independently, or cross-strap \nequipment to various potential users. \n\nDistributed processing allows us to allocate software functions to anyone of a \nnumber of processors, depending on either mission phase, hardware availability, or \nsubsystem failure. Each approach has pros and cons as outlined in Table 16-10. \n\nTABLE 16-10. Pros and Cons of Approaches for Providing Software Methods for Tolerat-\nIng Faults. There are many methods for tolerating faults and no one Is neces-\nsarily better than the next. However, when we evaluate our specffic requirements \nagainst the pros and cons listed here, one solution may be more appropriate for \nour mission. (For more information on fault tolerance, see Magnus [1992].) \n\n~------\nRedundancy Distributed Processing \n\n1--:---::----:-:---:---:-\nPROs: Provides backup which Is Identical to PROs: Can reduce the system weight and \n\nthe original. power if the number of systems Is \n\u2022 Does not require additional or optimized. \n\nspecial software to process the data. \u2022 Provides a means of maintaining \n\u2022 Duplicate testing Is straightforward system performance until several \n\nsince the back-up Is Identical. failures have occurred.

We can mitigate this problem by design-\ning special circuitry so that the computer restarts when it is hung in this condition. We \ncan command this circuitry from the ground, or the computer subsystem can activate \nautomatically. In this latter case, we call the circuitry a watchdog timer. The timer \ncounts down from a given predetermined time and will reset the computer when it \nreaches zero. To prevent the reset during normal operations, the computer's operating \nsystem includes a function to reset the timer to its maximwn time on a regular basis. \nThe anomalous computer operation prevents this timer reset so the watchdog timer \nrestarts the computer. The decision to include a watchdog timer usually does not \n\n\n\nSpacecraft Computer Systems 16.2 \n\ndepend on a subsystem trade-off because we have inadequate data on the rates of \noccurrence of this failure mechanism. It is often standard equipment on computers \ndesigned and marketed for space operations. \n\nSpacecraft occasionally have a more serious computer problem in which the fault \nis pennanent and resetting does not solve the problem. The designer must determine \nwhether the reliability of the planned computer design is adequate, as discussed in \nSec. 19.2. If not, we will need to provide a redundant computer and the special cir-\ncuitry needed to switch from the primary to the secondary computer on failure. \n\nWhen we determine that memory may be unusually susceptible to failure, we can \nmitigate risk by partitioning the memory into \"blocks.\" We design memory to consist \nof independent blocks, where the failure of one block does not cause the failure of \nother blocks. In this case, the hardware designer may provide tolerance of failures of \na memory block by creating a physical-ta-logical map of the blocks at boot-up time. \nIf failures are detected during operations, the system can work around bad blocks of \nmemory. This is an example of a system architecture solution to a potential hardware \nproblem. . \n\nAnother redundancy approach is to duplicate critical programs stored in nonvolatile \nm~mory. For instance we often replicate the Start-Up ROM in physically isolated \nsections of nonvolatile memory. If this logic cannot execute, the computer can not run \nthe operating system or the application programs. The rationale for providing this \nsecond version of the start-up ROM is to avoid the effect of such a catastrophic failure \nwithout including a second computer. Note that in this case, we need a hardware \nmechanism, possibly controlled from the ground, to initiate the execution at the sec-\nondary location because the computer is not under software control until the start-up \nprogram executes. \n\nError Detection and Correction (EDAC) circuitry is an example of hardware that \nprovides tolerance of a bit error in a memory word. It is particularly\u00b7 important in the \nmitigation of single event upsets. EDAC corrects a single bit error in a word when it \nreads that word. If an upset has occurred, the EDAC will correct it If a long time \nelapses before the CPU reads the word, a second bit in the same word may be upset \nTo prevent this from happening, the operating system executes a program known as a \nscrubber to read each word of memory. As it reads each word, it \"scrubs\" all the single \nbit errors. The design parameter available to the system engineer is the time between \nscrubs. If the time is too long, uncorrectable second upsets in words are likely to occur. \nIf the time is too short, the scrubbing process will consume too much of the CPUs \nprocessing time. We can determine this necessary scrub time based on the anticipated \nrate of upsets and system probability requirement that a second, uncorrectable, upset \nwill not occur. Table 16-11 provides an example of this calculation. \n\n16.2 Computer Resource Estimation \n\nThe previous sections discussed how we define computer system requirements and \ngenerate a baseline architecture. In this section, we add detail to the baseline. With \nfunctional groups and a system architecture in place, we specify the needed processing \ntasks (in a general sense), determine the data requirements, estimate software size and \nthroughput requirements, and identify computer hardware on which it will execute. \n\nWe use traceability analysis to make sure the requirements are complete. We must \ntrace the computer system's requirements to parent requirements, which come from \nvarious sources. For example, we may derive them from top-level requirements, oper-\n\n16.2 Computer Resource Estimation 661 \n\nTABLE 16-11.

We must also trace the flow of \nrequirements to the components to reduce \"gold-plating.\" Whenever a top-level \nrequirement changes, good traceability allows us to examine the effect of this change \non lower-level requirements and how we meet them. Often, we rethink a change when \nwe see its effects. In any case, traceability allows us to identify all areas where we must \nevaluate the design to incorporate changes. If we flow the requirements properly dur-\ning conceptual design, we can accurately run tests at each level during development \n\n16.2.1 DefIning Processing Tasks \n\nWe document the requirements for processing tasks and system interfaces in Soft-\nware Requirements SpecifIcations and Interface RequirementS Specifications. While \nestablishing requirements for the spacecraft, we defme processing tasks by classifying \nwhat the spacecraft must do. Software for onboard processing falls into four principal \nclasses. \n\nControl system software, such as attitude or orbit determination and control, \nrequires an input stimulus and responds by changing the state of the system. This \nsoftware is often mathematically intensive-requiring high accuracy and strict \ntimeliness. \nSystem management software includes such items as fault detection and \ncorrection, long duration event schedulers (such as reconfiguring the power \nsystem during eclipses), and payload system management Software in this class \nmanages control flow and is therefore logic intensive. Simple instruction sets are \nsufficient for this class because it requires few floating-point computations. \nMission-data software manipulates and compacts large quantities of data as they \nare collected. This function often demands special computer architectures, such \nas signal processors, as well as large storage capacity for collected data. \n\n\n\n662 Spacecraft Computer Systems 16.2 \n\nOperating system software directly manages computer resources and controls \ntheir allocation to spacecraft and mission tasks. This includes basic executive \nfunctions such as scheduling tasks for execution, time management, interrupt \nhandlers, input/output device handlers and managing other peripheral drivers, \ncarrying out diagnostics and built-in tests, and memory fault management All \ncomputer systems must manage these processes. We often consider software for \nthe operating system as overhead to application software. \n\nAfter examining what the computer system must do, we can assess the nature of its \nprocessors and decide whether to use off-the-shelf processors or develop new ones. \nThe same holds for the algorithms. We want to use established, proven algorithms \nbecause new ones involve technical risk, added costs, and a longer implementation \nschedule. Early emphasis on risk assessment and reduction is part of defining process-\ningtasks. \n\n16.2.2 Estimating Software Size and Throughput \n\nWe measure software size by words of memory, and processing time by through-\nput, usually expressed in thousands or millions of instructions per second (KIPS or \nMIPS, respectively). We estimate the size and throughput of onboard software for \nseveral reasons. When we begin defining a computer system, we use the software \nestimates in conjunction with requirements for spare processing to determine how \nmuch computing power we need to perform the mission. During system development, \nwe revise the estimates to make sure hardware capacity is not exceeded. We also use \nsoftware size estimates to estimate cost \n\nProcessor throughput is a function of the instruction set and the clock speed. With \nonly one instruction, a computer's throughput is proportional to clock speed. If it has \ntwo instructions, one (A) requiring two clock cycles and the other (B) requiring seven \ncycles, the computer's throughput also depends on the instruction mix. The instruction \nmix is the proportion in which the software uses the instructions. For example, if the \nsoftware is 60% type A instructions and 40% type B, the throughput available with a \n10 MHz clock is (101[(0.6 '\" 2) + (0.4 '\" 7)]) = 2.5 MIPS. If the mix is reversed, the \nthroughput available is 2.0 MIPs. \n\nWhen we evaluate hardware architectures to determine their ability to meet our \nprocessing needs we use a benchmark program that contains a specified instruction \nmix so that various computers can be compared to a standard measure of performance. \nTypical benchmarks used for evaluating computer resources in space applications are \nshown in Table 16-12. \n\nWhen We select a benchmark it is important that we use one that has a similar \ninstruction mix to the one we expect in our operational flight software. For example, \nif our flight software will be mathematically intensive we could use Khornerstone, \nLinpack, or Whetstone. However, if our flight software focuses on integer math, the \nDhrystone benchmark is a good match. \n\nSystem Requirements Review is the milestone when we formally identify computer \nresource requirements. A good rule of thumb is to set the amount of computer memory \nand throughput at the System Requirements Review at four times the estimate of what \nis needed for software size and throughput. Empirically, initial software size and \nthroughput estimates double from this review to launch because early requirements are \nuncertain, and changes in software are easier to make than changes in hardware during \nlate stages of spacecraft development We also want spare memory and throughput at \n\n16.2 \n\nTABLE 16-12. \n\n\"\"-Benchmark \n\nrahrystone \n\n7{homerstone \n\nunpack \n\nMIPS \n\n~etstone \n\nComputer Resource Estimation 663 \n\nBenchmark Programs Used to Evaluate Computer Performance.

Thus, \nwe need to establish reserve capacity when initially defining requirements. A reason-\nable value for post-launch reserve is 100% spare (equivalent to 50% of machine \ncapacity). \n\nWe should not attempt to use all of the available memory or throughput Asyn-\nchronous processing, such as interrupt handlers, introduces a level of ~c~t>: in \nthroughput. Costs also rise dramatically as we shoe-horn the software mto eXISting \nmemory [Boehm, 1981]. As a rule of thumb, we should use 70% or less of available \nthroughput. \n\nAfter System Requirements Review, we continuously update estimates for soft-\nware size and throughput as requirements solidify. We plot them as reaction curves to \nensure we can detect whether the software is growing too much. Figure 16-7 shows a \ntypical reaction curve for software development, measured as a ~entage. of \nmaximum use. As long as the estimates fall below the curve, no extraordmary action \nis required. When they exceed it, we must pare down the requirements, relax the \nrestriction on reserve capacity, or increase the resources available. \n\nEstimotingResource Needs for Application Software \n\nTable 16-13 lists general categories of application software and estimates for ~ize \nand throughput. It contains typical sizes and throughputs for several types of appbca-\ntion software and is useful during conceptual design. Sizes for initial estimates are in \nwords of memory, which are less sensitive to language choice. Howev~r, cO$ting \nmodels typically use source lines of code (SLOC). Table 16-14 shows typICal expan-\nsion ratios from words of memory to SLOC for various languages.

Processing for star trackers involves \nidentifying stars against a star catalog, which can require extensive data and memory \nresources. Mission-related or payload sensors typically require additional resources, \nwhich we should calculate separately. \n\nThe Attitude Determination and Control category covers various control methods. \nIn kinematic integration, we estimate current attitude by integrating sensed body rates \nusing gyros. Using error determination, we find how far the spacecraft's orientation \nis from that desired. For spin-stabilized spacecraft, we maintain attitude control using \nprecession control. The precession-control size and throughput numbers reflect those \nof a thruster-based system. The thruster control function listed in the table is for a \nthree-axis-stabilized control system using thrusters. Table 16-13 also lists control \nalgorithms using reaction wheels, control moment gyros, and magnetic torquers.

Simple autonomy is for a simple \nsystem which requires little onboard support when not in contact with the ground\u00b7\u00b7 \nstations. Systems will require complex processing if they need extensive management \nof onboard autonomy. \n\nFault detection is closely tied with autonomy. Monitors exist to identify failures or \nadverse conditions in onboard equipment. Size and throughput vary widely depending \non the system. Processing for corrective actions usually depends on tables of pre-\nstored procedures and, therefore, requires considerable data. \n\n16.2 Computer Resource Estimation 665 \n\nTABLE 16-13.

For example, \n\u00b7t may represent, store, optimize, and pack data; drive input or output; .handle \n~xceptions or errors; and interact or interface with other programs, other deVICes, or \nyen other mixed-language programs. The 1/0 handler controls data movement to and \n\n:rom the processor, as well as packing data for any ~pecific interface. Likewise, the \ndevice handler or device driver software manages mterfaces and data between the \nprocessor and any peripheral devices. . \n\nUtilities are software routines which several functions use. For example, different \ncomponents of application software in a single processor might access a set of math-\nematical operations called math utilities. Their size and complexity vary ~tly with \nthe application and its mathematical requirements. If the proc~or prOVides such \nutilities, they are referred to as built-in junctions, ~ is the ~ In the MIL-STD-\n1750A ISA. Hardware specifications define these available functions. \n\nBuilt-in test software provides initial, periodic, or continuous testing for computer \nelements under the control of software or firmware. Diagnostic software not only \nIdentifies faults or failures but also isolates them. We can make it sophisticated \nenough to recover from some of them. For built-in testing and diagnostics, we can \nwrite the software as firmware. The computer vendor may even supply them. If not, \nwe would have to decide whether we need this added reliability, despite the processing \nand cost overhead. \n\nFor preliminary mission design, we recommend the estimation-by-simiIarity \napproach given in Table 16-16 to estimate the size and throughput for embedded soft-\nware in an onboard computer, as well as its size. Another approach, bottoms-up \nestimation, is also discussed in Table 16-16. Both methods are demonstrated in \nSec. 16.3, the FireSat example. For alternative approaches, see Rullo [1980]. \n\n16.2.3 Computer Selection Guidelines \n\nOnce the initial software size estimation process has been completed, we can begin \nidentifying the hardware resources required. We must fmd .a computer system w~ich \nmeets all of our basic needs, as well as the spare allocation, and has the required \nsupport environment Each computer considered must have suitable system software \n(operating system or kernel and built-in functions such as mathematics). \n\nRepresentative space computers are shown in Table 16-17. In almost all cases \nspace computers should be purch~ ra~er than deve!oped to avoid ~aying the \nnonrecurring development costs, and mcurnng schedule nsks. The exceptions are on \nopposite extremes. Large aerospace ~orpora~o~ have all ~e res~~es.required to \ndesign and test a computer for a spectal application. Educational Institutions, on the \nother hand, may make the same choice, not to save money, but because the process \nmeets an educational objective and because reliability requirements are not stringent. \nSuch an institution should verify the onsite availability of the hardware development \nenvironment, particularly a logic analyzer with the ~uired pods. . . \n\nThe frrst performance criterion we can evaluate .IS the computati?n ~te m !dlPS. \nWith Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) this throughput rating IS eqwvaIent \nto 1.5 instructions times the clock cycle, typically expressed in MHz. The processor \nselected must meet the resource estimation we calculated based on the software \nfunctions required to meet the mission objectives. Nearly as important as the \ncomputational rate is the address space available. Each hardware address line can have \ntwo values: a one or a zero. Therefore, N address lines provide 2N distinct addresses. \n\n\n\n6fi8 Spacecraft Computer Systems 16.2 \n\nTABLE 16-16, Software EstImation Process.

The Generic VHSIC \nSpaceborne Computer (GVSC) was developed by the Air Force from the MIL-SID \n1750A, which defines one word as 16 bits, but it has an 8 Mword address space. This \nwas achieved by built-in paging hardware. The GVSC is a special case because the Air \nForce developed it especially for space applications. We may find other exceptions \nas well. \n\nH possible each candidate computer, or its engineering development unit equiva-\nlent, should be bench-marked against the relevant applications. This is rarely done \nbecause of time and lack of availability of the hardware. In the absence of real equip-\nment or software benchmarks, the computer analyst should examine the individual \ninstructions of each candidate and match them against the qualitative aspects of the \ncomputational requirements. For example, the processor we select to support the \nattitude determination and control function will perform many floating point and \ntranscendental function computations. In this case it would be desirable for floating \npoint and trigonometric instructions to be performed in hardware and not in software. \n\n\n\n670 Spacecraft Computer Systems 16.2 \n\nIf the processor is to perform commutation or multiplexing at the bit level, the CPU \nshould have instructions that support such processes. \n\nOn the other hand, the processor we select for control and data handling will need \nto support bulk moves of data. Thus it would be desirable if it had a Direct Memory \nAccess (DMA) command or a block move command. DMA is very valuable for data \nhandling processors with extensive I/O so that the range of data to be moved can be \nspecified and letting the DMA hardware relieve the CPU of moving each word. \n\nIf we determine that several computers can meet the performance needs we outlined \nin the. sOftv:'ar: resource estimation process, a computer's heritage can be a major \nselection cntenon. We often select a computer previously used in space by NASA, \nESA, the DoD, or a major commercial space venture. By starting with computers \nwhich have prior use in space, the major development, qualification testing, and \ndoc:umentation risks and costs will have been borne by the prior programs. However, \nwhIle older space computers are often highly reliable, they are typically more expen-\nsive and less capable. \n\n16.2.4 Integration and Test \nAs Fig. 16-8 shows, testing usually begins at the lowest level and builds incremen-\n\ntally. By buil~g our test scenarios from the bottom up, we can reduce the complexity \nand thus the nsk. Testing must be rigorous at aU stages from the unit level to the system \nlevel (Kaner et al. [1993)). Software and hardware testing follow the same general \npath, with the subsystem resulting when we integrate the hardware and software. At \n~s level, we test the entire computer system. Finally, we test the whole spacecraft, \nWith computer systems becoming components of the subsystem as described in \nChap. 12. Unfortunately, we cannot determine whether we have calibrated the \ncomputer equipment properly until it is in orbit. Once operational, the system needs \ngeneral testing to ensure it continues to perform as required. Just as acceptance test \nprocedures or inspections check systems for damage on delivery, retesting on-orbit \nchecks for damage during launch. This testing is often referred to as on-orbit check-\nout and calibration. \n\nIn general, integration and test pulls disciplines and subsystems into a configuration \nthat meets top-level, system requirements. In this sense, as Chap. 12 suggests, integra-\ntion and test is much the same as systems engineering. Testing includes all activities \nthat increase confidence in the system's performance. It ensures that we have met re-\nquirements and that anything happening beyond these requirements does no harm to \nthe system, while preserving specified functions. Testing for these \"extras\" is the most \ndifficult because we do not always know what we are looking for. Testing, especially \nfor the software-intensive computer resources associated with space systems, is a com-\nplex undertaking. It can consume up to half of the development cost and a significant \npercentage of support costs over the life-cycle. \n\n16.2.5 Life-Cycle Support \nMany issues associated with the development cycle affect conceptual design and \n\nlong-term life-cycle costs. For example, we select hardware and software design \nconcepts d~g requirements definition but we draw on implementation and develop-\nment eXperience to do so. Because we often have to cost activities for developing a \ncomputer system before a complete design is available, we must take into account the \nmany aspects of software and hardware development, testing, and integration. Soft-\nw~e-based tools and standards such as MIL-STD-498, IEEE and SAB Specification \nGwde. and ANSI standards help us structure our methods and give us more manage-\n\n16.2 Computer Resource Estimation \n\nSoftware Verification Hardware Verlllcallon \n\nI UnftTest I ICom~1 \n\" I ~ I IAcce,cnceI/ \n\n\" 1==&1 I~~nel / Test Test \n\" GrouJld.Based and / Space-Based \n\nSystems \n\nI~I \n+ \n\n671 \n\nRg. 16-8.

The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) has established \na rating system for the software development process. Companies can apply to SEI for \nincreasing levels of performance ratings [Humphrey, 1995}. Also, the International \nStandards Organization has established a process-based rating known as ISO 9000. \n\nIn addition to the development process, long-term issues such as life-cycle costs \nrequire attention during conceptual design. The complete life-cycle costs include \nconceptual design, detailed design, implementation, system integration. test, and \non orbit maintenance-plus the tools associated with each phase. There are many soft-\nware development life-cycle models which we can use. However, these continually \nevolve to reflect the current state of the software development environment Accord-\ning to Anderson and Dorfman [1991], \"As the software development process evolves, \nso will these models to reflect new types of applications, tools, and design paradigms.\" \nOur experience has been that development support software will require 8 to 10 times \nas many lines of code as the flight software. We can use this to estimate the cost of the \ndevelopment software as discussed in Sec. 20.3.2. The cost estimate we generate using \nthis method can be applied to either the development of support software or to procure \nCOTS tools as discussed below. Table 16-18 summarizes the various life-cycle issues \nwhich we must address during the early phases of program development \n\nBuilding an operational system depends on the development philosophy and \nenvironment we select Procuring commercial off-tke-shelf (COTS) hardware and \nsoftware is the easiest way we can build a capability. However, off-the-shelf items \noften don't meet our needs exactly. Thus, we must tailor the COTS products or adjust \nthe need to match what is available. The break-even point is different for each program \ndepending on the number and types of requirements, personal skills, our knowledge of \ntl1e product, and whether the COTS products are maintainable and of high quality. If \nwe opt for custom development, we must also consider the development and test tools \n\n\n\n672 Spacecraft Computer Systems 16.2 \n\nTABLE 16-18. Summary of L1fe-Cycle Cost Issues.

We may need special hardware, software, \nor integrated systems. For single-unit or unique systems, developing support tools can \ncost as much as developing the operational units. We must evaluate these support tools \nduring conceptual design, and include their cost in the overall development cost. As \nwith the cost of other developmental tools, we may be able to amortize these costs over \nmUltiple products or projects. \n\nWhen developing embedded flight software we must first determine if we want it \nin assembly language or a higher order language. If we have selected a higher order \nlanguage, we must decide which tools to use. Depending on the target processor ISA \nand the language selected, we must evaluate the availability and quality of cross-\ncompilers, linkers, assemblers, and the host processors on which they reside. A host \nmachine is the computer where the development activity is to take place. The target \nmachine is the embedded microprocessor or ground-based computer where the code \nwill perform throughout its lifetime. A cross-compiler executes on the host, compiling \nsoftware for the target processor. For both assembly language and higher order \nlanguages, the loaders and debuggers allow us to store software in the target processor \nand evaluate its performance based on either symbolic or physical information. \nSometimes the host computer and the target computer have the same ISA. In this case \nthe compiler is not the issue but library and other functions' availability on the target \nshould be explored. \n\n16.3 FireSat Example \n673 \n\n16.3 FireSat Example \n\nThe FrreSat example can help us better understand the process of estimating \ncomputer resources. We show two examples of software estimation: one for the space-\ncraft attitude control capability, the other for payload control and data management. \n\n16.3.1 FireSat Attitude Control Processing \nTo begin the estimation process, we need a list of allocated computer system \n\ncapabilities. For this attitude control example, we assume that the spacecraft is a ~ \naxis-stabilized vehicle using an Earth sensor, a Sun sensor, and rate gyros for sensmg \nvehicle attitude and attitude rates. Reaction-control thrusters generate the control \ntorques. Further, we assume that the highest frequency the system performs any \nfunction is 4 Hz (every 025 sec). \n\nFrom this information we can decide what the system must do. For example, it must \nprocess data from the Earth ~nsors, Sun sensors, and ~te 8Yf?s: To ~ess the data \nand determine the current attitude, we need to perform kinematic mtegration, or some-\nthing equally complex. To maintain the desired attituru:' we n~ functions f~ \ndetermining attitude error and for thruster control. A function to estimate ephemens \nallows us to keep track of orbital position. If the ground station regularly updates the \nephemeris, we need only a si~ple funct;ion to propaga~e it. Remember t~ ide~tify all \nassumptions whenever you estimate; this last assumption allocates functionality to a \nsupporting ground station. .. . \n\nWe can now estimate the memory and throughput requrrements for the application \nfunctions. Assuming a 1750A-c1ass host processor, apply the information in \nTable 16-13 directly to estimate memory for code and data. When using ~ tabl~, if \nyour particular function is estimated to be much larger or smaller than what IS typical, \nadjust the numbers accordingly. Estimating throughput requires ~ore effort. To ~ \nthe throughput numbers in Table 16-13, we must first estabhsh the execution \nfrequency for the attitude control computations. Table 16-19 lists the ass~ed \nfrequency for each application function. We estimate the ~oughput for a ~cti~n \nexecuted at 4 Hz by using 4 HzJlO Hz = 40% of the values 1D Table 16-13, which IS \nbased on a 100Hz execution rate. Table 16-19 shows the estimated memory and \nthroughput requirements by function. \n\nWe need to consider an operating system to complete the estimate for all the \nsoftware in the attitude determination and control computer. We have assumed the \nsoftware is in Ada\u00b7 thus we will need a run-time kernel. A COTS Ada cross-compiIer \nmay include a k~el. We must also have a local executive to perform task scheduling \nand management. The number of scheduled tasks per second depends on the number \nof application functions and their execution rate. For this example, we estimate 80 \ntasks per second. Because of the four sensors being serviced and the connection with \nthe data bus, we will need frve data handlers. To estimate how much data the system \nmust handle, first determine how much the sensors produce and how often they \ntransmit. Then add external commanding and telemetry requests. For this example, the \nhandlers will control the flow of 800 data words per second. The last functions to \nestimate are the built-in test and associated diagnostics. We determine memory and \nthroughput for each operating-system function from Table 16-13, taking into account \nthe assumptions above. \n\nWe have estimated memory and throughput requirements for all functions that the \ncomputer must support for attitude determination and control. But because early \n\n\n\n674 Spacecraft Computer Systems 16.3 \n\nTABLE 16-19. Estimating Size and Throughput for F1reSat Attitude Control Software.

First list the \nanticipated appRcations functions. Using the mission requirements we can \nestablish a baseline frequency for the execution of each function. Th~n, based \non either the estimation by similarity or by bottoms\u00b7up estimation, we determine \nthe mamory requirements for each function. Finally, using the estimation process \nand the estimated frequency of execution, we can determine the required \nthroughput for each function.

The \ntarget computer in which this software resides must also have spare capacity to accom-\nmodate on-orbit growth in the software. Table 16-21 includes the margin we need. In \nthis example, the ACS computer's minimum size and throughput are 155 K words and \n356 KIPS. \n\nTo assess cost and develop a schedule, we need to estimate the number of source \nlines of code, or SLOC. This estimate should consider only the software that we must \ndevelop, so we exclude margins and off-tile-shelf software. (The margin added for \ngrowth between the System Requirements Review and deployment is to reduce risk in \ndetermining processor requirements. Although not included in the calculation of \nsomce lines of code, we should consider it when we examine potential cost and sched-\nule risk.) The amount of software to be developed is 23.8 K words of code and 8.5 K \nwords of data memory. For costing, we use a factor of 25% to convert data memory to \nequivalent code words. We have to do so because developing a data word takes about \none quarter of the effort for developing a word of executable code. Thus, for this \nattitude determination and control example, the total becomes 26.0 K words. Assum-\ning the development is in a higher-order language such as Ada (using 1 line of code \nper 5 words of memory from Table 16-14), this translates to 5,200 source lines of code \nfor the FtreSat attitude control software. \n\n16.3.2 FireSat Onboard Payload Processing \nAs part of defining the conceptual design for FireSat, we start with the assump-\n\ntions for payload control & data management given in Fig. 16-9, including fire detec-\ntion and reporting and fire parameter estimation. We show our orbit and sensor \ncharacteristic infonnation in Table 16-20. We assume all FireSat candidate sensors \noperate in the single scan mode. The primary sensor differences for this example are \nin the scan width and the data sample sizes which, as we will see, are key drivers in \nboth the system and the data flow architecture trades. The scan width options can \nimply different size satellite constellations to cover the same area per unit time, or \nimply multiple sensors per satellite, e.g., one satellite with a single A or B sensor can \ncover the same area as either one satellite with four C sensors, or four satellites with \na single C sensor \n\nIn this example, we will focus on processor throughput. We also assume we will \nuse a general purpose computer (identified as GP in Table 16-22) and that the best \ncomputer we can acquire has a throughput of 100 MIPS. (See Table 16-17 for a survey \nof currently available processors.)

Allocations to Onboard Computer System for FlreSat Payload Management \nCapability. This figure delineates the various functional components of the FireSat \npayload management on board capability. We can either host this software in a single \nonboard computer (OBC) or we can partition it between several OBCs. likewise we \nmight perform these functions using hardware if appropriate. How we partition the \nimplementation depends on the computer system design and overall mission require-\nments. \n\navailable throughput is only 50 MIPS. As stated in Sec. 16.2, onboard software size \nand throughput historically double from initial conceptual design to launch. To \naccount for this future growth, we set a maximum threshold of 25 MIPS per processor \nfor this conceptual design phase exercise. \n\nThe primary software estimation method we use is Bottom-up Estimation (Table \n16-16). We generate the needed software information from raw data and basic \nassumptions. Once we break the functions into manageable pieces, we expect to find \nelements that we understand and can estimate. Table 16-21 provides an example of the \nsoftware elements and their characteristics that may be generated through the bottom-\nup estimation process. This example is not intended to represent optimum payload \ncontrol and data management algorithms; it is presented as a set of sample algorithms \nthat mission processing engineers may consider. Multiple algorithm sets are often \nconsidered for complex onboard systems, although we evaluate only one set here. \n\nSeveral candidate architectures for this example are shown in Table 16-22. The first \nassumed architecture is a direct (point-to-point) connection between the 1R sensor and \nthe processing hardware in which the payload control & data management software \nwill reside. The fire detection algorithm must first separate observations into \"possible \nfires\" and \"noise\". For first order calculations, we assume a simple thresholding algo-\nrithm to eliminate the noise; throw out samples below an intensity threshold, and \nthrow out above-threshold samples for which there are no adjacent above-threshold \nsamples. The clusters of continuous sample data are referred to as \"events.\" Table \n16-23 identifies the processing assumptions for a general purpose processor. For all \n,three sensor candidates, the throughput calculations show a prohibitive situation. For \nsensor C with the narrow field of view, there appears to be some promise, but the \nthroughput requirement still exceeds our 25 MIPS maximum. Additionally, the infor-\nmation in Table 16-23 doesn't include other software that we know must operate (such \nas the executive task scheduler or data 110 manager). We now must consider alterna-\ntives to our first architecture. \n\n16.3 F\"JreSat Example 677 \n\nTABLE 16-20. Characteristics of Candidate FlreSat IR Sensors. Based on the mission \nrequirements, outlined in the top of this table, there is a variety of approaches to \nsolving the problem. We must rnap out each alternative with quantifiable \nelements so that we can compare them fairly. No one solution Is better than the \nnext. However, one may meet our mission goals, requirements, and constraints \nbetter than the others. \n\nOrbital Orbit altitude (h) 700 km (Defined in Sec. 7.4) \nand Mission Period(F? 98.8 min \nparameters Ground Track Velocity 6,762 mls (From Table 9-15, \n\n(Vg) p.287) \nMin.

Again, the high throughput estimates in Table \n16-23 indicate this is not a viable option, given the 25 MIPS throughput limit we have \nestablished. \n\nClearly now, we need to add a special-purpose sensor interface unit into the \narchitecture to hold the scan information, perform the noise filtering function, and \nprovide the events from each scan to the general purpose computer. Since a small \nchange in a few parameters can lead to substantially different throughput estimates, we \nshould perform additional analysis at this point to justify the need for this custom \nequipment For example: doubling the ground resolution requirement (from 30 m to \n60 m) will reduce the throughput estimate by a factor of four. \n\n\n\n678 Spacecraft Computer Systems 16.3 \n\nTABLE 16-21.

With the one-ta-many approach. \nwe assume that we can segment the fire detection and reporting capability using \nparallel processing. With a single-scan sensor, we can divide each scan into N contig-\nuous segments. Then each processor will perfonn its fire detection algorithm on a \nswath of ground territory representing liN the width of the sensor field of view. \nAlthough the software functions do not change based on effective swath width, the \nspecial processor data management function changes with N, and we should size it \naccordingly. Note that we assume we use the same basic software in all the processors. \n\nIn order to proceed with our software estimation example, we need to identify the \npeak data rates from the sensor interface unit to each processor. Table 16-24 identifies \nthe sensor interface unit assumptions. Using the throughput estimates of Table 16-21 \nand the event rate estimates in Table 16-24, we are now able to estimate overall \nthroughput requirements for the payload control and data management software across \nthe sensor type and number of processor combinations.

Throughput Curves for FlreSat Example. These curves fIIustrate how we can trade \nthe number of onboard processors against the throughput and quantity of each \nprocessor to meet our overall mission requirements. Depending on size, weight and \npower constraints, as weil as cost, we can determine which solution best meets our \nmission needS. \n\nbeen identified to be a driver, given the algorithm suite provided in this example. It \nappears that sensor C can perfonn the mission with a single processor; however, the \nlimited field of view of sensor C may imply the need for additional sensors per \nspacecraft. \n\nSince processors are not 100% reliable, we need to establish a redundancy strategy. \nThis strategy will involve the use- of distributed vs. federated architectures. For a \nfederated architecture, we will likely need 2-for-l redundancy for each processor. A \ndistributed architecture-if the sm can suPP,Ort it-may allow more cost-effective \ncollective redundancy such as 3-for-2. Given this, our preliminary conclusion is that \nsensor A in a distributed processing architecture will result in the fewest number of \nonboard processors for the complete FireSat system. Of course we recognize that this \nis sensitive to our assumptions and will continue to examine the trade space carefully. \n\n16.3.3 Spacecraft and Payload Processing Consolidation and Effort Estimation \nAlthough we have dealt only with selected elements of onboard processing for the \n\nFrreSat space vehicle, areas of commonality have already emerged. As shown in \nTables 16-19 and 16-21, both spacecraft and payload software requires mathematical \nlibrary functions and some type of operating system. Some, perhaps significant, cost \ncontainment can be achieved using common elements: processors, software lan-\nguages, utility libraries, and real-time operating systems. \n\nSince the attitude control throughput requirement is small compared to the payload \nsoftware, the spacecraft software may co-exist with the payload processing. Although \nmerging the two may reduce the overall number of processors, the system develop-\nment complexity may increase. Merging them induces tight coupling between the \nspacecraft and payload, and may increase system integration complexity. The hard-\n\n16.3 FireSat Example 683 \n\nreal-time deadlines associated with spacecraft and payload processing are unrelated, \nt they will have to be arbitrated. A detailed trade study is needed to address the life \n\n~;cle o~ t!te sy~tern, from conceptual design through development, integration, test, \nand orbIt insertion. \n\nFor software cost, the most useful indicator is the number of source lines of code, \nr SLOCs. Various methods exist for determining overall effort and development \n\n~uration from the total number of SLoes and softw~ .productivity rates (See T~ble \n20-10 in Sec. 20.3 or Boehm [1984). When determining the total SLoe, consuler \nonly the software that we must develop. In the payl?ad processing example, we c~\u00ad\ncentrated on the executable SLoe. For overall costing, we must remember to add m \nthe SLOCs for startup, system initiaIization, mode transition, f~ult ~nses, ~d \nother identified functions. In the attitude control example, our estimatiOn method did \nnot use SLOes. For estimates made by similarity, the SLoe counts should be \ndeveloped in the same manner as memory and throughput. If SLCX:: info~tion is ~t \navailable, then an order-of-magnitude estimate can ~ generated usmg the information \nin Table 16-10 to convert a memory estimate to eqwvalent SLOCS. \n\nReferences \n\nAnderson, Christine and Merlin Dorfman, eds. 1991.

They lift the launch \nvehicle and its payload from the launch pad and place the payload into low-Earth orbit. \nThey transfer payloads from low-Earth orbits into higher orbits for mission operations \nor into trajectories for planetary encounters. Finally, they provide thrust for attitude \ncontrol and orbit corrections. Table 17-1 lists the specific functions these systems \nperfonn during various mission phases and some typical perfonnance requirements. \n\nPerfonnance requirements for propulsion systems include thrust, total impulse, and \nduty cycle specifications derived from mission profiles. Individual designs must meet \nother performance requirements, such as operating pressure, and internal and external \nleakage. Other specifications include physical characteristics, propellant, and mass \nproperties. Configuration requirements include envelope dimensions, thruster loca-\ntions, and alignment. In addition, plume efflux is frequently a design driver for \npayloads sensitive to contamination. \n\nOnce a payload is placed in low-Earth orbit by the launcher, an upper stage or \nonboard spacecraft integral propulsion system (see Table 17-2) is frequently used to \ntransfer the payload to its operational orbit. These in-space propulsion system designs, \nespecially their weight, size, and volume, are strongly driven by the performance and \nweight efficiency of the primary propulsion system. The specific impulse, propellant \ndensity, and overall stage mass fraction of the primary propulsion system are key \nparameters. Table 18-5 in Sec. 182 summarizes key features and performance charac-\nteristics of existing and planned upper stages for use with various launch vehicles. \n\nWith the heavy emphasis on driving down the cost of access to space, while still \nstaying within the capabilities of the current fleet of launch vehicles, many space \nsystems' prime contractors are designing and emphasizing higher efficiency and \n\n685 \n\n\n\nr \nI \n/1 \n\n686 Space Propulsion Systems \n\nTABLE 17-1.

The functions of the \nonboard IPS are to provide much of the propulsion energy for ascent from low-Earth \norbit to higher operational orbits and for controlled de-orbitlreentry at the end of \nmission life, in addition to the normal on-orbitattitude and velocity control propulsion \nfunctions. Spacecraft IPS have become almost routine for most designs. More than \n85% of all spacecraft launched have operational orbits of greater than 500 km. In \naddition, new international regulations make controlled de-orbit a mandatory require-\nment which increases the onboard IPS energy requirements. \n\nWith this need for higher onboard IPS propulsion energy almost all spacecraft \ntoday employ one of three IPS designs or some combmation: (1) storable bipropellant \n(i.e., employing N20 4 and monomethylhydrazine, or MMH, as the propellants); \n(2) Dual mode propulsion (employing N20 4 and hydrazine as high performance \n\n17.1 Propulsion Subsystem SelectiQn and Sizing \n\nbipropellants for A V and monopropellant attitude control); (3) one of several different \nelectric propulsion options, depending upon power available, bum time vs. weight \nrequirements and considerations such as propellant commonality, volume limitations \nand electromagnetic issues. Typical spacecraft electric propulsion options are tesisto-\njets (delivering -300 sec Isp using decomposed hydrazine), arcjets (delivering \n-500-700 sec Igpo using decomposed hydrazine or ammonia), Hall effect thrusters \n(delivering -1,500-2,000 sec Isp using Xenon and derived from Russian technology \napplied to Russian satellites such as GALS and GONAS), and ion propulsion (delivers \n-2,000-3,000 sec Isp, also using Xenon). As more and more of the orbit raising \nimpulse is incorporated on board the spacecraft instead of using a separate upper stage, \nmodem designs are typically using an optimized combination of chemical and electric \nor hybrid onboard propulsion. \n\n17.1 Propulsion Subsystem Selection and Sizing \n\nThe process for selecting and sizing the elements of the propulsion subsystem is \nshown in Table 17-2. We must carefully estimate the key performance requirements \nin steps 1 to 3 since they have the greatest impact on operation, weight. and cost. In \nstep 4 we identify as many reasonable options as possible, and pare the list down to a \nfew that have merit We then proceed to step 5 to develop sufficient detail to estimate \nthe performance, mass, and cost of each option. \n\nTABLE 17-2.

Solid \n\n\n\n688 Space Propulsion Systems 17.2 \n\npropellant-based systems have been used extensively for orbit insertion,but the space-\ncraft propulsion subsystem must be augmented with another technology to provide \norbit maintenance and attitude control. Liquid systems are divided into monopropel-\nlant and bipropellant systems with a third alternative, dual mode, that is a bipropellant \nderivative. Monopropellant systems have successfully provided orbit maintenance and \nattitude control functions, but lack the performance to provide high efficiency large t. V \nmaneuvers required for orbit insertion. Bipropellant systems are attractive because \nthey can provide all three functions with one higher performance system, but they are \nmore complex than the historic solid rocket and monopropellant combined systems. \n\nTABLE 17-3.

These systems are actually hybrid designs that use hydrazine (N2H4) both \nas a fuel for high performance bipropellant engines (i.e., N2041N2~) and as a mono-\npropellant with conventional low-thrust catalytic thrusters. The hydrazine is fed to \nboth the bipropellant engines and the monopropellant thrusters from the common fuel \ntank. In this manner, high specific impulse is provided for long t. V burns at high thrust \n(e.g., apogee circularization) and reliable, precise, minimum-impulse burns are pr0-\nvided by the monopropellant thrusters for attitude control. An additional capability to \nenhance dual-mode propulsion is the development of a bimodal thrust device which \ncan operate either as a simple catalytic monopropellant thruster or as a high per-\nformance bipropellant thruster known as the Secondary Combustion Augmented \nThruster or SCAT shown in Fig. 17~1. \n\nPractical considerations may restrict the propellant choices to those that are readily \navailable, storable, and easy to handle. Also, we must trade the lead time needed to \ndevelop new hardware against the combination of existing components or stages. \nFinally, limits on payload acceleration may dictate the maximum permissible thrust \nlevels. \n\n17.2 Basics of Rocket Propulsion \nTwo basic parameters of rocket engine design are thrust and specific impulse. \n\nThrust, F, is the amount of force applied to the rocket based on the expulsion of gases: \n\nF= mYe +AlPe -P\",,]=m'i (17-1) \n\n17.2 \n\nHydrazlne In\" \n\nBasics of Rocket Propulsion \n\nThermal SIandoIf/ \nBarriar1lJbe \n\n689 \n\nRg.17-1. Secondary Combustion Augmented Thruster (SCAT). Bimodal spacecraft attitude \nand velocity control RCS thruster. \n\nwhere Ae is nozzle exit area, Pe is the gas pressure at the nozzle exit, P\"\" is the ambient \npressure, Ve is propellant exhaust velocity, and m is propellant mass flow rate. We \nsimplify this expression by derming an effective exhaust velocity, C, as: \n\n(17-2) \n\nEquation (17-1) then reduces to: \n\nF=mC (17-3) \n\nAt very high altitudes and in space, P\"\" is essentially zero; at lower altitudes, a rocket \nengine's thrust increases with altitude until the vehicle leaves the atmosphere. \n\nSpecific impulse, [sp' is the ratio of the thrust, F, to the weight flow rate, mg, of \npropellant \n\n[sp aF/mg (17-4) \n\nlsp is a measure of the energy content of the propellants, and how efficiently it is \nconverted into thrust For a chemical rocket, [sp is directly proportional to the square \nroot of the ratio of the chamber temperature, T co to the average molecular weight of the \nexhaust gases, M, as follows: \n\n(17-5) \n\nwhere K is a proportionality constant depending on the ratio of specific heats of the \nexhaust. gas and the engine pressure ratio. This important relationship shows that we \ncan maximize specific impulse by matching the highest possible total temperature \nwith the lowest average molecular weight of the combustion products. \n\n\n\n690 Space Propulsion Systems 17.2 \n\nThe primary ~ure of propulsion system performance capability is the velocity \nchange, Il. V, that It can produce. We quantify this relationship by the rocket equation:\u00b7 \n\nIl.V= gIspln( mo )==glspln(mo)==gIspln(R) \nmo -11lp mf \n\n(17-6) \n\nwhere \"!! == mo - '!!P is the final vehicle mass, mo is the initial vehicle mass, 11lp is the \nmass of the propellant consumed, and R == mo / 1nJ is the mass ratio. This equation \n~umes zero l~ses due to drag and gravity, and is thus a limiting ideal case. In prac-\ntice, the ..1 V achieved will be somewhat smaller. Gravity and drag losses for launch \nvehicles are typically 1,500-2,000 mls. \n. Another form o~ Eq. (17-6) provides the mass of propellant required for a given \nmcrement of velOCIty, Il. V: \n\n(17-7) \n\nThis equation allows us to calculate the mass of propellant required based on either the \ninitial or final mass of the rocket. \n\nWe obtain the highest thrust when exit pressure equals ambient pressure. Although \nEq. (17-1) s~ggests that greater thrust can be obtained with an exit pressure greater \nthan the ambIent pressure, the exhaust velocity is reduced, resulting in a loss of thrust. \nAs a result, we design rocket exhaust nozzles with an exit pressure equal to the ambi-\nent ~ure ~enever possible. The exit pressure is governed by the nozzle-area \nexpanswn ratto: \n\n(17-8) \n\nwhere Ae is the nozzle exit area and At is the area of the throat of the nozzle. Note that \nas the expansion ratio increases, the nozzle exit pressure decreases. \n\n~or launch vehicles (particularly first stages) where the ambient pressure varies \ndurmg ~e bum period, trajectory computations are performed to determine the opti-\nmum eXIt pressure. However, an additional constraint is the maximum allowable \n~iamet~ for the nozzle exit cone, which in some cases is the limiting constraint. This \nIS especIally true on stages other than the first, where the nozzle diameter may not be \nlarger than the outer diameter of the stage below. \n\nFor space engines, where the ambient pressure is zero, thrust is always higher with \nl~er n~zzle exp~on m~os. On these engines, we increase the nozzle expansion \nmtio until the additional weIght of the longer nozzle (and increase in real nozzle inter-\nnal boundary layer or drag losses) costs more performance than the extra thrust it \ngenemtes. \n\n. Another im~t relations~.for eval~ting rocket performance involves two key \nFI~ of Ment, the chamcteristic velOCIty of the combustion gases and the thrust \ncoeffiCIent. The characteristic velocity, C*, is a measure of the energy available from \nthe combustion process and is given by: \n\n\u2022 The rocket equation was developed in the late nineteenth centmy and first published by Kon-\nstantin Tsiolkov,:;ky [1903], a deaf Russian schoolteacher who was the first to develop much \nof the mathematical theory of modern rocketry.

The differential between pressure Inside the cham-\nber (Pc) and at the nozzle exit (Pe) produces a reaction that propels the chamber and \nthe vehicle in a direction opposite to that of the exhaust gases. AtmospheriC pressure \n(P_) reduces the effective thrust (F), so that a rocket engine actuaDy works more effi-\nciently In outer space than In the Earth's atmosphere.

Together, they ensure 200 psia feed pressure to the propellant tanks, even after \nany single regulator failure. Both the fuel and oxidizer tanks can use propellant \nmanagement devices to feed propellants to the 100 lhrengine on demand. Burst discs \nand pyrotechnically actuated squib valves isolate propellants from the engine (and \nhigh-pressure gas from the propellant tanks) until the system is ready for ope11llion. \nIsolating the fluid enhances overall system reliability. This system also has manual fill \nand drain valves to load propellant and pressurant gas into the system, as well as \nadditional manual valves for system leak checking on both sides of the pyro-isolation \nvalves and regulators. Check valves ensure that fluid flow is only in the correct \n\n\n\n696 Space Propulsion Systems 17.3 \n\n~tion ~d that the fuel and oxidizer can never mix anywhere in the system. except \nm the engme. Fmally, pressure transducers, filters, temperature sensors, and line and \ncomponent heaters are provided to ensure proper subsystem operation. \n\nAnother type of system uses a cryogenic topping cycle engine. The fuel first travels \nthrough the thrust chamber's cooling jacket in a technique known as regenerative \ncooling. All ~f the fuel burns with part of the oxidizer in a high-pressure precombustor. \nThe combustion products provide high-energy gas to drive the engine pump turbines. \nThe total exhaust flow from the turbine is then injected into the main combustion \nchamber, where it burns with the remaining oxidizer. Because of the precombustor, the \ncycle lends itself to high-pressure operation, which results in a smaller thrust chamber. \nThe extra pressure drop in the precombustQr and turbines requires the pump-discharge \npressure of both the fuel and the oxidizer to be much higher than with open-cycle \ne~gines. Th~ f:'>pping cycle therefore needs heavier and more complex pumps, tur-\nbmes, and plpmg. It can, however, provide the highest specific impulse for a given \npropellant combination. \n\nThe Space Shuttle's main engine uses a variation of the topping cycle by employing \ntwo separate precombustion chambers, each mounted directly on a separate main \nturbopump. The oxygen precombustor and turbopump burn an oxygen-rich mixture \nthat expands through the oxidizer turbine to drive the pump. Then the mixture enters \nthe main combustion chamber, where it burns with the fuel-rich mixture from the fuel-\np~ombust~ ~d turbine assembly. The Space Shuttle's main engine develops the \nhighest specific Impulse (455 sec at vacuum) of any flight-proven rocket engine using \nchemical propulsion. \n\n. The expander cycle is somewhat different, in that the engine pump turbines are \ndriven by gaseous fuel which vaporizes in the thrust chamber cooling jacket The \nexpander cycle requires no precombustor. An expander cycle engine is shown in \nFig. 17-4. \n\nUquid Oxygen .. \n\nLiqu!d Hydrogen\" \n\nFuel Coolant \nPassage \n\nFig. 17-4.

By fa.: the most widely used ~ of propulsion \nfor spacecraft attitude and velocity control IS monopropellant hydrazine (N2~?' Its \nxcellent handling characteristics, relative stability under normal storage conditions, \n\ne d clean decomposition products have made it the standard. The general sequence of \n~perations in a hydrazine thruster (Fig. 17-5) is: \n\n\u2022 When the attitude-control system signals for thruster operation, an electric-\nsolenoid valve opens, allowing hydrazine to flow. This action may be pulsed \n(as short as 5 ms) or long duration (steady state). \n\n\u2022 The pressure in the propellant tank forces liquid hydrazine into the injector. It \nenters as a spray into the thrust chamber and contacts the catalyst beds. \n\n\u2022 The catalyst bed consists of alumina pellets impregnated with iridium. The \nmost widely uSed catalyst, manufactured by Shell Oil Company, is called S~ll \n405. Incoming liquid hydrazine heats to its vaporizing point by contact With \nthe catalyst bed and with the hot gases leaving the catalyst p.articles. The !e.m-\nperature of the hydrazine rises .to a poi~t where the rate o.f ~ts decompoSition \nbecomes so high that the chemIcal reactions are self-sustaimng. \n\n\u2022 By controlling the flow variables and the geometry of the catalyst chamber, a \ndesigner can tailor the proportion of chemical products, the ~xhaust ter.n~\u00ad\nture, the molecular weight, and thus the enthalpy for a ~ven application \n(Fig. 17-5). For a thruster application where s~cifi~ im~ul~e IS par:un~unt, the \ndesigner attempts to provide 3(}-4()% ammoma diSSOCiation, which IS about \nthe lowest percentage that can be maintained reliably. Fo~ a gas-gene.rator \napplication, where lower temperature gases are usually deSired, the designer \nprovides for higher levels of ammonia dissociation. \n\n\u2022 Finally, in the space thruster, the hydrazine decomposition p~oduc~ leave the \ncatalyst bed and exit from the chamber through a high expansIOn ratio exhaust \nnozzle to produce thrust. \n\nInjector \nDlstribuIIon Upper \nElement catalyst \n\nSeal \n\nRg. 17-5.

They are called latching valves because they stay in whatever position they \nwere last commanded (that is, open or closed), therefore only requiring power for the \ncommand period of approximately 200 ms. The system also has eight manual fill-and-\ndrain valves. Each tank has one propellant and one gas valve to load the hydrazine and \nON2 pressurizing gas on their respective sides of the positive-expulsion tank. The \nORO propulsion system also has miscellaneous components such as filters (to keep \nfrom c?ntaminating the system), pressure transducers, temperature sensors, and ther-\nmostatically controlled catalyst bed and line heaters. These heaters increase thruster \nlifetime and prevent the propellant from freezing. \n\n17.3 Types of Rockets \n699 \n\n17.3.2 Solid Rockets \nSolid rockets store propellants in solid form.

Schematic DraWing of a Hybrid Rocket. \n\nAD Drain \nNozzle \n\nThe California Rocket Society built hybrid rockets in the 1930s. The California-\nbased Pacific Rocket Society also conducted research in the mid-1940s, using liquid \noxygen with various fuels including wood, wax loaded with carbon black, and rubber. \nThe LOX-rubber combination was the most successful, and was test-flown to an \naltitude of9 km in June, 1951 [Altman, 1981]. \" \n\n17.3 Types of Rockets 701 \n\noNERA in France developed a hybrid sounding rocket using amine fuel and nitric \nacid oxidizer. The 3.3-m long, 75-kg rocket first flew in 1964. These flights continued \nfor three years, ultimately reachin~ altitudes in ex~ of 100 km [Salmo~ 1968.1. At \nthe same time, United Technologtes and Beach Aircraft developed a high~altitude \nsupersonic target drone using HTPB (hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene) fuel ~d \nIRFNA (inhibited red fuming nitric acid) oxidizer. This air-launched Sandpiper JDlS-\nsUe (later renamed HAST) first flew in 1968 and had a range in excess of 150 km \n[Altman, 1981]. \n\nHybrid rocket technology has progressed slowly since the 1960s. As of 1990, \nengines With thrust levels of75,000 lbf have been demonstrated in ground tests [Gu~\u00ad\nrie and Wolf, 1990]. Engines with thrust of 3,000,000 lbr have been proposed, but SIg-\nnificant technical hurdles remain before such large hybrids will be feasible [Jensen, \n1990].

For example, in an ion engine, an electric field accelerates \ncharged'particles which exit at high velocity. Alternatively, in a magnetoplasmady-\nnamic, or MPD thruster, a current-carrying plasma intemcts with a magnetic field \nresulting in a Lorentz acceleration to expel the plasma. \n\n\n\ni 1 \nI \n\n702 Space Propulsion Systems \n17.3 \n\nThere is no fundamental limit (other than the speed of light) to the exhaust velocity \nthat we can obtain with an ~lectric rocket However, the power required may grow to \nthe point where further acceleration is pointless. There is therefore an optimum \nexhaust velocity, and hence an optimum specific impulse, which depends largely on \nthe electric power sl,lbsystem [Stuhlinger, 1964]. \n\nThe propulsion system weight varies with the Specific impulse (exhaust velocity), \nthrust level, and total impulse. Propellant weight clearly drops off as specific impulse \nincreases. The power source requirements, however, are proportional to Isp. Thus, the \nweight of the power source increases with specific impulse, leading to a minimuni \nweight of the combined system (fuel and power source) at a particular value of Isp- We \nmay usually obtain cost savings by operating slightly below the optimum specific \nimpulse, since propellant is usually cheaper than more power supply. \n\nFor an electric propulsion device, efficiency is defined as the ratio ofldnetic energy \nexpelled to the input energy. For small time intervals, where mass flow is constant, we \nexpress efficiency, TJ, as a power ratio: -\n\nmv2 \nTJ= 2P (17-12) \n\nwhere TJ is the overall efficiency, m is mass flow rate, v is exhaust velocity, and P is \nthe input power. Recognizing that thrust F = mv, and that specific impulse Isp = \nF/mg, where g is the gravitational constant, we rearrange Eq. (17-12) to get power \nrequired: \n\nP= ~ = FIspg \n2mTJ 2TJ \n\n(17-13) \n\nFor a given IS]). and thrust, we use Eq. (17-13) to estimate power and mass flow rate \nof the working fluid. Typical values of TJ are included in Table 17-4, which also \nincludes useful information on selected propellants and energy sources. See Sec. 11.4 \nfor more on the power subsystem, or Clark [1975]. \n\nElectric Propu1sion Systems Design Concepts \n\nThe five electric propulsion (EP) concepts shown on Tables 17-9 and 17-10 have \nachieved operational status and many programs are underway to increase the number \nand types of missions served by EP. The following will briefly highlight the char-\nacteristics of mature EP systems that have become operational, or for which near-\nterm flight programs are firmly planned, and comment on the potentials of various \nclasses of EP systems. Table 17-9 illustrates the three basic types of electrical energy \nthrusters. Table 17-10 and Fig. 17-9 show key characteristiCs of selected, mature EP \nsystems. Figure 17-10 illustrates the fundamental concepts that enable operations for \n\n. alI electric propulsion systems. To mitigate the effects of mission specifics, the system \nspecific mass (in kglkW) only includes the mass of the thruster and power processor. \n(The masses of the propellant subsystem, gimbals, and other mission specifics are not \nincluded.) \n\nResistojets have been used for North-South sta~onkeeping and orbit insertion of, \nrespectively, communications satellites in the United States and for orbit control and \nACS functions on Russian spacecraft. Propellant temperatures are fundamentalIy \ndetermined by material limits in resistojets which implies modest (propellant specific) \nmaxima for specific impulses of about 300 sec for the 0.5-1 kW-class resistojets \n\n17.3 Types of Rockets 703 \n\nTABLE 17-9.

Arcjets have about twice the \nspectfic lDlpulse of resistojets while maintaining some desirable features such as use \nof standard propellants and relatively low dry masses. The increased specific impulse, \" \ncoupled with relatively low efficiencies of about 0.3 to 0.4, lead to significant \ndecreases (> 6X) of thrustIpower relative to resistojets. In addition, as complex \nplas~~ phen~menamus~ be controlled, arcjets require relatively complex power \nconditiorung which results m dry masses about twice those of resistojet systems. \n\n17.3 Types of Rockets \n\n\u2022 Electric Propulsion Converts Power and Propellant to Thrust \nSystem Conveniently Divided Into Three Subsystems \n\n- Power \n- Thrust \n- Propellant \n\nRg.17-10.

Arcjets do provide major mass benefits for many space-\ncraft, are relatively simple to integrate, and are the least complex and costly of any \nplasma propulsion device. For those reasons, low-power arcjets can be eXPa:ted to \nundergo evolutionary improvements and be used well into the future for a vanety of \nmedium-ta-high energy propulsion functions. Figure 17-11 also shows a 26 kW, \nammonia arcjet which operates at a specific impulse of 800 sec. The arcjet is part of a \nflight system called ESEX, built under a U.S. Air Force program by a TRW, ~x, \nand cr A Systems team, which includes the arcjet, supporting subsystems, and a diag-\nnostic suite to evaluate plume and EMI effects. The increased specific impulse relative \nto low-power arcjets is largely due to reduction of losses associated with low Reynolds \nnumber flows that are fundamental penalties for low-power arcjets. The space test will \nrepresent a greater than tenfold increase in power level of flight-demonstrated EP \ndevices and will address integration and mission issues critical to potential users of \nbigh-power (orbit-transfer-class) electric propulsion. \n\nPulsed plasma thrusters (PPfs) are inherently pulsed devices and versions w~ch \noperate at about 847 sec specific impulse and were built by the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) have successfully maintained \nprecision control of three NOVA spacecraft for many years.

The characteristics of PPrs \nwill likely limit their power operating range to under a few hundred watts and, as sug-\ngested by Table 17-10, they have large dry masses. Within their operating capability, \nhowever, PPrs promise a combination of low-power, high specific impulse, and \nsmall-impulse bit that is unique.

Flight-type HErs have been produced by Fakel Enterprise (Fakel), Kel-\ndysh Research Center (KeRC), and TSNIIMASH, all of Russia. and quite aggressive \nHEr R&D programs are in place in Europe, Japan, and the U.S. Table 17-10 lists three \nHEr concepts to ill~trate the state-of-the-art. The 1,600 sec specific impulse concept \nwas developed to flight ready status by a team including International Space Technol-\nogy, ~c., Loral, and Fakel; the 1,638 sec Isp device was built. qualified, and delivered \nfor flight test (at reduced levels of power and specific impulse) by a NASA, Primex, \nTSNlIMASH team; and the high power HEr is being built by Space Power Inc. and \nKeRC for a 1999 flight test on a Russian GEOSAT.

The 2,585 sec Isp system \nwas built by the Hughes Aircraft Company and is operational on a commercial \nCOMSAT launched in 1997. The 2,906 sec Isp concept was built by a team of Mitsu-\nbishi Electric Corporation and Toshiba Corporation of Japan and was flown on the \nETS-VJ spacecraft in 1994. An orbit insertion issue prevented the system from \nperforming its planned stationkeeping function but in-space characterizations were \nperformed in 1995 and an identical system will soon be flown on the Japanese \nCOMETS spacecraft. The 3,250 and 3,400 sec Isp systems were bUilt in Europe by \nteams headed by, respectively, Matra Marconi Space (MMS) and DASA. These de-\nvices have been baselined for stationkeeping on the European Space Agency's \nArtemis spacecraft to be launched in 2000. The 3,280 sec, 2.5 kW device is the highest \npower, mature ion thruster for which data is available and is used on NASA's New \nMillennium DS-l mission. \n\nHETs and ITs are the highest specific impulse options available for mission \npllQlIlers, and many analyses have been conducted to evaluate their use for high energy \nmissions. Comparisons of the two devices are difficult due to the relative lack of \nmaturity of devices built to comparable powers and standards. ITs operate reliably at \nhigher specific impulses than HETs and their performance and specific mass are \ndeeply penalized by operation at specific impulses less than about 2,500 sec, due to \nthe constraints imposed by the ion optics systems. On the other hand, HET systems \nperform at values of thrust/power 30% or more larger than those of ITs and are con-\nsiderably lighter but HET operations above about 2,500 sec will pose major lifetime. \nor redesign challenges.

In general, however, ITs become increasingly \nbeneficial as mission energies increase and HETs appear optimum for many time-\nconstrained situations, typical of Earth-space missions. \n\n17.4 Component Selection and Sizing \n\nThe simplest way to feed the propellant (or working fluid) to the thrust chamber on \ndemand is to displace it from its storage vessels with a high-pressure gas. Alternative \nsystems employ a pump, such as a piston or turboptimp, which can be driven by tur-\nbines, gas pressure intensifiers, or directly by electric motors. Turbine-driven pump \nassemblies may obtain drive power either from a hot-gas cycle (the most common \nmethod) or, in a few cases, from electromechanical actuators that in tum receive power \nfrom batteries or solar arrays. A feed system using intensified gas pressure may soon \nfind application in propulsion systems. \n\nWe typically use pressure-fed systems for rockets which deliver low to moderate \nlevels of thrust and total impulse (see Fig. 17-12). The simplified propellant feed \nsystem reduces the overall weight of the propulsion systems. This simplicity, often \nresulting in increased reliability, is particularly attractive for spacecraft applications. \nHowever, as total impulse and/or thrust requirements increase, the weight of the \npropellant tanks may become prohibitive. This is because the propellant tanks for a \npressure-fed system have to withstand a pressure somewhat higher than the engine \ncombustion pressure, thus they tend to be heavier than those for pump-fed systems. \nPump-fed systems are definitely lighter for applications using high thrust and longer \ntotal burn, such as for launch vehicles or large upper stages [Fritz and Sackheim, \n1982]. Because of these variables, we must conduct design studies and trade-offs to \nselect the best propellant feed approach. The next section includes schematic diagrams \nof typical liquid-propulsion systems using pressure or pump-fed systems.

To manage the liquid propellant, we may use artificial gravIty ~duced by ~ spm-\ning spacecraft or by a settling bum from another small rocke~ poSItive expulsion, or \n\n: surface-tension device.

In this manner the presswizing gas bubble is always main-\ntained in the center of the tank. All of these devices rely on surface tension forces to \nseparate liquids from gases [Martin, 1986]. \n\nDepending upon the specific mission requirements, a spacecraft can employ from \na few to as many as 30 thrust units. These thrusters may have to generate long, steady-\nstate burns for velocity control maneuvers to adjust or maintain the orbit. They may \nalso fire in short pulses of several milliseconds each to control attitude and manage \nmomentum; In some applications, an attitude-eontrol thruster may have to deliver in \nexcess of a million pulses over its lifetime. This wide range of operating conditions \nplaces great demands on propulsion systems that control the attitude and velocity of \nspacecraft. Thus, designers of these thrusters place at least as much emphasis on oper_ \nating life as on performance. In fact, in some cases absolute performance is secondary \nto requirements for extended lifetimes and reliability. Table 17-13 presents operating \nand performance specifications for typical flight-qualified attitude and velocity con-\ntrol thrusters. \n\nSome means of directing the thrust vector may be required to ensure that the thrust \nvector points through the spacecraft's center of mass. This system must account for \ncenter-of-mass shifts as propellant burns and allow for necessary manufacturing toler-\nances. If the disturbance torques resulting from a misaligned thrust vector are small, \nthe spacecraft's reaction-control system (that is, pulsing thrusters) can overcome them. \nIn other cases, the entire vehicle may be spun intentionally during firings of the main \nengine to cancel out any misalignment of rocket thrust. If not, we may gimbal the large \nrocket or only its nozzle. Alternatively, several rocket clusters may provide the main \nthrust, with opposing rockets turned Qff briefly to compensate for the disturbance \ntorques. Similarly, we can use a rocket engine's shallow-throttling ability to modulate \nits disturbances relative to any opposing rocket in the cluster. \n\nOther techniques for thrust-vector control, such as exhaust-jet deflectors (vanes or \ntabs), are not as common as the ones mentioned abov~ for exoatmospheric use. \nTable 17 -14 lists some representative values for the range of control authority that we \ncan achieve with various techniques for controlling the thrust vector. \n\nTo design a propulsion system, we must analyze requirements, trade off design \nfeatures, and size the system iteratively until we arrive at the best configuration for a \nparticular mission. Analyzing requirements includes performance, interfaces, and \nphysical characteristics. Design trades investigate different types of propulsion \nsystems, selection criteria, and design factors for the specific mission. Using sizing \ncalculations, interface considerations, and safety criteria, we determine the types and \nquantities of propellants and pressurants, as well as how to configure the tanks. com-\nponents. instrumentation. and power conditioning (if applicable). All choices must \nmeet design requirements within suitable margins. \n\nThe total impulse that the propulsion system must deliver derives from the velocity \nincrement (.\u00a3\\ V) it must impart to the spacecraft for maneuvers. the impulse required \nby the attitude-control system for limit cycling and managing momentum, and the \nspacecraft's weight. The allowable offset for center-of-mass affects the number and \nlocation of propellant tanks (or solid rockets), which usually occupy most of the pr0-\npulsion system's volume. The ranges for maximum acceleration establish criteria for \nthruster sizing. whereas duty cycling determines the type, response time. and operating \nthermal characteristics . of thrusters.

For example, the Inertial Upper Stage has a \nthree-SIgm~ geos~chronous poSItion error of 43 kID and a velocity error of 6 mls. \n.

Usmg the rocket equation presented in Sec. 17.2 (Eq. 17-6), we estimate the \npropellant load, 11Zp. from total impulse requirements: \n\nTT1p=ItlgIsp (17-14) \n\nwhere It is total\n2 \nimpul~, I sp is the specific impulse, and g is the universal gravity con-\n\nstant 32.~ 7. fils . KnoWIng the propellant mass, we can determine the propellant vol-\nume by diVIding by propellant density. For gaseous propellant, density should be at the \nstorag~ pressure and maximum anticipated tempereture. \nBesl~ expelled propellant mass, many other things contribute to the weight of \n\npr~pulsl?n syste~. Some examples are thrusters, tanks, fluid components, instrumen-\ntation, lines, fittings, power conditioning equipment, dedicated power equipment, \npressurant, ~d residual propellants (depending upon propulsion type). Initial sizing \nshould ~e tn!oacco~t knoWll hardware weights. Table 17-13 summarizes some rep-\nn:sentative! fllght-qualified, spacecraft thrusters. We should use similar data to select \nfllght-qual~ed, off-~e-shelfhardware that are close to meeting mission requirements. \nA sc~ematic or functional block diagmm (see Sec. 17.2) builds on the basic concept \nand SIze, as do the equipment list and weight summary. For a conceptual design, we \nmay use the methods outlined below. \n\nWe usually ~ize solid propellant systems so that each motor in the system provides \nthe total impulse for a single maneuver .. ~us, we need only know the mass fraction of \neach motor to calculate total system welgfit, because the weight of the other hardware \n-such as the safe-and-~ devi~e, explosive tmnsfer assembly, and initiators-is \nusually s~ b~ companson. SolId rocket motors are typically over 90% propellant \nby mass, mcluding case and nozzle assemblies. A value from 91-94% is reasonable \nfor present-day solid rocket motors with total impulse greater than 450,000 N\u00b7s. \n\n17.4 \nComponent Selection and Sizing 713 \n\nbnprovements in materials of construction should increase this value !<> more than \n95% by the mid-1990s. \n\nFor liquid propulsion systems, we size the tank after determining the propellant \nload beCause the tanks are the largest and heaviest components. For bipropellant sys-\ntems, we determine the oxidizer and fuel requirements from: \n\nOIF=mox!mtue1 (17-15) \n\nwhere OIF is the mixture ratio needed to deliver the required specific impulse, max is \nthe oxidizer mass, and '!'fu:e.l is the mass of the fuel. We calculate tank volumes from \npropellant volumes loaded into each tank, plus reasonable allowances for ullage (gas \nvolume in the propellant tank, approximately 5%), design margin, and propellant \nremaining in each tank because of tmpped liquids or uncertainties in loadin~ :md \nperformance. The ~~ retio is a ~tical ~ter in propulsion sy~ SlZlDg; \ntherefore, its selectIon IS the first step m determmmg the propellant quantities for a \ngiven set of propulsion-system requirements .(total i~pulse ). Very o~, we select the \nmixture retio for system benefits other than Just maxunum I sp- COnsIder the example \nof storable-bipropellant systems using N204/MMH for space systems. They almost \nalways use an OIF ratio of 1.64 because this value results in tanks of equal size. Eq~ \nsizing simplifies tank manufacturing, packaging of propulsion systems (configuration \nlayout), and integration. \n\nThe OIF retio at which the engine is opemting is defined as: \n\n(17-16) \n\nwhere Tit is the oxidizer mass flow rete, and Titfuel is the fuel flow rete. The \nmaximu;fueoretical value of the chamcteristic exhaust velocity, C\u00b7, is achieved at a \nspecific mixture ratio. This optimum OIF re~o depends on the. particular propellant \ncombination. Usually, we choose the OIF retio so that the reaction products have the \nmaximum achievable value of Tc 1M and thus the highest possible specific impulse \n[Gordon and McBride, 1976]. \n\nIn_some situations a different OIF retio results in a better overall system. For a \nvolume-constmined vehicle with a low density fuel such as liquid hydrogen. we can \nsignificantly reduce vehicle size by shifting to an oxidizer-rich OIF retio. In this case, \nthe losses in specific impulse are more than compensated for by the reduced fuel ~\u00ad\nage requirement, because combustion performance is not a particularly strong function \nof mixture retio. A large orbital transfer vehicle tmnsported to orbit by the Space Shut-\ntle would use this type of mixture retio, though there may be other situations as well. \n\nPressumnt gas requirements depend on the 'type of pressurization system \nemployed--regulated or blowdoWll (Fig.l7-12), or some combination of the two. \nAbout 5% to 10% ullage is provided in the propellant tanks for pump-fed or regulated \npressure systems.The total propellant tank volume for a blowdoWll system is the total . \nof the propellant volume, 'P, and initial gas volume, 'Vgi, in the tank. They relate \nthrough the blowdoWll ratio, R, as follows: \n\nR= VgflVgi \"\" [Vgi + Vp] I Vgi \n(17-17) \n\nwhere Vgf is the final gas volume, neglecting the propell~t vol~e re~ng at \nend-of-life as well as density changes with tempemture.

These systems most often \nappear in applications demanding low total impulse or extreme sensitivity to \ncontamination. In this case~ we can estimate tank weight with the aid ofEqs. (17-19) \nand (17-20). For example, the propulsion system which uses a nitrogen propellant for \nthe Orbital Maneuvering Unit has a TTUlSS fraction (ratio of propellant mass to propul-\nsion system mass) of 0.64. Thirty-five percent of its dry weight is in nitrogen gas \ntankage. \n\nThruster design requires specialized development to produce the best performance, \nlife, chamber pressure, and expansion ratio. Often, existing thrusters can provide a \nbasis for initial sizing. Sizes for fluid components (especially valves), as well as lines \nand fittings, develop from flow-rate requirements, which depend on the number of \nthrusters involved and the definition of specific impulse given in Sec. 17.2. Pressure \ndrops across fluid components also depend on flow rates. A pressure schedule starts \nwith requirements of the thruster's inlet pressure and works up through the pressure \ndrops in each sequential component to the propellant and pressmant tanks. \n\nTo design a propulsion system, we must consider some additional special topics: \ninteractions with the rocket exhaust plume, staging, maneuver accuracy, and thrust-\nvector control. Rocket exhaust plumes present three basic design issues. The first is \nplume heating of surfaces next to the rocket The second concenlS forces and moments \nthat the plume places on the spacecraft. For example, thrusters that control inclination \non geostationary satellites can lose about 10% of their delivered thrust because of \nplume drag on the solar arrays. To avoid this drag, we must mount the thrusters far \nfrom the solar array axis or cant them away from the arrays. The applied thnist vector \nis then degraded by the cosine of the thruster cant angle, because the applied thmst is \nno longer normal to the vehicle. A third issue concerns contamination by the plume. \nDepending on the propellants involved and the nature of their exhaust products, the \nplume may contaminate sensitive surfaces (such as optics or thermal control surfaces) \nof both the host and nearby spacecraft, such as the Space Shuttle or, eventually, the \nspace station. \n\nRocket-plume exhauSts divide into three regions: a continuous, forward-directed \ncore flow; a transition region; and a rarefied bacldlow regime. By carefully placing \nthrusters on the spacecraft, we can usually avoid the first two regions. Avoiding back-\nflow effects is difficult, but we can reduce them with large separation distances, plume \nshields, covers on sensitive surfaces, and operational constraints on thruster firings. \nDetermining plume effects in specific applications may require extensive analytical \nmodeling supported by selected test data [Furstenau, McCoy, and Mann, 1980]. \n\nOptimizing weight for a given space propulsion system depends upon its type and \nspecific operating parameters. Typically, for a system using a cold gas or pressure-fed \nliquid chemical, thrust-chamberpressure is the key to establishing its weight. Increas-\ning the chamber pressure in a system design and trade study produces several effects. \nThe engine will tend to be smaller and perform better because of increased area ratio \nand, to a much lesser extent, improved chemical kinetics (combustion efficiency). \nTherefore, the engine weight and propellant quantity will tend to decrease. Bllt the \npropellant tank, components, and plumbing weights will increase because of the \nhigher level of operating pressure required to force-feed propellants to the system, its \ncomponents, and into the thrust chamber. The thrust chamber operates at some nomi-\nnal pressure, which adds resistance by acting as a back pressure. Thus, for a given set \nof design and operating conditions, we can find an optimum design point for chamber \n\n\n\nj .... !:. E \n~ \n\nI ~ \nI ! \n.

(17-28) \n\nand the overall vehicle payload fraction by: \n\nA= (Aj)n (17-29) \n\nFor a multistage vehicle with dissimilar stages the overall vehicle payload fraction \ndepends on how we partition the Li V requirement among stages. We reduce payload \nfractions when we partition the AV suboptimally. Techniques have been developed \nwhich yield an analytical solution for the optimal A V distribution [Hill and Petersen, \n1970], or we may determine the optimal distribution by trial and error. In the latter \napproach, a AV distribution is postulated and the resulting payload fraction calculated \nas previously outlined. We have to vary the AV distribution until the payload fraction \nis maximized. Once we select the A V distribution, we size the vehicle by starting with \nthe uppermost or final stage (whose payload is the payload) and calculating the initial \nmass of this assembly. This assembly then forms the payload for the previous stage \nand the process repeats until all stages are sized. \n\nResults reveal that to maximize the payload fraction for a given AV requirement: \n\n1. Stages with higher lsp should be above stages with lower lsp. \n\n2. More AV should be provided by the stages with the higher Isp. \n3. Each succeeding stage should be smaller than its predecessor. \n\n4. Similar stages should provide the same A V. \n\nReferences \n\nAltman, D.E. 1981.

Primary restrictions \nare the launch vehicle's lift capability and the envirolllIWnt to which it subjects the \nsatellite during ascent A lalinch system consists of a basic launch vehicle incorporat-\ning one or more stages and an infrastructure for ground support It alters velocity to \nplace the spacecraft in orbit, creates a severe ascent environment, and protects the \nspacecraft from its surroundings. Ultimately, it places the payload into the desired \norbit with a functional spacecraft attitude. In this chapter the term payload includes all \nhardware above the launch-vehicle-to-spacecraft interface, excluding the payload's \nprotective fairing, Which is usually part of the launch system. Thus, the launch-velrlcle \npayload consists of the entire spacecraft above the booster adapter interface. For the \nShuttle, it is customary to speak of the payload as the spacecraft to be deployed Dr the \nsortie mission payload to be operated from the payload bay with the Shuttle providing \nall of the support functions. Shuttle missions normally accommodate both types of \npayloads on each flight. \n\nThe aerospace industry has typically managed launch vehicles in one organization \nand spacecraft in another, reinforcing a tendency to budget and manage at the inter-\nface. This approach has been, and in many cases will continue to be, successful. \nHowever, we must continue to ensure it leads to the most cost-effective technical and \nmanagement solutions. For example, traditional interfaces may not be appropriate as \nnew generations of maneuverable spacecraft with their own inertial references become \ncommon. These spacecraft-borne inertial platforms could be used to guide and \nnavigate launch systems, replacing similar systems in the launch vehicle. \n\nOver the last 30 years, launch vehicle performance has improved tenfold while \nreliability has slowly increased from 0.85 to roughly 0.95. Planners often do not \nappreciate that launch-system reliability and cost are keys to a successful mission. \nBecause the spacecraft usually costs more than the launch system, it can be very cost-\neffective to spend a bit more for a launch system with more reliability. \n\n119 \n\n\n\n721 \n720 Launch Systems 18.1 18.1 \n\nBasic Launch Vehicle Considerations \n\nIn this chapter we discuss some of the fundamental ph . cal . .

Note that the weight, W, of the vehicle acts at its center-of-gravity, cg, \nand the aerodynamic forces-lift, L, and drag, D, act at its center-of-pressure, cpo This \nconfiguration, with the center-of-gravity ahead of the center-of-pressure, is stable \nsince the lift and drag forces cause restoring torques about the vehicle's center-of-\ngravity. Ideally, thrust, T, acts through the centerline of the vehicle but we can develop \na control torque by gimbaIling the engine nozzle. We measure the vehicle's flight path \nangle, ,p, from the local horizon to its velocity vector and we measure its angle-of-\nattack, a, from its velocity vector to its centerline. \n\nv \n\ncg = center-of1lravlly \ncp = center-of\u00b7pressure \na= angle of attack \n\nFree-body DIagram \n\n~ = fUght path angle \n\nw w \n\nRg. 18-1. Forces Acting on a Launch Vehicle. By summing all the forces on a launch vehicle, \nwe can compute its acceleration and velocity, using Eqs. (18-1), (18-2), and an inte-\n\ngrating process. \n\nUsing the free-body diagram in Fig. 18-1, we can develop expressions for the \nacceleration along the axial, aX' and lateral, al.' body reference axes. \n\nax = g [TIW - sin(,p + a) - DIW cos(a) + LIW sine an \na\nz\n= g [-cos(,p+ a) + DlWsin(a) + LIW cos(a)} \n\n(18-1) \n\n(18-2) \n\nWe use Eqs. (18-1) and (18-2) to develop the vehicle's estimated acceleration shown \nin Table 18-8. We can calculate thrust and drag using Eqs. (17-1) and (6-21), respec-\ntively, and integrating Eqs. (18-1) and (18-2) in an inertial reference frame to yield the \n\nestimated velocity of the launch vehicle. \nWe can easily estimate the velocity that a launch vehicle should provide by \n\nAVdesign = AVbumout + AVgravity + AVdrag \n(18-3) \n\nwhere AV\nburnout \n\nis the velocity required for the desired orbiL We add the velocity \nlosses, AVgravity and AVdrag, to the burnout velocity to obtain the required design \nvelocity. We also have to account for velocity losses from thrust vector control for \ntrajectory shaping and other performance variables, such as solid rocket motor bulk \n\n\n\n! \nI \n\nJ \n\n722 Launch Systems \n18.1 \n\ntemperature, which causes thrust-level variations. Fig. 18-2 shows values for gravity \nand drag losses for a typical two-stage vehicle. Note that these losses are sensitive to \nthe initial tm:ust-to-weight ratio, T~. A low thrust-to-weight ratio causes gravity \nlos~ to be high because the vehicle spends more time in ascent, While high thrust-to-\nweIght causes drag losses to be high because of the higher velocities achieved in the \na~osphere. 'J!le ~t-to-we~ght ratio is a key launch vehicle parameter because it \ndictates the VIbration, acoUStic, and dynamic load environment for the spacecraft. \nThese environments are discussed in Sec. 18.3. \n\n1,000 \n\n~ \n~ \n\n250 ~ \n~ \n~ \n\n2 \n\nt---. \n\n3 \nTlWo \n\n4 \n\nAStwtIle \nA11Ian IV . \n\nDrag \n\nGravity \n\nFlg.18-2. Launch System Performance Losses. At the low end of TIVl{, gravity losses are \nhigher because the launch vehicle spends more time ascendlng: At the high end of \n\n. T/Vl{,. drag losses are higher because the launch vehicle reaches a higher velocity in \nthe atmosphere. \n\n.If there were no atm~he,re and no topqgraphica1 variations, an optimum launch \n~J~?IY would be ~ery similar to a Hohmann transfer and gravity losses would be \nminimized by thrusting normal to the radius vector. To accurately estimate gravity \nlosses we need to know a precise ascent profile and time of flight But for medium-to-\nlarge launch vehicles on nominal trajectories the velocity losses due to gravity fall \nbetween 750 and 1,500 mls. \n. Aerodyn~c drag forces acting on a launch vehicle are a function of the shape and \n\nSIZe of the vehicle, speed, and angle-of-attack, a. We can manipuiateEq. (6-21) to get \n\nDIW = Cd (AIW) q (18-4) \nwhe,re Cd is the dimensionless coefficient of drag (about 2.2), A is the vehicle's cross-\nsectional area perpendicular to its velocity vector, and the dynamic pressure, q, is \none-half the product of the atmospheric density (at the vehicle's clUTent altitude) and \nthe velocity squared. For the current inventory of large, expendable launch vehicles \nvelocity losses due to drag are less than 3% of the total change in velocity ~ \nabout 20 to 40 mls. The percentage decreases as the size of the vehicle decreases. \n\nOnce ,,:e know the required design velocity, .1Vdesign, from mission requirements, \nwe c~ estimate the mass of propellant required for the launch vehicle using Eq. (17-7) \nfor slDgie stage ~kets and Sec. 17.5 for launch systems with multiple stages. \n\nSeveral definitions are useful at this point The flight vehicle mass is the sum of the \npropellant mass, structure mass, including mass of the fairing, and the mass of every-\n\n18.2 Launch System Selection Process 723 \n\nthing above the launch vehicle interface, including mass of the spacecraft bus, \nyload. and any upper stages. We use mass fractions to describe the portion ~f ~e \n\nfught vehicle devoted to certain sections. For example, ~e propellant mass fractton IS \nthe mass of propellant divided by the total flight v~hicle .mass; the structure ~s \nfraction or deadweight fraction is the structural mass, lDcluding ~e!Dass of the famng, \ndivided by total flight vehicle mass; and the payload mass fractton IS the payload mass \ndivided by total flight vehicle mass. Typical values !or propellant, structure, and \npayload mass fractions are 0.85,0.14, and O.oI, respectively. \n\n18.2 Launch System Selection Process \nThe first step in the launch system selection process is. to establish the mi~ion \n\nneeds and objectives, since they dictate the perfonnance, trajectory, and the family?f \nvehicles which can operate from suitable sites. The ~on need should.be sta~ m \nterms of the specific return desired, e.g .. Earth observation data over ~fic ~ons \nof the Earth, weather information, ~. The missi~ ne:<l ~y tx: very specific as m the \ncase of a military objective, or as broad as a PresIdential Directive to land man on the \nMoon within a decade. A clear understanding of the real mission need is ex~ely \nimportant since it can dictate the launch strategy. For example, large conste~ati~ns of \nspacecraft may require periodic replenishment!aunches after the cons~ll~on IS full. \nAt the same time, a tactical satellite may reqUIre launch on demand WIthin weeks or \ndays. These drastically different requirements denJand different performance from the \nlaunch system and its supporting infrastructure. . \n\nAnother critical issue is whether the spacecraft will use a dedicated or shared \nlaunch system. The dedicated system may cost more, but it lessens the chances ~ a \nproblem with another spacecraft will adversely affect the launch. Payload secunty \nmay also demand a dedicated launch. On .~e other hand, shared launches are us~y \nless expensive per spacecraft. Before decIding on a shared launch, we must. consIder \nthe interaction between payloads in the shroud. If we mount them senally, for \nexample, we must analyze the probability that the upper payload will not deploy \nand thus interfere with the lower payload's deployment Examples o~ larger ve~cles \nthat can launch multiple payloads are the Space Shu~e, several Ari~e 4. vanB;Dts, . \nAriane 5 and Titan IV. We consider launching multiple spacecraft if their desired \norbital aititudes and inclinations are compatible. This works especially well for the \nSpace Shuttle, when primary mission payloads don't fill the paylo~ ~ay, ~r w~en the \nspacecraft are deployable and sortie operations has room. on the ~o~ ~elines: \n\nOnce we establish the mission need, then we determme specific mJSSlon reqwre-\nments. For low-Earth orbit missions, these usually consist of orbit altitude, inclination, \nand right ascension of the ascending node. In addition, estima~ payload weight. and \ndimensions become requirements to the launch system. The mJSSlon concept specifies \nsuch parameters as number of spacecraft, anticipated lifeti:t;ne and replacement strat-\negy, and method of data retrieval and management A required la~ch date also ~y \nbecome a selection parameter as it affects schedules, and the vehicle and launch SIte \navailabilities. \n\nWe allocate the mission requirements as functional requirements between the \nlaunch vehicle and payload. The basic question is, \"What specific ~ctions or opera-\ntions must the payload accomplish, and which must the launch vehicle perform?\" The \ntwo functions usually affected are propulsion, and guidance, navigation, and conb'ol. \nFor example, can the launch vehicle achie~e the fin~ orbit, ~ m~ the spacec:mft \nprovide orbital maneuvering capability to raise the orbIt to a higher altitude or change \n\n\n\nI I \nI'. :( \n\n724 Launch Systems 18,,2 \n\ninclination? The launch vehicle may require an upper stage to achieve the final orbit, \nadding to the launch cost. The alternative is to provide sufficient propulsive capability \non the spacecraft to perform the final propulsive maneuvers. We must carefully weigh \nthe impact to the spacecraft in additional propellant and tankage. in terms of cOst and \ncomplexity to the spacecraft design and trade against the potentially higher launch cost \nassociated with an upper stage. \n\nAsimiIar trade is made in navigation. guidance, and control (Chap. 11.7). Space-\ncraft computer capabilities have grown by orders of magnitude over the past twenty \nyears. Consequently, the spacecraft navigation. guidance and control subsystem can \ntechnically provide this function to the launch system during ascent. However, this \napproach results in a highly coupled payload and launch system which presents some \nnegative attributes, including a more complex integration of the two, and makes it \nmore difficult to manage at the spacecraft-to-Iaunch-vehicle interface. The current \ntrend is to separate the spacecraft and launch system functions at the interface, both \nfunctionally and physically, to minimize interface requirements and complexity. \n\nWe must assess each function required to achieve the mission objective through \nthis process. and allocate functions based on cost. reliability, and risk. This is a classic \nsystems engineering problem, which we must continuously evaluate as part of the \nvehicle selection process and as the spacecraft design matures. \n\nHaving established mission requirements, constraints, and the required information \nin Step 1 of Table 18-1. we must decide which launch-system configurations can \ndeliver the spacecraft to its mission orbit. The launch systems selected during concep-\ntual design should satisfy the mission's perfonnance requirements and minimize \nprogram risk. We want to choose the launch systems early, so contractors for the \nspacecraft and launch system can negotiate requirements early. as well. Doing so \ndecreases changes in design, cost, and schedule downstream. Recent experiences \nshow that we should design spacecraft to be compatible with several launch systems \nto enhance launch probability. as well as to provide some leverage in negotiating \nlaunch cost. FIxing problems that may cause launches to fail takes months or years. If \nwe change the launcher we may have to redesign the spacecraft and its interfaces with \nthe launch vehicle. A redesign costs a lot of time and money. To solve this problem. \nwe select an alternate launch vehicle, as a backup. early in the process, and design the \nspacecraft to be compatible with both. \n\nSelecting a launch system depends on at least these criteria: the launch vehicle's \nperformance capability to boost the necessary weight to the mission orbit, the \nrequired launch date versus vehicle availability, spacecraft-to-launch-vehicle com-\npatibility, and of course, cost of the launch service. The launch system's perfonnance \ncapability must include factors such as perfonnance margin, and a clear definition of \nweight and performance parameters as given in Table 18-2. Note that the payload \nperformance quoted by launch vehicle manufacturers must be greater than the pr0-\njected boosted weight. This difference (launch system perfonnance capability minus \nspacecraft boosted weight) is referred to as performance margin and is an important \nselection criterion. Note that the perfonnance margin is in addition to the allowances \nmade for spacecraft weight growth (see Table 10-9). \n\nPerfonnance margin is an important parameter throughout a program. but it is \nparticularly important early in a program. Ideally a spacecraft launches with a small \npositive performance margin, meaning that the spacecraft weighs (when it is com-\npleted and delivered) just what the launch system can place into orbit. For spacecraft \nwith propulsion systems, we use propellant loading to trim the fmal weight. \n\n18.2 \nLaunch System Selection Process 725 \n\nTA\nBLE 18-2. Weight Parameter DeflnlUons.

The fairings must be.physlcally larg: \nenough to house and protect the spacecraft during ascent. and the mterf~ to th \nspacecraft. both structural attachment and other services such as cooling (see \nSec. 18.3), must be acceptable to the spacecraft. \n\nWe must also consider the launch schedule and whether\u00b7 th~ preferred I~unch \nsystem will be available.

Fmally, if we intend to change the launch site, we DlUst \nconsider the effect on scheduling and cost \n\nLaunch aVailability brings other dimensions to launch-system selection. The avail-\nability of a launch system depends on its reliability, production capacity, the ability of \nthe launch operations system to support the desired launch rate, existing launch COID-\nmitments, and its demonstrated stind-down time following a failure. The relationship \n\nA = 1- [L(1 - R)1dI(1 -1/S)] (18-5) \nallows us to discuss this concept. Here the expected launch availability, A, measured \nin percent of the time the launch system is available, depends on the vehicle's reli-\nability, R. the nominal or planned launch rate, L, in units of flights per year, the \ndemonstrated (or estimated) stand-down time following a failure, T\n\nd\n, in units of years, \n\nand the 'surge-rate capacity, S, where S = 15 means the system can achieve a flight \nrate 50% higher than the planned rate L. Launch systems in the United States can \ntypically surge to between 1.15 and 1.5 times the nominal launch rate. Figure 18-3 \nillustrates results from Eq. (18-5). Negative results mean that the system probably \nwould not be available when needed. We must use Eq. (18-5) with caution since a \nsingularity occurs for surge values approaching one, i.e., the system has no surge \ncapacity. Commitment to two systems with poor availability means that some of the \nspacecraft so committed will not fly or may be delayed for several years. Table 18-3 \nprovides estimated reliability and stand-down times for typical launch systems. \n\n0.9 r-----r--~--~---r-_ __,;__-_,;_-_, \n0.8 \n\n0.7 t---+----+ __ -+--=..,=;......--I'\"---= ........ _-I \n\n0.985 0.97 0.975 0.98 0.985 \nVehicle ReIIabDJty 0.99 0.995 \n\nI \u2022 FIlght Ralh 4 X FIlght Rate = 8 \nRg.18-3.

For a high launch rate (8 per year), the same system may not be available \nwhen needed. \n\nUsing the above criteria, we can narrow the field of candidates to a few launch \nsystems by evaluating them consistently and systematically.

The 692? extended the earlier 3920's tanks to store more propellant and \nadded Thiokolsohd-rocket boosters for better performance. The 7925 uses an \nupgraded Rocketdyne RS-27 A main engine and Hercules GEM solid rocket boosters. \n~ 6920 and 7920 are two-stage versions of the 'three-stage 6925 and 7925 respec-\nti~ely. Both co~ vehicles use liquid oxygen and RP-l propellant in the first s~ge and \nru~gen tetrOXIde ~N204) and Aerozine 50 (A50) in the second stage. They use inertial \nguIdance and provIde control moments from gimballed engines. Of the nine boosters, \n\n18.2 Launch System Selection Process 731 \n\nsix ignite at lift-off and stage at 57 sec. The other three ignite at altitude during the first \nstage bum. The first and second stages are staged at 265 and 440 sec respectively. The \nthird stage uses a spin-stabilized Star 48 Brocket Iilotor in the PAM-D upper stage. \n\nAtlas/Centaur launch vehicles include the Atlas I, Atlas n, Atlas llA,and AtlaS \nnAS. The Atlas vehicle's core system uses liquid oxygen and hydrocarbons (RP-l) in \na stage-and-a-half form. with three engines ignited at lift-off. Two of these booster \nengines jettison at 172 sec. and the third sustainer engine bums for another 111 sec. \nThe Atlas is inertially guided and controlled in pitch and yaw by gimballed engines. \nVernier engines on Atlas I control roll in the first stage. For Atlas n. IIA. and HAS, a' \nhycIrazine roll control system attached to the interstage adapter controls the roll angle. \nThe Centaur uses liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen for propulsion. It has two \nRL-IOA engines, which can start several times and bum 400 to 600 sec. Gimballed \nengines control the Centaur during bum, and 12 reaction-control engines control it \nwhen it coasts. On the nAS version, four solid rocket motors improve the lifting \ncapacity. Two motors ignite with the three main engines for lift off. When the first two \nmotors bum out they drop off, then the other two bum until depleted and drop off. \n\nThe Titan II is a refurbished ballistic missile configured as a launch vehicle. It was \nessentially the core vehicle for the retired Titan III series .. For fuel, the Titan n uses \nstorable propellants: a nitrogen tetroxide oxidizer and Aerozine 50 (a 50150 mixture of \nhycIrazine and UDMH). Adding two solid rocket boosters and a third stage for the \nTitan m vehicle increased lift capability significantly. Fifty-five Titan n missiles were \navailable to modify, eleven of which completed modification and launched success-\nfully, as of late 1998. The Titan IV vehicle adds solid rockets to the Titan core vehicle. \nThe solid rockets are the \"zero\" stage ignited for lift-off, whereas the core vehicle's \nengines ignite when the solid.:rocket motor's thrust tails off before separating. The \nTitan N zero stage burns 138 sec, the first stage 164 sec, and the second stage 223 sec. \nA strap-down inertial system provides guidance using liquid injection (UDMH) to \ncontrol the thrust vector in the zero stage and gimballed engines for the first and sec-\nond stages. Titan N is compatible with two upperstages, IUS and Centaur. \n\nThe Space Shuttle delivers, services, and recovers payloads. The Shuttle uses two \nsolid-rocket boosters and three liquid-oxygen and liquid-hydrogen engines for propul-\nsion. The solid-rocket boosters bum out at approximately 123 sec. At first, the main \nengines bum in paraIlel with the solids, then continue to bum for 522 sec. For each \nflight. the Shuttle can carry up to three PAM-D payloads, one IUS, or one TOS. \n\nThe Pegasus air-launched booster and its -XL variant use wings to provide lift and \nthree stages powered by solid-rocket motors. A strapped-down inertial system guides \nthe booster. Aerodynamic fins control the fIrst stage, and vectorable nozzles control \nthe second and third stages. A cold-gas system for reaction control adjusts attitude \nwhile the spacecraft coasts and when the payload deploys and separates. Employing a \nLockheed L-I0ll as a launch platform reduces the propellant needed to achieve orbit \nand provides variable launch azimuths and locations for different orbital inclinations. \n\nSpace Data Corporation, a subsidiary of the Orbital Sciences Corporation, devel-\noped a standard, small launch vehicle called Taurus. The fIrst stage is essentially an \nMX missile first stage, and the upper stages are similar to those flown on Pegasus, \nwithout the atlached wing. Two successful launches in 1998 placed seven satellites \ninto low-Eartlforbit. . . \n\nLockheed-Khrunichev-Energia International offers Proton for commercial \nlauncheS. The original Russian D-le version has four stages and delivers payloads to \ngeostationary orbits. The fIrst three stages use stomble propellants (UDMH and N20 4), \n\n\n\n732 Launch Systems \n18.2 \n\nbut the upper stage bums liquid oxygen and kerosene and has a multiple start capabil-\nity. It has supported planetary and lunar launches and placed communication satellites \nin space. The 3-stage D-l launches the MIR and other large payloads into low-Earth \norbits. The new commercial K and M versions use the same first three stages, but add \nthe DM and Breeze M upperstages, respectively. \n\nChina's Great Wall Industries builds, offers commercially, and operates the Long \nMarch vehicles. The Long March CZ3 is a three-stage vehicle, using storable propel-\nlants in the first two stages and cryogenic liquid-oxygen and liquid-hydrogen in the \nthird stage. A new heavy-lift variant, the CZ3B, uses four liquid strap-ons and can \ncarry 13,600 kg into low-Earth orbit. \n\nThe current versions of the Ariane launch system are the Ariane 4 and 5 series. \nArianespace operates these vehicles commercially. Ariane 4 is a three-stage vehicle \ncapable of using from zero to four strap-on solid or liquid rocket boosters. The liquid \nstrap-ons and stages one and two use\u00b7storable nitrogen tetroxide and UH-25 (a mixture \nof 75% unsymmetrical dimethyIhydrazine and .25% hydrazine hydrate). The third \nstage burns liquid hydrogen and oxygen. Ariane 5 is a new, heavy-lift vehicle, \ndesigned for reliability and cost effectiveness. It has a core stage that uses liquid \nhydrogen and oxygen, an upper stage that burns nitrogen tetroxide and monomethyl \nhydrazine, and two solid-rocket-motor strap-ons that are recoverable. Eventually, \nArianespace will rate this vehicle for crewed launches. It has had \u00b7two successful \nlaunches after an initial launch failure. Ariane launch vehicles are efficient boosters \nfor low-inclination or geotransfer missions because of their Kourou launch site: just \n5 deg north latitude. As a result of the location and launch successes, they have \ncaptured more than half of the launch traffic for commercial communication satellites. \n\nJapan's space agencies operate two launch systems and are designing a third. The \nH-2 is a new heavy-lift vehicle that can place 10,500 kg into low-Earth orbit. This two-\nstage vehicle burns liquid hydrogen and oxygen in both stages and has two soIid-\nrocket-motor strap-ons. Launching from Tanegashima Space Center, it has six \nsuccesses in six attempts. The M-5 is a new three-stage vehicle, capable of launching \n1,800 kg into low-Earth orbit. All stages use solid rocket motors, burning hydroxy-ter-\nminated polybutadiene (lITPB). This vehicle operates from the Kagoshima Space \nCenter and has two successes in two attempts. A new design, 1-1, uses the H-2 solid \nrocket booster as stage one and the two upper stages from the M-3Sn as its uwer \nstages. Because of these common parts, its design went quickly. \n\nTable 18-6 lists the available launch sites for eac~ launch system. Once we have \nidentified the mission orbit and launch system, the appropriate launch site(s) become \napparent. The key U.S. launch sites are the Eastem Range at Cape Canaveral Air Force \nStation, Florida, which serves the Kennedy Space Center next to it, and the Western \nRange at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Ca1ifornia. The Wallops Island facility in \nVirginia can launch a number of smaller commercial launch vehicles and sounding \nrockets. \n\nFigure 18-6 shows the location of the world's launch sites, and Table 18-6 identifies \ntheir coordinates. We can get the best performance from a launch vehicle into a direct \norbit by locating the launch site a~ the equator to take advantage of the easterly velocity \nfrom Earth's rotation. Theoretically, we can attain any orbit inclination from the equa-\ntor, but we may select other sites for convenient access, security, or political reasons. \nLaunch sites at higher latitudes cannot directly access orbit inclinations much below \ntheir latitude, and trajectory profiles that go to higher inclinations sacrifice velocity \nand payload mass. An inclination change of one degree requires about 208 mls of \n\n18.2 Launch System Selection Process 733 \n\n. . low Earth orbit. As Eq.

The direction of launch, or \nlaunch azimuth, depends on range safety considerations that prohibit flying over \ncertain land and ocean areas. Figure 18-7 shows the launch azimuths and inclina-\ntions directly available from the U.S. Eastern and Western launch sites. The Japanese \nhave only two 45-day launch periods, one in the spring and one in the winter. At other \ntimes, the launch would threaten fishing fleets by dropping booster parts into the \nfishing area. \n\nVandenberg Air Force Base \n38 \n\n36 z \nI \n; \n\n32 \n\n~L-~~-L~ __ L-~~~ \n124 122 120 118 116 \n\nlongitude (deg W) \n\nKennedy Space Center \n\n82 80 78 \nlongitude (deg W) \n\n76 \n\nRg. 18-7. Orbit IncUnations and Launch AzImuths Available from the Eastern and Westem \nRanges. In general, low-Inclination orbits are possible from the East coast and high-\nIncDnation orbits are possible from the West Note that orbital Inclinations available \nfrom these launch sites depend on launch azimuth. \n\nGiven a choice of launch sites and launch dates, we must consider weather at the \nlaunch location. Bad weather can severely restrict chances to launch, thus costing time \nand money. The site's location and time of year determine surface weather and winds \naloft. For example, Florida and French Guiana have many thunderstorms and fre-\nquent lightning during the spring and summer. Because the highly ionized gas in the \nlauncher's exhaust plume can attract lightning, we must launch carefully in these sea-\nsons. During the winter, the winds aloft are severe because the jet stream moves to the \nsouth and often passes over both the Eastern and Western Ranges. As a result, we must \nstudy weather information for all possible sites. \n\nAlthough only a few launc~system vendors operate in the U.S., we can choose \nintelligently from many types of launch vehicles. Several government organizations \nmanage these systems. The Air Force Space Systems Division (AFSSD) developed the \nTitan, Atlas, and Delta launchers and matches launchers to users' requests. Air Force \nSpace Command manages launch operations at DoD launch sites. N~SA manages the \nSpace Transportation System through NASA Headquarters. Vendors of commercial \nlaunch vehicles contract services directly with users. Contractors obtain license \napprovals to launch through the Department of Transportation, Office of Commercial \nSpace Transportation. \n\n18.3 Determining the Spacecraft Design Envelope and Enviromnents \n\n18.3 Determining the Spacecraft Design \nEnvelope and Environments \n\n735 \n\nOnce we've identified several launch systems for our mission, we must determine \nth nfiguration of the interfaces between the launch system and payload and under-\ns:UC: the environments that the payload must withstand We c~ use the param~ters \nfor the launch system we select; however, a preferred approach IS to matc~ enVJrOn-\n\nts and m\u00b7 terfaces to the combined parameters of several launch vehicles.

In this \nsection, we will address the environment from the time we mstall the payl~ad \u00ab?D top \nf the launch vehicle until it's through the ascent. In many areas, the combinatio~ of. \n~gh accelerations and vibrations coupled with the ~~al environment and. rapIdly \nchanging local pressures result in environmental con~tions m~ se.v~re than It would \nex . ence on orbit Carefully considering these envrronments IS critical to spacecraft 00:;. Three areas require particular attention: usable payload volume ~ffered by the \navailable fairings, structural and electrical interfaces, and payload enVlfODDlents, as \nsummarized in Table 18-7. . \" \n\nFairings. Launch-vehicle vendors ort:er a ~ide ~g~ of pa~l?ad fainngs. They \ndefine the usable payload volumes and dimenSions Within the famngs for the ~pace\u00ad\ncraft. These values account for payload and fairing defl~tions due .to stati~ and \ndynamic loa~s encountered during ascent. Table 18:4 proVIdes aPF.>ximate dimen-\nsions for various systems, and Fig. 18-8 shows a typical payload famng. \n\nThe mission designer must ensure that the spacecraft will fit within the allowable \nenvelope. The fairing protects the payload from aerodynamic loads ~d. in general, \nprovides a benign enyirQnment, as discussed below, to lessen the unpact on ~e \npayload Generally the payload fairing is jettisoned late in ~e ascent when dynllllll:c \npressure and the heating rate are below acceptable levels specified by the launch vehi-\ncle vendor. Different times can be negotiated, if required. We do not need to analyze \npayload and upper-stage combinations which are similar ~ pre~o~l~ fl~wn payloads \nas extensively as new or unique payloads, because analysIs by similanty IS ~table. \nIf available fairings are unsuitable, launch vehicle vendors can develop famngs to \nmeet unique requirements.. . \n\nThe Space Shuttle's cargo bay IS so large that It usually accommoda~ several ~y\u00ad\nloads. To help planning. the bay is partitioned into four sectors, allocating a specified \namount of electrical power, cooling, telemetry, and so forth, to ew:h-comparable to \nthat available from a Delta or Atlas vehicle. Larger payloads combme resources from \nseveral sectors to meet their requirements.

We must identify interfaces between the \npayload and the launch system early in the design process. For example, a payload \nadapter attaches the payload to the launch vehicle, and we have to determine whether \nthe payload needs additional support. The adapters physically connect the payload and \nany required kick motors, spin tables, separation systems, or electrical interfaces. The \nlaunch-vehicle manufacturer usually provides them, if necessary, tailoring them to \nindividual requirements. Adapter mass reduces available payload mass, so it is some-\ntimes an important part of selecting the launch vehicle. Examples of booster-adapter \nmasses are the 51-kg single-launch Type 1666A adapter for the Ariane 4, and, for \ndual-launch systems, the 44O-kg Long SPELDA, also for Ariane. Section 11.6 \nprovides a method to estimate booster-adapter weight, but actual weights are in the \nlaunch vehicle users' guide. \n\nLaunch-vehicle manufacturers must provide physical, electrical. radio frequency, \nand optical access to the payload while the fairing encloses it Effective operations \ndemand the correct location of access doors and windows for radio frequencies and \noptics. In many cases, manufacturers must wire the launcher to command and safe the \nspacecraft. They also provide the mechanisms that separate the payload from the \nlaunch vehicle in orbit, typically by using redundant logic and circuitry to trigger \nredundant, ordnance-firing systems. High reliability in the payload separation mecha-\nnism is important. \n\nThe launch system and payload must match the desired communications architec-\nture for launch operations. Communications requirements depend on the combined \ndemands of the entire space mission: ground stations, payload, launch vehicle, range \nsafety, and the user. We can adjust launch trajectories somewhat to provide redundant \nground-station coverage during launch if needed. When we cannot get ground \ncoverage, aircraft can cover critical events. We must check the entire communications \n\n18.3 \nDetermining the Spacecraft Design Envelope. and Environments 737 \n\nAtmospheric \n\n,-- ..... , ... \n/ '\\ \n\nI \\ \nI \\ \n\nI \\ \nI \\ \nI Spacecraft \n\n\\ , \\ Air Conditioning \nLaunch Site I Should At I \nMechanical I Within the \\ \n\n- Cleanliness \n\nand , prescribed I - Temperature \nElectrIcal I Envelope I \nInterfaces , I \n\nI I \nI --.: Clearance I (Stay-out Zone) \nI I \n\n:.-- Usable----+: \nI Diameter I \n\nI I \n\nFaring ~ \nDiameter : \n\nI \n\nElectromagnetic I I Interference \nI I \nI \n\nAcoustic and \nI \n\nI I \nI Vibration I Interface \nI I Attachment \nI I - Mechanical Access I I - Electrical Panels I I \nI I \nI \n\nFI 18-8 Typical Launch-8ystem FaIring.

Table 18-7 hsts the \npayload environments that we should assess for pre-launch and launch. The ~upply of \nconditioned air to the payload fairing controls the pre-launch therJ?l~ envrr.onment. \nConditioned air typically moves through ducts into the top of the famng, w~e v~nts \nnear the fairing bottom maintain acceptable press~~ and temperatures.

Where necessary, we need to control the handling \nof particles and molecules from the launcher's out-gassing materials. To model how \ncontaminants move from source to removal, we analyze the thennal characteristics, \ncompartment airflow, outgassing properties of materials, qualities and location of \nmaterials. and spacecraft components. We have to consider these analyses from \nground processing through ascent. \n\nElectrical signals must be compatible among the spacecraft bus, the payload. the \nlaunch vehicle, and the launch site. ElectriCal signals of different frequencies and \npowers can corilbine to form spurious radio transmissions and electric fields that spoof \nsystems or fire ordnance devices. Shielding and design of ordnance circuits must \nconform to safety regulations at the launch site. For after lift-off, the launch-vehicle \noperator defines, documents, and integrates the flight electrical environment. The \npayload developer's analysis ensures that the spacecraft is compatible with these \nascent conditions. \n\nThe following analyses of ascent environments concentrate on discrete events \nwhere flight experience shows the environment may drive the design. These design \npoints include ignition and shutdown events, and periods of maximum dynamic pres-\nsure, maximum acceleration, peak heating rates, and heat loading. \n\nSeveral analyses help us define and control the thermal environment for payloads \nduring ascent. For expendable launch vehicles, we assess the thennal effects due to the \nradiant heat from the payload fairing internal surfaces. Maximum temperatures on the \ninner wall, of a Delta-ll vehicle range from 25 to 50\u00b0 C. We also check radiated heat \nfrom the payload fairing or d~rs and free-molecular heating from'rarefied air hitting \nthe spacecraft after the payload fairing is jettisoned. When we use an upper stage, we \nhave to consider the thennal effects from being exposed to the space environment \nduring the parking and transfer-orbit phases. The Shuttle flights require similar analy-\nses. We must consider any extended time the payload is aboard the Orbiter and the \nstandard abort scenarios. We review results from these analyses to chart effects on \nmission operations and to constrain the time that the payload is exposed to the Sun or \ndeep space while in the Orbiter bay. \n\nSeveral static and dynamic loads affect the structures of the payload, adapters, and \nlaunch vehicle. These loads are either aerodynamic or they depend on acceleration and \nvibration. Aerodynamic loads are a function of the total pressure placed on the vehiCle \nmoving through the atmosphere. They consist of a static (ambient) pressure and a' \ndynamic pressure (tile pressure component experienced by a fluid when brought to \nrest). The relationship between altitude and velocity on the ascent trajectory deter-\nmines these pressures. Payload fairings protect against dynamic pressure up to stated \nlimits. (If strong winds on launch day result in excessive shear loads, the launch must \nbe postponed:) At some point in the ascent trajectory the dynamic pressure will drop \nto levels which will not damage an unprotected payload; this results from the atmo-\nspheric density decreasing with altitude. At this point the fairing may be jettisoned to \nlighten the load on the booster. Typically payload fairings are not jettisoned until the \ndynamic pressure drops to 05 N/m2. \n\nDuring ascent a pressure dif(erential occurs between the inside and outside of the \nfairing because the ambient atmospheric pressure continuously drops with altitude \nwhile the fairing contains higher-pressure air. Air trapped in compartments and crev-\nices within the fairing and the spacecraft is at a higher pressure until the fairing vents \nto the outside. The venting rate depends on the pressure differential between intemaI \n\n739 \n18.3 \n\nDetermining the Spacecraft Design Envelope and Environments \n\nd com artments and the fairing, as well as the pressure differential ~tween the \npayloa e encl:sed within the fairing and the external environment.

Shock Environments for Launch Systems Caused by Staging and Separation \nEvents. \n\nThe acoustic environment is a function of the physical configuration of the launch \nvehicle, its acceleration time history, and the configuration of the propulsion system. \nThe near-launch-pad acoustic environment depends on the refl~ soun~ energy \nfrom the launch pad structures and facilities. The maximum dynamtc enVll'onment \nis a consequence of the rate of acceleration and the aerodynamic s~thness of \nthe launch vehicle shape. Solid-rocket boosters and first stages (often combmed) ~u\u00ad\nally provoke a more severe environment, and the smaller the launch vehicle, \nthe more stressed the payload. In general, the closer the payload is to the launch pad, \nthe more severe the acoustic environment prior to releasing the launch vehicle, and the \nmore rapidly the vehicle accelerates, the more severe the environment at maximum \ndynamic pressure. Since the acoustic excitation is rapidly time-varying, we m~t \ndesign for the instantaneous values and the overall average. When. the. paylo~ desIgn \nis sensitive to the acoustic environment, it is common to add dampmg msulation to the \nfairing. Figure 18-12 shows the acoustic environments of several launch vehicles. \n\n\n\nr \nI( \n\nI \n\n! \nI \nI \n\nI \n\n742 Launch Systems \n18.3 \n\n145 \n\n140 \n\n135 ~ I\"-. \n\n130 Y/ ---. ~ ....., 0... 1\\ - Allasl 1:J1 dB Overall \n/ ::;...- \"l IJ- TIIan SPL 125 \n\ndB 120 \n\n-~ \\ \n~ ~ ~\\ \n\n....., \n........... \n\n142 dB \n\n115 \n\n110 \n\n105 \n\n100 \n31.5 \n\nRg.18-12. \n\n~ ~ \n~ ~ \n\n.- Della 792x\u00b79 139.8 dB \n\n<>- Della 792x-l0 144.5 dB \n\n\"\"\"~ ~ \n.- ShuI1!e 138 dB \n\n~ \n63 125 250 500 1,000 2,000 4,000 8,000 \n113 0cIave Band ~ Center Fn!qUency \n\nAcousUc Environments of Typical Launch ConfigUrations Th \nrepresent the sound pressure/eve/ (SPL) of the acoustic energy at \u00b7one-: :es \nntervals for typical launch configurations.

' \n\n-\n\nLaunch Vehicle User Guides 743 \n\nPotential integration functions at the launch site include mating the spacecraft with \na stage vehicle, spin tests, loading propellants, mating with the launch vehicle, and \nprelaunch testing of all systems (integrated test). Two items to consider are the launch-\nsite layout and how to integrate the payload and launch vehicle. A launch site may \nhave several pads, so we can integrate several spacecraft at the SaDIe time. Others may \nhave one pad that restricts the flow to one payload at a time. If the launch site uses a \nseries approach, launch delays and failures in one spacecraft or launch system may \nadversely impact the next program. \n\nVarious launch systems use vastly different approaches to physically integrate the \npayload and the launch vehicle. The most common is vertical integration, which \nmeans erecting the booster and hoisting the payload on top of it. With this method, we \nmust build platforms at various levels so we can get to the entire launch vehicle, stage \nvehicle, and payload. This approach works. but it is fraught with resbicted access and \nsafety problems. Another way is horizontal integration, which means securing the \nlaunch vehicle in a horizontal position and attaching the spacecraft. This approach \neases access and lessens safety concerns. Actual payload processing varies according \nto the complexity of the spacecraft, and should be examined case\u00b7by-case. The time \nrequired at the launch site depends on its design, interface requirements, integrated test \nrequirements, amount of shared resources, and the launch-site operator's philosophy \nand approach. \n\nFollowing the process defined in this chapter, you should be able to identify several \nacceptable launch systems for a particular mission and establish preliminary design \nrequirements for the spacecraft. The process is an iterative one, and you will probably \nneed to use it several times prior to converging on the spacecraft design and launch \nvehicle. \n\nLaunch Vehicle User Guides \n\nAriane 4.

Each spacecraft is essentially unique, and is manufactured and tested \nappropriately. Commercial satellites, while alleviating some of the major impedances \nto fast and efficient satellite manufacture, have fared only slightly better. The advent \nof commercial constellations of satellites forces us to seek and develop completely \nnew strategies. We need to incorporate ideas and methods from other industries into \nsatellite supply-chains to meet the cost and cycle-time requirements needed to make \nspace systems compete effectively with their terrestrial counterparts. \n\nThis chapter describes a few of the vital changes that need to be addressed to man-\nufacture and test multiple satellites efficiently. These methods and strategies apply to \nthe whole satellite supply chain, and to piece-part, assembly, subsystem, and space-\ncraft levels.

Designing manufacturable satel-\nlites and associated production systems requires up-front investments in time, money, \nand capital. Each program needs to trade the benefits of these methods with anticipated \ninvestment costs. As the number of satellites grows, the benefits and the usefulness of \nthese methods increases.

The majority of the chapter then \nconcentrates on four phases of the manufacturing and test of the spacecraft constella_ \ntion: (1) creating the manufacturing vision, (2) influencing the design, (3) developing \nand verifying the process, and (4) producing the spacecraft. \n\n19.1.1 Challenges for Manufacturing, Material, Test, \nand Launch Processing Teams \n\nThe challenges presented to the manufacture of satellite constellations are \nextremely different from those traditionally conceived for spacecraft. These chal-\nlenges, however, are not muc~ different from those for other commercial products. \nSpacecraft are designed and built to cost and schedule goals-just like video recorders \nor cars. Figure 19-1 compares a few of the challenges facing the manufacture of a \nconstellation of satellites, while Fig. 19-2 shows manufacturing issues as they pertain \nto key metrics-quality, time, and cost. \n\nKey Metrics \n\nQuality \n\nSpacecraft Cost \n\nCycle TIme (Integration) \n\nCycle TIme (Build to launch) \n\nTraditional \n\nBuild, Test, RebUIld, Retest \u2022.. \n\n66,ooo$/l<g \n\n225 days \n\n18 months \n\nMultl-sateilite \n\nBuild, Verify, Ship, Shoot \n\n19,8OO$/kg \n\n24 days \n\n2 months \n\nRg.19-1.

Constellation Manufacturing Issues. The quality, cycle time, and cost issue relating \nto the prodUction of a constenation of satellites are different than those encountered \nwhile producing single sateHites. While quality requirements are different-but stiR \nstringent~1e time and cost issues are now paramount. \n\nFor instance, time to market often is not only a goal, but a competitive requirement \nfor viability. Time becomes an overriding factor. This drives not only the overall time \nto market. but the time to complete each system element. For manufacturing, this \ntranslates to drastically reducing the cycle time required to produce a satellite. \n\nQuality, as with all spacecraft, is still imperative. Satellites are not field serviceable, \nand simple defects can render a satellite unusable. The traditional approach places \nemphasis on high-cost and time-consuming quality assurance methods that check and \nrecheck, test and retest. and verify and reverify the hardware. Instead, we employ six-\n\nsigma me~ods to .verify that the processes are perfonning with high-quality results. \nRobust designs USlDg in-control processes will produce high-quality products-with-\nout associated high costs and long cycle times. Six-sigma methods are a cornerstone \nfor lean and agile manufacturing methods (see sidebar). \n\nTo meet the additional cycle-time and quality requirements, manufacturing person-\nnel must participate concurrently during the creation of the design. They ate responsi-\nble for influencing the design and tailoring the design into a final. producible product. \nFinally, manufacturing must effectively integrate the product during production. \n\nIn summary, the challenges presented to manufacturing are to recreate the value-\nadded or useful elements of space hardware design and manufacture. We must elimi-\nnate non-value-added activities. We must add elements for quick, efficient. and high \nquality execution. We must drive out non-value-added or superfluous activities and \nrequirements. \n\nThe Six Sigma program began in Motorola in 1985 as a means to measure and improve \nperformance in all phases of its business. The ultimale target is virtually perfect execution. \n\nSigma (0) is used to designate the distribution or spread about the mean or avemge of any \nprocess or procedure. A simple definition of six sigma is 3.4 defects per million opportunities, \nor 99.9997% perfect. Sigma level improvement is not linear. In fact, improvement rates \nescalate rapidly as the base sigma level slowly increases. \n\nSix Sigma methodologies are a set of tools and procedures to improve processes. Funda-\nmental methods include problem solving, process control and process characlerization. They \ncan be applied to any process from engineering to business. For more information, reference \nHarry [1997] or Hany and Lawson [1997]. \n\n------------------------------\nMaterial Challenges \n\nTraditional manufacturing drove spacecraft parts to the costliest and slowest-\ndelivery grade-S-level. Unfortunately, these parts are not inherently better than com-\nmercial parts-they have just been screened for various properties to improve their \noverall expected performance or failure rates. The parts are mostly produced on \ncommercial part lines and even from commercial part batches. \n\nOur challenge is to use the right parts for the mission-not the highest level parts \navailable. We need to target commercial parts, replacing them only when required. We \nneed to discourage military grade or S-level parts, but allow them in situations where \nthey must be used. A simple comparison of part costs, as shown in Fig.19-3, depicts \nthe drastic difference for S-level, Mil-spec, and commercial parts. Significant cost \nsavings can result from selecting lower-cost parts when applicable. As discussed in \nSec. 12.2, significant time savings also can result from selecting lower grade parts. \nThis yields a significant advantage of using Mil-spec parts over S-level parts. Further-\ning this comparison, we can receive commercial parts typically even quicker-often \nin less than a week. \n\nParts selection needs to consider producibility, radiation, out-gassing, and other \nrequirements. We need to consider strongly parts that support efficient manufacturing \nmethods. We should target parts that use the standard process flows-for instance, \nautomated placement and mass reflow for electronic assemblies. \n\nFmally, parts selection needs to be a value-added concurrent engineering activity. \nSuccess\u00b7 in the material area heavily influences overall program cost and schedule \nperfonnance. \n\n\n\n748 \n\n0.9 \n\n0.8 \n\n~ 0.7 \n0.6 \n\n1 .!! 0.5 \no \n'0 0.4 \n~ 0.3 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.1 \n\no \n\nSpace Manufacturing and ReHability \n\nMixer (SMA86) \n\n.S-Ievel \n\n~MII \n\no CommercIaJ \n\nLC.(lM139) \n\n19.1 \n\nFIg. 19-3.

These methods can \nbe appDed to the production of satellites as well. See Womack et aI. [1990) for in depth \ndiscussion of lean manufacturing. \n\nIn summary, test provides possibly the greatest opportunity for significant cost and \ncycle-time improvements. Intelligent selection of reduced testing, clear distinction \nbetween design and process verification, and performance of lowest-level testing \ngreatly enhances the cost-effective, high quality,low cycle-time production of space-\ncraft without significantly increasing risk. \n\nLaunch Processing Challenges \nAfter finishing integration and test, we package and ship the satellites to the launch \n\nsite for processing and preparation for launch. Traditionally, this has been a complex \nand time-consuming segment of the \"satellite delivery process. The requirements for \nbuilding a multi-satellite constellation include quick and efficient processing of satel-\nlites for launch. These requirements may also force the use of multiple launch sites and \nlaunch-preparation areas, further driving the need for standardized and simplified \nlaunch processing. \n\nWe need to consider launch-site pJ10Cessing from the start of the program. We \nshould target decisions and trades that support simplified processing. Changes and \nprocessing are much easier to handle while at the integration factory. This is where the \nfacilities and skill levels are the most available. Launch-site processing typica1ly takes \nplace at a remote location-often not owned or operated by the satellite manu-\nfacturer-that makes processing more difficult. J \n\nThe spacecraft are transported to the launch-site processing area via protected \\ \" \nenvironment or container. The container environment must provide for temperature, . /\" \nhumidity, vibration, and shock protection during the shipping process. In oroer to \nsupport the streamlined processing of the satellites upon their arrival, the shipping \nprocess is subject to basic process control. We deem the process to be successful as \nlong as the required parameters-temperature limits, humidity limits, vibration levels, \nand shock levels-are not exceeded. If these parameters exceed their limits, we need \nto perform in-depth analysis or additional testing at the launch-site. But, if none of the \nparameters are exceeded. the satellite can continue with the streamlined process flow \nthat contains little, or preferably no, testing. \n\n\n\nI \nI \nI; \n\nI' \nI I, \nI \nI \n\nI \n\n750 \nSpace Manufacturing and ReUability \n\n19.1 \n\nFigure 19-5 depicts a streamlined launch-site \n~I the steps needed to prepare the spacecraft ~ ~ow.

In today's \n\ncompetitive environment, these areas are everything. Many times multiple companies \nhave similar ideas and the only differentiating characteristic between their products is \nwhich one makes it to the consumer market first and captures the majority of the \nmarket share. Missing the time to market goals will cost a company market share, \nrevenue and brand equity. Therefore we need to know up front when our product must \nbe ready for our customer and then determine our cycle time goals to support this \noverall schedule. \n\nAs stated previously, one of the unfortunate aspects of building satellites is that they \nare usually not field serviceable. If there is a quality problem after we launch the prod-\nuct into space, we have to live with the degraded performance or,in an extreme case, \naccept that the product does not meet our mission requirements. We must establish \nquality goals so that we can design our product accordingly. When we choose compo-\nnents for our product and select processes to build and test o~product, we determine \nour resulting quality levels. As we choose components and processes we need to \ncalculate our cumulative quality predictions and track them to our goals. We will then \nhave the visibility to see what components and processes have a positive or negative \nimpact on the overall product quality. With this data we now make informed trade-off \ndecisions. We can determine which components or processes to change to increase the \nproduct quality. Often quality drives cycle time. If a product is designed with low qual-\nity levels then we should expect to perform more rework and additional testing. This \nin tum adds cycle tiine. Haroware designed around robust processes which exhibit low \ndefect rates result in pI'oducts with fewer defects which leads to less test time, less \nrework and lower costs. . \n\nMost customers desire low-cost solutions. More and more of the traditional \"cost \nplus\" projects are being proposed as fixed price contracts. The days of cost-plus \ncontracts and cost overruns being absorbed by the customer are quickly disappearing. \nToday the contractor carries the burden of performing to an agreed-upon fixed price. \nBecause of this, the contractor must know the cost goals arid understand how they are \ngoing to perform to these cost goals. Performance to cost goals directly relates to \nperformance to cycle time goals and quality goals. The addition of unplanned cycle \ntime and of effort l'equired to correct quality problems result in increased cost. In \ngeneral any unplanned work results in additional cycle time and in additional costs. \n\nInvolve Manufacturing Early \n\nManufacturing early involvement may not always be the accepted way of doing \nbusiness. Early manufacturing involvement allows the design team to be informed \nregal'ding the effects of their choices on doWllstream manufacturing and test opera-\ntions. It empowers the design team to make informed decisions and predetermine the \nexpected cycle time, quality and cost performance of the assembly and test operations. \nIt allows management to be aware of what to expect when the product reaches assem-\nbly and test. \n\nGetting the design team to accept concurrent engineering can be a difficult task. \nMany times a company needs a culture change for everyone to embrace the early \nparticipation of manufacturing. Management must support concurrent engineering and \nmust pay attention to the analysis results created by the manufacturing representatives. \nThe manufacturing and test participants on the concurrent-engineenng team must \nembrace the manufacturing vision and possess the tools to influence the design to meet \n\n\n\n~i \nIi 752 Space ManufacturiJJg and ReHabillty 19.1 \n\nthis vision. They must show the other members of the design team that their participa-\ntion is value-added and that early team involvement will save the program time and \nmoney in the long run. Everyone on the project team must share the manufacturing \nvision in order for it to become reality. \n\nSelect Parts and Processes Effectively \n\nAs was discussed earlier the sum of the project's individual process cycle times \n(both design and manufacturing/test) must support the overall cycle time goals and the \nmanufacturing vision. Cycle time is inherent in the design. We predetermine the cycle \ntime to assemble and test a product when we choose parts and processes for a \nparticular product. Therefore, during the product design phase we must give appro.. \npriate detail to the proper selection of parts and processes. Overall the design team \nmust realize that a design consists of parts and processes. Often the choice of a \nparticular part will dictate the use of a particular process. This relationship is what \ngave rise to the phrase ''pick a part, pick a process\". Often design engineers choose \nparts that meet a limited set of criteria from which the design engineer is searching. \nThey often do this without knowing the downstream impacts that these part choices \nhave in assembly and test. \n\nTherefore it's important to have manufacturing and test representatives involved in \nthe part selection process. They can perform analyses to show how certain parts may \nrequire additional process steps which have lower process yields leading to more \ndefects, higher cycle times and ultimately higher costs. \n\nAn electronic assembly example of this type of analysis is shown in Table 19-1. We \ncan extend this analysis to satellite design and manufacture. Part X and part Y are \nequivalent in the areas of form, fit and function; therefore we would assume that the \nparts are interchangeable. However the parts vary greatly when we address associated \nprocesses, process yields and overall cost Part X is an 84-lead ceramic quad flat pack \nthat must have the leads formed, trimmed, and tinned. The part must then be loaded \ninto a tray for presentation to the part placement (pick and place) equipment. Form, \ntrim, tin and tray placement are non-preferred processes. We must perform these \nprocesses in-house, which contributes to increased process time for that part type. The \nlow process yields associated with these non-preferred processes drive this part to con-\ntribute 0273 defects per unit (OPU) which leads to increased cycle time and costs \nassociated with rework and potential test failures. Part Y is an 84-lead plastic quadflat \npack that comes to us formed, trimmed, tinned and loaded on tape and reel to be \npresented to the pick and place machine. This part uses only preferred processes which \nleads to lower process cycle times, lower defects per unit and lower rework costs. All \nof these factors are reflected in the lower total cost of Part Y. Therefore when selecting \na part the design team must look at the downstream impact of their part selection and \ninclude the total cost impact of the part in their design tradeoffs. \n\nBy relating parts to processes we can determine the expected time to manufacture \nand test a product, the associated quality level and the overall cost. Once we make \nthese estimates we can perfonn ''what if' analyses to see if other part/process combi-\nnations will make attaining the cycle time, quality and cost goals more realistic. We \nperform this iterative process early in the design phase, so we can include many design \ntradeoffs between aU of the disciplines. \n\nParts have many attributes that influence the effectiveness of manufacturing \nprocesses. Some of these attributes fall into the categories of cost, interchangeability, \navailability, reliability and simplicity.

Typically this meant that \nthe processes were highly flexible, required specially skilled workers. lacked good \n~ontrol and -:vere. seldom characterized. Today with the advent of concurrent engineer-\nmg,. w~ desIgn m the controlled and repeatable manufacturing processes from the \nbegmmng and the manufacturing output is highly predictable. \n\nCo?current engineering has brought about a change of attitude regarding manu-\nfacturing processes in the aerospace industry. No longer do we perform processes just \nbeca~ \"that is the way we've always done them.\" High-quaIity processes are char-\nacterized, controlled and repeatable. Many of these processes have been borrowed \n~m the commerci~ manufacturing world. The mass reflow of electronic assemblies \nI~ an .example of.this exchange. Mass reflow--t1te mass soldering of parts on printed \nC1fCwt boards usmg a single, controlled thermal cycle-was developed to efficiently \nproduce electronic products for delivery to consumers. Although slow in gaining \naccep~ce, we now use it for spaceflight hardware and other high reliability \napplicatiOns. \n~e concurrent manufacturing engineer should never be afraid to ask ''why'' we \n\n?eslgn ?r process something the way we do. An example of this is to look at the \nIDte~tion of dep!oyables on a satellite. In the past certain deployables have always \nbeen mtegrated WIth the satellite in the vertical position. This was done to minimize \n!he amount o~ stress that coul? be preloa~ into the deployable mechanisms.

With today's modem analysis tools much of the \ns~es associated with preloading the deployable mechanisms in the horizontal posi-\ntion can be modeled and the risks analyzed. If the risks are determined to be low \nen~u~ then th: satellite plane change from horizontal to vertical can be eliminated. \nThis ~l save time, space, and tooling and also reduce handling risk. \n\nTypI~ally satellite manufacturing has been a low-volume process. Currently many \ncO.mpames are Pf?posing multi-satellite constellations. These multi-satellite projects \ndrive\"manufac~g \"to create production lines for assembling and testing satellites. \nThe ~~bly lme concept of these satellite production lines has roots in the \nautomotiv~ mdustry. Many of the new satellite production lines take mass production \nassem?ly l~e ~hnology one-step further and implement many of the \"lean\" manu-\nJactunng ~ctpl.es ~?t1y used in the automotive industry. Some of these \"lean\" \nmanufa~turin~ pnnctples mclude Just In Time suppliers, supplier partnering concur-\nrent engmeenng, pull production,\" and statistically controlled processes ' \n\nOther satellite manufacturers have taken the ''lean'' manufacturing ~hilosophy to \nth~ n~xt step-~agile\" manT4acturing. \"Agile\" manufacturing incorporates all of the \npnnctples used m \"lean\" manufacturing with the addition of flexibility.

We must evaluate all of the processes associated .W!~ assem~ly and test \n. terms of value-added activities and non-value-added actiVIties. During process \n:evelopment and implementation, we should maximize the value-added processes and \nthe non-value-added activities should be minimized. Reduction of the non-value-\nadded process steps will drive w~te e~ati~n. . . \n\nReduction in the number of mspection pomts IS a good e~ample of waste e~-\nination. Typically satellite production programs have had a high content of. quality \ninspection points. Inspection points are ex~ples of non-value-added operations- In \nthe past multiple inspection points were required because the assembly ~ ~ere \nhighly variable and uncontrolled. By institutionalizing concurrent engmeenng, \nprocesses are now designed into the assembly flow that are controlled and ~Ie. \nBecause the output of these processes are predictable, we ~o longer need multiple \ninspection points. Therefore we eliminate waste by removmg the non-value-added \n\ninspection steps. . ' . \nAnother non-value-added recurnng process IS test. Because test IS non-~a1u:-\n\nadded, we need to be minimize it to eliminate waste. Although some t:&ting IS \nrequired. we should minimize redundant testing. One of the benefits ~f us1l!g con-\ntrolled and repeatable processes is that the output from these ~ IS predictable. \nTherefore we don't have to test something that has been tested earlier if we know that \nthe processes used after the initial test have not inj~ variab~l?' ~to !he product. A \n\nood example of this principle is the previously-mentioned minimiZation of launch-\n~te processing. We test the spacecraft prior to shipping it to the launch ~te. and don't \ntest it at the launch site unless shipping indicators or sensors show that It exceeded a \n\nshipping process limit. . ' \nTest is just another process. During the early phases of desIgn, we should VI~w ~ \n\nassembly and test efforts as processes that must be con~olled and repeatable. Similar \nto satellite manufacturing processes, we should be establIsh goals ~or all test processes. \nThese goals should relate to cycle time, quality ~c~ed test. Yl~lds), and cost.

Traditional satellite manufacture and mass production in general IS based on a push system. \nIn other words, the material and work-in-process is generally pushed or ~ thro:ugh the \nsystem. The empbasis is on processing the hardware through the productlon line as qmckly as \npossible. Unfortunately. this can create pockets of ineffici~ncy and bottlenec:ks (throughput \nlimiters).

Therefore it is important to design in \naccessibility at the higher levels of integration. We may need this accessibility to \nrepair a defect that has passed undetected through a lower level test operation or to \nincorporate late design modifications prior to sealing the satellite. Design for acces-\nsibility needs to be a goal of the program vision because it doesn't happen without \nconscious effort. For a detailed discussion of process design and production trends, see \nShunk [1992]. \n\n19.1.3 Intluencing the Design \n\nSuccess of production depends on the manufactwinglproduction disciplines being \ninvolved throughout the product design. Through concurrent engineering, we develop \nthe product involving various disciplines of the trade. For satellite design, this includes \nsuch expertise as electrical, mechanical, software, test, industrial, and reliability \nengineering; it also includes other less-technical but equally important functions such \nas contracts, finance, procurement and scheduling. The manufacturing role, in partic-\nular, acts as the main interface between many product teams due to their direct respon-\nsibility of ensuring a producible product. All experts must get involved with the design \nearly and continually to the extent they can influence the product to meet their respec-\ntive goals or to compromise with others. At the very least, if the experts can't reach an \nacceptable term, they can highlight the issue very early in the program so that they can \ncontinually work it into an acceptable term. \n\nTo influence the design, the program team must first establish a common vision for \nthe enterprise. This common vision serves to create a working platfonn that allows the \nsupply chain to collectively communicate. It provides the central theme to which the \nprogram will focus regardless of where anyone's portion of the business is located. \nThe common vision creates the need for goals and guidelines in each concurrent \ndesign area within the program. Overarching goals must be established to provide \nincentive for the program; they should be difficult to attain, yet attainable within the \nprogram life. \n\nTo supplement the goals, the team must establish specifically defined rules and \nguidelines to bring the goals to fruition. The vision, goals, and guidelines provide the \nprogram with a standard, central direction that, in turn, provides the program with the \nopportunity to be efficient and united. The intention of a common vision is not to strip \nindividual company identity, rather to converge on certain business ideas that alleviate \nchallenges due to diverse mindsets, backgrounds, and corporate cultures. \n\nDesigning to goals and guidelines sounds simple but may be difficult in practice; \nfew programs have these clearly outlined at the inception of the program. implement-\ning goals at the beginning of the program is where they are most effective. Studies \nhave shown that approximately 70% of the cost of the system is fixed by the end of the \nconceptual design phase [Wade and Welch, 1996]. \n\nA concept becomes feasible through refinement and, in turn, producible through \nother iterations of refinement If we initiate the guidelines of design at the conceptual \nlevel, it is less costly and less painful to iterate to a feasible design. The cost to correct \nproblems occurring from a previous program phase increases by an order of magni-\ntude, approximately (Fig. 19-7). A simple design change during the conceptual design \nphase will cost lOx during broadband phase and l00x during engineering model \nphase. \n\n19.1 \n\nt; \n0 \n0 \nI&. \n0 \n#-\nw \n> \n\n5 \n::l \n::i \n::l \n0 \n\nDesigning Space Systems for Manufacturability \n\n100 \n\n80 \n\nCost Reduction \nOpportunItieS \n\n757 \n\nRg.19-6. \nAdapted from Wade and Welch [1996).

This information encompasses the expectations for both parts and \nprocesses as these two ingredients form a product. It also provides structure for the \nproduct to grow properly since it addresses quality, capabilities, production rates, \nfacility requirements, procurement, cost, warranty, manufacturability, testability, etc. \nFor example, The design dictates product quality. If the product has a 2-sigma design. \nthe best we can expect is a 2-sigma product. \n\nKnowing the expectations initially not only assists the product to mature into pro-\nduction, and assists the product team to develop. Having these goals gives the team a \npurpose to commonly focus their attention. Successful teamwork resolves issues \nseemingly otherwise unresolvable. Communication becomes clearer and less conflict-\ning because the team uses common terms to explain the common goals. A good prod-\nuct team forms to produce a working product without relying upon functional titles and \npositions. Additionally, trust forms within the team. Yet, trust and competition are not \nmutually exclusive. Team members may and will form partnerships with competitors \nfor different projects or products, but this practice must not hinder the primary busi-\nness relationships. Lack of trust causes program inefficiencies. \n\nInitially, the prime contractor must derive the goals and guidelines; however, the \nsuppliers must then work closely with the prime contractor to further develop, \nunderstand and modify the expectations as necessary. In any event, if team members \ndon't understand or believe the goals, the team's ability to influence the design is \ndiluted, and the prime contractor must begin to educate them about the goals. \nFurthermore, it is especially important to derive the goals so they are meaningful. For \nexample, assembly time of a high volume, high complexity product (indicative of the \nconstellation satellite industry) typically comprises less than 35% of the overall cycle \ntime while production test comprises the remaining 65% (Olivieri [1997]). Using the \nPareto approach we find that the greatest opportunity to influence the design is in \nproduction test'\". \n\nDesign influence is most effective through mathematical analysis. Personal bias \nand tradition are not the basis for influence. When we select a part for a product, we \ninherently select the process as well. This means that predicting behaviors (quality, \nreliability, cycle time, assembly process, etc.) of the product is possible. We do this by \ncollecting data from suppliers but where data is not available we either run an experi-\nment or locate like-product data. Key predictions include, but are not limited to: defect \nper unit, defects per million opportunities, statistical tolerance and variability assess-\nments, design to unit production cost, solids modeling, cycle time, process modeling \nand mapping, design of experiments, and simulations. \n\nHaving the data equates to having the knowledge to influence design. The only way \nwe achieve key goals in areas such as quality, manufacturability, and profit is if they \nare designed in. \n\nInfluencing the design is an enterprise challenge. Awareness of our up and down \nstream product map helps us make smart decisions for the overall progtam. Locally \n\n\u2022 The Pareto Principle \nIf we rank order contributors to a problem from greatest influence to least influence, the \n\nPareto Principle states that only a few of the contributors will comprise the bulk of the influ-\nence. In general, 80% of the contribution comes from 20% of the factors. Pareto analysis is a \ntechnique for ranking items according to their contribution and analyzing the top contributors, \nor the \"vital few.\" The other 80% of the factors that only influence 20% of the contribution \nare the \"trivial many.\" \n\nDesigning Space Systems for Manufacturabllity \n759 \n\n19.1 \n\n. bl e and other areas of importance, does 110t \naJ{.iJnizing cycle time, quality, assem\n\nth \nyeas\n\nrall \ngram Standardiiation of analysis \n\nm . d th same benefit to e ove pro . h \u2022 \nalways pro.VI e::s d . delines help to relate design impacts to the supply c alD. \ntools, metncs, go ,an gut \n\n14 Process Development and Verification .

These areas include supply-chain management \nand production floor management. \n\nSupply-cluzin Management \nA supply-chain focus is key to the successfully executing the production phase of \n\na multiple satellite program. The supply-chain is defined as all of the suppliers and \nactivities involved with producing a satellite. This involves the major suppliers-bus, \npayload, and antennas-and the minor suppliers. \n\nCommunicating and coordinating across the supply-chain is critical. Fundament-\nally, all the suppliers need to have a common vision and sense of direction. In effect, \nthe major suppliers become partners. Openly communicating goals, expectations, and \nproblem solving is essential. To facilitate communication, we need to seek a common \nlanguage and culture through common training and team building. The resulting pro-\ngram culture program can be built on the strengths of each partner. \n\nConcurrent engineering across company lines must occur. All company sections \nmust share the key design rules or characteristics early in the process and maintain \nthem throughout the program. We must carefully define and fully understand the \n_interfaces and handoffs. We should develop and use common tooling and processes. \nFor instance, shipping containers carrying subassemblies to final integration should \nsupport integration activities without a tooling transfer. They should seamlessly \nintegrate into the factory. Finally, common metries across the supply-chain allow for \nmeaningful summation of data, so managers can judge the overall system health. \nThese metrics should center around quality, cycle time, and critical parameter \nperformance. \n\nProduction Floor Management \nPerformance and executing the production phase uses principles similar to any \n\nproduction environment. In addition to supply-chain management, consistent perfor-\nmance takes lean manufacturing principles of production floor management, including \ngood processes, qualified workers, and timely information. \n\nShort-cycle, well understood processes and overall processing is fundamental to \nlean manufacturing. Simulation or other flow design tools help to determine optimum \nproduction flows that reduce the risks of production delays. The flows and processing \nshould include Just In Time concepts to minimize Work In Process inventory and \nimprove quality and cycle time. Just In Time binges on delivering material items when \nthe flow needs them in a pull fashion. We don't move items until they are ready for \nprocessing. Less hardware is in process, thereby reducing the potential for damage and \nreducing overall floor space requirements. \n\nQualified workers that understand the processing of space hardware are still \nrequired for satellite production. While still required, their roles and specific skills are \nvery different than traditional programs. Highly specialized and narrowly skilled \npositions now become broader and more generalized. The design attributes resulting \nfrom a successful multi-satellite design team will require less intensive processing. \nWhile less difficult, the processing needs to be more repeatable. We can train or certify \nworkers for each repeatable operation, so the can typically monitor their own work. \nWe minimize quality inspections. Instead, the individual or the team is responsible for \nperforming each operation correctly and safely. \n\nThe capture and use of timely production data is a third production floor manage-\nment challenge. Producing multiple satellites with short cycle times requires us to \n\n\n\nr \n~ \n1 \nI' \nI \n\n762 Space Manufacturing and Reliability \n19.1 \n\ncollect, use, and archive data differently from traditional methods. Paper, the tradi-\ntional documentation medium, is too cumbersome, untimely, and not available to \nmultiple disciplines. COnstellations based on a large number of satellites require \nvolumes of data be available to multiple users. We need factory systems for work \ninstruction and process planning; transmittal of product data between suppliers, inte-\ngrators, and users; and for factory data collection. Factory data collection includes \ncalibration, as-built, work-in-progress tracking, and quality data and/or information. \nAn added advantage is using common tools for these functions across the supply_ \nchain. \n\n19.1.6 Summary \n\nThese methods apply exactly to multiple satellite constellations with communica-\ntions payloads. These methods were applied to the Iridium\u00ae program, with outstanding \ncost and schedule results. Constellation reliability and performance data is starting to \nbe collected at time of this pUblication. \n\nSmaller constellations, non-communication payloads, and high-value missions \nmay use subsets of these practices. In all cases, thoughtful selection of parts and \nprocesses and skillful application of concturent engineering practices are paramount \n\nMore detailed information regarding the application of these methods and subse-\nquent tradeoffs will become available as more constellations complete deployment \nCturently, competitive issues restrict information flow as much data is viewed as \nproprietary. \n\nThe lridium\u00ae Satellite Assembly Process \nThe Iridium\u00ae'\" Satellite Assembly Factory' comprises 15 process stations. These stations \n\ncomplete specific functions. The satellites flow from station to station throughout the factory \nuntil Station 15. At Station 15, workers pack and send the satellites to the launch-site. During \nsteady-state production, the total time to proceed from Station 1 to Station 15 is 24 days. \nStation 0: Material Receipt \n\nAll material and subsystems are received into the satellite factory. Major systems received \ninto the factory include: \n\n\u2022 Gateway antennas (4) \n\n\u2022 Crosslink antennas, fixed (2) and moving (2) \n\u2022 Panels (communications and gateway) \n\u2022 Main mission antennas (3) \n\u2022 Solar arrays (2) \n\n\u2022 Satellite bus assembly \n\nThe satellite bus assembly, complete with propulsion and guidance systems, is received, \nalready mounted on a wheel-mounted dolly. This dolly, COllabomtively developed for use \nthroughout the satellite delivery process, is used for satellite assembly, shipment, and launch-\nsite processing. The dolly also allows for access to all sides of the satellite via rotation, and can \nbe easily maneuvered through the factory. \n\n\u2022 Iridium\u00ae is a registered tmdemark and service mark of Iridium 1P LLC. \n\n19.1 Designing Space Systems for ManufactorabiJity 763 \n\n00 01 02 03 04 05 080708091 o 11 12 13 14 15 \nCommlncallons '0 Electronics \n\n0 ~ 0 0 ) I-- ) CommunIcatIons IV panel \n1 GatewaY 10 10 J\\II1BIlI18S \n\nP I':) K) - 10 GateWay Panel \n0 r 0 p 0 \"' p p p ) ( \\., space Vehicle - ~ Bus \n\n1 crosslink 10 t--0 J\\II1BIlI18S r \nEMITent 0 IV \n$hear Panels 10 ~ \n\nII'\" Main MIssIon 10 1\\.....1 AntennaS \nSolar Arrays 10 10 -\n\nStation 1: Heat-pipe Bonding ., nI that \n\u2022 \u2022 thermalI bonded to the communication panel.

When the switch that \ncontrols the bulb fails. the replacement is not quite as simple but still within the capa-\nbilities of most mechanically inclined teenagers and even some adults. We expect a \nbigher reliability of the switch than of the lamp because it requires more effort to repair \na failure. When a spacecraft command receiver fails on orbit, it takes an extra-\nordinarily long screwdriver to fix it. You get the general idea: the command receiver \nhas to be much more reliable than the light bulb or the switch on the desk lamp. This \nneed for very high reliability in all parts and subsystems of a spacecraft is the basis for \nincluding a reliability program in most space projects. \n\nBefore describing the details of the reliability program. let us briefly discuss the \nmeaning and metrics of reliability in the context of space missions. A common defi-\nnition of reliability is ''The probability that a device will function without failure over \na specified time period or amount of usage.\" [IEEE. 1984] Jf the phrase ''without fail-\nure\" is taken to mean ''without failure of any kind\" it defmes basic reliability; if it is \ninterpreted as ''without failure that impairs the mission\" it defines mission reliability. \nIn spacecraft that employ extensive redundancy there can be a significant difference \nbetween these two reliability metrics. Mission reliability is the more important \nconcept, and when we use ''reliability'' without a qualifier. it always means mission \nreliability. \n\nThe elementary expression for the reliability of a single item. not subject to wearout \nfailures, is \n\n(19-1) \n\nwhere A is the failure rate and t is the time. Here, R, is the probability that the item will \noperate without failure for time t (success probability). At this point we recognize only \ntwo outcomes: success and failure, and therefore the probability of failure, F, is given \nby: \n\nF=l-R (19-2) \n\nMore refined and practical methods of assessing mission success will be described \nlater. \n\nFor a spacecraft made up of n nonredundant elements, all equally essential for \nspacecraft operation, the system (or series) reliability, Rs. or success probability. is \ncomputed as \n\nn \nRs = II R; = e - LA;t (19-3) \n\n1 \n\nwhere R\nj \n(i = L.n) is the reliability and Aj the failure rate of the individual elements. \n\nFor failure-probabilities (At) less than 0.1 or reliability greater than 0.9, the following \n\n\u2022 Much valuable help in the formatting of this chapter was received from Emery L Reeves of \nthe U.S. Air Force Academy who also contributed the material for Table 19-6. \n\n\n\nr \nI \nI; \n\n766 \nSpace Manufacturing and ReHability \n\n19,2 \n\napproximation is frequently used \n\ne-At '\" 1 - A.t \nMost\" liabili\u00b7 (19-4) re ty computations particUlar I . . . \nabilities (which can be summed) rather th y ~~~ detailed desIgn, use failure prob-\n\nWhere a system consists of n elemen:. re a ty values (that must be multiplied) \nby itself satisfy the requirements thepa 'llll~ (parall;'l:_ ~~ .. each. of these elements can \n\n\" \"' 11 e or reuur,\"\",u) reliability, Rp, is given by \nn \n\nRp =1-II(l-R;) \nI (19-5) \n\nwhere the reliability of the parallel elements is equal, say R\na\n\n, the above simplifies to \n\nRp = 1 - (1 - Ra1 \nExamples of series and parallel structures are shown in Fig. 19-9. \n\n(19-6) \n\nCASE 1 \nSerIes Renabllity \n\nRS = Rc [1-(1- RA)(1- Ra>J \nCASE 3 \n\nParUaJ RedUndancy \n\nRS = 1 -(1- RAl(1- RB}(1- Rd \nCASE 2 \n\nParanel ReliabIlity = Full Redundancy \n\n~~ ~-----------.. ~~~----~ \n\nCASE 4 \nNon-Identical, Full Redundancy \n\nFIg. 19-9. :: :d:r::: :~ab~': ~O:~Js.

Frequently Used ReI/abIlity Concepts. Design life Is govemed by wear-out and \nexpendable stores. Mean mission duration Is less than design life because faDures \ncan terminate a mission before end-of-life conditions are reached. \n\nDesign life, the intended operational time on orbit (see Section 19.2.1), is an \nimportant parameter for the reliability program. It determines the amount of con-\nsumables (control gas, etc.) that must be provided and establishes quality and test \nrequirements for items subject to wearout, such as bearings and batteries. The mission \nreliability calculated at the design life is the mission success probability. Since this \nquantity is less than 1.0, the expected life is less than the design life. The customary \nmeasure of the expected life is the mean mission duration or MMD, given by: \n\nMMD=fTdR (19-7) \n\nwhere Trepresents a horizontal (time) line in the shaded area of Fig. 19-10 and dR is \nthe associated (vertical) increment in reliability. MMD is a frequently used figure of \nmerit for spacecraft reliability improvement programs. \n\nMost satellites perform multiple functions (e.g., weather observation and tracking \nocean traffic), and performance of any of these functions may still be useful even \nwhen it is degraded. Under such circumstances the success criteria are no longer ob-\nvious. Should failure be defined as the event when the spacecraft fails to furnish any \nuseful data, or should it be the point at which its performance deviates from any part \nof the specification? This problem can be addressed by establishing multiple reliabil-\nity requirements. Assume that the specified weather observations are intended to \\lSe \nthree frequency bands but that observations on even a single band are still useful. The \nsuccess probability (SP) requirement may be formulated as shown in Table 19-2. \n\n\n\n768 \nSpace Manufacturing and ReHabDity \n\nTABLE 19-2. Hypothetical Reliability Requirement for a Weather Satellite. \n\nCondition SP\u00b7 \nAt least 1 band operational \n\n0.98 \nAt least 2 bands operational \n\n0.92 \nAll 3 bands operational \n\n0.85 \n\u2022 Success Probability \n\nDuring the development of the satellite it may be found that it will be difficult to \nobtain a success probability for all three bands operational greater than 0.80 but that \nthe single band mission reliability can be raised to 0.99. If the requirements shown in \nTable 19-2 are part of a contractual document it may take lengthy negotiations to agree \non the change, even though it may be technically quite acceptable. To avoid such \nsituations, mission effectiveness rather than reliability may be Specified. There are \nseveral definitions of mission effectiveness [MIL-HDBK-338BJ, but all aim at a single \nmetric that represents reliability weighted by the operational capability level to which \nthe reliability is applicable. In the above example assume that the 1, 2, and 3 band \ncapabilities are assigned weights of 0.25, 0.35, and 0.4, respectively (it is desirable that \nthe weights add up to l.0). A simple mission effectiveness requirement may then be \nstated as 0.25 x 0.% + 0.35 x 0.92 + 0.4 x 0.85 = 0.902. A similar calculation shows \nthat raising the single band reliability to 0.99 will not compensate for reducing the \n3 band reliability to 0.80, but that this reduction could be tolerated if the 2 band reli-\nability is raised to 0.95 at the same time. Where there is\u00b7a sound technical basis for \nspecifying mission effectiveness it will generally reduce both cost and development \ntime compared to specifying multiple reliability values. As indicated in Fig. 19-10, the \neffectiveness curve will lie above the reliability curve when the latter is constructed \nfor an \"all\u00b7 up\" satellite. \n\n19.2.1 Design for Reliability \n\nThe process for designing a reliable system is shown in Table 19-3. Evidence that \nsimplicity makes for reliability can be seen in Table 19-4, which is excerpted from an \nearlier publication by the author of this section [Hecht and Hecht, 1985]. Complex \nfunctions had higher failure rates. In each case shown in the last columns of the table, \nthere were probably compelling reasons for using the more complex implementation, \nbut the reliability consequences of these decisions must also be recognized. \n\nTo make sure that the process leading to a reliable system is being carried out as \nintended, there must be an explicit assignment of responsibility for its implementation. \nSeveral alternatives for the assignment are listed in Table 19-5 in order of increasing \ndirect cost For very small satellites the low cost advantage of (A) or (B) will usually \noutweigh the benefits of the last two alternatives. When subsystems get more numer-\nous and larger, alternatives (C) and (0) may result in overall savings, in spite of their \nhigher immediate cost. \n\nThe activities liSted below are suitable for alternatives (B) or (C). Where alternative \n(A) is adopted, at least a Reliability Program Plan should be prepared and a Failure \nReporting System should be established. Alternative (0) implies that the program will \nbe managed by reliability specialists who will generate their own process require-ments. \n\n19.2 ReUabillty for Space Mission Planning 769 \n\nTABL E 19-3 Typical Steps for Achieving a Reliable System. \n\nProcess Steps DetaIls Found \n\n~eep it simple (every adcfrtlonal function increases the failure See Table 19-4 \nprobability) \n\nr- dequate strength (mechanical and electrical) of ail parts, Sec. 19.2.2 \n=;~ allowanca for unusuai loads that may be im~due \n\n'ronmentai extremes or failures In related campone toenVI \n\nSec. 19.2.3 'de alternative means of accomplishing the m~ esse':!ai \nProVl here design for excess strength Is not suitable ( is functions w \nincludes most electronics) \n\nPlan a test program to assure that the above objectives have Sec. 19.2.4 \nbeen achieved \n\nt- II ct and analyze of test and on-orbit failure data to guide Sec. 19.2.1 Co e .\u2022 I s \nfutUre designs and mIssIon p an \n\nTAB LE 19-4 Relationship Between Falfure Rate and Complexity. . \nSimple Complex \n\nSystem Type Fall Rate' Type Fall Rate' \n\nTelemetry Hardwired 0.034 Programmable 0.190 \n\nStabilization Gravity 0.038\u00b7 3-axis active 0.610 \nSpin 0.216 \n\nThermal Passive 0.084 Active 0.320 \n\n\u2022 per orbit-year \n\nTABLE 1 9-5 Alternative Assignments of Responsibility . \nAlternative Benefits Disadvantages \n\n(A) Designers responsible for No additionai staff Difficult to achieve uniformity; aiso \nreliability Familiarity with items limitations In (8) \n\nClear responsibility \n\n(8) Designers responsible All of the above plus No responsibility for subsystem \nwith policy guidance from some uniformity interactions, opportunity for analytic \nmanagement redundancy may be overlooked, little \n\nawareness of reliability tools \n\n(C) Designers responsible Uniform proceduras, Requires dedicated reDabiJity function, \nwith guidance from above cflSBdvantages possible confusion over responsibDity \nreliability organization largely overcome \n\n(D) Responsibl7ity in reliabl7ity Responsibility clearly Lower motivation for designers, \norganization defined, Interactions expense of reJlabDity organization. \n\nlikely to be Identified \n\nR lillbiJity Program Plan \ne \" . adds little to the cost and is recommended even ~o~ ~e \n\nA reliabllzty program plan .ft liability objectives, assigns responslbihty \nsmallest spacecraft program. ~t Spec1milest re for evaluating the achievements.

The most significant interfaces usually are with quality assur. \nance, test, configuration management. and thermal control. \n\nFailure Modes Analysis \nFailure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) can provide valuable \n\ninsights into how design decisions affect reliability. Typical benefits are \n\n\u2022 Exposing single point failme modes in a subsystem assumed to be redundant \n\n\u2022 Identifying opportunities for functional redundancy (see Sec. 19.2.3) \n\n\u2022 Permitting components to assume a safe mode in the absence of required sig. \nnals or power \n\nFailme modes are usually recorded at the part level, e.g., for a capacitor the failure \nmodes are open and short (sometimes a change in capacitance may also be recorded). \nFailure effects are assessed at the part level and also at higher levels such as assembly \nand major component or subsystem. The failme effect of a shorted capacitor may be a \nbias shift on a transistor (part level) which in turn cuts off the output of a demodulator \n(assembly level) and causes loss of voice communications (subsystem level). In addi\u00b7 \ntion, the FMECA forms usually contain fields for the method of detection and the \nmeans of failure alleviation. In our example, the detection may be by an output moni\u00b7 \ntor included in the demodulator, and the failure alleviation may be use of an alternate \nvoice channel. \n\nA probability is associated with each failure mode, and the probabilities of all fail-\nme modes that cause a given effect are added in a summary section of the FMECA. \nLoss of modulator output cited in the example may be caused by several failure modes \nof the demodulator components, and loss of the voice channel may be caused by fail\u00b7 \nure modes other than those in the demodulator. Although there may be considerable \nerror in the estimate of a given failure mode, these tend to be evened out when arriving \nat estimates of failure effects at the subsystem and higher levels. \n\nIn digital microcircuits it is usually not possible to conduct FMECA at the level of \nprimitive elements (gates or transistors) because there are too many of them and \nbecause causes of failure may affect multiple elements (e.g., voids in the oxide layer). \nThe FMECA may then be conducted at the function level, where functions are timers, \ncounters, and shift registers. Failure modes at the function level are generally not as \nwell known as those at the part level, and a single cause of failure may affect multiple \nfunctions. In assessing the effects of failure at the higher level it may therefore be \nadvisable to be conservative. \n\nSneak circuit analysis is usually considered a part of FMECA. This analysis \nestablishes that explosive or other one-shot devices will not be accidentally actuated, \nand that they will always be actuated when intended. A good guide to FMECA is \nMIL-STD-1629. \n\nFailure Reporting \nFailure Reporting and Corrective Action (FRACAS) is a key element in any reli\u00b7 \n\nability program because: \n\na. It informs concerned parties that a failure has been observed \n\nb. It furnishes a record through which trends and correlations can be evaluated \nat a future time (an example of a trend is that the probability of failme in-\n\nReUabDity for Space MIssion PlaDning 771 \n\ncreases after x hours of use; an example of a cmrelation is that part y fails \nduring a particular step in the test sequence). \n\nt f the predicted failure rates and is the basis for It pernn'ts reassessmen 0 .. c. odifi ti' ns of the fault avoidance or fault tolerance proVISIonS. \nconsequentm ca 0 \n\n. rdin the operating time of all units in service; usually by \nUses b and c req~ reco ma!tained for each part number, with separate records for \nmeans o~ an operating log . e action is ically also recorded on the failure ~g \neach se.;:.~ ~U:~=~tion man~ement in that it ~tabIishes atRwbat ~mt a \nform. 11~ a h been returned to operational status. eportmg on \nfailed component or ::c~= fu:re investigation of the effectiveness o~ the rep~ \nthe same form .also cti frequently involves two steps: in the fust. a failed part IS \naction.

It should also be mentioned that most software used in spacecraft is actually \nfirmware (programs furnished as read-only-memory chips). \n\nReliability assessment of software is not a precise science. The most widely ac-\ncepted techniques depend on test (very expensive if high levels of reliability are \nrequired) or on independent verification and validation (even more expensive and less \nlikely to yield a quantitative assessment). When software is simple and well structured \nits reliability is usually high and the cost of evaluation is low. \n\nCost effective software reliability assessment starts with an examination of the \nways in which software can impact the mission. A convenient format for this is a fault \ntree, as shown in Fig. 19-11. \n\nIn this example, the software failures that are most likely to lead to mission failure \nare: \n\n1. Complete halting of execution, e. g., due to being in an infinite loop or being \ndirected to an incorrect memory location. \n\n2.

As an example (from \n\n-HDBK-217F), the predicted base failure mte for a fixed film resistor at 40\u00b0 C and \n~ at 0.9 ~f ?lted power is 0.0022 x 10-6lhour. Selecting a higher mted resistor, for \n:hi~ the dISSIpated power co~titutes only 0.3 of mted power reduces this to 0.0011 \n\n1 1hour. !Jut further reductions are hard to achieve. A resistor for which the dissi-\npated power IS 0.1 of the mting still has a failure mte 0.0009 x 10-6lhour. Demted parts \nnot only cost .more, but are frequently larger and heavier than the ones that they \nreI?lace. Demtlng only reduces the failure probability with respect to the stress that is \n~mg ~mted In the example of the fixed film resistor, demting reduces the probabil-\nIty of failure due to power surges but it does not offer any protection against failures \ndue to ~ead breakage or corroded connections. \n\nE?~'ronmental protection can take the form of shock mounting cooling or h tin \nproVlSI?~, and .shiel~g against mdiation effects, Where demtin~ reduces the :u! \nprobability by. mcreasmg ~e strength of the components, environmental protection \nreduces the f~ure probability by reducing the stress levels. In many cases environ-\nmental protection. adds considemble weight, and this, mther than cost, hmits the \namount of protection that can be provided. \n\n775 \n19.2 \n\nReliability for Space Mission Planning \n\nCoding Techniques \nCoding provides robustness by permitting continued opemtion in the presence of a \n\ndefined spectrum of errors, primarily in memory and data transmission. Coding tech-\nniques are also available for detection or tolemtion of errors in arithmetic processors \nbut are seldom used in this capacity in spacecraft computers. \n\nThe important coding techniques are error detecting code and error correcting \ncode. The former isintended primarily for fault isolation (i. e., preventing an incorrect \nresult from being used in subsequent opemtions). The latter is a fault tolerance mech-\nanism that corrects a class of errors and permits operations to continue normally. All \ncodes require the addition of check bits to the bit pattern that represents the basic \ninformation. If there is agreement between the check and information bits, the data is \naccepted. If there is no agreement, the data is rejected (for error detecting code) or \ncorrected (for error correcting code). \n\nThe cost effectiveness of error correcting codes is shown in the following hypothet-\nical example for a commercial earth observation satellite. The payload computer's 4 \nmegabit dynamic random access memory has a mass of 400 gr. This memory (which \ndoes not incorpomte error correction or detection) is expected to sustain two ''upsets\" \nper orbit-year. Upon detection of an upset by ground monitoring, the memory is \nreloaded. an opemtion that typically loses data from two orbits. The expected mission \nincome is $1,000 per orbit. In the absence of error correction, the cost of memory \nupsets will therefore be $4,000 per year. The extra memory and coding/decoding chips \nwill add 100 gr. to the mass of the memory and will cost $1,000. The cost/mass ratio \nfor this satellite is $5,000 per kg, and thus the extra 100 gr will be equivalent to $500. \nIn this example the cost of the error correction will be paid for in less than one-half \norbit-year. As discussed in Sec. 8.1, the number of upsets to be expected depends on \nthe size and type of memory, the orbit, and the amount of shielding provided by the \nspacecraft structure and the memory enclosure. In most cases coding is found to be \nvery cost effective. \n\nPort Selection and Screening \nScreening (selection of parts by test) is a process that eliminates units that have a \n\nhigher likelihood of failing in service than the other units in the lot [Chan,I994]. \nWhereas demting reduces the probability of failure by moving the avemge strength of \nthe components higher, screening reduces the probability of failure by rejecting the \nlower tail of the distribution as shown in Fig. 19-12. A typical screening procedure for \nsemiconductors is to measure the leakage current at elevated tempemture. \n\nThe cost of screening is made up of two elements: the cost of the rejected product, \nand the cost of test. The cost effectiveness is high (1) for parts with an initially high \nfailure mte, (2) for modest reliability improvements (generally those in which not \nmore than 20% of the product is rejected), and (3) where the cost of test is small \ncompared to the unit cost of the product under test (not over 10%) \n\nScreening does not involve an increase in the size of the components and it is there-\nfore preferred to demting for bulky or heavy parts. Screening is not very effective for \nreducing the failure probability in a mode for which components have been demted \nbecause the failure probability due to external stresses in that mode is already very \nlow. Screening can be applied to assemblies, e.g., by subjecting them to combined \ntempe~ and vibmtion environments and is thus more versatile than demting. \nScreening at the assembly level is also likely to result in a lower mtio of test cost to \nproduct cost and thus produces a higher figure of merit. \n\n\n\n776 Space Manufacturing and Reliability \n\nPart Strength \n(Any DesIrable Attribute) \n\nFig. 19-12.

In most cases it also requires much more resources. A summary of the suitability \nand limitations of representative fault tolerance techniques is shown in Table 19-8. \n\nTABLE 19-8.

Paralleling two relay contacts is a redundancy provision of very small \nscope, and dual telemetry systems represent redundancy of large scope. In Fig. 19-14 \nthe single system line shows the reliability of a single element with MTBF of one time \nunit. The system redundancy curve shows the resulting reliability if two of these ele-\nments are operated in paralleL The partitioned redundancy curve refers to the original \n(single) system being divided into quarters, and then each quarter made redundant. \nThe redundant and the quarter-partitioned curve involve (at least superficially) the \nsame resources (in each case twice those of the single system), and yet the quarter \nconfiguration has a pronounced reliability advantage, particularly at the longer time \nintervals. It would therefore seem that redundancy of small scope is to be preferred \nover that of large scope. \n\nIn practice, the switching or voting provisions that are required for each partition \ncan add considerably to the cost of the implementation, and since they are not likely \nto be 100% reliable they may also reduce the reliability benefits. System test can also \nbe adversely impacted by redundancy of small scope. The system redundancy (middle \ncurve in the figure) requires only two tests. The quarter redundancy requires 16 tests \nif all combinations are to be covered. Selecting the scope of redundancy must consider \nthe meaDs of failure detection, the ease of output switching or combining, the reliabil-\nity gains that can be achieved, and the cost of implementation and test. \n\nSame Design Redundtuu:y \nSame design redundancy involves installation of two or more identical components \n\ntogether with switching to make one of them active. In a few instances, particularly for \npower supplies, the outputs can be combined so that switching is not necessary. Voting \ncan also be used for combining outputs of redundant units but this carries a high cost \nbecause at least three identical units have to be installed to make it practicable. Same \ndesign redundancy offers very high protection against random failures, and the \n\n\n\nI \n\n! i \n\n778 \n\nRg.19-14. \n\nSpace Manufacturing and ReBability \n\n0.8 r-'1i:--t-.........:~-+--;~~--+---I \n\n0.6 \n\n~ \n:B \n=i a: \n\nD.4 \n\n0.2 \n\n~,~~~~~ __ L-~~ __ ~~ \n0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 \n\nTime (MuIUples of MTBF) \n\nEffect o!

This form of redun-\n\nReliability for Space Mission Planning 771) \n\ndancy is economical primarily where the back-up unit comes from a previous satellite \ndesign, or where there is experience with it from another source. Where there is con-\ncern about the design integrity of a primary component. diverse design redundancy \nmay have to be employed regardless of cost. \n\nFunctional and Temporal Redundancy \nFunctional redundancy (sometimes called analytic redundancy) involves furnish-\n\ning a service by diverse means. An example is the determination of attitude rate from \na rate gyro assembly (direct), and from observation of celestial bodies (indirect). It is \nparticularly advantageous when the alternate is already installed for another service, \ne.g., if a star sensor is provided for navigation. In these cases the only cost incurred is \nfor the switching provisions and for data conversion. Both of these can frequently be \nachieved in an existing onboard computer, thus further minimizing the cost. \n\nFunctional redundancy can also take the form of a ground back-up for functions \npreferably performed autonomously, e.g., navigation, thermal control, or furnishing \ncommands for sensor operation. In the communication subsystem there are frequently \nomni-directional and directional antenna systems. For some satellite missions these \nmay also be considered a form of functional redundancy. \n\nThe chief benefits of analytic redundancy are: (1) it avoids the cost and weight \npenalties of physical redundancy, and (2) it is inherently diverse, thus providing \nprotection against design faults. The major limitation is that the back-up provisions \nusually entail lower performance. \n\nTemporal redundancy involves repetition of an unsuccessful operation. A common \nexample is a retry after a failure within the computing process. The same technique is \napplicable to acquisition of a star, firing of a pyrotechnic device, or communication \nwith the ground. This is obviously a low cost technique. It is most effective when the \ndesign incorporates an analysis of the optimum retry interval and of changes that may \nimprove the success oflater operations, e.g., switching a power supply, reducing loads \non the power supply, or re-orientation of the satellite. The most important step is to \nplan ahead for retry of operations and to incorporate \"hooks\" that pennit automatic or \nground-initiated retry. \n\n11).2.4 Test Techniques \nThe least expensive reliability testis one that is not run at all as a reliability test. but \n\nrather as a part of a qualification test. lot acceptance test for purchased parts, or as an \nacceptance test on the spacecraft as a whole or on a major subsystem. To use these . \nactivities for reliability assessment may require some additional instrumentation and \nsometimes an extension of the test time, but these are very small resource expenditw'es \ncompared to those required for even a modest separately run reliability test. \n\nOther alternatives to obtaining reliability data by test are: \n\n\u2022 Using test data obtained by others (including vendors) on the same component \n\n\u2022 Using test or experience data on similar components \n\n\u2022 Stress-strength analysis (particularly for mechanical components) \n\n\u2022 Reliability prediction by MU..-HDBK-217 or similar sources \n\nOne of the greatest problems with reliability tests is that the results are usually \nobtained after many months or even years of test. Once it has been decided that a \nreliability test is necessary, a suitable scope and test environment must be selected. \n\nr I \nI \n\n\n\nI'\" ! \nI \nI \n~ \n\n-, \n\nI. \n\n780 Space Manufacturing and ReHability 19.2 \n\nThe scope designates the assembly level; parts and circuit boards usuaIl bein d . \n~~an~gsesmallOfscopeall' while subsystem and system level tests represent ~ larg; sc esopelg_ \n\nsm scope tests are: -' \n\n\u00b7 !:~ cost and small size of individual test articles permit testing of multiple \n\u2022 Inputs and outputs are easily accessible \n: The test environment can be tailored to the requirements of the unit under test \n\nThe test can be conducted early because it does not require integration. \n\nAdvantages oflarge scope tests are: \n\u2022 Interactions between components can be observed \n\u2022 Test results are easily translated to effects on the mission. \n\nThe test environment can be' ( . testing in a qw'escent . qUiescent room ambIent) or stressed.

Yet, experimental verification of the claimed reliability of a \ncomponent or subsystem is frequently desirable and sometimes fequired. The follow-\ning paragraphs explore low cost methods of accomplishing this. \n\nThe major causes of failures are workmanship and design. The first of these can be \ncontrolled by quality assurance. Design failures occur primarily because the strength \nof a component is not adequate for the environment in which it is used, or because the \nmanufacturing process permits too much variability in component characteristics. This \nis most easily seen in mechanical spacecraft components where reliability depends on \n(a) the margin between the nominal (mean) strength of the component and the \nmaximum service load and (b) the variability of strength about the mean in the \ndelivered product. Since test can characterize the strength of mechanical components \nfairly easily, strength-load margins (design margins) have always played a major role \nin their reliability assessment. For electrical and electronic components the same rela-\ntionship holds in principle, but it is usually much harder to define a single failure \ninducing stress or load. Nevertheless, test data can give valuable insights into potential \nreliability problems. Important requirements are (a) recording of test results in numer-\nical form (not passlfail), and (b) statistical evaluation of the probability of failure \nderived from the numerical test results, e.g. by applying the 60\" criterion (the mean \nvalue of a parameter is at least six standard deviations above the specified minimum \nor below the specified maximum) [Harry, 1997]. The tests from which the required \ndata are obtained need not be specific reliability tests. Typically they are the qualifica-\ntion test and acceptance tests. \n\nReferences \nChan, H.

We can no longer just apply a general-purpose cost model to \ndecide which programs to fund. Instead, we must develop a deeper understanding of \ncost-modeling methods, programmatic factors, and technological risks. As fiscal pres_ \nsures continue to drive space budgets lower, cost estimates are being used at virtuaIIy \nall stages of space system procurement. Early in conceptual design, cost estimates help \nus assess whether development will succeed and identify key design decisions that will \ninfluence future costs. Project costs are monitored throughout the development cycle, \nand if they move much above budgeted amounts, we often must rescope or even cancel \nthe program. Cost models must be flexible enough to evolve, from preliminary design \nto much later in the integration and test process, when we're deciding how to reallocate \nlimited or diminishing resources. \n\nIn this chapter, we will \n\u2022 Describe how to obtain cost estimates for space system elements \n\u2022 Provide cost-estimating relationships useful for advanced system planning \n\u2022 Describe how to assess the uncertainty (risk) in the cost estimates \n\u2022 Show how cost and design may be integrated. \n\n20.1 Introduction to Cost Analysis \n\n20.1.1 Elements of Analysis \n\nFigure 20-1 shows the relationships among key elements of cost analysis. The first \nstep is to develop preliminary cost analysis requirements descriptions which identify \nthe technical and operational parameters (cost drivers). These become ''inputs'' to cost \nmodels. We will develop just such a description in this chapter for FireSat. Each alter-\nnative concept specifies the configuration, number of units, orbits, equipment lists, \nhardware and software, and operational staffing needed for costing the system. The \nnext step in the process is definition of a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), an orga-\nnizational table used to categorize and normalize costs. The WBS should cover all \nphases of the program. For example, the operations period follows Initial Operating \nCapability (ICC) and includes software maintenance costs and spare satellites. \n\nGround rules and assumptions should be laid out at the outset. These assumptions \nestablish the foundation for understanding the costs and comparing them with those of \nother programs. Example assumptions include: \n\n\u2022 Costs listed in constant-year dollars (fiscal funding information records costs \nin then-year dollars) \n\n\u2022 Inflation rate forecasts (see Sec. 20.1.4) \n\n\u2022 Exclusion of contractor fee and costs of the government project office \n\n\u2022 Inclusion of government-furnished equipment \n\n\u2022 Learning curve percentage (See Sec. 20.4.4) \n\nOnce input parameters have been specified and assumptions delineated, cost \nmodels support the preparation of estimates for each design alternative. The models \ncombine cost data and cost-estimating relationships as described in Sec. 203. The cost \nestimates are organized by each segment's work breakdown structure, Iife-cycle \nphase, and schedule. Estimates prepared with cost models are not \"end products\" \n\nInput Parameters \n\n~-lrmIJ \nBasBIIn& Concept'A' \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Concept\"N\" \n\nAssumptions \n\n__ and \n\nAssUmJIIlOI18 \n\u2022 Base Year DoIJaJ8 .--\u2022 Exd1Ides Fees \n._LJle.Yeara \n.~ \n\n\u2022 QovemmenI.f'IImIs/I8d \n\n.~1nfra$UCIWD \n\u2022 Tednology LewI \n.t..eamIngRala \n\nTotal UJ&.CycIe CosIAcIIYIly PhaSe \n\nI c \nI B \n\nA \n\n5enoItivIIy AnalySIs \n\n-\n\n. -:---\":'~::;RDT=&E'-. \nICC \n\nTIme(Yeam) \n\nOutputS \n\nIOC+ 10 \n\nIOC m InI!IaI 0peraIlng CapadIy \n\nFIg. 21).1.

The Work Breakdown Structure \nIs an Important tool for organizing cost Information and enSuring consistency In com-\nparing alternatives. \n\nLife-Cycle Costs of a space mission architecture (i.e., the total mission cost from \nplanning through end-of-life) are broken down into three main phases. The Research, \nDevelopment, Test, and Evaluation (ROT &E) phase includes design, analysis, and test \nof breadboards, brassboards, prototypes and qualification units. Commonly referred to \nas the nonrecurring phase, RDT &E conventionally includes protoflight units and one-\ntime ground station costs. This phase does not include technology development for \nsy~tem compone~ts. The ProtIuctio.n. phase incorporates the cost of producing flight \numts and launching them. A definition used to model costs is the Theoretical First \nUnit ~, ~hich represe~ts the ~t fli~t-qualified satellite off the line (for single-\nsatellIte IDlSSIOns the TFU IS the flight article). For multiple units, production cost is \nestimated using a learning curve factor applied to the TFU cost as discussed in \nSec. 2~.4.4. Re~l.acement satellites and launches after the space system final \noperattng capabIlity (FOC = full complement of on-orbit satellites) has been estab-\nlished are not considered as production units. The Operations and Maintenance \n(O&M) phase consists of ongoing operations and maintenance costs, including space-\ncraft unIt replacements and software maintenance. Although the space, launch, and \nground segments are usually the most importapt elements, O&M can sometimes be the \nsystem's most costly on~ (especially. for constellations and reusable systems). For \nmost space programs the primary ongoing operations and support costs are ground \nstation operations and satellite spares; for reusable systems such as the Shuttle this \ncategory consists of the ground crew and operations to support them. ' \n\n20.1 Introduction to Cost Analysis 787 \n\n20.1.2 Cost Estimating Methods \n\nThe work breakdown structure and system concept provide guidance for determin-\ning which cost methods apply. Three basic methods are used to develop cost estimates: \n\n1. In detailed bottom-up estimating we identify and specify at a 10:-\" level elements \nthat make up the system. We then estimate the cost of matenaIs and labor to \ndevelop and produce each element. This method has the, ad~tage o~ ~~g \nexplicitly tailored to a specific program and contractor, but Its basIS of validity IS \nthe credibility of the experts called upon to estimate inputs, such as hours, labor \nrates material costs, and indirect costs. Because this method is time consuming \nand because detailed design data is usually not available, this method is least \nappropriate for preliminary syste~ studies. Bottom-up estimates. are m~t \ncommonly used during the production phase of a program, after desIgn details \nare well known and a majority of technical uncertainties have been resolved \nduring development. \n\n2. In analogy-based estimating we use the cost of a s~ar item and adjust it for \ndifferences in size or complexity. We can apply this method at any level of \ndetail in the system, but it is lower fidelity than a bottom-up estimate. This \nmethod also presumes that a sufficiently similar item exists and that we have \ndetailed cost and technical data on which to base our estimate. \n\n3. In parametric estimating we use a series of mathematical relationships that \nrelate cost to physical, technical, and performance parameters that are known \nto strongly influence costs. An equation called the Cost Estimating Relation-\nship or CER, expresses the cost as a function of parameters. Cost drivers and \nfundtion forms are selected based on a combination of engineering judgment \nand the statistical quality of the regression results. We may also apply complex-\nity factors to the parameters to account for technology changes. \n\nAll three methods have advantages and disadvantages, depending on scope of the \nestimating effort and the amount of design and performance information (e.g~ relevant \nhistorical data for analogy) available to estimators. Until recently, parametric models \nwere avoided as the primary tool for developing a proposal bid and used only as back-\nup to validate another estimate. That situation is beginning to change, mainly due to \nthe progress of the Parametrics Estimating Initiative led by several cost-estimating \nprofessional societies and endorsed by the DoD: \n\nThe primary advantage of parametric models lies in their top-down approach. \nSystem requirements and top-level design. specifications ~ all that are ~uired to \ncomplete a cost estimate with a parametrIc model. DetaIled hardware desIgns and \ndevelopment schedules do not have to be .~ed to estimate ~osts of can~datt: system \narchitectures. Incorporation of CERs WIthin a system deslgn!cost-engmeenng tool \nallows concept evaluation and technol?gy studies to be conducted. ~arametri~ cost \nmodels are therefore well suited for use 1D cost/performance trade studies that estimate \nhow cost varies as a function of system requirements, in developmental planning and \narchitecture studies, and in specific program assessments of cost vs. capability and \n\n\u2022 Due to recent downsizing of estimating staffs in government ~d industry and gen~ ~\u00ad\ning of the parametric estimating process, the DoD has publicly adv~ application of \nparametric estirilating models as the preferred method of proposal estunattng. See the DoD \n[1998) for guidance and examples. \n\n\n\nf\nlf \n\nI' \n\nI I \nII \n\n!, \n\n788 Cost Modeling 20.1 \n\nindividual parameter sensitivity. Since parameteric cost models are the most appropri_ \nate for trade studies, they are the focus of the remainder of this chapter. \n\nUse of a parametric model implies several assumptions. FIrSt, because parametric \nmodels characterize historical cost trends as mathematical relationships, it is assumed \nthat future costs will reflect these historical trends to some degree. Parametric models \nare applicable only to the range of historical data. In cases when major technology \nadvancements are expected, or when fundamental paradigms in system architecture \nare shifted, parametric cost models based on old systems may very well not apply. One \nexample of this problem is enCountered when large-satellite-based cost models are \nused to estimate costs oftoday's smallsats. Such a paradigm shift, and perhaps a tech-\nnology shift, requires a specialized model. Lacking new technology factors, CERs \nmUst be adjusted when applied to systems using beyond state-of-the-art technology. \nWe derive the CERs from historical data, so their technologies may not reflect the \nadvances usually considered in futuristic studies. \n\nA second implicit assumption made when using parametric cost models is that \nprogram costs are random variables that cannot be predicted with 100% accuracy. \nMany more parameters influence costs than can be incorporated into a set of CERs, \nsuch as skill level of contractor engineers and technicians, occurrence of unforeseen \ntechnical problems, business base of all contractors involved, requirements changes, \nand test failures. Parametric cost models use a combination of parameters that explain \nhistorical cost trends while maintaining statistical integrity. Influence of all other vari-\nables manifests itself in estimating error, which is often quantified by using underlying \ndata to calculate the standard error, SE. \n\nThere are three general sources for parametric cost estimating models: \n\n\u2022 Publicly available special purpose models, such as the Unmanned Space \nVehicle Cost Model (USCM), the Small Satellite Cost Model (SSCM), and the \nCommunications Payload and Spacebome Electronics Cost Model (CPCM). \nSuch models are typically developed by the Federal Government and are \nusually available to the general public\u00b7. See the references at the end of this \nchapter for source information. \n\n\u2022 Publicly available general purpose models, offered privately by commercial \norganizations such as PRICE Systems and SEER Systems. These general \npurpose models typically must be calibrated to the user's specific products and \nprocesses before they can be used for estimating space hardware and software \ncomponents. \n\n\u2022 Private specific purpose models, usually developed by a single organization \nfrom proprietary information, to estimate company-specific systems and com-\nponents only. ' \n\nIn Sec. 20.3 we present CERs for computing the cost of space systems based on \npublicly available models. If these models do not apply to a specific concept, we may \nneed to derive new relationships. The following section summarizes this process. \nFisher [1970) provides a comprehensive discussion. \n\n\u2022 Although we refer primarily to government programs and data, the models may be applied to \ncommercial programs. The recommended cost models are appropriate for both large and small \nmissions. (See Sec. 20.3.) \n\n20.1 \nIntroduction to Cost Analysis 789 \n\n201.3 Cost Model Development \n'F gure 20-3 shows the procedure for developing a CER that represents how the cost \n\n1 roes of a system or subsystem vary with characteristic ~ters. The first \npro~ t in defining a set of CERs is a historical database. ExtensIve research and \n:: co~ection based on actual cost and technical data is needed. It's important to ~d \n\nut as much as possible about the origin of the data and the reference for meas~g \no baraCteristic physical parameters. We must also separate the cost elements mto \n~~ arable physical subsystems or components, which become the costing elem~ts \nwe !e to establish the entire system cost. Programs either already completed or a-:Vlll\u2022t-\n. launch within a year should be targeted as opposed to programs that are still m :IY stages of development. Most costs in the database should be actual program costs \n\nleti'on In cases where satellites are nearly complete but have not yet been at comp . . used \nlaunched, contractor estimates-at-completlon costs may be . \n\nI SubsyStem N \nr subsystem B \n\nSubsyStem A \n\nTiiiT ~ \nConstant Year Costs \n\nDevelop \nDatabase \n\nI SubsVstem N \nIdentify r Subsystem B \n\nCorrelation \n\n[\u00a7) \n1 SubsystemA \n\n......

CER and StatIstIcs \n\nFig. 20-3. Deriving CERs from Actuals. The key to a credible CER Is an accurate database of \nrelevant historical information from actual programs. \n\nIt is also important to normalize the hist~rical data so i.t is consistenl-Correctly \ncategorized between nonrecurring and recurnng ~os~ and 1D th~ same co~tant-ye~ \ndollars. Then, we would compensate for econolDlC differences 1D production quan~\u00ad\nties. The design or performance parameters to which costs will be related must be 1D \nthe same units. These include programmatic, weight-based, and perfo~ce parame-\nters for the satellite in general and each of the m~jor s~bs~stems. We typically excl~de \nthe prime contractor's fee but include all other direct, m~t, and general and admin-\nistrative costs. Award fees and incentives are usually not mcluded, nor ~ gov~e~t \ncosts (Le., costs associated with the government procurement agency if one eXIsts). \n\nAfter cost data are properly categorized and normalized. ~e task of ~ ru:ve~op\u00ad\nment begins. To allow credible subsystem-level cost analySIS of potentiallDl~I?ns \nwithout requiring a detailed design we need to relate cost ~ techni~ charactenstics. \nOther factors, named wraps, model nonphysical factors not mcluded m the CER, s~ch \nas system engineering management, and product assurance, as well as the cost of m-\ntegrating and testing the space system. Wraps typically account for about 3~% ?f the \ndevelopment cost for space systems. Choosing cost drivers involves a combmation of \n\n\u2022 A fee should ~ added if we want to detennine the purchase Jl!ice. This fee is normally ~ \nnegotiated value, but 10% is typical for a cost analySIs. In addi!i0n, be aware of the need \nincIu~e subcontractor fees according to the planned contractor tier ammgements. \n\n\n\n790 Cost Modeling \n20.1 \n\nstatistics, engineering judgment, and often, common sense. We would hypothesize a \nrelationship between costs and the explanatory parameters. For conceptual stud-\nies-the primary focus of this book-we would limit the parameters to one or two per \nsubsystem. \n\nFor space systems, cost drivers would be primarily weight, power, and performance \nrequirements, the parameters most likely to be available during an advanced system \nstudy. For example, in the derivation of the CER for the electrical power subsystem, \nwe might consider the following: mass, beginning-of-life power, solar array area, on-\norbit average power, design life, battery capacity, solar cell type, battery type, and \npayload power. As another example, if the attitude control subsystem is of interest, we \nwould examine parameters such as pointing accuracy, knowledge, and required slew \nrate. We prefer to use a power law for relationships (see Fig. 20-3) because it allows \nfor expected nonlinearities, and can be easily accommodated by standard regression \npackages. Also, since weight is often a key parameter for cost-estimating relation-\nships, the power function with an exponent of less than one models the expected \ndiminishing effects of increasing weight on costs. This highlights a danger not to \nforget: that all CERs are simplifications of the relationship they are emulating. \nWeight-driven CERs, for example, imply that lighter structures cost less. In fact, the \nopposite may be true. We need to recognize that when designers deliberately reduce \nweight, they may increase complexity, trade away ease of manufacturing an integra_ \ntion, or use inherently more expensive materials. \n\nWhen deriving CERs we take note of statistical outliers and follow up to ascertain \nwhether or not apparent discrepancies are attributable to numerical errors or nontradi-\ntional ways of accounting for certain costs. We evaluate the \"goodness\" of the \nrelationship by evaluating the costs against their corresponding parameters USing \nregression software. For further information on statistics and regression techniques, \nsee, for example, Book and Young [1995J. The regression results in an equation be-\ntween cost and the parameter or parameters, as well as statistics that indicate how well \nthe relationship fits the data. Measures of the goodness of fit include the coefficient of \ndetermination, R2, and the standard e\"or, SE. R2, is dimensionless between 0 and l. \nSE is in units of cost or a percentage of the estimated cost depending on whether an \nadditive or multiplicative error regression approach is used. A strong correlation is \nrepresented by R2 near 1 and SE near O. SE is important in evaluating the uncertainty \nin estimates as discussed in Sec. 20.4. \n\nFor additional information on space cost model development and space costing, \nsee, for example, Apgar [1990J, DISA [1997J, Greenberg and Hertzfeld [1994J, and \nHamaker [1989J. For a discussion of cost modeling for low-cost missions see Wertz \nand Larson [1996J and Sarsfield [1998]. \n\n20.1.4 Types of Dollars \n\nFor consistency in referring to costs and to avoid confusion in the review of cost \nanalysis results, constant-year dollars should be used. For examples in this chapter, \nFiscal Year 2000 dollars (FYOO$) are assumed. This simplifies the computations and \ninterpretation of results, especially in making comparisons of alternatives. If project \nfunding by year is required, then the costs should be spread first by year in constant \ndollars and converted to real or then-year dollars by mUltiplying each year's funding \nby an appropriate inflation factor. Table 20-1 provides a table of inflation factors for \n1980-2020 relative to FY2000 as provided by the Office of the Secretary of Defense. \n\n20.2 The Parametric Cost Estimation Process 791 \n\nInflation Factors Relative to the Year 2000 Based on ProJections by the \nTABLE 20-1.

Primary cost driver is \nmass. \n\n\u2022 Structure: spacecraft structure items including enclosures, deployable compo-\nnents, supporting structure and launch vehicle interface. The spacecraft \nstructure carries and protects the spacecraft and payload equipment through \nlaunch and deployment Mass is the key metric that determines cost. \n\n\u2022 Thermal: structure and devices for the purpose of maintaining all elements of \na satellite system within required temperature limits. Thermal control systems \nmay be classified as passive or active. An example of a passive system is \npaints, coatings and blankets, and a space radiator coupled to heat sources by \nconductive paths such as base plates. Active thermal-control subsystems \ninclude pumped-loop systems, heaters controlled by thermostats, mechanical \ndevices (e.g. louvers) and refrigerators. In generaI,passive systems cost less \nthan active systems. \n\n\u2022 Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS): solar arrays, batteries, harness, and power \nmanagement electronics. EPS mass, used in the cost model, is largely \ninfluenced by space radiation, which degrades performance of solar cells over \ntime (FrreSat has a 5-year design life). Choices for off-the-shelf solar-array \ncells include silicon or gaIIium arsenide.

Primary cost driv~ \nof the IT &C/DH subsystem are subsystem mass, frequency of the UPlink and \ndownlink, and data rate. In some cases, this is further divided into IT &C (the \ncommunications system) and C&DH (the spacecraft computer plus other data \nstorage and hand1ing equipment). \n\n\u2022 Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem (ADCS): stabilizes and orients \nFrreSat during its mission using sensors and actuators. ADCS is tightly \ncoupled to other subsystems, especially the propulsion subsystem. The prima. \nry drivers are requirements for pointing knowledge, control stability, and \nmaneuvering (such as slewing or payload repointing). The FrreSat mission \nrequires a 3-axis control system to point in a specific direction to within 0.25 \ndeg; knowledge of spacecraft attitude is 0.10 deg. \n\n\u2022 Propulsion: Provides thrust for attitude control and orbit correction. FIreSat \nuses a liquid system for on-orbit attitude correction and maneuvering (Table \n7-3). The relevant cost drivers are the propulsion subsystem bus dry mass of \n8.4 kg (Table 10-31) and the spacecraft dry mass of 112 kg (Sec. 10.6). If orbit \ninsertion requires an apogee kick motor, additional costs should be assessed. \n\n\u2022 Integration, Assembly, and Test (1A&T): labor and material costs (Primarily \ntesting) for integrating spacecraft and payload subsystems into an operational \nspace vehicle. Does not include costs for integrating components into a \nsubsystem (these costs are included in the subsystem CERs) or for integrating \nthe space vehicle with the launch vehicle. The total cost of IA&T for a satellite \nincludes researchlrequirements specification, design and scheduling analysis \nof IA&T procedures, systems test and evaluation, and test data analysis. \n\n\u2022 Program Level: contractor costs for systems engineering, program manage. \nment. reliability, planning, requirements tlowdown, quality assurance, project \ncontrol, data preparation, and other costs which cannot be assigned to individ-\nual hardware or software components. Program management includes efforts \nassociated with planning and directing prime and subcontractor efforts and \ninteractions. System engineering includes activities required to ensure that all \nsatellite subsystems and payloads function properly to achieve system goals \nand requirements. Data and report generation is a program-level function that \nincludes efforts required to produce internal and deliverable documentation. \n\n\u2022 Ground Support Equipment (GSE): test and support equipment needed for \nassembly, development and acceptance testing and iDtegration of satellite \nsubsystems and satellite to the launch vehicle. This equipment is required to \nsupport the satellite and provide physical, electrical, and data interfaces with \nthe satellite during IA&T. It is therefore classified as a nonrecuning cost. \n\n\u2022 Launch and Orbital Operations Support (LOOS): planning and operations \nrelated to launch and orbital checkout of the space system. These costs are \nthose costs typically incurred by the spacecraft prime contractor involving \nprelaunch planning, trajectory analysis, launch site support, launch-vehicle \nintegration (spacecraft portion), and initial on-orbit operations before owner-\nship of the satellite is turned over to the operational user (typically 30 days). \nThey are generally categorized as recurring costs. \n\nZO.3 Cost Estimating Relationships 795 \n\n20.3 Cost Estimating Relationsbips \nThis section presents the specific CERs recommended for preliminary mission \n\nanalysis and design. \n\n20.31 Space Segment Costs . \nThe CERs of Tables 20-4, 20-5, and 20-6 may be used to estim~te costs m thou-\n\nsands of fISCal year 2000 constant dollars as a function of the ~fied p~e~. \nSec 20 1 4 for conversion to other years.)

The models cover \nboth the subsystem and system levels with the user choosing the appropriate level. The \nmodels used here are publicly-available. special-purpose models, developed by the \nU.S. Air Force and NASA. These CERs were obtained from the Unmanned Space \nVehicle Cost Model, Seventh Edition [SMC. 1994], the Communications Payload and \nSpaceborne Electronics Cost Model [MCR Federal, 1997], and a derivative of the \nSmall Satellite Cost Model [Bearden et al., 1996]. Other models that could be used in \nlieu of those given in the tables are given by Burgess, Lao, and Bearden [1995], and \nManagement Consulting and Research, Inc. [1986]. \n\nThe primary categories of costs are hardware, software and program level (or wrap-\narounds) used to indicate that the estimates for these functions are based upon percent-\nages of hardware cost. Wraps are costs associated with labor-intensive activities where \na level of manpower is allocated over some period of performance. The functions in \nthis category are management, systems engineering, product assurance, and system \ntests. The CERs of Tables 20-4, 20-5, and 20-6 provide the overall program level costs \nand Table 20-7 provides an allocation of program level costs to the wrap components. \n\n7fJ7 \n20.3 \n\nCost Estimating Re1ationships . \n\nCost-EstImating ReJationshlps for Earth-orbltlng Small Satellites including \nTABLE 20-6.

This includes all costs associated with design verification and \ninterface requirements (e.g. drawings, schematics, mocIrups, boilerplates. breadboards \nand brassboards). Recurring costs cover all eff0!t8 associated with flight hardware \nmanufacture, IA&T, and a portion of program management and system engineering \ncosts. The CERs in Tables 20-4 and 20-5 are aIready separated between RDT &E (non-\nrecurring) and TFU (recurring) costs. Since the CERs in Table 20-6 provide estimates \nof total subsystem cost, factors for the split between RDT &E and TFU are needed. To \nmeet this need, we present a list of recurring and nOnrecurring factors in Table 20-9. \nThese factors can be applied to estimated total subsystem costs from CERs to obtain \nestimates of the recurring and nonrecurring portions. Total production costs for all \nflight units are computed by multiplying the TFU cost by the learning curve factor L \ndescribed in Sec. 20.4.4. \n\nPrototype vs. ProtoOight Approach \n\nA proto flight approach is one in which the quaIification test unit is refurbished for \nflight The CERs in Table 20-4 assume a prototype approach, Le., include the cost of \none quaIification unit The small-satellite CERs in Table 20-6 assume a protoflight \napproach. The protoflight approach saves on costs since no \"dead end\" hardware will \nresult For refurbishment of the qualification unit to become the protoflight unit, 30% \nof the TFU should be added to the RDT &E cost The RDT &E estimate will then \ninclude the first flight article. \n\nHeritage Factors \n\nTable 20-8 presents factors for development heritage. These are multiplicative fac-\ntors to be applied to the RDT&E CER for design maturity of a given subsystem. The \ndifficulty in incorporating heritage information in cost estimation has been, and con-\ntinues to be, the quantification of heritage; part of this problem stems from a lack of a \n\nTABLE 20-9. \n\nCost Estimating Relationships 799 \n\nBreakdown of SmaU SateUIte Costs.

We define heritage as the percentage of a subsystem \nthat is identical to one or more previous spacecmft, by mass. This ha;s the appeal .of \nbeing a measurable quantity, but has some obvious drawbacks. For Instance, while \nmass may be a reasonable measure of design heritage for structures, it may not be \nappropriate for the TT&C subsystem. With this in mind. heritage is ~ value, from 0% \n(no heritage) to 100% (all heritage), which varies by subsystem and IS best eval~~ \nby subsystem design experts. For example, if the ~ubs~ste~ represe\u00bb;ts an. ex~ting \ndesign with 70% heritage, the developments costs will pnmanly be en~neenng inter-\nface and drawing modifications so that only 30% of the RDT&E cost IS needed. \n\nCommercial Missions \nThe CERs presented here were derived primarily from government procurements. \n\nWe should apply a RDT &E factor of 0.8 when the CERs are used t? estimate comm~\u00ad\ncial satellite costs. This is an average factor based upon companson of COlDDlerCIal \ncommunication satellites with government-procured communication satellites. Smith. \nStucker and Simmons [1985] have perfonned a comprehensive study that indicates a \n19% cost growth for military satellite contracts com~ to ~% f?J ~omm~ial. The \nrationale for the difference is the higher level of uncertainty In IDISSIOD ~wrem~nts \nas more changes typically occur on the military programs. However, their findings \nindicate little difference in unit recurring costs. \n\n\n\n11' 1'1 \n\n800 Cost Modeling \n20.3 20.3 Cost Estimating Relationships \n\n881 \n\n20.3.2 Software Costs \n\nTable 20-10 presents software costing relationships for flight and ground software. \nIt also provides factors for various programming languages. Section 1633 discUSSes \nsoftware development costs further. Flight software is assumed to cost more (per \nKLOC) because there is more testing required to meet mission criticality. If software \nreuse is employed, the heritage factors in Table 20-8 apply. \n\nTABLE 20-10. Software Development Costs. RDT&E costs only (in FYoo$K).

For most ground station cost estimates, we must state requirements \nfor square footage of facilities, and an equipment list of specific items (computers, RF \nequipment, and so forth) which are typically not determined during the concept devel-\nopment stage of a program. \n\nFor this model, the costs for various elements of a ground station will be based \nupon typical distribution of costs between software, equipment, facilities and wraps, \nas Table 20-11 indicates. The distribution is fairly representative of a number of \nspace projects. For preliminary mission design, this may be translated into estimated \ncosts as follows. First, compute the software costs from Table 20-10. Then estimate \nother ground segment costs as a percent of software costs using the representative \ndistributions of Table 20-11. A column to simplify this calculation has been added \nto the table. \n\nThe operations and support costs during the operational phase of the ground \nsegment consist primarily of contractor and government personnel costs as well as \nmaintenance costs of the equipment, software, and facilities. Table 20-12 presents \nexpressions for these costs. The labor rates include overhead costs and other typical \nexpenses associated with personnel. For smaller Earth terminals, Table 20-13 provides \nsome typical costs of communications equipment for commonly used frequency \nbands. \n\nGround Segment Development CoSt Model.

Cost \nestimates derived from the CERs should therefore be accompanied by a cost-risk \nassessment to estimate potential effects of a level of complexity below or beyond \naverage. \n\nCost-Risk Analysis provides an assessment of the ability of projected funding \nprofile to assure that a program can be completed and meet its stated objectives. \nAlthough technical risks are often one of the biggest cost drivers for space systems, \nmany cost-engineering processes and models ignore effects of cost risk in the interest \nof quick-turnaround estimates. Cost-risk analysis is important because single-point \ncost estimates, while meeting the top-level needs of budgetary planners, often do not \nmeet the needs of those who want to perform more detailed trade-offs between cost \nand performance (see Book [1993}). The purpose of cost-risk analysis is threefold: \n\n1. Translate qualitative risk assessments into quantitative cost impacts \n\n2. Assist program managers in managing risk \n\n3. Establish an empirical basis for estimating future programs with confidence \n\nThis section describes a method of assessing the uncertainty in cost estimates. This \nincludes identifying the sources of uncertainty, combining them to arrive at a program \nlevel cost uncertainty, and interpreting the results. Cost-risk analysis view!! each cost \nelement as an uncertain quantity that has a probability distribution and attempts to \nevaluate technical, programmatic, and schedule risks in quantitative terms. Qualitative \nmeasures of risks are then translated into cost-estimate adjustments. A key to making \nquick, consistent, and defensible assessments is reducing SUbjectivity by making \nassumptions about sources and magnitude of cost risk. The major sources of cost \nuncertainty we consider here are: \n\n\u2022 Cost-estimating uncertainty as quantified by the standard error, SE \n\n\u2022 Cost growth due to unforeseen technical difficulties \n\nExamples of risk drivers include beyond state-of-the-art technology (e.g. cooling, \nprocessing, survivability, power,laser communications), unusual production require-\n\n\n\n804 Cost ModeJing 20.4 \n\nments (e.g. lm:ge quantities. toxic ma~al~) \u2022. ~ght sched~es (e.g. undeveloped \ntechnology. software development. supplier VIability). system mtegration (e.g. multi-\ncontractor teams, system testing), and unforeseen events (e.g. launch slip need ftor \n~~ , \n\nThe objective is to quantify the sum of the contribution of these uncertainties to the \nover:aD system or program costs. We will use the nwst likely estimates (MLE), the sum \n?btained from the cost models and derive probability distributions that contain the \nunpact of technology uncertainty and the uncertainty of the cost estimates. Cost-\nestimating uncertainty is quantified by computing the standard error (SE). For \ndevelopment of space-system hardware, CERs usually have SE between 30% and \n50%. Cost-estimating uncertainty is therefore quantified by a distribution that has a \nmean (the estimate, C), and a variance (square of the SE). '\" \n\nCost risk due to technical difficulties is estimated using the technology readiness \nlevel (TRL), shown in Table 20-15, a NASA classification scheme for the level of \nJechnology development (the inherent development risk). A TRL of 1 or 2 represents \na situation of relatively high risk. TRLs of 3, 4 and 5 represent moderate risks and 6 \nthrou~ 8.are low-risk categories. Based upon related experience, the sugges~ cost \nuncertainties are also presented in Table 20-15. Thus, a low developmental risk sub-\nsystem would have a one standard deviation uncertainty of less than 10% about the \nmost likely estimate.. ' \n\nTABLE 20-15.

Cost models use the terms most likely estimate, \nMLE, and sto;uJord error, SE, because the statistical data in the CERs is not truly Gaussian. \nHowever, usmg a Gaussian probability distribution is often convenient for analyzing errors. \nConsequently, t?mughout this section ,,:,e will use MLE from the CERs interchangeably with \nthe mean or estimated cost, C, and SE mterchangeably with the standard deviation c:r even \n~u~ ~eans and standard deviations are applicable only if the statistical data has a Ga~sian \ndistribution. \n\n20.4 \nOther TopiCS 805 \n\nOther adjustment factors correct for uncertainty in the deve~opment status of a \ns ific technology.

Since the technology uncertam\n\nbe \nty s:~ :e c~st \n\ntimating uncertainties are independent (uncorrelated), these may com m usmg \n: tandard square root of the sum of the squares. (See standard probability texts.) For \ne:a:nple, suppose a subsystem TFU ~is $5 million. ~e ~k level is modera~ with \na 20% standard deviation in uncertainty and the cost estimating standard error. IS ~\u00ad\nsumed to be 15%. The standard error for the sum of the two somces of uncertainty IS \n\nthe root sum square \n(u? + ue 2)lfl = (0.22 + O.152)lfl = 0.25 (20-1) \n\nwhere (1, is the cost standard deviation in technology and ue is the cost estimating \nc~ty. Thus the uncertainty standard deviation is 25% of the MLE for the sub-\n\n:stem. The input to the above equation will be ob.tained .from Table 20-~5 for the ut \nand from Tables 20-4, 20-5, and 20-6 for the UC' This proVIdes the uncertainty measure \n\nfor a subsystem. . \nFor an entire system, the probability sum is more complex. We cannot ~lUlply use \n\nthe root sum square since there are correlations between subsystems. That I~, mterre-\nlationships exist between the development of s~systems.

The treatment of cost/reliability relationships (that is the risk \nassOCIated With the failure of flight units) is discussed in Sec. 19.2 and by Gupta and \nAltshuler [1989]. A more comprehensive treatment of analytical methods and th \nmeth?rl of mo~ents to a~ss cos~ risk, as well as Monte Carlo simulation methOO: \nmentioned earlIer, are given by Wilder [1978], Abramson and Young [1990], Book \n[~993], Burgess.and Gobrieal [1996], and Young [1992). The end product of cost-\nnsk ass~sment In this framework is a total spacecraft cost-probability distribution. \nfrom which th~ mean. standard deviation. percentiles, and other descriptive statistics \ncan be ~etenmned. (See Fig. 20-4 for an example cost estimate probability density \nevaluation.) \n\n20.4.2 Time Spreading of Costs \n\nPrior sec~ons have focused upon developing total cost estimates. We now address \nhow costs will be spread over time. The following analytical cost spreadin method \nwas developed by Wynholds and Skratt [1977] and approximates the expe~ence of \nactual programs. \n~e spreading of the costs to determine funding profIles can be approximated by a \n\nfunction of the form: \n\nF(S) = A [10 + S \u00ab15 - 4S)S - 20)]S2 + B [10 + S (6S - 15)]5'3 \n+ [1 - (A + B)](5 - 4S)S4 (20-3) \n\nwhere F(S) is the fraction of cost consumed in time S, S is the fraction of the total time \nelapsed. and A and B are empirical coefficients. \n~ values f?C the coefficients A and B depend on the expected loading of costs \n\nover time. For Instance, a typical period for RDT &E and two production units . \n5 years. The costs are usually heavier during the first 2 years when design devel; \nment and testing occur. ~ically, 60% .of the costs will be incurred by th~ midpoint \nof the schedule. The coeffiCients for vanous spending splits are: \n\n% Expenditure \nat schednle midpoint \n\nCoefficients in Eq. (20-3) \nA B \n\n80 0.96 0.04 \n60 0.32 0.68 \n50 o 1.00 \n40 o 0.68 \n20 o 0.04 \n\nA ~% distribution is suggested for the RDT &E and production of the fIrst several \nsatellites. If ~ore than tw'? satellites are included. the 60% decreases toward a limit of \n50%. A SpecifIc example IS provided in Sec. 20.5. \n\nAnother sc~edul~-related i~ue that we may address is present value, which is based \nupon the con~lderation. of the time value of money. One dollar in 2000 is worth more \n~ a d~llar In 2~5, SInce the 2000 dollar could be invested and earn a return so that \nIts value In 2005 IS more than one dollar (in constant 2000 dollars) This al . \n\nuld .. . v ue Increase wo occur even Without inflation. \n\n20.4 Other Topics 807 \n\nTo illustrate the present value concept, consider a cost comparison of two projects. \nBoth projects have satisfIed all technical requirements. Project A has a three year \ndevelopment consisting of funding requirements of $10 million, $5 million, and \n$1 million in constant 2000 dollars. Project B has a funding profIle of $1 million. \n$5 million, and $10 million in 2000 dollars. Thus, the totals are the same for both. \nHowever, the buyer of this project, government or otherwise, will prefer the second \nproject on an economic basis since it will expend most of the funds in the future rather \nthan the near term. The buyer of Project B could invest the $9 million excess funds in \nthe first year and have additional funds at the end of the project. The conv~ti~ way \nof handling a comparison is to compute the present value for both projects usmg a \ndiscount rate. The discount rate is the time value of money. The appropriate disco~t \nrate is controversial. If possible, treat the disco~t rate as a parameter and .determIne \nat what point, if any, there is a crossover in the discount rate where one project would \nbe preferred over another. A 10% rate is a standard value for study purposes. \n\nThe present value, PV, is obtained by multiplying the funding for each year by the \nfactor: \n\nPV= 1 \n(l+dt 1 \n\n(20-4) \n\nwhere n is the year of project (relative to the constant dollar year), and d is the discount \nrate. \n\nFor project A, the present value at a 10% discount rate is \n\nPYA = 10/(1 + 0.1)0 + 51(1 + 0.1)1 + 1/(1 + 0.1)2 = 15.4 in $ Millions \nFor project B, the present value is \n\nPVB= 1/(1 + 0.1)0 + 5/(1 + 0.1)1 + 10/(1 + 0.1)2 = 13.8 in $ Millions \nThus, project B is less expensive than project A by $1.6 million or roughly 10% in \npresent value terms. \n\nZO.4.3 Rough Order-of-Magnitnde Cost Estimates \n\nAs concepts are developed. it is helpful to have an ~timate of the anticipated c~ts. \nBy making \"sanity\" estimates, we can develop some Idea of cost bounds.for vanous \nconcepts. Table 20-16 gives.estimated costs in constant 2000 dollars. These should be \nused to give rough order of magnitude costs for missions un~er ~onsi~on. \n\nFor example, we can estimate the cost of four commumcation satellites (TORS-\nclass). two in each of two orbit planes with launches from both ~ Eastern and \nWestern Test Ranges using two Titan IV/Centaurs. Table 20-16 proVides an order-of-\nmagnitude cost of: \n\nSatellites: 4 x $126M $504 million \n\nand Table 20-14 provides an order of magnitude cost of: \n\nLaunches: 2 x $333M ~ million \n\nTotal $1,170 million \n\n\n\n808 CostModeJiug 20.4 \n\nTABLE 20-16.

Such quick computations can also be used as a cross check for \nestimates obtained from the cost models of Sec. 20.3. \n\n20.4.4 Learning Curve \n\nHistorically. the majority of satellites built and flown have been one-of-a-kind sys-\ntems. However with the prolifemtion of constellations where recurring costs and learn-\ning rates dominate the cost equation, a breakout of developmental and theoretical first \nunit costs is necessary. \n\nWe can adjust the single-spacecraft CERs to correct for cost reduction from \nlearning how to do the job better or the effects of changing technological status. CERs \neffectively predict costs for developing a prototype or first production unit, often \ncalled the theoretical first unit. but they poorly estimate the cost for even the most \nmodest production line. The staff who manufactures a second or third similar \nspacecraft will learn to do the job better and use economies of scale. which quantifi-\nably improve performance. The learning mte for the space and the aerospace industry \nis such that. on avemge, the Nth unit will cost between 87% and 96% of the previous \nunit. \n\nThe learning curve is a mathematical technique to account for productivity \nimprovements as a larger number of units are produced. It includes all cost reductions \nbetween the first production unit and subsequent units. This includes cost reductions \ndue to economies of scale. set up time, and human learning as the nlimber of units \nincrease. The total production cost for N units is modeled as: \n\nwhere \n\nProduction cost = TFU xL \n\nB == 1- In\u00abI00%) I S) \nIn2 \n\n(20-5) \n\nTFU is the theoretical first unit cost, L is the learning curve factor, and S is the learn-\ning curve slope in percent. This form of the learning curve was chosen because of its \nfit to empirical data, based on the theory ofT.P. Wright [1936]. \n\nThe learning curve slope S represents the percentage reduction in cumulative \naverage cost when the number of production units is doubled. The learning curve slope \nS sets the value of B. For example: if S = 95% and the first unit costs $1 million. then \ndoubling the number to 2 units reduces the average cost of both to 95% of the first unit. \nThus, the two units cost $1.9 million. The second unit cost is $0.9 million. The learn-\ning curve exponent B is 0.926 for S = 95%. \n\nFor less than 10 units, we recommend a 95% learning curve slope be applied. \nBetween 10 and 50 units, a 90% learning curve and 85% for over 50 units is appropri-\nate. These will vary with the application and how the manufacturing and assembly \nactivities are set up. The cost models presented earlier provide first unit costs so that \ntotal production costs are determined by multiplying 1FU costs by the learning curve \nfactor. . \n\n\n\n1 \n\ni \n\n810 Cost ModeHng \n2005 \n\nThe following example table illustrates the impact of a 95% learning curve on unit \ncosts. The unit or marginal cost is the difference in production cost between N units \nand N - 1 units. Fot example, the cost of the fifth unit is the difference in production \ncost between the fourth and fifth units, that is, 4.44 - 3.61 = 0.83. \n\nEifeet ora 95% Learning Curve \nUnit Productiou Average Unit Number Cost tI'FU x L) Cost Cost 1 1.00 1.00 1.00 2 1.90 0.95 0.90 3 2.77 0.92 0.87 4 3.61 0.90 0.84 5 4.44 0.89 0.83 \n\n20.5 FireSat Example \n\nJohn T. Collins, Microcosm, Inc. \n\nWe will apply the above cost models to the FueSat example to compute Jife-cycJe \ncost estimates for the entire mission. We assume that two satellites are needed initially \nand that both are launched into a 150-km orbit by a Pegasus XL launch vehicle. The \nWBS consists of the space, launch, and ground segments. The space element consists \nof two satellites with infrared sensor payloads. The launch segment is two vehicles. \nThe ground segment will consist of a single ground control station. All of the neces-\nsary data is given in Table 20-3. \n\nTo illustrate the use of the CERs in Tables 20-4, 20-5, and 20-6, the cost estimates \nwill be developed to the spacecraft subsystem level. The weight, beginning of life \npower, sensor aperture diameter, and other technical characteristics are the key pa-\nrameters for the estimate. The specific v.alues are in Tables 20-17 and 20-18. The \nhardware RDT &E cost is based upon the CERs of Table 20-4 and 20-6 (nonrecur-\nring portion) modified by the design status factors listed at the bottom of Table 20-8. \nThe production costs are the result of the TFU CERs of Table 20-5 and 20-6 (recur-\nring portion) multiplied by a learning curve factor L = 1.9 for two units. The com-\nputation of L is described in Sec. 20.4.4. The subsequent or second unit cost is then \nthe difference between the production cost of two units and the TFU. The results for \nthe large satellite cost model (based largely on USCM 7.0) indicate the IR payload \ncontributes most to overall system cost. Thus, the payload sensor should dominate \nattempts to reduce cost \n\nProgram-level costs are added based on the CERs in Tables 20-4, 20-5, and 20-6. \nGround support equipment costs are then computed from Tables 20-4 and 20-6 based \non RDT &E and first unit hardware costs. The launch operations and orbital support \ncosts are obtained from Table 20-5 and 20-6. Fmally, the satellite software costs are \nbased upon Table 20-10 using Ada. This yields a total space segment cost of $549M \nusing the USCM 7.0 model and $44M using the smallsat model. The large discrepancy \nin total space segment cost is due largely to the vast difference in cost between the pay_ \nload cost estimates for each model. The large satellite cost model yields an estimate of \n\n20.5 FireSat Example 811 \n\nh Seg nt Costs In FYOO$K. Cost estimates based TABLE 20-17.

The primary drivers for mass mcrease as a function of mcreasmg \ndesign life are: \n\n1. The requirement for additional propellant for on-orbit station keeping; \n2. A need for more capable subsystems, for example the power subsystem where \n\nsolar cell and battery degradation requires oversizing the system to meet a \n. new higher beginning-of-Iife power requirement; and \n\n3. Full redundancy assumed for 7-year lifetime. \n\n\n\n816 Cost Modeling 20.5 \n\nWe chose mass-based CERs and assume that payload requirements and perfor-\n~ance p~ters such as pointing accuracy, downlink data rate, data storage, and \nSIZe remam fixed. The results are shown in tabular form in Table 20-24. Mass-based \nCERs are favored over the performance-based CERs. \n\nTABLE 20-24. FlreSat Mass, Power and Cost as a FuncUon of Design life.

Spacecraft pow-\ner estimates, used only as intermediate results, demonstrate required growth in the \npower subsystem as a function of lifetime. Our required propellant mass increases as \nwell. When the margin goes negative we are\u00b7 forced to launch Frresat on the more \ncapable Athena 1 (costs $18M compared with the $13M Pegasus XL). Operations \ncosts are not changed from our previous analysis of $6M per year. \n\n20.5 FireSat Example \n817 \n\nAggregate cost infonnation along with cost per year is shown in Fig. 20..5. This can \nbe compared with the notional representation in .Fig .. 1-5 and we hav~ completed ~e \nrequirements to design to cost cycle. Information hke that shown In Fig. 20-5 IS \nextremely useful for demonstrating how cost \"pushes back\" on .require\"!ents. When \nwe specified a mission life of 5 years, we did not ha.ve enough mfo?\"ation to know \nwhether this was the proper choice from a cost-effectiveness standpomt. Now that we \nhave completed the picture, we can see that (all factors co~side~) the. optiID:a~ life-\ntime for FireSat is between 4 and 6 years where the curve IS relatively msenslt1ve to \nfurther changes in design life. This is also about the time when we would expect that \nthe cost-effectiveness of the IR sensor payload and other components may become an \nissue. Even though amortized mission costs are lower, i.e., less dollars per year, there \nis proportionally less value. \n\nFlreSat Design Life Trade \n\n180 \n80 \n\n, \n___ Cost Per Year / / \n\n/ \n/ \n\n70 \n\n60 ~ \n\n~ \n\n160 \n\n140 \n\n/ \n\n'\" .., '\" - Total Cost -------- .., \nSpace Segment Cost/\" \n\n.., \n\n50 !!. .. \n40 \n\nas \n~ .. \n\n30 CD a. \n\n20 \n-; \n0 \n0 \n\n10 \n\n0 \n\n120 \n\n! 100 .. 80 \n0 \n0 \n\n60 \n\n40 \n\n20 \n\n0 \n\n--- --- -- --- -------~ \n-Launch Cost ------\n\n__ \u2022 - \u2022 - - \u2022 ..:.: Operations Cost \n\n0 2 3 4 5 6 7 \n8 \n\nSpacecraft Design LIfe (years) \n\nFIg. 20-5.

Op~l!1al \ndesign life is chosen at a point on the cost-per-year curve that Is relatively insensitive \nto changes in design life and while mission data still remains useful. \n\nThis analysis highlights an important role for shorter-Iiv~d sm.all satellites o~er \ntraditional large satellites. Since more rapid technology mfuslon may proVIde \nincreases in cost-performance, we should be able to take advantage of state-of-the-\nart technology available 5-6 years from now, instead of continuing to operate aD: ob-\nsolescent system. Therefore, we choo~e to utilize two FireSat payloa~s, each ~Ith a \n5-year lifetime, but expect that the second version of the satellite wIll have hIgher \nperformance per pound than what we designed with today'~ technology. We can \nlaunch a satellite every 5 years to assure that we don't expenence an ~uta~e or de-\nsign in extra mission life (with the mass and cost consequences shown 18 FIg. 20-5) \nif the second satellite is delayed. \n\n\n\n818 Cost Modeling \n\nReferences \n\nAbramson, Robert L. and Philip H.

Wirin, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs \n\nWhy Worry About Law and Policy? \nEngineers accustomed to precise answers often find that legal and political issues \n\nintrude on the space mission design process just when everything is going smoothly. \nHowever, I hope to shed some light on potential policy \"show stoppers,\" and more \nimportantly, provide some insight into legal thinking about space missions and valid, \neven critical, perils in the design process. \n\nPolicy results from balancing conflicting interests, so \"valid\" arguments may be \nrejected. Lawyers tend to give \"answers\" rather than an evaluation of political and \nlegal risks. They unfairly believe that individuals from other disciplines will not \nunderstand and appreciate the balancing of interests. General James V. Hartinger, first \nCommander of Space Command, put it succinctly, \"Lawyers are asked common sense \nquestions so often that they begin to believe they have common sense.\" The mission \nplanner should look to lawyers to evaluate policy and legal risks for various mission \nalternatives so they can be weighed along with technical factors. \n\nWhy worry about law and policy? The simple answer is that a perfect engineering \nsolution is useless until it can be implemented. An example is the Apstar satellite. It \nwas launched in July 1994 by the PRC without obtaining coordination from \"owners\" \nof nearby communications satellites as required by the International Telegraphic \nUnion>(ITU) regulations. Without the required consultations the satellite would not be \npermitted to transmit signals and therefore would be of little value. The result was a \nflurry of activity to conclude the negotiations quickly and this was accomplished a few \nmonths after launch. Had this been a U.S. launch it would have been postponed until \nthe proper authorizations were accomplished, resulting in needless expense. \n\n821 \n\n\n\n822 Limits on Mission Design 21.1 \n\nAnother example is the Shuttle mission 51C to retrieve the Palapa and Westar VI \nsatellites. These satellites remained in low-Earth orbit because the motors which \nshould have transferred them to geostationary orbit failed. Hughes and NASA engi-\nneers worked out the technical solutions in a little more than 6 weeks. The lawyers \nspent more than 6 months resolving the legal questions concerning ownership, salvage \nrights, insurance coverages, and release of liability between the insurance carriers \nWestern Union Company and the Indonesian government. Also Hughes Aircrafi \nCompany and NASA had to agree on technical roles, liability, and compensation \nbefore the recovery effort began. \n\nWithout the implementing legislation in the Commercial Space Act of 1998 the \nDOT was not authorized to license private organizations to Conduct space operations \nwhich included reentry of reusable space vehicles. This is a vital provision not only for \nNASA's X-33 and X-34 programs, but for companies building commercial reusable \nlaunch vehicles Which will need to renter the Earth's atmosphere after delivering their \npayloads to orbit. Moreover the law is now clear that launch and recovery by definition \nare not an export or import. The first private launch of the Conestoga downrange to \nMatagorda Island off Texas required an export license in addition to other licenses. \nThese additions to the law make way for commercial exploitation of new space oppor-\ntunities and begin to strip away some restrictions on space activity. \n\n21.1.1 Space Law \n\nFor a multinational project such as a space station, mission designers must recog-\nnize that lawyers from some nations approach policy and legal issues differently. \nEngland and her progeny are common law nations; all others are civil law nations. The \nlatter seek to establish civil codes ofIaw which in effect create all of the rules up front. \nCommon law nations, in contrast, see law as evolving to solve particular problems. \nThey look to past precedent and attempt to fashion a modem answer, while civil law \njudges apply the code and leave \"changes\" to legislators. \n. An interesting example of space law is that spacecraft have the right to pass over \nthe territory and air space of other nations without their consent, whereas aircraft do \nnot But no one has defined where space begins. The Russians proposed 100-110 km \nbecause aircraft presently cannot fly at that altitude, and space objects bum up in the \natmosphere below it. The U.S. position is to wait to see how technology will develop \nsince there have been no particular problems. Equatorial nations have argued in vain \nthat their sovereignty goes up to -36,000 km (geostationary orbit) so they can control \naccess and obtain compensation from space-faring nations who use slots above their \nterritory. \n\nSpace missions are inherently an international activity, because space touches the \nsovereign territory of every nation on Earth. We must, therefore, consider diverse \nviews on space issues. For example, space-faring nations may diverge from the feel-\nings of developing nations, or Eastern and Western nations may disagree. Differences \nof opinions can arise from different cultures, economic status, political imperatives, \nand world view. \n\nInternational law, including space law, evolves in part from treaties. including the \nl!.N. Charter and U.N. resolutions plus organic documents of international organiza_ \ntions. It also depends on the practice of nations, as well as the writings of established \nauthorities. Unlike U.S. domestic law, space law has no legislature to write the rules \nand no court to enforce them. Sovereign nations enter into treaties but may disregard \n\n21.1 Law rind Policy Considerations 823 \n\nthem when they no longer serve their national security needs. The U.N. may pass \nresolutions, but they are not absolutely binding even when unanimous. Besides. \ntreaties tend to have ambiguous language. permitting a nation to pursue its best inter-\nests. An example is Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty, which says that the Moon \nand other celestial bodies shall be used exclusively for \"peaceful purposes.\" whatever \nthat means. \n\nThe International Court at the Hague does band-down decisions. but nations must \nusually agree to have the Court hear the case. Even when they do. there is no effective \nmechanism to enforce a decision. Having said all this, we must not conclude that space \nlaw has no value. There is a body of rules and a general understanding among nations \nas to what is proper and improper in space. Nevertheless, even though they may be \nambiguous and no policeman enforces them, treaties are seldom if ever ignored. \n\nBasic Do's and Don'ts: The Outer Space Treaty of 196'7* \nAs the so-called Principles Treaty. this document Jays down the basic philosophy \n\nand legal principles for outer space. In general, it says what should or should not be \ndone, but does not spell out how to implement a given policy. Its preamble emphasizes \nthat international cooperation is essential and recognizes that exploring space is in the \ncommon interest of all mankind. It goes further to declare that exploration should \nbenefit all peoples. Provisions of the treaty include: . \n\n\u2022 All nations may scientifically investigate space. with international cooperation \nencouraged. \n\n\u2022 No nation may claim sovereignty over outer space, including the Moon and \nother celestial bodies. As an illustration, Neil Armstrong claimed the Moon for \nmankind (not the United States) by stating that the mission had taken \"One \nsmall step for a man. one giant leap for mankind.\" The American flag was \npresent, but not to claim new territory. as Columbus and other explorers did \nwhen they came to the New World. \n\n\u2022 The rules in space will follow the established principles and rules of intema-\ntionallaw and the U.N. Charter. \n\n\u2022 No nation will place nuclear weapons or any other weapons of mass destruc-\ntion in orbit around the Earth. or on the Moon, or on other celestial bodies. This \nrestriction does not apply to nuclear power sources. The Treaty Banning \nNuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere. in Outer Space and Under Water \n(August 5. 1963) prohibits tests but not placement of nuclear devices in space. \n\n\u2022 Nations must use the Moon and other celestial bodies exclusively for ''peaceful \npurposes.\" but they may use military personnel in scientific research. The U.S. \ndefines peaceful as \"non-aggressive.\" thus permitting defensive measures. \n\n\u2022 Astronauts are envoys of mankind. So long as they conform to accepted rules \nof activity in space. they have a form of immunity. Therefore. we must return \nthem to their home nation promptly, and implicitly, may not charge to rescue \nthem. The Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts. the Return of Astronauts. \n\n\u2022 The classic treatise on space policy is by Professor Carl Q. Christol, The Modem International \nLaw of.Outer Space, Pergamon Press. New York (1982). Other m~terial is ~ the annual \nreports of the Colloquium on the Law of Outer Space, by the International Institute of Space \nLaw, publisbed by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Washington. DC. \n\nI ... ~ \n\n\n\n824 Limits on Mission Design 21.1 \n\nand the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space (April 22, 1968) could \nalso apply. \n\n\u2022 Recovered space objects must go back to the launching nation at its request \nand expense. \n\n\u2022 Nations bear international responsibility for their activities in outer space, \nwhether done by governmental agencies or private citizens. Thus, the U.S. \nmust authorize and continuously supervise all space activities of its citizens. \nThis requirement is unique to space activities, resulting from a compromise \nbetween the U.S. and the former USSR. The USSR had insisted that only \ngovernments should be permitted to go into space, whereas the U.S. insisted \non permission for private entrepreneurs. The Commercial Launch Act of 1984 \nwas enacted partly to carry out the U.S. obligations under the 1967 Outer \nSpace Treaty. It has been amended from time to time to update policies and \nprocedures. \n\n\u2022 Launching nations are liable for damages to citizens of other nations caused by \nnational and private launch activities. The Convention on International Liabil-\nity for Damage Caused by Space Objects (March 29, 1972) could also apply. \n\n\u2022 Nations must maintain a register of their launches. The purpose is to establish \nownership, jurisdiction, and control over the spacecraft and its personnel. In \nessence. a U.S. spacecraft or space station is its sovereign territory. Other \nnations retain jurisdiction over their spacecraft and modules even when \nattached to another's station. Space debris falls in the same category. making \nclean-up politically difficult. Launches are also reported to the U.N. to provide \nan opportunity for the world community to learn about space activity. If a sat-\nellite or other space object were not registered, it would be considered a rogue \nand likely forfeit any legitimate status and protection under the Outer Space \nTreaty or international law . It would be awkward to put in a claim for damage \nto such a satellite under the liability convention. A nation that chooses for any \nreason not to play by the rules. cannot easily demand their enforcement. Of \ncourse, policy and politics would also restrain it from complaining. \n\n\u2022 The Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space \n(January 4, 1975) requires a launching nation to advise the U.N. Secretary \nGeneral of the following: name of the launching nation, description or regis-\ntration number, date and location of launch, basic orbital parameters (nodal \nperiod, inclination, apogee. and perigee) and general function of the space \nobject. A nation need not update this information but may do so if it wishes. \n\n\u2022 Nations must conduct space activities so as to avoid harming or contaminating \nthe environment. Project West Ford influenced this provision. In 1963. the \nU.S. placed 480 million copper dipoles into orbit 2,000 miles above the Earth \nin an attempt to create an artificial ionosphere to enable radio messages to \nbounce from coast to coast. The in-honse name for the project was Needles. \nwhich was an unfortunate choice. Complaints came from astronomers who \nwere convinced the belt of copper needles would ruin their view of the uni-\nverse. They also thought it might lead to worse experiments. The Soviets said, \n''What if one of the needles pierces the heart of a cosmonaut or puts out some-\none's eye when it reenters the atmosphere?\" Although these objections were \n\n21.1 Law and PoHcy Considerations 825 \n\nnot reasonable, public ignorance made them real. Simply put, even though the \nproject caused no significant problems. the planners had failed to Consider \nfully the effects of adverse public opinion. A key question you won't find writ-\nten anywhere is, \"Does it pass the common sense test?\" Project West Ford \nfailed. Space law now requires that if a project might cause harm or interfer-\nence with others, international consultations must occur before it proceeds (see \nSec. 21.1.6 on Environmental Concerns). Planners should also review the \nConvention on the Prohibition of Military or any Other Hostile Use of \nEnvironmental Modification Techniques (May 18. 1977) if they anticipate \nlarge-scale effects. \nNuclear reactors in space create an environmental concern because they cause \ngamma-ray interference with some scientific satellites. NASA's Solar Maxi-\nmum Mission is a case in point; its gamma-ray spectrometer suffered interfer-\nence from reactors on Soviet radar satellites for ocean reconnaissance \n(RORSATs). If we plan a project such as the Gamma Ray Observatory, we \nmust evaluate precautions and risks. At the same time. if we plan to use a \nnuclear power source for a mission. we must consider possible effects and \nprotests. Some legislators in the U.S. have proposed a ban on the use of \nnuclear power sources in space. Although Congress is not likely to pass such a \nmeasure, the proposed ban illustrates environmental concerns. \n\n\u2022 Stations on the Moon and other celestial bodies shall be open mutually to \nrepresentatives of other nations after reasonable advance notice. Even this \ngeneral language does not apply in space to space stations. shuttles, platforms, \nor satellites. Neither by treaty. international law. nor custom may anyone \ninspect sovereign facilities in space. Although the U.S. may agree to inspec-\ntions. on the Moon. Russia has taken a very stern stand against inspections; \ntherefore, in my opinion, these inspections are unlikely. The Antarctic Treaty. \nin contrast, allows unannounced inspection of stations, installations, and \nequipment; therefore we must not confuse these provisions with those of the \nOuter Space Treaty. The Antarctic Treaty permits unconditional free access at \nall times. This could change if there were more than scientific interest in \nAntarctica. The Moon Treaty of 1979 has extensive inspection provisions but \nlittle force or effect. because no space-faring nation of the West or East ratified \nit. The \"common heritage of mankind\" provisions. which envision sharing \nprofits with all nations even though they have not contributed. is a major stick-\ningpoint. \n\nConflicts Between U.s. Law and International Law \n\nFederal statutes and treaties are of equal authority. If a statute and a treaty conflict, \nthe later in time controls (87 Corpus Juris Segundum Treaties 89). Therefore, statutes \nand regulations may control the activities of U.S. industry and government, even to the \nextent of revoking portions of an earlier international agreement or treaty. \n\nSoteUite Telecommunications. Communications have been the most commercially \nprofitable use of space. with primary applications in telephone. telegraph, television. \nand data transmissions. The unique properties of the stationary orbit over the equator. \nwhich permits stationary positioning of a satellite. make it a limited natural resource. \nSpace ai: 35,680 km above the Earth is ample to accommodate many satellites with \nlittle risk of collision. But the radio frequency and its bandwidth limit spacing to 2 deg \n\n\n\n826 Limits on Mission Design 21.1 \n\nin order to .avoid interference. Reducing this spacing further will be expensive. The \nITU authonzes an~ controls the effective use of geostationary orbits and frequencies. \nUnder the International Telecommunication Convention and Vmal Protocol (Nairobi \n1982) and the ITU's radio regulations, the system uses a ''first-come, first-served': \npr~urc:; o~ce a satellitt: is.registered with the ITU no subsequent system may inter-\nfere WIth Its Signal transmISSion. Generally, a similar replacement will retain the rights \nof a registered satellite. \n\nA. n~~ of co~cerns over allocation of slots led to a call for a Space World \nAdmmtslrative Radio Conference in 1985, which reconvcned in 1988 and 1992. In \np~cular, developing nations worried that no slots would be left for them. A compro-\nmIse left the conventional part of C and Ku radio frequency bands allocated only to \nthe Fixed Satellite Service on a ''first-come, first-served\" basis. At the same time all \nnations could obtain orbital slots and frequency channels on the expansion part of the \nService's frequency bands. Policies set up at the ftrst two W ARCs began to be im-\nplemented a! the r.n0st ~nt conference. However, it was also apparent that this \nImI?lementation ~ll continue to evolve as power shifts among participants. The \nn~tions also occasIOnally hold multilateral planning meetings to resolve area con~ \nflicts between themselves. Access to all other radio frequency bands allocated to all \nother satellite services is still \"ftrst-come, first-served\" except the 12 GHz and 17 GHz \nbands for Broadcasting Satellite Service. \n\nIn exercising its registration. functio~, ~e International Frequency Registration \nBoard does not evaluate the particular nation s reasons for making a particular assign-\n~nt. The. Board seeks o~y to ensure that the national assignment conforms to iden-\nlifted servIces for the asSIgned frequency and that transmissions do not interfere with \nother broadcasts. Nations then determine how they will parcel out the allocated \nfrequencies to their people. \n. If a proposed satellite could cause interference, the sponsoring nation resolves \nISSUes under negotiation procedures established by the ITU. The ITU conducts much \nof its techni~al activi~es through ~e International Frequency Registration Board and \nthe Interna~onal ~adio C::0nsultative Committee. Since 1973, orbital positions have \nbeen assocIated With particular frequencies and technical characteristics. \n\n~. the U.S., the FCC allocates orbital slots and frequencies. To obtain an orbital \n~Sltion or frequency, your legal department's FCC expert submits a formal applica-\ntion. The approval process may take 3 to 5 years for a new communications service or \nup to a year for an existing satellite. \n. An ongoing concern is the need to protect the GPS spectrum from disruption and \nmterference. The Etm?peans at the World Administrative Conference in 1997 sought \nto ?v~rlay a commercial ~adcast signal ?n the public service radionavigation band. \nThis Issue was addressed m the CommercIal Space Policy Act of 1998 with the Con-\ngress e~couragin~ regional agreements with foreign countries. like the 1998 agree-\nment WIth JaI?aD' m order to make the U.S. GPS signal a globally accepted standard. \n. Commercilll Launches. Commercial launch planners must consider the Commer-\n\nCial Launch Act of 1984. As amended, it requires the DOT to approve and license all \ncomme~al ex~ndable vehicles if launched from U.S. territory or by a U.S. citizen or \ncorporation outside the U.S. \n\nAs the. F~deral ~egister indicates, before issuing a launch license the DOT requires \n~th a mISSion ,reView and a safety review. The first review focuses on the payload \nItself and the flight.p!~. to ensure. that ~ mission is in accord with U.S. policy and \nmeets U.S. responSibIlities under mternational treaties. Regulations require the DOT \n\n21.1 Law and Policy Considerations 8:27 \n\nto review how missions affect national interests. Although some fear this authority will \nbe used to block missions, Congress has declared privately conducted commercial \nlaunches to be consistent with the national security and foreign policy interests of the \nU.S. Time will tell what limitations will be imposed, but the Commercial Launch Act \nthus far gives government considerable power over commercial activity. \n\nThe DOT also reviews procedures for launch safety, including: \n\n\u2022 Procedures for safety controls for launch sites and flight corridors \n\n\u2022 Range safety expertise \n\n\u2022 Procedures for ground and flight safety \n\u2022 Range tracking and instrumentation \n\n\u2022 Vehicle safety systems \n\n\u2022 Proposed vehicle design \n\nFor the foreseeable future, I expect this review to be conservative. Missions using \nproven government launchers and national launching facilities should receive quick \napproval. But a mission proposing to use a new and untested vehicle or launch site will \nsuffer close scrutiny. \n\nDOT must coordinate commercial launches with all other interested agencies in the \nFederal Government, particularly the DoD and the Department of State. For current \nguidelines, contact the FAA. \n\nThe policy is now to require maximum utilization of commercial launch capabiHty \nby the federal government. This includes planning missions in such a way so that they \nmatch the space transportation capabilities of our commercial launch providers. The \nmain exceptions are national security or international collaborative efforts relating to \nscience or technology. Congress additionally mandated in the Commercial Space Act \nof 1998 that DoD study Vandenberg AFB and Cape Canaveral Air Station to see what \nupgrades are needed to enable a flourishing commercial launch industry. \n\nMilitary Spaee Activities. The development, testing, and deployment of a space-\nbased defensive system must abide by the terms of the Anti-Ballistic Missile limita-\ntions Treaty between the U.S. and the USSR (October 3, 1972). Administration policy \nwill determine whether the U.S. will develop this system. \n\nWe also must acknowledge the possibility that international partners of the U.S. \nmay object to legitimate national security activity. For example, our allies who signed \nup to help us develop the Space Station took exception to its potential undeftned DoD \nactivities, which they took to be SOl activities. CaDada announced it would withdraw \nsupport for Space Station Freedom if the U.S. chose to conduct military activities, \nunless those activities were limited to research. \n\nPatent Issues. Patent law and intellectual property rights in the U.S. stem from the \nfust national patent law enacted in 1790. It was based upon the U.S. Constitution \n(1787), article 1, section 8, paragraph 8 that states, \"Congress shall have power to \u2022.. \npromote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors \nand inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.\" That \nlimited period in the U.S. is now 20 years from the date of ftling for the patent with the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office. \n\nThe U.S. law did not cover \"space\" so the U.S. Space Bill was enacted in 1990. It \nprovides that, \"Any invention made, used or sold in outer space on a space object of \ncomponent thereof under the jurisdiction or control of the United States shall be \nconsidered to be made, used or sold within the United States.\" This legislation follows \n\n\n\n828 Limits on Mission Design 21.1 \n\nthe \"flagship\" principle, which applies U.S. laws to ships on the high seas and aircraft \nflying over international water. With regard to the International Space Station, the \nInternational Governmental Agreement provides \"... for purposes of intellectual \nproperty law, an activity occmring in or on a Space Station flight element shall be \n~med to have occurred only in the territory of the Partner State of that element's reg-\nIStry, except that for ESA-registered elements any European Partner State may deem \nthat activity ... occurred within its territory.\" \n\nIn view of the U.S. Space Bill, the IGA, the Registration Convention and the \nprovisions on registration in the Outer Space Treaty in appears that U.S. law is the law, \nwhich is most often applicable. In situations where U.S. law is not applicable there are \nno clear answers, and therefore considerable commercial risk to space missions from \nboth a policy and economic perspective may be present \n\nThe mission planner should be aware of two patent cases. Hughes Aircraft \nCompanylWilliams in 1973 obtained a patent relating to the spin stabilization of \nsatellites to assure obtaining and maintaining satellite attitude on orbit Hughes Air-\ncraft Company sued the U.S. Government for infringement of its patent, because the \ngovernment nsed the concept without paying for it. It was not until 1983 that multi-\nbillion-dollar decision against the Government was handed down after the U.S. and \nothers had launched 108 satellites, which infringed the patent rights of Hughes Aircraft \nCo~pany. The lesson is clear; patent infringement may have very significant eco-\nnOmIC consequences \n\nThe second concern stems from a patent granted to TRW /Horstein et al. in 1995. \nPatent rights are based upon the \"claims\" in the patent application. The main claim of \nthis patent in essence is an \"orbital shell\" above the Earth from 5,600 to 10,000 \nnautical miles reserved for TRW exclusively, for all communications applications to \nmobile handsets. Soon after the patent was granted TRW sued ICO Global Communi-\ncations Ltd. to prevent them from launching satellites into the proscribed altitudes. The \ncase was dismissed because there was no present infringement. \n\nNevertheless, this is a troublesome patent, because it flies directly in the face of the \n~te~ Space ,!,~ty provisi~n~ on nonappropriation of space by any nation including \nIts pnvate entities. In my opmIOn the patent IS fatally flawed if it is interpreted to give \nany property rights to a spatial location. Were another nation to raise the issue in the \nU.N. or some other forum, the U.S., under its treaty obligations, would have no alter-\nnative but to \"correct\" the situation by legislation or cause a review of the original \npatent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A mission planner must, however, \nface the risks of litigation, Which entail not only lost time but also the economic \nconsequences. \n\n21.1.2 U.s. Space Polley \nA cohesive, consistent U.S. space policy does not exist. This conclusion follows \n\nfrom the lack of success of the program to get us into space. It has not reached new \ntechnological or cultural plateaus nor even maintained the initial pace. \n\nWhat then must the mission planner consider from a U.S. policy prospective in \nmission design? Policy direction can change so quickly that the shorter the design and \nconstruction cycle, the better. Experience teaches us that government funding for \nprojects can evaporate overnight. This being the case; get your money up front if \nIJ<?Ssible, or ~t least attempt to obtain ''fenced\" funding.\u00b7 For government projects you \nWIll need a smgle powerful backer or several who can provide funding. Political and \neconomic support may be available from various sources. However, the advantage of \n\n21.1 Law and PoHcy Considerations 829 \n\n. securing interest and support from a number of sources may be more than offset by the \nnecessity to serve various conflicting goals. \n\nPolicy edicts may be forthcoming from an administration, particularly the National \nSpace Council, vocal committees of the Congress, and of course, industry groups. Do \nnot be misled by the apparent credibility of the source or the clarity of the proposed \ngoal. Words are cheap. All too often promises are made but are not backed up with \nbudgeting and funding. \n\nEven if you are doing a commercial project you will need an expert to advise you \non national space policy sensitivities. The problem is you do not need to find \nfriends-you only need to avoid enemies. The most likely enemies are potential com-\npetitors. While they probably cannot block your project directly, they may have \nfriends in government who can. Accordingly, if it is possible, design the project in \nsuch a way that it is cooperative with others and not in direct competition. You should \nalso be careful to assess what law and policy implications may arise from the proposed \nmission. These concerns may IJe national and international. \n\nAn example of this intergovernmental coordination was the effort by Space Indus-\ntries, Inc., to secure government funding for the ISF (Industrial Space Facility). \nHoping to get a fast start, they submitted the proposal to a congressional committee \nwithout adequate coordination with NASA and other interested governmental agen-\ncies. They were successful in getting support from the committee and the National \nSpace Council. They were even mentioned specifically in President Reagan's 198.8 \nspace policy report. All of this withered and died because they had not made theIr \npeace with the supporters of the Space Station who felt that money spent on the ISF \nwould be taken from Space Station funding and might ultimately result in the Space \nStation project being reduced or cancelled. The net result was that the ISF became tied \nup in red tape and did not get funding. . . \n\nThe bottom line is that space mission analysis and design must concern Itself WIth \nthe vagaries of policy and the multitude of concerns and interests that exist in the \npolitical arena. \n\nTighter constraints of federal budgets and an increasing demand for some form of \neconomic return on federal investments has led to insistence by Congress that the \nfederal government work with industry and buy from the private sector when possible. \nThe 1998 legislation requires NASA to identify opportunities for commercial pr0-\nviders to participate in the International Space Station and to study the possibility of \nturning the space shuttle operation plus the space station over to commercial operators \nafter it is assembled in orbit. ~dditionally space science data must be purchased from \ncommercial providers to the extent possible. \n\n21.1.3 Responsibility-Liability and Insurance \nThe Outer Space Treaty, Article VI, fIrst established a nation's responsibility for its \n\nacts in space, as well as those of its citizens acting privately. This provision .Iooks to \nthe future and requires a nation to authorize and continually supervise all of Its space \nactivity to assure it conforms with treaties and international law. We must take into \naccount this risk of regulation when we design a project and plan how to accommodate \ngovernmental supervision. \n\n\u2022 Fenced fimding is a term deriving from appropriations usage, meaning that monies allocated \nfor a certain purpose cannot be otherwise allocated. even within the SaDIe agency or \norganization. \n\n\n\n830 Limits on Mission Design 21.1 \n\nliability, the other side of the responsibility coin, looks to the past. The Outer Space \nTreaty, Article vn, fIrst specifIed Ii.ability for space activity. Then came the 1972 \nConvention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects. This \nConvention was intended to protect the nonspace-faring nations, so it held space-\nfaring nations absolutely liable if they caused injury or damage on Earth. Absolute \nliability simply means that someone who is injured may claim compensation just by \nproving damage and who did it, without having to demonstrate negligence or fault If \ndamage occurs in space, however, space-faring nations must prove fault to recover \ndamages. \n\nThe procedure for settling claims calls fIrst for negotiations by the nations involved. \nThe only claimant under the Convention is another nation, bringing a claim on its own \nbehalf or on behalf of its citizens. If these negotiations fail, a three-member claims \ncommission is fonned. Each nation involved appoints one member. The two appointed \nmembers then appoint a third, the chainnan. \n\nThe fmt case under this Convention involved the reentry of Cosmos 954 over the \nNorthwest Territory of Canada on January 24, 1978. Negotiations between Canada \nand the USSR were successful. The nuclear reactor scattered radioactive debris over \n124,000 km2\u2022 The search and recovery effort (Operation Morning Light) cost Canada \nalmost $14M Canadian dollars, but it settled for $3M. Canada elected not to claim the \ncost of $8M for its officials and employees nor for equipment. The USSR argued that \nCanada was too meticulous in the clean-up opemtions and that if this event had \noccurred in Siberia, she would not have expended that much effort. Additionally, the \nUSSR asserted that she had offered to help clean up, but Canada rejected the offer. Had \nshe been permitted to help, the costs would have been much less. This amicable settle-\nment for 50% of the claim set a positive precedent for the future. \n\nUnder the Liability Convention, the U.S. must pay when her space activities injure \ncitizens of other nations or their property. U.S. citizens may recover for personal injury \nor damage under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Thus, the government requires insur-\nance before authorizing a commercial launch. Government launches, both military and \ncivil, do not have formal insurance covemge, as the government is a self-insurer. If the \ngovernment suffers a loss, it allocates more funds from the public coffers. \n\nFor commercial launches and potentially those conducted for foreign governments, \nwe need to consider the following types of insurance: \n\n\u2022 Pre-Launch. Pre-launch coverage insures against the risks from damage \nduring shipment of the launcher and the satellite, as well as during integmtion \nand movement to the launch pad. \n\n\u2022 Government Equipment. The government now requires launches on commer-\ncial expendable vehicles to provide insurance for loss to government launch \nequipment and facilities. The Commercial Space Launch Act (amended 1988) \ncaps the amount at $lOOM. The Secretary of Transportation determines for \neach launch vehicle ifless is appropriate; examples are $75M for the Atlas and \n$80M for either the Titan or Delta. \n\n\u2022 Third-Pari] Liobility. Launch vehicle opemtors and satellite owners may \ncause injury to others through the reentry. The risk is small because these \nobjects generally bum up in the atmosphere during reentry. If they do not, they \nwould typically strike the ocean or one of the uninhabited areas that make up \nmost of the Earth's surface. Because of this low risk, covemge is less expen-\n\n21.1 Law and PoHcy Considerations 831 \n\nsive though still required by DOT for launch vehicles and sateJJites and by \nNASA for commercial satellites. \n\nWhen NASA was the only means of access to space for commercial satellites, \ntheir regulations established an insurance policy of $500M, with the gov-\nernment assuming the risk above that amount This limit was a pmctical one \nbecause the insurance community could not insure a greater amount Now that \ncommercial launch vehicles will be the prime means of transportation into \nspace, Congress has established a similar cap of $500M, until the world's \ninsurance community can provide greater covemge. The pmpose of this \nprovision of the 1988 Amendment to the Commercial Launch Act was to \nattempt to level the commercial playing fIeld as Arianespace requires an \nFF400M insurance policy. This amount was based upon the prior NASA pol-\nicy of requiring $500M covemge. \n\nPrivate opemtors of launch vehicles must also concern themselves with \nliability claims from citizens of the U.S. and around the world. The DOT reg-\nulations require covemge against this risk before issuing a launch license. \n\n\u2022 Launch Failure. The most expensive insurance covemge insures the satellite \nvalue from the moment of lift-off to on-orbit checkout The prices for this \ncovemge have risen from 50/0-10% of the satellite value to 250/0-30% and then \nsettled back to 16%-20%. Shuttle launches enjoyed about a 5% discount \nBecause it was a man-mted vehicle, the insurance community had a high con-\nfIdence in its reliability. In the early days, insurance companies charged very \nlow premiums for three reasons: they had few insurance losses; brokers knew \nlittle about space vehicles and the risks involved; and they competed to get into \nthe business tiecause space had pizazz. \n\nPremiums rose dramatically with the loss of the. Shuttle Challenger in 1986 \nand several failures of expendable launch vehicles shortly thereafter. In fact, \nthe space insurance community paid out 3 times more in loss claims than they \ntook in through premiums. Once the U.S. and Ariane progmms were back on \ntrack, premiums modemted. Still, as we plan commercial launches, we must \ntry to choose launch vehicles and satellites with a history of success. Other-\nwise, insurance probably will be unavailable or prohibitively priced. \n\n\u2022 Reflight. A coronary risk which the launch-vehicle manufacturer may cover is \na guarantee to refly the mission or indemnifIcation of the value of launch \nservice. Whether a company will provide either at no cost depends on the \nlaunch vehicle's past experience and the competitive climate. A contract nor-\nmally covers this risk, but I am sure the insurance community would cover it \nfor a price. \n\n\u2022 Loss to Others on the Flight. Under provisions of NASA launch contracts, the \nrisk of damage to a payload by another payload or by NASA's actions falls \nunder a Hold Harmless Clause. This provision means that all parties to the \nlaunch agree not to sue each other regardless of what happens. This pmctical \nremedy came about because it is very difficult to calculate the risk and deter-\nmin~ the premium. The risk also seemed low, and experience bears out this \nassessment as no incidents have occurred. This solution is also true for com-\npanion satellites launched commercially. \n\n\n\ni \n,I \n\nI' , \nI \n\n832 Limits on Mission Design 21.1 \n\n\u2022 C!\"-Orbit Performance. A further risk concerns whether a satellite will con-\ntinue to pe~onn. Comm~ications satellites especially need coverage when \nthe launch Insurance tenrunates after on-orbit checkout Satellite owners must \nhave this ''life'' insurance coverage if they do not have sufficient resources to \n\"self insur~\" .the risks. Banks that ~nance communications systems usually \ndemand this msurance. An alternative may be enough satellites on orbit to \nback-up the system. . \n\nIn the pru:t, buyers ?f space services (particularly communications service) con-\n~ted to build a satellIte, sought a launch aboard the Shuttle or on Ariane, and then \n~~ t~ secure one ~r more of th.e insurance coverages explained above. But compe-\ntition m the satellite-construction and expendable-launch-vehicle industries has \nchangc:<l thi~ proced.ure. Instead, the buyer puts out a request for proposals calling for \n~n-orblt del~very ~Ith acceptance after checkout. This change shifts the burden and \nnsks. Onlr ~m~ ~Ill tell whether the ~ost to the buyer of a space service will be higher. \nIf competition IS mtense e~ough, whIch I predict it will be through the year 2010, the \ncost may decrease. If so, this turnkey package arrangement will be the nonn rather than \nthe exception. \n. One further note is appropri~te. It might appear reasonable for one of the aerospace \n\ngtan~anufacturer of satelhtes or expendable launch vehicles--to step up and \nproVIde Insurance guarantees themselves. But the IRS has taken the position that a cor-\npo~tion may not set aside funds from successful launches to act as a reserve, without \npapng tax~s on these funds. If companies could set aside untaxed reserves, they could \ngam a co~slderable economi~ advantage by offering insurance potentially unavailable \nfrom the msurance communIty, whose worldwide reserves are less than $20 billion \nAs ?D alternative, launch companies could acquire a block of insurance commitmen~ \nfor Its launches from the insurance community and offer these to customers to sweeten \na deal. \n\nIn a perfect worl?, a~tu~al risk would reflect the cost of risk plus overhead \nand profit. Cost of nsk IS SImply the total value of all losses experienced divided \nby the total number of events or launches. Unfortunately, despite manufacturers' \nqUO!ed success rates of 850/0-98%, we do not have enough total launches to derive ac-\ntuariaIl~ co~t fi~es. Ther~fore, the price of insurance tends to depend on ''feel'' \nand vanous mtangtbles. As pomted out above, failures drive prices up, and successes \n?ecrease them. Interestingly, these variations occur whether or not a failure was \nInsured. Spa~ insurers paid nothing for the 1986 Challenger disaster; yet they were so \nshak~ that msurance coverage was not available for a period of time. For up-to-\ndate I~surance coverage provisions and costs, contact Alexander and Alexander, \nWashington, DC; Coroon and Black, Bethesda, MD; or Marsh and McLennon Wash-\nington, DC. ' \n\n21.1.4 Remote Sensing \n\n. ~yone phl1l~ng to launch a satellite that can sense the Earth needs to know the \nPrinCIples Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from Space, a resolution adopted \nby the ll..N. General :Asse~bly o~ December 3, 1986. The USSR sought to prohibit \nthe ~e~smg of a natio~ WlthOU~ Its consent ~d the. developing nations sought to \nprohib~t the release of information about a nation WIthout its consent. Instead, this \n~Iution was a victory for the \"open skies\" policy of the U.S. and the space-faring \nnations. \n\n21.1 Law and Polley Considerations 833 \n\nThe key points are: \n\n\u2022 It is a resolution, not a treaty, but as the world continues to follow its precepts \n\u00b7it will become international law through custom. \n\n\u2022 The resolution applies only to sensing ''for the pmpose of improving natural \nresource management, land use and the protection of the environment\" It does \nnot apply to applications related to national security. \n\n\u2022 Data is divided into classes: primary or raw data, processed data, and analyzed \ninformation. Primary data is the same as unenhanced data under the Land \nRemote-Sensing Commercialization Act of 1984, so it must be released to all \ncustomers at reasonable cost. Processed data and analyzed information is data \nresulting from ''value added activity\" over which a company can assert \nproperty rights and refuse its release. \n\n\u2022 The resolution states that nations will conduct remote-sensing activities with \nrespect for other nations' sovereignty, not damaging the legitimate rights and \ninterests of the sensed nation. \n\nLegal arguments may affect how a reconnaissance or imaging satellite operates. \nOriginally, in a classified memorandum, President Carter prohibited a U.S. company \nfrom disclosing remote-sensing infonnation with a resolution better than 10 m. Pres-\nident Reagan's space policy rescinded this prohibition in February 1988, because the \nUSSR was selling photographic images with 5 m resolution. France, Russia, Canada, \nChina, Japan, and India provide commercially available remote sensing imagery; \ntherefore if a nation or corporation wants to keep something secret, it had best hide it \nThe press will be the least of its worries. In my view, only cost will limit these \nactivities. \n\nSince 1982 the U.S. government policy towards remote sensing technologies has \nevolved from a very restrictive view of remote sensing as an intelligence gathering \nmethodology which was classified to a broader view which promotes privatization, \ndeclassification and commercial exploitation. Efforts to expand this industry included \nrequiring NASA to acquire remote sensing data from commercial providers. However, \nthe industry has not developed as quickly as it might have because of lengthy coordi-\nnation required by various federal agencies before a license to launch and operate a \nsatellite system is issued. Unless the Department of State yields to the Department of \nCommerce and permits a reasonably unfettered development of a U.S. industry the \nmarket will be served by foreign competitors. In order to encourage the emergence of \na competitive U.S. commercial remote sensing industry it.will be necessary for the \ngovernment to support investments in new remote sensing technologies, remove \nunnecessary restrictions on the dissemination of privately gathered data, and stream-\nline the licensing process. \n\n21.1.5 Import and Export Restrictions \n\nWe need not consider restrictions on imports into the U.S. unless a project has \nfederal funding. In that event, the Buy America Act and domestic preference provi-\nsions in various other acts and regulations could affect. purcbases. In the past, an \nexploding number of statutes and regulations direct federal agencies to give domestic \nsources absolute or qualified preferences when they procure goods and services. These \nprovisions, with exceptions and qualifications, appear in trade legislation, appropria-\n\n\n\n834 Limits on Mission Design 21.1 \n\ntion statutes, procurement laws and regulations, Executive Orders, treaties, and \nMemoranda of Understanding with foreign governments. \n~ general, the Buy America Act prohibits buying foreign goods rather than \n\nsemces, but NASA has held that a supplier of space services may not use foreign \ngoods to provide the service. Under this Act, a product is notforeign if more than 50% \ncomes from domestic sources, and the DoD may buy from NATO countries. The Act's \nprovisions and rules will give American mission planners headaches and keep many \ncontracting officers and lawyers fully employed. \n\nThree mechanisms control exports from the U.S. FIrSt, commodities and technical \ndata on the commodities control list fall under the licensing requirement of the Export \n:\"-~nistration ~ct of 1979. The Commerce Department's Office of Export Admin-\nIstration runs this program and has published a series of detailed regulations. An \nexample of this process in the space sector was the approval for Payload Systems, Inc. \nto fly a crystal-growth experiment aboard the MIR space station. \n\nThe second control applies when a patent involves military technology. The \nDepartments of Defense and Energy review the export application, and either depart-\nment may classify the information to keep it secret, thus preventing export. \n\nThe third restriction stems from the Arms Export Control Act The Office of \nMunitions Control under the Department of State determines along with other Federal \nagencies what items fall under the Act's licensing provisions. This office has consid-\nerable discretion in determining whether a license should be issued. As a result, the \nUnited States Munitions List once included satellites and computer programs and \nmany other items not traditionally thought of as weapons. . \n\nThe International Traffic in Arms Regulations implement the Arms Export Control \nAct ~e Munitio~ List specifically includes rockets, spacecraft, space electronics, \nand gwdance eqwpment Defense services are also included, defined as furnishing \nhelp to fon:igners \"in the design, engineering, developmen~ production, processing, \nmanufacturing, use, operations, overhaul, repair, maintenance, modification or recon-\nstruction of articles.\" Included is the furnishing to foreigners any technical data \nwhether in the U.S. or abroad. Fmally, no one may provide foreigners technical data, \nmeaning information classified or even related to defense articles. \n\nUnder these regulations, an export does not have to cross a border. For example, an \nexport occurs when an individual discloses technical data concerning a spacecraft or \nrocket, even if the disclosure is part of a potential sale and within the U.S. These rules \ndo not apply to NATO members, Australia, New Zealand, or Japan, but they still pose \nsignificant hurdles if we are seeking a world market An example of this was the \napplication to the Department of State by United Technologies Corporation to assist \nthe Cape York Space Agency in developing a launch complex in Australia for the \nSoviet Zenit Launch Vehicle. \n\n21.1.6 Environmental Concerns \n\n!he National Environmental Policy Act and its implementing regulations call for \nrevIew of the Federal Government's actions to determine their effect on the environ-\nment Major actions involve substantial time, money, and resources. They affect large \nareas or act strongly on small areas. Recommendations on these actions must consider \ntheir effects with special care. \n\nWhen an action occurs in the U.S., we must take into account social economic and \nother environments. When it occurs outside the U.S., the req~ments ~w. \nWhether environmental protection extends to activities in outer space depends on how \n\n21.1 Law and Polley Considerations \n83S \n\nwe interpret the concept of global commons. In international law, \"global commons\" \nincludes those territories outside the jurisdiction of any nation, such as the high seas, \nthe upper atmosphere, the oceans, Antarctica, and particularly, outer space. Official \nU.S. documents which discuss \"global commons\" have not specifically mentioned \nouter space. \n\nWhether the National Environmental Policy Act applies to outer space is not \nentirely clear, but the U.S. still has obligations under Article IX of the Outer Space \nTreaty which provides for international protection of the outer--space environment \nThus, we must comply with either the letter of the Act's provisions or their essence_If \na proposed mission \"has been done before,\" environmental questio~ may quickly be \nresolved. But if it includes something new, we may wait some time for approval, \ndepending on how strongly the mission affects outer space or, especially, any celestial \nbody. . \n\nFor a government mission, the responsible agency must analyze the enVlfOnmen1al \neffects. If more than one agency is involved, a lead agency supervises the preparatioOn \nof the environmental documentation. For a private or commercial launch, the DOT \nwould require an environmental impact assessment under its mandate from the \nCommercial Launch Act \n\nUnder the National Environmental Policy Act, we must complete either an en-\nvironmental assessment or an environmental impact statement An assessment helps \ndetermine whether we need an impact statement for a particular action. It must include \nenough information to determine whether the proposed action is major and whether it \nsignificantly harms the environment of the \"global commons.\" We must assess the \nenvironmental effects and the need for the proposed action plus available alternatives. \nUnless security restrictions intervene, the assessment is available to the public l1p'OJl \nrequest. There is no need to obtain public comment An assessment is less formal and \nrigorous than an impact statement. Typically, it applies to: . \n\n\u2022 Spacecraft development projects in space science and in space and terrestrial \napplications \n\n\u2022 Specific experimental projects in space and energy technology \n\n\u2022 Development and operations of new space transportation systems \n\n\u2022 Advanced development of new space transportation and spacecraft systems \n\nIn contrast, we would need to ftle an impact statement when an action is \"expected \nto have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment\" Our draft state-\nment should be thorough enough to permit analysis and comment If it is complete \nenough after agency review, it goes to the public for comment At this time, the \nDepartment of State, the Council on Environmental Quality, and other federal \nagencies also have the chance to comment For the\u00b7 propo~ action and reasonable \nalternatives, the environmental impact statement: (1) conSIders purpose and ~eed; \n(2) provides a detailed description; (3) analyzes the environmental effects; (4) briefly \ndescribes the affected environment of the \"global commons\"; and (5) compares the \nalternatives' effects on the \"global commons.\" \n\nIf we do not know something because it is unavailable or scientifically uncertain, \nwe must .say so in the impact statement. Public hearings are not required, but may be \nappropriate, depending on circumstances. After agencies and the public have c(}m-\nmented, we redo the statement, further analyzing any issues they have raised. Then we \n\n\n\n836 Limits on Mission Design 21.1 \n\npublish it in the Federal Register before forwarding it to the decision maker for final \naction. \n\nNormally, we would need an impact statement for R&D activities associated with \ndeveloping and operating new launch vehicles, space vehicles likely to release large \namounts of foreign materials into the Earth's atmosphere or into space, and certain \nsystems for nuclear propulsion and generating power. Some listed exclusions do not \nrequire a statement, but we probably will have to do an assessment if any \"significant \nenvironmental effects\" are possible. Unless the project has been done before, we can \nexpect a bureaucrat to require an assessment of environmental effects, so he or she can \ndetermine if an assessment is required! The first assessment should determine what is \nrequired: (1) no environmental assessment; (2) only an environmental assessment; or \n(3) an environmental impact st;ltement. Although it is difficult to predict exactly how \nlong this process will take, we should anticipate 3 to 6 months for a simple assessment, \none to 2 years for a simple impact statement, and up to 5 years for international con-\ncerns or a suit in federal court. \n\nIn some cases, the action may affect the environment of a foreign nation or a \nresource designated as one of global importance. If so, we would use slightly different \nprocedures. First, we would prepare an environmental surveyor review. An environ-\nmental survey is a cooperative action and may be bilateral or multilateral. Whether or \nnot we do a review depends on consultations which determine if the proposed action \nwould do significant harm. The content is flexible, but generally includes (1) a review \nof the affected environment, (2) the predicted environmental effects, and (3) signif-\nicant known actions that governmental entities are taking to protect or improve the \nenvironment against the proposed action. If the government is not acting, is this inac-\ntivity an oversight or a conscious decision? \n\nThe U.S. prepares an environmental review unilaterally. In effect, it is an internal \naction, by which one or more governmental agencies surveys the important environ-\nmental issues associated with the proposed action. It contains essentially the same \ninformation as an environmental survey. \n\nlAsers and Particle Beams \nLasers and particle beams illuminating into space have caused almost no problems. \n\nThe reason is fairly straightforward: in the U.S., such experiments are carried out by \ngovernment laboratories or under government control. They have agreements with \nNORADIUSSPACECOM to search the space catalog and provide windows of oppor-\ntunity, so illuminating does not interfere with operational spacecraft. \n\nNuclear Power Sources \nNuclear power sources have raised questions since they were first used. The U.S. \n\nprogram began using a radioisotope thermoelectric generator with SNAP-3A in the \nsummer of 1961 and continued to 1977. In April 1965, SNAP 10 was the only U.S. \nspace nuclear reactor. The U.S. safety program includes an Interagency Nuclear Safety \nReview Panel composed of three coordinators appointed by the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Administrator of NASA. and the Secretary of Energy. The Nuclear Regulatory \nAgency, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Oceanic and Atmo-\nspheric Administration also participate in these reviews. The safety review ascertains \nwhether the benefits of using nuclear power are worth the risks. The policy of the U.S. \nin using radioisotope thermoelectric generators following an aborted SNAP-A mission \nin April 1964 was to design the container so that all nuclear material would survive \nintact, regardless of the nature of the accident. The policy makers specifically envi-\n\n21.1 Law and Polley Considerations 837 \n\nsioned reentry and impact on earth. On May 18, 1968, the range safety officer aborted \nthe launch ofNIMBUS-81 at an altitude of 30 kIn over the Santa Barbara Channel. The \ngenerator capsules were recovered without incident..Those w~ launched SN~ 10~ \nwith a nuclear reactor in 1965 launched the reactor m a subcrittcal mode, desIgned It \nto remain subcritical at or after impact should it reenter the atmosphere before start-\nup, and delayed its start-up until it had reached or?i~ It is in ~ almost circular polar \norbit, which bas a decay life of 4,000 years. Addittonally, this reactor package was \ndesigned to come apart on reentry. \n\nDesign for safety must include both system and ~ssion desi~. ~e m~~ods to \nreduce risks from nuclear materials include contaiDlDg them WIthin radioISOtope \nthermoelectric generators, diluting and dispersing them with reactors, delaying their \neffects by boosting them into a higher orbit, and possibly retrieving them using a \nvehicle like the Shuttle. \n\nOn the international front, the untimely reentry of Cosmos 954 in 1978 (see \nSec 21.1.3) caused great concern around the world and has been the subject of '!is-\ncussion in the U.N. Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. A working \ngroup's February 1981 report on Cosmos 954 reaffirmed ~at nuclear power is safe in \nouter space if it meets safety requirements. Some people sttll suggest ~ ban on nuclear \npower, and Australia has specified solar rather than nuclear power m a request for \nproposals for surveillance satellites. \n\nOnly the former USSR routinely used nuclear power to.run i~ Ra~ ~ \nReconnaissance Satellites (RORSATs).1n the future, other nattons will conSIder this \npower source to serve particular needs. For example, the U.S. had under .discussion \npowerful reactors to provide power to space components of the StrategIC Defense \nInitiative (SDI). The SP100s would generate 100 kW, some 25 times more powerful \nthan the RORSATs. These developments pose two risks: return to Earth with much \nmore fissionable material than on RORSATs and increases in radiation from gamma \nrays and positrons. The positrons from the reactor temporarily form an artificial \nradiation belt in the Earth's magnetic field. When they strike another spacecraft, the \npositrons produCe penetrative gamma-rays. This radiation interferes with astrono-\nmers' readings of natural radiation from such phenomena as solar flares, neutron stars, \nand black holes. \n\nIn the late 19808 such radiation from Soviet spacecraft occasionally overloaded the \ngamma-ray spectr~meter on board the U.S. Solar Maximum Mission satellite. The \nJapanese X-ray satellite, GINGA, also suffered. and the U.S. Gamma-Ray Observa-\ntory may be affected. \n\nThus as the need for nuclear power increases, we can expect greater pressure, \nparticul~ly from the scientific and astronomical communities, to stop its use. Consid-\nering its unique abilities, I predict that nuclear power will not be banned from space, \nbut its use will be closely regulated. Unless we must use a nuclear power somce to \ncomplete a mission, we should select another form of power. \n\nSpace Debris \nSpace debris is the other significant en~~ntal issue. It affects missi~ \n\ndesigners in two ways. FIrst, we must plan ~e m1SSIO~ to prevent or ab~te space d~~s \nas much as possible. Second, we must desIgn satellItes to meet the .nsk o~ colli~lon \nwith debris. Aside from a few cries in the wilderness, space debris receIved little \nofficial notice until the late 19808. Johnson and McKnight [1991] provide an extended \ntechnical discussion of this problem, and Reijnen and de Graff [1990] provide a \ndiscussion from a legal perspective. \n\n-\n\n\n\nI' \nI \n\n838 Limits on Mission Design 21.1 \n\nIn 1986, the U.S. Air Force Science Advisory board questioned its 1983 position \nthat debris did not appear to be a problem. As a result, the DoD established in March \n1987 a spac~ debris policy. It states in part that the \"design and operation of DoD space \ntests, expenments, and systems will strive to minimize or reduce accumulation of \nspace debris consistent with mission requirements.\" \n\nIn a final s~tement on space policy, released in February 1988, President Reagan \ncall~ for a reView of the U.S. policy on space debris. As a result, a Report on Orbital \nDebns by!he Inter~gency Group (Space) was released in February 1989. It reflected \n!h~ Group s uncertainty as to the urgency for action. Its major recommendation was a \nJo1Ot stu~y ~y NASA and DoD that would develop a con;tprehensive plan to improve \n!he n,tomtonng ?~ debris, so debris predictions could be more accurate. The report \nI?entifies two cntical areas in space for the near tenn. Low-Earth orbit requires atten-\ntion ~ause of the large masses of material and the high relative velocities. At the . \nsame ~, th~ geosynchronous arc requires attention because of the number of space-\ncraft which Wllliose their maneuvering ability within the next few years. The report \nthen echoes the DoD policy on managing debris. \n\nThis report stands in contrast with the report of the ESA's Space Debris Working \nGro~p, .dated November~ 1988. The Director General observed that clearly the present \nd~b~s 10 the space enVIrOnment poses little threat to either manned or unmanned \nmISSIO~S. ,!l0wever, \"w~ must adopt a conscious policy aimed at curbing the growth \nof debns. ~e report lIsts the same two areas of concern- low-Earth and geosyn-\nchrono~ . orblts-and notes another concern for astronomical observers. It concludes \nby ~wnng pre~e?ti~~ meas~: observing and analyzing present debris, avoiding \nColliSions, and mIDlID1Z1ng colliSion effects and future space debris. It asks nations to \nreduce the number of pieces and the mass of space debris. \n\nStrikingly~ th~ ESA's ~is a ~ ~o ~on. The agency is urged to start taking \nsteps--orgaruzational, technical, and mstitutionaJ.---to seek cooperation with others and \nthereby counter the threat to space flight Why then does the U.S. simply want to study \nthe ~tter fnrth.er? ~e answer is both political and economic. Politically, the U.S. has \nhad. difficulty discuss10g technical issues with developing nations in the U.N. Time and \nag~ the !l.S. has .been outvoted on philosophical grounds and is not ready to hear \npolitical dialogues 10 the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. The U.S. \ntherefore, looks to multilateral discussions with space-faring nations to solve problems: \n\nThe economic issue is equally sensitive. The U.S. is a space-faring nation which \nplays a majo~ 1l?le in launching its own satellites and those of its western partners into \nspace. Thus, It IS loath. to set a policy \"prematurely\" which could cost a lot of money \nto solve the space debns problem. The key words in the U.S. report are \"where feasible \nand ~ost-effective.\" The U.S. recognizes that the problem demands multinational \nsolutions but wants to avoid expensive \"political solutions.\" \n\nAdvice: stay out of the politics if at all possible. Choose a launch vehicle that is at \nleast. no worse than average in terms of causing debris and plan the mission with space \ndebris abatement. f~tures. IT you minimize debris, you will get much faster approval \nfor your space mISSIOn. \n\n21.1.7 FireSat LegaI and Polley Issues \n\nAt. ~t blush it would seem that there could be no issues at all. However, the first \nq~estion IS w~ether FrreSat is going to be a U.S. Government project or a project with \npnvate financmg .. \n\n21.1 Law and Pollcy Considerations 839 \n\nIT this is a government project the mission plamJer needs to evaluate whether the \nDepartment of Agriculture or U.S. Forest Service is going to support funding or at-\ntempt to sabotage the project Will they see it as a boon to their fire fighting mission \nor a threat, because there will be less need for fire fighting equipment andopersonnel, \nwhich will jeopardize Congressional funding? What agency will be responsible for the \nproject after it is launched? Will their staffing and funding be increased to cover addi-\ntional responsibilities? What international agreements cover firefighting support? Will \nforeign nations have a right to the information from FrreSat? Does the U.S. face any \nliability from the release of the information on fires? In other words, would there be \nliability if FrreSat did not report a fire? Under the U.N. Principles on Remote Sensing \nthe U.S. is obligated to provide data to all nations at cost. Will the data supplied be raw \ndata or enhanced data? Who will supply the equipment to analyze the data? Will the \nFtreSat mission as planned support all requests for information? What infrastructure \nwill be necessary to support the U.S.'s treaty obligations? Who will pay for it? \n\nFrom a mission perspective how many satellites will be necessary? What is the \nreplacement strategy? Who are the launch providers going to be? Can these satellites \nbe launched with other satellites (size and position questions) or do they require dedi-\ncated launches? Are there any satellites using these altitudes? What is the space debris \nsituation? Are any special shields required to protect the satellite? Do the FrreSat sen-\nsors pose any threat of interference to other satellites? Are the mission and function of \nthe FrreSat satellites in total conformity with U.S. international policy? Might not \nBrazil, for example, object to the monitoring of their forests, fearing that the U.S. was \ntrying to make a case to hold them responsible for their failure to control burning in \nthe forests? \n\nThese are examples of the kinds of questions that need to be answered. Inevitably \nthe answers cause more questions. From the limited information we have about the \nFtreSat Mission, I believe that from a legal and policy' perspective the mission is \ndoable. I am aware of the saying, \"If you cannot stand the answer do not ask the \nquestion.\" However, it is a foolish mission planner that refuses to at least know of the \nrisks. \n\n21.1.8 Asteroids \nThere has been recent interest in asteroids (Space Development Corporation) as a \n\npotential mining opportunity. Private businessmen have proposed launching missions \nto asteroids to bring back rare and precious metals. There is also interest in the Moon \nand it is said to contain aluminum, calcium, iron, silicon, and small amounts of chro-\nmium, magnesium, manganese and titanium. It also has oxygen and sulfur. Some have \nproposed to do this regardless of the legal and policy issues. The question of ownership \nof asteroids and the right to sever valuable ore is not totally clear. \n\nThe M()()n Treaty of 1979 addresses the subject of mining the Moon, asteroids and \nother celestial bodies. In general it provides for the establishment of an International \nRegime to authorize and control any mining activity at such time as the exploitation \nof natural resources becomes feasible. A critical element of the Moon Treaty is the \nprinciple of the Common Heritage of Mankind. Under this principle there is the com-\nmitment that all nations must share in the management and benefits from such activity. \nIt is this provision for sharing of benefits without contribution of investment that has \n. caused the U.S. and other space-faring nations to refrain from joining the treaty. Only \nAustralia, Austria, Chile, Mexico, Morocco, The Netherlands, Pakistan, The Pbilip-\npines and Uruguay have ratified the agreement \n\n\n\n840 Limits on Mission Design 21.2 \n\nThe argument could be made that as long as the U.S. is not a party to the treaty U.S. \ncorporations should be permitted to conduct mining operations on the theory that what \nis not prohibited is permitted. Standing alone this logic is sound, but it overlooks the \ngive and take in the international community on a vast number of issues. Many of the \ndeveloping nations firmly believe that they are entitled to share in the profits from \nspace activity and would deeply resent actions by U.S. or others from developed \ncountries \"stealing\" from them. Accordingly it is a virtual certainty that the U.S. \ngovernment would not issue a license to conduct mining activity on the Moon or other \ncelestial bodies. \n\nThe United Societies in Space has proposed a Lunar Economic Development \nAuthority and some modifications to the Moon Treaty so that mining operations could \nbe explored. Creating legal certainty will be the first step in financing such a project. \n\nThere was a similar situation with the 1982 Law of the Sea Treaty which was \nresolved in 1994 by a U.N. General Assembly resolution. The provisions were modi-\nfied to give the U.S. and other key nations a major say in the undersea mining and that \nhas facilitated exploration and the beginning of operations. This appears to be the most \nviable solution to asteroid mining, but a first priority will be reducing transportation \ncosts. \n\n21.2 Orbital Debris-A Space Hazard \n\nRonald A.

Millions of kilograms of artifi-\ncial debris orbit the Earth and present a serious concern to continued safe access to \nspace. The growth of orbital debris poses a series of difficulties for space mission \ndesigners. To control the growth of debris and its associated hazards, we should take \na number of steps during the design process. As seen in Fig. 21-2, the debris mitigation \nprocess spans all phases of the mission profile. Similarly, NASA debris mitigation \nguidelines cover all aspects of the mission design process. These guidelines can be \nfound in NASA Safety Standard 1740.14 [1995], while software to parallel the safety \nstandard is also available from NASA. \n\n21.2.1 Environmental Definition \n\nMeteoroids have been a concern since the beginning of human spaceflight \nEngineers performed a tremendous amount of work to understand the hazard posed to \nspacecraft by meteoroids. While meteoroid-effect studies and model improvements \ncontinue, researchers have understood the meteoroid background flux fairly well since \nthe late 19608. One meteoroid flux model is represented in Fig. 21-1.

There were no significant anomalies associated with the 1998 Leonids. \n\nWe define debris as any norioperational manmade object in space. These objects \ninclude nonfunctioning payloads, used rocket bodies, mission-related debris (e.g., lens \ncovers or separation devices), debris from surface degradation (e.g., insulation or paint \nchips), and debris from on-orbit fragmentation. This derelict hardware accounts for \n93% of the cataloged objects in orbit; only 7% are active payloads. Table 21-1 shows \nthe breakdown of cataloged objects [Johnson et al., 2002]. Table 21-2 shows causes \nfor these on-orbit fragmentation events. Debris from the more than 175 fragmentation \nevents are by far the largest source of orbital debris. \n\nTABLE 21-1.

This worldwide network of \nradar and optical facilities senses, tracks, identifies, and catalogs data on over 8,500 \nlarge orbiting objects. It senses objects with diameters as small as 10 em in LEO and \n1 m in GEO. This detection limit is due to the original design of the system for tracking \nlarge objects-debris detection was never envisioned as a task for the network. We \nknow that there exists a much larger population of smaller objects. This has been con\u00b7 \nfirmed by recent campaigns with more sensitive radars. Figure 21-1 shows that there \nare approximately an order of magnitude more objects in the 1 em size than exists in \nthe catalog. The 1 em size is significant because it is the largest size fragment that we \ncan effectively shield against Thus, there are a significant number of objects that we \ncannot track, but which can cause substantial spacecraft damage. \n\nWe can quantify how crowded space has become by using the spatial density, i.e., \nthe number of objects per volume of space. Figure 21-3 plots spatial density values out \n\n\u2022 Editor's Note: The Leonids are remnants of Comet 55PfI'empel-Tuttle. They are in a retro-\ngrade orbit and collide with the Earth nearly head-on such that their velocity adds to the \nEarth's orbital velocity of about 30 kmls. \n\n21.2 Orbital Debris-A Sp;u:e Hazard 843 \n\nto 2,000 km altitude for cataloged objects of various sizes. The GEO curve represents \nthe spatial density within 1 deg of the equatorial plane. The average density between \n800 and 1,000 km is just above 1(r8 km-3\u2022 The smallest trackable objects may weigh \ntens to hundreds of grams. We cannot shield against objects of this size. In GEO the \naverage spatial density is one to two orders of magnitude less than LEO. The average \nrelative velocity in LEO between orbiting objects is 9. to 10 km/s with maximum \nvalues above 14 kmls due to eccentric and retrograde orbits. In comparison. the rela-\ntive velocity between debris and satellites in GEO ranges between 100 and 500 mls. \nThe difference in relative velocities is due mainly to the lower orbital velocities and \nsmaller inclination distribution of objects in GEO. This physical phenomenon couples \nwith the lower spatial density values in GEO to make the collision hazard much \nsmaller in GEO than LEO. \n\n1W7 r----.----,----.----.-----.----.----,----.----. \n\nAD ca1aIog (May 1998) (highest line) \n\n- I '_,_ \nCaIaIog objec1s > 0.5 m d1ameter (May 1998) (lower dashed line) \n\nL __ _ \n\n400 800 800 1.000 1,200 1,400 1,600 1,800 2,000 \nA1tItuda(km) \n\n1~r-----_.-----,,_----.------,----~~----_, \n\nNOTE: GEO da1a Is fOr \u00b1 1 degree latitude \n\nRg.21-3.

See text for discussion. \n\nIn addition to the spatial density being different in LEO vs. GEO. the natural \ncleansing effects also differ. In GEO and geosynchronous transfer o~it the majo.r Jl.ef-\nturbations are solarlIunar gravitational effects. For very small debris, solar radiation \npressure may also significantly affect lifetimes. how~ver, atmospheric ~ at ~O \nhas no measurable influence. Hence, a major breakup m geosynchronous orbIt will af-\nfect all future operations in. that regime. On the other hand, atmospheric drag greatly \naffects the lifetimes of objects in LEO. The smaller debris fragments have signifieant-\nly larger area to mass ratios and thus drag affects them more. This natural removal of \n\n\n\n844 Limits on Mission Design 21.2 \n\norbital debris is very important in the long-term definition of the environment. We \nhave sensed decreases in the cataloged population only during periods of maximum \nsolar activity (1979-80 and 1988-90). However, in the 2000-2001 period of high solar \nactivity the overall cataloged population stayed fairly constant due to several signifi-\ncant breakup events. \n\nThe other major variables in debris growth are the number and types of satellite \nfragmentation events. As the debris population grows, the environment may become \nso severe that satellite or object fragmentations due to hypervelocity collisions with \ndebris may occur [Kessler and Cour-Palais, 1978]. This type of event will mark a clear \ntrend toward a worsening environment. The first confirmed collision between cata-\nloged objects occurred in July 1996. The altitude of a breakup will foretell the effect \non the long-term debris environment. Breakups below 500 km may have a major \ninfluence for less than a decade while fragmentations above 500 km may pose large \nhazards for many decades. Presently, there is no cost-effective method of removing \ndebris already in orbit. The prudent design of future spacecraft will lessen the chance \nof debris generation and satellite fragmentation. \n\nIt is difficult to describe precisely the present status of the dynamic near-Earth \ndebris environment, much less to accurately predict the future debris environment, due \nto uncertainties in traffic models and fragmentation rates. The trackable population \ngrew at a nearly linear rate from 1960 to 1990. We don't know exactly how the \nundetectable population grew, but it is more strongly influenced by the fragmentation-\nevent rate, satellite operational patterns, and the solar cycle [Johnson and McKnight, \n1991]. Predictions of the actual number and flux of all debris rely on accurate model-\ning of its sources and sinks. We compare debris models with our best measurements \nof the environment: impact rates on returned spacecraft surfaces for very small debris \nand special radar measurements for detectable objects. We continually improve and \nupdate these models as our understanding of the debris environment grows. Spacecraft \ndesigners can look for the latest environmental models .through one of the NASA, \nDoD, ESA, or other international space agency Space Debris program offices. \n\n21.2.2 Design Considerations: Spacecraft Hazard and Survivability Analysis \n\nMission designers must address two main issues concerning space debris. First, we \nneed to design debris protection for large, long-lived spacecraft to ensure mission suc-\ncess. Second, we must use debris mitigation methods to ensure that space activities \nwill not continue to litter our near-Earth environment with more derelict hardware \n[NSS 1740.14, 1995]. \n\nWe can approximate the probability, Pc, of a piece of debris impacting a space \nsystem using the kinetic theory of gases: \n\nPc = l_e(-SPD\u00b7AC\u00b7T\u00b7VREL) (21-1) \n\nwhere SPD is the spatial density of debris objects (i.e., average number of objects per \nvolume in space), AC is the collision cross-sectional area, T is the mission duration, \nand VREL is the relative velocity between the satellite and debris population. Using \nthis simple equation, the rough order of magnitude approximation for collision \nprobability for one year in orbit for a range of altitudes and satellite sizes is listed. in \nTable 21-3. These values are approximate and only show the order of magnitude for \nthe probability of collision. Detailed analysis should use a more accurate debris envi-\nronment model [for example, Klinkrad et aI., 1997 or Liou et al., 2002], as well as a \n\n21.2 Orbital Debris-A Space Hazard 845 \n\nmore refined representation of the spacecraft's cross-sectional area. Also space \nsatellite designers must take the meteoroid en~nment. into account. Meteoroi~ \ndominate the hazard for sub-millimeter up to IDllhmeter SIZe, and can penetrate thin \nhoneycomb structures. \n\nTABLE 21-3. Collision Probability per Year (In 1999). The table values are approximated over \nall inclinations for a cross-sectional area range of 5 to 40 m2. The cross-sectional \narea Is defined as the area viewed from one orientation, and is approximately 1/4 \nof the total surface area for simple convex shapes. . \n\nCollision Probability per Year \n\nAltitude \n1 em diameter 1 mm diameter (km) Traekable \n\n300 1Q-6-1Q-5 1()-4-10-3 10-2-10-\n1 \n\n400 1 Q-5-1 0-4 1()-4-10-3 10-\n1-1 \n\n500 1Q-5-10-4 1()-4-10-3 10-\n1-1 \n\n600 1Q-5-10-3 1 ()-4-10-2 10-\n1-1 \n\n800 1 ()-4-1 0-3 1Q-3-10-\n2 10-1-1 \n\n1,000 10-4-10-3 10-3-10-\n2 10-1-1 \n\n1,200 10-4-10-3 10-3-10-\n2 10-1-1 \n\n1,500 1Q-5-10-3 1 Q-3-1 0-\n2 10-1-1 \n\n2,000 1Q-6-1Q-5 1 Q-5-1 0-3 10-2-10-\n1 \n\nThe cataloged population presents a manageabl~ deb?s hazard to even large \nspacecraft. However, incorporation of nontrackable objects tnt? the hazard assessment \nproduces much larger probabilities of collision. The flux rate Increases several or~ers \nof magnitude for untrackable debris that can still cause dama~e. An enco~nter WIth a \n1 cm fragment will likely produce significant amounts of de~ns, muc~ of It trackable, \nwhile a 1 mm impact most likely will cause surface degradation, localized craters and \nsmall penetrations. . \n\nFor GEO satellites, we may use alternate forms of probabili.ty of co~lision equa!I0ns \nwhich are more convenient due to the physically and dynamically ~Ifferent ~?vlTOn\u00ad\nment [Johnson and McKnight, 1991]. The obj~ts ~ave l?~er orbital velOCItIes and \nmost reside in a narrow latitudinal band resulting In a distinct contrast to the more \nrandomly distributed LEO environment. The hazard in GEO appears to be about a \ndecade behind LEO, but the GEO population will grow quickly because there are \nfewer natural sinks. . . \n\nWhile we can determine the expected rate of ll?pact for ~ertain s~ed m~teorOids \nand debris relatively easily with one of the avaIlable OT?ltaI debris env~?IDent \nmodels. determining the hazard to a spacecraft is not as straIghtforward. Christiansen \net aI. [1992] outline this process as: \n\n1. Determine failure or damage conditions for the mission \n\n2. Determine impact conditions causing failure or damage \n\n3. Determine likelihood offailure (integrating the step 2 equatio~ over.the flux, \ndirection, velocity, and projectile characteristics from debris envlTonment \n\nmodels) \n\n\n\nLimits on Mission Design 21.2 \n\n4. Assess sufficiency of the design \n\n5. Modify the design or requirements, if needed \n\nDue to the dynamic nature of the debris environment, the best strategy is to inte-\n?I\"ate d~bris awareness into all phases of the design process. However, it will be \nIncreasIngly expensive to actually implement any system changes the later in the \ndesign process. Special attention to the protection of mission critical systems may stiD \nbe considered late in the design process. \n\nThe first step mentioned above entails determining what constitutes a failure or \nunacceptable mission degradation. This is something each spacecraft may define dif-\nferently and will influence the hazard assessment. For the International Space Station \nloss of a module or loss of life may be the unacceptable damage level, while for ~ \nunmanned spacecraft it may be loss of any critical system, such as attitude control. \n\nThe second step depends on the many unknowns of the projectile and the spacecraft \nstructures. In order to proceed with the hazard analysis, we must derive some kind of \nequatio~ rela~ng damage to projectile characteristics. For pressure vessels, where \npenetration WIll have serious implications, a ballistic limit equation is determined \nwhich relates the projectile characteristics to the penetration ability for a specific \nspacecraft wall. Researchers have determined equations for single walled spacecraft \nand multilayered shielding configurations [Hayashida and Robinson 1991\u00b7 Chris-\ntiansen et al., 1995; Christiansen, 1993]. Armed with the performanc~ equations for \nthe spacecraft surfaces, we can determine a probability of failure by integrating over \nall the ~x~ted projectiles from the debris models (step 3 above). The next step is to \ndetenmne If the probability of success is sufficient for the mission; If the probability \nof sD:ccess is not sufficient, then we need further protective measures or design modi-\nfications. The RADARSAT mission is an example of a spacecraft that did not have an \nacceptable level of risk after the preliminary design. Approximately 17 kg of shielding \nwas added to reach a comfortable level [Warren and Yelle, 1994]. \n\nDebris Protection \n\n~e o~ ~escribe the expected damage of a debris impact, to first order, by the \nrelative kInetic energy of the impacting object. For a relative impact velocity of 10 \nkmIs, a 100 g fragment (6-10 em diameter) possesses the kinetic energy equivalent to \n1 kg of TNT. On the smaller end of the scale, a 1.6 mm debris object has the same \nkinetic energy as a 9 mm pistol slug. The amount of energy absorbed by the structure \nand the level of damage is highly dependent on the impactor characteiistics, satellite \nstruc~e and .I~ation of impact. !bus: it is difficult to determine the effect of a hyper-\nvelOCIty ~~~ Impact <.>n a satelbte WIthout a considerable amount of specific satellite \nand colhslOn Information. Nevertheless, a 100 g object impacting at 10 kmIs wiIl \nprod~ce extensive damage on any satellite, and would destroy any small, compact \nsatelhte, given a center of mass collision. \n. Spa~~ win encounter micrometeoroids and orbital debris during their func-\ntion~ hfetime. However, there are passive and active means to protect them from most \ndebns .. 1'.assive ~eans include shielding and redundancy, while active generally refers \nto colhslOn aVOidance. Bumper shields are effective for passive protection against \nfragments smaller than 1 em in diameter (mg range). \n\n. Fi~ 21-4 ~ualitatively shows how ~ffective shielding systems are at defeating \nan Impacting particle. The bottom curve IS for a single sheet wall, while the other \n\n21.2 Orbital Debris-A Space Hazard 847 \n\ncurves are for different shielding configurations which have the same weight as the \nsingle wall. Shielding systems have one or more outer bumpers and sometimes in-\ntermediate backup layers before the innermost wall. Bumper shielding systems work \nby fragmenting or vaporizing the projectile with the first layer when the projectile has \na very high velocity. The resulting debris cloud expands and hits the next layers over \na larger area, dispersing the energy of the projectile and the impulsive load. In the case \nof a pressure vessel, this shielding increases the probability that the pressure hull will \nsurvive impacts-without penetration, rupture or spall with a much thinner pressure \nwall. In other words, when we optimize bumper shields, the resulting two or more \nwalls weigh less ~d provide better protection from particulate impact than a single \nwall design. The bumper system has three main design parameters: \n\n1. Thickness and material of the outer wall (shield or bumper) \n\n2 .. Spacing between the shield and the backup layers \n\n3.

This figure \nqualitatively shows the penetrating diameter of an impacting projectile vs. the Impact \nvelocity for a single wall and two shielding options. The three sections of the shieldlng \ncurves correspond to projectile deformation, projectile fragmentation, and projectile \nmelt or vaporization, respectively, as the Impact velocity Increases. This assumes \nspherical aluminum projectiles. \n\nThe design of the shield depends on the shield-to-projectile mass density ratio and \nthe projectile's impact velocity. The debris environment parameters will vary by \naltitude and change over time as events alter the environment. For a given environment \nand spacecraft configuration (exposed area, structure and mission duration), we opti-\nmize the shield thickness, ts ' and wall spacing, S, to insure projectile fragmentation. \n\n\n\n848 Limits on Mission Design 21.2 \n\nThis highlights the main function of the shield: to break apart the impacting object so \nthat its debris will hit the backup layer(s) over a larger area. causing less damage, \n\nThe ability of the shield to lessen the effect of the projectile's impact is directly \nproportional to the shield's ability to break it apart The optimum situation occurs when \nthe shield and projectile fragments vaporize or liquefy, In this state they present less \nhazard to the backup layer(s), Testing by NASA has shown that the ratio Vd, where d \nis the impacting particle's length, is around 0,1 to 0.2 for a functional shield [Cour-\nPalais, 1979]. This range is good for aluminum-on-aluminum impacts in the velocity \nrange 5-12 kmls. We obtain more beneficial effects if the shield has a low melt-\ning point and high mass density, both of which will produce more damage to the \nprojectile and a lower probability of solid particles striking the backup sheet [Cour-\nPalais, 1979]. \n\nThe equation for determining the \"optimum\" backup sheet thickness, tb' assumes \nthat shield and projectile debris are mostly in molten or vaporized states. For a basic \nform of aluminum (7075-T6), the equation for the condition where the backup sheet \nwill not deflect, rupture, or spall is given by Cour-Palais [1979]: \n\n(21-2) \n\nwhere tb is the backup sheet thickness in em, m is the projectile mass in g, v is the \nprojectile velocity in kmls, S is the spacing in cm, and an empirically derived constant \nC = 41.5 \u00b114.0 (em3g-lkm-1s). \n\nThe optimum design of a shield depends on the physical properties of the projectile \nand its velocity. A design which works at one speed may not be as effective at other \nspeeds due to the characteristics of hypervelocity impacts. Also, the composite and \nsandwich construction methods common on many commercial spacecraft have differ-\nent properties than simple aluminum structures [Taylor et al., 1998]. System designers \nshould look for the latest references because the science and art of shielding progresses \nrapidly. \n\nStructures such as the International Space Station must have extensive shielding to \nsurvive the particle environment. Multilayered shielding will greatly reduce the prob-\nability of a penetration to the pressure hulls of the Station. Other spacecraft also have \nvulnerable systems and components that must be protected to ensure a successful \nmission. Mission critical systems and components must either have special shielding \nfrom debris, or be shielded by less critical structures. An understanding of the debris \nhazard can help spacecraft designers to minimize the cost of the spacecraft by design-\ning survival into the vehicle from the beginning. Table 21-4 lists some common sense \ndesign guidelines. \n\nDebris A voUlance \n\nSome satellites may face a significant hazard due to trackable objects. In this case, \ndesigners and operators may need to use passive and active avoidance techniques. \nPassive collision avoidance methods include minimizing the size (cross section) of the \nspacecraft, either by reducing the actual size or controlling the attitude to have a \nsmaller profile with respect to the debris impact directions. For most LEO spacecraft, \nthe normalized average relative impact rates by spacecraft surface are: 10 kmls for \nleading edge \u00b1 45\u00b0, 2 kmls for surfaces 90\u00b0 to the ram direction, 1 kmls for trailing \nedge, 0.1 kmls for space pointing, and 0.01 kmls for Earth pointing surfaces.

This reqwres active tracking of co-orblting objects, \nadditional propellant, coordination with satellite tracking facilities (such as \nUSSP ACECOM), and coordination with co-orbiting spacecraft operators. At the pres-\nent time, systems such as the International Space Station, th~ Space Shu~e, and ~O \nsatellite constellations are the only missions using or planntng to use active colhslOn \navoidance. The Shuttle has made several highly publicized maneuvers to avoid cata-\nloged objects. Active avoidance is only practical for protec~on from the. largest of \nfragments and may still be suspect since ground-based tracking accuracy IS poor for \nmost orbiting objects (unless the tracking system ~xpends extra eff~rt to update a \nspecific satellite). Thus, it is not a cost-effective option for most satellite operators at \n\nthis time. \n\nDebris Mitigation \nAll space users have a responsibility to include debris mitigation techniques in th~ir \n\nmission profiles. As identified in Fig. 21-2, there are ~ee phases where ~ c~ mm-\nimize the addition of debris to the environment. While non-governmental missIons do \nnot have any debris mitigation regulations at this time, the U.S. Government r~~ \nits missions to minimize debris [NSS 1740.14, 1995; NMI 1700.8, 1993]. Additional \nregulations and guidelines are in work by both NASA and the UN. \n\nLaunch system designers should plan their scenarios to reduce launch-rel~ \ndebris such as protective shrouds, separation devices and e~ded ~k~t bodies. \nThey should not allow this hardware to reach long-lived orbits. Histonc~y,. an \naverage of three large pieces of debris are produced from eac~ successful. JDlSSlOn. \nHowever, the launch process probably generates many more nontrackable PIeces. \n\nAs a satellite is inserted into its final orbit, we should take care not to produce \ndebris during the last impulsive maneuvers. A major source of debris in the past ~as \nexploding rocket .stages. Some of these propulsion-related .e~plosions occun:ed dunng \nattempted burns while others resulted from inadvertent lDlXlng of hypergobc fuels or \n\n.1 \n\n\n\nLimits on Mission Design \n\n~ overpressurization years after the rocket's last use. Designers corrected this \nproblem on many rocket bodies by venting the fuel or conducting an idle burn. \n\nBefore we declare a satellite operational, we must deploy its solar panels, uncover \nits instruments, and stabilize its orientation. Given the present design of satellites, all \nthese activities may release hardware into space. As a satellite operates and ages, paint \nchips off and small pieces of hardware work themselves free, creating more orbital \ndebris. \n\nOnce that satellite or rocket body ceases to perform a useful purpose, we may \nc.onsider the entire system to be debris, and we should remove it for the sake of the \nremaining operational payloads. We should add this mission termination phase to \nthe mission profile, using propulsive maneuvers to put it into a disposal orbit or re-\nentry trajectory. We use disposal orbits mostly for GEO satellites, while reentry is \nmost economical for many LEO orbits. We must consider these maneuvers in the \ndesign prOcess to control the growth of orbital debris. Regardless of our regime, all \nenergy sources should be passivated (e.g., fuel and pressure tanks vented, batteries \nsafed, and momentum wheels despun). \n\nThe design decision in response to orbital debris is basically a cost balance between \ndesign and risk costs. As discussed in Sec. 19.2, the risk cost is the expected cost of \nfailure. This value is simply the probability of a debris encounter causing a failure \ntimes the cost to compensate for this failure. This may entail accepting degraded \nperformance or launching a substitute. A, worsening debris environment may increase \nthe space segment failure probability (Sec. 19.2) which we can offset by changes in \ndesign such as shielding, redundancy, or avoidance maneuvers. Each of these counter-\nmeasures exact a financial burden of increased direct costs (design and manufacturing) \nand indirect costs (launch and maintenance), yet may result in greater reliability for all \nspace systems. \n\nReferences \n\nChristiansen, E.L. 1993.

Recently, spacecraft have become \nmore diverse. with the largest spacecraft now complimented by new systems using a \nlarger number of smaller spacecraft in low-Earth orbit. While these are lower cost than \ntheir predecessors, this chapter focuses on the lowest tier of spacecraft cost to examine \nthe particular methods and attributes characteristic of minimum-cost spacecraft. In \ncertain applications these lower cost, smaller, simpler spacecraft are more effective. \nWe will examine the tradeoffs between conventional technology and what is now \nreferred to as miniature satellite technology or micros pace. We will also consider the \nmost successful applications for minimum cost spacecraft technology, as well as how \nengineering of low-cost and miniature spacecraft differs from that of conventional \ndevices. Because modem, low-cost spacecraft design is a rapidly evolving technology, \nthere are few references. We have included an annotated bibliography as a guide to \nfurther reading. \n\nEver since Sputnik in 1957 and Explorer in 1958, spacecraft developers have built \nsmall, simple systems alongside large, conventional satellites. Miniature satellites fill \nspecific niches. especially for short-term missions with few users. A miniature satel-\nlite typically weighs less than 200 kg, has a shorter mission lifetime requirement, and \nis put together quickly by a small team. With less money invested, and because a \nminimum cost spacecraft has far fewer components and lower complexity, a user can \nsanction more liberal engineering designs and be more willing to use newer, less \nexpensive technology, such as more contemporary electronic components or fabrica-\ntion techniques. \n\nThe main advantages of miniature satellites are decreased costs and production \ntimes. Military, university, commercial, and institutional space programs sometimes \ncannot afford large, conventfonal spacecraft or take the time needed to build and \nlaunch them. \n\n853 \n\n\n\n854 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft \n\nSince they provide fewer, more modest on-orbit abilities, miniature products have \nmuch simpler system architectures. They achieve reliability through simplicity rather \nthan through expensive, redundant components. They can be much smaller and lighter \nthan conventional products, thus reducing launch costs, which typically constitute half \nthe cost of a satellite system on orbit. Very small devices can often fill small spaces \navailable on large launchers. For ground transportation, one person can often carry a \nsmall satellite in a car or on an airline seat. \n\nMilitary applications of larger spacecraft are vulnerable to failure during launch or \non orbit, as well as to aggressive acts. We currently address these weaknesses mainly \nwith redundant subsystems, highly reliable components, and defensive counter-\nmeasures, all of which add cost and size. A miniature technology approach would be \nto create many small, relatively vulnerable spacecraft, providing the same ability but \na more difficult target. \n\nSmall size is not in itself a new feature. The earliest satellites were very small out \nof necessity, weighing 5 to 50 kg. In retrospect, it is remarkable how large satellites \nhave grown, not how small a few satellites are. Table 22-1 surveys a sample of the \nsmall satellites launched from 1991 to 1995. Since 1957, larger systems, made possi-\nble by advances in the technolqgy of satellites and launch vehicles, have absorbed the \nmost engineering attention and resources. However, the continuity in their launch \ndates shows that small satellites have played a role throughout satellite history, and are \nstill useful in specific applications. \n\nTABLE 22-1.

The satellites often had lifetimes limited by on-board battery power becaUSe \nthey had no solar panels. They carried either simple analog transponders or simple \nbeacons for researching signal propagation. The Echo series were passive reflectorS \nformed of metallized polymer balloons. . \n\nVirtually all of today's satellite applications appeared in the first 10 years of \nsatellite development For example, the Telstar series first demonstrated television and \ntelephone relay. In size, mass, power, and orbit these satellites resembled today's \ntypical small satellites. They proved that satellite-linked TV was effective and \ndesirable, thus blazing the trail for the large geosynchronous communications \nsatellites in commercial and government service today. Several small Earth-\nsurveillance systems had flown by 1967. The first weather satellite, Tiros 1, flew in \n1960. VELA was one of the most successful small, Earth-observing satellites. Built by \nTRW for the Air Force and Department of Energy and weighing 152 kg, VELA sat-\nellites were the frrst to provide data from space concerning nuclear weapons testing on \nEarth. Though initially flown as an experimental satellite and developed by a small \ngroup in 18 months, VELA provided years of valuable reconnaissance service on \norbit. \n\nRadio amateurs were quick to see how they could apply satellites to communication \nand education. In 1961 the 5-kg OSCAR I (Orbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur \nRadio) Was the first of a series of satellites radio amateurs built and operated world-\nwide. Now numbering about 30 and spanning over 35 years, almost all of these \nsatellites have exceeded their operational design for on-orbit lifetime. The first com-\nmercial comsat, Early Bird, which weighed just 39 kg, was flown in 1965. \n\nContinuing Applications of Miniature Satellite Technology \nBetween 1965 and 1985, space-faring nations deemphasized small satellites in \n\nfavor of getting the most sophisticated performance from on-orbit resources. Because \nthe United States was committed to crewed flight, including the lunar landing, we \ndeveloped large boosters. Larger boosters also became available for placing large \npayloads into geosynchronous orbit, revolutionizing global communications and \ncreating the infrastructure in place today. \n\nAs space systems rapidly grew in size, vigorous small satellite programs continued \nbut without much attention from either the public or mainstream aerospace engineer-\ning. For example, several amateur radio satellites were developed using technologies \nand design approaches previously untried in spacecraft. They also continued to apply \nsimpler, less expensive devices which were rapidly vanishing as satellites became \nlarger and more complex. These small satellites employed photovoltaics to charge \nNiCd batteries for on-orbit lifetimes of several years. They carried VHF, UHF, and \nmicrowave transponders and had a range of operating modes controlled by ground \ncommand. \n\nSmall satellites often played a role behind the scenes in developing military sys-\ntems. Very small devices were routinely flown to provide on-orbit targets and signal \nsources for tracking systems. These satellites usually carried active sensors which \nsensed their RF and optical environment and relayed the data back to ground stations. \n\nMany nations have entered the space community through launches of small satel-\nlites, including Canada, France, Italy, England, Korea, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, \nUK, Israel, Spain, Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Malaysia, Denmark, Japan, Germany, \nCzechoslovakia, India, and The Netherlands. \n\n857 \n\nModem Low-Cost Systems \nBy 1985, amateur satellites such as OSCAR 10 and UoSat 2/0SCAR 11 had \n\ndemonstrated the value of reliable digital communications to small satellites .. As Tel-\nstar clearly showed, we can use a single small satellite in low-Earth orbit only when \nthe ground station can see it; its ability to communicate was limited. To overcome this \nproblem. OSCAR 10 employed digital store andforward communications. using the \nsmall satellite platform as a mailbox or bulletin board. Users anywhere on Earth could \ntranSmit prepared messages to the satellite during its brief overhead pass. !he satellite \ncould then deliver these messages throughout the world. Conseque~tly, a smgle~ small. \ninexpensive satellite in low-Earth orbit provided global mail semce-something not \neven a large geosynchronous satellite can do. \n\nThis new operating mode began at the same time that NASA extended its Get Away \nSpecial program to release small payloads into orbit NASA's pro~ had provided \ninexpensive transportation into space for small \u00ab 68 kg). self-contained payloads. \nReplacing ballast used to balance the Space Shuttle's major payloads, the program had \ncarried payloads fixed to the payload bay wall on roundtrips to orbit Goddard Space \nFlight Center developed a Get Away Special container with an opening lid and a \nspring ejection system. This allowed orbital insertion of a 68-kg satellite for less ~an \n$50K. The European Ariane rocket had independently developed the ASAP (Ariane \n. Structure for Attached Payloads). Up to 6 smaIl satellites could be carried aboard the \nASAP ring, each with mass up to 50 kg. Several Amsat and university sate~i~, as \nwell as spacecraft developed under national R&D programs for a range of applications \nhave since flown on ASAP. Due to the popularity and success of the ASAP program, \nit has been expanded for Ariane V. accommodating physically larger payloads with a \nmass of up to 100 kg. (For further details see London [1996]). . \n\nThus. small. inexpensive satellites reentered the aerospace mamstream through the \nconfluence of three developments: \n\n\u2022 Low-cost access to space \n\u2022 Highly capable digital communications systems whose weight, power, and \n\nvolume were compatible with the Get Away Special \n\n\u2022 Digital store and forward communications \n\nRadio amateurs exploited the concept of a digital mailbox in a small. low-cost \nsatellite to communicate with relief workers in remote parts of the world. The same \ntechnology was a fundamental feature of the University of Northern Utah's N~at, \nwhich was designed to calibrate FAA air traffic control radars and to be ~. educational \ntool at the University. A similar application drove the Global Low OrbJttng Message \nRelay (GLOMR) satellite's ability to carry data from remotely located sensors to a \ncentral command post \n\nThe success of these low-cost satellites caused designers to reassess the roles of \nlarge and smaIl space systems. Some payload organizations quickly reco~ that \nthe ability to fly a simple, small payload with low cost and fast turnaround was Ideally \nsuited to their needs. These first-generation users included scientific programs and \nsmaller national programs that could not justify the resources required to fly a con-\nventional technology project. Israel's Offeq satellite, launched in ~ct~. 1988, \nrepresents this facet of miniature technology. Today the s~-satelli~ mdustry fo-\ncuses on special niches to satisfy missions that conventional satellite technology \ncannot cover with larg~ spacecraft and multiple payloads. developed in programs \nspanning 5 to 15 years. \n\n\n\n858. Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.1 \n\nThe ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-Ray Imaging SenSOIS) 120 kg satellite, bUilt \nin 1989 and launched in 1993, was representative of the increasing utility afforded by \nsmall,low-cost satellites. The payload required anti-Sun orientation with a slow 2-rplll \nroll about the Sun axis. This special stabilization requirement, plus the need for obser-\nvation times of one month to one year, made this payload incompatible with larger \nspacecraft catering to multiple payloads. The ALEXIS spacecraft bus, developed for \nLos Alamos National Laboratory, weighs only 45 kg without its payload of scientific \ninstruments and costs about $3M. Yet it supplies 55 W of continuous power to the \npayload, buffers 1 Gbit of science data between downlinks to a single ground station, \nprovides all spacecraft guidance and position data, and offers telemetry down and \nuplinks at 750 and 9.6 kbitls respectively. Built for a 6-month on-orbit mission \nALEXIS has provided over 6 years of on-orbit science operations and remains in con-\ntinuous operation as ofmid-I999. \n\nChemical Release Observation canister (eRO), another advanced miniature satel-\nlite program, is a group of three small satellites, each carrying 25 kg of hydrazinic \nchemicals. Designed to eject the liquid chemical for optical observation from the \nground and from the Shuttle, the satellites provide simple telemetry of the payload \nstate (temperature and pressure) and respond to various ground commands. The satel-\nlites are aerodynamically stabilized to weathercock and fly oriented along their veloc-\nity vector. Built and flown for under $IM each, CRO was a highly successful \napplication of a minimum cost spacecraft. \n\nSince the success of the OSCAR 10 satellite in 1983, miniature technology has \nbecome an increasingly important element of hardware programs and systems archi-\ntecture studies. OSCAR 10 provided analog and digital communications from a \nMolniya orbit to amateur radio operators for about 14 years. Since 1965,OSCAR-\nseries satellites built by volunteer developers with limited budgets have demonstrated \npart of the potential of miniature satellite technology. \n\nFigure 22-1 addresses one reason\u00b7 these small systems have become so important \nThe dramatic miniaturization of the electronic components composing most satellite \npayloads implies that the spacecraft could do as much or more while becoming \nsmaller. But conventional satellites have increased their mass by three orders of mag-\nnitude despite the mass of some components shrinking by as much as four orders of \nmagnitude. Miniature satellite devices built with advanced technolOgy can do much \nmore than the very large, costly devices of only a decade ago. \n\nComputers are another instance where miniaturizing has provided highly capable, \naffordable machines. Miniaturizing has also changed the way we use these machines \nand greatly expanded their applications. The computer revolution came about because \nwe thought of how to apply new technology in new ways. The technology is in place \nto create a new class of small, inexpensive, and highly capable space systems. Our \nchallenge is to identify how to apply these new methods and products. \n\n22.1 Designing Low-Cost Space Systems \n\nAlthough we can design for low cost in different ways, some general rules apply \nbased on space-system development, launch, and operations costs. Launch costs are \noften quoted simply as a linear function of mass on orbit for various orbit classes. This \nsimple model implies that achieving very low mass automatically minimizes launch \ncosts. But achieving low mass at low cost requires minimizing payload requirements, \nredundancy, and size.

Teams suffer if they lose a key person. This vul-\nnerability can be even higher in small teams because every team member is essential. \nManagers of small programs need to ensure that each member works with a ''buddy'' \nwho, though the buddy may be focused on another aspect of the program, understands \nto some extent what the engineer is doing. In the event of loss of that engineer from \nthe program. the buddy can take on his or her tasks and responsibilities while the team \nredistributes work. \n\nA small organization trades resources freely across disciplinary boundaries. No \nteam member takes any resource for granted or \"owns\" an allocation. The program \nmanager communicates concerns about cost throughout the group. The efficiency \npossible in a small group is so valuable that the individuals often work much harder \nrather than bring more communications and management burdens to the program. The \nspacecraft team can carefully explore and negotiate every systems-level requirement \nwith the users in order to show them how to save money. fleXibility on both sides can \ncut costs dramatically. A small program should plan to invest in automated design and \nanalysis tools. These tools reduce team labor hours, but more importantly they help to \nget the job done without team size inflating beyond the size (about 20 people) which \nallows close team interactions. Similarly the project should plan to subcontract \nspecialized functions to keep the team as small, focused and interactive as possible. \n\nA satellite program expends much of its resources on the ground station which may \noperate two or three times longer than the satellite development program and require \nexpensive full-time staffing. To avoid the capital and maintenance costs for a large \nground station, it is best located at the user's site-preferably in the user's office. \nSmall satellites can be simple enough to be built around the user's personal computer \nand operated as a computer -controlled. laboratory apparatus. \n\nTechnologies employed in the ground station include computing systems from the \nconsumer market. such as a PC-based station controller, read-write optical disc \narchiving, and commercial input-output cards. Because antenna costs increase rapidly \nwith gain, we engineer the link based on the best antenna gain achievable at low cost. \nSophisticated ground-station software eliminates most of the need for operator inter-\naction and provides a simple, user-friendly interface requiring little special training. \nThe computer is the only interface to the ground-station equipment. so the user need \nnot understand any other equipment interfaces. \n\nThe program review used to develop conventional satellites is inappropriate for \nminiature satellites. For conventional program reviews, one person represents each \ndepartment while other members keep working. But for the smaIl satellite team, a \ndepartment\" may be one person. Thus, for best efficiency, teleconferences and \nsmaller, less frequent Technical Interchange Meetings replace conventional reviews. \nUsually, the members directly involved in a given issue meet; rarely does the whole \ngroup need to attend. \n\nProgram costs depend on schedule about equally in large or smaIl efforts. But \nbecause miniature satellite programs are short. delaying a few months can increase \ncost significantly with respect to the total development budget Therefore program \nmanagers must take the schedule seriously, always looking for means to finish and \nlaunch the spacecraft as quickly as possible. \n\nLike program management. quality assurance is a subfunction carried out within \nthe team developing a miniature satellite. No single individual or discrete organization \nhandles it The team works case-by-case in deciding on fabrication standards, compo-\n\n\n\n862 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.1 \n\nnent qualification, or requirements for derating and previous flight experience. The \nsame is true for applying specific fabrication standards orfor inspections. This method \nallows the system engineer to reduce or eliminate quality requirements if their cost \noutweighs their contribution to the probability of success. \n\nAn example of selectively applying quality assurance standards is in the design of \na spacecraft mass memory, which contains single controller and input-output (I/O) \ndevices managing a large number of mass storage devices. Failure of one of the control \nor YO devices is catastrophic. Because there are few of these devices, We can justify \nspecifying highly reliable, highest-grade (and hence high cost) components. On the \nother hand, failure of one or even several of the many memory components is not par-\nticularly serious. Further, procuring many of these devices at very high standards is \nexpensive. Thus, we procure memory for much less money at lower standards of qual-\nity and reliability. \n\nOccasionally, a key component not previously used in spacecraft may improve per-\nformance or save money. With lower reliability requirements and the flexibility to \nconsider parts individually, we can decide whether to apply the component, based on \nthe following: \n\n\u2022 Whether its failure brings catastrophe or merely degrades operation \n\n\u2022 How well we can simulate its space operation \n\n\u2022 How much not using the component would cost in performance and resources \n\n\u2022 Whether we can meet system reliability goals with it \n\nSaving money in testing does not necessarily imply higher risk of on-orbit failure. \nHere again the simplicity of miniature technology allows a different, more individual \napproach. The program manager may opt to eliminate subsystem and component tests \nin favor of a full system-level qualification. This decision does not reduce probability \nof mission success. In fact, simulating the space environment achieved in testing may \nbe more accurate for the integrated system test approach because each part will be \nqualified while operating with actual flight interfaces. The tradeoff is in program risk \nvs. program cost. If many component or subsystem flaws exist, they are more easily \ncorrected at the subsystem test level. On the other hand, if few failures occur, we \nshould rely on the integrated system test, which eliminates long testing of subsystems \nand components. \n\nMiniature satellite testing should take advantage of the system's simplicity. Wher-\never possible, we should use the actual flight and ground hardware for all tests, thus \nraising confidence that all system elements will acl!Jally work together in flight while \nlowering investment in simulations, test fixtures, and facilities. \n\nEvery mission develops with overt or subtle political pressure to satisfy the widest \npossible constituency. Conventional products typically carry a number of discrete, \noften unrelated payloads supporting many users. But programs using miniature tech-\nnology cannot bear the complex payloads or engineering and management interfaces \narising from this constituency building. To maintain the tight program staffing and \nfocus needed for close communication, we must control complexity. Further, unless \nwe limit spacecraft mass and volume, we may lose a launch niche. Increasing launch \ncosts pressure us to provide higher reliability through redundancy, formal program \ncontrols, discrete quality assurance,. and increased paperwork and subsystem testing. \nInstead, we should usually split demanding payloads into separate programs rather \nthan lose the advantage of miniature satellite technology. \n\nSmall Space Systems Capabilities and AppUcations 863 \n\nEarlier, we pointed out that trying to lighten structures beyond a practical minimum \nmass made designs more complex without reducing launch costs. A conservative, sim-\nple design helps us avoid complexity in the miniature satellite program. The program \ncannot support independent specialists analyzing various thermal, mechanical, stabil-\nity, and other properties. Designing conservatively ~liminates detailed .an:uysis, thus \nmaintaining\u00b7 the small development team and keepmg the program WIthin cost and \nschedule. \n\nWe can also justify less analysis because the small spacecraft's physical dimen-\nsions support smaller therinal gradients. Simultaneously, their .vibration-resonant \nfrequencies tend to be high whereas applied moments are low, owmg to short unsup-\nported structure lengths. Wall thicknesses typically depend more on screw thread \ndepth requirements and machining tolerances. Thus, designs often include substantial \nstructural and heat transfer margins. Finite element modeling can then be eliminated \nin favor of analyzing the overall system and a few critical parts. Therefore, we can save \ntime and resources and need not hire more people to develop, run and maintain com-\nplex models and simulations. \n\n22.2 Small Space Systems Capabilities and Applications \n\n22.2.1 Abilities of Small Space Systems \n\nSmaller space vehicles can support only one or two features of the most capable \nsystems; larger systems dominate when we need many features. Thus, we wi!1 survey \nwhat small spacecraft can do with the caveat that we must normally custonnze them \nto each user's requirements. Although we can probably increase a parameter's perfor-\nmance if an application depended on it, we usually gauge what is possible against what \nhas already been done or, at least, is in development. \n\nTable 22-2 lists some of the common guidance and control techniques that have \nspecial merit for small-satellite programs. Chapter 11 discusses satellite stabilization \nin more detail. One option--no stabilization hardware at all--is a simple and therefore \nattractive alternative for small-satellite applications. To achieve downlink margin and \nadequate power in any attitude, satellite antennas need to have spherical coverage and \nsolar cells must be distributed over the entire satellite surface. Many conventional sat-\nellites require gain antennas for two reasons. Frrst, the satellite is in ~ high orbit :md \nhence distant from the ground station. Second, the telemetry rates required by multiple \non-orbit operations increase the load on the radio link. We do not need antenna gain \nor stabilization to operate small satellites only a few hundred kilometers above the \nEarth's surface with a single, low-data-rate mission. \n\nPassive stabilization, either aerodynamic, magnetic or gravity gradient, is often \nused to minimize cost and complexity. Aerodynamically stabilized satellites are \nsimple but must be in very low orbit to be effectiv~. Beca~ orbital decay shortens ~e \nmission life to less than one year, we should use It only In low-cost systems. GraVIty \ngradient torques can passively stabilize. a sate~te in an ~~POin~ ori~ntati?D. \nSmall satellites have used this configuration for mcreased radio-link gam and unagm,3 \nof the Earth's surface. Permanent magnets may also stabilize a small satellite by align-\ning it with the Earth's magnetic field. This technique often comb~es with. spin \nmaintenance schemes using solar radiation pressure. Completely passive and highly \nreliable, the technique can also allow about 3 dB oflink gain. \n\n\n\n864 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.2 \n\nTABLE 22-2.

Thus, they often are first to employ new technol-\nogIes such as was the case with full-time digital charge control. \n\n22.2 Small Space Systems Capabilities and Applications 86S \n\nPower available in contemporary low-cost satellites ranges from a few watts in \nunstabilized, Hitchhiker-sized spheres such as NuSat to over 60 W in Sun-stabilized \nvehicles like ALEXIS. While scaling arguments favor small vehicles, the absolute \nvalue of the steady-state power produced in LEO is typically small. Duty cycling \nusually satisfies a payload's need for more power. Where this is not possible, the \npower requirements can drive up costs, because the satellite must provide more solar \npanel area, and may need articulating solar panels when the spacecraft surface is not \nlarge enough. \n\nSmall satellites have provided superior information processing at a very low price. \nSmall satellites with prices under $5 million are equipped with DSP and Pentium and \nPower PC microprocessors. Using static RAM or very low drain DRAM, the satellite \ncan supply several Gbits of solid-state memory to buffer data between ground station \npasses while consuming less than 5 W of power for all systems combined. Satellites \nweighing under 20 kg have given us a full range of onboa.'li signal processing: data \ncompression, error encoding, as well as data checking and decoding or encrypting and \ndeciphering algorithms. \n\nSmall, low-cost systems have flown with various telemetry and communications \nsystems, including VHF, UHF, and microwave links using PM and digital transmis-\nsion ranging from 300 baud to 1 Mbaud. To obtain digital rates up to about 9,600 baud \nduplex, we typically use non directional antennas on the ground and on the orbiting \nplatform as well as NBPM (Narrow Band FM). The short slant range to a satellite in \nLEO has allowed us to develop ground units as small as a pocket calculator, which can \nuplink and downlink digital messages. At the same time, directional dishes operating \nat the S or X band can satisfy missions with requirements for very high data rates. \nMaintaining low program cost depends in part on the designer's ability to minimize \ndata rate and bandwidth, which drive costs on the ground and on the satellite. As the \ndata rate increases, we need more expensive components and new systems elements, \nsuch as a steerable dish capable of the high angular rates of LEO satellites observed \nfrom Earth. \n\nAs discussed in Sec. 22.1, launch costs do not change linearly with payload mass. \nIn smaller vehicles, the actual cost will depend on negotiations with other payloads \ncomprising the full launch payload, because even a very small payload is a significant \nfraction of the total. On larger vehicles, flying as a secondary, space-available payload \nmay allow lower-than-standard pricing. Special launch services, such as the Shuttle, \nHitchhiker and Ariane ASAP programs, fix prices up to a maximum allowable carrier \ncapacity. To spend less money overall, we need to survey existing launch resources \nand build to match the largest number of candidate vehicles. In this way, we can get a \nquick, cost-efficient ride on the fITSt launcher with available space. \n\nHigher prices per kg are associated with small vehicles such as Pegasus and Shavit \nbecause economies of scale favor larger launch vehicles. However, because a small \npayload may occupy all or at least a major part of a small vehicle, the small payload \noperator has more control over launch schedule and final orbit than when purchasing \nsecondary space on a larger rocket. Secondary payload accommodations being offered \nby the Hitchhiker and ASAP programs are priced mainly to cover basic administrative \ncosts. The Space Shuttle programs offer an unusual value if we can live with the safety, \nmass, and orbit limitations of that program. Ariane and Delta offer adapters to carry \nmany small payloads, and Ariane has Immched several AMSAT satellites. These \nvehicles have well-established launch records and pricing structures well below small, \ndedicated launch. vehicles. Both Ariane and Delta offer launches for commercial \npayloads. \n\n\n\n866 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.2 \n\n22.2.2 EmergingMiDiature and Low-Cost Technologies \n\nSmall satellites depend heavily on increased ability to compute and store data using \nlow power. An 8.5-kg microsat's capability today was unavailable in the 112-ton sat-\nellites of 15 years ago. Digital communicatious and large data buffers ushered in the \nstore and forward operating mode, wliich dovetailed with the communications archi-\ntecture natural to LEO satellites. Advances in these same areas may further benefit \nsmall satellites, but our fear of risk slows applications of new technology to space. \nParticularly, concerns over the effects of radiation on integrated circuits in the space \nenvironment have retarded the transfer of digital technologies to miniature satellite \ndevices. This partly explains why, as terrestrial machines transitioned to Pentium and \nPower PC microprocessors, the first 8086 derivative was not used in orbit until the \n199Os. Thus, we have plenty of room to apply advances in integrated-circuit technol-\nogy to miniature devices. \n\nWhatever progress is made in data manipulation and storage devices, many payload \ndevices will still have intrinsic power requirements which are hard to reduce. These \ninclude radio transmitters, optical beacous, active coolers, and guidance and control \nhardware such as magnetic torque coils and momentum wheels. Better conversion of \nsolar to electrical power will enable advances in miniature technology devices now \nrelying mainly on silicon-based photovoltaics and NiCd batteries. GaAs photovoltaics \nare becoming common on small spacecraft with even more efficient cells now appear-\ning on the horizon. The major effect of improvements in technologies for photovoltaic \nand energy storage will be to increase the scope of orbital functious which miniature \nsatellite devices can perform. \n\nOften up to 20% of spacecraft mass is batteries. Lithium ion secondary batteries are \nnow transitioning into microsatellites to reduce mass and improve performance. \nMomentum wheels are now scaling down in size, mass, power and cost to accommo-\ndate smaller satellites. \n\nAdvances in focal plane technology already allow very small satellites to carry \ndigital imaging over a range of detector wavelengths. Sensitive, dense focal planes can \nenable high-resolution imaging with reduced objective lens diameter and poorer \npointing stability. Advanced techniques for compressing image data, as well as \nincreasing density of digital memory, will ease the burden of acquiring and storing \nimage data for later transmission to Earth. Commercial organizations and countries \nnow recognize that a low-cost satellite can perform meaningful imaging. This has \nspawned the startup of new commercial imaging companies serving specific market \nniches, as well as numerous new government-sponsored remote sensing satellite \nprojects. \n\nAs we continue to reduce electronics size, the aperture requirements will increas-\ningly determine satellite size, mass, and, ultimately, cost Particularly, high gain \nantennas, very fast, high resolution optics, and solar power collection, require large \napertures. Thus, a key technology will be development of low massllow cost deploy-\nable optics, solar arrays and antennas. \n\nA satellite on orbit is a type of robot It is a device which carries out various phys-\nical activities under control of an autonomous, synthetic controller. As terrestrial \nrobotic devices become more capable, it is logical that satellites will become more \ncapable and more autonomous. This would enable new applications involving \nextended periods of autonomy (perhaps for missions outside of the Earth-Moon sys-\ntem), intelligent interactions with other space and terrestrial objects, and coordination \nof the behavior of large numbers of small satellites. \n\n22.2 SmaD Space Systems Capabilities and Applications 867 \n\nWhile the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Air Force, and NASA \ntry to develop a new generation of launch vehicles for small payloads, no launch tech-\nnology breakthroughs appear to be on the horizon. Organizations are working very \nhard to create marginal savings in launch costs, and conventional, large vehicles \nremain the most cost-efficient way to inject a satellite into orbit We expect no major \nadvances in launch technology in the next decade. \n\nUntil a few years ago, advanced designs for spacecraft architecture focused almost \ncompletely on conventional technology devices. The recent attention paid to systems \ncomposed of smaller, less costly components on-orbit is likely to produce new \napplications better suited to them, such as missions requiring a network of detectors \ndistributed in orbit around the Earth or Sun. Previously, such concepts were dismissed \nbecause building and launching many conventional satellites into different, highly \nenergetic orbits are expensive. Reducing launch mass by an order of magnitude or \nmore may make these missions economically feasible. \n\nIn general, anticipated technological advances in information prOcessing, solid \nstate detectors, autonomous intelligence and power conversion will all increase appli-\ncations of miniature technology. As we discover new systems architectures and \ndevelop new applications for satellite systems, miniature technology will take on \nheightened importance in future space programs. \n\n22.2.3 Potential Applications \n\nAn array of satellites in random, low-Earth orbits can provide fully connected, \ncontinuous communications, as Fig. 22-2 shows. This fact has spawned numerous \nsatellite programs which divide into the Big and Little LEOs. Big LEOs offer real-time \nconnectivity, mainly for telephone but ultimately for very high bandwidth \napplications. Little LEOs are one- and two-way digital message carriers, used for asset \ntracking, monitoring and paging. All of the systems currently contemplated are con-\nstellations, meaning the spacecraft maintain constant position relative to each other. \nThe number of satellites in the constellation ranges from 5 or 6 in the case of some \nLittle LEOs servicing limited areas or with long latency-the time between passes \nover a user location. Big LEOs with constellations of 24 to over 240 satellites are in \ndevelopment In general, larger numbers of satellites can provide higher bandwidth. \nSome of the systems use inter-satellite links to forward signals beyond their own foot-\nprint Others immediately relay communication from the user to a ground station \nwhich feeds the data via the terrestrial network. \n\nUnlike the constellations, satellite clusters consist of large numbers of satellite \nrandomly distributed in their orbit planes without propulsion to maintain fixed relative \nto positions. These satellites are smaller and simpler than those in the constellations. \nThey can be fit into available space on virtually any LEO launch. In time, such a net-\nwork would become fully populated. Computer modeling of clusters shows that 400 \nsatellites in random orbits provide 95% global coverage and 100% coverage from \nother orbiting platforms. Thus, the satellite cluster could support both point-to-point \nground communications and satellite-to-ground links. One significant feature of satel-\nlite arrays, either constellation or clusters, to worldwide communications from the mil-\nitary viewpoint is its intrinsic survivability. Destruction of 1 or even 20 of the cluster's \nmembers barely affects the network's overall effectiveness. Presumably the smaIl, \nsimple, mass-produced satellites of the cluster would be less expensive than the weap-\non required to destroy them. Their small-size would make them intrinsically difficult \n\n\n\nDesign of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.2 \n\nFig. 22-2. Satellite Cluster. Many small satellites in randomly distributed low-Earth orbits can \nprovide point-ta-point global communication. \n\nto track and would also pennit fabrication from materials transparent to radar. Their \nintrinsic redundancy and graceful degradation justify applying inexpensive, single-\nstring design and fabrication techniques which will further reduce cost. \n\nAnother application of small satellites is for low-cost imaging. These systems use \nadvanced focal-plane technologies to obtain fine optical resolution with relatively sim-\nple guidance systems. By using multiple satellites in clusters or constellations, \nfrequent image updates can be combined with good ground resolution. SniaIler, low-\ncost satellite can be optimized to specific applications such as agriculture, coastal zone \nmanagement or land use and taxation. Several businesses and countries are developing \nsystems that will eventually eliminate the monopoly of a few large government-owned \nsystems on optical space surveillance of Earth-bound activities. \n\nAMSAT and several commercial and government organizations are developing or \nusing small satellites in geosynchronous orbits. AMSAT plans to supplement existing \nglobal digital communications from LEO satellites with real-time digital and analog \ncommunications. Indostar is the first of a new generation of geosynchronous satellites \nsupporting only a few transponders. These small geosynchronous comsats could serve \nas on-orbit spares. Moreover, they appeal to smaller corporate and national users \nwhich cannot themselves support a conventional GEO comsat. These users must now \neither lease individual channels of a large satellite or become a member of a conglom-\nerate such as Intelsat. Using miniature satellite devices with lower capability and price, \nsmaller users can own and hence control the entire space asset, increasing their auton-\nomy and security. Though GEO launch costs traditionally are high, small satellites can \nhold down those costs by piggy-backing on a GEO neighbor's launch, if available. \nHowever, few small satellites can take advantage of the GEO orbit. . \n\nMeasurements of rapidly varying fields over astronomically significant baselines is \nimpossible with a single satellite. By the time the satellite flies across the region of \ninterest, temporal variations in the field distort the map. By flying tens to hundreds of \nvery small satellites in varying trajectories, we can observe such phenomena as the \ncharged-particle environments and magnetic-field variations of the Earth and Sun. \n\n22.3 Applying MIniature Satellite Technology to FireSat 869 \n\nParticularly for solar observations, the desired trajectory energy is quite high, so we \nneed low satellite mass. Small satellites are ideally suited for this class of \nmission-requiring many spacecraft inserted into energetic trajectories. Due to the \nscientific nature and high launch costs of such missions, they are best suited for NASA \nand other national science and research organizations. \n\n22.3 Applying Miniature Satellite Technology to FireSat \n\nTo show how the small satellite conceptual process works, we will look at the \napplication of miniature technology to the FrreSat problem of detecting and monitor-\ning forest fires either nationally or worldwide. This system is challenged to provide \nrapidly updated data on a firefront's genesis, topology and local progress to the Forest \nService's central office: A network of low-flying reconnaissance spacecraft could \nresolve the firefront to a few meters through multispectral imagers. Then the satellite \ncould find the spread rate by staring at the front during a pass and applying image \nprocessing techniques to the downlinked data. Direct broadcast to the field through a \ngeosynchronous comsat would forward the derived data to the firefighting teams. Such \na system would be highly complex and costly. We believe that this system does not \nexist because conventional satellite technology cannot ,meet the user's recognized \nrequirements at an affordable price. \n\nSerious forest and brush fires often begin with a simple match or a spark that is hard \nto see from an orbiting platform. One potential solution is to fly very low-resolution \nimagers filtered to the near IR. Data on nascent fires would be downlinked to a simple \nground station which could reconstruct the low-resolution images and compare them \nwith ground truth, such as the locations of large cities and other bright areas. The low \nresolution and subsequent low bandwidth will allow use of PC-based ground stations \nlike those already built for earlier small imaging satellites. This solution para1Iels the \nconventional technology approach, but with minimum capability. \n\nA more innovative solution would deploy simple thermocouple sensors from air-\ncraft, with small nets to catch them in treetops, where forest fires spread. Fitted with a \nlithium primary battery and a 1-W uplink transmitter, the sensor could simply tum on \n(much like an Emergency Locator Transmitter) when its temperature reaches, say, \n80 DC, broadcasting its digitally encoded serial number to a simple small satellite for \ndigital messaging. \n\nAfter discovering a forest frre, monitors would dispatch an aircraft to the firefront \nto drop a denser network of more sophisticated sensors. These sensors could transmit \nthe local temperature and their own ID number to the aircraft, which would maintain \na map of the sensor locations by recording them as each sensor is dropped. As the sat-\nellite overflew, it would receive the signals of the upgraded sensors, causing it to \nrebroadcast a map of sensor ID numbers and temperatures to the local firefighting \ncrew. Their ground station would receive a map of sensor ID numbers and locations, \nso they could immediately derive a temperature contour map. Figure 22-3 shows the \ncomplete system. \n\nA simple treetop sensor would be inexpensive because it consists of only a beacon, \na battery and a thermocouple. Dispersing the sensors could occur during routine \ntransportation and patrol flights because the sensors are merely scattered. The satel-\nlites serving this application would be very small, simple devices, which any sort of \nlaunch vehicle could launch. All firefighting crews would need small, portable ground \nstations, and the aircraft deploying sensors would use GPS to record location when \n\n\n\n870 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft \n\nBasagruund ___ ~\"\" \n__ uslng_o/_(~) \n\n~ WIdely dispersed monIIot sensors \n\ni Densely dispersed active lim sensors \n\nFIg. 22-3. Flresat System Concept The miniature sateDJte concept for a AreSat system \nminimizes on-orbit cost by using an array of sensors for monitoring and for relaying \ninformation about particular fires to firefighters. \n\ndropping each high-resolution sensor. A laptop computer would allow an operator to \nenter data as the sensors drop. The ground control stations consist of little more than \nthe field units, a small computer, transmitter, receiver and omnidirectional antenna. \n\nThe system described above would provide the following: \nI \n\n\u2022 Global monitoring of new forest fires from a few ground stations located any-\nwhere on Earth \n\n\u2022 Ability to locate fJrefronts to treetop resolution after identifying a fightable \nblaze \n\n\u2022 Communication of the fire progress directly to the field commander \n\nWith this approach, we benefit from minimal on-orbit requirements, cheap replace-\nment, and built-in redundancy. With several satellites on orbit, if one fails, the system \ndegrades only slightly. Any launch to LEO can potentially rebuild the system. Suppli-\ners of miniature satellites can put needed spacecraft on orbit in under a year, and the \nsystem could be operating 18 months after contract go-ahead. \n\nNote that in this example miniature satellite technology is considered a systems \narchitecture discipline. This designation is accurate and intentional. Miniature tech-\nnology is not a special set of technologies used for building conventional capabilities \ninto small, cheap boxes. It is a new way of looking at an application to develop a \nsolution which doesn't require conventional technology and which a closely-knit team \nof under 20 satellite engineers can handle. Using miniature technology architecture, a \n\n22.4 Scaling from Large to Small Systems 871 \n\nspacecraft needs only modest capabilities to detect and mouitor forest fires. The satel-\nlites need only listen for beacons and crudely locate them to within a few kilometers \nor tens of kilometers. In the second mode of operation, at the fJrefront, the uplinked \ndata from even a few thousand beacons is much less than\u00b7 1 Mbit. . \n\nThe 13-cm Microsat cube developed and flown successfully by AMSAT North \nAmerica and shown in Fig. 22-4 is an example of the type of miniature technology \ndevice which can meet all of the satellite requirements for .the FireSat mission. The \nmicrosats weigh only 8.5 kg and are fitted typically with 8 Mbits of RAM. The unsta-\nbilized satellites carry omnidirectional antennas providing sufficient link to recognize \na low-bandwidth, O.S-W beacon at the Earth's horizon from 800-km orbit. \n\nFIg. 22-4. MlcroSat Cube Developed by AMSAT North America. This 13-cm, 8.5-kg satellite \nfirst flown in 1990 could meet the space segment requirements for the RreSat concept \nshown in Ag. 22-3. \n\nEven in small quantities these satellites can be produced for less than $400,000, \nbecause they are so simple. By using several satellites, the system itself is redundant, \nso each satellite can be simpler, less reliable, and of a single-string design. Lower \nreliability requirements allow us to procure commercial-grade components without \nspecial ordering, testing or quality assurance. With this method, we can buy parts \ncheaper and design more efficiently by using more modem, capable components. We \ncan also cut engineering time spent finding qualified parts and working with vendors \nto meet program specifications. \n\nSimple mission requirements allow the satellites to be quite small, thus greatly \nreducing launch and ground-support costs. In fact, we can transport them to a test or \nlauncb site by commercial airliner as carry-on luggage. \n\n22.4 Scaling from Large to Small Systems \n\nThe fact that miniature technology devices tend to be physically small means that \npbysical sealing laws will account for some fundamental differences between minia-\nture and conventional satellite devices. A conventional device can also be physically \n\n\n\n872 Design ofLow-Cost Spacecraft 22.4 \n\nsmall; this section addresses only the engineering differences which become signifi-\ncant when we develop a very small spacecraft. \n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 22-5, scaling up a simple cylindrical satellite by factor 5 in \nlinear dimension increases its projected area by 25 and its volume by 125. If we \nassume that mass and power consumption are roughly proportional to the volume of \nelectronics, this simple geometric scaling has implications for the systems designer. \nAs satellite size decreases, its power requirement decreases faster than its projected \narea. So smaller satellites typically do not need deployable solar panels. \n\nProJecIed \n\na:.' M=1 \n0=1 \n\n~ \n1=1 \n\nProjecJ8d \nArea =25 \n\n1=3125 \n\nFIg. 22-5. Effect of Scaling Up a Simple Cylindrical Satellite. D Is the linear dimension, Mis \nthe mass, and lis the moment of inertia. \n\nAs we have mentioned, physically short thermal and load paths characteristic of \nsmaller satellites usually allow less critical thermal and structural design. The small \nsatellite of linear dimension 1 has to conduct 1 unit of heat flux over a maximum \ndistance 0.5. The larger satellite must conduct 125 units of heat flux over a maximum \ndistance of 2.5, requiring roughly 125 times more temperature difference between the \nsatellite surface and interior. Presumably, thicker structural members in the larger \nsatellite partly offset this difference, but satellite thermal considerations rarely affect \nstructural design very much. Similarly, supporting the satellite from its edges (for \nexample) resnlts in much thicker structure relative to size for a large satellite than for \na small one. This advantage to small size diminishes somewhat because wall thick-\nnesses in very small devices often depend on machining and handling limits. Thus, we \ncannot build the small satellite to theoretical structural limits, so it tends to be heavier \nand a better heat conductor than it wonld be if designed optimally for strength. \n\nThe thermal and structural oversizing typical of small satellites tends to affect \nprograms positively and negatively. Miniature technology devices tend to be built to \nexceed specifications, so they require very little analytical effort to ensure their struc-\ntural and thermal integrity compared with conventional technology devices. Also they \nrarely require special, costly thermal and structural materials and devices such as high \nstrength alloys, composites, or heat pipes. \n\nOn the other hand, miniature technology devices support the operational payload \non orbit less efficiently because of design expediency and difficulty in manufacturing \nvery thin, light. small structures. As Fig. 22-6 illustrates, OSCAR 13, a miniature tech-\nnology comsat, has much more of its mass devoted to support fimctions such as \n\n22.5 Economics of Low-Cost Space Systems 873 \n\nstructure, guidance, and propnlsion than the geosynchronous comsat. Palapa B, which \nuses conventional technology. Only 21.5% of OSCAR 13's weight carries payload \nelectronics compared with 34.5% of Palapa B's. We cannot precisely compare large \nand small satellites because their missions and operating conditions are so different. \nBut Fig. 22-6 shows that the key to miniature systems is not a new technology or trick \nwhich allows its practitioners a special advantage over conventional systems. It is a \nsystems discipline which allows its engineers to meet a user requirement cheaply and \nquickly despite its inherent disabilities. \n\n21.5% \n\nOSCAR 13, at 85 kg \ndry mass, is 16% as \nJarge as Palapa 8 \n(530 kg dry). \n\nOSCAR's relatively \nsimple, \u00b11\u00b0 spin \nstabilized G&C \nsystem Is none-\ntheless almost twice \nas large, relative to \noverall mass, as \nPalapa 8's full three \naxis system. \n\n34.5% \n\nOSCAR 13 WIO Propenant \n\nEI Payload \nIIIIIITT&C \n\\ll.B Structure \n(iJ PropuJsIon \nII] Power \n\nlSI Guidance \n[J Thermal \n\nFIg. 22-6. Comparison of Satellite Mass Efficiency. Comparison of OSCAR 13 with Palapa 8 \nillustrates the d\"lffIculty in scaling spacecraft G&C systems for sman satenites. \n\n22.5 Economics of Low-Cost Space Systems \n\nTo survive as an industry, low-cost space systems must be more cost effective than \nspace- and ground-based alternatives. To confirm savings, we must verify that we can \ncomplete and fly hardware successfully at low cost. The value to the user must be at \nleast as large in proportion to cost (including accounting for risk) as competing alter-\nnatives, such as conventional technology. \n\nExperit<nce in some of the more recent small satellites illustrates the ran~e of costs \nwhich can be expected in a small satellite program. Table 22-3 lists approxunate pro-\ngram costs for some small satellites (in 1990 dollars). \n\n\n\n-------------------------------- --\n\n874 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.5 \n\nTABLE 22-3.

Understanding the basis for this cost difference \nis more complex. The cost pyramid in Fig. 22-7 is one way of explaining the dramatic \ndifference between miniature and conventional costs for a small, astronomical satellite \nproposed as a university research program to NASA. The pyramid tracks cost growth \nin translating a hypothetical miniature satellite program to a conventional program \nwith similar operational specifications. The pyramid topology is apt because each \nextra cost adds to the previous cost. Thus the cost growth is more geometric than arith-\nmetic. \n\nStarting with an initial satellite cost of $2M, we would establish a dialogue with the \nscientific user group to try to reduce program cost while maintaining the scientific \nvalue of the mission. This vertically integrated process leads us to modify operations \nby relaxing the pointing accuracy, thus saving considerable money at the second stra-\ntum of the pyramid. \n\n22.S \n\nFIg. 22-7. \n\nEconomics of Low-Cost Space Systems \n\n... ----Minimum Cost Program: \nPrice:$2.0M \n\n... --- 5x Higher Pointing Ace: $6.1 M \n\n.. Hi-Reliability Speciflcation: $7.5 M \n\n4-- FuU Traceability: $12.1 M \n\n...... Formal Periodic Reviews: $14.5 M \n\n~ Large Business Overhead: \nConventional Program Price: $17.8 M \n\n875 \n\nConventional Satellites Impose Significant Costs over a Low-cost, Small Satel-\nlite Program. In this example based on design studies of a small astronomical \nsatellite, the development cost is $2M compared with -$18M for a conventional . \nsatellite for the same mission. Additional costs for test, ground station, and on-orbit \noperations will further widen the cost gap between the two approaches. \n\nIn this case, the user group had a fixed budget ceiling. Thus, as is ofteJ) true in \nminiature satellites, the reliability trade off reduces to a choice between controlling \ncost (at increased risk) and cancelling the program. The choice to accept industrial-\ngrade components saved -$15M compared to space grade. Because small satellites \nhave 10% to 1 % as many parts as larger spacecraft, part failme is less significant to \nachieving mission reliability. Thus, small satellites\u00b7 routinely employ less expensive, \nmore modem and more readily available commercial parts saving money via parts \ncost, shortened schedule and simplified design. In some cases, contractors cannot eas-\nily purchase individual space-grade parts, so they must buy parts in lots and test them, \nor use a more poorly suited component. Both of these options-in-house qualification \nor redesign around poorly suited components-cost much more money. \n\nComponent traceability strongly drives up costs, because it requires a program \ninfrastructure, thus driving up direct and overhead costs. Direct costs increase partly \nbecause subcontractors must attend to traceability, thus increasing the cost of supplied \ncomponents and assemblies. Traceability, like space-class specification, eliminates \nmany potential components, because mass-produced devices not already made to \nspace-class are not traceable. Industrial grade NiCd batteries are typical of this \ndilemma. Only MIL grade and above-ten times more expensive-are traceable. \n\nExtensive periodic program reviews are of questionable value at all project scales. \nBut a small team working on a miniature satellite project can save a lot of money by \nsubstituting regular communications for formal reviews. Of course, we can keep the \nteam size down if we can avoid those earlier requirements, such as higher pointing \naccuracy, S-class parts, and traceability. A program review for any sized program has \ndirect and hidden costs such as travel, time spent in meetings, preparation time, and \nmisdirection of the hardware team towards genemting paper rather than making hard-\nware. But the penalty is more significant for a small program. Budget is often s~verely \nconstrained such that airline tickets and hotel costs are significant. But more lDlpor-\ntantly, efficiency of small spacecraft development is in part rooted in the smal! size of \nthe team.. Additional burdens including numerous reviews and part tracking can \ninflate team size. beyond that allowing very rapid, informal interactions or that \nencourage optimal resource allocations. \n\n\n\n876 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.5 \n\nAlthough the exact numbers in the cost pyramid are all estimates derived from a \nstudy of system architecture, present experience with miniature and conventional pr0-\ngrams and contractors supports them. The interest in missions using miniature \nsatellites directly relates to this cost difference. \n\nThe above arguments notwithstanding, we still must show that particular missions \ncan be performed more cost effectively with miniature technology than with conven-\ntional technology. Clearly, to achieve cost and schedule benefits, users of miniature \ntechnology must sacrifice some performance but also realize important gains in sched-\nule. We cannot compare conventional and miniature products purely with numbers, \nbecause they differ qualitatively. But the following example illustrates how miniature \ntechnology can save money and increase reliability of an overall system. \n\nA 50-kg satellite can be launched piggyback for between $50,000 and $IM, \ndepending on the launcher. The Pegasus launcher has enough payload to launch about \n10 satellites of 50 kg each for $1.5M each. When we have invested little in the launch, \nwe can tolerate a less reliable satellite. A 9O%-reliable satellite built for $IM plus a \n$IM launch investment (on-orbit cost of $2M) has an expected cost to 100% reliability \nof \n\n$2M + 0.90 = $2.22M \n\nThat is, to get 9 satellites working on orbit, we will need to build and launch 10, so \nthe effective cost per satellite increases incrementally. As mentioned earlier, engi-\nneering to increase reliability in a single satellite costs a lot of money. Numerous \nsubsystem assemblies and more complex control systems drive up these costs. The \nmost reliable components can cost many times more than their commercial counter-\nparts. A 28V stack of space-qualified NiCd batteries with 40 W-hr total charge costs \nabout $40,000 and weighs 10 kg. The best commercial technology available from the \nsame supplier costs $180 and weighs 4 kg. At $20,000Ikg launch cost, the total savings \nis $159,820. Thus, the cost ratio between high and moderate reliability systems is 3:1. \n\nOf course, we should not use small satellites when we cannot reduce the payload's \nsize, mass, or support; the satellite will require a large fixed investment and a costly \nlaunch. For example, if the FireSat needs an imaging system with an optical objective \nof I-mdiameter, fitted to a steerable platform with arc-minute accuracy and stability, \npresent technology would make the system's mass well over a ton. Launch costs will \nbe near $4OM, and payload costs could be equally large. With $IOOM invested in the \nsystem, the value of increasing reliability from 90% to 95% is $5.9M. Thus, adding \nredundant systems to roughly double reliability can be quantitatively justified if they \nincrease costs less than this amount. Miniature technology is not appropriate for such \na large mission, regardless of reliability. For one thing, a group of people each charged \nwith understanding most of the total system could not fabricate such a large system. \nThe more bureaucratic approaches of conventional technology will work better in this \ncase. \n\nWe also cannot accurately measure the cost of failure simply by quoting orbit-\nsystem cost (satellite plus launch vehicle). Some payloads are worth more than their \ndollar price, the prime example being crewed vehicles. The value to society of preserv_ \ning life is very high, particularly in a public government activity during peace time. \nAlso, even if we accurately measure the space component's cost, we can still under-\nestimate the real cost of a failure. Many missions require coordination with other \nvaluable assets. Deploying and reconfiguring of space and ground assets for a space \ntest can require more financial commitment than the space vehicle itself. Lost oppor-\n\n22.5 Economics of Low-Cost Space Systems 877 \n\ntunities are also quite costly. If a single, large surveillance satellite fails on orbit, we \nmay not secure continuous observation, thus losing politically vital data that is more \nvaluable than the on-orbit asset. . \n\nUltimately, we must associate a cost with on-orbit failure, assessing severa11ev~ls \nof reliability in terms of program cost, complexity, and schedule. We can then ~de \nwhether to build to reliability requirements. In comparing a spectrum of candidates, \nwe must remember that cost and reliability may not relate directly. A much smaller, \nsimpler spacecraft, built by a very small group whose members are f~ar ~th the \nwhole system can be more reliable than a much more complex solution despIte the \nlatter's more reliable parts and redundancies. ... . \n\nOther non-econornic factors also playa role in selecting conventional over lDlma-\nture technology. Risks in program management often deter designers from applying \n\n. miniature technology. The person who must deploy a one-of-a-J?n~ sp~ vehicle may \nknow that the final price will be unimportant so long as the lDlSSlon IS a success. <?r \nconversely, he or she understands that a failure, no matter how cheaply executed, IS \nstill a failure. Wise program managers use miniature satellite methods for smaIl, rela-\ntively simple applications, not for highly complex ~~ion~ re.lyin.g upon large teams. \nLaunch of many satellites also better follows probabilIty distnbutions. \n\nWe should not, however, overestimate the importance of single string design to the \ncost advantages of small satellites. In fact, many small satellites have incorporated \nhighly redundant architectures. ALEXIS includes a highly redundant digital system',a \npower system which is quadruply redundant and 3 parallel payload systems. DSI s \nMacSats were virtually fully redundant. \n\nAlso important is the application oflow-cost approaches to ~ubsystems. The e~am\u00ad\npIe mentioned above of substituting commercial NiCd batt~es for space-q~alIfied \nones can save up to $IM in the cost of a 200-kg small satellite. ALEXIS cam~ ~o \ncustom Sun sensors built by AeroAstro, each for about 10% of the cost ?f eXIsting \nspace qualified units. Because they use less power, and ~ smaller and lIghter than \nSun sensors designed for larger satellites with more deman~g performance and q?al-\nity specifications, their cost savings ripple thr?ugh. the en~ spacecraft bus desIgn. \nThe net savings in using simpler Sun sensors IS estimated m the case of ALEXIS to \nhave been several hundred thousand dollars. \n\nBecause the torques required to stabilize a small satelliu: are small, use of costl1 \niron core torque coils is often not necessary.lnstea~ much SImpler ~d lower cost arr \ncore coils can be used. Typically this can result m $50,000 m savmgs for a small \nsatellite. When the design is correctly accomplished, a small satellite is not structure-\nlimited. In fact. Martin Sweeting of Surrey Satellites has said !hat th~ diffen:n~e \nbetween large and small satellites is whether a distinct structure IS ~quired. This IS \nbecause small satellite characteristic lengths are short, and structure IS usually over-\nbuilt due to manufacturing constraints (metal needs to be thick enough to su~port \nfasteners and thereby becomes thicker than necessary tor purely struc~. co~slder\u00ad\nations) or because the mass savings of a weight reduction F~ ~n t Slgnifi~t. \nIn any case, there is a savings both in that higher cost matenals, mc1uding compoSItes, \nare generally not used, and little structural analysis is.req~. .. \n\nVery significant cost savings are realized by specification of COmmercIal, mstead \nof military or space, grade components. Savings result from several benefits. Of course \nMil-B and S-class parts are quite costly-sometimes 10 to 100 times more than the \nequivalent commercial part lacking the qualification inspections and pa~ork. They \nare rarely available in small numbers, since they are built and tested m separate \n\n\n\n878 Design of Low-Cost Spacecraft 22.5 \n\nproduction runs. One integrated circuit, available for $50 commerciaIly, may cost \n$500 in S-class, but may only be available in lots of20--increasing the purchase cost \nto $10,000. Perhaps more importantly, the most modem technologies are seldom \navailable in higher grade components, forcing a compromise to inelegant design solu-\ntions. The HETE spacecraft, built to commercial specifications, takes advantage of \nseveral modem, radiation-hard, semi-custom, integrated circuit components which \neliminate hundreds of S-class integrated circuits from the parts count Besides reduc-\ning parts costs by tens of thousands of doIlars, the modern technology reduces the \nnumber of circuit boards, greatly reduces design, development and test labor, and \nrequires much less power. The savings in spacecraft resources of power,space and \nmass, combined with the parts and labor cost savings, make the implementation of this \ncommercial technology worth hundreds of thousands of doIlars in savings to the $4M \nspacecraft budget. \n\nSome components CanDot be significantly altered for use on smaIl satellites, com-\npared with conventional designs. As an example, spacecraft photovoltaics (solar \npanels) have no market except spacecraft. In these cases, we try to work with tradition-\nal vendors to find ways to decrease costs. ParaIIeling the spacecraft design approach, \nthese may include using flight spares developed for other programs, reducing non-\nhardware deliverables (meetings and paper) and interactive design to produce a design \nspecification which is intrinsicaIly inexpensive to build and test Israeli Aircraft Indus-\ntries' MLM division has succeeded in producing spacecraft photovoltaics at less than \nhalf the cost per installed watt of conventional spacecraft photovoltaic systems, with-\nout any decrease in product quality or performance through application of these steps. \n\nFormal engineering guidelines institutionalize conventional satellite technology .. \nThe manager of a hardware development program that fails will not have to account \nfor the failure if he or she documents the program thoroughly and builds the system to \nmilitary specifications and Department of Defense guidelines. But program managers \nusing miniature technology employ untried components when it is cost-effective and \nthey perceive little risk. Yet, if their programs fail, they are accountable. \n\nThus far we have concentrated on two important motivators for application of smaIl \nsatellites-cost and unique capabilities. But smaIl satellites, owing to their simpler \narchitecture, the smaller team required for their development, and the smaIler amounts \nof money required, can be built on very rapid schedules. AMSAT, motivated by the \navailability of a near-term launch slot, produced and flew a smaIl satellite in 9 months. \nWith typical development time as short as 18 months, the spacecraft development \nschedule is usuaIIy dominated more by the bureaucratic delays in getting a program \nstarted, than by the time to engineer, build, test, modify, retest and deploy a smaIl \nsatellite. \n\nFigure 22-8 shows that besides the quantitative shortening of the development \nschedule, smaIl sateIIite development is a highly interactive process. Activity begins \nwhen a particular mission is identified-in the case ofFiresat this could be the mission \nto detect forest fires. In discussions between the user community and the development \ngroup.in the ensuing 30 days, several very low resolution sketches of possible sateIIite \nconfigurations can be developed, each tailored to different launch vehicles, different \nsize, mass, cost constraints, and different performance levels. This helps users to \nunderstand the impact of their budget on the ultimate capabilities they can achieve. If \nthere is no way to get something of value for the user within the user budget, the pr0-\ngram needs to be reconsidered and certainly there shouldn't be additional resource \nexpended on detailed design until at least a tangency between the cost and utility \ncurves is achieved. \n\n22.5 Economics of Low-Cost Space Systems 879 \n\n\u2022 \no 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 \n\nTime (months) \n\nFig. 22-8.

This is important We do not achieve .the lowest pos-\nsible satellite size and mission cost by a priori assignment of reqUIrements to the \nsatellite design.Just one especiaIly difficult requirement, ~ibly not vital to the ~~':f\u00ad\nall mission, can result in a costly and unwieldy design.

Even at this very early stage, there will be \ncomponents which everyone knows wiIl be needed. Th~e might include an ov~rsup\u00ad\nply of NiCd batteries for later selection or the photo voltaic celIs necessary to build up \nsolar panels.

Even .in a. smaIl, inexpensive satellite program, the value of beginning the \nhardware flow IS high and the cost of parts ordered which end up unused is \nsmall-usually it is nearly zero.

The flight readiness review team must be made aware \nof these concerns and must be ready to delay the launch if it detennines some deficien-\ncies are not acceptable. Ideally the launch will take place immediately after the review \nto minimize the temptation to \"improve\" the spacecraft. \n\nA note on ~ogram delays may help. Interruptions in any program are always much \nmore destructive of cost and schedule than managers appreciate. In a small program \neven more than a large one, the documentation is at a minimum and the focus of the \nsmall team creates efficiency.

Do you want the user group to operate the ground facility? \n\n10. Is the mission lifetime goal less than 5 years? \n\nWe mentioned earlier that ground operations can significantly affect overall \nprogram cost. Often, the satellite's orbital lifetime is longer than its development \nperiod, and staffing of a major ground station can be larger than that of a development \nprogram for a miniature spacecraft. Miniature technology reduces ground-station costs \nthrough its systems architecture and the ground station's design. \n\nA low-cost satellite program cannot afford the luxury of ground stations staffed by \na separate operations group. Also, we may not be able to operate costly remote ground \nstations. Thus, we need to build large spacecraft memories to buffer satellite data, so \nthe satellite can store data over long periods (typically 12 to 18 hours) until it passes \nover a single ground station at the user's location. We also need to compress data on \nthe satellite, because ground stations with limited antennas and RF links may not sup-\nport high data rates. \n\nWe cannot simply design the satellite to rely upon highly expert ground controllers. \nThe user organization typically does not know the special techniques of managing a \nspacecraft. Thus, we need to use a single small computer to control the ground station, \nso the user interface is a single machine. The ground station software should be simple \nand well structured, containing on-line and written support. Where possible, we should \ngraphically represent the system status and the satellite orbit. \n\nWhenever possible, the ground station should channel the user's activity toward tlte \nright solutions. Furtlter, tlte ground station should be able to screen operator com-\nmands and activities tltat may adversely affect tlte satellite operations. When deciding \nhow much effort to expend on tlte ground station, we must trade the real costs of the \nuser group learning, input errors, and more people to manage tlte satellite against the \ncost of creating more capable software for tlte ground station. \n\nAutonomy is another important factor in the cost of ground operations. Satellites in \nLEO pass the ground station a few times per day, every day of the year. While novel \nin tlte first few days and weeks, years of tending tlte satellite at roughly 6-hour inter-\nvals can be a tremendous drain on tlte user organization. The ground station should at \nleast be able to buffer activities for a series of satellite passes. Thus, we should consid-\ner features allowing longer autonomous periods in tlte system design. An alternative \nto extended autonomy is remote operation. A dial-in system permitting limited control \nof the ground station from a remote tenninal can be valuable. Security is an issue in a \nremote architecture, but we can devise various password and call-back schemes to \nprotect the system. \n\n22.6 Annotated Bibliography on Low-Cost Space Systems \n\nThe Logic of Microspace, by R.

Wertz, Microcosm, Inc. \nWiley J. Larson, United States Air Force Academy \n\n23.1 Applying SMAD to Later Mission Phases \n23.2 Lessons Learned from Existing Space Programs \n23.3 Future Trends \n\nSince the first edition of Space Mission Analysis and Design (SMAD) appeared in \n1989, substantial progress has been made in applying this process more broadly to \nspace missions, in part because of the continuing pressure to reduce mission costs. \nWith the exception of launch, costs in all segments of space missions have been \nreduced. Launch costs, while not having succumbed as yet, are under attack from a \nwide variety of directions. A large number of communications constellations are being \ncreated that are bringing a more manufacturing-oriented methodology to bear, with an \nemphasis on both lower cost and high quality. Even inteIplanetary missions are \nbecoming quicker and less expensive. The purpose of this chapter is to summarize how \nbest to make the SMAD process work within the real environment of acquisition \nregulations, programs long past preliminary study phases, and the \"new space\" mis-\nsions which we hope will be forthcoming in future years. \n\nMuch of this book ignores two of the major challenges to doing SMAD: organiza-\ntional structure and the acquisition process. Both tend to introduce political and \nbureaucratic obstacles to our goal of developing cost-effective designs. As described \nbriefly in Sec. 21.1, any space program exists within a broad and important context of \nlaw, policy, politics, and economics which we must notignore. We are, after all, pr0-\nposing to spend large amounts of som~ne's money designin.g :md developin~ space \nmissions. Even the best program has bttle chance of success If It does not fit mto tile \npolitical, economic, and policy context that must support it. Politics can include, for \nexample, the need to have manufactiuing distributed around the country for publicly \nfunded programs or use of technology from specific companies for privately funded \nones. In any case, we need to work within these boundaries. \n\nOur goal is to learn from past space programs and apply that experience, along with \nour judgment of how to do it better. to new and ongoing programs. In practice, ,!,e \noften end up doing things the way we have always done them, perhaps because It\u00b7S \nworked or is simply easier to do than trying to change the mindset of individuals and \norganizations. Introducing change is difficult in any venue, but we must change and, \nindeed, may need to take more calculated risks if we are to drive down the cost of space \nmissions. \n\n883 \n\n\n\n884 Applying the Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 23.1 \n\nThis book develops space mission analysis and design through a series of process \ntables indexed on the inside front cover. This process flow divides into three main \nareas: high-level processes, definition of the elements, and detailed design. The high-\nlevel processes develop concepts for the mission design. With these concepts in hand, \nwe can begin defining the characteristic elements of the space mission architecture; \nThen we can design those elements in more detail. Table 1-1 in Sec. 1.1 gives you \nsimplified steps to begin designing your particular mission. Remember that success \ndepends on iterating and continuously improving the design. . \n\nWe must caution you that SMAD does not work well whenever you need much \nmore than typical estimation accuracy. Our high-level algorithms and sanity checks \nprovide estimates for conceptual design. These estimates are enough in most cases, but \nwhenever performance is critical, or if you are approaching a technology threshold, \nyou should refer to more detailed information. Areas frequently needing more than \ntypical estimation accuracy are satellite lifetimes in low-Earth orbit, computer systems \nsizing, and system cost modeling. Table 23-1 outlines ways to deal with these and \nsimilar problems. \n\nTABLE 23-1. Dealing with Areas Needing Much More Than Typical Estimation Accuracy. \n\n1. Estimate as realistically as possible by working through succeeding levels of \nthe process tables outlined in these chapters. \n\n2. estimate both upper and lower bounds. \n\n3.

Develop and maintain options. \n\n5. Be prepared to trade with overall system performance. \n\n23.1 Applying SMAD to Later Mission Phases \n\nNearly all space missions must respond appropriately to the economic and political \nforces acting on them throughout their design and operational life. At all stages of a \nprogram, we need to achieve two critical goals: \n\n\u2022 Meet bonafide mission objectives and requirements while minimizing \nprogram cost and risk \n\n\u2022 \"Sell\" the program and keep it sold, if it remains worth doing \n\nThe evolving political and economic environment may alter program objectives or \nmake the program not worth doing. Even though a program continues to be worth-\nwhile, it may still require a significant effort to demonstrate the mission utility within \nthe ever-changing environment. \n\nMinimizing Program Cost and Risk \nEarly conceptual design has a great impact on both cost and risk. However, costs \n\nfluctuate (usually upward) throughout a program. Increased cost is frequently justifi-\nable, but can also be due to unnecessary engineering changes, schedule slips, and \n\n23.1 Applying SMAD to Later Mission Phases 885 \n\nchanges in the funding profile. Thus, we would like to apply the SMAD process \nthroughout the mission life cycle to reduce, or at least contain, program cost and risk. \nThis process is summarized below and described in more detail in Wertz and Larson \n[19%], Chap. 10. \n\nTable 23-2 summarizes how to keep down cost and risk, but these steps can conflict \nwith how space programs are typically run. Good mission engineering demands that \nwe regularly review and consider revising mission objectives, requirements, and \napproaches. However, this review may make the program seem unstable. We might \nask, ''Why are we looking at our mission objectives and requirements again? We have \nalready done that and now must build the system.\" We must do so because programs \nand mission designs must mature and adapt to new conditions. Thus our concept of \noperations, approach, and goals must also evolve. \n\nTABLE 23-2. Mission Engineering ActlvHJes Needed Throughout the Mission life.

Control system-level trades and Allows trade between elements and applying \nbudgets within the systems margin to different elements as needed \nengineering group \n\n6. Update analysis of mission utility Necessary to keep program sold In a strongly \ncompetitive, cost-conscious environment \n\nA major part of doing our job better is to identify the right issues and look for key \nalternatives to investigate. Working the wrong issues can be costly. For example, early \nin the U.S. space prograln, scientists and engineers were trying to figure out how to \nhandle the enormous heat generated during reentry into the atmosphere. At fIrst the \nproblem statement was, \"Find a material that will withstand a temperature of \n14,000 OF for 5 minutes.\" Much time and money were spent trying to solve this \nproblem even though no known material could withstand the required temperature. \nFinally, someone recognized that the problem would be restated as, ''Find a way to \nprotect a capsule and the person inside during reentry.\" Ablative materials quickly \nsolved this problem. The moral of this story is to make certain you are worlcing the \nright problems and asking the right questions throughout the program. \n\nReturning to see whether we are meeting basic mission objectives does not mean \nwe will change the concept of operations 2 months before launch. The further, a pr0-\ngram has evolved, the more it takes to justify fundamental changes. Still, if a new tech-\nnology or concept of operations can reduce mission cost, risk, and schedule, we should \nevaluate and use it if it is worthwhile. As the program evolves, the cost of imple-\nmenting change becomes greater and the benefit decreases because other parts of the . \nmission have been designed to work as originally intended. Nonetheless, changes late \nin the program may provide equal or better performance at less cost and risk. \n\n\n\n886 Applying the Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 23.1 \n\nAlthough reevaluating mission objectives may appear to jeopardize a program. the \nresult becomes stronger and sounder. We could keep the same mission concept \nthroughout. but a far better approach is to formally review mission requirements at the \nbeginning of each mission phase. This review tells us where the program is going and \nwhy. At the same time. it allows us to resolve these issues by the end of each mission \nphase to maintain program stability within a highly competitive environment \n\nSecondly. we must keep the program flexible by assigning economic value to \nsystem flexibility. All too often. a program quickly becomes rigid by trying to \noptimize the meeting of narrow requirements for the current mission design. Thus. \nchanging mission objectives or technology is difficult Hewing to fixed requirements \nmay reduce cost for a small. short-turnaround. unique mission. but is unlikely to \nsucceed for larger-scale activities. For example. geosynchronous satellites should be, \nand usually are, designed to work in multiple slots so we can move them from one \nposition to another. Expressed differently. the mission design as well as the design of \nthe elements should be robust. i.e., stable in the presence of unknown perturbations. \nWe need robust or flexible designs to help minimize the cost and risk of unforeseen \nyet inevitable changes in mission objectives and requirements. \n\nOne way to make a system more flexible is to carry out as many onboard tasks as \npossible in software and ensure we can reprogram the software from the ground. Now \nthat we have more sophisticated processors and greater onboard memory, we-can cre-\nate very flexible satellites without driving up cost and weight This allows us to both \ncorrect design flaws on orbit and respond to changing mission needs and conditions. \n\nToo often, programs attempt to reduce risk by flying only components which have \nflown before. Many subcontractors change their design only when manufacturers stop \nmaking particular parts and components. A far better approach is be to allow some per-\nformance margin and then use modem .technology to achieve the needed performance \nat lower weight. cost. and risk. As Chap. 20 outlines, we also make an informed \nassessment of the Technology Readiness Level of a particular approach, assign it a \ndocumented risk factor. and feed that information into the decision-making process. \n\nAn excellent approach to minimizing the risk of new technology has been used \nsuccessfully by Surrey Space Technology Laboratory, Ltd. on a sequence of missions. \nAs shown in Fig. 23-1, Surrey continually flies both an older, space-proven computer \nand a newer, more powerful one. This approach allows Surrey to have both a conser-\nvative flight-proven design to ensure mission success. while at the same time flying \nsome of the newest. most capable processors in space. \n\nKeeping the Program Sold \nHistory has shown that space programs can be cancelled in virtually any \n\nphase-during conceptual design, during development and construction, after the first \none or two launches. or in mid-life while the spacecraft is still operating on orbit. The \nmessage is clear: if the program is worth doing, we must keep the program sold \nthroughout its mission life. Doing so is straightforward.We must analyze mission \nutility and trade cost against performance over the entire mission. We must also \nmaintain' a clear. easy-ta-understand and consistent rationale for mission objectives, \nrequirements and design decisions. At any time. we should be able to present a cost vs. \nperformance analysis and demonstrate to those who are funding it the benefits of \nhaving the program proceed. \n\nMaintaining an ongoing mission utility analysis capability means that we should \nalways be aware of the fundamental mission objectives and how well they are being \n\n23.1 \n\nUoSAT-1 \nUoSAT-2 \nUoSAT-3 \n\nUoSAT-5 \nKITSAT-1 \n\n580fT \nPoSAT-1 \nHealthsat-1 \n\nCERISE \nFASat-Aipha \n\nApplying SMAD to Later Mission Phases \n\nGeneral-Purpose Processors \n1802 Z80 8OC186 \n\n887 \n\n8OC386 \n\nFig. 23-1.

Each generation of spacecraft typically files the old s1andard, \nplus a new design which In tum becomes the next s1andard. (From Ward and Price, \nSec. 13.4 In Wertz and Larson [1996].) \n\nmet Thus. the mission objectives become important not only in the continuing design \nof the program, but also in keeping it alive. \n\nSystem Engineering Over the Life Cycle \nStrong system and mission engineering should be maintained throughout the life of \n\nthe program: trading on requirements, reevaluating the basic mission concept. and \nevaluating alternatives and mission utility. Otherwise the program may not continue. \n\nOverall. mission engineering later in the program should proceed as outlined in \nearlier chapters. At all levels. requirements should reflect what to do rather than how \nto do it We want to let technology flow up and into the program where it can do the \nmost good for cost. risk utility. or operations. We are unlikely to achieve the mission \nperformance at minimum cost and risk by limiting ourselves to the technologies and \napproaches from the concept-design team. \n\nA key element in mission engineering is to document the main system trades and. \nespecially, the reasons for choices. Unfortunately, specifications demand only that \nyou state what the system must do, how well it must be done, and how to verify that it \nmeets the requirement They do not ask you to say why you have chosen the require-\nments. However. requirements are intended to quantify the trade between what we \nwould like to achieve and what is possible within the established budget Thus, we \nshould document as fully as possible the reasons for these trades and requirements so \nwe can effectively revisit them during mission utility assessments and regular require-\nment reviews. \n\nOne way to initially reduce cost and schedule is to minimize the upfront engi-\nneering on the program. \"Shoot the engineers and get on with the program.\" can get \nprograms moving and contain growing engineering costs. This approach has some \ngood features. We do not want to spend excessive time optimizing a strawman design \nthat will change drastically at a later date. We also do not want to develop too much \ndetail in. the conceptual design. These activities divert resources from the more \nimportant. to~level mission trades. At the same time. we must have enough upfront \nsystem engineering as well as initial and continuing trades on objectives and mission \n\n~ \nII , \n\n\n\n888 Applying the Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 23.2 \n\nutility. There is no substitute for these activities-ignorance does not improve system \nperformance. \n\n23.2 Lessons Learned from Existing Space Programs \n\nFor the most part, the existing space mission analysis and design process works \nwell: trade-offs among technical alternatives in essentially all areas bring positive \nresults. But in our experience there are four common pitfalls in the front-end planning \nof space missions: \n\n\u2022 Disregarding or failing to understand the needs of opemtors, users, and devel-\nopers during the early phase of design \n\n\u2022 Failing to tmde on requirements \n\n\u2022 Constmining trades to too Iowa level too early \n\n\u2022 Postponing or avoiding assessment of alternatives \n\nInappropriate results such as higher cost or reduced performance usually result from \nthe acquisition process and organizational structure mther than from incorrect trade-\noff decisions. Occasionally, parochial views and politics keep the players from \ninremcting in a way that fosters good upfront design and development of the space \nmission. Designing the mission opemtions concept. generating requirements, and \nperforming early tmdes without taking into account the needs of the users, opemtors \nand developers can doom a progmm to failure from the beginning. A key to success is \nto foster continuous and open communications between the players. This can be an up-\nhill battle involving multiple organizations and possibly multiple nations, but it must \n-be done. \n\nThe space mission concept and requirements drive any progmm, so users, opemtors \nand developers of the system must work together to identify credible, cost-effective \nmission approaches. Once requirements are defined, organizations often go to great \nlengths and expense to meet them because they do not want to be unresponsive or to \nsay a given requirement is difficult This can unnecessarily drive up cost. Table 23-3 \nshows steps that can help solve this problem. \n\nTABLE 23-3. Steps to Help Alleviate the Problem of Failing to Trade on Requirements. \n\n1.

Early in a progmm we commonly \ndo tmdes like altitude vs. resolution and covemge but ignore trades between system \nelements (see Fig. 1-3). We should look for cost-effective tmde-offs among the \nelements such as shifting capability from the launch vehicle to the spacecraft or from \nthe spacecmft to the ground segment. For example, we can move more computing and \n\n23.3 Future Trends \n\ndata processing from the ground station to the spacecmft for autonomous navigation. \nThe question is, should we provide a spacecraft which can determine its position and \nvelocity on board and remove the interface to the ground? This could increase the cost \nof spacecraft development but save a great deal in opemtions cost by reducing the \nground system's need to tmck the spacecraft. process data. and provide spacecraft \nephemeris. This is a politically sensitive trade because it takes money and responsi-\nbility away from the ground element and gives them to the space element This can \nresult in a turfbattle where decisions are made on the basis of who controls the budget. \nmther than on what provides the best results at the lowest cost \n\nTwo positive steps can help reduce these problems: \n\n\u2022 Look explicitly for tmdes between system elements \n\n\u2022 Do these tmdes as early as possible, before organizational structure and poli-\ntics rule out major options \n\nLook at the result of these tmdes carefully. For example, when someone presents an \nextremely low-cost spacecraft concept with minimal capability, look for higher costs \nin other mission elements. \n\nWe often postpone or avoid assessing major alternatives for space progmms. We \ndo so to meet tight bridget constraints, to keep the progmm appearing stable, and to \navoid reducing the momentum to proceed. As we know, change costs much more as a \nprogmm proceeds. Change during concept explomtion may do little or nothing to \nengineering cost, whereas changes during the definition phase involve more people \nand a reassessment of a more detailed design. Design changes involve formal \npaperwork and change controls. Changing anything once the hardware is in production \ncan dmmatically increase cost. It is more cost-effective to make changes as early as \npossible. \n\n23.3 Future Trends \n\nIn several respects, we expect more changes in the way that space progmms are \nconducted over the coming decade than have occurred since the start of the space \nprogram. * In the near tellIl. three distinct trends are apparent: \n\n\u2022 Increased political and economic constraints driving the industry toward \nlower-cost space missions and increased inter-organizational and international \ncoopemtion \n\n\u2022 More reliance on advanced spacecraft processing \n\n\u2022 The introduction of large constellations and, consequently, a more manufac-\nturing approach to spacecmft design \n\nBecause of budget constraints on the space program as a whole, we expect a \ncontinuing strong emphasis on lower costs for spacecraft and space missions.

As descnOed in Chap. 22, \nthe technologies used here tend to be nontraditional and far less expensive. LightSats \nrepresent a new way of doing business in space that, if correctly exploited, can drive \ndown costs by a factor of 2 to 10 with respect to more traditional programs [Wertz and \nLarson, 1996]. \n\nThe biggest technical change in space missions will be the increased use of onboard \nprocessing. Space computers are emerging from infancy, with full-fledged, general-\npurpose processors now becoming available. We will use them much more as they \nbecome more economical and begin to duplicate some of the ground processing capa\": \n\n. bility. As onboard processing increases, spacecraft will take on more complex tasks \nand become more autonomous. \n\nIncreases in spacecraft autonomy could drive costs either up or down, depending \non the community's approach to autonomy and sOftware development. We strongly \nrecommend using software to help lower costs. As shown in Table 23-4, we believe \nautonomy in moderation can reduce cost and risk by automating repetitive functions \non the spacecraft while leaving the higher-level functions to ground operations. Every-\nday tasks such as telemetry processing, attitude control, and orbit control should be \ndone autonomously on board, with all of the relevant information attached to the \npayload data for downlink to the ground. On the other hand, tryingto fully automate \nproblem solving can be dramatically expensive. So long as the spacecraft is capable of \nputting itself in a fail-safe mode, this work is best performed on the ground where \noperators can do what they do best-use their intelligence to understand, resolve, and \nrepair spacecraft problems and respond to changing circumstances. \n\nTABLE 23-4. Development of Low-Cost, Autonomous Systems. The objective of \"autonomy \nin rnoderatione is to automate repetitive tasks and spacecraft sating whOe allowing \npeople to identify and fix problems and create long-term plans [Wertz and Larson, \n19961. \n\nFunctions That Should Be Automated Functions That Should Not Be Automated \n\n\u2022 Attitude determination and control \u2022 Problem resolution \n\u2022 Orbit determination and control \u2022 Identification and implementation of fixes \n\u2022 Payload data processing \u2022 One-tima activities (e.g., deployment and \n\u2022 Repetitive housekeeping, e.g., battery check-out) \n\ncharging, active thermal control \u2022 Long term operations planning \n\u2022 Anomaly recognition \u2022 Emergency handling beyond sating \n\n\u2022 Spacecraft sating \n\nWe do not know if proposals to drive down launch costs will succeed in the coming \ndecade. If launch costs drop significantly, low-cost satellite systems will be possible. \nReducing launch costs will itself drive down spacecraft cost because it will no longer \nbe worth as much to optimize the spacecraft design or minimize weight [Wertz and \nLarson, 1996]. Costs for space exploration would become more consistent with avia-\ntion and other commercial activities. \n\nWe also expect to see significant changes in space payloads, due both to the \nincreased level of processing and other factors. In observations and communications, \n\n23.3 Future Trends 891 \n\nthe use of increased processing capability and array sensors for observations will \ngreatly increase the capacity of small spacecraft. In addition, a number of new types \nof space missions will begin, most notably materials processing in space and other \napplications of a microgravity environment. This area is just now beginning and bas \nenormous growth potential as low-gravity manufacturing processes become better \nunderstood. Much of this will require low-cost access to space and the return of \npayloads from space as well. \n\nThe commercial communications constellations have also had a major impact on \nthe process of designing and manufacturing spacecraft [Logsdon, 1995]. Commercial \ngeosynchronous spacecraft have been manufactured in an assembly line process for \nsome time. Nonetheless, low-Earth orbit constellations require that the entire constel-\nlation be built and launched in a short time in order to allow the system to begin \nservicing customers. For example, the Iridium constellation of 66 satellites was \nlaunched in slightly over a year which required satellites to be coming off the assembly \nline at an average rate of approximately one per week. This significantly changes the \nfocus of spacecraft design from performance optimization to high-reliability manufac-\nturing. The two contrasting approaches are presented in Chaps. 12 and 19 above. To \nthe extent that these manufacturing techniques can be applied to other space missions \nas well, this should continue to reduce the cost, risk, and schedule of spacecraft devel-\nopment. The application of this to spacecraft components is discussed by Zafanella \n[1998]. . \n\nIn addition, new constellations like Iridium, Celestri, Globalstar and even the eXiSt-\ning GPS, provide an unprecedented infrastructure that can be used to create new and \nmore cost-effective space mission architectures. For example having an abundance of \nbandwidth available in space can facilitate the movement of data around the world, \nthus alleviating the current problems we have with over-subscribed networks, and \nchanging the way we do missions. . . . \n\nSince the first satellites, space has moved from a very novel actiVIty to a routine \ncommercial enterprise. Today, on the average, Americans use some form of space as-\nset many times per day-weather, television, telephones, navigation, Internet, and \nmore. Companies are looking for ways to use space and space-related assets to ~velop \nand provide highly marketable products and services. More than ever, compames are \nfocusing on the end-to-end perspective-providing customers what they need in a \nmore cost-effective way. For example, recent deregulation of electric utilities in North \nAmerica has resulted in regional utilities trying to sell their electricity all over the con-\ntinent. One severe problem they face is how to keep track of the customers' use of elec-\ntricity, which has prompted the need for a method of automatically reading utility \nmeters continentally-from space. The commercial space systems we propose must be \nrelevant and financially viable, while government space systems must be relevant and \ncost-effective. \n\nToday, space exploration depends more on policy, politics, and economics, than ~ \ntechnological limits. Virtually any mission is now technically possible. We can build \na lunar base send humans to Mars, develop space colonies and huge solar-powered \nsatellites, or'send manned or unmanned probes to the outer planets. Our limitations are \nset by what we choose to do or what we can afford. As environmental problems \nbecome more serious on the Earth's surface, intelligently using space will become \nmore important. Yet the use of space resources cannot grow unless we can de~\u00ad\nstrate that we are becoming more efficient and cost effective in our use of space. This \nis the challenge for space in the early 21st century. \n\n\n\nApplying the Space Mission Analysis and Design Process 23.3 \n\nReferences \n\nButler, George V., ed. 1990.

However ,latitude and longitude are frequently given in geodetic coordi-\nnates which are defined with respect to an oblate reference ellipsoid (i.e .\u2022 a figure \ncreated by rotating an ellipse about its minor axis). with the height, h, measured per-\npendicular to a plane tangent to the ellipsoid. A triaxial ellipsoid is not generally used \nsince the gain in representation is small. Although not normally used for space mission \nwork, astronomical latitude and longitude are defined relative to the local vertical, or \nthe normal to the equipotential surface of the Earth. Thus, astronomical latitude is \ndefined as the angle betWeen the local vertical and the Earth's equatorial plane. Max-\nimum values of the deviation of the vertical, or the angle between the local vertical and \nthe normal to a reference ellipsoid, are about 1 minute of arc. Maximum variations in \nthe height between the ellipsoid and mean sea level (also called the equipotential \nsurface) are about 100 m. Seidelmann [1992] provides an extended discussion of \ncoordinate systems and transformations. \n\nAxis of Rotation \n\nPolar c \nRadius \n\nFig. B-1. Geocentric vs. Geodetic Coordinates. \n\nTangent to \nEllipse at p' \n\n\n\n900 AppendixB \n\nThe geocentric latitude, ~~ of a point, p, on the surface of the Earth is the angle at \nthe Earth's center between p and the equatorial plane. The geodetic or geographic lat-\nitude, fI, is the angle between the normal to the reference ellipsoid (at point p') and the \nequatorial plane. The ellipsoid is typically defined by the flattening./. or the inverse. \nflattening, 1/f, given by \n\na-b \nf = -- '\" 1/298.256 42 for the Earth \n\na (B-2) \n\nwhere a and b are the semimajor and semiminor axes of the ellipsoid. \nThe geocentric longitude, A, is defined by the angle between the reference (or zero) \n\nmeridian and the meridian of point p (and p'). measured eastward around the Earth \nfrom 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0. The geodetic longitude will be identical to the geocentric longitude \nassuming that the reference ellipsoid has the same axes and reference meridian as the \ngeocentric system. \n\n. The ellipsoidal height, h, of point p is measured along the normal to the ellipse, and \nWith respect to the point of intersection of that normal with the ellipsoidal surface, that \nis, from pointp'. Other 'heights' are possible-for example, the geocentric radius, r, \nand the height above mean sea level or geoidal height, H. \n\nWe often express the position of a point, p, on or near the Earth in a right-handed \ngeocentric cartesian coordinate system (X, Y, Z). Here the direction of the Z-axis is \nthat of the rotational reference ellipsoid, the X-axis is perpendicular to Z through the \nreference meridian. The Y-axis completes the triplet in a right-handed sense. \n\nConversion from geocentric to geocentric c~ian coordinates is given by \n\n[~l = {::::: :~:~l \nZ p sinl/J' \n\nConversion from geodetic to geocentric cartesian coordinates is given by \n\n[~l = l \\~ :4:::~] \nZ p ((I-e\n\n2 )N; +h)sin~ \nwhere e is the eccentricity of the ellipsoid \n\ne= ~a2 _b2 /a = ~2f - f2 \n\nand NIP is the ellipsoidal radius of curvature in the meridian, given by \n\nN~ =a/~I-e2sin2~ \nConversion from geocentric cartesian to geocentric coordinates is given by \n\ntan-I( Z/~X2 + y2) \ntan-I(y IX) [n = \n\np \n\n(B-3) \n\n(B-4) \n\n(B-5) \n\n(B-6) \n\n(B-7) \n\nAstronautical and Astrophysical Data 901 \n\nNote that f/I = sin-I (ZI r) may also be used to determine f/I, and that these functions \nare evaluated sUch that-90\u00b0 ~4 S+90\u00b0, and 0\u00b0 SAS36O\u00b0. \n\nTo convert from geocentric cartesian to geodetic coordinates is not as simple a pro-\ncedure. An exact solution has been given by Borkowski [1989) based on using an \nexpression for the reduced latitude in a solvable fourth-degree polynomial. \n\nWe first calculate intermediate variables as follcws: \n\nR=~X2 +y2 \n\nE~[bZ-(a2 -b2)VaR \nQ=2(E2_F2) \n\nD=(p3 +~)1/2 \n\nF=[bZ+(a2 -b2)VaR v = {D_Q}1f3 _{D+Q)1f3 \n\nP=4(EF+l)/3 G=~[ ~E2 +v +E] \n\nt=[G2 +(F-vG)/(2G-E)f -G \n\nFinally, the latitude and ellipsoidal height are computed from: \n\ntP = tan-1(a(l- t2)1 (2bt\u00bb) \nh = (R - at) cos tP + (Z - b)sintP (B-8) \n\nTo obtain the correct sign, set the sign of b to that of Z before beginning.

D.I General Formulas \n\nThis appendix provides a summary of basic rules. More detailed discussions are \nprovided by Green [1985), Smart [1977), and Newcomb [1960). Wertz [2001) pro-\nvides a detailed discussion of global geometry and its application to problems of space \nmission analysis, including a discussion of \"full-sky\" techniques that eliminate the \nquadrant ambiguities which make automated spherical geometry solutions complex \nand inconvenient \n\nA right spherical triangle is one with at least one right angle. (Unlike plane trian-\ngles, spherical triangles can have 1, 2, or 3 right angles.) Any two of the remaining \ncomponents, including the two remaining angles, serve to completely define the trian-\ngle. Napier's Rules, given in any of the above books, provide a concise formulation \nfor all possible right spherical triangles. However, experience has shown that it is \nsubstantially more convenient to write out explicitly the rules for the relatively small \nnumber of possible combinations of known and unknown sides and angles. These are \nlisted in Table D-1. \n\nA quadrantal spherical triangle is one with at least one side which is 90 deg in \nlength. As with right spherical triangles, any two of the remaining five components \ncompletely define the triangle. These are given by a corresponding set of Napier's \nRules. Again, it is more practical to write out explicitly all possible relationships. \nThese are given in Table D-2. \n\nAn oblique spherical triangle has arbitrary sides and angles. Sides and angles are \ngenerally defined over the range of 0 to 180 deg, although most of the spherical geom-\netry relations continue to hold in the angular range up to 360 deg. A set of basic rules \nwhich can be applied to any spherical triangle are given in Table D-3. Finally, these \ngeneral rules can be used to write explicit expressions for any of the unknown compo-\nnents in any oblique spherical triangle with any three components known. These are \ngiven in full by Wertz [2001). \n\nReferences \nGreen, Robin M. 1985. Spherical Astronomy. Cambridge: Cambridge University \n\nPress. \n\nNewoomb,Simon. 1960.

The albedo geometrY \nfactor IS a ~Ction of 1'/, H,.Q, and O. As shown in Fig. D-l,.Q is the rotation angle \nabout the nadir vector from the Sun to N. (Because it is a rotation angle, it is the same \nangle whether measured on the spacecraft or on the Earth's surface.) 0 is the Earth \ncentral angle from the Sun to the spacecraft which, to the accuracy of the thermal \ncomputations, is equal to 180 deg minus the angle at the spacecraft from the Sun to \nnadir. \n\nOrbit \n\nRg. 0-1. Computation of Inputs to be Used In Determining the Thermal GeOmetry Factors. \nSee text for discussion. \n\nFor an Earth-oriented spacecraft, the nadir angle, 1'/, is known or can be computed by \nany of the methods in Sees. 5.1 and 5.2. The Earth central angle from the Sun to the \nspacecraft, 0, is given by: \n\ncos (180 deg - (J) = - cos 0 = cos AzslUI cos Ps (0-1) \nwhere ,,~ZS/Ul is the azimuth of the Sun relative to nadir and f3s, often called the \"~ \nangle, IS the angle of the Sun out of the orbit plane. The rotation angle .0 is then given \nby: \n\nn cosf3N +cosOcos1'/ cos .... = -...:....:..::--::-:-----=-\nsinOsin 1'/ (0-2) \n\nwhere f3N is the angle from the Sun to the normal, N, to the plate in question. (See \nSec. 5.1.) \n\nSpherieal Geometry \n\nFor planets other than the Earth, the same geometry factors can be used with the \nplanetary albedo and thermal IR characteristics from Table 11-46. The altitudes listed \nin Table D-l should be interpreted as the altitudes proportional to the planetary radius. \nThus, in Table D-l, the data for 500 km altitude corresponds to 0.0784 RE, where RE \nis the Earth's equatorial radius of 6,378.14 km. For Mars with an equatorial radius of \n3,397 km, the data for 500 km in Table D-l corresponds to an altitude above Mars of \n3397 x 0.0784 = 266 km. \n\nTABLE 0-4.

Wertz, Microcosm, Inc. \n\nCalendar time in the uSual form of date and time is used only for input and output. \nbecause arithmetic is cumbersome in months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. \nNonetheless, this is used for most human interaction with space systems because it's \nthe system with which we are most familiar. Even with date and time systems, \nproblems can arise, because time zones are different throughout the world and \nspacecraft operations typically involve a worldwide network. The uniformly adopted \nsolution to this problem is to use the local standard time corresponding to 0 deg \nlongitude (i.e., the Greenwich meridian) as the assigned time for events anywhere in \nthe world or in space. This is referred to as Universal Time (UT), Greenwich Mean \nTime (GMT), or Zulu (Z), all of which are equivalent for most practical spacecraft \noperations. The name Greenwich Mean Time is used because 0 deg longitude is \ndefined by the site of the former Royal Greenwich Observatory in metropolitan \nLondon. \n\nCivil time, Tcivil> as measured by a standard wall clock or time signals, differs from \nUniversal Time by an integral number of hours, corresponding approximately to the \nlongitude of the observer. The approximate relation is: \n\nTcivil = UT \u00b1 (L + 7.5)115 (E-l) \n\nwhere Tcivil and UT are in hours, and L is the longitude in degrees with the plus sign \ncorresponding to East longitude and the minus sign corresponding to West longitude. \nThe conversion between civil time and Universal Time for most North American and \nEuropean time zones is given in Table E-L Substantial variations in time zones are \ncreated for political convenience. In addition, most of the United States and Canada \nobserve Daylight Savings Time from the first Sunday in April until the last Sunday in \nOctober. Most European countries observe daylight savings time (called \"summer \ntime\") from the last Sunday in March to the first Sunday in October. Many countries \nin the southern hemisphere also maintain daylight savings time, typically from \nOctober to March. Countries near the equator typically do not deviate from standard \ntime. \n\nCalendar time is remarkably inconvenient for computation, particularly over long \ntime intervals of months or years. We need an absolute time that is a continuous count \nof time units from some arbitrary reference. The time interval between any two events \nmay then be found by simply subtracting the absolute time of the second event from \nthat of the first. The universally adopted solution for astronomical problems is the \nJulian Day, ill, a continuous count of the number of days since Greenwich noon \n(12:00 un on January 1,4713 BC'\", or, as astronome.rs now say, -4712. Because \nJulian Days start at noon UT, they will be a half day off with respect to civil dates. \nWhile this is inconvenient for transforming from civil dales to Julian dates, it was \nusefuIfor astronomers because the date didn't change in the middle of the night (for \nEuropean observers). \n\n\n\n--------------= ~-- --- -- -\nT \n\n914 AppendixE \n\nTABLE E-1. nme Zones In North America, Europe, and Japan.

Table E-2 lists the Julian Dates at the beginning of each year from 1990 \nthrough 2031. To find the Julian Date for any given calendar date, simply add the day \nnumber within the year (and fractional day number, if appropriate) to the Julian Date \nfor Jan 0.0 of that year from Table E-2. Day numbers for each day of the year are on \nmany calendars or can be found by adding the date to the day number for day 0 of the \nmonth from Table E-3. Thus 18:00 UT on April 15, 2002 = day number 15.75 + 90 = \n105.75 in 2002 = JD 105.75 + 2,452,2745 = JD 2,452,380.25. \n\nTo convert from Julian Days to dates, determine the year in which the Julian Date \nfalls from Table E-2. Subtract the Julian Date from the JD for January 0.0 of that year \nto determine the day number within the year. This can be converted to a date (and time, \nif appropriate) by using day numbers on a calendar or subtracting from the day number \nfor the beginning of the appropriate month from Table E-3. Thus, from Table E-2, \nJD 2,451,608.25 is in the year 2000. The day number is 2,451,608.25 -2,451,543.5 = \n64.75. From Table E-3, this is 18:00 UT, March 4, 2000. \n\nSoftware Routines Using Integer Arithmetic \nA particularly clever procedure for finding the Julian Date, JD, associated with any \n\ncurrent year, Y, month, M, and day of the month, D, is given by Fliegel and Van \n\n* This strange starting point was suggested by an Italian scholar of Greek and Hebrew, Joseph \nScaliger, in 1582 as the beginning of the current Julian period of 7,980 years. This period is \nthe product of three numbers: the solar cycle, or the interval at which all dates recur on the \nsame days of the week (28 years); the lunar cycle, containing an integral number of lunar \nmonths (19 years); and the indiction or the tax period introduced by the Emperor Constantine \nin 313 AD (15 years). The last time that these started together was 4713 BC and the next time \nwill be 3267 AD. Scaliger was interested in reducing the astronomical dating problems ass0-\nciated with calendar reforms of his time and his proposal had the convenient selling point that \nit pre-dated the ecclesiastically approved date of creation, October 4, 4004 BC. \n\nUniversal Time and JuHan Dates 915 \n\nTABLE E-2.

Thus, December 25, 2007 falls on Tuesday. \n\nSoftware Routines Without Integer Arithmetic \nWhile most computer languages provide integer arithmetic, spreadsheets such as \n\nExcel or MatLab typically do not. (See below for use of Excel and MatLab DATE \nfunctions.) Similar capabilities are available using integer (!NT) or truncation \n(TRUNC in Excel, FIX in MatLab) functions. INT and lRUNC are identical for \npositive numbers, but differ for negative numbers: INT(-3.1) = -4. whereas \nlRUNC(-3.1) = -3. It is the lRUNC or FIX function which is equivalent to integer \n\nUniversal Time and Julian Dates 917 \n\narithmetic. Thus, using the same variables as above, we can rewrite Eqs. (E-2) for \ncomputation of JD from the date as: \n\nC = lRUNC\u00abM - 14)112) \n\nJD(). = D - 32,075 + lRUNC(l,461 x (Y + 4,800 + C)/4) \n+ lRUNC(367 x (M - 2 - C x 12)/12) \n-lRUNC(3 x (TRUNC(Y + 4,900 + C) 1100) 14) \n\nJD = IDo + F - 0.5 \n\n(E-5a) \n\n(E-Sb) \n\n(E-5c) \n\nwhere again JDo. Y, M, D, and C are integers and F and JD are real numbers. Applying \nthe same rules to Eq. (E-3) gives the inverse formula for the date in terms of JD as: \n\nL = ID + 68,569 \n\nN = lRUNC\u00ab4 x L) 1146,097) \n\nL = L -lRUNC\u00ab 146097 x N + 3) 14) \n\n1= lRUNC\u00ab4000 x (L + 1\u00bb 11,461,001) \n\nL = L -lRUNC\u00abI,461 x I) 14) + 31 \n\nJ = lRUNC\u00ab80 x L) 12,447) \n\nD = L -lRUNC\u00ab2,447 x J) I 80) \n\nL = lRUNC(J 111) \n\nM=J+2-12xL \n\nY= l00x(N-49)+I+L \n\n(E-6a) \n\n(E-6b) \n\n(E-6c) \n\n(E-6d) \n\n(E-6e) \n\n(E-6t) \n\n(E-6g) \n\n(E-6h) \n\n(E-6i) \n\n(E-6j) \n\nwhere the variables are the same as Eq. (E-3), except that D is now a real number cor-\nresponding to the date and fraction of a day. Finally, Eq. (E-4) for the day of the week \nbecomes: \n\nW= JD -7 xlRUNC \u00abJD + 1.5) 17) + 2.5 \n= JD -7 x INT\u00abJD + 1.5) 17) + 25 (E-7) \n\nwhere 1 $ W < 2 corresponds to Sunday. The examples given above can also serve as \ntest cases for Eqs. (E-5), (E-6), and (E-7). \n\nModified JuHan Date \nThe Julian Date presents minor problems for space applications. Because it was \n\nintroduced principally for astronomical use, Julian Dates begin at 12:00 UT rather than \no hours UT, as the civil calendar does (thus the 0.5 day differences in Table E-2). In \naddition, the 7 digits required for the Julian Date did not permit the use of single \nprecision arithmetic in older computer programs. This is no longer a problem with \nmodern computer storage and number formats. Nonetheless, various forms of trun-\ncated Julian dates have gained at least some use. \n\nThe most common of the truncated Julian dates for astronomical and astronautics \nuse is the Modified Julian Date, MID, given by: \n\nMID = JD - 2,400,000.5 (E-8) \n\nMID'begins at midnight, to correspond with the civil calendar. Thus, in using \nTable E-2, the MID is given by adding the day of the year (plus fractions of a day, if \n\n\n\n918 AppendixE \n\nappropriate) to the number in the table, with the \".5\" at the end of the table-listing \ndropped. For example, theMJD for 18:00 UT on Jan. 3,2002 = MID 52,277.75. The \ndefinition of the MID given here is that adopted by the International Astronomical \nUnion in 1997. Note, however, that other definitions of the MID have been used. Thus, \nthe most unambiguous approach remains the use of the full Julian Date. \n\nSpreadsheets such as Excel or MatLab \n. Spreadsheets, such as Excel or MatLab, typically store dates internally as some \n\nform of day cOunt and allow arithmetic operations, such as subtraction. Thus, we can \neither subtract two dates directly to determine a time interval or convert them to Julian \nDates by simply finding the additive constant, K, given by: \n\nK=JD-I (E-9) \n\nwhere I is the internal number representing a known date, JD. Once this is determined, \nthen the JD for any date is: \n\nJD=K+ I (E-I0) \n\nMany versions of Excel use Jan. 1,1904, as \"day 0,\" such that KExcel = 2,416,480.5. \nHowever, this should be checked for individual programs because other starting points \nare sometimes used and the starting point is a variable parameter in some versions of \nExcel. While this can be a very convenient function. Excel date routines run only from \n1904 to 2078. \n\nMatLab typically uses Jan. 1, 0000, 0:0:0 as \"day 0.\" Thus, in the formula above, \nKMatLab = 1,721,058.5. \n\nAny of the day counting approaches will work successfully over its allowed range. \nHowever, systems intended for general mathematics or business use may not account \ncorrectly for leap years and calendar changes when historical times or times far in the \nfuture are being evaluated. Thus, the use of the full Julian Date remains the most \nunambiguous solution, particularly if a program or result is to be used by more than \none person or program.

By international agree-\nment, the fundamental SI units of length, mass, and time are defined as follows (see \nNational Institutes of Standards and Technology, Special Publication 330 [1991]): \n\nThe meter is the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a \ntime interval of 11299,792,458 of a second. \nThe kilogram is the mass of the international prototype of the kilogram. \nThe second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation \ncorresponding to the transition between two hyperfme levels of the \nground state of the cesium-133 atom. \n\nAdditional base units in the SI system are the ampere for electric current, the kelvin \nfor thermodynamic temperature, the mole for amount of substance, and the candela for \nluminous intensity. Taylor [1995] provides an excellent summary of SI units for \nscientific and technical use. \n\nThe names of multiples and submultiples of SI units are formed by application of \nthe following prefixes: \n\nFactor by WhIch Factor by WhIch \nUnit Is MulUpllec:I Prefix Symbol Unit Is MulUpllec:l PrefIx Symbol \n\n1()24 yetta Y 10-1 decl d \n1()21 zetta Z 10-2 cent!

Most of the conversions given \nhere are between SI and EMU (electromagnetic). The following equations hold in both \nsets of units: \n\n'T = mxB= dxH \n\nB = j.LII \nm = fA for a current loop in a plane \n\nd = J.IDl \nwith the following definitions: \n\nT == torque \nB == magnetic induction (commonly called \"magnetic field\") \nH == magnetic field strength or magnetic intensity \nm == magnetic'moment \n\nI == current loop \nA == vector normal to the plane of the current loop (in the direction of the angular \n\nvelocity vector of the current loop about the center of the loop) with magnitude \nequal to the area of the loop. ' \n\nd == magnetic dipole moment \n1.1 == magnetic permeability \n\nThe permeability of vacuum, !lo, has the following values, by definition: \n!lo= 1 (dimensionless) EMU \n\nJ.Io==41tx 10-7 N1A2 SI \n\nTherefore, in electromagnetic units in vacuum, magnetic induction and magnetic field strength \nare equivalent and the magnetic moment and magnetic dipole moment are equivalent.

Minimum Atmospheric Density (kglm3), from MSIS atmospheric moder \n[Hedin\"tt, 1987, 1988, and 1991]. The solar flux value, FlO.7, was chosen \nsuch that 10% of all measured data are less than this minimum (65.8 x 10-22 \nWom-2.Hz-l). See Sec. 8.1.3. The MSIS model is limited to the region \nbetween 90 and 2,000 kIn. Below 150 km and above 600 km the error \nincreases because less data have been used. All data have been averaged \nacross the Earth with a 30 deg step size in longitude and 20 deg steps in lati-\ntude (-80 deg, to +80 deg). This over-represents the Earth's polar regions; \nhowever, satellites spend a larger fraction of their time at high latitudes. The \nsolar hour angle was adapted to the individual location on the Earth with UT = \n12.00 Noon. \n\n27.

One Degree Field 0/ View Mapped onto the Earth's Surface at Nadir from \nAltitude h (km) = The length on the Earth's curved surface of a 1 deg arc \nprojected at nadir from this altitude. Note: This data is very nonlinear \n[Eqs. (5-26a), (5-26b), and (5-27)]. \n\n51. Range to Horizon (km) = same as col. 17 = (r2 - RE 2)112, where RE = \n6,378.14 km is the equatorial radius of the Earth. For the range to points other \nthan the true horizon (i.e., E*-O deg) use columns 18, 19, and 20 [Eq. (5-28)]. \n\n52. Period (min) = 1.658669 x 104 r312 = (1/60) x 2n (r3/Ji)II2.

Note that this \nis revolutions per sidereal day, where the sidereal day is the day relative to the \nfixed stars which is approximately 4 min shorter than the solar day of 1,440 \nmin. [Note: This is a correction to SMAD I and II (printings 1 through 4) \nwhere the revolutions per day were defined as here but the data was produced \nusing 1,440 min as the length of a day.] \n\n55. Node Spacing (deg) = 360 deg x (P /1,436.07), where P is from col. 52. This \nis the spacing in longitude between successive ascending or descending nodes \nfor a satellite in a circular orbit [Eq.
