I provided mission development or operation services to space missions\n\nthat traveled to all the eight planets, except Mercury. These missions furnish many\n\nof the examples of mission design and analysis and navigation activities that are\n\ndescribed in this text. The engineering experience at JPL has furnished the set of\n\ntechniques and tools for space missions that are the core of this textbook.\n\nI am an adjunct professor at USC, where I have taught a graduate course in\n\nOrbital Mechanics since 1979, plus three other graduate courses that I have initiated\n\nand developed. This teaching experience has enabled me to show that the\n\ntechniques and tools for space missions have been developed from the basic\n\nprinciples of Newton and Kepler. The book has been written from my class notes.\n\nSo, in a sense, I have been writing it for 35 years and I am very proud to see it in\n\nprint.\n\nThe reason for writing this book is to put the results from these experiences\n\ntogether in one presentation, which I will continue to use at USC and share with my\n\nstudents and colleagues. The reader can expect to find an organized and detailed\n\nstudy of the controlled flight paths of spacecraft, including especially the techniques\n\nand tools used in analyzing, designing, and navigating space missions.\n\nIn academia, this book will be used by graduate students to study Orbital\n\nMechanics or to do research in challenging endeavors such as the safe return of\n\nhumans to the moon. (See Chaps. 6 and 7.) It will also serve well as a textbook for\n\nan Orbital Mechanics course for upper-division undergraduate and other advanced\n\nundergraduate students. Professional engineers working on space missions and\n\npeople who are interested in learning how space missions are designed and\n\nnavigated will also use the book as a reference.\n\nvii\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_6\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_7\n\n\nThis presentation benefits significantly from the many references listed in the\n\nback of the book. The list includes excellent textbooks by Marshall H. Kaplan, John\n\nE. Prussing and Bruce A. Conway, Richard H. Battin, and others and a technical\n\nreport by Paul A. Penzo for the Apollo missions. Papers include those by Leon\n\nBlitzer, John E. Prussing, and Roger Broucke. Finally, there is the contribution of\n\nonline sources, such as Eric Weisstein\u2019s \u201cWorld of Scientific Biography,\u201d JPL\u2019s\n\nNear-Earth Objects and Solar System Dynamics, and the Rocket & Space Technol-\n\nogy websites. To all these sources and the many others cited in the text, I express\n\nmy gratitude.\n\nMy gratitude is also extended to my wife, Mary Louise Hintz, and our three\n\nchildren, JJ, Tana, and Kristin, for their support.\n\nLos Angeles, CA, USA Gerald R.

The study starts from basic principles\n\nderived empirically by Isaac Newton, that is, Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion, which\n\nwere derived from experience or observation. Thus, we develop the relative 2-body\n\nmodel consisting of two particles, where one particle is more massive (the central\n\nbody) and the other (the spacecraft) moves about the first, and the only forces acting\n\non this system are the mutual gravitational forces. Kepler\u2019s Laws of Motion are\n\nproved from Newton\u2019s Laws. Solving the resulting equations of motion shows that\n\nthe less-massive particle moves in a conic section orbit, i.e., a circle, ellipse,\n\nparabola, or hyperbola, while satisfying Kepler\u2019s Equation. Geometric properties\n\nof conic section orbits, orbit classification, and types of orbits are considered with\n\nexamples. Astronomical constants needed in this study are supplied, together with\n\nseveral tables of geometric formulas for elliptic orbits.\n\nAfter the orbit determination analyst estimates the spacecraft\u2019s orbit, trajectory\n\ncorrection maneuvers (TCMs) are designed to correct that estimated orbit to the\n\nbaseline that satisfies mission and operational requirements and constraints. Such\n\nTCMs correct statistical (usually small) errors, while other maneuvers make\n\nadjustments (usually large) such as insertion of the spacecraft into an orbit about\n\na planet from a heliocentric trajectory. Maneuver strategies considered include the\n\noptimal 2-maneuver Hohmann transfer and the optimal 3-maneuver bi-elliptic\n\ntransfer with examples for comparison purposes. The design of TCMs determines\n\nthe amount of velocity change required to correct the trajectory. The Rocket\n\nEquation is then used to determine the amount of propellant required to achieve\n\nthe required change in velocity. Various fuel and oxidizer combinations are consid-\n\nered that generate the specific impulse, the measure of a propellant\u2019s capability,\n\nrequired to implement the orbit correction.\n\nGravity assists obtained when flying by planets in flight to the target body\n\n(another planet, comet or asteroid, or the sun) can produce a large velocity change\n\nwith no expenditure of onboard propellant. Types and examples of interplanetary\n\nmissions and the targeting space used in designing the required trajectories are\n\ndescribed.\n\nTechniques of Astrodynamics include algorithms for propagating the\n\nspacecraft\u2019s trajectory, Keplerian orbit elements which describe the orbit\u2019s size,\n\nxv\n\n\n\nshape, and orientation in space and the spacecraft\u2019s location in the orbit, and\n\nLambert\u2019s Problem, which is used to generate mission design curves called \u201cpork\n\nchop plots\u201d. Other models advance our study to treat n bodies and distributed\n\nmasses instead of just two point masses, and measure time, which is fundamental\n\nto our equations.\n\nNon-Keplerian motion takes into account perturbations to the Keplerian model,\n\nsuch as oblateness of the central body, gravitational forces of other bodies (\u201c3rd\n\nbody effects\u201d), solar wind and pressure, and attitude correction maneuvers. The\n\nstudy identifies the primary perturbations for an earth-orbiting vehicle, resolves a\n\nsatellite orbit paradox, and considers \u201czero G\u201d (or is it \u201czero W\u201d?).\n\nA strategy for rendezvousing a spacecraft with other vehicles such as the\n\nInternational Space Station is described with examples. One example is rendezvous\n\nof the Apollo 11 Lunar Excursion Module with the CommandModule. One strategy\n\nis intended to avoid an unintentional rendezvous by placing the spacecraft in a\n\nstandoff position with respect to another vehicle to, for example, allow the\n\nastronauts to sleep in safety.\n\nNavigation techniques and tools include a TCM design tool and two methods for\n\ndesigning free-return circumlunar trajectories for use in returning humans to the\n\nmoon safely. Launching into a free-return trajectory will ensure that the spacecraft\n\nwill return to a landing site on the earth without the use of any propulsive\n\nmaneuvers in case of an accident such as the one experienced by Apollo 13.\n\nAfter the spacecraft is determined to be in good working condition, it can be\n\ntransferred from the free-return trajectory into one favorable for injection into a\n\nlunar orbit.\n\nChapter 8 discusses opportunities for further study in navigation, mission design\n\nand analysis, and related topics. Appendix A gives a brief review of vector analysis,\n\nwhich is especially important for students who are returning to academia after a\n\nlong absence. Appendix B defines projects the students can perform to test and\n\nstrengthen their knowledge of Astrodynamics and the techniques and tools for\n\nspace missions. Appendix C provides additional parameters for use in designing\n\nfree-return circumlunar trajectories.\n\nThere are exercises at the end of each of Chaps. 1\u20137 for use in strengthening and\n\ntesting the students\u2019 grasp of the technical material. To aid the students in this\n\nprocess, numerical answers with units are supplied in the back of the book for\n\nselected exercises.\n\nReferences for the material covered are listed at the end of the book. References\n\nare also listed at the end of Chaps. 1\u20137 and at selected points within these chapters,\n\nwhere they are identified by the names of the authors (or editors). In the case of\n\nauthors who provided multiple sources, the year or year and month of the reference\n\nis (are) given. The students can then check the list in the back of the book to obtain\n\nthe complete bibliographic information for identifying the particular source.\n\nChapter 8 gives complete bibliographic information for the references it cites as\n\nsources of material for further study.

Appendix A) is in the concise\n\nformulation of physical laws and the derivation of other results from these laws.\n\nWe will develop and use the differential equations of motion for a body moving\n\nunder the influence of a gravitational force only. In Chap. 5, we will add other\n\n(perturbing) forces to our model.\n\nThere are related disciplines, which are part of Flight Dynamics.\n\nDef.: Celestial Mechanics is the study of the natural motion of celestial bodies.\n\nDef.: Astrodynamics is the study of the controlled flight paths of spacecraft.\n\nDef.: Orbital Mechanics is the study of the principles governing the motion of\n\nbodies around other bodies under the influence of gravity and other forces.\n\nThese subjects consider translational motion in a gravity field.\n\nAttitude Dynamics and Attitude Control consider the spacecraft\u2019s rotational\n\nmotion about its center of mass.\n\nDef.: Spacecraft attitude dynamics is the applied science whose aim is to\n\nunderstand and predict how the spacecraft\u2019s orientation evolves.\n\nIn spacecraft mission activities, there is a coupling between satellite translation\n\n(the orbital variables) and spacecraft rotation (the attitude variables). In spite of the\n\ncoupling effects, much of orbital mechanics proceeds by largely ignoring the effects\n\nof spacecraft attitude dynamics and vice versa. The field of Flight Dynamics,\n\nhowever, considers 6 degrees of freedom (DOF), consisting of 3 DOF from Orbital\n\nMechanics and 3 DOF from Attitude Dynamics.\n\nAn example of an essentially 6DOF problem is: EDL (entry, descent, and\n\nlanding), e.g., the landing of the Phoenix spacecraft on Mars 5/25/08. More\n\ninformation on the Phoenix mission can be found at the Phoenix Mars Mission\n\nWebsite at http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/.\n\n# Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015\nG.R. Hintz, Orbital Mechanics and Astrodynamics,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_1\n\n1\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_5\nhttp://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/\n\n\nParallel disciplines that must be part of spacecraft mission analyses include:\n\nOrbital Mechanics Attitude Dynamics\n\nOrbit Determination Attitude Determination\n\nFlight Path Control Attitude Control\n\nOf these six disciplines, we consider primarily Orbital Mechanics plus related\n\nissues in Flight Path Control. Hence, our objective is to study the controlled flight\n\npaths of spacecraft, viz., Astrodynamics.\n\n1.2 Mathematical Models\n\nUse of Mathematical Models to Solve Physical Problems\n\nFigure 1.1 describes the procedure for using a mathematical model to solve a\n\nphysical problem.\n\nIn engineering, we make simplifying assumptions in our mathematical model to:\n\n1. Get a good approximation to a solution\n\n2. Gain insight into the problem\n\n3. Get a good starting point for a more accurate numerical solution\n\n4. Reduce computing time and costs.\n\nExample: Archimedes\n\nThe king told Archimedes that he had given the goldsmith gold to make a crown\n\nfor him. However, he suspected that the goldsmith had kept some of the gold and\n\nadded a baser metal in its place. So his task for Archimedes was to determine\n\nwhether or not his new crown was made of pure gold. Archimedes thought about\n\nthis problem until one day when he was in the public bath and he saw water\n\nsplashing out of a bathtub. Then, he yelled \u201cEureka\u201d and ran to his working area\n\nto demonstrate the answer to the problem.\n\nHe placed the crown in a vat filled with water with a basin below the vat to catch\n\nthe overflow. He obtained the amount of gold that equaled the volume of water that\n\noverflowed the vat. Then he placed this amount of gold on one side of a lever and\n\nthe crown on the other side as shown in Fig. 1.2. The end of the lever with the gold\n\ndescended, indicating that the crown was not pure gold. After Archimedes reported\n\nhis findings to the king, the goldsmith did not cheat any more kings.\n\nPhysical\nProblem\n\nMath\nModel\n\nSolve\nthe\nproblem\nin math\nmodel.\n\nApply results\n\nConstruct Math model\n\nFig. 1.1 Using a\nmathematical model to\n\nsolve physical problems\n\n2 1 Fundamentals of Astrodynamics\n\n\n\nDynamics, including Astrodynamics, is a deductive discipline, which enables us:\n\n1. To describe in quantitative terms how mechanical systems move when acted on\n\nby given forces or\n\n2. To determine which forces must be applied to a system to cause it to move in a\n\nspecified manner.\n\nA dynamics problem is solved in two major steps:\n\n1. Formulation of the equation of motion (EOM), the math model, and\n\n2. Extraction of information from the EOM.\n\nOptimization of rocket trajectories is usually accomplished by analytical and\n\nnumerical approaches in a complimentary fashion. Dereck Lawden (cf. reference\n\nfor Lawden) says; \u201c. . . by making suitable simplifying assumptions, the actual\nproblem can be transformed into an idealized problem whose solution is analyti-\n\ncally tractable, then this latter solution will often provide an excellent substitute for\n\nthe optimal motor thrust programme in the actual situation. All that then remains to\n\nbe done is to recompute the trajectory employing this programme and taking\n\naccount of the real circumstances. Further, it is only by adopting the analytical\n\napproach in any field of research, that those general principles, which lead to a real\n\nunderstanding of the nature of the solutions, are discovered. Lacking such an\n\nappreciation, our sense of direction for the numerical attack will be defective and,\n\nas a consequence, computations will become unnecessarily lengthy or even quite\n\nineffective.\u201d\n\nThe analytical solution provides insight into how to approach a problem. It also\n\nenables you to verify that your solution is plausible and correct. You do not want to\n\nput yourself in the position of having your boss tell you that the results you have\n\npresented violate a basic principle and then be forced to say, \u201cBut the computer said\n\n. . . .\u201d Another reason for looking at an idealized problem is that the insight gained\ncan be used for mission planning and design purposes or feasibility studies for\n\nwhich exact values are not available.\n\nAu\n\nFig. 1.2 Archimedes\u2019 Gold\nExperiment\n\n1.2 Mathematical Models 3\n\n\n\nHigh-precision software run in land-based computers or powerful real-time\n\nonboard computing provide precision numerical results and ultimately the\n\ncommands to be executed by the spacecraft\u2019s onboard subsystems.\n\nCoordinate Systems\n\nTo study motion, we need to set up a reference frame because we need to know\n\n\u201cmotion with respect to what?\u201d\n\nInertial frames are \u201cfixed with respect to the fixed stars,\u201d i.e., non-rotating and\n\nnon-accelerating with respect to the fixed (from our perspective) stars, which is an\n\nimaginary situation. Practically speaking, an inertial system is moving with essen-\n\ntially constant velocity.\n\nExample Geocentric equatorial system or Earth-centered Inertial (ECI) coordinate\nsystem\n\nUse: To study orbital motion about the Earth\n\nDefinition:\n\n\u2022 Origin at the center of the earth\n\u2022 X-axis pointing to the first point of Aries, i.e., the vernal equinox. The vernal\n\nequinox direction is a directed line from the earth to the sun at the instant the sun\n\npasses through the earth\u2019s equatorial plane at the beginning of spring.\n\n\u2022 Z-axis\u2014normal to the instantaneous equatorial plane\n\u2022 Y satisfies Y\u00bcZ?X, which completes the right-handed coordinate system\nExample Heliocentric-ecliptic system\n\nUse: for example to study orbital motion in interplanetary (I/P) flight\n\nDefinition:\n\n\u2022 Origin at the center of mass of the sun\n\u2022 The fundamental (XY) plane is the mean plane of the earth\u2019s orbit, called the\n\necliptic plane.\n\n\u2022 The reference (X) direction is again the vernal equinox, where the X axis is the\nintersection of these two fundamental planes and points to the sun when it crosses\n\nthe equator from south to north in its apparent annual motion along the ecliptic.\n\nThe directions of the vernal equinox and the earth\u2019s axis of rotation shift slowly\n\nin ways to be discussed later (Chap. 5). Therefore, we will refer to X, Y, Z\n\ncoordinates for the equator and equinox of a particular year or date, e.g., equator\n\nand equinox of 2000.0 or \u201cof date.\u201d We will consider measures of time in Chap. 4.\n\nFor now, we will not consider this level of precision, ignoring perturbations such as\n\n4 1 Fundamentals of Astrodynamics\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_4\n\n\nthe precession of the earth. We consider an inertial system that is fixed with respect\n\nto the fixed stars as Newton did. For more information on coordinate systems, see\n\nfor example Sect. 2.2 of the reference by Bate, Mueller, and White (BMW).\n\nNon-inertial systems are rotating or accelerating. For example, a system that is\n\nfixed to the earth is rotating and, therefore, non-inertial. Such a coordinate system is\n\nchosen as the one that is natural for a particular type of problem.\n\n1.3 Physical Principles\n\nTycho Brahe (1546\u20131601), a Danish astronomer, took accurate observations of the\n\nposition of Mars before the telescope was invented. Brahe used a quadrant circle to\n\nsight the planets and stars. His large, accurate instruments yielded measurements\n\nthat were accurate to within 4 min of arc. Brahe hired Kepler as an assistant to\n\nanalyze the vast bulk of data that he had collected.\n\nJohannes Kepler (1571\u20131630), an Austrian mathematician and astronomer,\n\nworked briefly with Tycho Brahe and inherited his data books after Brahe\u2019s death\n\nin 1601. Kepler devoted many years to intense study of these data to determine a\n\nmathematical description of the planetary motion described by the data. He derived\n\na set of three empirical laws that describe planetary motion and led to our current\n\nunderstanding of the orbital motion of planets, moons, asteroids, and comets as well\n\nas artificial satellites and spacecraft.\n\nEmpirical laws are known from experience or observation. We derive results\n\nfrom these laws. In particular, we will derive the equations of motion from\n\nNewton\u2019s Laws of Motion and his Universal Law of Gravitation.\n\nKepler\u2019s Laws\n\nKepler\u2019s Laws are:\n\n1. The orbit of each planet is an ellipse with the sun at a focus.\n\n2. The line joining the planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas inside the ellipse in\n\nequal time intervals.\n\nTherefore, the velocity at closest approach is greater than the velocity at the\n\nfurthest distance from the sun. Kepler\u2019s Second Law is illustrated in Fig. 1.3.\n\n3. The square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of its mean\n\ndistance from the sun. That is,\n\nvp\n\nva\n\nvp > va\n\n?t\n?t\n\nFig. 1.3 Kepler\u2019s\nSecond Law\n\n1.3 Physical Principles 5\n\n\n\n?2planet / meandistance from sun\u00f0 \u00de3\n\nwhere the symbol ? denotes the period (duration) of an orbit.\nJohannes Kepler (1571\u20131630), an Austrian mathematician and astronomer, pur-\n\nsued his scientific career with extraordinary enthusiasm and diligence despite several\n\nhardships. His hands were crippled and his eyesight impaired from smallpox as a boy.\n\nHe suffered from religious persecution for his protestant beliefs. He lost his first wife\n\nand several children. Often in desperate financial difficulties, he endured a bare\n\nsubsistence livelihood. He even had to defend his mother from a charge of witchcraft.\n\nKepler, as Imperial Mathematician in Prague, published his third law in\n\nHarmonice Mundi (The Harmony of the World) in 1619, 10 years after the\nappearance of his first two laws in Astronomia Nova De Motibus Stellae Martis,\nknown as Astronomia Nova.\n\nNewton\u2019s Laws\n\nSir Isaac Newton1 (1642\u20131727) defined the forces at work in Philosophiae\nNaturalis Principia Mathematica (The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philos-\nophy), usually called the Principia, 1687. Kepler\u2019s Laws must follow. Newton\ndetermined why the planets move in this manner. Newton\u2019s Laws apply only to\n\nparticles moving in an inertial reference frame.\n\nNewton\u2019s Laws of Motion are:\n\n1. Principle of Inertia: Every body is at rest or in uniform motion along a straight\n\nline unless it is acted on by a force.\n\n2. Principle of Momentum: The rate of change of linear momentum is equal to the\n\nforce impressed and is in the same direction as that force. That is,\n\n1 Isaac Newton (1642\u20131727) is generally regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all\n\ntime. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1661 and graduated with a BA degree in 1665. In\n\n1668, he received a master\u2019s degree and was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, one of\n\nthe most prestigious positions in English academia at the time. In his latter years, Newton served in\n\nParliament and was warden of the mint. In 1703, he was elected president of the Royal Society of\n\nLondon, of which he had been a member since 1672.

In this flight, the spacecraft experiences gravita-\n\ntional attraction from all the bodies of the universe plus non-gravitational forces\n\n(to be discussed in Chap. 5). This is a complicated problem.

Other forces and all torques are assumed to be zero.\n\nConsider an X, Y, Z inertial system. Figure 2.1 shows the positions r1 and r2 of\n\nthe two masses, m1 and m2, respectively, the position rc of the center of mass (cm),\n\nand the position r\u00bc r1? r2 of m1 with respect to (wrt) m2.\nDef.: The center of mass for the 2-body system in the X, Y, and Z frame is\n\nrc \u00bc m1r1 \u00fe m2r2\nm1 \u00fem2 \u00f02:1\u00de\n\nwhere m1 +m2\u00bc the total mass of the system.\nAssume:\n\n1. The bodies of mass m1 and m2 are point masses or are spherically symmetric.\n\n2. The particles m1 and m2 never touch.\n\n3. No forces are acting on m1 and m2 other than the gravitational ones between m1\nand m2. These forces act along the line joining the two centers of mass.\n\nAssumptions (1) and (2) imply that we can treat m1 and m2 as particles located at\n\ntheir centers of mass. We refer to the motion of the two masses as \u201c2-body\n\nmechanics\u201d or \u201cKeplerian motion.\u201d\n\nBy rearranging Eq. (2.1), we obtain\n\nr1 ? rc \u00bc m2r\nm1 \u00fem2 \u00f02:2\u00de\n\nwhich gives the distance from m1 to the center of mass of the 2-body system.

The vector equation is equivalent to three scalar equations:\n\n\u20acx\u00fe ?x\nr3\n\n\u00bc 0\n\n\u20acy\u00fe ? y\nr3\n\n\u00bc 0\n\n\u20acz\u00fe ? z\nr3\n\n\u00bc 0\n\n5. By writing the equation as\n\n\u20acr \u00bc ? ?\nr2\nr?\n\nwe see that\n\n\u20acr / 1\nr2\n\nFrom this relationship, we see that acceleration decreases with the area of the\n\nsurface of a sphere, S\u00bc 4?r2.\n6. The equation is a nonlinear (non-constant coefficient because of the 1/r2),\n\nsecond-order vector differential equation.\n\n26 2 Keplerian Motion\n\n\n\n7.

The equation is unchanged if r is replaced by ?r, so the equation gives the\nmotion of m2 with respect to m1 and m1 with respect to m2.\n\nEven though the second-order vector differential equation governing the relative\n\nmotion of two bodies is nonlinear, we will find that the equation does have a\n\ncompletely general analytical solution. The solution of the differential equation is\n\nexpedited by some ad hoc vector operations applied to the equation of motion.\n\nThese vector manipulations produce transformed versions of the equation of motion\n\nthat are perfect differentials and, hence, immediately integrable.\n\nSolution of the Equation of Motion\n\n1.

Consider a star that has a massive planet\u2014say Jupiter-sized.\n\nIts motion about the center of mass (barycenter) of the system can be observed,\n\n2.2 Two-Body Problem 29\n\n\n\nindicating the existence of the planet, by measuring Doppler shifts in the star\u2019s light\n\ncaused by motion toward and away from us. This technique is sometimes called the\n\n\u201cradial velocity method\u201d or the \u201cwobble method.\u201d\n\nMethods of Detecting Extrasolar Planets:\n\n1. Astrometry involves measuring the precise motions of a star on the sky as an\n\nunseen planet tugs the star back and forth.\n\n2. Radial velocity detects the wobble of a star by measuring Doppler shifts in the\n\nstar\u2019s light caused by motion toward and away from us.\n\n3. The transit method looks for dips in a star\u2019s brightness as orbiting planets pass by\n\nand block the light from the star.\n\n2.3 Central Force Motion\n\nAnother Simplifying Assumption\n\nFor the problem of a spacecraft moving about a planet or a planet moving about the\n\nsun, one mass is much greater than the other. Hence, we assume\n\n4. m2>>m1.\n\nThen the motion of m1 is essentially the motion of a particle in an inertially fixed\n\nfield centered at m2 because rc\u00bc r2. Strictly speaking, this model is the \u201crelative\n2-body problem,\u201d because we solve for the motion of the satellite relative to the\n\ncentral body. However, as we will learn later, this is the only n-body problem, for\n\nany n, that can be solved analytically in closed form. So there is no confusion\n\nintroduced by referring to it as the \u201c2-body problem,\u201d as is often done (Fig. 2.2).\n\nRecall that the cm of a 2-body system never accelerates. For example, the earth\n\nhas eccentricity e> 0 but small, which implies that the cm does accelerate slightly.\nHowever, a system centered at the cm of the earth is \u201cinertial enough,\u201d i.e., it is\n\nclose enough to being inertial.\n\nm1\n\nY\n\nX\n\nZ m2\n\nrcr2\n\nr1\n\nFig. 2.2 Moving the center\nof motion for the two-body\n\nsystem\n\n30 2 Keplerian Motion\n\n\n\nDef.: A force whose line of action always passes through a fixed point O in inertial\n\nspace and whose magnitude is a function only of the distance r from the fixed point\n\nO is called a central force.\n\nDef.: A central force is attractive or repulsive according to as it is directed toward or\n\naway from the fixed point O.\n\nDef.: An inverse square force is a central force whose magnitude is inversely\n\nproportional to the distance squared (r2) from O.\n\nWe are interested in the gravitational force F in Newton\u2019s Law of Universal\n\nGravitation:\n\nF \u00bc ?Gm1m2\nr2\n\nr\n\nr\n\nwhich is an attractive central force.\n\nSince m2>>m1,\n\n? \u00bc G m1 \u00fe m2\u00f0 \u00de ffi Gm2\ni.e., m1 is negligible.\n\nModeling Assumptions:\n\n1. r\n\u2022\n\n2 \u00bc r\u2022 c \u00bc 0\n2. r2\u00bc rc as in Fig. 2.3\n3. m1 +m2\u00bcm2\n\nIf m2>>m1, KE \u00bc 12m1 r\n\u2022\n\n\u2022 r\n\u2022? \t\n\nfrom Exercise 2.2.\n\nCentral force motion results in a conic section orbit of the form\n\nr \u00bc h\n2=?\n\n1\u00fe e cos ?\n\nm1 at r1\n\nY\n\nX\n\nZ m2 at r2 = rc\n\nr\nr2\n\nr1\n\nFig. 2.3 Two-body system\nwith center of motion at m2\n\n2.3 Central Force Motion 31\n\n\n\nwith the focus at the center of motion, m2, and ?\u00bcGm2. Thus, we have proved\nKepler\u2019s first law (KI) from Newton\u2019s Laws. In the process, we have extended KI to\n\ninclude circles, parabolas and hyperbolas in addition to ellipses (as in KI).\n\nWe drop the subscript on m2 so that ?\u00bcGm. where m\u00bcmass of the central\nbody.

I thought this comment was unusual, until I realized that he\n\nmeans that water would flow uphill in the model. The term ?/r decreases as r increases,\nwhich implies that moving to lower PE would occur as r increases, i.e., as water flows\n\nuphill. We have??/r, which decreases as r increases. The author is teasing us.\nIn the future, when we say \u201cKE\u201d or \u201cPE,\u201d we will be referring to the normalized\n\nKE and normalized PE, respectively.\n\n32 2 Keplerian Motion\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_1\n\n\nRemarks:\n\n1. In potential theory, we consider a force field, i.e., a region in space in which a\n\nforce F is defined at every point. For our application, the field is gravitational\n\nwith F(x, y, z) being the force acting on a unit mass at each point (x, y, z).\n\nThe force F experienced by a unit test body of the appropriate nature is called the\n\nfield intensity.\n\n2. The amount of work that must be done when a unit test body is moved along an\n\narbitrary curve in the force field defined by the vector function F is the line\n\nintegral of the tangential component of F, i.e.,\n\nW \u00bc\n\u00f0r2\nr1\n\nF \u2022 dr\n\nas defined in Chap. 1. If there is no dissipation of energy through friction or\n\nsimilar effects, then the force F is conservative and is the gradient of the scalar\n\nfunction\n\nU x, y, z\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\n\u00f0r2\nr1\n\nF \u2022 dr\n\nThe function U is called the \u201cpotential function of the field.\u201d We call U the\n\n\u201cgravitational potential.\u201d\n\n3. A gravitational field is conservative. That is, an object moving under the\n\ninfluence of gravity alone does not lose or gain mechanical energy but only\n\nexchanges one form of energy, kinetic, for another, potential energy.\n\n4. We choose the zero reference for PE at infinity. The price we pay for this\n\nsimplification is that the PE of a satellite is always negative.\n\nVelocity Vector\n\nThis subsection describes properties of the velocity vector for use in the continuing\n\ndevelopment.\n\nThe velocity vector\n\nv ? dr\ndt\n\n? lim\n?t!0\n\nr t\u00fe ?t\u00f0 \u00de ? r t\u00f0 \u00de\n?t\n\n\u00bc lim\n?t!0\n\n?r\n?s\n\n?s\n?t\n\n\u00bc ds\ndt\n\nr?

The type of conic depends on the angle between the cutting plane and the\n\nbase of the cone. If the plane section is parallel to the base, the conic is a circle. If the\n\nplane is inclined to the base at an angle less than that between the lines that generate\n\nthe cone and its base, the section is an ellipse. If the cutting plane is parallel to one of\n\nthe generators, the section is a parabola. Finally, if the plane is inclined to the base at\n\na still greater angle, the plane will also cut the cone formed by the extension of the\n\ngenerators. The section consisting of these two parts is a hyperbola.\n\nHyperbola\n\nHyperbola\n\nParabola\n\nEllipse\n\nCircle\n\nFig. 2.6 Conic sections\n\n36 2 Keplerian Motion\n\n\n\nAlthough conic sections were known to the ancient Greeks, the simplest proof,\n\nwhich relates the geometrical property to the focal definition of the ellipse, was\n\nsupplied in 1822 by the Belgian mathematician Germinal P. Dandelin (1794\u20131847).\n\nReference: Richard H. Battin, 1999.\n\nWe consider each conic section in turn.\n\n1. Ellipse (a> 0)\n\nDef.: An ellipse is the locus of all points, the sum of whose distances from two\n\nfixed points (the foci) is constant.\n\nThat is, as indicated in Fig. 2.7, an ellipse is the set of all points P such that\n\nPF \u00fe PF? \u00bc 2a\nwhere F and F* are the foci.

Parabola\n\nDef.: A parabola is the locus of all points whose distance from a fixed point (the\n\nfocus) is equal to the distance from a fixed straight line (the directrix).\n\nThat is, as indicated in Fig. 2.9, a parabola is the set of all points P that satisfy\n\nthe following equation:\n\nPF \u00bc PN\nwhere N denotes the directrix N.\n\nP\n\nF\n?a\n\n?ae\n\n?b\nr\n\nP?\n\nF?\n\nReal\nbranch of\ntrajectory\n\nImaginary\nbranch of\ntrajectory\n\nFig. 2.8 A Hyperbola\n\n38 2 Keplerian Motion\n\n\n\nFormulas:\n\ne \u00bc 1\np \u00bc 2rp\n\nwhere rp denotes the radius at periapsis The value of p can be determined from\n\nthe Conic Equation by evaluating r at 0\t true anomaly to obtain rp\u00bc p/2.\n\nOrbit Classification: Conic Section Orbits\n\nFigure 2.10 displays the categories of conic section orbits for e> 0. The point of\nclosest approach on any conic section orbit has several names: periapsis, periapse,\n\nperifocus, plus names that are used for specific central bodies. For example, the\n\nperiapsis of an orbit about the sun is called \u201cperihelion\u201d, about the earth \u201cperigee,\u201d\n\nabout Jupiter \u201cperijove,\u201d about Saturn \u201cperichrone,\u201d and about the moon of the\n\nearth \u201cperilune.\u201d\n\nThe energy E for each type of conic section orbit can be deduced from\nEq.

In one of these meetings, I told a\n\nstory to describe the motion of a spacecraft at launch. Since I wanted to pick\n\nsomeone in the class who had a good arm, I asked if the pitcher from the baseball\n\nteam was in the room. The answer was \u201cNo.\u201d So I asked if the catcher was in the\n\nclassroom, knowing that she was there because she was my daughter, Tana. Tana\n\nraised her hand. (I was very proud. By the way, I could have picked her twin sister,\n\nKristin, who was the shortstop and backup catcher. But I continued the story with\n\nTana.) Then I asked, \u201cWhat is the tallest building in the world and we agreed that it\n\nwas the Sears Building in Chicago. Then I said that Tana took her baseball to the top\n\nof the Sears Building and throw the ball off the building. The ball fell to the ground.\n\nShe was not happy with that flight so she retrieved her baseball and threw it harder a\n\nsecond time. The ball traveled further from the building but fell to the ground. It\n\ntook the same length of time to hit the ground because the force of gravity was the\n\nsame. Again she was not happy. So she retrieved her baseball and wound up and\n\nthrew it even harder. This time the ball fell at the rate of the curvature of the earth,\n\nmoving in a circle about the earth. Each time Tana threw the ball I drew the path in\n\nFig. 2.11 on the board in the classroom. Tana put on her glove and walked to the\n\nother side of the building and caught the ball. She threw the ball again still harder so\n\nthat the ball traveled higher than the last time. But eventually the force of gravity\n\npulled the ball down as it moved around the earth. It moved in an ellipse until it\n\narrived back where Tana caught it. Then she threw it harder so that the ball escaped\n\nthe pull of gravity, moving along a curved path called a \u201cparabola.\u201d Throwing the\n\nball still harder sent it on another path called a \u201chyperbola,\u201d which I drew on the\n\nboard, as shown in Fig. 2.11. At this point, I said, \u201cYou know that a baseball cannot\n\nbe launched this way.\u201d I said that we really use a spacecraft to launch our payload as\n\nshown in the bottom of Fig. 2.11, which I drew on the board. I said the spacecraft\n\ntravels at about 8,000 miles per hour so that it will fall at the rate of the curvature of\n\nthe earth.\n\nOne question that remains is: \u201cWhat keeps the spacecraft in orbit from falling?\u201d\n\nThe answer is: \u201cNothing.\u201d If the spacecraft were not falling, then, by Newton\u2019s First\n\nLaw of Motion, it would continue flying in a straight line as shown in the upper\n\nright of Fig. 2.12. But it is falling at the rate of curvature of the earth, so it travels in\n\na circular path around the earth.\n\n40 2 Keplerian Motion\n\n\n\nTypes of Orbits\n\nWe consider various types of orbits that satellites or spacecraft might travel in\n\naround a central body.\n\nDef.: A satellite is any object in orbital motion.\n\nNatural satellites are those objects that were not sent into space by humans.\n\nAn artificial satellite or spacecraft is a machine sent into space by humans.\n\nTime is a fundamental parameter in the analysis of orbits. As humans improved\n\ntheir ability to measure time, they noticed that the time of day as measured by a\n\nEarth\n\nhyperbolic\norbit\n\nParabolic\norbit\n\n8,000 mi/hr\n\u201cabove\u201d\n\natmosphere\n\nSe\nar\ns\n\ne = 0\n\n0 < e < 1\n\nFig. 2.11 Tana throws her baseball\n\nNI if not falling\n\nif is falling\n\nFig. 2.12 What keeps the\nspacecraft in orbit from\n\nfalling?\n\n2.3 Central Force Motion 41\n\n\n\nsundial could vary from the norm (average) by as much as 15 min. in February and\n\nNovember as shown in Fig. 2.13, which shows the minutes slow or fast compared to\n\nthe average solar day.\n\nReference: Jesperson and Fitz-Randolph, reprinted with permission of Dover\n\nPublications, Inc.\n\nDef.: A solar day is the time interval between two successive \u201chigh noons\u201d or upper\n\ntransits of the sun.\n\nDef.: A mean solar day is the average length of the individual solar days throughout\n\nthe year.\n\nWe break up a mean solar day into 24 h.\n\nDef.: A sidereal day is the time interval between two successive high transits of a\n\nstar. That is, a sidereal day is the time required for the earth to rotate once on its axis\n\nrelative to the stars.\n\nIf, in Fig. 2.14, you follow the point A fixed to the surface of the earth, you will\n\nsee that it is initially subsolar and points to stars beyond the sun, then, as the earth\n\nturns about its axis and revolves about the sun, A is again lined up with the same\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\nJAN\n\nMINUTES FAST\n\nMINUTES SLOW\n\nJULY DEC\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFig. 2.13 Variations in the\nlength of a day\n\nA\n\nA\nSun\n\n1 Solar\nday\n\nA\n\n1 Siderea\nl\n\nday\n\nFig. 2.14 Solar and sidereal day\n\n42 2 Keplerian Motion\n\n\n\nstars, but not with the sun, and eventually points to the sun again. The point A lines\n\nup with the stars after one sidereal day and with the sun after one solar day.\n\nA sidereal day is shorter than a mean solar day because, during one revolution\n\nof the earth about its axis, the earth moves some distance in its orbit about the sun.\n\nOne sidereal day is 23 h:56 min: 4 s of mean solar time.\n\nReasons for variations in the length of a day:\n\n1. The earth\u2019s orbit is an ellipse.\n\n2. The earth\u2019s axis is tilted at ~23.5\t with respect to the ecliptic plane.\n\nFor a sidereal day, these factors are not important at stellar distances.\n\nFigure 2.15 displays several examples of orbits. The actual orbits are not in the\n\nsame plane, but are shown as coplanar for comparison purposes. We consider the\n\nfollowing types of orbits:\n\nFig. 2.15 Orbital altitudes for spacecraft [Published with the permission of Lloyd Wood.\naccessed 1/10/2014]\n\n2.3 Central Force Motion 43\n\n\n\n1. Low Earth Orbit (LEO)\n\nA LEO orbit is above the thickest part of the atmosphere and below one of\n\ndifferent altitudes above the surface of the earth, depending on who is\n\ndiscussing the matter. So LEO satisfies\n\n~100 mi (161 km)< altitude< ~1500 km, ~2000 km, or ~3000 km\nNote that altitude\u00bc r?R\n, where R\n\u00bc the mean equatorial radius of the\n\nearth\n\nSuch orbits have ? ~ 90 min. with 16\u201317 orbits/day and usually are almost\ncircular with e< 0.03.\n\nExamples: ISS and a parking orbit about the earth\n\nExample: Aura: A Mission to Understand and Protect the Air We Breathe\n\nAltitude \u00bc 705 km Launch Date : July 10, 2004\nReference: http://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n\n2. Polar Orbit\n\nA polar orbit travels over (or possibly nearly over) the North and South\n\nPoles.\n\nObjective: Global coverage\n\n3. Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO)\n\nDef.: A geosynchronous orbit (GEO) is an earth orbit that has a period equal to\n\none sidereal day.\n\nDef.: A geostationary orbit (GEO) is a circular, geosynchronous orbit in the\n\nearth\u2019s equatorial plane.\n\nA spacecraft that is in a geostationary orbit will hover over a fixed point on\n\nthe earth\u2019s equator.\n\n4.

Now they are used for high latitude communication.\n\n44 2 Keplerian Motion\n\nhttp://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n\n\n7.

Sun Synchronous Orbit (SSO)\n\nCharacteristics: The orbit rotates so as to maintain approximately constant\n\norientation (to be defined later) with respect to the sun.\n\n10. Repeating Ground Track\n\nCharacteristic: Subsatellite ground track repeats.\n\nExample: Aquarius/SAC-D where the Aquarius experiment was supplied by\n\nNASA and SAC-D experiments by CONAE (Space Agency of Argentina).\n\nOrbit characteristics: Frozen orbit, SSO, repeating ground track, nearly\n\npolar, and LEO at 705-km altitude above the earth\n\nExamples: The A-Train is a precession of 4 (was 5) earth-orbiting satellites,\n\nAqua, CloudSat, CALIPSO, and Aura.

Thus, we define:\n\nDef.: An orbital maneuver is the transfer of a spacecraft from one orbit into another\n\norbit via a change in the velocity vector.\n\nSuch orbital maneuvers fall into two general categories:\n\n1. Statistical\u2014usually small maneuvers that correct for orbit determination and\n\nmaneuver execution errors and small forces experienced in flight.\n\n2. Deterministic\u2014usually large maneuvers to adjust or transfer into another orbit,\n\ne.g., an orbit insertion into an orbit about a planet.\n\nDeterministic maneuvers are implemented with a statistical part that corrects the\n\nerrors accumulated by the time the maneuver is designed.\n\nThe first category consists of by far the greatest number of maneuvers so we\n\nconsider them first.\n\n3.2 Statistical Maneuvers\n\nTrajectory Correction Maneuvers\n\nStatistical maneuvers are usually called \u201ctrajectory correction maneuvers\u201d, but also\n\nhave other names.\n\nDef.: A trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) is an orbital maneuver performed by\n\na spacecraft to correct the spacecraft\u2019s flight path. A TCMmay also be called a trim\n\nmaneuver, a trim, an orbit trim maneuver (OTM), an orbit correction maneuver\n\n# Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015\nG.R. Hintz, Orbital Mechanics and Astrodynamics,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_3\n\n59\n\n\n\n(OCM), or a midcourse maneuver. (The term \u201cmidcourse maneuver\u201d is usually\n\napplied to interplanetary corrections.)\n\nStatistical maneuvers are performed to remove the effects of orbit determination\n\nand execution errors experienced at previous TCMs or the launch and other small\n\nerrors (cf. Chap. 5). Methods for estimating the trajectory and computing the\n\nassociated covariance matrix, which describes dispersions statistically, are treated\n\nin the reference by Tapley, Schutz, and Born (TSB). Maneuver execution errors are\n\ndescribed in terms of the Gates Model (defined in the reference by Gates), which\n\naccounts for four independent error sources: fixed- and proportional-magnitude- and\n\nfixed- and proportional-pointing errors. The word \u201cfixed\u201d does not mean that the\n\nerrors are constant, but rather refers to the independence of the two fixed errors with\n\nrespect to the magnitude of the?v vector being implemented. \u201cProportional\u201d means\nthat the dispersions of these two are proportional to the magnitude of the?v. Each of\nthe four sources is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution with a zero mean. The\n\nreference by Goodson documents the evolution of the execution error model\n\nparameters for the TCMs performed by the Cassini\u2013Huygens spacecraft, along\n\nwith the analyses, procedures, and software associated with the model development.\n\nThe opportunity to perform maneuvers to correct for statistical errors is planned\n\nin the mission schedule and the onboard sequence of events. As the time of the\n\nstatistical TCM draws near, the Navigation Team estimates the trajectory and\n\ncompares it to the desired trajectory to see if a TCM is required. The nominal or\n\nexpected value of the ?v for such a maneuver is small or even zero and some of\nthese statistical maneuvers are not performed because the expected miss distance is\n\nwithin the uncertainties or allowable tolerances.\n\nFor example, one or two statistical TCMs are often performed after launch to\n\nremove the launch errors. The 1? value for the first TCM, if performed at 10 days\nafter launch, is referred to as the launch vehicle\u2019s \u201cfigure of merit\u201d (FOM) and is\n\nused as a measure of the vehicle\u2019s performance.\n\nSelecting a spacecraft maneuver strategy usually involves tradeoffs of many\n\ncompeting factors. The reference by Hintz and Chadwick describes such a tradeoff\n\nprocess. The method uses parametric data to cope with targeting requirements,\n\nthruster configuration and performance, hardware constraints, operational\n\nconsiderations, propellant optimization demands, and expected maneuver execution\n\nand orbit determination errors, while remaining flexible to react to new conditions.\n\nManeuver Implementation\n\nTo make trim maneuvers, the spacecraft must carry propellant and oxidizer or a\n\nmonopropellant onboard. There have been spacecraft that did not have a propulsion\n\nsystem.\n\nExample 1: The Galileo probe after release from the orbiter vehicle 150 days before\narrival at Jupiter did not have the ability to adjust its trajectory, so it was necessary\n\nto deliver the probe within specified targeting conditions at probe release.\n\n60 3 Orbital Maneuvers\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_5\n\n\nReference: Hintz and Longuski\n\nExample 2: The Swift spacecraft was launched on November 20, 2004 without a\npropulsion system. It did not need to refine its trajectory to look for Gamma Ray\n\nBursts (GRB).\n\nPerforming a TCM usually involves:\n\n1. Turning the spacecraft to point the thrusters in the correct direction to make the\n\nvelocity change ?v. The thrusters must point in the direction opposite the ?v\nvector so that the thrust will be applied in the correct direction by means of NIII.\n\nThe thrust is usually performed in a fixed direction in inertial space. An exception\n\nwas implemented by the Cassini spacecraft at Saturn Orbit Insertion (SOI) on\n\nJuly 1, 2004, when the spacecraft turned at a constant rate during the burn.\n\n2. Igniting the engine at the correct time, equivalently location in orbit.\n\n3. Imparting the ?v. An accelerometer is often used onboard to determine autono-\nmously when the correct ?v has been imparted. A timer is used as a backup to\nend the burn at a specified later time in case the accelerometer fails to terminate\n\nthe burn.\n\n4. Turning back usually to earth pointing for communications. This turn back may\n\nalso be called a \u201drewind\u201d or an \u201cunwind.\u201d\n\nNo turns maneuvers are sometimes used to avoid pointing away from the earth\n\nfor safety purposes. These maneuvers are implemented by burning more than one\n\nthruster. Neither thruster may point in the direction of the desired ?v vector, but the\nsum of the two ?v vectors will as shown in Fig. 3.1.\n\nBurn Models\n\nThese models are:\n\n1. Finite burn\u2014high precision trajectory integration of the equation of motion,\n\nincluding the acceleration due to the maneuver. The EOM is:\n\nr\n? ? \u00bc ? ?\n\nr3\nr\u00fe ap\n\nwhere the first term on the right-hand side of the equation is the acceleration\n\nfrom two-body motion and the second term is the sum of perturbations\n\n?vpart 2\n\n?vpart 1\n\n?vdesir\ned\n\nFig. 3.1 No turns ?vs\n\n3.2 Statistical Maneuvers 61\n\n\n\n(see Chap. 5) to two-body motion. This model is required for precision\n\ncalculations such as those to determine the maneuver parameters that will be\n\nsent to the spacecraft and executed to obtain a trajectory correction.\n\n2.

See Fig. 3.2.\n\nThis impulsive model is acceptable for analysis purposes if the distance traveled\n\nduring the thrusting is negligible when compared to the magnitude of the radius\n\nvector. It is not used to determine maneuver parameters that are to be sent to the\n\nspacecraft.\n\nWe will use the impulsive burn model in our analyses.\n\nNote that vf is determined by a vector addition.

An orbit determination analysis uses tracking data from ground stations\n\nand telemetry data from sensors onboard the spacecraft to provide the position\n\nvector\u00bc (x, y, z), velocity vector\u00bc x? , y? , z?\u00f0 \u00de, and other \u201csolved for\u201d parameters.\n\nr0\n\nrf = r0\n\nvfv0\n\n?vFig. 3.2 Impulsive burn\nmodel\n\n62 3 Orbital Maneuvers\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_5\n\n\nFrom the position and velocity vectors, we compute r0, v0, and ?0 at t\u00bc t0, using\nEqs. (A.1), (2.23), and (2.24). The time t0 is chosen when the spacecraft is acted on\n\nby gravity alone, i.e., essentially no drag, thrusting, or other forces.\n\nAnalytical Computations\n\nIn the following computations, we start with r0, v0, and ?0 and then compute other\nparameters that can be compared to desired values. If necessary, we perform a\n\nmaneuver (fire thrusters) to adjust the orbit.\n\n1.

By examin-\ning Fig. 3.4, we obtain two points: ?0\u00bc 30? and ?0\u00bc 120? where the spacecraft is\nleaving periapsis and ?0\u00bc?30? and ?0\u00bc 240? where the spacecraft is approaching\nperiapsis. The two points are symmetric about the periapsis.\n\nBy multiplying the Energy Equation in the form\n\nE \u00bc v\n2\n0\n\n2\n? ?\nr0\n\nby 2r0/? and solving for X0, we obtain the equation\n\nX0 \u00bc 2r0?

Note that this inequality shows that the range of\nvalues for X0 is as shown in Fig. 3.4.\n\nTo study the figure, we consider the following cases.\n\nCase 1: X0\u00bc 2\nThis value for X0 is along the right-hand edge of the figure and, as discussed above,\n\nrepresents parabolic (escape) trajectories. Setting the Energy Equation equal to zero\n\nand solving for v0, we obtain\n\nv0 \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffi\n2?\nr0\n\nr\n\u00bc vesc\n\nwhere vesc denotes escape velocity.\n\nCase 2: X0 \u00bc r0v02? \u00bc 1\nSolving for v0 obtains\n\nv0 \u00bc\nffiffiffiffi\n?\n\nr0\n\nr\n\u00bc vc\n\nwhere vc denotes circular orbit speed. But the orbit is circular only if ?0\u00bc 0.\nTherefore, the condition v0\u00bc vc is necessary but not sufficient for the orbit to be\ncircular.\n\n66 3 Orbital Maneuvers\n\n\n\nCase 3: ?0\u00bc 0, which implies one of three situations: elliptical orbit at periapsis,\nelliptical orbit at apoapsis, or circular orbit\n\nIf ?0\u00bc 0,\n\ne2 \u00bc X0 ? 1\u00f0 \u00de2\ne \u00bc X0 ? 1j j from Eq: 3:3 and\ntan ?0 \u00bc X0 sin ?0 cos ?0\n\nX0 cos 2?0 ? 1\n\u00bc 0\n\nX0 ? 1\nThis situation has four subcases:\n\n1. For 0?X0< 1, tan?0\u00bc 0, which implies that ?0\u00bc 0 or 180? because the tangent\nfunction has period of 180?, but Fig. 3.4 shows that ?0 must then be 180?.\n\n2. For X0\u00bc 1, e\u00bc 0 because |X0? 1|, which implies that ?0 is indeterminate and the\norbit is circular.\n\n3. For 1<X0< 2, tan?0\u00bc 0, which implies that ?0\u00bc 0 or 180?, but Fig. 3.4\nshows that ?0\u00bc 0?.\n\n4. For X0\u00bc 2, e\u00bc 1 so the orbit is parabolic and tan?0\u00bc 0 implies ?0\u00bc 0.\n\nExample (To study ?):\nSuppose the spacecraft is in an orbit with e\u00bc 0.8.\nThe first column of Table 3.1 gives the true anomaly in deg; the second the flight\n\npath angle in deg as read from Fig. 3.4; and the third the flight path angle in deg as\n\ndetermined from the identity in Eq.

The remainder of the function is symmetric about the value at\n\napoapsis.\n\nFigure 3.5b gives plots of the flight path angle as a function of true anomaly for\n\neccentricity e\u00bc 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 made using the identity in Eq.

Increasing a increases ? from Eq. (2.34).\n\n3.4 Orbit Transfer and Adjustment\n\nWe first treat deterministic maneuvers for which the direction of the angular\n\nmomentum vector, h, is fixed. That is, we consider maneuvers that do not change\n\nthe orbit plane.\n\n70 3 Orbital Maneuvers\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_2#Equ34\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_2#Equ34\n\n\nSingle Maneuver Adjustments\n\nFrom the Energy Equation and Eq. (2.19), we see that energy and e are functions of\n\nthe velocity magnitude. Therefore, maneuvers made in the orbit plane can change\n\nthe energy and eccentricity of the orbit.\n\nWe call an orbital maneuver that does not change the plane of the spacecraft\u2019s\n\norbit an \u201cin-plane maneuver.\u201d As shown in Fig. 3.2, an in-plane maneuver can\n\nchange the magnitude of the velocity vector, so it can change the magnitude of the\n\nangular momentum vector h\u00bc r? v. However, it cannot change the direction of h,\nwhich is orthogonal to the orbit plane. Recall that we are discussing impulsive\n\nmaneuvers, not finite burns.\n\nOne restriction for a single-maneuver adjustment: The new (post-maneuver)\n\norbit must intercept the old (pre-maneuver) orbit at the maneuver point.\n\nMathematical Fact: Two confocal ellipses intersect in 0, 1, or 2 points.\n\nFigure 3.6 shows the three different intersection situations for two confocal\n\nellipses. A spacecraft could transition from one of the ellipses in Fig. 3.6a to the\n\nother by performing a maneuver at the intersection point. A spacecraft could move\n\nfrom one ellipse in Fig. 3.6b to the other by performing a maneuver at either of\n\nthe two intersection points. However, a spacecraft cannot move from one orbit to\n\nthe other as shown in Fig. 3.6c by performing only a single maneuver. One could\n\ndraw two ellipses that intersect in four points, but the ellipses would not be\n\nconfocal.\n\nWe often target a value for the period ?\u00bc ?f, which corresponds to a value a\u00bc af.\nFor example, PVO was positioned in an orbit with ?f\u00bc 24 h to synchronize with\ntracking stations on the earth. Viking maintained ?f\u00bc 24.6 h\u00bc 1 Mars day, which is\ncalled a \u201csol.\u201d\n\nOnce a maneuver location has been selected (by a method such as one that uses\n\nthe tool described in Sect. 7.3), the magnitude r0 of the position vector at the\n\nmaneuver point can be calculated from the Conic Equation as\n\nr0 \u00bc p0\n1 \u00fe e0 cos ?0\n\nwhere e0 and p0 are values for the initial (pre-maneuver) orbit. Note that in previous\n\nanalyses we have only had one value for each of these parameters, but now we have\n\ndifferent values for the initial and final orbit. If a target value ?f is specified, then af\n\na b c\n\nFig. 3.6 Coplanar orbits. (a) One intersection. (b) Two intersections.

Recall the impulsive burn model,\n\nwhich assumes that rf\u00bc r0, so rf is known and vf can be computed.\n\nHohmann Transfer\n\nWalter Hohmann (1880\u20131945), a German engineer, first published his result for a\n\nHohmann transfer as a conjecture in a monograph entitled Die Erreichbarkeit der\nHimmelsko?rper [The Attainability of Celestial Bodies] in 1925. NASA published\nan English translation in NASA Technical Translations F-44, 1960. A rigorous,\n\nanalytic proof of the optimality of such a transfer for a 2-impulse sequence was not\n\navailable until 1963.\n\nProblem: To transfer a spacecraft between two coplanar, circular orbits about the\n\nsame central body by using the minimum ?vTotal\u00bc?v1 +?v2 for a 2-maneuver\nsequence.\n\nNotation: The ?v1 denotes the magnitude of the velocity increment for the first\nmaneuver of the 2-maneuver sequence and ?v2 denotes the magnitude of the\nsecond velocity increment.\n\nOutward Hohmann Transfer Profile\nConsider two coplanar, circular orbits about a central body. Denote the inner\n\ncircle as C1 and its radius as rp. Denote the outer circle as C2 with radius ra.\n\nThe transfer orbit has rp as the radius at periapsis and ra as the radius at apoapsis.\n\nWhen moving in the inner circle, the spacecraft has circular orbit speed, vc1. The\n\nfirst maneuver applies ?v1 along the velocity vector to move the spacecraft into\nthe transfer orbit by giving the spacecraft the velocity vp at periapsis on an ellipse.\n\nThe second maneuver is performed at the apoapsis of the transfer orbit by adding\n\n?v2 to the velocity va at apoapsis to obtain vc2, the speed of the outer circle\n(Fig. 3.7).\n\nNote: The vc1 and ?v1 are collinear and vc2 and ?v2 are collinear. Also the\nsemimajor axis of the transfer ellipse is\n\na \u00bc rp \u00fe ra\n2\n\nExample: Recall from Fig. 2.16 that, if C2 is a GEO, then the transfer orbit is called\na GTO, a geosynchronous transfer orbit.\n\n72 3 Orbital Maneuvers\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_2#Equ34\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_2#Fig16\n\n\nCalculation of ?v1:\n\n?v1 \u00bc vp ? vc1 \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2?\n\nrp\n? 2?\nrp \u00fe ra\n\ns\n?\n\nffiffiffiffi\n?\n\nrp\n\nr\n\n\u00bc\nffiffiffiffi?\nrp\n\nr ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi2 ra\nrp\n\n1\u00fe ra\nrp\n\nvuuuut ? 1\n2\n664\n\n3\n775 \u00f03:16\u00de\n\nCalculation of ?v2:\n\nh \u00bc r? v \u00bc constant vector\n\nAt periapsis, h \u00bc rpvpsin ?\n2\n\n\u00bc rpvp\nAt apoapsis, h \u00bc rava sin ?\n\n2\n\u00bc rava\n\nTherefore, conservation of angular momentum implies that\n\nh \u00bc rpvp \u00bc rava \u00f03:17\u00de\nTherefore,\n\n?v2 \u00bc vc2 ? va \u00bc\nffiffiffiffi\n?\nra\n\nr\n? rp\n\nra\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2?\nrp\n\n? 2?\nrp \u00fe ra\n\ns\n\n\u00bc\nffiffiffiffi\n?\nra\n\nr\n1?\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2\n\n1\u00fe ra\nrp\n\nvuut\n2\n664\n\n3\n775 \u00f03:18\u00de\n\ntransfer orbit\n\nC2\n\nC1\n\nrp\n\nravC2\n\nvC1\nvp\n\nDv1\n\nDv2\n\nvaFig. 3.7 Outward Hohmann\ntransfer\n\n3.4 Orbit Transfer and Adjustment 73\n\n\n\nThe total ?v required for the Hohmann transfer is\n\n?vTotal \u00bc ?v1 \u00fe ?v2 \u00bc\nffiffiffiffi\n?\n\nrp\n\nr ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi2 ra\nrp\n\n1 \u00fe ra\nrp\n\nvuut 1? rp\nra\n\n? ?\n\u00fe\n\nffiffiffiffi\nrp\n\nra\n\nr\n? 1\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 \u00f03:19\u00de\n\nInward Hohmann Transfer\nIn Fig. 3.8, we are still calling the velocity increment performed on the outer circle\n\n?v2 to keep the notation the same as for the outward transfer.\nAs above,\n\n?vTotal \u00bc ?v1 \u00fe ?v2 scalars\u00f0 \u00de\nThe energy is reduced twice.\n\nRemarks:\n\n1. To transfer between two circular, coplanar orbits about the same body, the\n\nHohmann transfer requires the minimum total impulsive ?v for a\ntwo-maneuver sequence. In fact, each maneuver provides the minimum ?v to\nachieve the required energy change to reach the other circular orbit. We will not\n\nprove this statement of the optimality of the Hohmann transfer, but rather cite the\n\nfollowing references with respect to the topic. In particular, the references by\n\nBarrar and Prussing 1992 give such proofs.\n\nReferences: Barrar, Hohmann, Lawden, and Prussing 1992\n\n2.

Going to a higher number of impulses does not reduce the total ?v required for\nimpulsive maneuvers. That is, if ra? 11.94 rp, the Hohmann transfer requires the\nleast total impulsive ?v for an n-maneuver sequence for any n. If ra> 11.94 rp,\nthe bi-elliptic transfer requires the least total impulsive ?v for an n-maneuver\nsequence.\n\nReference: Ting\n\n4.

Once at a\npoint whose distance is much greater than the ra of Hohmann transfer, the\n\ncorresponding ?v to raise periapsis is small. Therefore, the final reverse ?v plus\nthe extra ?v applied to the first maneuver may be less than the ?v required to raise\nthe periapsis to ra in the second burn of Hohmann transfer (for impulsive ?vs).\n\nFor a proof of the optimality of the bi-elliptic transfer, we cite the reference by\n\nHoelker and Silber.\n\nThe major disadvantage of the bi-elliptic transfer is that the transfer time is more\n\nthan twice the Hohmann transfer time, while the ?v saving is modest. Increasing\nthe transfer time increases operational costs. When the initial and final orbits are not\n\nin the same plane, significant ?v savings can be realized as discussed in Sect. 3.6.\n\nExamples: Hohmann Transfer\n\nComparison of a Hohmann Transfer to Escape from a Low-Altitude\nCircular Orbit\nAn escape trajectory will take the spacecraft out of the gravitational field of one\n\ncentral body and into the gravitational field of another. For example, a spacecraft in\n\norbit about the earth may be moved into a heliocentric orbit by increasing its speed\n\nwith respect to the earth to escape speed, i.e., moving it into a parabolic orbit with\n\nrespect to the earth as shown in Fig. 3.10.

(See Exercise 3.19.)\n\n3.5 Interplanetary Trajectories\n\nIn this section, we study two types of interplanetary trajectories. For a flyby\n\nmission, Fig. 3.14 shows that the spacecraft has been launched into a circular\n\nparking orbit about the earth. From there, the craft performs a propulsive maneuver\n\nto transfer into a hyperbolic trajectory about the earth. When it moves into the sun\u2019s\n\ngravity field, it transfers into an elliptical orbit about the sun. As it approaches\n\nVenus, it enters a hyperbola about that planet. When it leaves Venus, it enters\n\nanother heliocentric ellipse that is not the same one as it traveled in before Venus\n\nencounter. So Venus has changed the spacecraft\u2019s trajectory. For the orbiter mis-\n\nsion, the trajectory is the same until arrival at Venus, when a Venus Orbit Insertion\n\n(VOI) is performed. This maneuver decreases the spacecraft\u2019s energy with respect\n\nto Venus so that the spacecraft inserts into an elliptical orbit about the planet.\n\nHyperbolic Trajectories\n\nLet e> 1.\nAs shown in Fig. 3.15, the spacecraft travels along the incoming asymptote until\n\nit is attracted by the gravitational force of the large body at F, which causes it to\n\nra1 rp1\n\nDv1,2\n\nDv2,2\n\nFig. 3.13 Alternate\nmaneuver sequence\n\n3.5 Interplanetary Trajectories 81\n\n\n\nellipse about\n\ncircular\nparking orbit\n\nhyperbolic\ntrajectory, about\n\nellipse\nabout\nif no\ninsertion\nmaneuver\n\nvhyp\n\nvellipse\n\nDvVOI\n\nellipse\nabout sun\n\nhyperbolic\nescape trajectory,\n\nat \u00c5\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u00b9\n\nellipse about\n\nellipse about\n\n+\n\n+\n\nFig. 3.14 Interplanetary trajectories.

The v1 is determined by the interplanetary\nflight path and the injection vehicle capability.\n\nOut-going asymptote\n\nincoming asymptote\n\nF\n|a|\n\n|b|\nr\n\nB\n\nFig. 3.16 Impact vector B\n\n86 3 Orbital Maneuvers\n\n\n\nGravity Assist\n\nConsider a spacecraft that is in orbit about the primary body and has an encounter\n\nwith a secondary body, e.g., primary body is the sun and the secondary is a planet.\n\nDefine:\n\nv?, v+\u00bc the inertial spacecraft (absolute) velocity vectors with respect to the\nprimary body before and after the flyby of the secondary body, respectively.\n\nv1/sec\n? , v1/sec\n\n+ \u00bc the spacecraft velocity vectors at infinity with respect to the sec-\nondary body before (incoming v1) and after (outgoing v1) the flyby, respectively.\nvsec\u00bc the secondary body\u2019s inertial velocity vector with respect to the primary body\nat the time of the encounter. (In the example, vsec is the planet\u2019s heliocentric\n\nvelocity vector.)\n\nThe spacecraft travels along a heliocentric trajectory to approach the target\n\nsecondary body. The absolute velocity vector on approach is v? and the incoming\nv1 with respect to the secondary body is v\n\n?? vsec as shown in Fig. 3.17a. The\nspacecraft encounters the secondary body and, after the flyby, its relative velocity\n\nvector approaches the outgoing velocity vector v1/sec\n+. The outgoing absolute\n\nvelocity vector is v+\u00bc v1/sec+ + vsec.\nDuring the encounter the v1/sec is rotated through ? deg as shown in Fig. 3.17b.\n\nIts magnitude does not change because energy is conserved with respect to the\n\nsecondary body (2-body mechanics). However, there is a change in the magnitude\n\nand/or direction of the v with respect to the primary body. This change adds a\n\n?vGA\u00bc v+? v? to the spacecraft\u2019s velocity as shown in Fig. 3.17b.\n\nsec vsec\n\nvsec\n\nvsec\nv-\u00a5/sec\n\nv+\u00a5/sec\n\nv-\n\nDvGAv-\n\nv+\n\nv+\n\nv-\u00a5/sec\n\nv+\u00a5/sec\nd\n\na\n\nb\n\nFig. 3.17 (a) Gravity assist flyby. (b) Effects of gravity assist\n\n3.5 Interplanetary Trajectories 87\n\n\n\nThe change in spacecraft energy with respect to the primary is provided through\n\nan exchange of energy with the secondary body, i.e., from the angular momentum\n\nof the secondary in orbit about the primary to the spacecraft. Since the secondary\n\nbody is many times more massive than the spacecraft, the velocity change of the\n\nsecondary is insignificant.\n\nThus, we have the following equations.\n\nRelative approach velocity:\n\nv?1= sec \u00bc v? ? vsec \u00f03:39\u00de\n\nAbsolute approach velocity:\n\nv? \u00bc vsec \u00fe v?1= sec \u00f03:40\u00de\n\nAbsolute departure velocity:\n\nv\u00fe \u00bc vsec \u00fe v\u00fe1= sec \u00f03:41\u00de\n\nNote the assumption that vsec and rsec are constant during the flyby. This is\nsimilar to the impulsive maneuver assumption and is based on the fact that the\n\nduration of the flyby is much less than the period of the secondary.\n\nThe change in absolute velocity is\n\n?vGA \u00bc v\u00fe ? v? \u00bc v\u00fe1= sec ? v?1= sec \u00f03:42\u00de\n\nNote: This equation is a vector subtraction.\n\nDef.: The use of a celestial body to change the velocity of a spacecraft during a\n\nflyby is called the gravity assist technique of navigation.\n\nFigure 3.18a displays the hyperbolic trajectory for a spacecraft that passes in front\n\nof the secondary body. Figure 3.18b displays the vector diagram for this trajectory.\n\nNote that the v+1/sec and v\n?\n1/sec shown in Fig. 3.18b are drawn parallel to the\n\ncorresponding vectors in Fig. 3.18a. Figure 3.19a exhibits the hyperbolic trajectory\n\nfor passage behind the secondary body and Fig. 3.19b gives the corresponding vector\n\ndiagram. The v1 vectors in Fig. 3.19b are also parallel to the v1 vectors in\nFig. 3.19a. Note that Figs. 3.15 and 3.19a show the special case in which the rp is\n\nalong the vsec. Also, the secondary body is designated as F in these figures.\n\nBy selecting the spacecraft\u2019s trajectory to pass in front of or behind the second-\n\nary body, the orbital energy of the spacecraft can be decreased or increased,\n\nrespectively. This fact can be seen by observing that, in the vector diagram\n\nFig. 3.18, the magnitude of the incoming v1 vector is greater than the magnitude\nof the outgoing vector and that the reverse is true in Fig. 3.19b. Figures 3.18\n\nand 3.19b display the result given in Eq. (3.42).\n\nThe concept of gravity assist was documented as early as the late 1700s by\n\nD\u2019Alembert and Laplace.

The spacecraft would leave a LEO\n\nparking orbit on a hyperbolic escape trajectory, then travel on a heliocentric trajec-\n\ntory to a Venus hyperbolic flyby and continue on into a different heliocentric ellipse.\n\nComments:\n\n1. Each segment is a 2-body problem. In each segment, we use the ? (Gm) of the\ncentral body for that phase and the distance r to the center of that central body.\n\nThe Gm values are available from Exercise 2.3b.\n\n2. We use an inward Hohmann transfer ellipse with Venus at periapsis (rp\u00bc r?)and\nthe earth at apoapsis (ra\u00bc r\n) as shown in Fig. 3.20. Of course we do not insist\nthat a transfer from earth to another planet always be done via a Hohmann\n\ntransfer. But, by looking at a Hohmann transfer, we know we need at least the\n\namount of ?v determined for this transfer.\n3. We assume the motion of Venus and the spacecraft are in the ecliptic plane. (But\n\nthe method can be applied to more general cases.) We assume all the orbits are\n\ncoplanar.\n\n4. We assume the orbits of the earth and Venus and the parking orbit are circular.\n\n5. Def.: The sphere of influence of a celestial body is the region in three-\n\ndimensional space in which its gravitational force is the dominant gravitational\n\nforce.\n\nDef.: A zero sphere of influence means that the gravitational force is modeled as\n\nbeing applied impulsively at the celestial body.\n\nTheVenus-flyby example uses the zero sphere of influence assumption at earth\n\nand Venus to include the effects of the masses of these bodies on the trajectory.\n\nearth\u2019s\norbit\n\ninjection Dv made here\nby Dv1\n\nno Dv here\nno Dv2\n\nVenus\u2019\norbit\n\ntransfer orbit\n\nsun\n2a = r\u00c5 + r+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nr\n\nr\u00c5\n\nv-/\n\nv+/\u00c5\n\nFig. 3.20 Inward Hohmann transfer to Venus\n\n3.5 Interplanetary Trajectories 91\n\n\n\n6.

That is, the spacecraft is passing between the sun and the\n\nsecondary. \u201cDark side\u201d refers to the side of the secondary opposite the sun, the\n\nnight side. \u201cIn front of\u201d means that the spacecraft passes through the path of the\n\nsecondary in front of the secondary, i.e., before the secondary gets to the point in\n\nthe orbit where the spacecraft crosses the secondary\u2019s orbit. \u201cPassing behind\u201d\n\nrefers to crossing the orbit of the secondary after the secondary has gone through\n\nthat point in its orbit. So, as a word of caution, \u201csunlit side\u201d does not refer to\n\npassage in front of the secondary and \u201cdark side\u201d does not refer to passage\n\nbehind the secondary.

We will ignore the difference for simplicity. I encourage you to consider\nboth of these models to determine the significance of this approximation.\n\nAfter earth escape, the heliocentric transfer begins along an ellipse about the\n\nsun. We make the escape trajectory at earth produce the heliocentric ellipse.\n\nThat is, we patch together a hyperbola about the earth and a heliocentric ellipse,\n\nwhich has the velocity vector needed to arrive at Venus.\n\n94 3 Orbital Maneuvers\n\n\n\nHyperbolic Approach at Venus\n1. Velocities at Venus Approach\n\nAt Venus, the spacecraft is moving faster at the periapsis of its orbit than Venus.\n\nThis trajectory is an inward Hohmann transfer without the ?v performed at\nVenus. The velocity at Venus, ignoring the presence of Venus, is v?\u00bc the\nabsolute (inertial) velocity at approach to Venus.\n\nFrom the conservation of angular momentum, Eq. (3.17),\n\nht \u00bc r\nv\u00fe \u00bc r?v? \u00f03:53\u00de\nwhere the v+ is at earth and the v? is at Venus and r? is the mean distance\nbetween Venus and the sun.

So the Galileo could not\n\nrely on a liquid upper stage. But a solid rocket could not fly a direct trajectory.

The T axis is parallel to a reference\n\nplane (e.g., the equator of the target body or the ecliptic plane); the S axis is along\n\nthe direction of the incoming asymptote; and the R axis completes the right-handed\n\ncoordinate system.\n\nDef.: The impact vector B is the vector in the B plane from the center of mass of the\n\ntarget body to the intersection of the spacecraft\u2019s incoming asymptote with the B\n\nplane. We call the magnitude of the B vector the \u201cimpact parameter.\u201d\n\nNote: The \u201ctip\u201d of the B vector is the point where the incoming asymptote\n\npierces the B-plane, not the trajectory.\n\nFigure 3.39 shows the relative size of the interplanetary aiming zones for several\n\nNASA missions. Since the missions considered in this figure have been completed,\n\nthe aiming (success) zones have shrunk drastically.\n\nFig. 3.37 Messenger\u2019s EV2M3 trajectory.

Finally, there is the actual trajectory that we\n\nwill never know exactly, although we will get better and better solutions for it as we\n\nreconstruct the trajectory. The maneuver will be applied to the actual trajectory.\n\nWe will not achieve the nominal impact point exactly because of the OD errors\n\nexperienced when estimating the trajectory and maneuver execution errors experi-\n\nenced in executing the TCM, plus other errors we will discuss in Chap. 5.\n\nThe reasons for using the B plane in these analyses are:\n\n1. It provides an initial guess for the ?v that leads to rapid convergence to the final\nvelocity correction, using precision software.\n\n2. Errors experienced at the TCM can be mapped linearly to delivery errors in the\n\nB-plane for analyzing and comparing OD solutions. (We state this result without\n\nproof, leaving the derivation to an OD course that uses a textbook such as TSB.)\n\nAn analog to the B plane is used for Rutherford scattering, which is an inverse\n\nsquare central force, but is a repulsive force.\n\nLet\n\nB \u00bc B?

The reference by\n\nHintz 1982 describes such a tradeoff process and its applications to the Pioneer\n\nVenus Orbiter mission. This method uses parametric data spanning a region of\n\nacceptable targeting aimpoints in the delivery space, plus geometric considerations.\n\nTrajectory redesign features exercised in flight illustrate the insight made available\n\nin solving the interplanetary targeting and orbit insertion maneuver (OIM)\n\nproblems. Real-time maneuver adjustments accounted for known attitude control\n\nerrors, orbit determination updates, and late changes in a targeting specification. An\n\nelementary maneuver reconstruction technique is also considered.\n\n3.5 Interplanetary Trajectories 109\n\n\n\n3.6 Other Spacecraft Maneuvers\n\nWe have looked at in-plane maneuvers between elliptic orbits. Next, we will\n\nconsider an in-plane maneuver from a hyperbolic trajectory to an elliptical one.\n\nOrbit Insertion\n\nFigure 3.41 shows a 40-min powered flight from the approach hyperbolic trajectory\n\ninto an elliptical trajectory about Mars. In performing this maneuver, the line of\n\napsides on the hyperbola is rotated 20? to the line of apsides on the ellipse. Notice\nthat our impulsive burn model will not accurately model this MOI maneuver. In our\n\nexercises, we will simplify our model so that there is no apsidal rotation and the\n\nmaneuver is impulsive.\n\nExamples:\n\n1.

(We will\n\ndiscuss rockets and propellants in Sect. 3.7.)\n\n3. Mars Odyssey (2001)\n\nFigure 3.42a shows the sequence of events in performing the MOI for the 2001\n\nMars Odyssey spacecraft. Times are given relative to the start of MOI.\n\nFigure 3.42b shows how the trajectory was viewed from earth, whereas\n\nFig. 3.42a is rotated to show all the events. Notice that the spacecraft disappeared\n\nfrom our view during the burn and completed the burn during the occultation.\n\nThe engineers working in Mars Odyssey operations did not know if the burn had\n\nbeen performed nominally until after the end of the occultation, a DSN antenna\n\nacquired the spacecraft, and the OD data were processed on earth.\n\nThe measure of the price we pay for needing to perform finite burns instead of\n\nimpulsive maneuvers is the gravity losses, which are defined as follows.\n\nDef.: Gravity losses (or finite burn losses)\u00bc finite burn ?v? impulsive ?v.\nThere are two kinds of finite burn losses during an insertion burn:\n\n1. The ?v is not applied exactly at periapsis on the hyperbolic trajectory.\n2. The ?v is not applied exactly along the velocity vector.\n\nThe ?v is usually fixed in inertial space. An exception was the SOI performed\nat Saturn by Cassini, which rotated during the burn to reduce the offset of the ?v\nfrom the velocity vector. Thus, the finite burn losses were reduced.\n\nExample (impulsive ?v computation for orbit insertion):\n\nIn Exercise 3.16, you will compute the magnitude of the impulsive ?v that\nwould transfer the spacecraft from the hyperbolic approach trajectory to an\n\nelliptical orbit about the target body. This transfer is accomplished by\n\nsubtracting the ?v from the velocity vector on the approach trajectory at\nperiapsis to acquire the elliptical orbit as shown in Fig. 3.43.\n\nPlane Rotation\n\nSo far we have looked at maneuvers that are in the orbit plane. Next we will add a\n\n?v that is not in the orbit plane so that the spacecraft will move into another orbit\nplane. We begin by making the following definition.\n\nDef.: A pure rotation maneuver is a spacecraft maneuver that changes the orbit\n\nplane without changing the orbit shape or energy.\n\nIn a pure rotation maneuver, all the velocity change goes into plane change, just\n\nas before when all of the velocity change produced in-plane changes of energy or\n\nshape. By defining such a maneuver, we are able to produce orthogonal vectors that\n\nwill add to achieve both the required in-plane and out-of-plane changes.\n\n3.6 Other Spacecraft Maneuvers 111\n\n\n\nMars Orbit Insertiona\n\nb\n\nBurn Start\n+00:00:00\n\nBurn Start\n+00:00:00\n\nBurn End\n+00:19:44\n\nEnter Earth Occult\n+00:09:37\n\nEnter Earth Occult\n+00:09:37\n\nExit Earth Occult\n+00:29:24\n\n2001 Mars Odyssey\n\n2001 Mars Odyssey\n\nExit Earth Occult\n+00:29:24\n\nEnter Solar Eclipse\n+00:09:59\n\nExit Solar Eclipse\n+00:11:46\n\nPeriapsis - 328 km\n+00:12:51\n\nMOI - View from Earth\n\nFig. 3.42 MOI for 2001 mars odyssey.

Therefore,?v is less at the node line crossing point closer to apoapsis than at\nthe only other candidate maneuver point.\n\nCombined Maneuvers\n\nWe can obtain a plane change and in-orbit parameter change by one maneuver as a\n\nvector sum of ?vs as shown in Fig. 3.45. The in-plane ?v will change the size\nand/or shape of the orbit. The out-of-plane ?v will change the plane of the orbit.\n\nIf both a plane change and a large in-plane correction are required, the spacecraft\n\ncan perform the combined ?v, which is not much more than the out-of-plane ?v.\nExample: Recall the bi-elliptic transfer described in Fig. 3.9. The ?v savings are\n\nmodest for an inplane bi-elliptic transfer. The bi-elliptictransfer may provide\n\nsignificant propellant savings if the initial and final orbits are not coplanar because\n\nthe required plane change can be accomplished at a larger radius and, therefore, for\n\na lower ?v.

Like any other\n\nkind of engine, a rocket is a device for converting one form of energy into another, and\n\nso it must be provided with a source of energy. This energy source may be chemical,\n\nnuclear, or electrical and rocket engines are often distinguished accordingly.\n\nDef.: The reaction force produced on a rocket as a result of the exhaust of the\n\nhigh-velocity exhaust gas is called the thrust.\n\nThe faster the exhaust gas flows out of the back of the rocket, the greater is the\n\nthrust of the rocket forward.\n\nThrust is generally stated in pounds of force. To lift a spacecraft off the ground,\n\nthe number of pounds of thrust by the launch vehicle must be greater than the\n\nnumber of pounds the launch vehicle/payload combination weights. For example,\n\nas Tony Simon wrote when referring to the launch of Apollo, \u201cthe ground shook,\n\nand for miles around everyone felt the thunderous power of Saturm V as its\n\n7,500,000 pounds of thrust lifted 6,500,000 pounds of weight\u201d.\n\nIn Field-Free Space\n\nModeling assumptions:\n\n1. Environment:We consider a rocket moving in a vacuum in \u201cgravity-free\u201d space, in\nwhich the only force acting is rocket thrust. This model is a useful approximation\n\nfor \u201chigh thrust\u201d engines, i.e., engines that provide thrust acceleration magnitudes\n\nthat are significantly higher than the local gravitational acceleration.\n\n2. Thrust model: Let the thrust, assumed constant, act continuously in one direc-\ntion. The rocket works by ejecting part of its mass at a high velocity; in assuming\n\nits thrust to be constant, we also assume the mass ejected per second and the\n\nexhaust velocity (measured with respect to the vehicle) to be constant.\n\nThe rocket mass is not constant during an engine burn. It decreases because\n\nsome mass is expelled out of the rocket nozzle to provide thrust, which is the\n\n116 3 Orbital Maneuvers\n\n\n\nreaction force in the opposite direction as predicted by Newton\u2019s Third Law of\n\nMotion. According to NII,\n\nF \u00bc d mv\u00f0 \u00de=dt \u00bc mdv=dt\u00fe vdm=dt \u00bc ma\nif m is constant. But, during a burn, dm/dt 6\u00bc 0 so F 6\u00bcma during maneuvers.\n\nFrom the conservation of linear momentum, we can equate the spacecraft\n\nmomentum plus the momentum of the exhaust particles at time t +?t to the\nmomentum of the system at t to get\n\nm\u00fe dm\u00f0 \u00de v\u00fe dv\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe v? ve\u00f0 \u00de ?dm\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc mv\nwhere v? ve is the velocity of the exhaust particles and ?dm> 0. Simplifying and\nnoting that dmdv is a product of smalls so it is negligible, we obtain\n\nmdv\u00fe vedm \u00bc 0\nSeparating variables and integrating, we obtain\n\nmdv \u00bc ?vedmZ tf\nt0\n\ndv \u00bc ?\nZ tf\nt0\n\nve\n\nm\ndm\n\nThe result is the Rocket Equation:\n\n?v \u00bc vf ? v0 \u00bc velnm0\nmf\n\nwhere vf denotes the velocity attained at the final time t\u00bc tf, v0 the initial velocity,\nm0 the initial mass, and mf the final mass.\n\nDef.: The exhaust velocity ve is the velocity of the expelled particles relative to\n\nthe rocket.\n\nThe exhaust velocity ve depends on the heat liberated per pound and on the\n\nmolecular weight. We want the heat liberated to be large and the molecular weight\n\nto be small.\n\nThe value of the thrust is dependent mainly on the product of the rate at which\n\nthe exhaust gasses are expelled, expressed as the mass per unit time, and the exhaust\n\nvelocity. While thrust is generally stated in pounds of force, it may be stated in\n\nNewtons (N), where\n\n1 N\u00bc 1 kg m/s2\n\nDef.: The specific impulse Isp is\n\nIsp \u00bc ve\ng\n\n\nwhere g\n is earth gravity at sea level.\n\n3.7 The Rocket Equation 117\n\n\n\nThis parameter is equal to\n\nve m\n?\n\ng\n m\n? \u00bc thrust\n\ngravity ? fuel mass flow rate \u00bc\nthrust\n\nweight ? flow? rate\nbecause\n\nthrust \u00bc bve \u00fe Ae Pe ?

Pa] is much smaller\nthan bve in the approximation. If Ae is measured in m\n\n2, then Pe and Pa are in N/m\n2.\n\nNote that we consider the ratio of thrust to weight flow rate because the term in the\n\nnumerator and that in the denominator can be measured accurately in the laboratory\n\n(error <1%).\nProperties:\n\n1. The specific impulse of a rocket propellant combination (fuel plus oxidizer) is\n\nthe number of seconds a pound of the propellant will produce a pound of thrust.\n\n2. The parameter Isp, usually quoted in seconds, is a measure of a propellant\u2019s\n\nperformance.\n\nThus, we obtain the Rocket Equation in the form\n\n?v \u00bc g\nIspln\nm0\n\nmf\n\u00f03:64\u00de\n\nwhere\n\nm0\u00bc spacecraft mass at the beginning of the burn\nmf\u00bc spacecraft mass at the end of the burn\ng\n \u00bc (constant) earth\u2019s gravity at sea level\u00bc 0.00980665 km/s2\u00bc 9.80665 m/s2\nIsp\u00bc (constant) specific impulse.\nNote: This is the form of the Rocket Equation that we will usually use in\n\nthis book.\n\nThe rocket equation was published by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in 1903.\n\nKonstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857\u20131935) was a Russian physicist and the theoretical\n\nfather of rocketry.\n\nTsiolkovsky was the son of a Polish deportee to Siberia. Tsiolkovsky was an\n\ninventor and aviation engineer who was also an insightful visionary. As early as\n\n1894, he designed a monoplane, which subsequently flew in 1915. He also built the\n\nfirst Russian wind tunnel in 1897. In 1903, as part of a series of articles in a Russian\n\naviation magazine, Tsiolkovsky published the rocket equation, and in 1929, a\n\ntheory of multistage rockets. Tsiolkovsky was also the author of Investigations of\nOuter Space by Rocket Devices (1911) and Aims of Astronauts (1914).\n\nOne of Tsiolkovsky\u2019s manymemorable and inspiring quotes is \u201cMankind will not\n\nforever remain on Earth, but in the pursuit of light and space will first timidly emerge\n\n118 3 Orbital Maneuvers\n\n\n\nfrom the bounds of the atmosphere, and then advance until he has conquered the\n\nwhole of circumsolar space\u201d (1911). Tsiolkovsky\u2019s most famous quote is, \u201cEarth is\n\nthe cradle of humanity, but one cannot remain in the cradle forever.\u201d\n\nReference: Eric W.

(3.67) and (3.68), we have assumed there are no other\n\nchanges in mass, such as dropping tanks, between or during the maneuvers. For the\n\ninjection of a spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit, the initial mass consists of the\n\nstructure of and propellant in the upper stage of the launch vehicle, plus the payload\n\n(spacecraft, including its propellant). The Isp for injection is the Isp of the propellant\n\nfor the upper stage. The structure of the upper stage is jettisoned after the injection,\n\nso it is not part of the initial mass for the orbital maneuvers.\n\nRemarks:\n\n1. A high thrust chemical engine has:\n\n\u2022 A moderate exhaust velocity (ve)\n\n\u2022 A high mass flow rate (m\n?\n\n) because of the large amount of combustion exhaust\n\nproducts flowing out of the nozzle.\n\n2. A low thrust engine, e.g., an ion engine, has:\n\n\u2022 A very high specific impulse because ions are expelled at tremendously high\n\nspeeds (ve) and\n\n\u2022 A low thrust because the rate mass is expelled (m\n?\n\n) is extremely low.\n\nExample 1: Hayabusa (nee MUSES-C) used high-performance electric propulsion\nengines continuously in flight.\n\nExample 2: Deep Space 1 (DS1) used ion propulsion that provided 90 mN\u00bc 1/50\nlb. of thrust with Isp\u00bc 2,500\u20133,500 s.\nExample 3: NASA\u2019s Evolutionary Xeon thruster (NEXT) developed by NASA\nGlenn to provide a 7-kW ion thruster.\n\n3. Chemical rockets have demonstrated fuel efficiencies up to 35%; ion thrusters\n\nhave demonstrated fuel efficiencies over 90%.\n\n4. Ion thrusters must be used in a vacuum to operate at the available power levels.\n\n5. Ion thrusters cannot be used for launch because large amounts of thrust are\n\nneeded to escape the earth\u2019s gravity and atmosphere.\n\n3.7 The Rocket Equation 121\n\n\n\nIn a Gravitational Field at Launch\n\nFor launch, using a simplified model that omits forces such as atmospheric drag, the\n\nRocket Equation becomes:\n\nmdv \u00bc ?vedm?mgdt\n\ndv \u00bc ?ve dm\nm\n\n? gdt\n\nBy integrating, we obtain:\n\n?v \u00bc velnm0\nm\n\n?\nZ t\n0\n\ng h\u00f0 \u00dedt\n\nwhere h is the rocket\u2019s height above a reference point. For constant g, this result is:\n\n?v \u00bc velnm0\nm\n\n? gt \u00f03:69\u00de\n\nThe last term on the right-hand side of this equation is called a gravity loss term,\n\nbecause it represents a decrease in the velocity change due to the gravitational force\n\ncompared with the value for field-free space. The size of the gravity loss depends on\n\nthe burn time. For a given thrust maneuver, the burn time may be quite short for a\n\nvery high-thrust engine, in which case the gravity loss is small and perhaps\n\nnegligible compared with a lower-thrust engine that must burn for a longer time\n\nto perform the same velocity change.\n\nFor information about rocket payloads and staging and how to optimize the\n\nallocation of mass among launch vehicle stages, see Sects. 5.5 and 5.6 of the\n\nreference by Prussing and Conway.\n\nReferences for this chapter: Barrar; Brouke, 2001; Broucke and Prado;\n\nC.

Immediately\n\nbefore injection, the spacecraft\u2019s wet mass is 4,000 kg and its dry mass is\n\n1,000 kg. How much propellant is used in the injection maneuver if the launch\n\nvehicle is an Atlas/Centaur? Assume that the wet mass of the Centaur upper\n\nstage is 30,000 lbs., including the Centaur\u2019s structure and propellant.

You drew the relation of the hyperbolic flyby of Mars with the light side\n\npassage and the dark side passage.\n\nMy question is, when you drew it you had the S/C coming in from left to right on\n\nthe page and the velocity of Mars in the left direction (all relative to the page). If\n\nyou are doing a Hohmann transfer where the Earth is at rp at the \u201csouth side\u201d of the\n\norbit (wrt to the paper calling North up) and the S/C arrived at Mars when Mars was\n\nin the \u201cnorth side\u201d of its orbit, how could the S/C have incoming velocity vector\n\nfrom the left to right, which is opposite the velocity of Mars? Assuming all orbits\n\nare counterclockwise wouldn\u2019t the S/C approach Mars from right to left and V1\n?\n\nbe added to the velocity of Mars to get V?? I\u2019m a little confused.\nA: The reason why the spacecraft is shown entering from the left is that the\n\nplanet is moving faster than the spacecraft. So the S/C is moved into position in\n\nfront of the planet and the planet overtakes the S/C. If the S/C were to travel behind\n\nthe planet, the S/C would not be able to catch up to the planet and pass it. The figure\n\nthat shows the S/C traveling to the right is the picture of the 2-body model with the\n\nS/C in a hyperbolic trajectory about the planet. The motion in that picture is wrt the\n\nplanet. Recall that we break the patched conic trajectory model into four segments.\n\nThe picture you are looking at is the third segment, which shows motion wrt the\n\ntarget planet. It does not show motion wrt the sun, which would be much different.\n\n126 3 Orbital Maneuvers\n\n\n\nTechniques of Astrodynamics 4\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nWe now consider techniques used in the study of the controlled flight paths of\n\nhuman-made vehicles, beginning with algorithms for propagating the spacecraft\u2019s\n\ntrajectory and then defining Keplerian parameters, which describe the orbit\u2019s size,\n\nshape, and orientation.

For example, if the eccentric-\n\nity is near zero, the periapsis is not well defined, especially in the presence of small\n\nperturbations, which make the orbit non-Keplerian. If the inclination is near zero,\n\nthe line of nodes is not well defined.\n\nTo remove the singularities encountered at e\u00bc 0 and/or i\u00bc 0? or 180?, we often\nuse equinoctial elements, consisting of six elements that are defined in terms of the\n\nKeplerian elements that are used for elliptical orbits. Two references are: Broucke\n\nand Cefola, Battin 1999. An alternate form of the equinoctial element set is defined\n\nin the reference by Nacozy and Dallas.\n\n148 4 Techniques of Astrodynamics\n\n\n\nA set of modified equinoctial orbit elements is introduced in the references:\n\nWalker, Ireland and Owens 1985 and 1986. Modified equinoctial elements remove\n\nsingularities for all eccentricities and inclinations, including hyperbolic and para-\n\nbolic orbits.\n\nThere are more element sets. The survey provided in the reference Hintz 2008\n\ndiscusses 22 element sets plus variations.\n\nReferences for Keplerian Elements: BMW; Battin 1999; Broucke and Cefola;\n\nHintz 2008; Kaplan; Nacozy and Dallas; Pisacane and Moore, eds.; Walker,\n\nIreland, and Owens 1985, 1986.\n\n4.4 Lambert\u2019s Problem\n\nProblem Statement\n\nWe have looked at the problem of determining the position and velocity vectors at a\n\nspecified time t, given a set of initial conditions r0 and v0. In the relative 2-body\n\nproblem, the six numbers in r0 and v0 completely determine r(t) and v(t) for all\n\nt. We now look at the problem of determining flight paths about a central body of\n\nattraction and between two given points. For example, one point might be at the\n\nearth (representing the injection point) and the other at another planet (representing\n\nthe target body) as in Fig. 4.9. We determine families of heliocentric orbits that\n\ncould be followed. The selection of an orbit depends on energy considerations for\n\nthe launch vehicle at one end and planetary approach considerations, e.g., science\n\nrequirements, at the other.\n\nProblem: To determine a Keplerian orbit, having a specified flight time and\n\nconnecting two position vectors. Lambert\u2019s Problem is the 2-point boundary\n\nvalue problem with a specified time of flight for the relative 2-body problem.\n\nThis method was first stated and solved by Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728\u20131779).\n\nApplication: To obtain mission design curves, called \u201cpork chop plots,\u201d used to\n\ndesign trajectories that satisfy launch energy constraints and target body\n\nrequirements.\n\nEarth at departure\ndate LD\n\nc\nu\n\nat arrival date AD+\n\nFig. 4.9 Boundary points\nin Lambert\u2019s problem\n\n4.4 Lambert\u2019s Problem 149\n\n\n\nA Mission Design Application\n\nInterplanetary mission design:\n\n1. In the Patched Conics Example, using a Hohmann transfer required that the\n\nflight time\u00bc 146 days and we assumed that Venus is in the ecliptic plane and\nused the zero sphere of influence model. The conic segments fit together in\n\nposition and velocity vectors in an interplanetary trajectory model.\n\n2. In the Mission Design Curves, we assume massless planets, which implies that\n\nwe have only one conic that goes from the center of one planet to the center of\n\nthe other. However, we do not assume the target planet is in the ecliptic plane.\n\nThe energy at injection into the interplanetary elliptic trajectory about the sun is\n\nE I \u00bc v\n2\n1\n2\n\n\u00bc v\n2\nI\n\n2\n? ?\nRI\n\n\u00f04:47\u00de\n\nWe define the launch energy\n\nC3 \u00bc C3 \u00bc 2 E I \u00bc v12 \u00bc v2I ?\n2?\nRI\n\n\u00f04:48\u00de\n\nwhere vI\u00bc conic injection velocity and RI\u00bc the magnitude of the radius vector at\ninjection.\n\nAdditional parameters that will be used in the following discussion are:\n\nVHP\u00bc the arrival v1 at the target body,\nDLA\u00bc declination of the launch azimuth,\nTTIME\u00bcTFL\u00bc time of flight, and\n?\u00bcHCA\u00bc heliocentric angle between the two boundary vectors.\n\nWe also define the following trajectory types.\n\nDef.: A Type I trajectory is a trajectory from the earth to a target body that satisfies\n\n0<HCA< 180?\n\nDef.: A Type II trajectory is a trajectory from the earth to a target body that\n\nsatisfies\n\n180? <HCA< 360?\n\nWe now consider mission design curves known as \u201cpork chop plots,\u201d which are\n\ncontours of trajectory performance and geometry data as a function of launch and\n\narrival between two bodies orbiting the sun. Data types that are available include\n\nC3, VHP, and DLA. The C3 is the launch energy required for the spacecraft to\n\n150 4 Techniques of Astrodynamics\n\n\n\ntravel from the earth on the launch date (LD) to the target body on the arrival date\n\n(AD); TFL is the time between LD and AD; VHP denotes the arrival velocity at the\n\ntarget body; and DLA describes the launch direction when combined with the right\n\nascension of the launch azimuth.\n\nIn Fig. 4.10, the horizontal axis shows launch dates (LD) and the vertical axis\n\narrival dates (AD). In Fig. 4.10a, the blue contours are the LD/AD points that require\n\nthe C3 indicated and points inside the contour require less than that C3 to reach Venus\n\nfrom the earth. Note that the C3 contours become very steep nearing the Hohmann\n\ntransfer. This extremely large ?v at injection into the heliocentric transfer trajectory\nis required because of the large velocity change required to change the orbit plane\n\nfrom ecliptic to the Venus orbit plane.

The nominal launch day may be chosen on a C3 curve that satisfies the\n\nlaunch energy constraint on C3 as, for example, a spacecraft which provides\n\nC3\u00bc 15 km2/s2 for a nominal LD\u00bc 12/4/2016 and AD\u00bc 6/8/2017. Then, for\neach day the launch is postponed, the LD is delayed 1 day, but the AD is held\n\nfixed. Thus, the C3 decreases as the launch moves into the launch period. (This\n\nrequirement also accommodates the scientists because they have scheduled\n\nscience-data-taking at the target body that is time-dependent.) Note that this\n\nstrategy gives the spacecraft a launch period of 25 days that satisfy a requirement\n\nof C3? 15 km2/s2 as on the nominal launch day.\nThus, pork chop plots are employed for many mission planning purposes,\n\nincluding:\n\n1. To determine the launch date.\n\n2. To determine the arrival date at the target body.\n\n3. To provide a preliminary estimate of the amount of propellant to be carried\n\nonboard the spacecraft. This estimate dictates the launch vehicle to be used and/\n\nor the use of navigation and mission design strategies such as aerobraking at a\n\ntarget body that has an atmosphere.\n\n4. To provide information on the capture orbit when the spacecraft arrives at the\n\ntarget body. This information enables selecting the arrival date that minimizes\n\nthe amount of propellant used to brake the spacecraft\u2019s speed to allow it to be\n\ncaptured into orbit. It is also important to the scientists for meeting data-taking\n\nrequirements.\n\n5. To verify that launch constraints such as the DLA requirement for launching to\n\nthe ISS are met.\n\n6.

It is also called the Gauss\n\nproblem by some authors. R. Battin considers several methods of solving this\n\nproblem in An Introduction to the Mathematics and Methods of Astrodynamics\n(Chap. 7) and in his earlier book Astronautical Guidance (Chap. 3).\n\nOne of these methods is Gauss\u2019s method. In fact, the first real progress in the\n\nsolution of Lambert\u2019s Problem was made by Carl Friedrich Gauss2 in his book\n\nTheoria Motus Corporum Coelestium in Sectionibus Coicis Colem Ambientium\n(Theory of the Motion of the Heavenly Bodies Moving about the Sun in Conic\n\nSections) or Theoria Motus.\nR. Battin and R. Vaughan have developed a new (improved) method from\n\nGauss\u2019 method, which appears in the reference:\n\nRichard H. Battin and Robin M. Vaughan, \u201cAn Elegant Lambert Algorithm,\u201d\n\nJournal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics, Vol. 7, November\u2013December 1984.\nThis algorithm accomplishes two improvements:\n\n1. It moves a singularity for a transfer angle of 180?.\n2. It drastically improves the convergence for the entire range of transfer angles\n\nbetween 0? and 360?.\n\nReferences for Lambert\u2019s Problem: BMW; Battin 1999; Battin 1964; Battin and\n\nVaughan; Bell; Breakwell, Gillespie, and Ross; Kaplan; Lancaster and Blanchard;\n\nNASA\u2019s Mars Exploration Website; Prussing 1979; Roy; Schaub and Junkins;\n\nWeisstein\n\n4.5 Celestial Mechanics\n\nIn previous chapters, the central mass behaves like a particle, i.e., it is either a point\n\nmass or a body of uniform density.

We have the 2-body problem iff all Js, Cs, Ss\u00bc 0 so U\u00bcU(r, ?, ?)\u00bcGm/r.\n2. Since we cannot evaluate an infinite series, we truncate the infinite series. The\n\ntruncation errors are distributed over the coefficients that are kept in the\n\nexpansion. To show hills and valleys in the potential function, we increase\n\nthe number of terms used to get a finer grid.\n\n3. The Js, Cs, and Ss are definite integrals, but the integrations cannot be\n\nperformed because the density function ?(?, ?, ?) is unknown.\n4. Values of the coefficients can be determined from spacecraft observations. We\n\nuse a least squares method to solve for the Cs and Ss as described in the\n\nreference TSB.\n\n5. The moon has MASCONS, large concentrations of mass near the surface. The\n\nearth does not have these large-scale anomalies. Some analysts have modeled\n\nthe MASCONS and solved for their positions because of the computational\n\nproblems in solving for all the coefficients in the spherical harmonic expansion.\n\nSupercomputers now make such attempts unnecessary.\n\n6. If r>>Re, the effects of these anomalies are reduced.Only low orbits experience\nthe effects of the higher degree terms in a harmonic expansion of U. For such low\n\naltitude orbits, it is said that the spacecraft is \u201cbuffeted by the harmonics.\u201d\n\n7. Some of the Js, Cs, and Ss for the earth are estimated as in Table 4.2. Note that\n\nJ2? 3 orders of magnitude larger than the other values.\nRemarks about the Table of Spherical Harmonic Coefficients for the Earth:\n\n(a) Data is from the NASA-NIMA Earth Gravity Model EGM96\n\n(b) EGM96 is a 360? 360 Earth Gravity Field Model\n(c) For this model, Gm is 398,600.4415 km3/s2 and the mean equatorial radius\n\nof the earth is 6,378.1363 km.\n\n8. Some texts assume that C2\n1\u00bc S21\u00bc 0. Thus, they assume that the offset of the\n\nprincipal axis and the rotational axis is zero. This offset is very small, but it is\n\nnot zero. The assumption that these offsets are zero is not always done in\n\npractice; in fact, the analyst may solve for C2\n1 and S2\n\n1 and use the values\n\nobtained as verification that the results are correct. Obtaining larger values than\n\nexpected for C2\n1 and S2\n\n1 is an indication that something is wrong. Getting small\n\nvalues helps to verify the results.\n\n9. The spherical harmonics are orthogonal. This property makes the spherical\n\nharmonics the natural means for general (unique) representation of a function\n\nover a spherical surface.\n\n10. For numerical reasons, it is convenient to normalize the coefficients as\n\ndiscussed in the reference by Kaula.\n\n11.

The Bernoulli family tree included brothers\nJohann Bernoulli (1667\u20131748) aka John I. Bernoulli and Jakob Bernoulli (1654\u2013\n\n1705). The sons of Johann were Daniel Bernoulli (1700\u20131782) and Nicholas\n\nBernoulli (1695\u20131726). Daniel Bernoulli was a Swiss mathematician, who showed\n\nthat as the velocity of a fluid increases, the pressure decreases, a statement known as\n\nthe Bernoulli principle. He won the annual prize of the French Academy ten times\n\nfor work on vibrating strings, ocean tides, and the kinetic theory of gases. For one of\n\nthese victories, he was ejected from his jealous father\u2019s house, because his father\n\nhad also submitted an entry for the prize.\n\nA complete solution of the n-body problem requires that we solve for 6n\n\nquantities: three components of position and three components of velocity for\n\neach of n particles referred to an inertial reference frame. But only ten\n\nintegrals are known for use in reducing the order of the system of differential\n\nequations of motion to be solved. Recall that, in Chap. 2, we solved the relative\n\n2-body problem, which is often referred to as the \u201c2-body problem.\u201d Jules Henri\n\nPoincare (1854\u20131912), a French mathematician, proved that there are no more of\n\nthese constants.\n\nThe ten integrals are obtained as six from the conservation of total linear\n\nmomentum, three from the conservation of total angular momentum, and one\n\nfrom the conservation of total energy. See the reference by Kaplan, pp. 283\u2013285.\n\nJules Henri Poincare (1854\u20131912) was a French mathematician who did impor-\n\ntant work in many different branches of mathematics. However, he did not stay in\n\nany one field long enough to round out his work. He had an amazing memory and\n\ncould state the page and line of any item in a text he had read. He retained his\n\nmemory all his life. His normal work habit was to solve a problem completely in his\n\nhead, then commit the completed problem to paper. Poincare did fundamental work\n\nin celestial mechanics in his treatises Les Methodes Nouvelles de la Mecanique\nCeleste (1892, 1893, 1899) and Lecons de Mecanique Celeste (three volumes,\n1905\u20131910). In these works, he attacked the 3-body problem.\n\nDisturbed Relative 2-Body Motion\n\nSince the n-body problem cannot be solved analytically, we consider disturbed\n\nrelative 2-body motion to introduce the gravitational effects of a third body.\n\nDef.: Third body effects are the gravitational effects on a satellite produced by a\n\nbody other than the central body.\n\nExample (Pioneer Venus Orbiter): The Keplerian orbital parameters for PVO\n\nwere: ?\u00bc 24 h, hp? 200 km (However, the spacecraft did go as low as about\n140 km in altitude on the night side and as low as about 150 km on the day side\n\nso we could study the atmosphere of Venus by determining its effect on the\n\nspacecraft\u2019s orbit.), i\u00bc 105?, ?\u00bc 22.8?, and ?\u00bc 160.7? with respect to mean\necliptic and equinox of 1950.0 coordinates. (See the reference by Shapiro et al.)\n\n4.5 Celestial Mechanics 185\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_2\n\n\nThe dominant perturbation to 2-body (Keplerian) motion for PVO was solar\n\ngravity (third body effect of the sun). Figure 4.32 shows the spacecraft\u2019s altitude as\n\na function of days from entry into orbit about Venus. This figure is a parametric\n\ndisplay for three different launch dates, June 4, May 24, and May 16 in 1978. (PVO\n\nwas launched on May 20, 1978.) This figure assumes no trim maneuvers to correct\n\nfor the increasing altitude. In reality, the altitude was decreased as illustrated in\n\nFig. 4.33. Note that the altitude drift was over-corrected to reduce the number of\n\nTCMs required to keep the altitude within tolerances.\n\nWe look at relative 2-body motion with other bodies disturbing the motion as\n\nillustrated in Fig. 4.34. We consider n-bodies P1, P2, . . ., Pn with masses m1, m2, . . .,\nmn, respectively and ask the question: What is the motion of P2 with respect to P1,\n\ngiven gravitational disturbances by Pj, j\u00bc 3, . . ., n?\n\nINITIAL PERIAPSIS ALTITUDE  =  200 KM\n                            INCLINATION  = 105\u00b0 (TO ECLIPTIC)\n                                     PERIOD  = 24 HRS\n\nARRIVAL DATE  =  4 DEC 1978, 1800 UT\n                                (ORBIT DAY 0)\n\nLAUNCH DATE, 1978 \n\n4 JUNE\n\n24 MAY\n\n15 MAY\n\nORBITS WITH PERIAPSIS IN NORTHERN HEMISPHERE\n\n20\n0\n\n40\n0\n\n60\n0A\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n, k\nm\n\nOrbit Day\n\n80\n0\n\n10\n00\n\n12\n00\n\n14\n00\n\n00\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250\n\nFig. 4.32 Parametric display of orbital altitude drift for PVO\n\n186 4 Techniques of Astrodynamics\n\n\n\nExamples:\nPlanetary theory: P1\u00bc sun, P2\u00bc a specific planet, Pj\u00bc the other planets\n\nLunar (satellite) theory; P1\u00bc earth, P2\u00bcmoon (spacecraft), Pj\u00bc the sun and\nother planets\n\nDef.:\n\nr \u00bc r2 ? r1\n?j \u00bc rj ? r1\ndj \u00bc r? ?j \u00bc r2 ? rj\n\n\u00f04:93\u00de\n\nLet Fi\u00bc force of attraction on Pi.

Then P1 is used as\n\nthe origin of the inertial coordinates. When P2 is outside this sphere, the coordinate\n\nsystem is centered at P3.\n\nThe concept of sphere of influence originated with Pierre-Simon de Laplace\n\nwhen he was studying the motion of a comet that passed near Jupiter. In his orbit\n\ndetermination calculations, he searched for a logical criterion for choosing the\n\norigin of his coordinate system during various phases of the motion.\n\nThe sphere of influence for the planets and Pluto are given in Table 4.3.\n\nBattin [1999] says the following about Laplace:\n\nPierre-Simon de Laplace (1749\u20131827), mathematician and French politician\n\nduring the Napoleonic era, made many important discoveries in mathematical\n\nphysics and chemistry but most of his life was devoted to celestial mechanics.\n\nHis Mecanique celeste, consisting of five volumes, published between 1799 and\n1825, was so complete that his immediate successors found little to add. Unfortu-\n\nnately, his vanity kept him from sufficiently crediting the works of those whom he\n\nconsidered rivals.

To establish a system of\n\ntime, one must define two quantities: the unit of duration (e.g., the second or day),\n\nand the epoch, or zero, of the chosen time. In physics and astronomy, there are four\n\ntypes of time systems in common use. Broadly speaking, they are the following:\n\n1. Universal time, in which the unit of duration is the (mean) solar day, defined to\n\nbe as uniform as possible, despite variations in the rotation of the earth (see\n\nFig. 2.14).\n\n2. Atomic time, in which the unit of duration corresponds to a defined number of\n\nwavelengths of radiation of a specified atomic transition of a chosen isotope.\n\n4.6 Time Measures and Their Relationships 191\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_2#Fig14\n\n\n3. Dynamical time, in which the unit of duration is based on the orbital motion of\n\nthe earth, moon, and planets.\n\n4. Sidereal time, in which the unit of duration is the period of the earth\u2019s rotation\n\nwith respect to a point nearly fixed with respect to the stars.\n\nUniversal Time\n\nEffects of Changes in Earth\u2019s Rotation Rate\nAstronomers saw that the moon and planets did not appear where they were\n\nexpected. These discrepancies are introduced by variations in the translational\n\nand rotational motion of the earth, on which time systems have traditionally been\n\nbased. The eccentricity of the earth\u2019s orbit about the sun introduces translational\n\nvariations. Earth\u2019s rotation is not uniform for various reasons:\n\n1. Earth\u2019s rotation is gradually slowing down from tidal friction of the moon on the\n\nearth\u2019s oceans. (See Sect. 5.7.)\n\n2. The positions of the North and South Poles wander around by a few meters from\n\n1 year to the next due to seasonal effects and rearrangements in the internal\n\nstructure of the earth (implies maybe a 30 ms change).\n\n3. There are also changes in the spin rate of the earth, causing variations in the\n\nlength of the day as described in the article located at the Website: http://www.\n\njpl.nasa.gov/earth/features/longdays.html\n\nThis variation is about 1 ms over a year, increasing gradually over the winter for\n\nthe Northern Hemisphere and decreasing during the summer. \u201cThere are also longer\n\npatterns of changes in the length of day that last decades, even centuries.\u201d\n\nIntroduction of Universal Time\nThese irregularities cause the earth to be a somewhat irregular clock. Therefore,\n\nthree different scales of time called \u201cuniversal time\u201d (UT0, UT1, and UT2) have\n\nbeen developed as follows:\n\n1. UT0 is the scale generated by the mean solar day. Thus, UT0 corrects for the\n\ntilted earth moving around the sun in an elliptical orbit.\n\n2. UT1 (a more uniform scale) is UT0 corrected for the polar motion of the earth.\n\n(We use UT1.)\n\n3. UT2 is UT1 corrected for the regular slowing down and speeding up of the\n\nearth\u2019s spin rate in winter and summer.\n\nUniversal time is the mean solar time at Greenwich, England, defining the zero\n\nepoch from which UT is measured.\n\n192 4 Techniques of Astrodynamics\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_5#Sec18\nhttp://www.jpl.nasa.gov/earth/features/longdays.html\nhttp://www.jpl.nasa.gov/earth/features/longdays.html\n\n\nAtomic Time\n\nInternational Atomic Time (TAI)\nAtomic time is based on the Syste?me International (SI) second (atomic second),\n\nwhich is defined as the elapsed time of 9,192,631,770 \u201coscillations of the undis-\n\nturbed cesium atom.\u201d Atomic time is equal to a count of atomic seconds (SI) since\n\nthe astronomically determined instant of midnight January 1, 1958 00:00:00 at the\n\nRoyal Observatory in Greenwich, England. TAI is kept by the International Earth\n\nRotation Service (IERS\u2014formerly the Bureau International L\u2019Heure, BIH) in\n\nParis, France. Practically speaking, this time is updated as a weighted average of\n\nmany atomic clocks corrected to sea level around the world.\n\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC)\nAtomic time is regular. So the irregularity of the earth\u2019s rotation rate implies that\n\nUT and TAI will get out of step. Therefore, the \u201cleap second\u201d was invented in 1972.\n\nUTC is always to be within 0.9 s of UT1. IERS notifies the world when a leap\n\nsecond is to be added or subtracted (always added so far) at the end of June or\n\nDecember.\n\nNotice that the acronym for Coordinated Universal Time is \u201cUTC\u201d. This order of\n\nthe letters was chosen to be no one\u2019s acronym, so people will not be jealous because\n\nthe acronym is not from their language as in the French acronyms \u201cSI\u201d and \u201cTAI.\u201d\n\nDynamical Time\n\nEphemeris Time\nIn 1952, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) introduced Ephemeris Time\n\n(ET), based on the occurrence of astronomical events, to cope with the irregularities\n\nin the earth\u2019s rotation that affected the flow of mean solar time. The uniform time\n\nscale ET is the independent variable (dynamical time) in the differential equations\n\nof motion of the planets, the sun, and moon. In 1976, the IAU introduced two\n\ndynamical times that are often called ephemeris time:\n\n(a) Barycentric Dynamical Time (BDT) used when describing the motion of bodies\n\nwith respect to the solar system barycenter.\n\n(b) Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TDT) used when describing the motion of objects\n\nnear the earth.\n\nRelativistic Time Scales\nWhile time is an absolute quantity in the context of Newtonian physics, which does\n\nnot depend on the location and the motion of the clock, the same is no longer true in\n\na general relativistic framework. Instead, different proper times apply for clocks\n\nthat are related to each other by a four-dimensional space-time transformation.\n\nGeocentric Coordinate Time (TCG) represents the time coordinate of a four-\n\ndimensional reference system.\n\n4.6 Time Measures and Their Relationships 193\n\n\n\nSidereal Time\n\nApart from the inherent motion of the equinox due to precession and nutation,\n\nsidereal time is a direct measure of the diurnal rotation of the earth. In general\n\nterms, sidereal time is the hour angle of the vernal equinox, i.e., the angle between\n\nthe mean vernal equinox of date and the Greenwich meridian. Observatories\n\nmeasure sidereal time by observing celestial objects. The observation data are\n\nused to solve for UT1. Apparent sidereal time is the hour angle of the true equinox\n\n(the intersection of the true equator of date with the ecliptic plane), which is\n\naffected by the earth\u2019s nutation. Mean sidereal time is measured to the mean\n\nequinox of date, which is affected by precession.\n\nJulian Days\n\nThe Julian day system provides a unique number to all days that have elapsed since\n\na selected standard reference day, January 1, 4713 B.C., in the Julian calendar. The\n\ndays are in mean solar measure. The Julian day (JD) numbers are never repeated\n\nand are not partitioned into weeks or months. Therefore, the number of days\n\nbetween two dates can be obtained by subtracting Julian day numbers.\n\nThere are 36,525 mean solar days in a Julian century and 86,400 s in a day. The\n\nJulian century does not refer to a particular time system; but rather is merely a count\n\nof a fixed number of days. Ephemeris calculations are done in Julian days and Julian\n\ncenturies.\n\nA Julian day starts at noon UT instead of midnight, an astronomical custom that\n\nis followed to avoid having the day number change during a night\u2019s observations.\n\nJulian days can be calculated from calendar dates between the years 1901 A.D. and\n\n2099 A.D. as follows:\n\nJ \u00bc 367Y? int 7 Y\u00fe int M\u00fe 9\u00f0 \u00de=12\u00f0 \u00de\n4\n\n\t \n? ?\n\u00fe int 275M\n\n9\n\n\t \n\n\u00fe D\n\n\u00fe 1, 721, 013:5 \u00f04:100\u00de\nwhere J denotes the Julian day number, Y (expressed as yyyy) the calendar year,\n\nM the calendar month number, D the calendar day and fraction, and int denotes the\n\ngreatest integer in the argument.\n\nFor more information on time and time scales, see the references: Jespersen and\n\nFitz-Randolph, and Seidelmann.\n\nWhat Time Is It in Space?\n\nKeeping tabs on a spacecraft way out at Saturn can get complicated.

Here are some definitions to help you keep tabs\n\non mission time:\n\nCoordinated Universal Time (UTC): The worldwide scientific standard of\ntimekeeping\n\nIt is based upon carefully maintained atomic clocks and is highly stable. The\n\naddition or subtraction of leap seconds, as necessary, at two opportunities every\n\nyear adjusts UTC for irregularities in Earth\u2019s rotation.\n\nSpacecraft Event Time (SCET): The time something happens at the spacecraft, such\nas a science observation or engine burn.\n\nOne-Way Light Time (OWLT): The time it takes for a signal\u2014which moves at the\nspeed of light through space\u2014to travel from the spacecraft to Earth. From Saturn,\n\none-way light time can range from about 1 h and 14 min to 1 h and 24 min.\n\nEarth Received Time (ERT): The time the spacecraft signal is received at mission\ncontrol on Earth (the Spacecraft Event Time plus One-Way Light Time).\n\nLocal Time: Time adjusted for locations around the Earth. This is the time most\npeople use to set watches and alarm clocks.\n\nFor example, Cassini began transmitting data from its very first close Titan flyby\n\nat 00:16 SCET on Oct. 27. The first signal arrived at Earth 1 h and 14 min later at\n\n01:30 SCET on Oct. 27.\n\nAdjusting for local time, the signals arrived on the screens at mission control in\n\nPasadena, California at 6:30 p.m. PDT (or 9:30 p.m. EDT for folks tuned in at\n\nNASA headquarters in Washington, D.C.)\n\nYou can use a time zone converter or the chart in Table 4.4 to figure out when\n\nCassini\u2019s signals would reach your house.\n\nTable 4.4 Time zone\nconverter chart\n\nTime zone Relative time (from UTC)\n\nAtlantic Daylight Subtract 3 h\n\nAtlantic Standard Subtract 4 h\n\nEastern Daylight Subtract 4 h\n\nEastern Standard Subtract 5 h\n\nCentral Daylight Subtract 5 h\n\nCentral Standard Subtract 6 h\n\nMountain Daylight Subtract 6 h\n\nMountain Standard Subtract 7 h\n\nPacific Daylight Subtract 7 h\n\nPacific Standard Subtract 8 h\n\nAlaska Daylight Subtract 8 h\n\nAlaska Standard Subtract 9 h\n\nHawaii\u2013Aleutian Daylight Subtract 9 h\n\nHawaii\u2013Aleutian Standard Subtract 10 h\n\nSamoa Standard Subtract 11 h\n\n4.6 Time Measures and Their Relationships 195\n\nhttp://time.gov/#_blank\n\n\nReference: http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/saturntourdates/saturntime/\n\n[accessed 1/10/2014]\n\nReferences for this chapter: BMW; Battin 1964; Battin 1999; Battin and\n\nVaughan; Bell; Bergam and Prussing; Bills and Ferrari; Breakwell, Gillespie, and\n\nRoss; Broucke 1980; Broucke and Cefola; Cassini Equinox Mission Website;\n\nCassini Solstice Mission Website; C.

Only the relative 2-body problem can be solved analytically.\n\n2. It is often a good approximation to the real solution, because the gravitational\n\nforce of the central body is much greater than perturbing forces.\n\n3. It provides an understandable and illustrative picture of the situation, which can\n\nbe used in feasibility studies and verification of results.\n\n4. It can be used as a reference trajectory for precise trajectory determination\n\ntechniques.\n\nBut forces other than the central body\u2019s gravitational force act on the satellite to\n\nperturb it away from the Keplerian orbit, giving non-Keplerian motion. In this\n\nchapter, we transition from Keplerian motion to non-Keplerian by identifying\n\ntypes of perturbations, using perturbation techniques, and drawing from the\n\nastrodynamics techniques described in Chap. 4. We study the effects of the oblate-\n\nness of the central body on a spacecraft\u2019s orbit, using the potential function of an\n\noblate body as described in Chap. 4. An important mission application is the sun\n\nsynchronous orbit. Finally, we culminate our study of non-Keplerian motion by\n\nconsidering the satellite orbit paradox and its applications to atmospheric drag,\n\nlibration of 24-h, nearly circular equatorial satellites, and the fact that the moon is\n\nslowly moving away from the earth, plus a discussion of \u201czero G.\u201d\n\n5.2 Perturbation Techniques\n\nWe consider methods for including perturbations to Keplerian motion in our\n\nanalyses.\n\n# Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015\nG.R.

Gravitational forces of other attracting bodies (\u201c3rd body effects), e.g., solar 3rd\n\nbody effects on PVO as shown in Fig. 4.32.\n\n2. Gravitational forces resulting from the asphericity and non-uniform density of\n\nthe central body as discussed under the \u201cGravitational Potential of a Distributed\n\nMass\u201d in Chap. 4.\n\n3.

The solar wind is a stream of\n\nelectrically charged gas that is propelled away from the sun in all directions at\n\nspeeds of almost 1 million miles per hour. Better understanding of the solar wind\n\nmay lead to more accurate prediction of damaging radiation waves before they\n\nreach satellites.

It is\n\na collaborative mission between NASA and the space agencies of Japan, the UK,\n\nNorway, and Europe and Japan\u2019s National Astronomical Observatory. Marshall\n\nmanages science operations andmanaged the development of the scientific instrumen-\n\ntation provided for the mission by NASA, industry and other federal agencies. The\n\nLockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center, Palo Alto, Calif., is the lead US\n\ninvestigator for the Solar Optical Telescope. The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observa-\n\ntory in Cambridge, Massachusetts is the lead US investigator for the X-Ray Telescope.\n\nTo view images about these findings and learn more about Hinode, visit:\n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/solar-b/.\n\nReference: Brown and Morone.\n\nDef.: Solar radiation pressure (SRP) is the force produced by the transfer of\n\nmomentum through impact, reflection, absorption, and re-emission of photons\n\nfrom the sun.\n\nThe earth is another perturbation source through reflected solar radiation and\n\nemitted radiation as shown in Fig. 5.1. At times, the moon looks bright in the area\n\nilluminated by the sun and dark, but not black, in the rest. The question is: where\n\ndoes the light come from that partially illuminates this dark region. It is not due to\n\nlight refraction by an atmosphere because the moon\u2019s atmosphere is extremely thin.\n\nThe answer is that the light comes from earthshine.\n\nRecall, from Chap. 1, the definition of a conservative force and the three\n\nequivalent properties for this definition. We say that a perturbing force Fp is\n\nconservative if it is derivable from a scalar function, i.e.,\n\nFp \u00bc ?U r\u00f0 \u00de\nRecall the gravitational potential U(r) of the earth considered in Sect. 4.4. The\nperturbing forces caused by third bodies are conservative field forces. There are\n\nalso non-conservative perturbing forces such as atmospheric drag.\n\nIn the case of geostationary orbits, solar pressure tends to change the eccentricity\n\n(shape) of the orbit. Atmospheric drag is pertinent to low-altitude orbits about the\n\nearth. Such forces tend to decrease the major axis (size) of the orbit, eventually\n\ncausing a satellite to fall back to the earth\u2019s surface.\n\nTwo categories of perturbation techniques, i.e., methods for solving the\n\nequations of motion with perturbations, are:\n\n1. Special perturbations, which use direct numerical integration of the equations of\n\nmotion, including all necessary perturbing accelerations.\n\nMoonSun\n\nFig. 5.1 Earthshine on\nthe Moon\n\n5.2 Perturbation Techniques 203\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/solar-b/\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_4#Sec17_4\n\n\n2. General perturbations, which use analytic integration of series expansions of the\n\nperturbing accelerations in the variational equations of orbit elements.\n\nSpecial Perturbations\n\nWe consider the following three methods for incorporating perturbations into our\n\nanalyses:\n\n1. Cowell\u2019s method integrates the sum of all accelerations numerically\n\nd2r\n\ndt2\n\u00fe ?\nr3\nr \u00bc ap \u00f05:1\u00de\n\nwhere ap\u00bc the sum of accelerations due to all disturbing forces. (Recall the\ndisturbed 2-body problem.)\n\nThe advantages of this method are:\n\n(a) Its simplicity.\n\n(b) It obtains the vectors r and v directly.\n\nHowever, it is not easy to see the resulting changes in classical orbit elements,\n\ni.e., changes caused by perturbations.\n\nRemark: Philip Herbert Cowell (1870\u20131949) used this method to predict the return\n\nof Halley\u2019s Comet in 1910.\n\n2. Encke\u2019s method integrates the differential accelerations instead of the total\n\naccelerations, omitting the gravitational acceleration of the central body.\n\nThe advantages of this method are:\n\n(a) It is quicker than Cowell\u2019s method.\n\n(b) It obtains the vectors r and v directly.\n\nHowever, it is not easy to see resulting changes in classical orbital elements.\n\nRemarks about Johann Franz Encke (1791\u20131865):\n\nHis education, though interrupted twice by military service during the Wars of\n\nLiberation, was guided by Gauss. His work on the computation of the orbit of a\n\ncomet with a period of 3.3 years brought him promotions and fame. The comet was\n\nlater called Encke\u2019s comet.\n\nRemark:\nEither of these methods works if formulated correctly. However, it is appropriate\n\nto use Cowell\u2019s method because of its simplicity and the speed of modern\n\ncomputers, which allows us to do so. Here, we work with the Cartesian state.\n\n3. Variation of Parameters considers the influence of perturbing forces on the\n\nKeplerian elements directly as we will see in the following discussion.\n\n204 5 Non-Keplerian Motion\n\n\n\nThe advantages for this method are as follows:\n\n(a) It provides analytic description of rates of change of Keplerian elements\u2014\n\nthus, we obtain direct information on how a particular force affects the\n\norbital elements.\n\n(b) It provides physical insight.\n\n(c) It becomes the starting point to develop averaging techniques.\n\nIts disadvantage is that it does not extract r and v directly in the process\n\n(However, it is possible to compute r(t) and v(t) from the Keplerian elements as\n\nin Sect. 4.3, Eqs.

The\n\nrates of change are given in terms of the components of the applied force in the\n\nRTW coordinate system. The differential equations for changes to the Keplerian\n\nelements are given by the Gaussian-Lagrange planetary equations, which can be\n\nfound in the reference by Pisacane and Moore, ed. In this reference, the components\n\nof force fR, fT, and fW are denoted as R, T, and W, respectively.\n\nAn elementary derivation of these perturbation equations is given in the refer-\n\nence by Burns. The method of proof in this reference is to write the orbital elements\n\nin terms of the orbital energyE and angular momentum h and then differentiate the\nresulting equations with respect to time to determine the effect on the orbital\n\nelements of small changes in E and h. The perturbation equations in terms of\ndisturbing force components are then derived by computing the manner in which\n\nperturbing forces change E and h.\n\n5.6 Primary Perturbations for Earth-Orbiting Spacecraft\n\nThe primary perturbations for earth-orbiting spacecraft are:\n\n(a) Gravitational forces of the sun and moon\n\n(b) Gravitational forces of the non-spherical earth\n\n(c) Atmospheric drag\n\n(d) Solar radiation pressure (SRP).\n\nThe perturbations (a) and (d) affect high altitude orbits the most, while (b) and\n\n(c) affect low orbits the most.

The total force, gravita-\n\ntional force plus f, obeys NII.\n\nFrom Table 5.2, an enlargement of the orbit (?a> 0) implies an average increase\nin PE\u00bc 2?E and average loss in KE\u00bc?E . A shrinking of the orbit (?a< 0)\nimplies an average decrease in PE\u00bc 2?E and an average gain in KE\u00bc?E . In\neach case, there is a net change in orbital energy ?E \u00bcwork done by an impulsive\nforce.\n\n5.7 Satellite Orbit Paradox 217\n\n\n\nApplications\n\nExample 1: Atmospheric Drag\nIn the presence of atmospheric drag, the disturbing force f is directly opposed to v,\n\nwhich produces ?E < 0 at all times. From Table 5.2, we see that a and ? decrease\nmonotonically and the average velocity increases. The drag is greatest at perigee\n\nwhere velocity and atmospheric density are greatest, which produces the greatest\n\nenergy drain at perigee and minimum at apoapsis. Therefore, the orbit becomes\n\nmore circular as it shrinks, so that the spacecraft spirals inward as shown in\n\nFig. 5.10 until it burns up or impacts the surface.\n\nExample 2: Libration of 24-Hour, Nearly Circular, Equatorial Satellite\nInitially, we modeled the earth as a point mass, then as a sphere, then as an oblate\n\nspheroid, and now as a triaxial ellipsoid. The last three models are shown in\n\nFig. 5.11. The equations of the last three models are:\n\nx2\n\na2\n\u00fe y\n\n2\n\na2\n\u00fe z\n\n2\n\na2\n\u00bc 1\n\nx2\n\na2\n\u00fe y\n\n2\n\na2\n\u00fe z\n\n2\n\nb2\n\u00bc 1\n\nx2\n\na2\n\u00fe y\n\n2\n\nb2\n\u00fe z\n\n2\n\nc2\n\u00bc 1\n\nfor a Cartesian coordinate system whose origin is at the center of mass of the earth.\n\nFigure 5.12 shows the earth\u2019s equator, which is an ellipse with the difference\n\nbetween major and minor axes approximately equal to 130 m with the long axis at\n\nFig. 5.10 Effect of\natmospheric drag on the\n\nspacecraft\u2019s orbit\n\nTable 5.2 Effect of disturbing impulse on orbit characteristics\n\nParameter For ?E >0 (positive thrust) For ?E < 0 (negative thrust)\na Increase Decrease\n\n(PE)av Increase Decrease\n\n(KE)av Decrease Increase\n\n?

The dashed curve in Fig. 5.12 shows the libration path of a\nspacecraft in a coordinate system that is rotating with the earth. The satellite is\n\nshown librating about a stable equilibrium point S. (Points marked \u201cU\u201d are unstable\n\nequilibrium points.) Consider the spacecraft at a point in its orbit to the right of the\n\npoint S and beyond the earth\u2019s orbit. The satellite is actually rotating about the earth\n\nin an orbit that is slightly further away from the earth than S. At this point, the\n\ngravitational tug of the mass bulge of the earth on the right-hand side is greater than\n\nthe force from the left-hand bulge, so the net force is a retarding force, which\n\nreduces a. The satellite moves to the right away from the earth because it is in a\n\nlarger orbit so it is moving slower than the earth. The satellite\u2019s orbit shrinks until it\n\nis inside the earth\u2019s orbit when it begins to speed up relative to the earth. The\n\nsatellite eventually overtakes the earth so that the equatorial bulge on the left has a\n\nEARTH\n\n?e\n\nFT\n\nFT\n\nUU\n\nFT\n\nFT\n\nS\n\nSFig. 5.12 Equatorial section\nof the Earth (looking south\n\nalong the polar axis)\n\na b c\n\na\na\n\na\ny\n\nx\n\nz\n\na\nb\n\na\ny\n\nx\n\nz\n\nbc\n\na\ny\n\nx\n\nz\n\nFig. 5.11 Earth models.

Eventually the spacecraft moves outside the earth\u2019s orbit and begins\n\nslowing down and moving to the right to repeat the libration.\n\nLibrations with periods of approximately 2.1 years have been observed on a\n\nSyncom satellite librating around the S point near 105?W longitude over Brazil.\n\nExample 3: Secular Acceleration of a Moon\n\nLet n\u00bc the secondary\u2019s orbital angular momentum and s\u00bc the primary\u2019s rota-\ntional angular momentum. For the earth\u2019s moon, s> n.\n\nThe force of the moon\u2019s gravity decreases with the inverse square of distance\n\naccording to Newton\u2019s Universal Law of Gravity. Therefore, the moon tugs on the\n\nwater closer to it more than on the earth so there is a high tide on the right-hand side\n\nas shown in Fig. 5.13. (The reader might wonder why there is a high tide on the\n\nother side of the earth. There is no force to the left pulling on the water. Since the\n\ngravitational force of the moon decreases with distance, the moon pulls the earth\n\naway from the water on the left side.)\n\nSince the bulge on the right is closer to the moon than the one on the left, there is a\n\nnet tangential force fT along the moon\u2019s velocity vector, providing ?E > 0 to the\nmoon\u2019s energy. From Table 5.2, we know that a and ? increase and the average linear\nand angular velocity decrease. Therefore, the moon is receding from the earth and the\n\nlength of the month is increasing. With no external torques acting on the earth\u2013moon\n\nsystem, the total angular momentum is a constant and as the moon\u2019s angular momen-\n\ntum increases the earth\u2019s spin momentum decreases due to friction on the ocean floor\n\n(which causes the high tide to be ahead of the direction to the moon as shown in\n\nFig. 5.13). Therefore, the day is getting longer. Eventually, the length of the daywould\n\nequal the length of themonth if tidal dragwere allowed to run its course. However, the\n\nsun will become a red giant long before that happens, engulfing the earth.\n\nIf s< n as for Phobos, a moon of Mars, and Triton, a satellite of Neptune, then the\nsituation is as shown in Fig. 5.14. Here the tidal forces withdraw energy and angular\n\nmomentum from the orbit of the moon so the orbit collapses and usually circularizes.\n\nReferences for Sect. 5.6: Blitzer; Burns; Murray and Dermott.\n\nMaterial from the reference by Leon Blitzer was reproduced with permission\n\nfrom the Am.

So there is gravity that is causing the spacecraft to\n\nfall, not zero G. Then he draws a cartoon of a young boy standing on a scale, which\n\nshows that his weight is 60 lb. The scale measures the force it must apply to prevent\n\nthe boy from falling to the floor. By NIII, that force is equal and opposite to the\n\ngravitational force of the boy, i.e., his weight. By NII, his gravitational force is\n\nF \u00bc ma \u00bc mg?\nwhere g? denotes the earth\u2019s gravity.\n\nThe author says to imagine that someone suddenly digs a hole under the boy that\n\ngoes straight down to the center of the earth. Then a cartoon shows that the scale,\n\nwhich the boy is still standing on as he falls, registers 0 lb. So the situation is not one\n\nof \u201czero G,\u201d as we often say, but one of \u201czero W,\u201d i.e., \u201czero weight.\u201d\n\nReference for Sect. 5.8: Branley.\n\nReferences for this chapter: Blitzer; Boain; Bond and Allman; Branley; Brown\n\nand Morone; Burns; Chao; Chobotov; Cutting, Born, and Frautnick; Kaplan;\n\nMurray and Dermott; NASA website; Pisacane and Moore; Sidi; Wertz and Larson.\n\nExercises\n\n5.1 A spacecraft is in a 24-h earth orbit when the Mission Design Team determines\n\nthat the period must be increased to 24.5 h.

For example, on March 27, 2008, the Jules Verne ATV\n\nconducted maneuvers \u201cto guide the ship to an \u2018interface point\u2019 24 miles behind\n\nand three miles below the station.\u201d Later, the ATV performed a rendezvous and\n\ndocking with the ISS.\n\nRendezvous in space between two satellites is accomplished when both satellites\n\nattain the same position vector and velocity vector at the same time. However, at the\n\ntime the rendezvous sequence is initiated, they may be very far apart, possibly with\n\none satellite at liftoff.\n\nThe two parts in a rendezvous sequence are:\n\n1.

Clohessy andWiltshire rediscovered these equations (in a paper in September\n\n1960) in a study of the motion of a vehicle relative to a satellite in earth orbit. These\n\ntwo applications are quite different, but they both consider small displacements\n\nrelative to a known reference motion. In Hill\u2019s application, the distance of the moon\n\nfrom the earth is small compared to the distance of the earth from the sun. In the\n\nClohessy\u2013Wiltshire application, the distance of the vehicle from the earth-orbiting\n\nsatellite is small compared to the distance from the satellite to the center of the\n\nearth. That is, ?<< r1.\n\n230 6 Spacecraft Rendezvous\n\n\n\nThese equations are called the Euler\u2013Hill1 equations in the reference by Pisacane\n\nand Moore.\n\nRemarks:\n\n1. These equations can be used to study:\n\n(a) The forces required to perform an orbit rendezvous.\n\n(b) The displacements from a reference trajectory produced by maneuvers or\n\nother velocity changes.\n\n(c) The effects of perturbations on the displacements from a reference\n\ntrajectory.\n\n2. These are second-order differential equations with constant coefficients. The\n\nsolution consists of:\n\n(a) The complementary solution (of the homogeneous equation, f\t 0), which is\nindependent of the accelerations and represents the effects of the initial\n\nconditions, and\n\n(b) A particular solution which represents the effects of the applied forces per\n\nunit mass.\n\n3.

After\n\n2 years he returned to West Nyack, NY where he worked from his home. Except for a period of\n\n10 years from 1882 to 1892 when he worked in Washington on the theory and tables for the orbits\n\nof Jupiter and Saturn, this was to be his working pattern for the rest of his life.\n\nE. W. Brown wrote:\n\nHe was essentially of the type of scholar and investigator who seems to feel no need of personal\n\ncontacts with others. While the few who knew him speak of the pleasure of his companionship in\n\nfrequent tramps over the country surrounding Washington, he was apparently quite happy alone,\n\nwhether at work or taking recreation.\n\nFrom 1898 until 1901, Hill lectured at Columbia University, but \u201ccharacteristically returned the\n\nsalary, writing that he did not need the money and that it bothered him to look after it.\u201d\n\n6.4 Terminal Rendezvous 231\n\n\n\nBy rearranging the first equation in Eq.

There is a secular drift term ? 6nx0 \u00fe 3y\u2022 0\u00f0 \u00det in the along-track y(t) that grows\nlinearly in time and can arise from either x0 or y\n\n\u2022\n\n0.\n\n3. The y-oscillation is a quarter period ahead of the x-oscillation with double the\n\namplitude.\n\n4. The third equation represents simple harmonic motion in the z direction,\n\ncorresponding to a slight inclination difference between target andchase orbits. Also\n\nz0 \u00bc 0 \u00bc z\u2022 0 \u00bc> z \t 0\n5. The oscillation in x represents a varying differential radius, ?r, which describes a\n\nneighboring elliptic orbit.\n\n6. The solution for y(t) has two parts:\n\n(a) A periodic component due to the oscillatory x-motion and\n\n(b) A term of the form k1t + k2. The term k1t is called secular and represents a\n\nsteady drift along the y-axis whose direction is determined by the sign of k1,\n\nwhich is determined by initial conditions x0 and y\n\u2022\n\n0. The drift due to a\n\nnonzero value of k1 describes a neighboring orbit of period slightly different\n\nfrom the target period. In the special case k1\u00bc 0, the periodic x and y motion\n\n232 6 Spacecraft Rendezvous\n\n\n\n(of the same period) represents a neighboring elliptic orbit with period equal\n\nto the target period.\n\n7. The combined effects of relative motion in all components of the CW frame\n\nrepresents the general case of a neighboring orbit that is elliptic, inclined, and of\n\ndifferent period than the target orbit.\n\nExample: Standoff Position to Avoid Collision with\nthe Target Vehicle\n\nIn Fig. 6.6, point A denotes the position of the chase spacecraft and B the position\n\nof the target vehicle, e.g., the ISS. The standoff position might be assumed prior\n\nto rendezvous to allow time, for example, for the astronauts to sleep, while\n\navoiding a collision between the two vehicles.

The equation for ?r(t) is the linear analog of\nKepler\u2019s equation because it gives the position ?r at time t in terms of the state at\nthe initial time t0\u00bc 0.\n\nRecall Lambert\u2019s Problem, the orbital boundary problem in the inverse-square\n\ngravitational field. The linear analog of Lambert\u2019s problem is given by the above\n\nequation for ?r(t) if ?r(t) and ?r(0) are specified and the unknown is the required\ninitial value ?v(0).

This section considers variations to the rendezvous\n\nsequence that are incorporated when we must consider such factors as the safety of\n\nthe astronauts and ways to enhance the delivery accuracy for accomplishing the\n\nrendezvous.\n\nSpace Shuttle Discovery\u2019s Rendezvous with the ISS\n\nOn the afternoon of 9/30/2009, a course correction burn moved Discovery to\n\n8 n. mi. behind the ISS. At this point, Discovery performed an 11-s Terminal\n\nInitiation (TI) burn, followed by 3\u20134 very small correction maneuvers. The Shuttle\n\nmoved to 725 ft below ISS along the position vector r, closing at 6 ft/s. (The\n\nannouncer on NASA TV called the position vector \u201crbar.\u201d) Commander Rick\n\nSturckow began flying Discovery manually, moving the spacecraft along rbar to\n\n650 ft below ISS, closing at 0.4 ft/s with pulsed firings. A rendezvous pitch\n\nmaneuver (RPM) implemented a \u201crotational back flip\u201d that took 8.5 min, turning\n\nat the rate of \u00be?/s. The objective was to enable two astronauts aboard ISS to take\npictures of Discovery\u2019s landing gear, external tank, and heat shield. Digital cameras\n\nwere used in this 90-s photo opportunity.\n\nManeuvers to move 400 ft ahead of ISS along its velocity vector and orient\n\nDiscovery for mating to the ISS achieved orientation within 1.25? pitch out. (Rick\nSturckow can easily correct pitch out in the final approach.) The shuttle proceeded\n\nto close in along the velocity vector at 0.2 ft/s and moved inch-by-inch within the\n\ncone of approach. The objective was to move the circular docking mechanism on\n\nsprings on Discovery to contact the pressurized docking mechanism on ISS for\n\nlink up.\n\nDiscovery braked to decrease the closing rate to 0.1 ft/s for contact and capture.\n\nThe reduced pitch out was made precisely aligned within 30 ft of ISS. The post-\n\ncontact thrust was armed 8 ft away from contact. Then there was contact and the\n\n6.5 Examples of Spacecraft Rendezvous 237\n\n\n\npost-contact thrust was performed so the two docking mechanisms were firmly set\n\nagainst one another. Capture occurred over the Atlantic Ocean. The two vehicles\n\nwere allowed to fly to allow damping and stabilization of relative motion between\n\nthe two vehicles. ISS pulled Discovery into firm contact by performing ring\n\nretraction to get a hard mate between the Shuttle and ISS. The two crews performed\n\nleak checks for 1\u00bd h. Then the hatches were opened for the crew greetings.\nWhile the shuttle remained in contact with ISS, NASA examined the pictures\n\nthat were taken during the final approach. The space agency began checking for\n\ndamage to the shuttle\u2019s delicate heat shield after the 2003 Columbia disaster. A slab\n\nof fuel tank foam knocked a hole in Columbia\u2019s wing, which led to its destruction\n\nduring re-entry. NASA\u2019s Mission Management Team said, \u201cThe Damage Assess-\n\nment Team provided their final summary to the team (NASA\u2019s Mission Manage-\n\nment Team) and declared that the TPS (thermal protection system) is acceptable for\n\nentry.\u201d\n\nReferences: William Harwood, \u201cSpace shuttle\u2019s heat shield cleared for entry,\u201d\n\nstory written for CBS News and appeared in Spaceflight Now.com; NASA TV.\n\nMars Sample Return\n\nA proposed future mission will return a sample from Mars, In such a mission, a\n\nlauncher will go to the surface of Mars, obtain a sample of Mars soil, rendezvous\n\nwith an orbiter, and pass the soil sample to the orbiter for return to the earth.\n\n6.6 General Results for Terminal Spacecraft Rendezvous\n\nParticular Solutions (f 6\u00bc 0)\n\nIn Sect. 6.4, we considered complementary solutions (f\u00bc 0) for the Hill\u2013Clohessy\u2013\nWiltshire equations Eq. (6.20). The particular solutions (f 6\u00bc 0) of these equations\nare dependent on the nature of the perturbing accelerations, the forcing function f.\n\nDecomposing the perturbations into constant and periodic functions, if possible,\n\nmay make the analysis more tractable.\n\nTarget Orbits with Non-Zero Eccentricity\n\nIn Sect. 6.4, we considered circular target orbits. The case of elliptical target orbits\n\nis considered in the reference by Jones. This reference gives formulas \u201cfor the\n\nperturbation state transition matrix of the two-body problem\u201d that \u201care valid for\n\nmotion in the linear neighborhood of reference orbits with 0? e< 1. . . . In addition\nto the general form, a simplified version, valid for small eccentricity orbits, is\n\ngiven.\u201d\n\n238 6 Spacecraft Rendezvous\n\n\n\nHighly Accurate Terminal Rendezvous\n\nAccuracy for terminal rendezvous is considered in the reference by\n\nKechichian 1992.\n\n\u201cA highly accurate analytic two-impulse terminal rendezvous theory is\n\npresented. A first-order orbit theory is combined with the second-order conic\n\napproximation in order to create a highly accurate predictor valid for several\n\nrevolutions. The resulting set of nonlinear equations of motion are solved via a\n\nNewton\u2013Raphson iteration process after providing the initial guess for the\n\ncomponents of the first velocity change from an analytic theory developed earlier.\n\nA computer code evaluates ?V1 with high accuracy resulting in negligible intercept\nor closure error at the specified final time.\u201d\n\nA typical large transfer where the two vehicles are initially separated by\n\n2,000 km is achieved with an interception error of 5 km.\n\nGeneral Algorithm\n\nAn algorithm for the two-impulse, time-fixed, noncoplanar rendezvous with drag\n\nand oblateness effects for the general elliptic orbit is given in the reference by\n\nKechichian 1998.\n\nReferences for this chapter: Bennett, Chobotov, Clohessy and Wiltshire, Fehse,\n\nHarwood, Hill, Jones, Kaplan, Kechichian 1992, Kechichian 1998, Prussing and\n\nConway, Pisacane and Moore, Vallado with contributions by Wayne D.

The DSN currently\n\nconsists of three deep-space communications facilities placed approximately 120?\n\napart in longitude around the world: at Goldstone, CA in California\u2019s Mojave\n\nDesert; near Madrid, Spain; and near Canberra, Australia. This strategic placement\n\npermits continuous observation of spacecraft as the earth rotates. Thus, a spacecraft\n\ncan have radio communication with one of the three DSN antennas, eventually\n\nmove out of the 2-way communication range of that antenna and into the range of\n\nanother antenna, and continuously repeat this process. To describe this process\n\nmore carefully, we introduce additional definitions for an observer that is an earth-\n\nbased (e.g., DSN) antenna. (For more information on the DSN, see the DSN\n\nWebsite at http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsn/.)\n\nDef.: An object is said to rise when it moves above the observer\u2019s local horizon.\n\nDef.: The transit of an object is its crossing of the observer\u2019s local meridian or\n\nlongitude, i.e., the point of highest possible elevation.\n\nThe word \u201ctransit\u201d means to \u201cgo across.\u201d One definition of the verb \u201ctransit\u201d in\n\nWebster\u2019s Dictionary is \u201cto pass across (a meridian, a celestial body, or the field of\n\nview of a telescope).\u201d So we also say that Venus made a transit of the sun on June\n\n8, 2004, meaning that the planet (a smaller body) passed across the disk of the sun\n\n(a larger body) at an angle visible from the earth, for the first time in 122 years.\n\nMercury made a transit of the sun on November 8, 2006 and makes approximately\n\n13 per century.\n\nDef.: An object is said to set when it moves below the observer\u2019s local horizon.\n\nSo the observer has radio communications from rise to set, minus any time of\n\ninterference from local terrain surrounding the antenna, called the \u201cmask.\u201d\n\nDef.: The solar elongation of an object is the sun\u2013earth\u2013object angle.\n\n244 7 Navigation and Mission Design Techniques and Tools\n\nhttp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/\nhttp://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsn/\n\n\nDef.: When an object has a solar elongation of 180?, the object is said to be at\nopposition and the disk of the object is as large as possible.\n\nThe planets Mars through Neptune can be in opposition with the earth, but\n\nMercury and Venus cannot.

Composed mostly of water ice with embedded dust particles,\n\ncomets originally formed in the cold outer planetary system while most of the rocky\n\nasteroids formed in the warmer inner solar system between the orbits of Mars and\n\nJupiter. The scientific interest in comets and asteroids is due largely to their status as\n\nthe relatively unchanged remnant debris from the solar system formation process\n\nsome 4.6 billion years ago. The giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune\n\nformed from an agglomeration of billions of comets and the left over bits and pieces\n\nfrom this formation process are the comets we see today. Likewise, today\u2019s\n\nasteroids are the bits and pieces left over from the initial agglomeration of the\n\ninner planets that include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. As the primitive,\n\nleftover building blocks of the solar system formation process, comets and asteroids\n\noffer clues to the chemical mixture from which the planets formed some 4.6 billion\n\nyears ago. If we wish to know the composition of the primordial mixture from\n\nwhich the planets formed, then we must determine the chemical constituents of the\n\nleftover debris from this formation process\u2014the comets and asteroids.\n\nExample: Visualize the Orbit of a Comet or Asteroid\nProcedure:\n\n1.

See Exercise 7.4.\n\nFor Exercise 7.4, use the partial derivative of each of the parameters with respect to\n\nVM at ?\u00bc 120?.\nThere may be other constraints on the implementation of the maneuver such as\n\nnot pointing optically\u2014or thermally\u2014sensitive instruments, e.g., a camera, at the\n\nsun or other bright body during the burn or during the turn to or from the burn\n\ndirection. It is also desirable to avoid loosing communication with the spacecraft\n\nduring the turns and burn, but this may be impossible to avoid. Some maneuvers are\n\nmade in the blind. Sometimes they are made behind the target body, i.e., behind\n\nwhen viewed from the earth. An example of performing a maneuver in the blind is\n\nthe orbit insertion burn for 2001 Mars Odyssey. (See Fig. 3.42.)\n\nControls\nThere are four controls, i.e., three components of the ?V and the time of ignition.\n\nTargets\nThere are less than or equal to four specified target parameters and not all targets are\n\nindependent, e.g., i and ?. However, tolerances on the parameters may allow\nsatisfying conditions on more than four parameters and on parameters that are not\n\nindependent of each other.\n\nManeuver Strategies\nA maneuver strategy is a sequence of interdependent maneuvers. Such a strategy\n\nmight be designed to overfly a specified site on the central body as, for example, for\n\nViking in orbit about Mars where the orbiters overflew the landers or to reduce the\n\n?V requirement to, for example, correct the rp by performing a maneuver at or near\napoapsis and the period by performing a maneuver at or near periapsis.\n\nReference: Hintz, Farless, and Adams\n\nAlgorithm for Computing Gradients in FPVS\n\nWe now define an algorithm for computing gradients in FPVS such as those given\n\nin Figs. 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, and 7.6 for use in PVO flight operations (Fig. 7.8).\n\nInput\nOrbit parameters: ?, rp,?,?, i with respect to a specified inertial coordinate system\n\n?min, ??, ?max\n\n?VGp,?VMp,?VNp \u00bc perturbations along V?

It also gives the mission analyst some basic back-\n\nground information about the moon, its orbit, and the previous missions that have\n\nexplored the moon. Table 7.1 provides some lunar, earth, and solar data for use in\n\nplanning our return to the moon.\n\nWe need the following lunar terminology.\n\nDef.: Apolune (aka apocynthion) is the point in a lunar orbit that is furthest from\n\nthe moon.\n\nDef.: A lunar orbit is an orbit about the moon.\n\nDef.: Perilune (aka periselene or pericynthion) is the point in a lunar orbit that is\n\nclosest to the moon.\n\nTable 7.1 Lunar and related data\n\nParameter Value Unit Remarks\n\nLunar data\n\nMean radius 1,737.5 km\n\nGmM 4,902.801 km\n3/s2\n\nAve. distance from earth 384,400 km\n\nSphere of Influence 56,462 km Approx. 9RL\nEarth data\n\nGmL 398,600.433 km3/s2\nMean equatorial radius RL 6,378.14 km\nSolar data\n\nGm? 132,712,440,017.987 km\n3/s2\n\nMean radius 6.96E + 05 km\n\n256 7 Navigation and Mission Design Techniques and Tools\n\n\n\nApollo Program\n\nWe begin this subsection with a brief discussion of selected Apollo lunar missions\n\nas an introduction to our quest to return to the moon. More information about all the\n\nApollo missions is available at the National Space Science Data Center Website at\n\nnssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov.\n\nThat website provides the following description of the program:\n\nThe Apollo program was designed to land humans on the Moon and bring them safely back\n\nto Earth. Six of the missions (Apollos 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17) achieved this goal. Apollos\n\n7 and 9 were Earth orbiting missions to test the Command and Lunar Modules, and did not\n\nreturn lunar data. Apollos 8 and 10 tested various components while orbiting the Moon, and\n\nreturned photography of the lunar surface. Apollo 13 did not land on the Moon due to a\n\nmalfunction, but also returned photographs. The six missions that landed on the Moon\n\nreturned a wealth of scientific data and almost 400 kg of lunar samples. Experiments\n\nincluded soil mechanics, meteoroids, seismic, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic fields,\n\nand solar wind experiments.\n\nThe website continues with the following explanation:\n\nThe Apollo mission consisted of a Command Module (CM) and a Lunar Module (LM). The\n\nCM and LM would separate after lunar orbit insertion. One crew member would stay in the\n\nCM, which would orbit the Moon, while the other two astronauts would take the LM down\n\nto the lunar surface. After exploring the surface, setting up experiments, taking pictures,\n\ncollecting rock samples, etc., the astronauts would return to the CM for the journey back to\n\nEarth.\n\nIn particular, Apollo 11 was launched on 7/16/1969, landed in the Sea of Tranquil-\n\nity on 7/20/1969, and returned to the earth safely on 7/24/1969. The commander of\n\nthe mission was Neil A. Armstrong, the lunar module \u201cEagle\u201d pilot was Edwin\n\nAldrin, Jr. (who later changed his name to Buzz Aldrin), and the command module\n\n\u201cColumbia\u201d was piloted by Michael Collins. Apollo 13 had a different adventure in\n\nwhich it was launched on 4/11/1970, performed a lunar flyby and return, but an\n\nexplosion onboard forced cancellation of the lunar landing, and then the astronauts\n\nreturned safely to earth on 4/17/1970. The commander of the Apollo 13 mission\n\nwas James A. Lovell, the lunar module \u201cAquarius\u201d pilot was Fred W. Haise, Jr, and\n\nthe command module \u201cOdyssey\u201d pilot was John L. Swigert, Jr.\n\nThe Apollo 13 failure was caused by the explosion of cryogenic oxygen tank\n\nNo. 2 55.9 h after launch. The LM had three propulsion systems: the Descent\n\nPropulsion System (DPS), the Ascent Propulsion System (APS), and the LM\n\nReaction Control System (RCS). All three propulsion systems used nitrogen tetrox-\n\nide and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine hypergolic propellants. The DPS was\n\nused for three maneuvers (DPS-1, DPS-2, and MCC-5, Midcourse Correction 5)\n\nafter the oxygen tank explosion. The APS was not used during the flight. The RCS\n\nprovided attitude control of the LM/CSM stack for most of the mission following\n\nthe explosion and performed the MCC-7 trajectory correction and SM separation\n\nmaneuvers. (\u201cCSM\u201d denotes the \u201cCommand and Service Module.\u201d)\n\n7.4 Free-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Analysis Techniques 257\n\nhttp://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov\n\n\nFor more information on the GNC challenges, see the reference by Goodman,\n\nwhich says:\n\nAfter a mission abort was declared, four trajectory adjustment maneuvers were performed.\n\nThe first placed the vehicle on a trajectory that would ensure return to Earth with appropri-\n\nate trajectory conditions at Entry Interface (EI), that is, the arrival of the vehicle at an\n\naltitude 400,000 ft above an oblate earth, a point at which the, vehicle enters the sensible\n\natmosphere. The second shortened the remaining flight time and moved the splashdown\n\npoint from the Indian Ocean to the mid Pacific, the normal landing area for Apollo lunar\n\nmissions. The third and fourth maneuvers were small trajectory adjustments to meet\n\nrequired EI conditions.\n\nReference: Goodman\n\nFree-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Analysis Method 1\n\nOur objective is to estimate circumlunar transfer parameters from a low-altitude\n\ncircular parking orbit about the earth.\n\nModeling Assumptions\nAt periapsis, the energy equation is\n\nvp\n2\n\n2\n? ??\n\nrp\n\u00bc ? ?\n\n2a\n\u00f07:4\u00de\n\nFor lunar transfer, take ra? rM, the moon\u2019s average radial distance from the earth.\nIgnoring the mass of the moon, we compute\n\n?v \u00bc vp ? vc \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2??\nrp\n\n? ??\na\n\ns\n?\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffi??\nrp\n\nr\n\u00f07:5\u00de\n\nfor a Hohmann transfer, where vp is obtained by solving Eq.

Shorter transfer times to the moon are possible by using\n\ntransfer orbits with apogee ra> rM, which requires extra ?v. However, the addi-\ntional impulse applied at perigee above that of a Hohmann transfer is small. So h is\n\nnot increased significantly above 7.2\n 104 km2/s for higher energy transfers.\nAlternately, we can consider the velocity vector at rM, i.e.,\n\nv \u00bc vrir \u00fe v?i?\nHigher energy transfers have vr> 0 at rM instead of vr\u00bc 0 as for a Hohmann\ntransfer.

The moon travels in a circular orbit about the earth that is approximately\n\n384,400 km in radius.\n\n2. Use of the patched conic model\u2014Since the moon is relatively close to the earth\n\nand the two bodies actually travel around each other, the results are less accurate\n\nthan those obtained for interplanetary transfer. The earth and moon move around\n\na common center of mass, which is 4,670 km away from the geocenter and, thus,\n\nthe position of the earth shifts considerably in the course of time. In fact, this\n\napproach is not satisfactory for calculation of earth return trajectories because of\n\nthe manner in which lunar gravity is handled. Also, the perilune altitude cannot\n\nbe accurately predicted. But the method is good for outbound?v evaluations and\nprovides insight into the problems of lunar transfer missions.\n\n3. In adopting the patched conics model, we assume Keplerian motion, ignoring\n\nthird body gravitational effects of, for example, the sun, and other perturbations,\n\nand modeling the earth and moon as perfect spheres.\n\n4. The sphere of influence of the moon is ignored until conditions at the lunar\n\ndistance have been established. (This zero sphere of influence model was also\n\nused in the interplanetary transfer analysis in the Venus flyby patched conics\n\nexample.) However, the lunar SoI is not negligibly small compared to the earth\u2013\n\nmoon distance. The radius of the SoI is about 15 % of the earth\u2013moon distance\n\n260 7 Navigation and Mission Design Techniques and Tools\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_2#Equ16_2\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_2#Equ26_2\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_2#Equ34_2\n\n\neven for the revised SoI discussed in Subsection 4.5. Therefore, the elliptic orbit\n\nis not a Hohmann trajectory to the moon.\n\n5. The gravitational attraction of the moon is ignored in computing the ?v for\ninjecting into the lunar transfer orbit.\n\n6. The calculations are made for rp\u00bc 6,600 km, which implies that the altitude of\nthe parking orbit\u00bc 222 km. Thus, we assume that parking orbits have altitudes\nof only a couple hundred km. Hence, we also have affi 1.96\n 105 km and,\ntherefore, ttransferffi 5.0 days.\n\n7. The transfer ?v is impulsive.\n8.

Assumption of a constant value for v?\u00bc 0.19 km/s at the moon\u2019s distance.\n\nTrajectory Design Tool: Michielsen Chart\nMichielsen devised a graphical display for all lunar transfer information, including\n\npassage effects, on a single plot. This chart is presented in Fig. 7.9 with an\n\napplication to the Apollo 11 Mission. The vr axis is calibrated in km/s, but is\n\ndirectly related to transfer time. Thus, each value of vr associated with the transfer\n\norbit corresponds to a unique value of transfer time. The two vertical lines marking\n\nthe constant values of v?\u00bc?0.19 km/s at rM are calibrated in days to reach rM, i.e.,\nthe transfer time from earth to the moon. Transfers which have v?\u00bc +0.19 km/s are\ndirect and those with v?\u00bc?0.19 km/s are retrograde.\n\nThe earth intercept zone connotes return to the earth without any thrusting\n\nmaneuvers.\n\nNote the moon\u2019s velocity vector vM.

So the point\n\nv?ffi 1 km/s, vrffi 0 is the orbital velocity of the moon with respect to the earth.\nA probe\u2019s approach (v?, vr) is specified by the transfer trajectory. Hyperbolic\n\npassage of the moon is handled in an analogous manner to that for planetary\n\npassage.\n\nAs the spacecraft reaches rM, the earth\u2019s gravitational attraction is \u201cturned off\u201d\n\n(in the model) and the moon\u2019s gravity is \u201cturned on\u201d (in the model). The deflection\n\nangle ? measures the turning of the spacecraft\u2019s velocity in the moon-relative hyper-\nbolic trajectory. A typical velocity vector diagram for lunar passage is shown in\n\nFig. 7.10. Since the spacecraft passes in front of the moon, the turn angle ? is taken\nclockwise and geocentric energy is decreased via a gravity assist (see Fig. 3.18). These\n\nvector triangles predict the probe\u2019s departure velocity v+ from the moon.\n\n7.4 Free-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Analysis Techniques 261\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_3#Fig18_3\n\n\nThe whole passage can be plotted on a Michielsen Chart.

Since the spacecraft\n\npassed in front of the moon, ? is taken clockwise such that the spacecraft returns\nto low earth perigee. Figure 7.11 depicts the flight profile in an earth\u2013moon fixed\n\ncoordinate system. Figure 7.12 is an enlargement of the flyby trajectory in moon-\n\nfixed coordinates.

This\n\nmethod provides good outbound ?v evaluations, but is not sufficiently accurate in\ncalculating earth return trajectories. So we do not proceed at this point to use r, v,\n\nand ? to evaluate the trajectory parameters of the return trajectory as we have done\nin Chap. 3. However, we do proceed to consider the circumlunar trajectories used\n\nfor the Apollo missions qualitatively.\n\nFree-Return Circumlunar Trajectories and Applications to the Apollo Missions\n\nDef.: A free-return circumlunar trajectory is a trajectory about the earth, which will\n\nfly by the moon and return to an earth reentry point without the assistance of any\n\npropulsive maneuvers after injection into the lunar transfer trajectory.\n\nA free return to the earth is accomplished via a lunar gravity assist.\n\nThis type of transfer was very useful on the Apollo lunar flights. If the spacecraft\n\nrockets could not be fired for any reason upon reaching the moon, safe return to the\n\nearth was guaranteed. Early Apollo flights were injected into free return trajectories\n\nof the type shown in Fig. 7.13. Typically, the spacecraft was sent on a 3-day\n\noutbound leg to make a front-side passage such that it could enter a 3-day return\n\nleg if a failure occurred. The corresponding simplified (from Fig. 7.9) velocity\n\nvector diagram is shown in Fig. 7.14. With the proper approach velocity, the\n\ntrajectory is deflected into a \u201cfigure 8\u201d pattern for free return to earth as shown in\n\nFigs. 7.13 and 7.17 (reconstructed plot for Apollo 13).\n\n264 7 Navigation and Mission Design Techniques and Tools\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_3#Equ27_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_3#Equ33_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_3\n\n\nDirect Versus Retrograde Trajectories\n\nRecall the definition of direct (or posigrade) orbits and retrograde orbits given in\n\nSect. 4.3:\n\nOrbits with 0? < i< 90? are direct (or posigrade)\nOrbits with 90? < i< 180? are retrograde\n\nas shown in Fig. 7.15.\n\nFigure 7.13 shows a trajectory with a direct outbound leg and direct return leg.\n\nFigure 7.16 shows a trajectory with a direct outbound leg and a retrograde return\n\nM\n\ndirect orbit\n(ccw)\n\nccw return\n\ndirect orbit\n(ccw)\n\nFig. 7.13 Apollo type free-\nreturn trajectory in earth\u2013\n\nmoon centered coordinates\n\nvq\n(km/s)\n\nvr (km/s)3.0   days\n\n+0.19km/s\n\n4.0   days\n\n5.0   days 0\n\nT\nra\n\nns\nfe\n\nr \nT\n\nim\ne \n\nto\nM\n\noo\nn \n\n(D\nay\n\ns)\n\nvM\nd = 87.7\u00b0\n\nv+\u00a5/M\n\nv+\n\nv_\n\nv-\u00a5/M\n\nFig. 7.14 Apollo mission\nfree-return vector diagram\n\n7.4 Free-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Analysis Techniques 265\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_4#Sec11_4\n\n\nleg. To change from a direct return leg to a retrograde return requires doing less\n\nbending in the hyperbolic trajectory at the moon. Recall, from Eq. (3.32), that large\n\nvalues of e imply little bending in the hyperbolic trajectory. From Eq. (3.27), we see\n\nthat the eccentricity of the hyperbolic trajectory can be increased by increasing rp or\n\nv1. Hence, the return leg can be changed from direct to retrograde by shortening\nthe time of flight on the outbound leg to increase v1 and/or raising the altitude at\nclosest approach at the moon. In Exercise 7.7, the reader will determine the value of\n\nthe turn (deflection) angle ? and the closest approach distance rp at the moon for an\nApollo type free-return trajectory.\n\nThe reconstructed figure in the reference by Walter shows that the Apollo\n\n11 free-return trajectory is symmetric and periodic and passes the surface of the\n\nmoon at a minimum distance of 111 km, which corresponds exactly to the\n\nperiselene (perilune) altitude of Apollo 8, 10, and 11. Later moon landing missions\n\nentered at this point into a circular moon orbit, from which it was possible to\n\ndescend to the moon\u2019s surface.

This indeed happened for Apollo 13. The reference by Adamo\n\nprovides an annotated geocentric plot, as shown in Fig. 7.17, of the reconstructed\n\nApollo 13 trajectory accompanied by the moon\u2019s geocentric motion.\n\nThese references also say that, while the reconstructed trajectories are fully\n\nsymmetric relative to the earth\u2013moon connecting line, the actual trajectories of\n\nthe Apollo missions were slightly asymmetric such that on return the spacecraft\n\nwould touch the earth\u2019s atmosphere in order to guarantee an automatic re-entry.\n\nThis asymmetry was achieved by a slight shift of the position of the periselene.\n\nDuring the outward as well as the return flight, the free-return trajectory is\n\nclearly elliptical in the proximity of the earth, as the gravitational influence of the\n\nearth is dominating. Approaching the edge of the moon\u2019s SoI, the trajectory\n\nbecomes more and more a straight line. Here the orbital velocity has already\n\ndecreased considerably and the gravitational influence of the earth and moon plus\n\ncentrifugal force just cancel each other. In this area, the real trajectory deviates\n\nutmost from the patched conics approximation. Near the moon, the trajectory is\n\nbent into a hyperbola.\n\nAs confidence in the Apollo CSM increased, the free-return trajectories were\n\nchanged to accommodate lunar orbit entry parameters. Apollo 13 had made a\n\nmidcourse correction to leave its free-return path before experiencing the failure,\n\nwhich aborted the lunar landing. The lunar module engines were used after the\n\nexplosion in the CSM to modify their course to enable return to the earth re-entry\n\naltitude in a reasonable time.\n\nFig. 7.17 Geocentric trajectory reconstruction plot for Apollo 13 [From \u201cApollo 13 Trajectory\nReconstruction via State Transition Matrices\u201d by Daniel R.

The main content of the following analysis is a complete parametric repre-\n\nsentation of the outward and return orbital inclinations and times of flight with the\n\npericynthion (periapsis of the lunar orbit) altitude at the moon and the position of\n\nthe moon (from ephemeris input) in its eccentric orbit. We will use the parametric\n\napproach to obtain approximate values for:\n\n(a) Injection conditions from the parking orbit about the earth into the outbound\n\nellipse\n\n(b) Approach conditions at the moon\u2014the pericynthion distance\n\n(c) Earth atmospheric entry and landing conditions.\n\nThese data could be used as first approximations in a precision trajectory search\n\nprogram, using linear search methods to solve for the corresponding exact trajec-\n\ntory. Thus, one could generate the nominal trajectory for a free-return circumlunar\n\nmission.\n\nSome examples of the comparison of data obtained in generating the parametric\n\nplots to results obtained by running an integration program with a high-precision\n\nmodel are presented in the following analyses to determine the validity of the\n\nparametric model. But the focus of this presentation is the simplified gravitational\n\nmodel of the earth\u2013moon system provided so that trajectories in this system can be\n\nstudied qualitatively and the parametric plots used in the qualitative studies with\n\nexamples of their use.\n\nThis study concentrates on the class of free-return circumlunar trajectories that\n\nare of interest to a crewed lunar program, i.e., injection from a circular parking\n\norbit, a very close approach to the surface of the moon, and re-entry into the earth\u2019s\n\natmosphere at a shallow angle. In addition, relationships are presented which tie the\n\ncharacteristics of such trajectories computed in an inertial coordinate system to the\n\ngeographic position of the launch and landing sites in earth-fixed (non-inertial)\n\ncoordinates.\n\n268 7 Navigation and Mission Design Techniques and Tools\n\n\n\nThe parametric plots considered here can be used for feasibility analyses,\n\nmission planning, and verification of results for lunar missions requiring free-\n\nreturn circumlunar trajectories.\n\nModel Assumptions (Simplifications) for Free-Return Circumlunar\nTrajectory Parametric Plots\nThe parametric plots are developed utilizing the following simplified model of\n\nmotion in the earth\u2013moon system. The model on which the following analysis is\n\nbased was first described by Egorov in 1956. (See reference by Egorov.)\n\nSphere of Influence\n\nThe simplified trajectory model is based on the sphere of influence concept where\n\nmotion outside of this sphere (centered at the moon) is represented by an earth-\n\ninfluenced conic and motion within the sphere is a moon-influenced conic. The\n\nconics are chosen such that the position and velocity vectors match at the spherical\n\nboundary as well as satisfying other constraints. For the parametric plots we will\n\nconsider, the sphere of influence is taken to be about 10 earth radii, 10R?. (Note the\nimproved model assumption versus the zero sphere of influence model considered\n\nfor the Patched Conic example.) Thus, we obtain two earth-based ellipses and one\n\nmoon-based hyperbola as shown in Fig. 7.18. These conics are such that the\n\nposition and velocity vectors match at the earth-to-moon and moon-to-earth\n\nphase boundaries. The apparent discontinuity in the velocity in Fig. 7.18 is due to\n\nthe moon\u2019s motion about the earth. This discontinuity is removed in the display by\n\nconsidering a rotating coordinate system fixed to the earth\u2013moon system as we have\n\ndone previously. Thus, we obtain a \u201cfigure-8\u201d trajectory.\n\nMoon\u2019s Orbit\n\nThe complex motion of the moon about the earth affects the behavior of circumlu-\n\nnar trajectories. Not only the moon\u2019s distance from the earth, which varies as\n\n56 R? < LD < 64R?,\n\nbut also the path angle of its velocity vector greatly affects important parameters\n\nsuch as pericynthion distance, time of flight, etc. Therefore, this study has to include\n\nas a variable parameter the moon\u2019s distance together with some indication of the\n\nradial direction of the moon\u2019s motion in terms of the inclination iM with respect to\nthe earth\u2019s equatorial plane.\n\nA first approximation to the moon\u2019s orbit would be an ellipse with a mean\n\nsemimajor axis and eccentricity of\n\naM \u00bc 60R? \u00bc 382, 688km and eM \u00bc 0:056\nrespectively. The inclination of the moon\u2019s orbit plane with respect to the earth\u2019s\n\nequatorial plane varies as\n\n7.4 Free-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Analysis Techniques 269\n\n\n\n18:5? ? iM ? 28:5?\n\nand the node regresses with both conditions having a period of approximately\n\n20 years. (In 1967, the inclination was near its maximum.) Further, the line of\n\napsides advances at a rate of approximately 40? per year. All dependence on these\nangular variations is avoided if the circumlunar trajectories are referred to the\n\nmoon\u2019s orbit plane. However, the mean ellipse is a poor approximation of the\n\nmoon\u2019s in-plane motion. The moon\u2019s perigee varies by about 2.5 R? and its apogee\nvaries about 0.5R? as seen in the reference by Woolston. A cycle of this variation\noccurs in approximately 7 months.\n\nBecause of the large variation in the perigee, we will include trajectories for both\n\nextremes of this distance. Since the apogee variation is small, we assume it to be\n\nMOON\nPHASE EARTH PHASE\n\num\n\nv\n\nv\n\nOUTWARD LEG\n\nEARTH\n\nINJECTION\n\nLANDING POINT\n\nLAUNCH\n\nRE-ENTRY\n\nRETURN LEG\n\nSPHERE OF INFLUENCE\nAT ENTRY\n\nSPHERE OF INFLUENCE\nAT EXIT\n\nM\n\nM\n\nu\n\nu\num\n\nFig. 7.18 Schematic of a circumlunar free-return trajectory\n\n270 7 Navigation and Mission Design Techniques and Tools\n\n\n\nconstant.

The distance from these points to the earth and the values of the semimajor\n\naxis for the conics through points A and A0 are given in Table 7.2.\n\nFixed Conditions\n\nThe following conditions are known:\n\n1. Cape Canaveral, which is at 28.5?N latitude and 80.6?W longitude, has been\nchosen as the launch site.\n\n2. The moon\u2019s orbital inclination has been chosen near its maximum value of\n\n28.5?, reflecting the value at the time of the early Apollo launches. This\nassumption permits launches from the Cape into the moon\u2019s orbit plane.\n\nB\n\nD\n\nA\nPERIGEE\n\nA?C\nAPOGEE\n\nFig. 7.19 Positions of the moon in its orbit about the earth\n\nTable 7.2 Distance of the\nmoon from the earth\n\nLocation Distance (km)\n\nPerigee A0 356,620\nPerigee A 368,812\n\nPosition B 390,149\n\nPosition C (Apogee) 405,389\n\nPosition D 381,005\n\nAverage LD 384,400\n\na for Perigee A0 381,005\na for Perigee A 387,100.50\n\n7.4 Free-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Analysis Techniques 271\n\n\n\n3. The powered flight angle and time were chosen as 30? and 10 min, respectively.\n4. The circular parking orbit altitude was fixed at 600,000 ft (183 km) and the\n\ninjection flight path angle at 90?.\n5. Reflecting the desired value for crewed flights, the re-entry angle was chosen as\n\n96? measured from the vertical (6? from horizontal) with a re-entry altitude of\n400,000 ft (122 km). This altitude is the \u201centry interface (EI)\u201d location.\n\nSpecifying the above launch and re-entry conditions is almost equivalent to\n\nfixing the perigee altitudes of the outward and return phases of the mission. The\n\nlaunch azimuth from the Cape determines the inclination of the outward phase and\n\nthe inclination of the return phase is a separate input.\n\nAdditional Assumptions Used Selectively\n\nSeven categories of parametric plots, listed as Categories (1)\u2013(7), are considered\n\nbelow in the subsection entitled \u201cPenzo Parametric Plots for Circumlunar Free-\n\nReturn Trajectory Analyses.\u201d For the first three categories, no additional\n\nsimplifying assumptions were made. However, additional assumptions had to be\n\nmade to eliminate second order effects. For example, for the next three categories, it\n\nis assumed that the declination and right ascension of the spacecraft\u2019s entry and exit\n\npoints at the SoI are equal to those of the moon at the time of the spacecraft\u2019s\n\npericynthion passage. This assumption allows the generation of first order graphical\n\ndata, which could not be done otherwise.\n\nFree-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Selection Procedure\nSince only conic motion is considered in the model, it is possible to program the\n\nequations to satisfy certain initial and terminal conditions. Utilizing an iterative\n\nscheme, it is possible to solve the boundary value problem.\n\nThe input quantities for this selection procedure are:\n\n1. Day of launch\n\n2. Launch azimuth\n\n3. Powered flight angle from launch to burnout\n\n4. Flight path angle at injection\n\n5. Parking orbit altitude\n\n6. Length of coast in the parking orbit\n\n7. Time of flight to the moon\n\n8. Clockwise or counterclockwise return trajectory to the earth\n\n9. Re-entry flight path angle\n\n10. Re-entry altitude\n\n11. Re-entry maneuver downrange angle\n\n12. Maneuver time to touchdown\n\n13. Latitude of the landing site\n\n14. Longitude of the landing site\n\n272 7 Navigation and Mission Design Techniques and Tools\n\n\n\nThe first seven quantities are required to determine the outward leg of the earth-\n\nphase trajectory. Thus, we calculate the time of launch, time (duration) of coast to\n\nthe injection point in the parking orbit, conic elements, and the position, velocity\n\nand time of any point on the outward leg. The first aim point for this leg is the center\n\nof a massless moon. The successive aim points, calculated from the second iteration\n\non, will be the entry point at the moon\u2019s sphere of influence with the mass of the\n\nmoon considered.\n\nThe next six parameters, together with the moon-phase exit velocity magnitude\n\nfrom the sphere of influence (which equals the moon-phase entry velocity magni-\n\ntude), are used to determine the earth-phase return leg of the trajectory. The solution\n\nof this phase requires an iterative procedure as shown in Fig. 7.20. The iterative\n\nprocedure is needed to solve for the direction of the moon-phase exit velocity\n\nvector, which is unknown, so that the earth-phase energy is unknown. A first guess,\n\nsuch as assuming that the energy is equal to that of the outward leg, is made and\n\nsuccessive iterations performed until the calculated earth-phase velocity at the exit\n\npoint is consistent with the required moon-phase velocity. This iterative procedure\n\nproduces a unique circumlunar trajectory.\n\nAfter calculating the return phase conic, the exit velocity vector can be calcu-\n\nlated. This velocity vector is found with respect to the moon by subtracting off the\n\nvelocity vector uM of the moon with respect to the earth at the time of exit as\n\nindicated in Fig. 7.18. An ephemeris file provides the exact position and velocity of\n\nthe moon at any time.\n\nThe two moon-centered velocity vectors at entrance and exit of the sphere of\n\ninfluence (SoI) completely determine the moon-phase conic (see Exercise 7.11);\n\nthe plane being determined by the cross-product of the two velocity vectors; and\n\nthe conic (hyperbolic) elements, a and e. From the conic elements, the entry and\n\nexit positions at the sphere can be found. At this point, the calculated positions are\n\ncompared with those found from the earth-phase conics. If they lie within\n\nspecified tolerances, then the search is complete. If not, the old positions and\n\ntimes at the sphere are replaced by the new values just calculated and the process\n\nis repeated.\n\nSo far, we have not used the landing site longitude, because the conic calculated\n\nfor the return phase is referenced to inertial space and is independent of any\n\ngeographic position on the earth. The return phase conic and the time of landing,\n\nwhich is an output parameter, determine the landing site longitude. To obtain a\n\ndesired longitude, the total time of circumlunar flight time must be altered, letting\n\nthe earth obtain the correct orientation with respect to the moon at re-entry to obtain\n\nthe desired landing longitude. The total time of flight is altered by changing the\n\ninput time of flight to the moon in the launch phase. Once this is done, the entire\n\ncircumlunar search process is repeated until the landing site longitude tolerance\n\nis met.\n\n7.4 Free-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Analysis Techniques 273\n\n\n\nTrajectory Design Tool: Penzo Parametric Plots for Circumlunar Free-Return\nTrajectory Analyses\nThis subsection provides the Penzo parametric (P2) plots, which display data with\n\nrespect to the pericynthion distance, flight time, launch azimuth, and landing site\n\nlocation.

Some Additional Parameters\n\nAll of these plots were obtained from the reference:\n\nPaul A. Penzo, \u201cAn Analysis of Free-Flight Circumlunar Trajectories,\u201d STL\n\nReport No. 8976-6010-RU-000, Space Technology Laboratories, Inc., Redondo\n\nBeach, CA, 1962.\n\nThis report was generated for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nCategory (1): Pericynthion Distance\n\nFigures 7.21, 7.22, 7.23, 7.24, 7.25, 7.26, 7.27, 7.28, 7.29, and 7.30 show the\n\nvariation of the pericynthion distance with the inclination of the return phase\n\nconic for fixed times of flight To (in hours) to the moon. Also plotted on each\n\ngraph are two curves for fixed return times Tr (in hours) from the moon.\n\nSpecifically, Figs. 7.21, 7.22, 7.23, 7.24, and 7.25 consider launches in the\n\nmoon\u2019s orbit plane.\n\nExample (Apollo): Launches in the moon\u2019s orbit plane were possible for the\n\nearly Apollo missions because the moon\u2019s inclination with respect to the earth\u2019s\n\nequatorial plane was 28.5?, which equals the latitude of the launch site.\nThe first noticeable characteristic of these curves is that, for fixed outward flight\n\ntimes, the pericynthion altitude is greater for clockwise (cw) returns than for\n\ncounterclockwise (ccw) returns. (See Fig. 7.13, which shows a direct outbound\n\ntrajectory with a direct return, and Fig. 7.16, which shows a direct outbound\n\ntrajectory with a retrograde return.) A similar characteristic is the fact that, for\n\nfixed return flight times, the pericynthion altitudes are greater for ccw return\n\ntrajectories than for cw return trajectories.\n\nRecall, from Eqs. (3.27) and (3.33), large e implies little bending so rp small\n\nimplies large bending as needed to achieve ccw return leg. Therefore, to change\n\nfrom a posigrade to a retrograde return leg, we must shorten TFL outward and/or\n\nraise periapsis at the moon.\n\nExamples in Fig. 7.21:\n\nio\u00bc 0?, ir\u00bc 70?

Free-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Analysis Techniques 285\n\n\n\nWe turn now to the effect of the moon\u2019s distance on the pericynthion altitude for\n\na fixed flight time to the moon and fixed outward and return inclinations. Since the\n\nV1 at the moon must increase with increasing lunar distance, the pericynthion\naltitude must decrease to maintain the some bending of the hyperbolic trajectory for\n\nthe spacecraft\u2019s return to this earth (see Eqs. 3.27 and 3.33). Similarly, this result\n\nalso holds true for a fixed return flight time.\n\nExample of moon\u2019s distance on pericynthion altitude for a fixed flight time to the\n\nmoon and fixed outward and return inclinations:\n\nio\u00bc 0?, ir\u00bc 60?, and To\u00bc 68 h\n\nFigure 7.22 (Position A)) pericynthion altitude\u00bc 620 nm\u00bc 1148 km\nFigure 7.23 (Position B)) pericynthion altitude\u00bc 284 nm\u00bc 526 km\nA final characteristic of these curves is the symmetry condition. As mentioned\n\nabove, circumlunar trajectories are symmetric with respect to the moon\u2019s phase.\n\nFigures 7.21, 7.22, 7.23, 7.24, and 7.25 for which the outward phase lies in the\n\nmoon\u2019s plane, i.e., the outward phase inclination is io\u00bc 0?, indicate this result since\nvalues for return phase inclinations ir are equal to ?ir values.\n\nExamples in Fig. 7.21:\n\nio\u00bc 0?, ir\u00bc 60? and To\u00bc 62 h\n) pericynthion altitude\u00bc 300 nm\u00bc 556 km\n\nio\u00bc 0?, ir\u00bc?60? and To\u00bc 62 h\n) pericynthion altitude\u00bc 300 nm\u00bc 556 km\n\nFigures 7.26, 7.27, 7.28, 7.29, and 7.30 are for launches normal to and below the\n\nmoon\u2019s orbit plane, i.e., the outward phase inclination is io\u00bc?90?. A comparison\nof pericynthion altitude for return inclinations ir with inclinations ?ir (where ir is\npositive) indicates that negative return inclinations result in lower pericynthion\n\ndistances for a given outward phase flight time. This fact can be explained by means\n\nof the general observation that the angle through which the moon phase velocity\n\nvector must turn at entrance and exit of the moon\u2019s sphere of influence is greater for\n\noutward and return earth phases on the same side of the moon\u2019s orbit plane\n\n(ir\u00bc?90? < 0 and ir< 0) than for these phases on opposite sides of the moon\u2019s\norbit plane (ir\u00bc?90? < 0 and ir> 0). Thus, for a fixed outward time of flight, which\nimplies an essentially fixed moon phase velocity magnitude, the pericynthion\n\ndistance must be less to achieve the required greater turning of the velocity vector\n\nfor (in this case) negative return phase inclinations from Eqs. (3.27) and (3.33).\n\nExamples in Fig. 7.26 (io):\n\nio\u00bc?90?, ir\u00bc 60? and To\u00bc 66 h\n) pericynthion altitude\u00bc 224 nm\u00bc 415 km\n\nio\u00bc?90?, ir\u00bc?60? and To\u00bc 66 h\n) pericynthion altitude\u00bc 150 nm\u00bc 278 km\n\n286 7 Navigation and Mission Design Techniques and Tools\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_7#Equ27\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_7#Equ33\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_3#Equ27\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-09444-1_3#Equ33\n\n\nCategory (2): Time of Flight\n\nThe times of flight considered here are the times from injection to pericynthion,\n\nfrom pericynthion to re-entry, and the sum of these values, i.e., the total time of\n\nflight. For the fixed conditions listed above, specifying the outward and return\n\ninclinations and the outward time of flight determine a unique trajectory and, in\n\nparticular, a specific return time of flight. Figures 7.31, 7.32, 7.33, 7.34, 7.35, 7.36,\n\n7.37, 7.38, 7.39, and 7.40 present this return time versus the outward time for\n\nconstant return phase inclinations with the moon\u2019s orbit plane. Each graph is drawn\n\nfor an in-plane or normal firing with respect to the moon\u2019s orbit plane and for a\n\nparticular position of the moon in its orbit. Constant total flight times are also\n\nplotted as indicated by the labels shown in the right-hand side of each figure.\n\nIn comparing these graphs, several observations can be made. The first observa-\n\ntion is that launches in the moon\u2019s orbit plane produce equal or greater flight times in\n\nthe return phase. Return flight times for launches normal to themoon\u2019s orbit plane are\n\nnearly symmetric with respect to 90? returns. Secondly, the difference in the outward\nand return times of flight may be considerable, as youwill demonstrate in an exercise.\n\nAs indicated on all the time graphs, the dashed curves represent extrapolated\n\nvalues, i.e., values not obtainable with the simplified model in the parametric plots.\n\nThere is no guarantee that these extrapolated trajectories exist and, in fact, some do\n\nnot exist. In particular, there is a constraint cut off in the upper region of the cw\n\nreturn trajectories. These extrapolated values are verified in the next step of the\n\ntrajectory design procedure, which is to run precision software after selecting the\n\nbest opportunity available in the parametric plots.\n\nExamples in Fig. 7.31 (Minimum Perigee Position A0):\n\nOutward FT\u00bc 70 h and return ir\u00bc 0?\n) Return FT\u00bc 72 h\u00bc 3 days\n\nOutward FT\u00bc 65 h and return ir\u00bc 30?\n) Return FT\u00bc 68.5 h\n\nCategory (3): Fixed Pericynthion Altitude\n\nConsider free-return circumlunar trajectories that approach very close to the moon.\n\nThis class of trajectories can be generated by cross-plotting Figs. 7.21, 7.22, 7.23,\n\n7.24, 7.25, 7.26, 7.27, 7.28, 7.29, and 7.30. This cross-plotting was done for an\n\naltitude of 100 nautical miles to produce Figs. 7.41, 7.42, and 7.43. One may choose\n\nspecific outward and return inclinations and then obtain a specific pericynthion\n\ndistance by controlling the outward time of flight. This time of flight depends on the\n\nmoon\u2019s distance from the earth as indicated in Fig. 7.41 (for launches in the moon\u2019s\n\norbit plane) and Fig. 7.42 (for launches orthogonal to the moon\u2019s orbit plane) when\n\nthe moon is at positions A, B, C, or D. The required outward time of flight decreases\n\nas the return inclinations go from 0? (ccw) to 180? (cw). However, the return time of\nflight increases. Recall that the pericynthion altitude is greater for cw returns than\n\nfor ccw returns. Therefore, to decrease the pericynthion altitude for cw returns,\n\nholding the turning angle of the moon phase velocity nearly fixed, one must\n\n7.4 Free-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Analysis Techniques 287\n\n\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n60\n\n18\n0\n\n15\n0\n\n12\n0\n\n90\n\n60\n\n30\n0\n\n70\n\nDISTANCE OF THE MOON = 1.179 FEET (PERIGEE)\nLAUNCHED IN THE MOON\u2019S ORBIT PLANE\n\nEXTRAPOLATED VALUES\n\nTOTAL FLIGHT TIME TT (HOURS)\n\nFLIGHT TIME ?

A similar argument can be used to explain the increase in the return\n\nflight time when going from ccw to cw returns. These variations in flight time are\n\ncommon to both Figs. 7.41 and 7.42 regardless of whether the spacecraft is\n\nlaunched in the moon\u2019s orbit plane or perpendicular to the moon\u2019s orbit plane.\n\nFigure 7.43 gives the total time of flight, which is strongly affected by the distance\n\nto the moon with variations over 20 km, but nearly constant otherwise.\n\nCategory (4): Azimuth and Inclination\n\nGiven that a specific circumlunar trajectory is to be generated, what launch azimuth\n\nfrom the Cape and what return inclination with respect to (wrt) the earth\u2019s equato-\n\nrial plane are required? This situation would be for specific outward and return\n\ninclinations wrt the moon\u2019s orbit plane. First, it is clear that the launch azimuth,\n\ntogether with the declination of the Cape, will determine the outward phase\n\ninclination wrt the earth\u2019s equator. This relationship is shown in Fig. 7.46. The\n\ninclination iMo of this outward trajectory plane wrt the plane of the moon\u2019s orbit\nwill in turn depend on the inclination io wrt the equatorial plane, the inclination iM\nof the moon\u2019s orbit plane, and the declination ?M of the moon, as shown in\nFig. 7.44. Figures 7.47, 7.48, 7.49, 7.50, and 7.51 indicate the relationships between\n\nthese parameters for several inclinations of the moon\u2019s orbit plane. These figures,\n\ntogether with Fig. 7.46, determine the launch azimuth from the Cape for a desired\n\ntrajectory plane\u2019s inclination wrt the moon\u2019s orbit plane.

Since the complete trajectory\n\nfrom launch to arrival at the moon may produce an in-plane angle greater than 360?,\nMercator projections such as Fig. 7.45 are very convenient. Figure 7.45 presents the\n\nthree types of coasting orbits that we may encounter:\n\nType (1) is defined as the coasting orbit required to intercept the moon on the\n\nspacecraft trajectory\u2019s first downward swing.\n\nType (2) is the coast trajectory that will intercept the moon on the trajectory\u2019s next\n\nupward swing. This coast is the section labeled (2) in Fig. 7.45.\n\nType (3) is the coast trajectory that will intercept the moon on its next downward\n\nswing after the type (2) section.\n\nIt is possible that a Type (1) or (2) trajectory will not exist for a particular set of\n\ncircumstances; however, a Type (3) will always exist. In all cases, the outward\n\nphase conic will consist of a launch powered flight arc, a coasting arc in the parking\n\norbit, and a free-flight (post injection) arc.\n\nThe inclination of the return phase conic as a required input in the trajectory\n\nselection procedure must be referenced to the earth\u2019s equatorial plane. This input\n\nvalue may vary from ?90? to 90?. The inclination is plus if the vehicle leaves the\nsphere of influence upward wrt the equatorial plane and negative otherwise.\n\nFig. 7.46 provides the launch azimuth from Cape Canaveral versus the outward\n\nphase inclination and, for the return phase, Figs. 7.47\u20137.51 present a direct rela-\n\ntionship between the inclination wrt the moon\u2019s orbit plane and the inclination wrt\n\nthe equatorial plane. For example, Figs. 7.46 and 7.51 show that, when the inclina-\n\ntion iM of the moon is 28\n?, it is possible to launch into the moon\u2019s orbit plane,\n\nusing a 90?-launch azimuth from the Cape.\nIn the Mercator projection in Fig. 7.52, the trajectory follows a plane that is\n\nthrough the center of the earth; however, zero inclination wrt the moon is attained\n\nonly if the trajectory motion of the spacecraft corresponds with the motion of the\n\nmoon. This figure indicates that this correspondence occurs on the day when the\n\nmoon is passing through its descending node. A Type (3) coast trajectory is\n\nnecessary in the case considered in Fig. 7.52 because Type (1) is too short and\n\nType (2) crosses the moon\u2019s plane with about a 57? inclination.\nThe next section relates the inclination to the re-entry (maneuver) angle.\n\nTYPE 3\n\n~28.5\u00b0 ~28.5\u00b0\n\n90\u00b0\n\nCape\n\nFirst downward\nswing of S/C Second downward\n\nswing of S/C\n\nDescending node\nof the moon\n\nL\nat\n\nit\nud\n\ne \nvs\n\n. \nlo\n\nng\nit\nud\n\ne \nof\n\nS/\nC\n\n f\nro\n\nm\n e\n\nar\nth\n\n\u2019s\n e\n\nqu\nat\n\nor\nFirst upward\nswing of S/C\n\nMoon\u2019s plane\n\nDescending node\nof the moon\n\nAscending node\nof the moon\n\nFig. 7.52 Trajectory characteristics for launching in the moon\u2019s orbit plane\n\n7.4 Free-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Analysis Techniques 309\n\n\n\nCategory (5): Maneuver Angle and Touchdown Latitude\n\nRe-entry is described in terms of the maneuver angle or re-entry angle ?r, which is\ndefined as follows.\n\nDef.: The maneuver angle or re-entry angle ?r is the great circle arc required by the\nspacecraft in going from the re-entry point, at about 400,000 ft (122 km) altitude, to\n\na specified landing site.\n\nThe maneuver angle is the downrange angle in the orbit plane from where the\n\nspacecraft entered the atmosphere to landing. It is assumed that, during this \u201cmaneu-\n\nver,\u201d the spacecraft remains in the same plane as the return phase conic. The magni-\n\ntude of this angle for crewed re-entry presently varies between 20? and 60?.\nFigure 7.53 is a Mercator projection of a possible return phase conic and maneuver\n\nangle, where ?i is the desired latitude of the touchdown (TD) point. The declination of\nthe spacecraft\u2019s exit point from the sphere of influence is approximately that of the\n\nmoon when the vehicle is at pericynthion. (Examination of many runs indicates that\n\nthe two declinations will be within 1.5? of each other.) Also, the in-plane angle ?sr\nmeasured from the sphere of influence S (or essentially themoon) to the re-entry point\n\nR depends essentially on the time of the return flight from pericynthion passage to re-\n\nentry and the re-entry (velocity) flight path angle ?r. For a re-entry angle of 96?, an\nexamination of trajectory computer runs indicates that this angle ?sr will be within 5?\nof 160? regardless of the time of flight and the distance of themoon. Figure 7.53 shows\nthat the maneuver angle is a function only of the declination ?M of the moon at the\nvehicle\u2019s pericynthion, the inclination ir of the return phase conic, and the touchdown\n\nlatitude F. The relations between these quantities are given in Figs. 7.54, 7.55, and 7.56\n\nfor three fixed values of the re-entry maneuver angle. It is interesting to note the\n\nlimitations on the available touchdown latitudes for a maneuver angle of 20?. This\nlimitation is caused by the fact that the total in-plane angle from the moon to\n\ntouchdown adds up to 180?. Thus, for a given declination of the moon, the only\navailable touchdown latitude is the negative of this declination, regardless of the\n\nreturn inclination. A maneuver angle of 40? will result in a total in-plane angle\nof 160? \u00fe 40? \u00bc 200?. Thus, returning above the equator will cause the spacecraft to\nreach touchdown latitudes lower than the negative of the declination of the moon and\n\nreturning below the equator will result in touchdown latitudes below that of the\n\nnegative of the declination of the moon. This effect is even more pronounced in\n\nFig. 7.56 where the maneuver angle is 60?. If maneuver angles greater than 60? are\nallowed, even greater ranges of touchdown latitudes will be produced.\n\nEQUATOR\n\nhsr\n\nhr\n\nF\n\nR\nS\n\n?i\n\n??M ir\n\nFig. 7.53 Relation of the re-entry maneuver angle to the return phase geometry\n\n310 7 Navigation and Mission Design Techniques and Tools\n\n\n\n0\n20\n\n30\n10\n\n40\n50\n\n60\n70\n\n80\n90\n\nR\nE\n\nT\nU\n\nR\nN\n\n P\nH\n\nA\nS\n\nE\n IN\n\nC\nLI\n\nN\nA\n\nT\nIO\n\nN\n M\n\nE\nA\n\nS\nU\n\nR\nE\n\nD\n F\n\nR\nO\n\nM\n T\n\nH\nE\n\n E\nQ\n\nU\nA\n\nT\nO\n\nR\nIA\n\nL \nP\n\nLA\nN\n\nE\n (\n\nD\nE\n\nG\nR\n\nE\nE\n\nS\n)\n\n?6\n0\n\n?7\n0\n\n?8\n0\n\n?9\n0\n\n?7\n0\n\n?6\n0\n\n?5\n0\n\n?4\n0\n\n?3\n0\n\n?2\n0\n\n?2\n0\n\n?

Data from Exercise 7.16.\n\nWith the figures given here and those of the last section, it is possible to relate the\n\nre-entry maneuver angle and the latitude of the landing site to the inclination of the\n\nreturn phase wrt the moon\u2019s orbit plane. Thus, if one begins with a day of launch\n\n(a particular inclination and declination of the moon) and the spacecraft\u2019s inclina-\n\ntion wrt the moon\u2019s orbit plane, as well as the touchdown latitude, then the re-entry\n\nmaneuver angle and the inclination wrt the equatorial plane can be found. Also, it is\n\ninteresting to note that fixing the spacecraft\u2019s inclination, re-entry angle and\n\ntouchdown latitude determine a specific declination of the moon, which in turn\n\nwill require a specific day of launch.\n\nCategory (6): Touchdown Longitude\n\nReturning to the Free-Return Circumlunar Trajectory Selection Procedure, note that\n\nwe have not included targeting to the longitude of the landing site. However, we did\n\nsay earlier that the correct longitude is acquired by adjusting the input time of flight\n\nto the moon in the launch phase. Adjusting the outward flight time allows the earth\n\nto attain the desired orientation wrt the moon at the time of spacecraft re-entry.\n\nFigure 7.57 indicates the dependence of longitude on other parameters. The entry\n\nand exit points of the sphere of influence are within 3? of each other in right\nascension and about 1.5? of each other in declination. This small difference in\nlocation implies that, as far as the earth is concerned, the circumlunar trajectory is\n\n~160?\n\nhr\n\nF\n\nR\n\nCAPE MOON\n\nio ir\n\nqo qr\n\ndo\n\ndr\n\ndidM\n\nFig. 7.57 Mercator projection of the outward and return phases neglecting the moon phase\n\n314 7 Navigation and Mission Design Techniques and Tools\n\n\n\ncomposed of two planar motions\u2014the two earth phases\u2014and the effect of the\n\nmoon is to change only the orientation of the plane of motion and the energy of the\n\norbit, not the position in inertial space.\n\nIn terms of right ascension and time, the longitude can be given by the following\n\nexpressions,\n\nLo \u00bc ?o ? ?eto ? ?go\nLi \u00bc ?i ? ?eti ? ?go\n\nwhere Lo, Li are longitudes and ?o, ?i are right ascensions at launch and landing,\nrespectively. The times to and ti are measured from midnight of the day of launch\n\nand ?go is the right ascension of Greenwich (or sidereal time) at midnight on the day\nof launch. The constant ?e is the spin rate of the earth. If differences are taken, then\n\nLi ? Lo \u00bc ?i ? ?o\u00f0 \u00de ? ?e ti ? t0\u00f0 \u00de\nBut, the difference in right ascension between touchdown and launch is approxi-\n\nmately the sum of the angular differences ?o and ?i shown in Fig. 7.57, where ?o\ndenotes the outward phase longitude difference and ?r the return phase longitude\ndifference. Also, (ti? to) is the total time of flight. Then,\n\nLi \u00bc Lo \u00fe ?o \u00fe ?r\u00f0 \u00de ? ?eTT \u00f07:16\u00de\n\nwhere TT denotes the total time of flight from injection to re-entry. The last two\n\nsubsections have covered some aspects of the geometry of the outward and return\n\nphases. Specifically, for the outward phase, the latitude of the Cape and the launch\n\nazimuth determine the outward phase inclination. The coast Type and the position\n\nof the moon fix the orientation of the trajectory plane in space. Figure 7.58 presents\n\nthe angular difference ?o as a function of the inclination, Type, and declination of\nthe moon.\n\nFor the return phase, it has been shown that the in-plane angle from the moon to\n\ntouchdown is approximately 160? for a reentry angle of 96?. Fixing the position of\nthe moon, the touchdown latitude and the reentry maneuver angle determine the\n\norientation of the return phase in space and specifically the angle ?r. Figures 7.59\nand 7.60 present this angle for maneuver angles of 40? and 60?, respectively. The\nvalue of ?r for a maneuver angle of 20? is 180? for all return inclinations since the\nin-plane angle is approximately this value.\n\nOnce ?o and ?r have been found and the total flight time TT is known, Eq. (7.16)\ncan be used to determine the touchdown longitude. Understand that this equation is\n\napproximate and that the greatest error is probably introduced by the flight time TT.\n\nThe rotation of the earth is about 15? per hour so that an error of 1 h in the flight time\ncauses the landing longitude to be off by 15?.

Thus, if (?o + ?r) is known, the touchdown longitude can be found by\nadding this sum to the longitude constant.\n\nExample:\n\nAssume that the spacecraft is launched from the Cape into the moon\u2019s orbit plane on\n\na particular day when the moon is at Position A and at a declination of ?15?. If the\nspacecraft is to come within 100 nautical miles of the surface of the moon, then the\n\nFixed Pericynthion Altitude condition applies. Further, if the return inclination is to\n\nbe ?40?, then Fig. 7.41 indicates that the outward and the return flight times must\nbe 61.5 h and 64.8 h, respectively. The total flight time is 126.3 h. Also, if the re-\n\nentry maneuver angle is 40? and the touchdown latitude 30?, then ir\u00bc?56? from\nFig. 7.55 and ?r\u00bc 198? from Fig. 7.59. Figure 7.58 for a Type (2) coast gives\n?o\u00bc 240? for io\u00bc 28.5? at the Cape. The sum (?o + ?r)\u00bc 438? (mod 360?)\u00bc 78?.\nFinally, with a flight time of about 126 h, Fig. 7.61 gives L\u00bc 180? for the longitude\nconstant. Adding 78? results in 258? (or ?102?) as the touchdown longitude. This\nlanding site would be somewhere in Texas.\n\nSince the touchdown longitude will most likely be a chosen parameter, it is\n\ndesirable to solve this problem in reverse.\n\nExample:What position of themoonwill produce a specified touchdown latitude?\n\nThe total flight time can be chosen by other considerations such as how close the\n\nspacecraft is to come to the moon\u2019s surface. The longitude constant can then be\n\nfound and the sum (?o + ?r) must then be a definite amount. Figures 7.58, 7.59, and\n7.60 can then be used to determine which declination of the moon will result in the\n\ncorrect sum. Note that ?r will vary only about 25? for ?r\u00bc 40? and by about 45? for\n?r\u00bc 60?. The variation of ?o is much more extensive: about 180? for the whole\nrange of declinations for the moon and Type (2) coast. Thus, if the declination of the\n\nmoon, or day of launch, is to be chosen, varying the launch azimuth will result in a\n\nwide range of possible touchdown latitudes.\n\nCategory (7): Some Additional Parameters\n\nThe reference \u201cAn Analysis of Free-Flight Circumlunar Trajectories\u201d by Paul A.\n\nPenzo gives parametric plots of additional parameters, including the following:\n\n1.

But Apollo\n\n13 experienced a major failure en route to the moon after leaving the free-\n\nreturn trajectory and before arriving at the moon.\n\n(a) If all of Apollo 13\u2019s rockets had then been inoperable, determine its orbit\n\nafter the flyby of the moon and the fate of the three astronauts, Lovell,\n\nHaise, and Swigert. In particular, how close would the spacecraft have\n\ncome to the earth and how far would the spacecraft have travelled from\n\nthe earth? If the orbit is closed, what is the period of that orbit? It is not\n\nnecessary to consider subsequent gravity assists from the moon or colli-\n\nsion with the moon.\n\n(b) Fortunately, the astronauts were able to use the propulsion systems of the\n\nLunar Module (LM) to perform trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs)\n\nto return safely to the earth. The first of the TCMs returned the spacecraft,\n\nconsisting of the Command Module (CM) and the Lunar Module, to a\n\nfree-return trajectory. For mass data, use the value of the mass of the CM\n\nas 28,945 kg and the mass of the LM as 15,235 kg. The LM propulsion\n\nsystems used nitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer and unsymmetrical\n\ndimethyl hydrazine (UDMH) hypergolic as the propellant.

Formation flying (FF) requires the\n\ndistributed spacecraft to exert collaborative control of their mutual positions and\n\norientations.\n\nThe spacecraft FF problem of maintaining the relative orbit of a cluster of\n\nsatellites that must continuously orbit each other is sensitive to relative orbit\n\nmodeling errors. Making linearization assumptions, for example, can potentially\n\nlead to a substantial fuel cost. The reason is that this formation must be maintained\n\nover the entire life span of the satellites, not for a short duration in the life span as,\n\nfor example, in rendezvous and docking. If a relative orbit is designed using a very\n\nsimplified orbit model, then the formation stationkeeping control law will need to\n\ncontinuously compensate for these modeling errors by burning fuel. Depending on\n\n8.2 Additional Navigation, Mission Analysis and Design, and Related Topics 329\n\nhttp://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/constellations/\n\n\nthe severity of the modeling errors, this fuel consumption could drastically reduce\n\nthe lifetime of the spacecraft formation.\n\nSelecting the cluster of satellites in formation flying to have equal type and build\n\ninsures that each satellite ideally has the same ballistic coefficient. Thus each orbit\n\nwill decay nominally at the same rate from atmospheric drag. For this case, it is\n\npossible to find analytically closed relative orbits. These relative orbits describe a\n\nfixed geometry as seen in a rotating spacecraft reference frame. Thus the relative\n\ndrag has only a secondary effect on the relative orbits. The dominant dynamical\n\neffect is then the gravitational attraction of the central body, particularly the J2\nperturbations of an oblate body, which cause secular drift in the mean ?, mean ?,\nand mean anomaly.\n\nThe reference by Schaub and Junkins provides a set of relative orbit control\n\nmethods:\n\n1.

It is even possible to direct the spacecraft towards the Sun, rather than\n\n8.2 Additional Navigation, Mission Analysis and Design, and Related Topics 331\n\n\n\naway from it, by using the photon\u2019s pressure on the sails to produce thrust in the\n\ndirection opposite to the spacecraft\u2019s motion and bring its orbit closer to the Sun.\n\nIn order for sunlight to provide sufficient pressure to propel a spacecraft forward,\n\na solar sail must capture as much sunlight as possible. This means that the surface of\n\nthe sail must be very large. Cosmos 1, a project of The Planetary Society and\n\nCosmos Studios, was to be a small solar sail intended only for a short mission.\n\nNevertheless, once it spread its sails even this small spacecraft would have been\n\n10 stories tall. Its eight triangular blades would have been 15 m (49 ft) in length and\n\nhave a total surface area of 600 square meters (6500 square feet). This is about one\n\nand a half times the size of a basketball court. Unfortunately, the launch of Cosmos\n\n1 failed to achieve orbit.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Colin R.

In less than\n\n30 min, MER morphed from a spacecraft to an aeroshell, to a complex two-, then\n\nthree-body form falling furiously through the Martian atmosphere, to a balloon\n\nencased tetrahedron jerked to a standstill and then cut loose to bounce precipitously\n\non the unknown terrain below.\n\nReferences:\n\nSee papers in the special section on planetary entry systems in the Journal of\nSpacecraft and Rockets, Vol. 36, Number 3, May\u2013June 1999.\n\nCyclers\n\nA future Earth\u2013Mars transportation systemwill probably usemany different kinds of\n\nspacecraft trajectories. For example, some trajectories are well suited for human\n\ntransportation, whereas others are better suited for ferrying supplies. One potentially\n\nuseful type of trajectory is the Earth\u2013Mars cycler trajectory, or cycler. A spacecraft\n\non a cycler regularly passes close to both Earth and Mars (but never stops at either).\n\nThe \u201cpassenger\u201d vehicle enters or leaves the cycler at the appropriate planet. Cyclers\n\n332 8 Further Study\n\n\n\nthat require propulsive maneuvers are referred to as powered cyclers, whereas\n\ncyclers that rely only on gravitational forces are referred to as ballistic cyclers.\n\nThere are some variations on cyclers, in which the spacecraft enters a temporary\n\nparking orbit at Mars (semi-cyclers), at earth (reverse semi-cyclers), or at both earth\n\nand Mars (stop-over cyclers). Reference 2 analyzes all cyclers that repeat every two\n\nsynodic periods and have one intermediate earth encounter. In the reference, the\n\nEarth\u2013Mars synodic period is assumed, at least initially, to be 2 1/7 years.\n\nBuzz Aldrin devised a transit system between Earth and Mars known as the\n\n\u201cAldrin Mars Cycler.\u201d \u201cAldrin\u2019s system of cycling spacecraft makes travel to Mars\n\npossible using far less propellant than conventional means, with an expected five\n\nand a half month journey from the Earth to Mars, and a return trip to Earth of about\n\nthe same duration on a twin semi-cycler. . . . In each cycle when the Aldrin Cycler\u2019s\ntrajectory swings it by the Earth, a smaller Earth-departing interceptor spacecraft\n\nferries crew and cargo up to dock with the Cycler spacecraft.\u201d\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Discovery\n\n2. Reacquisition for Confirmation\n\n3. Provisional (Temporary) Name, e.g., 1999 TL10\n\n4. Number and name designation, e.g., 1 Ceres, 4 Vesta, 9007 James Bond (Closest\n\napproach to earth at 1.516 AU on 1/22/08), and 13070 Seanconnery (Closest\n\napproach to earth at 1.980 AU on 1/24/08)\n\nSome facts about asteroids are:\n\n1. The first asteroid, 1 Ceres, was discovered by Giuseppe Piazzi in January 1801.\n\n2. The Dawn spacecraft was launched on 9/27/07 to orbit Vesta and then Ceres, the\n\nonly dwarf planet in the inner solar system.\n\n3. Spacecraft flybys include, e.g., Galileo of Gaspra and Ida (and Ida\u2019s satellite\n\nDactyl), NEAR-Shoemaker of Mathilde and landing on Eros, and Stardust of\n\nAnnefrank.\n\nExample (Temporary Asteroid Name): 1999 TL10\n\nIn this name \u201c1999\u201d is the year of discovery; \u201cT\u201d denotes the half-month of its\n\ndiscovery, which is the first half of October (after skipping \u201cI\u201d because it looks too\n\nmuch like a \u201cone\u201d); and \u201cL10\u201d denotes the number of the asteroid in the half-month\n\nof its discovery. In determining the half-month, \u201cA\u201d covers January 1\u201315, \u201cB\u201d\n\nJanuary 16\u201331, \u201cC\u201d February 1\u201315, \u201cD\u201d February 16\u201328 or 29, etc. skipping I as\n\nnoted. The first letter of the pair of letters for a given month denotes the first 15 days\n\nof the month and the second of the pair denotes the rest of the month. Thus, \u201c1999\n\nTA\u201d is the temporary name of the first asteroid discovered in October, \u201c1999TB\u201d the\n\nsecond discovered in October, etc., skipping I, etc., 1999 TZ is the 25th, 1999 TA1\n\nthe 26th, etc., 1999 TZ1 the 50th, 1999 TZ2 the 51st, etc. Therefore, 1999 TL10 is\n\nthe (10? 25) + 11\u00bc 261st asteroid discovered in the first half of October 1999.\nReference: Cunningham\n\nProject Statement\n\nUse the web-interface option (method) in HORIZONS, JPL\u2019s Online Solar System\n\nData and Ephemeris Computation Service, to answer the questions in Part\n\n1.

Figure C.2\n\ncan be used to convert these injection velocities to other altitudes while holding the\n\nenergy fixed.\n\n# Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015\nG.R.

We\n\nconsider two specific types of launch trajectories:\n\nCase I for all trajectories in which the spacecraft is launched ccw wrt the earth and\n\nso that the outward-phase conic lies in the moon\u2019s orbit plane.\n\nCase II for which the spacecraft is launched normal to the moon\u2019s orbit plane. The\n\nsymmetry relationship makes it immaterial as to whether the spacecraft\n\napproaches the moon from above or below the moon\u2019s orbit plane.\n\n60\n\n35,850\n\n35,900\n\n35,950\n\nIN\nJE\n\nC\nT\n\nIO\nN\n\n V\nE\n\nLO\nC\n\nIT\nY\n\n V\n0 \n\n(F\nP\n\nS\n)\n\n36,000\n\n36,100\n\n36,050\n\n70 80\n\nOUTWARD TIME OF FLIGHT T0 (HOURS)\n\nPARKING ORBIT RADIAL DISTANCE = 0.215 \u00d7 108 FEET\n\n90\n\nA\n\nA?\n\nB\n\nD\n\nC\n\nANALYTIC PROGRAM\nEXACT PROGRAM\n\nFig. C.1 Injection velocity versus outward time of flight for various positions of the moon\nin its orbit\n\n358 Appendix C Additional Penzo Parametric Plots\n\n\n\nCase I and Case II represent outward-phase launches in the moon\u2019s orbit plane\n\nand normal to the moon\u2019s plane, respectively. Qualitatively, we can deduce that the\n\nlonger the flight time is to the moon the larger the PME angle. Also, from Fig. C.1,\n\nsince shorter distances of the moon require lower injection velocities for a given\n\nflight time, the PME angle will increase for these shorter distances.\n\nC.3 Moon-Phase Parameters: v1, EMP Angle at SoI Exit,\nand the B-Plane\n\nFigure C.4 presents the moon-phase hyperbolic excess velocity as a function of the\n\noutward time of flight and the distance of the moon. The injection velocity is\n\nessentially independent of the outward inclination, but the v1 is not. For Case II,\nthis velocity is from 400 to 800 fps greater than that for Case I. Exact integration\n\n(precision) software was run to provide a comparison with the analytic software.\n\nThe exact integration software consistently produced a higher value for v1 than the\nanalytic program.\n\nAn estimate for the earth-moon-probe (EMP) angle at exit from the SoI is given\n\nin Figs. C.5 and C.6. The behavior of this angle is similar to the PME angle.

Note that the EMP angle increases as the return\n\ninclination rotates from ccw to cw.\n\nFinally, traces of the (impact) B-vector measured in the (impact) B-plane are\n\npresented in Fig. C.7. The B-plane is defined to be perpendicular to the incoming\n\nhyperbolic asymptote. The horizontal or B\u2022T axis lies in the moon\u2019s orbit plane and\nis directed positively opposite the moon\u2019s direction of motion. The vertical or B\u2022R\naxis is directed positively below the moon\u2019s orbit plane. The origin is fixed to the\n\ncenter of the moon. For all circumlunar trajectories considered here, the asymptote\n\nis inclined only ?10\t to the moon\u2019s orbit plane. The PME angle, which indicates\nthe position of the asymptote wrt the earth-moon line, also indicates the position of\n\nthe impact parameter plane. Since this angle varies greatly with time of flight,\n\noutward inclination, and position of the moon, the impact parameter plane is\n\noriented differently from the earth-moon line for each point in Fig. C.7.\n\nBoth graphs in Fig. C.7 are drawn for the maximum distance of the moon.
