Russell \u00b7 V. Angelopoulos\n\nPublished online: 22 March 2012\n\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012\n\nThe Moon\u2019s space environment, tenuous neutral exosphere, wake, surface and interior have\nbeen studied with single spacecraft missions since the beginning of the space age: The\nApollo missions extended not only the human experience to the lunar surface but also car-\nried our extended eyes and ears to the lunar surface and into lunar orbit to study for the\nfirst time how the solar wind interacts with airless bodies and, using magnetic induction,\nto probe the interior core properties. Since then, the US Clementine, Lunar Prospector and\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter missions, ESA\u2019s SMART-1, the Japanese Kaguya, the Indian\nChandrayaan and the Chinese Chang\u2019e I and II missions have revealed with greater detail\nproperties of lunar crustal magnetism and surface composition, while analysis of Apollo\nsamples have rewritten textbooks regarding the formation of the Earth-Moon system and\nSolar System evolution. It has become apparent recently that to make further progress in\nunderstanding the complex interaction of the Moon\u2019s surface with its space environment, as\nwell as to better probe the Moon\u2019s interior with natural electromagnetic signals from above,\nsingle point measurements are inadequate. The solar wind buffeting the surface never stays\nconstant: it varies on the time-scales that correspond to deep electromagnetic sounding and\non spatial scales comparable to several lunar radii, rendering distant spacecraft (e.g., ones at\nthe Earth-Sun Lagrange point) ineffective monitors of the local drivers.\n\nAt a distance of 55\u201365 Earth radii, the Moon spends most of its time upstream of Earth\u2019s\nbow shock, and is thus exposed to either the pristine solar wind or to showers of parti-\ncles emitted by the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. Once per lunar month the Moon\ntraverses Earth\u2019s magnetotail at a woefully undersampled region where magnetic reconnec-\ntion, plasma turbulence and particle acceleration are commonplace and have far-reaching\nconsequences for magnetospheric plasma circulation. Lunar orbits, therefore, are ideal plat-\nforms for observation and study of the pristine solar wind that impacts Earth, distant effects\nat shocks, and the dominant method of energy release in the magnetosphere, namely dis-\ntant magnetotail reconnection. Typical studies of these phenomena have, again, been con-\n\nC.T. Russell (?) \u00b7 V.

Angelopoulos\n\nducted only with single spacecraft missions. Thus, spatial extent, spatio-temporal ambigui-\nties, three-dimensional effects and dynamical evolution could only be loosely inferred in the\npast but not duly explored.\n\nRecognizing the scientific return from a two-point investigation from the Moon and of\nthe Moon, the NASA/THEMIS team embarked upon a bold initiative to use the excess fuel\ncapacity of two of the five spacecraft in the THEMIS constellation orbiting Earth and send\nthem via low-thrust trajectories in orbit about the Moon. From those stable, yet scientifi-\ncally optimal orbits, the two spacecraft would conduct unprecedented observations of the\nsolar wind driver and its interaction with the lunar exosphere, crustal magnetism, lunar sur-\nface (wake), and lunar interior, as well as perform two-point observations of the solar wind,\nits interaction with the magnetosphere, and magnetotail reconnection and their effects (plas-\nmoids, particle acceleration and turbulence) in the distant magnetotail. Hence the ARTEMIS\nmission was born out of THEMIS.\n\nARTEMIS has been a mission of several \u201cfirsts\u201d. It is the first mission to employ\ntwo identical coordinated spacecraft at the Moon, the first mission to conduct prolonged\n(9 month) observations and station-keeping at an Earth-Moon Lagrange point, the first to\nprovide DC electric field measurements at the lunar space environment, and the first to\nprovide comprehensive in-situ measurements in the lunar space environment from a high\naltitude lunar orbit.\n\nIn the compendium of papers in this volume V. Angelopoulos describes the ARTEMIS\nmission, and T. Sweetser and colleagues present its circuitous, mission-enabling, low thrust\ntrajectory design. Its broad scientific objectives spanning heliophysics and planetary goals\nare described by D. Sibeck and colleagues, and the first results from the mission, obtained\nduring a lunar flyby enroute to a translunar orbit injection by the ARTEMIS P1 spacecraft\nare presented by J. Halekas and colleagues. The latter provides an exposition of the scientific\npotential from the instrumentation aboard that has been operating nominally five years after\nlaunch of the ARTEMIS hardware into space. The spacecraft and instrumentation, including\nsalient features of calibration and generic data interpretation, have been described in the\nTHEMIS Space Science Reviews volume (Angelopoulos 2008).\n\nWe hope that the present volume will be useful to researchers in both heliophysics and\nplanetary physics for understanding published scientific results from the mission and in\norder to aid their own analysis and data interpretation efforts from these publicly available\ndatasets.\n\nFebruary 23, 2012\n\nAcknowledgements We greatly appreciate the efforts of the editorial staff at the Space Science Reviews, in\nparticular Mr. Randy Cruz for his rapid and efficient processing of the submissions, and the figures, Mr. Em-\nmanuel Masongsong for interfacing with authors and editors, Ms. Judy Hohl for editorial assistance with the\nmanuscripts and Ms. Marjorie Sowmendran at the University of California, Los Angeles, for interfacing with\nthe referees, authors and publishers.\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. Ayako Matsuoka who stepped in to edit the articles for which the editors were con-\nflicted.

By repositioning\ntwo of the five THEMIS probes (P1 and P2) in coordinated, lunar equatorial orbits, at dis-\ntances of ?55\u201365 RE geocentric (?1.1\u201312 RL selenocentric), ARTEMIS will perform the\nfirst systematic, two-point observations of the distant magnetotail, the solar wind, and the\nlunar space and planetary environment. The primary heliophysics science objectives of the\nmission are to study from such unprecedented vantage points and inter-probe separations\nhow particles are accelerated at reconnection sites and shocks, and how turbulence develops\nand evolves in Earth\u2019s magnetotail and in the solar wind. Additionally, the mission will de-\ntermine the structure, formation, refilling, and downstream evolution of the lunar wake and\nexplore particle acceleration processes within it. ARTEMIS\u2019s orbits and instrumentation will\nalso address key lunar planetary science objectives: the evolution of lunar exospheric and\nsputtered ions, the origin of electric fields contributing to dust charging and circulation, the\nstructure of the lunar interior as inferred by electromagnetic sounding, and the lunar sur-\nface properties as revealed by studies of crustal magnetism. ARTEMIS is synergistic with\nconcurrent NASA missions LRO and LADEE and the anticipated deployment of the Inter-\nnational Lunar Network. It is expected to be a key element in the NASA Heliophysics Great\nObservatory and to play an important role in international plans for lunar exploration.\n\nKeywords THEMIS \u00b7 ARTEMIS \u00b7 Magnetosphere \u00b7 Reconnection \u00b7 Solar wind \u00b7\nTurbulence \u00b7 Lunar exosphere\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe \u201cAcceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon\u2019s Inter-\naction with the Sun\u201d (ARTEMIS) mission is a two-spacecraft (\u201cprobe\u201d) complement that\n\nV.

Angelopoulos\n\naddresses key science questions related to both heliophysics science as observed from/at\nthe lunar environment and the lunar exosphere, surface, and interior. The mission concept\nutilizes the two outermost satellites of the NASA MIDEX mission THEMIS (Angelopoulos\n2008), a five identical satellite mission launched on 17 February 2007 to study the origin\nof the magnetospheric substorms, a fundamental space weather process (Sibeck and An-\ngelopoulos 2008).\n\nFrom distances hundreds of kilometers to 120,000 km (from the Moon and at variable\ninter-probe separations optimized for heliophysics science, the two ARTEMIS probes will\nstudy: (i) particle acceleration, reconnection, and turbulence in the magnetosphere and (ii)\nin the solar wind; and (iii) the electrodynamics of the lunar environment. With its unique,\ncoordinated, two-point measurements, ARTEMIS will reveal the dynamics, scale size, and\nevolution of the distant tail, the 3-dimensional structure of solar wind shocks, and the struc-\nture, evolution and kinetic properties of the lunar wake. ARTEMIS builds on our under-\nstanding of the magnetotail and solar wind environment at lunar distances that was acquired\nfrom ISEE3 (Tsurutani and von Rosenvinge 1984), Geotail (Nishida 1994) and Wind (Acu\u00f1a\net al. 1995). ARTEMIS will also advance our understanding the Moon\u2019s wake going beyond\nthe observations from Wind high altitude (10 RL) wake crossings and the low (?100 km)\naltitude wake and exospheric observations by Lunar Prospector (LP, Hubbard et al. 1998;\nBinder 1998), Kaguya (e.g., Saito et al. 2010) and Chang\u2019E. ARTEMIS\u2019s comprehensive\nplasma and fields observations over an extensive range of distances from low to high al-\ntitudes fill an observational gap in wake behavior and extend the measurement capability\nby including DC electric field observations and a two spacecraft complement. ARTEMIS\u2019s\nmulti-point observations, orbits, and instrumentation are also ideally suited to advance our\nknowledge of several key topics raised in the 2003 National Research Council\u2019s (NRC)\nDecadal Survey for Solar System Exploration and several prioritized science concepts listed\nin the 2007 National Academy of Sciences (NAC) report, \u201cThe Scientific Context for Explo-\nration of the Moon\u201d. With all its instruments operating flawlessly and from the achievable\n100 km perigee altitude, ?10\u00b0 inclination orbit, ARTEMIS could contribute greatly to our\nunderstanding of the formation and evolution of the exosphere, dust levitation by electric\nfields, the crustal fields and regolith properties and the interior of the Moon. By optimizing\nperiselene to obtain low-altitude passes below 100 km and inclinations as high as 20\u00b0 to\nreach the outskirts of the South Pole\u2014Aitken basin, the ARTEMIS team can further op-\ntimize the science return from the mission for planetary science in its prime or extended\nphase.\n\nThis paper describes the ARTEMIS mission concept. Following an overview of the mis-\nsion history, instrument and spacecraft capabilities, and mission phases (Sect. 1), Sect. 2\npresents the scientific objectives in relation to the mission design. Section 3 discusses the\naspects of mission design that enabled optimal science within the capabilities of spacecraft\nalready in orbit. Section 4 describes the unique features of the ARTEMIS operations that\nwere critical in achieving the heliophysics and planetary aspects of the mission. This sec-\ntion also provides an overview of the data processing and data dissemination system as\nit has evolved through the successful THEMIS mission practices and is now applied on\nARTEMIS. Detailed aspects of the scientific objectives, mission design, navigation, opera-\ntions, and first results will be presented in future publications.\n\n2 Overview\n\nARTEMIS arose well into the THEMIS mission\u2019s Phase-C development cycle, when it\nwas recognized that Earth shadows exceeding the spacecraft bus thermal design limits\n\nReprinted from the journal 4\n\n\n\nThe ARTEMIS Mission\n\nwould threaten THEMIS probes TH-B (P1) and TH-C (P2) during their third tail sea-\nson. This was destined to happen on March 2010, about six months after the end of the\nprime mission (Fig. 1(a)). Additionally, at that time the angles between the lines of ap-\nsides for P1 and P2 would be 54\u00b0 and 27\u00b0 away from those of P3, P4, and P5, render-\ning the classic five-probe conjunctions of the prime THEMIS mission design non-optimal.\nPreliminary studies by NASA/JPL in 2005 indicated that by placing P1 and P2 into lu-\nnar orbits (Fig. 1(b)) using a low-thrust lunar capture mission design, the risk of freez-\ning would be avoided as the shadow durations would become small and manageable.\nThe potential of P1 and P2 for scientific discovery could be further maximized for helio-\nphysics science by careful optimization of the mission design to result in variable inter-\nprobe separation vectors relative to the Sun-Moon and Sun-Earth line. This optimization\nwas the genesis of the ARTEMIS concept. An ARTEMIS science team was formed at\nthat point to define the scientific goals of the mission and worked on science optimization.\nThe mission was approved by the NASA Heliophysics Senior Review panel in May 2008\n(http://wind.nasa.gov/docs/Senior_Review_2008_Report_Final.pdf), and ARTEMIS opera-\ntions commenced on July 20th, 2009\u2014coinciding with the 40th anniversary of NASA\u2019s first\nlunar landing.\n\nWith the prime THEMIS mission successfully completed by September 2009 and with\nfuel margins on P1 and P2 remaining robust, the ARTEMIS implementation is proceeding\nas planned. Three lunar flybys in January-March of 2010 resulting in translunar injections\n(TLI) will place the probes in orbits near the Earth-Sun Lagrange points. These flybys are\nalso expected to provide a first glimpse into the type of ARTEMIS lunar wake data to be\nexpected from the nominal mission. Following a series of Earth flybys in 2010, the two\nprobes are expected to reach Lissajous orbits (the Lagrange points of the Earth-Moon sys-\ntem) in October 2010 and enter into lunar orbits in April 2011. Figure 2 shows the geometry\nof those orbits in a coordinate system centered at the Moon, with X-axis opposite Earth,\nZ axis perpendicular to the Earth-Moon orbit plane, positive North, and Y axis complet-\ning the right-hand coordinate system. Very little fuel is needed to move a probe from the\nLunar Lagrange point 1 (LL1) on the Earth side, to the LL2, opposite to Earth. Very little\nfuel is required to maintain the spacecraft from one Lagrange point to the other, resulting in\nsemi-periodic Lissajous orbits in this coordinate system.\n\nThe ARTEMIS team has been given the go-ahead to implement a 2 year mission. The\nprobes\u2019 radiation safety margin, robust instrumentation, and stable orbits, however, make the\nmission capable of providing high quality measurements of the lunar environment during the\nnext solar cycle. Table 1 outlines the mission phases, durations, and typical orbit separations\nin each phase and links them to the science objectives discussed above and in Sect. 2. The\nmission phases are as follows: The two probes, P1 and P2, arrive at the Lissajous orbits,\non opposite sides of the Moon, on September 1, 2010 (P1, near-side) and October 19, 2010\n(P2, far-side), respectively. The insertion of P2 is gradual, such that useful tail and solar wind\ntwo-probe conjunctions can commence as early as September 21, 2010. The probes stay in\nthis configuration until January 8, 2011. In the Lissajous orbits, although the probes hover\n?60,000 km away from the Moon along the Earth-Moon line (on their respective sides of\nthe Moon), they are librating along their orbit-tracks about Earth, \u00b160,000 km ahead of or\nbehind the Moon. This strategy results in a variety of P1-P2 conjunctions with inter-probe\nseparations of 60,000\u2013120,000 km (dR ? 10\u201320 RE , or 35\u201370 RL) that are either along\nthe Sun-Earth line or across it; those conjunctions can be either in the solar wind, or in\nthe magnetotail and magnetosheath. This strategy also results in six long-range lunar wake\ncrossings by either P1 or P2 from around 20 and 30 RL. Figure 3(a) shows snapshots of\ntwo possible relative positions of P1 and P2 in the magnetosphere and the solar wind. Due\n\n5 Reprinted from the journal\n\nhttp://wind.nasa.gov/docs/Senior_Review_2008_Report_Final.pdf\n\n\nV.

Differential precession of the line\nof apsides prevents conjunctions between probes along the Earth\u2019s magnetotail. In addition, long Earth shad-\nows in March 2010 (not shown) would have presented a problem to mission safety. Bottom: The ARTEMIS\nmission raises the apogees of P1 and P2 such that they are captured into lunar orbits, resulting in new science\nfrom the lunar environment\n\nto the sensitivity of the orbit profile to initial (capture) conditions and to orbit maintenance\nmaneuvers, the exact times of those conjunctions may vary but their overall nature will\nremain qualitatively the same. This mission phase, which is denoted as Lunar Lagrange\npoints 1 and 2 phase, or \u201cLL1,2\u201d, lasts approximately 3 months.\n\nIn early January 2011, probe P1 will be commanded to leave its Lissajous orbit on the far\nside and enter orbit into the Lunar Lagrange point 1, or LL1, on the near-side of the Moon.\nAt different phases of their Lissajous orbits, the two probes (P1 and P2) reside at inter-\nprobe separation vectors of size 5\u201320 RE , with longer ranges preferentially across the Earth-\nMoon line and shorter ranges along the Sun-Earth line. Figure 3(b) shows two snapshots of\nsuch possible configurations. Another six lunar crossings are also acquired in this phase,\nfrom distances around 10\u201330 RL (most are around 15\u201320 RL); those wake crossings occur\ntypically far upstream of Earth\u2019s bow shock and are pristine, i.e., least affected by Earth\n\nReprinted from the journal 6\n\n\n\nThe ARTEMIS Mission\n\nFig. 2 ARTEMIS Lissajous\norbits in the initial phase of the\nmission, shown here for the case\nof P1 (adapted from Broschart\net al. 2009; also see Sweetser\net al. 2010)\n\nforeshock effects. This phase lasts another 3 months, until early April, 2011. It is denoted\nLunar Lagrange point 1 phase, or \u201cLL1\u201d phase.\n\nIn early April 2011 P1 will be commanded to insert into lunar orbit by performing a\nseries of periselene burn maneuvers; P2 will follow suit in late April. By May 2011 both\nP1 and P2 will be in stable equatorial, high-eccentricity orbits, of ?100 km \u00d7 19,000 km\naltitude. These are stable, 26 h period orbits with inter-probe separations 500 km\u20135RE . One\nprobe will be in a retrograde and the other in a pro-grade orbit, such that the precession\nrates of their line of apsides will walk relative to each other by 15\u201320 degrees per month;\nin ?2 years the lines of apsides will cover a full circle, resulting in a wide range of inter-\nprobe vectors relative to the Sun-Earth line and lunar wake crossings from a wide range of\naltitudes. A subset of orbits resulting in simultaneous, two-probe crossings of the lunar wake\nis also possible during certain mission phases, when one of the two probes is at apoapsis\nalong the Sun-Moon line behind the Moon (Fig. 3(c)).\n\nThe ARTEMIS spacecraft (probes) are identical. A probe in deployed configuration and\nthe instrument field of views are shown pictorially in Fig. 4. The probes, which are spin-\nstabilized platforms (Harvey et al. 2008) with 3 s spin period, carry body-mounted particle\ninstruments and tethered fields instruments. The spin axis is nominally maintained at an\nangle < 10 deg to the ecliptic South (unlike probes P3, 4, and 5, which have spin axes due\nclose to ecliptic North). The probes are equipped with monopropellant hydrazine propulsion\nsystems, capable of providing ?1.5 N of thrust at ISP ? 210 s near the end of mission.\nManeuvers are typically side-thrusts. Axial thrusts provide, when necessary to combine with\nside-thrusts, a vector thrust off of the spin plane, when necessary to match precisely the\nspecified ?V vector. Attitude sensors include a Sun sensor, two backup rate gyros, and the\nscience magnetometer (useful for attitude knowledge only near perigee). For ARTEMIS,\naway from Earth\u2019s strong field, the primary attitude sensor is thus the Sun sensor, used to\nderive full spin attitude information by modeling Sun motion as a function of time over a\nperiod of days to weeks. Attitude predicts from thrust and vehicle performance modeling\nare typically characterized well enough that the Sun sensor is used to check and re-set the\nabsolute attitude whenever possible in-between thrust operations.\n\nThe particle instruments ESA and SST (fields of view shown in Fig. 4) measure ther-\nmal and super-thermal ions and electrons. Sun pulse information is used to sector data into\n3D distribution functions over the period of one spin. The fields instruments, FGM, SCM,\nand EFI, measure with state-of-the-art cadence, offset stability and sensitivity the DC and\nAC magnetic and electric fields. Table 2 shows the main instruments and the reference in\nwhich more information about instrument characteristics can be obtained. Radiation dose\nmargin of 2, latch-up protection circuitry and memory scrubbing have been implemented on\nthe instruments and selectively on the spacecraft (Harvey et al. 2008).

Since the ther-\nmal and radiation design have been optimized for the worst-case environment, which is the\none experienced by the inner THEMIS probes (on one-day period orbits, at 12 RE apogee),\nthe outer probes have seen significantly less cumulative thermal cycling and radiation (by\napproximately a factor of 2\u20134) relative to their design limit. Additionally, the outer probes\nwere, by selection, the ones with more robust communication and power systems behavior.\nBy virtue of the probes\u2019 stable lunar orbits, the relatively benign radiation environment at\nthe Moon and the ARTEMIS operations (Sect. 3), it is expected that the ARTEMIS lifetime\nwill be a good fraction of the upcoming solar cycle.\n\n3 Science Objectives\n\nThis section is an outline of the ARTEMIS mission\u2019s key scientific objectives as they relate\nto mission requirements. Although ARTEMIS was designed to address heliophysics sci-\nence objectives, moderate mission redesign enables it to optimize its observation strategy to\naddress planetary objectives, as well.\n\n3.1 Heliophysics Science Objectives\n\nFigure 5 shows the three regimes to be visited by the ARTEMIS probes once the science\noperations phase has commenced, i.e., once both ARTEMIS probes are at the lunar environ-\n\n9 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nV. Angelopoulos\n\nFig. 4 Pictorial view of ARTEMIS probes and instrumentation. The spin-stabilized probes have a spin axis\ndue ecliptic south, and a nominal spin period of 3 s. The fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) and Search Coil\nmagnetometer (SCM) are on carbon epoxy, rigid, deployable booms of ?2 m and ?1 m length, respectively.\nThe axial electric field (EFIa) whip sensors are at the tips of 3.5 m stacker booms and the spin plane electric\nfield (EFIs) spherical sensors are on 20 and 25 m wire booms (truncated, not to scale in this picture). Ion\nand electron fields of view for the Solid State Telescope (SST) instrument are shown in different colors. The\nelectrostatic analyzer (ESA) detector points radially outward and measures ions and electrons with identical\nfields of view\n\nment. ARTEMIS will address questions related to acceleration, reconnection, and turbulence\nin both regions visited by the Moon once per 28 days in its orbit about Earth: (i) the mag-\nnetosphere and (ii) the solar wind. Additionally, ARTEMIS will traverse the lunar wake\nroutinely with one or both probes and will address questions related to (iii) the wake forma-\ntion, refilling, structure, and evolution, as well as kinetic aspects of particle acceleration a\nthe wake.\n\nIn the magnetosphere, brief passes by previous spacecraft, such as ISEE-3, Geotail,\nGalileo, and Wind, have demonstrated that the distant magnetotail at 55\u201365 RE hosts a\nvariety of fundamental plasma physics phenomena: quasi-steady reconnection resulting in\nheated plasma jets, beams of energized particles, twisted and/or unusually cold and dense\nplasma sheets, and turbulence. The distant reconnection line is thought to reside at 55\u2013\n65 RE from Earth, at times, making the lunar orbit particularly interesting for studies of\nglobal magnetotail circulation. The fundamental processes occurring there are common to\nother planetary and astrophysical systems. Additionally, the magnetotail at lunar distances\nis an ideal place to study the integrated output from the near-Earth processing of stored\nsolar wind energy in the form of heated/accelerated flows and plasmoids. ARTEMIS will\nstudy these phenomena for the first time both comprehensively and systematically from the\nunique perspective afforded by its two identical probes. In the magnetosphere, ARTEMIS\nwill address:\n\n\u2022 How are particles accelerated up to hundreds of keV? Using simultaneous measurements\nin the lobe or mantle and in the plasma sheet, ARTEMIS will determine the mechanism\nof particle heating in the distant tail. The first-ever simultaneous measurements of en-\nergy inflow and particle heating will distinguish between competing particle acceleration\n\nReprinted from the journal 10\n\n\n\nThe ARTEMIS Mission\n\nTable 2 ARTEMIS instruments and their capability. Survey data collection ensures plasma moments and spin\nfits of DC electric and magnetic fields, and nominal frequency spectra are transmitted throughout all orbits,\nwhereas particle burst and embedded wave burst spectra ensure the highest cadence and spectral resolution\nfields and particles data during select intervals. Like on THEMIS, ARTEMIS bursts are selected using on-\nboard triggers aimed at instances of high activity and include pre-burst buffers, or time-based triggers (e.g.\nperiselenes)\n\nInstrument Specs Reference\n\nFGM:\nFluxgate\nMagnetometer\n\nDC magnetic field\nSampling rate & resolution: DC-128\nSamples/s & 3 pT\nOffset stability <0.2 nT/12 hr\n\nAuster et al.

In the absence of multipoint measure-\nments, even the most basic characteristics of fast flows and plasmoid evolution in the tail\nremain poorly understood. Understanding these phenomena is important for determining\nhow the distant tail reconnection process affects global flux and energy circulation, as\nwell as the amount and extent of particle energization in the near-Earth environment. Ra-\ndial separations of 1\u201310 RE parallel to the Sun-Earth line will enable the two ARTEMIS\nprobes and allied near-Earth spacecraft to track the evolution of high speed flows and\nplasmoids. Azimuthal probe separations will enable ARTEMIS to determine the cross-\ntail extent, orientation, shape, and topology of plasmoids. ARTEMIS will thus determine\nthe characteristics and effects of reconnection in the distant magnetotail, from structural,\nmagneto-hydrodynamic scales down to ion gyroradius and ion inertial length scales.\n\n\u2022 What are the drivers and effects of turbulence? Turbulent dissipation is an effective mech-\nanism for heating fluids and transferring mass, momentum, and energy. Characterizing\nthe nature of these fluctuations and determining their origin and dissipation are therefore\nimportant for global circulation. Unlike the solar wind, for which time-series of near-\nconstant velocity data can be interpreted as spatial fluctuations, tail flows are unsteady\nand the above simplification, enabling single spacecraft measurements of the turbulent\nflows, does not apply. To determine the drivers and effects of turbulence, the spatial and\ntemporal variations of plasma and magnetic field measurements over a wide range of so-\nlar wind conditions and scale lengths must be measured. ARTEMIS\u2019s two-point measure-\n\n11 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nV. Angelopoulos\n\nFig. 5 ARTEMIS depicted by science region. Every 28 days probes P1 and P2 will traverse the magneto-\nsphere, the solar wind and (multiple times) the lunar wake, addressing key questions in Heliophysics\n\nments at separations of a few hundred kilometers to several RE in directions transverse\nto the Sun-Earth line, and in conjunction with upstream solar wind monitors, will pin-\npoint the origin of, establish the external conditions for, and characterize the nature of\nmagnetotail turbulence.\n\nIn the solar wind, where ARTEMIS will spend more than 80% of its time, it will uti-\nlize its two-point measurement capability to address long-standing questions concerning the\nphysics of solar wind particle acceleration in collisionless shocks and turbulence. Specifi-\ncally, in the solar wind, ARTEMIS will address:\n\n\u2022 How are particles accelerated at shocks? At interplanetary shocks, shock undulations are\nexpected to host preliminary acceleration sites for solar energetic particle events and pro-\nvide the seed population for particle acceleration for 10 to 100 MeV energies. Multiple\nspacecraft at appropriate scales are required to properly identify and study this 2D or\neven 3D phenomenon. Moreover, Earth\u2019s bow shock and foreshock are also excellent lo-\ncations for studying the fundamental processes of particle acceleration. At lunar distances,\nwhere particles were first observed by the Apollo sub-satellites to have been diffusively\naccelerated at the bow shock, the acceleration process continues at rates that depend on\nspacecraft depth and distance to the point of tangency, as well as on upstream conditions.\nARTEMIS orbits will sample the foreshock at various distances from the tangent line\nand at various solar wind conditions. ARTEMIS\u2019s direct inter-probe comparisons of up-\nstream fluxes will provide a wealth of new information regarding the e-folding lengths\nof the diffusive acceleration process over key distances (0.1 to 20 RE). ARTEMIS will\naccurately characterize the properties of interplanetary shock acceleration and diffusive\nparticle acceleration at the Earth\u2019s bow shock and foreshock.\n\n\u2022 What are the nature and extent of low-shear reconnection? Recent observations of recon-\nnection \u201cexhaust\u201d regions have led to the identification of reconnection lines extending\nhundreds of Earth radii in the solar wind (Phan et al. 2006). Comprehensive examination\nof this phenomenon, and in particular the low-shear magnetic reconnection case, which\n\nReprinted from the journal 12\n\n\n\nThe ARTEMIS Mission\n\ncould be ubiquitous amongst stellar wind plasmas, is still lagging due to the scarcity of si-\nmultaneous high time resolution measurements on multiple nearby solar wind monitors.\nARTEMIS\u2019s two probe high cadence plasma measurements, both alone and combined\nwith other solar wind monitors, will enable fundamental studies of the most common,\nlow-shear reconnection in the solar wind over scales ranging from tens to hundreds of RE .\n\n\u2022 What are the properties of the inertial range of turbulence? The solar wind is an excellent\nlaboratory for the study of turbulence. Understanding the properties of the inertial range\nis important for modeling solar wind evolution through the heliosphere and for providing\nconstraints on kinetic theories of energy cascade and dissipation in space plasmas in gen-\neral. The crucial range, of the turbulent energy cascade at 1\u201320 RE , however, has not been\nstudied due to lack of appropriate satellite conjunctions. ARTEMIS\u2019s two-point measure-\nments in the solar wind will fill an important gap in the study of the properties of solar\nwind turbulent cascade in the inertial regime and in determining how critical turbulence\nscale lengths vary under different solar wind conditions.\n\nAt the lunar wake, the interaction region between the solar wind and the Moon,\nARTEMIS will have a unique opportunity to understand a wealth of basic physics phenom-\nena pertaining to plasma expansion into a vacuum, applicable to many other astrophysical\nplasmas (voids in tori around Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn, the International space station, and\nHubble). There ARTEMIS will answer:\n\n\u2022 What are the three-dimensional structure and downstream extent of the lunar wake?\nSingle-spacecraft wake observations cannot discern wake asymmetries arising from solar\nwind conditions or from crustal-solar wind interactions; this is due to either lack of pris-\ntine, nearby solar wind information or to lack of multipoint measurements. ARTEMIS\u2019s\ntwo probes will resolve spatio-temporal ambiguities at the wake. The well-instrumented\nprobes will define the wake\u2019s extent and structure as function of downtail distance and\ncharacterize wake asymmetries.\n\n\u2022 What are the plasma acceleration processes and energetics in and around the wake?\nARTEMIS\u2019s comprehensive suite of field and plasma instruments will make possible a\ndetailed study of the plasma physics occurring within the lunar wake that leads to accel-\neration and energization. The study will include the first DC electric field observations\never made in that region, direct observations of non-neutral plasma effects near the wake\nboundary, the extent of secondary electron beams, and their interaction with plasma re-\nfilling of the wake from the flanks.\n\n\u2022 How do wake formation and refilling vary with solar wind and magnetospheric condi-\ntions? The wake structure varies in response to external drivers. Statistical studies provide\ntantalizing hints on how the wake responds to changing or transient solar wind conditions,\nbut incomplete instrumentation and orbital coverage have limited our knowledge of this\nresponse. ARTEMIS will provide an unprecedented wealth of routine observations of the\nwake under a variety of solar wind conditions.\n\n3.2 Planetary Science Objectives\n\nThe ARTEMIS team realized early on that significant benefits to planetary science could\naccrue from the two lunar probes with further, albeit small, orbit and instrument optimiza-\ntions. ARTEMIS can address fundamental problems at the forefront of planetary science at\nthe Moon (Fig. 6): sources and transport of exospheric and sputtered species; charging and\ncirculation of dust by electric fields; structure and composition of the lunar interior by elec-\ntromagnetic (EM) sounding; and surface properties and planetary history, as evidenced in\n\n13 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nV. Angelopoulos\n\nFig. 6 ARTEMIS will study\nwith two identical,\ncross-calibrated spacecraft lunar\nexospheric ions and dust, crustal\nmagnetism, and the lunar interior.\nOne probe will measure the\npristine solar wind driver, while\nthe other will study the lunar\nenvironment\u2019s response.\nARTEMIS extends the\nSELENE/Kaguya results into the\nnext decade, providing synergy\nwith LRO, LADEE, and the\nInternational Lunar Network\n\ncrustal magnetism. Additionally, ARTEMIS\u2019s goals and instrumentation complement LRO\u2019s\nextended phase measurements of the lunar exosphere and of the lunar radiation environment\nby providing high fidelity local solar wind data. ARTEMIS\u2019s electric field and plasma data\nalso support LADEE\u2019s prime goal of understanding exospheric neutral particle and dust par-\nticle generation and transport and will be in place for the deployment of the International\nLunar Network (ILN), providing much needed solar wind information to ILN\u2019s studies of\nlunar deep electromagnetic sounding from the lunar surface.\n\nExosphere and sputtering. From lunar orbit, ARTEMIS will use its charged particle mea-\nsurements obtained by the ESA and SST instruments as an extremely sensitive detection of\nion species produced at the surface or in the exosphere and accelerated by solar wind elec-\ntric fields. Newly created ions, produced by surface sputtering or ionization of exospheric\ngases, are generated at relatively low energies (0.01\u201310 eV), but immediately feel the effect\nof solar wind magnetic and electric fields (which ARTEMIS will also determine). Ions are\nthen accelerated in cycloidal trajectories (i.e., \u201cpicked up\u201d), as demonstrated by the Kaguya\nspacecraft (Nishino et al. 2009). Pickup ions have well-defined orbits, energy and direction\nas function of initial gyrophase; modeling of the observed fluxes can differentiate between\nsurface and exospheric sources (Hartle and Killen 2006).\n\nLunar dust. The lunar surface electric field has been shown to respond closely to solar\nand magnetospheric plasma and energetic particles (Halekas et al. 2007) and also to vary\nwith inclination with respect to the Sun. Electron reflectometry techniques have been used\non Lunar Prospector (LP) to measure the potential drop between LP and the surface poten-\ntial (Halekas et al. 2008a, 2009). The plasma and fields instrumentation on ARTEMIS is\nfar more comprehensive than that flown on previous missions, enabling significant progress\nin our understanding of the origin and dynamics of lunar electric fields: LP measurements\nlacked direct knowledge of the spacecraft potential and ion measurements of any small pos-\nitive potential. Although the LP potential has been modeled, ARTEMIS will be capable of\nactually measuring the spacecraft potential directly because it is equipped with electric field\nand ion analyzer instruments. Thus, ARTEMIS will go beyond the reflectometry measure-\nments of LP with regards and measure a wide range of both positive and negative potentials.\n\nElectromagnetic sounding. EM sounding exploits the fact that eddy currents are gen-\nerated when a conductor is exposed to a changing external magnetic field. The eddy\ncurrents generate their own magnetic field, the induction field, which is readily mea-\nsured by ground or space instruments. The depth to which a signal can penetrate de-\npends on its frequency and the conductivity of the probed material. By using multiple\n\nReprinted from the journal 14\n\n\n\nThe ARTEMIS Mission\n\nfrequencies, electromagnetic sounding has been used to probe the Earth\u2019s upper man-\ntle (see Parkinson 1983; and references therein) and the deep lunar mantle, placing lim-\nits of ?500 km on the radius of the lunar core (Dyal et al. 1974; Russell et al. 1974;\nHood et al. 1982). More recently, EM induction was used to discover liquid water oceans\nin the icy Galilean satellites of Jupiter (Khurana et al. 1998; Kivelson et al. 1999;\nKivelson et al. 2002).\n\nApollo and Lunar Prospector (LP) data have constrained the radius of a highly conducting\nlunar core to <400 km (Hood et al. 1999) and determined the deep mantle conductivity\n(Hood et al. 1982; Hood and Sonnett 1982) and its relation to the geothermal gradient and\nthermal evolution of the Moon. However, the transfer function is not very well constrained at\ndepths less than 500 km from the surface or radial distances less than 500 km from the center,\nbecause at high frequencies the planar approximation breaks down and at low frequencies\nthere are uncertainties in distinguishing the induction signal due to instrument offsets or\nnoise. For example, Explorer 35 data, used to determine the driver in the Apollo era, had\nsignificant offset fluctuations, and the lack of simultaneous plasma measurements prohibited\nidentification and removal of ambient space currents. Lunar Prospector studies did not have\na nearby monitor of the driver signal.\n\nARTEMIS will measure the external, driving magnetic field with one probe and the re-\nsponse of the lunar interior to that field with the other probe when it is near periselene.\nThus, in a manner analogous to planetary flybys (Khurana et al. 1998; Kivelson et al. 2002),\nARTEMIS will determine the response of the conductive core to external field changes.\nAlthough the dipole response will be small (0.2\u20130.8 nT for a driver of dB = 5\u201320 nT),\ndemonstrated offset stability (<0.1 nT/12 h), noise (<5 pT) and digitization (3 pT) on\nARTEMIS/FGM (Auster et al. 2008) enable accurate measurements of the effect. More-\nover, the presence of a nearby probe to measure the ambient field including its small vari-\nations enables, through subtraction from the total\u2014induced plus external\u2014field measured\nat periselene, extremely accurate determination of the induced response. Performing such\nmeasurements dozens of times over the course of the mission, a database of response as\nfunction of position and time relative to the driver impulse, will be assembled, and the core\nsize and conductivity estimated. Differencing the highly sensitive magnetometer signals on\nthe two spacecraft under various external driver frequencies is an ideal way to sound the\ninterior conductivity of the Moon as function of frequency. For the first time the technique\nwill be applied using nearby probes carrying identical sensors with very stable offsets that\ncan be cross-calibrated just hours prior to each pass and can benefit from on-board plasma\nmeasurements to remove local space currents.\n\nThe ARTEMIS periselene altitude will be less than 100 km (exact altitude depends on\nresults of orbit stability analysis optimizing for planetary goals). This altitude is ideal for\nmaking induction measurements from orbit, because with the exception of known, local-\nized magnetic anomalies, all variances from the input signal can be attributed to induction\neffects. The technique can be applied both in the solar wind at the nightside and in the\ntail/magnetosheath/lobes on either side of the terminator.\n\nCrustal magnetism. Crustal magnetism preserves ancient records of planetary and surface\nevolution. At Earth, study of crustal fields revealed polarity reversals of the core dynamo\nand established a chronology that ultimately confirmed the plate tectonics hypothesis. The\norigin of lunar magnetism is less clear because of the absence of a present day dynamo. The\ntwo strongest anomalies on the near side, Reiner Gamma and Descartes, and the strongest\none on the far side, Crisium antipode, have surface fields that likely exceed 1000 nT. Mini-\nmagnetospheric interaction should result in solar wind density enhancements at the front and\n\n15 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nV. Angelopoulos\n\nat the edges of the anomaly, as recently observed by the SELENE/Kaguya ion spectrometer\n(Saito et al. 2010). These anomalies also provide typical examples of the general correlation\nbetween crustal magnetic field regions and high albedo \u201cswirl\u201d features (Richmond et al.\n2003; Nicholas 2007). ARTEMIS will measure lunar fields from 100 km or less, depending\non the periapsis and longitudes that will be attained, at a 10\u00b0 inclination or greater (goal\n? 20\u00b0), depending on the communications link budget and fuel margin available. It will\nstudy the interaction of near-equatorial magnetic anomalies with the solar wind and the\nmagnetotail. These anomalies deflect and shock the solar wind plasma and cause electron\nheating and wave turbulence (Halekas et al. 2008b, 2008c). Even from 100 km altitude and\ninclination below 10\u00b0, the comprehensive instrumentation on ARTEMIS will measure the\nmagnetic properties of Reiner Gamma and the interaction of this mini-magnetosphere with\nthe solar wind and the Earth\u2019s magnetotail.\n\nThus while ARTEMIS cannot improve upon the geographic coverage of the crustal fields\nattained by LP and Apollo, the availability of comprehensive in-situ instrumentation will\ngreatly expand upon the knowledge gained from prior studies of interactions of such anoma-\nlies with the solar wind. For example, ions (including reflected ions) will be measured, the\nwaves from the ion-ion beam instabilities will be sensed in both electric and magnetic fields,\nand the spacecraft potential from the electric field instrument will be helpful in accurately\ndetermining the plasma moments. The high time resolution wave captures will be particu-\nlarly important in the analysis of plasma waves and in further characterization of the mini-\nmagnetosphere interaction with the solar wind.\n\nSynergies with other missions. Because it overlaps with LRO\u2019s extended investigation in\n2011 and 2012, the ARTEMIS mission is in a unique position to support LRO\u2019s prime and\nextended mission science objectives. LRO will study the lunar atmosphere and its variabil-\nity with the LAMP instrument, and particle acceleration mechanisms and their radiation\neffects on tissue with the CRaTER instrument. ARTEMIS can support LAMP observations\nof the exosphere by providing accurate measurements of solar wind and magnetotail drivers.\nObservations during the overlap period between LADEE and ARTEMIS can be used as cal-\nibration points to relate the statistical studies that will be done independently by the two\nmissions. CRaTER\u2019s objective to study Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR) and Solar Energetic\nParticle (SEP) populations will be facilitated by the presence of ARTEMIS as a nearby solar\nwind monitor.\n\nBy measuring both upstream solar wind and local plasma conditions near the Moon,\nARTEMIS is also in a unique position to support the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environ-\nment Explorer (LADEE) mission, slated for a mid-2012 launch. LADEE carries instrumen-\ntation to study the dynamics of the lunar exosphere and dust environment, much of which\nwill be tied directly to the ambient plasma conditions at the Moon and in the solar wind.\nSince LADEE lacks in-situ plasma instrumentation, the presence of ARTEMIS will enable a\nmore direct linkage between specific ambient plasma processes and the resultant exospheric\nvariability measured by LADEE. Moreover, ARTEMIS measurements of the surface poten-\ntial in tandem with LADEE could revolutionize our understanding of charging processes\nrelated to lofted dust that would have gone unnoticed with LADEE measurements alone.\n\nFinally, a major element of NASA\u2019s lunar flight projects is the International Lunar Net-\nwork (ILN), comprised of small geophysical nodes on the lunar surface. These nodes are\nexpected to be deployed in the next decade by NASA and international space agencies. One\nof the goals of the ILN is to perform lunar EM sounding from the surface with both electric\nand magnetic sensors. ARTEMIS in orbit will provide continuous magnetometer measure-\nments of the driver signal to meet the needs of the measurement floor of the ILN network\u2019s\nEM sounding goal.\n\nReprinted from the journal 16\n\n\n\nThe ARTEMIS Mission\n\n4 Mission Design\n\nThe ARTEMIS mission concept originated in 2005, well after the THEMIS Critical Design\nReview, when it was realized that optimizing the prime THEMIS mission orbit design would\nresult in 8 h-long shadows for P1 and P2 (the outermost THEMIS probes), well beyond their\nthermal design limits. Since these would occur about six months after the end of the prime\nmission, alternate plans had to be devised early. Approaches for a mission extended phase\nwere sought in collaboration with NASA/JPL in 2005, when it was realized that by increas-\ning apogee and taking advantage of lunar perturbations, shadows could be avoided with\nminimal resources, about 100 m s?1, although with a complex operations scenario involv-\ning station-keeping in translunar orbits. After a re-design of the THEMIS launch vehicle\ntarget injection in 2006, which re-optimized the fuel margin on the five THEMIS probes,\nit was realized that sufficient margins would be available for P1 and P2 at end-of-mission\nto accommodate a lunar orbit insertion for P1 and P2, assuming a low-thrust injection at\nthe Moon. The lunar orbits had to be highly eccentric, with periods from a few hours to\n1.5 days, because there was insufficient fuel margin to accommodate a low-altitude circu-\nlar orbit. In addition, such orbits were preferred because long periods resulted in infrequent\nshadows and battery cycling, consistent with the thermal design and verification program\nof the THEMIS probes. Additionally, the low thrust capability of the probes required that\nthe Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) maneuver be split in multiple burns, of which the first was\nthe most critical. Thus, residence in the Lagrange points to properly evaluate and adjust the\nLOI conditions was deemed necessary in order to reduce operations risk. Since the probes\nhave axial thrusters thrusting only along (but not opposite to) the spin axis direction, and the\nprobes have spin axis approximately along the ecliptic south, it was realized that lunar polar\norbits would be less advantageous, as they would result in limited orbit control capability.\nFinally, lunar orbits had to avoid Earth and Moon shadows longer than 4 h, a revised re-\nquirement (relative to a 3 h limit at launch) stemming from the operation team\u2019s most recent\nassessment of the thermal design, based on analysis of in-flight performance data.\n\nIn 2007 internal studies at JPL resulted in an initial ARTEMIS trajectory subject to the\nabove constraints that was of sufficient fidelity to be further optimized in collaboration with\nthe science team. In 2008, NASA/HQ requested that the team consider ARTEMIS as part of\nits 2008 Senior Review process (rather than as a separate proposal) and recommended use\nof the Deep Space Network (DSN) for data relay, which enabled consideration of the 34 m\nantennas at a nominal contact frequency of 3.5 h/day. In a series of science working team\nmeetings, the following science considerations were taken in the mission design: (1) The\nLissajous orbits were deemed extremely useful scientifically, because they provide informa-\ntion on tail and solar wind spatial scales never measured before. The science team further\nrequested that the Lissajous orbits be performed as two steps, at least 3-months long each:\nthe LL1, 2 and LL1 step (explained in Sect. 1, in particular with Figs. 2 and 3 and Table 1)\nin order to maximize residence in the large inter-spacecraft separation regime. This was pos-\nsible by inserting P1 at LL2 and P2 at LL1 for 3 months, followed by bringing P1 at LL1 to\nhave both probes on the near-side of the Moon. (2) The differential precession of the line of\napsides of the probes after lunar orbit insertion would be very small if the probes had similar\nlunar orbital elements. This could place restrictions on the insertion times and strategy and\nlimit observation orientations. To avoid such restrictions and to maximize the inter-probe\nseparation vectors, the science team requested that one of the probes be inserted into a retro-\ngrade orbit and the other into a pro-grade orbit to speed up the differential precession of the\nlines of apsides. P1 was selected for retrograde insertion, to help its fuel margin, since retro-\ngrade orbits require less orbit insertion velocity, but this choice may be reconsidered in 2010.\n\n17 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nV.

Higher aposelenes would\nhave caused increased Earth perturbations that would have resulted in early orbit insertion.\nAdditionally, higher aposelenes would have also produced longer lunar shadows (beyond\nthe 4 h limit requirement).\n\nThese science desires and mission operational constraints were worked into the final or-\nbit scenario described in Sect. 1. In particular, the near-equatorial orbits, of period ?1 day\nare easy to achieve with the side-thrusting capability (which allows thrusting at any vector\norientation along the spin plane). Sufficient margin is available at the end of the nominal\nARTEMIS mission design, as shown in Table 3. Since lunar and other perturbations also\nnecessitate correction maneuvers that may be out of the spin plane, care must be taken to\nensure that the return-to-nominal plan of the ARTEMIS operations team is achieved by the\naxial thrusters for reasonable (3 sigma) deviations of the trajectory from nominal. This is\ndone by the ARTEMIS navigation team at GSFC, which analyzes and biases the nominal\norbit such that achievable correction maneuvers can be inserted at specific points into the\nmission, if deemed necessary based on the actual maneuver execution and thruster perfor-\nmance in orbit. The resultant ARTEMIS lunar orbits are very similar, operationally, to the\nones for the THEMIS mission at Earth, in terms of a thermal environment, power cycling,\ncommunications plan, and data collection strategy. These are dictated primarily by the prop-\nerties of the equatorial, highly eccentric, nearly day-long period orbits, resulting in shadows\nthat are below the four-hour flight-demonstrated extended survival limits of the probes dur-\ning their Earth-orbit history. In addition to lunar shadows, care must be taken to predict and\navoid ARTEMIS Earth shadows through mean anomaly phasing; this costs very little fuel if\nachieved far in advance, else it may result in shadows that can exceed the design limit. This\ncombination of science and technical trades has resulted in a robust, low-risk mission design\nsolution for ARTEMIS, and is expected to provide an unprecedented view of the lunar space\nenvironment in a very cost-effective way.\n\nReprinted from the journal 18\n\n\n\nThe ARTEMIS Mission\n\nIn late 2008 it was realized that significant planetary goals can also be achieved from\nARTEMIS, with only small modifications to the mission design. These are a periselene alti-\ntude reduction and an inclination increase. With regards to the periselene altitude, the P1, P2\norbits are expected to be further optimized to \u201cgraze\u201d the surface in the < 100 km domain\nonce a month. By expending maintenance fuel on the order of a few m s?1 (see Table 3 for\na perspective with regards to fuel margins), it is possible to maintain a stable orbit at low\nperiselene. Considerations will be given to the fuel margins prior to orbit insertion and the\noperations complexity from periselene maintenance in the remainder of the mission. With\nregard to inclination adjustments, an inclined orbit results in additional opportunities of con-\njunctions with crustal anomalies near periapsis. But an inclined orbit increases the gravity\ngradient torque on the spin axis away from its optimal orientation of 3\u201313\u00b0 (8\u00b0 nominal).\nThis affects communications as there are significant signal losses below 15\u00b0 from the spin\nplane. Additional considerations include thermal effects, boom shadow effects on instru-\nment performance, and station-keeping fuel. An inclination between 10\u201320\u00b0 is expected to\nbe achievable. The exact value will be determined closer to insertion time. These planetary\nscience optimizations will be revisited in the summer of 2010, after translunar injection, and\nthe results will be folded into the ARTEMIS mission design, assuming sufficient resources\nare available, in early 2011.\n\n5 ARTEMIS Mission Operations Plans\n\nThe ARTEMIS mission is, by design, a natural evolution from THEMIS operations at Earth\nto operations in the lunar environment, in terms of spacecraft commanding and conditioning,\ninstrument modes, instrument operations, and data relay/processing strategy. The ARTEMIS\nMission Operations Systems is comprised of Mission Operations and Science Operations\nfollowing the practices of THEMIS: ARTEMIS is operated by the Mission Operations Cen-\nter (MOC) at the Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley (Bester\net al. 2008). In addition, the JPL mission design team has developed and delivered the mis-\nsion trajectory to the MOC for implementation; the GSFC flight dynamics team has de-\nveloped for ARTEMIS Sun-Sensor\u2014only attitude determination solutions; and the GSFC\nnavigation group supports ARTEMIS in performing navigation error analysis, inserting orbit\nbiases, and determining trajectory correction maneuvers that need to be inserted to compen-\nsate for a return-to-nominal mission design plan. The mission operations center performs:\nmission planning functions in accordance with science (instrument operation modes) re-\nquests; flight dynamics; orbit and attitude determination; maneuver planning; commanding\nand state-of-health monitoring of the five probes; recovery of science and engineering data;\ndata trending and anomaly resolution. Science operations comprise the generation of instru-\nment schedules, data processing and archiving, generation and maintenance of data analysis\nand display software, instrument trending, and science community support.\n\nThe main operations differences between ARTEMIS and THEMIS are: (i) the use of the\nDeep Space Network\u2019s (DSN) 34 m antennas for communications, and (ii) the instrument\noperations that will have to be adjusted to the new environment, reduced data volumes, and\nnew science. Use of the DSN antennas necessitated new operational interfaces (ephemeris,\nscheduling, telemetry/command/tracking data, and file transfers) and processing/conversion\ntools. The integration of the DSN antennas into the existing MOC network is seamless,\nhowever. For example, range and range-rate data from the DSN are transmitted to the MOC,\ntranslated into the same format as the Berkeley Ground Station and the rest of the NASA\nground network, and processed with the standard tools (GTDS) for orbit determination. The\n\n19 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nV. Angelopoulos\n\nTable 4 Typical mode of operations of ARTEMIS probes for Heliophysics and Planetary investigations, per\n2 orbits. An orbit is ?26 h. Bursts will be triggered either based on-board triggers, or based on time. FIT = E,\nB spin fits; MOM = ESA moments; RDFs = reduced particle distributions; FDFs = Full (angular) particle\ndistributions; FBK = filterbank wave spectra; FFFs = Fourier wave spectra\n\nMode Duration Products\n\nSlow Survey 2 orbits FIT, MOM, RDFs, FBK\n\nFast Survey 3 h FDFs, FFFs, Waveforms\n\nPB (2/orbit) 40 min Full cadence FDFs\n\nWB(2 per PB) 2 \u00d7 6 s Full cadence waveforms\n\nmain effect is that given the DSN link margin and contact duration, approximately 1/5 of\nthe amount of data that can be recorded on memory can be transmitted to the ground per\ncontact (nominally once per two days, per probe). (The nominal instrument modes have been\ndiscussed in Angelopoulos (2008).) Because there is one contact per probe over the period of\n2 days, careful planning and selection of the Fast Survey (FS), Particle Burst (PB), and Wave\nBurst (WB) intervals are required (Table 4). The downlink volumes are consistent with one\nFS interval of only ?1.5 h per orbit (compared to 12 h per orbit at Earth) and the selection of\none to two (max) PB per orbit with one or two (max) embedded WBs within it. The location\nof FS is time-based and will be one of the following: wake crossing, periselene, two probe\nwake/boundary alignment, nominal plasma sheet, or boundary layer crossing (magnetotail).\nSince not all of those can be achieved simultaneously, the operations plan involves mission\nphases to optimize data collection for specific science objectives at various parts of the\nmission. Alternative collection plans are also currently being considered.\n\nThe second difference is changes to instruments to best suit the proposed studies in the\nnew environment and commanding of the instrument modes to obtain the optimal helio-\nphysics and planetary science. ARTEMIS cares about instrument sensitivity far beyond the\nrequirements of THEMIS, because it operates in a 10 nT typical ambient field and near-\nbackground particle fluxes, except for the solar wind beam population. With regard to the\nFGM and SCM instruments, cleanup methods have already been devised and disseminated\n(though not very widely used yet). Their operational use and efficacy and any changes in\nresponse to community feedback remain tasks for the future.\n\nFor the FGM instrument these include corrections to: ground processing of data around\nrange changes, digital-to-analog differential non-linearity effects, offset drifts, and power\nsystem currents. Since it is anticipated that the magnetometer will be in a single range (likely\nrange 8, ?3 pT resolution, ?100 nT maximum field, see Auster et al. 2008), and the non-\nlinearity affects the data in high fields only, by far the most important corrections necessary\nin the lunar phase are the offset drift correction and the power system current noise removal.\nRoutine offset determination using recently developed techniques in the solar wind (Leinwe-\nber et al. 2008) and calibration of L2 data to account for power system currents will be done\nby the science team in the operational phase of ARTEMIS. For the ESA instrument (McFad-\nden et al. 2008a, 2008b), the solar wind mode routinely used on THEMIS is incompatible\nwith the need to measure simultaneously the upstream ions, wake-accelerated or solar wind\nshock-accelerated ions, or lunar backscattered ions. The current plan is therefore to utilize\nthe electron sensor for determining solar wind velocity, density, and electron temperature\nand ignore the ion saturation that occurs from the nominal magnetospheric mode operation\nof the ion sensor. The inter-calibration of ESA electron density and velocity with the other\ninstruments (electric field, ion ESA) is currently under way. An alternative approach is to\n\nReprinted from the journal 20\n\n\n\nThe ARTEMIS Mission\n\ncreate a hybrid instrument operational mode with higher angle resolution in the solar wind\ndirection, preserving the full energy resolution achievable in the magnetospheric mode. This\napproach will enable solar wind ion density and velocity measurements and provide reason-\nable total ion temperature measurements, as well.\n\nAdditional effects from shadows on all instruments are present. In the absence of a sun-\npulse the spin period is not known internally on the spacecraft, and particle instrument sec-\ntoring of distribution functions and on-board spin-fits of the magnetic and electric field data\nbecome suspect. As the spin period changes due to thermal effects (wire boom contraction\ncauses probe to spin up), the above sectoring and spin-fit algorithm results in products with\nan apparent drift in sun-angle. The drift can result in several full rotations per hour, but since\nthe spinup is a combination of several non-linear terms (as it depends on amount of partial\nsun illumination, wire/probe bus heat capacity, and moment of inertia), it can only be fitted\nto observed data. This has been done with good success using the FGM data, and routines for\ncorrecting the shadow data are now available. The spin-phase information will be included\nas a correction to the spin-phase files in the post-processing tools for all particles and fields\nquantities to produce accurately post-processed distributions and properly oriented spin-fits.\n\nScience data processing, calibration, dissemination, and analysis tools development and\nmaintenance follow the successful practices of THEMIS. Level-0 data are uncalibrated raw\ndata, in day-file and raw packet format. Level-1 data are Common Data Format (CDF) files\ncontaining uncompressed, time-ordered, overlap-deleted data in raw instrument units (e.g.,\ncounts, 16 bit integers). They are efficiently packaged, and can be read by any platform\nthat supports the NASA/GSFC-distributed CDF platform. L1 files are read automatically by\nIDL-based, freely and widely distributed analysis tools and are calibrated on-the-fly using\nthe latest calibration parameters to take advantage of the most updated calibration done on\nthe instrument without the need for any L1 file reprocessing. L2 files contain calibrated data\nof a subset of the dataset, representing the most important quantities from each instrument.\nL2 files are in physical units and also in CDF format and do not require further calibration;\nthey can be read by any software that is able to access CDF files, such as Fortran, C, Matlab,\nand IDL. They are simple enough to be easily interpreted using standard documentation.\nAutomated processing performs both standard calibration (using the latest parameters and\norbit-predicts) and L2 file production within hours of data receipt at the MOC. Standard\noverview plots are also automatically produced to facilitate data quality evaluation and quick\nevent selection, especially in conjunction with other missions. An example of an overview\nplot is shown in Fig. 7. Events such as calibration file changes or definitive orbit/attitude file\nupdates trigger reprocessing of both L2 files and on-line plots.\n\nFiles are disseminated via project site and mirror site web pages by NASA/GSFC\u2019s Space\nPhysics Data Facility and by Virtual Observatories. Plans for inclusion of ARTEMIS data\ninto the Planetary Data System (PDS) are currently under way. The most useful and more\nprevailing means of data dissemination, however, is via the THEMIS and ARTEMIS data\nanalysis software, an IDL-based suite of reading, analysis, and visualization routines of-\nfering both command-line and Graphical User Interface capability. This code, used by the\nscience team, is freely available to the science community. Data ingestion is performed \u201con-\nthe-fly\u201d, along with calibration, if L1 quantities are being introduced. The code interrogates\nthe user\u2019s preferred http or ftp sites (the default is project site) and downloads only the data\nthat has been reprocessed recently, based on the file creation date at the user\u2019s machine rel-\native to the remote site. Batch downloads or bundled downloads are also possible but not\nrequired or needed. Once the data resides on a user\u2019s machine, analysis is possible off-line.\nDozens of crib sheets, i.e., text files containing IDL code that demonstrates usage of cer-\ntain routines, are available with the data distribution. Special-purpose crib sheets are also\n\n21 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nV.

Angelopoulos\n\n6 Summary\n\nARTEMIS, the first two micro-satellite mission to the Moon, is a cost-effective inter-\ndisciplinary mission addressing fundamental questions in NASA\u2019s Heliophysics and Plan-\netary Disciplines. ARTEMIS will study space physics processes in the solar wind, mag-\nnetotail, and the lunar wake, and can also address important questions on the exospheric,\nsurface, and subsurface lunar environment. With stable orbits, ARTEMIS can monitor both\nthe solar wind and the lunar environment during the next solar cycle; it is therefore aligned\nwith NAC/NRC\u2019s recommendations to characterize the lunar environment and predict space\nweather impacts on robotic and human productivity. Finally, being the first mission to use\nprolonged residence in lunar libration orbits, which are important for communications and\nas staging grounds for lunar landings, ARTEMIS represents a pathfinder for future lunar\nexploration missions.\n\nAcknowledgements ARTEMIS was made possible thanks to the excellence of the implementing teams\nand the tenacity of the many scientists \u201cover the Moon\u201d at the expectation of its scientific returns. The project\nis blossoming into both an exploratory mission of and from the lunar environment, and a dependable, long\nterm node of the Heliophysics Observatory. Dr. D. Sibeck was instrumental in the early mission design and\na constant source of encouragement; he organized the science deliberations that produced the first distilled,\npragmatic, yet exciting scientific outline of the mission plan. Heartfelt thanks to Drs. D. Brain, G. Delory,\nJ. Eastwood, W. Farrell, R. Grimm, J. Halekas, H. Hasegawa, K. Khurana, D. Krauss-Varban, R. Lillis,\nM. Oieroset, T. Phan, J. Raeder, C. Russell, P. Travnicek, J. Weygand, D. Schriver, and J. Slavin, who helped\ndefine a focused and highly optimized scientific investigation, and to Drs. H. Spence, N. Fox, P. Brandt,\nM. Collier, and D. Rowland for their careful review and constructive criticism of the concept while still in its\ninfancy; the discipline owes you for your gracious contribution of your time. The JPL mission design team\nwas creative and patient with the scientists\u2019 requests; in particular, S. Broschard, M. K. Chung, S. Hatch, J.\nMa, T. Sweetser, and G. Whiffen did a fantastic job that has stood the test of reviews and time\u2014they are the\nfirst of the team to claim \u201cvictory\u201d. Many thanks to the GSFC navigation team, D. Folta, M. Woodard, and D.\nWoodfork, for validating the \u201creturn-to-nominal\u201d concept is achievable with less-than-3D thrust capability,\nfor building up the navigation error and maneuver correction plan, and for their continued support with\ntrajectory optimizations and maneuver execution in the translunar and Lissajous phases. Thanks also go to\nJ. Hashmall, D. Felikson, and J. Sedlak for developing the Sun-only attitude solutions that enabled ARTEMIS\nto find its way without a compass. I owe my deepest gratitude to the ARTEMIS Mission Operations Team\nat UC Berkeley for having operated the two ARTEMIS probes flawlessly, conserving fuel margin despite the\n2nd year THEMIS science re-optimization. The team, led by Dr. M. Bester, is comprised of M. Lewis, S. Frey,\nD. Cosgrove, B. Roberts, J. McDonald, D. Pease, J. Thorsness, J. Marchese, B. Owens, S. Gandhi, M. Eckert,\nR. Dumlao, G. Lemieux, G. Picard, S. Johnson, and T. Clemons. They are the quiet heroes behind the many\ndiscoveries sure to come. After turning every last drop of hydrazine available on THEMIS margin into new\ncapabilities for ARTEMIS, they rolled up their sleeves and got to work on a challenge even more ambitious\nthan simultaneous maneuvering of five spacecraft with a combined 100 maneuvers per year (who would have\nimagined there could have been one?). Their careful post-maneuver data analyses, which lead to a thruster\nperformance prediction model, have substantially reduced operations risk, providing us a safer ride to the final\nARTEMIS destination. A great many thanks go to the spacecraft provider, ATK Space (formerly SWALES\nAerospace Inc.), for a well-behaved set of probes; and to an experienced and committed instrument team\nfor building, calibrating, and maintaining five impeccable sets of instruments\u2014they have made operations\neasier and enabled the full panoply of THEMIS to be deployed in a new journey of exploration and discovery.\nARTEMIS was made possible by NASA under contract NAS5-02099.\n\nReferences\n\nM.H.

By mission\ndesign and both efficient navigation and flight operations during the primary phase of the\nTHEMIS mission from February 2007 to September 2009 (Angelopoulos 2008), the out-\nermost two THEMIS spacecraft P1 and P2 found themselves with fuel reserves sufficient\nto undertake a series of over forty maneuvers, including multiple lunar approaches and fly-\nbys, that enabled them to reach and parallel the Moon during trans-lunar injection phases\nfrom October 2009 through September 2010. From October 2010 to January 2011, the two\nspacecraft were in Lissajous orbits at the Lagrange points of the Earth-Moon system that\nstraddled the Moon and were separated by distances on the order of ?20 Earth radii (RE).\nFrom January to July 2011, their Lissajous orbits were separated by 5 to 20 RE on the same\nside of the Moon. In July 2011 they entered lunar orbits (one prograde, the other retrograde)\nwith separation distances ranging from 500 km to 20 lunar radii (RL). Note that 1 RE is\n6371 km, while 1 RL is 1737 km.\n\nObservations from lunar orbit over a such wide range of interspacecraft separations are\nideal for addressing a number of longstanding heliophysics objectives, including defining\nthe characteristics of reconnection and turbulence in the solar wind and distant magnetotail,\nthe nature of particle acceleration at the Earth\u2019s bow shock and interplanetary discontinu-\nities, and the electrodynamics of the solar wind\u2019s interaction with the Moon. However, by\ncareful optimization of mission parameters, in particular periselene and orbital inclination,\nthe fully-instrumented and fully-functional ARTEMIS spacecraft can also be employed to\naddress a set of planetary research objectives including the composition and magnetization\nof the lunar surface, the effects of electric fields on dust in the vicinity of the Moon, and\nthe structure of the lunar interior. With orbits that will remain stable for over a decade,\nARTEMIS will provide observations of the lunar environment over solar cycle time scales,\noffer measurements that overlap and enhance those of NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Or-\nbiter (LRO) and Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) missions, and\nprovide crucial solar wind observations for correlative studies with other NASA missions to\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetosphere and ionosphere/thermosphere.\n\nAngelopoulos (2011, this issue) provides a mission overview for ARTEMIS that summa-\nrizes the overall scientific objectives, orbits, instrumentation, mission and science operations\nthat are expanded upon in individual papers in this compendium. This paper describes how\nthe above mission elements will enable the ARTEMIS team to reach scientific closure. In\nterms of organization, Sect. 2 describes ARTEMIS planetary objectives while Sect. 3 de-\nscribes the ARTEMIS heliophysics objectives. Section 4 presents conclusions.\n\nReprinted from the journal 28\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\n2 ARTEMIS Planetary Science Objectives\n\nThe Moon holds critical information regarding the origin of the solar system. Because it is\ndevoid of plate tectonics, volcanism and surface-altering atmospheric processes, the Moon\u2019s\nsurface has recorded the 4.5 billion years of solar system history more purely than any other\nplanetary body. Understanding the lunar surface and the stratification of the lunar interior\nprovides a window into the early history of the Earth-Moon system and can shed consider-\nable light on the evolution of terrestrial planets such as Mars and Venus. The surface is con-\nstantly sputtering ions and dust, which then enter and circulate within the lunar exosphere\nbefore escaping into the solar wind. Ions \u2018picked-up\u2019 by the solar wind gain similar veloc-\nities but mass-dependent energies as they follow mass-dependent trajectories. ARTEMIS\nwill use its energy-angle spectroscopic capability and its electric and magnetic field sen-\nsors to determine the motion, source, composition, and flux of exospheric ions. The surface\nelectric fields that loft and transport dust particles can be remotely sensed using electron re-\nflectometry or measured directly from altitude. ARTEMIS will use its electromagnetic field\nmeasurements to determine the forces acting on dust populations and cause their accelera-\ntion and deposition or loss in the lunar environment.\n\nApollo-era data indicates that the Moon formed via the impact of a Mars-sized object\nwith the early Earth, and later differentiated into primary crust, mantle residuum, and pos-\nsibly a small iron-rich core. Radial profiles for the Moon\u2019s temperature and composition,\nand their lateral variability today, hold important clues regarding the history of lunar dif-\nferentiation. Broadband (?10 mHz to 10 Hz) electromagnetic sounding will improve our\nknowledge of these state variables for the core, mantle, and crust. The sensitive magnetome-\nters on ARTEMIS will approach the Moon on orbits that bring them, one at a time, to within\n100 km of the lunar surface, i.e. to altitudes close enough to detect the core response to\nvarying external drivers but distant enough to minimize perturbations from crustal anoma-\nlies. ARTEMIS also provides sensitive horizontal electric field measurements from 1\u201310 Hz\nthat will further enable magnetotelluric investigations.\n\nFinally, ARTEMIS will use its comprehensive particle and field sensors to study the inter-\naction of the solar wind with lunar crustal magnetic anomalies. Initial Kaguya observations\nhave already provided significant new information on an ion sheath, electron heating and\nsolar wind reflection around magnetic anomalies at 100 km (Saito et al. 2010), but wave\nproperties and solar wind particle flow around the strong field region remain poorly under-\nstood. ARTEMIS will study the magnetic anomalies to infer properties of the ancient, seed\nmagnetic field and to determine the accessibility of the solar wind to the surface and the ef-\nfect it has on lunar surface ageing. Electric field and plasma wave data, together with ion and\nelectron measurements in the vicinity of the mini-magnetosphere and shock-like structures\n(e.g., Halekas et al. 2006a) that form around the crustal anomaly (the first comprehensive\nplasma measurements attempted at the Moon) promise exciting new science with possibly\nsignificant ramifications for planetary evolution.\n\n2.1 Exospheric Ions and Plasma Pick-up\n\nForty years after the first Apollo landings, the composition and structure of the lunar exo-\nsphere remain poorly understood. A number of studies have used ground-based measure-\nments to investigate the existence, extent, variability and likely sources of easily observed\nexospheric species such as sodium and potassium (Potter and Morgan 1988; Tyler et al.\n1988; Mendillo et al. 1991, 1999; Wilson et al. 2003, 2006). However, the behavior of these\nspecies may not be representative of other, more abundant, species (Potter and Morgan 1988;\nFlynn and Mendillo 1993).\n\n29 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nFig. 1 A schematic showing the trajectories of recently picked-up ions and the expected measurements of\nthe fluxes (top left) and composition (top right) of the picked-up ions\n\nIn situ measurements of pickup ions offer an appealing complementary means of probing\nsurface and exospheric properties and processes at the Moon (e.g. Hartle and Thomas 1974;\nCladis et al. 1994; Yokota and Saito 2005; Hartle and Killen 2006; Hartle and Sittler 2007;\nSaito et al. 2010). Newly created ions, produced by solar wind sputtering, photostimulated\ndesorption, micro-meteoriod impact vaporization or ionization of exospheric gases are gen-\nerated at relatively low energies (0.01\u201310 eV), but immediately feel the effect of solar wind\nmagnetic and electric field (Stern 1999; Wurtz et al. 2007). The \u2018picked-up\u2019 ions are then\naccelerated in cycloidal trajectories like that shown in Fig. 1.\n\nIn situ measurements by ion instruments on the space plasma missions AMPTE, WIND,\nand GEOTAIL confirmed the presence of lunar heavy ions far downstream from the Moon\nin the solar wind and in the distant magnetotail (Hilchenbach et al. 1991, 1993; Kirsch\net al. 1997; Mall et al. 1998), but relied on fortuitous configurations of the solar wind and\n\nReprinted from the journal 30\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nIMF and were not able to provide comprehensive information on exospheric composition,\nsource rates, or variability. Further, these studies could not distinguish between lunar ions\noriginating at the surface and those created in the exosphere.\n\nMore recent studies have shown that it is possible to separate the signatures of surface and\nexospheric ions, using measurements made at altitudes smaller than the typical gyroradius\nof newly ionized lunar species. For example, the upper left inset in Fig. 1 shows the result\nof a computation by Yokota and Saito (2005) of the expected differential fluxes of Na at\n?100 km altitudes resulting from both surface sputtering and exospheric photoionization.\nThe surface ions are nearly monoenergetic, while the atmospheric ions spread out in energy\ndue to the extended source and low observation altitude. At higher altitudes, the ions would\nbe accelerated still further, resulting in a much more monoenergetic spectrum and much\nhigher ion energies for both surface and exospheric sources (with little reduction in flux\nunless significant scattering occurs in one ion gyroperiod). At distances within two gyroradii\nfrom the source, one may discriminate between ions with different masses by comparing\nobserved energies and gyrophases with those predicted for the cyclical motion shown in\nFig. 1, though distinguishing between surface and exospheric ions becomes more difficult.\n\nKaguya findings have recently advanced our understanding of the solar wind\u2019s interaction\nwith the lunar surface as well as the near-Moon wake. Kaguya\u2019s in situ ion mass spectrome-\ntry was used to confirm the presence of Na+ in addition to He+, C+, O+, K+, and Ar+ in the\nsunlit lunar exosphere at altitudes ?100 km when the Moon was in the solar wind (Yokota\net al. 2009) and Earth\u2019s magnetosphere (Tanaka et al. 2009). Some ions originated from the\nexosphere, others from the surface. Other species may be present as well. The heavy ion flux\nvaries with solar zenith angle but not with solar wind flux or meteor shower occurrences,\nsuggesting a stable driver for the sputtering process.\n\nKaguya observations also indicate that from 0.1 to 1% of the solar wind protons incident\nupon the Moon are reflected. Solar wind convection electric fields accelerate some of these\nprotons to speeds triple those of the solar wind (Saito et al. 2008). The pickup ions find\naccess not only to the high latitude wake, but also areas deep within the low latitude and\nlow altitude wake through fully kinetic processes. Knowledge of the solar wind electric and\nmagnetic fields suffices to reconstruct observed proton spectra from dayside reflected proton\nsources.\n\nThe ESA and SST instruments on ARTEMIS will measure the energy and direction of\npickup ion particle distributions, while the EFI and FGM instruments will measure the ambi-\nent electric and magnetic fields. With this information, researchers will be able to backtrack\nobserved pickup ions to either surface or exospheric sources. Furthermore, they will be able\nto roughly determine the ion mass, since both the ion energy and the size of the cycloidal tra-\njectories scale with mass. ARTEMIS can therefore use pickup ion measurements to remotely\nprobe the properties of the surface and the exosphere. Measurements from the ARTEMIS\nprobe measuring the lunar exosphere can then be combined with observations from the other\nARTEMIS probe to determine the response of the exosphere to solar wind drivers.\n\nAlthough ARTEMIS will generally be further away from the Moon than Kaguya, the\nlarge geometric factor of the ESA total ion instruments (a factor of ?10 greater than those\non Kaguya) will enable sensitive measurements of the pickup ions under stable solar wind\nconditions over distances ranging from 100 km to several thousand km from the lunar sur-\nface. When applied as a function of lunar phase the technique will determine the dependence\nof the lunar exosphere on lunar longitude undergoing illumination, thereby providing the ion\ncomposition versus selenographic longitude. Since the pickup ion trajectories measured by\nARTEMIS can be back-traced, the latitudinal exospheric ion distribution can also be deter-\nmined.\n\n31 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nA second method of indirect detection of lunar ions may also be possible using\nARTEMIS measurements. Pickup ions form ring distributions that can generate electro-\nmagnetic ion cyclotron waves. It may be possible to detect these waves using the ARTEMIS\nvector magnetic field data. Waves from pickup ions have been identified in the plasma en-\nvironments of many solar system bodies, including Venus, Mars, and even the moons of the\ngiant planets (Russell et al. 1990; Kivelson et al. 1996; Paterson et al. 1999; Grebowsky et al.\n2004; Dougherty et al. 2006; Russell and Blanco-Cano 2007; Delva et al. 2008), and their\npresence or absence can be used to constrain the local density of pickup ions, and therefore\nthe source strength.\n\nFinally, synergistic measurements made by ARTEMIS and other orbiting spacecraft can\nbe used to constrain exospheric properties. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mis-\nsion carries the Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) ultraviolet instrument (Gladstone\net al. 2010), while the upcoming Lunar Atmosphere Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE)\nmission carries the NMS for neutral mass spectrometry and the UVS ultraviolet/visual spec-\ntrometer (Delory et al. 2009). These missions thus measure gases before ionization, while\nARTEMIS measures them post-ionization. By coordinating ARTEMIS measurements with\nthose from these and other spacecraft, we can greatly advance our understanding of the lunar\nexosphere and its coupling to the surface and the space environment.\n\n2.2 Surface Charging, Electric Fields, and Dust\n\nAlthough one might think of the lunar environment as essentially dormant, it is in fact very\nactive electrically. Since the Moon has only a tenuous exosphere and no global magnetic\nfield, its surface lies directly exposed to the impact of solar UV and X-rays as well as solar\nwind plasma and energetic particles. This creates a complex and dynamic lunar electric en-\nvironment, with the surface typically charging positive in sunlight and negative in shadow\nto potentials that vary over orders of magnitude in response to changing solar illumination\nand plasma conditions. These potentials have been measured by instruments on the surface\nand by Lunar Prospector in orbit, but we still do not fully understand the near-surface envi-\nronment, especially the role of secondary and photoemitted electrons, and the structure of\nthe plasma sheath at the surface.\n\nThe largest observed lunar potentials typically occur on the nightside, in the absence\nof photoemission, where ambient plasma currents primarily drive surface charging (Manka\n1973; Stubbs et al. 2007). Using measurements of the angular distribution of reflected elec-\ntrons and accelerated secondary electrons from the surface, Lunar Prospector provided es-\ntimates of negative nightside lunar surface potentials of ??100 V or less in the wake\nand magnetospheric tail lobes (Halekas et al. 2002a, 2008c), and occasionally as high as\n?2\u20134 kV in the magnetospheric plasmasheet (Halekas et al. 2005, 2008c) and during SEP\nevents (Halekas et al. 2007). However, all Lunar Prospector measurements were fundamen-\ntally handicapped by a lack of spacecraft potential measurements and the spectrometer\u2019s\nrather coarse electron energy resolution. ARTEMIS\u2019s high resolution full plasma and elec-\ntric field measurements will enable researchers to measure lunar surface potentials from or-\nbit accurately and precisely, as well as determine their response to external influences. The\nexcellent energy resolution of the electron spectrometers on ARTEMIS will also enable a\nbetter understanding of the importance of lunar photoelectrons and secondary electrons, and\nmay allow us to determine whether the potential in the plasma sheath varies monotonically,\nor non-monotonically as suggested by recent simulations (Poppe and Horanyi 2010).\n\nNear-surface electric fields like those described above can loft micron-sized charged dust\ngrains (Nitter et al. 1998). The horizon \u2018glow\u2019 observed by cameras on the landed Surveyors\n\nReprinted from the journal 32\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\n5, 6 and 7 at lunar twilight was attributed to sunlight scattering by dust electrostatically-\nlevitated just above the lunar surface by electric fields at the terminators (Criswell 1973;\nRennilson and Criswell 1974). Astronauts in Apollo\u2019s command module also witnessed\na twilight horizon glow extending 10\u2019s of kilometers above the lunar surface which was\nsuggested to result from surface ejection of submicron grains to high altitudes (McCoy and\nCriswell 1974; McCoy 1976). Lunar Prospector has confirmed the presence of strong and\ndynamic near-surface electric fields that are capable of lofting small charged grains to high\naltitudes (10\u2019s of km) in a dust \u2018fountain\u2019 effect (Stubbs et al. 2006). These near surface\nelectric fields may be strongest at the terminator\u2014the starting location of the lunar wake\n(Farrell et al. 2007).\n\nThe nature of the wake plasma discontinuity at the terminator remains unknown. Ide-\nally, there should be a \u2018perfect\u2019 plasma discontinuity at the terminator dividing flowing solar\nwind plasma from a perfect plasma void. Due to their higher thermal velocities, electrons\nshould migrate into the plasma void further than ions, thereby creating a very large ambipo-\nlar E-field just above the lunar surface. This initial plasma expansion E-field could drive\ndust transport at the terminator (Farrell et al. 2007). However, plasma discontinuities tend to\ndissipate by radiating plasma waves at group velocities that exceed the speed of the discon-\ntinuity. These oscillatory waves and their related ULF/VLF electric fields may diminish the\nambipolar effect and associated dust lofting.\n\nARTEMIS will examine the wake flank/discontinuity as a function of distance from the\nterminator, providing enough passes under varying solar wind and IMF directions to provide\na unique evaluation of the effectiveness of the ambipolar forces in surface dust lofting. In\nessence, ARTEMIS will cross the discontinuity at various stages of its evolution, providing\ndetailed observations of the plasma expansion and discontinuity dissipation processes. For\nsimilar solar wind and IMF configurations, the wake flank can be considered time stationary,\nand passages through the flank at various altitudes are equivalent to examining the disconti-\nnuity dissipation process as a function of time. The initial plasma expansion process is not\nonly fundamentally new science, but also crucial to understanding surface dust lofting from\nE-fields at the terminator.\n\n2.3 Internal Structure\n\nElectromagnetic sounding encompasses a wide variety of inductive methods used to sense\nthe interior of the Earth, the Moon and other planetary bodies (Schuster and Lamb 1889;\nGrant and West 1965; Sonett 1982; Khurana et al. 1998; Simpson and Bahr 2005). Suit-\nable signals for planetary-scale soundings arise from the solar wind, magnetospheres, iono-\nspheres, and lightning, depending on the planetary environment (Grimm 2009). These time-\nvarying electromagnetic source fields induce eddy currents in planetary interiors, whose\nsecondary electromagnetic fields are detected at the surface. The secondary fields shield the\ninterior according to the skin-depth effect, which is exploited by electromagnetic sounding\nby using impedance measurements over a range of frequency to reconstruct conductivity\nover a range of depth.\n\nElectromagnetic induction studies performed during Apollo gave an indication of the\ndeep electrical conductivity profile and limited the radius of any strongly conducting core\nto less than about 20% of the lunar radius (e.g, Sonett et al. 1972; Dyal et al. 1974; Hood\net al. 1982; Hood and Sonett 1982). Laboratory conductivity-temperature measurements\nwere used to translate the lunar conductivity profile to a selenotherm that is roughly equiv-\nalent with the background, global heat flow derived by Wieczorek et al. (2006). The outer\n500 km was poorly constrained due to the limited magnetometer bandwidth (higher frequen-\ncies are needed to resolve shallower depths).\n\n33 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nFig. 2 The ARTEMIS\nspacecraft probe the lunar\ninterior individually by the\nmagnetotelluric method and\njointly using the magnetic\ntransfer function method. The\ninvestigation will provide\nconstraints on core size, on the\ncomposition of the lower mantle,\nand on the nature of\nupper-mantle heterogeneity,\nparticularly the anomalous\nProcellarum KREEP Terrane\n\nIn spite of these advances, significant questions remain. The International Lunar Network\nScience Definition Team Report (1998) identified three new investigations for electromag-\nnetic sounding: (1) determine the structure of the outer 500 km (upper mantle and crust) that\nmay contain key information on early lunar evolution, specifically, the extent of the magma\nocean and the origin of major provinces; (2) provide tighter bounds on the conductivity of\nthe lower mantle (500\u20131400 km depth), that may constrain trace amounts of H2O (Saal et al.\n2008; Grimm and McSween 2009); and (3) determine whether the Moon has a core, and is\nit metal or molten silicate.\n\nThe fundamental quantity that must be measured in any induction experiment is the fre-\nquency dependent electromagnetic impedance Z. The most important constraint is that two\nknown quantities are always necessary (Grimm 2009), e.g., Ohm\u2019s Law Z = V/I . Apollo-\nera lunar studies used the distantly-orbiting Explorer 35 to determine the source magnetic\nfield, and compared this to Apollo 12 surface measurements that represent the sum of source\nand induced fields. This is the Transfer-Function technique (see Fig. 2). Alternatively the\nMagnetotelluric Method can provide a complete sounding from individual platforms us-\ning orthogonal horizontal components of the electric and magnetic fields (e.g., Vozoff 1991;\nSimpson and Bahr 2005; Grimm and Delory 2008). The plane-wave impedances determined\nby the Magnetotelluric Method are extendable to spherical geometry when skin depths be-\ncome comparable to the planetary radius (Weidelt 1972; see also Schubert and Schwartz\n1972).\n\nWith these considerations, we have defined an electromagnetic sounding investigation\nfor ARTEMIS. Transfer Function soundings can be performed when the Moon is in the\nEarth\u2019s magnetotail, both probes are in daylight, one probe is near periapsis (?100 km),\nand the other at least several lunar radii away (including up to apoapsis ?19,000 km). This\nensures that the distant probe measures only the primary field while the periapsis probe\nmeasures the sum of the primary and secondary fields. Only the fluxgate magnetometers are\nnecessary. This geometry contrasts with the free-solar-wind environment used for Apollo\nTransfer Function soundings. Here, the dayside confining plasma layer would have required\nthe second measurement (primary+secondary field) to be made at or near the surface, well\nbelow the ARTEMIS periapsis altitude. Measurements with both spacecraft in the wake are\nalso possible, although it may be more difficult to separate the relevant signals in the hot\ntenuous plasma in this shadowed region, where spacecraft charging may reach extremes.\n\nThe probe periapses of 100 km restrict the minimum investigation depth to a few hun-\ndred km or greater. They may glimpse some upper mantle structure but will certainly probe\nthe lower mantle, especially given that measurements may be made during some tens of\nminutes around periapsis. Close study of field-line deflection over many periapses passages\nmay be used to detect the core (Russell et al. 1982; Hood et al. 1999).\n\nReprinted from the journal 34\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nARTEMIS will conduct the first extraterrestrial tests of the Magnetotelluric Method, us-\ning both electric (EFI) and magnetic (FGM) records during periapsis passages. While these\nmeasurements may be possible under a variety of conditions and geometries, they are likely\nbest conducted in sunlight while in the magnetotail. As these are the same conditions favor-\ning Transfer Function soundings, results should be identical: discrepancies will highlight the\nkinds of data processing and/or auxiliary information needed to extract the electromagnetic\npart of the electric-field.\n\nWith its 1.5-yr mission at low periapses, ARTEMIS will have both data redundancy\n(signal integration) and geographic coverage around the equator. The ARTEMIS mission\nwill advance our understanding of the deep lunar interior and provide a baseline for next-\ngeneration lunar and planetary electromagnetic sounding.\n\n2.4 Magnetic Anomaly Interactions\n\nMaps for lunar crustal magnetic fields remain significantly undersampled and the causes of\nlunar crustal magnetization remain uncertain. Local enhancements in the crustal magnetic\nfield can shield the lunar surface from space weathering caused by ion sputtering and gen-\nerate mini-magnetospheres whose effects can be felt far from the lunar surface. ARTEMIS\nwill provide the combination of in situ and remote observations needed to substantially im-\nprove our global picture of crustal magnetism and then determine its effects on its immediate\nenvironment.\n\n2.4.1 Causes of Crustal Anomalies\n\nPatterns of crustal magnetization preserve a record of planetary evolution. Thermoremanent\nmagnetization in the presence of a dynamo magnetic field is the dominant process by which\nthe terrestrial crust has been magnetized, as is likely the case for Mars (Connerney et al.\n1999). Alternating \u2018stripes\u2019 of magnetized seafloor crust at mid-ocean ridges were crucial\nin confirming geodynamo polarity reversals and the plate tectonics hypothesis (Vine and\nMatthews 1963; Vine and Wilson 1965). The origin(s) of lunar magnetism are far less cer-\ntain: lunar sample measurements indicate the possible existence of a lunar dynamo from\n3.6\u20133.9 billion years ago (Cisowski et al. 1983) with an order of magnitude decrease before\nand after that period.\n\nThere are many hypotheses for the source of the ambient field and the magnetization pro-\ncess. Steady magnetizing fields of both external (solar or terrestrial) and internal (lunar dy-\nnamo) origin have been proposed, as have transient fields generated by impacts (for reviews,\nsee Fuller 1974, and Wieczorek et al. 2006). Thermoremanent magnetization is likely the\ndominant process for igneous lunar samples; however, shock remanent magnetization may\nbe significant in lightly metamorphosed breccias, which carry the strongest and most stable\nremanent magnetization of all lunar samples because they contain more metallic iron grains\n(likely produced by meteoritic impacts) (Fuller et al. 1974; Fuller and Cisowski 1987). Mare\nbasalts, on the other hand, contain less nanophase iron and generally have weaker remanent\nmagnetization (Coleman et al. 1972).\n\nWith samples from only a handful of lunar landing sites, orbital magnetic measure-\nments have been relied upon to study the global pattern of crustal magnetism. Two types\nof data have been used: magnetometer and electron reflection measurements. Magnetome-\nter data provide vector information but are limited by spacecraft altitude and the fact that\nlunar crustal magnetic fields at satellite altitudes are typically very weak: ?2 and ?3 or-\nders of magnitude weaker than the terrestrial and Martian cases respectively (Connerney\n\n35 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\net al. 2004). Electron reflection measurements invoke magnetic mirroring and use magne-\ntometer observations together with electron energy and angular distributions measured from\norbit to estimate the magnetic field magnitude at the lunar surface (Anderson et al. 1975;\nLin et al. 1976). Electron reflection data have the virtue of being particularly sensitive to the\nweakest crustal fields (Halekas 2003; Mitchell et al. 2008).\n\nElectron reflection and magnetometer measurements from the Apollo 15 and 16 sub-\nsatellites (Hood et al. 1981; Lin et al. 1988) and the Lunar Prospector spacecraft (Hood et al.\n2001; Halekas et al. 2001; Mitchell et al. 2008) have enabled global mapping of lunar crustal\nfields. However, the map is severely undersampled, with significant noise and pixelization\nclearly visible (see Fig. 3), accounting for much uncertainty in geophysical interpretation.\nARTEMIS ESA, with better energy resolution than Lunar Prospector or Apollo, will, along\nwith ARTEMIS magnetometer measurements, enable more accurate correction for the ef-\nfects of electrostatic potentials between the lunar surface and the spacecraft (Halekas et al.\n2002b; Mitchell et al. 2008) and therefore provide more accurate crustal field estimates. The\ntwo ARTEMIS probes will make many hundreds of low altitude (<400 km) electron reflec-\ntion measurements within 10? (20? if optimized) of the equator on every periselene pass,\nresulting in better spatial coverage and higher fidelity crustal field maps in these regions\nthan currently exist.\n\nExisting maps show weaker fields over the mare basalts compared with the highlands (in\nagreement with the aforementioned sample studies) and reveal that the largest area of strong\ncrustal fields lie in regions diametrically opposed to the Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium and\nOrientale impact basins (see Fig. 3). This led to the hypothesis that crustal magnetization\nis associated with basin-forming impacts. According to this hypothesis, the hypervelocity\n(>10 km/s) impacts that form such large basins produce a plasma cloud that expands around\nthe Moon, compressing and amplifying any pre-existing ambient magnetic field at the an-\ntipodal point (Hood and Huang 1991), where the focusing of seismic energy and impact of\nbasin ejecta may result in substantial shock remanent magnetization (Hood and Artemieva\n2008). A key element of this hypothesis is that it does not require a global dynamo field,\nalthough recently Wieczorek and Weiss (2010) have shown that the simplest explanation for\nsome of the strongest anomalies like Reiner-Gamma involves a steady, dynamo magnetic\nfield. Better maps enabled by ARTEMIS in the equatorial regions will help to elucidate the\nmechanism of antipodal magnetization by allowing us to better constrain the characteristics\nof the remanent crustal remanent magnetization.\n\nFig. 3 Impact basin rims (white circles, for Imbrium the interior ring is also shown) and their antipodes\n(black circles), superimposed on a map of total surface magnetic field strength averaged over 5 \u00d7 5? bins\n(Mitchell et al. 2008)\n\nReprinted from the journal 36\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nIn summary, the ARTEMIS electron reflection data set will substantially augment exist-\ning observations, enabling greater resolution in the equatorial regions and thus more con-\nfident interpretation. In so doing, ARTEMIS will improve our knowledge of the intercon-\nnected histories of lunar impacts, basin formation, magmatism and the ancient lunar dy-\nnamo.\n\n2.4.2 Effects of Crustal Anomalies on the Plasma Environment\n\nThe sub-ion inertial scale lengths associated with crustal magnetic anomalies raise a host\nof questions about the nature of their interaction with the solar wind. Does the solar wind-\nanomaly interaction produce a shock? Do the magnetic anomalies shield a region from the\nsolar wind, generating a lunar \u201cmini-magnetosphere\u201d that stands off and deflects the solar\nwind (Hood and Schubert 1980; Hood and Williams 1989; Hood 1992; Lin et al. 1998;\nHarnett and Winglee 2000)? Past and current missions have led to great progress on these\nquestions, but ARTEMIS stands ready to add to our knowledge, thanks to its comprehensive\nplasma instrumentation and two-probe design. ARTEMIS offers the unprecedented (at the\nMoon) capability to measure full 3-D plasma distributions and electric fields, allowing better\nunderstanding of the microphysics of the interaction, and to measure the properties of the\nplasma just upstream from the anomaly region, allowing separation of spatial and temporal\neffects. The results may be applicable to other bodies, including Mars (e.g., Breus et al.\n2005), asteroids such as Gaspra and Ida (Kivelson et al. 1995), and possibly Vesta (Vernazza\net al. 2006).\n\nExplorer 35 and the Apollo subsatellites first observed the effects of magnetic anomaly\ninteractions near the limb in the form of compressional waves propagating downstream. Lu-\nnar Prospector, however, observed the effects extending to ?100 km altitudes, sometimes\nwell upstream (>45?) from the limb and their apparent sources, seemingly requiring the for-\nmation of a shock (Lin et al. 1998). The coincident enhancements in the upstream electron\ndensity, electron flux, magnetic field strength, and whistler mode wave activity upstream\nseen in Fig. 4 all suggest the presence of a shock (Lin et al. 1998; Halekas et al. 2006b,\n2007, 2008b). By contrast, simulations for the solar wind interaction with dipoles with di-\nmensions comparable to lunar anomalies only predict whistler or magnetosonic wakes, not\nshocks (Omidi et al. 2002). Some simulations suggest that the non-dipolar nature of lu-\nnar magnetic sources might increase the efficiency of the interaction (Harnett and Winglee\n2003), perhaps resolving this discrepancy. Also, surface influences, including secondary\nelectrons, photoelectrons, and dust, may turn out to play a role. To determine whether lunar\nanomalies do in fact form shocks (Halekas et al. 2006a, 2006b), we need the capability of\nARTEMIS plasma instrumentation, which thanks to the spinning spacecraft and spacecraft\npotential measurements, can make precise measurements of bulk properties and anisotropies\nof the 3-D velocity distributions of both electrons and ions.\n\n2.4.3 Space Weathering: Effects of Crustal Anomalies on the Lunar Surface\n\nThe Moon, like any other body exposed to the harsh space environment, is subject to galac-\ntic and solar cosmic rays, irradiation, implantation, and sputtering from solar wind particles,\nand bombardment by meteorites and micrometeorites. This exposure causes radiation dam-\nage, chemical changes, optical changes, erosional sputtering, and heating, all essential parts\nof the process called space weathering. Space weathering is important because these pro-\ncesses affect the physical and optical properties of the surface of many planetary bodies.\nTo properly interpret remote sensing observations, it is critical to understand the effects of\nspace weathering.\n\n37 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nFig. 4 Lunar Prospector electron energy spectra, electron density, and magnetic field strength, longitude,\nand power frequency spectra suggestive of a shock\n\nA number of observations suggest that magnetic anomalies can shield the surface from\nthe solar wind, with clear implications for surface weathering, and possible implications\nfor the formation of the lunar albedo markings often observed near strong crustal magnetic\nsources (e.g., Hood and Schubert 1980; Richmond et al. 2005). Lunar Prospector obser-\nvations of low altitude density cavities above a strong crustal anomaly lend some support\nto this idea (Halekas et al. 2008a). More recent Kaguya observations of ion flow decelera-\ntion, electron heating, and no scattered protons above strong crustal anomalies also suggest\nsurface shielding (Saito et al. 2010). Finally, Chandrayaan has provided observations indi-\ncating no scattered neutral atoms from the same region discussed by Halekas et al. (2008a),\nstrongly suggesting the existence of a magnetically shielded surface region (Wieser et al.\n2010).\n\nThe two ARTEMIS probes will enable more observations like those by Kaguya, but\nwith more comprehensive plasma instrumentation, and the ability to compare observations\nupstream and outside of the anomaly region with those inside. This will enable separation\nof temporal and spatial effects, and allow researchers to clearly determine how the anomaly\ninteraction affects the incoming solar wind flow, including whether and how electrons and\nions de-couple near anomalies, what mechanisms produce electric fields, and the nature and\ndistribution of particle heating and wave-particle interactions.\n\n3 ARTEMIS Heliophysics Science Objectives\n\nARTEMIS will address the host of heliospheric science objectives illustrated in Fig. 5. Top-\nics include reconnection, particle acceleration, and turbulence in the magnetotail and inter-\nplanetary space, and the structure and evolution of the Moon\u2019s plasma wake. This section\npresents a selection of topics to be considered as a function of location in orbit: addressing\nsuccessively the Earth\u2019s magnetotail, the solar wind, and the lunar wake.\n\nReprinted from the journal 38\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nFig. 5 ARTEMIS heliophysics scientific objectives address topics including reconnection, particle acceler-\nation, and turbulence in the solar wind and Earth\u2019s magnetotail and the formation and evolution of the lunar\nwake\n\n3.1 In the Magnetotail\n\nThe Earth\u2019s magnetotail comprises two lobes with oppositely directed magnetic fields di-\nvided by an equatorial current sheet embedded within a plasma sheet marked by enhanced\ndensities and temperatures but depressed magnetic field strengths. Conditions within the\nnear-Earth magnetotail are relatively well-understood, thanks in large measure to the multi-\npoint measurements returned by the THEMIS mission. By contrast, fleeting glimpses of the\ndistant magnetotail by the Explorer-33 and -35, ISEE-3, Geotail, and Wind missions have\nraised numerous questions that can only be answered by examining extensive multipoint in\nsitu observations. Potential research topics include the structure of the distant magnetotail\nduring prolonged intervals of northward IMF orientation, the length, shape, and occurrence\npatterns for reconnection lines at lunar distances, the evolution of the heated and acceler-\nated flows ejected by these reconnection lines, the shape, dimensions, internal structure,\nand evolution of antisunward-moving plasmoids and flux ropes, boundary waves on the sur-\nface of the magnetotail, and the nature of turbulence within the Earth\u2019s magnetotail plasma\nsheet.\n\nARTEMIS will provide the observations needed to address these questions. Together\nwith the Moon, the two ARTEMIS spacecraft will spend about 4.5 days of each 28-day\norbit about the Earth within the magnetotail at lunar distances, and 20 to 30 hours per\norbit within the plasma sheet (Hapgood et al. 2007). With interspacecraft separation dis-\ntances ranging from 500 km to 20 RE, the two spacecraft will be well situated to determine\nnot only the steady-state macrostructure of the distant magnetotail, but also the meso- and\nmicro-scale characteristics of the superimposed transient events as a function of solar wind\nconditions.\n\n39 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\n3.1.1 Structure of the Magnetotail\n\nThe first question to be addressed concerns the structure of the distant magnetotail during\nprolonged intervals of northward IMF. Magnetosheath momentum imparted to the magne-\ntosphere drags magnetospheric magnetic field lines antisunward to form the Earth\u2019s mag-\nnetotail. During periods of southward IMF orientation, this momentum is imparted via the\nreconnection of magnetospheric and interplanetary magnetic field lines on the dayside mag-\nnetopause. Theory predicts, and observations confirm, that the Earth\u2019s polar caps lie on open\nmagnetic field lines leading to interplanetary space during intervals of southward IMF ori-\nentation (Dungey 1961). The situation during periods of northward IMF (NBZ) remains\nunclear. Reconnection on the dayside equatorial magnetopause ceases, terminating the pro-\nduction of open magnetic field lines. Reconnection within the magnetotail continues, trans-\nforming open lobe into closed plasma sheet magnetic field lines. The likelihood of dual lobe\nreconnection, which also closes open lobe field lines while appending magnetosheath mag-\nnetic field lines to the magnetosphere, increases. The magnetotail may become topologically\nclosed during prolonged NBZ periods.\n\nObservations from low altitude polar orbiting spacecraft like DMSP can be used to infer\nthe polar cap size, the amount of open flux in the lobes, and whether or not the magneto-\ntail ever closes. Low-altitude observations indicate that the size of the open magnetic field\nline region within the polar cap slowly diminishes during periods of strong and persistent\nnorthward IMF (Newell et al. 1997). However, spacecraft may fail to enter the polar caps\nwhen their size diminishes, resulting in a mistaken interpretation that they are absent. Fur-\nthermore, their identification can become more difficult during extended NBZ periods be-\ncause the characteristics of the precipitating particles used to identify their boundaries may\nchange. In the absence of clear predictions for the shape and geometry of the magnetotail\nand its plasma and magnetic field characteristics during NBZ periods, in situ observations\nof the magnetotail have also generally been inconclusive. A chance Wind encounter with\na strongly deformed and twisted magnetotail some 125 RE from Earth during an extended\nNBZ period on October 22\u201324, 2003 indicates an open magnetotail; albeit one with highly\nunusual plasma and magnetic field properties (\u00d8ieroset et al. 2008).\n\nGlobal numerical models for the magnetosphere predict strikingly different magneto-\nspheric topologies during NBZ periods. Many predict magnetospheres that close near Earth,\nas envisioned by Axford and Hines (1961). Others predict closed magnetospheres that ex-\ntend much further, perhaps in response to viscous momentum transfer enhanced by the\nKelvin-Helmbholtz instability (Miura 1984). Predicted lengths for the closed magnetotails\nvary from as little as ?30 to several hundred RE (Usadi et al. 1993; Watanabe and Sato 1990;\nOgino et al. 1992; Fedder and Lyon 1995; Gombosi et al. 1998; Guzdar et al. 2001). How-\never, not all models predict tail closure during NBZ periods. Raeder et al. (1995) presented\nidealized simulations of a NBZ period where the tail stayed open for several hours. In fact,\nRaeder (1999) argued that the prediction of a closed tail in most numerical MHD models\nwas due to excessive numerical diffusion, a point discussed in further detail by Gombosi\net al. (2000) and Raeder (2000).\n\nFigures 6 and 7 present Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM) pre-\ndictions for the size and shape of the Earth\u2019s magnetotail during the October 22\u201324, 2003\nWind event. The width of the magnetotail diminishes with distance downstream, but an open\nmagnetotail that flaps dawnward and duskward is still present at lunar distances.

The magnetotail is severely twisted and deformed\n\nwind and geomagnetic conditions, during both northward and southward IMF orientation.\nTwo point ARTEMIS measurements will aid in determining the orientations of the vari-\nous boundaries and the characteristics of their flapping motions. One of the two ARTEMIS\nprobes will frequently monitor magnetosheath conditions immediately outside the distant\nmagnetotail magnetopause while the other measures (e.g.) electron pitch angle distribu-\ntions at the magnetopause and deeper within the magnetotail, the key information needed\nto reveal magnetic field line topology and history in those regions (Hasegawa et al. 2005;\n\u00d8ieroset et al. 2008). Multi-season and multi-year observations will permit researchers to\ntest whether dual lobe reconnection for northward IMF orientations becomes more efficient\nwhen the Earth\u2019s dipolar tilt diminishes (Li et al. 2008).\n\n3.1.2 Plasmoids and Flux Ropes: Reconnection Within the Near-Earth Magnetotail\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 8, bursts of reconnection along extended lines in the near-Earth magne-\ntotail release immense antisunward-moving flux ropes, or plasmoids, that carry vast quanti-\nties of plasma and magnetic flux antisunward through the Earth\u2019s plasma sheet. Spacecraft\nin the vicinity of the plasma sheet may directly enter the plasmoids, while spacecraft within\nthe magnetotail lobes record perturbation signatures known as traveling compression re-\ngions (TCRs). In conjunction with Geotail, Cluster, and baseline THEMIS observations of\n\n41 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nFig. 8 Reconnection at an x-line in the near-Earth magnetotail results in dipolarizations of the magneto-\nspheric magnetic field and releases enormous plasmoids that move antisunward through the magnetotail.\nWhen separated transverse to the axis of the magnetotail, ARTEMIS probes P1 and P2 will be well-situated\nto determine the dimensions, shape, and internal structure of the plasmoids\n\nthe near-Earth magnetotail, and employing its own observations separated by 1\u201310 RE along\nthe Sun-Earth line, ARTEMIS will provide the observations needed to determine the internal\nstructure of plasmoids and track their evolution down the magnetotail.\n\nPlasmoid dimensions are a crucial factor in determining their significance to the solar\nwind-magnetosphere interaction. Plasmoid diameters increase by a factor of 2\u20133 from near-\ntail to lunar distances (Ieda et al. 1998), but the reasons for this growth remain unclear.\nPart of the growth results from expansion in response to lower ambient pressures in the dis-\ntant magnetotail, part may be due to continued reconnection at reconnection lines moving\ndown the magnetotail with the plasmoids, and part may be due to the coalescence of smaller\nplasmoids to form larger plasmoids as they are transported tailward. The cross-tail extent\nof plasmoids remains unknown. Although plasmoids in the distant magnetotail often ex-\nhibit force-free structures, their magnetic topology remains uncertain. Magnetic field lines\nwithin plasmoids may be closed loops, connected to Earth, or connected to the interplanetary\nmedium.\n\nAzimuthal probe separations of 1\u201310 RE will enable ARTEMIS to determine the cross-\ntail extent, orientation, and shape (using minimum variance analyses of the magnetic field)\nof plasmoids. Radial separations will provide the observations needed to determine how\nrapidly plasmoid diameters change with distance downstream (e.g., Slavin et al. 1999).\nGrad-Shafranov reconstruction techniques (Hasegawa et al. 2004) will be used to determine\nthe plasma and magnetic field structure within the plasmoids from time series measurements\nand an assumption that they are in near pressure balance with their immediate environment.\n\nReprinted from the journal 42\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nFig. 9 Reconnection along an\nextended and curved line in the\ndistant magnetotail. Because the\nline demarcates the boundary\nbetween sunward (Earthward)\nand antisunward flows, its\nlocation can be determined when\nARTEMIS probes P1 and P2 are\nradially separated. By contrast,\nits extent can be determined\nwhen the two spacecraft lie\nseparated transverse to the axis of\nthe magnetotail\n\nHigh time resolution ARTEMIS measurements of multiple pitch angle distributions during\nevents with anticipated time durations ranging from 100 to 200 s will not only offer an\nopportunity to determine their magnetic field topology, but also to test predictions concern-\ning reconnection-related electron energization in contracting magnetic islands (Drake et al.\n2006).\n\n3.1.3 Occurrence Patterns for Reconnection in the Distant Magnetotail\n\nBy contrast to the situation in the near-Earth plasma sheet, where reconnection associ-\nated with geomagnetic substorms is often bursty and patchy (Baumjohann et al. 1989,\n1990; Angelopoulos et al. 1992), ISEE-3, Geotail, and Wind observations of long-duration\nreconnection-heated plasma jets suggest that reconnection in the distant magnetotail plasma\nsheet is often quasi-steady and large-scale. As illustrated in Fig. 9, reconnection may occur\nalong curved reconnection lines whose cross-tail extent depends upon the IMF orientation\n(Feldman et al. 1985; Nishida et al. 1995; Angelopoulos et al. 1996; \u00d8ieroset et al. 2000).\nIn the absence of multi-point measurements, we do not know either the conditions favoring\nlocalized and extended reconnection in the distant magnetotail or the shape of the reconnec-\ntion line. Two-point ARTEMIS observations enable both the occurrence patterns of recon-\nnection and its extent across the lunar magnetotail to be determined as a function of guide\nfield strength, geomagnetic, and solar wind conditions.\n\n3.1.4 Heating, Particle Acceleration, and Plasma Transport at Distant Reconnection Lines\n\nThe plasma sheet within the distant magnetotail is an excellent location to study magnetic\nreconnection. By contrast to the near-Earth magnetotail, there is no heating in response to\nflow braking against the dipolar magnetic field lines. Furthermore, the finite mantle den-\nsities in the distant magnetotail mean that plasma parameters in the inflow region can be\nbetter characterized than they would be in the very tenuous near-Earth magnetotail. Topics\nfor investigation by ARTEMIS include the process(es) by which reconnection heats plas-\nmas, particle acceleration in reconnection geometries, and the subsequent motion of the\nreconnected plasma.\n\nThe degree to which reconnection heats ions, and the factors controlling this heating,\nare presently not known. Results from some recent simulations suggest that the heating is\nproportional to the speed of the outflowing Alfv\u00e9nic jets, which are in turn related to the\n\n43 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nAlfv\u00e9nic velocities of the inflowing plasma (Drake et al. 2009). The two ARTEMIS space-\ncraft will provide numerous opportunities to simultaneously compare inflow and outflow\nparameters.\n\nParticles can be accelerated to suprathermal energies by drifting along X-lines, but also\nby Fermi-acceleration in the collapsing bubbles that surround O-lines (Hoshino et al. 2001;\nDrake et al. 2006). Wind observations of a single event in the distant magnetotail (at\nXGSE = ?60 RE) provide evidence for electron energization to at least 300 keV (\u00d8ieroset\net al. 2002). Two-spacecraft ARTEMIS observations of plasma flows and magnetic field\ncomponents normal to the current sheet are essential to discriminate between (and track the\nmotion of) X-lines and O-lines. ARTEMIS will provide the previously unavailable high res-\nolution plasma and electric field measurements needed to determine the causes for electron\nenergization.\n\nSteady reconnection in the distant magnetotail should eject high-speed plasma flows\nand energized particles both Earthward and away from the Earth. The occurrence patterns\nand extents of distant magnetotail reconnection lines will be determined from two-point\nARTEMIS observations of the Earthward (antisunward) streaming energetic particles in the\nplasma sheet boundary layer, sunward (antisunward) flows, and northward (southward) mag-\nnetic field components in the current sheet expected sunward (antisunward) from the recon-\nnection line. There are indications that most of the sunward plasma jets from the distant tail\ndo not reach the near-Earth plasma sheet (e.g., \u00d8ieroset et al. 2004). Working in conjunction\nwith the three inner THEMIS spacecraft, Cluster, and Geotail, ARTEMIS will establish the\nrelationships between plasma flows in the lunar and near-Earth plasma sheet to determine\nthe fate of reconnection jets generated in the distant tail. The results will help distinguish\nbetween models in which the flows are decelerated and/or deflected towards the flanks.\n\n3.1.5 Boundary Waves, Flux Transfer Events, and Turbulence in the Magnetotail\n\nThe Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability may play an important role in transferring solar wind\nmass, momentum, and energy into the Earth\u2019s magnetotail (Fujimoto and Terasawa 1994;\nMiura 1984, 1992), perhaps dominating the overall solar wind-magnetosphere interaction\nduring intervals of northward IMF orientation when reconnection shuts down on the day-\nside magnetopause. The instability is most likely along the low-latitude flank magnetopause,\nwhere and when flow shears lie nearly perpendicular to weak northward magnetosheath and\nmagnetospheric magnetic fields (Southwood 1968). As illustrated in Fig. 10, the ampli-\ntudes and wavelengths of waves generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability should grow\n\nFig. 10 Illustrating the expected\nevolution of the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability\nfrom a linear stage on the dayside\nmagnetopause to a nonlinear\nstage on the flanks of the distant\nmagnetotail\n\nReprinted from the journal 44\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nwith downstream distance. The waves may merge into larger vortices (Miura 1997), perhaps\nwith steepened trailing edges (Chen and Kivelson 1993). They may also generate fast-mode\nshocklets (Lai and Lyu 2006) or induce turbulence (Matsumoto and Seki 2007). Simulations\nthat include the effects of coupling with the ionosphere and/or the tail lobes indicate that fi-\nnite plasma sheet thicknesses may suppress the nonlinear growth of the instability (Galinsky\nand Sonnerup 1994; Takagi et al. 2006).\n\nObservations indicate that the KH instability is relatively common on the flanks of the\nnear-Earth magnetotail, occurring for the predicted solar wind conditions and exhibiting the\nexpected signatures (Fairfield et al. 2000; Hasegawa et al. 2006). The structural properties\nof the KH waves are similar on the dawn and dusk flanks of the near-Earth magnetosphere\n(Hasegawa et al. 2006; Nishino et al. 2011). However, non-MHD processes that depend\non the polarity of the field-aligned vorticity could lead to dawn-dusk asymmetries further\ndownstream (Nakamura et al. 2010).\n\nAlthough the distant magnetotail magnetopause is constantly in motion, and this motion\nhas occasionally been attributed to the KH instability (Sibeck et al. 1987), little is known\nabout the properties of the instability at downstream distances beyond 30 RE. ARTEMIS\nwill provide the simultaneous two-point observations of magnetosheath and magnetosphere\nneeded to test instability criteria and determine the velocities, amplitudes, and wavelengths\nof the resulting boundary waves. Both the two-point observations, and comparisons with si-\nmultaneous Cluster and Geotail traversals of the near-Earth magnetopause, will help deter-\nmine whether waves breakup, coalesce, expand, stabilize, or simply propagate downstream.\nThe same two point observations will be examined for evidence of KH-generated recon-\nnection, diffusion, turbulence, shocklets, and dawn/dusk asymmetries (e.g. Chaston et al.\n2007).\n\nObservations on the dayside and near-Earth flank magnetopause reveal the presence of\ntwisted ropes of interconnected magnetosheath and magnetospheric magnetic field lines\nmarked by transient magnetic field strength increases and bipolar magnetic field signatures\nnormal to the nominal magnetopause. Interpreted as flux transfer events or FTEs, the flux\nropes provide evidence for the frequent occurrence of unsteady reconnection at the magne-\ntopause (Russell and Elphic 1978; Raeder 2006). The significance of the events to the over-\nall solar wind-magnetosphere interaction remains to be determined. If entirely disconnected\nfrom the ionosphere, the events may simply advect antisunward with the magnetosheath\nflow, maintaining their orientation and helical magnetic field geometry, and represent noth-\ning more than an interesting curiosity. However, if one end of the flux ropes remains an-\nchored in the ionosphere while the other extends into interplanetary space, the events may\naccount for a significant transfer of solar wind mass, energy and momentum to the mag-\nnetosphere. In this case, the flux ropes will stretch out parallel to the Sun-Earth line and\nsink into the magnetotail lobes (Sibeck and Siscoe 1984). Two-point ARTEMIS measure-\nments will help determine event motion, orientation, length, and topology at lunar distances,\nthereby providing crucial information concerning their role in the solar wind-magnetosphere\ninteraction.\n\nTurbulent dissipation is an effective mechanism for heating fluids and transferring mass,\nmomentum and energy. Although turbulence is ubiquitous in space plasmas, much remains\nto be determined concerning its initiation and subsequent evolution. Turbulence in the near-\nEarth plasma sheet has been studied using Cluster (Weygand et al. 2007). The dissipation\nrange was on the order of the ion inertial lengths or gyroradius (?few hundred km) and\nthe correlation coefficients diminished to zero beyond scales of 3 RE. Flow fluctuations\nwere small relative to the sound and Alfv\u00e9n speeds (except during dynamic conditions).\nBy contrast, flow fluctuations are comparable to the sound and Alfv\u00e9n speeds in the distant\n\n45 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nmagnetotail and therefore dynamically and energetically important. Theory and simulations\npoint towards magnetotail reconnection and velocity shears at the flanks as likely drivers\nof plasma sheet turbulence. Both drivers can affect energy circulation and particle transport\nwithin the magnetosphere. Characterizing the nature of the fluctuations, and determining\ntheir origin and dissipation is therefore important for global circulation. It is quite likely\nthat the distant tail also exhibits an inertial range of turbulence. ARTEMIS will use varying\ninterspacecraft separation distances to characterize turbulence over a wide range of spatial\nscales.\n\nARTEMIS may also observe turbulence at the distant magnetotail magnetopause. During\nperiods of northward or nearly radial IMF orientation, reconnection on the high-latitude and\nflank magnetopause results in high speed antisunward flows in a boundary layer of open\nmagnetic field lines disconnected from Earth. High-latitude reconnection can continue for\nhours under northward IMF conditions (Frey et al. 2003; Hasegawa et al. 2008). The distant\nhigh-latitude magnetopause is an ideal region to study turbulence in reconnection outflows.\nBy contrast to the dayside magnetopause, the effects of Alfv\u00e9n waves reflected from the\nionosphere need not be considered. And by contrast to the near-Earth plasma sheet, the\nresistance of the dipolar magnetic field region need not be addressed. ARTEMIS will de-\ntermine whether or not a quasi-steady inertial range of turbulence is attained as a result of\nenergy injection via reconnection. The two-point measurements permit estimations of the\nwavelength (instead of or in addition to the frequency) of the associated waves (Chaston\net al. 2008). A spacecraft in the magnetosheath can provide information about the nature of\nmagnetosheath turbulence and whether conditions favor high-latitude reconnection, thereby\nhelping discriminate between the effects of magnetosheath and reconnection-induced turbu-\nlence.\n\n3.2 In the Solar Wind\n\nTogether with the Moon, the ARTEMIS spacecraft will spend most of their orbit about the\nEarth in the solar wind. Here ARTEMIS provides a unique opportunity to address longstand-\ning questions concerning the physics of the foreshock, interplanetary shocks, reconnection\nin the solar wind, and plasma turbulence. In particular, ARTEMIS will be used to:\n\n\u2022 examine how the bow shock, and collisionless shocks in general, accelerate particles to\nhigh energies;\n\n\u2022 study the structure of interplanetary shocks, and examine how non-planar structure can,\nfor example, influence the production of type II radio emission;\n\n\u2022 explore reconnection in the solar wind, and provide the high time resolution measure-\nments required to understand low magnetic shear reconnection, which recent measure-\nments suggest predominates in the heliosphere.\n\n\u2022 fill in the gaps in our knowledge of solar wind turbulence by providing cross- observations\nof solar wind features from spacecraft separated by previously inaccessible intersepara-\ntion distances of 11,000\u201350,000 km.\n\n3.2.1 Shock Physics\u2014Particle Acceleration in the Terrestrial Foreshock\n\nIn addition to mediating the flow of super-magnetosonic plasma, collisionless shocks also\nact as sites for particle acceleration (see, e.g., reviews by Terasawa 2003; Burgess 2007).\nIf the upstream magnetic field is not perpendicular to the shock normal, then a portion of\nthe inflowing plasma can escape back into the upstream region rather than being processed\nby the shock; the interaction of this backstreaming component with the inflowing plasma\n\nReprinted from the journal 46\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nleads to wave generation and particle acceleration (Eastwood et al. 2005). The way in which\ncollisionless shocks produce energetic particles is a problem of extremely broad astrophysi-\ncal importance. The Earth\u2019s bow shock/foreshock is one of the best laboratories we have for\nstudying in-situ the basic physical processes that govern shock particle acceleration (Burgess\n2007).\n\nDiffusive shock acceleration (Axford et al. 1977; Bell 1978a, 1978b; Blandford and Os-\ntriker 1978) is widely cited as the process by which ions are accelerated to high energies\nat shocks. At the Earth\u2019s bow shock, ion energies extend to at least several MeV (Lin et al.\n1974; Desai et al. 2000). Diffusive shock acceleration theories predict that the density of en-\nergetic ions falls exponentially with distance from the shock front into the upstream region.\nOn a statistical basis, single spacecraft observations just upstream of the bow shock have\nshown that the energetic ion flux e-folding distance varies from 3.2+/?0.2 Re at 10 keV to\n9.3+/?1.0 Re at 67 keV (Trattner et al. 1994). In a two-spacecraft case study using Clus-\nter, Kis et al. (2004) and Kronberg et al. (2009) found the e-folding distance varied from\n0.5 Re at 11 to 2.8 Re at 27 keV, and increased almost linearly with energy up to ?120 keV.\nAlthough two-point observations provide a far more reliable measurement of the e-folding\ndistance, the Kis et al. (2004) and Kronberg et al. (2009) multipoint analysis studied only\none event, thus limiting their conclusions to high Mach number solar wind in a limited loca-\ntion (a few RE upstream of the shock) over a limited time interval (8 hours of data due to the\norbit of the spacecraft). Evidently a multi-point statistical survey is desirable and necessary\nto better understand the nature of accelerated particles upstream of the bow shock.\n\nARTEMIS will make extensive observations of the upstream region where particles are\naccelerated to high energies. ARTEMIS will not cross the sub-solar bow shock except during\nextreme solar wind conditions, e.g. very low solar wind Mach numbers (Farris and Russell\n1994), that would in itself result in serendipitous scientific discoveries. The presence of two\nspacecraft allows correlation lengths parallel and perpendicular to the field to be studied in\nthe key range of 0.1\u201320 RE without the confounding effects of upstream variability\u2014indeed\nobservations can be quantified according to upstream conditions. Foreshock energetic par-\nticles will be observed both intermittently and continuously over many days, providing ex-\ncellent statistics. The ARTEMIS probes will sample a much wider range of distances from\nthe shock than previously accessible, at various distances from the tangent line and over a\nwide range of depths in the foreshock.\n\nARTEMIS will also provide experimental data that challenges the common use of linear\ndiffusive shock acceleration theory. At the bow shock there is already incontrovertible ev-\nidence that the linear theory is insufficient; for example, magnetic field fluctuations do not\nexhibit the power law spectrum assumed by models over the required frequency range (Tera-\nsawa 1995). Although linear diffusive shock acceleration theory has been extended into the\nquasi-linear regime (where the energy flows from the particles to the waves, but the waves\nthemselves are given by linear theory) (Lee 1983), experimental tests of quasi-linear theo-\nries at the Earth\u2019s bow shock have not been carried out (Burgess 2007). Furthermore, recent\nlarge-scale hybrid simulations predict that rather than continuing to diminish, the energetic\nparticle flux approaches a constant at some point far upstream of the shock (Giacalone 2004).\nARTEMIS measurements will help to establish the homogeneity of the upstream wave field,\nof key importance for developing more complex theories of particle acceleration in the fore-\nshock.\n\nFinally, as noted by Burgess et al. (2005), diffusive shock acceleration has also often\nbeen challenged by the hypothesis that all upstream ion enhancements at Earth are exclu-\nsively magnetospheric in origin (e.g. Sarris et al. 1987). Although studies have concluded\nthat most upstream energetic ions do not originate in the magnetosphere (Gosling et al.\n\n47 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\n1989), the presence of energetic magnetospheric oxygen in the foreshock has been reported\n(Mobius et al. 1986). The combination of ARTEMIS, making measurements in the fore-\nshock, together with the remaining three THEMIS spacecraft at the magnetopause and in\nthe magnetosphere measuring changes in energetic ions and the state of the magnetosphere,\nwill allow the magnetospheric input of energetic particles to the shock to be deconvolved\nfrom diffusive shock acceleration better than ever before for a variety of solar wind condi-\ntions.\n\n3.2.2 The Structure of Interplanetary Shocks\n\nInterplanetary (IP) shocks energize particles, and observations in their vicinity can be used to\ntest theories of particle acceleration. They are thought to be responsible for the production of\nSolar Energetic Particles (SEPs) in so-called gradual events. In one study of particular note,\nKennel et al. (1986) used ISEE-3 observations of an IP shock to test the Lee (1983) quasi-\nlinear theory of diffusive shock acceleration. A number of disagreements were observed\nwhich could be explained by variations in the upstream conditions, but since data from only\na single spacecraft were available, this could not be resolved. By simultaneously observing\nthe conditions both up- and downstream of interplanetary shocks, and then generating statis-\ntics based on observations of many IP shocks during the course of the mission, ARTEMIS\nwill provide new information about how IP shocks generate energetic particles. The routine\nacquisition of spin resolution (3 s) plasma moments will be of particular importance in this\nregard. Figure 11 shows an example of an IP shock observed by both ARTEMIS spacecraft\non 5 April 2010. At this time the spacecraft were in transition from terrestrial to lunar orbit.\n\nRelated to this issue is the nature of type II radio emission. Type II radio emissions are\nthought to be generated patchily in the region upstream from Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)-\ndriven interplanetary shocks (Bale et al. 1999; Pulupa and Bale 2008), and are a useful tool\n\nFig. 11 ARTEMIS P1 (left) and P2 (right) observations of an interplanetary shock on 5 April 2010. From\ntop to bottom, the panels show: SST ion energy flux, ESA ion energy flux, SST electron energy flux, ESA\nelectron energy flux, ESA ion velocity components, ESA ion density, and FGM magnetic field components.\nNote that because the spacecraft were in transition from Earth to lunar orbit, they were widely separated at\nthis time. The ARTEMIS-1 encounter occurred at 08:12 UT and the ARTEMIS-2 encounter at 08:42 UT.\nBoth ARTEMIS spacecraft detected significant fluxes of energetic electrons and ions\n\nReprinted from the journal 48\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nfor tracing the propagation of CMEs through the heliosphere. It is still unclear whether the\nstructuring of type II emissions is due to the curvature of the shock on scales of 10 s of\nEarth radii, or due to the curvature of the magnetic field, although it is known that upstream\nturbulence alone cannot explain the dimensions of the acceleration regions inferred from\na single spacecraft (Pulupa and Bale 2008). Furthermore, the ultimate cause of any such\nrippled shock structures remains unclear, especially as a function of upstream conditions.\nSince the emissions are controlled by the shock structure, to better understand how type II\nemission is produced (and thus improve its utility in tracking CMEs) it is necessary to study\nhow shock structure varies with upstream plasma beta, Mach number (also related to the\nCME speed) and magnetic field orientation.\n\nARTEMIS measurements will allow investigation of IP shock rippling and inhomo-\ngeneities on scales of 0.1\u201320 RE, highly relevant to the problems discussed here (Pulupa\nand Bale 2008). Two-point measurements of magnetic field vectors will help determine the\ncurvature of magnetic field lines, while two-point measurements of shock normals will help\ndetermine shock curvature. Targeted burst mode operations will allow high (3 s) time res-\nolution 3-D ion and electron distributions to be captured, providing new details about the\nupstream structure and the presence of electron beams. Burst mode operations can be tar-\ngeted to capture the interplanetary shock crossing at high time resolution, including the 3-D\nelectric field, to better understand how the electron foreshock beams are created.\n\n3.2.3 Solar Wind Reconnection\n\nThe recent discovery of reconnection exhausts in the solar wind (Gosling et al. 2005) re-\nvealed a new laboratory for reconnection research. Extremely long X-lines, extending hun-\ndreds of Earth radii, have been reported in the solar wind (Phan et al. 2006, 2009; Gosling\net al. 2007a). All extended X-line events reported so far were found in large magnetic\nshear current sheets where the reconnection exhausts were wide. However, there are many\nmore low-magnetic shear (and much narrower) reconnection exhausts in the solar wind that\ncan only be resolved by high time resolution plasma measurements (Gosling et al. 2007b).\nARTEMIS, in conjunction with Wind, will allow the investigation of the extent of the re-\nconnection X-lines for low magnetic shears, and establish whether their X-line extent scales\nwith current sheet width as suggested in 3D simulations of reconnection (e.g. Shay et al.\n2003). The multi-point, high-resolution measurements will also be used to investigate the\nstructure of the reconnection exhaust as a function of the distance from the X-line.\n\n3.2.4 Solar Wind Turbulence\n\nTurbulence is a multi-scale phenomenon that mediates the transfer of energy, mass, and mo-\nmentum. The presence of turbulence within the solar wind has been well established from\nstudies of power spectra, probability distribution functions, scaling exponentials, Reynolds\nnumber determinations, etc. Most previous solar wind studies have not focused on the deter-\nmination of the three fundamental turbulence sale lengths: the correlation scale, the Taylor\nscale, and the dissipation scale. The correlation scale is associated with the largest possible\nturbulent eddy scale size. The Taylor scale is the scale size within the inertial range at which\nviscous damping begins to become important for eddy damping, and the dissipation scale is\nthe scale at which the turbulent eddies have been damped out and the particles are heated.\nStudies of these fundamental turbulence scales are important to help us understand cosmic\nray modulation and particle scattering within the solar wind.\n\n49 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nStudies of magnetic field fluctuations indicate that the correlation scale is on the order\nof several million kilometers and the Taylor scale on the order of a few thousand kilome-\nters (Mattheaus et al. 1990, 2005; Dasso et al. 2005; Weygand et al. 2007, 2009a, 2009b).\nHowever, Mattheus et al. (1990), Dasso et al. (2005), and Weygand et al. (2009a, 2009b)\nhave shown that solar wind turbulence is anisotropic and correlation scale can vary with\nthe respect to the mean magnetic field direction. Mattheaus et al. (1990) attribute this fea-\nture to two different types of turbulence present within the solar wind: slab and quasi-two\ndimensional turbulence. Both Mattheus et al. (1990) and Dasso et al. (2005) used sin-\ngle spacecraft observation to show this anisotropy in the turbulent magnetic field fluctu-\nations and determined the correlation scale by fitting an exponential function to autocor-\nrelation values. Dasso et al. (2005) subdivided results by solar wind speed. They showed\nthat the correlation scale is longest along the mean magnetic field direction in the slow so-\nlar wind (<400 km s?1) but longest in the perpendicular direction in the fast solar wind\n(>500 km s?1).\n\nWeygand et al. (2009a, 2009b) employed spacecraft pairs within the solar wind to avoid\nthe inherent assumption in previous studies that the solar wind magnetic field fluctuations are\nfrozen into the flow. The Weygand et al. (2009b) study demonstrated systematic variations\nof the two-dimensional cross-correlation function for slow, intermediate, and fast solar wind\nspeeds. However, two separate exponential fits were required to fit cross-correlation values\nacross the full range of spacecraft separations observed. The first exponential fit the corre-\nlation values obtained for large ACE, Geotail, IMP-8, Wind, and Interball-1 interseparation\ndistances, while the second exponential with a smaller decay length fit the much smaller\ninterspacecraft separations for the Cluster spacecraft. Weygand et al. (2009a) hypothesized\nthat this smaller scale resulted from instrumental differences or foreshock turbulence.\n\nHowever, limited THEMIS solar wind magnetic field measurements indicate that the sec-\nond exponential decay lengths at all solar wind speed ranges do not result from instrumental\nbias or foreshock turbulence, but rather represent real features in the solar wind. Figure 12\n(Weygand et al. 2009b) displays the cross correlation values versus the spacecraft separation\nfor various spacecraft pairs in the fast solar wind (>600 km/s). The blue values between the\ntwo vertical dashed lines are the cross-correlation values from the THEMIS B and C space-\ncraft.\n\nFig. 12 Cross-correlation\ncoefficients versus the distance\nseparating spacecraft for the fast\nsolar wind (>600 km/s) outside\nthe foreshock. Cluster\ncorrelations cover the range of\nseparations between 0 and\n?10,000 km in black. ACE,\nWind, Geotail, IMP8, and\nInterball-1 correlations cover\nseparations greater than\n100,000 km. Blue asterisks\nindicate limited THEMIS B and\nC correlations between the two\ndashed vertical lines. The range\ncurve results from a single\nexponential fit to all the data. The\ndashed curve represents the sum\nof two exponentials fit to all the\ndata\n\nReprinted from the journal 50\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nWhile the THEMIS cross correlation values have been an enormous help, the physical\nmeaning of the second exponential decay lengths remains unclear. It may be related to the\nhypothesis that turbulence is bound within solar wind flux tubes (Borovsky 2008). Large\ndecay lengths are related to the walls of the solar wind flux tubes while the small decay\nlengths are associated with the correlation scale of the magnetic field turbulence within the\nflux tubes.\n\nARTEMIS will play a critical role in these investigations. Inter-separation distances at the\nMoon will range from 500 km to about 31,000 km, precisely filling in the poorly sampled\nregion from 1.5 \u00d7 104 to 3.0 \u00d7 104 km where Fig. 12 indicates a transition between the two\nexponential fits.\n\n3.2.5 Upstream Monitors\n\nIn lunar orbit, ARTEMIS will be an excellent monitor of the solar wind conditions upstream\nfrom the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere. Unlike Earth-orbiting satellites, ARTEMIS will remain\noutside the magnetosphere for extended periods of time, and will, for example, be able to\nobserve the entire passage of a CME. As such, ARTEMIS will provide useful input to global\nsimulations of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere and services such as the Community Coordinated\nModeling Center (CCMC). ARTEMIS will be closer to the Earth than existing L1 solar wind\nmonitors, and therefore offers a more precise measurement of the exact solar wind input to\nthe magnetosphere\u2014such measurements will be of use to other teams studying the magneto-\nsphere with both satellite- and ground-based experiments. Finally, by comparing ARTEMIS\ndata to that from L1 monitors such as ACE and Wind, it will be possible to develop new\nmodels that advect L1 solar wind monitoring data to the Earth, thereby improving our un-\nderstanding of how L1 monitoring data should be used to predict magnetospheric dynamics.\n\n3.3 The Lunar Wake\n\nAs an essentially non-magnetic and non-conducting body with no ionosphere, the Moon ab-\nsorbs most of the incident solar wind plasma, leaving a plasma void, or wake, within plasma\nflows (Schubert and Lichtenstein 1974). The plasma cavity formed downstream from the\nMoon represents one of the best natural plasma vacuums in the solar system, and an excel-\nlent basic physics laboratory for understanding the general process of plasma expansion into\na vacuum, with applications ranging from low-altitude earth orbiting satellites to outer planet\nmoons. Although the lunar wake has been studied since the Apollo era (Ness et al. 1967;\nColburn et al. 1967), we still do not fully understand many aspects of its formation, dynam-\nics, and refilling.\n\nNevertheless, our understanding of the wake has advanced with each new lunar mis-\nsion. Far from being a passive region, the wake hosts a wide variety of dynamic phe-\nnomena (see Fig. 13). Wind, with a suite of modern plasma instruments, made a number\nof lunar flybys and discovered a wake extending to at least 25 RL downstream (Clack\net al. 2004), counter-streaming anisotropic ion beams refilling the wake along magnetic\nfield lines (Ogilvie et al. 1996; Clack et al. 2004), and electrostatic and electromag-\nnetic plasma waves in and around the wake (Kellogg et al. 1996; Farrell et al. 1996;\nBale et al. 1997). Nozomi observed non-thermal ions and counter-streaming electrons up-\nstream from the Moon (Futaana et al. 2001, 2003), possibly associated with wake processes.\nGeotail observed ULF waves associated with the lunar wake region (Nakagawa et al. 2003).\nLunar Prospector discovered the important role of non-Maxwellian solar wind electrons\nin driving low-altitude wake refilling (Halekas et al. 2005). Kaguya, Chang\u2019E, and Chan-\ndrayaan discovered ion scattering from the dayside surface (Saito et al. 2010; Wieser et al.\n\n51 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nFig. 13 Our current understanding of the electrodynamics of the Moon\u2019s interaction with the solar wind. The\nMoon carves out a cavity, known as the wake, in the oncoming solar wind. Ion beams stream inward to fill\nthe cavity, which is bounded by rarefaction waves, diamagnetic currents, and inward-pointing electric fields.\nCrustal magnetic anomalies may launch shocks into the solar wind, while the nightside lunar surface charges\nnegative and emits secondary electrons\n\n2009), and observed gyrating protons (Type-I entry) and re-picked up scattered protons\n(Type-II entry) refilling the low altitude wake perpendicular to magnetic field lines (Nishino\net al. 2009a, 2009b; Holmstrom et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010).\n\nWhile these observations have shed light on the global structure of the lunar wake and\nemphasized the need to treat it kinetically, our understanding of the physical nature of the\nwake and how it refills is limited primarily due to the relative paucity of in situ measure-\nments made in the region. Early Explorer and Apollo satellites carried limited plasma in-\nstrumentation and the Lunar Prospector instrument package did not include ion detectors or\nelectric field analyzers. Wind provided a relatively complete plasma data set from the lunar\nwake, but made only a handful of passes, leaving wake coverage far from complete. No-\nzomi and Geotail also have made only a very limited number of lunar flybys. Chandrayaan,\nChang\u2019E, and Kaguya only observed the wake over narrow ranges of distances from the\nMoon. To date, there has not been a dedicated mission to provide comprehensive coverage\nof the lunar wake over a wide range of distances and complete our understanding of its\nstructure.\n\n3.3.1 Structure of the Wake\n\nGlobal hybrid simulations (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) confirm that kinetic effects are im-\nportant. Figure 14, showing the formation of a plasma void in the lunar wake that is refilled\nby two beams counter-streaming along magnetic field lines in X\u2013Y plane, demonstrates the\ncomplex structure of the lunar wake even for ambient magnetic field orientations that lie\ntransverse to the wake axis. The same simulation also indicates that the lunar wake could\nextend well beyond 25 RL downstream.\n\nReprinted from the journal 52\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nFig. 14 Results from a global hybrid simulation for the interaction of the solar wind with the Moon. Proton\ndensities, normalized to the value in the unperturbed solar wind, are shown in the X\u2013Y plane containing the\nIMF, which points in the Y -direction. The results show the formation of a plasma void in the lunar wake that\nis refilled by two beams counter-streaming along magnetic field lines\n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 13, asymmetries in the lunar wake structure are expected when-\never the magnetic field does not lie parallel to the wake, since diamagnetic current systems,\nand the resulting magnetic field perturbations, differ for perpendicular vs. parallel magnetic\nfields. In addition, limb compressions are often observed external to the wake cavity and\nrarefaction wave, located downstream from crustal magnetic anomalies (Russell and Licht-\nenstein 1975). Previous measurements suggest that these structures are compressional fea-\ntures (Siscoe et al. 1969) that propagate outward at magnetosonic wave velocities (Whang\nand Ness 1970). One expects them to propagate downstream from crustal magnetic field re-\ngions, producing a highly asymmetric structure external to the main wake cavity. However,\nno observations have clearly confirmed this supposition, or determined how far downstream\nthese features propagate and to what degree they affect the structure of the wake interior to\nthem. Many observations have found asymmetric wake characteristics on individual orbits\n(Ness et al. 1968), but single spacecraft cannot clearly distinguish between asymmetries and\ntemporal variations.\n\nThe orbital coverage and complete plasma instrumentation of ARTEMIS will enable a\ncomprehensive determination of the wake\u2019s extent and structure. The two-point measure-\nments provided by ARTEMIS will allow unambiguous identification of asymmetries in the\nwake due to the perturbing influences of solar wind and crustal magnetic fields or other\neffects.\n\n3.3.2 Wake Refilling and Dynamics\n\nPrevious missions have measured several modes of wake refilling, but we do not yet un-\nderstand their relative importance or the interplay between them. Wind saw ion beams\naccelerated along magnetic field lines into the wake from the flanks (Ogilvie et al. 1996;\nClack et al. 2004) several lunar radii downstream, implying a potential drop across the wake\nboundary that occurs as a natural consequence of the pressure gradient across the wake\nboundary and the difference in electron and ion thermal velocities. Simulations have con-\ntributed greatly to our understanding of this process, which refills the wake along magnetic\nfield lines (Farrell et al. 1998; Birch and Chapman 2001, 2002; Kallio 2005; Travnicek et al.\n2005; Kimura and Nakagawa 2008). Meanwhile, recent low altitude observations show that\n\n53 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nD.G. Sibeck et al.\n\nthe wake also refills perpendicular to magnetic field lines (Nishino et al. 2009a, 2009b;\nHolmstrom et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2010). Only ARTEMIS, with its elliptical orbit, can\nunravel the interplay between parallel and perpendicular refilling processes, and determine\ntheir relative importance as a function of location in the wake.\n\nThe wake provides a rich laboratory for plasma waves and instabilities, with a broad\nspectrum of waves observed in the central wake (Kellogg et al. 1996), and even far up-\nstream on magnetic field lines connected to the wake boundary (Nakagawa et al. 2003;\nFarrell et al. 1996; Bale et al. 1997). Waves observed to date include ion acoustic waves and\nLangmuir waves from instabilities related to differential ion/electron shadowing (Bale et al.\n1997), and whistlers produced by beam instabilities near the wake boundary (Nakagawa\net al. 2003; Farrell et al. 1996, 2008). Waves predicted but not conclusively observed be-\nfore ARTEMIS include instabilities generated by counter-streaming electrons in the central\nwake (Birch and Chapman 2001, 2002), ion acoustic-like interactions generated by refilling\nion beams in the central wake (Farrell et al. 1998), and low frequency electromagnetic tur-\nbulence with frequencies near the local proton gyrofrequency (Travnicek et al. 2005). Most\nrecently, Kaguya has observed broad spectrum electrostatic turbulence associated with a\ntwo-stream instability formed by electrons pulled into the wake along field lines by the su-\nperabundance of charge from pickup ion Type II entry perpendicular to magnetic field lines\n(Nishino et al. 2010). We have barely explored this menagerie of plasma waves, and the\ninstability growth mechanisms and wave-particle interactions remain far from understood.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 15, the first lunar wake flyby by ARTEMIS revealed electrostatic os-\ncillations associated with counter-streaming electrons in the central wake and the regions\nmagnetically connected to it, providing the first confirmation for the predictions of Nak-\nagawa et al. (2003) and Birch and Chapman (2001, 2002). See Halekas et al. (2011, this\n\nFig. 15 Observations from the first lunar wake flyby by ARTEMIS probe P1 on Feb 13, 2010. The fig-\nure shows energy-time spectrograms for electrons streaming parallel (0\u201315? pitch angle) and anti-parallel\n(165\u2013180?) to the magnetic field (in eV/(cm2 s sr eV)), and an electric field wave frequency-time spectro-\ngram. The anti-parallel streaming solar wind strahl population penetrates all the way through the wake from\nthe exit side, while most of the core population is excluded from the central wake by the wake potential.\nA residual core population penetrates from the entry side of the wake, and is accelerated outward by the wake\npotential, forming a counter-streaming distribution that excites electrostatic oscillations\n\nReprinted from the journal 54\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Science Objectives\n\nissue) for more details. Further passes will enable researchers to determine the distribution\nof wave activity within the wake.\n\n3.3.3 Response to External Drivers\n\nThe wake structure will certainly vary in dynamic response to external drivers. Several stud-\nies (Ogilvie and Ness 1969; Colburn et al. 1971; Whang and Ness 1972; Halekas et al.\n2005) provide tantalizing hints how the wake responds to changing solar wind conditions,\nbut the limited data and orbital coverage of the previous missions constrains our knowledge\nof this response to external drivers. Hybrid simulations have shown that the orientation of\nthe IMF with respect to the solar wind flow direction affects both the downstream extent and\nsymmetry of the lunar wake (Travnicek et al. 2005).\n\nAlthough the Moon spends the majority of its time in the solar wind, it also spends\n?5 days each month in the terrestrial magnetosphere, where the plasma environment differs\ngreatly from that in the solar wind. Magnetic field configurations and flow speeds in the\nplasma sheet are highly variable, which should result in lunar wakes very different from\nthose in the solar wind. For example, reconnection beyond 60 RE should result in sunward\nplasma sheet plasma flows and a sunward-orientated wake.\n\nUsing dual-probe measurements, ARTEMIS will determine the response of the lunar\nwake to solar wind drivers. ARTEMIS will provide the first detailed measurement of the\nlunar wake plasma environment within the terrestrial magnetosphere.\n\n4 Concluding Remarks\n\nFrom vantage points near and in orbit about the Moon, ARTEMIS will provide the com-\nprehensive two-point particle and electromagnetic field observations needed to chart and\nunderstand a host of planetary phenomena. Observations of pick-up ions will be used to\ndetermine the composition of the exosphere and hence the lunar surface as a function of\nexternal conditions. Electric fields that can loft dust in the vicinity of the Moon will be mea-\nsured both directly and remotely. The structure of crustal magnetic anomalies that shield\nsome regions of the Moon while creating mini-magnetospheres complete with bow shocks\nin the oncoming solar wind will be mapped.\n\nThe same lunar vantage points offer an opportunity to address a series of longstanding\nheliospheric research problems. ARTEMIS will map the structure of the Earth\u2019s magnetotail,\ndetermining its structure and the characteristics of magnetic reconnection, particle energiza-\ntion, and turbulence as function of solar wind conditions. While in the solar wind, the two\nspacecraft will provide the observations needed to understand reconnection at interplanetary\ndiscontinuities and particle acceleration at both the Earth\u2019s bow shock and interplanetary\nshocks. They will also serve as excellent monitors of the solar wind input into the magne-\ntosphere for other forthcoming NASA and international missions. Finally, the ARTEMIS\nspacecraft will provide the comprehensive observations needed to understand the steady-\nstate and time-dependent structure of and processes within the lunar wake.\n\nThe novel repurposing of the outermost two THEMIS spacecraft demonstrates the cre-\nativity of the THEMIS/ARTEMIS team at its best. It has set the stage for potentially dramatic\nadvances in our understanding of the Moon and its environment. This will be a joint under-\ntaking of both the THEMIS/ARTEMIS team and the international community, for all of the\nobservations returned by ARTEMIS will become immediately available via the mission\u2019s\nweb site, themis.ssl.Berkeley.edu, just as is the case for THEMIS.\n\n55 Reprinted from the journal\n\nhttp://themis.ssl.Berkeley.edu\n\n\nD.G.

Although the spacecraft and fuel resources were tailored to space observations from\nEarth orbit, sufficient fuel margins, spacecraft capability, and operational flexibility were\npresent that with a circuitous, ballistic, constrained-thrust trajectory, new scientific informa-\ntion could be gleaned from the instruments near the Moon and in lunar orbit. We discuss\nthe challenges of ARTEMIS trajectory design and describe its current implementation to\naddress both heliophysics and planetary science objectives. In particular, we explain the\nchallenges imposed by the constraints of the orbiting hardware and describe the trajectory\nsolutions found in prolonged ballistic flight paths that include multiple lunar approaches,\nlunar flybys, low-energy trajectory segments, lunar Lissajous orbits, and low-lunar-periapse\norbits. We conclude with a discussion of the risks that we took to enable the development\nand implementation of ARTEMIS.\n\nKeywords ARTEMIS \u00b7 THEMIS \u00b7 Low-energy transfer \u00b7 Lissajous orbits \u00b7 Lunar science \u00b7\nLunar mission \u00b7 Heliophysics \u00b7 Magnetosphere\n\n1 Introduction\n\nTime History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) is a very\nsuccessful NASA Explorer mission launched in February of 2007 to advance our under-\nstanding of magnetic substorms, a space weather phenomenon in the Earth\u2019s magneto-\nsphere (Angelopoulos 2008).

As of the time of\nthis writing, the baseline mission science objectives have been achieved, and all five probes\n(and their instruments) are fully functional.\n\nIn February 2008 ARTEMIS, the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence and Electro-\ndynamics of the Moon\u2019s Interaction with the Sun mission, was proposed to the NASA He-\nliophysics Senior Review (Angelopoulos and Sibeck 2008) as an extension to the THEMIS\nmission. It was approved for development in May of that year. The ARTEMIS mission pro-\nposed to send the two outermost THEMIS probes, P1 and P2 (also referred to as THEMIS-B\nand THEMIS-C), to lunar orbits by way of two circuitous transfers that take about one and\na half years each. The goals of the mission as proposed in 2008 were to use the Moon as an\nanchor for the ARTEMIS probes to conduct studies of Earth\u2019s magnetotail and solar wind\nfrom approximately 60 Earth radii and to study the lunar wake and its refilling as a function\nof the upstream solar wind. ARTEMIS two-point measurements open a new vantage point to\nphenomena previously studied by single-spacecraft missions. In particular, when solar wind\nmeasurements are made simultaneously by one probe in the lunar wake and the second from\nvarious locations just upstream of the lunar wake, accurate comparisons of wake phenomena\nwith upstream variations can be made.\n\nThe ARTEMIS proposal represented the combined efforts of the THEMIS science team\nled by the PI at UCLA, the THEMIS Mission Operations team led by the Mission Opera-\ntions Manager at the University of California Berkeley\u2019s Space Science Laboratory (UCB-\nSSL), the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nat the California Institute of Technology (JPL). Two earlier reports (Broschart et al. 2009;\nWoodard et al. 2009) describe the preliminary mission design as proposed in 2008; portions\nof this paper are taken from those reports. This paper presents the evolution of the trajectory\ndesign to the trajectory being flown today, only a few months after lunar orbit delivery.\n\nNumerous challenges were inherent to the ARTEMIS mission\u2019s trajectory design be-\ncause of the constrained capabilities of the THEMIS probes. Limited fuel remained after the\nTHEMIS baseline mission was completed. Thruster configuration limits thrust directions\nto one hemisphere. Additionally, an on-off thruster duty cycle imposed due to the spinning\nof the probe bus restricts effective thrust to less than a newton in the spin plane, i.e., for\nmaneuver directions near the ecliptic plane. Maneuvers cannot be done in shadow because\naccurate pulse timing relies on sun-sensor data. Telecommunications with the probes were\nlimited to a range of about two million kilometers. Finally, the probes can only withstand\nup to a 4-hour shadow. Had nothing been done at the end of the THEMIS baseline mission,\nlong eclipses (>8 hr) would have neutralized P1 by March 2010 (Angelopoulos 2010). This\nbecame a very significant driver for proposing the ARTEMIS mission.\n\nIn Sect. 2 we describe the capabilities and orbit configuration of the THEMIS probes at\nthe end of their baseline mission. In Sect. 3 we outline the history of the ARTEMIS mission\ndesign concept as it followed the mission\u2019s programmatic evolution. Section 4 outlines the\nscience goals and orbit design goals of the mission. The remainder of the paper describes\nthe design of the trajectories that have taken P1 and P2 from eccentric, high-altitude Earth\norbits into lunar orbits that satisfy the science objectives. Figure 1 shows the ARTEMIS\ntrajectory design used to send P1 and P2 from their respective Earth orbits at the start of\nARTEMIS maneuvers into lunar Lissajous orbits. Section 5 presents the most up-to-date\nARTEMIS mission design. Section 6 describes the current mission status, including ongoing\ntrade studies. Section 7 is a retrospective on the challenges and enabling attributes of the\nmission design effort.\n\nReprinted from the journal 62\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Mission Design\n\nFig. 1 ARTEMIS trans-lunar trajectories in the ecliptic plane.

The orbit\ngeometries are indicated by black\nlines\n\n2 Spacecraft Overview\n\nOn February 17th, 2007, the five THEMIS probes were launched on a Delta-II 7925 rocket\ninto a 1.3-day Earth orbit with perigee at 437 km altitude and apogee at ?87500 km alti-\ntude (Angelopoulos 2008). Based on initial on-orbit data\u2014in particular, better link mar-\ngin performance\u2014THEMIS-B was assigned to a 4-day orbit and designated \u201cP1\u201d, and\nTHEMIS-C was assigned to a 2-day orbit and designated \u201cP2\u201d. THEMIS-D, E, and A were\nassigned to 1-day orbits, becoming P3, 4 and 5, respectively, per the mission design plan\n(Frey et al. 2008) required to achieve THEMIS mission science goals (Fig. 2) (Angelopou-\nlos 2008). After 29 months in orbit, the two outermost probes, P1 and P2, were called on to\njourney to the Moon as part of the ARTEMIS mission.\n\n63 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H. Sweetser et al.\n\nFig. 3 THEMIS/ARTEMIS probe configuration. The probe buses were manufactured by ATK Space\nSystems (formerly Swales Aerospace), and the instruments were manufactured under the leadership of\nthe University of California, Berkeley with both US and international collaborators.

Blue arrow indicates spin axis\n\nThe five THEMIS probes were identical at launch with 134 kg mass (including 49 kg\nof hydrazine monopropellant). Each measures approximately 0.8 \u00d7 0.8 \u00d7 1.0 meters (Har-\nvey et al. 2008). On orbit, each has deployed a number of instrument booms and is spin-\nstabilized at ?20 RPM. Figure 3(a) shows a THEMIS probe with booms deployed. Fig-\nure 3(b) shows a schematic of the bus design. The blue arrow, which indicates the spin\nvector, shall be referred to as the probe +Z direction.\n\nEach probe has four thrusters, nominally 4.4 N each, with locations indicated by the black\narrows in Fig. 3(b). Two provide axial thrust (acceleration in +Z direction) for large ?V\nmaneuvers and attitude control. The other two provide tangential thrust in the spin plane for\nsmall ?V maneuvers and spin rate control. Note that the probes cannot apply acceleration\nin the ?Z direction. During the nominal THEMIS mission, P1 and P2 were flown with the\n?Z axis close to the ecliptic north pole, i.e., in an \u201cupside-down\u201d configuration relative\nto ecliptic north and opposite the inner three probes. This was done to aid the main orbit\ncorrection maneuvers in the second year of THEMIS, which were designed to counteract\nlunar perturbations on the orbit plane (Frey et al. 2008). ARTEMIS would maintain the\nsame orientation, as it is quite fuel-intensive to impart spin-axis changes to the probes. Thus,\nmaneuvers towards ecliptic north could not be included in the ARTEMIS trajectory design.\nAt launch, each probe had 960 m/s total ?V capability (Harvey et al. 2008). At the start of\nARTEMIS maneuvers the remaining ?V (approximately 320 m/s for P1 and 467 m/s for\nP2) were available for the ARTEMIS trajectory design. Due to fuel tank depressurization\n(Sholl et al. 2007; Frey et al. 2008), each thruster is expected to produce between 2.4 N and\n1.6 N force during the ARTEMIS mission.\n\nBecause the spacecraft is spinning the effective thrust of a sideways burn is further re-\nduced, so a maneuver in a particular direction in the spin plane is performed by pulsing the\nthrusters on and off during each revolution. With a 60 deg pulse duration , the thrusters are\non only one-sixth of the time (16.7% duty cycle). Because thrusters are swinging through\nan arc, the thrust in the desired direction is further reduced to 95.5% effective thrust; with a\n40 deg duty cycle the thrusters average only one-ninth thrust, but lose only 2% in efficiency\naveraged through the arc of each pulse. Only the second reduction in each case influences\n\nReprinted from the journal 64\n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/images/content/164405main_THEMIS-Spacecraft_bus2.jpg\n\n\nARTEMIS Mission Design\n\nthe effective Isp, so a 40 deg duty cycle would be preferred to a 60 deg one except that lower\nthrust means longer burns during periapse passages, which would increase gravity losses.\n\nThe thermal and power systems have been designed to withstand shadowing from the Sun\nfor up to three hours (Harvey et al. 2008). It was demonstrated in March of 2009, however,\nthat a 4-hour shadow is survivable with appropriate precautions. This limit is therefore being\nused as the maximum allowable shadow duration for the ARTEMIS mission design, where\n\u201cshadow\u201d is defined to be less than 50% sunlight.\n\n3 ARTEMIS Concept Development\n\nThe baseline THEMIS mission design included the expectation that P1 would experience\ninordinately long (>8 hr) shadows by March 2010. Although the apoapse altitude of the P1\norbit could have been reduced to prevent this, THEMIS scientists and JPL mission design-\ners came up with the idea of sending P1 \u201cup\u201d instead of \u201cdown\u201d in 2005. With THEMIS\ninstrumentation, compelling science could be conducted near or at the Moon with a sin-\ngle probe. According to initial trajectory studies, a direct transfer from P1 Earth orbit to a\n1500 km altitude by 18,000 km radius polar orbit at the Moon would require ?500 m/s of\n?V (not including margin or losses associated with long thrust arcs). This was well beyond\nP1\u2019s expected ?V capability at the end of the baseline mission.However, the remaining fuel\nappeared sufficient to transfer P1 from its Earth orbit to the desired eccentric lunar orbit by\nway of a lunar swing-by and low-energy transfer (Chung et al. 2005). When initiated by a\nlunar swing-by, this type of transfer does not require any less ?V to leave Earth, but saves\nessentially all the ?V cost of getting into a Lissajous orbit around one of the Earth-Moon\nLagrange points. It does this by using solar gravity tidal perturbations to make the three-\nbody energy change on the trajectory that would otherwise have to be done propulsively\nat arrival near the Moon. The fuel reserves on P2 offered similar capability, suggesting the\npossibility of sending two THEMIS probes to the Moon.\n\nWith the encouraging initial trajectory design results in hand, proposals for funding to\nsupport a detailed design study of low-energy trans-lunar trajectories, feasibility studies\nrelated to the THEMIS hardware, and optimization of the remaining THEMIS mission for\nP1 and P2 were made in 2006 and 2007. Although these proposals were not selected for\nfunding, the science team continued concept development as time permitted.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, internal JPL funding became available to support an Explorer\nprogram Mission of Opportunity proposal for a THEMIS mission extension that would be-\ncome ARTEMIS. A team from the JPL Inner Planets Mission Analysis group was convened\nto design trajectories to the Moon for P1 and P2. Building on the work done in 2005, the\nJPL team (working closely with the THEMIS science and mission operations teams) devel-\noped a workable trajectory within THEMIS probe constraints that provided the opportunity\nfor a highly rewarding scientific mission. This formed the baseline trajectory of the current\nARTEMIS mission. Midway through this preliminary design effort, NASA headquarters ad-\nvised the ARTEMIS team that the new mission would be more appropriately proposed as an\nextended mission for THEMIS, rather than as a mission of opportunity. At around the same\ntime, the mission operations team at UCB-SSL was augmented by navigators and maneu-\nver designers at GSFC who contributed operations experience with Lissajous and translunar\norbits to the design effort.\n\nThe complete preliminary design for the extended mission was presented to the Senior\nReview Board for the Heliophysics Division in February 2008 (Angelopoulos and Sibeck\n2008); approval to proceed with detailed design was given in May of that year. The pre-\nliminary trajectory design that was presented to the Senior Review Board is described in\n\n65 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H. Sweetser et al.\n\nBroschart et al. (2009). This paper is an update of that earlier design paper; the design de-\nscribed there has changed significantly since the approval to proceed. As was understood\nat the time, the series of Earth orbits leading up to the initial lunar flybys needed to be sig-\nnificantly redesigned. More recently, a number of changes have been made in the science\noperations phase of ARTEMIS.\n\nIn 2009 it was recognized that significant additional scientific benefits from ARTEMIS\ncould be obtained for the Planetary Division of NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate. The\nteam was invited to propose an amendment to its Heliophysics plan that addressed Planetary\nobjectives. The proposal was returned by NASA/HQ, and the invitation was re-extended for\nsubmission in the 2010 Senior Review cycle, so both Heliophysics and Planetary aspects of\nthe ARTEMIS proposal could be evaluated by a joint panel. ARTEMIS/Heliophysics was\ngiven the go-ahead to continue operations in June 2010. The ARTEMIS/Planetary decision,\nthough delayed until December 2010, was also positive. The 2008 preliminary design of\nARTEMIS\u2019s lunar orbits needed to be modified to accommodate planetary objectives by\nlowering periapse altitudes, raising inclinations, and adjusting the lines of apsides for better\noverlap of measurements with those of NASA\u2019s Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment\nExplorer (LADEE) mission.\n\nThe Planetary Division\u2019s decision to execute the planetary objectives of the mission came\nonly 3 months prior to the baseline ARTEMIS lunar orbit insertion (originally slated for\nApril 2011). This did not leave sufficient time for performing the necessary lunar orbit opti-\nmization to meet the expanded science objectives. Therefore, the team decided to postpone\ninsertion to June-July 2011 to enable further study of the planetary aspects of the investiga-\ntion. This postponement in turn entailed modifications to both the Lissajous phase and the\ntransition to lunar orbits.\n\nThe ARTEMIS science objectives and the characteristics of orbits that would satisfy\nthem (for both Heliophysics and Planetary Divisions of the Science Mission Directorate) as\nproposed and accepted by the 2010 Senior Review were described in Angelopoulos (2010).\nThe revised mission design described in this paper represents the ARTEMIS orbit execution\nplan as actually implemented.\n\n4 ARTEMIS Science Goals\n\nAngelopoulos (2010) gives a comprehensive overview of ARTEMIS mission science objec-\ntives and describes how the mission design and operations are structured to meet them. Here\nwe describe aspects of the mission that drive mission design.\n\nEach probe is equipped with a suite of five particle and field instruments used to study\ngeomagnetic substorm activity during the nominal THEMIS mission. These instruments\ninclude a Fluxgate Magnetometer, a Search Coil Magnetometer, an Electric Field Instru-\nment, an Electrostatic Analyzer, and a Solid State Telescope (Angelopoulos 2008). This\ninstrumentation suite allows the probe to measure the 3D distribution of thermal and super-\nthermal ions and electrons and the AC and DC magnetic and electric fields to study the\ninteraction between the Earth\u2019s magnetic field and the Sun\u2019s magnetic field and solar wind.\nBy expanding the spatial extent of THEMIS\u2019s multiple, identically-instrumented spacecraft,\nARTEMIS allows us to study plasmoids in the magnetotail, particle acceleration and turbu-\nlence in the magnetotail and the solar wind. Furthermore, ARTEMIS will study lunar wake\nformation and evolution for the first time with two identical, nearby probes, thereby resolv-\ning spatio-temporal ambiguities. The aforementioned heliophysics objectives of the mission\ncan be addressed by inter-spacecraft separations and wake downstream crossings that are\n\nReprinted from the journal 66\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Mission Design\n\ninitially as large as 20 Earth radii and are progressively reduced to 1000 km or less. This\ngoal is achieved initially by having the ARTEMIS probes at large separations in Lissajous\norbits around two (and later one) of the Earth-Moon Lagrange points, and subsequently by\ninsertion of probes into lunar orbits with ? 18,000 km apoapse radius and highly variable\nangular separation between their lines of apsides.\n\nARTEMIS also offers a unique opportunity to contribute to planetary science. From its\nunique orbits ARTEMIS will study the \u201csources and transport of exospheric and sputtered\nspecies; charging and circulation of dust by electric fields; structure and composition of\nthe lunar interior by electromagnetic (EM) sounding; and surface properties and planetary\nhistory, as evidenced in crustal magnetism. Additionally, ARTEMIS\u2019s goals and instrumen-\ntation complement LRO\u2019s [Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter\u2019s] extended phase measurements\nof the lunar exosphere and of the lunar radiation environment by providing high fidelity lo-\ncal solar wind data. ARTEMIS\u2019s electric field and plasma data also support LADEE\u2019s prime\ngoal of understanding exospheric neutral particle and dust particle generation and transport\u201d\n(Angelopoulos 2010).\n\nTo achieve these objectives, ARTEMIS requires both high- and low-altitude measure-\nments by one spacecraft, while the other measures the pristine solar wind nearby. Low pe-\nriapses are very important in increasing the ability of ARTEMIS to measure sputtered ions\nand crustal magnetism in situ. For this reason periapse altitudes less than 50 km are highly\ndesired. Additionally, the latitude of periapsis is an important consideration for lunar crustal\nmagnetism\u2014increased periapsis latitude provides opportunities for covering a larger portion\nof the lunar surface. A latitude greater than 10 deg (goal 20 deg) is highly desirable. Finally,\nconjunctions with LADEE at the dawn terminator necessitate that one of the ARTEMIS\nprobes have its periapsis positioned near the dawn terminator and pass through periapse\nclose to the time of LADEE passage through that region. These design considerations have\nbeen incorporated into the current planning for the upcoming lunar orbit insertions (LOIs).\n\n5 ARTEMIS Trajectory Design\n\nFigure 1 shows the ARTEMIS trajectory design that sent P1 and P2 from their respective\norbits at the end of the THEMIS primary mission to insertion into lunar Lissajous orbit.\nThe P1 trajectory is shown in red, and the P2 trajectory is shown in blue. The design suc-\nceeded in meeting both the trajectory constraints imposed by the probe capabilities and the\nrequirements derived from the science objectives.\n\nIn the following subsections, the trajectory is broken up into phases for detailed discus-\nsion. These include the Earth orbit phase, the trans-lunar phase, the Lissajous orbit phase,\nand the lunar orbit phase. An integrated timeline of the events for P1 and P2 in these four\nmission phases can be found in Table 1; an integrated ?V budget is given in Table 2.\n\n5.1 Earth Orbit Phase Trajectories\n\nWhen the preliminary design was being developed to show the feasibility of ARTEMIS, the\norbit raise did not appear to present any particular challenge, so this phase was simplified\nto a single impulsive velocity increase at perigee, followed by a number of Earth orbits\nincluding lunar approaches that modified the orbit and culminated in the lunar flyby that\nbegins the low-energy transfer to the Moon. This simplification allowed one track of the\ndesign effort to focus most strongly on the lunar flyby and transfer; the series of finite orbit\nraise maneuvers (ORMs) to raise the Earth orbit could be developed later in parallel on a\nseparate design track.\n\n67 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H.

The labels on\nthe plot provide information about key events during this phase of the mission.\n\nThe design of the P2 Earth orbits phase was similar, as shown in Fig. 5, but lasted two\nmonths longer because it started from a smaller Earth orbit and a longer series of finite\nmaneuvers needed to be included to raise the orbit.\n\nAs we gradually came to realize, the reference trajectory design for the Earth orbit phase\nof both P1 and P2 would turn out to be significantly more complex than a simple series of\nmaneuvers to replace the preliminary design\u2019s impulsive orbit raise maneuver. This com-\nplexity stemmed from: (1) probe operational constraints, (2) the tight ?V budget, (3) the\nprecision phasing required to reach the designed low-energy transfers to the Moon, and\n(4) the actual initial states for ARTEMIS P1, P2 in the summer of 2009. These actual states\nended up significantly different from the initial states that were predicted in 2005\u20132007; this\nchange was due to deterministic orbit-change maneuvers that occurred in 2008, mid-way\nthrough the THEMIS mission, to improve science yield for the second THEMIS tail season\n(Fig. 6 shows this difference for the P1 orbit). As expected, the actual orbit raise required\nperigee burns on multiple orbits due to the small thrust capability. The design of these burns\nwas challenging because generally an optimal design of highly elliptical transfers is numer-\nically difficult, and because lunar approaches created a complex three-body design space.\n\n69 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H. Sweetser et al.\n\nFig. 4 Earth orbit portion of the P1 trajectory design.

Distances quoted are ranges measured from the center\nof mass of the Earth or Moon\n\nDuring the refinement of the orbit design, it was recognized that several factors conspired\nto further complicate the development of the reference trajectory:\n\n1. Earth\u2019s shadow covers perigee for much of the orbit raise season, prohibiting thrusting\nat/near perigee. The design necessitated splitting most perigee burns into two (A and B)\nburn arcs bracketing the shadow, further increasing burn arc length and gravity losses.\n\nReprinted from the journal 70\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Mission Design\n\nFig. 6 (a) Initial orbit of the Earth orbit portion of the P1 preliminary trajectory design. The initial condition\nfor ARTEMIS P1 predicted when ARTEMIS was proposed is in green; the actual starting orbit is in red.\n(b) End-on view of (a)\n\n2. The initial propellant load of ? 50% for P2 forced a large fraction of the maneuvers to\nbe performed at a lower duty cycle (shorter pulse) due to the propellant load being near a\n\u201cslosh resonance\u201d (Sholl et al. 2007; Auslander et al. 2008; Frey et al. 2008). This further\nexacerbated gravity losses, necessitating more maneuvers to obtain the same total orbit-\nraise ?V . This was addressed by starting the ORM sequence for P2 as early as July 20,\n2009.\n\n3. Side thrusting for orbit-raise maneuvers also results in a small reorientation (precession)\nof the spin axis due to a small offset of the thrust direction relative to the probe center of\nmass. The cumulative effect of side thrusting has been significant spin-plane precession\nof the probes in directions that either violated operational constraints or increased losses\nfrom vector-thrusting. Spin axis reorientation maneuvers were included in the mission\ndesign to account for that effect.\n\n4. Thrust restrictions due to the absence of \u201cup\u201d thrusting capability posed a non-traditional\nrestriction to the mission design. The usual intuition that 1 burn allows targeting of 3\nelements and 2 burns separated in time allows for the targeting of 6 elements is not correct\nfor ARTEMIS. In fact, even 3 separated burns can fail to provide 6-element targeting\nwhen all maneuvers are confined to a single plane.\n\n5.1.1 Orbit-Raise Design Process\n\nThe P1 and P2 orbit-raise designs were constructed using Mystic software (Whiffen 1999;\nWhiffen 2006). Mystic was able to accommodate all mission constraints outlined above.\nHowever, the complex (and often treacherous) design space resulting from numerous lunar\napproaches during the orbit-raise phase made simple design strategies impossible. To pro-\nvide some robustness against missed burns, and sufficient tracking data for orbit/maneuver\nreconstruction, perigee maneuvers were double-spaced, i.e., two orbits apart. On occasion\nit proved advantageous to separate burns even farther to take advantage of or avoid strong\nlunar interactions. Most perigee burns were divided into and modeled as two separate burn\narcs, one on either side of the Earth\u2019s shadow. The duration and pointing of each burn was\n\n71 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H. Sweetser et al.\n\nfully optimized using Mystic, with the constraint that the end states of this phase would be\non the translunar trajectories already designed.\n\nSeveral different end-to-end orbit-raise strategies were thus attempted for both P1 and\nP2, with the desired translunar injection as a goal and the initial ARTEMIS state as a start-\ning point as early as needed, i.e., with an ascend start date unrestricted by THEMIS science\nconsiderations. The strategy that proved most successful for the P1 trajectory was to first op-\ntimize sets of burns on three double-spaced perigees to reach an orbital period of 131 hours.\nFrom states near this point forward, there existed a tremendous number of possible paths in-\nvolving differing lunar interactions, numbers of Earth revolutions, plane changes, and node\nchanges over the next 140 days of ballistic propagation. It was not at all obvious which of\nthese many paths might be feasible, and then which feasible path would be best to rejoin the\nlow-energy transfer. To address this problem, a large number of ballistic trajectories were\nused as initial guesses for targeting and optimization. Different families were organized\nbased on the number of Earth revolutions. A computer cluster was used for this compute-\nintensive process. Trajectories that were found to be feasible or nearly feasible were then\nfurther refined by moving the time of rejoining the low-energy transfer to successively later\ndates.\n\n5.1.2 P1 and P2 Orbit-Raise Designs\n\nThe P1 low-energy transfer began with a pair of lunar flybys separated by only 14 days\u2014see\nFigs. 7 and 8. To minimize the ?V cost of getting onto the designed translunar trajectory,\nit seems desirable to match these flybys as closely as possible, though exact matching does\nnot seem to be necessary. Intuitively, re-joining the low-energy transfer at later times would\nprovide increasing efficiency, since a longer time would allow a lower rendezvous velocity.\nIt was expected (and found) that re-joining much beyond the second lunar flyby provided\ndiminishing returns. The final total effective ?V for P1\u2019s Earth orbit phase as actually flown\nwas 102.7 m/s (compare this to the 103.7 m/s allocation (see Table 2) and the 125 m/s\nconservative estimate in the ARTEMIS proposal (Angelopoulos and Sibeck 2008) from a\nsingle-impulse Earth departure, which included 24 m/s for gravity and steering losses and\ntrajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs)). The final design maneuvers are given in Table 3,\n\nFig. 7 P1\u2019s final Earth orbits\nleading into the low-energy\ntransfer, showing an oblique view\nof the final lunar approach (which\nchanged the orbit inclination\nsignificantly) and the first of the\ntwo lunar flybys that initiated the\ntransfer. The green arcs along\ntwo of the orbit periapses show\nwhere the flyby targeting\nmaneuvers (FTM1A, FTM1B,\nand FTM2) were performed\n\nReprinted from the journal 72\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Mission Design\n\nFig. 8 Trans-lunar portion of the P1 trajectory design. Distances quoted are ranges measured from the center\nof mass of the Earth or Moon\n\nalong with trajectory correction maneuvers designed by the mission operations team during\nthe execution of this phase.\n\nThe P2 orbit design was more complex than the P1 design because P2 begins in a much\nsmaller orbit. A process similar to the P1 design process was used to develop the P2 orbit-\nraise design. Very careful planning of distant lunar approaches was necessary to stay within\nthe allocated ?V budget, which was more constraining for P2 than for P1. The P2 orbit raise\nrequired 42 burns, counting each split maneuver as two burns (see Table 4). The method\nused was a branching process. Each orbit-raise maneuver was designed several times to\nreach different orbital periods (different period = different \u201cbranch\u201d). Subsequent maneu-\nvers reaching longer periods were designed for each branch. The most promising branches\nwere continued; poorly performing branches were abandoned. Poorly performing branches\noften led to situations in which lunar interactions reduced the orbit period or required long\nperiods without maneuvers to avoid disadvantageous lunar interactions. Highly performing\nbranches ended up with advantageous distant lunar interactions early on. Distant lunar in-\nteractions that provided maneuver savings as little as 1 meter per second early in the orbit\nraise were sought. The final few orbit-raise maneuvers required very careful planning to\nmaximize the positive influence of the Moon.\n\nA major additional complication of the P2 trajectory design occurred shortly before the\nfirst ORM, when a check for eclipses found an unacceptably long passage through Earth\u2019s\nshadow just after the ORMs and before the first lunar flyby. Additional shadow-deflection\nmaneuvers (SDMs) were added to change the orbit plane to reduce the time in shadow and\nthen change the orbit plane back to return to the planned flyby conditions. These SDMs\nsolved the problem without requiring a complete redesign of the series of ORMs, though at\na cost of 11 m/s in additional ?V . Even with these maneuvers added, the final total effective\n?V for P2\u2019s Earth orbit phase as actually flown was 254.8 m/s (compare to the 245.7 m/s\nallocated and the 219 m/s originally estimated (Angelopoulos and Sibeck 2008) from the\n\n73 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H.

The trajectory\nis shown in the same Sun-Earth synodic coordinate frame used in Figs. 4 and 5. In the figure\nthe trajectory begins on the right side of the plot with \u201cLunar Fly-by #1\u201d. The P1 trajectory\nmade use of a \u201cback-flip\u201d, wherein the first lunar fly-by set up a second lunar fly-by on\nthe opposite side of the Moon\u2019s orbit ?14 days later. The back-flip can be seen clearly in\nthe out-of-plane view insert in the bottom left of Fig. 8 and the beginning of it is shown\nin Fig. 7. This second flyby raised the apogee significantly, throwing the probe out beyond\nthe Moon\u2019s orbit towards the Sun. This began the low-energy trajectory leg for P1, which\nis characterized by significant gravitational perturbation imparted on the probe by the Sun.\nThis low-energy trajectory had two deep-space legs that included one relatively small deep-\nspace maneuver (DSM). After the second leg, the orbit perigee had been raised to lunar\ndistance, and the phasing with the Moon\u2019s orbit was such that the probe moved into a lunar\nLissajous orbit around lunar Lagrange point #2 (LL2) without requiring any deterministic\ninsertion maneuver.

Sweetser et al.\n\nFig. 9 Trans-lunar portion of the P2 trajectory design. Distances quoted are ranges measured from the center\nof mass of the Earth or Moon\n\nregion where the perturbative influence of solar gravity is significant. P2 followed a low-\nenergy trajectory that included three deep-space legs before entering a lunar Lissajous orbit\naround lunar Lagrange Point #1 (LL1) without any deterministic thrusting. The P2 trajec-\ntory included three deep-space maneuvers (DSM), one of which was relatively large; these\nmaneuvers totaled 30.4 m/s. P2 arrived in Lissajous orbit about 2 months after P1, requiring\na total of 458 days since the start of ARTEMIS maneuver operations to reach this stage.\n\n5.2.1 Transfer Trajectory Implementation\n\nAs the transfer trajectory was flown, correction maneuvers were required to adjust for earlier\nmaneuver execution and probe pointing and implementation errors, as well as navigation\nerrors. These maneuvers, called trajectory correction maneuvers (TCMs), encompassed the\nstatistical maneuvers along the transfer. TCMs in addition to DSMs were inserted in each of\nthe P1 and P2 designs.\n\nWe allocated 4% of the total propellant budget of each probe to perform any required\nTCMs along the way to control the energy to keep P1 and P2 near their appropriate out-\ngoing trajectories. Since the two probes had already completed their primary mission in a\nhighly elliptical Earth orbit, propellant was extremely limited. Thus, with the unique oper-\national constraints, accomplishment of the transfer goals with the minimum propellant cost\nwas the highest priority. To implement the mission design, our trajectory simulations use a\nfull ephemeris model with point-mass gravity representing Earth, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, Sat-\nurn, Venus, and Mars. Also included is an eighth degree and order Earth potential model.\nThe solar radiation pressure force is based on: (1) the measured probe area, (2) the probe\nestimated mass (from bookkeeping), and (3) the coefficient of reflectivity determined by\nnavigation estimation. The same models with estimates for the mass usage and coefficient\nof reflectivity were used in the mission design process that determined the reference trajec-\ntory. The trajectory propagations in operations were based on a variable step Runge-Kutta\n\nReprinted from the journal 76\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Mission Design\n\n8/9 and Prince-Dormand 8/9 integrator. Initial conditions used throughout the planning pro-\ncess correspond to the UCB-delivered navigation solutions using the DSN and the UCB\ntracking system. Software tools used in this process include the General Mission Analysis\nTool (GMAT) developed at GSFC as an open source, high-fidelity tool with optimization\nand MATLAB connectivity and AGI\u2019s STK/Astrogator suite.\n\nTo compute actual commanded maneuver ?V requirements, we used two numerical\nmethods: differential corrections (DC) targeting using central or forward differencing and an\noptimization method using the VF13AD algorithm from the Harwell library. A DC process\nprovided a priori conditions. Equality constraints were incorporated for DC application;\nnonlinear equality and inequality constraints were employed for optimization. These con-\nstraints incorporated both the desired target conditions in the Earth-Moon system and probe\nconstraints on the ?V direction and relationship between the spin axis and the ?V vector.\n\nThe end goal of the transfer phase was to achieve the Earth-Moon Lissajous insertion\nconditions necessary for a minimal energy insertion into the Earth-Moon L2 or L1 Lis-\nsajous orbits. The goals were defined in terms of states expressed in Earth J2000 coordi-\nnates. These targets were held constant over the entire mission design and implementation\nprocess once the reference translunar transfer had been designed. Although a baseline tra-\njectory was defined to design the mission, the adaptive strategy used in operations required\nexactly matching this baseline only at the end of the transfer.\n\n5.2.2 Navigation Uncertainties\n\nThroughout the transfer trajectory implementation process, navigation solutions were gen-\nerated at a regular frequency of once every three days with the exception of post-maneuver\nnavigation solutions, which were made available as soon as a converged solution was de-\ntermined. The rapid response was to ensure that the maneuver had performed as predicted\nand that no unanticipated major changes to the design were necessary. The RSS of the un-\ncertainties were on the order of tens of meters in position and below 1 cm/s in velocity.\nAs a conservative estimate for maneuver planning and error analysis, 1? uncertainties of\n1 km in position and 1 cm/s in velocity were used. These accuracies were obtained using\nnominal tracking arcs of one three-hour contact every other day. The Goddard Trajectory\nDetermination System (GTDS) was used for all navigation estimations.\n\n5.2.3 Trajectory Design During Operations\n\nThe transfer trajectory implementation approach used the numerical methods discussed\nabove augmented by dynamical systems theory for verification and to gain knowledge of the\ntransfer dynamics. The probes were targeted to the libration point orbit insertion locations\nknowing full well that maneuver execution and navigation errors would push the path off\nthe \u201cbaseline\u201d design. A correction maneuver scenario was planned that would essentially\nshift the trajectory, such that the new path would be consistent with a nearby manifold. It\nwas decided to use a forward-integrating numerical optimization process that included probe\nconstraints to calculate optimized ?V s. This procedure permitted minimization of the ?V\nmagnitude, variation of the ?V components in direction, as well as variation of the maneu-\nver epoch, while incorporating the nonlinear constraint on the probe ?V direction relative\nto the spin axis.\n\nOriginally, it was envisioned that errors in navigation and maneuvers could lead to the\nneed for an unobtainable correction in an \u201cup\u201d direction with respect to the ecliptic plane.\nFortunately, experience with trajectory design on other missions that incorporate weak sta-\nbility regions near Sun-Earth libration orbits and near the ecliptic plane showed us that we\n\n77 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H. Sweetser et al.\n\ncould allow upward ?V corrections to be delayed until an equivalent magnitude but oppo-\nsite direction (downward) ?V location could be found in the long-duration transfer. These\nlocations were then used to correct the trajectories without any upward maneuver component\nto achieve the final Earth-moon insertion targets.\n\nAs the TCMs were performed, the path essentially jumped from the vicinity of one local\ntransfer manifold to another at a slightly different energy level. The number of optimized\nTCMs was very low and their magnitudes quite small, considering the sensitivity of the\ndynamics and uncertainties of the OD solutions.\n\n5.2.4 Maneuver Design\n\nTo target to the desired Earth-Moon Lissajous conditions, a VF13AD optimizer was used.\nWe optimized each maneuver to determine the minimal ?V location. To determine an a\npriori maneuver location and to achieve an intuitive feel for the maneuver results, a DC\nprocess was first performed using planned DSN coverage. For P1, the first four TCMs were\ncompleted in Earth-centered elliptical orbit or during lunar gravity-assist targeting. Maneu-\nver execution errors are small, only a few percent. These errors are a function of actual\nstart time with respect to a sun pulse of a spinning spacecraft, tank temperatures, attitude\nknowledge, and general propulsion system performance.\n\nIt should be noted that maneuver execution errors, current navigation errors, and subse-\nquent maneuvers to correct for these errors along with small mis-modeled perturbations can\nlead not only to late or early arrival times at the prescribed Lissajous insertion location, but\nalso may contribute to out-of-plane effects and may result in trajectories that intersect with\nthe Moon. Clearly, the trajectory is very sensitive to such small variations. But that sensitiv-\nity also implies that small corrections can alter the trajectory design significantly and allow\nlow ?V cost orbit control, assuming sufficiently frequent tracking for orbit reconstruction.\n\n5.3 Lissajous Orbit Phase Trajectories\n\nThe Lissajous orbit phase of ARTEMIS has permitted repeated observations of the distant\nlunar wake. For the first ?1.5 months of this phase (from August 22 to October 2, 2010),\nP1 was alone at the Moon in orbit around the LL2 point while P2 was still en route. P2\nthen arrived, making a partial orbit around LL2 on its way to Lissajous orbit at LL1. For\nabout the next 2.3 months, P1 orbited LL2 while P2 orbited LL1, and then P1 also crossed\nover to orbit LL1. During this phase, the trajectories permit 16 independent observations\nof the lunar wake when crossing behind the Moon on the anti-Sun side, observations of\nthe distant Earth magnetotail once per month when the Moon\u2019s orbit passes through it, and\nobservations of the pristine solar wind when out of the influence of both. These two-point\nmeasurements were made at separation scales up to ?100,000 km when the probes were\nin orbit around different Lagrange points and up to ?50,000 km when both orbit LL1.\nDistant magnetotail measurements can also be correlated with concurrent measurements\nfrom THEMIS-A, THEMIS-D, and THEMIS-E in low-Earth orbit.\n\nFigure 10 shows the P1 trajectory during the Lissajous orbit phase. In this figure, the\nMoon is at the origin and the trajectory is drawn in the Earth-Moon synodic coordinate\nframe, which rotates such that the Earth is always to the left along the negative X axis. The\nZ axis is aligned with the angular momentum vector of the Moon\u2019s geocentric orbit. The\nmain figure on the left side shows the view looking down on the geocentric orbital plane of\nthe Moon, and the two insets show perspectives from within the Moon\u2019s orbital plane. The\nLL1 and LL2 points are marked in the figure.\n\nReprinted from the journal 78\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Mission Design\n\nFig. 10 Lissajous orbit phase of the P1 trajectory. Distances given are ranges measured from the lunar center\nof mass unless otherwise specified\n\nP1 entered Lissajous orbit around LL2 on August 25, 2010 with only a stochastic ma-\nneuver to begin station-keeping. Although the initial Lissajous orbit was somewhat inclined\nwith respect to the Moon\u2019s geocentric orbit plane, the orbit flattened after a few orbits (see\nFig. 10 inserts). After ?129 days in orbit around LL2, P1\u2019s trajectory followed an unsta-\nble orbit manifold along a 10-day heteroclinic connection to a Lissajous orbit around LL1\n(Howell et al. 1997; Koon et al. 2000). Although this transfer required no deterministic ?V\nfor initiation or insertion, in practice weekly station-keeping maneuvers (SKMs) were re-\nquired to maintain the Lissajous orbit. P1 spent 158 days orbiting LL1 before executing a\nsmall maneuver to depart from Lissajous orbit on June 18, 2011. The probe descended to an\n1850 km periselene altitude, where the lunar-orbit insertion (LOI) maneuver was executed,\nbeginning the lunar orbit phase on June 27, 2011. At the time of LOI, P1 had operated for\n707 days since the beginning of the ARTEMIS mission.\n\nFigure 11 shows the P2 trajectory during the Lissajous orbit phase. P2 entered Lissajous\norbit around LL1 on October 20, 2010. As with P1, this insertion was achieved without\nany deterministic ?V because the incoming trans-lunar trajectory approached on the stable\nmanifold of this particular Lissajous orbit. P2 stayed in this nearly planar Lissajous orbit for\nabout 8.5 months before initiating descent to a ?3800 km altitude periselene. The LOI ma-\nneuver for P2 occurred on July 17, 2011, at which time P2 had been operating for 727 days\nsince the end of the nominal THEMIS mission.\n\nAfter P1 and P2 entered their Lissajous orbits, a project decision was made to extend\nthe Lissajous phase from April to July. This required adding axial components to SKM18\non February 1, 2011, for P1 and to SKM11 (January 4), SKM13 (January 18), and SKM15\n(February 1) for P2. These axial burns, which directly affected the Z velocity of the probes\nin the Earth-Moon frame, were needed to prevent the Z axis components of the Lissajous\norbit states from oscillating too much. These oscillations otherwise would have grown to\nuncontrollable levels before the transition to lunar orbits despite ARTEMIS\u2019s stationkeeping\nprocess.\n\n79 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H. Sweetser et al.\n\nFig. 11 Lissajous orbit phase of the P2 trajectory design. Distances given are ranges measured from the\nlunar center of mass unless otherwise specified\n\nThe Lissajous orbit phase of the ARTEMIS mission were particularly exciting because\nthe ARTEMIS probes are the first to fly in a lunar Lissajous orbit. Flying these orbits was\na challenge for operations and maneuver design teams because Lissajous orbits are inher-\nently very unstable; small, unavoidable deviations from the Lissajous orbit are amplified\nto problematic proportions (Howell and Keeter 1995) after approximately one revolution\n(?14 days). This leaves little room for error in the operations. Because of this instability,\ncorrection maneuvers needed to be executed about weekly to keep the probes in orbit. So\neven though these orbits required no deterministic ?V , orbit maintenance ?V was required.\n\n5.3.1 Stationkeeping\n\nThere are many stationkeeping methods to chose from: classical control theory or linear ap-\nproximations of Farquhar (1971), Farquhar and Kamel (1973), Breakwell and Brown (1979),\nand Hoffman (1993), provided analysis and discussion of stability and control in the Earth-\nMoon collinear L1 and L2 regions; Renault and Scheeres (2003) offered a statistical analysis\napproach; Howell and Keeter (1995) addressed the use of selected maneuvers to eliminate\nthe unstable modes associated with a reference orbit; and G\u00f3mez et al. (1998) developed\nand applied the approach specifically to translunar libration point orbits. Folta et al. (2010)\npresented an analysis of stationkeeping options and transfers between the Earth-Moon loca-\ntions and the use of numerical models that include discrete linear quadratic regulators and\ndifferential correctors.\n\nThe ARTEMIS stationkeeping method used maneuvers performed at optimal locations\nto minimize the ?V requirements while ensuring continuation of the orbit over several rev-\nolutions downstream. There are no reference trajectories to plan against, so other methods\nsuch as linear (continuous) controllers are impractical. Likewise, other targeting along the\nX axis or Y axis is more costly or cannot be attained without violating probe constraints.\nGoals in the form of energy achieved, velocities, or time at any location along the orbit\n\nReprinted from the journal 80\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Mission Design\n\ncan be used, but our goal was defined in terms of the X velocity component at the X axis\ncrossings. This assumes selection of a velocity that can be related to the orbit energy at any\nparticular time. To initialize the analysis, a DC scheme is used, based on the construction\nof an invertible sensitivity matrix by numerical sampling of orbital parameters downstream\nas a consequence of specific initial velocity perturbations (Folta et al. 2010). The orbit is\ncontinued over several revolutions by checking the conditions at each successive goal then\ncontinued to the next goal. This allows perturbations to be modeled over multiple revolu-\ntions.\n\nThe targeting algorithm uses an impulsive maneuver with variables of either Cartesian\n?V components or ?V magnitude and azimuth angle within the ARTEMIS spin plane.\nTarget goals are specified uniquely for each controlled orbit class because LL1 and LL2\ndynamics differ slightly. The velocity target chosen is specifically set to continue the orbit\nin the proper direction. Targeting is then implemented with parameters assigned at the X\u2013Z\nplane crossing such that the orbit is balanced and another revolution is achieved. Each im-\npulsive maneuver is targeted to the X component of the velocity at the third X axis crossing\nafter the maneuver; the maneuver supplies velocity (energy) in a direction that subsequently\ncontinues the libration point orbit. Additionally, the VF13AD1 optimizer is used to min-\nimize the stationkeeping ?V by optimizing the direction of the ?V and the location (or\ntime) of the maneuver. Included in the DC and optimization process are constraints required\nto keep the ARTEMIS maneuvers in the spin plane.\n\nGiven the constraints of the ARTEMIS mission orbit, probe maneuvers were planned\nat a seven-day frequency to ensure a stable navigation solution while minimizing the ?V s\nand staying within the ARTEMIS ?V budget. The maneuvers were originally planned to\noccur at or near the X axis crossings and to use a continuation method to maintain the\norbit. As operational experience was gained, however, it was found possible to relax the\nlocation of each maneuver in order to permit a more user-friendly operational schedule.\nOrbital conditions were set to permit the energy or velocity at the crossings to continue the\norbit for at least 2 revolutions.\n\nSince oscillations in the Z component of the state are largely decoupled from motion\nin the X\u2013Y plane and are not as unstable as that motion, our expectation was that these\noscillations could be controlled using maneuvers only in the probes\u2019 +Z directions, which\nwere close to ecliptic south for each probe; this proved to be the case for this oscillation\ncontrol (described earlier in this section) as well as for statistical Z control throughout the\nLissajous phase. The complete set of stationkeeping maneuvers for both probes is detailed\nin Tables 5 and 6.\n\n5.4 Lunar Orbit Phase Trajectories\n\nMost scientific observations for ARTEMIS occur during the lunar orbit phase, which nom-\ninally lasts 2 years. It was desirable for the lunar orbit to have apoapsis as high as possible\nin order to enable a large range of downstream lunar wake measurements. Another goal for\nthe mission was to maximize the number of periapses less than 50 km altitude in order to\nbest measure crustal magnetism and sputtered ions. Long orbit lifetimes and at least some\ninclination relative to the lunar equator would help to maximize the variety of measure-\nment opportunities. Considering also the spacecraft capabilities, the ARTEMIS lunar orbits\nwere chosen to have apoapsis radius around 19,000 km (driven by the maximum acceptable\neclipse duration) with periapsis altitudes varying between roughly 20 and 1200 km altitude.\nThe P1 orbit is retrograde with a lunar periapsis latitude range of \u00b112 deg and the P2 orbit\nis prograde with a periapsis latitude range of \u00b117 deg.\n\n81 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H.

Another longer term eccentricity oscillation\nis induced by the secular precession of the argument of periapsis caused by the Earth for the\nARTEMIS orbits (Scheeres et al. 2001). This oscillation causes periapsis altitudes to vary\nby a few hundred km every few months. The P1 and P2 periapsis altitudes through 2013\nclearly show the influence of these two oscillations (Fig. 12).\n\nAnother effect of Earth\u2019s perturbation on the orbits is to cause the ecliptic longitude of the\nperiapse for each orbit to change in the same direction as the orbital motion by about 100 deg\nper year. By putting the probes into opposing orbits, e.g., P2 prograde and P1 retrograde,\nthe relative motion of their lines of apsides is maximized. The combination of this apsidal\nmotion with the significant eccentricity of the orbits enables observations to be achieved at\n\n83 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H.

The approach trajectories from Lissajous orbit could not enter the science orbit\nwith a single lunar orbit insertion (LOI) maneuver because not enough ?V was available. It\nwas necessary to divide the insertion into many maneuvers to reduce the gravity and steering\nlosses to an acceptable level. The implemented transfer design consists of an LOI maneuver\nplus five period reduction maneuvers (PRMs) for each spacecraft. The geometries of the P1\nand P2 approaches from Lissajous and subsequent transfers to the science orbit are shown\nin Fig. 13. The timing and ?V of each maneuver, as executed, is given in Table 7.\n\nThe first steps toward achieving the science orbit were performed during the Lissajous\norbit phase. An out-of-plane component was included in SKMs in January and February\nof 2011 that set the inclination of approach to LOI such that an acceptable science orbit\ninclination could be achieved. This method of inclination modification is very fuel efficient\nrelative to a plane-change maneuver in lunar orbit.\n\nRelatively large LOI maneuvers with significant gravity losses were required to capture\nP1 and P2 into a low enough orbit so that Earth-gravity perturbations did not result in impact\n\nReprinted from the journal 84\n\n\n\nARTEMIS Mission Design\n\nFig. 13 LOI and low-lunar orbit trajectories for (a) P1 and (b) P2 in the rotating Moon-centered frame.

The geometry to the approach from Lissajous orbit determines\nthe initial phasing on the bi-weekly periapsis altitude oscillation and the magnitude of the\noscillation grows with the apoapsis altitude. The approach phase was effectively fixed due\nto dynamics and the future objective to coordinating measurements with LADEE. Thus,\nto avoid impact at the minimum of the oscillation cycle, the LOI altitude had to be high\nenough and LOI duration long enough to avoid a surface-impacting post-LOI orbit. The P1\nLOI altitude was selected to be 1850 km and the P2 LOI altitude was at 3800 km. At these\naltitudes, the minimum safe burn duration for LOI was 135 minutes for P1 and 173 minutes\nfor P2 with the roughly 0.5 N thrust available at the time of LOI (assuming use of a \u00b130 deg\npulse width). The P2 LOI duration was further increased to 205 minutes to improve the\neclipse phasing for the subsequent PRMs. Since the ARTEMIS thrust cannot be dynamically\nsteered along an anti-velocity direction without significant redesign of its thruster operations\nsoftware, the LOIs were divided into three constant-direction thrust segments in order to\nreduce steering losses; these segments were separated by a minimum of three minutes for\noperational reasons.\n\n85 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H. Sweetser et al.\n\nFig. 14 Time history of periapsis altitudes for P1 and P2 during the first 6 months in orbit. LOI and PRM\nmaneuver dates are marked as triangles. All maneuvers were roughly centered around periapsis with the\nexception of P1\u2019s PRM-3, which was at apoapsis\n\nAfter a safe capture orbit was achieved with the LOI maneuvers, the rest of the transition\nto the science orbits was achieved with a series of smaller and more efficient PRM burns.\nFor maximum fuel-efficiency, an infinite number of very small PRMs at periapses would be\nideal. For ARTEMIS, a total of 10 PRMs (5 for each spacecraft) were performed over a pe-\nriod of 5 months. PRMs were included on periapse numbers 3, 20, 28, and 49 and apoapsis\nnumber 22 for P1. For P2, PRMs were placed at periapse numbers 2, 20, 36, 47, and 63. The\nplacement of these PRM maneuvers relative to the bi-weekly periapsis altitude oscillation\nis shown in Fig. 14. A number of factors were considered in determining the placement and\nsizing of the PRM maneuvers including: ?V efficiency (using the lowest periapsis altitudes\nis most efficient), operations schedule (sufficient time for orbit determination, maneuver de-\nsign, and testing must exist between maneuvers), operations staff availability (P1 and P2\nactivities should not be simultaneous since a single team operates both spacecraft), orbit\nlifetime (should not be less than 14 days if a maneuver is missed), final stable orbit altitude\n(PRMs needed to manage periapsis altitudes to ensure a low altitude final orbit), eclipses\n(spacecraft cannot maneuver in eclipse and shadow times must be less that 4 hrs), occulta-\ntions (flight rules prohibit maneuver initialization when out of radio contact), and the per-\nformance of preceding PRMs (the PRM sequence design was modified as needed after each\nmaneuver execution). The total characteristic ?V expended for execution of the combined\nLOI and PRMs was 91.1 m/s for P1 and 118.4 m/s for P2, where characteristic ?V is the\n?V the thrusters would have provided if the spacecraft weren\u2019t spinning.

Periapse altitudes are affected by\nperturbations due to Earth\u2019s gravity so that they are lowest at constrained longitudes for P1 and P2. The lunar\norbits have been tuned to give good coverage of certain magnetic anomalies in the lunar crust (shown as\nshaded rectangles)\n\n5.4.2 Science measurement opportunities\n\nFigure 12 gives current predictions for the periapsis altitudes that are expected through the\nend of 2013. One of the most challenging aspects of the transfer to science orbit was max-\nimizing the number of sub-50 km periapses subject to mission and spacecraft constraints.\nThe science orbits that have been successfully achieved are such that the natural dynamics\nallow for a number of low periapsis opportunities. The absence of significant secular drift in\nthe periapsis altitude helps to minimize the maintenance ?V needed in the coming years to\navoid impact. Planetary-science enhancement burns (PEBs) are planned (but not finalized)\nto maintain the periapsis altitude as needed and, ultimately, to lower the apoapsis to increase\nthe number of periapses and reduce the altitude oscillation magnitude.\n\nThe science orbits were inclined from the lunar equator, and the periapses were, in part,\ndriven to be so low to allow for better measurements of crustal magnetic anomalies. Fig-\nure 15 shows the periapsis altitude and locations for both spacecraft relative to the lunar\nsurface. The colored boxes indicate the location of some known crustal magnetic anomalies.\nThe inclination oscillation and the secular movement of the argument of periapsis (Scheeres\net al. 2001) induced by the Earth\u2019s gravity allow for a range of periapsis latitudes at all\nlongitudes. Some of these periapses offer the opportunity for optimal crustal anomaly mea-\n\n87 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H.

Each red or blue point represents\nan orbit arc within or near the wake. These arcs vary in length and orientation\n\nsurements (i.e., sub-50 km altitude near an anomaly). Note that the dynamics dictate that\nmaximum periapsis latitudes are achieved only when inclination is at the minimum of its\noscillation cycle.\n\nA key heliophysics objective of the mission is to measure the lunar wake with the two\nspacecraft in a number of relative geometries over time. Figure 16 shows the range from the\nMoon\u2019s center in the anti-Sun direction of the lunar wake crossing observation opportunities\nfor the achieved ARTEMIS science orbits as a function of time. A large number of measure-\nments opportunities have been created due to the low orbit inclination (one opportunity per\norbit per spacecraft), large variety of down-Sun ranges (due to the orbit eccentricity), and\nrelative geometries (due to the orbit precession induced by the Earth).\n\n6 Mission Status\n\nAs of February, 2012, both P1 and P2 have successfully arrived into and maintained Lis-\nsajous orbits around the Earth-Moon L1 point, transitioned into lunar orbit insertions, and\nreduced their orbit periods into the science orbit. Both probes and their instruments are\nfunctioning normally. One minor surprise occurred on October 14, 2010, when a small,\nsudden change was observed in the velocity and spin rate of P1, which was quickly\ntraced to the loss of the EFI sensor ball at the end of one of the four EFI booms de-\nployed from the sides of the probe. This loss was originally attributed to a micromete-\norite severing the fine wire that connected the sensor ball to the preamp at the end of the\nboom (http://www.nasa.gov/mis-sion_pages/themis/news/artemis-struck.html), but then the\npreamp separated from the same boom on August 27, 2011. This suggests that in the earlier\nevent a micrometeorite impacted and weakened the connection between the boom and the\n\nReprinted from the journal 88\n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mis-sion_pages/themis/news/artemis-struck.html\n\n\nARTEMIS Mission Design\n\npreamp. In this scenario the shock of the impact at the other end of the preamp caused the\nfine wire to the sensor to break immediately, while thermal cycling and various mechanical\nstrains finally broke the preamp loose later (Owens et al. 2012).\n\nAlthough reduction in the number of EFI sensors will cause a slight reduction in the qual-\nity of the electric field measurements, the instrument still satisfies its science requirements.\nThe loss of the sensor mass also shifted the probe\u2019s center of mass, which has and will com-\nplicate operations somewhat, especially in the management of the propellant on board, and\naffect the mission design because side maneuvers now have a much larger (though still small\nin absolute terms at ?0.05 RPM per m/s) effect on the spin rate.\n\nTable 2 shows how the maneuver ?V s added up for all of the phases.\n\n7 Conclusions\n\nThe trajectory design of the ARTEMIS mission that began in July of 2009 has been pre-\nsented here. The design sent two probes from Earth orbit to the Moon via a transfer that\ntook ?2 years and involved numerous lunar approaches and flybys, low-energy trajectory\nlegs in the Earth-Sun system, and Lissajous orbits around the Earth-Moon Lagrange points\non either side of the Moon, and finally culminated with both probes in very eccentric low-\nlunar orbits. The constraints imposed on the design by the limitations of the THEMIS probes\n(which were designed for an Earth-orbiting mission)\u2014including thruster orientation, avail-\nable ?V , maximum shadow capability, maximum distance for radio telecommunication,\nand thruster capabilities\u2014necessitated an innovative design. Ultimately the design satisfied\nall mission constraints and offers a variety of scientific measurement opportunities that have\nthe potential to enhance understanding of Earth-Moon-Sun interactions.\n\nGiven the challenges that the ARTEMIS mission presented and the complexity of the\ndesign needed to meet those challenges, it is notable that the cost of the mission design\neffort was many times less than one would estimate for a new, i.e., non-extended, full mis-\nsion of comparable difficulty. One major difference is that ARTEMIS started in space with\ngiven orbits for the two probes, saving the significant cost of determining a launch period\nand optimal launch targets for the mission. But an even bigger factor in cost savings was\nacceptance of risk that is unacceptable for a more expensive mission. The THEMIS mis-\nsion was already a success and completely justified the investment already made in building\nand launching the probes. Furthermore, the outermost two probes were forced to find a new\nmission because the THEMIS orbits they were in would have led to fatal shadows by now.\nSo in a sense the only thing at risk was the cost of the ARTEMIS design itself, leading to a\nsituation where the investment at risk was reduced by accepting a higher probability that the\nrisk would be realized.\n\nThe primary cost-saving characteristic of the mission design process that put ARTEMIS\nat risk was the near absence of redundancy, both in the design process and in the products of\nthat process. There is a certain amount of natural redundancy in the use of two probes, and\nindeed much of the opportunity for new science could be realized even in the absence of one.\nA significant opportunity would have been missed, though, without the dual measurements\nthat have already been made by the two probes and that are planned for the remainder of the\nmission. On the ground, however, the design team was pared down so that at times it relied\non a single person; had that person been unavailable, a different and uncertain approach for\nthat part of the design would have been required. The limited team size also meant that the\ndesign itself was nearly \u201csingle string\u201d in the absence of backup and contingency trajecto-\nries. The analysis that would have produced such alternative designs was most often replaced\n\n89 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nT.H. Sweetser et al.\n\nby engineering judgment that such alternatives existed and could be found if needed. Simi-\nlarly, in the area of maneuver design, extensive Monte Carlo runs covering all the ways that\nreality could diverge from the nominal plan were replaced by experience-based estimates\nof when trajectory correction maneuvers might be needed and of how much ?V capability\nmight be needed to correct the trajectories as they were flown.\n\nThe greatest uncertainty in the design was perhaps in the area of trans-lunar trajectory\ncorrections because these could contain only minimal ?V components in the direction of\nthe probe ?Z axis. In one of the rare instances of backup analysis, an alternative transfer that\nincluded deterministic \u201cdown\u201d maneuvers at strategic points along the way was designed;\nthese maneuvers could serve to enable upward corrections by reducing the size of the down\nmaneuvers. But this alternative transfer was not used or needed, and the maneuver design\nteam was able to design TCMs in flight that kept the probes on track to their Lissajous ren-\ndezvous. The enabling mitigation of the probe\u2019s thrust-direction constraints was that every\nphase of the mission, including the transfer phase, included multiple orbits of the Earth or\nMoon so that an up maneuver on one side of the orbit could be replaced by a down maneuver\nor in some cases a radial maneuver elsewhere in the orbit. Another critical factor of mission\nsuccess so far has been the stellar performance of the two probes and the mission operations\nteam: every one of the dozens and dozens of maneuvers has been executed as planned.\n\nAcknowledgements The work described in this paper was carried out in part at the Jet Propulsion Labo-\nratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-\nistration.\n\nThe authors would like to recognize and compliment the outstanding contributions of the THEMIS/\nARTEMIS science team, the ARTEMIS mission design team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the ARTEMIS\nnavigation and maneuver design team at Goddard Space Flight Center, and the THEMIS/ARTEMIS navi-\ngation, maneuver design, and operations team at the University of California-Berkeley Space Science Lab-\noratory to the successful development and implementation (so far) of the ARTEMIS mission.

The characteris-\ntics of these distributions match expectations from self-similar models of plasma expansion\ninto vacuum, with an asymmetric character likely driven by a combination of a tilted in-\nterplanetary magnetic field and an anisotropic incident solar wind electron population. On\nthis flyby, ARTEMIS provided unprecedented measurements of the interpenetrating beams\nof both electrons and ions naturally produced by the filtration and acceleration effects of\nelectric fields set up during the refilling process.

These plasma inputs, which vary by orders of magnitude in velocity,\ndensity, and temperature, especially during active solar periods, drive a commensurately\nvariable Moon-plasma interface, which we have studied since the Apollo era (Ness 1972;\nSchubert and Lichtenstein 1974). Charged particle and photon impacts generate much of the\ntenuous lunar exosphere and play a role in its loss. They also drive highly variable surface\ncharging on both the sunlit and shadowed hemispheres of the Moon (Freeman et al. 1973;\nHalekas et al. 2008b). Relatively small and weak, but widely distributed, lunar crustal mag-\nnetic anomalies (Dyal et al. 1974) produce perhaps some of the smallest collisionless shocks\nand magnetospheres in the solar system (Russell and Lichtenstein 1975; Lin et al. 1998;\nHalekas et al. 2008a; Wieser et al. 2010; Saito et al. 2010). These and other elements of the\nplasma environment couple to the lunar surface and exosphere, and very likely to lunar dust,\nin ways not yet completely understood.\n\nThe lunar plasma wake exhibits a host of particularly fascinating physical processes.\nSolar wind ions impact the dayside lunar surface, implanting or scattering, and leaving a void\ndownstream from the Moon. The resulting plasma void has vanishingly low plasma density,\nand refills only slowly as solar wind ions flow at supersonic speeds past the Moon. The\npressure gradient across the wake boundary creates diamagnetic current systems that reduce\nthe magnetic field magnitude in the expansion region near the wake boundary and enhance\nthe field in the central wake (Colburn et al. 1967; Ness et al. 1967; Owen et al. 1996; Halekas\net al. 2005). Charged particles refill the wake along magnetic field lines, with the higher\nthermal speed of the electrons driving a charge-separation electric field that approximately\nmaintains quasi-neutrality while slowing electron expansion and accelerating ions into the\nwake. Theoretical studies and simulations of this general plasma process have shown that\nthis leads to a rarefaction wave propagating back into the plasma, particle expansion into\nthe vacuum with a velocity related to the ion sound speed, and an exponentially decreasing\ndensity on the vacuum side of the interface (Crow et al. 1975; Denavit 1979; Samir et al.\n1983). Observations from Wind first demonstrated that this process operates to refill the\nlunar wake (Ogilvie et al. 1996; Clack et al. 2004), and numerous simulations have since\nrefined our understanding (Farrell et al. 1998; Birch and Chapman 2001a, 2001b; Kallio\n2005; Tr\u00e1vnicek and Hellinger 2005; Kimura and Nakagawa 2008). More recently, we have\nlearned that ions can also refill the wake perpendicular to the magnetic field direction, with\ngyrating protons (Type-I entry) and re-picked up protons scattered from the dayside surface\n(Type-II entry) both capable of penetrating deep into the wake cavity (Nishino et al. 2009a,\n2009b; Holmstr\u00f6m et al. 2010). We do not yet fully understand the relative importance of\nparallel and perpendicular refilling processes in the wake, or how this varies as a function of\ndistance downstream from the Moon.\n\nMany open questions remain about the lunar plasma environment, and each mission\nto the Moon to date has made new discoveries that have changed our understanding of\n\nReprinted from the journal 94\n\n\n\nFirst Results from ARTEMIS, a New Two-Spacecraft Lunar Mission\n\nthe Moon-plasma interaction. The latest generation of international lunar missions, namely\nKaguya, Chandrayaan, and Chang\u2019E, observed many new phenomena, including magnetic\nshielding of surface regions (Saito et al. 2010; Wieser et al. 2010), solar wind scattering\nfrom the dayside surface (Saito et al. 2008; Wieser et al. 2009), gyrating and re-picked up\nscattered protons refilling the wake (Nishino et al. 2009a, 2009b), and scattered protons in-\nteracting with the wake electric field (Nishino et al. 2009a; Wang et al. 2010). Even now,\nmany components of the lunar plasma environment remain either incompletely understood\nor unobserved.\n\nGiven the opportunity to add to our understanding of this fascinating environment, we re-\ntasked two of the probes from the THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interac-\ntions During Substorms) five-spacecraft magnetospheric constellation mission (Angelopou-\nlos 2008) on an extended mission to the Moon, as a new lunar mission named ARTEMIS\n(Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of the Moon\u2019s Interaction\nwith the Sun). These comprehensively instrumented spacecraft, currently in transition or-\nbits, will eventually enter into elliptical orbits around the Moon, providing unprecedented\ntwo-point measurements over a range of altitudes from ?100\u201310,000 km, with a variety of\norbital phasings and probe separations. In this paper, we describe observations from the first\nlunar flyby through the lunar wake by ARTEMIS P1 (formerly THEMIS-B).\n\n2 Overview of the Feb 13, 2010 ARTEMIS Flyby\n\nThe first flyby of the lunar wake by ARTEMIS P1 took place on February 13, 2010. We\nshow observations from several of the ARTEMIS instruments in Fig. 1, and an overview\nof the geometry of the flyby in Fig. 2. The spacecraft passed through the plasma wake\n?3.5 lunar radii (RM = 1738 km) downstream from the Moon, in a region between those\nobserved by Wind and the more recent low-altitude Lunar Prospector, Kaguya, Chang\u2019E,\nand Chandrayaan missions. The GSE position of the Moon was roughly [62.2,?8.7,2.5]\nearth radii, well upstream from the terrestrial magnetosphere and certainly not connected to\nthe terrestrial foreshock, given the large z-component of the magnetic field. The ARTEMIS\nP1 probe traveled through the wake at an oblique angle, with the orbit trajectory fortuitously\naligned nearly along the prevailing magnetic field direction. This afforded us an excellent\nopportunity to measure parallel wake expansion processes along magnetic field lines. The\ncombination of unfavorable non-perpendicular magnetic field geometry and distance from\nthe Moon apparently precluded us from seeing any effects of Type-I proton gyration entry\nor Type-II pickup entry perpendicular to field lines (Nishino et al. 2009a, 2009b).\n\nIon observations by the ESA instrument (McFadden et al. 2008) indicate bi-directional\npenetration of ions into the wake along magnetic field lines, with roughly exponentially\ndecreasing density in the wake, bounded by an external rarefaction wave, as predicted by\nmodels of plasma expansion into vacuum (Samir et al. 1983) and previously observed by\nWind (Ogilvie et al. 1996). The characteristic energy loss/gain of the ions on the entry/exit\nsides of the wake results from ion acceleration along tilted magnetic field lines, which sub-\ntracts/adds to the solar wind velocity on the entry/exit sides, as clearly seen in the velocity\ncomponents. We discuss ion observations further in Sect. 4.\n\nDuring this first wake flyby, the ESA instrument operated in magnetospheric mode (Mc-\nFadden et al. 2008), allowing full energy and angular coverage of ions, but with reduced\nresolution (22.5? angular resolution, 32% fractional energy resolution). In this mode, the\ninstrument can underestimate the magnitude of the solar wind ion density due to the slower\nenergy sweep, and the transverse components of the ion velocity can have small errors be-\ncause of the reduced angular resolution. Nonetheless, we have compared integrated ion and\n\n95 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nJ.S. Halekas et al.\n\nFig. 1 ARTEMIS observations of the lunar plasma wake on Feb 13, 2010.

Future flybys with the ESA instru-\nments in solar wind mode will provide higher resolution measurements of the distributions\nof solar wind ions as they refill the wake.\n\nIn sunlight, the EFI instrument (Bonnell et al. 2008) measures the spacecraft potential\n(see Fig. 1), allowing us to correct for the effects of spacecraft charging. Just inside the\nplasma wake (as indicated by the reduction in plasma density, indicating the extent of the\nrarefaction wave), but outside of the Moon\u2019s penumbra, EFI observes an increase in space-\ncraft potential resulting from the reduction in plasma density. Inside the Moon\u2019s penumbra,\nwe tested a new biasing scheme for the EFI probes, with the aim of controlling the space-\ncraft potential. This biasing scheme successfully moderated spacecraft charging, resulting in\na spacecraft potential of approximately two volts positive, as derived from comparison of ion\nand electron density and velocity moments. This small and well-estimated spacecraft poten-\ntial allows us to correct for spacecraft charging even in the shadowed wake region, providing\na critically important capability for quantitatively analyzing charged particle observations.\n\nReprinted from the journal 96\n\n\n\nFirst Results from ARTEMIS, a New Two-Spacecraft Lunar Mission\n\nFig. 2 Geometry of the Feb 13,\n2010 ARTEMIS wake flyby, in\naberrated SSE coordinates,\nassuming a perfectly cylindrical\nlunar wake extended in the\ndirection of the aberrated solar\nwind flow. We color code the\nspacecraft track by the log of the\nion density, and show magnetic\nfield vectors at the times\nindicated\n\nTo demonstrate this capability, we display electron spectra corrected for the effects of space-\ncraft charging in Fig. 1, showing a smoothly varying spectrum as a function of time, with\nno artificial discontinuities at the light/shadow boundaries. Between the penumbra and the\numbra, the spacecraft potential changed rapidly, and we did not attempt to correct these elec-\ntron spectra (blank regions in electron spectrogram in Fig. 1). Electrons, like ions, drop out\nas the spacecraft travels deeper into the wake, leaving only a residual halo/strahl population\nin the central wake. We discuss electron observations further in Sect. 5.\n\nEFI also measures the electric field component of plasma waves. During this flyby, as\nshown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1, EFI observed electric field oscillations extending almost\nup to the electron plasma frequency, primarily on the exit side of the wake. During this same\ntime period, we observed no magnetic field fluctuations with the SCM instrument (Roux\net al. 2008), identifying these oscillations as primarily electrostatic. We discuss possible\nsources for these waves further in Sect. 5.\n\nThe FGM instrument (Auster et al. 2008) measured the vector magnetic field. In shadow,\nthe spacecraft loses the sun pulse, and its spin period drifts slightly due to thermal effects.\n\n97 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nJ.S.

Dashed lines show\nthe extent of the plasma wake as\nindicated by ion density\n\nThe FGM team has utilized magnetic field data, along with modeling of the thermal con-\ntraction of the spacecraft, to derive the actual spacecraft spin period in shadow, allowing\nus to correctly de-spin both magnetic field and plasma data. Magnetic field data thus cor-\nrected indicate a highly variable field orientation, but with a prevailing alignment between\nthe magnetic field and the spacecraft trajectory, as shown in Fig. 2. Though we do observe\nseveral large rotations in the field, we cannot convincingly associate any of these with the\nwake boundary. We discuss magnetic field observations in more detail in Sect. 2.\n\nWe use the solar wind VX component measured by ESA, along with the ?30 km/s veloc-\nity of the Earth around the Sun, to derive an approximate aberration angle for the solar wind.\nThe VY component measured by ESA roughly matches the expected aberration; however,\nESA also measures a small VZ component that we have not utilized in the aberration cal-\nculation. As noted above, transverse velocity components measured by ESA can have small\nerrors in magnetospheric mode due to the low angular resolution of the binning scheme.\nWe found that including only the VY component provided a better match to the observa-\ntions, with the ion density dropout that indicates the extent of the plasma wake matching the\nresulting assumed wake geometry.\n\n3 Magnetic Field Observations\n\nARTEMIS FGM data indicate a highly variable magnetic field during this time period. In\nparticular, we observe large rotations in the field just before and after the wake transit. One\nwould like to associate these with the wake itself, but we would first have to rule out up-\nstream influences to make such a claim. In Fig. 3, we compare Wind and ARTEMIS mag-\nnetic field data. We use the radial separation of the two spacecraft of 133 earth radii and the\nradial solar wind velocity measured at Wind of 320 km/s to derive an approximate time shift\nof 2650 s, which we apply to the Wind data. With this time shift, we find that Wind observes\nessentially all of the magnetic field signatures that ARTEMIS does, with very similar timing.\nThus, all of the field rotations have a source far upstream from the Moon.\n\nA comparison of the magnitude of the field between the two spacecraft does yield some\ninteresting differences. For instance, ARTEMIS observes much more significant reductions\n\nReprinted from the journal 98\n\n\n\nFirst Results from ARTEMIS, a New Two-Spacecraft Lunar Mission\n\nFig. 4 Ion spectrogram\n[eV/(cm2 s sr eV)] (high\nresolution burst data), and a\nseries of two-component fits to\nthe reduced ion distribution\nfunction. \u201cA/P\u201d indicates time\nperiods with distributions best fit\nto an alpha particle plus a proton\ncomponent, \u201c2xP\u201d indicates a\ntime period with distributions\nbest fit to two proton\ncomponents, and \u201cNo Fits\u201d\nindicates a time period with no\nsuccessful two-component fits.\nRed, orange, blue, and black\ncurves on both panels show\nmodeled proton and alpha\nparticle energies and velocities,\nas labeled in the figure\n\nin field magnitude associated with the large rotations just before and after the wake pas-\nsage. These magnetic field depressions could represent the expected diamagnetic dips in\nfield magnitude in the expansion region of the wake. However, given their co-location with\nrotations also observed upstream, we do not favor such an interpretation. To make such a\nclaim, one would have to clearly separate temporal from spatial variations, requiring more\nthan one set of observations, preferably with both observations near the Moon. Furthermore,\nwe find no significant increase in magnetic field magnitude in the central wake, an expected\nresult of the diamagnetic current systems. Therefore, we cannot convincingly associate any\nmagnetic field features seen during this wake passage with a lunar origin. In the coming\nyears, many orbits from two identically instrumented ARTEMIS probes will allow us to sort\nout features associated with the Moon-plasma interaction from those generated upstream,\nand separate spatial from temporal variations.\n\n4 Ion Observations and Model Comparisons\n\nAs discussed briefly in Sect. 2, ARTEMIS ESA data indicate ions accelerated along mag-\nnetic field lines into the wake from both sides. In Fig. 4, we show high-resolution ESA\nburst data for ions during the wake passage. We also display velocity magnitudes derived\nfrom two-component fits (using a gradient-expansion method with a chi square fit metric)\nto the reduced ion distribution function. This fitting procedure allows a separation of ion\nspecies and velocity components difficult to achieve self-consistently in a moment calcula-\ntion with an instrument like ESA that does not have mass separation. Outside of the wake\nin the undisturbed solar wind, these fits indicate that proton and alpha particle velocities\ntrack very well, as expected. Inside the wake, though, the spectrograms and fits in Fig. 4\nindicate the presence of proton and alpha particle components from both sides of the wake,\nwith a complicated spectral structure that we can only fit to a two-component spectrum in a\nfew regions. Wind and other spacecraft have observed accelerated protons like these refill-\ning the wake (Ogilvie et al. 1996), and interpreted them as the result of charge-separation\nelectric fields produced during the expansion process (Samir et al. 1983), but no one to our\nknowledge has previously observed alpha particle expansion into the lunar wake.\n\n99 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nJ.S. Halekas et al.\n\nAbsent any other information, we would have a difficult time separating the four compo-\nnents of the ion distribution function, composed of interpenetrating protons and alphas from\nboth sides of the wake. However, a model helps us identify the various ion components. As-\nsuming a quasi-neutral 1-D expansion of isothermal plasma into a vacuum, one can derive\nso-called self-similar expansion relations (Denavit 1979; Samir et al. 1983), which depend\nonly on the combination s/t , where s represents the distance along the magnetic field line\ninto the vacuum, and t the expansion time (or, equivalently, the solar wind convection time\npast the lunar limb). In all equations, Cs represents the ion sound speed.\n\nN = N0 exp(?(s/(Cst) + 1)) (1)\n? = ?(Te/e)(s/(Cst) + 1) (2)\nVi = s/t + Cs (3)\n\nOne can extend these relations to take into account non-Maxwellian electron distribu-\ntions, with the effect of slightly increasing the potential and velocity in the wake. Lunar\nProspector observed electron distributions inside and outside the wake at low altitudes,\nand derived electron properties and wake potentials consistent with this expanded theory\n(Halekas et al. 2005). Recent observations from Chandrayaan also show that this model may\nneed some modifications near the Moon to take into account surface absorption of plasma\n(Futaana et al. 2010). For this case, though, we opt to use the most basic self-similar model,\ndemonstrating how well even very simple theory matches ARTEMIS observations.\n\nTo develop our model prediction, we use spacecraft position and magnetic field data in\naberrated SSE coordinates (as shown in Fig. 2) in order to calculate the convection time t\nof the point where the magnetic field line intersects the wake boundary, and the distance\ns along the field line into the wake from that point. Our model depends on the instanta-\nneous magnetic field geometry, and thereby captures the asymmetry of the wake due to the\ntilted magnetic field. Though one-dimensional in nature, the model implicitly captures two-\ndimensional features, since convection time maps to distance downstream from the Moon.\nOur model, utilizing the measured solar wind speed of 310 km/s and an ion sound speed\nCs of 25 km/s derived from the measured electron temperature Te of ?6.5 eV, has no ad-\njustable parameters. Finally, we employ an extension of the self-similar model for alpha\nparticle behavior derived by Singh and Schunk (1982) for polar wind, which assumes that\nthe small fraction of alpha particles do not affect the potential, but rather merely respond to\nit. Note that this implies that alpha particles sense a different potential than protons, since the\ntwo species travel at different velocities into the wake through an explicitly time dependent\npotential, and therefore we can think of the wake as filtering particles of different species.\n\nWe add the model expansion velocity determined for both protons and alpha particles to\nthe initial solar wind velocity in vector fashion to derive the modeled total energies and ve-\nlocities, which we plot over the data in Fig. 4. Our simple model matches the measured ion\nenergy spectra and two-component velocity fits rather well, correctly reproducing the asym-\nmetry of the wake, and the decrease/increase in energy and velocity on the entry/exit sides\nof the wake. The model even accurately reproduces numerous small temporal fluctuations\n(departures from a temporally smoothly varying spectrum) in the ion spectra that result from\nchanges in the magnetic field geometry. This indicates that the infilling ions closely follow\nthe instantaneous magnetic field orientation, as expected given the solar wind convection\ntime of only ?15\u201320 seconds from the Moon to the spacecraft. With the aid of our model,\nwe can now clearly separate different components of the ion spectrum. We find that protons\nand alphas from both sides penetrate nearly all the way through the wake, with only the al-\npha component from the entry side proving difficult to identify in the ion spectrogram. In the\n\nReprinted from the journal 100\n\n\n\nFirst Results from ARTEMIS, a New Two-Spacecraft Lunar Mission\n\nFig. 5 The top two panels show the cylindrical coordinates of the spacecraft and the closest point to the\ncenter of the wake reached by the magnetic field line passing through the spacecraft (using a straight-line\napproximation). The third and fourth panels show corrected spectrograms [eV/(cm2 s sr eV)] for parallel\n(0\u201315? pitch angle) and anti-parallel (165\u2013180?) traveling electrons (high resolution burst data). The fifth and\nsixth panels show the wake potential relative to the solar wind, and the potential drop from the deepest point\ninto the wake along the magnetic field line to the spacecraft, as inferred from shifts in electron distribution\nfunctions. Black curves on both panels indicate model potentials. The bottom two panels show synthetic\nspectrograms created using the inferred potentials and four end-point electron spectra, as described in the text\n\ncentral wake, at least three, and probably four, populations of ions coexist simultaneously,\neach with slightly different vector velocities as a result of the different electric fields felt\nby the various populations. This promises a rich plasma environment, with a strong likeli-\nhood of wave-particle interactions, possibly including beam-beam instabilities as postulated\nby Farrell et al. (1998). In the coming years, ARTEMIS\u2019s full plasma instrumentation and\ntwo-probe measurement capability will enable statistical study and clear identification of the\neffects of interpenetrating ions on the wake environment.\n\n5 Electron Observations and Model Comparisons\n\nAs described in Sect. 2, ARTEMIS ESA data show that the bulk of the electron population\ndrops out in the central wake, leaving a residual population sufficient only to balance the\nsmall density of interpenetrating refilling ions. The electrons that do penetrate the wake,\nespecially the most field-aligned populations thereof, have fascinating properties. The third\nand fourth panels of Fig. 5 show two electron spectrograms calculated for parallel and anti-\nparallel components of the electron population, utilizing high resolution burst data, with both\n\n101 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nJ.S. Halekas et al.\n\ncorrected for spacecraft charging as described in Sect. 2. The potential drop set up by the\nwake refilling process (described in Sects. 3 and 4) excludes most of the lower-energy core\nelectron populations from both entry and exit sides of the wake, though a residual portion of\nthe core population penetrates to the central wake from the entry side. Meanwhile, a strong\nstrahl component travels anti-parallel along the field lines, penetrating all the way through\nthe wake from the exit side and traveling out the entry side. Finally, we find a beam of\nelectrons that travels out from the center of the wake parallel to the field line, and out of the\nexit side of the wake. ARTEMIS observes this exiting beam of electrons for some time after\nthe wake passage, whenever the magnetic field connects to the central wake.\n\nThe top two panels of Fig. 5 show that the energy of this exiting beam correlates well with\nthe proximity with which the magnetic field line at the spacecraft passes near the center of\nthe wake (as estimated by a linear extrapolation of the local magnetic field direction), rather\nthan with the position of the spacecraft itself, suggesting an origin related to the center of the\nwake. This beam of electrons may therefore have a source in the central wake, with the seed\npopulation then undergoing acceleration outwards by the wake electric field. However, the\nasymmetry of the wake clearly affects the source and/or evolution of the out-going beam,\nsince we do not observe a similar beam on the entry side of the wake.\n\nWe can infer the wake potential structure by comparing the field-aligned components\nof the electron distribution function in the wake with those measured outside the wake,\nas demonstrated previously using Nozomi and Lunar Prospector data (Futaana et al. 2001;\nHalekas et al. 2005). We use a parallel electron distribution function measured just outside\nthe entry side of the wake (at 08:36), and an anti-parallel distribution function measured just\noutside the exit side of the wake (at 09:43), as references to calculate shifts in parallel/anti-\nparallel electron spectra from the entry/exit sides of the wake to the center of the wake.\nTo accomplish this determination, we use electrons with energies from 40\u2013200 eV (which\npenetrate all the way through the wake) as tracer populations to derive the potential drop into\nthe wake. This procedure tacitly assumes that the source spectrum of solar wind electrons\ndoes not change significantly during the observation time period.\n\nThe fifth panel of Fig. 5 shows the results of this derivation, along with a model potential\ncomputed from the same self-similar model described in Sect. 4, with exactly the same\nparameters previously used. The model and data agree rather well, with small fluctuations\nin the derived potential indicating spatial and/or temporal variations not represented in the\nmodel. We find only one major difference from the model, namely an asymmetry between\nthe potential drop derived on the entry and exit sides of the wake. The wake potential may\nplausibly have a real spatial asymmetry, since the refilling electron populations from the\ntwo ends of the flux tube have different properties, and the wake isolates the two ends of\nthe flux tube from each other. The strong strahl population incident on the exit side of the\nwake very likely affects the plasma expansion, increasing the wake potential drop compared\nto that on the entry side, particularly deeper in the wake where the strahl dominates the\nelectron density. Alternatively, this asymmetry could result from temporal changes during\nthe wake traverse. Only two-point measurements, which ARTEMIS will provide in coming\nyears, can settle this question conclusively, but we find strong hints that point towards the\nformer interpretation.\n\nBy using electron distribution functions from the center of the wake (at 09:08) as refer-\nences, we can similarly approximately derive the potential drop sensed by electrons trav-\neling outwards from the central wake. This spectral shift depends on the potential drop\nbetween the local plasma and the deepest point in the wake on the magnetic field line of the\nspacecraft, rather than that between the solar wind and the local plasma, with our deriva-\ntion assuming temporal invariance and a constant electron spectrum throughout the central\n\nReprinted from the journal 102\n\n\n\nFirst Results from ARTEMIS, a New Two-Spacecraft Lunar Mission\n\nFig. 6 Schematic illustration of\nvelocity filtration of the electron\nspectrum by the wake potential,\nshowing distribution functions (at\nthree points) and trajectories of\ncore electrons, reflected core\nelectrons, and strahl electrons\n\nwake. Using these procedures, we can use electron distributions as a probe not only of the\nlocal wake potential, but that deeper in the wake along the spacecraft magnetic field line. As\nabove, we compare derived potential drops with the results of our self-similar model, in the\nsixth panel of Fig. 5. Again, the derived potential drops agree fairly well with our model,\nexcept that the model potential drop on the entry side exceeds the actual drop sensed by elec-\ntrons traveling out from that side of the wake. This implies a potential drop on the entry side\nof the wake smaller than expected, and smaller than that on the exit side, consistent with the\nresults just discussed. This asymmetry could explain the lack of a clearly observable beam\nof electrons traveling outward from the entry side of the wake.\n\nAs a final check on our inferred potential structure, we derive synthetic spectrograms for\nparallel and anti-parallel electrons, using the same end-point spectra we used to derive the\npotentials just discussed. We manufacture these synthetic spectrograms by constructing a su-\nperposition of incident electrons, reflected electrons, and electrons accelerated out from the\ncentral wake, again using the potential drops derived above to shift the distribution functions\nappropriately. The resulting superposed spectra match the observed distributions very well,\nother than small fluctuations likely due to temporal variations. The synthetic spectrograms,\nbased on derived potentials that rely only on measurements above 40 eV, also match the\nlower energy electrons, with the same basic features as the observed spectrograms. Further-\nmore, we find that the beam of electrons observed on the exit side of the wake matches very\nwell with the electron spectrum measured in the central wake, shifted by the inferred poten-\ntial drop from the central wake to the observation point. In other words, this exiting beam\nmost likely consists of a residual population of core/halo electrons that penetrates through\nthe central wake from the entry side and then undergoes acceleration outwards by the wake\npotential on the exit side. In some regions, this exiting beam co-exists with a reflected pop-\nulation of incident electrons with energies below the beam energy.\n\nIn Fig. 6, we show a schematic illustration of the tentatively identified components of the\nelectron spectra in and around the wake, produced by the filtering and acceleration effects\nof the wake potential. A small portion of the electron core population traveling parallel\nalong the magnetic field from the entry side of the wake penetrates to the central wake,\nwhere it feels the electric field set up by the plasma refilling the wake from the exit side,\nand undergoes acceleration outwards through the wake potential, producing the observed\nbeam. At the same time, few core electrons penetrate from the exit side, but a strong strahl\n\n103 Reprinted from the journal\n\n\n\nJ.S.

In Fig. 7, we show\ncorresponding measured distribution function cuts, demonstrating a striking agreement to\nthose postulated in Fig. 6. The measured spectra naturally show more complexity than the\ncartoon illustrations, with multiple spectral components (core and halo populations) visible\nin both the parallel and anti-parallel cuts. However, the key features remain, including the\nanti-parallel strahl enhancement, the residual parallel core population in the central wake,\nand the parallel beam formed by the acceleration of this residual population out of the wake.\nThe superposition of these various electron populations plausibly explains all of the features\nwe observe in the electron spectrograms, with no need to postulate any significant temporal\nvariations, though we cannot rule out temporal variations without two-point measurements\n(which we will soon have with ARTEMIS). A key element of the explanation presented\nhere relies on the asymmetric character of the wake, ensured naturally by the magnetic field\nline tilt and the different electron distributions incident on the wake from the entry and exit\nsides. We find it fascinating to speculate on what happens at the boundary between flux tubes\nconnected to the wake and those not connected to the wake, given the possible presence of an\nasymmetric potential, in addition to differential electron/ion shadowing (Bale et al. 1997),\neach of which may drive instabilities.\n\nThe wake potential first filters incident solar wind electron distributions and then re-\naccelerates them, naturally producing electron beams exiting the wake. Previous studies\nhave suggested the existence of such filtered distributions, based on observations of wave\nturbulence outside of the wake (Farrell et al. 1996; Nakagawa et al. 2003). We now have the\nfirst direct observations of the electron distributions that could drive such upstream waves.\nThese electron beams can also drive local wave processes in the wake, as can the counter-\nstreaming refilling ion beams. Indeed, EFI measures both broadband electrostatic noise in\nthe central wake, and electrostatic waves near the electron plasma frequency on the exit side\nof the wake (see Fig. 1). Either ions or electrons may generate the broadband turbulence\nin the central wake, with previous predictions suggesting a role for the ions (Farrell et al.\n1998). The higher frequency oscillations on the exit side of the wake, on the other hand,\ncorrelate very well with the exiting electron beam, suggesting that the beam and the oppo-\n\nReprinted from the journal 104\n\n\n\nFirst Results from ARTEMIS, a New Two-Spacecraft Lunar Mission\n\nsitely directed strahl electrons generate waves through a streaming instability. We observe\nthese waves at a frequency slightly below the electron plasma frequency, consistent with the\ndownshift expected when beam components comprise a significant fraction of the plasma\ndensity (Fuselier et al. 1985). Outside of the wake, core electrons may help damp wave\ngrowth, but inside the wake, where the incoming strahl and the exiting beam dominate the\nelectron density, strong wave growth can generate the observed electrostatic oscillations.\nBirch and Chapman (2001a, 2001b) predicted just such electrostatic oscillations, which we\nhave now observed with ARTEMIS. In the coming years, ARTEMIS will provide many\nmore detailed observations of the wave-particle interactions created by the filtration effects\nof the wake potential.\n\n6 Conclusions\n\nOn the first of many orbits, from one of two ARTEMIS probes, we have already made new\nand exciting observations of interpenetrating electron, proton, and alpha particle populations\nrefilling the wake from both flanks. The wake potential driven by the refilling process fil-\nters and accelerates both ions and electrons, naturally producing unstable distributions that\nshould generate numerous instabilities, including the electrostatic turbulence observed on\nthis orbit. Single-point measurements already suggest the presence of significant asymme-\ntries in the wake, resulting from tilted magnetic fields and anisotropic solar wind electron\ndistributions. Soon, ARTEMIS\u2019s two-probe measurement capability will allow us to conclu-\nsively separate temporal and spatial effects, and determine the causal flow of many processes\nhinted at in these observations. ARTEMIS\u2019s comprehensive instrumentation and elliptical\norbits will also allow investigations of the 3d structure and dynamics of the wake and many\nother aspects of the lunar plasma environment, including pickup ions from the exosphere\nand surface, magnetic anomaly interactions, surface electric fields, and no doubt many as\nyet unanticipated plasma processes. ARTEMIS will also support and complement measure-\nments from other current and planned missions such as LADEE, ILN, and LRO, providing\nan integral part of the lunar constellation.\n\nAcknowledgements We wish to acknowledge the extraordinary team of scientists and engineers that made\nthe THEMIS/ARTEMIS missions a reality.
