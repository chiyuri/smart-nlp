Instead a brief\nreview of some of the primary application of satellite remote sensing to the atmosphere will be\nprovided.\n\n8.1 CLOUD REMOTE SENSING\nOne of the prime atmospheric elements that can be sensed by satellites is clouds. For many Earth\nsurface applications clouds are merely a hindrance as reflected and emitted thermal radiation do not\npass through clouds, but clouds are prime indicators of conditions of the atmosphere. Clouds are\nrelated to the atmospheric elements (gases and aerosols) that make them up, and they will be addressed\nseparately.\n\n8.1.1 CLOUD TOP TEMPERATURE\nAccurate cloud top temperature and height information is very important for aviation forecasting and\nfor early warning of thunderstorm development. For optically thick clouds, weather satellite imagery\nprovides a reasonable estimate of cloud top temperature. Atmospheric absorption above the cloud may\nbe neglected and the brightness temperature of a thermal window channel can be taken as the ther-\nmodynamic cloud top temperature. In the case of semitransparent cloudiness, the direct use of the\nmeasured thermal brightness temperature will lead to a significant overestimation of the true cloud top\ntemperature resulting in a substantial underestimation of the cloud height.\n\nCloud top temperatures are first retrieved assuming that all clouds are black bodies. During the\ndaytime when visible radiances of a cloud are available to estimate cloud optical thickness trans-\nmissive cloud are corrected for the radiance transmitted from below through the cloud deck thus\ndecreasing cloud top temperature and subsequently increasing cloud height. At nighttime, however,\nsemitransparent cirrus clouds (high ice clouds) may be falsely identified as mid-level clouds due to the\nlack of visible information to estimate cloud optical thickness.\n\nThe advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) derived cloud heights have been\ncompared with coincident measures of cloud top temperature from the TIROS Operational Vertical\nSounder (TOVS). These cloud heights were found to agree quite well (Stubenrauch et al., 2005) in\nspite of their very different spatial resolutions. Both products show that the average cloud height of\nhigh clouds (cloud pressure less than 440 kPa) is largest in the tropics, due to a higher tropopause and\nthat in these regions there are nearly no general cloud systems with the highest cloud layer being in the\n\nCHAPTER\n\nIntroduction to Satellite Remote Sensing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809254-5.00008-7\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes are mostly covered by low-level clouds.\nRegional and seasonal distributions of bulk microphysical properties of large-scale semitransparent\ncirrus clouds obtained from the revised TOVS data have been published by Ra?del et al. (2003) and\nStubenrauch et al. (2005).\n\nCloud top temperatures are indicators to forecasters if a storm is getting stronger or weaker. When\ncloud top temperatures get colder it means that the cloud is getting higher in the atmosphere, reflecting\nthe uplift of warm moist air, and a stronger thunderstorm will form with a potential for cyclonic\nbehavior, and potentially a tornado. Cloud top temperatures that warm up indicate that the cloud tops\nare lower than they were, reflecting a weakening of the storm.\n\nWhen NASA\u2019s AQUA satellite passed over the Malacca island on September 23, 2010, the\nAtmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument measured the temperature of the cloud tops in the\nstorm colder than 215K in the strongest parts of the storm (Fig. 8.1).\n\nThese cloud top temperatures indicate that the storm has a lot of energy. Coincident thermal\ninfrared MODIS imagery showed an eye with thunderstorms banding around it, and convection\nrebuilding over the system reflecting strengthening of the system. Malacca had maximum sustained\nwinds near 113 km/h (just under Typhoon strength).\n\nSimilar cloud top temperatures were computed from AQUA\u2019s MODIS instrument (Fig. 8.2) for a\nregion in the Gulf of Mexico where a storm was just making landfall in Louisiana and Mississippi.\nOnly the coldest cloud top temperatures have been colored in this image showing that there are smaller\npockets of cold cloud tops following the inflow region of the storm. It should be noted that the\ntemperature given in the temperature scale below the image are in Kelvin to provide an absolute\ntemperature reference. This storm has the coldest cloud top temperatures in the center of the main\nstorm with similar low temperatures in some storm cells located in the outflow streamer to the south of\nthe main storm center. Only the lower temperature cloud tops have been colored while the rest of the\ninfrared field is left in gray shades. This image of the cloud top temperatures gives a good indication of\nwhere the storm is stronger.\n\nFIGURE 8.1\n\nTropical storm over the Malacca island from AQUA/AIRS on September 23, 2010.\n\n598 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nAn 8-year average cloud top temperature computed from MODIS on NASA\u2019s Terra satellite is\npresented here in Fig. 8.3 as generated by the MODAP system at the Goddard Space Flight Center\n(GSFC). From the color bar at the bottom of the image it is clear that none of these smoothed cloud\ntops are as cold as those seen in the storm in Fig. 8.2. The warmest clouds are located in the subtropics\nand mid-latitudes. The coldest cloud tops are found in the polar-regions. There is an interesting band of\ncooler cloud tops near the equator in the oceans. This is a fairly narrow band in the eastern Pacific and\nis a bit wider, but weaker in the Atlantic. In the eastern Indian Ocean and western Pacific this region is\nmuch larger meridionally and colder. This band could be associated with the Intertropical Convergence\nZone (ITCZ), which is a well-known location of strong convective activity. In general cloud tops over\nthe land are cooler than over the ocean reflecting the differential heating between land and ocean.\n\nAnother workhorse imager, the AVHRR, can also be used to estimate cloud top temperature. Here\nFig. 8.4 presents the cloud top temperatures computed from an AVHRR image for hurricane Andrew.\nThe cloud top temperatures are given by the color bar in the upper left of the image. Note that the\nbackground temperatures are all fairly uniform as shown by the red color. It is interesting that the eye\nof the hurricane shows the same red color and reflects the background conditions and not the storm.\nThis is a well-known characteristic of hurricanes.\n\nFIGURE 8.2\n\nAQUA 11 mm MODIS cloud top temperatures from September 3, 2011, over the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n8.1 CLOUD REMOTE SENSING 599\n\n\n\nGeostationary satellites can also be used to compute cloud top temperatures from their infrared\nchannels. A visible image (left) and the corresponding cloud top temperatures (right) from the Eu-\nropean Meteosat satellite are shown in Fig. 8.5. Note the row of small cloud patches along the equator\nthat all correspond to fairly cold cloud top temperatures seen here in blue (w220K). Similar cold cloud\ntops are seen over the central part of South Africa, the Western Africa, and in the Polar Regions. Warm\ncloud temperatures surrounding these cold spots on the equator are shown in the figure. There are\nwisps of fairly warm clouds over South Africa and in the central Atlantic. Medium temperature clouds\ncover most of the North Atlantic. The South Atlantic exhibits very low cloud cover with many regions\nbeing completely cloud-free. Moderate cloud top temperatures dominate the area over Europe.\n\n8.1.2 CLOUD SHAPE AND CLOUD TYPE\nClouds are classified according to their shape, height, content, and formation mechanism. A good\nsummary of the cloud types is provided here in Fig. 8.6.\n\nCumulus clouds are often called \u201cfair weather\u201d clouds as they occur generally over land on sunny\ndays when solar heating creates thermal convection currents. This explains the \u201cpuffy\u201d shape of these\nclouds. These clouds are found typically between 0.6 and 0.9 km altitude. They occur worldwide\n\nFIGURE 8.3\n\nTerra MODIS daytime cloud top temperature (K) February 2000eMay 2007.\n\n600 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nFIGURE 8.5\n\nVisible image (left) and cloud top temperatures (right) from Meteosat.\n\nFIGURE 8.4\n\nAVHRR derived cloud top temperatures for hurricane Andrew, June 30, 2010.\n\n8.1 CLOUD REMOTE SENSING 601\n\n\n\nexcept in Antarctica where it is too cold. They are liquid water clouds and are formed by thermal\nconvection currents.\n\nCumulonimbus clouds are the towering thunderclouds that strike fear into many who see them. As\nsuggested in Fig. 8.6 the top of this tower spreads out reflecting the stronger winds at these higher\nelevations. To form, there are three critical conditions: (1) a ready supply of warm, moist air, which\nrises at speeds of up to 40e113 km/h, (2) tropospheric winds need to increase considerably with height\nto encourage the forward slant of the cumulonimbus tower, and (3) the atmosphere around the cloud\nneeds to be \u201cunstable.\u201d These clouds are common in the tropics and temperate regions, but very rare at\nthe poles. Heavy rainfall is associated with these clouds as suggested in Fig. 8.6. These are liquid\nclouds throughout with ice crystals at the top. They are formed by very strong thermal convection.\n\nStratus clouds form as cold air flows out over warm sea temperatures and pick up both heat and\nmoisture from the ocean. This air then flows over colder sea surface temperatures (Fig. 8.7), which\nforms fog that is closely associated with stratus clouds.\n\nThese clouds can be at the surface, which makes them seem like fog, and they can reach 2 km in\nheight. Only light precipitation is generally associated with these liquid clouds. Their formation is due\nto advective cooling. A typical example is the marine stratus that forms off the coast of southern\nCalifornia. Here warm air flows out over cold water due to coastal upwelling and a dense layer of\nstratus clouds form a continuous layer off the coast.\n\nStratocumulus clouds are very similar to cumulus clouds, but they can form a semicontinuous layer\nmuch as the stratus clouds. These clouds generally form from either stratus or cumulus clouds.\n\nFIGURE 8.6\n\nCloud types and their shapes, heights, and functions.\n\n602 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nAltitudes again range from 0.6 to 2 km. There is occasional light rain or snow associated with these\nclouds. Altocumulus clouds are the cloud bands (Fig. 8.8) that can be seen high in the atmosphere.\nThese clouds are above the influence of thermals formed by heating of the atmosphere from the Earth\u2019s\nsurface.\n\nAltitudes range from 2 to 5.5 km and occasional light rain is often associated with these clouds.\nWhile most of the cloud is made up of liquid water the cloud may also contain ice crystals. They are\nformed by mid-level atmospheric disturbances and wave propagation (i.e., mountain waves).\n\nAltostratus clouds are really just stratus clouds that get above 2 km. It is these clouds that make for\nsuch beautiful sunsets and sunrises. They can get as high as 7 km. They are most common in middle\nlatitudes. They are both liquid water and ice crystal content clouds. Occasional light rain or snow can\noccur with these clouds. They are potentially dangerous to aircraft as they can lead to ice accumulation\non the wings.\n\nNimbostratus clouds constitute a thick, wet blanket of clouds with a ragged based caused by\ncontinuous precipitation. Moderate to heavy rain or snow is generally steady and prolonged. These\n\nFIGURE 8.7\n\nThe formation of advective fog.\n\nFIGURE 8.8\n\nAltocumulus cloud bands.\n\n8.1 CLOUD REMOTE SENSING 603\n\n\n\nclouds contain liquid water, raindrops, snowflakes, and ice crystals. They are formed by the thickening\nand lowering of an altostratus cloud.\n\nCirrus clouds are the highest of all clouds extending up to 14 km. They contain only ice crystals and\nare formed as streaks due to strong (161e240 km/h) upper tropospheric winds. Thus, they appear as\nthin streaks in the upper atmosphere. Any precipitation associated with these clouds does not reach the\nground. They have a minimum altitude of 5 km. Cirrocumulus clouds are a transition phase between\ncirrus clouds and cirrostratus clouds. A large number of these clouds may indicate the arrival of bad\nweather. Cirrostratus clouds are difficult to spot as they appear as a pale, milky lighting of the sky.\nThey never block out the Sun completely, but rather produce a variety of optical effects such as that\nshown here in Fig. 8.9. As the other cirrus clouds they are made completely of ice crystals and are\nformed through the spreading and joining of cirrus clouds.\n\n8.1.3 REMOTE SENSING OF CLOUDS AND CLOUD PROPERTIES\nClouds play an important role in the Earth\u2019s energy budget by exerting a control on the solar illu-\nmination of the Earth\u2019s surface. High cirrus clouds reflect little or no solar radiation and thus contribute\nto the warming of the Earth\u2019s surface. Likewise, low-level cumulus clouds reflect a portion of the Sun\u2019s\nradiation back toward the outer space excluding it from the solar radiation reaching the Earth\u2019s surface.\nThis has the net effect of cooling the Earth\u2019s surface due to reduced incoming solar radiation and\npersistent outward radiation from the Earth\u2019s surface. Very thick clouds block the radiation exchange\nin either direction resulting in no net change of Earth\u2019s surface properties.\n\nFIGURE 8.9\n\nEffect of cirrostratus cloud on the Sun.\n\n604 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nHow might clouds change in a warming world in the future. An increase in Earth\u2019s surface tem-\nperature would lead to an increase in evaporation increasing the amount of water vapor in the at-\nmosphere. This might create more low clouds with a high water vapor content that act as the cumulus\nclouds discussed earlier to block incoming solar radiation and thus biasing the process to outward long\nradiation and cooling the Earth\u2019s surface. These clouds will necessarily contain more liquid water,\nwhich would then result in a greater frequency and intensity of rainfall events. These increased rainfall\nepisodes would then result in a warming of the Earth\u2019s surface. Thunderstorms may also be more\nfrequent and more intense leading again to surface warming due to the presence of ice clouds at the top\nof the thunderstorm clouds. If the ice particles are larger and hence fall at greater speeds the clouds will\ndissipate more rapidly resulting in surface cooling.\n\nClimate model simulations show no agreement of the effect of clouds in a doubled CO2 envi-\nronment (Fig. 8.10). About half of them have clouds warming the atmosphere while another half of the\nmodels show the atmosphere cooling due to clouds in the same double CO2 scenario.\n\nModelers have concluded that to improve their numerical models they need to have a better\nknowledge of the cloud macrophysical properties such as cloud-frequency, cloud height, cloud type,\nand the amount and type of mass contained in the clouds. They also need to know the microphysical\nproperties such as cloud phase (water/ice) and the shape of the ice crystals.\n\nBefore talking about sensing the clouds two other fundamental cloud properties have to be dis-\ncussed: aerosols and optical thickness. It should be pointed out here that for some, the sensing of the\nclouds themselves is the target of their research, while for many others the clouds represent a barricade\nto their research and most of their concern is to get around the clouds.\n\n3\n\n2\n\nSW\nLW\nNET\n\nClouds cool\natmosphere in\nclimate with\ndoubled CO2 \n\nClouds warm\natmosphere in\nclimate with\ndoubled CO2 1\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20133\nBMRC NCAR MGO CSIRO MPI UKMO GFDL CCSR LMD MRI\n\nC\nha\n\nng\ne \n\nin\n c\n\nlo\nud\n\n ra\ndi\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nfo\n\nrc\nin\n\ng\nat\n\n to\np \n\nof\n th\n\ne \nat\n\nm\nos\n\nph\ner\n\ne \n(W\n\nm\n-2\n\n)\n\nFIGURE 8.10\n\nClimate model simulations of the effects of clouds in a double CO2 atmosphere.\n\n8.1 CLOUD REMOTE SENSING 605\n\n\n\n8.2 ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS AND OPTICAL THICKNESS\nAerosols are suspended solid or liquid particles in the gaseous atmosphere and they can contribute to\nclouds and to air pollution such as smog. There are several ways to characterize an aerosol. The most\nimportant in terms of environmental science and its application to health is the mass concentration,\nwhich is defined as the mass of particulate matter per unit volume. Also commonly used is the number\nconcentration, which is the number of particles per unit volume with units such as number/m3 or\nnumber/cm3.\n\nParticle size has a major influence on their properties and the aerosol particle radius or diameter is\nthe key property used to characterize aerosols. Most aerosols have a range of particle sizes and the\nparticles are nonuniform. While liquid aerosol particles are almost always spherical, solid particles can\nhave a variety of shapes. As a consequence, these particles are considered in terms of an equivalent\ndiameter. This equivalent diameter is the diameter of a regular particle that has the same value of some\nphysical quantity of a regular particle.\n\nFor a monodisperse aerosol a single number can be used, the particle diameter, to describe the size\nof the particles. For a mixed polydisperse aerosol the size of the aerosol has to be described with a\nparticle-size distribution (PSD). The PSD defines the relative amount of particles present, sorted by\nsize. The best way to present this information is in terms of a histogram where each bar depicts the\nnumber of particles present that have sizes included in the size bins normalized by the total number of\nparticles in the sample. Most aerosols have a skewed distribution with a long tail of larger particles. For\nthis reason, a Gaussian population cannot be used to describe the PSD of most aerosols. It can be\nappropriate for some aerosols such as certain pollens and spores.\n\nAn often chosen PSD is the log-normal distribution (NIST/SEMATECH, 2016) where the size\nfrequency is given by:\n\ndf \u00bc 1ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2$p\n\np\n$s\n\ne?\n\u00f0dp?dp\u00de2\n\n2$s2 $d dp; (8.1)\n\nwhere s is the standard deviation of the size distribution and dp is the arithmetic diameter. The log-\nnormal distribution has no negative values, and it can cover a wide range of values and fits\nobserved size distributions very well. It is often used to approximate the PSD of aerosols, aquatic\nparticles, and pulverized material. Other distributions that can be used are the Weibull or Rosine\nRammler distribution (Rosin and Rammler, 1933), which applies primarily to coarsely dispersed dusts\nand sprays, the NukiyamaeTanasawa distribution for sprays having extremely broad size ranges, the\npower function, which has been applied to atmospheric aerosols, the exponential distribution, which is\napplied to powdered materials (Gonzalez-Tello et al., 2008), and the KhrgianeMazin distribution for\ncloud water droplets (Plank, 1991)\n\nThere are three different dynamical regimes that govern the behavior of an aerosol. These regimes\ncan be defined by the Knudsen number of the particle which is given by\n\nKn \u00bc 2$p\nd\n\n; (8.2)\n\nwhere Kn is the mean free path of the suspending gas, and d is the diameter of the particle. Particles are\nin the free molecular regime when Kn [ 1. Here the particles are small compared to the mean free\n\n606 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\npath of the suspending gas. In this regime, particles interact with the suspending gas through a series of\nballistic collisions with gas molecules. Thus, they behave similar to gas molecules, tending to follow\nstreamlines and diffusing rapidly due to Brownian motion.\n\nThe continuum regime applies when Kn ? 1 where the particles are large when compared to the\nmean path length of the suspending gas. This means that the gas can be regarded as a continuous\nflowing fluid around the aerosol particle. Finally, all the particles that are between the free molecular\nand continuum regimes and Kn \u00bc 1 are in the transition regime. Here the forces are a complex mixture\nof the interactions of particles with the suspending gas molecules.\n\nAerosol partitioning theory governs the condensation and evaporation of substances to and from\naerosol surfaces. Condensation causes the mode of an aerosol number/size distribution to grow\nlarger diameters as the particles add mass. Conversely, evaporation results in smaller diameters as\nthe particles lose mass. Nucleation is the process of forming aerosol mass from the condensation of\na gaseous precursor, specifically a vapor. In order for the vapor to condense, it must be super-\nsaturated (its partial pressure must be greater than its vapor pressure). This can happen for three\nreasons: if the vapor pressure is lowered by lowering the temperature of the vapor, if chemical\nreactions increase the partial pressure of the gas or lower its vapor pressure, and if the addition of\nanother vapor lowers the equilibrium vapor pressure, and hence the dew point, due to the Raoult\neffect (Kwak et al., 2008).\n\n8.2.1 AEROSOL OPTICAL THICKNESS\nAerosol optical depth (AOD) or thickness is a measure of the transparency of an \u201catmosphere.\u201d Optical\ndepth is defined as the negative natural logarithm of the fraction of radiation that is not scattered or\nabsorbed along a path through the atmosphere. As a result, optical depth is dimensionless, and it is not\nactually a length as would be needed if it were a \u201cdepth.\u201d Thus, the differential optical depth can be\nwritten as\n\nds \u00bc ?k$r$cosq$ds; (8.3)\nwhere k is the opacity (\u00bcK/rwhere K is the extinction coefficient), r is the density, q is the angle to the\nnormal, and ds is the optical path through the atmosphere. The optical thickness or optical depth for an\natmosphere with an extinction coefficient of K can be computed by defining:\n\nm \u00bc cosq; (8.4)\nds \u00bc ?k$r$m$ds \u00bc n$s$m$ds; (8.5)\n\nwhere n is the number density and s is the cross-section, and integrating for normal incidence:\n\ns \u00bc\nZ z\n0\nK$dz \u00bc N$s; (8.6)\n\nwhere N is the column density.\n\n8.2.1.1 MODIS Cloud Optical Thickness\nThe MODIS cloud optical thickness algorithm is mainly intended for plane-parallel liquid water\nclouds (King et al., 1997). It is assumed that all MODIS data have been screened by the cloud mask of\n\n8.2 ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS AND OPTICAL THICKNESS 607\n\n\n\nAckerman et al. (1998) with additional information regarding particle phase computed from the al-\ngorithm of Menzel and Strabala (1997). To retrieve the cloud optical thickness and effective particle\nradius, a radiative transfer model is first used to compute the reflected intensity field. When the optical\nthickness of the atmosphere is sufficiently large, numerical results for the reflection function must\nagree with known asymptotic expressions for very thick layers (van de Hulst, 1980).\n\nKing et al. (1997) assume that the reflection function is not dependent on the exact nature of the\nPSD, depending primarily on the effective radius and, to a lesser extent, on the effective variance, as\nfirst suggested by Hansen and Travis (1974). Nakajima and King (1990) demonstrated that the sim-\nilarity parameter is unaffected by the variance of the cloud PSD, but the asymmetry parameter and\nhence the scaled optical thickness is weakly affected by the detailed shape of the size distribution.\n\nThe determination of the optical depth (sc) and the effective radius (re) from spectral reflectance\nmeasurements (from a satellite sensor such as MODIS) constitutes the inverse problem and it is\ntypically solved by comparing the measured reflectances with entries in a lookup table and searching\nfor the combination of sc and re that would give the best fit.\n\nThe spherical albedo as a function of wavelength for water clouds containing various values of the\neffective radius is presented here as Fig. 8.11. Since spherical albedo represents a mean value of the\nreflection function over all solar and observational zenith and azimuth angles, the reflection function\nitself must have a similar sensitivity to particle size.\n\nFIGURE 8.11\n\nCloud spherical albedo as a function of wavelength for selected values of the effective radius of cloud droplets.\n\nResults apply to water clouds having a modified gamma size distribution with an effective variance of\n\nvc \u00bc 0.11, cloud optical thickness (sc at 0.75 mm) equal to 16, and saturated water vapor ug \u00bc 0.45 g/cm2.\nThe locations and bandwidth of selected MODIS atmosphere bands are also shown as dark vertical stripes in\n\nthe figure.\n\n608 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe spectral albedo represents a mean value of the reflection function over all solar and obser-\nvational zenith and azimuth angles, the reflection function itself must have a similar sensitivity to\nparticle size. The calculation behind Fig. 8.11 (King et al., 1997) was carried out using asymptotic\ntheory for thick layers and the complex refractive indices of liquid water including the additional\ncontribution of water vapor. These computations only apply to clouds composed solely of liquid water\nand water vapor (King et al., 1990). The spherical albedo, and hence the reflection function, is sensitive\nto particle size at wavelengths near 1.64, 2.13, and 3.75 mm, wavelengths for which water vapor ab-\nsorption is small.\n\nCloud properties can also be estimated from the thermal infrared bands of MODIS. A combination\nof visible and near-infrared (VNIR) bands provides information on both optical thickness and effective\nradius. In the 3.7 mmwindow, both solar reflected and thermal emitted radiation are present. The use of\nthe reflectance for estimating cloud droplet size is considered to be much more sensitive than the\nthermal component. In either case, the thermal and solar components of the 3.7 mm channel must be\nseparated to provide the desired estimate. CO2 absorption is more important in the 4.3 mm channel and\nat wavelengths larger than 13 mm. The MODIS bands in these spectral regions can be used to infer\nvertical changes of atmospheric temperature.\n\nCorrections are made for cloud phase, atmospheric water vapor content, and other atmospheric\neffects such as Rayleigh scattering. An algorithm for computing cloud optical depth and effective\nradius is shown here in Fig. 8.12.\n\nThe use of the 3.75 mm band complicates this calculation due to the presence of both reflected and\nemitted radiation. Cloud emission at 3.75 mm is weakly dependent on cloud effective radius unlike\nsolar reflectance so that the relative strengths of the two components depend on particle size. A\nseparate algorithm can be developed for using the 2.75 mm data alone. An example of the MODIS\ncloud optical thickness computed from the algorithm described in Fig. 8.12 is shown here in Fig. 8.13.\n\nThis image is computed from MODIS data taken by NASA\u2019s AQUA satellite over a 24-h period on\nOctober 23, 2011. The colors have been separated into water and ice contributions to the cloud optical\nthickness. A summary of zonal mean cloud optical thickness values is presented here in Fig. 8.14\nwhich is a plot of the daytime cloud optical thickness values from MODIS and VIRS over land and\nwater separately.\n\n8.2.2 GROUND VALIDATION OF SATELLITE OBSERVED OPTICAL THICKNESS\n8.2.2.1 The BeereLambert Law\nThe primary source of validation data for satellite estimates of optical thickness or cloud optical depth\nis ground measurements made by a Sun-photometer. Modern Sun photometers incorporate Sun-\ntracking into their operation along with a spectral filtering photodetector and a data acquisition sys-\ntem. The variable measured is referred to as direct-Sun radiance.\n\nIt has to be acknowledged that a Sun-photometer operates within the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and\ntherefore the measured radiance does not equal the radiance emitted by the sun, which is then filtered\nby the atmosphere above the Sun-photometer. This atmospheric effect is given by Beer\u2019s law\n(Mayerho?fer et al., 2016), which states that there is a logarithmic dependence between the trans-\nmission, T, of light through a substance and the product of the absorption coefficient of the substance,\n\n8.2 ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS AND OPTICAL THICKNESS 609\n\n\n\na, and the distance the light travels through a material (i.e., the path length), l. The general Beere\nLambert law can be written for atmospheric gases as\n\nT \u00bc I\nI0\n\n\u00bc e?a\n0\n$l \u00bc e?s$l$N ; (8.7)\n\nwhere I0 and I are the intensity of the incident light and that of the transmitted light respectively, s is\nthe cross-section of the light absorption by a single particle and N is the density (number per unit\nvolume) of absorbing particles. Historically the Lambert Law states that the absorption is proportional\nto the light path length, whereas the Beer Law says that absorption is proportional to the concentration\nof absorbing species in the material rather than simply on the path length.\n\nDetermine Geometry\nand Surface Albedo\n\nfor each pixel:\n\nCalculated libraries for\n?e =?e1, ?e2,...,?eM\nre =re1, re2,...,reN\n\nVisible & NIR\nMeasurements\n\n(intensity or bidirectional\nreflectance):\n\nVisible & NIR\nAtmospheric\nCorrection\n\nAssumed / inferred above-\ncloud atmosphere: e,g.,\natmospheric transmission\nand Rayleigh scattering\ncorrections\n\nExo-atmospheric solar\nspectral flux for each band\nwith radiance\nmeasurement\n\nResidual Definition:\n\nDetermine combination ?em, ren that minimizes error\n\n? ?0 ?

These are\ngiven as follows:\n\n1. The absorbers must act independently of each other.\n2. The absorbing medium must be homogeneous in the interaction volume.\n3. The absorbing medium must not scatter the radiation.\n4. The incident radiation must consist of parallel rays, each traversing the same length in the\n\nabsorbing medium.\n5. The incident radiation should preferably be monochromatic, or have at least a width that is\n\nnarrower than that of the absorbing transition.\n6. The incident flux must not influence the atoms or molecules; it should only act as a noninvasive\n\nprobe of the species under study. In particular, this implies that the light should not cause optical\nsaturation or optical pumping, since such effects will deplete the lower level and possibly give rise\nto stimulated emission.\n\nIn the atmosphere the BeereLambert Law becomes a bit more complicated. There is scattering in\naddition to absorption that attenuates the radiation. It can be written as:\n\nI \u00bc I0$e?mfsa\u00fesg\u00fesNO2\u00fesw\u00fesO3\u00fesrg; (8.8)\nwhere each sx is the optical depth whose subscript identifies the source of the absorption or scattering:\na refers to aerosols (that absorb and scatter), g are uniformly mixed gases [mainly carbon dioxide\n(CO2) and molecular oxygen (O2), which only absorb], NO2 is nitrogen dioxide, mainly due to urban\npollution (absorbs only), w is water vapor absorption, O3 is ozone (absorbs only), r is Rayleigh\nscattering from molecular oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) which is responsible for the blue color of the\nsky.m is the optical mass or air mass factor, a term approximately equal (for small and moderate values\nof q) to 1/cosq, where q is the observed object\u2019s zenith angle (the angle measured from the direction\nperpendicular to the Earth\u2019s surface at the observation site).\n\nThis equation can be used to retrieve sa, the aerosol optical thickness, which is necessary for the\ncorrection of satellite images and also important in accounting for the role of aerosols in climate.\n\nWhen the path taken by the light is through the atmosphere, the density of the absorbing gas is not\nconstant, so the original equation must be modified as follows:\n\nT \u00bc I\nI0\n\n\u00bc e?\nR\na\n0\n$dz \u00bc e?s\n\nR\nN$dz; (8.9)\n\nwhere z is the distance along the path through the atmosphere, all other symbols are as defined earlier.\nThis is taken into account in each sx in the atmospheric equation aforementioned.\n\n8.2.2.2 The AERONET\nThe AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) is a network of ground-based Sun photometers that\nmeasure atmospheric aerosol properties. The measurement system is a solar-powered CIMEL Electro-\nnique 318A spectral radiometer (Fig. 8.15) that measures Sun and sky radiances at a number of fixed\nwavelengths within the VNIR spectrum. AERONET provides continuous cloud-screened observations of\nspectral AOD, precipitable water, and inversion aerosol products in diverse aerosol regimes. Inversion\nproducts are retrieved from almucantar scans (circle on the celestial sphere parallel to the horizon) of\nradiance as a function of scattering angle and include products such as aerosol volume size distribution,\n\n612 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\naerosol complex refractive index, optical absorption (single scattering albedo), and the aerosol scattering\nphase function. All these products represent an average of the total aerosol column within the atmosphere.\n\nDeveloped by NASA under the leadership of Dr. Brent Holben, AERONET provides ground-truth\ncalibration data for NASA and other international satellite missions. The CIMEL Sun photometer was\nselected for this system as it was deemed to be rather weather resistant and automatic in its operation.\nA sky scanning instrument provides spectral radiometry to measure atmospheric aerosol properties.\nThese data are relayed regularly via geostationary communications satellites making it possible to\ncontinuously monitor atmospheric aerosols with this ground network (Fig. 8.16). The associated data\n\nFIGURE 8.15\n\nCIMEL Sun photometer (http://www.cimel.fr/?instrument\u00bcmulti-band-sunsky-photometer&lang\u00bcen).\nFrom CIMEL.\n\nFIGURE 8.16\n\nApproximate locations of the AERONET CIMEL Sun photometers (Holben et al., 1998).\n\n8.2 ATMOSPHERIC AEROSOLS AND OPTICAL THICKNESS 613\n\nhttp://www.cimel.fr/?instrument=multi-band-sunsky-photometer&amp;lang=en\nhttp://www.cimel.fr/?instrument=multi-band-sunsky-photometer&amp;lang=en\nhttp://www.cimel.fr/?instrument=multi-band-sunsky-photometer&amp;lang=en\n\n\ncollection system makes it possible to map approximately 90% of the Earth\u2019s surface. The resultant\ndatabase is completely open access and users can directly download data from the AERONET network\n(Holben et al., 1998). This is enabled by a user-friendly graphical user interface making it easy for the\nuser to select the data desired (Holben et al., 1998).\n\nThe aerosol properties are retrieved via an inversion algorithm developed by Dubovik and King\n(2000). Further algorithms were developed, for example, by Dubovik et al. (2006) to take into account\nnonspherical shapes of aerosol particles such as mineral dust. The Sun photometers are calibrated at\nleast twice per year with a 2-m integrating sphere at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). In\naddition, 3000 dark current measurements are made during the calibration cycle for each instrument.\nTo judge the CIMEL\u2019s stability, the measurements made at NOAA\u2019s Mauna Loa Observatory are\nmonitored. The location of this site above local contaminating sources and its high altitude provides a\nvery stable aerosol and irradiance regime in the mornings (Shaw, 1963).\n\nThe results of an inversion are presented with the four channels sky radiances as a function of\nscattering angle, volume size distribution from 0.1 to w8.0 mm, scattering phase function, and a table\nof the aerosol optical thickness and wavelength exponent from both direct Sun and the aureole (Sun\u2019s\nhalo) measurements made by the photometer (Fig. 8.17).\n\nThe first AERONET instruments were installed in the early 1990\u2019s and since 1997 the full system\nof over 100 instruments has been operating. This network continues to operate providing regular global\nmeasurements of atmospheric aerosols at their homepage (http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/).\n\n8.3 ATMOSPHERIC PROFILING\n8.3.1 RADIOSONDES, RAWINSONDES, AND DROPSONDES\nTraditional atmospheric profiling has been carried out using some type of sonde, which is a device that\nis either carried aloft by a balloon or dropped from an aircraft. Derived from a French word meaning to\nsound or profile the term was first applied in the early 1900s. Since the late 1930s the weather service\nof the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has collected atmospheric profiles\nwith radiosondes (Fig. 8.18), which is an instrument package suspended 25 m or more beneath a large\nballoon inflated with hydrogen or helium gas. Thus, these systems were given the more commonly\nknown designation of \u201cweather balloon.\u201d\n\nAs the radiosonde ascends at about 300 m/min, sensors on the radiosonde measure pressure, tem-\nperature, and relative humidity thus producing data on the profile of atmospheric temperature and relative\nhumidity. These sensors are linked to a battery powered, 300 mW, or less, radio transmitter that sends the\ndata to a sensitive ground tracking antenna on a radio frequency ranging from 1675 to 1685 MHz. Wind\nspeed and direction aloft can be obtained by tracking the positions of sondes equipped with GPS or by a\nradio direction finding antenna. These latter sondes are generally referred to as rawinsondes to differ-\nentiate them from the simple radiosondes that only measure temperature and humidity profiles.\n\nA typical weather balloon (Fig. 8.19) sounding can last longer than a couple of hours and the\nballoon can reach altitudes over 35 km and drift more than 300 km from their original launch site.\nDuring its ascent the sonde is exposed to temperatures as cold as ?90?C and air pressure less than 1%\nof that found on the surface of the Earth. If the radiosonde enters the jet stream, it can travel at speeds\nexceeding 400 km/h. When released, the balloon is about 1.5 m in diameter and gradually expands as\nit rises. When it reaches a diameter of about 6e8 m, it bursts terminating the atmospheric profile.\n\n614 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\nhttp://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n\n\nA small orange parachute slows the descent of the radiosonde instrument package minimizing the\ndanger to lives and property.\n\nAlthough all the data from the radiosonde ascent are used, the data from the surface to a pressure of\n400 hPa (about 7,185 m in altitude for the International Standard Atmosphere for dry air) are\nconsidered to be minimally acceptable for National Weather Service operations. Thus, a flight may be\ndeemed a failure and a second radiosonde will be released if the balloon bursts before reaching the\n400 hPa pressure level or if more than 6 min of pressure and/or temperature data are missing between\nthe surface and the 400 hPa level.\n\nWorldwide there are over 800 upper-air observation stations and through international agreements\ndata are exchanged routinely between countries. Most upper-air stations are located in the Northern\nHemisphere and all observations are usually taken at the same time each day (up to an hour between\n\nFIGURE 8.17\n\nA successful inversion of almucantar radiances during low aerosol loading and high aerosol loading.\n\n8.3 ATMOSPHERIC PROFILING 615\n\n\n\nFIGURE 8.18\n\nA typical radiosonde instrument package.\n\nFIGURE 8.19\n\nTypical weather balloon configuration.\n\n616 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n00:00 and/or 12:00 UTC), 365 days a year. When severe weather is expected additional sounding may\nbe taken during the day at a selected number of stations.\n\nRadiosonde profiles are used as input for computer-based weather forecast models; for local\nforecasts of severe weather, for aviation and marine forecasts; to study weather and climate change, as\ninput for air pollution models and as ground truth for satellite data.\n\nAnother sonde-based method of atmospheric profiling uses a dropsonde, which is a radiosonde\npackage that is dropped from a specified altitudes. Each dropsonde also carries sensors to measure\npressure, temperature, and relative humidity, and they also carry a GPS receiver as well to sense wind\nspeed and direction. Like the radiosonde, during its descent the dropsonde is equipped with a parachute\nto slow its descent and to increase its vertical stability during its flight (Fig. 8.20).\n\nDuring the dropsonde descent the data on pressure, temperature, and relative humidity are sent\nback by radio just as in the radiosonde. The advantage of the dropsonde over the radiosonde is that it\nprovides a nearly vertical atmospheric profile when compared with the typical radiosonde profile. Each\nsonde is about 40 cm long, and 5.8 cm in diameter, and weighs 0.39 kg.\n\n8.3.2 SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING ATMOSPHERIC PROFILING\n8.3.2.1 The TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder\nFirst deployed in space in 1978 the TOVS was the first system designed to measure atmospheric profiles\nfrom orbiting weather satellites. TOVS was actually not a single instrument, but rather a group of in-\nstruments. The primary sensor was the high-resolution infrared radiation sounder (HIRS), which is a\ndiscrete stepping, line-scan radiometer measuring scene radiances in 20 spectral bands to make it\npossible to calculate the vertical temperature profile from the Earth\u2019s surface to about 40 km altitude.\n\nMultispectral data from a single visible channel (90.69 mm), 7 shortwave channels (3.7e4.6 mm),\nand 12 longwave channels (6.5e15 mm) are obtained from a single telescope, and a rotating filter\nwheel containing 20 filters. An elliptical scan mirror provides the cross-track scanning of 56 in-\ncrements each being 1.8?. The mirror steps rapidly (<35 ms), then holds at each position while the 20\nfilter segments are sampled, which takes about 100 ms. The resulting field of view (FOV) for each\nchannel is approximately 1.4? in the visible and shortwave IR bands, and 1.3? in the longwave IR band,\nwhich from an altitude of 833 km covers an area 18.9 km in diameter at nadir on the scan (http://www.\nclass.ngdc.noaa.gov/data_available/tovs_atovs/index.htm).\n\nThe TOVS system also includes the microwave sounding unit (MSU) which is a four-channel passive\nmicrowave spectrometer operating in the 5.5 mm oxygen region of the atmosphere. The MSU has two\nfour-inch diameter antennas each having an instantaneous FOV (IFOV) of 7.5? giving a ground resolution\nof 124 km at nadir for a satellite altitude of 833 km. The distance between these 124 km spots at nadir is\n168.1 km. The instrument has a 12-bit digitization and the values may be converted into brightness\ntemperatures using the calibration information, which is appended to the data stream but not automat-\nically applied. Latitude and longitudes for each Earth FOV is included in the data stream as are time tags.\n\nBecause the MSU wavelengths can penetrate most clouds, its measurements can provide tem-\nperatures below clouds. Some of the problems with these microwave measurements come from\nchanges in surface emissivity and the sensitivity of these measurements to changes in precipitation.\n\nFinally, TOVS includes the stratospheric sounding unit (SSU), which is another step-scanned,\ninfrared spectrometer with only three channels in the 15 mm carbon dioxide absorption band designed\nto make measurements at the top of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The three channels have the same\n\n8.3 ATMOSPHERIC PROFILING 617\n\nhttp://www.class.ngdc.noaa.gov/data_available/tovs_atovs/index.htm\nhttp://www.class.ngdc.noaa.gov/data_available/tovs_atovs/index.htm\n\n\nfrequency, but different cell pressures designed for different atmospheric heights. The 10? FOV results\nin a 147 km Earth surface resolution at nadir. A calibration sequence is initiated every eight scans and\nthe calibration are included in the data stream, but are not automatically applied to the sensor data.\n\nThe HIRS, MSU, and SSU channels are described here in Table 8.1 with a reference to the principal\natmospheric gas that they are sensing and the primary purpose of this radiance observation.\n\nSquare-cone Parachute\nincreases stability of dropsonde\n\nNCARNCAR GPS Dropsonde\nthe definitive atmospheric profiling tool\n\nParachute Dimensions\nHeight: 10\u201d\nWidth:  12\u201d sides;\n             16\u201d diagonally\n\nSound Dimensions\nLength: 16\u201d\nDiameter: 2.75\u201d\nWeight: 0.86 lbs.\n\nGPS Antenna\n\nGPS Receiver\ncollects the data from\n\nGPS satellites used to calculate\nwind speed and direction\n\nPressure sensor\n\nHumidity sensors\nand temperature sensor\n\nFall Speed ranges from 36 mph\nat 20,000 feet to 24 mph at sea level.\nA drop from 20,000 feet lasts 7 minutes.\n\nRadio Transmitter sends temperature,\nhumidity, pressure, and GPS (wind)\ndata to the aircraft every 0.5 seconds\n\nBattery pack provides power for\nat least one hour\n\nMicroprocessor controls the\ntransmitter and digitizes data\nfrom the sensors\n\nShock Cord reduces stress\nwhen chute opens\n\nVents fill chute within\n10 seconds after release\nfrom aircraft\n\nFIGURE 8.20\n\nNCAR GPS Dropsonde (https://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/what-dropsonde).\n\nFrom \u00a9 2013 University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/COSMIC.\n\n618 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\nhttps://www.eol.ucar.edu/content/what-dropsonde\n\n\nTable 8.1 Characteristics of TOVS Channels\n\nHIRS Channel\nNumber\n\nChannel\nCentral Wave\nNumber\n\nCentral\nWavelength\n(mm)\n\nPrincipal\nAbsorbing\nConstituents\n\nLevel of Peak\nEnergy\nContribution Purpose of the Radiance Observation\n\n1 668 15.00 CO2 30 mb Temperature sounding.

As a result, the HIRS, MSU, and SSU channels have\nthe weighting functions shown here in Fig. 8.21 where the y axis it given in mbars of atmospheric\npressure, which is of course greatest at the surface and decreases as going up in the atmosphere.\n\nNote that most of the channels are used to compute the atmospheric temperature profile while only\nfour of the longwave thermal infrared channels are used to compute the water vapor profile. Since most\nof this water vapor is in the troposphere, these weighting functions (Fig. 8.21 lower right) go from the\nsurface up to about 400 mbar. This set of weighting functions has a very different vertical scale than\nthe other three groups of weighting functions. The first seven channels are well distributed over the\natmosphere with channels 4e7 concentrated in the lower levels of the atmosphere. Likewise, the\nchannels 13e16 are also concentrated near the surface. The SSU channels are all in the upper layer\nwhile the MSU microwave channels all have their temperatures below the altitude of 20 mbar\n(Fig. 8.21 lower left).\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in the TOVS system is deciding just how to combine the HIRS, MSU,\nand SSU data. For example, the HIRS and MSU sampling are dramatically different as pointed out in\nFig. 8.22. The challenge of merging the much larger MSU spots with the high resolution of the HIRS\ndata can be appreciated. This is done by averaging those HIRS spots together that are completely\nwithin an MSU spot in the final TOVS product. As indicated by Table 8.1 the HIRS channels are also\nused individually for other surface and atmospheric parameter retrievals.\n\nThe actual retrieval of atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles involves an inversion\nmethod using atmospheric radiative transfer modeling. This results in a linear least squares fit of the\natmospheric model to the TOVS radiances. A Taylor series expansion is used to linearize the atmo-\nspheric radiative transfer equations and boundary conditions are set using ancillary surface observa-\ntions (Svensson, 1985). These many approximations resulted in rather large errors in the derived\natmospheric temperature and moisture profiles.\n\nThus, the assimilation of the independently derived TOVS temperature and humidity profiles\ninto numerical forecast models did not improve the model forecast (Eyre et al., 1993). In\nresponse, methods were developed to directly assimilate TOVS sensor radiances directly into the\nnumerical model. A scheme known as \u201cone-dimensional variational analysis\u201d (1DVAR) was\ndeveloped at the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) as a method\nfor extracting information from TOVS radiances for use in their operational data-assimilation\nsystem. The 1DVAR is based on variational principles applied to the analysis of the atmo-\nspheric profile at a single location, using a forecast profile and its error covariance as constraints.\nThis development has led to a three-dimensional approach, which is now the standard for the\nroutine assimilation of cloud-cleared TOVS radiances into long-range weather forecast models\n(Derber and Wu, 1997).\n\nThe TOVS system was replaced by the Advanced TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (ATOVS)\nwith the launch of the NOAA-15 satellite December 15, 1998. In the ATOVS system the MSU was\nreplaced by the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A).\n\n8.3.2.2 The Advanced TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder\nA change in the TOVS system took place when the satellite NOAA-15 was launched carrying the\nAMSU-A, the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) and the High Resolution Infrared\nSounder Version 3 (HIRS/3).

The European MetOp satellites also carry this same suite of\ninstruments.\n\nThe characteristics of HIRS/4 are given here in Table 8.2, which briefly summarizes the parameters\nof this instrument.\n\nIn addition to profiles of atmospheric temperature and moisture, HIRS data are used for a\nnumber of other applications such as the derivation of surface skin temperature of the land and\nocean surfaces, sensing outgoing longwave radiation, cloud fraction, cloud-top height, total in-\ntegrated column ozone, precipitation and wind speed and direction. Global coverage is available\nfor the HIRS data, which has an IFOV of approximately 1.4? in the visible and shortwave\nchannels, and 1.3? in the longwave infrared bands. For the nominal altitude of 833 km these result\nin a ground IFOVs of 20.3 and 18.9 km in diameter respectively at nadir. At the edge of scan this\nincreases to a pixel that is 68.3 km cross-track by 34.8 km along-track for the visible and shortwave\ninfrared channels. At the equator the 99? scan equates to a swath width of 2248 km centered on the\nsubsatellite track.

It is a cross-track, line-scanned in-\nstrument that measures scene radiances in 15 discrete frequency channels. These measurements make\nit possible to calculate the vertical atmospheric temperature profiles from about 3 mbar (w45 km) to\nthe Earth\u2019s surface. At each frequency the antenna beamwidth is a constant 3.3? (at the half-power\npoint). Thirty contiguous scene resolution cells are sampled in a stepped-scan fashion every 8 s\nwith each scan covering 50? of each side of the subsatellite path. This scan pattern and angular res-\nolution translate to a 50 km diameter cell at nadir and a 2343 km swath width for an 833 km nominal\norbital altitude.\n\nThe AMSU-A is composed of two separate modules: the AMSU-A1 and the AMSU-A2. The first\nhas 12 channels (3 through 14 mm), and one 15 mm channel, which together provide a complete and\naccurate vertical atmospheric temperature profile from the Earth\u2019s surface to about 45 km altitude.\nAMSU-A2 contains the two lower-frequencies (K-band channel 1 and Ka-band channel 2), which\nare used to study the atmospheric water content excepting the small ice particles as noted earlier.\nA summary of AMSU-A parameter can be found here in Table 8.3.\n\nAMSU-A replaced the functions of the MSU and the SSU in the original TOVS system. For this\nreason, AMSU-B data were not used in the ATOVS system to retrieve atmospheric temperature and\nmoisture profiles. Global coverage is available for the AMSU-A data, which have an IFOV of\napproximately 3.3?, which for the usual 833 km altitude translates to a ground resolution of 48.05 km\n\nTable 8.2 Summary of HIRS/4 Parameters\n\nParameter Value\n\nIR calibration Warm target and space background\n\nChannels 20\n\nCross-track scan angle ?49.5?\nScan time 6.4 s\n\nNumber of steps 56\n\nStep angle 1.8?\n\nStep time 100 ms\n\nData precision 13 bits\n\nTime between start of each scan 6.4 s\n\nAngular field of view (FOV) (visible, shortwave IR) 1.40?\n\nAngular FOV (longwave IR) 1.30?\n\nAt an altitude of 833 km:\n\nNadir ground instantaneous\nfield of view (IFOV) (visible, shortwave IR)\n\n20.3 km diameter\n\nNadir ground IFOV (longwave IR) 18.9 km diameter\n\nScan-end ground IFOV (visible, shortwave) 68.3 km cross-track by 34.8 km along-track\n\nSwath width (visible, shortwave IR) 2248.8 km to far edge of outer FOV\n\n624 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nin diameter at nadir. At scan edge the resolution reduces to a 149.1 km cross-track by a 79.4 km along-\ntrack footprint.\n\nAMSU-B is a 5-channel microwave radiometer designed to measure radiation from different layers\nin the atmosphere to obtain global data on humidity profiles. AMSU-B covers channels 16e20 where\nchannels 18, 19, and 20 span the strongly opaque water absorption line at 183 GHz to provide data on\nthe atmosphere\u2019s humidity level. Channels 16 and 17 at 80 and 150 GHz, respectively, penetrate\nthrough the atmosphere to the Earth\u2019s surface. Beginning with NOAA-18, AMSU-B was replaced by\nthe MHS. At each channel frequency the antenna beamwidth is a constant 1.1? (at the half-power\npoint). The scan pattern and this geometric configuration translate to the ground resolution of\n16.0 km diameter at nadir for the nominal 833 km altitude.\n\nThe MHS is a self-calibrating microwave radiometer, observing the Earth with an FOV of ?50?\nfrom nadir in five frequency channels of the millimeter-wave band (90e190 GHz). Together with\nAMSU-A the MHS provides the operational microwave atmospheric sounding capability for NOAA\n18, 19 satellites as well as the European MetOp satellites. A summary of MHS parameters is given in\nTable 8.4.\n\n8.3.2.3 The Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer Atmospheric Sounder\nThe Visible Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) was designed to\noperate in three distinct modes to provide parameter measurement, sampling flexibility, spectral band\nselection, geographic location, and variable sensitivity. In the VISSR mode it was a scanner just like\nthe previous VISSR instruments that had been on board GOES 1, 2, 3. The visible (0.55e0.75 mm) and\nthe thermal infrared (10.5e12.5 mm) use common RitcheyeChre?tien optical system. A single west-to-\neast raster scan line was collected for each revolution of the spinning spacecraft. A 20? north-to-south\nimage frame was collected from 1821 steps of the scan mirror, one 0.192-mrad step for each spacecraft\nrevolution. A full image took 18.2 min to complete with an additional 2 min to reset for the next image.\n\nTable 8.3 Summary of AMSU-A Parameters\n\nParameter Value\n\nCalibration Internal target and space background\n\nChannels 15\n\nCross-track scan angle ?48.33?\nScan time 8.0 s\n\nNumber of steps 30\n\nStep angle 3.33?\n\nStep time 202.5 ms\n\nData precision 16 bits\n\nTime between start of each scan 8.0 s\n\nAngular FOV 3.33?\n\nAt an altitude of 833 km:\n\nGround IFOV at nadir 48.05 km diameter\n\nGround IFOV at center of outer FOV 149.1 km cross-track by 79.4 km along-track\n\nSwath width 2226.8 km to far edge of outer FOV\n\n8.3 ATMOSPHERIC PROFILING 625\n\n\n\nEight visible-spectrum detectors (0.9 km horizontal resolution) and one mercury-cadmium-tellu-\nride thermal infrared detector (6.9 km horizontal resolution) would sweep the Earth during each scan.\nThe dwell-sounding mode used up to 12 spectral filters in a wheel covering the range 14.74 mm\nthrough 3.94 mm positioned in the optical train while the scanner occupies a single scan line. The filter\nwheel was programmed so that each spectral band filter dwells on a single scan line for from 0 to 255\nspacecraft spins. Either the 6.9 km or 13.8 km resolution detectors can be used for the 7 filter positions\nin the spectral range 6.725e14.25 mm. The 13.8 km resolution detectors were used. Selectable frame\nsize, position, and scan direction were programmable from the ground. For VAS a 10-bit reduced\nresolution (3.5 km) visible image provided the general information needed for the VAS data pro-\ncessing. In some of the spectral channels multiple-line sampling was required to enhance the signal-to-\nnoise ratio. Typically, 20e30 satellite spins at a single north-to-south scan line were required to obtain\nthe desired accuracy in the sounding data. This number of repeat spins per line should provide the\natmospheric sounding at a 30 ? 30 km resolution.\n\nThe multispectral imaging mode can provide normal VISSR-IR imagery plus data in any two\nselected spectral bands having a resolution of 13.8 km. This band takes advantage of the small\nmercury-cadmium-telluride detector offset in the north-to-south plane. Using the data from these\ndetectors simultaneously produces a complete infrared map when they are operational every other scan\nline. This fact allows using the larger detectors during half of the imaging/scanning sequence to obtain\nadditional spectral information. Unlimited north-to-south frame sizes and position detection, within\nthe maximum north-to-south FOV scan direction, could be selected. Visible data are not available\nin this mode.\n\nThe VISSR output was to be digitized and transmitted to the ground. There, the signal was fed into\na \u201cline stretcher,\u201d where it was stored and time-stretched. The processed data were sent back to the\n\nTable 8.4 Summary of Microwave Humidity Sounder Parameters\n\nParameter Value\n\nCalibration Internal blackbody target and space\nbackground\n\nChannels 5\n\nCross-track scan angle ?49.44?\nScan time 2.67 s\n\nNumber of steps 90\n\nStep angle N/A\n\nStep time N/A\n\nData precision 16 bits\n\nTime between start of each scan 1.11 s\n\nAngular field of view (FOV) 1.1?\n\nAt an altitude of 870 km:\n\nGround instantaneous\nFOV (IFOV) at nadir\n\n17 km diameter\n\nGround IFOVat center of outer FOV 51.6 km cross-track by 26.9 km along-track\n\nSwath width 2348 km to far edge of outer FOV\n\n626 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nsatellite in a reduced resolution form to serve as the WEFAX for broadcast on the VHF band. VISSR\nand VAS data are then transferred to the Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System\n(CLASS) where it is archived and available for distribution.\n\nThe VAS channels and their uses are described here in Table 8.5 (Montgomery and Uccellini,\n1985).\n\nThese channels correspond to the weighting functions shown here in Fig. 8.23. A study of simu-\nlations of this instrument by Chesters et al. (1983) determined that: significant moisture gradients can\nbe seen directly in image of the VAS channels, temperature, and moisture profiles can be retrieved with\nsufficient accuracy to delineate the major features of a severe storm environment, and the quality of\nVAS mesoscale sounding improves with conditioning using local weather statistics. It was also found\nthat it was still possible to retrieve mesoscale regions of potential instability for a mostly clear pre-\nthunderstorm environment. The RMS tropospheric profile errors are ?1?C and ?25% in temperature\nand mixing ratio, respectively. These simulations suggest that the VAS data will yield the best\nsoundings when a human being classifies the scene, picks relatively clear areas for retrieval, and\napplies a \u201clocal\u201d statistical database to resolve the ambiguities of satellite observations in favor of the\nmost probably atmospheric structure.\n\nA comparison between the characteristics of the VAS and HIRS are given here in Table 8.6 from\nMontgomery and Uccellini (1985).\n\nThis same study produced a numerical comparison between the coincident channels on VAS and\nHIRS for three different VAS on three different GOES satellites (Table 8.7). All of the large mean\ndifferences have the VAS value higher than that for HIRS and are generally in the higher frequencies\n\nTable 8.5 VAS Channel Characteristics\n\nVAS Ch.\nNo.\n\nSpectral Filters\n\nPurpose for\nSounding\n\nMain\nAbsorbing Gas\n\nOther\nSignificant\nEffects\n\nCenter Width\n\nmm cmL1 cmL1\n\n1 14.730 0678.7 10.0 Temperature CO2 O3\n\n2 14.480 0690.6 16.0 Temperature CO2 O3\n\n3a 14.250 0701.6 16.0 Temperature CO2 O3\n\n4a 14.010 0713.6 20.0 Temperature CO2 O3\n\n5a 13.330 0750.0 20.0 Temperature CO2 O3\n\n6 04.525 2210.0 45.0 Temperature \u00fe cloud N2O Sun\n7a 12.660 0790.0 20.0 Moisture H2O CO2 \u00fe dust\n8a 11.170 0895.0 140.0 Surface H2O CO2 \u00fe dust\n9a 07.261 1377.0 40.0 Moisture H2O CO2\n\n10a 06.725 1487.0 150.0 Moisture H2O e\n\n11 04.444 2250.0 40.0 Temperature \u00fe cloud N2O, CO2 Sun\n12 03.945 2535.0 140.0 Surface H2O Sun \u00fe dust\naAvailable at 6.9 km as well as 13.8 km instantaneous geographic field of view.\n\n8.3 ATMOSPHERIC PROFILING 627\n\n\n\nused for the moisture retrieval. The large mean differences are not always associated with a large\nstandard deviation suggesting a bias in the VAS measurements. Different VAS instruments have\ndifferent large biases in different channels so this behavior is not consistent between the different VAS\ninstruments. It must be remembered that the HIRS and VAS were not completely coincident in time\nand space when these comparisons were made.\n\nMontgomery and Uccellini (1985) concluded that the agreement between the VAS and HIRS\nobservations is surprisingly good for the CO2 channels. The temperature calibrations of the respective\ninstruments are accurate to only ?1K, which is about the general order of magnitude of the agreement\nbetween the channels. The surface weighting bands 7, 8, and 12 are very sensitive to good geolocation\nand temporal coincidence. The water vapor bands 9 and 10 are sensitive to the constancy of the water\n\nFIGURE 8.23\n\nStandard VAS weighting functions.\n\n628 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nvapor concentration in each satellite\u2019s FOV.With the 3-h time separation used here, large differences in\nwater vapor content are likely. Earlier studies Menzel et al. (1981), and Chesters et al. (1983) have\ndemonstrated that VAS channels 2, 3, and 4 exhibit a consistent negative bias with respect to HIRS.\nThe VAS radiances were also compared to radiative transfer calculations of VAS radiances using\nradiosonde data for several hundred cloud-free FOVs. As in the HIRS comparison the VAS radiances\nof GOES-4 bands two to four are consistently lower than the corresponding values from radiosonde\nanalyses. The VAS calibration algorithm appears to generate values that are 2e3?C below the\nradiosonde values for these bands. The relative errors for GOES-5 and GOES-6 are typically less than\n1?C for the CO2 bands, which is well within the expected accuracy of these data.\n\n8.3.2.4 Atmospheric Infrared Sounder\nAIRS is a NASA facility instrument to support climate research and improve weather forecasting by\nproviding detailed and accurate atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles. It was launched on\nNASA\u2019s Aqua satellite on May 4, 2002, and is one of the six instruments carried by this satellite which\nis a part of NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System of Satellites. Two of the other instruments carried by\nAqua are the AMSU (discussed earlier) and the Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB). Combined with\nthe AIRS these instruments provide very comprehensive atmospheric column information on both\ntemperature, cloud amount-height, spectral outgoing infrared (3.7e15.4 mm) radiation and water\nvapor from the top of the atmosphere to the Earth\u2019s surface where it also provides estimates of the\n\nTable 8.6 AComparison Between the Characteristics of the VAS and HIRS\n\nFeature VAS on GOES HIRS on NOAA\n\nOrbit Geostationary Polar\n\nAltitude 30,000 km 800 km\n\nRelative flux 1 unit 1400 units\n\nMirror radius 20 cm 7.5 cm\n\nSampling time Programmable dwell (0e225)\n? 8 ms\n\nSingle glance 700 ms\n\nIGFOV 13.8 or 6.9 km 21.8 km\n\nNoise ?0.5K ?0.1K\nCoverage Programmable 15? latitude\n\nswath per 10 min\nSuborbital 30? longitude swath per\noverpass\n\nFrequency Programmable, e.g., 15-min\nintervals\n\nFixed every 12 h\n\nCalibration Space/internal blackbody\nforeoptics corrections\n\nSpace/external blackbody\n\nIR channels 12 total:\n5 CO2 @ 13e15 mm\n2 CO2, N2O @ 4.4e4.5 mm\n3 H2O @ 6.7, 7.2, 12.6 mm\n2 windows @ 11.2, 3.9 mm\n\n19 total:\n7 CO2 @ 13e15 mm\n5 CO2, N2O @ 4.2e4.5 mm\n3 H2O @ 6.7, 7.3, 8.3 mm\n3 windows @ 11.1, 4.0, 3.7 mm\n1 O3 @ 9.7 mm\n\nIGFOV, instantaneous geographic field of view.\n\n8.3 ATMOSPHERIC PROFILING 629\n\n\n\nsurface emissivity. AIRS\u2019s advanced technology makes it the most advanced water vapor sensor\never built. AIRS can also measure trace greenhouse gases such as ozone, carbon monoxide, carbon\ndioxide, and methane. Together these data and the attendant scientific investigations are answering\nlong-standing questions about the exchange and transformation of energy of radiation within the\natmosphere and at the Earth\u2019s surface. The Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation, established to\naccelerate the assimilation of satellite observations into operational weather forecast models,\nannounced a significant improvement in forecast skill achieved with the assimilation of AIRS data.\n\nThe AIRS instrument (Fig. 8.24) was built by BAE Systems for NASA/JPL and operates as a cross-\ntrack scanning instrument. Its scan mirror rotates around an axis along the line of flight and directs\ninfrared energy from the Earth into the instrument with the basic swath covering approximately\n800 km on either side of the nadir ground-track. The nadir spatial resolution is 13.5 km. There is also a\nset of VNIR detectors divided into four intermediate and broadband spectral channels. The VNIR\nspatial resolution is approximately 2.3 km. These channels provide a diagnostic imaging capability for\nobserving low-level clouds. AIRS uses a cooled (155K) grating spectrometer to separate the wave-\nlengths into fairly narrow wavebands across arrays of high sensitivity HgCdTe detectors. These IR\ndetectors are divided into 12 modules containing 17 linear arrays distributed in a two-dimensional\npattern on the cold focal plane. The detectors are of two types, photovoltaic (PV, up to 13.7 mm)\nand photoconductive (PC) for the 13.7 and 15.4 mm wavelengths.\n\nThe word sounder in the instrument\u2019s name means that its primary purpose is to measure tem-\nperature and water vapor as functions of atmospheric height. As noted earlier, AIRS also measures\n\nTable 8.7 Brightness Temperature Differences for VAS Versus HIRS for Three GOES Satellites\n\nVAS HIRS\n\nT* (HIRS Est.)

Using multiple infrared detectors, each\nsensing a specific wavelength, a temperature profile (or sounding) of the atmosphere can be observed.\nWhile prior profilers had 15 detectors, AIRS has 2378 of them, all of which are sampled simulta-\nneously. This simultaneity is an essential requirement for accurate temperature retrievals under partly\ncloudy conditions. Calibration is carried out each scan by views of onboard blackbody radiometric\ncalibration sources and of cold space, which greatly improves the sounding accuracy, making it\ncomparable to measurements made by weather balloons.\n\nThe high spectral infrared resolution of AIRS dramatically improves the vertical profile resolution,\nbut all infrared sensing degrades in the presence of clouds. The microwave AMSU and HSB in-\nstruments are insensitive to clouds and provide all-weather sounding to compliment the higher res-\nolution AIRS soundings. Thus, a system has been developed to combine AIRS, AMSU, and HAB data\nto routinely provide global information on the state of the atmosphere.\n\n8.4 RAIN RATE, ATMOSPHERIC LIQUID WATER, AND CLOUD\nLIQUID WATER\n\nRain rate can be estimated from different techniques. Microwave radiometers can provide the total\naveraged rain rate over the antenna footprint, and radars can provide the volumetric distribution of\nradar backscatter that can be related to the rain rate.\n\nFIGURE 8.24\n\nThe AIRS instrument (http://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/mission_and_instrument/instrument).\n\n8.4 RAIN RATE, ATMOSPHERIC LIQUID WATER, AND CLOUD LIQUID WATER 631\n\nhttp://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/mission_and_instrument/instrument\n\n\n8.4.1 RAIN RATE ESTIMATION USING MICROWAVE RADIOMETRY\nDue to the high emissivity of land, there is not much difference between the emission produced by the\nraindrops and the emission of the surface below the rain. Thus, emission-based techniques cannot be\nused to infer rain rate, but it can only be found from the dispersion it produces. On the other hand, the\nlow emissivity of the oceans makes the measurements taken in the lower frequency channels much\nsmaller, so a large dispersion would be required to obtain a positive scattering index (SI) between the\n22 and 85 GHz channels. The reader is encouraged to review Figs. 4.52, and 4.58e4.60 for a visual\ninterpretation of the processes involved.\n\n8.4.1.1 Precipitation Detection Over Ground Surfaces\nTo detect the presence of rain in the atmosphere, we rely on the fact that the dispersion created\nby precipitation is always larger at 85 than it is at 37 GHz, as it occurs in the case of snow. It is also\nimportant to filter iced soils, cold deserts, warm deserts . which is accomplished by setting\nthresholds (1) between the brightness temperatures at a given polarization, typically the vertical\npolarization, because around 53? incidence angle (incidence angle of most conical scanning ra-\ndiometers) it is less sensitive to surface roughness effects, and (2) between the brightness tem-\nperature at the same frequency, but at different polarizations (vertical minus horizontal). Once the\ndetection of the pixels where there is rain, the rain rate can be estimated in (mm/h) using different\nalgorithms. As an example, for illustration purposes, in the Ferraro algorithm the rain rate is\nestimated from the SI, which is defined in Eq. (8.10) as a combination of the SSM/I channels. The\nSI measures the difference between the predicted T85V from the T19V and T22V channel in rain free\nconditions over land, and the measured value of T85V. Note that the dependence with the 22 GHz\nchannel is quadratic and has opposite sign than the other linear terms, to compensate for the\nincreased attenuation due to the water vapor absorption:\n\nSI \u00bc 438:5? 0:46$T19V ? 1:735$T22V \u00fe 0:00589$T222V ? T85V ; (8.10)\nRR \u00f0mm=h\u00de \u00bc ?2:71\u00fe 0:362$SI. (8.11)\n\n8.4.1.2 Precipitation Detection Over the Ocean\nSince the ocean\u2019s emissivity is much lower than that of the land, the algorithm can be based on the\nrain emission. Liquid water produces a much stronger signal than ice. In addition, the microwave\nemission from the ocean surface is strongly polarized, while the emission from raindrops is unpo-\nlarized, which allows us to distinguish it from the ocean surface\u2019s emission using measurements at\nvertical and horizontal polarization. As in the previous case the rain rate is estimated from the SI\ncomputed as the difference between the predicted T85V from the T19V and T22V channel in rain free\nconditions over the ocean, and the measured value of T85V:\n\nSI \u00bc ?182:7\u00fe 0:75$T19V ? 2:543$T22V \u00fe 0:00543$T222V ? T85V ; (8.12)\nRR \u00f0mm=h\u00de \u00bc ?1:05\u00fe 0:149$SI. (8.13)\n\nGlobal rain rate maps are currently distributed by Remote Sensing Systems (http://www.remss.\ncom/measurements/rain-rate) using the more sophisticated Hilburn and Wentz (2008) algorithm,\nand data from the SSM/I, SSMIS, TMI, AMSR-E, AMSR-2, and WindSat missions.\n\n632 CHAPTER 8 ATMOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\nhttp://www.remss.com/measurements/rain-rate\nhttp://www.remss.com/measurements/rain-rate\n\n\nBecause of the strong water vapor absorption line near 22 GHz, microwave radiometers can also\nmeasure the atmospheric water vapor (total column water vapor, or total precipitable water) over the\noceans, which is a measure of the total gaseous water contained in a vertical column of atmosphere,\nand it is measured in linear units (mm), as would be the depth of the water if it condensed to liquid\nform.\n\nAt 18 and 37 GHz, clouds are semitransparent allowing for measurement of the total columnar\nabsorption. After accounting for oxygen and water vapor absorption, the absorption can be related to the\ntotal amount of liquid water in the viewing path. The cloud liquid water is then a measure of the total\nliquid water contained in a cloud in a vertical column of the atmosphere, excluding solid water (e.g.,\nsnow, ice), it is a very variable measure which depends on the type of clouds, and it is measured in\n(g/m3) or (g/kg), or also in (mm) as the depth of water in a column. The liquid water content is always\none or two orders of magnitude lower than the content of water vapor. Sometimes it is also called liquid\nwater in clouds, because it is the main responsible parameter for low altitude clouds, which are\ndominant in the marine meteorology of the first kilometer of the atmosphere. It can be computed as:\n\nLWC\n?\nkg\n\n?\nm2\n\n? \u00bc 131:95? 39:5$log\u00f0280? T22V\u00de \u00fe 12:49$log\u00f0280? T37V\u00de. (8.14)\nThese variables are also routinely distributed by Remote Sensing Systems through their online\n\nservers (http://www.remss.com/measurements/atmospheric-water-vapor and http://www.remss.com/\nmeasurements/cloud-liquid-water-content).\n\n8.4.2 RAIN RATE ESTIMATION USING RADAR\nIn Chapter 5, the basic radar equation was presented. In the monostatic case, it provides the returned\npower Pr from a given target of \u201cradar cross-section\u201d s, as:\n\nPr \u00bc Pt$G\n2$l2$s\n\n\u00f04$p\u00de3$R4 ; (8.15)\n\nwhere Pt is the transmitted power, G is the antenna gain, l is the electromagnetic wavelength, and R is\nthe distance from the radar to the target. In the case of a volumetric target, the \u201cradar cross-section\u201d s\nbecomes the product of the volume observed by the radar, times the radar cross-section volumetric\ndensity (h). Since the volume observed by the radar is equal to its resolution cell, then:\n\ns \u00bc c\n2B\n\n$\u00f0R$DqH\u00de$\u00f0R$DqV\u00de$h; (8.16)\n\nwhere B is the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, DqH and DqV are the antenna beam widths in the\nhorizontal and vertical planes. Note that, inserting Eq. (8.16) in Eq. (8.15), now the dependence with\ndistance becomes as 1/R2, as opposed to 1/R4 for point targets. This is due to the fact that the radar\nresolution cell increases with the distance.\n\nHowever, raindrops are not of the same size. The wavelengths used in rain radars (1e10 cm) ensure\nthe validity of Rayleigh scattering criterion for all raindrops, so that the radar returns are proportional\nto the rain rate. The reflectivity measured by the radar (Ze) varies by the sixth power of the rain\ndroplets\u2019 diameter (D), the square of the dielectric constant (K) of the targets, and the drop size\ndistribution. For a Marshall-Palmer (1948) distribution, this gives:\n\nZe \u00bc\nZ Dmax\n0\n\njKj2$N0$e?L$D$D6$dD. (8.17)\n\n8.4 RAIN RATE, ATMOSPHERIC LIQUID WATER, AND CLOUD LIQUID WATER 633\n\nhttp://www.remss.com/measurements/atmospheric-water-vapor\nhttp://www.remss.com/measurements/cloud-liquid-water-content\nhttp://www.remss.com/measurements/cloud-liquid-water-content\n\n\nOn the other hand, the rain rate (RR), depends on the number of particles, their volume and their fall\nspeed [v(D)] as:\n\nRR \u00bc\nZ Dmax\n0\n\nN0$e\n?L$D$\n\npD3\n\n6\n$v\u00f0D\u00de$dD. (8.18)\n\nSince both have similar functional expressions, the relationship between them can be expressed as:\n\nZ \u00bc a$RRb; (8.19)\nwhere a and b depend on the type of precipitation. In rain radars, the radar reflectivity is expressed in\ndBZ (10 times the base 10 logarithm of the ratio of the radar return to the radar return of a standard\n1 mm diameter drop filling the same scanned volume). Typical values range from 65 dBZ (extremely\nheavy precipitation, possible hail) to 20 dBZ (light precipitation). Modern weather radars are pulse-\nDoppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to the intensity of the\nprecipitation, and estimate its type (rain, snow, hail, etc.).\n\nFIGURE 8.25\n\nRain radar composite image for the Iberian peninsula (August 29, 2016 at 17:00 h local time).

While satellites are critical components of open ocean autonomous\nocean profiling systems, satellite-borne sensors cannot penetrate very far into the ocean itself. Satellite\naltimeters measure the ocean\u2019s surface and its variations and therefore reflect a vertical integral, but\nstill the altimetric signal does not penetrate into the interior of the ocean. Ocean color may penetrate a\nfew tens of meters into the upper layer of the ocean, but that is about the deepest any spaceborne sensor\npenetrates into the ocean.\n\nThat said there is plenty of information available from satellite sensors that is relevant to\nprocesses that link the ocean and atmosphere and contribute to the Earth\u2019s climate system. The sea\nsurface temperature (SST) of the ocean is one of the oldest ocean measurements that has been\ncollected, but the shift to satellite SST has changed the way we sense SST and thus its relationship to\nthe climate puzzle. Satellite SST sensing itself varies between infrared (IR) sensing of SST and\npassive microwave sensing of SST. Other important ocean surface sensing parameters are ocean\ncolor to map biological activity, ocean surface wind stress, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)\nimages to map currents and winds.\n\n9.1 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE\nThe first ocean parameter to be observed routinely was the SST. Originally this was a temperature\nmeasurement of a bucket sample of surface water taken on a sailing ship or a direct SST measurement\nfrom a coastal observing station. Such measurements were routinely collected in the mid-to-late 18th\ncentury. During this time shipboard measurements evolved from water samples taken in a wooden\nbucket (Fig. 9.1) to one taken with a smaller and folding canvas bucket. This change introduced SST\nerrors due to different on-deck cooling conditions for the canvas bucket relative to the better insulation\nof the wooden bucket. As a result, shipboard SSTs measured between the late 1980s and 1940s had a\ncool bias introduced by this cooling effect.\n\nIn the 1950s faster powered vessels made it necessary to give up collecting water samples and\nshift the SST measurement to measuring the temperature of the cooling water for the ship\u2019s engines.\nAn analog measurement taken by \u201ceye\u201d in a very warm engine room has introduced a warm bias in\nship-based SSTs (Fig. 9.2) that had to be compensated for in creating a climatological time series.\nThis engine intake cooling water temperature measurement was called an \u201cinjection\u201d temperature\nsince the temperature sensor was inserted into the cooling water circulation system. It seems only\nappropriate that the first parameter to be widely and routinely collected by spaceborne sensor would\nbe SST.\n\nCHAPTER\n\nIntroduction to Satellite Remote Sensing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809254-5.00009-9\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

These early IR images evolved into a more sophisticated system that used\ncombinations of channels to correct for atmospheric attenuation of the IR signal from the ocean\u2019s\nsurface (McClain et al., 1985). The first sensor used routinely for SST calculations was the scanning\nradiometer (SR), which provided the basic information used as input for the GOSSTCOMP system.\nThe SSTs from this system were not found to be very realistic when compared with in situ SST\nmeasurements.\n\nThe SR flew on the now operational National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\nsatellites, which were copies of the Improved Television InfraRed Observing Satellite (TIROS)\nOperational Satellite (ITOS) providing three-axes stabilization. Another instrument that flew on these\nsatellites was the very high resolution radiometer. This instrument added more channels and a higher\nspatial resolution, about 1 km. While operated only as an experimental instrument it was soon apparent\nthat they instrument provided the information that would be really needed to measure IR SST thus\nsetting the stage for future satellites which carried something known as the advanced very high\nresolution radiometer (AVHRR) which then flew on the TIROS-N series of satellites. This AVHRR\nbecame a workhorse instrument for satellite SST that continued for more than 20 years.\n\n9.1.2 THE ADVANCED VERY HIGH RESOLUTION RADIOMETER\nThe AVHRR is a four- or five-channel visibleethermal IR radiometer with a nadir resolution of 1.1 km\nwhich stretches out to about 6 km at the edge of scan. The channel locations and widths are shown here\nin Fig. 9.3 in comparison with channels from other radiometers. They are also spelled out in Table 9.1.\n\n(A) (B)\n\nFIGURE 9.1\n\nWooden (A) and canvas (B) surface water sample buckets.\n\n638 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThese channels have changed slightly over time with the first AVHRRs having only four channels.\nThe addition of channel 5 provided an additional thermal IR channel to correct the IR SST for at-\nmospheric water vapor attenuation of the IR signal. Later channel 3 was split into a 1.6-mm channel\nduring the day, which switched back to 3.7 mm at night. Remember in a polar orbit the satellite goes\nfrom day to night every 45 min. This additional 1.6-mm channel improved cloud property mapping\nduring the daylight hours. The applications for these various channels are listed here in Table 9.1.\n\nNote this list is for the latest version of the AVHRR, which has the switched channel 3. It is\nimportant to note that this channel also contributes to SST, but at nighttime when the 3.7-mm channel\nis available. During the daytime, it is not used in the SST formulation.\n\n1850 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975\n\n1850 1875 1900 1925 1950 1975\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n\u20130.2\n\n\u20130.4\n\n\u20130.6\n\n\u20130.8\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n\u20131.2\n\nYear \n\nYear \n\nA\nno\n\nm\nal\n\ny \nin\n\n D\neg\n\n C\nA\n\nno\nm\n\nal\ny \n\nin\n D\n\neg\n C\n\nNorthern Hemisphere\n\nwarm bias due to ship\nengine room SSTs\n\ncold bias due to canvas buckets\n\nSouthern Hemisphere\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n\u20130.2\n\n\u20130.4\n\n\u20130.6\n\n\u20130.8\n\n0\n\n\u20131\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\nFIGURE 9.2\n\nTime series of ship sea surface temperatures (SSTs) between 1850 and 1990.

Instead the backplane of the housing was\nhoneycombed and painted black. It was equipped with six thermistors to measure the temperature of\nthis pseudo-blackbody for real-time temperature calibration of the thermal IR channels. This had the\nnegative factor that the backplane was not uniform in its temperature and therefore did not present a\nuniform target to the optics as an ideal blackbody. In spite of these limitations the overwhelming\navailability of AVHRR data made it a prime source of SST measurements.\n\nFirst launched on the TIROS-N satellite in 1978 in a test configuration, the AVHRR became the\noperational imager on the TIROS-N series of satellites starting with NOAA-6 in 1979. The first\nAVHRR was a four-channel radiometer, which included channels 1, 2, 3B, and 4 of Table 9.1. This\nversion of the AVHRR flew on NOAA satellites 6, 8, and 10. NOAA 7, 9, 11, 12, and 14 carried the\nAVHRR2, which added channel 5 in Table 9.1. Finally, the AVHRR3 on NOAA 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19\nhas the full number of channels listed in Table 9.1.\n\nThis time series is also documented here in Table 9.2, which shows the evolution of the NOAA\nsatellites over time. It demonstrates the transition from the alpha designation given to the satellites\nwhen they were first built to a numeric designation when they were deployed on orbit. It is clear that\nthere is not a one-to-one relationship between the alpha designations and the numeric ones. This is due\nto the fact that some of the NOAA satellites did not achieve orbit and thus were never commissioned as\noperational spacecraft. NOAA-13 however did achieve orbit was considered operational, but then\n\nOPTICAL\nSUBSYSTEM\n\nRADIANT\nCOOLER\n\nSUBSYSTEM\nBASEPLATE\n\nSCANNER\nSUBSYSTEM\n\nELECTRONICS\nSUBSYSTEM\n\nFIGURE 9.4\n\nThe advanced very high resolution radiometer.\n\n9.1 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE 641\n\n\n\nsuffered a massive power failure while on orbit which killed the mission. At this time NOAA had a \u201cno\nsafe hold\u201d policy for their satellites, which resulted in a complete satellite failure, which started in a\nsingle unit and then spread via the central electronics bus to all of the other satellite systems. A \u201cfailure\nreview board\u201d for this failure learned that the initial failure was due to an overtightened screw that\nshorted out a single system leading to a failure of the entire satellite.\n\n9.1.3 ADVANCED VERY HIGH RESOLUTION RADIOMETER PATHFINDER SEA\nSURFACE TEMPERATURE\n\nOne of the main SST products derived from these data was the NOAA-NASA pathfinder SST (PFSST)\nproduct produced originally by the remote sensing group at the University of Miami. In this algorithm\nthe ocean surface is assumed to emit almost as a blackbody, and without an absorbing and emitting\natmosphere between the sea surface and the satellite it would be possible to estimate SSTusing a single\nIR channel observation. The reality is that the atmosphere attenuates surface-leaving IR radiance\nbefore it reaches a satellite sensor. It is therefore necessary to make corrections for atmospheric effects.\nWater vapor, CO2, CH4, NO, and aerosols are the major atmospheric constituents that cause the\nextinction of IR radiance (Minnett, 1990). Among these, the attenuation due to water vapor accounts\nfor most of the needed atmospheric correction (Barton et al., 1989).\n\nVarious methods have been proposed to correct for atmospheric moisture attenuation to produce\naccurate retrievals of SST. One dominant solution is to use the radiance difference of two slightly\n\nTable 9.2 Evolution of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\nSatellites Over Time\n\nOn Orbit Name Before Launch Launch Date AVHRR Version End of Mission\n\nTIROS-N TIROS-N October, 1978 1 February 27, 1981\n\nNOAA-6 NOAA-A June 1979 1 November 11, 1986\n\nNOAA-7 NOAA-C June 1981 2 June 7, 1986\n\nNOAA-8 NOAA-E March 1983 1 October 31, 1985\n\nNOAA-9 NOAA-F December 1984 2 November 5, 1994\n\nNOAA-10 NOAA-G September 1986 1 October 2000\n\nNOAA-11 NOAA-H September 1988 2 September 13, 1994\n\nNOAA-12 NOAA-D May 1991 1 August 10, 2007\n\nNOAA-13 NOAA-I August 1993 Failed after launch\n\nNOAA-14 NOAA-J December 1994 2 October 03, 2001\n\nNOAA-15 NOAA-K May 1998 3 AM operational, secondary\n\nNOAA-16 NOAA-L September 2000 3 PM operational, secondary\n\nNOAA-17 NOAA-M June 2002 3 AM operational, backup\n\nNOAA-18 NOAA-N May 2005 3 PM operational, secondary\n\nNOAA-19 NOAA-N0 February 2009 3 PM operational, primary\nMETOP-Aa METOP-A October 2006 3 AM operational, primary\n\nTIROS, televsion infrared observing satellite.\naOperated by EUMETSAT.\n\n642 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\ndifferent wavelength thermal IR channels to estimate the water vapor attenuation (Anding and Kauth,\n1970). Using differences in brightness temperatures (BTs) measured by an earlier satellite radiometer,\nPrabhakara et al. (1974) were able to estimate SST to within a reasonable accuracy. Barton (1995)\nreviewed a number of SST algorithms all of which used this IR channel difference to correct for\natmospheric moisture attenuation in the form\n\nSST \u00bc a$Ti \u00fe g\u00f0Ti ? Tj\u00de \u00fe c; (9.1)\nwhere Ti and Tj are BT measurements in channels i and j and a and c are constants. The g term is\ndefined as\n\ng \u00bc 1? ti\nti ? tj ; (9.2)\n\nwhere t is the transmittance through the atmosphere from the surface to the satellite. In cases of weak\nabsorption, the transmittance can be approximated by \u00f01? k$u\u00de, where k is the absorption due to\natmospheric absorbers, and u is the path length through the atmosphere (Barton, 1995).\n\nAll AVHRR SST algorithms have the same general form described in Eq. (9.1) although various\nmodifications have been introduced through the years with changes in channels and satellites sensors.\nMcClain et al. (1985) developed SST algorithms based on linear differences between thermal IR\nAVHRR channels. Known as the multichannel sea surface temperature or MCSST this algorithm\nassumed a constant channel difference between different AVHRR instruments. This MCSST became\nNOAA\u2019s first operational SST product (McClain et al., 1985) with future algorithm improvements\nincluding a correction for increased path lengths at larger satellite zenith angles (Cornillon et al.,\n1987). Subsequent improvements in atmospheric correction involved nonlinear formulations where\nthe difference in the longwave IR channels was considered proportional to the BTs, as in the cross-\nproduct SST (CPSST) described by Walton (1988) and Walton et al. (1990).\n\nThat this \u201csplit-window\u201d SST algorithm may not be the optimal correction to thermal IR SST due\nto atmospheric water vapor attenuation (WVSST) was discussed by Emery et al. (1994) where they use\nindependent estimates of atmospheric water vapor from coincident measurements by the special sensor\nmicrowave imager (SSM/I) to correct for atmospheric water vapor absorption for AVHRR data. They\napplied their algorithm to data from the South Pacific and the Norwegian Sea and then compared the\nresults with coincident measurements of both skin and bulk SST. In addition, a quadratic SST\nformulation is tested against the in situ SSTs. While the quadratic formulation provided a considerable\nimprovement over the CPSST and the MCSST, the WVSST showed overall smaller errors when\ncompared to both the skin and bulk in situ SSTobservations. Applied to individual AVHRR images the\nWVSST-CPSST difference reveals a water vapor pattern consistent with that from the SSMI/I itself.\nThe quadratic SST was found to underestimate the SST corrections in the lower latitudes and over-\nestimate the corrections in the high latitudes.\n\nThe most recent version of the channel combination algorithm is now the NOAA operational\nalgorithm called the nonlinear SST (NLSST) where the starting SST is assumed to be proportional to a\nfirst-guess SST value (usually from the earlier MCSST). The AVHRR Oceans Pathfinder SST\nalgorithm is based on the NLSST algorithm developed by Walton et al. (1998). This NLSST algorithm\nhas the following form:\n\nSST \u00bc a\u00fe b$T4 \u00fe c\u00f0T4 ? T5\u00de$SSTMCSST \u00fe d\u00f0T4 ? T5\u00de$sec\u00f0r? 1\u00de; (9.3)\n\n9.1 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE 643\n\n\n\nwhere SST is the satellite-derived SST and T4 and T5 are the AVHRR BTs in AVHRR channels 4 and\n5, respectively, and SSTMCSST is an SST first guess usually computed as the MCSST described\nabove. The satellite zenith angle is given by the last term and coefficients a, b, c, r, and d are\nestimated from regression analyses using colocated in situ and satellite measurements (called\nmatchups). Typically, NOAA produces sets of coefficients using matchups for certain periods and the\ncoefficients would not be changed unless there was a significant need. A good example is the need to\nchange algorithm coefficients after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in June 1991, which introduced a\nlarge amount of atmospheric aerosols. Whenever a new AHVRR instrument is launched into orbit a\nnew set of coefficients needs to be introduced so that Eq. (9.3) depends on the specific satellite\nsensor.\n\nSST algorithm coefficients can be derived in two fundamentally different ways. Historically,\ncoefficients were found by matching satellite values with nearly coincident in situ SST measure-\nments (earlier ships and later drifting/moored buoys). This approach mixes the satellite IR radiances,\nwhich respond only to the IR emissions of skin SSTwith the in situ measurements of bulk SST made\nby the ships and buoys. The other method of SST algorithm coefficient estimation uses radiative\nmodel simulations to derive a set of atmospheric profiles to estimate the atmospheric attenuation\nthen giving the estimate of the skin SST observed directly by the satellite BTs. This skin SST is\nfundamentally different from the subsurface bulk SST as discussed by Wick et al. (1992). This skin\nSST represents the 10-mm-thin upper layer of the ocean and is the temperature controlling the IR\nemissions, which are detected by the satellite sensor. An operational version of this approach has\nbeen used by the along-track scanning radiometer (ATSR, Llewellyn-Jones et al., 1993; Zavody\net al., 1995), which then regressed the simulated satellite BTs against in situ measured SSTs (buoy\nSSTs) to derive SST algorithm coefficients. Considered as a \u201csemiphysical\u201d approach, this method\nresulted in an estimate of the skin SST.\n\nThe PFSST product used the direct regression of the satellite BTs against nearly coincident in situ\nmeasurements of bulk SST. In the PFSST the in situ matchup SSTs that were used to derive the SST\ncoefficients are distributed together with the global SSTs. For the PFSST there are very tight\nspaceetime constraints: in situ and satellite observations are considered as coincident if they occur\nwithin ?30 min and ?0.1 degree of latitude and longitude. In addition, the pathfinder matchup\ndatabase has been very carefully screened to exclude the most cloud-contaminated matchups from the\nSST coefficient estimation procedure. Only these relatively cloud-free matchups were used in the\ncomputation of the SST algorithm coefficients. The availability of the matchup in situ SSTs make it\npossible for the user to check the accuracy of the SST algorithm coefficients.\n\nFor the PFSST, some modifications to the NLSST were made. Studies of early versions of the\nPFSST revealed a correlation between the (T4 ? T5) temperature difference and the SST estimate\nitself, which suggested that this atmospheric correction was different for dry and moist atmospheres.\nThere seemed to be low (T4 ? T5) values associated with a positive bias in SST residuals (low SST\nestimates) that was true for all satellite zenith angles. This is consistent with Emery et al. (1994) who\nstudied the effects of atmospheric moisture on the SST residuals using atmospheric water vapor\ncomputed independently from microwave radiometry data. There is also a strong indication that the\nfunctional relationship between (T4 ? T5) and SST changes markedly at 0.7e1.0?C. Thus suggests\nthat there is a fundamental change in the balance between the various radiance sources sensed by the\nAVHRR (emitted ocean surface radiance versus atmospheric moisture content) as a function of\n\n644 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\natmospheric moisture itself. In addition, atmospheric absorbers and scatterers other than water vapor\nbecome more important in drier atmospheres.\n\nIn an effort to capture this change in functional relationship the PFSST implemented a\n\u201cpiecewise\u201d fit to the derivation of SST algorithm coefficients. SST algorithm coefficients were\nestimated for low, and intermediate to high (T4 ? T5) values. The boundary between these two\natmospheric regimes was selected to be (T4 ? T5) \u00bc 0.7?C. To avoid discontinuities in the global\nPFSST fields as the algorithm coefficient changed, they implemented another modification to the\nselection of algorithm coefficients. Early versions of the PFSST used a single set of SST algorithm\ncoefficients, but an analysis of the resulting SST suggested a dependence on temporal trends in\nalgorithm performance. These temporal trends included a variety of time scales ranging from\nseasonal [e.g., higher root mean squared (RMS) and bias in SST residuals during Northern Hemi-\nsphere summers] to interannual (differences between years). No clear cause was found for this\ninterannual variability, which may stem from the gradual degradation of an individual AVHRR\ninstrument. As an example during the later stages of both NOAA-9 and NOAA-11 operational\nlifetimes, the baseplate upon which the onboard calibration targets are mounted was operated at a\nmuch higher ambient temperature than was used in previous years (this was also higher than the\ntemperatures used for prelaunch sensor characterization).\n\nAs stated in the PFSST guide the design goals for the AVHRR thermal IR channels were a noise\nequivalent differential temperature of 0.12K at 300K, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1 at 0.5% albedo\n(Kidwell, 1997). Using the calibration technique developed by Brown et al. (1985), the overall\ncalibration error estimate for the thermal IR channels as derived from the prelaunch thermal vacuum\ntest is ?0.2K. In an effort to develop a consistent set of in-flight calibration algorithms for channels 4\nand 5, a radiance-based correction procedure was developed to account for the nonlinear response\ncharacteristics of the detectors. This procedure resulted in a consistent algorithm applied over the\nentire range of the AVHRR operating temperatures. This correction constituted a significant\nimprovement over the operational NOAA SST algorithm.\n\nA large validation data set was also available consisting primarily of drifting and moored\nbuoys measuring SST. The procedure for using these data is presented here in Fig. 10.5. Here the\nnumber in each box indicates the sequence with which it is carried out. The abbreviation TCAP\nrefers to the transaction capabilities application part, which embedded in each SST report pro-\nvided by a drifting or moored buoy. It verifies the status of the SST subsystem on each particular\nplatform. Thus, it is used as a filter to remove SSTs reported from buoys, which have faulty SST\nsubsystems.\n\nNote that in step 5 there is a matchup criterion for the spaceetime window in which an in situ\nmeasurement is matched up with a satellite radiance. Finally, cloud-contaminated matchups are\nremoved before the matchup statistics are generated. Since most of these in situ SST data come\nfrom data archives, one must perform various levels of quality control to sort out the best in situ\nSSTs for matchups with the satellite radiances. As a result, the pathfinder program (Fig. 9.5) did not\ncarry out any additional quality control to further filter out erroneous buoy SST data. One exception\nwas to correct for known errors in buoy location. These consistency checks were initially developed\nby Reynolds and Smith (1994). The in situ SST reports were converted to a continuous time\ncoordinate, which became known as \u201cpathfinder time.\u201d This pathfinder time took into account leap\ndays, but not leap seconds. Since the matchup conditions were computed from this continuous\n\n9.1 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE 645\n\n\n\nPathfinder Time there may be small round off errors in the original in situ time that should not\nintroduce errors any larger than 1 s.\n\nThe PFSST dataset is global as it is based on NOAA global area coverage (GAC) data that collected\nglobally for each polar-orbiting satellite every day. While the instrument has a 1 km field of view\n(FOV) for the GAC data, four of every five samples along the scan line are averaged and the data from\nevery third scan line are processed. The result is a spatial resolution that is nominally referred to as\n4 km.\n\nIt should be noted that in spite of this global coverage persistent cloud cover results in many areas\nnot being covered by a daily PFSST (Fig. 9.6). It can be seen here that in the polar regions clouds\nobscure most of the SST field while there are many other areas such as the tropical zones where cloud\ncover also dramatically reduces the SST coverage.\n\nIn situ data AVHRR/GAC data\n\nMatchups\n\nAncillary\ndata\n\n Compile/reformat\nin situ SST\n\nobservations\n\n(1) (3)\nExtract AVHRR counts\n\nfor 5\u00d75 box around\nin situ observations\n\nReduced list of\nin situ times/locations\n\nfor AVHRR extractions \n\n(2)\nFilter in situ\n\nobservations using\nTCAP \n\n(4)\nCalibrate AVHRR\n\ncounts to brightness \ntemperatures/albedos\n\n(5)\nMatchup\n\nin situ and AVHRR data\nwithin given\n\ntime/space window\n\n(6)\nFlag cloud-contaminated\n\nmatchups\n\n(7)\nAdd ancillary data\n\nFIGURE 9.5\n\nAdvanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) matchup data processing stream.

The highest spatial resolution grid is\nnominally referred to as a 9 km grid and it has 4096 ? 360 pixels per degree of longitude and latitude.\nCalled the 18 km grid, values are also provided with a spatial resolution of 2048 ? 360 pixels per\nlatitudeelongitude degree. Finally, the lower spatial resolution is approximately 54 km with a\n720 ? 360 pixel per degree resolution.\n\nThe PFSST product has made a transition from production at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and\nAtmospheric Science at the University of Miami to production and archival at the National\nOceanographic Data Center (NODC). The goal is to have NODC provide this SST as a long-term\nclimate data record going back to 1981 with the advent of the NOAA-7 satellite and its early\nAVHRR. This transition includes modernizing the PFSST processing code into a package; this is\ncompatible with the NODC data archive architecture and easily scalable from large institutional data\ncenters down to single individuals who wish to further improve on the PFSST in the future. This\ntransition also requires software and analysis packages for the continued quality control of the\nassociated matchup database. Formal documents will include a PFSST user\u2019s guide and a sustaining\noperations plan so that NODC personnel can continue the production of the PFSST consistent with\nwhat has been done in the past. The need to perpetuate the legacy of the AVHRR PFSST is\nemphasized that this sensor will continue to operate on US and European platforms well into 2024\nand longer.\n\nFIGURE 9.6\n\nNOAA/NASA advanced very high resolution radiometer Oceans Pathfinder sea surface temperature;\n\nDescending Pass December 30, 1995.\n\n9.1 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE 647\n\n\n\n9.1.4 PASSIVE MICROWAVE SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE\nIn their review, Gentemann et al. (2010) provide the history of microwave radiometry sensing of\nSST. They point out that satellite microwave radiometers provide not only SST, but simultaneously\nwind speed, water vapor, cloud liquid water, rain rate, and now even sea surface salinity (SSS).\nDesigned to measure rainfall the first microwave radiometer was launched into space in December\n1972 on the Nimbus-5 satellite. The first instrument specifically designed to measure SST was the\nscanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR) carried first on the short-lived SeaSat\nsatellite and then on Nimbus-7 (from October 1978 to August 1987). Due to some calibration\nproblems SSTs were not terribly accurate from the SMMR.\n\nThe next microwave sensor widely used for SSTwas not originally designed for this purpose. The\nmicrowave imager on the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission (TRMM) was originally designed to\nmeasure atmospheric moisture and at 10 GHz was a bit too high in frequency to be very sensitive to\nSST emission. In addition, the TRMM satellite was placed in an orbit that restricted its measure-\nment to 40?N to 40?S. The TRMM microwave imager (TMI) was designed to provide quantitative\nrainfall information over a wide swath width of 760 km. The TMI carefully measures the tiny\namounts of microwave energy emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere, and it is able to quantify the\nwater vapor, the cloud water, and the rainfall intensity in the atmosphere. An important feature of\nmicrowave retrievals is that SSTs can be measured through clouds, which are nearly transparent at\n10.7 GHz. This is a great advantage over the IR SSTobservations that require a cloud-free FOV. With\nTMI, it is now possible to view ocean areas with persistent cloud coverage. TRMM\u2019s lower altitude\n(350 km) results in TMI having improved ground resolution, which is 45 km for the 10.7 GHz\nchannel used for SST.\n\nThe TMI instrument is calibrated by viewing a \u201cwarm load\u201d and then cold space to provide\ncalibration values for each conical scan. The temperature of the warm load is monitored by three\nthermistors while the cold reflector views the cosmic microwave background at 2.7 K. TMI is capable\nof measuring SST using these calibration references. TMI suffered calibration problems due to an\nemissive sky reflector, for which corrections were developed and implemented making the TMI SSTs\nquite reliable.\n\nThe next most important microwave radiometer was the Japanese Space Agency\u2019s (JAXA)\nadvanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR-E) which is onboard NASA\u2019s AQUA satellite,\nlaunched in May 2002. AMSR-E had 12 channels corresponding to the six frequencies 6.9, 10.7, 18.7,\n23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 GHz. All of these except 23.8 GHz were both vertical and horizontally polarized\n(Parkinson, 2003). The 23.8 GHz channel was only vertically polarized and was intended to estimate\nthe atmospheric water vapor content. The instrument calibration was similar to the TMI using a cold\nreflector pointed out to space and a hot absorber with eight thermistors. The AMSR-E hot load had\nlarge thermal gradients not well measured by the thermistors. A correction for this error in the\ncalibration reference point had been developed and implemented. SST was primarily computed from\nthe 6.9 GHz channel.\n\nIn an effort to demonstrate the retrieval of ocean wind speed and direction the Naval Research\nLaboratory launched the Coriolis satellite in January 2003, which carried theWindSat instrument. This\ninstrument has fully polarimetric channels at 10.7, 18.7, and 37.0 GHz, and vertical and horizontal\npolarization channels at 6.8 and 23.8 GHz. Calibration is similar to the other two instruments with a\n\n648 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\ncold space reflector and a hot absorber measured by six thermistors. Again, while this instrument was\nnot designed to measure SST, its data can be used to map microwave SST.\n\nCalibration is often a problem with microwave radiometers. The cold reflector is relatively trouble-\nfree as long as problems with reflector emissions are avoided. Occasionally the reflector will not point\nto cold space, but to the Moon instead. These values must be removed from the data.\n\nThe hot absorber has proven to be a lot more problematic particularly since the thermistors\noften do not adequately measure thermal gradients across the hot absorber. A hot load correction\nis needed for AMSR-E because of a design flaw. The hot reference acts as a blackbody emitter\nand its temperature is measured by precision thermistors. Unfortunately, during the course of an\norbit, larger thermal gradients develop as the satellite transitions from night into day due to solar\nheating making it difficult to determine the average effective temperature from the thermistors.\nThe thermistors themselves measure these temperature gradients and may vary up to 15K between\nthem for any given time for AMSR-E. Radiative transfer modeling simulations are used to\ndetermine the effective hot load temperature as a function of the measured hot load thermistor\ntemperatures.\n\nThe main reflector is also a potential source of calibration error. It is generally assumed to be\na perfect reflector with an emissivity of 0, but this may not always be true. A bias in the TMI\nmeasurements was attributed to a degradation of the primary reflector. At TMI\u2019s relatively low-altitude\n(350 km) atomic oxygen present in this part of the troposphere led to a rapid oxidization of the thin,\nvapor-deposited aluminum coating of the graphite primary reflector resulting in a much higher antenna\nemissivity than was expected from the prelaunch calibration. This emissivity was determined to be\n3.5% and is constant for all of the TMI channels.\n\nGeophysical parameters are retrieved from the microwave channel data using a radiative transfer\nmodel to derive a regression algorithm (Wentz, 1998; Meissner and Wentz, 2012). A large ensemble of\nocean-atmosphere scenes is first assembled and atmospheric conditions are specified using a set of\nquality-controlled radiosonde profiles launched from small islands (Wentz, 1997). Half of these\nradiosonde profiles are used to derive the regression algorithm while the other half are withheld for\ntesting the algorithm. A cloud layer of various columnar water densities ranging from 0 to 0.3 mm is\nsuperimposed on the radiosonde profiles. A rough sea surface is placed beneath these simulated\natmospheres. With these simulated conditions SST is randomly varied from 0 to 30?C, the wind speed\nis randomly varied from 0 to 20 m/s, and the wind direction is randomly varied from 0 to 360 degrees.\n\nAtmospheric BTs and transmittances are computed from these scenes and noise appropriate to\nthe measurement noise expected (which depends on spatial resolution) is added. The noise-added\nsimulated BTs along with the known environmental scene are used to generate multiple linear\nregression coefficients. The algorithm is tested by repeating this process with the withheld parameter\nvalues.\n\nBetween 4 and 11 GHz the vertically polarized BT of the ocean surface is sensitive to SST. BT at\nthese frequencies is also influenced by the sea surface roughness and on the atmospheric temperature\nand moisture profiles. Fortunately, the spectral signatures of the surface roughness and the atmo-\nsphere are quite distinct from that of SST making it possible to remove the influence of these effects\ngiven the multiple frequencies and polarizations available. Both TMI and AMSR-E measure mul-\ntiple frequencies that are more than adequate to remove the competing surface-roughness and\n\n9.1 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE 649\n\n\n\natmospheric profile effects. Sea-surface roughness is usually parameterized in terms of wind speed\nand direction. For AMSR-E the additional 6.9 GHz channel provides an additional estimate of sea-\nsurface roughness and improved accuracy of SST less than 12?C. All of the channels together are\nused to simultaneously retrieve SST, wind speed, columnar water vapor, cloud liquid water, and rain\nrate (Wentz and Meissner, 2000). Microwave SST retrievals are not possible in regions of sun-glitter\nand near land (which depends on the microwave spot size, which at the low SST frequencies is quite\nlarge). Over the rest of the ocean the ability of the microwave to view the ocean surface through\ncloud cover results in almost complete global coverage daily. Errors in wind speed, water vapor,\ncloud liquid water can contribute to errors in the retrieved SST.\n\nRemote Sensing Systems Inc. performs the SST microwave retrievals using moored buoy SSTs\nfrom the TOGA-Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) buoy network in addition to the Pilot Research\n(PIRATA) moored buoy array in the tropical Atlantic. The nighttime mean differences, mean satellite\nminus buoy SST differences, and standard deviations (STDs) for each of the buoy arrays are presented\nhere in Table 9.3.\n\nWhile the biases are very small the STDs are about 0.5?C which is less accurate than the IR SST\nthat often has an STD of about 0.15?C. Thus, while the microwave radiometry SST has the all-weather\nsensing advantage it also has the drawbacks of poor spatial resolution (w50 km), and it is a bit less\naccurate in terms of absolute temperature.\n\nNear land, the side lobes of the microwave antenna pattern can result in side lobe contamination as\nstray signals make it in to the observational data stream. This effect is clearly going to be geography\ndependent as it occurs only where there is sufficient land to contaminate the microwave SST retrieval.\nIt should be noted that, because of the larger footprint, the 10.7 GHz channel is much more affected by\nland emissions, which results in a warm bias and small increase in STD for both the TMI and the\nAMSR-E near land, but the effect is substantially greater for TMI which only has the 10.7 GHz\nchannel that is less affected by the nearby land than is the 6.9 GHz channel.\n\nThe TRMM satellite also carries a visible infrared radiometer scanner (VIRS) from which IR\nSST estimates can be made, which were found to have a STD of 0.7?C when compared to Reynolds\noptimal interpolated SSTs (Ricciardulli and Wentz, 2004). The mean difference of SST observations\naway from land is about 0.12?C that is approximately the difference that would be expected between\nthe IR skin (VIRS) SST and the subskin (TMI) SST. As the distance to land decreases, this mean SST\ndifference increases to a maximum of about 0.72?C, indicating that the bias due to land contamination\nis on the order of 0.6?C. From Fig. 9.7, it is clear that this bias applies only for SST retrievals\n100e150 km from land. It should be noted that these results are specific to the 10.7 GHz channel\nof TMI.\n\nTable 9.3 Nighttime SatelliteeMoored Buoy SSTErrors, Bias, and StandardDeviation (STD) in ?C\nTOGATAO Buoys PIRATA Buoys\n\nSatellite Colocations Bias STD Colocations Bias STD\n\nTMI 84,702 ?0.09 0.67 1169 ?0.09 0.60\nAMSR-E 21,461 ?0.03 0.41 2837 ?0.00 0.35\n\n650 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nAnother source of errors in microwave radiometry is radio frequency interference (RFI), which is\nthe fastest growing source of error in microwave sensing of SST (and wind speed). The RFI impact on\nwater vapor, cloud liquid water is less, but is growing as are the sources of RFI. These sources can\ngenerally be traced to media broadcasting activities (including television and radio) from commercial\nsatellites in geostationary orbit. Signals from these geostationary satellites reflect off of the Earth\u2019s\nsurface into the microwave radiometer\u2019s FOV. Other ground-based RFI comes from radio and cell\nphone transmission activities. Some of these sources have been identified and cataloged. Many change\nwith time, and new sources appear all the time.\n\nIt is easy to identify and correct a microwave signal affected by very large RFI, but it is a lot harder\nto correct microwave signals affected by lower level RFI. The timeespace changes in RFI must be\ncarefully monitored so as to avoid their influence on measurements that will be used to infer climate\nchange in the Earth-atmosphere system. The increasing encroachment on microwave radiometry\nfrequency bands by people wanting to use these parts of the spectrum for their communication needs\nindicates that RFI will be increasing in activity and intensity in the future.\n\nThe RFI resulting from geostationary broadcast sources depends on broadcast frequency, power\nand direction, microwave radiometers\u2019 bandwidths, signal glint angle, and ocean surface roughness.\nUnfortunately, to improve the radiometric sensitivity, microwave radiometers\u2019 bandwidths are typi-\ncally wider than the protected bands for microwave remote sensing meaning that these instruments can\nreceive RFI from legal sources using nearby frequency bands allocated for communications and other\ncommercial uses. Of the instruments discussed here AMSR-E and Windsat are the two most affected\nby RFI. This is due to the lower frequency bands of these two instruments. Windsat receives more RFI\nthan AMSR-E due to wider measurement bandwidths. Wider bandwidths result in more signal by\nreducing noise but it also opens the bandwidth to RFI. For example, Windsat\u2019s 18.7 GHz channel\n\nFIGURE 9.7\n\nLand contamination bias derived from TMIdVIRS SST comparisons. This global average shows that by\n\nremoving data within 100e150 km of land, side lobe contamination will be removed.\n\n9.1 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE 651\n\n\n\nreceives a lot of RFI from direct TV\u2019s nationwide broadcast beams, while AMSR-E with a narrower\n18.7 GHz channel is not significantly influenced by this RFI source.\n\nTo serve smaller, but geographically dispersed markets media satellites also broadcast wide, low-\npower beams to cover such large and less populated regions. These lower-power signals also cause RFI\nand they can be a lot more difficult to detect and correct for. In addition, the RFI depends heavily on\nhow closely the satellite reflection points at the RFI source. This is called the glint angle in analogy to\nsunglints and optical remote sensing, where the direct reflection of the strong solar signal overwhelms\nthe ocean surface signal.\n\nRuf et al. (2006) introduced a new type of microwave radiometer detector that is capable of\nidentifying both high and low levels of RFI and of reducing or eliminating the effects of this RFI on\nradiometer BTs. High-level, localized RFI can be easily identified by its abnormal appearance in BTs.\nLow-level or persistent RFI is much more difficult to identify and filter out. Their agile digital detector\n(ADD) is able to discriminate between RFI and natural thermal emission signals by directly measuring\nhigher-order moments of the signal, than just the variance that is usually measured. The ADD then uses\nspectral filtering methods to selectively remove RFI. ADD performance has been verified in controlled\nlaboratory tests and in the field near a commercial air traffic control radar. A detailed description of the\ndifferent RFI detection and mitigation techniques is provided in Section 4.6.3.4 of this book.\n\n9.1.5 MERGING INFRARED AND PASSIVE MICROWAVE SEA SURFACE\nTEMPERATURES\n\nAs discussed in previous sections, IR and microwave SST capabilities are complimentary. While the\nIR sensors have higher spatial resolutions, they are subject to obscuration by clouds and attenuation\ndue to atmospheric water vapor. Sensing of SST using microwave radiometry passes through clouds\nand is not affected by atmospheric moisture. It is affected by the presence of water droplets in heavy\nrain and by high winds. The microwave radiometry SSTs also suffer from a poor spatial resolution. It is\ntherefore very attractive to figure out how to combine these two different SST sensing mechanisms,\ninto a single SST field that takes best advantage of each of the individual sensors.\n\nIn a study that combines AVHRR and TMI SST estimates, Wick et al. (2004) designed an SST\nproduct that merged these two different sensing systems using an optimal interpolation scheme. They\nalso address the complex spatial and temporal differences in these two SST products that result from the\nvery different error sources and differences in measurement characteristics. They use existing IR and\nmicrowave radiometry SST products to generate their blended product rather than go back to the original\nradiances to generate the blend. The IR product is the operational AVHRR NLSST product from the US\nNaval Oceanographic Office (NAVO) (May et al., 1998), and the microwave radiometry SST is the TMI\nSST produced by remote sensing systems (Wentz et al., 2000). The IR is available as orbital files with an\napproximately 8 km resolution while the TMI SSTs are provided as daily ascending and descending\ngrids at 0.25 degree resolution. To blend these two products each was mapped onto day and night grids at\na 0.25 degree resolution.\n\nThe blending process of combining the two different SST products has several different compo-\nnents. First is to identify and account from retrieval errors in each of the products. Second is to\ncompensate for different measurement times and effective sampling depths (IR radiances are emitted\nfrom the 10-mm-thin skin of the ocean while the microwave emissions represent the upper 1 mm of the\nocean). The third step is to blend the SSTs together into a common product.\n\n652 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nCombining SST products from two different types of retrievals requires the assumption that the\nSST products represent the same quantity or that there is some method to account for differences in\nthe products. Differences between three monthly composites of these two different SST products\nreveal some complex spaceetime differences (Fig. 9.8). From these differences, it is clear that the two\ndifferent SSTs cannot be simply combined without any consideration given to these spaceetime\ndifferences. The differences result from both retrieval errors and from different geophysical processes.\nTo first explore the retrieval uncertainties, SST estimates from both products were compared to\ncoincident observations from moored and drifting buoys and the differences evaluated as functions of\nthe environmental parameters that affect retrieval accuracy (Castro et al., 2004).\n\nThis latter study concluded that bias adjustments are needed to reconcile microwave and IR\nSSTs to coincident buoy SST observations. Further improvements are possible by including other\ncorrections based on climatological SST anomaly and aerosol optical depth. These additional\ncorrections reduce the monthly RMS differences by as much as 42% and reduce the difference with the\nindependent reference buoys by as much as 10%. The largest individual corrections are to the IR data\nin regions of low SST, but the microwave corrections are more geographically distributed and they are\nlarger in number.\n\nFIGURE 9.8\n\nDifference in maps for the TRMM microwave imager (TMI) and advanced very high resolution radiometer\n\n(AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) products for night and day composites for JuneeAugust 2000.\n\n9.1 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE 653\n\n\n\nFor their blending efforts, Wick et al. (2004) used these results to formulate bias adjustments for the\nTMI SSTs as functions of wind speed, SST, water vapor, and atmospheric stability. For the AVHRR,\nbias corrections were computed for aerosol content, water vapor, and SST. It is important to note that\ncoincident measures of wind speed and water vapor are provided with the TMI data stream, while the\naerosol content is obtained from the NOAA/NESDIS AVHRR operational product (Husar et al., 1997),\nand air temperature is estimated from a climatology developed at Oregon State University (Esbensen\nand Kushnir, 1981). Four separate bias adjustments are computed and applied to the appropriate SST\nproduct as specified in Castro et al. (2004).\n\nAdditional compensation must be applied to each SST retrieval to account for geophysical\nprocesses, which also contribute to the differences seen in Fig. 9.8. One major contributor is the role of\ndiurnal warming that results in complex temperature gradients just beneath the ocean\u2019s surface. As\nstated earlier the IR SST are in response to emissions from the 10-mm-thin skin of the ocean while the\nmicrowave emissions extend down to a 1-mm-thick ocean layer. Diurnal warming can create a vertical\ntemperature gradient even in this very small vertical range. To compensate for this effect, the SST\nretrievals were referenced to the same predawn time, while the diurnal warming estimates were\ncomputed as functions of wind speed and daily mean solar insolation using the model of Fairall et al.\n(1996). The model was run for expected ranges of wind speed and insolation to generate a diurnal\nsignal due only to this diurnal warming. Curves were fitted to the results to formulate a simple lookup\ntable to apply these corrections to subsequent measurements. No further correction was made for the\npresence of a skin layer in their study (Wick et al., 2004). Both SST products include as a reference to\nbuoys in their derivation and the bias adjustments discussed earlier were all made relative to buoy\nmeasurements. Thus, both SST products were effectively referenced to a subsurface temperature near\n1 m depth.\n\nOnce the bias adjustments were made and the sample times were adjusted, the two different SST\nproducts could be merged. Two different methods were explored for this blending step. The first is a\nsimple merge with no additional effort to fill in the gaps in either of the original fields. The second is\nthe production of a final full SST field using an optimum interpolation scheme. This was done\nsequentially as the simply merged product is a good interim step that depends directly on the data and\nis needed as the input data field for the optimum interpolation.\n\nThe merged SST product is computed as the simple average of the SST products on the\n0.25 degree grid wherever values are available. If a grid cell contains an SST retrieval from only\none sensor at a time, the merged product takes the SST value of that sensor for that location and time.\nIn the averaging, all of the SSTs are given the same weights. No additional attempt is made to\nincorporate any additional information on the uncertainty of a particular product. The optimum\ninterpolation method of Reynolds and Smith (1994) was used to map the merged SST product and\nfill in all of the gaps.\n\nThe primary input to this analysis step was the 0.25 degree grid merged SST. The resulting\ndaily mapped grids were computed by updating a first-guess SSTwith these daily products. The first-\nguess SST field was taken from a weekly averaged merged SST data product that was linearly\ninterpolated to determine the daily-average SST field. Using this weekly averaged first guess helped\nto eliminate numerical instabilities in the optimal interpolation method and to fill regions void of\ndata in the daily maps. Data increments were defined as the difference between the input data and\nthe first guess and were weighted using a Gaussian distance. They were then added to the first guess\nto give the updated daily SST analysis. Both types of satellite SSTs were assumed to have equivalent\n\n654 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\namounts of correlated and uncorrelated error. The error for each input data set was defined as the\nratio of the data to the first-guess error. The error ratio for the MCSST was set to unity, while the\nTMI error ratio had a minimum error ratio of 1.67 and this ratio was allowed to vary as a function of\nwind speed due to greater SST retrieval uncertainty under low (<3 m/s) and high (>10 m/s) wind\nspeeds. As a result, the resulting error structure more heavily weights the MCSST data due to their\ngreater overall accuracy. While buoy SST references were used to determine the individual SST bias\ncorrections, no buoy data were used in this SST mapping analysis.\n\nUsing this process, Wick et al. (2004) created daily merged AVHRR \u00fe TMI SST fields as shown\nfor example in the upper panel of Fig. 9.9 for August 10, 2000. While the coverage is better than for\neither AVHRR or TMI alone, there are still gaps in the coverage. These gaps are the consequence of a\nlack of satellite sampling or the inability to retrieve SST due to cloud cover or precipitation. The SST\nfield itself is in general smooth and the SST values are consistent in regions where data from the\nAVHRR and TMI are known to overlap.\n\nFIGURE 9.9\n\nSample merged sea surface temperature (SST) product (top panel) and differences between the merged SST\n\nproduct (lower panel) with and without the bias adjustments and diurnal corrections.\n\n9.1 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE 655\n\n\n\nThe lower panel in Fig. 9.9 shows the impact of the inclusion of the bias corrections and diurnal\nwarming compensation as it is the difference between the merged SST product with and without these\nadjustments. It is evident that these adjustments have a significant impact, and corrections can be as\nlarge as 1e2?C. There are clear patterns to these corrections, which are similar to the SST difference\npatterns presented in Fig. 9.8 with some important differences. A region of positive difference is\nlocated to the west of central Africa where Saharan dust is known to blow out over the Atlantic Ocean\nstrongly influencing the IR sensing of SST. Another large positive difference is also apparent over the\nArabian Sea where the aerosol content is also very high.\n\nThese differences are such that the merged SST product is warmer as a result of compensating for\ncooling of the AVHRR SST retrievals due to the presence of the atmospheric aerosols. Likewise,\nregions where diurnal warming conditions have been removed show up as localized strong negative\ndifferences in the Pacific Ocean just west of Central America and east of Australia. The region near the\nsouth China Sea was an area of large TMI SST adjustments.\n\nTo provide some independent validation of this merged SST, Wick et al. (2004) compared the\nmerged SST with drifting and moored buoy SSTs. Since all SSTs were referenced to predawn values,\nonly nighttime buoy observations were used in these comparisons. The results are presented here as\nTable 9.4.\n\nIn this table it can be seen how including the corrections reduces both the bias and RMS errors in\nthis merged product. Also included is a comparison with buoy SSTs the MCSST and TMI SST esti-\nmates. The accuracy of the merged SST is comparable to the accuracy of the TMI only SST product\nwhile it is only slightly poorer than the AVHRR only SST field.\n\nMost people will not work with the directly merged SST product, but would rather have a smoothly\ninterpolated field. The optimally interpolated version of Fig. 9.9 is presented here as Fig. 9.10.\n\nAll the gaps appearing in Fig. 9.9 have been filled and the result is a smooth map of SST. The\nadvantage of merging these two different types of SSTs is to be able to retrieve this type of a smooth\nSST product everywhere it was mapped.\n\nAgain to test the validity of this interpolated SST maps comparisons were carried out with moored\nand drifting buoy SSTs. The results are presented here as Table 9.5.\n\nSurprisingly the accuracy of the interpolated SST product was found to be better than the\nraw merged SST. This may be the result of a greater number of comparison samples inherent in the\ninterpolated field. By including the bias adjustments and diurnal corrections the bias in the interpolated\nproduct is reduced, but the RMS differences decrease only slightly. The best performance in terms\nof RMS variability were obtained using only nighttime data, thus eliminating the need for diurnal\ncorrections in the daytime data.\n\nTable 9.4 Merged Sea Surface Temperature Product Accuracy Summary\n\nMerged Product Bias (K) RMS (K)\n\nAll corrections ?0.08 0.59\nNo corrections \u00fe0.14 0.67\nMCSST only, all corrections ?0.02 0.58\nTMI only, all corrections ?0.10 0.61\nRMS, root mean squared.\n\n656 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nIf the diurnal corrections were not applied the RMS difference was reduced, but the bias slightly\nincreased. This indicates that the diurnal corrections are reducing the mean effects of diurnal warming,\nbut are also adding scatter in the data due to the difficulty in predicting diurnal warming at specific\ntimes because of the warming at specific times given the limited detail on the forcing data. The other\nbias adjustments had a smaller impact on the optimally mapped product than on the simply merged\nSST. This suggests that further improvements to the mapped SST product may be achieved by a better\ntreatment of diurnal warming.\n\nA similar analysis was carried out by Guan and Kawamura (2004). They again used an AVHRR\nSST together with an IR SST from the geostationary meteorological satellite stretchedevisible\ninfrared spin scan radiometer (GMS-VISSR) and the TRMM TMI microwave radiometry SSTs\ntogether with the VIRS also on the TRMM satellite. They generated daily 0.05 degree resolution\ncloud-free SST products in three areas of the Pacific Ocean: the Kuroshio region, the AsiaePacific\nregion, and the Pacific during a 1-year period from October 1999 to September 2000. Comparison of\ntheir merged SST product with in situ SSTs from buoys operated by the Japanese Meteorological\nAgency (JMA) suggests an accuracy of 0.95K for the merged SST product. Guan and Kawamura\n(2004) summarized their data sets in Table 9.6 assigning each an SSTaccuracy. These range from 0.6K\nfor the AVHRR to 0.8K for the GMS-VISSR.\n\nTable 9.5 Analyzed Product Accuracy Summary\n\nAnalyzed Product Bias (K) RMS (K)\n\nAll corrections ?0.01 0.59\nNo corrections \u00fe0.18 0.61\nNighttime data only, all corrections \u00fe0.03 0.53\nAll corrections except diurnal warming \u00fe0.05 0.56\nRMS, root mean squared.\n\nFIGURE 9.10\n\nOptimally interpolated merged sea surface temperature (SST) for August 10, 2000.\n\n9.1 SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURE 657\n\n\n\nThe AVHRR value was the RMS number given by Strong and McClain (1984), and McClain\n(1989), the GMS-VISSR around Japan from Sakaida and Kawamura (1992a,b), and the TMI RMS\nerror from Shibata et al. (1999), Wentz et al. (2000), and Kachi et al. (2001). It is to be noted that\nthe spatial resolution of the AVHRR is about 1 km, the GMS-VISSR about 5 km, and the TMI\nabout 50 km.\n\nIn this study the role of diurnal variation was acknowledged, and rather than model it SSTs\nat different times were used to estimate the diurnal change. This was greatly enabled by using\nthe frequent sampling of the GMS-VISSR SST product that in spite of its slightly worse spatial\nresolution provides frequent SST samples over a day. In addition, this study (Guan and Kawamura,\n2004) ignores the difference between skin and bulk SSTs and rectifies all measurements against\nin situ buoy SSTs.\n\nOne important thing is that this study uses an AVHRR SST produced at Tohoku\nUniversity (Sakaida et al., 2000) rather than the NAVO SST product used by Wick et al. (2004).\nAlso the GMS-VISSR data are unique to this study and come from the Sendai Research Center\n(Tanahashi et al., 2000). Finally, the TMI SST product is generated by the Earth Observation\nResearch Center of the then National Space Development Agency that included the TRMM VIRS\nprocessing. The important thing is that all of these SST sources are independent of those used in\nWick et al. (2004).\n\nThey also used objective analysis (aka optimum interpolation) to merge the different SST\nfields. They used an analytical correlation function for their length scale in this optimum\ninterpolation method. An example of the merged GMS-VISSR and TMI SST fields is shown here\nin Fig. 9.11.\n\nFor this merged product all SSTs were interpolated to a 0.05 degree grid. In their processing\nthey used a 3-day SST centered at the current day. If the time difference was equal to 2 days, they\njust selected the 5-day value within the spatial window with the added condition that all the cross-\ncorrelation values were positive. For quality control, any SST value that deviated by more than 2K\nfrom the overall mean value was rejected. If several different SST values were available for any one\ngrid point, the following priority was set for selecting the value to retain: AVHRR \u00feVIRS, TMI, and\nGMS-VISSR.\n\nTable 9.6 Specifications of the Satellite Data\n\nSatellite Sensor\nSpatial Resolution\n(Degree) Temporal Resolution Coverage\n\nAccuracy\n(K)\n\nNOAA AVHRR 0.01 Twice per day per satellite 20?N w 60?N 0.6\n120?Ew 160?E\n\nGMS S-VISSR 0.05 Hourly 20?N w 60?N 0.8\n120?Ew 160?E\n\nTRMM MI 0.25 3 days for full coverage 38?S w 38?N 0.7\n0? w 360?E\n\nTRMM VIRS 0.05 3 days for full coverage 38?S w 38?N 0.7\n0? w 360?E\n\n658 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe benefit of merging TMI SSTwith the GMS-VISSR SST can be clearly seen in Fig. 9.11, where\nthe white areas of the GMS-VISSR image were all filled in by the TMI SST in forming the merged\nSST. The primary benefit of the merged product was its ability to retain a lot of the fine structure of the\nKuroshio present in the IR data but absent in the microwave TMI SST image.\n\nThe merged SST product was compared with JMA buoys for the period October 1999 to April 2000\n(Fig. 9.12).

In Fig. 9.12 the bias is ?0.01K\nand the STD is 0.95K.\n\nThis accuracy estimate is higher than that found in Wick et al. (2004) in a very similar analysis.\nThere can be many sources of this accuracy difference. To begin with, this analysis includes a new\nSST data product not considered in the Wick et al. (2004) study. In addition, all of the AVHRR and\nTMI data were processed into SST products by completely different systems than those used by\nWick et al. (2004). In addition, the objective mapping scheme is a bit different which would also\ncontribute to this difference in accuracy. Finally, a very different suite of buoys was used for\ncomparisons and these may have been processed in a very different manner than those used in the\nWick et al. (2004) study. The fact that the Guan and Kawamura (2004) study was restricted primarily\nto the western Pacific may have also influenced this error difference since the Wick et al. (2004)\nstudy addressed the global ocean.\n\nBoth studies, however, are encouraging in that they discuss methods of putting together very\ndisparate SST products to take best advantage of the beneficial characteristics of each. Only in this way\nwill it be possible to produce a regular and global SST product for related studies of airesea interaction\nand global climate change.\n\n9.2 SEA SURFACE HEIGHT AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY\nSatellite altimetry has resulted in a real change in the way physical oceanographers regard the task of\nmapping surface geostrophic currents. Once limited to ship-based hydrographic surveys physical\noceanographers were now presented with satellite-based sea surface height (SSH) measurements that\ncould estimate the sea surface and its variations in time and space. The ocean\u2019s surface is much like\nan atmospheric pressure map is to a meteorologist in that the geostrophic winds can be inferred from\nthe spatial distribution of atmospheric pressure and changes in this pressure distribution reflect\nspaceetime changes in the winds. Similarly, the ocean\u2019s surface and its variability reflect the ocean\u2019s\ngeostrophic surface currents. While this is not the complete picture of surface currents, it goes a very\nlong way to providing a unique means of viewing surface currents and their variability in a way that\nwas previously not possible.\n\n9.2.1 RADAR ALTIMETERS\nA large class of real-aperture radars is radar altimeters (RAs). Designed initially to provide an accurate\nmeasurement of the surface topography of the ocean, the RA has evolved into an instrument for\nstudying not only ocean phenomena (including sea ice), but also terrestrial hydrology conditions. A\ngreat deal has been learned about the ocean since the late 1980s when a navy altimeter satellite called\nGeosat was moved from its classified geodetic orbit into a 10-day exact repeat mission (ERM)\nfollowing the same orbit as the earlier and short-lived SeaSat altimeter. Most significant during this\nperiod was the Topex/Poseidon (T/P) satellites launched in late 1992 and operating for a full 13 years\nand overlapping with its replacement Jason-1. The real pinnacle of satellite altimeter coverage was in\nthe late 1990s and early 2000s when multiple altimeter satellites operated by different countries and\nagencies provided dramatically improved coverage.\n\n660 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n9.2.2 HISTORY OF SATELLITE ALTIMETERS\nAs is clearly described in Fig. 9.13, spaceborne RAs got their start with the Skylab and Geos-3\nmissions in the mid-1970s. These instruments were strictly exploratory and did not yield useful\ntime-series measurements. The first real operational satellite altimeter was part of the short-lived\nSeaSat mission in 1979. This instrument demonstrated the value of sea-level measurements made\nfrom such a RA. Still there was a gap of more than a decade before a new mission dedicated to\naltimeter measurements was flown.\n\nAs it is apparent from Fig. 9.13, there was another satellite altimeter in the mid-1980s, but it was\nnot originally designed as a monitoring mission for ocean variability. Geosat was initially conceived as\na mission to measure the Earth\u2019s geoid for the US navy operations, which was a classified mission with\nthe data unavailable to the general science community. After the 1-year classified \u201cgeodetic\u201d mission\nwas completed, the navy was convinced by some ocean scientists to put Geosat in the exact repeat orbit\nflown previously by SeaSat and allowed to operate as an altimeter to measure ocean surface variability.\nThisERM phase of the Geosat program provided useful data for many research projects and set the\nstage for the future dedicated missions such as T/P.\n\nThe T/P satellite altimeter was the first satellite dedicated to observing the ocean surface variability\nand using these observations to study surface currents, waves, and tides. This satellite operated for a\ntotal of 13 years providing increasingly accurate measurements of the ocean\u2019s surface as the altimetry\nscience community learned how to process these data and make the various corrections needed to\nmake the results more accurate. In 1991, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched its first RA on\nERS-1, which was followed in 1995 by ERS-2. T/P managed to continue operating into the lifetime of\nits follow-on Jason-1 satellite where for 6 months the two satellites were operated in the same orbit\n90 s apart. This intercalibration period revealed that the new Jason-1 SSHs were biased high relative to\nT/P and the in situ measurements made at the Harvest Platform off southern California of\n\nFIGURE 9.13\n\nHistory of spaceborne radar altimeters (Le Traon, 2007).\n\n9.2 SEA SURFACE HEIGHT AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY 661\n\n\n\n138 ? 18 mm (Haines et al., 2003). Thus, while the altimeter variations are very similar, there is an\noffset in the Jason-1 heights relative to the T/P observations.\n\nThe launch of ERS-2 was followed shortly by another US Navy mission known as Geosat follow-\non (GFO). This started a decade when multiple satellite altimeters provided the best coverage possible\nfor these instruments. The launch of Europe\u2019s large ENVISAT satellite in 2002 continued the series\nstarted with ERS-1, 2. Thus, the best observing period for satellite altimetry was between 1999 and\nearly 2012. In mid-2012, Jason-1 was found to have a limited lifetime and it was decided to move this\nsatellite from its exact repeat orbit to a geodetic orbit thus compromising the ocean variability\nmonitoring aspects of this particular altimeter. A short time later ENVISAT suddenly ceased to\ncommunicate with the ground bringing this amazing mission to an abrupt close. Also in 2011 the US\nNavy canceled any plans to replace the GFO satellite, which ceased to operate November 28, 2008. As\na result, in mid-2012 there were only the two Jason satellite altimeters operating with one of them in a\ngeodetic orbit.\n\n9.2.3 PRINCIPLE OF OPERATION\nAs is clearly depicted in Fig. 9.14 the satellite RA measures the range between it and the sea surface\nrelative to a reference ellipsoid from which the satellite orbit is well known. The quantity of prime\ninterest to the physical oceanographer is the sea level relative to the marine geoid, which then indicates\nthe ocean currents. The sea surface topography measured by a satellite altimeter can be written as:\n\nSSH\u00f0x; t\u00de \u00bc G\u00f0x\u00de \u00fe h\u00f0x; t\u00de \u00fe ?\u00f0x; t\u00de; (9.4)\nwhere G is the geoid, h is the dynamic topography, and ? are measurement errors (Le Traon,\n2007). At present, the marine geoid is not well enough known to estimate globally the absolute\ndynamic height except at very long wavelengths. However, the interesting variable part of the\n\nFIGURE 9.14\n\nSatellite altimeter measurement principle.\n\nCredits CNES and mention of Aviso\u00fe website https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/my-aviso.html.\n\n662 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\nhttps://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/my-aviso.html\n\n\ndynamic topography SSH\n0 \u00f0x; t\u00de is easily calculated using the \u201crepeat-track method.\u201d For a given\n\nsatellite track (recall that the altimeter is a nadir sampling instrument) SSH0 (x, t) is obtained by\nremoving the mean profile over several altimeter cycles which contain both the geoid G and the mean\ndynamic topography. Thus,\n\nSSH0\u00f0x; t\u00de \u00bc SSH\u00f0x; t\u00de ? hSSH\u00f0x\u00deit \u00bc h\u00f0x; t\u00de ? hh\u00f0x\u00deit \u00fe ?\n0 \u00f0x; t\u00de; (9.5)\n\nTo get the absolute SSH, one needs to use a mean dynamic height climatology from historical\nin situ data or to use existing geoid estimates together with an altimeter mean sea surface. One can also\nrely on a model average. Gravimetric missions such as CHAMP (Challenging Minisatellite Payload)\nand Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) have provided improved geoid estimates.\nLaunched in March of 2009 the ESA\u2019s gravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer\n(GOCE) is now delivering unprecedented resolution of the geoid with an accuracy of 1e2 cm verti-\ncally over a 100 km spatial resolution (Fig. 9.15).\n\nThe GOCE geoid can be used with an altimetric mean sea surface to derive hSSH\u00f0x\u00deit that can then\nbe added to SSH\n\n0 \u00f0x; t\u00de to give the ocean surface elevation. This SSH is thus composed of the geoid, the\ndynamic topography and noise. Of these, the geoid variability contributes about 100 m, while the\ndynamic topography variations are about 2 m. Added to this uncertainty is the variability due to ocean\ntides (1e20 m) and other correction terms.\n\nFIGURE 9.15\n\nGravity field and steady-state ocean circulation explorer model geoid with variations from ?110 to \u00fe88 m\n(http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/typo3temp/pics/Geoid_01_0eff7212c9.png).\n\n9.2 SEA SURFACE HEIGHT AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY 663\n\nhttp://www.gfz-potsdam.de/typo3temp/pics/Geoid_01_0eff7212c9.png\n\n\n9.2.4 ALTIMETER ERROR CORRECTIONS\nThese other corrections are comprised of instrumental corrections, a sea state bias correction, an\nionospheric correction, wet and dry tropospheric corrections, tidal corrections, and inverse barometer\ncorrections. Added to these, there are errors in the orbit. Instrument errors are oscillator drift, Doppler\nshift, tracker response, pointing angle variability, and internal calibration.\n\nOrbit error is a consequence of less than perfect knowledge of the spacecraft\u2019s altitude. It is actually\nthe largest of the altimeter errors, but thanks to excellent tracking information and good orbital models,\nit has been possible to reduce this orbit error to?2 cm. This is small compared to the?10 cm accuracy\nassociated with the ERS-1, 2 satellites. Instrumental in this success was the addition of GPS\nmonitoring to the T/P satellite, which became a standard for future altimeter missions. In addition, the\nDORIS Doppler radio tracking system was added by CNES, which added a great many ground stations\nto the tracking of T/P and future altimeter satellites. Finally, a network of ground-based lasers was used\nwith onboard laser retroreflectors to track the altimeter satellites. It is important to recognize that orbit\nerror has a very long wavelength characteristic.\n\nSpace/time variations in atmospheric pressure result in changes in sea level on the order of a\ncentimeter/millibar change in atmospheric pressure. In addition, wind and pressure forcing creates\na higher-frequency barotropic response at period less than 20 days (Le Traon, 2007). Tidal variations\ncan result in SSH changes between 10 and 60 cm in the open ocean, which can be larger in the coastal\nocean where the tides become highly nonlinear.\n\nIonospheric changes can introduce range errors from 1 to 20 cm, but the dual-frequency altimeters\n(this range delay error depends on frequency) can correct this down to 0.5 cm. One of the largest\ncorrections is for atmospheric path delay due to atmospheric water vapor. For this reason, most of the\nradiometers carry a bore-sighted microwave radiometer optimized to measure the water vapor induced\npath delay (Brown et al., 2004, 2009). Called the wet delay, this correction varies both spatially and\ntemporally with magnitudes from 5 to 30 cm (highest in the tropical convergence zones where at-\nmospheric convection is strong). The precision of the onboard water vapor correction is about 1 cm.\nWhen the microwave radiometer data are missing the water vapor content is calculated from atmo-\nspheric climate models.\n\nOne of the most difficult errors to compensate for, it is known as the sea state bias and it is due to\nthe fact that the concave form of the altimeter wave fronts respond differently to the wave covered\nsea surface where wave troughs better reflect the altimeter signal, as compared to the wave crests.\nThis shifts the SSH away from the mean sea surface to a bias that favors the troughs (Le Traon et al.,\n2010). The SSH error for the presently operating altimeter frequencies can be as large as 2 cm.\nThe temporal evolution of these errors up to the T/P mission is summarized here in Fig. 9.16\n(Le Traon, 2007).\n\n9.2.5 ALTIMETER WAVEFORMS AND BACKSCATTER\nNear the coast, altimeter data become less useful. First the microwave radiometer has inherently\nlarge spot sizes, which are compromised when they encounter land eliminating the water vapor path\nlength correction. In addition, the altimeter waveform is altered by the presence of land in the\naltimeter footprint. Here it is important to point out how the SSH and other parameters are retrieved\nfrom the altimeter waveform. The waveform (Fig. 9.17) indicates the SSH from the midpoint of the\nleading edge at least for the open ocean retrieval (Brown, 1977).

During this time, it became advisable to merge\nthese different altimeter data together to improve the spaceetime coverage of the combined\naltimeter data. To merge multisatellite altimeter data one must first create homogeneous and\nintercalibrated data sets. A method to achieve this is to use the most precise mission as a reference for\nthe other satellites (Le Traon and Ogor, 1998). During this period the best references were T/P or\nJason 1, 2. Further to compute the SLA, it is best to use a common reference surface to get the SLA\nrelative to the same ocean mean.\n\n9.2.7 SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR ALTIMETRY\nOne method of increasing the spatial resolution of an altimeter is to operate in a delay-Doppler\nmode (Raney, 1998). This has become known as SAR altimetry by analogy since the improved\n\nFIGURE 9.19\n\nSample real altimeter waveforms over (A) the ocean, (B) the Amazon river, and (C) land (Sahara desert).\n\nAdapted from https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/techniques/altimetry/principle/pulses-and-waveforms.html.\n\n9.2 SEA SURFACE HEIGHT AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY 667\n\nhttps://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/techniques/altimetry/principle/pulses-and-waveforms.html\n\n\nresolution is due to multilooks of the same target. The key innovation in the delay-Doppler RA is delay\ncompensation, analogous to range curvature correction in a burst-mode SAR. The height estimates are\nsorted by Doppler frequency and integrated in parallel (Fig. 9.20).\n\nThere are more looks accumulated than in a conventional altimeter and the relatively small along-\ntrack resolution is constant at about 250 m for a Ku-band altimeter. This type of altimeter is more\nefficient in response to the radar pulses and hence this new approach is more efficient than that for a\nconventional altimeter. Thus, this approach leads to a smaller altimeter that requires less power to\nachieve the same level of response.\n\nThe first satellite to carry one of these altimeters is the ESA\u2019s Cryosat-2 mission (http://www.esa.\nint/esaLP/ESAMNM1VMOC_LPcryosat_0.html). Unlike conventional altimeters where the interval\nbetween pulses is about 500 ms, the Cryosat-2 altimeters sends out a burst of pulses with an interval of\nonly 50 ms between them. The returning echoes are correlated (SAR-like) and examining them in burst\nmode, the echoes are separated into strips arranged across the track by exploiting the frequency shifts\ncaused by the Doppler effect in the forward and afterward looking parts of the beam. Each strip is\nabout 250 m wide and the interval between bursts is arranged so that the satellite moves forward by\n250 m each time step. The strips laid down by successive bursts can therefore be super-imposed on\neach other and averaged to reduce noise. This mode of operation is called the SAR mode. The primary\ngoal of this mission is to evaluate the ice-sheet elevation and estimate the freeboard of sea-ice.\n\n9.2.8 ALTIMETRY APPLICATIONS\n9.2.8.1 Mapping Geostrophic Ocean Surface Currents\nGeostrophic currents are by definition a balance between the Coriolis force and the horizontal pressure\ngradient. This pressure gradient at the sea surface is expressed by the slope of the sea surface with the\n\nAL\nON\n\nG T\nRA\n\nCK\n\nAL\nON\n\nG T\nRA\n\nCK\n\nAz\nim\n\nuth\n\nres\nolu\n\ntio\nn\n\nAz\nim\n\nuth\n\nres\nolu\n\ntio\nn\n\nImprovement of azimuth\nresolution\n\n(Cryosat-2, SRAL/S3)\n\nFIGURE 9.20\n\nSynthetic aperture radar altimeter data collection.\n\n668 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\nhttp://www.esa.int/esaLP/ESAMNM1VMOC_LPcryosat_0.html\nhttp://www.esa.int/esaLP/ESAMNM1VMOC_LPcryosat_0.html\n\n\nstrength of the geostrophic currents being proportional to the strength of the surface gradient of this\nelevation. This balance can be written as:\n\nvs \u00bc \u00feg\nf\n$\nvz\n\nvx\n; (9.6a)\n\nus \u00bc ?g\nf\n$\nvz\n\nvy\n. (9.6b)\n\nwhere the sea surface is given by z(x, y), g is the acceleration of gravity, f is the Coriolis parameter\n(which represents the Coriolis force and changes with latitude), and x and y are the horizontal\ncoordinates. Look at the x dimension only this situation (Fig. 9.21) can be depicted as in Eq. (9.6a).\n\nThe geostrophic surface current resulting from this sea surface slope is into the paper (in the\nnorthern hemisphere and due to a reversal in the sign of the Coriolis force it would be out of the paper\nin the southern hemisphere) as indicated by the cross-labeled by vs and the strength of this surface\ngeostrophic current is proportional to the gradient of the surface elevation relative to the geoid. A\nsurface current of 10 cm/s corresponds to a horizontal elevation change of 10 cm over a 100 km. This\nalmost imperceptible sea level change is responsible for this typical ocean current velocity. Strong\ncurrents such as the Gulf Stream and Antarctic Circumpolar Currents (ACCs) can have sea level\nchanges as large as 20 cm over 100 km.\n\nThe geoid is by definition a level surface and therefore a level of constant geopotential (no work can\nbe done in the vertical direction). Sea surface topography is caused by processes that cause horizontal\nmotion in the ocean that will be in balance with the excursions of the sea surface. Such processes\ninclude tides, ocean currents, and changes in barometric pressure. Surface topographic variations due\nto ocean currents are considered as \u201cdynamical changes\u201d and are therefore called \u201cdynamic topog-\nraphy.\u201d This dynamic topography is roughly one-hundredth of the geoid undulations. Thus, the shape\nof the sea surface is dominated by local variations of gravity.\n\nThe influence of ocean currents on the sea surface is much smaller. Typically, sea-surface\ntopography has an amplitude of ?1 m with typical slopes of vg/vxw 1e10 mrad for\nv \u00bc 0.1e1.0 m/s at midlatitudes. The height of the geoid, smoothed over horizontal distances greater\nthan about 400 km, is known with an accuracy of ?1 mm from data collected as part of the NASA\nGRACE satellite mission.\n\nBecause the geoid was not well known locally before 2004, satellite altimeters were flown in orbits\nthat exactly repeat their ground tracks. This made it possible to subtract out one repeat track from an\nearlier one, thus computing the altimetric sea surface anomaly without accurate knowledge of the\ngeoid. Eventually, a long-term mean altimetric height was used along this repeat ground track to\n\nSea Surface\n\nGeoid 100 km\n\n1 mVs\n\nX\n\nz = ?\n\nS? = + \u2014 \u2022 \u2014\ng\nf\n\n??\n?x\n\nFIGURE 9.21\n\nThe sea surface associated with the geostrophic surface current.\n\n9.2 SEA SURFACE HEIGHT AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY 669\n\n\n\nestimate the SSH anomalies. T/P (1992e2005) was the first satellite designed to make the accurate\nSSH measurements needed to observe the sea surface topography and the associated geostrophic\ncurrents. It was followed by Jason-1 launched in 2001, and by Jason-2 launched in 2008. This series of\nsatellites was instrumental in ushering in the era of altimetric mapping of mesoscale ocean currents\nwith scales between 20 and 500 km.\n\nIt was also used to map the long-term mean average surface topography relative to some earlier geoid\nestimates. An example is presented here in Fig. 9.22, which is a global distribution of time-averaged\ntopography of the ocean from T/P altimeter data relative to the JGM-3 geoid model from 10/3/92 to\n10/6/99 relative to the CSR98 from the Center for Space Research of the University of Texas.\n\nGeostrophic currents in Fig. 9.22 are parallel to the contours with higher sea levels to the right in\nthe northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern. It can clearly be seen the parallel contours of\nthe ACC and the gradients that mark the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic, and the Kuroshio in the\nwestern North Pacific.\n\n9.2.8.2 Mapping Mesoscale Ocean Dynamics With Satellite Altimetry\nObserving mesoscale ocean dynamics with satellite altimetry is reviewed by Morrow and\nLe Traon (2012) using an 18-year record of satellite altimetric measurements. They state that \u201cthis\nglobal, high-resolution data set has allowed oceanographers to quantify the previously unknown\nseasonal and interannual variations in eddy kinetic energy and eddy heat and salt transports and\ninvestigate their causes.\u201d Most of these variations are in the form of mesoscale eddies that can be\ntracked using satellite altimetry eddy tracking methods to monitor their propagation pathways and to\nexplore the role of Rossby waves versus nonlinear eddy dynamics in the mid-to-high latitude bands of\nthe ocean. Satellite altimetry also makes it possible to explore how these mesoscale eddies impact the\natmospheric circulation and hence the Earth\u2019s climate.\n\nThe ocean is a turbulent system and is composed of a wide variety of mesoscale and finer circulations\nthat make up the space/time variability of the ocean\u2019s circulation. The geostrophic portion of the\nmesoscale variability can be mapped with satellite altimetry. This mesoscale variability generally refers\nto spatial scales of 50e500 km and time scales of 10e100 days. The energy of this mesoscale variability\n\nFIGURE 9.22\n\nGlobal distribution of time-averaged topography of the sea surface from T/P altimeter data between 10/3/92\n\nand 10/6/99 relative to the JGM-3 geoid.\n\n670 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\ngenerally exceeds that of the mean flow by an order of magnitude or more. These eddies are primarily\ngenerated by instabilities of the mean flow (Stammer and Wunsch, 1999), but fluctuating ocean winds\ncan also provide a direct forcing mechanism (Frankignoul and Mu?ller, 1979). In addition to being\nformed as instabilities of the mean flow eddies feed energy back into the mean flow and drive the deep\nocean circulation (Morrow et al., 1994; Lozier, 1997). They also transport heat, salt, carbon, and nu-\ntrients as they propagate in the ocean and are the principal mechanism for the poleward transport of heat\nacross strong zonal currents such as the ACC (Karsten and Marshall, 2002; Jayne and Marotzke, 2002).\n\nSatellite altimetry has made it possible over the past couple of decades to map these mesoscale sea\nlevels and associated geostrophic ocean circulation variations. Early altimeter missions such as SeaSat\n(1978) and GEOSAT (1986e89) provided the first global coverage of the ocean\u2019s mesoscale sea level\nvariations. This was the first time that mesoscale circulations and their spatial variations could be\nstudied relative to turbulence theory (Le Traon, 1991). A review of early mesoscale studies with\nsatellite altimetry is given by Le Traon and Morrow (2001a) and by Fu et al. (2010).\n\n9.2.8.2.1 Multimission Mapping Capabilities\nOne thing that has made this altimetric mapping of mesoscale circulation possible is the period of\noverlapping satellite altimeter missions that has made it possible to retrieve SSH from many different\nsatellites all at the same time. During the first decade of this century there were at least three different\naltimeters operating that could be used together. An example is shown in Fig. 9.23 from Morrow and\nLe Traon (2012) for the NW Mediterranean Sea in January 2005.\n\nFIGURE 9.23\n\n35-day coverage of altimeter missions in the NW Mediterranean Sea in January 2005. Topex-Poseidon (light\n\nred), Jason (dark red), ENVISAT (green), Geosat Follow-On (blue).\n\n9.2 SEA SURFACE HEIGHT AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY 671\n\n\n\nWhile these tracks overlap, merging the data together is not simple in that each satellite system has\ndifferent errors and orbit constraints the effects of which need to be considered when merging the\ndifferent altimeter data together. Still, the potential for increased spatial coverage is too great to ignore\nthe opportunity to merge these different altimeter data sets. Dibarboure et al. (2011) discuss an\ninterpolation technique used by the SSALTO/DUACS project to construct global gridded data sets\nfrom multimission altimeter data. In this merging a crossover analysis is used to minimize the errors\nbetween ground tracks, including a correction for the large-scale orbit errors. All of the available\naltimetric data are then mapped onto a regular 1/3 degree Mercator grid every 7e10 days, which\nmakes it possible to properly map the mesoscale dynamics.\n\nA summary of the mapping capabilities of the T/P, Jason-1, and ENVISAT combination is\npresented in Le Traon and Dibarboure (2002) using simulations from the eddy-resolving 1/10 degree\nLos Alamos Model (Smith et al., 2000). The modeled 1/10 degree sea level anomalies (SLAs) were\nadded to random noise and subsampled along altimeter tracks. The aforementioned SSALTO/DUACS\nsuboptimal interpolation technique was then applied to these subsampled data to reconstruct the 2D\nSLA. This reconstructed field was then compared with the full-resolution model SLA field. The\ndifference in SLA is an estimate of the sea level mapping error inherent in altimeter sampling. In this\nstudy they found that with two altimeters in the T/P-ERS configuration, sea level can be mapped with\nan error less than 10% of the signal variance (depending on latitude) as shown here in Fig. 9.24. Part of\nthe mapping error is due to high-frequency, high-wave number signals that are not properly resolved\nby even this combined altimeter sampling.\n\n70N\n\n60N\n\n50N\n\n40N\n\n30N\n\n20N\n\n10N\n\n0\n\n10S\n\n280\n20S\n\n299 318\nLongitude\n\nLa\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\n70N\n\n60N\n\n50N\n\n40N\n\n30N\n\n20N\n\n10N\n\n0\n\n10S\n\n20S\n\nLa\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500\n\n337 356 15 280 299 318\nLongitude\n\n337 356 15\n\ncm2/s2\n\nFIGURE 9.24\n\nComparison of eddy kinetic energy levels in the North Atlantic calculated frommodel sea level data subsampled\n\nalong T/P \u00fe ERS ground tracks (left) and from the full 1/10 degrees resolution numerical model (right).\n\n672 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nAnother major contribution to being able to resolve the space and time scales of the mesoscale\nocean circulation was the tandem mission first started when the aging T/P satellite was placed in an\norbit halfway between the Jason-1 repeat ground-tracks (which continued the previous T/P ground-\ntracks). The tandem mission had as objectives to provide a greater spatial resolution of surface\ntopography for mesoscale ocean circulation studies and for coastal tidal models. By comparing\nresults from the tandemmission with independent ERS-2 data, Le Traon and Dibarboure (2004) were\nable to show that in regions with strong mesoscale variability, the sea level and geostrophic velocity\ncan be mapped, respectively, with a height error of about 6% and velocity error of 20%e30% of the\nsignal variance. Stammer and Theiss (2004) calculated along-track geostrophic velocities from the\ntandem mission and compared them with in situ velocities measure from acoustic Doppler (ADCP)\ncurrent profiles along a ground-track near Bermuda. It was found that the tandem mission\ngeostrophic velocity variances to be about 25% lower than the current variance observed by the\nADCP, which contained both geostrophic and ageostrophic currents. To improve over the tandem\nmission results a spatial spacing of 10 km or less is required as is planned for the future wide swath\naltimetric mission.\n\nIn a classic study of nonlinear mesoscale eddies, Chelton et al. (2011) used data from two\naltimeters (T/P followed by Jason-1 and ERS-1 followed by ERS-2) that were merged by SSALTO/\nDUACS at 7-day intervals on a Mercator grid with a 1/3 degree spacing. This SSALTO/DUACS\nproduct included the removal of the 7-year mean SSH (1993e99) to eliminate the unknown geoid.\nThese SSH fields are referred to by AVISO (French altimetry data distribution system) as the\n\u201creference series.\u201d Their analysis was based on the reference series that was available in early 2010\nthat included SSH fields for the period between October 14, 1992 and December 31, 2008. They\nfound that mesoscale eddies (radius scale of O(100 km)) are readily apparent in these high-resolution\nSSH fields and could be identified with an automated procedure which isolated 35,891 eddies with\nlifetimes >16 weeks. These longer lived eddies were part of the approximately 1.15 million indi-\nvidual eddies identified with an average lifetime of 32 weeks and an average propagation distance of\n550 km. Their mean amplitude and a speed-based radius scale defined by the automated procedure\nwere 8 cm and 90 km, respectively.\n\nAn example of the mapped eddy field is given here in Fig. 9.25. Here it is clear that much of the\nSSH variability is due to energetic mesoscale features; it is also apparent that at lower subtropical\nand tropical latitudes (<20 degrees) in the Pacific there are long crests (middle panel Fig. 9.25) and\ntroughs consistent with Rossby waves that have been distorted into westward pointing patterns by\nrefraction (Chelton et al., 2011). While these features are relatively small in amplitude and are full of\nmuch more energetic mesoscale features, these patterns are identifiable across most of the South\nPacific. They are less evident in the North Pacific in the middle panel of Fig. 9.25 because of the\noverall higher SSG in the northern hemisphere caused summertime steric heating (Fig. 9.25 is an\nAugust map). These patterns become more apparent in the eastern North Pacific when the data are\nspatially high-pass filtered to remove the steric effects of large-scale heating and cooling. Even then\nthese features do not penetrate further than 2000 km westward from the eastern boundary in the\nNorth Pacific.\n\nThe tracked eddies were found to originate nearly everywhere in the World Ocean, consistent with\nprevious conclusions that virtually all of theWorld Ocean is baroclinically unstable. In general, there is\na preference for cyclonic eddies, while eddies with longest lifetimes and greatest propagation distances\ntend to be anticyclonic. There is a tendency toward larger cyclonic eddies in the southern hemisphere,\n\n9.2 SEA SURFACE HEIGHT AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY 673\n\n\n\nFIGURE 9.25\n\nAn example of global maps of sea surface height (SSH) on August 28, 1996 constructed from Topex/Poseidon\n\n(T/P) data only (top) and from the merged T/P and ERS-1 data (middle). The bottom panel is the SSH from\n\nmerged field after spatially high-pass filtering with half-power filter cutoffs of 20 degrees of longitude by\n\n10 degrees of latitude. The automated eddy tracking procedure identifies 3291 eddies in the bottom panel of\n\nwhich 2398 could be tracked for 4 weeks or longer.\n\n674 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nwhile there is an overall preference for anticyclonic eddies in the northern hemisphere. In general,\nthere is no evidence of anisotropy of these eddies of either sign. Most are approximately Gaussian in\nshape, but there is an indication that a quadratic function is a better approximation of the eddy profile\n(Chelton et al., 2011).\n\nChelton et al. (2011) considered that the most significant conclusion of their study was that\nessentially all of the observed mesoscale features outside of the tropical band (20?Se20?N) are\nnonlinear by the metric U/c, where U is the maximum circum-average geostrophic speed within the\neddy interior, and c is the translation speed of the eddy. A value of U/c > 1 indicates that there is fluid\ntrapped within the eddy interior. Many of the eddies were found to be highly nonlinear with U/c > 10.\nThe probability distributions of all the measures of eddy nonlinearity were found to be skewed toward\nlarge values for cyclonic eddies in the southern hemisphere, while they are skewed toward anticyclonic\neddies in the northern hemisphere extratropics. Added evidence of the nonlinear nature of these eddies\nis given by the fact that they propagate nearly due west with propagation speeds that are nearly equal to\nthe long baroclinic Rossby wave phase speed which is twice as fast as that predicted by linear Rossby\nwave theory.\n\nBetween September 2002 and the end of the Geosat Follow-On mission in 2008, there have\nbeen four altimeter missions flying simultaneously. The resulting merged data set has greatly\nimproved the estimate of the surface mesoscale geostrophic currents, and a number of higher\nresolution (1/8 degree) products have been developed for some regional applications. On average,\nthe merged Jason-1 \u00fe ERS-2 \u00fe T/P \u00fe GO maps yield eddy kinetic energy levels 15% higher than\nthe two-satellite configuration of Jason-1 \u00fe ERS-2 (Morrow and Le Traon, 2012). The consistency\nbetween altimetry and coincident maps of SST, tracks of Lagrangian drifters, and tide gauge sea\nlevels was also significantly improved when four satellites were merged compared to the details\navailable when the results from only the two-satellite constellation were available.\n\nA number of studies have tracked the propagation of individual eddies at mid-to-high latitudes\nusing the mapped multimission altimetric SLAs. Different automatic eddy tracking methods have been\ndeveloped and tested on altimetry data such as the Okubu-Weiss parameter (e.g., Isern-Fontanet et al.,\n2003), the skewness of the relative vorticity (Niiler et al., 2003), the wavelet decomposition of the SLA\n(e.g., Lilly et al., 2003), the SLA itself (Fang andMorrow, 2003; Chaigneau and Pizarro, 2005; Chelton\net al., 2011), and a geometric criteria using the winding angle approach (e.g., Souza et al., 2011). The\ndifferent techniques all yield differences in the number of eddies detected, their duration, and their\npropagation velocities. Still, all methods do detect an abundance of mesoscale circulation features in\nthe merged altimetry data set.\n\nThese many studies have revealed that there are definitely \u201ceddy corridors\u201d (Morrow and\nLe Traon, 2012) where eddies are more abundant. In the region south of Madagascar there is the\nregular formation of eddy dipole pairs resulting in a regular train of dipoles in the regions that, for\nexample, started in December 1999 and continued into 2000. This dipole train remained coherent\nand triggered an unusually early retroflection of the Agulhas Current in late 2000. In the south Indian\nOcean, Fang and Morrow (2003) analyzed the pathways of anticyclonic warm-core eddies from 1995\nto 2000. They found long-lived warn-core eddies that could be tracked for periods longer\nthan 6 months and over distances longer than 1500 km. The number of eddies was found to oscillate\nwith the ENSO cycle. All of these features propagated west as they should. Still, it was possible\nto overturn this westward movement of the eddies in regions of very strong currents or bathymetric\nsteering.\n\n9.2 SEA SURFACE HEIGHT AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY 675\n\n\n\nWhile this combination of multiple altimeters has made it possible to map the mesoscale eddy field,\nwe cannot adequately sample the submesoscale. The submesoscale refers to features that surround the\nmesoscale eddies. They are filaments and smaller eddy structures that interact with the mesoscale\neddies. To study them, the altimetric measurements have to be combined with higher resolution\n(1e5 km) sampling systems such as those for SST or work with large eddy simulation numerical\nmodels that can discretely measure these submesoscale features.\n\n9.2.8.3 Application of Satellite Altimetry to Sea Level Rise\nSince the advent of T/P the continuing series of satellite altimeters has made it possible to accurately\nestimate changes in global mean sea level. These measurements are continuously calibrated again a\nnetwork of tide gauges as a reference. To calculate the mean sea level rise, the seasonal and local tidal\nvariations must be first subtracted from the record. This time series is presented here in Fig. 9.26 from\nNerem et al. (2010). A series of three satellite altimeters has been stitched together to create a longtime\nseries of mean sea level from late 1992 to 2013. The interannual variations have been retained in this\nseries, but a long-term line has been fit to the overall series showing the linear increase in sea level at a\nrate of 3.2 ? 0.4 mm per year. The seasonal signals have been removed.\n\nThis rate of sea level rise computed by the University of Colorado compares very well with\nthe rates calculated independently by other groups. The French AVISO group gets 3.2 ? 0.6 mm\nper year, the Australian CSIRO get 3.2 ? 0.4 mm per year, and NOAA gets 3.2 ? 0.4 mm per year.\nThus, it is clear that there is convergence in these estimates, and that sea level in increasing at this\nrather steady level.\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201320\n1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\n\nUniversity of Colorado 2013_rel4\n\nInverse barometer applied, GIA correctd\n\nTOPEX\n\nJason-1\n\nJason-2\n60\u2013day smoothing\n\nRate = 3.2 \u00b1  0.4 mm/yr\nSeasonal signals removed\n\n?M\nSL\n\n (m\nm\n\n)\n\nFIGURE 9.26\n\nGlobal mean sea level (MSL) time series from satellite altimeters (seasonal signals removed).\n\n676 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThis sea level increase has a geographical trend, which can be seen here in Fig. 9.27. Local trends\nhave been calculated with a least-squares fit of 10-day, 0.25 degree resolution grids of sea level. A\ntrend, bias, annual and semiannual terms are fit simultaneously (Nerem et al., 2010). These have been\ncalculated only for the altimeter period (1993e2012). They therefore reflect the impact of decadal\nscale climate variability on the regional distribution of sea level rise. In addition, local SSH trends and\nvariations are a result of many factors, including local crustal displacement, glacial isostatic adjust-\nment, steric effects, and even local wind pattern. All of these effects and some others must be\nconsidered when interpreting these estimates of sea level trends.\n\nTo estimate mean sea level change from altimeter data, it is very important to correct for\naltimeter drift over time. This is done using sea level measured in situ with tide gauges. The method\nused for the CU sea level rise estimates is described in detail in Mitchum (2001). Briefly, the\nmethod creates an altimetric time series at a tide gauge location, and then differences these time\nseries with the time series measured by the tide gauge. In this difference series signals due to\ncommon oceanographic phenomena will largely cancel out leaving a difference time series that\nis dominated by the sum of the altimetric drift and the land motion at the tide gauge site.\nMaking independent estimates of land motion rates and by combining the difference series from a\nlarge number of global tide gauges results in a difference time series that is dominated by\nthe altimeter drift. Since the difference series at separate tide gauge locations have been shown to\nbe statistically almost independent (Mitchum, 1998), the final drift series has a variance that is\nvery much smaller than any of the individual series that contribute to it. Since this results in\nvery large degrees of freedom, this method outperforms altimeter calibrations from dedi-\ncated altimeter calibration sites although it is a relative calibration meaning that it is a relative\nbias and cannot compute an absolute bias. It can, however, detect a change in bias due to an\naltimeter drift.\n\n\u201315 \u201312 \u20139 \u20136 \u20133 0 3 6 9 12 15\nmm/yr\n\nFIGURE 9.27\n\nMap of sea level trends made by the University of Colorado.\n\n9.2 SEA SURFACE HEIGHT AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY 677\n\n\n\nIdeally, one would want to include all of the available tide gauges in the calibration. A number of\nthe gauges, however, have a significant lag in reporting and are not available for real-time Jason\ncalibration. In contrast some of the other stations do not extend backward in time to the T/P mission.\nFor the sea level rise the CU group has restricted the w100 available gauges to a set of 64 near real-\ntime stations that space the T/P period up to the current Jason-2 mission.\n\n9.2.8.4 Estimating Ocean Bathymetry With Altimeter Data\nThe primary principle being invoked in the satellite altimetric mapping of ocean bottom topography is\nthat the surface of the ocean reflects the shape of the ocean floor and it is a matter of teasing this\ninformation out of the satellite altimeter record (Sandwell and Smith, 1995). The bumps and dips in the\nocean surface are caused by small variations in the Earth\u2019s gravitational field. For example, the extra\ngravitational attraction due to a large subsurface mountain on the ocean floor attracts water toward it\nresulting in a local bump at the ocean\u2019s surface. Even for a mountain 2000 m tall with a radius of 20 km\nthe sea surface bump is too small to be seen with the naked eye.\n\nIt can, however, be detected by a satellite altimeter. The US Navy launched the Geosat satellite in\n1985 to map the Earth\u2019s geoid height at a horizontal resolution of 10e15 km and a vertical resolution\nof 0.03 m. Geosat was placed in a nearly polar orbit to obtain a high-latitude coverage.\n\nTwo very precise measurements must be made to establish the topography of the ocean\u2019s surface to\nan accuracy of 0.03 m. First the height of the satellite above the ellipsoid must be measured by tracking\nthe satellite from a globally distributed network of lasers and/or Doppler stations. This height is further\nrefined using orbital dynamic calculations. Second, the height of the satellite above the closest ocean\nsurface is measured with a microwave radar operating in a pulse-limited mode on a carrier frequency\nof 13 GHz. The ocean is a good reflector at this frequency. The large radar spot is narrowed using sharp\nradar pulses and accurately recording the two-way travel time. The footprint of the pulse must be large\nenough to average out the local irregularities in the ocean\u2019s surface due to ocean waves. The spherical\nwaves of the altimeter ensure that the altitude is measured to the closest ocean surface. A high pulse\nrepetition rates (1000 pulses per second) is used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Correction to the\ntravel time is made for ionosphere and atmospheric attenuations and known tidal corrections are also\napplied. The difference between the height above the ellipsoid and the altitude above the ocean surface\nis approximately equal to the geoid height.\n\nThus, as the satellite orbits the Earth it collects a continuous profile of geoid height across an ocean\nbasin. Taken together profiles from many different altimeter satellites collected over many years can be\ncombined to make high-resolution images. Maps of geoid height measurements from 4.5 years of\nGeosat and 2 years of ERS-1 satellite altimeters have been used to compute the gravity anomaly, which\nis then mapped to a grid (Fig. 9.28). These grid values can then be compared with coincident ship-\nbased measurements of the gravity anomaly. These estimates show agreement with ship data at a\nlevel of 5 milligal (mgal), where one mgal is about one-millionth the normal pull of gravity (which is\n9.80665 m/s2). Typical variations in the pull of gravity are 20 mgal although over the deep ocean\ntrenches they can exceed 300 mgal.\n\nThe dense satellite altimeter measurements can be combined with sparse accurate measurements of\nseafloor depth to construct a uniform resolution map of seafloor topography as shown, for example,\nhere in Fig. 9.29. These maps are sufficiently accurate for subsurface navigation, and they are useful\nfor applications such as locating the major obstructions/constrictions to the major ocean currents, and\nlocating shallow seamounts where fish and lobster are more abundant.\n\n678 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nFIGURE 9.28\n\nGlobal map of gravity anomaly calculated from Geosat and ERS-1 altimetry.\n\nFIGURE 9.29\n\nMaps of satellite-derived surface gravity and seafloor topography.\n\n9.2 SEA SURFACE HEIGHT AND SATELLITE ALTIMETRY 679\n\n\n\n9.3 SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n9.3.1 MEASURING AND MAPPING OCEAN WINDS FROM SYNTHETIC\n\nAPERTURE RADAR\nSAR measures the backscatter from the sea surface, which is a measure of the roughness of the ocean\nsurface. This roughness is strongly influenced by the local wind field so that the radar backscatter can be\nused to estimate thewind field (Horstmann et al., 1998). For their study, Horstmann et al. (1998) usedSAR\nimagery fromERS-1 and ERS-2 satelliteswhich both carried a C-bandSAR. The advantage of using SAR\nto compute wind fields is that the resulting wind fields have a very high spatial resolution and the winds\ncan be computed very close to the shoreline providing a major advantage over many other microwave\ntechniques for computing ocean surfacewinds. Because of its potential for providing such high-resolution\ncoastal wind fields, SAR-derived winds complement measurements made from wind scatterometers and\nmicrowave radiometers that yield very coarse-resolution estimates of the oceanic wind fields (Thompson\nand Beal, 2000). Such high-resolution wind fields are important for many coastal applications.\n\nThe spectral density of small-scale surface waves is a strong function of the surface wind stress. In\naddition, the intensity of the electromagnetic field that is transmitted from a radar and backscattered\nfrom the ocean surface is a clear function of this small-scale surface wave spectral density. Thus, there\nis a strong correlation between the wind stress (or wind speed) and the intensity of the backscattered\nradar return. Thus, even early researchers concluded that wind speed could be estimated from radar\nbackscatter.\n\nFor the wind speed calculation from ERS-1 and ERS-2 SAR images, Horstmann et al. (1998) used\nthe empirical C-band model CMOD4 (Stoffelen and Anderson, 1997) and used CMOD IFR2 (Quilfen\nand Bentamy, 1994) to compute wind speeds from the SAR backscatter. Both models were developed\nfor the scatterometer on ERS-1 and 2. These models require input of the normalized radar cross\nsection, the incidence angle of the radar beam, and the wind direction. The radar cross section and\nincidence angle can be derived in a straightforward manner from the details of the ERS SAR\ninstruments. Since small changes in radar cross section result in very large wind speed changes, the\nradar has to be calibrated as accurately as possible. This calibration requirement is discussed further in\nLaur et al. (1997).\n\nThe wind direction can be easily derived if wind streaks are present in the SAR image (Fig. 9.30).\nIn about 65% of the SAR images studied by Horstmann et al. (1998) wind streaks were found to\nbe present from which the wind direction could be extracted. Shadowing of the wind field due\nto coastal topography can remove the 180 degrees ambiguity of the wind direction. For a general\nderivation of the wind direction a 10 km? 10 km subimage was analyzed with a fast Fourier transform\n(FFT) as plotted here in Fig. 9.31. Here the gray levels correspond to energies of the power spectrum,\nwhich are plotted for wavelengths between 500 and 1500 m. The resulting wind direction is\nperpendicular to the dashed line indicating the direction of peak power of the wind streaks.\n\nWithout wind streaks it is not possible from a single azimuth sample to accurately compute\nthe wind direction (Thompson and Beal, 2000). Conventional wind scatterometers must sample at\nleast two independent directions to solve for the wind direction (even then with a 180? ambiguity). An\nindependent estimate of the wind direction is therefore needed to even formulate the wind speed\nretrieval.\n\nEven the use of wind streaks due to coastal shadowing may sometimes result in erroneous wind\ndirections that are almost orthogonal to the in situ measured wind direction (Thompson and Beal,\n2000). One option is to incorporate numerical model estimates of wind direction. These models give\n\n680 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\ndistance in range [km]\n\ndi\nst\n\nan\nce\n\n in\n a\n\nzi\nm\n\nut\nh \n\n[k\nm\n\n]\n\n54.75\u00b0\n\n54.50\u00b0\n\n54.00\u00b0\n\n54.25\u00b0\n\n13.00\u00b0 13.50\u00b0\n\nFIGURE 9.30\n\nSynthetic aperture radar image of the island Ru?gen at the Baltic coast of Germany, from August 12, 1991 at\n\n21:07 UTC from ERS-1.

The main energy is along an orientation of 26 degrees from north;\n\nthe resulting main direction is oriented perpendicular to this line.\n\n\n\nwind directions estimates that are sufficiently reliable that wind speed can be retrieved from the C-\nband models and the SAR image.\n\nHorstmann et al. (1998) used the wind fields from the two ERS satellites to investigate the spatial\nvariability of the ocean wind field. The ERS SAR-derived winds are a snapshot of the ocean surface\nwinds for an area up to 100 km ? 100 km. An example of the SAR wind field on December 1, 1992\nnorthwest of the Shetland Islands is shown here in Fig. 9.32. This image exhibits the expression of\nrange traveling waves with approximately 300 m wavelengths. Wind streaks are used to define the\nsolid lines, which represent the wind directions. Shadowing off the coast of the Shetlands was used to\nremove the 180 degrees directional ambiguity.\n\nThe mean wind direction was used to compute the wind speed with a resolution of 100 m ? 100 m.\nThe resultant mean wind speed was 14 m/s. The wind-speed spectrum was computed from the wind\nspeeds with a two-dimensional FFT, which was then integrated over all directions to produce the one-\ndimensional wave number spectrum shown here in Fig. 9.33. Between wavelengths of 56 and 2 km the\nspectral density decreases in an almost linear fashion. For wavelengths shorter than 2 km the spectral\ndensity increases.

In these different cases the slop of the spectra between 100\nand 2 km varied between ?1.1 and ?1.6, while the slope at wavelengths shorter than 2 km was\napproximately 1. The change in slope at approximately 300 m wavelength is due to the sea state.\n\n9.3.2 DIRECTIONAL WAVE NUMBER SPECTRA FROM SYNTHETIC APERTURE\nRADAR IMAGERY\n\nOcean waves are ubiquitous features that cover the ocean\u2019s surface under most conditions. Surface\nwaves range in wavelength from a few centimeters (capillary waves) to hundreds of meters (for wind\nwaves or swell) with corresponding wave heights that range from millimeters to tens of meters.\nSurface waves are generated by the wind-generated turbulence above the sea at some location. Swell is\ngenerated at a remote location and propagates over the ocean. Ocean surface waves interact with the\natmosphere, ocean currents, with the ocean bottom topography and with each other. Wave energy\neventually dissipates through breaking in open water or upon shoaling.\n\nSAR imagery is uniquely suited to an estimate of ocean surface wave conditions, since SAR is\nthe only satellite sensor that can provide images from space with a high enough resolution independent\nof cloud cover and light conditions. First demonstrated by aircraft sampling in the early 1970s the two-\ndimensional surface wave field can be imaged by SAR. An ERS-1 SAR image of ocean surface waves\nrefracting along a beach and around a headland is shown here in Fig. 9.34.\n\nThe earliest SAR-based mapping of surface waves was carried out using SeaSat SAR imagery\n(Beal et al., 1981). Later Beal et al. (1983) worked to measure the spatial evolution of SeaSat SAR-\nmeasured wave spectra from a SAR pass taken off the US East Coast. They found that the wave\n\n108\n\n107\n\n106\n\n0.0001 0.0010 0.0100\n\n slope = \u20131.11\n\nsp\nec\n\ntra\nl a\n\nm\npl\n\nitu\nde\n\nwavenumber [rad/m]\n\n100 50 20 10 5 2 1 0.5 0.2\nwavelength [km]\n\nFIGURE 9.33\n\nSpectral density versus wave number in logelog coordinates. The spectral density was computed from the\n\nwind-speed spectrum. Corresponding wavelengths are shown beneath the wave numbers in the x-axis.\n\n9.3 SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR OCEAN APPLICATIONS 683\n\n\n\nnumber of the dominant wave spectra changed in a way that was consistent with deepwater wave\ndispersion as the waves propagated away from a storm and interacted with the Gulf Stream.\n\nA similar study was carried out by Sun and Kawamura (2009) using ERS-1 and ERS-2 data both of\nwhich carried the active microwave instrument, which has a SAR operation function in the C-band\nwith VV polarization. These SARs have incidence angles of 20e26 degrees resulting in a SAR\nswath of about 100 km. The resulting SAR images are 6656 pixels in azimuth and 5344 in range. They\nused 5120 ? 5120 pixels of this for their study. The SAR image was divided into 40 ? 40 subimages,\nwhich have approximately 128 ? 128 pixels (about 1.6 km ? 1.6 km). Each subimage is first filtered\nusing a Gaussian high-pass filter to remote the low wavenumber signal, which has no relation to\nsurface waves. An example is presented here in Fig. 9.35 along with various version of the SAR wave\nnumber spectra.\n\nHere the JONSWAP refers to a theoretical spectrum developed by Hasselmann et al. (1973, 1980)\nalong with the directional spreading function proposed by Donelan et al. (1985). Note the symmetrical\nretrievals in the original SAR image spectrum and the filtered SAR image spectrum. At this point there\nis a 180 degrees ambiguity that is only resolved by invoking the JONSWAP model which uses the\nSAR-derived wind speed to give the spectrum a preferred direction as indicated by the spectra in\nFig. 9.35D and E.\n\nThe SAR spectra are always affected by azimuth cutoff, the effect of SAR spectral roll-off in the\nazimuth direction. This azimuth cutoff is caused by the nonlinearity of the SAR surface-wave imaging\nmechanism in the azimuth direction and acts as a low-pass Gaussian filter to the SAR spectra. In the\nERS SAR wave mode products (Johnsen et al., 1999), the cutoff wavelength is a parameter derived\nby fitting a Gaussian function to the range integral SAR spectrum (Vachon et al., 1994; Kerbaol et al.,\n1998; Schulz-Stellenfleth and Lehner, 2007).\n\nFIGURE 9.34\n\nSample ERS-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image of ocean surface waves being (A) refracted around a\n\nheadland, and (B) diffracted in the Strait of Gibraltar.

Most of the ocean is unpopulated and wind measurements on ships are\nfrequently compromised by ship superstructure influences on the wind sensor. As early as the 1940s,\nit was found that ocean waves caused large unwanted echoes on the radar screen when scanning\nat low elevation angles. These backscattered echoes from the sea surface became larger with\nincreasing wind speed. This led to the development of ocean wind scatterometry. The most attractive\nmethod for measuring ocean winds is from satellites. The first satellite-based wind measure-\nments were made from the SeaSat satellite with a NASA scatterometer. A radar scatterometer is\ndesigned to measure the normalized radar cross section (sigma-0) of the ocean\u2019s surface as an\nindication of the ocean surface wind. Scatterometers transmit a radar pulse toward the ocean\nand measure the reflected energy. A separate measurement of the noise-only power is made and\nsubtracted from the reflected signal to determine the backscatter signal power. Sigma-0 is computed\nfrom the signal power measurement using the distributed target radar equation. Scatterometers must\nbe very accurately calibrated to be able to make accurate backscatter measurements.\n\nThe backscattered energy measured by a scatterometer provides a measurement of near-surface\nocean winds. By combining sigma-0 measurements from different azimuth angles, the near-surface\nwind vector over the ocean can be determined using a geophysical model function (GMF), which\nrelates the wind magnitude and radar backscatter. From the ocean surface the backscatter results from\nwind-generated capillaryegravity waves, which are generated when the wind blows over the ocean.\nThe capillary waves are generally in equilibrium with the surface wind over the ocean. The scattering\nmechanism is known as Bragg scattering, which happens when the capillary waves are in resonance\nwith the radar wavelength.\n\nOne disadvantage of scatterometer winds is their low accuracy for low wind speeds, and at the\ninside of a swath, the increasing RMS error at high wind speeds due to representativeness errors (other\ngeophysical parameters not included in the sigma-0 to wind transfer function become important at high\nwind speeds). In addition, the scatterometer operates on a near polar-orbiting weather satellite and\nhence measurements are not collected at strictly synoptic measurement times. This latter is less of a\nproblem now that 4-D variational analysis is the primary method for data assimilation into weather\nforecast models. Other problems have been mentioned like the dependence of the transfer function on\nlocal static stability of the atmosphere (Brown, 1986).\n\nThe very first spaceborne scatterometer was the SeaSat-A scatterometer system (SASS) that flew\nfor about 90 days in 1978. This was a \u201cfan-beam\u201d system with the two beam antennas varying from\n25 to 55 degrees. SASS was a Ku-band radar with a wavelength of 2.1 cm at a frequency of\n14.599 GHz. Thirteen years later ESA launched ERS-1, which carried a C-band scatterometer\n(wavelength of 5.7 cm). The ERS-1 scatterometer differed from SASS in that the radar antennas\nwere mounted only on one side of the satellite illuminating a 500-km-wide swath to the right side of\nthe subsatellite track. Instead of two antennas, it carried three: one pointed at 45 degrees (fore beam),\none at 90 degrees (midbeam), and 135 degrees (aft beam) relative to the line of satellite propagation.\nThus, the incidence angle of the radar beam varied from 18 to 47 degrees for the midbeam and from\n25 to 569 degrees for the fore and aft beams. The 500-km-wide swath of the ERS-1 scatterometer\n\n686 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nwas sampled every 25 km. The sampling distance along the swath is also 25 km. Adjacent\nmeasurements across the swath are not independent due to the effective spatial resolution of the\ninstrument of 50 km (overlapping footprints).\n\nThe computation of the wind vector from the different scatterometer views is a nonlinear inversion\nprocess based on an accurate knowledge of the GMF (in an empirical or semiempirical form) that\nrelates the radar backscatter to the vector wind retrieval. To retrieve the wind vector this requires that\nthe scatterometer makes several backscatter measurements of the same spot from different azimuth\nangles. Many scatterometers use fan-beam stick antennas with complimentary orientations to enable\nthe retrieval of the wind vector. These scatterometer designs require considerable power and mass\nand are often difficult to accommodate on spacecraft. An option is for a single-beam scanning\nscatterometer such as that flown on the QuikSCAT satellite (Fig. 9.36). This satellite carried NASA\u2019s\nSeawinds scatterometer. This satellite mission was conceived of as a \u201cquick recovery\u201d mission\nreplacing the NASA scatterometer (NSCAT), which failed prematurely in June 1997 after just\n9.5 months of operation. QuikSCAT exceeded all expectations and operated successfully for over a\ndecade until a bearing failure on its antenna scan motor rendered the instrument useless on November\n23, 2009 after a launch on June 19, 1999.\n\nThis instrument uses a rotating dish antenna with two spot beams that sweep in a circular pattern.\nThe antenna consists of a 1 m diameter rotating dish that produces two spot beams sweeping in a\ncircular pattern. It radiates 110 W microwave pulses at a pulse repetition frequency of 189 Hz.\nQuikSCAToperates at a frequency of 13.4 GHz, which is in the Ku-band of microwave frequencies. At\nthis frequency the atmosphere is mostly transparent to nonprecipitating clouds and aerosols, although\nrain significant attenuates the signal.\n\nThe spacecraft is in a Sun-synchronous orbit, with equatorial crossing times of ascending swaths\nat about 06:00 LST ?30 min. Along the equator, consecutive swaths are separated by 2800 km.\nQuikSCATorbits the Earth at an altitude of 802 km at a speed of about 7 km/s. During its operational\nlifetime, QuikSCAT measured winds in measurement swaths 1800 km wide centered on the\n\nFIGURE 9.36\n\nThe QuikSCAT satellite with NASA\u2019s Seawinds instrument at the bottom.\n\n9.4 OCEAN WIND SCATTEROMETRY 687\n\n\n\nsatellite\u2019s ground track with no nadir gap such as occurs with fan-beam antennas. Because of its wide\nswath and lack of in swath gaps, QuikSCATwas able to collect at least one wind vector measurement\nover 93% of the World\u2019s Ocean each day. This improved significantly over the 77% coverage\nprovided by NSCAT each day. Each day QuikSCAT recorded over 400,000 measurements of wind\nspeed and direction. This is hundreds of times more surface wind measurements than are routinely\ncollected from ships and buoys.\n\nA limitation of QuikSAT is that wind vectors cannot be retrieved within 15e30 km of coastlines or\nin the presence of sea ice. Precipitation generally degrades the wind measurement accuracy although\nuseful wind and rain information can still be obtained in midlatitudes and tropical cyclones (Fig. 9.37).\nIn addition to retrieving the wind vector the scatterometer has proven to be useful in estimating the\nfractional coverage of sea ice, tracking large (>5 km long) icebergs, differentiating between different\ntypes of ice and snow, and detecting the freezeethaw line in polar regions.\n\nFIGURE 9.37\n\nQuikSCAT image of Hurricane Katrina August 28, 2005.\n\n688 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n9.4.2 SEA SURFACE SALINITY\nSSS can be remotely measured using microwave radiometry at L-band (Swift and McIntosh, 1983).\nDuring the late 1940s and early 1950s, laboratory experiments were conducted to quantify the\nrelationship between salinity and BT. Until ESA\u2019s SMOS, only two (experimental) spaceborne radi-\nometers at L-band had been launched, in Cosmos 243 (1968) and in Skylab S-194 (1973), but the first\nevidence from space came only from the Skylab observations (Fig. 9.38).\n\nThe link between salinity and BT is through the dielectric constant of sea water. The \u201cprotected\u201d\n1.400e1.427 MHz band represents the optimum trade-off between sensitivity, atmospheric and\nionospheric effects, and spectrum protection. Still, salinity measurements are very difficult to make\nbecause of the low sensitivity of BT to SSS, 0.2e0.8 K/psu (psu \u00bc practical salinity unit, roughly 1 g\nof salt per 1 kg of water). The dependence on the physical temperature (Fig. 9.39), surface roughness\n(induced by local wind or by far waves), incidence angle, and polarization, on one hand, and the\ntechnical difficulties to achieve a highly stable and accurately calibrated microwave radiometer, and\nthe presence of RFI, make it a challenging observable.\n\nThe first SSS airborne map was obtained in 1996 using the scanning low-frequency microwave\nradiometer (SLFMR), a six-beam real aperture radiometer (Fig. 9.40A) (Miller et al., 1996). In 2000,\nthe first SSS airborne map was obtained using the electronically steered thinned array radiometer\n(ESTAR) (LeVine et al., 2000) (Fig. 9.40B).\n\nIn 1995, ESA organized the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Workshop to define the roadmap to\nremotely measure these two geophysical variables, and it was concluded that the most promising\ntechnique was aperture synthesis radiometry, which had been successfully demonstrated a few years\nearlier with the ESTAR instrument (Ruf et al., 1998). In 1998, an international team of scientists led by\nDr. Y.H. Kerr (CESBIO, France) and Dr. J. Font (ICM/CSIC, Spain) proposed the SMOS mission to\nESA, which was selected as the second Earth Explorer Opportunity Mission (Silvestrin et al., 2001)\nwithin the ESA Living Planet Programme. Finally, SMOS was successfully launched on November 2,\n2009 from Plesetsk, Russia (Fig. 9.41).\n\nFIGURE 9.38\n\nAntenna temperature and salinity correlation in Skylab data (http://aquarius.umaine.edu/images/ov_skylab_\n\ndata.jpg).\n\n9.4 OCEAN WIND SCATTEROMETRY 689\n\nhttp://aquarius.umaine.edu/images/ov_skylab_data.jpg\nhttp://aquarius.umaine.edu/images/ov_skylab_data.jpg\n\n\nHowever, when SMOS was selected in May 1999, there were still many uncertainties and many\nlessons to learn. In particular, for an accurate salinity retrieval, there were three key issues to be\naddressed: an accurate characterization of the impact of salinity and temperature on the dielectric\nconstant, an accurate characterization of the impact of the sea state (wind speed, SWH, etc.), and foam\non the BTs.\n\nFIGURE 9.39\n\nBrightness temperature at nadir dependence with sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity\n\n(Swift, 1980).\n\nFIGURE 9.40\n\nFirst sea surface salinity maps derived from L-band microwave radiometry using (A) a real aperture radiometer\n\n(Miller et al., 1996) and (B) a synthetic aperture radiometer in 2000 (LeVine et al., 2000).\n\n690 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nTwo of the most widely used dielectric constant models are those of Klein and Swift (1977) and\nEllison et al. (1998), and although they show similar results, their differences are too large to meet the\nsalinity retrieval accuracy requirements, i.e., for an absolute accuracy of 0.2 psu, the BT must be on the\norder of 0.1K for cold waters (Fig. 9.43). Blanch and Aguasca (2004) and LeVine et al. (2011)\ndeveloped new experimental setups to develop more accurate models. In general, there is a better\nagreement with the Klein and Swift model, while the Ellison model tends to overestimate the\ncomputed BT. However, it is difficult to warrant the absolute accuracy of this model because of the lack\nof absolute references.\n\nFIGURE 9.41\n\n(A) SMOS artist\u2019s view in orbit, (B) SMOS launch team with ROCKOT launcher at Plesetsk, Russia.\n\n(A) From ESA-Pierre Carril. http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2009/09/SMOS_in_orbit3\n\n(A) (B) (C)\n\nFIGURE 9.42\n\n(A) Location of the REPSOL Casablanca oil rig in the Mediterranean coast of Catalonia.

Additionally, only a few airborne\nexperiments had been carried out, mostly with the SLFMR real aperture radiometer (Miller et al.,\n1996; Hollinger, 1971), and one with the ESTAR synthetic aperture radiometer (LeVine et al., 2000).\nAlmost 30 years later, in 1999 ESA sponsored the WInd and Salinity Experiment (WISE) on the\nREPSOL Casablanca oil rig (40.72?N 1.36?E), w50 km offshore of the coast of Tarragona (Spain),\nand w115 km south of Barcelona (see Fig. 9.42).\n\nTwo WISE campaigns took place (November 2000 to January 2001, and October to November\n2001). The instruments deployed were (Fig. 9.43) the LAURA (L-band AUtomatic RAdiometer)\nfrom the Universitat Polite?cnica de Catalunya (Spain), the first fully polarimetric (four Stokes\nparameters) L-band radiometer, a Ka-band polarimetric radiometer from the University of Massa-\nchussetts (USA), a stereocamera to determine surface topography and root mean square slopes of the\nsea surface from CETP (France), four oceanographic and climatological buoys for near-surface\nsalinity and temperature measurements using the SeaBird MicroCAT system (model SBE37-SM),\nas well as wind speed and direction, wave height, and period, etc. from the Institute of Marine\nSciences (ICM/CSIC, Spain) and LODYC (now LOCEAN, France), a portable meteorological\nstation with atmospheric pressure, air temperature, relative humidity and rain rate, and a video\ncamera mounted on the L-band radiometer pedestal to determine sea surface foam coverage from the\nUniversitat Polite?cnica de Catalunya (Spain), and an IR radiometer to determine SST estimates from\nthe Universitat de Vale?ncia (Spain). Additionally, during WISE 2000, temperature and salinity were\nrecorded from the platform at 5 m below sea level, and simultaneously ocean color, wind vector, and\nSST were acquired by different satellites.\n\n(A) (B) (C)\n\nFIGURE 9.43\n\nSome of the instrumentation deployed during WISE 2000 and 2001: (A) LAURA installed and acquiring data\n\nfrom the 32 m height deck (UPC), (B) Aanderaa CMB3280 (meteorological buoy, ICM/CSIC), (C) underwater\n\nview of the oceanographic buoy (ICM/CSIC).\n\n692 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThe main result of the WISE campaigns was the determination of the BT dependence on the 10 m\nheight wind speed and the SWH required to perform the necessary corrections to retrieve SSS (Camps\net al., 2002, 2004; Gabarro? et al., 2004), including a weak azimuthal signature, which was more clearly\nseen during a very intense storm that occurred on November 2001. These results were used in one of\nthe SMOS salinity retrieval algorithms, which was later refined, once satellite data became available\n(Guimbard et al., 2012).\n\nOne of the open questions fromWISE 2000 and 2001 was the evident modulation of the BTs when\na patch of foam appeared in the antenna beam (Fig. 9.44). This was confirmed by the IR images, in\nwhich the foam patches appeared as hot spots. To quantify this effect, as well as the impact of rain and\noil spills, and to validate the existing numerical models, the FROG 2003 (foam, rain, oil spills, and\nGPS reflections) experiment was performed at the IRTA facilities at Poblenou del Delta (Tarragona,\nSpain) to study specifically the impact of foam, rain, and oil spills on sea surface emissivity (Camps\net al., 2005). Results indicated that the foam impact is not negligible and should also be included in the\nemission model at L-band.\n\nAfter the successful launch of SMOS in 2009 (Kerr et al., 2010; Font et al., 2010), and a long\ncommissioning phase of 6 months, which was needed to learn many lessons from a new type of in-\nstrument, a new type of multiangular and polarimetric L-band measurements, SSS maps started to be\nproduced (as well as soil moisture maps, see Chapter 11). Since ESA policy covers only up to the level\n2 processing, individual ESA state members are responsible for the processing of the higher levels. In\nthe case of SMOS, there are two of these centers: the CATDS (Centre d\u2019Aval et Traitement des\nDonne?es SMOS) in Toulouse, France, and the CP34 (Centro de Procesado de niveles 3 y 4 de SMOS)\nin the SMOS Barcelona Expert Center (BEC), Barcelona, Spain. The data produced at BEC are served\nin netCDF format and are freely distributed to the scientific community by means of OPENDAP,\nHTTPServer, and NetcdfSubset services through a THREDDS server. Maps produced by BEC can also\nbe visualized online by means of a Web Map Service (http://cp34-bec.cmima.csic.es/data/available-\nproducts). Sample products from BEC are provided in Fig. 9.45, which show salinity maps derived\nusing novel image reconstruction algorithms (Gonza?lez-Gambau et al., 2016) and novel retrieval\ntechniques more robust to RFI (Olmedo et al., 2016).\n\nInitially approved as a NASA Earth System Science Pathfinder program in 2001, Aquarius was\nconfirmed as a mission in September 2005 (Le Vine et al., 2010). The Aquarius/SAC-D mission\nwas developed collaboratively between NASA and Argentina\u2019s space agency, Comisio?n Nacional\nde Actividades Espaciales (CONAE) to best meet the goals of each agency while giving priority\nto salinity measurements. In June 2010, it was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California.\nThe technology used in Aquarius was a three beam push-broom noise-injection radiometer, and a radar\nto perform the sea surface roughness correction. In June 2015, after a failure in the power system, the\nmission is over. At present, there are no follow-on missions to measure the ocean salinity.\n\n9.4.3 BATHYMETRY AND BENTHIC HABITATS MAPPING IN SHALLOW WATERS\nCoastal ecosystems are very important for life quality (most of the world\u2019s population lives in the\ncoasts) and global climate.

Efficient management of the benthic zone for ecological or economic\n\n9.4 OCEAN WIND SCATTEROMETRY 693\n\nhttp://cp34-bec.cmima.csic.es/data/available-products\nhttp://cp34-bec.cmima.csic.es/data/available-products\n\n\n(B)\n\n(A)\n\nFIGURE 9.44\n\n(A) Picture taken from 32-m-high deck of the Casablanca oil rig.

Satellite-based imaging systems with spectral bands within the visible spec-\ntrum can provide reliable information at the spatial and temporal scales needed to estimate bathymetry\nand distribution of benthic habitats in the shallow water environments.\n\nCoastal regions bathymetry can be estimated using a radiative transfer model of the radiance\ncoming from the Sun, which is partly scattered in the sea surface producing the sunglint, and partly\npasses through the water column, gets reflected in the sea bottom, and passes through the water column\nagain in the upwelling path (e.g., Zhongping et al., 2007; Lyons et al., 2011; Collin and Hench, 2012).\nIn Eugenio et al. (2015), an improved algorithm is presented to perform the atmospheric correction and\nSun deglinting to high resolution (0.5 m) WorldView-2 multispectral imagery prior to the development\nof bathymetric and benthic maps. The algorithm is based on the 6S accurate radiative transfer model,\nand it is applicable to turbid and optically shallow waters.\n\nBathymetric maps computed using the above method are able to reproduce depths up to\napproximately 25 m. The subsequent mapping of benthic habitats is a complex problem because only\nlimited and noisy spectral information is available. Depending on the depth, only three to four\nWorldView-2 bands could be useful. The use of seafloor normalized indexes (see Table I of Eugenio\net al., 2015), which include bathymetric information, provides an improved performance, with respect\nto the classical classification methods directly applied to the seafloor albedo or spectral bands.\nFig. 9.46 shows an example of the Granadilla coast in Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) of the\natmospheric and sunglint corrected WorldView-2 imagery, the seafloor albedo, and the bathymetry\nmaps. After the bathymetry maps have been derived, the classification map of the benthic habitats for\nthe same region is derived and satisfactorily compared to the CIMA 2008 map derived from in situ\nmeasurements. The obvious advantage of these new techniques as compared to traditional sampling\ntechniques is the synoptic view of the whole area and the reduced revisit time (Fig. 9.47).\n\nFIGURE 9.46\n\nSelected areas on the WV2 images of Granadilla (Tenerife, Canary Islands) coastal area: (A) atmospheric and\n\nsunglint corrected imagery, (B) seafloor albedo (coastal blue-green-blue bands), and (C) maps of estimated\n\ndepth (bathymetry).\n\n696 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n9.4.4 SARGASSUM SAGA: SPOTTING SEAWEED FROM SPACE\nEach year a bizarre epidemic emerges upon thousands of miles of coastline, stretching from the\nCaribbean Islands to the Gulf States. This visitation has been considered an unpredictable act of nature\nand a detriment to beaches everywhere as long as it has existed. It seems now, however, that the tides of\nchange are sweeping in. The visitor is called sargassum, a macroalgae related to kelp or seaweed.\nDespite sargassum being considered a nuisance for most of its existence, the Sargassum Early Advisory\nSystem (SEAS) of Texas A&M University at Galveston (TAMUG) is making huge leaps to learn more\nabout the macroalgae. Thanks to their work it is now apparent that not only can sargassum be tracked and\npredicted through the USGS\u2019s Landsat imagery, but that providing this information to the public saves\nthe taxpayers\u2019 money and takes away many of the inconveniences of the sargassums\u2019 arrival. SEAS uses\nmany oceanographic techniques to deliver accurate predictions of the time, location, and severity of\nsargassum landings. The SEAS predictive model is 90% accurate, forecasting sargassums\u2019 arrival up to\n2 weeks out. The primary means of tracking the large sargassum mats is through USGS\u2019s Landsat\nimagery. Weather buoys and beach cameras are also used for accurate monitoring of current weather\nconditions and confirmation of sargassum landings. The SEAS team has developed effective yet simple\nmethods for spotting and correctly identifying sargassum through the use of USGS Landsat imagery\n(Fig. 9.48). Researchers look for irregularities in the water, caused by the sargassum mats, which are\nreferred to as \u201cslicks.\u201d These are areas of irregular disrupted water adjacent to a mat, which may be too\nsmall to be detected itself; the slicks appear as dark dendritic veins, through the water.\n\nThe SEAS team has focused a large part of its energy and resources on getting USGS\u2019s Landsat\ninformation out to the public whether that would be a school or beach managers. High schools were\nspecifically targeted as a way to reach out to the public. Students were invited to TAMUG\u2019s computer\nlaboratories and trained in the processes of analyzing Landsat images. In every instance the SEAS\nteam was successful in training the students, so much so that they continued to analyze the images at\n\nFIGURE 9.47\n\n(A) Location of the test stations and transects.

The public is beginning to see\nthat if they understand sargassum and its natural cycle that it can be planned around and no longer\ndisrupt their beach plans. Beach managers were a target audience for the useful information that can be\ngleaned from analyzing the USGS Landsat data. It now allows them to know the amount of sargassum\nto expect as well as when and where to expect it. This means that the sargassum is cleaned up and dealt\nwith more efficiently. This saves the taxpayers money and reduces the inconvenience to the tourists\ncoming to enjoy a pristine beach. SEAS utilizes Landsat imagery to aid the local beach managers and\ncommunities in building a base of citizens who strive to solve problems in the most environmentally\nand economically savvy ways possible (Brandon N. Hill, SEAS/TAMUG).\n\n9.5 CONCLUSIONS\nSatellite remote sensing of the ocean has grown from early applications of weather satellite imagery\nfor sensing and mapping SST to dedicated ocean measurement systems such as satellite altimeters. A\nmajor event in this development was the launch of the short-lived SeaSat satellite in 1979. While this\nsatellite unfortunately only operated for 90 days, it demonstrated the potential of studying the ocean\nwith a series of microwave instruments such as the altimeter, the scatterometer, and the SAR. It took a\nperiod of time for the community to finally organize satellites to make these measurements individ-\nually but SeaSat really showed the way.\n\nAt the same time the weather satellites have improved, but unfortunately their numbers have gone\ndown. A big change, however, has been the change to the free distribution of all of the weather and\nother ocean satellite data. This online access to all of these data has revolutionized their study\nand opened avenues to research that would not have been possible without this ready and free-of-\ncharge availability to these satellite data.\n\nFIGURE 9.48\n\nThis Landsat image (Path 25 Row 40, acquired May 18, 2012) displays a mat of sargassum approaching the\n\nTexas shoreline.\n\n698 CHAPTER 9 OCEAN APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nToday we have a relative long series of satellite altimeter data that continues. We also have moved\noptical measurements from just IR measurements of SST to instruments designed to measure ocean\ncolor as an indication of biological productivity in the ocean. Scatterometers have demonstrated their\nability to provide high-resolution maps of winds over the ocean. Altimeters have proved useful not\nonly in mapping mesoscale and longer-scale ocean currents but also for mapping SWH. SARs have\nprovided high-resolution maps of wind fields, frequency-wave number spectra of wave fields and the\nmapping of ships on the sea surface.\n\n9.6 STUDY QUESTIONS\n\n1. What are the fundamental differences between the IR and microwave measurements of SST?\nWhat correction factors do you need to consider for each? How would you propose to merge\nthese different SSTs together to take best advantage of each of their advantages? What\nmeasurements would you use to validate SST products?\n\n2. How would you combine satellite altimetry, SST and ocean color measurements to map\nmesoscale ocean eddies? What benefits do you have by using multiple data sources to map these\neddies?

What about before launch, how is the calibration tested and evaluated?\n\n8. How can SAR be used for ocean studies. How is SAR different from optical images of the same\nscene? What is the biggest problem with SAR and how can it be reduced?\n\n9. How can satellite altimetry be used to map long-term sea level rise?

Discuss how a satellite altimeter measures the SWH. How is this SWH used in practice and as an\neconomic product?\n\n9.6 STUDY QUESTIONS 699\n\n\n\nLAND APPLICATIONS 10\n10.1 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT\nThe US remote sensing of land parameters has an interesting history. Initially people started to use\nweather satellite imagery to estimate some important land characteristics like the health of vegetation.\nSoon it was clear that more focused remote sensing was needed for the land, and the early Earth\nResources Technology Satellite (ERTS) was born out of the NASA NIMBUS program. This then gave\nrise to the US Landsat program, which was a collaboration between NASA and the United States\nGeological survey (USGS). This program went through a phase where it was unsuccessfully\ncommercialized, and it is now back in the hands of NASA and the USGS.\n\nDuring their evolution, the Landsat satellites have seen dramatic changes in the types of sensors\nthat they flew to sense the Earth\u2019s surface. Vegetation was not the driving factor, but sensing geological\nresources were more important. Thus, the Landsat satellites did not fly in a diurnal repeating orbit, but\nrather in a 15-day repeat orbit. In addition the Landsat sensor swath widths were fairly narrow and did\nnot overlap at the equator. It took a number of days for a single Landsat instrument to image the entire\nglobe.\n\nThe first ERTS satellite was launched on July 23, 1972. This satellite carried two instruments: a\ncamera built by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) called the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV), and\nthe multispectral scanner (MSS) system built by the Hughes Aircraft Company (El Segundo, Cali-\nfornia) under contract to NASA. The MSS recorded data in four spectral bands, green, red, and two\nnear-infrared bands. These data were the source of over 300 scientific investigations funded by NASA.\nThe RBV was intended to be the primary instrument, but the MSS data were quickly found to be\nsuperior to the RBV observations. In addition the RBV instrument was the source of an electrical\ntransient that caused the satellite to briefly lose attitude control therefore compromising image data\ncollection.\n\nThis first of the soon to become Landsat satellite series was based on NASA\u2019s successful NIMBUS\nseries and used the same basic bus structure to support the mission (Fig. 10.1). In 1976 the then director\nof the USGS Dr. V.E. McKelvey reported \u201cThe ERTS spacecraft represents the first step in merging\nspace and remote sensing technologies into a system for inventorying and managing the Earth\u2019s\nresources.\u201d Landsat 1 operated until January 1978, outliving its design life by 5 years. It demonstrated\nthe value of the MSS collecting over 300,000 images of the Earth\u2019s land surfaces.\n\nThis satellite was placed into a 99 degrees polar orbit with a 10 a.m. local time equatorial crossing\ntime. Its orbital period was approximately 100 min, which resulted in about 14e15 orbits per day. The\nsatellite altitude was nominally 900 km.\n\nCHAPTER\n\nIntroduction to Satellite Remote Sensing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809254-5.00010-5\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n701\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809254-5.00010-5\n\n\nLandsat 2 also used the NIMBUS bus as the satellite platform and was again operated by NASA. It\nwas launched on January 22, 1975. As this satellite was again considered experimental it carried the\nsame instruments as Landsat 1. On February 25, 1982, after seven years of successful service Landsat 2\nwas taken out of operation due to serious yaw control problems that made it impossible to accurately\npoint the satellite sensors.\n\nLandsat 3 was again based on the NIMBUS satellite bus and was launched on March 5, 1978 and\nimmediately put in standby mode. It began operation later in 1978 and operated until September 7,\n1983. It carried the same sensors as Landsats 1 and 2. The MSS now had five spectral bands with two\nvisible (0.5e0.6 mm, 0.6e0.7 mm), two near infrared (0.7e0.8 mm, 0.8e1.1 mm), and one thermal\ninfrared (10.4e12.6 mm). The pixel size was roughly 57 ? 79 m, and the scene size was\n170 km ? 185 km. As before, the swaths did not overlap at the equator, and it took a number of days\nfor a single satellite to image the entire globe.\n\nA major change came with Landsat 4 and 5. The spacecraft was completely redesigned and\noptimized for this Earth application. The RBV instrument was dropped and the MSS continued to fly.\nIn addition, a new imager called the thematic mapper (TM) was added that had improved spectral and\nspatial resolutions. It could see a wider portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and had a better spatial\nresolution to see greater detail on the ground. The spectral channels, included the blue, green, red and\nnear infrared, the mid-infrared (2 bands), and the thermal infrared portions of the spectrum. The spatial\nresolution improved from 80 m to about 30 m.\n\nFIGURE 10.1\n\nEarth resources technology satellite or Landsat 1 (https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-data-continuity-\n\nmission/).\n\n702 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\nhttps://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-data-continuity-mission/\nhttps://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-data-continuity-mission/\n\n\nLandsat 4 lost two of its solar panels and both of its direct downlink antennas less than a year after\nits launch July 16, 1982. Thus, data downlink was not possible until NASA launched their Tracking\nand Data Relay Satellite (TDRSS). After that Landsat 4 could transmit data via its Ku-band transmitter\nfrom which TDRSS could then relay these data to the ground. This downlink via TDRSS continued\nuntil 1993 when this last remaining data downlink failed on Landsat 4. The satellite was kept on orbit\nfor housekeeping telemetry command and tracking data until it was decommissioned in 2001. While\nNASA built and launched Landsat 4, it was initially operated by National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) until the operations were contracted out to the Earth Observation Satellite\nCompany (EOSAT) in 1984 as part of the Landsat commercialization effort.\n\nThe year Landsat 5 was launched (1984) the US Congress decided that land remote sensing\nsatellites could be privatized in the 1984 Land Remote Sensing Commercialization Act. NOAA, the\nagency in charge of Landsat operations, was instructed to find a commercial vendor for Landsat data.\nNOAA selected the Earth Observation Satellite Company (EOSAT), which was a partnership between\nHughes Aircraft and RCA. The contract gave EOSAT the responsibility for archiving, collecting, and\ndistributing current Landsat data as well as the responsibility for building, launching, and operating the\nfollowing two Landsat satellites (with government subsidies).\n\nCommercialization was very difficult: EOSAT had limited commercial freedom under this\ncongressional act and it therefore increased the price of Landsat imagery from $650 to $3700, and\neventually $4400. This priced the data out of the reach of most of the researchers who wanted to work\nwith it and as a result further reduced the income of EOSAT. Only large commercial users such as oil and\nmining companies could afford these data and since a lot of research was still needed to make these data\nuseful this research was stopped as a consequence of this price hike. As a result, many users migrated to\nthe free low-resolution land data being provided by meteorological satellites. In 1986, France launched\nSPOT a Landsat-like satellite, which broke the US monopoly further reducing the EOSAT market.\n\nDuring this period of EOSAT commercialization even the data collection standards were reduced.\nMany Landsat image data collects were missed because there were no obvious and immediate buyers\nof these data. In a truly commercial enterprise, data are only collected for a customer with a scientific\npurpose. For a scientific program you collect all the data that you can for present and future study. In\naddition the Landsat 4 and 5 system calibration activities were not kept up during this same period of\ntime again because the users of these data were not particularly interested in calibration.\n\nIn 1989, with two aging satellites and no operational budget, NOAA directed EOSAT to turn the\nsatellite off. The program was only saved by a strong protest from Congress and foreign and domestic\ndata users (such as oil companies) and a direct intervention by the US Vice President. In response, the\nCongress passed the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992, which instructed Landsat program\nmanagement to build a government-owned Landsat 7, which followed the failure to achieve orbit of\nLandsat 6, which was built by EOSAT.\n\nTwo years after the launch of Landsat 7 EOSAT (later Space Imaging) returned operational\nresponsibility for Landsat 4 and 5 back to the US government. On July 1, 2001, when this transfer\noccurred space imaging also relinquished their commercial rights to Landsat data, which were now\ntransferred to the USGS to sell Landsat data according to USGS pricing policy. While this pricing was\ninitially also too high, USGS has now realized that the best price for science users of Landsat data is\nfree and all of the data are available on the web for no cost.\n\nLandsat 8 (Fig. 10.2), called the \u201cLandsat Data Continuity Mission\u201d, was developed by NASA.\nWhile the orbital characteristics were to be maintained, it was decided to have all new instruments. The\n\n10.1 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 703\n\n\n\nfirst would be a visible only sensor, which became known as the Operational Land Imager (OLI), built\nby Ball Aerospace. The thermal infrared was now assigned to a multichannel infrared instrument\nknown as the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS).\n\nLandsat 8 was launched on February 11, 2013, from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, on an\nAtlas-V 401 rocket, with the extended payload fairing (EPF) from United Launch Alliance, LLC. The\noperational land imager (OLI) and the TIRS provide seasonal coverage of the global landmass at a\nspatial resolution of 30 m (visible, NIR, SWIR); 100 m (thermal), and 15 m (panchromatic).\n\nLandsat 8 was developed as collaboration between NASA and the USGS. NASA led the design,\nconstruction, launch, and on-orbit calibration phases, during which time the satellite was called the\nLandsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). On May 30, 2013, the USGS took over routine operations\nand the satellite became Landsat 8. USGS leads postlaunch calibration activities, satellite operations,\ndata product generation, and data archiving at the Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS)\ncenter.\n\nLandsat 8 instruments represent an evolutionary advance in technology. OLI improves on past\nLandsat sensors using a technical approach demonstrated by a sensor flown on NASA\u2019s experimental\nEO-1 satellite. OLI is a push-broom sensor with a four-mirror telescope and 12-bit quantization. OLI\ncollects data for visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared spectral bands as well as a panchro-\nmatic band. It has a 5-year design life. The graphic below compares the OLI spectral bands to Landsat\n70s ETM\u00fe bands. OLI provides two new spectral bands, one tailored especially for detecting cirrus\nclouds, and the other for coastal zone observations.\n\nThe OLI collects data for two new bands, a coastal band (band 1) and a cirrus band (band 9), as well\nas the heritage Landsat multispectral bands. Additionally, the bandwidth has been refined for six of\nthe heritage bands. The TIRS carries two additional thermal infrared bands. A comparison between the\nchannels available with the extended thematic mapper (ETM) on Landsat 7 and the combination of the\n\nFIGURE 10.2\n\nLandsat 8 on orbit configuration.\n\n704 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nOLI and TIS on Landsat 8 is shown here in Fig. 10.3. The background shows the atmospheric windows\nin these different bands.\n\nFrom this figure it is very clear that the new combination of the OLI and TIS does an excellent job\nof covering the land reflected and emission spectrum.\n\nTIRS collects data for two narrower spectral bands in the thermal region formerly covered by one\nwide spectral band on Landsats 4e7. The 100 m TIRS data are registered to the OLI data to create\nradiometrically, geometrically, and terrain-corrected 12-bit data products. Landsat 8 is required to\nreturn 400 scenes per day to the USGS data archive (150 more than Landsat 7 is required to capture).\nLandsat 8 has been regularly acquiring 550 scenes per day, while Landsat 7 is acquiring 438 scenes per\nday. This increases the probability of capturing cloud-free scenes for the global landmass. The Landsat\n8 scene size is 185-km-cross-track by 180-km-along-track. The nominal spacecraft altitude is 705 km.\nCartographic accuracy of 12 m or better, including compensation for terrain effects, is required for\nLandsat 8 data.\n\nA good summary of the Landsat satellite series is provided here in this timeline (Fig. 10.4)\nbeginning with Landsat 1 in 1972 and extending into the future past Landsat 8, which is now operating.\n\nFIGURE 10.4\n\nLandsat timeline.\n\nFIGURE 10.3\n\nComparison of Landsat 7 ETM bands with those of the OLI and TIS on Landsat 8. The background gray\n\nshades indicate the atmospheric windows in those wavelengths.\n\nFrom https://deforestationwatch.wordpress.com/tag/landsat-8/.\n\n10.1 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 705\n\nhttps://deforestationwatch.wordpress.com/tag/landsat-8/\n\n\nIt shows the durations and overlaps of each mission including our expectations for Landsat 8 and the\npresent plans for Landsat 9, which will again be a collaboration between NASA and USGS. This\ntimeline shows that at present both Landsat 7 and 8 are operating although Landsat 7 is somewhat\nrestricted in its scan due to a problem with the scan correction, but still it provides useful imagery for\ncomparison and combination with Landsat 8 imagery.\n\n10.2 LANDSAT APPLICATIONS\nThe Landsat home page (http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov) offers an interesting matrix of applications that\nis reproduced here as Table 10.1. Some of these applications will be discussed in more detail in the\nfollowing sections.\n\n10.2.1 MONITORING DEFORESTATION\nBrazil contains about 30% (3,562,800 km2) the world\u2019s tropical forest. The estimated average\ndeforestation rate from 1978 to 1988 was 15,000 km2 per year. Systematic cutting of the forest\nvegetation starts along roads and then fans out to create \u201cfeather\u201d or \u201cfishbone\u201d patterns as seen in the\n1986 image (Fig. 10.5). Here we present a Landsat image of the state of Rondonia, Brazil. The 1975\nand 1986 images are MSS data while the 1992 is TM. The deforested land and urban areas appear in\nlight blue, while healthy vegetation appears red. Note that the area clear-cut in 1986 has partially\nrecovered in terms of vegetation, which is no longer tropical forest, but agricultural crops in production\nand grasslands for cattle grazing.\n\nAn important concern for deforestation in Brazil is the global effect it produces on climate change.\nIt has long been recognized that rainforests are of vital importance in sequestering carbon dioxide and\nreducing the amount of greenhouse gas being released to the atmosphere. These forests are second\nonly to the oceans as a sink of carbon dioxide. Recent estimates suggest that deforestation in the\nBrazilian Amazon is responsible for as much as 10% of current greenhouse gas emissions. This\nproblem is aggravated by the method generally used to clear the land where the forest is burned to the\nground releasing large amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere These fires frequently burn more\nthan the area intended, and in 1987 between July and October about 19,300 square miles (50,000 km2)\nof rainforest was burned in the states of Para, Mato Grosso, Rondonia, and Acre, releasing more than\n500 million tons of carbon, 44 million tons of carbon monoxide, and millions of tons of nitrogen\noxides, and other poisonous chemicals into the atmosphere.\n\nDeforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon have slowed dramatically since peaking in 2004 at\n27,423 km2 per year. By 2009 deforestation had fallen to around 7000 km2 per year, a decline of 74%\nfrom 2004, according to Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research (INPE), which produces\ndeforestation figures annually. Their deforestation estimates are derived from 100 to 220 images taken\nduring the dry season in the Amazon by the ChinaeBrazil Earth Resources Satellite program\n(CBERS), which may only consider the loss of the Amazon rainforest biome not the loss of natural\nfields of savannah within the rainforest. According to INPE, the original Amazon rainforest biome of\n4,100,000 km2 was reduced to 3,403,000 km2 by 2005 representing a loss of 17.1%. A deforestation\nestimate chart is given here in Fig. 10.6. Note that the double increase for 1994 and 1995 was attributed\nto accidental forest burning rather than to active logging.\n\n706 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\nhttp://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov\n\n\nTable 10.1 Landsat Applications\n\nAgriculture,\nForestry, and Range\nResources Land Use Mapping Geology Hydrology Coastal Resources\n\nEnvironmental\nMonitoring\n\nDiscriminating\nvegetative, crop and\ntimber types\n\nLand uses\nclassification\n\nMapping major\ngeologic features\n\nDetermining water\nboundaries and\nsurface water areas\n\nDetermining patterns\nand extent of\nturbidity\n\nMonitoring\ndeforestation\n\nMeasuring crop and\ntimber acreage\n\nCartographic\nmapping and map\nupdating\n\nRevising geologic\nmaps\n\nMapping floods and\nfloodplain\ncharacteristics\n\nMapping shoreline\nchanges\n\nMonitoring volcanic\nflow activity\n\nPrecision farming\nland management\n\nCategorizing and\ncapabilities\n\nRecognizing and\nclassifying certain\nrock types\n\nDetermining area\nextent of snow and\nice coverage\n\nMapping shoals,\nreefs, and shallow\nareas\n\nMapping and\nmonitoring water\npollution\n\nMonitoring crop and\nforest harvests\n\nMonitoring urban\ngrowth\n\nDelineating\nunconsolidated rocks\nand soils\n\nMeasuring changes\nand extent of glacial\nfeatures\n\nMapping and\nmonitoring sea ice in\nshipping lanes\n\nDetermining effects\nof natural disasters\n\nDetermining range\nreadiness, biomass\nand health\n\nAiding regional\nplanning\n\nMapping volcanic\nsurface deposits\n\nMeasuring turbidity\nand sediment\npatterns\n\nTracking beach\nerosion and flooding\n\nAssessing drought\nimpact\n\nDetermining soil\nconditions and\nassociations\n\nMapping\ntransportation\nnetworks\n\nMapping geologic\nlandforms\n\nDelineating irrigated\nfields\n\nMonitoring coral reef\nhealth\n\nTracking oil spills\n\nMonitoring desert\nblooms\n\nMapping land-water\nboundaries\n\nMineral and\npetroleum resources\n\nMonitoring lake\ninventories and\nhealth\n\nCoastal circulation\npatterns\n\nAssessing and\nmonitoring grass and\nforest fires\n\nAssessing wildlife\nhabitat\n\nCiting transportation\nand power\ntransmission routes\n\nDetermining regional\ngeologic structures\n\nEstimating snowmelt\nand runoff\n\nMeasuring sea\nsurface temperature\n\nMapping and\nmonitoring\neutrophication\n\nCharacterizing forest\nrange vegetation\n\nPlanning solid waste\ndisposal sites, power\nplants, and other\nindustries\n\nProducing\ngeomorphic maps\n\nCharacterizing\ntropical rainfall\n\nMonitoring and\ntracking \u201cred\u201d tides\n\nMonitoring mine\nwaste pollution\n\nMonitoring and\nmapping insect\ninfestations\n\nMapping and\nmanaging floodplains\n\nMapping impact\ncraters\n\nMapping watersheds Coral reef health\nassessment\n\nMonitoring volcanic\nash plumes\n\nContinued\n\n1\n0\n.2\n\nL\nA\nN\nD\nS\nA\nT\nA\nP\nP\nL\nIC\nA\nT\nIO\nN\nS\n\n7\n0\n7\n\n\n\nTable 10.1 Landsat Applicationsdcont\u2019d\n\nAgriculture,\nForestry, and Range\nResources Land Use Mapping Geology Hydrology Coastal Resources\n\nEnvironmental\nMonitoring\n\nMonitoring irrigation\npractices\n\nTracking\nsocioeconomic\nimpacts on land use\n\nPetrochemical\nexploration\n\nMapping closed-\nbasin ponds\n\nGlobal coral reef\nmapping\n\nAssessing carbon\nstocks\n\nBison management Online mapping Mega-lake mapping Monitoring wetlands Coastal restoration Cancer research\n\nCrop production\nestimates\n\nCartographic\ndiscoveries\n\nSoil carbon flux Water management Monitoring coastal\nerosion\n\nAtmospheric\nmodeling\n\nQuantifying burn\nseverity\n\nMapping Wetland restoration Coastal studies Mapping rift valley\nfever risk areas\n\nFighting crop\ninsurance fraud\n\nFighting hunger Monitoring dam\nconstruction\n\nChesapeake Bay\nmanagement\n\nAssessing clear-\ncutting impacts\n\nForest trends in\nMadagascar\n\nUrban sprawl and\nclimate change\n\nGroundwater\ndischarge\n\nAssessing impacts of\nindustrial logging\n\nForest protection in\nPeru\n\nCaribbean island\nmapping\n\nBushfire impact on\nwater yields\n\nMapping urban heat\nislands\n\nBetter estimates of\nboreal forest loss\n\nTropical forest\nclearing for\ndevelopment\n\nLandsat, potholes,\nand climate change\n\nCrop water stress Ancient site\nexploration\n\nDisaster aftermath\n\nCrop water demand Landsat image\nmosaic of Antarctica\n\nAfrican\nenvironmental\nchange\n\nRice production\nmonitoring\n\nKansas mapping Cyclone Nargis\u2019\nimpact on Burma\n\nDemise of Papua\nNew Guinea forests\n\nFire prevention\n\nMonitoring\nconservation tillage\n\nSurveying\nmangroves\n\nNorth American\nforest disturbance\n\nGreek fires\n\nSumatran\ndeforestation\n\nAlgae monitoring\n\nForest damage\ncaused by hurricane\nKatrina\n\nGlacier monitoring\n\nInsect outbreaks\n\n7\n0\n8\n\nC\nH\nA\nP\nT\nE\nR\n1\n0\n\nL\nA\nN\nD\nA\nP\nP\nL\nIC\nA\nT\nIO\nN\nS\n\n\n\nFIGURE 10.5\n\nLandsat false-color infrared images of Rondo?nia, Brazil.

Looking at conditions in the previous September\n(1992; Fig. 10.7, left) normal path of the river can be seen. The image in September 2013, clearly\nshows the flooded areas of basically the same image. While locating floods from these images is easier\nthan mapping them from the ground, the process is a bit trickier than one would imagine. The water in\nthe satellite images is frequently sitting under a forest canopy or is mixed in with the soil. Often the\nflood cannot be clearly seen until you compare the flood image with an image of normal conditions.\n\nIn the flood images the water changes the brightness values since water appears very dark and the\nsurrounding land is relatively bright. Thus, one looks for changes between earlier nonflood conditions\nversus the image showing the flood. This is clearly seen in Fig. 10.7, (right) where the river has\nexceeded its normal bounds and flooded the surrounding areas. From the satellite image alone, it is an\neasy matter to calculate the amount of flooded area. Hence, in the second, or flooded, image the area of\nchange is selected as the area flooded.\n\nThese floodplain maps have been used by many scientists for their applications. The USGS has\nused similar maps to study 1998 floods of the Missouri River on publicly owned conservation lands\nwhere levee breaks have occurred, trying to better understand how to restore the environment of large\nrivers and their floodplains.\n\nSimilar studies have been carried out in other parts of the world such as Pakistan (Hussain et al.,\n2011). However, the use of optical imagery for flood monitoring is limited by severe weather con-\nditions, in particular the presence of clouds. In turn, SAR (synthetic aperture radar) measurements\nfrom space are independent of daylight and weather conditions and can provide valuable information\nto monitoring flood events. This is mainly due to the fact that a smooth water surface provides no\nreturn to the antenna in the microwave part of the spectrum and it therefore appears black in the SAR\n\nFIGURE 10.7\n\nThis pair of Landsat images, combined with elevation data of Rocheport, Missouri, were taken in September\n\n1992 (left) and September 1993 (right). Note the brown and pink regionsdagricultural fieldsdalong the\n\nfloodplain that can be seen in 1992 but are submerged in 1993. Floodplains are often fertile because of the\n\nsediment deposited there by previous floods.\n\nImages by Jesse Allen, GSFC Visualization Analysis Lab,(http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Floods/floods_3.php).\n\n10.2 LANDSAT APPLICATIONS 711\n\nhttp://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Floods/floods_3.php\n\n\nimagery. Flood monitoring using SAR imagery is very accurate (w95%), independent of cloud cover,\nprovides a high revisit time, and easily detects smooth water. However, it also produces false alarms\nfrom shadows, smooth objects such as roads and sand, and it is more difficult to use in urban areas and\nvegetated areas, where usually at least two multitemporal images are required (Kussul et al., 2011).\nFig. 10.8 shows an example of flood mapping using Sentinel-1 data from the European Union\nCopernicus program. Since December 2014, heavy rains affected Malawi (East of Nairobi, Kenia)\n\nFIGURE 10.8\n\nFlood mapping using Sentinel-1 data in Malawi, east of Nairobi, Kenia. SAR images show the changes in\n\nreflectivity since December 2014 (top left), when heavy rains affected Malawi causing rivers to overflow\n\nlater in January 2015 (bottom left). Results for the UN best practices (top right) and Copernicus\n\nEmergency Services (bottom right) are shown, indicating the differences between both approaches\n\n(http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-flood-mapping).\n\n712 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\nhttp://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-flood-mapping\n\n\ncausing rivers to overflow in January 2015. Results using two types of processing are presented: the\nUnited Nations recommended practice (top right) and the Copernius Emergency Service (bottom\nright). SAR data from Sentinel-1 is free of charge. Other SAR imagery may be used, but is not freely\navailable. These include Radarsat-2, TerraSAR-X, and Cosmo-SkyMed.\n\n10.2.3 CARBON STORAGE\nUSGS scientists have used Landsat data to determine that forests, wetlands, and farms in the eastern\nUnited States naturally store 300 million tons of carbon a year, which is nearly 15% of the greenhouse\ngas emissions. EPA estimates the country emits each year or an amount that exceeds and offsets yearly\nUS car emissions. In conjunction with the national assessment, USGS released a new web tool that\nallows users to see the land and water carbon storage and change in their ecosystems between 2005 and\n2050 in the lower 48 states. Biological carbon storagedalso known as carbon sequestrationdis the\nprocess by which carbon dioxide (CO2) is removed from the atmosphere and stored as carbon in\nvegetation, soils, and sediment. The USGS estimates the ability of different ecosystems to store carbon\nnow and in the future, providing vital information for land-use and land-management decisions.\nManagement of carbon stored in our ecosystems and agricultural areas is relevant both for mitigation\nof climate change and for adaptation to such changes.\n\nWhen disasters strike, pre- and post-event imagery can provide critical information regarding the\nextent, severity, and evolution of the event. The USGS Emergency Response supports the coordination\nof remotely sensed data acquisitions and the distribution of images and geospatial information\nproducts to aid in disaster response operations. This activity is based at the USGS EROS Center in\nSioux Falls, South Dakota.\n\nOver the past decade, the USGS has supported the response to hundreds of domestic and international\ndisaster events. TheUSGSprovides access to remotely sensed imagery andgeospatial data sets in response\nto requests from agencies engaged in disaster response. One agency may submit the initial request for\nsupport, but the imagery that becomes available on HDDS can be shared across the response community.\n\n10.2.4 DROUGHT MONITORING AND ITS IMPACT IN FOREST DECLINE\nAND FIRES OCCURRENCE\n\nDrought strikes many regions in the world every year, turning green landscapes brown as precipitation\nfalls below normal levels and water supplies dwindle. Drought is typically a temporary climatic\naberration, but it is also an insidious natural hazard. It might last for weeks, months, or years and may\nhave many negative impacts. Drought can threaten crops, livestock, and livelihoods, stress wildlife and\nhabitats, and increase wildfire risks and threats to human health. Drought conditions can vary\ntremendously from place to place and week to week. Accurate drought monitoring is essential\nto understand a drought\u2019s progression and potential impacts, and to provide information necessary to\nsupport drought mitigation decisions. It is also crucial in light of climate change where droughts could\nbecome more frequent, severe, and persistent.\n\nA team of researchers from the USGS\u2019s EROS Center, the National Drought Mitigation Center,\nand the High Plains Regional Climate Center are developing methods utilizing remote sensing for\nregional-scale mapping and monitoring of drought conditions for the conterminous United States. The\nultimate goal of the project is to deliver timely georeferenced information (in the form of maps and\n\n10.2 LANDSAT APPLICATIONS 713\n\n\n\ndata) about areas where the vegetation is impacted by drought. Research and methods for drought\nmonitoring are developed in tandem with Remote Sensing Phenology.\n\nLandsat 8 is demonstrating promising new capabilities for water quality assessment. Satellite-\nbased instruments allow for more frequent observations over broader areas than physical water\nsampling. Four federal agenciesdNASA, NOAA, EPA, and the USGSdare joining forces to develop\nan early warning system for toxic and nuisance algal blooms. Through this project, satellite data on\nharmful algal blooms will be converted to a format that stakeholders can use through mobile devices\nand web portals. This will improve detection of these blooms and help researchers better understand\nthe conditions under which they occur. The 40-year archive of Landsat data is a valuable resource,\nsupporting many different areas of focus for all users.\n\nMore recently, with the launch in 2009 of the ESA\u2019s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)\nmission, and in 2015 of NASA\u2019s SMAP mission carrying onboard L-band radiometers, the mapping of\nsurface\u2019s soil moisture has been feasible with improved accuracy, despite the poorer spatial resolution\nas compared to other sensors (e.g., optical or SAR). The poorer spatial resolution prevents in-\nvestigators from using microwave radiometry data for regional or local applications. To overcome this\nlimitation, achieving a better spatial resolution, while keeping the good radiometric precision addi-\ntional high quality and high resolution multispectral data can be merged with the radiometry data\n(Piles et al., 2011). Since June 2012, the SMOS Barcelona Expert Center (SMOS-BEC http://cp34-\nbec.cmima.csic.es/) is routinely producing near real time (morning and afternoon passes, if avail-\nable) soil moisture maps of the Iberian peninsula1 at 1 km, from SMOS and MODIS/AQUA and/\nTERRA data (Fig. 10.9), that are used by the regional Catalan authorities as a proxy for forest fires\nprevention during the summer seasons (Chaparro et al., 2016). The data set from 2009 to present has\nalso been used to monitor the role of climatic anomalies and soil moisture in the decline of drought-\nprone forests (Chaparro et al., 2017).\n\nThe applicability of SMOS-derived soil moisture data to the study of climate change impacts is also\npromising. Seven years of data and the availability of high-resolution products (Piles et al., 2014) allow\ndetecting abnormal drought periods involving natural hazards. In that regard, the complementary\napplication of SMOS data and surface temperature information permits to estimate the potential\npropagation of forest fires (Chaparro et al., 2016). Also, the computation of moisture and temperature\nanomalies is crucial in the prediction of regional fire episodes. For instance, more than 200 fires burned\nin the northwestern Iberian Peninsula between end-September and mid-October 2011. This high fire\nactivity period matched with a severe drought in the region, which was detected by negative SMOS\nsoil moisture anomalies (very dry soils), and above normal surface temperatures (Fig. 10.10; Chaparro\net al., 2017).\n\nAdditionally, the increasing number and duration of droughts rise the number of forest\ndecline episodes in the world. The probability of forest decline was modeled in Catalonia as a\nfunction of climate and meteorological variables. In particular, the decline probability of oaks\n(deciduous Quercus) and beeches (Fagus sylvatica) in the region was high under dry soil conditions\noccurring in 2012 (Fig. 10.11; Chaparro et al., 2017). This shows the high potential of soil moisture\ndata to study forest conditions, which are crucial in the context of climate change as forests act as\ncarbon sinks.\n\n1SMOS Barcelona Expert Center on Radiometric Calibration and Ocean Salinity (SMOS-BEC).

Although deadly crashes are rare, a\nbird strike to the windshield can cause visibility issues for pilots, and strikes to jet engines can cause\n\nFIGURE 10.10\n\nAnomalies of soil moisture and land surface temperature prior to fire occurrences in 2011. Both variables\n\nwere calculated at a 30-day time scale. Fires are represented per month, and October is highlighted (high\n\nnumber of fires).\n\nFIGURE 10.9\n\n(A) 1 km down-scaled soil moisture map of the Iberian Peninsula generated from the combination of soil\n\nmoisture and ocean salinity and MODIS/AQUA and/TERRA data, (B) zoom over the Ebro river valley, and\n\n(C) zoom over the Pyrenees. In (B) the cultivated regions near the river and its tributaries are clearly wetter\n\nthan the rest. In (C) the north side of the mountains is clearly wetter than the south side, which is drier.\n\n10.2 LANDSAT APPLICATIONS 715\n\n\n\nengine failure. Flocks of birds are particularly dangerous, with the threat of multiple strikes at the same\ntime to the same aircraft. Flocks of formerly endangered Aleutian cackling geese enjoy the sum-\nmertime in the Near Islands at the far western end of Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands, which is also home to\nEareckson Air Station. The air station is located on Shemya Island, the only island in the group where\nArctic foxes have been allowed to remain. The foxes ensure that the geese are not present on Shemya\nduring the nesting and molting seasons of mid-summer. However, flocks of geese arrive in the spring as\ngrasses grow early in the season abundant with nutrients. As they prepare to migrate south in the fall,\nthe geese move to shrubby areas loaded with berries and to vegetation that greened up late in the\nsummer, where they can eat well before their journey.\n\nThe increasing goose population in recent years has elevated the risk for bird strikes at Eareckson\nAir Station. The Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (BASH) prevention program was implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense to provide the safest flying conditions possible. While you cannot see the birds\nfrom space, Matthew Macander and Christopher Swingley of ABR, Inc. Environmental Research &\nServices mapped the presence or absence of snow and spatialetemporal dynamics of the grassy and\nshrubby habitats in the Near Islands with Landsat satellite images. Based on the resulting maps, an\nABR team visited the islands in spring 2008 and fall 2009 and conducted a habitat-use analysis by\ncounting current-season scat. Back in the office, they mapped where the geese spent time in the spring\nand fall, and compared the scat counts with the Landsat images. They determined that there was a key\n10-day period needed for BASH mitigation in spring. After their arrival, the geese rapidly moved on as\nsnowmelt proceeded on other islands in the Aleutian chain. The ABR team additionally recommended\nmitigation strategies that include habitat modification such as vegetation removal or the types of seeds\nto avoid when revegetation is necessary due to disturbance.\n\nThe mapping of habitat with Landsat is hardly a unique application of the data; however, the\ninformation gained from the mapping of preferred geese habitat in this very remote region, as well as\nfield surveys, enables new and valuable applied information on BASH mitigation. This knowledge can\nreduce costs of aircraft repair from multiple strikes and could save the lives of military personnel.\n\nFIGURE 10.11\n\nEstimated effect of soil moisture (SMOS, in m3/m3) on the decline of probability for oaks (deciduous Quercus)\n\nand beeches (Fagus sylvatica). Dashed lines show 95% confidence intervals. In both species, the effects\n\nwere highly significant (P < .01). The effect in Fagus sylvatica was extrapolated for values of soil moisture\n\nbelow 0.11 m3/m3.\n\n716 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nA Landsat 7 ETM\u00fe image displaying Shemya Island with Eareckson Air Station, acquired October 8,\n2003, is presented in Fig. 10.12.\n\n10.2.6 LANDSAT ADDS TREMENDOUS VALUE TO DECISION MAKING\nDr. Stephanie Hulina, President of Geospatial Data Analysis Corporation (GDA Corp), discusses how\naccess to free Landsat imagery from USGS enables her business to provide value-added products to\nher company\u2019s clients. The long-term continuity of the Landsat mission is essential to her company\u2019s\nability to maintain a competitive edge in today\u2019s global economy. Access to readily available Landsat\nimagery has helped GDA to expand rapidly and serve agricultural, environmental, and resource\nmanagement clients, some of whom were previously unaware of the tremendous value that Landsat\ndata and their analysis can bring to their decision-making and ultimately their bottom line. It turns out\nthat GDA is the second largest commercial downloader of Landsat imagery from the USGS world-\nwide. Not bad for a small business that formed in 2004 from a NASA Small Business Innovation\nResearch (SBIR) project on developing a fully automated procedure for identifying clouds and their\nshadows in Landsat-class imagery (http://www.gdacorp.com/casa/).\n\nFrom that one project, GDA has branched out to develop a handful of image-processing techniques\nfor a range of commercial and government satellites and serves a multitude of clients across the globe.\nLandsat, however, is the sensor that GDA turns to repeatedly to solve client problems, either at a\nclient\u2019s request or by suggestion from GDA. Dr. Hulina notes, \u201cLandsat imagery is the workhorse\nsensor at GDA. Its 30 m resolution, large number of multispectral bands that include NIR and MIR\ndata, its long historical record, along with excellent sensor calibration provides the absolute best bang\nfor the buck compared to all other sensors currently out there for fine level monitoring of local and\n\nFIGURE 10.12\n\nLandsat 7 ETM\u00fe image displaying Shemya Island October 8, 2003.\n\n10.2 LANDSAT APPLICATIONS 717\n\nhttp://www.gdacorp.com/casa/\n\n\nglobal land cover and land cover change.\u201d GDA client interests range from detection of data gaps in the\nimagery, image calibration to surface reflectance, and image mosaicking to full-blown image analysis\nto answer questions like when, where, and how much of a particular crop is planted in a particular\nregion for any given year.\n\nLandsat imagery is exceptionally well suited for agricultural analysis up to the field level. GDA is\nespecially proud of their long-standing working relationship with the Foreign Agricultural Service\n(FAS) of the USDA. Working with the Office of Global Analysis/International Production Assessment\nDivision within FAS, GDA has used its technology alongside the expertise of the USDA/FAS to\nprovide timely and accurate global crop intelligence while consistently covering all major agricultural\nregions annually. GDA analysis of Landsat imagery and the final products generated from it factor into\nthe global production forecasts that FAS releases every month.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations uses a combination of satellite\nremote sensing and a geographic information system (GIS) to aid in planning for the management of\nrenewable resources in agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. One important application is concerned with\nland cover mapping and land management. The resulting land cover maps are necessary tools for\nmanagement of any region. One important thing to remember is that land cover uses change with\nvariations in human activity and natural disasters so it is important that these conditions can be easily\nupdated. This is where the combination of satellite remote sensing and GIS come in as together they\ncan provide a very current estimate of the present land cover uses.\n\n10.3 LAND COVER MAPPING\nLand cover maps need to be large enough to provide the information needed in the region of interest.\nAt the same time they need to have a good enough resolution to be able to see the features of interest. It\nhas been found that a map scale of 1:50,000 scale is ideal for this application. For optimal use these\nmaps should be digital, which makes it easy to update and redisplay the land use maps. Combined with\nupdated GIS information for the same area the results are a digital database, which describes the area\nand the relevant land surface uses.\n\nThe methodological approach is presented here in Fig. 10.13, which is a flow chart of the different\nelements involved in the mapping of land use. Inputs are the original satellite or aerial image, which\nhas to be processed to calibrate the radiance reaching the sensor and to geometrically correct the image\nto fit a selected geographic map projection. Then, the ground truth information from the GIS is added\nto this mapped image. The result is an image of the land cover from the Land Cover and Classification\nSystem (LCCS). At this point new features are added to the land cover database and the GIS database.\n\nSatellite imagery from Meteosat, NOAA AVHRR, Landsat, SPOT, ERS-SAR, WorldView 1-3,\nIkonos, and from aerial photographs are used as inputs for this system. The GIS system combines all\nthe ground measurement data from the area of interest to produce accurate overlays of ground truth\ninformation for the image in question. Information such as topography, water availability, soil type,\nforests and grasslands, climate, geology, population, landownership, highways, railway, electricity\nsystems, and communication systems. There are many advantages of using satellite data for this\napplication: they provide synoptic coverage, they can be acquired over an area at a high rate of\nrepetition, usually provides information in a variety of wavelengths, and they can be collected for any\npart of the world.\n\n718 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nAs an example FAO carried out a study of vineyards in Bulgaria in August of 2000. They used\nLandsat TM and Ikonos satellite imagery for this study. Image classification was carried out using the\nFAO LCCS, which is a comprehensive, standardized system created for mapping images of this type.\nThe classification uses a set of independent diagnostics to find correlations with features in the new\nimages. This system could serve as an internationally agreed reference database for land cover. The\nmethodology could be used anywhere in the world.\n\nThis analysis produced 14 land cover maps at a 1:50,000 scale covering a total area of 5600 km2.\nThe resulting map includes the 49 land cover classes, which were identified for the study area. This\nanalysis was tested by a similar analysis of part of the study region using a much higher spatial\nresolution optical satellite. The 1 m resolution (pan-sharpened imager) of the IKONOS satellite makes\nit possible to map land features with a scale of 1:5000, a marked improvement over the earlier analysis.\nThis study only looked at vineyards in the Sandanski region. The results are summarized here in\nFig. 10.14. From this image it was possible to identify existing, but active vineyard, abandoned\nvineyard, and regions where the vineyard had been destroyed.\n\nFIGURE 10.13\n\nFAO land cover mapping approach.\n\nFrom http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y3642E/Y3642E00.HTM.\n\n10.3 LAND COVER MAPPING 719\n\nhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y3642E/Y3642E00.HTM\n\n\nThe conclusion of this study was that satellite remote sensing coupled with the LCCS analysis\nsystem provides an accurate, flexible, and cost-effective method to map land cover. This information is\nbest merged with ground data from a GIS system and the new information is used to further update and\nimprove the GIS system.\n\n10.4 COMMERCIAL HIGH-RESOLUTION OPTICAL IMAGERY\n10.4.1 SATELLITE POUR L\u2019OBSERVATION DE LA TERRE\nThe Satellite Pour l\u2019Observation de la Terre (SPOT) was one of the first commercial high-resolution\noptical Earth observing satellites. It is operated by SPOT Image, based in Toulouse, France. It was\ninitiated by the French Space Agency (Center National d\u2019E?tudes Spatiales, CNES) in the 1970s and\nwas developed in conjunction with SSTC (Belgian scientific, technical, and cultural services) and the\nSwedish National Space Board (SNSB). It was designed to improve the knowledge and management\nof the Earth\u2019s resources, detecting and forecasting phenomena in the areas of climatology, oceanog-\nraphy, and monitoring human activities and natural phenomena.\n\nN\n\nLEGEND\n\nAbandoned vineyard\n\nType\n\nOld vineyards\nAbandoned vineyards\nRemoved vineyards\nTotal\n\nArea /ha/ Percent/%/\n\nOld vineyard\n\nRemoved vineyard\n\nOther area\n\n68,12\n33,26\n2,92\n\n104,30\n\n65,31\n31,89\n\n2,80\n100,00\n\n3%\nOld vineyards\n\nAbandoned\nvineyards\n\nRemoved\nvineyards\n\n32%\n\n65%\n\nFIGURE 10.14\n\nAn example of a land cover map at a 1:5000 scale.\n\nFrom http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y3642E/Y3642E00.HTM.\n\n720 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\nhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/004/Y3642E/Y3642E00.HTM\n\n\nThe SPOT series of satellites are given as follows:\n\n1. SPOT 1 was launched on February 22, 1986, with a 10 m panchromatic and a 20 m multispectral\nimage resolution capability. Its mission was terminated on December 31, 1990.\n\n2. SPOT 2 was launched on January 22, 1990, with similar capabilities. It was deorbited on\nJuly 1, 2009.\n\n3. SPOT 3 was launched on September 26, 1993, with similar capabilities. It ceased to operate on\nNovember 14, 1997.\n\n4. SPOT 4 was launched on March 24, 1998, with similar capabilities and stopped functioning on\nJanuary 11, 2013.\n\n5. SPOT 5 (Fig. 10.15) was launched on May 4, 2002, with a nominally 5 m panchromatic\nresolution that could be operated in \u201csupermode\u201d with a 2.5 m resolution. The multispectral\nresolution improved to 10 m while the short wave infrared channel had a 20 m spatial resolution\n(Fig. 10.16). It stopped functioning on March 27, 2015\n\n6. SPOT 6 (Fig. 10.17) was launched on September 9, 2012, and is still operating.\n7. SPOT 7 was launched on June 30, 2014, and is still operating.\n\nThe SPOT orbit is polar, circular, sun-synchronous, and phased. The inclination of the orbital plane\ncombined with the Earth\u2019s rotation makes it possible for a single SPOT satellite to fly over any point on\nthe surface of the Earth every 26 days. The orbital altitude is 832 km and the inclination is 98.7 degrees\nresulting in the satellite completing 14 \u00fe 5/26 orbital revolutions per day. In its present configuration the\nSPOT constellation of two satellites makes it possible to acquire imagery from anywhere in the world\nevery day. These two satellites are SPOT 4 and 5 and have identical high-resolution optical imaging\n\nFIGURE 10.15\n\nIllustration of the deployed SPOT-5 spacecraft.\n\nImage credit: CNES. https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/spot-5\n\n10.4 COMMERCIAL HIGH-RESOLUTION OPTICAL IMAGERY 721\n\nhttps://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/spot-5\n\n\nFIGURE 10.16\n\nAthens as seen by SPOT 5 in 2002.\n\nFIGURE 10.17\n\nA comparison between the 2.5 m resolution of SPOT 5 (left) and the 1.5 m resolution of SPOT 6 (right).\n\n722 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\ninstruments, which can operate in the panchromatic band (P mode) or in a multispectral mode (xs). The\norientation of each instrument\u2019s strip-selection mirror can be remotely steered by the ground station,\noffering oblique views with angles of ?27 degrees from the satellite\u2019s vertical axis. Using this capability\nthe sampling interval can be shortened from 26 to 4e5 days in the temperature zones. SPOT 5 also carries\nthe high-resolution stereoscopic (HRS) imaging instrument for the acquisition of optical stereo image\npairs to compute digital elevation maps of the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nThe continuity of the SPOT program is planned with the development of the Ple?iades system, as\nwell as SPOT 6 and 7. The latter offers 1.5 m spatial resolution images in a 60 ? 60 km swath.\nA comparison between SPOT 5 and SPOT 6 is presented here in Fig. 10.17.\n\nThe advantage of this higher spatial resolution is readily obvious in Fig. 10.17 where one can now\nsee expanded views of areas that are quite restricted in the lower resolution image. Features appear on\nthe right that are impossible to see in the lower resolution image on the left.\n\nOne of the big changes with SPOT 5 (Fig. 10.15) was the addition of the HRS instrument, which\nwas designed to take simultaneous stereo-pairs of a swath of 120 km across and 600 km long with\nground resolutions of 10 ? 10 m in the panchromatic and multispectral modes. This satellite has two\nhigh-resolution geometrical instruments that were derived from the HRVIR instrument that flew on\nSPOT 4. They have a spatial resolution of 2.5e5 m in panchromatic modes and 10 m in the multi-\nspectral mode. In addition the instrument has a 20 m horizontal resolution in the near infrared\n(1.58e1.75 mm). The HRS operates in the panchromatic mode and points both forward and backward\nof the satellite in creating the parallax views for stereo viewing and digital elevation computations.\nThis rapid pointing capability made it possible to produce nearly coincident images of the same piece\nof ground very closely spaced in time.\n\nFor the high resolution geometric sensor the panchromatic bands had a native spatial resolution of\n5 ? 5 m or a supermode of 2.5 ? 2.5 m. SPOT 6 (Fig. 10.18) satellite was built by AIRBUS Defense\n\nFIGURE 10.18\n\nSPOT 6.\n\nImage courtesy of AIRBUS Defense and Space.\n\n10.4 COMMERCIAL HIGH-RESOLUTION OPTICAL IMAGERY 723\n\n\n\nand Space and was successfully launched on September 9, 2012 from the Satish Dhawan Space Center\nin India. On June 30, 2014, it was joined by SPOT 7.\n\nThe main changes in the SPOT 6, 7 instruments was an improvement to a multispectral resolution\nof 6.0 m and a panchromatic resolution of 1.5 m over a swath of 60 km at nadir. This instrument has\nthe capability to collect imagery in a 120 km ? 120 km bistrip or a 60 km ? 180 km tristrip mapping\nin a single pass or the delivery of mosaic stereo and tristereo acquisitions of 60 ? 60 km scenes for the\nproduction of digital elevation models. There are six different tasking plans and each takes 24 h. Up to\n750 scenes are collected per day per satellite.\n\nAt the time of launch both SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 belonged to SPOT Image, a subsidiary of Astrium\nwho funded the satellites and the launch. In December 2014 SPOT 7 was sold to Azerbaijan\u2019s space\nagency Azercosmos, who renamed it Azersky. The architecture is similar to that of other Ple?iades\nsatellites as depicted in Fig. 10.18. SPOT 6 and SPOT 7 are in the same orbit as Ple?iades 1A and\nPleiades 1B at an altitude of 694 km forming a constellation 90 degrees apart from each other.\n\nThe image product resolutions are as follows: 1.5 m in the panchromatic, 1.5 m in the color-merged\n(pansharpened), and 6 m in the multispectral. The spectral bands are as follows: panchromatic\n(450e745 nm), blue (450e5235 nm), green (530e590 nm), red (625e695 nm), and the near-infrared\n(760e890 nm). The image size on the ground is 60 km ? 60 km, and the satellite has the capacity to\nacquire up to 3 million km2 daily.\n\n10.4.2 DIGITALGLOBE INC.\nIn the early 1990, a new era of commercial remote sensing was born with the object of flying high-\nresolution optical sensors to provide satellite imagery to the world for domestic and military ap-\nplications. While initially there were a number of these companies today DigitalGlobe Inc. remains\nas the largest and most active while the others either folded or were merged with DigitalGlobe.\nOriginally formed as the WorldView Imaging Corp in January 1992 the intention was to take\nadvantage of the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act (enacted in October 1992) to establish a\ncommercial company to provide high-resolution land satellite imagery. Its founder was Dr. Walter\nScott and the company received the first high-resolution commercial remote sensing license issued\nunder the 1992 Act. At the time Dr. Scott was the head of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratories\n\u201cBrilliant Pebbles\u201d and \u201cBrilliant Eyes\u201d projects, which were part of the then Strategic Defense\nInitiative. He was joined by Doug Gerull who was then the executive in charge of the Mapping\nScience division of Intergraph Corp. The company\u2019s first remote sensing license from the United\nStates Department of Commerce allowed it to build a commercial satellite capable of collecting\nimages with a 3 m spatial resolution.\n\nIn 1995, the company became EarthWatch Inc. merging WorldView with Ball Aerospace and\nTechnologies Corp\u2019s commercial remote sensing operations. The first satellite launched for Earth-\nWatch was EarlyBird 1 on December 24, 1997. It was launched from the Svobodny Cosmodrome by a\nStart-1 rocket. The satellite carried a panchromatic camera with a 3 m resolution and a multispectral\ncamera with a 15 m resolution (Fig. 10.19). This satellite was built by CTA Space Systems (now part of\nOrbital Sciences Corp.). EarlyBird 1 was the first commercial satellite to be launched from the\nSvobodny Cosmodrome. EarthWatch announced that all contact was lost with EarlyBird 1 on\nDecember 28, 1997.\n\n724 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nFollowing the failure of EarlyBird 1 the new EarthWatch merge with Ball Aerospace became\nDigitalGlobe, and a new satellite QuickBird was built by Ball with a sensor built by ITT in Fort Wayne,\nIndiana. QuickBird was launched by a Delta-II launch vehicle on October 18, 2001, into a?98 degrees\nSun-synchronous orbit. This followed an earlier launch effort that resulted in the loss of QuickBird-1.\nOn orbit, the new QuickBird satellite provided a panchromatic band with a 60 cm spatial resolution\nand multispectral scanning with a 2.4 m resolution. QuickBird operated successfully until January 27,\n2015, when it was deorbited, exceeding its initial design life by nearly 300%.\n\nWhile QuickBird was still flying DigitalGlobe embarked on a new series of satellites that used the\noldWorldView name. WorldView-1 (WV-1) was again built by Ball Aerospace with a sensor from ITT.\nIt was launched again on a Delta-II rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base on September 18, 2007.\nUnlike QuickBird WV-1 was panchromatic only with a 50 cm spatial resolution. It was quickly\nfollowed by WorldView-2 launched on October 8, 2009, but this time the sensor had both the 50 cm\npanchromatic band from 450 to 800 nm, and an eight channel multispectral capability providing data\nin red, blue, green, yellow, red-edge, two near IR bands, and a coastal band.\n\nThe latest in the WorldView series is WV-3 (Fig. 10.20) that improves the panchromatic sensing to\na 31 cm resolution, extends the multispectral sensing to bands that cover both the visible and near\ninfrared with 12 bands having a 1.24 m resolution. There are also eight short-wave infrared bands\n(w3.7 mm) that can be used to sense and map wildfires. A new instrument called CAVIS is added to\nprovide improved atmospheric correction for the imagery. All of the WorldView satellites are very\nagile meaning that they can be rapidly repointed to cover a region of interest. This increases\nDigitalGlobe\u2019s ability to cover one region from repeated passes.\n\nA big change came in 2010 when it was announced that DigitalGlobe would merge with its\ncompetition the GeoEye Corp. This merger was completed on January 31, 2013, which joined the\nUnited States\u2019s only commercial satellite providers. The new company continues under the name\nDigitalGlobe, but now the satellite assets are operated by DigitalGlobe. Thus, the new DigitalGlobe\nsatellite constellation consists of six operating satellites. The presently operating satellites are\nWorldView-1, WorldView-2, GeoEye-1, IKONOS, WorldView-3, and WorldView-4 launched on\nNovember 11, 2016. Both IKONOS and GeoEye-1 are assets taken over by DigitalGlobe in the\n\nFIGURE 10.19\n\nEarlyBird 1 satellite.\n\n10.4 COMMERCIAL HIGH-RESOLUTION OPTICAL IMAGERY 725\n\n\n\nmerger with GeoEye. Built by General Dynamics GeoEye-1 provides panchromatic imagery with a\n41 cm resolution and multispectral with a 1.65 m resolution. A product of Lockheed Martin Corp the\nIKONOS satellite was operated by the Space Imaging Corp. which later became GeoEye. IKONOS\nhad an 80 cm panchromatic band, and four multispectral bands with a 4 m resolution.\n\n10.4.2.1 Applications of High-Resolution Satellite Imagery\n10.4.2.1.1 DigitalGlobe Imagery Use for Changchun Urban Planning Initiative\nChangchun is at the center of China\u2019s automobile manufacturing industry and has also become an\nimportant center for biopharmaceutical, and other high technology activities. As such it is one of the\nfastest growing metropolises in northeast China. The Changchun Surveying and Mapping Institute\n(CSMI) was charged with keeping the municipality\u2019s database current, and they rely on high-\nresolution imagery from DigitalGlobe for this process. This municipality covers a total area or\nmore than 20,000 km2 including a wide variety of landscapes ranging from its urban core to rural\nmountainous areas with more than 200 rivers and lakes. Changchun has also been designated as one of\nfour National Garden Cities in China an award made by the Chinese Ministry of Construction to reflect\nthe city\u2019s high rate of \u201cgreening\u201d of the city.\n\n10.4.2.1.2 DigitalGlobe Satellite Imagery Helps Agricultural Development\nin the Philippines\n\nAgriculture, livestock, and fishing employs more than 40% of the Philippines\u2019 98 million inhabitants\nand represents 20% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). The Department of Agriculture\n\nFIGURE 10.20\n\nWorldView-3 satellite (http://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/worldview-3/).\n\n726 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\nhttp://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/worldview-3/\n\n\nwishes to empower the farming and fishing communities to produce accessible and affordable food for\nevery habitant and to provide a sufficient level of income for everyone involved in the industry. As a\nconsequence this department is constantly seeking out new methods to improve its goods and services\nto its customers.\n\nThis department recognized that precise spatial information would provide a wealth of beneficial\ninformation to both identify vulnerabilities and to improve productivity says Josephine Minerva,\nexecutive vice president and chief operating officer for DigitalGlobe\u2019s information partner\nGeo-Surveys & Mapping (GSMI) Inc. They had been using SPOT imagery that was incomplete, out of\ndate, and not of a very high spatial resolution. Established in 1994, GSMI is a pioneer in providing top-\nof-the-line geomatic solutions for surveying, mapping, remote sensing, GIS, and systems integration in\nthe Philippines. GSMI houses a full line of sophisticated equipment for data acquisition, image\nprocessing, and mapping of satellite and other in situ geographic data.\n\nIn the fall of 2012 GSMI began delivery of GeoEye 1 and WV-2 imagery for both coastal and\nterrestrial areas. The project will eventually cover the entire Archipelago spanning an area of more\nthan 300,000 square miles consisting of 7107 islands with more than 22,000 miles of coastline. \u201cWe\nare working very closely with the Department to help us prioritize and determine the applications of\nthis technology,\u201d states DigitalGlobe. Using DigitalGlobe imagery they were able to offer the most\ncompetitive bid and satisfy their technical criteria. DigitalGlobe wants to ensure that they maximize\ntheir resources and develop applications of the data that will provide measureable benefits.\n\nThe Department considers the satellite imagery as the basis for improving the delivery of services\nwith the establishment of a database for existing agriculture and fishery resources. With an extensive\nlibrary of historic imagery the Department will have the ability to measure changes in the environment\nover time. The Department will have a true benchmark of change to make better informed decisions\nmoving forward. At the same time the Department wishes for GSMI to optimize their investment in\nDigitalGlobe imagery.\n\n10.4.2.1.3 City of Solvang, California\nEvery spring across the US potholes and other road damage result from drastic changes in\ntemperature and regular road wear. Decades of spending on new road construction, instead of regular\nroad repair, has left many states\u2019 roads in poor condition and in dire need of repair. To best deploy\nresources to repair the roads a method to quickly and easily survey road conditions is needed. At\npresent most of the repair work is reactive in nature and waits for complaints to come in before repair\ncrews are sent to repair road damage. In the city of Solvang, CA, the Department of Public Works uses\nDigitalGlobe imagery (Fig. 10.21) to quickly locate road damage and mobilize repair crews to rapidly\nrepair and keep all roads travel ready.\n\nFIGURE 10.21\n\nAerial photograph of damaged roads in Solvang, California.\n\n10.4 COMMERCIAL HIGH-RESOLUTION OPTICAL IMAGERY 727\n\n\n\nThe city of Solvang is a Danish replica village in California that is a major tourist attraction with\nwindmills, horse ranches, and wineries. As such there are lots of automobile traffic mixed in with\nhorse-and-buggy traffic in the town. In such a setting road damage can be a major distraction. The\nPublic Works Department decided to use ortho-rectified aerial imagery provided by DigitalGlobe to\nassess the road damage in need of repair. These images were used in the deployment of road repaving\ncrews to the areas in greatest need of repair as seen in the aerial images. Thus, the remote sensing\nimagery greatly reduced the cost of gaining information about the condition of the city\u2019s roads and\nmade it possible to optimize the deployment of costly resources to repave the roads. The success in\nSolvang has now spread to other cities, which are also using high-resolution imagery to map road\nconditions in their areas.\n\nOther related uses of high-resolution imagery for cities area:\n\n1. Fire protection: Locate hydrants where they have the greatest access to buildings before a fire\noccurs.\n\n2. Accidents: Identify stationary reference points, measure intersections, and evaluate preimpact\nand postimpacts conditions.\n\n3. Code enforcement: Match permits, permit applications, and complaints to imagery to verify or\ndetermine violations.\n\n4. Inventory: Quickly survey infrastructure objects from road markings and building to manholes\nand fire hydrants.\n\n5. Purchasing: Determine quantities of material needed in a given area (concrete, equipment,\nmanholes, hydrants, parking meters, etc.), and calculate the associated cost.\n\n6. Parades and other events: Establish traffic control and station route marshals, sheriffs, and\nportable toilets.\n\n10.4.2.1.4 Using DigitalGlobe Imagery for Planning Moscow\u2019s Green Space\nAs Europe\u2019s largest city and the world\u2019s sixth largest metropolis with 12 million people, Moscow is\nalso one of the world\u2019s greenest cities. In addition to the landmark Gorky Park, Moscow is the home to\nnearly 100 additionally significant parks, numerous botanical gardens, 450 km2 of green zones, and\n100 km2 of forest. Green space planning and monitoring has become a priority for city government as\nMoscow continues to grow.\n\nWith the arrival of a free market economy in the early 1990s, Moscow became one of the world\u2019s\nfastest growing cities. Western structures such as new office towers, roadways, and retail centers along\nwith thousands of housing units quickly sprung up. Realizing the need to preserve its heritage, the city\nset out to create a vegetation geodatabase as a reference for future urban planning. \u201cThe city had no\nclear methodology to track the health and locations of its vegetation,\u201d says Olga Kolesnikova, head of\nthe complex project department for DigitalGlobe\u2019s partner Sovzond JSC. \u201cWith all the building project\nand new roadways, the city sought a solution to help protect existing vegetation as well as identify\nopportunities to add new environmentally protected spaces.\u201d\n\nUsing DigitalGlobe\u2019s multispectral 8-band high-resolution satellite imagery Sovzond vectorized\nnearly 400,000 polygons throughout the city for the years 2009e11 (Fig. 10.22), about half related to\ngrass and vegetation, the remainder to trees and shrubs. They developed methods to discriminate\nbetween grassy vegetation and trees/shrubs based on this high-resolution satellite data. They began\nusing a small test area in the central and northeastern administrative districts of the city and later\nreplicated this approach citywide.\n\n728 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nUsing indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to detect live green\nvegetation, Sovzond was able to create a rating system to measure vegetative health. This vector layer\nof vegetation cover ranged from perfect to unsatisfactory making it possible to rank the various parts of\nthe city. This greatly aided the urban planners and other city officials in their decisions about pres-\nervation and planning.\n\nThe completion of the city\u2019s first vegetative database is only the beginning for Moscow city\nplanners. The availability of DigitalGlobe\u2019s archival imagery combined with the new imagery\ncollected for Moscow gives city officials a \u201cliving\u201d vegetative map from which to compare how the\ncity is managing its green space, while having an accurate and current database to use for future\nplanning decisions.\n\n10.4.2.1.5 Satellite Imagery Vital to Proactive Forestry Management\nForestry industry in Sweden accounts for 3% of the GDP and 12% of its exports. The forestry industry\nplays an important role in the economy of Sweden. Recently bark beetles, which had been in Central\nEurope for centuries, have started to make inroads into Sweden where normally the long cold winters\nkept them out. Now with warm winds and increasing global temperatures the bark beetles are starting\nto appear in the forests of Sweden. It is important to monitor the changes in Sweden\u2019s forests to be able\nto assess the damage caused by these beetles. High-resolution satellite imagery has proven to be an\neffective tool in monitoring the health of Sweden\u2019s vast forests (Fig. 10.23).\n\nSweden has a lot at stake in protecting their forests. It is the world\u2019s third largest exporter of paper\nand the second largest exporter of sawn timber. It is important to realize that bark beetles do not attack\nhealthy trees, but prefer sick and dying trees. Thus, an indicator of tree health is critical to managing\nforest resources. To minimize the spread of bark beetles, it is necessary to identify the sick trees and\nremove them from the forest before they can be infested with bark beetles. Satellite imagery provides a\ntremendous advantage, both technically and economically, in helping to locate those trees most\nvulnerable to attack by bark beetles. These are the conclusions of Nils Erik Jorgensen, the chief\ntechnical officer and owner of TerraNor DigitalGlobe\u2019s alliance partner in Sweden. Founded in 1989\nTerraNor is a software and consulting company working with GIS and remote sensing for applications\nin forestry, oil, agriculture, education, and research.\n\nIn 2011 TerraNor carried out a project to identify trees that had been attacked by bark beetles in\nthe O?terlund and Sundsvall regions of northern Sweden. The DigitalGlobe satellite GeoEye-1\ncollected data over a 4-week period in July and August. With a 50 cm spatial resolution they\nwere able to detect numerous species such as pine and spruce and determine the health of these trees.\nOnce the poor trees are identified, on the basis of the satellite imagery, loggers go into the forest and\n\nFIGURE 10.22\n\n8-Band satellite image of part of Moscow.\n\n10.4 COMMERCIAL HIGH-RESOLUTION OPTICAL IMAGERY 729\n\n\n\nspecifically remove the dead and dying trees to create borders around healthy trees to the hinder the\nspread of the bark beetles.\n\nIn addition to the bark beetle infestation study, DigitalGlobe satellite data were used in the middle\nof Norway and Sweden to identify areas with high concentrations of downed trees due to high wind\nspeed. In January 2014, WorldView-2 panchromatic images (50 cm resolution) were used to survey a\n1600 km2 area to identify regions with high concentrations of downed trees. Quickly removing these\ndowned trees is again critical to hindering the spread of the bark beetles. It is important to recognize\nthat the weather conditions during these high wind events were such that ground operations were\nlimited making the satellite information even more important.\n\n10.5 FOREST FIRE DETECTION AND MAPPING\nSatellite remote sensing provides a very valuable tool for the detection and monitoring of wildfires\nand the management of forests to prevent these wildfires. It is also an effective tool to map the\ndamage caused by such a fire event. The primary advantages of satellite-based sensing are as follows:\n(1) its large area and synoptic coverage, (2) its frequent and repetitive coverage of an area of interest,\n(3) its ability to make quantitative measurements of ground features using radiometrically calibrated\nsensors, (4) the ability to do semiautomated computerized processing and analysis, and (5) the\nrelatively low-cost per unit area of coverage. Ground and airborne surveys are much more manpower\nintensive and hence considerably more expensive (https://crisp.nus.edu.sg/wresearch/forest_fire/\nforest_fire.htm).\n\nAt present a number of operational satellite systems are being used in forest fire detection, monitoring,\nand assessment. Each of these satellite platforms carries sensors with slightly different characteristics in\n\nFIGURE 10.23\n\nNear-infrared satellite image from WV-2 showing healthy (green) and sickly (purple) trees.\n\n730 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\nhttps://crisp.nus.edu.sg/%7Eresearch/forest_fire/forest_fire.htm\nhttps://crisp.nus.edu.sg/%7Eresearch/forest_fire/forest_fire.htm\nhttps://crisp.nus.edu.sg/%7Eresearch/forest_fire/forest_fire.htm\n\n\nterms of wavelengths, resolutions, and radiometric fidelity. One of the oldest is the NOAAAVHRR sensor\ncarried on the polar-orbiting weather satellites since the early 1980s. With a wide band visible channel\ncentered in the red, a near infrared channel, a mid-range infrared channel, and two-thermal channels, the\nAVHRR is effective at mapping the smoke plumes from a wildfire and when the wind blows off the hot\nspot it can detect the thermal emissions from the first itself. The two thermal channels at 11 and 12 mm are\ntoo sensitive to Earth-emitted radiation and will saturate in the presence of a hot spot. The mid-range\ninfrared channel, however, will respond to emissions from much higher temperatures. One must be\ncareful, however, since this mid-range infrared channel also contains reflected radiation, so it is best to use\nit to sense the fire hot spots during the night when there is no reflected radiation. Depending on the satellite\nconfiguration, this instrument covers a spot on the Earth 2e4 times per day.\n\nThe DMSP-OLS instrument has a low-light capability that can be used at night to sense visible light\nemissions from fires at night. This unique capability is unfortunately compromised by a relatively low\nspatial resolution of 2.7 km. Again, depending on the number of satellites operating the coverage is\napproximately daily.\n\n10.5.1 MODIS FIRE PRODUCTS\nThe MODIS instrument flying on NASA Terra (morning) and AQUA (afternoon) satellites has 36\nbands ranging from the visible through the thermal infrared. It has two 250 m bands and five 500 m\nbands in the visible that can be used to more precisely locate the smoke plumes from the wildfires. The\nnear-infrared, the mid-range infrared, and the thermal infrared channels all have the usual 1 km spatial\nresolution. This instrument has proven to be a very useful means of mapping wildfires.\n\nThere is a series of MODIS fire products as clearly discussed and described by Justice et al. (2002).\nAt the time of this book, MODIS was producing the only current global daily active fire product. At\nthat time data were also available from ASTER a high-resolution multispectrometer flying on the\nTERRA satellite. ASTER provided high spatial resolution thermal infrared imagery which was very\nuseful in viewing fire hot spots and supplied a MODIS fire product validation source. In the paper by\nJustice et al. (2002) they discuss a specific fire validation study conducted in Africa. They also\nintroduce a prototype MODIS burned area product, again with an example from Africa that was used\nto model pyrogenic emissions. They also discuss a MODIS Fire Rapid Response System and a web-\nbased online image distribution system. As reported by Justice et al. (2002) the MODIS Fire Team\ndeveloped and tested two types of fire products: active fire products to give location of active fires and a\nburned area product which gave the extent of burn scars over a specific time period. The active fire\nalgorithm uses multiple MODIS channels to detect thermal anomalies on a per-pixel basis, which in\naddition to identifying fires includes high-temperature point sources such as gas flares and power\nplants. The burned area algorithm uses a multidate analysis and its development concentrated on\nsouthern Africa in the context of the SAFARI 2000 campaign (Swap et al., 2002).\n\n10.5.2 MODIS ACTIVE FIRE DETECTION\nTheMODIS active fire detection algorithmwas based on earlier similar algorithms developed for NOAA/\nAVHRR (Giglio et al., 1999), and the Tropical Rainfall Mapping Mission Visible Infrared Radiation\nSpectrometer (Kaufan et al., 1990). The 4 and 11 mm channels (T4 and T11) are used again. Unlike its\npredecessorsMODIS has two 4 mm channels numbered 21 and 22 both of which are used in the detection\n\n10.5 FOREST FIRE DETECTION AND MAPPING 731\n\n\n\nalgorithm. Channel 21 saturates at about 500 K while channel 22 saturates at 331 K. The low-saturation\nchannel is less noisy and has a smaller quantization error, it is used the derive T4 whenever possible.\nWhen it saturates, however, the calculation shifts to channel 21. The T11 value is computed from the\nsingle 11 mm channel number 31 which saturates at approximately 400 K. The 250 m spatial resolution\nnear-infrared channel (0.86 mm) is averaged up to a 1 km resolution to be consistent with the other\nchannels and is used to identify high reflective surfaces that maybe falsely identified as fires.\n\nThis fire detection algorithm is based on the absolute detection of the fire if the fire is strong\nenough, and the detection relative to the thermal emission of the surrounding pixels detect weaker\nfires. This latter part of the algorithm is designed to account for variability of the surface temperature\nand reflection by sunlight. For absolute fire detection the algorithm requires that at least one of two\nconditions be satisfied. These are as follows:\n\n1. T4 > 360 K (330 K at night)\n2. T4 > 330 K (315 K at night) and T4eT11 > 25 K (10 K at night)\n\nIf either of these two conditions is not met the algorithm then pursues a relative fire detection in which\nthe fire is distinguished from the mean background by three standard deviation in T4 and in T4eT11. The\nmean, median, and standard deviations are computed for pixels within an expanding grid centered on\nthe candidate fire pixel until a sufficient number of cloud-water and fire-free pixels are identified.\nA sufficient number is identified as 25% of all background pixels with a minimum of six. Water pixels\nare identified with an external water mask and cloud pixels are identified by the MODIS cloud mask.\nFire-free pixels are those for which T4 < 325 K (315 K at night) and T4 \u00bc T11 < 20 K (10 K at night). If\neither standard deviation is less than 2 K, a value of 2 K is used instead. For daytime fire detection when\nsunglint may cause false alarms, a fire pixel is rejected if the MODIS 250 m red and near-infrared\nchannels have a reflectance above 30% and lies within 40 degrees of the specular reflection position.\n\nEach fire product is associated with a detection confidence estimate to help the users gauge the\nquality of the individual fire pixels. This confidence estimate assigns one of three fire classes\n(low-confidence, nominal-confidence, or high-confidence) to all fire pixels with the fire mask area. In\naddition total emitted power is assigned to each fire pixel (Kaufman et al., 1998). The MODIS fire\nproducts and their release dates are presented here in Table 10.2.\n\nThese standard MODIS fire products are distributed from the Earth Resources Observation\nSystems Data Center (EDC) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC). A description of these\nproducts can be found in Masuoka et al. (1998).\n\nOne unique product is the global browse images of the MODIS active fire product that are\ngenerated daily at 5 and 20 km spatial resolutions (Fig. 10.24).\n\nThese products show the global distribution of fires for each day and have been useful for pre-\nliminary QA, allowing easy identification of potential problems such as excessive false alarms. This\nbrowse type of product allows for a quick assessment of areas with distinct changes in fire activity.\n\nThe MODIS Rapid Response System was specifically developed in response to the need in the fire\ncommunity for rapid detection and monitoring of a fire. The standard MODIS fire products run\napproximately 7 days behind the current image acquisition date. For fire management and response\nagencies this is too long an interval to be useful. The US Forest Service (USFS) generally wants\ninformation within a few hours of image acquisition to support fire management. In April, 2001 the\nRapid Response System was initiated (Justice et al., 2000), and it provides MODIS fire data and\nimagery to the USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center in Salt Lake City and the National\n\n732 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nTable 10.2 MODIS Fire Products\n\nOn Orbit Name Before Launch Launch Date\nAVHRR\nVersion End of Mission\n\nTIROS-N TIROS-N October 1978 1\n\nNOAA-6 NOAA-A June 1979 1 November 11, 1986\n\nNOAA-7 NOAA-C June 1981 2 June 7, 1986\n\nNOAA-8 NOAA-E March 1983 1 October 31, 1985\n\nNOAA-9 NOAA-F December 1984 2 November 5, 1994\n\nNOAA-10 NOAA-G September 1986 1 October 2000\n\nNOAA-11 NOAA-H September 1988 2 September 13, 1994\n\nNOAA-12 NOAA-D May 1991 1 August 10, 2007\n\nNOAA-13 NOAA-I August 1993 Failed after launch\n\nNOAA-14 NOAA-J December 1994 2 October 3, 2001\n\nNOAA-15 NOAA-K May 1998 3 AM operational, secondary\n\nNOAA-16 NOAA-L September 2000 3 PM operational, secondary\n\nNOAA-17 NOAA-M June 2002 3 AM operational, backup\n\nNOAA-18 NOAA-N May 2005 3 PM operational, secondary\n\nNOAA-19 NOAA-N0 February 2009 3 PM operational, primary\nMETOP-A METOP-A October 2006 3 AM operational, primary\n\nFIGURE 10.24\n\nDaily daytime active fire detection product over daily land surface reflectance (MOD14 over MOD09) for June\n\n7, 2017.\n\n10.5 FOREST FIRE DETECTION AND MAPPING 733\n\n\n\nInteragency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. The Rapid Response System takes data directly from the\nEDOS data, feed to NOAA at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and generates Level 1B data\nproducts using the International MODIS/AIRS Processing Package (IMAPP) provided by the Uni-\nvesity of Wisconsin. The MODIS fire algorithm is applied to this image data and images are then\ngenerated by superimposing the 1 km active fires on the 250 m corrected reflectance image for the\nsame acquisition. An example is presented here in Fig. 10.25.\n\nAn interesting capability resulting from the MODIS fire products is the ability to make a global\nmap of cumulative fire detection. An example is presented here in Fig. 10.26 that clearly shows those\nregions of persistent fire activity. You can see the biomass burning that takes place in eastern South\nAmerica along with the fires in central and southern Africa. Less well known are the fires of India and\neast Asia along with the band in northern Australia. It is surprising to see that fires are more prevalent\nover this period in the eastern United States rather than in the west where fires are thought to frequently\noccur. There is a wide swath of fire activity from central Europe across central Russia.\n\n10.5.3 MODIS FIRE VALIDATION\nValidation requires an independent source of information on the fires to which the MODIS derived fire\nproducts can be compared. This validation source should have a high level of accuracy in that it\nrepresents an independent source of fire information. Sources of this type of validation information can\n\nFIGURE 10.25\n\nStar fire near Lake Tahoe, California, on August 27, 2001, 19e22 UTC. Pixels containing active fires, outlined\n\nin red, are superimposed on corrected true-color reflectances.\n\nCourtesy of AIRBUS Defense and Space.\n\n734 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nbe collected with aircraft, on the ground and from other satellite data. There are often great difficulties\nin aligning these independent fire observations with MODIS fire products due to the very variable\nnature of fires in both time and space.\n\nAs mentioned earlier the ASTER instrument operated onboard the TERRA spacecraft offering high\nresolution infrared data. This instrument has 15 spectral bands from 0.5 to 10 mm at resolutions from\n15 to 90 m (Yamaguchi et al., 1998). Using ASTER data Justice et al. (2002) were able to obtain a\nglobal example of high-resolution fire detection. These high resolution fire retrievals were then\nmapped on to coincident MODIS pixels. Justice et al. (2002) describe a validation exercise using four\nASTER scenes that fell within two MODIS scenes over southern Africa (Table 10.2). The ASTER data\nwere first converted to a high-resolution fire map with a simple threshold. Fires less than 1000 m2 will\nsaturate the ASTER band 9 (2.4 mm) and therefore a simple saturation threshold for cloud-free scenes\ncan be used to identify fires in ASTER data. On these high-resolution ASTER fire maps, fire pixels\nwithin 150 m of each other were grouped together to form a single \u201cfire cluster.\u201d The ASTER fire\nclusters and MODIS pixels were then associated by mapping the 1 km2 of each MODIS pixel onto the\nASTER data. A registration accuracy of better than 300 m can be estimated according to the regis-\ntration accuracy of each instrument, which is less than 100 m for ASTER and less than 200 m for\nMODIS (Wolfe et al., 2002).\n\nAs a validation Justice et al. (2002) looked at: (1) the number of ASTER clusters with a MODIS\npixel, (2) the average size of these clusters, and (3) the maximum size of the ASTER fire clusters. The\ndistributions of these variables were then sorted into two groups based on whether or not their\ncorresponding MODIS pixel was classified as no-fire or fire. These distributions are presented here as\nbox plots in Fig. 10.27.\n\nFIGURE 10.26\n\nGlobal cumulative active fire detections (April 23, 2001 to February 25, 2002) from MODIS Land Rapid\n\nResponse System.

This indicates that the MOD14 product behaves appropriately relative to the observed\nASTER data; more and larger fire clusters are associated with those MOD14 pixels classified as fire.\nScatter plots of these same data also confirmed the agreement between MODIS fire pixels and those\nidentified in the ASTER data.\n\n10.5.4 THE HAYMAN WILDFIRE IN COLORADO\nThe largest wildfire in Coloradowas the Hayman Fire that was actually set by a volunteer forest worker to\ndemonstrate her prowess in detecting and eliminating wildfires. The fire was first reported in the late\nafternoonof June8,2002.Lowhumidity,warmtemperatures, andhighwindspeeds facilitated thefire\u2019s hot\ntemperature and rapid spread along the South Platte River corridor. For 20 days the fire consumed public\n\nFIGURE 10.27\n\n(AeD) box plot of ASTER-derived variables for MODIS14-no-fire (0) or fire (1) for scenes AeD, respectively.\n\nFrom Justice, C.O., Giglio, L., Korontzi, S., Owens, J., Morisette, J.T., Roy, D., Descloitres, J., Alleaume, S., Petitcolin, F.,\n\nKaufman, Y., 2002.

The\nfire was very well studied by the USFS, the Colorado Forest Service, and the US Department of\nAgriculture. The fire was located in steep terrain and persisted over a fairly long period of time. Fanned\nby strong winds the fire grew explosively and was located in a fairly inaccessible area (Fig. 10.28).\n\nAnother map in Fig. 10.29 shows the location of the Hayman Fire relative to the South Platte River\nand the surrounding communities. The communities of Deckers and Lake George were threatened by\nthe fire. The greatest burn severity was in the northeast sector of the fire where the fire raced through\nthe South Platte River valley. Unburned patches represent higher elevations where the topmost trees\nwere left unburned.\n\nAn AVHRR image from June 9 just after the start of the fire (Fig. 10.30) shows both the large\nsmoke plume associated with the fire and the intense burn location on the ground. The strong winds\nblowing northwest up the canyon are clearly indicated by the smoke plume trending in this direction.\n\nASTER was again used to map the fire hot spot as can be seen on this mid-infrared (3.7 mm)\nASTER channel image (Fig. 10.31). The maximum, minimum, and mean brightness temperatures are\nindicated in the upper left of the image. The distinct shape of the fire that was dictated by the local\ntopography can be clearly seen in this thermal emission image.\n\nA coincident long-wave thermal infrared (10.8 mm) ASTER image (Fig. 10.32) exhibits a similar\npattern, but weaker emissions and much lower temperatures. This reflects the fact that in this wavelength\n\nFIGURE 10.28\n\nThe Hayman Fire.

This was used as a fire indicator algorithm in\nthe Justice et al. (2002) study.\n\nA comparison between an AVHRR fire product and the MODIS fire product for the Hayman Fire\n(Fig. 10.33) demonstrates that the AVHRR is in general too high while most of the MODIS fire pixels\nare appropriate. There are a couple of MODIS pixels that also read too high in this case.\n\n10.6 MEASURING AND MONITORING VEGETATION FROM SPACE\nThe measurement of vegetative activity on the Earth\u2019s surface has been very actively studied with both\noptical and microwave satellite data. One of the most widely used indices of vegetative health is the\nNDVI. Defined as:\n\nNDVI \u00bc RNIR ? RVIS\nRNIR \u00fe RVIS ; (10.1)\n\nwhere RNIR and RVIS represent reflectances averaged over ranges of wavelengths in the visible\n(w0.6 mm centered in the red) and near infrared (w0.8 mm) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nThis NDVI is not an intrinsic physical quantity, but rather it is correlated with certain physical\n\nBackground Temperature\nNODIS Data Day161 455 UT \n\nAVHRR Data Day161 15:05 UT\n\n288\n\n289\n\n291\n\n290\n\n292\n\n293\n\n294\n\n295\n\n296\n\n288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296\n\nAVHRR is too high\n\nMODIS is high\n\n* Note MODIS image is in the early morning\nwhile the AVHRR is in mid-afternoon\n\nTB MODIS Temp \u00baK\n\nTB\n A\n\nV\nH\n\nR\nR\n\n T\nem\n\np \n\u00baK\n\nFIGURE 10.33\n\nComparison between an advanced very high resolution radiometerederived fire product and a MODIS fire\n\nproduct. Note the difference in satellite overpass time.\n\n740 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nproperties of the vegetation canopy that it views from above such as: LAI, fractional vegetation cover,\nvegetation condition (health), and biomass. In spite of this limitation the NDVI is very useful in that it\ncan be sensed by a wide variety of satellite sensors.\n\nThe NDVI has been criticized for the following limitations:\n\n1. Differences between the \u201ctrue\u201d NDVI measured at the Earth\u2019s surface and that measured in space\nare created by the intervening atmosphere which can attenuate the NDVI signal due to the\npresence of aerosols in the atmosphere.\n\n2. The sensitivity of NDVI to LAI becomes weaker as the LAI increases up to a threshold value\nsomewhere between 2 and 3.\n\n3. Variations in soil brightness may produce large variations in NDVI from one image to the next\n(Liu and Huete, 1995).\n\nAs a result many investigators have suggested alternate indices that are designed to correct for\nsome of these limitations (Jasinski, 1996; Leprieur et al., 1996; Liu and Huete, 1995; Pinty and\nVerstraete, 1992).\n\nThe NDVI increases almost linearly with increasing LAI up to an asymptotic point where NDVI\nincreases very slowly with increasing LAI. This is a region where the canopy is completely filled with\nleaves (Curran, 1983). This generally occurs for NDVI values of 0.5e0.8 for dense vegetation. The\nupper limit depends on vegetation type, age, and leaf water content (Paltridge and Barber, 1988).\n\nIn their study Carlson and Riply (1997) use a simple radiative transfer calculation to show: (1) the\nvariation of NDVI with local and global LAI, (2) that the customary variation of NDVI with LAI can\nbe largely explained by variations in fractional vegetation cover, (3) that NDVI decreases much less\nrapidly with increasing global LAI when the fractional vegetation cover reaches 100%, (4) that scaling\nthe NDVI between values for bare soil and 100% vegetation cover factors out most of the needed\natmospheric correction, and (5) provides further evidence to confirm the existence of a simple relation\nbetween scaled NDVI and fractional vegetation cover.\n\nThe radiative components of this model are represented here in Fig. 10.34. The NDVI was\ncalculated from the reflectance values in two wavelength bands one in the visible (0.5e0.7 mm)\nand near infrared (0.7e0.9 mm) regions of the spectrum. It should be noted that this is an arbitrary\nselection and when observing the NDVI from space borne sensors the definition of the VIS and NIR\nchannels is set by the particular instrument onboard the satellite.\n\nIn their radiative transfer simulations, they varied parameters such as LAI to determine how the\nNDVI would change. Fig. 10.35 shows NDVI as functions of LAI for both an NDVI uncorrected for\natmospheric attenuation and an NDVI corrected using MODTRAN atmospheric simulations.\n\nWe can conclude from these simulations that the apparent NDVI at the asymptotic threshold is\nbetween 0.05 and 0.10 below the values corresponding to an infinitely large LAI (Carlson and Riply,\n1997). From this, we can further conclude that for areas where the vegetation is just reaching 100% the\nNDVI will be adequately represented by values slightly less than the maximum found in the image\nover dense vegetation.\n\nOne of the big advantages of using NDVI as an index is that it is a normalized quantity and it really\njust indicates the relative health of the vegetation being viewed. It can not be used as an accurate\nmeasurement of LAI or biomass, but it can suggest where both are high or low. NDVI is sensitive to\nchanges in the fractional vegetation cover until a full canopy is reached beyond which further increase\nin LAI results in small and asymptotic increases in NDVI. The identification of an NDVI threshold\n\n10.6 MEASURING AND MONITORING VEGETATION FROM SPACE 741\n\n\n\nbetween full and partial vegetation cover allows one to scale NDVI between bare soil and 100%\nvegetation cover. In addition, the model radiative transfer simulations suggest that this relation holds\nequally well for NDVI whether or not it is corrected for atmospheric attenuation.\n\n10.6.1 THE AVHRR NDVI 8-KM DATASET\nOne of the most widely used sensors for the computation of NDVI was the AVHRR. This group\ndescribed this dataset in Tucker et al. (2005), which discusses the AVHRR NDVI dataset in the context\nof similar products based on MODIS and SPOT data. This product consisted of daily daytime AVHRR\nGlobal Area Coverage data reduced to an 8-km equal-area dataset from July 1981, through December\n2004, for all continents except Antarctica. Also unique to this dataset were bimonthly composites and\nan effort to correct and compensate for volcanic aerosols in the atmosphere. In addition, for Africa-\nonly there was a 10-day composite NDVI product. Considerable postprocessing was needed to cor-\nrect for dropped scan lines, image navigation errors, other data dropouts, and edge-of-orbit composite\ndiscontinuities.\n\nFIGURE 10.34\n\nSchematic representation of the direct and diffuse radiance components interacting with the plant canopy\n\nand the soil. Single or direct scattering from the canopy and/or from the soil is indicated by a prime and double\n\nscattering by a double prime (Schluessel et al., 1994).\n\n742 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nAccording to Tucker et al. (2005) the NDVI has become the most used vegetation product derived\nfrom NOAA AVHRR data (Cracknell, 2001), largely in the form of maximum value compositing\n(Holben, 1986). By compositing on maximum NDVI value any residual clouds are suppressed since\nclouds will only lower the NDVI value. Thus, an initial cloud mask is applied and then composites are\nformulated using the maximum NDVI procedure. Tucker et al.

SPOT\nVegetation (VGT) has similar bands that are a bit narrower than AVHRR while MODIS bands are very\nmuch narrower. Likewise, SeaWIFS (an ocean color instrument) has relatively narrow bands in both\nthe visible and near infrared.\n\nIn their NDVI product (Tucker et al., 2005) every composite image was manually checked for\nimage navigation accuracy by comparing the mapped data to a reference coastline for every continent.\nImages with >?1 pixel navigation error were individually investigated and the data reprocessed to\nmaintain the 1 pixel navigation accuracy over the entire product dataset. This group decided to use\nmaximum compositing as the method to correct for any and all atmospheric effects.\n\n10.6.2 USING NDVI TO IDENTIFY AND MONITOR CORN GROWTH\nIN WESTERN MEXICO\n\nA study in 2006 (Chen et al.) examined the use of a MODIS derived NDVI, a MODIS derived\nEnhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and a SPOT VGT index to map and monitor the corn crop in\nwestern Mexico. Overall the NDVI derived from the SPOT-VGT sensor, based on a bidirectional\ncompositing method, produced vegetation information most closely resembling actual crop condi-\ntions. By comparison the MODIS NDVI values were found to be saturated 30 days after planting but\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0.4\n\nM\nO\n\nD\nIS\n\nAV\nH\n\nR\nR\n\nS\nea\n\nW\nIF\n\nS\nV\n\nG\nT\n\n0.6 0.8\nWavelength (?m)\n\n1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.5\n\nFIGURE 10.36\n\nSpectral acceptance of the advanced very high resolution radiometer instruments in comparison to SPOT\n\nVegetation, SeaWIFS, and the MODIS visible and near-infrared bands.

The temporal maximum value NDVI\ncomposites for the VGT sensor reached its maximum plateau at about 80 days, which then masked\nthe important crop transformation from the vegetative stage to the reproductive stage. The EVI\ncomputed from MODIS reached a maximum plateau 40 days earlier than the maximum LAI and the\nmaximum intercepted fraction of photosynthetic active radiation as derived from in situ measure-\nments. This study demonstrated that the 250 m spatial resolution MODIS bands did not provide any\nmore accurate vegetation information for corn growth description than the larger resolution 500 m\nand 1 km bands.\n\nAn example of the image data examined in this study is provided here in Fig. 10.37. The location of\nthe study area is shown in a small map in the upper left of this figure.\n\n10.6.3 MICROWAVE REMOTE SENSING OF VEGETATION AND SOIL MOISTURE\nPassive and active microwave data have also been used to detect and map vegetation as well as the soil\nmoisture beneath the plant canopy, as discussed in Section 10.2.4 for ESA\u2019s SMOS mission. A\ncomparison between optical and microwave remote sensing of vegetation density over Mongolia was\ncarried out by Liu et al. (2006). They find that optical and microwave data provide complementary\nsources of information on vegetation. They compared the NDVI derived from AVHRR imagery with a\nvegetation optical depth (VOD) computed from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager data collected over\nMongolia from 1998 to 2006. Both of these data sources exhibited similar spatial distributions in terms\nof their annual averages and both are found to capture well the interannual variability of the vegetation.\nLonger term changes, however, are found to diverge in the two different data types. The microwave\nVOD shows long-term decreasing trends over grassland, whereas the optical NDVI exhibits weaker\ndeclines and in some cases even increases.\n\nThe similarities in long-term means is shown here in Fig. 10.38, which shows both the VOD and\nNDVI centered on Mongolia from 1988 to 2006.\n\nHere, clearly the spatial patterns are very similar with the AVHRR-derived NDVI showing more\ndetail due to the higher spatial resolution of the optical data. The passive microwave VOD has much\nsmoother features, but still the basic patterns and relative values are essentially the same between the\ntwo fields. Low values are seen over the southern Gobi desert regions, and high values are found in the\nforest in northern Mongolia. Moderate values are found in the pastureland and cropland regions\nbetween these two different areas.\n\nTo demonstrate the similarities in the year-to-year variations both the VOD and NDVI are\npresented here in Fig. 10.39 for August 2003 (a wet year) and 2004 (a dry year).\n\nThe interannual variation between 2003 and 2004 can be easily seen in both the NDVI and the\nVOD by the increased area covered by red and yellow values in 2004 as compared with 2003. Thus,\nthe dry character evidences itself more in terms of greater areas of low vegetation index values than in\nthe severity of the decrease in the index value itself.\n\nTo test for long-term changes in these vegetation index data sets the Mann-Kendall index (Gilbert,\n1987) was calculated for each (Fig. 10.40). In this comparison you can clearly see differences between\nthe two estimates of vegetation. The VOD shows a very much larger decrease in vegetation index in\nnorthern central Mongolia than is seen in the corresponding NDVI. Again the smoother nature of the\nVOD is clearly apparent as is the higher spatial resolution of the AVHRR-derived NDVI. The NDVI\nactually exhibits a slight increase in northern Mongolia at about 100?E where the dark red values in\n\n10.6 MEASURING AND MONITORING VEGETATION FROM SPACE 745\n\n\n\nVOD display a very dramatic drop in vegetation. Thus, we must conclude that NDVI and VOD are not\nequivalent in all respects and that consideration must be given to the source of information in any and\nall analyses.\n\nIn a similar study Jones et al., (2010) studied the phenology of global vegetation using these same\ndata sources (satellite optical and passive microwave). The VOD was computed by the Advanced\n\nFIGURE 10.37\n\nIrrigated corn fields in El Carrizo study area in Sinaloa state, western Mexico: (A) on Landsat-7 ETM\u00fe image\ndate on February 8, 2002, as a false color composite of the green, red, and near-infrared bands, (B) and 10\n\nsampled locations, (C) pixels in red color were agricultural fields planted with corn, and pixels in other colors\n\ninclude fallow, lands, urban areas, water bodies, and agricultural field for other crops.\n\n746 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nMicrowave Scanning Radiometer-Earth (AMSR-E) flying on NASA\u2019s Aqua afternoon satellite. The\nadvantage of this VOD for monitoring the phenology of global vegetation is its lack of sensitivity to\ncloud cover and its independence of solar illumination. The VOD in this study was found to respond to\nchanges in plant canopy biomass and water content. For comparison the EVI was calculated from the\nMODIS instrument also flying on the Aqua satellite, thus providing vegetation estimates coincident in\nspace and time. This EVI was combined with the NDVI also computed from MODIS in what has been\ncalled the enhanced TIMESAT algorithm for retrieving vegetation phenology metrics from 250 to\n500 m spatial resolution MODIS data. In addition to the satellite data, a bioclimatic phenology model\nwas used to compare global vegetative phenology from 2003 to 2008. Jones et al. (2010) found good\ncorrespondence between the VOD and the optical vegetation indices (VIs) across most global biomes.\nThis correspondence degraded over regions with persistent cloud cover due primarily to optical VI\ndegradation and to phase-shifts or lags between the VI and VOD phenology signals. While the VOD\n\nFIGURE 10.38\n\nAnnual average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and vegetation optical depth (VOD) during\n\n1988e2006.\n\n10.6 MEASURING AND MONITORING VEGETATION FROM SPACE 747\n\n\n\nand VIs covary, they do not detect identical changes in seasonal plant dynamics and are sensitive to\nindependent, yet complementary, vegetation surface effects.\n\nThe mean global VOD is presented here in Fig. 10.41.\nThe algorithm to compute this VOD uses AMSR-E descending (AM, morning pass) Aqua satellite\n\noverpass horizontally (H) and vertically (V) polarized brightness temperatures for the 18.7 and\n23.8 GHz frequencies to derive a slope parameter that is sensitive to vegetation and surface roughness.\nThis slope parameter shows minimum sensitivity to changes in soil moisture, a parameter that is sensed\nusing the lower frequency microwave signals. It is also largely independent of open water effects with\na good sensitivity to canopy density. The smoothed slope parameter is then inserted into a tau-omega\nradiative transfer model and inverted to solve for VOD at 6.9, 10.7, and 18.7 GHz.\n\nJones et al. (2010) used the VOD data together with the TIMESAT 3.0 algorithm to compute the\nphenology metrics of the start, length, and end of growing season for the entire globe (Fig. 10.42) over\nthe years 2003e08.\n\nThe areas with the latest start to their vegetation are in the Amazon and tropical South Africa There\nis some later start in parts of South China. The early starts take place in the polar regions, in central\nSouth America, and western North America, as well as in northern Australia. The maps at the end of\nthe season are very different with the earlier values in tropical west Africa, the northern Midwest\nUnited States and in western Russia. There are also regions of early end date in central and southern\nIndia and in western China. The Korean peninsula also exhibits some early terminal dates. The late end\n\nFIGURE 10.39\n\nMonthly Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and vegetation optical depth for August 2003 and 2004.\n\n748 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nFIGURE 10.40\n\nTrends in annual mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and vegetation optical depth between 1988\n\nand 2006 using the Mann-Kendall analysis.\n\nFIGURE 10.41\n\nThe vegetation optical depth computed from AMSR-E data for 2003e08.\n\n10.6 MEASURING AND MONITORING VEGETATION FROM SPACE 749\n\n\n\nFIGURE 10.42\n\nPhenology metrics of start (top), length (bottom), and end (middle) of the growing season for 2003e08.\n\n750 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nof season regions are in central South America, all of southern Africa, high-latitude North America,\nand Russia along with pockets in western Australia.\n\nThe length of the growing season has its maximum in the mid-latitude northern hemisphere where\ncrops are mainly grown. The shortest growing seasons (dark blues) are in tropical west Africa, central\nAfrica, southern Colombia and Venezuela, southern United States (Texas), northern China, and\nwestern Australia.\n\nTheir overall conclusion was that the AMSR-E VOD time series provides an independent measure\nof the phenology signal that can be considered complementary to the optical-IR measured vegetation\nindex information that has been routinely used in the past. The microwave nature of the VOD makes it\npossible to map global phenology even in areas that are persistently cloud covered. The comple-\nmentary nature of these two types of independent systems makes it possible to take advantage of the\nbest characteristics of each to get useful global maps of vegetative phenology.\n\nThere have been a number of studies of the measurement of soil moisture with passive microwave\ndata. One of the earliest studies is by Jackson and Schmugge in 1989, which used data from a sensor\noperating at a 21 cm wavelength to sense the amount of water present in soils or on its surface. This is\ndue to the large dielectric contrast between water and most solids at this wavelength. They report that\nthis contrast causes variations in soil\u2019s emissivity from about 0.95 when dry to less than 0.7 when wet.\nMicrowave remote sensing has the usual advantage of being weather independent, and it is also\npossible to measure soil moisture condition under moderate level of vegetation cover.\n\nPrevious studies of the interactions between the microwave observations and the target parameters\nhave established that for passive microwave systems the optimal wavelength for observing soil\nmoisture falls in the L-band range (20e30 cm) operating at near-nadir look angles and horizontal\npolarization. This past research has also established that the principle target parameter affecting the\nmicrowave emissivity is the volumetric soil moisture in the surface 5 cm of the soil. The conclusion is\nthat if a passive microwave L-band sensor was placed in orbit it would be possible to map and monitor\nsurface soil moisture on a regular basis. While the fundamental principles governing microwave\nemissivity from a smooth bare homogeneous soil with uniform vertical dielectric properties are well\nunderstood the problem is when you add in the complexity introduced by disruption of the soil, the\npresence of varied vegetation cover and alterations in soil moisture complicate the scene sufficiently\nthat it is difficult to model the scene much less to later verify the conditions.\n\nJackson and Schmugge (1989) introduce a pictorial of an algorithm for estimating surface soil\nmoisture with a passive microwave radiometer (Fig. 10.43).\n\nThe principle target variables in this model algorithm are soil properties, surface roughness, and\nvegetation characteristics. A soil target is made up of air, water, and soil. At microwave wavelengths,\nthe real part of the complex numbers representing the dielectric constants are as follows: air k \u00bc 1,\nsoil k \u00bc 4, and water k \u00bc 80. It is this very large contrast that makes the measurement of moisture in\nthe soil possible. As more water is added to the soil the dielectric increases. Bound water has a lower\ndielectric constant because these water molecules are adsorbed by the surfaces of the ground\nparticles, which immobilizes the dipoles. In soil this surface area is variable and depends primarily\non the amount, size, and shape of the clay particles in the soil. Two physical parameters best describe\nthis surface area and they are the specific surface area and the bulk density of the soil. The surface\narea will increase when either of these two variables increases. Typical soils range between 10\nand 150 m2/gm for the specific surface and bulk densities range between 1 and 1.5 gm/cm3. The\naccepted approach to estimate these parameters is to assume a thickness for the bound water layer\n\n10.6 MEASURING AND MONITORING VEGETATION FROM SPACE 751\n\n\n\nand a single average value of its dielectric constant. For bulk density it has been shown that regional\nestimates are adequate descriptions.\n\nJackson and Schmugge (1989) report that while there are many different ways to model the\nemission from a smooth bare soil, they all lead to the same conclusion, that microwave emission from\nsoil is the result of the integration of the emission from all depths and the importance of each depth\ndecreases with depth. The fraction of the upwelling radiation that is transmitted to the air will be called\nthe emissivity, and it is determined by the dielectric properties of a transition layer at the surface.\nStudies have shown this layer to be a few tenths of a wavelength, thus, a long wavelength sensor\nprovides more information on a thicker soil layer than does a shorter wavelength.\n\nReutov and Shutko (1986) performed a variety of simulations that clearly illustrate the contributing\ndepth phenomena. Here Fig. 10.44 shows both the soil system that was modeled and the effects of\nwavelength penetration for a single soil moisture value. At the top (Fig. 10.44A) the soil moisture\nconditions are set showing a transition layer from an air dry at the surface laying over a wet subsurface\nlayer with a uniform soil moisture (Wd) starting at a depth hd. A set of simulations is represented in\nFig. 10.44B, which clearly demonstrates that at shorter wavelength the sensor responds to a very\nshallow soil layer (<1 cm at a wavelength of 2.25 cm). As this wavelength increases the depth that the\nsensor sees through also increases. This layer is about 5 cm at L-band (wavelength of 21 cm). One\nother interesting result from Reutov and Shutko (1986) was that from their experimental program they\nfound that the actual transition depths were <3 cm. This means that an L-band sensor would be\nresponsive to most soil moisture conditions.\n\nWith a single-frequency sensor it is not possible to retrieve the profile of surface moisture. It is\nnecessary to relate the microwave observation to the conditions in a representative soil layer that in\nmost cases determines the emissivity. Experimental results have demonstrated that at L-band, a 5 cm\n\n?k\u20131\n?k+1\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\nPASSIVE MICROWAVE RADIOMETER MEASUREMENT OF SOIL MOISTURE\n(NADIR INCIDENCE ANGLE)\n\nTB     = Brightness Temperature\n?     = Atmospheric Transmissivity (~1)\n\neV       =  Vegetation Emissivity (0.5\u20131.0)\nTSKY   =  Reflected Sky Brightness(~5\u00baK)\nTSURF =  Thermal Temperature of Surface\nTATM   =  Direct Atmospheric Contribution (~0\u00baK)\n\neSURF =  Rough Surface Emissivity\nb      =  Vegetation Attenuation Parameter\nW    = Vegetation Water Content\n\neSOIL   = Soil Emissivity\nn      = Surface Roughness Parameter\n\nk      = Complex Dielectric Constant of the Soil\n\nRADIOMETER\n\nTB = ?[(1-eV) TSKY + eV TSURF] + TATM\n\neV =  1 + (eSURF \u20131) exp(bw)\n\neSURF =  1 + (eSOIL \u20131) exp(h)\n\neSOIL =  1 \u2013 |        |2\n\nFIGURE 10.43\n\nSchematic of an algorithm for estimating surface soil moisture using a passive microwave radiometer.\n\n752 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\ndepth is representative of all except very sandy soils in arid environments. It is likely that a separate\ndepth could be used for these conditions.\n\nThe curves in Fig. 10.45 show how well a combination of dielectric mixing models can be linked\nwith a simple emission model. For this case of bare smooth soil, the models reproduce the patterns of\nthe observations very well. As a result, the simplest approach to measuring soil moisture would then\n\n.9\n\nhd\n\nO\n\nh\n\n.7\n\ne\n\n.5\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n2.25 ?

These values\ncould then be used on their own to determine infiltration and/or evaporation, and to extrapolate to\ndeeper layers. Additional soil moisture information is available if two different wavelengths are used.\nBoth simulations (Blanchard and Bausch, 1979) and experimental measurements together with sim-\nulations (Reutov and Shutko, 1986) were used to study the use of two wavelengths. The latter found\nthat only one combination of transition depth andWd can produce a particular pair of emissivity values\nat two wavelengths. This means that given two emissivity values one can determine the depth of the\ntransition layer and the moisture below it. These authors also carried out airborne measurements\nas presented here in Fig. 10.46B where Wd was estimated from the aircraft measurements. Using the\ntwo-frequency approach, very good estimates of Wd were obtained from these measurements. A\nsingle-frequency radiometer adds very little information on Wd, but it can be used to estimate the\naverage moisture in a surface layer, and not Wd.\n\nAs pointed out earlier microwave emissivity from a soil surface is related to the reflectivity of that\nsurface which is why all of the modeling presented earlier addressed a bare, smooth soil surface where\nthe variations in the surface structure are a fraction of the wavelength being used.

(1979) that relates the\nemissivity of the smooth surface (esoil) and the roughness parameter to the emissivity of the surface\n(esurf) as given here in Eq. (10.2)\n\nesurf \u00bc 1\u00fe \u00f0esoil ? 1\u00de$eh. (10.2)\nJackson and Schmugge (1989) report that it does not appear that these effects are significantly\n\ndifferent over geographic regions with similar land management practices and therefore representative\nvalues of h can be used for regional studies.\n\nVegetation cover must be considered for most application purposes. The complexity of the\nvegetation itself in terms of modeling limits our understanding. Deterministic approaches have,\nhowever, been successful and have shown that soil moisture can be determined under a wide variety of\nplant canopy conditions. In principle a plant canopy over the soil attenuates the emissivity of the soil\nand adds to the total radiative flux with its own emission. This assumes that scattering is negligible,\nwhich should be true for longer wavelengths. A theoretical model of this process that treats the\nproblem using the electromagnetic relationships of a two-layer incoherent nonscattering medium was\ndeveloped by Basharinov and Shutko (1975). In their model the vegetation is treated simply as an\nabsorbing layer. The nature of the attenuation of this layer was modeled by Kirdiashev et al. (1979) as\nan optical depth that is dependent upon the plant shape, wavelength, look angle, and vegetation\nbiomass. The plant shape parameter is empirical. Jackson et al. (1982) proposed that the variance in the\nplant shape parameter was small for agricultural crops and that the attenuation varied linearly as a\nfunction of vegetation water content. Beside the change in sensitivity with vegetation water content,\nattenuation is also a function of wavelength. Kirdiashev et al. (1979) evaluated this effect using a\nparameter called the slope reduction factor. This is the ratio of the slope of the emissivity-soil moisture\nfunction with a vegetation cover to the bare soil slope (Fig. 10.47).\n\nAvalue of 1 indicates no effect while a small value means that most of the instrument sensitivity to\nsoil moisture has been lost.\n\nThere are more sophisticated models available to account for vegetation effects all of which\nrecognize the importance of the vegetation water content in determining the canopy effect. These\nmodels all require optimization or the establishment of an extensive database to develop parameter\nvalues for various plant canopies. The model proposed by Jackson et al. (1982) requires only an\nestimate of the vegetation wet biomass or water content. Biomass and water content can be estimated\nusing visible and near infrared remote sensing or multifrequency microwave data and would have\nother uses in agricultural and hydrologic applications. Passive microwave data can also be used to\nestimate biomass when the soil moisture and background emissivity are known. These relationships\nrequire atmospheric corrections. If the biomass was known for several data cells, a calibration could be\nperformed. One of the most likely targets for such a procedure would be flooded rice fields (Jackson\nand O\u2019Neill, 1986), since the emissivity of the background water is predictable and the microwave\nsensor data could then be used to predict biomass. This biomass estimate could then be compared with\nthat from the optical vegetation index value.\n\nIn a more recent paper (Jackson and Schmugge, 1991) explored the vegetation effects on micro-\nwave emissions of soils. They considered the vegetation present as requiring correction for the soil\n\n756 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nmicrowave emission. Improving upon the model discussed earlier they found that it was critical to be\nable to estimate the vegetation parameter b that characterizes the canopy. This paper is an exploration\nof the computation of this parameter for various observed vegetation characteristics. They concluded\nthat vegetation is semitransparent at longer microwave wavelengths. The degree of its influence on the\nmeasured data is dependent on the amount of vegetation, its type, and the parameters of the sensor\nsystem, that is, its wavelength.\n\nLooking at soybeans they found that the net effect of vegetation is a reduction in sensitivity that\nmakes it much more difficult to estimate soil moisture accurately (Fig. 10.48). An increase in the\nvegetation water content further reduces the sensitivity.\n\nReturning to the 1982, Jackson and Schmugge model, these authors argue that this relatively\nsimple model can be used to account for particular vegetation. This approach requires, in addition\nto the microwave brightness temperature, an estimate of the physical temperature at the surface, the\nvegetation water content, and a vegetation parameter (b). Physical temperature and vegetation\nwater content can be determined using existing techniques, but the dependence of the vegetation\nparameter (b) on various physical and sensor variables has not been established. The purpose of the\nJackson and Schmugge (1991) paper was to study this vegetation parameter for various plant\ncanopies. For specifics of this model the reader is directed to the 1982 and 1991 Jackson and\nSchmugge papers.\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\nE\nM\n\nIS\nS\n\nIV\nIT\n\nY\n\nVOLUMETRIC SOIL MOISTURE\n\nTREES (W = 6000)\n\nBROADLEAF (W = 1300)\n\nSHORTGRASS (W = 600)\n\nBARE SOIL\n\nW = Water content of the\n        vegetation in c/m2\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n\nFIGURE 10.47\n\nPredicted relationships between volumetric soil moisture and emissivity for bare soil and selected vegetation\n\ncanopies.\n\n10.6 MEASURING AND MONITORING VEGETATION FROM SPACE 757\n\n\n\nShutko (1986) suggested that in passive microwave remote sensing there are at least six significant\ncategories of vegetation:\n\n1. Small leaved culture such as cereal (small grains) crops in early stages, alfalfa (quasi-chaotic\norientation).\n\n2. Cereal crops near maturity (preferential orientation of stems).\n3. Broad leaf cultures (scattering effects important).\n4. Fruit and vegetables (fruit shadows the soil).\n5. Bush and forest vegetation (high biomass/area).\n6. Dense vegetation covers such as harvested grass and lodged vegetation.\n\nThis classification makes sense in terms of the physical parameters of the vegetation that can\ncontribute to attenuation of the passive microwave signal through scattering. In their study (Jackson\nand Schmugge, 1991) only consider the first three categories on this list. They claim that there is very\nlittle information available for vegetable crops. The report that Chukhlantsev et al. (1989) present the\nresults of a rather extensive data set collected over tomatoes. Their results show that a relationship\nbetween emissivity and soil moisture can be established throughout the growing season. Unfortunately,\nthis Russian study only reported on wet biomass as a function of emissivity. This lack prevents the\nanalysis of vegetation water content effects.\n\nThere is little point in attempting to estimate soil moisture under a forest canopy. Under these\nconditions, the vegetation water content is so large that it is unlikely that any useful information could\nbe extracted. Jackson et al. (1984) reported on observations made using aircraft radiometer at\nwavelengths of 6 and 21 cm that clearly showed no soil moisture effect on emissivity for a tree canopy.\n\n0 1 2\n\n200\n\nV\nO\n\nLU\nM\n\nE\nTR\n\nIC\n S\n\nO\nIL\n\n M\nO\n\nIS\nTU\n\nR\nE\n\n (%\n)\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n220 240 260 280\n\nBRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE (K)\n\nVEGETATION\nWATER CONTENT\n\n(KG/M2)\n\nFIGURE 10.48\n\nPredicted relationships between emissivity and soil moisture for a field with bare soil and soybeans.

It\nappears that under these conditions there is very little sensitivity to soil moisture and the signal is all\ndriven by the plant canopy moisture. This behavior was observed in aircraft data collected over the\nKonza Praire Natural Area by Schmugge et al. (1988). In this particular tall grass prairie there were\nsomewatershed areas in which there was no grazing or burning and other areas that were burned yearly\nor every other year. The latter watersheds exhibited predictable variations in brightness temperature\nwith moisture changes while the unburned areas showed little sensitivity to moisture falling from\nrainfall. It was assumed that this was due to the buildup of thatch or detritus matter of the soil surface\nover a number of years. This thatch layers acts as a highly emissive surface and this condition will only\noccur for lightly used or unburned grasslands and not in typical pastures.\n\nIn their study Jackson and Schmugge (1991) neglected atmospheric effects since all of the data\nthey analyzed were taken from field towers or low flying aircraft where even at the shorter wave-\nlengths the atmospheric effects are negligible. In addition, at the longer wavelengths that are most\nsuitable for soil moisture observations, atmospheric effects will be minimal even from satellite\naltitudes. For their study they examined a wide range of existing studies for which they had the\nrequirements that:\n\n1. Wavelength between 0.8 and 30 cm.\n2. Horizontal polarization.\n3. Look angle correctable to 0 degree.\n4. Data was available to determine optical depth s.\n5. Vegetation water content.\n6. Cover description.\n\nTable 10.3 briefly summarizes all of the studies that were used in the Jackson and Schmugge (1991)\npaper.\n\nUsing these data from historical studies, Jackson and Schmugge (1991) were able to construct a\nsummary plot reproduced here as Fig. 10.49.\n\nThis plot includes all of the cases presented in Table 10.3, and it was used to calculate the\nvegetation parameter b versus the wavelength l. All cases follow the trend of b decreasing with\nwavelength, which is expected from the analyses presented in Kirdiashev et al. (1979), Chukhlantsev\n(1988) and Pampaloni and Paloscia (1986). Kirdiashev et al. (1979) suggested a relationship that can\nbe described as\n\nb \u00bc b0=\nffiffiffi\n\nl\np\n\n; (10.3)\n\nfor fine leaved vegetation which is Pampaloni and Paloscia (1986) is\n\nb \u00bc b0=l. (10.4)\nIn each case b0 is the wavelength-independent parameter. Using Fig. 10.49 as a guide, it appears\n\nthat a linear relationship such as (10.3) might adequately describe the variation for a particular plant\ncover at wavelengths greater than 5 cm. At shorter wavelengths the b values change rapidly suggesting\na form more like (10.4). It is also very possible that the entire wavelength regime cannot be described\nby a single function. As noted earlier, the effects of scattering are more important at shorter\nwavelengths.\n\n10.6 MEASURING AND MONITORING VEGETATION FROM SPACE 759\n\n\n\nTable 10.3 Vegetation Data Sets Used in Study\n\nSource Cover Type\nWavelength\n(cm)\n\nOptical\nDepth\n\nVegetation Water\nContent (kg/m2) b\n\nShutko (1986) Broad leaf 3 0.950 2.0 0.475\n\n20 0.150 2.0 0.075\n\nJackson and O\u2019Neill\n(1990)\n\nCorn 6 d d 0.150\n\n21 d d 0.115\n\nSoybeans 6 d d 0.288\n\n21 d d 0.086\n\nKirdiashev\net a1.

They introduced an equation\nof the form\n\nb \u00bc b0$lx (10.5)\nwhere the value of x for wheat was ?1.08 and for soybeans ?1.38. Using the exponent for wheat we\nhave an equation very similar to Eq. (10.4). Eq. (10.5) was also fit a power function to the oat\nobservations reported by Matzler (1990). The resulting x exponent was ?1.47 and the resulting curve\nis included here in Fig. 10.49. It appears very similar to the relationship developed by Ulaby and\nWilson (1985) for wheat. Both crops have similar structures, and these results support the general\nresults for a stem-dominated cereal crop.\n\nThe summary results in Fig. 10.49 reveal that except for the grasses most vegetation can be\ncategorized as either leaf or stem dominated. All the corn and cereal crop data follow one pattern, and\nsoybean and alfalfa another. There is variability in this generalization that becomes more obvious as\nthe wavelengths get shorter. Part of the problem may be variations in the various cultures of the\nsoybean plants where some are tall with fewer leaves while others are short and bushy. In addition,\nthese crops have different growth stages when there will be variations between the relative numbers of\nleaves and stems.\n\nOne important observation from Fig. 10.49 is that if we exclude the grass observations, there is only\na very small variation of b in the L-band range (18e21 cm). Thus, it appears that a single value of b\nmight be used regardless of ground cover type, without introducing significant errors.

The parameter b is much larger than\nthat of other types of vegetation even at L-band. Fortunately for interpretation purposes, the vegetation\nwater contents are relatively low, resulting in relatively low optical depths, at least at L-band. The\nprimary concern here, however, is that the attenuation caused by grass is not just a function of changes\nin the nature of the canopy that result from growth (the bending of leaves and a thatch buildup).\n\nIn their paper Jackson and Schmugge (1991) concluded that soil moisture information can be\nretrieved using passive microwave remote sensing particularly at the lower L-band frequency. This is\ntrue even in the presence of a vegetation canopy, and they studied the dependence of the plant canopy\nparameter b on plant and sensor system characteristics using previous published results. They also\nconcluded that the relationship between b and wavelength can be divided into three categories: leaf\ndominated (soybeans, cotton, alfalfa), stem dominated (corn, wheat), and grasses.\n\n10.7 THE EUROPEAN COPERNICUS PROGRAM\nCopernicus is the European system for Earth monitoring. It consists of a complex set of systems that\ncollect data from multiple sources: Earth observation satellites (Fig. 10.50) and in situ sensors such as\nground stations, airborne, and sea-borne sensors. It processes these data and provides free-of-charge to\nthe users with reliable and up-to-date information through a set of services related to environmental\nand security issues (extracted from http://www.copernicus.eu/main/overview and https://sentinel.esa.\nint/web/sentinel/missions).\n\nThe services address six thematic areas: land, marine, atmosphere, climate change, emergency\nmanagement, and security. They support a wide range of applications, including environment pro-\ntection, management of urban areas, regional and local planning, agriculture, forestry, fisheries,\nhealth, transport, climate change, sustainable development, and civil protection, and they are co-\nordinated and managed by the European Commission. The development of the observation infra-\nstructure is performed by the European Space Agency (ESA), and by the European Environment\nAgency and the Member States for the in situ component of the Copernicus program, as illustrated in\nFig. 10.51.\n\nThrough the different thematic areas it addresses (land, marine, atmosphere, climate change,\nemergency management, and security), Copernicus supports applications in a wide variety of domains.\nThese include agriculture, forestry and fisheries, biodiversity and environmental protection, climate\nand energy, civil protection and humanitarian aid, public health, tourism, transport and safety, as well\nas urban and regional planning.\n\nThe Earth observation satellites that provide the data exploited by the Copernicus services are split\ninto two groups of missions:\n\n\u2022 The Sentinels (Fig. 10.52) that are currently being developed for the specific needs of the\nCopernicus program. Sentinel-1,-2, -3, -5P, and -6 are dedicated satellites, while Sentinel-4 and -5\nare instruments onboard EUMETSAT\u2019s weather satellites.\n\u2022 Sentinel-1 is a two satellite constellation with the prime objectives of land and ocean\n\nmonitoring. The goal of the mission is to provide C-Band SAR data continuity following the\nretirement of ERS-2 and the end of the Envisat mission.\n\n762 CHAPTER 10 LAND APPLICATIONS\n\nhttp://www.copernicus.eu/main/overview\nhttps://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions\nhttps://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions\n\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\nFIGURE 10.50\n\n(A) Copernicus Space Segment: the fleet of Sentinel satellites, (B) overview of the Sentinel\u2019s: the Copernicus\n\nsatellite fleet (http://www.space-airbusds.com/media/image/copernicus-poster-840x297_eng_1_1.jpg).\n\n10.7 THE EUROPEAN COPERNICUS PROGRAM 763\n\nhttp://www.space-airbusds.com/media/image/copernicus-poster-840x297_eng_1_1.jpg\n\n\n\u2022 Sentinel-2 comprises twin polar-orbiting satellites in the same orbit, phased at 180 degrees to\neach other.

Satellite\nsensing of these remote and inhospitable regions has opened a whole new world of information on\nthese geographic areas. In the Arctic there was some information from the Vikings back to 870 AD\nwith a more consistent record starting in 1600. Air temperature records extend back to 1880 and can be\nused as a proxy for sea ice, but even then, these temperatures were only measured at 11 coastal stations\naround the Arctic with no information on the ocean\u2019s interior. In the Antarctic the situation is even\nbleaker with little or no sea ice data prior to the era of satellite observations. There is some evidence\nthat the catch of whales in the southern hemisphere can be related to sea ice extent. Because whales\ntend to congregate near the sea ice edge to feed, their locations could be used as a proxy for ice extent.\n\nInitially, satellite remote sensing of polar regions was limited to the use of polar-orbiting weather\nsatellite imagery and to the use of Landsat imagery. These optical data are not optimal for studying the\npersistently cloudy polar regions. Later, satellites were launched specifically to study the polar regions\nconcentrating on both passive and active microwave sensing (radiometers and radars) that could\npenetrate the cloud cover. In addition LIDAR sensing optimized for retrieving polar sea ice height, ice\nsheet topography and snow cover was also later deployed. The long wavelengths of radar and passive\nmicrowave radiometer systems penetrate the persistent cloud cover that obscures the polar surfaces\nduring a large part of the year. Together with the continued analysis of operational weather satellite\ndata and Landsat the analysis of satellite data has revolutionized research in the polar regions.\n\nThis combination of optical and microwave data is very important; while the optical data are\nblocked by the persistent cloud cover they do have much greater spatial resolution and can often pick\nup details that are missed in the analysis of the microwave data with a much poorer spatial resolution.\nThis is only true for the passive microwave systems, because the spatial resolution is determined by the\nantenna dimensions. Thus, passive microwave sensors generally have spatial resolutions in the tens of\nkilometers. Active microwave systems can be designed to overcome this spatial resolution problem,\nand in fact, synthetic aperture radar can produce very high spatial resolutions at the expense of\nincreased data processing.\n\n11.2 POLAR OBSERVATIONS\nBefore discussing the satellite techniques for observing the cryosphere, we wish to discuss some of the\nprimary observables for this region that set it apart from the rest of the globe. The most distinctive\n\nCHAPTER\n\nIntroduction to Satellite Remote Sensing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809254-5.00011-7\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\n767\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809254-5.00011-7\n\n\nfeature of this region of the world is the presence of ice whether as sea ice or on the land as ice sheets or\nglaciers. Since the Arctic has no land in the center of the ocean it has been covered by sea ice\nthroughout recorded history. Before the satellite era was ushered in about 1970, the nature of this sea\nice was known only from expeditions that had crossed it or by submarine measurements that started as\nfar back as 1958. Submarines collected upward-looking sonar profiles that could be converted to sea\nice thickness. As these measurements were made for navigation and defense purposes the information\nwas not released until many years had passed. Thus, much of this submarine-based ice thickness\nmeasurement data has only come to light since 1985. These ice thickness data were restricted to the\ntracks of the submarines under the Arctic ice pack.\n\nAs a result, one of the very important polar ice parameters became ice thickness, which was related to\nice age with older sea ice being much thicker and more resilient than younger ice. In addition, sea ice\nrejects salt over time and becomes less salty resulting in a higher melting point. A simple two-category\nice classification was introduced that discriminated between \u201cfirst-year\u201d (FY) ice and \u201cmultiyear\u201d (MY)\nice. Within the designation MY ice the ice is classified as second, third, fourth year ice, etc. An\ninteresting study of Arctic ice age progression over time using satellite data can be found in Fowler et al.\n(2004). Here a merged set of microwave satellite data, infrared/visible satellite data, and in situ ice buoy\ndata was used to compute ice motion over a 25-year period. For this period, weekly individual ice areas\nwere followed over this duration and ice that exited the Arctic or melted were considered to be FY ice\nwhile ice that remained in the Arctic were then classified by the number of years that they persisted.\n\nAs an example, we present the Arctic sea ice age map for March 2012 in Fig. 11.1 along with a time\nseries of Arctic sea ice age computed from this same data set. Notice the now well-known decline of\nolder Arctic sea ice over time with a particular dip in 2007 when the Arctic ice cover hit a minimum\n(Maslanik et al., 2007). This minimum is most clearly marked by an increase in the FY ice cover. There\nis a modest recovery in ice cover after this minimum, but the ice cover never really reaches its earlier\nextent. More importantly as the map shows, the central ice pack is no longer made up primarily of\nolder ice, and the older ice have retreated along the northern boundary of the Canadian archipelago.\nAlso clear from this map is that a lot of the older sea ice is exiting the Arctic through Fram Strait along\nthe east coast of Greenland.\n\nThe cycle of freeze up and melt can be clearly seen in these data as shown here in Fig. 11.2. In\nSeptember 2014, there is a large amount of open water particularly along the Siberian and Alaskan\ncoasts. As in earlier years, the thicker ice hugs in the northern limits of the Canadian archipelago and\nnorthern Greenland. Moving to March 2015, most of the open water has been replaced by FY ice, but at\nthe same time the band of thicker ice has shrunk and continues to evidence the flow of ice out the Fram\nStrait. FY ice is mixed in with this outflow of MY ice. In both periods there is a tongue of third-year ice\nthat extends across the central Arctic terminating in a counterclockwise twist.\n\nPerhaps the most important ice parameter has to do with its cover. This is easily observed by\npassive microwave satellite instruments with the only limiting factor being the poor spatial resolution.\nThis only becomes a problem near the ice boundaries or in discriminating the types of sea ice. See\nSection 4.3.4.5 for more details.\n\nThere are two basic ways to express the total polar sea ice cover: total ice area and ice extent. To\nestimate the area covered, one estimates the percentage of ice in each pixel, multiply by the pixel area,\nand total them up. To estimate ice extent, one sets a threshold ice cover percentage and counts every\npixel meeting or exceeding that threshold as \u201cice covered.\u201d The common threshold level is 15% sea ice.\n\n768 CHAPTER 11 CRYOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nThis threshold method appears to be less accurate, but it has the advantage of being more consistent. In\ngeneral it is easier to say whether or not a pixel contains 15% ice or more as compared to saying if an ice\ncover is 70%or 75%.A reduction in the uncertainty of this estimation is necessary to be able to say if and\nhow the ice cover is changing over time.\n\nFIGURE 11.1\n\nIce age data show that the first-year ice made up 75% of the Arctic sea ice cover in March 2012. Thicker\n\nmultiyear ice used to make up about a quarter of the Arctic sea ice cover. Note it constitutes only 2%.\n\nNSIDC courtesy J. Maslanik and M. Tschudi, University of Colorado.\n\n11.2 POLAR OBSERVATIONS 769\n\n\n\n11.2.1 SATELLITE LASER ALTIMETRY\nThe first satellite dedicated to altimetric measurements of the polar regions was known as ICESat (Ice,\nCloud and land Elevation Satellite), which carried as a primary instrument a laser altimeter for accurate\nmeasurement of ice sheet elevation over Greenland and Antarctica. These elevation measurements were\nessential for a proper ice sheet mass balance calculation. In addition, ICESat observed stratospheric cloud\nproperty information in polar regions. Over other latitude bands, ICESat was able to measure topography\nand vegetation type around the globe.\n\nAfter significant delays ICESat was finally launched on January 12, 2003, into a high-inclination\npolar orbit. The sole instrument on ICESat was the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS),\nwhich was initially commanded to turn-on February 20, 2003, using the GLAS-1 laser. GLAS combined\na precision surface LIDAR with a sensitive dual-wavelength cloud and aerosol LIDAR. GLAS lasers\nemit infrared and visible laser pulses at 1064 and 532 nm wavelengths. Over an ICESat orbit, GLAS\nproduces a series of approximately 70-m diameter laser spots that are separated by about 170 m along\nthe spacecraft\u2019s ground track. During different phases of the mission, ICESat was placed in different\nrepeat orbits. During the final decommissioning phase the satellite was placed in an 8-day repeat orbit\nwhile during its operational life in 2004 the satellite was placed in a 91-day repeat orbit.\n\nGLAS was the first laser-ranging (LIDAR) instrument for continuous global observations of the\nEarth. GLAS was built by NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, MD. It is a facility\ninstrument designed to measure ice sheet topography and associated temporal changes, cloud and\natmospheric properties, and gives us information on the height and thickness of radiatively important\ncloud layers, which are needed to improve short-term weather prediction. GLAS comprises a laser\nsystem to measure distance, a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, and a star-tracker attitude\n\nFIGURE 11.2\n\nArctic sea ice age for September 22e28, 2014, and March 23e29, 2015.\n\n770 CHAPTER 11 CRYOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\ndetermination system. The laser transmits short pulses (4 ns) of infrared light (1064 nm) and visible\ngreen light (532 nm). Photons are reflected back to the spacecraft from the surface of the Earth and\nfrom clouds. These signals are collected in a 1-m diameter telescope (Fig. 11.3). Laser pulses at 40\ntimes per second illuminate spots (footprints) 70 m in diameter, spaced 170 m apart.\n\nICESat was designed to operate for 3e5 years. Ground testing indicated that each GLAS laser\nwould last for 2 years, which meant that ICESat would have to carry three lasers to complete the\nmission. During the initial on-orbit test operation, a pump diode module on the first GLAS laser failed\nprematurely on March 29, 2003. An investigation indicated that corrosive degradation of the pump\ndiodes, due to an unexpected, but known reaction between indium solder and gold bonding wires had\nresulted in this reduced life of the lasers. As a result the overall operational life of ICESat was reduced\nto just over a year. After 2 months of full operation in the fall of 2003, it was decided to operate the\nGLAS for 1 month out of every 3e6 months in an effort to extend the life of the satellite, which would\nbe particularly important for changes in ice sheet elevation.\n\nThe last of the three lasers failed on October 11, 2009, and since following attempts to restart also\nfailed the satellite was retired from service in February 2010. Between June 23, 2010, and July 14,\n2010, the spacecraft was maneuvered into a lower orbit to speed up orbital decay. On August 14, 2010,\nthe satellite was decommissioned and on 9:00 UTC on August 30, 2010, the satellite reentered the\natmosphere and burned up. So by a clever operational schedule, NASAwas able to squeeze out 7 years\nof data collection from the ICESat satellite.\n\nFIGURE 11.3\n\nGeoscience Laser Altimeter System Instrument on ICESat.\n\n11.2 POLAR OBSERVATIONS 771\n\n\n\n11.2.2 SATELLITE RADAR ALTIMETRY\nMore recently satellite radar altimetry has been utilized to map precise changes in the thickness of the\npolar ice sheets and floating sea ice. Launched April 08, 2010, the European Space Agency\u2019s CryoSat-2\n(Fig. 11.4) satellite carries a synthetic aperture radar (SAR)/interferometric radar altimeter (SIRAL),\nwhich has capabilities to measure ice sheet elevation and sea ice freeboard. To make this possible the\nsatellite also carries three star trackers for measuring the precise orientation of the satellite. This\norientation capability adds to orbital positioning accuracy provided by the French Doppler Orbit and\nRadiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) system and laser ranging from an onboard reflector.\n\nThe satellite operates in a 717 km orbit that reaches to 88?N allowing it to map both sea ice and\nland covering ice sheets. Unlike most satellites, CryoSat does not have any deployable solar panels.\nInstead the solar panels are rigidly fixed to the satellite\u2019s body forming a \u201croof\u201d with a carefully\noptimized angle designed to capture adequate power under all orbital conditions. In fact the satellite\nhas no moving parts except for some valves in the propulsion system. This design has resulted in\nconsiderable cost savings in the construction of the satellite. Designed with a nominal 3.5-year lifetime\nCryoSat continues to operate properly well past this time.\n\n11.3 SEA ICE\nOne of the most dramatic signs of global climate change has been seen in the extent and thickness\nchanges in Arctic sea ice. In the past, typically 15 million square kilometer of the Arctic Ocean was\ncovered by sea ice in winter. Satellite records have shown a constant downward trend in Arctic sea ice\nduring all seasons. There was a distinct minimum in 2007, but that was exceeded by the Arctic ice\ncover minimum in 2012 when CryoSat-2 measured 6000 cubic kilometer in October 2012. It is\ninteresting that CryoSat-2 observed an increase in Arctic sea ice cover up to 9000 cubic kilometer in\nOctober 2013. The autumn Arctic sea ice thickness from CryoSat-2 is presented here in Fig. 11.5.\n\nFIGURE 11.4\n\nArtist view of CryoSat.\n\nFrom ESA. http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2009/09/CryoSat_seen_from_underneath.\n\n772 CHAPTER 11 CRYOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\nhttp://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2009/09/CryoSat_seen_from_underneath\n\n\nSeasonal changes of sea ice have a significant influence on the global ocean circulation pattern in\nterms of the thermohaline circulation. As ice melts it introduces freshwater into the surrounding ocean\nreducing salinity and the density of the seawater. Conversely as sea ice forms under cooling conditions\nthe salinity and density of the surface water (now being changed to ice) increase. This density increase\ncauses the seawater to sink driving deep ocean currents toward the equator and away from the polar\nregions. Continuity requires a return flow of warmers, less dense surface northward from the lower\nlatitudes. In the North Atlantic this current is the Gulf Stream, which carries warm surface water\nnorthward from the Gulf of Mexico to the subpolar regions east of Greenland. This flow of warm water\nis very important in moderating the climate in Western Europe. Fig. 11.6 shows the thermohaline\ncirculation where the blue lines are the cold waters, and the red lines the warm waters.\n\n11.4 ICE SHEETS\nOne of the biggest contributions to global sea level rise is the melting of land-fast ice sheets on\nAntarctica and Greenland in addition to the rapidly shrinking glaciers on the continental landmasses. It\nis widely accepted that after the year 2000, ice sheets are melting at their base. Between 1992 and\n2012, the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets alone added 11.1 mm to global sea levels,\n\nFIGURE 11.5\n\nAutumn sea ice thickness from CryoSat 2010e13.\n\n11.4 ICE SHEETS 773\n\n\n\nwhich is 20% of the overall sea level rise for that same period. CryoSat observations show that between\n2010 and 2013, West Antarctica, East Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula lost 134, 3, and\n23 billion tons of ice each year, respectively. These recently measured losses from Antarctica alone\n(Fig. 11.7) are enough to raise global sea level by 0.45 mm each year. The improvement in resolution\n\nFIGURE 11.6\n\nSchematic global oceanic thermohaline circulation: deep cold water flow (blue) and warm surface flow (red).\n\nFrom Hogan, C., 2012. Thermohaline Circulation.

It was designed to satisfy the requirements for both ice\nsheet and sea ice freeboard (height of the sea ice protruding from thewater) measurements. Conventional\nradar altimeters send pulses at intervals long enough that the echoes are uncorrelated so that many echoes\ncan be averaged to reduce noise. At a typical satellite orbital speed of 7 km/s, the interval between pulses\nis about 500 ms. By comparison, the SIRAL sends a burst of pulses at an interval of only 50 ms. The\nreturning echoes are correlated and by treating the whole burst together, the data processor can separate\nthe echoes into strips arranged across the track by exploiting the frequency shifts, caused by the Doppler\neffect, in the fore and aft looking parts of the radar beam. Each strip is about 250 m wide and the interval\nbetween bursts is arranged so that the satellite moves forward by 250 m each time. The strips laid down\nby successive bursts can therefore be superimposed on each other and averaged to reduce the instrument\nnoise. This mode of operation is known as SAR mode (Wingham et al., 2006).\n\nTo measure the arrival angle, a second antenna receives the radar echo simultaneously. When the\necho comes from a point not directly beneath the satellite, there is a difference in the path length of the\nradar signal, which is then measured. Geometry then provides the angle between the baseline joining\nthe two antennas and the echo direction. In addition to the altimeter signal, a precise knowledge of the\norientation of the baseline is required for the SAR height retrieval. CryoSat measures this baseline\norientation using three star trackers mounted on the antenna support structure, which collects five\npictures per second for comparison with the onboard star catalog.\n\nThis allows an accurate SIRAL antenna orientation, but there is also a need for accurate orbital height\ninformation for the accuracy of the altimeter height measurement. To achieve this level of orbital\naccuracy, CryoSat carries two systems: the DORIS and a laser retroreflector. DORIS detects and\nmeasures the Doppler shift in radio signals broadcast from a network of more than 50 radio beacons\naround the world. While the highest positional accuracy is obtained only after ground processing, it also\nprovides a real-time, onboard estimate. A French system developed for the operation of radar altimeters,\nDORIS has been successfully deployed on a number of altimetric satellites. The laser retroreflector has\nseveral corner tetrahedrals, which reflect light in exactly the direction it came from. A global network of\nlaser tracking stations fire short laser pulses at the satellite and times the interval before the pulse arrives\nback at the ground station. These two systems provide independent measurements of orbital height\naccurate to about 2.6 cm.\n\nThe design minimizes the effect of thermal distortion when the antennas are used as an interfer-\nometer. The bench and waveguide materials provide a very low thermal expansion coefficient and the\nradio frequency unit (RFU) location minimizes the waveguide length. Heat from the RFU and the\ndigital processing unit (DPU) is dissipated by the radiator that forms the very front of the spacecraft. In\nflight, the entire system is wrapped in multilayer insulation, while thin sheets of germanium-coated\nkapton cover the antenna reflectors to reduce the effect of asymmetric solar heating.\n\nThe use of the antennas on reception, the timing of the transmitted chirps, and the transmitted\nbandwidth depend on the operating \u201cmode.\u201d There are three operating modes: \u201clow resolution\u201d mode\n(LRM), \u201csynthetic aperture\u201d mode (SARM), and \u201csynthetic aperture interferometric\u201d mode\n(SARInM). LRM provides for conventional, pulse-limited altimetry using a single antenna. SARM\n\n11.5 CRYOSAT INSTRUMENTS 775\n\n\n\nprovides for along-track aperture synthesis using a single antenna. SARInM allows for along-track\naperture synthesis using two antennas and for phase comparison (interferometry) between the\nechoes received on each antenna. The SARM and SARInM are collectively referred to as high-bit-rate\nmodes.\n\nIn LRM, the instrument operates with a pulse-repetition frequency (PRF) of 1.971 kHz. In LRM,\n128, 8-bit samples are formed at a sampling rate of 0.35 ms (only 44.8 ms of the echo is recorded, which\nreduces the measurement bandwidth to 320 MHz). A complex spectrum sampled at 22.3 kHz is formed\nfrom these samples via a fast Fourier transform (FFT), and the spectrum is power detected. Ninety-one\nconsecutive echoes are accumulated (to reduce speckle noise) and passed to the logic (the tracker) that\nprovides closed-loop control of the timing of the deramp chirp and the receiver gain. These same,\naveraged \u201cspectral domain\u201d echo powers also form the measurement (i.e., the telemetered) data of the\nLRM mode. With these parameters, the LRM measurement and tracking spectrum spans a \u201crange\nwindow\u201d of 60 m with a range resolution (sampling interval) of 0.46875 m.\n\nThese LRM measurements are those of a conventional pulse-limited altimeter, except that (for\nreasons of launcher accommodation) the antennas are slightly narrowed in the along-track direction,\nresulting in a slightly asymmetric antenna pattern. At the nominal altitude the LRM signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) is 8 dB when the system is operated over a uniform spherical surface of an Earth radius,\nand backscattering coefficient of ?10 dB. The antennas are linearly polarized with an orientation\nparallel to the interferometer baseline.\n\nIn SARM, the same receive chain is used, but the mode differs in the timing of its transmissions and\nthe formation of the measurement data. The pulses are transmitted in groups \u201cbursts,\u201d of 64 pulses with\na PRF of 18.182 kHz. During a burst, the carrier phase is locked to the transmission timing so that the\ntransmissions within the burst are coherent. Each burst is transmitted with a burst-repetition frequency\n(BRF) of 87.5 Hz. The length of the burst, 3.6 ms, and the interval between the bursts, 11.7 ms, are\nsufficient for the echoes from a transmitted burst to be sent via the duplexer to the receive data before\nthe next burst is transmitted (a \u201cclosed\u201d burst arrangement).\n\nDuring the reception of a burst, the timing of the deramp chirp is held constant (to avoid introducing\ndifferential phase shifts between the transmissions of the burst). As in the LRMmode, echoes are power\ndetected and accumulated (over 46.7 ms) to provide closed-loop control. However, in contrast to the\nLRM, the measurement data comprise the 128 \u201ctime domain\u201d samples of each individual echo, directly\nfrom the A/D converters. As with the LRM, the SARM tracking spectrum spans a range window of 60 m\nwith a range resolution of 0.469 m, as will the measurement spectrum, once the data are processed on the\nground.\n\nFor the SARInMmode, a 350 MHz, 64 pulses, 18.182 kHz PRF burst is again transmitted, but with\na lower BRF of 21.4 Hz. The echoes are directed by the duplexer to the two receive chains. The timing\nof the deramp chirp is identical for each chain (so as not to introduce differential phases between the\ntwo receive chains). In contrast to SARM, the sampling interval at the A/D converters is reduced to\n0.0875 ms and 512, 8-bit samples are generated for each receive channel. The SARInM measurement\ndata comprise these time-domain samples of each individual echo from each receive channel, directly\nfrom the A/D converters. The decrease of sampling interval means that the SARInM spectrum spans a\nrange window of 240 m with a range resolution of 0.469 m, once the data are processed on the ground.\n\nIn contrast to the LRM and SARMmodes, the SARInMmeasurement data are not used to inform the\nclosed-loop control of the instrument. Instead, the longer interval (46.7 ms) between the measurement\nbursts is employed to transmit 40 MHz bandwidth pulses. The echoes from these pulses are received on a\nsingle channel, sampled at 0.35 ms, passed through the FFT, power detected and accumulated over the\n\n776 CHAPTER 11 CRYOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\n46.7 s interval. The resulting average, spectral-domain power provides for the closed-loop control of the\ninstrument. This spectrum spans a range window of 480 m with a resolution of 3.75 m. This arrangement\nprovides the SARInM with a tracking range window larger than that of the measurement range window\n(480 vs. 240 m) to provide for robust closed-loop control over various regions of the Earth, such as\nsignificant topographic changes.\n\nSIRAL also has an acquisition mode that is used to initialize the closed-loop control and two\ncalibration modes. One mode calibrates the DPUwhile the other calibrates the RFU for the deramp chirp\ntiming and the receiver gain, intraburst phase rotations (which provide phase calibration to the aperture\nsynthesis) and the SARInM phase differences as functions of frequency and automatic gain control\n(AGC) setting. A 64-pulse burst is directed through an attenuating connection between the transmission\nand receive chains to achieve this. The deramp chirp frequency is offset to allow the calibration to\nbe made at 11 frequencies lying within the measurement spectrum. The other calibration mode provides\ndetailed corrections for the variations of receiver gain across the measurement spectrum. It is\nimplemented by averaging repeated measurement of the noise power in the absence of a transmission.\nFinally a second calibration path is included to provide at a single frequency a SARInM phase difference\ncalibration that includes the duplexer. This calibration is not a separate mode, but is performed with a\nrepetition frequency of 1 Hz from within the SARInM. It provides a correction for phase difference as a\nfunction of time; the total phase difference correction (a function of frequency, AGC setting and tie) is\nobtained by combing all of these calibration procedures into a single value.\n\n11.5.1 CRYOSAT ORBIT\nCryoSat operates from a near circular, near polar orbit with an average altitude of 717.2 km, and an\neccentricity of 0.0014. The orbit inclination is 92 degrees, which is a compromise between the desire\nto achieve a high density of orbit crossovers at high latitudes (for land/ice altimetry), while having\nmore-or-less complete coverage of the Arctic Ocean and the Antarctic continent. The repeat period is\n369 days with a 7.5 km intertrack spacing at the Equator, which provides a high orbit crossover density\n(10 crossovers/km2 per year at 87 degrees). The orbit also has a 30-day subcycle, which provides\nuniform coverage of the Arctic sea ice every 30 days.\n\nThe attitude of the platform and the SIRAL instrument is measured with three independent star\ntrackers. The trackers are mounted on the zenith side of the SIRAL optical bench to provide as accurately\nas possible the attitude of the bench and hence the SIRAL instrument. Two other attitude sensors are\nmounted on the platform: a coarse EartheSun sensor and two three-axis magnetometers (which can\nprovide attitude and attitude rate change relative to the geomagnetic field). Satellite attitude control is\nprovided by three magnetotorquers, which provide torques about axes orthogonal to the direction of the\nmagnetic field. In addition, there are 16, 10 mN attitude control thrusters, fed by the cold gas system. The\ncold gas system is also responsible for the initial acquisition of the orbit following launch, and for other\norbit maneuvers such as collision avoidance. Because CryoSat is limited to a cold gas system, the usage\nof the fuel is an important factor in the total lifetime of the mission.\n\n11.5.2 CRYOSAT ERROR BUDGET\nErrors that arise from CryoSat measurements may be classified into one of three kinds. First there are\nthose that arise from the measurement system itself (e1b). Fluctuations arising from radar speckle give\nus an example. Second, errors arise because they are being used to transform the point measured radar\n\n11.5 CRYOSAT INSTRUMENTS 777\n\n\n\ndata to point geophysical quantities, such as elevation (e2). Finally, errors (eh1) arise in higher-level\nproducts when forming local averages due to the sampling. Errors e1b and e2 describe errors of\ncommission and eh1 errors of omission. A summary of the overall errors is given here in Table 11.1.\n\nThese errors are the \u201csingle-shot\u201d contributions associated with thew20 Hz measurements. It is of\ninterest to compare the performance of Table 11.1 with conventional ocean, pulse-limited altimetry, for\nwhich a 2-cm range precision of a 1-s average is typical. Were the SARM used for this purpose, the\nequivalent figure for the range precision is 2.6 cm, which is about the same level of performance.\n\nIt must be remembered that CryoSat has difficulty measuring sea ice concentration in very thin sea\nice and this represents a fundamental limitation to this measurement system. As a result, it is best to\ncombine as many different satellite systems as possible to estimate theMYand FY sea ice concentrations\nand extents.\n\n11.6 USING SCATTEROMETRY TO COMPUTE SEA ICE CONCENTRATION\nAND DRIFT\n\nCryospheric applications of scatterometry include mapping of global snow cover, sea ice extent, sea\nice motion, classification of sea ice types, estimate of snow accumulation, and deriving the direction of\nthe wind patterns. Most of these applications have to do with sea ice and sea iceederived properties.\nApplication to geographic regions range from Greenland to Antarctica.\n\nDr. David Long and his students at Brigham Young University (BYU) have used data from the\noperational satellite scatterometers to estimate sea ice concentration and to classify both FYand MY sea\nice. As compared to the regional ice charts produced by the Canadian Ice Service, the difference is found\nto be only 6% for the Arctic winters of 2006e07 and 2007e08. For these periods, it was found that\nmicrowave backscatter produces more temporally stable results than passive microwave brightness\ntemperature introduced earlier in this chapter. In other studies, Kwok (2004) used Ku-band backscatter\nfrom the SeaWinds instrument on QuikSCAT to classify Arctic FYand MY sea ice. In a separate study,\nNghiem et al. (2006) classified Arctic sea ice as seasonal (FY), perennial (MY), and mixed.\n\nThe BYU method uses a seasonally varying threshold to discriminate between FY and MY sea ice\nduring winter. Similar to the previous studies, backscatter measurements from the SeaWinds instrument\naboard the QuikSCAT satellite are used to classify Arctic sea ice as either FYor MY. This classification\nis derived from observed trends in SeaWinds measurements over a period of 7 years. The resulting\nclassification indicates that the coverage of MY ice has reduced from year to year relative to the FY ice\nbetween 2003 and 2009 as it has been reported by other studies.\n\nTable 11.1 Instrument System Contributions to the Elevation Errors\n\nSARInM SARM LRM\n\nOrbit error (cm) 6\n\nRange error (cm) 14 10 7\n\nAngle error (cm) 1.5\n\nRMS total 15 11.6 9.2\n\nLRM, low resolution mode; RMS, root mean square; SARInM, synthetic aperture interfero-\nmetric mode; SARM, synthetic aperture mode.\n\n778 CHAPTER 11 CRYOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nQuikSCAT measurements were processed by the BYU group using the scatterometer image\nreconstruction (SIR) algorithm. The resulting images have a nominal pixel resolution of 4.45 km with\nan estimated effective resolution of w8e10 km. The daily SIR images are produced in a polar\nstereographic map projection. To derive ice classifications a mask is applied to remove scatterometer\nmeasurements over ocean and low sea ice concentrations where water dominates. Data from the\nadvanced microwave scanning radiometer of NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) were\nselected for this purpose, which provided an independent compliment to the QuikSCAT data. AMSR-E\nprovides measurements over six frequencies ranging from 6.9 to 89.0 GHz. Data are collected for both\nhorizontal and vertical polarization resulting in a total of 12 channels of passive microwave radiometer\ndata. The AMSR-E overlay allowed them to also exclude data from the marginal ice zone (MIZ) where\na mixture of sea ice and open water result in confused backscatter signals. Also in the MIZ high winds\ninfluence the backscatter signal making it difficult to isolate high sea ice concentrations.\n\nDaily time series of histograms of AMSR-E 6-GHz V brightness temperatures over the Arctic\nduring 2004 (Fig. 11.8) clearly demonstrates how ice trends can be separated from open-ocean\nthroughout the year.\n\nTo visualize the more detailed information derived from the QuikSCAT backscatter data, they plotted\na series of histograms for the winter of 2006e07 where sea ice was selected out for analysis (Fig. 11.9).\n\nThese winter histograms have one large peak at about ?20 dB, which represents the FY ice and\nanother peak at about ?10 dB, which corresponds to the presence of MY sea ice. Clearly the fraction\nof MY ice is far smaller than that for FY ice.\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\nDec\nNov\n\nOct\nSep\nAug\n\nJul\nJun\nMay\n\nApr\nMar\nFeb\nJan\n\n140 160\n180 200 220\n\n240 260\n280\n\nN\nor\n\nm\nal\n\niz\ned\n\n H\nei\n\ngh\nt\n\nBrightness Temperature(K)\n\nOcean\n\nSummer\n\nIce\n\nFIGURE 11.8\n\nDaily time series of histograms of AMSR-E 6-GHz V brightness temperatures over the Arctic during 2004.\n\nHistograms are normalized and exclude measurements over land. The dashed line represents a threshold\n\nseparating modes representative of ocean and ice. The summer melt period is indicated by the solid red line.\n\n11.6 COMPUTE SEA ICE CONCENTRATION AND DRIFT 779\n\n\n\nUsing the backscatter data, trends of FYand MYArctic sea ice were calculated as presented here in\nFig. 11.10. Here it can be seen that the backscatter signature of FY ice in combination with its snow\ncover is seasonally dependent. This pattern approximately describes the behavior of FY ice backscatter\nfor every year between 2003 and 2009. These observations suggest that FY ice backscatter quickly\nmoves to lower values between September and mid-November. It decreases slightly during December\nand January and then gradually moves to higher values until mid-March. After March, the backscatter\nmoves to lower values until June. At that point it is difficult to distinguish the ice types by backscatter\nuntil late September due to ice melting. After September, new ice forms changing the amount of FY ice\npresent. The backscatter of FY ice in Fig. 11.10A seems to stabilize by mid-November. The high\nbackscatter of FY ice just prior to November may be partially explained by the presence of frost\nflowers, which are formed by the deposition of ice directly from the vapor phase. FY ice covered with\nfrost flowers can have backscatter brightness temperatures that are similar to those seen for MY ice.\n\nTrends in MY ice show a move to lower backscatter in the spring into summer with a rapid drop in\nthe summer melt period. Swan and Long (2012) suggest that this drop in backscatter may indicate the\npresence of snow cover during the fall and spring periods.\n\nThe trends observed in sea ice backscatter for FYand MY ice appear to be interannually consistent.\nEach year, there is a clear separation of FY ice and MY ice. These differences suggest a method to\ndiscriminate the FY/MY classification using an average of the yearly distributions. Looking at the\nwinter backscatter, there is a minimum region that separates the MY and FY ice maxima.\n\nA limitation of this classification method is that MY ice can sometimes look like FY ice. Comiso\n(1990) suggested that ice floes near the MIZ that survive the summer melt, often have passive\n\nN\nor\n\nm\nal\n\niz\ned\n\n H\nei\n\ngh\nt 0.015\n\n0.01\n\n0.005\n\n0\n\nMay\n\nApr\n\nMar\n\nFeb\n\nJan\n\nDec\n\nNov\n\n\u201330 \u201325\n \u201320 \u201315\n\n\u201310 \u20135\n0\n\nWinter\n(2006\u20132007)\n\nNormalized Radar Cross Section (?0)\n\nFIGURE 11.9\n\nTemporal series of histograms of QuikSCAT VV backscatter over Arctic sea ice during the 2006e07 winter.\n\nThe white arrow indicates the temporal progression.\n\n780 CHAPTER 11 CRYOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nmicrowave signatures similar to those of FY ice.

At this frequency, for \u201cthin\u201d ice,\nthe brightness temperature is sensitive to the seawater emission, and to the ice layer emission as well,\nfollowing approximately the LamberteBeer law:\n\nI\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 234:1 K\u00fe 133:9 K$e?x=12:7 cm.

As can be clearly seen in Fig. 11.12, the intensity I \u00bc (Tv \u00fe Th)/2\n(Fig. 11.12, bottom) increases with increasing ice thickness and saturates around w50e60 cm.\n\nUsing an evolution of the Kaleschke et al.

Note that these maps do not have to match perfectly the sea\nice cover maps derived by other sensors, or by microwave radiometers at 19 and 37 GHz, because of\nthe different spatial resolution of the instruments, and due to the fact that they are sensing different\naspects of the same phenomena (i.e., at 19 and 37 GHz, even a thin ice is classified as fully covered by\nice, while this is not the case at lower frequencies).\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\nIce concentration\nIc\n\ne \nco\n\nnc\nen\n\ntra\ntio\n\nn \n[%\n\n]\n\nSurface air temperature \u20135\n\n\u201310\n\n\u201315\n\n\u201320\n\n\u201325\n\n\u201330 S\nur\n\nfa\nce\n\n a\nir \n\nte\nm\n\np.\n[\u00b0\n\nC\n]\n\nB\nrig\n\nht\nne\n\nss\n te\n\nm\npe\n\nra\ntu\n\nre\n [K\n\n]\n\n100\n\n150\n\n183\n\n218\n233\n242\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n30\n50\n\nSMOS measurement\nRetrieval model\n\nOct 11 2010 Oct 25 2010 Nov 08 2010 Nov 22 2010 Dec 06 2010\n\nTh\nic\n\nkn\nes\n\ns \n[c\n\nm\n]\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\nFIGURE 11.11\n\n(A) Time series of AMSR-E ice concentration and National Centers for Environmental Prediction surface air\n\ntemperature, and (B) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) observed and modeled brightness temper-\n\nature with the corresponding ice thickness at 77.5?N, 137.5?E.

The idea is to combine the coverage by QuikSCAT for the period 1999e2009 and then to\nextend that with OSCATon to 2014. The result is a 15-year record of scatterometer-based sea MYand\nFY sea ice classification. They used the NASA team sea ice concentration algorithm applied to passive\nmicrowave brightness temperatures to discriminate between sea ice and open water since these targets\nhave similar backscatter properties. Over the 15-year period the MY ice fraction shows a systematic\ndecrease, while the total area of sea ice cover remains constant throughout the winter seasons. Thus,\nFY ice is making up the area lost by the MY ice.\n\nThis progression is best seen in the winter maps of FY and MYArctic sea ice in Fig. 11.14 where\nthe MY ice is shown in white and the FY ice is shown as light blue.\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n260\n240\n\n220\n200\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n\n80\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n\nP\nol\n\nar\nis\n\nat\nio\n\nn \ndi\n\nffe\nre\n\nnc\ne \n\n[K\n]\n\nIn\nte\n\nns\nity\n\n [K\n]\n\nIce thickness [cm]\n\nFIGURE 11.12\n\n(Top) Dependence of polarization difference (Tv ?

In 2014 MY ice recovers slightly and has almost reached the\ncoverage levels of 2005 and 2006.\n\nUnfortunately, the subsequent winter saw an additional decrease in MY sea ice cover as reported by\nthe US National Snow and Ice Data Center in Fig. 11.15.\n\nFIGURE 11.14\n\nWinter Arctic sea ice cover for multiyear (MY) (white) and first-year (FY) (light blue) sea ice.\n\n11.8 MULTIYEAR ARCTIC SEA ICE CLASSIFICATION 785\n\n\n\nAs illustrated in Section 6.4.3.5, GNSS-R techniques also offer the potential to map sea ice extent,\nor to monitor subsurface ice layers down to w200 m, especially in very dry conditions, where the\npenetration depth is larger. The recent launch of the UK TDS-1 satellite with an experimental GNSS-R\npayload onboard has demonstrated the capabilities of this technique, and it has also shown that the\nproducts at different frequencies \u201csee\u201d different things. Fig. 11.16 shows the AMSR2 sea ice concen-\ntration (SIC) maps (left column, data grid 6.25 km) derived using the ASI algorithm applied over\nAMSR2 data, based on the polarization difference of the 89 GHz channel, and the OSI-SAF SIC maps\n(right column, data grid 12.5 ? 12.5 km) generated using the 19, 37, and 91 GHz of the SSMI/S sensor.\nStripes correspond to the ground tracks of the specular reflection points of the GPS signals collected by\nTDS-1 (size of specular reflection zone blurred over the 1 s integration time:w300e400 m ? 6.5 km).\nFig. 11.16A corresponds to November 15, 2014, and Fig. 11.16B to January 27, 2015. Note that,\nalthough there is a general agreement between the GNSS-R data and the well-accepted ASI AMSR2 and\nOSI-SAF algorithms, in the transition zones there are serious disagreements. This is especially true in\nAntarctica on January 27, 2015, where there are large tracks in pink detected as 100% ice, while the\npassive microwave products classify them as 0% ice. This may be due to the different spatial resolutions\nof both techniques and the different electromagnetic frequencies.\n\n11.8.1 GREENLAND ICE SHEET\nA primary concern in present day Earth science research is the question of sea level rise. It is presently\nnot well known if the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are shrinking or growing overall. Greenland\nalone contains enough land ice to raise the global sea level by 5 m if it all melted. The larger ice sheets\nof Antarctica contain enough land ice to raise global sea level by 70 m if melted. The harsh climate of\nthese regions makes in situ measurement campaigns difficult and this adverse weather also influences\nsatellite measurements of mass balance in these areas difficult.\n\nAverage Monthly Arctic Sea Ice Extent\nOctober 1979 - 2015\n\n1994\nYear\n\nN\nat\n\nio\nna\n\nl S\nno\n\nw\n a\n\nnd\n Ic\n\ne \nD\n\nat\na \n\nC\nen\n\nte\nr\n\n1990198619821978\n\nE\nxt\n\nen\nt (\n\nm\nill\n\nio\nn \n\nsq\nua\n\nre\n k\n\nilo\nm\n\net\ner\n\ns)\n\n1998 2002 2006 2010 2014\n\n6.5\n\n7.0\n\n7.5\n\n8.0\n\n8.5\n\n9.0\n\n9.5\n\n10.0\n\nFIGURE 11.15\n\nAverage Arctic monthly sea ice extent estimated by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, Boulder, CO.\n\n786 CHAPTER 11 CRYOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nFIGURE 11.16\n\nSea ice concentration (SIC) maps computed from AMSR2 (left column) and OSI-SAF (right column) for (A)\n\nNovember 15, 2014, and (B) January 27, 2015.

Monitoring snowmelt is critical\nto assessing sea level rise both for its direct contribution and also because it indirectly increases glacial\ndischarge into the sea that also contributes to sea level rise (Zwally et al., 2002). Snowmelt percolates\ndown to the base of the Greenland ice sheet, providing a lubricant between the ice sheet and the\nunderlying ground surface that initiates sliding and accelerates the flow of ice toward the margins of\nthe ice sheet into the surrounding ocean. Scatterometry is useful for measuring the extent of snowmelt\ndue to its extreme sensitivity to the presence of liquid water. As it can be seen in Fig. 11.17 s0 de-\ncreases rapidly with a very small increase in snow wetness, dropping as much as 10 dB with only a 1%\nincrease in wetness.\n\nAt microwave wavelengths, water has a relatively high dielectric constant resulting in the absorption\nof radar pulses, whereas dry snow is a good scatterer of radar energy resulting in higher s0 values. Thus,\nsudden decreases of backscatter have been used to estimate the amount of snowmelt (Wismann, 2000;\nWismann and Boehnke, 1997). These studies have shown that detection of snowmelt with spaceborne\nscatterometry correlates well with the timing of in situ near surface temperatures rising above 0?C\n(Wismann, 2000).\n\nThe other important snow characteristic for ice mass balance is the snow accumulation. It is not yet\ncertain whether or not higher temperatures from global warming might actually increase precipitation\nover Greenland, leading to a higher snow accumulation and hence a growth in the ice sheet. Snow\naccumulation is usually quantified as snow water equivalent (SWE), which is the height of a centimeter\n\nFIGURE 11.17\n\nKu-band backscatter (VV) at 54 degrees for different snow wetness (Nghiem et al., 2001).\n\n788 CHAPTER 11 CRYOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nof liquid water contained in a vertical snow column of 1 cm2. Any relationship between backscatter\nand SWE must be empirically modeled. This is because the density and grain size vary with time and\nare not routinely measured over the entire ice sheet. It is expected that SWE and backscatter are\ninversely related: as the snow layer grows deeper, less of the incident radar energy penetrates down to\nlower layers penetrating to the high radar reflectivity of the firm resulting in lower s0. In addition, an\nincrease in the snow layer contributes more to the volume scattering nature of the snow masking the\nhigher radar reflectivity of the underlying firn resulting in lower s0.\n\nFinally, scatterometer data have been used to map the different facies of the Greenland ice sheet.\nGreenland is conceptually divided into four different facies: the dry zone or accumulation zone which\ndoes not experience any melt throughout the year; the wet snow or percolation zone, which seasonally\nexperience scattered snowmelt that eventually percolates into the underlying firn to be later refrozen\ninto subsurface ice lenses; the saturated snow zone, which seasonally experiences enough melt to\nsaturate the entire snow surface with melt water; and the ablation zone, which completely melts the\nsnow cover each summer, creating numerous surface ponds and lakes and exposes the underlying ice\nelsewhere. These four facies are illustrated here in Fig. 11.18.\n\nThe backscatter of these facies is distinct enough to allow them to bemappedwell using scatterometry.\nAs mentioned earlier, snow tends to decrease s0 as it masks the more intense backscatter from the\nunderlying firn. Thus, dry snow typically has a lower mean s0 as compared to the nearby percolation\nzone, which has less snow cover and relatively high backscatter from buried ice lenses and the sub-\nsurface firn layer. This is particularly true during the late fall and early winter seasons when water is still\npresent in this zone. The saturated and ablation zones look similar to the percolation zone in winter, but\nthey decrease significantly in s0 in summer as the snowmelt begins. Hence the separation between the\ndry snow zone and the percolation zone is most visible in scatterometer images from late fall and early\nwinter as shown here in Fig. 11.19. Some studies have used this mapping technique to map Greenland\nfacies that show the retreat of some parts of the dry snow line toward the higher latitudes and increases in\nthe summer melt extent (Drinkwater et al., 2001; Drinkwater and Long, 1998).\n\nWet Snow\n\nSaturated Snow\n\nSurface Lakes\n\nBare Ice\n\nFirn\nIce Ienses\n\nFirn\n\nDry Snow\n\nIce\n\nRock\n\nAblation\nZone\n\nWet Snow\nZone\n\nPercolation\nZone\n\nDry Snow\nZone\n\nFIGURE 11.18\n\nThe four facies of the Greenland ice sheet (Drinkwater et al., 2001).\n\n11.8 MULTIYEAR ARCTIC SEA ICE CLASSIFICATION 789\n\n\n\n11.8.2 SEA ICE CONCENTRATION AND ICE MOTION\nSea ice is important to climate change due to its high albedo, which deflect solar radiation and prevents a\nsignificant amount of heat from the ocean warming the polar atmosphere. Thus, as the Arctic becomes\nice-free, this albedo effect is sharply reduced. The thickness of sea ice also determines the amount of\ninsulation it provides. Once again scatterometry responds to the surface roughness and changes in\nsurface dielectric, which influences the backscatter amount.\n\nThe basic detection of sea ice is based on the distinct difference between the backscatter from open\nwater and sea ice. The high backscatter from sea ice is so different that it is possible to set a limit in\nbackscatter beyond which one can clearly say the target is sea ice. Classifying sea ice based on its\nthickness is far more difficult. Sea ice is usually classified by its age and can be lumped into the broad\ncategories of MY ice (has persisted beyond a single year and you can have second year, third year, etc.)\nand FY ice, which will form and melt each year.\n\nMY ice is usually very rough at its surface due to wind and wave deterioration over time while FY\nice is generally smooth with some rough areas due to ridging and rafting when ice floes collide. As\nsurface roughness increases the backscatter, response becomes more isotropic and the B value in the\nscatterometer geophysical model becomes greater. MY ice has the highest B values, while ridged FY\nice has intermediate B values and smooth FY ice has the lowest B values. MYand FY ice differ greatly\nin their salinity. Ice formation forms brine pockets and this brine gradually leaks out of the ice thus\nmaking the MY ice fresher than the newly frozen FY ice. Since salinity increases the surface dielectric\nthe ice increases it absorption of the incident microwave energy resulting in lower s0 values.\n\nSea ice concentration can also be estimated using the emissivities at 19 and 37 GHz at vertical\npolarization (e19V, e37V). The method to quantify the iced sea surface percentage consists of measuring\nthe distance a given (e19V, e37V) point to the point (e19V,ice, e37V,ice) for an all ice pixel, normalized to\nthe distance between the all ice (e19V,ice, e37V,ice) and all water (e19V,water,e37V,water) points. There is a\ndifference between the Arctic and Antarctica. In the Antarctic the first-year ice melts every year, to\nfreeze again the next year, while in the Arctic the ice layers can be maintained over the year to form\nmultiyear ice. This translates in an emissivity of approximately 0.92 for the Arctic ice and 0.84 for the\nAntarctic at vertical polarization and 53 degrees incidence angle.\n\nFIGURE 11.19\n\nQuikSCAT backscatter imager over Greenland for days 203, 208, 213, and 218 in 1999 (from left to right),\n\nblue and white colors indicate dry surfaces while red and black indicate wet snow surfaces undergoing melt\n\n(NASA, 2017).\n\n790 CHAPTER 11 CRYOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nComparisons of scatterometer sea ice classifications with those from passive microwave\ninstruments show that the passive microwave instruments (such as the special sensor microwave imagery\nor SSM/I) overestimate the areal extent of MY ice versus FY ice by as much as 12% due to atmospheric\ninterference at the higher frequencies used for these classifications (Voss et al., 2003). The overall ice\ncover is best characterized using a combination of both active and passive microwave sensors.\n\nScatterometry has also proven useful in sensing the date of melt onset and the duration of the melt\nseason (Drinkwater and Liu, 2000; Winebrenner et al., 1998). These studies validated their scatterometer\nderived melt detection by comparing their onset periods with near-surface air temperatures recorded at\nnearby coastal meteorological stations which in both cases showed that the air temperatures increase\nabove 0?C when the sea ice melt begins to be detected in the scatterometry. In a separate study, melt\nponding was detected from a helicopter during the period for which the scatterometer had determined the\nmelt onset (Drinkwater et al., 1998). The melt season can be estimated from the date of melt onset to the\nstart of freeze up which is correlated with a sudden increase in s0.\n\nScatterometer data have also been used to compute sea ice motion. This is done with a sequence of\nice images and a wavelet analysis has been employed in some of these studies. Comparisons with\nin situ sea ice motion from ice buoys have shown that scatterometer sea ice motion has an accuracy of\nabout ?2e3 cm/s in speed and 30 degrees in direction (Zhao et al., 2002; Liu and Zhao, 1999). This\naccuracy is similar to SSM/I derived sea ice speeds and is slightly better that the SSM/I derived sea ice\ndirections (?35e38 degrees). Because passive microwave radiometer and scatterometers respond\ndifferently to ice features (emissivity vs. backscatter), the spatial resolution of each will be different.\nThus, it is best to merge sea ice motions from passive microwave with scatterometer and ice buoy\nmotions to achieve the best possible coverage. In merging these different data sources, a weighted\naverage is used proportional to their respective accuracies. Zhao et al. (2002) used a weighting scheme\nof 1/3, 1/2, and 1/6 to QuikSCAT, buoy, and SSM/I derived sea ice motion vectors, respectively and\nproduced Arctic sea ice motion maps like that in Fig. 11.20.\n\nFIGURE 11.20\n\nSea ice motion (white arrows) from merged NSCAT, SSM/I, and ice buoy data (Liu and Zhao, 1999).\n\n11.8 MULTIYEAR ARCTIC SEA ICE CLASSIFICATION 791\n\n\n\n11.9 ARCTIC SEA ICE DRIFT ESTIMATION BY MERGING RADIOMETER\nAND SCATTEROMETER DATA\n\nIn a separate study, Girard-Ardhuin and Ezraty (2012) used a combination of passive microwave\nradiometry from the AMSR-E and the SSM/I along with SeaWinds/QuikSCAT and ASCAT\nscatterometry to estimate sea ice motion in the Arctic during the summer melt and transition season\n\u201cfreeze up\u201d periods. Independent validation of their motion results was provided by the International\nArctic Buoy Project buoys which give excellent ice movement information which is limited in spatial\ncoverage by the relatively low number of buoy deployed across the Arctic. In their method the individual\nsensors were used separately to compute ice motion for the entire Arctic before any attempt at merging\nthe resulting vectors was carried out. Thus, the goal of this study was to merge the resulting ice drift\nmaps resulting from the use of the radiometer and scatterometer instruments individually.\n\nPassive microwave radiometers, such as the SSM/I, have been used with substantial success to\ncompute sea ice motion for many years. Able to see through the clouds the microwave data provide\nmuch better overall coverage along with a reduction in spatial resolution. Passive microwave imagery\nalso operates both day and night with the same level of responsiveness. To minimize all atmospheric\neffects the ice motion is best calculated in the winter when that atmosphere is very dry. Microwave\nchannels can be selected to minimize the influence of water vapor such as the Ka- and Ku-bands (19\nand 37 GHz).\n\nWhile several different methods have been used to compute sea ice motion in sequential imagery,\nthe method selected in this research was the familiar maximum cross correlation (MCC; Emery et al.,\n1991). This method has been widely used and well validated in the literature. In this application a\ncorrelation threshold of 0.6 was used to filter out spurious vectors computed from the pair of images.\nThe final spatial resolution was 12.5 km and an 11 ? 11 pixel correlation array was used.\n\nA time lag of 2e3 days was used for the MCC calculations, which is much longer than the less-\nthan-one-day lag that should be used for sea ice drift in the Antarctic. For this 2e3 day lag period\nand the 12.5 km spatial resolution the minimum displacement for the MCC method is 6.25 km, which\ncorresponds to a velocity of 7 cm/s. This is the same order of magnitude of the mean velocity for the\nbuoy displacements measured over a winter. ASCATand QuikSCAT data are also used for sea ice drift\nestimation using the same grid that we developed for SSM/I and AMSR-E.\n\n11.10 MERGING THE SEA ICE DRIFT PRODUCTS\nThe main steps of merging the individual sea ice drift products are initialization phase, selection of a\ndrift vector, and quality control. At any one-grid node, there are 14 possible cases ranging from a triplet\nof identical vectors to a single vector. Weights have to be given to all of these vectors at the grid point\nso that the weighted average can be computed for that grid point. The weight depends on the selection/\nquality control procedure and on the selected sensor or channel. Minimum weights are given to the\nscatterometer vectors. The cases where several drift vectors exist at a grid point are treated differently\nthan at a grid point where only a single vector is present. Both cases use information from the\nsurrounding grid points to produce a smooth resultant grid function.\n\n792 CHAPTER 11 CRYOSPHERE APPLICATIONS\n\n\n\nAn example of a merged sea ice motion field is presented here in Fig. 11.21 for April 24 and 27,\n2007. Colors of the arrows correspond to the merged processing for each pixel: in red, the three es-\ntimations are identical (scatterometer and radiometer H and V polarizations), in green, two of the three\ndrifts are identical, in blue, one channel has been chosen. The sea ice drift patterns are moving from\nday-to-day, and Fig. 11.21 presents a pattern, which is considered a \u201cclassical\u201d drift pattern in the\nBeaufort gyres, a southward drift in Fram Strait, and the ice export out of the Kara Sea.\n\nThe validation of the merged sea ice drifts is based on data from five winters. The standard\ndeviation of the difference to buoy displacements is 7.5 km. When converted to speed the mean\nvelocity is 2.91 cm/s, which is similar to the buoy mean velocity of 2.6 cm/s. These results include\nsmall ice drifts where the MCC method is known to break down. Previous studies have made similar\ncomparisons while excluding speeds below a certain threshold.\n\nFIGURE 11.21\n\nArctic sea ice drift map from independent maps of drift vector from SSM/I H and SSM/I V polarization\n\nchannels, and SeaWinds/QuikSCAT. The time lag is 3 days: April 24e27, 2007. Drift vectors less than one\n\npixel are marked by a cross. Identical drift vectors for the three estimates is colored in red; identical drift\n\nvectors for any two of the estimates is colored in green; selection or validation of any single drift vector is\n\ncolored in blue. Note that the arrows are not at the scale of the map.\n\n11.10 MERGING THE SEA ICE DRIFT PRODUCTS 793\n\n\n\nAs expected, the angles of the drift vectors computed with the MCC method, exhibit a strong\nuncertainty for small drifts relative to the buoy drift directions. For comparisons including all drift\nvectors the standard deviation of the angle difference is 39.2 degrees; if drifts less than one pixel are\nexcluded this reduces to 29.6 degrees. Thus, excluding small drifts significantly improves the angular\naccuracy. Fig. 11.22 presents the angle difference between the merged product and buoys as a function\nof merged drift magnitudes. The angle difference decreases sharply for drift magnitudes higher than\n40 km (about three pixels).\n\nMonitoring ice over land is also very important. Glaciers store 75% of Earth\u2019s freshwater and are\nsensitive indicators of long-term climate changes. Glacier extension and motion can also be precisely\nmonitored using three different techniques:\n\n\u2022 Repeated optical or SAR intensity satellite imagery by feature tracking (e.g., Willis et al., 2011;\nHerman et al., 2001), which requires accurate coregistration of the images, visible structures to be\ntracked, and enough displacement between data acquisitions in terms of the spatial resolution, so\nthat they can be tracked. This is illustrated in Fig. 11.23 using a pair of TerraSAR-X images.\n\n\u2022 Coherence (a measure of the similitude) tracking, which is based on the same principle and SAR\nintensity feature tracking, can work in smaller image regions with low texture, but may fail in\nareas of high speed, where coherence is lost.\n\n\u2022 Differential SAR interferometry, in which two pairs of images in ascending and descending\npasses (to have two nonparallel displacement vectors), are used to calculate the interferograms\n(phase differences) from which the velocity fields can be calculated.\n\n\u2013200\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\u20134.0\u20133.0\u20132.3\u20132.0\u20131.3\n\n120\n\n\u2013100 0\nangle diff (degrees)\n\nM\ner\n\nge\nd \n\ndr\nift\n\n (k\nm\n\n)\n\n100 200\n\nFIGURE 11.22\n\nAngle difference between satellite merged drift vectors and buoys drift vectors as a function of the merged\n\ndrift magnitude.

It was an\naluminum sphere of just 58 cm diameter and 83 kg of mass (Fig. 12.1A). Following Sputnik-1 and -2,\nExplorer-1 was the first US satellite (Fig. 12.1B). It was launched on January 31, 1958, from Cape\nCanaveral. Explorer-1 was about 205 cm long and 15 cm in diameter and weighted 13.4 kg.\nVanguard-1 was the fourth artificial satellite in orbit (Fig. 12.1C). It was launched on March 17, 1958,\nfrom Cape Canaveral. Vanguard-1 was a sphere of just 16 cm, with a mass of 1.6 kg, and it was the first\nsolar-powered satellite. The first radio amateur satellites also date from the early 1960s. The first\n\u201cOrbiting Satellite Carrying Amateur Radio\u201d OSCAR-1 (Fig. 12.1D) was designed and developed by a\nCalifornia-based group of radio amateurs, and it was launched on December 12, 1961, from\nVandenberg Air Force Base. It was a parallelepiped of approximately 30 cm ? 25 cm ? 12 cm,\nbattery-powered, and with a mass of 4.5 kg.\n\nDuring the first two decades of the space age, each satellite had its own design in terms of shape,\nmass, size, stabilization methods, power, instrument mounting, onboard data handling, communica-\ntions, etc. Standard spacecraft buses were practically unknown until the end of the 1970s. In the early\n1980s microsatellites1 emerged and, as compared to traditional spacecrafts, adopted a radically\ndifferent design approach to reduce costs, focusing on available and existing technologies, and using\n\u201ccommercial off-the-shelf\u201d (COTS) components. The definition of the \u201csmall satellite mission\nphilosophy\u201d now implies a design-to-cost approach, with strict cost and schedule constraints, mostly\ncombined with a single mission objective so as to reduce the mission complexity and the associated\nmanagement costs. To a large extent, this has been possible in the past decades thanks to the advances\nin electronic miniaturization and its associated performance. The appearance of new small launchers,\nfor example, through the use of modified military missiles, and new companies such as Space X have\nalso facilitated the access to space to many countries or even research institutes and universities.\nTable 12.1 from nanosats.eu (2016) summarizes the main launch providers as of October 2016.\n\nSmall satellite missions offer today a number of advantages such as more frequent mission\nopportunities, larger variety ofmissions and potential users, faster expansion of the technical and scientific\nknowledge base, and greater involvement of local and small industry (Kramer and Cracknell, 2008).\n\nCHAPTER\n\n1Microsatellite is a satellite with mass between 10 and 100 kg.\n\nIntroduction to Satellite Remote Sensing. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809254-5.00012-9\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The goal was to allow graduate\nstudents to conceive, design, implement, test, and operate in space a complete spacecraft, often using\nCOTS components. Because of the simplicity of the CubeSat \u201cstandard\u201d (CubeSat Developer\nResources, 2016), which only defines the outer envelope, it ended up becoming a \u201cde facto\u201d standard.\nThe first CubeSats were launched in June 2003 on a Russian Eurockot. While originally, CubeSats (now\ncalled one unit or 1U CubeSats) were nanosatellites2 of roughly a 10 cm ? 10 cm ? 10 cm cube, with a\nmass smaller than 1.33 kg; soon other form factors were developed to accommodate larger payloads and\n\n(A) (B)\n\n(D)(C)\n\nFIGURE 12.1\n\nImages of the first USSR and US satellites (A) Sputnik-1 (Sputnik, 2012) and, (B) Explorer-1 (Howell, 2012),\n\nimage of (C) Vanguard-1, the first solar-powered satellite (Pics about space, 2016), and (D) OSCAR-1 (OSCAR\n\n1, 2, 2016).\n\n2Nanosatellite is a satellite with mass between 1 and 10 kg.\n\n798 CHAPTER 12 REMOTE SENSING WITH SMALL SATELLITES\n\n\n\nTable 12.1 Main Nanosatellite Launch Providers, Programs, and Prices\n\nProvider Number Launched\nFirst\nLaunch Cost Additional Information\n\nTerran\nOrbital/\nTyvak\n\n121\u00fe (40\u00fe planned) 2003 CubeSat integrator for most\nUS Gov.

The current CubeSat Design Specification (CDS rev. 13\n[CubeSat Developer Resources, 2016]) defines the envelopes for 1U, 1.5U, 2U, 3U, and 3U \u00fe form\nfactors, and a provisional CDS for 6U CubeSats has also been issued. Fig. 12.2 shows the CubeSat\nstructures corresponding to 1U, 2U, 3U, 6U and the planned 12U (Radius Space, 2016).\n\nMost CubeSats are nowadays either used as technology demonstrators, without the cost of a larger\nsatellite, or to perform \u201crisky\u201d small scientific experiments. Biological research payloads have also\nbeen flown on several missions, and there are even several missions planned to the Moon and Mars\n(Gibney, 2016).\n\nFig. 12.3 shows the predicted number of nano- and microsatellite launches by mass. It is expected\nthat the 1e3 kg nanosatellite segment (mostly 1U CubeSats) will grow at a 3% compound annual\ngrowth rate (CAGR) over the next decade, with over 500 1U CubeSats to be launched by 2024. Despite\nthis growth, the single most active small satellite segment is expected to be 3e10 kg nanosatellite\n\nFIGURE 12.2\n\nCubeSat size comparison.\n\nFrom https://www.nasa.gov/content/what-are-smallsats-and-cubesats.\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024\n\nNanosats: 1\u20133 kg Nanosats: 3\u201310 kg Microsats: 10\u2013100 kg\nSource : NSR\n\n# \nS\n\nat\nel\n\nlit\nes\n\nFIGURE 12.3\n\nGlobal satellite launches by mass (Belle, 2015).\n\n800 CHAPTER 12 REMOTE SENSING WITH SMALL SATELLITES\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/content/what-are-smallsats-and-cubesats\n\n\nplatforms up to 6U, while larger 10e100 kg microsatellite platforms are the most rapidly growing, at a\n14% CAGR (Belle, 2015).\n\nBy 2014, the 3U CubeSat had become the most popular form factor in the market, due to the\ndeployment of the Planet (www.planet.com) and Spire (https://spire.com/) constellations. This form\nfactor is still dominating the scene (Fig. 12.4), and constellations of 3U CubeSats will sustain activity\nthrough the next decade. However, it is expected that the next wave of growth will be based on 6U and\n12U CubeSats (Fig. 12.2), which achieve a balance between very capable payloads, and limited\nmanufacturing and launch costs, leveraging the benefits of standardization (Belle, 2015). While in the\nearly space age small satellites were simply ignored or overlooked by industry, space agencies, and\nthe media, the international radio amateur community and associated universities must be regarded as\nthe true pioneers of small satellite technology.\n\n12.2 EARTH OBSERVATION USING CONSTELLATIONS OF SMALL\nSATELLITES\n\nSince the review by Selva and Krejci (2012) the capability to perform many real science mission using\nsmall satellites has become a reality. Table 12.2 from Freeman et al. (2016) summarizes the main areas\nin which technology has matured enough so as to enable new types of Earth observation missions that\nwere not feasible in 2012.

Fig. 12.5 graphically summarizes the\ntemporal and spatial requirements for some applications (Sandau and Brieb, 2008).\n\nWhile achieving submetric resolution will be a big challenge for CubeSat-like small satellites,\nachieving a metric or decametric resolution is nowadays feasible. For example, Planet (www.planet.\ncom) is achieving 3.7 m resolution with a constellation of 3U CubeSats named \u201cDove\u201d (see\nFig. 12.6). The advantage of this much faster turnaround time of Earth imagery for commercial and\nhumanitarian applications is the most important application for most constellations of small satellites\n(Foust, 2013, 2014).\n\nTable 12.2 Technological Feasibility of Different Earth Observation Missions Using Small\nSatellites\n\nTechnology\nSelva and Krejci\n(2012) Freeman et al.

Spire provides temperature, pressure, and water vapor content through GPS Radio Occultation\n(GPS-RO) data. These data are relied upon for weather forecasts. These data are gathered using a\nconstellation of 3U CubeSats and are under evaluation for future commercial procurement to be used\noperationally in NOAA\u2019s weather forecast. The first four of Spire\u2019s \u201cLEMUR-2\u201d class satellites were\nlaunched piggy-back on a PSLV-XL rocket in 2015. The second batch was launched with Cygnus\nCRS-6 to the ISS. Four of the satellites to be deployed from the ISS airlock, five of them directly from\nthe NanoRacks NRCSD-E deployer on the Cygnus vehicle. Deployment of the ISS satellites began on\nMay 18, 2016, and the satellites on Cygnus were deployed on June 21, 2016. During the following\nOA-5 mission, which departed the ISS on November 21, 2016, four additional LEMUR-2 satellites\nwere released from another Cygnus vehicle after it raised its orbit to an altitude of 500 km prior to a\nplanned reentry November 27, 2016 (Foust, 2016). At the end of May 2017, Spire has launched a total\nof 36 satellites, from which 21 are still in orbit. Spire aims to launch new and upgraded satellites\nnearly every month, which will also include ADS-B payloads to track airplanes by the end of 2017\n(LEMUR-2, 2016) (see Fig. 12.7).\n\nA third example is the constellation of Arkyd-100 satellites, 12U CubeSat-compliant, from\nPlanetary Resources (PlanetaryResources_1, 2016) offering visible-NIR 40 channel hyperspectral\nimagery with 10 m resolution, and mid wave infrared imager (MWIR) in 3e5 mm with 15 m\nresolution. It is claimed that these imagery cannot only be used for Earth observation, but for asteroid\nprospecting, in view of future space mining (PlanetaryResources_2, 2016).\n\nTable 12.4, extracted from nanosats.eu (2016) shows the main Earth observation constellations. It\nis worth noting that among the top 18 constellation projects, 7 correspond to Earth observation, and the\nfirst 5 positions are occupied by the three projects listed above. Still, a major challenge for high-\nresolution imaging missions or for hyperspectral missions on small spacecraft is the thermal stabil-\nity of the imaging instrument and the attitude stability of the bus.\n\nFIGURE 12.7\n\nLEMUR-2 satellites carry two payloads: STRATOS GPS radio occultation payload and the SENSE AIS payload.\n\nFrom Gunter\u2019s Space Page, \u201cLEMUR-2\u201d; http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/lemur-2.htm.\n\n12.2 EARTH OBSERVATION USING CONSTELLATIONS OF SMALL SATELLITES 807\n\nhttp://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/lemur-2.htm\n\n\nOther examples of Earth observation missions include the NASA CYGNSS mission (Fig. 12.8)\nwith eight enhanced 6U Cubesats to perform GPS-Reflectometry (GPS-R) and the QB-50 project,\nwhich plans to fly 50 university-built CubeSats on a single rocket in 2017 for technology demon-\nstration and studies of the Earth\u2019s thermosphere. The Dutch company Innovative Solutions In Space\n(ISIS) has developed the payload dispenser to accommodate all 50 CubeSats in a rocket whose total\npayload capacity to LEO is only 220e230 kg.\n\nTable 12.4 Main CubeSat Commercial Earth Observation Constellations\n\nOrganization\n\nLaunched/\nPlanned\nNetwork\n\nFirst\nLaunch\n\nForm\nFactor Field Funding\n\nTechnical and\nComments\n\nPlanet 179/150\u00fe 2013 3U Earth\nobservation\n\n$183\nmillion\n\n29 MP sensor taking\nimages with 3.7 m\nground resolution and\nswath of 24.6 ? 16.4 km\nfrom 475 km altitude.\n\nSpire 17/100\u00fe 2013 3U Weather/\nAIS\n\n$69.5\nmillion\n\nMeasure change in GPS\nsignal after passing\nthrough atmosphere to\ncalculate precise profiles\nfor temperature,\npressure, and humidity.\n\nPlanetary\nresources\n\n2/10 2014 12U Earth\nobservation\n\n$21.1\u00fe\nmillion\n\nVisible-NIR 40 channel\nhyperspectral imager\nwith 10 m resolution.\nMid wave infrared\nimager (MWIR) in\n3e5 mm with 15 m\nresolution.\n\nAstro Digital\n(Aquila)\n\n2/10 \u00fe 20 2014 6U &\n16U\n\nEarth\nobservation\n\nunknown 6U has 22 m resolution\nin RGB and NIR. 16U\nhas 2.5 m resolution in\nRGB, red edge, and NIR\nusing one 70 MP sensor.\n\nHera Systems 0/9e48 2017 12U Earth\nobservation\n\n$4.2\u00fe\nmillion\n\nCapable of 1-m\nresolution with 22-kg\nform factor.\n\nHarris 0/12 2019 6U Weather unknown Immediate access to 3D\nwind data sets from\nHarris-owned\nHyperCubes.

The interested readers are encouraged to read the numerous web pages on these topics, and in\n\nFIGURE 12.8\n\n(A) Technicians with Orbital ATK have installed the first half of the Pegasus XL fairing around NASA\u2019s Cyclone\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The second half is\n\nbeing installed. CYGNSS was launched on the Pegasus XL rocket from Cape Canaveral on December 15,\n\n2016, (B) Artist\u2019s concept of one of the eight Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System satellites deployed in\n\nspace above a hurricane.\n\n(A) Credits NASA/Mark Mackley, from Pegasus XL Payload Fairing Installed on CYGNSS Satellites, November 14, 2016; https://\n\nwww.nasa.gov/image-feature/pegasus-xl-mated-to-l-1011-stargazer-carrier-aircraft; (B) Credits NASA, from CYGNSS inorbit artist\n\nconcept; https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/cygnss-inorbit-artconcept_002.jpeg.\n\n12.3 FUTURE TRENDS IN SMALL SATELLITES 809\n\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/pegasus-xl-mated-to-l-1011-stargazer-carrier-aircraft\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/pegasus-xl-mated-to-l-1011-stargazer-carrier-aircraft\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/cygnss-inorbit-artconcept_002.jpeg\n\n\nparticular the \u201cNano-satellite and CubeSat Database\u201d (nanosats.eu) and the \u201cCubeSat web page\u201d at\nNASA/JPL (CubeSat Era, 2016).\n\nToday, the technology development trends are characterized by: (1) higher performance of micro-/\nnanosatellites buses thanks to developments at component and subsystem level such as onboard\ncomputers, onboard data handling systems to preprocess data onboard and reduce the amount of\ndata to be downloaded, higher speed transmitters, solar arrays, batteries, navigation receivers, etc.,\n(2) higher performance optical payloads suitable for disaster and emergency monitoring, which are\nwith high geometric and radiometric resolutions, and more spectral bands, (3) new passive (bistatic)\nradars using micro-/nanosatellites in formation-flying with an active radar transmitter or using signals\nof opportunity, (4) an explosion of satellite constellations to reduce the revisit time thanks to a decrease\nof the unitary satellite cost, and novel international partnerships to share costs, (5) an increased\nflexibility of the mission operations, (6) the creation of networks of ground stations to increase the\nresponsivity according to user requirements and reduce latency, and (7) standardization of processing\nalgorithms and delocalization of processing centers for near real-time data processing closer and to the\nend-user and better tailored to his needs. In summary, small satellites and their associated networks of\nground-stations will provide faster geospatial data, and with a better match to user needs, improving\nthe response time and the information extraction process for decision makers.\n\nHowever, small satellites will not be the only elements of this change of paradigm in Earth\nobservation. New airborne platforms such as drones and Unmanned Air Vehicles, tethered balloons, or\ndirigible airships will augment the space segment regionally or locally providing extremely high\nrevisit time. At the same time, the fusion of incredible amounts of not-so-remotely sensed data (i.e.,\n\u201cparasensing\u201d as opposed to \u201cremote sensing\u201d) crowdsourced from all available sources, either from\ninterconnected (the IoT or Internet of Things) fixed or mobile geolocated sensors will provide \u201cground\ntruth\u201d of different formats and levels of quality that will pose an incredible engineering challenge, but\nwith the reward of the first truly global, synoptic view of our planet Earth.\n\n810 CHAPTER 12 REMOTE SENSING WITH SMALL SATELLITES\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAckerman, S.A., 1997.
