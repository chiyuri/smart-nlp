Furthermore, all existing space engineer-\ning books focus on analysis. None of them deal with space system synthesis, that is, \nwith the interrelations between all the elements of the space system. This book aims \nto understand the interaction between all the forces, both technical and nontechnical, \nwhich in fl uence the de fi nition of a space system. It refers to the entire system: space \nand ground segments, mission objectives, as well as to cost, risk   , and mission success \nprobabilities. \n\n The early design of a space system is a small but important phase of space system \nimplementation. This is the phase where the most fundamental decisions are taken. It \ndeserves its own text. The early design also requires understanding how the main \nspace system constituents  fi t together. To have this understanding, it is necessary to \nhave not only an analytical perspective but also a synthetic perspective. The analyti-\ncal approach is well covered by many texts, but the synthetic perspective is not. \nBooks with a synthetic perspective are necessary. \n\n This book is aimed at space system engineers. It is their job to design and then \nimplement the space system. They are responsible for ensuring ful fi llment of the \nidenti fi ed users\u2019 needs, end-to-end performance, and coherence between all the sys-\ntem elements, and they need to have an overall perspective of the space system. \nIndeed, they need to have a synthetic view. It will also be of interest to managers who \nrequire an interdisciplinary understanding of space systems and how each element \ninteracts with the others. Experts in speci fi c engineering disciplines reading this book \nwould gain from understanding the overall  fl ow of design and how the different engi-\nneering disciplines interact with each other. It will also be of interest to advanced \nstudents of space system engineering as an overview of spacecraft systems engineer-\ning interactions. The book will be of use to anybody who has some professional \nexperience and is interested in acquiring a generalist perspective over a space system \nas an end-to-end system with all its richness of interactions, both technical and pro-\ngrammatic. On the other hand, this book will not be adequate for students of space \nengineering who have not gone through a previous course on space systems analysis \nand technologies. \n\n Quite exceptionally for a book on space system design, this book has a single \nauthor. I have devoted most of my professional life to the early design of space sys-\ntems, and I have written this book from a generalist perspective, focusing on the \ninteractions of the con fl icting factors that drive the design. This emphasis on the \n\u201csynthetic general perspective\u201d is what justi fi es the single authorship of the book. \nI am not an expert in any of the specialized engineering areas described in the book; \nnevertheless, through my experience in space system overall design, I have become \n\n\n\nvi Introduction to Space Systems\n\na specialist in generalities and a specialist in the interactions of all the engineering \nareas. This generalist perspective is going to be the perspective of the book. \n\n This book, written as it is by a single author, is inevitably biased by my own expe-\nrience. That is, it is richer in examples drawn from Earth    Observation missions than \nfrom other types of space missions. I have, however, included numerous examples \nfrom Space Sciences and some from Space Communications    missions to illustrate \nvarious points of interest. For this same reason, manned missions have not been \ntreated. Earth Observation missions, on the other hand, arguably provide the best \nframework for gaining a thorough end-to-end perspective    of space systems. While \noften addressing complex scienti fi c issues, they always involve the delivery of mis-\nsion products    that elucidate or resolve issues of importance to society. End users of \nthese products frequently utilize the acquired data to make decisions of importance to \nwide sectors of society. Meteorological or environmental monitoring missions are \nclear examples of this. Hence, these kinds of missions must be considered from a \nmyriad of angles beyond those strictly concerned with satellite design. \n\n\n\nvii\n\n   Acknowledgments \n\n This book was produced with the help of a large number of European Space Agency \n(ESA) colleagues, who reviewed the work and provided many valuable suggestions. \nSpecial thanks must go to all my colleagues at the Future Earth    Observation \nDivision \u2013 headed by Pierluigi Silvestrin \u2013 all of whom provided much needed \nencouragement and helpful input. Special thanks are also due to David Simpson from \nAstrium UK (retired), who reviewed the entire text in detail. This allowed me to \nbene fi t from his vast experience of space system design.    \n\n\n\n                       \n\n\n\nix\n\n  Contents \n\nForeword ............................................................................................................. v\nAcknowledgments .............................................................................................. vii\n\n1 Introduction ................................................................................................ 1\n1.1.

The chapter starts with a \ndescription of the aims of the book and provides a justi fi cation for its existence. \nIt continues with the actors and roles involved in the process of starting a new space \nsystem. The next section deals with the generalist \u201carchitectural\u201d perspective that is \nnecessary to de fi ne a space system. The following two sections deal with the evolu-\ntion of the design process   . The  fi rst one discusses the design and implementation of \na space system and the second recalls the names and aims of the phases that are nor-\nmally used to de fi ne a space system. The next section presents what constitutes a \nspace system. The chapter  fi nishes with a brief glossary of terms that are used repeat-\nedly in the book and with a list of recommended supplementary texts. \n\n In addition to the present introduction, this book is structured as follows:\n\n   The  fi rst part of the book describes and analyzes space system design and imple-\u2022 \nmentation. It is divided into the following chapters:\n\n   One chapter is on the science of space system design and implementation. It is  \u2013\na recompilation of the technical/scienti fi c disciplines needed for the proper \ndesign and implementation of space systems.  \n  It continues with two chapters on analysis of system requirements    and  \u2013\nconstraints.  \n  The actual design process    is then considered in two chapters. The  fi rst chapter  \u2013\ndeals with the different factors that in fl uence the design. The second chapter \nexplains in detail the iterative steps necessary to arrive at the  fi nal architecture.     \n\n  A second part of the book analyzes concrete aspects of the space system design \u2022 \nprocess   . It concentrates on the interactions between design decisions and uses \ncontinuously past design examples to illustrate these interactions. This second part \nis divided into the following chapters:\n\n   One introductory chapter divides the design process    into domains.   \u2013\n  The satellite observables    and instruments    domain chapter.   \u2013\n  The orbit, space environment   , and attitude domain chapter.   \u2013\n  The satellite con fi guration    domain chapter.   \u2013\n\n    Chapter 1   \n\n Introduction       \n\n\n\n2 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  The satellite operations    data  fl ow domain chapter.   \u2013\n  The instrument output data  fl ow    domain chapter.      \u2013\n\n  The  fi nal chapter analyzes alternative and low-cost    design and implementation \u2022 \napproaches.    \n\n    1.1.   Aim of the book \n\n This book has two aims:\n\n   To describe and analyze the process needed for the proper design of a space sys-\u2022 \ntem, in order that the reader can understand what is a good system design and how \nto arrive to it.  \n  To describe and analyze space systems not from the point of view of their elements \u2022 \nbut from the point of view of the interrelations between them. That means not from \nthe point of view of system analysis but from the point of view of system synthesis.    \n\n The design process    spans from the highest to the most detailed level but this book \ndeals with the early design phases. The design process that is covered by this book \nbegins with a vague statement of needs by users or sponsors and ends with the deliv-\nery of a comprehensive documentation set. The aim of the documentation shall be to \nenable an informed decision on the actual large-scale industrial project approval or \nrejection. Meyer Rechtin 1  de fi ned system architecture as \u201cthe set of information that \nde fi nes a system value cost    and risk    suf fi ciently for the purpose of the sponsor.\u201d Using \nthis de fi nition of \u201csystem architecture,\u201d this book aims to explore the process of creat-\ning the space system architecture. The output of this architecture de fi nition process \nshall include:\n\n   A clear de fi nition of the mission aims including the identi fi cation of users and the \u2022 \nrequirements    that will be addressed by the designed system  \n  A set of formal documents de fi ning the functional and performance system \u2022 \nrequirements   , both qualitative and quantitative  \n  A description of the proposed system with supporting documentation to demon-\u2022 \nstrate that the described system will ful fi ll the identi fi ed requirements     \n  A description of the design and development approach    in suf fi cient detail to pro-\u2022 \nvide credibility to the cost    and schedule    predictions  \n  Cost and schedule    predictions based on the design selected and on the develop-\u2022 \nment and implementation approach chosen  \n  Mathematical models allowing the derivation of the end-to-end system perfor-\u2022 \nmanc   e in terms understandable for the users    \n\n The process described above occurs before the approval of a fully  fl edged indus-\ntrial program and a small team does it. However, by the time the process is  fi nished \napproximately 90 % of the system costs have been effectively decided and locked 2  \n\n   1   The Art of Systems Architecting, Mark Maier and Eberhardt Rechtin, CRC Press 2000.  \n   2   NASA Systems Engineering Handbook, SP-610S 1995.  \n\n\n\n3Introduction\n\ninto the total. It is a small proportion of the system de fi nition and implementation \neffort but it is an inordinately important one. \n\n In Chapter 5 of the television series produced by Tom Hanks  From the Earth      to \nthe Moon ,    3  the heroes are the engineers. Speci fi cally the script is built around Thomas \nKelly and his team from Grumman, designing and implementing the Lunar Module. \nNevertheless, at the very beginning and at the very end of the episode there are two \nbrief scenes where T. Dolan and J. Houbolt appear. These are the people, who, in \n1959, proposed the concept of a Lunar Module and Lunar Rendezvous   . Originally the \nwhole Apollo Module was designed for landing on the Moon and returning to Earth. \nThis original concept was scrapped due to mass and  fi nancial constraints. Another \ncheaper and more feasible solution was sought, which led to the more risky but \naffordable Lunar Module and Lunar Rendezvous concepts. This ability to think \naround problems, work within constraints, and propose workable solutions made the \nApollo program possible. Houbolt and Dolan deserve their, small but important, \nappearance in the television episode and this book deserves to be written. \n\n To dedicate due attention to the early phases of a project is the safest way to avoid \nlarge problems later. Figure  1.1  provides a summary of cost    overrun as the percentage \nof effort dedicated to the early de fi nition. Projects where enough effort has been dedi-\ncated to early de fi nition have clearly smaller cost overruns.  \n\n This book is complementary to all the other space system engineering books. It \nconcentrates in the interrelations and synthesis that the other books normally do \n\nTotal Program Overrun\n32 NASA Programs\n\nDefinition Percent of Total Estimate\n\nP\nro\n\ng\nra\n\nm\n O\n\nve\nrr\n\nu\nn\n\nR2 = 0.5206\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\nGRO76\n\nOMV\n\nGALL\nIRAS\n\nTDRSS\n\nHST\n\nTETH\n\nLAND76\nARS\n\nMAG\n\nGOES I-M\n\nCEN\nACT\n\nCHA.REC.\n\nSEASAT\n\nDE UARS\n\nSMM\n\nEDO\nERB77\n\nSTS\nLAND78\n\nCOBE\n\nGRO82\nERB88\n\nVOY\nEUVE/EP\n\nULYS\nPIONVEN ISEEIUE\n\nHEAO\n\n0 5 10 15 20\n\nDefinition Percent =\nDefinition $\n\nTarget + Definition$\n\nProgram Overrun =\nActual + Definition$\n\nTarget + Definition$\n\n  Figure 1.1.     Design Cost    Versus Overall Cost (Presentation    by Werner Gruhl Of fi ce of the \nComptroller NASA HQ 1985).       \n\n   3    From the Earth      to the Moon ,    Fifth Chapter, Tom Hanks, Executive Producer, based on  A Man on the \nMoon  by Andrew Chaikin.  \n\n \n\n\n\n4 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nnot cover and does not include information that the other books cover properly. \nFor example, this book is not a good source from which to learn about the different \nmethods used to provide the right thermal environment for a satellite; neverthe-\nless, it is a good source to learn how the thermal design   , the attitude control    sys-\ntem, and the pointing    requirements    of the instruments    and the platform could drive \nin con fl icting directions the attitude control, con fi guration,    and structural stability \nof the satellite. The tool that this book uses for this learning has been the compara-\ntive analysis of previous designs. In line with this desire for a complementary, \ngeneralist perspective, our analysis of the different engineering domains will be \nbrief and will forego the formulas and detailed analytical procedures necessary for \nthe actual design. To compensate for this lack, extensive analysis of the factors and \ninterrelations driving the design are included, illustrated with multiple examples \nfrom both current and past designs. For example, Section   9.7     offers an exhaustive \nanalysis of the geometry of the celestial sphere    around the satellite, including the \ntime-varying orientations and dimensions of the Sun   , the Earth   , observation tar-\ngets, and the surrounding deep space   . What are not included are the formulae \u2013 \nfundamentally orbital mechanics and spherical trigonometry \u2013 needed to calculate \nthese time-varying geometries. This lack of formulae is in line with the comple-\nmentary nature of this book and with its generalist perspective; it does not contain \nthe mathematical formulas that are already included in previous books but concen-\ntrates in understanding the overall context where the mathematical formulae will \nbe applied. \n\n This book considers the space mission design process    as an interactive one. The \ntextbook situation where a clear set of user needs generates a clear speci fi cation    with \na design, which answers the speci fi cation, unfortunately does not exist. The users of \nthe data to be provided by the space mission have always a wide, and sometimes \nconfusing and contradictory, set of desires that can be partially or totally ful fi lled by \ndifferent designs answering different sets of  fi nal performances. These designs will \nhave attached widely different price, risk,    and schedule    tags and would require differ-\nent programmatic approaches   . Furthermore, the scientists, who use, and the political \nsponsor, who pays, will be different entities. The sponsor could have explicit or \nimplicit objectives, and being the source of the funds, these will become increasingly \nimportant to meet. An example of these objectives could be the development and use \nof a speci fi c technology or the execution of the work in a speci fi c country or within \na speci fi c programmatic framework   . \n\n The beginning of this book de fi ned its aim as to arrive to a \u201cproper\u201d space system \ndesign \u2013 but what does this mean? A \u201cproper\u201d design is one which balances all the \ncon fl icting needs coming from the user community and provides a system which \ngenerates reasonable scienti fi c mission output within the affordability and program-\nmatic constraints    established by the program sponsor. The scienti fi c output will be \nde fi ned as reasonable by providing answers to an important set of user needs. The \nsystem design will be made optimal by the correct allocation of functions    and perfor-\nmances to the different elements making up the overall system and by the use of \ntechnologies, designs, and development approaches that  fi ts in the risk    and cost    \npro fi le de fi ned by the sponsor. This implies that the scienti fi c requirements   , the devel-\nopment risks, and the programmatic constrains    shall be considered as a whole and \ngiven the same priority by the designer of the system architecture. This approach is \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n5Introduction\n\ntotally in accordance with the approach outlined in the introduction of Wertz 4   Space \nMission Analysis and Design  that deserves to be quoted literally:\n\n  Space mission analysis and design begins with one or more broad objectives and constraints and \nthen proceeds to de fi ne a space system that will meet them at the lowest possible cost   . Broad \nobjectives and constrains    are the key to this process. Procurement plans for space systems too \noften substitute detailed numerical requirements    for broad mission objectives, To get the most \nperformance for the money spent, we must require of the system only what it can reasonably \nachieve.   \n\n The previous paragraphs establish four principles that are of fundamental \nimportance:\n\n   To consider requirements establishment as part of the iterative design process    and \u2022 \nnot as a separate step. Requirements establishment is not completed prior to the \ndesign process but is a part of it  \n  To design a system that is affordable by prioritizing and negotiating unduly penal-\u2022 \nizing requirements   .  \n  To consider not only mathematical analysis and detailed numerical outputs but \u2022 \nalso to understand nonnumerical factors  \n  To reach a balance of requirements   , constraints, and implementation dif fi culties    \u2022 \n\n The need for \u201cbalance\u201d is acknowledged also by NASA 5 \n  A cost   -effective system must provide a particular kind of balance between effectiveness and cost.   \n\n Indeed this whole book strives toward the understanding of the balance that exits \nin a well-designed system. \n\n In the previous paragraphs the need to consider requirements    as \u201c fl exible\u201d and part \nof the overall design process    has been repeatedly emphasized. Nevertheless, N. \nAugustine rightly pointed out 6  that during the fully  fl edged industrial implementation \nphases the requirements must remain as stable as possible. This is not a contradiction. \nThe mutual adjustment between design and requirements during the space system \narchitectural de fi nition phases    of a space mission must ensure that the meshing of \nidenti fi ed requirements and resulting design is as robust as possible. This will mini-\nmize, ideally reduce to zero, the need to change requirements during the subsequent \nfully funded industrial implementation phases.  \n\n    1.2.   Roles in the architecture de fi nition process \n\n The last section made reference to two participating entities or actors: the user and \nthe  fi nancial sponsor. The distinction of the roles played by the different stakeholders \nin the creation of a space system is key to achieve a proper understanding of the \n\n   4   Space Missions Analysis and Design, James Wertz and Wiley Larson, Space Technology Library, \nSpringer 1999.  \n   5   Nasa Systems Engineering Handbook, SP-610S 1995.  \n   6   Augustine\u2019s Laws Norman Augustine, AIAA 1983.  \n\n\n\n6 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n creation process. The European Space Standard ECSS   -P-001 7  uses the following \nde fi nitions:\n\n   Consumer    is the actor that will use the data output of the space project. It is the \u2022 \nscienti fi c or operational community using the data.  \n  Customer    is the actor that behaves as the agent of the consumer, transforms his \u2022 \nneeds into speci fi cations   , leads the resulting project, and accepts the delivery of \nthe space system. For example, this could be a space agency.  \n  Supplier    is the actor that actually builds the space system. It is the space \u2022 \nindustry.    \n\n Wertz in his  Space Missions Analysis and Design  uses a different division with \nthree actors:\n\n   Sponsor    is the institution that pays for the space project.  \u2022 \n  Developer is the institution that builds it.  \u2022 \n  User/Operator is the institution that uses the output data of the space project.    \u2022 \n\n The differentiation presented by Wertz between sponsor    and user is quite cor-\nrect. In most space programs the stakeholder that pays for the system is not the \nstakeholder that uses and this is an important distinction. This duality is not exclu-\nsive to the space domain; it also exists in the implementation of many government-\nfunded goods and services. This duality makes the process of establishing a space \nprogram also unavoidably \u201cpolitical.\u201d This does not mean that the designer has to \nbe political; indeed it is better if he does not try. A good designer is normally a bad \npolitician. However, the designer has to be aware of the political environment    to be \nable to design a system that will eventually be launched. It must not be forgotten \nthat as stated by Brand Forman in 1990 \u201cif the politics do not  fl y the hardware never \nwill.\u201d \n\n In Europe, once a project is approved and once the industrial organization has been \nestablished, the sponsor does not play a very active role. Nevertheless, in the USA \nthe yearly budgeting process by Congress makes the involvement of the sponsor    a \nrecurrent event during the whole duration of the mission and possible project cancela-\ntion by the sponsor is a permanent danger. \n\n On the other hand, the already mentioned ECSS    standards divide the  fi gure of the \ndeveloper into the pair customer    and supplier   . This division is necessary because \nalmost all space projects are done by the interaction between a space agency that \nrepresent the users and a space industry that actually builds the space system. \nTherefore, this text is going to consider the existence of four actors in the process of \ndesigning the architecture of a space mission. The speci fi c terms to be used are going \nto be the ECSS-recommended terms, but with the addition of Wertz\u2019s proposed spon-\nsor   . The actors to be considered in this text will be the following:\n\n   The sponsor   , the entity that pays for the system and establishes the constraints, \u2022 \ncost    ceiling, desired schedule   , programmatic framework, and any set of appropri-\nate guidelines, to be applied to the implementation of the space system.  \n\n   7   Glossary of Terms European Cooperation for Space Standardization   , ECSS   -P-001, ESA 1997.  \n\n\n\n7Introduction\n\n  The consumer   , the community who uses the output of the system and who \u2022 \n establishes requirements    on the quantity, quality, and mode of delivery of the data \nto be produced by the space system.  \n  The customer   , the entity who represents the interest of the consumer    with respect \u2022 \nto the supplier   , who speci fi es the system, oversees its implementation, accepts and \ncerti fi es it, delivers the system to the consumer, and is responsible to the sponsor    \nfor  fi nishing on time and within the cost    ceiling.  \n  The supplier   , the entity who interacts with the customer   , helps in the preliminary \u2022 \ndesign, performs subsequent detailed de fi nition and development, builds the sys-\ntem, delivers it to the customer, and is paid by him.    \n\n This role of the customer    is actually the role of the \u201cclassical architect   \u201d that inter-\nprets and defends the needs of the consumer    \u2013 and the sponsor    \u2013 with respect to the \nsupplier   . It must be noted that in some situations, the number of actors on the process \ncan be smaller. In almost all the privately funded space projects, the sponsor and the \nconsumer can be one and the same entity. A private company will buy a space system \nto ful fi ll a clear set of company needs. The company, acting as both sponsor and \nconsumer, will de fi ne the required performances and the  fi nancial envelope for the \nprogram. In any project where the needs are clear and they can be ful fi lled with an \nalready available and veri fi ed system, the customer, that means the space agency, may \nnot be needed. The customer is the interpreter and defender of the interest of the \nconsumer with respect to the supplier and he becomes less necessary when the level \nof novelty of the system is low.  A standard system does not need to be the subject \nof the architectural de fi nition discussed in this book; it just needs to be pur-\nchased . For the purposes of this text, the emphasis shall be placed on space projects \nthat have all the actors. Space projects are complex, involve conciliation between \ncon fl icting needs, and involve advancement of the state of the art. This is the reason \nthey need an entity that interacts with both the sponsor and the supplier. This neces-\nsary entity is the customer. In the early 1960s, Europe created the European Launcher \nDevelopment Organisation (ELDO) to develop a launcher   . This organization did not \nhave managerial or technical capabilities to ful fi ll the duties of a customer. ELDO \ntried 11 times to launch a rocket and it failed every time. 8  This proves that it is neces-\nsary to have an entity with managerial and technical know-how, which can act as a \nlink between all the actors who participate in a space mission. This is the role of the \ncustomer. \n\n There is one situation where there are two customers: one of them federating and \ninteracting with the consumers    and another with the supplier   . This is the case of \noperational meteorological missions, where there is a research agency: NASA or \nESA, and an operational agency: NOAA or Eumetsat. The operational agency estab-\nlishes the requirements    after strong interaction with the consumers and transfers these \nrequirements to the research agency that imposes them on the customer   . This \napproach has demonstrated its value for operational meteorological missions, which \nare complex, expensive, and built to last many years. The operational agency is also \nnormally in charge of the day-to-day operation of the certi fi ed in-orbit space system. \n\n   8   ESA Achievements, BR-250, ESA 2005.  \n\n\n\n8 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nThe heavy investment and the complex and long-lasting interfaces with the  consumers \nrequired by these missions justify the division of the customer\u2019s role into these two \nparts. \n\n Similar situations and approaches have existed for centuries: the building of the \nharbor in Malaga in 1550 was a major endeavor for its time. The construction of the \nharbor had:\n\n   The consumer   : the traders and  fi shermen of Malaga  \u2022 \n  The sponsor   : the Spanish Crown which paid for the project and was represented \u2022 \nby a \u201cCorregidor\u201d  \n  The customer   /architect   : provided the overall design, certi fi ed the work, and autho-\u2022 \nrized payments termed \u201cVeedor\u201d  \n  The supplier:    made up of the contractors and subcontractors, who actually built the \u2022 \nharbor    \n\n As in any self-respecting present-day space project the supplier    for the Malaga \nharbor was organized with a prime contractor   , called \u201csobrestante mayor\u201d and with \nsubcontractors   , the \u201cmaestros de obras.\u201d As with many modern projects this project \nexperienced delays and cost    overruns. 9  It is not the case that there is nothing new \nunder the Sun,    10  but there are not as many new things under it as they are often \nadvertised.  \n\n    1.3.   The perspective during the system architecture \nde fi nition phases \n\n This book is written from the central perspective of the customer   . The customer inter-\nprets the desires and needs of the consumer    and transforms them into a set of \nspeci fi cations    with a progressive level of detail and formality. The customer, with the \nhelp of the supplier,    establishes the system architecture, allocating functions to sys-\ntem elements and breaks down the overall performance requirements   , allocating them \nto designated system elements, which contributes to the overall performance. In this \nprocess, the customer re fi nes the needs of the consumer and interacts between the \nsupplier and consumer until user needs, system design, performances breakdown,    and \nfunctions allocation    are balanced and coherent. In parallel the customer will take care \nof the ful fi llment of the programmatic constraints    of the sponsor   ; for example, overall \ncost    caps, acceptable risk   , schedule   , and technologies to be used. Once all the \ncon fl icting interests of the actors have been balanced the overall system architecture \ncan be frozen and the  fi rst comprehensive formal system-level speci fi cation can be \nissued. The overall architecture and the system speci fi cation will derive the detailed \ndesigns and set of speci fi cations for the main system elements. The level of detail \nnecessary for the de fi nition of the system architecture will depend upon the aim \nof arriving at \u201cthe set of information that de fi nes a system\u2019s value, cost and risk \n\n   9   Ingenieria en el tiempo de Felipe II Patrimonio Nacional 2003.  \n   10   Eclesiastes, Cohelet, date of writing unknown.  \n\n\n\n9Introduction\n\n suf fi ciently for the purpose of the sponsor.\u201d This information, which will be delivered \nas documentation to the sponsor and the customer, will allow a well-informed deci-\nsion regarding the implementation of a fully  fl edged and funded industrial develop-\nment for a space project. This step shall and must occur before the project is approved. \nThe customer, acting as a link between the consumer and the supplier, behaves as a \nclassical architect    during the early design phases. The establishment of the architec-\nture of a space system is concerned with proving the feasibility as well as the desir-\nability of the mission for the consumer and sponsor before it becomes a reality. The \narchitecture de fi nition effort strives to provide a balance and compromise between the \nconsumer\u2019s needs, the supplier\u2019s capabilities, and the sponsor\u2019s ability to pay for the \nsystem. Compromise can only be assured by an interplay of activities, which are \ndetailed enough to ensure a well-informed decision to allow the project\u2019s  fi nal \napproval. The architectural design is paramount to achieving a decision to approve a \nproject and it is critical to the overall success of the space system. All these interrela-\ntions are summarized in Figure  1.2 . \n\n As far as detailed design and allocation of functions    and performances to the dif-\nferent system elements is concerned, the generalist perspective of the architect    is also \nfundamental. He is independent of the specialists in charge of the design of the sys-\ntem elements. The system architect    can act as an arbitrator between the specialists \ncontributing to the design process   . Therefore, during the early stages of a space proj-\nect, the customer    has to act with the generalist perspective of the architecture of the \nsystem. The extent to which this system architect\u2019s perspective differs from that of \nthe system engineer    is explored in the prologue of the quoted Maier and Rechtin \nbook, which compares and differentiates the roles of the system architecture de fi nition \nand the system engineering. Quoting again literally from that book: \n\n  The early stages of a space project are indeed a period where situations are often unknown and goals \nare not totally de fi ned. In these stages, there is more synthesis than analysis, the work is performed \nby small teams and the interactions of the Customer    with the User and Sponsor    are strong.   \n\n This means, that the early stages of a project tend more toward \u201cSystem \nArchitecture De fi nition\u201d than toward \u201cSystem Engineering.\u201d According to Table  1.1 , \nwhich is also taken literally from the Maier\u2013Rechtin book:  \n\n The \u201cart\u201d element indicated in the table is absolutely pertinent. The optimal alloca-\ntion of functions    and the optimal identi fi cation of key performance criteria cannot be \nestablished by science and mathematics alone.

The existence of the \u201cpolitical\u201d needs of \nthe sponsor    \u2013 he holds the purse strings \u2013 makes the exclusive use of mathematical \nequations to arrive to the optimal architecture even more inappropriate. \n\n It can be said that a good architecture:\n\n   Ful fi lls needs.  \u2022 \n  Is well balanced.  \u2022 \n  Is affordable.  \u2022 \n  Is elegant.    \u2022 \n\n One of the aims of this book is to develop the sensitivity to recognize a good \narchitecture.  \n\n    1.4.   Design and implementation as a evolving process \n\n In the previous sections, the design process    has been presented as an exercise of bal-\nancing con fl icting needs. This section will provide an introduction to the problem of \nhow the need to balance con fl icting needs evolve over time. \n\n The space system engineer    needs to strive for balance during all the design and imple-\nmentation phases as do the specialist engineers within their areas of interest   . Therefore, \nthe same need recurs at progressively more detailed levels of design and an iterative \nprocess ensues. This is the reason that  fi gures such as the cascade or spiral (Figure  1.3 ) \nhave been produced in the past to illustrate the design process    of complex systems.  \n\n   Table 1.1.

Using this output as the starting point for the next design cycle, progres-\nsively more detailed designs and speci fi cations will then be provided. The earlier \ndesign deals with the key requirements    and the higher-level description of the mission \nbut because this design underwrites the decision for project go-ahead, that means, for \nthe system to be actually built, the higher-level description must also include very \nwell described and analyzed critical subsets, because reliable estimation of project \ncost   , performance, and risk    will require fairly detailed analysis and design of these \ncritical subsets. Each design at level  n  provides information needed to derive the \nspeci fi cation and the starting point for the design at level  n  + 1. That means at each \ndifferent level of design the same problem of design by balancing con fl icting needs \nreappears. At the beginning of the process, the design starts from a functional model \nof the highest level of abstraction. This level of abstraction is progressively reduced \nand more concrete concepts and models are provided. This progressive design pro-\ncess    includes:\n\n   Functional decomposition  \u2022 \n  Physical building blocks with increased level of design granularity  \u2022 \n  Overall design where all the critical elements have been progressively detailed  \u2022 \n  Detail design at all levels    \u2022 \n\n Once that the customer    and supplier    have  fi nalized the design, they control the \nmanufacturing, assembly building, integration, veri fi cation, and  fi nal acceptance of \n\nIdentify Needs \n\nQuantify Goals \nDo Trade Studies \n\nSelect Design \n\nCreate Alternatives \n\nIncrease\nDesign Detail \n\nIncrease\nDesign Detail \n\nQuantify Goals \n\nCreate Alternatives \n\nDo Trade Studies \n\nSelect Design \n\nImplement and Certify \n\n  Figure 1.3.

That means the design process    is \n top-down   , from the whole to the detailed, but the implementation is bottom-up   , from \nthe detailed to the whole, and the overall evolution in time of the system design and \nimplementation can be depicted as a V-shaped process 11  (Figure  1.4 ). The descending \nbranch is a decomposition and de fi nition sequence and the ascending branch is an \nintegration and veri fi cation sequence.  \n\n A sad reality associated with the V-process    is that the  fi rst thing to be designed is \nthe last thing to be veri fi ed and certi fi ed as being designed correctly. Indeed the earli-\nest and the latest stages of a space system implementation have the end-to-end per-\nspective    in common. Once the project is approved, the responsibilities of implementing \nthe space segment and the ground segment    are normally in different projects and \nunder the control of different hierarchies. The satellite system and the ground seg-\nment system engineers will concentrate on the very demanding task confronting each \none of them: to produce their part of the system in line with speci fi cations   , on sched-\nule,    and within the cost    budget. Nevertheless, the system architect    acting during the \nearlier phases of the project has to produce a design where ground and space elements \n fi t nicely together, functionalities are correctly allocated, and where the division of \nresponsibilities is clear. Also, once the satellite is launched, the operations engineer \nhandling the in-orbit satellite has to work with the ground segment and the space seg-\nment as a single entity. That means   , it is at the beginning and at the end of the project \nwhen the consideration of the space and ground elements as part of a larger whole is \n\nManufacturing\nand Assembly\n\nDetailed design\nand Engineering\n\nArea of Interest to this Text\n\nArea of Interest to this Text\n\nImplementation\n\nArea of Special\nInterest to this Text\n\nOperations and\nDiagnosis\n\nTesting certification\nand AcceptanceDetailed Level: n, n+1...\n\nDesign\n\nEvaluation and Disposal\nor Adaptation\n\nClient Needs\nand Resources\n\nInterfaces description\nand System Engineering\n\nConception and\nModel Building\n\nSystem Level\n\n  Figure 1.4.

This is the reason why this is a book about space system design, \nnot about satellite system design. \n\n During the design and implementation process described above, the interest in the \nbalance of con fl icting needs and in interactions between the system elements, which \nare the main subjects of this book, will be pertinent to:\n\n   Activities related to highest-level system engineering during the whole design \u2022 \nand implementation process, i.e., to activities located in the upper part of \nFigure  1.4   \n  Activities related to design at all levels, i.e., activities located in the left part of \u2022 \nFigure  1.4   \n  And especially, to activities related to system-level design, i.e., activities located \u2022 \nin the upper left quarter of Figure  1.4      \n\n    1.5.   Project phases    and project reviews    \n\n Space projects are divided into distinct phases, which are designed to advance the \nsystem from one natural development step to the next. Each phase is dominated by a \nmain activity and  fi nished with a review of the work done. \n\n ECSS    de fi nes the following phases of a space project:\n\n   Phase 0   : Mission and needs identi fi cation, which establishes mission aims and \u2022 \nde fi nes functions to be performed  \n  Phase A   : Feasibility, which establishes system functional requirements   , and concept  \u2022 \n  Phase B: Preliminary de fi nition  \u2022 \n  Phase C: Detailed de fi nition  \u2022 \n  Phase D: Manufacturing assembly and testing  \u2022 \n  Phase E: Launch and operations of the system  \u2022 \n  Phase F: Disposal    \u2022 \n\n The main object of this book is the study of the \u201carchitecture de fi nition\u201d phases \nthat occur before fully funded project approval. A more detailed analysis of the con-\ntents of these phases will be provided in Chapter   6    . \n\n The transition of one phase to the following one is controlled by reviews that cer-\ntify that the previous phase was successfully completed and that the next one is ready \nto start. The process described above is strictly sequential: requirements   , design \nmanufacturing, launch, and disposal. The lower part of the  fi gure reproduces at a \nsmall scale the same V-diagram that Figure  1.5  depicted and that describes design \nfrom the general to the detailed and assembly and veri fi cation from the detailed to the \ngeneral.  \n\n Depending on the mission and on the degree of novelty of the different compo-\nnents of the system, the implementation of the mission will include higher or lower \nlevels of overlapping between design, manufacturing assembly, and veri fi cation. The \nsystem will include many larger or smaller components already existing and with \nproven records that would be used as ready off-the-shelf items. On the other hand, the \nsatellite will also include totally new components that will require comprehensive \ndetailed design and testing. To reduce mission risk,    the design, manufacturing, and \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_6\n\n\n14 Introduction to Space Systems\n\ntest of these new and most critical components shall have started well before the \nof fi cial beginning of the detailed design phase C or veri fi cation phase D.  \n\n    1.6.   What is a space system? \n\n A system is a set of interrelated or interacting elements that together fulfill a func-\ntion larger than the direct addition of the functions of its elements. The system is \nseparated from the environment and other external systems by an imaginary surface. \nThe system interacts through that surface, which de fi nes the system and its context. \nWith that de fi nition a system could be literally anything; nevertheless the elements \nof a meaningful and properly de fi ned system work together to meet a clear set of \nobjectives. In this case a meaningful space system shall be one whose elements work \ntogether to meet a space-related objective. Recalling the terminology of the previous \nsections, these objectives shall be to satisfy the requirements    of the consumers    \nwithin the constraints established by the sponsors. Through the boundaries, the \nspace system will interact with different external elements including: the sponsor   , \nthe consumer   , the external environment,    and other relevant external systems; for \ninstance, the data produced by other satellites built by other agencies but addressing \nsimilar needs.  \n\nMission\n\nRequirements\n\nPhase 0 Phase A Phase B Phase C Phase D Phase E Phase F\n\nDefinition\n\nVerification\n\nImplementation\n\nUtilization\n\nDisposal\n\nPreliminary requirements review \n\nS\nystem\n\n requirem\nents review\n\n \n\nP\nrelim\n\ninary design review\n \n\nCritical design review \n\nQualification review \n\nFlight readiness review \n\nMission definition review \n\nSystem \nElement \n\nInstrument/Platform \nAssembly \n\nPart \n\nTop down design\n\nBot\ntom\n\n up\n im\n\nple\nme\n\nnta\ntion\n\nO\nperational readiness review\n\n \n\n  Figure 1.5.

Terminology \n\n Some terms are going to be used in this book repeatedly and with a very speci fi c \nmeaning. Some of them have been already introduced. These important terms are the \nfollowing:\n\n    Endeavor . Generic term to indicate the effort needed to achieve something. It is \nalways used with a general meaning and it does not imply a clear beginning or end, \nor a clear line of authority.  \n\n   Program . It is a long-duration, large-size endeavor, which includes a related series \nof rather independent undertakings and is focused to pursue a goal. It is under the \ncontrol of a speci fi c authority and it is normally long duration.  \n\n   Project . A unique endeavor consisting of a set of coordinated and controlled activi-\nties, undertaken to achieve an objective conforming to speci fi c requirements    and \nconstraints.

This introduction \ndescribes brie fl y the roles and responsibilities of the different engineering disciplines dur-\ning all the phases of the mission implementation but it concentrates in the role they play \nduring the architectural de fi nition phases   . It is recalled that space system architectural \nde fi nition is a rigorous process as outlined in the previous chapter. Small teams of the \nsupplier    and customer    organizations, which have to keep a generalist perspective, direct \nthe architectural de fi nition. These small teams perform their activity interacting with spe-\ncialists in the different space engineering disciplines. To understand these interactions it \nis necessary to introduce these engineering disciplines. This chapter has two objectives:\n\n   To describe in detail two engineering disciplines: space system engineering    and \u2022 \nspace system architecting   . They are described in detail because they both require \nthe generalist perspective adopted by this book.  \n  To brie fl y introduce all the other engineering disciplines relevant to the process of \u2022 \nestablishing the architecture of a space system. This introduction is done empha-\nsizing the roles of the different disciplines during the space system architectural \nde fi nition phases   .    \n\n Engineering disciplines are divided into four categories:\n\n   Satellite engineering    disciplines  \u2022 \n  Payload or instruments    engineering    disciplines  \u2022 \n  Engineering support    disciplines, which include common transversal activities such \u2022 \nas: cost    analysis, veri fi cation engineering,    or quality assurance  \n  Ground segment engineering       \u2022 \n\n To study in detail the classical engineering  fi elds the reader must refer to the \n existing books that address these topics.

Nevertheless, this chapter also recalls \nthe existence of some disciplines, not considered by ECSS when discussing space \nengineering: one is system architecture engineering and the second one is the science \nand engineering involved in the generation of the  fi nal mission data products. \n\n    2.1.  Space system engineering \n\n According to NASA  System Engineering Handbook  3 , the objective of system engi-\nneering is to see that the system is designed, built, tested, and operated so that it \naccomplishes its purpose in the most cost   -effective way possible. This shall be done \nconsidering performance, cost, schedule   , and risk    (Figure  2.1 )   .  \n\n The system engineering process includes the following different functions:\n\n   Integration and control  \u2022 \n  Interfaces management  \u2022 \n  Requirements engineering     \u2022 \n  System analysis  \u2022 \n  Design and con fi guration    de fi nition  \u2022 \n  Veri fi cation       \u2022 \n\n Of these six system engineering activities, interfaces management and integration \nand control occur during all the phases of implementation of a space mission.

Integration and control \n\n System engineering integration and control ensures the integration of the various \ndisciplines and participants throughout all the project phases in order to optimize the \ntotal de fi nition and realization of the system. It provides corresponding and essential \ninputs to project management   . \n\n The integration and control functions are strongly related to project management    \nand include: the support to the project manager    required to allow the overall manage-\nment and planning, including the production and maintenance of databases, the con-\ntrol of information transfers, the management of interfaces, the creation and \nmaintenance of technical budgets,    and the technical support necessary to allow the \nproject manager to perform correctly all the activities related with risk    assessment    \nand risk reduction. \n\n Integration and control system engineering comprises the following activities:\n\n   Planning and managing of the system architecture.  \u2022 \n  Managing engineering databases.  \u2022 \n  Planning document data exchange.  \u2022 \n  Internal and external interface management.  \u2022 \n  Environment engineering.  \u2022 \n  Human factors.  \u2022 \n  System budgets    and margin philosophy.     \u2022 \n  Technology risk    assessment    and risk alleviation.  \u2022 \n  Ensure cost   -effective procurement.  \u2022 \n  Provide technical inputs to change management and assessment of the system \u2022 \nengineering capability of the providers at all levels.    \n\n During the early phases before the approval of the project, the volume of infor-\nmation produced is moderate, the number of participants is small, and it is possible \nto keep the work logically structured without heavy formal procedures   . Because of \nthe modest number of documents, the space system architect    can dispense with the \nprovision of a formal management plan and system engineering plan. Nevertheless, \nformal risk    management and risk reduction actions are necessary fundamentally to \nidentify technology risks that shall be reduced before the approval of the project. \nIt is also necessary to establish all the plans necessary to provide a correct estima-\ntion of cost    and risk, including the overall development approach    for the  fi nal \nimplementation of the project, addressing model philosophy    and technology readi-\nness level    for all elements of the system down to whatever level the technology \nrisk arises.  \n\n    2.1.2.   Interfaces management    \n\n The system engineer    also acts as an interface with project management    team and the \nengineering support disciplines such as con fi guration    control   , product assurance,    \n\n\n\n20 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nor production engineering   . The system engineer reports to the project manager    and \nprovides all the technical information necessary for accurate estimation of schedule   , \ncost,    and risk    as necessary for correct decision making. The system engineer inter-\nfaces with product assurance in the overall process of system veri fi cation and assess-\nment of the design solution. The system engineer also interfaces with production and \nlogistics including all the aspects related to manufacturing, assembling, and testing: \ntest design, execution and reporting, and test assessment. Of special interest is the \ninterface between the satellite system engineer and the in-orbit operations    of the satel-\nlites. This will require the establishment of satellite operational procedures prior to \nthe launch, and the activities related to satellite in-orbit commissioning,  fi nal in-orbit \nveri fi cation, and routine in-orbit operation    (Figure  2.2 ).   \n\n    2.1.3.   Requirements engineering \n\n Requirements engineering    is connected with the duty of the system engineer    to \nensure that the system accomplishes its purpose. This will require the establishment, \ndiscussion, negotiation, and maintenance of documents listing the requirements    on \nthe system, eventually at each level of system integration, together with a \nspeci fi cations    tree    establishing the hierarchical relations between all the speci fi cations. \nThe system engineer will play a central role, being responsible with respect to the \nmission\u2019s consumers    for providing a system able to ful fi ll their needs. The consumers    \nwill establish their needs that the system engineer will discuss and negotiate. After \nthis, the system engineer will translate these highest-level consumer needs into a set \nof formal documentation that will apply to the design to be provided by the supplier   . \nThe supplier derives more and more detailed requirements applicable to the lower-\nlevel components of the satellite that will be imposed upon the different  organizations \n\nSystem Engineering:\nIntegration and Control\n\nAnalysis\nRequirements\n\nDesign and Configuration\nVerification \n\nManagement\n\nOperations\n\nProduction\nProduct Assurance\n\nAvailability\nVerification\n\nProcurement\nCriticality\nAnalysis\nParts \n\nMaterials\nProcessed \n\nDevelopment\nManufacturing\n\nAssembly\nIntegration\n\nTesting \n\nCost\nPlanning\n\nConfiguration control\nProcurement \n\nOperations engineering\nOperations verification\n\n  Figure 2.2.

The supplier will accept or reject the delivered equipment and services on \nthe basis of the corresponding requirements and in turn will deliver the system to the \ncustomer   . The system engineer on behalf of the supplier and in turn the customer will \naccept or reject system on the basis of the applicable formal requirements as de fi ned \nin the customer\u2019s System Requirements Document   . Chapter   3     will study in detail the \ndifferent classes of speci fi cations, who owns them, and to whom they apply. It is \nevident that the cost    and risk    associated to any space system are functions of their \nperformances as formalized in their requirements. The preparatory stages of any \nspace project shall ensure that the requirements on the system are  fi rm enough so that \nwhen the formal project is started, the changes to the original set of requirements are \nminimized. Requirements engineering will be further examined in Chapter   3    .  \n\n    2.1.4.   System analysis \n\n System analyses    can be de fi ned as: making the appropriate enquiries to assist decision \nmakers in choosing a preferred future course of action by:\n\n   Systematically examining and re-examining the relevant objectives and assessing \u2022 \nalternative policies and strategies for achieving them  \n  Comparing, quantitatively where possible, the cost   -   effectiveness and risk    of the \u2022 \nalternatives    \n\n Analysis of the system performances during the early stages of a project enables \nattainment of the system requirements    and the optimal allocation of the overall per-\nformance to the different contributing elements; for example, a pointing    stability    \n fi gure will be a function of the performance of the structure, the thermal control,    and \nthe attitude control    subsystems, and the analysis of the overall performance will allow \nan investigation of alternative allocation scenarios with different apportioning to the \ndifferent error sources until the right balance between them has been struck. Another \naspect of the system analysis is functional analysis   . This can be de fi ned as \u201cwho has \nto do what?\u201d Functional analysis is also a tool used to de fi ne the baseline architecture \nand the design at different levels. According to the already mentioned reference \n System Engineering , ECSS   -E-10, before project approval the following system engi-\nneering analysis shall be performed:\n\n   Analysis of mission requirements    and derivation of high-level mission and satel-\u2022 \nlite requirements  \n  Mission analysis and orbital calculations  \u2022 \n  Operational constraints  \u2022 \n  Functional analysis of space and ground segments  \u2022 \n  Establishment and evaluation of possible mission concepts and derivation of their \u2022 \ncritical aspects  \n  Technology assessment versus design choices and establishing a preliminary \u2022 \napproach for the technologies to be developed by the mission  \n  System margins approach    and trade-off   s between risk    and performance  \u2022 \n  Cost, risk,    and schedule    estimation     \u2022 \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\n\n\n22 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    2.1.5.   Design and con fi guration de fi nition \n\n Design and con fi guration    de fi nition is the process of de fi ning the physical and logical \nhierarchies of the hardware and software    from the highest to the lowest level of com-\nplexity of the system. Con fi guration is de fi ned here, as the physical concept of the \nsatellite, and con fi guration de fi nition is the effort necessary to control the actual \nphysical con fi guration of the satellite. Design and con fi guration control includes:\n\n   The maintenance of the product tree, which de fi nes all the products to be delivered \u2022 \nand their relationships to each other  \n  Maintenance of budgets   , such as: mass, pointing   , power, computer loads, etc.  \u2022 \n  Assessment of manufacturing, assembly, veri fi cation, and operations impact on \u2022 \nthe system\u2019s design  \n  The control of the \u201cDesign Justi fi cation Files,\u201d which provide the rationale sup-\u2022 \nporting the design choices  \n  The analysis and test data, which shows that the design meets all requirements       \u2022 \n\n During the earliest stage of a space mission implementation, which is the focus of \nthis book, the volume of documentation will be moderate and normally it will not be \nnecessary to establish a complex process of control of documentation con fi guration   . \nNevertheless, this is not true for the maintenance of budgets   . Budgets maintenance    is \nfundamental from the earliest phases because:\n\n   Errors made in budget estimates at an early phase may propagate and remain \u2022 \nundetected for some time, adversely affecting design decisions at several levels.  \n  Each budget allows the breakdown of the corresponding higher-level requirement \u2022 \ninto its contributing parts making possible the derivation of the lower-level \nrequirements    for each contributor.    \n\n There is an enhanced probability of making errors in critical system budgets    early \nin the life of a project, as the maturity of the available information is relatively low. \nThis is usually catered for by the adoption of a suitable safety margin philosophy   . \nHowever, this must not allow complacency to arise, as such errors may result in the \nadoption of a nonoptimum system architecture, which could prove highly detrimental \nfor all concerned, and no margin philosophy will recover the situation once commit-\nment to hardware has been made. Hence, there must be particularly emphasis on \nachieving a system architecture that ensures good design budget margins as early as \npossible.  \n\n    2.1.6.   Veri fi cation    \n\n Veri fi cation    demonstrates, through a dedicated process, that the system meets the \napplicable requirements    and is capable of ful fi lling its role during the mission\u2019s life-\ntime. Veri fi cation addresses all constituents of the system and is incrementally per-\nformed. Veri fi cation is done bottom-up    from the small and isolated to the large and \nintegrated (Figure   1.4    ). The  fi nal stage of the veri fi cation is when the integrated sys-\ntem delivered by the supplier    has been fully veri fi ed. The system engineer    is the  fi nal \nresponsible person for certifying that the satellite and the end-to-end system require-\nments are ful fi lled. The specialists in veri fi cation and test assist him in this task; these \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n23Space Disciplines\n\nengineering disciplines will be introduced in Section  2.6.1 . Veri fi cation is much more \na task that arises at the end of the project than at the beginning. Therefore, the archi-\ntectural de fi nition phases    will not include many veri fi cation activities. Nevertheless, \nthere are two aspects of veri fi cation that are important from the earliest phases of any \nspace mission design:\n\n   The veri fi cation of critical tech   nologies that are necessary to reduce the risk    prior \u2022 \nto project go-ahead, i.e., necessary predevelopment   .  \n  The understanding of the dif fi culties \u2013 and costs \u2013 associated with the veri fi cation \u2022 \nof the mission. The establishment of any requirements    requires thinking in detail \nabout how it is going to be veri fi ed.    \n\n Predevelopment is analyzed in Section   6.5.1     and the importance of assessing \nveri fi ability as early as possible is studied in Section   3.5 .      \n\n    2.2.   Space system architecting \n\n Architecture is de fi ned by ANSI/IEEE 1471\u20132000 as \u201cThe fundamental organization \nof a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the \nenvironment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.\u201d System archi-\ntecture de fi nition is the activity needed to establish the architecture of a system and \nthe discipline that addresses the de fi nition of architecture could be called system \narchitecting. System architecting    is a novel approach whose origins lie in two \nsources:\n\n   The classical  fi gure of the architect    as the interface between the builder and the \u2022 \nclient  \n  The formalistic approach of large software    creators    \u2022 \n\n The classical approach places emphasis on understanding the real needs of the \nconsumer    and sponsor    in the context of the possible project environment. The formal-\nistic approach focuses on the development of methods for the systematic analysis of \ncomplex system so as to understand them better and design and implement them \nproperly. This section presents both approaches and analyzes to what extent they are \napplicable to space engineering. \n\n System engineering is a well-established engineering discipline, while system \narchitecting is not yet so well known. Nevertheless, system architecting is especially \nuseful for space system design in two situations:\n\n   The classical architect    approach to system architecting is quite relevant to the \u2022 \nwork prior to project approval. The classical architect perspective has been already \ndiscussed in Section   1.2     and especially in Table   1.1     and it will be revisited and \nexpanded in Section  2.2.1 .  \n  The software    formalism approach is useful for the analysis of complex and large \u2022 \nsystems of systems. This approach will be discussed in Section  2.2.2 .    \n\n Both approaches make a strong emphasis on wider perspectives, relations with the \nexternal environment   , nonnumerical approaches, and interrelations between system \nelements. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_6\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n24 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    2.2.1.   The architect    in the classical role \n\n Table   1.1     demonstrated that the perspective of the system engineer    in the early stages \nprevious to the formal approval of a space project is fundamentally a classical architect    \nperspective. According to the classical paradigm, the architect is working with, and \nfor, the client and he/she is the communication and interpretation channel between the \nclient and the builder. Nevertheless, the space architect shall also reconcile the con fl ict \ngenerated by the fact that in the overwhelming majority of space mission, there are two \nclients: the consumer    that uses and the sponsor    that pays. A large portion of the effort \nduring the architecture de fi nition phases of a possible new space mission is concerned \nwith the reconciliation of the contradiction between sponsors and consumers   . \n\n The scienti fi c tools that the architect    has for the execution of his job are just those \nthat system engineering provides to the system designer, no more, and no less. What \nthe correct architectural design perspective adds to system engineering is not new \ntools but an especial perspective. This perspective requires:\n\n   The need to consider perspectives broader than the possible space mission itself  \u2022 \n  The need to synthesize all the pertinent sources of information  \u2022 \n  To include nonmathematical considerations: heuristics   , self-discovery, and trial \u2022 \nand error approaches    \n\n To have a new space mission approved requires taking a perspective that is broader \nthan the mission itself. The mission will only be approved if the \u2013 let us assume \nproperly designed \u2013 system  fi ts into the wider external environment   . This awareness \nof the external environment would need the use of tools outside traditional system \nengineering and more in the domain of management sciences. Section   4.2     will ana-\nlyze the tools for the analysis of the external environment. This external environment \nis outside \u2013 and also above \u2013 the control of the system designer. Nevertheless, the \nawareness of this environment will be necessary to arrive at an affordable and useful \nsystem design that will be  fi nally implemented ful fi lling real consumer    needs. \n\n The architect   \u2019s perspective required for the proper de fi nition of a new space sys-\ntem values not only knowledge and equations but also wisdom and heuristics   . This \nsomehow surprising statement has been already brie fl y justi fi ed in Section   1.3    . \nChapter   5    , which analyzes the design process   , also makes continuous reference to the \nneed to develop the sensitivity to recognize proper and balanced design that is inde-\npendent of purely mathematical methods. Chapter   5     also includes numerous heuris-\ntics that are adequate for space system design. Speci fi cally, Section   5.6.2     is dedicated \nto the limitations of purely numerical methods for analyzing the overall performance \nof a space system. Indeed the whole second \u2013 and longest \u2013 part of this book, starting \nat Chapter   7     and  fi nishing at Chapter   12    , is based around the idea that presenting and \ncommenting on past designs will allow the reader to develop this nonnumerical sen-\nsitivity for what a balanced and good design is. \n\n Quoting Scott Hyers on his notes to  An Introduction to General System Thinking  \nby Weinberg 4 :\n\n  Pure scienti fi c approach says: \u201cClear logical thinking requires that we vary only one factor at a \ntime\u201c and \u201cAll other things being equal \u2026.\u201d A system is a collection of parts no one of which can \n\n   4   Quoted by Scott Hyer in a presentation to Incose.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\n\n\n25Space Disciplines\n\nbe changed without changing the core character of the system. Therefore the study of system is not \nconducive to the \u201cone factor at a time\u201d strategy   .   \n\n This would mean that proper system thinking could not be wholly \u201cscienti fi c.\u201d It \nneeds a supplementary perspective. This perspective is not easy to de fi ne and a \nscienti fi c system method of architecture de fi nition or tool kit is not easy because the \nrequired perspective is: unstructured, eclectic, heuristic, and even artistic. It is a syn-\nthesis of many skills not all of which are analytical, and yet sciences are analytical.  \n\n    2.2.2.   Architecture de fi nition formalisms \n\n The fundamental aim of formalistic system architecting    is the creation of unambigu-\nous descriptions of a complex system where the functions, relations, features, and \nbehavior of the system are clearly explained. This is performed by the development \nof a clear and rigid set of concepts that applied correctly will unambiguously describe \nthe system. This description supports reasoning about the properties of the system. It \nde fi nes the system building blocks and provides a plan from which products can be \nprocured, and systems developed. It thus enables the management and development \nof complex systems in an optimal way. It is evident from the previous paragraph that \narchitecture de fi nition formalisms provide direction on how to describe architectures; \nthe framework does not provide guidance in how to design or implement a speci fi c \narchitecture  . \n\n There are several approaches to arrive at these descriptions. An introduction can \nbe provided by the approach followed by IEEE P1471, 5  which is a set of software    \nengineering standards, but is at the same time very general and independent of any \nspeci fi c framework. According to this approach every system is described by several \narchitectural descriptions. Each architectural description    is called a view. \n\n A view is a representation of a system from the perspective of related concerns or \nissues. The view is provided with internal logic by the viewpoint of the representa-\ntion. The viewpoint is a template pattern or speci fi cation that answers the concerns of \na speci fi c type of stakeholder in the system. We can have as many different but mutu-\nally consistent description of the system as classes of stakeholders we can imagine. \nThe \u201cview\u201d answers the concerns of the stakeholders and it provides the link between \nthe classical and the modern approaches to system engineering. \n\n The formal architectural description    provides a mechanism for understanding and \nmanaging complexity   . Defense systems are extremely complicated and they comprise \nmany fairly autonomous functional and physical blocks, and the defense world has \ndeveloped extensively the use of architecture de fi nition formalisms. The American \nDepartment of Defense has produced a set of guidelines for the creation of views. \n\n According to Figure  2.3 , an architectural framework shall have three fundamental \nviews: \n\n   Operational view     \u2022 \n  System view     \u2022 \n  The technical view       \u2022 \n\n   5   IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description, IEEE P1471 1999.  \n\n\n\n26 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n The operational view is a description of the tasks and activities, operational \n   elements, and information  fl ows required to accomplish or support a military opera-\ntion. It contains descriptions \u2013 often graphical \u2013 of the operational elements, assigned \ntasks and activities, and information  fl ows required to support the system under con-\nsideration. It de fi nes the types of information exchanged, the frequency of exchange, \nwhich tasks and activities are supported by the information exchanges, and the nature \nof information exchanges in detail suf fi cient to ascertain speci fi c interoperability \nrequirements   . \n\n The system view is a set of descriptions of systems and interconnections providing \nfor or supporting system functions. The system architecture view shows how multiple \nsystems link and interoperate and may describe the internal construction and opera-\ntions of particular systems within the architecture. For the individual system, the \nsystem architecture view includes the physical connection, location, and identi fi cation \nof key nodes (including materiel item nodes), circuits, networks, platforms, etc., and \nspeci fi es system and component performance parameters. The system architecture \nview associates physical resources and their performance attributes to the operational \nview and its requirements    per standards de fi ned in the technical architecture. \n\n The technical view    is the minimal set of rules governing the arrangement, interac-\ntion, and interdependence of the parts or elements whose purpose is to ensure that a \nconformant system satis fi es a speci fi ed set of requirements   . The technical architecture \nview provides the technical systems-implementation guidelines upon which engi-\nneering speci fi cations    are based, common building blocks are established, and prod-\nuct lines are developed. The technical architecture view includes a collection of the \ntechnical standards, conventions, rules, and criteria organized into pro fi le(s) that \ngovern system services, interfaces, and relationships for particular system architec-\nture views and that relate to particular operational views.   \n\nOperational View:\nIdentifies relationships and\n\ninformation needs   \n\nSystems\nView:\n\nRelates\ncapabilities and\n\ncharacteristics to\nrequirements\n\nTechnical\nView:\n\nPrescribes\nstandards and\nconventions\n\nSpecify capabilities to satisfy information\n\nexchange and specify operational requirements \n\nTechnical criteria governing interoperability and\nimplementation and procurement of the selected capabilities \n\nPr\noc\n\nes\nsin\n\ng \nan\n\nd \nint\n\ner\n-n\n\nod\nal \n\nlev\nels\n\n o\nf\n\ninf\nor\n\nm\nat\n\nion\n e\n\nxc\nha\n\nng\ne \n\nre\nqu\n\nire\nm\n\nen\nts\n\nSy\nste\n\nm\ns a\n\nss\noc\n\niat\nion\n\ns t\no \n\nno\nde\n\ns,\n\nac\ntiv\n\nitie\ns, \n\nne\ned\n\nlin\nes\n\n a\nnd\n\n re\nqu\n\nire\nm\n\nen\nts\n\nBasic technology supportability\n\nand new capabilities\n\nProcessing and levels of inform\nation\n\nexchange requirem\nents\n\n  Figure 2.3.     Fundamental Views as per the USA Department of Defense (C4ISR Architecture \nFramework, Architectures Working Group, Department of Defense, 1997).       \n\n \n\n\n\n27Space Disciplines\n\n    2.3.   Project management \n\n For the supplier    and customer   , the overall authority on the space project is in the \nhands of a single person who ensures the success of the project with respect to it being \non schedule   , within the cost    ceiling, and ful fi lling the requirements   . This is the func-\ntion of the project manager   . The responsibilities of project management    include:\n\n   Phasing of the project  \u2022 \n  Cost and schedule    management  \u2022 \n  Con fi guration management  \u2022 \n  Information and documentation management  \u2022 \n  Project organization and work breakdown  \u2022 \n  Logistics and support  \u2022 \n  Human resources including: staf fi ng, training, and appraisal of individual \u2022 \nperformances    \n\n A large space project is a large endeavor of the extreme complexity including \nscienti fi c, technical, economic, and managerial aspects. The implementation of a \nspace project requires the cooperation of many organizations cooperating to provide \na product, which satis fi es the consumer    requirements    while ful fi lling the sponsor    \nconstraints on cost    and schedule   . To reach this goal, technical activities and human \nand  fi nancial resources shall be organized and coordinated in a structured manner in \norder to obtain the end product. This structure, together with related processes, con-\nstitutes a project. It implies a target (the system), a time frame, and actions to be \nperformed under resources constraints. Project management consists of the de fi nition, \nimplementation, and execution of such actions including the veri fi cation of achieved \nresults against project projections and expectations. \n\n Project management requires careful deliberation of what shall be accomplished, \nlaying out all the steps needed to build that future, and obtaining the resources \nrequired to carry out those steps. But most important, it requires dealing with reality, \nproblems, delays, changes, obstacles, and, sometimes, opportunities that arise as a \nproject takes place. That means, it implies dealing with risk    in the real world. In the \narchitectural de fi nition phases,    the leaders of the customer    and supplier    small teams \nact often as project managers as well as architects.  \n\n    2.4.   Satellite engineering disciplines \n\n To design a space system involves far more than designing just the satellite, but it is \nthe presence of the satellite that makes a system a space system, and it is evident that \nthe satellite design will take the largest part of the effort of designing the space sys-\ntem. To design and build a satellite it is necessary to integrate a set of well-de fi ned \nand complementary engineering disciplines. The division in satellite engineering \ndisciplines    used by ECSS    includes:\n\n   Mechanical, which includes structures   , thermal control,    mechanisms,    and propulsion     \u2022 \n  Electric power   , electronics,    and data handling     \u2022 \n  Software     \u2022 \n\n\n\n28 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  Communications     \u2022 \n  Satellite attitude control    and orbit control       \u2022 \n\n All these engineering disciplines are going to be introduced in the following \nsections. \n\n    2.4.1.   Structure    \n\n Structure    is every part of the satellite carrying loads and supporting or protecting \nother satellite parts. In order to carry and protect, the structure must provide strength    \nand rigidity for withstanding environmental loads without endangering the mission\u2019s \nobjectives. The structure must also be stable enough to avoid deformations that could \ndegrade mission performances, for example, by mispointing    the instruments   . The \nstructure also provides other functions like protection from the Sun    and electrical \nconductivity or isolation. The structure has to provide its carrying functions during \nall phases of the mission: on-ground and in-orbit. \n\n During the architecture de fi nition phases there are two fundamental issues:\n\n   To provide a shape \u2013 that means a con fi guration    \u2013 to the stowed and deployed \u2022 \nphysical envelope of the satellite  \n  To provide an inner skeleton \u2013 a primary structure    proper \u2013 to the satellite    \u2022 \n\n This inner skeleton acts as the main load path for the whole satellite. The outer \nshape and the inner skeleton shall ful fi ll their structural function during the widely \nchanging environmental situations during the entire satellite lifetime comprising the \nfollowing steps:\n\n   On ground, the structure acts as bench to mount the rest of the satellite around it. \u2022 \nThe structure\u2019s adequacy for on-ground assembly, disassembly, and transportation \nis also an important design factor that must be taken into account.  \n  During launch, the structure withstands the heavy loads generated by the  fi ring of \u2022 \nthe rocket engines   .  \n  In orbit the structure holds in the deployed con fi guration    the rest of the satellite in \u2022 \nthe right location and in the right orientation. The structure shall also withstand the \nloads generated by satellite maneuvers.    \n\n The shape of the stowed con fi guration    inside the launcher    and the shape of the \ndeployed satellite in orbit can be very different. This requires the use of deployment \nmechanisms    to recon fi gure the satellite once in orbit and separated from the \nlauncher. \n\n Structural engineering    disciplines are based on stress analysis    and strength    of \nmaterial sciences. Finite Element Analysis is the standard technique to determine \nstress and strength in the structure of a satellite. Structural engineering is a mature \ndiscipline with well-established procedures, well-proven structural assembly tech-\nniques, and highly reliable analytical methods. On the other hand, the correct shaping \nof a satellite is as much an art as it is a science. The shaping of the satellite is a true \nmultidisciplinary activity that can only be properly performed by considering the \ncon fl icting demands of all the components of the satellite during all the satellite life \nstages. That means satellite con fi guration    is based primarily on the interrelations \n\n\n\n29Space Disciplines\n\nbetween satellite components, which is the main focus of attention of this book, and \nin line with this attention, it is extensively discussed in Chapter   10    . Speci fi cally, \nstructural engineering tools are studied in Section   10.1.1    .  \n\n    2.4.2.   Thermal control \n\n The thermal control    components of a satellite keep the hardware within speci fi ed \ntemperature levels, preventing them from becoming too cold or too hot. The thermal \ncomponents need to ful fi ll this function throughout the mission\u2019s entire lifespan and \nduring all foreseeable situations. To do so, the thermal components must be able to \nprovide heat when the hardware becomes too cold and have the ability to dissipate \nheat when the hardware becomes too hot. \n\n Heat transfer inside the satellite takes place via radiation or conduction but the \ninterchange of heat between the satellite and the external environment    always occurs \nthrough radiation. The thermal components can also be used to provide uniform ther-\nmal conditions inside the satellite reducing thermoelastic distortions    and improving \ndimensional stability   . Thermal control engineering is the technical domain that deals \nwith the techniques necessary to ensure that all the components of the satellite are \nkept within adequate temperature ranges. Thermal control engineering can be divided \ninto specialized subdomains depending of the temperature range. Thermal engineer-\ning can be divided in three main categories:\n\n   Cryogenic, below 120 K  \u2022 \n  High temperatures above 420 K  \u2022 \n  Conventional between 120 and 420 K    \u2022 \n\n During the early stages of the project, the thermal engineering is mainly concerned \nwith the correct location and sizing of the radiators to dissipate the heat produced by \nthe satellite with the orbital geometry provided by the satellite con fi guration   , the \norbit, and the attitude. That means the location of the radiators in fl uences and is \nin fl uenced by the satellite con fi guration. The location of the radiators is a special \nthermal requirement, like the need to keep an instrument within very high or low or \nvery restricted temperature ranges. The thermal control    is also a well-established \nengineering  fi eld and the thermal control within conventional ranges around the nor-\nmal ambient temperature around 300 K can be considered mature. On the other hand, \nthe development of dedicated thermal components for devices that require operating \nat very high or very low temperatures    will require special developments that could \nrequire manufacturing and testing of the dedicated components prior to the project \napproval. \n\n Thermal engineers use analytical techniques like  fi nite difference analysis to deter-\nmine the interchange of heat between the different parts of the satellite and between \nthem and the space around the satellite. These analyses allow for the determination \nof the temperature of all the satellite elements during all the mission phases    as a func-\ntion of time. The design of thermal control   , for satellites that do not need to dissipate \nlarge amounts of localized heat and that work at conventional temperatures, is \nmature, and there are proven methods of design and reliable methods of analysis. \nHowever, the design for thermal controls working at very low temperatures    or dissi-\npating large amounts of heat is complex and requires the consideration of the impact \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n30 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nof thermal design    decisions on other satellite subsystems; for example, a satellite can \nsimplify its thermal control at the expenses of complicating its con fi guration   . These \nimpacts will be studied in Chapter   10    . Speci fi cally, thermal design tools and issues \nare revisited and expanded in Section   10.1.2    .  \n\n    2.4.3.   Mechanisms \n\n A mechanism is de fi ned here as any device used to change the geometric con fi guration    \nof a satellite or part of a satellite in order to ensure the satellite\u2019s correct \nfunctioning. \n\n Mechanism recon fi guration can be internal to a speci fi c satellite component or can \nintroduce major and visible changes to the satellite\u2019s overall con fi guration   . Internal \nmechanisms    perform all the movement functions required by satellite components, \nfor example, those allowing for the rotation of momentum wheels    or the pointing    of \nan instrument along a line of sight   . External mechanisms are required for producing \nany temporary or permanent changes in the satellite\u2019s overall con fi guration. These \nchanges are driven by the contrast between the constrained and stressed environment \nof the stowed satellite during launch and the unconstrained and lightly loaded envi-\nronment of the satellite once in orbit. To perform these recon fi guration functions \nmechanisms must:\n\n   Restrain and lock the component to be recon fi gured until the moment the \u2022 \nrecon fi guration is required.  \n  Release the components to allow the recon fi guration to start.  \u2022 \n  Generate forces and torques    producing the movement required by the \u2022 \nrecon fi guration.  \n  Minimize friction during the movement.  \u2022 \n  Measure and control the movement.  \u2022 \n  Lock the recon fi gured parts once the required movement is performed.    \u2022 \n\n The change from the launch-stowed to the in-orbit-deployed con fi guration    is of \nspecial importance. \n\n Once the recon fi guration is  fi nished, mechanisms    become structural in functional \nterms because they carry loads and provide support, and because they have to provide \nstrength    and stiffness   . Like structures   , mechanisms shall also provide accurate posi-\ntioning and dimensional stability   . Mechanisms engineering uses all the structural \nengineering tools together with specialized knowledge in supplementary areas \nincluding:\n\n   Electromechanical actuators to provide the energy and the movement required to \u2022 \nchange shape or to enable the movements  \n  Tribology   , that means lubrication science and engineering, to ensure smooth \u2022 \nmovements in all conditions  \n  Control theory and control electronics    in the very likely case that movements \u2022 \nwould be enabled and controlled by electrical actuators and sensors    \n\n Mechanisms need to perform their intended function in orbit safely and reliably. \nThe changing thermal situation and the vacuum of the space environment    make space \nespecially unfriendly with respect to ensuring smooth movements between the \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n31Space Disciplines\n\n different parts of the mechanism. High and low temperature will produce thermal \n expansion    or contraction, loosening, or tightening mechanisms   . The complex thermal \nsituation and the vacuum render useless many lubricants adequate for use on Earth   ; \nthe engineering discipline of developing substances that lubricate ef fi ciently in vac-\nuum is the well-established domain of space tribology   . Mechanisms engineering also \ndrives and can be driven by the design of the con fi guration    of the satellite. Satellites \nwith a large difference between stowed and deployed con fi gurations will require \nmany and complex mechanisms. The accurate control of pointing    and alignments and \nthe in-orbit operations    of specialized mechanisms as required by the pointing of satel-\nlite instruments    is an area that is normally strongly mission dependent, requiring \nconsiderable effort in the early stages of a project. To reduce mission risk    and before \nthe approval for the project, it is often necessary to design and test the most innova-\ntive and critical mechanisms required by the mission. Mechanisms will be discussed \nin more detail in Section   10.1.3.      \n\n    2.4.4.   Attitude control \n\n To survive and properly perform their functions, orbiting satellites must point in \nspeci fi c directions; which is to say that satellites in orbit need to determine and con-\ntrol their attitude. The attitude control    system is the part of the satellite, which is \ndesigned to provide control to the satellite. \n\n Satellite control engineering is the technical discipline that ensures that the satel-\nlite\u2019s status is the desired one in the context of its variable external environment   . In \nparticular, satellite attitude    control    engineering deals with the control of the attitude. \nThat means, the control of the orientation of the satellite body with respect to a refer-\nence frame. The attitude control of the satellite includes sensors and actuators acting \nupon the satellite. The control will also include some kind of feedback loop. \n\n Attitude determination    devices sense a satellite\u2019s attitude, which aids controlling \nthe satellite\u2019s current attitude. The logic of the control loop can be digital or analog. \nIn the case of a digital control loop, the control logic can be implemented by the satel-\nlite\u2019s central processor or be given its own dedicated processor. Actuators are used to \nprovide the torques    necessary for producing the required attitude changes. Satellites \nshould be capable of assuming different attitudes with different sets of requirements    \nfor different situations. Each of these situations will de fi ne a mode for the satellite\u2019s \nattitude control    and may require different sensors, actuators, and control logic. \nAttitude modes will be examined in Section   9.5    . \n\n During the architecture de fi nition phases prior to project approval, it will be \nnecessary to establish the control concept, the sensor and actuator tools, and the \ncontrol loops. The resulting designs must be supported by analysis to demonstrate \nthat they are in line with requirements   . The selection of the satellite attitude    derives \ndirectly from the needs of the events under observation, and it impacts heavily on \nthe satellite con fi guration    because the satellite attitude directly drives the satellite\u2019s \nshape. The satellite could have different attitudes depending on the different satellite \noperational status. In some situations, the closing of the loop will involve action \nfrom the on-ground satellite control team. This introduces a supplementary interface \nbetween attitude control    and satellite operations   . Attitude control is also discussed \nin Section   9.1.3    .  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n32 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    2.4.5.   Propulsion    \n\n Satellite orbits    frequently require small and large corrections. Large corrections are \nnecessary when the launcher    releases the satellite into an intermediate orbit. Small \ncorrections are necessary to avoid the satellite orbit drifting with respect to the nomi-\nnal one due to perturbations from, for example, atmospheric drag    or the gravitational \neffect of the Moon    or Sun   . Propulsion    is de fi ned as the set of components providing \nthe satellite with thrust    for autonomous orbit correction   . \n\n The propulsion    components of the satellite include the propellant, propellant tanks   , \npipes,  fi lters, valves, and thrusters   . The propellant or propellants provide chemical \nenergy, which is transformed into kinetic energy of the gases ejected by the thrusters. \nThe on-board propulsion components allow the satellite to apply forces thereby con-\ntrolling its orbit. On-board propulsion can be used also to apply torques    to the satel-\nlite. In this case the propulsion will behave as an attitude control    actuator. \n\n One of the  fi rst and most fundamental decisions to be taken during the architec-\ntural de fi nition phases    is the orbit selection and the de fi nition of the orbit control    \napproaches. Being such a high-level decision, it is normally taken considering the \nmission as a whole with the implications on the de fi nition of the propulsion    subsys-\ntem    being only one factor within many. In this case the selection of the orbit and the \norbit control approach will determine if it is necessary to carry complex, simple, or \nno propulsion at all. The energy necessary to change the orbit will be provided by the \nchemical or pressure energy stored on the propellants. In the case of electric propul-\nsion    the energy will be provided by converted electric energy obtained from the Sun   . \nThe propulsion concept will be selected once that the launcher   , the trajectory, and the \noverall orbit correction    and control are established. \n\n Propulsion    and other tools of orbit determination    and control are discussed in \nSection   9.1.2    . \n\n The design of rocket engines   , both for large launcher    engines and for small satel-\nlite thrusters   , is highly specialized and rather disconnected from the other space \nengineering disciplines. The propulsion    components of a satellite are almost never \ndesigned speci fi cally for the mission but selected from within a range of already \navailable components that appear suitable to ful fi ll mission needs. From this point of \nview propulsion engineer plays a relatively small role on the overall process of archi-\ntectural de fi nition. \n\n The simultaneous decision regarding the launcher, orbit, and the architecture of \norbital control    is a fundamental one, to be taken early in the project and having major \nimpact throughout the mission design; this means it is a decision in which the mission \narchitect    plays the leading role. The architect shall also be active in identifying the \nimplications for the mission of design decisions made by the propulsion    specialist, \nsuch as the reduction of instrument availability    during orbit corrections or the choice \nbetween satellite autonomy    and ground intervention    for orbit determination    and con-\ntrol, to be discussed in Chapter   11     as part of satellite operations   .  \n\n    2.4.6.   Electrical power \n\n Electrical powe   r engineering is the technical domain dealing with the provision of \nelectrical power to the satellite. The electrical power has to be: produced, stored, \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n33Space Disciplines\n\nregulated, and distributed. In almost all cases the power is produced by solar cells   , is \nstored in batteries,    and is regulated and distributed by specialized electronic    assem-\nblies. Solar cells    are located in solar arrays   . These arrays are large,  fl at, slender struc-\ntures    of suf fi cient area to accommodate the solar cells over them. Solar arrays are \noften deployed to allow the collection of the required amount of solar energy. Once \ndeployed, the solar arrays are oriented to track the variable direction of the Sun    along \nthe orbit. The power subsystem    also directly controls power provision to heaters   , pyro \ninitiators, and other key elements that must be able to operate even when major com-\nponents of the satellite are disabled. \n\n Two very different aspects characterize power engineering:\n\n   The engineering of electrical power production, control, storage, and distribution. \u2022 \nThis is an electrical engineering discipline.  \n  The engineering of providing deployable structures    where the solar cells    can be \u2022 \nlocated and where they can properly track the Sun    to provide maximal energy. \nThis is a mechanical engineering discipline.    \n\n Most missions have very similar power storage, regulation, and distribution \nrequirements    and it is possible to use well-proven designs from one project to the \nnext with small modi fi cations. This means the design of the electrical part of power \nengineering is fairly standard and it does not require heavy interactions between \nthe power engineering specialists and the rest of the architectural design team. In \nmost cases, this will also be the situation for the \u201cmechanical\u201d aspects of the power \nproduction design; quali fi ed solar arrays    concepts with its hold-downs during \nlaunch, deployment, and Sun   -tracking mechanisms    can be used from one project \nto the next with small modi fi cations. Nevertheless, the solar arrays strongly \nin fl uence the satellite\u2019s con fi guration,    and the con fi guration interrelates with \nalmost all the satellite design aspects. For example, it is sometimes possible to \naccommodate the solar arrays as panels  fi xed to the spacecraft\u2019s structure, particu-\nlarly if the power demand is modest and the orbit is suitable. This has the advan-\ntage of avoiding the need for solar panel hold-down, release, and deployment and \nif required, solar arrays    drive mechanisms, all of which add cost    and mass. \nConversely such  fi xed solar panels    operate with a higher temperature, as they lack \nthe ability to radiate the absorbed solar energy from their rear faces. This is a clear \nexample of the interactive nature of spacecraft design, where the requirements of \nelectrical power generation must be considered as a trade-off    exercise in combina-\ntion with the consequences for spacecraft con fi guration, equipment accommoda-\ntion, orbit selection, and thermal and structural design. Therefore, solar array \naccommodation will play an important role during the architectural design phases \nof space mission de fi nition. \n\n Power engineering from the electrical point of view is further discussed in Section \n  11.1.1    . Solar arrays as structures    are discussed in Section   10.1.4    .  \n\n    2.4.7.   Data handling \n\n The on-board data handling    is the spacecraft\u2019s central nervous system. It monitors, \nstores, and controls the status, health, and performance of each satellite component. \nMoreover, the data handling interprets and executes the commands sent by mission \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n34 Introduction to Space Systems\n\ncontrol    and received and decoded by the communications subsystem   . Depending on \nthe nature of these commands they will be for either immediate or delayed execution. \nThe data handling is also capable of executing commands autonomously, as needed \nfor the operation of the mission and depending on the design\u2019s level of autonomy   . \nThis system also records and provides time data for the satellite\u2019s components. \n\n Satellite on-board data handling    systems have two salient features:\n\n   The hardware has to work in the harsh space environment   . This forces the use of \u2022 \nwell-characterized components and also requires the use of robust and redundant \ndesigns thereby ensuring the survival of the satellite and the recovery of the data \nhandling    functionalities, even in the case of multiple failures.  \n  The time needed to design, implement, and  fl y a space mission is longer than the \u2022 \nlife cycle of data handling    technologies.    \n\n These two factors combine to make a satellite\u2019s data handling    technologies very \nconservative \u2013 even old fashioned \u2013 with respect to their on-ground equivalents. This \nsituation is sometimes so extreme that during the early design phases of a space sys-\ntem it is necessary to take into account the likely probability that components used by \nthe design under consideration could become obsolete and unavailable when, many \nyears later, it is necessary to implement them. Besides the conservative attitude of \nsatellite data handling engineering, the advances in information technology push \ncontinuously toward more autonomous and powerful on-board designs. \n\n The number and style of observations and the data to be produced will be different \nfor each new mission. Therefore, a dedicated architecture of the data handling    shall \nbe designed during the architectural de fi nition phases    of the mission. The design of \nthe architecture requires de fi ning the number and role of the on-board computers    and \ndedicated data processing units that will process the information, the number, and \nspeed of the data buses    that will transfer information and the number, speed, and stor-\nage capability of the data storage devices   . \n\n In all satellites, there is always a central computer that controls the satellite as a \nwhole, but supplementary computers could control speci fi c areas; for example, the \nhandling, processing, and storage of the data generated by the instruments    or the control \nof the satellite attitude   . A fully centralized data handling    is normally the responsibility \nof a single supplier but the responsibility in decentralized data handling is normally \ndistributed between the suppliers of the different assemblies. In many missions the \narchitecture of the on-board data handling differentiates between components special-\nized in the handling of the stream of data produced by the instruments and the monitor-\ning and control of the status and health of the whole satellite. Satellite data handling is \nrevisited and expanded in Section   11.1.2    , and the data handling of the instruments data \noutput is further analyzed in Section   12.1.1    .  \n\n    2.4.8.   Software    \n\n Software    is de fi ned as the set of computer programs, procedures, documentation, and \ntheir associated data. Software is clearly an independent engineering discipline with \nits own methods and skills. On the other hand, software    resides physically in the \ncomputer and the computers are a part of data handling    engineering, which has been \nintroduced in the previous section. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\n\n\n35Space Disciplines\n\n The on-board software       will be new for each new mission but the actual coding of \nthe software    is considered detail engineering that is implemented after the architecture \nde fi nition phases of the space mission have  fi nished. During the architecture de fi nition \nphases the involvement of software specialists is minimal. At most software design is \nconsidered only at the level of functional analysis    and functional blocks to be imple-\nmented. Missions advancing the state of a science will require the early development \nof algorithms to process the data produced by the instruments   , but this is more related \nwith the science behind the space mission than with software engineering as such. \n\n The software    related to any space mission can be divided into two:\n\n   On-ground  \u2022 \n  In-orbit    \u2022 \n\n Taking into account the danger involved during satellite operations   , in-orbit soft-\nware    is especially important. Critical software is de fi ned as the software supporting a \nsafety or dependability critical function that if incorrect or inadvertently executed can \nresult in catastrophic or critical consequences; that means, loss of life or loss of the \nspace mission. Critical software has specialized methods of product assurance    and \nveri fi cation. During the architectural de fi nition phases    of the space mission it is not \nnecessary to design the software, not even the critical software, but in order to prop-\nerly de fi ne the cost    of the mission, it is necessary to de fi ne the software and critical \nsoftware development approaches.  \n\n    2.4.9.   Communications    \n\n Communications    is the engineering discipline that allows the interchange of informa-\ntion between the satellite and ground segment   . \n\n The telemetry    and telecommand    data communications components allow the inter-\nchange of information between the satellite and ground segment    providing the ground \noperations personnel with the necessary information to determine the status, health, \nand performance of each satellite component, and receive the commands sent from \nground to control the satellite\u2019s functions, either in nominal mode    or when dealing \nwith contingencies, by receiving high-priority commands to directly address the most \nfundamental components of the satellite. In cases where the satellite has a single com-\nmunication downlink   , as occurs in many space-science satellites, the link will be used \nto send to Earth    all the data produced by the satellite and its instruments   . The infor-\nmation sent to the satellite generally consists of modi fi cations to the on-board soft-\nware   , data to be stored on the satellite computers, or commands to change the state \nof the on-board components. In almost all Earth observation    missions there is a sec-\nond independent link that codes, encrypts, modulates, ampli fi es, and downlinks to \nEarth the data produced by the instruments. This second link is justi fi ed because the \ndata throughput    of the instruments is much larger than the data throughput of the rest \nof the satellite. \n\n Almost all communication links use modulated microwave signals to transfer the \ndata from the satellite to and from the ground, but some successful satellite-to- \nsatellite optical communications    links have been already  fl own. The stream of bits \nbetween the satellite and ground is coded using different digital schemes. To avoid \ninterference between satellites and from satellites to ground communications, the \n\n\n\n36 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nfrequencies and frequency bandwidths for different types of satellites is strictly \n regulated. The communication link performances will depend strongly on the gain    of \nthe satellite and ground antennae. Large on-ground high-gain antenna will improve \nthe link but they are expensive as are large and pointable satellite antennae and addi-\ntionally they are less reliable than low-gain omnidirectional ones. \n\n The downlink    communication needs of each new mission will depend not only on \nthe number and style of observations and on the amount of data to be produced, but \nalso on the number and performances of the ground stations    used. The selection of \nthe ground stations is dependent upon the orbit of the satellite. The possible use of \ndata relay satellites    may be necessary when the data  fl ow is very high, or when it is \nessential to have continuity of data  fl ow. Therefore, the design of the communications \narchitecture requires a panoramic view of the overall mission. Normally the data  fl ow \nbetween the satellite and ground is channeled through a limited number of ground \nstations, and communications are only possible during the periods when the ground \nstations have visibility of the satellite. For some orbits these periods can be long or \neven permanent as in the case of geostationary orbits    (Section   9.4.4    ). \n\n Telemetry and telecommand    communications is further discussed in Section   11.1.3    . \nThe downlink    of the data produced by the instruments    is discussed in Section   12.1.2.       \n\n    2.5.   Instruments engineering \n\n The justi fi cation of the existence of any space mission is their payload or instruments   . \nThe satellite is built to  fl y their instruments, and all the other components of the satel-\nlite are designed to be at their service. Furthermore, the structural concept, thermal \napproaches, power subsystems, data handling    architectures, and even whole satellite \nplatforms could be reused from one space mission to the next, but instruments typi-\ncally are bespoke for each new mission. All these reasons make instruments engineer-\ning    the most important part of the effort during the architecture de fi nition phases of \nany new space mission, and the work done during these phases will always be fairly \ndetailed in the de fi nition of the instruments to be  fl own by the satellite. This will \nrequire a design detailed enough:\n\n   To ensure that the performances of the instrument will be in line with the require-\u2022 \nments   . The performance of the instruments    is directly related to the ful fi llment of \nthe desires of the consumer    needs.  \n  To ensure that the risks related to the instruments    have been properly identi fi ed, \u2022 \nthat the development approaches to minimize these risks have been established, \nand that the associated costs and schedules have been determined.    \n\n Instruments can be very varied; there are many instrument classes depending on \nthe physical features they measure. These physical features could be an in-situ    mea-\nsurement of the space being traveled by the satellite. More often instruments    will \nmeasure the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a remote event. \n\n The design of space instruments    requires the contribution of all the engineering \ndisciplines listed in Section  2.4 . A telescope    will have its structure, thermal control   , \npointing    mechanisms   , data handling    electronics,    and power handling electronics. \nAdditionally, a telescope will be an optical instrument that requires the support of \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\n\n\n37Space Disciplines\n\noptical engineers who provide its optical design and detectors engineers who provide \nknow-how on the devices that will detect the photons collected by the telescopes. The \nsame type of specialized knowledge will be necessary to design any other type of \nreceiving instruments from magnetometer to radar. \n\n Instruments can be divided into the following types:\n\n   Passive optical instruments   . These rely on electromagnetic radiation    emitted or \u2022 \nre fl ected by the events being observed.  \n  Active optical instruments   . These emit and receive laser pulses.  \u2022 \n  Passive microwave instruments   . These detect microwave radiation emitted by the \u2022 \nevents being observed.  \n  Active microwave instruments   . They emit and detect microwave signals backscat-\u2022 \ntered by the events under observation.  \n  In-situ instruments. They    do not perform remote sensing    but measure the local \u2022 \nenvironment around the satellite.    \n\n Depending on the nature of the instruments    the nature of the dedicated knowledge \nto design them will be different. Some instruments are highly specialized, small, with \nclear interfaces, and they produce data of interest only for a narrow community. In \nthis case they can be directly de fi ned and implemented by the small consumer    com-\nmunity that is going to use the data. In this case the delivery of the instruments could \nbe contractually separated from the delivery of the rest of the satellite and the rela-\ntionship between the instruments and the rest of the satellite will be controlled by \nspeci fi c interface rules. This approach has been very common in the past but nowa-\ndays many instruments are large, with complex interfaces with the rest of the satellite, \nand their data is of interest to a dispersed community that cannot be made collectively \nresponsible for building the instruments. Consequently instruments of this second \ntype are a distinct part \u2013 indeed the most important part \u2013 of the satellite, and the \norganizational arrangements to produce them are identical to the arrangements for \nany other part of the satellite. Chapter   8     will further study satellite instruments.  \n\n    2.6.   Engineering support disciplines \n\n This text considers a third group \u2013 on top of satellite subsystem    engineering and \ninstruments    engineering    \u2013 that this text calls \u201csupport disciplines.\u201d These disciplines \napply horizontally to all the components making a space system. These disciplines \nrepresent a considerable part of the  fi nal cost    \u2013 and of the associated problems \u2013 on \nany space mission. \n\n    2.6.1.   Manufacturing assembly, integration, veri fi cation,    and testing \nengineering \n\n To implement the end-to-end space system, it is necessary to perform a cascade of \nactivities: manufacture, assembly, integrate, verify, and test all its components. This \nset of activities will be performed with parts, assemblies, subsystems, and elements \nof increasing level of complexity until the process  fi nishes with the integration of the \nwhole system. This set is the  fi rst part of the ascending \u201cimplementation\u201d branch of \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n38 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nthe scheme of Figure   1.4    , which depicts system design and implementation as a \nV-process   . All these activities involve speci fi c engineering skills \u2013 manufacturing, \nassembling, and testing    \u2013 and all of them shall take into account the process of system \narchitectural de fi nition. The reasons are the following:\n\n   During the architectural de fi nition phases    it is necessary to provide credible esti-\u2022 \nmations of system implementation cost    and risk   , and all the activities indicated \nabove are costly and risky.  \n  As indicated in the V-process    scheme, the earliest and the latest phases of a space mis-\u2022 \nsion are logically related because they deal with the design and veri fi cation of system-\nlevel \u2013 as opposed to detailed-level \u2013 features. This will require that the approach to \nsystem-level veri fi cation is de fi ned during the earliest system design stages.  \n  The de fi nition of the architecture of the mission includes the establishment of the \u2022 \nperformance that the system is going to ful fi ll and the demonstration that the  system \nis feasible and able to ful fi ll their performances. This requires that the approach to \nverify the performances is included in the architectural de fi nition process.  \n  In many cases, possible new missions require the development of new techniques. \u2022 \nTo reduce the level of project risk    the new techniques shall be developed before \nthe project starts. That means, the techniques shall be developed during the archi-\ntectural de fi nition phases   .    \n\n The set of the skills to perform these activities correctly are called production and \nveri fi cation engineering   . \n\n Production engineering covers all the preparatory work necessary to ensure that \nthe product will be manufactured, assembled, and integrated at the lowest possible \ncost   , in the de fi ned timescale, and in accordance with the requirements    speci fi ed. \nOnce the project is approved, production engineering    will trade-off    possible produc-\ntion technologies, identify and optimize critical fabrication and assembly proce-\ndures, identify and design special tools, produce the necessary documentation, and \n fi nally produce and assemble the components at increasing levels of integration. The \nspace engineering  fi eld is small when compared with: aeronautics, defense, electron-\nics,    or information technologies, and most space engineering production methods \nare taken from any of these mentioned engineering  fi elds. Nevertheless, there are \nsome production engineering areas where space is unique; for example, large, slen-\nder, deployable structures    that cannot operate except in the weightlessness, and \nvacuum of space. It is in these specialized areas where space missions could push \nthe state of the art in production technology. If a new space mission requires to push \nthe state of the art, and to reduce mission risk   , it is necessary to provide time and \nmoney enough to develop the necessary know-how before the mission is approved. \nIn this case specialized technology development activities will run in parallel to the \narchitectural de fi nition phases    of the new space mission and the architectural \nde fi nition phases could not  fi nish until the new production techniques have been \nmatured enough to provide credibility to the estimations of performances and costs. \nIt is extremely risky to start a new space project without having mastered all the \nrequired new production technologies. The issue of technology maturity is treated \nin detail in Section   4.9.3    . \n\n Veri fi cation    engineering is the process of con fi rming that the system meets the \napplicable requirements   . Veri fi cation engineering    includes:\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n39Space Disciplines\n\n   The iterative checking that the consumer    needs are properly captured in formal \u2022 \ndocuments  \n  Con fi rmation that design constraints are respected and that all requirements    are \u2022 \nmet  \n  Acceptance of hardware and software     \u2022 \n  Validation of production processes, equipment and facilities, operations tools, and \u2022 \nprocedures  \n  Con fi rm integrity and performance after particular steps of the mission life    cycle    \u2022 \n\n As with production engineering   , veri fi cation engineering    is also performed in a \nbottom-up    fashion requiring the veri fi cation of progressively larger and more inte-\ngrated assemblies. The testing of large integrated assemblies will require not only the \ntesting of their parts but also the veri fi cation of their interfaces and of the operating \nprocedures to allow the different parts to work correctly together. Finally it will be \nnecessary to verify the end-to-end system working simultaneously with space- and \nground-located elements. \n\n Veri fi cation engineering shall de fi ne, implement and run the tests necessary to \nverify the system requirements and will  fi nally accept the whole system as  fi t to \nbe accepted and paid for. Veri fi cation shall always apply to the performances in \nthe environment that the satellite is going to have to withstand. Figure 2.4 depitcs the \nprocess necessary to arrive to the required veri fi cation approach. It is necessary to \nstart from the requirements \u2014what we want to verify?\u2014 going through the \nveri fi cation methods \u2014how to verify?\u2014 and  fi nishing with the actual facilities that \nwill allow the veri fi cation \u2014where? The selection of test methods and facilities shall \ntake into account, not only the adequacy of the test methods and facilities but also the \ncost and the availability of the facilities. Proper veri fi cation requires that the tests \non-ground shall properly simulate the in-orbit environment. During the architectural \nde fi nition phases it is necessary to demonstrate that all the requirements are veri fi able \nand how they are going to be veri fi ed. All missions will have especially challenging \nrequirements whose veri fi cation will be complex and expensive. The veri fi cation \nmethods for these requirements shall be de fi ned at the same time and with the same \ndedication and detail as the space hardware. Sometimes the space mission requires \nthe veri fi cation of subtle effects that cannot be properly observed under the gravity of \nthe Earth or at atmospheric pressure. There are speci fi c techniques that involve sub-\njecting the space hardware to a simulated space environment and there are other \ntechniques that allow Earth\u2019s gravity to be \u2014 partially \u2014 compensated enabling near-\nrealistic testing to be performed. In some other cases test and analysis will be com-\nbined to provide a reasonable level of veri fi cation in situations that a totally realistic \non-ground veri fi cation of the in-orbit performances is impossible. \n\n Analysis and mathematical simulation are an intrinsic part of the veri fi cation pro-\ncess. The availability    of progressively more sophisticated mathematical analysis and \nsimulation tools and the increasing cost    of complex tests are giving to analysis an \nincreasing role during the veri fi cation process. \n\n In any case the architectural de fi nition phases    of a new space system must establish \nthe overall veri fi cation approach   , including what is going to be veri fi ed, and how and \nwhere it can done. It is necessary to justify the logic of the veri fi cation of the space \nsystem. Development and veri fi cation approaches are discussed in Section   4.9.4    .  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n40 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    2.6.2.   Product assurance \n\n Product assurance    is the engineering discipline devoted to the study, planning, and \nimplementation of activities intended to assure that the design, controls, and tech-\nniques used will result in a satisfactory degree of quality. The quality will be satisfac-\ntory when the availability    of the system is as desired by the consumers   . Availability \nis de fi ned as the ability of a system to be in a state to perform its required function .  \n\n Product assurance    know-how is required during all the phases of the space mis-\nsion, during the architectural de fi nition phases    before the project is approved, and \nduring the detailed design, development, production, and operations of the space \nproducts. Product assurance engineers will be responsible for the level of quality \nof the system under implementation. Once the project is approved product assur-\nance    will:\n\n   Ensure that the approach to product assurance    organization, requirements   , meth-\u2022 \nods, tools, and resources are well de fi ned.  \n  Ensure that the speci fi ed levels of quality are in line with the mission availability    \u2022 \nrequirements   .  \n  Ensure that the parts, materials, and manufacturing procedures are approved for \u2022 \nuse in a space system.  \n  Ensure that the veri fi cation of the end products conform to agreed procedures.    \u2022 \n\n Product assurance    has the dual role of  fi rst de fi ning the rules to ensure that accept-\nable quality is attained and later controlling the work performed by others to certify \nthat the de fi ned rules of quality control are followed by all participants. The control-\nling aspect of product assurance    is clearly a task to be performed only after the fully \nfunded space project begins, but the de fi nition of the rules shall be performed during \nthe architectural de fi nition phases   . The availability    requirements    will directly derive \nof the original requirements of the consumers    and it will be a driver for the mission \ndesign in aspects such as the number of satellites, numerical reliability, redundancy \nphilosophy, or satellite life requirements. The impact of availability in space system \ndesign is discussed in detail in Section   5.5.6    . All space projects include trade-off    \nbetween project risk    and cost   , and the mission sponsor   , who  fi nally is the authority \nthat provides the funds, will de fi ne the levels of risk avoidance and the cost targets, \nand will provide guidelines on cost versus risk trade-off. Different types of proj-\nects have different levels of criticality, and can tolerate different levels of risk. \n\nWhat? How? Where?\n\nAccommodation between\ntechnical, cost and\nschedule reasons\n\nIdentify requirements\nto be verified\n\nSelect verification\nmethod\n\nIdentify the facilities\nand moment for\n\nverification\n\nFigure 2.4. Verification Approach (System Engineering, ECSS-E-10, ESA 1996).\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\n\n\n41Space Disciplines\n\nConsequently they will have different levels of product assurance. Section   4.6     \n discusses criticality, Section   4.8     discusses project cost, and Section   4.9     discusses \nproject risk. Risk management is the responsibility of the project manager    and the \nrole of the product assurance expert will be to clearly provide the availability implica-\ntion of design decisions like elimination of redundancy or the use of lower-quality \nelectrical components.  \n\n    2.6.3.   Satellite  fl ight operations    \n\n To operate the satellite is to handle it so that it performs its intended function. All \nactivities related to the planning, execution, and evaluation of the control of the satel-\nlite when in orbit are the domain of  fl ight operations    engineering. Flight operations \nimply the following set of activities:\n\n   Monitoring of the status of the satellite and all its instruments    by downlinking    and \u2022 \ninspecting information on its status.  \n  Programming and uplinking    of \u201cstandard\u201d or expected activities required by the \u2022 \nsatellite; for example, perform a required orbit control    maneuver, a scheduled cali-\nbration    that requires special satellite commanding or prearranged uplinking of \nupdated in-orbit software   .  \n  Establishment of observation plans and uplinking of the commands to allow the \u2022 \nsatellite to perform observations as requested by the consumers. Instruments that \ndo not acquire data in a systematic and predictable fashion will require this.  \n  Analysis of anomalous situations detected in the satellite and uplinking    of com-\u2022 \nmands as needed to ensure the recovery of the detected nonnominal situation \nallowing the continuation of the space mission.  \n  Safe disposal of the satellite at the end of the mission.    \u2022 \n\n Before the satellite is launched, operations engineering requires the preparation of \nthe documentation to operate the satellite, the training of the personnel to perform it, \nthe validation    operations procedures and operations system, the day-to-day opera-\ntions execution including the logistic support, and the disposal of the satellite. \nOperations engineers are also responsible for progressively activating the satellite\u2019s \ncomponents \u2013 including instruments    \u2013 and characterizing their in-orbit behavior. This \nwill include the in-orbit  fi nal veri fi cation of the behavior of the satellite. Satellite \noperations    only start when the satellite is launched. Furthermore, satellite operations    \nalso require a comprehensive de fi nition of the satellite and a thorough understanding \nof its functioning. This means, a detailed de fi nition of satellite operations can only be \ndone rather late during the process of implementation of the space mission. \nNevertheless, satellite operations engineering support is necessary from day one of \nthe architectural de fi nition phases    of a space mission well before the mission is \napproved. This is necessary because when any possible new mission is considered, \nthere are already three things that the mission consumer    has already made clear:\n\n   What quality of mission products    they want?  \u2022 \n  What quantity and frequency of data they want?  \u2022 \n  How they want the mission products    \u2013 the instrument observations \u2013 to be acquired \u2022 \nand delivered?    \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n42 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n The desires of the consumers    on mission products    acquisition and delivery will \ndrive a cascade of requirements    on the way the space mission will be operated, for \nexample, level of satellite autonomy   , and satellite modes    of operation. All this \nrequirements will be taken into account in the de fi nition of the mission architecture \nand in the costing of the possible space mission. The cost    of mission operations   , \nespecially if a long mission life    is required, is a sizable part of the total cost of space \nmission implementation. \n\n The overall operational data  fl ow    \u2013 satellite and ground \u2013 is analyzed in Chapter   11    . \nThat chapter analyzes the design decisions and the design interaction that impact the \nsatellite in-orbit data  fl ow, and the communications from and to the satellite. The \ndesign of the operational ground segment    is discussed especially in Section   11.2.1    .  \n\n    2.6.4.   Satellite data output processing \n\n Most previous texts and standards on satellite engineering consider the delivery of the \nsatellite instrument output as just another part of satellite operations    engineering; \nnevertheless this text will always separate the processing and distribution of the data \nproduced by the instruments   . The knowledge required to operate a satellite requires \na thorough understanding of the satellite and of the space environment   , while the \nknowledge required in the processing and distribution of the data produced by the \ninstruments is more related to the sciences and applications practiced by the consum-\ners    of the mission products   . Section   7.1.4     introduces the data  fl ows in a space mission \nand justi fi es in detail this separation between operations of the space mission and \ninstruments output data processing and distribution. This text will analyze in Chapter   12     \nthe instrument output data  fl ow   . \n\n The processing and distribution of the data output of the instruments    include:\n\n   The development of processing algorithms that progressively transforms the raw \u2022 \ndata into calibrated and corrected data in instruments    units; for example, the algo-\nrithms that provide calibrated and corrected radiances arriving to the instrument.  \n  To develop the algorithms that transform the corrected data produced by the \u2022 \ninstruments    into data meaningful for the consumer    of the mission; for example, \ninto sea surface temperatures.  \n  To establish and maintain data networks allowing access and distribution of the \u2022 \ndata and providing interfaces to receive requests from the mission consumers   , and \nto provide the requested data in the ways desired by the consumers.  \n  To have a long-term data maintenance system that would act as a repository of the \u2022 \nmission\u2019s results, allowing continuous improvement in the science produced from \nthe mission.    \n\n Space missions are intended to provide the information required by the consumers    \nand most space mission ideas start as a vision in the mind of a consumer   , not in the \nmind of a space engineer. As soon as the architectural de fi nition phases    start, one of the \nmost important tasks is to create mathematical algorithms that relate satellite and \ninstrument performances with the  fi nal performances required by the consumers. These \nalgorithms will be fundamental for the speci fi cation and design of the space mission \nand will allow its correct design and the correct estimation of the cost    and risk   .  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\n\n\n43Space Disciplines\n\n    2.6.5.   Cost engineering    \n\n Cost engineering    is the technical discipline whose aim is to provide cost    estimations. \nCost estimation is de fi ned as \u201cthe process leading to the determination of a project\u2019s \nexpected cost.\u201d \n\n Cost engineers provide cost    estimates for speci fi c space missions under consider-\nation. They employ two types of methods: bottom-up    and parametric. Bottom-up \nmethods make detailed analyses of all the tasks necessary for implementing the mis-\nsion. Parametric methods correlate costs with parameters like satellite mass    and satel-\nlite and payload complexity. These methods are discussed in detail in Section   4.8    . \n\n Cost estimations are fundamental in the architectural de fi nition phases    of a new \nspace project for two reasons:\n\n   To establish the mission\u2019s  fi nancial feasibility  \u2022 \n  To choose cost optimal solutions among the alternative architectures under \u2022 \nconsideration    \n\n Cost estimates help determine if it is feasible to ful fi ll the consumer   \u2019s minimum \nrequirements    within the guidelines provided by the sponsor   . This is a task of maxi-\nmum importance for avoiding possible future cost    overruns. \n\n Cost estimates are crucial for selecting among possible alternative architectures. \nIn order to determine the least-expensive alternative ful fi lling the requirements   , or the \nhighest-performing alternative with respect to cost    constraints, it is essential to be \nable to make use of accurate and reliable tools allowing credible cost estimates of the \ndifferent alternatives under consideration. The  fl exibility provided by parametric \nmethods make them especially appropriate for this purpose. \n\n The aim of the architectural de fi nition phases    of a new space mission is to estab-\nlish the desirability and feasibility of the mission itself, since no  fi rm decision for \nactual implementation has yet been made. During these early phases there is still no \nde fi nitive contractual agreement between the supplier    and the customer   , and cost    \nquotations provided by the supplier are not normally legally binding   . On the other \nhand early cost estimations are very important because customer and sponsor    will use \nany cost estimations received for deciding on the mission\u2019s real desirability. These \nestimates will also serve for long-term  fi nancial planning. The customer\u2019s and sup-\nplier\u2019s distinct cost engineering    teams frequently produce parallel cost estimations.   \n\n    2.7.   The consumer   : the scientist behind the mission \n\n The consumer   \u2019s scienti fi c domain will have its own body of knowledge and accepted \nanalytical procedures necessary for properly interpreting the mission\u2019s output. The \nmission\u2019s ultimate aim is to satisfy the consumer, and its overall design requires some \nunderstanding of the consumer\u2019s scienti fi c area and intentions. \n\n The architectural de fi nition stages of any space mission require mutual accom-\nmodation among the consumer   \u2019s requirements   , the sponsor   \u2019s constraints, and the \ntechnical realities governing the supplier   . The architect   , then, will frequently inter-\nact with the consumer in these early stages. It is not the architect\u2019s obligation to \nbecome an expert in the consumer\u2019s scienti fi c domain, but it is his duty to under-\nstand the users\u2019 needs well enough to provide them with the best design alternatives. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n44 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nTo  provide the consumer with the best design, end-to-end mission performance \nsimulation models must be created for the different architectures under consider-\nation. In order to deliver mission performance in the language and with the units \nfamiliar to the consumer, these models should include modules that are based on the \nconsumer\u2019s scienti fi c domain. End-to-end performance simulation models    will be \nrevisited in Sections   3.4.2    ,   5.6    , and   8.5    .        \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n45M.A. Aguirre, Introduction to Space Systems: Design and Synthesis, Space Technology Library 27, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3, \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n              Keywords    Requirements Engineering,   Specifications Engineering,   Nested Systems,  \n System Layers,   Value Engineering    \n\n Figure    1.2 of Chapter   1     put the customer    at the center of relationships with the other \nthree actors: with the consumer    through the requirements; with the sponsor    through \nthe constraints; and with the supplier    through the design, which in turn responds to the \nrequirements and the constraints. This and the next chapter \u2013 Chapter   4     \u2013 will discuss \nhow the customer handles the requirements and constraints. Section   1.2     de fi ned the \nconsumer as the end-user of the system\u2019s output, and who expresses the desired quan-\ntity, quality, and delivery mode of the data to be produced. These desires will create \nrequirements   . Requirements can be de fi ned as needs or expectations that are formally \nstated and declared obligatory. Requirements are collected in speci fi cations    that can be \nde fi ned as a document stating requirements. That is, needs become requirements that \nare collected in speci fi cations, which become the document, used to formally verify if \nthe consumer\u2019s needs will be correctly addressed by the system being implemented. \n\n This chapter begins by analyzing the recursive nature of systems    and how they \nconsist of smaller subsystems and assemblies. This recursive nature demands the \nestablishment of different levels of speci fi cations    applicable to the different levels of \nthe system\u2019s formal breakdown \u2013 from the more general to the more detailed. The \nnext section provides a description of the different types of requirements    and the \ntypes of speci fi cations and how the style of requirements and speci fi cations evolve \nduring the process of de fi ning the mission. The next section examines requirements \nengineering    and how to create, modify, and maintain speci fi cations. The chapter ends \nby looking at the issue of value engineering   ; that is, how to identify the most impor-\ntant requirements and how to quantify the utility of the mission for the consumers    in \nterms of those requirements. \n\n    3.1.   Levels of system decomposition \n\n Section   1.8     de fi ned system as a set of interrelated or interacting elements, normally the \nobject of a project and being implemented by a single authority. Each part of a system, \nhowever, can be considered as a system in itself made up of smaller parts. This process \ncan be repeated until arriving at units that can no longer be meaningfully divided. \n\n    Chapter 3   \n\n Requirements, Speci fi cations, and Design       \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n46 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nFigure   1.3     analyzed design as a recursive process, which starts from a high level of \nabstraction and generality, and progressively becomes more concrete and speci fi c. \n\n To provide logic to this cascade of progressively more detailed decompositions, in \nspace system engineering the following designations for distinct layers are used:\n\n    \u2022 System : as de fi ned above. It is the highest-level division.  \n   \u2022 Segment : a segment is a  fi rst-level division of the space system into three large \nblocks: space segment, ground segment,    and launch segment.  \n   \u2022 Element : de fi ned in Section   1.7    ; represents a division of each segment into major \nfunctional blocks: instrument, satellite platform   , launcher   , operation center, data \nground processing center   , etc.  \n   \u2022 Subsystems : division of the elements into sets of items grouped by engineering \ndomains, i.e., the thermal subsystem   , the structural subsystem    of the satellite\u2019s \nplatform,    \u2026.  \n   \u2022 Assembly : a combination of parts that forms a functional entity; for example, an \nantenna pointing    mechanism.  \n   \u2022 Parts : the individual components of any assembly: electrical motors, bearings, \nmechanical or electronic parts, \u2026.    \n\n An additional term, \u201ccomponent,\u201d introduced in Section   1.8    , is used in this book \nas a generic term referring to lower-level layers of a system including subsystems, \nassemblies, or parts, and not to de fi ne a speci fi c level of system\u2019s segmentation. \n\n This logic for system segmentation goes hand-in-hand with a nested hierarchy of \nresponsibilities, with those responsible for one layer delivering components to the \nlayer just above while taking delivery of lower layer components from lower-layer \nsuppliers. The number of layers employed in this hierarchy of responsibilities \ndepends on the size of the system. Smaller systems will likely entail a smaller number \nof layers than larger ones, and projects may or may not use segments or subsystems \nlayers for de fi ning speci fi c levels of responsibility. Figure  3.1  provides a graphical \nrepresentation of the mentioned nested hierarchy of responsibilities and their corre-\nsponding layers described in the text above. \n\n Whatever the number and names of the decomposition layers employed, each \ninterface between layers de fi nes a set of relationships of several supplier organiza-\ntions supplying products to a costumer organization that is responsible for accepting \nand integrating them. Using the same terminology introduced in Section   1.3     and \nFigure   1.2    , there is a customer    to supplier    relationship    between each upper and lower \nlayer of Figure  3.1 .  \n\n At each interface of this  fi gure, the customer    organization, will be responsible for \nthe integration of the products delivered by the different suppliers, until the  fi nal sup-\nplier    \u2013 the industrial prime contractor    responsible of the whole system \u2013 delivers it to \nthe  fi nal customer that will accept and put the entire system at the service of the con-\nsumer   . For the system to be able to adequately answer the consumer\u2019s needs, this \ncascade of responsibilities    must produce a corresponding cascade of speci fi cations   . In \nline with this hierarchy of system and subsystems   , the derivation of requirement and \nthe design is always done top-down    (Figure   1.5    ). For example, an overall requirement \non instrument pointing    will be apportioned between lower-level requirements    on atti-\ntude control   , manufacturing and assembly accuracies, materials outgassing, gravity    \nof fl oading, thermal control,    and thermoelastic distortion. The cascade of speci fi cations \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n47Requirements, Specifications, and Design\n\nand requirements will go hand in hand with the cascade of responsibilities and interac-\ntions depicted in Figure  3.1 . At each interface between layers, those responsible for the \nhigher level \u2013 the customer at that interface \u2013 will provide a set of requirements to \nthose responsible for the lower level, who will be acting as his supplier\n\n   At the top of the pyramid, the consumer    is responsible for making his expectations \u2022 \nclear. The consumer must also be aware of the constraints, ( fi nancial caps, for \ninstance) which the sponsor    has imposed on the system.  \n  The highest-level customer    \u2013 normally the space agency \u2013 will discuss and reach \u2022 \nagreements with the consumer    about their needs and expectations and will formal-\nize these in a mission requirement document stating the customer\u2019s commitments \nwith respect to the consumer, and reconciling consumer\u2019s needs with the con-\nstraints imposed by the sponsor   .  \n  The customer    will create the highest-level system requirement document   , which \u2022 \nmust clearly specify what requirements    the system must ful fi ll. Once the system is \nimplemented, this document will be used to ensure that the system is  fi t for pur-\npose and can be accepted and paid for.  \n  The  fi rst-level supplier    \u2013 the space segment prime contractor    \u2013 will discuss and \u2022 \naccept the system requirement document   . Using that document as legally binding   , \nthe supplier shall design and implement the system and verify to the satisfaction \nof the customer    that the implemented system actually ful fi lls the requirements   .  \n  In turn, the  fi rst-level supplier    is responsible for establishing the requirements    and \u2022 \nconstraints for the second-level supplier in charge of delivering the respective \ncomponents or subsystems. When the work is complete, the  fi rst-level supplier \nwill also be responsible for validating that the  fi nished component or subsystem    \nmeets speci fi cations    and it can be accepted and paid for.  \n  The second \u2013 and successive \u2013 level supplier    will specify needs to lower-level \u2022 \nsuppliers, for example, the purchase of components such as space-quali fi ed electri-\ncal motors or other electronic components for use in the satellite subsystem    they \nare supplying. As before, the second-level supplier is also responsible for valida-\ntion    and payment of the delivered components.     \n\nProduct: subsystem or part\n\nUpper layer\n\nLower layer\n\nLayer being considered\n\nSupplier of\nproduct\n\nCustomer integrating the \nlower level product\n\nConsumer\n\nIntegration into system or subsystem\n\nHighest layer\n\nFinal delivery of working system for Consumer use\n\nSupplier of the integrated \nsystem to the upper layer\n\nIntegration into end-to-end system\n\nFinal Customer accepting \nend-to-end system\n\nFinal Customer supplying end-\nend system to Consumer\n\n  Figure 3.1.

Speci fi cation and requirements types \n\n This section and its subsections follow the terminology and approach of the European \nCoordination for Space Standardization (ECSS   ). \n\n The speci fi cations serve two main purposes:\n\n   First: to ensure that the design of the system and all its elements adequately ful fi lls \u2022 \nthe end-user\u2019s requirements. This process is represented by the descending  design  \nline of the V-scheme shown in Figure   1.5     and which advances from the general to \nthe particular.  \n  Second: to con fi rm that each individual component and the whole system properly \u2022 \nmeet their requirements,  fi rst in isolation and later with respect to the components \nit interfaces with. This is the ascending  veri fi cation  line of Figure   1.5    , which \nadvances from the particular to the general.    \n\n    3.2.1.   Speci fi cation types \n\n A speci fi cation is a document expressing requirements for designing, developing, and \nvalidating the system being implemented. A speci fi cation can indicate requirements \nassociated with activities, such as tests or processes; or with product performances, \nsuch as expected numerical or nonnumerical performance parameters. This section \nwill analyze the different kinds of speci fi cations and how they are progressively \nde fi ned as the mission\u2019s design advances. \n\n    3.2.1.1.   Mission statements and mission requirements documents \n A system\u2019s \u201cmission\u201d is the speci fi c task, duty, or function it is designed to accom-\nplish. In order to begin the process of de fi nition, therefore, the system\u2019s mission must \nbe explained. The initial document of this task, often called the \u201cMission Statement   ,\u201d \noutlines the needs and objectives that the system must eventually ful fi ll. The con-\nsumer    creates the document as the collective whose initial needs gave rise to the \nmission and who will be the eventual end-user of the completed system. The mission \nstatement\u2019s aim is to promote a possible new space endeavor; it is primarily a descrip-\ntive document and cannot be considered a speci fi cation, in the sense that it is not a \nformal collection of requirements   . \n\n As the process of de fi nition advances, the mission statement    will generate a second \ndocument usually known as the \u201cMission Requirements Document      \u201d where the initial \nvague needs become progressively more concrete \u2013 and often numeric \u2013 require-\nments   . This document will list the end-to-end requirements necessary for implement-\ning the system outlined by the consumers    in the previous document. These \nrequirements will establish the fundamental needs of the consumers in terms of:\n\n    1.    Mission products quality, what to deliver  \n    2.    Mission products quantity, how much to deliver  \n    3.    Mission products delivery responsiveness   , how to deliver     \n\n Hence, the mission requirements document    formalizes and con fi rms the commit-\nments obtained from the customer    by the consumer   . \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n49Requirements, Specifications, and Design\n\n On the other hand, the consumer    does not normally pay for the system and it is the \nsponsor   \u2019s role to provide the funds directly to the space agency, that is, the customer   . \nObviously, the customer will try to execute the mission requirements document    to the \nbest of its ability but the mission must be implemented according to the constraints \nestablished by the sponsor, who wields ultimate authority to cancel a project that \nexceeds the allocated cost   . The customer\u2019s role as an intermediary between the con-\nsumer and the sponsor, also explains why the customer, and not the consumer, usually \nwrites the mission requirements document, which, however, must be written from the \nconsumer\u2019s perspective. If the consumer is a collective of scientists, the document \nshall be written from the perspective of the science to be produced. Like the mission \nstatement   , the mission requirements document plays an important part in promoting \nthe mission. This means that the document shall contain proportionally long chapters \ndescribing and justifying the mission and explaining its purpose and advantages. \nThese descriptive chapters will supplement other chapters that include the user\u2019s \nneeds and the derived mission requirements   . \n\n Operational missions    (Section   4.5.4    ) \u2013 such as operational meteorology    \u2013 are pro-\nmoted and  fi nanced by a single entity acting as both consumer    and sponsor   . This \nsponsor/consumer would still depend on a customer    (a space agency) for the develop-\nment and implementation of the system, but the consumer/sponsor would control the \nfunds and system needs, would write its own mission requirements document,    and \nwould establish priorities. Taking into account the preliminary de fi nition work under-\ntaken by the customer and the supplier   , the entity acting as consumer/sponsor will \ndiscuss and negotiate with the customer which elements are feasible and which are \nnot, and this might entail changes to the mission requirements documents regarding \nperformances, available funds, or programmatic constraints   . \n\n Neither mission statements nor mission requirements documents shall suggest or \nspecify a design, though they almost always assume an observation technique. This \nis so because in order to propose a mission addressing a speci fi c scienti fi c or applica-\ntion domain, it is necessary to explain how the events of interest could be observed, \nthat is, what techniques could be used to acquire the information required. As a result \nof having to de fi ne the observing technique   , the mission requirements document    must \ninclude not only details on the expected quality, quantity, and mode of delivery of the \nscienti fi c or operational observations, but must also contain some key engineering \nrequirements    concerning the instrumentation considered compulsory by the con-\nsumer    for the ultimate ful fi llment of the mission\u2019s aims.  \n\n    3.2.1.2.   The customer    requirements document as preliminary technical \nspeci fi cation    \n\n The System Requirements Document    is the highest-level speci fi cation produced by \nthe customer   . This document details speci fi cations    for the space system as a whole \nand is addressed to the system\u2019s prime contractor    acting as the leader of the supplier    \norganization. It describes the system\u2019s objectives, including, amongst others, techni-\ncal performances, qualities, the quantity and delivery mode for the data produced, \nneeded availability   , delivery time, engineering requirements,    and the duration of the \nmission. Some of the requirements contained in this document will be derived from \nthe contents of the mission requirements document    described above, but many will \nbe new. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n50 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n Initially, the aim of the document is not to produce a  fi xed and legally binding    \nde fi nition of the mission but to gradually reach reasonable design compromises that \nbalance the consumer   \u2019s requirements    with the constraints imposed by the sponsor   . \nGiven the need to avoid a premature establishment of  fi nal requirements, the system \nrequirements document    will begin as a \u201cPreliminary Technical Speci fi cation   .\u201d This \ndocument shall contain a complete set of provisional technical requirements. The \npreliminary technical speci fi cation is produced early in the process of de fi ning the \nmission\u2019s architecture and is used for exploring potential concepts: evaluating them \nand selecting preferred alternatives. Thus, it shall provide requirements with a certain \ndegree of permissible  fl exibility. \n\n The preliminary technical speci fi cation core will be the technical requirements    for \nall the highest-level elements of the end-to-end system, with special emphasis upon \nthe requirements of the observables    and instruments   . A preliminary technical \nspeci fi cation should not offer or refer to speci fi c design solutions, though it should \nbegin with the observing techniques, that is, with the instrument concept proposed by \nthe consumers    in the mission requirements document   . The preliminary technical \nspeci fi cation could also include requirements related to the future project\u2019s program-\nmatic environment, as well as general requirements derived from accepted principles \nexpressed by the assorted engineering disciplines involved in the system\u2019s design and \nimplementation. For example   , the speci fi cation will provide: the required level of \nquality assurance, the need to use a speci fi c launcher    for the mission, or the safety \nmargins    required in the estimation of the satellite\u2019s mass or electrical power needs. \n\n The preliminary technical speci fi cation is already a part of the business agreement \nbetween the customer    and the supplier   ; so the supplier must provide well-documented \nconcepts capable of ful fi lling the requirements    included in the preliminary technical \nspeci fi cation. Nevertheless, these requirements are only used before the project has \nbeen fully approved and contain provisional,  fl exible requirements that are sometimes \nvague or qualitative; words like \u201coptimize\u201d or \u201cminimize,\u201d for example, are perfectly \nacceptable in preliminary technical speci fi cations   . Because of this acceptable vague-\nness a preliminary technical speci fi cation cannot be used to validate a satellite that is \nbeing delivered.  \n\n    3.2.1.3.   The customer    system requirements document    as technical speci fi cation    \n A Technical Speci fi cation    is a document expressing requirements for designing, \ndeveloping, and eventually validating and accepting the system being implemented. \nThe technical speci fi cation evolves directly from the preliminary technical speci fi cation \nand must be free of all ambiguities. This evolution is driven by the supplier   \u2019s analysis \nof needs, including suggested possible alternative design concepts, and by the cus-\ntomer   \u2019s continued re fi nement of the original concept. The customer shall balance the \nconsumer   \u2019s requirements   , the sponsor   \u2019s constraints, and the design concepts of the \nsupplier. This progressive process of accommodation between ends and means and \nthe eventual elimination of ambiguities is depicted in Figure  3.2 .  The creation of the \nsystem requirements document      and its gradual transformation into a document \navoiding all imprecision and ambiguities is by far the most important task for \nthe persons acting as mission architect      for the customer .  \n\n The technical speci fi cation    de fi nes the requirements    for the selected solution and \nis a legally binding    document that will form part of the  fi nal contract for the system\u2019s \n\n\n\n51Requirements, Specifications, and Design\n\nimplementation. The technical speci fi cation is the  fi rm basis for providing credibility \nto the performance, risk,    and cost    estimations needed for a well-informed decision on \nwhether or not to approve a fully funded project. When the project is nearing comple-\ntion, the technical speci fi cation becomes the document of reference for the accep-\ntance of the implemented system and for determining if the supplier    has ful fi lled his \nobligations and can be fully paid. All these reasons make it essential for the technical \nspeci fi cation to be precise and utterly unambiguous. \n\n The technical speci fi cation    should contain general information related both to the \ncontext of the document itself and to the context of the project as a whole. The former \nshould include items such as: the owner, distribution, management rules, scope, refer-\nences, and de fi nitions of terms and abbreviations. Information related to the project\u2019s \ncontext should include: a summary of mission aims as put forth in the mission \nrequirements document   , programmatic framework    and programmatic constraints   , and \ndetails on different aspects of the system or life cycle. \n\n The most important component of the system requirements document is the inven-\ntory of technical requirements    it contains.

These de fi ne how products are requested from the \u2022 \nspace system and how the data produced is transformed into mission products    \ndistributed to the consumers   .  \n  Product assurance   , and assembly integration and veri fi cation requirements. These \u2022 \nde fi ne quality levels demanded by the mission\u2019s physical implementation includ-\ning reliability or availability    levels, required standards of quality, and speci fi cations \nfor the manufacture, assembly, and testing of the satellite, and other space system \ncomponents.  \n  Interface requirements. On occasion the satellite must interface with elements not \u2022 \nforming part of the mission\u2019s principal design and implementation effort; for \nexample, with a speci fi c launcher or existing ground station. These existing ele-\nments will impose their own interface requirements    on the rest of the end-to-end \nsystem. In other cases, the mission might employ an already existing instrument \nor one being designed in a different programmatic framework   . A detailed Interface \nRequirement Document will be needed to ensure the instrument\u2019s integration into \nthe satellite\u2019s design.    \n\n The level of detail in the system requirements document shall be higher for require-\nments applying to more innovative elements or components (for example, require-\nments related to a new instrument), while requirements applying to conservative \ncomponents that are likely to be very similar for similar missions do not need to be \nde fi ned to a very high level of detail. This is the case of design requirements on well-\nproven subsystems like electrical power or satellite structures. At any rate, the level of \nde fi nition must be high enough to allow a reliable estimation of cost, schedule, and \nprogrammatic risks for the binding agreement between the supplier    and the customer   .  \n\n    3.2.1.4.   Industrial satellite requirement speci fi cation \n The  fi rst-level supplier    \u2013 the prime contractor    \u2013 will produce a speci fi cation in \nresponse to the system requirements document    produced by the customer   . The \nstructure of this speci fi cation will be similar to the structure of the customer\u2019s sys-\ntem requirements document though much more detailed, and each requirement \ndetailed in the original document will generate several derived requirements    in the \ndocument produced by the  fi rst-level supplier. The latter will be written with the \nproposed design in mind and the resulting design will imply speci fi c sets of require-\nments and allocation of functions    regarding the subsystems of the satellite being \nspeci fi ed. \n\n This speci fi cation will focus on the satellite and is likely to consider elements such \nas the ground stations    or the launcher    as beyond the supplier   \u2019s control and external to \nhis effort. In line with this approach the speci fi cation will treat these external elements \nas having interface requirements    needing to be proposed, discussed, and agreed upon, \nbut will not impose any requirements on their internal functions. In some missions, \nsome or all the instruments    to be carried by the satellite also fall outside the responsi-\nbility of the satellite\u2019s prime contractor    and will be treated as external elements \nspeci fi ed only through their interface requirements   . \n\n\n\n53Requirements, Specifications, and Design\n\n The next step is a thorough review of the Satellite Requirements Speci fi cation    by \nthe customer    and the  fi rst-level supplier    with the aim of reaching an agreement on the \nviability of the mission which demonstrates con fi dence that it can be implemented \nthrough a design with a reasonable level of risk   , within the imposed cost    and schedul-\ning constraints and that it would ful fi ll the consumer   \u2019s requirements   .  \n\n    3.2.1.5.   System support speci fi cations    \n The supplier    will also produce supplementary speci fi cations    as needed, covering in detail \naspects such as thermomechanical or electrical and electronics design guidelines. \nSpeci fi cations concerning speci fi c areas that apply to the entire satellite project are known \nas \u201cSystem Support Speci fi cations   .\u201d Taking into account the importance of the veri fi cation \nof test approach and test methods in determining the credibility of the mission\u2019s cost    and \nperformance estimations, de fi ning test requirements    is another crucial step.  \n\n    3.2.1.6.   Interface requirements speci fi cations \n As mentioned above, certain elements interfacing with the satellite fall outside the \nmain supplier   \u2019s purview. Each one of these elements will be de fi ned by an Interface \nRequirements Speci fi cation   , provided by the customer    to the supplier, which the sup-\nplier will respond to with documents specifying the interfaces from the satellite\u2019s \npoint of view. As also mentioned earlier, interfaces with the launcher    and ground seg-\nment    must be speci fi ed, and sometimes with the instruments    as well, or with any other \nsatellite unit that might be furnished directly by the customer to the supplier.  \n\n    3.2.1.7.   Speci fi cation production, project phases, and project milestones \n A project\u2019s phases and their corresponding milestones have been described in Figure \n  1.6    . The mission statement    is normally produced before the start of Phase 0   . The  fi rst \ndraft of the mission requirements document    is produced at the end of Phase 0. The \n fi rst draft of the system requirements as a preliminary technical speci fi cation    is pro-\nduced at the end of the Phase 0 and is updated and improved during the  fi rst half of \nPhase A   . The System Requirements Speci fi cation progressively becomes a technical \nspeci fi cation as Phase A advances. During the second half of Phase A the number of \n fl exible requirements    is greatly reduced and the end of Phase A should coincide with \na system requirements document    that has de fi nitively become a technical speci fi cation \nand that is totally free of ambiguities. The Preliminary Requirements Review    at the \nend of Phase A must produce a well-consolidated system requirements document as \nthis is the only way of providing credible cost   , risk,    and schedule    estimations, often \ncrucial at that stage. The industrial satellite requirements speci fi cations, the Satellite \nSupport Speci fi cation, and the interface requirements speci fi cation shall be agreed to \nduring the System Requirements Review    that takes place a few months after the \nbeginning of Phase B.   \n\n    3.2.2.   Requirements types \n\n Requirements can be divided along different lines:\n\n   Depending on the perspective of the requirements, they can be expressed in \u2022 \n science or in engineering terms.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n54 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  Requirements can be divided into rigid and  fl exible groups. As explained in the \u2022 \nprevious section,  fl exible requirements are crucial to reaching a convergence \namong consumer    requirements, sponsor    constraints, and supplier    design, while \nrigid requirements are needed for providing credibility to the performance and cost \nestimations.  \n  Depending on their aims, requirements can also be divided into three major cate-\u2022 \ngories: functional, performance, or design requirements.    \n\n These three categories will be discussed below. \n\n    3.2.2.1.   Science versus engineering requirements \n Requirements can be expressed in either scienti fi c or engineering terms. Consumer    \nwishes regarding quality are expressed in terms of observables   , such as ocean circula-\ntion accuracy by m/s of ocean current, wind recovery accuracy by m/s of wind. The \nmission requirements document will contain many requirements \u2013 described from the \nconsumer\u2019s perspective \u2013 in observable \u201cscience related\u201d terms. The instrument \nrequirements such as signal-to-noise ratio or observational bandwidth will be \nexpressed in engineering  fi gures meaningful to instrument designers. The observable-\nrelated quantities will have to be translated into instrument-related quantities and this \nentails the establishment of the observing concept.  \n\n    3.2.2.2.   Rigid versus  fl exible requirements \n To ensure that the requirements do not drive the mission outside its cost or risk \nboundaries, they must be  fl exible; so it is advisable that the highest-level require-\nments always be expressed in terms of ranges instead of as single,  fi xed values. It is \npossible to classify the performance levels indicated by their consumers    into three \ncategories:\n\n   Threshold, the limit at which the observations become ineffectual and are of no \u2022 \nuse for the targeted application  \n  Breakthrough, the value at which a signi fi cant improvement in the application is \u2022 \nachieved  \n  Objective, the observation\u2019s optimal limit    \u2022 \n\n The availability of key mission requirements    in terms of threshold, breakthrough, \nand objective values will provide the required  fl exibility during the earliest stages of \nthe design, allowing mutual adjustments until a balanced set of requirements for all \nthe main mission elements is achieved, and which the design can respond to by  fi tting \nwithin the cost and risk guidelines. This is the moment when the preliminary techni-\ncal speci fi cation    turns into the technical speci fi cation and the prior  fl exibility can \ndisappear. Even after this convergence process it might still be necessary to indicate \nthat some requirements are not yet totally mature, in which case indications such as \n\u201crequirement to be con fi rmed\u201d or \u201cto be de fi ned\u201d can be employed. These markers \ncan be eliminated as the design process   , and hence the evolution of the requirements \nadvances.  \n\n    3.2.2.3.   Functional, performance, and design requirements \n In general, all requirements can be classi fi ed into three categories: functional, perfor-\nmance, and design. Functional requirements, which can be numerical or nonnumerical, \n\n\n\n55Requirements, Specifications, and Design\n\nanswer the question:  what must the system do?  Performance requirements answer \nthe question:  how much?  And they are always expressed numerically. Design \nrequirements answer the question:  how?  And can be numerical or nonnumerical. The \nlatter are not normally related to a speci fi c mission\u2019s needs but rather to accepted \nprocedures of the different engineering disciplines involved in the system\u2019s design \nand implementation.   \n\n    3.2.3.   Requirements for technical speci fi cations \n\n Once the technical speci fi cation    stage has been reached, all the requirements shall \nbecome  fi xed and will share a de fi ned set of features. These must be:\n\n   Clear: describing the required performance, and expressed in quanti fi able terms as \u2022 \nfar as possible.  \n  Veri fi able: in order to provide adequate credibility to the cost value, and should be \u2022 \nwritten with a view of verifying them in a practical way.  \n  Justi fi ed: in terms of the way the requirements are needed for the ful fi llment of \u2022 \nmission\u2019s aims. At every level the customer    must specify the minimum require-\nments necessary for their suppliers to be able to reach the project\u2019s objectives. \nMinimization of requirements is a key factor in minimizing supplier    costs and \nmaximizing supplier responsiveness   .  \n  Con fi gured and traceable: all requirements shall be properly identi fi ed and subject \u2022 \nto con fi guration management    so backward and forward traceability can identify \nwhat lower-level requirements they generate and what higher-level requirements \nthey derive from.  \n  Unambiguous: so that all requirements are utterly unequivocal.  \u2022 \n  Unique: each technical requirement shall appear only once.  \u2022 \n  Identi fi able: each requirement shall be identi fi ed with a unique alphanumeric \u2022 \nreference.  \n  Singular: each unique alphanumeric reference shall apply to a single, separately \u2022 \nstated requirement.  \n  Self-contained: so that each requirement is complete and self-contained, requiring \u2022 \nno supplementary information to understand it.  \n  Consistent: so that no two requirements are in con fl ict with each other.    \u2022 \n\n The need for veri fi cation not only entails differentiating between requirements that \nmust be veri fi ed by analysis versus those to be veri fi ed by testing, but also the choice \nor development of the actual veri fi cation methods. This will be treated in detail in \nSection  3.5 .   \n\n    3.3.   Requirements engineering \n\n The responsibility for system implementation is clearly in the hands of the supplier   , \nas is that of system design, though the latter is usually shared with the system cus-\ntomer   . Nevertheless, the responsibility for system-level speci fi cations is completely \nin the customer\u2019s hands, acting as the consumer   \u2019s architect   . As we are examining the \nprocess of satellite design from the architect   \u2019s perspective, requirements engineering    \n\n\n\n56 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nis given particular emphasis. Proper requirement apportioning and engineering are \nthe architect\u2019s most effective means for helping to reach an ef fi cient de fi nition of the \nmission. \n\n Requirement engineering must ensure the:\n\n   Proper interpretation of the consumer   \u2019s needs  \u2022 \n  Production, discussion, and consolidation of the actual requirements  \u2022 \n  Creation, control, and maintenance of a coherent set of system and lower-level \u2022 \nspeci fi cations  \n  Full traceability of the requirements within the set of speci fi cations, until the  fi nal \u2022 \nveri fi cation closeout, ensuring that each requirement is referred to the adjacent \nupper-level requirement that generated it    \n\n The purpose of requirements engineering is to provide designers with all the \nnecessary data to accurately specify an approach that can satisfy the perceived \nneeds. Requirements engineering    can be considered to have been satisfactorily com-\npleted when all lower levels have accepted their statement of requirements and their \nconsequences have been suf fi ciently evaluated. Customers should agree that the \nproduct de fi ned by these requirements will ful fi ll their needs, and the means for \ndemonstrating that the product will indeed comply with them has been correctly \nidenti fi ed. The primary output of the requirement engineering process is a detailed \nsystem requirements document    agreed upon by the customer    and supplier   , supported \nby suf fi cient supplier-provided documentation demonstrating the feasibility and \nacceptability of all critical areas of the proposed design solution. At each level, \nrequirements must be:\n\n   Captured  \u2022 \n  Analyzed, critically assessed, and validated  \u2022 \n  Apportioned and allocated  \u2022 \n  Maintained    \u2022 \n\n The capture of requirements    requires understanding the consumer   \u2019s expectations \nand entails discussions with the highest-level supplier    to arrive at a complete under-\nstanding of the implications of the requirements on the  fi nal design. The capture pro-\ncess is supported by a functional analysis    for de fi ning the functional elements and \napportioning the corresponding functional requirements    to each element and as well as \nany interactions between them. This combined process of discussions between con-\nsumers    and suppliers and functional analysis will capture all the requirements directly \nrelated to the needs of the particular mission. These \u201cmission-speci fi c requirements\u201d \nwill be supplemented by requirements likely to be repeated from one mission to the \nnext, which deal with accepted practices within the different engineering disciplines. \nThe mission\u2019s speci fi c programmatic framework   , which is de fi ned by the sponsor   , not \nthe consumer, will de fi ne levels of tolerance to failure; hence the product assurance   , \nredundancy, and reliability requirements. The sponsor may also impose requirements \nsuch as the use of a speci fi c launcher. In any case, any new requirements must be \nsubmitted to review in line with the already-mentioned guidelines to ensure that \nunnecessary requirements for the execution of the mission are not included. \n\n The resulting speci fi cation shall be analyzed with an eye to identifying require-\nments that might have a large impact on cost or risk while providing only a marginal \n\n\n\n57Requirements, Specifications, and Design\n\nimprovement in performance. This identi fi cation of potentially expensive  requirements \nshall be applied to the different stages of the system during its entire life cycle, from \nimplementation to disposal, and a critical review of all requirements is crucial for \ndeciding if and in what way they are applicable to the mission under consideration. \nThis will produce a validated list of necessary requirements that are internally \nconsistent. \n\n Higher-level system requirements shall be apportioned to the different subsystems, \nand the resulting derived requirements shall be included in the subsystems\u2019 \nspeci fi cations   . Each higher-level requirement is likely to be apportioned between \nseveral lower-level requirements   . This apportioning may be:\n\n   Functional, in which a higher-level function is broken down into several lower-\u2022 \nlevel ones  \n  Numerical, in which a higher-level performance  fi gure is apportioned between all \u2022 \nthe error sources that will contribute to that higher-level  fi gure, providing one \nspeci fi ed  fi gure for each error source       \n\n These allocations shall be applied in parallel with the functional analysis    and with \nthe progressively more detailed design process   . Requirement apportioning deter-\nmines the level of dif fi culty of the design and implementation task for each indi-\nvidual lower-level contributor to the higher-level overall  fi gure that is being \napportioned. Requirement apportioning is a powerful tool for ensuring a balanced \ndesign that avoids situations in which the requirements of one lower-level contribu-\ntor are more demanding and dif fi cult to ful fi ll than another\u2019s, without correspond-\ningly higher funds or time allocation.  A fair allocation of requirements is one of \nthe customer     \u2019s most effective instruments for optimizing the system . This is \nfurther discussed in Section   5.5.2     for functional apportioning    and Section   5.5.4     for \nnumerical allocation. \n\n During the process of creating speci fi cations    it is a general rule that the supplier    \nat each level may pass a requirement from a higher level down to a lower-tier \n supplier. Any  fl owed-down requirements then become the source of the lower-\nlevel-derived requirements in the appropriate speci fi cations. It is the responsibility \nof the higher-level supplier to ensure consistency and compatibility between \nrequirements at their own and lower levels. It is also the responsibility of the \nhighest-level  supplier \u2013 that means, of the industrial prime contractor    responsible \nof the whole system \u2013 to establish a clear \u201cspeci fi cation tree,\u201d a document that \nshows the relationships between all the speci fi cations for the space system, from \nthe highest to the lowest levels, for each segment of the system. Each high-level \nrequirement will produce a cascade of lower level, more detailed requirements that \nwill drive different parts of the space mission. Figure  3.3  depicts the cascade of \nrequirements    starting from the fundamental classes of needs of the consumer   : data \nquality, data quantity, and the way of delivery of the data. The meaning of the terms \nused is explained in detail in Chapters   8     and   9    , but most of the terms are self-\nexplanatory and adequate to illustrate the \u201ccascade of requirements\u201d resulting from \nthe apportioning of functions and budgets   .  \n\n Requirement maintenance    consists of the processing and documenting of all \nrequirements at each level, as well as the recording of the entire cascade of \nrequirements    derivations. Any change in requirements must be processed and \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n58 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nrecorded in order to guarantee full visibility and traceability of each requirement \nat all levels: from the highest and most comprehensive to the lowest, most detailed \nones. Computerized tools are available to help carry out this task.  \n\n    3.4.   Value engineering \n\n The aim of value engineering    is not to verify if a mission ful fi lls its requirement but \nto determine \u2013 numerically \u2013 how well the mission ful fi lls the consumer   \u2019s needs. \nRequirements are established to ensure that a mission ful fi lls its aims; the corollary is \nthat a mission that ful fi lls all its requirements will ful fi ll its aims. Near the end of the \nmission implementation process, documents known as veri fi cation control documents \nor conformance records provide a list of all the requirements, con fi rm that they have \nbeen implemented, and provide information on how they have been ful fi lled. \nRequirement ful fi llment only provides yes/no testimony, since as far as system vali-\ndation    is concerned, no apparent difference in requirements is relevant beyond \nwhether they have been ful fi lled or not ful fi lled. Nevertheless, throughout the design \nprocess   , and especially during the early stages of mission implementation,  fi gures \nmust be provided to help determine the relative value of alternative designs under \nconsideration for ful fi lling the needs of the consumer.

Example of Cascade of Higher- to Lower-Level Requirements    and Resulting \nImplications on the Satellite and the Mission.       \n\n \n\n\n\n59Requirements, Specifications, and Design\n\nmust be quantitatively measured; that is, numerical measurements of the system\u2019s \neffectiveness must be established in order to ensure that the consumer\u2019s aims for the \nmission are being met. Value engineering consists in the measurement of system \neffectiveness. The primary aim of value engineering is to quantify in numerical terms \nhow well the system meets the mission\u2019s objectives. \n\n    3.4.1.   The different values of requirements \n\n As said in the previous paragraph speci fi cations    are a collection of requirements   . To \nful fi ll his contractual duties the supplier    must demonstrate compliance with all \nrequirements; from this viewpoint all requirements are equal. Nevertheless, some \nrequirements are clearly more important than others:\n\n   Some requirements are absolutely fundamental for the mission to be of any value \u2022 \nto the consumer   ; for example, missions to study weak astronomical events located \nfar away in deep space    have to be sensitive enough to detect them and accurate \nenough to characterize them properly. Clearly the requirements related to accuracy \nand sensitivity would be fundamental for such missions.  \n  Some requirements have major impacts in many aspects of the design; the need to \u2022 \n fl y a satellite at low altitude over the Earth   \u2019s surface will impact not only almost \nevery subsystem    of the satellite but also the overall data  fl ow and the operations \napproach.  \n  Some requirements are both things at the same time: fundamental for the con-\u2022 \nsumer    and impacting many aspects of the design.    \n\n Identifying the most important requirements is not dif fi cult, since they derive \ndirectly from fundamental consumer    needs and because they become the main and \nmost dif fi cult to ful fi ll from the earliest stages of mission\u2019s de fi nition. Design deci-\nsions connected with the ful fi llment of these requirements generate the longest dis-\ncussions and entail the most dif fi cult decision processes. To support the system \nengineering process, the employment of mission effectiveness     fi gures directed toward \nthe ful fi llment of these key requirements    is crucial. Each requirement is always \nunique and addresses a single performance such as the minimum angular resolution \nof the images obtained by the instrument. Nevertheless, mission effectiveness  fi gures \nnormally integrate several key requirements into a single value that should be espe-\ncially meaningful to the consumer, in line with keeping the mission focused on the \nlatter. For example, a good mission effectiveness value for a mission studying global \nvegetation would be the ability to gather high-accuracy estimations of vegetation dry \nmass    in Kg/Ha. This mission effectiveness parameter would integrate many mission \nrequirements   , including several key requirements regarding the instrument and \nground processing. In some cases, on the other hand, a single key requirement might \nalso be a reasonable mission effectiveness parameter. For instance, the weakest \nrecoverable signal of a particular mission is likely to be a speci fi c requirement indi-\ncating the kind of minimum signal capable of being distinguished by the instrument \nfrom among the signal noise, while also being clearly important and meaningful to \nthe consumer.  \n\n\n\n60 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    3.4.2.   System effectiveness metrics \n\n The availability of numerical estimations of mission effectiveness    permits:\n\n   The comparison of alternative concepts and their ranking in terms of the relative \u2022 \nsatisfaction of consumer    needs  \n  The analysis of any mission concept from the perspective of effectiveness versus \u2022 \ncosts or risks, allowing the optimal design points for that concept to be identi fi ed    \n\n For comparisons to be meaningful and to facilitate decision making, a mission cost    \nvalue must be calculated in addition to the mission effectiveness    metric. Cost engi-\nneering    is crucial to the comparative evaluation of alternative concepts, for correctly \nchoosing the best design point, and for ensuring a well-documented decision on \nwhether or not the mission will become a fully funded project.  Mission effectiveness \nand mission cost analysis      are the two sides of the process needed to reconcile \nmission requirements      with programmatic constraints     ,  and this book will dedicate \nample space to comment on them, and to point out their strengths and weaknesses. \nCost will be discussed in Section   4.8     and mission effectiveness in Section   5.6 .    \n\n Figure  3.4  expands on the roles of the actors depicted in Figure   1.2    . This expan-\nsion provides the  fl ow of information among the actors during the architectural \nde fi nition phases   . In line with the account given in Section  3.2.1 , the  fi gure includes \ntwo arrows indicating the expression of needs and requirements; the \u201cmission needs\u201d \narrow represents the consumer   \u2019s requirements as provided to the customer    in the mis-\nsion requirements document   , while the \u201csystem requirements\u201d arrow represents the \ncustomer\u2019s requirements as provided to the supplier    in the system requirements docu-\nment   . The mission effectiveness    models and the cost estimation    models enable the \nassessment and reconciliation of the legitimate \u2013 and contradictory \u2013 needs of con-\nsumer and sponsor   .  \n\n The formulation of a mathematical model epitomizing system effectiveness is also \na positive step because it forces a systematic and detailed analysis of all the design \nfeatures or natural events that will play a role in the mission\u2019s performance. This kind \nof analysis also produces good understanding of the different factors in fl uencing the \nful fi llment of requirements, how these factors can be broken down into lower-level \nfactors, and how all these factors interact.

Mission effectiveness  fi gures can \nalso be divided into the three same groups:\n\n    1.    What to deliver? Output quality  fi gures   , which determine to what extent the mis-\nsion products    are able to provide high-accuracy information about the sources, \nparameters being measured, or targets of observation. High-accuracy information \nallows the consumer    to properly identify and study the relevant observable items.  \n\n    2.    How much to deliver? Output quantity  fi gures   , which determine to what extent the \nmission produces large amounts of data, providing fast coverage of large areas of \ninterest    in a short time, and for how long the mission can provide this service.  \n\n    3.    How to deliver? Responsiveness  fi gures   , which determine how fast the mission \ncan react to the users\u2019 potentially variable observational needs, or how long it takes \nto acquire, process, and deliver the requested data to consumers   .     \n\n Output quality  fi gures    for system effectiveness must be true end-to-end values, \nencompassing the behavior of all the elements involved in delivering the  fi nal mission \nproducts   . This will require collaboration among experts in diverse engineering and \nscienti fi c  fi elds; for example, determination of ocean currents from satellite measure-\nments calls for contributions from ionosphere specialists. Apart from this need for \nmultidisciplinary collaboration, the essence of output quality determination is the \ncreation of good instrument performance models. This will be discussed in more \ndetail in Section   8.7.3    . True end-to-end quality  fi gures    are expressed in the relevant \nobservational units; thus, ocean currents recovery accuracy would be expressed in \nm/s. Instrument requirements, however, are expressed in instrument units: swath, \nbands, noise-to-signal ratio, etc. Analysis of different instrument performance ranges \ncan determine how relaxing or tightening instrument requirement affects the overall \nperformance sensitivity. This is an obligatory step in a project\u2019s early stages for iden-\ntifying optimal alternatives. \n\n Compared with the complication and wide scope of output quality  fi gures, output \nquantity  fi gures are simple to produce and understand and can be generated with the \nsole aid of space engineers. Satellite life and instrument swath    are parameters of this \nkind. The simplicity of these parameters, however, does not keep them from having \ndramatic impact on the whole space system in cases where it is necessary to improve \nthem. To increase an instrument\u2019s  fi eld of view   , for instance, entails increasing its \nsize, its data output, its power consumption,    and its weight, producing a cascade of \neffects on the satellite and the system as a whole. Extensive analysis will have to be \nundertaken to ensure that this change in the  fi eld of view is ef fi cient or even feasible. \nClearly, changes in satellite life would also have a major impact on numerous satel-\nlite components. Satellite life depends on the redundancy approach, reliability \n levels, in-orbit degradation of the materials used, and the amount of consumable \nitems such as fuel. \n\n Some responsiveness     fi gures, such as data delivery delays, are straightforward \nnumerical values. Other measures of responsiveness, for example, the possibility of \nconsumers    to modify their observational needs at will, are not directly numeric and \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n62 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nrequire interaction between consumer    and customer    to reach a clear understanding of \nwhat the real needs are. Demanding responsiveness requirements signi fi cantly \nin fl uence satellite operations   , the design of the overall data  fl ow architecture   , which \nmust take into account data  fl ow from the consumer to the satellite operator, thence \nto the satellite, to information acquisition by the satellite, and back to the ground seg-\nment   , encompassing data processing and  fi nal delivery to the consumer. This will be \nstudied in Sections   8.4.5     and   8.4.6     and again in Chapters   11     and   12    . \n\n Three classes of system effectiveness, with their concomitant examples, have so \nfar been examined, yet Figure  3.4  assumes implicitly a \u201csingle\u201d mission utility value \nthat could be compared against cost. Theoretically the existence of a single well-\nde fi ned value permits the de fi nition of optimal design points. Nevertheless, obtaining \na trustworthy single value for mission utility or system effectiveness is not a realistic \ngoal, due to the dif fi culty of integrating the diverse aspects of mission effectiveness    \ninto a single overall value. This issue, involving ways to produce optimal system \ndesigns, will be discussed further and expanded in Section   5.6    .   \n\n    3.5.   Requirements and veri fi ability \n\n Section  3.2.3  explained how all requirements need to be veri fi able, and that merely \nindicating whether veri fi cation would be accomplished by analysis or testing was not \nenough, and that it is necessary to have in mind practical ways of veri fi cation. Most \nrequirements on the majority of missions can be veri fi ed by means of well-established \nprocedures, and indicating the veri fi cation method is suf fi cient for understanding how \nthe requirement will be veri fi ed and how complicated and expensive it will be. This \nis not always possible, however, and some cases will require intensive efforts to \ndetermine if and how the requirements can be veri fi ed. \n\n Ideally, each item should be tested in an environment identical or very similar to \nconditions in space and demonstrate that it is able to function as required. \nNevertheless, for requirements that are not easily tested, current space sciences analy-\nsis can provide an excellent level of credibility by employing a wise combination of \npartial tests, analysis aimed at an overall view, and tests devised to validate the analy-\nsis. Testing is expensive, and there is a clear tendency toward reducing the number \nand  fi delity levels of tests, despite the obvious increase of risk this entails. \n\n It is possible that a new mission will demand requirements that are dif fi cult or \neven impossible to verify through testing. This can occur for tests associated with two \nprincipal circumstances:\n\n   Tests related to the measurement of subtle physical effects that might be perturbed \u2022 \nby the Earth    environment, especially by the Earth\u2019s gravity     \n  Tests of high-level items such as an entire instrument, a whole satellite, or the \u2022 \ncomplete end-to-end command and data  fl ow network, where available test facili-\nties are too small or would be unable to adequately reproduce the real-life environ-\nment for the entire high-level item    \n\n A good early understanding of how to properly verify the requirements in these \ntwo types of situations will be fundamental for the mission and must be addressed \nwithin the scope of the architectural de fi nition phases   , but the veri fi cation approach    \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\n\n\n63Requirements, Specifications, and Design\n\ncan be complex and dif fi cult to design, cost estimates can be tricky to calculate, and \nestablishing if veri fi cation is even feasible is not always easy. This is another example \n   of the intrinsic contradictions in high-level system design, represented in the \nV-scheme of Figure   1.5    : making the most important design decisions, the highest-\nlevel ones, earliest, when the level of de fi nition is the poorest and when the resources \navailable are the smallest; while actual veri fi cation of those most important design \ndecisions will be performed toward the end of the mission\u2019s implementation. \n\n In missions with special veri fi ability problems, early support from veri fi cation \nspecialists is crucial. This is especially true when the physical effects to be veri fi ed \nare so small that ground testing would be inadequate and the level of con fi dence \nprovided by supporting analysis is weak. Missions whose aim is to research the fun-\ndamental physics of gravity    are of this nature, as are missions that must accurately \nmaintain the relative positions of several satellites  fl ying in formation, or those \ndeploying large and  fl exible structures   . In some cases in which a requirement is \nimpossible to verify, technology demonstration missions are sometimes necessary in \norder to verify techniques in-orbit that are impossible to verify on the ground and are \nfundamental to the eventual success of an ambitious, expensive, and complex \nmission. \n\n It is the duty of the customer    acting as architect    to present the sponsor    and con-\nsumer    with alternative scenarios in which the likely risks and costs are presented \nclearly, in which dif fi cult or impossible-to-verify requirements are properly indicated, \nand practical ways ahead are provided. Then it is up to the sponsor to give the go-\nahead for providing the funds to proceed and to the consumer to accept or reject the \ndistinct scenarios presented. The emphasis on addressing the veri fi cation aspects of a \nproject in the early de fi nition phases is inevitably constrained by the limited available \ninformation. Therefore, the system engineer    must always be thinking ahead toward \nthe later phases, to ensure that he is not responsible for introducing requirements at \nany level that will prove dif fi cult, costly, or even impossible to verify. This dif fi cult \ntask can be summarized as follows:\n\n   If the design of a component, equipment, or subsystem    introduces a signi fi cant \u2022 \nadverse in fl uence upon another part of the system, carefully consider the alterna-\ntive solutions so as to avoid such impacts.  \n  If the adopted design at any level cannot be readily analyzed without having to \u2022 \nmake assumptions that cannot be justi fi ed, consider the alternative solutions that \npermit the analysis to proceed with con fi dence.  \n  If the adopted design at any level cannot be readily tested without unacceptable \u2022 \nrisk and/or cost, consider the alternative solutions that permit the test to proceed.  \n  If the adopted design at any level invokes requirements that cannot be veri fi ed, \u2022 \nchange the design.    \n\n Hence, veri fi cation must be considered throughout all the project\u2019s phases and not \ndismissed as something to be done later. If a system invokes requirements that cannot \nbe veri fi ed, it should not be built.       \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n65M.A. Aguirre, Introduction to Space Systems: Design and Synthesis, Space Technology Library 27, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4, \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n              Keywords    Constraints,   External Environment,   STEP analysis,   Cost Analysis,   Risk \nAnalysis,   Schedule Analysis,   Technical Readiness Levels,   Development Approach,  \n Model Philosophy,   Space Project Aim    \n\n Systems    are designed according to speci fi cations and are also veri fi ed against them, \nbut there are many factors affecting and limiting the design that are not requirements \nor contained in a speci fi cation: they are the constraints   . \n\n This chapter will study how constraints in fl uence the design of space systems. This \nchapter starts by analyzing the politics and the policy around space projects. It then \ncontinues by analyzing space projects according to type, size, and acceptable level of \nrisk. The chapter continues with analysis of cost, risk, and scheduling. The chapter ends \nwith a discussion on management trends and their impact on design. This chapter is not \nonly about engineering procedures and management policy but also about politics. \n\n    4.1.   Requirements versus constraints \n\n This text will divide the factors in fl uencing the material and programmatic design of \na space system into two types: requirements and constraints:\n\n   Requirement   : anything that is included in a formal speci fi cation and that will be \u2022 \nveri fi ed during the implementation process. It is internal to the project, explicit, \nand, during the architectural design phases of a project, can be negotiated and \nperhaps modi fi ed. The consumer    is normally the source of requirements.  \n  Constraint   : anything that limits or affects the system design or implementation. It \u2022 \ncan be implicit or explicit and can be external to the project. Frequently a con-\nstraint    cannot be modi fi ed or negotiated. The sponsor    is normally the source of \nconstraints.    \n\n Constraints could include such things as the need for the project to be dedicated to a \nspeci fi c purpose, being below a given cost, completed within a given timeframe, or being \nlaunched using a speci fi c launcher. Political, \u201chidden\u201d constraints can also strongly drive \nthe design. Examples of this could include a political desire for national prestige or for \ninternational cooperation that would favor, or even force speci fi c mission design fea-\ntures or suppliers. Going back to the recurrent theme of correct design by balancing \n\n    Chapter 4   \n\n Constraints and Design       \n\n\n\n66 Introduction to Space Systems\n\ncon fl icting interests, during the design process   ,  constraints will push against require-\nments until a balance is reached. In the original proposal of the Hubble    Space Telescope \nthe diameter for the mirror was 3 m. Under pressure by the sponsor    to reduce costs, the \ncustomer    proposed to reduce it to 1.8 m, which would have made the telescope    compat-\nible with well-mastered manufacturing processes. The consumer    objected strongly, argu-\ning that an optical device that small would not represent an improvement over already \noperating ground-based telescopes. The  fi nal diameter of the Hubble telescope was 2.4 \nm, which was the compromise between all the con fl icting needs. 1   \n\n    4.2.   The external environment of a space project \n\n Any space project sits inside a larger environment. From a thermodynamic point of view, \nspace design is an open process that interacts with its social, political, technical, and \neconomic environment    and that can adjust its behavior and goals as an answer to these \nexternal in fl uences. The requirements as established by the consumer    generate an inter-\nnal control loop strategy for the designer trying to ful fi ll the mission aims. Nevertheless, \nthere is actually a second, external 2  feedback driven by the constraints. The internal loop \nsets the objectives and monitors progress toward them through internal interfaces. The \nexternal loop adjusts the mission goals based on external feedback    (Figure  4.1 ).  \n\n The reaction of the external environment could force the designer to change the \nobjectives set by the mission requirements   . This double loop image is in line with the \nanalysis done in Section   1.2    , which considers the space architectural de fi nition process \nas an interaction between consumers   , sponsor   , customer,    and supplier   . The constraints \nforced by the external environment -- cost, schedule, risk, and political pressure \u2013 will \nforce this readjustment of requirements and design during the architectural de fi nition \nphase. The case of the Hubble    telescope    above is a good example of this. \n\n    4.2.1.   STEP analysis \n\n One classical approach for analyzing the external environment of any endeavor is the \nSTEP analysi   s. 3  This analysis studies the social, technical, economic, and political \nenvironment    around the endeavor.

Social environment    \n The changing social perception of a national space program will in fl uence which \nspace system could or could not become a reality. This social perception can change \nin different directions 4  for the different  fi elds of space research: it could improve or \ndegrade for Earth    observation with respect to astronomy or manned versus robotic \nresearch. In the beginning of the space age, social appreciation for space research was \nvery high. This high appreciation was tolerant of failures; six Ranger  fl ights to the \nMoon    failed before the seventh was successful. The general perception is that this \npositive attitude does not presently exist. On the other hand, the social support of \nspace research has been high and rather constant since the beginning of the space age. \nThis positive perception has been reinforced by the role of Earth observation as a \npowerful tool for weather prediction and environmental protection.  \n\n    4.2.1.2.   Technical environment \n Space design is fundamentally a technical activity and the technical environment    can-\nnot be considered \u201cexternal.\u201d During the design phases, technology readiness analy-\nsis    will characterize the problem and risk mitigation    approaches, and speci fi c \ntechnical developments will be recommended to reduce the technical risk   . This is the \nclassical risk analysis    of all space design and will be studied in Section  4.9 .  \n\n    4.2.1.3.   Economic environment \n Public or private, the feasibility and optimal design for a space system will depend \non the economic environment   . Most space endeavors are government funded; the \nstatus of public  fi nances, which depends on the economic environment, will discour-\nage or encourage the implementation of more or less ambitious space projects. ESA\u2019s \nbudget has had a long history of peaks and valleys, driven by the economic environ-\nment. The general economic mood will also in fl uence the implementation of private \nspace projects. The positive economic environment and the economic optimism of \nthe mid-1990s made possible the implementation of ambitious private telecommuni-\ncation programs like Iridium    and GlobalStar.  \n\n    4.2.1.4.   Political environment \n The overwhelming majority of space projects are done with government money. It is \na legitimate concern for political representatives to care about the use of public funds. \nThis makes the approval and implementation of any space project a political process \nthat will be subjected to changes forced by the political environment   . NASA\u2019s \nMission to Planet Earth   \u2019s  fi nancial envelope dropped from $17 billion to $8 billion in \n1992. This dramatic reduction coincided with a positive attitude toward the study of \nthe Earth as demonstrated by NASA\u2019s decision, that same year, to create two co-equal \nof fi ces within the agency: one for planetary science and astrophysics and the other for \nEarth observation   . This is a clear illustration    of the permanent tension between the \n\n   4   Evolving Public Perceptions of Space fl ight in American Culture, R. Launius, NASA, Acta Astronautica \n53, Pergamon Elsevier 2003.  \n\n\n\n68 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nunlimited desires of the consumer    and the limited resources of the sponsor   , which will \nforce mutual adjustment between requirements, constraints and the design answering \nboth of them. The package deal that created ESA in 1973, 5  included the authorization \nto start three projects: Ariane   , Spacelab, and Marots. Each one of these projects was \nsponsored by a major European nation and it was a fundamentally political decision. \nFigure  4.2  provides the funding oscillations experienced by the US space budget. \nNASA and the Department of Defense (DOD) dominate the expenditure and there is \na continuously increasing DOD percentage of participation.  \n\n In the USA, the yearly budgetary process through Congress makes the political \nenvironment    relevant during all the phases of the mission implementation. In Europe, \nwhere multiyear funding is the norm, the political environment is most important \nduring the process of approval of the project.   \n\n    4.2.2.   Forecasting and scenario analysis \n\n This text identi fi es two types of forecasting:\n\n   Short- to medium-term, limited scope forecasting  \u2022 \n  Wide-scope strategic forecasting       \u2022 \n\n Limited scope forecasting deals with the evolution of speci fi c areas, which are \nprincipally in the technical and scienti fi c domains. This limited scope provides fore-\ncasting with a high level of predictability. These predictions will be based on on-going \nand foreseen technical research on the speci fi c  fi elds under consideration. They will \nbe used for the de fi nition of the mission risk and for the establishment of develop-\nment activities needed for the mission implementation. This type of forecasting is \ncompulsory during the de fi nition phases of any space project, and the data package \nsupporting the decision on full project implementation always includes them. \n\n45,000\n\n40,000\n\n35,000\n\n30,000\n\n25,000\n\n20,000\n\n15,000\n\n10,000\n\n5,000\n\n0 1959\n\n1964\n\n1969\n\n1974\n\n1979\n\n1984\n\n1989\n\n1994\n\n1999\n\n2004\n\nNASA Space DOD DOC DOENSFOther\n\n  Figure 4.2.

This type of forecasting is done to support large space \nprojects and long-lasting space programs, but is not normally performed for average \nsingle-satellite space projects. \n\n Long-term wide- fi eld forecasting has been demonstrated to be very dif fi cult: in \n1995, the Teal group predicted that by 2005 we would have launched 1,000 commu-\nnication satellites.    6  This prediction, done by competent people with adequate \nresources, did not become a reality. Past predictions about the rapid development of \nspace industrialization or commercial Earth    observation    have also failed. Nevertheless, \nstrategic forecasting    is necessary to provide the overall framework for any large size \nor multiactor space endeavor, for example, the evolution of operational Earth obser-\nvation as a whole. Taking into account past experience, the forecasting should always \nbe done with caution and a large dosage of modesty. \n\n Scenario analysis    7  is the process of analyzing possible future events by consider-\ning alternative possible environmental developments and process outcomes: the vary-\ning scenarios. The analysis is designed to provide improved decision making by \nallowing more complete consideration of environmental evolution, process outcomes, \nand their implications. Scenarios do not try to forecast the future but to establish the \nimpact of alternative futures. This will provide a more thorough understanding, \nallowing the establishment of robust strategies that minimize risk whatever the future \nevolution. As in the case of strategic forecasting   , scenario analysis is also especially \nuseful when designing large or complex systems or systems of systems.   \n\n    4.3.   History of selected past space endeavors \n\n Political evolution has always had a strong impact in space design. Three examples \nwill be provided in the following two sections. \n\n    4.3.1.   Private versus public communications and Earth    observation \n\n Private space communication endeavors have existed from the beginning of the space \nage. Hughes had private designs for communication satellites    in GEO    as early as \n1959. Telstar was a successful private venture of AT&T already in 1962 but the politi-\ncal mood of the time discouraged private space projects and the American Congress \ncreated the monopoly Comsat just 1 month after Telstar was launched. Nevertheless, \nthis situation of national monopoly did not last long; by 1974, Comsat\u2019s monopoly \nwas broken by the U.S. Federal Communication Commission, and cable operators \nentered the market. Hughes\u2019 private design, HS-376, in Ku-band appeared after-\nwards, and this led to the development of private satellite communications in the \nUSA. In the international  fi eld the monopoly of Intelsat lasted much longer. Intelsat \n\n   6   Aviation Week and Space Technology, Mc-Graw Hill, 16 January 1995.  \n   7   The Challenge of the External Environment, U.K. Open University 1992.  \n\n\n\n70 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nwas created in 1964 and was not privatized until 2001. Nevertheless, PanAmSat had \nsuccessfully broken the monopoly of Intelsat by the mid-1980s. In Europe, which has \nalways been more public-property-oriented than the USA, Eutelsat was created in \n1983 and remained as an intergovernmental organization until its privatization in \n2001, but the  fi rst private European satellite communication operator was SES, later \nSES-Astra, created in 1985 and which is still in business. During certain periods, the \npolitical mood has favored public space communication, but whenever privatization \nwas allowed, private industry was able to provide successful space satellite commu-\nnication programs. \n\n At the beginning of the space age, the capability to observe the Earth    was exclu-\nsively in the hands of the military sector. In 1965, the American Department of the \nInterior planned to develop a satellite for civilian mapping and geology but the pro-\ngram was not approved. Finally, NASA launched the Earth Resource Technology \nSatellite ERTS-1 in 1972. This satellite, which was later called Landsat    1, became the \n fi rst Earth observation civil satellite. This started an era of public and open provision-\ning of satellite data for Earth observation. In 1979, the Carter administration declared \nthe program \u201cOperational\u201d and shifted responsibility from NASA to the National \nOceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the U.S. Department of \nCommerce. In 1984, under the Reagan administration, Congress passed a law priva-\ntizing Landsat, which at the time had already launched four Landsat satellites. This \ncreated the private company EOSAT. EOSAT, to recover its investment, increased its \nprices. This generated a 77 % reduction in the use of Landsat data from 1984 to 1990. \nThe business generated was unable to keep Landsat viable. Furthermore, the public \nSpot   -1 satellite was launched in 1986 and undermined Landsat\u2019s market. In 1992, \nLandsat was taken over by the government but a procedure for licensing of private \nEarth observation data was established. This has generated a moderately successful \ncommercial Earth observation sector, mainly in the area of high resolution    imaging, \nbut the provision of global images is still solidly in the hands of the government in \nthe USA as well as the rest of the world. In contrast to commercial satellite commu-\nnication, and despite strong political support, the development of private Earth obser-\nvation has been slow and patchy. 8   \n\n    4.3.2.   Apollo \n\n By 1960, 9  NASA\u2019s long-term plans called for a manned circumlunar  fl ight by 1970. \nThis decision was motivated by political considerations. The failed invasion of the \nBay of Pigs in Cuba had taken place the month before, and the Soviet Union had \nlaunched Yuri Gagarin into orbit just a few days before the Bay of Pigs debacle. \nPolitical leaders were asking USA to \u201ccatch up\u201d with the apparent space technology \ngap. President Kennedy chose a lunar landing. With this decision Kennedy spurred \nNASA\u2019s subsequent growth during the next few years. \n\n   8     Mixed Signals, a History of the Landsat    Program and U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Industry, \nMichael Belligan, Michigan State University 2005.  \n   9   Can Democracies Fly in Space, W. D. Kay, Praeger 1995.  \n\n\n\n71Constraints and Design\n\n At the time, three possible means of sending astronauts to the Moon    were under \n discussion: direct ascent, rendezvous    in low Earth    orbit, and the rendezvous in lunar \norbit. The short timeframe established by Kennedy favored the simpler Moon rendez-\nvous. The direct ascent would have needed a launcher much larger than the Saturn V. \nThis launcher, called Nova, was on the drawing board at NASA Marshall Space fl ight \nCenter. The low Earth orbit    rendezvous would have required several Saturn launches to \nassemble near the Earth orbit the components necessary to land on and return from the \nMoon. The lunar rendezvous was the only alternative that promised to land on the Moon \nby 1970 as Kennedy wished, and which required just a single Saturn V per  fl ight. On the \nother hand, the selected mission architecture was highly specialized and did not allow \nthe development of a range of general-purpose elements as the low Earth orbit rendez-\nvous would have allowed. During the early 1960s, the increasing budgetary support was \nmaintained even when confronted with a large series of technical failures: NASA had to \nwait until 1965 to have a \u201creasonable\u201d success rate larger than 90 %, but in the politically \nfavorable environment of the early 1960s the budget of NASA went from $462 million \nin 1960 to $5,016 million in 1964. Nevertheless, the budget remained  fl at from 1965 \nonwards and already began experiencing declines by 1968. At the time it had to  fi ght \nfor funds with the Vietnam War and with the \u201cGreat Society\u201d social program of \nL. B. Johnson. Once the lunar landing had demonstrated the superiority of Capitalism \nover Communism, which was the real aim of the sponsor   , the top-level political support \nstopped and NASA had to learn to survive with  fl at or decreasing budgets   .   \n\n    4.4.   The programmatic framework as constraint \n\n Very often, space systems being designed are located within a larger-sized program-\nmatic framework   ; they are part of a space program. This space program would have \nbeen created with a speci fi c objective and it would have established speci fi c con-\nstraints on the projects that are part of the program. ESA\u2019s Core Earth    Explorers \nProgramme 10  rules establish that the missions proposed for implementation shall \naddress broad Earth observation scienti fi c problems, that they will be selected after \npeer review, and that their predicted cost shall be below a speci fi c amount. NASA\u2019s \nNew Millennium 11  was created in 1995 to test advanced technology in space  fl ight. \nMissions in that program shall demonstrate advanced technologies that will enable \nspace science    missions with signi fi cant leaps in technical capabilities. Any design \nexercise for a possible new ESA Explorer or NASA New Millennium mission should \nrespect the rules of these programs. \n\n Programmatic constraints are clearly stated, known beforehand by all and, most of \nthe time, are not negotiable. These conditions provide compulsory guidelines for mis-\nsion cost, satellite size, allowable level of risk, mission objectives, mission imple-\nmentations, and many other aspects. These constraints have to be acknowledged and \nrespected by the mission designer.  \n\n   10   The New Candidates for ESA Earth Explorers Core Missions, A.

Types of projects by project aims \n\n Taking into account the fundamental aim of the project, space projects can be divided \ninto four classes:\n\n   Capabilities demonstration mission     \u2022 \n  Technical demonstration mission     \u2022 \n  Advancement of sciences mission     \u2022 \n  Operational mission       \u2022 \n\n Each one of them has different key mission drivers and is driven by different mis-\nsion protagonists. \n\n    4.5.1.   Capabilities demonstration \n\n These are missions where the overriding need is to demonstrate that the organization \nleading the mission has the capability to implement it successfully. The motivation is \nfundamentally political and is driven by the sponsor   . The Apollo project, the race to \nthe Moon   , was fundamentally of this nature. It was necessary to demonstrate that \nAmerica was able to put a crew on the surface of the Moon before the Soviets did. At \na most modest scale, a medium-sized country can decide to put a satellite into orbit \nas a demonstration of its technological capabilities. The most important characteristic \nof these missions is that, recalling the de fi nitions of roles outlined in Section   1.2    , they \nare not consumer    driven but sponsor driven. This situation is perfectly compatible \nwith that of the mission ful fi lling valuable scienti fi c or operational aims: Apollo pro-\nvided important information on the origin of the Earth   -Moon system but the scienti fi c \noutput is rarely important as the origin of the mission. Capability demonstration pro-\ngrams normally carry strong political support; nevertheless, they also work within \ncost limits and it is the duty of the engineer to always provide minimum cost solu-\ntions. These projects, which often carry a heavy load of national prestige, have to be \ndesigned with a very high probability of success. \n\n As a summary it can be said that these missions shall be designed so that risk of \nfailure is minimized, while cost is kept within bounds, and that high-quality scienti fi c \noutput or a long mission life    are desired and welcome but not compulsory.  \n\n    4.5.2.   Technical demonstration \n\n Technical demonstration missions    want to verify in orbit a technical development \nrelated either to a speci fi c observing technique    or to satellite platform    technology. \nThe above-mentioned, New Millennium, is a good example of this kind of mission. \nAs for capability demonstration missions, technical demonstration missions can pro-\nvide interesting mission output with outstanding scienti fi c value, but this is not their \nprimary aim. . The New Millennium mission EO-1 validated a multispectral camera, \nwhich was a signi fi cant improvement over the previous Landsat    7 ETM+ and in the \nprocess of validating the camera it produced a large number of Earth    images. To make \nthese images accessible to the interested public the \u201cEO-1 Extended Mission\u201d has \nbeen created. This Extended Mission supplements the Baseline Mission, which deals \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n73Constraints and Design\n\nwith the original aim of technology demonstration and science validation.    12  Recalling \nagain Section   1.2    , technical demonstration missions are customer    and supplier    driven \nbut the consumer    plays an important supporting role because he will be the last user \nof the information provided by the mission and of the technical advancements dem-\nonstrated. These missions allow the development of risky technology, and being just \ncapability demonstrations, the mission shall be kept within strict cost limits. To com-\npensate this double dif fi culty, these projects are failure tolerant. This is the domain \nwhere high-risk high-reward solutions can be demonstrated. As in  4.5.1 , to have a \nlong life is not a primary characteristic of this type of mission. \n\n These missions are risk tolerant, cost limited, and can have a short life but the \nmission life    and the quality of the mission products    should be enough to clearly vali-\ndate the technology under consideration.  \n\n    4.5.3.   Advancement of science \n\n The aim of an advancement of science mission is to solve a well-de fi ned scienti fi c \nproblem. To do so, it has to produce data of a speci fi ed quantity and quality. The \nabove-mentioned ESA\u2019s Earth    Explorers Program missions are examples of advance-\nment of science. Advancement of science missions is normally initiated by a group \nof scientists who propose the mission and establish its objectives; that is, they are \nconsumer    driven. These scientists often federate themselves and act as \u201cmission own-\ners.\u201d To be able to solve the scienti fi c problems it addresses, the mission often \nrequires the use of advanced technology, which also implies a high level of technical \nrisk   . In order not to waste the heavy human investment required for the preparation \nof the project, these missions have to be designed to be successful. This explains why, \nin case of failure, the mission is often repeated: ESA\u2019s science mission Cluster    was \nlost with the explosion of the  fi rst Ariane    5, but the satellites were rebuilt, success-\nfully relaunched and the mission ended up being a total success. Advancement of \nscience missions are placed within a programmatic framework    that limits the amount \nof money available for its implementation. If ful fi lling the desires of the consumer is \nincompatible with the sponsor   \u2019s ability to pay the mission will not  fl y. Advancement \nof science is the typical mission where it is necessary to balance con fl icting desires \nin order to come up with a design whose risk, performance, and price are acceptable \nto all the actors. In the past, the provision of the instruments and the processing of the \ndata produced by the mission were separate from the satellite design, and were in the \nhands of the mission owners or \u201cPrincipal Investigator   s\u201d that originally proposed the \nmission. They provided the instruments, processed the data, and published the dis-\ncoveries made possible by the mission. Today, there is a clear trend to design the \ninstruments and the ground processing and distribution of the data as just another \nelement of the space mission. \n\n Advancement of science missions requires pushing state-of-the-art technology   , but \nto ensure mission success within the allocated cost envelope, this push should be kept \nwithin bounds. In cases where the technical advancements required for the mission \n\n   12     http://eo1.gsfc.nasa.gov/      \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://eo1.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n\n\n74 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nare too high, it would be advisable to start with a precursor technical demonstration \nmission, moving to the full- fl edged advancement of science mission    only after the \nsuccessful in-orbit demonstration of the precursor. Mission life should be long \nenough to allow solving the problem under consideration. Missions with a longer life \nthan that speci fi ed may be accepted as a bonus but very long life would not normally \nbe a key mission driver. These missions must be designed to be successful and use \nadvanced technology, but they are cost limited. They need to ful fi ll the speci fi ed data \nquality and mission life   .  \n\n    4.5.4.   Operational \n\n Operational missions    answer speci fi c \u201cpermanent\u201d societal needs of clear desirability. \nThese needs are extremely varied: communications, weather prediction, climatic \nchange and environmental monitoring, and military intelligence. The missions under-\nwritten by NOAA in the USA and Eumetsat in Europe are all operational missions   . \nAn example of an operational mission is Sentinel-3,    13  which will provide information \nabout the status and evolution of the oceans and land surfaces. These missions are \nalso consumer    driven. The fundamental driver for these missions is the long-term and \nreliable provision of data of consistent and acceptable quality. These missions do not \nrequire pushing state-of-the-art science, though the observational techniques neces-\nsary to deliver the data required by the consumers    might include moderately high \nlevels of new techniques that would be accompanied by an associated level of risk. \nOperational mission    data is normally distributed openly and publicly, is quality con-\ntrolled, and has speci fi c delivery delay requirements. In operational missions, the \ninstrument and data processing are integral parts of the mission and are treated with \nthe same set of rules as the other elements. In operational missions, as in science mis-\nsions, the desires of the consumer must be limited by the sponsor   \u2019s ability to pay. In \nthe case of operational missions the cost situation is made even more dif fi cult by the \nneed to design a system able to provide the data with a very high level of availability    \nand for a long, ideally inde fi nite, period of time. To ensure long-term data delivery, \noperational missions require a series of satellites and heavy investment in ground \nprocessing and distributing infrastructure. These missions have to be designed to be \nsuccessful, but could use the multiplicity of satellites to reduce the reliability require-\nments of any one of the satellites. Mission life is an important asset, both for the \noverall mission and in order to reduce the number of satellites needed. \n\n In summary, these missions should be designed to be successful, but this is com-\npatible with a moderate level of reliability in individual satellites. They use moder-\nately advanced technology and have moderately demanding requirements for data \nquality. Long individual satellite and overall mission life    is a strong requirement. \nThey are expensive and so cost minimization is of special importance to them.   \n\n   13  GMES    Sentinel 3; A Long Term Monitoring of Ocean and Land to Support Sustainable Development, \nY.

Type of projects by projects criticality \n\n As already discussed in the previous chapter, not all the projects have the same level \nof tolerance to failure and projects can be classi fi ed by their criticality. ECSS    14  has \nestablished several categories depending on the acceptability of risk   ; NASA has an \nidentical classi fi cation. 15  On the basis of the criticality level allocated to the project, \nrequirements for its management will be relaxed or tightened. NASA NPR 8705.4 16  \ndivides its missions into the following classes    (Table  4.1 ): \n\n   For class A, all practical measures to achieve mission success shall be taken and \u2022 \nthe highest quality assurance standards shall apply.  \n  For class B, stringent assurance standards shall apply but minor compromises, still \u2022 \nmaintaining a low risk to mission success, can be applied.  \n  For class C, a medium level of risk of failure may be accepted and reduced quality \u2022 \nassurance standards are permitted.  \n  For class D, a medium to high risk of failure is permitted and minimal quality \u2022 \nassurance standards are permitted.    \n\n Depending on the classi fi cation, there is a different attitude with respect to: single-\npoint failures, model philosophy   , quali fi cation and acceptance testing, electronic and \nelectronic parts, reviews, software    development, satellite telemetry    coverage, and the \nlevel of production of formal quality assurance documentation. The  fi nal level of \nproject management requirements will depend not only on the criticality of class A to \nD but also on the mission cost.  \n\n   Table 4.1.

Types of projects by project size \n\n As just discussed above, NASA recognizes that projects with the same level of criticality \nbut of different sizes would require different management requirements. The larger a \nproject is, the more numerous its interfaces and the longer the communication channels; \ntherefore, the larger a project is, the more formalized procedures for  information  fl ow it \nneeds. On the other hand, small satellites    lead naturally toward simpli fi ed implementa-\ntion approaches   . This can be the result of a formal relaxation of management require-\nments, or can be produced naturally by the small size of the team involved in the satellite \nimplementation. A small size provides short and easy  communication chains that allow \nsolving complex multidisciplinary technical problems easily, by informal discussion \nbetween experts. In large projects, multidisciplinary problem solving requires the use of \nformal procedures    that de fi ne the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders \nin the problem, and that must be followed to arrive at a solution. \n\n In many applications, a given set of requirements can be ful fi lled by several small \nsatellites    or by a single large one. A constellation of small satellites, each one car-\nrying a small narrow- fi eld-of-view camera, could provide the same performance \nas a large satellite carrying a larger, more costly camera with a wide  fi eld-of-view. \nThe implementation through a constellation of small satellites has three bene fi ts:\n\n   It allows reaping the bene fi ts of short communication chains mentioned above.  \u2022 \n  It allows a progressive, step-by-step, robust mission implementation. This allows \u2022 \nthe use of lower reliability design solutions, and a lower level of management \nrequirements, while still ensuring a high level of overall mission availability.  \n  It raises the prospect of extending the mission, if desired, at modest cost by the \u2022 \nlaunch of replacement or spare spacecraft.    \n\n On the other hand many laws of physics do not scale well with size, and there are \nmissions that need to be large. There are limits to what small missions    can provide. \nThe advantages and limitations of small missions as \u201calternatives\u201d to normal mis-\nsions will be discussed in detail in Chapter   13    . \n\n Whatever the management approach and whatever the size, all space missions are \nunique and should be designed and managed to be successful. This is especially true \nwith advancement of science missions   , as de fi ned in Section  4.5.3 , because they are \nnormally implemented using a single satellite.  \n\n    4.8.   Cost \n\n We have introduced cost engineering    in Section   2.6.5    . In the present section we will \nanalyze how to deal with cost    as a design constraint   , how cost drives the design, and \nhow to prepare a cost estimate    that is good enough to allow a well-informed decision \nfor project go-ahead. \n\n In the previous headings of this chapter we analyzed the different types of projects \nand how they have different risk and reward sensitivities. Nevertheless, the  fi rst thing \nto be said is that the obligation to \u201cdesign to cost   \u201d applies to all projects, not just \nthose projects that have a \u201cdesign to cost\u201d label. If a project is part of a program with \nabsolute cost guidelines where the cost must be below a given threshold, the design \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_13\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_2\n\n\n77Constraints and Design\n\nwill become an exercise in providing the best possible performances within the \nestablished program cost boundaries. In cases where absolute explicit cost boundaries \ndo not exist, the sponsor    will still have a range of expenditures that he is able to tolerate. \nIt is the responsibility of the designer to know this range and to accommodate the design \nto be cost compliant. In general the designer will use bottom-up    \u201cparametric\u201d cost esti-\nmation    tools, as part of internal trade-off   s to arrive at the selected baseline. To provide \nthe necessary level of quality, the preferred alternative, or alternatives, shall be evalu-\nated in more detail using a more complex but more reliable bottom-up cost estimation \nmethod. It is especially important to provide a cost estimation that is comprehensive \nand where it is clear what is and what is not included. The cost of the implementation \nof a mission is not only the cost of the satellite; a proper estimation of the cost of new \nspace systems shall be comprehensive and include all the nonsatellite acquisition costs:\n\n   Customer   \u2019s internal costs     \u2022 \n  Launch service     \u2022 \n  Satellite operations     \u2022 \n  Technology predevelopment     \u2022 \n  Data utilization       \u2022 \n\n Almost all space projects are implemented through the interaction of the customer    \n(the space agency) and the supplier    (the space industry). The space supplier will provide \nthe industrial cost, but the total cost to the sponsor    will include the cost for maintenance \nof the customer team. These costs represent around 20 % of the cost of the satellite. \n\n The selection of a launcher    for a mission is done from a small set because the \nnumber of high reliability launchers is limited and because the launcher selection \nmight be further reduced by a possible constraint    to buy the launcher from a speci fi c \nsource. Nevertheless, accommodating the satellite in a smaller, cheaper launcher \nwhile still ful fi lling the system requirements is perhaps the best way to reduce overall \ncosts without reducing mission performance. Launchers    can also be shared, but to \nshare a launch will introduce supplementary programmatic rigidities or problems \nwith the possible orbit. Depending on the selection, launches can vary from 10 % to \n30 % of the cost of the satellite. \n\n Satellite operations include all the activities needed to keep the satellite in orbit \nworking according to the mission\u2019s needs. It is a long-term activity, which requires \nthe development of control hardware and software    and the services provided by \nhighly paid experts. Special activities like launch and early orbit and commissioning \nphase    need heavy teams to inspect and validate the satellite and its equipment while \nin orbit. All these costs need to be included in a comprehensive cost analysis. \nOperations costs are around 10 % of the cost of the satellite. Operations costs have \n fi xed and variable components. The  fi xed component will be an investment cost inde-\npendent of the mission duration, while the variable cost will be a function of the \nmission duration. There is an increasing tendency toward the reduction of operations \ncosts through using satellite autonomy   ; on the other hand, clever operators have been \nable to save missions that apparently were totally lost. For many missions a single \nrecovered satellite can compensate the cost associated with the maintenance of a large \nand experienced team kept on stand-by. \n\n Data utilization    includes: the costs associated with the process of converting the \ndata produced by the satellite into products of increasing levels of sophistication and \nthe cost of distributing these products to the  fi nal users. This cost entry is especially \n\n\n\n78 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nimportant in operational missions   . On the other hand, in the case of small science \nmissions with a \u201cprincipal investigator\u201d this cost will be hidden as an overhead of the \ninstitution doing the research with the data produced by the satellite. As in the case \nof operational costs, it has a  fi xed and a variable part. Data utilization costs can go \nfrom 5 % to 20 % of the satellite cost. The highest percentage will be for operational \nmissions, which require normally complex data distribution systems. A mission with-\nout a proper allocation for data utilization    will still be in orbit and it will demonstrate \nthe capability of the organization that put it there, but it will not provide the scienti fi c \nresults that should have been its  fi nal output. \n\n The most important element for taking into account nonsatellite costs is transpar-\nency. It must be very clear what is and what is not included, and why. Some programs \ncould include outside the allocated budget such elements as the launchers, data utili-\nzation   , the instruments, or the platform. If these are the rules of the program, the \ndesigner must follow them. Nevertheless, a correct design shall take into account the \noverall cost to the sponsor   . The existence of these off-budget costs can produce unbal-\nanced designs. A typical case is to use \u201cproject-free\u201d large launchers or large standard \nplatforms    to put small payloads into orbit that would have been compatible with \nmuch smaller and cheaper overall mission concepts. Another aspect to be taken into \naccount is that the addition of all the nonsatellite costs is quite close to that of the \nsatellite. While there is much emphasis on reducing the cost of the satellite, a propor-\ntionate effort needs to be given to reducing the cost of the nonsatellite parts of the \nsystem. This is especially clear if we consider that activities like mission operations    \nand data utilization, being ground based, appear to be far more appropriate for meet-\ning ambitious cost reduction    targets through the employment of modern approaches \nlike in-orbit autonomy   , in-orbit and on-ground arti fi cial intelligence, and advanced \ndata processing and distribution methods. On the other hand, large-scale data utiliza-\ntion subsystems for operational missions    have an unfortunate tendency to be more \ncostly and be delayed with respect to the corresponding space segment: for example, \nNASA\u2019s Mission to Planet Earth    data distribution system, Envisat\u2019s ground segment    \nof ESA, or the MetOp    ground segment of Eumetsat. It might be the case that to design \na good ground data distribution network is much more dif fi cult than the space \ndesigner assumes. The early involvement of experts in satellite operations    and in data \nprocessing and distribution subsystems is compulsory to provide a reasonable estima-\ntion of the overall cost of a space project. \n\n    4.8.1.   Top-down cost estimation \n\n The top-down    cost estimation    approach provides the cost of a satellite, which is nor-\nmally the largest cost element of the overall space system, and is commonly treated \nas a function of the satellite\u2019s dry mass    and its level of technology innovation. \n\n Top-down cost models are obtained by creating databases of the cost of earlier, \nsimilar satellites and deriving correlations between cost, mass, and innovation level. \n\n Figure  4.3  provides an example of the application of this method. The CCOSTAT \nmodel is fed with data from a number of projects. The mass and the cost are known \nnumerical data. Innovation is reduced to a numerical parameter that is a function of \nthe inheritance, or novelty, of the satellite with respect to the previous missions that \nhave been used to create the cost model database. The quality of the model will \n\n\n\n79Constraints and Design\n\ndepend of the abundance, applicability, and reliability of previous examples that are \nused for developing the procedures used to transform the elusive concept of innova-\ntion into a set of clear and unambiguous numerical values for the new satellite into \nconsideration. The reliability of this type of estimation depends upon the previous \nknowledge used in the creation of the models and of the availability of a large data-\nbase of past satellites with similar characteristics to the new satellite under consider-\nation. The term \u201csimilar characteristics\u201d implies: \n\n   Similar technical requirements and their dif fi culty  \u2022 \n  Similar project organization  \u2022 \n  Similar risk management    (Section  \u2022 4.9.1 )  \n  Similar technology development approaches (Section  \u2022 4.9.3 )  \n  Similar model philosophy (Section  \u2022 4.9.4 )  \n  And similar schedule targets (Section  \u2022 4.10 )    \n\n The creation of high-quality databases and top-down    cost estimation    models is a \ncomplex and expensive undertaking, and private companies are reluctant to reveal the \nmodels they use to make estimates. Public institutions are more open and a list of cost \nmodels used by NASA 17  can be found but as of August 2009 no public information \nwas available on top-down cost models used by ESA. Instruments constitute the \nnovel element of all missions, and there are many classes of instruments    with widely \ndifferent levels of complexity, making the cost estimations of instruments an espe-\ncially dif fi cult task. NASA employs a cost estimation    model based on Principal \nComponent Analysis. The idea behind this type of analysis is to identify the instru-\nment\u2019s most important set of independent parameters. Principal Component Analysis \nis used in many scienti fi c areas, from human genetic history to vibrations   , where it is \nessential to identify the main factors behind a system\u2019s complex behavior.

The formula above would have predicted a cost    of $332 million at 2004 dollar \nvalues. In reality the cost came to 240 million Euros at 2001 values. Adjusting for \nin fl ation between 2001 and 2004 and using the average 2004 Euro to dollar exchange \nrate of 1.25, the price of ASAR predicted by the formula was accurate to just a 4 % \nerror. This is a remarkable example of top-down cost estimation   \u2019s power to provide \nreasonable estimates of complex space items. \n\n Wertz and Larson dedicate an entire chapter of their book on space mission analy-\nsis and design 18  to cost modeling, and they provide a selection of top-down    cost \nestimations that can be used to derive preliminary cost estimations. The book also \nincludes cost estimation    algorithms for the estimation of \u201ctransversal\u201d tasks such as \nground segment    or assembly integration veri fi cation and testing. \n\n Top-down cost estimations can be used with a reasonable level of con fi dence \nespecially when used to ascertain relative comparisons of cost estimates among a \nmission\u2019s distinct design alternatives. Top-down cost estimations permit comparisons \nsuch as that depicted in Figure   3.4     of the previous chapter to be performed. Figure   3.4     \nindicated the link between a mission\u2019s utility and its cost. The existence of numerical \nmission effectiveness  fi gures    and mission cost estimates enables the proper trade-off    \nof mission implementations, which in turn allows for the convergence between the \ncon fl icting drivers of cost containment and performance excellence.  \n\n    4.8.2.   Bottom-up cost estimation \n\n Bottom-up cost estimation    proceeds by dividing all the work to be done in the \nde fi nition, implementation, and operation of a space system into packages and esti-\nmating the price of each one of them. The  fi ner the division of the work, the larger \nthe number of work packages and the more comprehensive the  fi nal cost estimation   . \nThe estimation of each one of the packages is done by consultation with the help of \nexperts with experience in the cost of similar packages done in the past. The following \nprocedures can be used:\n\n   Analogy to similar equipment/subsystem   /system-level costs, taking into account \u2022 \nthe amount of new development required  \n  System activities estimated and validated by expert-opinion  \u2022 \n  Expert judgment from technical specialists in combination with cost references, in \u2022 \ncase the amount of new development is extensive  \n  Expert judgment from technical specialists only, if references are not available    \u2022 \n\n   18   Space Mission Analysis and Design Space, Wertz and Larson, Kluwer.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\n\n\n81Constraints and Design\n\n It is also possible to supplement a bottom-up    cost estimation    with some top-down    \nparametric values; for example:\n\n   Parametric cost models for equipment and subsystems with a low level of \u2022 \ninnovation  \n  System-level parametric cost models, based on observed trends for relevant \u2022 \nreferences    \n\n The  fi nal cost is the addition of all the individual costs. To create a detailed bottom-\nup    cost estimation    requires a large amount of effort and it cannot be repeated many \ntimes during the process of de fi nition of a space mission. It is also evident that to be \nable to provide a high-quality prediction of the cost of the mission it is necessary to \nhave a fairly detailed level of design, including a rather detailed approach to the devel-\nopment and to the test philosophy; test is one of the main cost drivers   . Detailed bot-\ntom-up cost estimations are normally produced by the supplier    and delivered to the \ncustomer    when the de fi nition phases of the possible new mission are  fi nished. The \nbottom-up cost estimation will be discussed between the supplier and the customer and \nwill be  fi nally provided to the sponsor    to provide credibility to the cost estimations. \n\n Bottom-up cost estimations are management documents and used mainly for man-\nagement purposes. When the supplier    provides it, he commits himself not only for an \noverall cost but also for a detailed decomposition. For this reason, the supplier will \ndeliver the cost estimation    only when reasonably sure of the credibility of the \nestimation.  \n\n    4.8.3.   The risk of cost estimations \n\n Cost estimations \u2013 either top-down    or bottom-up    \u2013 carry a risk of being wrong. It will \nbe possible to quantify this risk by de fi ning the cost estimation    not as a single value \nbut as a probability distribution with its mean and its variance   . There are methods that \nestimate that probability distribution and it would be possible to determine cost esti-\nmations that would ensure a given level of con fi dence that the  fi nal cost will not \nexceed the determined cost. The probability distribution will depend on:\n\n   The innovation of the mission under consideration. This takes into account the cost \u2022 \ngrowth caused by unseen complexities that will be revealed as the design matures \ninto more details.  \n  The accuracy and quality of the parametric cost models themselves that depend \u2022 \nnot only on their intrinsic quality but also on the applicability of the model to the \nspeci fi c context of the new cost estimate.  \n  Project management decisions to account for cost risks induced by potentially \u2022 \nnegative events, as well as potentially positive opportunities, that may occur or not \nand that are under the direct responsibility of the project manager   .  \n  External events to account for cost risks or opportunities that originate from exter-\u2022 \nnal in fl uences outside the direct control and responsibility of the project manager.    \n\n It is possible to combine all the factors above by mathematical procedures \u2013 for \nexample, Monte Carlo simulation \u2013 and derive a  fi nal total probabilistic    project cost. \nIt is necessary to determine the percentage of probability that is going to determine \nthe level of  fi nancial reserves that the space project will use to deal with unexpected \n\n\n\n82 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nevents during the project\u2019s implementation. The value corresponding to 70 % \ncon fi dence level is often used to determine the cost reserve for the project.  \n\n    4.8.4.   Single satellite versus multiple satellites cost \n\n Most of the time satellites are single units with a reasonably high level of novelty. \nEven in many cases where the new satellite uses standard components, they are com-\nbined in new ways; the new satellite is always a new design. This will imply that the \ncost of a second \u2013 recurrent \u2013 model will be much cheaper than for the design, manu-\nfacturing, and assembly of the  fi rst model. A good rule of thumb is that the  fi rst recur-\nrent unit of something very new can be 0.5 times the  fi rst \u201cprototype\u201d unit. A second \nfactor is that the building of subsequent units becomes cheaper as the number of units \nincreases. This is called the learning factor. There are rules based on previous experi-\nence with series production that provide guidelines for the estimation of the cost of a \nseries of identical satellites.   \n\n    4.9.   Risk constraints \n\n The term risk    denotes the degree of variability in the outcome or result of a particular \naction. The risk management    focus should be in the avoidance of undesired outcomes \nsuch as technical failures or cost    overruns. In this section we are going to study how \nrisk management in conjunction with mission aims drive the physical and program-\nmatic design. In the context of space projects, risk has two dimensions: the likelihood \nof the outcome and the severity of the outcome. It is not an accident that we speak of \nrisk management and not of risk engineering. To accept or not to accept a given level \nof risk is  fi nally a management decision, and the most that can be requested from \nengineers is to document the case as thoroughly and in as unbiased a manner as pos-\nsible, so that the manager can take the  fi nal decision. The present book focuses on the \ndesign work previous to a formal decision on project go-ahead, before a project man-\nager    was appointed. In these mission architecture de fi nition phases, the architect    shall \nprovide the sponsor    with a fair depiction of the risks of the mission and the develop-\nmental approach chosen to minimize them. With this information, the sponsor will \napprove or reject the mission. \n\n    4.9.1.   Qualitative risk management    \n\n Space projects are risky: space deals with a low number of satellites \u2013 most of the \ntime a single satellite \u2013 and the  fi rst time something is veri fi ed in the real situation is \nin space where there are few opportunities for software    changes and almost no oppor-\ntunity for hardware changes. The management of risks includes:\n\n   The systematic identi fi cation, evaluation, and classi fi cation of all risks causes and \u2022 \nconsequences  \n  The systematic de fi nition, implementation, control, and veri fi cation of actions \u2022 \nappropriate for the elimination of risks or their reduction to an acceptable level    \n\n\n\n83Constraints and Design\n\n Due consideration of risk    is necessary from the earliest stages of mission design, \nand it is necessary to provide a comprehensive and unbiased estimation of mission \nrisk to allow a well-informed project approval or cancelation. Risk management, \nalbeit having a strong science/techniques component, is a management activity, and \nmanagers are responsible for managing the risks and for their planning and imple-\nmentation, in a cost-effective way. The project manager    must make appropriate \narrangements to prevent those risks from arising, to prevent their consequences from \nmaterializing, and to ensure the necessary reporting to allow appropriate overall \nsupervision. The estimation of risk is based on the assessment of all risk from the \npoint of view of: likelihood of an event occurrence and severity of the consequences \nof the event occurring. The severity of consequence is divided into:\n\n   High, if the event would impede the achievement of the commitments formally \u2022 \nmade with respect to the consumer    or sponsor    for a program or project  \n  Medium, when the event would affect the achievement of the committed perfor-\u2022 \nmance or planned schedule    or costs, typically taking months to restore the situa-\ntion or requiring funding beyond plans within the approved margins  \n  Low, when the event would, at the most, affect the planned distribution of perfor-\u2022 \nmance, schedule, or cost, typically taking a few weeks to restore the situation and \npossibly requiring redeployment of project resources    \n\n The likelihood of occurrence is divided into:\n\n   High, when the event is very likely to occur, and plans or controls are not available \u2022 \nor cannot be put in place to prevent the risk or the consequences from \nmaterializing  \n  Medium, when the event is likely to occur, or current plans or controls are not \u2022 \nexpected to prevent the risk or the consequences from materializing, and substan-\ntial additional actions would be required  \n  Low, when the event could occur, but is not likely to, or current plans or controls \u2022 \nare expected to be suf fi cient to prevent this type of event or its consequences from \nmaterializing    \n\n Following the rules of composition between likelihood and severity used in \nTable  4.2 , it is possible to directly classify each risk as: critical (dark gray), major \n(middle gray), and signi fi cant (light gray   ).  \n\n   Table 4.2.    Level of Risk Criticality.       \n\nLikelihood\nof\noccurrence\n\nHigh Major Critical Critical\n\nSignificant Significant Major Critical\n\nLow Significant Significant Major\n\nLow Medium High\n\nSeverity of Consequence\n\n\n\n84 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n Risks have to be characterized, analyzed, and mitigated and the status of the risk \nshall be tracked throughout the project. Experts in the different  fi elds will identify the \nrisks associated with the different  fi elds. These technical risks will be associated with \nthe novelty and the dif fi culty of the system under consideration and that is dependent \non the ambition of the targets sought by the consumers   . Once identi fi ed the risks are \nlisted and documented following formal procedures.    \n\n The management of risk is a specialized domain but the responsibility of risk \nmanagement    is in the hands of the project manager. Before the beginning of the proj-\nect a responsibility of the architect    is to be aware of the risks of the mission, mainly \nof the risks associated with the level of technical maturity of the technologies consid-\nered for the mission. Technology maturity levels and technology development will be \ncovered in detail in Section  4.9.3 .\n\n   The management of the risks shall be in accordance with the rating of the risk, \u2022 \nnamely: critical, major, or signi fi cant.  \n  Signi fi cant risks are resolved through risk avoidance or risk reduction and control \u2022 \nactions. Typical risk avoidance is via design change. Typical risk reduction and \ncontrol could include: detection by analysis, direct monitoring or inspection, and \nearly application of preplanned responses to limit the extent of the consequences. \nIn some cases, for example, excessive cost of risk-reduction measures, the \nsigni fi cant persons in charge \u2013 the project or program manager \u2013 may accept \nsigni fi cant risks.  \n  Major risk shall be resolved primarily through risk avoidance actions or by risk \u2022 \ntransfer. There may be actions to modify baseline con fi gurations, plans or costs, or \nto set-up alternative operating ways and means. Acceptance of major risks shall \nnormally be avoided unless they are unavoidable and in that case they must be \nagreement at high management level.  \n  Critical risks shall be resolved primarily through risk avoidance or by risk transfer. \u2022 \nPotential avoidance measures may involve substantial redeployment of resources \nand organization or renegotiating agreements or requesting exceptions with exter-\nnal parties, for example, with the consumer   , sponsor,    or supplier   , or by modifying \ncommitments, including their funding. Acceptance of critical risks shall be \navoided unless they are unavoidable and then agreement at the highest manage-\nment level is essential.    \n\n A risk can be accepted if it is considered to be suf fi ciently low in terms of its likeli-\nhood of occurrence and the severity of its consequences. To limit the severity of the \nconsequences of the risk protective actions are taken, for example, shielding to pro-\ntect against radiation damage or dampening for high levels of vibration. The likeli-\nhood can be reduced through preventive actions, for example, undertaking a \npredevelopment activity or adding redundancy. \n\n Risk management can be applied at all phases of a project and at all levels. Note \nthat risk management is an end-to-end process, and not only for the satellite, since if \nthe ground segment    of a space system does not work then nothing works. Envisat and \nMetOp    and MSG    are examples where managing risks with the ground segment \nimplementation proved to be an important activity. Therefore, ground segment risks \nare to be treated as seriously as space segment risks, especially for an operational \nsystem. Note that the principal aim of a space system is not to demonstrate that we \n\n\n\n85Constraints and Design\n\ncan  fl y a satellite, but to produce a speci fi c information stream and this needs ground \nprocessing. \n\n Some risk analysis is done without a formal risk management    framework, which \noften implies that a large project team already exists, for example, the phase A satel-\nlite development plan is not a formal risk management document but a document to \nmanage risk. \n\n Risk shall be identi fi ed, characterized, and mitigated. The risks are identi fi ed and \ncharacterized by the experts in the different technical  fi elds where the risks lay. Once \nthey are identi fi ed, they are recorded and formally characterized in tables and tem-\nplates, assigning to each one the appropriate class of risk   . The mitigation of risk is \napplied throughout the project. Milestones and external reviews mitigate risk, and so \ndoes technical development both prior to, within, or parallel to, the project schedule. \nRisk is also mitigated by the use of contingency management reserves on cost or \nschedule. Formal techniques include the establishment of critical items and issues list \nplus all the traditional cost and schedule control systems.  \n\n    4.9.2.   Quantitative risk management \n\n Numerical probabilistic    risk analysis    can characterize risk. The full most comprehen-\nsive analysis of this type will include modeling a comprehensive set of scenarios \nleading to all undesired end states including loss of crew \u2013 if applicable \u2013 or danger \nfor the public. In this most comprehensive approach all the basic causes are modeled, \nincluding: hardware failures, human errors, process errors, and others. A simpler \napproach focuses in a limited set of events, most of the times in mission failure and \nanalyzes only speci fi c types of failure mechanisms    \u2013 like probabilistic failure analysis \nof parts \u2013 that are specially adequate for numerical treatment. This is the well-estab-\nlished branch of availability    and reliability calculations. Mission speci fi cations estab-\nlish the availability of the service provided by the space mission. Satellite \nspeci fi cations establish the probability of a satellite to be still operating correctly after \na number of years. Product assurance    specialists (Section   2.6.2    ) perform this branch \nof quantitative risk management   . \n\n The present section will concentrate in numerical techniques different from avail-\nability    and reliability. There are techniques such as probabilistic    risk analysis, proba-\nbilistic network schedules, or Monte Carlo models that are able to provide probabilistic \nassessment of the risk involved in the estimation of parameters like: performance, \ncost, or schedule. At NASA this type of comprehensive probabilistic risk assessments    \n(PRA) are conducted for new programs in situations of high criticality. 19  These situ-\nations include:\n\n   Human space  fl ight.  \u2022 \n  Special issues of public safety \u2013 for instance when  fl ying nuclear payload as done \u2022 \nin Ulysses    (Section   9.6.2    ).  \n  High visibility programs with high schedule criticality. This would be the case for \u2022 \nambitious planetary missions requiring a very speci fi c launch date.    \n\n   19   Quantitative Risk Analysis at NASA, William Vesely, NASA.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_2\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n86 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n ESA that has had consistently a much smaller emphasis in manned space does not \nperform systematic PRA different from \u201ctraditional\u201d availability    and reliability \nanalysis.

This will be studied later in Section   5.8     that will analyze tools for numerical \nsupport to decision making.  \n\n    4.9.3.   Technical readiness and technical development \n\n Technology readiness levels    are used extensively to de fi ne the level of maturity of a \ntechnology.

Technology levels TRL3 to 5 \nalready point toward developing usable implementations, but they still aim toward a \nrange of applications. TRL 5, 6, and 7 are the logical technology levels to be consid-\nered during the early stages of designing a new space mission but before the new \nproject team is fully implemented. TRL 6 to 9 are normally performed within the \nframework of an already approved mission. The conclusion is that to keep the level \nof risk    within reasonable limits, it is crucial to have performed at least the  fi rst four \nlevels to include the technology in the design of a new system, and to level 6 or higher \nfor its implementation. 21  \n\n In some cases a possible new space mission will require the development of a very \nspecial observing technique   . In this case all the developmental effort, including the \nbasic research, will be done with a  fi nal aim in mind. Nevertheless, this development \nwill still be rather \u201cdetailed mission design independent\u201d because the reachable per-\nformances for the technology could not yet be predictable and because it would be \ntoo early to foresee the physical implementation that the technology under develop-\nment would require. \n\n When a new mission is proposed it already has a preexisting body of technical \nresearch available that it can identify and use. During the de fi nition stages of the new \nmission, the status of the technology will be studied and this will allow identi fi cation \nof areas that are already well developed and areas where there are gaps. The normally \nlong time needed to de fi ne and to approve or reject a new space mission offers the \nopportunity for steering the previously existing development in a direction that is \nuseful for the new mission under consideration. The amount of money available \nbefore the project is fully approved will be moderate; but this period will allow \ndif fi cult technology to mature, wrong paths to be explored and discarded, and the best \nalternatives to be found. Often the development of technologies needs time and an \nalready approved program cannot tolerate the delays that would be introduced by \nfailure in the development of a key technology. A new space project should avoid \nproposing the use of a development that requires a new technology with a low TRL \nlevel. If this were absolutely necessary to ful fi lling consumer    requirements, these \nfactors should be clearly indicated and discussed before the project is approved. In an \nextreme case, and for very challenging technologies, it would be necessary to start \nwith a technology demonstration mission before the related advancement of a science \nmission could be undertaken. \n\n Technology readiness levels    are not static quantities that once obtained will stay \nforever. There are two factors that will reduce the status of technical maturity of a \ntechnology:\n\n   The status of a technology changes when used in a new environment. A device \u2022 \nsuccessfully     fl own in a given type of environment is TRL 9 only when  fl ying again \nin a similar environment. It will not be possible to use a technology demonstrated \nwith a short  fl ight around the Earth    and to claim that it is  fl ight quali fi ed for a \n\n   21   Technology Readiness Level Schedule Risk and Slippage in Spacecraft Design, Gregory Dubos, J Saleh, \nRobert Braun, Georgia Institute of Technology, Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets Vol 45 No 4 July\u2013\nAugust 2008.  \n\n\n\n88 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n mission to a far-away planet. It will be necessary to perform dedicated development \nto gain con fi dence on the behavior of the technology in the new environment.  \n  Know-how and technological maturity can be lost, persons can retire, or special \u2022 \nmanufacturing materials or procedures can be discontinued. This is a very real \npossibility in the space  fi eld that works normally with short series production and \nwith infrequent contracts. The problem of obsolescence is specially acute in the \narea of electronic components because the average lifespan of a electronic technol-\nogy is normally much shorter than the time necessary for the implementation and \noperation of a space mission.     \n\n    4.9.4.   Developmental approach and model philosophy \n\n Before authorizing a new space project, and to be able to provide a clear cost    and risk    \nestimation, it is essential to establish a developmental approach including:\n\n   Predevelopment    of critical technologies   , to be performed before full project imple-\u2022 \nmentation begins  \n  Developmental approach and model philosophy    to be applied during project \u2022 \nimplementation    \n\n Predevelopment    work expenditure is normally small with respect to the overall \ncost of the project, but, as mentioned above, it provides time for technology develop-\nment. The project development work will be based on the model philosophy    chosen. \nDifferent models of the satellite and its assemblies will be built. These models will \nhave objectives progressively more ambitious until the  fi nal model will be used for \n fl ight:\n\n   Development and breadboard models, which are use to understand and improve \u2022 \nthe design of the items under test.  \n  Engineering models    are used to characterize the functional behavior of the items \u2022 \nunder test. They shall be functional representatives but they do not need to be fully \nphysically representative of the  fi nal item to be  fl own.  \n  Quali fi cation models    shall be functional and physically representative of the  fl ight \u2022 \nhardware. Quali fi cation model shall be able to provide the in-orbit performances \nwhen tested in an environment fully representative of the in-orbit situation. They \nare used to formally validate \u2013 that means \u201cqualify\u201d \u2013 the adequacy of the item for \nthe intended purpose in the intended environment.  \n  Flight model   . This is the model that will actually  fl y.    \u2022 \n\n The model philosophy    will be a function of the novelty of the satellite, of the risk    \nacceptance-avoidance of the project, and of the cost    and schedule    constraints. The \nestablishment of a developmental approach and its associated model philosophy will \nprovide credibility to the cost, schedule, and risk estimations of the future space \n project, and it is fundamental for a well-informed decision on project  go-ahead to \nbe made. \n\n In the past a very deliberate approach toward engineering development with a \ncorrespondingly \u201cheavy\u201d approach to model philosophy    was the norm. Today, it is the \nexception. ESA\u2019s mission Ulysses   , which was designed in the mid-1970s, had three \nmodels: an engineering model, a quali fi cation model, and a  fl ight model; and the \n\n\n\n89Constraints and Design\n\nquali fi cation model was fully representative of the  fl ight hardware. The building of \nthese models was totally sequential, so that the lessons learned from one model were \nimplemented in the next one. This produced a long and costly implementation, but \nthe risk    was minimized. Present cost    and schedule    pressures and the evolution of \ntechnical factors, principally computers and computer-based simulations, have led to \nmuch more streamlined approaches being used. Modern analytical tools such as ther-\nmal, structural, and electromagnetic interference   , allow a very high level of con fi dence \non predicting the behavior of satellites, and \u201cvirtual models\u201d allow the use of test \ncon fi gurations which mix real physical hardware and computer-residing simulations. \nThis allows test benches that provide progressive con fi dence in the components being \ndesigned and allows minimizing the work prior to building the  fl ight model. With this \napproach the  fl ight model will be the  fi rst \u201cphysical\u201d model where all  fl ight-standard \nsatellite components will come together, and it will also be used as the \u201cformal\u201d \nquali fi cation model. This is the \u201cproto- fl ight\u201d approach where the model to be  fl own \nis at the same time its own prototype and goes through quali fi cation tests before \n fl ying. \n\n The selection of the model philosophy    is very closely related to the risk manage-\nment    process and the technology readiness status on a program. Deliberate develop-\nment approaches reduce risk but increase cost and schedule. The selection of the \ndevelopment approach    and of the resulting model philosophy will be the result of \nbalancing four con fl icting forces (Figure  4.5 ): \n\n   The programmatic constraints    (schedule, funds, \u2026) established by the sponsor     \u2022 \n  The development status and resulting technical readiness levels   , heritage, and \u2022 \nnovelty of the mission under consideration  \n\nProgrammatic constraints:\n\nSchedule\nCost\nIndustrial architecture\nReviews\nInterfaces \n\nVerification approaches:\nVerification methods\nVerification levels\nIndustrial architecture\nVerification phases \n\nTest approach:\n\nTest requirements\nTest sequence\nTest facilities \n\nDevelopment status:\n\nTechnology maturity\nHeritage\nSuppliers \n\nModel Philosophy \n\n  Figure 4.5.

As stated \nabove, the improving  fi delity of computer-based simulations provides increasing \ncon fi dence in their ef fi cacy. Furthermore, this problem also applies to testing: \nground tests of space hardware, for example, vibration, thermal, or large deployable \nfunctional testing, are nothing but \u201csimulation\u201d of the real space conditions. From \nthis perspective, both analysis and tests can both be closer or further away from the \nreal in-orbit situation. The conclusion is that the veri fi cation approach   , by testing, by \nanalysis, or by a combination of both, shall always be critically analyzed for ade-\nquate representation of the space conditions. This representational adequacy is \nespecially important because highly representative tests are sophisticated and \nsophisticated tests are expensive. To reduce the sophistication of veri fi cation, large \nmargins can be used, but large margins imply overdesigning and overdesigning is \nalso expensive. Again, the need for balance appears in our struggle to arrive at an \noptimal design. A supplementary lesson of this discussion is that sophisticated tests, \nbeing cost drivers   , should be analyzed with special care in order that a credible cost \nestimation    for a space project can be made. \n\n It is common for sophisticated testing to provide test results that require \nyet another layer of analysis and interpretation before the results can be applied \nto the  fl ight conditions. This is because in these sophisticated tests, it is not \n possible to exactly simulate the  fl ight environment. It is only possible to approx-\nimate them. \n\n The recently approved Sentinel-3    mission is an example of a modern streamlined \ndevelopmental approach (Figure  4.6 ). At satellite level, the only full \u201cphysical\u201d \nmodel that is going to be tested is the Flight Model/Proto fl ight Model    (FM/PFM), \nwhich will be used for full satellite quali fi cation as well as for  fl ying. Equipment is \ngoing to be tested in representative Engineering Models (EM) or highly representa-\ntive Engineering Quali fi cation Models (EQM). These models are used for quali fi cation \nat instrument \u2013 or subsystem    \u2013 levels. These EM/EQMs will ultimately be assembled \nin a \u201cvirtual satellite EM,\u201d which includes instruments, electronic equipment, and \nsoftware   , all assembled together. A Structural and Thermal Model    (STM) is used for \nquali fi cation of the structure and for early validation    of the analytical, mechanical, \nand thermal models used to predict the environment within the satellite. The Suitcase \nis a dedicated model to study the compatibility of the end-to-end communications \nchains.  \n\n The employment of combined software   -hardware environments will allow the \nuse of models that will evolve during the life of the project: from the early phases\u2019 \nmission performance simulators, to contributors to the quali fi cation, to operations \ntraining tools, and  fi nally to on-ground helpers in the case of in-orbit failure of \nequipment.   \n\n\n\n91Constraints and Design\n\n    4.10.   Schedule constraints \n\n Any space endeavor is a set of activities that are connected in time. The number and \ncomplication of the activities, the need to perform these activities in series or the pos-\nsibility of doing them in parallel, and the level and quality of resources available for \nthe execution of the work will directly in fl uence and contribute to the derivation of \nthe schedule    of the whole endeavor and of each of their parts. \n\n Complex projects require a series of activities, some of which must be performed \nsequentially and others that can be performed in parallel with other activities. This \nseries of sequential and parallel activities was  fi rst modeled as a network for project \nmanagement    in 1957, and is known as the Critical Path Method    (CPM). CPM uses \n fi xed time estimates for each activity in a deterministic    approach. It enables managers \nto determine how the combination of parallel and sequential activities can combine \nto de fi ne the shortest possible schedule   ; that is, the longest sequence of activities that \ncan obligatorily be executed in series. The Program Evaluation and Review Technique    \n(PERT), on the other hand, allows for randomness in the completion times of \nactivities. \n\n To determine the expected duration of any endeavor it is necessary:\n\n   To divide the whole endeavor into individual activities with a clear beginning \u2022 \nand end.  \n\nE\nqu\n\nip\nm\n\nen\nt l\n\nev\nel\n\n  \nIn\n\nst\nru\n\nm\nen\n\nt &\nsu\n\nbs\nys\n\nte\nm\n\n le\nve\n\nl \nS\n\nat\nel\n\nlit\ne \n\nle\nve\n\nl \n\nDevelopment\ntest as \n\nrequired \n\nProject advancement timeline \n\nStructural\nand thermal\nqualification \n\nSubsystem\nfunctional\n\nqualification \n\nVirtual\nelectronics\nengineering\n\nmodel \n\nSuitcasesStructural and\nthermal model\n\nEquipment\nfunctional\n\nqualification \n\nEquipment\nengineering\n\nmodel \n\nInstruments\nengineering\n\nmodel\n\nData and\nradiofrequency \n\ncompatibility \nElectronics\n\nqualification \n\nSatellite\nacceptance and\n\nqualification \n\nSubsystems\nengineering\n\nmodel\n\nInstruments\nfunctional\n\nqualification \n\nFlight model\nand proto-\n\nflight models\n\nThermal and\nmechanical\ndummies \n\nAcceptance or\nqualification\n\ntesting \n\nFlight model\nand proto-\n\nflight models\n\nFlight model\nand proto-\n\nflight models \n\nIn\ncr\n\nea\nse\n\nd \nle\n\nve\nl o\n\nf i\nnt\n\neg\nra\n\ntio\nn \n\nAcceptance or\nqualification\n\ntesting \n\n  Figure 4.6.     Model Philosophy of a Modern Earth    Observation Operational Satellite: ESA\u2019s \nSentinel-3    (Sentinel-3    Quotation Executive Summary, Thales Alenia Space, 2007).       \n\n \n\n\n\n92 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  To allocate preliminary resources to the different activities.  \u2022 \n  To determine the necessary duration of each activity in consultation with experts. \u2022 \nDurations are a function of the level of resources \u2013 human and material \u2013 available \nfor the execution of each activity. The duration  fi gures can be  fi xed or probabilistic    \npro fi les.  \n  To establish logical links of precedence between the beginning and the end of each \u2022 \nactivity; for example, the manufacturing of an item cannot start before it has been \ndesigned.  \n  To determine the longest duration \u201ccritical path\u201d sequence of activities logically \u2022 \nlinked in series and running from the beginning to the end of the endeavor. The sum \nof these activities will determine the overall program duration.  \n  To increase the assignment of resources to the activities in the \u201ccritical path\u201d \u2022 \nsequence in order to reduce the overall duration, and to look for an optimal alloca-\ntion of resources allowing the shortest duration in accordance with the allowable \nresources.  \n  To update the allocation of resources and provide  fi nal schedule estimates   .    \u2022 \n\n That means, the schedule of a project is not an independent parameter. The time \nneeded for project implementation will derive directly from the development \napproach    and model philosophy   , which will be a function of the level of novelty of \nthe design proposed and of the failure-tolerance of the project. The desire to compress \nschedules without giving due regard to model philosophy, failure-tolerance, and the \nlevel of novelty should be resisted. The model philosophy of space hardware devel-\nopment is based on learning lessons from the early models, which can be imple-\nmented in the later ones; therefore, the level of allowed overlapping between models \nis limited. The only way to answer strong schedule constraints is to design a project \nthat uses mature technologies, thereby allowing a streamlined model philosophy and \na simpli fi ed review approach. Communication satellites, which have a very low level \nof novelty and a correspondingly simpli fi ed model philosophy, can be implemented \nin 2 years or less. This is not the case with most satellites that require development \nof new technology pushing the state of the art. \n\n The architectural de fi nition phases    of all satellites will include schedule estimations \nfor the duration of the full program implementation. As stated above, the schedule will \nhave a critical path that will be provided by the need to sequentially design, build, test \nat component level, assemble, and  fi nally test at satellite level. The overall schedule \nwill include bar charts for the overall satellite and for the most important elements of \nthe mission, such as the instruments. The schedule has to be realistic and must provide \nenough time to allocate to potential failures in the test program. This schedule predic-\ntion, which should be  fi rmly based on the overall development philosophy, will \ncomplement the cost    information as fundamental data for the mission approval or \ncancelation by the sponsor   .  \n\n    4.11.   Management trends as constraints \n\n Management    trends are management fashions that can constrain the design. The con-\nstraints can come as an explicit directive, for example, to provide design features in \nthe satellite that allow in-orbit servicing by astronauts, or as an implicit mood, for \n\n\n\n93Constraints and Design\n\nexample, situations where management encourages or discourages high levels of risk   . \nExamples of trends include in-orbit servicing by astronauts, large standard platforms   , \nand small satellites   . Almost all the trends that we have seen since the beginning of \nthe space age were based on quite sound reasoning, and they were adequate in some \ncontexts. On the other hand, almost all of them were overadvertised and in real life \nthey have all demonstrated limitations. \n\n In the 1970s the USA decided to rely principally on the use of the Space Shuttle \nfor low Earth    orbit missions, which was eventually proved to be an unwise decision, \nand meant that a large number of such missions would incur the costs of using a \nman-rated system when this was unnecessary. This trend became an explicit space \nsystems design directive when in 1978 Jimmy Carter ordered the expendable launch \nvehicles to be phased out in favor of the Space Shuttle. A good example of the type \nof mission design that this directive produced was Shuttle-6, which carried and \nreleased in low Earth orbit    a 2,200 kg TDRSS   -1 satellite. This satellite used an IUS    \nupper stage to reach its intended geostationary orbit    from the Shuttle\u2019s orbit. This \napproach put many satellites successfully in orbit, but the original predictions \nregarding Shuttle turnaround times and costs proved to be far too optimistic. These \npredictions claimed that the Space Shuttle would be capable of putting payloads in \nlow Earth orbit for $400 per pound, but the actual cost was closer to $5,000\u201310,000. 22  \nThe original aim was to launch 26 shuttle  fl ights per year, but the maximum number \nhas been just six. \n\n The 1980s were the time of in-orbit servicing by astronauts, made possible by the \nuse of the Space Shuttle as the launch vehicle of choice. The Challenger crew ser-\nviced Solarmax in space in April 1984. The satellite was designed for in-orbit servic-\ning but the astronauts also performed successful unforeseen repairs on the Coronagraph \nusing duct tape and pliers. Here we have a clear example of a mission saved by in-\norbit servicing. The use of astronauts for the servicing of the Hubble    Space Telescope \nrescued the mission from failure, but the requirements of astronaut servicing entailed \nan orbit that was inadequate for an astronomy mission. This is another example of the \ncontradictory impact of trends. The different in fl uences acting on the design of the \nHubble mission design will be discussed further in Section   7.2    . \n\n The 1980s 23  were also a period of extensive use of standard platforms    as tools of \ncost reduction   . In the 1980s NASA decided to reduce the costs of deep space    missions \nby standardization in two types of buses: Mariner Mark II for outer solar system    mis-\nsions and Observers for the inner solar system. Cassini was the only successful \nMariner Mark II mission. The 2,500 kg Mars    Observer, which failed to reach Mars, \nwas the only Observer mission. On the other hand, the use of standard platforms in \nthe series of NOAA operational meteorological satellites    and later, with a different \nmodel in NASA-NOAA\u2019s Terra, Aqua, and Aura, led to cost reductions as well as \nsuccessful performances. \n\n The 1990s were the years of \u201cfaster, cheaper, better.   \u201d This trend came with a \nhigher tolerance to failure and the desire for an intense rethinking about how things \n\n   22   Restoring US Launch Capacity, Robert Zirkle, \u201cSpace National Programs and International Cooperation\u201d \nBoulder Colorado, Westview Press 1989.  \n   23   Space System Failures, Harland and Lorenz, Praxis.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n94 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nwere done and how they could be done better. This renewal helped to reinvigorate \nNASA after a string of high visibility failures in the early 1990s which included the \ndiscovery of the Hubble    aberration in 1990, the failure in the deployment of the high-\ngain Galileo    antenna in 1992, and the crisis in GOES that in 1992 was three years \nbehind schedule and over twice the planned cost. The actual implementation of the \n\u201cfaster implementation cheaper\u201d philosophy included successes, like Clementine, and \nfailures, like Mars    Climate Observer and Polar Lander. Again, the actual implementa-\ntion provided both lights and shadows. It was clear that the missions trying to be at \nthe same time fast and cheap while having ambitious objectives and being objectively \ncomplex had a very large probability of failure. 24  This topic is retaken in Section \n  13.2.3     and speci fi cally in Figure   13.1    . \n\n The current decade appears not to display any overwhelming trend, albeit small \nsatellites    and the use of nanotechnology could be considered the fashionable trends \nof recent years. Small satellites can solve many problems, but the goal should never \nbe to design a small satellite, but rather the smallest satellite that ful fi lls the mission\u2019s \nrequirements. Nanotechnology    is also quite appropriate for some applications, mainly \nfor deep space    missions, but many of the laws of physics do not scale well with size. \nIf experience of the past should be our guide for the future, the trend toward small \nmissions    shall be welcomed as a salutary measure for cost reduction   , but we should \ntreat it with a healthy dosage of skepticism: it will not be applicable in every case. \n\n All the trends above featured advantages and disadvantages and they all included \nsuccesses and failures on account of it. The problem has been more the trend\u2019s over-\npromotion, than the trend in itself. Engineering has its own form of \u201crough justice\u201d: \neither the hardware works or it does not. If it works, the design is successful; if it does \nnot the design is unsuccessful and there is no level of oratory, persuasive argumenta-\ntion or orders from headquarters that can open a jammed deployable antenna. If a \nmanagement trend becomes a management directive, the designer shall take it as just \nanother explicit system constraint    and include it in the basic design. It is also the \ndesigner\u2019s duty to point out the implications of that trend in the design, to indicate \nwhere and how it is adequate, and inform the decision maker of those implications. \nIt will ultimately be the decision maker, usually the sponsor   , who decides whether or \nnot to implement the trend.        \n\n   24   When Is a Satellite Mission Too Fast and Too Cheap?

Parallel to the synchronic perspec-\ntive, linguistics also introduced the term \u201cdiachronic\u201d    to refer to the study of how \nlanguages change with time. As in linguistics, the process of designing a space \nmission can be analyzed from either a synchronic or diachronic viewpoint. The present \nchapter will discuss typical mission designs from a synchronic perspective, while the \nfollowing one will take a diachronic approach. \n\n Analyzing the design process    from a synchronic standpoint involves the ways \nin which requirements, constraints, systems breakdown, analysis, accepted design \nprocedures, heuristics,    and design decisions interact with one another. Our discussion \nin this chapter will begin by recalling the physical elements making up an end-to-end \nspace system. The second section analyzes space system speci fi cation and design and \nhow they relate to the principal aim of this book, as de fi ned in Section   1.1    , to produce \nan \u201carchitecture\u201d for the space system. This is followed by sections describing how \nvarious constraints \u2013 those of cost, risk, and scheduling \u2013 in fl uence system design and \nhow for each mission the varying degrees of emphasis given to each of the constraints \nin fl uences the design. The next section deals with the different types of requirements \nand how they in fl uence the design. The  fi fth section describes the speci fi c tools used for \ndesign: performance analysis,    functional analysis,    trade-off   s, breakdowns, functional \napportioning   , budget apportioning,    and how concurrent design    facilities can help \nmission design. A  fi nal subsection of that section discusses dependability. The following \nsection looks at the design from an end-to-end perspective   , with subsections examining \nmeasurement methods for mission effectiveness    and their limitations, the problems \nassociated with numerical and probabilistic    approaches to design optimization and on \nthe impact of safety margins   , and the mistakes and errors regarding the actual perfor-\nmances of space systems. The chapter ends with an analysis of nonnumerical aids to \ndesign   : heuristic processes    and the need for developing sensitivity in seeking for a \nbalance between con fl icting needs. \n\n    Chapter 5   \n\n System Design as a Synchronic Process       \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n96 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    5.1.   Space system elements \n\n In Figure   1.3     the design of space systems was described as a recursive process where \nthe highest-level elements are de fi ned  fi rst, followed progressively thereafter by \nlower-level components. The  fi rst step in any design is to de fi ne the elements resulting \nfrom a meaningful  fi rst-level decomposition of the end-to-end system. Wertz-Larson 1  \nuses a division into architectural elements, including:\n\n   The subject or event being observed, hereafter called the observable     \u2022 \n  Payload or instruments acquiring information about the observable  \u2022 \n  Spacecraft bus providing support to the instruments  \u2022 \n  Launcher  \u2022 \n  Proposed orbit  \u2022 \n  Ground segment  \u2022 \n  Communications architecture  \u2022 \n  Operational concept    \u2022 \n\n ECSS,    2  on the other hand, uses a two-level division into physical segments:\n\n   Launch segment, divided into launcher and launch facilities  \u2022 \n  Ground segment, divided into mission control center   , communications network, \u2022 \nground stations   , payload data management facility, and ground support equipment     \n  Space segment, divided in spacecraft bus and instruments    \u2022 \n\n Wertz-Larson\u2019s functional approach is the best suited for the process of de fi ning a \nmission\u2019s overall architecture, and this text will employ a division nearly identical to \nthat of Wertz-Larson; the only difference being the division of the ground segment    into \ntwo different elements as in the ECSS    approach: mission control    and instrument data \nprocessing   . This supplementary division is selected because these two parts of the \nground segment are driven by different design criteria and do not interact strongly with \none another. The resulting division into elements followed here are (Figure  5.1 ): \n\n   Observable: the events we want to observe. The observable under study is the root \u2022 \nof the mission. It will be seen in later chapters that the observable directly shapes \npreferred operational methods as well as data usage.  \n  Orbit: the satellite\u2019s path. The orbit is selected from the rather limited set of \u2022 \npossibilities allowed by the laws of Newton and required by the observable.  \n  Launcher: the device used to inject the satellite into space. Launchers    are usually \u2022 \nselected from a limited set of possibilities:  fi rst, because reliable and reasonably \npriced launchers are rare, and second, because programmatic constraints often \nforbid or favor launchers from speci fi c national sources.  \n  Instruments: the devices that obtain the information about the events to be \u2022 \nobserved. Given that each mission is aimed at very speci fi c observational needs, \ninstruments are generally designed speci fi cally for each mission.  \n  Platform: the device that supports the instruments. The platform helps instruments \u2022 \nto ful fi ll their functions and sends and receives information from the satellite to the \n\n      1   Space Mission Analysis and Design, Wertz-Larson, Microcosm Presm, Kluwer 1999.  \n    2   Policy and Principles, ECSS   -E-00A, ESA 1999.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n97System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\nground.

The operation\u2019s \nground elements are normally based on an existing infrastructure with adaptations \nas needed. For any needs not covered by existing infrastructures, new elements are \ndesigned and built.  \n  Instrument downlink ground stations    and instrument data processing and distribu-\u2022 \ntion centers   .

The need \nfor multiple satellites might arise from a need to provide long-term services by  fl ying \nsuccessive satellites, or in order to split demanding requirements between several \nsatellites  fl ying simultaneously, for instance, missions requiring large amounts of data \nor a high frequency of observation. \n\n The de fi nition of any space system must start from a broad de fi nition of each of \nthese elements and the interfaces between them. Once this has been established, a \ndetailed de fi nition of each element can be developed.  \n\nObservable\n\nInstrument\n\nPlatform\nOrbitLauncher\n\nTelemeasure and\ntelecommand ground station(s)\n\nInstruments downlink\nground station(s)\n\nInstrument\ndata\n\nprocessing \n\nMission\nControl\n\nInterface with mission Consumers\n\n  Figure 5.1.

System speci fi cation, system design, and system architect    \n\n Before receiving de fi nitive authorization for a fully funded project, the process of \nmission design involves:\n\n   The customer   , in most cases a space agency  \u2022 \n  The industrial supplier,    in most case a space engineering company    \u2022 \n\n In principle, the customer    establishes the requirements and the supplier    will \nproduce \u2013 and later implement \u2013 the design; nevertheless, functions allocation   , the \ncorresponding system decomposition,    and budget allocations    are all part of the itera-\ntive process of system speci fi cation and system design. The process of establishing \nrequirements never entails specifying concrete physical design    parameters, but a \nspeci fi cation can perfectly well specify functional or even physical decompositions \nof the system. This effectively combines the processes of both system design and \nsystem speci fi cation. The consumer   , for example, might require the rapid delivery of \ndata once it has been produced. This generates a requirement for acceptable data \nlatency   , but the customer could well specify the use of a data relay satellite   , or \nencourage or discourage speci fi c locations for ground stations   . This perfectly legiti-\nmate kind of requirement stipulates an allocation of functions    and strongly in fl uences \nthe design. By specifying the approach he prefers, the customer has a strong hand in \nshaping the design provided by the supplier. On the other hand, the speci fi cation must \nnever demand design features, and the customer\u2019s involvement in the detailed design \nis forcefully limited. \n\n Both the customer    and supplier    are involved in the design process    and before \nproject approval both will need to maintain an architect   \u2019s broad perspective in order \nto allow a progressive top-down    de fi nition of the system. As the system becomes \nprogressively more de fi ned the design team will separate into those with an archi-\ntect\u2019s perspective and those focusing on detailed design. The mission architect    can be \nde fi ned as collectively the group of people de fi ning the mission and who at the \nsame time are keeping a generalist perspective over the mission. This concurs with \nthe de fi nition of system architectural design offered in Section   2.2     as consisting \nessentially of a special perspective over system engineering and system design. It is \nevident that any person making design decisions having multiple or major impacts on \na mission is performing the duties of a system architect, because these kinds of deci-\nsions can only be made from a generalist perspective. This is true for early design \ndecisions in areas related to instruments   , mission orbit,    or operational approach   . \n\n It shall be noted that no new architectural work is necessary in implementing a \nsystem that is not innovative, in which most components are standard. Architectural \ndesign has been de fi ned as the work prior to a well-informed decision to go-ahead \nwith a fully funded project, and projects with low novelty levels can be initiated \nwith little previous work. It can be said that  only unique systems need to be the \nsubject of the architectural design process     ,  but nearly all space systems are in \nfact unique. On the other hand, many apparently noninnovative space systems \nalways need some type of adaptation when applied. In some cases, an existing \nsatellite is used in a different environment, requires redesign of obsolete hardware, \nor is forced to use a different launcher or data  fl ow, for example, a new data relay \nsatellite   . In this case some level of new architectural design will be needed   . \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_2\n\n\n99System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\n Design decisions always entail trade-offs between alternatives. The supplier    offers \ndesign alternatives, trades-off between them, and chooses a winning approach accord-\ning to previously established selection criteria. Still, the customer    always reviews and \ndiscusses the supplier\u2019s choice of approaches. In the highest-level trade-offs\u2014such as \norbit selection or the attitude control concept \u2013 the customer is directly involved with \nthe trade-off    process, but trade-offs related to detailed design are left almost completely \nin the hands of the supplier. The relationship between all these activities \u2013 requirements \nestablishment, design, apportioning, and trade-offs \u2013 are summarized in Figure  5.2 , \nwhich shows how agreements reached on design alternatives will often entail the \nupdating of allocations and even of highest-level requirements. As we have indicated \nrepeatedly, functional design   , physical design,    and requirements establishment are all \ntightly interrelated before project approval.  \n\n The process of de fi ning and implementing the system includes four kinds of \nactivities:\n\n   Scoping and certi fi cation, which both form part of the system\u2019s speci fi cation \u2022 \ndomain and are therefore principally the customer   \u2019s responsibility  \n  Partitioning and aggregation, which form part of the system design domain    and are \u2022 \ntherefore principally the supplier   \u2019s responsibility    \n\n Scoping is a series of procedures for selecting and rejecting approaches de fi ning \nthe mission, de fi ning requirements and constraints, and deciding what is inside and \noutside the system. Scoping is the art of de fi ning the system\u2019s boundaries and \nestablishing its requirements and constraints. Proper scoping requires a clear aim. \nThe consumer    will provide the aim in mission statements or a mission requirements \ndocument    (Section   3.2.1    ). At the same time, the sponsor    provides constraints that \nlimit the choice of acceptable mission de fi nitions; for example, demanding that the \nmission be designed to cost or that failure cannot be tolerated (Figure  5.3 ).  \n\n The certi fi cation or veri fi cation of a system offers a guarantee to both the paying \nsponsor    and the nonpaying consumer    that the system is  fi t for use. The customer   \u2019s \nrole is to  fi rst de fi ne a system that can be unequivocally certi fi ed and then eventually \n\nHighest level requirements\n\nPreliminary allocation of budgets and functions\n\nDesign implicationsFunctions apportioning Budgets apportioning\n\nTrade-off design alternatives\n\nUpdate allocation of budgets and functions\n\nIf needed update highest level requirements\n\n  Figure 5.2.

Effective certi fi cation, that is, quali fi cation or acceptance, \nimplies the ensuing payment of the agreed-upon price to the supplier   . This is the \nreason it must be completely unambiguous. To provide credibility to the cost and \nperformance estimations, the architectural de fi nition process requires de fi ning a sys-\ntem that can be clearly veri fi ed and establishing unambiguous requirements that can \nbe properly tested. This is re fl ected in the heuristic sentence:  De fi ne how a require-\nment is to be veri fi ed at the same time it is established . The need for veri fi ability \nwas recalled in Section   3.5    . \n\n Aggregation and partitioning are the grouping and separation of related solutions \nand problems. They are two faces of the same coin: proper system design. This entails \nmaintaining a balance between the analytical/partition activities \u2013 such as functional \nand physical decomposition \u2013 and those addressing synthesis/aggregation \u2013 such as \nthe analysis of end-to-end performances   . A balance in the allocation of functions    and \nresources to the different system elements and components is also crucial. \n\n  System aggregation and partitioning is more art than science. It is synthesis \noriented, not analytical, and science is nearly always analytical.  Establishing a \nscienti fi c system aggregation and partition method or tool kit is a dif fi cult task, \nbecause the process is unstructured and eclectic; heuristic but also artistic. The whole \nsecond part of this book starting in Chapter   7     and  fi nishing in Chapter   12     is an attempt \nto develop the sensitivity necessary to properly perform the aggregation and partition \nof a space system.  \n\n    5.3.   Design against constraints \n\n Section   4.4     introduced the concept of a programmatic framework    as the set of rules \nestablished by the sponsor    for the implementation of potential new space projects. \nSections   4.5     and   4.6     studied different types of space missions and classi fi ed them \n\n  Figure 5.3.

All these sections revolve around the need \nto establish a rational balance between the future mission\u2019s level of tolerance toward: \ncost overruns, failure risks, and  fi nal performance. The establishment of these different \nlevels of tolerance is not a decision of the architectural de fi nition team but of the special \nprogrammatic guidelines of the project, which in certain cases will just have broad \nguidelines, while in others they will establish speci fi c and compulsory plans on:\n\n   The number of, and the workload associated with the performance of, formal \u2022 \nreviews    (Section   6.4    )  \n  De fi nition of the degree of documentation to be formally delivered by the supplier    \u2022 \nto the customer     \n  De fi nition of the developmental logic and number of components and satellite \u2022 \nmodels to be manufactured and tested before the  fi nal  fl ight model (Section   4.9.4    )  \n  Reduction or increase in the level of product assurance    efforts  \u2022 \n  Number and  fi delity \u2013 hence cost \u2013 of tests  \u2022 \n  Establishment of the supplier   \u2019s level of dependence with respect to the customer    \u2022 \nand establishment of the customer\u2019s level of involvement with the implementation \nprocess    \n\n The set of all these decisions can be called the mission\u2019s \u201cprogrammatic guide-\nlines.\u201d Most of the measures indicated above are applied during the mission\u2019s imple-\nmentation phases, not the architectural de fi nition phases; that is, the architectural \nde fi nition team\u2019s work directly related to programmatic directives will be modest. \nNevertheless, the programmatic directives\u2019 impact on optimal mission design is crucial \nbecause the design must be coherent with them. \n\n The following sections will analyze the impact of cost risks and schedule on \nsystem design. \n\n    5.3.1.   Cost \n\n There is a heuristic system design maxim that claims, \u201c Customers will accept delays \nbut will tolerate cost      overruns only with extreme dif fi culty. \u201d This means that cost \nis the most important constraint   . \n\n Cost containment is at the heart of all proper engineering, and a slightly tongue-\nin-cheek de fi nition of engineering could be \u201caccomplish with one euro or dollar what \nany fool could do with ten.\u201d According to this viewpoint, each proper system \nde fi nition decision must be made with cost containment in mind; hence, design for \ncost minimization would be the essence of all proper design, not a mere component \nof it. Nonetheless, it is both possible and practical to analyze cost reduction    measures \nand their impact on system design as a separate issue, and this will be the aim of this \nsection. Cost reductions can be sought in two different areas:\n\n   Measures in the way the mission is designed and organized could reduce costs; \u2022 \nthese alternative approaches are discussed in Chapter   13    .  \n  Proper mission de fi nition effort can reduce cost. The aim of the present section is \u2022 \nto discuss this.    \n\n In cases where the sponsor    requires that the mission be strictly design to co   st, the \ndesigner must play with performance and risk in order to satisfy the cost constraint    \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_6\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_13\n\n\n102 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nwhile keeping the risk of failure moderate and providing performance levels still \nacceptable to the consumer   . Reducing performance will directly reduce costs, and a \ndesign-to-cost mission is one whose performance is inevitably bound by the cost \nlimit. Excessive reductions in performance can also be avoided by increasing risk; for \nexample, by eliminating redundancy, using lower-quality electronic components, or \nby reducing the frequency of communications between the satellite and the mission \ncontrol center   . Any of these measures will reduce costs without reducing perfor-\nmance, but the  fi rst one risks ending the mission in case any key nonredundant com-\nponent fails. The second measure would reduce the satellite\u2019s reliability by the use of \nlow-quality components, while the third measure will increase the interval between \nany in-orbit failure and the possibility of ground intervention    to remedy it. \n\n One always-valid way to simultaneously reduce costs and risk is to devote a pro-\nportionally large amount of the budget to the mission architectural de fi nition phases   . \nThis investment will be repaid with much larger cost reductions during the project \nimplementation phases. The following quotation from NASA\u2019s system handbook 3  is \nrelevant here:\n\n  Typically, by the time the preferred system\u2019s overall concept is selected, between 50 and 70 percent \nof the system\u2019s life-cycle cost    has been \u201clocked in.\u201d By the time a preliminary system design is \nselected, this  fi gure may be as high as 90 percent. This presents a major dilemma to the system \nengineer   , who must lead this selection process. Just at the time when decisions are most critical, the \nstate of information about the alternatives is least certain. Uncertainty about costs is a fact of \nsystems engineering. This suggests that efforts to acquire better information about the life-cycle \ncost of each alternative early in the project life cycle potentially has very high payoffs.   \n\n Two important messages are conveyed here:\n\n    \u2022 When the fully funded project begins, almost all the important decisions \nin fl uencing the  fi nal cost have already been made .  \n   \u2022 Early heavy efforts regarding system de fi nition will lead to optimal design \nsolutions that will reduce  fi nal implementation costs .    \n\n So mission architectural de fi nition phases    must be long, detailed, and well funded \nif costs are to be reduced. This apparent contradiction between expending a bit more \nat the beginning of the design process    to avoid expending much more at the end was \ndiscussed in Section   1.1    , and is supported by the data in Figure   1.1    . \n\n Another approach to cost reduction    that also avoids risk increase is to produce \nrobust designs that reduce them simultaneously. The word \u201crobust\u201d is used here to \nindicate designs that are simple, well proven and  fi t for purpose; for example, simple-\nshaped satellites without deployable solar arrays    provide both high reliability \u2013 \nreducing the risk of failure \u2013 and lower costs. The cubic con fi guration of the highly \neffective, low-cost SSTL satellite shown in Figure   11.10     is an example of this. \nAnother example, also from SSTL, is the use of old-fashioned, low-performance but \ncheap and well-proven processors for satellite data handling (see Section   11.4.4    ). \nRobust simple designs have a snowball effect, providing cost reduction potential \nthroughout the system. A simple satellite, for instance, minimizes the need for inter-\nventions by the ground segment    for control and monitoring of the satellite. \n\n   3  NASA System Engineering Handbook, SP-610S, NASA 1995.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n103System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\n A third possibility for reducing costs without lessening performance is to improve \nthe  fl ow of information among the supplier   , customer,    and consumer   . Concurrent design   , \nthat is, designs in which all the technical and scienti fi c expertise interact together in \na single place, also enables experts to understand the problems faced by one another. \nThis mutual interaction permits a better understanding of what requirements can be \nchanged or relaxed with a minimum impact on consumer satisfaction, and those that \ncannot be relaxed without damaging the mission\u2019s essence. The easy  fl ow of informa-\ntion, on the other hand, could be in contradiction with necessary formal methods of \nproject control. Nevertheless, during a mission\u2019s architectural de fi nition phases    the \ncustomer and the supplier have yet to establish large project teams, the volume of \ndocumentation generated is still moderate, and it is possible for everyone involved to \nbe aware of everyone else\u2019s activities.  \n\n    5.3.2.   Risk \n\n Risk refers to the possibility that something that threatens the mission\u2019s integrity \ncould occur, such as component failure, major mission performance degradation, or \neven cancelation of the mission itself. Risk was thoroughly examined in Chapter   4    : \nSection   4.9     discussed risk    constraints and techniques for risk management   ; Section \n  4.9.1     introduced qualitative procedures for classifying and handling risk; Section   4.9.2     \nintroduced quantitative risk management; Section   4.9.3    analyzed the concept of tech-\nnical readiness levels; and Section   4.9.4    analyzed development approaches and model \nphilosophy   . The present section will discuss the impact on design of risk acceptance \nor avoidance. \n\n In the early stages of the space age, risk-averse missions entailed above-average \nfunding and a comfortable schedule. The additional time and funds allow a conserva-\ntive model philosophy   , a large number of detailed project reviews,    and comprehensive \nrealistic testing. A comfortable schedule also facilitated staggering the development \nstages so that the manufacturing of the  fl ight model does not start until all the compo-\nnents and elements have been thoroughly validated. This relaxed approach to program \ndevelopment and funding is relatively slow and is now out of fashion. Section \n  4.9.4    compared the highly conservative three-model approach (development, \nquali fi cation, and  fl ight) of the ESA\u2019s 1970s Ulysses    mission, with the model-and-a-\nhalf approach (avionics test bench and proto- fl ight) favored today. On the other hand, \nduring the late 1990s NASA\u2019s excessive push in the direction of \u201cfaster cheaper better   \u201d \nled to several major mission failures. There is a permanent tension between reducing \ncost and increasing risk but thorough (hence slow and well funded) development of \ncritical technologies    before full project go-ahead always improves the technology \nreadiness level    and it is extremely effective at reducing risks to the mission. \n\n One issue deserving mention is that most methods for risk characterization and \nmanagement are qualitative, not quantitative. The formal techniques for a project\u2019s \ncriticality classi fi cation (see Table   4.1     of Section   4.6    ); the classi fi cation of risks as \nsigni fi cant, major, and critical (depicted in Table   4.2    ); or the classi fi cation of technology \nreadiness levels from 1 to 9 (Figure   4.4    ) are qualitative. This makes risk estimation \nmethods apparently less rigorous than numerical cost or performance estimations. \nNonetheless, the qualitative de fi nition of a mission as risk-averse or as risk-tolerant \nprovides clear guidelines for the system\u2019s design, both technical and programmatic. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n104 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nThe de fi nition of qualitative risk guidelines    will also act as a guide for the establishment \nof numerical availability or reliability requirements. \n\n Operational missions    (Section   4.5.4    ) ful fi ll extremely important social needs \u2013 such \nas weather prediction \u2013 and have low levels of tolerance to failure. These missions \nuse relatively conservative technology and normally employ multiple satellites, \nallowing the use of in-orbit or on-ground spares in case of failure. In general, the \nimplementation of a mission using several small satellites    instead of a single large \none will reduce risk, and this approach does not inevitably increase costs by unac-\nceptable amounts. Technology demonstration missions, by contrast, are risk-tolerant. \nThey are also cost constrained, so the mission de fi nition can perfectly well select \nlow-cost but high-risk solutions. At any rate, any serious mission de fi nition effort \nmust assume a plausible evolution of the readiness of the technologies required by the \nmission, and the proposed mission concept must not demand dramatic and unlikely \ntechnical breakthroughs in order to be viable.  \n\n    5.3.3.   Schedule \n\n Section   4.10     analyzed space mission schedule    determination. We saw there that the \nduration of any endeavor is strictly determined by the tasks to be performed and by \nthe resources available for executing them. Also, the heuristic maxim at the beginning \nof Section  5.3.1  pointed out that schedule delays are generally less critical than cost \noverruns. It can be deduced from all this that efforts to ensure schedule compliance \nduring the de fi nition phase will be proportionally smaller than the corresponding \nefforts to minimize cost or risk. Nevertheless, there are situations in which schedule \nful fi llment is critical, for example:\n\n   Operational missions    that provide vital public services, which must be delivered \u2022 \nwithout interruption.  \n  Some classes of advancement-of-science missions can only be performed at \u2022 \nspeci fi c times. The aim of ESA\u2019s Giotto mission was to study Halley\u2019s comet and \nits launch was timed to rendezvous    with the comet. A strict respect for the sched-\nule was crucial for successfully intercepting the comet; otherwise the mission \nwould have become useless.    \n\n It is vital for schedule-critical missions to have a high level of technical readiness \nfrom the very beginning of the project. The use of components featuring a high level \nof technical readiness will reduce schedules because they increase the likelihood of a \nsmooth project implementation as well as permitting the simpli fi cation of the model \nphilosophy    and a decrease in development and quali fi cation tests, while still main-\ntaining reasonable risk    levels for the overall mission implementation. In Giotto\u2019s \ncase, the satellite bus\u2019s design was closely based on ESA\u2019s Geos satellite, which had \nproven its effectiveness before development of Giotto had begun. Nevertheless, the \nGeos satellite needed certain modi fi cations and developments in order to cope with \nthe dusty and hostile environment around comet Halley. As we saw for designs need-\ning to satisfy cost constraints, the use of well-funded mission de fi nition phases will \nensure that all technologies are mature and that the implementation phases will unfold \nsmoothly and without delays.   \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n105System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\n    5.4.   Design against requirements \n\n Design is fundamentally design against requirements    and the second part of this \nbook, Chapters   7    ,   8    ,   9    ,   10    ,   11    , and   12    , will discuss in detail how to design against the \nrequirements of the distinct parts of a space system. So the present section will just \nfocus on how requirements impact design in general, and how design responds to, and \ninteracts with, them. \n\n The European ECSS    4  collection of standards provides a sequential view of the \nprocess:\n\n    1.    Needs are researched  \n    2.    The requirements associated with these needs are established  \n    3.    A system design ful fi lling the requirements is de fi ned  \n    4.    The system is implemented     \n\n This sequential view is also implicit in the traditional names for the design phases \nrecalled in Section   1.5    . Strictly following this scheme, requirements are treated as \nfully  fi xed. Nevertheless, as discussed in Chapter   3    , the consumer   \u2019s wishes cannot be \ntransformed into  fi rm requirements until both the consumer and sponsor    understand \nthe risks and costs involved in their implementation, until the sponsor has agreed to \n fi nance the project, and until the supplier    has provided a reasonable design with a \nwell-substantiated cost estimation   . Therefore, during the early phases of mission \nde fi nition, design and requirements interact until they mutually accommodate each \nother, reaching a balance between needs, means, and feasibility, between require-\nments, constraints, and design. \n\n As the consumer    is at the origin of the mission, the most important requirements \nwill be connected to the ful fi llment of the consumer\u2019s needs. Nearly all the require-\nments directly related to the three kinds of system effectiveness metrics \u2013 data quality, \ndata quantity, and mission responsiveness    (see Section   3.4.2    ) \u2013 will be among the \nmost important and will strongly shape the mission. This is not to say that require-\nments not directly related to consumer needs are unimportant. In a mission with \nstringent and unavoidable limits on satellite mass   , all the design requirements related \nto structural design and mass margins    would be important; nevertheless, even in situ-\nations like this, the consumer\u2019s needs will drive the mission, because satellite mass \nwill have been determined by the need to include all the instruments required by the \nconsumer, and if the consumer agrees to eliminate one or more instruments, the mass \nproblem will automatically disappear. It is obvious that reducing performance, that is, \nrelaxing requirements, will reduce both costs and risks. The mission architectural \nde fi nition team must identify what requirements can be relaxed; in order to \nsigni fi cantly reduce costs and risks while keeping the consumer essentially satis fi ed. \nOne clear way to accommodate design and requirements is to express requirements \nnot as a single value but as range of possible performances: threshold, breakthrough, \nand goal (Section   3.2.2    ). This expression of needs in terms of ranges is quite normal \nin the very early stages of system de fi nition and facilitates the study of alternative \ndesigns with increasing levels of performances and with their correspondingly higher \n\n   4  Project Phasing and Planning, ECSS   -M-30, ESA 1996.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\n\n\n106 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nlevels of cost and risk. Section   3.4.1     pointed out that although all requirements should \nbe ful fi lled they are not all equal and that some of them are more important than \nothers. It was also mentioned that identifying the most important requirements is \nnot dif fi cult because the whole process of mission de fi nition revolves around them. \nA good heuristic rule is to consider the requirements\u2019 importance from the perspec-\ntive of the Pareto Principle   . The Italian sociologist Vilfredo Pareto pointed out that in \nmany situations 80 % of the outcome derives from 20 % of the causes. Applied to \nrequirements, the principle could be reformulated to provide two heuristic maxims; the \n fi rst is in line with the previous statement that not all the requirements are equal:\n\n    \u2022 80 % of the effort employed to satisfy requirements      will be absorbed by just \n20 % of the requirements.     \n\n The second applies to each individual numerical requirement and could be formu-\nlated thus:\n\n    \u2022 80 % of the total effort will be needed to ful fi ll the last 20 % of the required \nperformance.     \n\n N. Augustine 5  has produced a slightly different formulation:  \u201cThe last 10 % of \nthe performance sought generates 1/3 of the cost and 2/3 of the problems.\u201d  \n\n Heuristic    maxims are not laws of physics, but in this case their thrust    is clear: \ndesign efforts should focus on the few areas of absolute interest to the consumer    and \non vigorous discussions with the customer    about possible requirements relaxations \nthat would yield a cheaper and less risky system. Nevertheless, the mission\u2019s ultimate \nvalue is measured in relation to the consumer\u2019s needs, and the  fi nal decision on \nrequirements relaxation shall be in the consumer\u2019s hands.  \n\n    5.5.   Tools for design \n\n    5.5.1.   Analysis and design \n\n Analysis    is a Greek work whose original meaning referred to untying a knot. It implies \nthe rational examination of something by dividing it into its individual parts and \nunderstanding how they interact. Analysis includes any structured approach to rational \nproblem characterization and solving. ECSS    de fi nes 6  analysis as \u201ca method, which \nentails performing a theoretical or empirical evaluation by accepted analytical tech-\nniques. The selected techniques may typically include systematics, statistics, qualita-\ntive design analysis, modeling and computer simulation.\u201d Hence, analysis includes not \nonly mathematical quantitative methods but also rationally systematic qualitative \napproaches to understanding problems. Analysis is the basic tool available to system \ndesign because during the architectural de fi nition phases    test results will be rare. \n\n From the architectural perspective, analysis can be divided in two parts:\n\n   System analyses     \u2022 \n  Engineering disciplines analyses       \u2022 \n\n   5  Augustine\u2019s Law, Law Norman Augustine, AIAA 1983.  \n   6  Glossary of Terms, ECSS   -P 001, ESA 2004.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\n\n\n107System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\n System analysis includes all inquiries aimed at supporting decision makers on \nglobal courses of action. System analysis examines relevant goals and the tools \nneeded to accomplish them, as well as comparing the cost, performances, and risks \nof the available options for reaching them. Consequently, system analysis includes all \nof the cost, performance, and risk analyses discussed in previous sections. From the \nstart, the stated aim of this book has been that of keeping a global perspective, \nfocusing on the higher-level aspects of mission de fi nition. So this and the following \nsections of this chapter will concentrate on qualitative and quantitative system analysis \napproaches: trade-off   s, functional analysis   , budgets    apportioning   , use of safety margins   , \nheuristic processes,    and end-to-end mission effectiveness    metrics. Highest-level \ndecision making demands high-quality support, as detailed, realistic, and quantitative \nas possible. In some cases, when the structure of the model and uncertainties allow, a \nnumerical, analytical solution will be feasible. This will be studied in Section  5.8 . \n\n To support the system de fi nition process, the use of quantitative and qualitative \nanalytical methods from the different engineering disciplines will be crucial. These \nmethods include quantitative \u201cmathematical\u201d procedures such as orbital, structural, \nand thermal analyses, as well as a qualitative rational comparison of alternatives; for \nexample, comparing liquid or solid lubricants for use in space mechanisms. Also in \nline with our stated global perspective, these procedures will not be covered in detail \nin this book. Although Chapters   7    ,   8    ,   9    ,   10    ,   11    , and   12     will systematically examine \nall relevant areas of space design, describing the numerous design decisions to be made \nand how they interact and the analytical methods used in the different engineering \ndisciplines will be touched on only brie fl y. \n\n Any system design, even the most preliminary, must include a demonstration of its \nfeasibility, supported by an analysis that speci fi es the dimensions of key design \nparameters and demonstrates that it ful fi lls the mission\u2019s key requirements. \nNevertheless, a single-point design supported by an analysis demonstrating the \nful fi llment of requirements by no means guarantees that the design is optimal, and it \nis always necessary to support system design with alternatives including an analysis \nof the parametric sensitivity of the system\u2019s performances to changes in the most \nimportant requirements or design features. One design point is insuf fi cient; it is \nnecessary to research many alternatives. \n\n Analyses performed during the architectural de fi nition phases    previous to project \napproval will have different levels of complexity. The analysis supporting the \ndesign\u2019s earliest stages is always brief and has limited reach, while those undertaken \nduring later stages will be progressively more thorough. The need to begin with a \nsimple feasibility assessment is valid for all levels of system design from the highest \nand more abstract to the more detailed and concrete. Initially, the general feasibility \nof the highest-level overall architecture design must be established by means of a \nvery simple calculation and heuristic processes   . A second design loop will permit the \nmuch more detailed trade studies to be made, supported by end-to-end mission effec-\ntiveness    calculations, \u2013 mainly instrument-related \u2013 as well as a mission effectiveness \nparametric sensitivity analysis for the overall architecture. The  fi rst set of basic \nfeasibility studies of the mission\u2019s less innovative and risky elements will sustain the \nsecond design loop. The  fi nal set of documents allowing a well-informed decision to \nbe made regarding authorization of the fully funded project must provide credible \ncost, risk, and performance estimations. In order for these to be credible, it is necessary \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\n\n\n108 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nto provide more than a simple preliminary or overall design. The necessary degree of \ndetail will be different for each design component, and must be in line with the levels \nof novelty and risk associated with each component:\n\n   Standard components possessing a high technology readiness level require a low \u2022 \nlevel of detail.  \n  Components in fl uencing the ful fi llment of important mission requirements    or \u2022 \nneeding special modi fi cations or developments must be designed and documented \nto a fairly detailed design level.  \n  Components playing a fundamental role on the ful fi llment of key mission require-\u2022 \nments    (principally mission products    quality) or that need extensive new develop-\nments must be designed and documented to a very detailed level, as is often the \ncase with instruments   . The design must be supported by comprehensive analysis \nand as well as actual manufacturing and testing of selected particularly risky \ncomponents.    \n\n Space system design documentation must also be end-to-end and should include \nnot only the design of the satellite but also the design of the ground segment   . The ground \nsegment design should include a functional explanation of how to operate the system \nand how to interface with the consumers   : how their requests are to be received and \nhow instrument data will be processed and distributed. The architecture must also \ninclude mathematical models providing end-to-end mission effectiveness  fi gures   .  \n\n    5.5.2.   Functional analysis and functional decomposition \n\n Function is the intended effect of a system and functional analysis    is the process of \nidentifying, describing, and relating all the functions that a system must perform in \norder to ful fi ll its objectives. Functional analysis supports the followings tasks during \nthe space mission de fi nition process:\n\n   Ascertainment all the requirements to be ful fi lled.  \u2022 \n  Identi fi cation of system effectiveness measures.  \u2022 \n  Identi fi cation of mission reference scenarios regarding nominal and degraded \u2022 \nmodes of operation and study alternative operational approaches.  \n  Assessment of requirements concerning the environments to be encountered \u2022 \nthroughout the mission.  \n  Identi fi cation via trade-off    studies of the alternatives able to meet the system\u2019s \u2022 \nobjectives.  \n  Providing insights for the builders of mission effectiveness models.    \u2022 \n\n This list includes almost all the highest-level activities required in the earliest \nphases of mission de fi nition. As we can see, most of the work done at this stage is \nactually functional analysis   . \n\n Functional analysis starts from system requirements and derives the functions, \nwhich must be performed to satisfy all the highest-level functional requirements   . \nEach function shall be described in terms of inputs, outputs, and interfaces. As always \nwith space mission de fi nition processes, functional analysis    is performed following a \ntop-down    hierarchical decomposition of functions, which permits the derivation of \n\n\n\n109System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\nlower-level functions from the higher-level ones, producing function trees. This process \nin turn permits deducing sets of lower-level requirements from each higher-level \nfunctional requirement. At the top level a mission statement    or mission requirements \ndocument    shall provide the functions. The functional analysis will be the source for \nthe  fi rst functional speci fi cation    (Section   3.2.1    ) that is a key milestone in the de fi nition \nof any space system. This process of system decomposition    will create a parallel set \nof functional blocks that will de fi ne a functional concept and will drive associated \nphysical concepts. \n\n The most common functional analysis    technique is the Functional Flow Block \nDiagram. These diagrams describe the network of events leading to the discharge of \na function. The  fl ow diagram represents the logical sequence of what is happening, \ndepicting inputs and outputs, tasks, and relationships. What they do not show are \ndurations, which means that  fl ow diagrams are not a good tool for understanding the \nful fi llment of time-critical requirements. This is accomplished by timeline analysis   , \nwhich includes durations and is used to analyze the necessary requirements for time-\ncritical functions. Another functional analysis technique is that of N2 diagrams, \nwhich are used to develop data interfaces in software   -intensive systems, but they are \nnot normally used in de fi ning satellites. They employ square matrixes of  N  rows by \n N  columns that register the information  fl ows between functions in row  i  with \nfunctions of column  j , or mark a zero if there is no interface. \n\n As said above, most of the work in the early stages of space system de fi nition is \nactually functional analysis   , but this does not means that \u201cfunctional analysis\u201d \ndocuments must be produced by strictly following one or another of the techniques \ndescribed in the previous paragraphs. In point of fact, the functions of a space system \nand the elements performing these functions are very similar from one project to the \nnext and there is normally no wide scope for considering dramatically different \nsystem approaches. Indeed, the analysis undertaken in Section  5.1  is a high-level \nfunctional analysis that can be applied to almost any space system, and the division \ninto elements shown in Figure  5.1  illustrates the fundamental functional decomposi-\ntion of nearly all space systems.  \n\n    5.5.3.   Trade-offs and design \n\n A trade-off    is a rational approach helping to select alternative solutions. Applied to \ndesign, the purpose of the trade-off is to ensure that the optimal design is selected. In \nprinciple, a trade-off requires the following steps:\n\n    1.    Understand and make explicit the requirements and system effectiveness metrics \n(Section   3.4.2    ).  \n\n    2.    Devise design alternatives able to meet the requirements.  \n    3.    Ideally, determine a mission-effectiveness function, which combines all the effec-\n\ntiveness metrics into a single value. This function shall be a mathematically useful \nand objective one.  \n\n    4.    Include uncertainties by determining probabilities and determine sponsor    risk \nacceptance/aversion pro fi le.  \n\n    5.    Evaluate the design alternatives in terms of their mission effectiveness   .  \n    6.    Evaluate these alternatives in terms of cost    and risk   .  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\n\n\n110 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    7.    Rank the alternatives according to a selection rule that shall include the bene fi t and \ncost and that should take into account probabilities on nonnominal outcomes and \nthe risk aversion pro fi le of the sponsor   .  \n\n    8.    Select one or several best alternative according to the selection rules.  \n    9.    Continue the design work only with the selected alternative(s).     \n\n The ideal situation would be when all the steps from 1 to 9 could be implemented. \nThis would permit a fully numerical handling of decision making able to determine \nnot only the best alternative but also the best performance/cost point for each alterna-\ntive. The steps indicated above are summarized in the following  fi gure. \n\n This purely numerical scenario is an ideal that should be strived for but that in \npractice is rarely possible. The limitations of numerical reliability calculations will be \ndiscussed in Section  5.5.6 , and the limitations of mission effectiveness    models will \nbe reviewed in Section  5.6.2 . Risk analysis \u2013 as discussed in Section   4.9     \u2013 is fundamen-\ntally quantitative, and an entirely numerical approach to trade-off selection could \nprovide a false sense of security, frequently concealing more than it reveals. It is often \nbetter to make subjective but explicit and legitimate value judgments than to buttress \nthe selection with the apparent support of mathematical solidity.  Apparently unbiased \nnumerical methods often hide highly subjective choices within their algorithms ! \n\n One design heuristic maxim claims that \u201c the eye is a good architect    \u201d that is, that \ndesign solutions pleasant to the eye are good design solutions. Given the dangers \nassociated with strictly numeric trade-off    procedures, the importance of simplicity \nand even esthetics as a supplementary aid to trade-offs should not be underestimated. \nIt is important to develop an intuitive understanding of overall design solutions that \nembody an optimal use of resources and a balanced allocation of functions   . As \nalready said in Section  5.4  the aim of the whole second half of this book from Chapters \n  7    ,   8    ,   9    ,   10    ,   11    , and   12     is just to develop this intuitive understanding (Figure  5.4 ).  \n\n It is also necessary to make decision at many different levels and in many different \nsituations, and the degree of the trade-off   s complexity and formalism will be different \nfor each case. The following levels can be identi fi ed:\n\n   Lowest-level trade-offs, concerning speci fi c issues of detailed design such as the \u2022 \nuse or not of a special kind of solar cell. The corresponding technical specialists \nusually perform these trade-offs.  \n  Medium-level engineering trade-offs, which drive many lower-level design \u2022 \ndecisions. For instance, the choice of orbit altitude    or selection of satellite\u2019s \ncon fi guration. The supplier    and customer    architectural de fi nition teams perform \nthese trade-offs, always maintaining a generalist perspective.  \n  Highest-level trade-offs to select the optimal mission architecture that use end-to-end \u2022 \nmission effectiveness  fi gures   , and that incorporate parallel assessments of cost    and \nrisk   . These trade-offs are also performed by the supplier    and customer    architec-\ntural de fi nition teams, but the consumer    must be kept informed and involved in \nhelping to de fi ne end-to-end mission effectiveness algorithms, for example, and in \ncontributing to the selection of the most promising alternatives.    \n\n According to the different types of trade-offs, there are different procedures:\n\n   Direct reasoned selection between compared alternatives  \u2022 \n  The Analytical Hierarchy Process    (AHP) or the more complicated but powerful \u2022 \nMulti-Attribute Utility Theory    (MAUT)  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\n\n\n111System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\n  The use of fully numerical approaches based on mission effectiveness    metrics as \u2022 \ndescribed in the numbered list (1\u20139) at the beginning of this section  \n  Heuristic processes    and insight that is commonly related to past experiences    \u2022 \n\n The methods related to the  fi rst two bullets are going to be discussed in the \nfollowing paragraphs. Mission effectiveness will be discussed in Sections  5.6.1  and \n 5.6.2  and heuristic processes    and insight in Section  5.7 .  \n\n Direct comparison (Figure  5.5 ) is adequate for selecting between well-determined \nalternatives on issues of detailed design. The  fi gure below provides an example of a \ntrade-off between different alternatives for radio-frequency power generation. The \ntrade subject in the example is to determine the best source of radio-frequency power \ngeneration for an active microwave instrument    (Section   8.2.4    ). The  fi gure also estab-\nlishes a set of reasonable trade alternatives and trade criteria. The trade options are \ndiscussed and compared from the viewpoint of the trade criteria, using mainly or \nexclusively qualitative reasoning for the selection. In areas of detailed design such as \nthis, the opinion of a single, experienced person is enough to decide upon an optimal \nsolution. If the person happens to be the designer assigned to design and implement \nthe component under review, then his opinion should be given special weight since \nhe is ultimately responsible for the item\u2019s delivery and should enjoy the  fi nal say on \nan issue for which he is accountable. \n\nNo\n\nIdentify requirements\nand constraints\n\nPerform functional\nanalysis\n\nYes \n\nContinue the design \n\nAnalytical portion of trade studies\n\nDefine measurement\nmethods for:\nSystem effectiveness\nTechnical attributes\nCosts\n\nMake\ntentative\nselection\n\nIs tentative\nselection\n\nacceptable \n\nDefine\nselection\n\nrules\n\nDefine\nplausible\n\nalternatives\n\nCollect data\non each\n\nalternatives\nto support\nevaluation\n\nCompute an estimate system effectiveness,\ntechnical attributes and costs for each alternative\nEstimate uncertainty ranges\nPerform sensitivity analysis \n\n  Figure 5.4.

AHP is normally \nperformed in six steps:\n\n    1.    Create a set of evaluation objectives: mass, technical risk, science-return, and \nmany others.  \n\n    2.    Determine the relative importance of the objectives by pair-wise comparisons \nbetween them.  \n\n    3.    Establish a series of weights for the different objectives; highest for the most \nimportant evaluation objective, to the lowest for the least important.  \n\n    4.    Instruct evaluators to make separate pair-wise comparisons of the alternatives with \nrespect to each evaluation attribute.  \n\n    5.    Produce a ranking for each alternative by addition of the evaluation marks multi-\nplied by the weights allocated to each evaluation criteria.  \n\n    6.    Discuss the result with the evaluators and iterate the process to arrive at a consensus \nranking.     \n\n This method can be used for all types of design decisions. \n MAUT uses utility theory to create a mathematical model by quantifying the desir-\n\nability of the alternatives under consideration. It is necessary for scenarios where\u2014\nunlike AHP above \u2013 a numerical treatment of uncertainty or risk is necessary. The end \nresult is a function, which represents the preferences of the evaluators with respect \nto a number of design attributes. The function creation is based on mathematical \naxioms regarding the way individuals will behave when confronted with uncertainty. \nIt is based on establishing the evaluators\u2019 preferences by determining their level of \n\nTrade-off criteria: \n\nImpact on instrument performance\nMaturity of technology\nCost\nImpact on instrument mode \n\nTrade-off subject:\nRadio-frequency\npower generation\n\nDistributed T-R\nmodules \n\nHigh power TWT\namplifiers \n\nDistributed medium\npower TWT amplifiers \n\nKlystron amplifiers \n\n  Figure 5.5.

This will allow \ncombining them using weighting factors to be agreed. This will create a multiattribute \nutility function. The alternative to be selected shall be the alternative providing the \nhighest multiattribute utility value. \n\n Independently of the trade-off    mechanisms, selection rules for determining the \noptimal outcome must be established. The criteria are numerous and will vary accord-\ning to whether qualitative or quantitative effectiveness or ranking values are applied \nto the different alternatives. When there is a lack of numerical values for mission \neffectiveness   , it is possible to create a relative ranking by employing the AHP or \nMAUT procedures described above, after which a selection can be made of the \nhighest-ranked alternative or the best alternative that ful fi lls some supplementary \nconstraint   , such as being below a given cost boundary or above a particular numerical \nquality performance that is considered compulsory.  \n\n    5.5.4.   Budget allocation engineering \n\n The speci fi cation will include many high-level numerical requirements that apply to \nthe space system or to the satellite; for example, the total mass of the satellite, the \naccuracy of data recovered by the instruments, or the actual pointing    of the instru-\nments carried by the satellite. The actual performances of the system with respect to \neach one of these high-level numerical requirements are a function of many factors \ndistributed throughout the system, for example:\n\n   The overall mass of the satellite will be a function of the mass of each component \u2022 \nit carries.  \n  The instrument\u2019s accuracy will depend on factors such as aperture size, detector \u2022 \nquality, thermal control ef fi ciency, the calibration    approach, the quality of on-\nground processing to eliminate spurious signals, the use of external validation    data \nfor comparison, etc.  \n  Knowledge about the pointing    of the instruments will depend on the mechanical \u2022 \nand thermal stability    of the instruments and satellite structure, the satellite\u2019s atti-\ntude determination    and control, and the end-to-end system\u2019s capability, or lack \nthereof, to use on-ground processing to determine the actual pointing by compar-\ning the  fi gures provided by the satellite with well-characterized references over the \nEarth    or celestial sphere   .  \n  The total number of images produced by an optical Earth    observation    mission will \u2022 \ndepend on factors such as the presence of adequate solar illumination, the absence \nof clouds, the time necessary for pointing    and repointing the instruments, the time \nneeded for calibration   , the time needed to ensure that the satellite pointing direc-\ntion is stable enough for proper image acquisition, and many others.    \n\n\n\n114 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n In each case it would be necessary to determine how many lower-level sources can \naffect the higher-level numerical performance, and once that all the causes are \nidenti fi ed, it is necessary to apportion the overall high-level numerical performance \nbetween all the relevant contributors. In this way the single high-level  fi gure will \nderive a multiplicity of low-level numerical requirements   , one for each contributing \ncause.  This apportioning process is called budget allocation      and it is one of the \nmost powerful tools to optimize and to drive the system design process     ,  because \ndifferent apportioning will allocate different values to different sources and this will \nmake easy, dif fi cult, or just impossible different design alternatives .  For example, the \nchosen allocation of mass  fi gures for the structural or thermal subsystems of the satel-\nlite will make possible or impossible speci fi c structural or thermal concepts, it will \ndetermine the risk    and cost    associated with their implementation and delivery, and it \nwill be possible to make harder the ful fi llment of one or the other subsystem    by just \nchanging the allocated  fi gures. Budget allocation is a very powerful tool, not only to \ndrive the design but also to drive the level of risk and cost associated to all the lower-\nlevel components involved in the particular high-level budget. Relationship between \nbudget allocation and design has already been depicted in Figure  5.2 . The budget \nallocation is fundamentally a process to establish requirements; that means, it is a \nresponsibility of the customer   . \n\n A possible heuristic maxim on budget apportioning    would be:  to allocate as much \nof the budget as necessary to each error source      in order to balance the resources \navailable for ful fi lling the requirement with the dif fi culty involved in its \nful fi llment . This means that the implementation dif fi culties of all suppliers must be \nbalanced. A fair allocation of resources that is fair for each and every supplier    will be \nalso optimal for the system as a whole; that is, it will produce the speci fi ed highest-\nlevel performances while reducing overall cost    and risk   . It is the duty of the customer    \nto identify if the allocation of requirements    is unfair for a given supplier.  The space \nagency shall be proactive to avoid the prime industrial contractor allocating \nbudgets      in a way that is detrimental to some subcontractor because an unfair \nallocation will be  fi nally detrimental for the whole project . \n\n Another aspect to bear in mind concerning the relationship between budget alloca-\ntion    and design is that all budget allocation is undertaken with some design in mind, \nalbeit preliminary. For instance, the allocation of the overall mass budget of a satellite \nis simultaneously top-down    and bottom-up   , entailing a preliminary top-down allocation \nbased on previous experience, followed by bottom-up estimations once mass estimates \nderived from actual component designs start becoming available. As a consequence of \nthis interrelation between design and budget allocation, any major change in the satel-\nlite concept (a change in satellite con fi guration, for example) will require changes in \nbudget allocations to the different subsystems of the satellite. \n\n Budget engineering must always include the ability to accurately calculate the \neffects of lower-level design decisions on the higher-level requirements   . This abil-\nity to calculate upward is crucial for establishing the entire system\u2019s actual perfor-\nmance once the performances of all the contributing causes have been determined. \nThis means that there is a descending path for correct budget apportioning and an \nascending one for overall performance evaluation. The ability to control both paths \nshould be maintained at all levels of system decomposition   , from the most general \nto the most detailed. This is a supplementary example of the principle that during \n\n\n\n115System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\nthe de fi nition phases design and speci fi cation interact until they reach a common \naccommodation. \n\n Different error budgets    will have different error decomposition and summation \nrules. The simplest rule is that of direct addition; for example, the mass of a satellite \nis the direct sum of the masses of all its individual components. \n\n Many error sources are probabilistic   . In that case the addition rules for different \nerror sources will be derived from the combination of the mathematical expectations    \nof these error sources. Expectation is de fi ned as the integrated product of the probability \nof an outcome multiplied by the value of that outcome. In the case of uncorrelated \nrandom errors (electronic noise, for instance), the errors will add \u201croot mean square.   \u201d \nIn this case two errors with a standard deviation (the square root of the expectation) of \n1 will combine to produce a total error with a standard deviation of 1.41. \n\n In some cases, determining the correct apportioning requires the performance of \nspeci fi c or complex analysis. For example, if an instrument can only produce images \nof the ground when there are no clouds and when the Sun    is located high on the \nhorizon, it would be necessary to determine the cloud provability for the time of day \nwhen the Sun is high enough to snap the image. An especially complex case of error \napportioning is the allocation of overall pointing    requirements for the satellite. This \nwill be analyzed in Section   9.8.2    .  \n\n    5.5.5.   Concurrent engineering \n\n Concurrent engineering    de fi nes a space system with the help of multidisciplinary \nteams composed of all the relevant technical experts, who interact both directly and \nsimultaneously. This simultaneous interaction permits the evaluation of the down-\nstream and upstream implications of any design decision, and facilitates rapid \nveri fi cation of its feasibility and adequacy, not just from the viewpoint of the engi-\nneering specialty that made the design decision, but from the perspective of its impli-\ncations for other engineering domains as well. Concurrent engineering generally \nrequires the use of an automated data-exchange environment so the different techni-\ncal experts can communicate with one another; but the essence of the approach is \ndirect communication, allowing experts to freely discuss the implications of each \ndesign option. Concurrent engineering not only involves engineers specializing in \nareas such as satellite thermal control or data handling, but also specialists in areas of \nengineering support such as reliability or cost estimation   . Furthermore, the best use \nof concurrent engineering requires the involvement of experts on observational tech-\nniques to be used and on the instruments to be carried by the satellite. All space mis-\nsions are designed around the instruments, and the availability of speci fi c instrument \nexperts is crucial for the optimal accommodation of the instruments with regard to the \nrest of the satellite and the mission as a whole. The presence of consumers    is gener-\nally not required as part of the process of concurrent engineering. However, their \npresence, at least at key moments, will allow a better understanding of the dif fi culties \nimplementing designs that satisfy the requested requirements. Their presence could \nprompt the rephrasing or relaxing of some requirements, making them easier to ful fi ll \nwhile maintaining perfectly acceptable performances for the mission. \n\n The essence of concurrent engineering lies in the swift transmission of information \namong all those involved in the mission\u2019s de fi nition, allowing each one to understand \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n116 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nthe issues faced by all the others. This is another example of the observation made at \nthe end of Section  5.3.1  that one of the few things capable of reducing both cost    and \nrisk    simultaneously is the easy  fl ow of information during a mission\u2019s architectural \nde fi nition phases   . This is one of those truly rare occasions when \u201cfaster-cheaper-better\u201d \ncan actually be realized.  \n\n    5.5.6.   Dependability \n\n Dependability is a general term embracing the system availability    and its three gov-\nerning factors: reliability, maintainability, and serviceability. Availability is de fi ned as \nthe ability of a system to perform its required function; the availability  fi gure is \nde fi ned as the system\u2019s total operating time divided by total time. Reliability is \nde fi ned as the numerical probability of failure occurrence. Serviceability is the capa-\nbility of acting on a system to prevent or correct failures. Satellites cannot be physi-\ncally maintained or serviced in situ, but ground segments can perform scheduled \nmaintenance tasks, software    updating, for instance, or service tasks such as correcting \nrecoverable failures, activating redundant processes, or implementing work-around \nprocedures. This kind of servicing can make missions that have suffered apparently \nunsolvable problems operable again. \n\n The de fi nition of numerical  fi gures for acceptable levels of availability    and reli-\nability is part of the overall task of system speci fi cation, which is the responsibility \nof the customer   . \n\n    5.5.6.1.   Numerical reliability calculations \n Reliability has been de fi ned as the numerical probability of something unpleasant \noccurring. The relative frequency with which particular events occur is indicated by \na probability distribution, which de fi nes the failure rate. If the failure rate were con-\nstant and if failure occurred randomly, which are reasonable assumptions and widely \nemployed, then reliability would be a negative exponential function curve that \ndecreases with time (Figure  5.6 ).  \n\n Numerical analysis for the evaluation of availability    and reliability is well estab-\nlished. These methods are based on adjudicating failure rate  fi gures to components. \nThis adjudication of  fi gures works quite well with electrical and electronic components \nthat are used in large numbers \u2013 so the analysis is statistically representative \u2013 and \noperating in well-characterized environments. Nevertheless, this approach is only \nmoderately successful for dealing with the real-life behavior of mechanical compo-\nnents used in small numbers and in widely different environments. Furthermore, it \ncannot deal with events like design or assembly mistakes, or errors of operation. This \ndemonstrates that in order to design a properly functioning space system its reliability \nmust be studied, but that it is unwise to focus exclusively on its reliability  fi gures. \n Reliability  fi gures are meaningful but they cannot be taken literally.  Experience \nhas demonstrated that well-built satellites last much longer than reliability  fi gures \nappear to indicate. Examples about that will be provided at the end of this section. \n\n Reliability  fi gures can be improved by:\n\n   Using high-quality/high-price space-quali fi ed components  \u2022 \n  Using redundant \u201cduplicate\u201d components that can take over if one member of the \u2022 \nset malfunctions  \n\n\n\n117System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\n  Protecting electronic components from radiation by shielding them with metal  \u2022 \n  De-rating, or the use of high-capacity components to perform low-capacity func-\u2022 \ntions; the lower stress of use will increase the component\u2019s reliability with respect \nits nominal usage    \n\n An extreme case of redundancy is to double the number of satellites. In the early \nyears of the space age NASA frequently launched more than one satellite with the \ndeclared intention to ensuring that at least one was functioning properly. NASA\u2019s \n1975 Viking mission to Mars    employed two satellites with this idea in mind, but it \nturned out that both worked  fl awlessly. This approach is still extensively used for \noperational missions    with demanding availability requirements, for example, meteo-\nrological missions or GPS    constellation. \n\n As mentioned above, reliability analysis works poorly outside the sphere of elec-\ntronics    and does not re fl ect how satellites function in real life. Nonetheless, numerical \nreliability analysis is an absolutely necessary tool for proper system de fi nition, \nthough the results are better understood when interpreted as more comparative and \nqualitative than as literal and quantitative. Reliability analysis is compulsory to com-\npare alternative implementations, to balance the reliability  fi gures of each satellite\u2019s \ndistinct parts, and to achieve reasonable levels of redundancy for the different parts \nof a satellite or system.  \n\n    5.5.6.2.   Redundancy \n Redundancy is provided by the availability in the satellite of two or more identical \nitems able to ful fi ll the same functions. If one assembly fails the satellite will use a \nredundant assembly to continue operating.  Redundancy protects against uncorrelated \nrandom failures. Redundancy does not protect against an underlying common \ncause, unknowns, or mistakes . In 1982,  fl ying over Indonesia, a commercial aircraft \n\n  Figure 5.6.    Reliability Reduction with Time for One Satellite with a Speci fi ed Reliability of \n0.75 After 7 Years of Operation.       \n\n \n\n\n\n118 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nlost its four jet engines all at once. From a classical \u2013 uncorrelated failure \u2013 reliability \npoint of view that would have been absolutely impossible; nevertheless, the underly-\ning cause was that the satellite was  fl ying through a cloud of volcanic dust dense \nenough to extinguish the combustion in the four engines. The fourfold failure was due \nto an unforeseen underlying common cause. \n\n So far the discussion has centered on \u201cnormal\u201d redundancy, which increases the \ndependability of a system by duplicating identical components. Functional redun-\ndancy    is an alternative approach in which the system responds to component failures \nnot by switching to the still-functioning duplicate component, but by operational \nwork-around and the use of components in ways that were not originally intended. \nThe main communication antenna of NASA\u2019s Galileo    mission to Jupiter    failed to \ndeploy, and a work-around was accomplished by software     fi xes that further com-\npressed the science data and images. The compressed images were then returned \nthrough the low-gain antenna, although at a severely reduced data rate due to the low-\ngain antenna\u2019s performances limitations. This work-around greatly reduced the data \nthroughput    and the number of images the mission was able to produce, but trans-\nformed a potentially total failure into a fairly successful mission. Adequate safety \nmargins    combined with ingenuity have saved more than one mission that might have \nended prematurely in total failure.  \n\n    5.5.6.3.   Heuristics \n The above discussion has already provided heuristic maxims, like: \u201c Reliability \n fi gures do not work well with mechanical components \u201d or \u201c Reliability  fi gures are \nmeaningful but they cannot be taken literally.\u201d  It is a generally accepted space \nsystems design heuristic rule that  satellites shall avoid having single-point failures  \nthat result in the system\u2019s complete failure. But the concept of single-point failure also \ndoes not apply well to the area of mechanical design; to the point where it can be said \n\u201c Every satellite will have mechanical characteristics that can become single-point \nfailures.\u201d  The best way to provide highly reliable mechanical design is to have a good \nunderstanding of the satellite\u2019s environment, of proper design analysis and testing, and \nthe use of robust design and safety margins    to provide supplementary con fi dence. \n\n Unknown environments are especially hazardous with respect to classical \u201credun-\ndancy\u201d approaches for ensuring system availability    because such an environment is \nperilous for both nominal and redundant functional paths.  Redundancy does not \nprotect against unknown environments . \n\n Another way to provide improved reliability is by implementing functional redun-\ndancy or implementing the system using several satellites, allowing for a progressive \n\u201cgentle\u201d degradation if individual satellites were to fail.  Satellite constellations pro-\nvide good availability     because the functions they provide remain available (albeit \nwith reduced performance) even after the complete failure of one or more elements \nof the constellation. The use of a constellation of multiple satellites is common in \noperational missions    that \u2013 being necessary to ful fi ll routinely important social needs \n\u2013 require the highest level of availability.  \n\n    5.5.6.4.   Mission life and reliability \n A mission life    reference duration that can be used as a guideline for the mission\u2019s design \nmust be established. Reliability  fi gures decrease with time, but beyond reliability, \n\n\n\n119System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\nmission life is also relevant to the design of items with a limited life; the amount of \nfuel needed to perform orbit maintenance   , for example, or the progressive degrada-\ntion in the ef fi ciency of solar cells    affecting the satellite\u2019s power capacity. These \nfactors also limit the satellite\u2019s operational life   . Figure  5.6  presented reliability as a \nfunction of mission life. This  fi gure employs typical space system design values, and \ndue to the increasingly downward tangent of the negative exponential reliability \ncurve, it would be unlikely for a satellite to survive much beyond the speci fi ed time. \nIn real life, on the other hand, well-designed and well-built satellites survive longer \nthan speci fi ed and predicted by reliability calculations. The examples are many:\n\n   ESA\u2019s COS-B mission was designed for 1 year of life with 2 years of consum-\u2022 \nables, but lasted 7 years, until all its consumables were used up.  \n  IUE   , launched in 1978 with a design life of 3 years, lasted an incredible \u2022 \n18.6 years.  \n  The OTS communications satellite was designed to last 3 years, but its transpon-\u2022 \nders continued working for 12 years.  \n  Soho    had a designed life of 3 years and still operates 14 years later.    \u2022 \n\n A good idea of the difference between predicted and actual satellite life is provided \nby the in-orbit performance of the Meteosat series of operational meteorology    \nsatellites:  \n\n Satellite  Launch  End \n\n 1  11/77  11/79 (imager failure) \n\n 2  6/81  11/91 \n\n 3  6/88  11/95 \n\n 4  3/89  11/95 (imager failure) \n\n 5  3/91  Still in service in 2005 \n\n 6  11/93  Still in service in 2005 \n\n 7  9/97  Still in service in 2005 \n\n Meteosat 1, 2, and 3 satellites were designed for 3 years of life, while satellites 4, \n5, 6, and 7 were designed to last 5 years, using conventional reliability calculations. \nThe actual lifespan of all the satellites but the  fi rst was consistently longer than their \ncalculated values. It is evident that conventional reliability calculations underestimate \nthe lifespan of well-designed and built satellites. This is due to the existence of both \nexplicit and hidden safety margins   . The impact of safety margins will be discussed in \nSection  5.6.3  below.    \n\n    5.6.   Design and mission performances \n\n Space systems engineering texts provide a useful simpli fi ed view of the multidimen-\nsional design space    that is normally compressed to a cost versus performance curve    \nas depicted in Figure  5.7  below. A system providing no performance will still have \n\n\n\n120 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nsome cost. Starting from that point the system performances will increase fast for \nsmall increases in cost, and as the design moves to higher and higher performances, \nthe cost increases associated with each performance improvement will be larger and \nlarger because the technology needed to implement the system will become more and \nmore sophisticated. The shaded area represents a probabilistic    performance inherent \nto the design. There is an intermediate most likely performance curve framed by \nupper/optimistic and lower/pessimistic limits, which provide an indication related to \na given set of probabilities of performance   . The most likely curve is not centered \nbecause outcomes with a performance much higher than the \u201cmost likely\u201d are less \nprobable than outcomes with a performance much lower than it. That means the \nperformance probability distribution is asymmetric. Costs larger than the most \nlikely are very likely but performances better than the most likely are rare. In the \nother hand, designs always include safety margins   . These safety margins will \nensure that the \u201cmost likely\u201d performance is larger \u2013 sometimes much larger \u2013 than \nthe speci fi ed performance as stated in the formal speci fi cation of the mission. This \nwill be discussed in detail in Section  5.6.3 . As indicated in Figure  5.7  there are \nmultiple possible design points: \n\n   In the majority of cases, the aim is to provide the least expensive design that is \u2022 \ngood enough to satisfy all the requirements   . This is designing to the speci fi ed \nperformances   , an approach that entails cost risks.  \n  When there is some leeway on performances and cost   , the ideal is clearly the \u2022 \nsystem that provides the best relation between them: the optimal performance per \nunit cost   .  \n  When the cost is absolutely  fi rm \u201cdesigning to cost   \u201d will provide the best possible \u2022 \nperformance within the given cost constraint   . Design to cost entails performance \nrisk   .  \n\nPerformances \n\nCost\n\nCost risk \n\nNominal\nOptimal\n\nDesign to performances \n\nDesign\nto cost \n\nBest outcome curve Most\nlikely\noutcome\ncurve\n\nP\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\nde\nns\n\nity\n \n\nPerformance \n\nP\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\nde\nns\n\nity\n \n\nCost \n\nPerformance risk \nWorst outcome curve \n\n  Figure 5.7.    Performance Versus Cost    Curve and Possible Design Strategies.       \n\n \n\n\n\n121System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\n  In extreme cases it is advisable to aim for the lowest possible cost    that would still \u2022 \nproduce a meaningful mission \u2013 meaningful for those with the authority to approve \nthe project. This might be the case for technology demonstration missions.    \n\n Performances and cost    are probabilistic   , not deterministic   . Quantifying these \nuncertainties involves producing performance and cost probability density functions. \nNevertheless, it must not be believed that the curve above represents a solid mathe-\nmatical reality, as would a probabilistic analysis of pointing    errors or random accel-\neration. Space system performance    is not a linear one-dimensional parameter and cost \nand risk will depend on many factors, which will be dif fi cult to analyze with rigorous \nmathematics alone. Disraeli is quoted as saying. \u201cSober people use lampposts for \nillumination and drunks use them for support.\u201d  Complex numerical calculations are \nexcellent ways to gain insight and provide illumination with regard to design \nalternatives but mathematics alone cannot be used to decide the optimal design \nselection . The limitations of numerical effectiveness parameters will be discussed in \ndetail in Section  5.6.2 . \n\n    5.6.1.   Mission effectiveness metrics \n\n Section   3.4.2     introduced mission effectiveness    metrics. The present section will \nexpand on mission effectiveness and their use as tools for design optimization. \nFigure  5.8  summarizes the most common mission effectiveness parameters.  \n\n As indicated in item 3 of the numbered list at the beginning of Section  5.5.3 , when \ncomparing alternative designs, ideally there would be a single mission effectiveness    \nparameter providing an integrated estimate of the mission\u2019s  fi nal value for the con-\nsumer   . Figure  5.7  of the present chapter implicitly assumes that this is possible. In that \ncase, it would also become possible to perform all nine steps of the numbered list of \nSection  5.5.3 , and the design trade-off    would become purely numerical. \n\n As said in Sections   3.2.1     and   3.4.2    , the fundamental needs of the consumers    and \nthe corresponding System Effectiveness Metrics will be in terms of:\n\n   What to deliver? Those are the parameters of the \u201cOutput Quality\u201d column of \u2022 \nFigure  5.8 .  \n  How much to deliver? Those are the parameters of the columns \u201cOutput Quantity\u201d \u2022 \nand \u201cLife\u201d of Figure  5.8   \n  How to deliver? Those are the parameters of the columns \u201cAvailability\u201d and \u2022 \n\u201cResponsiveness\u201d of Figure  5.8     \n\n It is always possible to assign \u2013 in consultancy with the consumer    \u2013 numerical \nweights to the different numerical effectiveness parameters listed in Figure  5.8 . This \nwould provide a truly integrated, transparent, and mutually agreed-upon overall value \nof system effectiveness that would allow mission designers to de fi ne the optimal sys-\ntem design, as implied by Figure  5.7 . It is also possible to use qualitative or relative \neffectiveness metrics that would provide a ranking of the alternatives under consider-\nation, though relative ranking cannot be used to compare different alternatives from \nthe perspective of mission effectiveness    per unit of cost   . In real life, the limitations of \nnumerical approaches to overall mission effectiveness are severe. The next section will \nanalyze these limitations.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\n\n\n122 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    5.6.2.   Effectiveness metrics limitations \n\n Optimal designs require the use of models that permit quantifying measures of effec-\ntiveness and cost. Models have their limitations, however, and obtaining good  fi gures \nof overall system effectiveness is often dif fi cult. Practical effectiveness models only \nfeature some of the many possible key requirements of special importance to the \nconsumer   . Models supporting the different steps necessary to providing a true system-\nlevel effectiveness  fi gure may not have been properly integrated. Furthermore, true \nperformance scales are not linear. Even if we focus on the easiest and most quanti fi able \nparameters, for example, image resolution, doubling the resolution does not imply \ndoubling the usefulness of the mission for the consumers   . Sometimes a small increase \nin performances produces a very large increase in mission effectiveness    because the \nsmall increase reveals a totally new set of observables   , opening up new areas of \napplication and research to the consumers. \n\n Figure  5.8  presented different types of mission effectiveness metrics. Some of \nthese types of metrics are numerical and can be obtained using algorithms based on \nphysical and mathematical laws. The weakest astronomical signal that an orbiting \ntelescope    is able to detect, the time the telescope needs to complete a comprehensive \nsurvey of the heavens, or the time required for the telescope to react to a speci fi c \nobservation request are all unambiguous and objective numerical values. Nevertheless \nthe dependency of the mission effectiveness on these parameters is not linear. A tele-\nscope not sensitive enough to detect the events of interest to the consumers    will \nbe insuf fi cient even if its sensitivity is quite close but still below the required one. \nA system intended to survey the entire sky will not provide 90 % satisfaction if it only \nsurveys 90 % of the sky. It can, however, still produce good science, and consumers \nwould prefer it to no mission at all. Establishing sets of values for threshold, break-\n\nOutput Quality ResponsivenessOutput Quantity AvailabilityLife\n\nSpatial Resolution\n\nSpectral Resolution\n\nSignal Stability\n\nSignal Resolution\n\nSignal  Accuracy\n\nCoverage\n\nRevisit\n\nRequest to \ndelivery delay\n\nAcquisition to \ndelivery delay\n\nReliability\n\nOutages\n\nMission Effectiveness\n\nWhat?

The Parameters Are Divided in \n \u201c What\u201d  \u201c How\u201d and  \u201c How Much\u201d Categories.       \n\n \n\n\n\n123System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\nthrough, and target criteria, as discussed in Section   3.2.2    , can diminish the problem, \nbut the existence of real discontinuities affecting consumer    satisfaction makes it clear \nthat a nice, monotonically increasing performance curve, as depicted in Figure  5.6 , is \nalways a simpli fi cation of reality. \n\n Models always include assumptions about the real world and they always leave \nsomething out. They are only able to produce accurate results when addressing \nquanti fi able parameters in which the mathematical methods used for the derivation \nof the  fi gures is well understood, and that is not normally the case when dealing with \nthe highest-level system de fi nition issues. There is a signi fi cant difference between the \nreally important questions in cost-effectiveness    discussions and the questions that \ncan be truly treatable from a mathematical model perspective. That being the case, \nthe model will produce insights but will not be able to provide de fi nitive answers to \nthe most important questions on its own. On the other hand, numerical models that \n\u201conly\u201d provide insights are far from useless; indeed the resulting insights are fun-\ndamental tools for system de fi nition, and system designers must interpret model \nresults and convey their interpretations to the consumer    and sponsor    in a way that \ncaptures the essence of the real problem to be answered: identifying the best way \nfor consumers    to obtain what they want while satisfying the limitations established \nby the sponsor. \n\n Unlike overall mission performance   , overall mission cost is an unambiguous \nparameter and the best estimation of how much the future system is going to cost \nconveys a clear and powerful message. Nevertheless, cost estimations are notoriously \nunreliable. Bottom-up (Section   4.8.2    ) cost estimations depend on the judgments of \nthe expert providing the  fi gure; that is, they are subjective calculations in fl uenced by \nthe expert\u2019s degree of optimism. Establishing a bottom-up    cost estimation    is a long \nand complex process that requires ample time and a detailed breakdown of the job, \nwith its associated well-de fi ned design. Missions are approved well before the \nsystem\u2019s de fi nition is detailed enough to allow an item-by-item bottom-up estimation \nof costs. Bottom-up price models also lack the  fl exibility required for estimating \nwidely different alternative concepts or distinct options within a given concept. The \n fl exibility provided by top-down    cost estimations (Section   4.8.1    ) makes them far \nmore useful for determining an optimal design. Even so, a top-down    cost model is \nnever more than an observed correlation between cost and mass. Therefore, to pro-\nvide credible cost estimations the top-down model shall be based upon cost data of \nolder systems reasonably similar to the new one. The similitude shall be not only \ntechnical but also programmatic. The cost of a radically new system or being devel-\noped in a radically new programmatic framework    is very dif fi cult to predict with \ntop-down models. \n\n System dif fi culty or complexity is another subjective parameter, correlation does \nnot equal causation, and the past is frequently a poor guide to the future. As in the \ncase of numerical system effectiveness metrics, the top-down    cost model only pro-\nvides an insight into future costs, but as with the former, the insight is valuable in \nitself, and the cost  fi gures thus derived are the best tool for comparing alternative \ndesigns. \n\n We can conclude therefore, that  providing numerical values for overall system \neffectiveness should be considered as a support for sound reasoning, not as a \nsubstitute for it .  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n124 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    5.6.3.   Safety margins, mistakes, and errors \n\n Among all the factors in fl uencing the process of space mission de fi nition, there are \ntwo that greatly in fl uence the real-life performance of space systems, albeit in oppo-\nsite ways: safety margins    and design errors. \n\n Any system needs to ful fi ll the consumers   \u2019 requirements in a consistent way, \nwithin a particular environment and during a speci fi ed period and with an extremely \nhigh level of con fi dence. To accomplish all this, engineers use safety margins   . For \nexample, any thermal design    includes explicit numerical temperature values that are \nadded as margins to the worst temperature range that the design will actually face. \nThese margins will ensure that the resulting design will be able to cope with a broader \ntemperature range than the worst range expected during the life of the system. \nMargins are used in every area of design, and engineering is thoroughly steeped in a \nphilosophy of prudence. All systems possess not only explicit safety margins \nemployed as part of the design process   , but hidden ones as well. On the other hand, \ndue to this hidden safety margin, an average low Earth    orbiting satellite\u2019s thermal \ncontrol subsystem    will perform better over time than predicted by the relevant calcu-\nlations. For perfectly known conditions, safety margins can be greatly reduced; but \nspace engineering is a  fi eld in which elements of novelty are common, and where the \nconditions that the satellite must withstand are seldom perfectly known. Both explicit \nand hidden safety margins provide robustness to space systems, enabling them to \nsurvive and operate correctly when confronted with unexpected situations or condi-\ntions. Coping with the unexpected is the norm in space missions whose aim is \nopening new domains for science. The designer must expect the unexpected, and \ncomfortable safety margins offer the best tool for doing so. \n\n A by-product of safety margins    is that the most probable performance    of a well-\nimplemented system will be superior, often far superior, to the performance requested \nby the formal speci fi cation (Figure  5.9 ). Section   3.2     de fi ned speci fi cations    as legally \nbinding    documents delimiting the minimum performance parameters to be ful fi lled in \norder for the customer    to accept and pay for the work undertaken. The contractual \nrelationship between the customer and supplier    centers on the speci fi ed value, but the \nestimation of the mission\u2019s performances must include a probabilistic    evaluation of \nthe performance, differentiating between most probable performances    and guaranteed \nperformances   . The consumer    shall be informed of both so that he acquires a real \nunderstanding of what is likely to occur. ESA\u2019s ISO    mission (Section   7.2    ) studied the \ncold universe and required cooling    the instrument with liquid helium. The liquid \ncooled the instrument through evaporation and was lost to space so that the mission \nended when all the liquid Helium    was used up. The satellite carried enough liquid \nHelium to guarantee a speci fi ed mission life    of 18 months, but in the event, the Helium \nand the mission lasted 28 months. These valuable 10 additional months were the \nresult of ample safety margins and conservative analytical methods. It is logical to \nmake the consumer aware not only of the guarantied speci fi ed performance but also \nof the \u2013 better \u2013 most probable one.

Numerically explicit \nsafety margins    can be used to produce probabilistic    distributions of performances that \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n125System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\ntake them into account. Hidden safety margins, on the other hand, are not explicitly \nstated anywhere and cannot be easily treated numerically, even though they are \nabsolutely real. \n\n Space mission de fi nition and implementation are complex processes and human \nerror is almost inevitable. Space research opens new paths to knowledge, and it is not \nsurprising that space systems encounter situations and conditions that were unfore-\nseen during the design phase. Errors and unknowns have the opposite effects from \nthose of safety margins   . Noncatastrophic errors or unknowns will move the entire \ndensity function downward and will also raise the probability of poor performance. \nLarge errors \u2013 large enough to result in mission failure \u2013 will provide a mission \nperformance of zero. In order to take into account this quite credible total failure prob-\nability, the real probability density function will have a secondary peak on zero \nperformance. This means that real-life performance density functions are bimodal. \nThey have a peak near the expected most likely average and another near zero perfor-\nmance. The second peak must be high enough to represent the  fi nite probability of \nhaving zero performance. \n\n Ulysses    (Section   8.3.5    ) is a good example of mistakes, errors, and safety margins    \ncompensating for each other to  fi nally produce a successful mission. Ulysses \ndeployed a 7 m long boom to study magnetic  fi elds and electrical waves around the \nSun   . Just after launch the Sun heated the boom, pumping energy onto it, and making \nit oscillate. This was completely unexpected. The boom displayed a nonlineal    stiff-\nness    behavior \u2013 it was very stiff against high forces but less stiff against low forces \u2013 \nand this had not been properly tested or analyzed, which was a mistake.

The boom was  fi nally able to \nwithstand the oscillations originated by the Sun, and as the satellite\u2019s attitude con-\ntrol    was also overdesigned, it was able to eliminate these oscillations as soon as the \nsatellite\u2019s orbit moved it away from Earth   , thus decreasing the Sun\u2019s intensity, a \nfew days after the beginning of the mission. Just after the phenomena was discov-\nered, it was possible to study in detail the true behavior of the boom under the Sun\u2019s \nin fl uence and controlled by the satellite\u2019s attitude control system. It was concluded \nthat the behavior of the boom, as excited by the Sun-boom geometry and controlled \nby the satellite\u2019s attitude control system, was such that the oscillations would not \noccur again during the duration of the mission. This turned out to be true, and \nUlysses and its boom functioned  fl awlessly for more than 19 years until the mission \n fi nally ended.   \n\n    5.7.   Nonnumerical support to decision making \n\n All the design and programmatic decisions imply risk. To reduce this risk the deci-\nsions shall be supported by nonnumerical and numerical rational and scienti fi c pro-\ncedures. This section provides a summary on nonnumerical procedures that have \nbeen discussed several times in the previous sections. This section will provide a \nsummary on nonnumerical procedures and the next one will do the same for numeri-\ncal procedures. Space system engineering is rooted in science, and science is rooted \nin numbers. This chapter emphasized the importance of a nonnumerical \u201cmore art \nthan science\u201d perspective regarding design. Section  5.2  is based on nonnumerical \nreasoning. Heuristics, of course, provide rules of thumb and educated guesses that \nhelp in the process of space system de fi nition. Heuristics represent for strategies \nusing readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to control problem \nsolving in human beings and machines. Heuristics are obtained by trial and error; that \nis, they derive from the experience of the person formulating the heuristics   . Quite a \nnumber of heuristic maxims or tenets concerning mission de fi nition have been pro-\nvided in this chapter; they come from a variety of sources, and a few are original to \nthis text. Heuristics are especially valuable in situations where strict mathematical \nanalysis can be misleading, and during the earliest stages of a project because during \nthese early phases many important decisions must be made based on very little infor-\nmation. Programmatic constraints, which will ultimately be derived from political or \npolicy considerations, will also introduce unavoidable nonnumerical considerations \ninto the process of system de fi nition. The Apollo program only trained astronauts as \nMoon    geologists for the very last  fl ights, proving that the Apollo\u2019s primary aim was \nto demonstrate that it was possible for the USA to land on the Moon before the Soviet \nUnion, not to study the geology of the Moon. Political constraints are real and the \ndesigner shall design the system taking them into account. As said in Section  5.5.3  \nmany design decisions at all levels are taken performed by specialist after a purely \nrational nonnumerical approach. Direct reasoning    (Figure  5.5 ) and The Analytical \nHierarch Process    are nonnumerical procedures to help in the selection of optimal \ndesign alternatives.  \n\n\n\n127System Design as a Synchronic Process\n\n    5.8.   Numerical support to decision making \n\n Deterministic and probabilistic    numerical tools can be used to support decision \nmaking. \n\n    5.8.1.   Deterministic approaches \n\n In most situations it will be possible to model the behavior of a system using deter-\nministic    mathematical formulations. This will allow the derivation of numerical \nparameters that can be compared and used to select the best design alternative. \nHighest-level design decision must be made with the aid of numerical system effec-\ntiveness  fi gures. Figure  5.7  analyzed the concepts of mission performance and mis-\nsion cost and how they can be used to de fi ne different types of optimal alternatives. \nIt is possible to evaluate a telescope   \u2019s image quality as a function of the aperture, \nand it is also possible to use parametric cost estimates (Section   4.8.1    ) to derive the \ncost of a mission as a function of the aperture of the telescope as well. This provides \na performance versus cost function that permits comparing alternative mission \nconcepts. \n\n Specialists at all levels use numerical methods to compare alternative designs and \nto help select the one that best ful fi lls the multiple requirements of the mission. For \nexample, structural specialist will use  fi nite element analysis to compare alternative \nstructural concepts in order to  fi nd the lightest design compatible with speci fi ed \nstrength    or stiffness    levels or the strongest concept compatible with speci fi ed mass \nrequirements.  \n\n    5.8.2.   Nonprobabilistic numerical approaches in situation of uncertainty \n\n The outcome of strategies or decisions might actually come to fruition in an environ-\nment different than that originally predicted. The occurrence or nonoccurrence of \nfuture events could change what is considered to be the optimal strategy. \n\n The assignment of probabilities to possible future events is a dif fi cult task and in \nsome cases may be impossible. Nevertheless, it is still possible to take into account \nthe possible existence of these future events and compare their impact on the selec-\ntion of optimal strategies, even without making any assumptions about the relative \nprobability of these events. There are a number of criteria that can be applied to \nde fi ning different types of optimal strategies. \n\n The Laplace criterion proposes that when comparing the merits of several possible \ndecisions, the strategy with the best arithmetically determined average performance \nshall be chosen. This criterion assumes that all possible futures are equally probable, \nthat a straight average provides a true measure of value, and that the strategy with the \noptimal value shall be chosen. \n\n Section   4.9     provided an analysis of risk and Section  5.3.2  analyzes design and risk. \nSpace projects are expensive and unique and space engineering is risk averse. A con-\nservative \u201cmaximin\u201d strategy recommends selecting the decision with the maximum \u2013 \nthe least bad \u2013 worst outcome. In case of a low level of risk aversion the \u201cmaximax\u201d \napproach recommends to select the decision that maximizes the best outcome. Both \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n128 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nmaximin and maximax are extreme alternatives; most space scientists prefer an \nintermediate approach. The Hurwicz criterion assumes a compromise  fi gure  a  0 <  a  <1   . \nWhen  a  = 0 the decision is Maximin and when  a  = 1 it is Maximax. Once  a  is \nselected, the rule requires the computation of:\n\n     { }Max [max ] (1 )[min ]i ij ijE a E? + ?     \n Where     E   ij   is the performance of the  i th decision when the  j th future occurs.  \n\n    5.8.3.   Probabilistic approaches \n\n In many situations it will be possible to assign probability distributions to the likeli-\nhood of the various possible futures affecting each decision. This permits creating \nprobability density functions for each decision. Figure  5.7  provided possible proba-\nbility density functions for a design to performance or a design to cost decision. In \nthis case the tools of probabilistic    analysis would be used to support decision \nmaking. \n\n One possibility is to select the alternative with the best expectation. Expectation \nwas de fi ned already in Section  5.5.4  as the integrated product of the probability of an \noutcome multiplied by the value of that outcome. Recalling Figure     5.7 , if designing \nto performances and in cases having a cost probability density function, it will be \npossible to compare the cost risk expectations for different design alternatives and \nselect the alternative that minimizes the cost expectation. The same approach could \nbe used when comparing several design alternatives in a \u201cdesign to cost   \u201d situation. \nThe expectations of the different performance probability density functions can be \ncalculated and the design alternative with the best performance expectation can then \nbe selected.         \n\n\n\n129M.A. Aguirre, Introduction to Space Systems: Design and Synthesis, Space Technology Library 27, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_6, \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n              Keywords    Project Phases,   Project Reviews,   Milestones,   Technical Development    \n\n The word    diachronic    means \u201cconcerned with the way in which something has evolved \nover time.\u201d It is often opposed to synchronic   . The previous chapter analyzed space \nsystem de fi nition as a synchronic process; the present chapter will analyze it as a \ndiachronic process. Together they provide a comprehensive overview of the system \nde fi nition process. \n\n As indicated in Section   1.1    , the aim of this book is to analyze the proper de fi nition \nof a space system up to the point where the design is detailed enough to allow an accu-\nrate estimation of the system\u2019s effectiveness, cost, and risk, enabling a well-informed \ndecision for or against a fully funded project. This implies that the design progresses \nstep-by-step over time, as a diachronic process with increasing levels of de fi nition. The \naim of the present chapter is to describe the necessary steps to reach this goal. \n\n The chapter begins by pointing    out that the system de fi nition process is at the same \ntime recurrent and linear, and it continues with two complementary sections: the  fi rst \none describing the recurrent procedure that is used to advance the de fi nition, followed \nby an analysis of system de fi nition as it advances linearly through the three standard \nphases: 0, A, and B1, which normally occur before project\u2019s formal approval. Next \nthere is a discussion of the milestones that enable the system de fi nition to advance \nfrom phase to phase, and a comparison of the logic of a speci fi c \u201creal life\u201d system \nde fi nition with the descriptions provided in the previous sections. The chapter winds \nup with a section describing necessary developments in technical maturity and science, \nwhich are parallel to the main de fi nition process but that are not normally part of it. \n\n    6.1.   The system de fi nition process as recurrent and linear \n\n Section   1.4     provided a dual, and to a degree, contradictory view of the design process   : \nFigure   1.3     portrays it as recursive and cyclical, while Figures   1.4     and   1.5     depict it as \nlinear and progressive. The truth is that though the de fi nition process is indeed recur-\nsive, each cycle implies an increasingly better level of de fi nition; that is, there is a \nprogressive advancement from cycle to cycle. \n\n Section   1.5     introduced the project phases as de fi ned by the commonly used stan-\ndards. Of these phases \u2013 from 0 to F \u2013 those normally included in the system \nde fi nition process are Phases 0, A, B, and C. \n\n    Chapter 6   \n\n System De fi nition as a Diachronic Process       \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n130 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n The  fi rst three phases de fi ned in Section   1.5     where:\n\n   Phase 0   . Establishment of mission aims  \u2022 \n  Phase A.    Feasibility  \u2022 \n  Phase B. Preliminary de fi nition  \u2022 \n  Phase C. Detailed de fi nition    \u2022 \n\n The process, however, is never as neatly sequential as implied by these phase \ndesignations, where there is a continuous  fl ow from the establishment of needs, to the \nestablishment of requirements formalizing those needs, and then a design ful fi lling \nthe requirements. Actually, Phase 0    already involves a fair amount of requirements \nestablishment, and even some design, while Phase A    requires a fairly detailed system \ndesign (detailed enough to provide good cost and risk estimates, allowing a well-\ninformed project approval decision). It is far better to view the process as recursive, \nconsisting of several steps with a similar structure and aims but with an increasing \nlevel of detail, and correspondence among user needs, requirements on system ele-\nments, cost, risk, and design. In real life, the working logic and aims of Phases 0 and \nA are similar, as are the results, con fi rming the view that the system de fi nition process \nis recursive. Successive iterations result in greater understanding and can reveal criti-\ncal requirements and design drivers. \n\n Nevertheless, the process advances and the  fi rst \u201cformal\u201d set of mission require-\nments    establishing the consumer   \u2019s demands on the customer    is typically produced \nat the end of Phase 0   , while the  fi rst formal set of system requirements that clearly \nand unambiguously establish the customer\u2019s demands on the supplier    comes at the \nend of the Phase A   . The end of Phase 0 might also allow rough cost estimations, a \npreliminary analysis of mission cost and risk and early technology development \nplans \u2013 prior to full project go-ahead \u2013 in order to reduce the project\u2019s future over-\nall risk. Still, in order to reach a level of design detailed enough for credible cost \nand risk estimations, the second design iteration provided by Phase A must be \nperformed. This is because it is impossible to produce a credible cost estimation    \nuntil a  fi rm set of requirements and a subsequent design are established, and that \nwill not happen until the end of Phase A or B1, depending on how the work is \norganized.  \n\n    6.2.   System de fi nition as a recursive process \n\n It is unavoidable to describe the diachronic process of space system design without \nstarting from the steps de fi ned by J. Wertz in his standard text,  Space Missions \nAnalysis and Design  1 . He de fi nes the following steps:\n\n   De fi ne objectives:\u2022 \n\n   1.    De fi ne broad objectives and constraints.  \n   2.    Estimate qualitative and quantitative mission needs and requirements.      \n\n   1   Space Missions Analysis and Design, James Wertz and Wiley Larson, SLT, Kluwer 1999.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n131System Definition as a Diachronic Process\n\n  Characterize the mission:\u2022 \n\n    3.

Identify critical requirements, i.e., identify the most important performance \n fi gures that are driving the entire design.  \n\n    8.    Evaluate utility and cost of each alternative mission concept.  \n    9.    De fi ne the baseline.  \n   10.    Formalize or update requirements.        \n\n Step 1 of the process frequently occurs prior to the involvement of a mission archi-\ntect   ; with the consumer    producing a mission statement    that describes the basic \naims of the mission, its uses, and frequently also recommends an observing tech-\nnique   , including a speci fi c instrument technology. This approach is driven by \nusers/consumers   . In other cases it might be a new observing technique that spurs a \nsearch for possible applications; this second approach is technology driven. \nWhatever the approach, as soon as a general statement of objectives is produced, \nthe mission architect will proceed to analyze the mission. The process of de fi ning \nbroad objectives was introduced in Section   3.2.1     and will be further analyzed in \nSection   8.1     when discussing observation techniques    and observables   . Chapter   4    , \nespecially Sections   4.4    ,   4.5    ,   4.6    , and   4.7    , analyzed sponsor   -generated constraints \nand how they apply to different types of projects. An early analysis of the program-\nmatic constraints    by the architect is also necessary to ensure that the mission con-\ncept can be achieved within the budget, schedule, and risk limits established by the \nsponsor. \n\n Step 2 embraces the tasks necessary for creating the  fi rst set of formalized qualita-\ntive and quantitative mission requirements    and will create a progressively more \nde fi ned mission requirements document    delineating the mission performances from \nthe consumer   \u2019s viewpoint, which will eventually become the source of the system \nrequirements document    delineating mission performances from the customer   \u2019s per-\nspective. This process was described in Section   3.2.1    . The  fi rst formal \u201cMission \nRequirements Document\u201d is normally issued at the end of Phase 0   , when the  fi rst loop \nof the design process    has been completed. This document contains all the quantitative \nand qualitative requirements crucial to the consumer, as well as some key numerical \nrequirements regarding the instruments    of special interest to the consumer for ensur-\ning the high quality of the data to be produced. \n\n Step 3 includes the establishment of broad guidelines: for data production and \ndelivery; for the communication architecture; for tasking, scheduling, and control; \nand for the overall mission timeline. These broad guidelines must be produced in \ncollaboration with the consumer    because the nature of the observables    will determine \nhow they will be observed. Observables will also shape the mission operation concept \nin terms of data type, data  fl ow, and data speed, and the kinds of interactions that will \nbe necessary among the orbiting instrument, ground operations, and consumers   . \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\n\n\n132 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nThese factors will shape how the mission will operate and will establish criteria for \nthe interfaces between the satellite, ground control, and consumers. \n\n In Step 4, mission characterization continues with the de fi nition of alternative mis-\nsion concepts including designs for a mission concept, payload, satellite bus, launcher, \norbit, ground system and communications architecture, as well as a concept for mis-\nsion operations    architecture, in line with the operations concepts outlined in Step 3. \nSo concepts must be provided for all the elements described in Figure   5.1    , Section   5.1    , \nwhich together produce a space mission. This step will establish the mission\u2019s high-\nest-level architecture and will de fi ne the interrelations between its elements. In the \nmain, the de fi nition of alternative mission concepts entails taking functional design    \ndecisions, i.e., deciding which elements perform which functions and how they will \nbe performed. \n\n Step 5 identi fi es system design drivers. Drivers are the design features that will \ndrive the mission in terms of performance and cost/risk. Designing a space system \nrequires many design decisions; nevertheless, not all design decisions are of equal \nimportance and key performances and allied design decisions that are crucial to mis-\nsion performances must be identi fi ed. \n\n Step 6 expands on Step 5, providing designs for the system elements. The design\u2019s \ndegree of detail depends on the speci fi c stage of the mission\u2019s de fi nition. In Phase 0   , \nthis step will focus on the most important and innovative aspects of the mission, \nwhich nearly always involve the instruments   . During Phase A   , this step requires a \nfairly detailed design of all the mission elements, with a very detailed design of the \nmission\u2019s most innovative elements in order to provide credible estimations for over-\nall mission cost   , schedule,    and risk    and to provide good quality numerical estimations \nof mission effectiveness   . \n\n In Step 7, the broad mission drivers identi fi ed will be transformed into critical \nrequirements    that will determine in turn other lower-level design decisions as well as \nlower-level requirements   . The process of establishing the alternative architectures \nalso allows the identi fi cation of these critical requirements. Note that critical require-\nments (for example, a telescope   \u2019s aperture size) are related to important system \neffectiveness parameters that will be used to judge the value of the mission from the \nconsumer   \u2019s point of view. Section   3.4     discussed system effectiveness. System effec-\ntiveness will be further analyzed in Section   8.5     when discussing end-to-end mission \nperformance simulation. \n\n Step 8 quanti fi es mission effectiveness    and the cost    of the alternative mission \nconcepts identi fi ed in Step 4, permitting a comparison of the different concepts. \nMission effectiveness must be measured with respect to the most important require-\nments    identi fi ed as mission drivers, which are likely to be the most important in sat-\nisfying consumer    needs as well as the most demanding (as far as implementation \ndif fi culty, cost, and risk    are concerned) when creating designs to meet them. Mission \nevaluation entails estimations of cost, risk, and scheduling   . Relevant methods were \ndescribed in the corresponding sections of Chapter   4    . \n\n Step 9 involves performing trade-offs    and choosing the best design option. The \nchoice must balance the performances derived from the system\u2019s effectiveness with \nthe programmatic constraints    established by the sponsor   . The best solution will \ndepend not only on ful fi lling the speci fi ed mission performances but on the program-\nmatic environment as well. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n133System Definition as a Diachronic Process\n\n Step 10, in line with the recurrent nature of the procedure described in this section, \nrefers back to Steps 1 and 2. Step 10 will update the higher-level requirements    and \nalso formalize the lower-level requirements    resulting from the design decisions. This \nstep enables the original mission and system requirements documents    to be updated \nand expanded, providing a higher level of certainty. \n\n Figure  6.1  provides a visual representation of these steps, their interrelations and \nhow they interact with consumer    requirements and sponsor    constraints. As indicated \nin Figure  6.1 , this process is understood as cyclical and it must be repeated until the \nproposed mission is  fi nally approved or is canceled. Analysis performed at each step \nmay cause reconsideration of high-level synthesis decisions and trigger another epi-\nsode of synthesis and analysis.   \n\n    6.3.

The process of system de fi nition involves manipulation of models, and as \nthe design advances the models become progressively more concrete. \n\n Prior to project go-ahead, available funds are moderate and the teams involved \nare coordinated by the person acting as system architect   . The architect\u2019s role is not \nrestricted solely to high-level considerations. Architects also look at speci fi c compo-\nnents and domain details when necessary to establish feasibility and determine per-\nformances that are important to the consumer   . The overall process is one of \nhigh-level structuring and synthesis, frequently based on nonnumerical heuristics    \nand insight followed by rational and numerical analysis of all the necessary details. \nThe second part of this book \u2013 Chapters   7    ,   8    ,   9    ,   10    , and   12     \u2013 will attempt to foster \nthis nonnumerical insight by presenting and analyzing numerous examples of space \nsystem design. \n\n The present section offers a detailed description of well-de fi ned phases with out-\nputs and reviews clearly delineated and in line with ECSS    standards, and compares \nthem with NASA\u2019s de fi nition of phases. In general, ESA uses the same names as \nNASA, but ESA\u2019s phases are denser and contain more output, even to the extent that \na portion of ESA\u2019s Phase A    is found in NASA\u2019s Phase B. In real life, however, the \ncontents of each phase can be slightly different than the references provided by the \ntwo agencies. When the actual contents of Phase A are lighter, Phase B1    should be \nincluded as the last stage before full project go-ahead. Where Phase A is proportion-\nally denser, a well-substantiated full project go-ahead is possible at the end of Phase \nA. Whatever the case, it is important to understand the need for a suf fi ciently detailed \nlevel of mission de fi nition at the moment of the decision on full project go-ahead. If \na good level of de fi nition is achieved the project can proceed, independent of the \nname given to the phase in which it was achieved. \n\n In any case, and to help reduce mission risk   , it is better to wait until project go-\nahead and to accomplish enough preparatory work to solve as many problems as \npossible. As Figure   1.1     showed, missions in whom the de fi nition phases were well \nfunded did not experience large cost    overruns during their implementation. \n\n    6.3.1.   Phase 0 \n\n ECSS    2  de fi nes Phase 0    as identifying the overall needs, and establishing a preliminary \nconcept and a set of overall requirements for a mission. The main activities during \nthis phase are:\n\n   Analyze requirements and mission constraints: physical, operational, and pro-\u2022 \ngrammatic aspects.  \n  Analyze basic feasibility of the observing technique   .  \u2022 \n  Analyze alternative architectures.  \u2022 \n  Propose a preliminary architecture and basic design of the observing system with \u2022 \nemphasis on the critical aspects.  \n  Produce mission requirements   .  \u2022 \n  Provide a rough cost estimate    and rough schedule estimate   .    \u2022 \n\n   2   Project phasing and Planning, ECSS    M 30, ESA 1996.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n135System Definition as a Diachronic Process\n\n In Phase 0, the consumer    or customer    shall evaluate the nominal limit and external \nenvironmental conditions in which the system will undertake its mission, and shall also \nestablish the expected performance. The customer must also de fi ne and characterize \nthe functions of the system; identify and evaluate different possible system concepts \nand critical, innovative aspects; and identify the environment for possible project \nimplementation. The expected output of this phase includes:\n\n   Mission requirements document     \u2022 \n  System preliminary functional speci fi cation  \u2022 \n  System concepts, concepts trade-off,    and supporting analysis  \u2022 \n  Project framework including target budget  \u2022 \n  Technology risk and status    \u2022 \n\n Altogether, Phase 0    is a trial-run of the mission de fi nition process as described in \nFigure  6.1 . It provides a  fi rst opportunity for adjusting the consumer   \u2019s performance \nneeds whilst remaining within the cost constraints and the sponsor   \u2019s appetite for risk. \nThe resulting mission concept or concepts are still tentative, but provide reference \npoints for subsequent work. The last task of Phase 0 is to identify developments \nessential to advancing the technology readiness level    of mission-critical items, a cru-\ncial step for reducing mission risk; this will be covered in Section  6.4.1 . \n\n NASA 3  indicates the main aim of Phase 0    as producing a broad spectrum of ideas \nand alternatives for the mission, from which new programs and projects can be \nselected. According to NASA\u2019s view, Phase 0 shall include not only interaction with \nthe consumer    to produce the mission\u2019s preliminary objectives and justi fi cation, but \nalso a possible operation concept; mission architecture; and cost, schedule, and risk \nestimates. To accomplish all this, it is necessary to provide a preliminary mission \ndesign with an especially detailed focus on the most novel and critical elements of the \nsystem. This approach emphasizes the role of Phase 0 as a source of ideas that may \nor may not become reality. It is not only possible but advisable to initiate many more \nPhases 0s than missions actually expected to become reality, because the cost of this \nphase is comparatively moderate and makes possible the natural selection of the most \npromising mission concepts. \n\n A mission design with an acceptable level of detail for a Phase 0    could in theory \nbe accomplished and properly documented in a concurrent design    facility in a period \nof about 1 or 2 months. Nevertheless, Phase 0\u2019s mission aims are not yet clearly \nde fi ned and they entail constant interaction among consumer   , customer,    and supplier    \nto enable mutual accommodation of design requirements and constraints, which \nmeans that a Phase 0 is not merely a preliminary design stage responding to a set of \nrequirements; it requires enough time to carry out all the necessary interactions, and \nwill actually take from 6 months to 1 year to complete.  \n\n    6.3.2.   Phase A \n\n ECSS    de fi nes Phase A    as de fi ning the mission\u2019s feasibility. This phase establishes the \nsystem\u2019s functional requirements and provides a solid system de fi nition along with \n\n   3   NASA System Engineering Handbook, SP-610S, NASA 1995.  \n\n\n\n136 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nperformance and risk estimates. All the mission areas that are risky, novel, or \n connected with the fundamental performance requirements must be studied and \nde fi ned in detail. This phase must:\n\n   Analyze and further re fi ne the already existing mission and system requirement \u2022 \ndocuments.  \n  Produce and compare alternative architectures and designs for all the elements of \u2022 \nthe system.  \n  Propose a baseline design: mission, platform, payload, and ground segment    func-\u2022 \ntional block operations concept.  \n  Provide analytical support to the system de fi nitions under consideration to demon-\u2022 \nstrate that they are compatible with system requirements.  \n  Perform trade-off   s at all levels in order to choose a baseline de fi nition.  \u2022 \n  Allocate requirement to system elements and also derive requirements for the \u2022 \ninternal and external interfaces.  \n  Provide the preliminary design for all the elements of the end-to-end system and \u2022 \nanalyze and design all the critical elements with the necessary level of detail to \nproperly quantify them with a view to demonstrate their technical and economic \nfeasibility and adequacy.    \n\n This repeats the activity performed in Phase 0    but with a higher degree of de fi nition \nand progressively higher level of certainty. This demands additional interaction \nbetween the consumer    and customer    to reach an agreement on requirements not made \n fi rm during the previous phase. Customer-supplier    interaction will be especially \nintense in this phase because they have to produce a  fi rm system design baseline. The \nproposed baseline shall be analyzed not only to ensure the mission\u2019s basic feasibility \nbut to produce credible estimations of performance cost and risk. \n\n So Phase A    generates a  fi rm set of system requirements, an observational concept, \nand an end-to-end system de fi nition and estimation of performances. The outputs \nresulting from this phase are:\n\n   Mission design de fi nition and supporting analysis  \u2022 \n  Developmental approach for the implementation of the mission: product tree, \u2022 \nmajor development risks and mitigation approach, model philosophy,    and if \nneeded, organization for the future project  \n  Cost and risk estimations  \u2022 \n  End-to-end mission performances  \u2022 \n  Consolidated system functional speci fi cation including interface requirements    \u2022 \nbetween mean mission elements    \n\n Phase A    must demonstrate that a feasible and well-substantiated design for the \nsystem exists. It is not necessary to de fi ne in detail every single item of the system, \nbut it must be detailed enough to ensure the credibility of both the system perfor-\nmance and the cost and risk estimates. This obliges all the novel components of the \nsystem to be designed and analyzed to a fairly high level of detail. The need for all \ncritical components to be de fi ned with a high degree of detail is in line with our basic \nde fi nition of system architecture as a dossier that enables a well-informed decision to \nbe made on project go-ahead. \n\n\n\n137System Definition as a Diachronic Process\n\n At the end of Phase A   , the project goes through a number of reviews to verify the \nrequirements to be ful fi lled, the standard of technical de fi nition, and the system\u2019s risk \nand development status, which ultimately lead to the project\u2019s approval or rejection. \nProject reviews will be studied in the following section. \n\n During Phase A the veri fi cation activities are focused on the assessment of the \ngeneral project requirements and the de fi nition of the development and veri fi cation \napproach   , including the Model Philosophy and the associated Hardware Matrix. The \nresults are discussed at the Preliminary Requirement Review (PRR) in order to assess \nthe feasibility of the development and veri fi cation program. \n\n Also during Phase A, it is necessary to perform the appropriate tasks for reducing \nthe mission risks identi fi ed in Phase 0 and which should be running in parallel with \nPhase A. These activities (described further in Section 6.5.1   ) include design, manu-\nfacturing, and testing of the critical items under review. \n\n NASA also considers Phase A    as a structured version of the previous phase that \nshould include: the development of top-down    requirements and their corresponding \nrequirements evaluation metrics and criteria; the identi fi cation of alternative opera-\ntions concepts, system constraints,    and system boundaries; and the provision of alter-\nnative design concepts with supporting feasibility and risk    studies, cost    and schedule    \nestimates, and advanced technology developmental needs and plans. In NASA\u2019s \nscheme, Phase A should determine the feasibility and desirability of a suggested new \nmajor system, and its compatibility with strategic plans.  \n\n    6.3.3.   Phase B1 \n\n Phase B1    may or may not be performed before the project receives formal approval. \nPhase B1 builds on the requirements outlined in the system requirements document    \nproduced in Phase A    and  fi xes the apportioning of functions and performance (and \nhence interfaces) to the system\u2019s elements. This phase also re fi nes the design work \ndone during Phase A by producing a fairly detailed analysis of all the system\u2019s parts, \nincluding the less innovative and less risky ones. The decision to include or skip \nPhase B1 will be made by the sponsor   . It is advisable to include this phase in larger \nor more advanced systems calling for more detailed analysis of all the system\u2019s \naspects and their interrelations, in order to reduce the risks associated with project \napproval. \n\n ECSS    calls Phase B the \u201cde fi nition phase.\u201d According to this approach, Phase B \ncontinues and deepens the system de fi nition created in Phase A   . Phase B1    provides a \nhigher-level de fi nition, while Phase B2 re fi nes the de fi nition to the most detailed \nlevel. The tasks associated with Phase B1 are:\n\n   Based on the requirements formulated in Phase A, derive and negotiate require-\u2022 \nments for the subsystems and requisite lower-level components.  \n  Freeze basic mission elements: launcher, instrument concept, satellite platform   , \u2022 \noperational approach, and data processing.  \n  Analyze alternative design implementation for subsystems and components that \u2022 \nwere not analyzed in Phase A.  \n  Select subsystem    designs.  \u2022 \n  Support the selected designs by analysis, verifying the ful fi llment of requirements.  \u2022 \n\n\n\n138 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  Freeze interface speci fi cations    between main system elements.  \u2022 \n  Produce preliminary speci fi cations for elements and subsystems.  \u2022 \n  If the project is already fully approved, produce management plans    and supporting \u2022 \ndocumentation.  \n  Provide a preliminary list of mission products    and their characteristics.  \u2022 \n  Re fi ne end-to-end mission simulation.  \u2022 \n  Provide a preliminary design for mission operations.     \u2022 \n  Provide preliminary designs for ground data processing and consumer   -to-mission \u2022 \noperations    interactions.  \n  Perform early developmental tasks in critical areas as needed, including design \u2022 \nmanufacturing and testing of technologies crucial to mission success.  \n  Assessment of manufacturing, assembly, veri fi cation, and test approaches and \u2022 \nassociated costs.  \n  Procurement of long-lead items   ; that is, items requiring long waiting periods \u2022 \nbefore being delivered.    \n\n The outputs of the Phase B1 will be:\n\n   Detailed mission design de fi nition and supporting analysis  \u2022 \n  Assessment of performance versus performance requirements  \u2022 \n  Major plans: management, development, assembly integration and veri fi cation, \u2022 \nproduct assurance and safety  \n  Controlled system con fi guration  \u2022 \n  Updated cost and risk estimations  \u2022 \n  Updated end-to-end mission performance  \u2022 \n  System-wide technical speci fi cation and support speci fi cations including frozen \u2022 \nde fi nition of interface requirements    between the main system elements    \n\n In the area of system design the transition from Phase A    to Phase B1    is smooth \nbecause the same design approach is employed for lower-level subsystems and com-\nponents; nevertheless, the design of the system during Phase B1 will always require \nthe involvement of a larger number of technical experts than in Phase A. \n\n In the area of project management   , Phase B1    requires the production of more \ndetailed documentation on project organization and cost and risk estimation. Phase \nB1 also calls for a fairly detailed description of the test approach, including detailed \nde fi nitions of complex tests that will become cost and schedule drivers. The docu-\nmentation produced by the supplier   , however, will be of a preliminary nature and not \nlegally binding    until the project is formally approved and commenced. \n\n If the project has already been approved and fully funded by the end of Phase A   , \nPhase B1    will represent a major break with the previous phases because a project team \nmust be created with separate support, engineering, and management roles and the \nestablishment of a hierarchical structure among its members. The formal launch of the \nproject will also make the supplier   \u2019s cost    and schedule    commitments legally binding   . \n\n NASA\u2019s B phase is de fi nitely lighter than ECSS   \u2019s corresponding phase of the \nsame name. For NASA, the aim of Phase B is to establish the project\u2019s baseline, \nwhich includes a formal  fl ow-down of the highest-level performance requirements to \na complete set of system and subsystem    speci fi cations for space and ground elements. \nThe baseline consists of technical and business aspects of the project. In the technical \n\n\n\n139System Definition as a Diachronic Process\n\npart of the baseline these include: requirements and speci fi cations, designs, \nveri fi cation, and operations plans. In the business portion, schedules, cost, and man-\nagement plans are produced. The establishment of a baseline implies the implementa-\ntion of the con fi guration management    procedures. 4  During the Phase B, NASA \nperforms a \u201cnonadvocacy\u201d review, in order to judge the soundness of the project \nbeing considered. This review provides con fi dence prior to formal authorization. This \nmeans that in NASA\u2019s scheme, Phase B comes before project approval.   \n\n    6.4.   Mission milestones and reviews \n\n Milestones    are management events enabling the system de fi nition to proceed step-by-\nstep until full project go-ahead is received. As each milestone is successfully passed, \nfunds for the next step are allocated, until  fi nal approval results in the allocation of \nfunds for the entire system\u2019s implementation. The allocation of funds and the author-\nity to proceed is in the hands of the sponsor   . Two situations are possible:\n\n   The sponsor    delegates approval responsibility to the consumer.     \u2022 \n  The sponsor    makes the decision himself.    \u2022 \n\n In the  fi rst case, some form of scienti fi c \u201cpeer review team\u201d analyzes different \nmissions and ranks them in terms of relative merit, approving one or more for con-\ntinuation. In this case, the sponsor    will have previously provided guidelines on the \nmaximum cost allowable per mission and on the number of missions allowed to move \nforward. In the second case, the sponsor undertakes an analysis of the potential per-\nformances, risks, and costs of each mission and either authorizes or rejects them. The \ncustomer    shall provide all the documentation necessary for enabling a well-informed \ndecision as well as advise or clari fi cation where needed, though approval is the exclu-\nsive decision of the sponsor. The number of mission approval milestones    varies from \nproject to project and the sponsor, in consultation with the consumer   , de fi nes their \nexact number. The  fi nal milestone will be the authorization for project go-ahead. In \norder to proceed with project implementation, it must be demonstrated that the sys-\ntem satis fi es the consumer\u2019s requirements within the constraints of the sponsor. \nQuestions such as the following must be addressed before formal approval is \nconceded:\n\n   Are the allocations contained in the system speci fi cations suf fi cient to meet mis-\u2022 \nsion objectives?  \n  Are the evaluation criteria established and realistic?  \u2022 \n  Are measures of effectiveness established and realistic?  \u2022 \n  Are cost estimates established and realistic?  \u2022 \n  Has a system veri fi cation concept been identi fi ed?  \u2022 \n  Have appropriate plans to support projected system development milestones being \u2022 \ninitiated?  \n  Have critical technology development issues been identi fi ed along with approaches \u2022 \nto their solution?    \n\n   4   NASA System Engineering Handbook, SP-610S, NASA 1995.  \n\n\n\n140 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n Mission reviews    are examinations of the technical status of a system at a particular \npoint in time. Their primary purpose is to provide a comprehensive and independent \nassessment of the technical progress being achieved. Independence is provided by the \nparticipation in the review of external experts not involved in the mission\u2019s de fi nition \nprocess. Every review involves three parties:\n\n   Independent technical experts from the customer   \u2019s organization not directly \u2022 \ninvolved in the mission  \n  The customer   \u2019s mission team  \u2022 \n  The supplier       \u2022 \n\n Reviews are events in which the customer    evaluates the work performed by the \nsupplier   . Relations between them are regulated by contractual agreements that clearly \ndetermine the quality and quantity of work to be provided and how it is to be deliv-\nered. The contractual relationship between customer and supplier also speci fi es the \nnature and number of the reviews to be performed. Two teams represent the customer \nin the review: the customer team directly involved in day-to-day work with the sup-\nplier, and the customer\u2019s team of independent technical experts. All customer repre-\nsentatives review the work produced by the supplier, but in addition to this, the \nindependent technical experts evaluate the work performed by their colleagues \ninvolved in the day-to-day interactions with the supplier. \n\n The customer    divides his review into groups dealing with the main areas of techni-\ncal expertise: instruments, satellite platform   , operations, quality assurance, manage-\nment, and others. The number of groups varies according to the complexity of the \nmission. To ensure the review\u2019s independence the number and authority of customer \nrepresentatives who are members of the project team is balanced with those who are \nindependent. Above these groups there is a review board that discusses issues of \nspecial importance that could not be agreed upon at group-level, and that decides on \nactions to be taken regarding these issues as well as providing a  fi nal judgment on the \nstatus of the system implementation. The majority of board members remain outside \nthe project. The supplier    also organizes teams to confer with the customer\u2019s technical \nexperts, while the supplier\u2019s project management    group will also discuss with the \nreview board any issues left unresolved by the technical experts. In principle, neither \nthe consumer    nor the sponsor    is directly involved in the review process. Nevertheless, \nboth are informed of the outcome, which becomes part of the documentation accom-\npanying the mission milestone process. During the earliest phases of mission \nde fi nition, when requirements are not yet  fi rmly established, intense, albeit informal, \ninvolvement of the consumer is crucial to the review process. Consumer awareness \nof the relevant technical discussions will permit a fuller understanding of the \ndif fi culties involved in satisfying the requested mission performances, which directly \nimpacts  fi nal agreement on mission requirements   . \n\n Reviews are a long and expensive process requiring many hours of analysis and \ndiscussion resulting in actions and recommendations to be implemented by the cus-\ntomer    and supplier   . But they also provide a unique opportunity to produce a detailed \nindependent evaluation of the system\u2019s status. The presence of the customer\u2019s inde-\npendent reviewers is especially valuable for identifying hidden problems, but also \nmakes the reviews long and cumbersome. This is why there is a tendency to stream-\nline the review process, signi fi cantly reducing the effort, cost, and time involved. \n\n\n\n141System Definition as a Diachronic Process\n\nThis will be further examined in Chapter   13     when discussing cheaper mission \nimplementation methods. \n\n    6.4.1.   Review procedure \n\n Reviews are performed according to formal procedures    proposed by the customer   . \nThese procedures de fi ne the review\u2019s objectives, the participants, their af fi liations \nand responsibilities, the designation of specialized groups, the list of documents \nunder review, the overall schedule, planned meetings, and the procedures and tools \nfor the creation and processing of review item discrepancies    (RID). RIDs are items \nfor discussion referring to points contained in the documents under review and that \nthe customer review team wants to discuss with the supplier   . RIDs are produced and \ndiscussed until there is agreement on how to proceed between customer and supplier. \nBesides the processed RIDs, the different review groups will produce documents \nevaluating the quality of the work performed as well as suggestions or recommenda-\ntions on how to proceed. These documents, along with any unresolved RIDs are \npresented to a customer review board with decision-making authority for all outstand-\ning questions. This board will also provide  fi nal resolutions on the review\u2019s outcome, \nand will issue  fi nal directives and recommendations on how to proceed.  \n\n    6.4.2.   Reviews during the mission de fi nition stages \n\n Figure   1.5    , which is inspired by ECSS    5 , identi fi es the following reviews during the \nmission de fi nition phases:\n\n   Mission De fi nition Review    (MDR) at the end of the Phase 0  \u2022 \n  Preliminary Requirements Review    (PRR) at the end of the Phase A  \u2022 \n  System Requirements Review    (SRR) at the end of Phase B1    \u2022 \n\n The next paragraphs will describe their contents in some detail. \n\n    6.4.2.1.   Phase 0 \n Phase 0    ends with an MDR to con fi rm the mission requirements    and to assess the \nbasic feasibility of the proposed mission concept, with special emphasis on the \nobserving techniques. The MDR has a number of features that makes it different from \nthe other reviews:\n\n   Its main aim is to con fi rm the mission requirements    agreed to between the con-\u2022 \nsumer    and the customer   ; therefore, the consumer\u2019s participation is crucial.  \n  In Phase 0 the customer    and supplier    teams involved in the work are very small.  \u2022 \n  The system\u2019s speci fi cations are still tentative so reviewers cannot resolve RID \u2022 \n\u201cdiscrepancies\u201d between the supplier   \u2019s concept and the system\u2019s provisional \nrequirements.    \n\n With these factors in mind, the MDR is never a formal review adhering to a formal \nprocedure, but more a set of discussions between representatives of the consumer   , \n\n   5   Organization and Conduct of Reviews, ECSS   -M-30-01, ESA 1999.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_13\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n142 Introduction to Space Systems\n\ncustomer,    and supplier    directly involved in the mission de fi nition, along with certain \ncustomer experts external to the project, who are principally specialists in the areas \nof risk assessment   , cost estimation,    and observation techniques   . They provide an \nindependent assessment of the proposed concepts. The aim of these discussions is to \nagree on a set of mission requirements    giving rise to a mission concept in line with \nthe cost and risk guidelines provided by the sponsor   .  \n\n    6.4.2.2.   Phase A \n Phase A    ends with a PRR. This provides a sound concept baseline and freezes the \nsystem requirements document containing the highest-level system requirements. \nThe aims of this review are:\n\n   To evaluate the results of Phase A.  \u2022 \n  Evaluate the validity of the concept proposed in response to the preliminary sys-\u2022 \ntem requirements document.  \n  Release the system requirements document    (SRD).  \u2022 \n  Verify downward the consistency of the higher-level SRD requirements    with the \u2022 \nallocations of functions and performances to lower-level system elements.  \n  Derive preliminary interface requirements    between system elements from the \u2022 \nallocation of functions    and performances.  \n  Provide detailed risk   , cost   , schedule    design, and development approaches for the \u2022 \nproject.    \n\n The PRR has to demonstrate that the proposed preliminary design satis fi es the \nagreed-upon requirements; i.e., that the proposed concepts are feasible, that the expected \nperformances are in line with user needs, and that the cost and schedule are in line with \nprogrammatic constraints   . The PRR can well be a formal review in line with the \napproach and procedures described in the previous sections. Two situations are \npossible:\n\n   The decision on project go-ahead will be made immediately after the PRR.  \u2022 \n  The decision on project go-ahead will be delayed until the SRR.    \u2022 \n\n If the project go-ahead decision is taken just after the PRR, its outcome must be \ndetailed enough to provide clear and credible estimations on feasibility, adequacy \nof the proposed concept, risk, cost, and expected  fi nal performances, in order to \nallow a well-substantiated decision on the project\u2019s go-ahead. Among other things, \nthis means that all the SRD\u2019s requirements should be clear and unambiguous and \nthat the allocation of functions    and performances to the various mission elements \nshould be quite near to  fi nal status, albeit still preliminary and not yet  fi xed \nfrozen. \n\n If the project go-ahead is delayed until the SRR, the PRR may or may not be \nformal. Formalizing the PRR will provide a supplementary veri fi cation of the ade-\nquacy of the proposed concept and is strongly recommended if the system being \nde fi ned is especially large, complex, or risky. For small and low-cost systems with \nhigher tolerance to failure, and in cases where the SRR follows soon after the PRR, \nit is possible to perform the PRR as an informal evaluation avoiding the costs of \ntwo formal reviews    \u2013 PRR and SRR \u2013 being undertaken with only a brief period \nbetween them.  \n\n\n\n143System Definition as a Diachronic Process\n\n    6.4.2.3.   Phase B1 \n Phase B1    ends with a system requirements review   . The SRR\u2019s aims are the same as \nthe PRR\u2019s, but expanded and more detailed. The aims of this review are:\n\n   Examine the compatibility of the system concept with the allocation of higher \u2022 \nrequirements to lower-level subsystems.  \n  Review the proposed concept, which includes a fairly detailed de fi nition of all the \u2022 \nelements, and evaluate the analysis supporting the concept\u2019s suitability.  \n  Review the proposed framework for initiating the project: plans and procedures, \u2022 \nnecessary resources, cost and schedule estimations, possible industrial organiza-\ntion, recommended early development activities, etc.  \n  Examine the compatibility of the system interface speci fi cations    with system \u2022 \ncomponents.  \n  Freeze the system requirements document    and the resulting interface between the \u2022 \nsystem elements.    \n\n The output of Phase B1    includes a detailed de fi nition of all the mission\u2019s critical \ncomponents and a preliminary de fi nition of all the noncritical ones. This means that \nexperts from all the engineering disciplines must participate. Unlike Phase A, Phase \nB1 includes participation by experts in \u201ctransversal\u201d engineering support disciplines \n(Section   2.6    ) like assembly and test engineering and quality assurance. When not \ndone after the PRR at the end of Phase A   , the outcome of the SRR will enable  fi nal \ncon fi rmation of the program and the decision to start development. When the SRR is \nthe last review before full project approval, it is always a formal review providing an \nindependent evaluation of the work done during the project\u2019s architectural de fi nition \nphases   .    \n\n    6.5.   Parallel developments \n\n In order to undertake a new space program with an acceptable degree of risk, an \noptimized system is not suf fi cient. Also essential are:\n\n   An adequate level of maturity of the technologies to be employed by the \u2022 \nmission.  \n  A thorough understanding of how the observations obtained will be translated into \u2022 \nuseful information for the consumers   .    \n\n Both of these aspects require speci fi c developments to be performed parallel to the \nmain design effort. These developments are strongly linked to the main de fi nition \neffort (Phases 0, A, and B1), while normally remaining independent of it. This section \nwill focus on these two aspects of the overall process. \n\n The amount of time, money, and effort invested in these two facets must accord \nwith the risk avoidance and funding guidelines provided by the sponsor   . Missions \nwith a high degree of responsibility, in which failure is prohibited, require a more \nintense level of effort on both technical development and an understanding of what \nwe might call the mission\u2019s scienti fi c background. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_2\n\n\n144 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    6.5.1.   Technical maturity improvement \n\n As Section  6.3.1  indicated, assessment of the \u201ctechnology risk and status\u201d is one of \nPhase 0\u2019s outputs. Technology maturity levels were examined in Section   4.9.3    ; from \nlevel 1, the least advanced, to the most mature, when the technology has been dem-\nonstrated in orbit. Figure   4.4     also indicated the development areas associated with the \ndifferent technology readiness levels   . Research, which involves Levels 1 and 2, \nentails con fi rming basic feasibility and identifying possible applications and is nor-\nmally performed prior to the beginning of the mission de fi nition process. The most \nadvanced development levels, 7 through 9, are costly and are only meaningful if \nperformed in the framework of a fully  fl edged project. The intermediate levels, from \n3 to 6, are best performed during the mission\u2019s de fi nition phases; Phase 0, Phase A, \nand B1. \n\n The importance of technology development is a function of the type of project \ninvolved (see Section   4.5    ). Technology demonstration missions (Section   4.5.2    ) are \nrisk tolerant and can reasonably start at Level 4 or even 3. Advancement of science \nor operational missions   , on the other hand do not tolerate high levels of failure and \nare usually much more expensive. Hence, both kinds of missions demand that all the \ntechnology  fl own be de fi ned to a degree that minimizes the uncertainty of cost, per-\nformance, and risk. This means that speci fi c development plans, to be executed in \nparallel to the Phases 0 and A, must be established for technology that is fundamental \nto the mission and whose technical maturity level is between 3 and 5 with the target \nto advance all the necessary technologies to level 5 or 6 before the formal approval \nof the project. \n\n In the early stages of technology development the allocation of adequate time for \ntrial and error is crucial. This ample provision of time can be compatible with moder-\nate expenditure. The mission de fi nition period from Phase 0 to Phase B1 is indeed \nricher in time than in funds, and is the right milieu for advancing the technology \nreadiness level enough to reduce project risk. Already approved missions enjoy \nample funds, but a development failure in a key technology will have a major impact \nsince it could delay implementation of the entire project.  \n\n    6.5.2.   Scienti fi c understanding advancement \n\n The proper design of any space mission demands an adequate understanding of the \nentire mission, including the science behind its application, that is, how the data pro-\nduced by the satellite will be transformed into information useful to the consumer   . \n\n A proper understanding of these aspects will help justify the mission and enable a \nmore reliable estimation of its performances. Well-de fi ned procedures for translating \nthe orbiting instrument\u2019s output into high-quality useable information, combined with \nsuitably developed science, will always facilitate project approval. \n\n The two main types of activities in this area are:\n\n   General advancement of the scienti fi c background that is going to be advanced \u2022 \nthrough the implementation of the future space mission  \n  Development of speci fi c algorithms that can be used to provide a true end-to-end \u2022 \nmodel of mission performance    \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n145System Definition as a Diachronic Process\n\n Any truly end-to-end model    will require the integration of many different  modules, \nproduced by experts in various scienti fi c  fi elds. Section   8.5     and Figure   8.19     provide \ngood examples of these models\u2019 complexity; to determine  fi nal performances of a \nradar altimeter    satellite providing information on ocean circulation    the required mod-\nules include: radar engineering, ionosphere science, precision orbit determination,    \nand atmospheric dynamics, in addition to help from the ocean dynamics specialists \nand oceanographers. \n\n These end-to-end models are crucial for gauging the output of the images with \nrespect to costs. This will enable not only comparison of  fi nal mission performances \nwith costs, but also between different design alternatives, allowing selection of the \nbest possible solutions. Given that they are important tools for the design process    as \na whole, these models should be produced as early as possible. \n\n As is the case for technology maturity levels, these activities are carried out in \nparallel and in close coordination with the main thrust    of mission design. This coor-\ndination is even closer for activities involved with the production of end-to-end \n mission effectiveness tools    because they are directly linked to mission design work.         \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n147M.A. Aguirre, Introduction to Space Systems: Design and Synthesis, Space Technology Library 27, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7, \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n              Keywords    Design Interactions,   Design Domains,   System Breakdown,   Astronomical \nObservatory Satellite,   System of Systems    \n\n This is    the  fi rst chapter of the second part of the book. It examines the interrelations \nbetween the components and elements of a space system and how they interact \ntogether during the design process   . To study these interactions, the overall design \nspace    will be divided into domains. Each design domain    is de fi ned as a speci fi c area \nwhere multiple design decisions interact strongly with one another, while they inter-\nact only weakly with design decisions external to the domain. The main tool for the \nstudy of these interactions is the comparison and analysis of past design examples. To \nprovide an introductory perspective on the highest-level design decisions, the chapter \nanalyzes the evolution over time of a very speci fi c type of mission: the \u201cAstronomical \nObservatory\u201d mission. A number of past astronomical observatory    missions    will be \npresented and their highest-level design decisions \u2013 orbit, overall data  fl ow, attitude, \noverall satellite con fi guration   , operations \u2013 will be analyzed and compared. \n\n This chapter will also review several general topics that are better discussed before \nthe design domains themselves are studied in detail in the following chapters. These \ntopics are related to supra-satellite design decisions: single versus multi-satellite mis-\nsions and system of systems   . \n\n    7.1.   Design interactions and design domains \n\n As mentioned in Chapter   1    , we will not describe in detail the contents of the different \nspace engineering disciplines, but concentrate instead on the interactions between all \nthe engineering design decisions and how they drive the system towards the  fi nal \ndesign. In order to organize the study of these interactions, to make them more man-\nageable and understandable, the overall design space    will be divided into the follow-\ning domains:\n\n    1.    The observables    and instruments    domain  \n    2.    The orbit and attitude domain  \n    3.    The satellite con fi guration    and mechanical domain  \n    4.    The operations data  fl ow    and satellite electronics    domain  \n    5.    The instruments output data  fl ow    domain     \n\n    Chapter 7   \n\n Introduction to the Design Domains       \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n148 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n The top-down    derivation of requirements and the most important interactions between \nspace system elements and components, and the resulting division into \u201cnatural\u201d \ndomains can be seen in Figure  7.1 .  \n\n Observables are at the top of the design process. Observables drive the instruments \nor payload concept and the manner in which data shall be acquired and distributed. \nThe instrument and the observables will determine the selection of the satellite orbit \nand attitude. The nature of the observable will also drive the data acquisition and \ndelivery needs of the consumer   , which in turn will drive the operations and instru-\nment data utilization    approaches. At the same time, the instrument, the orbit, and the \nattitude will strongly interact with each other until they  fi t together. The orbit and the \namount of data produced by the instrument will determine the frequency of the space-\nto-ground contacts   . The orbit will drive the selection of the launcher, whose perfor-\nmances will act as a boundary for the orbit and for the satellite\u2019s size and shape. Once \nwe have a highest-level design where all the elements  fi t together, we can proceed \nwith a second, more detailed design loop, which will produce the detailed architec-\nture. This process has been discussed in Sections   6.2     and   6.3     and it is also depicted \nin Figure  7.1  above. \n\n The instruments will be at the root of this second design loop. The instruments \nthemselves will require progressively better-de fi ned designs, which will provide \nthe instrument performance and interface features. The instruments data output \nwill drive the design of the satellite on-board data processing and of the on-board \ndedicated telecommunication equipment that will download the information to \nground.

At the same time, the already established \nsatellite operational approach will push upward and help in the de fi nition of the on-\nboard satellite monitoring and control architecture and of the satellite bidirectional \noperational communications hardware. \n\n The need to accommodate the instruments and provide their required  fi elds of \nview will also fundamentally de fi ne the satellite\u2019s physical con fi guration. The instru-\nments will also drive indirectly the con fi guration through the previous decisions on \nsatellite orbit and attitude, which de fi ne the geometry around the satellite. The \ncon fi guration will also be constrained by the launcher through the limitations that it \nwill impose on satellite mass   , center of gravity    location, and volume in the launch \ncon fi guration   . An independent con fi guration driver will be the need for electrical \npower of the satellite, which will drive the size and location of the solar array   . \n\n The orbit and attitude requirements will drive the design of the corresponding orbit \nand attitude sensors    and actuators and of the strategy for attitude and orbit control. \nThe attitude and orbit control components will also have usually less demanding \ndesign interactions with the satellite con fi guration and with the on-board data \nhandling. \n\n The design of the electrical power provision components can be done rather inde-\npendently from the other design elements. The exception is the size, and con fi guration \nof the solar array    that must be considered in the con fi guration domain, for both its \nstowed-for-launch and in-orbit con fi gurations. \n\n At the end of this second design loop a comprehensive design for the satellite will \nbe available. To check for consistency, it will be necessary to revisit    the  fi tting of all \nthe design decisions previously taken. \n\n The interrelationships depicted in the Figure  7.1  and discussed above demon-\nstrated that to divide the design process    into the  fi ve domains of the  fi gure is indeed \na logical way to introduce order in the design process. \n\n In the following sections, this text is going to introduce the different design \ndomains. Each domain will be revisited and expanded in the following chapters. \n\n    7.1.1.   The observables and instruments domain    \n\n Space missions acquire information over natural or man-made physical objects. \nThese objects are the observables   . The observable, the things the mission wants to \nknow about, is at the root of the mission and it drives the design of all the mission \nelements. \n\n Sometimes the data on the observable can be acquired using widely different tech-\nniques, for example, the atmospheric wind can be observed using active scatterome-\nters (as in MetOp    1 ), passive polarimetric microwave radiometers    (as in Coriolis/\n\n   1     http://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPmetop.html      \n\nhttp://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPmetop.html\n\n\n150 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nWindSat    2 ), or active Doppler LIDAR (as in Aeolus    3 ). In some cases the selection of \nthe optimal observing technique    is in the hands of the space system designer but quite \noften the selection is previous to the beginning of the design process   . In these cases \nthe consumer    or sponsor    already provides the selection as a system constraint   . This \nis normally the case for advancements of science missions; to provide an instrument    \nconcept, which appears in principle adequate for the task, will give more credibility \nto the mission concept. On the other hand, in the case of operational missions    that are \nnormally addressing issues where the science is settled, the designer could be \nentrusted with the responsibility of studying alternative observing techniques to \ndetermine the optimal one. \n\n As already said in Section   5.6.1     and Figure   5.8    , the consumer    shall identify his \nneeds about the observable in terms of:\n\n   Data quality  \u2022 \n  Data quantity  \u2022 \n  System responsiveness       \u2022 \n\n Hipparcos, 4  launched in 1989, was an ESA mission that allowed determining the \nposition of the stars with an accuracy of 0.001 arcsec, the position of 120,000 stars \nwas cataloged, the desired mode of data acquisition was systematic, being a continu-\nous survey of the sky, and the data was sent to Earth    as it was produced, where it was \nprocessed until the data received was suf fi cient to produce an overall map of the sky: \nthe star catalog that was the output of the mission. Therefore, the mode of operation \nof the mission and utilization of the data was fairly constant and automatic during the \nwhole duration of the mission. \n\n The consumer    needs, being related exclusively to the observable   , would be nor-\nmally independent of the observing technique   , but they would have been established \naware of what is possible and very often with a speci fi c observing technique in mind. \nThree situations are possible:\n\n   The observable can be studied by measuring in situ    characteristics of the space \u2022 \naround the orbital path   : magnetic or electric  fi eld, atmospheric density,    or gravity    \ngradient.  \n  The observable is going to be \u201cremotely sensed   \u201d but it is located over the surface \u2022 \nof the body that the satellite is orbiting.  \n  The observable is going to be remotely sensed    and it is far away in the deep space   .    \u2022 \n\n Each one of these three situations will produce very different interrelations between \nthe observable and the orbit. This is going to be discussed in the next section. \n\n The features of the remote sensing    instruments    will depend on the wavelength    and \nintensity of the radiation being measured. In the particular case of Hipparcos, the \ninstrument was a telescope    that allowed the determination of angular distances \nbetween stars, by combining over a common focal plane    the images of stars located \nwith quite different angular positions.  \n\n   2     http://directory.eoportal.org/pres_CoriolisWindSat.html      \n   3     http://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPadmaeolus.html      \n   4   Hipparcos in ESA Achievements, SP-250.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://directory.eoportal.org/pres_CoriolisWindSat.html\nhttp://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPadmaeolus.html\n\n\n151Introduction to the Design Domains\n\n    7.1.2.   The orbit and attitude domain    \n\n In the case of observables measured in situ   , the requirements for the orbit are clear: \nthe orbital path    shall travel through all the areas of interest    to the consumer   . For these \nkinds of situations the satellite\u2019s attitude is somewhat independent of the observable, \nand it can be selected according to other criteria. For example, the attitude of the \nUlysses    mission (Section   8.3.5     and   9.6.2    ), which monitors the electric and magnetic \n fi elds around the Sun   , was driven by the need to point the satellite\u2019s high-gain com-\nmunication antenna    toward Earth   . \n\n In cases where the observable will be \u201cremotely sensed   \u201d but is located above the \nsurface of the body that the satellite is orbiting, the selection of the orbit will auto-\nmatically determine:\n\n   The distance to the observable  \u2022 \n  The areas that can be observed from the satellite\u2019s orbit    \u2022 \n\n This is the case of all remote sensing    Earth    observation satellites, and generates a \nvery strong interaction between orbit selection and data quality and quantity. The \ndistance to the observable   , that is, the orbit altitude   , will drive the level of quality, \nspatial resolution,    and radiometric accuracy    of the information. The areas under the \norbit as the satellite proceeds along its orbital path    will determine the coverage pro-\nvided by the instruments   . In these kinds of missions the orbit altitude and the instru-\nment characteristics need mutual adjustment to reach a reasonable compromise. \n\n In the case the payload\u2019s  fi eld of view    of the satellite would be pointing    toward \nEarth   , as the satellite orbits the Earth, the resulting pointing attitude will rotate with \nrespect to the inertial space    at the speed of one turn per orbital period   . In cases where \nsystematic coverage is needed, the satellite will be continuously pointing down \ntowards the Earth. In cases where the mission requires swift and repeated coverage \nof speci fi c areas, the attitude of the satellite should change, in order to allow the \ninstrument to be directed for as long as possible at the desired targets; this means that \nthe satellite must be agile. \n\n In astronomical missions, the observable    is at a much greater distance than the \nbody being orbited. In this case, the orbit selected must offer uninterrupted visibility \nof the celestial sphere    where the observable is located. If the mission involves phases \nwhere a large sector of deep space    is surveyed or mapped, followed by a phase of \npointing    toward a number of preselected celestial objects, the spacecraft\u2019s attitude \ncontrol    must cater for these quite different sets of requirements   . Particular attention \nmust be paid throughout the mission to avoid pointing sensitive instrument detectors \nat the Sun    or Moon    that could damage the sensors. In astronomical missions, the \nattitude of the satellite will be determined by the need to point in the direction being \nobserved, while maintaining an adequate  fi eld of view    for communications with Earth    \nand for receiving electric power    from the Sun. This generates a strong link between \nthe orbit and attitude domain    and the con fi guration domain   . It is important to keep in \nmind that as soon as the orbit is selected, the resulting space environment   , for exam-\nple, atmospheric drag    or radiation levels, has also been determined. \n\n The selection of the mission\u2019s orbit and attitude is one of the earliest and most \nfundamental decisions of the mission design process   . As can be seen in Figure  7.1 , it \nis also the design decision richest in interfaces. The selection of the orbit is chie fl y \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n152 Introduction to Space Systems\n\ndriven by the observables    and by the instrument, but is also strongly allied with \nlauncher    selection, with the satellite\u2019s con fi guration,    and with the number and loca-\ntion of ground stations   , both operational and instrument downlink ground stations.  \n\n    7.1.3.   The satellite con fi guration domain    \n\n The physical shape of the satellite is its con fi guration   . The con fi guration is strongly \ndetermined by two requirements:\n\n   The need to provide in orbit the right observing geometry for all of the satellite\u2019s \u2022 \ncomponents: instruments, antennae, thermal radiators, and solar arrays     \n  The need to provide structural support during assembly and launch    \u2022 \n\n This drives two con fi gurations: a stowed con fi guration    on-ground and during \nlaunch, and a deployed con fi guration    in orbit. \n\n In orbit the instruments    will require not only an adequate line of sight    to the \nobserved targets, but also a proper view of cold space    for heat dissipation   . \nElectromagnetic emitters and receivers either for satellite communications or detec-\ntion of observables    also potentially interact with each other, so it is often necessary \nto place them as far away as possible. The position and orientation of the solar array    \nmust also be adequate for acquiring the necessary amount of solar energy in all \nphases of the mission. Governed by the need of electrical power, the satellite\u2019s solar \narray is frequently very large, which in turn requires speci fi c deployable mechanisms   . \nThe volume allocated to the satellite by the launcher    strongly limits the satellite\u2019s \ncon fi guration   . When stowed inside the launcher the satellite\u2019s con fi guration is driven \nby the need for adequate strength   , stiffness,    and compactness, providing the required \ndynamic clearance from the inside of the launcher\u2019s payload fairing   . When deployed, \nthe con fi guration is driven by the need for open  fi elds of view and separation or isola-\ntion. The size of the satellite\u2019s main body is frequently smaller than the necessary \ndistance of separation. In that case it is essential to provide specialized deployable \nstructures    that provide the necessary separation. To cope with the demanding \nmechanical environment generated by the launcher, the satellite\u2019s con fi guration must \ninclude a structural skeleton, which provides strength and stiffness during launch. \nSatellites are normally attached to the tip of the launcher; therefore, the satellite on \nthe launcher will be in effect a cantilevered beam. The on-ground environment also \nin fl uences the con fi guration design; assembly, veri fi cation, testing, and transportation \ngenerate their own environments that the satellite structure must be able to withstand, \nincluding transportation by land, sea, or air. The con fi guration of a particular satellite \nis also sometimes strongly in fl uenced by programmatic constraints   , such as the desire \nto retain modularity of payload and platform, any need to adopt a preexisting plat-\nform, or multiple launch constraints, which may impose accommodation restrictions. \nOther technical issues are the need to limit longitudinal and lateral center of gravity    \nposition at launch, which in turn drives internal equipment accommodation; access \nfor installing and removal of units at any stage of on-ground assembly; platform sen-\nsor and antenna  fi elds of view, thruster accommodation and thrust    vectors; and \ndeployed stiffness and nonnominal thermal design    scenarios. The location and  fi eld \nof view    for communication antennae    is also a design driver. \n\n\n\n153Introduction to the Design Domains\n\n The satellite attitude    strongly impacts the con fi guration    concept. It is instructive to \ncompare the con fi guration of two satellites with the same orbit and purpose, but with \ndifferent attitude control    approaches, for example, the three axes-stabilized American \nGOES and the rotation-stabilized European MSG   . The con fi guration of these satel-\nlites is totally different. GOES and MSG are operational meteorology    Earth    observa-\ntion    missions and both have geostationary orbits   . As can be seen in Figure  7.2 , GOES \nis a cube with six faces. In the inertial space   , it rotates once per orbit around the axis, \nperpendicular to the orbit: \n\n   The Nadir    face, which points continuously toward Earth   , is where the Earth \u2022 \nobserving instrument should be located. It must provide space for the payloads, \nsounder, and imager, and for the communication antennae   , S-, and L-bands, also \npointing    towards Earth.  \n  The two faces parallel to the orbital plane   . They are perpendicular to the Nadir    \u2022 \ndirection, and to the solar array    rotation axis   . Both faces avoid direct illumination \nby the Sun   . One accommodates the solar array drive mechanism, and the other the \nradiators required for cooling    the instruments    as well as the satellite as a whole.  \n  Another face accommodates the interface with the launcher   .    \u2022 \n\n MSG    rotates at 100 rpm around the axis perpendicular to the orbit. This provides \na strong gyroscopic inertia    for this direction, and good pointing    performance. Due to \nthe rotation, there is no Nadir    direction and the satellite has a cylindrical symmetry    \nwith top, bottom, and sides:\n\n   As the spacecraft spins, its sides scan the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis   , \u2022 \nwhich roughly coincides with the plane where the Earth    and Sun    are located. The \ninstruments    and the solar cells    are located on these sides and they sequentially \nscan the Earth and the Sun. This allows the instrument to observe the Earth and \nthe cells to acquire solar energy from the Sun.  \n\n  Figure 7.2.

Both faces avoid direct illumination by the Sun   . \nOne accommodates the communication antennae    with the Earth   , and the other the \nradiators required for cooling    the instruments    as well as the satellite as a whole. \nThe communication antennae number and location are designed and controlled to \ncompensate for the rotation of the satellite keeping always the satellite sending the \ninformation toward the Earth (Figure     7.3 ).      \n\n    7.1.4.   The satellite operations data  fl ow domain    \n\n This domain deals with the functions that the end-to-end space system must perform \nin order to operate correctly, and with the technologies and devices used to ful fi ll \nthese functions. This domain includes both the in-orbit and on-ground elements. At \nsatellite level, this domain is driven by the nature of the observable, by the instrument \nused to observe it, and by the electronic architecture of the instrument and the plat-\nform. At ground segment    level this domain is driven by the instrument and platform \noperations concept and the resulting operational requirements   , which are also driven \nby the nature of the observables   . \n\n The elements that are included in this domain are the traditional satellite on-board \ndata handling    and electric power    components, the satellite-to-ground, and ground-to-\nsatellite, on-board communications subsystems, and all the ground-located satellite \ncontrol elements. The satellite operations ground station   s and any data relay satellite    \nis also included in this domain. This domain is strongly tied to the instrument data \n\n  Figure 7.3.

The operational data  fl ow is driven by the need \u2022 \nfor the operation of the instruments: routine or interactive. The instrument data \n fl ow is driven by the requirements of data quantity and speed of delivery.  \n  The operational data  fl ow is bidirectional between ground and satellite. The instru-\u2022 \nment output data  fl ow is unidirectional from satellite to ground.  \n  The operational data  fl ow involves the complex handling of moderate amounts of \u2022 \ndata. The instrument output involves the simpler handling of large amounts of data.  \n  In Earth    observation    missions, albeit not in space sciences missions, both data \u2022 \n fl ows are implemented using different space and ground hardware, and in many \ncases work at different speeds and are speci fi ed at different frequencies.  \n  The processing of the data produced by the instruments    and the satellite operations    \u2022 \nrequire different types of skills and are usually performed by different institutions.    \n\n The interactions between both domains can be seen in Figure  7.4 . On-ground, the \nmost important interaction takes place when the payload processing    center provides \nobservational requests to mission operations   . In the opposite direction, mission \noperations    provide information on the status of the instrument that might be neces-\nsary for the appropriate processing of the instrument output.

Despite the many in-orbit and on-ground components included in \nthis design domain, compared with the complex interrelations and interfaces of the \npreviously considered design domains, the satellite operations design domain is more \nstraight forward, and the design decisions  fl ow top-down without many complica-\ntions. The main drivers are the operational approach to the mission, and the charac-\nteristics of the instrument. There are two possible modes of operation: interactive and \nsystematic. \n\n   Systematic instruments work continuously without requiring frequent ground \u2022 \noperations intervention. This allows for a highly autonomous operational data  fl ow    \nwith rare human intervention.  \n  Interactive, observatory-like, instruments requiring the handling of user requests to \u2022 \nobserve speci fi c targets. The resulting observing schedules can change frequently \nand even suddenly. This requires intense interaction between space and ground.    \n\n The operational data  fl ow will include the on-board production of the data required \nfor monitoring of the satellite\u2019s status. In nominal conditions the satellite shall be able \nto autonomously handle most events. In nonnominal situations, the satellite shall \ncommunicate the event to ground, and depending on the nature of the nonnominal \nevent, the satellite shall either take autonomous action or wait for ground \ncommands. \n\n Once the operational approach has been established, it becomes necessary to \nadjust the frequency of contacts with the operational ground stations   . This selection \nwill also be driven by the selection of the mission orbit   . Satellite components, like the \non-board data handling computer or the avionics buses, are directly determined by the \nneed to monitor and control the satellite and its instruments. Once the operational \nneeds of the instrument and the platform have been established, electronic monitoring \nand control hardware requirements must be derived, and designs for all these ele-\nments produced.  \n\n    7.1.5.   The instrument output data  fl ow domain    \n\n This domain deals with the functions that the end-to-end space system must perform \nin order to: receive data acquisition requests (if needed), process the acquired data, \nand deliver them to the consumers   . As in Section  7.1.4  above, this domain includes \nboth in-orbit and on-ground elements. As in Section  7.1.4 , the primary driver for this \ndomain is the observable    and instrument needs. The principal design drivers will be \nthe amount of data produced by the instrument, and whether or not there is a need to \nprovide the data to the users within a speci fi ed delivery time. \n\n Included in this domain are all the satellite\u2019s in-orbit components handling instru-\nment data output: processing, storage, modulating, and downlinking. The on-ground \nreception stations, payload processing centers, data distribution networks, and user-\ninterface facilities also form part of this domain. \n\n As in the case of the operational data  fl ow, the requirements derivation process and \nthe resulting design are quite straightforward: the quantity of data produced by the \ninstruments    and the speed-of-delivery requirements, combined with the satellite orbit, \nwill determine the number and location of the ground stations    \u2013 or data relay satellites    \n\n\n\n157Introduction to the Design Domains\n\nif available. Typically, the satellite will downlink the on-board instrument data every \ntime one of the ground stations becomes visible. When the speed of delivery is of \nparamount importance the use of data relay satellites    might be necessary. The instru-\nment data throughput    and the longest period without ground station contact will \ndetermine the on-board data storage needs. Depending on the nature of the data, data \ncompression    hardware might or might not be used. As a rule, advancement of sci-\nences mission data should not be compressed, but operational missions    can tolerate \ndata compression. Depending on mission requirements   , special data processing may \nbe necessary, for example, signal scrambling for security. Finally, the necessary data \ndownlink speed and the space-to-ground link budget    will shape the satellite data \ndownlink hardware. Once ground stations have received the data, it becomes neces-\nsary to determine the main processing steps needed for delivery of the different data \nproducts required by the users. Some users might prefer relatively unprocessed data, \nor to use their own processing schemes, while other users might prefer highly pro-\ncessed data. The processed data must be delivered to the user on time and with a \nguaranteed level of quality. This requires the design of adequate on-ground installa-\ntions to act as an interface with the consumers   . The processing of the data often \nrequires interfaces to external sources of auxiliary data and also the use of data pro-\nduced by other space missions.   \n\n    7.2.   The astronomical observatory missions as an example \nof space system design \n\n The  fl ow down of the requirements and the interrelation between domains has been \ndiscussed in Section  7.1 . The upper part of Figure  7.1  shows that the observable   , the \ninstruments   , the observational approach, the con fi guration,    the orbit, and the attitude \nare strongly interrelated and that it is necessary to arrive to a global architectural \ndesign before it was possible to continue with more detailed design work. This sec-\ntion will expand and explain this  fi rst set of design interactions through the use of \ncommented examples. This section will compare the overall architecture of a number \nof missions, launched at different times but all of the same type. They are all \n\u201cAstronomical Observatory\u201d missions. In these missions a telescope    is launched, and \nastronomers request speci fi c observations. After they have been performed, the \nobservations are downlinked    to the ground, processed, and distributed to the astrono-\nmers that requested them. Such a mission requires:\n\n   High-quality instruments, which normally means large aperture telescopes  \u2022 \n  Extended and uninterrupted periods of observation of the targets  \u2022 \n  An observation direction unobstructed by the Earth   , Moon,    or Sun     \u2022 \n  Fast and easy access by the customer    (astronomers), to observing times and swift \u2022 \ndelivery of the observational results  \n  Fast and  fl exible, ideally interactive, communication from ground to satellite and \u2022 \nfrom satellite to ground  \n  Carefully speci fi ed spacecraft pointing    accuracy   , stability, and control  \u2022 \n  Good thermal and thermoelastic design  \u2022 \n  Long-lasting mission life       \u2022 \n\n\n\n158 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n To illustrate this evolution, the following missions have been selected: IUE   , ISO   , \nHubble   , XMM-Newton   , Herschel,    and JWST   . They encompass an extensive time \nperiod, from the IUE in the 1970s to 2014 when JWST will be launched. The descrip-\ntion of the missions will highlight factors affecting the highest-level design deci-\nsions: orbit selection, basic con fi guration, mission life,    and data  fl ow to and from the \nsatellites. \n\n    7.2.1.   Mission descriptions \n\n    7.2.1.1.   International ultraviolet explorer (IUE   ) \n IUE    5  was a collaborative NASA/ESA project to perform ultraviolet    astronomy with \na 45 cm aperture telescope   . It was launched by a Delta    2914 rocket in 1978 and had \na mission life    of 19 years. It was injected in a geosynchronous    orbit    over the \nAtlantic with 32,050 km of perigee    and 52,254 km of apogee    and it returned \n100,000 ultraviolet spectra from 9,000 celestial bodies. It was the  fi rst satellite oper-\nated  fl exibly to allow astronomers to request fast reaction    observations to targets of \nspecial interest, with provision of the results made available in less than 1 h after \nthe request (Figure  7.5 ).  \n\n It had two centers for receiving requests and for provision of observations: NASA \nGoddard near Washington DC and at Villafranca near Madrid. Both centers also con-\ntrolled the satellite and received and processed the data produced by the telescope. \nDue to the chosen orbit period and location, the satellite was under continuous ground \n\n  Figure 7.5.

The data was \n downlinked    at speeds up to 40 kb/s. With its 19 years of life, IUE    has become one of \nthe longer-lasting satellites ever.  \n\n    7.2.1.2.   Hubble    space telescope \n The Hubble    space telescope is a NASA mission with some ESA collaboration, for \nhigh-quality, general-purpose astronomy from space including: ultraviolet   , visible, \nand infrared    radiation access. It carries a high aperture telescope of 2.4 m of diameter. \nIt was launched by the space shuttle in 1990 to an orbit altitude    of 600 km, and an \ninclination of 28\u00b0. It was designed for in-orbit servicing by astronauts. This allowed \nupgrading of instruments, solar arrays,    and electronics. It remains in orbit and has \nbeen serviced  fi ve times by astronauts, including in-orbit repair of optics, renewal of \nthe solar array,    and updating of electronics (Figure  7.6 ).  \n\n The Space Telescope Science Institute (STSCI), located in Baltimore, is respon-\nsible for the scienti fi c operation of the telescope    and the delivery of data products to \nthe astronomers. The daily satellite monitoring and the management of the in-orbit \nsatellite and instrument operations are in the hands of NASA Goddard, which pro-\nvides this service 24 h per day. 6  Astronomers can apply for time on the telescope, \ncalls for proposals are issued annually, and proposals are either selected or rejected, \nas the demand for time is between six to nine times that available. It is also possible \nto request special \u201ctarget of opportunity\u201d periods, when the observation of important \ntransient events requires a swift reaction. \n\n The visibility of the celestial sphere    from Hubble   \u2019s orbit is strongly hampered \nby the Sun    and the Earth   . To prevent the Sun entering the telescope   , there is a point-\ning    avoidance angle of 45\u00b0 half-cone around the Sun. The telescope\u2019s low-Earth \norbit    also means that the Earth obscures almost half the celestial sphere. There is a \n\n  Figure 7.6.

Due to the inclination of the orbit \nand the resulting precession   , the location of this zone moves slowly around the \ncelestial sphere with a period of 8 weeks. \n\n Hubble    data is stored on the spacecraft. When launched, storage facilities con-\nsisted of reel-to-reel tape recorders, but these were replaced by solid-state data stor-\nage facilities during two servicing missions. From the onboard storage facilities, data \nis transferred to ground via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS    7 ), \nlocated in the Geostationary orbit    and designed so that satellites in low-Earth    orbit    \ncan communicate with their mission control    facilities during 85 % of the orbit. \nTDRSS can provide data rates from 2 to 48 Mb/s, but this system has to be shared \nwith other missions, including highest-priority manned missions. The data is trans-\nmitted from the GEO    located TDRSS satellites to its ground station in White Sands \nNew Mexico and then to the Goddard Space Flight Center that links it to the STSCI \nin Baltimore for processing and distribution to the users.  \n\n    7.2.1.3.   Infrared space observatory (ISO   ) \n ISO    8  was an ESA mission performing infrared    astronomy in the 2.5-240  m m range \nand employing a telescope    with a 60 cm aperture. It was launched by an Ariane    44-P \nin 1998 to a geosynchronous    orbit    with 1,038 km of perigee    and 70,578 km of apo-\ngee   . It had a design life of 18 months\u2014limited by the depletion speed of the 2,100 l \nof He at 1.8 K used to cool the telescope. The actual duration of the He supply in orbit \nwas 28 months. It was able to provide good quality observation when located above \nthe Earth   \u2019s radiation belt   , which occurred during 17 of its 24-h orbit. It was operated \nas an astronomical observatory    with reception of requests and delivery of the \nrequested observations, and had two ground centers that controlled the satellite and \ninterfaced with the consumers   : the primary one located at Villafranca, near Madrid \nprovided visibility during 12 of the 17 theoretically available hours for observation, \nwhile the secondary center, located at Goldstone California, allowed observation dur-\ning the remaining 5 h. During its lifetime the satellite performed 26,000 individual \nobservations. The satellite\u2019s data rate was 33 kb/s from which 24 kb/s where available \nfor instrument output data and the rest for the monitoring of the satellite \n(Figure  7.7 ).   \n\n    7.2.1.4.   XMM-Newton    \n XMM-Newton    is an ESA mission whose aim is to perform astronomical observation \nin the X-ray part of the spectrum in the energy range between 20 nm and 0.1 nm. It \nhas three grazing incidence telescopes, each one with 0.7 m of aperture. Each tele-\nscope    has its mirror module \u2013 made up of 58 concentric mirrors \u2013 and its focal plane   . \nIt was launched in 1999 using an Ariane    5 rocket. The satellite was put into a highly \nelliptic    orbit    with 7,365 km of perigee    and 113,774 km of apogee   , an inclination of \n38.9\u00b0 and with an orbital period    of 48 h. The mission was still operating correctly in \n2009. The satellite has no on-board storage memory and observations are down \n\n   7     www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/programs/tdrss/default.cfm      \n   8   ESA Achievements, BR-250, ESA 2005.  \n\nhttp://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/programs/tdrss/default.cfm\n\n\n161Introduction to the Design Domains\n\nlinked at 70 kb/s in real time to stations at Perth (Australia), Kourou (French Guiana), \nand Santiago (Chili). Observations are possible for up to 40 h of the 48 h of the orbit \nperiod when the satellite is above Earth   \u2019s radiation belts   . \n\n Newton time for observation is divided in four categories:\n\n   Open time that is accessible by regular open announcement of opportunity to the \u2022 \nworldwide scienti fi c community.  \n  There is \u201cdiscretionary time\u201d \u2013 about 5 % of the overall time \u2013 that the XMM-\u2022 \nNewton    Project Scientist can grant discretionary. Within this discretionary time \nthere is \u201ctarget of opportunity\u201d time for observations, which could not have been \nforeseen at the time of the deadline of the announcement of opportunity.  \n  There is a calibration    time \u2013 also about 5 % of the overall time \u2013 for calibration ad \u2022 \nhealth monitoring and control of the satellite and instrument. 9     \n\n Normally XMM is operated in a preplanned manner. Thus all observations must \nbe speci fi ed in full detail well in advance by the proposers (Figure  7.8 ).   \n\n    7.2.1.5.   Herschel    \n Herschel    10  is an ESA mission whose aim is to perform astronomical observations for \nthe  fi rst time in the far infrared    range between 100 and 600  m m. It has a large aperture \ntelescope    with a diameter of 3.5 m. It was launched in May 2009 using an Ariane    5 \nrocket. The launch was shared with another ESA mission: the Planck satellite. Both \nsatellites were put into a halo orbit    around the L2    Lagrangian    po   int. The orbit is \nheliocentric   , and located 1.2\u20131.8 million km from Earth   . The anticipated mission life    \nis 3 years. As in the case of ISO   , the instrument life is limited by the depletion rate \nof the 2,160 l of He at 1.65 K used for cooling   . The satellite stores the information \nproduced by the instrument in a 25 Gbit on-board solid-state memory (Figure  7.9 ).  \n\n  Figure 7.7.

Schotel, ESA 2005.  \n   10   ESA Achievements, BR-250, ESA 2005.  \n\n \n\n\n\n162 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n The stored information is downlinked    at 1.5 Mb/s to a ground station in Perth, \nAustralia, for up to 3 h per day. The satellite is operated from Darmstadt, Germany, \nand the data is distributed from Villafranca, near Madrid. NASA will run a parallel \ndistribution center located at Caltech to serve US astronomers.  \n\n    7.2.1.6.   The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST   ) \n JWST    is a NASA mission with ESA participation. It will be, like the Hubble    Space \nTelescope, for which it is the replacement instrument, a general-purpose astronomical \ntelescope   , but designed to specialize in observing the infrared    spectral region. Its \naperture diameter will be 6.5 m. An Ariane    5 ECA will launch it in 2014 into a helio-\ncentric    halo orbit    around the Lagrangian    L2    point   . Its distance to the Earth    will vary \nfrom 1.2 to 1.8 million km with a periodicity of 6 months. The satellite is designed \n\n  Figure 7.9.

This long life is made possible by the \nuse of a sophisticated Sun   -shield system. Its design and objectives make the use of \nliquid He    for cooling    unnecessary (Figure  7.10 ).  \n\n The 11  Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) will provide communications between the \nmission  fl ight operating center and the JWST   , using the 34 m diameter antennae of \nthe Deep Space Network (DSN) located in California, Spain, and Australia. The DSN \nwill support a command uplink    rate in S band of 16 kb/s, a real-time S band telemetry    \ndownlink    rate of 40 kb/s, and Ka band high-rate telemetry downlinked    at 28 Mbps \nthat is able to downlink up to 232 Gbits of recorded telemetry data in a single 4-h \ncontact per day. The satellite operations    and data utilization    approach will be identical \nto Hubble   \u2019s. The Space Telescope Sciences Institute in Maryland will act as interface \nwith the consumers    and will receive and process the data gathered by the DSN. \n\n The JWST   \u2019s con fi guration    is dominated by a large sun shield    intended to block \nradiation from the Sun    as well as from the Earth    and Moon   . This ensures that the \ntelescope    operates protected from the radiation of the Sun and thereby keeps its sensi-\ntive optics cold enough to meet its mission objectives.   \n\n    7.2.2.   Comparison of the missions \n\n These missions have many things in common, and there are similarities in their \nimplementation. Nevertheless, many mission elements are different. Below, we will \nanalyze the similarities and differences between them, and extract lessons from the \nanalysis. \n\n  Figure 7.10.

Instrument and con fi guration \n All the physical con fi gurations are driven by the need to accommodate the instru-\nment: the telescope   . It requires support during launch, as well as for pointing    it once \nin orbit. The con fi guration    must be able to point at targets while making sure to avoid \nthe Sun    and the Earth   . The con fi guration must also allow the solar array    to point \ntoward the Sun, and the communication antennae    to point in the right direction \ntoward Earth. The con fi guration must be as compact as possible to allow moderate \ninertia and high rigidity for fast maneuverability between targets and to allow for easy \nstorage inside the volume provided by the launcher   . \n\n In all these missions the telescope    sits right on top of the satellite platform   . This \nprovides all the satellites with a cylindrical symmetry    during launch that  fi ts nicely in \nthe cylindrical space provided by the launcher and offers a high capacity for with-\nstanding loads from all sources down the telescope, to the platform and to the inter-\nface with the launcher   . In orbit and to protect the telescope from solar light entering \ndirectly into the telescope perturbations, it will be also necessary to establish an \nexclusion area de fi ned by the highest Sun    angles that the telescope can tolerate. To \ncope with these Sun angle limitations the satellite is forced to point the telescope to \nthe targets located on the celestial sphere    by rolling around the Sun direction. That \nmeans, in-orbit, the Sun will be always inside a cone de fi ned by the satellite-Sun \ndirection (Figure  7.11 ).  \n\n In all cases but one \u2013 the JWST    \u2013 the sightline of the telescope    is along the longi-\ntudinal axis of the launcher   . This is by far the simplest way to accommodate the \ntelescope in the launcher, but the aperture of the telescope is limited by the diameter \nof the launcher\u2019s payload fairing    envelope.

This \npermits the 6.5 m diameter of the aperture to  fi t within the 4.5 m diameter provided \nby Ariane    5, but a series of complex deployment mechanisms    are necessary to attain \nthe operational satellite con fi guration   . The structure of JWST can be seen also in \nFigure   10.18    . \n\n Telescopes that work in the infrared   : ISO   , Herschel,    and JWST   , need special pro-\ntection from the heat and light generated by the Sun    or Earth   . In these cases, either \nthe solar arrays    act also as Sun shields \u2013 as for ISO, Herschel \u2013 or dedicated deploy-\nable sun shields are needed, as is the case for JWST. Telescopes working with more \nenergetic radiation, like Hubble   , IUE,    and XMM-Newton   , do not have this limitation; \nthey do not need a Sun-shield    and can use conventional solar arrays that are deployed \nfrom the satellite platform   .  \n\n    7.2.2.2.   Orbits \n The observables    of these types of missions are extremely remote, so the distance to \nthe observable is essentially the same for all orbits, although Hubble    is sometimes \ntasked with solar system    imaging. Therefore, the orbit will be determined by the vis-\nibility of the observables by the telescope   , the avoidance of the Sun   , and the  fl exibility \nof the communications with Earth   . The ideal orbit is an orbit far away from Earth and \nwith a predictable geometry with respect to the Sun. This orbit allows days and even \nweeks of observing time in a speci fi c direction of space unmolested by the Earth or \nthe Sun. It seems that the ideal orbit would be a heliocentric    orbit    around a Lagrangian    \npoint   . JWST    and Herschel    indeed  fl y around the Lagrangian L2    point   . In this orbit the \nSun and the Earth are in roughly the same direction, and measures taken to protect \nthe telescope from the visibility of one will serve as well for the other. This location \nalso serves to avoid the thermal transient    environment experienced by spacecraft in \nlow-Earth orbits. Nonetheless, this orbit needs large launchers to reach the orbit, as \nwell as powerful communication antennae    to send and receive information from L2, \nwhich is up to 1.8 million km distant from Earth. This is the reason why older mis-\nsions did not employ this orbit. \n\n Geosynchronous    orbits    are also good because they provide prolonged contact with \nthe same ground station and permit close to a day of observation without serious \ninterference by the Earth    or Sun   , while allowing the employment of the large selec-\ntion of launchers that are optimized for communications missions on geostationary \norbits   . This was the orbit chosen by IUE    and ISO   . IUE\u2019s orbit allowed continuous \noperations because its path passed directly above Earth\u2019s radiation belts   . ISO and \nXMM, on the other hand, had highly elliptic    orbits    that forced the payload to switch \noff during several hours per day \u2013 when the mission was inside Earth\u2019s radiation belt   . \nIn the case of ISO this alternative was chosen to optimize the total mission duration, \nwhich was limited by the amount of He coolant on-board: it was more ef fi cient to \nhave a larger amount of He in the highly elliptical orbit    than a smaller amount in an \norbit that would permit continuous operation of the telescope    but would have required \na larger amount of fuel. In the case of XMM, the limitation imposed by the launcher    \nalso made it advisable to choose a highly elliptical orbit, which interrupts observa-\ntions for just a few hours every 2 days, than to circularize the orbit to permit com-\npletely uninterrupted instrument use. Final orbit selection is always in fl uenced by \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n166 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nnumerous factors, including: maximizing the time available for uninterrupted obser-\nvations of a speci fi c target, long mission lifetime, long instrument operating duty \ncycle, satellite operational  fl exibility, and launch constraints. 12  \n\n The trend of the 1980s in favor of in-orbit servicing and shuttle use forced the \nHubble    to choose an orbit accessible to the space shuttle. This resulted in several very \npositive consequences. Astronaut servicing enabled repairs to be made to the tele-\nscope    as well as for the upgrading of the solar array   , the processing electronics   , gyros, \nthermal insulators, battery, and the mass memory. Nevertheless, the chosen orbit \ncomes with some strings attached; because it adds the limitations inherent in avoiding \nEarth   , which at such a low orbit, hides almost one half of the celestial sphere   , to the \nunavoidable limitations of avoiding the Sun   . The problem of contact with Earth was \nsolved by the use of the real-time TDRSS    communication system. However, Hubble \nshares the TDRSS system with the manned International Space Station, which has \npriority over Hubble, limiting the operational  fl exibility that the use of TDRSS would \nhave promised. Hubble\u2019s  fi nal lifespan will be close to 20 years, which is testimony \nto the advantages of in-orbit servicing allowing its sensors to take advantage of \nsigni fi cant improvements in technology since the original detectors were designed. \nNevertheless, IUE    has survived 18 years of operations, even though it was designed \nfor just 5 years of life, and the next generation of observatory satellites is designed to \nlast for 10 years or more. Hence, a properly designed satellite of this type is likely to \nhave a very long actual life.  \n\n    7.2.2.3.   Attitude \n The telescope    shall be able to point to the different targets that could be located any-\nwhere in the celestial sphere   . As far as satellite in-orbit attitude is concerned, the \nsatellites are all inertially stabilized    and must be operated by pointing    the whole satel-\nlite    in the direction of the target to be observed. In all cases the communication \nantenna is located on the satellite platform    and points toward Earth   . The Earth\u2019s \ndirection changes as the satellite  fl ies along its orbit. To decouple the pointing of the \nantenna and the pointing of the telescope the communication antenna has to be \npointable. \n\n The pointing    of the telescope   \u2019s opening toward the Sun    must be avoided and the \nsatellite can only maneuver by rolling around this direction. The Sun\u2019s direction \nrotates in the inertial space    once per year and in order for observations to be per-\nformed, it is necessary to wait until the Sun is on the platform side of the Sun-shield    \nand the target on the telescope side of the sun-shield. In the case of JWST   , the Sun-\nshield protects the instrument when its line of sight   , and thus the satellite attitude   , is \nlocated within a \u00b125\u00b0 belt perpendicular to the direction of the Sun 13  (Figure  7.12 ). \nThis de fi nes a 50\u00b0 functional line-of-sight    sector between 85\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 from the \nsatellite-Sun direction. The region of the sky near the celestial north and south poles \nis continuously accessible. The medium latitudes are accessible during a long single \n\n   12   XMM Overview, H.

Regions that are \nnear the ecliptic plane    are reachable during two yearly seasons of 51 days, separated \nby two seasons of 131 days when they are inaccessible. As explained in Section  7.2 , \nopportunities for observation of the different requested targets are allocated by a mis-\nsion observation plan    elaborated on the ground that has to take into account the sea-\nsonal opportunities provided by the Sun-satellite-observable geometry.   \n\n    7.2.2.4.   Operations and utilization \n It might have seemed beforehand that rapid and direct access to the observatory by \nthe consumer    would be essential; however, this is not the case, for two reasons:\n\n   In real life the available observation time is limited and the observation requests \u2022 \nfar exceed the available time. The establishment of a \u201cpeer review\u201d process acting \nas gatekeeper for the telescope    and adjudicating the available time to the worthiest \nrequests is compulsory.  \n  The complex observing geometry, which is a function of the seasons, and the need \u2022 \nto balance the different observation requests make it necessary to create a long-\nterm \u201cseasonal\u201d observing plan to optimize the satellite\u2019s use while respecting the \nsatellite\u2019s visibility constraints. It is not possible always to observe anywhere.    \n\n From time to time mission coordinators offer an \u201cAnnouncement of Opportunities,\u201d \nthrough which the users community can convey their wishes. After a  fi ltering pro-\ncess, a number of observational initiatives commensurate with the available time are \nselected and are scheduled for the appropriate period according to their requirements. \nThis results in a long-term satellite observation plan   , which is established well in \nadvance of the actual observations. This plan consumes a large chunk of the avail-\nable observation time. At the same time, all missions include a \u201cfast track\u201d contin-\ngency plan, in case an unexpected and important astronomical event should require \n\nSun \n\nTar\nget\n\npoi\nntin\n\ng b\nand\n\nRoll rotation\naxis for\n\npointing\nmanoeuvres\n\nSun\nshield 20\u00b0\n\n50\u00b0\n\n5\u00b0\n\nT\nel\n\nes\nco\n\npe\n a\n\nxi\ns\n\nTelescope axis\n\nT\nar\n\nge\nt p\n\noi\nnt\n\nin\ng \n\nba\nnd\n\n \n\nF\nor\n\nbi\ndd\n\nen\nse\n\nct\nor\n\n \n\nF\nor\n\nbi\ndd\n\nen\n s\n\nec\nto\n\nr \n\nSun \n\nRoll rotation\naxis for\n\npointing\nmanoeuvres\n\nTelescope allowable pointing range \nTarget pointing reachable band over the\ncelestial sphere around the satellite in a\n\nsatellite centered reference frame\n\nTarget \n\n  Figure 7.12.

In July 2009, Hubble    was commanded to \nimage the impact of an asteroid on Jupiter    within hours. In general, the operational \nscenario for astronomical observation missions is complex, and the creation of obser-\nvation schedules is an important planning task for the mission. These schedules must \nbe rigid enough to maximize the time allocated for observation but  fl exible enough \nto accommodate unexpected events. Scheduling is achieved through close interac-\ntion between the astronomers and the engineers in charge of the satellite\u2019s \noperations. \n\n As we can see, uninterrupted communication with the satellite is desirable, though \nnot compulsory. Older missions, such as IUE    and ISO   , did indeed maintain continu-\nous communication with Earth    while their instruments were operational. They \nrequired no large on-board memory for storing instrument-produced data because \ndata was downlinke   d as it was produced. This afforded the missions a large opera-\ntional  fl exibility. IUE was actually operational for 24 h a day, while ISO was opera-\ntional only during the period of 17 h a day when the instrument was above the Van \nAllen    radiation belts   . Both missions employed two ground stations   , one in America \nand the other in Europe. \n\n Hubble   , which was using the TDRSS    data communication network, featured a \ntotally different overall data  fl ow that would have allowed a continuous and real-time \ndata dialog with the satellite, but the need to share the TDRSS network with other \nusers \u2013 like the International Space Station \u2013 and the need to review and agree on \nobservations, produced a system that is identical to all the others as regards the \nattending and processing of astronomers\u2019 requests. During periods when the TDRSS \nis not available for Hubble\u2019s use, the satellite uses its on-board memory to store data. \nAstronauts upgraded the telescope   \u2019s memory from tape-based to the much more \n fl exible solid-state variety. We have seen that the availability of large capacity on-\nboard mass memories permits the reduction of expensive and long contacts with \nground stations   . The future JWST    and Herschel    will be in contact with ground sta-\ntions for just a few hours a day. This will reduce the use of ground stations and the \nmission\u2019s overall cost    while still allowing enough  fl exibility for satellite operations    \nwhile providing almost uninterrupted instrument operations. The technical advance-\nment offered by on-board mass memory has produced a next generation of missions \nthat do not need continuous contact with Earth   .  \n\n    7.2.2.5.   Satellite life and mission life \n The need for astronomical observatories is continuous. Ideally a constant  fl ow of \nmissions would be able to provide uninterrupted observing capabilities in the differ-\nent parts of the spectrum. However, this has not been the case. Still, astronomers \nhave enjoyed a continuous  fl ow of observatory missions that have provided a quite \nreasonable long-term coverage of needs with increasingly better instruments. This \nincrease in quality can be clearly seen by comparing ISO   \u2019s 0.6 m of aperture with \nthe 3.3 m of Herschel   , or Hubble   \u2019s 2 m with the 6.5 m of JWST   . It can be argued that \nall these missions are actually a system of systems    providing complementary \nobserving capabilities to advance our understanding of astronomy. This \u201cunplanned\u201d \n\n\n\n169Introduction to the Design Domains\n\n continuity is a result of the considerable current operational life    \u2013 much longer than \ndesigned for \u2013 of all the missions listed here, coupled with the political pressure \napplied by consumers    on sponsors to ensure new projects are approved. Nonetheless, \nastronomers\u2019 political muscle has been inadequate to the task of obtaining a long-\nterm formal commitment to continuity on the part of politicians, though they are \ngetting closer to that goal. \n\n ISO    had a limited life due to the reliance upon the  fi nite supply of He used as \ncooler. JWST   , which observes similar phenomena, uses sophisticated deployment \nmechanisms    to allow a much longer mission life   . The advantages of the longer life \nare paid for with a complicated con fi guration    that will be discussed in detail in \nSection   10.3.3    . \n\n It is worth emphasizing that the actual life of these missions exceeded all expecta-\ntions. Both IUE    and Hubble    will end up having lasted for nearly 20 years.   \n\n    7.2.3.   Observatory mission highest-level design interactions \n\n The previous two sections analyzed the fundamental design decisions of several \nastronomical observatory    missions   . This section will supplement that analysis by \nproviding an introduction to how higher-level requirements and design decisions \ninterrelate with one another. This introduction will not be exhaustive, but will con-\ncentrates on how design and speci fi cations    relate to image quality and quantity, satel-\nlite size, and instrument pointing    needs. These interrelations are especially complex \nand provide a good illustration of the multiple implications of design decisions. \n\n Figure  7.13  depicts the cascade of interrelations and design decisions generated by \nrequirements regarding data quality and quantity. Mission astronomers will require \nthat the data to be produced be of a speci fi c quality and quantity. These terms are \nstudied closely in Sections   8.4.2     and   8.4.4    , respectively. Here it suf fi ces to say that \nspatial resolution    is the smallest distance between two image features distinguished \nby an instrument, while radiometric resolution is the smallest difference in signal \nintensity measured by the instrument.  \n\n Good spatial and radiometric resolution depends on correctly sensing weak signals \narriving from their limited place of origin. In order to properly detect signals an \ninstrument with a large signal collecting area is needed. This will determine instru-\nment size   , which in turn will in fl uence the satellite\u2019s overall size and mass. The \ndesign implications of instrument and satellite size were thoroughly discussed in \nprevious sections. To avoid image smearing    during the integration period needed for \nacquiring the image, good spatial resolution    demands that the instrument\u2019s line of \nsight    be highly stable. This requires a very precise command of the satellite\u2019s attitude, \nproviding accurate line-of-sight control while avoiding mechanical perturbations   . \nAchieving high pointing    stability    becomes even more dif fi cult in large, heavy, and \n fl exible satellites. The satellite mechanisms   , and the attitude actuators themselves, \nintroduce mechanical pointing perturbations    that alter the instrument\u2019s pointing sta-\nbility. High-resolution astronomical observatories require a strict control of internal \nmechanical perturbations. This could entail the use of active or passive damping \ntechniques, further complicating the design. It is crucial that both the attitude control    \nsystem and any internal sources of mechanical perturbations be speci fi ed so that \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n170 Introduction to Space Systems\n\ninstrument pointing and pointing stability are compatible with the instrument\u2019s \nresolution. \n\n In order to reduce the problems described in the previous paragraphs, it is possible \nto provide strong integrated signals by increasing the total integration time    through \nthe addition of several images of shorter duration. This will relax the instrument size    \nand line-of-sight    stability requirements. Nevertheless, it will increase the instru-\nment\u2019s data throughput    and the time needed to produce each  fi nal observation. This \nintegration time increase will reduce the number of observations produced by the \nmission, with the corresponding reduction in the mission\u2019s value for the astronomers/\nconsumers   . \n\n Consumers    will always prefer the acquisition of as many observations as possible, \nand each one with a large  fi eld of view   . Large  fi elds of view require large and com-\nplex instruments   . The acquisition of a large number of images demands a high level \nof agility    to enable fast repointing    from one target to another. This in turn requires a \npowerful attitude control    system and a stiff satellite. A satellite\u2019s stiffness    and agility \nare in direct contradiction to instrument aperture and satellite size. The use of power-\nful attitude control actuators    is also at variance    with the need for smooth and careful \nattitude control described above. Satellites producing large amounts of data need fast \nand powerful data downlink    subsystems and/or a large number of judiciously located \nground stations    to provide extended periods of contact with the satellite. The proper \nconsideration of pointing perturbations    is an area requiring an architectural perspec-\ntive. Pointing perturbations will be examined in detail in Section   9.8    . The paragraphs \nabove are just an introduction and the interactions discussed in this section will be \nretaken and expanded several times in the Chapters   7    ,   8    ,   9    ,   10    ,   11    , and   12    .   \n\nInstrument integration\ntime \n\nInstrument data\nthroughput \n\nLine of sight\nstability \n\nSpatial resolution \n\nRadiometric\nresolution \n\nInstrument aperture \n\nSatellite internal\nperturbations \n\nSatellite size \n\nSatellite internal mechanical\ndisturbances\n\nAttitude\npointing\n\nrequirements\n\nAttitude stability\nrequirements \n\nAttitude agility\nand\n\nmaneuvering speed\n\nSatellite stiffness \nData Quantity =\n\n\u2018Number of images to\nbe taken\u2019 ! field of\n\nview of each image\n\nData Downlink\nSpeed Ground stations\n\nnumber and location\n\nMulti image\naddition \n\nActive or passive disturbances\ncontrol techniques\n\ntelescope size \n\nSatellite mass \n\n  Figure 7.13.

Multi-satellite design aspects \n\n There are design decisions regarding the number of satellites required to ful fi ll a \n mission\u2019s objectives as the same requirements    can be ful fi lled by one, several, or \nmany satellites. Examples are:\n\n   One communication satellite in a geostationary orbit can provide continuous com-\u2022 \nmunication services to the users in a given region on Earth   . A constellation of \nsatellites in low-Earth orbit   , like Iridium   , (Section   9.6.3     and   10.3.4    ) can be \ndesigned to provide continuous communication over the whole Earth.  \n  A small number of satellites \u2013 or just one \u2013 carrying instruments    with large  fi elds \u2022 \nof view will provide similar observing capability than a large number of satellites \nwith correspondingly smaller  fi elds of view.  \n  A larger number of cheaper satellites with lower reliability and shorter mission life    \u2022 \nwill provide similar length of service than a smaller number of more expensive \nsatellites with higher reliability and longer individual satellite lives.    \n\n In some cases \u2013 like the geostationary example provided above \u2013 the selection of \nthe number of satellites is related to the selection of the orbit but in the other two \ncases mentioned, the constellation of satellites will travel along very similar or identi-\ncal orbits. \n\n Satellites collectively providing a service shall have controlled orbital positions; \nthat means, they shall be a constellation; Section   9.11     will concentrate in the design \nand maintenance of constellations   . The present section will study the design drivers \nthat will favor using a larger or smaller number of satellites to provide a similar set \nof performances. \n\n    7.3.1.   Data quantity and quality versus number of satellites \n\n If the mission requirements    can be ful fi lled with a single satellite, the mission is com-\nmonly implemented using a single satellite. Nevertheless, employing several satel-\nlites to provide the same service has a number of advantages:\n\n   It permits smaller, more robust, and simpler instruments and satellites and a lower \u2022 \ndevelopment risk    for the mission. Small robust satellites, using proven technolo-\ngies, can be at the same time cheap and reliable and can be accommodated in \nlower-cost    launchers. Robust satellites have been already discussed in Section \n  5.3.1     and will be discussed again in Section   13.2.4     when discussing low-cost \nsatellites.  \n  The Earth   \u2019s surface is curved and instruments observing regions located far \u2022 \naway from the satellite\u2019s ground track    will see those areas strongly foreshort-\nened or distorted. The use of several satellites each with a small swath instead \nof a single one with a large swath    will allow observation with minimum image \ndistortion.  \n  Each satellite of the constellation will sequentially downlink    the information \u2022 \nstored on-board as they pass over the ground station. This allows a longer and \nmore ef fi cient \u2013 lower speed and longer duration \u2013 downlink of the data produced \nby the missions.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_13\n\n\n172 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  Multiple satellites reduce risk    and make missions more robust with respect to \u2022 \nfailure: the failure of one satellite does not imply the end of the mission but only \na degradation of performances.    \n\n For the same set of programmatic constraints and for the same style of project \norganization, splitting the capabilities of the instrumentation among more than one \nsatellite \u2013 providing that mission requirements    allow this\u2014is more likely to imply an \nincrease rather than a decrease in total mission costs. In the other hand, to provide the \nsame function with multiple satellites would allow the use of mature technology that \ncan be implemented using lean management techniques (Section   13.2.3     and   13.2.4    ) \nand the result could be an overall cost    reduction. \n\n Reducing the size of an instrument reduces its aperture. When an instrument\u2019s \naperture is reduced, not just the quantity but also the quality of the data is reduced. \nUsing \u201csynthetic aperture\u201d techniques where several instruments    are combined may \nsolve this; nevertheless, synthetic aperture methods are not always applicable and they \nentail demanding requirements for controlling the relative positioning of each indi-\nvidual instrument. For many applications it will not be possible to provide the same \nmission data quality with many small instruments instead of a single large one. \n\n As we can see, there are many factors that in fl uence the decision to deploy one or \nmany satellites; the advantages and disadvantages of one or the other implementation \nare  fi nely balanced, and must be carefully weighed for each particular mission. \nRecent history offers examples in favor of all three forms of implementation: single, \ndual, and multiple satellite missions:\n\n   Most missions that can be implemented as a single satellite are implanted that way. \u2022 \nAll the missions described previously in Section  7.2  are implemented using a \nsingle satellite.  \n  RapidEye \u2022 14  consists of  fi ve satellites, each with one small camera providing a \nswath of 70 km and 6.5 m of resolution. Each satellite is simple enough to weigh \njust 150 kg, but combined they provide a very high data production rate and a \npowerful mission performance.  \n  Sentinel-3   \u2019s (Section  \u2022  8.3.3     and   9.6.1    ) initial designs considered both one and two \nsatellite options. The  fi nal decision was for two satellites. This case will be studied \nin detail below.    \n\n Sentinel-3   \u2019s objective is to provide operational information about Earth   \u2019s land and \nocean environment. Ocean observation is made dif fi cult by the Sun   \u2019s high re fl ectance \noff the sea, which negatively impacts image quality when glare from the Sun prevents \ninstrument observation. Consumers    demanded a mission able to provide full glare-\nfree coverage in less than 3 days. For ocean observation, Sentinel-3 features an instru-\nment consisting of several individual cameras. Each camera provides a  fi eld of view    \nof approximately 12\u00b0, and they can be arranged in different con fi gurations. The prob-\nlem was how to arrange the individual cameras to ful fi ll the 3-day revisit    requirement \n\n   14   The RapidEye Spacecraft, Dr George Tyc, Dc Manfred Krischke et al., 4th IAA Symposium on Small \nSatellites for Earth    Observation 2003.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_13\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_13\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n173Introduction to the Design Domains\n\nin the most ef fi cient way. During the de fi nition phase of this mission two alternatives \nwere studied:\n\n   In the  fi rst, six cameras were placed over a  fl at optical bench. In this case, two \u2022 \nsatellites were needed to ful fi ll the 3 days coverage requirement because Sun    glare \nwas polluting observations provided by some of the cameras.  \n  In the second alternative, two pairs of two cameras pointing    30\u00b0 ahead and 30\u00b0 \u2022 \nbehind the Nadir    direction substituted for the two cameras at the center. In this \ncase, one satellite was able to ful fi ll the coverage requirement because either the \ncameras pointing ahead or those pointed behind were free of Sun    glint.    \n\n The use of two pairs of two cameras provided an effective and fast Earth    covering \nsingle satellite mission. Nevertheless, this required the use of a much larger, heavier, \nand complex instrument, since the  fl at optical bench of the six-cameras solution was \nsubstituted by a cross-like three-dimensional optical bench carrying eight cameras. \nThe change increased the instrument length from 0.85 to 1.45 m and also complicated \nthe installation of the calibration    devices and cooling    system. On the other hand, the \ninstrument allowed the mission to ful fi ll the ocean coverage performance in the \n3 days required by the consumers   . One satellite carrying eight cameras was cheaper \nthan two satellites carrying six cameras each. Nevertheless, the  fi nal mission imple-\nmentation favored the simple instrument solution, and two satellites were necessary \nto ful fi ll the 3 days requirement. The complex eight-camera arrangement was judged \ntoo risky and bulky. Furthermore, the simpler solution  fi nally chosen allowed a stag-\ngered implementation of the mission by launching one satellite after another, thus \nensuring a robust mission design (Figure  7.14 ).   \n\nFlat optical bench for 4\ncentral looking cameras\n\nStructure for 2 fore\nlooking cameras\n\nStructure for 2 aft\nlooking cameras\n\n  Figure 7.14.

Mission life versus number of satellites \n\n As we mentioned in Section   4.5    , operational missions    need to last for as long as \npossible because operational missions    ful fi ll permanent societal needs, for instance \nenvironment monitoring    or communications. To determine operational life    it is neces-\nsary to decide how the mission life    is going to be shared between individual satellites. \nOverall mission life must be a clearly de fi ned requirement. It must be determined if \nthe requested mission life is compatible with a single satellite, though there are limits \nto what duration is realistic, and long operational missions are normally implemented \nas a series of satellites. \n\n Figure  7.15  examines the possible implementation for the above-mentioned \nSentinel-3   . Each satellite is speci fi ed as having a reliability of 0.8 after a mission life    \nof 7 years, and of being deorbited after a life of 10 years. Each individual satellite\u2019s \nreliability curve declines over time as its reliability deteriorates. This means launch-\ning replacement satellites (as indicated by the arrow on the horizontal axis) when the \nprobability of a satellite continuing to operate correctly becomes too low. There are \nthree curves for the availability    of at least one, two, and three satellites. For 20 years \nof life (240 months), and six satellites launched during this period, the availability of \nat least two functional satellites being in orbit is always above 0.8, and is higher than \n0.9 during most of the mission, which was the original requirement of the system.  \n\n In real life, well-built satellites frequently have lives well above the guarantied \nvalues provided by reliability calculations. In Section   5.5.6    , this book noted that \nMeteosat 5, 6, and 7, which were designed for an operational life    of 5 years, were still \nfunctional in 2005, having performed for 14, 12, and 8 years, respectively. \nNevertheless, the availability    calculation of Figure  7.15  provides a good overview of \npossibilities, and sheds light on alternative scenarios. The combination of cost    con-\nstraints and the well-established long life enjoyed by satellites ends by advising the \n\n  Figure 7.15.

Meteosat Second Generation, whose  fi rst satellite was launched successfully \nin 2002, will employ three or four satellites to cover the mission\u2019s nominal opera-\ntional life up to the year 2018, and just three Sentinel-3    satellites are foreseen in order \nto provide a system with an operational life of 15 years.   \n\n    7.4.   Systems of systems \n\n The system of systems    approach to analysis and design has been used in defense and \ninformation technology for some time, and it was recently introduced in space system \ndesign for two different purposes:\n\n   The integration and interoperability of existing space assets with each other and \u2022 \nwith ground-based systems, so that together they can provide services that they are \nunable to provide separately. This is more oriented toward the provision of new \nservices with existing space assets.  \n  To move from an asset-oriented system design to a service-oriented design, focus-\u2022 \ning on the requirements from the end-user. This is more oriented to the design and \nprovision of new services with a mixture of new and existing elements.    \n\n The system of systems    approach is especially relevant for dealing with the deliv-\nery of services related to areas such as civil and military security, disaster manage-\nment, and environment monitoring   . Systems of systems approaches offer:\n\n    \u2022 Operational independence : each constituting system can operate in isolation. \nWhen operated in isolation each constituting system is able to ful fi ll a speci fi c set \nof requirements that were the original reasons for creating it.  \n   \u2022 Managerial independence : each constituting system could be designed and imple-\nmented in isolation and could also be actually managed and operated in \nisolation.  \n   \u2022 Evolutionary development : the system of systems   , consisting of independent sys-\ntems, does not appear fully formed. It is not implemented in a single project but \nmade up of existing and new systems that can evolve, disappear, or reappear at any \ntime.  \n   \u2022 Emergent behavior : the system of systems    is able to provide services that none of \nthe independent systems in isolation is able to provide.  \n  Geographic distribution so that the components can interchange only information.    \u2022 \n\n The methodology for the analysis and design of system of systems is based on the \nuse of formal architectural frameworks (Section   2.2.2    ) and formal system description \nlanguages. The aim is to de fi ne the environment in a rigorous way that would allow \nidentifying the problems, mainly those involving information interchange, that would \nbe necessary for providing the required services. The system of systems is imple-\nmented using a combination of new and existing ground and space systems. A proper \nanalysis would be able to provide not only a static view, but an evolving one as well, \nfor indicating how the systems inside the system of systems    will evolve, and what \nmeasures will be necessary to ensure a mid- to long-term delivery of the speci fi ed \nservices. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_2\n\n\n176 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n The overall Earth    observing capability presently in space is one example of a sys-\ntem of systems    as of fi cially recognized by the concept of GEOSS (Global Earth \nObservation System of Systems). 15  Understanding the Earth: its weather, climate, \noceans, atmosphere, water, land, geodynamics, natural resources, ecosystems, and \nnatural and human-induced hazards is crucial, and all the Earth observation    satellites \nin orbit contribute to these tasks. Observations of the Earth constitute critical input \nfor advancing this understanding. The ultimate vision is to realize a system of sys-\ntems that allows decisions related to the environment to be well informed by coordi-\nnated, comprehensive, and sustained Earth observations. GEOSS is made up of all \nexisting independent Earth observation satellites. The overall aim is for each of these \nmissions\u2019 administrators to accept and implement interoperability arrangements cen-\ntered on technical speci fi cations for collecting, processing, storing, and disseminating \nshared data and products by employing agreed-upon standards and data sharing \narrangements. This interoperability would be focused on interfaces in order to mini-\nmize any impact on the affected space missions. \n\n The SSTL DMC    constellation was made up at the beginning of 2010 of six satel-\nlites built and operated by Surrey Satellite (SSTL) and with the following resolutions \nand ownerships:  \n\n Satellite  Owned by  Imager resolution \n\n Deimos-1  Deimos Imaging SA  22 m \n\n UK-DMC2  SSTL  22 m \n\n Beijing-1  BLMIT  32 m, 4 m PAN \n\n UK-DMC     BNSC  32 m \n\n NigeriaSat-1  NASRDA (Nigeria)  32 m \n\n AlSAT-1  CNTS (Algeria)  32 m \n\n Each member of the consortium has an independent satellite imaging capability, \nwhich under the consortium agreement is made available to support common objec-\ntives. All members have signed a nonlegally binding    agreement to make available up \nto 5 % of satellite imaging capacity. Such an original arrangement allows for quite an \nunusual operational approach to the analysis of data. Each satellite of the constella-\ntion provides images of Earth    in three bands with a resolution of 32 m, and several \nboast panchromatic    instruments with resolution up to 4 m. Acting together as a con-\nstellation; these satellites are able to observe any part of the Earth with a mean delay \nof 1 day. It is possible to reschedule these satellites in 24 h (depending on the \nresources available), and the time from imaging to downlink    ranges from 10 min to \n24 h depending on the location of the targets and the ground stations   . The time from \ndata reception to product release varies from 4 h (not orthorecti fi ed) to 48 h \n(orthorecti fi ed using reference control points in the ground to produce subpixel accu-\nracy). All the satellites together have capabilities that they do not have separately and \nDMC    can be also considered a system of systems   .        \n\n   15   GEOSS 10 Years Implementation Plan, The Group in Earth    Observation (GEO   ), ESA BR-240, ESA 2005.  \n\n\n\n177\n\n           Keywords    Instruments Engineering,   Space Instruments Types,   Optical Instruments,  \n Microwave instruments,   Observational Requirements    \n\n This    design domain    was introduced in Section   7.1.1    . This chapter starts with an \nanalysis of the relationship between an instrument and its observables   . It continues \nwith a brief introduction to the types of payloads that are carried by satellites. It con-\ntinues by examining  fi ve space missions:\n\n   ESA\u2019s Earth    observation    satellite Aeolus   , which determines the speed of the wind \u2022 \nin the atmosphere using a Doppler wind laser    as the active element of an optical \ninstrument.  \n  The NASA-ESA astronomy satellite JWST   , which uses an exceptionally large \u2022 \ntelescope    to observe the relatively cold early universe. It carries a passive optical \ninstrument   .  \n  ESA\u2019s mission Sentinel-3   , which carries \u2013 among other devices \u2013 a radar altimetry    \u2022 \ninstrument, which measures sea levels   , permitting derivation of ocean currents. \nThe radar altimeter    is an active microwave instrument   .  \n  The ISRO-CNES tropical water-cycle mission Megha-Tropiques   , which carries \u2022 \ntwo passive microwave radiometers    to study water vapor, cloud properties, and \nprecipitation.  \n  ESA-NASA Sun    magnetosphere    observing mission Ulysses   , which carries a set of \u2022 \nmagnetic and electric  fi eld sensors. These instruments    are in situ    measuring instru-\nments and cannot carry out remote sensing   .    \n\n These  fi ve missions encompass the  fi ve main categories of instruments    used by \nsatellites. They provide a good overview of the kinds of problems associated with the \nimplementation of different instruments. \n\n The chapter continues with the analysis of the observational needs as design driv-\ners and what type of features instruments    should have to produce good data. The next \nsection of the chapter covers the end-to-end performances   , providing examples of \nhow complex it is to determine the \u201c fi nal\u201d performance of the instruments and of the \nspace mission carrying them. \n\n The correct allocation of functions    is one of the two fundamental mechanisms for \nachieving an optimal design; the other is the correct apportioning of budgets   . The \nnext four chapters, dedicated to analyzing the different design domains, will examine \nin detail the allocation of functions and budgets in the design process    of each domain. \n\n    Chapter 8   \n\n The Observables and Instruments Domain       \n\nM.A. Aguirre, Introduction to Space Systems: Design and Synthesis, Space Technology Library 27, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8, \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n178 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nThis chapter will analyze this in two sections: one dedicated to the allocation of func-\ntions in an instrument and the other to the allocation of budgets   . \n\n Figure   7.1     of the previous chapter presented the requirements  fl ow-down process. \nThe  fi gure\u2019s upper part depicted the highest-level decisions made early in the design \nprocess, most of which are related to observables. Figure  8.1  focuses in these \ndecisions.  \n\n The purpose of space missions is to acquire information on the objects or pro-\ncesses under observation. In order to acquire that information, space missions use \ninstruments; that is, the observables and the observing instruments represent the foun-\ndations of the mission and will shape the space system\u2019s design from beginning to \nend. All design decisions involve compromises and bidirectional interactions; never-\ntheless, instrument requirements \u2013 being so integral to the mission\u2019s fundamental \naims \u2013 usually govern the design of all the other system components. The exception \nis when the observable    coupled with instrument requirements unavoidably push the \nmission beyond the fundamental programmatic constraints    of cost   , risk,    and schedul-\ning. This kind of situation would entail either a redesign in conjunction with reduced \nmission objectives, or even cancelation of the mission as a whole. \n\n    8.1.   Observables and instrument selection \n\n In principle, a mission\u2019s consumer    will be interested in receiving the data they require \nfor studying the target object and/or processes of interest, and not in the observing \ntechnique    employed. An oceanographer would be interested in receiving a certain \nquality and quantity of ocean circulation    data, not in whether the data was gathered \nby radar altimetry   , thermal infrared    sensing, Doppler radar techniques, or by buoys \nmeasuring the ocean currents in situ   . It could be argued that a system designer starting \nfrom consumer needs should offer a choice of alternative observing techniques and \nshould attempt to come up with the most ef fi cient technique for ful fi lling those needs. \nNevertheless, this is not usually the case and as pointed out in Section   7.1.1    , the \nchoice of observing technique is most often made by the mission\u2019s consumer prior to \nthe start of the design process   ; hence, the choice is presented to the mission\u2019s designer \nas a design constraint   . \n\n In the interrelation between observables    and observing techniques, two situations \nare possible:\n\n  Figure 8.1.    External Interrelations of the Observables    and Instruments Domain.       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n179The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\n   New observing techniques enabling breakthroughs regarding the quality or quan-\u2022 \ntity of data gathered from observables. This is more common on advancement-of-\nscience missions (see Section   4.5.3    ).  \n  Mature situations where more than one well-proven observing technique    is able to \u2022 \nprovide data on the observable. This is more common in operational missions    (see \nSection   4.5.4    ).    \n\n In the promotion of new space missions involving new observing techniques, \nscientists occupied with the observable    and scientists favoring the new observing \ntechnique    always act as a team. Before the architect    begins considering how to imple-\nment any potential new mission design, both the observables    and the observing-\ntechniques scientists should have produced a viable preliminary observing concept. \nESA\u2019s mission Aeolus    studies winds by measuring the Doppler shift    generated by \nwind-carried particles on a laser signal emitted by and re fl ected back to the satellite. \nEarly support for the mission came from atmospheric and laser scientists. Atmospheric \nscientists promoted Aeolus because it featured a scienti fi c breakthrough \u2013 the obten-\ntion of wind pro fi les in cloudless air \u2013 while laser scientists supported it for its poten-\ntial value to the development of their research  fi eld. Thus, the space mission designer \nwas faced with designing a mission using a currently active optical technique and was \nnot starting from a totally clean slate. \n\n In the case of operational missions   , the observing technologies are normally \nmature and the mission designer has more freedom to select the instrument concept \nfrom within a set of possible observing techniques. Returning to the example pro-\nvided in Section   7.1.1    , atmospheric winds can be observed using active scatterome-\nters (as in MetOp    1 ), passive polarimetric microwave radiometers    (as in Coriolis/\nWindSat    2 ), or active Doppler LIDAR (as in Aeolus    3 ). Ocean surface winds    can also \nbe obtained as a by-product from radar altimetry    and high-altitude winds assessed by \nmeasuring cloud displacements from a temporal series of images. The consumer    \ncould provide their requirements regarding the observable    without any reference to \nthe observing technique   , allowing the designer to study a number of options for the \nmost cost-ef fi cient observing technique and mission implementation which best meet \nthe project\u2019s goals. \n\n Nevertheless, consumers    usually know the strengths and weaknesses of existing \ninstruments    and will always take that knowledge into account when expressing their \nneeds. Operational agencies such as NOAA or Eumetsat normally federate consum-\ners and produce the highest-level documentation concerning observables   , as well as \nrequirement documents based on existing types of observing techniques. The result \nis, once again, that the mission designer will not be starting from the observable    but \nrather from one or several possible instrument concepts. \n\n In the rare cases where the architect    needs to perform instrument trades, he will \ntake his cue from the mission\u2019s fundamental aims and will study all available instru-\nment alternatives. Each instrument alternative will focus on observing a different \n\n   1     http://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPmetop.html    .  \n   2     http://directory.eoportal.org/pres_CoriolisWindSat.html    .  \n   3     http://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPadmaeolus.html    .  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPmetop.html\nhttp://directory.eoportal.org/pres_CoriolisWindSat.html\nhttp://www.esa.int/esaLP/LPadmaeolus.html\n\n\n180 Introduction to Space Systems\n\naspect of the events under observation, and will offer different advantages and \ndisadvantages as regards mission performance and development costs and risks. \nThese different instrument alternatives might also entail distinct basic architectures \nfor the mission. Finally, the optimal alternative will be chosen based on its balance of \nadvantages and disadvantages vis-\u00e0-vis the mission aims. This kind of comparison \namong widely differing options is a dif fi cult and prolonged process. Properly performed, \nit involves a thorough assessment of needs, the apportioning of the highest-level require-\nments    to the elements of the system, designs ful fi lling the apportioned requirements, the \nestablishing of alternative instrument concepts detailed enough to allow an estimation of \nend-to-end performances   , and estimations of costs and risks for each alternative. These \nprocedures are far from simple and cannot be frequently repeated.  \n\n    8.2.   Elements and components involved in the observables \nand instruments domain \n\n Chapters   9    ,   10    ,   11    , and   12     begin with an overview of the elements and components \ninvolved in the design domains to be discussed, even though the book\u2019s purpose, as \nstated in Chapter   1    , is to \u201cdescribe and analyze space systems not from the point of \nview of their elements but from the point of view of the interrelations between them.\u201d \nChapter   1     also indicated \u201cIt is expected that the reader has already learned about \nspace system technologies from the many excellent texts already available covering \nthese subjects.\u201d In accordance with these statements, the aim of this and the following \noverviews is not to present in detail the science and technologies related to each \ndomain, nor even to provide primers of them, but rather to recall the functions per-\nformed by the components of the domain and to serve as an introduction to an analy-\nsis of their interrelations. \n\n As in the previous section, we will examine the components of this domain by \nclassifying them according to instrument type, not by type of observable. Satellite \npayloads can be divided into six types:\n\n   Remote sensing, passive optical instruments     \u2022 \n  Remote sensing, active optical instruments     \u2022 \n  Remote sensing, passive microwave instruments     \u2022 \n  Remote sensing, active microwave instruments     \u2022 \n  In situ sensing instruments     \u2022 \n  Communications payloads       \u2022 \n\n The  fi rst four categories follow the standard division of remote sensing    space \ninstruments engineering   . From the architect   \u2019s viewpoint, this is also a sensible divi-\nsion because each one of these classes has different implementation problems. For \nexample, passive microwave instruments    are not driven by solar illumination, \nwhereas passive optical instruments    are. These four types of instruments detect elec-\ntromagnetic radiation    coming from the observable    being studied. In the case of pas-\nsive instruments this radiation will be either radiation naturally emitted by the source \nor solar radiation re fl ected by it. Active instruments produce and emit their own \nradiation that is scattered by the event and detected back by the instruments. In situ    \nmeasuring instruments are exceptionally diverse.

Communications payloads are carried \nnot only by communications satellites but also by all satellites that always need to \ncommunicate with ground. \n\n    8.2.1.   Passive optical \n\n Passive optical instruments    detect the intensity of the optical radiation arriving from \na speci fi c direction of space; hence, they provide spatial (direction) and radiometric \n(intensity, frequency) information. Depending on the frequency they are registering, \nthese instruments can detect gamma or X rays   , ultraviolet   , visible, or infrared    radia-\ntion. The instrument is able to detect one, several, or many frequency bands   . The \ninstrument can detect radiation produced directly by the observable    or, in the case of \nthe Earth    or other planets    illuminated by the Sun   , solar radiation re fl ected by the \nobservable. \n\n Instruments that detect electromagnetic radiation    have been traditionally classi fi ed \nas imagers   , spectrometers,    and radiometers   . Imagers gather mainly spatial informa-\ntion, spectrometers mainly spectral data, and radiometers radiation intensity data. \nNevertheless, most modern instruments    feature all three: good radiometric quality   , \ngood spectral resolution,    and good spatial resolution   . However, one of the three \naspects always functions as the main design driver. Panchromatic imagers for high-\nresolution    Earth    observation   , for example, are driven mainly by spatial resolution. \n\n Passive optical instruments    include the following components (Figure  8.2 ): \n\n   Telescopes collecting energy arriving from the region of space being observed  \u2022 \n  Components such as  fi lters or spectrometers    that disperse incoming radiation into \u2022 \nfrequency bands    in accordance with observational requirements     \n  Focal planes where radiation is detected and transformed into a signal  \u2022 \n  Pointing and scanning components for orienting telescopes toward areas of \u2022 \ninterest     \n\nIncoming Radiation\n\nPointing\nmechanisms \n\nTelescope \n\nFocalized\nRadiation\n\nFrequency 1\n\nFrequency 2\n\nFrequency n\n\nDispersive\ncomponent\n\nDetector\nArray(s)\n\nE\nle\n\nct\nro\n\nni\ncs\n\n \n\nCalibration\ncomponents\n\nBaffle\n\n  Figure 8.2.

The number of groups of optical \nelements can also be used to classify telescopes: Schmidt telescopes use one set of \noptical elements groups, Cassegrain two, and three mirror anastigmatic (TMA) \nthree. Instruments with a larger number of groups of optical elements are better qual-\nity but are also more complex. Nonfocusing telescopes using masks to determine the \ndirection of incoming radiation are used for examining higher-energy X-rays or \ncosmic rays. \n\n Pointing mirrors   , normally controlled by pointing    mechanisms   , are required for \npointing the instrument or its entrance optics toward the observable   . The area of \ninterest    for a particular observation may be much larger than the telescope   \u2019s  fi eld-\nof-view,    in which case mechanisms for scanning the entire area can be employed. \nSometimes the satellite as a whole is facing in the optimal direction; in that case \npointing mechanisms will be unnecessary (Figure  8.3 ). At any rate, the telescope\u2019s \nscanning speed must be fast enough to completely cover the area of interest within \nthe required time. \n\n In some cases the protection of the telescope    against unwanted light sources \nrequires the use of large, complex, and often deployable structures    called baf fl es    that \nconspicuously drive the con fi guration    of the satellite. Figure  8.6 , provides a good \nexample of a large baf fl e. Figures   7.5    ,   7.6    , and   7.7     also depict baf fl es of different \nsizes. Nevertheless, Herschel    (Figure   7.9    ) and JWST    (Figure   7.10    ) do not use cylin-\ndrical baf fl es but large  fl at screens to avoid light from unwanted sources \u2013 mainly the \nSun    \u2013 entering or affecting the telescope. In many cases the external baf fl es are large \nand introduce complex accommodation design issues for the satellite. \n\n Most passive optical instruments    acquire information in more than one frequency \nband, so it is necessary to include optical components capable of separating the \nincoming radiation into as many bands as required, and each band must cover the \nrequired bandwidth   . Filters are introduced to separate the incoming light into a few \nto a moderate number of frequency bands    and spectrometers    are used to provide \nmany bands with  fi ne spectral resolutions. \n\n The radiation will be detected by a sensor array located in the instrument\u2019s focal \nplane    and made up of individual detectors. Each individual detector will provide a \nsignal proportional to the radiation intensity coming from a speci fi c direction and in \na speci fi c frequency band. The instantaneous  fi eld of view    of the instrument divided \nby the number of detectors will determine the angular resolution of the observation \nand the angular resolution of the detector multiplied by the distance to the observable    \nwill determine the spatial resolution   .  \n\n The calibration    component provides radiation of a well-known intensity and spec-\ntral character that can be used to verify the output of the detectors with that carefully \ncontrolled input. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n183The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\n  Figure 8.3.    Instrument Pointing    Alternatives: Satellite Versus Mechanisms    (Courtesy of \nEADS Astrium).       \n\n The instrument also requires electronics to read and digitize the signal produced by \nthe detectors, and electronics for instrument data processing    and instrument control. \n\n It is necessary to generate an \u201cimage cube\u201d with three dimensions: along the \nimage, across the image, and along its spectral content. Nevertheless, the detector \narray    will consist of one of the following: a single detector, a one-dimensional line of \ndetectors, or a two-dimensional matrix of detectors. To derive the three dimensions \nof the image cube from the zero, one, or two dimensions of the sensor array requires \nthe use of supplementary tools to provide the missing dimensions. These tools are:\n\n   The movement of the satellite along the orbit providing an along-track swath  \u2022 \n  Scanning pointing    mechanisms   , providing an across-track    swath  \u2022 \n  Dispersive components and multiple detector arrays    providing the spectral \u2022 \ncontent    \n\n In \u201cwhiskbroom    arrangements\u201d one or a very small number of detectors are \nmechanically scanned to provide the across-track    swath. One single detector with \nadequate temporal response should be able to provide an image if the scanning speed \nis fast enough to allow the across-track swath to be scanned in the time it takes the \nsatellite to travel one pixel of along-track spatial resolution   . Using more than one \npixel will proportionally reduce the required scanning speed. In all cases the velocity \nof the satellite along the orbit provides the along-track swath. The frequency dimen-\nsion will be provided by the use of dispersive components    sending the different bands \nto different sensor arrays, one per frequency band of interest (Figure  8.4 ).  \n\n In \u201cpush broom\u201d arrangements, the focal plane    detector array    will have a long \ndimension possessing as many detectors as needed to cover the entire swath required. \nAs with the whiskbroom    arrangement, the along-track scanning will be provided, by \nthe movement of the satellite along its orbit. This approach requires complex detector \narrays   , though scanning mechanisms    are not needed. As before, the frequency dimen-\nsion will be provided by the use of dispersive components    sending the different bands \nto distinct long linear arrays, one per frequency band of interest. A matrix array con-\nsisting of a number of rows and columns can employ each row for a different fre-\nquency. Dispersive components or  fi lters will split the radiation so that the necessary \nradiation frequencies illuminate the different rows. Matrix arrays can also be used to \nimprove the radiometric performance. As the satellite moves, the different rows can \n\n\n\n184 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nbe dedicated to observing the same ground spatial resolution    cell at the same fre-\nquency. This will increase the actual observing time and allow a better radiometric \nperformance. \n\n In step-and-stare arrangements, a square two-dimensional detector array    will pro-\nvide spatial information in the along- and across-track    directions. Once the image is \nacquired, the satellite, or appropriate mechanisms   , will move the line of sight    to the \nnext instantaneous  fi eld of view    until the total area of interest    is covered. \n\n The instrument design will be shaped by the following set of requirements:\n\n   The spatial resolution    will determine the telescope   \u2019s aperture diameter and focal \u2022 \nlength   . This drives the size of the instrument and of the whole satellite.  \n  The spectral resolution    will de fi ne the nature of the dispersive component:  fi lters \u2022 \nor spectrometer.  \n  The number of spectral bands    will drive the dispersive components    and the detec-\u2022 \ntor array   (s) concepts.  \n  High radiometric accuracy    requires high radiation collection capabilities: large \u2022 \ntelescope    apertures and long integration times by the detectors. Higher radiometric \naccuracy will also require the use of sophisticated calibration    components.  \n  The time speci fi ed for providing synoptic views    of the area of interest    will deter-\u2022 \nmine the instrument swa   th, which in turn will in fl uence the number of pixels of the \ndetector array   . Larger swaths entail large aperture optics, high data throughput,    \nand complex data processing electronics   .    \n\n The telescope    concept, the focal plane    concept, and the scanning concept must \nalso be determined. For its part, the instrument concept and size will govern the satel-\nlite\u2019s interface requirements   , namely: instrument mass    and volume, visibility and \npointing    needs, power and energy consumption, instrument data throughput   , and \nthermal interfaces   .

The instrument\u2019s visibility needs will also be a \nstrong in fl uence on the selection of the satellite\u2019s con fi guration   , orbit, and attitude. \n\n The design of optical instruments    \u2013 optical concept, spectrometer concept, focal \nplane    and detector array    concepts, aperture size, and focal length    \u2013 is a highly special-\nized task and all design decisions related to them are left in the hands of specialists. \nThese specialists will also provide architects with the designs for the required mecha-\nnisms   , structure and thermal control    concepts, and information on the risks associated \nwith the designs and ways to reduce them in the preliminary design stages. The devel-\nopment of large detector arrays    is an especially long and complex process. \n\n Most instrument-related design decisions encompass fundamental system-level \nimplications, and the architect    must provide relevant feedback to specialists, espe-\ncially in those cases where design decisions might have detrimental impacts on other \ncomponents of the system. Accordingly, architects must always be prepared to arrive \nat reasonable compromises regarding basic mission parameters such as instrument \naperture, orbit attitude, satellite con fi guration,    and overall system data throughput. \n\n The instrument aperture    and the resulting overall instrument size    will require \nrepeated interaction between specialists and the architect   . In some cases it will be \nimpossible to avoid the use of optical components of dimensions incompatible with \ntheir accommodation in the launcher   . This will require the use of deployable optics    \nor even synthetic aperture optics   . The deployable optics of JWST    (Figures   7.10     and \n 8.7 ) is a good example of this approach. \n\n Decisions regarding the instrument pointing    concept and the allocation of pointing \nfunctions \u2013 pointing by the instrument    or pointing by the satellite    \u2013 will also demand \nfrequent interaction between the different specialists and the architect   . \n\n Instruments requiring high swath, high resolution,    and the recovery of a large \nnumber of frequency bands    will produce large amounts of data. This data throughput    \nwill drive the downlink data  fl ow architecture   . The architect    will need to interact with \nspecialists and the consumers    to arrive at compromises concerning instrument perfor-\nmance, instrument design complexity, in-orbit or on-ground data processing, and data \ndownlink architecture. \n\n Instrument thermal control    and thermal stability    needs and their corresponding \ndesign solutions also have system-level implications that require interaction between \nthe architect    and specialists.  \n\n    8.2.2.   Active optical \n\n Active optical instruments    direct optical wavelength    radiation toward a target under \nstudy and detect the subsequent backscattered radiation. Lasers are used as the source \nof the emitted radiation from active optical instruments    because laser light is coherent \nand possesses a well-de fi ned wavelength. \n\n There are different types of Laser-based active optical instruments   :\n\n   Laser Doppler    emits laser pulses that are backscattered by dust or molecules in the \u2022 \natmosphere. The return signal is analyzed to detect the Doppler shift    produced by \nthe velocity of the dust and the molecules, permitting the derivation of atmo-\nspheric wind data.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n186 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  Backscatter Lidars    send laser pulses and measure the intensity of the backscattered \u2022 \nsignals. This allows the derivation of cloud properties or dust density pro fi les.  \n  Laser range fi nders    measure the delay of the backscatter signal to determine the \u2022 \ndistance from the instrument to the target. This distance can be used to detect \nparameters like treetop height or ice thickness.  \n  Lasers can also be used to detect chemical composition of the atmosphere by \u2022 \ndetecting  fi ne absorption or emission lines associated with speci fi c chemical \nspecies.    \n\n Both active and passive optical instruments    feature the same components, and the \nprevious section\u2019s account is applicable, except that active instruments also require a \nlaser source and laser emitting optics. Active optical instrument can operate with one \nor several wavelengths. If several wavelengths are used different laser sources must \nbe provided, as well as the necessary dispersive components    to select the frequency \nbands    of interest, along with as many detector arrays    as there are frequency bands of \ninterest. \n\n The fundamental design decisions affecting active optical instruments are gov-\nerned by the need to receive a suf fi cient quantity of backscattered radiation to detect \nthe parameters under observation with the necessary accuracy. This can be accom-\nplished by increasing either the laser emitter\u2019s power or the collecting capability \n(aperture size) of the receiving telescope   . High-power lasers require lots of electrical \npower and will produce large amounts of heat that needs to be dissipated from the \nlaser source. To produce high-powered, highly reliable and long-lasting lasers is not \neasy, and extended active optical missions require high levels of redundancy in the \nnumber of laser sources in order to offset their eventual failure in orbit. Increasing the \nreceiving telescope\u2019s aperture will reduce the laser source\u2019s necessary power, but \nlarge telescopes are heavy and dif fi cult to accommodate, driving up the size of the \nentire satellite and increasing mission costs. \n\n It must be decided if the instrument will have a constant or a variable line of sight   . \nWith a single line of sight, the instrument can only provide data along a line de fi ned \nby the satellite\u2019s  fl ight direction and attitude. If the line of sight changes rapidly \nenough, the instrument will be able to provide a swath. This increases the mission\u2019s \nyield but complicates the concept, because each cell covered by the swath requires its \nown laser pulse and because the laser pulse\u2019s line of sight and the pointing    of the \nreceiving telescope    needs to change quickly enough to allow coverage of the entire \nswath. These are burdensome requirements that greatly complicate the design. \n\n Active optical instruments require excellent dimensional stability    in both the \ninstrument and the satellite as a whole. This demands the use of high-performance \nthermal control    and  fi rst-rate high dimensional stability structures. Dimensional sta-\nbility is made more complicated by the heat generated by the laser source. The dis-\nsipation of this heat requires the use of special cooling    devices. \n\n The provision, or not, of swath is a basic trade-off    that requires the balancing of \nthe consumers   \u2019 desire for large quantities of good quality data and the very serious \ndif fi culties of providing an active optical instrument able to provide it. The  fi nal deci-\nsion will depend on how the architect    balances the tensions between consumer    needs \nand the sponsor   \u2019s willingness to pay the consequent costs. \n\n As in the case of passive optical instruments   , the actual design remains in the \nhands of specialists. The architect    shall take the lead on issues related to the trade-off    \n\n\n\n187The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\nbetween laser power and telescope    aperture size. Large instrument size    has a major \nimpact on a satellite\u2019s mass, con fi guration,    and cost   . High laser power leads to a short \nmission life    and increased mission risk   . The architect must balance the costs associ-\nated with large instrument apertures and the risk associated with high laser energies. \nOrbit altitude is another area where the architect shall take the lead. Flying at low \naltitudes reduces distance to the target, and permits the use of lower laser power and \nreduced telescope size. Nevertheless, low-altitude orbits    require larger amounts of \nfuel for orbit maintenance    and more frequent sources of pointing    disturbance from \nthruster  fi rings. The architect must balance instrument complexity with the conse-\nquences for the orbit control    and attitude control    system.  \n\n    8.2.3.   Passive microwave \n\n Passive microwave instruments    measure the intensity of the natural microwave radia-\ntion produced by the events under observation. Passive microwave instruments    are \nindependent of the Sun   \u2019s illumination, and clouds are fairly transparent to them. This \nindependence from light and atmospheric conditions is a major advantage of this kind \nof instrument. Like passive optical instruments   , passive microwave instruments    can \nalso detect spatial information, spectral information, radiometric information, or any \ncombination of them, but in general the principle design determinant is the radiomet-\nric quality   , that is, the accurate measurement of radiation intensity. \n\n Passive microwave instruments   , as with passive optical instruments   , are divided \ninto categories according to their frequency range. Passive microwave radiometers    \nfrom 1 GHz to 150 GHz are common. Observation at 1.4 GHz provides soil moisture \nand sea-surface temperatures; wind over the ocean can be detected at 10 and 18 GHz; \nrain can be detected in the ranges around 18.7 GHz; water vapor at 23.8 GHz; liquid \nwater in clouds at 36.5 GHz; and ice in clouds at 137 GHz. Passive microwave instru-\nments    can also provide temperature sounding and atmospheric humidity. Temperature \ncan be sounded in the 60\u201363 GHz range and humidity in the 50\u201357 GHz range. \n\n Microwave instruments can be either single pixel, providing information solely \nover the point in the antenna\u2019s line of sight   , or imagers    providing images over a given \nswath. For the latter the antenna must scan to provide the desired coverage. \n\n A passive microwave radiometer\u2019s basic detection chain includes: the collecting \nantenna, a low-noise ampli fi er    to amplify the arriving signal, a  fi lter to select the \nfrequency of interest, and the detector. Heterodyne receivers    also include an oscillator \nthat produces an intermediate frequency that is combined with the incoming radiation \nand later ampli fi ed and detected. Passive microwave radiometers    also require calibra-\ntion    devices, control and processing electronics, structure, baf fl ing, thermal control, \nand scanning mechanisms. Instruments designed to study the lower frequencies of the \nmicrowave range are proportionally larger and use different focusing and detecting \ntechnologies than instruments studying the higher end of the range. Microwave radi-\nometers require an adequate calibration of the instrument. This is normally accom-\nplished by providing a calibrated source of microwave radiation and a view of cold \ndeep space    as a second reference. Taking into account microwave radiation\u2019s longer \nwavelengths, the spatial resolution    will be limited by the aperture of the instrument. \nThe spatial resolution of microwave instruments    is much coarser than the resolution \nof optical instruments. Earth    observation    optical instruments have resolutions from \n\n\n\n188 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nthe kilometer range to below 1 m, while Earth observation microwave instruments \nhave resolutions in the 1 km to tenths of a kilometer range. Microwave instruments \nuse scanning mechanisms    with rotating re fl ective surfaces. If high spatial resolution \nis required the rotating surface must be large and the perturbations generated by the \nrotation of the large re fl ecting surface must be minimized by using counter-rotating \nor balancing mechanisms. \n\n As in the case of optical instruments   , the most important decision is to de fi ne the \naperture of the receiving antennas, which will determine the instrument\u2019s size and \nwill be driven by the required spatial resolution   . The number of bands to be observed \nwill depend on the nature of the events being studied and on the consumer   \u2019s require-\nments. The receiving horns,  fi lters, and detectors for the different frequencies must be \naccommodated, and the detection approach, direct or heterodyne, must be decided \nupon. \n\n Due to the proportionally low resolution of microwave instruments   , their data \nthroughput    is moderate, hence the resulting requirements on data processing and data \ndownlink    are also modest and the resulting data handling    designs are easy to imple-\nment. On the other hand, microwave instruments can be large, making their mechani-\ncal and thermal design    complex. \n\n As in all the previous cases, the design of the instrument is the responsibility of \ninstrument specialists, but scanning microwave instruments also call for the early \ninvolvement of structural, mechanical, and thermal control specialists to solve the \nmechanical and thermal problems that will arise as a consequence of its large mass \nand size, by its rotating elements and by its thermal and dimensional stability    \ndemands. The architect    should mediate the interaction among all these specialists. \nFurthermore, any unbalance in the rotating components will produce forces and \ntorques    that will alter the pointing    of the satellite; this will inevitably involve interac-\ntions among the instrument and attitude control    specialists that will also need mediat-\ning by the architect. \n\n A supplementary problem requiring the architect   \u2019s attention is the presence of \npotential arti fi cial sources of radiation that can pollute the radiation emitted by the \nsource being observed. Ground-based radars and communication antennas    can emit \nradiation that the instrument receives mixed with the signal produced by the source. \nInternational regulations establish which bands are protected for Earth    observation    \ninstruments detection. The consumer   , the architect, and the instrument designer must \nbe aware of this regulatory environment. The satellite itself will also be carrying com-\nmunication antennas or radars that are sources of microwave radiation. These anten-\nnas must be designed to avoid contamination of the signal being measured by the \nmicrowave radiometer. This means the use of emitting frequencies that are well sepa-\nrated from the sensitive receiving frequencies. To further reduce the problem, the \nemitting and receiving antennas must be physically separated. This may have a severe \nimpact on the satellite\u2019s con fi guration    and also requires the architect\u2019s attention.  \n\n    8.2.4.   Active microwave \n\n As in the case of active optical instruments   , active microwave instruments    emit \nmicrowave radiation to illuminate the area being observed. The advantage of active \nmicrowave instruments is that they produce their own illumination of the target, \n\n\n\n189The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\nallowing observation independent of lighting and climatic conditions, including the \nabsence of sunlight or the presence of clouds. Active microwave instruments have \nbeen used widely for Earth    observation   . \n\n Imaging radars send radar pulses that are re fl ected back and transformed into \nimages of the observed target. Taking into account the wavelength    of the radiation \nand the distance between a satellite and its target, the normal instrument aperture \nneeded for any reasonable spatial resolution    would be impossibly large. To solve this \nproblem satellites use Synthetic Aperture Radars    (SARs   ), which provide spatial reso-\nlutions comparable to the resolutions provided by optical instruments   . SARs, which \nare side-looking radars, use sophisticated post-processing of the received signal to \nemulate a receiving antenna with an aperture equal to the distance traveled by the \nsatellite while it illuminates each observed point. SARs are powerful imaging instru-\nments routinely providing up to meter-level resolutions with antennas in the order of \nup to tens of square meters at orbit altitudes    of 600\u2013800 km and with swaths in the \norder of tenths to hundreds of kilometers. \n\n Scatterometers provide information on the texture of the surface being observed \nby studying the characteristics of the backscatter radiation. Scatterometers are used \nto determine wind speeds over the water, since the texture of the air-water interface \nchanges with wind speed. They can also be used to detect ice or snowmelt. \n\n Radar altimeters are Nadir   -looking radars that emit pulses and determine the dis-\ntance to targets by measuring the time it takes for the signal to return to the instru-\nment. Radar altimeters    are used to study the water levels of oceans, rivers, and \nlakes. \n\n Cloud and rain radars    are able to determine the density of clouds and the intensity \nof precipitation by analyzing radar signals backscattered by clouds particles, rain-\ndrops, or snow fl akes. Radar altimeters    and cloud and rain radars are normally swath-\nless \u201csounders,\u201d though they can be made to provide moderate swaths, of the order \nof many tenths of kilometers. \n\n Active microwave instruments    can be divided (Figure  8.5 ) into the following com-\nponents, which are going to be described in the following paragraph: \n\n  Figure 8.5.   SAR    and RA Functional Block Diagram.       \n\n\n\n190 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n   Front end, which includes the antenna, either parabolic or planar, and also other \u2022 \nelements used for emission and reception of the radar signal  \n  Back end, which includes all the necessary electronic for the operation of the \u2022 \nradar  \n  Instrument control and data processing electronics    \u2022 \n\n The front end of the instrument produces and receives the high-frequency micro-\nwave radiation. The antenna receives and emits the microwave radiation. Synthetic \nAperture Radar (SAR   ) antennas are either parabolic dishes or  fl at arrays and are nor-\nmally large, measuring tens of square meters; cloud, rain, and snow radars are of \nintermediate size, between a few and ten square meters; and radar altimeters are \nsmall, with sizes around 1 m 2 . Instruments working at longer wavelengths are propor-\ntionally larger but emit smaller amounts of radiating energy, thus simplifying the \nelectrical power demand and thermal dissipation con fi gurations. Large antennae \nrequire complex stowage and deployment mechanisms    to solve the contradiction \nbetween the necessary small volume accommodation inside the launcher    and the \nrequired large area con fi guration    in orbit. The mechanical and thermal design    of large \ndeployable antennae is a complex specialized engineering domain that shall be taken \ninto consideration from the earliest stages of the system de fi nition. Flat array anten-\nnae have a large number of similar radiating elements organized and distributed so \nthat they form the desired antenna beam. Parabolic antennae concentrate the emitted \nor received signal in the focus of the parabola   . Active antennae    have located on their \nsurface a very large number of small electronic emitting and receiving modules. The \nbehavior of these modules can be recon fi gured in a multiplicity of ways allowing the \nantenna to provide different radar modes with different swaths and resolutions. \nActive antennae have a variety of radio frequency power architectures, such as fully \nor partially distributed radio frequency power, or powered by row or columns of \nactive elements. Nonactive antennas have a centralized front end, and the signal is \ndistributed to the parabolic antennas or to the  fl at array radiating elements. \n\n The back end is the part of the radar that operates at lower frequencies and that \nperforms the detection and digitization of the backscatter radiation. The back end also \ngenerates the signal to be emitted, which will be modulated and ampli fi ed in the front \nend. The back-end    functions normally include: the up- and down-frequency conver-\nsion, the calibration    hardware, and time references. The instrument will also include \nall the necessary electronics for power production and delivery, data handling,    and \ninstrument control. \n\n Low-frequency L- or P-band SAR   \u2019s possess very large antennas and require com-\nplex deployment mechanisms    and sophisticated structural design. Higher-frequency \nradars such as C-X, or Ka-band    call for smaller but still fairly large \u2013 usually deploy-\nable \u2013 antennas. Higher-frequency SAR\u2019s    generally provide demanding spatial reso-\nlutions and feature comparatively smaller antennas as well as proportionally high \nlevels of energy emission, which require complex power generation and heat dissipa-\ntion    systems. \n\n Active microwave instruments    can emit and receive in single or multiple polariza-\ntions in one or multiple bands and are able to provide interferometric products. SARs    \nemploying active antennas are  fl exible and able to operate in different modes; some \nwith more swath and lower resolutions and others with enhanced resolution but \n\n\n\n191The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\nsmaller swath. A scheme must be designed for the selection of the different modes to \nbe used. Active antennae    are also able to point in different directions and provide fast \nscan within large ranges. Nonactive antennae can only change pointing    by slowly \nchanging the attitude of the satellite. \n\n The choice of frequency or frequencies and the polarizations to be used depends \ndirectly on the application: ocean and ice observation favors C-band, vegetation L-, \nor P-bands, near optical quality imaging favors the X-band   , and land classi fi cation \nrequires multiple frequencies and polarizations. Therefore, the choice of frequencies \nand polarizations to be used is not normally a design decision, but a requirement that \nthe designer must ful fi ll. \n\n Active microwave instrument design is a complex process involving the de fi nition \nof many strongly interrelated parameters including: the radar pulse repetition rate   ; the \npulse bandwidth   ; the allocation of time windows for pulse transmission and recep-\ntion; pulse energy   , antenna width and length; the different combinations of swath and \nresolution; and the maximum and minimum incidence angle    of the microwave beam \nover the ground. The specialists must perform multiple iterations in order to produce \na design capable of ful fi lling mission requirements   . These iterations are integral to the \ninstrument design process   . \n\n The choice of the antenna concept and shape (parabolic or  fl at array, and if  fl at \narray, active versus nonactive) are critical design decisions. Active microwave instru-\nments use electronic scanning to provide swath widths and their placement on the \nground, so scanning mechanisms    are unnecessary. The large size of many SAR    anten-\nnas, however, requires complex deployment mechanisms    demanding careful design. \nThe data throughput   , power consumption,    and heat dissipation    of SARs    are usually \nvery high, and become even more severe for high-frequency high-resolution SARs. \nHigh-resolution SARs cannot operate continuously because it would be impossible to \ndownlink    the enormous quantity of data produced, and because the antenna and back-\nend    electronics would overheat. The amount of time allocated for operation must be \nestablished by balancing the consumer   \u2019s desire for large data production, the regions \nof interest to be imaged, and remain compatible with the various platform subsystem    \ndesign limitations. \n\n Because SAR    antennas are large and can involve complex deployable structures    \nthat strongly in fl uence the stowed and deployed con fi guration    of the satellite, a SAR \nwill dominate the payload-platform interfaces, power and energy generation and \nmanagement, satellite operating and safe mode    attitudes, and system data circulation, \neven if there are other instruments    on the same spacecraft. SARs    also require the \nformulation of operational strategies for providing optimal coverage or revisits. All \nthese aspects have implications for the overall mission design and demand intense \ninteraction among instrument specialists, mission architects, and all other mission \ndesign specialists. \n\n Radar altimeters    and the other active, nonimaging, microwave instruments are \ngenerally smaller, produce smaller amounts of data, use moderate amounts of power, \nand feature simple interfaces with their host satellite. In these cases, specialists will \nprovide the architect    with the overall instrument concept and a well-de fi ned set of \ninterfaces. \n\n In orbit, SARs    emit electromagnetic radiation    that could interfere with other \nequipment on the satellite and with ground activities. In order to avoid such interference, \n\n\n\n192 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nthe International Telecommunication Union allocates frequency ranges for use by \nspace-borne SARs. Space-borne X-band    SARs, for example, have been allotted the \n9,500\u20139,800 MHz frequency window   . Instrument design must take these frequency \nregulations into account. The ITU    has also established maximum limits on the power \ndensity that radars can use to illuminate the ground.  \n\n    8.2.5.   In situ instruments    \n\n Antennas or coils that react to the characteristics of the electrical  fi eld around the \nsatellite can be used as electric  fi eld sensors. Special sensors can detect magnetic \n fi elds. Mass spectrometers    can be used to detect chemical composition. There are also \ndetectors that identify the nature and energy of ions or high-energy particles such as \ncosmic rays. Accelerometers    detect atmospheric density    by measuring the accelera-\ntion of masses located on the satellite. Gravity  fi elds can be detected by monitoring \nthe differential movements between reference proof masses. The proof masses can be \nlocated on the same satellite, or on different satellites located hundreds of thousands \nof kilometers away. \n\n Gravity  fi eld sensors are complex instruments and they completely shape the host \nsatellite\u2019s con fi guration   . Gravity sensors require an extremely quiet satellite that \nminimizes parasitical disturbance accelerations and relative displacements within \nthe satellite. This requires the use of special attitude and orbital control    tools, as well \nas the provision of sophisticated thermal and structural concepts to minimize dimen-\nsional distortions. In situ instruments    for detecting the speed and density of the solar \nwind    or space dust; chemical composition of particles; density of matter or different \ntypes of ions; and the frequency of energetic particles are normally small and their \ninterfaces with the satellite can be de fi ned in terms of clear accommodation require-\nments   . The manufacturing of these instruments is highly specialized and requires \nvery speci fi c skills. The scientist intending to utilize the instrument\u2019s output often \ndirectly fabricates them. Instruments capable of detecting electric and magnetic \n fi elds are generally small but their satellite interfaces are complex. These instru-\nments are strong drivers of the satellite\u2019s con fi guration and overall design. Electric \nand magnetic  fi eld sensors need to be located far from the perturbing  fi elds gener-\nated by the host satellite\u2019s electronics   . This demands the use of large deployable \nbooms    for situating the instruments at their tip. Large deployable are  fl exible and \nthey will couple with the attitude control    system of the satellite making high-accu-\nracy pointing    complex. Magnetic  fi eld sensors also force strict requirements on the \nsatellite\u2019s overall design: materials able to generate magnetic  fi elds should be either \navoided altogether or strictly controlled, and the electronics, as well as the satellite\u2019s \nelectricity generation, storage, and distribution networks should be designed to mini-\nmize their magnetic signatures. Electric and magnetic  fi eld sensors also require that \nthe satellite\u2019s external surface be kept at a constant potential in order to avoid the \ngeneration of magnetic or electric  fi elds on this surface. Instruments for detecting \nvery-low-frequency variations of the electrical  fi eld may be very large, up to tens of \nmeters or more. \n\n As said before, many kinds of in situ    instruments are extremely specialized and the \nscientists themselves frequently manufacture them. If that is the case, the scientist \nmust also provide formal interface documentation for the accommodation of the \n\n\n\n193The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\ninstrument. As a consequence, the function, not just of the architect    but of the entire \nsatellite design team, will be reduced to accommodating the payload in line with the \nformal interface requirements   , accounting for all possible design constraints imposed \nby the other payload and platform requirements. The big exception is gravity    sensing, \nwhere the boundary between the instrument and the rest of the satellite becomes \nblurred: the instrument is the satellite and the satellite is the instrument. Every feature \nof the gravimeter will have an impact on the rest of the satellite, so instrument and \nsatellite must be designed together.  \n\n    8.2.6.   Communication payloads    \n\n The designation  communication satellite  is used for satellites that act mainly as relays \nof information previously sent to them;  communication payloads  are the payloads \ncarried by communication satellites   . There are many kinds of telecommunication \nmissions: they can be global or local; they can feature unidirectional or bidirectional \ninformation  fl ows; the communication lines they provide can be rigidly established \nor  fl exible, according to speci fi c needs; they can  fl y in different orbits. The design of \nspace communication missions is highly specialized and beyond the scope of this \nbook. Furthermore, communication satellites are often based on existing designs \nproviding little leeway for the work of architects. Nevertheless, communication mis-\nsions can serve as useful examples of satellite mission design, especially when dis-\ncussing issues such as orbits, constellation design, satellite con fi guration,    and satellite \nlauncher    interfaces. This book will use communication satellites as example of design \nseveral times in the following chapters. To the degree that all satellites receive and \nsend information, they are all communication missions. The communication compo-\nnents carried by all types of satellites will be discussed in Chapters   11     and   12    , which \ncover overall satellite data  fl ow.   \n\n    8.3.   Instruments examples \n\n    8.3.1.   Aeolus    \n\n    8.3.1.1.   Mission aim \n ESA\u2019s ADM-Aeolus    4  mission will be the  fi rst mission to provide global wind pro fi le \nmeasurements throughout the atmosphere. These pro fi les will  fi nd application in \nweather forecasting and lead to a deeper understanding of weather and climate pro-\ncesses. The provision of detailed wind pro fi les will bene fi t the accuracy of numerical \nmodeling of weather over the whole Earth   , especially in the tropical regions   , and will \nhelp in prediction of severe storms. Aeolus carries a Doppler wind Lidar   , which emits \npulses of light and registers the signals scattered back to the instrument by the clouds \nand dust in the atmosphere. The Doppler shift    of the backscattered signal provides the \nrelative velocity between satellite and air in the direction of the Lidar\u2019s line of sight   . \n\n   4   SDM-Aeolus    ESA\u2019s Wind Mission, ESA BR 236, ESA February 2005.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\n\n\n194 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nThe mission will be capable of providing global wind pro fi les up to altitudes of 30 km. \nFor winds within the lower 2 km of the atmosphere, the wind recovery accuracy will be \nbetter than 1 m/s. For winds between 2 km and 16 km altitude, the wind speed will be \nbetter than 2 m/s. The instrument will provide wind averages along a strip of 50 km and \na total of 120 wind pro fi les per hour. The mission will be launched in late 2010. The \nmission will last 3 years with a possible 1-year extension. It will be launched in a Vega    \nor Rockot    launcher   . It will  fl y at 408 km altitude, in a Sun   -synchronous orbit    with an \ninclination of 97.06\u00b0 and with a local time    of the ascending node    of 6:00 (Section   9.4.2    ). \nThe satellite\u2019s total mass will be 1,350 kg (650 kg of platform, 250 kg of propellant, \nand 450 kg of instruments   ). The central body    of the satellite is a cube 4.6 m high, 1.9 \nm long, and 2 m wide. The solar array    is able to provide 2.2 kW while the average \npower demand of the satellite is 1,400 W. The satellite will point toward Earth but will \nbe tilted by 35\u00b0 from the vertical in the across-track direction (Figure  8.6 ).   \n\n    8.3.1.2.   Instruments \n The Atmospheric Laser Doppler    Instrument (ALADIN) consists of a powerful laser \nsystem for emitting short laser pulses into the atmosphere; a large telescope    for col-\nlecting the backscattered light signal; and a very sensitive receiver for analyzing the \nDoppler shift    of the signals received from different layers of the atmosphere. The \nlaser pulses are generated by a diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser at 355 nm, with an \nenergy of 150 mJ. The pulses are not continuous; rather 7 s of pulses are emitted at \n100 Hz every 28 s. This provides a wind velocity pro fi le averaged over 50 km every \n200 km. The Cassegrain telescope is dominated by its main mirror, which measures \n1.5 m in diameter. ALADIN aims 35\u00b0 in the across-track    direction to avoid Doppler \nshift from its own velocity. Two optical analyzers measure the Doppler shift of the \nmolecular (Rayleigh) scattering, and the scattering from aerosols and water droplets \n\n  Figure 8.6.

Highly sensitive photodetectors then transform the light signals \ninto electric signals, which are ampli fi ed and stored on board until transmitted to the \nground for processing.   \n\n    8.3.2.   JWST    \n\n    8.3.2.1.   Mission aim \n The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST   )  5  was introduced in Section   7.2.1     and will \nbe discussed further in Section   10.3.3     as an example of satellite con fi guration   . It was \nconceived as a follow-up to the Hubble    Space Telescope, and will allow scientists to \nsee the most distant  fi rst generations of stars. These early stars and galaxies are so \nremote that the extremely faint signals and light they produce is strongly red-shifted \nto the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum   . To provide proper observation of \nthe faint targets in infrared    wavelengths, a very large diameter telescope    must be used, \nand it must be cooled to very low temperatures   . The mission will observe the  fi rst light \nafter the Big Bang, the assembly of young galaxies, and the birth of stars and planetary \nsystems. Astronomers will use JWST as an operational facility, which will receive \nobservation requests, prepare observation schedules, perform the observations, and \ndistribute the data. In accordance with operational mission    aims, it has been designed \nfor a long life of some 10 years. The satellite, with a mass of 6,800 kg will be launched \nin 2013 by an Ariane    5 ECA rocket into a heliocentric    halo orbit    around the Lagragian \nL2    point    (Section   9.4.6    ). In this orbit the distance to the Earth    will vary from 1.2 to 1.8 \nmillion km with a periodicity of 6 months. L2 is located at a  fi xed point relative to the \nEarth and Sun   , and from this location the Earth and Sun are in the same direction. The \nattitude of JWST is inertially stabilized   . In order to satisfy astronomers\u2019 observation \nrequests, the satellite\u2019s telescope must be able to change pointing    direction. However, \nif it is to avoid overheating by the Earth or Sun, it must adhere to strict pointing limita-\ntions (Figure   7.12    ). The impact of these limitations is severe and the telescope is \nprotected by a large deployable Sun-shield    that dominates the deployed con fi guration    \nof the satellite. The deployable Sun-shield is 19 by 13 m.  \n\n    8.3.2.2.   Instruments \n The 6.5 m aperture telescope    has a hinged, multifaceted, adjustable primary mirror, \nand a deployable secondary mirror with its support structure .The primary mirror is \nmade up of 10 hexagonal facets that are stowed at launch in three panels: the central \npanel, which is  fi xed, and the two side panels which are hinged and will be deployed \nin orbit. Another mechanism is used to deploy the telescope\u2019s secondary mirror that is \nalso stowed during launch (Figure  8.7 ). The primary mirror of JWST has six times the \narea of the Hubble    mirror but its density per unit of area is nine times lower than \nHubble\u2019s. The telescope\u2019s primary mirror with its 10 mirror elements can be adjusted \nin orbit to improve the resulting alignment after launching as well as the instrument\u2019s \ncool-down. The mirror distortions will be reduced to less than 0.15  m m.

This \nprovides suf fi cient sensitivity for adequately detecting the faint infrared    radiation pro-\nduced by the nascent stars and galaxies. For optimal performance, a mechanical cooler \nfurther reduces the temperature of the mid-infrared    detector assembly to 7 K. The \ntelescope observes in the 0.6\u201328  m m range and light from the collecting telescope is \nsubsequently sent to four different instruments   : a near-infrared    multiobject spectrom-\neter; a near-infrared    camera; a near-infrared    tunable  fi lters camera; and a mid-infrared    \ncamera and spectrometer. The four instruments will be packed in a special module that \nwill also provide structure, thermal control   , control electronics,    and data handling   .    \n\n    8.3.3.   Sentinel-3    \n\n    8.3.3.1.   Mission aim \n\n The Sentinel 3 mission 6  is part of the Global Monitoring for Environment and \nSecurity (GMES    7 ) initiative whose overall objective is to support Europe\u2019s goals \nregarding sustainable development. The mission is dedicated to the operational    \n(Section   4.5.4    ) provision of medium resolution global ocean and land observation, \nwith consistent quality and a high level of availability   . The implementation phase \nstarted in 2007, and launch will take place in 2012. The mission consists of a constel-\nlation of two satellites separated by 180\u00b0 and  fl ying Sun   -synchr   onous orbits    with \n98.6\u00b0 inclination. The orbits provide full Earth    coverage and uniform conditions of \nillumination throughout the year. The orbit altitude    is 800 km, and the orbital period    \nis such that the satellite performs exactly 385 orbits in 27 days. This allows an opti-\nmal coverage pattern for land and ocean applications. The satellite will be quali fi ed \nfor a minimum operational mission life    of 7 years but is being designed to function \n\n   6    GMES    Sentinel-3   .

The satellite\u2019s total mass is 1,400 kg, 100 kg of which is fuel. The \nsatellite\u2019s average power consumption    is 1,100 W. It has a lower cubic part carrying \nthe platform subsystems and an upper part where most of the instruments    are located \n(Figure  8.8 ).   \n\n    8.3.3.2.   Instruments \n Besides its large instrument complement, the satellite is still compact and compatible \nwith the volume and mass limitations of small launchers    (Figure  8.8 ). To provide the \ndifferent types of observables   , Sentinel-3    carries a large swath   /medium spatial resolu-\ntion    optical visible and near-infrared    instrument (OLCI), an optical visible and ther-\nmal imager (SLSTR), and a set of four instruments    constituting altogether a radar \naltimeter    system. Sentinel-3 will focus on four different types of observables:\n\n   Ocean color products used to derive biophysical data provided by the OLCI \u2022 \ninstrument  \n  Ocean topography data provided by the radar altimeter    instrument, supported by \u2022 \nthe microwave radiometer MWR, the laser retro-re fl ector LRR, and a GPS    \nreceiver  \n  Surface (land and sea) temperature provided by the SLSTR instrument  \u2022 \n  Land color products used to derive biophysical information about land and vegeta-\u2022 \ntion, produced by the synergetic use of SLSTR and OLCI instruments       \n\n OLCI is an optical medium resolution (300 m) wide swath (1,250 km) spectrom-\neter providing 21 bands in a frequency range going from 0.4 to 1.02  m m.

The SLSTR instrument is an optical mechanical scanning instrument \nproviding nine bands from 0.55 to 12  m m. The resolution provided goes from 500 m \nto 1 km. It has two scanning mechanisms    providing two views: one looking down and \nwith a swath of 1,800 km and the second one pointing    ahead and providing a swath \nof 750 km. This double view allows improved atmospheric correction and accurate \n\n  Figure 8.8.

The radar altimeter    (RA) sends pulses to the \nsurface of the water; the time needed for their return provides, after corrections, the \ndistance from the satellite to the water. To correct for delays produced by ions located \nin the radar signal\u2019s path, the RA emits pulses in two bands: Ku and C. The difference \nin delay between the two signals permits the derivation of the ion density in the path \ntraveled by the radar pulses. To adequately calculate this distance it is necessary to \ncorrect errors in the measurements; to that end, the satellite carries a passive micro-\nwave radiometer (MWR) to correct for water vapor induced delays, and a navigation \nsensor to establish an absolute reference position for the satellite, and to derive an \nabsolute actual ocean level. The comparison of this actual level with the reference level \nprovided by the equipotential gravity    of the Earth   \u2019s surface \u2013 the Geoid \u2013 provides \na record of ocean currents. The satellite also carries a cluster of mirrors (LRR) to \nre fl ect back the light sent by ground-based lasers, providing a supplementary tool for \norbit determination   .   \n\n    8.3.4.   Megha-Tropiques    \n\n    8.3.4.1.   Mission aim \n Megha-Tropiques    8  is a satellite whose aim is to improve our knowledge of the water \ncycle and atmospheric convection dynamics in the tropical atmosphere. \n\n The project is a cooperative effort between the French and the Indian space \nagencies (CNES and ISRO, respectively). The mission provides simultaneous mea-\nsurements of water vapor, clouds, condensed water, precipitation, and evaporation. \nConvection in the tropical region is a rapid and very energetic process that involves \nthe transport of water \u2013 whether as vapor, liquid, or solid \u2013 and that includes strong \nexchanges of energy between the different layers of the atmosphere. The mission \nwill study the characteristics and life cycle of tropical convection weather systems, \nand will provide products such as: cloud condensed water content; cloud ice con-\ntent; precipitation rates; latent heat release into the atmosphere; integrated atmo-\nspheric water vapor contents; radiative  fl uxes in the upper atmosphere; and \nsea-surface wind measurements. Megha-Tropiques    is planned to be launched in late \n2009 by an Indian PSLV launcher    into an 870 km altitude orbit with a low inclina-\ntion of 20\u00b0, so as to be permanently  fl ying over the tropics. The satellite is small \nwith a total mass of 900 kg.  \n\n    8.3.4.2.   Instruments \n The satellite carries three instruments   : the larger size MADRAS and the smaller \nSAPHIR and SCARAB. \n\n The conical scanning microwave imager    MADRAS is aimed at studying precipita-\ntion and cloud properties. The instrument\u2019s swath is 1,700 km. It features a parabolic \nantenna    with a diameter of 0.65 m, rotating at 25 rpm. MADRAS measures the rising \n\n   8   CNES Website   http://132.149.11.177/MEGHAT/index.htm    .  \n\nhttp://132.149.11.177/MEGHAT/index.htm\n\n\n199The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\nradiation produced by water and clouds in  fi ve frequencies; from 10.7 to 157 GHz. \nAll but one of the frequencies detects the horizontal and vertically polarized radia-\ntion. The spatial resolution    of the three lowest frequencies is 40 km; the spatial reso-\nlution of the highest is 6 km. The instrument contains a calibration    mirror used for \nregistering energy from the cold sky, focusing it onto the receiving horns. With the \nexception of the cold space    calibration mirror, the instrument rotates with respect to \nthe satellite (Figure  8.21 ), and carries protective structures    to improve the thermal \nstability    of the components in the path of the measured radiation. The lateral protec-\ntive surface features a large opening to allow visibility of deep space   . The instrument \nis relatively large and dominates the con fi guration    of the satellite. \n\n SAPHIR is a multichannelled passive microwave humidity sounder that provides \nhumidity pro fi les by measuring the brightness temperature in six different channels \nsituated close to the 183.31 GHz water vapor absorption line. The swath of SAPHIR \nis identical to that of MADRAS, but employs an across-track    scanning pattern. \n\n SCARAB is a cross-track passive multispectral scanning radiometer capable of \nsensing upper atmosphere infrared    radiation emitted by the Earth   . SCARAB mea-\nsures the energy emitted in four channels: the  fi rst provides the re fl ected solar irradi-\nance from 0.2 to 4  m m; the second, Earth emitted thermal radiation from 10.5 to 12.5 \n m m; a third channel registers the total irradiation from 0.2  m m to 200  m m. The last is \na visible light channel, which provides a geographical reference. Due to the scanning \ngeometry, points directly under the satellite\u2019s orbital track    possess better spatial reso-\nlution    (35 km) than other points. At the edge of the swath the resolution diminishes \nto 90 km (Figure  8.9 ).    \n\n  Figure 8.9.

Ulysses    \n\n    8.3.5.1.   Mission aim \n Ulysses    was launched in 1990 and it has been orbiting around the Sun    since that date. \nIt has helped the scientists to understand the Sun and its heliosphere   , and the Sun\u2019s \nin fl uence on the Earth   . It is the  fi rst satellite doing in situ    measurements of the inner \nheliosphere from the solar equator    to the solar poles. The orbit of Ulysses is heliocen-\ntric    with 1.35 AU of perigee    and 5.4 AU of apogee   . It is inclined with respect to the \necliptic plane    by 79.1\u00b0. The orbital period    is 6.2 years. To allow the observation of \nthe solar poles, the satellite required a large amount of energy to allow it to depart \nfrom the ecliptic plane near to which all the planet\u2019s orbital planes    are located.  \n\n    8.3.5.2.   Instruments \n Ulysses    is equipped with nine scienti fi c instruments    \u2013 some of them can be seen in \nFigure  8.10  \u2013 able to detect and measure solar wind    ions (SWOOPS) and electrons \n(HI-SCALE), magnetic  fi elds (VHM and FGM), energetic particles (EPAC), radio \nand plasma waves (UARP), dust, gas, and X and gamma rays (GRB). All these instru-\nments perform in situ    measurements, and are small, with masses in the range 2\u201315 \nkg. Large monopole (7.5 m) and dipole (72.5m) antennas detected lower-frequency \nelectric and plasma waves. The magnetic  fi eld is measured by two magnetometers   , a \nquantum detector (VHM), and a set of coils (FGM). Both magnetometers are located \non the tip of a long deployable boom in order to reduce the magnetic noise generated \nby the satellite platform    electronics   .     \n\n  Figure 8.10.

Observational needs as design drivers \n\n This chapter will analyze the whole spectral range of signals; from very low fre-\nquency, to microwave, optical to high-energy radiation. \n\n    8.4.1.   Observation frequency and atmosphere \n\n With very few exceptions \u2013 gravity    sensing is an example \u2013 observables    are detected \nby measuring electromagnetic effects. Electromagnetic effects can be differentiated \nby their frequency. \n\n Instruments observing different frequencies have different designs, require differ-\nent features, and belong to different engineering disciplines. Figure  8.11  provides an \noverview of the observation frequencies of the  fi ve missions described in Section  8.3  \nand of the  fi ve astronomical observatory    missions    introduced in Section   7.2.1    . These \ntwo sets of missions provide a good selection of observations over the whole electro-\nmagnetic spectrum   . Ulysses    radio and plasma wave experiments observe very low-\nfrequency variations of the surrounding electric  fi eld with a 72.5 m long wire antenna. \nMadras in Megha-Tropiques    observes in the microwave range and has a large rotating \nantenna requiring careful balance and dimensional stability    to avoid perturbation in \nthe host satellite platform   . All the infrared    instruments    (ISO   , JWST    Herschel,    and \nSentinel-3   \u2019s SLSTR instrument) observe in the infrared and require cooling    to very \nlow temperatures   . JWST also requires a very large deployable structure    to protect the \ninstrument from the heat of the Sun    and the Earth   . Hubble   , which observes in the \nvisible and infrared ranges, was dominated by the necessity for in-orbit servicing by \nastronauts, and the consequent obligatory compatibility with the Space Shuttle\u2019s \norbit. Aeolus   , which observes in the visible range, is shaped by the need for a tele-\nscope    with a large aperture.

Radiation Spectrum and Instruments    Observing at Different Frequencies.       \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n202 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nand are driven by the need for very high dimensional accuracy, a characteristic that \nbecomes more important as the observed frequency increases \u2013 the grazing incidence \nmirrors of XMM require dimensional accuracies better than 0.2 nm.  \n\n Earth   \u2019s atmosphere is transparent to radiation in some regions of the electromag-\nnetic spectrum    and opaque in others. In order to observe Earth from space, it is neces-\nsary to work at frequencies in which the atmosphere is reasonably transparent. \nFigure  8.11  shows the ranges available for doing so. Frequency ranges in which the \ntransparency alters rapidly can be used to study the vertical structure of the atmo-\nsphere: as the transparency decreases the radiation reaching the instrument will origi-\nnate from higher altitudes, and as the transparency increases the radiation will originate \nat lower altitudes; this permits the study of the variations along the observation path \nof parameters like atmospheric humidity and temperature. For astronomical observa-\ntions space instruments    represent the only option in frequency ranges where the atmo-\nsphere is opaque. This is the case with the Herschel   , ISO,    and XMM missions. \nSatellite-based astronomy also avoids atmospheric distortions at all frequencies. This \nis why there are space-based astronomy missions that observe over frequencies even \nwhere the atmosphere is transparent; Hubble    is a prime example of this. \n\n To analyze the impact of observation frequencies on space mission design, it is \ninstructive to compare similar instruments    working at different frequencies. Biomass \nand Cosmo-Skymed (Figure  8.12 ) are two SARs    requiring large antennas. Cosmo-\nSkymed is an Italian X-band    mission for the high-resolution observation of Earth   . It \ncan obtain images with a spatial resolution    of approximately 1 m. Biomass is a pro-\nposed P-band ESA mission for the global monitoring of woodlands and would pro-\nvide images with a spatial resolution of 50 m. The wavelength    of P-band is around \n69 cm; the wavelength of X-band SAR    is 3.1 cm. The dimensions governing both \ndesigns are scaled by the ratio of these wavelengths. A particular concept proposed \nfor Biomass at P-band requires the use of a 17.9 \u00d7 4.5 m antenna and its solar array    \nproduces 1 kW, while Cosmo-SkyMed needs a much smaller 5.7 \u00d7 1.4 m antenna, but \nneeds a larger solar array producing 3.8 kW.  \n\n The lower frequency of Biomass allows a lower level of antenna dimensional \nstability    but the antenna dimensions are very large. The higher frequency of Cosmo-\nSkymed uses a much smaller SAR    antenna but requires a much larger amount of \nemitted power requiring a larger-sized solar array   . The resulting satellite con fi gurations \nand con fi guration   -related problems are totally different for each mission.  \n\n  Figure 8.12.

Data quality \n\n Before discussing the different parameters measuring data quality it is necessary to \ndifferentiate between accuracy   , precision,    and resolution   . \n\n Accuracy can be de fi ned as the difference between the exact parameter under observa-\ntion and its recovered value. Precision can be de fi ned as the difference between repeated \nacquisitions of the same observation and resolution can be de fi ned as the smallest varia-\ntion of the observation that the instrument is able to detect. Some applications, for instance \nlong-term-sea-level change monitoring will require the determination of the ocean level \nwith high \u201cabsolute\u201d accuracy. Nevertheless, the recovery of other observables    \u2013 for \nexample, the detection of anomalous ocean dynamic topography (Section  8.5 ) associated \nwith ocean circulation    \u2013 requires detecting relative changes, and they will need good reso-\nlution but do not need good accuracy. Missions requiring high accuracies will be dif fi cult \nand demanding to implement because it will be necessary to implement tools ensuring the \nconstant and absolutely correct behavior of the instruments during the whole duration of \nthe mission. This will require complex instruments and complex calibration    of the instru-\nments. Missions asking for high precision will require keeping the instrument\u2019s behavior \nconstant during long periods, but it will be less demanding in terms of absolute calibra-\ntion. Missions requiring only good resolution are the least demanding and will tolerate \nslow drifts in the response of the instruments to the observables. \n\n It will be always compulsory to differentiate when the consumers    demand absolute \naccuracy and when it will be enough to provide them with good precision or resolu-\ntion. The architect    is in the right position to understand the real needs of the consum-\ners and the limitations of the supplier   \u2019s design. From this central perspective the \narchitect shall be responsible for correctly specifying the design so that underdesign \nand overdesign are both avoided. \n\n Data quality is determined by a mission\u2019s aims. There are the following classes of \nquality parameters:\n\n   Radiometric accuracy     \u2022 \n  Spectral quality     \u2022 \n  Spatial resolution     \u2022 \n  MTF     \u2022 \n  Temporal resolution: coverage    and revisit       \u2022 \n\n The following paragraphs describe these classes. \n\n    8.4.2.1.   Radiometric accuracy \n Radiometric accuracy is an instrument\u2019s capacity for providing correct readings of \nthe radiation intensity emitted by the observable   . To increase radiometric accuracy    \nthe ratio between the signal to be measured and the noise generated during the mea-\nsurement process must be increased. \n\n Increasing the aperture of the instrument can boost the signal strength   ; however, \nas we have seen, large apertures give rise to its own problems, namely, increased size \nand cost   . The use of multiple rows of detectors to observe the same targets increases \nthe integration time    as well as the radiometric quality   . Nevertheless, the use of this \ntechnique requires that the satellite\u2019s attitude be precisely monitored during the inte-\ngration period. This generates demanding attitude control    and recovery requirements; \n\n\n\n204 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nattitude control aspects will be examined in Chapter   9    . To reduce noise, the detector\u2019s \nquality must be improved, and the temperature of both the instrument and the detector \nmust be reduced. High-quality detectors are expensive and can be risky to develop. \nDetectors operating at low temperature require complex thermal design    and satellite \ncon fi gurations. This will be discussed in detail in Chapter   10    , but can be seen clearly \nin the con fi gurations of JWST    (Figure   7.10    ). \n\n To further improve radiometric quality    the relationship between the radiation \nintensity reaching the instrument and the read-out of the detectors must be accurately \ndetermined. Calibration    devices that generate a well-known radiative input to the \ninstrument determine this relationship. High-accuracy calibration    devices are com-\nplex and may require special lines of sight to the Sun    or outer space. This complicates \nthe instrument and satellite con fi guration   .  \n    8.4.2.2.   Spectral quality \n Spectral quality refers to the accuracy, width, and number of spectral bands    that the \ninstrument is able to recover: the better the spectral quality the better the capability \nof recovering useful information on the observable   . \n\n Spectral quality    requires the use of spectrometers    or  fi lters internal to the instru-\nment. Spectrometers disperse incoming radiation, which is then directed toward an \narray of detectors with different rows for different frequencies, allowing the sampling \nof the dispersed radiation. Filters are used to divide the incoming radiation and direct \nit to different focal planes: one focal plane    per  fi lter. Filters are small, but they require \none focal plane per band. Spectrometers can provide a large number of small-band-\nwidth    bands over a single matrix of detectors, but they are bulky and complex. In both \ncases, instruments    observing in many bands will be large. Instruments observing a \nlarge number of bands will also produce a large amount of data. Chapter   11     will ana-\nlyze the system-level implications of handling a very large data throughput   .  \n    8.4.2.3.   Spatial resolution \n Spatial resolution is the minimum distance between two adjacent features or the mini-\nmum size of a feature that can be detected by a remote sensing    system. Each spatial \nresolution    ground pixel is produced by the read-out of a single detector during the \nselected integration time   . In the case of pushbroom focal planes, to achieve a high \nspatial resolution with a large swath   , a long array with a large number of individual \ndetectors must be employed. In the case of whiskbroom    focal planes (see Figure  8.4 ), \nhigh scanning speeds are crucial. This entails complex scanning mechanisms    capable \nof moving at the necessary speed throughout the duration of the mission, implying a \nvery high reliability mechanism. In both cases the instruments    become more com-\nplex. The risk    and required development time of the mission will increase in those \ncases where the detector array    would involve dedicated development. \n\n Spatial resolution is also directly linked to the aperture diameter and instrument \nsize   . The diffraction limit    de fi nes the minimum aperture for an instrument able to \nprovide a given resolution at a given frequency. In microwave instruments    the diam-\neter of the aperture limits the resolution. The Madras microwave instrument provides \na spatial resolution    of 40 km at 10.7 GHz and of 6 km at 157 GHz. Instruments work-\ning in the optical bands are not normally diffraction limited: Ikonos    provides images \nwith 0.8 m resolution in the visible range from low Earth    orbit with an aperture \ndiameter of 0.5 m.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n205The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\n    8.4.2.4.   MTF    \n The modulation-transfer function (MTF   ) expresses the capability of an optical system \nto provide good contrast between progressively  fi ner maximum contrast stripes. \nResolution and contrast are in con fl ict because higher resolutions provide unavoidably \nlower contrast. The contrast would be a perfect 1 at zero resolution but it decreases as \nthe width of the stripes \u2013 hence the requested spatial resolution    \u2013 becomes  fi ner. The \nquality of an optical system is indicated by its MTF value at the  fi nest resolution of the \nsystem. MTF goes from 1 (perfect contrast) to 0 (no contrast). Values of MTF of the \norder of 0.3 at the maximum spatial resolution are considered reasonable.  \n    8.4.2.5.   Temporal resolution: coverage and revisit \n To be able to understand the events under observation the mission should be designed \nto track their dynamics. Many events may be considered stable and only need to be \nobserved once during the duration of the mission. In other cases the events are vari-\nable and need to be observed often enough to characterize how they change over time. \nThe weather changes quickly and meteorology requires refreshed global views of the \natmosphere every couple of hours, while global ocean circulation    changes slowly and \noceanographers requires refreshed global ocean views every couple of days. \n\n The time elapsed between two consecutive observations of the same area will \nde fi ne the temporal resolution    of the observations provided by the mission. \n\n Some missions require the systematic delivery of synoptic views    covering large \nareas of interest   . In extreme cases the area of interest    can extend to the whole Earth    \nor celestial sphere   . In these cases, temporal resolution must provide repetitive whole \ncoverage    of the designated areas. To deliver rapid coverage of large areas, the mission \nmust provide a wide swath. If a single satellite is unable to provide the required cov-\nerage in the required time, several satellites operating simultaneously will be needed. \nThis is the case with Sentinel-3    (Section  8.3.3 ), which requires two satellites to ful fi ll \nits coverage requirements. Design for optimal coverage is an important topic that will \nbe discussed in detail in Section   9.9.3     of the next chapter when discussing orbit and \nattitude. The coverage requirement directly shapes the instrument swath    and mission \ndata throughput   . \n\n In other cases, the consumer    might only be interested in observing speci fi c and \nlocalized, swiftly evolving events such as  fl oods, forest  fi res,    or energetic astronomic \nevents. In these situations the instrument can feature a small swath within a wider pos-\nsible pointing    range    and the instrument must be as long as possible pointed in the \nappropriate direction. In such cases good temporal resolution will require frequent \nrevisit    of the speci fi c area of interest   , and the satellite must have an optimal orbit and \npointing range, though a large swath    is not necessary. Design for optimal revisits is \nalso discussed in Section   9.9.3    . Revisit missions require smaller swaths and produce \nsmaller amounts of data, but their operation is very complex and interactive as required \nby the need to command the satellite to point in the varying required directions. This \nentails intense dialog between the satellite and mission operations    segment on the \nground. The implications of this dialog will be discussed in Section  8.4.5  below. \n\n Optical instruments    observing the Earth    will be able to operate only without \nclouds and with good Sun    illumination. In these cases it will be necessary to differ-\nentiate between the theoretical revisit    or coverage and the actual one that takes into \naccount the clouds and the illumination conditions.   \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n206 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    8.4.3.   Image distortion \n\n Instruments observing the Earth    and having a large swath    or a wide pointing    range    \nwill inevitably scrutinize areas in which the geometry of the observation is distorted. \nSatellites covering horizon to horizon can observe the entire Earth in a single day, but \nthis rapid revisiting will be paid for with degraded radiometric quality    and diminished \nresolution at the edge of the swath. Nonetheless, in situations where the time resolu-\ntion of the mission is of utmost importance, the quality degradation associated with \nthe image distortion can be tolerated. This situation occurs in operational meteoro-\nlogical    observations from low Earth orbit     fl ying at an altitude of about 800 km. At \nthis altitude, the ground pixel size \u2013 the spatial sampling distance \u2013 will be degraded \nby a factor of two with off-Nadir    angles (Figures  8.13  and  8.14 ) of the order of 47\u00b0. \nAt this height, the Earth\u2019s horizon will be perceived at an angle of 62.7\u00b0; at the hori-\nzon the distortion of the pixel will be in fi nite.   \n\nSSD vs ONA for a constant SSA\n\nONA (\u00b0)\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n  Figure 8.13.

Being the Earth a Sphere, a Large Swath Instrument Will Have Progressively \nMore Distorted Images as the Observing Area Moves Away From the Nadir \nSub-Satellite Direction.       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n207The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\n Observations near the edge of the swath are degraded not only as regards spatial \nresolution    but also as regards radiometric quality   . This is because the radiation being \nmonitored reaches the instrument after having traveled through a much longer distance \nwithin the atmosphere than those originating near the center of the swath. So signals reach \nthe instrument contaminated by large amounts of solar radiation scattered by the atmo-\nsphere. Illumination from the Sun    will also vary from one edge to the other, and from \nthese to the center of any large instrument swath   . This introduces a supplementary element \nof quality degradation to any image. A satellite observing the Earth    from the geostationary \nposition (Section   9.4.4    ) will provide poorer images at higher latitudes than nearer the \nequator   . The geostationary orbi   t is located over the equator and at an altitude of 35,786 \nkm. At this distance the satellite will point to the edge of the Earth with an off-Nadir    angle \nof 8.7\u00b0, the Earth latitude coinciding with the horizon is seen by the satellite at 81.3\u00b0. As \nthe pixel approaches nearer to the horizon, it becomes more and more distorted \n(Figure  8.15 ).  \n\n The maximum acceptable distortion will depend on the application. Figure  8.16  \ndemonstrate that incidence angles as high as 60\u00b0 provide \u201cuseful\u201d images where \nshapes can be still detected. Nevertheless in applications requiring a very high radio-\nmetric quality   , for example, to detect different types of vegetation, the usable inci-\ndence angle    will be smaller. The experts will determine the maximum value \nacceptable for each application.   \n\n    8.4.4.   Data quantity \n\n Instruments carried by a satellite produce an output data stream. The amount of data \nproduced depends on the number of pixels covered per unit of time, as well as on the \n\n  Figure 8.15.

Hence, instrument data throughput    will \nincrease with:\n\n   Is the information acquired over a point or over larger or smaller areas? This \u2022 \nde fi nes the area of the observation, and the operational swath    of the instrument.  \n  Are the phenomena under study subject to rapid spatial changes, so that changes \u2022 \noccurring over small distances must be resolved in order to understand them? This \nde fi nes the spatial resolution    of the observation.  \n  Is the phenomena characterized by a highly variable intensity, so that highly accu-\u2022 \nrate measurements of both very small and very large quantities are necessary? This \nde fi nes the dynamic range    of the observation.  \n  Do the phenomena under study emit radiation at many different frequencies, and is \u2022 \nit necessary to characterize the phenomena to study this frequency behavior in \ndetail? This de fi nes the spectral ranges and spectral resolution    of the observations.    \n\n The instrument\u2019s swath depends on coverage requirements   , as discussed in the \nprevious section. Observing global, dynamic targets demands rapid coverage and \nimplies the generation of large amounts of data. The necessary spatial resolution    will \nalso be determined by the nature of the observable   . Some observables    can be ade-\nquately characterized by observing them with just one frequency, while other events \nmust be observed in more than one band. A single-band \u201cblack and white\u201d image is \ncapable of resolving man-made objects such as roads, buildings, or aircraft, but many \nbands are necessary to derive complex products like the amount of chlorophyll in \ncoastal waters, or to differentiate between young and mature woodlands. Higher radio-\nmetric resolutions increase data throughput    because enhanced resolution requires more \nbits per pixel. High spatial and radiometric resolution, high swath, and the recovery of \nmany bands are desirable features in any instrument; but reducing the data throughput \ndirectly impacts these desirable features. The consumer   \u2019s desire for the highest pos-\nsible data throughput can easily be interpreted as a request for higher than possible \ndata throughput. High-resolution imagers    are notoriously heavy data generators, and \na modern high-resolution SAR    can produce up to 1 Gb/s. The transmission to Earth    \nof such a quantity of data is dif fi cult and the downlink    capacity of the satellite can \nturn into a bottleneck for the whole mission. The only solution would be to limit the \n\n  Figure 8.16.

Data downlink problems are compounded by international regulations on \nbandwidth    availability and by the relatively brief ground contacts    available from low \nEarth orbit   . Sentinel-3    is not a high-resolution mission; nevertheless, it employs nearly \nall the data downlink bandwidth capacity allowed by international regulations, and \nrequires one contact with the ground on every orbit (Section   12.3.3    ). Satellites in \nhigher orbit achieve more contact time, but the longer distance from satellite to ground \nis an additional factor limiting data throughput. These limitations will be discussed in \nChapter   12    . One possible solution for overcoming a data throughput bottleneck is to \nincrease the number of satellites. This was discussed in Section   7.3.1     above. One \nsupplementary advantage of providing improved coverage by increasing the number \nof satellites is that it becomes possible to ful fi ll the consumer\u2019s desires with instru-\nments    requiring a smaller swath, smaller incidence angles at the edge of the swath, \nwith less spatial distortion, and more ef fi cient correction of atmospheric effects. All \nthis will increase image quality. Another possibility to reduce data throughput is to \nimplement data compression   . This will be discussed in Section   12.4.4    . \n\n In situ instruments as in Ulysses    (Section  8.3.5 ) and sounders as in Aeolus    \n(Section  8.3.1 ) do not have any swath and produce moderate amounts of data. In situ \ninstruments    characterize the observable\u2019s spatial variation by monitoring different \npoints as they travel along their orbit. If the observables    are dynamic in both space \nand time the consumer    will have dif fi culties distinguishing between space or time \nvariations. The only way to properly discriminate between them is to use multiple \nsatellites. With multiple satellites it becomes possible to measure spatial variations by \ncomparing the simultaneous measurements of the different instruments, such as with \nthe Cluster    mission (Section   11.4.1    ), which consists of four satellites studying swiftly \nchanging events in the magnetosphere    of the Earth   .  \n\n    8.4.5.   Systematic versus interactive observation \n\n As regards the study of observables   , the speci fi c areas of interest    to be observed will \nbe predictable in some cases while in others they will be unpredictable. The observ-\ning patterns of operational meteorology    or oceanography are perfectly predictable \nand the instrument\u2019s task is to repeatedly cover the entire globe or ocean. This same \ndegree of predictability applies to missions whose aim is to survey larger or smaller \nareas such as an entire planet, the dry land, or known areas of the celestial sphere    \nwhere some astronomical feature needs to be studied. Examples of events that cannot \nbe predicted beforehand include  fl oods, forest  fi res,    or the sudden appearance of a \nsupernova. In cases like these, the mission must be able to quickly react over the \nconsumers   \u2019 possibly con fl icting requests. \n\n For predictable targets the observational approach will be uniform, repetitive, and \nsimple. For unpredictable ones the approach must be interactive, that is, it becomes \nnecessary to periodically decide where and how to carry out the observation and to \ncommand the satellite to do so; hence, operations will be more complex. With the \nexception of JWST   , all the missions described in Section  8.4  are systematic   , while the \nastronomical observatory    missions    discussed in Section   7.2     are all interactive   . In the \nlatter case, astronomers will make requests to observe speci fi c targets; a scienti fi c \nreview team will judge the requests according to their scienti fi c merits; satellite \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n210 Introduction to Space Systems\n\noperations    engineers will analyze them from the point of view of satellite resources \nand pointing    capabilities. Together they will draw up an observation plan accepting \nsome requests and rejecting others. Finally, the observation plan    will be sent to the \nsatellite for execution. These steps involve intense collaboration among the science \nand operations teams and the users. \n\n Both swiftly changing and slowly changing or static targets can entail complex \ninteraction. What makes a mission interactive is not so much the observable   \u2019s speed or \nrelative activity, as its unpredictably. Most astronomers making use of the missions \ndescribed in Section   7.2     are not studying quickly changing events; however, these mis-\nsions\u2019 operating plans undergo constant modi fi cation. Their organizational complexity \narises from the need to allocate a scare resource \u2013 observation time \u2013 among a large \nnumber of competing users with con fl icting observation needs. Quickly changing \ndynamic observables    requiring global monitoring, on the other hand, demand swift, \nglobal coverage. As a consequence, these missions could require many satellites with \nlarge swaths. Operations, however, will be relatively simple, with continuously func-\ntioning instruments   . Operational meteorology    offers a good example of space missions \nwith demanding coverage requirements    but straightforward systematic    observational \noperations. There are some missions that combine both types of observation, such as a \ncelestial survey of the entire sky in the  fi rst part of the mission, in which operations are \nsystematic, followed by imaging speci fi c targets of interest at the consumer   \u2019s request \n\n The main design criteria for systematic observations    are:\n\n   In order to study the dynamics of the observable    the mission must be capable of \u2022 \nsurveying the area of interest    \u2013 for example, the whole Earth    or celestial sphere    \n\u2013 within a speci fi ed period of time. This is the speed of coverage requirement   . The \nspeed of coverage will determine the instrument\u2019s swath.  \n  The satellite and instrument con fi guration   , as well as the orbit must provide the \u2022 \nnecessary coverage of the target area within the required interval. The instrument\u2019s \nobserving pattern may be broad or narrow, but will always be repetitive.  \n  Operations will be simple, observing pattern updates rare and under normal cir-\u2022 \ncumstances the uplinking    of commands infrequent.    \n\n The main design criteria for interactive observations    are:\n\n   The system must be capable of responding quickly to speci fi c observation \u2022 \nrequests. Two parameters must be speci fi ed: a speed of response, \u201creactiveness\u201d \nor response time, i.e., the time interval from reception of the request to the  fi rst \nobservation and a \u201crevisit   \u201d requirement for regulating the frequency that informa-\ntion is updated.  \n  To track the dynamics of the event under observation, the mission must be able to \u2022 \nrevisit    within a speci fi ed period of time. This will de fi ne the ideal orbit and instru-\nment pointing    range   .  \n  The satellite\u2019s swath    is governed by the size of the dynamic event or by the need \u2022 \nfor a wider context area around the event.  \n  Instrument and satellite operations    involve the creation and updating of complex \u2022 \nacquisition plans reconciling consumer    needs with satellite constraints.  \n  Instrument observing patterns will be highly variable. Instrument con fi guration    \u2022 \nand satellite attitude control    must be designed to provide pointing     fl exibility.     \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n211The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\n    8.4.6.   Responsiveness, acquisition delay, and latency    \n\n Instruments acquire information about events. Consumers    would like to avail \nthemselves of this information as quickly as possible, but delivery delays are \nunavoidable. All information passes through various phases: it must be requested; \nplanned, uplinked; acquired; downlinked    to the ground; processed on the ground; and \ndistributed to the consumers. These steps can be faster or slower depending on the \ndesign of the mission. Figures of merit, assessing speed of data delivery to consumers \nmust be formulated. Parameters like revisit    and coverage were already discussed but \nthree further parameters must now be de fi ned (Figure  8.17 ): \n\n   Latency     \u2022 \n  Acquisition delay     \u2022 \n  Total system responsiveness       \u2022 \n\n The time elapsed between data acquisition and data delivery is the data\u2019s latency   . \nThe existence of data latency    requirements and the time allocated to this latency will \ndepend on the nature of the observable    and the utilization of the data. Some applica-\ntions will demand the fast delivery of acquired data while others can tolerate longer \ndata latencies. Operational observation of dynamic events demands short data latency, \nbecause it will be used for real-time decision making but scienti fi c utilization, which \nrequires deliberate study of the data, does not normally have demanding latency \nrequirements. Aeolus    (Section  8.3.1 ) data could be used either to improve our under-\nstanding of the physics of the atmosphere or to help predict the actual evolution of \nthe weather. In the former case, long data latency would pose no problems for scien-\ntists; in the second case, however, the data needs to be made available as quickly as \npossible if it is to be integrated into weather forecasting models, so short data latency \nis crucial. Sentinel-3    (Section  8.3.3 ) provides synoptic views    of the Earth    every \ncouple of days, but the data is delivered within 3 h of being acquired. These delays \nare compatible with the study of dynamic processes of moderate speed such as ocean \ncirculation    or vegetation growth. Data latency requirements are fundamental to the \n\nRequest Planning Uplink Orbit Acquisition n Orbit Downlink Basic Processing Value Adding Processing Delivery\n\nOrbit Acquisition n+1\n\nRevisit\n\nTotal system responsiveness\n\nAcquisition delay Latency\n\nTimeline\n\n  Figure 8.17.

The acceptance and processing of the demands depends \non the design of the operational ground segment    and the uplink to the satellite of the \nrequest for data acquisition depends on the choice of operational ground stations    and \nof the orbit. The operational ground segment and ground stations will be discussed in \nChapter   11    , and the orbit in Chapter   9    . The time needed for the satellite to arrive to \nthe right orbital position depends exclusively on the orbit and the time necessary for \nthe satellite to point correctly to the target will depend on the performances of the \nagility    of the attitude control    of the satellite. Scienti fi c missions studying fast tran-\nsient events need also fast reaction   ; they required a very low acquisition delay. The \nItalian gamma ray observatory \u201cAgile   \u201d 9  has a very short delay time by the nature of \nits targets, i.e., gamma ray bursts. Its delay time is typically a few minutes from \nrequest to acquisition of the requested image. \n\n The total system responsiveness    from request to delivery is computed by the addi-\ntion of the delay; acquisition; and latency intervals. The total responsiveness    is deter-\nmined by the addition of the requirements in each one of its components. For some \nkinds of missions one or another of these time intervals could be absent: systematic \nmissions will have no acquisition delay   , while missions requiring a single observation \nwill have no revisit   . Nevertheless, all observations require downlinking    and process-\ning, which means that all missions feature some form of latency   . \n\n To improve total responsiveness    it is necessary to have ef fi cient operations and fast \ndata processing and distribution. Nevertheless the delay will also depend on the opportu-\nnities to communicate between the ground stations    and the satellite, and the opportunities \nfor the satellite to observe the areas requested. All these opportunities are a rigid function \nof the orbital geometry, the number of satellites, and the choice of ground stations.  \n\n    8.4.7.   Observations and rotation of the line of sight    \n\n Remote sensing instruments    acquire images over areas of interest   . In most cases the \narea of interest    is too large to be captured by an individual image, so to properly cover \nthe whole area the mission must regularly produce a mosaic of images. To accomplish \nthis, all the images must be properly orientated. This means that not only must the \ninstrument point in the direction of the target but the satellite\u2019s orientation with \nrespect to the target line of sight    shall allow the proper concatenation of the different \nimages or strips of images. \n\n This additional constraint    on the satellite\u2019s attitude limits the design possibilities \nof the satellite\u2019s con fi guration   . All instruments    producing regular synoptic views    pos-\nsess this constraint of orientation.  \n\n   9    AGILE a Satellite for High-Energy Gamma Ray Astrophysics, Bignami and Palumbo, Advances in Space \nResearch Volume 31 Issue 2 2003, Elsevier Science 2003.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n213The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\n    8.4.8.   Instrument interfaces \n\n A satellite\u2019s platform    subsystems provide all essential services to the instruments   ; after \nall, it is the instruments that perform the actual observations that justify the mission. \nIn order to formalize this concept, a document must be drawn up specifying the services \nthat the satellite will provide to the instruments. During the early design stages it will \nbe necessary to modify and adjust the design of the instrument, the satellite itself and the \nmission\u2019s operational processes. Once a convergence has been reached among these three \nelements, it becomes possible to produce a de fi nitive payload interface requirements \ndocument. A comprehensive set of instrument interface requirements    will include:\n\n   Permitted instrument mass    and mass properties, for both the launch and in-orbit \u2022 \noperational con fi gurations.  \n  Instrument volume envelope for both the launch and in-orbit operational \u2022 \ncon fi gurations.

Instruments \nsensing the electromagnetic  fi eld will require magnetic or electric limitations on the \nsatellite, and gravity    sensing instruments will require limitations in the accelerations \nwithin the satellite. \n\n During a project\u2019s early stages it is unnecessary and even unwise to establish a rigid \nset of interface requirements that the instrument must request from the satellite. Before \na project is approved, mission requirements    and mission design interact; likewise, instru-\nment design that of the overall satellite design must interact and  fi nd mutually acceptable \nsolutions. Only when this preliminary accommodation process has ended will it be nec-\nessary to formalize the interfaces between the instruments and the rest of the satellite.   \n\n    8.5.   End-to-end performance as design driver \n\n Section   3.4     introduced the concepts of value engineering   , mission utility metrics, and \nend-to-end mission performances    simulators. The present section will retake the con-\ncept of end-to-end performance and illustrate it with examples built around the instru-\nments discussed in this chapter. \n\n Although the present chapter has moved from a focus on observables    to a focus on \ninstruments   , in order to provide a true estimation of mission value, we must return to \nthe observables. To provide \u201cthe set of information that de fi nes a system\u2019s value, cost \nand risk suf fi ciently for the purposes of the sponsor   \u201d it is necessary to develop a tool \nfor measuring the quality of the  fi nal products derived from the instrument\u2019s data. \nThis tool is the end-to-end mission performances simulator. \n\n The end-to-end performances simulator should include modules that model the \nbehavior of the instruments, the rest of the satellite, and the on-ground processing; \nbut it should also include modules for analyzing how the instrument\u2019s data can be \ntransformed into information valuable for the mission\u2019s consumer   . This requires the \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1-3\n\n\n215The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\ncollaboration of experts from widely different space engineering  fi elds, as well as \nfrom the sciences related to the observables    and to the consumer. \n\n The end-to-end mission simulation tool has a dual aim:\n\n    \u2022 It allows the breakdown of the overall mission performance      into derived \nrequirements allocated to the mission\u2019s elements and components . That is, by \nemploying the simulation tool top-down   , it acts as a design tool allowing the deter-\nmination of the allocation of requirements corresponding to the optimal designs.  \n   \u2022 It allows deriving end-to-end performance from the performance of the \nmission elements and components . That is, by employing the tool bottom-up   , it \nacts as a veri fi cation tool, providing a measure of overall mission value.    \n\n The existence of an end-to-end model permits the swift assessment of \u201cwhat-if\u201d \nscenarios, by analyzing the impact on  fi nal mission performances of design \nmodi fi cations made with the intention of reducing costs. The end-to-end model also \nfacilitates the analysis of alternative concepts that ful fi ll the same requirements with \nwidely different architectures; for example, radiometric accuracy    provided by means \nof sophisticated on-board calibration    tools in contrast to their provision by extensive \non-ground processing. \n\n Radar altimetry for ocean circulation    offers a good example for understanding \nend-to-end modeling because the process is long and complex and involves widely \ndifferent science and engineering disciplines. Yet, after two decades of radar altime-\ntry   , it is a domain in which both the basic science and detailed implementation pro-\ncedures are well settled. In ocean circulation, the oceans can be divided into a large \nnumber of small interacting cells. The laws of physics related to the dynamics of \n fl uids govern the interactions between these cells. These cells will have properties \nsuch as temperature and salinity, together with dynamical characteristics governing \nthe exchanges between cells, such as the water\u2019s velocity, among many others. If it is \npossible to de fi ne the properties of all the cells at an initial instant, a numerical model \nmay be employed to predict the evolution in time of these properties. Based upon data \nacquired at frequent intervals, such models are able to predict the probable evolution \nby simulating the behavior of the cells, under constraints imposed by the laws of \nphysics, the characteristics of the ocean\u2019s initial state derived from measurement data, \nand by boundary conditions like the geography of the coast and the intensity and \ndirection of winds or currents. \n\n By redistributing water    around the globe, ocean currents distort the ocean surface \nfrom a position of equilibrium that it would adopt were the whole ocean at rest. This \ntheoretical surface is called the \u201cgeoid\u201d and it constitutes the absolute reference or \nequipotential surface of the Earth   \u2019s gravity     fi eld. Any differences between the local \nwater level and the reference geoid represent sea-surface anomalies. These anomalies \nin sea level may be mapped, and the shapes of contours or slopes of the ocean surface \nmay be used to determine the movement of the ocean at any point, and thus determine \nthe ocean\u2019s currents. This implies that the fundamental observations required for \npredicting the dynamics of ocean currents are precise observations of local sea-\nsurface anomalies. Today satellite radar altimeters can provide measurements of \nthese sea-surface anomalies. \n\n Radar altimeters    determine sea-surface height and sea-level anomalies by sending \na radar signal to the ocean surface and measuring the time needed for the signal \nto return. This interval provides the distance from the satellite to the water level. \n\n\n\n216 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nThe radar altimeter    specialist will provide algorithms to simulate the performance of \nthe radar. Knowing the radar signal\u2019s speed it is possible to transform the delay into \ndistance (Figure  8.18 ).  \n\n The speed of the signal depends on the ion density in the ionosphere and the atmo-\nsphere\u2019s density and water vapor content, and determination of these parameters is \nessential. In Sentinel-3   , the microwave radiometer (MWR) instrument recovers the \nwater vapor content of the local atmosphere. The ion density is measured by the \ncomparing the return delay \u2013 which is a function of the band and of the ion density \n\u2013 in two bands: Ku and C. The behavior of these supplementary components shall be \nmodeled in the end-to-end simulation   , which should also include realistic models of \natmospheric pressure and atmospheric humidity. The next step entails correcting for \nthe inverse barometer effect; that is, the impact of low or high atmospheric pressure \non local ocean sea levels   . This correction requires excellent high-resolution models \nof the global atmospheric pressure. Meteorologists shall deliver these models. The \ninteraction between the ocean surface and the radar pulses depends on wave activity, \nand the correct appraisal of ocean levels requires a priori knowledge of waves. \nOceanographers and atmospheric modelers are responsible for providing this a priori \ninformation. After all these corrections have been made, the true distance from the \nsatellite to the water surface can be calculated. An on-board high-accuracy GPS    \nreceiver or another tool for calculating precise orbital coordinates will permit the \nderivation of the satellite\u2019s orbit and derive the ocean sea-surface anomaly with \nrespect to an absolute reference frame. The last step will be to correct water-level \nalterations generated by the tides using models of the tide. The  fi nal output of this \nlong cascade of calculations will be the end-to-end performance as regards sea-sur-\nface anomalies, which are the observables    for oceanography. \n\n A clear problem for any end-to-end performance simulation model is the handling \nof interfaces between the different submodels that it includes.

The prompt identi fi cation of all formal interface requirements    that would \nallow all the submodels to run and communicate concurrently inside the same end-\nto-end model and in the same machine is a crucial early step.  \n\n    8.6.   Allocation of functions \n\n The instrument is the heart of the mission and shapes the design of all other mission \ncomponents. Given this fact, it seems logical to leave the analysis of the impact gen-\nerated by the instruments    for future chapters that will discuss the different possibili-\nties for answering the instrument-generated design drivers. \n\n This section will proceed to analyze the allocation of functions    and design deci-\nsions that cannot be discussed properly in any of the future chapters. \n\n    8.6.1.   Scanning \n\n Instruments need to cover an area of interest   . The area of interest might be much \nlarger than the instrument\u2019s instantaneous  fi eld of view   , so it must be capable of scan-\nning    to achieve total coverage. Scanning and pointing    were introduced in Figure  8.3  \nof Section  8.2.1 , as was the concept of the \u201cimage cube\u201d with its three dimensions: \nalong-track swath; across-track    swath; and spectral dimension. Figure  8.3  provided \nan example of how it is possible to point or scan by pointing the whole satellite    or by \nusing pointing mirrors   . Figure  8.4  indicated that the movement of the satellite along \nits orbit provides along-track swath for the instrument. These topics will be expanded \nin this section (Figure  8.19 ).  \n\n The scanning    function can be performed by the instrument, the satellite or the \nmovement of the satellite along its orbit. If the instrument provides the scanning, then \ndesign decisions on scanning, i.e., selection of bearings, motors, or control electron-\nics   , become internal to the instrument and of interest mainly to the specialist. \nHowever, two aspects have important system-level implications: size increases and \nmechanical perturbations   . \n\n The pointing    mirror must be able to illuminate the aperture of the instrument in all \nthe positions required for the delivery of the swath (Figure  8.20 ). This obliges the \nmirror to be larger than the aperture, and space must be allocated for the enlarged \nmirror and to allow movement between the points corresponding to the two extremes \nof the swath. Due to the need for additional space, pointing mirrors    are only advisable \nfor instruments    with small or moderate apertures. Large swath, moderate resolution \noptical instruments, on the other hand, use mirrors because moderate resolution is \ncompatible with moderate aperture. Sentinel-3   \u2019s SLSTR instrument is a good exam-\nple of this type of instrument, which uses pointing mirrors for scanning. Nonetheless, \nall the telescopes described in Section   7.2     \u2013 IUE   , Hubble   , ISO   , XMM, Herschel,    and \nJWST    \u2013 have a large aperture and are pointed by the whole satellite. The decision in \nfavor of pointing with the instrument or pointing with the satellite has a major impact \non satellite con fi guration   .  \n\n The scanning of the mirror will introduce mechanical perturbations    in the rest of \nthe satellite. These perturbations must be limited to avoid disturbing the pointing    \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n218 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nPhase delay of individual measurement \n\nDynamic topography correction \n\nTides aliasing correction \n\nOcean geoid model by geodesy\n\nPhase delay of integrated measurement \n\nIonosphere delay corrections \n\nAtmospheric humidity delay corrections\n\nDry atmosphere sea level correction \n\nSea state bias level correction \n\nCorrection for true position of the GNSS\nsatellites and true position of the satellite\n\nDry atmosphere delay correction \n\nFinal ocean currents recovery\nperformance\n\nRadar altimetry design by radar engineering \n\nRadar altimetry integration time by radar engineering \n\nIonosphere model and altimeter dual frequency\nby radar engineering and geophysics\n\nAtmosphere humidity model and on-board microwave\nradiometer by microwave engineering and meteorology\n\nWaves model and backscatter ocean behavior model by\noceanographers and ocean radiation interaction\n\nOn-board navigation payload, GNSS satellite ephemeris and\nprecise orbit determination by orbital mechanics engineering\n\nTides modelling by oceanography and geophysics\n\nMultiple satellites correction \n\nOcean circulation model by oceanography \n\nMultiple satellite constellation modeling\nby multidisciplinary teams\n\nAtmospheric pressure and\ntemperature model by meteorology\n\nAtmospheric pressure and\ntemperature model by meteorology\n\n  Figure 8.19.

The resulting mechanical perturbations budget is mainly an \nattitude control    issue and will be discussed in detail in Section   9.8    . Perturbations can \nbe especially severe in cases where there is an oscillating movement of the scanning \nmirror. \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n219The Observables and Instruments Domain\n\n The rotation axis    of the instrument\u2019s scan can be centered on the satellite\u2019s velocity \nvector   , or around the Nadir    direction. In the former case, the swath line will be straight \nand perpendicular to the satellite\u2019s ground track   ; the instrument will be an across-\nscanner. This is the case of SAPHIR and SCARAB, instruments aboard Megha-\nTropiques    (Section  8.3.4 ). MADRAS has a conical scan axis around the Nadir \ndirection. In the case of conical scanners the distance and the geometry from the instru-\nment to the ground pixel is the same for all the points of the swath and the shape and \nsize of the all the ground pixels of the swath are always the same, resulting in better \ndata quality (Figure  8.21 ). Across-track scanners are easier to implement but produce \nimage distortions when pointing    away from the Nadir direction (Section  8.4.3 ).  \n\n Geostationary    satellites (Section   9.4.4    ) have a  fi xed geometry with respect to the \nEarth   \u2019s surface, and the movement of the satellite along its orbit does not produce \nswath. To cover the area of interest   , geostationary satellites need to provide physical \nscanning in two dimensions. Figure  8.22  provides two possible implementations. In \nthe  fi rst, there are two sets of pointing    mirrors   : the  fi rst set provides scanning by vary-\ning the longitude at constant latitude. This provides an image strip roughly parallel to \nthe equator   . The second mechanism changes the latitude of the strip obtained by the \n fi rst mechanism. This implementation requires a set of linear detector arrays   : one per \nfrequency of observation. In the second alternative the focal plane    of the instrument \nis a large matrix of detectors. The different bands are recovered by using a rotating \nwheel with  fi lters that intercept the optical path to the focal plane. In this case the \nscanning will be accomplished through the satellite changing its attitude for each \nimage. The result will be the creation of a mosaic from the relatively large individual \nimages captured by the large matrix array. The mosaic can be created by a \u201cstep-and-stare\u201d \n\n  Figure 8.21.

Spinning provides a \nthird possibility; where the spin of the satellite can be used to provide scan along the \nlatitude lines. This is the case of MSG    (Figure   7.3    ).  \n\n Of the  fi ve missions discussed in Section  8.3 , Aeolus    does not scan, JWST    scans \nby pointing    the whole satellite    in the required direction, and Ulysses    does not need to \nscan because it carries in situ    instruments   . Megha-Tropiques    and Sentinel-3    have \ninstruments that scan by using mechanisms internal to the instrument. \n\n The satellite as a whole can also do scanning and pointing   . This simpli fi es the \ninstrument but complicates the con fi guration    of the satellite. The resulting issues will \nbe analyzed in Section   10.5.5    .  \n\n    8.6.2.   Internal and external calibration \n\n Calibration    is directly related to the quality of the instrument output and to the end-\nto-end mission performance   . The calibration    approach to the instrument is another \ndesign decision that needs to be taken by the architect    the consumer    and the instru-\nment design specialist. The architect needs to be aware of the in fl uence of the calibra-\ntion on the overall mission design, and which interfaces it generates. \n\n Instruments requiring superior radiometric quality    need to include calibration    \nhardware as part of the instrument. Calibration components include sources that pro-\nduce a well-known, stable signal that illuminates the detectors. The comparison \nbetween the measured output and the known input serves to calibrate the instrument \nthroughout the mission. In some cases the source of well-known radiation will be \nexternal: the Sun   ; the Moon   ; deep space;    or uniform parts of the Earth   \u2019s surface. \nThese external calibration sources could require special periodic pointing    attitudes by \nthe instrument or the satellite. This has implications for the physical design    of the \nsatellite; for example, the need to provide a clean  fi eld of view    to the Sun for realizing \nthe calibration. \n\nTelescope Telescope\n\nTelescope\n\nStrip filters\nand 1D\n\ndetectors\n\nFilter wheel\n\n2D\ndetector\n\nScan mirror\n\nImages\n\nInstantaneous\nfield of view \n\nSet of 1D\ndetectors\n\nAttitude 1, 2, 3, 4 \n\nInstantaneous\nfield of view\n\nSet of 1D\ndetectors\n\n1 2 \n\n3 4 \n\nImages\n\n  Figure 8.22.

Comparison of the distinct results can be of bene fi t to all of them. This \napproach is sometimes called \u201cexternal validation   \u201d to distinguish it from \u201cinternal \ncalibration   \u201d which operates inside the bounds of the space system. The architect    shall \nbe aware of any need for external validation because it requires the establishment of \nagreements with the external sources, or the assurance that the external sources are \nreally stable over the duration of the mission.  \n\n    8.6.3.   Solid aperture versus deployable versus synthetic aperture \n\n As repeated many times in this chapter, the key parameter in any remote sensing    \ninstrument is the size of its aperture   . The dimensions of a lens, mirror, or antenna \nde fi ne the aperture. If this component is built in one piece, its dimensions must ful fi ll \nthe aperture-size requirement. If the required aperture is larger than the space available \nin the launcher   , it is possible to use mechanisms    that deploy the necessary hardware \nrequired to attain the required operational aperture after launch. The choice of  fi xed \nversus deployable is one of the most important factors in the con fi guration    of the \ninstrument and the satellite as a whole. The comparison of the Hubble    Space Telescope \nand JWST    con fi gurations (Section   7.2.1    ) demonstrates the radical changes in satellite \ndesign as a consequence of this decision. This will be discussed extensively in Section \n  10.5.2    . Synthesis of an aperture is another technique for increasing the dimensions of \nthe instrument aperture. Due to the longer wavelengths they observe, aperture synthe-\nsis    has developed faster in microwave than in optical observation. Synthetic aperture \nradars were introduced in Section  8.2.4 . Synthetic and real aperture instruments    per-\nforming similar observations create different types of design and interface problems \nfor the architect   . It would be instructive to compare two microwave instruments   : one \nsynthetic aperture (SMOS   ) and the other real aperture (CMIS   ) (Figure  8.23  below).  \n\n CMIS, weighing 348 kg, was  fl own on the NASA Coriolis    satellite. This instru-\nment provided microwave radiation measurements in 77 channels between 6 GHz \nand 183 GHz. Its con fi guration    was very similar to the MADRAS instrument \ndescribed in Section  8.3.4 , but it had a much larger antenna aperture of 2.2 m. As in \nMADRAS, conical scanning    around the Nadir    direction provided the swath. SMOS \nwas launched in 2009 by ESA. It is being used to derive soil moisture and sea-surface \nsalinity by performing microwave radiometry in a single band at 1.4 GHz. The syn-\nthetic aperture technique employed by SMOS permits an instrument with a 4 m \naperture, which can perform electronic scanning with no mechanisms    or physical \nmovements, but it is able to provide observations only at one frequency.  \n\n    8.6.4.   Resolution versus altitude \n\n The spatial resolution    of an image is one of its fundamental quality parameters. There \nare two possible situations:\n\n   The observable is located far away in deep space    and its distance is independent \u2022 \nof the orbit. In these cases good spatial resolution    is only possible by means of \nlarge apertures and, sophisticated detector arrays    in the instrument\u2019s focal plane   .  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n222 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  The observable is located on the celestial body being orbited. In this case reducing \u2022 \nthe orbit altitude    will increase the spatial resolution    of the image.    \n\n The same instrument  fl ying at lower altitude will increase resolution, but the instru-\nment\u2019s swath will be proportionally reduced. However, in applications focusing on \nnondynamic observables    having a large swath    will not be a signi fi cant design factor. \nNevertheless, there are limits in this approach because the atmospheric drag    associated \nto low altitudes will perturb the satellite orbit. The atmosphere becomes denser at lower \naltitudes and low orbits are impractical, as they require complex orbit control    systems. \nThe GOCE    mission (Section   10.3.1    ) uses electrical propulsion    to maintain an orbit alti-\ntude    of just 250 km. The mission concept is de fi ned by the need to  fl y this low, and the \nprice to be paid is a high one. Flying below 400 km becomes progressively less practical. \nMilitary satellites use low Earth    orbits in order to gain the maximum possible spatial \nresolution   . The American military satellite KH-11 had an apogee    of some 443 km and a \nperigee    as low as 300 km. 10  Only a small portion of the Earth coincides with the perigee, \nand the opportunities for acquiring images at such a low altitude were infrequent. This \nscheme cannot be used to observe targets that require frequent revisits and ample \ncoverage.   \n\n   10   Jane\u2019s Space Systems and Industry 2007-2008.

Allocation of budgets    \n\n In the previous sections of the present chapter the following requirements   , which are \nassociated with budgets   , have been mentioned:\n\n   Radiometric quality and MTF    in Section  \u2022 8.4.2   \n  Data quantity in Section  \u2022 8.4.4   \n  Data delivery and latency    in Section  \u2022 8.4.6     \n\n The problems associated with the implementation of large data throughput    will be \none of the main topics of Chapter   12    . Chapter   11     (Section 11.5.3) and Chapter   12     \n(Sections   12.4.2     and   12.5.3    ) will analyze in detail data delivery and data latency    \nissues. The two remaining budgets    \u2013 MTF    and radiometric quality    \u2013 will be intro-\nduced in Sections  8.7.1  and  8.7.2 . Section  8.7.3  will provide supplementary informa-\ntion on the budget resulting from the end-to-end data quality requirement. The \nful fi llment of the instrument data quality budget will be just a part of the larger end-\nto-end budget. Section  8.7.3  will expand on the analysis provided in Section  8.5  on \nradar altimetry    end-to-end performance calculations. \n\n    8.7.1.   Radiometric quality \n\n Radiometric quality is associated with the instrument signal-to-noise budget. To \nincrease the signal it is necessary to provide a con fi guration    (Chapter   10    ) that will \nallow accommodating a large instrument aperture size. To reduce the noise, it is nec-\nessary to have good detector technologies and a suf fi cient cooling    of the detectors. \nCooling alternatives will be discussed in Section   10.5.4    . To increase the time allo-\ncated for the signal to be integrated will also improve the signal-to-noise ratio. \nNevertheless, during the time allocated for signal integration it will be necessary to \nkeep a stable line of sight   . This will derive requirements    on attitude control    (Section \n  9.8    ). To allow longer integration times will also reduce the amount of data produced \nby the mission. This means, the ful fi llment of the instrument\u2019s signal-to-noise ratio \nbudget generates a cascade of design alternatives and of derived sub-budgets    that \nneed mutual balancing.  \n\n    8.7.2.   MTF    \n\n MTF    has been de fi ned in Section  8.4.2  as the capability of the instrument to properly \nreproduce contrast at increasingly  fi ne spatial resolutions. The speci fi ed MTF value \nshall be allocated between the following sources:\n\n   The MTF    that is allocated to the instrument itself. These errors include the \u2022 \ndetectors, aperture, diffraction limit,    and telescope    dimensional accuracy \nerrors.  \n  MTF    associated to the perturbations of the instrument\u2019s line of sight    during the \u2022 \nintegration time    necessary to detect the signal. These perturbations will have a \nslow, low-frequency component \u201cdrift   \u201d and a fast, high-frequency \u201cjitter   \u201d compo-\nnent. Instrument line of sight and satellite attitude    perturbations and accuracies \nwill be studied in detail in Section   9.8.2    .    \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n224 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n The handling of the MTF    budget associated with the instrument will be in the \nhands of the instrument specialist. The handling of the MTF budget associated with \nthe line of sight    perturbations will be the responsibility of the attitude control    stability \nspecialist. The architect    shall keep a balance between them.  \n\n    8.7.3.   The end-to-end performance \n\n Section  8.5  described end-to-end mission performance simulation and examined \nradar altimetry    in some detail. We saw that appraising overall mission performance    \nfrom a top-down    perspective    offered opportunities for optimizing the mission\u2019s \ndesign. Sentinel-3   \u2019s mandate was to recover sea-surface height with an error on the \norder of 3\u20135 cm. The availability of an end-to-end performance simulation for \nSentinel-3 allowed the creation of what-if scenarios in which the error allocated to \neach individual error source    could be increased or decreased. This permitted alterna-\ntive mission architectures to be examined, with different designs for and different \nallocations to all the contributors to the mission\u2019s overall performance. The goal was \nto achieve a mission design in which the budget was effectively apportioned, so that \nthe most dif fi cult design features had proportionally larger error allocations, thus \nreducing the mission\u2019s overall dif fi culty. In Sentinel-3\u2019s case, the end-to-end simula-\ntion    was also used to study greatly simpli fi ed radar altimeter    options, including a \ndesign featuring one single-frequency radar which increased the ionospheric error \ncontribution and another design without a microwave radiometer, which increased the \nerrors caused by the echoes passing through a wet troposphere. The results of the \nanalysis advised keeping both design features because their elimination led to unac-\nceptable error levels. The  fi nal budget allocation    was as follows (Table  8.1 ).  \n\n The addition rules for errors have been introduced in Section   5.5.4    . In the case \npresented in the table above, the different error sources are uncorrelated; the worst \ncase of ionosphere perturbation will not coincide with the worst case of troposphere \nwater vapor content. Therefore, the total sum of the error sources would be a root \nmean square    addition of the individual contributions. The outcomes show that the \n fi nal performance would be driven by the larger contributors, and a moderate relax-\nation of requirements with respect to the middle and lower contributors would not \n\n   Table 8.1.

For example, the acceptable altim-\neter random error    would be allocated to all the internal instrument factors that con-\ntribute to the correct functioning of the radar altimeter   . Decisions related to this \nsecond level of apportionment are internal to the instrument, and fall within the \ndomain of the instrument specialists. The architect   \u2019s responsibility is to ensure that \nthe ful fi llment of the value originally apportioned to this particular error source    is in \nfact adequate for the design of the instrument and in line with the cost    and risk    guide-\nlines provided by the sponsor   . If the original error allocation    pushes the concept \nbeyond the cost and risk guidelines, it will be necessary to improve and re fi ne the \ndesign, as well as to allocate a larger portion of the overall error budget    to that par-\nticular error source. This requires ascertaining whether any other lines in the error \nbudget can be tightened. This process must be repeated until the design\u2019s level of \ndif fi culty and resulting performances are balanced. This will then de fi ne the optimal \nerror allocation levels. If the requested end-to-end performance is too demanding, this \nequilibrium can be impossible to reach, and various design components would appear \nas incompatible with the cost or risk guidelines. In that case, it would be necessary to \nrequest a reduction of mission ambitions from the consumer   , or for more money and \ndevelopment time from the mission sponsor. The availability of the end-to-end simu-\nlation will allow for properly justifying any request for reduction of the mission\u2019s \nambitions.         \n\n\n\n227M.A. Aguirre, Introduction to Space Systems: Design and Synthesis, Space Technology Library 27, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9, \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n    Keywords   Satellite Orbit Design,    Satellite Attitude Design,   Space Environment,  \n Satellite Orbit Types,   Satellite Attitude Types,   Space Mission Phases,   Satellite \nPointing Perturbations,   Satellite Pointing Control,   Coverage,   Revisit,   Geo-Location,  \n Co-Registration,   Satellite Agility    \n\n This    domain was introduced in Section   7.1.2    .

It orbits \nEarth at an altitude of 800 km with an inclination of 98.65\u00b0.

Section  9.7  studies the geometry and visibility of the observed bodies \u2013 Sun   , \nEarth   , the observable   , or deep space    \u2013 located on the celestial sphere    around the satel-\nlite and how this geometry is different for different orbits and attitudes. The next \nsection (Section  9.8 ) introduces pointing    and perturbations to pointing   . The next two \nsections \u2013 as in all the chapters of this part of the book \u2013 analyze design decisions \nrelated to the allocation of functions    and to the numerical allocation of budgets   . The \nlast Section ( 9.11 ) deals with the implementation and maintenance of constellations   . \n\n As indicated in Section   7.1    , the determination of the satellite\u2019s attitude and orbit \nare the  fi rst design decisions directly governed by the requirements    of the observables    \nand instruments   . The interactions involved in the orbit and attitude design indicated \nin Figure   7.1     are recalled and depicted in detail in Figure  9.1  below. This domain is \nrich in interrelations. It interfaces with: \n\n   The instruments   , because attitude and orbit de fi ne the observables   \u2019 conditions of \u2022 \nvisibility  \n  The launcher   , because the launcher carries the satellite to the selected orbit  \u2022 \n  The satellite con fi guration    \u2013 location of the antennae, solar arrays,    and heat radia-\u2022 \ntors   , location of the instruments \u2013    because the attitude and the orbit de fi ne the \nvisibility of the satellite  \n  The satellite operations    and instrument data downlink    architectures, because the \u2022 \norbital geometry de fi nes the pattern of contact    with ground stations       \n\n As Figure  9.1  demonstrates, the interrelations of the orbit and attitude are espe-\ncially complex. In order to de fi ne these interrelations correctly a good architectural \noverview    is needed to derive the best system concept. Within this domain, there are \ntwo areas of special dif fi culty and that require detailed and long discussion:\n\n   What is the geometry and visibility around the satellite   ? This will be analyzed in \u2022 \nSection  9.7 . Section   10.4     will discuss how the con fi guration    of the satellite deals \nwith the drivers generated by this geometry.  \n  Pointing as an end-to-end    issue. This is analyzed in Section  \u2022 9.8 .    \n\n The above-mentioned complexities justify the length of this chapter, which is the \nlongest of the book. \n\n  Figure 9.1.

Elements and components involved in the domain \n\n This section will look at the elements and components included in this domain. It is \ndivided into three subsections according to the functions to be performed:\n\n   Launchers     \u2022 \n  Orbit determination    and control tools  \u2022 \n  Attitude determination    and control tools    \u2022 \n\n    9.1.1.   Launchers    \n\n The launcher    is not designed for a speci fi c mission but selected from available exist-\ning designs and as such forms part of a mission\u2019s design constraints. In commercial \nprojects the architect    may freely select the optimal launcher. In noncommercial proj-\nects the launcher must often be selected from a number of politically preferred alter-\nnatives provided by the sponsor    to the architect. \n\n The launcher   \u2019s owner establishes the launcher\u2019s rules of use in formal documents. \nThe mission architect    can thus disregard the internal details of the launcher apart from \nits payload interfaces, and depend mainly on the information contained in the formal \nlauncher documentation, typically referred to as the \u201cLauncher User\u2019s Manual\u201d or \n\u201cLauncher User\u2019s Guide.   \u201d For this reason, in the place of a description of the compo-\nnents and technologies involved in the highly specialized domain of launcher design, \nwhich is outside the aims of this book, this section will provide an overview of \nlauncher functions and how launchers and launching sites shape satellite design and \nthe choice of orbit. \n\n Launchers    lift the satellites from Earth    and put them into orbit. While the launcher    \ntravels through the atmosphere, the satellite remains enclosed within a protective \nlauncher fairing    that isolates it from direct aerodynamic forces    and heating   . Once \noutside the atmosphere the fairing is jettisoned. During every phase of the launch the \nlauncher provides mechanical and electrical interfaces with the satellite. The mechan-\nical interface secures the satellite during launch while the electrical interface provides \nelectrical power. Some launchers are able to provide multiple  fi ring of their rocket \nengines   , which allows orbital corrections    or the launching of several satellites into \nmoderately different orbits. Some launchers also feature provisions for the simultane-\nous accommodation of two or three medium-sized satellites or a larger number of \nsmaller satellites. \n\n Once the injection orbit has been reached, the launcher    severs its physical connec-\ntion to the satellite and ejects it. Any asymmetry in the ejection forces imparted by \nthe launcher will produce a satellite rotating speed. This speed should be as slow as \npossible so that the satellite can rapidly acquire a safe attitude    and establish commu-\nnications with the satellite control center    on the ground. \n\n Launchers    always introduce some errors into the satellite\u2019s intended trajectory \nduring injection. The launcher    documentation should indicate the worst-case values \nof these errors. The injection errors    will determine the amount of fuel to be carried \nby the satellite for orbital-error injection corrections   . \n\n The launch site    provides the necessary services for the launch. The launcher    \nrequires supplementary services for fuelling, assembly, and launch control   . The satel-\nlite requires  fi nal checkout, fueling, and attachment to the launcher. \n\n\n\n230 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n The  fi rst decisions are which launcher    and which launch site    are to be employed. \nAs said above, the launcher is usually selected from a limited range of possibilities. \nThe launcher must be as cheap as possible, but also reliable, and obviously must \nprovide performance speci fi cations    compatible with the mission\u2019s needs. It also needs \nto be decided whether the launch will be dedicated or shared. A dedicated launch    \nprovides optimal orbital injection as well as a freer choice of launch date, but must \nbear the overall cost    of the launch. Shared launches    reduce costs but entail reaching \na compromise on the launch date and launch orbit between the missions sharing the \nlauncher. \n\n Placing constellations in orbit usually requires launching many satellites at once, \nand it may be necessary to provide special structural interfaces between the various \nsatellites and the launcher   . An agreement with the launcher authority on a strategy for \nejecting the satellites according to prearranged trajectories and established time \ndelays is crucial for avoiding the risk    of mutual collisions. \n\n The choice of launcher    imposes requirements    on the satellite. If more than one \nlauncher is to be used, the requirements imposed on the satellite will be derived from \nthe worst-case values speci fi ed by all the launchers. \n\n The launch site    de fi nes what services it will provide for the satellite\u2019s  fi nal \nveri fi cation and its installation inside the launcher   . The launch site authority can also \nidentify duration times for these activities, which will be included as part of the mis-\nsion\u2019s schedule   . A further constraint    arises because not all launch sites are suitable \nfor all orbits; for orbital injection into the equatorial plane    \u2013 as is the case with geo-\nstationary communication satellites    \u2013 a launch site near the equator    will maximize the \nadded rotational speed of the Earth    to the energy provided by the launcher, hence a \nlaunch from near the Equator    is more ef fi cient. \n\n Launcher stages are discarded as they are used, and there is a risk    of debris    falling \nover inhabited areas; this limits the azimuths that can be used from each launch site   . \nAll these orbital limitations are included in the launcher\u2019s documentation   . In some \ncases there is a limited period for which the launch site may be used each year. \n\n Normally a long time elapses between the design of the mission architecture and \nof fi cial approval of the contract by the launcher    authority. To avoid unforeseen issues \nregarding launcher choice, it is advisable to make the satellite compatible with more \nthan one launcher, in case the  fi rst choice increases in price or its availability becomes \nproblematic.  \n\n    9.1.2.   Orbit determination and correction \n\n Satellite orbits    frequently require correcting. Orbital corrections are of two types:\n\n   Orbital change   , which implies a relatively powerful, long thrust    to shift the satel-\u2022 \nlite path from one orbit to another  \n  Orbital control   , which is a short and careful push to control the path of the satellite \u2022 \nwhen it drifts from its nominal one    \n\n Several situations require proportionally large orbital changes   :\n\n   To compensate for injection errors    introduced by the launcher   ; may require large \u2022 \ninitial orbit corrections.  \n\n\n\n231The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n  When the satellite is released into an orbit that is not the  fi nal one. For example, \u2022 \nmany communication satellites    are injected by their launchers into a highly eccen-\ntric orbit, and then move into the required circular geostationary orbit    using their \nown on-board propulsion   .  \n  In cases \u2013 such as interplanetary missions \u2013 that call for several major orbital \u2022 \nchanges    in order to follow the complex trajectory required by their missions. This \ncan be accomplished using the on-board propulsion    subsystem   , though careful \nrendezvous    with planets    can also provide large orbital changes.  \n  Collision avoidance    maneuvers; these may arise, particularly in low Earth    orbit    \u2022 \nmissions, due to the ever-increasing number of objects in orbit around the Earth \nor. In effect they amount to two small orbit changes for each maneuver cycle, the \n fi rst to avoid the object that risks colliding with the satellite, and the second to \nrecover the original trajectory.  \n  Deorbiting    is also an increasingly frequent requirement aimed at clearing space \u2022 \nfrom satellites that have already performed their functions and have become \nspace junk   , which represents a danger to future space missions. Low Earth    orbit \nsatellites must reduce their altitude, so that atmospheric drag    will ensure reen-\ntry    and burning of the satellite in the atmosphere. Satellites in geostationary \norbit    must also place themselves in \u201cgraveyard orbits   \u201d at the end of their opera-\ntional lives   .    \n\n External perturbations affect the nominal orbit of all satellites, and their trajecto-\nries will drift    with respect to the nominal ones. These external perturbations include: \natmospheric drag   ; the higher-order values of Earth\u2019s gravitational potential   ; and the \ngravitational pull of the Sun   , Moon,    and the other planets    in the solar system   . To cor-\nrect this drift the satellite must have its own propulsion    subsystem    capable of deliver-\ning careful and controlled amounts of thrust    that shall be provided in the most \nfuel-ef fi cient manner to avoid drift away from the nominal orbit by more than is \nallowed by mission requirements   . On the other hand, external forces can also be \nemployed to perform useful orbital changes   ; for example, the Sun-synchronous    orbit    \n(Section  9.4.2 ) uses the nonspherical values of Earth\u2019s gravitational potential    to pro-\nvide a natural change of the orbital plane    with the required speed. \n\n To be able to perform any orbital change   , it is  fi rst necessary to determine the orbit \nit is following. The ground segment     fl ight operations    team traditionally performs \norbit determination   , but lately low Earth orbit    satellites can perform the task autono-\nmously by using receivers that detect signals from navigation satellites such as GPS    \nor Galileo   . \n\n To be capable of producing an orbital change    the satellite must expel fuel at high \nspeed. The energy source for providing the necessary speed depends on the nature of \nthe satellite\u2019s on-board propulsion    system, which can take the following forms:\n\n   A pressurized inert gas will be ejected at a speed which is a function of the storage \u2022 \npressure.  \n  A monopropellant    such as hydrazine    will decompose in the presence of a catalyst, \u2022 \nand the chemical reaction will generate energy which increases the speed of \nejection.  \n  Two chemical substances, an oxidizer and a fuel will react with each other and the \u2022 \nenergy produced will increase the temperature and kinetic energy of the ejected mix.  \n\n\n\n232 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  In ion-thrusters    the propellant is ionized and accelerated in an electrical  fi eld. In \u2022 \nthis case, the acceleration energy is provided by the electrical power components \nof the satellite.    \n\n Pressurized inert gas    systems include a tank    for storage of the gas, pipes and \n fi lters, valves to regulate the  fl ow of the gas, and nozzles to allow the pressurized gas \nto be expelled, providing thrust   . Pressurized inert gas is easy and cheap to implement, \nbut the energy generated solely by the expanding gas will provide only a small \namount of impulse per unit of fuel mass. Pressurized inert gas is adequate for mis-\nsions requiring orbit control   , but is insuf fi cient for those demanding large orbital \ncorrections   . The propellant used by these systems is inert and not dangerous. This \nmakes them easy to handle on the ground during satellite manufacturing, assembly, \nand testing. Due to its small size and ease of use, pressurized inert gas is a common \nchoice for small missions   . \n\n Monopropellant systems use the same components as pressurized inert gas does, \nbut monopropellants    require the addition a catalyst, which produces the chemical \nbreakdown of the fuel. Monopropellants like hydrogen peroxide or hydrazine    decom-\npose and generate high amounts of heat, and the resulting ejection speed of the pro-\npellant is high. Monopropellant technology is well established and is used extensively, \nbut the fuels are highly volatile, toxic, and hazardous, requiring special on-ground \nstorage and handling procedures and facilities. \n\n In bipropellant    propulsion    subsystems the oxidizer and the fuel are stored in dif-\nferent containers and are mixed in a combustion chamber. The chemical reaction \nincreases the temperature of the combustion products, which are expelled at high \nspeed through a nozzle. In the case of liquid bipropellant systems, the components are \nsimilar to the components necessary for monopropellants   , but different tanks   , valves, \n fi lters, and pipes are required for the handling of the oxidizer and the fuel. The chemi-\ncal reaction produced by liquid bipropellants is more energetic than that generated by \nthe exothermic decomposition of monopropellants. Bipropellant systems can be used \nto advantage for high-impulse thrust   , as demanded by major orbital changes   , or for \nmoderate thrusts, as required by orbit control    or small orbital changes, but they are \nmore complex and expensive than monopropellants. Again, there are special on-\nground fuel-handling procedures and facilities required for the use of bipropellants. \n\n As in the previous cases, electric propulsion    requires containers for the storage of \nthe gas to be ejected, pipes, and valves, but it also requires the ion thruster itself. In \nthrusters    of this kind, the gas is ionized, accelerated, ejected, and electrically neutral-\nized. Electric propulsion also requires all the electrical components necessary for the \nacceleration of the ions, including high-power    high-voltage    electronics, control elec-\ntronics, and the supplementary solar array    and electric power    production hardware for \nproviding the energy needed for accelerating the ions. The mass and volume associ-\nated with electric power production, conditioning, and control are large and could \nreduce a large part of the mass advantages associated with the higher ejection speed \nof the propellant. These thrusters are suitable for providing small, continuous thrusts \nover long periods of time. \n\n Swing-by    is a maneuver in which a satellite performs a rendezvous    with a planet \nen-route to its  fi nal destination. The satellite approaches the planet,  fl ies near to it, and \nthen soars away, its trajectory now changed with respect to its initial one. This is a \n\n\n\n233The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\nspecialized method of orbital change    using external perturbations that are used exten-\nsively in interplanetary missions. Swing-by changes a satellite\u2019s orbit by  transferring \nmomentum from the planet to the satellite, and allows the performance of large \norbital changes    with zero fuel. The use of this method is by no means cost   -free, \nbecause it increases the length of the mission and involves complex operations, but it \nmay frequently be the only practical way to accomplish the proposed trajectory. \n\n Orbit determination    has traditionally been performed using range-ranging    in the \nground-to-satellite communications link. This link includes a well-de fi ned frequency \ntone sent to the satellite, which is then returned by the satellite to the ground station. \nThe returned signal frequency will change as a function of the speed between the \nsatellite and the ground station from which the actual orbit of the satellite can be \nderived. Recently, in-orbit GPS    navigation receivers carried by satellites in low Earth \norbit    are able to autonomously determine the position and derive the orbit of the satel-\nlite. It is also perfectly possible to use both tools at the same time. \n\n The establishment of the orbit and the overall propulsion    architecture is simul-\ntaneous because the establishment of one entails the establishment of the other. \nThis double decision is taken very early in the project and has a heavy impact on \nnearly all key mission parameters: the instruments   , mission life    and mission costs    \nand risks   . \n\n The selected orbit and the mission needs will establish the orbital change    and \norbital control    required, including parameters such as: the use or not of orbit correc-\ntion   ; the use of swing-by    or powerful on-board propulsion   ; the use of a single propul-\nsion system, or one system for large orbital correction maneuvers and another for \n fi ner orbital maintenance. The choice of the orbit correction architecture also shapes \nthe establishment of an overall mission time-line; if, for example, the orbit requires \nswing-by the mission will last longer than if it includes a powerful upper stage. \n\n Once the fundamental architecture has been established, the next step will be to \ndecide the nature of the orbit correction    subsystem   : monopropellant    versus bipropel-\nlant   ; and all the other detailed design decisions, i.e., the number and location of tanks   , \nvalves,  fi lters, thrusters,    and pipes. It is crucial to establish an orbit correction con-\ncept, and to determine how often orbit correction will be needed. Another important \npoint to consider is how orbit correction maneuvers will affect the mission operations    \nand the satellite\u2019s observational availability   ; satellites are frequently unable to ful fi ll \ntheir observing functions while performing maneuvers. The orbit control    subsystem \ncan also used to control the satellite attitude    in special circumstances like the safe \nmode    (Section  9.5 ) or when it is necessary to change the attitude for major orbital \nchanges   . The requirements    derived from this need shall also be taken into account. \n\n The design of rocket engines   , either for large launcher    engines or for small satellite \nthrusters   , is highly specialized and rather disconnected from the other space engineer-\ning disciplines. The propulsion    components of a satellite are almost never designed \nspeci fi cally for the mission but selected from within a range of already available \ncomponents that appear suitable to ful fi ll the mission\u2019s needs. From this point of view \nthe propulsion engineer plays a relatively small role on the overall process of archi-\ntectural de fi nition. On the other hand, the simultaneous decision regarding the orbit \nand the architecture of orbital control    is a fundamental one, to be taken early in the \nproject and having major impact throughout the mission design; this means it is a \n\n\n\n234 Introduction to Space Systems\n\ndecision in which the mission architect    plays the leading role. The architect shall also \nbe active in identifying the implications for the mission of design decisions, such as \nthe reduction of instrument availability    during orbit corrections, or the choice \nbetween satellite autonomy    and ground intervention    for orbit determination    and con-\ntrol, to be discussed in Chapter   11     as part of satellite operations   . It is also necessary \nto take into account the impact of the orbit correction    subsystem    concept on:\n\n   Center of masses    position and center of masses position changes as the fuel is used \u2022 \nup along the mission. This will drive the design of the attitude control    subsystem    \nof the satellite.  \n  The thruster axis location and possible plume impingement on satellite compo-\u2022 \nnents sensitive to contamination.     \n\n    9.1.3.   Attitude determination and control \n\n Attitude control includes determining the control approach to be used and the associ-\nated attitude control    modes. Selection of the control approach includes identifying the \nappropriate attitude sensors   , actuators, perturbation torques,    and the control logic to \nbe used. \n\n There are  fi ve possible attitude control    approaches: uncontrolled; gravity   -gradient   ; \nspin-stabilized   ; dual spin   /momentum bias   ; and inertial control   . These approaches will \nbe described in detail in Section  9.3 . \n\n The satellite\u2019s attitude can be determined by locating it with respect to familiar \nobjects such as the Sun   , the Earth\u2019s limb   , the Earth\u2019s magnetic  fi eld   , or stars. Sun \nsensors    determine the satellite\u2019s attitude by detecting the direction of solar radiation; \nthey are crude, but simple and reliable. Earth limb sensors detect the temperature \nchange between the Earth\u2019s limb, and the chill of deep space   . They are of intermedi-\nate accuracy and complexity but have the advantage that the satellite\u2019s instruments    \nare frequently targeted in the direction of Earth as well. \n\n Magnetometers    measure the Earth\u2019s    magnetic  fi eld vector, and derive attitude by \ncomparing their measurements with a map of the  fi eld. They possess low accuracy \nbut are robust and reliable. Star trackers are small telescopes that detect the direction \nof well-characterized stars with great accuracy, providing an absolute reference of the \nsatellite\u2019s attitude in inertial space   . Two star trackers   , viewing in two different direc-\ntions, are needed to provide a three-axes attitude reference for the satellite. Modern \nstar trackers can also recognize the satellite\u2019s attitude in a \u201clost in space\u201d situation, \nand are able to derive angular speed by measuring the changes in the position of the \nstars over time. Gyroscopes    of various kinds are also able to measure the satellite\u2019s \nangular velocity   . They complement the attitude sensors   , which determine the angular \nposition   , providing more robust and accurate control logic. \n\n The satellite\u2019s attitude control logic    depends on various factors, including the \nattitude control concept, the sensors, the actuators and attitude accuracy and agility    \nrequirements. In the past, the control loop was implemented using \u201chard-wired\u201d ana-\nlog control logic, but these days it is digital and is implemented in either the satellite\u2019s \ncentral computer or in a dedicated one. The digital control always includes feedback    \nloops, but may also feature feed-forward    ones to assist in attitude control by permit-\nting the satellite to initiate control from a well-placed initial point. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n235The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n The actuators are able to provide torques    for changing the satellite\u2019s attitude. \nGravity-gradient booms    are deployable structures    with a mass at the tip which \n generate a gravitationally induced torque for the satellite to align itself with the local \nvertical or gravity    vector   ; as soon as the boom strays from the local vertical, the dif-\nferential pull of the gravity acting in different parts of the satellite will attempt to \nalign the boom with the gravitational  fi eld    direction, thus providing a reference atti-\ntude for the satellite. If the satellite oscillates, passive dampers dissipate the energy \nproduced. They contain  fl uids that are forced to interact with balls or holes when the \nsatellite oscillates, dissipating the energy associated with the movement, and eventu-\nally causing it to stop. The inertia properties of the satellite are driven by its shape \nand mass distribution and the resulting inertia ratios can provide inherent gravita-\ntional torques that act as nondeploying gravity-gradient    booms. A magneto-torque    is \na current loop that interacts with the Earth   \u2019s    magnetic  fi eld, introducing a torque into \nthe satellite. Regulating the current in the loop can regulate the strength    of the torque. \nThe torque is produced by the interaction between the current loop and the Earth\u2019s \nmagnetic  fi eld and is always orthogonal to the plane formed by the magnetic dipole \nvector of the control loop and the Earth magnetic  fi eld vector at the satellite position. \nNevertheless, using several magneto-torques    it is possible to provide torques around \ndifferent axes. Although they are relatively simple and can be accurate, and are able \nto operate for long periods, the instantaneous torque that they provide is of only mod-\nerate strength. Momentum wheels    consist of an inertia wheel, an electric motor, bear-\nings, and control electronics   . The control electronics can direct the motor to accelerate \nor decelerate the inertia wheel\u2019s rotation speed. Any change in the wheel\u2019s speed will \nproduce a torque on the rest of the satellite. Momentum wheels are  fl exible tools \nproviding small or large torques with notable accuracy; they are limited, however, by \na maximum allowable speed, and must be unloaded \u2013 that is their speed must be \nreduced \u2013 by external torques to prevent them from reaching their maximum allow-\nable speeds. To provide torques in all directions, at least three wheels are needed. \nA fourth one is usually provided for redundancy. Control momentum gyros    are \nmomentum wheels    whose rotation axis    can be changed. Changing the rotation axis of \na momentum wheel rotating at high speed will introduce strong torques on the rest of \nthe satellite, allowing fast variations in its attitude. Control momentum gyros are \nexpensive, high performance items with complex control electronics, but they pro-\nvide highly accurate, highest-strength attitude actuation. The  fi ring of thrusters    whose \nline of action does not pass through the satellite\u2019s center of mass will also produce \ntorque. Thrusters    can be used for large or small attitude changes, as well as for \nunloading momentum wheels. \n\n A number of satellites requiring the utmost accuracy use the instruments    them-\nselves as supplementary attitude sensors   . GOCE    (Section   10.3.1    ) uses its gravity-\nsensing    accelerometers    to derive the satellite\u2019s angular accelerations   . Astronomical \ntelescopes use the images acquired by the telescope    itself as a supplementary, \nextremely high-accuracy star tracker   . \n\n The  fi rst fundamental design decision is the choice between a fully active control \nconcept and the use of some additional passive control component, such as the \ngravity-gradient    boom or the spinning of the satellite. Section   7.1.3     compared the \ncon fi guration    of the three-axis stabilized    GOESS    with the spin-stabilized    MSG   . \nThe choice of one or the other type of attitude will have a major impact on the satellite \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n236 Introduction to Space Systems\n\ncon fi guration and on the entire mission design. The choice is in fl uenced by many \ncomplex factors, among them previous experience with the alternative approaches; \ninstrument requirements   ; attitude control    requirements; cost    and risk   . Once the \n decision has been made, the selection of sensors, control logic, and actuators for the \ndifferent control modes must be undertaken. It is especially important to design a \nstrategy for the satellite\u2019s initial attitude acquisition after its ejection by the \nlauncher   . \n\n The attitude control bandwidth   , which determines the frequency at which the con-\ntrol authority starts to decrease, is very important. The pointing    error is inversely \nproportional to the bandwidth, and an accurate pointing system requires a large band-\nwidth. Ideally the attitude control loop will require that the satellite behaves as a rigid \nsolid within its control bandwidth and that any large  fl exible deployable structures    \nshould have their natural frequencies    outside the control bandwidth. Nevertheless, \nthis will not always be possible; some satellites require high pointing accuracy    and \ncarry large low-stiffness    deployables   ; JWST    (Section   8.3.2    ) is an example of this. \nMission design will call for specifying not only the satellite\u2019s pointing accuracy but \nalso its pointing stability    and accuracy in the recovery of both parameters. \n\n For agile satellites   , the speed of repointing    is crucial; this requires the use of very \nlarge momentum wheels   , control momentum gyro   s, or powerful thrusters    to provide \nthe necessary large torques   . In other cases, the mission will call for slow and continu-\nous attitude changes; momentum wheels are ideal for providing well-controlled \ncontinuous torques around any axis by ordering changes in their rotation speeds. \nMomentum wheels are the most  fl exible and widely used attitude actuators; they are \nable to provide either moderately small or large torques as needed during either short \nor moderately long periods of time. \n\n Attitude control is highly specialized discipline with well-developed analytical \ntools to derive the satellite behavior when confronted with its varying environment. \nThese tools are simulations of the dynamic environments of the satellite and of the \nreaction to them of the attitude control    components. The models shall be able to rep-\nresent the changing environment with the necessary level of accuracy. Attitude con-\ntrol is central to the overall satellite design and will drive many of the design decisions \nto be taken by other engineering disciplines. This duality of high specialization but \nstrong in fl uence upon the overall design process    produces a situation where the atti-\ntude control is often designed by the same entity that is responsible for the delivery \nof the whole satellite. The attitude control sensors and actuators are selected from \nalready available models, provided by specialized suppliers. \n\n The architect    takes a leading role in balancing the impacts of the attitude control    \ndesign on the mission as a whole. The relationship of the attitude control system with \nthe satellite\u2019s instruments    and modes of operation are especially important. \n\n In the case of high-accuracy pointing    it is important to control the micro-perturba-\ntions    generated by the satellite, including those generated by the attitude control    \nactuators. It is necessary to establish and administer a micro-perturbation budget    to \nbe allocated between all possible sources. Pointing budgets    are another factor in \nwhich the attitude control interacts with other subsystems such as the structure    or \nthermal control    and the attitude control could be relaxed as long as the dimensional \nstability    was tightened. The need to allocate con fl icting requirements    between differ-\nent engineering domains is another area where the architect   \u2019s lead is crucial.   \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n237The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n    9.2.   The space environment as orbit and attitude design driver \n\n The present section will describe the space environment    in general and will analyze \nhow the external environment    drives the satellite\u2019s orbit and attitude design. Section   10.2    , \nwhich complements the present discussion, will analyze the space environment    as a \ncon fi guration    driver. The space environment is described in specialized literature \nsuch as ECSS   -E-10-04A. 1  The following description makes extensive use of this \nreference; for a more comprehensive description of the space environment please \nrefer to the text cited. There is a book speci fi cally dedicated to the Space Environment: \n The Space Environment and Its Effects on Space Systems  from Vincet Pisacane, \nAIAA Education Series 2008. This section analyzes mainly the space environment \naround the Earth   , which is still today the environment for most space missions. \nSatellites  fl ying beyond Earth orbit to other planets    and near-Earth objects are \nspeci fi cally designed to withstand these interplanetary environments. This topic is \nintroduced in Section  9.2.6 . \n\n    9.2.1.   Gravity  fi eld \n\n Satellites move around the gravity     fi eld of a central body   . As a provisional approxi-\nmation, the central body can be considered as perfectly spherical and uniform. In this \ncase, the satellite will adhere to Newtonian laws   , and its orbit will trace a hyperbola   , \nparabola,    or ellipse   , with the central body at one of its foci   . In reality the central \nbody\u2019s mass distribution is never uniform and the orbit around it must be correspond-\ningly modi fi ed with respect to the ideal. Whatever the shape of the central body the \ngravity  fi eld will be a potential  fi eld   , ful fi lling Laplace\u2019s equations   , and can be \ndescribed in terms of a central force augmented by a series of spherical harmonics    \nexpressed by Legendre functions    of two parameters: degree  n  and order  m . These \nspherical harmonics, which are a function of the mass distribution of the body being \norbited, can be determined by analyzing the trajectory of satellites. High-accuracy \nmodels such as JGM-2 2  provide harmonics up to degree and order 70. The GOCE    \n(Section   10.3.1    ) mission\u2019s aim is the high-accuracy determination of Earth   \u2019s    gravity \n fi eld that will provide harmonics up to degree and order 200 and more. \n\n Missions requiring highly accurate determinations of the satellite\u2019s position \nrequire the use of highly accurate models to determine their orbit, but most missions \nonly call for consideration of the few most important harmonics. The most important \nharmonic is J2   , which represents the 22 km of Earth   \u2019s polar  fl attening. J2\u2019s order of \nmagnitude is 0.0005 of the main Newtonian gravity    term. The perturbations gener-\nated by the J2 term can be used positively to provide controlled and useful changes \nto the orbit. The Sun-synchronous    (Section  9.4.2 ) and Molniya    (Section  9.4.3 ) orbits \nowe their existence to J2. The J3    term represents the fact that the Earth is not only \n fl attened but is slightly pear-shaped, with a polar bulge of 16.5 m. J3 is of the order \nof 10 ?6  of Newtonian gravity and is used to control \u201cfrozen orbits   \u201d (Section  9.4.2 ). \n\n   1   Space Environment, ECSS   -E-10-04 ECSS ESA.  \n   2   Gravity Model Development for TOPEX/POSEIDEN: Joint Gravity Models 1 and 2, Nerem R.S. et al., \nJ.

Vol. 99, December 1994.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n238 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nThe harmonic J22 represents the fact that the equatorial radius of the Earth is not \nuniform. J22 produces long period (800 days) east-west oscillations on satellites \nlocated in the geostationary position (Section  9.4.4 ). To control the position of the \nsatellite it will be necessary to perform orbit corrections. The gravity  fi eld is stronger \nwhen closer to the center of the planet and the resulting difference in gravitational \npull, the gravity-gradient   , acting upon the different parts of a satellite, will introduce \ntorques   , which will align the satellite in the direction of minimal energy, with its long \nside pointed along the vertical direction. In some satellite attitudes, this gravity-gradient \ntorque represents a perturbation to be compensated for; in other cases it will be of \nhelp because it provides a  fi xed attitude with respect to the central body   . \n\n The Earth\u2019s gravity     fi eld dominates orbits around the Earth; nevertheless the gravi-\ntational force of the Sun    and Moon    will disrupt the nominal path of the satellite, \nwhich must be compensated for in cases where careful control of the orbit is neces-\nsary for the ful fi llment of a mission\u2019s aims. Geostationary (Section  9.4.4 ) orbits are \nlocated in the plane de fi ned by the Earth\u2019s equator   ; the Sun and Moon will tend to \npull the satellite away from this plane. The design of geostationary orbits    requires the \nprovision of on-board propulsion    to compensate for these perturbations. As the satel-\nlite moves away from the Earth, its gravity  fi eld becomes weaker. The Lagrangian    \npoint    (Section  9.4.6 ) is located in the place where the Earth\u2019s and Sun\u2019s gravity  fi elds \nhave the same strength   .  \n\n    9.2.2.   Earth\u2019s magnetic  fi eld    \n\n The Earth    has a magnetic  fi eld that, like the gravity  fi eld   , is potential, and which can \nalso be described as a main dipole    term plus an expansion of progressively smaller \nterms. The Earth\u2019s dipole axis is tilted with respect to its rotation axis   , and changes \ndirection over time, with its strength    decaying. To cope with these variations there are \nseveral regularly updated reference  fi elds; the International Geomagnetic Reference \nField deserves special mention. 3  The Earth\u2019s magnetic  fi eld    does not affect a satel-\nlite\u2019s orbit, though it does affect its attitude by generating torques    that interact with \nthe electrical currents inside the satellite. The Earth\u2019s magnetic  fi eld can also be used \nas an attitude control    tool by generating currents on board, and as an attitude deter-\nmination    tool by measuring the magnetic  fi eld and deriving the satellite\u2019s attitude \nfrom it. If the Earth\u2019s magnetic  fi eld is to be used to determine and control a satellite\u2019s \nattitude, the satellite must carry on-board maps of the  fi eld. The magnetic  fi eld\u2019s \nhigher spherical harmonic terms will normally be of interest only to missions focus-\ning on the measurement of the  fi eld. These terms depend on magnetic features of the \nEarth\u2019s crust, mantle, and core, and their measurement can be used to study the \nEarth\u2019s geophysical properties. A precise description of the magnetic  fi eld as a func-\ntion of latitude, longitude, and radius is also crucial for analyzing the Earth\u2019s iono-\nsphere   , essential for deriving the satellite\u2019s radiation environment    (Section  9.2.5 ). \n\n The above description refers to the magnetic  fi eld generated by the solid Earth   ; \nnevertheless; there are external factors that also in fl uence the magnetic  fi eld around \n\n   3   International Geomagnetic Reference Field, the Third Generation, Peddie N. W., J. Geomag Geoelect 34, \n1982.  \n\n\n\n239The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\nthe satellite: the solar wind    will cause distortions of the  fi eld at high altitude. Electrical \ncurrents inside the ionosphere will also alter the magnetic  fi eld. At short distances \nfrom the Earth, the impacts of these magnetic  fi eld sources is small and do not nor-\nmally need to be taken into account. At greater distances from the Earth, the strength    \nof the main dipole term decreases and the external  fi elds become important. In the \ngeostationary position, for example, the Earth\u2019s magnetic  fi eld    has a strength of 100 \nnT, but is subject to an approximately 50% modulation from the diurnal cycle, and \ncan even become reversed in severe geomagnetic solar storms   .  \n\n    9.2.3.   Neutral atmosphere \n\n Aerodynamic drag generated by the remaining atmosphere still present at the satel-\nlite\u2019s orbit altitude    will disturb its path. This effect will affect the design of any satel-\nlite  fl ying below 1,000 km. Atmospheric drag    is a signi fi cant design factor for \naltitudes below 500 km and becomes the key design driver for satellites  fl ying below \n300 km. GOCE   , which  fl ies at an altitude of 260 km (Section   10.3.1    ), is an example \nof this. The aerodynamic forces    caused by the orbital velocity and high-altitude atmo-\nspheric winds will, unless corrected, produce changes in the satellite\u2019s orbital param-\neters. These forces call for compensation to avoid orbital decay   . Atmospheric drag, \non the other hand, can be used at the end of a mission to reduce the satellite\u2019s altitude \nin preparation for full atmospheric reentry and satellite self-destruction. This will \neliminate in-orbit debris    that would otherwise be a danger for other spacecraft. The \namount of atmospheric drag    strongly depends on both orbit altitude and solar activity   . \nAtmospheric density    decays exponentially with altitude. Atmospheric density can \nchange by up to two orders of magnitude between solar maximum    and minimum. \nFigure  9.2  provides an overview of atmospheric density    as a function of altitude for \ndifferent levels of solar activity, which increases and decreases along a solar activity \ncycle with a period of around 11 years.  \n\n1.E-06\n\n1.E-07\nM\n\nas\ns \n\nde\nns\n\nity\n (\n\nkg\n/m\n\n3 )\n\n1.E-08\n\n1.E-09\n\n1.E-10\n\n1.E-11\n\n1.E-12\n\n1.E-13\n\n1.E-14\n\n1.E-15\n50 250 450 650\n\nHigh activity\n\nMean activity\n\nLow activity\n\n850\nAltitude (km)\n\n  Figure 9.2.

ESA ECSS    4  recommends the use of MSISE   -90, 5  which is administered \nby NASA Goddard. MSISE provides altitude pro fi les of temperature, molecular and \natomic concentrations, total density, and molecular weight as a function of the \n\u201cF10.7   \u201d solar activity    index and of the Earth   \u2019s magnetic \u201cAp\u201d activity index. The \n10.7 index re fl ects the solar radio  fl ux at 10.7 cm, which correlates strongly with the \nintensity of ultraviolet    sunlight. The Ap index describes the  fl uctuations of the Earth\u2019s \ngeomagnetic  fi eld and is obtained by averaging the results of ground station measure-\nments. For low  fl ying satellites with large transversal areas it is also necessary to take \ninto account the effect of lateral winds. ESA ECSS recommends the use of the HWM-\n93    6  model. The satellite\u2019s orbit correction    and attitude control    hardware must be \ndimensioned to compensate for atmospheric drag   . The compensation of external \nforces aimed at orbit maintenance    calls for the performance of possibly frequent orbit \ncontrol    maneuvers in the case of large satellites  fl ying at low altitudes during solar \nmaximum    periods, and requiring a  fi ne control of orbital trajectory. Frequent maneu-\nvers of this kind will be a burden to the delivery of mission products    and to satellite \noperations    in general. The aerodynamic forces    are mainly produced by the satellite \norbital velocity relative to the nearly steady atmosphere. The atmospheric winds at \nsatellite altitude play a minor role, apart from the rotation of the whole atmosphere \ndragged by the Earth rotation. It is worth mentioning that the aerodynamic drag is \nalso a source of important disturbance torques    for low  fl ying satellites.  \n\n    9.2.4.   Solar radiation \n\n Satellites receive electromagnetic radiation    from many sources, the Sun    being the \ndominant one among them. Radiation from the Sun is approximately equal to radia-\ntion from a black body    emitting at a temperature of 5,762 K 7  (Figure  9.3 ). This energy \nwill illuminate and heat the satellite and will provide electrical energy to those satel-\nlites carrying solar cells   . The intensity of the illumination is fairly constant, varying \nless than 0.1% throughout the ~11-year solar cycle. The Earth    is ~1.5 10 8  km from \nthe Sun and at that distance, the integrated energy of the Sun is 1.371 kW/m 2 . The \nEarth\u2019s orbit is not completely circular, and due to this, the Sun\u2019s energy reaching a \nsatellite orbiting the Earth varies by \u00b13.5 % throughout the year.  \n\n Besides the uniformity of the Sun   \u2019s overall radiation, its ultraviolet    component \nvaries with the ~11-year solar cycle as well as with the 27-day equatorial solar rota-\ntion. This variation ranges from about 50% for the slower near ultraviolet frequencies \nto a factor of 2 for ultraviolet\u2019s faster ones, and to many orders of magnitude for \nX-rays    frequencies. This high-energy radiation is the most important factor in the \n\n   4   Space Engineering Space Environment, ECSS   -E-10-04 A, ESA January 2000.  \n   5   Extension of the MSIS Thermosphere Model into the Middle and Lower Atmosphere, Hedin A.E., J. \nGeophys.

The ratio between total and \nre fl ected sunlight is called \u201calbedo   .\u201d The Earth\u2019s average albedo is around 0.3, but \ndepends on surface properties, and can vary between 0.05 and 0.9. The highest values \ncorrespond to the presence of clouds and snow, and the lowest to vegetation and \nocean water. The Earth also produces its own infrare   d radiation, emitting the equiva-\nlent of a black body    with a temperature of 288 K. \n\n The geometry of the Sun    with respect to the satellite is a major design driver. This \ngeometry will be described in Section  9.7  of the present chapter. The impact of the \nSun\u2019s geometry on the satellite con fi guration    and thermal design    are also quite impor-\ntant and will be examined in Sections   10.2.3     and   10.4     of the next chapter. \n\n The pressure of the solar radiation acts on the satellite and perturbs its orbit and \nattitude. The effect is very small but it is cumulative and acts continually and shall \ntake into account in the design of geostationary satellites. The deployable solar sail   , \nsymmetric with respect to the solar array   , depicted in Figure   7.2     was introduced to \nrender the satellite symmetric and compensate the torque produced by the solar radia-\ntion pressure    on the solar array.  \n\n    9.2.5.   Ionosphere radiation \n\n The Sun   , Earth   \u2019s atmosphere, and Earth\u2019s magnetic  fi eld    interact in a complex way. \nAs a result of this interaction energetic ionized particles are generated and trapped in \nspeci fi c regions of the near-Earth environment. The lower part of Earth\u2019s atmosphere \ncontains ions from an altitude of about 80 km to several thousand kilometers high. \nAt higher altitudes the magnetic  fi eld shape traps a high density of ions in regions \n\nSunlight at Top of the Atmosphere\n\nInfraredUV\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\nS\npe\n\nct\nra\n\nl I\nrr\n\nad\nia\n\nnc\ne \n\n(W\n/m\n\n2 /\nnm\n\n)\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nVisible\n\n5250\u00b0C Blackbody Spectrum\n\nRadiation at Sea Level\n\nAbsorption Bands\n\n250\n\nO3\n\nO2\nH2O\n\nH2O\n\nH2O\n\nH2O\nH2O\n\nCO2\n\n500 750 1000 1250\n\nWavelength (nm)\n\n1500 1750 2000 2250 2500\n\n  Figure 9.3.

The outer belt is at a height of between \n25,000 and 32,000 km. The inner belt reaches from 1,000 to 10,000 km. Electrically \ncharged particles will bombard and damage satellites  fl ying through these belts, caus-\ning electronics    to fail; latch-ups    and single-event upsets    will gradually harm elec-\ntronic components. Radiation in the Van Allen belts is intense and satellites must \navoid them as far as possible. The intensity of ionized particles in the near-Earth \nenvironment depends on both the Earth\u2019s magnetic  fi eld and the Sun\u2019s activity \n(Figure     9.4 ).  \n\n Computer models can provide an integrated equivalent of potentially absorbed \nradiation dosages for a speci fi c orbit, mission time, and mission life   . These and other \nmodels predict the effects of ions and neutral particles and are used to determine the \namount of shielding necessary for the protection of a satellite\u2019s electronic compo-\nnents. High radiation dosages require the use of heavy radiation shielding    and sophis-\nticated radiation-resistant components, with their corresponding higher costs. As the \nsatellite travels through the plasma it can become charged with an electrostatic poten-\ntial   . If different parts of the satellite become charged at different voltages, there is a \ndanger of a possible discharge between them, which could damage sensitive on-board \nequipment. Uniform, conductive coatings on the satellite\u2019s exterior, and grounding \nbetween its different parts will help avoid this.  \n\n    9.2.6.   The space environment outside the Earth \n\n The previous sections have described the environment around the Earth, which is \nstill the environment of most space missions. Nevertheless, missions traveling \nthrough interplanetary space or orbiting other planets    are designed for the special \nenvironment that they will encounter during their mission. The space environment    \nspecialist will provide the available information on the environment that the space \nmission is going to withstand. Tracking satellites orbiting the Moon    and Mars    has \nallowed deriving the gravity     fi eld of these celestial bodies with a reasonably good \nlevel of knowledge. Satellites visiting other planets have allowed the determination \nof magnetic or  radiation  fi elds around them. The mission design of landers and \n\n  Figure 9.4.

Venus    \nhas and a surface pressure 92 times denser than the Earth but Mars atmospheric pres-\nsure less than 1% of the pressure of the Earth. Jupiter    has a very strong radiation belt    \nand missions traveling near Jupiter must withstand this harsh environment. \nConversely, the radiation environment    of interplanetary space is rather benign and \nsatellites on interplanetary missions like Ulysses    (Section   8.3.5     and  9.6.2 ) have \ndemonstrated a very long life. The intensity of the solar radiation is inversely pro-\nportional to the square of the distance to the Sun   . When  fl ying far away from the \nSun, the reduced solar strength    results in the mission requiring large solar arrays    or \nother sources of power that must be carried on the spacecraft; Rosetta    (described in \nSection   11.4.2    ) is an example of this. However, satellites  fl ying near the Sun must \nwithstand very intense high solar  fl uxes. The solar radiation level for satellites orbit-\ning Mercury    it is between 6,249 W/m 2  and 14,389 W/m 2  depending on Mercury\u2019s \nposition along its orbit. This will have major impacts in the design of any mission \ntrying to visit Mercury.   \n\n    9.3.   Attitude and attitude types \n\n Satellites are physical objects moving freely in space, and a terminology must be \nagreed upon to de fi ne its attitude, or orientation, with respect to a reference frame. \nThe most natural reference frame is the satellite\u2019s own orbit. The orbit de fi nes three \ndirections (Figure  9.5 ): \n\n   The velocity or ram    direction  \u2022 \n  The Nadir    toward the center of the orbit  \u2022 \n  The perpendicular to the orbital plane       \u2022 \n\n  Figure 9.5.     Satellite Local Orbit Reference Frame and Satellite Attitude.          \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n244 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n There are also three directions opposite to these: the antivelocity or wake   ; the \nZenith   ; and the antinormal to the orbital plane   . The satellite attitude    and its rotations \ncan be de fi ned by reference to this frame. The Nadir    direction de fi nes a natural \n\u201cdown\u201d orientation for the mission, as well as a direction for pointing    the instru-\nments    in cases where they are surveying the body being orbited, which is normally \nthe Earth   . It will be also necessary to refer the satellite orbit with respect to a per-\nmanent \u201cinertial\u201d reference plane. In the case of satellites orbiting the Earth, the best \nreference plane is the Equatorial plane    (Figure  9.6 ). The center of the Earth will be \nthe origin of the reference frame, the Earth\u2019s North Pole    will be the Z-axis and the \nY-axis will be the Aries    Vernal Equinox    direction that de fi nes the intersection \nbetween Ecliptic    and Equatorial planes. In the case of satellites not orbiting the Earth \nit is better to use the Sun   \u2019s center of mass as a center of the reference frame and the \nEcliptic plane    as reference plane. The Z-axis will be perpendicular to the Ecliptic, \nand \u2013 again \u2013 the direction of the Vernal Equinox will provide the X-axis. That \nmeans, the Earth and Sun-centered inertial reference frames share the X-axis direc-\ntion. There are three specialized terms to de fi ne rotations: \n\n   Roll   , for rotations around the X-axis  \u2022 \n  Pitch   , for rotations around the Y-axis  \u2022 \n  Yaw   , for rotations around the Z-axis    \u2022 \n\n The following sections will provide examples of different types of satellite \nattitudes. \n\n  Figure 9.6.     Earth    and Sun   -Centered Inertial Reference Frames.       \n\n \n\n\n\n245The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n    9.3.1.    Uncontrolled satellite attitude \n\n Some missions do not require any speci fi c attitude for the satellite. The two French \nStarlette    satellites, launched in 1975 and 1993, are good examples. Starlette was a \nsmall but heavy spherical craft fully covered with mirrors that re fl ected laser pulses \nsent from the ground. The time needed for the signal\u2019s return determined the satel-\nlite\u2019s orbit with high precision, which in turn allowed measurements of the Earth   \u2019s \n fi eld of gravity   . These satellites where totally passive, and being fully covered by \nmirrors, did not need to maintain any particular attitude with respect to the ground in \norder for the laser light to re fl ect correctly back to Earth (Figure  9.7 ).   \n\n    9.3.2.   Gravity-gradient attitude control \n\n If the satellite has a long axis, the long axis will align itself naturally along the Nadir    \ndirection, passively providing a Nadir-oriented face. This is a convenient alignment \nbecause it provides a reference to the \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d directions for instrument \nobservations and communications. To be stable, the axis aligned with the local verti-\ncal shall be a minimum inertia axis, and to avoid continuous oscillations, the satellite \nshall include oscillation dampers. \n\n Gravity-gradient stabilization    provides one reference direction and constrains    two \nattitude axes, but it provides no control around yaw   . In order to control rotations \naround the yaw-axis supplementary attitude detection and actuation tools must be \nprovided. A momentum wheel that rotates around pitch    will provide gyroscopic \npointing    stability    around yaw and roll   . In other cases magnetometers    and magneto-\ntorques    are used to provide attitude sensing and actuation, supplementing the passive \ngravity   -gradient    control. \n\n This approach provides an accuracy of the order of \u00b15\u00b0, which though not high is \nsuf fi cient for many applications. A recent example is provided by the Orbcomm \n\n  Figure 9.7.

Each \nsatellite weights 42 kg and carries a 6 m-long boom that simultaneously provides gravity-\ngradient stabilization and a good Nadir   -pointed structure for locating Earth   -oriented com-\nmunication antennas   . Orbcomm uses magnetic torquers for attitude damping.   \n\n    9.3.3.   Stabilized by rotation attitude control \n\n A rotating satellite possesses a gyroscopic inertia    that will maintain its orientation in iner-\ntial space    unless perturbed by external torques   . If the satellite\u2019s spin speed is high, the \nsteadiness will be high as well, thus ensuring high pointing    stability   . The pointing accu-\nracy    provided by satellite spin is on the order of 0.1\u00b0 or better. This stability, however, can \nbe a liability in cases that require reorientating of the satellite\u2019s pointing axis because large \ntorques acting during long periods will be needed to overcome the gyroscopic inertia. \n\n To achieve stable rotation the satellite must rotate around the axis with the largest \ninertia momentum. This will govern the satellite\u2019s con fi guration    and produce drum-\nshaped satellites; ESA\u2019s ISEE-2    (Figure  9.9 ) is an example of this. Spin-stabilized    \nsatellite attitudes are measured by Sun    or Earth    sensors. Thrusters    are normally used \nfor changing the spin rate and for corrections to the direction of the spin axis. If the \nsatellite\u2019s angular momentum    vector is not perfectly aligned with the principal inertia \naxis, nutation    movements will result. Nutation can be avoided by using passive nuta-\ntion dampers   . Ulysses    is stabilized by spin as described in detail in Section  9.6.2 . \n\n  Figure 9.8.     Orbcomm Gravity   -Gradient    Stabilized Satellite (  http://www.satnews.com/\ncgi-bin/display_image.cgi?1908629056    ).       \n\n \n\nhttp://www.satnews.com/cgi-bin/display_image.cgi?1908629056\nhttp://www.satnews.com/cgi-bin/display_image.cgi?1908629056\n\n\n247The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\nAs in the case of gravity-gradient    stabilization, stabilization by rotation provides a \nreference direction and constrains    two attitude axes. Spin stabilization provides an \neasy method for highly accurate, low cost   , uncomplicated, and reliable attitude control    \nsystems, and has been used extensively in the past. Nevertheless its rigid observation \ngeometry makes them inadequate for some application and it introduces constraints on \nthe satellite\u2019s con fi guration. This will be studied in detail in Section   10.4.2    .   \n\n    9.3.4.   Dual spin and momentum bias attitude control \n\n In dual spin    satellites one part of it rotates with respect to the other. This double \nrotation can provide the gyroscopic inertia    advantage of the spin-stabilized    satel-\nlites while providing  fl exibility of pointing    for communication antennae    or instru-\nments    that would be located in the nonrotating part of the satellite. In the limit, the \nrotating part of the satellite can be reduced to just a single momentum wheel. In this \ncase the satellite, as seen from outside, does not rotate but the permanently rotating \nmomentum wheel provides the necessary momentum bias    and its associated good \npointing stability    and gyroscopic stiffness   . Iridium   , described in detail in \nSection  9.6.3 , provides an example of this design. In some cases the combined \nsatellite momentum can be reduced to zero; the satellite will not bene fi t from the \nintrinsic pointing stability provided by gyroscopic inertia, but it will enjoy maxi-\nmum pointing  fl exibility   . The Defense Support Satellite (DSP) (Figure  9.10 ) is \ncontinuously pointed toward Nadir   , observing Earth    from the geostationary orbit    \nand is used to monitor ballistic missiles with a powerful infrared    telescope   . The \nsatellite body rotates at 5.7 rpm and the telescope boresight    is tilted 7\u00b0 with respect \nto the Earth-pointed    rotating axis; the satellite\u2019s rotation allows the telescope to \nscan the surface of the Earth. To compensate for the large gyroscopic torque    \n produced by the satellite\u2019s large rotating body, DSP satellites feature an exception-\n\n  Figure 9.9.

Inertially stabilized attitude control \n\n Inertially stabilized    satellites can point in any direction and keep or change the pointing    \ndirection, as the mission requires. This provides the highest possible  fl exibility for the \nsatellite attitude   . In order to achieve this, the satellite\u2019s attitude control    features a servo-\nsystem possessing sensors, actuators, feedback control loops, and control logic. This is \nthe broadest attitude control strategy and it uses a large range of attitude sensors   , actua-\ntors, and control logic as required by attitude agility   , accuracy, and stability require-\nments. In the past this approach was considered to be complex and expensive, but \nadvances in digital technology have allowed the use of inertial attitude control on more \ninexpensive satellites. The low cost    DMC    family of satellites (Section   11.4.4    ) is an \nexample of this. It is possible to divide inertially stabilized    satellites into three groups:\n\n    \u2022 Nadir     -pointed : Nadir-pointed    satellites face the central body    they are orbiting, usu-\nally Earth   . This is the required attitude for Earth-observing satellites    and is used \nfrequently. Sentinel-3    (Section  9.6.1 ) offers a good example of this kind of \nmission.  \n   \u2022 Agile     , Nadir     -pointed : In some cases, Earth   -observ   ing satellites require rapid \nrepointing    within a large area around the Nadir direction. This provides the neces-\nsary pointing  fl exibility    for observing small areas of special interest in exceptional \ndetail. Pleiades    (Section  9.6.4 ) provides an example of this.  \n   \u2022 Inertially pointed     :  These satellites can be pointed in any direction within inertial \nspace   . All the astronomical observatory    missions    mentioned in Section   7.2     are of \nthis type.      \n\n  Figure 9.10.

Orbits and orbit types \n\n The selection of a satellite\u2019s orbit necessarily entails the selection of all the \nparameters de fi ning it. Orbit de fi nition consists of six parameters:\n\n   The longitude of the ascending node    and the orbit inclination   , which de fi ne the \u2022 \nplane of the orbit within inertial space     \n  The semi-major axis   , the eccentricity,    and the argument of the periapsis   , which \u2022 \nde fi ne the orbit within its orbital plane     \n  The satellite anomaly   , which de fi nes the satellite\u2019s position within its orbit    \u2022 \n\n  The longitude of the ascending node      ( W )  is the angle from the origin of latitude to \nthe direction of the ascending node    of the orbit. The ascending node is the point where \nthe orbit crosses the reference plane in the ascending direction. For orbits around the \nEarth    the reference plane is the equatorial plane   , and the Aries    direction (the direction \nof the crossing of the equatorial and ecliptic planes) is the origin. For heliocentric    \norbits the reference plane is the ecliptic and the Aries direction is also the reference. \n\n  Inclination (i)  is the angle between the plane of the orbit and the reference plane. \n  Eccentricity (e)  de fi nes the shape of the orbit, which, in the case of Newtonian \n\norbits around a point mass, is a conic section. Circles have an eccentricity    of 0; \nellipses of increasing elongation have eccentricities from 0 to 1; parabolas have an \neccentricity of 1; and the hyperbola    an eccentricity larger than 1. \n\n The  semi-major axis      (a)  de fi nes the size of the orbit. In elliptical orbits this is one-\nhalf of the longest diameter or the major axis of the ellipse   . \n\n The  argument of periapsis      ( w )  is the angle from the periapsis (the point of closest \napproach to the central body   ) to the ascending node    (Figure  9.11 ).  \n\nCelestial body\n\nTrue anomaly\n\nArgument of periapsis\n\nLongitude of ascending node\n\nInclination\ni\n\nAscending node\n\nOrb\nit\n\nPlane of reference\n\nReference\ndirection\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n  Figure 9.11.     Orbital Parameters De fi nition (  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Orbit1.svg    ).       \n\n \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Orbit1.svg\n\n\n250 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  The anomaly ( u )  is the angular distance from the satellite to the periapsis   . \n In addition to the six parameters de fi ned above, there are three useful supplemen-\n\ntary parameters that are functions of these six: \n  Local time of the ascending node     de fi nes the angle of the orbit with respect to the Sun    \n\nby providing the local solar time on the ground just below the satellite when it crosses \nover the equator   . This parameter is used to de fi ne the orbit of Earth-observing satellites   . \n\n  Orbital period     is the time needed for the satellite to complete an orbit and is a \nfunction of the semi-major axis   . \n\n  Altitude over the Earth     is variable due to orbit eccentricities and the Earth being \nnonspherical. Normally the altitude over the Earth    is de fi ned as the semi-major axis    \nminus the equatorial radius of the Earth. This parameter is useful for understanding \nthe observing conditions of satellites in Earth orbit. \n\n    9.4.1.   Low Earth Orbit (LEO   ) \n\n    9.4.1.1.   General \n Low Earth Orbits    (LEO   ), as the name implies, is any orbit around the Earth at relatively \nlow altitude. Launchers    can reach LEO orbits with moderate amounts of energy. LEO \norbits are also suitable for missions studying the Earth in detail because the distance \nfrom satellite to surface allows the observation of  fi ne details without large instruments   . \nSatellites studying the LEO local environment \u2013 for example, those studying the Earth\u2019s \nmagnetic  fi eld    or its atmospheric density    \u2013 also use LEO. The typical altitude range for \nthese orbits is from 500 to 900 km. At lower altitudes the atmospheric density is high, \nand missions  fl ying below 500 km need progressively more complex orbit control    com-\nponents, including large amounts of fuel. Aeolus    (8.3.1) orbits at 400 km to simplify its \nactive optical Lidar, but it needs to carry 266 kg of fuel for a satellite dry mass    (total \nmass excluding fuel) of 1,100 kg. ESA\u2019s GOCE    (10.3.1) is able to  fl y at 250 km but \nrequires continuous electric propulsion    for drag compensation. The harsh radiation \nenvironment    of the Van Allen    belts determines the LEO\u2019s upper limit. CNES\u2019s Jason    \nmission  fl ies at an altitude of 1,336 km. To withstand the resulting harsh radiation envi-\nronment Jason requires the use of special protection. \n\n Orbit altitude is also in fl uenced by the mission\u2019s observing needs; lower altitudes \nare preferable for missions requiring high-resolution    image of small areas, while \nhigher altitudes are preferable for those employing large swath    instruments    of moder-\nate resolution. A typical high-resolution mission like Pleiades    (Section  9.6.4 )  fl ies at \nan altitude of 694 km, while a typical large swath mission such as Sentinel-3    \n(Section  9.6.1 ) orbits at 800 km. \n\n Orbit altitude has clear implications for mission operations    and contact opportuni-\nties with Earth   ; the higher the altitude, the longer the contacts with the ground. \nA typical 90-min low Earth orbit    provides around 10 min of visibility for each ground \nstation. Ground station visibility will be studied in Chapters   11     and   12    .  \n\n    9.4.1.2.   High inclination \n In these orbits, the angle between the satellite velocity and the rotational speed of \nthe Earth    is close to 90\u00b0; therefore, the Earth\u2019s rotational speed cannot help the \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\n\n\n251The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\nlauncher    and reaching high inclination orbits    requires more energy than reaching \nlow inclination ones. The small European launcher Vega   , launched from Kourou, \nGuyana, near the Equator   , can put ~2,000 kg into a circular orbit at 800 km with \nan inclination of 0\u00b0, but only ~1,500 km at a 90\u00b0 inclination. High inclination \nLEO    orbits, on the other hand, provide global or near-global coverage of the \nEarth, which makes them ideal for missions studying the entire Earth. High incli-\nnation orbits also ensure frequent contact with ground stations    located at high \nlatitudes    near the Poles, facilitating good communications between satellite and \nground. \n\n Figure  9.12  provides the track pattern of the radar altimetry    mission Jason   . The \norbit, as mentioned above, has an altitude of 1,336 km and an inclination of 66\u00b0. Its \norbital period    is adjusted so that the orbit repeats its ground track    pattern every 127 \norbits, in slightly less than 10 days. Jason acts as a reference mission for determining \nsea levels    and ocean circulation    with extreme accuracy. The mission\u2019s altitude is \ndriven by the need to minimize gravity and orbit drag perturbations    in order to pro-\nvide the highest orbital determination accuracy. The inclination is driven by the \ncon fl icting needs of covering a majority of the oceans while ensuring a good geom-\netry in the crossing points that act as reference tie-downs and shall be located as well \nas possible. Jason\u2019s orbit also acts to minimize the effects of the tides on the measure-\nment of average sea levels. The communications constellation    Iridium    (Section  9.6.3 ) \nalso utilizes LEO    high inclination orbits   , in the case of Iridium in order to provide \ntrue global communications coverage for Earth   .   \n\n2008-Oct-14 11:38:51 UTC\nLat : 0.0000\nLon : 0.0000\nMLST : 11:38:51\nSZA : 8.56 deg\nRange : 16165 km\nAltitude : 16165 km\n\nJason-1\n\nSAVOIR - Swath Acquisition Viewer - \u00a9 European Space Agency - Taitus Software\n\n  Figure 9.12.

LEO    low inclination \n Low inclination    LEO    orbits maximize the launcher   \u2019s mass injection capability   , making \nthe orbit ideal for applications not requiring any speci fi c observation geometry, for \ninstance, microgravity or technology demonstration missions, or those with crews. Low \ninclination satellites    do not provide coverage of the entire Earth    but they do offer rapid \ncoverage of the limited areas they  fl y over. This has clear advantages for missions \nwhose area of interest    is limited to equatorial or tropical regions   , such as those studying \nhurricanes or other intense, dynamic tropical events. NASA\u2019s Tropical Rainfall \nMonitoring Mission (TRMM   ) and CNES-ISRO MeghaTropiques    (Section   8.3.4    ) study \ntropical weather patterns. TRMM\u2019s orbit has an inclination of 35\u00b0, and that of \nMeghaTropiques   , 20\u00b0. Summer forest  fi res    are common in areas with a Mediterranean \nclimate located around 40\u00b0 of latitude; so an inclination of about 40\u00b0 would be optimal \nfor a mission aimed at detecting and monitoring forest  fi res in these areas.   \n\n    9.4.2.   LEO    Sun-synchronous    orbit \n\n Sun-synchronous    orbits    have an inclination such that the J2    term of the Earth\u2019s grav-\nity     fi eld    (Section  9.2.1 ) generates a precession    of one turn per year of the orbital \nplane   ; that is, the orbital plane rotates at the same speed as the Sun. This ensures a \nfairly constant angle between the orbital plane and the direction of the Sun. The angle \nis only \u201cfairly\u201d constant due to the seasonal variations produced by the angle between \nthe equatorial plane    of the Earth and the ecliptic plane    of the Sun (Figure  9.13 ).  \n\n Sun-synchr   onous orbits have  fi ve strong advantages:\n\n   The inclination corresponding to LEO    Sun-synchr   onous orbits is close to the polar \u2022 \none, allowing almost full Earth    coverage. For the typical range of Earth-orbiting \naltitudes between 500 and 1,000 km, this inclination varies from 97.4\u00b0 to 99.5\u00b0.  \n  This fairly constant Sun    geometry produces uniform lighting conditions    of the \u2022 \nobservation area. The uniform illumination of the observation area allows a \n correspondingly consistent quality in the images produced, and all images of the \nsame area taken during the mission are easily compared.  \n  The geometry of the Sun    with respect to the satellite is constant, allowing one side \u2022 \nof the satellite to be consistently lit by the Sun, and another that will never be, thus \nsimplifying the spacecraft\u2019s con fi guration    and thermal design   .  \n\n  Figure 9.13.     Sun   -Synchronous Orbits and Sun Geometry Along the Year.       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n253The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n  The high inclination orbits    allows for frequent contacts with ground stations    \u2022 \nlocated at high latitudes    near the poles.  \n  The Nadir   -oriented face is pointed toward the planet being orbited and is the logi-\u2022 \ncal place for locating the instruments    and communication antennas   .    \n\n The  fi rst three advantages are relevant to the mode of observation, while the last \ntwo are directly related to the con fi guration   . All these advantages explain the popular-\nity of this kind of orbit for providing global observations of the Earth   . Earth observa-\ntion    normally requires regular orbital patterns for optimal Earth coverage, revisits, \nand repetitive contact patterns with ground stations   . This is why most Earth observa-\ntion missions exactly repeat their orbital track    patterns, where  m  orbital periods coin-\ncide with  n  solar days. This is the case of Sentinel-2    (Figure  9.14 ) where 143 orbits \nlast 10 solar days.  \n\n The local time    of the ascending node    was introduced at the beginning of \nSection  9.4 . The selection of this parameter, which de fi nes the geometry of the Sun    \nwith respect to the satellite and the area being observed, must take into account the \nmission\u2019s objectives. Local times near 6:00 or 18:00 de fi ne an almost constant geom-\netry with the solar direction close to the perpendicular of the orbital plane   . This \nsimpli fi es the design of the satellite con fi guration   , allowing for the easy production \nof solar energy and the easy dissipation of heat. Lighting conditions, however, are \npoor because the Sun is just above or below the horizon of the areas being observed \nand cannot properly illuminate them. Hence, these orbits are only suitable for mis-\nsions in which solar illumination is unnecessary for the effective observation of their \ntargets. This is the case of Synthetic Aperture Radars    (SAR   \u2019s). Local times around \n12:00 provide adequate illumination of the solar array    with a single axis rotation \nperpendicular to the orbital plane, but images taken from the satellite right at Zenith    \nare  fl at and of poor quality, so this orbit is rarely used. Intermediate local times    from \n\nSentinel-2.1Range : 16165 km\nAltitude : 16165 km\n\n  Figure 9.14.     Sentinel-2   -1 Orbit. The Orbital Period    Is such that the Orbital Tracks over the \nEarth    Repeat Every 10 Solar Days and 143 Orbits.       \n\n \n\n\n\n254 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n8:00 to 10:30 are considered ideal for optical Earth observations   , and most missions \nof this sort  fl y around 10:00; these include Ikonos   , Spot   , Landsat   , Sentinel-3,    and \nSentinel-2   . An additional advantage of this local time is that any early morning mist \nhas dissipated but late afternoon tropical clouds have not yet formed, permitting clear \nviewing with minimum cloud cover. Observations from each Sun-synchronous    orbit    \nare made just twice a day: one during the ascending and another during the descend-\ning orbital track   , and only one of the two will be made with solar illumination. If the \nmission requires frequent observations, a constellation of satellites  fl ying at different \nlocal times offers a solution. The operational meteorological constellation NPOESS    \n(Figure  9.15 ) is an example, and employs three satellites, which renew the informa-\ntion covering the Earth every 4 h.  \n\n To ensure the uniformity of observing conditions, Earth-orbiting satellites    should \nmaintain as constant a distance to the surfaces being observed as possible. As the \nEarth is not perfectly spherical, however, actual orbits cannot be perfectly circular \nand the distance between the satellite and ground changes all along the orbital path    \n(Figure  9.16 ). The situation becomes even more complex when taking into account \nthat the higher-order gravity    terms J2   , J3,    and J12    (Section  9.2.1 ) will affect the \neccentricity    \u201ce\u201d and argument of perigee    \u201c w \u201d of the orbit. This will further increase \nthe variations in the distance from satellite to ground. Nevertheless, certain combina-\ntions of initial eccentricity and argument of perigee help stabilize the long-term evo-\nlution of both parameters, minimizing these variations in the orbital altitude of the \nsatellite. These latter orbits are known as frozen orbits    8  and Sun-synchronous mis-\nsions employ them extensively. For the commonest altitude range of around 800 km, \nthe initial parameters providing a frozen orbit correspond to an eccentricity around \n0.001 and an \u201c w \u201d around 90\u00b0.

MEO    \n\n Mid-altitude Earth\u2019s orbits (MEO   ) can be de fi ned as comprising from the 1,200 km \naltitude of the higher LEO    orbits to the 35,786 km altitude of the geostationary orbits   . \nIn terms of orbital period   , this includes from 100 min to 24 h. This is a broad range, \nbut missions utilizing these altitudes are infrequent because the radiation of the Van \nAllen    belts creates an unfriendly environment for satellites, limiting orbital possibili-\nties to the area around 20,000 km above the inner belt, but still below the outer one. \nThe long periods of MEO orbits provide for relatively slow transits of the satellite in \nrelation to the Earth\u2019s surface, offering prolonged uninterrupted visibility of large \nparts of the Earth. This is especially advantageous for navigational satellite constel-\nlations    like GPS    or Galileo   , and both these constellations  fl y circular MEO orbits. \nTheir high altitude also offers low levels of gravity    and atmospheric density    perturba-\ntions, allowing precise determination of each satellite\u2019s orbit, so crucial for \n navigational satellites. The GPS satellites  fl y in six uniformly distributed orbital \nplanes    at an altitude of 20,200 km, with an orbit inclination    of 55\u00b0 (Figure  9.17 ). \nMolniya    orbits are another type of MEO. These orbits have an inclination of 63.4\u00b0 or \n116.6\u00b0. At this inclination the Earth\u2019s J2    component produces no drift    of the right \nascension of the ascending node   . Molniya orbits are highly eccentric and feature \nperiods in resonance with the Earth\u2019s rotation   , of either 12 or 24 h. These orbits cross \nthe Van Allen belts, and satellites employing them must be designed to withstand the \nharsh radiation environment   .

This is useful for missions calling for the effective monitoring \nof these regions. Molniya orbits have been used extensively by Russia to provide \ncommunications over its territory.    \n\n    9.4.4.   Geosynchronous    and geostationary orbits \n\n Geosynchronous    orbits    are orbits with a period of 24 h. Geostationary (GEO   ) orbits \nare geosynchronous    orbits with an eccentricity    and orbit inclination    of zero. GEO \norbits provide a constant relative geometry between Earth   \u2019s surface and the satellite, \naffording permanent monitoring of wide areas of the Earth and permanent communi-\ncation links from them to the satellite. The geostationary orbit    is the orbit of choice \nfor communication satellites   . GEO satellites are also used for operational meteorol-\nogy   . A single GEO satellite only provides visibility over one area; to provide global \nvisibility over most of the Earth, three or four satellites are needed. Nevertheless, \nGEO satellites, whose orbit is in the equatorial plane   , cannot observe or be observed \nfrom the poles. The present GEO meteorological operational constellation is made up \nof four GEO satellites, two provided by the U.S., one by Europe and one by Japan. \n\n The distance from a GEO    satellite to the ground is 35,786 km. The communications \nlink between the satellite and Earth    must be strong enough to compensate for this great \ndistance. In the case of Earth observation    satellites the spatial resolution    obtained from \nGEO orbits will be correspondingly inferior to that normally obtained from LEO    \norbits. The best communications and observation geometry is over the equator    where \nthe satellite is directly overhead; the geometry degrades when moving toward the \nPoles. At 76.3\u00b0 latitude geostationary satellites are just 5\u00b0 above the local horizon. This \nlow elevation    is considered a practical limit for good quality communication links, \nbecause the signal becomes increasingly affected by the thickness of atmosphere. The \nobservation geometry of high latitude regions of the Earth will also be severely dis-\ntorted by the wide angle between the line of sight    of the satellite and the ground hori-\nzon   . The geometrical distortion of images was studied in Section   8.4.3    . GEO \nobservations above 60\u00b0 of latitude are of questionable quality, due to the distorted \ngeometry, the thickness of the atmosphere being traversed by the signals and the low \nlevel of solar illumination at these high latitudes   . GEO orbits are located in the equato-\nrial plane    and the Sun    is in the ecliptic plane    (Figure  9.19 ), so for half the year the Sun \nwill be \u201cabove\u201d a GEO satellite\u2019s orbital plane   , and half the year \u201cbelow\u201d it.  \n\nEquatorial plane\n\nEcliptic\n plane\n\nMSG-2\n\n  Figure 9.19.

Even so, while observing one \npole, the other will not be visible to the satellite, so a single satellite will not afford \ncontinuous observing capabilities, which is precisely the strongest asset of geosyn-\nchronous observations. Three or four satellites are needed for continuous observation \nof both poles; as this is generally unpractical, Molniya    orbits (Section  9.4.3 ) are \n preferred for high latitude specialized satellites. IUE    (Section   7.2.1    ) used a geosyn-\nchronous nongeostationary orbit to provide continuous communication links with \neither of the two ground stations    used for both missions: one in the USA and one in \nEurope (Figure  9.20 ). In order to precisely maintain their orbit, satellites in GEO    \nmust struggle against two kinds of disturbances: \n\n   Those that alter the orbit inclination   , shifting the orbital track    over the Earth   . They \u2022 \nare caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun    and Moon    nudging the satellite \naway from the equatorial plane   . The result is a 1\u00b0 increase of the orbit inclination \nper year, reaching a maximum of 15\u00b0 in 17 years, when the effect will start to \nreverse itself.  \n  Those causing the satellite\u2019s track over the Earth    to shift with an east-west orienta-\u2022 \ntion. The Earth\u2019s equatorial circumference is not perfectly circular (a fact repre-\nsented by the J22 gravity    term). J22 will produce a slow motion drift    of the GEO    \nsatellite track around stable longitudes, coinciding with the minor radius of the \nEarth and located at longitudes 75.3\u00b0 E and 255.3\u00b0 E.    \n\n  Figure 9.20.     Ground Track of the Geosynchronous    IUE   .       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n259The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n In most missions, it is necessary to control these orbital perturbations. The MSG    \nsatellite depicted in Figure   7.3     uses around 11% 9  of its propellant load of 976 kg for \nnorth-south correction, and 4% for east-west correction. The remaining 83% is \nneeded to inject the satellite into the  fi nal GEO    orbit from the intermediate highly \nelliptical geosynchronous transfer orbit provided by the Ariane    launcher   . A geosyn-\nchronous transfer orbit (GTO   ) is an intermediate orbit used to reach GEO. It is highly \nelliptic    with an apogee    at the GEO altitude and a perigee    at a few hundred kilometers \nof altitude. Many launchers, like Ariane, inject the satellites they carry into GTO and \nthe satellites themselves should carry enough fuel to allow their own transfer from the \nGTO to GEO.  \n\n    9.4.5.   Longer period Earth    orbit \n\n Very long period orbits    (more than 24 h) are useful for situating satellites far from \nEarth    and its perturbations, affording long uninterrupted observation periods of the \ncelestial sphere   . This is especially bene fi cial for astronomical research; XMM-\nNewton    (Figure   7.8    ) is a prime example; its orbit features 7,365 km at perigee   , \n113,774 at apogee   , an orbit inclination    of 49\u00b0 and an orbital period    of 2 days \n(Figure  9.22 ). While near the apogee, the orbit permits up to 30 h of uninterrupted \nobservations, always pointing    toward the same direction in space, and remaining well \nabove the Earth\u2019s radiation belts    and their potential impact on the instruments   . \nCluster    (Section   11.4.1     and Figure  9.21 ) is a constellation of four satellites carrying \nin situ    measuring instruments in slightly different orbits with 25,500 km of perigee, \n125,000 km of apogee, and at inclination of 90\u00b0. The orbits were chosen for optimal \nanalysis of the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere    and the Sun-Earth interaction environment. \nThe highly inclined, very elliptical orbit permits measurements through broad areas \nof the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere   , the instruments sampling various distances to the Earth \nand different latitudes of the magnetosphere, from those nearest the Earth\u2019s equatorial \nplane    to those closest to the poles.    \n\n    9.4.6.   Lagrangian    points \n\n Lagrangian    points    are locations in space where a satellite\u2019s orbital motion is balanced \nby the gravity    of two large objects, and hence remains stationary with respect to them. \nThey are stationary solutions of the circular \u201cthree-body problem.\u201d The Lagrangian \npoints of the Earth   -Sun    system are of particular importance because satellites orbiting \nat these points will maintain a constant geometry with respect to the Earth and the \nSun. There are  fi ve Lagrangian points in the Earth-Sun system, and two of them, L1    \nand L2   , are useful for space missions. L1 is the point between the Earth and Sun \nwhere their gravity is equal and is situated along the Earth-Sun line and around 1.5 \nmillion km from the Earth. This orbit is ideal for continuous monitoring of the Sun \nfree of perturbations caused by the Earth. ESA/NASA\u2019s Soho    mission, who carries \nSun observing instruments   , is situated at the L1 point, as was NASA\u2019s ISEE-3   , which \n\n   9   Meteosat Second Generation.

The L2 point is \nalso situated about 1.5 million km from Earth, but behind it, on the side opposite the \nSun. JWST    (Sections   8.3.2     and   10.3.2    ) uses this orbit. Satellites in L1 and L2 not only \nmaintain a constant geometry with respect to the Earth and the Sun, they also enjoy \nextreme protection against the optical and thermal perturbations caused by the Earth \nand Sun for instruments needing high sensitivity and accuracy, such as those detect-\ning remote or weak astronomical signals. Notwithstanding the above description, \norbits located precisely at the L1 or L2 positions do suffer from instability, and satel-\nlites located at either of the two points will gradually drift    away. There are trajectories \njust to the side of L1 and L2 called \u201chalo\u201d orbits, which only demand a moderate level \n\n  Figure 9.21.     Orbits of the Four Cluster    Satellites.

Interplanetary orbits \n\n Interplanetary orbits are necessary for missions requiring the observation of \u201cin situ\u201d    \nevents located in interplanetary space, or when the study of remote celestial bodies \nrequires close-up examination.  \n\n Ulysses    (Sections   8.3.5     and  9.6.2 ) is an example of a mission carrying out in situ    \nobservations of regions remote from the ecliptic plane    and that requires an orbit able \nto propel the satellite through the high solar latitude zones of the heliosphere \n(Figure  9.23 )   . Ulysses used Jupiter    to perform a massive change of orbit inclination    \nin order to reach its targeted orbit. The satellite employed the two dedicated large \nrockets stages IUS    and PAM    (Figure  9.27 ) to attain its goal. Rosetta    (Section   11.4.2    ) \nis another mission following a complex interplanetary path in order to observe two \nasteroids on its way to a rendezvous    with the comet that is its  fi nal target. Rosetta\u2019s \norbit is especially complex. It was launched from Kourou in March 2004 and includes \nthree Earth    swing-by    maneuvers, one swing-by maneuver with Mars   , two along-the-\nway swing-bys with asteroids Lutetia    and Steins   , and the  fi nal rendezvous with the \ncomet in November of 2014. The mission will last 10 years.  \n\n    9.4.8.

For orbiting satellites, the observational \npatterns of the craft over the planet will depend on the planet\u2019s rotation speed, and, \nas with orbits around the Earth   , on the planet\u2019s degree of deviation from the spherical. \nMars    has a very thin atmosphere, so orbit altitudes    can be much lower than those \naround the Earth, allowing high-resolution observations with proportionally smaller \noptics. The  fi nal orbit of ESA\u2019s Mars Express around Mars (Figure  9.24 ) had an \ninclination of 86\u00b0, 10,107 km of apogee    over the surface of the planet and 298 km of \nperigee   , with an orbital period    of 6.7 h.    \n\n    9.5.   Mission phases and modes and satellite attitude \n\n Throughout the life of a satellite, it passes through phases requiring different attitudes \nor attitude control    approaches. Each of these attitude control approaches is called a \n\u201cmission mode   .\u201d The following phases and their corresponding attitude modes are \ntypical:\n\n   Initialization   . This phase begins when the launcher    releases the satellite and ends \u2022 \nwhen the satellite has acquired a safe attitude    that ensures adequate power produc-\ntion, thermal dissipation, and communications. During this phase, the satellite will \nhave also switched-on all the components necessary for ensuring its own unlimited \nsurvival. That is, the satellite  fi nishes in a \u201csafe mode   \u201d where the attitude and \nattitude control    ensure the satellite\u2019s secure operation during an unlimited period \nof time.  \n  Commissioning   . This begins when the satellite recon fi gures itself by deploying all \u2022 \nthe mechanisms    not yet deployed during the initialization phase and progressively \nswitching-on, calibrating, and characterizing all the satellite\u2019s platform    and instru-\nment components. This phase ends with the satellite in a \u201cnominal mode   \u201d and \nattitude, ready to perform all its functions.  \n\n90.0\nLA\n\nT\nIT\n\nU\nD\n\nE\n (\n\nD\nE\n\nG\n)\n\n60.0\n\n30.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u201330.0\n\n\u201360.0\n\n\u201390.0\n\n\u2013180.0 \u2013150.0\n\nMARSEXPG3B(2005-03-09 22:14:38.)

The satellite begins to acquire observation data as speci fi ed by the mis-\nsion\u2019s aims. During this phase the satellite maintains its nominal mode    with its \nnominal attitude   .  \n  Orbit control   . This mode will be activated regularly during short periods. The \u2022 \nsatellite will suspend data acquisition in order to perform orbit correction   ,  fi ring \nits thrusters    as needed. The satellite may need to perform large attitude change \nmaneuvers to orientate the thrusters in the direction required by the orbital control    \nneeds.  \n  In case of major satellite failure the satellite enters into safe mode   . In this mode \u2022 \nthe satellite has a safe attitude    that can be maintained permanently without danger \nand with most of the satellite inoperative.  \n  Dormant mode. Missions that require being minimally active during long \u2022 \n periods of time will require this mode. For example Rosetta    (Section   11.4.2    ) is \nin a dormant mode    during most of its long  fl y to arrive to its intended comet \ntarget.  \n  Deorbiting   . This phase is activated at the end of the mission. The satellite could be \u2022 \nrequired to perform dedicated orbit correction    maneuvers to ensure reentry    into \nEarth   \u2019s atmosphere. This step is taken to prevent the no-longer operational satel-\nlite from posing a danger to future space missions in the form of space debris   . \nDuring the \u201cdeorbiting   \u201d mode, much of the spacecraft\u2019s electronics    will be \nswitched off and fuel purged from the tanks   .    \n\n These phases and modes can vary according to the needs of each mission; for \nexample, missions orbiting Mars    will not require deorbiting   ; some missions may \nnot need an orbit control    mode. Nevertheless, in order to ensure the satellite\u2019s \nsafety, all missions require the safe mode    in which the most important parameter \nis design robustness, and the nominal mode   , guaranteeing the degree of accuracy \nin the delivery of products demanded by the mission. These two modes require \ndifferent sets of sensors and actuators, as well as different attitude control    loops. \nThe robust attitude control of the safe mode requires the use of reliable perfor-\nmance sensors, actuators, and control logic. This permits the attitude control to \ncontinue functioning even when a large part of the satellite\u2019s components are \ndisabled or intentionally switched off. Sensors suitable for the safe mode include \nmagnetometers    or Sun sensors   ; suitable actuators include magneto-torquers    and \nwheels utilized solely in open loops to provide gyroscopic stiffness   . Control logic \ncan be digital or analog, as long as it can function adequately when the satellite\u2019s \nmain digital computers are inactive. The more accurate attitude control of the \nnominal mode can be achieved by using Earth or star sensors    and momentum \nwheels    managed by digital control loops. The control loop is likely to be digital \nand reside in the satellite\u2019s central computer or in one dedicated solely to attitude \ncontrol. \n\n Figure  9.25  provides the on-ground and in-orbit satellite modes    of Sentinel-3   . The \noff mode, test mode, and stand-by mode are ground modes to allow satellite testing. \nThe launch mode is the mode of the satellite while attached to the launcher   . All the \nother modes have been already explained. Modes transitions can be performed under \ntelecommand    (TC) or autonomously (Auto).   \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n264 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    9.6.   Orbit and attitude examples \n\n    9.6.1.   Sentinel-3    \n\n The aims and instruments    of this operational Earth observation    mission were intro-\nduced in Section   8.3.3    . This section will examine Sentinel-3   \u2019s orbit and attitude. \n\n    9.6.1.1.   Orbit \n Sentinel-3    10   fl ies in a Sun-synchronous    orbit    with an inclination of 98.65\u00b0and a semi-\nmajor axis    of 7,178 km, which is equivalent to an orbital altitude of 800 km. The \norbital period    is 6,059 s. To afford optimal coverage for land and sea images and for \nocean altimetry   , the satellite has a repetitive orbital pattern of 385 orbits every 27 \ndays, which is equivalent to 14 + 7/27 orbits per day. As 7/27 is near to \u00bc, the pattern \nrepeats itself almost exactly every 4 days. This permits optimal coverage for optical \nobservation in 4 days \u2013 or in 2 days using two satellites in the same orbit but separated \nby 180\u00b0 \u2013 and in 27 days for ocean altimetry. The local time    of the ascending node    of \nthe orbital plane    is 10:00. The orbit is frozen with an eccentricity    of 0.001148 and \nwith an argument of the perigee    of 90\u00b0 (Figure  9.26 ).  \n\n The satellite needs to control its orbit so that the actual ground track    does not devi-\nate from the nominal one by more than \u00b11 km. For all its orbit control    needs, \nSentinel-3    carries 120 kg of hydrazine    and two sets of four 1 N thrusters   . The thrust-\ners are used for the correction of initial orbital injection errors   , for orbit control and \nfor deorbiting    the satellite at the end of its operational life   , when the thrusters will \n\nO\nF\n\nF\nM\n\node\n\nP\now\n\ner-O\nF\n\nF\n\nF\nailure\n\nF\nailure\n\nor T\nC\n\nLaunch\nM\n\node\n\nInit\nS\n\nequence\n\nA\nuto\n\nF\nailure\n\nS\nafe\n\nM\node\n\nN\norm\n\nal\nM\n\node\nO\n\nrb.

The GPS is also used \nto provide real-time satellite position with an accuracy in the order of 10 m. Orbit \ncorrection maneuvers are only undertaken by ground command.  \n\n    9.6.1.2.    Attitude \n Sentinel-3   \u2019s attitude and orbit control    system is Nadir   -pointing   , three-axis stabilized    \nwith \u201cyaw steering   .\u201d The latter feature is needed because in the nominal attitude    \nmode the satellite points downward, keeping the instruments    perpendicular to the \nEarth   \u2019s surface. In yaw steering the satellite steers itself around the yaw direction to \ncompensate for the image distortion caused by the Earth\u2019s rotation   . This requires a \nyaw rotation of 4\u00b0 at the equator    and progressively decreasing until 0\u00b0 at the poles, \nthese changes occurring around the orbit with twice the orbital frequency. \n\n In the high-accuracy nominal mode   , the attitude control    is based on four reaction \nwheels. By varying the speed of the wheels it is possible to provide carefully con-\ntrolled torques    around any desired direction. An optical head with three star trackers \nprovides the satellite attitude    and attitude rates. If one of the three star sensors were \nto fail, attitude and attitude rates could still be provided, albeit with a correspondingly \ndegraded performance. The speed of the wheels is kept at acceptable levels by the use \nof magneto-torquers   . The correct magneto-torque    settings depend on the Earth\u2019s \n\n  Figure 9.26.     Sentinel-3    A and B Orbit and 1 Day of Ground Track    of both Satellites.       \n\n \n\n\n\n266 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n   magnetic  fi eld, whose strength    is derived from an on-board model of the  fi eld along \nwith the satellite\u2019s position, provided by the GNSS sensor. In the nominal mode, the \npointing    error is better than 0.1\u00b0 and the attitude measurement error is better than \n0.01\u00b0. The satellite possesses a nonnominal safe mode    that points the satellite toward \nthe Sun   , providing power and thermal conditions compatible with its long-term sur-\nvival. In safe mode, Sentinel-3    employs a set of less accurate but highly reliable \nattitude sensors    and actuators. Magnetometers   , coarse Sun sensors,    and a coarse gyro-\nscope    provide attitude sensing. The magnetotorquer    provides attitude control and the \nwheels provide gyroscopic stability   , but they stay in open loop and are not used for \nattitude correction. In this mode the strength and direction of the magnetic  fi eld is \nprovided by magnetometers   . The satellite also has an orbit control    mode, which is \nused to perform large out-of-plane orbital correction maneuvers. During this mode \nthe thrusters    are used for attitude control and the wheels do not operate. The attitude \nis provided by the star trackers    supplemented by the coarse rate sensors.   \n\n    9.6.2.   Ulysses    \n\n The scienti fi c mission Ulysses   , which was launched in 1990 and studied the Sun    and \nthe heliosphere   , was introduced in Section   8.3.5    . Ulysses was decommissioned in \n2008 after 18 years of life. \n\n    9.6.2.1.   Orbit \n As mentioned in 8.3.5 Ulysses   \u2019 instruments    made in situ    measurements and therefore \nhad to travel through the heliosphere    in order to study it. To provide a comprehensive \npro fi le of the heliosphere at all solar latitudes the satellite\u2019s  fi nal orbit was heliocen-\ntric   , with 1.35 AU of perihelion   , 5.4 AU of aphelion    and 80\u00b0 of inclination with \nrespect to the solar equator    (Figure  9.23 ). The satellite  fl ew from one solar pole to the \nother along all the latitudes around the Sun   , with an orbital period    of 6.2 years. \n\n In order to accomplish the principal objective of orbiting the solar poles at up to \n80\u00b0 of heliocentric    latitude, the mission called for a very special orbit injection strat-\negy, which required large amounts of energy. Ulysses   , which weighed just 370 kg, \nneeded an entire space shuttle to accommodate the satellite and one each of its IUS    \nand PAM    supplementary stages (Figure  9.27 ), which were  fi red to reach a  fi nal veloc-\nity of 15.4 km/s, making Ulysses at the time the fastest man-made object in history. \nThe satellite also required a Jupiter    swing-by    to shift the original injection orbit from \nan inclination of 23\u00b0 to the  fi nal 80\u00b0 demanded by the mission. Ulysses took 16 \nmonths of interplanetary cruising to reach Jupiter.  \n\n The satellite featured an on-board propulsion    subsystem    used for small orbital cor-\nrection maneuvers   . The satellite\u2019s position was determined by the mission control \ncente   r, which also commanded all necessary thrust    operations. The propulsion sub-\nsystem included two sets of four thrusters   , giving each of them a thrust of 2 N. The \nthrusters were fed with 33.5 kg of hydrazine    contained in a single spherical pressur-\nized tank   .  \n\n    9.6.2.2.   Attitude \n The satellite (Figure   8.10    ) is spin-stabilized    and rotates at 5 rpm around the axis \nde fi ned by the boresight    of the antenna, which is pointed continuously toward Earth   . \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n267The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\nDue to its 6.2-year orbital period   , this direction changes so slowly that it can be con-\nsidered as  fi xed in inertial space   . The primary functions of the attitude and orbit \ncontrol    subsystem    (AOCS) are to maintain the spacecraft\u2019s spin axis pointing    toward \nEarth and to maintain its spin rate at 5 rpm. Additional functions are dictated by tra-\njectory control needs, nutation    damping, and by the measurement of the attitude for \nscienti fi c reasons. The spacecraft\u2019s Earth-pointing attitude is measured and controlled \nby a system that derives spin-rate, spin-phase, and solar-aspect-angle information \nfrom redundant Sun sensors   . A related AOCS operation is the periodic precession    \nmaneuvering for correction of the gradual Earth direction drift    with respect to the spin \naxis. These operations are performed either on board in closed loop or in open loop \nvia ground or time-tagged    commands. The hydrazine    thrusters    also provide the neces-\nsary spin speed and direction control corrections. The attitude control    is supported by \na passive nutation damper   , which is a tube containing a ball in the middle of a dense \n fl uid that moves and dissipates energy when the rotation axis    nutates with respect to \nthe satellite nominal rotation axis. The satellite has one pair of 72.5 m-long wire \nbooms    kept in tension by the centrifugal force    created by the spin of the satellite. \nEach wire boom has a passive tubular damper at its root, which reduces oscillations \nbetween the boom and the spacecraft. The AOCS includes failure-mode-detection \nand protection functions, which result in fail-safe operation and a reacquisition capa-\nbility in both automatic and ground-initiated recovery sequences. The AOCS also \nprovides autonomous system capabilities for safe spacecraft recon fi guration. This is \nrequired during unexpected and/or predicted periods of nontracking and because of \nthe long signal travel time between ground and spacecraft. The satellite also has a \nsearch-mode to reacquire the Earth if no command is received after a speci fi ed time \nof up to 30 days. As explained above, to reach its  fi nal injection orbit, Ulysses    \nrequired the  fi ring of its two IUS    and PAM    stages. To provide stability, the  fi ring was \ndone at very high spin. This high spin was reduced to the nominal 5 rpm by deploying \nthe mentioned wire booms.   \n\n  Figure 9.27.     Ulysses    on Top of the IUS    and PAM    Stages (ESA achievements, BR-250, ESA \n2005).       \n\n \n\n\n\n268 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    9.6.3.    Iridium    \n\n    9.6.3.1.   Aim \n Iridium    11  is a 66-satellite constellation serving global mobile communications    that \nprovides true worldwide connectivity for cell-phones. The emitting Iridium telephone \nuplinks its signal to any visible satellite in the constellation, each of which has on-\nboard switching technology that directs the signal from satellite to satellite toward the \nmost conveniently situated neighboring satellite in the constellation. The signal will \neventually be downlinked    to either a regional gateway, which provides connectivity \nto the overall communication network, or directly to the receiving Iridium telephone. \nIridium\u2019s satellite-to-satellite capability affords broad  fl exibility in the location and \nnumber of regional gateways, which connect the network directly to the public tele-\nphone system. Each satellite can direct up to 3,840 voice circuits. Signals from the \nIridium emitting cell phone to the receiving satellite, and from the  fi nal emitting satel-\nlite to the receiving Iridium cell phone are all transmitted in the L band   . Steerable \nKa-band    terminals located on the satellites transmit the signals between the satellites \nthemselves and to and from the regional gateways. Iridium sells its services through \ncommunication companies that also provide value-added products and services that \nemploy Iridium functionalities. Each satellite\u2019s mass is 680 kg. The original design \nlife was 5\u20138 years. The satellites were launched in 1997 and 1998 but they were still \nfunctioning properly in 2009, exceeding with ample margin the design life require-\nment. The constellation will provide service until 2014 and an update for Iridium is \npresently under development.  \n\n    9.6.3.2.   Orbit \n The Iridium    constellation is distributed in six orbital planes   . The baseline constellation \nhas 66 satellites plus 12 in-orbit spares. The Iridium satellites  fl y in a LEO    circular orbit \nat an altitude of 780 km and with an inclination of 86.4\u00b0. The altitude was selected to \noptimize the communications link between the satellite and the ground-located cell-\nphones. The inclination was selected to provide maximum orbital stability while main-\ntaining an adequate separation between the satellites over the poles, avoiding danger of \ncollision. The orbital period    is 100 min and 28 s. The main requisite for the orbit design \nwas the need to provide continuous total coverage of the Earth   . Each Iridium satellite has \na large ground-pointing    antenna set providing 48 L band    overlapping spot beams \n(Figure  9.28 ). The footprint\u2019s total size is approximately 4,400 km in diameter. The orbit \nis controlled with an accuracy of 6 km across-track    and 5 km along-track. The satellites\u2019 \norbital parameters are propagated on board and updated once a week. The position of \nneighboring satellites is communicated to each satellite as a guide for the steerable cross-\nlink antennas. Seven hydrazine    thrusters    are used for initial attitude control    after launcher    \nseparation, for Earth capture, and for spin-up, ascent, and descent. An electrothermal \nhydrazine thruster is used for large orbital changes   .   \n\n    9.6.3.3.   Attitude \n Iridium   \u2019s attitude and orbit control    system provides attitude control    and orbit and \nconstellation maintenance   . In orbit, the attitude is Nadir   -pointed with the long satellite \n\n   11   An Overview of the Iridium    Low Earth Orbit Satellite System, Carl Fossa et al., 0-7803-4449-IEEE 1998.  \n\n\n\n269The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\naxis kept oriented toward Earth   . The satellite is momentum bias    stabilized. The atti-\ntude 12  is driven by the need to provide the correct visibility among all the antennas:\n\n   The three L-band    antennas to connect the satellite with the ground-based Iridium    \u2022 \ncell-phones  \n  The Ka-band    feeder link to connect with the ground-based Gateways  \u2022 \n  The Ka-band    cross-links to connect each satellite with the four nearest satellites of \u2022 \nthe constellation: those ahead and behind in the same orbital plane   , and those to \nthe right and left in adjacent orbital planes       \n\n In the nominal attitude    mode, the satellites\u2019 primary attitude control    is achieved by \nthe gyroscopic stability    of a single pitch   -axis momentum wheel. A  fi ne Earth    horizon \nsensor, which is the primary attitude reference, detects the infrared    signature of the \nEarth\u2019s horizon. Pitch    errors are removed by commanding changes in wheel speed; \nroll    and yaw    errors are controlled by commanding torques    from two magneto-torqu-\ners    bars. The direction of the magnetic  fi eld is determined by a three-axis-magnetom-\neter. In the nominal attitude the pointing    accuracy    is 0.2\u00b0 in roll, 0.3\u00b0 in pitch and 0.4\u00b0 \nin yaw. Just after separation from the launchers, a three-axis gyro is used for attitude \nreference, a wide  fi eld-of-view low accuracy Earth sensor is used for initial Earth \nacquisition, and the hydrazine    thrusters    cited above are used to control the attitude. \nThis same arrangement of sensors is used for attitude control during orbital maneu-\nvering, including satellite in-orbit storage, orbit ascent, and descent. The satellite uses \na blow-down monopropellant    hydrazine subsystem    for all propulsive functions.   \n\n  Figure 9.28.     Iridium    66 Satellite Constellation.

Aims \n Pleiades    13  is a constellation of two Earth    observation    satellites that provide images of \nvery high spatial resolution    in  fi ve bands: wide-band panchromatic   ; blue; green; red \nand near-infrared   . The images have a spatial resolution at Nadir    of 0.7 m. Each image \nprovides a  fi eld of view    of 20 km. The satellite is agile   , enabling rapid pointing    and \n fl exible image acquisition. With the two satellites in orbit the constellation provides \ndaily access across the globe. The mission is ideal for general cartography and for \ncritical military and civilian security needs. The program is led by CNES in coopera-\ntion with Sweden, Belgium, Spain, and Austria. The program began in 2001 and the \n fi rst satellite will be launched in 2010, with the second following a year later; the \ndesign lifetime is 5 years. Each satellite weighs 1,000 kg and the solar array    can \ngenerate up to 1,500 W of power.  \n\n    9.6.4.2.   Orbit \n Pleiades    (Figure  9.29 )  fl ies in a Sun-synchronous frozen orbit    with an altitude of 694 \nkm (Figure  9.30 ). The constellation\u2019s two satellites are phased at 180\u00b0 in an orbit of \n14 + 15/26 revolutions per day and a Sun-synchronous    inclination of 98.2. The local \ntime    of the ascending node    is 10:30. This orbit track affords daily access to any point \non Earth   . Each of the satellites possesses autonomous orbit determination    using a \nDoris    receiver, which can determine its position with an accuracy of around 1 m. The \nsatellites 14  control their orbit using a propulsion    subsystem    grouped in a module that \ncontains all the relevant equipment. The hydrazine    system is based on four 1 N thrust-\ners    and a tank    with 104 l of hydrazine. These thrusters are used for orbit control   , but \nnot for attitude control   .    \n\n  Figure 9.29.

Attitude \n In the nominal mode   , attitude determination    is performed by a gyro-stellar system, \nincluding gyroscopes providing angular velocity    and star trackers    providing angular \nposition   . Solid-state  fi ber optic gyroscopes are used to ensure highly accurate attitude \ndetermination while maneuvering. All attitude determination units feature optical \nheads located on the instrument structure, to minimize thermal distortion of the \ninstruments   \u2019 line of sight   . In line with the satellites\u2019 high agility   , the attitude control    \nsystem can determine the satellite\u2019s attitude from a \u201clost in space\u201d condition, and is \nable to recognize its initial attitude by distinguishing stellar patterns. Pleiades    is a \nvery high-resolution mission and its pointing    requirements    are correspondingly very \ndemanding. The satellite is able to properly locate images on-ground with an accu-\nracy of 10 m. At the 694 km altitude of the satellite this is equivalent to a pointing \nknowledge    of 14  m rad. In order to allow the fast repointing needed for optimal \nmaneuvering, Pleiades uses a cluster of four Control Moment Gyros    (CMGs) as atti-\ntude actuators. Each actuator provides a momentum of 15 Nms. Special guiding \ntechniques are used to avoid the usual drawbacks of CMGs; instead of following a \nprede fi ned attitude pro fi le that can lock the cluster in singularities, a cluster reorienta-\ntion is realized, taking into account the satellite\u2019s history and trajectory, in order to \nglobally optimize the system. This approach allows the use of the complete angular \nmomentum    capacity envelope, which is about 3.2 times the elementary CMG    \nmomentum, and results in simpli fi cation of GMG cluster management  fl ight soft-\nware   . Pleiades also has a safe mode   , called the \u201cAcquisition and Safe Hold\u201d mode, \nwhich is based on the use of variations in the Earth   \u2019s    magnetic  fi eld. In this mode the \nsatellite rotates at two revolutions per orbit around the axis perpendicular to the plane \nof the orbit. \n\n  Figure 9.30.     One Day of the Track of Both Pleiades    Satellites.       \n\n \n\n\n\n272 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n As noted above, Pleiades    is an agile satellite    able to maneuver along and across-track   . \nThis allows the creation of \u201cmosaics\u201d of individual 20 \u00d7 20 km images that together \nprovide large images up to 120 \u00d7 120 km. The satellite is able to point off-Nadir    up to \n\u00b143\u00b0, which permits revisits in less than 1 day (Section 9.9.4) over the entire Earth    with \na constellation of just two satellites. The satellite is compact, with the telescope    located \nat the center. It features a deployable solar array   , but the deployed panels are solidly \nattached to the spacecraft\u2019s body and have supplementary stiffening stringers. This mini-\nmizes inertia, maximizes stiffness,    and optimizes the agility    of the satellite. The satel-\nlite\u2019s powerful CMG    cluster allows it to turn 5\u00b0 in 8 s and 60\u00b0 in 25 s. Pleiades\u2019 agility \nallows its satellites to acquire up to 450 images per day.    \n\n    9.7.   Geometry around the satellite \n\n This section analyzes the geometry of the celestial sphere    around the satellite. The \nfollowing elements will be examined:\n\n   The Sun   . At 1 AU the angular size of the Sun is about half a degree. The Sun is \u2022 \nvisible only when not eclipsed by the Earth   .  \n  The Earth   . The angular size of the Earth depends on the orbit altitude   . In a LEO    \u2022 \norbit with an altitude of 800 km the angular size of the Earth is 125\u00b0; in a GEO    \norbit it is 17.4\u00b0.  \n  Deep space   , which occupies the remaining celestial sphere    centered on the \u2022 \nsatellite.  \n  For remote sensing    satellites, the direction of the observable    will de fi ne the point-\u2022 \ning    direction of the instruments   . The observable will be located over either the \nEarth    or deep space   .  \n  Ground stations    for communications located above the Earth   .    \u2022 \n\n The geometry around the satellite depends on the satellite\u2019s orbit and attitude. The \nattitude is the more signi fi cant of the two because it de fi nes the orientation of the \nbodies around the satellite, while the orbit de fi nes their angular size. The celestial \nsphere    geometry around the satellite strongly shapes its con fi guration   ; see Section   10.4     \nfor a detailed discussion of how the satellite con fi guration answers to the design con-\nstraints imposed by the geometry around the satellite. \n\n Section  9.3  listed  fi ve possible attitude strategies; Section  9.3.1  looked at uncon-\ntrolled satellites lacking a geometry that could be systematically analyzed; \nSection  9.3.2  examined gravity   -gradient    satellites and pointed out that from the point \nof view of geometry, they are Nadir   -pointing   . Their special geometry will be studied \nin this section. Section  9.3.3  analyzed stabilization by rotation; satellites stabilized by \nrotation    have their own speci fi c observing geometry and will also be analyzed in this \nsection. Section  9.3.5  divided inertially stabilized    satellites into three groups: Nadir-\npointed   , Agile,    and inertially pointed   . Nadir-pointed, inertially stabilized satellites \nhave the same geometry as Nadir-pointed gravity-gradient spacecraft, and they will \nbe discussed together. Agile satellites possess a widely variable geometry that shall \nbe analyzed separately, as will the special geometry of inertially stabilized satellites. \nSection  9.3.4  examined dual spin    and momentum bias    attitudes: the satellite\u2019s spin-\nning segment will have the geometry of a spinning satellite, while the nonspinning \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n273The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\nportion\u2019s geometry will be inertially pointed or Nadir-pointed. Thus, an exhaustive \nanalysis of the geometry surrounding a satellite will consider four distinct \nsituations:\n\n   Satellites pointed to Nadir     \u2022 \n  Spinning satellites  \u2022 \n  Satellites pointed in an inertial space     \u2022 \n  Agile    satellites    \u2022 \n\n These four categories will be covered in the following subsections. \n\n    9.7.1.   Nadir    pointing    \n\n    9.7.1.1.   General \n In Nadir   -pointing    satellites the direction of the Earth    is  fi xed with respect to the satel-\nlite, and the Earth is always in the Nadir direction. Almost always both the observ-\nable   , which de fi nes the orientation of the instruments   , and the ground stations   , which \ndetermine antenna orientation, will be located on the Earth.  \n\n The solid angle    occupied by the Earth    is a function of the satellite\u2019s altitude \n(Figure  9.31 ). At very low altitude, the Earth dominates almost half the celestial sphere    \naround the satellite, and higher orbits correspond to smaller solid Earth angles. At the \nmost frequently employed altitude, around 800 km, the Earth occupies about 1/3 of the \ncelestial sphere. In GEO    the Earth occupies a solid angle with a diameter of 17.4\u00b0. The \nsolid angle occupied by the Sun   , on the other hand, is equal to half a degree and can \nbe considered constant for all seasons and for all orbit altitudes    around the Earth. \n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n100 1000\n\nN\nor\n\nm\nal\n\n L\nE\n\nO\n a\n\nlti\ntu\n\nde\n r\n\nan\nge\n\nN\nor\n\nm\nal\n\n M\nE\n\nO\n a\n\nlti\ntu\n\nde\n r\n\nan\nge\n\nG\nE\n\nO\n a\n\nlti\ntu\n\nde\n\n10000 100000\n\n  Figure 9.31.     Earth    Solid Radius Angle in Degrees as a Function of Satellite Altitude in \nKilometer.       \n\n \n\n\n\n274 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n The Sun   /orbit geometry depends on the orbit inclination    and on the direction of \nthe Earth-Sun vector    (Figure  9.32 ). The Earth-Sun vector moves with the seasons but \nis always in the ecliptic plane   , but the orbit inclination is  fi xed with respect to the \nequatorial plane    and the ecliptic and equatorial planes make an angle of 23.4\u00b0. That \nmeans the Sun/orbit geometry will change with the seasons as the Sun/orbit direction \nmoves up and down 23.4\u00b0 with respect to the orbital plane   . The Sun/orbit geometry \nis de fi ned by the angle between the Sun direction and the normal to the orbit direction \n(Figure  9.32 ), termed the  b  ? angle. In Nadir   -pointing    attitude the satellite rotates \nonce per orbit with respect to inertial space   , and the Sun likewise rotates around the \nsatellite once per orbit in a satellite- fi xed reference frame. That means the Sun \ndescribes a cone around the satellite during each orbit (Figure  9.33 ). The axis of the \ncone is the vector normal to the orbital plane   , and the cone angle    is the  b -angle, which \nchanges with the seasons; the cone is wide open when the Sun is near the orbital plane \nand more acute when the Sun is near the perpendicular to the orbital plane. When the \nSun is nearly perpendicular to the orbital plane, its direction will be almost constant \nalong the orbit, and when the Sun lies in the orbital plane, its direction will revolve \naround the satellite.   \n\n When the solid angle    occupied by the Earth    is larger than the angular distance of \nthe Sun    to the Nadir    axis, the Earth will eclipse    the Sun. When the Sun is nearly \nperpendicular to the orbital plane    the cone angle    will be very acute, and the Sun will \nalways be far away from the Nadir direction, and the orbit will experience no eclipse. \nWhen the Sun lies in the orbital plane, eclipse time will be maximized and propor-\ntional to the part of the celestial sphere    occupied by the Earth. At normal LEO    alti-\ntudes the Earth\u2019s solid radius is around 60\u00b0 (Figure  9.31 ) and the maximum eclipse \nwill be about 1/3 of the orbital period   . \n\n This means that the Sun   \u2019s geometry with respect to a Nadir-pointed    satellite \nchanges along the orbit, describing a cone, and changes with the seasons that change \nthe  b  cone angle   . This de fi nes a widely variable geometry that will have a heavy \nimpact on the satellite\u2019s con fi guration    because the Sun\u2019s direction determines the \nlocation of the solar arrays   , thermal radiators, and instruments   . The speed with which \nthe  b -angle changes will be the rotational speed of the Satellite-Sun direction with \n\n  Figure 9.32.

In inertial space   , the Earth-Sun direction rotates once per \nyear, and the orbital plane rotation speed is a function of the gravity    anomalous J2    \nparameter (Section  9.2.1 ), the orbital inclination and the orbit altitude    and eccentric-\nity   . For near circular orbits at a typical altitude around 800 km, this differential speed \n(Figure  9.34 ) varies from a maximum of one turn every 47.5 days for equatorial \norbits, to one turn per year at 90\u00b0 inclinations (where the orbital plane is  fi xed in the \ninertial space), to a maximum of in fi nite duration for Sun-synchronous    inclinations \n(Section  9.4.2 ) around 98\u00b0.  \n\n In order to fully understand the Earth    and Sun    geometry around a Nadir-pointing    \nsatellite, distinct Sun-Earth-satellite geometries, which are a function of the orbit \ninclination    and altitude, must be thoroughly examined. Various scenarios will be \nanalyzed in the next paragraphs.  \n\n    9.7.1.2.   Sun-synchronous    orbits \n Sun-synchr   onous orbits (Figure  9.35 ) were introduced in 9.4.2. That section described \ntheir main characteristics and their advantages for Earth observation   . One of the \nadvantages was that they have fairly constant Sun-orbit geometries. The geometry of \nSun-synchronous    orbits is not exactly constant: \n\n   Throughout the seasons the Sun    moves up and down the orbital plane    due to the \u2022 \nangle of 23.4\u00b0 between the Ecliptic    and Equatorial planes.  \n  Sun-synchronous    orbit    inclination is between 97\u00b0 and 99\u00b0 \u2013 depending of the alti-\u2022 \ntude \u2013 and the excess over 90\u00b0 will combine with the previous 23.4\u00b0.    \n\n Throughout the seasons the Sun    cone angle     b  oscillates. The oscillation will \ndepend of the vector addition of the 23.4\u00b0 and the 7\u20139\u00b0 indicated above. This vector \naddition will be function of the local time    of the descending node    (Section  9.4 ), which \n\n  Figure 9.33.

Therefore, it is necessary to \nanalyze the different situations for different orbital local times   . Figures  9.36  and  9.37  \nprovide the geometry for two local times 10:00 and 18:00.   \n\n In Sun-synchr   onous orbits with a local time    not far away from 12:00 \u2013 like the \n10:00 orbit of Sentinel-3    \u2013 the Sun is never too far away from the orbital plane   . If the \nlocal time is 18:00 the Sun is never far away from the normal to the orbital plane   . \nFigure  9.37  depicts the geometry in both cases. The seasonal variations of eclipse    \nduration for these two orbits can be seen in Figure  9.38 . The eclipse duration experi-\nenced by the satellite for the 10:00 orbit is fairly constant along the year and lasts \naround 33 min; equivalent to one third of the orbit. Sun-synchronous    satellites need-\ning to minimize eclipse duration must  fl y with a 6:00 h angle with the Sun always \nclose to the perpendicular to the orbit. At 800 km of altitude, the 06:00 orbit is \neclipse-free except for a period of around 80 days near the summer solstice when \neclipses    lasts up to 15 min.   \n\n    9.7.1.3.   High inclination non-Sun-synchronous    orbits \n In non-Sun-synchr   onous orbits, the Sun rotates around the orbital plane   .

This makes the \nthermal design    more complex. The eclipse    duration will vary from 1/3 of the orbital \nperiod    when the Sun is near the orbital plane, to no eclipse when the Sun is near the \nperpendicular to the orbital plane (Figure  9.39 ).  \n\n In most situations the satellite will have faces that should always be illuminated \nby the Sun    and faces that should totally avoid solar illumination; nevertheless, as the \nSun rotates around the orbital plane   , it will pass from illuminating one side of the \nsatellite to illuminating the other. If the satellite was rotated around its yaw   -axis by \n180\u00b0 when the Sun passes through the orbital plane, the leading face becomes the \ntrailing face and vice versa, and the face that was not Sun illuminated continues to \navoid direct solar illumination. The observing geometry of Nadir   -looking instruments    \nwill also not be altered. This maneuver (Figure  9.40 ), which is called yaw- fl ip   , shall \nbe repeated every time the Sun transverses the orbital plane and it is common in \nNadir   -pointing    satellites that do not  fl y Sun-Synchronous    orbits and that need a face \nof the satellite always avoiding the Sun.   \n\n    9.7.1.4.   Low inclination    orbits \n As the orbit inclination    becomes smaller the area of possible Sun    illumination is cor-\nrespondingly reduced. In case the inclination was zero the maximum Sun to orbital \nplane    angle will be 23.4\u00b0 in the equinoxes    and 0\u00b0 in the solstices (Figure  9.41 ).  \n\n In this case, the Sun    will never be too far from the orbital plane    and each orbit it \nwill describe a shallow cone around the satellite, progressively illuminating the wake   , \n\n  Figure 9.37.

Geostationary orbits \n A special example of a low inclination orbit    is the geostationary one (Section  9.4.4 ). \nIn geostationary orbits   , the Sun    will be located in the northern hemisphere during half \nthe year and in the southern hemisphere during the other half. If the satellite makes a \nyaw- fl ip    maneuver at both equinoxes   , the North Pole and the South Pole faces  fl ip. \nThis ensures that one face will always be protected from direct sunlight, which is \ncrucial for improving thermal control    of the satellite and its instruments   . \n\n The solid    angle radius of the Earth    from the geostationary orbit    is 8.7\u00b0. The satel-\nlite is in the equatorial plane    and the Sun   , which is in the ecliptic plane   , will shift up \nand down by 23.4\u00b0 with the seasons with respect to the orbital plane   . This means that \nGEO    orbits are eclipses   -free for most of the year. Nevertheless, during the periods \naround both equinoxes    the Sun will be close to the equatorial plane, and when the \nangle of the Sun above the orbital plane is below 8.7\u00b0, eclipses will occur. These \neclipses will be longest during the equinoxes; lasting up to 69.4 min. GEO satellites \nmust be able to cope with these long eclipses. When the Sun is near Earth but not yet \nhidden by it, the satellite\u2019s Nadir    facing side will receive direct sunlight (Figure  9.43 ). \nThis can be detrimental to the satellite\u2019s instruments    or payload, which will require \nprotective shutters, and the instruments will be inoperative when the shutters are \nclosed.    \n\n    9.7.2.   Rotating satellites \n\n Compared with the complex geometry of Nadir   -pointed satellites, the geometry of \nrotating satellites is simple. The positions of the Earth   , the Sun   , the observable,    and \nthe deep space    in the satellite-centered celestial sphere    are de fi ned by the satellite\u2019s \nrotation axis   , and the rotation axis is  fi xed in inertial space   . If the rotation axis is \npointed perpendicular to either the ecliptic or the equatorial plane   , the satellite will \n\nEclipse duration min for a 10 deg inclined orbit at 800km\nand RAAN = 45 deg at equinox\n\n31\n\n31.5\n\n32\n\n32.5\n\n33\n\n33.5\n\n34\n\n34.5\n\n35\n\n35.5\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n\nTime in day from the beginning of the year\n\nE\ncl\n\nip\nse\n\n t\nim\n\ne \nin\n\n m\nin\n\n  Figure 9.42.

The satellite\u2019s rotation speed \u2013 and \nhence the Sun\u2019s rotation speed relative to it\u2014is normally rapid enough to render \nsunlight and thermal conditions uniform on all the lateral surfaces. Thus, the lateral \nsurfaces are the logical place for locating solar cells   , and the top and bottom faces for \nradiating the satellite\u2019s thermal waste energy. The Cluster    (Figure   10.3    ) constellation \nof four satellites (Figure  9.21 ) is an example of this kind of con fi guration   . The satel-\nlite features a cylindrical symmetry   , with the top and bottom faces used for waste heat \nradiation and the cylindrical sides for solar cells. This type of geometry and the result-\ning con fi guration is common in satellites used to study the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere   . \nSection   7.1.3     already commented the special con fi guration of rotating satellite and \nFigure   7.3     provided the con fi guration of MSG   . Ulysses    (Section  9.6.2 ) has its own \nradio-isotopic power source and has no need to point the solar cells toward the Sun. \nIn Ulysses the spin direction is pointed toward Earth to allow communications via the \nlarge-gain antenna located on the Earth-pointed    face.  \n\n    9.7.3.   Inertial satellites \n\n Inertial satellites point toward the celestial sphere    and are almost without exception \nastronomical observatories. Their instruments    have no need to point toward Earth   , \npermitting more freedom in the selection of attitude. In the case of inertially stabi-\nlized satellites, the celestial sphere does not rotate around the satellite once per orbit \nas it does for Nadir   -pointed satellites. For inertial satellites,    the changes in geometry \nare seasonal and slow. Because of the Sun   \u2019s intense radiation, pointing    either \ndirectly at it or within a large cone around the solar vector must be avoided. The \norbital plane    will rotate seasonally with respect to the Sun, which de fi nes a situation \nwhere some areas of the sky are accessible in some seasons and inaccessible in oth-\ners. One way to protect the telescope    from solar radiation is to have it pointing \nperpendicular to the Sun, and target observables    by rotating the satellite around the \nSun axis, allowing the telescope to scan a belt perpendicular to this rotation axis   . \n\n  Figure 9.43.

If the satellite is orbiting the \nEarth however, the Earth will rotate around the satellite once per orbit blinding \nchanging areas of the spacecraft as the Earth rotates, and the pointing and operations \nof the satellite shall take this into account. Hubble    (Section   7.2    ) is one example of \nan inertially stabilized    astronomical observatories  fl ying in LEO   . In the case of \nHubble, which has an orbital inclination of 28\u00b0, it takes 8 weeks for the celestial \nsphere to rotate around the orbital plane. The CNES mission Corot is another exam-\nple. Corot has an orbit inclination    of 90\u00b0 takes 1 year. In both cases users would have \npreferred higher orbits and more  fl exible pointing possibilities, but Hubble was \nforced into its orbit by the need for astronaut servicing, and Corot due to budget \nconstraints. To reduce the Earth\u2019s occultation period requires orbiting at high alti-\ntudes, where the angular size of the Earth will be smaller. Most of the missions \ndiscussed in Section   7.2     \u2013 IUE   , XMM, and ISO    \u2013 orbit far above Earth.   \n\n    9.8.   Pointing control, pointing perturbations, and pointing \ncorrections \n\n The two subsections of this section analyze the interrelations between: satellite atti-\ntude control   , instruments    pointing   , instruments data acquisition quality, and pointing \nperturbations   . That means, this section will analyze pointing as an end-to-end issue   . \nThis book concentrates on the analysis of interrelations between space systems com-\nponents. Instrument pointing is perhaps the richest area in interactions and Section \n  7.2.3     and Figure   7.13     already selected this area to illustrate cascades of complex \ninteracting requirements and design decisions. \n\n The needs for data quality will drive the requirements    on pointing   . As a result of \nconsumer   \u2019s needs, it will be necessary to create budgets    on: absolute pointing   , pointing \nknowledge   , pointing stability   , pointing stability knowledge   , geo-location,    and co-regis-\ntration    (Section  9.10 ). In case where there was a very strict requirement on pointing and \nseveral sources of mechanical disturbances   , it will be also necessary to create an inde-\npendent budget on mechanical disturbances. The apportioning of these budgets will \ngenerate requirements all over the space system: satellite, instrument, and ground pro-\ncessing. Furthermore the interrelations related to pointing are especially complex:\n\n   There is the need to differentiate between probabilistic    and nonprobabilistic \u2022 \nerrors.  \n  There is the need to differentiate the behavior of the different errors in the fre-\u2022 \nquency domain.  \n  There is the need to differentiate between errors that can be estimated, errors that \u2022 \ncan be calibrated and corrected and errors that cannot be estimated or corrected.    \n\n The handling of pointing    is in the hands of the attitude control    specialist. \nNevertheless, the system level implications of pointing single it out as an area of \nspecial interest for the system architect   . In line with this complexity, and in line with \nthe need for the architect to understand this complexity, this section and their subsec-\ntions are correspondingly thorough. The approach used by this chapter follows the \napproaches developed in ESA and the European space industry during many years. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n284 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nThis approach was started in the 1990s by the \u201cESA pointing handbook\u201d 15  and is now \nconsolidated in the \u201cControl Performance\u201d ECSS   -E-ST-60-10 document. 16  \n\n    9.8.1.   Satellite and instruments pointing and pointing perturbations \n\n The payload justi fi es the mission. The correct understanding of satellite attitude    shall \nbe in terms of the quality of the pointing    of its payload:\n\n   The satellite shall point the payload toward the intended target. This requires the \u2022 \nattitude of the satellite and the pointing    direction of the payload to be correct. This \nwill de fi ne an Absolute Pointing Error    requirement (APE    in Figure  9.44 ).   \n  Imaging instruments    produce data by integrating the radiation received by the \u2022 \nfocal array detectors during a given interval of time ( D  t  in Figure  9.44 ). During \nthis integration interval    the satellite must remain stable to avoid smearing    the sig-\nnal reaching the satellite from a single direction across different detector pixels. \nThis de fi nes a requirement on Relative Pointing Error    (RPE    in Figure  9.44 ). RPE \nis de fi ned within the instrument\u2019s integration time     D  t . RPE will specify limits to \nthe satellite and instrument attitude change rates.  \n  The satellite shall be able to provide information allowing the correct identi fi cation \u2022 \nof the direction of the signal detected by the payload. That means, to correctly \nlocate the source of the signal. This requires the attitude of the satellite to be cor-\nrectly known. This will generate requirements    on the knowledge of the attitude \n\u201cAbsolute Knowledge Error   \u201d (AKE   ) and \u201cRelative Knowledge Error   \u201d (RKE   ). \nRKE is also relative within the instrument integration time     D  t  and it speci fi es the \nknowledge of attitude change rates.    \n\n  Figure 9.44.     During the Instrument Integration Interval     D  t , the Mean Pointing    Error (MPE   ) \nCombines with the Relative Pointing Error (RPE   ) to Provide the Instantaneous \nAbsolute Pointing Error (APE   ).       \n\n   15   ESA Pointing    Handbook, TIDC-CR-5522 February 1993.  \n   16   Space Engineering Control Performance, ECSS   -E-ST-60-10, 2008.  \n\n \n\n\n\n285The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n Therefore the satellite and their instruments    must be pointing    in the right direction, \nthis direction shall be known, and the pointing direction rate of change shall be small \nand known. \n\n The determination of the alignment between satellite attitude    and instrument line \nof sight    can be estimated by the help of specialized analysis \u2013 for example ther-\nmoelastic deformations    analysis \u2013 and by comparing the attitude information pro-\nvided by the satellite\u2019s attitude determination    devices with the true line of sight of the \ninstruments    as determined by the location in the images of points, like rivers or stars, \nwhose location is very well known. This will allow characterizing and correcting \nmisalignments    between the satellite attitude \u2013 as de fi ned by the attitude sensing \ndevices \u2013 and the instrument\u2019s line of sight.

The mission\u2019s  fi nal products \nneed to be correctly located to their source above the Earth    or in the celestial sphere   , \nand that observations gathered from the same locations must be co-registered together \nas such. This will generate geo-localization    and co-registration    requirements    and \nbudgets   . This means that attitude control system generates numerous and interrelated \nbudgets that need to be controlled and allocated. To know and to control the exact \npointing of the instruments it is also necessary to know and control not only the satel-\nlite attitude but also the satellite position in the orbit. The resulting requirements will \nspecify the on-ground and in-orbit satellite position and velocity sensors; the accu-\nracy of the orbit determination    algorithms and the orbit control    strategy.   \n\n    9.8.2.   Pointing control, pointing perturbing torques, image acquisition, \nand frequency ranges \n\n The perturbing internal forces    and torques    will change the satellite attitude    and \n attitude rates. These perturbations will be fought by the satellite attitude control    sub-\nsystem   . The attitude control subsystem shall ensure that the satellite points in the \nright direction and that the line of sight    of the instruments    is stable during the interval \n D  t  when the instruments are integrating information over the observable   . The mea-\nsurements and control capabilities of the attitude control, the integration interval    of \nthe instrument and the internal sources of perturbations can be characterized and \ngrouped with respect to their frequency:\n\n   The attitude control    determination devices will be able to detect only actual point-\u2022 \ning    variations that are slower that a given limit. That means there is an upper limit \nto the attitude sensing frequency.  \n  The attitude control    actuators and control loop will need time to react to the \u2022 \ndetected pointing    variations. This will establish an upper limit in the control of the \nattitude.  \n  The perturbations acting over the pointing    could be slow acting, fast acting, or \u2022 \neven instantaneous jumps. Internal vibrations    of the satellite could enhance or \nreduce perturbations depending of their frequency.  \n  To provide adequate radiometric quality    (Section  \u2022  8.4.2    ) the signal arriving to the \ninstruments    shall be integrated during a speci fi ed period of time  D  t  (Figure  9.44 ). \nThis interval will also de fi ne an associated instrument related frequency.    \n\n The different time and frequency features of the attitude control    system, the per-\nturbations, and the period of time  D  t  of the instruments    will make them to interact in \ncomplex ways that shall be studied in a systematic fashion. An overall perspective of \nthe frequency domain interaction of pointing    perturbations    and pointing control in a \nsatellite can be seen in Figure  9.46 . A perturbation of constant strength    and increasing \nfrequency produces decreasing attitude disturbances because a force needs time to \nproduce attitude change and increasing frequencies provide shorter and shorter times \nfor the forces to produce changes in attitude. This explains the downward slope of the \ncurve that provides the \u201ctransfer function\u201d relationship between a disturbing force/\ntorque and the resulting disturbance in attitude.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n287The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n Some perturbations will be at a very speci fi c frequency. This will be the case of \nthe resonances of the solar array    or other satellite structures   , or from harmonic per-\nturbations    associated with rotating elements like pointing    mirrors   , antennae, or rotat-\ning attitude control actuators   . An especially dangerous situation will develop if a \nharmonic perturbation was in resonance with the resonance mode of some satellite \nstructure. Other perturbations will be wide frequency \u201cmechanical noises   .\u201d This will \nbe the case of bearings or mechanical cryo-coolers. The activation of mechanical \nactuators will also produce wide-bandwidth    high frequency noises produce by \nmechanical jolts. The design of the AOCS could limit itself to a conventional low \nfrequency bandwidth or it could try to control some of the higher frequency perturba-\ntions as produced by the solar array drive bending or by the rotation of any large size \nantenna. The instrument integration time    can also be adjusted to make it higher or \nlower frequency. Lower frequencies will be associated to longer integration times and \nbetter signal to noise ratio (Sections   8.4.2     and   8.7.1    ) but lower frequencies will make \nmore dif fi cult the design of the rest of the satellite because it will be required to main-\ntain the instrument line of sight    stability during longer times. \n\n Comparing the frequencies associated with the perturbations, attitude control    sys-\ntem, and instrument integration interval    three situations are possible:\n\n    (a)     Low frequency line of sight    \u201cdrift   \u201d perturbations whose frequency is lower than \nthe frequency of the attitude control    system and lower than the frequency associ-\nated with the instrument integration time     D  t ; lower frequency curve of Figure  9.47a . \n\nT\nransfer F\n\nunction =\n A\n\nttitude disturbance / T\norque disturbance \n\nRange of the instrument sampling frequency = 1/! t\n\nFrequency (Hz)\n\n0 dB\n\nExternal\ntorques and\n\nforces:\naerodynamic,\n\ngravity\ngradient, solar\n\npressure,\nsolar heating\n\nConventional\nAOCS\n\nbandwidth\n\n1001010.10.01\n\nPossible active damping of disturbances at satellite or\ninstrument levels\n\nLarger\nantennae\nscanning\n\nand\nresonance\n\nmodes\nGlobal\n\nstructural\nresonance\n\nmodes Local\nstructural\n\nresonance\nmodes\n\nCryo-Coolers\n\nRotary attitude control actuators: harmonic and random perturbations\n\nSolar array drive mechanisms: harmonic and random perturbations\n\nScanning mechanisms: harmonic and random perturbations\n\nSolar array\nbending\nmodes \n\nPossible passive damping\nof disturbances \n\n  Figure 9.46.

To reduce the complication of the attitude control \n system, it will also be necessary to limit the magnitude of these slow frequency \nperturbations. Slow movements generated by vibrations    of a very large \u2013 and \nunavoidably  fl exible \u2013 solar array    would be a perturbation of this type.   \n\n    (b)     Perturbations of frequency higher that the upper limit of the bandwidth    of the \nattitude control    system but lower than the frequency associated with the instru-\nment integration time     D  t . (higher frequency curve of Figure  9.47a ). To control \nthese perturbations, it will be necessary to specify the maximum line of sight    \nstability value RPE   / D  t  that these perturbations will produce. Medium velocity \nscanning devices   , for example large scanning mirrors or antennae, will generate \nthis type of perturbation.  \n\n    (c)     Perturbations faster than the integration time    of the instrument. To limit their \neffect, the amplitude of these \u201cjitter   \u201d perturbations shall be speci fi ed (Figure  9.47b ). \nThis will require specifying the maximum jitter amplitude value  D  q . Medium and \nhigh velocity mechanical devices, like momentum wheels    or fast scanning devices   , \nwill produce this type of perturbation. High frequency noise sources of any type \nwill also produce perturbations of this type. As frequency goes up, increasing \nforces will be needed to produce the same attitude change amplitude  D  q . That \nmeans very high frequency perturbations shall be very strong to have a noticeable \n\n  Figure 9.47.

The decreasing slope of the transfer function line of the \nFigure  9.46  has already depicted this.     \n\n To reduce the instrument integration time     D  t  makes easier the task of the attitude \ncontrol   . If a long  D  t  was absolute necessary, it could be possible to acquire many \nindependent fast images of the observable    that could be superimpose together until \nthe necessary long integrated time is reached. To superimpose these images it is nec-\nessary to have data on the actual pointing    of the satellite when each image was \nacquired. This will change the situation from (b) to (c) relaxing the requirement on \nthe RPE    but the requirements    on attitude knowledge could still be very demanding. \nThis approach will also reduce the amount of images produced by the mission and \ncomplicate the processing of the data produced by the instruments   . \n\n Operating mechanisms    produce perturbing forces and torques   . Attitude control \nmechanisms like momentum wheels    or control momentum gyros    will also inevitably \nproduce perturbing forces and torques when operating, and it is necessary to specify the \nallowable perturbing forces and torques produced by the different attitude control    actua-\ntors. In general, space mechanisms are meticulously designed and smooth running and \nproduce low levels of disturbance; nevertheless, these perturbations become design \ndrivers when the instrument has very demanding pointing    or pointing stability    require-\nments    or when the satellite has very large rotating devices. Any Earth-observing instru-\nment    providing meter-level accuracy from low Earth orbit    will require strict control of \nperturbing torques. The same will apply to high angular resolution space telescopes for \nastronomy. Limiting perturbations requires that all rotating masses are well balanced \nand that rotation bearings and actuators run smoothly. In the case of high frequency \nperturbations, it should be taken into account that they are locally produced and they \nreduce in intensity \u2013 are damped \u2013 as they travel along the satellite structure; mounting \nthe perturbation sources on active or passive dampers can reduce these perturbations. \n\n Perturbations produced by very large rotating structures   , such as MeghaTropiques   \u2019 \nmicrowave instrument (depicted in Figures   8.9     and   8.21    ) represent a special case. \nThis instrument produces a perturbation peak at the rotation frequency, which might \nbe within the control bandwidth    of the attitude control    system. In that case the attitude \ncontrol will try to compensate for the disturbances. At any rate, all large rotating \ncomponents need to be well balanced, and in some cases can incorporate in-orbit \nactuators for in- fl ight balancing. This would complicate the design of the instrument, \nbut the design of the attitude control system would be correspondingly easier.  \n\n    9.8.3.   Pointing error types \n\n In order to specify requirements    based on an analysis of the errors acting on an instru-\nments   \u2019 line of sight   , it is necessary to understand their types. Errors can be divided \naccording to different classi fi cation criteria:\n\n   By being deterministic    or probabilistic   :\u2022 \n   The behavior of deterministic    errors can be predicted or estimated to some  \u2013\nextent. These estimations can be incorporated into the error descriptions.  \n  The speci fi c time histories of probabilistic    errors cannot be predicted but their  \u2013\nbehavior can be de fi ned in a statistical manner, ideally in terms of power spec-\ntral density   , mean,    and variance    (Section   5.8.4    ).     \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\n\n\n290 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  By frequency behavior:\u2022 \n   They can be constant.   \u2013\n  They can be very slow varying drifts.   \u2013\n  They can be harmonic perturbations    at speci fi c frequencies. Of special impor- \u2013\ntance are the orbital frequency and the frequencies associated with scanning \nmechanisms   .  \n  They can be \u201cbroad band,\u201d jitter    like noises.      \u2013\n\n  By the possibilities for corrections:\u2022 \n\n   Some might be calibrated, characterized, and \u2013 partially \u2013 corrected by ground  \u2013\nprocessing.  \n  Some might not be correctable.        \u2013\n\n The ESA and ECSS    guidelines mentioned at the beginning of Section  9.8  divide \nerrors into the following four types:\n\n   Bias errors   . These errors are related to permanent once-off (zero frequency) \u2022 \nevents. Permanent misalignments produced by assembly errors or by launch \nloads    are examples. These errors are probabilistic   . These errors can be mea-\nsured and partially compensated for by in-orbit characterization of the satel-\nlite after launch.  \n  Drift errors   . These are very slowly changing errors. The gradual change in align-\u2022 \nments produced by the evaporation of water vapor from a carbon  fi ber structure is \nan example. These errors are deterministic    and can be analyzed; the analysis can \nbe further validated by periodic in-orbit characterization of the evolution of the \neffects. To the degree that they are either predictable or measurable, these errors \ncan be also corrected.  \n  Harmonic errors   . These errors act at very speci fi c frequencies, For example, the \u2022 \nchanging thermal environment around a satellite while orbiting will produce vari-\nable thermoelastic deformations    at the orbital frequency. This error is determinis-\ntic   , and can also be measured and corrected by analysis, testing, and by \ncharacterization of the satellite at the beginning of its life. The already mentioned \nslow vibrations    of a large solar array    or the rotation of a large unbalanced mechan-\nical device will be also harmonic.  \n  Noise errors   . There are many error sources that behave like high frequency broad-\u2022 \nband jitters. From a probabilistic    point of view they are Gaussian noises. The \nread-out accuracy of sensors or the high frequency torque noise produced by ball \nbearings are of this type.    \n\n This classi fi cation is crucial because it will de fi ne how individual error sources \nadd together. Probabilistic errors are not directly added, but instead add the root \nmean square    of their corresponding standard deviations   ; that is, two errors with a \nstandard deviation of 1 will combine to produce a standard deviation of 1.41. \nCorrelated deterministic    errors, on the other hand, are added directly when they \nare originated by the same cause; for example thermoelastic misalignments \n produced by temperature variations. Uncorrelated deterministic errors should also \nroot mean square added. \n\n\n\n291The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n As said above deterministic    errors can be calculated and \u2013 as far as the calculation \nmethod is validated \u2013 they can be compensated. Bias error can also be determined by \nin-orbit characterization of the satellite. This will be further analyzed in Section  9.10.4 .   \n\n    9.9.   Allocation of functions \n\n    9.9.1.   Orbit selection \n Chapter   7     introduced space mission design; and Section   7.2     analyzed the fundamental \ndesign decisions involved in astronomical observatory    missions   . That analysis dem-\nonstrated that the selection of the mission orbit    is the highest-level decision made in \nthe earliest stages of the design process   , and shall be based on a thorough consider-\nation of all aspects of the mission. The varied orbits utilized by the astronomical \nobservatories described in Section   7.2     \u2013 LEO    for Hubble   , Geosynchronous    for IUE    \nand ISO   , highly elliptic    long period for XMM and Lagrangian    for Herschel    and \nJWST    \u2013 were driven by the need for long, unencumbered periods of observation and \nef fi cient operations and were constrained by the limitations provided by launchers \nand by the level of autonomy    allowed by technology. Section  9.4  offered an introduc-\ntion to the most common orbits and their typical uses, and provided a detailed over-\nview of the criteria driving orbit selection. \n\n Some missions call for the lowest possible orbit altitudes   ; Aeolus    (Section   8.3.1    ) \nis a good example of this. Simpli fi cation in the instrument design favored a low \nAeolus orbit, which complicated the satellite\u2019s orbit maintenance    components, and \nthe  fi nal orbit altitude    choice was the result of tensions between the laser power, the \ntelescope aperture   , the mission life,    and the amount of fuel to be carried on board. \nGOCE    (Section   10.3.1    ) orbits at an altitude of 250 km. This altitude resulted from a \ncompromise between the need of measuring weak gravity    signals as near to Earth   \u2019s \nsurface as possible and the need to provide increasing amounts of energy for the ion \npropulsion    as the orbit altitude decreased. \n\n In the case of remote sensing    missions, the orbit altitude   , inclination, and orbit \nrepeat patterns are also a compromise between con fl icting needs. Sentinel-3    \n(Section  9.6.1 ) could have  fl own with the same instruments    at a lower altitude, thus \naffording higher spatial resolutions, but to provide the same coverage it would have \nbeen necessary to use either a large number of satellites or wider  fi eld-of-view    instru-\nments which would have provided the same swath at a lower altitude, but the wider \n fi eld of view would have produced degraded image quality and distorted spatial reso-\nlution    near the edges of the image (Section   8.4.3    ). The  fi nal result of this trade-off    \nwas that an 800 km orbit was selected. Pleiades    (Section  9.6.4 ) has an instantaneous \nobservation area of 20 \u00d7 20 km, and its main mission driver was its very high 0.7 m \nspatial resolution, favored by lower  fl ying altitudes. But Pleiades must also have \naccess to any part of the Earth    within 1 day, which demanded off-Nadir    pointing    with \nlarge angles that would have to become even larger if  fl ying at lower altitudes. \n\n Sentinel-3    orbits with a local time    of 10:00.

Data from the radar altimeters would be more \naccurate with each satellite  fl ying at different local times, yielding better ocean time \nsampling. Climate studies, however, demand a long and consistent series of data and \ncontinuity with respect to previous missions is crucial. Various ESA satellite missions \nhave  fl own near 10:00, including ERS-1, ERS-2, and Envisat. The  fi nal orbit selec-\ntion was again a balance between con fl icting needs. \n\n The Iridium    (Section  9.6.3 ) constellation\u2019s orbit and orbit altitudes    were gov-\nerned by the need to provide contact anytime anywhere with mobile telephones. The \nchosen low altitude of 780 km offers short distances to the ground-based low-power, \nportable telephones, without the need for excessively large or powerful satellite \nantennas. Nevertheless, for complete Earth    coverage at all times a constellation of \n66 satellites, distributed in 6 orbital planes    in near-polar orbits, was necessary. \nThuraya 17  is another constellation that like Iridium provides mobile communications    \nto hand-held telephones, but it is not a global system and  fl ies in geostationary orbit   . \nTo compensate for the great distance, the satellites carry a powerful communication \nsystem, which depends on a large 12.5 m diameter deployable antenna. This antenna \noffers satisfactory communications to the telephones from the 35,786 km of the \ngeostationary orbit   , but only provides service to areas covered by the satellites, one \nlocated over 44\u00b0 East and the other over 98.5\u00b0 East. This is allowed by the fact that \nThuraya does not specify whole Earth coverage because of its specialized on \n communication for Asia. As with the widely different orbits of the astronomical \nobservatory    missions    reviewed in Section   7.2    , these examples underscore the fact \nthat similar, albeit not identical services can be provided through the use of very \ndifferent orbit architectures. \n\n The orbits of missions carrying in situ    instruments    are directly determined by \n having to travel through the areas being studied. Ulysses    is one such mission \n(Section  9.6.2 ), studying the solar environment at high latitudes    by  fl ying through \nthem with in situ instruments. The Cluster    constellation\u2019s orbit (Figure  9.21 ) and \nseparation between satellites are driven by the need to sample the different regions of \nthe Earth\u2019s    magnetosphere   ; the 90\u00b0 orbit inclination    provides a full selection of lati-\ntudes, a  fi xed orbital plane    affords shifting Sun-Earth geometries    throughout the year \nand the high eccentricity    offers a varied selection of distances to Earth. Rosetta   \u2019s orbit \n(Section   11.4.2    ), like that of Ulysses, is interplanetary and makes use of planetary \nrendezvous   . The choice of orbit was governed by the mission\u2019s aim of meeting the \ntargeted comet, which required high amounts of impulse for the satellite. The  fi nal \ntrajectory resulted from a compromise between the complications of providing pow-\nerful on-board propulsion    and the dif fi culties involved in performing multiple plan-\netary rendezvous   , which simpli fi es the hardware but complicates the satellite\u2019s \noperations and prolongs the mission. It should not be forgotten that orbit selection \nstrongly depends on the availability of launchers, frequently a system constraint    in \nwhich the architect    has little freedom of choice. Ulysses was made possible by its \nvery special launching conditions, which included use of the Space Shuttle, plus two \nsupplementary stages. This implementation would have been impossible if the \n mission were not collaboration between NASA and ESA.  \n\n   17     http://www.thuraya.com      \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://www.thuraya.com\n\n\n293The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n    9.9.2.   Attitude selection \n Attitudes were introduced in Section  9.3 , which analyzed the use of different types \nof attitude control    and the reasoning behind speci fi c choices of various missions. \nThat section recalled the different tools used for different types of attitude control, \nincluding uncontrolled; gravity-gradient   ; rotation-stabilized; momentum-biased; \ninertially stabilized    Nadir-pointed   ; and inertially stabilized inertially pointed   . \nSection  9.5  underscored the fact that most missions need more than one attitude \ncontrol loop: one complex high-accuracy loop and one simple robust loop. It was \nalso recalled that these two loops are performed by different sets of attitude sensors   , \nactuators, and control components. The choice of attitude control has a major impact \non the entire mission, and the architect    plays a leading role in selection process \nbecause it involves balancing the decision\u2019s con fl icting impacts on many aspects of \nthe mission. The attitude control architecture depends on the mission\u2019s speci fi c \nobservational needs. Most satellites observing the planet they orbit will be Nadir-\npointing   , while those making in situ    observations will be spin-stabilized   , and astro-\nnomical satellites will be inertially pointed   . In some cases a trade-off    between \nclasses of attitude is possible. Earth-observing geostationary satellites can be spin-\nstabilized or inertially stabilized; MSG    (Figure   7.3    ) is spin-stabilized while GOESS    \n(Figure   7.2    ) is inertially stabilized. Nadir-pointing    can be implemented with an iner-\ntially stabilized architecture, as with Sentinel-3    (Section  9.6.1 ), or with a gravity-\ngradient plus momentum bias    approach, such as Iridium    (Section  9.6.3 ). In the past, \ninertially stabilized systems were considered expensive but reasonably accurate \ninertially stabilized systems are now affordable. Surrey DMC    constellation (Section \n  11.4.4    ) is an example of cheap, inertially stabilized   , Nadir-pointed satellite. \nObservational needs also determine the level of accuracy required. Higher observa-\ntional accuracies will require higher accuracy sensors and actuators as well as faster \nacting wider bandwidth    control logic. Especially rapid attitude changes \u2013 as required \nby agile satellites    \u2013 require powerful devices such as control momentum gyros    or \nexceptionally large momentum wheels   . Some high-accuracy systems require the use \nof the instrument itself as an attitude sensor device. Telescopes that are used to study \nthe sky can act also as star sensors    and determine the attitude of the satellite. \nGOCE   \u2019s gravity-sensing    instrument (Section   10.3.1    ) is used to determine the \n satellite\u2019s angular accelerations   . For very high-accuracy systems, the choice of \n attitude control tools will also be in fl uenced by the need to minimize internal distur-\nbances, which could exclude the use of attitude actuators that cause mechanical \nperturbations   .  \n\n    9.9.3.   Coverage and revisit \n    9.9.3.1.   General \n Coverage was de fi ned in Section   8.4.2    , and Section   8.4.5     analyzed the relation \nbetween coverage and the systematic acquisition of data about a mission\u2019s area of \ninterest   , which may be anything from a speci fi c area of the Earth to the whole Earth \nor entire celestial sphere   . Systematic acquisition    provides regular synoptic views    of the \narea of interest and must meet requirements    to fully cover the area within a speci fi ed \nperiod of time. For observations of an orbited body, the coverage performance is a \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n294 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nfunction of the instrument swath    and the orbital track    pattern of the satellite or \nsatellites involved. In order to provide full coverage, the orbit track must traverse the \n surface with a repetitive and regular pattern separated by a distance smaller than the \ninstrument swath   , and the repetition cycle must be equal or smaller than the speci fi ed \nrevisit    period. Revisit was discussed also in Section   8.4.2    , and Section   8.4.5     examined \nthe relationship between revisit and interactive data acquisition. Revisit criteria are \nsimilar to those for coverage: the optimal orbital track must be identi fi ed, but with \nthe instrument\u2019s pointing    range    replacing that of instrument swath   . For celestial sphere \nobservations the orbit is irrelevant to coverage. To provide a synoptic view of the \nwhole celestial sphere the instrument swath    must be larger than the angular separation \nbetween the tracks produced by the changing satellite attitude    with respect to the celes-\ntial sphere. This will afford full coverage of the celestial sphere.  \n\n    9.9.3.2.   Repeat orbits \n As explained above, the best way to provide optimal coverage and revisit    over the Earth    \nis to  fl y a uniformly distributed orbital track   . The criterion for a repeat track orbit is that \nafter a speci fi c integer number of orbits the satellite-Earth geometry returns to its origi-\nnal point. In the case of Sun-synchr   onous orbits this means that  n  orbits coincide with \n m  solar days. In the case of non-Sun-synchronous    orbits it means that the differential \nangular speed between the Earth and the orbital plane    multiplied by the time necessary \nto complete exactly  n  orbits shall be equal to  m  times 360\u00b0. Figure  9.48  provides the \npossible repeat patterns for Sun-synchronous orbits. In the case of  m = 1  the orbital path    \nwould cover the Earth with regular repetitive tracks every day. In the range of altitudes \ncovered in Figure  9.48 , at 888.3 km of altitude, the orbital period    is 6,171.4 s and 14 \n\n700\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nR\nep\n\nea\nt c\n\nyc\nle\n\n le\nng\n\nth\n (\n\nda\nys\n\n) \nfr\n\nom\n 1\n\n to\n 4\n\n0 \nda\n\nys\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n750 800 850 900\n\nAltitude (km) as mean semi-major axis minus equatorial radius\n\nSentinel-3\n\nMinimum drift lines\n\nSentinel-2\nOne day repeat\n\nat 888.3 km\n\n950 1000 1050 1100\n\n  Figure 9.48.

The  fi gure also provides the location of the Sentinel-2    and \nSentinel-3    track patterns. As explained in 9.6.1, Sentinel-3\u2019s track pattern corresponds \nto an orbital period in which 385 orbits are performed in 27 days. This orbit provides \nexact repeats every 27 days and near exact repeats every 4 days. Sentinel-2\u2019s track pat-\ntern corresponds to 143 orbits in 10 days, and was chosen to provide optimal coverage \nof the Earth in 5 days for two satellites or 10 days with one satellite. Complete observa-\ntion of areas between tracks requires that either the swath or the pointing range    of the \ninstruments    is larger than the separation between tracks. Figure  9.49  provides the \nground incidences    and orbit altitudes    corresponding to such situations. According to \nFigure  9.49 , in order to cover the Earth in 1 day with a satellite  fl ying at 888.3 km of \naltitude, the incidence angles on the ground at the edge of the swath must be \u00b165.7\u00b0, the \nrequired pointing range \u00b153.2\u00b0 and the swath itself 2,789 km. With this large incidence \nangle   , images will be distorted and the quality of the images obtained at the edge of the \nswath will be inferior (Section   8.4.3    ). Additional time for full Earth coverage will \nimprove image quality. Again according to Figure  9.49 , if 2 days were allowed, one \nsatellite  fl ying at 720 km of altitude would need a maximum incidence angle of just 48\u00b0. \nThis same orbit would allow two satellites to provide 1-day coverage. The two satellites \nwould  fl y in the same orbit, with each of them daily covering the surface missed by the \nother. If one satellite fails, the remaining satellite would take up the slack, offering full \ncoverage every second day. This arrangement provides robustness, as the system con-\ntinues to function, albeit with reduced temporal revisit. Sentinel-2 uses this approach, \nwith two identical satellites  fl ying in the same orbit at an altitude of 786.1 km and \nanomalies separated by 180\u00b0. The orbit repeats exactly every 10 days. The two satellites \n(Figures  9.50  and  9.51 )  fl y interleaved tracks covering the Earth every 5 days. Sentinel-2 \ngathers highly accurate data on vegetation and biophysical parameters and requires the \n\n  Figure 9.49.

The instrument\u2019s swath is 274 km and the maximum \n incidence angle at the edge of the swath is 11.1\u00b0.     \n\n The concept of exact orbital repeat pattern    and optimal coverage also applies to \ninstruments    without swath. Radar altimeters    provide sea-level anomaly point measure-\nments (Section   8.5    ) used to provide data for global dynamic models of the ocean   . In this \ncase providing coverage means gathering a network of measurements every  m  days \ndense enough to allow the correct functioning of the global dynamic ocean models. The \nocean possesses very strong inertia; dynamic ocean currents and eddies span around \n\n  Figure 9.51.

Consistent with these facts, a repeat \nperiod of around 1 month and measurement density on the order of 50 km would be \nadequate. Figure  9.52  provides the 27-day track network of two Sentinel-3    satellites \nplus 10 days of the radar altimeter    mission Jason   . The tracks of the two Sentinel satel-\nlites combine to produce the required measurement density, while Jason\u2019s less dense \ntrack is dense enough to act as a reference for the whole set of measurements.     \n\n    9.10.   Allocation of budgets    \n\n Many key requirements    of orbit and attitude are values that must be apportioned \nbetween all the factors contributing to those requirements; thus, each of the key require-\nments    generate a budget that needs to be allocated among all possible error sources. The \nbudgets    related to instrument pointing    and satellite attitude    are especially complex. \nSection  9.8  has already introduced them. Speci fi cally, Section  9.8.1  and  9.8.2  already \nestablished the need to establish requirements for parameters like the absolute and \n relative pointing errors, and the absolute and relative knowledge errors. Those sections \nalso established the need to create requirements on pointing rate stability. The present \nsection is going to analyze the design alternatives associated with all these budgets. \n\n    9.10.1.   Satellite location \n\n All missions demand that the satellite\u2019s location be measured and controlled with a \ngiven level of accuracy. This will be required by the need to control the regular pat-\ntern of the orbit\u2019s ground track    (Figures  9.50 ) or by the obvious need to observe the \n\n  Figure 9.52.     Combined Tracks 27 Days of Track of Two Sentinel-3    (More Dense Thinner Net \nof Measurement Lines) and One Jason    (Less Dense Thicker Net of Lines) \nSatellites.       \n\n \n\n\n\n298 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nactual areas of interest    for the mission, making it necessary not only to have the \n correct attitude but also the correct orbital position. Errors in determining satellite \nlocation are most often caused by:\n\n   Errors in the ephemeris of real-time navigation satellites (GPS    or Galileo   ) in case \u2022 \nthey are used for orbit determination     \n  Errors in the relative velocity between satellite and ground station in cases where \u2022 \nthe orbit is determined from the ground by measuring the Doppler shift    of the \nsatellite signals  \n  Errors in the determination of atmospheric drag    and other orbit disturbance \u2022 \n factors, such as lunar-solar gravity    pull, or errors in gravity  fi eld data  \n  Errors in the orbit determination    algorithms  \u2022 \n  Orbit ephemeris projection errors  \u2022 \n  Timing errors       \u2022 \n\n As explained in Section  9.2.1 , in low Earth    orbit, autonomous orbit determination    \nis now possible using GPS    receivers on board the satellite, but almost all missions \nalso perform on-ground orbit determinations and uplink    the orbital predictions to the \nsatellite. The use of navigation satellites for deriving real-time orbit determinations \non board can provide satellite positions to an accuracy of 10 m or better. In most \ncases the requirements    for satellite position determination are moderate, but very \nhigh-resolution    Earth observation    calls for a correspondingly accurate orbit \ndetermination. \n\n Some applications, such as radar altimetry    (Section   8.5    ) or geodetic satellites, \ndemand detailed knowledge of the satellite\u2019s position for the derivation of the observ-\nables   . Precise \u201ca posteriori\u201d orbit determination    requires the use of high-accuracy \nnavigation receivers and complex processing. Orbit determination    to within a few \ncentimeters is now possible.  \n\n    9.10.2.   Instruments line of sight    pointing    and recovery \n\n The instrument line of sight    error is identical to the \u201cAPE   \u201d of Section  9.8.1 . The line of \nsight    recovery error will be identical to the \u201cAKE   \u201d of the same section. Recalling the \ndiscussion of Section  9.8.1 ,  9.8.2 , and  9.8.3 , the factors contributing to the APE are:\n\n   Attitude pointing errors    of the attitude control    system:\u2022 \n   Low frequency external perturbations    such as atmospheric drag    or gravity- \u2013\ngradient    torque  \n  Low frequency internal perturbations    such as large unbalanced slowly rotating  \u2013\nantennas or the uncorrected part of the thermoelastic deformations    affecting the \nattitude control    system  \n  Measurement errors of the attitude sensors   , including star trackers, magnetom- \u2013\neters,    or gyros  \n  Attitude control actuator errors   : momentum wheel, control momentum gyros   ,  \u2013\nthrusters,    and magneto-torques     \n  Control loop errors    and bandwidth   , control law and control, and commanding  \u2013\nalgorithm errors  \n  Timing errors   .      \u2013\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n299The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n  Thermoelastic deformation, from the attitude control    reference frame to the \u2022 \n instrument line of sight    reference frame  \n  Scan realization errors    in scanning instruments     \u2022 \n  Residual alignment bias and drifts    after in-orbit commissioning, between the \u2022 \n attitude control    reference frame and the instrument\u2019s line of sight       \n\n Attitude pointing    performances depend on the attitude control    subsystem   , as well \nas on internal and external perturbations produced by the environment, including \natmospheric drag   , gravity-gradient    torque, and solar wind    pressure torque, among \nothers. The satellite\u2019s attitude pointing error will depend on the speci fi ed quality of \nthe attitude sensors   , actuators, and the design of the control loop. A star tracker, for \ninstance, will experience random Gaussian errors produced by sources such as instru-\nment quanti fi cation or electronic noise. It will also experience harmonic errors and \ndrifts that might be caused by the sensor variations in temperature, and might also \nhave biases produced by assembly or integration errors. \n\n To observe the area of interest    the line of sight    must be pointed in the right direc-\ntion with an accuracy commensurate with the satellite\u2019s swath. In instruments    \n producing large-scale mosaics with many individual images the APE    will be driven \nby the need for a small overlapping between images to avoid noncovered gaps. But \nto properly locate the observations the line of sight    must be known with an accuracy \ncommensurate with the instrument\u2019s resolution. The spatial resolution    is much \nsmaller than the instrument  fi eld of view   . This means that the requirements    for line of \nsight knowledge \u201cAKE   \u201d will always be distinct and more demanding than the \nrequirements for line of sight realization \u201cAPE.\u201d \n\n For example the high-resolution    Pleiades    mission (Section  9.6.4 ) produces indi-\nvidual images of 20 km that are combined to produce large-scale or wide area mosa-\nics of images. To be able to produce an ef fi cient 10 % overlapping of images it will \nbe necessary to ask the satellite to point the instrument with an APE    = 2.8 mrad. \nHowever, Pleiades is required to properly locate autonomously the images on-ground \nwith an accuracy of 10 m. This requires the pointing    knowledge    to be better than 14 \n m rad. That means the APE requirement is 200 times more relaxed than that for the \nAKE   . Any AOCS subsystem    able to provide the pointing knowledge required by \nPleiades will provide the required absolute pointing without any dif fi culty. This will \nbe the case for most missions. \n\n In some special cases, some missions could have demanding line of sight    realiza-\ntion requirements   . To ensure the superior quality of its ocean altimetry    mission prod-\nucts   , Sentinel-3    (Section  9.6.1 ) imposed rigorous speci fi cations    on the altimeter\u2019s \nactual line of sight. The required actual pointing    must differ by less than \u00b10.2\u00b0 from \nthe perpendicular to the Earth   \u2019s ellipsoid. After readjustment trade-offs this highest-\nlevel error was allocated in the following way:\n\n   Attitude control system pointing    error: 0.10\u00b0  \u2022 \n  Radar altimeter boresight pointing    error: 0.04\u00b0  \u2022 \n  Satellite structure pointing    harmonics: 0.1\u00b0  \u2022 \n  Satellite structure pointing    bias: 0.05\u00b0    \u2022 \n\n This de fi ned a set of balanced requirements    for the attitude control    system and for \nthe stability of the satellite. The requirements differentiate between bias and \nharmonics errors as discussed in Section  9.8.2 . \n\n\n\n300 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n As said before most missions need the correct referencing of the observations to \ntheir place of origin. This will impose strict requirements    on the knowledge of the line \nof sight   . Factors contributing to line of sight knowledge are:\n\n   Attitude measurement errors of the attitude control    system:\u2022 \n   Measurement errors of attitude sensor   : star trackers, magnetometers,    or gyros   \u2013\n  Attitude estimation errors      \u2013\n  Timing errors         \u2013\n\n  Residual errors in the knowledge of the thermoelastic deformations    (bias, drift,    \u2022 \nand harmonic) of the instrument\u2019s line of sight     \n  Scan measurement errors    in scanning instruments     \u2022 \n  Residual errors in the knowledge of the bias and drifts    of the instrument line of \u2022 \nsight    reference frame    \n\n In the case of imaging instruments   , during the satellite\u2019s commissioning phase    but \nbefore the operational use of the instruments begins, it is possible to characterize the \nstatic and variable bias, and the harmonics deformations between the attitude and the \ninstrument reference frames. Comparing the actual and the nominal position of well-\nlocated ground or space reference control points make this possible, and the instru-\nment\u2019s line of sight    pointing    knowledge    errors will be reduced to the residual errors \nafter the introduction of the measured corrections. The residual bias error after in-\norbit correction    will be a function of the original nonbias error because the existence \nof a large nonbias error will complicate the accurate determination of the bias by \nusing reference control points. A good rule of thumb is that with good control points \nit should be possible to reduce the bias to around one-half of the original nonbias \npointing recovery errors. Comparing thermal analysis results, measured in-orbit tem-\nperatures and measured in-orbit misalignments can reduce harmonics error associated \nto the varying Sun    illumination during the orbit. This approach would reduce the \nharmonic errors associated with solar illumination and thermal conditions. It is gener-\nally accepted that it is possible to reduce the harmonic pointing errors to one third of \nits original value.  \n\n    9.10.3.   Pointing stability realization and recovery \n Sections  9.8.1  and  9.8.2  already discussed pointing stability    and how it was driven \nby the instrument integration time   . The time needed for integration will depend on \nthe instrument concept. The few detectors featuring a so-called whiskbroom    sight \nline (Figure   8.4    ) must perform a quick transversal scan of the orbit track in order \nto provide the required swath. In this case the integration time is very brief. \nSo-called pushbroo   m instruments    (Figure   8.4    ), on the other hand, produce the \nswath by means of a long  fi xed array with a large number of detectors, and the \ntime allocated for the integration of each detector\u2019s pixels can be much longer. \nThis longer period permits the integration of many more photons, resulting in \nsuperior radiometric quality   , but it also requires more demanding stability to \nensure steady instrument pointing during these longer intervals. The pointing sta-\nbility is directly related to the avoidance of the signal arriving from a single point \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n301The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\nbeing smeared between different receiving pixels. That means, the pointing stabil-\nity requirement shall be commensurate with the  angular resolution corresponding \nto a single pixel ( D  q  in Figure  9.47 ) divided by the integration interval    ( D  t  in \nFigure  9.47 ). Pointing stability can be very exacting in cases where very high-\nresolution instruments need long integration times. The following elements will \nalter the pointing stability:\n\n   External perturbations such as upper atmosphere winds  \u2022 \n  Low or medium frequency harmonics associated with thermoelastic deformations   , \u2022 \nor with the movement of large items like solar arrays    or large rotating \nmechanisms     \n  High frequency perturbations produced by rotary or linear mechanical actuators  \u2022 \n  High frequency attitude control    residuals associated with  fl exible satellite struc-\u2022 \ntures    that the attitude control system is unable to compensate for  \n  Possible high frequency structural perturbations produced by step events such as \u2022 \nthe thermal transients    from eclipses    to solar illumination, the operation of solar \narray    drive mechanisms,    or the  fi ring of thrusters       \n\n As discussed in Section  9.8.2  the attitude control    system will counteract the lower \nfrequency \u201cdrift\u201d perturbations that are inside its frequency range. This will generate \na maximum drift requirement that will drive the design of the AOCS. At the same \ntime, it will also be necessary to specify the maximum strength    of the lower frequency \ndrift perturbations that the AOCS shall be able to counteract. This maximum perturba-\ntion shall be apportioned between all the lower frequency perturbation sources. \n\n For higher frequency harmonic perturbations    and for broad band \u201cjitter\u201d    perturba-\ntions outside the capabilities of compensation of the attitude control   , the only way to \ncontrol the pointing    stability    is to limit the external and internal perturbations that \ngenerate pointing instability. This will require establishing supplementary perturba-\ntion budgets    that shall be apportioned between all the identi fi ed sources.  \n\n    9.10.4.   Geo-locating \n\n The observations received by the instruments    must be mapped to their place of origin; \nthis process is called geo-locating    and requires mapping each observation with \nrespect to an absolute reference frame. This requires:\n\n   Referring observations to the satellite\u2019s attitude reference frame  \u2022 \n  Transferring the satellite\u2019s reference frame to an absolute reference frame in the \u2022 \ncelestial sphere    or over the planet being observed  \n  Locating the source of the observation within this absolute reference frame    \u2022 \n\n Geo-   location requires that both the instrument\u2019s line of sight    (Section  9.10.2 ) and \nsatellite position (Section  9.10.1 ) along its orbit be correctly recovered. The discus-\nsion, budgets,    and apportionments discussed in Sections  9.10.1  and  9.10.2  are directly \napplicable to the discussion of geo-location   . In addition, geo-location    requires that each \npixel is allocated to its true geographical origin requiring supplementary reference \nframe transfers. So timing errors and time coordination error across the system elements \nare contributors. \n\n\n\n302 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n As in the case of the line of sight    pointing    recovery \u201cAKE   \u201d of Section  9.8.1 , geo-\nlocation    requirements    should also be commensurate with the instrument\u2019s spatial \nresolution   . In principle, the geo-location    requirement should be smaller than spatial \nresolution requirements. For resolutions of the order of a few hundred meters, geo-\nlocations between 0.2 and 0.4 of the spatial resolution would be a reasonable choice. \nHowever, if the resolution is tens of meters or less, providing a geo-locating    perfor-\nmance smaller than 1 pixel would be impossible. Pleiades    has a resolution of 0.7 m \nand a geo-location performance of 10 m. Geo-locating data forms part of a process in \nwhich the space elements and the ground elements support each other. Section  9.10.2  \nalready discussed the use of ground control points    to characterize pointing errors dur-\ning the satellite commissioning phase   . One supplementary possibility will be to use \nground control points continuously during the ground processing of the instrument \nimages. Each obtained image will contain clearly de fi ned landmarks of known posi-\ntion that can be used as reference tie-down points to provide feedback on the actual \nsatellite attitude    and to correctly geo-locate the whole image. Ground processing \nalgorithms use landmarks such as lakes, rivers, or coastlines; in astronomy, bright \nstars with accurately known positions can also act as landmarks. The algorithm will \nintegrate and  fi lter the satellite\u2019s attitude and orbit information, as well as the land-\nmarks to correct the instrument image and to provide an optimal estimate of the satel-\nlite\u2019s attitude, and an optimal geo-location for all pixels in the image. The improved \nattitude information can be relayed back to the satellite for use as adjustment factors \nby the attitude control    system (Figure  9.53 ).  \n\n This feedback between ground and space allows the requirements    on satellite atti-\ntude    recovery to be relaxed and the end-to-end performances    to be optimized. If this \napproach is used the end-to-end performance will now depend on the capacity of the \nin-orbit geo-location    (before ground processing) to be precise enough to act as a good \nstarting point for the ground-based image-processing algorithm. On the other hand, \nusing control points for each image will make the payload data processing slower and \nmore expensive and entails creating large databases of reference tie-down points. \n\n  Figure 9.53.     Image Geo-location    as an Interactive Space and Ground Process.       \n\n \n\n\n\n303The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\nFurthermore, this approach is only feasible when previous information on features of \nthe area in question are available; the  fi rst high-resolution images of a planet, for \ninstance, will lack any previous knowledge of the surface; and images of the open \nocean, with no land visible, would also lack any recognizable reference points. In \nsituations such as these, the geo-location performance will derive directly from the \nsatellite\u2019s performance.  \n\n    9.10.5.   Co-registration \n Co-registering is de fi ned as correctly identifying measurements from different bands \nof the same or different instruments    as coming from the same physical source. This \ncalls for identifying \u201crelative\u201d misalignment between and within instruments. There \nare fewer potential error sources for co-registration    than there are for geo-location   , \nbecause error sources acting in a uniform way over the whole satellite, attitude errors, \nfor example, will not add to the co-registration budget. However, the proper study of \nphysical processes requires the use of information obtained from several bands, per-\nhaps even from several instruments, and this information must be combined with an \naccuracy far smaller than a pixel, so co-registration requirements    of the order of 0.1 \nor 0.2 of a pixel are frequently called for. \n\n In instruments    featuring a single line of sight   , co-registration    will be internal to the \ninstrument, and will produce requirements on maximum allowable distortions \nbetween the different focal planes and between the different optical paths for the same \ninstrument. The total allowable co-registration requirements will be apportioned \nbetween all the error sources, and the allocation will generate derived requirements \non thermal control   , the use of high stability materials, assembly procedures, and on-\nground testing. The entire apportioning process will be internal to the instrument, and \nwill normally fall under the responsibility of the instrument specialist. In cases of \nco-registration requirements between different instruments, on the other hand, the \narchitect    will become involved, and the total co-registration budget will be divided \nbetween the instruments and the structure connecting them. \n\n Co-registration measurements performed by the same satellite using different \ninstruments    with different lines of sight and scan patterns are especially complex. \nSentinel-3   \u2019s SLSTR instrument (Figure  9.54 ) features two conical scanning lines of \nsight, and the OLCI instrument has an asymmetric pushbroom    across-track     fi eld of \nview. To provide improved information on the status of global plant life, co-registery \nof data from both instruments to its real physical origin is required. This means that \nthe mechanical stability inside and between each instrument must be speci fi ed, as \nwell as the accuracy of the SLSTR scanning mechanisms   .   \n\n    9.10.6.   Repointing agility    requirements    \n Instruments with interactive image    acquisition (Section   8.4.5    ) obtain images sequen-\ntially over different areas according to regularly updated image acquisition plans   . \nA value must be speci fi ed representing the time needed for the satellite to acquire two \nconsecutive images over two different areas.

At other times signi fi cant attitude changes \nwill be needed to cope with situations requiring urgent observations. In any case an \nagile satellite    that permits rapid attitude changes will be able to provide more images, \nthus increasing the value of the mission. Superior agility    calls for:\n\n   Reducing the time needed for repointing    the instrument from one target to the \u2022 \nnext. This entails implementing powerful attitude control    actuators and reducing \nthe satellite\u2019s inertia matrix by designing a compact craft.  \n  Reducing tranquilization time   , that is, the time needed by the instrument to recover \u2022 \nsuf fi cient stability after repointing to acquire an acceptable image. This means \nincreasing the AOCS bandwidth    to allow fast compensation for any remaining \noscillations as well as to stiffen the satellite.    \n\n The last paragraph of Section  9.6.4  describes the agility    performance of Pleiades   . \nAs explained there, the satellite has a powerful control momentum gyro, low inertia, \nand high stiffness   . The whole satellite external con fi guration    (Figure  9.29 ) is driven \nby the need for compactness and stiffness to allow fast repointing. \n\n Agile    missions like Pleiades    can provide  fl exible pointing    strategies while produc-\ning a large number of images (Figure  9.55 ).   \n\n    9.10.7.   Delta    V and fuel \n\n Satellites have recourse to various sources of energy to meet their propulsion    needs. \nA portion of this energy can be generated by rendezvousing with planets   , as Ulysses    \n\n  Figure 9.54.     Sentinel-3    Co-registration    Geometry.       \n\n \n\n\n\n305The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\ndid (Section  9.6.2  and Figure  9.23 ). Another option is delivered by specialized \nsources of thrust   , which form part of the mission but are not part of the satellite: the \nIUS    and PAM    rockets used to accelerate Ulysses (Figure  9.27 ) are an example of \nthese. Nevertheless, the satellite will still need to carry enough fuel on board to per-\nform all the necessary remaining orbit correction    and maintenance maneuvers. This \non-board fuel must be apportioned among all the events requiring it:\n\n   Launchers    never actually place satellites into their exact required orbits, and all \u2022 \norbit injection errors    must be corrected by means of on-board fuel. The launcher    \nspecialist will provide  fi gures for the average and worst-case injection errors, and \nthe satellite must supply the corresponding on-board fuel to compensate for them.  \n  Some missions are designed to allow large orbit correction    maneuvers, and carry \u2022 \nsuf fi cient fuel to perform them. MSG    for instance, was placed by the launcher    in \na highly elliptic    GTO    geotransfer orbit, and the satellite carried enough fuel to \nreach its  fi nal circular geostationary orbit   . It needed 800 kg of fuel to perform this \nlarge orbit correction.  \n  Satellites requiring precise orbit control    will need to regularly correct any orbital \u2022 \ndrift    produced by external perturbations. In low Earth    orbit the main cause of drift \nwill be atmospheric drag   . In geostationary orbits   , the Sun    and Moon   \u2019s gravitational \npull will alter the orbit inclinations and this effect needs to be compensated for.  \n  The space environment    is now densely populated and to prevent close encounters \u2022 \nwith other orbiting objects some fuel needs to be allocated for possible collision \navoidance    maneuvers.  \n\n  Figure 9.55.

This diminishes costs, but prevents them from making any orbit correction    \nmaneuvers. This approach is acceptable for most technology demonstration missions \nand for some science missions not demanding high-accuracy orbits. Given that drift    \nfrom the nominal orbit increases with time, operational missions   , which normally call \nfor long lives, do need some form of orbit control   . \n\n The sum of all the fuel allocated for each requisite maneuver will determine the \noverall fuel needs. The calculation of each maneuver\u2019s fuel needs usually includes its \nown safety margin. The launcher    specialist provides worst-case orbit injection errors    \nthat are generally larger than the actual one, and the overall budget also includes a \nsystem-wide safety margin on the order of 10% or more. This combination of safety \nmargins    means that the \u201cmost likely\u201d fuel expenditure will be less than the reference \ndesign case, and as a result, most satellites\u2019 fuel lasts much longer than originally \nplanned, offering the possibility to extend the mission\u2019s life.  \n\n    9.10.8.   Mechanical perturbations \n\n Mechanical disturbances alter the pointing    and pointing stability    of the instruments    \nand to establish pointing and pointing stability requirements    will automatically estab-\nlish requirements for the mechanical perturbations    on board. Nevertheless, on mis-\nsions where there are very strict pointing requirements and many sources of possible \ninternal mechanical perturbations \u2013 for example, many mechanisms    \u2013 it will be good \nto have a speci fi c budget of mechanical perturbations. The resulting mechanical per-\nturbations budget will provide a reference for the design of all the sources of mechan-\nical perturbations.  \n\n In line with the discussion of Section  9.8 , the budget shall specify in the frequency \ndomain. It is possible to identify three frequency ranges (Figure  9.56 ):\n\n   A low frequency range, where as frequency goes up the perturbation requirements    \u2022 \nwill become tighter  \n  A medium frequency range where the requirements    will be constant  \u2022 \n  A high frequency range where as the frequency becomes higher, the perturbation \u2022 \nrequirements    will be relaxed    \n\n At low frequency the perturbations will be compensated by the attitude control    of \nthe satellite. As the frequency becomes slower and slower the attitude control sensors \nand actuators will have more and more time to measure and to compensate these \nperturbations. This will allow tolerating larger perturbations as the frequency of these \nperturbations decreases. At very high frequency the attitude control system will be \nunable to control the perturbations. Nevertheless, high frequency perturbations will \nbe unable to have a large impact in pointing    because the fast changing perturbations \nwill not have time enough to alter by much the pointing. This is the reason why the \nspeci fi ed allowed perturbations curve can increase as frequency increases. Between \n\n\n\n307The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\nthese two extremes, there will always be a central frequency range where the allowed \nmechanical perturbation requirements    will be minimal. \n\n The resulting \u2013 frequency dependent \u2013 maximum perturbation envelopes can be \nused to specify the values allocated to the different sources of mechanical perturba-\ntions   , which will be also frequency dependent. The addition in the frequency domain \nof all the speci fi ed values shall be smaller than the maximum allowed disturbances at \nall frequencies.   \n\n    9.11.   Implementation and maintenance of constellations \n\n Some missions require that numerous satellites maintain a speci fi c geometry in rela-\ntion to each other; these satellites constitute a constellation. The use of multi-satellite \nconstellations    was touched on brie fl y in Section   7.3    . Section   8.4.2     examined issues \nassociated with using constellations to avoid de fi cient image quality at the edges of \nlarge swath    instruments   , and Section  9.9.3  discussed the process of choosing the right \norbit altitude    and number of satellites to provide the desired coverage and revisit   . In \naddition to ful fi lling mission requirements   , constellations also provide a robust archi-\ntecture able to cope with the failure of individual satellites without threatening the \nviability of the mission as a whole. This robustness is especially advantageous for \noperational missions   , and it is not accident that the three examples provided are all \noperational missions   . \n\n The present section will present supplementary discussions about constellation \ndesign and maintenance. Section  9.6  included descriptions of three constellations: \nSentinel-3   , Iridium,    and Pleiades   .

For missions consisting of just a few \nsatellites, such as Pleiades    or Sentinel-3   , it is a question of how and when to launch \nthem. Ideally they should be launched as close in time to one another as possible in \norder to begin ful fi lling the mission\u2019s aims. However, in order to maintain the produc-\ntion and industrial organization at a reasonable size, the sequential manufacturing and \ndelivery of the satellites have to be optimized, even though it could mean delays \nbetween consecutive satellites. In some cases funding for the mission is a step-by-\nstep process and may mean employing fewer satellites than required for extended \nperiods of time. \n\n A single Pleiades    or Sentinel-3    satellite can still provide good quality images, but \nits coverage or revisit     fi gures will be double the desired values. Though this is not \nideal, it could be acceptable in certain circumstances. Iridium   , on the other hand, \nneeds all of its satellites if it is to provide continuous communications coverage, \nwhich is the mission\u2019s fundamental aim, and a constellation with only half its satel-\nlites providing service just half the time, would be totally unacceptable. Hence, this \nkind of mission demands the speedy launch of all the constellation\u2019s constituent \nsatellites. \n\n Launchers    can accommodate multiple satellites. The change of orbital inclination, \nhowever, requires a very large amount of energy and multiple satellites in a single \nlaunch are only feasible if all the satellites are to be injected into the same or very \nnearby orbital planes   . Conversely, placing satellites at different points along the same \norbital path    only requires small amounts of energy. Iridium    uses several types of large \nlaunchers able to inject  fi ve (in the case of Delta   ) or seven (in the case of Proton   ) \nsatellites simultaneously into the same orbital plane   . One or more replacement satel-\nlites must also sometimes be launched to compensate for eventual failures; small \nlaunchers   , such as Rockot    and Long-March, used by Iridium, can ful fi ll this replace-\nment function. This need for  fl exibility is a major con fi guration    driver and will be \ndiscussed further Chapter   10     (Section   10.2.1     and Figure   10.5    ). \n\n Operational meteorology    also requires the use of constellations. The atmosphere \nis dynamic and a system monitoring the weather needs to provide very rapid cover-\nage. The World Meteorological Organization 18  requires that synoptic coverage of the \nEarth    to be refreshed every 4 h. This requirement can be ful fi lled by a constellation \nof LEO    satellites in three equally distributed orbital planes    separated by 4 h of local \ntime   . The NPOESS    meteorological LEO constellation (Figure  9.15 ) ful fi lls these \nrequirements   . Each of the three NPOESS satellites provides horizon-to-horizon \nimages, and each can provide full Earth coverage in a day; the three together ful fi ll \nthe 4 h requirement. This requires a maximum incidence angle    at the edge of the \nswath of around 68\u00b0. The resulting image distortion is not ideal but the users consider \nit acceptable. \n\n Not all missions call for whole Earth    coverage; when the area of interest    is limited, \norbits can be chosen which optimize revisits over the area using a moderate number \nof satellites. Forest  fi res can occur at any time; they evolve swiftly with dangerous \nimplications for life and property. The Fuego constellation was designed to provide \n\n   18   Final Report of the CGMS-WMO Optimization Workshop, Optimization of Satellite Observation \nMissions, WMO 2006.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n309The Orbit and Attitude Domain \n\n30 min of revisit    over two bands around the Earth between 35\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 of latitude. \nThis limitation was acceptable because the monitoring of  fi res in Mediterranean for-\nests is the fundamental aim of Fuego 19  and all Mediterranean forests are located at \nthese latitudes. To ful fi ll this very demanding revisit schedule    the mission features 12 \nsatellites in a Walker constellation    distributed equally in three orbital planes     fl ying at \nan altitude of 700 km with an orbit inclination    of 47.5\u00b0. The actual revisit  fi gure over \nthe area of interest was 23 min. Walker constellations 20  contain  n  satellites distributed \nuniformly in  p  planes. All the orbital planes have identical altitudes and the same \ninclination with respect to the Earth\u2019s equatorial plane   . The ascending nodes    of the  p  \nplanes are uniformly distributed around the Equator   . To completely de fi ne the con-\nstellation, it is necessary to also de fi ne the difference in anomaly between satellites in \nadjacent orbital planes. This separation is indicated by a third parameter  f ; if a satellite \nis at its ascending node    the next most easterly satellite will be past the node by  f  times \n360\u00b0 divided by the number of satellites in the constellation.        \n\n   19   D.

This chapter starts with a brief introduction \nto the elements and components included in this domain that are related to the \n\u201cmechanical\u201d space engineering disciplines. It continues analyzing how the external \nenvironment    drives the con fi guration    of a satellite and then examines the associated \ndesign decisions for four missions:\n\n   The gravity-sensing    mission GOCE   , which is a Nadir-pointing    satellite, in a Sun-\u2022 \nsynchronous    orbit    250 km above the Earth   , and whose design is driven by the need \nto minimize atmospheric drag   .  \n  The Ulysses    mission studied before in Chapters  \u2022  8     and   9    , whose con fi guration    is \ndriven by large communication antennas   , its spinning attitude, and its long booms.  \n  JWST   , an inertially stabilized    astronomical observatory     fl ying in a halo orbit    \u2022 \naround the Lagrangian    L2    point   , introduced in Chapters   7     and   8    , whose \ncon fi guration    is driven by the need to protect its large deployable telescope    from \nthe heat of the Sun   .  \n  Iridium   , which is a Nadir-pointing    communications constellation,    already intro-\u2022 \nduced in Chapter   9    . Its con fi guration    is driven: by the need to accommodate small \nor large numbers of satellites in different launchers, by the need to provide good \nvisibility to the different communication antennae    it carries, and by the need to \ncope with very variable geometry with respect to the Sun   .    \n\n The missions selected are both large and small in scale, perform both \u201cin situ   \u201d mea-\nsurements and remote sensing   , and  fl y in different orbits with distinct satellite attitudes. \nHence, they provide a wide range of applications and situations illustrating the different \nfactors affecting the con fi guration    of a space mission. However, the number of \ncon fi guration drivers is high, and the possible design alternatives are numerous. The \nexamples outlined above are insuf fi cient by themselves to cover the whole spectrum of \nrelevant design decisions, and when necessary reference to other missions will be made. \n\n The chapter continues with a section on the impact of the geometry around the \nsatellite \u2013 location of the Sun   , Earth   , observable,    and deep space    \u2013 and how it acts as \na con fi guration    driver.

When compared with the orbit/attitude domain \n(Figure   9.1    ) the con fi guration domain    entails a smaller number of interactions. The \ncon fi guration    design decisions are characterized also by the fact that they respond to \nprevious design decisions made in other domains. This explains why all the arrows \nin Figure  10.1  point toward the con fi guration domain. This dependency explains why \nthe con fi guration is undertaken only after the basic instrument concept, the orbit, the \nattitude, and the launcher   (s), are established: \n\n   The physical envelope provided by the launcher    will provide the available volume \u2022 \nand determine the need for deployable structures   .  \n  The launch loads    driven by the launcher    and the in-orbit loads    driven by the attitude \u2022 \nand orbit control    will govern the strength    and stiffness    of the stowed and deployed \ncon fi gurations.  \n  The constraints imposed by the annual variation in solar illumination, the cold of \u2022 \ndeep space,    and the location(s) of the intended sources to be imaged or measured, \nall taken together, constrain the choices of orbit and sensor attitude(s) available, \nand these in turn contribute to the determination of the satellite con fi guration   .  \n  The attitude control    concept will drive the satellite con fi guration   . This was already \u2022 \nmentioned in Section   7.1.3    .  \n  The orbital change    and orbital control    needs will drive the con fi guration    of the \u2022 \npropulsion    and of the whole satellite.  \n  External environmental forces including drag, solar pressure, and gravity gradi-\u2022 \nents, which are the functions of the orbit and the attitude, will also drive the \ncon fi guration   .    \n\n In line with the heuristic    that the mission is designed around the instruments   , it is \nthe instrument\u2019s complement that must be con fi gured  fi rst and as a whole if there are \nmultiple sensors to be accommodated. It is possible that they have quite different, \ncomplementary and/or con fl icting viewing requirements   . These instruments must \n fi rst be sized so as to optimize their own con fi guration    and minimize their mass and \nsize while being performance compliant. The outcome of applying all technical \nconstraints and requirements of Figure  10.1  is a payload con fi guration that may be \nconsidered the optimum from a technical point of view, but there is one further con-\nsideration that may alter the  fi nal choice. This consideration is the possible provision \n\n  Figure 10.1.

Components involved in the domain \n\n The satellite con fi guration   \u2019s overall de fi nition will depend on the de fi nition of the \nfollowing subsystems:\n\n   Primary and secondary structure     \u2022 \n  Thermal control  \u2022 \n  Deployment and pointing    mechanisms     \u2022 \n  Solar array as mechanical and thermal element    \u2022 \n\n    10.1.1.   Structure    \n\n Structural engineering    was introduced in Section   2.4.1    . Structure    was de fi ned there as \nevery physical part of the satellite that carries loads and/or supports or protects other \nparts of the satellite. The structure is usually split into primary and secondary assem-\nblies. The primary structure    is the part of the structure subsystem    that de fi nes the \noverall shape of the satellite, carries the main loads,    and de fi nes the satellite\u2019s funda-\nmental vibration frequencies   . The primary structure also provides the interfaces to all \nground support equipment    and to speci fi c test facilities, used for on-ground assembly, \nintegration, and testing. The secondary structure    includes all the parts holding the \nindividual satellite components attached to the primary structure, with negligible \nparticipation on the main loads transfer and with no major effect on the fundamental \nvibration frequencies. Each section of the secondary structure ensures that a satellite \ncomponent is compatible with the local stiffness    and strength    requirements    applying \nto that component. \n\n The structure, both primary and secondary, consists of structural components: \nbeams, plates,  fl anges, shear carrying skins, and longerons. Joining components con-\nnects these structural components: screws, nuts, welds, adhesive, and rivets. Structural \ncomponents for space applications are designed for stiffness   , strength,    and lightness. \nTo ensure dimensional stability   , low thermal expansion    is another parameter of high \nvalue for space applications. Aluminum and titanium are extensively used for struc-\ntural space applications. Carbon- fi ber reinforced plastics provide strong, stiff, stable, \nand lightweight structures    and are also extensively used. Honeycomb sandwiches \nwith aluminum and Carbon- fi ber core and skins are also commonly used. \n\n The most important design decision is the de fi nition of the primary structure   . This \naspect is mainly driven by the overall external con fi guration    and by the launch loads   , \nwhich are the most demanding load environment   . During launch, the primary struc-\nture is clamped    to the launcher    and is free at the top; so the primary structure at launch \nis a cantilever beam   . The primary structure can be constructed around a central tube, \npanels, or a lattice of beams. Figure  10.2  shows the internal structure of Sentinel-3   ; \nin the lower half the structure is built around a central tube, and the upper half around \npanels. Figure  10.9  shows the Proteus    structural concept, which is an example of a \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_2\n\n\n314 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nstructure based on a lattice of beams. The primary structural concept includes the \nchoice of material for the structure: metallic or nonmetallic. Metallic structures    are \nheavier and provide lower thermal dimensional stability    but they are easier to repeat-\nedly join and separate. They are also usually cheaper than composite structures    too. \nThe secondary structure    is not normally considered during a project\u2019s early design \nphases. As the mechanical design is strongly dependent on the launcher, the architect    \nmust provide specialists with at least two possible launchers, a nominal one and a \nback-up, so that the structure can be designed against the most demanding load enve-\nlope permitted by the launchers under consideration. Another important design deci-\nsion is whether the satellite will be a single structural block or divided into sections \nthat can be handled separately on-ground. Most medium and large-sized satellite \nstructures are divided into two parts: a lower one where most of the satellite subsys-\ntems are located and an upper one were the instruments    are located. This structural \ndivision allows the parallel assembly and testing of the two halves of the satellite \nbefore they are joined. This simpli fi es and shortens the assembly and test process.  \n\n The architect    shall follow the advice of the specialist regarding the structural \ndesign and the materials to be used; nevertheless, the architect shall take the lead in \nthe selection of the \u201cexternal\u201d shape of the satellite, because many con fl icting factors \nin fl uence the external shape, including the visibility of the instruments   , the environ-\nment, the attitude, the orbit, and the launcher   . Of particular interest is the stiffness    of \nthe spacecraft in both its launch con fi guration    and in-orbit one, in order to ensure \ncompatibility with the launch environment and to assess potential dynamic coupling \nbetween the in-orbit con fi guration    and the AOCS. In both cases it is the domain of \nthe structural specialist to aid the architect to achieve such compatibilities. Most satel-\nlites have a structural subsystem    that is under the responsibility of a specialized \nsupplier   , which delivers the primary structure    of the satellite. Each piece of secondary \nstructure    is normally the responsibility of the supplier that is delivering the compo-\nnents supported by the secondary structure.  \n\nMWR OLCI\n\nSLST\n\nGIREL\n\nLRA\n\nSRAL ant\n\nX-band ant\n\n3 x STR\nS-band ant\n\nS-band antGNSS ant\n\nGNSS ant\n\nDoris ant\n\n  Figure 10.2.

Thermal \n\n Thermal engineering was introduced in Section   2.4.2    . \n The components necessary to ful fi ll the thermal control    functions include: those \n\nthat produce heat; those used for storing, conducting, and radiating heat; those \ncapable of using external  fl uid loops    energy to transfer heat; components that locally \nenhance or isolate heat transfer for temperature-sensitive hardware; and those used to \ncontrol the other thermal components: temperature sensors   , heaters   , harnesses, and \nmanage the thermal control logic   . \n\n The thermal energy received by the satellite is mostly produced by the Sun   \u2019s heat \nand is absorbed in the visible part of the spectrum (Figures  10.11  and   9.3    ), but the \nenergy emitted by the satellite is at a much lower temperature of the satellite itself \nand is emitted in the infrared    range. Additionally, satellites orbiting a planet receive \ndirectly emitted infrared    radiation and re fl ected solar radiation (albedo     fl ux) from the \nplanet\u2019s surface onto those facets of the satellite that have a view factor to its surface, \nand these must also be taken into account in the satellite\u2019s thermal design   , as must \nany multiple re fl ections and absorptions of these sources of environmental heat  fl ux \nbetween re fl ective facets of the satellite. Therefore, surfaces that are ef fi cient emitters \nin the infrared    and absorb poorly in the visible range\u2014like white paint or quartz over \nsilver optical re fl ectors \u2013 will cool the satellite, while surfaces that are poor emitters \nin the infrared    but are good absorbers in the visible \u2013 like polished aluminum or gold \u2013 \nwill heat the satellite. Black paint, which has both a high infrared    emissivity     e  and \nhigh visible absorptivity     a  properties, is used for good coupling in both directions: \ncooling    and heating   . The equilibrium temperature of a surface free from heat from \nany other source (e.g., such as internal conduction) and using thermo-optical materi-\nals for its thermal control    depends entirely upon the solar absorptance, to infrared    \nemissivity ratio  a / e , but it must be noted that highly polished surfaces having low \nvalues of  a  early in the mission can soon degrade to much higher values, due to dam-\nage from charged particle impacts and exposure to ultraviolet light throughout the \nmission. This degradation can signi fi cantly alter the  a / e  ratio over time, so it is neces-\nsary to design the thermal con fi guration    to account for such changes by analyzing the \nthermal balance    of the satellite for when the material is new and at the end of the \nexpected life. A warming of the surface will occur as it ages given a constant expo-\nsure to the external environment   . The emissivity properties are not nearly so sensitive \nand are usually regarded as constant throughout the mission. To provide surfaces that \nisolate the satellite from the environment, multilayer insulation    is used. Multilayer \ninsulation blankets can consist of alternative layers of poor radiators separated by \nnets, hence avoiding contacts and conductive leaks between the layers, or multiple \nlayers of crinkled highly re fl ective sheets. The latter type avoids the mass of the net-\nted layers but risks increased interlayer conductive leaks through the thickness of the \nblanket. In both cases these blankets must be vented to prevent entrapped air between \nthe layers conducting heat. Consequently, a blanket\u2019s insulating performance is a \nfunction of the number of layers used. In practice the situation is more complex. As \nthe number of layers increases, the chance of achieving a good interlayer vacuum \ndiminishes and so gas conduction between the layers adds to the heat transmission. \nThis is a risk for short-term missions such as on the space shuttle. Also, such blankets \nonly work with full ef fi ciency on  fl at or single curvature surfaces, as any compression \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_2\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n316 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nof the blankets leads to signi fi cant increase in the through-blanket conduction rate. \nInside the satellite it is also necessary to provide thermal interchanges. This can be \ndone by radiation or by conduction. Black paint is used for radiation coupling   . The \nconduction is provided by speci fi c components that become progressively more com-\nplicated as the amounts of heat to be transferred became larger: thermal doublers to \ntransfer moderate amounts of heat; heat pipes    for higher amounts; and active  fl uid \nloops    for the highest heat  fl ows. Some instruments   , like thermal infrared    detectors, \nmust operate at very low temperatures   . Complex, multistage purely passive cooling    \ncan meet this requirement, but the resulting arrangement strongly in fl uences the \ncon fi guration of the whole satellite. An alternative is to provide \u201cactive\u201d heat pumps   , \nwhich require a  fl uid loop and the provision of mechanical energy. This allows pump-\ning the heat, permitting very low temperatures to be achieved in a speci fi c location. \nThis option will be discussed in detail in Section  10.5.4 . Coolant  fl uids    can provide \nextremely low temperatures. ISO   , described in Chapter   7    , used 2,100 l of liquid He    \nat 1.8 K to cool the telescope    by changing phase from liquid to gas as it was vented \ninto the space. This limited the life of the mission, which ended when the coolant was \nexhausted. Compared with the numerous components used to cool satellites, there is \njust a single dedicated component to heat them up: electric heaters   . The heaters are \nmounted in the areas requiring heat, and they are switched on or off according to the \ncurrent temperature and the overall thermal control strategy. Thermal components are \ncontrolled by digital control loops, but they can also use simple analog control \napproaches, such as on-off switches controlled by thermostats. This robust approach \nensures the survival of the satellite in failure situations, even in cases involving inop-\nerative computers. Another simple control approach involves the use of mobile, \nscreen-like blinds    with either high thermal radiation or effective insulation properties \nthat can be alternatively exposed to the external environment. \n\n The  fi rst decision is to decide what surfaces are going to be used for radiative \ninterchange with the environment and what surfaces are going to be isolated from the \nenvironment. This decision is directly driven by the orbital geometry: to allow heat \ndissipation    the radiating surfaces must have a good view of cold space    and be pro-\ntected from strong solar irradiance. Closely linked with the decision above is the need \nto establish the tools to be used for thermal control   ; whether they will be simple or \ncomplicated. Radiative surfaces and heaters    are considered simple. Heat pipes and \nblinds are considered moderately complicated; heat pumps   , complex passive radia-\ntors able to cool to very low temperatures   , and coolers like liquid He   , are considered \ncomplicated. If simple tools are used, the satellite con fi guration    and attitude will be \nstrongly shaped by thermal constraints. If complicated tools are used, the satellite \ncon fi guration and attitude will be far freer but the thermal control becomes more \ncomplicated. \n\n The use, or not, of moderately complex or very complex thermal control    devices is \ndetermined by the requirements    of the instruments   . Some instruments \u2013 such as infra-\nred    detectors \u2013 must operate at very low temperatures   , while others \u2013 such as lasers \u2013 \ndissipate very high levels of heat. As mentioned above, the choice of complex thermal \ncontrol solutions complicates thermal control matters but simpli fi es the overall \ncon fi guration   . So the  fi nal decision regarding these questions rests with the architect   . \n\n Design decisions on a satellite with simple thermal control    requirements    and \nwith fairly constant thermal dissipation geometry are the responsibility of the \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n317The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\nspecialist, who shall also provide the design for the special thermal requirements of \nthe instruments    or of any other satellite component requiring special thermal care. \nThat said, the location of the radiative surfaces must be decided upon by the archi-\ntect   , because this decision directly affects the overall con fi guration   , as well as both \nthe satellite\u2019s attitude and chosen orbit, all of which are crucial, high-level design \ndecisions. \n\n The satellite has a set of thermal control    components that ensure the proper ther-\nmal control of the overall satellite. These components are normally joined together \ninto a thermal control subsystem   , which is under the responsibility and control of one \nspecialized supplier   . On the other hand, the satellite may have dedicated thermal \ncontrol assemblies to ful fi ll the thermal control needs of speci fi c parts, such as the \nscienti fi c instruments   . The delivery of these components is normally put under the \nresponsibility of the supplier in charge of the corresponding part.  \n\n    10.1.3.   Mechanisms \n\n Space mechanisms    engineering was introduced in Section   2.4.3    . \n Mechanisms are complex and diverse and are located throughout the varied parts \n\nof the satellite that require recon fi gurations. Hold-downs    restrain satellite compo-\nnents in their stowed con fi guration   . During launch these components behave as struc-\ntural fasteners: nuts, straps, or locks. Once in orbit, the nuts can be split, the straps \ncut, or the locks opened using specialized actuators. Mechanical locks are also used \nto restrain and support the structure in the deployed con fi guration   . Actuators furnish \nthe torque or force required to provide movements and allow the recon fi guration. The \nmost  fl exible and common device is the electric motor, but stored elastic energy pro-\nvided by torsion or linear springs are also widely used. If electrical drivers are used, \nit is necessary to provide movement control electronics    and position and speed mea-\nsuring devices. Elastic energy drivers do not need control electronics, but to avoid \nuncontrolled deployment, devices are employed that dissipate energy when the veloc-\nity increases. Cables and pulleys or linkages transfer the torques or forces provided \nby the actuators to the places where they need to be applied. Bearings and coatings \nare used to reduce the friction generated by the movements. Ball and roller bearings \nare used as well as liquid and solid lubricant layers. Mechanisms can be divided into \nsingle and multiple actuation devices. Satellite recon fi guration mechanisms    only need \nto operate once. Pointing devices on the other hand require multiple or continuous \nactuation. Operational momentum wheels    and momentum control gyros, used for \nsatellite attitude control   , also operate continuously. A special type of pointing    mecha-\nnism is used for rotating the solar array    toward the Sun    in order to maximize energy \nproduction. \n\n As in the case of thermal components there is a trade-off    between complicating the \nmechanism and complicating the con fi guration   . Complex deployable mechanisms    \ncan be used to reduce the mass and the stowed volume of the satellite, allowing the \naccommodation of the satellite in smaller and less expensive launchers. Pointing \nthe whole satellite can eliminate pointing mechanisms   , and solar arrays    can be oversized \nto make unnecessary the use of solar array    drive mechanisms. The trade-off between \ncomplicating the mechanisms and complicating the rest of the satellite is a complex \nissue whose solution depends on the speci fi c circumstances of each mission. It must \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_2\n\n\n318 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nbe decided whether the drive is going to be provided by electrical or mechanical \nmotors. Single-shot mechanisms can normally be implemented using springs that do \nnot require electronic control; but to avoid excessive deployment speeds and end \nof deployment shock loads, speed control devices are often needed for spring-driven \ndeployments. It is also highly desirable that any mechanism can be reset to its original \nstate without replacing any parts, so that the mechanism tested on-ground is the same \nas that used in orbit. Such resetting is a frequent requirement on-ground during AIV \nprocedures. Devices using one-shot actuators risk replacing the active unit with one \nthat will not work when required. \n\n Mechanisms are distributed throughout the satellite: large deployable appendages \nlike antennae or solar arrays    can have their mechanisms   ; instruments    requiring \npointing    or scanning have their own internal mechanisms; and rotary actuators are \nused by the attitude control    subsystem    of the satellite. All these mechanisms share the \nsame problems and they require from their designers similar types of skills, but each \nmechanism interacts strongly with the components around it. That means mecha-\nnisms are not a natural subsystem. \n\n Mechanism design is a highly specialized activity and the specialist will be respon-\nsible for all the associated design decisions. The architect    will be directly involved on \nissues related to overall con fi guration   ; for example, the trade-off    between a light-\nweight satellite with large complex deployables compatible with a small launcher   , \nversus a larger, heavier satellite with fewer or no deployables but requiring the use of \na larger launcher. Complex mechanisms    may make the satellite lighter but they can be \nunreliable and dif fi cult to develop and test. The satellite\u2019s  fi nal con fi guration and the \nresulting level of mechanism complication is one area where the architect needs to \ndevote an especially high level of attention. The ground testability of large deployable \nmechanisms    is another area that requires the architect\u2019s early attention because of its \nimpact on costs and the credibility of the validation    approach.  \n\n    10.1.4.   Solar array \n\n Solar cells    transform solar energy into electrical power. To ful fi ll this function the \nsolar cells    need structural supporting panels as well as deployment and tracking \nmechanisms   . The structural panels will hold the cells in the stowed and deployed \ncon fi gurations, while the deployment mechanisms    will recon fi gure the solar panels    \nfrom the stowed to the deployed con fi guration   , and the tracking mechanisms shall \nrotate the whole solar array    in order to align it as closely as possible with the Sun   . \n\n Solar cells    transform solar energy into electrical energy. The Sun    radiates 1,367 W/\nm 2  at 1 AU. Solar cells convert this radiation into electricity. The ef fi ciency of the \nconversion is a function of the cell material, with conversion ef fi ciency rates ranging    \nfrom 20 % for Silicon to 35 % for the best multijunction Ga-As cells. The actual \nef fi ciency of the solar array    will be reduced by physical factors such as the percentage \nof the solar array size that is actually occupied by cells \u2013 normally from 80 % to \n90 %, and the angle between the solar array and the actual direction of the Sun. Aging \ncells and cell working temperatures will also reduce ef fi ciency. Taken all together, \nsolar arrays    at 1 AU and aligned to the Sun will generate from 150 to 300 W per m 2  \nof surface. The solar array\u2019s structural components are the same as those described in \n\n\n\n319The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\nSections  10.1.1  (structures   ),  10.1.2  (thermal dissipation), and  10.1.3  (deployment and \npointing    mechanisms   ). \n\n The external surfaces of the satellite, which would be illuminated by the Sun   , can \nbe covered with solar cells   . This will be the simplest cheapest and most reliable type \nof solar array   . Those solar arrays    are called \u201cbody mounted.\u201d The power provided by \nthe body mounted solar array    is limited by:\n\n   The size of the available external surfaces.  \u2022 \n  The variable geometry of the Sun    with respect to the surfaces covered by cells.  \u2022 \n  The operating temperature of the body mounted cells, which being mounted over \u2022 \nthe satellite body cannot radiate heat easily and could become too hot.    \n\n All these factors will limit the total power that these arrays could provide. \nNevertheless, these solar arrays    are used extensively in small- and moderate-size \nsatellites that do not require large amounts of operating power and where simplicity \nand low cost    are and important design drivers. \n\n The satellite\u2019s solar power needs governs the selection of cell material, array size, \ndeployment approach, and Sun   -tracking geometry. The satellite\u2019s power require-\nments    will be discussed in Section   11.1.1    . The solar array    size, deployment approach, \nand Sun-tracking    geometry will be shaped by the accommodation constraints gener-\nated by the launcher    fairing volume and the overall satellite con fi guration   . As the \nsolar array is commonly a large pointable, deployable structure   , the fundamental \ntrade-off    will be similar to that of the previous section: complications for the mecha-\nnisms    versus complications for the rest of the satellite. The choice will be between a \ncomplex but small, ef fi cient, and light solar array, and a simpler but heavier and larger \none. Deployable solar arrays    suffer from all the problems typically associated with \nlarge deployable structures    and mechanisms. However, their design drivers are usu-\nally very similar for each mission, more than for other large deployables, and the use \nof existing quali fi ed designs is a feasible option. In that case the selection and accom-\nmodation of the solar array can be left completely in the hands of the specialist. In \ncases where available space makes that dif fi cult, alternatives include: the designing \nof a dedicated solar array compatible with the constraints, the allocation of a larger \nproportion of the available volume to the solar array, or the use of a launcher with a \nlarger fairing size. All three of these alternatives have clear shortcomings. In this \nsituation, the architect    possesses the best overall perspective for choosing the opti-\nmum way ahead. \n\n With the exception of solar array    size and its impact on satellite con fi guration    most \ndesign decisions for this subsystem    can be safely put in the hands of the specialists. \nThere are no dramatic differences between the distinct design alternatives, and imple-\nmentation of the satellite could be reasonably undertaken using different approaches; \nfor example, with either regulated or unregulated buses    or with different types of \ncells. The availability    of already quali fi ed components and the supplier   \u2019s experience \nwill be fundamental in orienting the design in one direction or another. \n\n In many cases, and taking into account that the solar array    is a large, physically \ncontinuous assembly with complex a numerous mechanical interfaces with the satel-\nlite, it becomes a small subsystem    that is delivered directly to the satellite\u2019s supplier   , \nwho must take account of any structural dynamic impacts it may have of platform and \npayload performances.   \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n320 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    10.2.   The external environment as con fi guration driver \n\n This section complements Section   9.2     of the previous chapter by describing the \nenvironments and analyzing the impact of each external environment    on the space-\ncraft\u2019s con fi guration   . \n\n    10.2.1.   Launcher \n\n The launcher    drives the con fi guration    because it determines:\n\n   The volume available for accommodating the stowed con fi guration    and the shape \u2022 \nand size of the interface between the satellite and the launcher     \n  The launch loads    and the resulting stiffness    and strength    requirements    that will \u2022 \nde fi ne almost all the structural elements  \n  The allowable satellite launch mass and the location of the satellite center of masses    \u2022 \n\n The selection of available launchers is limited, and programmatic constraints    \u2013 for \nexample, that the launcher    shall be from a speci fi c country \u2013 limit it even more. This \nmakes launchers a major design driver. Satellites cannot be designed without reference \nto a launcher, and in fact the design must begin with reference to one or \u2013 preferably \u2013 \nseveral launchers, and design the satellite to  fi t all of them. \n\n    10.2.1.1.   Volume limitation \n The launcher fairing   , whose shape is cylindrical-conical with rotational symmetry \nabout the launch axis, will limit the volume available. It is universally acknowledged \nthat spacecraft design is driven by the importance of reducing weight, but it is equally \ntrue that the need for compactness drives the stowed con fi guration of a satellite, and \nin the design of LEO    satellites volume limitations often come before weight limita-\ntions. To answer volume allocation issues, there are three possible strategies: the use \nof a launcher providing larger fairing, thus providing more volume; the use of deploy-\nment mechanisms   ; or the judicious use of the available volume by optimizing the \nsatellite\u2019s shape. All three strategies have limitations: larger launchers are more \nexpensive; even the cleverest solutions to volume limitations may not ultimately \nwork; and the use of deployable mechanisms    is risky and expensive. The importance \nof volume limitation in the design of satellites can be clearly seen in the stowed \ncon fi guration    of Sentinel-3    (Section   9.6.1    ) as shown in Figure  10.2 . The instruments   , \nantennas, and stowed solar array    are clearly located for compactness and maximum \nuse of the volume provided by the launcher. In some extreme cases the shape of the \nlauncher determines totally the shape of the satellite. \n\n Snapdragon    (Figure  10.3 ) is an EADS-Astrium patented con fi guration    that opti-\nmizes the use of the launcher    volume when employing a large planar array antenna \non the satellite. The satellite is divided into two half-hexagonal sections that  fi t \nperfectly into the cylindrical space provided by the launcher. Once launched the two \nhalves deploy around a common hinge and produce a deployed con fi guration    allowing \na large  fl at surface where the largest planar array antenna compatible with the \nlauncher volume can be located. The con fi guration also aims for minimum deployment \nmechanism complexity for maximum antenna size. The interaction between satellite \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n321The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\nshape and launcher envelope    becomes even more complicated when several satellites \nare launched simultaneously. In some cases the satellites must be designed with spe-\ncial shapes and supplementary structural adapters must be provided to connect all the \nindividual satellites to the top of the launcher. An example of the accommodation of \na constellation of mini-satellites carrying radar altimeters can be seen in Figure  10.4 . \nEight satellites in two rows of four can be accommodated inside the volume provided \nby the launcher. The shape of the mini-satellites is entirely governed by the accom-\nmodation constraints, and a large central beam for attaching all the mini-satellites \nmust also be accommodated.   \n\n The Iridium    constellation, introduced in Section   9.6.3     and discussed further in \nSection  10.3.4 , is an extreme case of con fi guration    accommodation to a launcher    \nenvelope.

Some launchers provide specialized \nservices for the simultaneous launch of two or three different satellites in a single \nlaunch and with minimal shape constraints and with minimal interface problems \nbetween them. To provide this service, the space under the launch fairing is split into \ntwo or three clearly separated envelopes, each one with an independent interface with \nthe launcher. This double or triple con fi guration is used extensively for communica-\ntion satellites    into GEO    orbits    (Figure  10.6 ).    \n\n    10.2.1.2.   Stiffness    and strength limitations \n During launch, the launcher    will transmit vibrations    and accelerations to the satellite \nstructure:\n\n   The launcher    thrust    will generate an intense slowly changing acceleration along \u2022 \nthe axis of thrust, which corresponds with the longitudinal axis of the stowed satel-\nlite. Figure  10.7  provides an illustration of the chronology of these accelerations.   \n\n  Figure 10.4.

Depending on satellite location and frequency range, some of the vibrations \ncaused by acceleration will be damped and others will be ampli fi ed.

Launcher mass limit \n Injection into different orbits requires different levels of energy and the mass injection \ncapability    of a launcher    is dependent on the required orbit. The energy needed to place \nsatellites into orbit is also a function of the terrestrial location of the launch center. \nLaunch installations near the Equator    are more ef fi cient because they add \u2013 free of \ncharge \u2013 the rotational velocity of the Earth    to the energy injected into the satellite. \n\n Figure  10.8  provides comparisons of the accommodation and launch mass con-\nstraints for the same mission using two different launchers: Vega    and Rockot   . The \nsatellite, which is a proposed concept for an atmospheric chemistry-monitoring \nmission, needs to  fl y at an altitude of 820 km with an inclination of 96\u00b0. Vega can \nplace about 1,450 kg into that orbit, while Rockot can place around 1,150 kg. Vega \nwill be launched from Guyana, near the Equator   , and can directly launch in the right \ndirection northwards toward the Atlantic. The Rockot launcher    possesses very \nsimilar characteristics, but is launched from Plesetsk, Russia, at 62.7\u00b0 northern lati-\ntude. Unlike launches from Guyana, in order to avoid problems with falling \nlauncher parts, Plesetsk can only launch to very speci fi c orbit inclinations, as indi-\ncated in the  fi gure. These launch site    limitations must be taken into account when \ndesigning a space system.    \n\n    10.2.2.   Load environment \n\n Satellites confront mechanical loads    throughout their lives. The satellite con fi guration   , \nand especially its structure, must be able to withstand these loads without suffering \ndegradation that could compromise the ful fi llment of the mission\u2019s objectives. The \nloads are produced: on the ground, during launch, and in orbit. \n\n    10.2.2.1.   On the ground \n On the ground, before launch, the satellite will be handled and transported. This \ninevitably produces stresses and strains on the satellite. On the ground, transporta-\ntion and assembly jigs called \u201cmechanical ground support equipment   \u201d must be \ndesigned and built to support and protect the satellite and its components during \nhandling and transportation, thus ensuring that the on-ground loads    environment \ndoes not become a design factor for the satellite\u2019s structure. The terrestrial transpor-\ntation and handling environment, however, differs greatly from that in-orbit; for \nexample, during assembly the top part of the satellite might hang from slings \nattached to a transportation crane, while during launch the satellite will be clamped    \nto its base. This could cause the on-ground environment to become a design driver \nfor some special parts of the satellite. The structure must also guarantee easy assem-\nbly and disassembly in order to access and eventually refurbish any component \nlocated inside the satellite. The satellite assembly process is long and complex, \nrequiring many assembly and disassembly operations, and the easier and faster the \nassembly, the cheaper will be mission costs. This need for accessibility forbids \nstructural solutions that could have provided superior strength    with low mass but \nthat might be incompatible with easy accessibility   . Figure  10.9  depicts the assembly \ncon fi guration    of the Thales-CNES Proteus    platform. Clearly, the concept provides \neasy access, thus minimizing assembly costs and delays.   \n\n\n\n325The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\n    10.2.2.2.

The owner of the launcher transforms the launch \naccelerations into a set of strength    and stiffness    requirements imposed on the satellite \nthat wants to use his launcher. These requirements include:\n\n   Quasi-Static accelerations    along and transverse to the direction of launch. Quasi-\u2022 \nstatic means that the acceleration change slowly enough to be treated as static by \nthe designer.  \n  Sinusoidal accelerations   , along and transverse to the direction of launch.  \u2022 \n  Acoustic noise    level as functions of the frequency.  \u2022 \n  Satellite\u2019s allowable longitudinal and transversal stiffness   .

In the case of Vega 1  and Rockot 2  their \nuser manuals specify the maximum accelerations along and transversal to the  fl ight \ndirection for the three stages of the launcher   , both static and dynamic (Table  10.1 ):  \n\n Vega    speci fi ed the low frequency longitudinal and transversal sinusoidal accelera-\ntions    as 1 g at the base of the spacecraft in the 2\u2013100 Hz frequency range. Rockot    \nspeci fi es values in the 5\u2013100 Hz range from 0.8 to 1.5 g in the longitudinal direction \nand 0.6 g in the transversal one. For noise levels Vega speci fi es 145 dB in the \n20\u20132,000 Hz range. Rockot speci fi es 142 dB in the 20\u20134,000 Hz range. \n\n  Figure 10.9.

For this reason, the launch-\ners also specify minimum stiffness   . Rockot    requests that the  fi rst lateral natural fre-\nquency of the satellite be larger than 15 Hz and forbids longitudinal resonances in the \nrange 16\u201333 3  Hz. Vega    4  requires lateral frequencies higher than 15 Hz and longitudinal \nfrequencies higher than 35 Hz. The speci fi cations    above will be transformed into load \ncases for the stress analysis    and in test cases for the primary structure    of the satellite. \n\n The speci fi cation for the secondary structure    include:\n\n   Sinusoidal acceleration    pro fi les  \u2022 \n  Stiffness    requirements    for individual components  \u2022 \n  Random vibration acceleration    pro fi les    \u2022 \n\n Based on the design and stiffness    of the secondary structure   , and the fact that the \nsatellite will amplify the launcher    accelerations, ampli fi cation factors need to be \ntaken into account. To cover for all the possible ampli fi cation factors, the launcher \ndocumentation or the speci fi cation of the satellite provides (Figure  10.10 ) worst-case \n\n  Figure 10.10.

This speci fi cation \napproach is easy to use because the only data needed is the mass of the item being \nsupported by the secondary structure. It is also conservative enough to be used in the \npreliminary design.   \n\n    10.2.2.3.   Test loads    \n Test loads    are intended to demonstrate that the satellite is able to withstand launch \nstresses. Test loads are designed to envelope the worst-case real launch loads    multi-\nplied by speci fi ed safety margins   ; so in a well-implemented mission, tests will expose \nthe hardware to the worst environmental stresses that it will ever experience, and the \nstructure will actually be designed to withstand test standards. Test loads are de fi ned \nin the speci fi cations    applicable to the satellite mechanical environment. \n\n In order to validate the primary structure    against quasi-constant accelerations, the \ntest consists of:\n\n   Either, the application of static forces onto the structure with hydraulic actuators     \u2022 \n  Or, sinusoidal accelerations    generated by vibration shakers       \u2022 \n\n Tests for the validation    of the primary structure    against dynamic accelerations \ninclude:\n\n   Simulation in acoustic chambers    of the noise environment at launch  \u2022 \n  Sinusoidal testing in vibration shakers       \u2022 \n\n The use of an acoustic noise    is particularly applicable to a spacecraft that carries \nlightweight appendages having relatively low mass per unit area, such as large stowed \nsolar array    panels. Tests for the validation    of the secondary structure    are carried out \non vibration shakers   . The tests verify stiffness   ; resistance against sinusoidal accelera-\ntions   ; and resistance against random vibration   .  \n\n    10.2.2.4.   Loads in orbit \n The in-orbit environment    generates four types of mechanical loads   :\n\n   Thermoelastic loads generated    by the varying in-orbit temperatures expanding or \u2022 \ncontracting the structural components of the satellite  \n  Deployment loads    generated during the recon fi guration of the satellite, including \u2022 \nend-of-deployment shock loads  \n  Loads generated in the deployed con fi guration    by large or small attitude or orbit \u2022 \ncorrection    maneuvers  \n  Loads generated by the centrifugal  fi elds of spinning satellites       \u2022 \n\n In-orbit, the load environment is low and does not affect the primary structure   \u2019s \ndimensioning. Nevertheless, in-orbit loads    can be a factor in dimensioning large \ndeployable structures and mechanisms    like antennas or solar arrays   . Large deployable \nstructures    dominate any satellite con fi guration    in which they are present. This makes \ntheir early analysis and design a crucial step. The whole JWST    con fi guration \n(Sections   7.2.1    ,   8.3.2    , and  10.3.3 ) turns around the deployable mechanisms    of its \ntelescope    and its sun-shield.   \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n329The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\n    10.2.3.   Thermal radiation environment: Sun   , Earth    and deep space \n\n In space satellites will encounter four sources of thermal radiation:\n\n   The Sun   , which can be considered a black body    at 5,800 \u2022 5  K. At 1 AU the \nenergy of the Sun is 1,367 W/m 2 . The effects of the Sun were introduced in \nSection   9.2.4    .  \n  Sunlight re fl ected back into space from the Earth   \u2019s surface. The fraction of sun-\u2022 \nlight re fl ected by the Earth is called albedo   . Earth\u2019s albedo is highly variable, \noscillating from 5 % to 100 %, but its average is 30 %. 6   \n  Earth   -emitted thermal radiation. The Earth can be considered a black body    at \u2022 \n288 K. The average energy emitted is 230 W/m 2 , but depending on the temperature \nof the Earth\u2019s surface it can  fl uctuate from 150 to 350 W/m 2 .  \n  Cosmic microwave radiation    produced by deep space    can be considered a black \u2022 \nbody at 3 K.    \n\n Planck\u2019s Law    (Figure  10.11 ) controls the relationship between the temperature of \na radiation source and its wavelength   . The Sun\u2019s radiation    peaks at 0.4  m m; the \nEarth   \u2019s peaks at 10  m m; and radiation from deep space    peaks at 1.9 mm. Satellites \nproduce heat as a by-product of electrical energy utilization and they dissipate this \nenergy by interchanging thermal  fl ows with the Sun, the Earth, and deep space. \nSatellites will radiate heat according to the temperature and the properties of its \ndifferent external surfaces. The thermal control    components of the satellite must keep \nthe satellite within temperature ranges required for its correct functioning, and they \nmust do this within the changing geometry caused by the orbit of the satellite \nthroughout the year. To ensure adequate functioning, most satellite components must \nbe maintained at ambient Earth temperatures, around 290 K. The satellite\u2019s radiative \nheat interchange    with the Sun, Earth, and deep space will depend on their angular size \nin the celestial sphere    around the satellite. The geometry of the Sun, Earth, and deep \nspace around the satellite was discussed in Section   9.7    .  \n\n The position of the Sun    and Earth    changes according to the satellite\u2019s orbit and \nattitude and can be affected by the season of the year. The angular size of the Sun and \nEarth will also change if the distances to them change with the orbit. The satellite\u2019s \ncon fi guration    speci fi cations    and thermal design    must take into account the changing \nthermal environment as de fi ned by the changing geometry of the satellite with respect \nto the Sun, the Earth, and deep space   . Section  10.4  will systematically examine the \nmost adequate con fi gurations for different types of orbits and attitudes. The satellite\u2019s \nsurface will contain a number of dedicated thermal radiator    areas, while the rest of \nthe surface will be thermally isolated from the environment. The radiator areas shall \nbe positioned to provide the required heating    and cooling    levels for the satellite and \nall its parts and in all the speci fi ed satellite attitudes and orbits. The space mission \nplan must avoid excessive variations in the radiators\u2019 orientation.  \n\n   5   Spacecrafts Techniques and Technology, Volume 3 Chapter X.3.3.2.2, CNES Cepadues Editions.  \n   6   ECSS   -E-10-04 A Chapter 6.3.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n330 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    10.2.4.   Space environment generated external forces and torques \n\n The in-orbit con fi guration    of the satellite will be driven by the forces and torques gener-\nated by the external in-orbit environment   . There are four sources of forces and torques:\n\n   The neutral atmosphere    (Section  \u2022  9.2.3    ): orbital drag and lateral winds  \n  Radiation pressure    (Section  \u2022  9.2.4    )  \n  Gravity-gradient torques    (Section  \u2022  9.2.1    )  \n  Magnetic  fi eld induced torques    (Section  \u2022  9.2.2    ).    \n\n According to Figure   9.2    , the satellite\u2019s orbital altitude and solar activity    are the most \nimportant factors affecting the upper atmospheric density    and the consequent resulting \nforces and torques on the satellite. Variations in altitude or solar activity will produce \ncorrespondingly high variations in the aerodynamic forces    and torques on the satellite. \n\n The satellite con fi guration    and  fl ight attitude directly affects its cross-sectional \narea    normal to the velocity vector    that together with the atmospheric density    and \norbital velocity determines the forces and torques    on the satellite. \n\n The lower the altitude the more signi fi cant these con fi guration    drivers become. All \nsatellites orbiting below 1,000 km and requiring precise orbit control    need orbit main-\ntenance    to counter aerodynamic drag. In the 500\u20131,000 km altitude range an average-\nsized satellite only needs to carry moderate amounts of fuel, so the impact on the \ncon fi guration will be modest. However, if the orbit altitude    is lower and if the satellite\u2019s \ntransversal area is large, the amount of fuel needed for orbit maintenance becomes \nsigni fi cant with respect to the satellite\u2019s overall mass, and reduction of the satellite\u2019s \ntransversal area becomes an important con fi guration driver. An extreme case is GOCE    \n(Figure  10.14 ), which  fl ies at an altitude of 250 km, where the minimization of \n\n  Figure 10.11.    Emission and Absorption at Different Temperatures (ESA ECSS   ).       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n331The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\ntransversal area is the most important con fi guration driver. Snapdragon    (Figure  10.3 ) \nand Starlette    (Figure   9.7    ) are also examples of satellites with a con fi guration that \nminimizes the effects of external forces. \n\n As shown in Figure   9.2    , during the 11-year solar activity    cycle, atmospheric den-\nsity    changes by two or three orders of magnitude. This makes aerodynamic forces    \nmuch stronger during solar maximum    than during solar minimum   . Satellites in LEO    \norbit often require repetitive coverage and revisit    orbital patterns (Section   9.9.3    ). \nThese kinds of missions \u2013 and any other LEO mission that require strict orbital con-\ntrol    \u2013 will specify the maximum acceptable difference between the nominal and the \nactual orbit. To ful fi ll this requirement, the atmospheric drag    must be compensated \nfor by more or less frequent orbital correction maneuvers   . These maneuvers will be \nmuch more frequent during the solar maximum phases than near solar minimum, \ncomplicating the operations of missions with large transversal areas during solar \nmaxima. Hence, con fi gurations that are perfectly acceptable during solar minimum \nphases become unacceptable during solar maximums. The cross-sectional area    of the \nsatellite might also change during the life of the mission, introducing a supplementary \nfactor of variability in the aerodynamic forces. \n\n The pressure produced by the radiation of the Sun    and by the ever-changing solar \nwind    is small but continuous, and this small torque can produce a cumulative effect \nthat needs compensation. This effect becomes a con fi guration    driver for satellites in \nthe geostationary position. GOESS    (Figure   7.2    ) carries a \u201csolar sail   \u201d that must be \ndeployed far away from the satellite body to compensate the radiation pressure gener-\nated by the single-wing solar array    of the satellite. \n\n The force of gravity    acting on different parts of the satellite varies. This produces \na \u201cgravity-gradient   \u201d torque that makes the satellite align along a minimum potential \nenergy direction \u2013 generally with the satellite\u2019s longer dimension pointing    to Nadir   . \nThis torque is used for simple and inexpensive attitude control   , but in some missions \nthe preferred attitude and con fi guration    does not coincide with any minimum energy \ndirection and the gravity-gradient exerts a constant torque on the satellite. Most of the \ntime this torque is trivial and can be easily compensated for by the satellite\u2019s attitude \ncontrol actuators   . The exceptions are satellites with large deployable structures and \nattitudes that generate high gravity-gradient torques   . This means a geometry that is \nneither along the local vertical or the local horizontal. An example is the P-band \nsynthetic aperture radar (SAR   ) depicted in Figure  10.12  that carries a 12 \u00d714.7 m \nlarge deployable parabolic antenna    (LRA). 7  Satellites with large deployable append-\nages orbiting in LEO    must always consider external forces and torques in deriving \ntheir con fi gurations. Satellites with large deployable structures    in LEO will be \naffected by atmospheric drag    and by torques exerted by the gravity-gradient.   \n\n    10.2.5.   Electromagnetic radiation environment \n\n Satellite con fi gurations must be compatible with the external and self-induced radia-\ntion environments. Section   9.2.6     introduced the natural radiation environment   . This \nenvironment contains energetic particles that could damage the satellite components. \nProtective metal layers are used to shield these components. \n\n   7   Courtesy from Thales Alenia.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n332 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n Satellites include electromagnetic radiation    emitters and receivers. The emitters \nare often powerful and the receivers can be very sensitive. This means there is a risk    \nof the satellite emitters affecting the receivers and generating error signals. To avoid \nthis, the design process    should include a frequency interference analysis    to identify \nthe power of the emitters and the sensitivity of the receivers at different frequencies. \nThe gain patterns of the emitting and receiving antennas, the distance between them, \nand the possible existence of corners or edges between the emitting and receiving \nantennas, will all play a role in the quanti fi cation of this problem. Simulation tools \nexist that can predict this effect, but it is a phenomenon dif fi cult to calculate and the \nsimulation tools employ large safety margins   , often leading to overdesign. To reduce \nthe electromagnetic interference    problem the emitting and receiving frequencies need \nto be separated, and frequencies that could have close emitting and receiving harmon-\nics, even when well separated, need to be avoided. Antennas with sharp radiation \npatterns will also mitigate the problem. If feasible, the receiver can be designed to be \nturned off when a potentially contaminating emitter is active. \n\n In some cases it is necessary to provide deployable mechanisms    to separate the radia-\ntion source from the detector. Ulysses   \u2019 5.5 m radial boom (Figures  10.17  and   8.10    ) sepa-\nrates the sensitive instruments    located on it from the radiation produced by the \nradioisotope thermoelectric generator    used by Ulysses and from the magnetic  fi elds \ngenerated by the satellite electronics   . A related issue is the reception by the receiving \nantenna of signals coming from two sources: one from the direction of the event under \nobservation and another re fl ected off nearby surfaces of the satellite. This effect is known \nas multipath    and will produce error signals from the receiving instruments. The NASA-\nCNES radar altimetry    mission Topex-Poseidon determined the satellite\u2019s position by \nmeasuring the distance to GPS    satellites; but GPS signals could bounce off the satellite\u2019s \nown body before reaching the antenna, thus producing a satellite position error. To avoid \nthis problem, Topex-Poseidon, as did Ulysses, located the GPS antennas on top of a \n5.5 m long boom away from the satellite\u2019s body.

The \nimpact on satellite con fi guration is typically the need to accommodate a solar array    \nsized to cope with the degraded cell performance experienced at the end of the mis-\nsion\u2019s life. The physical effect of ions, meteorites, or space debris    is normally minor \nand is evaluated through mathematical models. In some cases, this particular environ-\nmental hazard can become an important design factor. GOCE   \u2019s velocity-facing exter-\nnal surface, which receives the direct impact of atomic oxygen ions contained in the \natmosphere at 250 km, is coated with layers resistant to erosion by them. Satellites \n fl ying through an especially dusty environment \u2013 near comets, for instance \u2013 could \nrequire special protective structural layers, ESA\u2019s mission Giotto was an example of \nthis. Giotto carried a special shield to protect the satellite from the particles around \nHaley comet nucleus. 8  Of course, satellites are not designed to withstand impacts \nfrom substantial pieces of space debris as the energies involved are so high. Instead, \na preventative approach is employed, in that predictions of the likelihood of such \ncollisions occurring are made whenever possible, and suf fi cient fuel is carried to \nproduce the necessary orbit maneuvers required to avoid the collision. The conse-\nquences for spacecraft con fi guration are the need to accommodate a suf fi ciently large \nfuel tank   .   \n\n    10.3.   Con fi guration examples \n\n    10.3.1.   GOCE    \n\n    10.3.1.1.   Mission aim \n GOCE   \u2019s 9  mission is to map Earth\u2019s gravity     fi eld with unprecedented accuracy and \nresolution. This will improve our understanding of the Earth\u2019s internal structure and \nprovide a more reliable reference for ocean and climate studies, including sea-level \nchanges   . The gravitational  fi eld    is measured by monitoring the differential fall rate of \nsix different masses located within the satellite. The lower the satellite\u2019s orbit, the \nhigher the resolution and accuracy of the gravity  fi eld determination. This requires as \nlow an orbit as possible. A Rockot    launcher    launched the mission in 2009 and it is \n fl ying above Earth at an altitude of 260 km in a Sun-Synchronous    orbit, at 6:00 local \ntime    and with an inclination of 96.5\u00b0. The mission life    includes two gravity-sensing    \n6 month periods that are eclipse   -free, each separated by a period of 4 months with \neclipses    when the satellite is dormant because the eclipse environment is not compat-\nible with the smooth acquisition of gravity data. Its mass is 1,100 kg, 200 kg allocated \nto the gravity-sensing instrument.  \n\n    10.3.1.2.   Con fi guration \n The intense drag forces the satellite withstands due to its low orbit in fl uences its \ncon fi guration   , which is designed to provide the smallest transversal section possible, \nthus minimizing atmospheric drag   . The satellite is shaped like an aircraft, with \n\n    8    ESA achievements, BR-250, ESA 2005.  \n   9   ESA Achievements, ESA BR 250, ESA 2005.  \n\n\n\n335The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\n wing-like solar arrays    and a rudder-like structure located at the wake    end of the \nsatellite. It features a pair of electric ion-thrusters   , also located at the trailing end of \nthe satellite, to compensate for atmospheric drag and avoid orbit decay. The ion-\nthrusters   \u2019 power demands require the largest possible solar array   , which in addition \nmust be rigid in order to minimize gravitational perturbations on the sensitive accel-\nerometers   . To attain these two con fl icting attributes, the solar array is designed to \noccupy the entire launcher    space, and is able to provide up to 1.3 kW. The rudder-like \nsurfaces are provided to act like wind vanes adding passive attitude stability to the \nsatellite. This con fi guration is made possible by the Sun-Synchronous dawn dusk \norbit    and by the craft\u2019s attitude. This attitude and orbit means the Sun is always nearly \nperpendicular to the satellite\u2019s orbital plane    (Figure   9.37b    ). One face of the satellite \nis always facing the Sun and is covered by solar cells    (Figures  10.14  and  10.15 ).   \n\n The opposite face, which has a permanent view of cold space   , is used for thermal \ndissipation (Figure  10.16 ). The satellite\u2019s minimal transversal cross-section points \npermanently in the direction of travel, allowing minimal drag. The internal \ncon fi guration    (Figure   9.15    ) is dominated by the gravity   -gradient    sensing instrument, \nlocated near the center of gravity of the satellite in order to minimize gravity pertur-\nbations. GOCE   \u2019s instrument axes must be oriented with respect to the Earth   \u2019s. The \ninstrument makes any internal load path for GOCE impossible, and the primary struc-\ntures    are the craft\u2019s external panels. Thick transversal  fl anges, which are also used to \naccommodate the satellite\u2019s components and electronic boxes, reinforce this external \nprimary structure   . The thermal control    is made up of a multilayer insulator, optical \nsurface radiators, electrical heaters,    and thermistors for temperature measurement. \nGOCE\u2019s electronics    boxes are distributed within the different transversal  fl anges of \nthe satellite. GOCE being slender and with one of its two lateral faces always pro-\ntected from the Sun   , all electrical paths to the thermal radiators on that face are short. \nThe battery is thermally isolated and located on the leading edge side of the satellite. \n\n  Figure 10.14.

To do so, the instrument\u2019s primary structure is built of ultra-\nstable carbon-carbon    composite and is isolated from external thermal variations. \nTo achieve this isolation, the gravity-sensing accelerometers dissipate their thermal \nenergy into a chamber, which in turn dissipates its energy into a second, thermally \ncontrolled chamber that  fi nally transfers the heat to radiators located on the anti-Sun \nface of the satellite. The solar array    edge that faces Earth holds the communications \nantenna    while the edge facing the Zenith    holds the GPS    satellites\u2019 navigation antenna.    \n\n  Figure 10.15.

Ulysses    \n\n Section   8.3.5     explained the aims of Ulysses    while Section   9.6.2     discussed its orbit \nand attitude control    systems. This section will examine its con fi guration   . \n\n Ulysses    is spin-stabilized    and rotates at 5 rpm around the axis de fi ned by the \nantenna\u2019s boresight   , which always points toward Earth   . Ulysses is a  fl at, square satel-\nlite dominated by a 1.65 m diameter large-gain communications antenna    and by a \nradioisotope thermoelectric generator    that is used to produce electrical energy. Ulysses \nalso possesses four deployable booms    supporting and performing experiments. The \n5.5 m \u201cradial boom\u201d and the two 75 m long wire booms    deploy in directions perpen-\ndicular to the rotation axis   , their stability aided by the satellite\u2019s centrifugal  fi eld, while \nthe 7 m \u201caxial boom\u201d is deployed along the rotation axis. This makes demanding \nrequirements    on the stiffness    and alignment of the latter boom. \n\n Ulysses    was launched atop a set of stages \u2013 IUS    and PAM    (Figure   9.27    ). PAM \nprovides a classical structural interface through the base of the satellite; IUS offers \ndirect supplementary support for the heavy radioisotope thermoelectric generator    \n(RTG). Ulysses is a small satellite with a total mass of just 370 kg, with 55 kg allo-\ncated to the payload. The RTG initially provided 284 W (Figure  10.17 ).  \n\n The axial boom is formed by a prestressed, coilable elastic Cu-Be tube anchored \nin the axial-boom drive mechanism located on the anti-Sun    face of the spacecraft. \nThe boom was deployed to a length of 7.5 m by traction force via a set of rollers \ndriven by a stepper motor. The satellite\u2019s structure (Figure  10.18 ) is box-shaped and \nmade from aluminum. The primary structure    consists of four longerons; a main plat-\nform for the satellite\u2019s electronics    boxes; and connection struts for the antenna, the \nradioisotope thermal-electric generator and the external faces of the satellite.  \n\n Ulysses   \u2019 high-gain antenna face always points toward Earth   . The spacecraft\u2019s \norbital parameters makes the direction of both the Earth and the Sun    roughly coinci-\ndent, so the side opposite the high-gain one, facing away from the Sun, is suitable for \nthermal dissipation. In keeping with this geometry, thermal blankets protect the sunlit \nantenna side, while the opposite side holds the thermal radiator   . Ulysses\u2019 thermal \ncontrol    is realized in conjunction with an internal/external power dump that either \nheats the internal parts of the satellite or dumps excess heat to the outside to compen-\nsate for the varying solar inputs.  \n\n    10.3.3.   JWST    \n\n The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST   ) was introduced in Section   7.2.1     and dis-\ncussed further in Section   8.4.2    . The present section will describe the satellite\u2019s \ncon fi guration   . Both sections already discussed brie fl y its structure and con fi guration. \n\n The two main considerations shaping JWST   \u2019s con fi guration    are: the necessity to \nprovide a telescope    with an aperture larger than the launcher   \u2019s payload fairing    diameter; \nand the need to keep the telescope cooled to extremely low temperature in order to \nachieve the required sensitivity. The  fi rst requirement calls for a deployable primary mir-\nror for the telescope; the second requires that the telescope be continuously protected \nfrom the direct radiation produced by the Sun   . From the chosen orbit the Sun and the \nEarth    are in roughly the same direction, and one side of the satellite always points \ntoward them while the opposite side faces outer space.

Its deployable solar array    and \nhigh-gain communication antennas    are prominent. As for the spacecraft\u2019s attitude, the \nsolar array is  fi xed and always facing the Sun   , whereas the high-gain communication \nantennas must point at Earth    with high accuracy and need pointing    mechanisms   . \nBecause of its large and complex deployable structures    and mechanisms, the stowed \nand deployed con fi gurations of JWST    are quite different. Figure  10.21  depicts the \nstowed con fi guration   . The deployment steps are depicted by Figure   8.7    . The principal \ndesign driver of the stowed con fi guration is the Ariane   -5 fairing envelope. JWST has \nbeen clearly designed to take full advantage of all the space available inside the fairing, \nto allow stowing an instrument with the largest aperture compatible with the launcher   .   \n\n    10.3.4.   Iridium    \n\n Section   9.6.3     introduced Iridium    and provided a description of the satellite\u2019s orbit and \nattitude. The present section will focus on the constraints driving the design of \nIridium\u2019s con fi guration   . \n\n Iridium   \u2019s central portion is long and slender, of triangular transversal shape; its \nelongated section is orientated along the Nadir    direction, providing supplementary \nstabilizing gravity   -gradient    torque 10  with a pair of solar arrays    deployed perpendicular \nto the Nadir line. The vehicle is 4.06 m long and the solar array    is 8.38 m from tip to tip. \nThe total mass of each satellite is 725 kg, and their power delivery capacity is 620 W \neach, though the power subsystem    can handle power peaks as high as 4,000 W. \n\n The slender triangular shape is determined by the need to accommodate numerous \nsatellites in a single launcher    by stacking them in parallel along the launcher\u2019s longi-\ntudinal axis while still providing each satellite with individual interfaces with the \nlauncher. Each satellite is divided into three modules:\n\n   The upper part contains the satellite\u2019s general platform services, including power \u2022 \nand solar arrays.   ;  \n  The middle section includes the payload electronics    and provides interfaces with the \u2022 \nthree L-band    square- fl at array antennas linked with the mobile ground telephone.  \n  The lower one includes the Ka-band    antennas and associated electronics   .    \u2022 \n\n  Figure 10.21.

The two  fi xed links are for contact with satellites ahead and behind in \nthe same orbital plane   , while the two pointable antennas are for contact with satel-\nlites in lateral planes to the right and left.  \n  Three large L-band    antennas (MMA of Figure  \u2022 10.22 ) for contacting ground-\nlocated hand-held telephones. They require clear views in a large cone around the \nNadir    direction.   \n  The satellites\u2019 con fi guration    is also strongly in fl uenced by their orbit, featuring an \u2022 \ninclination of 86\u00b0, with the Sun    drifting seasonally around the satellites\u2019 orbital \nplane   . As a result of this drift   , exposure of the satellites\u2019 and their solar arrays    to \nsunlight vary constantly with the orbit and the changing seasons (Section   9.7.1     and \nFigure   9.33    ). To compensate for this, each solar array    is equipped with two point-\ning    mechanisms   : one with a rotation capability of 360\u00b0 that continuously tracks the \noptimal solar position along the orbit, and another with a rotation capability of 90\u00b0 \nthat regularly adjusts itself by small increments so that the  fi rst mechanism can \nmaintain the solar array perpendicular to the Sun at all times. This varying \ngeometry is discussed in detail in Section  10.4.1  and Figure  10.29 .    \n\n As already indicated in Section  10.2.1 , the satellites\u2019 con fi guration    allows maxi-\nmum launch  fl exibility. Their elongated triangular shape allowed for ef fi cient and \nsimultaneous accommodation of  fi ve or seven units in Delta    and Proton    launchers. \nThe design is also compatible with smaller launchers in cases where a malfunction in \n\n  Figure 10.22.

The geometry around the satellite and the con fi guration \n\n The geometry of the celestial sphere    surrounding the satellite, including the Sun   , the \nEarth   , the Moon   , observation targets, and deep space   , is highly variable and depends \non the satellite\u2019s orbit and attitude and the nature and direction of the observable   . This \ncomplex and variable geometry was discussed thoroughly in Section   9.7    . The present \ndiscussion will begin with the geometries analyzed there and will describe and \nexamine the con fi gurations that have been adopted in response to these geometries. \nThe number of possible geometries is numerous, and the potential con fi gurations \nresponding to them are even more abundant. This section will consider a large selec-\ntion of alternatives that have been employed in the past. The outline of this section \nwill follow that of Section   9.7     with regard to the types of satellites studied: Nadir-\npointing   , rotating, inertial, and agile. \n\n    10.4.1.   Nadir-pointed satellites \n\n    10.4.1.1.   General \n A satellite pointing    to Nadir    always has one of its faces permanently pointed to the \nplanet being orbited. This face is the most suitable location for the instruments    \nobserving the planet due to the unobstructed view it offers of the planet\u2019s surface. In the \ncase of Earth   -orbiting satellites this face is also the most logical location for com-\nmunication antennas    between Earth and the satellite. The satellite rotational speed \nwith respect to inertial space    of one turn per orbital period    is low, the resulting in-\norbit centrifugal accelerations are weak and Nadir-pointing    satellites can use large \nand slender deployable structures    providing a high level of deployed con fi guration    \nfreedom. Nadir-pointing satellite con fi gurations can be as simple as the square box of \nSSTL\u2019s DMC    (Figure   11.10    ) or as complicated as the P-band SAR    with a 12 m diam-\neter aperture parabolic antenna    depicted in Figure  10.12 .  \n\n    10.4.1.2.   Sun   -synchronous satellites \n Sun-synchr   onous orbits were introduced in Section   9.4.1    , and Section   9.7.1     and \nFigures   9.35    ,   9.36    , and   9.37     studied their resulting geometry. This type of satellite is \nwidely used because it enjoys the important advantages already discussed: fairly \nconstant solar illumination of both the satellite and observable, and full Earth    cover-\nage. The LEO    Nadir   -pointing    Sun-synchronous    satellite is a typical Earth observation    \nsatellite. The Sun\u2019s position with respect to the satellite is de fi ned by the spacecraft\u2019s \nlocal time    (Figure   9.35    ), and the con fi guration    of the solar array    and the satellite as a \nwhole is strongly dependent on the local time. The satellite\u2019s movement along its \norbit allows it to access the orbited body\u2019s surface \u201calong-track,\u201d and Sun-synchronous    \nsatellites are ideal for surveying Earth from pole-to-pole with Nadir-pointing    instru-\nments   .

Sentinel-3\u2019s in-orbit con fi guration    has \na deployable solar array on the Sun side, radiators on the opposite, deep space    \noriented side and its instruments and communication antennas    directed at Earth \non the Nadir-oriented face. This is the typical con fi guration for Earth-observing \nSun-synchronous satellites (Figure  10.23 ). The optimal geometry of the solar array \ndepends on the geometry of the Sun and is de fi ned by the cant angle between the solar \narray plane and the rotation axis    of the solar array. The optimal cant angle of the rotating \nsolar array depends in turn on the angular position    of the Sun with respect to the \norbital plane   ; that is, on the local time of the orbit (Section   9.4.2    ). Sentinel-3  fl ies at \n10:00 local time and the  b  angle (Figure   9.33    ) axis of the cone described by the Sun \nalong one orbit oscillates between 22.5 and 33.5\u00b0 (Figure   9.36a    ). The resulting \noptimal cant angle providing maximum solar energy will be around 28\u201330\u00b0.  \n\n NPOESS    (Section   12.3.4     and Figure   9.15    ) is a constellation of meteorological \nsatellites providing systematic observation    of the atmosphere and their con fi guration    \nis exactly the same as Sentinel-3   \u2019s, with a prominent Nadir   -looking face for instru-\nments    and antennas, a Sun    side for the solar array,    and an anti-Sun side for radiators. \nThe con fi guration of the satellites\u2019 body is identical in each of the three satellites, \nwith the exception of the solar array cant angle, which is different in order to optimize \nthe geometry of the solar array with respect to the Sun\u2019s direction: 22.5\u00b0 for the 13:30 \nsatellite, 72.5\u00b0 for the 17:30 satellite, and 37.5\u00b0 for the 21:30 orbit (21:30 local time    \nis equivalent to 9:30 local time from the point of view of Sun-satellite geometry). \nThat means the satellite orbiting at 17:30 will have a large cant angle with a solar \narray geometries similar to Figure  10.24a  and the satellites orbiting at 21:30 and the \n13:30 will have a small cant angle similar to Figure  10.24b .  \n\nDeep Space\n\nNadir = Earth\n\nVelocity\n\nCant\nangle\n\n  Figure 10.23.

Each one of the two identical instruments obtains images of 60 \u00d7 60 km \nwith spatial resolutions of 2.5 m to 10 m. The two instruments can be used to provide \nwider coverage, or two stereoscopic, nearly simultaneous views of the same target. \nThe mirror-pointing mechanisms    allow viewing of targets within \u00b127\u00b0 across-track \nto the Nadir direction. Spot  fl ies with a local time    of the descending node    of 10:30. \nIts solar array    cant angle is 22.5\u00b0; that means the solar array and the solar array rotation \naxis    are both close to perpendicular to the orbit plane (as in Figure  10.24b ).  \n\n Besides the obvious similarity of its con fi guration    to that of Sentinel-3   , there is a \nfundamental difference: Spot     fl ies with the longitudinal axis of the satellite perpen-\ndicular to the velocity vector   , while Sentinel-3  fl y with the velocity vector parallel to \nthe longitudinal axis of the satellite. This makes the \u201cbottom\u201d of Spot 5 the Sun   -\noriented face, and the solar array   , once deployed, is located in that area. The anti-Sun \nside of Spot is totally occupied by the two instruments   . This position favors thermal \ncontrol    and protection from the Sun. The platform radiators are located on the three \nlateral faces, which consecutively receive sunlight along the orbit; the resulting ther-\nmal conditions, however are suf fi cient for heat dissipation    of the satellite\u2019s platform    \ncomponents. Transversal  fl iers    like Spot have a more symmetrical inertial matrix, \n\n  Figure 10.24.     Optical Solar Array    Cant Angle for Different Local Times   . ( a ) For Local Times \nat 8:00 (Sun    Never Far Away from Perpendicular to Orbital Plane   ) and ( b ) for \nLocal Times at 10:00 (Sun Never Far Away from the Orbital Plane).       \n\n \n\n\n\n345The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\nwhich provides some advantages for attitude control   , but longitudinal  fl iers    like \nSentinel-3 have ample space to accommodate instruments requiring open views of \ncold space   . This additional space is especially valuable for missions  fl ying several \ninstruments that need very low temperature cooling    and that will be competing for the \nlimited available space. Most modern Earth    observation missions carry several of \nthese instruments, making longitudinal  fl iers a better option as regards easy instru-\nments accommodation. NASA\u2019s Aura (Figure  10.41 ) is another example of longitu-\ndinal  fl ier. \n\n Most LEO    Sun-synchronous    missions carrying passive optical instruments    orbit at \naltitudes between 500 km and 1,000 km and in order to provide effective solar image \nillumination they avoid local times    around 06:00. In these conditions satellites will \nexperience one eclipse    per orbit with a duration slightly over one third of the orbital \nperiod    (Figure   9.38a    ). This requires a corresponding increase in size of the solar array    \nin order to absorb enough sunlight for the batteries    to remain charged and provide \npower to the satellite during the periods of eclipse. \n\n GOCE    (Section  10.3.1  and Figure  10.14 ) is another Nadir   -pointing    satellite in \nSun-synchronous    orbit   , but as it requires no sunlight for its observations it has a local \ntime    of 6:00. In this case, rotation of the solar array    to provide a reasonable geometry \nwith respect to the Sun is unnecessary (Figure   9.37b    ). GOCE uses this to its advantage, \nand features a  fi xed solar array with wings solidly attached to the satellite. The 6:00 \norbit offers brief or no eclipses    (Figure   9.38b    ), affording ef fi cient energy production \nwith minimum-size  fi xed solar arrays    and it is especially suitable for SAR    satellites. \nESA\u2019s Sentinel-1, DLR\u2019s Terrasar-X and the Canadian Radarsat-1 and ?2 are good \nexamples of this con fi guration   . Sentinel-1 (Figure  10.26 ) is an operational C-band \nSAR satellite. It features two deployable solar arrays that do not need to rotate \n\n  Figure 10.25.

SAR\u2019s    are side-viewing \ninstruments    and Sentinel-1\u2019s C-band SAR, along with the satellite\u2019s body, are \npointed 30\u00b0 away from the Nadir, though the communication antenna is aimed \ndirectly toward it.  \n\n Deployable, rotating, Sun-tracking    solar array    \u2013 as depicted in the previous  fi gures \u2013 \nprovide an optimal orientation for the solar cells    and ensure optimal power with mini-\nmal solar cell area. Nevertheless, low cost   , small satellites    require normally modest \namounts of power and they can be compatible with simple con fi gurations where the \nsolar cells are attached to the external sides of the satellite body. In this case the satel-\nlite con fi guration    becomes just like a central body, for example, a cube, without any \ndeployable solar arrays   . The different body mounted cells will be progressively illu-\nminated by the Sun as the satellite moves around its orbit. The cubic, body mounted \nlow cost SSTL DMC    satellite depicted in Figure   11.10     is an example of this.  \n\n    10.4.1.3.   High-inclination non-Sun-synchronous satellites \n In the case of non-Sun-synchr   onous orbits the Sun will shift widely with respect to \nthe orbital plane   . This affects the lighting conditions    of the scene under observation \nand complicates the orientation geometry of the solar array   , which needs to face the \nSun, and of the thermal radiators, which need to avoid sunlight. To provide the neces-\nsary electrical energy there are four possible alternatives:\n\n    1.    A  fi xed solar array    whose solar panels    are pointed in several directions, so that they \nare able to capture enough solar energy whatever the direction of the Sun   . The \npanels shall be correspondingly overdimensioned.  \n\n    2.    A single-axis rotating solar array    that tracks the Sun    as accurately as possible, large \nenough to provide the required energy. This is only effective for moderately \ninclined orbits.  \n\n    3.    Solar array tracking mechanisms    that provide two distinct rotation axes allowing it \nto track the Sun    wherever its relative position to the satellite.  \n\n  Figure 10.26.

The ability of the satellite as a whole to rotate with respect to the Yaw   /Nadir    direc-\ntion, combined with a solar array    featuring a second rotation axis   , allowing the \nsolar array to remain always perpendicular to the Sun   .     \n\n Solution 1 was adopted by ESA\u2019s Cryosat    (Figure  10.27 ); solution 2 by CNES-\nISRO\u2019s MeghaTropiques    (Section   8.3.4     and Figure  10.28 ); Iridium    (Section  10.3.4  \nand Figure  10.29 ) adopted solution 3 and ESA\u2019s Galileo    (Figure  10.30 ) adopted solu-\ntion 4. The following discussion will analyze each one of these cases.     \n\n  Figure 10.27.    Cryosat    Con fi guration    (ESA   www.esa.int    ).       \n\n  Figure 10.28.

At such an inclination, the satellite\u2019s orbital plane    is almost  fi xed in \ninertial space   , and the Sun    orbits once per year around that plane. During some sea-\nsons the Sun will be perpendicular to the orbital plane and will illuminate the satellite \nlaterally from a fairly constant position along the orbit. During the seasons when \nthe Sun lies in the plane of the orbit, it will rise over the Earth   \u2019s horizon and illumi-\nnate the satellite\u2019s trailing face; as the satellite proceeds along its orbit, the Sun will \nmove toward the spacecraft\u2019s Zenith   , and will  fi nally set below the Earth\u2019s horizon \n\n  Figure 10.30.    Galileo    Con fi guration    (ESA Achievements, BR-250, ESA 2005).       \n\n  Figure 10.29.     Iridium    Sun    and Earth    Geometry Along the Seasons. ( a ) In a Season with the \nSun Close to the Orbital Plane   . ( b ) In a Season with the Sun Close to the \nPerpendicular to the Orbital Plane. In Each Season, the Solar Array    Cant \nAngle Is Adjusted for Optimal Solar Array Illumination.       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n349The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\nwhile illuminating the satellite\u2019s leading edge side. To cope with this complex and \nvarying geometry, Cryosat possesses  fi xed solar arrays    located above the tent-like \nanti-Nadir    face of the satellite. The radar altimeter    and communications antennas \noccupy the Nadir-facing side. The angle and size of the two Zenith faces, where the \nsolar arrays are installed, are optimized to provide similar solar energy production \nwhether the Sun lies in the orbital plane or is perpendicular to it. The solar array   \u2019s \nef fi ciency will never be very high but given the availability    of space the energy pro-\nduced is perfectly adequate to meet the satellite\u2019s needs. The NASA-DLR GRACE    \nmission has the same orbit and satellite con fi guration   . \n\n The principal objective of MeghaTropiques    is the study of the tropical water cycle. \nIn order to maintain its orbit over the tropics, so maximizing its scienti fi c mandate, it \n fl ies at an orbit inclination    of 20\u00b0. The two wing solar array   \u2019s rotation axis    is perpen-\ndicular to the orbital plane    and rotates uniformly at one turn per orbital revolution. \nThe Sun    revolves around the orbital plane, but being a low-inclination orbit    the angle \nof the Sun with respect to the solar array will be as indicated in Figure   9.41     with the \nSun angle always at a moderate angular distance of the orbital plane. \n\n Iridium    orbit inclination    is very close to 90\u00b0, and the sunlight can reach the satel-\nlite from almost any direction. To permit communication between Earth    and the \nsatellite, Iridium must maintain a  fi xed geometry with respect to the ground; and it \nmust maintain a constant geometry around Yaw    in order that each satellite in the \nconstellation can establish contact with the satellites  fl ying around it. This means that \nit is necessary to provide a solar array    with two rotation axes:\n\n   One, which rotates from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 to provide an optimal canting angle. This actuator \u2022 \noperates in small increments to accurately track the seasonal variations of the \nSun   \u2019s position with respect to the orbital plane    of the satellite.  \n  A second one that tracks the Sun    by uniformly rotating 360\u00ba during each orbit.    \u2022 \n\n Section   8.4.7     looked at missions in which the satellite can rotate freely with \nrespect to the instruments   \u2019 line of sight   . Radar altimeter missions fall into this cate-\ngory. Galileo    is a constellation of 27 European navigation satellites\u2014plus three in-\norbit spares \u2013 placed in three circular orbit planes at an altitude of 23,222 km and an \ninclination of 56\u00b0. Galileo emits navigation signals that allow receivers on the Earth    \nto determine their geographical location by calculating the distance \u2013 determined \nfrom the delay time of the signal \u2013 from the ground receiver to the emitting satellites. \nThe application allows rotation of the instrument around its line of sight that coin-\ncides with the Nadir    direction. This results in a con fi guration    with two solar arrays   , \neach one with one rotation axis   . The combination of this single rotation mechanism \nand the ability to orientate the satellite around the Nadir allows the solar array    to be \ncontinuously oriented toward the Sun   . Radiators are on the faces where the solar \narrays are stowed and are always perpendicular to the Sun. \n\n In non-Sun-synchr   onous orbits the Sun rotates seasonally around the satellite\u2019s \norbital plane    and successively illuminates each of the satellite\u2019s sides. To avoid sun-\nlight reaching the radiators the satellite can perform seasonal yaw- fl ip    maneuvers \n(Figure   9.40    ) around the Nadir    direction when the Sun crosses the orbital plane. This \nprevents direct solar illumination of one face, and is a practical option for locating the \nradiators because the frequency of the  fl ip is low and the resulting operational constraint    \nis perfectly acceptable.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n350 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    10.4.1.4.   Low-inclination orbits \n As depicted in Figure   9.41    , in low-inclination orbits    the angle between the ecliptic and \nthe equatorial plane    is moderate and solar arrays    rotating on an axis perpendicular to \nthe equatorial plane will be reasonably well placed with respect to the Sun    along the \nentire orbit and throughout all the seasons. Given a cubic central body    for the satellite, \nfour of the six faces will be illuminated by the Sun (Figure  10.31 ) while two will remain \nin shadow. These two dark faces are the logical place for locating radiators. This is the \ncase for all low-inclination orbits either LEO    or GEO   . Section   9.4.4     introduced geosta-\ntionary orbits   . The combination of these useful orbits with a Nadir-pointing    attitude \noffers continuous coverage of extensive areas of the Earth   . This combination is fre-\nquently employed for communication and Earth observation    missions.  \n\n The instruments    pointed to the Earth    shall be designed to minimize the effect of \nthe sunshine on them. This could be done by minimizing the scanning of the instru-\nments outside the Earth\u2019s disk, by using an optical baf fl e to shadow the entrance of \nsunlight to the instrument or by providing shutters that will cut the light penetrating \ninside the instruments. When this shutter is activated the instrument cannot operate. \nThis situation has been already depicted in Figure   9.43    . \n\n The con fi guration    of the geostationary meteorological satellite GOESS    (Figure \n  7.2    ) is a good example of this kind of satellite. GOESS\u2019s instruments    are located on \nthe Nadir    face and are protected from sunlight by baf fl es   . One of the two sides not \nilluminated by the Sun    contains the radiators and the other carries a single-wing solar \narray   . To compensate for the disparity produced by the pressure of sunlight on the \nsolar array, the thermal radiator    side features a deployable solar sail    that is positioned \nby a boom far from the radiators, minimizing any thermal effects the solar sail might \nhave on them. \n\n Meteosat Third Generation (MTG   ) will be the future European geostationary \nmeteorological satellite. The  fi nal design is not yet settled, but all con fi guration    alter-\nnatives have elected a Nadir-pointing    attitude. One design features a symmetric \narrangement of solar wings (Figure  10.31 ). This is made possible by the use of active \nmechanical coolers that reduces the instrument detectors\u2019 working temperature with-\nout the need for a perfect view of cold deep space   . The trade-off    between complex \nmechanical coolers and complex con fi guration is treated with more detail in \nSection  10.5.4  (Figure  10.32 ). Most communication satellites    that need their \ncommunication antennas    to be aimed toward Earth    share this Nadir-pointing GEO    \nattitude. The most common con fi guration for communication satellites features two \nsymmetric solar arrays   . The Alphasat    (Figure  10.33 ) provides a good illustration; it \ncarries symmetric solar wings and the Nadir   -oriented face is occupied by antennas \nwhich also occupy \u2013 when stowed \u2013 the two lateral faces that are also lit by the Sun   . \nThe two faces perpendicular to the solar arrays, which are never illuminated by the \nSun, are used for the stowage of the solar array    during launch and as radiators once \nin orbit. The bottom face of the satellite is used to attach it to the launcher   .     \n\n    10.4.2.   Spinning satellites \n\n The attitude control    for spinning satellites    was introduced in Section   9.3.3     and the \nresulting geometry around the satellite in Section   9.7.2    . This section will examine the \nimplications on satellite con fi guration    of selecting a spinning satellite (Figure  10.34 ).  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n351The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\n Satellite faces perpendicular to the rotation axis    will be  fi xed on an inertial refer-\nence frame   , while faces parallel to the rotation axis will see the celestial sphere    rotat-\ning rapidly around them. The most important element in fl uencing the con fi guration    \nof a spinning satellite is the centrifugal forces    generated by the rotation. These forces \nwill produce loads on any deployable structure    required by the satellite. Deployable \nmechanisms    are dif fi cult to accommodate on spinning satellites    unless they deploy \n\n  Figure 10.31.

The rotation axis also determines a cylindrical \nsymmetry    around itself. This cylindrical symmetry  fi ts naturally into the cylindri-\ncal symmetry of the launcher    fairing, leading to cylindrical satellites that will make \nef fi cient use of the volume provided by the launcher. The communication satellite \nAnik C    (Figure  10.35 ); the meteorological satellite MSG    (Figure   7.3    ); and the Earth    \nmagnetosphere    mission Cluster    (Section   11.4.1     and Figure  10.34 ) are examples using \nthis con fi guration.  \n\n Spinning satellites are simple, stable, and as indicated above, make an ef fi cient use \nof the volume provided by the launcher   .

But in cases where mis-\nsion aims are compatible with these limitations, the con fi guration    is very effective. \n\n Satellites performing in situ    observations are not constrained by the pointing    direc-\ntion of the instruments    and a spinning con fi guration    can be an attractive option. \nUlysses    (Section  10.3.2 ) is a good example of this kind of satellite. Ulysses has \nmechanisms    deploying perpendicular to the rotation axis   : the 70 m wire booms    and \nthe 5 m rigid hinged boom are deployed and stiffened by the centrifugal  fi eld. The \n7 m axial boom is deployed along the rotational axis and any misalignment will be \nbent by the centrifugal forces   , which increase as the de fl ection of the boom increases. \nThis puts demanding requirements    on the stiffness    and alignments of this boom. In \nfact, during the mission\u2019s  fi rst days, the axial boom developed oscillations caused by \ncentrifugal forces and the heat of the Sun   . The oscillations produced dangerous nuta-\ntion    in the satellite\u2019s spin, but as soon as the Sun stopped shining on the axial boom \nthe oscillations disappeared, and the boom has been behaving normally ever-since. \n\n Cluster    is another good example of a cylindrical spinning satellite performing in \nsitu    observations. It has two pairs of 100 m wire antennas and two 5 m long radial \nbooms, all deployed perpendicular to the rotation axis   . The con fi guration    was \ndesigned to launch the four satellites of the Cluster constellation on Ariane   -5\u2019s \nmaiden voyage. Sadly, that  fl ight failed and two Soyuz-Fregat    rockets subsequently \nlaunched the constellation, each carrying a stack of two satellites. The satellites\u2019 abil-\nity to  fi t perfectly into the cylindrical launcher envelope    is evident (Figure  10.34 ). \n\n The Cluster    constellation orbits Earth    in an extremely elliptical high altitude orbit \nwith an inclination of 90\u00b0. At this inclination the orbital plane    is  fi xed in the inertial \nreference frame    and the Sun    rotates around the orbital plane once a year. The rotation \naxes of the satellites are perpendicular to the ecliptic plane   , and the rotating cylindrical \n\n  Figure 10.35.

This is an optimal attitude for producing electrical energy. The top and \nbottom of each satellite never receive direct sunlight and the thermal radiators are \nlocated there where they can provide heat dissipation    ef fi ciently into deep space   . \n\n As mentioned above, the pointing    of spinning satellites    is in fl exible, but there is \none orbit where this is not a major problem: the geosynchronous orbit   . A GEO    spin-\nning satellite, with the rotation axis    perpendicular to the orbital plane    and the instru-\nment boresight    perpendicular to the rotation axis, will scan along the Equatorial \ndirection of the Earth   \u2019s disk during 17.4\u00b0 of the 360\u00b0 of each rotation. This provides \neast\u2013west scanning of the Earth without the need for any mechanism   , though north\u2013\nsouth scanning would still require a mechanism for full Earth coverage. MSG    \n(Figure   7.3    ) is an example of this type. The main disadvantage of this arrangement is \nthat observations can only be made during 17.4\u00b0 of the satellite\u2019s 360\u00b0 rotation; this \nradically reduces observations time as well as the strength    of the signal collected by \nthe instrument. To compensate for this reduction in strength, a larger aperture instru-\nment is required. \n\n From the point of view of satellite con fi gurations and celestial sphere    observing \ngeometry, communication satellites    are Earth-observ   ing satellites. Their antennas \nmust point toward Earth in order to receive and retransmit the corresponding data \nstreams. Anik C    is a good example of a communications satellite with a cylindrical \ncon fi guration   . Anik C was a Canadian communications satellite built by Hughes \n(now Boeing); three satellites were built and launched from 1983 to 1985. The satel-\nlite featured a cylindrical telescopic solar panel to increase the area available for the \ncollection of solar power. It had a high-gain parabolic antenna    on the topside that \ncounter-rotated the satellite\u2019s spin and pointed continuously toward Earth. The \ncon fi guration provided good pointing stability    and ef fi cient use of the volume offered \nby the launcher   . The satellite\u2019s diameter was 2.16 m; its stowed height 2.82 m; and \nits deployed height 6.43. Its mass in the GEO    position was 562 kg. \n\n During the 1970s and 1980s this con fi guration    was used extensively for GEO    \ncommunications and meteorological satellites but today it is not common. Advances \nin attitude control    and large deployable structures   , coupled with the need for greater \npower, pointing  fl exibility,    and payload performance have made this con fi guration \nnearly obsolete.  \n\n    10.4.3.   Inertially pointed satellites \n\n Inertially pointed    satellites are ideal for observing events located above the celestial \nsphere    and in deep space   ; as such, inertially pointed    satellites are generally astronomy \nsatellites. All examples discussed in this section are astronomical missions. Angular \naccelerations    in the deployed con fi guration    are low and there is ample freedom for \ndesigns employing satellites with large, slender, deployable structures   , if needed. \n\n Inertially pointed    satellites can point in any direction, and the positions of the Sun   , \nthe Moon   , the Earth    (for data downlink    and commands uplink   ), and potential obser-\nvation targets are highly variable. This makes the con fi guration    of the satellite much \nmore open than for Nadir-pointing    or spin-stabilized    satellites. In inertially pointed    \nsatellites, the con fi guration must be able to balance the need for accurate pointing; \nobservation of the astronomical events being studied; adequate exposure to sunlight \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n355The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\nfor electric power   ; exposure to deep space    for heat dissipation   ; and Earth visibility \nfor communications. The Sun\u2019s position must be considered not only for the location \nof the solar array    and the thermal radiators but for the pointing of the instruments    as \nwell. Astronomy instruments are very sensitive and will not generally tolerate direct \nsunlight on them. \n\n Section   7.2     provided an introduction to the interactions between the principal \ndesign drivers of space missions: observable, orbit, and attitude. Since all the mis-\nsions examined in Section   7.2     are inertially stabilized   , that chapter also provided an \nintroduction to the con fi guration    of inertially stabilized satellites. Speci fi cally, Section \n  7.2.2     analyzed the fundamental design drivers for these kinds of satellites, and the \npremises of that analysis are applicable here. In those examples the con fi guration was \ngoverned by the telescope   \u2019s need to withstand the launch load environment    while \nproviding a large telescope aperture    and accurate pointing    by the instrument    in the \nsatellite\u2019s deployed con fi guration   .  \n\n    10.4.4.   Agile    satellites \n\n This is a special category of satellites whose outstanding characteristic is that they are \nable to rapidly maneuver into any direction required by the mission. All inertial satel-\nlites are agile in the sense that they can be pointed in any direction, but truly agile \nsatellites    are designed to allow swift attitude changes as required by rapidly changing \ntargets. Agile    satellites are especially appropriate for high-resolution observations of \nsmall areas of the Earth    where events worthy of note are developing. Their agility    \nallows them to cover numerous distinct areas of interest   . This ability can also be \nemployed to improve power production; for instance, by maneuvering from a Nadir-\npointing    attitude to an inertial Sun-pointing    attitude so that the solar arrays    are per-\npendicular to the Sun, thus increasing the amount of power generated by the array and \nto recharge the batteries    in the process. \n\n In agile missions the entire satellite points in the direction required by the observ-\nable    and no dedicated instrument pointing    mechanisms    are needed, neither along- nor \nacross-track   . The satellite must be compact and rigid, minimizing inertia and avoid-\ning dynamic couplings between the  fl exible deployables and the pointing of the \ninstruments   . The high-resolution Earth    observation    mission Pleiades    (Section   9.6.4     \nand Figure   9.29    ) is a good example of this kind of mission and of the resulting \ncon fi guration   . The satellite con fi guration is compact, and the telescope    is located in \nthe center of the satellite\u2019s structure. The solar array    is deployable but its panels are \nsolidly attached to the satellite body and have supplementary stiffening stringers to \nmaximize stiffness    and minimize pointing perturbations   . The compact con fi guration \nensures lowest inertia and maximum maneuverability. \n\n RapidEye 11  is a constellation of commercial medium\u2013resolution, small satellites    \nfor Earth observation   . The constellation is made up of  fi ve identical satellites  fl ying \nin a Sun-synchronous orbit   , at 620 km altitude and with a local time    of 11:00 \u00b1 1 h. \nIt provides images in  fi ve spectral bands    with a maximum resolution of 6.5 m. The \nspacecraft can maneuver across-track    by \u00b1 25\u00b0 allowing a daily revisit    over any part \n\n   11  \u201cThe RapidEye\u201d Spacecraft, Gary Buttner, IAA-B4-1105P.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n356 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nof the Earth. The satellite\u2019s mass is 150 kg, with 35 kg allocated to the instruments   . \nThe instrument\u2019s aperture, is 150 mm. The satellite is a cuboid (Figure  10.36 ) without \nany deployable mechanisms   . This minimizes inertia, maximizes agility   , improves \nsatellite reliability, and minimizes cost    and risk   . Being a Sun-synchronous    satellite \nwith almost 12:00 local time the Sun geometry is as in Figure   9.37a    . The solar array    \nis made up of three panels located in the velocity (+X), antivelocity (?X), and Zenith    \n(?Z) sides of the satellite. The Sun, which due to its local time is always very close \nto the orbital plane   , will illuminate sequentially the three panels along each orbit. \nThe instruments and antennae are in the Nadir    (+Z) plane pointing    to the Earth. The \narrangement does not provide an optimal use of the solar cells    but is adequate for \nthe mission and perfectly in line with a simple, robust satellite design approach.    \n\n    10.5.

Volume limitations will compel long satel-\u2022 \nlites to adapt their shape to the \u2013 normally long \u2013 launcher fairing   .  \n  Launcher payload mass limitation. Mass limitations will pressure short compact \u2022 \nsatellites to minimize load path and optimize use of structural mass.  \n  Minimizing axial center of gravity    offset from the launcher   \u2019s payload interface.    \u2022 \n\n The following  fi gure provides the internal structure of Sentinel-3   . The satellite is \ndivided into a lower part for the subsystems and the fuel tank    and an upper part for \nthe instruments   . Launcher fairings are cylindrical-conical and longer than they are \nwide; to take advantage of the maximum volume permitted by the launcher   , satellites \nmust be elongated. Several examples of this have been discussed above: Figure  10.2  \nprovided Sentinel-3\u2019s stowed con fi guration   ; and Figure  10.3  showed that of \nSnapdragon   . In both cases the satellite is elongated and makes the best possible use \nof the volume allowed by the launcher. The con fi gurations of GOCE    in Figure  10.16  \nare also examples of a long satellite. Long satellites allow a natural split of the pri-\nmary structure    into two halves, upper and lower, each part with its own function: the \nupper half to carry the instruments and the lower half to carry the satellite subsystems. \nThe lower part is usually called the \u201cservice module   \u201d and the upper part the \u201cinstru-\nments module.   \u201d This split design has a long history; TD-1, launched by ESA in 1972 \nalready used it. Assembly can be done on both halves of the satellite in parallel and \njoined only when the majority of problems have been resolved in each separate half. \nThis speeds up assembly. A long satellite divided into two parts is the most frequent \ncon fi guration for LEO    missions  fl ying multi-instrument payloads. Figure  10.37  shows \nthe internal structure of Sentinel-3.

The lateral panels accommodate \nthe satellite subsystems and the large central tube provides rigidity, strength    and \nspace for the orbit control    fuel tank. The upper-half primary structure of Sentinel-3 \nis based not on tubes but on panels. The panel-based primary structure allows for \noptimal accommodation of the large, roughly cubic instruments in independent \ncompartments separated by load-carrying panels; this provides maximum use of the \nallowable volume.  \n\n Short satellites are of similar length and width. These satellites provide maximum \ninternal volume for minimal cantilever distance. For the same structural mass, a short \nsatellite will be stiffer and stronger than a long satellite of the same internal volume. \nThis gives a clear structural advantage to short satellites. Short satellites, however, do \nnot make ef fi cient use of the launcher   \u2019s internal elongated fairing volume. There are \ntwo situations in which this is not a shortcoming:\n\n   When a single launcher    is being used to launch more than one satellite  \u2022 \n  For missions orbiting at or above GEO   , where the launcher    mass limitation would \u2022 \nbecome more restrictive than the volume limitation    \n\n Many of the medium and large launchers optimized for GEO    can launch more than \none satellite at a time. In the case of GEO the launcher   \u2019s elongated faring is split \nbetween two or three volumes, each for a different satellite (Figure  10.6 ). These vol-\numes have similar longitudinal and transversal sizes and most medium-size satellites \n fl ying at GEO possess a cubic shape (Figure  10.38 ).  \n\n The high-energy levels needed to thrust    a satellite far from Earth    make mass limi-\ntation, not volume limitation, the principal design driver for the primary structure    of \ndeep space    satellites. Deep space    satellite Rosetta    (Section   11.4.2    ), for example, is \nshaped like a cube; its central body    measures 2.8 \u00d7 2.0 \u00d7 2 m and  fi ts without any \nvolume constraints into the faring provided by Ariane   -5. \n\n  Figure 10.38.

As satellite\u2019s shrink in size, \ntheir stiffness and strength is improved, permitting a reduction of structural material \nthickness. Furthermore, there are minimum practical thicknesses that cannot be fur-\nther reduced. As a result of this small satellites    ful fi ll quite easily structural require-\nments and it is feasible to use structures    that do not look optimal but are perfectly able \nto ful fi ll the structural requirements while optimizing accommodation. The primary \nstructure    of the SSTL satellite provided in Figure  10.39  above is a good example for \nthis type of structure.   \n\n    10.5.2.   Deployable structure    and mechanisms: Fixed versus deployable \n\n The primary structure    de fi nes the stowed con fi guration    for launch and the deployable \nstructure    and mechanisms    de fi ne the in-orbit deployed co   n fi guration. Large deploy-\nable structures    and mechanisms are complex and expensive but they solve the contra-\ndiction between the need for a compact launch con fi guration    and the eventual \nexpanded in-orbit one. If an expanded in-orbit con fi guration    is required, then a large \ndeployable structure will be necessary. Most satellites have large deployable solar \narrays    for collecting the energy required for their operations. Deployable mechanisms \nare also crucial for providing the necessary unobstructed  fi eld of view    needed by \ninstruments    or communication antennas   . Chapter   8     made repeated reference to the \nneed of sensitive instruments for large apertures to detect the frequently weak signals \nrequired for ful fi lling mission aims. If the instrument aperture is larger than that \nallowed by the launcher   , it will require the use of deployment mechanisms   . The \ncon fi gurations studied in Section  10.3  encompass the compact GOCE    satellite, with \nno mechanisms, to JWST    that employs several large deployable structures    and mecha-\nnisms, and each one crucial to the ful fi llment of mission objectives.

Figure   8.12     compared the con fi gurations \nof X- and P-band SAR    satellites, and how the lower frequency P-band satellite \nrequired a very large antenna. Figures  10.12  and  10.40  offer also examples of large \ndeployables, which are vital for ful fi lling the demanding needs of P-band SAR \nobservation. Ulysses    (Figure  10.17 ), which observes electromagnetic waves at low \nfrequency, also employs deployable mechanisms   : the previously mentioned 7 m \nmonopole axial antenna, a 75 m dipole radial antenna, and a 5.5 m radial boom.  \n\n To avoid the problems associated with complex deployment mechanisms   , the use \nof larger launchers is advisable. Launchers    like Ariane    V, Delta   -IV, or the Space Shuttle \nfeature large volumes that will always make the task of accommodating large satellites \neasier; they are all, however, expensive. The choice between using large complex \ndeployables or a large launcher    is always an important trade-off    in the design of \nthe mission architecture. The Herschel    satellite was presented in Figure   7.9    ; it has the \nlargest rigid diameter structure able to  fi t inside an Ariane-5 rocket. Initial designs for \nthe concept that eventually became Herschel \u2013 at that time called the Far Infrared \nSpace Telescope    \u2013 projected a deployable telescope    with the primary mirror in \nsegments, like the petals of a daisy, devised to  fi t inside the comparatively small \nvolume provided by Ariane-4. The ultimate availability    of the larger Ariane-5 \nallowed Herschel to ful fi ll its needs with a single element mirror. The Hubble    Space \nTelescope\u2019s primary mirror size was reduced from an originally envisioned 3 m to a \n fi nal 2.6 m in a trade-off occasioned by the need to  fi t it in one piece inside the Space \nShuttle\u2019s cargo bay. JWST   , on the other hand, includes complex deployment mecha-\nnisms    needed to ful fi ll its very demanding mission requirements   , which require an \ninstrument with much larger diameter aperture than the Hubble\u2019s telescope, and the \n\n  Figure 10.40.

JWST\u2019s mechanisms include:\n\n   Hinge mechanisms    for the primary mirror to adapt its 6.5 m aperture to the 4.57 m \u2022 \ndiameter of Ariane    5.  \n  Mechanisms for situating the secondary mirror in its correct position with respect \u2022 \nto the primary mirror.  \n  An 18 \u00d7 12 m deployable Sun-shield.     \u2022 \n  Mechanisms for increasing the in-orbit separation of the instrument from the satel-\u2022 \nlite platform   . These mechanisms    are necessary to minimize heat leakage from the \nsatellite platform to the instrument.  \n  Deployable radiators, solar arrays    and a pointable high-gain antenna, all located \u2022 \non the satellite\u2019s platform    side.    \n\n These mechanisms    can be seen in Figures   8.7    , 10.20, and 10.21. \n Large deployables also require complex testing procedures. In order to provide a \n\ncredible estimate of the development costs of a large deployable, a detailed design \nmust be provided not only of the mechanisms    but also of test procedures and the \nrequired jigs needed for the testing. Figure  10.40  provides an indication of the com-\nplexity involved in the on-ground deployment of a large, storable parabolic antenna   , \nwhich must simulate conditions in the weightless environment of space. This requires \nthe use of special jigs to compensate, as far as is practical, for Earth\u2019s gravity   . The \ndesign of these tests is complex, risky, and expensive. In most cases the solar array    is \nby far the satellite\u2019s largest deployable. Most of the time the solar array also possesses \ntracking mechanisms to ensure that the largest possible area is exposed to the incom-\ning solar radiation. Modern satellites need large solar arrays    and in most cases that \nmeans they must be deployable. Fortunately, solar array deployment kinematics is far \nfrom complex, and designs can easily be adapted from one mission to the next, thus \nreducing the associated risks. \n\n Recalling the missions described in Section  10.3 : JWST    and Iridium    use deploy-\nable solar arrays   ; GOCE    uses a  fi xed solar array   ; and Ulysses    a radioisotope thermo-\nelectric generator    (RTG) in place of a solar array. GOCE cannot use deployable \ndeployment mechanisms    because their movements would introduce perturbations in \nthe sensitive gravity   -sensing accelerometers   , though its  fi xed, rigid solar array is the \nlargest of this type compatible with the launcher    envelope. Ulysses orbits at a great \ndistance from the Sun   , so a radioisotope thermoelectric generator was selected to meet \nits electrical energy needs. Nevertheless, the use of solar arrays is also viable for \nmissions  fl ying far from the Sun. The Rosetta    satellite \u2013 described in Section   11.4.2     \u2013 \n fl ies at 5 AU during the most important phases of its mission. At that distance the \nenergy produced by its solar array is 25 times less than when  fl ying near to Earth   . \nTo compensate, Rosetta uses a large, elongated solar array, which dominates the satel-\nlite con fi guration    Europe lacks the US technological expertise in RTGs.

Standard platform versus dedicated platform    \n\n It should be pointed out that a satellite con fi guration    is not the same thing as a \nsatellite platform   . A satellite platform, either dedicated or standard, is the sum of a \ncon fi guration \u2013 that is, a mechanical concept and an external shape \u2013 plus an electron-\nics-avionics concept   . It is perfectly possible to design satellites with totally differ-\nent shapes but with the same avionics-electronics concept. The present chapter deals \nwith satellite con fi guration, and will focus on standard platforms   , meaning standard \nstructural concepts and standard shapes. \n\n Standard platforms with the ability to carry different instruments    have been pro-\nmoted as a way to reduce space mission costs for many decades; their actual perfor-\nmance, however, has been mixed. In some cases, they have indeed provided effective \nperformance; while in others their performance has been disappointing. The reason is \nobvious: space missions are extremely diverse and the most dif fi cult part of any mission \nis always the instrument con fi guration    and performance. Standard platforms tend to \nreduce the cost    of the simpler aspects of the mission, \u2013 the satellite structure and \nstandard subsystems \u2013 while complicating the most expensive part of it \u2013 the instru-\nments. Furthermore, the environment of space and the requirements    of the mission \nare also exceedingly varied; so standard platforms    almost always require minor or \nmajor modi fi cations that counterbalance the advantages of the standardization. \nSection   4.11     reviewed the problems that NASA underwent in the 1980s during its \ndrive to standardize planetary exploration. \n\n Nevertheless, a standard platform provides a reference design for the satellite as to \nwhere the different instruments    might be placed, and this can be helpful in many situ-\nations. Standard platforms are effective for satellite families  fl ying very similar orbits \nand carrying instruments with similar demands, such as families of Earth observation    \nsatellites  fl ying in LEO    orbits. NASA 12  used a standard platform for the EOS (Earth-\nObserving System) Terra, Aqua, and Aura, and NOAA will use it for NPOESS   , its \nfuture line of operational LEO meteorological satellites (Figure  10.41 ).  \n\n Both EOS and NPOESS    are based on the T430 platform   , a design by Northrop \nGrumman for missions orbiting Earth    at a moderate altitude \u2013 around 800 km \u2013 and \nin Sun-synchr   onous orbits. The T430 platform has a composite lightweight structure \nthat allows payload maximization and a titanium support surface for instrument \naccommodation  fl exibility. It provides modular interfaces and a standard data bus that \nfacilitates easy accommodation and testing. The platform is compatible with orbiting \nat different local times    with their different Sun and solar array    geometries. This plat-\nform has already demonstrated its  fl exibility for carrying with different instrument \ncombinations. In the case of Terra, the entire satellite weighs 5,200 kg; it carries six \ninstruments    with a total payload mass of 1,100 kg; its solar array provides 2.5 kW; \nand orbits at 705 km at a local time    of 10:33. Terra uses TRDSS    for data relay and its \npresence is quite conspicuous on its con fi guration   . In the case of NPOESS 13  the satel-\nlite will operate in a Sun-synchronous    orbit    at 833 km of altitude at three different \nlocal times: 13:30, 17:30, and 21:30. Because they will carry different instrument \n\n   12   The NPOESS    Spacecraft and Payload Suite, H.

The platform is designed to provide up to 7 kW of power. \nThe different local times de fi ne different Sun and solar array geometries. The standard \nplatform used by EOS and NPOESS has provided good service in space since 1999 \nand will continue to do so for another 10 or 20 years. This record is based on the \nstrong similarity in the demands of the Earth-observing instruments carried by the \nstandard platform implementations to date. Nevertheless, this standard platform has \nevolved in time: the payload space has increased from the 10 m 2  of EOS to the 14 m 2  \nof NPOESS; and its instruments data downlink    approach has also changed. EOS \nsatellites use the TDRSS    data relay satellite    while NPOESS will use a totally different \ndownlink approach that will be discussed in Section   12.3.4    . These are examples of \nthe changes needed to accommodate the different needs of NPOESS and EOS over a \ntheoretically \u201cstandard\u201d platform. \n\na\n\nb\n\nNadir \n\nVe\nloc\n\nity\n\n  Figure 10.41.

This platform has been used in \na variety of applications. Proteus, unlike our previous T430 example, was designed \nto operate at totally different orbit altitudes   , inclinations, and Sun-Earth geometries   . \nProteus is small and can only accommodate a small number of instruments   , in most \ncases just one. Proteus is an Alcatel-CNES concept designed for LEO    payloads in the \n300 kg/300 W class. Its name refers to the Proteus of Greek mythology, a monster \nable to change shape at will, and the Proteus platform has demonstrated the aptness \nof its name by operating in many different orbits and attitudes:\n\n   In the case of Corot, the satellite is inertially stabilized    with an orbit inclined 90\u00b0 \u2022 \nat 900 km of altitude.  \n  In the radar altimetry    mission Jason    it orbits at 1,336 km with 66\u00b0 inclination.  \u2022 \n  In the cases of SMOS and Calipso it operates in a Sun-synchronous orbit, the \u2022 \nformer at 755 km with a local time    of 06:00 and the latter at 705 km and 13:30.    \n\n Proteus   \u2019s capacity for  fl ying in different orbits and attitudes has been demon-\nstrated. Nevertheless, its ef fi cacy with respect to the instruments    is limited and in the \nthree examples presented, an upper \u201cinstrument platform\u201d was required to attach the \ninstruments and which included data processing and data downlink    services, vital to \nthe instruments that Proteus\u2019 basic platform was unable to provide. The successful \nexamples described here were made possible in exchange for one limitation each. T430 \nis able to provide extensive services to many instruments providing the orbit is LEO    \nSun-synchronous   , and Proteus permits a variety of orbits providing the payload \u2013 \npreferably a single instrument \u2013 carries its own services (Figure  10.42 ).   \n\n  Figure 10.42.

Passive versus active thermal control \n\n Satellites must dissipate the thermal energy they produce. The radiators provided for \nthe purpose need clear exposure to cold deep space   . Two conditions are possible:\n\n   The need to cool a satellite\u2019s components to temperatures approximating normal \u2022 \ntemperature on Earth   , around 290\u2013300 K  \n  The need for cooling    to very low temperatures   , from 200 K down to near absolute \u2022 \nzero, depending of the application    \n\n The preferred working temperature for most structures    is ambient temperature, \nwhich minimizes thermoelastic deformation; ambient temperature also guarantees the \nsmooth running of contact surfaces for mechanisms   . Moreover, most surfaces not in \ncontinuous view of the Sun    are capable of adequately dissipating the heat produced \nat ambient temperatures by the satellite\u2019s electronics    boxes. Figures  10.23 ,  10.25 , and \n 10.26  provided examples of varied radiator placement. \n\n The situation changes completely when cooling    to very low temperatures    is called for. \nVery low temperatures are essential for reducing the noise on an instrument\u2019s detectors \n(Section   8.4.2    ). ISO    (Figure   7.7    ) uses liquid Helium    to cool the telescope   \u2019s detec-\ntors to 2 K, while JWST    (Figure  10.19 ) used a combination of passive radiators, Sun    \nshields, and active coolers to reduce the temperature of the detectors to 7 K. JWST\u2019s \ncomplex thermal and mechanical approach facilitates a long mission life   , which is a \nclear advantage for an operational astronomical observatory    of these characteristics. \nThe location of the radiators and the trade-off    between using passive radiators or \nsome kind of active cooler \u2013 mechanical or otherwise \u2013 is always an important deci-\nsion that will have a major impact on the overall con fi guration    of the satellite. Passive \ncoolers increase reliability and mission life but complicate the satellite\u2019s con fi guration. \nFigures  10.31  and  10.32  compared two possible con fi gurations for operational meteo-\nrological satellites   , one with active and one with passive cooling   . The choice between \npassive or active cooling    has major implications, and the decision must be made after \ncareful consideration of all the crucial issues and their impacts at all levels. This need \nfor an end-to-end perspective    plainly puts the decision into the hands of the mission \narchitect   .  \n\n    10.5.5.   Pointing by the instrument    versus pointing by the satellite    \n\n To ful fi ll its mission the satellite\u2019s instruments    must be pointed employing speci fi ed \npatterns. This function can be performed by the instrument or by the whole satellite. \nThis issue was addressed on in Section  10.4.4  when discussing the topic of agile \nsatellites    and was also discussed in Section   8.6.1     and in Figures   8.20     and   8.3    . \n\n Allocating the scanning function    to each individual instrument is the preferred \nsolution for satellites carrying several instruments    all with moderate apertures. In \nthese cases, the pointing mirror    or mirrors will be of moderate size, and the scanning \nfunction becomes the responsibility of each instrument, and thus no longer a major \nconcern for the satellite\u2019s overall con fi guration   . The pointing of each of the instru-\nments will produce internal forces    and torques that will alter the pointing of the other \ninstruments, so it becomes necessary to specify the maximum level of perturbations \nthat each instrument can introduce onto the satellite. The design of all mechanisms    \nmust take into account these maximum perturbation  fi gures. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n366 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n Large instrument apertures make pointing    by movable mirrors or re fl ectors \nimpracticable. It becomes necessary to point the whole instrument, and the most \nef fi cient way to do so is by pointing the entire satellite in the required direction. This \ndemands major con fi guration    adjustments. If pointing is the responsibility of the \nsatellite, the satellite can only point in one direction at a time. This means that either \nthe mission must employ just one instrument or that all the instruments    can point in \nthe same direction without detriment to the mission.   \n\n    10.6.   Allocation of performances \n\n    10.6.1.   Mass budget    \n\n In the early stages of the design, it is necessary to establish an overall mass  fi gure for \nthe satellite and to provide preliminary allocations to the satellite\u2019s subsystems and \ninstruments   . In these stages, the mass of the satellite is not a  fi xed quantity but it \nshould be considered in relation to the anticipated orbit and the launcher    to be \nemployed. As the design matures, the satellite mass    and its orbit will converge into \nvalues that will become requirements    for the space system. In ful fi llment of its mis-\nsion the satellite will require fuel for possible orbital changes   . This will de fi ne two \nmass limitations: dry mass    and wet. Wet mass    is the total mass of the satellite that the \nlauncher will put into orbit and dry mass is the total mass minus the mass of on-board \nfuel. The launcher will be selected to be compatible with the maximum \u201cwet\u201d mass \nof the satellite and the required amount of on-board fuel will determine the remaining \n\u201cdry\u201d mass. The resulting dry mass must be broken down to provide allocations to \nthe instruments and subsystems on board the satellite. During the early stages of \ndesign the following measures could improve the mass margins   :\n\n    1.    Find a minimum mass con fi guration for the mission.  \n    2.    Analyze changes in the orbital path.      \n    3.    Consider a more powerful launcher    allowing higher satellite mass.      \n    4.    Reduce the number and complexity of the instruments   .     \n\n Measure 1 is the optimal one; coming up with a minimum satellite mass    con fi guration    \ndoes not mean reducing the mission\u2019s aims. If measure 1 is unfeasible, measure 2 could \nprovide the solution; a judicious design of the orbit can still ful fi ll mission aims while \nallowing a heavier satellite. Measure 3 implies the use of a more expensive launcher    \nand may not fall within the mission budget. Measure 4 will reduce mission output. \n\n The weighing of options will lead to the identi fi cation of one or more architectures \nregarding orbit, payload, or launcher    choice that could ful fi ll the mission\u2019s aims. \nThese estimations can be used as reference points for the mission\u2019s preliminary \ndesign. In the early stages of design, the mass estimation will not be a bottom-up    \ncalculation but a top-down    one, where the allowable total mass as determined by the \nlauncher must be divided-up and allocated to the different satellite components. The \nadoption of measures 3 and 4 for reducing excessive mass in a mission\u2019s design \nphase \u2013 to either eliminate instrument capabilities or to choose a larger launcher \u2013 \nwill have a major impact on the mission. These options will either reduce the scienti fi c \nreturns or increase costs. Nevertheless, they have the advantage of clarity. It is better \n\n\n\n367The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\nto clearly state that the mission needs a more powerful launcher \u2013 and quote the asso-\nciated supplementary cost    \u2013 than to provide overly optimistic mass estimations that \nare likely to be proven impossible to meet during the industrial phase. \n\n The relationship between dry and wet mass varies greatly depending of the \n mission. Appendix A of Wertz 14  provides the following relations (Table  10.2 ):  \n\n CNES, 15  on the other hand, suggests 6 % of propellant mass for Earth    observation \nand 55 % for a communications satellite with a 15-year life expectancy. The differ-\nence arises from the different rules used by each source to de fi ne what is and is not \nincluded. Wertz often uses as examples satellites with dedicated upper stages that are \nnot considered part of the satellite, which means that the propellant indicated is used \nonly for orbit maintenance   , while CNES bases its estimation on Ariane    intermediate \nGTO   \u2019s orbit (Section   9.4.4    ) and the 55 % of fuel  fi gure includes the fuel needed to \ntransfer the satellite from the highly elliptic    GTO orbit to the GEO    orbit plus the fuel \nneeded or orbit maintenance. In the case of Earth observation   , where the launcher    \nputs the satellite in the  fi nal orbit, the estimations of Wertz and CNES are similar. \n\n The next stage would be to provide estimations for the instruments    and the various \nsubsystems. The literature also offers estimations for preliminary mass allocation. \nBrown 16  and Wertz provide the estimations provided in Table  10.3 . The  fi gures pro-\nvided by both authors are similar and they provide a good base for estimating the \nmass of the traditional subsystems, such as electrical power or structure. Instruments, \nhowever, are usually the most innovative part of any space mission and their mass \ncannot be allocated top-down   , but must be estimated from the bottom-up   , even in the \nearliest phases of the design. This should be possible because, as indicated in \nChapters   7     and   8    , even at the beginning of the design process    there is enough of an \ninstrument concept to allow a rough estimation of the instrument mass   . On the other \nhand, as soon as the design begins to take shape, the top-down mass allocation must \nbe contrasted with bottom-up estimations based on the increasingly more re fi ned \ndesign. As the design matures and advances, the actual mass of a satellite always \nincreases, and it grows more that any reasonable person would think it would.  \n\n Also according to the textbook of Brown, the mass growth of seven NASA missions \nfrom the authorization to proceed with a full- fl edged project to launch was from 10 % \nto 36 % and the average of the seven was 27 %. Unavoidably, as the level of detail of \nthe design increases the mass increases and the individual mass estimations should be \nbalanced with maturity factors    that take into account the uncertainties concerning the \nactual  fi nal mass of the satellite\u2019s instruments    and subsystems. Maturity factors are \nvalues larger than 1 that multiply the best estimation of the mass for the various satellite \ncomponents. As the design becomes better de fi ned, the maturity factors will be reduced \nuntil they become 1 for a fully built  fl ight unit. Different guidelines have been published \nby different sources on the  fi gures to be used as maturity factors. For the early de fi nition \nof totally new designs, the AIAA 17  uses the values provided in Table  10.4 :  \n\n   14   Space Missions Analysis and Design, J. Wertz and W.

The phases are as per Figure   1.6     \nand as per Section   6.3    . The earliest mass estimations of some satellite components are \nconsistently grossly underestimated: secondary structure    and electrical harness are \ntwo examples of this. In addition to maturity factors   , the satellite\u2019s design must \ninclude an overall reserve with respect to the maximum available mass injection \ncapability    of the selected launcher   . The provision of comfortable maturity and safety \nmargins    is vital because mass estimations in the early design stages are always \n\n   Table 10.2.

The need to change the \ninitially selected launcher due to an increase in satellite mass    would have a severe \nimpact on the mission\u2019s overall budget and would jeopardize mission approval. \n\n Advanced structural materials are lighter than conventional metallic ones. Carbon \n fi ber, for example, is now a fully evolved technology and is no longer considered \nrisky. The low thermal expansion    coef fi cient of carbon  fi ber will also minimize ther-\nmoelastic deformations    on satellites employing it, though it always requires metal \ninserts and special structural arrangements to avoid distortions and stresses when \nconnected to secondary structures   , instruments,    or electronic boxes with different \nthermal expansion rates. This means that any reduction of mass in the primary struc-\nture    will be partially offset by increases in masses in other parts of the satellite. The \nmass of connection elements such as nuts, brackets, inserts, and nodes is always \nlarger than predicted and is very dif fi cult to estimate in the early stages of the design, \nbut the mass of all connecting elements is often comparable to the mass of the \nstructural portion of the primary structure. \n\n Some launchers require not only limiting the total mass of the satellite at launch, \nbut also they specify a limited range of acceptable location for the center of masses \nof the satellite. The need to place the center of masses within this required range will \nalso drive the con fi guration    of the satellite. If the mass of the satellite is below the \nlauncher    acceptable limit, it will be possible to add balancing masses until the satel-\nlite center of masses is inside the speci fi ed range. If this is not the case the \ncon fi guration of the satellite should be redesigned to make the concept compatible \nwith both the total mass and the location of the center of masses.  \n\n    10.6.2.   Heat budget \n\n In order for the satellite\u2019s components to function properly, the satellite must be kept \nwithin speci fi ed temperature limits. Satellites are divided into thermal enclosures and \nin each of these the temperature must be kept within the limits speci fi ed for that \nenclosure. To do so, the heat generated in each enclosure must be radiated from the \ncomponents located within it into space at a temperature that ensures the maintenance \nof its speci fi ed temperature range. This balance between thermal production and \nthermal radiation must be guaranteed during all potential phases of the mission, \nincluding safe mode    (Section   9.5    ). For each thermal enclosure this heat budget    shall \nbe balanced by providing a suitable radiative surface of adequate size with respect to \nthe existing  fi eld of view    toward space. The architect    is responsible for designing the \noverall con fi guration   . The thermal specialist will determine the size of the radiators, \ntheir thermo-optical properties    and details concerning the internal thermal paths. The \nnumber of thermal enclosures depends on the con fi guration and on the need to pro-\nvide clear interfaces between the different parts of the satellites. As a rule, each \ninstrument is its own thermal enclosure and has its own radiator or radiators as well \nas its own heaters   . In the case of a satellite divided into a service module    and a \npayload module, each module is designed to be a separate thermal enclosure with a \nspeci fi ed maximum heat transfer between them. \n\n The working temperature for satellite subsystems is de fi ned by guidelines for the \npreliminary design. General-purpose electronics    units located inside the satellite are \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n370 Introduction to Space Systems\n\ndesigned to operate within a 0\u201340 \u00b0C envelope. The batteries    require narrower thermal \nmargins requiring a 0\u201320 \u00b0C range. Components located on the outside of the satellite \nmust be able to work within the wider temperature margins the exterior environment \ninevitably demands; solar arrays    need to deploy in the ?40 to +60 \u00b0C range and with-\nstand ?100 to +100 \u00b0C. These ranges, however, are \u201ctypical guidelines\u201d; a mission\u2019s \nspeci fi c circumstances might require exceeding them; a satellite designed to rendez-\nvous    with Mercury    or Uranus    will need to operate in the especially hot or exceedingly \ncold thermal environments of these planets   \u2019 neighborhoods. \n\n Some instruments have much more demanding temperature control requirements   . \nThe ideal is for them to operate in orbit at, or near to, the temperature at which they were \nbuilt and tested on-ground. These demanding requirements have implications not only \ninside each instrument but also outside them. To avoid thermoelastic distortions    between \ndifferent instruments    pointing    at the same observables   , satellites carrying many instru-\nments need to control the structure supporting them within a very narrow range around \nthe standard ambient temperature of 20 \u00b0C, for example, 18 \u00b0C to 22 \u00b0C. The heat budget    \ninteracts with the power consumption budget    because a radiator requires heating    in cases \nwhen the visibility conditions change, such as during eclipses    or in nonnominal attitude    \nperiods. Heat budgets    require the use of adequate safety margins   . The quali fi cation test-\ning of satellite components requires that they be able to operate in a temperature range \nincluding quali fi cation margins to provide thermal safety margins and also to take into \naccount thermal modeling uncertainty. As heat is produced by electrical power this mar-\ngins will increase power production and the size of thermal heaters   .  \n\n    10.6.3.   Power production budget \n\n In traditional space engineering the power budget is normally a power consumption \nbudget that allocates the power produced by the satellite to all the components that \nrequire it. Yet a power consumption budget    of necessity implies the existence of a \npower production budget   , upon which it depends. That is, a budget comprising the set \nof design decisions that ensures that the size, location, movement capabilities, and \nillumination conditions (including eclipse    durations) of the solar array    are enough to \nproduce the required power and energy. All the main design decisions related to the \nful fi llment of this power production budget are satellite con fi guration    decisions and \nwill be treated here. The \u201cconventional\u201d power consumption budget will be studied \nin Section   11.6.1    . The solar array is one of the most conspicuous components of the \nsatellite structure. The solar array must be large enough to produce suf fi cient energy \nfor the satellite to operate in all foreseeable conditions, and the spacecraft\u2019s \ncon fi guration must be able to accommodate the required solar array size. The three \ncrucial factors for balancing the power production budget are:\n\n   That the solar array    be positioned for maximal exposure to sunlight  \u2022 \n  That the solar array    is able to track the Sun   \u2019s unavoidable changes of position rela-\u2022 \ntive to the satellite  \n  That the solar array    possesses adequate area for energy production while illuminated, \u2022 \nincluding the energy needed for battery charging throughout the mission\u2019s lifetime    \n\n The factors governing solar array    size were discussed extensively in the previous \nsection. Sun    visibility and solar array geometry is thoroughly described Section   9.7    . \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n371The Satellite Configuration Domain\n\nThe  fi nal size of the fully deployed solar array will depend on the satellite\u2019s stowed \ncon fi guration   , which in turn depends on the launcher    size and the solar array\u2019s deploy-\nment concept. Solar arrays are generally standard components with clearly de fi ned \nshapes and whose power delivery capabilities can be increased by providing additional \npanels within the same basic design while ful fi lling the volume constraints presented \nby the launcher fairing   . If both the design of the solar array and the launcher fairing \nvolume permit, providing further power is as simple as adding one or several more \npanel to the same solar array design. Nevertheless, there are limits to the number of \npanels that a given design can carry, and to the number of panels and panel sizes that \ncan be accommodated inside a given launcher fairing envelope. If these limits are \nreached, the addition of supplementary solar array area becomes very problematical \nbecause it will require either major changes to the design of the solar array, the satel-\nlite, or the use of a different launcher. This might be feasible depending on the speci fi c \nsituation, and the provision of energy would become a major design limitation. GOCE    \n(Figure  10.14 ) is a good example of mission design limited by power availability   . The \norbit and con fi guration allows locating all the solar cells    on a  fl at  fi xed surface that is \nroughly perpendicular to the direction of the Sun, thus optimizing electrical energy \nproduction. But GOCE\u2019s mission objectives rule out the use of mechanisms    and its \nsolar array shape and size are strongly limited by the space available within the \nselected launcher fairing. This limitation is absolute, and GOCE\u2019s orbit altitude   , and \nhence its ultimate scienti fi c performance, is a function of the launcher fairing size.  \n\n    10.6.4.   Alignment budgets \n\n Alignment budgets    are true complex budgets involving many aspects of the end-to-end \nspace system \u2013 ground and space \u2013 and Chapter   9     has covered that area extensively. \nSection   9.8     introduced alignment, Section   9.10.6     analyzed pointing   , and Section \n  9.10.8     analyzed co-registration   . These budgets are related to the correct pointing of \nthe instruments    and of the attitude reference frames. However, absolute and relative \npointing are also affected by con fi guration    design decisions, which this section will \nexamine. A list of all the error sources in fl uencing alignment was given in Section \n  9.10.5    . The con fi guration related error sources listed there include:\n\n   Assembly and metrological test errors of structures    and mechanisms     \u2022 \n  Irreversible and permanent changes in alignment between the ground and the \u2022 \nspace environment     \n  Thermoelastic deformation produced by in-orbit thermal variations, outgassing or \u2022 \nmoisture desorption in composite structures   , thermal gradients and by thermal \nexpansion    anisotropies    \n\n The use of highly accurate manufacturing and assembly procedures can reduce \nmanufacturing and assembly errors but higher accuracy manufacturing is always \nassociated with higher costs and a balance must be maintained between manufacturing \naccuracy and cost   . Test equipment, such as metrology tools, will also produce its own \nerrors and, as always, higher testing accuracy will incur greater costs. The realistic \nand accurate test of large deployable structures    is especially dif fi cult and expensive. \nThe dif fi culty of designing proper test jigs for the functional testing of large deployable \nstructures    was touched on in Section  10.5.2 . The test jigs depicted in Figure  10.40  is \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n372 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nclearly complex and expensive. The jigs would become even more expensive if they \nwere required to offer on-ground determination of the in-orbit shape of a large, com-\nplex deployable structure   . In missions that feature large deployable structures, it is \nessential to provide an early detailed analysis of test methods that is detailed enough \nto provide credible estimations of testing costs and test performances including the \nexpected  fi nal deployment accuracy. Strong structures with suf fi cient rigidity and \nstrength    safety margins    will reduce or eliminate any irreversible changes in shape \nproduced by the launch or deployment load environment   . Metals do not change shape \nin a vacuum but organic materials, due to outgassing of water vapor, do. \n\n Thermoelastic pointing errors can be minimized in three ways: by controlling the \ntemperature of the satellite to minimize space and time variations; by using materials \nwith low thermal expansion    coef fi cients; and by avoiding mixing materials that have \nvery different thermal expansion coef fi cients. Any alignment effect that can be prop-\nerly analyzed can be eliminated as far as the quality of the analysis allows it; for \nexample, the difference between in-orbit and on-ground satellite shape can be ana-\nlyzed using structural analysis techniques and using the methods of comparisons \nbetween on-ground and in-orbit alignments, which were described in several sections \nof Chapter   9    . The resulting results can be used to estimate \u2013 and compensate \u2013 the \nalignment errors induced by the lack of perfect knowledge of the deployed in-orbit \nsatellite shape. Thermoelastic analysis can also be used to analyze the elastic varia-\ntions in shape that the satellite will experience in orbit. The calculations can be used \nto compensate for these effects, so that the only remaining alignment knowledge error \nwill be the uncertainty errors in the quality of the thermoelastic analysis. As in the \ncase of permanent pointing errors, in-orbit validation    of actual alignment can be used \nto verify and improve the quality of the thermoelastic analysis.  \n\n    10.6.5.   Volume budget \n\n Mass budgets    are discussed extensively in the literature of space system design; vol-\nume budgets    are not. A mass budget document containing entries for the different \nmasses is produced and updated throughout the process of design, manufacturing, \nassembly, and testing of any space mission; but no such document for volume bud-\ngets exist. Yet volume budgets are just as vital as mass budgets, and in the case of \nLEO    missions are even more essential. Volume budgets are implicit in a satellite\u2019s \nblueprints as well as in its computer generated three-dimensional models. These \nmodels represent \u2013 and implicitly allocate \u2013 volumes and dimensions to the different \ncomponents of the satellite. This volume budgeting becomes explicit when dimen-\nsions and envelopes are allocated to the different instruments    and to any other com-\nponents that require room on the satellite and that will compete for volume and \nvisibility with all the other components around it. \n\n The apportioning of this overall volume will be driven by the con fl icting needs of \nthe different instruments    and subsystem    components both inside and outside the satel-\nlite. All the section of this chapter discussed allocation of volumes and provided \nexamples of satellite con fi gurations that are adopted to optimize volume use. It is the \nresponsibility of the mission architect    to apportion the overall volume to the different \ncomponents of the satellite.         \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n373M.A. Aguirre, Introduction to Space Systems: Design and Synthesis, Space Technology Library 27, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11, \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n           Keywords   Operational Data Flow,   Satellite Ground Segment,   Satellite Operations,  \n Satellite Mission Operational Phases,   Data handling,   Satellite Autonomy,   Systematic \nOperations,   Interactive Operations,   Power Budget,   Link Budgets,   Data Acquisition Delay    \n\n This    domain was introduced in Section   7.1.4    .

The chapter continues with a section that studies this domain by \nanalyzing the design decisions made for four space missions:\n\n   The Earth    magnetic  fi eld mission, Cluster   ; which features a constellation of four \u2022 \nmoderately complicated satellites with moderately complex operations and a low \nlevel of autonomy   .  \n  The comet and asteroids rendezvous    mission, Rosetta   ; which features a complex \u2022 \nsatellite with complex, autonomous operations.  \n  The global land and ocean operational mission, Sentinel-3   ; which features a \u2022 \ncomplex satellite with systematic, simple, and autonomous operations.  \n  The Earth    observation    mission, SSTL Disaster Management Constellation (DMC   ); \u2022 \nwhich features a constellation of six simple satellites, but with interactive \noperations   .    \n\n These missions have been chosen to provide a rich selection of data handling    \nscenarios: featuring both complicated and simple, and autonomous and nonautono-\nmous operations.

Power \n\n The power subsystem    produces, regulates, stores, and distributes the electrical energy \nneeded by the satellite. The power subsystem also directly controls power provision \nto heaters   , pyro initiators, and other key elements that must be able to operate even \nwhen major components of the satellite are disabled. \n\n A large majority of satellites produce electrical energy using the Sun   . Solar cells    of \nSi or GaAs mounted over solar panels    are employed for this. The solar array    frequently \npossesses a system for orientating it toward the Sun; this requires a dedicated mecha-\nnism. Some missions  fl ying far from the Sun use the thermal energy provided by the \ndecay of radioactive material; this is the case of Ulysses   , depicted in Section   10.3.2    . \nShort-lived probes or sub-satellites can use a battery as a single source of power. \n\n Eclipses produce variations in solar illumination and in the corresponding produc-\ntion of power. The switching on or off of the satellite\u2019s various components produces \nvarying power demands. To smooth out energy production and demand, the power \nsubsystem stores and consumes electrical power from rechargeable batteries   . There \nare several types of batteries available: NiCd, Hydrogen, and Lithium. Currently, Li \nbatteries are the most widely used. Dedicated electronic units control the delivery of \nenergy to the satellite, as well as the charging and discharging of the batteries. \nPayloads requiring high-pulsed power demand, such as a SAR   , require particular care \nin the design on the power subsystem    and harness, providing adequate capacitance to \navoid sending current ripples to other electrical equipment. \n\n The power subsystem    also includes the harness needed to provide electrical power \nto all the components of the satellite. \n\n The fundamental design requisite is the power demand pro fi le   , that is, which satel-\nlite components are operating and when. The power demand pro fi le is matched by the \npower production pro fi le   , which depends on the solar array    size and orientation, \nthe frequency and the duration of eclipses   , and the size of the batteries   . Solar array \nsize limitations have been discussed in Sections   10.1.4     and   10.6.3    . \n\n Power voltage and voltage ranges must also be selected. Normally, small- and \nmedium-size satellites use 28 V, while large satellites use higher voltages. Higher \nvoltages reduce losses in transmission but require the implementation of voltage \nreduction devices, DC-DC converters, for most electronic components. \n\n As far as power distribution is concerned, a choice between regulated and unregu-\nlated buses    must be made. Medium-size satellites normally work at 28 V if regulated, \nand in the range of 23\u201332 V if unregulated. Regulated buses simplify the design of \nsatellite components and complicate the design of power subsystem   . The situation is \nthe reverse in unregulated buses. Earth-observ   ing satellites normally use unregulated \nbuses; science missions normally use regulated buses   . \n\n There are two main approaches for controlling solar arrays   : peak power tracking    \nand direct energy transfer   . Peak power tracking gives a reduction in the size of the \nsolar array   . Direct energy transfer reduces the complexity of the power distribution \nelectronics   . \n\n Solar array size depends on the solar illumination conditions, cell characteristics, \nmission life,    and temperature; cooler batteries    are more ef fi cient. \n\n Battery type, capability, and maximum allowable depth of discharge will be deter-\nmined by the availability of quali fi ed or about-to-be quali fi ed equipment, the mission \nlife    and the corresponding number of charge/discharge cycles.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n376 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    11.1.2.   Satellite data handling \n\n The heart of the satellite data handling subs   ystem is a general-purpose digital computer, \nwhich monitors and controls the satellite. In addition to the central computer, this \nsubsystem may include other computers for performing specialized functions that \ninclude digital signal processors for the handling of the information produced by the \ninstruments   , a dedicated computer for controlling the attitude of the satellite, or a \nsimpler, higher-reliability computer that can take control of the satellite in special \nemergency situations. To simplify interfaces, specialized computers can also be used \nfor the monitoring and control of speci fi c parts of the satellite. This is the case for \nmulti-instrument missions that often have a speci fi c computer to deal with the control \nand monitoring of the instruments. The control and monitoring of the satellite requires \nthe storage of information; in the past, tape recorders were used, today solid-state digital \nmemories provide this function. \n\n To interchange information between the satellite\u2019s components, one or more data \ntransfer buses and their corresponding bus controllers are necessary, depending on the \nrequirements   . As in the case of computers, general-purpose data buses    like the 1553 \nor CAN are used. Special arrangements are provided to deal with functions beyond \nthe capabilities of general-purpose buses, including the transfer of large amounts of \ndata produced by some instruments   , or to provide highly interactive real-time data \ntransfer as needed by the satellite\u2019s attitude control   . Discrete, point-to-point inter-\nfaces will also be necessary, for example, analog signals to command or to monitor \nelectromechanical actuators. Some type of central clock will provide the mission\u2019s \ntime reference. \n\n The data handling    subsystem    also includes all the software    required to perform all \nthe necessary functions and to run in all the components mentioned above. The on-board \nsoftware    will include the software to perform the basic operations and the mission-\nspeci fi c software \n\n Space missions can last a long time and the space environment    is harsh, demand-\ning high reliability for satellite hardware. For these reasons, demonstrating that an \nelectronic digital component is adequate for this environment takes time, requiring a \ndedicated space quali fi cation program, and therefore in-orbit computers are of older \ndesign and lower performance than their corresponding and more familiar ground-\nbased equivalents. \n\n The design decisions are driven by the complexity of the command and control \nfunctions that the satellite must perform, which are driven in turn by the number and \noperational pro fi les of the instruments    and of the mission itself. The most important \ndecision is the level of mission autonomy    to be implemented as this will drive the \nnumber of operational data  fl ow    contacts between the ground and the satellite. In \nnominal conditions, the satellite must be able to operate without ground contacts    for \ndays or even weeks. At the same time, the satellite must be able to contact the ground \nas rapidly as possible in cases where an unexpected event has occurred. \n\n As far as monitoring is concerned, it is also essential to determine how often the \nsatellite\u2019s status and how many functional parameters are to be monitored and sent to \nthe ground. This decision should be taken after considering in detail the failure modes \nof all the satellite\u2019s components and how they shall be monitored in order to differenti-\nate between them. This information will be extremely valuable in case of a failure, as \n\n\n\n377The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\nit will ease the designing of a recovery strategy for the satellite, allowing a successful \ncontinuation of the mission. This set of the satellite\u2019s functional parameters that de fi ne \nits status and that are sent to the ground is called \u201chousekeeping data   .\u201d \n\n Modes have been already introduced in Section   9.5    . It is recalled here that during \nits lifetime, the satellite will be confronted with widely different operational situations \nthat require totally different approaches to how the satellite behaves. These are the \nsatellite\u2019s operational modes   . In the previous paragraph we identi fi ed two of these \nmodes: the nominal one and an emergency mode when the \u201cback-up\u201d computer can \ntake over. The satellite will also require a special mode for the period immediately \nafter the launcher    ejects it. In this mode the satellite will progressively wake up, \nmaneuvre, and change con fi gurations to reach its  fi nal nominal status. The execution \nof orbital correction maneuvers    also requires a dedicated mode. The transition between \nmodes can be performed either by ground command or automatically by the satellite. \n\n The number and function of the computers on-board is another fundamental \ndesign decision. The satellite needs a central computer to control it in nominal opera-\ntional circumstances, though supplementary specialized computers can also be used. \nA redundant computer, able to take over the main computer in case of failure, is also \nrequired. This computer must be simple and extremely reliable, and must be capable \nof controlling the limited number of functions absolutely necessary for the satellite\u2019s \nsurvival. Sometimes ground assembly and veri fi cation needs determine the number \nof on-board computers    needed. A satellite that is often divided into two halves, one \nfor the instruments    and one for the satellite subsystems, would be easier to assemble \nand test if each half possesses its own intelligence. It must be decided what computer \nmodels and solid-state memory are going to be used. This selection is strongly \nin fl uenced by the relative scarcity of adequate hardware. Due to the harsh radiation \nenvironment    of space, achieving con fi dence in the adequacy of digital hardware for \nspace use is not an easy task. In the USA, the power PC-based, radiation resistant \nATIM RAD-6000 1  has been used on many missions; in Europe, the SPARC-based \nLEON 2  performs an equivalent role. To ensure added design robustness, the software    \nin the redundant computer should be independent of the software in the main com-\nputer, avoiding the use of the same algorithms, and ideally supplied by an indepen-\ndent contractor. This is often dif fi cult to realize in practice. \n\n The number and selection of the data buses    to be used is also crucial. In some cases \na single bus, for example, 1553 or CAN bus, will be suf fi cient for all the satellite\u2019s needs. \nIn other cases different busses will be needed for different purposes, for example, one \nbus for general control, one for high data throughput instrument output, data control, \nand another one for highly interactive attitude control    hardware data interchange. \n\n It must also be decided how to consider software   : as either a separate subsystem    \nunder a central authority or divided into as many parts as the components that need \nsoftware. A centralized approach will reduce the problems of interfacing between the \ndifferent software modules but it will create interface problems between each soft-\nware module and the hardware component it interacts with. This interface is espe-\ncially complex because a component, which includes hardware and the software to \noperate it, needs to be approved as functional, and is paid for only after it has \n\n    1    32 Bit Radiation Hardened Computers for Space, J.

This certi fi cation process and the allocation \nof responsibilities in the case of malfunction are especially complicated when different \nsuppliers produce the hardware and the software. \n\n The fundamental components of this subsystem    (computers, clocks, memory, and \nbuses) are selected from a normally small range of already-quali fi ed or about-to-be \nquali fi ed options that the specialist designer provides to the architect   . Many factors \nin fl uence the selection of the basic data handling    architecture: from operational needs \nto veri fi cation needs; and from computer availability    to the supplier   \u2019s previous expe-\nrience. Nevertheless, the number of basic possible architectures is limited, and there \nis a strong basic similarity between the data handling architecture for missions with \nwidely different operational needs. The avionics architecture of the complex and \nexpensive Sentinel-3    (Figure  11.9 ) and of the simple and cheaper SSTL-DMS \n(Figure  11.11 ) are strikingly similar.  \n\n    11.1.3.   Telemetry and telecommand data communications \n\n The telemetry and telecommand data communications subsystem    allows the inter-\nchange of information between the satellite and ground. \n\n Antennas are necessary for the emission and reception of signals. The charac-\nteristics of these antennas will depend on their beam widths and frequencies. \nAntennas for telemetry    and telecommand    should be omnidirectional so they can \nprovide satellite-to-ground contact when the satellite is in a nonnominal attitude    in \ncase of attitude failure, or if the satellite is agile during normal operations. \nOmnidirectional antennas are small, provide low gains, and are only adequate for \nreceiving and transmitting at modest data rates. To cope with higher data rates, the \nsatellite will also require antennas with larger dimensions and higher gains. Very \nhigh-gain antennas are appropriate for high data rate communication and for deep \nspace    missions. The signal shall be ampli fi ed and modulated at the frequency \nrequired. This will be performed by specialized components dedicated to these two \nfunctions. The characteristics of these units will also depend on the data rate and \nthe frequency bands   . \n\n The uplink    and downlink    signals will be digitally processed: encoded or decoded \nand encrypted or decrypted. Dedicated digital processing modules perform these \nfunctions. With regard to the downlinking    of information, these modules receive the \ndigital information, produced by all of the satellite\u2019s components, merge them into a \nsingle data stream, and format them according to speci fi c standards. As far as the \nuplink of commands is concerned, these modules receive the commands reaching the \nsatellite and transform them into a list of commands that are validated as legitimate \nand then send them to the on-board data handling subsystem    for execution. In every \ncase the digital processing of the uplink and downlink data streams has three aims:\n\n   To protect the data stream against possible errors in the transmission of information. \u2022 \nThis is the  fi eld of the error detection and correction codes.  \n  To allow the merging and separation of information by providing labels that indicate \u2022 \nwhat information is related to what satellite function. This is the  fi eld of the packing \ntelemetry    codes.  \n  To encrypt the information so that only legitimate users can use it. This is the role \u2022 \nof the encryption codes.    \n\n\n\n379The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\n Each one of these functions is performed by its dedicated hardware. \n The design decisions are driven by the necessary frequency of contacts between \n\nthe ground and space, which is derived from the level of autonomy    chosen by the \nmission. \n\n The design decisions for this subsystem    are strongly constrained by regulations. \nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU   ) regulates the frequency for all RF \nspectrum users. Therefore also the radio frequency uplink    and downlink    of informa-\ntion from ground to space will have to be implemented following the ITU Radio \nRegulations. These regulations allocate parts of the RF spectrum to satellite users. \nA subset of the space science    bands is allocated to deep space    science, de fi ned as \nsatellite operating at more than 2 million kilometers. To avoid interference, ITU also \nregulates the maximum power density allowed to arrive on Earth    inside the allocated \nbands and, with much tighter requirements   , outside them (unwanted emissions). The \n fi nal result is that the range of possible design is limited by these regulations. \n\n The power of the ampli fi ers needed for in-orbit data reception and emission will \nbe directly derived from the selected communication speed, the chosen ground sta-\ntions,    and the chosen satellite antenna\u2019s gain   . The power needed must be high enough \nto provide adequate margins to the communication link, but low enough to ful fi ll ITU    \nregulations. \n\n As an example the bands allocated with primary status to science and earth obser-\nvation services are provided in the next table (Table  11.1 ).  \n\n There are also speci fi c bands dedicated to meteorological or communications \nsatellites. \n\n   Table 11.1.

Higher frequencies allow higher \ndata rates but the availability of on-board and ground hardware is more limited, while \nhigher frequencies suffer stronger attenuation by water vapor and rain. For the same \ngain, higher frequencies also reduce the size of the antennae. This can be an advantage \nfor satellite accommodation. \n\n The distance from the satellite to ground and the quantity of information produced \nby the instrument and monitoring of the satellite drive the decision to use one or two \nlinks. Earth observation    satellites produce very high amounts of data and normally use \ntwo downlinks: one omnidirectional, moderate speed data link for satellite monitoring \nand command, and a second one, optimized for speed, for the instrument output. In the \ncase of space science    missions the ratio between the data produced by the satellite and \nthat produced by the instrument is smaller; and in addition, contact with these satellites \noften takes place at great distances from the Earth. This promotes a single, very power-\nful data link that blends all the data produced by the satellite. Nevertheless, space \nscience satellites are also moving toward separating these two functions, because of:\n\n   The need for increasingly sophisticated instruments    with expanding data produc-\u2022 \ntion rates is pushing in this direction. One example will be JWST   , as described in \nSection   7.2.1    .  \n  Lower data throughput   , higher pointing  fl exibility data links for critical events \u2022 \nsuch as planet swing-bys, allows better command and monitoring. The multiple \ndata links of Rosetta   , described below in Section  11.4.2 , are examples.    \n\n On the other hand this double approach requires the implementation in the satellite \nof two different communication channels. To avoid this it is also possible to imple-\nment one single frequency but working at two speeds: a lower speed for critical \noperations and a higher speed for normal operations, which includes also instrument \ndata downlink   . \n\n The accommodation of the antenna is determined by its frequency and gain. \nAntennas for satellite operations    should have a wide area of coverage; ideally there \nshould be two antennas, each one with half-hemispherical coverage. Wide- fi eld-of-\nview low-gain antennas    are small and easy to accommodate. High-gain antennas   , on \nthe other hand, are large and might be dominant elements in the con fi guration    of the \nsatellite. The Rosetta    con fi guration (Figure  11.6 ) and the Ulysses    con fi guration \n(Figure   10.17    ) are good illustrations of this.   \n\n    3      http://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx      \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://public.ccsds.org/default.aspx\n\n\n381The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\n    11.2.   On-ground components involved in the domain \n\n The aim of this book is to study the early design stages of space systems. To be able to \nprovide a credible estimation of the overall mission cost   , schedule,    and risk   , the satellite \nmust be designed with a fairly high degree of detail. Nevertheless, satellite operations    \nand ground segment    physical facilities, like large ground antennas or mission control    \nfacilities, are almost never designed speci fi cally for one particular mission. Ground \ncontrol facilities are almost always already existing infrastructures requiring only adap-\ntations for the particular needs of the mission under consideration. Moreover, these \nfacilities are easier to implement than the space elements. Satellite operations    are also a \ndomain where standardized mission preparation and control methodologies are appli-\ncable. This would imply the use of multimission infrastructures, including common \npersonnel, who can transfer know-how from one project to the next. For all these rea-\nsons, during the design phases prior to program approval, it is necessary to perform a \nthorough functional design    of the ground segment, but it is not necessary to perform \na physical design   . Therefore, this section will be limited to a discussion of functional \ndesign decisions, while the physical implementation will remain uncovered. At any \nrate, the earlier the functional design of the ground segment is established, the better. \nA spacecraft designed without due regard to the ground elements is a de fi cient design. \nA correct early understanding of the end-to-end data  fl ow and a correct apportioning \nof functions between space and ground is compulsory for a proper mission design. \n\n    11.2.1.   Operational ground stations and data-relay satellites \n\n These components relay the information to and from the satellite to the mission control    \ncenters. The data received from the satellite must be demodulated before being sent to \nthe mission control center   , and the commands received from the mission control center \nhave to be modulated before sending them to the satellite. Considering the need for \nspeed and for expert analysis of the information about the satellite\u2019s status, which is \nundertaken at the mission control center, the components under discussion act as fast \nconduits for the information, while experiencing only minimum delay or processing. \n\n The fundamental design decision concerns the location and number of operational \nground stations    and the resulting time elapsed without contacts between ground and \nspace. This decision will be driven by the operational approach and the responsiveness    \nrequirements    regarding the mission\u2019s allowable reaction times. \n\n Data-relay satellites allow much longer and more frequent contacts, almost \ncontinuous in cases where a suf fi cient number of data-relay satellites    are available. \nThis is a very powerful feature, which greatly enhances the mission\u2019s capabilities. \nOn the other hand, a data-relay satellite or a constellation of data-relay satellites is an \nextremely expensive infrastructure. NASA is unique in possessing an operational \ndata-relay satellite    constellation. ESA operates just a single data-relay satellite: the \ngeostationary    Artemis.    4  \n\n Another important design decision concerns the degree of centralization of the \nmission\u2019s operations function. Mission operations    are highly centralized. The mission \noperational ground stations    are capable of sending commands that could endanger the \n\n    4      http://www.esa.int/artemislaunch/      \n\nhttp://www.esa.int/artemislaunch/\n\n\n382 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nsatellite. This is a heavy responsibility, so there is almost always a single mission \ncontrol    center. \n\n The availability of data-relay satellites    is extremely limited. Their availability, \nor more likely, nonavailability, will be a system constraint    imposed on the designer. \nThe selection of the number and locations of the operational ground stations    will also \nbe very limited as a result of the high level of responsibility involved in commanding \nthe satellite. These stations shall be selected from the small set of stations directly \nowned by the mission\u2019s operating entity. In practice this means that there are few \ndesign decisions to be made in this area, because most of the components to be used \nalready exist, and their employment will be another design constraint.  \n\n    11.2.2.   Mission operations    control centers \n\n The functions performed by the mission operations    and control center are many and \ncomplex. They can be divided into three main groups: (1) mission monitoring and \ncontrol; (2) determination of the orbit and attitude of the satellite; and (3) maintenance \nof the know-how needed for the correct operation of the mission. Mission monitoring \nand control includes all the activities necessary for the operation of the mission:\n\n   Reception, processing and analysis of the operational information sent by the \u2022 \nsatellite, allowing its monitoring.  \n  Generation of commands as required by the satellite, both in nominal and in non-\u2022 \nnominal situations.  \n  Mission planning is the generation of all the commands that shall be sent to the satel-\u2022 \nlite. This is a complex function that requires close coordination with the instrument\u2019s \ndata processing center    in order to acquire data as requested by the consumers   .  \n  Maintenance and updating of the on-board software    as required by the mission\u2019s \u2022 \nevolution. All missions, even fully successful ones, require frequent software    \nmodi fi cations to optimize the satellite\u2019s current behavior in orbit. This requires \nboth the creation and uplinking    of the software modi fi cations, and continuous \nmonitoring of the current status of on-board software.  \n  The monitoring and control of ground-based communication networks and of \u2022 \nthe operational ground stations    themselves, including commands to the ground \nstations    for receiving information from the satellite or for uplinking    commands to \nit at the right moment and in the required direction.    \n\n Mission operations    require the ability to reconstruct and predict the satellite\u2019s \norbital position and attitude. Methods for orbit determination    and control have been \ndiscussed in Section   9.1.2    . Traditionally, the ground stations    have performed \u201cranging   \u201d \nthat measures the changes of the frequency signal received from the satellite. These \nchanges are a function of the velocity of the satellite with respect to the ground station \nand to measure them allow deriving the velocity. To date, these functions have been \nperformed on the ground, but are now being progressively located on-board. Satellites \nlocated in low Earth orbit    can use GPS    receivers to autonomously determine the orbit. \nSpecialized ground-based  fl ight dynamics calculation, however, will always be \nnecessary for checking the autonomous on-board performance, and for determining \nand commanding exceptional, high-risk    maneuvers, such as major orbital changes   . \n\n In order to carry out mission control functions, understand the satellite\u2019s behavior, \nand avoid the uplink    of commands or software    modi fi cations that might be detrimental \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n383The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\nto the satellite, the mission control center    must maintain databases containing crucial \ninformation related to the satellite:\n\n   Satellite documentation and simulated computer models of the behavior of instru-\u2022 \nments    and platforms. This will facilitate scrutiny of the satellite\u2019s health status and \nthe simulation of any anomalous behavior.  \n  Information and computer models related to the ground segment    itself.  \u2022 \n  Records of all operational data  fl ow    between the satellite and ground segment   , \u2022 \nincluding the status of the on-board software    and all its modi fi cations.  \n  Records of the on-board monitored parameters to identify their status and deter-\u2022 \nmine any potential long-term evolution of the satellite\u2019s hardware.  \n  Access to satellite hardware experts in case of problems.    \u2022 \n\n Proper processing of the data produced by the instruments    will require knowledge \nof the values of numerous satellite parameters, such as the temperature of detectors \nor the attitude of the satellite. These parameters shall be provided to the instrument \ndata processing    ground segment    to allow for the correct processing and calibration    of \nthe mission\u2019s data products. The mission control    center will include components for \nperforming this function. \n\n The fundamental design decisions regarding the mission control    center are directly \nrelated to the fundamental functional allocations of the overall operational data  fl ow   :\n\n   The need for supplementary ground stations    for special circumstances: for example, \u2022 \nat the beginning of the mission, in case of failures or during especially risky \noperations.  \n  The most appropriate mode of data acquisition for the events under observation.  \u2022 \n  Satellite autonomy    versus ground intervention   . This decision will allow the deter-\u2022 \nmination of the level of service to be provided by the mission control    center: \ncontinuous; exclusively working hours; or only in case of unexpected events.  \n  Centralized versus decentralized. As explained above, mission control    is almost \u2022 \nalways highly centralized and the use of existing facilities, adapted according to \nneed, is almost always mandatory.    \n\n The mission control    center requires a heavy investment that nearly always exists \nprior to the start of the mission design process   , and the system designer must be able \nto count on the ground segment    and operations specialists in order to understand the \nfeatures of the existing mission control center   . Mission control centers are more fre-\nquently acting as permanent multimission infrastructures that evolve and adjust \nthemselves to new missions while maintaining a central core. The use of standard \nprocedures, i.e., ESA SCOS-2000, 5  facilitates this progressive adaptation.   \n\n    11.3.   Mission phases \n\n Satellite attitude and orbit control modes, as well as overall satellite modes   , were \npresented in Section   9.5     as part of the discussion about the orbit and attitude design \ndomains. The present chapter, which deals with the satellite\u2019s operations throughout \n\n    5    Lessons Learned from the Integration of Hi fl y and SCOS-2000 in NASA GMSC, T.

Each one \nof these periods constitutes a distinct mission phase. \n\n    11.3.1.   Launch and early operations \n\n During the launch and early operations phase    the satellite is ejected by the launcher   , \nacquired by the ground segment,    and recon fi gured until it adopts  fi rst a safe con fi guration    \nand  fi nally its nominal in-orbit con fi guration   . The launcher releases the satellite, which \nprogressively switches itself on. It must recon fi gure itself by acquiring the correct atti-\ntude, deploying its solar arrays    and other deployables, and must contact Earth    to con fi rm \nthat it is ready and waiting. This is a critical period because the satellite release is always \naccompanied by some residual tumbling, and before producing electrical energy the \ntumbling must be stopped, the correct attitude acquired and the solar array    deployed. All \nthese functions have to be performed as quickly as possible using electrical energy from \nthe satellite\u2019s batteries   . During this early phase intensive interaction between the satel-\nlite and ground is necessary. This is why a large number of ground stations    are rented \nfor this brief critical period, which lasts several days. Some satellites perform the most \ncritical actions \u2013 for instance, the deployment of the solar array \u2013 under ground control. \nIn other cases the satellite performs the critical actions autonomously. Autonomous \noperation is risky but minimizes the time expended by the satellite in an unsafe \ncon fi guration. In some cases there is a need for dedicated prelaunch activities of lim-\nited duration when there may be speci fi c payload or platform-driven constraints, for \nexample, transfer from external electrical power to satellite battery power, which will \nrestrict the satellite battery life if the satellite is powered during launch.  \n\n    11.3.2.   Commissioning    of the satellite \n\n This commissioning phase    begins when the satellite reaches its nominal initial orbit \nwith its nominal con fi guration   . During this phase each satellite component is studied \nand characterized to determine its actual performance. The various instruments    are \nswitched on and characterized. The on-board software    is updated with parameters to \nmake optimal use of the current performances of the satellite and its instruments. \nOptimal performance during this phase requires the involvement of a large number of \nexperts on both the satellite\u2019s subsystems and its instruments in order to analyze their \nactual in-orbit performance. Depending on the satellite\u2019s complexity and its actual \nperformance in orbit, this phase can last from a few weeks to a few months.  \n\n    11.3.3.   Nominal operation \n\n The nominal operations phase    is the main phase of the satellite\u2019s life. The satellite is \nfully functional and ful fi lling its expected aims. The duration of this mission phase \nwill be as long as possible, but at least as long as speci fi ed.  \n\n\n\n385The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\n    11.3.4.   Safe mode and other dormant modes \n\n The satellite needs a special attitude and satellite mode in case of a major malfunction. \nTo cope with this, the satellite switches off the instruments    and as many electrical \ncomponents as possible. The satellite can also disconnect part of its intelligence. \nThe satellite remains in a special easy-to-maintain attitude, which ensures a safe situ-\nation that permits any identi fi ed problem to be analyzed and solved without time \nconstraints. A dormant mode    can also be used to keep the satellite safe during the \nlong travel periods needed for planetary exploration. Once the satellite\u2019s problem has \nbeen resolved, or once it reaches its planetary target, the satellite can be returned to \nits nominal mode   . The safe mode    requires minimum contact with the ground and can \nbe of long duration, and theoretically of unlimited duration.  \n\n    11.3.5.   Nominal orbit correction maneuvers \n\n This mode could potentially perform orbital changes   . It might require the adoption of \na special attitude and the switching off of the instruments   . Once the orbital maneuver \nis performed, the satellite would return to the nominal mode   . This mode should be as \nshort as possible.  \n\n    11.3.6.   Decommissioning and disposal \n\n At the end of the satellite\u2019s operational life   , and in order to avoid adding to the \ncontinual increase of dangerous orbital debris   , the satellite\u2019s orbital parameters could \nbe changed to an orbit low enough that atmospheric drag    will eliminate it within a \nreasonable period of time. Where this is not possible, i.e., in geostationary satellites, \nthe satellite is moved to a \u201cgraveyard orbit   \u201d where it will not be a danger to other \nsatellites. Any excess fuel is vented to avoid risk    of subsequent explosion. Introducing \nprovisos for allowing disposal is expensive because it demands the performance of a \ncomplex maneuver at the end of the satellite\u2019s life, when its reliability is at its lowest. \nNevertheless, decommissioning is becoming compulsory in order to reduce the growing \ndanger of in-orbit collision with orbital debris. This phase is brief but complicated, \nbecause the satellite could be partially nonfunctional at the end of its operational life.   \n\n    11.4.   Examples of data handling architectures \n\n    11.4.1.   Cluster    \n\n    11.4.1.1.   Mission aim \n Cluster    6  is a mission whose aim is to study small-scale structures in the magneto-\nsphere    of the Earth   . To achieve this, Cluster is made up of four identical spacecrafts \nthat  fl y in a tetrahedral con fi guration   . This allows an analysis of the magnetosphere\u2019s \nsmall-scale structures because the simultaneous measurements provided by the four \nsatellites permits a separation among the magnetosphere\u2019s variations in both space \n\n    6    ESA Achievements, BR-250, ESA 2005.  \n\n\n\n386 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nand time. The original mission life    was 5 years. Cluster was launched in July 2000 \nand it remained in operation in 2009. The four satellites  fl y as a constellation along a \nhighly elliptical orbit   , with 19,000 km of perigee    and 119,000 km of apogee   ; the \norbital period    is 57 h and the orbit inclination    is 90\u00b0. The separation among the satel-\nlites varies between 40 km and 20,000 km, depending on orbital conditions. Cluster\u2019s \norbit is essentially  fi xed in inertial space   , so that in the course of a year the apogee \nmoves from the tail region into the solar-wind region of the magnetosphere, thereby \nallowing all areas of the magnetosphere to be addressed (Figure  11.2 ).  \n\n The mission is now funded to continue operating until 2012.  \n\n    11.4.1.2.   Con fi guration \n Each one of the four satellites is 1,200 kg, stabilized by spinning at 15 rpm and carry \n12 \u201cin situ   \u201d instruments    for the detection of charged particles and magnetic and elec-\ntrical  fi elds. The total mass of each Cluster    payload is 72 kg. The most sensitive \ninstruments are located on long deployable booms    to avoid electromagnetic noise \nproduced by the satellite electronics.    7  In line with the spin   -stabilized concept, the \ncon fi guration    is cylindrical, with the solar array    located on the sides of the cylinder. \nThe spacecraft\u2019s cylindrical design is shaped by the body-mounted solar array and \nalso optimizes the  fi elds of view available to the experiments, which are arranged \naround the rim of the main equipment platform on the upper side of the spacecraft. \nThe height of the spacecraft\u2019s body has been minimized to make optimal use of the \nfairing volume offered by the launch vehicle (Figure     11.3 ).   \n\n    11.4.1.3.

Cluster   \u2019s Mission Operations    Centre is located in the \nEuropean Space Operations Center (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, with a single 15 \nm diameter S-band ground antenna station in Villafranca, near Madrid, Spain, and a \nJoint Science Operations Centre (JSOC) at RAL Didcot, UK, which establishes the \nobservational strategy and provides it to the Mission Operations Centre in Darmstadt. \nNevertheless, the 35 m diameter ground antenna located in New Norcia (Western \nAustralia) is also used for critical passes. \n\n The mission\u2019s initial phase, in which the four spacecraft are maneuvred to reach \ntheir  fi nal, highly inclined and highly elliptical orbits, lasted about 3 weeks. The  fi nal \nspacecraft con fi guration    was then attained with the deployment of two rigid booms \ncarrying the experiment sensors and four 50 m wire booms    for electrical  fi eld mea-\nsurements. The commissioning phase    needed 10 weeks to properly characterize the \nsatellites and their payload. The nominal science operations phase began at the end \nof the commissioning phase and has progressed until the present. \n\n The observational strategy during the nominal phase was driven by the need for \nseasonal changes of observational strategy. The orbit is  fi xed in inertial space    and the \nEarth\u2019s    magnetosphere   , which is determined by the Sun   \u2019s orientation, which rotates \nonce per year around the mission orbital plane   . This implies that throughout the year, \nthe orbit will move through different parts of the magnetosphere, hence requiring \ndifferent observation strategies. This requires seasonal adjustments of the instru-\nments   \u2019 observing strategies and the volume of data production. As part of these \nseasonal adjustments of the observation strategy and in order to better study the \n\n  Figure 11.3.

Cluster   \u2019s satellites \nproduce data at different rates, depending on their situation. When in contact with the \nground station, the telemetry    stream downlinks data in real time at 22 kbit/s, but also \npossesses a faster \u201cburst mode\u201d of 131 kbit/s for playback of previously recorded \ndata. The Wide Band Data experiment, which operates during brief periods of each \norbit, produces information in real time, and downlinks it at 220 kbit/s. On average, \neach satellite produces 0.8 Gbit per day. \n\n The mission planning    activities take place at different levels, each one having a \ndifferent time horizon. The  fi rst level is long-term planning, which is based on a plan-\nning period of 6 months. The second level is the short-term operational planning, \nbased on a weekly cycle. Both planning phases are created by interaction between the \nJoint Science Operations Centre at RAL and the mission operations    center at ESOC. \nThis interaction ensures that the science observation plan    is compatible with the satel-\nlites\u2019 resources and positions. \n\n It is worth mentioning that after 9 years of orbital life the spacecraft batteries    are \nseverely degraded, to the extent that during some eclipses    some of the spacecraft are \npowered down and reactivated after the end of the eclipse   . This is possible with Cluster    \nsince the spacecraft are spin-stabilized and their attitude is therefore inherently stable.  \n\n    11.4.1.4.   On-board subsystems \n The power subsystem    is made up of a  fi xed silicon-cell solar array    covering the exter-\nnal cylindrical shape of the satellite, while  fi ve silver-cadmium batteries    totaling 80 \nAh provide power during eclipses   , plus the necessary power control    and distribution \nelectronics   . \n\n The satellite on-board data handling    OBDH subsystem    is shown in Figure  11.4  \nand includes: \n\n   A Central Data Management Unit (CDMU) with a central computer (CTU), a time \u2022 \nreference Ultra Stable Oscillator (USO), and the command-decoding unit. The \nCDMU acts as the satellite\u2019s nerve center and directly controls the solid-state \nrecorders (SSR), the data bus (OBDH bus), and the communications subsystem   .  \n  A Remote Terminal Unit (RTU), which controls all experiments, the power subsys-\u2022 \ntem   , the thermal control    and the satellite\u2019s attitude and orbit control    subsystems.  \n  A solid-state recorder (SSR), that stores the data produced when the satellite is out \u2022 \nof direct visibility with the single ground station. It is controlled by the CTU and \nit can store up to 5 Gbit of data.    \n\n The OBDH decodes and distributes commands, received by the telecommunica-\ntion subsystem, which have been uplinked at a rate of 2 kbit/s, and acquires and \nencodes telemetry    from payload and subsystem units. This telemetry is delivered \neither to the telecommunications subsystem for real-time transmission to the ground, \nor to the solid-state recorder (SSR) for later transmission. In order to reduce the duration \nof the downlink    during the limited ground station visibility periods, dedicated high \n\n\n\n389The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\ndata rate interfaces are provided to the Wide Band Data (WBD) experiment. A dedi-\ncated digital wave processor (DWP) supports the real-time WBD experiment and \nother related instruments   . \n\n The S-band    communications subsystem    includes three low-gain antennas   , a redun-\ndant set of transponders, a 10 W radio frequency ampli fi er, a distribution unit, and associ-\nated harnesses. Two hemispherical coverage, low-gain antennas are mounted on \ndeployable booms    attached to the upper and lower faces of the spacecraft. They ensure \nfull coverage for uplinking    and downlinking   . A third antenna mounted on the lower side \nof the spacecraft is used until the in-orbit deployment of the lower antenna boom.   \n\n    11.4.2.   Rosetta    \n    11.4.2.1.   Mission aim \n Rosetta    8  is a deep space science    mission whose aim is to study the origin of comets, \nthe relationships between comets and interstellar material and their implications with \nregard to the origin of the solar system   . Rosetta consists of an orbiter and a small \nsub-satellite lander called Philae   . If all goes as planned, Rosetta will rendezvous    9  with \ncomet 67P Churyumov Gerasimenko in 2014. Rosetta will orbit and observe the \ncomet, while the Philae lander is released from Rosetta to land on the comet\u2019s surface. \nIn order to rendezvous with the targeted comet, Rosetta must  fl y a complex orbit, \nincluding one Mars    and three Earth    swing-by    maneuvres to increase the satellite\u2019s \nspeed. On its way to the target comet, Rosetta will also visit the asteroids Lutetia    and \nSteins   .

Con fi guration \n The satellite is an inertially stabilized    cubic box with the Philae    lander attached to one \nof its sides. The satellite con fi guration    is dominated by the large high-gain parabolic \ncommunication antenna for contacting Earth   , and by the very large solar arrays    \nneeded to receive energy from the distant Sun   . The satellite\u2019s mass is 3,000 kg, \nincluding 1,600 kg of fuel. Philae weighs 100 kg. There are pointing mechanisms    for \nsteering the solar array    toward the Sun and the parabolic antenna    toward Earth \n(Figure  11.5 ).  \n\n The payload of Rosetta    includes four remote sensing    instruments   : one providing \npanoramic and detailed color images, and three spectrometers   . There are also three \ninstruments for in situ    chemical composition analysis and four others for studying the \ndust and electromagnetic environment around the satellite. The Lander carries ten \nexperiments, which will provide images and in situ data on the comet (Figure  11.6 ).   \n\n    11.4.2.3.   Operational concept and mission phases \n Rosetta   \u2019s mission operations    center is in Darmstadt, Germany, with a primary ground \nstation located in New Norcia, Australia, which features a large 35 m diameter \nantenna. For emergencies, the mission can make use of the American Deep Space \nNetwork\u2019s antennas, up to 70 m in diameter. Perth provides up to 12 h of coverage \nper day, though only around 9 h will normally be used. New Norcia is one of the three \n\n  Figure 11.5.

The second one is in Cebreros Spain and the \nthird one \u2013 under construction in 2009 \u2013 is in Malargue, Argentina. There is also a \nLander Control Centre and a Science Operations Centre for use by investigators. \nGiven Rosetta\u2019s complex orbit, its operations are also complex:\n\n   In order to reach its intermediate and  fi nal targets, the satellite\u2019s projected life is \u2022 \nvery long.  \n  The long distance to the  fi nal target obliges long periods of satellite hibernation in \u2022 \ndormant mode   .  \n  Hibernation will be interrupted by special high-activity events including orbital \u2022 \nmaneuvres, planetary swing-bys, and encounters with the two asteroids to be \napproached and studied during the satellite\u2019s journey.  \n  The mission\u2019s latter stages, including the release of the Philae    lander and the orbiting \u2022 \nof Rosetta    around the comet requires high levels of activity.    \n\n The widely varying distances from the satellite to the Sun    and the Earth    further \ncomplicates the mission:\n\n   The varying distance to the Sun    changes the satellite\u2019s thermal and power environ-\u2022 \nment. This compels changes in energy management strategies to cope with the \nvarying electrical energy production and heat dissipation    pro fi les.  \n  The varying distance from the satellite to the Earth    requires the use of different \u2022 \ntypes of communication links employing low, medium, and high-gain antennas, \neach of them specialized for speci fi c distances and purposes.  \n  The long distance between the Earth    and the satellite \u2013 up to 6 AU \u2013 entails long \u2022 \nwaiting times between the satellite monitoring, satellite commanding, and com-\nmands execution instants. Data needs up to 50 min to travel from the satellite to \nground (Figure  11.7 ).     \n\n  Figure 11.7.     Varying Rosetta    Satellites Distances to the Sun    and to the Earth     ( Mission \nOperations    for the New Rosetta   , Paolo Ferri, International Astronautical \nCongress, IAC-03-Q.5.01, Bremen 2003).       \n\n \n\n\n\n392 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n Rosetta   \u2019s operations manage to be simultaneously interactive and autonomous. \nInteractive because ground intervention    is needed to cope with the complex scenario \nof the satellite\u2019s life, and autonomous because the long waiting period between com-\nmand sending and execution, coupled with the long hibernation periods, means that \nthe satellite must have its own signi fi cant decision capabilities. The launch in March, \n2004, and the  fi rst period of operations went as planned. The spacecraft, its payload, \nand the ground segment    were successfully commissioned during an intense commis-\nsioning phase   , split into two parts during the  fl ight\u2019s  fi rst 6 months. The routine cruise \nphase started in mid-October, 2004. The satellite had already performed Mars    and \nEarth    swing-by    maneuvers and observations. In between, the satellite was in hiberna-\ntion. When in hibernation, the spacecraft spins once per minute while facing the Sun   , \nso that its solar panels    can receive as much sunlight as possible. Almost all of the \nelectrical systems are switched off, with the exception of the radio receivers, com-\nmand decoders, and power supply. Hibernation is required due to the large distance \nfrom the Sun reached by the spacecraft in its heliocentric orbit    (up to 5.3 AU). \nAlthough the spacecraft has large solar panels (64 m 2  \u2013 32 m tip to tip), the generated \npower at those distances does not allow to keep the spacecraft active. So it will be \nspun up in early 2011, and then most systems deactivated. A timer will switch them \non back in January 2014, when the distance to the Sun will be below 4.6 AU. During \nthe rest of the cruise the spacecraft is not hibernated, but kept in a low-activity mode \nand contacted once per week \n\n When Rosetta    reaches its  fi nal target, it will carefully orbit the weak-gravity    comet \nat a distance of a few kilometers, keeping its instruments    pointed toward it, for a \nperiod of 22 months. The 100 kg Philae    lander will be ejected from Rosetta and navi-\ngate to a soft landing on the comet\u2019s surface, and will relay to Earth    the information \nit gathers for as long as it manages to remain operative. Philae will be released from \na distance of 1 km from its target and the descent will take 30 min. Philae will be \ntotally autonomous, and plans are for the lander to remain alive on the comet for at \nleast one week.  \n\n    11.4.2.4.   On board subsystems \n Rosetta    10  possesses a power subsystem   , a telecommunication subsystem, the attitude \nand orbit control    subsystem, and the data management subsystem. A harness subsys-\ntem connects the individual units to the power and data handling units. The solar \narray    area is 70 m 2  and measures 34 m tip to tip. Special low intensity, low tempera-\nture solar cells    supplemented by Li-Ion batteries    provide the spacecraft with electrical \npower. \n\n The power is conditioned and distributed by the power subsystem    via a regulated \n28 V voltage bus. Any two of the four MA31750 processors are able to act as the \nsatellite\u2019s brain, providing for all its functions, including attitude control   , avionics \ncontrol, and satellite and instruments    data management. Data is stored in a 25 Gbit \nsolid-state mass memory. A navigation camera provides optical target detection and \ncan be used in a special mode to control one axis of the spacecraft during the  fl y-by \nof an asteroid. In proximity of a small body, like the asteroid Steins    in 2008, images \n\n    10    The Rosetta    Misssion, D. Kolbe, R.

The distance from Earth    to the \nsatellite can reach up to 930 million km. To cope with this scenario, there is a high-\ngain X-band    link with a large 2.2 m diameter parabolic antenna    with 28 W of trans-\nmission power. This link is able to provide from 64 kbit/s to 5 kbit/s depending on \nthe distance. During the critical rendezvous    with the comet the distance will be about \n5 AU (Figure  11.8 ) and the data will be 5 kbit/s. Uplink telecommand    rates vary from \n0.008 to 2 kbit/s, also depending on the varying distance. The Philae    lander has a 700 \nWh nonrechargeable battery that can provide up to 60 h of operation. It has also a 68 \nWh rechargeable battery fed by Si solar cells    providing a maximum power of 10 W. \nPhilae sends information to Rosetta    at 16 kbit/s. In addition of the parabolic high-gain \nantenna there are two other sets of antennae: \n\n   Two medium-gain antennas; 9\u00b0 beam-width in X-band    and 30\u00b0 beam-width in \u2022 \nS-band   , for operations at intermediate distances  \n  One pair of omnidirectional S-band    antennas for operations near Earth         \u2022 \n\n    11    Rosetta    Ground Segment and Mission Operations   , M.

Sentinel-3    \n\n Sentinel-3   \u2019s mission aim and con fi guration    have been already introduced in Section \n  8.4.3    . \n\n    11.4.3.1.   Operational concept and mission phases \n Sentinel-3   \u2019s operations are simple. Once the satellite is installed in its  fi nal orbit, fol-\nlowed by separation, recon fi guration, and attitude acquisition, the commissioning \nphase    of the mission will start. When the satellite is fully characterized and in-orbit \nvalidated, the routine operational phase of Sentinel-3 will begin. As mentioned \nabove, this routine phase will last at least 7 years, extendible to 12. After 12 years, to \nprevent it becoming dangerous orbital debris   , the satellite will be deorbited. During \nnominal operations    all the instruments    are in continuous operation, but there is no \nacquisition by the visible light channels at night, and radar altimeter    modes differ \nwhen observing different surfaces such as open ocean, coastal zones, sea ice, or \ninland waters. The satellite, which performs its own orbit determination    and carries a \ndigital model of the Earth   , autonomously changes the observation mode of the instru-\nments as required by the surface under observation. The satellite also autonomously \nprepares itself for downlinking    to the instrument ground station or for bidirectional \ncommunications with the operational ground station located in Kiruna, (Sweden). \nDuring nominal operations, the satellite can remain without contact with the opera-\ntional ground station for up to 2 weeks, but the \u201chousekeeping\u201d satellite information \nis downlinked    to instrument ground stations    during every orbit and is immediately \nforwarded to the Mission Control Centre located in Darmstadt for analysis.  \n\n    11.4.3.2.   On-board subsystems \n The power subsystem    include a deployable GaAs solar array    of 10 m 2  area, orientated \nby a solar array drive mechanism (SADM), a Li battery, and a power control    and \ndistribution unit, which controls the solar array, the battery\u2019s charge and distribution \nof power to the satellite platform    and instruments   . The satellite\u2019s power consumption    \nis 1,100 W (Figure  11.9 ).  \n\n Sentinel-3    possesses a satellite management unit (SMU), which includes a central \ncomputer that acts as the satellite\u2019s nerve center, controlling all the components \nneeded for the handling of commands, including the decoding and validation    of \nuplinked commands and the coding of \u201chousekeeping\u201d satellite data for downlink   . \nThe SMU also includes a data storage memory. The SMU controls the satellite \nthrough two mil-1553 buses. One supplementary \u201cSpacewire   \u201d high data throughput    \nbus connects the SMU to the payload data handling unit (PDHU). This bus is used \nfor providing the necessary data interchange needed for the monitoring and control \nof the instruments   . The SMU also includes point-to-point discrete connections to the \nattitude and orbit control    subsystem    (AOCS) components. \n\n Sentinel 3 telecommunication components include a fully redundant, low-speed \nS-band    up- and downlink communication subsystem    and a high-speed, 450 Mb/s \nX-band    subsystem for downlinking    of the satellite\u2019s instrument output, which is part \nof the payload data  fl ow. The S-band subsystem has two hemispherical low-gain \nantennas   , which provide communication with the ground, whatever the satellite\u2019s \nattitude.   \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n395The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\n    11.4.4.

All the satellites acting together provide rapid reaction and \nobservation capabilities that are especially valuable for the monitoring disasters and \nother swiftly changing events. DMC International Imaging Ltd., owned by SSTL, acts \nas central marketing agent and coordinates the utilization of the constellation with the \ndifferent members of the consortium. The satellites are all in a Sun-synchronous    orbit    \nat 640 km altitude.  \n\n    11.4.4.2.   Con fi guration \n Each SSTL-DMC    satellites is a three-axes-stabilized cube measuring approximately \n0.7 m side. They weigh ~90 kg and their average power consumption    is 50 W. All the \nsatellites in the constellation provide Earth    images in three bands with a spatial reso-\nlution    of 32 m, though several of them carry a supplementary panchromatic    camera \nwith a resolution of up to 4 m. The swath of the 32 m resolution channel is 640 km \n(Figure  11.10 ).   \n\n    11.4.4.3.   Operational concept and mission phases \n Each satellite can be operated either individually or as part of the overall constellation. \nIndividually, each owner has its own ground station and mission control    center to inter-\nact with its own satellite. The ground stations    are S-band    with an antenna 3.7 m in \ndiameter for telecommand    and telemetry   , as well as instrument downlinking   . Possessing \nidentical communication interfaces, any ground station in the system is capable of \naddressing any of the satellites, but in practice this is done only in emergencies or for \nexperimental purposes. Nonetheless, all the satellites can act together by interchanging \ntheir tasking plans to allow the central DMC    center to request images taken by one \nsatellite as required by the owner of another. Finally, each individual owner will gener-\nate and uplink    the tasking plans for its own satellite. That is, the different satellites \ncollaborate but the uplink of commands is handled exclusively by each owner. \n\n  Figure 11.10.

They can be rescheduled within 24 h (resources available), and imaging \nto downlink    times range from 10 min to 24 h depending on the location of the target and \nthe ground station. The time from data reception to product release varies from 4 h \n(not orthorecti fi ed) to 48 h (orthorecti fi ed using ground control points    to produce \nsubpixel accuracy). All ground stations    are connected via the Internet at 1 Mbit/s.  \n\n    11.4.4.4.   On-board subsystems \n The power subsystem    includes 4 GaAS body-mounted solar panels    feeding power to \nan unregulated bus (Figure  11.11 ).  \n\n Besides the difference in mass and cost   , the electronics    architecture of DMC    and \nSentinel-3    are almost identical. In the case of DMC, two Intel 80386-based OBC386 \ncomputers manage the satellite; the main one and a second one providing redundancy \nin case the main computer fails. The computers control the satellite through main and \nredundant CAN buses, which provide up to 388 kbit/s and point-to-point connections \nwhen higher speeds are needed. A GPS    receiver provides autonomous navigation and \na time reference. There are two redundant communication links: one low data-rate \nS-band    for up and down satellite command and control, and a high data-rate S-band, \n8 Mbit/s, for the instrument output. The uplink    is done at 9.6 kbit/s.    \n\n  Figure 11.11.

Allocation of functions \n\n This section will analyze the design decisions of the type \u201cwhat needs to be done?\u201d \nand \u201cwho does what?\u201d in the operational data  fl ow    of the satellite. \n\n    11.5.1.   Systematic versus interactive operations    \n\n As mentioned in Section   7.1    , the design process    starts with an idea for the operational \nneed of the mission directly derived from the phenomena under observation. Hence, \nthere is no decision about whether the mission is to be systematic or interactive; \nrather the nature of the observable    determines whether the mission operation shall be \ninteractive or systematic. Section   8.4.5     analyzed systematic versus interactive obser-\nvation    strictly from the point of view of the observable. The need for observation can \nbe either highly predictable, which favors a systematic observation    mode, or highly \nunpredictable, requiring an interactive mode. In addition to the mission\u2019s fundamen-\ntal aim of acquiring information, other activities must be performed as well, including \nthe satellite\u2019s launch, in-orbit con fi guration   , commissioning, and decommissioning. \nIn the past all of these activities are interactive. Nevertheless some of them, for \nexample, solar array    deployment and acquisition of the correct satellite attitude    could \nbe handled autonomously by the satellite. Satellites must also perform regular activi-\nties such as calibration    or orbital corrections    that can interrupt observations. If these \noperations are frequent, they will push the mission design toward autonomous and \nsystematic execution of these activities; if they are irregular and depend on unpredict-\nable factors, they will require interactive operation. We will now analyze in depth \nhow the systematic versus interactive alternatives function in the four missions out-\nlined above. \n\n Sentinel-3    will provide regular and consistent information about Earth   \u2019s entire \nsurface, including the open ocean, coastal zones, sea and land ice, inland waters, and \ndry land. Each surface requires distinct operational modes   . Over the ocean the radar \naltimeter    will operate with a lower resolution, while over coastal areas and inland \nwater, it will operate in a higher resolution, along-track \u201csynthetic aperture\u201d mode. \nAs far as the optical instruments    of Sentinel-3 are concerned, during the night, or \nwhen the Sun    is low over the horizon of observation, images that require substantial \nillumination by the Sun will be curtailed, though thermal infrared    images, which do \nnot depend on solar illumination, will continue to be gathered. The changing of the \nseasons, determined by the varying geometry of the Sun with respect to the Earth\u2019s \nsurface, and the presence and absence of ice, must also be taken into consideration \nwhen determining instrument modes. While it is evident that the issue of changing \ninstrumental modes is complex, they can all be programmed as functions of the \norbital position, the time of the year and the Earth\u2019s geography; that is, the changing \nfrom one operating mode to another depends on the data that can be programmed into \nthe satellite\u2019s intelligence; hence, modes can be made autonomous and systematic. \n\n Cluster    systematically analyzes regions of the magnetosphere   : the bow shock, the \nmagnetopause, and the polar cusp, according to the yearly cycle of relative positions \namong the satellite constellation\u2019s orbits, the Sun,    and the Earth   , as illustrated in \nFigure  11.2  and its accompanying text. Each magnetosphere region possesses unique \ncharacteristics, which require distinct modes from the observing instruments   . \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n399The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\nNevertheless, the boundaries between regions is less de fi ned and  fi xed than the \nboundaries encountered by Sentinel-3   . The Sun-magnetosphere interaction, not being \nfully predictable, will entail adjustments of the operational pro fi le to account for \nchanges in the exact position of the different boundaries. The distances maintained \namong the four Cluster satellites must occasionally be changed to enhance analysis \nof the  fi ne structure of the phenomena under observation. To cope with special events, \nfor example, sudden changes in solar activity   , sudden modi fi cations in the overall \npattern of operations must be made, such as those undertaken during a strong solar \nstorm that took place in November 2000. 13  Another signi fi cant factor is the adjust-\nments that need to be made as a result of the knowledge gained over the magneto-\nsphere as the mission proceeds, modi fi cations of the operational plan aimed at \nre fi ning the analysis of the phenomena being investigated. That is, as in the case of \nSentinel-3, Cluster\u2019s observing behavior depends on its orbital position and the \nchanging seasons; but unlike Sentinel-3, this overall pattern requires regular correc-\ntions. This entails a higher level of human interaction and ground segment    \nmodi fi cations to the regular overall planning. This explains the double loop of mis-\nsion planning   : the weekly and 6-monthly cycles described in Section  11.4.1 . \n\n SSTL-DMC   , as its name implies, is a constellation designed to deal with disasters, \nwhich are localized and unpredictable. This requires frequent changes in the satel-\nlites\u2019 image acquisition plans    to accommodate the changing requests of the consum-\ners   . It is always possible, however, to de fi ne \u201cbackground\u201d acquisition plans where \nimages over large areas are gathered in a systematic way. This systematic mode will \nbe adopted when there are no urgent or speci fi c requests. This de fi nes DMC as an \ninteractive mission with some elements of a systematic mission. In general, each \nground segment    creates the acquisition plan for its own satellite. In situations where \na rapid response is crucial, an image acquisition request can be sent to the central \nSSTL control center, which receives, consolidates, and forwards the request to the \n fi rst satellite in the constellation to reach the area of observation. Requests for acqui-\nsition of images also incorporate different levels of priority, as some acquisitions will \nbe more urgent than others. These factors, coupled with the project\u2019s large number of \nground stations    (one per satellite), results in very fast reaction    times. Even so,  fi nal \nauthorization for the uplinking    of commands will always rest with the owner of each \nindividual satellite, who can refuse to cooperate at any time, since the cooperation \nagreements are not legally binding   . DMC operations are strongly interactive, and \ndominated by the need to create and update changing operational plans. All these \nactivities are performed on the ground. This high level of on-ground activity permits \nthe designing of a relatively simple satellite with basic computing capacities and \nminimal on-board autonomy   . This is an example of a complex, interactive, and non-\nautonomous environment. \n\n Rosetta   \u2019s orbital track    is calculated with a high level of accuracy, and the exact \nmoment of its rendezvous    with the comet, as well as the planets    and asteroids it will \nencounter along its path are all known beforehand. Nevertheless, Rosetta must be \nresponsive to what it encounters when it makes its different rendezvous. Rosetta faces \na constantly changing environment and must adopt its behavior to what it encounters \n\n    13    Cluster    1 Year in Space, C. Escoubet, ESA Bulletin, August 2001.  \n\n\n\n400 Introduction to Space Systems\n\non its journey. Furthermore, the prolonged travel time needed for information to reach \nEarth    from the satellite requires the satellite to be able to make decisions on its own. \nThis is an example of an environment that is complex, interactive, and autonomous \nall at the same time.  \n\n    11.5.2.   Autonomy versus ground intervention \n\n The previous section discussed systematic versus interactive operations   . It was \nexplained that there is no trade-off    between systematic and interactive operations: the \nnature of the events under observation decides beforehand what option should be \nchosen. In this section we will discuss where the \u201cintelligence\u201d dealing with the pre-\ndictable or unpredictable operational changes should be located: to what extent it \nshould be on-board an autonomous satellite, or on the ground, requiring ground-based \ndecision making and frequent ground to space contact. The designer\u2019s autonomy    \nversus ground intervention    strategy will be in fl uenced by two con fl icting factors:\n\n   The need to increase mission robustness by allowing ground-based, human inter-\u2022 \nvention to correct anomalies and to cope with unexpected events  \n  The desire to reduce ground-based operation costs and to foster mission  fl exibility \u2022 \nby increasing satellite autonomy       \n\n Independent of the care taken during testing, all missions must confront numerous \non-board problems. These problems are normally identi fi ed early in the mission and \nare solved by the use of on-board software    updates and extensions. These software    \nproblems are generally associated with data handling    or attitude control   . To cope with \nthese issues the commissioning phase    of any space mission includes a high level of \nground intervention   . Anyway, already commissioned space missions could continue \nexperiencing nonnominal situations that would entail human intervention. \n\n The most perilous situation is a loss of attitude with respect to the Sun   , with the \nresulting power run-down and subsequent lack of contact with the ground. Satellites \nare very resilient, and ground intervention    is capable of recovering a theoretically \nlifeless satellite, as occurred in 1991 14  when Olympus remained in a nonoperational \nstate for 77 days, including 3 weeks of total silence. The satellite, including its espe-\ncially sensitive fuel and batteries   , withstood temperatures well outside its design \nspeci fi cations   . Nevertheless, the satellite was recovered and put again in operation. \nThis is a clear demonstration that no matter how autonomous a satellite is, it should \npermit maximum ground intervention during all phases of the mission, in order to \nfacilitate proper handling of unexpected events. The increasing pressure to reduce \nground operations costs, combined with the growing sophistication of computers, \nencourage the provision of autonomy    to satellites. This trend is supported by the \npossibility of increasing mission performance and  fl exibility by providing functions \nthat allow autonomous and intelligent satellite decisions. \n\n This need for autonomy    becomes obligatory for satellites operating in a changing \nenvironment far from Earth   , as we saw with Rosetta   . These two con fl icting but legitimate \n\n    14    ESA Achievements, BR 250, ESA 2005.  \n\n\n\n401The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\nin fl uences push in different directions. Satellite operation specialists will advocate a \nlow level of satellite autonomy   , and will point to numerous examples in which \nprompt human intervention made the difference between the success or failure of a \nmission. On the other hand, the increasing cost    of ground operations and the recent \nsophistication of on-board data handling    equipment encourage increasing autonomy. \nMany sources praise the virtues of autonomous satellite control as a way to cut costs, \nand argue that the largest enemy of operational autonomy is tradition. They are right, \nbut traditionalists also have a valid point; a single mission saved by human interven-\ntion compensates numerous cost reductions by the application of autonomy. SOHO \nwas nearly lost for good because they tried to reduce ground support with a software \npatch. Nevertheless, there is a clear tendency toward higher autonomy underscored \nby the need to reduce costs and the increasing performance of on-board data systems. \nIn-orbit autonomous orbit generation, image acquisition, orbit corrections, or the \nexecution of programmed calibration    are all increasing. Special missions aimed at \nfostering con fi dence in on-board autonomy have been undertaken: in Europe with \nPROBA satellites (proof of on-board autonomy); and in the USA with several \u201cNew \nMillennium\u201d projects including Deep Space One 15  and the Autonomous Science \nExperiment on board Earth observation    satellite EO-1. 16  EO-1 can autonomously \ndetect and respond to special events such as volcanic activity,  fl ooding, and water \nfreezing or thawing. \n\n In the case of Sentinel-3    all the functionalities required for nominal instruments    \noperations are located on the satellite. To make this possible, the satellite must carry \nhardware and software    that permit it to independently determine its position over the \nEarth    as well as the position of the Sun   . Sentinel-3\u2019s speci fi cations    require it to oper-\nate autonomously for at least 14 days. This level of autonomy    allows the use of a \nsingle ground station and infrequent operational contacts with the satellite. \nNevertheless, housekeeping telemetry   , monitoring the satellite\u2019s status, is included as \npart of the instrument data stream, which is downlinked    on every orbit. This permits \nfast reaction    times by mission operations    in cases where an anomaly forces contact at \nthe  fi rst possible opportunity. This approach allows low operating costs, especially \nimportant in a mission like that of Sentinel-3, which speci fi es an unusually long \noperational life    of 15 years. The accumulated cost    reductions associated with this \ntype of simpli fi ed operations are signi fi cant. \n\n Cluster   \u2019s orbit allows long periods of continuous contact with the Earth   ; neverthe-\nless, these periods of contact with the single ground station must be shared by the four \nsatellites making-up the Cluster system. In addition, at certain times of the day, poor \nalignment between the satellite and ground station prohibits proper contact. These \ntwo factors combined entail a moderate level of satellite autonomy   , allowing it to \noperate during intervals without ground contact. Originally, Cluster was to have been \nserved by two ground stations   , but the mission was eventually altered to operate with \njust one. 17  Two ground stations would have permitted almost continuous monitoring \nof the satellites, but the single ground station meant a signi fi cant reduction in the cost    \n\n    15    Mission Operations    with an Autonomous Agent, B.

The increase of on-board data processing and storage capabilities, \ncombined with the pressure for low-cost operations, prompted this change. \n\n DMC    operations are strongly interactive, and dominated by the need to create and \nupdate changing operational plans. These are all activities performed on the ground. \nAs mentioned above, this high level of on-ground activity enables a simple satellite \nwith a simple computer and without too much on-board intelligence to be used. All \ncomplex functions are located on the ground. Nevertheless, there is not a heavy \nup-front investment, because each new component of the satellite constellation comes \nwith its own ground segment   , which is included in the mission\u2019s overall budget. So the \nground segment expands naturally in step with the space segment. \n\n Rosetta    must be highly interactive and at the same time highly autonomous. \nIt requires a high level of intelligence both on the ground and in-orbit, and the design \nre fl ects that. One of Rosetta\u2019s cameras forms part of the attitude and orbit control    \nsubsystem   , allowing the satellite to identify the surrounding environment so the satel-\nlite can make autonomous decisions regarding the satellite\u2019s attitude and orbit. These \ninteractive and complex operations are compatible with long periods of little activity \nduring dormant phases. The satellite performs the necessary housekeeping activities \nduring these periods independently. \n\n It is easy to conceive of increasing levels of autonomy    for in-orbit operations   . One \npossibility is a meteorological observation system able to alter its behavior according \nto how the weather evolves; for example, to autonomously sample in more detail a \nregion with a developing storm. 18  The system could also react to requests for acquisi-\ntion patterns Also, in an emergency situation, in situ    staff could make direct requests \nfor the satellite to acquire and download images directly to them, thus bypassing the \nmission control    center. This is not only a sharing of information but also a sharing of \ncommand authority, which would necessitate the establishment of priority criteria for \nthe satellite to choose autonomously between con fl icting requests. Such a system \nwould need to develop not only new components with enhanced capabilities but \nwould also entail overcoming \u201cpolitical\u201d barriers, as it would disperse control over a \nvery expensive asset. Sharing authority over a satellite is as much a political issue \nas a technological one, and some consideration should be given to development of \ncollaborative environments that ease the dif fi culties of communicating across orga-\nnizations. Indeed, a system such as this presents numerous challenges regarding the \nevolution of organizational systems, and it involves technological advances as well. \nBut there is no doubt that fostering high levels of operational autonomy and the \nsharing of operational responsibilities will strongly improve the performance of \nspace systems.  \n\n    11.5.3.   Fast versus slow commanding \n\n Figure   8.17     depicted three time-related  fi gures of merit that the data produced by a \nspace mission can have: responsiveness   , revisit,    and data latency   .

This interval can be divided into two parts: the time \nneeded for the item\u2019s acquisition, and the time needed for delivery of the acquired \nitem to the consumer. The former will be discussed here, while the latter, as part \nof the instrument data processing    domain will be studied in detail in Section   12.4.3     \nof the next chapter. \n\n The need for rapid response to commands, depending on the urgency of the infor-\nmation, is maximized in missions studying dynamic events involving military and \ncivilian security, dynamic astronomical events, or in manned missions requiring com-\nplex, interactive, and real-time operations. The process to start the acquisition of \ncommanded observations requires the steps indicated in Figure  11.12 .  \n\n The acquisition time forms part of the satellite operations    cycle studied in this \nchapter. The acquisition of an image involves the following steps:\n\n    1.    The consumer needs time to contact the mission and make a request. The time \nneeded for this is a function of the tools provided by the mission operator for facili-\ntating requests: i.e., 24-h availability versus normal of fi ce hours, the use of web-\nbased request forms, etc.  \n\n    2.    The operator needs time to plot and program the set of commands needed by the \nsatellite. This will depend on the number and nature of received requests, their \npriority status, and the availability of tools for optimizing the acquisition plan and \nminimize waiting times, and for providing  fl exibility in the accommodation of \nhigh-priority last-minute requests. The outcome of this process is a list of com-\nmands to be uplinked to the satellite(s), and which optimizes the operations of the \nsatellite and the instruments.  \n\n    3.    The satellite receiving the uplinked list of orders must be visible to the relevant \nground stations   . The time needed is a function of the orbital trajectory of the satel-\nlite and the number and location of the commanding ground stations. As the number \nof satellites, their orbits and the number of ground stations and their locations are \nestablished, they directly determine delay times.  \n\nRequest Planning Uplink Orbit Acquisition n\n\nAcquisition delay\n\nTimeline to acquire \n\n  Figure 11.12.

Once the command has reached the satellite there will likely be an interval before \nthe satellite, following its predetermined orbital path   , achieves visibility of the \nrequested region or item of observation and acquires the requested image. This is \nalso a direct function of the orbits and number of satellites.     \n\n As far as the design of the operational data  fl ow    is concerned, to reduce acquisition \ntimes would entail an increase in the number of operational ground stations   , or the \nuse of data-relay satellites    for relaying orders to the relevant satellite or satellites. The \ngeosynchronous    mission IUE    was described in Section   7.2.1    ; the orbit and the num-\nber of ground stations    were chosen to allow continuous contact between the satellite \nand one of the two ground stations. For low Earth    orbit satellites, the most common \ncase, the number and location of ground stations needed for continuous contact \nbetween satellite and ground is impractical. This is why data-relay networks are \nsometimes used. One data-relay satellite, located in the geostationary position, is able \nto provide permanent links to any satellite located in low Earth orbit    for about 1/3 of \nthe orbital time. The European Artemis    19  mission is an example of this. One constel-\nlation of three or more well-distributed geostationary data-relay satellites   , as with the \nAmerican TRDSS,    20  permits almost permanent links from any satellite in low Earth \norbit to anywhere on Earth. Due to their equatorial geostationary position, and the \ntheir resulting geometry, even a full constellation of data-relay satellites loses contact \nfor brief periods with satellites  fl ying at very low altitude over the poles. Geostationary \nconstellations for data relay are expensive to design and maintain. As they represent \nsuch a heavy investment, they would likely be one choice among other, possibly more \npractical infrastructure options. Hence, the possible employment of data-relay satel-\nlites as part of the design process    will be among the system constrains provided \nby the mission sponsor   . The actual use of data-relay satellites is in fact rare, and none \nof the four missions discussed in this chapter uses data-relay satellites for \ncommanding. \n\n Data-relay satellites    allow almost real-time command and data delivery but the \nonly existing operational data-relay satellite constellation, TDRSS   , was designed \nwith manned  fl ights in mind, and all the other missions have lower priority. This has \nproduced a rather uneven scenario for the use of data-relay satellites    for commanding \n(Figure  11.13 ): \n\n   The Hubble    mission (Section  \u2022  7.2.1    ) uses TDRSS    for information downlink    but not \nfor satellite commanding.  \n  Landsat    7 mission operations    control center, located at NASA Goddard near \u2022 \nBaltimore, USA, can command the satellite using the TDRSS    network but down-\nlinking    is done directly to Landsat-7\u2019s own ground stations   .  \n  Landsat    5, on the other hand, downlinked    data through the TDRSS   . The TDRSS \u2022 \nnetwork is also used as instrument downlink    for Terra, Aqua, and Aura, but instru-\nment data downlinking    will be discussed in the following chapter.    \n\n It will always be possible to reduce the response time by providing a large number \nof well-placed ground stations   . This will be studied in the next section.  \n\n    19    ESA Achievements, BR-250, ESA 2005.  \n    20      www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/programs/tdrss/default.cfm      \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://www.spacecomm.nasa.gov/spacecomm/programs/tdrss/default.cfm\n\n\n405The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\n    11.5.4.   Number and location of operational ground station \n\n With the exception of the critical and brief early stages of a mission, when a large \nnumber of operational ground stations    are used, the number of operational ground \nstations    is normally quite small, and in a majority of cases only one station is used. \nThis accords with the desire for highly centralized satellite operations    discussed at the \nend of Section  11.5.2 , and with the need to reduce operational costs discussed in \nSections  11.5.1  and  11.5.2 . This tendency toward a small network of operational \nground stations has been steadily reinforced by technical advancements, permitting a \nhigher degree of on-board autonomy   . \n\n Cluster    performs all its communications, operational and instrument data down-\nlinking   , using a single station in Villafranca, near Madrid, Spain, which operates in \nthe S-band    for communications, in the 2,025\u20132,111 MHz band for uplinking    and in the \n2,200\u20132,290 MHz band for downlinking. \n\n Sentinel-3    uses different stations for operational and instrument data. The uplinking    \nand downlinking    of operational data is done using a single S-band    ground station in \nKiruna, which will be used rarely due to the mission\u2019s high level of autonomy   . \n\n Rosetta    uses also a single ground station, located in Perth (Australia) as its main \noperational center, but can resort to NASA\u2019s deep space    network in emergencies. \nTwo bands are used: the deep space S-band    for the uplink    and the deep space X-band    \nfor the downlink   . \n\n DMC    employs the same approach. Each satellite\u2019s owner has their own ground \nstation, and apart from the sharing of resources, the use of a centralized facility to \n\nOperational Ground Stations Data Downlink Ground Stations Data Relay\nGround Station\n\nGround flow of command and housekeeping data\n\nGround flow of instrument output data\n\nData relay satellite 1\nData relay satellite 2 \n\nLow earth orbit satellite\n\n  Figure 11.13.

The older ISO    and IUE    \nhad stations in both Europe and America; Cluster    was originally designed for two \noperational ground stations    but was  fi nally implemented with just one. NASA\u2019s deep \nspace    network of three ground stations    (in California, Spain, and Australia) offers \ncontinuous contact but, as explained in Section   7.2.1    , JWST    was designed to operate \nwith a single 4-h downlink    contact per day. \n\n The adequacy of operational ground stations    will be proportional to the number \nand duration of the opportunities of communications they provide. The number and \nduration of these opportunities will be a function of the satellite orbit ground track    \nand the location of the ground station. For example, low Earth   -orbiting satellites with \nvery high orbit inclination    will  fl y over the poles twice per orbit and ground stations    \nlocate at the poles will provide opportunities for contact with every orbit. The ground \ntrack of the orbit will de fi ne what are the best geographical locations for the ground \nstations of each mission and Section   12.4.5     will study the best location in a systematic \nfashion. Nevertheless, the location of an operational ground station is not just an issue \nof geographical optimization. Operational ground stations send commands to the \nsatellite that ensure its survival or that could produce its destruction. Therefore, most \noperational ground stations are located in places under close supervision by the owner \nof the satellite. Most of the time, the locations of the operational ground stations are \na constraint    provided by the mission sponsor   .  \n\n    11.5.5.   Orbit determination    and control functions allocation \n\n Orbital determination and control were previously examined in Section   9.1.2     as part \nof the chapter dealing with Orbit and Attitude Domain. That section introduced the \nvarious kinds of orbital maneuvers and different factors, such as injection errors   , \nnecessary orbital changes   , or unwanted orbit perturbations that make them necessary. \nAlso described were the tools necessary for determining the orbit, and it was noted \nthat, traditionally, orbits were determined via range-ranging    in the ground-to-satellite \ncommunications link. This allowed the ground control to determine the satellite\u2019s \nvelocity with respect to the satellite-to-ground station line of sight   . Nowadays, for \nsatellites in low Earth    orbit, it is also possible to determine orbit by including a GPS    \nor Galileo    navigation receiver onboard the satellite. Nevertheless, the standard prac-\ntice, even today, is for Mission Control to:\n\n   Calculate the satellite orbit using ranging    data and any other available information.  \u2022 \n  Compare the actual orbit with the nominal one.  \u2022 \n  Calculate and command the necessary orbit control    maneuvers, large or small.  \u2022 \n  Verify the outcome of the maneuvers once executed.    \u2022 \n\n As indicated in Section   9.1.2    , for low Earth orbits    it is perfectly possible for the \nsatellite to independently determine its orbit using navigation satellites such as GPS    \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\n\n\n407The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\nor Galileo   . Once the orbit has been determined it is also perfectly feasible to imple-\nment on board algorithms allowing the satellite to autonomously calculate, program, \nexecute, and check the necessary orbit correction    maneuvers. The advantages and \nshortcomings of autonomous operations were discussed in Section  11.5.2 . Clearly, \nautonomous operations reduce costs, but they also increase risks. \n\n Autonomous orbit determination    and control is especially advisable in cases \nrequiring frequent but minor orbit corrections, such as constellations that require \n fl ying in either tight or loose formation, or for satellites demanding particularly accu-\nrate control of their orbital paths. Opting for the autonomous execution of many small \nmaneuvers will reduce operations costs, while any individual minor autonomous orbit \ncorrection    is unlikely to represent a major risk    for the satellite. Major, sporadic cor-\nrections, however, are better performed under close ground control and rare orbital \ncorrections    are better performed under close ground control. \n\n During the early stages of mission de fi nition it is crucial to establish a basic orbit \ndetermination    and control philosophy and to adjudicate this function to either the \nsatellite, to the mission control,    or to both.   \n\n    11.6.   Allocation of performances \n\n    11.6.1.   Power budget \n\n Each of the electrical components on board a satellite consumes power. Moreover, \neach of them will have a power consumption    pro fi le; some, like the central computer, \nwill operate continuously, while others will feature different modes requiring differ-\nent power levels. Electronic units might have zero power consumption when off, low \npower consumption during \u201cstand-by\u201d mode prepared for swift reaction, and one or \nmore operational modes    with different power needs when performing different func-\ntions. All these factors must be taken into account when determining the overall \npower pro fi le for the satellite as a whole. This variable power demand must be pro-\nvided by the satellite\u2019s primary power source, that is, the solar array   , and by the \nsecondary power source, the batteries   . Ultimately, two budgets    will be needed:\n\n   An instantaneous power budget to ensure that both sources of electrical power (the \u2022 \nsolar array    and battery) are always able to deliver enough electrical power to ful fi ll \nthe needs of all the units operating at each moment  \n  An energy budget to ensure that the primary source of power, the solar array   , is \u2022 \nable to produce enough energy during each orbit to provide for all the satellite\u2019s \nenergy needs while engaged in fully recharging the battery during the illuminated \nportion of the orbit    \n\n It will be necessary to calculate as many different power and energy budgets    as \nrequired by the varying power demands and power production situations of the satellite \nduring all the different phases of its operational life   .\n\n   It must be veri fi ed that the satellite can assume the right attitude with respect to \u2022 \nthe Sun   , and can deploy and operate its solar array   , before the battery drains below \nits permissible minimum charge level.  \n\n\n\n408 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n  It must be veri fi ed that the satellite will have enough power and energy during \u2022 \nspecial situations such as major orbital changes    that could require the solar arrays    \nto point away from the Sun   .  \n  It must be veri fi ed that the satellite has enough power and energy during the special \u2022 \ngeometry and power demands of the safe mode   .    \n\n As in the case of masses (Table 10.4 of Section   10.6.1    ), power demand estimations \nmust include factors that take into account our ignorance regarding the actual  fi nal \ndemands of the electronic devises that will eventually be manufactured and put into \norbit. Early predictions of the power demands of electrical systems are highly unreliable, \nmuch more so than predictions about mass, and the use of very large margins is crucial. \n\n Different guidelines have been published by different sources outlining  fi gures to \nbe used as maturity factors    for deriving reliable power budgets    for the different stages \nof the project. For early de fi nition, the AIAA 21  applies the following guidelines \n(Table  11.2 ).  \n\n As already explained in Section   10.6.1    , class 1: is for a new spacecraft; class 2: for \na next generation spacecraft based on a previously developed family, which expands \nin complexity or capabilities within an established design envelope; and class 3: for \nproduction-level development, based on an existing design for which multiple units \nare planned and where a signi fi cant amount of standardization exists. The phases are \nas per Figure   1.5     and as per Section   6.3    . \n\n As far as energy production is concerned, its evolution over time will be a function of \nthe varying orbital geometry, which can be determined to a high degree of accuracy, \nand of the aging of the electrical subsystem\u2019s components, which is covered by the \napplication of known mission-life degradation factors. Solar arrays degrade over \ntime, and designs for the end-of-life phases of lengthy missions require a corresponding \nincrease in power budget. \n\n Various engineering specialists will contribute to power production forecasts, \nwhich, once the different safety and maturity factors    have been calculated, will deter-\nmine the solar array   \u2019s size. The accommodation of the required solar array is a satellite \ncon fi guration    issue and it has been discussed in Section   10.6.3    . \n\n Normally, large power consumers cannot reduce their power needs; active instru-\nments    like SARs    need power. There is no easy way to reduce power demands. In the \n\n      Table 11.2.

In balancing this budget we have the \nfollowing degrees of freedom by order of preference:\n\n   Increase the solar array    size to provide an energy budget within the desired mar-\u2022 \ngins. This is by far the best way to balance the power budget. This is only possible \nwhen the satellite con fi guration   , solar array quali fi cation limits, attitude control    \nlimits, and launcher    capacity permit the size increase.  \n  Increase solar array    size by extending it beyond its quali fi cation envelope. This \u2022 \nintroduces some risk    and will entail supplementary quali fi cation testing, but the \noriginal design might allow the increase.  \n  Improve the technology by employing more ef fi cient solar cells    or batteries   , fully \u2022 \nregulated buses,    or a more ef fi cient control of the solar array   .  \n  Try to run the solar array    colder, which increases ef fi ciency. This requires a more \u2022 \nsophisticated thermal design    around the solar array.  \n  Identify subsystems that require too much power. Two possible sources are the \u2022 \nthermal subsystem    and the harness. In large satellites, increasing bus voltage will \nreduce mass as well as losses in the harness.  \n  Reduce instrument consumption. This will likely involve degradation of mission \u2022 \nperformance and should be avoided.  \n  Employ a larger launcher    to accommodate a larger solar array   . Serious cost    \u2022 \nimpacts make this a last resort.    \n\n Designing a solar array    that meets mission requirements    usually presents no \ndif fi culties. If problems occur, however, they are among the hardest to solve because \nthe maximum size of the  fi xed solar array is determined by the chosen launcher    \ncapacity, and the power demands by the required satellite performances and both are \nvery dif fi cult to change.  \n\n    11.6.2.   Communications    link budgets \n\n Link budgets are calculations that verify that the power of the signal arriving to the \nreceiving antenna is strong enough for the information encoded in the signal to be \nrecovered. \n\n The following factors will enhance the link budget   :\n\n   The power of the signal emitted by the satellite or the ground station. In the case of \u2022 \nthe satellite this factor is limited by the availability of technology for power \nampli fi cation, by the capability of the satellite power subsystem to satisfy the emitter \ndemands, and by the International Telecommunication Union (Section  11.1.3 ) regu-\nlations on the maximum energy density arriving on Earth    from satellites. In the case \nof the ground stations    the power will be limited by the availability of ground stations \nwith powerful transmitters.  \n  The gain of the satellite antenna. High-gain antennas    concentrate the signal into a \u2022 \nnarrow beam, which improves the strength    of the emitted signal on-ground. The \nlarger the gain the larger the antenna and the gain will be limited by the resulting \naccommodation constraints of a large antenna on the satellite. The accommodation \nof Rosetta   \u2019s antenna, depicted in Figure  11.6 , is a good example of this. Moving \nto higher frequencies permits smaller antennas, thus reducing accommodation \n\n\n\n410 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nproblems; nevertheless, higher frequencies require complex advanced hardware \nthat could call for dedicated development.  \n  The gain of the ground station antenna. The larger the antenna the higher the gain. \u2022 \nThe large ground stations    used for Rosetta   \u2019s communications, described in \nSection  11.4.2 , are prime examples. NASA DSN stations have a diameter of 70 m. \nThe limiting factor here would be their availability and cost   , since ground stations \nwith large antennas are rare, and expensive to build, maintain, or rent.  \n  The ground station receiving quality expressed by its system gain to noise tempera-\u2022 \nture ratio G/T noise  fi gure   . This quality factor behaves in a way similar to antenna \ngain   ; better antennas improve the situation but are more expensive to operate and \nare less common.  \n  The use of enhanced coding schemes    to protect against bit error. This allows the \u2022 \ncorrect recovery of transmitted data with low receiving powers. The use of Reed \nSolomon or convolutional codes is now widespread. CCSDS    regulations recom-\nmend speci fi c codes to be used.    \n\n The following factors degrade the link budgets   :\n\n   The speed of data being recovered. The larger the amount of information, in bit/s, \u2022 \nbeing transmitted, the larger the amount of power needed to recover it with a low \nbit error rate. Operational data  fl ow are normally modest. The problems associated \nwith the transmission of very high data rates, which is a problem speci fi c to the \ndownlink    of instrument data, will be covered in Chapter   12    .  \n  Losses in the satellite emitting subsystems. Choosing the best quality hardware \u2022 \ncan reduce this loss; however, it is generally small.  \n  Losses due to mispointing of the satellite antenna. This factor is important where \u2022 \nhigh-gain antennas are employed. To reduce this loss it is necessary to provide a \nhigh-accuracy antenna pointing mechanism and a correspondingly accurate atti-\ntude pointing system for the satellite. High-accuracy pointing mechanisms    for \nhigh-gain, large-sized antennas are complex and expensive, as are high-accuracy \nattitude pointing systems.  \n  Free space progressive attenuation, that is, the unavoidable dispersion of the signal \u2022 \nbeam as it travels along its path from the satellite to the ground station, is by far \nthe dominant loss in the link budget   . It depends on the distance between the satel-\nlite and the ground station and is thus directly determined by the orbit selection, \nwhich is directly driven by the needs of the consumers   . The orbit chosen and the \nresulting satellite-to-ground distance will govern the link budget.  \n  Attenuations due to the atmosphere, including attenuations due to water vapor and \u2022 \nrain. These are unavoidable factors that the design must incorporate. They are \ngreater at higher frequencies and when the satellite is low over the horizon. These \nattenuations limit the satellite\u2019s minimum elevation above the horizon needed for \nsuccessful data interchange.  \n  Losses due to mispointing of the receiving antenna. The pointing accuracy    of any \u2022 \nground station is always commensurate with its dimension; the larger the antenna \ndiameter, the larger the antenna gain   , and so the highest pointing accuracy. Cost is \nthe main limiting factor, as large diameter, high-accuracy ground antennas are rare \nand expensive to operate.    \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12\n\n\n411The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\n The distance between the satellite and Earth    varies widely according to the nature \nof the mission and the type of orbit used. This will be discussed further below. \n\n    11.6.2.1.   Flying near earth    \n An important design consideration in operational communications is that the link \nshall be possible regardless of the satellite\u2019s attitude, that is, even with the satellite \nout of nominal orientation or while tumbling. This implies that the on-board opera-\ntional communication antenna must be omnidirectional. Two hemispherical coverage \nantennas normally provide this. Sentinel-3   , SSTL-DMC   , Cluster,    and Rosetta    all \nemploy a pair of hemispherical antennas providing contact with the satellite regard-\nless of its orientation. The data stream speed necessary to take control of a satellite is \nmodest; that means, the low antenna gain    associated to the hemispherical antennas is \nnot a problem. \n\n Housekeeping data streams are normally small. Nevertheless, if housekeeping and \nscience downlinks are mixed, as they are in space science   , the data streams will be \nlarger. Near to Earth   , very high data streams are compatible with moderate gain, \nmoderate-size antennas. Sentinel-3    downlinks information at 450 Mbit/s but uses \nwide- fi eld-of-view antennas. Cluster   \u2019s antennas, as described in Section  11.4.1 , also \nprovide hemispherical coverage and are fully capable of downlinking    all the informa-\ntion, including both housekeeping and instrumental, produced by the mission. In \nmissions  fl ying near to Earth the data speed is compatible with wide- fi eld-of-view \nantennas.  \n\n    11.6.2.2.   Deep space missions \n In this type of mission the large losses associated with the long distances between the \nsatellite and Earth    presents an entirely different scenario. The power arriving at the \nreceiving antenna decreases with the square of the distance, and this degrades the link \nbudget   . To compensate for this, it is possible to increase the antenna emitting power   , \nthough any improvement will be limited by the resulting power demands of the satel-\nlite. In deep space    missions, it is essential to use the largest ground antennas, with the \nhighest gain, pointing accuracy,    and quality. There are few stations suitable for this \npurpose, and building new ones is a major and costly endeavor beyond the means of \nsingle projects. This is a general infrastructure investment for use by many projects. \nMission designers are forced to choose from existing facilities, which means that \nselecting the ground stations    for a deep space mission is not a design decision but \nrather a mission constraint   . The only really free design parameter is the satellite \nantenna\u2019s gain   . Large, high-gain communication antennas    dominate the con fi gurations \nof deep space missions like Rosetta   , in Figure  11.6 , or Ulysses   , in Figure   10.17    . \n\n Satellites at great distances from Earth    will use with advantage long contact times \nwith ground stations    because the amount of data produced by a mission will be higher \nin cases where longer downlink    times are permitted. A limiting factor is that it is \nimpractical to fully book a ground station for a single satellite. The few ground sta-\ntions capable of receiving data from remote satellites must share their time among all \nthe deep space    probes needing their services. Hence, the time available for downlink-\ning    is not a technical decision, but rather a programmatic constraint    resulting from \nnegotiations between the various space missions simultaneously requiring the ground \nstation\u2019s services. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n412 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n Whatever the tools used to improve the link of a deep space    mission, the amount \nof data transmitted will be small in comparison with the consumer   \u2019s wishes. The \nscienti fi c community would appreciate submeter resolution images of the large areas \nof Mars   , and cameras exist with that capability, but there is no way to transmit the \nhundreds of Mbit/s 22  of resulting data throughput    to Earth   . This  fi gure contrasts with \nthe few kbit/s that is currently feasible. Inevitably then, the science to be performed \nwill be limited by data downlink   \u2019s unavoidable limitations. To alleviate this problem, \nefforts at all levels are needed, most fundamentally antennas with improved gain both \nin orbit and on the ground. On the ground it is possible to use arrays with a large \nnumber of medium-sized antennas. 23  Nevertheless, the heavy penalty in mass and \nvolume inherent to deep space missions, and the heavy investment needed for large \narrays of ground antennas, makes the solution to this problem especially dif fi cult. \n\n In the previous discussion about near-Earth    satellites, reference was made to the \nproblems associated with out-of-control satellites or those in any other emergency \nsituation. This also applies to deep space    satellites. To cope with these problems deep \nspace missions also include wide- fi eld-of-view links. As shown in Figure  11.8 , \nRosetta    includes a pair of full coverage S-band    antennas and a medium-gain S-/X-\nband    antenna. NASA\u2019s mission Galileo    24  was a complete success despite the failure \nof its high-gain antennas. All the data produced by the mission were slowly down-\nlinked    to Earth through a wide- fi eld-of-view communications link not originally \ndesigned for this purpose. This is a good example of the capacity of a mission to \nprovide service beyond its speci fi ed range, i.e., a robust system design.   \n\n    11.6.3.   Computer load budget \n\n The computing power of processors on board the satellite must be compatible with the \nprocessing load, which is a function of the level of autonomy   , and of the complexity of \nthe satellite. The factors driving the number and functions of the on-board computers    \nwere discussed in Section  11.1.2 . Given the large degree of uncertainty in the early \nstages of a project, very large safety margins    for computer processing power, software    \nsize, satellite monitoring, and control memory are crucial. During the early design \nphases, safety factors of at least two are perfectly reasonable. This budget normally does \nnot present complicated interfaces and can be left safely in the hands of the specialist.  \n\n    11.6.4.   Operational on-board storage \n\n Operational mass memory for housekeeping data    needs is normally moderate. The \nmemory required for on-board storage of the data produced by the instrument is much \nlarger and will be discussed in the next chapter. The operational memory must store \noperational on-board software    and operational procedures for long periods of time as \n\n    22    Evolution of the Communications System and Technology for Mars Exploration, Ramon de Paula et al., \nActa Astronautica Vol 51, Pergamon Elsevier 2002.  \n    23    Low Cost    Architectures for Large Arrays of Small Antennas Dayton Jones, IEEE AC paper #1199, \nIEEE 2005.  \n    24      http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/pro fi le.cfm?MCode=Galileo         \n\nhttp://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Galileo\n\n\n413The Operational Data Flow Domain\n\nrequired to perform the satellite\u2019s functions. The operational memory also stores the \ncommands sent to the satellite by the mission control    center. The storage capacity \nshall be determined by the frequency of updating of commands plus a safety margin \nin case of failure in the uplink   . The mass memory must also store all the data related \nto monitoring the satellite\u2019s status and the instrument and housekeeping data. This \ndata will be downlinked    at each opportunity to the operational ground station, though \nit could also be downlinked together with the data produced by the instruments    during \nthe normally more frequent instrument data output downlinks. Given the high degree \nof uncertainty in the early determination of the sizing parameters, on-board storage is \ncalculated with safety margins    of at least two, as described in the previous section. \nIn some cases it is desired that all housekeeping data be downlinked.  \n\n    11.6.5.   Data acquisition delay budget \n\n The total time delay between image acquisition request and image delivery was \ndiscussed in Section   8.4.6    . The system acquisition delay    part that is relative to the \noperational data  fl ow    has been discussed in Section  11.5.3 . The mission speci fi cation \nwill apportion the overall delay between all their contributors. This apportioning will \nestablish a requirement for the response time necessary for the end-to-end system to \nstart the acquisition of the data requested. The speci fi ed delay time shall be divided \nand apportioned to the factors contributing to it as indicated in Figure  11.12 :\n\n    1.    The time allocated for reception of the consumer   \u2019s request, which can be reduced \nby computerized fast handling of the requests  \n\n    2.    The time allocated for the planning of the mission that can be improved by \nenhanced computerized handling supplemented with human supervision  \n\n    3.    The time needed for the ground station to uplink    the information to the satellite, \nwhich is fully determined by the orbit, the number and location of the ground \nstations    and the possible employment of data-relay satellites    for commanding  \n\n    4.    The delay in acquiring the information, which depends on the  fi rst opportunity for \nobserving the relevant location offered by the orbital path    plus the time necessary \nfor the satellite to  fi nish acquiring the data requested     \n\n Steps 3 and 4 are fully determined by the orbital geometry and the de fi nition of the \narea to be acquired and do not require safety margins   . The overall delay of steps 1 \nand 2 will depend on the total time allocated for all the steps minus the time needed \nto perform 3 and 4. The time remaining for the execution of step 1 plus 2 will be used \nfor the speci fi cation of the handling of the consumer   \u2019s request and for the mission \noperations    including the planning of the observations. As mentioned above in \nSection  11.2 , the early designs for a space system do not include a detailed physical \ndesign    of the ground segment   , but instead focuses on the functional design   . Ground \nprocessing experts will be able to advise the architect    if the values allocated provide \ncomfortable margins and are compatible with the existing and likely evolution of the \nground segment capabilities. These delay values will also be crucial to the estimation \nof operational costs, needed to establish a credible cost    estimation for the end-to-end \nmission because fast and permanent handling of consumer requests is expensive to \nimplement. The provision of cost estimations will also be in the hands of the ground \nsegment specialist.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n414 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n    11.6.6.   Level of service and availability budget \n\n The objective of satellite missions is to acquire the information requested by the \nconsumers   . The organization of satellite operations   , including interfaces with the \nconsumer   , must maximize the time dedicated to this fundamental task. This factor \nwill determine the level of service offered by the mission, and has two aspects:\n\n   What percentage of time can consumers    request speci fi c observations?  \u2022 \n  What percentage of the total time are the instruments    actually acquiring data?    \u2022 \n\n Offering a high degree of availability    to consumers    entails the creation and main-\ntenance of structures that permit them to request information at any moment, without \nlimitations. The satellite requires time to perform procedures such as orbit correction   , \nmaintenance, or monitoring that may interrupt data acquisition. Some missions \nrequire a high level of availability, while others possess varying degrees of tolerance \nto interruptions in data gathering. Generally, interactive missions require fast reaction    \ntimes as well as high levels of availability, while systematic missions studying non-\ndynamic events are more  fl exible regarding temporary data interruptions. However, \nsystematic missions studying dynamic events, such as meteorological satellite mis-\nsions, also demand the highest level of availability. Availability requirements    higher \nthan 95% for meteorological mission are perfectly reasonable. \n\n The requirements    on system availability    and level of service must be apportioned \nbetween all the factors contributing to interruptions of the services. The apportioned \nvalues will determine the design of numerous elements of the mission, including orbit \ncontrol    tools, orbit control frequency, the need for special calibrations forcing the \ninterruption of the mission, or the possible need for a permanent mission control    team \navailable 24 h per day and 7 days per week. \n\n It is evident that design decisions necessary for providing high availability    levels \nwill have a major impact on operation costs and must be taken into account if a credible \ncost    estimation for the mission as a whole is to be formulated.         \n\n\n\n415M.A. Aguirre, Introduction to Space Systems: Design and Synthesis, Space Technology Library 27, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_12, \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n           Keywords   Instrument Data Flow,   Satellite Ground Segment,   Satellite Data \nProcessing,   Satellite Data Distribution,   Satellite Data Storage,   Satellite Users Interfaces,  \n Data Volume Budget,   Users Data Request,   Users Data Delivery,   Data Latency    \n\n This    domain was introduced in Section   7.1.5    . This chapter starts with a brief \nintroduction to the elements and components \u2013 ground and space \u2013 included in \nthis domain. As it is strongly related to the previous chapter, the present chapter \nwill use as examples three space missions already discussed in Chapter   11    : \nRosetta   , Cluster,    and Sentinel-3   , as well as a new one, NOAA POESS   . NOAA \nPOESS produces very large amounts of data that need to be processed at high \nspeed, and uses four different paths for data downlink    and processing. This makes \nit an interesting mission to analyze. \n\n In Chapter   11     the key point of discussion was how autonomous the operations of \nthe mission should be. In this chapter and recalling the three categories of mission \neffectiveness    of Figure   5.8     \u2013 data quality, data quantity, and system responsiveness    \n\u2013 the main points of discussions will be the data quantity and the latency aspect of \nsystem responsiveness   . \n\n The topics covered in this chapter are those indicated on the right-hand side of \nFigure   7.4     expanded here in Figure  12.1 .  \n\n The instruments    data handling    will be discussed in Section  12.1.1 , the data down-\nlink    in Section  12.1.2 , the payload ground stations    in Section  12.2.1 , and the payload \nprocessing and users services in Section  12.2.2 . The next section will analyze the four \nabove-mentioned mission examples. As Chapter   11    , this chapter will  fi nish with two \nsections analyzing the allocation of functions    and allocation of budgets    included in \nthis domain. \n\n    12.1.   In-orbit components involved in the domain \n\n    12.1.1.  Instrument output data handling \n\n These components capture, digitize, store, and process the output of the instruments   . \nThe instrument data handling    must also process supplementary data, for example, \n\n    Chapter 12   \n\n The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain          \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n416 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nsatellite attitude   , position, or time of acquisition, indispensable for the correct inter-\npretation of the acquired data. \n\n The necessary components are the same as those described in Section   11.1.2    : \ngeneral-purpose and dedicated processors, storage memories, and data buses   . The \ndifference is that modern instruments    can produce huge amount of data; one modern \nSAR    instrument can produce several hundred Mbits per second of operation. This \nhigh data rate requires speci fi c solutions for data processing distribution and storage. \nApplication-speci fi c integrated circuits (ASIC\u2019s) and fast analog-to-digital converters \nare developed for the capture and digitization of the information  fl ow produced by the \ninstruments. High-speed data buses like Spacewire,    1  based in IEEE 1355, can provide \ndata transfer speeds as high as 400 Mbit/s. Digital signal processors or dedicated \ngeneral-purpose computers can also be used for processing the instruments\u2019 output. \nThe on-board storage of large amounts of data requires the use of large solid-state \nmass memories   . It is essential that these storage devices be capable of working in the \nhigh radiation space environment    with high reliability. This requires the development \nof radiation-hardened modules, which include error detection, correction components \nand redundancy. \n\n The fundamental design decisions are all connected with the amount of data pro-\nduced by the instruments   , which is driven by the requirements    of the observables   .

These decisions are especially \nimportant for the design of the mass memory, which can be a heavy item requiring \nlarge amounts of mass and power. Newer memories always offer larger data stor-\nage capacities using smaller and lighter components, but they cannot be  fl own \nwithout the necessary evaluation and development to verify their adequacy for \nworking in space. \n\n The implementation of on-board instrument data processing    is also an important \ndecision of the highest level of signi fi cance. On-board processing, including data \ncompression   , can reduce and simplify the data storage and transmission problem, but \nnot all applications can tolerate data compression. Irreversible data compression \nalgorithms should be avoided for scienti fi c and advanced applications. All new space \ndevelopment results in the discovery of unexpected applications, so access to the \nuncompressed raw data is essential. The use of interferometric SAR    images for deriv-\ning the displacement of the Earth   \u2019s crust before and after earthquakes is a good \nexample of an important application that was not considered when the satellite was \nbeing designed. \n\n Irreversible on-board data processing could destroy information that eventually \nmight become crucial. On the other hand, irreversible data compression    can be toler-\nated for well-characterized applications, where the amount of information lost during \ncompression is known. This is often the case in operational missions   . \n\n The hardware shall be selected from a small set of available \u201cspace compatible\u201d \ncomponents either already ready or in the course of development, while design deci-\nsions will normally be in the hands of the specialist engineers. However, the decision \non the overall architecture and the sharing of functions between the different compo-\nnents of the architecture is in the hands of the architect   .  \n\n    12.1.2.   Instrument data output downlink \n\n The data output downlink    components code, encrypt, modulate, amplify, and transmit \nto Earth    the information produced by the instrument and satellite and are required for \nthe correct processing of the instrument data stream. \n\n The components used for the instruments downlink    are the same as those described \nin Section   11.1.3    : encoders, ampli fi ers, modulators, and antennae. The difference is \nthat the very high data rate calls for the use of speci fi c design solutions and further \nlimits the availability of hardware adequate to the relevant functions. In line with the \nfrequency limitations explained in Table   11.1    , the bands allowed for instrument data \ndownlink as well as the allowable bandwidth    and the maximum power  fl ux density    \narriving to the Earth    surface are speci fi ed by ITU    regulations and must be respected. \nThis will introduce further design limitations. High data throughput    downlinks must \nuse ef fi cient modulation schemes capable of carrying as much information per Hz of \nused bandwidth as possible. In cases where the information produced by the instru-\nments    is of a sensitive nature, for example, high-resolution images with intelligence \npotential, the inclusion of special components for the encryption of information \nbecomes essential. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n418 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n One way to increase the data throughput    is to increase the frequency of the car-\nrier of the data stream. Earth observation    satellites use the X-band    but could use \nthe Ka-band    in cases where higher speed was needed, because there is a higher \nbandwidth    available in that range. It is also possible to use optical data links. \nOptical data links could be used to beam information to ground stations    or for \nsending it to data relay satellites    in the geostationary position. The Earth observa-\ntion mission Spot    5 uses an optical link to the geostationary communications satel-\nlite Artemis   . The problem with optical links to ground is the high atmospheric \nattenuation and that clouds or haze will interrupt the communication links. Inter-\nsatellite links, on the contrary, are free of this problem and greatly bene fi t from \noptical links \n\n It is also common with this type of application to use different downlink    chains for \ndifferent types of consumers   . NOAA POESS    currently uses four different data down-\nlinks to send data from the satellite to ground. Each one features its own dedicated \nencoding, modulation, and ampli fi cations, as well as antenna. This is described in \nSection  12.3.4 . \n\n The  fi rst and most important design decision is how many and how fast the data \ndownlinks shall be, and what the resulting ampli fi er power and antenna gain    of each \none of the downlink    paths should be. The ampli fi er power will be limited by the avail-\nability of equipment. The availability of ampli fi ers and the distance from satellite to \nground station will also determine whether a high-gain antenna is needed or not. If \npointable high-gain antennae are used the pointing    concept must be selected: mechan-\nical or electronic. This will drive the mechanical accommodation design solution for \nthe antennae. \n\n Another important decision is whether or not to use data encryption   . This is a \nprogrammatic constraint    that is provided to the designer as a compulsory guideline. \nThe domain specialist selects the coding and encryption algorithms. The use or not of \nencryption will also impact the transmission power required. \n\n There is not a great variety of hardware capable of ful fi lling these demanding \nfunctions. Furthermore, many design features in this area are strongly regulated: the \nfrequency to be used for the downlink   , density of power in the downlink, bandwidth    \nallocated, algorithms for coding, and the standards for the packing of the data streams. \nAll these factors combined limit the freedom of the designer. Nevertheless, these \nlimits are counterbalanced by the freedom to select the overall data downlink archi-\ntecture and allow quite different sets of solutions for very similar missions. This is a \ndesign area where the architect    has to be proactive. The specialists will always pro-\nvide the best design solutions compatible with the chosen architecture, but it is the \nduty of the architect to provide the architecture with the number and speed of the \ndifferent data paths.   \n\n    12.2.   On-ground components involved in the domain \n\n As in the case of operational data  fl ow   , the instrument on-ground components are \nnormally not designed for the particular mission being designed, but are selected \nwithin an already existing infrastructure that has been implemented for use by several \nspace missions. This is made possible by the use of widely accepted standards for the \n\n\n\n419The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\nlinking of information from space to ground. A supplementary factor encouraging the \nuse of existing elements is the existence of many ground stations    that can provide \nservices to the satellite. The reception and delivery of payload data is much less criti-\ncal than the commanding or monitoring of the satellite, that is why it is considered \nperfectly acceptable to use ground stations and data networks not under the direct \ncontrol of the mission owner. One interesting exception to the use of existing infra-\nstructure is the SafetyNet   \u2122 2  concept of NOAA POESS    that was created for the \nspecial needs of this operational meteorological project. This system is discussed in \nSection  12.3.4 . \n\n As detailed in the previous chapter, during the preliminary design phase prior to \nprogram approval, it is vital to perform a functional design    of the ground segment   , \nbut unnecessary to perform a physical design   ; therefore, only functional design will \nbe covered in this subsection. \n\n    12.2.1.   Instrument downlink ground stations and data relay satellites \n\n Ground stations    and data relay satellites    transfer the large amount of information \nproduced by the instruments    from the satellite to the processing centers   . In the case \nof centralized instrument data processing   , the level of processing performed in the \nstations is usually small: the data are demodulated, decoded, and separated into data \nstreams and each stream is sent to its speci fi c processing center   . It is perfectly pos-\nsible to perform these functions with the data encrypted until it arrives at the  fi nal \nprocessing center. This would be advisable in cases where the owner of the space \nsystem does not control the ground stations    under discussion. \n\n In some cases the instrument data processing    is decentralized and each ground \nstation will possess its own data processing and mission products    derivation compo-\nnents. The NOAA POESS    Direct Readout Mission is a good example of this \napproach, and will be described in Section 12.3.4   . \n\n The fundamental design decision on this area encompasses how many ground sta-\ntions    and how many classes of ground stations are required, and if data relay satellites    \nwill be used. The design will be driven by the amount of data produced and the result-\ning data throughput    requirements   , in addition to the acceptable data latency. It is \nnecessary to recall that maximum data downlink    speeds will be  fi nally limited by the \nfrequency allocated by the ITU    regulations as provided in Table   11.1    . \n\n Another important decision is what tools will be used to transfer the data from the \nground station to the processing centers   . Ground stations    are often in dif fi cult-to-\nreach places like Antarctica or Svalbard in the Arctic, which are very well situated \nfor downlinking    data from high-inclination Earth    observation    satellites. Svalbard has \noptical data links connecting it to mainland Europe, but the only way to relay the data \nfrom Antarctica is via communication satellites   . \n\n Determining the downlink    data  fl ow and the number of ground stations    is another \ndesign decision where the architect    has to be proactive. Downlink speeds are limited \nby regulations, the use of a large number of ground stations is expensive, data relay \n\n   2    Latency    Features of SafetyNet   \u2122 Ground Systems Architecture NPOESS   , James Duda et al., Proceedings \nof SPIE Vol. 5659, 2005.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n420 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nsatellites    are rare, and consumers    may require downlinking    of very large amounts of \ndata. This is the typical situation of con fl icting needs that must be balanced by the \narchitect after taking into account all the con fl icting factors. \n\n The number of ground stations    and the use or not of data relay satellites    is also \nstrongly in fl uenced by nontechnical program constraints. Ground stations    and data \nrelay satellites are expensive infrastructures built to last for many years and to service \nmany satellites. It is inevitable that the  fi nal design decision shall be made based \nstrongly on the use of existing infrastructures. Cost considerations become a major \nfactor in de fi ning the  fi nal architecture.  \n\n    12.2.2.   Payload data segment \n\n The payload data segment    processes the data produced by the satellite and distributes \nit to the mission\u2019s data consumers   . The essential functions include:\n\n   Processing of the information, to derive the required mission data products  \u2022 \n  Control and management of facilities related to the instrument\u2019s data  fl ow  \u2022 \n  Long-term storage of instrument output and all other information relevant to the \u2022 \ncorrect interpretation of this output  \n  Interfacing with consumers   , receiving requests and delivering mission products       \u2022 \n\n Processing the data produced by the satellite requires the calibration    and validation    \nof the output of the instrument. The Committee in Earth Observation    Satellite \n(CEOS) de fi nes calibration 3  as \u201cThe process of quantitatively de fi ning the system \nresponses to known, controlled signal inputs\u201d and validation as \u201cThe process of \nassessing, by independent means, the quality of the data products derived from the \nsystem outputs.\u201d To calibrate means testing and adjusting the accuracy of the measur-\ning instruments   . To ensure their accuracy the instruments carry devices that monitor \ntheir environment, and can correct the sensitivity of the instrument by checking the \ntemperature of its detecting elements, or by identifying deviations in the instrument\u2019s \nbehavior by comparing the instrument\u2019s output to well-characterized inputs. This has \nbeen already discussed in Chapter   8     when analyzing instruments. Further qualitative \nimprovements can be obtained by comparing the instrument\u2019s results with results \nprovided by similar instruments in other satellites observing the same events. In some \ncases it is possible to perform \u201cin situ   \u201d determination of the parameters under obser-\nvation that can be compared with the read-outs provided by the instruments. System \nvalidation will involve activities that include the use of references external to the \nspace system itself. Validation shall be used to provide absolute references of quality. \nEach instrument\u2019s measurement must also be geo-referenced to a speci fi c location \n(Section   9.9.3    ) on Earth or on the celestial sphere   . To perform this function the pay-\nload data segment    needs data on the satellite\u2019s position and attitude at speci fi c times \nused by the system\u2019s space and ground segments. After calibration and referencing, \nthe data will be processed according to special algorithms to produce information \n\n   3     http://wgcv.ceos.org/wgcv/wgcv.htm#defs      \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://wgcv.ceos.org/wgcv/wgcv.htm#defs\n\n\n421The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\nwith an increasing level of relevance to the analysis of the physical reality of the \nevents under observation. \n\n The data processing will normally have two levels:\n\n   A  fi rst set of basic data processing that produces calibrated and geo-referenced \u2022 \n(Section   9.10.4    ) \u201cbasic\u201d data. This processing will be common and necessary to \nall applications that will use the data produced by the mission.  \n  A second set of data processing that will be different and optimized for each pos-\u2022 \nsible use of the mission data. This second level of processing would normally \nrequire the use of large amounts of data external to the system that will increase \nthe value of the resulting products.    \n\n Data processing sometimes requires the acquisition of external information. The \npayload data segment    should be able to acquire any needed external information. All \ndata provided to consumers    must be quality controlled. The calibrated and located \ndata, once controlled for quality, must be provided with the speed and in the mode \nrequired by the consumer   . \n\n The payload data segment    requires the handling and management of large amounts \nof data from many sources, some of them external to the space system. This requires \nthe establishment and maintenance of adequate interfaces. Of special relevance is the \npayload data center    interface with mission operations   . Mission operations    will pro-\nvide information on the status of the satellite relevant to improving mission products    \nquality to the payload data center. In addition, the payload data center, by controlling \nthe quality of mission products, could provide information on possible malfunctions \nto the mission operations center   . The payload data center is also normally the place \nwhere instrument use and image acquisition plans    are established; nevertheless, this \nfunction should be shared with the mission control    center, which commands a better \nview of the overall status and capabilities of the satellite. The data quality control \nfunction may sometimes be allocated to a speci fi c facility, for example, where there \nis the specialist expertise available to monitor and check for consistency, errors, \ntrends, and quality. \n\n The payload data segment    shall also provide long-term storage of the data pro-\nduced and allow for the proper archiving of the documentation associated with the \nprocessing of data. The algorithm and methods used for calibration    are developed in \nconjunction with the space mission design; nevertheless, they can be improved after \nlaunch, as the behavior of the satellite in orbit becomes better understood. Hence, \nfacilities for the reprocessing of old data with the updated algorithms must also be \nprovided. \n\n The payload data segment   \u2019s last group of functions involves interfacing with con-\nsumers   : the delivery of mission products    and reception of requests. This interfacing \nmay take place in two rather different environments:\n\n   In payload data segments for advancement of science missions    (Section  \u2022  4.5.3    ) that \nentail frequent interacting with a select set of researchers usually called \u201cprincipal \ninvestigators.\u201d Cluster    and Rosetta    are examples of this.  \n  In payload data segments for operational missions   , which require the delivery of \u2022 \ndata to a large and varied community. Sentinel-3    and NOAA-POESS    are examples \nof this.    \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\n\n\n422 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n The \u201castronomical observatory   \u201d missions described in Section   7.2     share both envi-\nronments: they normally feature a restricted core of principal investigators with privi-\nleged access to the mission, and a larger set of general consumers    that must follow \nmore complex procedures to obtain data. The type and form of delivery of mission \nproducts    affects the interface with the consumers. Missions that routinely deliver data \nof a single or few types will require simple interfaces with the consumers. On the \nother hand, missions that have a strong service request character, where different \nusers will have very variable needs requiring the delivery of different products and \nwhere different products can have different time delivery priorities and different \nquantities or throughput, will require the design and implementation of complex \ninterfaces with the consumers. Ful fi lling consumers\u2019 multiple needs requires the \nimplementation of dedicated organizational structures for both the reception of their \nrequests and delivery of the pertinent mission products. In addition, the mission may \nrequire different levels of service quality. One extreme will be operational services \nneeding to ensure high levels of availability   , which will require permanent services \nand guaranteed delivery of data under any circumstances. This requires not only \nadequate interfaces with the consumers receiving these permanent services, but also \nthe use of communication links able to provide absolute reliability as regards avail-\nability. Operational meteorology    or defense-related ventures are examples of mis-\nsions requiring this guarantied availability of services. \n\n As a rule the principal investigators have a high level of knowledge about the mis-\nsion because they would have been deeply involved in its implementation; they are \nproject insiders. As regards general consumers, for either scienti fi c or operational \nundertakings the establishment of networks capable of receiving requests and deliver-\ning products is crucial. The implementation of these functions entails a heavy invest-\nment. The Space Telescope Science Institute of Maryland, described in Section   7.2.1    , \nprovides a clear illustration of the extent of these necessary investments. \n\n It is clear that the de fi nition of the payload data processing is important and that \nadequate effort must be dedicated to an early de fi nition of its functions and architec-\nture. The following decisions must be made:\n\n   Identi fi cation of the fundamental building blocks for the payload data center   , and \u2022 \ndetermining if the existing infrastructure will be adequate for providing the \nrequired services or if new or additional infrastructures are needed.  \n  Where to locate the instrument processing: on the ground or in orbit. This will be \u2022 \ndiscussed in Section  12.4.4 .  \n  Centralized versus decentralized data processing   . This will be discussed in \u2022 \nSection  12.4.6 .  \n  The identi fi cation of any special long-term calibration   , external data validation,    or \u2022 \nreprocessing needs.    \n\n The role of the architect    in the de fi nition of the payload data segment    is strongly \ndependent on the mission constraints. For advancement of science missions    handled \nby authoritative and sophisticated \u201cprincipal investigators,\u201d the latter will assume the \nleading role, with the architect supporting them in the de fi nition of the payload data \nsegment. \n\n In operational systems, responsibility for the de fi nition of the architecture payload \ndata segment    might be in the hands of different organizations. On both sides of the \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\n\n\n423The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\nAtlantic there are space research and operational agencies: NASA and NOAA in the \nUSA and ESA and EUMETSAT in Europe. In cases of collaboration between a \nresearch and an operational agency, the share of responsibility might have been \ndecided before the design process    even started. Nevertheless, the architect   \u2019s view will \nalways be valuable because it provides an end-to-end understanding of the mission. \nThis perspective is essential, since it will ensure a properly designed space mission, \nnot just a properly designed satellite. On the other hand it is the specialist who will \nalways advise the architect on what architecture is possible, as well as on instrument \ndata processing    costs. The cost    aspect is especially important given that the cost esti-\nmation    of the ground data processing shall be based on a functional design   , without \nthe greater certainty offered by a physical design   .   \n\n    12.3.   Examples of architectures \n\n    12.3.1.   Cluster    \n\n Cluster    is a mission led by principal investigators (PI) that have been involved in the \nmission from its origin and who are familiar with the satellite and the instruments   . As \nwith many space science    missions, the downlink    and processing of both operational \nand instrumental data is accomplished in the same data stream to the same ground \nstation, and all the data \u2013 instrument data and satellite status housekeeping data    \u2013 is \nprocessed by the mission operations center   . The specialized function of the mission \noperations center for the processing of mission products    is known as the Central Data \nDisposition System (CDDS) and is located at the Mission Operations    Centre in \nESOC, Germany. There is also a Joint Science Operations Centre, which helps the \nmission operations concentrate on instrument mission planning    and authorizes non-PI \nresearchers to submit requests for obtaining data to the CDDS. All housekeeping \ntelemetry    and other mission data will be made accessible, in addition to the relevant \nscience telemetry and timing information. There are two paths for accessing the pro-\ncessed data:\n\n   Quasi-real-time access via electronic network  \u2022 \n  Off-line access via data media (CD-ROMs)    \u2022 \n\n Quasi-real-time access will be available only to the principal investigators and to \nthe Joint Science Operations Centre. \n\n The CD-ROM\u2019s contain the same data accessible electronically through the \nCDDS, but it is produced and shipped by mail. Scientists interested in doing research \nwith Cluster    but who are not PIs receive a copy of the CD-ROMs mentioned above. \nAn average of two CD-ROMs per day are needed to store all the data produced. 4  The \nvolumes of data for distribution \u2013 around 0.8 Gbit/day \u2013 and they way they are gen-\nerated, stored, and downlinked   , have been already discussed in Section   11.4.1     \n(Figure     12.2 ).   \n\n   4    From P.

Rosetta    \n As in the case of Cluster    there is a single data stream that includes instruments    and \noperational data, which is downlinked    to the ground station and processed together at \nthe same mission operations center   . \n\n Rosetta    mission operations    are divided in two parts:\n\n   Rosetta    mission operations center    (RMOC) for satellite operations     \u2022 \n  Rosetta    science operations center (RSOC) for science operations    \u2022 \n\n The RSOC works in close cooperation with the RMOC and are both located in \nDarmstadt (Germany). \n\n The principal investigators will support RSOC during the critical periods when the \nspacecraft reaches the comet, and RSOC will be the focal point for all inputs gener-\nated by the principal investigators. It is the responsibility of RSOC to coordinate all \ninputs and to propose a strategy for overall payload operations near the comet. With \nthe help of the PIs, the RSOC and the RMOC will establish the operational planning \nand the \u201cnear-real-time\u201d science analysis to cope with the complex and interactive \noperations    required near the comet\u2019s nucleus. The RSOC will also perform the \nscienti fi c data processing distribution and archiving of the data produced by the mis-\nsion. The scienti fi c operations will be performed during the available 9\u201312 h of daily \ncontact between the single ground station in Perth and the satellite. A separate ground \nsegment    will be established for the operations of the Lander Philae   . The Lander PI\u2019s \nwill also generate their operations requests that will be sent to an independent Lander \nScience Center and from there to a Lander Control Center. The consolidated opera-\ntional plan for the Lander will  fi nally be directed to the Rosetta    mission operations \ncenter    for uplink    to the Rosetta satellite, and from there to the Lander Philae when \nneeded. \n\n \n\n\n\n425The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\n The non-PI researchers are federated in Science Working Teams and will produce \nrequests for observations that will be judged by the PIs using previously established \nguidelines (Figure  12.3 ).  \n\n Rosetta    has a storage memory of 23 Gbits that is used as buffer to even out the \ncontinuous data acquisition with the discontinuous periods available for data down-\nlink   . The buffer mass memory also allows for the production of data at fast speeds, \nwhile downlinking    it slowly to Earth   . After proper processing, the data generated by \nthe instrument will be delivered to the PI and to the other scientist through the data \ndisposition system (DDS), which also forms part of the RMOC. The DDS will sup-\nport direct delivery of data through the network and physical delivery of data through \nphysical media (CDs or DVDs).  \n\n    12.3.3.   Sentinel-3    \n\n The relative simplicity of the data distribution approach of the missions described in \nthe two previous sections, whose products are only of interest to a small group of \nscientists contrast to the complexity of Sentinel-3   , which addresses itself to a large \ncommunity of users interested in global ocean and land information.

Figure   11.9    , in the previous chapter \nprovides details of the satellite\u2019s electronics    and also the instruments data  fl ow   . The \ndata produced by the instruments are transmitted by high-speed Spacewire    links and \nstored in the large on-board mass memory located in the Payload Data Handling Unit \n(PDHU). The data is downlinked    by X-band    communications, which uses a low gain, \nwide  fi eld-of-view antenna, which does not need to be pointed to provide adequate \nlink strength.

Sentinel-3\u2019s three instruments con-\ntinuously observe the Earth   , producing 200 Gbits of information per orbit. This large \namount of information can be downlinked at 450 Mbit/s; 8 min of contact is suf fi cient \nfor sending the data generated in one orbit to Earth.  \n\n Sentinel-3   \u2019s main ground station is located in Kiruna, Sweden, but uses Svalbard \nfor contact during the two or three contiguous orbits when there is no contact with \nKiruna. The data received is sent from the ground station to the Payload Data Ground \nSegment (PDGS). The processing of Sentinel-3 is complex and requires the use of \nexternal information. See level anomalies are    used to derive ocean currents, and are \nobserved by Sentinel-3\u2019s radar altimeter   , but this only provides the distance from the \nsatellite to the surface of the ocean; to be able to provide sea surface altitude, the data \nneeds to be corrected by determining with, with high accuracy, the orbit of the satel-\nlite, and this requires precise orbital data from GPS    satellites. This activity is called \n\u201cprecise orbit determination   \u201d (POD of Figure  12.4 ). Sentinel-3\u2019s ground segment    \nalso includes a Flight Operation System (FOS) to handle the operations of the \nSentinel-3 satellites. All the calibrated and corrected data produced by the PDGS are \neventually delivered to some  fi nal users that will prefer to use them directly, and to \nthe \u201cService Segment\u201d that is external to the Sentinel-3 system. This Service Segment \nincludes:\n\n   Ocean and Land Specialized Assembly Centers that will analyze and compare \u2022 \ninformation provided not only by Sentinel-3   , but also by other satellites delivering \nsimilar information. This will permit the derivation of multi-instrument, multimis-\nsion integrated products, and services. This multimission information will further \nimprove the quality of the  fi nal data and of the derived predictions.  \n  Modelers, who will use Sentinel-3    and other data to create ocean, land, and atmo-\u2022 \nspheric models for the elaboration of predictions about the evolution of the atmo-\nsphere, oceans, and vegetation.  \n  The data produced by the Ocean and Land Specialized Centers and by the model-\u2022 \ners will be provided to \u201cvalue adders\u201d that will further process the data including \nlocal information \u2013 like population density or economic value at risk    \u2013 and cus-\ntomize the results according to the needs of the different specialized users.  \n  These \u201cvalue added\u201d products will be  fi nally delivered to end-users that will use \u2022 \nthem as help in decision making.    \n\n All the mission products    shall be distributed in near-real-time in less than 180 min \nfrom acquisition. Sentinel-3   \u2019s orbit has a period of ~90 min and uses a single X-band    \ndownlink    ground contact per orbit; either with Kiruna or with Svalbard ground sta-\ntions   . This single contact allows one downlink to ground per orbit. This approach \nallows a maximum of 90 min from acquisition to downlink and another 90 min for \non-ground data processing and distribution. Actually Sentinel-3\u2019s Payload Ground \nSegment does not provide a single data stream but three (Figure  12.4 ):\n\n   The above-mentioned Near-Real-Time (NRT) data stream, which has to be deliv-\u2022 \nered with a data latency    shorter than 180 min.  \n  Slow Time Critical (STC) data that has to be provided in less than 24 h and that is \u2022 \nused mainly for oceanographic operational monitoring. The supplementary time \n\n\n\n428 Introduction to Space Systems\n\npermits improved corrections to be made \u2013 mainly improved precision orbit deter-\nmination    \u2013 and better products accuracy.  \n  Non Time Critical (NTC) data that includes the most accurate correction methods \u2022 \nand that is used for long-term monitoring of the sea level and for global change \napplication.    \n\n Sentinel-3    is also capable of providing real-time data to its X-band    Partner\u2019s \nGround Stations. The downlink    data rate is the same as that used for the main stations \nKiruna or Svalbard, but this service can only be provided a few times per orbit.  \n\n    12.3.4.   NOAA \u2013 POESS    \n\n    12.3.4.1.   Mission aim \n The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS   ) is \nthe backbone for the operational provision of meteorological and environmental data. 5  \nThis program is a fusion of the civilian POES program of NOAA and of the military \nDMS program of the American Department of Defense (DoD). It was established in \n1994 as a common endeavor of NOAA, NASA, and the DoD. NPOESS will be a series \nof satellites and the system will be implemented progressively. The satellites will carry \nmultiple instruments    for the determination of atmospheric and surface data relevant for \noperational meteorology    and environment monitoring   . This is a very large endeavor \nand its instrument compliment has changed, with some instruments being disembarked \nor substituted. In its  fi nal shape NPOESS will  fl y as a constellation of three satellites \nwith instruments providing horizon-to-horizon coverage. Each satellite is able to pro-\nvide whole Earth    coverage in 12 h and the three together are able to provide full Earth \ncoverage every four hours. To do so, the local times    of the ascending nodes    of the three \nsatellites are regularly distributed at 13:30, 17:30, and 21:30 local time   . Figure   9.15     \nprovided the orbital geometry of these three satellites. This will allow a frequent \nupdating of the parameters under observation. All satellites will  fl y in a Sun-\nsynchronous    orbit at 833 km of altitude and with an inclination of 98.7\u00b0. The mass of \neach satellite is variable because they do not carry identical instrument sets but they \nwill be all in the 5,000 kg-plus category. The  fi rst satellite will be launched in 2013. \nThis constellation will be reinforced by the European MetOp    satellite that will  fl y in a \ncomplementary orbital plane    with a LTDN of 09:30 (Figure  12.5 ).  \n\n The design life for the platform is 7 years with 0.9 spacecraft reliability. It can \nprovide up to 7 kW of power and it has a very high stability optical bench to ensure \noptical co-alignment between all the instruments   .  \n\n    12.3.4.2.   Instruments output data  fl ow \n The atmosphere changes rapidly and users of meteorological information vary enor-\nmously. To ful fi ll the need for swift delivery of the different communities of consum-\ners   , the architecture of the NOAA-POESS    data distribution is necessarily complex. It \npossesses four parallel data downlink    systems (see Figure  12.6 ).  \n\n   5    NPOESS    A Program Overview and Status Update, F.

The concept is based on the implementation of 15 \nKa-band    unmanned ground stations    more or less uniformly distributed around the \nglobe and providing an average of  fi ve contacts per orbit between ground station and \nsatellite. When a satellite enters a SafetyNet station visibility circle, all stored data it \nhas recorded is burst to the ground at a speed of 150 Mbit/s. Once all stored data is \ndumped, the satellite downlinks real-time data until it leaves the station visibility \ncircle. For use in the gaps between station circles, NPOESS    has a 300 GBit on-board \nsolid-state recorder. When NPOESS comes within the  fi eld-of-view for the next \nSafetyNet\u2122 station, the process is repeated. These stations are linked by a  fi ber-optic \nsystem to the central data processing centers    where the modeling of global weather \npatterns is undertaken with the aim of providing whole Earth    meteorological \npredictions. \n\n The second system is an X-band    downlink    at 400 Mbit/s, downlinking    once per \norbit to a large, 13 m diameter antenna in Svalbard, in the Arctic. This download \narchitecture is similar to Sentinel-3   \u2019s: one contact per orbit that is downlinked    at a \nspeed rapid enough to empty the stored data produced during the last orbit. \n\n To cope with the needs of consumers    interested in regional meteorological predic-\ntions, the Direct Readout Mission 7  (DRM) broadcasts, that is, continuously down-\nlinks data as the instruments    produce them. DRM will service users in the  fi eld \nproviding regional environmental coverage with two direct broadcast links:\n\n   High rate data (HRD) in X-band    at 20 Mbit/s compatible with a 2 m \u00d8 antenna  \u2022 \n  Low rate data (LRD) in L-band    at 3.88 Mbit/s with a 1 m \u00d8 antenna    \u2022 \n\n The signal sent by the satellites to the  fi eld terminal is ampli fi ed, down converted, \ndemodulated, decoded, and decrypted. Later it is processed and the environmental \ndata records are generated. Ancillary data needed for the production of the data \nrecords, such as satellite position or attitude, is included in the same downlink   . HRD \nand LRD ground stations    are provided with their own data processing algorithms \nable to produce a large number of data products. The resulting data records can be \nproduced at high speed, in 2\u201315 min, by computers of moderate performance. The \nsmall size of the requisite antennae, the availability of data processing software,    and \nthe modest processing power required guarantees that consumers    interested in local \nmeteorological information can acquire HRD or LRD components easily. Consumers \nwith more demanding requirements    will need to employ HRD, while consumers \nwith less demanding requirements can acquire the much simpler and cheaper LRD. \nThese two systems provide a fully integrated and easily acquired solution. This \nensures maximum operational use of NOAA-POESS   , optimizing the social bene fi ts \nproduced by the mission. This approach continues the legacy of previous NOAA \noperational meteorology    missions, which also provided direct broadcast of mission \nproducts    by the HRPT and LRPT subsystems. In HRD, 50 mission products (envi-\nronmental data records) can be downlinked   , while in LRD the limit is 29 with data \ncompression   .    \n\n   7    NPOESS    Direct Readout Mission, John A. van de Wouwa et al., Atmospheric and Environmental Remote \nSensing Data Processing and Utilization, SPIE Vol. 5890, 2005.  \n\n\n\n431The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\n    12.4.   Allocation of functions \n\n    12.4.1.   Large versus small amount of data \n\n Instruments data output quantity has been already discussed in Section   8.4.4    , which \nanalyzed the factors driving the data rate. Depending on the nature of the observables   , \nthe data rates could vary widely: Cluster    obtains data in situ, over a single point, and \nits data rate is just of 0.8 Gbits per day; Sentinel-3    produces 3,000 Gbits per day. High \nspatial resolution   , large-swath instruments    can produce several hundreds of Mbit/s. \nSpectrometers with very  fi ne spectral resolution    also have very high data throughputs. \nSynthetic Aperture Radars    are notorious for the amount of data they produce. The \ntransmission to Earth    of such a quantity of data is dif fi cult and the downlink    capacity \nof the satellite can turn into a bottleneck for the whole mission. Providing high data \n fl ow requires:\n\n   High-power data emitters in the satellite  \u2022 \n  High-gain antennae in the satellite  \u2022 \n  Higher downlink    frequencies able to code more information on the available \u2022 \nbandwidth     \n  High-power and high-gain antennae on the ground  \u2022 \n  The use of data compression    techniques  \u2022 \n  The provision of long contact times by providing data relay satellites    or using \u2022 \nhigher orbits  \n  The provision of long contact times by provision of a large number of ground \u2022 \nstations     \n  The provision of long contact times by a judiciously locating ground stations    in \u2022 \nplaces with optimal satellite visibility    \n\n All the aforementioned tools have limitations: high-gain antennae are large in size; \ndata compression    techniques might be unacceptable for some applications; data relay \nsatellites    may be unavailable and are expensive, as is the use of numerous ground \nstations   . The downlink    speed is limited; once the downlink frequency is chosen, the \nmaximum speed of the downlink is rigidly determined by the existing allowable \nbandwidth    standards (introduced in Table   11.1     of the previous chapter). This implies \nthat there are often absolute limitations in the data rate, forcing a reduction of con-\nsumer    expectations. During Rosetta   \u2019s rendezvous    with the comet, scientist\u2019s employ-\ning the satellite would have welcomed larger data rates than the meager 5 kbit/s \nmentioned in Section   11.4.2    ; nevertheless, the large distance between Earth    and the \ncomet at the time of the observation imposed the limitation. Also due to satellite data \nthroughput    limitations, high-resolution Earth observation    payloads can often only \nacquire images during a brief period of the satellite\u2019s complete orbital time. The rest \nof this chapter will focus on the advantages and disadvantages of increasing data \nthroughputs of missions by various means. \n\n Sentinel-3    provides regular and consistent information over the whole of the \nEarth   . That means the instruments    are continuously acquiring information. The only \nexception to this constant 100% duty cycle is the obvious one of visual imagers    not \nbeing able to acquire information at night. Being global, the optical instruments have \na high swath width and provide information in many bands. The radar altimeter also \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n432 Introduction to Space Systems\n\npossesses a high data rate synthetic aperture mode that produces large amounts of \ndata, as well as a conventional low data throughput    mode. The tools used to moderate \nthe data rate are the instrument\u2019s resolution and the percentage of time that the syn-\nthetic aperture mode of the radar altimeter is allowed to be operational. The instru-\nment\u2019s resolution is limited to 250 m, which ful fi lls the expressed needs of the \nconsumers   ; nevertheless, if higher spatial resolutions had been possible, the consum-\ners would have chosen them. In the case of the radar altimeter modes, a somewhat \narti fi cial half-and-half division between the high and low data throughput modes has \nbeen adopted. This allows for observations in the better resolution synthetic aperture \nmode during half of the time. This is suf fi cient for characterizing all the coastal zones, \nice-covered areas, and inland waters. The chosen solution provides a data  fl ow archi-\ntecture compatible with proven techniques for downlinking    and with just one station \ncontact per orbit. Here we see a clear example of the interests of the consumer    being \nmodulated by the need for an affordable system. \n\n Cluster    studies the magnetosphere    by measuring the electric and magnetic  fi elds \nof the area it is  fl ying through, by means of in situ    instruments   . At each instant in time \nthe area of observation is a single point. This brings the data throughput    to 20\u2013130 \nkbit/s. The daily average is just 0.8 Gbit. Due to the orbital geometry, the average \ncontact times with the ground are lengthy, and they must be shared between the four \nsatellites of the constellation. The 5 Gbit on-board memory acts as a buffer for the \ndata produced by the instruments, and can store up to six orbits of data. The modest \ndata rates ensure that the mission can be built with comfortable margins, using low \nrisk    technology, and requiring just one ground station to serve the mission. \n\n The long distance between Earth    and the comet at the crucial scienti fi c periods is \nthe dominant constraint    on Rosetta   \u2019s instrument data  fl ow. This distance oscillates \nbetween 4 and 6 AU (Figure   11.7    ). Rosetta carries a set of varied instruments   , includ-\ning in situ    and imaging instruments. The ground station for data delivery is the 35 m \ndiameter ESA ground station in Perth, Australia. The orbital geometry provides a \nsingle contact per day with a contact length of about 12 h. Rosetta carries a large \nhigh-gain antenna that dominates the con fi guration    of the satellite. The data through-\nput    is determined by the 12-h daily contact and the 5 kbit/s of data rate. The mass \nmemory can store 25 Gbits of data and allows the observation of complex events that \ncan be stored and downlinked    slowly to Earth. Both the emitting and ground-receiv-\ning antennae are the largest and most powerful currently compatible with affordable \ntechnology. The NASA DSN network has 70 m diameter antennae, while those of the \nESA equivalent stations are just 35 m in diameter. \n\n NOAA-POESS    produces 20 Mbit/s of data, the equivalent of 110 Gbits per orbit. \nAs with Sentinel-3   , the operational meteorological data that this mission produces is \nacquired continuously, except that visual optical data is not gathered at night. The \ninstrument complement of NOAA-POESS is quite varied, and gathers highly accu-\nrate data over many bands as well as having wide swaths. Nevertheless, the spatial \nresolution    of the instruments    is moderate and the resulting data rates, while large, are \ncompatible with existing technology. The use of an average of  fi ve contacts per orbit, \nprovided by the 15 SafetyNet    ground stations    (which allow a high speed data down-\nlink    of 150 Mbit/s) provides a scenario in which the handling of the instrumental data \nquantity is not critical. NOAA-POESS\u2019s criticality is within the limits of data deliv-\nery speed that will be discussed later.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n433The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\n    12.4.2.   Short versus long data latency    \n\n This section continues the discussion of fast-versus-slow data request and delivery \nstarted in Section   8.4.6     and continued in Section   11.5.3     of the previous chapter. The \ndiscussion in Section   11.5.3     focused on the \u201ctime to acquire\u201d part of the end-to-end \ntimeline. The discussion here will focus on the \u201ctime to deliver\u201d and on the resulting \n\u201cdata latency   \u201d that was de fi ned in Section   8.4.6     as the time elapsed between the \nacquisition of data by the instruments    and the delivery to the  fi nal user of the products \nbased on these data. Data latency    includes the time necessary for the satellite to be \nable to downlink    information plus the time necessary to process and to deliver the \ndata. Figures  12.7  and  12.8  provide consumer   -centered perspective of the same end-\nto-end timeline already depicted in Figure   8.18    .   \n\n The speci fi ed latency    will be more demanding for missions that study fast-chang-\ning phenomena, and less demanding for those studying more slowly changing ones. \nThe delivery of mission products    with data that are as recent as possible is of extreme \nimportance for operational missions    because the information is used to make deci-\nsions that could be detrimental if the data used to derive the decisions were too old. \nThe latency period will be especially critical for missions that require fast decision \nmaking, as in cases of military and civilian security. Science missions also prefer    fast \ndelivery of data, as it allows a far more interactive study of the phenomena under \nobservation; this is especially so for analyzing the observations of transient events \nsuch as frequently occurs in X-ray astronomy. In the other hand, missions that are \npushing the state of the knowledge will deal with production of data that requires \ndeliberate processing and a long time for correct understanding. This type of missions \nwill not put a heavy emphasis in short latencies. Cluster    provides reasonably fast \ndelivery of data to the principal investigator and lower delivery to the secondary \nconsumer   . This is an example of a science mission with rather relaxed overall data \nlatency    requirements   . \n\n Rosetta    would have bene fi ted from fast timelines in order to allow for the \nadaptation of observational strategies to the phenomena being detected by the \nsatellite. However, Rosetta is limited by the long delays required for the signal to \ntravel to and from the Earth   , and by the slow data uplink    and downlink    speeds. \nThis forces long waiting times for the delivery to ground of the acquired data, \nwhich are stored in the satellite\u2019s 25 Gbit solid-state mass memory until they can \nbe sent to Earth. \n\n Sentinel-3    and NOAA-POESS    have similar architectures and requirements    \nbecause both produce global data to be assimilated into large computer models, but \n\nOrbit Downlink Basic Processing Value Adding Processing Delivery\n\nTimeline to deliver \n\nLatency \n\n  Figure 12.7.

The need to monitor \nphenomena such as hurricanes, tornadoes, or Mediterranean autumn  fl ash  fl oods \nrequires the rapid and increasingly accurate knowledge of the current weather and the \nreduction of data latency. The fast-changing nature of meteorology explains the \nsophistication \u2013 and associated cost    \u2013 of the NOAA-POESS data downlink    architec-\nture that allows the reduction of data latency    from 3 h to 30 min. \n\n SSTL-DMC   , discussed in Section   11.4.4     above, possessed an instrument data \nprocessing    system capable of providing the mission products    in a period between 4 h \nto 2 days, depending of the level of processing and quality of the data products. \n\n The steps necessary to deliver the acquired data are the following:\n\n    1.    The satellite needs time to reach a point in the orbit which offers a data downlink    \nopportunity either through contact with a ground station or, in the rare cases where \nthey are available, with a data relay satellite   . This period is dependent on the orbit, \nthe number of downlink ground stations,    and the use or not of data relay \nsatellites   .  \n\n    2.    Once the data has arrived on Earth    it must undergo a  fi rst processing step that nor-\nmally involves the delivery of calibrated and well-referenced data, with respect to \nthe Earth or sky; for example, if the instrument is a radiometer, the processed data \nwill be calibrated radiometric  fl uxes entering the instrument arriving from clearly \n\n  Figure 12.8.    Step-by-Step Image Acquisition and Delivery Process. It Includes the Steps \nRelated to the Uplink   /Operational Timeline and to the Downlink   /Instrument \nTimeline.       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n435The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\nidenti fi ed locations. This data will still be more related to the physics of the instru-\nment than to the physics of the phenomena under observation. Sophisticated users \nfamiliar with the instrument will know how to take full advantage of this data.  \n\n    3.    High-level processing will convert the data to physical parameters directly related \nto the phenomena under observation, for example, the radiometric  fl uxes could be \ntransformed into temperatures of the terrestrial surfaces under observation. All \npotential consumers   , including those not familiar with the instruments   , will be able \nto use this data. Its reception requires further processing and supplementary \ndelay.  \n\n    4.    Finally, high- and low-level processed data can be delivered to the consumers   . \nThis can be done through the physical delivery (i.e., by post) of media such as CDs \nor DVDs, or via the Internet by ftp or http. For users requiring systematic and large \ndatasets, dissemination through communication satellites    using small antennae, \n1\u20132 m in diameter, is another, and affordable, possibility.     \n\n The delay for steps 2 and 3 can be reduced by the use of sophisticated algorithms \nand powerful computers, step 4 can easily use the possibilities provided by the \nInternet and by the newer broadband communications systems, but step 1 can only be \nreduced by providing a large number of ground stations   , as done by NOAA-POESS    \nor by providing the use of data relay satellites   , as done by ESA with Envisat and \nArtemis   . Both alternatives are complex and expensive. \n\n The use of data relay satellites    located in the geostationary position increases the \ndata throughput    because it ampli fi es the allowable contact time from the 10 min per \ncontact per ground station to 30-40 min per orbit and per data relay satellite   . Data \nrelay satellites provide clear advantages for heavy data producers. The NASA NOAA \nLandsat    has used and continues using the operational TDRSS    constellation of data \nrelay satellites. The constellation of NASA Earth    science satellites (Terra, Aqua, and \nAura), also use TDRSS. ESA and CNES have also used the demonstration data relay \nsatellite Artemis   : CNES to downlink    Spot    V data through an optical data relay link \nand ESA to downlink Envisat (Figure  12.9 ) data through a Ka-band    microwave link. \nThe use of Artemis has allowed more extensive employment of the instruments    by \nEnvisat and Spot. The distance from low Earth orbit    to the geostationary position is \nlarge, and a data relay link will require pointable high-gain antennae in both the low \norbit and geostationary satellites. Data relay satellites are an infrastructure that ser-\nvice many users, hence will inevitably be shared with other satellites.   \n\n    12.4.3.   Existing, to-be-acquired and subscribed products \n\n Four types of consumer    request situations are possible:\n\n    1.    The request is for a not-yet-performed observation that shall be acquired, returned \nto ground, processed, and delivered.  \n\n    2.    The request is a subscription for regular and systematic delivery of a certain type of \nproduct, for example, all the observations over a speci fi c area of the Earth    or sky.  \n\n    3.    Requests are unnecessary. The data processed by the instruments    are broadcast and \ncan be received by anyone after some type of registering process and with the use \nof adequate equipment.  \n\n    4.    The request is for already acquired observations stored in the mission\u2019s archive.     \n\n\n\n436 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n Each of these delivery modes has implications for different aspects of the end-to-end \nspace system. \n\n Type 1 is the broadest, it has implications affecting every element of the space \nsystem, and was analyzed in Sections   8.4.6     and   11.5.3    . Figure  12.8  depicts the pro-\ncess from the point of view of the consumer    and Figure   8.17     from the point of view \nof the satellite. This is the commonest type of situation in advancement of science \nmissions   . The astronomical observatory    missions    described in Section   7.2     are all of \nthis type. High-resolution Earth    observation    missions, like SSTL-DMC   , described in \nSection   11.4.4    , and Pleiades    described in Section   9.6.4     are also of this type. These \nmissions study a small area within a large area in great detail. This is the reason it is \nnecessary to command the satellite to point in a special direction. In these missions \ninstrument operations are interactive    (Section   8.4.5    ). \n\n Type 2 is simpler; it requires no continuously changing mission planning   , but \nimpacts all the other parts of the end-to-end system, from in-orbit instrument data \nproduction to data distribution to consumers   . This situation occurs in Earth    or sky \nsurvey missions such as that of Sentinel-3   , discussed in Sections   11.4.3     and  12.3.3 . \nOperational Meteorological missions like NOAA POESS   , described in Section  12.3.4 , \nare also of this type. An extreme case is provided by global meteorological assimila-\ntion centers that provide whole Earth meteorological predictions. These centers \nrequire the regular and timely delivery of all the data produced by one or several \nspace missions. The architecture capable of providing this type of service does not \nrequire a high degree of  fl exibility but must be optimal to ensure timely and reliable \ndelivery of data to the assimilation centers producing the global meteorological pre-\ndictions. These missions provide synoptic    regular views of large areas. In these mis-\nsions, instrument operations are systematic    (Section   8.4.5    ). \n\n  Figure 12.9.    Use of Artemis    Data Relay Satellite    in Envisat Data Downlink    (Image Courtesy \nESA).       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n437The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\n Type 3 situations are best suited to ensuring the widest use of the data produced \nby the satellite. The two NOAA-POESS    DRM systems, described in Figure  12.6  of \nSection  12.3.4 , which broadcasts information to regional users, are good examples. \nIn order to provide higher-level, superior quality mission products   , this kind of data \ndistribution also requires the provision of algorithms to the consumers   , permitting \nthem additional ground processing of the broadcast data. NOAA-POESS, for \ninstance, provides this type of algorithm delivery and maintenance service. \n\n Type 4 requests are easy to satisfy because the delivery to consumers    of already \nexisting data only affects the payload data segment. This delivery mode is common \nin studies of slow changing physical phenomena, like climate change. Providing this \ntype of services entails the long-term maintenance of consistent quality data and the \ndocumentation relative to the algorithms used for data calibration    throughout the \nduration of the mission. It should be noted that this long-term maintenance of consis-\ntent data can be expensive.  \n\n    12.4.4.   In-orbit versus on-ground processing \n\n It is clear from the previous sections that the amount of data to be downlinked    by the \nsatellite can pose problems and that when in-orbit processing is used to reduce it, the \nmission\u2019s design will be simpli fi ed. Synthetic aperture radars and interferometers \nproduce enormous amounts of data that can be reduced by on-board processing   . The \namount of data produced by high-resolution high-swath imaging instruments    can also \nbe reduced by data compression   . There are four possible scenarios:\n\n   Complex data processing that can signi fi cantly reduce data throughput   . This is the \u2022 \ncase for on-board SAR    or on-board Fourier transform spectroscopic processing.  \n  Complex data processing that destroys data recognized on-board as irrelevant. \u2022 \nOne example is the nondownlink    of images covered by clouds.  \n  Data compression that preserves information and only moderately reduces the data \u2022 \nthroughput   . This is the case of lossless compression of images.  \n  Data compression that destroys information and that signi fi cantly reduces data \u2022 \nthroughput   . This is the case of lossy compression of images.    \n\n On-board computers are progressively more powerful and synthetic aperture and \nspectroscopic processing is progressively becoming within the capabilities of existing \nsystems and, the near future will see increased possibilities for this type of on-board \nprocessing   . \n\n Also are rare space missions that allow satellites to autonomously decide whether \nthe data produced by the instruments    is irrelevant and could be deleted. To unequivo-\ncally decide that clouds cover part of an image is more dif fi cult than it looks. Despite \na great deal of research, as yet there are no algorithms capable of ful fi lling this func-\ntion with no mistakes being made, but as is the case of interferometric and spectro-\nscopic on-board processing   , this is another area where future improvements will \nallow for this type of data elimination. A second problem associated to this approach \nis that the downlink    of variable amounts of information will require variable data \nrates and that the downlink system shall be anyway dimensioned for maximum data \n\n\n\n438 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nthroughput   . That means, this approach rather complicate than simplify the data \ndownlink. \n\n The use in satellites of data compression   , both lossy and lossless, is extensive and \nsimple to implement. It is used in all missions that produce large data throughput   . In \nthe case of lossless compression, the reduction of data throughput is modest: a guar-\nanteed minimum compression factor of 1.8. This minimum value applies to data \ncontaining a lot of phase information, for example, that produced by spectroscopes or \nsynthetic aperture radars. Algorithms able to signi fi cantly reduce data throughput \nwith only moderate reduction of image quality are used for high-resolution optical \ninformation. The Pleiades    lossy data compression algorithm allows data to be reduced \nby an average minimum factor of four, and QuickBird by a minimum factor of 5. 8  \nDespite the advantages that extensive use of on-board data compression provides for \nmission performance, it must be used with extreme caution. In general, advancement \nof science missions    opt to avoid data compression, while operational missions    toler-\nate it far better. The deletion of information, even of apparently small amounts of it, \nis dangerous in science missions where the actual value of the information being \ndestroyed is unknown. On the other hand, operational missions bene fi t far more from \naggressive data compression approaches. Consumers    have the  fi nal say on whether to \nallow on board data processing, with the risk    that valuable information might be \ndestroyed, or whether they prefer to reduce the mission\u2019s output in order to accom-\nmodate a lower data throughput, for example, by allowing coarser spatial or spectral \nresolution   , or a smaller swath.  \n\n    12.4.5.   Number and location of ground stations \n\n The ground stations    considered in this section do not send commands to the satellite; \nthey only receive data from the satellite. Therefore, there is a much higher level of \nfreedom in the selection of their location. It is very common to subcontract data \nreception to ground stations that are not under the direct control of the authority that \nowns the in-orbit satellite. This gives the architect    freedom to choose the location of \nthe stations that are the best placed to provide a service to the satellite. \n\n The number and location of ground stations    must be optimized to allow downlink-\ning    of all the data produced in the satellite at the speed allowed by the chosen design. \nThe number and use of ground stations will depend on the frequency and time periods \nthat ground stations are within range of the satellite and can establish a link with it. \n\n There are three possible scenarios:\n\n   The satellite is not orbiting Earth   . The contact pattern is governed by the Earth\u2019s \u2022 \nrotation   .  \n  The satellite is orbiting Earth    but its period is long, comparable with Earth\u2019s rota-\u2022 \ntion   . The orbital period    and Earth rotation combined govern the contact pattern.  \n  The satellite is orbiting the Earth    at low altitude and with a short orbital period   . \u2022 \nThe contact pattern is governed by the orbital period and inclination.    \n\n We will now analyze these three scenarios in depth. \n\n   8   Observation of the Earth    and Its Environment, H.Kramer, Springer 2002.   \n\n\n\n439The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\n    12.4.5.1.   Satellites not orbiting the Earth    \n Satellites located far from Earth   , such as Rosetta   , appear as  fi xed over the celestial \nsphere    and the visibility pattern is governed by the Earth\u2019s rotation   . Earth\u2019s rotation \nallows ground stations    to scan the heavens; the satellite becomes visible when located \nabove the ground station\u2019s celestial horizon. One ground station provides visibility \nduring a single period of approximately 10 h per day, while three uniformly distrib-\nuted ground stations can provide permanent contact. That is why NASA\u2019s Deep \nSpace Network has stations in California, Australia, and Spain. ESA is implementing \na similar network of stations located in the same countries. The stations located in \nSpain and Australia are now operational and the third one is under construction. \n\n The use of these systems is expensive and the few stations able to provide com-\nmunications to far-away planets    must be shared by all the existing space missions \nrequiring them. In order to reduce costs, satellites are designed to minimize the need \nfor ground contact. A single ground station (in this case located in Australia) serves \nRosetta   . As described in Section   7.2    , the three ground stations    of NASA\u2019s DSN \nwould be capable of continuously serving JWST   ; but JWST\u2019s data  fl ow architecture \nwas designed to require just a single contact of 4 h per day. This is a further demon-\nstration of the progressive tendency to satellite autonomy   , permitted by the improved \ncapabilities of computers and the need to reduce costs.  \n\n    12.4.5.2.   Long period satellite orbiting the Earth    \n Satellites with periods similar or equal to Earth\u2019s rotation    will have long periods of \ncontact followed by periods of noncontact (longer or shorter depending on the orbit) \nwith their ground station. An extreme example is a geostationary satellite with a \nperiod of 24 h, which allows permanent contact between the satellite and a well-\nlocated ground station. IUE    was launched in 1978, and as discussed in Section   7.2     \nhad an orbit of 32,050 km of perigee    and 52,254 km of apogee   , with an orbital period    \nof 24 h. It used two ground stations   , one near Washington DC and the other near \nMadrid. The plane and eccentricity    of the satellite\u2019s orbit were such that the European \nstation had visibility for 8 h a day and the American one 16 h a day. \n\n Cluster    (Section   11.4.1    ) has an orbital period    of 57 h, equivalent to 2 days and \n9 h; its orbital inclination is 90\u00b0, the apogee    altitude is 119,000 km and the perigee    \naltitude is 19,000 km. The pattern of one Earth    orbit and the visibility from the \nMadrid ground station can be seen in Figure  12.10 . The orbital period is long with \nrespect to the 24-h rotation of the Earth, and when the satellites are near the apo-\ngee they are nearly  fi xed in the sky and Earth\u2019s rotation    dominates visibility. This \nprovides in every orbit a  fi rst long contact period of 11:23 h and a second one of \n10:25 h. All together, Cluster satellites are visible approximately 38% of the total \norbital time.  \n\n As we have seen with the two examples provided, satellites orbiting the Earth    with \nlong orbital periods permit long periods of contact with a single, wisely chosen \nground station. The percentage of time with full ground contact will oscillate from 30 \n% to 100 % in the case of geostationary orbits   . \n\n This visibility pattern allows the design of a communications architecture in which \none ground station allows a high percentage of contact time as well as the downlink-\ning    of large amounts of data at moderate speeds. This geometry can also produce long \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n440 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nperiods without ground contact. The length of this blind time can be reduced by judi-\ncious choosing of the orbit inclination, the eccentricity,    and the location of the ground \nstation. The satellite will require on-board memory for the storage of data acquired \nby the instruments    while the satellite is out of range with its ground station.  \n\n    12.4.5.3.   Short period satellites orbiting the Earth    with high inclination \n This is the traditional orbit for Earth observation    and delivers observation coverage \nof the entire Earth from pole to pole. Satellites in this orbit pass over both poles on \neach orbit, and ground stations    near the poles ensure contact on every orbit. \nFigure  12.11  provides the visibility of a typical Earth observation satellite contacting \nthe Svalbard ground station on each orbit. This ground station provides contact \nlengths varying from 6 to 12 min. The station allows downlinking    of data 2:38 h per \nday, equivalent to 11 % of the total time.  \n\n This alternative of a single ground station and one contact per orbit provides a \nreasonable data  fl ow architecture implementation that is satisfactory for many types \nof missions. Considering that the typical orbital period    for a low altitude orbit Earth-\nobserving satellite is about 90 min, if one downlink    per orbit is foreseen, then at the \nmoment of the downlink the oldest data transmitted will be one and a half hours old. \nWith another 90 min allowed for data processing, calibration    and quality checking, \nthe information delivered to the customer    will be less than 3 h old. The consequences \nof missing a contact with such a ground station, for example, due to a maintenance \nissue on-ground can result in permanently lost data \n\n However, there are many situations where this 3 h delay will be insuf fi cient. For \nsituations requiring faster data processing it is necessary to provide a more ef fi cient \nand complex data  fl ow architecture. One possibility is to provide stations not only \nnear the North Pole but near the South Pole as well. Due to the harsh climate, the use \nof stations and their associated infrastructure at the poles requires heavy investment. \n\n This visibility pattern allows the design of a communications architecture in which \none ground station allows a high percentage of contact time as well as the downlink-\ning    of large amounts of data.  \n\n  Figure 12.10.   One Cluster    Orbit Visibility from Madrid ( green ).       \n\n \n\n\n\n441The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\n    12.4.5.4.   Short period satellites orbiting the Earth    with low inclination \n The most ef fi cient way to put satellites into orbit is to place them in low-inclination \nlow-altitude orbits    around the Earth   , and most satellites not requiring a speci fi c orbit \nend up in low inclination orbits around the Earth. The most ef fi cient way to commu-\nnicate with a satellite in a low Earth orbit    is to locate a ground station with latitude \nsimilar to the inclination of the satellite\u2019s orbit. Figure  12.12  provides the contact \npattern for an orbit with an inclination of 40\u00b0, using a ground station near Madrid.  \n\n In the most likely case that this type of orbit was chosen for satellites with less \ndemanding requirements   , one single ground station is normally able to provide ade-\nquate ground contract. Madrid can provide 1:17 h of contact per day distributed in six \nor seven contacts of around 11 min each. In cases that it will be necessary to provide \nlonger contact time, more stations \u2013 always located within the area over fl own by the \nsatellite \u2013 will be necessary.   \n\n    12.4.6.   Centralized versus decentralized processing \n\n Processing of the data produced by the instrument is crucial. This processing requires \nthe use not only of the instrument output but also of supplementary data provided by \nthe satellite, and frequently of external data used as a reference. Processing will pro-\nduce data of increasing levels of sophistication and value. This progressive process-\ning can be performed at a single site used for distributing mission products    to the \nconsumers   , or alternatively, different consumers can independently perform their own \nprocessing. NOAA POESS    provides examples for both cases. \n\n SafetyNet    and the centralized X-band    downlink    provide data to a select group of \ndata assimilation modelers that will use them to produce global operational meteoro-\nlogical predictions. This centralized approach works well because centralized global \nmeteorological predictions can use the most sophisticated data and the most powerful \ncomputers while providing information valid for the whole Earth   . On the other hand, \n\n  Figure 12.11.   ERS 1 Day Orbit and Visibility from Svalbard ( green ).       \n\n \n\n\n\n442 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nNOAA-POESS    DRS system produces data broadcast directly from the satellite to \nnumerous regional users. These regional users will perform their own processing. \nThis ensures the widest and fastest use of the information produced by the satellite. \nThe existence of these two totally independent systems for data downlinking    and \nprocessing is made necessary by the different needs of different consumers   . Some \nwill prefer the quality and global scope of centralized data processing   ; others will \nprefer the speed and independence of the decentralized data processing   . Sentinel-3    \nhas a more centralized data downlink and processing architecture. The central PDGS \nprocesses the data and provides it to the modelers and assembly centers that also use \ndata produced by other satellites and by in situ    instruments   . All the data assimilated \ntogether provides predictions on ocean status that are delivered to the users. \n\n Cluster    and Rosetta    provide mixed scenarios. The data processing is performed by \na selected group of principal investigators, but the data can be distributed to external \nresearchers who prefer to do their own processing. \n\n Centralized data processing centers    allow a tight control of the production and \ndissemination of the information produced by the satellites. An additional bene fi t of \ncentralized data processing is that it allows the long-term storage of well-documented \ndata. This rigorous data archiving is crucial to many scienti fi c applications.  \n\n    12.4.7.   Science operations separated or as part of overall operations \n\n The satellite\u2019s operations have as an important subset the operations of the instruments   . \nThe mission control    center, which prepares and uplinks the commands to the satellite, \nmust take into account the consumers   \u2019 data acquisition requests. These requests are \n fi ltered and processed by the science operation center, which considers them according \nto their scienti fi c merit, scienti fi c mission adequacy, and mutual compatibility. The \nresulting requests must then be  fi ltered from the perspective of view of their technical \nadequacy: to what extent are the request compatible with the availability    of satellite \n\n90.0\nLA\n\nT\nIT\n\nU\nD\n\nE\n (\n\nD\nE\n\nG\n)\n\n60.0\n\n30.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u201330.0\n\n\u201360.0\n\n\u201390.0\n\n\u2013180.0\n\nLOWING (2000-01-01 00:00: 0.)

Hence, the establishment of the \nobservation plan    has dual components: technical and scienti fi c. \n\n In the case of the Hubble    Space Telescope (Section   7.2    ) we discussed the functions \nperformed by Goddard , which performs the technical role, and the Space Telescope \nScience Institute, which performs the scienti fi c role. The description of Rosetta   \u2019s \nscienti fi c operations in Section  12.3.2  also offers a good example of the collaboration \nof satellite (RMOC) and instrument (RSOC) specialists together establishing obser-\nvation plans   .   \n\n    12.5.   Allocation of performances \n\n    12.5.1.   On-board storage memory budget \n\n The instruments    produce data at varying speeds depending on their operating modes. \nThe instrument downlinks the data produced when visibility with the ground stations    \npermits, or when permitted by the link with the data relay satellite   . An on-board mass \nmemory is essential for providing a buffer storage between data production and data \ndownlink   . All the missions studied in this chapter employ mass storages of differing \nsizes: Cluster    uses 5 Gbit; Rosetta    25 Gbit; Sentinel-3    uses 200 Gbit; and NOAA-\nPOESS    300 Gbit. The amount of memory must be high enough to allow the buffer \nstorage of all the data produced by the instrument with the largest data production, \ncombined realistically with the amount produced during the longest period without \ndownlinking    opportunities. The time allowable for actual data downlinking is generally \nsmall with respect to the overall mission time; consequently, the downlink speed must \nbe higher than the data production speed. In the case of NOAA-POESS, data is pro-\nduced at 20 Mbit/s and the maximum downlink speed is 400 Mbit/s. The on-board \naccommodation of the required mass memory size is normally not a problem. The lon-\ngest period without ground contact is the crucial determining factor and is a function of \nthe orbit and the downlink geometry, but the data production rates of the instruments \ncannot be predicted with a high degree of accuracy during the earliest stages of design. \nIn line with the general tendency to use high safety margins    in the early dimensioning \nof digital hardware, safety factors of 1.5 to 2 are used in the early estimations of mass \nmemory    size. Is it worth stating that early in the design stage an average system data \ncirculation analysis is produced, but this early analysis can be inaccurate, and pending \nthe determination of the platform and payload data production rates, orbit, ground sta-\ntions number, and locations it is all that can be done. However, a more accurate dynamic \ndata circulation analysis must soon follow as data became more de fi ned. It is necessary \nto avoid situations where the mass memory or the downlink rates could exceed the \noriginally allocated values. This will require the use of safety margins.  \n\n    12.5.2.   Data downlink budget \n\n The link budgets    and its associated problems were discussed at length in Section \n  11.6.2     of the previous chapter, that section studied with detail the problems associated \nto the downlink    of information from satellites located far away from the Earth. The \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n444 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nproblems depicted there must also be considered here, but this section will provide \nsupplementary material applicable to cases featuring large volumes of instrument \ndata, an issue particularly associated with the downlinking    of instrumental output \nfrom near-Earth orbits, and not properly covered in Section   11.6.2    . \n\n In near-Earth    orbits, the distance from satellite to ground station is small, and theo-\nretically, it should be possible, using reasonable communication components, to \ndownlink    at enormous data rates. Nonetheless, to avoid interference between distinct \nusers, and as explained in Section   11.1.3    , the international Telecommunication Union \n(ITU   ) regulates the communications environment. These regulations introduce two \nsupplementary constraints on designers:\n\n   The signal\u2019s maximum allowable power  fl ux density    is limited. Mission designers \u2022 \ncannot increase the signal power arriving at the ground station beyond the regu-\nlated limit. Because it is a power  fl ux density limitation, it restricts antenna gain    \nas well as the total power radiated by the satellite.  \n  The spectrum bandwidth    itself is limited, as it must be shared between all possible \u2022 \nusers. This is a severe limitation for Earth    observation    satellites that would bene fi t \nfrom large data throughputs. Therefore, the diversi fi cation of the ground station \nlocation and the increase of the receiving antenna directivity are preferred methods \nto the frequency diversi fi cation.    \n\n In near-Earth    orbit missions, the power reaching the ground antenna is usually \nenough for transmitting the necessary data throughput    without the use of large power \nampli fi ers or high-gain antennae. Almost all Earth-orbiting space missions, as well as \nthose downlinking    the maximum allowable data permitted by the bandwidth   , use \nlow-gain antennae   . Cluster    uses omnidirectional antennae, while Sentinel-3    uses a \ncardioid antenna that moderately increases the gain when the satellite is low over the \nground station\u2019s horizon, and reduces the gain when the satellite is  fl ying directly \nover the ground station and the distance between them is minimal. \n\n Cluster    is a good example of a relatively simple data downlink    system. Cluster \nonly carries in situ    instruments    that produce moderate data rates, and its orbit allows \nlong contact periods. This makes ful fi lling the link budget    easy, and leaves ample \nmargin for the allocation of requirements    and the design of all components. \n\n NOAA-POESS    DMS system, described in Section  12.3.4 , provides mission prod-\nucts    to a large number of small antennae, as little as 1 m diameter in the case of the \nL-band    component. The L- and X-band    DMS downlink    broadcast continuously infor-\nmation using low-gain antennae   , and the system was designed to simplify the ground \nstation hardware, and make the system accessible to as many distributed users as pos-\nsible. This creates a situation in which the apportioning of requirements    reduces the \ndif fi culties of the ground segment   , making it easy to design, and minimal for the \nspace system, forcing it to use as much emitting power    as allowed by ITU    regulations \nfor the corresponding bands. \n\n Sentinel-3    does not continuously broadcast information. It downloads and empties \nits entire memory when  fl ying over its main download ground stations   : Kiruna in \nSweden and Svalbard near the North Pole. The principal limiting factor in the design \nof Sentinel-3 was not the availability of hardware, but the stringent regulations. As \nSection  12.4.5  made clear, Earth observation    missions bene fi t from stations near the \npoles. Many Earth observation missions would prefer to downlink    information to \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n445The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\nSvalbard, near the North Pole; they would also prefer to use maximum data through-\nputs and to downlink at every visibility opportunity. It is no accident that both \nSentinel-3 and NOAA POESS    have an X-band    400 Mbit/s downlink system and that \nboth use Svalbard; this is indeed a very attractive solution; the problem is that it could \ngenerate interference between the satellites. \n\n Data relay satellites provide one possible solution to the problem of limitations on \nbandwidth    and power density. Data relay satellites allow the transmission of similar \namounts of data during longer times, reducing the need for high speed and high band-\nwidth use, and permitting downlinks via geostationary satellites with good visibility \nfrom Earth   . \n\n The SafetyNet    system of NOAA-POESS    is another method for radically solving \nthe regulatory problems indicated above. The use of numerous ground stations    \nincreases the allowable contact time and reduces the required data downlink    speed. \nThe ground stations are uniformly distributed around the world, reducing the prob-\nlems caused by congestion over the Poles. A supplementary tool for reducing regula-\ntory problem is that SafetyNet works at Ka-band   . ITU    regulations allow 1.5 GHz in \nKa-band with respect to the 0.3 GHz that they allow in X-band   . That means Ka-band \nprovides a much larger data throughput    capability.  \n\n    12.5.3.   Data latency budget \n\n This section is a continuation of Section  12.4.2  on short versus long data latency   . We \nhave already extensively analyzed the major factors affecting the timeline for data \ndelivery. The four periods discussed were:\n\n    1.    Downlink time, which is fully determined by the orbit, by the location and number \nof ground stations    and by the use or not of data relay satellites    for downlinking   .  \n\n    2.    Low-level processing time. This can be optimized through the use of fast process-\ning algorithms and computers.  \n\n    3.    High-level processing time. This can also be optimized through the use of fast \nprocessing algorithms and computers. However, in the frequent instances that pro-\ncessing requires the use of external information, for example, near real-time, high-\naccuracy orbital data from GPS    satellites, punctual delivery methods for the \nprocessing of this data must be determined.  \n\n    4.    Distribution time. As in 2 and 3 above, this can be reduced by the use of computer-\nized handling, but might also require the use of permanent or semi-permanent \nhuman intervention.     \n\n As explained in Section   11.6.5    , period 1 is deterministic   , and can forego the use of \nsafety margins   , but periods 2, 3, and 4 are functions of the processing algorithms, \ncomputing power, ground communications and infrastructure, the amount of human \nsupport needed, and the delay in the delivery of the external data. This requires the use \nof comfortable safety margins. Also as explained in Section   11.6.5    , the early design of \nground processing and distribution will focus on functional design    and cost    estimation, \nbut will not include a detailed physical design   . This is an additional reason for includ-\ning comfortable safety margins in the planning of time allocated for steps 2, 3, and 4. \nGround processing specialists must determine if the resulting time allocated for 2, 3, \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n446 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nand 4 is realistic and what costs would be associated with implementing a system \ncapable of providing the requested performance. Special care should be given to the \nidenti fi cation of external data and what kind of arrangements are necessary for ensur-\ning the availability    of this external data within the time delays allocated to it. Very \nshort data latency    is of extreme importance for applications such as security, defense, \nor meteorology. To reduce latency    it is necessary to reduce the times required by steps \n1\u20134 of the list above. This will require fast processing and data distribution networks \nbut it will also require a large number of ground stations    and/or the use of data relay \nsatellites   . Section  12.3.4  introduced the SafetyNet    TM  set of 15 ground stations for \nreducing the data latency of the data used for operational meteorology   . Such a complex \nstructure was implemented in order to provide the quickest delivery of meteorological \nsatellites and the swiftest delivery of weather forecasts. This is especially useful when \ndealing with fast and extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes or  fl oods. The \nfollowing  fi gures provide the latency  fi gures for different ground station networks for \na single satellite in Sun   -synchronous orbit    at an altitude of 800 km, the most frequently \nused orbit for operational meteorology missions. The following  fi gures depicts pro-\ngressively more complicated architectures that will reduce the data latency \n\n A single ground station in Svalbard provides a downlink time that  fl uctuates between \na few minutes \u2013 for observations acquired just before downlink    \u2013 to 70 min for observa-\ntions acquired just after losing contact with Svalbard (Figure  12.13 ) and that are \ndelayed until renewed contact is made nearly one orbital period    later. Three supplemen-\ntary ground stations    uniformly distributed along the Equator    only moderately improve \nthese latency     fi gures (Figure  12.14 ). A dramatic improvement would be provided by the \nuse of data relay satellites    (Figure  12.15 ). One single data relay satellite would reduce \nthe latency over roughly one-third of the Earth   , while three would afford rapid delivery \nabove the entire planet. The infrastructure investment for a comprehensive data relay \nsatellite network is costly. The SafetyNetTM network described in Section  12.3.4  also \ndramatically reduces latency times (Figure  12.16 ) over the whole globe but implemen-\ntation of the necessary 15 ground stations also requires heavy investment.     \n\n Satellites often produce large amounts of data, and sending data to Earth    is just the \n fi rst step; it must also be delivered to processing centers. Overall latency    calculations \nmust also include transfer speed of the data from the receiving ground station to the \nprocessing and distribution centers. Transfer speeds to processing and distribution \ncenters will vary according to the geographical location of the different ground sta-\ntions   . Figure  12.17  provides the estimated transfer speeds from different ground sta-\ntion locations. The  fi gures vary considerably depending on the nature and availability    \nof communications infrastructures. The network evaluated here belongs to a possible \nnext generation European operational meteorological satellite system.  \n\n Svalbard and other European stations can use special high-speed networks able \nto provide up to 10\u201320 Gbps. Equatorial stations, however, have much slower rates. \nA data relay satellite    can deliver directly to the processing center   . McMurdo ground \nstation in Antarctica, has, like Svalbard, very good downlink    contact patterns with \npolar satellites. Nevertheless, delivery of the data from the station to the processing \ncenter is slow. It is evident that the space mission appraised in the  fi gure must share \nthe communication links with other users, which means the data throughput    available \nfor the mission is only a fraction of the total. A thorough end-to-end design perspec-\ntive should take into account all these \u201cnonspace\u201d factors.         \n\n\n\n447The Instrument Output Data Flow Domain\n\n  Figure 12.13.

Sections   4.5     \nand   4.6     described the different kinds of space projects; Section   4.8     analyzed costs and \nhow to evaluate them; Section   4.9.3     examined the development approach    and model \nphilosophy   ; Section   5.3.1     looked at low cost    designs. The following chapter will \nagain consider the topic, providing a synthesized view, and examining cost reduction    \napproaches proposed in the recent and not so recent past. \n\n We will begin by reviewing which technical and nontechnical factors contribute \nmost to the high cost    of space missions. This will be followed by a section examining \nmethods of cost reduction    and evaluating both their bene fi ts and limitations. Three \npreviously studied methods will be examined further, and the potential of small satel-\nlites    as cost savers will be discussed at length. The next section will analyze possible \ncost reductions in situations when the sponsor    and the consumer    are the same, while \nthe last section will look at missions with a low novelty level that can be implemented \nwithout a customer   . \n\n    13.1.   The space mission and cost \n\n To begin with, space missions are expensive because they are highly complex and \ndif fi cult to implement. There are obvious physical reasons that make a satellite an \nexpensive piece of hardware: space is an unfriendly environment: a vacuum is incom-\npatible with most common lubricants, and makes convective heat transfer impossible, \nwhile space radiation degrades electronics    and other satellite components. The \nweightlessness of space, on the other hand, favors large, slender structures    that are \nimpossible in the Earth   \u2019s atmosphere, though for the same reason testing them on the \nground is complex and expensive. Launchers   , used to put satellites in orbit provide a \nbrief but demanding ride that requires satellite structures to be strong, rigid, and com-\npact. Launchers are expensive and satellites must be light to  fl y on them. The intrinsic \nphysical dif fi culties provided by launch conditions and the space environment    are \ncompounded by the fact that satellites carry advanced scienti fi c instruments    likely to \nbe on the leading edge of technical developments. Another particular feature of space \nmissions is the need for the engineering to be reliable, as  fi xing a failed spacecraft is \n\n    Chapter 13   \n\n Space Missions Cost and Alternative Design Approaches       \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\n\n\n452 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nnot easy and usually not possible. Hence, the technology and components used must \nbe of high quality and provide the necessary redundancy in its architectures and \ndetailed design. Further, the provision of the design and associated veri fi cation of the \ndesign requires the use of highly trained personnel and specialized facilities, both of \nwhich are costly to provide and use. \n\n There are two supplementary nontechnical factors that make satellites expensive:\n\n   Many \u2013 indeed most \u2013 satellites are unique.  \u2022 \n  Space missions are usually paid for by someone other than those who most \u2022 \ndirectly bene fi t from it.    \n\n The satellite\u2019s uniqueness suggests that its realization is the result of original, \ntechnically dif fi cult design processes that can rarely be copied from well-known \nprecedents. Furthermore, being unique, failure of the mission means consumers    com-\npletely lose the opportunities offered by the mission in the  fi rst place. A scientist or \noperational user \u2013 for instance an operational meteorologist \u2013 would garner little \nsatisfaction from knowing that the mission was insured if it should fail; he wants his \ndata, not his money back. \n\n Satellites must operate correctly, with an extremely high level of reliability, the \nvery  fi rst time it reaches its intended environment. This means its design must incor-\nporate ample safety margins   , conservative testing and thorough analysis, combined \nwith a project philosophy of \u201cfailure is unacceptable.\u201d All these factors result in high \ncosts. \n\n The fact that space missions must answer to two masters, the sponsor    and the \nconsumer   , is another factor affecting costs. The consumer\u2019s priority is to achieve a \nmission that ful fi lls all his aims with an unprecedented level of quality. The sponsor \npossesses the  fi nal authority to commit the funds required by the mission, though he \nwill not be directly involved in the day-to-day aspects of mission de fi nition, and his \nonly real choice is to either cancel the mission or demand drastic reductions in per-\nformance criteria to satisfy the available funds. Both these alternatives seem extreme, \nbut real-life experience shows that most satellites are overspeci fi ed, overdesigned, \nand overcost   . This situation repeats itself in nearly all missions attempting to advance \nour knowledge of the physical world. In these kinds of missions, problems such as \nthis are nearly impossible to solve, but they can be alleviated by prompt and energetic \ndebate about mission requirements    relaxations between the customer, supplier,    and \nthe consumer. \n\n Most discussions about cost    reduction focuses on reducing the expense of the \nsatellite platform   , but a healthy approach to the issue of space mission costs should \ncenter on a balanced reduction of all the relevant aspects: ground segment   , launcher   , \ninstruments,    and satellite platform. The standardization of satellite platforms offers a \ngood opportunity for reducing expenditures. Nevertheless, the issue of reducing the \ncost of instruments    is a complex one, because instruments differ so greatly according \nto their applications. Each new mission requires new instruments, and new as well as \nambitious ones require ambitious new instruments. There are few reliable launchers \nand these are usually expensive. Efforts to design an affordable launch method, \ncapable of putting a satellite into orbit have been constant for more than 40 years; the \nspace shuttle, introduced in the 1970s, was supposed to reduce the cost of putting \npayloads into orbit by a factor of 10. In the 1990s, private initiatives tried to further \n\n\n\n453Space Missions Cost and Alternative Design Approaches\n\nreduce launch costs, but failed. The lack of small, reliable, and inexpensive launchers \nis hindering the development of satellites with these same characteristics. \n\n Ground-related mission costs: satellite operations    and mission data processing and \ndistribution constitute a sizable portion of the total mission cost   . Furthermore, as \nthese activities are ground-based as well as strongly based on information technolo-\ngies, we could have assumed that costs related to this area would be decreasing dra-\nmatically, in parallel with the development of ever more powerful and inexpensive \ninformation technology. This is not the case, however. This can be explained as a \nresult of the enormous amounts of data that space missions are now providing, and \nthe increasingly large consumer    communities that make use of this data. This requires \nmassive storage and processing capabilities,  fl exible interfacing with consumers   , and \n fl exible satellite operations to adequately respond to the different needs of each mem-\nber of the consumer community. While it is true that advances in information technol-\nogy are transforming the way space missions are implemented, the changes tend \ntoward better performance levels at moderately lower cost, than in the direction of \nconstant performance levels at dramatically lower cost. \n\n Another way to reduce costs is to seek funding from a third party. Although \n fi nancing the mission\u2019s instruments    might ensure real savings for the mission\u2019s prin-\ncipal backer, overall costs are not actually reduced, they are just transferred. Taking \nadvantage of free launch opportunities or being launched piggyback    beside a primary \nmission that is paying for the launch can provide real cost    reductions, but this \napproach is only feasible for a small percentage of all missions; obviously, the entire \nspace effort cannot  fl y piggyback. \n\n Given the points examined above, it is important to realize that not all space mis-\nsions are equal and that cost   -saving measures might be advisable for some missions \nbut not for others. This is often forgotten, and cost reduction    strategies are frequently \npresented by their defenders as the whole solution instead of what they actually are; \npart of the solution.  \n\n    13.2.   Methods of cost reduction \n\n This section is divided into subsections examining different cost    reduction methods. \nThe  fi rst three methods were discussed at length in previous chapters; the following \nprovides a  fi nal synthesis. These are:\n\n   Cost reduction by proper architectural de fi nition  \u2022 \n  Cost reduction by hardware solutions  \u2022 \n  Cost reduction by programmatic solutions    \u2022 \n\n The  fi nal subsection is devoted to small satellites    and introduces several new \ntopics. \n\n    13.2.1.   Proper architectural de fi nition \n\n As indicated in the previous section, the architect    must answer to two clients: the spon-\nsor    and the consumer   , whose interests, far from similar, are contradictory. The con-\nsumer\u2019s priority is ensuring superior mission performances, while the sponsor\u2019s is for \n\n\n\n454 Introduction to Space Systems\n\ncontaining costs. The architectural de fi nition phases    must reconcile this contradiction \nto deliver value to the consumer while containing costs in line with the sponsor\u2019s \ndesires. In order to reconcile the two con fl icting aims it is crucial to view the design \nprocess    not as the ful fi llment of the requirements    but as evolving together with the \nrequirements until they reach a mutual balance. Achieving this balance necessarily \nreduces costs because it results in the least expensive mission still capable of meeting \nthe fundamental needs of the consumer. \n\n Figure   1.1     shows that missions with a well-funded architectural de fi nition phases    \nhave small cost    overruns, thus reducing overall costs. Section   5.3.1     examined the \napparent contradiction that increasing costs at the beginning of a mission reduces \ncosts at the end. This is not surprising. A deliberate and well-funded architectural \nde fi nition stage prior to project approval permits:\n\n   Negotiating a reduction of the consumer   \u2019s requirements    in as optimal a manner as \u2022 \npossible  \n  Agreement on an optimal design that ful fi lls the consumer   \u2019s  fi nal set of require-\u2022 \nments    while minimizing the sponsor   \u2019s costs and both of their risks  \n  The production of a comprehensive and detailed system speci fi cation that is com-\u2022 \npletely free of open or unde fi ned points  \n  Providing maturity to key technologies required by the mission    \u2022 \n\n Chapter   3     analyzed the establishment of requirements    and the creation of \nspeci fi cations   , and made clear that establishing requirements was an interactive pro-\ncess, involving constant feedback between the consumer   \u2019s needs and the hard techni-\ncal realities those needs entail and which the supplier    brings to the attention of the \narchitectural de fi nition team. This process (see Section   3.2    ) produces a chain of \nspeci fi cations with increasing levels of concreteness. Simultaneously, the mission\u2019s \n fi nal design is being realized through a process of production, analysis, and selection \nof alternatives (see Chapter   5    ). The mission\u2019s architectural de fi nition process advances \nstep by step through a series of milestones (see Chapter   6    ) until both the speci fi cation \nand the mission design are  fi nally de fi ned together. \n\n In order to achieve an ideal trade-off    between requirements    and the design \nresponding to them, several factors are essential:\n\n   A mathematical model able to provide end-to-end mission effectiveness    for the \u2022 \nalternative concepts under consideration. The distinct concepts might be ful fi lling \ndifferent sets of requirements    for different levels of dif fi culty. Mission effective-\nness models were discussed in Sections   3.4    ,   5.6    , and   8.5    .  \n  A  fl exible cost estimatio   n tool able to provide realistic cost forecasts for each \u2022 \nalternative. This was discussed in Section   4.8    .  \n  Common sense, in order to clearly understand that the reality behind the  fi nal \u2022 \nperformances and costs is far more complicated and subtle than the  fi gures pro-\nvided by the cost    and performance models. This was discussed in Section   5.6.2    .    \n\n Section   5.4     ended with a reference to the heuristic that states: \u201c The last 10 % of the \nperformance sought generates 1/3 of the costs and 2/3 of the problems .\u201d According \nto that heuristic, obtaining a reduction of this last 10 % of performance from the con-\nsumer    before receiving a fully funded project approval will mean a substantial decrease \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_6\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\n\n\n455Space Missions Cost and Alternative Design Approaches\n\nin overall costs and schedule   . An additional tool for convincing consumers    to accept a \nnominal relaxation of requirements    is the fact that \u2013 due to the existence of explicit as \nwell as hidden safety margins    \u2013 real space missions that do not fail catastrophically will \nusually perform better than speci fi ed. This was discussed in Section   5.6.3    . \n\n Finally, it should be remembered that the mission\u2019s existence is due to the con-\nsumer   , and he shall be the ultimate authority on the degree of requirements    relaxation; \nafter all, the consumer has the right to mandate an unaffordable mission! \n\n These methods for reducing costs are independent of all others: they are equally \napplicable to missions with high or low risk    acceptance, small or large satellites, and \nexpensive or less expensive missions. The only case to which they are not applicable \nare those where there is an extremely low level of novelty; if there is an existing satel-\nlite that adequately ful fi lls the consumer   \u2019s needs within the cost    constraints de fi ned \nby the sponsor   , then there is no need for an architectural de fi nition phase. Then it is \nsimply a question of purchasing the satellite, as is often the case for standard com-\nmunication satellites   .  \n\n    13.2.2.   Hardware optimization \n\n The history of space travel has shown that it is possible to reduce the costs of mis-\nsions by designing standardized or reusable satellite hardware. Section   4.11     discussed \nseveral trends that have been in fl uential in the past; of these, the following were \nhardware related:\n\n   In the 1970s, use of reusable launchers, namely, the space shuttle  \u2022 \n  In the 1980s, using replaceable orbital units allowing in-orbit servicing by astronauts  \u2022 \n  In the 1980s and 1990s, using standard platforms   ;  \u2022 \n  Standard plug-and-play electronic subsystems    \u2022 \n\n The biggest push has been toward standardization, including entire standard satel-\nlite platforms. This was discussed above in Section   10.5.3    , where it was shown that \ndue to the diverse payloads carried by satellites and the varied environments in which \nthey  fl y, successful standardization is not easily accomplished. Moreover, standard \nsatellite platforms force payloads to adapt themselves to the previously designed \nplatform. This inevitably complicates the most dif fi cult and expensive part of the \nmission \u2013 the payload or instruments    \u2013 to gain a cost    reduction in the cheapest \u2013the \nsatellite platform   . \n\n On the other hand, standard platforms    have shown success in missions featuring \nsatellites  fl ying in similar environments and with similar instruments   , such as those \nmaking meteorological or environmental observations from low Earth orbit    or from \nthe geostationary position, as well as for communication satellites   . Most communica-\ntion satellites  fl y in the same orbit, and are functionally quite similar, acting as pipe-\nlines providing communications bandwidth   , and their payloads are mostly similar \nfrom one mission to the next. This success of standardization for communications \nmissions is demonstrated by the fact that almost all communication satellites are built \nusing standard platforms that can accommodate different types of payloads, depend-\ning on the application. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n456 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n Standardization is also sometimes advantageous for science satellites. Herschel    \nand Planck are two ESA science satellites  fl ying in the same orbit but with totally \ndifferent payloads. However, both payloads have similar basic shapes and their \nrequirements    are not dramatically different. They both use a common satellite plat-\nform   , thus reducing overall costs. The savings is also shared by satellite operations    \nbecause both communications and commanding can be similarly handled. \n\n In the late 1980s ESA tried to reduce the cost    of its Soho    and Cluster    satellites by \nusing common components for both of them, but analysis demonstrated that imposing \ncommon elements actually increased the cost of the satellites, because the shape, \ninstruments   , requirements,    and orbits of both missions were completely different. The \nonly thing they had in common was that they were to start at the same time and both \nwere going to study the Sun    and Sun-Earth    interactions. \n\n The conclusion to be drawn is that cost    reduction through hardware standardiza-\ntion or commonality is mainly effective when missions are similar. In most cases cost \nreductions associated with these methods will not be dramatic, because the hardware \nmust still be able to cope with the demanding environment of space, and the instru-\nments    will be new because they must be able to provide the new data and mission \nproducts    demanded by the consumer   . Nevertheless it is possible to reduce costs mod-\nerately by standardization of instrument, components, interfaces, or software   .  \n\n    13.2.3.   Organization optimization \n\n The organization of space projects is a complex undertaking. Traditional projects \ninvolve an industrial consortium of suppliers with a prime contractor    responsible for \nthe satellite, and with various levels of specialized subcontractors    for the different \nsubsystem    assemblies and parts inside the satellite. The industrial consortium is \ndirected by a permanent project team at the space agency that acts as the customer   . \nThis permanent team is supported in turn by technical experts that offer advice on \nspeci fi c issues. The industrial contractors provide the assemblies under their respon-\nsibility, supported by data packages substantiating their adequacy and allowing inte-\ngration into larger assemblies on up to the satellite level. Both the satellite and \ninstruments    have to be properly documented for the purpose of satellite operations   . \nThe establishment of the infrastructure and training needed for satellite operations are \nnormally projects carried out independently from the satellite itself. Product assur-\nance    consists of an independent set of experts that make sure that the progressively \nlarger assemblies have been produced and tested according to the agreed-on proce-\ndures. Last but not least, there is a chain of review milestones where experts external \nto the project certify the adequacy \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 of the work done up to the \nmilestone. All this is very complicated, generates a large amount of documentation, \nand involves large numbers of people checking each other and using complex proce-\ndures and communication channels. This cumbersome approach was developed early \nin the history of space endeavors    because space exploration was rightly judged as an \nespecially dif fi cult undertaking. Indeed, today the most likely source of mission mal-\nfunction is launcher    failure, and most successfully launched satellites have demon-\nstrated a high level of reliability, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of this \ncumbersome methodology. \n\n\n\n457Space Missions Cost and Alternative Design Approaches\n\n Claims that this complex scheme can be greatly simpli fi ed for all types of projects \nwith a low impact on the actual quality of the  fi nal product have long been heard. So \ntoo have claims that different projects should be handled with different levels of \nthoroughness, and that the most exhaustive project organization should be limited to \nhigh-priority projects with an extreme level of complexity, those providing unique \nopportunities, requiring extended mission life,    and that push the frontiers of the state \nof the art. Section   4.5     presented various missions according to their aims and how \nthey had different levels of tolerance to risk   . Section   4.6     discussed projects according \nto their criticality and how they can be classi fi ed using objective criteria along a con-\ntinuous scale of risk tolerance, and how projects of lower levels of criticality could \nreduce costs by relaxing quality assurance standards. The following organizational \nchanges can be used to reduce project costs:\n\n   Simpli fi cation of the model philosophy   . This was discussed in Section  \u2022  4.9.3    .  \n  Reduction of the formal quality of components.  \u2022 \n  Reduction of the number of formal project reviews   .  \u2022 \n  Reduction of the formality and deliberateness of formal project reviews   .  \u2022 \n  General simpli fi cation of the communication channels and reduction of the amount \u2022 \nof documentation to be produced.    \n\n This approach, which advocates a progressive but cautious reduction in project \ncomplexity, is now  fi rmly established. Nevertheless, during the 1990s, a more revo-\nlutionary than evolutionary approach to project simpli fi cation was proposed. This \nradical approach was associated with management trends of the period such as \n\u201cfaster, cheaper, better   \u201d or reengineering, which recommended a fundamental review \nof the procedures used to implement and operate complex systems. This trend, exam-\nined in Section   4.11    , did sometimes work, but failed as well, mainly when applied to \ncomplex, ambitious missions (Figure  13.1 ).  \n\n We can conclude that a simpli fi cation of project organization reduces costs but \nunavoidably increases risks, which is certainly not advisable for dif fi cult missions \nrequiring the implementation of new techniques that advance the state of the art. \nHowever, projects managed by a lean organization have been able to deliver moder-\nately complex satellites with tighter costs and schedules than would have been pos-\nsible using conventional approaches; ESA\u2019s Giove-A    is a good example of this.  \n\n    13.2.4.   Organization and hardware centered: small simple satellites \nwithin a lean project organization \n\n The previous section concluded that a lean project organization increases risk   . Surrey \nSatellite Technology pioneered an approach that used a lean project organization for \nsatellites that were designed to be tolerant to the resulting risk increase. This required \nthat the mission\u2019s aims were modest and that the satellite design was robust. Robust \ndesign was de fi ned in Section   5.3.1     as simple, employing well-proven and  fi t-for-\npurpose technologies. The modest mission aims ensured that the instruments    required \nmoderate levels of novelty or risk. The DMC    series of satellites (Section   11.4.4    ) is \nthe best example of this approach, which almost always uses small satellites   . The use \nof small satellites has been promoted as a way to deliver large, even dramatic cost    \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_11\n\n\n458 Introduction to Space Systems\n\nreductions. Small satellites provide real potential for large cost reduction   . Of course, \nsmall satellites are nothing new. The  fi rst American satellite, Explorer-1, launched in \n1958, weighed just 14 kg. So small satellites are not a \u201cnew paradigm\u201d; but recent \nmissions featuring small satellites have been able to deliver reasonable performance \nat very low prices. There are a few main reasons that small satellites cost less:\n\n   Small satellites can be built by small teams, and small teams have simpler com-\u2022 \nmunication channels. This allows a major reduction in the tasks associated with \nthe creation, maintenance, and distribution of documentation.  \n  In small teams every member knows the problems experienced by other members. \u2022 \nThis allows fast and easy solutions to interface problems where engineering area \nA could be helped by actions in engineering area B.  \n  Small satellites often, though not always, have modest aims. Modest aims entail \u2022 \nless demanding requirements   , simpler instruments   , lower risk,    and simpler \ndesign.  \n  Small satellites need smaller facilities with lower overhead costs.  \u2022 \n  The loss of a small satellite would not be a total catastrophe because a new one \u2022 \ncan be built at a reasonable price. This means that each satellite can be built with \nlean organizational approaches and lower levels of product assurance    and \nreliability.  \n  Missions employing small satellites    often  fl y several in a constellation. The failure \u2022 \nof a single satellite will not  fi nish the mission, but only reduce the amount of data \nproduced. This permits lower levels of product assurance   , redundancy, and numer-\nical reliability.    \n\n0\n0\n\nC\no\n\nst\n (\n\nF\nY\n\n02\n$M\n\n)\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300 Successful\n\nTotal Flight System Cost as Function of Complexity\n\nFailed Missions\n\ny = 2.7542e5.0696x\n\nR2 = 0.7157\n\nImpaired Missions\n\nTo-be-determined\n\nExpon.

David Bearden, The \nAerospace Corporation 2001 MAPLD International Conference).       \n\n \n\n\n\n459Space Missions Cost and Alternative Design Approaches\n\n This means that small satellites    are naturally adapted to the use of a lean project \norganization. There is a balance between all the mission\u2019s conditions: hardware, \norganization, and aims that favors reduced costs. \n\n Missions employing small satellites    are often technology demonstration missions, \nbut there are no intrinsic reasons preventing small satellites from addressing new \nscienti fi c uses or ful fi lling relevant operational functions. This is especially true for \nmissions using a constellation of small satellites. Constellations were discussed at \nlength in Sections   7.3.1     and   9.10    . It is evident that for some applications many small, \nsimple satellites can provide performances comparable with one large complicated \nsatellite. Furthermore, the use of synthetic aperture techniques could solve the limita-\ntions that physical laws impose on the resolution of instruments    with small real aper-\ntures. Synthetic aperture techniques, however, have limitations and Section   8.6.3     \ndiscussed the strengths and weaknesses of synthetic aperture techniques. Optical \naperture synthesis    imposes extremely demanding parameters in the relative position \nbetween small satellites, which must  fl y in tight formation. Optical aperture synthesis \nvia multiple satellites is likely to increase not reduce costs. Again, it is necessary to \ncontrast management approaches with the laws of physics to ensure that the proposed \nsolution will actually work. It can be concluded that a constellation of small satellites \ncan perform some, but not all, of the functions performed by large complicated \nsatellites. \n\n Hence, while it is true that small satellites    are economical, it is untrue that by \nsimply making a satellite smaller, while maintaining all its requirements    will neces-\nsarily make the satellite cheaper. It has been said: \u201c The cost      of any system correlates \nwell with mass, but to decrease the mass of a given system increases costs .\u201d  1  \n\n It is obvious that to ful fi ll a given set of requirements    while being severely mass \nconstrained is more dif fi cult \u2013 and more expensive \u2013 than ful fi lling the same set of \nrequirements without being mass constrained. Not being mass constrained also \npermits the use of standard, nonoptimal, off-the-shelf components that are not only \ncheaper to acquire but also allow a reduction in testing due to the good characteriza-\ntion and wide safety margins    they provide. A robust small satellite is indeed quite \nheavy when compared with alternative mass-optimized designs, performing the \nsame functions. In extreme cases, the use of nanosatellites and nanotechnology has \nbeen proposed as a promising and dramatic way to reduce the design costs of space \nmissions. This has created a push for miniaturization employing the innovations of \ninformation technology. Nevertheless, the translation of concepts between engi-\nneering domains can be misleading. As G. Helmeier, director of Darpa, once said: \n\u201cIf the automotive industry had progressed during the last two decades at the same \nrate as microprocessors have, Rolls Royces would today cost    just $3.00 and cars \nwould measure just a quarter of an inch a side.\u201c Helmeier\u2019s statement is an interest-\ning metaphor, though as a literal statement it is inaccurate because a family car \nneeds to be large enough to  fi t a family, of humans, not amoebas. It is clear that the \nlaws of physics do not scale well, and shrinking a satellite has intrinsic limits that \nwill not disappear. \n\n   1  Augustine\u2019s Laws, Norman R. Augustine, AIAA 1983.  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_9\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_8\n\n\n460 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n Besides the above-mentioned limitations regarding aperture limits, reducing a \nsatellite\u2019s size produces changes in the relative complexity of the satellite\u2019s differ-\nent subsystems. When a satellite is scaled down, its mass decreases at a greater rate \nthan the strength    and stiffness    of its structural elements. This seems to imply that \nsmall satellites    will possess strong, light structures   . Nevertheless, extremely thin \nstructures tend to suffer malfunctions such as buckling that thicker structures avoid, \nand extremely thin structures are incompatible with human handling or conven-\ntional manufacturing methods. The use of nanotechnology can indeed make feasible \nsome missions, such as interplanetary probes, where mass and volume have a strong \npremium, but it is unlikely to provide any far-reaching revolution to the space mis-\nsion  fi eld. To continue growing, the space community needs to reduce costs and this \ncan be achieved by designing satellites to be as light and small as possible, but not \n1 g more. \n\n Two supplementary problems associated with small and nanosatellites that limit \ntheir actual usefulness are those related to launching and disposal. The widespread \nuse of very small satellites    would require practical ways to place them in orbit and \nonce their mission has been completed, practical ways of removing them from those \norbits where they would become dangerous  fl ying debris   . \n\n Most current small launchers    have injection capabilities of around 1,000 kg to low \nEarth    orbit. It is extremely unlikely that this situation will change in the foreseeable \nfuture, because the development of reliable new launchers, small or large, is a long, \ncomplicated, and risky process. So there are no extra-small launchers optimized for \nextra-small satellites   , and it is not likely that this situation will change anytime soon. \nNonetheless, there are two practical ways to put small satellites into orbit:\n\n   By piggyback    on a larger satellite that employs \u2013 and pays for \u2013 most launcher    \u2022 \ncosts  \n  Multiple small satellites    that share a launcher    dedicated to all of them    \u2022 \n\n While both these possibilities are viable and practical, neither is fully \nsatisfactory. \n\n In cases where a small satellite  fl ies piggyback    on a larger one, the latter will dic-\ntate the injection orbit and the former will end up in an orbit that is unlikely to be an \noptimal one for its mission. This limits the usefulness of the piggyback approach to \ntechnology demonstration missions whose only aim is to demonstrate the feasibility \nof the small satellite or a speci fi c technology, and does not require a speci fi c orbit; \nonce feasibility has been proven, each new \u201creal\u201d application would call for a particu-\nlar orbit. In some cases the large satellite\u2019s orbit might coincide with one that is suit-\nable for the small satellite, but this means designing the smaller satellite\u2019s mission \naround a lucky accident. \n\n The launching of a constellation of mini-satellites by a small launcher    would \nappear to be a sensible technical solution for ful fi lling the requirements    of a demand-\ning mission. They would be launched into an orbit suitable to all of them, and would \nuse the small launcher\u2019s capacity ef fi ciently. However, packing a large number of \nmini-satellites inside a launcher fairing    (see Figures   10.4     and   10.5    ) is no simple mat-\nter. For very small satellites   , the use of some kind of central structure where they can \nbe attached is required (see Figure   10.4    ), as well as a special mechanism for releasing \nthe satellites one by one in a controlled fashion. All of these elements require mass \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_10\n\n\n461Space Missions Cost and Alternative Design Approaches\n\nand space under the launcher fairing. Hence, it is not in fact possible to launch ten \n100 kg satellites in a launcher designed to put 1,000 kg in orbit, and even accommo-\ndating four or  fi ve 100 kg satellites is no easy task. The reality, then, diminishes the \napparent attractiveness of small satellites. The problem only increases when going \nfrom small to mini-satellites; the number of 1 kg satellites that can be practically \nstowed inside a 1,000 kg launcher fairing is very unlikely to be above 100. \nFurthermore, designing and manufacturing a structure capable of holding all of them \nduring launch and releasing into orbit would be neither cheap nor easy. \n\n The problem of satellite disposal is especially critical for very small satellites   :\n\n   Any practical use of very small or nanosatellites will entail the use of a large num-\u2022 \nber of them. Once their mission was complete, they would become potentially \ndangerous space debris   .  \n  Small satellites are unlikely to be able to carry on-board fuel or other components \u2022 \nfor changing their orbit altitude    in order to remove themselves from the region \nwhere they pose a danger. The problem would be compounded because the deor-\nbiting    hardware would have to be extremely reliable to ensure that most, ideally \nall, the satellites shall indeed be removed.    \n\n The problem of small satellite disposal remains unsolved and it will be dif fi cult to \n fi nd a comprehensive solution, thus calling into question any proposal for the imple-\nmentation of space missions employing a very large number of mini or \nnanosatellites. \n\n Small satellites with modest aims and managed by lean teams have demonstrated \ntheir ability to provide exceedingly good value for the money invested. They perform \nwell in technology demonstrations, and can provide adequate services to consumers    \nwith moderate aims. Small satellite constellations    can also provide alternative solu-\ntions for some, though by no means all missions. Hence, very small or nanosatellites \nmight enable a number of special missions, but they will not be used extensively until \nthe dif fi cult problems associated with them can be solved, even though they provide \ndramatic cost    savings.   \n\n    13.3.   Projects without the duality sponsor   /consumer    \n\n This book is based on the four principal players involved in the process of undertak-\ning a new space mission. These four players, the consumer   , the sponsor   , the customer,    \nand the supplier    (Figure   1.2    ) are implicit throughout the entire book. This basic \nframework underlies all classical space missions with large-scale aims, handled by a \nspace agency and  fi nanced with public funds. Not all space missions use this organi-\nzation, however. For instance, the dichotomy between sponsor and consumer is \nabsent in privately funded space missions. As a principal objective for owners of a \nprivately funded satellite is to generate pro fi ts, they will avoid expensive features not \nlikely to produce an adequate return on their investment. This will automatically \neliminate the supplementary costs associated with the customer\u2019s wish for ambitious \nmission objectives when there are limited funds available. Privately funded missions \ntypically allow for a faster and less-convoluted establishment of mission require-\nments    and the subsequent design process   . \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1_1\n\n\n462 Introduction to Space Systems\n\n Moreover, as private owners can insure their mission, they can reduce the level of \nmission reliability, with the knowledge that they will be fully compensated in case of \nfailure. This means that issues associated with space mission uniqueness are reduced. \nIt is the responsibility of the insurer to determine the level of premiums according to \nthe mission\u2019s product assurance    and reliability. Missions lacking the sponsor   -con-\nsumer    duality permit cost    reduction methods not easily applied to those in which the \nduality exits.  \n\n    13.4.   Projects with a very low level of novelty, projects \nwithout customer    \n\n The subject of this book is proper mission architectural de fi nition. It is appropriate \nthen that this last section will serve to point out that not all projects need such a pro-\ncess. As we have seen, the customer   \u2019s task was to interpret the wishes of the consum-\ners   , while taking into account the constraints and guidelines provided by the sponsor   , \nas well as analyzing the supplier   \u2019s design. This scheme assumes that the customer \nneeds something new that requires interpretation. However, consumer    needs that can \nbe ful fi lled by an already existing, reliable satellite that  fi ts the budget determined by \nthe sponsor do not require any architectural de fi nition. The resulting mission does not \nneed a customer. The supplier will simply provide the existing hardware able to ful fi ll \nthe speci fi ed needs, for which he will be paid. \n\n In cases where the sponsor    and the consumer    is the same person, the situation is \neven simpler. Imagine a buyer that wants to acquire an off-the-shelf system from a \nsupplier    at a  fi rm,  fi xed priced. This can occur for situations requiring fairly standard \ncommunication satellites    or to ful fi ll Earth   -observing needs that can be met by \nalready existing instruments    and satellites. It is obvious that an existing space system \nwith a proven track record of reliable in-orbit performance can be delivered at greatly \nreduced cost   . In cases such as this, all activities related to design can be eliminated, \nand those associated with ensuring product quality, including testing, can be mini-\nmized. It is also sometimes possible to pay for the satellite only after it has been put \ninto orbit and demonstrated that is functioning properly.  \n\n    13.5.   Cost engineering as art and science \n\n It shall always be recalled that cost    estimation is as much an art and not a science, \nand its output is always subject to interpretation. A \u201ccost\u201d is in fact most likely to be \nthe basis of negotiations between the supplier    and customer   . The assessment of a \n\u201ccost\u201d is always subject to the commercial pressures of the speci fi c circumstances \nthat apply at a particular time; it will be affected by the commercial entities involved, \nand must be treated with caution. Further, the cost estimates are produced by \u201ccom-\npany con fi dential\u201d procedures that are anything but universal, and may be the subject \nof quite different assumptions and assumed boundary conditions or constraints by the \nsupplier organizations bidding for a program. Hence, comparisons require yet further \njudgments being applied before an assigned cost is approved. Therefore, when costs \n\n\n\n463Space Missions Cost and Alternative Design Approaches\n\nare calculated there is much scope for error being made and commercial risk    for all \nconcerned. The space agencies have the bene fi t of collating program costs for a mul-\ntitude of programs over many years from many suppliers and these can form the basis \nof making generic cost estimation    tools. However, this process is still fraught with \npotential sources of error, which must be taken into account, such as ensuring that the \nevolution in technologies, system performances, and even fundamental changes in \narchitectures are not grouped inappropriately. In effect, a program\u2019s cost is part of a \nlegally binding    commercial agreement between the parties involved, and as such \nrepresents a judgment on the part of the individuals concerned, with the bene fi t of \npast experience playing a major role.        \n\n\n\n465M.A. Aguirre, Introduction to Space Systems: Design and Synthesis, Space Technology Library 27, \nDOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3758-1, \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n465\n\n  A \n  Absolute Knowledge Error (AKE) , 284, 298, \n\n299, 302   \n  Absolute pointing error (APE) requirement , 284   \n  Absorptivity , 315   \n  Accelerometers , 192, 235, 335, 336, 361   \n  Accommodation requirements , 192   \n  Accuracy , 46, 54, 59, 61, 89, 113, 150, 151, \n\n157, 176, 184, 186, 192\u2013194, 202\u2013204, \n213, 215, 216, 223, 234\u2013237, 245, 246, \n249, 251, 260, 263, 265, 268\u2013271, 286, \n289, 290, 293, 297\u2013299, 303, 306, 334, \n340, 371, 372, 397, 399, 408, 410, 411, \n420, 427, 428, 443, 445   \n\n  Acoustic chambers , 328   \n  Acoustic noise , 326, 328   \n  Acquisition delay , 211\u2013212, 402, 403, 413   \n  Across-track , 183, 184, 194, 199, 217, 219, \n\n268, 272, 303, 344, 355   \n  Active antennae , 190, 191   \n  Active cooling , 365   \n  Active microwave instruments , 37, 111, \n\n177, 180, 188\u2013191   \n  Active optical instruments , 37, 180, \n\n185\u2013186, 188   \n  Advancement of sciences mission , 72\u201374, \n\n76, 87, 104, 150, 157, 179, 421, 422, \n436, 438   \n\n  Aeolus , 150, 178, 179, 193\u2013195, 201, 209, \n211, 220, 250, 291   \n\n  Aerodynamic forces , 229, 239, 240, 330, 331   \n  Agile , 151, 185, 212, 248, 272, 342, 355   \n  Agile satellites , 227, 236, 270, 272, 273, 293, \n\n304, 305, 355\u2013356, 365, 378   \n  Agility , 170, 212, 234, 248, 271, 272, 303\u2013304, \n\n355, 356   \n  AHP.
