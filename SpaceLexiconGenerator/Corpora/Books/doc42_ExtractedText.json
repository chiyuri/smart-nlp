The participation of scientists, en-\ngineers, and managers from 24 countries reflected the high interest in the use of\nsmall satellites for dedicated missions applied to Earth observation, from scientific\nEarth observation missions to technology demonstration missions. Out of more than\n110 paper submissions in response to the Call for Papers, 54 candidates had the\npossibility to present their papers orally. Thirty-seven participants made use of the\nopportunity to present their paper proposal as a poster.\n\nAs in the preceding symposia, the contributions showed that dedicated Earth\nobservation missions cover a wide range of very different tasks. These missions\nprovide increased opportunities for access to space and can be conducted relatively\nquickly and inexpensively. The spacecraft bus, the instruments, and the ground\nsystems can be based either on optimized off-the-shelf systems with little or no\nrequirements for new technology, or on new high-technology designs. Thus a new\nclass of advanced small satellite missions, including autonomously-operating \u201cin-\ntelligent\u201d satellites and satellite constellations can be created, opening new fields of\napplication for science and the public.\n\nThe symposium provided 11 sessions for oral presentations, one poster session,\none panel discussion and several social events. The panel discussion was dedicated\nto \u201cDevelopment and promotion of integrated applications (space and non-space)\u201d.\nFurthermore, in our 6th Symposium the Student Prize Paper Competition has been\ncontinued. The student papers have been evaluated by distinguished judges selected\nfrom academia, industry and government, coming from four continents. The finalists\npresented their papers in the Student Conference session. With all these events the\nsymposium offered many opportunities for exchanging information, exploring new\nconcepts, and developing new collaborative relationships among individuals and\ninstitutions, industry and academia. These outcomes of the symposium complement\nand reinforce the purpose of the Academy.\n\nAll contributions (oral and poster contributions) of the 6th symposium were pub-\nlished in their short 4-page version in the symposium digest (Small Satellites for\nEarth Observation, Digest of the 6th International Symposium of the International\nAcademy of Astronautics, Berlin, April 23\u201326, 2007, ISBN 3-89685-571-9, 404\n\nv\n\n\n\nvi Preface\n\npages). These selected proceedings contain the orally presented contributions and\nthe awarded best poster presentations the long versions of which have been made\navailable to the editors within a given time frame after the symposium. Due to the\nconversion from color to gray scale when preparing the manuscript for print the\nimage quality has not always proved satisfactory for which we request the reader\u2019s\nunderstanding.\n\nWe would like to thank the members of the Scientific Program Committee and\nthe Program Committee for their active support in organizing the Symposium and\nselecting the papers to be presented orally and as posters, as well as the panel chair\nand panelists who all substantially contributed to the well-perceived program. We\nare also grateful to the session\u2019s chairpersons and rapporteurs. Special thanks go\nto the Symposium and Program Coordinator, Thomas Terzibaschian assisted by\nUte Dombrowski and Karl-Heinz Degen, without whose efforts the organization\nof the symposium and of the proceedings would not have been possible, and to\nthe Symposium Chief Rapporteur, Glen Fountain, who assembled and condensed\nthe summaries provided by each session\u2019s rapporteur into a coherent symposium\nsynopsis.\n\nRainer Sandau\nHans-Peter Ro?ser\n\nArnoldo Valenzuela\n\n\n\nContents\n\nSession 1 Programmatics\n\nNASA Earth Observation Programs and Small Satellites . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3\nSteven P.

Neeck and Theodore F. Hammer\n\nAbstract NASA\u2019s strategic goal in Earth science is motivated by the fundamental\nquestion: \u201cHow is the Earth changing and what are the consequences for life on\nEarth?\u201d NASA\u2019s mission in Earth science as mandated by the U.S. Space Act is to\n\u201c. . . conduct aeronautical and space activities so as to contribute materially to . . . the\nexpansion of human knowledge of the Earth and of phenomena in the atmosphere\nand space\u201d. Therefore, NASA\u2019s role is unique and highly complements those of\nother U.S. Federal agencies by continually advancing Earth system science from\nspace, creating new remote sensing capabilities, and enhancing the operational ca-\npabilities of other agencies and collaborating with them to advance Earth science\ngoals. NASA\u2019s Earth Science Division (ESD) currently has a system of spacecraft\ncollecting observations of the Earth system and in the months and years ahead\nwill deploy new satellites and constellations with advanced measurement capabil-\nities. Small satellites (?500 kg or less) have been crucial contributors to achiev-\ning NASA\u2019s Earth science measurements and will continue to be so in the future.\nThe U.S. National Research Council (NRC) is just now completing its first decadal\nsurvey for Earth science and applications from space. This survey will be used to\nset priorities for future missions to 2017 and beyond. Current status of ESD flight\nprograms, preparations for the NRC decadal survey, and the role of small satellites\nwill be discussed.\n\n1 NASA Earth Science\n\nThe complexity of the Earth system requires that an organized scientific approach be\ndeveloped for addressing the complex, interdisciplinary problems that exist, taking\ngood care that in doing so there is a recognition of the objective to integrate sci-\nence across the programmatic elements towards a comprehensive understanding of\n\nS.P. Neeck\nNASA Headquarters, Science Mission Directorate, Washington, DC 20546, USA\ne-mail: steven.neeck@nasa.gov\n\nT.F. Hammer\nNASA Headquarters, Science Mission Directorate, Washington, DC 20546, USA\n\nR. Sandau et al. (eds.), Small Satellites for Earth Observation, 3\nC\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008\n\n\n\n4 S.P. Neeck and T.F. Hammer\n\nthe Earth system. In the Earth system, these elements may be built around aspects\nof the Earth that emphasize the particular attributes that make it stand out among\nknown planetary bodies. These include the presence of carbon-based life; water in\nmultiple, interacting phases; a fluid atmosphere and ocean that redistribute heat over\nthe planetary surface; an oxidizing and protective atmosphere, albeit one subject to\na wide range of fluctuations in its physical properties (especially temperature, mois-\nture, and winds); a solid but dynamically active surface that makes up a significant\nfraction of the planet\u2019s surface; and an external environment driven by a large and\nvarying star whose magnetic field also serves to shield the Earth from the broader\nastronomical environment.\n\nThe resulting structure is comprised of six interdisciplinary Science Focus Areas:\n\nAtmospheric Composition Weather\nCarbon Cycle and Ecosystems Water and Energy Cycle\nClimate Variability and Change Earth Surface and Interior\n\nThese six focus areas include research that not only addresses challenging sci-\nence questions but drives the development of an Earth observing capability and\nassociated Earth system models as well. In concert with the research community,\nNASA developed a hierarchy of science questions. The fundamental question: \u201cHow\nis the Earth changing and what are the consequences for life on Earth?\u201d leads to five\nassociated core questions, representing a paradigm of variability, forcing, response,\nconsequences and prediction mitigate natural hazards? Figure 1 illustrates the cross-\ncutting and interdisciplinary nature of the science questions and their links to each\nscience focus area.\n\nFig. 1 Links and interrelationships between science focus areas and science questions\n\n\n\nNASA Earth Observation Programs and Small Satellites 5\n\nNASA\u2019s Earth science programs are essential to the implementation of three\nmajor Presidential initiatives: Climate Change Research (June 2001), Global Earth\nObservation (July 2003), and the U.S. Ocean Action Plan (December 2004).\n\nNASA\u2019s Earth science program is an end-to-end one that starts with the develop-\nment of observational techniques and the instrument technology needed to imple-\nment them; tests them in the laboratory and from an appropriate set of suborbital\n(surface, balloon, aircraft) and/or space-based platforms; uses the results to increase\nbasic process knowledge; incorporates results into complex computational models\nthat can be used to more fully characterize the present state and future evolution of\nthe Earth system; and develops partnerships with other national and international\nagencies that can use the generated information in environmental forecasting and in\npolicy and resource management. Accordingly, ESD is divided into the following\nmajor program elements: Research and Analysis, Flight, and Applied Sciences, and\nTechnology [1].\n\n2 ESD Flight Program Status\n\nESD\u2019s Flight Program encompass the space based and suborbital remote sensing ob-\nservational capabilities supporting NASA\u2019s Earth science activities. Ground segment\nelements such as data and information systems are an important part of the Flight\nProgram in addition to space and suborbital missions. Synergy between different\nclasses of observations, basic research, modeling, and data analysis, as well as field\nand laboratory studies is the hallmark of the. Three types of space flight missions\nwere distinguished in the recent past: systematic observation missions (SYSP), ex-\nploratory missions (PI-led), and operational precursor or technology demonstration\nmissions. The identification of these categories represents a significant evolution of\nthe original architecture of the Earth Observing System, which combined studying\nbasic processes, assembling long-term measurement records, and introducing inno-\nvative measurement techniques. The Flight Program also develops geostationary-\norbiting meteorological and polar-orbiting environmental satellites for the National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) through the Geostationary Op-\nerational Environmental Satellite (GOES) and the Polar Operational Environmental\nSatellite (POES) programs.\n\nFigure 2 provides the timeline of Earth science systematic and exploratory mis-\nsions, including placeholders for future missions. 14 ESD missions are currently\noperating while 7 are in formulation or development. Of these 21 missions, 9 fall\ninto the small satellite (?500 kg or less) category. The Ocean Surface Topogra-\nphy Mission (OSTM), Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO), Glory, and Global\nPrecipitation Measurement (GPM) are related upcoming missions. This emphasis\nreflects advancements in compact sensor, small satellite bus, and launch vehicle\ntechnologies, in addition to management innovations (e.g. Principal Investigator\nmission management and streamlined \u201ccatalog\u201d acquisition approaches). Advanced\nplanning suggests this trend will continue including their use in constellations as is\n\n\n\n6 S.P. Neeck and T.F. Hammer\n\nFig. 2 Earth science mission timeline (includes placeholders for future missions)\n\nnow the case in the five satellite A-Train. Descriptions of the four upcoming small\nsatellite missions follow.\n\nOSTM will measure sea surface height to an accuracy of < 4 cm every ten days.\nIts primary objectives are to provide continuity of ocean topography measurements\nbeyond the Jason mission and to provide a bridge to an operational mission to enable\nthe continuation of multi-decadal ocean topography measurements. OSTM uses a\nThales Alenia PROTEUS minisatellite bus. It is a collaboration with CNES, EU-\nMETSAT, and NOAA. OSTM is in implementation (Phase C/D) and is scheduled\nfor 2008 launch with a 3 year lifetime.\n\nOCO provides space-based observations of atmospheric Carbon Dioxide (CO2),\nthe principal human-initiated driver of climate change. It will generate precise\nglobal maps of the abundance of CO2 in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere using an optical\nspectrometer. OCO uses an Orbital Sciences Corporation LeoStar-2 minisatellite\nbus. OCO is in implementation (Phase C/D) and is scheduled for launch in 2008\nwith a 2 year lifetime.\n\nThe Glory mission will increase our understanding of black carbon soot and other\naerosols as causes of climate change as well as continue the measurement of the total\nsolar irradiance. Aerosol properties will be measured by an advanced polarimeter.\nThe total solar irradiance measurement will be made based by a SORCE-heritage\ninstrument. Glory uses an Orbital Sciences Corporation LeoStar minisatellite bus.\nIt will carry two optical instruments. Glory is in implementation (Phase C/D) and is\nscheduled for launch in 2008 with a 3 year lifetime.\n\n\n\nNASA Earth Observation Programs and Small Satellites 7\n\nFig. 3 Ocean Surface\nTopography Mission\n\nFig. 4 Orbiting Carbon\nObservatory\n\nThe Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission initiates the measurement\nof global precipitation, providing uniformly calibrated measurements every 3 hours\nfor scientific research and societal applications through a constellation of dedicated\nand operational satellites carrying active and passive microwave sensors. It is a\ncollaboration with JAXA and other international partners. In addition to the pre-\ncipitation radar carrying Core Spacecraft, NASA supplies a single instrument min-\nisatellite observatory. The GPM Constellation Spacecraft flies in a low-inclination\norbit to improve spatial coverage and sampling frequency, near real-time monitor-\ning and prediction of hurricanes/typhoons, diurnal sampling of precipitation, cross-\ncalibration of polar-orbiting constellation satellites. GPM Constellation will use a\nRSDO catalog minisatellite bus. GPM Constellation is in formulation (Phase B)\nand is scheduled for launch in 2014.\n\n\n\n8 S.P. Neeck and T.F. Hammer\n\nFig. 5 Glory\n\nFig. 6 GPM Constellation\n\n3 NRC Decadal Survey and ESD Preparations\n\nThe U.S. NRC recently completed its first decadal survey for Earth science and ap-\nplications from space [2].This survey will be used by ESD to set priorities for future\nmissions and research and develop an integrated strategic roadmap of its space ac-\ntivities. Among its recommendations, the decadal survey prioritized 15 missions for\nESD to launch during 2010\u20132020. During the latter half of 2006, in preparation for\nthe decadal survey and to facilitate strategic roadmapping, ESD conducted \u201cbuilding\n\n\n\nNASA Earth Observation Programs and Small Satellites 9\n\nblock\u201d mission concept definition studies under NASA Headquarters direction at\nthe Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and the\nLangley Research Center (LaRC). These consisted of 13 individual and 6 integrated\nmission concepts based on earlier Science Focus Area roadmaps. ESD is presently\nusing the engineering, programmatic, and budgetary data from the \u201cbuilding block\u201d\nstudies to construct the priority order of its space science missions through the next\ndecade. In both the decadal survey missions and the ESD \u201cbuilding block\u201d studies\na number of concepts used small satellites in individual or multi-satellite configura-\ntions. Four small satellite concepts from the 15 missions recommended by the NRC\ndecadal survey follow.\n\nThe Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) will\nprovide a global, accurate, and tested climate benchmark. Key observations include\nincident and reflected solar irradiance and spectrally resolved radiance emitted to\nspace that carries the spectral signature of IR forcing of climate and the resulting\nresponse of that climate system. The observing elements are shared between NASA\nand NOAA. The NASA component consists of three microsatellites in polar orbits\nseparated by 60 degrees in orbit plane, two carrying redundant IR interferometers\nand the third carrying in addition a UV/VNIR/SWIR redundant interferometer.\nGPS occultation receivers are carried on all three microsatellites. CLARREO is\nrecommended to launch in the 2010\u20132013 timeframe. The NOAA component of\nCLARREO is the reflight of the TSIS incident solar irradiance and CERES broad-\nband Earth radiation instruments on NPP and NPOESS.\n\nSoil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) will provide global high-resolution\n3\u201310 km soil moisture mapping. It addresses critical science questions in the wa-\nter and energy cycle and enhances the forecasting and mitigation of flash-floods,\nsevere storms, and regional droughts. Additionally, it extends the predictability\nof processes influenced by surface moisture states and fluxes. SMAP is based\non a single minisatellite in low Earth orbit and includes both active and passive\nL band microwave measurements. Its technology readiness benefits from the recent\nHydros risk reduction efforts. SMAP is recommended to launch in the 2010\u20132013\ntimeframe.\n\nSurface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) will address science and applica-\ntions questions related to the storage and movement of inland waters, the circulation\nof the oceans and coastal waters, and the fine-scale bathymetry and roughness of\nthe ocean floor. SWOT carries a Ka band swath altimeter that will produce high\nresolution measurements of water surface elevations over inland waters, as well as\nnear-coastal regions and the open ocean. It also carries a Ku band nadir altimeter, a\nmicrowave radiometer, and a precision GPS receiver. It uses a minisatellite bus and\nis recommended to launch in 2013\u20132016 to overlap with the NOAA-recommended\nocean vector winds mission.\n\nGravity Recovery and Climate Experiment-II (GRACE-II) will measure tempo-\nral variations in Earth\u2019s gravity field at a higher resolution than that demonstrated\nby the NASA-DLR GRACE mission. For the hydrological cycle, GRACE-II will\nobserve large-scale evapotranspiration, soil moisture inventory, and depletion of\nlarge aquifers; detect changes in deep ocean currents to differentiate between sea\n\n\n\n10 S.P. Neeck and T.F. Hammer\n\nFig. 7 CLARREO\n\nFig. 8 SMAP\n\nlevel rise and addition of freshwater from the continents; and detect changes in the\nmass and global spatial distribution of ice and permafrost. In addition, GRACE-II\nwill identify constraints on the strength of Earth\u2019s interior by observing changes\nin the flow in Earth\u2019s core. GRACE-II will have more accurate measurement of\n\n\n\nNASA Earth Observation Programs and Small Satellites 11\n\ninter-satellite range using either an improved version of the GRACE microwave\nranging system or a laser satellite-to-satellite interferometer. The pair of microsatel-\nlites is recommended to be launched in 2016\u20132020.\n\nFig. 9 SWOT\n\nFig. 10 GRACE-II\n\n4 Role of Small Satellites\n\nIn the decade 2007\u20132017, ESD will develop and demonstrate new sensors and\ninteracting constellations of satellites. Expanded operational capabilities will be\ncomplemented with the delivery of reliable data products from the space observ-\ning system and the continual improvement of predictive models based on emerging\nscientific research. In the future, as more data is collected and analyzed from a\nmulti-disciplinary viewpoint and as predictive model development moves toward\nincreased coupling of Earth system components, there will be increasing require-\nments for scientific research. Likewise, the number of space-based observations\nrequired for assimilation into the coupled models will also grow with the complexity\nof the system. In order to meet the increasing demands of data volume and model\ncomplexity, ESD will pursue the following strategies:\n\n? Work with the scientific community to create interdisciplinary teams that help\nfocus research and resources on key uncertainties and model deficiencies;\n\n\n\n12 S.P. Neeck and T.F. Hammer\n\n? Develop in concert with commercial partners, new, decentralized approaches to\ndata archiving and management that emphasizes broad, creative uses of multi-\ndisciplinary data sets;\n\n? Develop, launch and operate a cost effective suite of space-borne missions that\nobserve multiple key Earth system parameters; and,\n\n? Coordinate with other U.S. and international partners to ensure that a core set\nof key measurements are made on a sustained basis.\n\nIn implementing the third of these strategies, ESD anticipates using the increas-\ning capabilities of small satellites and their constellations.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

There was no space-qualified\nmanufacturer in Taiwan before that time. The Government decided to incubate do-\nmestic space-qualified manufacturers in Taiwan through the development of space\nprogram. Consequently, the Government assigned the role of incubating domes-\ntic space-qualified manufacturers to the National Space Organization (NSPO). The\nrole is partly completed after 16 years of effort. Major reasons are that Taiwan\u2019s\nspace budget is small and all manufacturers are commercially oriented. Fortunately\nthere are still some successful examples. This paper reviews the process of incu-\nbating Taiwan\u2019s domestic space-qualified manufacturers through ROCSAT space\nprojects (currently called FORMOSAT projects) and introduces the successful ex-\namples. It then foresees the potential \u201cblue sea\u201d (or say blue ocean) of NSPO\u2019s\nfuture space program. There were three space projects in Taiwan\u2019s first phase\nspace program which spans 15 years from 1991 to 2006: FORMOSAT-1 (FS1),\nFORMOSAT-2 (FS2) and FORMOSAT-3 (FS3). A total of 8 companies had been\nincubated with 23 products manufactured: 5 in FS1, 8 in FS2 and 10 in FS3. Among\nthe 8 incubated companies, 6 continue to participate NSPO\u2019s second phase space\nprogram started at 2004 and shall end in 2018. Simply speaking, NSPO\u2019s experi-\nence can be summarized in two points: (1) it is not easy, and (2) it is a long but\nright way to go. For the potential \u201cblue sea\u201d in the future, NSPO\u2019s is developing the\n\u201csuper cluster project\u201d currently. Tens or hundreds or thousands of cheap microsatel-\nlites called \u201castrochicken\u201d with about 2 years of mission life shall be launched for\nvarious missions. One important point is that they must be very responsive. Under\n\nJ.-S.

There are 3 years of\noverlap. The National Space Program Office (NSPO) of Taiwan was established\nin 1991 to perform the space program. It was then changed to the current name\nNational Space Organization with the same acronym NSPO in 2005. Three satel-\nlite projects had been successfully completed with 8 satellites launched in the first\nphase space program: 1 small satellite in FORMOSAT-1 (FS1) project, 1 small\nsatellite in FORMOSAT-2 (FS2) project, and 6 micro satellite as a constellation\nin FORMOSAT-3 (FS3) project.\n\nOne of the major roles of Taiwan\u2019s space program is to incubate the domes-\ntic space-qualified manufacturers. Therefore, from the beginning NSPO adopted a\nstrategic policy to construct some satellite components by domestic manufacturers\nin order to build up space industry in Taiwan. A few carefully selected manufactur-\ners obtained technology transfer agreements of space-qualified satellite components\nfrom foreign manufacturers. Using the transferred technical know-how, these man-\nufacturers were able to fabricate some spacecraft components for FS1, FS2 and FS3\nprojects, respectively.\n\nThis paper introduces the domestic space-qualified manufacturers incubated and\ntheir products. [1] Then the super cluster concept for NSPO\u2019s future blue sea policy\nis presented.\n\n2 Space-Qualified Manufacturers Incubated in FS1 Project [1]\n\nThe FS1 project was started in 1994 and completed in 1998. This is a cooperation\nproject between NSPO and TRW of US for developing a small scientific satellite.\nFour domestic space-qualified manufacturers had been incubated with 5 products\nprovided.\n\n2.1 Acer Incorporation\n\nAcer Incorporation built the on-board computer (OBC) to handle the satellite oper-\nation.

It is a cooperation\nproject with OSC of US for the development of 6 microsatellites to form a con-\nstellation observing system for meteorology, ionosphere and climate (COSMIC).\nTherefore, the whole system is known as FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC internationally.\nTo further promote the domestic manufacturers\u2019 participation in the space industry\nand to solidify Taiwan\u2019s space industry development, NSPO incorporated 5 domes-\ntic manufacturers to produce 14 modules and components for FS3.\n\n4.1 Acer Incorporation\n\nAcer Incorporation manufactured the OBC of FS3 for the major function of satellite\noperation control, including data and signal processing, command interpretation and\nexecution, and other secondary system interface control.

Among them, TAC had been closed at about 5 years ago\ndue to policy change of the company. All the others keep participating NSPO\u2019s cur-\nrent space projects except Trans System Incorporation. However, we can only say\nthat a few space-qualified manufacturers have been successfully incubated. There\nis still no real space industry in Taiwan. The reason is simply because that the\npercentage of the space product value is negligibly small in the whole industrial\ncommunity. Consequently, NSPO is seeking a possible breakthrough in Taiwan\u2019s\nsecond phase space program which already started in 2004.\n\n6 NSPO\u2019S Future Development Concept\u2013Super Cluster\nof Microsatellites\n\n6.1 Insights of Freeman Dyson [2]\n\nIn his book, Freeman Dyson mentioned that in order to control the price of a new gener-\nation spacecraft to be within several tens thousands US dollars, we need to develop the\ntechnologies far more advanced beyond 1988. The spacecraft must be cheaper, lighter\nand simpler. Further, the weight of the spacecraft should be in the order of pounds\n\n\n\nIncubating Domestic Space-Qualified Manufacturers Through ROCSAT Programs 23\n\ninstead of tons. Also, each spacecraft could have several missions everyday instead\nof every year. There are two ways to reach the achievement: \u201cnano- technology\u201d and\n\u201cgenetic engineering\u201d. Three paragraphs from his book are quoted bellow:\n\n\u201cI have sketched in a rough fashion how space-technology jumped in the past\nthirty years, from 1958 to 1988. The von Braun Mars Project represented the tech-\nnology of 1958. The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) represented the tech-\nnology of 1988. The Mars Project was the best you could have done with space\nexploration in 1958, while the IUE was the best you could do in 1988. The point of\nthis comparison is that the jump in cost-effectiveness from the Mars Project to the\nIUE is not just a factor of 10 or 100 but more like a factor of 10,000 or 100,000.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we look forward to 2018 (e.g., thirty years from 1988), we should ex-\npect big steps forward in science to come once again from changes in style rather\nthan from marginal improvements in technology. I am saying that another jump\nby a factor of ten thousand in cost-effectiveness is possible. . . . To improve cost-\neffectiveness by a factor of ten thousand, we need spacecraft that are radically\ncheaper, smaller, and quicker than anything we can build with 1988 technology.\nSpacecraft should weigh pounds rather than tons, they should cost tens of thousands\nrather than tens of millionsof dollars, and they should fly missions at a rate of sev-\neral per day rather than several per year. . . . Both mechanical nanotechnology and\ngenetic engineering are vigorously growing industries, and are likely to be trans-\nforming our Earth-bound economy during the next thirty years.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is a rough sketch of one possible shape that the 2018 spacecraft might take.\nI call this model astrochicken because it is about as big as a chicken and about as\nsmart. It is a product of genetic engineering. It does not look like a chicken. It looks\nmore like a butterfly. . . .\u201d Coincidently, the shape of FS3 microsatellite is just like a\nbutterfly, as shown in Fig. 12.\n\nFig. 12 FS3 microsatellite (6\nas a constellation)\n\n6.2 \u201cBlue Sea\u201d Policy\n\nThrough the analysis of the strengths of Taiwan industrial community, one very im-\nportant point is the strength in the area of semiconductor, computer and information\n\n\n\n24 J.-S. Chern et al.\n\ntechnology (IT). On the other hand, two of the weaknesses of NSPO are that both the\nscale of Taiwan space program and the number of satellite projects are too small. It\nis very obvious that the current space community is a \u201cred sea\u201d (or say, red ocean)\ndominated by NASA of USA, ESA of European Countries, JAXA of Japan, China\nNational Space Administration (CNSA) of China, ISRO of India, etc. Within this\nenvironment and with the two weakness points, NSPO needs to find its way to go\nahead and possibly to win in the future. Consequently, it is necessary for NSPO to\nseek the \u201cblue sea\u201d (or say blue ocean) policy on how to use the Taiwan\u2019s strength in\nIT. [3, 4] The astrochicken could be one of the ways NSPO can choose. Under the idea\nof astrochicken, tens or hundreds or even thousands of microsatellites shall be flying\nin the orbit or even in the interplanetary space. Taiwan can apply the similar road map\nof its IT industry in the development and mass production of microsatellites.\n\n6.3 Super Cluster Concept\n\nThe tens or hundreds or thousands of microsatellites flying in the orbit and the in-\nterplanetary space shall form a kind of constellation. We call it the \u201cSuper Cluster\u201d\ntemporarily. As long as the microsatellites are so cheap, no high reliability is re-\nquired. Whenever needed, new satellites can be assembled and launched within a\nshort time. [5, 6] These astrochickens can communicate with the ground stations\nand also among themselves. The ground stations shall be very powerful so that they\ncan do the job of coordination, tracking, telemetry, command, and data processing.\nBoth image and scientific data shall be collected. Since 2006, NSPO has started the\npreliminary study phase of this project.\n\n7 Summary and Conclusions\n\nIncubating Taiwan\u2019s domestic space-qualified manufacturers was the Government\u2019s\npolicy since the first phase space program started at 1991. Four manufacturers made\n5 products for the FORMOSAT-1 (FS1), 6 manufacturers made 8 products for the\nFORMOSAT-2 (FS2), and 5 manufacturers made 10 products for the FORMOSAT-\n3 (FS3). A total of 8 domestic space-qualified manufacturers had been incubated\nand 6 of them continue to participate NSPO\u2019s current second phase space program\nwhich spans from 2004 to 2018. Therefore, it can be concluded that the way is\nnot easy although it is right. In order to conquer the difficulty, NSPO started to\ndevelop the super cluster project at 2006. This policy has been made after analyzing\nNSPO\u2019s weakness points and Taiwan\u2019s strength in computer industry. It is expected\nthat tens or hundreds or thousands of cheap astrochicken microsatellites capable of\ndoing various missions with reasonable mission life and reliability can be launched\nresponsively in the future. Complicated command and coordination work shall be\naccomplished by the ground system. Also, the new image processing system and\nscientific data processing system shall be developed to satisfy the tremendous data\nprocessing requirement.\n\n\n\nIncubating Domestic Space-Qualified Manufacturers Through ROCSAT Programs 25\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Sandau et al.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nSince the advent of modern technologies, small satellites using off-the-shelf tech-\nnologies or missions focused on specific physical phenomena have also been per-\nceived to offer an opportunity for countries with a modest research budget and little\nor no experience in space technology, to enter the field of space-borne Earth observa-\ntion and its applications. This is very much in line with the charter of the IAA Study\nGroup on Small Satellite Missions for Earth Observation. One of its intentions is\nto bring within the reach of every country the opportunity to operate small satellite\nEarth observation missions and utilize the data effectively at low costs, as well as to\ndevelop and build application-driven missions. In this context the study group sup-\nports all activities to develop and promote concepts and processes by various user\ncommunities to conduct or participate in Earth observation missions using small,\neconomical satellites, and associated launches, ground stations, data distributions\nstructures, and space system management approaches.\n\nGenerally, the study [1, 2] provides a definition of cost-effective Earth observa-\ntion missions, information about background material and organizational support,\nshows the cost drivers and how to achieve cost-effective missions, and provides\na chapter dedicated to training and education. The focus is on the status quo and\nprospects of applications in the field of Earth observation. The conclusions and\nrecommendations of the study are the focus of this paper. They are summarized\nhere in terms of\n\n? more general facts that drive the small satellite mission activities,\n? recommendations of the study\n? trends in Earth observation missions, and\n? some visions concerning the future of cost-effective Earth observation missions.\n\n2 Conclusions and Recommendations of the IAA Study\n\nThe study presented the state of the art of small satellite missions and examined the\nfactors that enable one to produce a cost-effective small satellite mission for Earth\nobservation. We find that, while there are several examples of such missions flying\ntoday, the lessons that must be learned in order to produce cost-effective small sat\nmissions have neither been universally accepted nor understood by all in the space\ncommunity. In the study we intended to point out how a potential user can produce a\ncost effective mission. One of the key enablers of designing a cost-effective mission is\nhaving the key expertise available. As the number of successfully space-faring nations\ngrows, the pool of expertise available to meet the challenges of small mission grows.\n\n2.1 General Facts\n\nCost-effective missions can be achieved by using different approaches and methods.\n\n\n\nTrends and Visions for Small Satellite Missions 29\n\nSince the advent of modern technologies, small satellites have also been perceived\nto offer an opportunity for countries with a modest research budget and little or no\nexperience in space technology, to enter the field of space-borne Earth observation\nand its applications.\n\nOne of the possible approaches is to take full advantage of the ongoing technol-\nogy developments leading to further miniaturization of engineering components,\ndevelopment of micro-technologies for sensors and instruments which allow to\ndesign dedicated, well-focused Earth observation missions. At the extreme end of\nthe miniaturization, the integration of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)\nwith microelectronics for data processing, signal conditioning, power conditioning,\nand communications leads to the concept of application specific integrated micro-\ninstruments (ASIM). These micro- and nano-technologies have led to the concepts\nof nano- and pico-satellites, constructed by stacking wafer-scale ASIMs together\nwith solar cells and antennas on the exterior surface, enabling the concept of space\nsensor webs.\n\nMore generally small satellite missions are supported by four contemporary\ntrends:\n\n? advances in electronic miniaturization and associated performance capability;\n? the recent appearance on the market of new small launchers (e.g. through the use\n\nof modified military missiles to launch small satellites);\n? the possibility of \u201cindependence\u201d in space (small satellites can provide an af-\n\nfordable way for many countries to achieve Earth Observation and/or defense\ncapability, without relying on inputs from the major space-faring nations);\n\n? ongoing reduction in mission complexity as well as in those costs associated with\nmanagement; with meeting safety regulations etc.\n\nThese trends are complemented by\n\n? the development of small ground station networks connected with rapid and cost-\neffective data distribution methods\n\n? and cost-effective management and quality assurance procedures\n\nThe advantages of small satellite missions are:\n\n? more frequent mission opportunities and therefore faster return of science and\napplication data\n\n? larger variety of missions and therefore also greater diversification of potential\nusers\n\n? faster expansion of the technical and/or scientific knowledge base\n? greater involvement of local and small industry.\n\nAfter some years of global experience in developing low cost or cost-effective\nEarth observation missions, one may break down the missions into general cate-\ngories such as:\n\n? Commercial \u2013 requiring a profit to be made from satellite data or services\n? Scientific/Military \u2013 requiring that new scientific/military data to be obtained\n\n\n\n30 R. Sandau et al.\n\n? New technology \u2013 developing or demonstrating a new level of technology\n? Competency demonstration \u2013 developing and demonstrating a space systems\n\ncompetency\n? Space technology transfer/training \u2013 development of an organic capability\n? Engineering competency growth \u2013 developing engineering competence using\n\nspace as a motivation\n? Education \u2013 personal growth of students via course projects or project team\n\nparticipation\n\nIn the study we find that large and small satellite missions are complementary\nrather than competitive. The large satellite missions are sometimes even a precondi-\ntion for cost-effective small satellite solutions.\n\n2.2 Some Recommendations and Observations from the Study\n\nThe situation in the field of small satellite missions for Earth observation has ma-\ntured in the last ten years. This may be, for instance, observed from the topics and\nthe quality of contributions to the series of, to date, five biannual IAA Symposia\non Small Satellites for Earth Observation in Berlin, Germany. The 5th Symposium\ntook place in April, 2005.\n\nWe propose a simplified nomenclature for subsets of small satellites:\n\n\u2022 mini satellites <1000 kg\n\u2022 micro satellites <100 kg\n\u2022 nano satellites <10 kg\n\u2022 pico satellites <1 kg\n\nAdditionally, the cost and duration from the decision for a mission to getting\nthe satellite into the orbit usually decrease with decreasing satellite complexity\nand mass.\n\nThere is no single, accepted, broad method for reducing mission cost. Instead, the\nbuilders of low-cost missions are aggressive competitors, just like their more expen-\nsive colleagues who create large programs for ESA, NASA, or the US Department\nof Defence. Each low-cost program has found and have to find a set of solutions\nto fill its particular need and programmatic style. The full paper gives a summary\nof cost reduction methods which are selectively used by the builders of low-cost\nmissions.\n\nTo reduce cost, alternatives to dedicated launches of satellites should also be\ntaken into consideration. Although each of the alternatives given and explained in\nthe full paper has limitations, dramatic reductions in cost are possible for missions\nsuch as equipment testing that do not necessarily need a long period on orbit.\n\nCost-effectiveness also depends on the quality and engagement of the spe-\ncialists participating in planning and implementing an Earth observation mission.\nCountries taking their first steps in space need to learn relevant techniques from\nmore experienced space users, thereby acquiring a cadre of appropriately trained\n\n\n\nTrends and Visions for Small Satellite Missions 31\n\npersonnel before going on to establish a national agency and to maintain a pres-\nence in space. Technology transfer through small satellite related training programs\nhas been successfully implemented between Surrey University in the U.K. and cus-\ntomers in Chile, Malaysia, Pakistan, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, South Africa\nand Thailand.\n\nSmall satellites programs provide a natural means for the education and training\nof scientists and engineers in space related skills since they allow direct, hands-on,\nexperience at all stages (technical and managerial) of a particular mission (including\ndesign, production, test, launch and orbital operations).\n\n3 Some Trends in Earth Observation Missions\n\nDifferent Earth observation applications need different approaches for cost-effective\nmissions. The individual prospects are shown in chapter \u201cApplication Fields, Status\nQuo and Prospects\u201d. The general prospects for disaster warning and support may\nserve as an example for the trends in Earth observation missions. They can be\ngrouped into the following main topics: space, ground, and program segment.\n\n3.1 Trends in the Space Segment\n\nThe trends of technology development in the space segment relevant for disaster\nmanagement are characterized by:\n\n?

Some key points are:\n\n? tele-medicine applications are important for disaster management and should be\nextended,\n\n? medical weather maps should be integrated into public health applications,\n? tele-education should be built up for disaster applications,\n? national disaster preparedness should be improved and should include the appro-\n\npriate use of the space segment,\n? new monitoring applications using space technologies (GPS) should be applied\n\nto rescue teams and people in high risk areas,\n? integration of space-based sensors into the spectrum of sensors that includes\n\nground- and aircraft-based systems,\n? use of new airborne platforms such as UAVs (Unmanned Air Vehicle) or trans-\n\nportable tethered balloons or dirigible airships may augment the space segment,\n? integration and fusion of data from all available sources and the development of\n\nmodels related to disaster conditions are progressing to the point where expert\nsystems may become available\n\n? multi-temporal analysis of regional changes and conditions based on already\nexisting satellite data is currently done by experts and must be simplified or\nimproved to address a broader potential user community\n\nIn summary, tele-health and tele-education applications should be included in a\ndisaster monitoring program. In addition, the entire spectrum of assets, from ground\nto space, must be integrated into an environment that provides the information\nneeded to make decisions. This \u201cexpert system\u201d needs to be developed: too much of\nthe data is of meaning to, and accessible, only to experts and too little is in a form\nthat can be used for disaster relief and mitigation personnel.\n\n4 The Future of Cost-Effective Earth Observation Missions\n\nIn the study we have considered the past experience of the global small satellite\ncommunity and reviewed and incorporated the work of other studies and bodies that\ndeal with disseminating information about small satellite missions and in promoting\nthe appropriate use of such technology and we have surveyed the state of our current\n\n\n\n36 R. Sandau et al.\n\nknowledge. The study brings to light new capabilities as well as challenges that must\nbe addressed in order to produce successful, cost-effective small satellite missions.\n\n4.1 New Capabilities\n\nThere are three new developments that may prove to greatly enhance the capabilities\nof small satellite missions. These are:\n\n1. the convergence of data acquisition and data visualization technologies\n2. the ready availability of new small launchers and the rise of \u201cspace tourism\u201d\n3. the development of smaller, lighter, lower power satellites that can act as a con-\n\nstellation or independently\n\nWhile there are many other developing technologies that hold promise, these\nfactors may well transform the small satellite enterprise in the next ten years. A\nmission can be cost-effective and achieve all its measurement requirements without\nhaving to actually make all the measurements itself. To put this in concrete terms,\nNASA has a series of research satellites (Aqua, CloudSat, CALIPSO, PARASOL,\nAura, and OCO) called the \u201cA Train\u201d that fly in formation. These satellites make in-\ndividual measurements that support cross platform science. Many of the instruments\nthat image the surface also use ancillary information, such as digital elevation maps,\nto add context to their products. One could readily envision a small satellite mission\nthat was intended to provide some niche product, such as crop yield forecasting, in a\nparticular region. Such a small satellite could produce a very specific measurement,\nsay normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), which would be corrected for\naerosols and clouds using data from the A Train. Another approach, as evidenced in\nSSTL\u2019s DMC, is to decrease the ground repeat delay by forming a cooperative that\nshares data which are produced among the elements of the constellation. Member-\nship is acquired by contracting for the production of an element of the constellation.\nEach member of the cooperative then gets the benefit of a much shorter revisit\ntime. In short, the economies of scale begin to operate as more members join the\ncooperative.\n\nGetting into space is still a challenge. During the last ten years there have been\nmore small launchers available and at prices that are quite reasonable compared\nto the cost of a small satellite. One of the newest and, potentially, most vigor-\nous areas of development of small launchers has come about under the impetus\nof \u201cspace tourism\u201d. On October 4th, 2004, Burt Rutan and Paul Allen, built and\nflew the world\u2019s first private spacecraft to the edge of space to win the $10 mil-\nlion Ansari X Prize. Perhaps the early history of the development of commercial\naviation presages the next twenty years of space access. At the turn of the century,\nair travel was relatively risky and quite expensive. As the commercial market for\nair transport grew, costs dropped as did risk. Now, air transport is so cost-effective\nthat it is used to ship bulky agricultural goods, such as apples, half-way around\nthe world at prices that are competitive with local transport and production. To\nmake space tourism viable the cost of putting a person in space will have to be\n\n\n\nTrends and Visions for Small Satellite Missions 37\n\nreduced to of the order of $1M. At those kinds of costs for mass to orbit, small\nsatellite missions will no longer be strongly constrained by launch costs. If we step\nback from the purely speculative, commercial launch services are now available\non most launch systems, many of which are new vehicles designed or modified\nspecifically for international commercial market. The most dramatic shift has been\nthe entry of the Russian and Ukrainian launch systems operated as joint ventures\nwith US or European companies. New launch systems around the world are even\nbeginning to use major components built in other countries, further blurring national\ndivisions. This international trend is important because some nations still insist on\nthe use of a \u201cnational\u201d launch capability. The increasing availability of these low-\ncost launchers and the development of dispensers has opened up possibilities for\nsingle launches of a constellation as well as individual payloads. The launch of the\nNASA / DLR GRACE satellites used Eurockot Launch Services, the joint venture\nowned by Astrium and the Russian company Khrunichev, to place two satellites\nin a closely controlled formation via a dispenser is a good example. This launch\nwas the first commercial use of the Russian SS-19 ICBM which provides the two\nbooster stages for the ROCKOT launch vehicle. This vehicle has a heritage of 150\nflights. At the other end of the cost and mass spectrum, Ariane 5 has been used to\nlaunch 6 auxiliary payloads along with the primary Helios satellite. This included\nNanosat, Spain\u2019s first small satellite, built by the country\u2019s INTA national space\nagency (Instituto Nacional de Te?cnia Aeroespacial), with a mass of less than 20 kg.\nIn another example, the Cluster mission formed a constellation of four satellites,\nflying in formation, using two separate launches.\n\nOnce the spacecraft are in orbit, the remaining costs are largely associated with\noperating the spacecraft (including monitoring its health and safety) and collecting\nthe data. As the number of spacecraft increases in a constellation there would be,\nwithout a change in the operations paradigm, a concomitant increase in the costs to\noperate the constellation. In order to have a cost effective constellation of micro-\nor nano-satellites, the operations costs have to be low on a per satellite basis, espe-\ncially since some of these constellations are envisioned as consisting of tens or even\nhundreds of micro- or nano-satellites. Powerful, cheap, microprocessors provide the\nmeans for increased autonomy at the individual satellite level and across the constel-\nlation. At issue, though, is developing the software to perform these operations and\nsubsequently testing the software so that its operation can be verified before flight.\nQualifying these systems for spaceflight will be a challenge that must be addressed.\n\n4.2 Challenges\n\nThe biggest long-term challenge for the small satellite community is that of develop-\ning a robust commercial market that supports the infrastructure that has been devel-\noped to produce small satellites. Small satellites have appealed to some nations as an\ninstrument of national pride and as a means to focus and enhance the industrial base\nas well as providing a means of attracting students to a high tech industry. This is, of\ncourse, a finite market. After the first few satellites there has to be reason other than\n\n\n\n38 R. Sandau et al.\n\nbecoming a space-faring nation to invest in, develop, and fly the next space mission\nand continue the development and training of students. To develop a robust market,\nsmall satellite manufacturers must remain relevant and cost-effective. It appears that\nin many markets space technology has entered the era of diminishing returns \u2013 for\nexample, if you can achieve imagery from space with a spatial resolution of about\none meter, do you really gain anything marketable by imaging at one centimeter?\nThis plateau effect means that more vendors can aspire to provide the same product.\nHow many suppliers can the market support? It may be that the market can support\nmore suppliers of imagery if revisit time is a key driver. The user then must draw\nproducts from several sources and understand enough about each independent data\nsource so that the desired product can be produced. Raw data products, though,\nare not likely to capture many more users: tailored products that address specific\nneeds can be supplied by small satellites. The vertical integration of the industry, to\nprovide instruments, data and integrated data products, is likely to spur significant\ngrowth.\n\nUntil that robust commercial market has been developed, government support\nwill continue to be the financial mainstay of the small satellite community. This\nsituation will remain in force until some economies of scale can be achieved. At this\ntime, SSTL and RapidEye are two notable examples of commercial ventures that\nhave achieved some stability. They did this by identifying and cultivating a niche\nmarket that they are able to address. Much of the small satellite community is still\ntied to education and research activities \u2013 activities that rely on government support.\nInter-government cooperative agreements provide the means of broadening the op-\nportunities available to the community. Bureaucracies are averse to risk, however,\nand small organizations and cooperative agreements are often viewed as risky.\n\nManaging risk is a key problem, then. Since no complex system can be designed\nand tested against all failure modes, experience is often the best and only guide to\nmaking trades. Large organizations tend to have more restrictions on what can fly\nand may have stringent risk assessment processes. In NASA terms the confidence\nin a subsystem or system is called the Technology Readiness Level or TRL of the\nitem. Higher TRLs mean the element has significant flight experience. The highest\nTRL is assigned to elements with direct flight heritage. Small satellites can be quite\neffective as platforms to raise the TRL of an element to be used in a latter design.\nThe challenge faced by the small satellite community is to gain a broader acceptance\nof the notion that TRLs can be raised as an integral part of a mission rather than by\nimplementing a dedicated mission such as the JPL-led Deep Space missions.\n\nMaking small satellites more cost-effective calls for new technologies but who\nthen pays to certify these new technologies for spaceflight? There is certainly a\nhigher risk associated with unproven technology. For example, the ready availabil-\nity of large format detectors at relatively low cost shifts the design choices from\nbeing driven by the detector resolution to being driven by other factors such as the\ninterplay between spacecraft stability and off-nadir pointing capability or downlink\nbandwidth and onboard storage, etc. Can a system be designed that can use these\nnew detectors? How do they behave in space? A small mission is arguably the best\nway to perform a flight verification because even a failure to operate on orbit, or\neven to achieve orbit, can still be a successful demonstration from an educational or\n\n\n\nTrends and Visions for Small Satellite Missions 39\n\ndevelopmental viewpoint. Cost-sharing between a larger, richer, risk-averse partner\nand a smaller, poorer, more risk-tolerant partner may prove beneficial to both parties.\n\n4.3 Success and Failure of Cost-effective Missions\n\nThe study examined both what we know about small satellites and their uses for\nEarth observation. What makes a mission cost effective? The simplest answer is\nthat the desired end is achieved for a price that is acceptable to all parties. While\nsome mission objectives may only be achieved by the large, complex instruments\nand spacecraft, there are many uses for small missions. For many potential cus-\ntomers the best price point is established by sharing risk. If the risk is borne broadly,\neven a failure to achieve launch can still yield a cost-effective mission because the\npartners view the educational and infrastructure return as sufficiently high and the\nother shared aspects of the partnership yield some of the required information. To\nremain cost-effective in the commercial arena, small missions must be able to incor-\nporate new technologies that reduce costs and improve performance. Small satellite\nmissions face growing competition in regional markets from GPS-based solutions,\nUAVs, balloons, and sensor webs, for example. The chief advantage of satellites is\ntheir global access. Exploiting that, and successfully marketing that advantage, will\nhold the long-term key to keeping small satellites cost-effective.\n\nAssessing whether a mission is successful or not involves many different mea-\nsures. Assuring that a small-satellite mission is considered successful means that\nthese differing measures must be addressed and considered in the design of the\nmission. Some of these measures of success are, in fact, much more likely to be\nfulfilled by a small-satellite mission than a large one. For example, students are\nmuch more likely to be involved in a small satellite mission. The experience gained\nin the design, construction, test, flight, operation, and data analysis phase of the mis-\nsion will guarantee \u201csuccess\u201d in terms of the educational experience of the students.\nSmall satellites can demonstrate new technologies or measurement techniques. If\nthey achieve these goals they are \u201csuccessful\u201d even if the scope of the goal is small\n(for example, a small satellite mission need not inventory the global carbon budget\nbut it could provide a measure of the amount of carbon produced in boreal forest\nfires). In terms of impact at the national level, a small satellite that is produced by\na country may well evoke more pride of ownership than an instrument or partici-\npation in a large-scale investigation. In this study we have laid out the reasons how\nto design and implement a small cost-effective Earth-observation mission. In the\nend, success is subjective: the true measure is whether the program continues and\nflourishes.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

At this\nmoment we are running the Phase-B started in Nov. 06 that will finish with a PDR\nin Dec. 07. The first INTA?SAT-1 will be a very agile Earth observation mission\nusing CMGs, with a launch tentative date by the beginning of 2010. This enlarged\n?SAT class is a further step after the NANOSAT programme success [1] with a\nlaunch onboard Ariane-5 V-165 in Dec. 04 (Nanosat-01 still working OK in orbit),\nand the next Nanosat-1B planned to be launched most probably in a DNEPR by\nthe middle of 2008. It will be followed by Nanosat-2, an evolved 15\u201340 Kg satellite\nwith improved service module resources and a separated payload module design,\nset for launch by 2011.\n\nMain objectives of the INTA?SAT initiative are similar to the NANOSAT pro-\ngramme: 1-Keep running at our Institute an internal space programme with limited\nresources; 2-Most of the subsystems are developed at INTA, but with collabora-\ntions in the research and bilateral work with several universities and other research\n\nM.

At the same time,\nwe try to offer parts of HW or SW to the small business Spanish industries, to\npromote and encourage their entering into the space technology.\n\nThe launch of the first Nanosat-01 mission was made on 18 Dec. 04 by an Ariane-5\nASAP from Kourou. Next sister Nanosat-01B with the same store & forward commu-\nnication mission and an enhanced UHF antenna, is planned to be launched in 2008.\n\n2 Roots and Logic of the INTA?SAT Programme\n\nMINISAT, a well focused 150\u2013250 Kg small satellite programme started in 1989,\nwas in fact a precursor of the actual success on this s/c category, but unfortunately\nit was stopped after the first mission launch in 1997. Even after almost 5 years\nworking perfectly in orbit that gave remarkable science returns, this was the second\ndeceleration after Intasat 1st generation 15 years stop from 1974 to 1989. At the time\nof Minisat-01, a joint development effort with the \u201cbig\u201d national space industries\nwas the right approach for a minisatellite mission in Spain.\n\nFortunately and in order not to stop the space mission\u2019s activity in our Institute,\nthe much smaller Nanosat programme started at the right moment (1998) little after\nMinisat-01 launch. This time it was focused to an almost internal R&D initiative\nat INTA, based mainly in our own human and facilities resources. The National\nSpace Plan founded partially the Phases A & B studies to all the participant in-\nstitutions (universities and other research centres). Phases C/D, launch campaign\nand the actual in orbit operations, have been fully founded by our INTA internal\nbudget.\n\n2.1 Why not a Bigger INTA?SAT?\n\nJust as a logical further step to the original Nanosat initiative, in Oct. 05 we started\nthe INTA?SAT programme Phase-A feasibility study, to take full advantage of\n\n\n\nDevelopment of the MicroSat Programme at INTA 43\n\nFig. 1 The INTASAT satellite (1974)\n\nthe Ariane-5 launch using ASAP. In our view and considering the evolved space\nindustry reality in Spain today, we can state that the same approach is also applica-\nble to a microsatellite programme. This class now is going up to 150 Kg total mass\ndue to the actual Ariane-5 ASAP bigger size, compared with the previous 50 Kg\ncapability of the Ariane-4 ASAP. However, the MicroSat missions can be adapted\nto a bigger mass (<200 Kg) or different small launchers.\n\n3 Programme Support Team: Universities, National Research\nInstitutes, and Small Business Spanish Industries\n\nTo fully develop a small satellite project internally is not an easy task at INTA,\neven having the resources of 1400 people and very capable test facilities, be-\ncause it is very difficult to cover all the necessary disciplines. Besides that, other\n\n\n\n44 M.

Next team members are contributing\ntill now:\n\n? SRG-UAH: the Space Research Group belongs to the Universidad de Alcala?\nnear Madrid. They started with space activities on the Payload processor for an\ninstrument on board SOHO. During the development phase of Nanosat-01 they\nwere responsible for the on board and EGSE SW. Now they are also working with\nINTA in the design & development of the OBDH processor for the INTA?SAT\nService Module (SVM).\n\n? RM-EUITA-UPM: the Structural Group at the Escuela Universitaria de Inge-\nnieros Te?cnicos Aerona?uticos belongs to the Universidad Polite?cnica de Madrid\n(UPM), was responsible for the Nanosat-01 structure NASTRAN analysis. Now\nthey are doing the same job for INTA?SAT satellite.\n\n? UCM: The Automatic Control Research Group form the Universidad Com-\nplutense de Madrid, have previous experience in control laws design and imple-\nmentation. They are integrated in the AOCS design & testing group, with INTA\nas leader.\n\n? AD Telecom: is a small private company in Barcelona that was responsible of\nthe UHF transceiver (20 Kbps) development. Now they are working on a new\nS-Band transceiver with 2 Mbps capability, for INTA?SAT TTC and payload\ntelemetry.\n\n? TTI Norte: is another little company in Santander, which was responsible of the\nspecific communications protocol develop-ment for Nanosat-01. They are now\ndeveloping the INTA?SAT TTC protocol, that is compatible to ESA CCSDS\nrecommendations.\n\n? DEIMOS: is a well known private Spanish small company in the GN&C ac-\ntivities for ESA and other European programmes. Within INTA?SAT they are\nparticipating in the mission analysis and supporting the AOCS design and testing\ngroup.\n\n4 Microsat System Approach\n\nINTA?SAT is focused at a multimission system optimised for 600\u2013700 Km LEO or-\nbits, with inclinations ranging from 0? to 100?. The satellite design is modular with\na neat physical separation between the Service Module (SVM) and Payload Module\n(PLM), that will easy the design and integration phases for different payloads (P/L)\nin parallel with the SVM. The subsystems (S/S) design philosophy is also modular\nto allow specific resources to be matched to each particular mission, most prob-\nably with different flight configurations. The AOCS should cope with Earth, Sun\nand Space Pointing, from 1? to few arc seconds. The baseline design is with fixed\nsolar panels, but a design rotating along Xs axis is available if specifically required.\nPropulsion will be an add-on module when needed.\n\n\n\n46 M. Angulo et al.\n\nInner H\nstructural\n\npanels\n\nPayload\navailable\nvolume\n(50 %) \n\n4 Fixed\nsolar\n\npanels\n\nLower plate\n(launcher I / F) 4 External SVM\n\nstructural panels\nSVM\nUnits\n\nFig. 4 MicroSat exploded view\n\nThere are 6 S/S: Structure, thermal control, Communications, AOCS, OBDH\n(HW & SW) and Power. Next Fig. 5 provides the block diagrams for a generic\nSVM and the PLM. Each mission is particular in its design or configuration, and the\nblocks will change in accordance with the needs.\n\n4.1 Units Design\n\nThe volume available inside a Nano or ?SAT is typically much reduced and for\nthis reason, it was decided after a trade-off study for Nanosat-01 also applicable\nto the MicroSat SVM, to have several quite small electronic boxes instead of big\nones. This approach gives much more flexibility for accommodation, and optimises\nthe volume occupation. Figure 6 shows as an example the Nanosat-01 PDU four\nlevel boards and mother board (total mass is 1,4 Kg). To improve the modularity,\nwe selected a common and small board size for most satellite units: single Europe\n100 \u00d7 160 mm. Due to the increased capabilities and power consumption reasons,\nin some INTA?SAT units we need also double size: 200 \u00d7 160 mm. This applies\nto the OBDH box and Power Distribution Unit (PDU), with total masses around\n\n\n\nDevelopment of the MicroSat Programme at INTA 47\n\nFig. 5 SVM & PLM block diagrams\n\n2,5 Kg per unit. When required by a specific box, a common back plane design is\nalso available to interconnect the different boards inside that particular unit.\n\n4.2 Models Philosophy\n\nAfter a full development of all units and subsystems that must be reused in other\nNano or ?SAT missions, it was difficult to establish a simplified baseline model\nphilosophy. For new electronics unit level we use: EBB, EM, QM and FM. For\nlimited redesigns we go directly to PFM after delta qualifications. There are some\napplications \u2013typically for experiments-were we decide EQM & PFM. Nevertheless,\nwe usually apply important simplifications:\n\n\n\n48 M. Angulo et al.\n\nFig. 6 Power Distribution Unit \u2013 PDU for Nanosat-01 (similar for INTA?SAT)\n\n1. The EM units are submitted to a temperature cycle at ambient pressure, to check\nthe behaviour of the design at the limits.\n\n2. The QM units are not fully qualified isolated (thermal vacuum, shock & vibration\ntests), but all interconnected at system level with the satellite QM harness, not\nyet assembled in the s/c (see Fig. 7).\n\nFig. 7 All Nanosat-01 QM units with the s/c harness at the TV test at system level\n\n3. After the required functional test, the Flight units passed just the environmental\nacceptance tests at satellite level.\n\nFor the satellite level we usually build STM, QM and FM. Here again the STM\nstructure is reused for the QM model after limited refurbishment. Is it a luxury to\nhave a full functional QM satellite? To some extent yes. In our case it is justified\ndue to the need of building up some further sister satellites (i.e Nanosat-1B that will\nbe launched in 2008), because we typically use the original QM satellite to make\nthe delta qualification tests when developing a new unit or element. On top of that,\nit is of great benefit to have two operational satellites during the development and\nduring the in orbit acceptance campaign.\n\n\n\nDevelopment of the MicroSat Programme at INTA 49\n\nFig. 8 Nano & Microsat plannings\n\n5 Structure and Thermal S/S\n\nThe structure design is based on a traditional concept with separated SVM and PLM.\nThe SVM has a primary structure with an H shape where all its units are attached.\nJust the antennas and the HPA final stage of the X-Band transmitter (for thermal rea-\nsons), are supported by the 4 external panels made in a light Aluminium honeycomb.\nGiven the size of the inner panels and the load factor that also supports the Payload\nmass they are made from a solid aluminium alleviated plate. This configuration also\nprovide thermal benefits, as it distributes the heat from \u201chot\u201d to \u201ccold\u201d units inside\nthe SVM, and then to the cold space with surface adjustable radiators placed in the\nlower SVM plate (-Zs side, also I/F with the launcher).\n\nThermal control is based on the classical passive design, using when required\nmultilayer thermal isolations in the external sides, and radiators where required.\nInside the satellite all units are finished in black and in good thermal contact with\nthe structure when adequate for heat rejection. Only the Lithium-ion battery carries\nheaters to keep it between adequate limits, but most of the time they are off.\n\nAll the Payload instruments are attached to the P/L I/F base plate that hold all the\nloads and transmit them to the SVM structure. Thermal control in principle shall be\nindependent from the SVM, but certain coupling is unavoidable.\n\n6 OBDH S/S\n\nThe OBDH is crucial for the mission success once in orbit and should provide the\nbest performances available today for this kind of small satellites. The Central Pro-\ncessing Unit (CPU) uses Atmel microprocessor TSC-695 (ERC-32), that is a good\ncompromise between performances and full space qualification (Radhard). This is\ncritical, as the design is just single string. Only the TTC transceiver is redundant\n\n\n\n50 M. Angulo et al.\n\non board, because we use a lot of commercial level components (COTS). The CPU\nsingle PCB occupies the lower floor of the OBDH Unit, wile the second and third\nare taken by the Mass Memory Unit (MMU) boards.\n\nA good connectivity between P/L instruments, all SVM S/S units and the central\nprocessor is mandatory in view of performance, flexibility and modularity. The CAN\nbus concept is used for H/K, TC distribution, and for ACS sensors & actuators\ncommunications in real time with the CPU.\n\nFig. 9 OBDH block diagram\n\nDedicated Remote Terminal Units (RTU) with a local 80C32 microcontroller em-\nbedded in a RTAX 250 FPGA, are used to interface with the CAN bus at <500 Kbps.\nHigher speeds (from 1 Mbps to 200 Mbps TBC) needed by the P/L data I/F with the\nMass Memory Unit (MMU), and also during downloads from the MMU to the S & X\nBand modems, is based in a LVDS physical layer and ESA\u2019s SpaceWire protocol.\n\nThe MMU will be placed in the same OBDH Box, and it will use the LEON-2\nSPARC V8 microprocessor embedded in a RTAX-2000 FPGA, together with\nSDRAM memory banks (several Mbits). This \u201cSystem on chip\u201d design will have\nfast processing power and will provide the required I/F with CAN and SpaceWire\nbuses in a quite open and reconfigurable way.\n\n7 Communications S/S\n\nAfter developing the original UHF transceiver for the Nanosat-1 (18 Kbps) in 2003\nand the new improvement for Nano-1B (up to 80 Kbps), we did realise that a further\nstep to S-Band was mandatory for TTC and TM speeds around 2 Mbps for the next\nNanosat-2 and MicroSat missions. The new design was initiated in Nov. 05 within\nthe technology programme, and performed by the same bilateral team AD Telecom \u2013\nINTA. Right now the first EM is already running and been tuned in Barcelona after\n\n\n\nDevelopment of the MicroSat Programme at INTA 51\n\nthe EBB development, and the performances seem well for the RF side. The new\ndigital Modem design uses an Actel RTAX-2000 FPGA, although the EBB & EM\nmodels are based on a Xilinx chip that gives more flexibility in the VHDL SW\ndevelopment, as it allows several programmations.\n\nThis new Modem takes the 70 MHz IF (Inter-mediate Frequency), and after a\nconversion to the digital domain and filtering, it performs several functions: the\nautomatic IF signal tone tracking using a PLL (Phase Locked Loop), automatic\nIF chain gain control, QPSK demo-dulation, symbol & block synchronization, and\nextraction of the base band information. At the same time it takes care of both I/F\nwith the CAN (CPU) and SpaceWire (MMU) buses. In the uplink mode, it sends\nout the TTC received information to the OBDH-CPU through the CAN Bus. When\nperforming the downlink to ground, the data is taken either from the CPU RAM or\nthe MMU, because both hold recorded data (Housekeeping or payload TM). As this\nchannel speed is above the CAN capabilities, we have decided to use the SpaceWire\nbus. This decision is also challenging due to this recent and still in development\nhigh speed technology for space, sponsored by ESA.\n\nRecently, we have organised a development team to start the design of a\ncompletely new X-Band transceiver (R&D project), together with AD Telecom,\nACORDE (Santander) and INTA. Although only the transmitter is sufficient for\nMicroSat, we will make also a receiver in order to qualify it in orbit for other\napplications. Additionally, it could provide a backup TTC channel for the uplink\nthat will increase the mission reliability. Part of the development effort spent on the\nnew digital Modem, will be reused in this band with speed requirements going up\nto 20\u201340 Mbps.\n\nFig. 10 Communications S/S block diagram and interfaces\n\nAll the satellite antennas are developed at INTA, were we have long time experi-\nence and nice testing facilities.\n\n\n\n52 M. Angulo et al.\n\n8 Attitude & Orbit Control S/S\n\nThe Nanosat-1 ACS is a quite simple spinning design with 2 groups of coarse Sun\nSensors (SS) with 3 cells each, 4 simple axis Magnetic Sensors (MS), and 3 coil ac-\ntuators (CA), all developed and qualified at INTA. Nanosat-1B is an Earth pointing\nsatellite due to the medium gain UHF helix antenna, required to improve the store\nand forward communications with mobile terminals on ground. In this case we will\nuse a single momentum wheel, to guaranty the required pointing range between 5?\n\nand 10?. In MicroSat and for the coarse pointing, we will use the same 3 axes MS\ndesign based on a Honeywell magneto resistance COTS chip, and 3 new improved\nSS with 5 cells each. They have dedicated electronics and a common CAN I/F with\nthe CPU. Additionally, a Star Tracker (STR) is mandatory when the pointing re-\nquirements are stringent. For the first mission we will use the well known DTU\n?Star sensor with probably 2 optical heads 90? apart.\n\nEither air coils or magnetorods together with 4 reaction wheels are the baseline\nactuators. There will be a new development Control Moment Gyro (CMG) also\ncalled Advanced Gyroscopic Actuator (AGA-150 patented), with two degrees of\nfreedom that will allow fast slewing manoeuvres up to 3?/s in a bang-bang mode,\nbecause the gyroscopic torque provided by this device is very high. It only takes\none second to give such angular speed to the satellite. Nevertheless, it is envisaged\nthat the reaction wheels will be needed for the fine pointing after any rotation ma-\nnoeuvre, and to desaturate the AGA when required. The initial plan is to check first\nin orbit the behaviour and real performances of this R&D actuator, and if it will be\nOK, then try to apply it for nominal image taking during the exploitation phase of\nthe earth observation mission.\n\nIn terms of pointing and slewing requirements, at present we are working with 3\nmission scenarios:\n\n? Fixed Nadir pointing with 0,1? to 1?\n? Earth image taking along and across track (\u00b135?) with 1? to 30?? accuracy\n? Space inertial pointing with 30?? to 1?? accuracy and low speed slewing for retar-\n\ngeting astronomic payloads\n\nThe baseline design is to relay in fixed solar panels for most of the missions, al-\nthough if needed by a particular application, there will be a deployable and rotating\ndesign along the \u00b1Ys axis (symmetrical wings). Number of modes and transition\nrules are now been studied.\n\n9 Power S/S\n\nTheprimarybuspowerprovidedby the4fixedsolarpanelswillbea28 Vnonregulated\nbus concept (battery voltage tracker). The number of strings connected to this bus in\nreal time will be in accordance with the required power in the satellite.

The battery will\nbe an 18 Ah (SAFT) design already qualified for PROBA-2.\n\n10 INTA?SAT-1 Mission Description\n\nFor the first flight it has been selected an Earth observation mission, relying\non previous experience with the following cameras at INTA: IRIS engineering\nmodel 5m PAN camera development (1999), OMC for Integral (2001), and OSIRIS\nNAC & WAC contributions for ESA mission Rosetta (Jan. 2004).\n\nExternal\nBaffle\n\nFocal plane \n\nX-band\nAntenna\n\nS-band\nAntennas\n\nAccess to SVM\n& PLM connectors\n\nMIR & TIR\ncameras\n\nMLI\n\n4 Solar panels\n\nStar & solar\nsensors\n\nSVM\n\nPLM\n\nFig. 11 INTA?SAT-1 general view\n\nThis is very challenging for a completely new development, considering both the\nSVM and the camera at the same time; however, it has an R & D purpose and not\na full operational need. For this reason, the satellite will make use of almost all its\nresources and S/S capabilities now in the development phase (most probably it will\nnot have a propulsion S/S). The Control Centre will be installed at INTA in Torrejo?n\n(same for Minisat-01 and Nanosat-01). The 5 m dish S-Band antenna is already\nthere but needs some refurbishment, and the 10 m X-band antenna will be shared\nonce installed with the bigger SEOSAT (Spanish Earth Observation Satellite), now\nin phase-A. The previous experience developing and operating other small satellites\nwill be of great benefit.\n\n\n\n54 M. Angulo et al.\n\n11 Conclusions\n\n1. Very interesting micro & nano-technology and diffuse IR OWLS experiments\nare running OK in Nanosat-1, in orbit since 18 Dec. 04.\n\n2. We have developed with success all the units, subsystems and space & ground\nsegment at INTA, with the help of other national research centres, some Spanish\nUniversities, and a small RF company in Barcelona.\n\n3. Nanosat-1B is a sister satellite, that will be launched in 2008 to complement the\nstore and forward communication mission of the first mission. It will carry new\nnano & micro technology experiments.\n\n4. Nanosat-2 is an improved new generation with increased capabilities (ERC-32\nOBDH, 2Mbps TTC+TN transceiver, 3 axis control ACS, etc.) but with the same\nphilosophy.\n\n5. Since Nov. 05 we have started the MicroSat programme, a 100\u2013150 Kg microsatel-\nlite as a further step. This again will follow the same principles and development\nrules of Nanosat, together with the acquired know-how and lessons learned up\nto now.\n\n6. The target for the MicroSat development planning since the programme pre-\nsentation in Oct. 05, was to have ready the first mission in 4 years (end 2009-\nbeginning of 2010). At this stage near to the middle of Phase-B and thanks to\nthe R+D technology effort dedicated to new developments, this objective seems\nrealistic and reachable.\n\n7. Apart INTA internal budget, the programmes are been supported by external\nfounding since 2005 (PNE-CDTI) to develop an Advanced CMG that will be\nqualified in orbit (SAGAS-150). This will provide to INTA?SAT-1 a torque 500\ntimes higher when compared with traditional reaction wheels. The baseline is to\nuse it to rotate very fast the satellite (3?/s) in an experimental mode. The wheels\nand coil torquers will be the nominal actuators.\n\n8. We have just made a new proposal to the PNE-07 (CDTI) to fully develop an\nAdvanced Communications S/S in X-Band (AD Telecom). This includes new\nantennas (INTA) and power amplifiers (ACORDE from Santander).\n\n9. The first mission will carry a Mid Resolution Multispectral Camera (10\u201312 m\nGSD) with 3 to 4 channels. We are starting by now the work and setting the\nrequirements for this new camera that will be fully develop at INTA, as the first\nPayload for INTA?SAT-1.\n\nAcknowledgements The Nanosat and MicroSat programmes are running thanks to several fund-\ning from the National Space Plan, either Scientific (PNE) or Technical (CDTI), and from our\ninternal budget. We will like also to thank INTA top level management, for their big support and\nencouraging recommendations along the past years.\n\nReference\n\n1. M. Angulo, MR. Canchal, JM.

Baker, Philip Davies, and Lee Boland\n\nAbstract This paper outlines the heritage and future plans of SSTL in enabling\nhigh performance cost effective Earth observation services through constellations\nof small spacecraft. The paper will discuss two new spacecraft for customers in\nSpain and Nigeria, and how these meet traditional needs for Earth Observation\ndata at a low cost. The range of payload options which SSTL can offer for a wide\nvariety of Earth imaging applications covering high and medium resolution, wide\narea coverage, frequent revisits and near real-time tasking and data return in various\nwavebands, including visible light and microwave will be discussed. Applications\nenabled through SSTL\u2019s heritage platform capability, the optical payload group (for-\nmerly Sira Space group) and SSTL\u2019s business unit DMC Imaging International,\nDMCii will be discussed to illustrate the utility of small satellites for real, com-\nmercial applications.\n\n1 SSTL Small Satellite Heritage\n\nThe first five satellites of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) launched\nin 2002\u20132005 demonstrated the humanitarian value of Earth imaging using cost-\neffective small satellites and, having met the primary objectives of their buyers, are\nnow facilitating the delivery of commercial earth observation data services. The\nBritish National Space Centre provided \u00a315M in funding through the MOSAIC\n(MicroSatellite Applications in Collaboration) programme from 2000 which helped\ndevelop the SSTL \u2018enhanced\u2019 microsatellite platform and camera through three\nfunded missions. MOSAIC also funded the TOPSAT consortium, lead by QinetiQ\n\nA.M. Baker\nSurrey Satellite Technology Ltd, United Kingdom\ne-mail: a.baker@sstl.co.uk\n\nP.

Baker et al.\n\nwith an SSTL platform and a RAL camera, and initial development of the GeMini\nlow cost geostationary microsatellite platform.\n\nMOSAIC has now leveraged significant export sales, commencing with AlSat-1\nfor the Algerian Space Agency (CNTS), and the first DMC satellite the Nigerian\nAgency for Space Research & Development (NASRDA), the Turkish Ministry of\nScience and Technology research institute BILTEN TUBITEK and the Chinese\nMinistry of Science & Technology have since purchased Disaster Monitoring Con-\nstellation spacecraft.\n\nThe partners formed the DMC consortium, agreeing to reserve 5% of system\ncapacity for disaster management, to operate as part of a constellation, to share\ndata, and to investigate commercial exploitation of the data. In November 2005, the\nDMC, coordinated by SSTL\u2019s business unit DMC Imaging International (DMCii)\nofficially joined the \u201cInternational Charter: Space and Major Disasters\u201d, supply-\ning broad daily image coverage during disasters such as hurricane Katrina and the\nIndian Ocean Tsunami.\n\nThe Beijing-1 microsatellite was added to the constellation after launch in October\n2005. Beijing-1 is the first DMC+4 spacecraft built by SSTL [1]. DMC+4 combines\nthe basic DMC wide area multispectral payload with a 4 m Ground Sample Distance\n(GSD) panchromatic instrument, to provide continuity of DMC data (for example\ngenerating a cloud free map of China within 6 months) and to carry out systematic\nmapping at a higher resolution (in support of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games).\n\n2 The Benefits of Constellations\n\nThe key benefit of a constellation of small spacecraft is that high temporal resolu-\ntion can be matched with high spatial resolution, at a mission cost well within that\nof a single conventional large remote sensing spacecraft. Metrics comparing the\nperformance of various constellations typically compare timeliness, where satellites\nrequires days but terrestrial systems can deliver hours, against either area cover-\nage/field of regard, or resolution. Satellites can cover hundreds to hundreds of thou-\nsands of square kilometres, depending on the resolution, against hundreds of square\nkilometres for aerial platforms. The latter however can offer resolution in the tens\nof cm range, although satellites are rapidly catching up, with the latest generation\nof \u2018Orbview-5\u2019 spacecraft designed by Digital Globe claiming 0.41 m GSD at nadir.\nHowever the revisit period of such spacecraft is typically 2\u20133 days, the maximum\nresolution is only gained in the image centre, and capability itself has cost in the\norder of $500M to develop (based on the NextView contract value). In contrast, a\ntypical small spacecraft such as NigeriaSat-2 can be built for an order of magnitude\nless, will offer a GSD as low as 2 m, and can offer daily repeat with as few as 2\nspacecraft, both of which can be positioned using a single low cost launcher.\n\nThe plots above demonstrate the increasing capability of cameras and sensor\narrays available for small satellite platforms, enabling attractive combinations of\nwide field of regard, rapid repeat and high resolution to be affordable.\n\n\n\nMoving Towards Commercial Earth Observation Services 59\n\nFig. 1 Timeliness v. area\ncoverage for different sensor\noptions, focus on tactical\napplications\n\nFig. 2 Revisit period v.\nspatial resolution for\ntraditional v. small satellite\nspace-based options, focus on\nEarth resources\n\nDespite the obvious value of small satellite constellations for tactical applica-\ntions, and the successful operation of Topsat launched in October 2005, the first pur-\npose built small satellite constellation for a single customer, RapidEye, was funded\nwith commercial returns in mind.\n\nRapidEye aims to deliver Earth agricultural and insurance industry specific in-\nformation products derived from multispectral wide area Earth Observation data.\n\nRapidEye will serve 3 markets:\n\n1. Agricultural Insurance: supporting the loss adjustment process by provision of\nregularly updated field maps.\n\n2. Agricultural Producers: assisting precision farming by regularly providing infor-\nmation about crop conditions and yield predictions.\n\n3. International Institutions: assessing expected crop harvests and monitor usage of\nsubsidies for disaster relief.\n\nSSTL, acting as platform provider and satellite integrator to MDA in Canada,\nwill launch the RapidEye constellation of 5 satellites in the second half of 2007.\n\n\n\n60 A.M. Baker et al.\n\nThe five RapidEye platforms take some features from TOPSAT and Beijing-1,\nwhile additionally focusing on meeting the mission requirements in the shortest\npossible time (24 months) at the lowest overall price for a constellation (? \u00a320M).\n\nFig. 3 RapidEye during camera/platform integration at SSTL\n\n3 New Optical Spacecraft for SSTL\n\nSSTL is designing two new Earth Observation spacecraft for customers in Spain\nand Nigeria. Spain DMC is funded through anticipated data sales to a small set of\ncountries, and will reach new levels of image throughput performance for the next\ngeneration DMC constellation.\n\n3.1 Spain DMC\n\nThe principal mission level improvement of Spain DMC compared to previous\nDMC spacecraft is to increase image throughput, such that the cost of spacecraft\ncan be offset by data sales. To this end, subsystem design changes include\n\ni. Addition of X-band data downlink, increasing the data rate from the 8 Mbps of\nthe early DMC S-band system to over 20 Mbps.\n\nii. Replacement of NiCd battery with higher capacity, greater Depth of Discharge,\nhigher energy density and longer life Li-Ion battery.\n\niii. Improving the imager resolution has been increased from 32 m to 22 m at nadir\nwithout reducing swath, by utilising a custom lens and the latest CCD linear\narray, while maintaining overall mass, envelope and power consumption. Digi-\ntisation fidelity has also been improved from 8 to 10 bit.\n\nThe spacecraft envelope & mass at 100 kg, as well as orbit at 686 km with LTAN\n10:30 am, a lifetime of 5 years, compatibility with the DMC ground segment and an\n18 month build are identical to the current DMC spacecraft.\n\nThe operations strategy targets maximum imaging time in the sunlit part of the\norbit. Operating modes with imaging and downlinking data during each orbit, and\nimaging orbits followed by downlinking orbits have been developed. A key cus-\ntomer requirement is to deliver complete coverage of Spain and Portugal within 5\ndays using a combination of operating modes. This requires a significant increase\nin the number of scenes per day delivered to the customer, compared to the original\n\n\n\nMoving Towards Commercial Earth Observation Services 61\n\nDMC spacecraft. A balance is struck between covering the maximum area per orbit,\nwhich requires a subsequent orbit or orbits to downlink all the data, and reducing the\narea covered but allowing all operations to be conducted within an orbit. A future\ngoal for SSTL missions is to allow stripmap imaging, where the imager can be run\ncontinuously in parallel to downlinking for the sunlit part of the orbit. This would\ndeliver up to 12M km2 of imagery per orbit, assuming the ground segment could\nhandle this data throughput!\n\nFig. 4 SSTL-100 platform,\nSpain-DMC\n\nFig. 5 SSTL-300 platform,\nNigeriaSat-2\n\n3.2 NigeriaSat-2\n\nNigeriaSat-2 will obeffer the most capable high performance imaging system based\non small satellites for the price. Through a combination of wide area multispec-\ntral imagery compatible with SPOT and Landsat ETM, and 2.5 m resolution VHR\npanchromatic and 5 m multispectral imagery, a range of imaging modes will be\npossible to enable agricultural, mapping, security and disaster monitoring services.\n\n\n\n62 A.M. Baker et al.\n\nNigeriaSat-2, weighing about 300 kg at launch, will feature a high-capacity\nsolid-state onboard recorder with a 16-gigabyte memory and an X-band downlink\ncapacity exceeding 100 megabits per second. In excess of 150 accurately geolo-\ncated images with a 2.5 m GSD (PAN) and 5 m GSD (multispectral) per day will be\nproduced from the 686 km altitude orbit over a period of seven years.\n\nNigeriaSat-2, shown above will be built in 30 months and is scheduled for\nlaunch in mid-2009 along with a co-passenger NigeriaSat-X which will be an ad-\nvanced training model for the Nigerian engineers who began their training with the\nNigeriaSat-1 DMC spacecraft launched in 2003.\n\nThe table below compares SSTL\u2019s three Earth Observation platform products:\n\nTable 1 Comparison of SSTL spacecraft platform product lines\n\nSSTL-100 (Spain\nDMC)\n\nSSTL-150 (RapidEye,\nBeijing-1)\n\nSSTL-300\n(NigeriaSat-2)\n\nPAN imager GSD and swath N/A 2.8\u20134 m, 17\u201322 km ?2.5 m, 20\u201330 km\nM/S imager GSD and swath 22\u201332 m, 600 km 5.6\u20138.7 m, 78\u2013104 km,\n\n1500 km long swath\n?32 m, 300 or\n\n600 km\nColour wavebands 3: R, G, NIR 5: VNIR 4: R, G, B, NIR\nImage throughput >4/day\n\n(600 km \u00d7 600 km)\nTypically\n\n80\u2013100 km \u00d7 1500 km\nswath per orbit using\nMR camera\n\n>100/day\n\nLifetime 5 years 7 years >7 years\nOn-orbit data archive 2 Gb Up to 8 Gb >120 Gb\nDownlink data rate >8 Mbps 40 Mbps >100 Mbps\nOff pointing No Yes Yes\nImage quality 8\u201310 bit.

Missions studies have ranged from altimetry, geolocating\nelectronic intelligence signals, spectrometry of a wide range of atmospheric species\nand greenhouse gases, and both active and passive microwave imaging.\n\nMindful of the breadth of the market for Earth Observation and small satellites,\nSSTL spacecraft continue to be designed in an adaptable modular fashion which can\nsupport multiple payload options. Two popular options are detailed below:\n\nSSTL developed the wide area medium resolution SLIM-6 camera, shown below,\nand in 2006 acquired the optical instrument capability of the UK firms Sira electro-\noptics, which developed the Beijing-1 microsatellite high resolution imager, also\nshown below:\n\nFig. 6 SLIM-6, medium\nresolution ultra-wide field\ncamera developed for DMC\n\nFig. 7 High resolution\nnarrow angle panchromatic\nand multispectral camera\n\nSSTL can now offer a range of payloads covering visible and infrared wavebands\nand microwave frequencies, delivering a unique blend of high resolution, wide area\ncoverage, frequent revisits and near real-time tasking & data.\n\n\n\n64 A.M.

SSTL\u2019s mi-\ncrosatellites have also attracted the interest of ESA as gapfillers for its GMES pro-\ngramme an Sentinel spacecraft.\n\nSub-1 m GSD performance using a microsatellite platform is being examined\nby SSTL in collaboration with a leading UK payload provider, allowing additional\nproduction capacity to meet the requirements of future constellations.\n\nSSTL is also working with a leading payload provider to be able to offer a Syn-\nthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) payload ready for launch as early as the end of 2010.\nThis mission would deliver 10\u201330 m GSD, swath widths of 50\u2013100 km in a single\npolarisation, X- or C-wavebands and <\u201325 dB Ne?0 radiometric resolution.\n\nFurther payloads being studied by SSTL and in collaboration with other com-\npanies include GNSS-reflectometry for monitoring wave height and wind speed to\ncomplement buoy data, and compact uncooled imaging spectrometers for green-\nhouse gas monitoring such as CO2.\n\nTwo example mission configurations under study include an Earth mapper de-\nsigned to provide continuity to LandSat VII using a constellation of 4 small\nsatellites, and an ultra-low cost SAR mission delivering performance compara-\nble to DMC and priced comparable to optical SSTL-300 based missions, shown\nbelow:\n\n\n\nMoving Towards Commercial Earth Observation Services 65\n\nFig. 8 Concept for LandSat\nData Continuity Mission,\nwith SWIR imager and\n4-band VNIR wide swath\nmultispectral camera\n\nFig. 9 Concept for Ultra Low\nCost SAR spacecraft based\non RapidEye platform,\ndelivering all-weather and\nday-night data equivalent to\nthe DMC\n\n5 Applications\n\nExample applications of DMC which have led to the creation of the DMCii value\nadded data sales business unit of SSTL include:\n\n? Field level monitoring of crop health in the UK and Europe, in combination with\nhigh resolution aerial images.\n\n? Illicitcropmapping&classification, forexampleOpiumproductioninAfghanistan\nat the request of the United Nations Office on Drugs & Crime.\n\n? Monitoring Amazonian logging and deforestation management for INPE (the\nBrazilian Space Agency), imaging the entire Amazon basin annually.\n\n? Monitoring the rate of calving of the Greenland ice sheet, which would raise\nglobal sea level temperatures by 7 m, were it to melt entirely.\n\nFurthermore, SSTL\u2019s CHRIS (Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer)\nhyperspectral instrument, hosted by the ESA PROBA spacecraft celebrated its 5th\nbirthday in September 2006. A user forum in Frascati, Italy attended by 60 delegates\ndemonstrated how CHRIS and PROBA instrument data supports the research of 100\nEO projects from nearly 30 countries worldwide. CHRIS is currently the highest\nresolution capability spectrometer in orbit, and with a mass of only 14 kg and a\npower draw of 8 W is a highly attractive payload for a small spacecraft. Example ap-\nplications include mapping aerosol concentrations, water and land surface use, and\nchlorophyll concentrations.

These\nare now a mature technology and have demonstrated their potential as a product\nwith complementary performances to more conventional mission solutions.\n\nRecent successes with the PROBA 1 (with more than 5 years of operations in\norbit) and the UK\u2019s Topsat spacecraft show the potential to use these platforms\nin flexible and low-cost ways for Earth Observation missions. ESA\u2019s Earth Obser-\nvation Directorate uses PROBA 1 on a daily basis in support of research related\nto vegetation, disaster monitoring, land use, volcano observations, etc. Topsat sup-\nports a number of users with up to date imagery and has demonstrated several new\napproaches to data downlink & distribution.\n\nWith continued advances in technology, new areas in Earth observation are being\nexplored and applications like high resolution-, hyper spectral- and small SAR radar\nmissions become feasible with a PROBA scale platform and its derivatives.\n\nAs small satellite missions become more ambitious, so the space industry is\nadapting to the challenge of creating organisations which can deliver the advantages\nof small satellite technology while retaining compatibility with international data\nstandards and operating practices. The merging of Verhaert Space and QinetiQ\u2019s\nSpace Division is a first step in the creation of a solid mid-tier player dedicated to\nsmall mission solutions, combining complementary skills in mission design, system\nintegration and key areas of technology development to offer end-to-end solutions\nto customers worldwide.\n\nThis paper will outline high-performance solutions for future Earth observation\nmissions, highlighting the role that cutting-edge technologies have to delivering\nunique capability to meet customer needs.\n\nJ.

Dorn\n\n1 Small Missions Heritage\n\n1.1 Proba 1/Proba 2\n\nMid nineties, ESA initiated the idea for building a small satellite for technology\ndemonstration purposes, called PROBA (Project for On-Board Autonomy). With the\nfinancial support from the Belgian Science Policy Office to ESA\u2019s General Support\nTechnology Programme (GSTP), Verhaert Space finally could win the phase C/D\ncontract that started in February 1998.\n\nPROBA 1 is the first Belgian small satellite and is developed by Verhaert\nSpace as prime contractor. The satellite, only weighing 94 kg with dimensions\n80 \u00d7 60 \u00d7 60 cm, was realised in about 3 years. The strong features of the\nPROBA platform lie in the field of autonomous operation (low operational cost), its\nsimplicity in operation, its performant attitude control system and its strong Le?on\nbased computing capability. PROBA\u2019s 3-axis attitude control system provides fine-\npointing capabilities, resulting in precise snapshot images (e.g. HRC instrument \u2013\n4 m pan images) and has agility to execute demanding mapping and push-broom\nscanning scenarios (e.g. CHRIS instrument \u2013 18 m multispectral images).\n\nAlthough designed for a lifetime of only 2 years, PROBA 1 is now functioning\nin-orbit for more than 5 years and providing earth observation images through ESA\nto the science community on a daily basis.\n\nIn the meantime, its successor PROBA 2 carrying sun observation instruments is\nunder final integration at Verhaert Space and is planned for launch early 2008.\n\nThe PROBA platforms are operated through a small ground station (2,4 m dish)\nlocated at the ESA Redu site in the Belgian Ardennes.\n\nFig. 1 PROBA 1 on PSLV\nlauncher (ISRO./Antrix)\n\n\n\nPROBA Spacecraft Family 69\n\nFig. 2 PROBA/HRC Image\nof pyramids of Gizeh (ESA)\n\nFig. 3 PROBA/Chris image\nof 3 gorges dam China\n(ESA/SIRA)\n\nFig. 4 PROBA 2 under\nintegration at Verhaert Space\n\n\n\n70 J. Bermyn, C. Dorn\n\n1.2 TopSat 1\n\nOn 27th October 2005, TopSat was successfully launched. It has since been produc-\ning high quality imagery to satisfy a range of user requests.\n\nThe purpose of the programme is primarily to demonstrate the ability to build\nand operate a low cost optical satellite capable of generating high quality imagery.\n\nFig. 5 TopSat spacecraft\nplatform (outer panels\nremoved for clarity)\n\nFig. 6 Image of Marseilles,\nFrance\n\nThe satellite produces panchromatic imagery (17 \u00d7 17km) with a spatial resolution\nof 2.8 m, and multi-spectral imagery (12 \u00d7 18km) with 5.6 m resolution. Imagery is\n\n\n\nPROBA Spacecraft Family 71\n\nroutinely downloaded to QinetiQ\u2019s ground station at West Freugh, Scotland, where\nit is forwarded to the Payload Operations Centre in Farnborough for processing and\ndissemination to users.\n\nFig. 7 The West Freugh\nground station\n\nFig. 8 The RAPIDS mobile\nground station\n\nIn addition, QinetiQ has developed a mobile ground station, consisting of a 2.7 m re-\nceiving dish towed by a Land Rover, which has demonstrated the ability to downlink\nnear-real time TopSat imagery directly to end users.\n\n1.3 New Approaches\n\nMissions such as Topsat and Proba are made possible by the pragmatic application\nof key technologies and new approaches to the programmatic and system design.\nA flexible response to the customers needs is the hallmark of the QinetiQ-Verhaert\napproach.Simplifiedprogrammaticstructures, integrated teams,on-boardautomation\nand new technologies all have their part to play in reducing costs. The mission must be\n\n\n\n72 J. Bermyn, C. Dorn\n\nviewed as a complete system and the component segments design to minimise through\nlife costs by matching risk with customer expectation and technical solutions.\n\n2 Small Mission Solutions\n\nSmall satellites can play an important role for earth observation applications, which\nis proven in the meantime by the successful PROBA/Topsat missions.\n\nTo date, the application field stays limited to imagery with up to a few meters\nof ground resolution and a few spectral bands in the visible and near-infrared spec-\ntrum. Clearly, this is driven by the resources and performances available on small\nplatforms but thanks to the evolving technologies on payloads and platform side a\nlot of other applications come within our reach.\n\nA nice example of this capability improvement is demonstrated on PROBA 2;\ncompared to PROBA 1 the payload carrying capability is increased from 30% to\n40%. A major contribution in this improvement is coming from our on-board com-\nputer based on the Le?on chip, 3,3 V and SMD component technology.\n\nSmall missions will never be suited, and are not intended, to replace the full\ncapability of large systems, but they will be a very interesting complement to it.\nSmall missions may be able to provide solutions for 80% of the requirements at only\n20% of the cost and as such are very interesting as gapfiller, precursor or stand-alone\nsolution.\n\nOver the years, several concepts and ideas wore worked out to show the potential\nof our PROBA platform for emerging applications. Indeed, we can talk about the\nProba Spacecraft Family of which some key potential is highlighted hereafter.\n\n2.1 Small Satellites for Earth Observation\n\nFuture important application fields for small missions lie in the area of high-\nresolution images (security \u2013 dual use), more spectral bands (vegetation \u2013 precision\nfarming) and SAR imagery (overnight visibility).\n\nClearly, this type of instruments requires more power, more volume, more data\nstorage & downlink capability, but smart solutions and optimisations allow over-\ncoming of the challenges.\n\nSeveral studies were carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of following mis-\nsions based on a PROBA platform:\n\n2.1.1 High Resolution\n\nThe major challenge for this type of missions is the thermal stability on the instru-\nment and platform stability required to provide sharp images.\n\nAvailability of high performance gyro\u2019s in combination with a performant at-\ntitude control system on the satellite, allow to build PROBA satellites which can\nprovide ground resolutions up to 1 meter (e.g. ARGUS phase A study for ESA).\n\n\n\nPROBA Spacecraft Family 73\n\n2.1.2 Multispectral/Hyperspectral/Lidar\n\nAccess to QinetiQ\u2019s specialised hollow wave guide technologies offer the possibil-\nity of smaller sensors which will deliver comparable optical performance on small\nsatellites. New mission solutions including Lidar and microwave sounder systems\nwill become possible with QinetiQ\u2019s Gallium Nitride technologies. These offer the\npossibility of even smaller and more electrically efficient sub-systems. Currently a\nstudy for a multispectral mission, called PROBA Landobs, is ongoing.\n\nMulti \u2013 and hyper spectral instruments work typical at lower resolutions but\ngenerate huge amounts of data. Here solutions can be worked out in several areas,\nstarting with data capturing optimisation (to reduce the capture of un-usable data),\ndata compression and storage and high power downlink capacity.\n\n2.1.3 Radar\n\nRadar missions on a small satellite are a challenge since we have to deal with rela-\ntively large antenna systems and large peak power requirements.\n\nStudies are ongoing to fly optimised systems with shorter lifetime (less redun-\ndancy) on a small platform, and investigation continues in to low altitude missions.\n\n2.1.4 Formation Flying\n\nFormation flying with small platforms is demonstrating the usefulness for pre?-cursor\nmissions. Before entering in a very ambitious science mission, critical technologies\ncan be developed and demonstrated in orbit in a fast and cost-effective way.\n\nCurrently, two parallel phase A studies are on-going for ESA for a PROBA 3\nformation flying mission.\n\n2.1.5 Microgravity Platform\n\nVerhaert Space performed for ESA a study (Wakeshield type of platform for high-\nquality microgravity research). In this concept, we use a PROBA based free-flyer\nwhich operates in the vicinity of the ISS. The challenges added to the platform are\nrelated to docking & payload exchange and the triple redundancy required for safety\nrelated aspects.\n\n2.1.6 Small Satellites for Interplanetary Mission\n\nNEO missions such as SIMONE, as well as ESMO and Don Quijote are predicated\non the use of electronic propulsion (EP) to access regions of the inner solar system\n(beyond Earths gravitational influence).\n\nIn addition to the existing LEO applications of small spacecraft, new missions\nare being developed to utilise small satellites in other Earth orbits. Access to MEO,\nGTO and even GEO is becoming possible with new upper stages and launchers.\nThese can be coupled with a range of propulsion systems for new mission solutions.\n\n\n\n74 J. Bermyn, C. Dorn\n\n2.2 Small Satellites for Great Science\n\nSmall satellites offer the following advantages for science missions in LEO, GEO,\nGTO and the inner solar system:-\n\n? More measurements = better science\n? Lower cost = affordable where previously assumed not\n? Single primary instrument = optimised missions\n? Smaller consortia = less compromise (on mission issues)\n? Shorter build times = faster response\n? Lower cost and faster response = more missions\n\nQinetiQ-Verhaert is involved in the following key areas that make such missions\npossible:-\n\n? Concept Development (technical and consortia)\n? System prime\n? Core bus with Electric propulsion options\n? Technology insertion (into science group designed instruments)\n? Technology adoption at bus level (for greater payload capacity)\n? Technology delivery (key subsystems with flight heritage)\n? Mission Management and operations\n\n3 Qinetiq & Verhaert Space, Your Partner\nfor Small Space Missions\n\nThe acquisition by QinetiQ of Verhaert Space in September 2005 paves the way\nin the creation of THE small space missions company in Europe. The joining of\nskills from QinetiQ\u2019s space division \u2013 with a lot of heritage in mission design and\ninnovative technologies, and Verhaert Space \u2013 a seasoned small (smart) space sys-\ntems integrator, creates an entity that can offer attractive small mission solutions to\ngovernmental and commercial customers worldwide.\n\nAs small missions prime, we enter the so-called Mid-Tier segment, where chal-\nlenging missions based on small satellite platforms will be developed.\n\nSmall missions require smart and innovative solutions but at the same time they\nhave to stay affordable and require realisation within reasonable timescales. In fact,\nthese projects are too big for small companies (risk & capabilities) and too small for\nlarge companies (priority & cost effectiveness).\n\nThe QinetiQ-Verhaert teaming allows such mission to be undertaken in an appro-\npriate and efficient way, with the right priority (small mission are a key account for\nus). Furthermore, we combine the flexibility and cost efficient approach of smaller\norganisations with the quality standards, facilities and credibility of larger organ-\nisations. As such we provide optimum value-for-money while delivering flexible\nsolution that meet the customer\u2019s real needs.\n\n\n\nPROBA Spacecraft Family 75\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nThe Verhaert Space \u2013 QinetiQ team can offer a wide range of small satellite solu-\ntions based on the PROBA spacecraft family.\n\nThe strong points are:\nReliable/robust platform\n\n? Five years in orbit and still in excellent shape (original mission: 1 year)\n\nDemonstrated its potential as Earth observation plaform:\n\n? Orginally pure technology demonstration, but now part of earth observa-\ntion user programme\n\n? Used on daily basis by ?60 user groups\nAutonomous Operation\n\n?

During the summer 2006, 33\nstudents from the International Space University (ISU) worked on a project aiming\nat making EO accessible to small countries and regions. Although EO programs\nare costly to initiate, they are often feasible and beneficial for small countries and\nregions. However an information gap exists between EO providers and decision\nmakers. This is the reason why a prototype software \u201cselection\u201d tool was developed\nto assist regional and national leaders in determining which EO capabilities are\nuseful to them and how to initiate a program. As small satellites are amongst the\ncheapest systems to develop and launch, this will often be the preferred option of\nsmall countries and regions, and the selection tool is thus likely to bring benefits\nto the small satellite industry. The region of Catalonia, one of the three test cases\nstudied in the project, is used as example to illustrate this statement.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThroughout the last several decades, civil Earth Observation programs have become\nvaluable tools for decision makers at various levels. Examples of such decision mak-\ners include resource managers, urban and regional planners; agricultural producers\nand disaster first responders. Examples of EO applications include facilitating public\nservices and natural resource management. Earth Observation data can be especially\nuseful for small countries and regions in assisting their future development. How-\never a gap often exists between the capabilities of EO systems to serve applications\nand the knowledge base of decision makers about EO capabilities, especially at the\nlevel of small countries and regions. EO programs are often technologically complex\nand costly to initiate and are therefore difficult to develop with the limited budget of\na small country or region. However, in some cases, small countries and regions that\n\nA.

Schoenmaker\n\ncarefully investigate and develop EO programs can establish their own EO programs\ndespite the cost and complexity issues. Alternatively, cooperation between regions\nor small countries can allow regions to overcome resource constraints and lack of\nexpertise to harness the potential of these powerful technologies. Small countries\nand regions establishing EO capacity, whether they are cooperating or not, must\ndetermine the most cost-effective way of implementing this capacity. Several op-\ntions exist for these actors to take full advantage of EO technology to answer their\nneeds. Amongst them, buying existing data, obtaining data free of charge or com-\nmercially, or developing their own system, are the most realistic ones. Developing\na space-based system for a small country or region with a limited budget almost\nautomatically implies small satellites.\n\n2 The Sol Project\n\nThirty-three students of the International Space University (ISU), from sixteen dif-\nferent countries, during the Summer Session Program (SSP) 2006, worked on this\nissue and completed a project named SOL (Syste?me d\u2019Observation Locale or Local\nObservation System)[1]. To bridge the identified gap between EO providers, who\npossess the data, and decision makers, who could apply the information, the project\ndeveloped a prototype software \u201cselection\u201d tool, using background information and\nexpertise about EO operating at regional scales, that would assist small countries and\nregions in identifying options for the most useful and cost-effective EO programs.\nThe prototype was developed using three test cases that have shown an interest in\ndeveloping an EO program: Catalonia, Spain; Alsace, France; and the Island of\nMauritius.\n\nEarth observations are a technologically complex and costly set of tools that can\nbe instituted effectively for small countries and regions, if developed appropriately.\nFive major, non-exclusive options for developing EO capacity were identified:\n\n1. Obtain EO data from existing aerial and satellite EO data providers;\n2. Establish aerial EO programs;\n3. Develop locally owned and operated satellite EO systems (small satellites);\n4. Create a data processing centre that converts data to information for decision\n\nmakers; or\n5. Any or all of the above in cooperation with another small country or region.\n\nEO developers must assess the applications, needs, technical capabilities, and\npolicy and legal implications of using the technology. Developing an Earth Obser-\nvation project is a truly interdisciplinary work, and this is how this project was put\ntogether.\n\nThe following figures show how the same EO process can be seen from different\nperspectives: technical and financial.\n\nIndeed, the technical process is a very important aspect of an EO system, but\na country or region envisaging building its own EO system should not overlook\n\n\n\nSmall Satellites and Earth Observation Systems for Small Countries and Regions 79\n\nFig. 1 EO process flow\n\nFig. 2 EO value chain\n\nthe importance of other aspects of the program. An understanding of the financial\nconsiderations for EO programs is one of the most essential points. A proposed\nvalue chain for EO systems, from the EO provider and to the end users who exploit\nthe information is shown in Fig. 2. The principal concepts applied to the value chain\nare the EO ventures analyzed, cost estimating methods and financing options.\n\nWhen a small country or region develops EO programs, the national and interna-\ntional policies and legal framework for space should also be considered, in concert\nwith the technological development path and program financing. EO system licens-\ning and data access policies are particularly important because, if ignored, they can\nobstruct the users\u2019 ability to obtain data.\n\nGiven this technological, financial and legal context for EO program develop-\nment, small countries and regions are often best served by employing a coopera-\ntive model, e.g. public-private-partnership (PPP). Using a cooperative model, small\ncountries and regions can overcome obstacles and develop EO programs that meet\nthe specific needs of the region.\n\nThe SOL project encompasses all these different aspects of EO to find out the\nbest options for small countries or regions, whose decision makers are the targets of\nthis study. Apart from providing an interdisciplinary background in Earth Observa-\ntions the project also includes three test cases and the idea of a tool, which will be\ndiscussed next.\n\n3 Catalonia as a Test Case\n\nThe example of Catalonia, an autonomous community of Spain, is the best suited\nexample amongst the test cases studied, to illustrate the importance of small satellite\ntechnology in small countries and regions. The local economy of Catalonia is highly\n\n\n\n80 A. Schoenmaker\n\ndependent on tourism and industry. Agriculture, including viticulture and cereals, is\nalso an important factor for the economy. Currently, private industry and academic\nresearch centers comprise the extent of EO capabilities in Catalonia; however, inter-\nest in expanding EO capability locally has grown recently. This project has identified\nan opportunity for Catalonia to consider developing a regional EO system to stimu-\nlate local industry and to improve the use of EO for current and future applications.\n\nEO can be useful in Catalonia for viticulture, mapping, environmental monitor-\ning, disaster management, and humanitarian aid. Catalonia is currently using EO\ndata for some applications, but the region could further capitalize on EO technology\nand build capacity in EO system development.\n\nGiven the current capacity and the potential budget for EO systems, a small\ndedicated satellite is one viable option for Catalonia. Such a system could satisfy\nsome of the technical EO needs (e.g., high spatial resolution) for the applications\nidentified above. Discussions between the SOL students and the regional industry\nresulted in an estimated budget of 12 M\u20ac for the region for the test case, taking into\naccount possible future cooperation with other regions.\n\nDifferent sectors where EO could be useful for Catalonia have been analyzed,\nstarting with vineyards. The analysis of the density and vigor of the vine canopy\nis an essential tool to assess the yield and quality of the wine. To achieve such\ntarget, a minimum spatial resolution of at least 1.5 m is required, regardless of the\ntemporal and radiometric resolution constraints. This requirement is driven by the\nconventional vineyard row spacing.\n\nConsidering current available technology and the proposed budget cap of 12 M\u20ac,\none of the options is the use of a multispectral RALCam1 sensor running on a mi-\ncrosatellite platform, with a maximum resolution of 2.5 m. Unfortunately this resolu-\ntion does not provide sufficient resolution for the development of precise viticulture.\nTherefore, another proposed option which should supplement the space-based solu-\ntions is based on airborne systems in combination with on-site ground observations.\nA CASI (Compact Airborne Spectographic Imager) sensor could be installed in an\nairplane to do the observations. This sensor is an optical multispectral sensor, offering\na typical spatial resolution below 1 m, depending on the flight altitude.\n\nConcerning environmental applications, there is a wide range of EO applications\nthat could be tackled by means of different solutions (space-, airborne- or ground-\nbased), and within the set budget constraints. Considering the general approach of\nthis particular example, the possible solutions are very broad. One of the alterna-\ntives would be to buy data from the huge number of currently orbiting satellites and\nsensing systems scattered around the world. Another possibility would be to make\nuse of airborne systems in combination with on-site ground observations.\n\nA feasible space-based solution could be based on the use of a micro-satellite,\nwith medium-to-high resolution sensors. An example of implementation would be\nthe use of a suitable platform to be integrated in the DMC-2 constellation, with\na CHRIS sensor achieving spatial resolutions of about 17 m. With this proposed\nsystem operating in LEO orbits, a vast range of applications could be developed,\nas is the case of mapping and monitoring to assess the change of the territory over\ntime, precision agriculture, urban planning in coastal areas to avoid denaturalization\n\n\n\nSmall Satellites and Earth Observation Systems for Small Countries and Regions 81\n\nof the seashore, forestry, water shed control, wetlands monitoring in the Ebro river\ndelta, coastal erosion control, snow measurement in the Pyrenees, etc.\n\nFig. 3 Ebro river delta [2]\n\nAlthough this proposal is just one of the possible solutions, it is interesting to note\nthe recent signing of a contract between the Spanish company, Deimos Imaging, and\nSurrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) on the DEIMOS satellite to be added\nto the DMC constellation.\n\nThis new development is very encouraging for the small satellite industry in\nSpain, and is related to the third important application in Catalonia: Disaster man-\nagement. In this case, the SOL report advised that the revisit time of the EO systems\nshould be relatively short. Revisiting times below one or two days would be de-\nsired for a proper management of river flooding, as well as for the identification\nof the current state of infrastructures under the effects of any natural disaster of\nshort life time. That is why any new satellite should be integrated into an already\nflying constellation, such as DMC. The same kind of micro-satellite could be used\nby Catalonia for mapping purposes.\n\nAfter this analysis it is thus striking to see all the possible applications of the\ncapabilities of a micro-satellite in this region, whilst staying in a limited budget.\n\nThese proposed systems would however be best developed in cooperation with\nother regions or countries in order to facilitate technology transfer, to encourage po-\nlitical ties between regions, to improve EO system capabilities (e.g., revisit time), and\nto offset some of the system construction and operational costs. This is an aspect that\nis now being addressed by Deimos Imaging by entering into the DMC constellation.\n\n\n\n82 A. Schoenmaker\n\nEO capacity building in Catalonia could result in valuable economic and social\nspin-offs for the region. High-tech EO systems can be beneficial for the local economy\nby stimulating economic growth, industry, commercial development, and fostering\nnew ventures in EO. This would occur if Catalonia began developing its own satellites\nor if the regionestablishedotherEOcompetencies.Adataprocessingcenter, forexam-\nple, could serve regional data processing needs, stimulate revenues for the region, and\nprovide a mechanism for Catalonia to assist other regions in harnessing the potential\nbenefits from EO. A center of this type could be based on a public-private partnership\n(PPP) model. EO capacity building in Catalonia could also encourage scientific and\ntechnology competitiveness and promote scientific education.\n\nThis detailed analysis of one particular region was carried out in order to show\nthe different options to use EO for a small country or region but also to show\nthe parameters that the future \u201cEO decision tool\u201d would take into account to help\ndecision-makers.\n\n4 EO Decision Software\n\nThe identified gap between the knowledge of EO providers and decision makers\nabout EO systems, and the conclusion that each region or country has specific needs,\nled the group to develop a prototype software named SOL Selection Tool (SOLST).\n\nThe idea of this tool came after assessing the existence of tools such as GEOSS.\nGEOSS is a project that attempts to centralize the existing EO databases in order\nto facilitate gap analysis in available data and enhance dissemination and sharing\nof existing EO data. However the scope of GEOSS is limited to sharing observa-\ntional data and connecting information from separate sources. The usefulness of the\nGEOSS centralized database will be limited to experienced users that have already\nidentified the datasets that they need. Accessing GEOSS requires technical expertise\nin EO technology; potential users need a simple tool to help them target needed data\nand assess the cost. As a result, the need to map and centralize existing technologies,\nresearch centers, and added-value actors remains despite the more recent efforts. A\ntool such as SOLST could assist users to target the appropriate options of datasets\nfor a particular application or interest. This issue is pressing for small regions and\ncountries with limited resources. The restricted financial capacity places emphasis\non a tool that can facilitate a search for existing and future EO tools, giving prefer-\nential consideration to cooperation models with other participants in EO.\n\nThe system architecture of the proposed tool is composed of databases, an elec-\ntronic interface, and linkages between the databases and interface. The databases\nconsist of specific information about EO applications, data types and availability,\nand estimated system and data costs. These databases link together in such a way\nthat multiple outputs can be selected, depending on the level of detail sought by the\ntool user. The tool selects EO options with a set of criteria like budget, technical re-\nquirements, applications, and cooperation opportunities. The criteria are not ranked\nby order of importance. The outputs serve as options for the EO system and/or data\nthat are recommended for the region and the application being investigated.\n\n\n\nSmall Satellites and Earth Observation Systems for Small Countries and Regions 83\n\nThe intentions of the user are divided into three main options: building a sys-\ntem; searching for datasets; searching for added-value services (e.g., data processing\nknow-how). A combination of these three options could be selected. A cooperation\nentry can lead to both an output tutorial on cooperative models and an access to\nposted inquiries. The four entries can be independently left blank if unknown by the\nuser. If all are left blank, the user will be directed to a high level introduction to EO\napplications and its potential.\n\nSOLST\nOption 1\n\nOption 2\nOption n\n\nEO \nSolutions \n\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\nOption n\n\nOption 1\nOption 2\n\nOption n\n\nEO \nSolutions \n\nRequirements\n\nApplication\n\nIntent\n\nMaximum Budget\n\nCooperation Option\n\nRequirements\n\nApplication\n\nIntent\n\nMaximum Budget\n\nCooperation Option\n\nFig. 4 SOLST methodology\n\nOrganizing and centralizing the applications, platforms, sensors, and data sources\nis an essential first step in helping local decision makers and potential users. A\nsearch and selection tool can help accomplish this. SOLST would be a tool that ac-\ncesses a centralized database listing EO users, applications, available and emerging\ntechnologies, and EO databases such as the GEOSS database.\n\nThe beneficiaries of SOLST could include decision makers at different levels,\ntechnical EO users, and small countries and regions that are open to collaboration.\nThe primary objectives of SOLST are:\n\n? To increase the awareness of the potential of EO through a high level introduction\nand application-based description;\n\n? To bridge the gap between the potential users of EO systems;\n? To provide an initial set of available EO options based on user selection criteria,\n\nand to give a preliminary overview of options prior to making a local or global\ndecision;\n\n? To guide small countries or regions through the decision-making process by fa-\ncilitating the identification and definition of an EO system that meets their needs;\n\n? To enhance collaboration options particularly for small countries or regions\nthrough the use of a Forum and a posted inquiries compartment; and\n\n? To provide technical EO users an accessible database of EO systems.\n\nSOLST incorporates three primary functions. Apart from the search selection\ntool, an information request option and a forum section should also be included, to\nanswer the needs of the users that are not met in the tool itself. For example it will\nallow them to ask for a summary describing the legal aspects of remote sensing, or to\ninteract with other users of the tool to enhance communication and help cooperation.\n\n\n\n84 A. Schoenmaker\n\nSeveral implementation and maintenance options for the tool have been proposed\nand a prototype database has been constructed. However, this needs further and\nlong-term development and testing to evolve in an operational tool.\n\n5 Benefits of the Project for Small Satellites\n\nThe importance of the tool for small satellites is non negligible. First, it would in-\ncrease the awareness of decision makers about the capabilities of small satellite\ntechnology and therefore increase the demand. For a region like Catalonia, which\nalready has an interest in Earth Observation technology, the tool mainly confirms the\noption that a small satellite would best suit their needs. It adds however that coopera-\ntion would be the best way to go about it, and gives an approximation of the total cost\nthat would have to be invested in such a system. This rapidly accessible information\nmight quicken the process for local decision-makers. The EO documents available in\nthe tool also give them information about already existing small satellite programs.\nIn this case the tool gives an easy access to information about the sought after\ntechnology. In other cases, the tool and the available EO introductory documents\nmight be the first exposure a user has to EO and small satellite technology. The tool\nwould then fulfill its mission of increasing awareness amongst worldwide decision\nmakers about EO, and in this case small satellites. Increasing awareness and giving\neasy access to information will surely help increase the demand for small satellites\nbut also improve the technology, as a variety of payloads might be carried on small\nsatellites. As mentioned earlier, cooperation is often the most reliable and realistic\nway for small countries and regions to gain access to EO data, and this seems to be\nfavorable to small satellites as well. Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) is\na good example of a cooperative venture that led to the development, building and\nlaunching of several identical small satellites.\n\nSecond the tool will help in addressing the limitations of small satellites by\nemphasizing possible trade-offs. For small countries or regions, budget, technical\ncapability and human resources are critical factors. As mentioned before, a small\nsatellite will not usually be feasible for them; cooperation with other entities will\nallow them to spread the costs and the risks and to take advantage of a range of\nsensors or resolutions even if they develop only one themselves.\n\nThird, some specific programs involving small satellite technology such as Know-\nHow Transfer programs and Rent-a-Sat options seem to prove to be very well adapted\nto theneedsof small countriesand regions, as theyare solutionsboth to lackofcapacity\nand lack of funds, two of the main issues for small countries and regions.\n\n6 Conclusion\n\nEO is a powerful tool that has great potential for assisting with environmental man-\nagement and other important applications for small countries and regions. The SOL\nproject is a proposal for EO capacity building in terms of the unique circumstances\n\n\n\nSmall Satellites and Earth Observation Systems for Small Countries and Regions 85\n\nof small countries and regions. The utility of EO for such countries and regions,\nhowever, rests on the ability of an organizing body for the EO program to identify\nand select the most suitable option(s) for EO in the region. This selection must fall\nwithin the technical and budgetary constraints, which are case specific. Combining\ncooperation and small satellites is here often a winning solution.\n\nTo assist in identifying and selecting the best option for the small countries and\nregions, this project has identified one method and illustrated that method using the\nSOLST prototype. In the long term, it is proposed that this method and prototype be\ndeveloped in conjunction with other initiatives that are attempting to facilitate this\ntype of EO program decision.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Funded by the Ministry of Commerce,\nIndustry, and Energy of Korea in 2005, SI has initiated the development of the pro-\ntotype model of an advanced high-performance optical system, the TIS system as\npart of the national space research and development program.\n\nThe TIS system is designed to be versatile with a wide field-of-view, no obscu-\nration, and no refractive element. Therefore, it can be used for various missions\nsuch as super-swath imaging, hyper-spectral imaging, infrared imaging, and aerial\nimaging. In addition, its compactness and light weight are ideal for small satellites.\n\nThe development of two prototype models is planned together with a field test\nfor each model. The progress made so far on the 1st prototype development will\nbe presented: optical design, analysis, and manufacturing; opto-mechanical design,\nanalysis, and manufacturing; and demonstration of hyper-spectral imaging.\n\n2 System Overview\n\nThe TIS system is based on an un-obscured three-mirror-anastigmat (TMA) tele-\nscope that consists of three mirrors. The optical design was simplified to use an\non-axis spherical secondary mirror. The primary and tertiary mirrors are off-axis\nsegmented aspheric mirrors. Its optical aperture is 120 mm, its effective focal length\nis 462 mm, and its full field-of-view is 5.08 degrees. It has a box-type structure with\na dimension of 600mm \u00d7 400mm \u00d7 400mm and the weight is less than 15 kg.\n\nThe key features of the TIS system are listed in Table 1. As can be seen in\nTable 1, the TIS system is designed for dual applications of high-resolution panchro-\nmatic (PAN) imaging and hyper-spectral (HS) imaging. The ground sample distance\n(GSD) at 470 km altitude is 5 m for a PAN and 15 m for HS imaging channels. The\nspectral band range is from 450 to 890 nm and the spectral resolution is less than\n10 nm for HS channels. The number of HS channels is more than 40.\n\nTable 1 Key features of TIS\n1st prototype model Clear Aperture Size 120 mm\n\nNumber of Imaging channels PAN 1\nHS ? 40\n\nGSD (m) @ 470 km PAN 5 m\nHS 15 m\n\nSwath width @ 470 km ? 40 km\nMTF (%) PAN ? 10\n\nHS ? 20\nSpectral Range PAN 500 ? 700 nm\n\nHS 450 ? 890 nm\nSpectral Resolution for H-ch ? 10 nm\nDimension 600mm \u00d7 400mm \u00d7 400mm\nWeight ? 15 kg\n\n\n\nDevelopment of a High-Performance Optical System for Small Satellites 91\n\nFig. 1 Front view of 1st TIS\nTelescope\n\nFig. 2 Exploded view of 1st\nTIS Telescope\n\nThe box-type structure of the TIS system is based on honeycomb panels with\ncomposite face-sheets designed to minimize mass and to have enough stiffness.

To minimize the manufacturing\ncost and to make the alignment process simpler, the secondary mirror of the TIS\nsystem is an on-axis spherical mirror and the tertiary mirror has a small deviation\nfrom a spherical surface.\n\nThe primary mirror has a hyperbolic surface of conic constant of about ?1.3 and\nthe tertiary mirror has an oblate elliptical surface of conic constant of about 0.2.\n\n\n\nDevelopment of a High-Performance Optical System for Small Satellites 93\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n10.0 20.0 30.0 40.0 50.0 60.0 70.0 80.0 90.0 100.0\nSPATIAL FREQUENCY (CYCLES/MM)\n\n X\n\n Y\n\nTHIS Model I 462\n\nDIFFRACTION MTF\n\nYWC\n\nDIFFRACTION LIMITY\nX (0.000,0.000) DEG\nY\nX (2.500,0.000) DEG\nY\nX (0.000,0.500) DEG\nY\nX (2.500,0.500) DEG\nY\nX (0.000,-0.50) DEG\n\nWAVELENGTH\n700.0 NM\n660.0 NM\n500.0 NM\n\nDEFOCUSING 0.00000\n\nM\nO\nD\nU\nL\nA\nT\nI\nO\nN\n\n20-Apr-07\n\nWEIGHT\n1\n1\n1\n\n54% for Polychromatic MTF\n@ 100 cy/mm\n\nFig. 5 MTF estimation for PAN band\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n4.0 8.0 12.0 16.0 20.0 24.0 28.0 32.0 36.0 40.0\n\nSPATIAL FREQUENCY (CYCLES/MM)\n\nX\nY\n\nTHIS Model I 462\n\nDIFFRACTION MTF\n\nYWC\n\nDIFFRACTION LIMITY\nX (0.000,0.000) DEG\nY\nX (2.500,0.000) DEG\nY\nX (0.000,0.500) DEG\nY\nX (2.500,0.500) DEG\nY\nX (0.000,-0.50) DEG\n\nWAVELENGTH\n890.0 NM\n660.0 NM\n500.0 NM\n\nDEFOCUSING 0.00000\n\nM\nO\nD\nU\nL\nA\nT\nI\nO\nN\n\n20-Apr-07\n\nWEIGHT\n1\n0\n0\n\n76.5% @ 890 nm\nand 40 cy/mm\n\nFig. 6 MTF estimation for 890 nm\n\n\n\n94 Y.-W. Choi et al.\n\nThese two mirrors are manufactured to have a surface quality of ?/17 rms and the\nsecondary mirror of ?/10 PV at ? of 632.8 nm.\n\nThe design MTF (modulation transfer function) is estimated to be more than 54%\nat 100 cycles per mm for the panchromatic band and is more than 76% at 40 cycles per\nmm for 890 nm. The design MTF at shorter wavelength is higher than that of 890 nm.\n\nTo predict the telescope performance, a tolerance analysis is performed in wave-\nfront error (WFE) and MTF. The tolerance analysis includes manufacturing, assem-\nbly, and alignment errors. The parameters used for the analysis includes the surface\nquality of mirrors. The analysis shows a wavefront error of 0.149 ? at the corner\nof the image plane and the panchromatic MTF of 34% in across-track and 32%\nin along-track direction at 100 cycles per mm. If the detector MTF is assumed to\nbe 45%, the TIS system will give MTF values of 15.3 and 14.4% in across and\nalong-track directions, respectively.\n\n3.2 Alignment of Optics\n\nThe alignment of the telescope started with the precision installation of the tertiary\nmirror (M3) with respect to the primary mirror (M1). From the tolerance analy-\nsis, the alignment result showed that the installation of M3 was successful within\n100 ?m for de-center and 10 arc-min for tilt.\n\nThe secondary mirror (M2) was aligned in two steps: coarse alignment and pre-\ncision alignment. The coarse alignment of M2 was performed with respect to M1\nusing CMMs (coordinate measurement machines) and alignment telescopes. CMMs\nwere used to correct the M2 de-center and de-space and alignment telescopes to\ncorrect the M2 tilt. It is estimated that the coarse alignment of M2 was successful\nwithin 50 ?m for de-center and 5 arc-min for tilt.\n\nYWC\n\nTHIS Model I 462\n\nTolerance Analysis\n\nRMS Wavefront Error\n\nC\nu\nm\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \np\nr\no\nb\na\nb\ni\nl\ni\nt\ny\n \n(\n%\n)\n\nF1:\nF2:\nF3:\nF4:\nF5:\nF6:\nF7:\nF8:\nF9:\n\n0.149 ? @ 632.8 nm\n(mirror quality sacrificed\n\nfor demonstration)\n\n100.\n\n90.\n\n80.\n\n70.\n\n60.\n\n50.\n\n40.\n\n30.\n\n20.\n\n10.\n\n0.\n0.000 0.033 0.066 0.098 0.131 0.164\n\n20-Apr-07\n\nFig. 7 WFE prediction for secondary mirror alignment\n\n\n\nDevelopment of a High-Performance Optical System for Small Satellites 95\n\nModulation Transfer Function\n\nF1: 100.00 c/mm, rad\nF2: 100.00 c/mm, rad\nF3: 100.00 c/mm, rad\nF4: 100.00 c/mm, rad\nF5: 100.00 c/mm, rad\nF6: 100.00 c/mm, rad\nF7: 100.00 c/mm, rad\nF8: 100.00 c/mm, rad\nF9: 100.00 c/mm, rad\n\n34% with 2 sigma\n@ 100 cy / mm\n\n(mirror quality sacrificed\nfor demonstration) \n\nYWC\n\nTHIS Model I 462\n\nTolerance Analysis\n\nC\nu\nm\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \np\nr\no\nb\na\nb\ni\nl\ni\nt\ny\n \n(\n%\n)\n\n100.\n\n90.\n\n80.\n\n70.\n\n60.\n\n50.\n\n40.\n\n30.\n\n20.\n\n10.\n\n0.\n0.802 0.965 0.587 0.479 0.371 0.263\n\n20-Apr-07\n\nFig. 8 MTF prediction for PAN in across-track direction\n\nModulation Transfer Function\n\n32% with 2 sigma\n@ 100 cy / mm\n\n(mirror quality sacrificed\nfor demonstration) \n\nYWC\n\nTHIS Model I 462\n\nTolerance Analysis\n\nC\nu\nm\nu\nl\na\nt\ni\nv\ne\n \np\nr\no\nb\na\nb\ni\nl\ni\nt\ny\n \n(\n%\n)\n\n100.\n\n90.\n\n80.\n\n70.\n\n60.\n\n50.\n\n40.\n\n30.\n\n20.\n\n10.\n\n0.\n0.763 0.659 0.555 0.450 0.346 0.242\n\n20-Apr-07\n\nF1: 100.00 c/mm, tan\nF2: 100.00 c/mm, tan\nF3: 100.00 c/mm, tan\nF4: 100.00 c/mm, tan\nF5: 100.00 c/mm, tan\nF6: 100.00 c/mm, tan\nF7: 100.00 c/mm, tan\nF8: 100.00 c/mm, tan\nF9: 100.00 c/mm, tan\n\nFig. 9 MTF prediction for PAN in along-track direction\n\nFor the precision alignment of M2, a computer-aided alignment (CAA) based on\nthe Zernike sensitivity was planned but it was not successful.

Fernandez-Saldivar, Craig I. Underwood, and Stephen Mackin\n\nAbstract The Ozone Layer Monitoring Experiment (OLME) on board the FASAT-\nBravo microsatellite, launched in July 1998, observed backscattered UV to retrieve\ntotal atmospheric ozone concentrations using two instruments: the Ozone Ultra-\nviolet Backscatter Imager (OUBI) and Ozone Mapping Detector (OMAD). Initial\nresults from this experiment have shown good qualitative agreement with NASA\u2019s\nTotal Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) [1]. Recent studies on OMAD and\nTOMS data found quantitative agreement in the radiances and indicated the de-\ntection of the volcanic eruption plume of Nyamuragira volcano (due to its sulphur\ndioxide content) [2].\n\nA new analysis of OMAD data using an improved version of the simplified al-\ngorithm to find ozone content has been developed and tested. Multiple days were\nanalysed using composites of up to 15 days and ozone contents ranging from 150\nDU to 400 DU. Recent findings indicate a relative error of between 3\u201310% in the\nvertical column content of ozone given in Dobson Units (DU) when compared with\nTOMS-Earth Probe data, depending on the geographical area analysed from the\ntropics to mid-latitudes.\n\nThe results obtained are in good agreement overall, despite the instrumental\ndifferences between OMAD and TOMS. The potential of small satellites for at-\nmospheric missions is discussed, including factors to consider when planning such\nmissions.\n\nJ.A.

Fernandez-Saldivar et al.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn 1994, a collaborative programme was set up between the University of Surrey and\nthe Chilean Air Force (FACH), to design and build a low-cost 50 kg micro-satellite\nwith instrumentation capable of monitoring the distribution and concentration of\nstratospheric ozone \u2013 particularly over Chilean territory. This resulted in the joint\ndesign and development of the Ozone Layer Monitoring Experiment (OLME) which\nwas flown on-board the resultant FASAT-Bravo micro-satellite, launched in July\n1998 into an 820 km altitude Sun-synchronous orbit. The experiment comprised two\nminiature low-cost instruments: the Ozone Ultraviolet Backscatter Imagers (OUBI),\nwhich used a UV-sensitive dye-coated CCD, and the Ozone Mapping Detector\n(OMAD), which is based on enhanced-UV-sensitive silicon photodiodes. The latter\nis a 4-channel radiometer with 10-nm resolution bands at 289, 313, 334 and 380 nm\nworking continuously with a Field of View (FOV) of 11? \u00d7 11? providing a ground\nresolution of approximately 150 \u00d7 150 km. Each channel uses a single fused silica\nanti-reflection coated lens with a focal length of 12.5 mm and an F-number of 1.1.\nThe signals are sampled continuously to12-bit resolution, and the entire instrument\ndraws only 500 mW when in operation [1].\n\n2 Methodology\n\nThe new algorithm obtains empirical factors to derive the total ozone content in the\nvertical column from the un-calibrated slant column content of the original algo-\nrithm. In order to minimise retrieval errors, the factors are derived by restricting the\nreflectance conditions to 20%, thus ignoring cloudy scenes. Once the factors are\nderived these are applied to all cloud conditions where we are aware of the errors\nin determining the ozone content below clouds due to their properties: height and\nthickness. Tropospheric ozone under the cloud can reach up to ?20 DU according\nto TOMS v.8 L2 products and [2]. The expected errors after the retrieval should be\nwithin this error range.\n\n2.1 Reflectivity\n\nThe first step in filtering out cloudy scenes requires knowledge of the surface re-\nflectance. The 380 nm surface reflectivity is low (2\u20138 %) over most surfaces, water\nand land, the observed reflectivity changes are mostly caused by changes in the\namount of snow/ice, cloudiness, and aerosols [3, 4]. Reflectivity is then derived\nthrough vicarious calibration between reflectivity data from the TOMS 360 nm\nchannel and the OMAD 380 nm channel, based on radiometric calibration from [5]\nonce the data has been referenced to a common grid (0.125? longitude \u00d7 0.1?\nlatitude).\n\n\n\nComparison of Atmospheric Ozone Measurements 103\n\nOnce OMAD\u2019s reflectivity or albedo is determined, we observe a good linear\nrelation when this is plotted versus TOMS\u2019 reflectivity; their cross-correlation is\nhigh. The 1-sigma absolute reflectivity error of TOMS minus OMAD reflectivities\nis in the range between ?3 % at the Equator to ?8 % near the Poles. This is shown\nin Fig. 1 below for tropical regions based on 15 days of data taken in October 1998.\n\nFig. 1 Relation between OMAD albedo at 380 nm and TOMS reflectivity at 360 nm (left). Cross-\ncorrelation (centre) and absolute error (%) (right)\n\nDiscrepancies between the two may be explained by taking into account the dif-\nferences in their wavelengths and spectral bandwidth. Furthermore, the pixel sizes\nand time of overpass are different accounting for dissimilar cloud fractions covering\nthe scene. Finally aerosols would introduce another variation however those are ig-\nnored here. Reflectivity is not directly taken into account in the retrieval procedure\nbut it allows a selection of low cloud cover from where the empirical factors are\nderived thus the discrepancies just described do not affect the algorithm directly.\n\n2.2 Retrieval Algorithm\n\nThe new algorithm is applied to low reflectivity (<20 %) scenes representing low\nor cloud free conditions. Figure 2 shows 15 days of OMAD tracks that meet this\ncondition.\n\nFig. 2 Ground pixels with cloud fractions <20% between 15th\u201329th October 1998\n\nThe procedure to retrieve ozone total column content products is detailed below\nand consists of four basic steps. Firstly, we obtain a slant column amount based on a\n\n\n\n104 J.A. Fernandez-Saldivar et al.\n\nlogarithmic ratio between two OMAD channels (334-nm and 313 nm). Secondly the\ngeometrical observing conditions are taken into account with the solar zenith angle,\nthis is known as geometrical air mass factor and is then subtracted in its logarithmic\nform from the slant column. Finally the empirical factors convert this un-calibrated\nvertical column into a real vertical column content. The algorithm works as follows:\n\nThe un-calibrated slant column amount is derived from the initial simplified al-\ngorithm based on the estimated radiance from two channels (L334 and L313).\n\nuO3Slant = Log(L334/L313) (1)\n\nIt is then corrected using a Geometrical Air Mass Factor (GAMF) based on the solar\nzenith angle (? ) given the observing conditions defined as:\n\nGAMF = 1/cos(? ) (2)\n\nFrom (1) and (2), we obtain a representative value of the vertical ozone content\nOMADO3.\n\nOMADO3 = uO3Slant ? Log(GAMF) (3)\n\nIn order to obtain the real vertical column content from (3) we used an empirical\nlinear function based on geographical zones\n\nO3vertical = Mzone ? OMADO3 + Bzone (4)\n\nWhere, Mzone is the empirical slope factor for given zone\nBzone is the empirical intercept factor for given zone\n\nThese two empirical factors allow us to account for various aspects: the most\nimportant is due to variations in ozone profiles that normally change with latitude;\natmospheric profiles of temperature and pressure also vary with geography and\ncontinental/ocean masses. Other aspects include: the different spectral resolution of\nOMAD, (10 times wider than TOMS-EP) and its ground sample area (also 10 times\nlarger than TOMS) and the fact that OMAD is nadir-only viewing, whilst TOMS\nscans across-track, which also affects the air mass factor.\n\n3 Empirical Function\n\nTwelve regions were defined for analysis based mainly on solar angle conditions and\ngeographical zones. Even though it seems a rather arbitrary designation, the purpose\nis to have multiple reduced datasets with similar ozone profile and content for each\nzone. This consideration also excludes the latitudes closer to the poles since these\nareas have the most extreme conditions on solar angle, radiance values and ozone\n\n\n\nComparison of Atmospheric Ozone Measurements 105\n\ncontent; polar regions would need a different analysis. The evaluated regions are\nillustrated in Fig. 3 showing a monthly ozone climatology of the average column\ncontent during the period under analysis (October 1998).\n\nFig. 3 Ozone content average October 1998\n\nThe factors for the empirical function described in (4) are obtained by analysing,\non various days, the linear relation between the OMAD representative value of\nozone content given by (3) and TOMS total ozone column content from version\n8 of the processing algorithm.\n\nThe scatter plot OMAD vs TOMS and a linear fit with 5% error bars are shown in\nFig. 4 for various days obtaining the corresponding daily Mday and Bday parameters.\nAll analysed days show a similar linear trend and most data points fall within the\n5% error for the daily fit. However, it is desired to have single linear parameters\nM and B that would apply to all days, these will be the final empirical parameters\ndescribed in (4).\n\nFig. 4 Linear fits for days under analysis with their M and B parameters\n\nFor the complete dataset of all zones and all days, the M and B parameters were\nobtained. The temporal and regional dimensions were analysed considering the vari-\nations of these parameters represented in the contour maps shown in Fig. 5.\n\n\n\n106 J.A. Fernandez-Saldivar et al.\n\nFig. 5 (left) M factor and B factor (right) for days vs zones\n\nThe lowest M parameters (?100) are centred on equatorial regions and they reach\nthe maximum of (?400) in southernmost regions 11 and 12. This would be a rather\nlarge variation in slope (M) if we do not take into account that the intercept (B)\nparameter behaves somehow inversely having the lowest values (? ?200) in the\nsouthernmost regions. This is partly due to the fitting method resulting in certain\ncoupling between M and B; nonetheless this is useful for deriving the other by\nhaving defined one of them once proper relationship between them is identified.\n\nIn order to help the definition of regional parameters, the corresponding 1-sigma\nuncertainty estimates of each parameter the fit are included so that the best daily\nfits are weighted accordingly before obtaining their regional representatives for all\nthose days.\n\nFig. 6 (left) M factor and 1-sigma uncertainty of M factor (right) for the considered zones\n\nThe M parameter and its 1-sigma uncertainty for each day analysed are shown\nin Fig. 6 above. A trend is observed throughout the days indicating the validity of\nthe empirical parameters to represent each zone condition. The M-parameter trend\nis non-symmetrical with respect to the equator neither to the solar angle indicating\nthe different ozone profiles for each region. The sigma-M also shows a trend that\nis somehow symmetrical with respect to the equatorial zones except in the south-\nernmost regions where an ozone hole condition normally develops around this time\nof year.\n\n\n\nComparison of Atmospheric Ozone Measurements 107\n\nThe uncertainties of the fit are explained by the different conditions over the re-\ngions where the overpass occurred on a specific day. In order to get day-independent\nrepresentative regional parameters, an average of the M-parameter is obtained with\n10 out of 15 days when the uncertainty estimates are lowest; a representative value\nis then obtained and the B-parameter is derived from there through the coupling\nbetween them. Figure 7 below shows a linear relationship between these two pa-\nrameters for all zones.\n\nFig. 7 Linear relationship between M and B parameters for all zones\n\n4 Results\n\nOnce the empirical M and B parameters were obtained, these were then applied to\nall days under analysis for each zone taking into account all reflectances and not just\nthe ones <20% from where parameters were derived.\n\nAs an example, zone 7 shown in Fig. 2 is analysed below (Fig. 8) with its corre-\nsponding factors. On the left plot, data points are scattered but clustered around the\nfitted line mostly within the 5% error bars.

Knowing\nthat higher reflectances will introduce an error due to the unaccounted ozone below\nthe cloud, another analysis was carried out expecting the errors to be reduced as\nthe data points were constrained to reflectivities below 20%, 30%, 40% and 50%.\nThe parameters used are the same as before but the number of data points included\nvaries.\n\nTable 1 shows the results of the four different reflectance limits considered and\nthe empirical factors used.

These figures are in agreement\nwith the typical amounts of ozone in the troposphere below the cloud mentioned in\nsection 2. On the other hand, the relative 1-sigma errors drop from ?10% for the\nunconstrained case to 2.9% for the lowest reflectivity constraint.\n\n5 Conclusions\n\nThe new algorithm under development, despite the rather large and inhomogeneous\nzones, offers a significant improvement over its predecessor thus extending the pre-\nviously known capabilities of micro-satellites for atmospheric remote sensing. The\nerrors between OMAD and TOMS are explained by changes in real cloud frac-\ntion due to difference timing of overpasses and also the determination of ground\nreflectance for different viewing conditions.\n\n\n\nComparison of Atmospheric Ozone Measurements 109\n\nThe days and zones analysed here, even though they represent a relatively narrow\nwindow to observe the complex ozone dynamics, nevertheless provide an insight\ninto the processing required to obtain valuable scientific data at low-cost and without\nthe heavy computational burden required by recursive radiative transfer methods.\nBecause of the temporal variations of ozone, further analyses are required for other\nmonths and also polar regions need to be included in order to observe phenomena\nsuch as the known ozone hole development. This region is likely to need special\ntreatment due to the extremely low solar elevation angles encountered.\n\nAcknowledgement The authors would like to thank the Royal Academy of Engineering,\nCONACYT and SSTL for their financial support.

Court\n\nAbstract To go beyond the point where micro satellites are seen as a way to qualify\ntechnology for use on a \u201creal\u201d satellite, small instruments are needed that can perform\na socially or scientifically significant task. MIBS is a spectrometer operating in the\nthermal infrared wavelength region, designed in the frame of the phase A study for the\nESA EarthCARE mission, which uses an uncooled 2D microbolometer array detector\ninstead of the more common MCT detectors, which allows for a significant reduction\nin size, and power consumption. Although the detectivity of microbolometers is less\nthen for MCT detectors, they offer specific advantages due to the wider wavelength\nresponse, which can be tailored to suit the application. This allows the design of an\ninstrument that can image both the 3 . . . 5 and 8 . . . 12 micron bands simultaneously,\nand which can be seen as an instrument that can be used to assist in weather prediction\nduring everyday use (its original goal) and in addition be used for forest fire detection\nand monitoring. In order to demonstrate feasibility of the concept a breadboard has\nbeen designed and built of which the first measurement results are presented here.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe microbolometer spectrometer is a prism spectrometer that uses a combination\nof reflective optics and a high speed camera in order to obtain an as high as possible\nNETD.

Leijtens et al.\n\nFig. 1 Principle optical\ndiagram of MIBS\n\nThe nadir view is looking down in this picture, and the incoming radiation is de-\nflected by TFM1 to the collimator TPM1 which focuses on the slit via compensation\nmirror SFM1. The slit image is again formed into a collimated beam via compen-\nsation mirror SFM2, foldmirror SFM3. collimation mirror CPM1 and foldmirror\nCFM1. The radiation is then dispersed by the prism and imaged on the detector\nvia Germanium lenses L1 and L2. TFM1 is the calibration mirror which is used to\npoint at either one of two blackbody\u2019s incorporated in the design or the scene. For\nthis purpose the mirror of the MIBS breadboard can be rotated by means of a small\nstepper motor.\n\nGiven the close proximity of the parts CFM1, SFM1, slit and SFM2 (and the\ndesire to assemble the entire system on basis of manufacturing tolerances as much\nas possible) a single mechanical assembly is created out of these parts. This so called\nslit assembly (Fig. 2) is used as the starting point of the alignment procedure.\n\nFig. 2 Slit assembly\n\n\n\nSerious Microsats Need Serious Instruments, MIBS and the First Results 113\n\nFig. 3 Alignment setup\n\nSubsequent mounting of SFM3 and CPM1 completes the installation of the col-\nlimating branch. Mounting of TPM1 and TFM1 completes the telescope branch.\nThe alignment of the optical parts is facilitated through the availability of wedged\nshims that allow to adjust the tilts of the components in an easy way and a number\nof dedicated alignment openings are provided in the housing in order to be able to\nmeasure the position of the optical components.\n\nSince the entire system up to the prism is reflective (with a transmissive slit) all\nof the measurements can be done using standard theodolites. During the assembly\nand alignment of the system it was proven that the alignment filosophy worked well\nin the sense that although additional shimming possibilities where provided, they\nwhere not needed during the alignment and all parts are mounted using manufactur-\ning tolerances and dedicated alignment shims only.\n\nThe camera assembly consists of the mount for the prism and the camera lenses.\nIt is a selfstanding assembly which is made of titanium in stead of the aluminium\nwhich is the base material for the rest of the instrument. (Fig. 4). Untill now no fur-\nther measurements have been made on this assembly with exception of the mounting\nposition of the prism.\n\nFig. 4 Camera assembly\nready for mounting\n\n\n\n114 J. Leijtens et al.\n\nThe camera assembly has dedicated heaters and temperature sensors in order\nto enable accurate temperature stabilization. This stabilization is required in case\nabsolute temperature measurements are to be made with the instrument. The need\nto stabilize the temperature is related to the absorbtion in the Germanium. Since\nthe absorbtion in the Germanium is less for lower temperatures, and the change in\nabsolute radiation in less for lower temperatures, there is a preference to operate\nthe optical bench at as low as possible temperatures in order to have an as high as\npossible absolute radiometric accuracy.\n\n2 Current Status\n\nThe MIBS breadboard has been assembled and is ready for the measurement and\nverification phase (Fig. 5). Since the setup has only been used to do NETD mea-\nsurements, the thermal control hardware has been mounted but has not yet been\noperated.\n\nFig. 5 MIBS in space\nincubator\n\n3 Measurements Performed\n\nSince the obtainable NETD is inherently lower when comparing a filter based in-\nstrument and a spectrometer, and absolute radiometric accuracy may be easier to\nobtain with a spectrometer, the prime focus for the measurements performed where\noptical alignment and NETD.\n\n3.1 Optical Measurements\n\nThe optical alignment went very well with the exception of mounting of the prism.\nThe rotation of the prism in its holder is slightly above spec (1, 3 mrad instead of\n1 mrad) which will potentially influence the co-registration for the end of swath.\nThis however is not considered to be a serious deviation and is left as is for the\n\n\n\nSerious Microsats Need Serious Instruments, MIBS and the First Results 115\n\nmoment. In case full performance is required in a later stage, this mis-alignment\ncan be solved through a more elaborate alignment procedure, but for the moment\nit is deemed more important to know what the deviation from nominal is, then to\nbe within the nominal tolerances as there are no real fixed requirements for the\nbreadboard and recalculation (with the actual values) will allow the correlation of\nreal life measurements with theoretical predictions.\n\nAs for the other optical tolerances everything else with exception of the nadir\npointing repeatability has been proven to be well within spec. The nominal opti-\ncal axis is positioned at 90 \u00b1 0.001 degrees with respect to the front face of the\ninstrument well within the 0.1 mrad requirement. The repeatability of the stepper-\nmotor used to rotate the calibration mirror however has been proven to be within\n0.08 degrees, the 0.08 degrees repeatability is less then required (0.14 mrad against\n0.1 mrad required) but this is not seen as a serious issue at this moment in time. The\nlower than required repeatability should be weighed against the need to design a\nnew calibration unit anyway in case the instrument is to be operated in vacuum. As\nall blackbodies used are oversized, the reduced repeatability is not seen as a serious\nconstraint for this stage of the project. The final alignment of the detector behind the\ncamera has not yet been performed because it was felt that a slight defocus would\nnot have dramatic effects on the NETD to be measured. Therefore, in order to find\nthe largest noise contributors and possible large deviations, we decided to do a set\nof preliminary NETD measurements.\n\n3.2 NETD Measurements\n\nUntil now, the NETD measurements have proven to be more difficult than the op-\ntical alignment. The first images produced gave us the confirmation that the optical\ncurvature correction seems to be working, (Fig. 6) but the measured NETD was\nabout a factor of two above the expected NETD and the camera was mounted in a\nfashion that caused all the data to be in the same column.\n\nFig. 6 Picture showing slit\nsignature at first light\n\nIn order to mitigate some of the column effects noticed during the first measure-\nments the camera was rotated so as to allow reference measurements to be taken in\n\n\n\n116 J. Leijtens et al.\n\neach column, and a calibration sequence was used, with a cold flat plate blackbody\nto calibrate gain and offset. The gain and offset uses a cold flat plate blackbody (at\nroom temperature) and another hot plate blackbody (at approximately 60 degrees. (it\nshould be noted that this will decrease the measured NETD due to the low effective\nemissivity of the blackbody(approx 0.9) with about 10%)\n\n3277\n\n6553\n\n9830\n\n13106\n\n16383\n\ncolumn position [pixel] column position [pixel]\n\nMean intensity of 199 \"cold\" frames\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200ro\nw\n\n p\nos\n\niti\non\n\n [p\nix\n\nel\n]\n\nro\nw\n\n p\nos\n\niti\non\n\n [p\nix\n\nel\n]\n\n250\n3277\n\n6553\n\n9830\n\n13106\n\n16383\nMean intensity of 199 \"hot\" frames\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nFig. 7 Temporal average of 199 frames of \u201ccold\u201d and \u201chot\u201d target\n\nAs can be seen in Fig. 7 there seem to be a number of pixels that give significant\ndifferences as compared to the rest.

This is in line with expectations and can be explained when looking at\nthe response of the microbolometer detector. The leading edge is determined by the\nlong wavelength response which gradually improves with decreasing Germanium\nabsorbtion. (Longer wavelengths are to the left) Shorter wavelengths will be trans-\nmitted by the high pass filter deposited on the detector window, and a combination\nof filter damping and decreased bolometer response cause the response to decrease\nfast with wavelength.\n\n3.3 Lower than expected NETD and way forward\n\nAs mentioned before, the measured NETD is currently about a factor 2 higher then\nexpected. This prompted some investigations aimed at providing additional insight\ninto the cause of the lower then expected NETD.\n\n\n\n118 J. Leijtens et al.\n\nDuring these investigations a number of contributors have been identified. Al-\nthough the investigations have not been exhaustive a good feeling has been devel-\noped regarding the optical throughput of the system.\n\nFirst of all the reflection of a spare mirror that was coated at the same time as the\nmirrors used in the breadboard was measured. The results of these measurements\nshowed the reflection to be less than presumed during the NETD calculations. The\naverage reflection at the wavelengths of interest proved to be only 96% whilst 98.5%\nwas anticipated. In first instance this may not seem to dramatic, but considering that\nthe beam passes 7 surfaces, the total system transmission is 0.75 in stead of 0.90\nwhich is more than 16% less.\n\nFurthermore during the initial measurements it was found that the intensity vari-\nations of the entire image are quite significant. When tracking the average intensity\nof the image over time, it can be seen (Fig. 10) that the variation is in the order of 16\nAD counts and drift is 8 AD counts. As compared to the signal found in Fig. 9 (40\nAD counts) this is considered very significant. Preliminary calculations have shown\nthat this effect has reduced the measured NETD by approximately 35%.\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200\n9580\n\n9582\n\n9584\n\n9586\n\n9588\n\n9590\n\n9592\n\n9594\n\n9596\n\n9598\nMean intensity evolution\n\nframe# [\u2013]\n\nm\nea\n\nn \nin\n\nte\nns\n\nity\n o\n\nf f\nra\n\nm\ne \n\n[\u2013\n]\n\nFig. 10 Changes in average level over time\n\nThe drift shown is more or less expected and is related to the temperature control\nof the detector and optical bench. The large fluctuations however were not directly\nexpected but may be related to some limit cycling in the thermal control hardware.\nFor normal imaging applications this will not be a real problem, but this becomes a\nsignificant effect for the spectrometer application where the input signal is reduced\n\n\n\nSerious Microsats Need Serious Instruments, MIBS and the First Results 119\n\ndue to the fact that the available signal is dispersed over a number of pixels. It is\nnot expected that this effect can be easily remedied for the breadboard, as it would\ninvolve interference with the thermal control hardware of the camera used.\n\nAnother significant contribution to the lower measured NETD is the EMC prob-\nlems that are currently experienced. Most probably due to a parasitic groundloop,\nthe image is disturbed by a moire? patern. (Fig. 11) This patern disturbs the measure-\nments and should be accounted for during the NETD measurements.\n\nDeviation of first frame from average of 200 consecutive frames\n\ncolumn position [pixel]\n\nro\nw\n\n p\nos\n\niti\non\n\n [p\nix\n\nel\n]\n\n50 100 150 200 250 300 350\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nFig. 11 Deviation of first \u201ccold\u201d frame from time-averaged mean\n\nIn order to estimate the obtainable performance without this interference, a 2D\nFFT of the images was taken and the higher order components removed. This leads\nto a considerably improved image quality (Fig. 12) and NETD calculated with this\nimproved average where improved by 30% (although some artefacts still exist).\n\nThe performed exercises show that the measured NETD is above the expected\nNETD, but a number of contributors have been identified:\n\n? Poor quality of the blackbody used\n? Lower then expected reflection of mirrors\n? High average image intensity variations\n? EMC disturbance\n\n\n\n120 J.

Furthermore a number of potentially relevant issues have not been\nspecifically investigated yet.\n\n? Absorption in the Germanium lenses of the camera\n? Effects of defocus on NETD\n\nFurthermore until now the TNO approach of designing an instrument that can be\nassembled for the majority based on manufacturing tolerances (largely decreasing\ncosts for assembly and alignment) has proven to be working for as far as measure-\nments have been performed. This will lead to an instrument that can be manufac-\ntured and aligned at a competitive price. During this year TNO will continue with\nthe characterization of the MIBS breadboard and further results can be expected in\nthe course of this year.\n\n\n\nSession 4\nConstellations\n\n\n\nFeasibility of a Constellation of Miniature\nSatellites for Performing Measurements\nof the Magnetic Field of the Earth\n\nMichael Thomsen, Jose? M. G. Merayo, Peter Brauer, Susanne Vennerstr\u00f8m,\nNils Olsen, and Lars T\u00f8ffner-Clausen\n\nAbstract This paper studies the requirements for a small constellation of satellites\nto perform measurements of the magnetic field of the Earth and a payload and boom\ndesign for such a mission is discussed. After studying communication, power and\nmass requirements it is found that it is feasible to develop a 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 30 cm3\nsatellite with a mass of about 2.5 kg, which can fulfill such a mission. We also study\nthe feasibility of controlling a constellation of such small satellites by means of air\ndrag by extracting one or more flaps. It is found that it is indeed possible, but for\nbest performance it is limited to altitudes around 450 to 550 km, depending on the\ntime of launch with regard to the solar sunspot cycle.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe dynamics and unpredictability of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field requires a continu-\nous mapping of Earth\u2019s magnetic field from space.

Unfortunately it is still expensive to integrate and launch large\nsatellites. Instead this paper investigates the possibility of performing continuous\nmeasurements of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field \u2013 knowledge which is essential for many\npractical applications like navigation and exploration \u2013 with a small, low mass satel-\nlite concept, which can also be used as a pioneer platform for future deployments of\na nanosatellite fleet for other multipoint measurements missions.\n\n2 Scientific Objectives\n\nThe scientific objectives for the mission discussed in this paper are two-fold:\nGeopotential research and investigation of the solar wind interactions with the\nmagnetosphere.\n\nMagnetic field readings will allow for a determination of \u201cIGRF-type\u201d models of\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetic field (up to spherical harmonic degree of about n = 13). Due to\nthe lack of high-precision attitude data, only the magnetic field intensity will be used\nfor this purpose. The practical inversion of the ill-posed problem of determining a\npotential field from intensity measurements only can be solved by utilizing a-priori\ninformation on the location of the dip-equator (defined by the places on Earth\u2019s\nsurface where the magnetic field is purely horizontal). Mapping of Earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield requires knowledge of the exact position. The availability of GPS position mea-\nsurements for just a fraction of the time (e.g. one orbit/day) combined with models\nof the Earth\u2019s gravity field and air density allows determining position with an accu-\nracy of down to one hundred meters, sufficient to measure magnetic field intensity\nwith an accuracy of a few nT. Fortunately, along-track position errors result in much\nsmaller magnetic field errors compared to vertical and across track position errors.\n\nSolar wind interactions with the Earth magnetic field generates a number of dif-\nferent current systems in Earth\u2019s magnetosphere and ionosphere: Distant currents in\nthe outer magnetosphere, the magnetospheric boundary and the tail, the ring-current\nin the inner magnetosphere, currents flowing along field-lines from the outer magne-\ntosphere to the polar ionosphere close to the Earth and ionospheric currents flowing\nhorizontally in the polar ionosphere acting to close the field-aligned current loop.\nAll of these current systems will influence the magnetic field as measured by a\nlow Earth orbiting (LEO) satellite, and can therefore in principle be investigated\nby such. The current systems are highly dynamic, varying at a large range of time\nscales, partly due to the time variations of the solar wind and partly due to internal\nmagnetospheric and ionospheric dynamics.\n\nMeasurements of the time variations of the total magnetic field intensity at\nlow earth orbit can be used to investigate the magnetospheric currents and also\nthe ionospheric currents. During geomagnetic storms the magnetospheric ring-\ncurrent increase and act to decrease the magnetic field near the Earth. This means\nthat energetic particles trapped in the Earths radiation belts will be able to pene-\ntrate to lower altitudes, thereby endangering astronauts and spacecraft instruments.\n\n\n\nFeasibility of a Constellation of Miniature Satellites 125\n\nA detailed description of this magnetic field decrease, its spatial variation and rela-\ntionship to the solar wind, is therefore of high priority. The spatial variations can be\ninvestigated statistically by combining single satellite measurements with solar wind\ndata, or instantaneously by using multipoint measurements from widely separated\nspacecraft.\n\nA LEO satellite will pass through the field-aligned currents (FACS) in the upper\npolar ionosphere, and can be used to investigate time-variations in their structure\nand intensity, provided that the satellite attitude is stable during the passage. The\nstructure of the FAC\u2019s is known to be highly filamentary, but by using a single satel-\nlite it is not possible to distinguish spatial variations from time variations. Two or\nmore closely orbiting satellites can contribute significantly to our knowledge of the\nspace/time structure of FAC\u2019s.\n\n3 Requirements\n\nIn order to realize the science objectives the following is required:\n\n? Accurate clock (1 ms or better)\n? Inter satellite time synchronization (1 ms or better)\n? Accurate orbit determination (better than 0.5 km)\n? Attitude determination better than 1?\n? Near polar orbit\n? No magnetic contamination\n\nThe first 3 requirements can easily be fulfilled with a GPS receiver, and the at-\ntitude can for the sunlit part of the orbit be determined using sun sensors. DTU\nhas developed some very small MEMS sun sensors providing accuracy better than\n1? [1], but commercial sun sensors with similar performance are also available, for\ninstance from AeroAstro [2]. During eclipse periods the attitude can be found using\na magnetometer. The last requirement is fulfilled by mounting the magnetometer on\na deployable boom and by designing the entire spacecraft with respect to a magnetic\ncleanliness program.\n\n4 Payload and Operations Description\n\nThe payload consists of two instruments: A miniature three axis fluxgate magne-\ntometer mounted on a boom and a GPS receiver. The current control electronics for\nthe magnetometer consists of one circuit board of 95\u00d748\u00d710 mm3. It features A/D\nconverters, voltage references, circuits to generate the necessary excitation currents\nfor the fluxgate magnetometer and a FPGA to control the system.\n\nThe magnetometer will be mounted in a carbon-fiber cylinder on the top of a short\nboom. A number of boom design options will be discussed in the following section.\nIt may be possible to mount MEMS sun sensors on the side of the magnetometer\n\n\n\n126 M. Thomsen et al.\n\nFig. 1 Miniature\nmagnetometer\n\nsensor. Likewise it is possible to mount a passive GPS patch antenna at the end of\nthe boom, but another location may be required in order to archive the best signal\nstrength.\n\nThe GPS receiver could either be embedded into the magnetometer FPGA, by\nadding an RF front-end to the design. Correlation and position calculations can\nbe done in the FPGA, possibly using a softcore microcontroller. Alternatively a\nseparate GPS unit can be used such as Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd\u2019s SGR-05U,\nwhich measures 70 \u00d7 45 \u00d7 10 mm3, has a mass of 20 g (excluding antenna) and\nconsumes 0.5 to 0.8 W at 5V [3].\n\nThe attitude does not need to be very well controlled, as long as the spacecraft\nis not spinning unreasonably fast. Since we are performing measurements of the\nmagnetic field, attitude control based on permanent magnets is not possible. On the\nother hand attitude control based on magnetorquers can be used but may only be\noperated at known intervals in order to correlate to the magnetometer data.\n\nIn order to control the distance between the two satellites in the constellation,\nflaps on the sides of the satellites can be extracted to increase the area facing the\nflight direction and therefore increase the air drag on one of the satellites, thus re-\nducing or increasing the inter-satellite distance. It should be noted that if this system\nis to be used the orbit must be reasonably low; otherwise the air density is too small\nto generate a sufficient drag, we will look further into this issue in a later section.\n\nTo minimize the power consumption, it may be desirable to only operate the GPS\nreceiver part of the time. One scenario would be to operate the GPS receiver for one\norbit per day. On board (and later ground) propagation of the GPS data can later be\nused to determine the position accurately.\n\n5 Boom Design\n\nFor a mission performing precise measurements of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field it is\nnecessary to place the magnetometer some distance away from the spacecraft in or-\nder to minimize the noise from the satellite body. For the small spacecraft proposed\nhere a required boom length has been estimated to about 25 cm. Three different\ndesigns are considered: A telescopic boom made from carbon fiber, a miniature\nversion of the \u00d8rsted satellite boom, and a fixed carbon fiber boom which does not\nrequire deployment mechanisms, but requires a larger area and may have issues with\nregard to vibrations during launch. The two deployable designs are shown mounted\non a cubesat on the illustration below. Both designs will be stowed in the spacecraft\nduring launch and will be deployed by releasing a locking mechanism.\n\n\n\nFeasibility of a Constellation of Miniature Satellites 127\n\nFig. 2 Cubesats (10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 cm3) with two different deployable boom designs (left: Miniature\n\u00d8rsted boom; right: Telescopic boom)\n\nThe telescopic boom will consist of 4 elements that will be deployed by a strong\nspring. A slightly conical design of the cylinder elements will ensure the rigidity\nand stability of the boom in the deployed position.\n\nThe \u00d8rsted boom consists of three 1 \u00d7 1 mm2 longerons made of an epoxy/fiber\nglass compound. They are fixed at the bottom of the well in the satellite, and\nmounted through hinges on the top mercedes-structure of the boom. The longerons\nare very flexible allowing the complete structure to be stowed in a very small space.\nThe spring-like properties of the longerons ensure that the boom will be unfolded to\na fairly rigid structure, although the carbon fiber boom will be more rigid it also has\na higher mass.\n\n6 Communication\n\nThe magnetometer can be used in several different modes, some that are interesting\nfor a mission like this are:\n\nMode Resolution @ Frequency Scalar measurements Vector measurements\n\nBurst 20 bit res @ 50 Hz 3042 bytes/min 9046 bytes/min\nNominal 22 bit res @ 10 Hz 642 bytes/min 1846 bytes/min\nHigh-res 24 bit res @ 1 Hz 102 bytes/min 226 bytes/min\n\nThis amount of data includes magnetic measurements, house keeping data (2 tem-\nperatures and 2 voltages), status information, a time stamp and protocol overhead.\nThe calculations are based on the ESA ECSS-E-70-41A protocol, packet size equals\none minute of measurements, and data compression is utilized. However for vector\nmeasurements attitude information is required, which is not included in the data\ncalculations. Note that data compression based on offset/deltas requires that the\nspacecraft is not spinning too fast. The GPS has been estimated to generate less\nthan 1 kB per 10 minutes, including protocol overhead.\n\n\n\n128 M. Thomsen et al.\n\nDepending on the orbit of the satellite the window for communication varies\ndrastically. Simulations using STK based on a sun synchronous orbit and a minimum\nelevation angle of 10 degrees result in the following windows for a ground station\nat the same latitude as Copenhagen (55.4?N):\n\nAltitude 450 km 650 km 850 km\nCommunication Window 23 min/day 39 min/day 55 min/day\n\nConsidering 650 km altitude and allocating 75% of the downlink capacity to science\ndata, a TM link of 60 kbps is required to run the vector burst mode continuously.\nThis can be mitigated by using additional ground stations, or by choosing a location\nat higher latitude. It may be better to reduce the amount of data, and thus reduce\nthe amount of power required to transmit the data. This can be done by operating in\nvector burst mode only part of the time, for instance when a magnetic pole is passed,\nwhich allows for study of the field aligned currents. Scalar measurements are fine\nfor the magnetic mapping campaign.\n\nBy selecting a TM link of 19200 bps, an average downlink window of 39 minutes\nper day and allocating 75% of the downlink capacity for the payload results in the\npossibility of transferring just over 4 Mb per day. This means that the magnetometer\ncan be operated for the following durations:\n\nMode Resolution @ Frequency Scalar measurements Vector measurements\n\nBurst 20 bit res @ 50 Hz 23 hours/day 7.7 hours/day\nNominal 22 bit res @ 10 Hz 109 hours/day 38 hours/day\nHigh-res 24 bit res @ 1 Hz 688 hours/day 310 hours/day\n\n7 Budgets\n\nThe magnetometer chosen for this design analysis is the miniature DTU fluxgate\nsensor, which consists of a sensor mounted on a small boom and some control elec-\ntronics. The mass and volume of these components can be seen in Table 1. Power\nconsumption is up to 250 mW when operating at 50 Hz sampling rate.\n\nThe AeroAstro sunsensors have a mass of 36 g each, and does not consume any\npower. The GPS receiver data is based on the SSTL SGR-05, which consumes 0.5\nto 0.8 W. As explained earlier it is possible to reduce this power consumption by\noperating the GPS only part of the time.\n\nAssuming a 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 30 cm3 satellite body and 76 \u00d7 37mm2 solar cells 6 of\nsuch cells can be mounted on four sides. With an efficiency of 25% and a power\nsupply conversion and battery storage efficiency of 65%, the total output with the\nsun orthogonal on the cells is 3.7 W, which is sufficient to power the satellite and\ncharge the batteries after an eclipse period.\n\nAt worst case a satellite in LEO will be in the eclipse for 35 minutes of a\n98 minute orbit.

With current Li-ion technology this\nshould provide well over 10000 cycles, or more than 2 years of operation [4].\n\nThis analysis suggests that it is indeed possible to build a small satellite to mon-\nitor the magnetic field of the earth.\n\n8 Constellation Control\n\nBased on the above analysis a 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 30 cm3 satellite of 2.5 kg seems feasible to\nfulfill part of the mission. However to fulfill the entire mission two or more satellites\nare required in order to perform multipoint measurements of the magnetic field. Dur-\ning such a mission it will be useful to be able to control the distance between each\nsatellite. Typically this is done by means of propulsion systems, but here we will\nlook at the feasibility of controlling the intersatellite distance by utilizing airdrag.\n\nFor a LEO satellite the, although very thin, atmosphere brakes the satellite and\neventually causes reentry. Two satellites of equal mass orbiting at equal altitude\nbut with a different surface area of the satellite facing the forward direction will\nbe subjected to a different amount of drag, which will change the distance between\nthem. By mounting extractable flaps on the satellite it should therefore be possible\nto control the along-track distance between the satellites.\n\nThe density of the air at LEO depends on the amount of radiation from the sun,\nwhich follows an 11-year pattern related to the sunspot cycle. When the number\nof sunspots is high the solar radiation increases. This will heat the atmosphere of\nthe Earth, which will therefore expand and thus result in an increased density at a\ngiven altitude. This will cause increased drag so a satellite will deorbit faster during\n\n\n\n130 M.

The simplified model used for this analysis takes this 11-year so-\nlar sunspot cycle into consideration. Figure 3 shows how the air density at 550 km\naltitude varies over time according to the model.\n\nThe lifetime of a LEO satellite is therefore dependent on the time of launch, since\nit may deorbit sooner if launched near solar maximum than near a solar minimum.\nFigure 4 shows how fast a 10 \u00d7 30 cm2 forward facing, 2.5 kg satellite will deorbit\nif launched around solar maximum (January 1st, 2011) and solar minimum, around\nJanuary 1st, 2015.\n\nIt can be seen that when launched to 550 km near solar maximum we can expect an\norbital lifetime of close to two years (blue line), while if launched to 450 km near solar\nminimum, we can expect almost twice as long before the satellite deorbit (blue line).\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nDays after January 1st, 2011\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\nw/solar cycle\nSolar min\nSolar max\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\nDays after January 1st, 2015\n\nw/solar cycle\nSolar min\nSolar max\n\nFig. 4 Altitude characteristics of similar (mass, volume) satellite launched near maximum sunspot\nactivity (left) and near minimum sunspot activity (right)\n\n\n\nFeasibility of a Constellation of Miniature Satellites 131\n\nTable 2 Along track difference between one 10 \u00d7 30 cm2, 2.5 kg satellite and one 20 \u00d7 30 cm2,\n2.5 kg satellite at various altitudes\n\nAltitude (km) Along track difference (m) after one orbit\n\n2011 launch 2015 launch\n\n400 166 38.4\n450 79.7 14.8\n500 39.9 6.1\n550 20.6 2.7\n600 11.0 1.3\n650 6.0 0.7\n700 3.4 0.4\n\nTable 3 Along track difference between one 10 \u00d7 30 cm2 satellite and one satellite with flaps of\nvarying size, both satellites 2.5 kg\n\nSize of second satellite Along track difference (m) after one orbit\n\n2011 launch (550 km) 2015 launch (450 km)\n\n30 \u00d7 10 0 0\n30 \u00d7 15 10.3 7.4\n30 \u00d7 20 20.6 14.8\n30 \u00d7 25 30.9 22.2\n30 \u00d7 30 41.2 29.6\n\nNext we look at how much we can change the along-track difference by extract-\ning flaps which will double the area of one of the satellites. As can be seen from\nTable 2, during a solar maximum this will change the difference by 20.6 m per orbit\nat 550 km altitude. A value of similar magnitude is found for a 450 km altitude\norbit during solar minimum. If, on the other hand the satellites are launched to a\n550 km altitude orbit during solar minimum, the change in distance between the\ntwo satellites is only 2.7 m per orbit, which does not seem sufficient.\n\nTable 3 shows the along-track difference for satellites with different flap size.\nThe simulations suggest that it is indeed feasible to control inter-satellite distances\nof small spacecraft by means of air drag. It also shows that the launch altitude and\ntime with regard to the solar sunspot cycle are important factors for determination\nof mission lifetime and the time it takes to change the inter-satellite distance.\n\n9 Conclusion\n\nWe have here described the scientific objectives for a mission performing measure-\nments on the magnetic field of the earth. A mission that requires multiple simulta-\nneous measurements, which can be obtained by launching several small satellites.\nThe science payload along with a boom design, communication, power and mass\nbudgets are analyzed. It is shown that compact, low power hardware already exists\nto fulfill these requirements, and that a constellation of 2.5 kg 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 30 cm3\n\n\n\n132 M. Thomsen et al.\n\nsatellites can fulfill the mission. Finally it is shown that it is feasible to control the\nconstellation based on air drag, but for best performance it is limited to altitudes\naround 450 to 550 km, depending on the time of launch with regard to the solar\nsunspot cycle.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In fact, combination of signals\nfrom multiple coherent receivers allows to overcome intrinsic performance limita-\ntions of monolithic SAR systems. This paper deals with an overview of recent ad-\nvances and ideas in the field of distributed sparse/filled aperture radar concepts and\nrequired signal processing. Then, preliminary system considerations are given and\na preliminary conceptual analysis of a distributed P-band SAR is presented. At low\nfrequency distributed SARs offer greater advantages in overcoming the minimum\narea constraint (order of several tens of meters) and reduce the impact on formation\ncontrol feasibility (requirement depends on ?). A formation of 6 cooperating satel-\nlites carrying a 2 m \u00d7 2 m antenna operating at an undersampling pulse repetition\nfrequency of 1000 Hz would allow to achieve 1 m azimuth resolution (ionospheric\neffect not included) over the whole range swaths.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn the last decades, spacecraft mass and power have been reduced to limit costs and\nrisks leading to shorter development time, possibility to fly up-to-date technology,\nand frequent re-flight. The possibility to use coordinated systems of platforms instead\nof a large single spacecraft has been introduced. Not only can a system of platforms\nreplace a monolithic system, but it has also the capability of realizing performance\notherwise unachievable. New technology plays a fundamental role in enabling high\nperformance, which are required to implement new missions based on distributed\nsystems: near term developments involve microtechnology, while nanotechnology\nimpacts far term goals.\n\nM.

Fasano\n\nThere seems to be a high degree risk in developing formation-based missions.\nNevertheless, formation concept is widely considered as a unique tool to perform\nmissions otherwise impossible and has been recognized as an enabling technology\nby NASA and U.S. Air Force. A number of space missions are under development\nwhich, in full or in part, make use of the formation concept: Earth Orbiter, Space\nTechnology 3, Space Technology 5, Starlight by NASA; the American University\nNanosatellites Program, which is based on several nanosatellites developed by sev-\neral American Universities under private and public sponsorships; Cluster, Darwin,\nand Smart-2 by ESA; LISA jointly by NASA and ESA; TechSat21 by the Air Force\nResearch Laboratory.\n\nThe first applications of formations were proposed by astronomers to obtain op-\ntical interferometry able to cancel out star light in order to identify distant planets,\nwhich imposes very demanding (nm order) requirement on satellite relative position\nknowledge and control [1]. To identify mission scenarios for future Earth observa-\ntion missions, let us schematically consider near, mid, and far term time frames and\ndefine the following wording: (A) a \u201cformation\u201d is a system of at least two platforms\nwhere relative motion must be at least measured by at least one of the formation\nspacecrafts (that is to say, at least one spacecraft integrates a metrology subsystem);\n(B) a \u201cformation mission\u201d is flown by a formation and payloads on-board different\nspacecrafts are used in synergy to derive new data (thus, new data are generated by\ncombination of data from different payloads); (C) a \u201cdistributed mission\u201d is flown\nby a formation and the payload itself is split over the different platforms (a single\npayload on a single spacecraft is practically useless: mission data are only obtained\nby on-board combination of data from different platforms). Thus, missions where\ndifferent spacecrafts only contribute to enhance space and time distribution of gath-\nered data (constellations) are not considered. It is worth underlining that formations,\nformation missions, and distributed missions pose incrementally challenging issues.\n\nFormation missions exploiting microwave Earth remote sensing are already un-\nder development: SABRINA in Italy and Tandem-X in Germany. SABRINA [2]\nis scheduled for 2011 and it will perform Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry\n(InSAR) and large baseline Synthetic Aperture Radar bistatic acquisitions (BSAR)\nby two SARs flying on a non-cooperative COSMO satellite and on an additional\nsatellite (BISSAT). Tandem-X [3, 4] is due for launch in 2009 and will perform\nInSAR by two cooperative TerraSAR-X satellites.\n\nOther missions bearing similarities with SABRINA and Tandem-X had been pro-\nposed in [5, 6] in the framework of the TOPSAT project. Then, it was proposed a\nsmall mission flying in formation with Envisat [7] and COSMO/Skymed [8, 9].\nIn addition, the cartwheel concept [10, 11] was introduced to perform InSAR by\nmicrosatellites flying in coordination with a large active SAR satellite.\n\nBesides InSAR and BSAR mission, SAR has been considered for other interest-\ning formation missions. TechSat21 [12], studied at US Air Force Research Labo-\nratory, integrated 5 lightweight SAR payloads on-board 5 lightweight spacecrafts\n(<100 kg), which were designed to fly at distances ranging from 100 m to about\n5 km [13]. One of the objectives of TechSat-21 was the assessment of space-based,\nsparse-array aperture used to synthesize a large radar antenna. In fact, the radars\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Future Earth Observation Missions Based on Distributed Radars 135\n\nwere designed to work in three modes [14, 15]: synthetic aperture radar imaging,\nmoving target indication, geo-location. TechSat21, though being a formation mis-\nsion, had working modes typical of distributed missions, with strong interactions\namong different payloads.\n\nReal breaking concepts for future remote sensing missions, including micro-\nwave Earth observation, rely on realization of large apertures, unachievable with\nstandard design technique and technology [16] but with massive use of micro/nano\ntechnologies.\n\nThe general goal of filled large aperture is simple in principle: bringing antenna\napertures form the order of magnitude of few to tens square meters to hundreds\nsquare meters or square kilometers. The concept of such systems does not dif-\nfer from standard system since there is a primary microwave mirror and a feed.\nNonetheless, implementation is substantially different because standard rigid or in-\nflatable structures have mass density well above what is needed to achieve feasi-\nble system masses. Thus, the primary mirror is realized by a thin film membrane\n(gossamer concept), non rigid in nature but assuming a prescribed figure thanks to\nan electron beam scanning its surface and commanding embedded actuators. The\nelectron beam generator (free flying spacecraft with loose orbit control) is activated\nby a free flying spacecraft (loose orbit control) which sense current figure of mem-\nbrane. Finally a free flying spacecraft carrying feed array is precisely station-kept\nwith respect to the mirror.\n\nThe concept of sparse aperture has its roots in the work on optical interferometry\nover one-hundred years ago and on the development of radio astronomy about half\ncentury ago [17]. The basic idea is not to use the overall aperture, rather it is seg-\nmented and only a sparse subset of segments are really implemented. If amplitude\nand phase are received from each segment Fourier inversion can be implemented\nreconstructing images of the observed target. A sparse radar aperture can be imple-\nmented with a swarm of simple, free flying antennas, which autonomously set their\ntime delay to compensate for different distance from target. In particular, free flyer\ncan be loosely controlled thanks to virtual control obtained by selectable delay lines.\nThe advantage of sparse arrays is that they can be virtually combined generating\ndifferent apertures and beam widths, multi-beam systems, different beam forms.\nOf course, such combination can be dynamically changed in orbit to realize a very\nversatile Earth observation system. Sparse aperture have been recently studied for\nmicrowave remote sensing [18].\n\nIn the following, the concept of distributed radar aperture is analyzed in further\ndetails and a potential mission is preliminarily highlighted.\n\n2 Rationale and Potential of Distributed Radar\n\nRecent research on distributed synthetic aperture radar systems is due to the neces-\nsity of overcoming intrinsic limitations of monolithic SAR systems. In particular,\nthe trade-off between swath width and azimuth resolution leads to the minimum\n\n\n\n136 M. D\u2019Errico, G. Fasano\n\nantenna area constraint if best possible resolution and widest possible swath are the\ndesign goals [19]. The minimum area constraint can be expressed as follows:\n\nA >\n4V?RStg?i\n\nc\n(1)\n\nwhere V is the satellite speed, ? is wavelength, ?i is the incidence angle, Rs is the\nslant range and c is the speed of light. It can be seen that minimum area increases\nfor increasing incidence angle and wavelength. In Fig. 1 minimum area is plotted as\na function of altitude and off-nadir angle. It is worth noting that for low frequency\nthe constraint is of the order of 100 m2. Smaller antennas can be built at the cost\nof worse azimuth resolution and/or smaller swath, but with degraded observation\npotential.\n\nTo overcome this constraint, multiple receiving channels are required to improve\nboth observed areas and spatial/temporal sampling. The first ideas in this frame-\nwork is referred to the possibility of using multi-channel SAR antennas [20, 21].\nThe same concept can be implemented by using a sparse set of coherent transmit-\nters/receivers [18]. A preliminary overview of techniques, potentials, and criticali-\nties of sparse SAR is given in [18, 22\u201324]. Multiple coherent receive apertures can\nbe used to improve illumination coverage while maintaining azimuth resolution. Il-\nluminated area is determined by size of individual antenna, while spatial information\nprovided by multiple antennas is used to resolve range-Doppler ambiguities. Since\nit is the sum of antenna areas that must satisfy minimum SAR antenna area con-\nstraint, each aperture can be smaller and illumination area can be improved over the\nsingle-receiver case by a factor equal to the number of receivers. It is interesting to\nnote that data from each satellite can be processed alone, accepting a reduced swath\nwidth and/or a worse azimuth resolution (processed Doppler bandwidth). Moreover,\nquality of single SAR images does depend on antenna dimensions which strongly\naffect SNR. However, it is the processing of all received echoes that enables high\nperformance. Nevertheless, a definitive solution for 3d, random array patterns is not\ngiven [18, 22\u201324]. Furthermore, it is worth noting that many receive apertures are\nnecessary in order to reduce array pattern sidelobe levels.\n\nFig. 1 Minimum area constraint for C (? = 6 cm) and P (? = 1 m) bands\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Future Earth Observation Missions Based on Distributed Radars 137\n\nMore recently, studies have been focusing on linear sparse arrays as a more\nimmediate solution for distributed SAR and GMTI systems. For example, Raman\net al. [25] demonstrate the possibility to suppress azimuth ambiguities for these\nconfigurations.\n\nSAR train concept [26, 27] is also proposed to solve the minimum antenna con-\nstraint by splitting a wider antenna over a given number of smaller antennas. A\nsimilar approach (multi-aperture azimuth sampling) is followed in [28, 29, 30] for\nthe proposed, virtually filled aperture. That is to say, that the SAR distributed system\nsimulates a virtual monostatic SAR antenna. N smaller antennas work at an under-\nsampling PRF, but signals acquired at different positions eventually by different\nantennas are coherently combined to gather the signal of the virtual antenna. Once\nthe virtual SAR signal is reconstructed, standard SAR processing can be applied.\n\n3 System Considerations\n\nSparse SAR systems performance rely directly on relative dynamics, platform syn-\nchronization and coordination. Thus, there is a close connection between payload and\nsystem design, which is an innovative aspect with respect to classical SAR missions.\nFurthermore, these systems can be operated in monostatic or bistatic modes (Fig. 2).\n\nV V\n\nFig. 2 Monostatic and bistatic distributed linear SAR systems (not to scale)\n\nIn monostatic distributed SARs, all the platforms are Tx/Rx. Since the antennas\nare small, they are characterized by large patterns and swaths. As a consequence,\ninterference among the different radars can be a problem. It can be avoided by differ-\nent approaches: (1) using large satellite separations (depending on frequency: hun-\ndreds of kilometers for P-band); (2) using slightly different Tx signals for the differ-\nent radars; (3) ad-hoc coding of Tx signals. Large separation among platforms poses\nmajor problems in knowledge and control of relative position and attitude. In fact,\nthe most precise metrology systems (lasers) can typically operate at short distances,\nwhereas differential GPS accuracy decreases for increasing satellites separation.\n\nAnother option is to acquire data in a bistatic configuration, with a separate\ntransmitter and all the other antennas working as receiving-only systems. Different\napproaches can be utilized to implement the system. A single, larger satellite could\nbe in charge for transmitting the radar signals, with lighter satellites as receivers. As\nan alternative, all satellites can be identical, but one at a time is used for transmission\nand transmission times per orbit are equally shared by different radars. With this\napproach, satellite orbit average power can be reduced and the formation is more\n\n\n\n138 M. D\u2019Errico, G. Fasano\n\nreliable since it does not depend on a single platform for operation. Peak power is\nnot relaxed.\n\nFrom a dynamics point of view, different constraints arise for monostatic and\nbistatic cases. In the first case, major effort is to control radar burst times among\ndifferent satellites order to achieve adequate and regular azimuth sampling (common\ntime reference probably mandatory). Whereas for bistatic solutions, it is necessary\nto control relative positioning up to ?-fraction, which is harder at higher frequencies.\nOn-going researches will probably allow to relax these requirements: algorithms\nfor azimuth signal reconstruction from non uniform samples [30] and auto-focus\ntechniques [28, 29].\n\nIt is worth noting that a sparse aperture gives more possibilities/flexibility with\nrespect to multi-channel systems implemented on a physical antenna (given distance\namong phase centers leads to given PRF). With a distributed radar, PRF can be\ndynamically selected in conjunction with a given satellite distance. Since required\nPRF depends on single antenna size and on number of flying antennas, this capabil-\nity allows an incremental development of the system with incremental achievement\nof performance. Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is a critical issue for small antennas.\nHowever, it is useful to remind that SNR for final SAR image not only depends on\nraw data SNR, but it is also related to range and azimuth oversampling factors. Thus,\nit is possible to enhance SNR increasing virtual PRF for a given Doppler bandwidth,\nwhich is obtained either increasing elementary radar PRF or the number of flying\nradars (or a combination of both). Approaching higher and higher PRF can again\nlead to ambiguity problem.\n\n4 Low Frequencies as a Test Case for Distributed Radars\n\nLow frequency (below L-band) radars have never been used in Earth observation\nspaceborne applications. This is mostly due to technological problems in realization\nof very large antennas, required to get adequate SNR and to avoid range/azimuth\nambiguities. Necessity of full polarization to remove ionospheric effects is another\nfactor that limits performance of classical SAR systems. Nevertheless, climatology\nand biosphere scientific community is in clear need of information which can only\nbe provided on a global scale by a spaceborne P-band SAR [32]. In fact, P-band\nbackscatter has been found to have a strong correlation with biomass in forested\nareas [33\u201335], allowing for global biomass measurements and realization of ac-\ncurate forest and deforestation maps. Furthermore, P-band capability to penetrate\nice can be used for Antarctica subsurface analyses which can have a great impact\non prediction of ice sheet dynamics and climate/sea level changes. Past studies in\nthis framework [36] showed that a nadir looking geometry is necessary to isolate\nthe return from subsurface ice layers removing surface echos. However, a multi-\nplatform approach allows to apply interferometric SAR, so that surface clutter can\nbe removed even in side-looking geometries [37].\n\nThus, a P-band distributed systems can be considered as a great scientific op-\nportunity, allowing for both biomass and glaciology studies. Furthermore, from the\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Future Earth Observation Missions Based on Distributed Radars 139\n\nengineering point of view, relative position knowledge and control requirements are\nrelaxed thanks to longer wavelength (?70 cm considering latest ITU allocation). To\nget preliminary quantitative insights, let us consider 2 m \u00d7 2 m P-band SAR anten-\nnas flying in along-track formation at an altitude of 550 km with off-nadir angles\nwithin 20\u201330?. Doppler bandwidth corresponding to the 3 dB azimuth aperture is\n6674.9 Hz, which lead to a minimum required PRF of about 8000 Hz (1.2 azimuth\nsampling factor). Since, cross-track swath is about 210 km, such a PRF would lead\nto range ambiguities. Maximum PRF required to avoid range ambiguities would\nvary from about 2100 Hz (at 20? off nadir angle) to about 1150 Hz (30? off nadir\nangle). Thus, there are two choices: reduction of elevation swath or reduction of\nazimuth swath (process a smaller Doppler bandwidth). The former approach leads\nto small imaged swaths, the latter one to reduced azimuth resolution. Utilizing more\nSARs allows to improve either range swath or processed bandwidth (or a combina-\ntion of both).\n\nChoice of PRF and distance among platforms depends on required performance.\nFigure 3 shows the potential of distributed SAR reporting unambiguous swath and\nachievable 1-look azimuth resolution as a function of PRF and number of satellites.\nOff nadir angle is selected at 25?, and it is supposed that maximum desired swath is\nthe one corresponding to 3 dB antenna aperture in elevation (this is why there is an\nupper limit for unambiguous swath). The performance improvement brought by an\nincreasing number of platforms is very considerable.\n\n500 1000 1500 2000\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nac\nhi\n\nev\nab\n\nle\n a\n\nzi\nm\n\nut\nh \n\nre\nso\n\nlu\ntio\n\nn \n(m\n\n)\n\n500 1000 1500 2000\n160\n\n170\n\n180\n\n190\n\n200\n\n210\n\n220\n\nPRF (Hz)\n\nun\nam\n\nbi\ngu\n\nou\ns \n\ngr\nou\n\nnd\n s\n\nw\nat\n\nh \n(k\n\nm\n)\n\n1 sat\n2 sats\n3 sats\n4 sats\n5 sats\n6 sats\n\nFig. 3 Unambiguous swath and 1-look azimuth resolution as a function number of satellites\n\n\n\n140 M. D\u2019Errico, G. Fasano\n\nFor the sake of clarity, le us underline that Fig. 3 represents limit cases in a\nsimplified scenario (for example, impulse duration is neglected), whereas in real\nsensor design PRF must be defined in order to obtain required low values for az-\nimuth and range ambiguity-to-signal ratios. It is also worth noting that Fig. 3 was\nobtained without considering full polarization. If this is the case, then for any given\nPRF achievable azimuth resolution doubles and the advantage of distributed sensor\napproach with respect to monolithic system design is more evident.\n\n5 Conclusions\n\nDistributed radars can in principle allow to overcome limitations of classical, mono-\nlithic radars. After an overview of current researches covering both sparse and filled\n(or virtually filled) radar apertures, an analysis has been presented in the case of\na low frequency (P-band) distributed SAR. In particular, if on the one hand SAR\nantennas should be as small as possible to improve azimuth resolutions, one the\nother hand they must be large enough to avoid ambiguities. Distributed SARs allow\nto overcome this limitations.\n\nReferences\n\n1. R.L. Duren and O.P. Lay, The Starlight Formation-Flying Interferometer System and Archi-\ntecture.

Merayo et al.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nHigh precision measurements of the geomagnetic field have been and are essential\nto provide insight into the internal structure of the Earth and the solar interaction\nwith the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. These measurements reveal the resulting magnetic\nfield that stems from the superposition of three sources: the core field, the crustal\nfield and the current driven field. The spatial and temporal structure of these sources\nare very different from each other, and therefore not only signal extraction methods\nand modelling but also measurement strategies have to be taken into account in\norder to successfully separate these signal contributors. Furthermore, this decom-\nposition process requires that the global field is known at any given time with a\nrelatively high accuracy, wherefore accurate magnetic field mapping is only viable\nusing spaceborne observations.\n\nThe data obtained from one single spacecraft is extremely valuable. The first mis-\nsion to ever map the Earth\u2019s magnetic field vector at LEO was the NASA MAGSAT\n(1978\u20139). Twenty years later, the Danish \u00d8rsted micro satellite (1999\u2013), the German\nCHAMP (2000\u2013), the Argentine SAC-C (2000\u20135) have been designed specifically\nfor mapping the LEO magnetic field. Common to these resent missions is the mag-\nnetometry package, which utilizes a vector field magnetometer co-mounted with a\nstar tracker (2 in the case of CHAMP) on an optical bench.\n\nAs the accuracy of the instrument package has constantly increased, as well as the\nmodelling methods have been improved towards optimized signal decomposition, it\nhas been realized that simultaneous data from several points in space is needed, if\nthe ultimate modelling barrier, the spatial-temporal ambiguity, has to be broken.\n\nThe ESA Swarm mission under the Living Planet Programme consists of three\nidentical spacecraft orbiting in near polar orbits with altitudes varying between\n400 km and 550 km. This constellation is to map the magnetic field of the Earth with\nunprecedented spatial and temporal accuracy. For this purpose, each spacecraft will\nbe equipped with a vector field magnetometer and three star trackers co-mounted in\nan optical bench, which will ensure 100% data coverage over the orbit with arcsec-\nond accuracy. This accuracy of the magnetometry package is essential for fulfilling\nthe mission objectives.\n\nThis paper describes the basic design characteristics and the performance poten-\ntials of the Swarm Magnetometry Package. The key performance parameter is an\nabsolute attitude recovery accuracy in the arcsecond range over time, temperature\nand aging. The methods used to achieve and validate this accuracy are discussed,\nas well as the potential for using this methodology on other future missions with\nextreme stability and accuracy demands.\n\n2 The Swarm Mission\n\nThe Swarm mission [1] was selected as the 5th mission in ESA\u2019s Earth Explorer Pro-\ngramme in 2004. The mission will provide the best ever survey of the geomagnetic\n\n\n\nThe Swarm Magnetometry Package 145\n\nFig. 1 Swarm constellation of three satellites\n\nFig. 2 Swarm satellite will be about 8 m long and have a weight of 300\u2013400 kg\n\nfield and its temporal evolution that will lead to new insights into the Earth system\nby improving our understanding of the Earth\u2019s interior and its effect on Geospace,\nthe vast region around the Earth where electrodynamic processes are influenced by\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Scheduled for launch in 2010, the mission will comprise\na constellation of three satellites, with two spacecraft flying side-by- side at lower\n\n\n\n146 J.M.G. Merayo et al.\n\naltitude (450 km initial altitude), thereby measuring the East-West gradient of the\nmagnetic field, and the third one flying at higher altitude (530 km). High-precision\nand high-resolution measurements of the strength, direction and variation of the\nmagnetic field, complemented by precise navigation, accelerometer and electric\nfield measurements, will provide the necessary observations that are required to sep-\narate and model the various sources of the geomagnetic field. This results in a unique\n\u201cview\u201d inside the Earth from space to study the composition and processes of its\ninterior. It also allows analysing the Sun\u2019s influence within the Earth system. In ad-\ndition practical applications in many different areas, such as space weather, radiation\nhazards, navigation and resource management, will benefit from the Swarm concept.\n\nThe research objectives of Swarm mission [2] are:\n\n\u2013 Related to the Earth\u2019s Interior:\n\n? Map the core flow\n? Determine core dynamics\n? Investigate jerks: their time-space structure and recurrence\n? Understand core-mantle coupling and its implication for Earth rotation\n? Perform 3D imaging of mantle conductivity\n? Determine remanent and induced magnetisation of the lithosphere\n\n\u2013 Related to the Earth\u2019s environment:\n\n? Determine the position and development of the radiation belts and their near-\nEarth effects\n\n?

I.e. in case of blinding of one of the star trackers due to the Sun or Earth being\non the field of view, two star trackers can deliver full accurate attitude. The blinding\nof two camera heads (by both Sun and Earth) at the same time is also possible but\nextremely rare. The optical bench temperature gradients as well as the time thermal\nvariation are designed to be as low as possible to minimize the potential effects that\ncan be difficult to model to the level of accuracy required, i.e. few arc seconds.\n\n3.1 Vector Field Magnetometer (VFM)\n\nThe Vector Field Magnetometer (VFM) from DTU is the prime instrument of the\nSwarm mission. It will provide ultra linear and low-noise measurements of the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field vector components. The VFM full-scale range is +/? 65 ?T\nand it has been allocated a measurement random error of less than 1 nT integrated\nover frequencies up to 4Hz.\n\nThe proposed VFM (fluxgate type) consists of a Compact Spherical Coil (CSC)\nsensor, non redundant, mounted on the deployable boom, an internally redundant\ndata processing unit (DPU) and the connecting harness.\n\nThe fluxgate magnetometer, which is based on the CSC (Compact Spherical Coil)\nsensor that exhibits extremely high directional linearity as well as thermal stability\n(30 ppm/C for the scale factors and very low for the non-orthogonal angles and off-\nsets).

Left: redundant electronics\nbox with Right: CSC sensor (shown with a CHAMP holder)\n\n3.2 The Absolute Scalar Magnetometer (ASM)\n\nThe objective of the Absolute Scalar Magnetometer (ASM) from LETI is to cali-\nbrate the vector field magnetometer (VFM) to maintain the absolute accuracy in the\nmulti-year geomagnetic field mission. The required main performance characteris-\ntics of the ASM are: absolute accuracy of < 0.3 nT (2? ), resolution <0.1 nT within\nits full-scale range of 15000\u201365000 nT. The ASM magnetometer is based on the\nElectron Spin Resonance (ESR) principle and makes use of the Zeeman effect which\nsplits the emission and absorption lines of atoms in an ambient magnetic field. The\npattern and amount of splitting is a signature of the magnetic field strength. The op-\ntically pumped helium magnetometer uses a High Frequency (HF) discharge within\na gas cell to excite 4He atoms from the ground state to the metastable state. This\nmetastable level is split by the Earth magnetic field into 3 Zeeman sublevels. The\nseparation of those sublevels is directly proportional to the ambient field strength\nand equals half the gyro frequency (eB/2m with m \u2013 electron mass).\n\n\n\nThe Swarm Magnetometry Package 149\n\nASM Specifications\n\nMass 3000 g\nPower consumption 5.3 W\nDimension Sensor Head 40 \u00d7 60mm\nDimension DPU 200 \u00d7 150 \u00d7 100mm\nData Rate 0.35 Mbyte/ day\nDynamic Range 15000 \u2013 65000 nT full scale\nAbsolute Accuracy <0.3 nT (2? )\nOmni-directional response < 0.1 nT angular dependence\n\n3.3 The Star Tracker (STR)\n\nThe STR provides the attitude of the VFM and both are co-mounted in a common\noptical bench. The ?ASC (Advanced Stellar Compass from DTU) star tracker is a\nwell proven instrument with an extensive space heritage. It features two fully cold/hot\nredundant DPU\u2019s. Full cross-strapping, each DPU can control one to four CHU\u2019s.\nMission specific baffles can be designed for optimum performance. It can provide 22\ntrue solutions per sec. The absolute accuracy is <1\u201d. The mass is < 1400g (3 \u00d7 CHU,\nBFL\u2019s & DPU). The power is < 5.7 W (3 \u00d7 CHU+DPU). It can support asteroid\nscience - Near Earth Object (NEO) detection and planets triangulation.\n\nFig. 4 The STR ?ASC for the Swarm mission. Central: redundant electronics box. Each side can\noperate up to four camera heads\n\n3.4 The Optical Becnch (OB)\n\nThe purpose of the Optical Bench is the transference of the attitude from the ex-\ntremely precise star trackers to the magnetometer field components. The OB ensures\na highly mechanical stable platform for the magnetometer and the star trackers.\n\n\n\n150 J.M.G. Merayo et al.\n\nA exhaustive thermo mechanical design and analysis is carried out to determine\nand minimize any thermal gradient that could cause a shift in the relative attitude\nbetween the two systems.\n\nThe STR are very magnetically clean, however the separation between the two\n(STR and VFM) is about 40 cm to reduce magnetic perturbation from the STR\u2019s.\nExploitation of symmetric system has been resulted in a cylindrical tube holding\nthe VFM sensor, minimizing transversal thermal gradients. Emphasis has been on\nthe matching of material parameter, use of iso-static support interfaces and detailed\nanalysis of loads.\n\nThe instruments are calibrated as stand alone and once integrated in the OB,\na inter-calibration and system verification is carried out in order to determine the\nrelative orientation between the VFM and STR and to verify that the stability is as\nrequired.\n\nFig. 5 The Optical Bench with three star tracker cameras (yellow, only two of them are shown)\nand the magnetometer sensor (green)\n\n4 Discussion\n\nThe \u00d8rsted, SAC-C and CHAMP satellites have had some overlaping during\n1999\u20132007, whereas MAGSAT has produced a reference measurement point at\n1980. These missions have produced a large amount of high quality magnetic field\ndata and therefore contributed enormously for the understanding of the Earth\u2019s mag-\nnetic field. This has yielded models that can represent the many field contributions\n(Earth\u2019s core, Earth\u2019s crust, large scale ionospheric and magnetospheric currents, in-\nteractions with the Sun, galaxy, ocean currents, tidal currents, earthquakes, etc . . .).\n\nIn some occasions there has been conjuctions of the orbits of these satellites\n(\u00d8rsted/CHAMP/SAC-C). However, the orbits are not optimized for certain field\nstructures analysis. In addition, the instrumentation and platform in these satellites\nare not uniform. The field measure in space is the result of many sources, which\ncan be spatial dependent but also time dependent. The volume out there in space is\nenormous, and therefore the space-time ambiguity can not be resolved with single\n\n\n\nThe Swarm Magnetometry Package 151\n\npoint measurements. Since it is not possible to have a fixed measuring point in\nspace, constellations have been devised in order to separate these sources in the\nmodels. Other constellations have been launched (Cluster, Stereo, Themis, . . .) for\nthe investigation of structures in specific regions of the Earth environment.\n\nThe rationale behind Swarm is that the signal extraction of space-temporal signa-\ntures can be optimized by designing the orbits of a constellation of three satellites.\nThis is of quite importance for further understanding the Earth and its evolution, and\ntherefore its history.\n\n5 Conclusion\n\nThe instruments planed for Swarm are the evolved counterparts of those flown on\n\u00d8rsted, with slightly better performance as well as mounted in a more mechani-\ncally stable optical bench. Therefore one could expect a factor of 5 better in overall\nperformance. The instruments are 10 times as stable and since there are three star\ncameras, a much better attitude can be determined in all directions.\n\nThe \u00d8rsted orbit was 600\u2013800 km whereas Swarm is planned for abot 350 km.\n\u00d8rsted is a low mass (60 kg) and gradient stabilized satellite, which need to be\nat high altitudes otherwise the air drag will unstabilize it and cause a fast orbital\ndecay. On the other Swarm has higher mass (?300kg), which allows it to fly in a\nmore aerodynamical regime, and at a lower orbits. In addition it also carries fuel\nand the altitude can be controlled as opposed to the case of \u00d8rsted. By using the\ncubic attenuation law (i.e. 850/350)3 ? 10), this could give up to a factor 10 on the\nmeasurement of the field. Therefore, in principle one of the Swarm satellites could\nprovide a precision up to 50 times better that \u00d8rsted.\n\nFinally, the instruments can be tested, calibrated and verified to probe the high\nperformance as stand alone. However, the VFM, which has to be calibrated with the\nASM, has to be related to a geographical coordinate system via the STR. Therefore,\none has to ensure that the measurement performance and thermal stability is not\ndegraded from the instrument level towards the satellite level. In addition, the long\nterm stability and timing between the three satellites has to also be ensured for the\nconstellation level.\n\nReferences\n\n1. E. Friis-Christensen, H.Lu?hr, and G.

The output of the study\nwill comprise a definition of a mission and required developments, along with esti-\nmated mission cost. In addition, and because the PROBA-3 mission has some capac-\nity for implementing an additional payload, the study will identify such a payload of\nopportunity along with its required development and cost which can take advantage\nof the PROBA-3 orbit and possibly its Formation Flying opportunities. The study\nis led by Astrium Satellites Ltd, with support from Astrium SAS, Astrium GmbH,\nENVEO, GMV and Verhaert Space.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe scope of work comprises identification, study and analysis of candidate EO\nmissions for implementation with small satellites of the PROBA-class flying ei-\nther in formation, constellation or as single spacecraft. Requirements are derived on\nFormation Flying techniques and technologies and on the PROBA-3 demonstration\nmission to serve EO mission requirements.\n\nT.

Sephton et al.\n\nA trade-off and selection process is followed by the outline of a reference can-\ndidate Formation Flying EO small mission. The estimation of the advantages of the\nimplementation of the EO missions in Formation Flying assuming the performance\ndemonstrated by PROBA-3 and the establishment of the approach to future utilization\nof the technology, tools and facilities developed for PROBA-3 is performed. The term\n\u201cSmall Mission\u201d here implies small satellite platforms of the micro- and mini-sat class\nof up to 150 kg total spacecraft mass (e.g. PROBA, DMC, Myriade, etc.). An EO guest\npayload for the PROBA-3 platform will also be identified and analysed.\n\n2 PROBA-3\n\nPROBA-3 (Project for On-Board Autonomy) is an ESA precursor technology\ndemonstration mission to prove techniques and technologies which will be required\nfor future operational Formation Flying missions in the fields of space science, Earth\nObservation and surveillance. PROBA-3 will comprise two spacecraft with a com-\nbined mass in the range 500\u2013600 kg. The spacecraft will combine standard platform\ntechnology with new technology for Formation Flying command, guidance, navi-\ngation and control (GNC), relative metrology sensors and thrusters. The PROBA-3\nprogramme will also drive the development of advanced engineering processes for\nthe specification, design and verification of Formation Flying systems. The opera-\ntional lifetime of the mission will be two years, with a VEGA launch expected in\nthe 2010\u20132011 timeframe.\n\nThe principal science payload carried on PROBA-3 will be ASPIICS (\u201cAsso-\nciation de Satellite Pour Imagerie et l\u2019Interferometrie de la Couronne Solaire\u201d),\nwhich is a very large, externally occulted, solar coronagraph. The Occulter space-\ncraft carries an occulting disk which is approximately 1.5 m in diameter. The Coro-\nnagraph spacecraft carries the coronagraph optical instrument. For ASPIICS, the\nCoronagraph spacecraft flies in formation with respect to the Occulter, at a nominal\nseparation of between 150 m and 250 m, maintaining the entrance pupil of the Coro-\nnagraph optics centred within the shadow formed by the occulting disk. In addition\nto ASPIICS, PROBA-3 will conduct demonstrations of other Formation Flying ma-\nnoeuvres which are relevant for both future science and Earth Observation missions.\n\nA fundamental system design aspect of PROBA-3 is the choice of the opera-\ntional orbit. A highly elliptical orbit (HEO) has been selected (see Fig. 1), with\nan orbital period of three days. The high apogee of approx. 160,000 km provides\na benign environment for precision science operations closely representative of the\nenvironment of future operational missions flying in Lagrange orbits, and the low\nperigee of (initially) 800 km provides an environment to demonstrate low Earth orbit\n(LEO) type Formation Flying which is of relevance for Earth Observation missions.\nThe orbit period being an odd integer multiple of 24 hours means that apogee and\nperigee always occur over roughly the same longitude on the Earth\u2019s surface. The\norbit inclination is 32 degrees, which is a good compromise between the VEGA\ninjection capability and visibility from the designated ground station at Redu in\nBelgium. The orbit is oriented with the apogee over the Northern hemisphere and\n\n\n\nEO Formation Flying Applications for Small Satellite Missions 155\n\nperigee mainly over Australasia. The perigee height will vary over the course of the\ntwo year mission due to lunar-solar perturbations of the orbit.\n\nNon-Keplerian Formation Flying for both ASPIICS and other science demonstra-\ntions takes place during the apogee pass where the gravity gradient is very small.\nThe perigee pass will be free-flying, with the natural evolution of the relative motion\nunder the local gravity gradient.\n\nIt is planned that PROBA-3 will carry a guest EO payload of opportunity for\nwhich a nominal 30 kg mass allocation is reserved, whilst on the Coronagraph\nspacecraft there will be at least 40 W of power available away from apogee when\nthe Coronagraph optics and the laser metrology systems are switched off.\n\nFig. 1 PROBA-3 operational orbit \u2013 Ground trace (LHS) and Timeline (RHS)\n\n3 Selection of EO Formation Flying Missions and Guest Payloads\nof Opportunity\n\nThree broad categories of EO missions have been identified, i.e. missions requiring\nco-ordinated Formation Flying, missions benefiting from Formation Flying (\u201cloose\u201d\nFormation Flying, including also the single spacecraft case), and missions not re-\nquiring Formation Flying. The different applications of Formation Flying consid-\nered include:\n\n\u2013 Synergy of observations by splitting the payload onto several satellites.\n\u2013 Coincident observations of nadir and limb looking sensors, e.g. AceCHEM.\n\u2013 Aperture synthesis techniques (radar or optical), e.g. SMOS.\n\u2013 Synthesis of gradiometer baselines, e.g. GRACE / GOCE follow-on.\n\u2013 Stereoscopic and bistatic observations, e.g. for generation of DEM\u2019s.\n\nHigher altitudes benefit from lower disturbance forces and hence accuracy of\nformation positional measurement and control, but may require larger instruments\nto achieve required resolution of the desired EO parameter.\n\n\n\n156 T. Sephton et al.\n\nA number of primary and secondary selection criteria have been used to down-\nselect from an initial list of about 40 candidates to about 12 candidates now being\nanalysed in more detail, particularly with respect to their Formation Flying char-\nacteristics, and accommodation on PROBA-3. A number of these candidates are\ndescribed by way of example below.\n\n3.1 EO Small Missions (with or without Formation Flying)\n\n3.1.1 L-Band SAR and Single-Pass Interferometry\n\nSingle-pass interferometry removes the problem of temporal de-correlation that is\nalways associated with interferometric image pairs acquired at different times, and\nas such is highly desirable. Simultaneous acquisition is achieved by implementation\nof a 2 (or more) satellite constellation in which the orbits of the component satellites\nare carefully controlled so that appropriate interferometric baselines can be estab-\nlished. This type of system is achievable with current technologies and is within the\nreach of small satellites. Only one of the spacecraft needs to carry a transmitter, and\nthe other spacecraft receivers only.\n\nFig. 2 L-Band SAR Single-pass interferometry concept\n\n3.1.2 AERL \u2013 Aerosol Land Mission\n\nImproved information on optical depth, type and size of aerosol is needed for cli-\nmate and environmental research and for air pollution monitoring. Aerosols have an\neffect on the radiation balance of the Earth-atmosphere system that is not yet well\nknown, and the possible contribution (cooling or warming) of aerosols to global\nwarming is still a matter of controversy. In addition to direct radiative effects in the\n\n\n\nEO Formation Flying Applications for Small Satellite Missions 157\n\nclear atmosphere, their role as condensation nuclei is important. Another issue of\nincreasing concern is adverse effects on human health of very fine particles (\u201cfine\ndust\u201d) that have only recently been recognized as a major menace in Europe, calling\nfor urgent actions to reduce the concentrations of these particles. The UN/EC Con-\nvention on Long-Range Trans-boundary Air Pollution requires not only monitoring\nof trace gases, but also of tropospheric aerosol.\n\nIn view of these needs, the Aerosol Land Mission (AERL) has been proposed\nby ENVEO as a complement to the existing lower resolution (several km) global\naerosol missions such as POLDER (on PARASOL). The AERL mission would en-\nable the study of aerosol distribution and properties at regional scales with high spa-\ntial detail, measuring directional reflectance, polarization and aerosol layer height\nnear-simultaneously. Spatial resolution of about 250 m is proposed, being more than\nan order of magnitude below the resolution of the global aerosol missions. This is of\nparticular relevance for understanding and quantifying the main aerosol sources and\ntypes, and is also supportive for developing measures to reduce the concentration of\nfine dust in populated areas.\n\nFor retrieval of aerosol properties over land, it is necessary to separate the at-\nmosphere signal from the surface signal of unknown or poorly known reflection\nproperties. For this purpose it is necessary to obtain multiple viewing angle mea-\nsurements of both intensity and polarizations.\n\nFor retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and type, the observations re-\nquired are:\n\n\u2013 Intensity of backscattered solar radiation in 9 bands within 350\u2013940 nm, spectral\nresolution ca. 15 nm. Spatial resolution about 250 m to map aerosol sources.\n\n\u2013 Polarized radiance in 3 bands.\n\u2013 All observations in 3 pointing directions: ?55?, 0?, 55; azimuth close to the prin-\n\ncipal plane (?? = 0?).\n\nFor information on aerosol layer height (ALH) and vertical aerosol distribution:\n\n\u2013 Intensity of backscattered solar radiation in about 4 channels of the Oxygen\nA-band (760 nm), ?? ?= 1 nm resolution. Spatial resolution about 500 m.\n\n\u2013 All observations in 2 pointing directions: 0?, 55. Azimuth as above.\n\nFor complementary information on atmospheric water vapour content:\n\n\u2013 Intensity of backscattered solar radiation about 6 channels in the H2O bands\n(876 nm, 940 nm), ?? ?= 1 nm resolution.\n\n\u2013 All observations in 2 pointing directions: 0?, 55. Azimuth as above.\n\nThis leads to the combination of multispectral imaging radiometers and narrow\nband imaging spectrometer shown in Fig. 3.\n\n\n\n158 T. Sephton et al.\n\nFig. 3 LHS: Observation geometry of the AERL mission (\u00d72 multispectral imaging radiometers\nwith 3 view angles, narrow band imaging spectrometer with 2 view angles). RHS: Temporal vari-\nability of aerosols observed at Lago di Garda, 10 June 2003\n\n3.1.3 Thermal Inertia mapping\n\nThermal inertia of bodies is a measure of their resistance to changing temperature\nunder a time varying energy flux, and therefore it is proportional to the time involved\nin absorbing and losing heat; it increases with an increase in material conductivity,\ncapacity and density.\n\nThermal inertia can be defined as the amplitude of the diurnal temperature curve\nas illustrated in Fig. 4, or the maximum minus minimum surface temperature, and\nso can be determined by observing a particular area at two different times. The tem-\nperature of a material with low thermal inertia changes significantly during the day,\nwhile the temperature of a material with high thermal inertia does not change as\nrapidly. Deriving and understanding the thermal inertia of the surface can help to\nrecognize small-scale features of that surface. In conjunction with other data such\nas water vapour content, thermal inertia can help to characterize surface materials\nand the geological processes responsible for forming these materials.\n\nFig. 4 Changes in radiant temperatures of 5 surface-cover types during a 24-hour thermal cycle [1]\n\n\n\nEO Formation Flying Applications for Small Satellite Missions 159\n\nAlthough a traditional approach in evaluating thermal inertia involves both day\nand night coverage (see Fig. 5), it is also possible to discriminate between surfaces\nwith different thermal inertia using the thermal portion of the electromagnetic spec-\ntrum with coverage around noon: this is when the thermal contrast between dry and\nwet areas reaches maximum.\n\nFig. 5 Day (LHS) and night (RHS) thermal IR observations of North-East USA using Heat Capac-\nity Mapping Radiometer data (ref. http://www.fas.org/)\n\nThermal inertia mapping requires a single broad bandwidth thermal channel (e.g.\n10.5\u201312.5 microns) plus a single broad bandwidth visible channel to give surface\nalbedo. Some atmospheric spectral bands are also useful (for water vapour, etc) to\nremove the atmospheric effects from the thermal signature.\n\nThis concept is being evaluated within the study using microbolometers to deter-\nmine its feasibility as a potential EO Small Mission.\n\n3.2 Payloads of Opportunity\n\n3.2.1 Lightning Imagery Experiment (LIM)\n\nThe objective of this mission concept is to validate the measurement principle and\nusefulness of lightning imagery from near geo-orbit position. The mission is pro-\nposed as precursor for a lightning imager on the Meteosat Third Generation (MTG)\nsatellite, and is intended to provide real-time capabilities in lightning detection and\nlocation in support to nowcasting and Very Short Range Forecasting of severe storm\nhazards and lightning strike warning. As lightning is strongly correlated with storm-\nrelated phenomena like precipitation, hail and gust, a further objective is to act as\nproxy for intensive convection related to ice flux, updraft strength and convective\nrainfall.\n\nThe frequency of lightning depends on the climate zone, the season and on\nregional characteristics like surface topology, ocean currents and wind direction.\n\n\n\n160 T. Sephton et al.\n\nBetween 4 and 30 million lightning events per day occur worldwide (equivalent to\n100 lightning events per second), about 10% of which strike the ground. Lightning\nis monitored by observing a neutral oxygen line in the near IR (e.g. at 777.4 nm).\n\nFig. 6 Global lightning frequency\n\nThe LIM concept is being considered in this study as a potential payload of op-\nportunity for PROBA-3, perhaps operated from apogee. The integral trapped proton\nspectrum caused by passage through the Van-Allen Belt is relatively high, and will\nrequire special protective measures for the detector. The lightning imager conceived\nfor MTG has a mass of 48 kg and input power of 57 W.\n\n3.2.2 PARIS Spaceborne Demonstrator\n\nThe concept of using signals of opportunity for sea surface altimetry is well doc-\numented. The importance of pursuing such an instrument as PARIS (Passive Re-\nflectometry and Interferometry System) is the ability it has of providing a wide\nswath compared with the traditional nadir-looking radar altimeter, with the purpose\nof providing important oceanographic data to supplement that data already being\nacquired. This is achieved by selecting beams across the flight direction to look\ndirectly at the reflection specular point for opportunity signals from GNSS (Global\nNavigation Satellite System) satellites such as GPS and in the future GALILEO.\n\nThe instrument is a bi-static radar where the source is the GNSS transmitted\nsignal, the target is the sea, land or ice surface, and the Receiver is mounted on\na satellite which is at low altitude. By measurement of the Direct paths and the\nReflected paths, the relative mesoscale altitudes can be deduced.\n\nWith a major interest in mesoscale ocean altimetry to identify ocean eddies and\nother important characteristics, the PARIS instrument is ideally suited as it can\nprovide a wide swath (typically 1200 km for 500 km orbit) in line with the flight\ndirection. It is important to note the flexibility of the GNSS-R approach, as with a\nrelatively simple instrument it is possible to obtain scatterometry type of data for\n\n\n\nEO Formation Flying Applications for Small Satellite Missions 161\n\nsea-state measurements and sea surface wind speeds. The PARIS instrument is the\nnext step with the measurement of mesoscale altimetry. The major difference in\napproaches is that the PARIS instrument requires a more sophisticated antenna and\nbeam-steering system in order to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio, as well as\nmultiple frequencies (L1, L2 and L5) which can be used to reduce the effects of\nionospheric errors and also to reduce/eliminate phase ambiguities.\n\nFigure 7 shows the system block diagram.

In addition, GPS receivers serve as instruments\nfor geodetic and atmospheric research on an ever growing number of science mis-\nsions. The paper provides an overview of existing GPS receivers for LEO satellites,\ncovering both fully space qualified as well as commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) sys-\ntems. The needs of pure navigation receivers and advanced science instruments are\nindependently discussed and directions for future systems are identified. Potential\nbenefits of the new Galileo constellation are addressed and recommendations for\nfuture receiver developments are given.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nMore than 30 years have past since the first spaceborne GPS receiver was flown\non-board the Landsat-4 satellite. Since then, GPS has become a well accepted tool\nfor spacecraft navigation and scientific investigations. With at least four GPS satel-\nlites in view, a spaceborne GPS receiver can provide instantaneous position and\nvelocity as well as timing information onboard a user spacecraft. This enables new\nand powerful applications and promises relevant cost savings in ground operations\nand space equipment.\n\nO.

Montenbruck et al.\n\nBesides the navigation oriented applications, GPS sensors are more and more\nemployed as science instruments for geodetic and atmospheric research. GPS track-\ning has enabled the generation of high-fidelity gravity field models and GPS radio\noccultation (RO) measurements support a global near-real-time monitoring of the\ntroposphere and ionosphere. Finally, new science opportunities emerge through the\nanalysis of ground reflected GPS signals.\n\nSo far, the distinction between the navigation and science applications is almost\nunambiguously reflected in the choice of single- versus dual-frequency receiver\ntechnology. The vast number of GPS receivers in orbit are designed to provide\nnavigation and timing information with an accuracy that is well compatible with\nthe GPS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and thus the use of single-frequency\ntechnology. Science applications, on the other hand, demand the availability of\ndual-frequency measurements to measure (or eliminate) ionospheric path delays\nand to enable purely carrier-phase based navigation. In fact, high precision navi-\ngation marks the boundary between both receiver classes and a growing tendency to\nsupport these needs may be recognized in the receiver market.\n\nFollowing a more detailed discussion of navigation and science applications, an\noverview of current single-and dual-frequency receiver technology is given in the\nsubsequent sections. Thereafter, future technology needs and trends are discussed,\ngiving proper attention to the upcoming Galileo system. In view of limited space, the\npresentation is confined to the use of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\nreceivers on LEO satellites. These constitute the majority of missions and offer the\nlargest market segment for spaceborne GNSS technology. Special applications, such\nas GEO and HEO missions are beyond the scope of this survey and left for future\nstudies.\n\n2 Spaceborne GNSS Applications\n\n2.1 Navigation and Timing\n\nWith at least four GPS satellites in view, a spaceborne GPS (SGPS) receiver can\nprovide instantaneous position and velocity as well as time information onboard\na user spacecraft. The four-dimensional nature of the GPS navigation information\ndistinguishes it from other spacecraft tracking systems. This enables new and pow-\nerful applications and promises relevant cost savings in ground operations and space\nequipment [1]. So far, the usefulness of GPS has already been demonstrated for\n\n? precise orbit determination [2],\n? onboard time synchronization and geocoding of payload information [3],\n? autonomous orbit control and maneuver planning [4],\n? spacecraft formation flying [5, 6], and\n? onboard attitude determination [7, 8],\n\nto mention just the most popular applications.\n\n\n\nGPS for Microsatellites \u2013 Status and Perspectives 167\n\nFollowing the deactivation of Selective Availability (S/A), representative accura-\ncies for GPS based real-time navigation of spacecraft in low Earth orbit (LEO) are\non the order of 10 m for kinematic single-frequency solutions. Associated timing\naccuracies for onboard clock synchronization are generally better than 1?s. Using\ndual frequency receivers and dynamical filtering the real-time navigation accuracy\ncan further be improved to 1 m and below. In post-processing, accuracies of down to\n5 cm have been achieved using dual-frequency GPS measurements in combination\nwith sophisticated reduced dynamic orbit determination algorithms [2]. For relative\nnavigation of two spacecraft based on carrier-phase differential GPS (CDGPS), ac-\ncuracies of down to 1 mm have been demonstrated in real-time hardware-in-the-loop\nsimulations [5] as well as offline analyses of actual flight data [6].\n\nAs illustrated by these examples, spaceborne GPS sensors offer remarkable po-\nsitioning accuracies, that are hardly achieved with alternative tracking devices at\ncompetitive cost. Unfortunately, the same does not apply for GPS-based attitude\ndetermination, which generally suffers from short baselines and signal reflections\nat the spacecraft structure. Even though various successful flight demonstrations\nhave been reported in the literature ([7, 8]), the achieved accuracies of 0.1?\u20131? are\neasily outperformed by other attitude sensors such as star cameras and optical gyros.\nAttitude capable GPS receivers have therefore gained little attention by spacecraft\ndesigners and have not reached a fully operational status.\n\n2.2 Radio Science\n\nBesides the navigation oriented applications, GPS sensors are more and more em-\nployed as science instruments for geodetic and atmospheric research [9]. This is\nnicely exemplified by the German CHAMP satellite, which carries a BlackJack\ndual-frequency GPS receiver. GPS measurements collected onboard this satellite\nhave enabled the independent generation of high-fidelity gravity field models that\nnotably outperformed the results derived from all previous space missions [10]. GPS\nradio occultation measurements, furthermore, enable a tomographic and low-latency\nmonitoring of the troposphere and ionosphere for weather forecasts and atmospheric\nstudies [11]. GPS instruments for occultation measurements are flown on the latest\ngeneration of European meteorological satellites (METOP, [12]) and a global con-\nstellation (COSMIC) of five satellites carrying GPS occultation receivers has been\nlaunched by the Taiwanese government in 2006.\n\nWhile the use of GPS measurements for gravimetry and atmospheric research is\nnow a well established technology, new science opportunities emerge through the\nanalysis of ground reflected GPS signals. The GPS constellation offers a particularly\nlarge number of \u201cnatural\u201d signal sources for bistatic altimetry and surface roughness\nor wind speed measurements. The feasibility of these techniques has been demon-\nstrated the onboard CHAMP satellite [13, 14] and with a dedicated GPS receiver\nonboard the UK satellite of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation [15] and a variety\nof future space experiments has already been proposed by the science community.\n\n\n\n168 O. Montenbruck et al.\n\n3 Receiver Survey\n\nA non-exhaustive list of present and planned GPS receivers for space applications\nis provided in Tables 1 and 2 for single- and dual-frequency receivers, respectively.\nCompared to terrestrial GPS receivers, the environmental robustness of space equip-\nment is a continued source of concern. Key issues to be considered in this con-\ntext include the resistance to thermal-vacuum conditions, vibration and shock loads\nas well as ionizing radiation and single event effects. Besides a cost driving test\nand qualification effort that is implied by applicable space engineering standards,\nsuitably qualified electronic components are often less powerful and require higher\nresources (mass, power) than state-of-the-art consumer electronics.\n\nThe small market segment and high specialization of SGPS receivers as well\nas the associated test and qualification effort inevitably results in high unit cost\nranging from roughly 100 k\u20ac to 1 M\u20ac. Various companies and research institutes\nhave therefore made efforts to come up with low cost solutions based on the use of\ncommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Following the early work of SSTL,\nminiature single-frequency GPS receivers based on COTS components are now\nconsidered for numerous micro-satellites projects. An advanced example of these\nis DLR\u2019s check-card sized Phoenix GPS receiver, which has been selected for the\nProba-2, Flying Laptop, TET, ARGO, and X-Sat missions. The receiver offers a\npower consumption of less than one Watt and can provide real-time and offline\nnavigation down to the 1 m level [16]. It will also provide high-accuracy relative\nnavigation for the first European formation flying mission, PRISMA.\n\nBased on promising experience with single-frequency receivers, DLR has\ntaken the initiative to investigate the use of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) dual-\nfrequency receivers for space applications and perform a basic qualification program\n\nTable 1 Single-frequency GPS receivers for space applications\n\nManufact.

As part of this effort, NovAtel\u2019s OEM4-G2L\nreceiver and Septentrio\u2019s PolaRx have been demonstrated to cope with the signal\ndynamics and the environmental conditions of a low Earth satellite [19, 22]. Ex-\ntended flight demonstrations of these receivers are planned for 2008\u20132009 onboard\nthe Canadian CASSIOPE mission and the German TET technology demonstration\nmicro-satellite.\n\n4 Technology Needs and Trends\n\nThe applications and available receiver equipment discussed in the previous sec-\ntions nicely demonstrate that GNSS is a mature and well accepted technology for\nspace missions. Despite these achievements, continued research and development\nare deemed necessary to properly respond to needs of future mission designers and\nscientists. Even though the evolution of the spaceborne receiver market is not ex-\npected to parallel the explosive evolution of the terrestrial GNSS market, a continued\ngrowth and technical evolution are likewise expected. Aside from an overall need\nfor cost-reduction, the four key challenges have to be met: miniaturization, increased\naccuracy and robustness, support of new signals, and advanced science applications.\nThese are addressed in more detail in the subsequent paragraphs.\n\n\n\n170 O. Montenbruck et al.\n\n4.1 Miniaturization\n\nShrinking space programs and the interest in faster mission implementations have\nraised the attractiveness of small and micro-satellites that can be implemented by\nindividual research institutes or Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs). These\nmissions are generally characterized by limited engineering (and financial) budgets\nand benefit most from a further reduction in the size, mass and power consumption\nof avionics equipment. As a guideline, power consumptions below 1 W appear de-\nsirable for onboard radio navigation receivers that are continuously operated. This\nrequirement can presently only be met by COTS-base receivers such as the SGR-05,\nPhoenix and CCA-370HJ [23] receivers. Further efforts will thus be required to\nachieve a similar performance with fully space hardened electronic components.\n\nAn extreme case of miniature satellites is represented by the CubeSat initiative,\nwhich has resulted in numerous student projects around the world. At a nominal\nsize of 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 cm3, and an average power budget of 1 W, the use of a GPS\nreceiver onboard such satellites becomes highly demanding. Modified Garmin and\nTrimble receivers as well as Phoenix receivers are considered in some upcoming\nCubeSat missions, but no successful flight demonstration has yet been reported.\nDespite serious technical concerns and risks, the operation of GPS receivers onboard\nCubeSat satellites would ultimately be of benefit for the space community. Even\nsparse position fixes could assist a proper orbit determination and prediction in the\nabsence of continuous and reliable NORAD tracking and thus facilitate a better\nmaintenance of space object catalogues.\n\n4.2 Accuracy and Robustness\n\nApplications such as remote sensing, altimetry, and SAR interferometry drive the\nneed for sub-decimeter orbit information that is traditionally served by dual-frequency\nGNSS receivers and ground-based precise orbit determination (POD) systems [2]. So\nfar, a 10 m level accuracy has well been accepted for onboard purposes, but a 1m or\nbetter position knowledge already becomes desirable for onboard geocoding of high\nresolution imagery and open-loop altimeter operation. For comparison, a 0.5 m accu-\nracy (3D rms) is presently achieved by the DORIS tracking system onboard Jason-1\nusing the DIODE real-time navigation function. In case of spaceborne GPS, iono-\nspheric errors can well be eliminated through the use of dual-frequency tracking or\nthe GRAPHIC combination of code and phase date in single-frequency receivers [16].\nThis leaves theGPSbroadcastephemeriserrorswitharepresentativeSignal-In-Space-\nError (SISRE) of 1\u20131.5 m as the limiting factor. Even though a 0.5 m real-time position\naccuracy is within reach of a GPS based navigation system, this performance has so\nfar only been validated in lab experiments and flight demonstrations are still pending.\nAs a major step forward, JPL and NASA have implemented a service for transmitting\nreal-time corrections to the GPS broadcast ephemerides via the TDRSS satellites. In\ncombinationwith theReal-TimeGIPSYnavigationsoftware, thesecorrections should\nenable decimeter position accuracies onboard a LEO satellite [25].\n\n\n\nGPS for Microsatellites \u2013 Status and Perspectives 171\n\nIn terms of robustness, the long cold-start time (typically 10\u201315 min) of many\nspaceborne GPS receivers represents a limiting factor. In particular, GPS receivers\npresently don\u2019t lend themselves as safe-mode sensors that can deliver immediate\nposition and/or attitude information after being switched on. GPS tracking is hardly\nfeasible today on heavily tumbling spacecraft. Among others, fast signal acquisition\ntechniques will be required to extend the application range of GPS receivers for\nthese purposes.\n\n4.3 New Signals\n\nThe prospect of new GPS signals (L2C, L5, L1C) and the build-up of the Galileo\nConstellation causes great attention by terrestrial and spaceborne GNSS users\nalike [26]. Key benefits include the larger number of satellites transmitting naviga-\ntion signals and the improved signal characteristics. The larger number of satellites\nimproves\n\n? the geometric dilution of precision,\n? the redundancy and data screening capabilities, and\n? the number of occultation and reflection events for scientific applications.\n\nThe new signals and navigations data in turn offer\n\n? direct (versus-semi-codeless) tracking of dual-frequency signals,\n? lower tracking noise and enhanced multipath suppression,\n? data & pilot codes and an moderate increase in total signal power,\n? tri-carrier ambiguity resolution,\n? more accurate broadcast ephemerides,\n? integrity information.\n\nIt remains to be seen, which of these advantages can ultimately be materialized\nin future space missions. The improved multipath reduction, for example, applies\nonly for reflecting objects more than several meters from the antenna and is thus\nprimarily of interest for GNSS navigation in the vicinity of the International Space\nStation (ISS). On the other hand, radio occultation measurements will clearly benefit\nfrom the unencrypted ranging codes that enable improved signal-to-noise ratios and\ndual-frequency tracking down to very low tangent point altitudes.\n\nMost other benefits come at a notable increase in hardware cost and complexity.\nCompatibility with the new signals and the increased number of visible satellites\nwill trigger the demand (even though not necessarily a serious need) for a 2\u20133 times\nincrease in the processing power of correlators and micro-processors. With a total\nof four frequency bands (L1, L2, E5, E6) and an \u201cinflationary\u201d number of different\nsignals, a variety of different receiver designs are possible. It remains to be seen, which\ntypes of spaceborne GNSS receivers will ultimately evolve and find a sufficiently\nlarge market. Likely candidates include an L1 single-frequency receiver as well as a\nL1+E5a dual-frequency receiver for tracking open service signals from up to 24 GPS\n\n\n\n172 O. Montenbruck et al.\n\nand Galileo satellites. For an intermediate transition time, the need to support L2\nsignals of the GPS constellation, might even result in tri-band receiver designs. Given\nthe mass and power budgets of current space-grade GPS receivers, major efforts will,\nhowever, be required to keep the resulting receivers within reasonable limits.\n\n4.4 Advanced Science Applications\n\nLEO satellite-based Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers for bistatic\naltimetry/reflectometry and radio occultation measurements are of great interest as\na possible component of future tsunami and Earth observation systems [27]. The\ngeneral idea is that densely spaced grids of sea surface heights with a few cen-\ntimeters precision could be established fairly rapidly using multi-frequency GNSS\nreceivers as add-on payload to independently planned Earth observation missions.\nThe required performance of such a space-based monitoring system requires highly\nadvanced GNSS receivers with improved algorithms and quasi real-time data pro-\ncessing capabilities to satisfy the needs of a future spacebased Tsunami Early Warn-\ning System. To support these activities, GFZ and DLR have recently launched a\nstudy for the development of a GNSS Occultation, Reflectometry and Scatterometry\nreceiver (GORS) in the frame of GITEWS project [28]. A close cooperation between\nresearch organization and industry is considered as a key factor for a successful\ndevelopment of a cost effective science instruments. In view of limited projects\nbudgets and the restricted technical capabilities of current space-grade receivers,\nthe development activity and initial flight demonstrations will be based on the mod-\nification of a COTS based dual-frequency GNSS.\n\n5 Summary\n\nThe status and prospects of GNSS receiver technology for space applications have\nbeen described. Miniaturization, increased performance and the support of new nav-\nigation signals have been identified as needs for future missions. GNSS reflectome-\ntry and scatterometry are considered as emerging scientific applications that deserve\nproper attention by receiver system designers.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

J\u00f8rgensen, John L. J\u00f8rgensen, and Troelz Denver\n\nAbstract Recent advances in autonomous attitude determination instrumentation\nenable even small satellites flying fully autonomous multi head star trackers provid-\ning full accurate and robust attitude information. Each sensor provides the full atti-\ntude information but for robustness and optimal usage of the available information,\ni.e. optimal accuracy, methods for merging such data should be investigated. The\nneed for and desirability of attitude merging depends on the mission objective and\navailable resources. To enable real-time attitude control and reduce requirements\non download budget, on-board merging of attitude data will often be advantageous.\nThis should be weighted against the need for post observation reconstruction of\nattitudes, especially needed when end products are sensitive to optimal attitude re-\nconstruction. Instrument integrated merging algorithms will reduce the complexity\nof on-board AOCS. Methods for attitude merging are many. Two examples of merg-\ning methods taking into consideration anisotropic noise distributions are presented\nand discussed.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nWith the advances in development of sensor technology and onboard computational\npower, autonomous multi sensor attitude instruments are becoming the preferred\nchoice even for small satellite missions. As an example, several small satellites (e.g.\nPROBA, SMART-1, PROBA-2, Flying Laptop and PRISMA) are now featuring\nautonomous multi-head star-trackers.\n\nP.S.

(eds.), Small Satellites for Earth Observation, 175\nC\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008\n\n\n\n176 P.S. J\u00f8rgensen et al.\n\nMerging the individual measurements from several attitude sensors on a space-\ncraft has classically been performed in the on-board AOCS and when higher attitude\nknowledge is required on ground. However, with the computational surplus of state\nof the art multi-head attitude sensors, it is now possible to perform the attitude merg-\ning in the attitude instrument itself, while still enabling further improvements by\npost-processing on the ground. Despite that the process appears simple, this task is\nnot trivial, since the relative orientation between attitude-sensors will often be non-\nconstant over time due to thermally induces deformations in the spacecraft structure.\nApplied methods will, for optimal performance, have to take this into account, and\nreliably report the estimation of such biases and their variability.\n\nThere are several advantages of merging multi sensor attitudes in the instrument\nitself. Primarily, it reduces the complexity of the on-board AOCS sensor fusion mod-\nule, which especially for small satellites can be desirable. Secondly, solutions incor-\nporating measurements from several sensors will be more robust towards dropout\nof individual sensors. This is of interest to any mission, but especially to missions\nwith relatively high agility requirements; e.g. in Earth imaging and formation flying\napplications. Also, combining the measurement data will improve the accuracy of\nthe solution output from the attitude instrument. In addition to the obvious\n\n?\n(n)-\n\nnoise reduction from two or more measurement of the same physical quantity,\nanisotropic accuracy distributions can be improved. E.g. for a star tracker, the ac-\ncuracy of the determination of the roll about the line-of-sight can be reduced by a\nfactor in the range of 5\u201310 (depending on sensor geometry) by combining solutions\nfrom two or more heads.\n\nThis paper presents the rationales for instrument-integrated merging of attitude\nsolutions and discusses the pitfalls of this strategy. Two methods for merging attitude\nsolutions are presented. These apply regardless of whether the merging takes place in\nthe instrument, in the AOCS on-ground. An example of attitude merging results is\npresented.\n\n2 Why Instrument Integrated On-the-Fly Attitude Merging?\n\nMerging of attitude sensor data can be performed on ground (post observation)\nor on-the-fly (real-time), either in the on board AOCS core or in the individual\nmulti-sensor instrument. A number of parameters should be taken into account when\nevaluating pros and cons for either approach.\n\nOn-the-fly attitude merging is characterized by real-time response enabling real-\ntime agile attitude control. This includes both improved accuracy from merging\ntwo or more says on the attitude and increased robustness from immunity towards\noutages of individual sensors (e.g. blindings). These characteristics will be crucial\nto the overall mission success when the quality of the mission primary observation,\nobtained by e.g. telescopes, antennas or gravitometer, will be negatively impacted\nby lack of high accuracy attitude knowledge and control.\n\nSecondary benefits include reduced downlink budget requirements and reduced\ncosts of ground support operations.\n\n\n\nOn-the-Fly Merging of Attitude Solutions 177\n\nTable 1 Characteristics to be considered when evaluating on-the-fly vs. post observation merging\nof attitude data\n\nCharacteristics On-the-fly merging Post observation, on\nInstrument merging AOSC merging ground merging\n\nResponse time Real-time Real-time Days to weeks\nReal time attitude\n\ncontrol\nYes Yes No\n\nRobustness High High Low\nAccuracy High High High\nFlexibility of merging\n\nmethod\nMedium Medium High\n\nAdditional relative\norientation model\nparameters available\n\nNone-Few Some Many\n\nAOCS load Low High Low\nBandwidth required Low Low High\nScience reconstruction\n\npossibilities\nLimited, requires\n\ndownload\nof all data\n\nLimited, requires\ndownload\nof all data\n\nHigh\n\nThe main advantage of performing attitude merging within the individual instru-\nment is the reduction of AOCS complexity and required AOCS processing capabil-\nity as well as performing the merging at a stage where intimate knowledge of noise\nspectrum and distribution is well established. This is to be weighted against the ben-\nefits of performing the merging process in the AOCS, namely: Increased availability\nof additional parameters characterizing the S/C state, e.g. structure temperatures;\nfull system level control over the merging process.\n\nPost observation merging is on the other hand characterized by high flexibility\nand use-specific optimization of the merging method applied. This includes detailed\nmodeling of internal S/C platform flexures. This is especially needed when very high\naccuracy attitude information over the full orbit (attitude and pose) and over many\norbits (seasons and time) is essential to the mission end product but the primary\nobservation is not impacted by less than optimal attitude control, e.g. geopotential\nmapping missions.\n\nDepending on the mission attitude knowledge requirements and on-board pro-\ncessing resources, either strategy may be selected, but for some missions it may be\nnecessary to have both the fast response of on-board merging and the possibility of\npost processing the full attitude information from all sensors. Table 1 summarizes\nthe main characteristics.\n\n3 Merging Methods\n\nMerging of attitude information can be performed in numerous ways depending of\nthe goal and available information. Here methods will be restricted to simultaneous\nmeasurements from two or more sensor heads providing the full attitude (all three\n\n\n\n178 P.S. J\u00f8rgensen et al.\n\ndegrees of freedom) in each measurement, as it is the case for multi head star\ntrackers.\n\nThe attitude measurement gives the orientation of the sensor with respect to a\nreference frame (typically the inertial J2000 frame) and can be parameterized as\ne.g. a set of Euler angles, a quaternion or a direction cosines matrix.\n\nTwo important features characterize the merging method:\n\n? Weighting. If weighting information in the form of noise estimates for the indi-\nvidual measurement is available this should be included in the merging. At least\nsensor specific information on anisotropic noise distribution should be used.\n\n? Relative orientation of sensors. Either assumed to be constant or varying. If the\nrelative orientation is assumed to be varying it may either be modeled against\nexternal information or simply filtered/traced.\n\nWhen performing attitude merging it is essential to include knowledge about the\nrelative sensor noise and the noise distribution properties. Relative sensor noise of\nnormally specified as part of the measurement data in the form of e.g. a residual.\nSensors will often have anisotropic noise distributions. For the star tracker example\nthe direction of the boresight axis is determined with an accuracy, which is a fac-\ntor 5\u201310 better than the accuracy of the rotation about the boresight axis. This is\nillustrated in Fig. 1.\n\nFig. 1 Example of\nanisotropic noise distribution\nfor a star tracker. Dotted lines\ngive the error ellipses for\neach of the three axis of the\nmeasurement frame. Since\nthe pointing error typically is\nthe same in all directions, the\nuncertainty of the pointing\nvector result in a small error\ncircle. Since the roll noise is\nhigher than the pointing\nnoise, the error at lateral\ndirections result in an error\nellipse\n\nWhen merging data with anisotropic noise distributions care must be taken to\navoid worsening the overall noise. An example of this is shown in Fig. 2.\n\nHowever including knowledge about the noise distribution can improve the accu-\nracy of the merged solution relative to the two individual solutions. This is illustrated\nin Fig. 3.\n\nFor most S/C platforms the relative orientation between sensors will vary over\ntime. This is a consequence of varying thermo-mechanical loads on the structure.\nOften a correlation with the orbit period is seen, an example of this is shown in\nFig. 4. The magnitude of these variations will depend on the platform design, but\n\n\n\nOn-the-Fly Merging of Attitude Solutions 179\n\nFig. 2 Example of attitude merging of two orthogonal star trackers with anisotropic noise distri-\nbution. Simple averaging of the two independent attitude solutions will lead to less than optimal\nattitude knowledge. E.g. if simple addition of vectors is used, the error ellipse is added to the small\nerror circle for two axes giving a new ellipse, and the two error ellipses will add to a large error\ncircle in the last axis\n\nFig. 3 Example of merging method where anisotropic noise distribution has been taken into\naccount\n\nFig. 4 Variation of relative orientation between two sensors over 6 consecutive orbits. The relative\norientation is represented by the Inter Boresight Angle (IBA). IBA is offset 0.01 deg pr. orbit for\nclarity\n\n\n\n180 P.S. J\u00f8rgensen et al.\n\nwill often be in the range of several tens of arc seconds for standard platform struc-\ntures. Very stable platforms can be achieved by careful design, i.e. the SWARM\noptical bench carrying vector magnetometer and star trackers aims at a sub-arc sec-\nond stability through the use of ultra low thermal expansion coefficient materials\ncombined with thermal stability control [1].\n\nStability of the S/C structure shall be taken into account both when designing the\nmission and when selecting the method for attitude merging.\n\nIn the following, two examples of attitude merging methods for star tracker mea-\nsurements are given.\n\n3.1 Merging of Two Boresight Directions\n\nA simple form of attitude merging of star tracker data is performed by merging the\ntwo line-of-sight directions into a single common reference frame [2]. This merging\nmethod utilizes the fact that for star trackers the boresight direction is more accu-\nrately determined than the rotation angle about this axis. The merging of the two\nboresight directions (?1 and ?2) is performed by constructing:\n\n?a = ?1 + ?2|?1 + ?2|\n?b = ?1 ? ?2|?1 ? ?2|\n?c = ?a \u00d7 ?b\n\nThis orthogonal triad constitutes the merged common frame specifying the at-\ntitude and will carry the full accuracy in all three axes. Assuming a rigid support\nstructure, the relative rotation (Ri?C ) from each of the sensor frames (i = 1, 2)\nto the common (C) frame may be calculated for each attitude update. In case of\ndropout of one of the sensors, the common frame is constructed by offsetting the\nvalid measurement with (Ri?C ). In case of a non-rigid support structure filtering or\nparameterized modeling of (Ri?C ) may be introduced.\n\nThis method does not support the introduction of variable weighting information\nbut fixed weights may be incorporated if relevant.\n\nResults obtained using this method is exemplified below. The example shows\nthe merging for two sensor heads placed on a common bracket structure having an\nangle of 40 deg between the two boresights. The measurements were carried out\non ground with two star trackers on a common mounting structure, operated at sea\nlevel, and thus show an elevated noise level relative to what is observed in space\ndue to the influence of the atmosphere. Note the much smaller scale of the graphs\nshowing the boresight direction (1st axis).\n\nIt is seen that the asymmetry in the noise distribution is significantly improved in\nthe merged data, while maintaining the good overall performance.\n\n\n\nOn-the-Fly Merging of Attitude Solutions 181\n\nFig. 5 Noise estimation in native star tracker frame for two sensor heads obtained from on ground\nmeasurements. The anisotropic noise distribution is clearly seen\n\n\n\n182 P.S. J\u00f8rgensen et al.\n\nFig. 6 Noise estimation for combined attitude solution obtained merging the two boresights. Please\nnote that the three axes are not the same as for the individual sensors\n\n3.2 Merging of the Full Attitude Information\n\nUsing the full attitude information from each sensor, any information on anisotropy\nin the measurement accuracy should be used in the merging process. A method\nachieving this is described in [3].\n\nIf the simultaneous attitudes measurements are represented by DC matrices\n(RRE F?i ) and the orientation of the common frame (C) with respect to each sensor\nframe is Ri?C is assumed fixed. The sensor specific noise distribution matrix ?i shall\nbe transformed to the common frame resulting in ?Ci .\n\n?C,i = (Ri?C ) ?i (Ri?C )T\n\nThe noise distribution in the common frame is then applied as weights for merg-\ning the individual attitudes in the common frame RRE F?C,i .\n\nRRE F?C,i = Ri?C RRE F,i\n\nAlso for this method the relative orientation between sensor and common frame\ncan be modeled or filtered depending on available information and application.\n\n\n\nOn-the-Fly Merging of Attitude Solutions 183\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nMerging of individual attitude solutions from multi sensor head attitude instruments\nis important for obtaining the optimal performance with respect to accuracy and\nrobustness. This merging can take place within the instrument, in on-board AOCS\nor on ground. Advantages and drawbacks of either approach have been discussed.\nOn-the-fly attitude merging is crucial to missions where the primary observation will\nbe influenced negatively by less than optimal attitude knowledge. Other missions\nmay do as fine with on-ground post processing. When selecting merging method it\nimportant to take into consideration weighting of the available attitude information,\nespecially in the case of anisotropic noise distributions shall be included. Also plat-\nform stability shall be given consideration and if needed modeling or filtering of the\nrelative attitude between sensors shall be included in the method.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

With this configuration, the management of magnetic torque is\nimportant for attitude control. This paper proposes practical MTQs drive algorithm\nto generate required magnetic torque, maintaining undesirable disturbance torque to\nbe low enough even in the neighborhood of singular points.

These proposed methods are\ndemonstrated with in-orbit data of the REIMEI microsatellite.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecently, small or micro satellites attract interest, as a way to access space fre-\nquently with practical cost. Also in the field of space science, several small/micro\nsatellites have achieved significant success. One typical example is the MOST satel-\nlite [1], and it indicates that the attitude control performance is important even for\nsmall/micro satellites. It should be also true for earth observation applications. Re-\naction wheel is the most commonly used actuators for usual attitude control system,\nhowever, reaction wheel is not suitable for some smaller spacecraft, from the view\n\nS.-I.

Magnetic torquer (MTQ) seems to be more practical\nsolution for micro satellites.\n\nINDEX (INnovative-technology Demonstration EXperiment) is a 70 kg scientific\nmicrosatellite for aurora observation (Fig. 1). On August 2005, it was successfully\nreleased into a nearly sun-synchronous polar orbit by Dnepr rocket, and then re-\nnamed as REIMEI. Restricted mass budget allows only one reaction wheel for this\nsatellite. Therefore, three magnetic torquers are the main actuators. Even with this\nconfiguration, the REIMEI satellite achieved attitude control capability with accu-\nracy of 0.05\u20130.1?. This paper describes two key technologies for such magnetic\nattitude control system (ACS). One of them is the algorithm to calculate magnetic\ndipole, to generate required torque avoiding singularity problems. The other is in-\norbit estimation of residual magnetic dipole.\n\n2 REIMEI and its ACS Overview\n\nThis section briefly introduces the REIMEI satellite and its attitude control system.\nIt will be helpful to understand following academic discussions.\n\nREIMEI is about 70 kg in weight, and 50 cm cube in stowed configuration. For\naurora observation, REIMEI payload consists of two main instruments:\n\n? Multi channel auroral camera (MAC), high time/spatial resolution auroral imager\nwith three CCD and interference filters.\n\n? Electron/ion energy spectral analyzer (E/ISA), to analyze energy spectra of elec-\ntrons and ions with a capability of high-time resolution.\n\nOne typical observation with these instruments is simultaneous observation of\nparticle and image. E/ISA analyzes the energy spectra at the spacecraft, and MAC\ncaptures auroral image at magnetic line foot point, where aurora is energized by\nthe particle E/ISA observed. Such observation requires spacecraft with three-axis\nstabilization and inertial pointing capability. The required accuracy of attitude de-\ntermination is less than 0.05?, and the precision of attitude control is less than 0.5?.\n\nOne strong constraint on the ACS design is limited mass budget of microsatellite.\nTwo or more wheels could not be accepted in this point. Therefore, REIMEI ACS\nconsists of three orthogonal magnetic torquers (MTQs) and one momentum wheel\n(MW) as actuators. MW provides agility around roll axis, and MTQs generate atti-\ntude control torque around yaw and pitch axis. In this point, magnetic torque plays\nan important role.\n\nFigure 1 shows the layout of spacecraft and its coordinate system. Momentum\nwheel axis is parallel to the z-body axis (roll axis), and provides gyroscopic rigidity.\nMAC and star tracker field-of-view are in +x and ?x direction, respectively. IRU\nconsists of three fiber optic gyros (FOGs), which are small COTS devices. REIMEI\nACS also consists of two sun sensors and one three-axis magnetometer (MAG).\nSpecifications of ACS sensors and actuators are listed in Table 1. Note that all com-\nputational tasks are executed on one integrated control unit (ICU) with SH-3 CPU.\n\n\n\nDesign and On-Orbit Evaluation of Magnetic Attitude Control System 187\n\nS\n-\nb\na\nn\nd\n \nA\nN\nT\n\nG\nP\nS\n-\nA\nN\nT\n\nS\n-\nb\na\nn\nd\n \nA\nN\nT\n\nS\np\ni\nn\n \nS\nu\nn\n \nS\ne\nn\ns\n,\n\n(\nS\nS\nA\nS\n)\n\nS\no\nl\na\nr\n \nR\ne\nf\nl\ne\nc\nt\no\nr\n\nF\nl\na\nn\ng\ne\n \nB\no\nl\nt\n\nS\nt\na\nr\n \nT\nr\na\nc\nk\ne\nr\n\n(\nS\nT\nT\n)\n\nT\ne\ns\nt\n \nS\no\nl\na\nr\n \nC\ne\nl\nl\n\nF\ni\nn\ne\n \nS\nu\nn\n \nS\ne\nn\ns\no\nr\n\n(\nN\nS\nA\nS\n)\n\nZ\n \n(\nR\no\nl\nl\n) X\n \n(\nY\na\nw\n)\n\nY\n \n(\nP\ni\nt\nc\nh\n)\n\nA\nu\nr\no\nr\na\n \nI\nm\na\ng\ne\nr\n\n(\nM\nA\nC\n)\n\nM\nT\nQ\n-\nY\n\nM\nT\nQ\n-\nZ\n\nA\nu\nr\no\nr\na\n \nI\nm\na\ng\ne\nr\n\n(\nM\nA\nC\n)\n\nS\n-\nb\na\nn\nd\n\nA\nN\nT\n-\nR\n\nS\n-\nb\na\nn\nd\n\nA\nN\nT\n-\nR\n\nC\nO\nP\n\nG\nP\nS\n-\nA\nN\nT\n\nZ\n \n(\nR\no\nl\nl\n)\n\nX\n \n(\nY\na\nw\n)\nY\n \n(\nP\ni\nt\nc\nh\n)\n\nF\nig\n\n.1\nT\n\nhe\nR\n\nE\nIM\n\nE\nI\n\nSp\nac\n\nec\nra\n\nft\nla\n\nyo\nut\n\nan\nd\n\nph\not\n\no\nin\n\nde\npl\n\noy\ned\n\nco\nnfi\n\ngu\nra\n\ntio\nn\n\n\n\n188 S.-I.

In the following section, algorithm of magnetic torque control\nis discussed.\n\n3 Magnetic Torque Control Low\n\n3.1 Formulation\n\nAttitude feedback controller requires certain amount of torque, which is a vector of\nthree components. One of three components can be managed by momentum wheel,\nand remaining two components should be generated with MTQs. The issue to solve\nis to find magnetic dipole M = [Mx , My, Mz]t which generates required torque on\ntwo axis, in geomagnetic field B= [Bx , By, Bz]t . If MW axis is parallel to z-body\naxis, required torque can be described as\n\nT? = [ T ?x T ?y\n]t\n\n. (1)\n\n\n\nDesign and On-Orbit Evaluation of Magnetic Attitude Control System 189\n\nSince M generates magnetic torque T = M \u00d7 B, equation of T? and M can be\ndescribed as\n\n[\nTx Ty\n\n]t = Bm2M, (2)\n\nwhere\n\nBm2 =\n[\n\n0 Bz ?By\n?Bz 0 Bx\n\n]\n. (3)\n\nUsually Bm2 is rank=2 matrix, therefore, magnetic dipole M for T\n? can be calculated\n\nwith pseudoinverse matrix,\n\nM = B#m2 T?, (4)\n\nwhere B#m2 is a pseudoinverse matrix of Bm2 . Note that eq. 2 is underdetermined\nsystem, with three equations for two variables. As commonly known, pseudoinverse\nmatrix finds out solution of minimum norm among all solutions. In other words,\neq. 4 finds out the most efficient M.\n\nHowever, problem of this calculation occurs when Bz = 0, since it is a singular\npoint of eq. 2. Mx and My have no contribution on magnetic torque, i.e., eq. 4 comes\nto be overdetermined, with two equations for one variables. Pseudoinverse matrix\nfor overdetermined system outputs error minimum solution, and in this case, results\nhuge magnetic dipole M. The MTQs are saturated with this solution and gener-\nate large disturbance torque on z-body axis. This disturbance magnetic torque can\nbe suppressed by momentum wheel torque, however, results large bias momentum\nfluctuation. Finally, it requires frequent unloading control and deteriorates attitude\ncontrol performance.\n\nTo improve this behavior, novel algorithm is proposed in this paper, which is\nbased on singularity robust inverse (SR-inverse) method. SR-inverse is proposed\nin the field of robotics [4], and also frequently used in CMG torque steering low.\nSR-inverse of Bm2 is\n\nB?m2 = Btm2\n(\nBm2 B\n\nt\nm2 + kI\n\n)?1\n, (5)\n\nwhere k is a parameter called scale factor. The solution of SR-inverse is determined\n\u201cby evaluating the exactness and the feasibility simultaneously\u201d [4], and k is a\nweighting factor to tune this balance. SR-inverse provides same M as pseudoinverse\nwhen k = 0.\n\nImportant design to use SR-inverse is the automatic adjustment law of scale fac-\ntor k. Generally speaking, k should have large value in the neighborhood of singular\npoints. This paper proposes k adjustment to maintain Tz within a limitation. The\ndifficulty of this adjustment exists in M saturation with MTQ capability, and in\nproposed algorithm, k is adjusted in step-by-step manner as follows.\n\n\n\n190 S.-I. Sakai et al.\n\n1. First, calculate Mz with SR-inverse,\n\nMz =\nBx T ?y ? By T ?x\nB2x + B2y + kz\n\n, (6)\n\nthen limit Mz with MTQ capability.\n2. Calculate Mx , My with SR-inverse and above Mz , as\n\nMx = ?\n(?T ?y + Bx Mz\n\n)\n, My = ?\n\n(\nT ?x + By Mz\n\n)\n, ? = Bz\n\nB2z + k\n, (7)\n\nthen limit Mx , My with MTQ capability.\n3. Calculate Tz which this M will generate,\n\nTz = By Mx ? Bx My, (8)\n\nthen adjust scale factor k with\n\nk j+1 =\n{\n\nk j + a?k j\n??Tzj\n\n?? ? Tz0\nb?k j\n\n??Tzj\n?? < Tz0\n\n?k = dkdT z\n(??Tzj\n\n?? ? Tz0\n)\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere a and b are the gain to tune the time response (a > 0, 0 < b < 1).\n\nIn eq. 6, kz is another scale factor to avoid singular point of B2x + B2y = 0. It is nec-\nessary since we apply SR-inverse with small modification such that\n\n??M2x + M2y\n?? is\n\nminimized instead of ?M?. Note that the computational complexity of this sequence\nis practical enough. Actually, it was implemented in REIMEI ACS.\n\nFigure 2 shows the simulation results of proposed method, comparing with pseu-\ndoinverse solution. Even in the neighborhood of singular points, Bz = 0, proposed\nmethod generates moderate magnetic dipole. Scale factor k is automatically adjusted\nto limit disturbance Tz , and Fig. 2 shows this effect clearly. Therefore, disturbance\nTz is much smaller than the pseudoinverse case.\n\n3.2 Time-Sharing Unloading Control\n\nAs discussed above, Bz = 0 is the singular point for control torque generation. In\ncontrast, larger Bx and By provides larger Tz . Since z-body axis is a bias momentum\naxis, period when Bz ? 0 is suitable for bias momentum unloading. Such time-\nsharing unloading control system was applied for REIMEI ACS.\n\n\n\nDesign and On-Orbit Evaluation of Magnetic Attitude Control System 191\n\n3.3 Feedback Controller Design\n\nFigure 3 shows the sensitivity function of the Euler angle feedback controller [6].\nSince design target is a bias momentum satellite, whose bias momentum axis is\nz-body axis, attitude around x? and y? body axis are controlled with torque of\ny? and x? body axis, respectively.\n\n(a)\nx 104\n\nTime [s]\n\n\u20134\n\u20132\n0\n2\n4\n\nB\nz\n[\nn\nT\n]\n\n(b)\n\nM\nx\n \n[\nA\nm\n2\n]\n\nM\ny\n \n[\nA\nm\n2\n]\n\nM\nZ\n \n[\nA\nm\n2\n]\n\nPseudo Inverse\nModified SR Inverse\n\nPseudo Inverse\n\nPseudo Inverse\n\nModified SR Inverse\n\nModified SR Inverse\n\n\u20138\n\u20136\n\u20134\n\u20132\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n(c)\n\n-1.5\n-1\n\n-0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5\n\n-1.5\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n1\n\n0\n\n1.5\n\nx 10-5\n\nx 10-5\n\nx 10-4\n\nx 10-11\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nT\nr\nq\nx\n \n[\nN\nm\n]\n\nT\nr\nq\ny\n \n[\nN\nm\n]\n\nT\nr\nq\nz\n \n[\nN\nm\n]\n\nPseudo Inverse\nModified SR Inverse\n\nModified SR Inverse\nPseudo Inverse\n\nReference\n\nReference\n\nLimited Value\n\nLimited Value\n\nModified SR Inverse Pseudo Inverse\n\n(d)\n\nS\nc\na\nl\ne\n \nF\na\nc\nt\no\nr\n \nk\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n1400120010008006004002000\n\nTime [s]\n\n1400120010008006004002000\n\nTime [s]\n1400120010008006004002000\n\nTime [s]\n1400120010008006004002000\n\nFig. 2 Magnetic torque generation in magnetic field B (a), Magnetic dipole M to generate required\nTx and Ty are calcurated with two methods (b), Since proposed method provides M with limitation\nof Tz < Tz01, disturbance torque Tz is much smaller than the pseudoinverse case (c), To limit the\nvalue of Tz , proposed method adjust the scale factor k dynamically (d)\n\n4 Residual Magnetic Moment Observer\n\nGenerally, dominant attitude disturbance source for LEO microsatellite is residual\nmagnetic dipole. Other disturbance sources, such as gravity gradient, solar radiation\npressure or air drag, have relatively small effect for small spacecraft.\n\nOne approach to suppress disturbance is to enhance the feedback controller. This\nis an orthodox way, however, it depends on several conditions such as sensor noise,\ncomputational performance or plant model accuracy. Another approach is feedfor-\nward cancellation of residual magnetic dipole. In this case, performance depends on\nthe accuracy of residual magnetic moment estimation. To estimate it with in-orbit\nattitude data, this paper proposes residual magnetic moment observer.\n\n\n\n192 S.-I.

First thing to do is to estimate disturbance torque Td with disturbance\nobserver (DOB) [7]. In Fig. 4, P(s) is a plant model for spacecraft with bias mo-\nmentum. Q(s) should be low pass filter, and its order must be equal or higher than\nthat of plant model. Input for DOB is s/c attitude y(t) and control torque u(t). Note\nthat u(t) can be calculated easily with MTQ output value and measured geomagnetic\nfield data, and MW torque value.\n\nThe other part of proposed observer is least square (LS) estimation of residual\nmagnetic dipole Mr, with observed disturbance torque T?d and measured geomag-\nnetic field B. Estimated value of Mr will be found, when LS method is applied for\nequation of\n\nT?d = Bm3Mr, (10)\n\nwhere\n\nBm3 =\n?\n\n?\n0 Bz ?By\n\n?Bz 0 Bx\nBy ?Bx 0\n\n?\n\n? . (11)\n\n\n\nDesign and On-Orbit Evaluation of Magnetic Attitude Control System 193\n\nExample of concrete implementation is described here for REIMEI case. The Q\nfilter of DOB is designed as Q(s) = 1/(? s + 1)3, where ? = 600 s. Since observed\nTd (t) has time delay of ? , therefore, geomagnetic field data is also filtered with Q(s)\nbefore LS estimation. With eq. 10, Mr is estimated based on T?d? s three components.\nHowever, it is also possible to estimate Mr with only [T?x , T?y], eq. 2 and eq. 3. With\nN sample data, the equation for LS method comes to be\n\n?\n\n????\n?\n\nT?dx1\nT?dy1\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\nT?dx N\nT?dyN\n\n?\n\n????\n?\n\n=\n\n?\n\n????\n?\n\n0 Bz1 ?By1\n?Bz1 0 Bx1\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n0 BzN ?ByN\n\n?BzN 0 Bx N\n\n?\n\n????\n?\n\nMr. (12)\n\nSince these matrices are usually huge, it is calculated as off-line calculation on\nground for REIMEI case. However, recursive LS method is also available for such\nestimation, and it will enable on-board real-time estimation.\n\n5 Evaluation of In-Orbit Performance\n\n5.1 Residual Magnetic Moment Estimation with In-Orbit Data\n\nProposed residual magnetic moment observer was applied for in-orbit attitude data\nas off-line calculation. Figure 5 shows the estimated disturbance torque, which is\nthe output of disturbance observer. This graph clearly shows that the period of dis-\nturbance torque is about half of orbital period. With these T?dx , T?dx and measured\ngeomagnetic field B, residual magnetic dipole Mr was estimated with least square\nmethod, resulted to be [?0.51, 0.042, 0.11] Am2. Torque values which is calculated\nwith B and this M?r are also plotted in Fig. 5 for comparison.\n\n5.2 Performance Enhancement with Observed Residual\nMagnetic Moment\n\nFinally, this estimated M?r was uploaded to spacecraft, and used as feedforward\nvalue, to cancel residual magnetic dipole. It means that this M?r is subtracted from\nM, which is the output of magnetic torque controller. Figure 6 shows the effect\nof this feedforward cancellation. This graph consists of four periods. In the first\nperiod, attitude is controlled with only feedback controller. In the second period,\nfeedforward cancellation was applied with 50% intensity. Then the intensity was\nincreased up to 75% of M?r, and at last, full amount of estimated value was applied.\nThese gradual steps clearly show the effect of Mr cancellation. It indicates the va-\nlidity of proposed Mr estimation method. Figure 7 shows the detailed response with\n\n\n\n194 S.-I.

It is revealed that with M?r feedforward\ncancellation, the pointing error decreased to 25\u201330%.\n\nSuch in-orbit Mr estimation is necessary even if it is measured on ground?\nWe suppose so. Just before the launch, Mr was measured in magnetic shielding\nchambers for REIMEI in the final flight configuration. Measurements were carried\nout for several situations, e.g., with stowed or deployed solar panel, power off or on\nwith batteries, etc. Then it was concluded that the residual magnetic moment of the\nREIMEI satellite is [?0.054, ?0.039, ?0.069] Am2. This measured value was also\napplied for feedforward cancellation, however, it did not improve the performance at\nall. It suggests that the residual magnetic moment was varied after the measurement,\nhowever, the reason is still a mystery.\n\n5.3 Statistics of In-Orbit Performance\n\nAt the end of this section, statistical evaluations are described. During July 2006,\nREIMEI carried out about 90 aurora imaging observations. Worst attitude feedback\nerror during each observation was evaluated for each case, then summarized in\nFig. 8. This histogram indicates that worst-of-worst feedback error is about 0.1?.\nAttitude determination error has been evaluated to be less than 0.05?. Pointing ac-\ncuracy is also confirmed with aurora imager, and this end-to-end absolute pointing\naccuracy was revealed to be 0.05\u20130.1?, typically. These evaluations clearly indicate\nthat the achieved performance meets the requirements, as shown in Table 2.\n\n\n\n196 S.-I.

Proposed methods are demonstrated with the REIMEI microsatellite,\nwhich was launched in 2005. One of our proposals is magnetic torque control law,\nfor a spacecraft with three MTQs and one MW. This method manages the mag-\nnetic torque, according to the torque value required by attitude controller. Algo-\nrithm based on SR-inverse matrix prevents undesirable disturbance torque in the\nneighborhood of singular points. Advantage of the proposed method is described\nwith simulations in comparison with usual pseudoinverse matrix. This algorithm\nwas actually applied in the REIMEI satellite, and contributes to achieve required\nACS performance.\n\nResidual magnetic moment observer is also proposed in this paper. This method\ncan estimate residual magnetic moment with in-orbit attitude and geomagnetic field\ndata. It is also applied for REIMEI satellite, and the estimated value was actually\napplied in the feedforward controller, to cancel disturbance torque by residual mag-\nnetic dipole. Compared to the performance without this feedforward, the attitude\ncontrol accuracy was significantly improved, such as 2\u20134 times better. In REIMEI\ncase, this estimation was carried out on ground as off-line calculation, however, on-\nline estimation will also practical with recursive least square method. Such real-time\n\n\n\nDesign and On-Orbit Evaluation of Magnetic Attitude Control System 197\n\nestimation will be valuable when residual magnetic moment varies dynamically, i.e.,\naffected by solar cell current.\n\nNote that the proposed residual magnetic moment observer should be also useful\nfor a small or micro satellite with pure magnetic attitude control system. Recently,\nnumbers of small/micro satellites are planed and launched. Magnetic based attitude\ncontrol system should be one attractive solution, with limited cost and mass budget\nof small/micro satellites. The problem is the limited direction of magnetic torque,\nwhich is always orthogonal to geomagnetic field. Several studies are carried out [3],\nhowever, the control bandwidth is theoretically limited. Dominant source of distur-\nbance torque for small/micro satellites is residual magnetic moments in many cases,\ntherefore, feedforward cancellation with proposed observer will enhance the attitude\ncontrol performance. The authors now estimate that pure magnetic attitude control\nwill achieve pointing accuracy of 1.0?, if proposed magnetic moment observer is\napplied.\n\nAcknowledgement This research was supported by all the members of INDEX/REIMEI team in\nISAS/JAXA, including many students from several universities.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

On the\nother hand, low cost Inertial Navigation System (INS) is suited for similar applica-\ntions. These systems are self-contained, non-interrupted and do not need external\nsignals. However, GPS errors result in constant drifts in position. These errors in\nposition grow with time, or are unlimited.\n\nThe INS and GPS systems have complementary characteristics, and hence, can\nbe selected for integrated navigation.\n\nTo determine the flight position, the INS system operates uninterrupted in an\nindependent mode. Whenever, the GPS system determines the position (usually at\nlower rate than the INS system), the INS system corrects the speed and position.\n\nThe commercial GPS systems can not produce the required altitude estimations\nindependently. Therefore, pressure sensor has been used to determine the errors in\nvertical channel. Kalman filter has been used to integrate all the measurements.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nWe have used off the shelf low cost sensors, and obtained the required integrity and\nreliability using an efficient algorithm. Integrity means these can judge the health of\ninput data.\n\nN.B.

Pouryaie\n\n2 INS & Magnetometers\n\nInertial navigation system is composed of three accelerometers & three gyros each\non its three measuring axes. Before mission INS needs initial alignment & calibra-\ntion to find out deterministic errors of sensors & initial attitude of vehicle. INS has\nalso some stochastic or random erros. Random errors of gyros can be compensated\nby making an AHRS. If vehicle is stationary (no thrust acceleration & centripetal\nacceleration) then by using the direction of local gravity vector measured by ac-\ncelerometer, INS can measure two angles roll & pitch. Gravitational acceleration is\nalways downwards & can be transformed in body frame (as sensed by accelerome-\nters) according to following relationship.\n\n?\n\n?\ngx\ngy\ngz\n\n?\n\n? =\n?\n\n?\n?g sin ?\n\ng cos ? sin ?\ng cos ? sin ?\n\n?\n\n? (1)\n\nwhere ? is the pitch angle & ? is the roll angle with these relations a rough estimate\nof roll & pitch can be made as under:\n\n? = tan?1\n(\n\nay\naz\n\n)\n\n? = sin?1\n(\n\nax\ng\n\n) (2)\n\nThe third angle or heading angle ? comes from magnetometer, with three mag-\nnetometers, we calculate magnetic field horizontal & vertical component in x & y\ndirection of inertial frame using frame transformation (body to inertial) as Mx , My\n& ultimately our heading angle is:\n\n? = ? tan?1\n(\n\nMy\nMx\n\n)\n(3)\n\nThe difference between geographic north & magnetic north is compensated each\ntime during navigation Gyros also give three angles, combining this information\nwith the above estimated angles we can estimate the day to day random biases\nof gyros, which can be compensated later during the mission. Random errors in\naccelerometers (which accumulate errors in position & velocity) are corrected using\nGPS data.\n\n3 GPS & Errors in GPS Data\n\nFour satellites are used to position the object on earth, three satellites determine the\nposition & fourth one is used to synchronize the clock of receiver with atomic clock\nof satellite. The GPS gives the position in geographic frame Latitude, Longitude,\n\n\n\nGPS and Low Cost Sensors in Navigation 201\n\nAltitude & velocities in North, East, down (local geographic) frame. Every satellite\nemits a signal which has following information:\n\nInformation about status of satellite, Data Acquisition, precision of satellite,\nionosphere delay, Ephemeris of satellite.\n\nThe precision of system depends upon six classes of errors:\nEphemeris data, Satellite clock, Ionosphere, Troposphere, Multipath\nReceiver. noise, software accuracy, and inter-channel biases\nGeometry of satellite with respect to user (Geometric Dilution of precision)\nError of Position = GDOP.UERE\nTable 1 Standard error model - L1 C/A (no SA), (One-sigma error, m)\n\nError source Bias Random Total DGPS\n\nEphemeris data 2.1 0.0 2.1 0.0\nSatellite clock 2.0 0.7 2.1 0.0\nIonosphere 4.0 0.5 4.0 0.4\nTroposphere 0.5 0.5 0.7 0.2\nMultipath 1.0 1.0 1.4 1.4\nReceiver measurement 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.5\n\nUser equivalent range\nError (UERE), rms 5.1 1.4 5.3 1.6\nFiltered UERE, rms 5.1 0.4 5.1 1.5\n\nVertical one-sigma errors \u2013 VDOP = 2.5 12.8 3.9\nHorizontal one-sigma errors \u2013 HDOP = 2.0 10.2 3.1\n\nTaking account of all these errors PPS service (with out selective availability)\ncontribute to following errors in position: 22 meter of incertitude in horizontal po-\nsition, 23 meter of incertitude in vertical position.\n\n4 Navigation Algorithm & Quaternion\n\nIn navigation different reference frames are used, for applications close to the sur-\nface of earth, earth centered inertial frame is used. The velocity of vehicle in inertial\nframe can be given as\n\n?i = ?e + ?ie \u00d7 r (4)\n\nDifferentiating above e?quation gives:\n\nai/ i = ae/ i????\nmeasured acceleration\n\n+ ?ie \u00d7 ?e? ?? ?\ncoriolis acceleration\n\n+ ?ie \u00d7 ?ie \u00d7 r? ?? ?\ncentripetal acceleration\n\n(5)\n\n?e = veloci ty of vehicle w.r.t earth frame\n?ie = rotation rate of earth w.r.t inertial frame\nr = position vector of vehicle\na = acceleration in respective frame\n\n\n\n202 N.B. Farahani, N. Pouryaie\n\nAs the accelerations are acquired in body frame, a transformation is required\nbetween body to inertial frame.

The attitude de-\ntermination algorithm which is based on a Kalman Filter and processes single dif-\nferences of the C/A-code and carrier phase measurements is shortly described. The\nalgorithm uses the LAMBDA-method to resolve the integer ambiguities of the dou-\nble differences of the carrier phase measurements. These resolved ambiguities are\nthen used to fix the single difference ambiguities in the filter. The results of ground\nbased tests and numerical simulations are introduced and the accuracy of the attitude\ndetermination algorithm is assessed.\n\n1 GENIUS Experiment on the Flying Laptop\n\nThe micro-satellite Flying Laptop is currently under development at the Institute of\nSpace Systems, Universita?t Stuttgart [1]. The satellite has a mass of about 100 kg,\nis three-axis stabilized and will be launched in a polar, sun-synchronous, low earth\norbit.\n\nGENIUS (Gps Enhanced Navigation Instrument for the Universita?t Stuttgart\nmicro-satellite) is an experiment for GPS based determination of the spacecraft\nattitude which is developed in cooperation with the German Space Operation Center\n\nA.

It also supplies the standard real-time position and velocity needed\nby the attitude control system for the nadir and target pointing mode. The GENIUS\nGPS system consists of three independent GPS receiver boards, each connected to\na separate antenna and low noise amplifier (LNA) as shown in Fig. 2. The GPS Box\nis connected to the on-board computer (OBC), the power control and distribution\nunit (PCDU) and the ultra stable oscillator (USO). The used Phoenix boards are\ncommercial 12-channel GPS L1 receivers with a DLR/GSOC developed firmware\nfor space and high dynamics applications [4]. Three GPS antennas are mounted on\nthe middle solar panel in an L-shaped arrangement, creating two baselines with a\nlength of 440 mm and 610 mm respectively (Fig. 1). The antennas are pointing in\nthe opposite direction of the payload cameras and therefore have optimum visibility\nof the GPS constellation during Earth observation. The three GPS receivers are inte-\ngrated in a single 100\u00d780\u00d767 mm box together with an interface board for RS-422\n\n\n\nGPS Based Attitude Determination for the Flying Laptop Satellite 213\n\nFig. 3 GPS Box hardware assembly (opened)\n\nconversion, the USO signal distributor and a latch-up protection for each receiver\n(Fig. 3). To achieve a high level of redundancy, each receiver can be switched on/off\nindependently varying the system input power from 0.9 W for 1 receiver to 2.6 W\nfor all 3 receivers according to measurements at the testing model. Among other\nhardware modifications to prepare the receiver boards for space usage, the oscilla-\ntors were removed to synchronize all receivers to the central 10 MHz USO. This\nexternal oven controlled crystal oscillator with a high accuracy of 10?13 over a\nperiod of 1000 s drives the clocks of the receivers and also eliminates variations\nbetween individual receiver clocks.\n\nGPS position and velocity are sent to the OBC every second, while the raw car-\nrier phase measurements are recorded every 10 s and will be dumped during ground\nstation contacts. With the algorithm described below, the satellites\u2019s attitude is cal-\nculated post facto and can be compared to the star tracker reference data for accuracy\nassessment.\n\n2 Attitude Determination Algorithm\n\nGPS attitude determination with carrier phase measurements is based on the prin-\ncipal of interferometry. Figure 4 depicts a carrier phase signal from a GPS satellite\narriving at two antennas separated by the distance b. The differential range from\nthe antennas to the GPS satellite consists of the fractional wavelength ?? which\ncan be measured by the receiver and the number N of complete cycles, which is\n\n\n\n214 A. Hauschild et al.\n\nunknown and therefore called integer ambiguity. If N is known, the angle ? between\nthe baseline and the line-of-sight vector to the GPS satellite can be determined via\n\ncos ? = ?? + N\nb\n\nHaving four or more measurements from different GPS satellites, the differential\nantenna vector (baseline) and the differential clock offset of the receivers can be\ndetermined [3]. Thus, GPS based attitude determination can be separated into two\ndifferent problems: First, the ambiguities of the carrier phase measurements must\nbe resolved prior to be able to use these measurements as precise range measure-\nments. Secondly, a filter algorithm must be implemented to improve the accuracy of\nthe attitude solution. In this section the filter algorithm shall be explained first and\nafterwards the ambiguity resolution procedure shall be introduced.\n\nFig. 4 Single baseline GPS\ninterferometry for attitude\ndetermination\n\nThe attitude determination algorithm used for GPS based attitude determination\nof the small-satellite Flying Laptop is based on a Kalman Filter. The filter state\nconsists of two baseline vectors, which are the relative position vectors between the\nGPS antennas. Since the GENIUS experiment employs three independent Phoenix\nGPS receivers, the differential receiver clock offset between two receivers involved\nin each baseline must be estimated. Finally the angular velocity vector of the satellite\nis estimated along with the ambiguities of the carrier phase measurements for each\nbaseline. The propagation of the relative antenna motion is based on a simple kine-\nmatic model, which assumes a rotation of the satellite body with a constant angular\nvelocity vector. The differential clock offset and the ambiguities are assumed to be\nconstant over time. Note that no differential equations must be solved in this case,\nsince the change in the baseline can be propagated using a simple rotation matrix\ncomputed from the angular velocity vector. Since this simplified system model is\nonly an approximation of the truth, process noise is included in the filter to avoid\na filter divergence due to unmodelled effects. In this case, variations of the satel-\nlite\u2019s angular velocity vector are compensated by angular accelerations, which are\nmodelled as Gaussian noise with zero mean. Variations in the differential receiver\nclock offset are modelled as a clock drift which consists of Gaussian noise with zero\n\n\n\nGPS Based Attitude Determination for the Flying Laptop Satellite 215\n\nmean. No process noise is added to the ambiguity estimates, since their values do\nnot change as long as the satellite is tracked continuously.\n\nThe filter processes inter-receiver single differences of the C/A-code and carrier\nphase measurements. The advantage of using differencial measurements is that errors\ncommon to both measurements cancel out. In this case the GPS satellites\u2019 clock off-\nset and all error which originate at the signal transmission path are eliminated. The\nremainingerrorsaredue to receivernoise,multiple signal receptionat theGPSantenna\nand antenna phase center variations. The angular velocity is not directly observable\nthrough the measurements and must therefore be estimated by the Kalman Filter.\n\nAs already mentioned previously, the ambiguities of the carrier phase measure-\nments must be resolved before these observables can be used for attitude determina-\ntion. There exists a great variety of ambiguity resolution methods in the literature.\nOne of the most powerful methods is the LAMBDA-method [5], which can re-\nsolve the integer ambiguities of carrier phase double differences based on a float\nestimate of these ambiguities and their corresponding covariance matrix. The at-\ntitude determination algorithm performs a check for unresolved ambiguities after\neach propagation step. If unresolved ambiguities exist, the estimates of the single\ndifferences from the filter state are transformed to double differences using a com-\nmon reference satellite. These float estimates of the double difference ambiguities\nare passed to the LAMBDA-method, which tries to resolve the integer values. If\nthe solution of the integer ambiguities passes a validation scheme, they are used to\nfix the single difference ambiguities in the filter state with a second measurement\nupdate. During this update, the integer double differences are used as \u201cpseudo\u201d-\nmeasurements of the single difference ambiguities. Since the double difference am-\nbiguities are known exactly from the LAMBDA-method, their standard deviation\nis set to zero during the measurement update. As a result, the entries in the filter\ncovariance matrix for the ambiguities are reduced to zero, which prevents the filter\nfrom updating the ambiguities during the following epochs. Thus the \u201cpseudo\u201d-\nmeasurement update allows to constrain the single difference ambiguities in the\nfilter efficiently.\n\nFinally, the attitude information must be computed from the baseline vectors.\nThe Kalman filter estimates the baseline vectors in the earth-fixed earth-centered\nframe. Additionally, the vector components of both baseline vectors in the satel-\nlite\u2019s body-fixed frame are known from pre-flight evaluations. The Triad-Method\nor the QUEST-Method are used to process the information to attitude coordinates\nparametrized as a rotation matrix or quaternions.\n\nFigure 5 depicts the complete attitude determination procedure. The algorithm\nstarts at each epoch with an editing of the available GPS satellites. At this point\nsatellites below a certain elevation threshold or below a minimum signal-to-noise\nratio are excluded. In the next two steps newly acquired and lost GPS satellites are\nincluded or excluded from the filter state. Then, a residual check of the carrier phase\nmeasurements is preformed for the satellite with already resolved ambiguities to\ndetect if the ambiguities of individual satellites have change by cycle slips. If the\nresidual check fails, the ambiguity of the affected satellite is resetted and marked\nas unresolved to ensure that the ambiguity resolution procedure is repeated for this\n\n\n\n216 A.

After the measurement update of the Kalman Filter, the ambiguity resolu-\ntion branch described previously is entered if necessary. Finally, after the baseline\nvectors are been transformed to attitude parameters, the state vector and the state\ncovariance matrix are propagated to the next epoch and the complete procedure is\niterated.\n\n3 Performance Evaluation\n\nThe verification and performance evaluation of the attitude determination algorithm\nhas been accomplished with test data, collected during a field experiment. For this\nexperiment, three GPS antennas have been mounted to an aluminum rack in a com-\nparable arrangement to the antenna system on the Flying Laptop satellite. The two\nbaseline vectors had a lengths of 0.4 m and 0.6 m. The aluminum rack has been\nplaced on a turntable in order to simulate the rotation of the satellite. The turntable\nallows a rotation of the antenna array around the vertical axis with a constant rate.\nThe antennas were connected to three Phoenix GPS receivers. The plots in Fig. 6\nshow the Euler angles yaw, pitch and roll over time for measurements taken over an\ninterval of one hour with a rotation rate of 1?/s. The angles describe the rotation of\nthe antenna array with respect to the local horizontal coordinate system. The upper\nplot for the yaw angle clearly shows the rotation rate of the platform. The plots\nfor the roll and pitch angle in the lower plot represent the tilt of the platform with\nrespect to the local horizon. Ideally, both angles should be zero at all times. Instead,\nboth pitch and roll angle show variations with a standard deviation of about 1?.\nThe maximum variations are in the order of 2?. The deviations of the roll and pitch\nangle are caused by errors in the horizontal components of the differential antenna\npositions. These positioning errors can be of different origin. The dominating error\nsource are multipath errors on the carrier phase measurements, which are caused by\nmultiple signal receptions at the antenna due to reflections of the electromagnetic\nwave at objects in the vicinity of the antenna array. During the field experiments,\nthe carrier phase multipath errors of low elevation satellites reached magnitudes of\nup to 2.5 cm [2], which corresponds to the observed deviations of the Euler angles.\nIn contrast to the measurement errors causes by the receiver noise, the assumption\nof a Gaussian distribution does not hold for multipath errors. Therefore these errors\nare more difficult to be filtered out using a Kalman Filter. Additionally, systematic\n\n\n\nGPS Based Attitude Determination for the Flying Laptop Satellite 217\n\nerrors like antenna phase center variations and mounting offsets introduce errors\nin the solution for the Euler angles. A rigor assessment of the magnitude of the\ndifferent error sources cannot be provided for the experiment, since no reference\nattitude from a more accurate sensor is available.\n\nIt can be stated from the results of the experiment that the algorithm provides\nreasonable results for the attitude solution. The noise on the measurements can be\nfiltered out effectively by the Kalman Filter, but systematic errors cause deviations\nof the attitude solution from the true solution. The single difference carrier phase\nambiguities for new satellites could be resolved within several seconds using the\nLAMBDA-method.\n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n?200\n?150\n?100\n?50\n\n0\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\n\nYaw Angle over Time\n\nTime [sec]\n\nE\nul\n\ner\n A\n\nng\nle\n\n [d\neg\n\n]\n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n\u20132\n\n?1.5\n?1\n\n?0.5\n0\n\n0.5\n1\n\n1.5\n2\n\nPitch and Roll Angle over Time\n\nTime [sec]\n\nE\nul\n\ner\n A\n\nng\nle\n\n [d\neg\n\n]\n\nYaw\n\nPitch\nRoll\n\nFig. 6 Yaw, pitch and roll angle with respect to the local coordinate frame for the dual baseline\nexperiment with a rotation rate of 1?/s\n\nIn order to prove that the algorithm can also handle the frequent changes of the\nGPS satellite constellation typical for space-borne applications, numerical simula-\ntions have been executed. During these simulations, the C/A-code and carrier-phase\nmeasurements of the GPS system on the Flying Laptop satellite have been created\nusing realistic attitude scenarios. In the first attitude scenario, the nadir-pointing-\nmode, the satellite orbits the earth with a constant angular velocity vector in nadir\norientation. In this attitude mode, the assumed system model for the Kalman Filter\ncomes close to the real world dynamics, thus the filter does not suffer performance\nproblems. The second attitude mode is the target pointing mode. During this mode,\nthe satellite is pointed to a target fixed on the earth\u2019s surface and thus continuously\ncontrolled by the attitude control system, which applies control torques to keep the\nsatellite aligned with the reference frame during its pass over the ground target. Due\nto the applied torques, the angular velocity vector of the satellite changes and the\nassumption made for the system model in the Kalman filter is no longer true.\n\n\n\n218 A. Hauschild et al.\n\nThe plots in Fig. 7 show the errors in the Euler angles between the reference atti-\ntude solution and the estimated attitude from the Kalman filter for the target pointing\nmode. For the upper plot in the figure a process noise of ??? = 0.5?/sec2 has been\nselected. It is obvious that the errors in the yaw, pitch and roll angles are close to\nzero over the complete simulation interval. For the middle plot the Kalman filter has\nbeen executed with the same settings as before, only the process noise of the system\nmodel has been reduced by one order of magnitude to ??? = 0.05?/sec2. In this plot,\nthe error for the pitch angle shows deviations of approximately 2? with respect to the\nnominal attitude. The yaw angle also shows deviations from the nominal attitude,\nwhich are much smaller and hardly recognizable in the plot. These deviations appear\nduring the transitions between nadir pointing and target pointing mode. Reducing\nthe process noise by another order of magnitude leads to the Euler angle errors as\nshown in the lower plot of Fig. 7. Obviously, the pitch error shows larger deviations\ncompared to the nominal attitude with a maximum error of 10? during the transitions\nbetween the two attitude modes. Additionally, the yaw and roll angle deviate from\nthe reference attitude in the same interval.\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800\n?5\n\n?2.5\n0\n\n2.5\n5\n\nEuler Angle Errors for Process Noise ? = 0.5 deg/sec2, 0.05 deg/sec2 and 0.005 deg/sec2\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800\n?5\n\n?2.5\n0\n\n2.5\n5\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800\n?10\n\n?5\n0\n5\n\n10\n\nTime [sec]\n\nE\nul\n\ner\n A\n\nng\nle\n\n [d\neg\n\n]\nE\n\nul\ner\n\n A\nng\n\nle\n [d\n\neg\n]\n\nE\nul\n\ner\n A\n\nng\nle\n\n [d\neg\n\n]\n\nYaw\nPitch\nRoll\n\nYaw\nPitch\nRoll\n\nYaw\nPitch\nRoll\n\nFig. 7 Euler Angle Errors for the target pointing mode from PEM simulations, the figure shows\nthe errors with different setting for the process noise ??? of 0.5?/s2, 0.05?/s2 and 0.005?/s2 (from\ntop to bottom)\n\nIt becomes obvious from the plot that choosing a comparably large amount of\nprocess noise avoids the deviation of the Euler angles from the true solution. This\nis a reasonable results, since the Kalman Filter assigns a higher weight to the mea-\nsurements than to the propagated system model during the state update. Decreasing\nthe process noise leads to deviations in the attitude solution since the filter relies\nmore and more on the (incorrectly) propagated system model, which does not take\nthe applied control torques into account. Thus parts of the information from the\n\n\n\nGPS Based Attitude Determination for the Flying Laptop Satellite 219\n\nmeasurements are ignored by the filter and the corrections applied to the baseline\nvectors and the angular velocity vector are too small. According to the previous dis-\ncussion the necessary process noise for a satisfying filter performance is determined\nby the target pointing mode, which is the worst case scenario for the filter. The\nstandard deviations of the Euler angles errors for the process noise of ??? = 0.5?/s2\nare ?? = 0.0445?, ?? = 0.1385? and ?? = 0.0972?. Thus an attitude determina-\ntion with approximately ? = 0.1? appears to be possible, which is one order of\nmagnitude smaller than the accuracy reached for the ground based experiments. It\nmust be noted though, that the numerical simulation does only contain the C/A-code\nand carrier phase measurement errors due to receiver noise. Multipath errors are\ndifficult to model and are thus not included in the simulation. Fortunately, signal\nreflections in space can only result from the satellite body itself. Since the three\nGPS antenna are mounted the panel with the solar generators, no objects which\ncould cause strong signal reflections are in the vicinity of the antennas. Though the\nmultipath errors had a comparably large impact on the filter performance during\nthe ground based experiment, their influence on the accuracy for the space-borne\nscenario can be expected to be much smaller.\n\n4 Summary, Conclusions and Future Work\n\nIn this paper the GPS based attitude determination system of university small satel-\nlite Flying Laptop has been introduced. An algorithm based on a Kalman Filter is\nused to process the measurement data and produce an offline attitude solution which\nwill be compared to the attitude information available from the satellite\u2019s star cam-\nera. The algorithm uses the LAMBDA-method to resolve the integer ambiguities\nof the double differences of the carrier phase measurements. These resolved double\ndifference ambiguities are then used to fix the single difference ambiguities in the\nfilter. Thus the algorithm provides a seamless transition from the ambiguity reso-\nlution to the attitude determination. The algorithm can be initialized without any a\npriori knowledge about the ambiguities or the initial attitude of the satellite. Ground\nbased tests and numerical simulation are used to validate the algorithm and assess\nits accuracy. It has been found that the attitude can be determined with a standard\ndeviation of about 1? for ground based tests under the influence of multipath and\nabout 0.1? for the space-borne application without multipath errors. The accuracy of\nthe algorithm in current form can be expected to be between 0.1? and 1? depending\non the magnitude of the systematic measurement errors in space.\n\nDuring target pointing mode, the changes in the angular velocity vector lead to\na divergence between the dynamics of the real system and the modelled system in\nthe Kalman filter. Though large deviations in the attitude solution can be avoided by\nincreasing the process noise, the suppression of measurement noise is less effective\nin this case. To overcome this drawback, a more sophisticated system model must\nbe used for the Kalman Filter which reflects the real system more closely. Addi-\ntionally, measurements from a rate gyro system can be used in addition to the GPS\nmeasurements\n\n\n\n220 A. Hauschild et al.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Kwon\n\nAbstract Electromagnetic Formation Flight (EMFF) is a proposed method of\nactuating multiple spacecraft in relative degrees of freedom using electromagnetic\nforces and reaction wheels. The electromagnetic dipole is created by running current\nthrough high temperature superconducting wire. One of the challenges of EMFF is\nmaintaining the cold temperatures necessary for superconducting. The current ther-\nmal design uses cryogenic coolers and multilayer insulation. This paper investigates\nmodels of the thermal design developed in Matlab and Sinda. The temperature dis-\ntribution is simulated first using a simplistic 1-D model and then a 3-D model for the\ncoil. The discrete solution procedure involves differencing Laplace\u2019s equations and\nincludes the effects of a material with anisotropic thermal conductivity and multiple\nlayers of insulating material. These results are then compared to experimental data,\nwhich are conducted using a copper test article in a vacuum chamber. Work done\non the Matlab model to match the experimental environment includes modeling the\nfree-molecular flow and accounting for the variation of parameters as a function\nof temperature. The Matlab model, Sinda and experimental results correlate well\nensuring that the EMFF thermal design will operate successful on a satellite.\n\n1 Motivation\n\nAn increasing number of missions are using multiple spacecraft flying in close prox-\nimity to replace traditional large monolithic space systems. Formation flying space\ninterferometers are an example of this application. A method of providing actuation\nfor these formation flight satellites is the use of electromagnetic forces and reac-\ntions wheels. This method has several advantages over traditional propellant-based\nthrusters such as the replacement of consumables to extend mission lifetime, elim-\nination of impinging thruster plumes, and the enabling of high ?V formation flight\n\nD.W.

A large steerable electromagnetic (EM) dipole can be created by running\ncurrent through three orthogonal coils made of high temperature superconducting\n(HTS) wire. The EM dipole creates coupled forces and torques on nearby satellites\nwith electromagnetic formation flight coils. Using a reaction wheel, one can de-couple\nthe forces and torques to provide all the necessary actuation in relative degrees of\nfreedom for a formation flight array [2]. Figure 1 shows a conceptual drawing of a\nsmall EMFF satellite which could be used for Earth observation missions.\n\nFig. 1 Conceptual drawing of\na small EMFF satellite\n\nThe HTS wire is an enabling technology for EMFF because it allows the cre-\nation of a large dipole field. One of the challenges of using HTS is maintaining\nthe temperature necessary for operation. The entire length of the superconducting\nwire must be maintained below a critical temperature in order for it to operate\nat superconducting levels. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) wire from American\nSuperconductor used by the EMFF testbed has a critical temperature, Tc, of 110 K.\nFor EMFF satellites in the proximity of Earth, LEO or GEO, heat from the sun and\nEarth need to be rejected in order to maintain temperatures below Tc. This can be\naccomplished using cryocoolers and various types of insulation such as Multilayer\nInsulation (MLI). One characteristic of the HTS wire is that at colder temperatures\nmore current can be driven through the wires creating a larger dipole field and thus\nimproving the performance of EMFF. However, this benefit comes at the expense\nof additional power and mass required by the thermal system. The unique problem\ninvestigated in this research is the topic of cooling large space structures.\n\nThe coil thermal system design is critical for the operation of EMFF in space.\nOn the MIT-Space Systems Lab EMFF testbed, the coils are immersed in a bath of\nliquid nitrogen to maintain a continuous temperature of 77 K [3]. The use of liquid\nnitrogen on the testbed does not migrate into a flight design because the liquid nitro-\ngen is a consumable. Since one of the benefits of EMFF is to replace consumables\nthe design of the thermal system must be self-sufficient. The first task to accomplish\nthe objective is to model the thermal performance of the design in simulation using\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic Formation Flight System Design 223\n\nMatlab. Operation of the design or a scaled model in a vacuum chamber, which\nsimulates the space environment, is then used to validate the Matlab models. Once\nthe cooling methods, heat distribution, and heat rejection methods are modeled and\nexperimentally verified, the thermal design can be migrated to a flight version with\nhigh confidence.\n\n2 Design Overview\n\nThe design of the coil thermal system is shown in Fig. 2 for a single coil. The HTS\nwire stack is wrapped around a thermally conductive jacket, which provides struc-\nture for the wire stack and electrical isolation. Around this is MLI, which provides\ngood insulation from the outside environment reducing the heat load into the coil.\nThe thermally conductive jacket also functions to provide a uniform temperature\ndistribution circumferentially around the coil, to serve as an attachment point for\ncooling, and as structure for the coil system and spacecraft. Heat is extracted from\nthe coil by a cryocooler.\n\nFig. 2 Design of an EMFF coil thermal system\n\nSystem trades have been performed to analyze the cost benefits of operating more\nthan one cryocooler. These analyses assumed steady state bulk heat flow with a uni-\nform temperature and heat flux distribution. It was determined that using multiple\ncryocoolers operating at different temperatures results in a minimum total power\nconsumption point. This is because a cryocooler requires less power when operating\nat warmer temperatures, given a constant thermal load. Also, given a constant cold\ntip temperature, a cryocooler requires less power at lower thermal loads. By imple-\nmenting one cryocooler on the outside of the insulation system, where the thermal\nload is high, but at a warmer temperature, and implementing one cryocooler right at\nthe coil working at a low temperature and low thermal load, an optimum operating\npower can be achieved. Here a system of two cryocoolers was analyzed. Figure 3\n\n\n\n224 D.W. Kwon\n\nshows that when the outer cryocooler is operating at 78 Watts and extracting 21\nthermal watts, the optimum total cryocooler power is approximately 200 Watts. This\nis for a large EMFF system with a one meter radius coil using a single vacuum gap\nfor insulation. The thermal environment analyzed the worst case heating from the\nsun for a single coil in steady-state. Given a smaller sized coil using the insulation\nsystem in Fig. 2, the heat extraction required by the cryocooler(s) is significantly\nreduced and the power needed could be lower than 50 Watts.\n\nThe current plan of approach is to utilize three types of models to reach confidence\non developing a flight-like thermal system. The nature of these models is analytic,\ndiscrete, and analog or experimental and is summarized in Table 1. For experimental\nvalidation it is sufficient to analyze a single HTS coil. The coil shown in Fig. 2 will\nbe enclosed in a vacuum chamber with cooling provided by liquid nitrogen since\na liquid nitrogen feedthrough is simpler and more cost effective than a cryocooler.\nUniform heating due to radiation from the wall provides the heating environment for\nthe coil. The coil is in contact with a thermal conductor and wrapped in MLI. The\ncurrent model uses a copper tube as the thermally conductive jacket. A more complex\ndesign can be analyzed once this simpler system is modeled in simulation and its\nperformance, i.e. the time-vary temperature distribution, is verified experimentally.\nThe models described in the following section details the chamber model.\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nOuter Cryocooler Power (Watts) \n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40\n\nOuter Cryocooler Power (Watts) \n\nT\not\n\nal\n P\n\now\ner\n\n (\nW\n\n)\n\n150\n\n100\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nFig. 3 Total power requirements using two cryocoolers\n\nTable 1 Plan for current approach\n\nAnalytic Discrete Analog\n\nPurpose Mathematical model of\ntemperature\ndistribution based on\nfirst principles\n\nFinite difference model\nsimulates temperature\ndistribution\n\nExperimental verification\nof analytic and discrete\nmodels\n\nBenefits High fidelity and strong\nunderstanding\n\nAbility to add\nnon-uniform\nparameters and well\nused codes\n\nFinal verification of\nmodel, increases TRL\nof EMFF\n\nLimitations Nonlinear Radiation term\nmakes solution\ncomplex\n\nLarge models are\ncomputationally\nexpensive\n\nImplementing model &\nenvironment accurately\nis challenging\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic Formation Flight System Design 225\n\n2.1 Analytic Model\n\nA 3-D analytic model in cylindrical coordinates (r , ? , z) has been developed for\nthe temperature distribution for the coil system shown in Fig. 2. Both the thermally\nconductive jacket and the MLI are modeled forming a two-layer model for a coil\nwith length, l. The function for the temperature distribution has the following form\nconsisting for Bessel functions (In , Kn) and sinusoids:\n\nT (r, ?, z) =\n??\n\nm=1\n\n??\n\nn=1\n\n(\nAmn In\n\n(\nm?\n\nl r\n) + Bmn Kn\n\n(\nm?\n\nl r\n))\n\ncos n? cos( m?l z)\n\n+\n??\n\nm=1\n\n(\nCm In\n\n(\nm?\n\nl r\n) + Dm Kn\n\n(\nm?\n\nl r\n))\n\ncos( m?l z)\n\n+\n??\n\nn=1\n\n(\nEnrn + Fnr?n\n\n)\ncos n? + G log r + H\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the constants (A through H ) are solved for by applying orthogonality and\nthe boundary conditions. The boundary condition given at the outer MLI layer is\na linearized form of the radiation from the chamber wall and from the coil itself\nradiating outwards. At the inner copper layer, the cryocooler was modeled to extract\nheat from a small segment of the coil. The analytic model determined that MLI is\na promising insulation material. It also showed that a simple conductor may not be\nsufficient as the thermal jacket around the HTS, because it exhibits a large temper-\nature spread away from the cryocooler. Placing multiple cryocoolers along the coil\nis a possible solution, but comes with mass and power penalties. The limitations of\nthe analytic model were that it contained a linearized radiation approximation and\ndid not model the anisotropic properties of the MLI. For these properties, the finite\ndifference model was used.\n\n2.2 Finite Difference Model (FDM)\n\nThe discrete model of the thermal system finite differences the coil in three di-\nmensions. A time-varying implicit model has been constructed for the thermally\nconductive jacket. This is an improvement over the analytic model, which was a\nsteady-state model. This time-varying FDM can be used to examine the transient\ncooling response of the coil. The anisotropic property of the MLI has also been\nmodeled. There is a thermal conductivity perpendicular to the radiation shields, Kr ,\nwhich acts through the MLI layers, and a thermal conductivity parallel to the radi-\nation shields, K? , acting along a MLI layer. The heat diffusion equation is used as\na starting point and is finite differenced so that the temperature at each node can be\nsolved by Gaussian Elimination.\n\nFigure 4 illustrates the general procedure used by the FDM for a one dimensional\nmodel. The FDM can use either a fixed temperature boundary condition or flux\nboundary condition at the cold point where the cryocooler is located. A control\n\n\n\n226 D.W.

Similar to the analytic model the FDM consists of\nthe inner copper jacket layer and the outer MLI layer, which is the EMFF thermal\ndesign from Fig. 2. The outer boundary accounts for the radiation from the chamber\nwalls (or deep space) and from the coil body, which is a function of temperature\nto the fourth power. The volumetric heat input into each node for a simplified 1-D\nmodel is expressed by:\n\nq? =\n\n?\n???\n\n???\n\nqcryo\nVolume Element\n\n, x = 0\n\n?t ?\n[\nT 4w?(T ni )\n\n4\n]\n\nAc\n\nVolume Element , x > 0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere qcryo is the heat extracted by the cryocooler (or liquid nitrogen) located at\nthe origin, and T ni is the temperature of the coil at a location i at time n. The ef-\nfective emissivity, ?t , accounts for the emissivity of both the chamber walls and the\ntest article and their view factor. In addition, the model captures the effect of free-\nmolecular flow in the chamber and also the variation of thermal diffusivity, ?\n\n(\nT ni\n\n)\n,\n\nas a function of temperature. The heat flux into the coil due to free-molecular flow\nis given by:\n\nq\n[\nw\n/\nm2\n\n] = FaGp (T2 ? T1) = hef f (TCU ? Tw) (3)\nwhere the effective convection coefficient, hef f , is largely a function of p, the system\npressure. It was found that the free-molecular flow is a very low order effect on the\nsystem.\n\nFor comparison with the Matlab models, a simple 1-D model of the copper tube\nconsisting of 19 nodes was constructed in a commercially available thermal code\ncalledSinda.TheSindamodel represented theexperimental setupused in thechamber.\n\n2.3 Experimental Model\n\nA toroidal vacuum chamber was designed and built by MIT and Payload Systems\nInc. as a testing facility for the thermal design and is shown in Fig. 5. The chamber,\nconstructed out of COTS Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) tubes, has a major radius of\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic Formation Flight System Design 227\n\n1 m, minor radius of 12.5 cm, and holds a high vacuum (10?5 Torr). Currently a\ncopper tube is used as the test article to represent the thermally conductive jacket. A\nliquid nitrogen feedthrough enters the chamber and wraps around the copper article\nso that conduction with the liquid nitrogen tubing provides cooling for the entire\narticle and acts as the cryocooler. Three plastic spacers support the copper tube. Ten\nthermocouples are inside the chamber via two instrumentation feedthroughs. It has\nbeen shown that the experiment is repeatable. A single tank of liquid nitrogen allows\nfor approximately 3 hours of cooling time. The transient cooling data of the copper\ntube was used for comparison with the simulation models.\n\nThermocouple\nfeedthrough \n\nCopper Test Article\n\nLiquid Nitrogen\ncooling loops\n\nFig. 5 Experimental vacuum chamber (opened) for EMFF thermal system\n\n2.4 Model Comparison\n\nSimulation models that were created include a 1-D FDM, 3-D FDM, and Sinda\nmodel. It has been shown in Fig. 6a that all three of these models match each other\nfor a one meter coil (modeled as the copper test article) in the experimental vacuum\nchamber. The boundary condition used at the cryogenic cold finger was a fixed\ntemperature of 100 K. The temperature increases as distance along the coil circum-\nferentially (z-direction) increases and the maximum temperature is located opposite\nthe coil, as expected.\n\nTo match the experimental model, the 3-D FDM was expanded to use the ex-\nperimental data for the wall temperature and cold point temperature at the liquid\nnitrogen feedthrough. Overall, the experimental data had a faster transient cooling\nrate than predicted by models, however the FDM matched the experimental data\nto within 10 K at the end of the data run (approximately 3 hours), which is shown\nin Fig. 6b. The figure shows the temperature along the coil according to the model\n(solid line) and at nine thermocouple locations. Discrepancies between the model\n\n\n\n228 D.W.

Also heat introduction from the spacers holding up the\ntest article and through the thermocouple wires are not incorporated in the model.\nWhile the maximum temperature of the design with just the thermally conductive\njacket is higher than Tc, the Matlab models can now be run with the MLI incor-\nporated in the design. Current results indicate that even with MLI the maximum\ntemperature is greater than Tc. In order to obtain a more uniform temperature distri-\nbution around the coil, a heat pipe operating at cryogenic temperatures can be used.\nThe heat pipe acts as the thermal conductive jacket and the HTS wire stack is located\ninside the pipe in the vapor space. Preliminary design of the heat pipe using multiple\nscreen mesh layers as the wicking structure and using nitrogen as the working gas\nallows for a heat pipe with sufficient power capacity, in the tens of Watts, to cool the\nentire coil. Implementation of the cryogenic heat pipe is currently underway.\n\n3 Conclusions\n\nElectromagnetic formation flight is a unique and promising method of actuation for\nformation flight systems. The thermal system is a critical aspect of the design for\nan EMFF system since constant low temperature control of the superconducting\ncoils is required despite a large variation of heating environments possible in low\nEarth orbit. The current thermal system design consisting of multilayer insulation\nand a thermally conductive jacket to maintain uniform temperatures around the coil\nhas been modeled analytically and using finite difference models. These models\ncorrelate well in an experimental chamber set up for testing the thermal design.\nAdditional work done on modeling include accounting for possible heat losses due\nto structural connections in a flight design and including the time-vary effects of\nthe heating environment while in orbit. Future tests with MLI and the integration of\nthe heat pipe with the HTS wire stack need to be conducted. For final validation, it\n\n\n\nElectromagnetic Formation Flight System Design 229\n\nis proposed to use a thermal vacuum chamber, to incorporate a sun and earth heat\nsource and include the radiator in the EMFF thermal system.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

To support the satellite development pro-\ncess, EADS Astrium Friedrichshafen has sponsored a Real-time Simulator (RTS)\ninfrastructure, which is used for test and design verification.\n\nThe Real-time Simulator is part of Astrium\u2019s Model-based Development and\nVerification Environment (MDVE) [3, 4], which is a real-time capable functional\nsimulation environment. The MDVE configuration used at the Institute of Space Sys-\ntems includes a Real-time Simulator and a Core Electrical Ground Support Equipment\n(EGSE). The latter is required to command the RTS and the simulated satellite. In the\ncurrent MDVE implementation the Core EGSE is substituted by the Mission Control\nSystem (MCS). The Real-time Simulator consists of four parts (Fig. 2):\n\n? the On-board Computer (OBC) Simulator,\n? the satellite equipment models,\n? physical models, which simulate the spacecraft dynamics or thermal aspects,\n? and the simulator kernel, which includes important low-level simulator functions\n\nlike the scheduler, the numerical solver and the Telemetry (TM)/Telecommand\n(TC) handler.\n\nPrior to this work, the Real-time Simulator at the Institute of Space Systems\nconsisted of an\n\n? initial version of the OBC and Power Subsystem models,\n? as well as of most of the Attitude Control System (ACS) sensors.\n\nThis paper discusses the extension of the existing MDVE RTS to a first functional\nstate. This includes the following steps:\n\n? As a basis for the integration of ACS control loops, ACS actuator models must\nbe created and the Environment and Dynamics Physical Models must be verified.\n\n? For conducting thermal simulations, a S/C thermal model must be created\nand verified. Additionally, thermal control system hardware models must be\nimplemented.\n\n? To enable simulation data processing and evaluation, the RTS as well as the\nsimulated S/C must be connected to a MCS.\n\nIn this paper the implementation of these steps is presented.\n\n\n\nPreliminary System Simulation Environment 233\n\nFig. 2 The Real-time Simulator structure\n\n2 Implementation\n\n2.1 Integration of the Environment and Dynamics Propagator\ninto the RTS\n\nThe environment and dynamics models have been sponsored by EADS Astrium\nFriedrichshafen and implement the RTS Environment and Dynamics Propagator.\nQuantities, which are calculated by the propagator, are accessible for all RTS models\nvia an environment and dynamics interface. For example a sensor equipment model\nis interconnected to the propagator via this interface to acquire data which is then\ntransmitted to the OBSW as measured sensor data. The ACS actuator models report\ntheir induced forces, torques and angular momentum to the propagator as input for\nthe integration of the S/C equations of motion. Figure 3 shows which propagator\nquantities are exchanged with the magnetic torquer and reaction wheel models. The\nEnvironment and Dynamics Propagator implements the environment models given\nin Table 1. These models may be enabled or disabled (except for the sun and moon\ngravitational effects) providing comparable functionality as the High Precision Orbit\nPropagator (HPOP) of the Satellite Tool Kit (STK) [5].\n\nAt simulator initialization, the propagator is characterized by data from the RTS\nconfiguration files as follows:\n\n? The environment models from Table 1 are initialized.\n? The simulation start time is set.\n? Initial position, velocity and attitude are set.\n? Satellite parameters like mass, moment of inertia matrix and geometry parameters\n\nare set.\n\n\n\n234 A.

Figure 4 illustrates the time dependency of the Longitude of Ascend-\ning Node acquired by an STK and an MDVE simulation. Data has been logged in\n10s intervals, which affects the calculation precision.\n\nFigures 5 and 6 represent a comparison of the orbit inclination and altitude\nacquired by both simulation environments. These show good agreement, which\ncertifies the Environment and Dynamics Propagator as suitable for ACS and orbit\npropagation within this project.\n\n2.2 Integration of the Thermal Propagator into the RTS\n\nThe Thermal Propagator consists of a thermal integrator, sponsored by EADS As-\ntrium, and a nodal thermal model. The propagator interacts with the equipment mod-\nels via a special Thermal Interface and integrates a system of energy conservation\nequations whose inputs are the solar, Earth infra-red and albedo heat fluxes as well\nas the dissipated power provided by the equipment models. The current implemen-\ntation of the Thermal Propagator supports only orbit-averaged solar, Earth infra-red\nand albedo heat fluxes, which are invariant with respect to the S/C attitude. The\npropagator\u2019s outputs are the nodal temperatures.\n\n\n\nPreliminary System Simulation Environment 235\n\nFig. 4 Time dependency of the orbits longitude of the ascending node for the Flying Laptop\nnominal orbit.

Brandt et al.\n\nFig. 6 Time dependency of the orbit altitude deviation for the Flying Laptop nominal orbit.\nComparison between the HPOP and the MDVE simulations\n\n2.2.1 Thermal Model\n\nThe thermal model describes the thermal properties of the S/C and is therefore the\ncoupling between the general purpose Thermal Propagator and the S/C under con-\nsideration. The thermal model is of a nodal type and consists of a reduced number\nof nodes to ensure low numerical complexity and thus the real-time capability of the\nRTS. In case of the Flying Laptop, 33 of these nodes model the S/C\u2019s equipment and\nstructure and one node represents the space environment [7]. The reduced number\nof nodes is achieved by assigning more than one piece of equipment to one thermal\nnode. To reduce modeling errors, attention has been paid that this node assignment\nis done for adjacent equipment. The node coupling network of the Flying Laptop\nMDVE thermal model is depicted in Fig. 7 for a constant sun-oriented S/C attitude.\nThe nodal discretization of the S/C causes that the resulting thermal conductive cou-\nplings are lower than the real ones [8]. Since the propagator is invariant with respect\nto the S/C\u2019s attitude, the nodal network cannot be adjusted to attitude changes dur-\ning simulation. The solid lines represent conduction couplings and the dashed ones\nrepresent radiation couplings. The couplings\u2019 values are calculated using analytical\napproximation expressions [8]. Only radiation conductors, which model incoming\nor outgoing heat fluxes, are shown. The internal radiation couplings are omitted to\nkeep the illustration concise. The incoming solar (S), earth infra-red (E) and albedo\n(A) heat fluxes are represented by three virtual nodes, which are not part of the nodal\nthermal model but are displayed for reasons of clarity. In contrast, node 34 absorbs\nthe outgoing heat fluxes and is part of the nodal model. Thermal simulations are\n\n\n\nPreliminary System Simulation Environment 237\n\nconducted and verified by comparison with I-deas NX software simulations [9].\nFigure 8 shows the temperature time dependency of the Payload, Core, and Service\nModules. The following differences can be observed:\n\n? The temperatures in the MDVE simulation are higher than in the I-deas NX simu-\nlation, because of the MDVE thermal model\u2019s lower resulting thermal conductive\ncouplings.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n9\n\n8\n\n76\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n19\n\n18\n\n17\n\n16\n\n15\n\n14\n\n13\n\n20\n21\n\n22\n\n29\n\n28\n\n27\n26\n\n25\n\n24\n\n23\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\nS\n\nE\n\n34\n\nA\n\nSolar Panel Left1\n\nSolar FluxS\n\nEarth Infra-red FluxE\n\nEarth Albedo FluxA\n\nSolar Panel Right\n\nSolar Panel Middle\n\nPayload Module\n\nCore Module\n\nService Module\n\nOptical Bench\n\nMICS\n\nTICS\n\nPanoramic Camera\n\nPrimary Mirror\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nSecondary Mirror\n\n7\n\n8\n\n10\n\n9\n\n12\n\n11\n\nUltra-stable Oscillator13\n\nOn-board Computer\n\nCommunication Box\n\nKa-band Box\n\nGPS Box\n\nFiber Optic Gyros\n\nReaction Wheels\n\nMagnetometer 0\n\nMagnetometer 1\n\nBattery\n\nPCDU\n\nMagnetic Torquers\n\n20\n\n21\n\n14\n\n15\n\n22\n\n24\n\n23\n\n19\n\n18\n\n17\n\n16\n\nHouse Keeping\n\nTraveling Wave Tube\n\nLow Power Amplifier\n\nStar Tracker\n\nPrimary Radiator\n\nSecondary Radiator\n\nMLI -X\n\nMLI +X\n\nMLI -Z\n\nDeep Space\n\n27\n\n26\n\n25\n\n29\n\n28\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n30\n\nThis internal node is only \nconnected to other nodes\nby radiation conduction\n\nRadiation Coupling\n\nConduction Coupling\n\nFig. 7 The Flying Laptop nodal thermal model\n\nFig. 8 Propagation of a temperature throughout the RTS to the MCS\n\n\n\n238 A. Brandt et al.\n\n? Generally, the MDVE features lower temperature amplitudes due to the\norbit-averaged thermal loads in this simulation.\n\n? The temperature amplitude of the Secondary Radiator in the I-deas NX simula-\ntion is much larger than the one in the MDVE simulation. It is assumed that this\nis also caused by the orbit-averaged thermal loads.\n\n? A gap between the temperatures of the MDVE Secondary Radiator and the tem-\nperatures of the Core Module can be observed, which is absent in the I-deas\nNX simulation. It is assumed that this is caused by the lower resulting thermal\nconductive couplings.\n\nSince the main objective of MDVE is system simulation and not detailed thermal\nanalysis, the results of the conducted simulations confirm the validity of the created\nthermal model despite the temperature differences.\n\n2.3 Equipment Models\n\nThe S/C is represented in the RTS by a number of equipment models, each of them\nmodeling specific equipment hardware. Each piece of hardware is implemented by\na single C++ class with a number of instances corresponding to the equipment\u2019s\noccurrence in the S/C. Initially, a Unified Modeling Language class diagram of the\nhardware equipment is created. This diagram contains information about the number\nof instances to be created from this class, about the number and type of the lines of\nthe simulated hardware harness as well as information about the model\u2019s monitoring\nvariables, which will later be accessible for monitoring and manipulation. From\nthis UML diagram an automatic source code generation tool creates the hardware\nmodel class framework. This equipment modeling approach results in identically\norganized and functioning class instances, representing multiple equipments of a\ncertain type. For example, in the Flying Laptop there are four identical momentum\nwheels, mounted in a tetrahedral configuration. From a modeling point of view,\nthe wheels\u2019 functionality is identical and the only difference between them is their\norientation and state at a certain point of time. By using a base class, the equipment\u2019s\nbehavior is implemented only once, while each instance is characterized at simulator\ninitialization via Extensible Markup Language (XML) configuration files. The XML\nfiles contain mission scenario data, which is acquired from the project\u2019s database.\n\nThe model\u2019s operation consists in the execution of the equipment functional\nmodel and interaction with the remaining equipment and physical models, as well as\nwith the RTS kernel (Fig. 9). The simulator kernel has direct access to the model\u2019s\nsystem variables (e.g. the model\u2019s clock) and is responsible for the logging of model\nspecific data. The equipment\u2019s functional model is executed by a fixed-increment\ntime advance mechanism (the simulator scheduler), whereby the model\u2019s state is\npropagated. The functional model consists of the discrete and the continuous models\nparts, the first one modeling the equipment\u2019s mode transitions and the second one\ncalculating continuous quantities. Signals (TM/TC, power supply) are transmitted\nvia the simulated model harness and data is exchanged with the propagators via their\n\n\n\nPreliminary System Simulation Environment 239\n\nFig. 9 Equipment model diagram\n\ncorresponding interfaces. As an example of how an equipment model operates, the\noperation of the reaction wheel model is explained in the following.\n\n2.3.1 Reaction Wheel Operation\n\nThe Reaction Wheel model class [6] is instantiated four times to realize the four\nreaction wheels mounted in the Flying Laptop. At simulator initialization, the model\nis characterized by parameters for:\n\n? the wheel momentum of inertia,\n? the nominal supply voltage,\n? the maximal motor current, torque and speed,\n? the wheel orientation in S/C body frame,\n? time constants,\n? and the model\u2019s initial operational mode.\n\nThe Reaction Wheel\u2019s functional model is realized by a discrete model part,\nwhich models the equipment\u2019s hardware and software states as well as by a con-\ntinuous part, which models the Reaction Wheel\u2019s dynamics. Each time the model is\ninvoked, its discrete model part acquires the model\u2019s input:\n\n? the supply voltage provided via two power lines by the Power Control and Dis-\ntribution Unit,\n\n\n\n240 A. Brandt et al.\n\n? the equipment\u2019s temperature,\n? and the induced failure modes.\n\nHaving completed this procedure, enough data is available to determine the\nequipment operational mode. The model\u2019s communication reception line is read\nout and the received commands are processed. Telemetry is sent to the OBC upon\nrequest via the model\u2019s transmission line and then the model\u2019s continuous part is\nexecuted. The latter integrates an adapted discretized Reaction Wheel SIMULINK\nmodel, developed during Phase A of the project. This model calculates, among\nothers, the wheel momentum, the induced torque and the consumed power, which\nare finally reported to the Environment and Dynamics Propagator and the Thermal\nPropagator respectively. This sequence of operations (except for the model\u2019s ini-\ntialization) is cyclically initiated by the scheduler to implement the models state\npropagation in time.\n\n2.4 Communication\n\nThe communication between the system simulator and the MCS consists of two\nmain aspects: a connection between the simulated satellite and the MCS making\nthe communication with the spacecraft possible during simulation, and a second\nconnection between the RTS and the MCS, which is used to command the RTS.\nThus the MCS is able to both operate the simulated satellite and to control the RTS\n(Fig. 10). The RTS allows failures to be induced into the simulation to test the On-\nboard Software (OBSW) performance in case of malfunctions [4].\n\nFig. 10 Data links between\nthe MDVE simulation and the\nMCS\n\nSimulated\nFlying\n\nLaptop\n\n.\n.\n\n.\n\nReal-time Simulator\n\nEnvironment\nModel\n\nDynamics\nModel\n\nThermal\nModel\n\nRTS Kernel\n\nRTS\nInfrastructure\n\nConnection\n\nMission Control System\n\nOBC\n\nSimulated TM/TC\nFront End\n\nIn conventional Software Verification Facility (SVF) implementations a dedi-\ncated OBC simulator exists [3], which features an integrated TM/TC front end for\n\n\n\nPreliminary System Simulation Environment 241\n\ncommunication with the MCS. The front end directly reads TM from and writes\nTC into the registers of the emulated OBC [4]. Since the Field Programmable\nGate Array (FPGA) OBC of the Flying Laptop prevents Direct Memory Access\n(DMA), a qualitatively different approach for the TM/TC front end integration is\ndeveloped [7]. The TM/TC will be transferred between the OBC model and a spe-\ncial equipment model, called \u201cTM/TC adapter\u201d. Together with a separate TM/TC\ntask, running parallel to the equipment simulation, the simulated TM/TC front end\nof the Flying Laptop RTS is realized. For commanding and telemetry processing,\nthe European Space Agency\u2019s SCOS 2000 software is used. SCOS\u2019s capability of\nhandling packets according to the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems\n(CCSDS) standard requires at present the simulated TM/TC front end to encapsulate\nthe Flying Laptop TM/TC packets using the Packet Utilization Standard (PUS). For\ninterfacing the MCS with the RTS and the simulated TM/TC front end, a program\ncalled SCOS RTS Proxy is used. It translates pure PUS packets into a format under-\nstandable for SCOS-2000. The proxy\u2019s functions consist in:\n\n? TM encapsulation\n\n? TM PUS packets into TM Transfer Frames\n? TM Transfer Frames into Network Controller and Telemetry Router System\n\n(NCTRS) TM Data Units\n\n? TC extraction\n\n? TC Transfer Frames from NCTRS TC Data Units\n? TC PUS packets from TC Transfer Frames\n\n? Routing of TC PUS packets to either the RTS kernel or to the simulated TM/TC\nfront end.\n\nSince the creation of the simulated TM/TC front end, the RTS is capable of\nhandling PUS packets. The creation of the SCOS RTS Proxy enables the com-\nmunication between the simulator (RTS kernel, simulated TM/TC front end) and\nSCOS-2000. The following example demonstrates the simulator data flow from the\nOBC to the MCS.\n\n2.5 Simulator Data Flow\n\nAs stated above, the OBC interfaces with the simulated TM/TC front end similarly\nto an equipment model. The resulting data flow is illustrated by the propagation of\ntemperature data to the MCS (Fig. 11). For each scheduled time step, the tempera-\nture of a thermal model\u2019s node is calculated by the Thermal Propagator and exposed\nwithin the Thermal Interface. The House Keeping (HK) unit, an equipment model\nwhich interfaces with the temperature sensors, queries the temperature from the\nThermal Interface and converts it into a measured voltage, since the real temperature\nsensors on-board the Flying Laptop will also output voltages. Then the HK sends\nthese cyclically to the OBC, which analyzes this data, creates the housekeeping\n\n\n\n242 A.

Fernandez-Saldivar\n\nAbstract A new compact and low-cost high spectral resolution imager for selected\nultraviolet bands is proposed to operate in a micro-satellite constellation with the\nobjective of monitoring important atmospheric constituents: sulphur dioxide (SO2),\nozone (O3) and aerosols. The spectral resolution and imaging performance of the\nsampled spectra are studied, given the distortions observed from different angular\nfields to estimate the slit function. Radiative transfer simulations using MODTRAN\nwith the derived resolution will show the differential radiances under various sce-\nnarios with SO2 \u201cclean\u201d and \u201ccontaminated\u201d atmospheres. The instrument design\nexploits the excellent response of new silicon carbide photodiodes in this region; its\nblindness to visible radiation provides for a relatively simple and compact optical\ndesign (9 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 6 cm). The use high-efficiency transmission gratings and 20-bit\nelectronics (consuming less than 5 W) offer high sensitivity. Other wavelengths out-\nside this region (331 nm and 360 nm) are sampled at a ground distance of 7\u00d732 km,\nso that the presence of aerosols may be detected, and the background UV albedo can\nalso be determined for retrieval algorithm purposes.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nCurrently observations in the UV region are restricted to large platforms and instru-\nments such as NASA\u2019s Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Ozone\nMonitoring Instrument (OMI) and ESA\u2019s Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment\n(GOME) and Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartog-\nraphy (SCIAMACHY). With the exception of TOMS, which was not designed to\nmonitor SO2 and still holds an unrivalled record in detecting volcanic activity [1],\nall the others face various trade-offs when observing the UV spectrum between\n300 and 315 nm wavelength. Because of the wide dynamic range of backscatter\n\nJ.A. Fernandez-Saldivar\nSurrey Space Centre, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK\ne-mail: j.fernandez@surrey.ac.uk\n\nR.

Fernandez-Saldivar\n\nradiation observed, it is common to optically split this region in to two ranges and\nuse detectors with differing sensitivity (Fig. 1 Left), thus degrading the signal to\nnoise ratio. This split occurs precisely in a region where the SO2 absorption features\nprovide easier discrimination with respect to O3 and this can lead to problems in the\nretrieval algorithms.\n\n2 Spectral and Radiometric Analysis\n\nThe spectral range and resolution required to discriminate SO2 from O3 is defined by\nthe absorption spectra of these trace gases. In the region between ?300 and 320 nm\nSO2 absorption is greater than O3 (Fig. 1 Right). However it is below ?313 nm, where\nthe ozone absorption is smooth, that SO2 features are more easily identifiable for\ndiscrimination.SO2 showsawave-likespectrumwithpeaksandtroughsevenlyspaced\nevery ?1 nm (spectral sampling) and with an estimated Full Width Half Maximum\n(FWHM) of ?0.4 nm (spectral resolution). We can therefore use these peaks and\ntroughs to obtain information on the ratio of SO2 to O3 (Fig. 1 Right inset). Above\n?313 nm the features would require higher spectral sampling and resolution.\n\nFig. 1 (left) UV channel overlap for GOME [2]. (right) absorption cross sections for SO2 at\n243K [3] and O3 at 241K [4]. (right Inset) ACS ratio of these constituents for discrimination\n\nIn order to estimate the radiometric resolutions required, a radiative transfer\nmodel was computed using MODTRAN [5] under these conditions: Tropical At-\nmospheric standard profiles, no aerosols, no clouds and solar angle of 25 degrees.\nAtmospheres with three ozone concentrations were analysed, each \u201ccontaminated\u201d\nwith an SO2 layer of varying concentration at 4 km scale height (Fig. 2).\n\nBy taking the ratios of radiances obtained by from the atmosphere with varying\namounts of SO2 and O3 with respect to those obtained from a standard no-clouds\ntropical atmosphere (no SO2, and 277 DU of Ozone), we can observe the different\nspectral signatures of these trace gases. As expected from its Absorption Cross Sec-\ntion we observe in Fig. 3 the jagged behaviour of SO2 (Left) compared to the smooth\n\n\n\nA Miniaturised UV Imaging Spectrometer for Remote Sensing of Atmosphere 247\n\nFig. 2 Radiative transfer simulations for SO2 contaminated atmospheres under 3 different O3\nconditions\n\nFig. 3 Radiance ratio w.r.t. tropical atmosphere (left) atmosphere affected by SO2 (right) affected\nby O3\n\ncurves due to O3 (Right). These features will allow the discrimination of these two\ngases using retrieval techniques such as the Band Residual Difference algorithm [6].\n\n3 Instrument Design\n\nThe instrument was designed to obtain a ground sample distance at nadir of\n4 \u00d7 30 km; this is considered useful according to the Disaster Management Support\nGroup (DMSG) of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) suggest-\ning 10 to 20 km [7]. The calculated spatial resolution is half the area covered by a\nnormal OMI pixel (12 \u00d7 24 km) and 20 times smaller than TOMS (50 \u00d7 50 km); it\nis expected to minimise cloud cover scenes and increase the sensitivity in detecting\n\n\n\n248 J.A. Fernandez-Saldivar\n\nSO2 contaminated pixels. A medium swath (?300 km) for a single imager would\nrequire the use of two imagers in order to observe large drifting clouds and reduce\nthe revisit time; it would also match the Disaster Monitoring Constellation of micro-\nsatellites imager pair swath [8]. The challenging requirements of the application\nsuch as: wide dynamic range and low-noise demand an extremely low circuit noise\nmatched to a highly sensitive detector to ultimately define the system sensitivity.\nFor this purpose a low power (<5 W) electronic solution comprising a switched\nintegrator and 20-bit Analog-to-Digital converter in a miniature device is proposed.\n\n3.1 Optics\n\nTheoptical layoutwaschosentohaveminimumnumberofpartswhilstmaximisingthe\noptical throughput (etendue). It uses the largest commercially available holographic\ntransmission grating, matching it with a custom-made area array of Silicon Carbide\n(SiC) photodiodes at the focal plane. The use of fused-silica lenses will provide good\ntransmission and performance in the UV, and some optical surfaces have an aspherical\ndesign to minimise distortions. The optical design was optimised around the central\nwavelength at 310 nm because of the critical requirements in this region. The perfor-\nmance of auxiliary channels is not as critical because the spectral resolution needed in\nthose channels is not as demanding as in the continuous region. The layout proposed\nis shown in Fig. 4 below. On top we observe the three main optical rays of the three\nwavelength regions, 360 nm, 331 nm and 305\u2013315 nm (left to right.)\n\nFig. 4 Optical layout\n\n3.2 Grating and Detector\n\nTwo key elements were the main drivers of the design: the transmission grating size\n(15\u00d720 mm) and the pixel size of the photodiode array (0.4\u00d70.6 mm). Transmission\n\n\n\nA Miniaturised UV Imaging Spectrometer for Remote Sensing of Atmosphere 249\n\ngratings with high efficiency will provide the spectral dispersion required. An area\narray of Silicon Carbide (SiC) photodiodes is proposed because it is naturally blind\nto visible radiation. The combination of these two yields the spectral resolution and\nsampling required for the application. This is observed in Fig. 5, which shows the\nspectral imaging characteristics at the focal plane with its relative illumination and\nspectral resolution.\n\nFig. 5 (left) Spectral imaging at focal plane. (right) spectral resolution at 11 wavelengths\n\nOne area array of SiC photodiodes consisting of 10 \u00d7 10 pixels is proposed for\nthe 10 contiguous channels (305\u2013315 nm). Two linear arrays of 10 \u00d7 1 pixels will\nbe used in the auxiliary channels 331-nm and 360-nm for determination of ozone\nproducts, aerosols and UV albedo.\n\nThe spectral imaging of all channels is shown in Fig. 6 below for the chief rays\npassing through the centre of the entrance pupil. A grid distortion is observed on\nall 3-wavelength ranges and a spectral \u201csmile\u201d causes the image to curve up as it\napproaches the edges of the detector arrays. However, this distortion is minimal for\nthe chief rays.\n\nFig. 6 Spectral imaging at focal plane.

The real IFOV of the\n\n\n\n250 J.A. Fernandez-Saldivar\n\nspectrometer is 12.7? however a wider view is tested to test for influence on the\nspectral characteristics. This is shown in Fig. 7 for the chief rays (left) and for all\nrays including marginal rays (right).\n\nFig. 7 Spectral imaging illumination @ 310 nm (left) \u00b12? fields. (right) \u00b112.7? fields\n\nSlicing the above relative illumination images vertically at 10 different loca-\ntions corresponding to the detector array columns, we obtain a Gaussian-like curve\n(Fig. 8).\n\nFig. 8 Full width at half maximum (FWHM) @ 310 nm (left) \u00b12? fields. (right) \u00b112.7? fields\n\nOnce the real FWHM defined by the slit function has been obtained for all fields\nin the focal plane, the radiance ratios are computed by convoluting the spectral ra-\ndiance with the appropriate slit function. The inclusion of marginal rays reaching\nthe edge of the entrance pupil Fig. 9 (right) shows the reduction in the apparent\n\u201cmodulation\u201d of the spectrum, with respect to that obtained with the chief rays alone\n(left). The Left graph is representative of the very best performance we could expect\nfrom the instrument on the optical axis, whereas the Right graph is representative of\nthe overall instrument performance.\n\nThe marginal ray analysis allows determination of spectral and spatial distor-\ntions in terms of variations in the expected FWHM and the relative position of the\nwavelengths as the marginal rays reach the edge of the entrance pupil (Table 1).\n\nThe changes in relative intensity are a result of vignetting; however the absolute\nexpected levels of radiance should still meet the optical signal requirements of the\nalgorithm (0.01 ?W cm?2 sr?1 threshold). The widening of the FWHM and the re-\nsulting offset will combine to degrade the sensitivity at the edges of the FOV. However,\nit is proposed to use two instruments in a similar way to the way the DMC imagers are\noperated, giving an optical axis which is tilted ?12? off-nadir. This counteracts the\ndegradation to some extent over the central portion of the image. At the edge of the\nswath of the imaging pair, the lack of sensitivity will greatly reduce the performance.\n\n\n\nA Miniaturised UV Imaging Spectrometer for Remote Sensing of Atmosphere 251\n\nFig. 9 Radiance ratio w.r.t. tropical atmosphere (left) \u00b12? fields with FWHM = 0.57 nm.

On the auxiliary\nchannels (331 nm and 360 nm) the performance is degraded due to the widening\nof the slit function. This occurs because the optical design is aimed at producing\nthe best optical performance at the shorter wavelengths which have lower radiances.\nHowever, despite this compromise, the overall instrument performance of the instru-\nment meets the requirements of the application in mind.

The\ndemanding requirements to consider when designing such a system were shown\nindicating the potential of such instruments to successfully detect and discriminate\ntwo important trace gases: SO2 and O3. The auxiliary channels may also be used to\ndetermine the concentration of aerosols.\n\nThe optical design and its spectral imaging properties across its field-of-view\nwere discussed together with the requirements of various atmospheric scenarios and\nimaging characteristics. The instrument imaging performance fulfils the application\nneeds according to radiative transfer simulations of realistic atmospheric scenarios.\nThe detection limits, based on the expected detector performance, are aimed ideally\nto observe minor concentrations of SO2 produced by passively outgassing volcanoes\n?5 DU and certainly should be capable of monitoring volcanic events releasing\n>10 DU. However, the real detectivity will be defined once the noise performace of\nthe electronics have been tested and verified.\n\nThe relatively low-cost and small size of the instrument proposed makes it a\nsuitable instrument for a micro-satellite-based atmospheric remote sensing mission.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Main objective of BeeSat is the on-orbit verification of miniaturized\nreaction wheels suitable for pico satellites which have been developed with our main\nindustrial partner Astro- und Feinwerktechnik Adlershof GmbH [2]. Work is done\nto provide a number of additional pico satellite technologies. This paper outlines\nmotivations for equipping a pico satellite with an attitude determination and control\nsystem (ADCS) based on reaction wheels. BeeSat\u2019s ADCS is exposed briefly along-\nside some of the solutions the research team at TU Berlin developed. A sun sensor\nsystem based on Position Sensitive Detectors is introduced, a new design principle\nfor magnetic coils is explained and the Microwheel system is displayed.\n\n1 Introducing Pico Satellites\n\nAt TU Berlin good experiences with micro satellites have been made. The se-\nries of TUBSAT [3] micro satellites has shown remarkable results and provided\nstudents with hands-on experience ever since the micro satellite TUBSAT-A was\n\nM.

Regarding the overall increase in capability, performance and\nefficiency of electronics pico satellites become a more and more serious subject to\nresearch.\n\nCubeSats [4] are pico satellites, which means, that their total mass may not ex-\nceed 1kg. They have a cubic shape and standardized outer dimensions of 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7\n11.3cm3. Furthermore they have to meet special requirements to ensure the safety\nof launch vehicle and primary payload. Those limitations make it hard to realize\nfeatures already taken for granted on larger satellites but on the other hand offer\nuniversities cheap and easy access to space.\n\nTechnologies for pico satellites can be used on larger satellites as well, one ex-\nample being the reaction wheel developed for BeeSat which can easily be equipped\nwith a larger flywheel mass and then meet the needs of nano satellites.\n\n2 Beesat\u2019s Goals\n\nThe goals of the BeeSat project can be divided into three different groups:\n\n2.1 Technology Demonstration\n\nFirst and foremost BeeSat is a technology demonstration and evaluation satellite\nplatform. The main goal is the on-orbit verification of newly developed reaction\nwheels for pico satellites. On the side of the ADCS also a new design principle\nfor magnetic coils is evaluated as well as a sun sensor system based on Position\nSensitive Detectors (PSD). Technologies tested on BeeSat also include: An in-house\ndeveloped on-board computer, modified transceivers, a power control and distribu-\ntion unit. The dependable operating system and middleware TinyBoss [5] developed\nfor BeeSat eases programming and adds to overall security.\n\n2.2 Widening the Field of Possible Pico Satellite Applications\n\nDue to limited technological resources only few applications are suitable for the\ncurrent generation of pico satellites. Acquiring technologies for pico satellites also\nmeans enabling them to fulfill the more demanding missions already envisaged at\nTU Berlin [6]. Possible applications and capabilities include:\n\n\u2013 Occultation measurement\n\u2013 Remote sensing and target pointing with one or more satellites\n\u2013 High bandwidth communications\n\u2013 Constellations\n\u2013 Formation flight\n\n\n\nBeeSat Attitude Determination and Control System 257\n\n2.3 Student Education\n\nDuring numerous seminar papers and diploma theses students already have gained\nvaluable experiences regarding mission analysis and satellite design. Once launched\nBeeSat will also serve as a means of teaching satellite operation.\n\n3 Design Principals\n\nBuilding a CubeSat means that a number of limitations will be encountered during\nsatellite development. Outer dimensions of 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 11.3cm3 limit the room avail-\nable within the spacecraft and put harsh limits on the overall energy consumption\nof the satellite. The mass limit of 1kg has also shown to cause many difficulties. In\norder to fulfill BeeSat\u2019s goals under the limitations of the CubeSat standard a couple\nof design principals have shown to be useful.\n\n3.1 Use of Commercial of the Shelf Parts\n\nLatest commercial of the shelf (COTS) parts often have better electrical, mechanical\nand monetary properties than their already space-proven counterparts. Due to their\nusually short life cycles (BeeSat is designed for one year of operation) and limited\nresources in space and energy, pico satellites can and have to take use of COTS\ncomponents. Often they have to be adapted and always be qualified before being\nflown within the satellite. Another advantage of this strategy is that this valuable\npossibility for on-orbit verification of small parts can also help funding the satellite\nmission. BeeSat\u2019s sun sensor system (see Section 4.3) is a good example of a COTS\npart adapted to fulfill important tasks during a pico satellite mission.\n\n3.2 Functional Integration Rather than Subsystem Separation\n\nEnabling one assembly unit to fulfill a number of tasks means saving manpower\nduring development as well as valuable mass and volume on the satellite. Due to its\nthin (1 mm) outer structure with many cut-outs BeeSat needs a structural fortifica-\ntion altering the natural frequency and adding to overall rigidity. This fortification\nalso holds and isolates batteries so that they do not suffer from space conditions.\nFurthermore it serves as shielding for radiation sensitive parts of the on-board com-\nputer and provides various mounting points.\n\nThe printed circuit boards (PCB) (see Fig. 4) on each side of the satellite also\nfulfill a number of tasks within different subsystems. The magnetic coils for attitude\ncontrol are printed within those boards; they also hold sun sensors and their aper-\nture plates and electronics. Furthermore each PCB also holds solar cells for energy\ngeneration.\n\n\n\n258 M. Herfort et al.\n\n4 Attitude Determination\n\nBeeSat will be equipped with a unique ADCS. Most of its parts were newly designed\nin order to provide future missions with the necessary hardware to fulfill more de-\nmanding tasks. During the TUPEX [7] experiment BeeSat\u2019s attitude sensors have all\nbeen successfully tested on a suborbital flight of the Rexus sounding rocket. Figure 1\nshows TUPEX\u2019 main board and outboard plate containing sun sensor system and\nsolar cell.\n\nFig. 1 TUPEX Experiment main board and outboard plate after recovery\n\n4.1 Magnetic Field Sensor System\n\nTwo magneto-resistive magnetic field sensors, each measuring in three axes, will be\nused on BeeSat. An applied magnetic field changes resistivity within the sensor so\nthat output voltage is proportional to the magnetic field. Once measured the mag-\nnetic field vector can be compared with the output of a reference model (IGRF10-13)\ncalculated on-board the satellite in order to derive the satellites attitude.\n\n4.2 Gyros\n\nGyros of appropriate size, weight and power consumption for pico satellites with a\nmeasurement range suitable for satellite operations are not available yet. Gyros used\nfor BeeSat have a range of \u00b1 150?/s while the predicted angular rates do not exceed\n5?/s. They will be used as additional reference and for tests at high rotation rates\nnecessary for verification of the Microwheel system.\n\n4.3 Sun Sensor System\n\nThe sun sensor system developed for BeeSat consists of six Position Sensitive De-\ntectors (PSD) each covered with an aperture plate. One is placed on each side of the\nsatellite in order to calculate the sun vector in body-fixed frame.\n\n\n\nBeeSat Attitude Determination and Control System 259\n\nIncident sunlight passes through the aperture plate and shows up as a spot on\nthe surface of the PSD. A photo current is generated and split up to each side\nof the sensor, the magnitude depending on the distance between spot of incident\nsunlight and each side contact. The currents are transformed to voltages, amplified\nand measured. Through combination of all sun sensor measurements the direction\nof incident sunlight with respect to the satellite is derived. The on-board navigation\nsystem (ONS) delivers a sun vector in inertial reference frame. Both vectors can be\ncompared in order to obtain attitude information. Figure 2 shows a sectional view\nof the aperture plate with subjacent sensor and sunspot.\n\nFig. 2 Sun sensor and\naperture plate\n\nFig. 3 Pinhole in aperture\nplate\n\nDuring tests an accuracy of 1.5? has been reached after calibration. In order to\nreach better results a new aperture plate has been built. Other than the first version\nwhich had only a drilled hole here the aperture is angled at 120? and fabricated\nmuch more precisely. The outside of the aperture plate is polished while the inside is\nanodized in order to prevent scattered light. A scanning electron microscope image\nof the pinhole can bee seen in Fig. 3.\n\n\n\n260 M.

A pair of two coils is mounted in\neach axis to allow redundant operation. The main tasks of the coil system are coarse\nthree-axis stabilization of the satellite body and the desaturation of accumulated\nangular momentum within the reaction wheels.\n\n5.1 Hardware Design\n\nThe coil is embedded within a printed circuit board of seven layers, instead of wind-\ning the wire into a coil. One coil is able to generate a magnetic dipole moment of\n0.03Am2, which corresponds to a maximum torque of approximately 1 \u00b7 10?6Nm at\na power consumption level of 0.2 W. This innovative design approach seen in Fig. 4\nmakes the mounting devices conventionally needed to patch the winded coil on the\nbus frame, unnecessary. Furthermore this design is cost reducing for the coil can be\nmanufactured at once with the other circuits. Also this design method prevents the\ncoil from shortcuts because the windings are not insulated by epoxy enamel but are\nfixed in the circuit board with a defined distance and is therefore more robust. One\ndrawback may some loss of the inducible dipole moment due to the spiral form of\nthe circuit path, which has to be compensated by an increased number of windings.\n\nFig. 4 Magnetic coil on PCB\n\n\n\nBeeSat Attitude Determination and Control System 261\n\n5.2 Coil Control Algorithms\n\nBdot controller\nThe well known B? algorithm (1) has been implemented for detumbling and at-\n\ntitude stabilization as well as for desaturation of reaction wheels. The B? algorithm\nonly requires knowledge of the current magnetic field and its derivative to dissipate\nthe rotational energy stored in satellite bus or reaction wheels.\n\nRmCoil = ?K \u00b7R B? ? mc (1)\n\nWith RmCoil being the generated dipole moment in body frame, K the scalar gain\nfactor, R B? the time derivate of magnetic dipole in body frame and mC the constant\ndipole offset for steady state orientation.\n\nFig. 5 Simulation results of Bdot controller (left) and PD controller (right)\n\nPD Controller\nDue to the fact that force cannot be generated alongside the earths magnetic field\n\nvector the coil system is not able to perform full three-axis attitude control. A PD\ncontroller [8] has been implemented to overcome this limitation. Using one reaction\nwheel and at least two coils in the remaining axes three-axis attitude control can\nperformed even if one wheel looses functionality.\n\nRmCoil,X = 1R By (Kz \u00b7 ?error + Kzd \u00b7 ??error )\nRmCoil,Y = 0\nRmCoil,Z = ? 1R By (Kx \u00b7 ?error + Kxd \u00b7 ??error )\n\n(2)\n\nR?W heel,y = ?(RmCoil,Z R Bx ?R mCoil,X R Bz) + (Ky \u00b7 ?error + Kyd \u00b7 ??error ) (3)\n\nHere Kx , Kxd , Kz , Kzd are scalar gain factors, R B stands for the earth\u2019s magnetic\nfield in body frame, ?error , ??error , ?error , ??error represent the current error angels\nand R?Wheel is the torque generated by a reaction wheel.\n\n\n\n262 M. Herfort et al.\n\n6 Microwheel System\n\nBeeSat\u2019s important task is the on-orbit verification of newly developed reaction\nwheels. In a partnership with Astro- und Feinwerktechnik Adlershof GmbH and\nfunded by the DLR (FKZ 50JR0552), reaction wheels with brushless motors have\nbeen developed especially to the needs of pico satellite developers.\n\nFig. 6 Laboratory model of the Microwheel system\n\n6.1 Technical Properties\n\nBrushless motors and a special bearing system are used for the Microwheels.\nWith a total mass of 114.5 g, a torque of 4\u00b710?5Nm per wheel and a maxi-\n\nmum power consumption of 1 W for the complete Microwheel system including\nthe wheel drive electronics the qualification model of the reaction wheels exceeds\nthe characteristics reached by the development model of Astro and TU Berlin. The\nsmall moment of inertia (1.17\u00b710?5kg\u00b7m2) is sufficient for pico satellites, it adds to\noverall accuracy while the high revolution speed of up to 16000 RPM still allows\nabsorption of an angular momentum that equals BeeSat rotating at 7?/s. To allow\neasy adaptability for different missions or larger satellites the flywheel mass can be\nexchanged. A laboratory model of the Microwheel system including the wheel drive\nelectronics can be seen in Fig. 6.\n\n6.2 Microwheel Control Algorithms\n\nThe Microwheel system is controlled through a number of different linear single\ninput/single output controllers for inertial pointing, earth pointing and large angle\nmaneuvers. They consist of a state regulator and integrator as seen in equation (4).\nState variables are reconstructed through the state observer seen in Fig. 7.\n\n??MW = ?K \u00b7 x?(t) + Ki\n?\n\ne(t)dt (4)\n\n\n\nBeeSat Attitude Determination and Control System 263\n\nController output is the desired wheel acceleration and its integral the target\nwheel speed. Matrix K is the state space control and x?(t) are reconstructed state\nvariables. Ki is the integrator gain, e(t) is the control error.\n\nFig. 7 Control loop\n\nFigure 8 shows a simulated large angle maneuver over 60? in all three axes at the\nsame time with a constant disturbance of 1.85\u00b710?7Nm. Oscillation during ascent\nand overshooting can be attributed mainly to coupling effects.\n\nFig. 8 Simulated large angle maneuver\n\n7 Summary\n\nWithin the BeeSat project a number of components and strategies are evaluated in\norder to acquire pico satellite technologies. It\u2019s ADCS contains reaction wheels de-\nveloped for pico satellites, a sun sensor system based on PSDs as well as a magnetic\ncoil system on PCBs.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Miller\n\nAbstract The Satellite Position Hold Engage Reorient Experimental Satellites\n(SPHERES) program, developed by the MIT Space Systems Laboratory, began\noperations aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on May 2006. SPHERES\nwas designed as a research facility to demonstrate metrology, control, and auton-\nomy algorithms for distributed satellites systems. By operating in the risk-tolerant\nenvironment of the ISS, SPHERES allows researchers to push the limits of their\nalgorithms. Five test sessions, conducted during 2006, achieved multiple objectives\nfor the different areas under study. The first test session was dedicated to hardware\ncheckout. The second test session demonstrated basic 6DOF closed-loop control of\nthe satellites. Fault detection and isolation algorithms were also tested, successfully\nusing the inertial measurement system to detect simulated faults in space. Formation\nflight tests during the fourth and fifth session demonstrated two types of control ar-\nchitectures. Following the principle of incremental algorithm development, demon-\nstrations of multiple scenarios of spacecraft docking occurred during test sessions\none through four; the last session demonstrated docking to a tumbling spacecraft.\nThe results of these test sessions are the basis upon which substantial more research\nwill be conducted in the following years.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe MIT Space Systems Laboratory developed the Synchronized Position Hold En-\ngage and Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) program to incrementally\nmature algorithms for Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS) in a microgravity envi-\nronment. SPHERES was specifically designed to help develop algorithms relevant\nto guidance, navigation, and control of the spacecraft of distributed satellite sys-\ntems.

Saenz-Otero, D.W. Miller\n\nto represent the dynamics of complex missions while operating in a risk-tolerant\nenvironment. As such, SPHERES allows scientists to push the algorithms to their\nlimits in various realistic mission scenarios, learning about both their theoretical and\nphysical limitations.\n\n1.1 Motivation\n\nThe motivation for SPHERES arises from the need to mature estimation, control,\nand autonomy algorithms for upcoming distributed satellite systems programs. Dis-\ntributed satellite systems utilize multiple small satellites to achieve the same goals\nas a single larger satellite would. DSS trades control complexity with the expense\nand limitations of launch vehicles to send large single satellites to space. DSS in-\ncludes proposals to use multiple spacecraft to implement reconfigurable space-based\nradar [1], autonomous docking of spacecraft for re-supply (e.g. Orbital Express [2])\nand/or assembly (e.g. the Vision for Space Exploration inter-planetary stacks[3]),\nand the use of separated spacecraft telescopes (e.g. ESA\u2019s Darwin [4] and NASA\u2019s\nTPF [5]) to capture the light of distant planets.\n\nThe transition from theory to application has been shown to be a challenging\nprocess, but one that is necessary[6]. Traditional algorithm development methods\nwhich use simulations or ground-based facilities (see [7] for a complete review) do\nnot provide either the fidelity or time necessary to mature an algorithm. While some\nof the upcoming missions are termed as \u201cdemonstration mission\u201d, their cost prohibits\nscientists from actually testing algorithms on them. Therefore, a need exists to pro-\nvide scientists with a development facility which closely simulates the operational\nenvironment without having the risks associated with the planned high-cost missions.\n\n1.2 Design Principles\n\nBased on substantial previous experience in the development of space technology\nmaturation laboratories [8], the MIT Space Systems Laboratory created a design\nphilosophy [4] which was followed in the design of the SPHERES program. The\ndesign of the project was based on the need to support the incremental maturation\nof a wide range of algorithms that encompass a field of study in a risk-tolerant and\nrepresentative environment.\n\nThe principle of incremental algorithm maturation prescribes that algorithm de-\nvelopment should consist of multiple steps that grow upon each other. This requires\nplanning a set of tests which will demonstrate separate parts of an algorithm and\nthen bring them together to demonstrate the whole. In the case of autonomous con-\ntrol for DSS, it calls for the demonstration of individual maneuvers during initial\ntests, followed by larger tests that combine the maneuvers for a high-level goal. The\nlong-term life and reprogramming capabilities of the SPHERES facilities enable\nscientists to run individual tests as necessary and combine the resulting algorithms\nin subsequent test sessions.\n\n\n\nInitial SPHERES Operations Aboard the International Space Station 269\n\nThe principle to encompass a field of study calls for a facility to support enough\nresearch so that all the areas necessary to demonstrate a complex task can be demon-\nstrated. For example, fields of study such as formation flight or autonomous ren-\ndezvous require the study of areas such as estimation, controls, and autonomy. The\navailability of standard modules for these areas and reprogramming capabilities of\nSPHERES enables scientists to concentrate on their specific area within DSS.\n\nThe requirement to allow testing in a risk-tolerant environment exists in order\nto enable scientists to push the limits of their algorithms. A practical algorithm\ndevelopment facility does not restrict the user due to the potential of permanent\ndamage/failure of the facility due to an algorithm. Rather, the facility allows scien-\ntists to push their algorithms to the limits in such a way that a failure of the algorithm\ncan be clearly observed and evaluated. By operating under human supervision in the\ncontrolled environment of the ISS, SPHERES enables scientists an unprecedented\nlevel of risk-tolerance.\n\nLastly, the goal for operating in a representative environment arises from the\ndesire to mature algorithms to ever-higher technology readiness levels (TRLs, [9]).\nIn order to demonstrate that an algorithm has reached readiness, TRLs emphasize\nthe need to operate in a \u201crelevant environment\u201d \u2013 for space applications this means\noperations in 6DOF. SPHERES enables operations in true micro-gravity, allowing\nthe maturation of algorithms to TRL 6 or even 7.\n\n2 Overview\n\nThe SPHERES laboratory for Distributed Satellite Systems [10] consists of a set\nof tools and hardware developed for use aboard the ISS and in ground based tests.\nThree micro-satellites, a custom \u201cglobal metrology\u201d system (based on ultrasound\ntime-of-flight measurements which simulates GPS inside the testing volume), com-\nmunications hardware (two RF channels), consumables (tanks and batteries), and\nan astronaut interface are aboard the ISS. Figure 1 shows the SPHERES satellites\n\nFig. 1 SPHERES hardware components operating aboard the ISS (Picture courtesy of NASA)\n\n\n\n270 A. Saenz-Otero, D.W. Miller\n\nbeing operated aboard the ISS and identifies the different elements of the facility.\nThe ground-based setup consist of another set of micro-satellites, a research oriented\nGUI, and the guest scientist program to allow multiple researchers to use the facility.\n\nThe SPHERES satellites were designed to provide the best traceability to pro-\nposed formation flight missions by implementing all the features of a standard\nthruster-based satellite bus. The satellites have fully functional propulsion, guid-\nance, communications, and power sub-systems. These enable the satellites to ma-\nneuver in 6-DOF, to communicate with each other and with the laptop control sta-\ntion, and to identify their position with respect to each other and to the experiment\nreference frame. The laptop control station is used to collect and store data as well\nas to upload control algorithms to the satellites.\n\n3 ISS Test Sessions\n\nFive test sessions were conducted aboard the ISS during 2006: May 18, May 20,\nAugust 12, August 19, and November 11. Table 1 presents the primary objectives\nfor the first five test sessions The following sections describe each test session in\nfurther detail to illustrate the ability of SPHERES to both meet its design principles\nand help advance our understanding of algorithms required for successful future\nDSS programs.\n\nTable 1 Test sessions 1\u20135 objectives\n\nSession Objectives\n\n1 \u2022 Hardware checkout\n\u2022 Open-loop control, 3DOF closed-loop rotations, and basic maneuvers towards\n\ndocking\n\n2 \u2022 Firmware fix (from session 1)\n\u2022 DOF closed loop rotations; fault detection and isolation (FDI) of simulated\n\nthruster failures; position hold, and autonomous docking translation maneuvers\n\n3 \u2022 Autonomous docking to a fixed beacon\n\u2022 On-line calculation of the mass and inertia of the satellite (Mass-ID)\n\u2022 Two satellite initial tests: formation flight (3DOF slave/master) and docking\n\n4 \u2022 Global metrology system checkout\n\u2022 Show \u201cavoidance\u201d trajectories\n\u2022 Two satellite formation flight: 6DOF slave/master\n\u2022 Initial tests of two satellites docking\n\n5 \u2022 Continue tests for Mass-ID\n\u2022 Cooperative and uncooperative docking and \u201csafe docking\u201d\n\u2022 Peer-to-peer formation flight maneuver\n\n\n\nInitial SPHERES Operations Aboard the International Space Station 271\n\n3.1 First Test Session\n\nThe SPHERES First ISS Test Session took place on 18-May-2006. The hardware\ncheckout objectives were successful as all the SPHERES hardware (satellite, bea-\ncon, beacon tester, laptop transmitter and consumables) was located, installed and\noperated. Data was collected during open-loop tests to evaluate the performance\ndifferences between two different mixer algorithms that convert force and torque\noutputs by control algorithms into thruster on/off time commands. Enough data was\ncollected to validate the operation of the global metrology system. The primary\nobstacle during the first test session was a corrupted FLASH memory space on the\nsatellite which stored the IMU bias and scale factors. The corrupted FLASH pre-\nvented closed-loop tests from performing correctly. Despite this issue, the successful\noperation of the hardware and interfaces, as well as the collection of a substantial\namount of data resulted in an overall successful test session. Table 2 presents a\nchronological list of all the tests performed during the first Test Session. The table\nshows the inability to complete closed loop tests during this test session. It also\nshows how the SPHERES team planned the incremental collection of data to val-\nidate the system in such a way that future test sessions will benefit from the tests\non this session. Further, the ability to recover from these issues demonstrates the\nrisk-tolerant nature of SPHERES.\n\nTable 2 First test session tests\n\nTest Description Result\n\nT 1 (2\u00d7) Quick checkout with IMU data download Success\nT 2 Open-loop rotations, old mixer Success (low gas pressure)\nT 3 Open-loop rotations, new mixer Success (low gas pressure)\nT 4 Beacon track attitude PD Metrology data collection only\nT 6 (4\u00d7) Closed-loop XYZ rotation FLASH corruption error\nT 8 (2\u00d7) Dock Free Short S#1 PD Metrology data collection only\nT 2 Open-loop rotations, old mixer Success (full gas pressure)\nT 3 Open-loop rotations, new mixer Stopped inadvertently by crew\nT 3 Open-loop rotations, new mixer Success (full gas pressure)\nT 8.3 Dock Range only S#1 FLASH corruption error\n\n3.2 Second Test Session\n\nThe SPHERES Second ISS Test Session took place on Saturday 20-May-2006. The\nsession successfully accomplished a majority of its objectives. The FLASH mem-\nory corruption exhibited during the first test session was fixed. Furthermore, several\ntests involving closed-loop control using the gyroscopes and the ultrasonic naviga-\ntion system were successful. The data show the ability of the SPHERES satellite\nto perform closed-loop 3D rotations, to estimate its 6DOF position with respect to a\nSPHERES beacon, and to detect faults online using fault detection and isolation (FDI)\n\n\n\n272 A. Saenz-Otero, D.W. Miller\n\nalgorithms. The tests which had estimator divergence during this session provided\nenough data to overcome the issue in future sessions. This test session demonstrated\nthe risk-tolerance of SPHERES by simulating thruster failures without any doubt\non the ability of the satellites to continue operations after such failures. Further, it\nshowed the ability to run tests in multiple research areas by showing both control\n(closed loop 6DOF), estimation (using a single beacon) and autonomous FDI.\n\nTable 3 Second test session tests\n\nProgram Test Description Results\n\nP101 T 1.1 (6\u00d7) Flash Memory Test Communications initialization problem\nT 6 (4\u00d7) Closed-loop XYZ rotation Communications initialization problem\nT 1.1 Flash Memory Test FLASH fixed\nT 6 Closed-loop XYZ rotation Success\nT 14 (2\u00d7) De-Tumble, Track, Estimator diverged\n\nand Dock\nT 16b Dock Fixed Long S#2 PD Partial success (wrong initial conditions)\n\nP112 T 1 Failed-on thruster FDI Lost communications\n(NASA T 1 Failed-on thruster FDI Success\nAmes)\n\nT 2 Failed-off thruster FDI Success\nT 3 (2\u00d7) Multiple thruster FDI Lost communications\nT 3 Multiple thruster FDI Success\nT 4 Closed-loop attitude Success\n\ncontrol\nT 5 FDI with attitude control Success\n\nP113 T 1 Quick checkout Lost communications\nT 2 Basic Position Hold Lost communications\nT 2 Basic Position Hold Success\nT 15 Attitude path following Success\nT 3 Stationkeeping 3D \u2013 1 Success\nT 8/8.1 (3\u00d7) De-tumble, Track, & Dock Reset due to low battery (good start)\n\n3.3 Third Test Session\n\nThe SPHERES Third ISS Test Session, on Saturday 12-Aug-2006, demonstrated\nmultiple steps towards autonomous docking, collected initial formation flight data,\nand taught the SPHERES team about important environmental noise factor. As\nshown in Table 4, tests were not repeated as often as before. On the other hand,\nmany tests were affected by infrared noise; this issue was corrected for future ses-\nsions. The first set of tests demonstrated individual maneuvers towards autonomous\ndocking and path-based trajectory following. The second set began the use of two\nsatellites for formation flight and docking. Throughout these tests, state information\nwas successfully transmitted between satellites.\n\n\n\nInitial SPHERES Operations Aboard the International Space Station 273\n\nTable 4 Third test session tests\n\nProgram Test Description Results\n\nP124 T1 Quick Checkout IR Noise\nMIT T2 3D Position Hold with Disturbance IR Noise\nDocking T2 3D Position Hold with Disturbance Good estimation, but IR Noise\n\nT3 Docking PD (1.5 m) Success\nT4 De-tumble, Track, & Dock Set 1 Success\nT5 Trajectory 3 (Safety w/rotation) Good control\nT6 3D Position Hold (Robust) Started well, estimator diverged\n\nP126 T1 ID all axes Stuck thrusters\nMass ID T2 ID all axes, proof mass No \u201cproof mass\u201d attached\n\nT2 ID all axes, proof mass Stuck thrusters\nT3 Single-thruster, proof mass IR Noise\nT4 Single-thruster firings IR Noise & stuck thrusters\nT4 Single-thruster firings Partial success\nT5 Fuel slosh Partial success\nT5 Fuel slosh Partial success\nT6 Roll-Pitch-axis spin Success\nT7 Pitch-Yaw-axis spin Stuck thruster\nT8 Yaw-Roll-axis spin Partial success\n\nP125 T1 Quick Checkout IR Noise\nMIT T2 Twin Rotations: Independent SN2: success / SN3: low battery\n2 Sat T2 Twin Rotations: Independent Success\nInitial T3 Twin Rotations: Formation Success\nTests T4 Twin Position Hold: Formation Estimator diverged (IR Noise)\n\nT5 Two Satellite Docking \u2013 Set 1 Drifting \u201ctarget\u201d prevented docking\n\nOf special interest in this session were the results of multi-satellite operations.\nFigure 2 shows the attitude of independent rotations (left side) and formation flight\nrotations (right side, \u201cleader\u201d on top). During independent rotations the satellites\ndid not react to disturbances (in this case IR noise) on the other satellite. During\nformation flight reaction to external disturbances by the crew (green spike) can be\nseen at the end of the formation flight tests.\n\n3.4 Fourth Test Session\n\nThe fourth Test Session, on 19-Aug-2006, was dedicated primarily to testing the\nglobal metrology system. Table 5 shows the two main groups of tests conducted\nduring this session. The tests in the first group collected all the data necessary to\ndevelop the robust estimators later used in the fifth and subsequent test sessions;\nalthough a configuration problem prevented online estimation from succeeding.\nThe second set of tests (once the configuration problem was corrected) was highly\nsuccessful, and provided important demonstrations.

Figure 3 presents the trajectory followed\n\n\n\nInitial SPHERES Operations Aboard the International Space Station 275\n\nby the chaser (blue) satellite while the target (red) satellite maintained a constant\nrotation and actively held its position with respect to the global frame (ISS frame).\nOne can see a spiral forming in the path of the blue satellite. This success is the\nresult of the incremental development and maturation of algorithms throughout the\nprevious sessions. While only a few tests were run during this session (shown in\nTable 6), each of the tests is of high complexity. The tests demonstrated complete\ndocking algorithms and full formation flight operations. These tests clearly demon-\nstrate the ability to incrementally maturate algorithms and to cover a field of study\nby developing multiple areas (specifically controls, estimation, autonomy, and new\nto this session communications). Further, the risk tolerant nature of SPHERES en-\nabled the team to test these complex algorithms after just four prior test sessions in\nmicrogravity (less than 12 hours/seven months of microgravity experience).\n\nFig. 3 Results of docking to\na tumbling target\n\nTable 6 Fifth test session tests in chronological order\n\nProgram Test Description Results\n\nP142\nMass ID 2\n\nT1-12\n(15 runs tot)\n\nMultiple tests for Mass ID Partial \u2013 stuck thrusters were not fully\nidentified from previous session\n\nP141 T1 (3\u00d7) Quick Checkout Incorrect battery installation\nMIT 5: T1 Quick Checkout Success\nDocking T2 Docking to Fixed Target Success\nMulti-Sat T6 Docking to Tumbling Target Success\n\nT6 Docking to Tumbling Target Success\nT5 Safe Docking w/fault Success\nT4 Safe Docking Success\nT12 Circular Formation Flight Success\n\n\n\n276 A. Saenz-Otero, D.W. Miller\n\n4 Conclusions\n\nSPHERES has demonstrated its ability to create a laboratory environment aboard\nthe space station for the incremental maturation of DSS algorithms. The first four\nsessions helped the SPHERES team achieve steady-sate operations, having fully\nunderstood the microgravity capabilities and behavior of the facilities and the ISS.\nUsing the data collected from each test session, the SPHERES team incrementally\nmatured formation flight and docking algorithms resulting in multiple \u201cspace firsts\u201d.\nSPHERES was the first free-flyer to operate aboard the ISS. On the second test ses-\nsion it was the first space program to intentionally simulate failures of thrusters in\nspace in order to test fault detection algorithms. During the fifth session SPHERES\nwas the first to demonstrate docking to a tumbling target in a microgravity envi-\nronment. The circular formation flight was another first (demonstrate covering an\noptical field in a micro-gravity environment with separated spacecraft), although\nthere were synchronization problems that prevented the test from being fully suc-\ncessful, so it requires further research. SPHERES is expected to operate aboard the\nstation for multiple years to complete these tasks and more.\n\nReferences\n\n1. A. Das, R. Cobb, M.

Lura, B. Biering, H.G. Lo?tzke, H. Studemund, and V. Baturkin\n\nAbstract Microsatellite BIRD (Bispectral InfraRed Detection) with mass 92 kg\nand overall sizes 0.55 \u00d7 0.61 \u00d7 0.62 m operates in a sun-synchronous orbit more\nthan 5 years. The temperature range ?10 . . .+30?C for payload with average power\nabout 35 W and peak power of 200 W in observation mode, continuing 10\u201320 min,\nis provided by passive thermal control system (TCS). Operation of TCS foresees a\nthermal stability of payload structure by use of heat transfer elements \u2013 conductors\nand grooved heat pipes, thermally jointing the satellites segments. Two radiators,\nmultilayer insulation (MLI) and low-conductive stand-offs provide the required\ntemperature level. Review of TCS performance is based on an analysis of daily\ntelemetric data, collected by 33 temperature sensors and power consumption. The\nanalysis includes the definition of minimal, maximal and averaged temperatures of\nsatellite main units and comparison with designed parameters. TCS successfully\nsupports the required temperature level of satellite components during the whole\nperiod of exploitation.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe main features of BIRD (Bispectral InfraRed Detection), having launched on\n22nd October 2001 by PSLV-C3 Indian rocket and operating till now (nominal\noperation time is 1 year) in the sun-synchronous 568 km orbit, are presented in [1],\n\nF.

Lura et al.\n\nand the description of thermocontrol system and some summaries \u2013 in [2, 3]. This\nsatellite is intended to demonstrate in space new compact infrared imaging sensor\ntechnologies and the approach to modular design of a microsatellite. The BIRD\nmicrosatellite is a cubic shaped, 3-axis stabilized microsatellite without a propulsion\nsystem. The mechanical structure (satellite bus) is designed as a three-boxes cubic\nmain body, and consists of the service segment, the electronic segment and the pay-\nload platform (Fig. 1). The main body is covered with MLI except the instruments\nwindows and 2 radiators. One fixed and two deployable solar panels as well as the\nreject mechanism are mounted to the body.\n\nThe payload is mounted to the special payload platform, which makes about 1/2\nof the body volume and 1/3 of the total mass of the spacecraft. To keep the line of\nsights of the instruments very stable, the payload platform is connected deformation\nfree with the lower satellite segments. The heat transfer from (or to) the payload\nplatform to (from) the main radiator on the bottom side of the service segment in\n+Y \u2013 direction is realized by two heat pipes [4]. The heat removal from the IR\ninstrumentation is realized to the separate IR \u2013 radiator, positioned in ?Y direction.\nBIRD TCS is designed as a passive, when a heat rejected by radiators, through MLI\nand devices windows is compensated by inner heat generation. The temperature\nlimits of major satellite units are typical for space components [3]. The solar panels\ngenerate about 40 W each and 8 NiH2-cells can accumulate 240 W?h to supply up\nto 200 W in peak power during 20 min observation.\n\n2 BIRD Thermal Regime in Flight\n\nThe temperature measurements are performed by 33 temperature sensors of the\ntype AD590 (by Analog Devices, USA). The sensors have been spread over the\nsatellite structure, payload instruments, housekeeping equipments and solar panels\n(see Fig. 1).\n\nThe temperature telemetry covers the most of satellite operation time\n(about 98%). Figure 2 illustrates the volume of a daily collected thermal telemetry\n(in DOS format) during 2001\u20132006 years, where daily averaged telemetry is 4.2 Mb.\nThe typical period of temperature data gathering is 30 sec with the storage period\nof 24 hours (near 15 orbits). During the day the temperatures of satellite units have\nthe evident periodic character similar to the radiator (see Fig. 3) that deals with\nnon-uniform external condition for the main radiator along the orbit and tight ther-\nmal contact between radiator and other units, which are thermally connected by two\nheat pipes.\n\nThe on-orbit temperature variation for radiator is about 1\u20133.5?C, for payload\nplatform less than 1?C. Sometimes the radiator has the rise of the temperature\ndue to satellite manoeuvres as shown in Fig. 3 after 12:00. Solar panels, which\nhave essentially less thermal mass, are directly illumined by sun flux, and therefore\nthey have the widest range of temperature excursions. The central panel, which is\ncooled from one side, has the maximal temperature 75 . . . 90?C and minimal ?20 . . .\n? 40?C in shadow (Fig. 3). The side panels ?X and +X (two sides radiate) have\n\n\n\nBIRD Microsatellite Thermal Control System \u2013 5 Years of Operation in Space 279\n\nSTBS01\nBattery Stack 1\n\nSTBS02\nBattery Stack 2\n\nSTMP01\nMain Plate 1\n\nSTMP02\nMain Plate 2\n\nSTMP03\nMain Plate 3\n\nSTPS01\nMagnetometer\n(behind WAOSS)\n\nSTPS02\nTransverse Structure\n\nSTES01/STES02\nSBC-A/SBC-B\n\nPTPB01\nPDH BOARD 1\n\nPTPB02\nPDH BOARD 2\n\nSTES04\nTransmitter 1\n\nSTES03\nTransmitter 2\n\nSTSS01\nStar Sensor 1\n\nSTSS02\nStar Sensor 2\n\nWTSN01\nSensor module\n\nWTCB02\nControl Box\n\nITHM01\nIRM Head\n\nITHL03\nIRL Head\n\nITEM02\nIRL Head\n\nITEL04\nIRL Head\n\nSTSA01-\nSTSA12\nSolar panels\n\nIMTM00/IMTC00/ILTM00/ILTC0 \nIRL/IRM Int.

BIRD thermal conception, foreseeing the combination of active thermal con-\ntrol and deep cooling of IR sensors with the passive thermal control for all\n\n\n\n284 F. Lura et al.\n\nother devices and housekeeping components, has proved itself during on-orbit\nexploitation from October 2001 \u2013 till now\n\n2. Thermal unification of geometrically stable and thermal conductive payload plate\nand main radiator by heat pipes allows to minimize the influence of a displace-\nment of satellite shell and reduce the on-orbit temperature variations due to in-\ncrease of the thermal mass. This principle may be useful for design of satellites\nequipped with precision optical devices\n\n3. The NiH2 batteries have not individual cooling system and have been thermally\nattached to the main radiator. This approach has greatly simplified the design af\nthermal control and makes it cheaper\n\n4. The passive thermal concept is sensitive to values of heat generation, MLI per-\nformance and external heat fluxes. The shifting of temperature level in the case of\nnecessity can be realized by changing of on-board power, positioning of radiator\nwith respect to the Earth and Sun.\n\nContacts\n\nAuthors are interested in exchanging of information in the field of small satellite\nthermal design/ modeling/ on-ground verification.

Both parameters are driven by the satellite orbit, the number\nof satellites within the constellation and the number and location of the ground sta-\ntions. Regular larger time gaps between imaging and data download to the ground\nstation occur for such satellite systems and are unacceptable for both parameters\nin terms of security relevant Earth observation. This behaviour can be improved by\nincreasing number of satellites or the usage of data relay satellites, however both\nsolutions are expansive ones. Therefore a patent pending procedure was developed\nas a low cost possibility to improve the operational performance. The procedure is\ncalled \u201cMailbox Ground Station\u201d.\n\nThe procedure uses a dedicated additional ground station, optimized located to\nthe satellite constellation. Normally the polar region will be preferred for constella-\ntions with polar orbits. The Mailbox ground station will be used as an intermediate\ndata download, storage and upload facility. The presentation will demonstrate and\nexplain easily the Mailbox ground station system using a fictional satellite constel-\nlation used for Earth observation purposes.\n\n1 Operational Key Requirements\n\nIn the use of satellites for earth observation, users frequently wish to have the fastest\npossible access to image data residing in a satellite. Especially for security relevant\nEarth observation like crisis/catastrophe monitoring and reconnaissance the length\n\nB.

Zehetbauer\n\nof time between satellite commanding respectively the pick-up of the image data\nand availability of image product is a key requirement for these missions.\n\nThe length of time between the pick-up of the image data and the availability\nof the image product is referred to as the \u201cage of information\u201d. Together with the\nsystem response time the image information age is a key requirement for these mis-\nsions. Figure 1 shows the definition of these important parameters.\n\nFig. 1 Definition of system response time and image information age\n\n2 Operational Performance Driver\n\nIn many satellite missions, it has up to now been customary that the user is located in\nthe data receiving station of the respective satellite and has to wait until the satellite\nhas moved into the receiving range of the antenna. Since the possibility to contact\nthe satellite will exist only during the period when the latter is flying over the ground\nstation, a disadvantage of this method resides in the large time gaps in which no\ncontact is possible between the ground station and the satellite and the data age is\nadversely affected thereby.\n\nAnother presently available method for quicker access to image data residing in\na satellite consists in the use of existing ground station receiving networks. In this\nmethod use can be made of antenna installations distributed worldwide. An example\nhereof is the \u201cIGS (International Ground Stations) \u2013 Network\u201d for the Landsat 5 and\nLandsat 7 satellites, which network makes it possible to receive image data on many\nplaces worldwide.\n\nThe purpose of such networks is the in-situ reception of data by geographically\nwidely distributed users, also with the possibility of data transfers between the par-\nticipating stations. The onward conveyance of the satellite data between a reception\nsite and a user is performed by data transmission via terrestrial data lines or by\ncommunication satellites.\n\nThe disadvantages of using ground station networks of the above type become\napparent in cases where no geographically widespread user groups are involved or\n\n\n\nThe \u201cMailbox Ground Station\u201d 287\n\nwhen classified, safety-relevant (military) data have to be transmitted. The establish-\ning of such a geographically widespread data receiving network for individual user\nwill, however, entail considerable costs. This applies particularly to safety-relevant\ndata of earth observation satellites wherein a tap-proof, access-protected onward\ntransmission between a receiver station and a user must be safeguarded.\n\nWhen considering, at the same time, the high data quantities which may be in\nthe order of magnitude of several gigabits per image product, the use of public\nnetworks (Internet) has to be excluded. As a consequence, an expensive installation\nof terrestrial data routes or the use of high-cost data channels via communication\nsatellites will be necessary.\n\nHigh expenses for the establishing of suitable terrestrial data connections are to\nbe expected particularly if, due to marginal conditions related to the mechanics of\nsatellite routes, the satellite receiving system is located at sites on the surface of the\nearth which are problematic regarding their geographic accessibility.\n\nThe above is true particularly of the near-pole regions in the area of the north and\nsouth poles which are considered as particularly suitable locations for the placement\nof receiving antennae for earth observation satellites since there, due to the inclina-\ntion of the orbit normally provided for this type of satellites, a contact possibility\nexists virtually during each orbit cycle around the earth.\n\n3 Mailbox Ground Station\n\nIn the following a new method for reducing information age will be presented avoiding\nthe disadvantages of the data transfer concepts mentioned before. For reaching this\naim a special way of using a dedicated ground station called Mailbox ground station\nis proposed. Preferably the method can be applied to satellite constellations on high\ninclined orbits.\n\nThere will be required orbits arranged in close proximity to the poles to thus\nmake it possible to determine a smallest possible geographic region which all of the\nsatellites of the constellation can fly over at the smallest possible intervals, i.e. \u2013 if\npossible \u2013 during each orbit cycle around the earth. In case of satellites on near-pole\norbits, i.e. on orbit planes with an inclination of about 90? relative to the earth\u2019s\nequator, such regions can be determined as sections delimited by near-pole circles\nof latitudes, with the north or south pole each time forming the centre.\n\nThe size of these surfaces will depend on the extent to which the inclination of\nthe satellite orbit planes deviates from 90?. In the ideal case of a polar orbit having\nan orbit inclination of 90?, the region flown over by all earth observation satellites\non each of their orbits around the earth will be reduced to a point, notably the north\nand south poles. For a constellation wherein all earth observation satellites have the\nsame orbit inclination, differing from 90?, the geometric shape which is flown over\nby each earth observation satellite during each orbit cycle will be a circle (circle of\nlatitudes). If the constellation consists of earth observation satellites having different\ninclinations, the corresponding above-mentioned region will be a spherical segment\nof the earth\u2019s surface delimited by two circles of latitudes.\n\n\n\n288 B. Brand, T. Zehetbauer\n\nRegarding the definition of the above described regions (point, circle, spherical\nsegment), what is to be observed is always the normal projection of the satellites\nonto the rotating surface of the earth. Additionally, as an effect of minor influence,\nit is to be noted that the orbit plane of satellite orbits will over time tend to rotate\nabout the north/south pole axis relative to a reference system fixed in space, which\neffect is caused by the uneven mass distribution within the earth\u2019s globe.\n\nA feature resides in the arrangement, additionally to the user ground station, of\na further ground station, referred to hereunder as Mailbox ground station, for data\nconnection to the earth observation satellites in the above described region which\nis flown over by preferably all earth observation satellites at brief intervals. By this\nspecial arrangement of the Mailbox ground station, it is now made possible to es-\ntablish a connection to virtually each earth observation satellite of the constellation\nduring each orbit cycle.\n\nIn case that, for technical and/or financial reasons, it should not be possible to\narrange the Mailbox ground station in the described region which is flown over by\nall earth observation satellites at brief intervals, also other regions can be selected\nfor the Mailbox ground station. This, however, has the disadvantage that in this case\nnot each orbit cycle performed by the earth observation satellites can be utilized for\na data connection. Thus, there should always be selected a region which is suitable\nto be flown over by as many earth observation satellites as possible and at intervals\nas short as possible. For the near-pole satellite orbits as commonly used for earth\nobservation missions, these regions are located in geographic areas with preferably\nhigh altitudes.\n\nThe Mailbox ground station is positioned in such a manner that, during fly-over\nby one or a plurality of earth observation satellites, it will be possible both to receive\nthe image data residing in the earth observation satellite(s) and to transmit the data\ntemporality stored in the Mailbox ground station to selected earth observation satel-\nlites of the constellation. By the arrangement of only one Mailbox ground station\nin a region which is flown over preferably by all earth observation satellites of the\nconstellation at brief intervals, there is no need anymore for the above-described\nexpensive use of ground stations distributed world-wide, nor will there be the re-\nquirement to perform a likewise expensive and technically complex data transfer\nfrom these stations to the user.\n\nFurther there are preferably required different node positions of the individual\nsatellite orbit planes. A node position describes the position of the virtual piercing\npoints of the satellite orbits through the equator plane and, in combination with\nthe above-described inclination, describes the position of the satellite orbit plane in\nspace. By suitable selection of the node position when designing a satellite route,\nit can be determined at which times certain regions on the earth\u2019s surface will be\nflown over.\n\nA further problem resides in the sometimes very long connection gaps between\nan earth observation satellite and the user ground station, which can be in the range\nof ten hours and more. These gaps are largely caused by the relative movement\nbetween the earth observation satellite on its orbit plane and the surface of the earth\nwhich due to the earth\u2019s rotation is turning under the satellite.\n\n\n\nThe \u201cMailbox Ground Station\u201d 289\n\nIn case of the above described contact gaps, it may happen that, under the effect\nof the earth\u2019s rotation, the user ground station and consequently the spatial receiving\nrange of this station have moved into such a far distance from the satellite orbit plane\nthat the earth observation satellite is not capable anymore during its orbiting to get\ninto the receiving range of the user ground station.\n\nThe influence of the drift of the satellite orbit plane caused by the uneven mass\ndistribution of the earth\u2019s globe, which drift is relatively small in comparison to\nthe earth\u2019s rotation, is negligible with regard to the subsequent considerations be-\ncause, during the time periods of relevance here, it will lead to merely insignificant\nshiftings between an earth observation satellite and a receiving range of the ground\nstation.\n\nBy suitable selection of the orbit nodes for the individual earth observation satel-\nlites of the constellation, the individual orbit planes can be arranged to the effect\nthat, provided that the number of satellites is sufficient, in the ideal case there will at\nall times one or a plurality of earth observation satellites flying through the receiving\nrange of the user ground station during their orbiting movement. Should the number\nof satellites be too small, it is at least possible to reduce the time periods during\nwhich none of the earth observation satellites in orbit can contact the user ground\nstation.\n\nThe Mailbox ground station will be used for intermediate storage of the image\ndata of an earth observation satellite of the constellation which currently has a re-\nduced possibility to contact the user ground station; thus, these image data can then\nbe transmitted to another earth observation satellite of the constellation which, when\nnext having the occasion to contact the user ground station, will provide an image\nwhose data age is satisfactory to the user.\n\nFigure 2 is a schematic representation of the geometric conditions and the partic-\nipating components for a constellation comprising three earth observation satellites\non different orbit planes, a user ground station and the Mailbox ground station. In\nfour steps the sequence of target access by satellite 1 and data download to the user\nby satellite 2 is shown. Dependent on target coordinates a significant improvement\nof image information age can be achieved by using this procedure.\n\nA central component is the Mailbox ground station which is located on the sur-\nface of the earth and serves for intermediate storage of the data received from earth\nobservation satellites flying across the respective region. The intermediate storage\nof the data has to be maintained until the earth observation satellite selected for\nonward transmission of the data will fly over the Mailbox ground station.\n\nApart from the data store, there is provided a data receiving unit and a data trans-\nmission unit, consisting of receiving hardware and transmission hardware, respec-\ntively, and preferably a common antenna. The receiving and the transmitting of the\ndata is started respectively in response to commands predetermined for use between\nthe Mailbox ground station and the earth observation satellites and can be realized\nin a fully automated manner, thus offering also the option to use an unmanned and\nthus economically advantageous Mailbox ground station. To avoid costs for setting\nup the Mailbox ground station particularly in polar regions, one can use the existing\ninfrastructure of ground stations in these geographic regions.\n\n\n\n290 B. Brand, T. Zehetbauer\n\nFig. 2 Geometric conditions for Mailbox ground station concept\n\nIn case that, for technical or financial reasons, it should not be possible to arrange\nthe Mailbox ground station in the described region which is flown over by all earth\nobservation satellites at brief intervals, also other regions can be selected for the\nMailbox ground station. This, however, has the disadvantage that in this case not\neach orbit cycle performed by the earth observation satellites can be utilized for a\ndata connection. Thus, there should always be selected a region which is suitable\nto be flown over by as many earth observation satellites as possible and at intervals\nas short as possible. For the near-pole satellite orbits as commonly used for earth\nobservation missions, these regions are located in geographic areas with preferably\nhigh altitudes.\n\n4 Simulation\n\nFor demonstration the effect of improvement for image information age which can\nbe achieved by using the Mailbox ground station procedure a simulation result is\npresented here. The scenario selected is determined by a 6-satellite constellation\nwith an inclination of 98.1? and an orbit altitude of 681 km (IKONOS orbit parame-\nters). Figure 3 presents the scenario start configuration including the data receiving\n\n\n\nThe \u201cMailbox Ground Station\u201d 291\n\nareas of the user- and the Mailbox ground station. In this simulation Svalbard is\nselected for Mailbox ground station and the user ground station will be located at\nWeilheim (DLR).\n\nFig. 3 Scenario start configuration for simulation\n\nThe result for image information age reduction which will be realized for a se-\nlected target is shown in Fig. 4. It should be mentioned that the influence of the\nMailbox station on image information age reduction strongly depends on the image\ntarget location. For a given scenario defined by satellite constellation and ground\nstations those geographical areas can be determined which will profit from Mailbox\nstation procedure.\n\nFig. 4 Example for image age reduction\n\n\n\n292 B. Brand, T. Zehetbauer\n\n5 Conclusion\n\nIn contrast to previously employed methods performed by using only one (user)\nground station or using worldwide networks of ground stations, the long connection\ngaps occurring are avoided along with their negative influence on the age of the\nimage information. Besides improvement for image information age the Mailbox\nground station can also be used for reducing the command time.\n\nFurther, the need for relay stations or special terrestrial data connections between\nthe ground stations or the worldwide network and the user ground station is obviated\nand also the confidentiality of the data is safeguarded because the data do not have\nto be transmitted via public networks. About this the usage of easy adaptable and\ncommercial available hardware is possible and there is no need for expensive space-\nhardware like dedicated (high data rate) communication satellites or data-interlink\nsystems.\n\n\n\nA Software-Defined Radio Approach\nfor the Implementation of Ground\nStation Receivers\n\nJyh-Ching Juang, Chiu-Teng Tsai, and Jiun-Jih Miau\n\nAbstract As many pico-esats will be released in one launch, the closeness in spatial\nand spectral separation between different pico-sats may render problems for ground\nstations in satellite tracking. We implement a ground station receiver with software\ndefined radio (SDR) approach to solve this problem. In the SDR, bandpass sam-\npling is used to down convert RF signal. Single antenna interference cancellation\n(SAIC) technique with Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Estimator (MLSE) algo-\nrithm is used to cancel interference. Doppler shift for transmitter is estimated based\non received signals. The SDR-based ground station provides a receiver capable of\nreceiving multi-channel, flexible data rate, flexible modulation type, with co-channel\ninterference (CCI) cancellation capability.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nRecently, many pico-sats and/or small satellites have been developed and planned\nto be launched to take advantage of short development time, miniature devices,\nstandard launcher interfaces, and piggy-back launch opportunities. Many missions\nincluding collaborative earth observation can be realized through the design of pico-\nsats and their constellation. However, a problem associated with the pico-sat oper-\nations is that the communication frequencies, typically in the UHF/VHF band, are\nvery close between two different pico-sats. As many pico-sats will be released in one\nlaunch, the closeness in spatial and spectral separation between different pico-sats\nmay render problems for ground stations in satellite tracking, especially in the early\norbit phase. Even when there is a contact, it may be difficult for a participating\nground station to distinguish the satellite that is being pointed at by the ground\n\nJ.-C.

The station may have to resolve the desired signal out of a class\nof near-by interferences. Also, the frequency overlap due to Doppler shift, clock\ndrift and operation error aggravate the tracking problem. Indeed, if the contact with\na satellite is interrupted by such errors, the station may have to search the signal\nagain, which is highly time-consuming. Giving the very limited contact time of\nLEO satellites, the tracking of a cluster of satellites may be extremely challenging.\n\nTraditional ground station receivers are typically implemented by commercial\namateur radios. The signal received is down converted to intermediate frequency\n(IF) by mixers and demodulated by a TNC modem. Then, ground station PC deals\nwith the digital signal to decode the telemetry information. The architecture\u2019s weak-\nness is that the channel number is limited to be one or two channels per receiver.\nAnd the modulation method and data rate is often fixed. If a user wants to change the\ncapability of a ground station, change of hardware, either through installation of new\nequipment or tuning of dials/buttons, is necessary. Such a hardware approach may\nbe costly and inflexible to operate. These situations need to be improved in order to\nhave better mission performance. A feasible strategy is to employ a software-defined\nradio (SDR) approach to implement the ground station receivers. In this paper, a\nSDR architecture is proposed and developed. The resulting ground station receiver\nconstitutes an antenna, A/D converter and processing software to acquire, process,\nand decode radio signals. The key for the successful acquisition and tracking of mul-\ntiple radio signals lies in the use of processing software. In the paper, the processing\nsoftware is described and its performance against conventional receivers is assessed.\n\n2 Architecture\n\n2.1 Hardware\n\nFigure 1 shows the architecture of the SDR-based receiver. One antenna receives\nthe RF signals. Broadband selective antenna is suitable to receive several satellite\nbands and reject other bands. An antenna with amateur radio VHF/UHF and ISM\n2.4GHz band is considered. Due to weak signal and system noise factor, an LNA is\nput near to the antenna output port as possible. Then, a filter is designed to suppress\nnoise and prevent aliasing. The A/D converter digitizes the incoming signals into\ndigital samples. This differs from the conventional approach in which mixers and\ndown-converters are used to render IF signal. Conventional ground stations process\nintermediate frequency (IF) signal and decode by a TNC modem. The SDR-based\nreceiver performs the remaining signal reception and processing tasks using soft-\nware in a computer.\n\n2.2 Signal Processing Procedure\n\nThe RF signal from satellites must be down converted to IF signal. Instead of using\nmixers, the SDR-based receiver utilizes A/D converter and band pass technique\n\n\n\nA Software-Defined Radio Approach for the Implementation of Ground Station Receivers 295\n\nLNA Filter\n\nA/D\nConverter STFFT\n\nFilter\n\nDoppler Shift\nCalculator\n\nTransmitter\nFrequency Tunning\n\nMLSE \nEstimator Data Decoder\n\nFilter\n\nFilter\n\nFilter \u2026\n\u2026\n\nMLSE \nEstimator\n\nData Decoder\n\nMLSE \nEstimator Data Decoder\n\nMLSE \nEstimator\n\nData Decoder\n\nComputer\n\nFig. 1 Architecture of the SDR-based ground station receiver\n\n[1, 6]. The latter allows the use of a low sampling rate device to process high\nfrequency signals. In the approach, the sampling frequency is selected as 20 MHz\nso as to accommodate different frequency and the associated Doppler variation of\ndifferent satellites with a communication frequency in the range of 140?150 MHz\nand 430?440 MHz.\n\nThe digitized IF samples that are available at the A/D converter output may con-\nsist of signals from a cluster of satellites together with noise and interferences. A\nsoftware processing algorithm is needed to extract the signal from a certain pico-sat.\nBecause the bandwidth is wider in SDR than that in traditional receivers, the noise\neffect in SDR is also more severe. For a certain signal, other pico-sats\u2019 signals and\nother illegal amateur radio users\u2019 signal are regarded as interferences. As a result,\nthe interference issue can not be neglected.\n\nA Short-Time FFT (STFFT) is used to track the variation of the frequency as\na function of time. The width of the Short-Time FFT window needs to be well-\nconsidered to have a suitable frequency resolution and time resolution. STFFT with\nwider window has better frequency resolution and worse time resolution; in con-\ntrast, STFFT with narrower window has better time resolution and worse frequency\nresolution. As the Doppler shift due to satellites is not fast, the time resolution is\nspecified as 10 second. The frequency resolution becomes 100 Hz, given the afore-\nmentioned sampling frequency. Through the STFFT, the spectrum can be obtained.\nIf the strength of the signal at a certain frequency is greater than the threshold, a\nsignal is detected. Consequently, the frequency information, includes the frequency\nvariation of each working channel, can be utilized to form the digital window and\n\n\n\n296 J.-C. Juang et al.\n\nexecute the tracking loop. In parallel, several digital filter windows are implemented\nto suppress the noise. The center frequency of each filter window is the same as\nevery peak\u2019s frequency in the spectrum. And the bandwidth of every filter window\nis 20 kHz, the same as the bandwidth for the narrow frequency modulation commu-\nnication in amateur radio band.\n\nAs a cluster of satellites are in presence, the frequencies of two or more channels\nmay overlap occasionally. In addition, illegal ground-based users may interfere the\nchannel. The co-channel interference (CCI) increases bit error rate (BER) signifi-\ncantly [3, 9]. CCI can be cancelled by the single antenna interference cancellation\n(SAIC) technique [5, 7] for ground stations with one antenna only, or by implemen-\ntation multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technique [8] at ground stations with multi\nantennas. The Maximum-Likelihood Sequence Estimator (MLSE) algorithm [2] is\nknown to be capable of handling CCI in SAIC. The desired signal under interfer-\nences can be represented as\n\nr [k] = A1[k]e j?1[k] + A2[k]e j?2[k] + N [k] (1)\n\nwhere Ai [k] and ?i [k] is the amplitude and phase of the i-th signal at time kTs ,\nrespectively. Ts is the sampling period. The Viterbi estimation method [4] is used\nto determine the maximum likelihood estimate of (?1[k], ?2[k]). The computation\ntrellis has 64 states, and the trace back depth is 32. Although this method cannot\ncancel the interference perfectly, the BER has been improved. Figure 2 depicts the\nsuccessive CCI cancellation architecture.\n\nFig. 2 Successive CCI cancellation architecture\n\nAfter the interference cancellation stage, the signal output from the MLSE esti-\nmator is decoded as digital code, 1 or 0. The data stream from the satellite is then\nbe obtained.\n\n\n\nA Software-Defined Radio Approach for the Implementation of Ground Station Receivers 297\n\n3 Simulation Result\n\nTo assess the interference cancellation performance, simulations are performed. The\ncondition of the simulation assumes that the IF is 1 MHz with 1200 bps AFSK\nsignal. Figure 3 shows the simulated BER at IF 1 MHz with 1200 bps AFSK sig-\nnal, without Doppler shift. Figure 4 further shows the simulated BER at IF 1 MHz\nwith 1200 bps AFSK signal and Doppler shift with variation 20 Hz per second. The\nDoppler shift condition is selected for usual pico-sat tracking condition.\n\nFig. 3 Simulated BER without Doppler shift\n\nFig. 4 Simulated BER with Doppler shift\n\n\n\n298 J.-C. Juang et al.\n\nThe simulation results entail that the proposed CCI scheme running under as\nSDR architecture is capable of reducing the effect of interferences on signal recep-\ntion in the presence or absence of Doppler shifts. The performance enhancement is\nmore significant when the signal to noise and interference ratio is low.\n\n4 Conclusion\n\nThe benefits of SDR in terms of programmability and flexibility are widely known.\nIndeed, SDR-based receivers can change channel number and modulation method\nby just changing the software. The communication band can be changed by tuning\nthe sampling rate of SDR\u2019s A/D converter. SDR can also deal with several different\nbands at the same time. All these changes can be achieved without hardware mod-\nification. The paper has attempted to explore this advantage to build a SDR-based\nground station receiver so that a cluster of pico-satellites can be successfully tracked\nespecially in early orbit phase. In particular, an interference cancellation approach\nis adopted in the SDR to reflect the scenario when the frequency band is occupied\nwith interferences. As a result, users can enjoy a ground station capable of multi\nchannel, multi data rate, flexible architecture, low cost and lower BER.\n\nAcknowledgement The research was supported by the National Space Organization, Taiwan\nunder Grant 95-NSPO(B)-SE-FA09-01(II).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Hardhienata, G. Prabowo, and F. Fitrianingsih\n\nAbstract One of the main priority middle term programs of the Indonesian\ngovernment is to provide food security to the country\u2019s population. Considering\nthe Indonesian geographical condition and its position as a government institution,\nthe Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) decides to\ndevelop a second generation satellite to help the government achieving its food se-\ncurity program goals. This paper describes the mission requirements and analysis\nof Indonesia\u2019s second generation satellite (a remote sensing satellite) to support the\nfood security program.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIndonesia\u2019s geographical condition, namely consisting of thousands of Islands cov-\nering a fast area, is very suitable for adopting satellite technology to help the country\nsolve several of its national goals. Among these goals is to succeed the food secu-\nrity program. Food security is a foundation for a nation\u2019s development; therefore\nit becomes one of the top research priorities for the country\u2019s research institutions.\nBased on the Government National Middle Term Plan (RPJM) 2004\u20132009, the re-\nsearch activities focuses on six priority sectors, namely food security, health care\nand medicine technology, new and renewable energy resource, transportation tech-\nnology and management, information and communication technology, as well as\ndefense and security.\n\nAs a government institution, the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics\nand Space (LAPAN) has the responsibility to support the government in meeting\nits national goals.

Hardhienata et al.\n\nSurveillance Micro satellite in January 2007, LAPAN confidently moves to the next\nstepnamelydevelopingasecondgenerationsatellite (a remotesensingsatellite)whose\nmission direction is to support the national food security program. Its primary objec-\ntive is to monitor the crop and harvest area as well as identify the plant growth phase.\n\n2 Mission Requirements and User Needs\n\nTo fulfill the mission, goal criteria\u2019s has to be described clearly as mission objec-\ntives which describes what the satellites must do in order to achieve its objective.\nThe satellite mission objective can be obtained through the user need\u2019s analysis by\nconsidering its technical limitations. After the mission objectives are defined, the\nnext step is to define the mission requirements and the mission limitations. The\nmission requirements will be applied as a reference in the satellite design.

Dur-\ning the preparation process several government institutions have provided useful\ninputs namely the Agricultural Department, Marine and Fishery Department, and\nthe Forestry Department. A significant input is the information that remote sensing\nsatellite has been applied in Indonesia for a wide range of application ranging from\nagriculture, forestry, marine, disaster mitigation, and others. Table 1 describes the\nuser needs in remote sensing satellite.\n\nIt can be seen from the table that the urgency and economical value of applying\nremote sensing satellite is very high. In the forestry sector, monitoring of fire points\nand fumes, which accounts for the destruction of hectares of forest area in Indonesia,\ncan save the government more than $ 9 Billion, whereas in the Marine and Fishery\n\n\n\nMission Requirements and Analysis of Indonesia\u2019s Second Generation Satellite 303\n\nTable 1 Government department user demand for remote sensing satellite\n\nNo Department Utility Urgency and Economical\nvalue\n\n1.

This state-\nment is not too different than the definition of food security stated in the Indonesian\nLaw No 7 Year 1996, namely a condition where food needs are acquired for every\nhousehold as indicated by the sufficient availability of food, both its quantity and\nquality, safety, prevalent, and affordable.\n\nThe availability of primary food such as rice is an important indicator that de-\nscribes whether food security has been met or not. The government strategy in\nmeeting the food security is based on the availability of five primary food types\nfor the community. To ensure community access on their primary food source ac-\ncurate information and analysis on food demand and availability is necessary if the\ngovernment wants to decide the best strategy. The food availability depends on the\n\n\n\n304 S. Hardhienata et al.\n\nfood production, stock, and import. Meanwhile, the food demand is affected by\nthe amount of population and their consumption rate. After both information are\navailable food security analysis can be formulated to decide the best strategy. This\nprocess is presented in Fig. 2.\n\nThe application of satellite image to support food security in Indonesia has al-\nready been performed, such as the ASTI experimental project between the Agricul-\ntural Department and the Technology Application and Assessments Agency (BPPT)\nto predict rice harvest as well as cooperation between LAPAN and NASDA to apply\nremote sensing satellite from Japan, namely JERS-1, ADEAOS, and ALOS to map\nthe rice crop field, monitor their growth phase, estimate rice harvest, and detect crop\ndiseases.\n\nBesides experimental project, the Agricultural Department has also applied re-\nmote sensing satellite for agricultural field area estimation in national levels, such\nas NOAA, Landsat TM, JERS, and SPOT. However not all of these satellites are\nsuitable for high spatial resolution image remote sensing in the province level crop\narea estimation. In this case, Landsat TM can be applied.\n\nFood Availability\n\u2022 Production \n\u2022 Stock \n\u2022 Import \n\nFood Demand\n\u2022 Population level \n\u2022 Population\n\nconsumption rate \n\nFood Security \nAnalysis \n\nDecision maker \n\nSTRATEGY\n\nFig. 2 Diagram of the food security analysis\n\nPrincipally, all remote sensing devices can be used for crop monitoring. The choice\ndepends on the desired specific application. Hyper spectral image satellites such as\nMODIS and TERRA-ASTER Satellites are optimal to identify the crop condition\nand discrimination, whereas the multi spectral image satellites (medium to high\nresolution) are optimal for crop area estimation, crop growth stage identification,\nand crop productivity. Ideally, hyper spectral image is applied to distinguish the\nfood commodity because the hyper spectral sensor has more canals, thus the sensor\nsensitivity to distinguish color differences is better and therefore easier in detecting\ndifferent food commodity. Less canal sensor requires multiple data if used for crop\nidentification (called multi spectral sensors).\n\nCompared to a conventional satellite, remote sensing satellites have the advan-\ntages in covering local and global areas with periodic and continuous observation,\nproviding objective information, and has independent inputs for field verification,\nwhereas conventional satellites are able provide more accurate information for crop\nidentification. The disadvantages of the remote sensing satellite is the need for\nhigher resolution due to higher accuracy however this statement is used for early\n\n\n\nMission Requirements and Analysis of Indonesia\u2019s Second Generation Satellite 305\n\nestimation and needs further verification. The conventional satellite has the disad-\nvantage that it covers only small areas and thus takes longer time for global analysis.\n\n4 Users Tendency in Remote Sensing Data\n\nAlthough all remote sensing satellite are applicable for crop monitoring, the users\ntend to choose one or two satellite type because more satellite types requires differ-\nent methods thus consumes more time and energy. Many users also prefer medium\nresolution for economical reason because higher resolution satellites are more ex-\npensive than the lower one.\n\nTable 2 provides remote sensing data and the type of information provided by\nthese satellites, whereas Table 3 displays the satellite image price. It can easily be\nseen that better spatial resolution result in an increased cost per square kilometer\n(compare the cost per km2 of IKONOS and SPOT).\n\nThe user needs analyses for the development of LAPAN\u2019s second generation\nsatellite comprises the demanded image resolution, time delivery, and crop data.\nThe image resolution should be good enough to analyze province level images,\nwhich means it is able to provide images with a 1:25,000 to 1:100,000 ratios, thus\nprovides detailed information for each regency. The time data delivery should range\nfrom 14 to 30 days for plant identification (especially rice) whereas the demanded\n\nTable 2 Remote sensing data and type of information\n\nSatellite Spatial Resolution Equivalent with map scale Type of Information\n\nNOAA-AVHRR 1.1 km 1,000,000\u20132,500,000 Diagram\nMODIS 210 m 500,000\u20131,000,000 Exploration\nLandsat TM 30 m 100,000\u2013250,000 Observation\nSPOT 4 10\u201320 m 50,000\u2013100,000 Deep Observation\nSPOT 5 3\u201310 m 25,000\u201350,000 Semi detail\nIKONOS 1\u20134 m 2,500\u201310,000 Detail\n\nSource: Agriculture Department, 1999\n\nTable 3 Satellite Image Price\n\nType of Data Spatial\nResolution\n\nScene size Unit cost Cost per km2\n\nNOAA- AVHRR 1,1 Km 2300 \u00d7 2300km USD 25 Free data\nResours-O 210 m 500 \u00d7 500km \u2013 \u2013\nModis 250 1000 \u00d7 1000km \u2013 \u2013\nLandsat TM 30 m 180 \u00d7 180Km USD 850 USD 0,3/km\nSPOT 10\u201320 m 60 \u00d7 60km 17.000 FFr USD 1,0/km\nRADARSAT 10\u201320 m 40 \u00d7 40km USD. 2000\nIKONOS 1\u20134 m Min 10 \u00d7 10km \u2013 USD 34\u201344/km\n\nSource: Deputy for Remote Sensing LAPAN, 2002\n\n\n\n306 S.

A hyper spectral imager\nsuch as MODIS is more sensitive in detecting different wavelengths, thus can better\ndetect plant stress. The full information regarding a plant condition can be obtained\nby combining hyper and multi spectral images.

This consideration should also match with LAPAN\u2019s satel-\nlite development program phases.\n\nBesides achieving the mission objectives, the program also aims to increase the\nhuman resource capability and independence in satellite technology. To meet both\nobjectives, an optimum point has to be searched. The result is a satellite with a\nweight between 50\u2013300 kg and a performance like those given by Fig. 3.\n\nThe technical constrains can be classified into four points, namely the limita-\ntion of skill and experience, facility, manpower, and micro satellite constrains. The\ndesign of the satellite must be as simple as possible. The spatial resolution value\nof the satellite which consists of 3\u20134 canals will have a range between 10 and 30\nor 3 and 10 m because these resolution are assumed to be sufficient for producing\ndetailed regency level map with a scale between 1:50,000 to 1:100,000. This resolu-\ntion is based on technical consideration, available human resources, demand level,\n\n\n\nMission Requirements and Analysis of Indonesia\u2019s Second Generation Satellite 307\n\nFig. 3 Typical performance of several satellite model based on its weight (SATRECi)\n\nand acceptable. Higher spatial resolution means more complex satellite system. The\ntemporal resolution is between 2 weeks to one month. It is estimated that the satellite\nwill be launched in 2010 using piggy back with a lifetime of about 3 to 5 years.\n\n6 Conclusion\n\nFood security becomes one of the main government programs in Indonesia and\nLAPAN as a government institution has the responsibility to support the success of\nthe program by developing a second generation remote sensing satellite. Its primary\nobjective is to monitor crop and harvest area as well as to identify plant growth phase\nin Indonesia. The satellite\u2019s mission requirements are obtained after considering the\nmission objectives which are obtained after analyzing the user needs, program con-\nsiderations and user needs analysis as well as technical consideration. The technical\nconstrains can be classified into four points, namely the limitation of skill and expe-\nrience, facility, manpower, and micro satellite constrains. In addition, the design of\nthe satellite must be as simple as possible.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Graziani, N. Melega, and P. Tortora\n\nAbstract In the Microsatellite Laboratory of the University of Bologna a project\nwas started in 2003, aimed at the development of a multipurpose microsatellite plat-\nform named ALMASat. The launch into orbit of the first prototype ALMASat-1\nis currently foreseen by the end of 2008. One of the natural applications of the\nmodular ALMASat platform is in the field of space-based Earth observation. At\nthis aim, a spin-off company named ALMASpace was established in 2006, with the\ngoal of designing and demonstrating the feasibility of a low-cost Earth observation\nmission based on the technological achievements obtained by the ALMASat project.\nThis paper summarizes the main characteristics of the ALMASat-1 spacecraft and\ndescribes the current status of the design and development of the ALMASat-EO\n(Earth Observation) spacecraft bus and optical payload whose launch into orbit is\ncurrently scheduled at the end of 2010.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nALMASpace is a new aerospace company, established in 2006 by a group of re-\nsearchers of the II School of Engineering of the University of Bologna. ALMASpace\nrepresents the commercial development of a university project named ALMASat,\nstarted in 2003 in the Microsatellite Laboratory of the University of Bologna and\naimed at the development of a multipurpose microsatellite platform.\n\nThe architecture of the ALMASat satellites has been selected in order to have\na multipurpose bus, to be used with minor changes for several missions, accom-\nmodating payloads with different volume and power requirements.

Graziani et al.\n\nALMASat subsystems are assembled employing commercially-available technolo-\ngies, thus guaranteeing low cost missions and a rapid response. The first microsatel-\nlite ALMASat-1 (Fig. 1) consists of a cubical prism, 300 \u00d7 300 \u00d7 300 mm and\n12 kg, with a modular structure consisting of shop-machined Al trays, and eight\nthreaded bars, providing the necessary stiffness. The satellite is three-axis stabilized\nand makes use of a pitch momentum wheels and three orthogonal magnetic coils for\nattitude control; in addition, silicon-based cold-gas microthrusters will be carried\non board as a technological payload, to be qualified for future missions. The atti-\ntude determination is provided by two (redundant) three-axis magnetometers and\nfour sun sensors. The ADC System is controlled by a software that includes the\ndynamic model and the orbital model of the satellite. The communication system\nworks at three different frequency bands: VHF (uplink) and UHF (downlink) are\nused for telecommands and telemetry while an S-band transmitter is used for higher\ndata-rates in the downlink [1].\n\nFig. 1 ALMASat-1\n\nThe onboard power is provided by both silicon and triple junction solar cells; 48\nseries-connected Si cells are body mounted on each of the four lateral Al/Al honey-\ncomb panels, while 30 series-connected Ga-As cells occupy a fifth panel on top the\nspacecraft. Power storage is guaranteed by three parallel connected battery packs\nmade by four series-connected Li-Ion cells. To evaluate the platform performance,\na possible orbit has been selected, referred to the selected launcher capabilities. The\nestimated orbit characteristics are reported in Table 1.\n\nBased on the orbital characteristics, the power budget for ALMASat-1 was com-\nputed, defining different working configurations depending on the spacecraft orbit\nposition. In particular, a power-saving configuration during the eclipse, and a fully\noperational configuration during the sunlight phase of the orbit were defined. The\ndata obtained by the power budget are reported in Table 2.\n\n\n\nA Low-Cost Microsatellite Platform for Multispectral Earth Observation 311\n\nTable 1 Orbit parameters Orbit parameters Value\n\nSemi-Major axis 7028.17 km\nEccentricity 0\nInclination 98 deg\nArgument of Perigee 0 deg\nR.A.A.N. 165.14 deg\nMean Anomaly 0 deg\nOrbit Period 97.73 min\n\nTable 2 ALMASat-1 Power\nbudget\n\nPower characteristic Value\n\nPeak power produced 19.38 W\nPhotovoltaic system Energy 65322 J\nSolar array power 16.96 W\nEnergy margin 4456.4 J\n\nFig. 2 ALMASat-1 instantaneous power generation and consumption\n\nIn Fig. 2 the instantaneous generated power (blue curve) and power consumption\n(red curve) along the orbit are shown.\n\n2 Mission Target\n\nA low-cost microsatellite Earth Observation mission is constrained by the overall\nspacecraft dimensions and the low-power generated on-board. A possible solution\nis the definition of a limited target represented by a specific portion of the Earth\n\n\n\n312 A. Graziani et al.\n\nsurface. The limited dimensions of the target area reduce the costs per image and\nthe time between the image request and delivery. This is a crucial aspect usually\ntaken by the major image providers.\n\nThe possible cost budget for a small dedicated Earth observation mission is lim-\nited by the annual budget dedicated by regional-size administrations to environmen-\ntal monitoring using traditional instruments, as aerial photogrammetry. Thus, local\ngovernments can be regarded as the typical customer for this kind of missions in\norder to obtain frequently updated images of their territory. For this reason, in the\nmission analysis phase it has been assumed that the mission target is the coverage\nof a limited portion of the Earth surface and, in particular, Italy.\n\n3 Optical Payload\n\nThe development of the optical payload for an Earth observation microsatellite\nmission is always difficult due to the high number of constrains that have to be\nconsidered when dealing with the reduced dimensions and low-power available on\nthe spacecraft. As a matter of fact, most of the widely available systems presently\nused to acquire Earth images, as pushbroom or wiskhbroom scanners, cannot be\nused onboard a microsatellite mainly because of the high power and data rate they\nrequire.\n\nOn the other hand, a common still camera with no moving parts and a discrete\nmode of operation instead of a continuous one (scanner), seems to be the right\nchoice in order to reduce power consumption and complexity of the system; in\nparticular, the main advantage of this system is that the linear sensor is replaced by\na two-dimensional one able to acquire instantaneously an entire scene, thus preserv-\ning the correct geometry and reducing the number of frames necessary to acquire\nthe target area. Moreover, a low frame rate allows the use of a Full Frame CCD\nensuring the highest resolution and a 100% optical fill factor [2].\n\nThe camera has been designed in order to fit the available space dedicated to\nthe payload, onboard the new ALMASat EO (see section 3); as explained below, it\nconsists of an additional cube connected to the main spacecraft, with 300 mm side,\nwhich allows a maximum lens diameter of 200 mm.\n\nThe selected sensor is a monochrome DALSA FTF2020M full frame CCD with\nan active image area of 2048 \u00d7 2048 pixels (4 MPixels) and a spectral resolution of\n12 bit. It has a square pixel structure (12 ?m side), antiblooming and it is capable\nof vertical and horizontal binning in order to obtain an increased sensibility during\nlow-light exposures. To avoid excessive readout noise and high temperatures during\noperations, the sensor will be used in a single output mode with a maximum frame\nrate of 7.5 fps, thus avoiding the use of an active cooling system for the CCD.\n\nTypically, in digital still cameras, multispectral capabilities are achieved by using\nmechanical wheels that rotate optical filters in front of the sensor. To avoid moving\nparts inside the instrument, which could compromise the success of the entire mis-\nsion, a LCD continuous tuneable filter will be placed in-between the sensor and the\noptics, to provide better multispectral capabilities than the mechanical wheel [3].\n\n\n\nA Low-Cost Microsatellite Platform for Multispectral Earth Observation 313\n\nMultispectral images will be generated overlapping single band images and cre-\nating arrays with a maximum of 10 spectral bands. The time the filter takes to switch\nbetween one wavelength to another is typically 50\u2013150 ms depending on the value\nof ?.\n\nCRI has already tested the correct operation of the filter in vacuum conditions;\nit was found that the filter did not experience mechanical damages or deformations\nduring the test and that the optical tuning error is consistent with the one measured\nprior to the test. One of the main issues connected to the use of this kind of filter is\nthe need of custom-designed optics instead of a commercial one; this is due to the\nfilter causing a variation of the B.F.L. (Back Focal Length) which, in turn, results in\na shift of the focus of the system.\n\nThe filter has an aperture of 35 mm, thus matching the dimensions of the CCD\n(main diagonal of 34.76 mm) and the wavelength can be varied between 400 and\n720 nm (in the visible spectrum) with steps of 20 nm.\n\nThe number of bands and the value of the acquired wavelengths can be selected\n(both after launch, and during the whole mission lifetime) by storing appropriate\npalette onboard. This allows a flexible use of the instrument and enables a rapid\nresponse on specific targets, especially during disaster monitoring or for environ-\nmental and agricultural purposes.\n\nFig. 3 Acquisition method, e.g 6 bands image\n\nDiffractive optics have been designed in order to correct the 6 cm shift of the\nfocal plane due to the filter housing, with a fixed focal length of 190 mm; six lenses\nare divided into two main groups and then inserted in a titanium case which will\nprovide the necessary stiffness during the launch phase, and avoid misalignments\nbetween each lens.\n\nThe camera electronics is currently under development and a preliminary layout\nis shown in Fig. 4. The CCD will be controlled by a flexible FPGA that can be\ncustomized to use a variety of different sensors. The filter will be connected to a\nproprietary box linked to the FPGA via RS-232 interface.\n\nThe entire system will be managed by a platform based on an ARM7 micropro-\ncessor able to store images in a commercial flash memory drive and also send data\nvia CAN BUS to the X-band transmitter.\n\nEach image acquired by the sensor is currently in the order of 50 Mbit for a single\nband image, thus the use of an appropriate compression algorithm is necessary. One\nof the most flexible algorithms that can be used on-board to reduce the image dimen-\nsions is the JPEG2000, the new international standard for image data compression\nwhich uses latest compression techniques based on wavelet technology [4].\n\n\n\n314 A. Graziani et al.\n\nLCD Filter CCD FPGA JPEG2000 Hardware\nCompression (ADV212)\n\nARM7\nMicroprocessor\n\nADCS\n\nTX\n\nStorage\n(FLASH memories)\n\nFig. 4 Electronics Layout\n\nFig. 5 Rendered Optics\n\nThe JPEG2000 provides for both lossless or lossy compression in the same archi-\ntecture with different compression ratios. Compression ratios usually vary between\n2:1 in lossless mode to 15:1 in lossy mode with unnoticeable artefacts, allowing\nfurther use of the images for analysis.\n\nThe result is a 50 Mbit image reduced down to 3 Mbit. JPEG2000 also provides\nquality features like region of interest coding (ROI) and different types of progres-\nsive transmission [5].\n\nThe system weighs about 6 kg (including the filter) and is 290 mm long, with a\nmaximum aperture of 155 mm, Fig. 4. The achieved ground resolution is about 40 m\nat 650 km and can be increased utilizing CCDs with different pixel size (26 m with\n7.4 ?m pixel side).\n\n4 ALMASat-EO Bus\n\nThe bus and the main subsystems of the standard ALMASat microsatellite bus will\nbe modified to fulfil the more stringent requirements of the optical payload. At a\n\n\n\nA Low-Cost Microsatellite Platform for Multispectral Earth Observation 315\n\nfirst glance, it is clear that the overall dimensions of the ALMASat bus are not\nlarge enough to carry on-board the camera and the associated electronics. However,\nthe modular structure of the bus allows adding other trays in order to reach the\nrequired dimensions. In particular, the ALMASat structure has been enlarged with\nsix more stacked Al trays, thus doubling the original size, with the \u201cbottom\u201d side of\nthe spacecraft hosting the camera payload.\n\nThe optical payloads needs a higher pointing accuracy in order to obtain good\nEarth-referenced images. The attitude determination and control system will be\nmodified to satisfy this new requirements, by adding two reaction wheels, instead\nof just magnetic coils, to control the yaw and roll angles, so that the new set of\nattitude actuators will be made up by one momentum wheel (on the pitch axis),\ntwo reaction wheels and the three orthogonal magnetic coils. This solution offers\na nominal pointing accuracy in the order of 0.1 degrees, fully compatible with the\nmission needs, as it has been already confirmed by numerical simulations.\n\nFig. 6 Enlarged ALMASat bus and bottom view of the camera payload\n\nAnother enhancement in the ADCS system is the use of microthusters for attitude\ncontrol manoeuvres. During sun eclipse the pointing performance are worse than\nduring the sunlight phase; thus, microthusters have been proposed to be used to\nrapidly reacquire the nominal Earth-pointing mode attitude.\n\nAnother relevant improvement to the standard ALMASat bus will be made in the\ncommunication system architecture. The telemetry and telecommands will still be\nmanaged at VHF and UHF bands, while the payload data (the acquired images) will\nbe transmitted to the ground through a X-band link whose ground and space segment\ncomponents are currently under development. This system will allow data-rates up\nto 1 Mbit/s, thus guaranteeing to transmit to the ground at least one full image per\norbit. The X-band communication system performance has been evaluated by com-\nputing a link budget, whose results are reported in Table 3.\n\nThe Link Budget was computed assuming the satellite with an elevation of 30\ndegrees above the ground station horizon. Due to the limited dimensions of the\nspacecraft, an on-board patch antenna was considered, while a high-gain parabolic\nantenna was hypothesized for the ground station.\n\n\n\n316 A.

In particular, the larger\narea available for the solar panels, offered by the increased size of the spacecraft\nbus, will be entirely covered by triple junction Ga-As cells for a total peak power\nper panel of over 50 W.\n\nBased on the orbital characteristics, assumed similar to those for ALMASat-1, the\npower budget was computed. Also in this case, a power-saving configuration during\nthe eclipse, and a fully operational configuration during the sunlight phase of the orbit\nwere defined. The results obtained from the power budget are reported in Table 4.\n\nIn Fig. 7 the on-board generated power for each panel is reported, printed in dif-\nferent colours, for a single orbit time span. The red curve, in particular, represents\nthe total amount of power produced by the satellite, obtained as the sum of the power\nproduced by each solar panel. The cyan and green curves represent the two lateral\n\nFig. 7 Power generated by each panel\n\n\n\nA Low-Cost Microsatellite Platform for Multispectral Earth Observation 317\n\npanels perpendicular to the sun. The black curve represents a lateral panel illuminated\nthroughout the sunlight phase, while the blue curve represents the top panel.\n\nIn Fig. 8 the instantaneous generated power (blue curve) and power consumption\n(red curve) along the orbit are also shown. For the particular mission goal selected,\nthe target area and the ground station are placed close on to each other; for this\nreason, Fig. 8 shows the corresponding, concurrent, peak power consumption for\nimage acquisition and transmission to the ground.\n\nFig. 8 ALMASat-EO instantaneous power generation and consumption during image acquisitions\n\n5 Conclusions\n\nThis analysis demonstrates the versatility of the original ALMASat bus design that\ncan be reused, with minor changes, also in Earth observation missions.\n\nFurther capabilities of the system, as multi-angle image acquisition, stereo imag-\ning and onboard camera calibration will be investigated in next months to verify its\npossible future implementation. The optical payload, the X-band on-board transmit-\nter and ground segment receiver and the on-board GNSS receiver are currently under\ndevelopment using COTS components, in order to reduce costs and realization time\nwithout affecting the subsystem reliability and lifetime. The expected launch date\nof the first ALMASpace-EO microsatellite is at the end of 2010 and its design and\ndevelopment has been funded by the Italian Ministry of Research (MIUR) for a total\nbudget of ? 900 kEuro.\n\n\n\n318 A.

Hamann, C.J.M. Verhoeven, A.A. Vaartjes, and A.R. Bonnema\n\nAbstract The Delfi program run at Delft University of Technology has the objective\nto provide a means of fast and affordable pre-qualification of new (micro-)techno-\nlogy in space. A second objective is to offer to MSc students the possibility to\ngraduate on real hardware and software development for space missions. The first\nsatellite in this program is Delfi-C3, a 3 kg CubeSat, which flies a new type of\nThin Film Solar Cells, two Autonomous Wireless Sun Sensors and a miniaturized\nUHF-VHF transponder. Next in the series will be a Delfi-C3 successor, on which\na more efficient power subsystem and a high efficiency Advanced Transceiver will\nbe flown. Further missions are considered which will fly micro-technology now\nunder development in the MISAT research program. The paper describes the Delfi-\nC3 mission and satellite with its payload. Emphasis is given to technical solutions\nand the way the project is implemented in the university\u2019s educational program.\nAn overview is given of the current status of the project and plans for the future\ndevelopment of Delfi missions are outlined.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nDelfi-C3 [1] is the first in a series of nano-satellites of the Delft University of Tech-\nnology.

Hamann et al.\n\nAerospace Engineering and of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer\nScience. It will act as a technology test-bed for three payloads: Thin Film Solar\nCells (TFSC), an Autonomous Wireless Sun Sensor (AWSS) and a radio-amateur,\nnano-satellite-based UHF/VHF linear transponder.\n\nThe project was initiated in November 2004. Based on a three-unit CubeSat,\nDelfi-C3 will be launched from a standard CubeSat deployer such as the X-POD.\nDelfi-C3 will make use of the amateur radio frequency bands for its telemetry down-\nlink and tele-command uplink. Software will be made available to participating ama-\nteur radio operators, which will allow them to decode, display and send the telemetry\nto the central ground station in Delft. The satellite will not include an active attitude\ncontrol system. A passive rotation rate damping will be used to limit its rotation rate.\nFurthermore, as the primary payloads do not require operations in eclipse a battery\nhas been avoided, which simplifies the spacecraft design. A piggyback launch in\nSeptember 2007 has been arranged on a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV)\nfrom India. It will be injected in a circular 98? inclination Sun-synchronous orbit\nat 630 km altitude. After launch and deployment, three months of gathering payload\ndata is foreseen, after which the satellite will be switched into linear transponder\nmode. Figure 1 shows an exploded view of the Delfi-C3 satellite.\n\nFig. 1 Delfi-C3 satellite (exploded view)\n\nAt the date of writing Delfi-C3 subsystems have been produced and are under test.\nSystem integration has started and functional and environmental tests are scheduled\nfor completion before July 2007.\n\n2 Technology Payloads\n\nThe TFSC (Fig. 2) payload is based on the latest development in the area of pho-\ntovoltaic cells by the company Dutch Space. The cells consist of a Copper Indium\nGallium diSelenide (CIGS) photovoltaic layer, which is deposited by evaporation\n\n\n\nNano-Satellites for Micro-Technology Pre-Qualification 321\n\non a titanium base layer of 25 micrometers. The cells will be integrated tile-wise,\nensuring a minimal loss of active cell area. The aim of this new type of solar cell\nis to create a lightweight and low-cost product for future space applications. The\ntarget is a 50% cost reduction of solar arrays, while improving the power to mass\nperformance with 50% compared to conventional solar cells. The efficiency will be\nmore than 12%. Measuring the characteristic current-voltage curves and cell tem-\nperature under varying Sun input will test the performance of the TFSC payload.\nAs the temperature of the thin foil cannot be measured directly, it will be measured\nby determining the electrical resistance of a dummy titanium cell mounted close to\nthe actual TFSC\u2019s. The TFSC\u2019s cannot be body mounted because of their fragility,\nbut also because of the high cell temperatures that would result from such a con-\nfiguration. For this reason the four pairs of TFSC\u2019s are mounted at the tip of each\ndeployable solar panel.\n\nFig. 2 TFSC payload\n\nThe AWSS (Fig. 3) is a development of TNO in the Netherlands [2] and is placed\nat the top and bottom of Delfi-C3. The sensors will have a half-sized GaAs solar cell\nas their own power supply, making them independent of the satellite\u2019s electrical\npower system. This autonomy is accompanied by a wireless radio frequency link,\nusing an adapted commercial off-the-shelf transceiver.\n\nThe UHF/VHF transponder, which doubles as a transceiver in science mode, is of\nconventional design. It is however, for the first time that such a transponder, allowing\nfive simultaneous users, will fly on a CubeSat.\n\nTelemetry, both science and housekeeping data, is broadcasted continuously and\nmay be received with a standard radio-amateur ground station. The satellite is\n\n\n\n322 R.J. Hamann et al.\n\nFig. 3 AWSS payload\n\noperated from the main ground station at the Delft University of Technology, and\nhas a total of 25 minutes ground contact time in three passes per 24 hours.\n\nTo increase the amount of data received, a distributed ground network has been\ncreated composed of radio-amateurs worldwide. By means of software made avail-\nable to them by the Delfi-C3 project they will be able to receive and decode the\ntelemetry and to send the raw and decoded data to the operations center in Delft,\nwhere they are processed and made available to the users Dutch Space, TNO and,\nof course, the Delfi-C3 project itself.\n\n3 Technical Constraints\n\nMost important constraints for a nano-satellite are size, power and mass. The size\nlimitation drives towards the application of surface mounted devices (SMD\u2019s) wher-\never possible and requires the implementation of deployment mechanisms for e.g.\nthe eight antennae, which have in this case a maximum length of 0.5 m, which\nshould be accommodated in an envelope with a maximum length of 0.3 m. So a\ndedicated design using a tape spring (measurement tape) that allows to store each\nantenna in a volume of 10 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 50 mm has been developed (see Fig. 4).\n\nThe Delfi-C3 architecture originally has been designed as a star architecture with\none, single central computer. However, this led to a system bus of more than 120\nwires running from top to bottom through the satellite, consuming 18% of the to-\ntal mass budget. The transition to a decentralized Command and Data Handling\nSubsystem (CDHS), where each print is controlled by a dedicated microcontroller\nresulted in a mass saving of 11% (star architecture: 0.530 kg, 18% of total; decen-\ntralized architecture: 0.214 kg, 7% of total).\n\nThe transmitter uses most of the power (2 out of 3 Watts available). It then\nbecame obvious that conventional over-current protection (OCP) of the individual\nprints and subsystems would consume too large a part of the remaining power to\nallow satisfactory satellite operations. The solution was the introduction of a de-\ncentralized Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS), where a separate controller is used\nto protect and switch each print or subsystem. That way a power saving (exclud-\n\n\n\nNano-Satellites for Micro-Technology Pre-Qualification 323\n\nFig. 4 Modular antenna box (MAB)\n\ning transmitter power) of 11% was achieved (conventional switch and OCP design:\n0.182 Watt, 18% of total; decentralized \u201cswitching\u201d micro-controllers: 0.073 Watt,\n7% of total). The resulting architecture using no less than 18 micro-controllers is\nshown in Fig. 5.\n\n4 Project Implementation in the Educational Program\n\nThe project team currently comprises about 25 students, who are in their last year\nof studies; half of them are in Aerospace Engineering, and half in Electrical and\nComputer Engineering. Although the project originally has been started with MSc\nstudents only, there is currently about equal participation of MSc and BEng students.\nIt is felt that this is an ideal team composition in the later phases of the project. The\nwork the students do on Delfi-C3 is part of their final thesis work. Six staff members\nare involved in the project for in average 50% of their time.\n\nA \u201cself-managed\u201d student team has run the first year the project. As the students\nwere very committed to building this first Dutch university satellite, this has worked\nvery well. Also the fact that two well-known space companies are customers for\nthe project was very stimulating and offered great learning opportunities for the stu-\ndents involved. However, the transition from a paper study to more serious hardware\nbread-boarding has been made too late and appeared to require more guidance by\nstaff, in particular by staff with industrial experience. Student tasks need then to be\nspecified more accurately, and achieving timely technology readiness and maintain-\ning the schedule must get priority over the \u201clearning by making mistakes\u201d, which is\nthe normal operating mode in a student run project.\n\nThis certainly is the case, when a commitment for a launch date has been made.\nIn this phase students have to execute the tasks that are most urgent, even if they are\nnormally considered to be too \u201cmenial\u201d for MSc or BEng level graduation work or\n\n\n\n324 R.J.

Good relations with established electronic and\nspace industries are essential to achieve the technical project goals, and, for certain\ntasks, a direct use of their facilities and expertise should be made.\n\nFinally, the use of Delfi-C3 for educational purposes is not limited to the higher\neducation institutions directly involved in the project. Thanks to the mission archi-\ntecture selected it is very well possible to equip secondary schools with a relatively\nsimple and cheap ground station (kit), that allows the students to e.g. receive the\nsatellite data, to make these visible and execute ground-based reference experi-\nments, to carry out satellite ranging experiments and to explore the fundamentals\nof orbital mechanics. Activities in this sense have been started and help to rise the\ninterest in engineering sciences with the younger generation.\n\n5 Current Project Status\n\nDelfi-C3 is currently in the test and verification phase. Subsystem testing has been\ncompleted for the most part and integration testing has also started.\n\nSubsystem testing began in January 2007 with the Combination Board (ComBo).\nThe ComBo is the interface of the FM430 On-Board Computer (OBC) board with\nthe rest of the satellite and it houses the AWSS receiver. Problems discovered re-\nquired repairs, which rendered the first ComBo as \u201cnon-flight\u201d. A second ComBo\nhas been tested and will be flight hardware. The two InterConnect Boards (ICB\u2019s)\nhouse the antennae and its microcontrollers manage the deployable mechanisms:\ntwo solar panels and four antennae. Tact switches monitor the deployment status\nand a simulation board was made to simulate the mechanisms during functional\ntesting (Fig. 6). For the moment, simulated deploy times have been used to test the\nfunctionality. Actual deployment times will be implemented following the deploy-\nment tests.\n\nThe two Measurement Boards (MeBo\u2019s) perform the measurements of TFSC\npayload. Initial problems with the circuits have been resolved and the board is now\nbeing functionally tested. Tests involving the Voltage Controlled Oscillator, which\nwill be used as a back-up in case of OBC failure, are scheduled to be conducted\nanytime now.\n\nVersion 2.0 of the OBC software is almost completed and OBC \u2013 subsystem\ninterface testing is underway.\n\nDesign and development of the Radio Amateur Platform (RAP) proved to be\nquite an effort, but an elegant breadboard of the RAP has been completed and the\nflight PCB is expected to come in soon.\n\nGround support equipment for the assembly, integration and test phase is being\nbuild. A stack dummy, for fit-checking subsystem boards, and the integration jig\n\n\n\n326 R.J. Hamann et al.\n\nFig. 6 ICB test setup\n\nFig. 7 Delfi-C3 chassis with top and bottom panel in integration and test jig\n\nhave just been completed. Figure 7 shows the integration jig that will also support\nthe satellite during thermal-vacuum testing.\n\nAt this moment work is focused on the ground system. The first version of the\ntelemetry decoding software has been produced and tested. Work on the science\nand housekeeping data post-processing system is progressing well. The User and\nSoftware Requirement Documents are being compiled and architectural and detailed\ndesign and coding will be started next month. The Delfi ground station has been used\nalready for several other missions (e.g. SSETI Express) and is being upgraded to full\nredundancy (one of the lessons learned of that mission).\n\n\n\nNano-Satellites for Micro-Technology Pre-Qualification 327\n\nMuch has been learned from the test and verification phase so far. Originally the\nidea was to have a \u201cproto-flight\u201d approach, but the problems encountered during\nthe first subsystem tests of the Combination Board in January quickly proved that\nwas not feasible, even for a small project like Delfi-C3. The test and verification\nphase was for Delfi-C3 the first moment during the project in which the design\nwas properly confronted with real life practice and it became clear that (elegant)\nbreadboards should have been built earlier in the project, if short development times\nof about two years are targeted for. Getting concept and ideas out in practice could\nhave reduced the number of problems that were encountered during the beginning\nof the test and verification phase considerably. This is something that definitely will\nhave to be done in the projects that follow.\n\nAnother example of the failure of the proto-flight approach is the fact that the\nModular Antenna Boxes had to go through five design and test cycles before a satis-\nfactory performance was achieved. For more details on the verification program of\nDelfi-C3 see [3].\n\n6 Delfi-C333 FOLLOW-ON Mission\n\nThe spare of the Delfi-C3 satellite possibly will be used for a follow-on mission.\nModifications for this mission will be made in the Electrical Power Subsystem and\nthe Communication Subsystem.\n\nThe DelfiC3 satellite has, like many other satellites, different operation modes\nthat require different ways of signal coding and transmission. A specific transceiver\noptimal for one of the operation modes may be suboptimal for another mode. As\nCubeSats are too small to carry separate optimal transceivers for each mode, an ele-\ngant solution to this problem is the reconfigurable transceiver. In such a transceiver\nthe OBC takes many decisions during the mission that are normally taken in design\nphase by the designer and remain fixed during the rest of the operational life. This\nmeans that, for example, the architecture of the transceiver is not fixed, but \u201cde-\nsigned and implemented\u201d by the OBC based on the specific transmission needs, like\ndata rate, modulation scheme and the environmental circumstances like available\npower and quality of the transmission path. Since it is possible to implement most of\nthe transceiver as a system-in-a-package (SIP), which is a micro-electronic system\nconsisting of several integrated circuits (IC\u2019s) bonded together and put into a single\nIC-package, the volume and mass penalty for having such an Advanced Transceiver\n(ATRX) onboard is negligible. The power consumption is never more than exactly\nneeded to offer the required quality of service, since the OBC can always implement\nthe optimal transceiver architecture.\n\nDelfi-C3 has transmission modes in which the amplitude of the transmitted sig-\nnal carries information and modes in which the information is contained in phase or\nfrequency of the signal only. A first step into the direction of a fully reconfigurable\ntransceiver is the design and implementation of a reconfigurable power amplifier (PA).\nDue to the limitedonboard resources, theefficiencyof thePAisofextremeimportance.\nThe antennae should transmit the maximum power available in the satellite.\n\n\n\n328 R.J. Hamann et al.\n\nThe core of the PA in the ATRX is a switching amplifier. The power from the\nsolar panels is put directly to the antennas via high efficiency switches that can\nmodulate the phase and the frequency of the transmitted power. This is a very high\nefficiency mode with efficiencies (theoretically) much better than 90%, but unfor-\ntunately without the possibility for amplitude modulation. In this mode the PA can\nonly be used to transmit frequency/phase modulated telemetry data. In transponder\nmode, also amplitude modulation must be possible. To achieve this, a high efficiency\nDC/DC converter modulates the power from the solar panels with the information.\nThis amplitude modulated power supply is then fed to the switching PA that puts it\nto the antennas at the right carrier frequency and that can add frequency or phase\nmodulation if required.\n\nWhen a very high linearity is required, negative feedback will be applied to the\nPA-DC/DC converter system. Negative feedback is the most powerful means to\nlinearize a system. Normally the stability of the feedback loop around a complex\namplifier system might be questionable, but in the (also electrically) small and well-\ndefined SIP-module, stability can be guaranteed.\n\nFigure 8 shows a diagram of the PA system of the ATRX. The mode-selection\nswitches are used by the OBC to put the PA in the optimal mode for a specific trans-\nmission, varying from highly linear with still a very good efficiency to maximum\npower output without amplitude modulation at an extremely high efficiency.\n\nClass E/F PA\n\nDC/DC\n\nDetectorDetector\n\nSource Load\n\nSupply\n\nS2\n\nS1\n\nAM Input\n\nS3\n\nFig. 8 Power amplifier system of ATRX\n\nIn this follow-on mission also a more advanced (maximum power point tracking)\nEPS will be flown, where the excess power will be used to maximize the transceiver\nperformance. Actual realization of this mission depends on the success of the Delfi-\nC3 launch and operations and on the success of identifying candidate technologies\nfrom the MISAT program (see section 7) for a 2009 mission.\n\n7 MISAT Derived Missions\n\nWithin the MISAT program [4], see Fig. 9, a number of micro-technologies are\ndeveloped which are potential candidates for next Delfi missions. The AWSS is\n\n\n\nNano-Satellites for Micro-Technology Pre-Qualification 329\n\nalready a pre-development of the Micro Sun Sensor, and the RF Front End and\nSmart Power technology will be incorporated in the Delfi-C3 follow-on mission.\n\nFor a next mission micro-propulsion and Micro Navigation System components\nmay for example be combined in a simple formation-flying mission. Another possi-\nbility is to develop a nano-satellite attitude control system based on a micro-inertial\nplatform. In the second half of 2007 a project will be started to identify candidate\ntechnologies for this third Delfi nano-satellite. Actual choice will depend the avail-\nability of flight-ready prototype technology end of 2009.\n\nMISAT Cluster \n\nSpacecraft Bus Spacecraft Payload DistributedSystems\n\nAuton.

Klimov, V.G. Rodin, L.M. Zelenyi, and V.N. Angarov\n\nAbstract The development of the method of the creation of micro-satellite (?50 kg)\nplatforms for the fundamental and applied research of the Earth and near-earth outer\nspace is complex problem both the scientific and technical plan, connected with\ndevelopment and use of contemporary spacecraft (SC) and with the scientific meth-\nods problems of conducting basic space research. All these problems are logically\nconnected with the hierarchy of preparation and realization on board SC of experi-\nments. At present in space physics and astrophysics is accumulated the significant\nobservant material, obtained by SC. Great successes are achieved in the theoretical\nstudies of near-earth space, atmosphere and lithosphere of the Earth. There are se-\nrious studies of laboratory and computer simulation. Examination from the united\npositions of entire complex of preparation and conducting of basic space research\nleads to the need of the association of the efforts of scientists and engineers, who\ncarry out the study of each of the directions enumerated above.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nIn the last decade because of the reduction of financing the entire space industry,\npresence of the conversion launch systems, qualitatively new achievements of micro-\nelectronics and micromechanics, accessibility of the elements of the space systems\n\nS.I.

Klimov et al.\n\nmuch attention began to be given to the use of small spacecrafts: micro-satellite \u2013 MS\n(100\u201310 kg); nano-satellite \u2013 NS (10th kg) for conducting of scientific and applied\nresearch.\n\nThe analysis of the launching of small SC (mass to 300 kg), carry out in the\nperiod from 1986 through 2000, shows that this segment of space activity intensively\ncommercialization. In Table 1 [2] is shown the distribution of the number launched\nsmall SC the categories: military, civil (budgetary), commercial.\n\nThe comparison of the periods of 1986\u20131990 and 1996\u20132000 demonstrates the\nclearly expressed tendency: a considerable increase in the portion of the starting\nof civil (2,5 times) and especially commercial (from 1% to 38%) SC occurred\ndue to the sharp (four times) reduction of the share of the starting SC of military\ndesignation.\n\nHow this tendency it can influence conducting basic and applied space research?\nAt present in space physics and astrophysics is accumulated the significant ob-\n\nservant material, obtained by SC. Great successes are achieved in the theoreti-\ncal studies of near-earth space, atmosphere and lithosphere of the Earth. There\nare serious studies of laboratory and computer simulation. Examination from the\nunited positions of entire complex of preparation and conducting of basic space\nresearch leads to the need of the association of the efforts of scientists, who carry\nout the study of each of the directions enumerated above. In this case it is neces-\nsary to carry out an integral approach to the solution of the problems presented by\nthe way:\n\n? the development of the methods of introducing the contemporary technological-\ndesign solutions in the process of creating of constructions and systems of micro-\nsatellite platforms with the use of achievements of physical instrument manufac-\nture, microelectronics and micromechanics;\n\n? the development of the new methods of experimental studies of the Earth and\nnear-earth outer space for their realization on contemporary highly effective SC;\n\n? theoretical analysis method control onboard system micro- and nano- space plat-\nform with use achievement microelectronics and micromechanics for purposes\nguarantee high demand on their orientation and stabilization;\n\n? conducting the laboratory and numerical simulation of control processes by on-\nboard systems of micro-platform for the purpose of the determination of the\ncritical elements of models.\n\nPromising trends in development of experimental physics require of ever more\nprecise and more highly informative scientific instruments. Moreover, situation is\ncomplicated by a constant reduction of financing scientific studies, even in the de-\nveloped countries. This specifies the need for development and creating the new\ngeneration of scientific instruments with the light weight and the required power,\nthe high level of the metrological parameters.\n\nSince 2004 in the Space Research Institute of RAS is conducted the work on\nthe theme \u201cCreation of the onboard platform of the micro-satellite of applied and\nscientific designation on the basis of contemporary technologies and developments\u201d,\n\n\n\nDevelopment of the Method of the Creation of Micro-Satellite (?50 kg) Platforms 335\n\nincluded in the program of basic research of Presidium RAS \u201cChanges in the envi-\nronment and climate: natural catastrophes\u201d.\n\nFig. 1 Spectrum of electromagnetic radiation\n\nAt present micro-satellite sufficiently widely are used in the practice, including\nfor warning and liquidation of extraordinary situations. In this case in practice is\nused the relatively narrow range of the electromagnetic radiations of the visible\nregion \u2013 visible light (Fig. 1). Using a large experience of basic space research, SRI\nRAS in last 2 years studies the scientific programs with the use of micro-satellite,\noriented to the study of infrared, ultraviolet \u2013 UV and X -ray ranges not only for\nbasic space research, but also oriented to the tasks the study of some aspects of\nextraordinary situations.\n\nThe long-wave electromagnetic radiations (in Fig. 1 they must be represented on\nthe left side of lower than the radio-frequency band overlap three orders in the fre-\nquency, from the portions MHz to first Hz), utilized for studies of plasma processes\nin space, they have the same value as seismic waves for studying the structure of\nthe Earth. In comparison with the electromagnetic processes in other regions of\nphysics, wave in the plasma they possess a number of specific special features. The\nfundamental value the resonance effects have from these special features: interaction\nof waves and particles, the transformation of waves, the formation of resonators\nand waveguides. Because of resonance effects, ULF-wave they transfer information\nabout the dynamic phenomena in the near-earth space and the upper atmosphere,\nand they reach the amplitudes, sufficient in order to have an active effect on the flow\nof plasma processes and to effectively accelerate magnetosphere electrons. They\ndetermine some parameters of space weather thus. ULF disturbance accompany all\ngeophysical phenomena, connected with the large release of energy \u2013 the magnetic\nstorms, explosions, hurricanes and thunderstorms, earthquakes, and they are one\nof the basic agents, which connect in these periods different geophysical shells.\nRecorded by satellite and ground-based magnetometers ULF pulsations of the ter-\nrestrial magnetic field are the reflection of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in\nthe near-earth medium.\n\n\n\n336 S.I. Klimov et al.\n\n2 Micro-Satellite Platform for Monitoring Greenhouse Gases\n(CO222) and Catastrophic Phenomena on the Surface,\nin Atmosphere and Ionosphere of the Earth\n\nAtmospheric carbonic acid, as basic greenhouse gas, plays the most important role\nin the climate of the Earth, absorbing the thermal radiation of the earth\u2019s surface, and\npreventing its emission into the space. Circulation CO2 and generally carbon in the\natmosphere, the ocean and the biosphere to the high degree is checked by natural\nfactors, but it is known in also the time that 30% an increase of the concentration\nof this gas in the atmosphere occurred in the last 100 years [4]. The possible climatic\nconsequences of this process are intensively studied by the leading scientific centers of\nentire peace and serve as the object of serious political discussions. In the last 40 years\nof the observations, which are led with the aid of the ground-based network, they show\nthat only about half of the anthropogenic CO2 remains in the atmosphere. Another\nhalf is absorbed by ocean and continental ecosystems. However, the measurements\nexisting today ensure neither the necessary scope nor permission, necessary for the\nidentification of drains CO2. In particular, there are serious indications of the powerful\ndrain CO2 in the northern hemisphere, but it is not possible to divide the contributions\nof North American and Asian continents and oceans. For the verification of numerical\nmodels and forecasts comprised on their basis, for the evaluation of the role of different\nprocessesand reservoirs in thebalanceofcarbondioxide theverypreciseand localized\nmeasurements of its concentration in the atmosphere are necessary. Is well known the\npolitical aspect of this problem.\n\nAt the present moment in the world there are no satellites, which make it possible\nto solve this problem both globally, and it is regional [5]. Measurements with high\nspectral resolution in the broad spectral band in combination with the theoretical\nexamination of the processes of the transfer of harmful substances will make it\npossible to make a serious contribution to the solution of this problem. Monitor-\ning of low component and harmful impurities in the atmosphere is another most\nimportant task. Measurements by the method of solar radioscopy will make it pos-\nsible to obtain the data about the scattered pollution due to the high sensitivity of\nequipment.\n\nComparatively recently appeared the new and extremely interesting data about\nthe distribution in the atmosphere of the Earth of the greenhouse gases, connected\nwith the processes in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and on the Earth\u2019s surface. It was\nshown that methane CH4 is one of the most important greenhouse gases of the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere, in the essential measure, which determines radiation balance\nand the climate of planet. The effectiveness of absorption by methane of the ther-\nmal radiation of the earth\u2019s surface is 60 times higher than in CO2. Ejections CH4\ninto the atmosphere, according to the estimations of the reaching at present 500\nmegatons per year, and observing increase in its atmospheric content, can lead to a\nconsiderable increase in its temperature in the next decades. In this case the process\nof increasing the temperature is increasing, since its increase strengthens the iso-\nlation of methane into the atmosphere due to the melting of soils in the regions of\npermafrost.\n\n\n\nDevelopment of the Method of the Creation of Micro-Satellite (?50 kg) Platforms 337\n\nThus, the role of methane (concentration of which was doubled in comparison\nwith the preindustrial period and it continues grow in connection with the tendencies\nof the warming up of climate) in the course of time grows and approaches a role of\nthe strongest greenhouse gas \u2013 CO2.\n\nIn the process of works according to the Program of basic research of the Presidium\nRAS \u201cChanges in the environment and climate: natural catastrophes\u201d we showed that\nmeasurements of reflected and scattered solar radiation in the UV- the neighbor IR\nranges give the possibility of the remote sensing of basic greenhouse gases, such as\nCO2 and CH4, and also numerous atmospheric admixtures. In the case of catastrophic\nphenomena this method makes it possible to judge the course of the process, proceed-\ning in the center of event, from the sufficiently large distances.\n\nMeasurements on the spacecraft make it possible to conduct the global moni-\ntoring of the distribution of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere of the Earth and\nplasma- wave effects in atmosphere and ionosphere of the Earth, that influence both\nthe environment and the person himself and the different spheres of his activity.\n\nAre most promising the spectroscopic observations in the neighbor IR range,\nwhich make it possible to conduct the precise measurements of the complete content\nCO2 in the atmosphere with satisfaction of two conditions: high spectral resolution,\nwhich makes it possible to distinguish the separate unsaturated spectral lines in the\nweak strips CO2 and a good knowledge of the optical path, which passes entire\nthickness of the atmosphere. Small overall sizes and mass of equipment play im-\nportant role. The preparation of the compact spectrometer of high resolution for\nthe Project Venus Express (14) makes it possible to propose for the micro-satellite\n\u201cChibis\u201d the practically finished development of spectrometer ORACUL with re-\nsolving power of ?/?? ? 20000 in the range 1.58 mkm. In the instrument the\ndiffraction grating of the echelle grating, which works in the high orders of diffrac-\ntion, is used.\n\nUsing, first of all, the experience, obtained in the implementation of projects\n\u201cVenus- Halley\u201d, \u201cPhobos\u201d and \u201cInterball\u201d on the technical tasks of the SRI RAS\nwere carry out serious studies in the field of development and creating the sensors of\nthe electromagnetic parameters of space plasma \u2013 the AC and DC magnetometers,\nthe gauges of the tension of electric field and density of three-dimensional current.\nFor the ferro-probe magnetometers (FZM) reduction in the weight and required\npower was achieved not only method of using the new electronic components, but\nalso by development of new measurement procedure. Scientific and technological\nstudies made it possible to reduce the internally-produced noise FZM, and now typ-\nical noise level our FZM it is about 10 pico-Tesla at the frequency of 1 Hz, and\nrecord value \u2013 is below 1 pico-Tesla.\n\nAs a result of prolonged studies the original super-lightweight version of induc-\ntion magnetometers was created (IM).

The lightened\nmodel of electric probe for measuring the tension of electric field is created. Is de-\nveloped new instrument \u2013 wave probe, which unites three sensors in one housing:\nthe split Langmuir probe, IM and the gauge of electric potential. Its effectiveness is\n\n\n\n338 S.I. Klimov et al.\n\nconfirmed by both the theoretical studies and by results of simulation experiments\nin the plasma camber. These instruments underwent flight tests on board the satellite\n\u201cSich-1M\u201d [15].\n\n3 Study of the New Physical Mechanisms of the Electrical\nDischarges in the Atmosphere\n\nA number of the physical phenomena in the atmosphere, which fundamentally\nchanged our idea about the lightning discharges, are discovered in recent years.\n\n1. In the observations from automatic spacecraft COMPTON and RHESSI are dis-\ncovered the exceptionally powerful pulses of the gamma emission, which go\nfrom the Earth. Energy of pulses reaches tens of kJ, i.e., to 1017\u20131018 of radiation\nquanta with the energy 100 keV and above [18]. At present these phenomena in\ndetail are investigated. It is experimentally proven that these pulses it is generated\nduring 2\u20133 ms before the basic lightning discharge. COMPTON and RHESSI\nthey were not intended especially for thunderstorm studies. Therefore, the mea-\nsurements carried out on them do not bear complex nature and do not possess a\nsufficient time resolution.\n\n2. Is discovered the generation of the short (?1 s) single radio bursts, which lead to\nthe emission of the radio-frequency pulses of the super high power (to 100 GW\nand above) [6]. Pulses are generated in the thunderstorm clouds at the large\nheights of 13\u201320 km such pulses create the radio emission in the very wide\nfrequency band, observed at the distances to several 1000 km.\n\n3. In the ground observations are discovered the flashes of the gamma emission,\nassociated with the jumps of electric field, characteristic for the propagation of\nthe stepped leader of lightning]. Gamma emission covers the area of 0.3\u20130.5\nsquare kilometers, and possibly also more.\n\nAt the basis of the observed phenomena lies the theoretically forecast in the FIAN\nnew physical phenomenon, which was called breakdown on the running away elec-\ntrons [1]. The electrons of relativistic energies play the determining role in this pro-\ncess. The avalanche of the running away electrons being been born in the course of\nthe development of breakdown serves as the source of gamma emission. The spe-\ncial feature of this form of breakdown is the fact that it occurs in the low electric\nfields, but it requires for its initiation of the seeding particles of the high energy. The\nextremely large number of electrons of low energies simultaneously is born. The\nmotion of these electrons in the electric field of thunderstorm gives birth to the pow-\nerful pulse of radio emission. Fundamental role in the development of breakdown\non the running away electrons play the cosmic rays of high energies. Extensive\nair shower contains a large quantity of high-energy electrons, which serve as the\nrequired priming of breakdown. The development of extensive air shower with the\nparticles of high energies at high altitudes occurs only if it is move at the angle,\nclose to the horizon. In this case occurs strengthening breakdown on the running\n\n\n\nDevelopment of the Method of the Creation of Micro-Satellite (?50 kg) Platforms 339\n\naway electrons and notable increase in its three-dimensional scale. For this very\nreason, according to theory, discharges at high altitudes bear so powerful a nature\nboth in the radio and in the gamma emission.\n\nThe practical importance of the proposed studies is determined by the following\ncircumstances.\n\n1. Super-power gamma emission at the heights of 10\u201320 km is of significant interest\nfrom the point of view of safety of both the passengers and the aircraft of civil\nand military aviation.\n\n2. Large areas, covered with intensive gamma emission on the Earth, can prove to\nbe important both from the point of view of ecology and from the point of view\nof safety of people.\n\n3. Super-power single radio-frequency pulses have powerful emission in practice\nin entire working range of the radio waves (to 3 GHz and above). They can serve\nas convenient natural radiation source for creating the global monitoring of radio\ncommunication.\n\n4 Micro-Satellite Platform \u201cCHIBIS\u201d\n\n4.1 Development of the Methods of Introducing the Contemporary\nTechnological-Design Solutions in the Process of Creating\nof Constructions and Systems MP\n\nIn the last decade because of the reduction of financing the entire space industry,\npresence of the conversion starting systems, enormous achievements of microelec-\ntronics, accessibility of the elements of the space systems much attention began to\nbe given to the use of small automatic spacecraft (micros-satellite) for conducting\nof scientific studies. In particular, SRI RAS in the cooperation with the Russian\npartners from the space industry was developed and with the support of the RSC\n\u201cENERGIA\u201d was injected into orbit during March 2002 the micro-satellite \u201cKolibri-\n2000\u201d [11]. The injection of the micro-satellite \u201cKolibri-2000\u201d into orbit, close to\nthe orbit of the ISS, is realized on 20 March, 2002, by separation from ship the\n\u201cProgress M1-7\u201d, redockted before this from ISS. Study program by \u201cKolibri-2000\u201d\nincluded the following tasks: monitoring strong technogenic by action in the iono-\nsphere; a study of ionosphere disturbances with the development of the magnetic\nstorms in the terrestrial magnetosphere [12].\n\nAll systems and scientific instruments of the MS (mass in the equipped state \u2013\n20.5 kg, energy consumption 30 W) without the failures worked in entire period of\nits ballistic existence.\n\nThe basis of the technological-design solution of the \u201cKolibri-2000\u201d was the\nthorough study of layout MS, on the basis of the main requirement, presented to\nthe project, need for separation from that unjointed from the ISS, after the execution\nby cargo transport ship (CTS) \u201cProgress\u201d it of basic task,. This led to the need of\n\n\n\n340 S.I. Klimov et al.\n\nFig. 2 Diagram of the separation (\u201claunch\u201d) of the microsatellite from TSC\n\nusing the specialized starter. Task was solved by developing the transport-starting\ncontainer (TSC), intended also for the fixation MS inside the TSC during the in-\njection the CTS into orbit and the jointing with the ISS. For the realization of the\n\u201cstarting\u201d of the \u201cKolibri-2000\u201d, the TSC were established by cosmonauts on the\nCTS \u201cupper lid\u201d, find even in docked configuration with the Service module (SM),\ni.e., inside the ISS.\n\nFig. 3 Total view of microsatellite \u201cChibis\u201d\n\n\n\nDevelopment of the Method of the Creation of Micro-Satellite (?50 kg) Platforms 341\n\nIn the course of creating the \u201cacademic\u201d microsatellite \u201cChibis\u201d, in which partici-\npate and acquire real experience young specialists, is used the contemporary concept\nof the \u201cflying instrument\u201d, which optimally combines the requirements of scientific\ninstruments and micro-satellite platform. This makes it possible to conduct scientific\nspace studies in Russia without the attraction of the expensive automatic spacecraft,\ndeveloped by enterprises in the space field.\n\nThe development of the complex of scientific instruments proposed within the\nframework of project practically does not have an analog. For the first time is de-\nveloped the complex of measuring equipment, oriented to the study of the light-\nning discharges, which entire overlapping practically spectrum of electromagnetic\nradiations and precisely under this task is created the design of small automatic\nspacecraft, its systems of the collection of information and support systems.\n\nFor the realization of the above-indicated projects, drawing on experience of de-\nvelopment and use of a micro-satellite \u201cKolibri-2000\u201d, is carry out the development\nof micro-satellite \u201cChibis\u201d [19].\n\nMain technical characteristics of the micro-satellite \u201cChibis\u201d.\n\n?

Among them, Formosat-2 launched in May 2004 with\nmission life of five years has performed an outstanding job in the field of disas-\nter monitoring especially. Stepping into the second-stage long-term plan for the\nTaiwanese space development, the top priority for National Space Organization\n(NSPO) is to have an indigenous satellite on orbit. With the indigenous satellite on\norbit in mind and appreciation of Formosat-2 performance, it is certainly essential\nfor NSPO to launch another earth observation satellite as our next mission objective.\nIn this paper, a brief description of mission definition with its associated payloads\nis presented and, then, following a satellite system design overview with its trade\nanalyses is discussed. Note that the system design consideration is based on the fact\nthat the mission is switched from former joining RapidEye constellation to the cur-\nrently so-called Formosat-2 continuation mission due to unexpected surprise. Also,\nthe satellite itself is composed of a bus platform of the intended heritage design with\nLEON-3 central processing unit (CPU) inside the on-board computer and accommo-\ndated with two categories of payloads for the remote-sensing application and various\nscientific missions.

Weng et al.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nStarting from 1991, three consecutive space missions were executed successfully\nby National Space Organization (NSPO) in Taiwan. Formosat-1, Formosat-2, and\nFormosat-3 are the names for those three that associated with different missions of\nscience research, earth observation, and weather forecast, respectively. While each\nindividual project was contracted to the corresponding satellite prime contractor ac-\ncountable for the spacecraft development, many scientists, engineers, and managers\nfrom NSPO and other research institutes in Taiwan also earned hands-on experi-\nence by working with contractors side-by-side from the beginning to the end of the\nproject. Seasoned skill has been built up and sound knowledge accumulated as well\non every learner since then. Among them, Formosat-2 that was launched in May\n2004 has performed an outstanding job in the field of disaster monitoring, such as\nearthquake, mud flood, land slide, tsunami flooding, typhoon/hurricane raid, and so\non. By taking a look at the aforementioned remote-sensing images, we can certainly\nfind that the earth environment is critical to everyone living in the world.\n\nIn this paper, a satellite system overview after the completion of preliminary\ndesign review (PDR) is presented. The satellite itself is composed of an intended\nheritage bus platform design with LEON-3 central processing unit (CPU) inside\nthe on-board computer and accommodated with two categories of payloads for the\nremote-sensing application and various scientific missions. The earth observation\ninstrument is designated as the primary payload, and the other five science payloads\nare attached on the bus external surface to perform both space and marine exper-\niments. In addition, due to gaining export license permit from vendor-governed\nauthority has been also an uncertainty to the program from the past experience,\nespecially in such a complicated political environment. To overcome this restriction,\nuse of commercial off the shelf (COTS) parts as many as we can, without shading\nthe light of Taiwan first ever self-developed mission success is clearly a challenge\nto us. In attitude determination design, commercially available global positioning\nsystem receiver (GPSR) and a number of redundant fiber optic gyros are adopted\nwith the star tracker for hardware implementation. COTS up-screening/qualification\nand validation/verification process is used to ensure their normal functions when\noperating in the severe space environments later on in the orbit.\n\n2 Mission\n\nThe mission was originally intended for joining RapidEye constellation, becoming\nthe 6th member of the family. The main purpose of the RapidEye mission, owned by\nRapidEye AG, Germany, is to establish a global monitoring service for agriculture,\nforest, disaster, and cartography while a constellation of five satellites deployed on\na sun synchronous orbit will provide continuous observation of the earth. The polar\norbit makes the global coverage possible and, with rolling spacecraft across 25 de-\ngrees each side, the global revisit time is within one day. A spacecraft preliminary\n\n\n\nIndigenous Mission of Satellite System Development Program in Taiwan 347\n\ndesign review based on the RapidEye earth observation mission payload and satellite\nplatform performances [1] has been passed [2] and then the work was conducted\ntoward the critical design stage. However, the mission was terminated at this point\nunfortunately because the export permit, a required contractual document, had not\nbeen authorized to the mission support contractor. Thus the mission is revised to\ncontinue the Formosat-2 mission. Although different imaging payload will be used,\nit is still an earth observation satellite attached with original science instruments\nto tackle on the space research and application. As a Formosat-2 follow-on mis-\nsion, the primary goals are remote sensing applications for natural disaster evalua-\ntion, agriculture application, urban planning, environmental monitoring and ocean\nsurveillance over Taiwan area and its surrounding oceans.\n\n3 Payloads\n\nTwo types of payloads, distinguished them from primary and secondary, are installed\non the spacecraft bus to fulfill the mission. One optical remote sensing instrument\nis chosen as the primary to serve the purpose of civil application, and five science\ninstruments are designed to perform space research and marine data collection.\n\n3.1 Remote Sensing Instrument\n\nThe Remote Sensing Instrument (RSI) aboard of Formosat-2 spacecraft provides\n2 m and 8 m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) in Panchromatic band and Multi-\nspectral (MS) bands, respectively, over 24 km ground swath in the nadir direction.\nSimilarly, the primary payload for the indigenous mission shall be targeting on the\nsame performance level as, or even better than, what Formosat-2 possesses.\n\n3.2 Science Instruments\n\nThe science instruments planned for the mission cover the research applications in\nboth marine and space fields. One payload dedicated to the marine application and\nfour payloads for space research are proposed and their introductions are described\nbriefly in the following sections.\n\n3.2.1 Marine Science Application\n\nThe traditional way to collect the ecosystem factors of Coral Reefs is mainly by\nship. The frequency of data collection can range monthly to quarterly. An infrastruc-\nture that is composed of several segments of underwater sensors, floating platform,\nsatellite communication payload, and ground station is introduced for the mission\nto efficiently collect the marine ecosystem factors with a higher frequency.\n\n\n\n348 S.-L. Weng et al.\n\n3.2.2 Space Science Application\n\n\u201cLiving with a Star\u201d is already an important topic of the space science research.\nTo understand and model the space environment variation around the Earth, four\npayloads has been proposed to perform in-situ measurements, which includes mag-\nnetometer, electron spectrometer, ion mass and energy spectrometer, and neutral\nparticle analyzer. With these four instruments operating simultaneously, one can get\nthe full picture of space environment variations around the Earth.\n\n4 Spacecraft Bus Design\n\nAs stated in the previous paragraph, the spacecraft is originally designed for joining\nthe RapidEye constellation. However, the mission has been revised to be the NSPO\nself-developed remote sensing satellite for the continuation purpose of Formosat-2\nmission. As a stand-alone remote sensing satellite, it is designed, with cost effi-\nciency, to be capable of possessing multiple operation modes, including large field\nof regard, high agility for multi-tasking, mosaic, and stereo imaging, large duty\ncycle, and fine attitude control accuracy. The current design of spacecraft origi-\nnally aiming at mission of RapidEye constellation, passing the PDR milestone, is\noctagonal shape with body mounted solar array. However, to be properly suited\nfor the modified mission of increasing duty cycle, deployment of solar array(s) is\nconsidered as mandatory for the mission. To conquer the challenge of not making\ndramatic design change, several options have been studied to upgrade performance\nof the existing design.\n\n4.1 Flight Scenario\n\nAfter detailed mission analysis, 639 km altitude sun-synchronous orbit is selected\nas the mission orbit. It can provide mean 1.68-day revisit cycle for 45-degree field\nof regard at 24 degree latitude. The influence of orbit degradation to mean revisit\ncycle is pretty low, which implies low orbit maintenance frequency and effort. The\nspacecraft bus flying at lower altitude orbit can relieve the difficulty in the design of\nremote sensing instrument. Also, flying at lower altitude orbit can expand the avail-\nability of small launch vehicles for this class of small satellite. Imaging area will\ncover from +60 degrees North latitude to ?40 degrees South latitude. The science\nmission will be allowed to perform experiment from eclipse until +70 degrees North\nlatitude. The spacecraft will be always kept earth-oriented for the best operation for\nboth imaging and science missions except for the period of changing to sun pointing\nafter imaging in order to generate more solar power.\n\n\n\nIndigenous Mission of Satellite System Development Program in Taiwan 349\n\nFig. 1 Satellite ground track\nfor 639 km sun synchronous\norbit\n\n\u20135\n\n10\n\n25\n\n40\n\n55\n\n75 90 105 120 135 150 165\nL\n\nat\nitu\n\nde\n (\n\nde\ng \n\nN\n)\n\nLongitude (deg E)\n\nFOR=45 deg\n\nEclipse\n\nSun pointing\n\nSun light\n\nScience Mission\n\nImaging\n\nFig. 2 Flight attitude in orbit\n\n4.2 Configuration of Solar Array and Structure\n\nBody configuration choices have been studied and trade analyses are given below.\nOut of the above three options, the configuration of octagonal shape with two\n\ndeployed solar arrays is selected as the best design currently. Although solar power\ngeneration will depend on the solar arrays configuration, shortage of power output\nof option 1 compared with options 2 and 3 is not likely to jeopardize a mission.\nBesides, we believe that the actual output power will surely be improved after the\ncompletion of critical design review stage. High agility capability is not a mandatory\nrequirement for the RapidEye earth observation mission as Formosat-2 requires. In\norder to catch up with the Formosat-2 mission performance, reaction wheels adopted\noriginally needs to be upgraded with higher torque output capacity to increase agility\n\n\n\n350 S.-L.

Although the option selected does not provide the highest solar\npower generation and minimum moment of inertia, it possesses the highest flexi-\nbility to support any future earth-observation and space science mission for a small\nsatellite development in Taiwan.\n\n4.3 Shape Redesign of Solar Array\n\n4.3.1 Influence on RSI Accommodation Volume\n\nFor intended RSI to be installed on the top panel, more space is needed compared\nwith RapidEye payload. In original design, two tapered and symmetric solar arrays\nare used. To fully utilize space constraint imposed by the launch vehicle fairing, two\nun-symmetric, rectangular solar arrays are used. The shorter array is trying to leave\nmore room for relieving the length constraint of telescope design. The taller array\ncan compensate the reduced solar power from the small one and produce the same\ntotal solar power output.\n\n\n\nIndigenous Mission of Satellite System Development Program in Taiwan 351\n\n(a) Original solar array design (b) New solar array design\n\nFig. 3 Different solar arrays design (a) Original solar array design, (b) New solar array design\n\n4.3.2 Influence on S-band Antenna Coverage\n\nOriginal S-band antenna arrangement is the one facing the nadir and the other fac-\ning 45-degree off the zenith, which can produce about 87 % coverage. To enhance\nthe reliability during contigency operation, if occurred, and also take advantage of\ncreated space resulting from the newly designed shorter solar array arrangement,\nthe original 45-degree off zenith antenna is moved to face the zenith to increase\nthe coverage ratio. The only blockage of this arrangement is from the shorter solar\narray. However, the best location will be adjusted after mock-up testing.\n\nFig. 4 S-band Antenna\nInstallation\n\n(a) With original solar arrays (b) With new solar arrays\n\n4.4 Upgrade of Agility Capability\n\nAs an earth-observation satellite, the agility capability in both roll and pitch axes is\nvery important to the imaging performance. Larger reaction wheels are selected to\nreplace the small ones for the new mission. Although the moment of inertia of roll\nand pitch axes deviates 100 %, the agility requirement for both axes is designed to\nmaintain at the same level. In order to produce same agility capability in roll and\npitch axes, the installation angle of reaction wheels has to be optimized to distribute\nmore torque in pitch axis than in roll axis.\n\n\n\n352 S.-L. Weng et al.\n\nFig. 5 Optimization of\nreaction wheels installation\nangles\n\nPitch  (Y)\n\nYaw (Z)\n\n4.5 Thermal Control of RSI\n\nThe thermal control of RapidEye payload is managed directly by the spacecraft\nbus. Since RSI is a very high precision instrument, the tolerance of thermal control\nis much smaller than spacecraft bus. To reduce impact to the spacecraft develop-\nment when replacing RapidEye payload by RSI, the separation of thermal control\nphilosophy of spacecraft bus and RSI has been enforced. Also, if future earth ob-\nservation missions are taken into account, separate thermal control will make the\nspacecraft design more flexible to support different missions.\n\n5 Leon 3 CPU Onboard Computer\n\nThe onboard computer, CDMU (Command & Data Management Unit), with LEON-3\nCPU embedded has been indigenously developed for the current spacecraft bus and\ndeemed, intended to be a heritage design for the future flight. It possesses capabilities\nof interface and control to all avionics by on board autonomy, of parameter change\nand application software exchange vie telemetry/command contact, of provision of\nmemory storage space for science instruments, and of onboard fault management\ncontrol. The CDMU itself also has the capability of board-level redundancy control\nof another CDMU redundant unit. The LEON-3 CPU, by Gaisler Research, is a 32-bit\nsynthesisable processor core based on the SPARC V8 architecture. It is chosen for its\nadvantages over another such as its high level of configurability and fault immunity,\nthe wide availability of the source code, a deeper pipeline and multi-processor support,\nand its suitability for the system-on-a-chip (SOC) design through its implementation\nin a flight qualified FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array).\n\n\n\nIndigenous Mission of Satellite System Development Program in Taiwan 353\n\n6 COTS Components\n\nFlying the COTS components in space does not imply lower quality or poorer re-\nliability. In order to ensure those adopted COTS components meeting the mission\nrequirements, one needs to develop a verification approach to perform the task of\nup-screening or qualification to upgrade those COTS components toward higher\nlevel because the existing COTS components are not MIL or space qualified ones\nyet. Two COTS components, gyro and GPSR, intended to fly with the spacecraft\nhave to gone through the whole process of verification approach to confirm their\nfunctional capability. The ? FOR-6U gyro manufactured by LITEF, Germany, is\na highly-integrated single-axis fiber optic rate sensor to measure the inertial rate\nof the spacecraft. It is designed for the commercial and military application. The\nPhoenix GPSR is developed by German Space Operation Center (GSOC) of DLR\n(German Aerospace Center) for highly dynamic and space applications. It employs\na commercially available hardware platform based on MG5001 receiver hardware,\nwhich is developed and manufactured by Sigtec Navigation Pty, Australia. The\nMG5001 hardware is also originally designed for terrestrial application only and\nentirely based on COTS hardware.\n\n7 Conclusion\n\nThe mission is the first program designed and developed indigenously by Taiwanese\nwithout introducing a prime contractor from a foreign country like we did before for\nFormosat-1, -2, and -3. An advanced LEON-3 CPU is aggressively chosen in the on-\nboard computer trying to make the heritage design staying ahead and competitive\nfor years to come. Flying with COTS components through sequence of verification\napproach provides a breakthrough in the space program development in Taiwan.\nSwitching design concept and operation scenario from RapidEye constellation mis-\nsion to Formosat-2 continuation mission, unwillingly scratching out part of PDR\ndesign accomplishment and still keeping procured components in use without hard-\nware cost surge, has been accomplished by NSPO design team at the expense of the\nexperience gained from the past space programs. A small satellite system has been\ndeveloped through the execution of the indigenous mission. This satellite system\nis going to be capable of orbiting NSPO\u2019s future potential combination of earth\nobservation and space science mission with necessary modification.\n\nReferences\n\n1. F.

The small spacecraft represents the highest GSD achieved for any spacecraft\nof such mass and size, yet is designed as a tool to provide high duty cycle commer-\ncial operational services.\n\nThe spacecraft provides a large data storage capacity with solid-state storage\naugmented by hard drives modified for use in space, allowing the instrument to map\nlong 4000 km swaths. A software configurable image compressor and high speed\nX-band downlink permit both store and forward, as well as real-time downlinking.\nFinally, a high degree of agility permits the spacecraft to access a 600 km wide\nfield-of-regard.\n\nThe mission addresses a range of applications in high-resolution mapping and\ndisaster monitoring, including land cover analysis for the Chinese territories, preci-\nsion agriculture, geological surveying, urban development.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nSmall Earth Observation satellite missions have become increasingly sophisticated.\nFor many years, SSTL has supplied small spacecraft carrying imaging instruments,\nand as the small satellite technology has matured, it has become possible to serve\n\nA. da Silva Curiel\nSurrey Satellite Technology Ltd, Surrey Space Centre, Guildford, Surrey, GU2, 7YE, UK\ne-mail: A.da-Silva-Curiel@sstl.co.uk\n\nL.

The\nprimary challenge for such missions is to provide sufficient utility in terms of system\ncapacity.\n\nState-of-the-art solutions can be identified by plotting the Ground Sampling Dis-\ntance versus spacecraft mass for recently launched, and near-term missions (Fig. 1).\nAlthough metric class mission applications are well served by various commercial\nventures, these missions are targeted at a multitude of applications, and are not well\nconfigured to provide a rapid response time, data freshness, synopticity (area cap-\ntured per opportunity), or priority for any single particular user.\n\nTOPSAT and Beijing-1 are aimed at providing some of these features specifi-\ncally, and provide the best GSD achieved so far given their mass class. By ensuring\nthe mission is affordable, each can provide a dedicated mission solution addressing\nthe needs of a single customer and end-user. Beijing-1 in particular is configured\nas an operational, general-purpose mapping mission, with high on-board storage\ncapacity and downlink rate. It also provides an exceptional degree of synopticity\nwith over 4000 km mapping and downlinking capability every orbit.\n\nMission Launch GSD Mass\nQuickBird-2 2002 0.61 980\nIKONOS-1 2000 1 726\nORBVIEW-4 2002 1 368\nIGS-1a 2003 1 850\nORBVIEW-3 2004 1 300\nKOMPSAT-2 2005 1 470\nIRS Cartosat-2 2007 1 680\nEROS-A 2001 1.8 280\nEROS-B 2006 1.8 280\nFormosat-2 2004 2 764\nSPOT-5 2002 2.5 3030\nIRS-P5 (Cartosat) 2004 2.5 1500\nBelKa 2006 2.5 750\nTOPSAT - SSTL 2006 2.85 112\nALOS 2006 2.5 4000\nRazakSat-1 2007 2.5 200\nEarlybird 1998 3 310\nOFEQ-5 2002 3 300\nBeijing-1 - SSTL 2006 4 168\nLewis 1998 5 288\nPROBA-1 2002 5 120\nLAPAN-TUBSAT 2007 6 56\n\nHigh resolution EO mission\nGSD achieved for a spacecraft mass\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nMass (kg)\n\nG\nS\n\nD\n (\n\nm\n)\n\nTOPSAT\n\nBeijing-1\n\n150010005000\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 1 (a) Summary of high-resolution EO missions and (b) plot of GSD vs spacecraft mass\n\n2 The Beijing-1 Mission\n\nThe Beijing-1 mission is targeted at an operational mapping mission, with its sub-\nsystems and payload specified at providing the best data transfer for such a space-\ncraft available over its lifetime, given its size and budget constraints.\n\nBeijing-1, also known as China DMC +4, was designed and manufactured by\nSurrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) of Guildford, United Kingdom, for\nthe private company \u201cBeijing LandView Mapping Information Technology Co\u201d.\n(BLMIT), of Beijing, China, as the space segment of the Beijing-1 project. The space-\ncraft was launched together with TOPSAT on a COSMOS launcher in October 2005.\n\n\n\nResults from the Beijing-1 Operational High Resolution Small Satellite 359\n\nThe project comprised also the installation in Beijing of a Mission Control\nCentre, consisting of an S-band ground station and associated control systems, and\nthe support to the customer payload data X-band ground station. Designed from the\nbeginning as a pure mapping mission, the project aims at providing the Chinese mar-\nket with yearly high resolution mapping of the Chinese territory. Special attention is\nbeing given to the large amount of building work being done for the Olympic Games\nin Beijing, since the mission allows re-mapping of the urban area every 3\u20134 days,\nat 4 meter ground sampling distance (GSD), a useful capacity in rapidly changing\nurban environments. The satellite was designed to map the entire Chinese territory\nevery six month, at 4-meter resolution in Pan-chromatic mode.\n\n3 Spacecraft Overview\n\nBeijing-1 employs the SSTL-150 platform, with all the capabilities of the Disaster\nMonitoring Constellation (DMC) platform, plus a high performance 4-meter GSD\nimager with its own payload data processing, storage and transmission chain.\n\nThe small 168 kg satellite carries a panchromatic imaging instrument providing\n4-metre Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) with 24 km swath. In addition it also car-\nries an ultrawide swath with multi-spectral camera with 32-metre GSD and 600 km\nswath as carried by the other satellites within the Disaster Monitoring Constellation.\n\nAlthough the standard platform capabilities can be tailored, for the Beijing-1\nmission, these include a sophisticated and agile attitude control system that allows\n30? off track roll maneuvers. It also includes an on-board hardware data compres-\nsion, using a fully re-programmable high capability DSP unit, 4 Gbytes of volatile\nmass data storage, 240 Gbytes of non-volatile mass data storage (fully re-writable\non demand), data encryption and the downlink, providing data transfer rates at 8\n(in S-band), 20 and 40 Mbit/sec (in X-band). The 4-meter GSD imager is based on\na lightweight mapping telescope with in-orbit focusing capability. It was developed\nby the Optical Payloads Group within SSTL.\n\nThe modular and configurable platform features make it a very powerful Earth ob-\nservation tool, at a relatively very low cost. The mission can be operated in several dif-\nferent modes, each optimised for a specific objective. These modes are re-configurable\nfrom the ground, and new ones can be tailored as required by the operators.\n\nThe 4-metre instrument is a compact on-axis telescope, providing high quality\nmapping data. It is designed specifically so that it can be scaled and carried on a\nrange of small satellites. It employs an athermal carbon fibre composite structure\nto provide good stability, and permits on-orbit adjustment of focus. These design\nchoices for the telescope yield a cost effective solution and the ability to deal with\na large temperature range without active thermal control, which significantly eases\nthe satellite design and operating complexity.\n\nThe main points of the specification together with the parameters achieved are\ngiven in Table 1, and the reference conditions for these parameters in Table 2. This\nshows that all design goals were met or exceeded, and that in particular a high level\nof Signal To Noise level is achieved.\n\n\n\n360 A.S.

This was then imaged over a number passes, whilst the relevant ground\nreflectances and atmospheric conditions were monitored at the same time. Other\nfeatures in the resulting images including water, soil, live vegetation, and dead vege-\ntation were also utilized to provide a range of reflectances to measure the instrument\nlinearity of response.\n\nThe results verified that the Ground Sampling Distance is 4 m as per the design,\nand that the linearity of response.

Specifically, the use of such spacecraft\nsolutions in constellations is highly promising to address high temporal resolution\nrequirements. A wide range of applications are supported\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Its mission orbit is sun-synchronous of 891 km altitude for exactly 14\nrevolutions per day. For earth observation, the payload is an advanced high resolu-\ntion remote sensing instrument (RSI) with ground sampling distance (GSD) 2 m in\npanchromatic (PAN) band and 8 m in four multi-spectral (MS) bands. For upward\nlightning observation, the payload is an imager of sprites and upper atmospheric\nlightning (ISUAL). Launch date of FORMOSAT-2 was on 20 May 2004. After\nnearly 3 years of mission operations in orbit, i.e., more than one half of the mission\nlife of 5 years, it is a proper time to assess and evaluate its worldwide effectiveness\nin Earth observation. To evaluate the effectiveness of developing a satellite, espe-\ncially to a country with very limited resources such as Taiwan, we need to include\nall aspects. This paper gives the global effectiveness of FORMOSAT-2 a rather\ndetailed assessment from the following areas: public education in Taiwan, Earth\nscience and ecological niche research, preservation of the world heritages, contribu-\ntion to the International Charter: space and major disasters, observation of suspected\nnorth Korea and Iranian nuclear facilities, and scientific observation of the atmo-\nspheric transient luminous events (TLEs).

The development of\nFORMOSAT-2 is very valuable, not only to Taiwan but also to the whole world.\n\n1 Introduction\n\nFORMOSAT-2 is the first remote sensing satellite (RSS) owned by the National\nSpace Organization (NSPO) of Taiwan for the purposes of earth and upward light-\nning observation. It is a small satellite of 746 kg mass for two remote sensing\nmissions. Its mission orbit is sun-synchronous of 891 km altitude for exactly 14\nrevolutions per day. For earth observation, the payload is an advanced high resolu-\ntion remote sensing instrument (RSI) with ground sampling distance (GSD) 2 m in\npanchromatic (PAN) band and 8 m in four multi-spectral (MS) bands. For upward\nlightning observation, the payload is an imager of sprites and upper atmospheric\nlightning (ISUAL). [1\u20134]It was launched from Vandenberg, California on 20 May\n2004. After nearly 3 years of mission operations (MO), it is a proper time to make\nan assessment of FORMOSAT-2\u2019s effectiveness to the world.\n\nOne of the ways to analyze the effectiveness of an RSS is simply to consider the\ncost. However, it can also be assessed and evaluated from both the direct and indi-\nrect effectiveness. In Reference 5, FORMOSAT-2\u2019s cost effectiveness to Taiwan had\nbeen discussed. In this paper, we try to investigate FORMOSAT-2\u2019s effectiveness to\nthe world from the following five areas: public education in Taiwan, Earth science\nand ecological niche research, preservation of the world heritages, contribution to\nthe International Charter: space and major disasters, observation of suspected north\nKorea and Iranian nuclear facilities, and scientific observation of the atmospheric\ntransient luminous events (TLEs).\n\n2 Public Education in Taiwan\n\n2.1 Student Activities before FORMOSAT-2 Launch[6]\n\nThe student activities for celebrating FORMOSAT-2 launch were initiated by the\nAerospace Science and Technology Research Center (ASTRC) of the National\nCheng Kung University (NCKU) on 20 August 2003. All students of elementary,\njunior high and senior high schools were invited. There are four categories: call\nfor \u201cName\u201d, \u201cPainting\u201d, \u201cArticle\u201d and \u201cPlan\u201d. The \u201cName\u201d must be simple but\nmeaningful to represent FORMOSAT-2. Size of the \u201cPainting\u201d should be the A3\nsize, i.e., 29.5 cm \u00d7 42 cm. In the category of call for \u201cArticle\u201d, the students were\nrequested to write a short paper about the development, missions, configuration,\ncharacteristics, etc. of FORMOSAT-2. Then in the category of call for plan, the\nstudents were encouraged to design a detailed plan for using the RSI or ISUAL\nobservation results. The deadline of submission was 10 November 2003.\n\nA total of 333 submissions had been received with the following distribution:\ncall for name 122, call for painting 133, call for article 42 and call for plan 36.\n\n\n\nAn Introduction to FORMOSAT-2\u2019s Global Effectiveness 367\n\nThe winning name is \u201cFormosa #2\u201d and the winning painting is shown in Fig. 1(a).\nThis name leads to the change of the satellite from ROCSAT-2 to FORMOSAT-2.\nIt is seen from Fig. 1(b) that the winning painting was painted on the fairing of the\nlaunch vehicle. This is another great honor to the winner.\n\n2.2 Publication of Calendars for Children and General\nPublic Educations[6]\n\nUnder the authorization of NSPO, the Newtonkids Book Company published cal-\nendars in both 2006 and 2007 for children education purpose. On the other hand,\nNSPO published calendar for the general public education purpose. NSPO selected\n12 FORMOSAT-2 images captured in 2005 and 2006 to publish the calendars of\n2006 and 2007, respectively.\n\n2.3 URMAP (Your Map) System[6]\n\nThe OleMap Incorporation started to develop the URMAP system at about two years\nago. It is already a very mature system and handy for application by the general\npublic or the foreign travelers in Taiwan. There are three kinds of maps, satellite\nimage, regular and electronic.\n\nFig. 1 First prize painting\nand its appearance on\nFORMOSAT-2 launch\nvehicle\n\n(a)                                       (b)\n\n3 Earth Science and Ecological Niche\n\n3.1 Ice Crack Observed in Alert, Canada\n\nIn the Alert area of Canada, FORMOSAT-2 observed an ice crack in three consec-\nutive days from 24 to 26 March 2006 in exact the same time everyday by using its\ndaily revisit characteristics. As shown in Fig. 2, the width of the ice crack varied\nfrom about 600\u2013800 m wide to narrower and then to even wider than the first day.\nNSPO provided this information to interested scientists for study and investigation.\nFigure 3 shows the same area after 1 year.\n\n\n\n368 J.-S.

Dongsha Islands are to\nthe east but not too far away from Taiwan Island. [5]The complete coral reef and\nabundant ecological environment have made Dongsha Atoll a fascinating place for\nresearchers worldwide. The Ayers rock and its surrounding area had been imaged\nby FORMOSAT-2 as shown in Fig. 4(b). These two examples mean that NSPO\nalso provides images related to ecological environment for the research and analysis\nof the ecological resources, and for the participation and promotion of the global\necological preservation and research activities.\n\n4 Preservation of the World Heritages\n\nPreservation and protection of the world heritages is one of the important jobs of\nthe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\nWith its high resolution, FORMOSAT-2 took the image of a castle named Jiayuguan\n(Fig. 5(a)) of the Great Wall in China.

Because of NSPO is in coop-\neration with the Spot Image Company of France for the commercial promotion of\nFORMOSAT-2 images, the source of the images is shown as \u201cSpot/Formosat-2\u201d\nin the Charter\u2019s website. Since NSPO joined the Charter, Spot/NSPO has provided\nimages captured by FORMOSAT-2 in 20 events as listed in Table 1. Some of the\nimages are presented in Fig. 6 for reference.\n\n6 Suspected North Korea and Iranian Nuclear Facilities\n\nUsing the daily revisit advantage, FORMOSAT-2\u2019s orbit 1 comes from north to\nsouth and passes over North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, etc. at exactly the same\ntime everyday. Therefore, it is very convenient for FORMOSAT-2 to take the image\nof North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities. Figure 7(a) shows the distribution of those facil-\nities, and 7(b) is the suspected nuclear test site. The epicenter of the site predicted\nby US is as shown in the figure.\n\nAnother country tried to reestablish and reuse its nuclear facilities is Iran. The\ndaily revisit and radiometric characteristics of FORMOSAT-2 make its observation\nso valuable for analysts to understand the status. As shown in Fig. 8, the reestablish-\nment of the surfacing work and the construction of the reactor had been completed\nfrom 10 May to 1 July 2005.\n\n(a) Nuclear facilities of North Korea (b) Epicenter predicted by US\n\nEpicenter\npredicted\nby US\n\nFig. 7 North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities and suspected nuclear test site (a) Nuclear facilities of North\nKorea (b) Epicenter predicted by US (October 2006)\n\n\n\n374 J.-S. Chern et al.\n\n7 Atmospheric Transient Luminous Events (TLES)\n\nFORMOSAT-2\u2019s scientific payload ISUAL has captured 4219 emissions of light\nand VLF perturbation due to EMP sources (ELVES), 487 red sprites, 486 halos\nand 9 gigantic jets (GJ) (VLF = very low frequency, EMP = electromagnetic pulse).\nIn other words, a total of 5201 TLEs have been observed within 2.5 years. [7] In\norder to protect the instrument, ISUAL is not operational when FORMOSAT-2 is\npassing the Southern Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. Since FORMOSAT-2 is the\nfirst satellite to observe TLEs from orbit, the results are very valuable. Space physics\nscientists are analyzing these natural phenomena.\n\nFig. 8 Establishment of Iranian heavy water production plant observed in 2005\n\n8 Conclusions\n\nFORMOSAT-2, the first Earth observation remote sensing satellite (RSS) of Taiwan,\nhas been working on its mission orbit of 891 km for nearly 3 years. This paper\ngives the global effectiveness of FORMOSAT-2 a rather detailed assessment from\nthe following areas: public education in Taiwan, Earth science and ecological niche\nresearch, preservation of the world heritages, contribution to the International Char-\nter: space and major disasters, observation of suspected north Korea and Iranian\nnuclear facilities, and scientific observation of the atmospheric transient luminous\nevents (TLEs). It can be concluded that FORMOSAT-2\u2019s global effectiveness is\npronounced and definitely promised. The development of FORMOSAT-2 is very\nvaluable, not only to Taiwan but also to the whole world.\n\n\n\nAn Introduction to FORMOSAT-2\u2019s Global Effectiveness 375\n\nReferences\n\n1. J. S.

Rapid end-to-end timeliness has\nbeen combined with a low-cost approach, leading to a world leading performance-\nto-cost ratio.\n\nHistorically, end-to-end timeliness has been a major constraint for space-based\nsystems. During demonstrations using the TopSat spacecraft and RAPIDS mobile\nground station, a total end-to-end timeliness (i.e. from image selection to image\ndelivery) of less than 37 minutes was achieved.\n\nTopSat and missions of this class are set to revolutionise the space remote sensing\nbusiness, through reductions in costs and thus greater numbers of spacecraft. This\nwill allow missions to be tailored much more exclusively to the requirements of\nmajor users.\n\n1 Spacecraft\n\n1.1 Overview\n\nThe TopSat satellite, built by a QinetiQ-led consortium, was launched on 27th Oc-\ntober 2005. It has a mass of 108 kg and consists of a novel optical payload, which\nis integrated with a low-cost small satellite platform. It produces panchromatic im-\nagery (17\u00d717 km) with a spatial resolution of 2.8 m and overlapping multi-spectral\nimagery (12\u00d718 km) with 5.6 m resolution. The panchromatic imagery can be geo-\nrectified to better than 50 m absolute localisation using 4 GCPs [1].\n\nE.

Levett\n\nFig. 1 The TopSat spacecraft\nduring final testing\n\nRemarkably, the spacecraft (and operations) were developed and launched for\nunder \u20ac20M, resulting in a world leading performance-to-cost-ratio. Although built\nas a technology demonstrator and not an operational system, TopSat has already\n\nFig. 2 TopSat image of Venice, Italy, 14th March 2007\n\n\n\nTopSat: Lessons Learned from a Small Satellite Mission 379\n\nsustained eighteen months of intensive use, routinely delivering 4 images per day.\nImages have been provided to the UK MoD, BNSC, academic community and\ncommercial customers, as well as supporting a technical development programme\nsponsored by the TopSat Consortium.\n\n1.2 Low-Cost Approach\n\nThe TopSat programme demonstrates a low-cost approach to responsive space\nmissions. The spacecraft was developed with a design-to-cost approach, with app-\nropriate re-use of existing technologies and facilities. The ground segment was\nbased around COTS software and uses a high level of automation.\n\nIn addition, TopSat was launched on a shared launch vehicle \u2013 a Cosmos-3M\nrocket from Plesetsk, Russia. This was enabled by the size and low mass of the\nspacecraft, made possible by the innovative camera design.\n\n2 Ground Segment\n\nThe spacecraft is operated from the Payload Operations Centre at Farnborough in\nthe UK, often working in close communication with users to meet specialised re-\nquirements. During routine operations, imagery is downloaded to QinetiQ\u2019s ground\nstation at West Freugh in Scotland. Imagery can also be rapidly down-linked through\nthe mobile ground station, RAPIDS (see Section 3.2).\n\n3 Rapid End-to-End Timeliness\n\nTopSat\u2019s rapid end-to-end timeliness capability make it ideally suited to work within\ntight timescales; whether for disaster relief, news gathering or security applications.\nFigure 3 shows an image of Kashmir taken for the Durham Landslide Centre, in\n\nFig. 3 TopSat image of a landslide in Kashmir, 27th September 2006\n\n\n\n380 E. Baxter, B. Levett\n\nsupport of a study into the use of TopSat in the assessment of disaster impact.\nAdditional imagery for the centre was used to provide casualty estimates from Ty-\nphoon Bilis [2].\n\n3.1 Responsive Tasking\n\nA key element of TopSat operations is the responsiveness of the image tasking pro-\ncess. Payload operations are scheduled using the TopSat Operations Management\nsoftware (TOM) \u2013 developed by QinetiQ to work in conjunction with AGI\u2019s Satellite\nTool Kit and Scheduler packages.\n\nTOM allows the scheduling process to respond readily to space and ground seg-\nment constraints, in addition to varying imagery requirements. Payload command\nfiles can be generated for upload to the spacecraft in a matter of minutes, and\nthe scheduling process can be readily extended to cope with larger task and image\nthroughputs.\n\nFig. 4 The TOM software\n\nAccess to the TopSat imagery archive catalogue and co-ordination of requests\nbetween imagery users is encouraged through a web-based analysis tool. Users can\nview thumbnails of archive images, in addition to image details such as date of ac-\nquisition. Combining this with the TOM Software would make scheduling directly\ncontrollable by the end user, allowing a faster image tasking to delivery time and\nlower operations costs.\n\n3.2 Direct-to User Down-Linking\n\nTopSat imagery can be rapidly down-linked through the use of a mobile ground\nstation, providing near real-time imagery directly to a field-based user. QinetiQ has\nenhanced the fully transportable RAPIDS ground station, with system electronics\nand image processing computers mounted in a customised Land Rover Defender.\n\n\n\nTopSat: Lessons Learned from a Small Satellite Mission 381\n\nFig. 5 TopSat image request analysis tool\n\nFig. 6 The RAPIDS mobile ground station\n\n3.3 End-to-End Timeliness Demonstrations\n\nIn January 2007, several end-to-end timeliness demonstrations were conducted by\nthe TopSat Consortium, emulating the tasking of the TopSat satellite directly with\nan uplink facility located within a theatre of operations, and the provision of fresh\nimagery into theatre through a deployed data ground station.\n\nImagery was commanded, acquired, down-linked and processed within a single\nimage pass, achieving an end-to-end timeliness using the mobile ground station of\nless than 37 minutes.\n\n3.4 Online Hosting of Imagery\n\nIn order to provide in-theatre access to the highest resolution image files even with-\nout the use of a mobile ground station, a web-based image browsing interface has\n\n\n\n382 E. Baxter, B. Levett\n\nbeen developed for TopSat imagery, in which full resolution geo-rectified imagery\nis made available for viewing with relatively low-bandwidth.\n\nFig. 7 Web browser tool\n\n4 Mission Status\n\nThe TopSat Consortium consists of four UK partners: QinetiQ (who lead the\nmission, provide the on-board data handling unit, data down-links and Payload\nOperations Centre); the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL, who designed and\nbuilt the onboard camera); Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL, who built\nthe satellite platform and provide TT&C services); and Infoterra Ltd (who are re-\nsponsible for the development of commercial data markets).\n\nFig. 8 TopSat image of a\nmeteor crater in Arizona, 6th\nFebruary 2007\n\nThe programme, originally funded by the British National Space Centre and\nthe UK Ministry of Defence, has since become a commercial venture between the\n\n\n\nTopSat: Lessons Learned from a Small Satellite Mission 383\n\nTopSat consortium partners. During this time, the TopSat Consortium has embarked\non a series of experiments to demonstrate the performance of the system, both in\nimage timeliness and image quality.\n\n5 Lessons Learned\n\nThe main lessons learned from the TopSat programme have been as follows:\n\n\u2013 The challenges associated with developing an extremely compact, high perfor-\nmance camera can be overcome.\n\n\u2013 Mounting a sensitive, high-performance optical payload on a micro-satellite plat-\nform is possible.\n\n\u2013 Low-cost ground segment facilities can enable extremely fast data turnaround.\n\u2013 A disparate consortium can be made to work without large administrative over-\n\nheads, as long as significant face-to-face contact is maintained.\n\nFig. 9 TopSat image of\nMt Fuji, Japan, 6th February\n2007\n\n6 Conclusions\n\nThe overriding achievement of the TopSat mission is the successful design, con-\nstruction, launch and operation of a micro-satellite capable of sustaining routine\ntasking at a cost of less than \u20ac20M. The key to this was combining high quality\nimagery and rapid end-to-end timeliness with a low-cost approach. This required\nconsiderable technical and programmatic challenges to be overcome.\n\nBy virtue of its small size and low cost, TopSat-has opened the way for affordable\nconstellations capable of launch on a single small launch vehicle. In the case of\nimaging spacecraft, this will reduce image costs and increase the availability of\n\n\n\n384 E. Baxter, B. Levett\n\ndata. The TopSat low-cost approach can be used in the future to develop even more\ncapable missions, opening the door to an even wider community of users.\n\nFig. 10 TopSat image of the\nGreat Pyramids, 18th January\n2007\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Sunay, Neslin I?smailoglu, Tunahan K?r?lmaz, Celal Dudak,\nand Ozlem A. Sen\n\nAbstract Main purpose of this study is to design a transmitter with data rates up\nto 100 Mbps, having QPSK/OQPSK modulation and 7 W (38.5 dBm) output power\nat 8.2 GHz. This output power satisfies the link budget for a low earth orbit (LEO)\nsatellite at 700 km, utilizing required source-channel coding schemes in baseband\nfor a BER performance of 10?6. The modulation scheme of the transmitter can\nbe selected as BPSK, QPSK or OQPSK. In addition to QPSK/OQPSK modulation\nscheme choice, the transmitter will have three different data rates, 50 Mbps and\n100 Mbps which will be chosen according to the needs and facilities of the ground\nstation. As error correction coding (ECC) scheme, a nested structure that is recom-\nmended by CCSDS is chosen which combines powerful parts of the subcodes. As\nthe outer code, Reed Solomon with (255,223,33)256 is used for error correction for\nburst errors due to multipath fading. As inner code, a convolutional code with rate\n(1/2) is utilized, which provides correction for random errors in the channel with\na moderate bandwidth expansion. Between inner and outer codes, convolutional\ninterleaver with depth 5 is used.\n\n1 System Design of the Transmitter\n\nFor satellite applications, it is very important to have simple and reliable systems.\nFor this purpose, a simple heterodyne transmitter structure is chosen.

Transmitter system\nis composed of mainly three stages: Baseband, IF Stage and RF Stage.\n\n1.1 Baseband Stage\n\nIn the baseband stage of the transmitter (Fig. 1), the modulation scheme of the trans-\nmitter can be chosen as OQPSK or QPSK. In addition to the QPSK/OQPSK mod-\nulation scheme choice, the transmitter will have three different data rates, 50 Mbps,\nand 100 Mbps which will be chosen according to the needs and facilities of the\nground station, i.e., for mobile ground stations, it is possible to download the signal\nat low data rates with a small antenna. With 100 Mbps a state of the art technology\nwill be demonstrated and the demand for high data rates will be satisfied.\n\nAppropriate nested-interleaving and scrambling techniques are used to minimize\nDC component of the signal, to improve the timing recovery at receiver; and hence\neffectively making the bursty channel appear like a random error channel to the\ndecoder. As error correction coding (ECC) scheme, a nested structure is chosen\nwhich combines powerful parts of the subcodes. As the outer code, Reed Solomon\nwith (255,223,33)256 is used for error correction for burst errors due to multipath\nfading [12]. As inner code, a convolutional code with rate ( 12 ) is utilized, which\nprovides correction for random errors in the channel with a moderate bandwidth\nexpansion. Between inner and outer codes, convolutional interleaver with depth 5 is\nused. This concatenated encoder structure is also recommended by CCSDS [1].\n\nThen, the output is pulse shaped by an FIR-RRC (finite impulse response root\nraised cosine) filter, which is implemented digitally in Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA.

For reliability\nagainst Single Event Upset logic errors in FPGA configuration, Xilinx \u201cReadback\u201d\nCapability is used. For the necessity of reconfiguration, a CRC checksum, based\nupon all the configuration bits that have been read back, is generated and this CRC\nis compared with the expected checksum.\n\n1.2 The IF Stage\n\nAmp2210 MHzI/Q\nModulator\n\nI\nfrom DAC\n\nQ\nfrom DAC\n\n2210 MHz\nBPF\n\nAtt\n\nFig. 3 Block diagram of the IF stage\n\n\n\n390 H.K. Sunay et al.\n\nThe signal is direct quadrature modulated at 2210 MHz as the IF stage (Fig. 3)\nThen, it is filtered and amplified properly in order to obtain the required signal level.\n\nIn Fig. 4, EVM for 20 Mbps QPSK signal at 2210 MHz centre frequency is given.\nAdditionally in Fig. 5, EVM for 20 Mbps OQPSK signal at 2210 MHz centre fre-\nquency is given.\n\nFig. 4 EVM for 20 Mbps\nQPSK signal at 2210 MHz\n\nFig. 5 EVM for 20 Mbps\nOQPSK signal at 2210 MHz\n\n1.3 The RF Stage and the Power Amplifier\n\nRF stage includes bandpass filter and three stage (including one driver stage) power\namplifier that works at 8.2 GHz (Fig. 6). The analog signal at 2210 MHz is upcon-\nverted to 8.2 GHz, operating center frequency, with the help of a phase locked source\noscillating at 5990 MHz. Then required attenuation and filtering operations are ac-\ncomplished, taking related current, voltage and impedance matching conditions.\n\nOne of the main parts of RF stage is designed as a solid state power amplifier.\nIt has 7 W (38.5 dBm) output power with a gain of 20.5\u00b10.6 dB in 8.17\u20138.265 GHz\nbandwidth at 8.2 GHz centre frequency and overall efficiency of 26%. The first stage\nof the power amplifier is realized as a Class AB amplifier with an output power\nof 30 dBm and an efficiency of 22%. The second stage is also realised as class\n\n\n\nHigh Data Rate X-Band Transmitter for Low Earth Orbit Satellites 391\n\nAB amplifier with 38.5 dBm output and 37% efficiency. Drain current decreases\nwith the decrease in the input power so that efficiency degradation in the low input\npower is limited. This concept is very important since it increases efficiency without\nsacrifying linearity for the modulations with high peak to average ratio.\n\nOutput\nMatcing\n\nFLM7785-12FFLM7785-4F\nInput\n\nMatching\nOutput\n\nMatching\n\nr\n\nInput\nMatching\n\n8200 MHz\n\nPower\nAmplifier\n\n3dB Att\n\nPLO\n\n2210 MHz\nBPF\n\nDriver\nAmp Isolator\n\nFig. 6 Block diagram of the RF stage\n\nFigure 7, gives EVM results of the RF stage when target power output (38.5 dBm)\nis reached with 20 Mbps QPSK signal. When we compare the EVM results of the\nIF and the RF stages\u2019 we can see that EVM results of the RF stage are slightly\nincreased quantities. That difference arises because of nonlinearities in the line-up\n(mainly from that of PA stages). Nonlinearities of PA stages are different on different\nmodulation schemes depending on CCDF of the signal (effected by both modulation\nand ?), operating point of the PA, 1 dB comperssion point of PA and maximum\noutput power of PA. For our operating point with ? = 0.65 (same as QPSK case),\nthe EVM of OQPSK modulated 20 Mbps data rate signal is given in Fig. 8. As can\nbe seen from these results for the conditions at 38.5 output power, EVM results of\nOQPSK signal is slightly better.\n\nFig. 7 EVM for 20 Mbps\nQPSK signal at 8200 MHz\n\nSecond stage of PA used in this system is characterized by power added efficiency\n(PAE), gain and output power curves and the results are given in Fig. 9. As can be\nseen from these curves, at 38.5 dBm output, power added efficiency is 38% and PA\nis only 0.2 dB compressed. When both two stages of PA are considered, the results\nare in Fig. 10.\n\nFigure 11 Gives output of whole system when target power output (38.5 dbm) is\nreached with 100 Mbps QPSK signal. this spectrum also satisfies general linearity\n\n\n\n392 H.K.

Transmitter blocks consist of\nmainly commercial of the shelf components. Baseband is implemented digitally on\nXilinx Virtex-II FPGA for speed-up considerations. Solid state amplifier makes the\nsystem small in volume and light.\n\nRealization of X-band transmitter system is completed. This transmitter planned\nto be utilized in the LEO satellite named RASAT which will be launched at 2008\nby TU?BI?TAK-Space Technologies Institute. RASAT will be a Earth Observation\nsatellite with 8 m resolution RGB camera.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Morelos-Zaragoza Robert H., The Art of Error Correcting Coding, John Wiley & Sons, 2002\n\n\n\nFlowing Taks: Scalable Software Dependability\nand Performance\n\nSergio Montenegro and Raffaele Vitulli\n\nAbstract Dependability is a major challenge when designing space computing sys-\ntems, both at software and hardware level. After 30 years of contentious research on\nhow to achieve high dependability, not a single solution has been found. A huge\neffort has been invested to improve reliability, using reliable radiation hardened\ncomponents. However, failures cannot be eliminated totally.\n\nNowadays, it is not imaginable the use of the same (general purpose) computer\nin a cube sat (10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 cm3, 1 Kilogram) and in a mini satellite. For each\nsatellite, a special purpose computer configuration need to be assembled, consist-\ning of board computer, payload for cameras, star tracker, power control, reaction\nwheels, etc.\n\n1 Conceptual Obstacles\n\nFrom our experience we can identify at least 4 important very common conceptual\nobstacles when designing a fault tolerant system.\n\n1) Any digital control system is a team work of software and hardware. Trying\nto solve any problem or challenge using only one of them means to loosing a\nlot of possibilities, like a team (Software-Hardware) where one player in soft-\nware, but very few try to face the challenge in a team work of software and\nhardware.\n\n2) Another wrong assumption is to think that to provide fault tolerance you just\nhave to replicate resources. For example if you can control a water tank level\nopening and closing a valve, like in Fig. 1.\n\nS. Montenegro\nDLR, Institute of Space Systems, Am Fallturm 1, 28359 Bremen, Germany\ne-mail: sergio.montenegro@dlr.de\n\nR. Vitulli\nESA/ESTEC, Keplerlaan 1, 2201AZ Noordwijk, The Netherlands\n\nR. Sandau et al. (eds.), Small Satellites for Earth Observation, 395\nC\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008\n\n\n\n396 S. Montenegro, R. Vitulli\n\nFig. 1 Replication alone is\nnot fault tolerance\n\nThen you may think: The valve can fail; let\u2019s add another valve (Fig. 1). Now\none of the redundant valves fails in open position, you can not control the tank\nany longer. What you got is a higher possibility of failure and not more depend-\nability. This was not right the solution!\n\n3) Another wrong assumption is to think you can reach an absolute failure free\nsystem. Then an enormous effort is invested to reach what you can not reach.\nSee Fig. 1. You can do what you want, but any system will crash some day.\n\nFig. 2 Infinite effort to reach a total fault free system\n\n4) Another important consideration is what to do after so many resources are per-\nmanently damaged, that no normal operation is possible any longer.\n\n\n\nFlowing Taks: Scalable Software Dependability and Performance 397\n\n2 A Non Conventional Way to Dependability\n\nLet\u2019s consider (in this paper) 4 (from 0 to 3) stages of fault tolerance:\n\n0: No fault tolerance. One failure is enough to cause a system failure or system\ncrash\n\n1: Any single failure can collapse some critical functions, but the system remains\nin a safe operation. (Gracefully degradation)\n\n2: Like 1, but after a short time period the system can reconfigure itself to go back\nto normal operation (resilience)\n\n3: No single failure can disturb the normal operation of the system.\n\nStage 3 sounds very nice, but it requires at least a 3 fold replication of (almost) all\nresources, including volume, mass, power consumption, heat production, etc. For\nsome space applications this can be a prohibitive condition. Furthermore after the\nfirst permanent failure, the system will go down to stage 2 or 1. For long operations\nwhere permanent failures are expected, stage 3 will be possible only at the beginning\nof the mission.\n\nIt is therefore advisable to create a resources economical system which provides\nstage 2 for the whole mission even after several failures. Our target is to get the\nhighest possible dependability using very limited resources. The system has to be\noperable always in a safe way, but temporally loose of advanced features is al-\nlowed. Thereby it was very important not to do again the common mistakes listed in\nchapter 1.\n\n2.1 Step 1: Let it Crash!\n\nA realistic node computer operation can be represented like in Fig. 3.\n\nFig. 3 realistic node computer operation\n\nAfter start up a node computer will work properly for a time period (may be years)\nbut some day it will crash and no one can impede this. Better than trying to create a\n(sub)system which shall never fail or where a failure is an extraordinary exception,\nwe count with failures, they are not exceptions, but expected events which will be\nhandles smoothly. The paradox situation is: to be safe, be ready to crash at any time.\n\n\n\n398 S. Montenegro, R. Vitulli\n\nTo increase the dependability of the system we can increase the reliability of each\nnode (eg. mean time to failure MFTF) and reducing the recovery time after crashes\n(increasing Availability).\n\nMuch more important than try to avoid crashes (we can not) it to provide an\nultra fast recovery. Recovery includes reboot, restore context of applications and\nupdate the context to the current situation. Having a very short recovery time, we can\ntolerate very easily multiple node crashes, and if we use some kind of redundancy,\nthe probability of two redundant nodes to be down at the same time becomes lower.\nSee Fig. 4.\n\nFig. 4 Increasing dependability\n\nToday the recovery time is very long, depending on the operating system it can\nrange from 10 seconds to some minutes. This long period increase the probability\nof a total system failure if redundant nodes are down at the same time (see Fig. 4).\nOr target is to have a recovery time of a few milliseconds. If so, we can tolerate\nseveral crashes per second without problems.\n\n2.2 Step 2: Do Not Paddle Only on One Side, Use Both: Software\nand Hardware\n\nBetter than trying to have fault tolerance in Hardware and to make it transparent to\nthe software (e.g. Maxwell approach), we implements robustness as a harmonized\nteam work of software and hardware. If you have a legacy or extreme complex\nsoftware, which you cannot modify (or even understand) then you have to make fault\ntolerance transparent to the software, but doing so you lose an enormous potential\nfrom HW-SW team work: Hardware provides redundancy and software provides an\nintelligent redundancy management.\n\n\n\nFlowing Taks: Scalable Software Dependability and Performance 399\n\nUsing an intelligent dynamic redundancy management it is possible to adapt the\nredundancy degree to the current situation and mission phase. The resources usage\ncan vary to provide high performance (no/low redundancy) or high dependability\n(high redundancy).\n\n3 Our Approach/Our Solutions\n\nContrary to most other approaches who try to minimise the possibility of failures,\nthis approach considers that failures will occur and tries to handle them efficiently.\nDependability is implemented using smart and efficient resource and redundancy\nmanagement. The novel approach is to focus on efficient software solution instead\non adding more hardware.\n\nWe aim an artificial brain computing model which controls the whole spacecraft.\nIt consists of a network of computing nodes capable of executing different tasks\nand autonomous task re-distribution. The brain metaphor implies capability of self\norganisation and adaptability. If some nodes fail, their tasks will be automatically\nmoved to other working nodes (imitating the brain feature of healthy cells being\ncapable of overtaking the functions of damaged or decease-affected cells). This\nsimplifies the spacecraft/satellite construction having only one computer with au-\ntonomous configuration and continuity of service.\n\nOn the Hardware side our approach is based on a network of computing nodes\n(more than 3). On the software side our Approach is based on the BOSS operating\nsystem (Originally: Bird Operating System) which was designed to support depend-\nability. Two major objectives are the ultra fast task recovery and ultra fast task migra-\ntion mechanisms. An application with multiple tasks running on BOSS is distributed\nover a set of node computers. The communication between tasks is performed using\nnamed ports with a producer/subscriber protocol. The number of tasks, ports and\nthe topology are transparent to the application. This allows redistribution of tasks\nwithout any programmer intervention. Consequently, any task can be replicated for\nredundancy purposes making the running system highly reconfigurable.\n\nDependably is based on a team work of software and undependable and inex-\npensive hardware. The designer assumption is that a node computer may crash each\nsecond. No other approach can handle such an extreme high crash ratio. This is an\nenormous advantage for example for satellites which operate in environments with\nvery high radioactivity and electromagnetic noise. This approach is ready to handle\ncrashes at any time.\n\n4 BOSS Kernel and Middleware\n\nThe BOSS real time kernel and middleware offer an integrated framework (OO)\ninterface. There is no need to differentiate what is a RT kernel and what is middle-\nware functionality. Both together will be called the BOSS-framework. The BOSS\n\n\n\n400 S. Montenegro, R. Vitulli\n\nframework aims to offer the most simple and small possible interface to users tasks,\nwhich still provides all required functionality and flexibility.\n\nThe BOSS-framework includes time management, resource management and\ncommunication functionality. Without an application the framework is inactive, it\njust reacts to interrupts doing nothing. An application can add actions to the BOSS-\nframework by inheriting classes and creating active objects. These objects will be\nintegrated automatically in the framework. In this way the framework will be ex-\ntended with user functionality.\n\n4.1 Communicating Tasks\n\nLet\u2019s take as example a task network to control 3 arms using an environment model.\nThe task distribution is shown in Fig. 5.\n\nFig. 5 Hypothetical Example of Task Distribution\n\nFor the implementation there is no difference where the tasks will be deployed. The\nposition of tasks can even change at run time, without requiring any explicit reaction\nof the other involved tasks. Task communicate using the BOSS Middleware, but its\nonly interface are messages, the rest is transparent. Tasks just define input and output\nmessages. The rest is some one else job (Middleware and real time kernel).\n\n4.2 Structure of the BOSS Framework\n\nA BOSS controller is implemented as a collection of building blocks on the top of\na middleware, which creates a virtual totally interconnection network for all tasks\n\n\n\nFlowing Taks: Scalable Software Dependability and Performance 401\n\nrunning on it. The middleware allows every task to communicate with any other task\nindependent of their position. It imposes no limitations to communication paths,\nbut the application shall use/create a meaningful, reasonable and efficient inter-task\ncommunication structure.\n\nThere may be different system configurations for BOSS applications. The system\nsupports to migrate from any of these configurations to another without having to\nchange the application. This will be achieved by implementing a layered system.\n\nThe application tasks run on the top of a virtual global middleware which cross\nnode boundaries and interconnect all threads/tasks in the system. They do not need\nto know the details of lowered layers. Applications can interact without having to\nknow about locations and hardware architectures.\n\nThe global middleware is implemented on local middleware running on each\nnode. This local middleware runs on the top of a real time kernel or operating system\nwhich administrates the time and local resources in the node. The real time kernel\nis implemented using a virtual hardware abstraction, which is implemented by the\nhardware dependent layer. To move from any hardware platform to another one,\nonly this small layer has to be re-implemented.\n\nReferences\n\n1. P.A.
