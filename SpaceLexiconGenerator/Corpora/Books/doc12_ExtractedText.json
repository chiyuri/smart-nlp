The construction of an international gas pipeline, \nthe development and commercial launch of a new type of aircraft for transporting \npassengers, the building of the tunnel under the English Channel between France and \nEngland, the planning and building of a nuclear power plant, the on-ground manufac-\nturing of the components of the International Space Station and their launch and \nassembly in space are all examples of major programs. \n\n All of these achievements were made possible through enormous investments in \nresearch and development and major industrial programs that have very distinct fea-\ntures: major  fi nancial investment and long-term time commitment, cutting edge innova-\ntion, international partnerships, and ever-increasing levels of technological risk. \n\n Space programs, by their very nature, are part of the scienti fi c and industrial activi-\nties we have just illustrated. \n\n Space programs therefore require huge investments and it falls upon governments, \nthrough their space programs, to provide the funding for their realization. Private \nbusinesses can only begin to invest in space systems when an application from a \nspace program becomes commonly used and is valuable to a large market. \n\n This particular feature of the space sector, in addition to creating a barrier to compe-\ntition, requires public investors to be fully aware of their country\u2019s scienti fi c and indus-\ntrial strategies and to synthesize these scienti fi c, industrial, and political aspects. \n\n These considerations are even more important in international cooperation, where \nnational interests must co-exist with compromises resulting from political negotia-\ntions, which prevail over technological or scienti fi c issues. \n\n The decision-making process involved in a space program is therefore complex \nand varied: the national space agency plays a crucial role in protecting and enhancing \nboth previous as well as future national investments. \n\n Once it has been decided to start up a space program, proper management becomes \ncrucial and can be summarized in two key factors: cost management and time \nmanagement. \n\n The essence of management therefore lies in the ability to plan, control, and inter-\nvene in the development of the project to maintain time schedules and costs estab-\nlished at the program\u2019s start-up. \n\n This capability involves two things: from the industrial viewpoint, it is the capabil-\nity of managing production properly (in accordance with the time schedule and costs \nestablished in the contract), and from the agency\u2019s viewpoint, as the capability of \nknowing how to invest through proper planning. \n\n If the  fi rst aspect is easily identi fi able (industrial management), the second one is \nnot so easy to recognize, but has an enormous impact on program management. \n\n\n\nviii Foreword\n\n It involves the agency\u2019s ability to plan and invest in time schedules and proper \nmodalities, which are consistent with national and international strategies and which \ndo not impede or anticipate scienti fi c or industrial activities that could cause imbal-\nances in public expenditures. \n\n These imbalances can generate surpluses or liabilities that affect the agency\u2019s \nmanagement, which has the responsibility of investing in long-term and highly stra-\ntegic programs. \n\n Here is where space program management not only involves proper management \nmethods and tools, but also  governance  of the space sector for planning and strategic \nguidance of public investment. \n\n Based on these brief considerations, the space sector is unique and the manage-\nment of space programs is a very complex task. In the past, the sector\u2019s decision-\nmaking and management processes were a reference model for other industrial \nsectors because of their distinctive technological and development nature. \n\n The methods and tools dealt with in this book aim at drawing the reader closer to \nthe speci fi c nature of this sector. It illustrates how the conception, management, \n fi nancing, and start-up of a space program are among the most complex of human \nactivities and how space history has in fl uenced today\u2019s programs. \n\n It is an area where highly quali fi ed, specialized men and women are an essential \nand crucial prerequisite. \n\nPresident of the Italian Space Agency ASI  Enrico Saggese     \n\n\n\nix\n\n   Preface   \n\n I had the privilege of returning, to the International Space Station (ISS) for the third \ntime from 16 May to 1 June 2011 after the \u201cMarco Polo\u201d mission in 2002 and the \n\u201cEneide\u201d mission in 2005. This time I did not go with the Russian Soyuz spacecraft, \nbut I  fl ew on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which took off from the hot, sunny \nCape Canaveral launch base in Florida. \n\n I spent 16 incredible days on board the Endeavour and the ISS, experiencing \nevents and surroundings I had known years before, which were always new, fascinat-\ning, and captivating. \n\n Sixteen work days that were the result of years and years of work, training, and \ntesting; in other words planning and preparation. \n\n This is why reading and writing a preface for a book which concerns space pro-\ngrams, after experiencing them  fi rst-hand, evokes a strange feeling in me. \n\n After having experienced a certain kind of training for many years, made up of \nmethodically planned intense activity and having spent many days on board the ISS, \nI am now reading behind-the-scenes activities and methods with a mixture of curios-\nity, interest, and re fl ection. \n\n Space, as a sector, is continuously evolving and becoming a work environment \nopen to everyone. It provides    an opportunity for growth and development; however, \nthe absolute methodological and management rigor that has always characterized it \nhas remained a constant. \n\n During incredible days of intense activity inside the ISS in orbit at a speed of \n28,000 km/h around our planet, you are not aware of all the work that has gone into \nthose times. However, you only have to re fl ect for an instant to understand how much \nof what only a few people have the privilege of experiencing is the result of the work \nof thousands of men and women who for years have planned, realized, and managed \na network of programs and projects to make the largest house in space. \n\n The subject of space program management, especially where the human factor \n fi gures, is therefore so complex and varied that even an astronaut (the very person \nwho incarnates the essence of the reason men and women design spacecraft or orbit-\ning stations) is unaware of the whole picture. \n\n This is why reading a book which examines several of the vital mechanisms of the \nthree sides of \u201ctechnological-management- fi nancial development\u201d helps us to better \nunderstand how this fascinating and complex world works, a world where a few \nhundred space objects in orbit around the Earth help us every day to understand the \nclimate, to communicate with each other, to locate, and help us to live in space to \nexplore and experiment new ways of propelling human life beyond the frontiers of \nthe Earth itself. \n\n\n\nx Preface\n\n We now have the \u201cexperience\u201d of how to live in space, thanks to planning and \nmanagement logic that was completely unknown until a few decades ago. The induc-\ntive principle has become essential for extrapolating general rules from the individual \ncases of prior experiences in order to create standards of reference for new and inno-\nvative programs that drive man ever further into the universe. \n\n In this sense, I consider it a duty to thank the author of this book. He is a personal \nfriend of mine    whose clarity of thought and ability to analyze and synthesize have \ntranslated into the passion evident in this book. \n\n A passion, which is for us all and for the future generation of scientists, engineers, \nastronauts, and human beings in general, the source of curiosity and knowledge. \n\nPilot of the Italian Air Force  Roberto Vittori \n   Astronaut of the European Space Agency ESA   \n\n\n\nxi\n\n   Acknowledgments  \n\n    Mr. Mauro Balduccini wrote Chap.  \u2022  6    .  \n  Mr. Federico Nasini wrote Chap.  \u2022  7    .  \n  Mr. Richard Fleeter wrote    Chap.  \u2022  8    , and extensively revised the whole book.  \n  \u2022 Section 9.1 of    Chap.   9     has been extracted from the book \u201cThe Advanced \nCommunications Technology Satellite\u201d written by Richard Gedney, Ronald Schertler \nand Frank Gargione, published in 2000 by ScieTech Publishing Inc., NY.  \n  Mr. David J.

All we have to do is think of the great International Space Station to have \nimmediate con fi rmation of the feasibility and concreteness of a success that seems to \nreaf fi rm itself each day. \n\n Marcello Spagnulo   , the author of this book on space programs, offers to the reader \na complete overview of the factors which make up a space mission, an activity which, \njust like all great undertakings, has always been very complex, rich with challenges \nand risks, time schedules and considerable costs which are often very uncertain. \n\n The book richly details and expresses the speci fi c nature of the space sector start-\ning with an overview of these developments in various countries. It illustrates histori-\ncal developments at length and the outlook of the space market. In this way the author \nmore or less implicitly de fi nes the reasons for which man decided to propel himself \ninto space and the objectives of the space missions that were carried out. \n\n One chapter is dedicated to program management, an activity in which the author, \nbecause of his experience in his rich and varied career, has acquired his expertise \ndirectly. The description of management proposed in this book therefore enriches a \nsystematic description of this subject with the vision of experience. Program manage-\nment is the  fi rst of the major factors necessary for developing every great mission, \nespecially space programs. The book examines its essential aspects, dedicating great \ndetail to speci fi c areas, such as the management of con fi guration (of great importance \nalso in the related  fi eld of aeronautics) and the management of delays, an issue that \nis of strong current interest to all complex industrial programs. \n\n Space missions carry high levels of risk. The book pays particular attention in \ndetailing technical and  fi nancial \u201creliability and security\u201d issues and the insurance \nmarket for space programs. \n\n The management of costs and  fi nancial issues brings the book to a close with two \nchapters devoted to subjects which are usually ignored in space education courses, but \n\n\n\nxvi Introduction\n\nwhich are of increasing importance for future space programs. Cost is an increasingly \ncritical factor in missions and in the development, implementation, and management of \nspace systems. This criticality, linked to various factors but relevant both for space \nindustries funded by government agencies and for space companies working in the \nmarket, has transformed cost from a factor of program management to a factor in mis-\nsion planning. \n\n Paradoxically,  fi nancial issues will bring about more innovation. The future of \nmany space industries in the development phase will be linked to the ability to imple-\nment  fi nancing that involves public\u2013private types of partnership for developing and \nimplementing programs. \n\n It is a well-organized and complete book, and not dif fi cult to read, even for readers \nwho have not come across space issues during their university studies or professional \nexperience. \n\n This is an important feature for a book on space programs. In fact, in as much as \ntechnology and science certainly play a determining role for the implementation and \nsuccess of every space mission, space is not just a world of engineers and scientists. \nThe professions involved in each space program cover a very broad spectrum ranging \nfrom economics to management, legal issues to  fi nancial ones, political to military \nand security issues, and life sciences to medicine. \n\n Marcello Spagnulo\u2019s book    provides the world of users, who only encounter the \nspace world at a certain point of their career, with an instrument for understanding the \nworld of space programs and for an in-depth examination of the various issues. \n\n Because of its organization, complexity, and completeness, the book can also be \nused as a tool for an in-depth study of the themes examined to bene fi t technical \nexperts\u2014scientists and engineers\u2014who because of their involvement in a problem, \ncan sometimes lose sight of the overall picture when they encounter elements outside \nthe technological realm. \n\n Marcello Spagnulo\u2019s involvement in the educational community of the Master\u2019s \nprogram in satellites and orbiting platforms of the University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d \n(where he obtained his degree in Aeronautical Engineering) is related to his desire \nand effort to conceive and realize such a rich and complete book. \n\n During my teaching experience and in de fi ning the scope and didactic contents of \nthe Master\u2019s degree in satellites, I had the good fortune to meet many professionals, \nsuch as the author of this book, who wanted to pass on their experience to new gen-\nerations and to other professionals who wanted to update their professional abilities \nand enter the world of space. As is well known, the University of Rome \u201cla Sapienza\u201d \nwas the cradle of Italian space activities and it is perhaps for this reason that an opera-\ntional and application component has always been present in our cultural tradition \nalongside academics and research. \n\n Today this tradition allows us to develop research and development programs in \nvarious space venues in intense synergy with the world of space agencies, companies, \nand institutions that are involved in space in various ways. High-level training in \nspace systems and missions put the academic community in close contact with vari-\nous organizations that develop and operate space programs. \n\n\n\nxviiIntroduction\n\n For these courses, Marcello Spagnulo\u2019s book will be a precious tool in the years \nto come for the cultural and professional development of those who wish to become \ninvolved in space missions of the future. \n\n Paolo Gaudenzi \n Full Professor of \u201cAerospace systems and design\u201d at the University of Rome \u201cLa \n\nSapienza\u201d \n Director of the Master\u2019s program in Satellites and Orbiting Platforms and \n\nCoordinator of the Research Doctorate in Aeronautic and Space Technologies     \n\n\n\nwwwwwwww\n\n\n\nxix\n\n   Introduction by the Author   \n\n When    I published in 2011 the Italian version of this book I choose as cover a photo \nfrom NASA website which always has been in my mind as an icon. \n\n The image I\u2019m talking about was taken on 21 July 1969 from the porthole of the \ncommand module \u201cColumbia\u201d of Apollo 11. It shows the lunar module \u201cEagle\u201d which \nstands out from the surface of the moon after having landed on it only 24 h earlier. On \nboard the lunar module are the  fi rst of two human beings who landed on a celestial body \noutside of Earth for the  fi rst time in history. And in the dark background of the photo, \njust behind the lunar module, a bright tiny Earth is suspended in space. \n\n The Apollo 11 mission   , through this iconic photo, represents, in my opinion, the \nmost striking image depicting a small machine built by man which travelled in a side-\nreal void from Moon to Earth. It signaled a high point, a peak that till today has not been \nscaled again by the scienti fi c and industrial community involved in the dif fi cult task of \nsending human beings or probes into orbit around the Earth or into deep space. \n\n But the entire Apollo program was a watershed. This was not only because of its \ntechnological, political, and scienti fi c success, but also because of its value as a con-\nceptual and project reference. \n\n In order to have a million pieces that made up the Apollo spacecraft function per-\nfectly 380,000 km away from Earth, the US space agency NASA, together with \nindustries and universities involved in the lunar program, conceived of rules and \nprocedures that have in fl uenced project and management modalities for all subse-\nquent space programs. \n\n This is why a book which attempts to illustrate several general management prin-\nciples of space program management cannot help but give due credit to this human \nmission which continues to leave its mark on activities that see men and women in \nEurope, as well as in the USA, Russia, Japan, India, China, Canada, and other coun-\ntries still involved in the planning and building of satellites and spacecraft. \n\n But there is an even more personal reason for having chosen this photo as a sym-\nbolic icon. \n\n For every engineer, who like myself, studies the basics of Astrodynamics to learn \nhow to face the fascinating intellectual and technological challenges of our profes-\nsion, one of the basic texts was the book \u201cFundamentals of Astrodynamics\u201d written \nin 1971 by three professors, Roger Bate, Donald Mueller, and Jerry White, who \nworked in the Department of Astronautics of the US Air Force Academy. \n\n This book had that same photo on its cover. \n I had a copy of the book in    1981 by an engineer at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Center, \n\nwhom I will never cease to thank for his part in helping me understand our world a \nlittle better. \n\n Rome, January 25th 2011    Marcello Spagnulo     \n\n\n\nwwwwwwww\n\n\n\nxxi\n\n  List of the Authors    (and Contributors) \n\n          Marcello   Spagnulo                  \n\n     Rick   Fleeter                \n\nMauro   Balduccini                \n\n     Federico   Nasini                \n\n     David   J.

Space relatively near the Earth\u2019s \nsurface, between 12,000 m altitude from Earth, has become a polluted area of traf fi c \nand life because of the increase in air transport. Only a few hundred men and women \nhave crossed outer space, beyond 100 km, in the last 50 years. \n\n The mechanical wings on which these men and women have  fl own outside the \nEarth\u2019s atmosphere are called space launchers. They are sophisticated missiles with \ncapsules and passenger compartments on board which protect human beings from \ndeadly extra-atmospheric conditions. \n\n The history of missiles in the last 50 years of the twentieth century therefore coin-\ncides with the history of the development of human space programs\u2014astronautics. \n\n Because of space\u2019s lethal conditions outside the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, man has \nplanned and sent robots into space. These probes or satellites have electronic equip-\nment that can receive and transmit data, take photos while  fl ying around the Earth, or \nthat can land, for example, on Mars, or travel to deeper space. \n\n Therefore, we cannot really say that we have  fi nally \u201cconquered\u201d space, a term \nthat in our opinion is often used incorrectly to emphasize the truly important achieve-\nments of man,  fi lled with fascination due to their complexity and to the prevailing \nunknown. \n\n Truthfully, the strategic and military implications of human activity in space, both \nwith astronauts and satellite or probe launch, were quickly understood and utilized by \nthe military institutions of the most powerful countries on Earth, particularly by the \ntwo that were to become the winners of the Second World War, the USA and the \nformer Soviet Union, the USSR. \n\n A history of space missiles and astronautics must review the scienti fi c and indus-\ntrial events of these two countries. \n\n However, ever since the 1970s, other countries including Europe have slowly \nundertaken space activities with greater strength and ef fi ciency. The evolution of this \nsector is constantly changing because emerging continents, China and India  fi rst, \nhave now developed industrial capability in several cases superior to Europe. \n\n Today a real governance of space has developed. It is a collection of organizations \nand rules that have been created by industrialized nations to develop and manage \nspace programs. \n\n\n\n2 Space Program Management\n\n Of course, each nation has developed and is developing according to historical and \npolitical advancements, its own space governance .  The challenges of the future are \nalso being met with more global instruments, though critical and dif fi cult to achieve, \nin order to have governance evolve in this sector. \n\n    1.1.   Brief History of the First Space Age \n\n The  fi rst space programs were begun at the end of the Second World War in rocket \nscience and were conducted by the two winning powers, the USA and Russia, who \nappropriated German scientists and their technological knowledge. \n\n The Germans had started up important technological developments during the war \nin rocket science to the point where they built missiles, the V-2, which could reach \n80 km in altitude at a speed of over 5,000 km/h, for all purposes the  fi rst missiles built \nby man that could reach outer space. \n\n The Russians began their space journey with military programs and objectives and \nworked without revealing the progress of their developments. \n\n The USA  fi rst had small, rather con fl icting programs because of the rivalry \nbetween various branches of the armed forces that had understood the potential for \nthe use of space from the beginning. However, their work, which from the very begin-\nning had a public nature that was ostensibly scienti fi c, carried out openly, and so its \nadvancement was easier to follow. \n\n The initial public objectives of the space programs were linked to Earth science \nand the exploration of the upper atmosphere. In preparation for the \u201cInternational \nGeophysics Year\u201d in 1957, the USA announced its \u201cVanguard\u201d project for launching \nsmall capsules containing special electronic devices for measuring the physical phe-\nnomena of the upper atmosphere into space using missiles. The mission\u2019s objective \nwas to have the capsules orbit around the Earth, creating small satellites like the \nMoon, although arti fi cial ones. \n\n The Russians made the same announcement and amazed the world when they \n succeeded in putting into orbit the  fi rst arti fi cial satellite, the Sputnik 1 with an R-7 \nrocket launched from the Baikonur space base in Kazakhstan on 4 October 1957 \nbefore the USA. \n\n It was only on 31 January 1958 after the dramatic failure of the Vanguard launcher \nthat the Americans succeeded in the  fi rst launch of the Jupiter missile designed by \nGerman Werner Von Braun, who had been the head of the V-2 program during the \nwar. \n\n Thus began a series of satellite launches that became more and more technically \ncomplex between the two world powers. \n\n It was also the Russians who overcame the Earth\u2019s orbit: on 2 January 1959, Lunik \n1 almost touched the Moon, and then on 12 September 1959 Lunik 2 fell directly on the \nMoon\u2019s surface. Finally, on 4 October 1959 Lunik 3 went on an orbit that circled the \nMoon and took photos of its hidden side that had been unknown to man until then. \n\n There were numerous satellite launches. The most memorable include Pioneer V \nlaunched in solar orbit and the Sputnik V, which put two dogs into orbit who were \nrecovered alive on ground, then the Venusik that  fl ew 100,000 km over Venus. \n\n\n\n3\n\n  Figure 1.1.     Yuri Gagarin\u2019s takeoff from Baikonur on 12 April 1961. (Roscomos RKA web site \nsource).       \n\nSpace Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\n It was then man\u2019s turn into space and on 12 April 1961 Russian cosmonaut Yuri \nGagarin was the  fi rst man in space with the Vostok I capsule, placed atop the \nSemiorka launcher built by the father of Russian astronaut Serghej Korolev. Gagarin\u2019s \nundertaking was brief but intense. After an orbit of 108 min around the Earth, he \nreturned unharmed (   Figure  1.1 ). \n\n On 6 August, German Titov, on board the Vostok II, made 17 orbits in about 25 h. \n Russia\u2019s space success brought about a radical change in the USA\u2019s way of think-\n\ning and attitude because it became a matter of national pride and because it became \nimperative to recover lost time from a military and scienti fi c point of view. \n\n The frenetic race to develop launchers became intense and when the Redstone \nmissile and the Mercury habitable modules were ready, the USA sent their  fi rst men \ninto space, the \u201cMagni fi cent Seven\u201d who were de fi ned as astronauts drawn from the \nranks of test and military pilots. \n\n On 5 May 1961, Alan Shepard made a suborbital  fl ight followed by John Glenn \non 20 February 1961 with the  fi rst real orbital  fl ight, followed by Scott Carpenter on \n24 May of the same year, and so on, all the others. \n\n However, it was the Russians who once again accomplished a space \u201c fi rst\u201d in \nAugust 1962, launching a large capsule with astronaut Nikolaiev on board and after \n2 h a second one with astronaut Popovic. The two capsules traveled for 3 days at a \nminimum distance of 5 km and had radio contact. These astronauts returned to Earth \nsafe and sound after having spent over 4 days in space. \n\n The President of the USA, John F. Kennedy, in his 1961 State of the Union address \nannounced that the Americans would start a space program for having man land on \nthe Moon by the end of the 1960s and to have him reenter safe and sound to Earth. \n\n \n\n\n\n4 Space Program Management\n\n The enormous technological and industrial effort of the Americans focused itself \nfrom that moment on the Moon mission. \n\n The decision to direct all of its efforts to the lunar space program was taken by the \nUSA when it was under shock from Soviet space supremacy and was undergoing \nserious military crises such as Cuba and Vietnam. \n\n Thus, the Americans wanted to recover their prestige as the absolute  fi rst world \npower in the public\u2019s opinion and therefore aimed at the Apollo Moon program to \nreposition themselves politically and strategically with the Russians to increase the \nnationalistic spirit of its citizens with a new American dream (Figure  1.2 ). \n\n In 1964, the Russian capsule Voskhod I guided by Colonel Vladimir Komarov and \nwith K. Feoktistov and medical doctor Boris Yegorov was successfully launched. \nVoskhod I was followed by Voskhod II, launched on 18 March 1965 and on 24 \nMarch, the Americans launched their  fi rst guided two-seat spacecraft, the Gemini, \nwith Virgil Grissom and John Young on board. Its objective was to clear the way for \nexploring the Moon. \n\n The Titan II launcher had to be developed. It was much more powerful than the \nRedstone and allowed the USA to  fl y the Gemini capsule. \n\n On the American side, nine other Gemini program  fl ights followed to acquire bet-\nter knowledge on the \u201crendezvous\u201d maneuvers to be done in space on much more \ndif fi cult missions such as those of the future Apollo spacecraft. \n\n The series of  fl ights of the Gemini program ended in November 1966, while Von \nBraun and his team at the NASA center in Huntsville, Alabama completed the building \n\n  Figure 1.2.

(NASA source).       \n\nSpace Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\nof the giant Saturn launcher with the objective of reaching the Moon with the Apollo \nspacecraft. \n\n World public opinion was informed, often in a spectacular fashion, only of civil \nspace missions and especially of the probes sent to the Moon, Mars, and Venus, both \nby Russians and Americans. \n\n Then the Apollo space program entered into the heart of their successes between \nthe end of 1968 and the middle of 1969, with the  fl ights of Apollo 7 and Apollo 10. \nThe most important testing for preparing the Moon landing which occurred on 20 \nJuly 1969 with the Apollo 11 mission was completed with  fl ying colors. \n\n The whole world followed the Moon landing phases on live television broadcast \nwhen Neil Armstrong cautiously put his foot on Moon soil saying these words: \n\u201cThat\u2019s one small step for man, but one giant step for mankind.\u201d \n\n Armstrong was accompanied by Edwin Aldrin who landed on the Moon with him \non board the LEM spacecraft, while Michael Collins remained in the Apollo capsule \nin lunar orbit (Figure  1.3 ). \n\n One after another, the Moon landings followed at approximately two per year until \nNASA decided to stop the Apollo missions in 1972 because of budgetary reasons and \nprogressive disinterest by the public for these types of missions. In total, nine \nAmerican missions toward the Moon were carried out with 24 astronauts, the only \nones to have left the Earth\u2019s orbit until today. Only 12 out of these 24 astronauts \nlanded on the Moon. \n\n The Apollo 13 mission aroused strong emotions because it almost risked turning \ninto tragedy when halfway between the Earth and the Moon an explosion on the \nspacecraft drastically cut off the available oxygen and energy. The LEM lunar landing \nmodule was used as a lifeboat and its motor worked to bring the worn-out crew back \nfrom an odyssey whose reality surpassed science  fi ction  fi lms. \n\n During the 1970s, the Russians and Americans cooperated in space missions on \nboard their respective orbiting stations around the Earth, the Mir and the Skylab, but \n\n \n\n\n\n6 Space Program Management\n\nthe most interesting space programs were not the ones with astronauts but those of \ninterplanetary probes that revealed the secrets of Jupiter, Saturn, and the most distant \nplanets. \n\n At the same time, space industry began to develop recurrence satellites for military \nand civil communication applications more often, especially for telephones and tele-\nvision, Earth observation, weather and monitoring, and so global industries, in the \nUSA, the Soviet Union, and Europe were set up to build larger and more ef fi cient \nsatellites. \n\n In 1969, the American company Bell Telephone Laboratories announced that they \nhad made the  fi rst telephone call via a man-made satellite. \n\n The satellite was named \u201cEcho\u201d and it was nothing more than a giant 30 m in \ndiameter sphere made of aluminum-covered plastic, in orbit at about 1,600 km alti-\ntude. On 12 August 1960, a signal sent from Goldstone, California, after bouncing off \nEcho\u2019s surface, was received by Bell Laboratories at Holmdel, New Jersey on the \nopposite coast of the USA. The signal, transmitted on microwave band, was a prere-\ncorded message by President Eisenhower. It was the  fi rst demonstration of the pos-\nsibility of radio communication on a global scale. \n\n However, the orbits such as Echo\u2019s were not suited to permanent communications, \nso the idea that appeared in 1945 in an article in the scienti fi c magazine \u201cWireless \nWorld\u201d made its way. The author, Arthur C. Clarke, demonstrated, without thinking \nin the least about the revolutionary implications of his thesis, that a satellite posi-\ntioned in equatorial circular orbit at an altitude of 35,786 km from Earth does a com-\nplete revolution every 24 h and an observer on the Earth\u2019s surface could always see \na geostationary satellite in the same position in the sky. \n\n Clarke also proved that a few satellites in geostationary orbit were enough to offer \ncommunications services to the entire world. \n\n Twenty years were to pass from the publication of this article before the  fi rst geo-\nstationary satellite for telecommunications (telephone services), Early Bird, was \nlaunched for Intelsat, the \u201cInternational Telecommunications Satellite Organization,\u201d \nin April 1965. \n\n From that date until today, hundreds of geostationary satellites that cover all the \ncontinents of the world have been put into orbit. \n\n In Europe, the European Space Agency, ESA, created in 1975, developed the OTS \nTelecommunication satellites that were later supplied to the Eutelsat organization \nbased in Paris (Intelsat on a European level), and the MeteoSat satellites for weather \nobservation that were also later transferred to a specially created European organiza-\ntion, EumetSat, for managing the  fl eet of satellites and related services. \n\n This growing industrial capability created another commercial sector, which by \nusing the spin-offs of military and scienti fi c use, introduced initiatives into the private \nbusiness market linked mostly to telephones and television. This market contributed \nto the growth of a launch services market, which are the sales of space transport ser-\nvices for satellites. \n\n Going back to the 1971\u20131981 decade, the Americans, after the Apollo space pro-\ngram, started up and realized the Space Shuttle program, which revolutionized the \nconcept of space transport, aiming at  fl ying an airplane-like spacecraft, which was \nalmost completely reusable. \n\n\n\n7\n\n  Figure 1.4.     8 July 2011: the Space Shuttle Atlantis takes off for the last mission of the space-\ncraft after 30 years. (NASA source).       \n\nSpace Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\n In 1981, the Shuttle successfully began its  fl ights, while the Russians \n progressively abandoned the development of spacecraft because of economic \nrestrictions due to the growing social-economic decline of the Soviet communist \nregime. At the end of the 1980s, the USA appeared to be the winner of the space \nrace, equipped with a Space Shuttle  fl eet that took off and landed from Cape \nKennedy, while Russia always used its launchers derived from its  fi rst missile \nSemiorka. Other nations, including European ones, began to open up with increas-\ning boldness to space launcher missions. \n\n However, the disasters of the Space Shuttle, the Challenger in 1986 and the \nColumbia in 2003, had a dramatic impact on American and international space activi-\nties since the Shuttle  fl ights depended on the still ongoing construction of the \nInternational Space Station (ISS) designed by NASA in cooperation with the \nEuropean, Japanese, Russian, and Canadian agencies (Figure  1.4 ). \n\n The ISS, conceived in the 1980s, began to be assembled in orbit in 1998 and the \n fi rst astronauts entered it on 2 November 2000. The ISS, today completed and inhab-\nited permanently by six astronauts, orbits at 360 km altitude and is reached by the \nSpace Shuttles and also be the Russian Soyuz, launched from Baikonur. \n\n The Columbia accident in 2003 further weakened faith in the Space Shuttle that \nwas terminated in 2011 with the STS-135 mission. Therefore the Russian Soyuz will \nbe the only transport for going into space while the world waits for a new American \nspacecraft. \n\n \n\n\n\n8 Space Program Management\n\n At the moment the ISS is the only large space infrastructure that is the result of an \ninternational cooperation. \n\n Even space missions for scienti fi c research have been a sector of great interna-\ntional cooperation. Initially in the 1960s and 1970s, the automatic probe scienti fi c \nmission was the exclusive prerogative of Russia and the USA, but in the 1980s even \nEurope, Japan, India, and China developed scienti fi c missions of outstanding interest \nand results. \n\n The planets of the Solar System were visited by many probes such as the Voyagers \nand the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, the result of an important cooperation between \nthe USA and Europe. Three American rovers have made long journeys to the planet \nMars\u2019 surface. ESA has sent a probe to the nucleus of Halley\u2019s Comet, created a \ncapsule that landed on Titan, a Saturn moon, and in 2009 put into orbit two satellites, \nHerschel and Planck, which are producing a vast array of data on the deep and \nunknown universe. \n\n The Hubble space telescope, put into orbit and repaired many times in space by \nthe Space Shuttle crews, has supplied outstanding images of the Milky Way and deep \nspace for almost 20 years. \n\n Thanks to satellites and space probes, the images of the planets, galaxies, and \nwonders of the cosmos have now become familiar in all school textbooks and popular \nmagazines.  \n\n    1.2.   Brief History of the Space Activities in Europe \n\n In the mid-1960s, the Soviet Union and the USA had already sent satellites and men \ninto space and were competing to conquer the Moon. \n\n The European countries were convinced that they had to develop their own space \nprogram, to consolidate the new and fragile European political entity whose self-\nimposed mandate at the end of the Second World War was to integrate its own indus-\ntrial and technological capabilities. It was also quite clear that no space program \ncould be conceived without a reliable launcher system and an operational space \nbase. \n\n In truth, in Europe the two winning powers of the Second World War, France and \nEngland, had already begun developing space launcher technology already beginning \nin the 1950s, but with a radically different approach. The English were supported \nfrom the beginning by American technologies to develop ballistic missiles, the \nBluestreak, capable of transporting atomic bombs which could at the same time be \ntransformed into space launchers. The English used the Woomera base in Australia \nfor operations and from the beginning of the 1960s had developed an advanced pro-\ngram for the management of launcher operations. England was in fact the fourth \nnation in the world to put a satellite into orbit, after Russia, the USA, and Italy. \n\n In 1964, Italy had built and launched a true technological jewel, the San Marco, \nfrom the American Wallops Island base. It then adapted a petroleum platform in \nKenya in 1967 for use as a launch base. Italy had begun the development of technolo-\ngies for building satellites, but it had not developed technologies in the launcher sec-\ntor since it was thought it was more economical and reliable to buy launches directly \nfrom the Americans instead of investing in developing them. \n\n\n\n9\n\n  Figure 1.5.     Past and future of the European Space Agency: from right to left the takeoff \nin 1979 of the  fi rst Ariane launcher, the satellite Olympus for telecommunica-\ntions, and, to the right, the future Galileo satellite. (ESA source).       \n\nSpace Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\n After a few years, toward the end of the 1960s, even the English decided like the \nItalians and determined politically it was more economical to rely on the launch of \nEnglish satellites to US launchers, instead of continuing to invest heavy sums on this \ntechnology. \n\n Instead, the French decided right from the beginning to aim at the development of \ntheir own launcher technologies. They even made rocket science one of their cardinal \npoints of their \u201cForce de Frappe\u201d policy, which was strongly favored by General De \nGaulle, president of the French republic. \n\n The \u201cForce de Frappe\u201d was France\u2019s autonomous capability to defend its own ter-\nritory and attack the outside with nuclear capability. In order to do so, it had to have \njet airplanes, ships, submarines, and missiles. It was a short step from missiles to \nspace launchers. \n\n President De Gaulle did not fail to notice the strong military value of space. In \n1961, he created the Centre National des Etudes Spatiales, CNES, which is to date \nthe national French agency for space activities. He called upon a general of aviation \nto head the agency. \n\n CNES focused on studying and developing satellites and \u201cDiamant\u201d launchers. \nThe \u201cDiamant\u201d was a three-stage launcher that successfully completed 10 out of 12 \nlaunches from 1965 to 1975 and allowed France to put 11 satellites into orbit. \n\n France became the  fi fth country in the world to launch a satellite into space, but \nwas the only one after Russia and the USA to have done it with its own technologies \nand not acquired ones, even partially, from overseas. \n\n When France created CNES, European community organizations undertook plans \nfor a common research in space programs, so in 2 years a restricted number of \nEuropean companies created two space agencies, ESRO,  \u201cEuropean Space Research \nOrganisation ,\u201d and ELDO \u201c European Launcher Development Organisation. \u201d \n\n ESRO was to promote the study of space by developing satellites, while ELDO, \ncreated in March 1962, was to concern itself with developing an autonomous launch \nsystem. \n\n The turning point was reached in 1975 with the creation of the ESA in which the \ntwo organizations, ELDO and ESRO, merged (Figure  1.5 ). \n\n \n\n\n\n10 Space Program Management\n\n An improved organization and the homogeneous use of resources brought the  fi rst \nencouraging results for launchers and satellites. Thus the Ariane programs for the \nlaunch vehicle, MeteoSat for meteorology, OTS for telecommunications, as well as a \ncertain number of scienti fi c probes were developed. The foundation for modern space \nmissions was cast.  \n\n    1.3.   Brief History of the Space Activities in the Rest of the World \n\n Space technology development in the 1960s and 1970s has also allowed the nations \nof China, India, and Japan to move into the world of high-rank space faring countries, \na place previously occupied only by the USA and Russia. \n\n India launched its  fi rst satellite Rohini 1 on July 1980 onboard a full indigenous \nSLV rocket from the Sriharikota Island launch site. In the following years, India con-\ncentrated its space effort on telecommunications and earth observation satellites as \nwell as on powerful rockets, becoming fully independent in all these technologies. \nAlso an Indian cosmonaut Rakesh Sharma spent 8 days in 1984 aboard the USSR\u2019s \nspace station Salyut 7, but for the time being a manned program is not going to be \nsoon developed. \n\n The China Space program has a well-known \u201cfather\u201d: Tsien Hsue-Shen, who stud-\nied at the MIT with rocket scientist Theodor Von Karman, then continued his studies \nat the CalTech,  fi nally contributing to found the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in \nPasadena. When the USA and China entered in the 1950s into a period of confronta-\ntion after the collapse of the US-backed regime of Chiang Kai-Shek and the victory \nof the Communist Party in China, Tsien Hsue-Shen became victim of the anticom-\nmunist policy within the USA, and was deported to China. There he was welcomed \nas a hero and immediately started the China\u2019s space program, making enormous \nadvances in the 1970s and 1980s. The  fi rst Chinese satellite was launched in the mid-\n1970s and in the 1990s China launched Asiasat-I, an advanced telecommunications \nsatellite comparable to the western made products. The CZ-2 launch vehicles class \nallowed the production of big and powerful rockets capable also of launching the \nmanned spacecraft Shenzou, which was  fi nally put in orbit in 1999. In 2003 the  fi rst \nChinese astronaut went into orbit onboard a Shenzou 5 spaceship atop of the enor-\nmous CZ-2F launcher, making the space manned program a reality. In 2011, the  fi rst \nmodules of the Chinese space station, expected to be completed by 2020, were \nlaunched successfully. \n\n The Japanese space program started in 1955 at the University of Tokyo, where the \nInstitute of Industrial Science began work with sounding rockets. In 1964 the Institute \nof Space and Aeronautical Science (ISAS) was founded at the University of Tokyo, \nbut in the 1960s all satellite launches failed. \n\n In 1969, the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) was \nestablished to take the lead in the development of space capabilities, including \nsatellites for remote sensing, meteorology, and telecommunications, as well as \nlaunch vehicles and facilities for producing and tracking the satellites. Also in \n1969, Japan and the USA signed an agreement allowing the transfer of unclassi fi ed \nspace technology from US  fi rms to Japan. The terms of the agreement prohibited \nreexporting of the technology by Japan, precluding effectively Japan from commercial \n\n\n\n11Space Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\nmarketing on the international market for launch services and communication \nsatellites. But at a  fi nal end the agreement permitted to Japan to develop system \ncapabilities for design and production of satellites and launchers. After this move \nin 1970, the  fi rst Japanese satellite was successfully launched into orbit. In 2003, \nISAS, National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan (NAL), and NASDA were merged \ninto one independent administrative institution: the Japan Aerospace Exploration \nAgency (JAXA). The consolidation of these three formerly independent organiza-\ntions allowed the synergy among the various space programs which since the 1960s \nthose entities were pursuing separately. In the 1990s and beginning of 2000, the \nJapanese space program underwent a crisis of con fi dence following a succession of \nsatellite and launcher failures. But since then the space program was deeply reor-\nganized, and a new renaissance took shape allowing great success in the scienti fi c \nprograms on the moon and on asteroids, as well as in the application satellites, \nlaunchers, and manned programs within the ISS framework. Also Japan launched \nin 2000s its  fi rst military/intelligence reconnaissance satellites becoming a true \nspace faring nation.  \n\n    1.4.   The \u201cGovernance\u201d of the Activities in Space \n\n By space \u201cgovernance,\u201d we mean the political, military, and economical decision-\nmaking factors that can in fl uence scienti fi c research and industrial development for \nspace activities in the framework of a nation. \n\n \u201cGovernance\u201d is therefore a guiding and management tool in space activities and \nis clearly the prerogative of those nations in the world that have developed those \ncapabilities, that is the USA, Russia, Europe, China, India, and Japan and in a very \nminor way, Israel and Brazil. \n\n Space, de fi ned as the exo-atmospheric environment near the Earth, is a strategic \nelement, but it is also of commercial interest. In countries that have developed indus-\ntrial capabilities of access and use of space, governance is therefore an instrument \naimed at political\u2013industrial objectives inside and outside the country. \n\n In space, satellites  fl y over the globe without territorial limits. Therefore, space \nactivities can be a signi fi cant instrument for enhancing a country\u2019s foreign policy. It \nis easy to see how the strategic aspect of space is intrinsically related to the concept \nof security and defense since militarily it represents the fourth level, after marine, \nground, and air, of the armed forces  fi eld of operations and its use for these purposes \nseem to be gaining increasing support. \n\n The militarization of space, which is the deployment in orbit of active offense \nsystems, does not yet exist, but we should not ignore the signs of progress in Chinese \ntechnology and obviously American technology in this  fi eld, for example, the inter-\nception and destruction of an orbiting satellite. \n\n Therefore, it is clear that in order for space activities to be effective they must be \ncomplete, affording the ability to make spacecraft, satellites or probes, and transport \nvehicles, such as launchers, to support the nation on a global political level. \nConsidering the two vehicles as separate space systems and not necessarily both \ndevelopable within a country or continent could be a serious political, strategic, and \neconomical error. \n\n\n\n12\n\nOthers\n7 %\n\nIndia\n1 %\n\nJapan\n5 %\n\nEurope\n12 %\n\nUSA\n75 %\n\n  Figure 1.6.     Geographic estimated distribution of expenses, civil and military, for the space \nsector in the world. (Finmeccanica SpA elaboration source).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n \u201cGovernance\u201d is basically of an internal and foreign political nature. It is managed \nto generate economic and industrial returns to justify the high government invest-\nments required and to guarantee only a part of self- fi nancing with commercial activi-\nties. Economic data of the last 20 years have shown that the commercial part of the \nsector is a form of complementary  fi nancing which only integrates and accompanies \ngovernmental funding in several application  fi elds. \n\n Nevertheless, autonomous and independent industrial capability in satellites and \nlaunchers is a very important element for a country or continent that aims at af fi rming \nitself politically and strategically on the international scene. \n\n To quantify world space governance, that is, the comparison of the  fi nance capa-\nbility of various nations, we can examine several signi fi cant numerical data. \n\n Figure  1.6  illustrates for example the estimation of the percentage of civilian and \nmilitary investment in the world for countries with space capabilities. We can infer \nthat the USA spends over 70% of what is invested globally in the sector, but we must \nalso consider that Russia, India, and China have an intrinsic \u201ctechnological value\u201d far \nsuperior to the  fi gures reported which come from not always of fi cial sources. \n\n According to estimates of Euroconsult in 2010, world public spending was around \n72 billion dollars, of which 12 billion dollars for human space fl ight, 8.4 billion dol-\nlars for telecommunications, 8 billion for Earth observation, 6 billion for space sci-\nence, 5 billion for launchers, 3 billion for radio-navigation, and 2 billion for security \nsystems in space. \n\n These are impressive data that however diminish the lack of transparency of the \nUS military programs, which is also the case in other countries where investments are \nnot clear. \n\n Figure  1.7  shows an estimated comparison between the progression of investments \nin the USA and in Europe for civil and military space activities, highlighting the well-\nknown difference. \n\n In Figure  1.8 , the estimated funding for the space sector as a percentage of Gross \nDomestic Product for the three industrialized continents based on the economy mar-\nket is indicated. \n\n \n\n\n\n13\n\n  Figure 1.7.

Qualitative analysis of space  Governance  worldwide.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n It is somehow dif fi cult to analyze those data without considering the strong \nunknowns related to the lack of information on the budget of various entities or \nnations. For instance, it is truly unknown the real level of investment on space activi-\nties of the US Department of State as well as of the US Intelligence Of fi ces which \nheavily rely on space systems. Also level of expenditure in countries such as Russia \nor China are not known, nor declared, and it is nearly impossible to derive those data \nby comparison with western standards such as the labor force cost. \n\n Thus a qualitative analysis of the \u201cGovernance\u201d of the worldwide countries pos-\nsessing space assets capability and technology can be synthesized in Figure  1.9 , \nwhere general considerations are reported to provide a brief assessment of the various \ntypologies of space  Governance . \n\n The management of these expense and investment capabilities is expressed in the \nnations of the world through a governance of the sector that is then brie fl y examined \nwith regard to those countries with signi fi cant technologies. \n\n\n\n15Space Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\n      The United States of America \n\n In the USA, the space sector represents a very  fl exible institutional scenario but the \nstrategic guideline is given by the President. Many civil and military organizations \nthen have the authority and budget to develop and operate space systems. \n\n Figure  1.10  illustrates schematically the institutional scenario of the USA, high-\nlighting the main organizations involved in space activities. \n\n The President expresses the guidelines on space strategy through three main docu-\nments, the \u201cNational Security Strategy,\u201d the \u201cPresidential Decisions Directives\u201d (e.g., \nthe National Space Policy), and the \u201cPresidential Review Directives.\u201d The President \ncan even in fl uence national policy in the sector, by applying his own executive power \nand directly appointing the heads of the principal institutions active in the sector, as \nfor example NASA\u2019s administrator, the civil American space agency. \n\n The other instrument available to the President to in fl uence the guidelines for \nnational space policy is the annual expense budget prepared by the Of fi ce of \nManagement and Budget (OMB) which has powers of evaluation and control on the \noperations of the main agencies. \n\n The President is directly assisted by various consulting organizations, including \nthe \u201cNational Security Council\u201d for all matters regarding security of the country, the \n\u201cNational Science and Technology Council,\u201d and the \u201cOf fi ce of Science and \nTechnology Policy\u201d to improve the coordination of efforts at the federal level in sci-\nence and technological development. \n\n The federal government of the USA invests over 30 billion dollars in the space \nsector each year in known civilian programs. The true military expense, which has \ngrown constantly over the years, is not known. \n\n Figure  1.11  schematically illustrates an estimate of the level of  fi nancial resources \nthat are known to have been used by the USA during the period 2006\u20132009. \n\n The main military and intelligence institutions that realize space systems based on \nmilitary space policy guidelines given by the President are the CIA, the Department \nof Defense DoD, and the National Reconnaissance Of fi ce NRO. \n\n At the operative level, the main military institutions in the sector are the \u201cUS \nSpace and Missile Strategic Command\u201d which develop the main military programs \nfor space, and the \u201cUS SPACECOM\u201d which manages military satellites. \n\n The \u201cNational Space and Aeronautics Administration\u201d NASA is the main and \nmost well-known space agency in the world and is involved in the research and devel-\nopment of civil space activities. \n\n NASA runs ten centers in the USA, as shown in Figure  1.12 , and is active in sci-\nence, aeronautics research, space operations (that is the Shuttle  fl ights until 2011 and \nSpace Station), and exploration. \n\n NASA, almost 40 years after the Apollo Moon missions, had begun an ambitious pro-\ngram of space exploration in 2004 with the aim of having a crew land on Mars by 2050. \n\n Figure  1.13  illustrates, as an example, the overall planning of this exploration \nproject called \u201cConstellation\u201d in which NASA, from 2004 to 2009, had invested \nalmost nine billion dollars. Then in 2010, \u201cConstellation\u201d was essentially cancelled \nby the present administration of President Obama and currently the USA is still in the \ndif fi cult phase of rede fi ning its own space programs. The new Global Exploration \nRoadmap is expected during the second half of 2011 or most likely during 2012. \n\n\n\n16\n\nD\nep\n\nt.\n o\n\nf \nE\n\nn\ner\n\ng\ny\n\n\u2022 \nS\n\nan\ndi\n\na \nN\n\nat\nio\n\nna\nl L\n\nab\n, L\n\nos\nA\n\nla\nm\n\nos\n N\n\nL\n\nP\nre\n\nsi\nd\n\nen\nt o\n\nf \nU\n\nn\nite\n\nd\n S\n\nta\nte\n\ns \no\n\nf A\nm\n\ner\nic\n\na\n\nD\nep\n\nt.\n o\n\nf \nC\n\no\nm\n\nm\ner\n\nce\n\u2022 \n\nN\nat\n\nio\nna\n\nl O\nce\n\nan\nic\n\n &\nA\n\ntm\nos\n\nph\ner\n\nic\n A\n\ndm\nin\n\nis\ntr\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n(N\n\nO\nA\n\nA\n)\n\n\u2022 \nO\n\nffi\nce\n\n o\nf A\n\nir \n&\n\n S\npa\n\nce\nC\n\nom\nm\n\ner\nci\n\nal\niz\n\nat\nio\n\nn\n\nD\nep\n\nt.\n o\n\nf \nIn\n\nte\nri\n\no\nr\n\n\u2022 \nU\n\nS\n G\n\neo\nde\n\ntic\n S\n\nur\nve\n\ny\n\nD\nep\n\nt.\n o\n\nf \nS\n\nta\nte\n\n\u2022 \nD\n\nef\nen\n\nce\n T\n\nra\nde\n\n C\non\n\ntr\nol\n\ns\n\u2022 \n\nO\nce\n\nan\ns,\n\n E\nnv\n\niro\nnm\n\nen\nt a\n\nnd\nS\n\nci\nen\n\nce\n\nD\nep\n\nt.\n o\n\nf \nT\n\nra\nn\n\nsp\no\n\nrt\nat\n\nio\nn\n\n\u2022 \nF\n\nA\nA\n\n\u2022 \nC\n\nom\nm\n\ner\nci\n\nal\n S\n\npa\nce\n\nT\nra\n\nns\npo\n\nrt\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nN\nA\n\nS\nA\n\nN\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nal\n A\n\ner\no\n\nn\nau\n\nti\ncs\n\n&\n S\n\np\nac\n\ne \nA\n\nd\nm\n\nin\nis\n\ntr\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nN\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nal\n S\n\nec\nu\n\nri\nty\n\n \nC\n\no\nu\n\nn\nci\n\nl\n\nN\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nal\n S\n\nci\nen\n\nce\n &\n\nT\nec\n\nh\nn\n\no\nlo\n\ng\ny \n\n C\no\n\nu\nn\n\nci\nl\n\nO\nff\n\nic\ne \n\no\nf \n\nS\nci\n\nen\nce\n\n &\nT\n\nec\nh\n\nn\no\n\nlo\ng\n\ny \nP\n\no\nlic\n\ny\n\nO\nff\n\nic\ne \n\no\nf \n\nM\nan\n\nag\nem\n\nen\nt \n\n&\n \n\nB\nu\n\nd\ng\n\net\n\nN\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nal\n S\n\nec\nu\n\nri\nty\n\n \nS\n\np\nac\n\ne \nA\n\nrc\nh\n\nit\nec\n\nt\n\nC\nIA\n\nN\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nal\n \n\nR\nec\n\no\nn\n\nn\nai\n\nss\nan\n\nce\n \n\nO\nff\n\nic\ne \n\n(N\nR\n\nO\n)\n\nD\nep\n\nt.\n o\n\nf \nD\n\nef\nen\n\nce\n\nB\nal\n\nlis\nti\n\nc \nM\n\nis\nsi\n\nle\n \n\nD\nef\n\nen\nce\n\n \nO\n\nrg\nan\n\niz\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nJo\nin\n\nt \nS\n\nta\nff\n\n\u2022 \nU\n\nS\n S\n\npa\nce\n\n C\nom\n\nm\nan\n\nd\n\nU\nS\n\n A\nrm\n\ned\n \n\nF\no\n\nrc\nes\n\nU\nS\n\n N\nav\n\ny\nU\n\nS\n A\n\nir\n F\n\no\nrc\n\ne\nU\n\nS\n A\n\nrm\ny\n\nU\nS\n\n C\no\n\nn\ng\n\nre\nss\n\nH\nou\n\nse\nS\n\nen\nat\n\ne\n\nM\nai\n\nn \nA\n\nct\nor\n\ns \nin\n\nvo\nlv\n\ned\n in\n\n th\ne \n\nU\nS\n\n S\npa\n\nce\n G\n\nov\ner\n\nna\nnc\n\ne\n\nN\nIM\n\nA\n\n  F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 1\n.1\n\n0.\n  \n\n   U\nS\n\n I\nn\n\nst\nit\n\nu\nti\n\no\nn\n\nal\n S\n\nce\nn\n\nar\nio\n\n c\no\n\nn\nce\n\nrn\nin\n\ng\n t\n\nh\ne \n\nsp\nac\n\ne \nse\n\nct\no\n\nr. \n(J\n\nan\ne\u2019\n\ns \non\n\nlin\ne \n\nso\nur\n\nce\n, \n\nU\nS\n\n S\npa\n\nce\n C\n\nom\nm\n\nis\nsi\n\non\n p\n\nub\nlic\n\n r\nel\n\nea\nse\n\n r\nep\n\nor\nt \n\nso\nur\n\nce\n, \n\nP\nre\n\nss\n \n\nre\nle\n\nas\ne \n\nso\nur\n\nce\n, \n\nF\nin\n\nm\nec\n\n ca\nni\n\nca\n S\n\npA\n e\n\nla\nbo\n\nra\ntio\n\nn \nso\n\nur\nce\n\n).\n       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n \n\n\n\n17\n\n  Figure 1.11.

(NASA source).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n At this time the US space policy seems oriented toward a new strategic division of \nresponsibility between the scienti fi c and technological community, with NASA as a \npoint of reference, and the DoD and intelligence agencies as a clearly military point \nof reference. \n\n One could assume that in the near future US policy will see a broad mandate being \ngiven to NASA for world leadership in scienti fi c exploration and research and devel-\nopment and just as broad a mandate to the DoD and Intelligence for security and \ndefense applications. \n\n Access to space and the use of near-Earth space could be co-participated in by \nprivate industries operating on a commercial basis co fi nanced by NASA. \n\n The situation seems just as uncertain  fi nancially as well as strategically. Notice for \nexample in Figure  1.14  the trend in NASA\u2019s budget from 2009 to the subsequent years on \nthe basis of presidential requests, on the OMB\u2019s forecasts and the pragmatic ones of NASA \nitself on the basis of a budget which by law cannot be inferior to that of the previous year. \n\n It is not yet of fi cially clear which scenario will be most probable but it appears evi-\ndent that the difference of several billion dollars will affect NASA\u2019s program lines. \n\n The American agency went through a period of change due to the cancelation of \nthe \u201cConstellation\u201d program in which new launchers and spacecraft were to be devel-\noped and to the retirement of the three Shuttles of the  fl eet from 2011. \n\n Figure  1.15  reveals the variation per program of NASA government  fi nancing in \nthe period 2010\u20132012. \n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\n  Figure 1.14.    Forecasts for NASA\u2019s budget from 2009 to 2016. (NASA source).       \n\nSpace Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\n As we can infer from the 2012 budget, NASA foresees the use of a large part of \nthe 2.4 billion dollars not anymore for Shuttle  fl ight costs, but to increase the expense \nof commercial  fl ights, that is, to entrust the sending of materials and men to the ISS \nto private industries, to increase research and development of the technologies and \nuse of the Space Station. \n\n What is not yet clear is the strategy of development of human space exploration \nfor the next decade.  \n\n      Europe: The European Space Agency ESA \n\n ESA is an intergovernmental agency charged with the development of space capabili-\nties for the continent \u201cfor peaceful purposes.\u201d ESA began its activities in 1975, but \nwas created 2 years prior during a meeting between the Ministers of ten European \ncountries to integrate two European organizations, ELDO (European Launcher \nDevelopment Organization) and ESRO (European Space Research Organization) \nboth founded at the beginning of the 1960s. \n\n During its 30 years of existence, ESA has contributed to making Europe a top-\nranking space power with a solid industrial base, bene fi ting from a high level of \nautonomy in most of the sectors of space technology. \n\n ESA member states number 19 today, but in the future it will be broadened to \ninclude 22. The member states are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, \nGermany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal, the \nUK, Spain, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Switzerland, and Romania. In addition, \nCanada and Hungary participate in several projects based on cooperation agreements. \nAs we can see from the list, not all the member states of the European Union are \nmembers of ESA and vice versa. \n\n \n\n\n\n20\n\n  F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 1\n.1\n\n5.\n  \n\n  C\no\n\nm\np\n\nar\nis\n\no\nn\n\n o\nf \n\nN\nA\n\nS\nA\n\n\u2019s\n 2\n\n01\n0 \n\nan\nd\n\n e\nst\n\nim\nat\n\ned\n 2\n\n01\n2 \n\nbu\nd\n\ng\net\n\n.

In order to do this, ESA \n collects, coordinates, and spends  fi nancial resources paid by Member States through \nits national space agencies. \n\n In this way, ESA can undertake programs and activities that are very often superior \nto those possible through single European nations. \n\n European projects are conceived to study as much as possible the Earth and its \nsurrounding space environment, the Solar System, and the universe in general, but the \ndevelopment of space systems applications, technology, and satellite services is also \na major sector. \n\n ESA is a completely independent organization even though it maintains close ties \nwith the European Union based on a framework agreement signed between the \nEuropean Commission and ESA itself. The two organizations share in fact a joint \nspace strategy and are developing a European space policy according to a common \nvision. \n\n ESA has its own central headquarters in Paris where programs and policies are \ndecided, but it also has important operational centers in other European countries.\n\n   ESTEC, the \u201cEuropean Space Research and Technology Centre,\u201d is the techno-\u2022 \nlogical center with the greatest number of employees and is located in Noordwijk, \nthe Netherlands.  \n  ESOC, the \u201cEuropean Space Operations Centre,\u201d is the center for the orbital con-\u2022 \ntrol of satellites and ISS operations and is located in Darmstadt, Germany.  \n  EAC, the \u201cEuropean Astronauts Centre,\u201d is the training center for European astro-\u2022 \nnauts and is located in Cologne, Germany.  \n  ESAC, the \u201cEuropean Space Astronomy Centre,\u201d at Villanueva de la Ca\u00f1ada, near \u2022 \nMadrid in Spain, hosts the scienti fi c operations centers for ESA\u2019s astronomy and \nplanetary missions, along with their scienti fi c archives. It provides services to \nastronomical research projects worldwide.  \n  ESRIN, the \u201cEuropean Space Research Institute,\u201d is the center responsible for \u2022 \ncoordinating the Vega and GMES programs and is located in Frascati, Italy. In \naddition to gathering, archiving, and distributing satellite data for ESA partners, it \nfunctions as a technological information center for the entire agency.  \n  CSG, the \u201cEuropean Space Port\u201d located in the \u201cCentre Spatial Guyanais\u201d in \u2022 \nKourou, French Guyana, is the European spaceport for the takeoff of ESA\u2019s \nlaunchers. The center and launch base were created by CNES, the French space \nagency since the 1970s, and was later notably increased in size under ESA\u2019s spon-\nsorship. The CSG is ideally located on the northern coast of South America, which \nallows space launches over the Atlantic Ocean.  \n  Ground stations are Salmij\u00e4rvi, Sweden, Redu, Belgium, Villafranca Del Castillo, \u2022 \nSpain and Kourou, French Guiana. The Salmij\u00e4rvi station near Kiruna, at high \naltitude, works with satellites that observe the Earth which follow a polar orbit, \nwhile the Redu station works especially with telecommunication satellites that \norbit over the equator. Operations related to astronomy satellites and scienti fi c \nprograms are carried out at Villafranca. The main role of the Kourou ground sta-\ntion is to communicate with satellites shortly after their launch. ESA also uses a \ntracking station located in Perth, Australia, and has access to other stations in the \nworld, according to the needs of its missions.    \n\n\n\n  Figure 1.16.

ESA\u2019s 2011 budget and breakdown of expenditure. (ESA source).       \n\nSpace Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\n ESA\u2019s budget has been stable for many years and if we compare it to the NASA \ncivilian budget, we can see that Europe spends one-sixth of the amount. \n\n In 2011, 18 Member States increased the agency\u2019s budget by 7% with respect to \n2010, but this increase was mainly generated by France and Germany, as well as by \nexternal contributions, such as the European Union with 778 million euro and EumetSat \nwith 233 billion euro. Figure  1.18  illustrates how ESA\u2019s budget was divided in 2011. \n\n Space science and general budget operations are called by statute \u201cobligatory\u201d \nprograms by ESA. These programs are funded with an obligatory economic contribu-\ntion by all Member States calculated on the basis of each country\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct. \n\n Then ESA develops a certain number of so-called \u201coptional\u201d programs to which \neach single country is free to subscribe or not, deciding its  fi nancial level of participa-\ntion and support. \n\n The relationship between mandatory and optional expenditures is illustrated in \nFigure  1.19  according to each member state, relative to the 2008\u20132009 period. It can \nbe inferred that France, Germany, and Italy were and are to date, in order, the major \ncountries that contribute annually to ESA\u2019s budget; in fact, the level of resources \ninvested by these three countries makes up 60% of its total budget. \n\n ESA operates on the basis of geographical sharing criteria. It reinvests in each \nmember state by means of industrial contracts for space programs with an amount \nalmost equivalent to the  fi nancing provided by that country. \n\n Approximately 12\u201318% of the  fi nancing of each program is therefore kept by the \nagency to cover its own operating expenses. \n\n \n\n\n\n24\n\n150\n\n132,101\n107,011\n\n93,710\n77,689\n\n44,316\n27,085\n20,677\n16,566\n\nMember States\ncontributions to ESA s\nmandatory programmes\ncalculated on the\nbasis of their GNP.\n\nTotal of Member States\ncontributions to ESA s\nmandatory and\noptional programmes.\n\nMember States mandatory contributions\nwith total mandatory and optional contributions\nto ESA programmes.\n\n15,598\n13,543\n12,454\n10,641\n8,464\n6,711\n5,249\n4,638\n7,255\n0,693\n\nComparison\n\n11,100L\nP\n\nG\n\nN\nA\nS\n\nCH\nNL\n\nGB\n\nB\n\nE\n\nF\n\nD\n\nI\n\nCDN\n\nIRL\nPIN\nDK\n\n16,660\n20,000\n11,400\n13,300\n16,400\n23,918\n43,959\n32,800\n\n54,678\n138,401\n\n87,136\n98,026\n\n152,831\n343,046\n\n556,491\n\n533,470\n264,900\n\n100 50 100 200 300 400 5000 0M\n\n  Figure 1.19.

The Council de fi nes \nand approves the guidelines on the basis of which the agency then provides for the \ndevelopment of its programs. Each member state, represented in the Council, from \nthe President of National space agencies, has the right to one vote, according to its \nsize or its existing  fi nancial contribution. \n\n The agency is managed by a Director General, elected by the Council every \n4 years. Each single research sector has its own Directorate that is under the direct \nauthority of the Director General. \n\n Every 3 years, ESA\u2019s Council meets in plenary session with the participation of \nthe European Ministers who have the authority of their respective governments for \nspace operations, and on that occasion, long-term large programs and their  fi nancing \nare discussed and decided upon, thus obtaining guarantees from the highest political \nlevel of each country. \n\n The above-mentioned plan is illustrated in Figure  1.20 . \n ESA\u2019s major achievements include:\n\n   Space launchers: the Ariane launch vehicles series since the 1970s has been the \u2022 \nstrategic instrument for autonomous access to space for Europe. In 2011 and 2012, \nthe Vega launchers, designed by Italy, and the Soyuz were added to the Ariane \nlineup.  \n  Satellite platform and payload technologies, developed in the 1970s and 1980s, are \u2022 \nthe foundation for the current generation of European telecommunication \nsatellites.  \n\n \n\n\n\n25\n\nESA Heads of\nDelegation Council\n\nESA Director \nGeneral\n\nESA Directors\n\nNational \nDelegations\n\nMember States\n\nNational Ministers\n\nEuropean Industry\n\nProgram Boards\nScientific \n\nAdvisory Board\n\nAnnual Budget \nfor Country \n\nparticipation to \nPrograms\n\nESA Programs \nManagement \n\nSingle Country \nParticipation\n\nMandatory\nPrograms\n(science)\n\nOptional\nPrograms\n\nEuropean Ministerial \nCouncil\n\n  Figure 1.20.

For the public \u201ccall for astronauts\u201d published in 2008, \napproximately 9,000 men and women all over Europe presented their applications, \nproof of the space sector\u2019s appeal.     \n\n      Europe: The European Commission \n\n Space operations in Europe in the last 10 years have also witnessed the progressive \nand signi fi cant involvement of the European Commission. \n\n In 2000, the European Union Council approved the recommendation of Parliament \nfor the creation of a \u201cEuropean Space Policy,\u201d and consequently in 2003, the \nEuropean Commission published a \u201cWhite Book\u201d on space. These formal steps \n\n \n\n\n\n26 Space Program Management\n\n constituted the  fi rst decision-making processes for making the space sector in Europe \na strategic factor for the continent. \n\n After a long joint period in 2004, the European Commission and ESA adopted a \n\u201cFramework Agreement\u201d which regulates the relations between ESA and the \nEuropean Union and de fi nes the framework of cooperation between the two bodies. \n\n During the fourth \u201cSpace Council,\u201d on 22 May 2007, the two organizations \napproved, at the Ministerial level, a \u201cResolution on European Space Policy,\u201d the ESP, \nwhich established the foundation for a European space policy shared by the European \nUnion, ESA, and the Member States. \n\n Basically, Europe gave itself formal guidelines for a common strategic policy in \nthe space sector and to make strategic infrastructures of these systems, considered by \nthe Union to be components of the security policy for the defense of Europe. \n\n The \u201cEuropean Space Policy,\u201d subscribed to by the authorized European ministers \non space, constitutes one more step toward a new European governance in the sector, \naimed at a new institutional project that should see the strategic policy of space of the \nfuture managed at the highest levels of the European Union and the operational policy \nof ESA acted upon in coordination with the European Commission. \n\n Through the adoption of the \u201cESP,\u201d the European Union, ESA, and its member \nstates commit themselves to improving and increasing, wherever possible, the coor-\ndination of their operations and their programs and organizing them according to the \nroles attributed to them respectively, thus avoiding duplications. \n\n The \u201cESP\u201d is drawn up jointly and a preliminary version of the European space \nprogram, that is, a strategic document that supplies an overall vision of its current and \nfuture operations foreseen in the next 5\u201310 years, with a focus on operations foreseen \nuntil 2013 in line with the  fi nancial outlook of the Union, is released. \n\n Beyond the bureaucratese, the real meaning of the above is in some way revolu-\ntionary with respect to the past and present. \n\n In fact, at the present state, within the framework of the European Commission, \nfrom November 2004, space policy and its subsequent activities will no longer be \nmanaged by the General Research Administration but by the General Direction of \nEnterprises and industry. \n\n This con fi rms the strategic importance given to space as an instrument for the \ndevelopment on one hand European security and defense policies and on the other \nhand the development of environmental, transportation, agriculture and rural devel-\nopment,  fi shing, research, and other policies. \n\n It seems evident that this process of institutional architecture of a new European \ngovernance of the sector cannot ignore the increasingly signi fi cant role of the \nEuropean Commission in the future. \n\n At present, space activities brought forward in the framework of the European Union \nare the Galileo and GMES programs and several research missions  fi nanced through \nframework research and technological development programs of the European Union. \n\n The framework programs of the Commission are the instruments of multiyear \n fi nancing which concern various sectors of operation of the Union. For the 2007\u2013\n2013 period, the seventh framework program has overall 54 billion euro available for \ninvestments, but the budget foreseen for the space sector is around 1.4 billion euro, \nof which 1 billion euro directly contributed by ESA for the realization of Earth \n\n\n\n27Space Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\n observation space systems (\u201cSentinels\u201d satellites) and satellite radio-navigation \n(\u201cGalileo\u201d program). \n\n For \u201cGalileo,\u201d the radio-navigation satellite program, the European Commission \nearmarked in 2008 for the years 2009\u20132013 an additional 3.4 billion euro that it will \nput at the disposal of ESA for the completion and launch of the satellite system. \n\n In light of the above, it is evident that the progressive role of the European \nCommission will not be limited merely to disbursing funds, but also to managing and \ncoordinating, and since the Commission is an organization of the European Union, \nthe fact of coordinating space missions, declared strategic by the Union itself, could \nbecome disruptive for space policy. \n\n The operations of ESA primarily concerning science and therefore with peaceful \npurposes could become \u201crevolutionized\u201d to respond to the increased needs of the \nUnion in the matter of security, environmental monitoring, and cultural diffusion. \n\n However, it is especially the rule of \u201cJust Return\u201d which was a management cor-\nnerstone and an instrument of \u201ccompensation\u201d of the various needs of each nation, \nmight disappear since the Commission is adopting the criterion of competition and \nthe so-called \u201cbest value for money.\u201d  \n\n      Europe: France \n\n France is the European country, which has considered space missions essential for its \nmilitary, political, and economic strategy since the end of the Second World War. \n\n Since the 1950s therefore, the French space sector has been organized around the \ndefense, research, and civil institutions ministries. \n\n The diagram of Figure  1.21  illustrates the French decision-making political pro-\ncess in space policy. \n\n The French space agency CNES, \u201cCentre Nationale des Etudes Spatiales,\u201d was \ncreated in 1961 with the mission and objective of coordinating and developing French \nspace policy and of driving European operations. \n\n In fact, France was always a supporter of a strong national space policy even \nthrough European space programs and institutions such as ESA, and has structured a \ngovernance of the sector where strategic policy is de fi ned at the highest level of state. \nThere is in fact the so-called \u201cConseil supr\u00eame de l\u2018Espace\u201d presided over by the \nPresident of the Republic, similar to the USA, which issues the guidelines of French \nspace policy. \n\n The French space agency can manage complex programs thanks to the expertise \nof its technical centers such as the \u201cCentre Spatial\u201d in Toulouse, where over a thou-\nsand people work, the \u201cCentre Spatial des lanceurs\u201d in Evry, which guides and devel-\nops the launch operations of Ariane, and the \u201cCentre Spatial Guyanais,\u201d CSG in \nFrench Guinea where over a thousand member staff are employed and where the \nlaunch facilities are located. The centers are illustrated in Figure  1.22 . \n\n Figure  1.23  schematically illustrates the level of  fi nancial resources used by CNES \nduring the 2006\u20132009 period for contributions in ESA and for national investment. \nThrough a framework program with its own minister, CNES has affected an effective \n fi nancial policy that can maintain a stable resource level, of which 685 million for \nESA in that period. \n\n\n\n28\n\nGovernment\n\nMinister of Defence Minister of Research\n\nESA\n\nOther EU Space \nAgencies\n\nResearch Laboratories \nand Universities\n\nResearch Centers\n\nIndustry\n\nDefine national strategy for space\n\nFunding\n\nDefine funding and \nimplementation of \nEuropean Policy\n\nCooperation\n\nCooperation\n\nFunding\n\nPresident\n\nApprove national strategy for space\n\n  Figure 1.21.

It is evident that its ESA \ncontribution is almost equivalent to the costs of its national programs. \n\n The highest expenditure item is the Ariane launchers which are a guarantee for \nautonomous access to space for France, and for Europe; then, scienti fi c missions play \nan important role, but it is interesting to note that CNES directly manages even mil-\nitary-type operations with the DGA, \u201cDirection G\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Armaments.\u201d \n\n CNES is also very active in international cooperation all over the world with \n application and scienti fi c bilateral programs. \n\n Starting in 2011, CNES foresees increasing its contribution to ESA by 12% with \nrespect to its current value to increase it until 2015. The increase in CNES\u2019s budget \nis the result of a multiyear \u201ccontract\u201d signed by the agency with its own minister of \nreference in order to ensure the continuity of sources for the mid-term period.  \n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\n  Figure 1.22.

The data take into account contributions to ESA. \n\n The Strategic Vision Document DVS 2010\u20132020 was published in 2010. For the \n fi rst time a 10-year plan for the development of space operations in Italy was de fi ned. \nFigure  1.29 , taken from the DVS, illustrates the 10-year expense forecast, an estimated \ntotal of about 7 billion euro divided among the various sectors of operations, while \nFigures.  1.30  and  1.31  illustrate the division of expenses foreseen for both national \nprograms and ESA program contributions, both existing and future. \n\n\n\nGovernment Financial Law Approval from Parliament\n\nComitato Interministeriale di Pianificazione Economica (CIPE)\n\nMinister of Education, \nUniversity and Research \n\n(MIUR)\n\nOther Ministers involved in \nspace (Defence, Foreign \n\nAffairs, \u2026)\n\nAgenzia Spaziale Italiana \n(ASI)\n\nUniversities and other \nResearch centers\n\nDefinition of Space \nNational Plan \n\nContracts for R&D \nContracts for development\n\nFinancing for R&D\n\nAd-hoc Financing \n\nContracts for R&D\n\nIndustry\n\n  Figure 1.26.

It put the  fi rst arti fi cial satel-\nlite, the Sputnik, into orbit in 1957, then the  fi rst man in space in 1961, and it built \nthe  fi rst space station, the Mir, in 1986. \n\n Space policy was directed by the government\u2019s chief executive and the manage-\nment of space affairs was under the authority of military organizations. \n\n \n\n\n\n37Space Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\n The fall of the Soviet system in 1990 brought about a decline in space missions \nthat were harmed by the lack of a legislative framework of reference, with the subse-\nquent drastic reduction of space sector staff (a reduction of 200,000 employees in less \nthan 10 years) and the type of programs. \n\n In 2000, however, the Russian government once again considered the space sector \nas one of its main institutional priorities and drew up its  fi rst federal space program \nin 2001\u20132005. \n\n The Russian space agency Roscosmos RKA was created to put this program into \nplace. \n\n At the same time, the level of industrial international and government cooperation \nwas increased with the USA, Europe, and India. \n\n Today the most in fl uential bodies in de fi ning Russian space policy are RKA \nRoscosmos and the Defense Ministry. \n\n The main objectives of the RKA are:\n\n   To de fi ne the federal space program with the Defense Ministry, the Russian \u2022 \nScience Academy, and other Ministries  \n  To de fi ne and implement national policy concerning space research and the use of \u2022 \nspace for peaceful purposes  \n  To regulate and coordinate space affairs with those of the space industrial sector  \u2022 \n  To establish international cooperation  \u2022 \n  To de fi ne and fund space research and development programs  \u2022 \n  To develop space solutions for the economic and social well-being of Russia, to \u2022 \ndevelop and guide Russian space sector organizations  \n  To de fi ne the budget aimed at the space sector with the Defense Ministry    \u2022 \n\n The main objectives of the Defense Ministry are:\n\n   To participate in the de fi nition of the national space program to de fi ne the require-\u2022 \nments of military space technologies and dual systems to de fi ne military \nprocurement  \n  To de fi ne the budget for the military space sector to provide ground support \u2022 \ninfrastructures  \n  To manage launch infrastructures and the operations of spacecraft to de fi ne the \u2022 \nnational space launchers plan  \n  To take part in implementing space programs for civilian use    \u2022 \n\n The diagram of Figure  1.34  tentatively illustrates the Russian decision-making \npolitical process in space. \n\n In the federal space program 2006\u20132015, 8.9 billion euro are shown for civilian \nspace operations. Additional 5.3 billion euro are from nonspeci fi ed private invest-\nments. Military expenses are not detailed. \n\n Additional of fi cial information was given by Russian Prime Minister Vladimir \nPutin on 12 January 2011 during a press conference where he stated 115 billion rubles \n(in the current exchange 2.93 billion euro) for the 2011 federal space budget. He \ncon fi rmed that Russian priorities were to complete the \u201cGlonass\u201d satellite system that \nis analogous to the American GPS and to improve launch systems and relative launch \nbases. \n\n\n\n38\n\nP\nre\n\nsi\nd\n\nen\nt\n\nP\nrim\n\ne \nM\n\nin\nis\n\nte\nr\n\nM\nin\n\nis\nte\n\nr \nof\n\n \nF\n\nor\nei\n\ngn\n O\n\nffi\nce\n\nM\nin\n\nis\nte\n\nr \nof\n\n \nD\n\nef\nen\n\nce\nM\n\nin\nis\n\nte\nr \n\nof\nF\n\nin\nan\n\nce\nD\n\num\na\n\nD\nef\n\nin\niti\n\non\n o\n\nf S\npa\n\nce\n P\n\nol\nic\n\ny \nan\n\nd \nS\n\ntr\nat\n\neg\ny\n\nB\nud\n\nge\nt\n\nR\nes\n\nea\nrc\n\nh \nce\n\nnt\ner\n\ns\nIn\n\ndu\nst\n\nry\nM\n\nili\nta\n\nry\n S\n\npa\nce\n\n F\nor\n\nce\ns\n\nIn\nte\n\nrn\nat\n\nio\nna\n\nl \nS\n\npa\nce\n\n A\nge\n\nnc\nie\n\ns\n\nR\nus\n\nsi\nan\n\n \nS\n\nci\nen\n\nce\n \n\nA\nca\n\nde\nm\n\ny\n\nS\nta\n\nte\n O\n\nffi\nce\n\n fo\nr\n\nG\neo\n\nlo\ngy\n\n a\nnd\n\nca\nrt\n\nog\nra\n\nph\ny\n\nS\nta\n\nte\n O\n\nffi\nce\n\n fo\nr \n\nm\net\n\neo\nro\n\nlo\ngy\n\n a\nnd\n\n \nen\n\nvi\nro\n\nnm\nen\n\nta\nl \n\nco\nnt\n\nro\nl\n\nS\nta\n\nte\n C\n\nom\nm\n\nitt\nee\n\nfo\nr \n\nC\nom\n\nm\nun\n\nic\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nan\nsd\n\n In\nfo\n\nrm\nat\n\nio\nn\n\nM\nin\n\nis\nte\n\nr \nof\n\nS\nci\n\nen\nce\n\n a\nnd\n\nT\nec\n\nhn\nol\n\nog\ny\n\nR\nus\n\nsi\nan\n\n S\npa\n\nce\nA\n\nge\nnc\n\ny \nR\n\nK\nA\n\n  F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 1\n.3\n\n4.\n  \n\n   R\nu\n\nss\nia\n\nn\n in\n\nst\nit\n\nu\nti\n\no\nn\n\nal\n s\n\nce\nn\n\nar\nio\n\n c\no\n\nn\nce\n\nrn\nin\n\ng\n th\n\ne \nsp\n\nac\ne \n\nse\nct\n\no\nr. \n\n(J\nan\n\ne\u2019\ns \n\non\nlin\n\ne \nso\n\nur\nce\n\n, R\nK\n\nA\n w\n\neb\n s\n\nite\n s\n\nou\nrc\n\ne,\n P\n\nre\nss\n\n r\nel\n\nea\nse\n\n s\nou\n\nrc\ne,\n\n F\nin\n\nm\nec\n\nca\nni\n\nca\n \n\nS\npA\n\n e\nla\n\nbo\nra\n\ntio\nn \n\nso\nur\n\nce\n).\n\n       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n \n\n\n\n39\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\nR\nub\n\nle\ns \n\nbi\nlli\n\non\ns\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n2007\n\nFederal Programs Glonass System Launch Bases\n\n2008 2009 2010 2011\n(forecast) (forecast) (forecast)\n\n2012 2013\n\n  Figure 1.35.

Figure  1.35  illustrates an \nestimation of the progress of annual investments of the Russian space program from \n2007 to 2013. \n\n In 2010, the Russian space budget was therefore increased by 10.9% compared to \nthe previous year and represents about 88% of the government\u2019s general budget. \n\n The strategic Glonass program has a dedicated fund. It is expected to be concluded \nin the next few years with the complete launch of its satellite constellation. \n\n Budget forecasts until 2013 increased to 28% on an annual basis, a con fi rmation \nof the government\u2019s continuous attention to this sector. \n\n The main Russian industries that bene fi t from government  fi nancing are \nKhrounichev, NPO EnergoMach, and NPO Machinostroenie, which develop launch-\ners and satellites. \n\n Military space programs in a lateral sense are included in this budget, but could \nbene fi t from additional unknown  fi nancing.  \n\n \n\n\n\n40\n\nPrime Minister\n\nSpace\nDepartment\n\nRadar\ninfrastructure\nStratosphere\n\nand\nTrophosphere\n\nPhysics\nResearch\n\nLaboratories\n\nEarth Obseravtion\nNational Agency\n\nNational Agency\nfor Resource\nManagement\n\nSpace Agency\nISRO\n\nANTRIX\n\nSpace Center\nVikhram\nSarabhai\n\nShar Center\nISRO\n\nSatellite\nCenter ISAC\n\nCenter for\nspace\n\napplications\n\nCenter for\nliquid\n\npropulsion\n\nISRO Unit\nfor inertial\nsystems\n(IISU)\n\nMaster Control\nFacility (MCF)\n\nUnit for\nEducation and\ncommunication\n\nSpace Commision\n\n  Figure 1.36.

It coordinates and de fi nes the guidelines for the other cen-\nters and national space laboratories and supports ISRO for remote sensing and is \nresponsible for receiving, processing, and distributing satellite data. In addition, it \nsupports the \u201cPhysical Research\u201d laboratory which is the main research center for the \ncountry. \n\n The \u201cSpace Commission\u201d de fi nes the highest level policies of the sector. \n Finally, the ISRO agency is responsible for all space programs and manages inter-\n\nnational partnerships. It is responsible for the development of satellite launchers, \nmanaging the development contracts with industries. \n\n India has developed complete long-term technical and industrial competences all \nalong the value chain, from manufacturing to operations including supply of satellite \nservices, and is therefore a formidable autonomous player with over 16,000 employ-\nees in the sector. \n\n At the moment, it has not yet developed astronaut capability. \n Figure  1.37  schematically illustrates estimates of the economic resources used by \n\nISRO for the 2006\u20132011 period and shows a signi fi cant increase in spending for this \nsector. \n\n This increase should be con fi rmed in 2011\u20132012, to over 1.4 billion dollars, and \namong main programs where there should be a signi fi cant increase in spending we \nnote habitable  fl ights at about 25 million dollars, heavy launcher GSLV-III at about \n\n \n\n\n\n41\n\n  Figure 1.37.

The \nyen has an arti fi cial development and the cost of work is signi fi cantly inferior to \nWestern standards. For example, we can see that in 2007 the GDP/inhabitant declared \nin China was 2,000 USD, while in Japan, in the same geographical area, was 33,000 \nUSD, 16 times higher. \n\n Broadly speaking, if we wish to multiply the Chinese space budget, estimated at \n2.5 billion dollars by 16, we would get a value relatively comparable to the American \ncivilian and military budget. \n\n Con fi rming this, there is an interesting data we can extrapolate from what was \nof fi cially declared by one of the two vice-administrators of the CNSA upon his visit \nto the USA in April 2006 (ESPI source) according to which China spends for its work \nforce of about 200,000 in the sector a little less than 400 million euro per year. \n\n These data compared to comparable values in the USA or in Europe are absolutely \nout of scale compared to the Western market economy. \n\n China is the only country in the world, after the USA and Russia, to have acquired \nautonomous capability in sending astronauts into space, and this is a result of the \nevident Chinese political doctrine of following strategic objectives of military \nsupremacy on the global scale.  \n\n      Japan \n\n In the 1960s, space research was begun in Japan. Two separate agencies were set up, \none for applications and one for science, which developed programs, satellites, and \nlaunchers, with relative launcher bases, in a separate and autonomous way. \n\n One agency was NASDA-National Space Development Agency, founded in 1969 \nlocated at the Tanegashima Space Center, on Tanegashima Island, about 115 km south \nof Kyushu. The other agency was ISAS which was under the authority of the Ministry \nof Education; it was part of the University of Tokyo until 1981 and was located at the \nKagoshima Space Center. \n\n The government expanded space activities in 2003 and merged NASDA, the \nNational Aerospace Laboratory of Japan (NAL) and ISAS into one single agency, the \nJapan Aerospace exploration Agency-JAXA. \n\n The JAXA Agency therefore became a single government agency for space affairs \nin Japan that interacts with other public agencies that are connected in one way or \nanother to space research. \n\n Figure  1.39  illustrates the institutional schema of space sector \u201cGovernance\u201d in \nJapan. \n\n JAXA has inherited many research centers and of fi ces in Japan from NASDA, \nISAS, and NAL, including:\n\n   Central headquarter in Tokyo  \u2022 \n  Earth Observation Research Center (EORC), in Tokyo  \u2022 \n  Earth Observation Center (EOC) in Hatayama  \u2022 \n  Noshiro Testing Center (NTC)\u2014established in 1962, and involved in the develop-\u2022 \nment and testing of motors used in rockets  \n  Sanriku Balloon Center (SBC)\u2014used for balloon experiments since 1971  \u2022 \n\n\n\n44\n\nMinistry of Internal\nAffairs and\n\nCommunication\n\nMinistry of Education,\nCulture, Sport, Science\n\nand Technology\n\nMinistry of Agriculture,\nForestry and Fisheries\n\nMinistry of\nEnvironment\n\nNational Institute of\nInformation and\nCommunication\n\nTechnology\n\nSpace Activities\nCommission\n\nJapan\nMetorological\n\nAgencyJapan Space\nExploration Agency\n\nSecretariat\n\nPrime Minister\n\nCouncil for\nScience and\n\ntechnology (CSTP)\n\nMinistry of Land,\nInfrastructure and\n\nTransport\n\nMinistry of\nEconomy, Trade\n\nand Industry\n\n  Figure 1.39.

Equipments for the Japanese Experiment \nModule, Kibo, of the ISS are developed here and astronaut training.    \n\n Figure  1.40  shows the geographical location of various centers located all over the \nisland. \n\n Figure  1.41  schematically illustrates the estimated level of  fi nancial resources used \nby JAXA in the 2006\u20132008 period and shows a substantially stable budget. \n\n However, this budget could increase in the near future because of a radical politi-\ncal change that occurred in 2008. In fact, in February, Japan appointed a minister for \n\u201cSpace Development\u201d for the  fi rst time after the war for security and defense. In so \ndoing, it broke a condition it had kept for decades, preventing the paci fi st nation from \nstarting up space programs for defense. \n\n The appointment was put into effect after the approval of a new law, which \nallowed the use of space for defense purposes, a prohibited activity for Japan after \nWorld War II but which was considered necessary because of growing fears of mili-\ntary threats in the Asian area. \n\n The new law\u2019s objective was to remove any legal obstacle to the building of new-\ngeneration spy satellites, and to the innovation of the national space industry. \n\n In fact, Japan has increased military research ever since North Korea launched a \nballistic missile in 1998 near to Japanese territory. Space missions are of major inter-\nest under this perspective. \n\n Japan has also expanded its space exploration program and is presently conducting \none of the largest robotic lunar missions in the world of the last decades. \n\n It is also conducting innovative robotic explorations of distant objects, such as \nasteroids, attempting to land probes on these objects to bring back material back to \nEarth. \n\n \n\n\n\n45\n\n  Figure 1.40.

De fi nition and Segmentation of the \u201cSpace Market\u201d \nin the World \n\n If we turned back our minds through the years today to the \u201ccold war\u201d period, that is \nthe 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, it would be dif fi cult to imagine that space affairs in the \nworld could have become an industrial and services sector that could move 100 bil-\nlion dollars a year in the third millennium. \n\n In our days, the space market cannot be solely identi fi ed with industrial produc-\ntion, which is, manufacturing, of space systems, but also of the sale of services and \napplications that derive from them. \n\n Space services worldwide at this point surpass manufacturing as business share. \n Figure  1.43  shows the division in 2009 of business volume, worldwide of about \n\n130 billion dollars, relative to space missions in the world, both manufacturing and \nservices. \n\n The services share of business is much larger than manufacturing; the value of \nspace services sales, driven by pay-tv television packets, was valued at 68 billion \ndollars in 2009. \n\n \n\n\n\n47\n\n  Figure 1.43.

The suppliers of devices and equipment, the so-called \n\u201cpayloads,\u201d are numbered to be over 300. Prime Contractors and subsystem special-\nists are part of this group, either directly or through controlled companies. \n\n Figure  1.45  outlines the above industrial state of affairs. \n On the other hand, the so-called \u201cservices and applications market\u201d is not as easy to \n\noutline as manufacturing because there are many operators worldwide who operate or \nuse space systems for telecommunications, imaging, and radio-navigation services. \n\n      The Manufacturing Market \n\n Because of its strategic nature, the space sector essentially depends on institutional \nbudgets (space agencies and research institutions), whereas the institutional market \nprevails in manufacturing with respect to the commercial one. Moreover, almost 80% \nof the world institutional market is American and is accessible only to American \ncompanies given its strategic and military value. \n\n Recently, the European Union recognized the space sector as strategic, explicitly \nmentioning it in the text of the new \u201cTreaty of the Union.\u201d However, today main civil \nprograms are basically developed only within ESA, while military programs are frag-\nmented among national initiatives. \n\n Therefore, the commercial market has been a driving force for European \n industries, especially for the realization and sales of telecommunication commercial \nsatellites and Ariane launchers. In the most recent years, this market has grown less \ncompared to the boom years of the 1990s. However, it is slowly recovering. The \ncommercial drive stems from the increase in broadband communication services and \nespecially from the widespread diffusion of pay satellite televisions. \n\n Industry has been concentrated very much in manufacturing with a very limited \nnumber of global competitors\u2014the \u201c Prime Contractors \u201d\u2014both in Europe and in the \nUSA. \n\n The entrance of emerging countries into the market should be noted, especially \nChina and India, which have put into place extremely ambitious space plans. \n\n \n\n\n\n49\n\nLaunchers\n9.0\n\nGround segment,\noperation, other\n\n11.6*\n\nSatellite\n11\n\n38.1\n\nCommercial\n5.3\n\nInstitutional\n32.8 (1)\n\nCivil\nMilitary\n\nCommercial\n\nSpace Shuttle\nISS and\nprobes\n\nnavigation\nTLC\n\nDetection\nScience\n\nLaunchers\nLauncher\nservices\n\nIn\ndu\n\nst\nria\n\nl P\nro\n\ncu\nre\n\nm\nen\n\nt +\nin\n\ndu\nst\n\nria\nl R\n\n&\nD\n\nCivil\nMilitary\n\nCommercial\nCivil\n\nMilitary\nCommercial\n\nB\n\n(1)13.2B     of agencies expenses not included\n\n*It includes also services like LEOP.\n\nHuman space flights and\nexplorations\n\n6.5\n\n  Figure 1.46.

(Press release source, \nFinmeccanica SpA elaboration source).       \n\nSpace Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\n This constitutes a high competitive factor for European industry, which unlike the \nUSA\u2019s market does not bene fi t from an established military market that can provide \nadequate stable support. \n\n For example, in the launcher sector, commercial supply from the Ukraine, Russia, \nand India of vehicles at low cost, even though less reliable at times, is a very competi-\ntive factor for the European Ariane launcher. \n\n The American industrial sector is essentially the world leader, followed by Russia, \nChina, and Europe. \n\n China is becoming an emerging power even in the space sector and after sending \nmen into space has clearly surpassed Europe in industrial capability. However, this \ndoes not mean there is a lack of competent industrial capability in Europe but rather \na lack of funding dedicated to this sector. \n\n India is an autonomous space power that can realize satellites and launchers and \nis emerging on the commercial market. Canada has developed a signi fi cant space \nindustry that bene fi ts from excellent relations with both the USA and Europe. Japan \nhas developed a major industrial sector centered on scienti fi c research and planetary \nexploration. Israel has developed autonomous capability for realizing telecommuni-\ncation and Earth observation satellites for defense purposes. \n\n In conclusion, the space market is undergoing signi fi cant development and an \nincreasing number of countries are developing satellite tools for establishing an \nindustrial base, which can provide them with strategic industrial capabilities. \n\n Figure  1.46  presents an overview of the volume of estimated business for so-called \nindustrial  \u201cprocurement \u201d for 2008, the value of orders acquired from the major indus-\ntries for the sector, while Figure  1.47  illustrates the turnover of the  Prime Contractors  \nin 2009. \n\n Figure  1.48  presents the 2009 turnover from major second-tier companies (main \n Sub-Contractors ) of the manufacturing pyramid, that is, the ones that can supply \nsubsystems integrated to the \u201c Prime Contractors .\u201d \n\n \n\n\n\n50\n\n  Figure 1.47.

Loral Space & Communications, for \nexample, only produces one type of telecommunications satellite it sells to commer-\ncial operators throughout the world. \n\n The main  Prime Contractors , on the other hand, have a variety of products \nand therefore a varied product offer, from satellites to launchers to space \ninfrastructures. \n\n The current industrial scenario is the result of a series of mergers which occurred \nin the 1990s and 2000s, which reduced the number of \u201c Prime Contractors \u201d by about \n30 to only 10/12 companies in the world and the merger process is probably not over, \nespecially in Europe.  \n\n      The Services and Applications Market \n\n Space services are based on the use of telecommunication, Earth observation, and \nradio-navigation and localization satellites, in addition to scienti fi c services from \nspace science missions. \n\n Satellites on which the supply of services is based are almost always complex and \ncostly and operators are usually civilian or military institutions. \n\n However, a bustling market for satellite services has developed in telecommunica-\ntions and many operators have developed in the world, for the most part private or as \na result of privatizations, which offer satellite linkup for telephones, television, or \ndata exchange on the market. \n\n In the Earth observation sector, public operators dominate, while in positioning \nand navigation there has been a true boom in GPS terminal diffusion for automobile \nor private use (e.g., mobile phones). \n\n Scienti fi c missions, on the other hand, are public in nature and are government \nfunded. \n\n Therefore, space services can be subdivided as follows. \n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\n  Figure 1.50.

(Press release \nsource, Companies Annual Reports source, Finmeccanica SpA elaboration source).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n In the telecommunication sector the world global market is characterized by \n oligopolies. There are few global operators (SES Global, Intelsat, and Eutelsat) and \nmany small operators on local markets. \n\n Figure  1.53  presents the turnover of the major satellite telecommunication opera-\ntors in the world, including several companies active in manufacturing terminals \n(e.g., Garmin, Gilat, and Viasat). In fact, Garmin, which is the  fi rst, realizes hardware \nand terminals for GPS receiving systems, but does not operate a  fl eet of satellites as \ndoes instead Intelsat, SES, and Eutelsat for example. \n\n Figure  1.54  shows how 61% of the transmission channels offered by geostationary \nsatellites are owned by the  fi rst four world operators, while the remaining 39% are \nowned by local operators distributed in regions (e.g., Russia or East or South Asia) \nwhere the  fi rst four are less present. However, basic data show that, compared to the \n fi rst years of the 2000s, there are many more commercial operators today. \n\n \n\n\n\n55\n\n  Figure 1.54.

Major operators of satellite imaging in the world.       \n\nSpace Activities: A Peculiar Economical, Political, and Industrial Sector \n\n Figure  1.57  shows us a list of the main satellite imaging operators in the world. \n Included among these, we see only the two American operators, Geoeye Inc. and \n\nDigital Globe Inc., had returns in 2010 a little over 300 million USD, while the other \ncompanies generally have returns less than 10 million. This is due to the number and \ntype of satellites available in order, which is to the resolution of the remote sensing \ninstrument. \n\n \n\n\n\n58\n\n  Figure 1.58.     Estimated 2009\u20132018 sales of satellite images. (Press release source, \nFinmec canica SpA elaboration source).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n Figure  1.58  shows an estimate of the promising market from the sale of satellite \nimages in the near future, which includes commercial sales and sales for government \nuse, of optical and radar images. \n\n In the navigation and info-mobility segment, the main target markets remain aero-\nnautics and personal mobility (automobiles and mobile phones). The entrance of \nthird-generation GPS satellites into service, the European Galileo satellites and the \nrenewal of the Russian Glonass  fl eet should lead to a substantial reduction in costs \nfor devices and related services. Moreover, it is foreseen that the new guidelines of \nthe European Union for standardization of the speci fi cations will allow the targeted \nmarkets to take off. \n\n The market trend for the SOP sector (Satellite Operators), which includes putting \ncommercial satellites into orbit and their maintenance, has been forecast as being \nstable for the future, while new opportunities for managing the satellite  fl eets for \n\u201cdual\u201d use are predicted.                                                                  \n\n \n\n\n\n59\n\n         Program management has to ensure the success of a project, and therefore this is the \nmain objective of the management team. Success is based on the industrial project \nand on maintaining commitments made in terms of cost estimates, maintaining time \nschedules and achieving results. \n\n Program management involves all the methods and tools of project management. \nIt can be de fi ned as a vast range of human expertise. This book limits itself to space \nprojects, which, due to their special nature, are essentially complex and of long \nduration. \n\n The mistake most often made is thinking that management methods and tools can \nbe acquired during the development of the project itself. This almost always leads to \nestimation errors and has a negative impact on the program. \n\n Since ultimately every industrial program is essentially a human activity, and \nhumans are at the center of the \u201cman-technique-market\u201d trio which pervades a proj-\nect, and for this reason these management techniques evolve with man\u2019s social, \nindustrial, and behavioral development. \n\n Therefore, management is not an exact and unchangeable science. Generally, it \ncan be broken down into four basic types of actions: \n\n  Planning : These activities are aimed at studying and preparing documents for \n establishing objectives and requirements within expected time frames. Afterwards, \ndevelopment plans are communicated. \n\n  Organization : These activities are aimed at adapting production structures to achieve \nobjectives, to divide work into subsystems to reduce the overall complexity of the \nproject, and to make work ef fi cient. \n\n  Coordinating : These activities are aimed at directing, informing, and communicating \nwithin the structures involved, coordinating work and providing motivation. \n\n  Control : These activities are aimed at establishing rules and procedures which \n measure the results achieved through time so that there is an awareness of possible \ndifferences between what was achieved and what was expected to be realized at that \ntime (   Figure  2.1 ). \n\n    Chapter 2   \n\n Space Program Management       \n\nM.

Basic management methodology  fl owchart.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n    2.1.   Characteristics of Space Programs \n\n For the most part, a space program is a major project for:\n\n    1.    The development, realization, putting into orbit, and use of space systems, such as \nsatellites, scienti fi c satellites or orbiting infrastructures, with the aim of ful fi lling \nthe aims of the mission for which the systems were designed.  \n\n    2.    The development, realization and testing in  fl ight of a launch system (i.e., a space \nlauncher) which can put a payload (i.e., the space system referred to in point 1) into \norbit.     \n\n Therefore, a space program has speci fi c characteristics based on the type of mis-\nsion to be performed. These characteristics in fl uence the speci fi cations and decision-\nmaking process involved in the realization process from its conception. \n\n It is important to de fi ne a space program through an analysis of its main charac-\nteristics which can be summarized thusly:\n\n   Strategic importance  \u2022 \n  Extent of international participation  \u2022 \n  Speci fi c industrial and specialized sector  \u2022 \n  Signi fi cantly high investment cost  \u2022 \n\n \n\n\n\n61Space Program Management\n\n  Long-term time frame program  \u2022 \n  Rapid development, obsolescence, of the technologies used  \u2022 \n  Impossibility of intervening in space for repairs and/or maintenance  \u2022 \n  Use, which is often incorrectly understood and scarcely perceived outside of the \u2022 \nframework of the speci fi c sectors    \n\n      Strategic Importance \n\n The space sector, in addition to civilian applications, is unquestionably linked with \nmilitary requirements and applications because of its history and constant technological \ndevelopment advancement. \n\n The ability of satellites to  fl y beyond borders and their ability to connect people in \ndifferent continents without using on-ground infrastructures are only two of the many \nreasons for their strategic and military features. \n\n A nation\u2019s capability, or a group of nations such as Europe, to be able to design, \nrealize, and launch space programs is an essential requirement in the third millennium \nin order to be respected politically and economically at the global level. \n\n This capability is expressed in two technological areas: autonomy of access to space \n(ability to use one\u2019s own launcher from their homeland) and satellite technology avail-\nability. This can be traduced in having an industrial sector capable to design and build \nautonomously launchers and satellites platforms, as well as electronics on-board. \nWithout this technological autonomy, a nation cannot consider itself a space \u201cpower.\u201d  \n\n     Extent of International Participation \n\n Quite often, because of its industrial and economic scope, a space program is imple-\nmented in the framework of international cooperation. In addition, a space program \noperates in extra-atmospheric space and therefore the entire human community can \nbe involved both negatively and positively. \n\n It should be pointed out that when space technologies began in the 1950s and \n1960s, the programs were developed exclusively on a one-nation basis, in the USA \nand the former Soviet Union. Since there was a strategic, political, and military com-\npetition between the two blocks (West and Soviet) behind all programs, space was \nmainly a theater for tactical confrontation. \n\n There has always been a spirit of collaboration among nations since the 1960s in Europe \nand the creation of the European Space Agency (ESA) is a proof of this. The Member States \nare committed to creating a supranational organization charged with developing space pro-\ngrams for peaceful purposes, that is, for knowledge and the common good. \n\n Obviously, ESA has not stopped the national space agencies of the major Member \nStates, France, Germany, and Italy, which altogether have contributed approximately \n60% of ESA\u2019s budget, by designing and realizing nationally based or bi-multilateral-\nbased programs. \n\n However, what is brought to the forefront of discussion in this book is space\u2019s inter-\nnational character which is not only political and dimensional, but also technical. \n\n The international aspect is already signi fi cant during the technical de fi nition of a \nspace program: the fallout of a launcher\u2019s stages in the sea or on land, the reentry of \nsatellites into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere (or the Space Shuttle), global coordination of \n\n\n\n62 Space Program Management\n\nthe use of radio-electrical frequencies for satellite transmission and reception, \ncrowding and overcrowding of orbital spaces on local or global geographical areas, \nlimitations on the use of onboard satellites of radioisotope power generators, limitations \non the coverage from space of geographical areas with radio-electric emissions. \n\n All of these technical aspects give a limited idea of the international characteristics \nof a space program. \n\n The international aspect of a space program is very often also stressed by the need \nto share the high costs which cannot be afforded by single nations. \n\n     Specific and Specialized Industrial Sector \n\n From the beginning, the realization of space systems has been the prerogative of \ndedicated industries which during the course of many years have developed speci fi c \ncompetences and their own development means. \n\n This has globally brought about the creation of an industry in the broadest sense \nof the word, a unit of scienti fi c and industrial entities highly focused and specialized. \n\n This has to some extent prevented the development of a major synergy in the past \nbetween the space, aeronautical or electronic industries. However, now there is a \nmajor transfer of expertise and resources among those areas. \n\n There continues to be speci fi c industrial feature of the space sector, which highly \nde fi nes the specialization. For example, still nowadays CPUs derived from old tech-\nnology processors are installed on commercial television broadcast satellites. New \nCPUs such as the ones equipping home or of fi ce computers could be much more \nef fi cient; however since they must function in extra-atmospheric conditions, the \nquali fi cation and testing process is such a high-level and specialized requirement that \nthe industrial speci fi city has been maintained and is evolving slowly. \n\n     Significantly High Investment Cost \n\n A space program\u2019s cost is always a major investment, whether it is funded by public \nfunds or private capital. \n\n In the  fi rst case, investments come from space agency\u2019s budgets, while in the \nsecond case the capital is from commercial and private companies that are investing \nfor a pro fi t. \n\n For example, let\u2019s examine the Ariane 5 program, selected by ESA in 1985. This \nprogram was supposed to conceive and realize the European launcher of the twenty-\n fi rst century. When it was  fi rst launched in 1996, the program had cost 6 billion euro \nand had been completely funded by ESA with public funds. Since the  fi rst launch \nfailed, more years and billions of euro were needed to achieve a testing con fi guration \nof the launcher during the  fi rst part of the 2000s. \n\n The initial decision to undertake these programs, however, was full of not easily \nforeseeable consequences and could only be taken at the highest level of government. \nIn fact, the highest decision-making body for ESA is the Ministerial Council where \nthe Research Ministers of the Member States are seated and commit their respective \ngovernments with their decisions to fund ESA\u2019s programs on a multi-year basis. \n\n On the other hand, decisions are taken by the Board of Directors of the companies \nwhich intend to start up a space program for pro fi t in the case of private commercial \nconcerns. \n\n\n\n63Space Program Management\n\n This is why the manufacture, launch and operations of a television broadcasting \nsatellite can last 15 years and can cost a minimum of 200 million to a maximum of \n500 million euro, depending on the satellite\u2019s size and the number of transponders it \ncontains. \n\n Another example is the private commercial initiatives involving telephone com-\nmunications satellites that were realized in the 1990s, Iridium and Globalstar for \nexample, which cost private investors up to 9 billion euro. \n\n The large amount of investment required is because a space program is so complex \nthat it involves many partners at all levels and requires specialized industries which \nonly  fi ve or six countries in the world possess. \n\n     Long-Term Time Frame Program \n\n Generally, it takes more than 10 years between the  fi rst preliminary studies on a space \nsystem and the end of operational services and sometimes, in the case of launchers or \nthe International Space Station (ISS), even more than 20 years. \n\n Sometimes the development of satellites, for example European weather satellites, \ncan last 20 years before evolving to the subsequent generations. The American satel-\nlite system Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation and localization, began \nits  fi rst feasibility studies in the 1970s and became operational during the  fi rst war in \nthe Persian Gulf in 1991. In 2008, the American Defense Department began the \ndevelopment of third-generation GPS satellites to ensure both the renewal and evolu-\ntion of the system. \n\n From these and other examples, the importance of outlook and vision when under-\ntaking a space program is understood. This is also necessary because sometimes it is \ndif fi cult to be aware at the start-up of broader uses of the system. \n\n     Rapid Development, Obsolescence, of the Technologies Used \n\n The technologies used for space programs have evolved extraordinarily in the last 40 \nyears. Astronauts of the Apollo Moon missions of the 1960s did not have the computing \ncapability on board their spacecraft, which is now available in a Personal Communication \nDevice, such as a notebook, or laptop or multifunction cellular phone. \n\n The onboard software of the Moon-landing module used about 20,000 lines of \ninstructions. Today, any smart-phone contains software with millions of lines of \ninstructions. \n\n For this reason the choice of technologies used in space program missions remains \nan exercise in caution and balance since the directions taken will in fl uence the pro-\ngram during its entire operational life. \n\n The technological level acquired at any given point in time can in fl uence the \nchoice of a space program in at least two obvious cases:\n\n   A technology which is not immediately available but only after a research and \u2022 \ndevelopment phase could be a handicap to the development of well-identi fi ed \napplications.  \n  On the other hand, a technological advancement could have a  fl ywheel effect for \u2022 \na program with a greater future outlook for its applications.    \n\n\n\n64 Space Program Management\n\n     Impossibility of Intervening in Space for Repairs and/or Maintenance \n\n Despite the promises of the past decades to operate in space in an \u201cordinary\u201d way, \nthis is still not the case. Therefore, 99% of the time it is impossible to repair a break-\ndown which occurs while the satellite is in orbit. \n\n The remaining 1% possibility is for very special missions such as NASA\u2019s Hubble \nspace telescope which was repaired in orbit by American astronauts. Once they \nreached the Space Shuttle at over 600 km in altitude they repaired it, performing the \nnecessary modi fi cations to restore focal balance to the lenses, every 8 or 9 years. \nHowever, the mission was complex and costly and was only carried out because \nHubble\u2019s orbit could be reached and it cannot be overlooked that billions of dollars \ninvested by NASA would have been wasted once the focusing defect of the lenses \nwas noted soon after the start-up of the space telescope\u2019s operation. \n\n Obviously, this case is quite out of the ordinary, in addition since the Space Shuttle \nhas been phased out in 2011 no one will reach the Hubble Space Telescope anymore. \n\n In the case of commercial telecommunication satellites which orbit at 36,000 km \naltitude, any attempt at repair or maintenance to date can theoretically be done but \noperationally has never been developed. \n\n Minimizing breakdowns is reduced with in- fl ight experience of pre-operational \nsatellites or during testing, whenever possible, in order to learn how to improve the \nproduction process on ground. \n\n     Use, Which Is Often Incorrectly Understood and Scarcely \nPerceived Outside of the Framework of the Specific Sectors \n\n Despite the growing importance of the uses derived from space systems in the last \n40 years, the potential bene fi ts from this sector often remain misunderstood not only \nby a large number of people who are not involved in making them, but also sometime \nby politicians in charge who are ultimately the ones to decide on the amount of public \ninvestment to be made in the sector. \n\n In several sectors such as telecommunications or weather satellites, the use of \nsatellites has become an integral part of the means used by public institutions or busi-\nnesses and the public realize their need because of the direct advantage they bene fi t \nfrom (for example, satellite pay TV used by millions of European citizens and the \nworld know the advantages of satellites). \n\n The recent boom in the spread of GPS satellite navigators for cars and cellular \nphones has further drawn the public to an awareness of the use of space systems, but \nmany of them still do not understand their use. \n\n Space systems for Earth observation, for example, whose technological development \nis constantly growing, are certainly understood and used by public institutions such as \nmilitary authorities, but other government agencies still do not know they could use the \nservices provided by these systems for managing the territory, coasts, agriculture or for \nother socially useful aspects. \n\n Space systems for cosmology or the study of the universe have always fascinated \nthe public because the discoveries they make have the magic of bringing man closer \nto the fascinating mysteries of the stars and planets. Too often, however, this fascina-\ntion is only accessed sporadically at the time of a certain media event which will \nremain locked in the restricted circle of the scienti fi c community. It is also true that \n\n\n\n65Space Program Management\n\nthe scienti fi c discoveries of space systems of the past 30 years have allowed us to \nrevolutionize and broaden our knowledge of the solar system as man has never been \nable to do in the past centuries. \n\n An age-old debate on whether or not to develop programs with astronauts to orbit \naround the Earth, towards the Moon or Mars, rather than send robotic probes is also \npart of this misunderstanding of space programs. \n\n The most widespread obstacle concerns the fact that beyond the strategic or politi-\ncal needs of a nation to af fi rm their own technological superiority by sending men \ninto space (which was the basis for NASA\u2019s Apollo Moon program), there have been \nno signi fi cant technological advantages or knowledge to date on sending men into \nspace compared to the enormously less expensive achievements of satellites or \nrobotic problems. \n\n There is no one clear answer to this debate which remains animated but incom-\nplete, and certainly space agencies should make an effort to spread knowledge about \nthe space sector to the greater public, but with an awareness of the possible advantages \nof these technologies, as well as their limits, it has the unknown elements and risks \nwhich are present in many other human activities.  \n\n    2.2.   Methods of De fi ning and Managing Space Programs \n\n Because of its nature and obvious destination, a space program is aimed at realizing \na space mission. \n\n The necessary industrial products to be realized for this are:\n\n   Launchers, either reusable and expendable satellites or space probes.  \u2022 \n  Space infrastructures, such as the ISS.  \u2022 \n  Orbiting vehicles, such as, for example, ESA\u2019s Automated Transfer Vehicle ATV.  \u2022 \n  Space planes, for example Scaled Composite\u2019s SpaceShip which Virgin Galactic \u2022 \nintends to commercialize tourist  fl ights in the  fi rst layers of extra-atmospheric space.    \n\n Because of its size, a space program is generally an industrial program whose \nrealization is the result of many technologies which altogether form a  system , built by \nmany industrial participants who make up an  industrial group . \n\n In complex space programs, the industrial group is then legally and industrially \nrepresented by a sole industry called the  Prime Contractor  which becomes the only \ninterface with the customer to supply the product. \n\n The combination of these two components which characterize a space program \nmakes for a generally complex and risky enterprise, whose costs and duration have \nhighly variable project parameters despite estimates and accurate forecasts during the \ndesign phase. \n\n Clearly, these two parameters are intrinsically related not only to technological but \nalso to the political, strategic, and economic aspects of a space project. \n\n Every space program is divided into two macro areas for its development and \noperations:\n\n    1.    The space segment  \n    2.    The ground segment     \n\n\n\n66 Space Program Management\n\n The space segment is physically the vehicle which  fl ies into space; the ground \nsegment is made up of equipment on ground during the operational life of the pro-\ngram for use on the space segment (for example, reception terminals for television \nprograms or satellite navigators for cars), or to control spacecraft (for example, satel-\nlite stations for telemetry and remote control). \n\n The link for realizing the two segments of a space program is the system activity. \n Therefore, the term system can be broadly de fi ned as the capability of managing \n\nthe realization of a space program through engineering and is an essential component \nfor already multiple competences required ranging from technical to economic and \neven human resources.  \n\n    2.3.   Implementing Space Programs \n\n A space program includes two main phases and a start-up decision is taken in the \nmiddle of the program:\n\n    1.    The phase at the beginning: identi fi cation and conception of the mission, including \nthe analysis of products/technologies to be used and the various cost/time estimations.  \n\n    2.    The phase after the decision: the development and installation of the system.     \n\n      Program De fi nition \n\n In the  fi rst period the mission is identi fi ed and therefore the requirements to be \nsatis fi ed are drawn down (for example, the realization of a new cryogenic propulsion \nmotor to increase the performance of a launcher to maintain competitiveness on the \nmarket). \n\n In the  fi rst phase it is crucial to identify the preliminary project, that is to say the \nconception of space technologies/products to use, if in existence, or to be developed, \nif they are not available, to implement the mission. \n\n In Figure  2.2 , an example of requirements matrix is given which basically reports \nthe subsystems and essential systems to be considered during the processing of the \npreliminary project. \n\n The starting point is a preliminary industrial project to implement a program, \ni.e., the analysis of a development plan of a mission which identi fi es the necessary \nproducts, associated risks, available technology and technology to be developed \n(which enter into the associated risks category), industrial competences to involve, \nestimate of development time and realization costs. \n\n The decision-making context for implementing the program is therefore essential. \nThe most wide-ranging political, economic, strategic socio-cultural, industrial and \nscienti fi c and other factors can in fl uence the decision whether or not to start up a \nspace program, be it government-funded or commercial. \n\n In each case, once the elements of the project and the decision-making context are \nanalyzed, what happens next is the negotiation phase, i.e., the phase needed to con-\nvince the customer to decide to invest in the program. \n\n Generally, innovation is almost always essential for the positive acceptance of a \nspace program and an innovative mission can ful fi ll new needs and requirements such \n\n\n\n67\n\nSYSTEM\nSystem engineering\nProject control\nQuality assurance\nIntegration & Test\nOperations\n\nGROUND SEGMENT\nOperations\nTT & C\nLogistics\nMaintenance\n\nSPACE SEGMENT\nStructures & Mechanism\nAerodynamics\n\nThermal\nAerothermal\nPropulsion\nNavigation\nGuidance\nControl\nOrbital Attitude Control\nPower Generation\n\nFotovolthaic\nChemical\nThermal\n\nPower Supply\nOn Board Computer\nTT & C\n\nLAUNCHERS\n\nSATELLITES\n\nSPACE MANNED ORBITAL STATIONS\n\nMANNED REUSABLE SPACECRAFTS\n\nSPACE UNMANNED ORBITAL VEHICLES\n\n  Figure 2.2.    Example of requirements and needs matrix.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\nas increasing already existing availabilities in order to reach new levels of technology \n(for example, increasing a launcher\u2019s performance through the introduction of new \npropulsion technologies). On the other hand, however, the innovation component is \nalso the bearer of future technological development risks and use risks. \n\n For example, the realization of an onboard antenna for a large low-frequency satel-\nlite, over ten/ fi fteen meters, can be a commercial advantage for the future managers \nof the satellite in terms of greater number of users who can be reached by the service. \nHowever, it could also cause delay risks in the development or worse yet, malfunc-\ntioning during its operational life if the antenna technology has not been previously \ntested by the industry called upon to realize it. \n\n \n\n\n\n68 Space Program Management\n\n Since a space program is frequently the original integration of new technologies, \nits success depends on the correct de fi nition of the mission\u2019s speci fi cations which \nmust be applied in an extremely accurate manner. Its success also relies on the correct \nidenti fi cation of industrial products to be developed whose technologically innova-\ntive contribution must be appraised carefully and realistically through the forecast of \ndevelopment risks. It also depends on the correct de fi nition of the program\u2019s organi-\nzation, its duration and costs. \n\n The process which identi fi es levels of technological risk with the use of products/\ncomponents of a space system is called \u201cTRL scale\u201d where TRL is the acronym of \n\u201cTechnology Readiness Level.\u201d TRL is a methodology for measuring the technological \nmaturity of a component or product, including the  fi nal subsystem element. This \nmeasurement is essential for understanding the level of technological risk to which \nthe system is subject. \n\n The TRL scale is made up of nine levels:\n\n   TRL 1: Transition of a system derived from pure scienti fi c research to application \nresearch. Describes the essential features of a system in basics through mathemati-\ncal formulae or algorithms.  \n\n  TRL 2: Applied research. The theory and basic scienti fi c principles of technology are \nfocused on an application area and the analytical instruments for simulation are \ndeveloped.  \n\n  TRL 3: Validation of \u201cproof of concept,\u201d testing a model of the system to be realized \nis functioning. Research and development are implemented with analysis and \nlaboratory studies. Technical feasibility is demonstrated by developing models \nwhose representation of the  fi nal product is still incomplete.  \n\n  TRL 4: Realization of prototypes and tests. Testing is therefore performed on scale \nmodels that are almost fully representative of the  fi nal one.  \n\n  TRL 5: Validation of the integrated prototype with veri fi cation testing of the \nspeci fi cations in an environment which represents the future operational environ-\nment as much as possible.  \n\n  TRL 6: The prototype is developed in \u201cfull-scale\u201d and the engineering feasibility is \ntested with application tests that represent the operational environment.  \n\n  TRL 7: The prototype is tested in an operational environment (or highly realistic one) \nwith a detailed series of tests. The documentation of the technology produced \nassumes an established form with the corroboration of testing.  \n\n  TRL 8: A quali fi ed  fl ight system through testing or demonstrations in operational \nenvironment (on ground or already in space). The relative documentation is com-\nplete both for training and for eventual maintenance.  \n\n  TRL 9: The so-called \u201cmission proven\u201d system\u2014that is, already used in operational \nand application environments in space and has demonstrated its effectiveness with \na successful operational experience.    \n\n The TLR scale is therefore essential in de fi ning the program since it allows us to \ndetermine which and how many products, components or subsystems to be used \ncould need innovative developments or not. \n\n Just as important is the preliminary evaluation to measure of integration of the  fi nal \nsystem to be realized. Whether it is a satellite, a launcher or a robotic system to be sent \nto another planet, or even a technologically relevant subsystem, the measurement scale \n\n\n\n69\n\n9\nFlight proven\n\n5\nSystem launched and operational\n\n8\nFlight qualified\n\n4\nPrototype /Demonstartor under \n\nrelevant test simulating flight\n\n7\nPrototype in operational \n\nenvironment 3\nModel or prototype \nunder ground test\n\n6\nDemo of prototype in relevant\n\nenvironment 2\nDetailed System Analysis\n\n5\nValidation of model in relevant\n\nenvironment 1\nSystem Concept Analysis\n\n4\nValidation of model \n\n(breadboard) in laboratory\n\n3\nProof of concept\n\n2\nTechnological concept\n\n1\nPrinciples\n\n  Figure 2.3.    Comparison of the TLR and ILR scale.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\nof the IRL\u2014Integration Readiness Level\u2014supplies an important instrument for \nunderstanding the level of dif fi culty connected to realizing the determined system. \n\n In the same way as the TLR, the ILR also is made up of various scales\u2014 fi ve\u2014\nwhich indicate the degree of technological con fi dence:\n\n   ILR 1: corresponds to a system where the concept of the whole has been completed  \n  ILR 2: corresponds to a system where the detailed project has been completed  \n  ILR 3: corresponds to a prototype (or a demonstrator called a mock-up) subject to \n\non-ground testing  \n  ILR 4: corresponds to a prototype (or a mock-up) subject to testing simulating  fl ight  \n  ILR 5: corresponds to an operational system, manufactured and already launched    \n\n NASA, which introduced the ILR level concepts in 2002, then began modifying \nthem to arrive at a scale of 9 ILR, forming a metric standard called SRL or System \nReadiness Level which is still in consolidation phase. \n\n Figure  2.3  shows the relationship between the TLR and ILR scales. \n Just like most industrial and economic operations, even the development of a space \n\nprogram must, directly or indirectly, lead to an economic objective, such as a return on \ninvestment. This is obviously true for private programs with  fi nancial objectives, such \nas commercial telecommunications missions, but generally speaking the same principle \nshould hold true for publically funded space projects (such as the ISS). \n\n \n\n\n\n70 Space Program Management\n\n More realistically, in these cases very often the objective is mainly industrial \nstrategy and government geo-policy, in which case  fi nancial objectives are not \nnecessarily the priority. This leads to undertaking technological risks which are \noften a characteristic of the agency government programs.  \n\n      Realization of the Program \n\n In the second phase of realization and implementation, there are the activities related to:\n\n   Negotiation and signature with the customer of a contract in which the customer \u2022 \ncarefully establishes the objectives to be achieved to the industrial group or Prime \nContractor.  \n  De fi nition of a document called the \u201cManagement Plan,\u201d which is a reference \u2022 \nguidelines for the program manager for all development levels, the realization, the \nimplementation and the achievement of the objectives established by the contract.  \n  Management, which is a dynamic and continuous activity of control and guidance \u2022 \nof various development phases.    \n\n The contract is signed after negotiation between the industrial group and the cus-\ntomer standing a technical-economic proposal by the group. This proposal usually \nfollows a request for proposals, drawn up and sent by the customer to various poten-\ntial suppliers. \n\n The contract establishes the objectives which are:\n\n   Technical: observance of speci fi cations, external interfaces, performance and qual-\u2022 \nity of the product to be supplied.  \n  Temporal: observance of delivery time indicated in the contract during all realiza-\u2022 \ntion phases.  \n  Financial: observance of costs indicated in the contract and payment plan which \u2022 \nnormally follow the time delivery plan.    \n Should one or more of the objectives not be achieved, whether it be the  fi nal \n\ndelivery or the intermediate one, the contract generally includes a penalty to the \nindustrial group. Generally, these penalties are  fi nancial in nature and are incurred \nwhen these three objectives are not reached. \n\n Technical noncompliance, failure to observe one or more of the technical objectives \nof the contract, leads to delays in delivery and cost overruns, which are extra expenses \nfor achieving satisfactory objectives. The costs not included in the contract are mon-\netized by the customer as a reduction of the  fi nal cost, or if the  fi nal cost does not vary, \nthe industrial group must bear the cost. If the Management Plan has not adequately \nforeseen, the  fi nancial objectives of the industrial group, the program will be nega-\ntively affected. \n\n Time noncompliance, which is the delays in the delivery schedule, do result not \nonly from technical noncompliance, but also from a lack of supplies or the inadequate \nestimate of development time. In each case, the  fi nancial fallout will result in a reduc-\ntion of the  fi nal price paid. Financial noncompliance obviously includes the cost \noverruns caused by the two noncompliances just mentioned. \n\n As stated previously, if the customer does not accept variations to the contract, \nwith possible industrial compensation on the customer\u2019s other programs, the indus-\ntrial group must take on the cost overruns. \n\n\n\n71Space Program Management\n\n However, if technical noncompliances, being one or more of the technical objectives \nindicated in the contract, are a result of the customer\u2019s modi fi cations and not foreseen \nin the contract, then the contract is renegotiated and monetized as an increase in the \n fi nal price. \n\n In addition to the contract, the other main management tool is the \u201cManagement \nPlan,\u201d which is the reference document for developing and realizing the program. \nEvery space program requires for almost all its elements, a demonstration of progress \nwith time, on ground and a complete compliance of the product with the speci fi cations \nof the contract and in general with its space mission. \n\n These demonstrations are theoretical, that is to say numerical analysis and simula-\ntions, and representational, and achieved through bench tests. \n\n Both types of demonstrations represent for the entire space program lifetime, tests \nfor implementing the product which once it reaches space cannot be changed, main-\ntained or repaired should it fail to perform properly (except for variations in software \nwhich can be modi fi ed on ground). \n\n This development approach is laborious and systematic in a space program and \nmust be speci fi ed in the Management Plan since the product\u2019s functions cannot be \nreproduced on ground under the same conditions it will be required to operate. \nPractically speaking, you cannot reproduce the space environment on ground to test \nall the integrated system as well as the various subsystems. However, thoroughness \nin the quality of realization, de fi nition and conducting of tests on ground is essential \nfor ensuring the program\u2019s success. \n\n The detailed Management Plan is an outcome of the technical de fi nition of the \nproduct, the \u201cMake-or-Buy\u201d process of the development plan, i.e., what to make inside \nthe industrial group or what outsource, and when to test and qualify the product. \n\n The Management Plan is based on a three-part breakdown, whose topology must \nbe consistent, made up of:\n\n   A technical three, which is the technical breakdown of the overall system in sub-\u2022 \nsystems and equipment.  \n  A contract three, which is the breakdown, for example, of the main contract of the \u2022 \nPrime Contractor in the subcontracts of lower level suppliers up to basic-level \nelements.  \n  A timetable plan, which is a breakdown in linked phases with all the elements \u2022 \nmaking up the elements, subsystems and lastly the overall system.    \n\n The elementary module of activities, named elementary Task or Work Package, is \nlocated in this last component of the Management Plan. \n\n The Management Plan identi fi es the drawing up of various reference documents \nfor each contractual stage or level:\n\n   Speci fi cations  \u2022 \n  Development and Realization Plan  \u2022 \n  Task Description  \u2022 \n  Control Plan Quality  \u2022 \n  Con fi guration Plan  \u2022 \n  Time Schedule Plan  \u2022 \n  Budget Plan    \u2022 \n\n\n\n72\n\nManagement Plan\n\n1.

General structure of a Management Plan for a telecommunication satellite.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n Figure  2.4  provides a general chart of a Management Plan for a telecommunica-\ntions satellite. \n\n With the Management Plan the program managers have at their disposal a \n systematic tool for controlling the progress of the program and for managing it \n properly with the aim of achieving the speci fi ed objectives through:\n\n \n\n\n\n73Space Program Management\n\n   Continuous control, also in real time, of the differences for the realization in \u2022 \n progress, measured appropriately, and the state of development foreseen by the \nManagement Plan at that time.  \n  The analysis of the reasons for these differences up to the manager level for basic \u2022 \nequipment.  \n  The analysis of appropriate corrective actions, the fastest, most effective and \u2022 \n economical for putting the means and actions into place for eliminating these \n differences, for example reorganizing the plan, mobilizing other resources, or \nusing program margins.  \n  Updating the Management Plan for complying with development reality and phase \u2022 \nit correctly with subsequent control.    \n\n Performance, timetable, and costs are closely linked in program management \nthrough the industry\u2019s internal mechanisms. It follows that all increases in performance \nor quality generate delays or cost overruns and all delays generate cost overruns. \n\n This concept must be understood not only for realization beyond contract \nspeci fi cations, but also for a realization which during production seems so successful \nthat the program managers increase its performance in their eagerness to do well. \n\n Increase in costs is de fi nitely the most characteristic and speci fi c overall measure \nof a space program\u2019s \u201cstate of disorder.\u201d  \n\n      Program Constraints \n\n The management of a space program is carried out within a tight network of constraints, \nthat is to say obligations and limitations which must be constantly kept into consider-\nation by the program\u2019s managers. Several of these constraints and obligations are \nspeci fi c to every space mission; others are generally applicable to all space programs. \n\n      Speci fi c Constraints \n The de fi nition of the mission and ultimately of the product conceived for its  realization \nare determined not only by contract performance obligations of time and cost, but also \nby limitations on the available marginstechnically, temporally, and  fi nancially. \n\n Margins are variations of nominal project parameters, in which a system, subsys-\ntem or device still function properly. \n\n The consistency of these margins can be reduced under overall budget obligations; \nfor example, an industrial group is competing with another industrial group for real-\nizing a program. In this case, the  fi nal price proposed to the customer can be dictated \nby business logic for obtaining the contract and in order to reduce the prices the pro-\ngram\u2019s margins may be tightened. \n\n In the absence of program margins, or with reduced margins, the management of \nthe program on the determined objectives is almost always unsuccessful. \n\n The technical margins are a result of the state-of-the-art technologies used in the \nprogram and of the competences acquired by the industrial group. Obviously, the \ngreater are the two, the greater the technical margins of the program. \n\n The lack of technical margins de fi nitely harms the product\u2019s quality and compro-\nmises the mission\u2019s success. The development risks of the lack of margins make it \ndif fi cult to forecast adequately for time and costs. \n\n\n\n74 Space Program Management\n\n The lack of time margins (for example providing for critical equipment in the \nManagement Plan with a 10% delay on the nominal delivery time) or cost margins \n(for example providing for a possible cost overrun on the purchase of critical equip-\nment in the Management Plan) inevitably leads to development noncompliance \nwhich is generally not acceptable without downgrading the equipment supply, \nthereby cutting the program\u2019s development plan. \n\n The result in any case is a highly con fl icting situation between the customer and \nthe industrial group which can have destructive effect on the program itself and can \ncause the failure of the project. \n\n Moreover, the decision is to use risky technologies, unquali fi ed or newly devel-\noped ones, for the de fi ned mission, it is crucial to provide for appropriate margins in \nthe Management Plan as alternative solutions which can be developed in parallel \ndown the line or solutions using quali fi ed technologies.  \n\n      General Constraints \n General limitations apply to all space programs, such as:\n\n   The special characteristics of the space environment\u2014the physical conditions \u2022 \n(zero gravity, cosmic void, solar radiation)\u2014and astrodynamic conditions (Earth\u2019s \nor Moon\u2019s pull).  \n  The characteristics of the industrial group\u2014overall rules and processes typical of \u2022 \nthe space sector (for example, the rule of Just Return in Europe, or exclusive alli-\nances in the business world\u2026.).  \n  The general application rules which concern the sector; for example, the ITAR law \u2022 \nof the US Department of Commerce which since 1998 considers every mechanical \nor electronic equipment made in the USA for onboard space systems, to be an \narmament, limiting the purchase and use by American and non-American indus-\ntrial groups.  \n  Social and professional behaviors. Because of their nature, space programs are \u2022 \nfrequently multinational and for this reason there are permanent problems related \nto national interests that do not always coincide with those of the program itself. \nMoreover, because of their complex and multinational nature, space programs \noften give way to a tendency to spontaneous disorder which is inherent to all col-\nlective human activity, especially the most complicated ones.       \n\n    2.4.   Start-Up of a Space Program \n\n As already stated in Chap.   1    , a space program generally has characteristics such as \ninternational size, major investments, long-term realization (more than a minimum of \n2/3 years) and also long operational time (over 10 years) compared to technological \ndevelopments, the impossibility of repairing in orbit and  fi nally the need of a highly \nspecialized industrial sector. \n\n These elements show the importance of accurate and in-depth preliminary analy-\nses to reach the decision to start up a space program with clear and justi fi ed \nreasons. \n\n The decision-making process is generally as follows (Figure  2.5 ): \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3755-0_1\n\n\n75\n\nINFORMATIONS and DATA\n\nPROGRAM\nREQUIREMENTS\nSTATUS\n\nAVAILABLE LAUNCHER\n\nAVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITION\n\nSELECTION OF RELIABLE  INFORMATIONS\n\nSELECTION\n&\n\nDECISIONS\n\nLOOP\n\nPROGRAM STUDY REPORTS\n\nPROCESS\n\nTHEMATIC ANALYSIS\nECONOMICAL  ANALYSIS\nTECHNICAL ANALYSIS\nPOTENTIAL EXTERNAL \nCOOPERATION\n\n  Figure 2.5.    General chart of decision-making process for a space system project.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n The objective is to establish a project dossier which will be presented to the \ndecision-making bodies. \n\n In the case of the European Space Agency-ESA, the decision-making body is repre-\nsented by the European Research Council of Ministers which safeguards ESA\u2019s activi-\nties. Usually the European Ministers delegate the Presidents of national space agencies \nto represent them in the ESA Council for approving the programs, but every 3 years \nthere are Inter-Ministerial meetings in which the most important dossiers are examined \nand eventually approved at the research ministerial level for European countries. \n\n For private industries or mixed public\u2013private companies, the decision-making \nbody is the Board of Directors. \n\n However, two main phases can be identi fi ed on the writing of the program\u2019s dossier. \n\n    Information \n\nThis involves de fi ning the context of the program proposal:\n\n   The requirement: basically the potential users, and the strategic and/or commercial \u2022 \nmotivations  \n  The state-of-the-art of potential similar programs worldwide  \u2022 \n  The existence or not of a system/platform suitable for developing the space product  \u2022 \n  The existence or not of an available launcher for sending into the required orbit  \u2022 \n  The existence or not of technologies to be used  \u2022 \n  The international and/or commercial competition  \u2022 \n  The existence or not of potentially competitive systems, but not in the space sector \u2022 \n(for example, satellite telephone service versus terrestrial GSM)    \n\n In this  fi rst analysis a set of information data must be reached that is complete, \nselected, and reliable.  \n\n    Definition \n\nIt involves carrying out:\n\n   Thematic studies, to adjust the proposed system to speci fi c requirements of \u2022 \nscienti fi c or application research  \n  Economic studies, i.e., market analysis, return forecasts, technical studies, i.e., \u2022 \nanalysis of the project\u2019s feasibility  \n  Opportunity studies, i.e., strategic analysis concerning the value of the program in \u2022 \na commercial or political framework  \n\n \n\n\n\n76 Space Program Management\n\n  Eventual international cooperation protocols  \u2022 \n  Obtain permission to use determined frequency bands for transmitting and receiv-\u2022 \ning from and towards space    \n\n Through this process various options can be proposed to the decision-making body \non the implementation of a program, the so-called \u201croadmap.\u201d \n\n Therefore, a roadmap is a plan for proposing the implementation of the project. In \nthe following paragraphs the decision-making roadmap is detailed for two characteristic \ntypes of ESA space missions which stand out because of their objectives and partially \nbecause of the decision-making modalities.  \n\n      Scienti fi c Missions \n\n The objectives of a scienti fi c mission is to improve the state of knowledge in a \nresearch domain, such as astronomy, the study of the solar system, Earth science, life \nscience, and the science of materials. \n\n But the improvement of knowledge is not easily quanti fi able as a mere objective, \nand the evaluation of the scienti fi c value of a program and establishment of different \npriorities among various missions which involve various disciplines are extremely \nsensitive responsibilities that must come from the scienti fi c community itself. \n\n The national and international scienti fi c community is made up of professors, \nresearchers, scientists, and industrialists and is a community of competences that \nhave an enormous proactive force. For this reason the programs are selected from \nnumerous mission proposals. \n\n It must also be considered that the selection of a mission, or the type of missions, \ncan have a technological impact, in other terms a return, on the industry which devel-\nops the program in question. Scienti fi c mission can sometimes serve as a testing \nground for future applications. Technological risks are often taken because of the \nspeci fi cities of the missions which require very high performance for their success. \n\n For example, let\u2019s consider the technological returns for an industry which through \na scienti fi c mission plans and develops a communication antenna for an interplane-\ntary probe whose link-up speci fi cations involves distant celestial bodies millions of \nkilometers away; such high project requirements make this product a technological \ntest of enormous impact on all future antennas produced. The technologies developed \ncan give the industry knowledge and a commercial \u201ccompetitive edge\u201d to use in the \nfuture. \n\n For the purpose of the subject of this book, we will refer to scienti fi c missions \nrealized in the framework of the ESA\u2019s Science Directorate activities, and which are \na reference of the activities in Europe for this sector. What is more, scienti fi c activi-\nties were the basis for the creation of ESA itself and are the object of annual obliga-\ntory funding by ESA Member States in proportion to national gross domestic product. \nObviously this process has been fully derived from the NASA science program selec-\ntion process when during the 1970s ESA engineers were heavily cooperating with \ntheir US counterparts to understand how to deal with the space science. \n\n The selection steps for an ESA scienti fi c mission occur according to cycles which \noccur regularly according to the chart in Figure  2.6  and can be generally summarized \nin the following phases:\n\n\n\n77\n\nF\nR\n\nO\nM\n\n 2\n T\n\nO\n 3\n\n Y\nE\n\nA\nR\n\nS\nPROGRAM SELECTION PHASES ACTORS\n\nNUMBER OF\nPROPOSED \nPROJECTS\n\nCALL FOR IDEAS Scientific \n\nCommunity\n>>10\n\nFIRST EVALUATION\n\nWorking Groups\n\nSpace Science \n\nAdvisory \n\nCommittee\n\n~10\n\nFEASIBILITY  \nEVALUATION\n\nScientific \n\nCommunity\n\nESA\n\nIndustry\n\nSELECTION\nScience \nProgram \n\nCommittee\n3 to 5\n\nPHASE \u201cA\u201d DESIGN Industry\n\nPROGRAM SELECTION\nScience \nProgram \n\nCommittee\n1\n\n  Figure 2.6.

But in the last \nfew years even the highest decision-making body of ESA has been involved in programs \nsuch as ExoMars for the exploration of Mars program. This is a result of increasing vari-\nances between the speci fi cations of the mission (issued by the S.P.C.), the estimates for \nthe development of the industry and the real budget possibilities of ESA. \n\n In Figure  2.7  the roles of various Working Groups are clari fi ed better and their \nbreakdown, for the obligatory scienti fi c program (astronomy and solar system).  \n\n      Application Missions \n\n The space applications usually include telecommunications, Earth observation and \nweather forecasting, navigation and satellite localization. In each case they can be \ndivided into two main categories. \n\n      Operational Missions \n These are space missions where the use of related technologies has reached a level of \nmaturity that can now be integrated with user means, both professional and private. \nFor example, there are weather forecasting applications which are used by government \n\n \n\n\n\n79Space Program Management\n\nusers, public services or administrations for local, national or international forecasts; \nDTH \u201cDirect-To-Home\u201d television broadcast services which are used by millions of \nprivate users in Europe and in the world through pay subscriptions with service \nproviders. \n\n The requirements these applications ful fi ll are generally well regarded by users \nwho sometimes, in the case of government users, can be the basis for the origin of the \nspace program acting as decision makers and main or sole investors. \n\n In the case of satellite television broadcast in Europe, for example, the start-up of \nsatellite programs related to two service providers, Eutelsat and SES-Astra, illustrate \nthis situation well. \n\n Eutelsat was established in the 1980s as a European government organization, as \nthe major national telecommunication companies, which were publicly held at the \ntime, subscribed to them. It bene fi tted for its start-up of the service of the technologi-\ncal developments realized by ESA, through the satellites manufactured by European \nindustry for ESA and a broadcast monopoly on various European territories. This was \nobviously due to the needs for the Member States who invested in ESA to ensure a \nreturn on investment. Then with time, the organization developed into a private busi-\nness with private and nongovernmental shareholders and today it has been solidly \nestablished on the commercial market. \n\n SES-Astra, on the other hand, clearly began as a commercial venture and therefore \nbased itself on private initiative, which in the 1990s decided it was a potential advan-\ntage to invest in the DTH application in Europe. \n\n European weather forecasting also followed a similar approach to the one fol-\nlowed in telecommunications and created Eumetsat, a European government \norganization which includes national weather forecasting services as shareholders \nand began to use speci fi c satellites built by ESA. \n\n However, in the case of ESA\u2019s operational application missions, the decision-\nmaking mechanisms are not the usual ones of business initiatives, where return on \ninvestment is the priority for starting up a program, but tend to introduce technological \ninnovations that can bring about developments which lead space systems towards the \nhighest possible TRL and ILR levels and therefore can attract the future interest of \nbusiness  fi rms. \n\n Figure  2.8  illustrates a type of decision-making model for a mission of this type \nand refers to a generic Earth observation mission adopted by ESA within the frame-\nwork of the Global Monitoring Environment & Security-GMES program.  \n\n      Pre-Operational Missions \n A pre-operational mission has different features since the evaluation of innovation \ncomponent and the experimental component are signi fi cantly high, but at such a level \nas to allow the start-up of operations to validate subsequent operational missions. \n\n The general model for a mission of this type is illustrated in Figure  2.9  for a \ngeneric example of pre-operation experimentation in orbit of an Earth observation \nsatellite. \n\n It is important to observe the emphasis which should be put on thematic analyses, \nthe studies that de fi ne the mission and for this reason the type of onboard instruments \nto be developed to respond to the mission requirements. \n\n\n\n80\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nMISSION OBJECTIVES:\n\nORBITS, PAYLOAD\n\nSTATUS\nPAYLOAD, \nPLATFORM\n\nUSERS\n\nANALYSIS \n\nDATA FROM \nDIFFERENT \nSENSORS\n\nR & D COOPE-\nRATION\n\nGROUND \nSEGMENT\n\nSIMULATION DATA\n\nMISSION\n& PAYLOAD DEFINITION\n\nEVALUATION\n\nMARKET, \nPRICING\u2026.\n\nDATA FLOW \nCAPACITY\n\nTECHNICAL \nFEASIBILITY (R & D)\n\nGROUND \nSEGMENT\n\nFINAL SELECTION\n&\n\nDECISION\n\nPROCESS\n\nINFORMATION\n\nPROTECTION\nLO\n\nO\nP\n\n O\nF\n\n A\nN\n\nA\nLY\n\nS\nIS\n\n  Figure 2.8.

A consultation has already been done which identi fi ed with some instru-\nments suitable for ful fi lling mission requirements. \n\n \n\n\n\n82 Space Program Management\n\n As stated previously, in starting up this type of mission, it is not certain that the \nTLR levels of certain sensors or instruments are adequate, but it is for these reasons \nthat the agency implements a program with those instruments to create technological \nand industrial innovation.   \n\n      Commercial Programs \n\n In the two preceding paragraphs the logics of development of the two types of ESA \nprograms has been discussed. In 1975 ESA was the European agency to have created \nthe foundation for the scienti fi c and industrial programming of space projects. The \nprocess which brought ESA to adopt the logics of start-up and management of pro-\ngrams was highly in fl uenced by its interactions with NASA. European experts, dur-\ning the 1970s and 1980s, worked with their US counterparts to understand the \nproblems concerning the development of space programs and to draw up procedures \nwhich were then \u201cassimilated\u201d to the US procedures already in place in those years. \n\n The 1960s had brought well-known space successes to the USA. In the 1980s and \n1990s following increasing commercial development, mainly in telecommunications, \nof satellite systems, the implementation of a commercial program developed deci-\nsion-making processes which differ substantially from ESA or NASA\u2019s government \nagency logic. \n\n Typically a commercial program has two basic features:\n\n   The need for low-risk technology and low operational dif fi culty (developmentally \u2022 \nand for use in orbit)  \n  The need for the highest economic ef fi ciency of its system    \u2022 \n\n These guiding parameters are the bases for technological and program choices. \nThis is why a commercial system always involves the development of an already \nproven system with operational experience, high reliability and long operational life, \nwith low development time and rapid injection into orbit. \n\n As a result, the components are already quali fi ed and tested in orbit and the \n development of the system does not vary from industrial processes already in \nplace. \n\n It is very rare for a business which intends to use space systems, for example, \noperators of telecommunication satellites or satellite images, to introduce technologi-\ncal innovations in their systems which would bear risks in the development and \nlaunch of the system. \n\n Moreover, very often a commercial operator of satellite systems does not have the \nstaff with speci fi c space technology competences and uses outside consultants \n(experts in the space sector) who work to de fi ne the system and the subsequent con-\ntrol of the program. \n\n The development of a commercial program therefore differs from the ones exam-\nined previously and generally consists of  fi ve phases, highlighted in Figure  2.10 . \n\n In phase 1 the company performs market studies, de fi nes the business model to be \nimplemented, evaluates the technological and economic risk, and essentially draws \nup its business plan. \n\n\n\n83\n\n1 2 3 4 5 \u2026 15\n\nFeasibility Study \n\nRequest For Information RFI\n\nRequest or Proposal RFP\n\nOffer selection and negotiation\n\nProduction\n\nLaunch\n\nOperations\n\nDe-orbiting\n\nYEARS\n\n  Figure 2.10.    General decision-making process timing of a commercial program.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n In phase 2 the company sends industrial producers it has selected an RFI, Request \nfor Information, similar to the Call for Ideas mentioned previously concerning the \nstart-up processes of ESA programs. \n\n The RFI contains preliminary but fairly speci fi c requests such as:\n\n   Production experience  \u2022 \n  Possible technical proposals to improve the effectiveness of the proposed produc-\u2022 \ntion cycle  \n  Preliminary estimate of costs and timetable    \u2022 \n\n In phase 3 the company sends selected industries, which have responded to the \nRFI, an RFP, a Request For Proposal. At this point the industry which wishes to win \nthe contract to develop the program gives a detailed proposal of the program whose \nstructure will be discussed in Chap.   3     and which does not substantially differ from the \none put into place by the industry toward an agency such as ESA or NASA. \n\n In phase 4 the company has selected the supplier, has signed the contract and the \nproduction process for the \u201cprocurement\u201d of the system begins. The management of \nthe program is the core of phase 4 and ends with the system going into orbit. \n\n In phase 5 the supplier transfers the system in orbit to the customer (the company or \nagency which authorized the project) and commercial operations begin which last an \nundetermined number of years generally ending with a deactivation phase, in the case of \ngeostationary telecommunication satellites this phase implies a de-orbitation of the space-\ncraft. The satellite is essentially moved, with a small amount of residual fuel, onto a \nslightly different orbit from the one used for operations so it does not \u201ccrowd\u201d space.   \n\n    2.5.   Development Phases of a Space Program \n\n Space programs in the world as in Europe were soon organized into  Phases , corre-\nsponding to the development of the life of the program itself. \n\n Once the feasibility studies have been done, the decision to start up a program \nor not is taken, and then the drawing up of the Management Plan is completed. \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3755-0_3\n\n\n84 Space Program Management\n\nThe program is  fi nally realized, it is physically launched into space and the \nservices/ applications for which the mission was de fi ned are used. \n\n However, given the increasing complexity of space programs the minimum time \nbetween the  fi rst feasibility studies and launch into space can vary between 28 and 36 \nmonths needed for realizing, for example, a commercial telecommunication satellite, \nor from 6 or even 10 years needed to realize and qualify a launcher. In several cases, \nwe have gone over 15 years, such as for the realization of the ISS. \n\n This long-term time frame leads program managers to detail the timetable of the \nManagement Plan into  Phases  which are  fi nally de fi ned as the development objec-\ntives to be followed. The organization of the various activities, objectives and inter-\nmediate results into a time framework is indispensable today. \n\n Every passage from one phase to another is authorized by program managers and \ncontractually con fi rms the technical consistency of the work performed up to that \npoint by the industrial group. In so doing the question of technical choices of the \npreceding Phase is avoided, unless there are major problems in development. \n\n      Logic of Program Control \n\n Because of their size and technological speci fi cations, space programs take many years to \nachieve with an investment budget of hundreds (and even thousands) millions of euro. \n\n Building in 30 months a large commercial telecommunications satellite with over \n50 transponders on board can cost over 300 million euro, including the manufacturing \nof the satellite, the purchase of the launcher, the insurance and the construction of the \nground segment. \n\n For example, the construction and launch of the  fi rst four Italian satellites of Earth \nobservation, Cosmo Skymed, cost over 1.2 billion euro in 5 years. \n\n Therefore, it is impossible to wait for the end of a program to verify whether it is \nsatisfactory to the users. \n\n It is necessary to control the program activities to validate technical and economi-\ncal solutions adopted as the activities develop during the course of the program. \n\n The biggest problem for controlling these activities involves:\n\n   Decisions which in fl uence investment too early in the program (see Figure  \u2022 2.11 )  \n  Nondeviance from initial requirements    \u2022 \n\n The logic of control can be de fi ned correct if:\n\n   Ensured convergence toward the speci fi ed development objective step by step, \u2022 \nwith cost and time conditions are duly respected.  \n  Management of a progressive and controlled commitment of the means and \u2022 \nresources for developing the program, with choices that should not hinder techni-\ncal solutions prematurely.  \n  Consolidated results through the program are achieved to reach the progressive \u2022 \ndevelopment of the system step by step.  \n  We provide for a time and  fi nancial \u201creserve\u201d from the beginning called \u201ccontin-\u2022 \ngency\u201d or \u201cmargin,\u201d as illustrated in Figure  2.12 .    \n\n\n\n85\n\nProgram Timeframe\n\nProgram Cost\n\n80 %\n\n100 %\n\n1 10\n\nInvestments\n\nDecisional Cost\n\nRealizationDesign Studies\n\n  Figure 2.11.

Each Phase is \ncharacterized by a milestone. \n\n Every milestone allows us to:\n\n   Verify what has been developed  \u2022 \n  Verify what in fl uences negatively the progress of the program    \u2022 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n86 Space Program Management\n\n Milestones are the opportunity for analyzing:\n\n    1.

A decision by the program manager on the progress of the activity including the \napplication of issued recommendations     \n\n Since the 1960s the USA has felt the need to standardize project logics and this \nprocess was established with the drawing up of a series of requirements called the \nNASA Military Standard. Through these standards the customer and contractor pos-\nsessed the speci fi c program procedures to be followed. \n\n Beginning in the 1970s, after the inception of ESA in 1975, a similar need was felt in \nEurope. The ECSS, European Cooperation for Space Standardization, standard was \ndeveloped and internationally recognized and assimilated to the US Military Standards. \n\n The ECSS are subdivided into three levels:\n\n    1.    Series E, engineering  \n    2.    Series Q, product quality  \n    3.    Series M, management     \n\n And have three different levels of detail. In the  fi rst there are the standards for \ndetermining strategies and requirements, in the second management functions and \nobjectives and in the third level the guidelines for reaching level 2 are outlined. \n\n Figure  2.13  shows an overview of ESA\u2019s ECSS. \n Let\u2019s go on to de fi ne the various program Phases. Each Phase ends with a \u201creview,\u201d \n\na large meeting in which a committee (\u201cboard\u201d), with speci fi c program managers and \nexperts, analyzes the results achieved and on this basis de fi nes action for control and \nrecovery, and deciding whether to proceed or not to the next Phase. \n\n      Phase 0, or Mission/Project Concept \n After a Call for Ideas generally various projects for missions are examined and the \nmanaging authorities of the program select only few of them for a more in-depth \nanalysis, the Phase 0. \n\n The objective of a Phase 0 is to gather the elements which allow to judge formally \nthe size of a program, level of industrial, technical and  fi nancial requirements deemed \nnecessary for the mission\u2019s requirements. \n\n Consequently, in Phase 0:\n\n   The mission must be de fi ned and its objectives clari fi ed.  \u2022 \n  One or more systems that can achieve the mission must be identi fi ed as well as the \u2022 \nmajor problems to be resolved.  \n  An estimate of the means, timetable, and resources necessary must be drawn up.    \u2022 \n\n\n\n87\n\nProgram Management \n\nTerminology\n\nProduct Quality Engineering\n\nECSS-P-OO\nStandards\n\nECSS-P-OO\nStandards\n\nECSS-P-001ECSS-P-001\n\nECSS-E-00ECSS-E-00\n\nECSS-E-10ECSS-E-10\nTecnhical System\n\nECSS-Q-00ECSS-Q-00\nPolitics & objectives\n\nECSS-Q-20ECSS-Q-20\nQuality Control\n\nECSS-Q-30ECSS-Q-30\nDependability\n\nPolitics & objectives\n\nProgram Adaptation\n\nProgram organization\n\nPhases & Planning\n\nConfiguration management\n\nDocumentation management\n\nCosts & Time management\n\nECSS-M-70ECSS-M-70\n\nECSS-M-60ECSS-M-60\n\nECSS-M-50ECSS-M-50\n\nECSS-M-40ECSS-M-40\n\nECSS-M-30ECSS-M-30\n\nECSS-M-20ECSS-M-20\n\nECSS-M-10ECSS-M-10\n\nECSS-M-00ECSS-M-00\n\nIntegrated Logistic Support\n\nECSS-Q-40ECSS-Q-40\nSecurity\n\nECSS-Q-60ECSS-Q-60\nEEE parts\n\nECSS-Q-70ECSS-Q-70\nMaterials & components.\n\nECSS-Q-80ECSS-Q-80\nSoftware quality control\n\nECSS-E-20ECSS-E-20\nElectrical & Electronic System\n\nECSS-E-30ECSS-E-30\nMechanical Systems\n\nECSS-E-40ECSS-E-40\nSoftwareSoftware\n\nECSS-E-70ECSS-E-70\nGround segment & Ops.\n\nPolitics & objectives\n\nECSS\nEuropean Cooperation\n\nfor Space Standardization\n\n  Figure 2.13.    Overview of ECSS, European Cooperation for Space Standardization.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n Phase 0 is executed with a preliminary project which must allow decision-making \nauthorities or the customer to follow or not follow through with the analysis of the \nmission under consideration. \n\n A positive decision at this point is a key moment for the program, it is a decisive \nstep and really begins the program. \n\n The  fi nal review of the Phase 0 is called MDR, \u201cMission De fi nition Review.\u201d  \n\n      Phase A, or Feasibility Study \n Usually, following Phase 0 if the proposal has drawn enough interest for its develop-\nment, Phase A is begun for a more in-depth analysis. \n\n Therefore, the objective of Phase A is to evaluate the program\u2019s feasibility under \ntechnical aspects, cost and time, leading to a more concrete identi fi cation of risks \nassociated with the development of this program. \n\n Therefore, during Phase A:\n\n   The objectives of the proposed program are clearly stated and the mission require-\u2022 \nments duly identi fi ed.  \n  The  fi nancial and strategic analyses are also detailed.  \u2022 \n  Technical modalities for realization and implementation are analyzed to synthesize \u2022 \nthe main technical dif fi culties to be overcome and to estimate the possibility of \nconcretely achieve the objectives of the program.    \n\n At the end of Phase A a technical- fi nancial report must be drawn up as well as an \nanalysis relative to the program\u2019s implementation which must contain:\n\n   A development plan proposal, \u201cDevelopment Plan,\u201d with the technological R&D \u2022 \nplan that will be necessary for developing the program (for example, for the \nEuropean program Galileo for satellite navigation, the Development Plan also \n\n \n\n\n\n88\n\nFUNCTIONAL SYSTEM\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nJUSTIFICATION FILE\n\nTECHNICAL SYSTEM \nSPECIFICATIONS\n\nMISSION DEFINITION \nDOCUMENT\n\nSYSTEM DEFINITION\nDOCUMENT \n\nManagement \nPlan\n\nManagement \nPlan\n\n\u2022 Organization\n\u2022 Planning\n\u2022 Risk management\n\u2022 Costs\n\u2022 \u2026\u2026\u2026\n\n  Figure 2.14.

For example, in the development of a commercial \nsatellite, an incorrect estimate of delivery time causes the customer, i.e., a com-\nmercial operator, a loss of return for selling lately the service, and for the industrial \ngroup a payment penalty by the customer.  \n  A realistic project of the  fi nancial model of the program, its management organiza-\u2022 \ntion and related documentation.    \n\n Figure  2.14  illustrates the  fl ow of relative documents of various activities which \nwill then be the basis of the  fi nal \u201cmilestone\u201d of the Phase, the  fi nal review. This  fl ow \nis extremely important for following the program because basic requirements for \nstarting up the program develop from it. \n\n Usually in space programs, at the time Phase A is completed, an initial large meet-\ning is held to review the analyses performed, the PRR \u201cPreliminary Requirements \nReview.\u201d \n\n The decision-making authorities, for example, the customer, whether ESA or \nanother purchasing agency or commercial operator which is ordering a product, par-\nticipate in this meeting. Then there is obviously the participation of the industrial \ngroup which has done the analysis and there might also be present agencies and \n external resources to the program with a declared expertise that are called upon by \nthe decision-making authority to help evaluate the report. \n\n The results of the review lead to the selection or nonselection of the program, \nconsidering the recommendations for modi fi cations and/or variations issued by the \nmembers of the review board during their analyses. \n\n \n\n\n\n89Space Program Management\n\n Efforts in terms of resources to be used in Phase A obviously depend on the \nbreadth of the program to be implemented. For example, the Phase 0 study of a new \nlauncher can last several months and up to over a year, using dozens of resources, i.e., \nmonths of manpower.  \n\n      Phase B, or Preliminary De fi nition \n The objective of this Phase is to reach a complete de fi nition of the program. The \nstart-up of Phase B is already an important choice by decision-making authorities \nsince it validates the technical- fi nancial choices made in Phase A and therefore adopts \nthe technical options which form the basis of the program. \n\n The start-up of this Phase generally indicates the taking into charge of the program \nby its developers and because of its importance a signi fi cant amount of work is per-\nformed, especially:\n\n   The analysis and de fi nitive choice of the system/product to develop in the pro-\u2022 \ngram. For this reason there is an evaluation and discussion of concrete technical \nchoices. Once they are completed they will make up the speci fi cations of the sys-\ntem to be developed.  \n  The de fi nition of the system architecture and of the functional distribution of the \u2022 \nvarious subsystems.  \n  The de fi nition of the future program with regard to Research and Development.  \u2022 \n  The writing of the complete Development Plan, of the number of platform to \u2022 \ndevelop, testing and qualifying procedures and means for these purposes (for \nexample, the detailed de fi nition of mechanical and electrical instruments for \ntesting).  \n  The de fi nition of the managerial and industrial organization charged with imple-\u2022 \nmenting the program, including a detailed evaluation of the means, human and \nmaterial, which are needed.    \n\n The end of Phase B is also subject to a program review, generally referred to as \nPDR, \u201cPreliminary Design Review.\u201d \n\n Frequently, due to the size of the program the  fi nancial investment can be heavy \nalso to complete Phases A and B, therefore this phase is subdivided into two or more \nsub-Phases, called B1, B2\u2026.Bn. Each of these phases ends with an intermediate \nreview, referred to as SRR, \u201cSystem Requirements Review,\u201d whose implementation \nand conclusion are necessary for the start-up of the subsequent sub-Phase. \n\n Generally speaking, B1 is aimed at de fi ning the system\u2019s speci fi cations and B2 to \nsubsystem speci fi cations. However, each program may be subdivided into sub-Phases \naccording to different criteria. This method helps a leveraged up-front investment. \n\n In Phase B the program usually mobilizes already enormous amounts of resources \nand of capital, and the effort made in terms of months/manpower can turn into a \ncomplex satellite project (for example, ESA\u2019s scienti fi c satellites) with dozens more \nmonths/manpower. Even the cost of Phase B reaches 10\u201315% of the total cost \n estimate of the program. Therefore, the conceptual choices of this Phase determine \n80 or 90% of the program\u2019s implementation cost. \n\n Thus, the importance of the decision to continue the program at the end of the PDR \nof Phase B is evident, since the subsequent Phases will concern the actual implemen-\ntation of the program.  \n\n\n\n90 Space Program Management\n\n      Phase C, or Detailed De fi nition \n The objective of this Phase is to achieve the implementation speci fi cations. \n\n In this Phase the industrial group is called upon to detail the constitutive parts of \nthe program and the conditions for their realization. Therefore, it is a major industrial \noperation which involves not only detailed studies, but also models and preliminary \ntesting. \n\n The CDR, \u201cCritical Design Review\u201d comes at the end of Phase C and precedes the \nrealization phase.  \n\n      Phase D, or Production \n During the course of this Phase of the program, the system is built and tested, and its \nability to ful fi ll the mission\u2019s requirements for which it was implemented is \nveri fi ed. \n\n Obviously this veri fi cation occurs under operational conditions and on a structure \nwhich will be used on the mission. \n\n A speci fi c review of operational quali fi cation ends this Phase. Usually, given the \ncomplexity and time length of Phase D, various intermediate reviews are necessary \nand their importance is heavily affected by the launch time deadline. \n\n In programs for developing satellites and launchers, for example, Phase D is bro-\nken up into steps with speci fi c reviews, for example, the QR, \u201cQuali fi cation Review,\u201d \nthe PCR, \u201cProduction Con fi guration Review\u201d up to the AR, the \u201cAcceptance \nReview,\u201d which take stock of the situation and which are mandatory passages (mile-\nstones) which must be passed for the progress of activities which in fact end with the \nlaunch of the system into space. \n\n The decision taken by decision-making authorities to go to the next Phase,  following \na positive \u201cAcceptance Review,\u201d concludes the end of the program\u2019s development. \n\n Sometimes Phases C and D are \u201cuni fi ed\u201d under the term Phase C/D.  \n\n      Phase E, or Operations \n The space system developed by the program is launched into space during this Phase \nand operates by supplying services for which it was designed. \n\n The ORR, \u201cOperational Readiness Review\u201d provides evidence of the system\u2019s \nfunction and authorizes the start-up of the launch campaign which ends with the FRR, \n\u201cFlight Readiness Review\u201d which gives the de fi nitive and  fi nal approval for launch \ninto orbit. \n\n Usually, for a telecommunications satellite, the ORR takes place 2\u20133 months \nbefore the launch and starts up the launch campaign, the sending of the satellite to \nthe launch site for  fi nal test operations, loading of fuel and  fi nal integration with the \nlauncher. The FRR takes place the day before the launch and after its positive \n conclusion the launcher is loaded with fuel and sent to the launch sequence. \n\n Once in orbit, a scienti fi c satellite\u2019s instruments begin to operate and transmit the data \nfor several years, a telecommunications satellite begins to receive and transmit radiofre-\nquency signals on the geographical area it covers for over 10 years. A launcher instead \nputs into orbit and releases a satellite it is carrying on board after less than hour from the \nlaunch time to Earth, and so it ends almost immediately its operational Phase. \n\n It should be noted that in the case of recurrent production systems, mainly referred \nto commercial satellites or launchers of the same version, the functional data gathered \n\n\n\n91\n\n1.1.\n\n2.2.

General model of the program Phases.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\nduring the course of Phase D often lead to signi fi cant modi fi cations of the system \nduring its lifetime. \n\n Here is where the program introduces modi fi cations at every level in its \nDevelopment Plan and this leads to a new process in Phases, obviously noticeably \naccelerated compared to the initial one, which observe the logic foreseen, however \nmodifying elements or subsystems of the original development process. \n\n This analysis can lead to Phase F, or  fi nal placement, with the conclusion of the \noperational life of the system and its deactivation. \n\n A synthesis of the Phase process is summarized in Figure  2.15 . In this planning \nthere is a variable \u201ctime\u201d frame axis inserted, i.e., the measure of the duration of the \nproject as a nominal duration of the program. \n\n The project  fl ow which is de fi ned above does not only apply to the program\u2019s \nPrime Contractor, but in cascade fashion involves all the sub-suppliers for which the \nreview process is managed directly by the Prime Contractor. However, the approval \nfor the advancement and payment is usually delegated to the main customer. This is \nthe common practice for ESA programs. \n\n Obviously, at the level of equipment and subsystems, the project  fl ow must come \nbefore the system and critical reviews must be done before the program Phases, oth-\nerwise the impact on overall planning would become unmanageable. \n\n Figure  2.16  illustrates a functional hierarchy of the project\u2019s responsibility as an \nexample of this. \n\n \n\n\n\n92\n\nPrime ContractorPrime Contractor\n\nLevel n sub-contractor\n\nR\neq\n\nu\nir\n\nem\nen\n\nts\n/s\n\np\nec\n\ns\n\nPHASE C\n\nQUALIFICATION\n\nCDRCDRPDRPDR\n\nQRN\u20131QRN\u20131\n\nCDRNCDRN\n\nLevel n-1 sub-contractor\n\nPHASE C\n\n  Figure 2.16.    Example of the hierarchy of program responsibility.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n There is a difference between the methods used for institutional programs, such as \nESA\u2019s and the practice for commercial programs for which technological innovation, \nwith greater risk, are usually neglected. \n\n However, even in commercial programs the ECSS standardization model is used \nas a model, because the quality control and production  fl ow represents in any case a \nguarantee of product reliability for the customer.   \n\n      Advantages and Limitations of Subdividing the Program into Phases \n\n The organization of a program into progressive steps forward and intermediate \n decision-making steps have an undeniable advantage in terms of:\n\n   Criteria and progressive de fi nition of the activities to be developed and the \u2022 \n necessary means.  \n  Engaging means and necessary resources only at the right moment.  \u2022 \n  Control by responsible authorities of the state of advancement and possibility of \u2022 \nimplementing more effective management techniques.    \n\n On the other hand, limitations are present essentially in the dif fi culty of describing \nin stable and standardized models the complete process of development of a space \nprogram which develops in a government, industrial, and commercial context in con-\nstant evolution. \n\n The creation of Joint Ventures or industrial mergers, intergovernmental or \ncommercial agreements are variables which can in fl uence the life of a space pro-\ngram which lasts many years. \n\n Obviously, the program managers must organize activities with thoroughness and \nlogic to predispose a solid and orderly organization of the Management Plan as much \nas possible. However, they have to include  fl exibility in the organization to adapt to \npotential evolutions of the context. \n\n Quite often, this requires imagination, common sense, and notably human and \norganizational  fl exibility, which can seem contradictory with the notion of engineer-\ning organization for rules and procedures. \n\n \n\n\n\n93Space Program Management\n\n In doing so, managers can therefore be free to design the name and type of the \norganization in Phases within the Management Plan in broad terms. Next to the letters \n0, A, B, C, D, E each manager can, according to the program and the circumstances \nunder which it is developing, add contents to the Phase according to logic and speci fi c \ndevelopment consistency. \n\n For example, it should be noted that in a space program various aspects converge, \nin making an organization complex by distinctly dividing it into Phases. \n\n Technically speaking, it is often necessary to override Phases because of \ndevelopment reasons. A Phase C/D can begin with several subsystems during \nPhase B of the program due to supplies or the beginning of long-term work (real-\nization of building a launch base for example). In another case, several techno-\nlogical developments which should usually end in Phase B can continue on \nduring Phase C/D. \n\n The way different parts of a program advance are almost always different. For \nexample, for a commercial satellite program the de fi nition of Phase B for the ground \nsegment development (reception terminals, for example) must wait for a detailed \ncon fi guration of the space segment (for example, onboard payloads), which cannot \ntake place during Phase C/D. \n\n Finally, the same decision-making process does not always express itself in a syn-\nchronistic manner in time with the program\u2019s development since during the course of \nits development this requires a signi fi cant amount of intermediate operational deci-\nsions which overall will make up those technical choices to be evaluated in terms of \neach Phase in the appropriate review. \n\n It is the task of the Program Manager to harmonize all these activities by coordi-\nnating them in time.  \n\n      The Program Reviews \n\n The program reviews are meetings of limited duration (from 1 day to several weeks) \nheld at pre-established times in the Management Plan and during which the program \nactivities are presented, examined, and criticized. \n\n The program review is a shared tool for controlling and managing the program for \ndecision makers and the Program Managers. \n\n The objective of the program review is to:\n\n   Consider program activities at different time steps.  \u2022 \n  Support decision makers and Program Managers in controlling the state of \u2022 \nadvancement of activities.  \n  Give decision makers and the Program Manager tools for evaluating if the activi-\u2022 \nties allow the continuation of the program or its realignment.    \n\n For this purpose, the method applied to this review is the following:\n\n   Take appropriate distance from usual activities (meeting place, type of behavior) \u2022 \nto examine the elements of the program.  \n  Support different positions without the restriction of discussions and debates.  \u2022 \n  Call upon technical and managerial experts outside the program who can introduce \u2022 \nnew elements into the program, highlighting anomalies or improvements.    \n\n\n\n94 Space Program Management\n\n Every review is usually organized so that a \u201creview group\u201d made up of a certain \nnumber of people not necessarily directly involved in the program evaluate it by \nexamining documents and attending presentations by the Program Managers and \nindustrial group. \n\n The review group, which elects its President, issues \u201cobservations\u201d and \u201crecom-\nmendations\u201d written on standard forms which are sent to decision makers and the \nProgram Managers for appropriate evaluation and actions. \n\n An essential aspect is the organization of the review and it is useful to distinguish \nthat there are two important periods in the life of a program for which reviews \nshould be set up at different levels (system, subsystem, and equipment) in different \nmanner. \n\n The  fi rst period is the de fi nition of the program when activities involve study and \nconcept-making, and the subsequent reviews can \u201cdiverge\u201d to various levels (system, \nsubsystem, equipment), but are conducted chronologically in increasing order. \n\n The corresponding Phases are 0, A, and B. \n The second period is the program development when the activities involve build-\n\ning and testing, and the subsequent reviews \u201cconverge\u201d at all levels towards the \nreviews of the system. \n\n The corresponding Phases are C and D. \n The reviews can have various forms according to the program function and orga-\n\nnization of the review group. However, given the nature of space programs, these \nmeetings always maintain a certain formality of procedure that is appropriate to the \nlimitations of diffusion and con fi dentiality which shared technical information often \nrequires. \n\n In review groups, one must always keep in mind that the objective is not to take \nthe place of the Program Mangers, but to get the best possible evaluation of how the \nprogram is progressing. \n\n Through speci fi c numbered technical notes, issued by the industrial group, the \nreview group takes notes of the problems which have been brought up for subsequent \ndiscussion and possible shelving. Should a problem not be shelved it gives way to an \naction for the authorities to verify and subsequent closure of the problem. \n\n The review group, guided by its President, steers the meeting, establishes the \nagenda, gathers technical notes of the problems to be resolved, organizes analyses for \nnecessary solutions, and synthesizes the activities performed. \n\n His role is essential for presenting to the decision makers observations and  fi nal \nrecommendations during the concluding meeting of the review. \n\n It is not an easy task to gather competent, motivated and available people for a \nreview group. \n\n Decision makers and the Program Managers have to show common sense and \nsharp skills for choosing and assembling the right people, many of whom are not \ndirectly involved in the program, who can truly understand the technical choices \nmade and understand possible development problems. \n\n This is the actual basis of the review: to ask competent questions and perceive \npossible problems. \n\n Therefore, for a successful review one should have a well-prepared review group, \nthe right mix of internal, external and people close to the program and de fi nitely a \nmajor personal attachment to the activity. \n\n\n\n95Space Program Management\n\n The main risks of the Review are almost always due to excessive formalism where \nform is criticized and not the real issues involved. Another risk is super fi cial exami-\nnation of the relevant aspects of the program in a limited time frame. \n\n One of the main tasks of the President of the review group or its steering commit-\ntee, the \u201cboard,\u201d is to minimize these risks.                        \n\n\n\n97\n\n            3.1.   Notion of Marketing \n\n    In terms of economics, marketing is required when supply is greater than demand. \nThis occurs when products, or projects, offered by industries and companies are \ngreater than the number of customers who can buy the products, or  fi nance the \nprojects. \n\n In this sense, demand can be understood as an interest to purchase for commercial \npurposes (for example, a telecommunications satellite operator who intends to buy a \nsatellite to increase its pro fi ts) or the ability to spend for various reasons (for example, \nthe European Space Agency intends to award a large contract for making a scienti fi c \nsatellite to increase our knowledge of the universe). \n\n Economists generally classify economic situations into four types:\n\n   Production economy, when industries do not produce enough what customers \u2022 \nrequire. In this case, there is no need for marketing.  \n  Distribution economy, when there is a balance between supply and demand, this \u2022 \nis obviously an ideal situation and even in this case there is no need for \nmarketing.  \n  Market economy, when the industrial supply is greater, sometimes much greater, \u2022 \nthan the demand. In this case the marketing is an essential tool.  \n  Context economy, when noneconomic but equally in fl uential players (for example, \u2022 \ngovernments, institutions and agencies) become involved, very often indirectly. \nThis type of economy very much resembles a market economy in which marketing \nbecomes even more important given the context in which it operates.    \n\n Space programs fall into the category of the last two types of economies because \nmarketing plays a signi fi cant role in the sector which must adapt to the previously \nde fi ned special features of space activities. \n\n However, marketing, especially within an industry, must be in step with the \nmarket. \n\n In other terms, management must have a commonly directed understanding of the \nmarket. \n\n    Chapter 3   \n\n Marketing of Space Programs       \n\nM. Spagnulo et al., Space Program Management: Methods and Tools, \nSpace Technology Library 28, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3755-0_3, \n\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n\n\n98 Space Program Management\n\n This is not always the case in space programs because high-tech industries are \noften driven by engineering. Their primary objective is to improve technology, direct-\ning the program more towards innovation rather than the customer\u2019s real \nexpectations. \n\n Markets with strong government backing such as space programs very often pres-\nent this feature. \n\n The drive towards technological enhancement can therefore be counterproductive, \nbut there is also a paradox in which the space industry tends towards a production \neconomy, just like all industries, where it increases its own budget margins, business \nvolume, and then pro fi ts. In so doing, the industry aims at technological innovation \nwhich once perceived and accepted by the market, drives the industry towards a pro-\nduction economy. \n\n This is why the industrial mix for a space market  fl uctuates between innovation \nand its own limitation signi fi cantly. When the budget can ensure a good economic \ncontext,  fl uctuations are more easily absorbed by the industrial sector.  \n\n    3.2.   Function of Marketing in a Space Program \n\n There is no single de fi nition of marketing for space programs. We can de fi ne market-\ning by considering two different viewpoints. The  fi rst de fi nition is based on the view-\npoint of someone with no special technical training and the second by professionals \nin the sector. This is why we would probably  fi nd two facets which appear different \nat  fi rst glance. \n\n For the layman, marketing probably consists mainly in advertising and other forms \nof promotion. This is due to the in fl uence of businesses on people to buy or consume \nproducts and would therefore be an instrument for exerting in fl uence. \n\n For the marketing professional, however, marketing is the process for knowing \nand foreseeing what the customer has in mind and to understand how the company \ncan ful fi ll the customer\u2019s needs in an economically effective way in this situation. \nMarketing is therefore an analytical tool. \n\n For space sector industries, which usually are located midway between a market \nand context economy, marketing corresponds to the sum total of both viewpoints. \nDepending on which of the two economies prevail, in fl uence marketing can be more \nor less a priority compared to analytical marketing. \n\n For example, for a space program in a context economy system such as the \nEuropean navigation system Galileo, in fl uence marketing is certainly a priority and \nessential, and forces marketing analysis into second place because of the political, \nstrategical, and economic context of the program itself. \n\n On the other hand, a commercial program for selling a telecommunications satel-\nlite to an operator, analytical marketing is a priority. \n\n At the start of space activities, the context economy predominated. Since 1970s \nboth economies, context and market, have developed signi fi cantly. However, since \nthe 1980s marketing has gained more importance in production and has become at \ntimes a central function, certainly not more important than production, but it has an \nimportant role as \u201cthe customer\u2019s ambassador\u201d for production, administrative, or \n fi nancial functions. For example, the commercial function of the European company \n\n\n\n99Marketing of Space Programs\n\nArianespace which has been selling launch services into space since 1980s for the \nAriane launcher is a central and highly in fl uential element in the industry\u2019s \norganization. \n\n In examining the special nature of the function, we must also consider the fact that \nmarketing does not correspond to the same functions in all industries or all \ncountries. \n\n In Europe the Marketing Director of a space industry generally involves all the \nanalysis and in fl uence functions, but not sales, while in the USA the Marketing \nDirector includes in fl uence and sales functions, while analysis is performed by a \ntechnical unit. \n\n However, there is no basic rule even in these cases. The previously mentioned \nArianespace was the  fi rst in Europe to develop an organizational model where a \nCommercial Directorate includes marketing analysis, in fl uence, and sales. \n\n Therefore, there are no preestablished solutions (Figure  3.1 ). \n If there are separate functions, internal rivalry would probably result which could \n\nharm the industry since it would create obstacles. However, they can be bene fi cial to \ncritical analysis and intellectual variety which astute management can pro fi t from. \n\n In conclusion, the American approach reduces the risk of con fl ict, but with the \npotential invasive development of marketing\u2019s power in a company life.  \n\n    3.3.   Marketing of Programs and Services \n\n The space sector has been characterized at the beginning by a signi fi cant amount of \ninnovation and the rather signi fi cant importance of technology. \n\n When a space program involves more effective, innovative and ingenious tech-\nnologies, the industry gains a competitive edge. \n\n Marketing mix is therefore the result of the mix of economies\u2014market and con-\ntext, in which the program is set forth. \n\n The marketing mix of space programs cannot be generally classi fi ed as consumer \nmarket, i.e., \u201cbusiness to consumer,\u201d but as a \u201cbusiness to business.\u201d It is the sale \nfrom business to business or organization enacted through a speci fi c marketing \nprogram. \n\n The marketing of space programs characterizes businesses which propose unique \ncomplex projects even when they are repetitive; for example, the production of \nlaunchers in series. \n\n The marketing of space programs therefore requires adapting one\u2019s own develop-\nment philosophy because realizing a space mission requires sophisticated savoir-faire \nand an enormous economic and  fi nancial investment. \n\n For example, the procedures for tenders or Call for Ideas of space agencies have \nbeen de fi ned for years and are constantly applied with standard methods that also \nin fl uence the procedures for commercial tenders. \n\n In each case then marketing strategy basically involves creating a close network \nof relations before the tender, or request of offer to be able to in fl uence the customer \nin some way concerning the de fi nition of the program requirements. \n\n The marketing of space programs, which is much more sophisticated compared \nto classic industrial marketing or with consumer goods marketing, still offers the \n\n\n\n100\n\nGeneral Manager\n\nCommercial DirectoratePrograms Directorate Financial Directorate\n\nLegal Directorate\n\nExternal\nRelations\n\nCommercial\nStudies\n\nMarketing Contracts\n&\n\nSales\n\nPlanning\n\nProposal\nManager\n\nMarketing\nManager\n\nPlanning\nManager\n\nContract\nManager\n\nProgram\nManager\n\nProgram Team\nProposal Team\n\nTechnical\nManager\n\nTechnical Directorate\n\nProduction Facilities\n\n  Figure 3.1.    An example of industrial and marketing organization.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\npotential for development despite certain procedures which have been established, \nas previously stated. \n\n For example, in the mid-2000s the marketing of Skynet V for the development and \nputting into orbit of satellites for military telecommunications for the British Defense \nMinistry, was an innovative model for space programs since it was the  fi rst time a \ntype of Project Financing for military-type services was used. \n\n The marketing of space programs features \u201cbusiness-to-business\u201d transactions \nbetween suppliers of devices and equipment, subsystems manufacturers, system inte-\ngrators, and lastly customers. \n\n The chart in Figure  3.2  illustrates the business chain. \n In essence, only the  fi nal transaction can involve the consumer market, the market-\n\ning of services; for example, telecommunications via satellite of the DTH business \n\u201cDirect-To-Home\u201d television generated by the  fi nal applications aimed at consumer \nsales through subscriptions to television channel packages. \n\n Satellite navigation business is of particular relevance. \n In this case the consumer market has been developed through the development of \n\napplication systems (navigators for cars or mobile phones, for example) which use \nthe radio-electric signal of GPS satellites without charge even though these satellites \nwere not developed for commercial purposes and which are either the property or \nunder the control of operators who sell broad-based consumer applications related to \nthem. \n\n In other words, in buying a satellite navigator for cars there is no commercial \nguarantee on whether it will continue to work because the owner of the GPS system, \nwhose signals are used and which are therefore part of the commercial transaction \n\n \n\n\n\n101\n\nInsurers\n\nGround Terminals\n\nHardware\n\nFinal users\n\nCompanies Telecommunications Operators Radio&TV Operator New Services\n\nElectronic\ncomponents\n\nLauncher sub-\nsystems\n\nMotors\n\nSatellites integrators Launch service\n\nAgencies,\nSatellite Operators\n\nEquipments &\nproducts\n\nManufactured\nproducts\n\nEquipments\n\nMarketing Business to Business (B2B) & Marketing for end-users\n\nProject Marketing\n& Business to\nBusiness Marketing\n(B2B)\n\n  Figure 3.2.     Business network for space sector marketing chart (example of commercial \nor government telecommunications system).       \n\nMarketing of Space Programs\n\nbetween the buyer and the seller of the navigator, is the US Defense Department \nwhich can alter or interrupt the signal according to its own national security \nrequirements. \n\n On the other hand, in the case of a commercial subscription to Pay-TV in which a \n fi nal user who buys the subscription, the service provider supplies the reception \ndevice and the operator, who is almost always the owner of satellites, there is a \n fi nancial transaction which regulates the modalities and service commitments.  \n\n    3.4.   Offer in the Marketing of a Space Program \n\n The steps involved in offer and subsequent contract negotiations make up the two \n fi nal and essential elements of program management which also includes sales. \n\n Here is where the word marketing in space programs can be identi fi ed with the \nprocess of offer, negotiation, and signing of the development contract. \n\n In commercial type programs, the proposer, the system supplier, responds to a \nrequest of offer sent by the customer who intends to buy a determined product under \nthe best market conditions. In this case marketing is essential for the proposer to be \non the list of those to whom the offer is sent. \n\n \n\n\n\n102 Space Program Management\n\n In institutional or government-type programs where the customer is a space \nagency, the tender is published through speci fi c instruments (notices, Web sites) and \nthe proposer must have been previously authorized to accept these information instru-\nments with proper registration and accreditation. \n\n In both cases the customer prepares a document called a SoW, \u201cStatement of \nWork\u201d in which the speci fi cations and the type of work requested are provided in as \nmuch detail as possible. \n\n The SoW is the foundation document which allows:\n\n   The customer to request precisely to the selected suppliers, or in any case, the vari-\u2022 \nous proposers, precise and detailed response to go on to proceed to the  fi nal \ndecision.  \n  The proposers to de fi ne their technical and  fi nancial offer in the best way \u2022 \npossible.    \n\n Generally in the development program of a commercial telecommunication \n satellite, the SoW is generally made up of documents such as:\n\n   Volume 1: presentation of the mission, system and conditions of the tender.  \n  Volume 2: elements which make up the supply.  \n  Volume 3: technical speci fi cations.  \n  Volume 4: management, quality, develop and testing speci fi cations.  \n  Volume 5: the guide for the offer and evaluation parameters.    \n\n Therefore, the proposer must provide the requirements de fi ned in the SoW in his \noffer, paying careful attention to the overall compatibility of the offer with those of \nthe evaluation parameters indicated in the SoW. \n\n Therefore, the de fi nition of a compatibility matrix must be de fi ned in the offer \nwhich will provide the customer with a schematic visualization that the offer adheres \nto his requirements. \n\n This compatibility matrix is essential for all tenders whether they are commercial \nor government since an offer of a system which exceeds the performances de fi ned in \nthe SoW can be rejected because of excessive costs or technical ef fi ciency or uncer-\ntainties regarding technical risk. \n\n The offer must also be made up of various elements such as:\n\n   The letter of offer which is essentially a business letter in which the managers of \u2022 \nthe proposing business express the technical and  fi nancial details of the offer in \nsynthesis.  \n  Volume 1: an \u201cExecutive Summary,\u201d made up of a brief dossier with relatively few \u2022 \npages containing all the features of the offer.  \n  Volume 2: the technical offer, i.e., the descriptive details of the development \u2022 \n proposed and the processing for testing and quali fi cation.  \n  Volume 3: the management and administrative offer which indicates the management \u2022 \ncon fi guration, i.e., how the proposer will organize the program in terms of resources, \nchoice of subsuppliers, program review, and decision-making milestones.  \n  Volume 4: the  fi nancial offer, containing the proposed price, its details, the \u2022 \n eventual revision and payment plan.    \n\n\n\n103Marketing of Space Programs\n\n Volumes 2 and 3 make up the \u201cManagement Plan\u201d de fi ned in Chap.   2    . \n At this point we should focus on the four fundamental aspects of an offer on which \n\nthe entire management of the project will be focused on: the development plan, the \ncharting of single activities, timetable planning, and price (including costs). \n\n The development plan is expressed through the drawing up of an organizational \nstructure called the WBS, \u201cWork Breakdown Structure\u201d which \u201cunwraps\u201d each activ-\nity to be developed, called the WPs, \u201cWork Packages\u201d and identi fi es each of them \naccording to a reference index. Each  fi rst-level WP will be broken down in turn to a \nseries of secondary-level WPs and will go down to the basic level. \n\n As an example, let\u2019s observe Figure  3.3  in which the WBS shown is the develop-\nment plan, subdivided into basic activities, of a telecommunications satellite. As we \ncan see, not only technical but also even administrative type activities such as con-\ntract management or suppliers must be reported and then quanti fi ed in terms of time \nand performance in the relative WP descriptions. \n\n The WBS in Figure  3.3  has been purposely simpli fi ed in the number and detail of \nthe WPs, but it is evident that the Program Manager will have to \u201cbuild\u201d his own devel-\nopment plan from the offer phase with a WBS which matches as much as possible all \nthe basic activities which can be imagined which will make up the total program. \n\n In fact, the WBSs of space systems are extremely complex \u201cstructural maps\u201d \nwhich are however a crucial element for the Program Manager in support of develop-\nment. This is why they are established during the offer phase and then become a \nmandatory reference during development phase. \n\n In Figure  3.4  the basic WBS for a development plan for a space launcher is also \nprovided as an example. In this case the \u201cadministrative\u201d type activities have not been \nreported, and only operative activities are considered for didactic purpose. \n\n In analyzing the charts relative to Work Packages, we see that they generally fol-\nlow the structure illustrated in Figure  3.5 . \n\n In fact, the descriptive chart of each WP must include the key features of the activ-\nity it describes: the beginning and end of the activity, responsibility, objective of the \nactivity, input elements for starting up the activity and results, con fi guration, and \nespecially a description of the activity. \n\n The descriptive quality of the project WBS and WPs is the keystone of quality for \nproject planning. Its level of detail must not neglect elements which could be under-\nestimated in a critical way during the development phase. \n\n After a systematic structuring of the WBS and relative WPs, the third essential \naspect is the explanation of the time management of the plan which is an integral part \nof the de fi nition of the WPs in which the resulting sum of the \u201cdate of start-up\u201d and \n\u201c fi nal date\u201d express the overall duration of the program. \n\n Figure  3.6  illustrates a time plan regarding a development project for a highly \ncomplex telecommunication satellite (the duration for the realization of a commercial \nsatellite weighing 6\u20138 tons at takeoff and generally lasting 4\u20135 years). \n\n The three elements described above quantify the material and human resources \nrequired for realizing the program. This process is extremely important since it allows \nthe Program Manager to pick out the so-called \u201ccritical path,\u201d which is the mix of \nhuman resources and timetable of basic activities which must be absolutely achieved \nto limit delays and/or cost overruns to the maximum level. \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3755-0_2\n\n\n104 Space Program

(Continued)\n\nMarketing of Space Programs\n\n\n\n110 Space Program Management\n\n Obviously, the Program Manager must have a cost chart for each WP to construct \nhis own costs actively (and therefore the resulting price) and to be able to monitor it \nduring the development of the various activities. \n\n Once the WBS, the WP descriptions, the time management planning and cost data \ndetails (the overall Management Plan) have been de fi ned in the offer phase, the \nProgram Manager will have to stick to a tight and constant monitoring of the progress \nof the program\u2019s various activities.  \n\n    3.5.   The Space Program Contract \n\n After the negotiation process has been completed following the presentation of the \noffer, the contract is signed if the offer has been accepted. The contract clauses are \nthe subject of contract negotiation. \n\n Therefore, an agreement is contracted which creates obligations on both sides, the \nsupplier and the customer. \n\n The obligations, responsibilities and rights of each party, which usually are the only \ntwo involved in the contract framework, must be clearly described and speci fi ed. \n\n However, there are cases, such as in the contract for Ariane launch services, in which \nthe agreement signed between the parties, Arianespace which supplies the service and \nthe customers, involve third party obligations, in this speci fi c case the French govern-\nment, should the European launcher taking off from French territory with a satellite of \nany nationality on board cause any problem to a third territory. Likewise, concerning the \nEuropean launcher Vega, with a majority of Italian participation, even the Italian state \nand in a lesser way, ESA, are partially responsible for damages to third parties. \n\n With regard to the unambiguous nature of the contract, both the customer and \n supplier have a clear interest in not having uncertainties in the agreement. \n\n In fact, the customer must:\n\n   Precisely detail the nature of the program, expressing the technical speci fi cations \u2022 \nto assign responsibilities to the supplier.  \n  Be able to follow the progress of the activities through a detailed calendar of infor-\u2022 \nmative steps, for example.  \n  Provide details of payment modalities in order to design his own investment \u2022 \nplan.    \n\n While the supplier must:\n\n   Avoid the risk of having the product refused because of noncompliance.  \u2022 \n  Have the customer de fi ne the nature of the technical control chosen to assign \u2022 \nresponsibility to the customer himself for accepting the supply of product.  \n  Know in detail the budget restrictions set down by the payment plan in order to \u2022 \nplan for activities.    \n\n In any case, as a general rule, we can say a program has been started up only when \nthe contract has been signed. \n\n However, space activities often include contract procedures which for reasons of \ncommercial need or planned institutional funding, involve legal and  fi nancial negotia-\ntions while technical activities have already been started. \n\n\n\n111Marketing of Space Programs\n\n This procedure, usually based on reciprocal trust (in the commercial case, for exam-\nple, between a satellite operator and a manufacturer who has already realized satellites \nfor the operator) or in a guaranteed institutional framework (for example, in the frame-\nwork of space agency programs whose funding is already planned) is based on a letter \nof intent, called the ATP, \u201cAuthorization To Proceed\u201d which allows the supplier to begin \nwork and assigns responsibility to the customer through a preliminary order. \n\n In the space market, the types of contracts are standardized, on the one hand, in \nthe framework of the space agencies and, on the other hand, have a looser structure, \nfor example in the commercial market for launch services or for the realization of \ncommunication satellites. \n\n Given the sector\u2019s speci fi cities, suppliers make up a restricted group on the global \nscale and their technical competence is generally well known. \n\n Basically, we can identify the following types of contracts:\n\n   Firm and  fi xed cost  \u2022 \n  At cost  \u2022 \n  Incentive    \u2022 \n\n      Firm and Fixed Price Contract \n\n In the  fi rm and  fi xed price contract, the supplier and the customer agree to a value of \nthe price, which is de fi nitively established when the contract is signed. \n\n Every WP clearly explains its cost, and in the case of contracts with ESA the \n margin is in fact preestablished in the making of cost data (called \u201ccost sheets\u201d). \n\n The supplier therefore commits to supplying a product for the price established \nwhatever his realization cost might be. \n\n De fi ning  R  0  as the cost of realization estimated at the date of the contract and  M  0  \nas the corresponding estimated pro fi t, the price     0 0P R M= +    can go two ways \naccording to whether the real development cost  R  is lesser or greater to  R  0 . \n\n In the  fi rst case, the supplier increases his margin and the customer pays more for \nhis work and in the second case the supplier sees his margin decreased and must face \nprogram risks (Figure  3.9 ). \n\n With cost estimate analytical methods the two borderline cases are kept under \ncontrol and so this type of contract is often used in large space programs. \n\n Should there be unforeseen changes of the contract during the course of the program, \nor should there be new requests on the part of the customer, or if the supplier considers \nthat for various reasons he cannot meet several contractual obligations, \u201ccontract \nmodi fi cations\u201d or \u201cChange Requests\u201d are made. The price is reviewed and the supplier \nreformulates his price on the basis of contract variation which becomes effective when \nthe parties sign a contract variation called the CCN, \u201cContract Change Notice.\u201d \n\n This type of program is very widespread in European and its use has almost \nbecome a standard practice for ESA.  \n\n      Reimbursement Contract \n\n In a reimbursement contract the expenditures of the supplier are paid by the customer \nand in his agreement during the work progress, and the supplier\u2019s pro fi t, previously \nde fi ned, does not depend on the  fi nal cost of the activity. \n\n\n\n112\n\nM\n\nM\n\nM0\n\nRR R0\n\nP\n\nM\n\nM0\n\nM\n\nRR0 R\n\nP\n\nWhen cost price R is below R0, the\nsupplier increases financial margin and the\ncustomer overpays\n\nWhen cost price R is above R0, the\nsupplier has decresed financial margin and\ntakes on all risks linked to overproduction\n\n  Figure 3.9.    General  fi rm and  fi xed price model.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n The supplier commits himself to the best, but the customer reserves the right to verify \nthe basis of an invoice presented and to reject it should it be considered too costly. \n\n From the customer\u2019s point of view, the contract cannot be limited to a passive \nacceptance of invoice with subsequent payment, but rather involves a close critical \nanalysis. \n\n Therefore, this implies that the customer must have a technical and  fi nancial struc-\nture which can competently evaluate the supplier\u2019s operations and for a space pro-\ngram this implies that a customer (for example, a space agency) must have the \nmanagement resources equal or very close to the supplier (for example, a large \nindustry). \n\n From the point of view of the supplier, this type of contract protects the industry \nfrom sudden variations in development costs; for example, the effect of unforeseen \ntechnical modi fi cations. The supplier could also  fi nd an advantage in increasing costs \nwithout an apparent increase of his own margins to the customer, but since an \nincrease in volume of activity also increases the cost of general expenditures, in \nwhich the supplier allocates important positions of economic bene fi t, the general \nmargins increase without involving work teams. \n\n On the other hand, a supplier might not want to increase costs related to the techni-\ncal improvement of the program, in other words the supplier strives for an optimal \nrelation of price/performance since his margin has been preestablished. \n\n \n\n\n\n113Marketing of Space Programs\n\n This type of contract is often used when the margins of uncertainty of a program \nare so high that the supplier, or the customer, estimates unacceptable risk in determining \na  fi rm and  fi xed price. \n\n Its implementation could seem unfavorable at  fi rst glance to both parties since the \nincrease in costs could be caused by unforeseen elements. On the other hand, its \n fl exibility makes it a useful tool for managing adjustments during the course of the \nprogram by redirecting the necessary WPs more easily. \n\n This type of contract is very widespread in the USA for government contracts, \nboth civilian and military, in which uncertainty margins are sometimes high due to \nthe vast amount of development requirement; for example, the management of a \nhuman exploration program or an advanced military technological program.  \n\n      Incentive Contract \n\n As we have previously stated, it is not a good idea to sign a  fi xed and  fi rm contract \nwhen you have many program uncertainties and the subsequent use of cost contract \nrepresents a solution which, however, has the cost of introducing the lack of \nuncertainties. \n\n However, it is a solution which can lead to overcoming or signi fi cantly reducing \nthe progress and ef fi ciency of the program. \n\n This occurs when the incentive formula is used because the firm and fixed price \ncan rise for many reasons, being some risks intrinsically possible; thus this price \naugmentation is managed on the basis of a detailed verifications of the planned objec-\ntives and of the achieved results. \n\n For example, the formula with respect to delivery times is one of the incentive \ninstruments. As a rule of thumb, a contract should respect the time commitments \ncontained in it. \n\n Therefore, such a formula for incentives could appear incongruent. \n In any case in space programs, for example the commercial supply of \u201cturn-key\u201d \n\nsatellites, launch service and ground stations where contract terms are often \u201ctight\u201d due \nto commercial competition, the customer can often  fi nd it bene fi cial to award the supplier \na bonus equal to the delay penalty should the supplier deliver by the foreseen date. \n\n Another type of incentive is based on performance, a goal related to the ef fi ciency \nof the product requested. \n\n For example, the mass of a satellite or the performance of a launcher can be values \nindicated in a  fi rm- and  fi xed-type contract but with a clause that provides a supplemen-\ntary payment should the dry weight of a satellite be reduced (the mass without fuel).  \n\n      Plan and Payment Conditions \n\n The payment plan is one of the key elements for the parties because:\n\n   The customer plans the spending of his own resources, capital or debt, according \u2022 \nto the modalities of disbursement.  \n  The supplier plans his activities for developing and acquiring external sources \u2022 \naccording to the availability of  fi nancial resources.    \n\n\n\n114\n\nt\n\nP\n\nExpense curve\n\nNegotiated expense curve\n\n  Figure 3.10.    Time and expense/payment curves relation.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n Therefore, the following items must be de fi ned in a contract:\n\n   The steps technically agreed upon for payments; in general these are important steps \u2022 \nin the life of the program, the review or milestones with signi fi cant decisions.  \n  The foreseen dates of these steps and therefore payments.  \u2022 \n  The amounts which will be paid by the customer after accepting the product.    \u2022 \n\n In general, the contract negotiation involves two steps, Figure  3.10 :\n\n   The time schedule payment pro fi le according to industrial costs and budget avail-\u2022 \nability (expense curve) is de fi ned in the  fi rst step.  \n  In the second step the pro fi les are adjusted with subsequent repetitions, creating \u2022 \nceilings according to the milestone-time-budget mix (negotiated expense \ncurve).    \n\n During the course of negotiation when the two curves tend to decrease their \n\u201cdetachment,\u201d we can then put the payment timetable into the contract which \nindicates:\n\n   The key event for making payment.  \u2022 \n  The scheduled date of the key event.  \u2022 \n  The amount to be paid at the scheduled date.    \u2022 \n\n      Price Review \n\n Contract negotiations are often dif fi cult and complex concerning this point. \n In fact, there are  fi nancial developments which do not depend on the willingness \n\nof either party; for example, the  fi nancial variation through the years of the euro and \ndollar ratio often in fl uences the development of the price foreseen in a contract for \nrealizing a multi-year space program. \n\n The supplier who is committed to a  fi rm and  fi xed price at a certain date wants \nto justly guard against the risk related to the above  fi nancial development which \n\n \n\n\n\n115Marketing of Space Programs\n\ncan come about at any time once the contract is signed and the scheduled key \nevents. \n\n In addition to the normal insurance procedures against exchange risks which \nin any case involve a series of added costs to the supplier, there are two \npossibilities:\n\n   So-called  \u2022 updating rate  in which the price is realigned with the economic \n conditions of a preestablished time after the signing of the contract; for exam-\nple, after 3 months, and then becomes  fi rm and  fi xed for the remainder of the \ncontract. This procedure is usually applied when the contract will not last more \nthan a year.  \n  The so-called  \u2022 revision  in which the price is realigned at preestablished milestones \naccording to revision formulas. This procedure is often applied to long-term \nprograms.    \n\n The parameters necessary to the revision are the date when the price is established \nunder the initial economic conditions and the revision formula. \n\n The revision formula is often of this type:\n\n  P  =  P 0 ( a  +  bB/B 0 +  cC/C 0 +  dD/D 0 +\u2026)       \n\nwhere\n\n    P  is the revised price.  \n   P  0  is the initial price.  \n   B  0 ,  C  0 ,  D  0  are the values of the most representative indices of the elements which \n\nmade up the price on the original date.  \n   B ,  C ,  D  are the values of these indices at dates  fi xed in the contract and is the part \n\n fi xed by price, that is, not subject to revision. \n b ,  c ,  d  represent the component of various elements making up the price, where \n\n a  +  b  +  c  +  d  = 1      .     \n\n The de fi nition of the formula therefore gives values to the parameters according to \nthe relative estimates of the programs\u2019 various steps towards completion.                   \n\n\n\n117M.

The customer can therefore be a \ngovernment agency or private company, a national or international organization.  \n  The agent: frequently the customer, but if he (the customer) does not have all or part of \u2022 \nthe competences needed for the start-up or the management of the program, these could \nbe assigned to an agent, an administrative or private, who interfaces with suppliers.  \n  Industrial architect: this could be an industry or a government agency. Because of \u2022 \nhis recognized competence, he is called upon by the customer or the agent to \nde fi ne the architecture of the overall space system to coordinate various activities \nand to monitor the realization or production (for instance, in the case ESA for the \nGalileo program, or especially in the case of the French agency CNES for Ariane \nlaunchers).  \n  The Prime Contractor: an industry or consortium of industries which receive the \u2022 \nstudy and development contract of the program from the customer or agent and \nwho puts the program staff together to develop the program.  \n  The suppliers who receive contracts from the Prime Contractor to supply devices \u2022 \nand subsystems.    \n\n Figure  4.1  provides a chart of the contract  fl ow of the players of the European \ndevelopment program for the Galileo satellite navigation system. \n\n In the complex organization put into place for this program, the FOC (Full Orbital \nConstellation) phase for realizing and launching the thirty Galileo satellites the \nfollowing structure was con fi gured:\n\n   The European Commission, through Transport Direction, is the customer. After a \u2022 \n fi rst phase of government funding provided by the European Space Agency \n(ESA), the next phase, the FOC, was funded by the European Commission which \nreplaced ESA as the funding agency and therefore, de fi nitively as the customer.  \n  ESA became a player midway between an agent (which is being increasingly \u2022 \nassimilated to the European Commission) and the industrial architect to whom the \nCommission assigned the task for realizing the system.  \n  Six industries through targeted contracts act as Prime Contractors for the network \u2022 \nof relative activities (space segment, launch services, ground segment, etc.).  \n\n    Chapter 4   \n\n Methods and Tools of Space \nPrograms Management               \n\n\n\n118\n\nEuropean \nCommission\n\nDG Transport\n\nPrime Contractor\nESA\n\nAuthority for \nSupervision\n\nGSA\n\nFirst industrial sub-contractor\nSpace Segment\n\nThird industrial sub-contractor\nSystem Engineering\n\nFifth industrial sub-contractor\nMission Control\n\nFourth industrial sub-contractor\nControl  Ground Stations\n\nSixth industrial sub-contractor\nOperations\n\nSecond industrial sub-contractor \nLaunch services\n\n  Figure 4.1.

Organization of the Program Team \n\n A space program is part of an industrial organization called upon for its realization. \n The typical organization of an industry is often based on Business Lines (or \n\nProduct Lines if it is highly specialized), which characterize the nature of its activi-\nties; this organization is a permanent descriptive element, it rarely changes and only \nwhen there are signi fi cant changes in the  fi rm\u2019s strategy. \n\n A program, no matter what its importance and volume are, is limited in time \nand rarely become directly part of the company\u2019s internal organization. Instead, it \ndevelops a close network of relationships with the company executive and technical \nstructures. \n\n Due to its peculiar nature, a program is generally part of a high-level decision-\nmaking Technical Unit. It is part of Business Lines and directly connected to the \ncompany\u2019s management. \n\n \n\n\n\n119\n\nBusiness Unit A\nProduct A\n\nBusiness Unit B\nProduct  B\n\nExternal \nCompany D\n\nExternal \nCompany C\n\nProgram\n\n  Figure 4.2.    Example of the internal organization of a program.       \n\nMethods and Tools of Space Programs Management \n\n      Matrix Structure of the Program \n\n This type of organization is generally adopted because it allows for the effective \nmanagement of a program by safeguarding the objectives of the company structure. \n\n The principle of function includes:\n\n   A program team assigned with the management responsibility and therefore \u2022 \nachieving the goals of the program. The team, through its leader, the Program \nManager, is authorized by management and is directly accountable to it.  \n  A series of technical units of the company structure which is responsible for \u2022 \nrealizing activities according to their competence and which therefore act outside \nthe program and have different industrial objectives (even though they generally \nconverge).  \n  A series of external companies that are assigned various realization activities, \u2022 \nwhich are not awarded a contract within the company structure of the program.    \n\n The program team is therefore organized to cover adequately technical and admin-\nistrative needs. \n\n Figure  4.2  illustrates this type of organization, which can obviously be also \napplied to the agent as well as to a Prime Contractor. \n\n In a company with a certain amount of repetitive work, for example, a manufac-\nturing industry, which builds many commercial satellites for various customers, many \nprograms can lead to a greater ef fi ciency of the company structure in which several \nservices become common to several programs. \n\n For example, a system team or a Technical Unit of AIT, Assembly Integration & \nTest, can be created univocally and then be used on an ad hoc basis for each program. \n\n Figure  4.3  shows an example of the possible organization of a program for making \na commercial telecommunications satellite. \n\n \n\n\n\n120\n\nProgram \nManager\n\nSystem Engineer\n\nSatellite engineer\n\nLaunch and  LEOP \nengineer\n\nElectrical \nArchitecture \n\nengineer\n\nMechanical \nArchitecture \n\nengineer\n\nPayload engineer\n\nLauncher Interface \nengineer\n\nOrbital Operations \nengineer\n\nAssembly, \nIntegration & Test \n\nengineer\n\nProgram \nManager\n\nSYSTEM\n\nPAYLOAD\n\nASSEMBLY, \nINTEGRATION & \n\nTEST\n\nStructure\nThermal\nPower Supply\nTelemetry & Command\nApogee Motor\nAttitude Orbit Control\n\nTransponders\nAntennae\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nCONTRACT\n\nPLATFORM\n\nQuality\nManager\n\nQuality \nManager\n\nContract\nManager\n\n  Figure 4.3.

These \nactivities are mainly the \u201csystem management\u201d and the \u201cinterface management.\u201d \nIn other words, since a program can undergo delays due to the lack of a component \nfrom an external source, or even from internal sources, the management of this \ndelay is the Program Manager\u2019s task when this problem surfaces.  \n  De fi ne the tasks and responsibilities of Technical Units without violating the com-\u2022 \npany policy of these units that report hierarchically to another direction/unit.  \n  Establish the priorities of the program development.  \u2022 \n  De fi ne the quality rules and ensure their control.    \u2022 \n\n At the management level, the Program Manager must:\n\n   Respect the overall planning of the program indicated in the Management Plan, \u2022 \nbeginning with the various individual plans from components to system level, \nensuring their development  \n  De fi ne the measurement of planning control  \u2022 \n  Manage the con fi guration of documentation  \u2022 \n  Ensure necessary compromises between the elements of the program, which do \u2022 \nnot usually converge, such as technical speci fi cations, delays, and costs    \n\n At the commercial and contract level, the Program Manager must relate to the \ncustomer and ensure the proper ratio of reciprocal satisfaction, as well as to subsup-\npliers to ensure the proper production  fl ow. \n\n It seems obvious that choosing the Program Manager is a very important decision \nthat the company\u2019s administration must take by considering the competences and \ninternal and external context in which the person will have to operate. \n\n A Program Manager must have not only the right technical competences but also \nand especially wide-ranging knowledge. \n\n A technical specialist background will certainly be a special element, since the \nperson will be able to better understand the viewpoint of the various technical units \ninvolved, but he will have to know how to put aside this background in various \ncircumstances in order to reach quick solutions, without damaging the technical \nquality of the  fi nal product. \n\n With the proper spirit of synthesis, a good Program Manager must be able to \nrapidly understand what is being presented to him and be able to resolve problems, \nanalyzing the real problems from presumed ones. \n\n For example, a technical unit often supplies a device or subsystem with subsequent \nmodi fi cations or improvements that are considered tools for a more ef fi cient product. \nIn these cases, the Program Manager must be able to distinguish when \u201cperfection \n\n\n\n122 Space Program Management\n\nbecomes the enemy of good,\u201d he must be able to reject attractive techniques when he \nconsiders that program planning could be impacted in some way because of further \ntesting required or the lack of operational expertise. \n\n Having a humane attitude before a professional one is a necessary requirement for \na Program Manager who must motivate, inform, and lead the team with sternness \nwhen necessary. These are all qualities that are developed only after many years of \ntechnical or management work within complex organizations. \n\n The program team which follows the work, each one with limited objectives, with \nrespect to the Program Manager\u2019s, contributes to guiding the Technical or \nAdministration Units towards achieving single objectives; in essence, the realization \nof the program. \n\n It cannot be denied that for systems and subsystems managers, participation in a \ncomplex program is an essential career step, opening the way to solving broader \nranging problems that are part of the Program Manager\u2019s tasks, thereby increasing \nknowledge and experience for those aspiring to higher roles.   \n\n    4.2.   Management of Performance and Margins \n\n When a space program is started up, there are a series of uncertainties regarding \nrealization capability that correspond to the management\u2019s requirement to adequately \nprovide the  fi nal product with the initial requirements and those that appeared during \nthe course of the program. \n\n For example, let us consider the dif fi culty of accurately predicting the mass at \nlaunch of a commercial telecommunications satellite with a \u00b15% margin at the time \nthe contract is signed for purchasing the satellite. The contract is signed on average 3 \nor 4 years before the launch and its price depends on the mass of this satellite. \n\n Beginning with the conception and de fi nition phase of a program we tend to \nseek guarantees which are technically obtained by introducing variations, called \n\u201cmargins,\u201d between the nominal value of a parameter (its speci fi c value from require-\nments) and the one which is considered more probable. \n\n The evaluation of the more probable value can depend on historical elements, from \nhaving already developed similar data in the past for other programs or from measur-\ning elements or more often from numerical simulation. \n\n The task of the program team is to de fi ne margins within reason neither excessively \nnor insuf fi ciently, see Figure  4.4  that can be adapted to various program phases. \n\n For example, in the previously mentioned case of the telecommunications satellite, \nthe relative margins of the mass at launch can usually pass from \u00b110 to \u00b120% at the \nbeginning of the program to \u00b11 kg or \u00b15 kg a few days before the  fi nal fuel-up of \nthe satellite tanks, the phase which completes the  fi nal ground operations of the \nsatellite and which is then followed by the transport of the satellite to the head of \nthe launcher. \n\n      Analysis of the Margins for Different Program Phases \n\n Phases A and B of a space program in which the system speci fi cations are determined \nwill be examined  fi rst, the typical conditions of the space segment to be undertaken. \n\n\n\n123\n\nmargin\n\nEstimated final value\n\nCalculated value at the \nend of development\n\nOn ground \nmeasurement\n\nPerformance \n(in flight measurement)\n\nRequirement\n\n  Figure 4.4.

In fact, at the start-up of the program the system budgets \nare de fi ned which determine the key parameters with margins. \n\n Optimization can also be de fi ned as a process that guarantees the adequacy of the \nmargins and has them ideally converge to zero at the end of the program. \n\n In order to illustrate the process, we will consider the case of a telecommunication \nsatellite. \n\n Since it concerns a commercial satellite, the manufacturer has a structure, called a \nsatellite platform that is the basic \u201cchassis\u201d on which to conceive, realize, and inte-\ngrate the \u201cpayload,\u201d the panels of radiofrequency repeaters and antennas. \n\n The program mission de fi nes the general speci fi cations in terms of communication capa-\nbility. This means to know the emitting capability, expressed in watts, of each repeater we \nmust de fi ne the right number of repeaters that can be located on the available platform. \n\n We know the maximum mass of the satellite when it is launched which also \ndepends on the launch capability of the launcher (further condition); we know the \nmaximum capacity of the platform tanks and we therefore de fi ne the mass budget as \nthe variation between the maximum realizable value and the one calculated according \nto the structural size of the platform. \n\n Intrinsically connected to the mass budget is the fuel budget, the variation between \nthe possible mass within the tanks and the one calculated according to the propulsion \nparameters of the motor to ensure the satellite reaches  fi nal orbit and then achieves \nthe corrections to stationing for a minimum of 10 or more years. \n\n See Figure  4.6  for a partial series of potential margins to be taken into \nconsideration. \n\n We can also de fi ne the available power on board the satellite by optimizing the \nnumber of couples of single elements of the solar panels. \n\n By knowing the power of the each couple of elements, the thermal dispersion and \nabsorption capacity of the platform, we can de fi ne the power budget as a maximum \nachievable value and the one calculated as necessary for the functioning of the vari-\nous subsystems. \n\n \n\n\n\n125\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nDiverging margins\n\nConverging margins\n\nNon feasible mission\n\nFeasible mission\n\nNumber of missions\n\nMargins\n\n  Figure 4.7.    Visual parameter analysis of the budgets of a telecommunications satellite.       \n\nMethods and Tools of Space Programs Management \n\n The process of optimization is done by using    these and other budgets, and by essen-\ntially de fi ning the optimal number of repeaters, we can simulate various con fi gurations \nfor the satellite, and for each con fi guration budget are calculated for mass, fuel, power. \nSee Figure  4.7  to visualize (number of repeaters on the horizontal axis) by which \nnumber the budget margins are reduced simultaneously. \n\n Sometimes a probability can be connected to the value of a margin or a key param-\neter; for example, in the case of the satellite one of the mission requirements could be \nto ensure a margin of 2 dB on the power emitted during 99% of a determined period \nof the year. \n\n The main system budgets for a telecommunications satellite, the ones that must be \nde fi ned with appropriate margins, must not become negative since this would cause \nthe mission to deteriorate or to become impossible are the following:\n\n   Mission budget  \u2022 \n  Mass budget  \u2022 \n  Fuel budget  \u2022 \n  Electric power budget  \u2022 \n  Communication or link budget  \u2022 \n  Number of tele-commands from ground  \u2022 \n  Electromagnetic compatibility budget    \u2022 \n\n However, there is a margin with a numerical value or probability value as stated \npreviously for these budgets. \n\n For example, usually a fuel budget leads to optimizing the maximum quantity of \nfuel needed to have the 99.7% possibility of ensuring the satellite mission for its \nduration and in this case, the margin is simply the difference between the value \ncalculated and maximum capacity of its tanks. \n\n In this case, the budget can then be optimized to ensure the fuel margin during the \norbital life of the satellite, so it does not stop at the realization and launch phase. \n\n \n\n\n\n126\n\n  Figure 4.8.    Visual breakdown of the mass budget of a telecommunication satellite.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n In calculating the margins, we often experience dif fi culties related to the presence \nof so-called reference levels that come from different sources. \n\n A Prime Contractor of a satellite could autonomously determine its margins:\n\n   According to the technical requirements of the contract with the customer to \u2022 \nensure, for example, a margin on the electric power at the end life of the satellite  \n  According to the contract requirements but which can be modi fi ed and have a \u2022 \n fi nancial impact. For example, the increase of the margin for the mass budget at \nlaunch is critical for possible increases in price of the launcher, especially during \n fi nal realization phases  \n  According to results measured for previous  fl ights; for example in the case of \u2022 \nvibration levels measured during launches  \n  According to state-of-the-art technology    \u2022 \n\n Since a space system, satellite, launcher or infrastructure, can rarely be fully \nascribed to previous programs, reference margins are taken into consideration by \nbreaking down the system into subsystems and devices. \n\n With the case of the telecommunication satellite still in mind, the breakdown of \nvarious subsystems is parametrically visualized in Figure  4.8  as an example. \n\n A rather practical rule is to apply a knowledge level, from 0 to 5 for example, for \neach subsystem and to attribute a percentage of error on the estimate or knowledge \nof the value concerning the subsystem; see Figure  4.9 . \n\n \n\n\n\n127\n\nConfidence \nlevel\n\nEstimated \nmass (kg)\n\nIncertitude (Kg)\n(0.02 x confidence level)\n\nPayload \n\nStructure\n\nPower supply\nElectrical units\nSolar panels\nBatteries\nControl electronics \n\nTelemetry & Telecommand\n\nAttitude Control\n\nTanks\n\nThermal control\n\nApogee motor (dry) including \nall components for structure\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n2\n2\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n300\n\n200\n\n50\n150\n120\n50\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n50\n\n80\n\n24\n\n12\n\n2\n6\n\n4,8\n1\n\n1,2\n\n1,6\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1,6\n\nEnd of Life (EoL) satellite mass\n\nPropellant to be consumed in orbit\n(function for lifetime = 0, 2)\n\nBeginning of Life (BoL) satellite mass\n(EoL mass + consumed propellant)\n\nPropellant mass to reach GEO orbit\n(function for circularization = 0, 7)\n\nLaunch mass\n\nMFV = 1360 kg + 59,2 kg\n\n0.2 x MFV =  0,2 x (1360 kg + 59,2 kg)\n\nMIV = (1360 kg + 272 kg) + (59,2 kg + 11,8 kg) =\n1632 kg + 71,04 kg\n\n0.7 x MIV = [0,7 x (1360 kg + 272 kg)] + [0,7 x\n(59,2 kg + 11,8 kg] = 1142,4 kg + 49,7 kg\n\nML = (1632 kg + 1142,4 kg) + (71,04 kg + 49,07 kg) =\n2623,14 kg \n\n  Figure 4.9.

Example of the power budget for a telecommunication satellite.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n We will now consider Phases C and D of a space program during which the system \nis realized. As we have seen previously in Phases A and B, the management of \nmargins is effected through numerical calculations, essentially simulations, and pro-\ngressively with measurements as the state of de fi nition and realization of the product \nallows it. \n\n In development phases C and D, the management of the margins is done with the \ndirect measurement of its parameters and the aid of special documentation, the so-\ncalled \u201ccon fi guration,\u201d a tool for following its development and for making \nadjustments. \n\n Figures  4.10  and  4.11  still illustrate the management of budget margins for power \nand mass budget for a telecommunication satellite. \n\n During Phases C and D obviously, as we proceed towards the material \ndevelopment of the system, margins risk being \u201cconfused\u201d with the tolerances or \nwith the project assumptions and this can cause confusion between the supplier \nand the customer because of various interpretations of the same parameter. This is \nwhy it is wise to specify the rules clearly which de fi ne the type of system margins in \nthe contract. \n\n In Phase E then, the use of the system in space, the development of several \nmargins, for example, related to the fuel budget, can be checked through telemetry \ndata to plan orbit adjustments to obtain the lifetime duration speci fi ed in the contract. \n\n Therefore, at levels of a space program, from the device to the subsystem to the \ncomplete system, margins are calculated which contribute to the optimization of \nthe budgets. See the simpli fi ed model in Figure  4.12 . \n\n It is theoretically rather complicated to produce a system at the end of the program \nthat is perfectly congruent to the project measurement, but it is the objective of the \nProgram Manager to reduce this variation to the smallest degree possible. \n\n In the organization of a program it has already been seen how a program team \nproceeds downward hierarchically or functionally to the single supplier or device, \n\n \n\n\n\n129\n\nSatellite lift off mass\n\nLauncher performance\n\nMaximum satellite  dry mass\n\nNominal satellite dry mass\n\n  Figure 4.11.

Analysis of margin accumulation.       \n\nMethods and Tools of Space Programs Management \n\nwhether they are inside the industrial structure of the program or outside, that is, other \ncompanies. \n\n Each manager supplying a device or subsystem will be taking a margin on his own \nsupply that will probably not be known to his hierarchical superior. \n\n This human attitude is completely understandable and universally accepted. In any \ncase, every margin is taken according to different evaluation criteria, often according \nto the attitude of single individuals who might be under pressure from their hierarchical \nsuperiors. \n\n However, as a consequence, there will be an overall margin that is not completely \nidenti fi able at the program level, i.e., an unknown variable. \n\n We can then ask the question whether there is a procedure on the part of the \nprogram team for sharing these \u201cunknown margins\u201d to redistribute them for the \nbene fi t of the entire program. \n\n Realistically this is not possible and in effect the accumulation of these hidden \nmargins is the guarantee every manager at his own level takes on for his supply. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n130 Space Program Management\n\n Consequently, the practicality of \u201cmargin management\u201d consists in following in \ndetail the development of the key parameters of the program, and especially to adopt \nchoices that are often dif fi cult when we observe the possibility of running into a \nnegative margin. \n\n Let us consider a speci fi c case for a telecommunication satellite to illustrate a \npractical example for managing margins. If the mass of an encased electronic com-\nponent were high, we would reduce the thickness of the metallic casing or even change \nthe material of the coating to carbon  fi ber to lighten the overall weight. \n\n For a subsystem we could decide, for commercial requirements, to increase the \nmargin of the power budget emitted by a repeater on board when the subsystem has \nalready been realized. This requirement could require substituting the coaxial guide \nbetween the emission and the antenna with a weaker guide. \n\n We would therefore transfer margins at the subsystem level, increasing the power \nbudget and decreasing the mass budget. \n\n This is an example of the interdependence of the margins and the critical nature of \nmanagement that must have a profound knowledge of the system to be realized. \n\n At the system level, a further example could be to calculate that even by substi-\ntuting the guide in the previous case, the power emitted by the subsystem would not \nbe enough to cover the commercial requirement. Should we not be able to intervene, \nat the level of the subsystem on the antennas, we would need to intervene at the \nhigher system level. \n\n We could operate on the link budget that is also a function of the station-keeping \nwidth of the satellite. By reducing this width, the fuel mass should be increased to \nallow an increase in the orbital maneuvers for adjustment. Consequently, this would \nincrease the total mass budget at launch which, however, will have to remain within \nthe limits imposed by the launcher (unless we renegotiate the price of the launch if \nthere is a signi fi cant increase in mass), as well as for the limitations imposed by the \ncapacity of the satellite tanks. \n\n This transfer practice of margins is used frequently in programs. As we have stated \npreviously, it must include a profound knowledge of the system.   \n\n    4.3.   Con fi guration Management \n\n Con fi guration management of a space program is aimed at maintaining document \ncontrol of the technical de fi nition of the system, subsystems, and devices throughout \nthe life of the program. For this reason, the program team will have to produce, \nmaintain, and update all documents that will allow it to have a precise vision of the \nelements that make up the system they have to develop. \n\n The  fi rst function of con fi guration management is therefore to identify the docu-\nments of the speci fi cations and technical requirements. \n\n Since there is a converging time consistency among the various devices/subsystems \nfor the duration of the program, the Program Manager cannot manage this consis-\ntency without knowing about its component elements. This is why the second funda-\nmental function of con fi guration management is planning. \n\n The Con fi guration manager, inside a program team, will thus have to establish, in \naccordance with planning, a parallel path of control and veri fi cation of the documents \n\n\n\n131Methods and Tools of Space Programs Management \n\nto allow the team to be able to identify the technical status of the system, subsystem \nor device, at any given moment of the program. \n\n The third function of Con fi guration management is the control of the con fi guration \nstatus itself, that is to follow the development of the program elements through previ-\nously authorized subsequent modi fi cations that have had repercussions on the program. \n\n Identi fi cation, planning and control, and lastly the veri fi cation and insertion of \ndevelopments or modi fi cations make up the three essential functions of con fi guration \nmanagement. \n\n      Methodology of the Con fi guration Management \n\n      Identi fi cation Function \n This is accomplished by drawing up speci fi c technical documents, controlled and \nnumbered in con fi guration, and which are slowly updated during the course of the \nprogram and are approved at decisive moments such as the review. \n\n The Con fi guration of each element, from the devices to the entire system, must \nprovide for a series of documents including, at the least, the following:\n\n   Technical Speci fi cations (requirements)  \u2022 \n  De fi nition Document or DD  \u2022 \n  Production and Control Document or PCD  \u2022 \n  Interface Control Document or ICD    \u2022 \n\n Any element can be identi fi ed when we have these documents, which in synthesis \nallow us to trace the history, development, modi fi cation, and current status at the end \nof the program. Of the four documents, all of them equally important, the DD and the \nICD are of particular relevance. \n\n In the DD, the system to be realized is broken down into all its components and \nidenti fi ed, while in the ICD all the relationships among the components of the system, \nboth internal and external program elements, are taken into consideration. \n\n Figure  4.13  shows an example of a possible index for a DD of a telecommunica-\ntion satellite program. \n\n The Interface Control Document is usually made up of two parts:\n\n   The  fi rst part, drawn up by the customer, de fi nes the system interface with the \u2022 \nexternal world, for example, laboratory tests, assembly rooms, launch base. Various \nfeatures are clari fi ed, such as:\n\n    \u2013 Axial reference systems  \n  Obstruction volumes under the launcher fairing   \u2013\n  External feeding connectors under the launcher fairing   \u2013\n  In-orbit con fi guration    \u2013\n  And so on.      \u2013\n\n  The second part, drawn up by the Prime Contractor or the program team, de fi nes \u2022 \nthe consistency of the system with the speci fi cations. Basically, starting with the \ndata from suppliers, for example, mechanical, thermal or structural models of a \ndevice, the Prime Contractor or the program team verify them with their integra-\ntion at system level, both possible and consistent.    \n\n\n\n132\n\nA \u2013 GENERAL ISSUES\nMaterial definition and identification (synthesis of design data for sub-\nsystems and equipments with technical reference number)  \n\nApplicable documents\nStatus of Configuration (preliminary, final, \u2026)\n\nB \u2013 SATELLITE GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nSub-systems functionalities\nDeployment plan\n\nPreparation to launch\nOrbital configuration\n\nDevelopment Plan\n\nC \u2013 TECHNICAL CARACTHERISTICS\nFunctional\nPerformance\nPhysical\n\nD \u2013 ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SCHEMES \n\nE \u2013 BUDGETS\nMechanical (reference axes, mass, inertia, alignment )\nThermal\nPower\nTelemetry & Telecommand\nOrbital accuracy\nLinks\n\u2026\n\nF \u2013 ORBITAL MANEUVERS\nOperative modes\nProcedures and constraints among operative modes \n\nG \u2013 LIMITS & CONSTRAINTS\nLife duration\nSecurity\nTransport and maintenance\n\n  Figure 4.13.

Their access is regulated by the original \nversion of each of them. In this way, each document can only be modi fi ed under \nthe sole responsibility of the person issuing it and without a written and catalogued \nevidence of the document, which caused the development. Usually the procedure is \nperformed in agreement not only with the customer, but also with the involvement \nof the suppliers. \n\n Figure  4.15  provides an example of the possible acquisition planning of the \ncon fi guration for a satellite. \n\n As we can see, the document list is cross-indexed with the temporal sequence of \nthe program reviews and according to the type of review we can have a picture of \nhow Con fi guration management evolves in time. \n\n As stated previously, during the course of the program\u2019s duration, the reviews \nmust be established to effect:\n\n   An in-depth evaluation of activities  \u2022 \n  An analysis of the documentation drawn up or the testing results taking into charge \u2022 \nof review group recommendations  \n  A status freeze of the Con fi guration    \u2022 \n\n Management procedures of Con fi guration can be divided into:\n\n   Internal management which refers to the management of documents of each single \u2022 \nplayer and which is not under the control of the program team (for example, a \nTechnical Unit that realizes a device for the program)  \n  Formal management of the con fi gured documents that is the responsibility of the \u2022 \nprogram team    \n\n At this point we can illustrate the developments of the Con fi guration documents \nby examining Figure  4.16 , which refers to ESA\u2019s standard procedures concerning the \nprogram\u2019s document list. \n\n The documents are formally managed at the end of the reviews, which are updated \nin the Con fi guration. \n\n The updates can be implemented during contractually de fi ned key moments but \nwhich generally coincide with program reviews.  \n\n\n\n136\n\nE\nQ\n\nU\nIP\n\nM\nE\n\nN\nT\n\nS\nP\n\nD\nR\n\n  \n  \n\nS\nU\n\nB\n-S\n\nY\nS\n\nT\nE\n\nM\nC\n\nD\nR\n\nF\nR\n\nR\nP\n\nH\nA\n\nS\nE\n\nB\nS\n\nY\nS\n\nT\nE\n\nM\nC\n\nD\nR\n\nA\nC\n\nC\nE\n\nP\nT\n\nA\nN\n\nC\nE\n\nR\nE\n\nV\nIE\n\nW\n\nS\nY\n\nS\nT\n\nE\nM\n\n \nR\n\nE\nQ\n\nU\nIR\n\nE\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\nS\n\nS\nU\n\nB\n-S\n\nY\nS\n\nT\nE\n\nM\nS\n\n \nR\n\nE\nQ\n\nU\nIR\n\nE\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\nS\n\nE\nQ\n\nU\nIP\n\nM\nE\n\nN\nT\n\nS\n \n\nR\nE\n\nQ\nU\n\nIR\nE\n\nM\nE\n\nN\nT\n\nS\n\nIN\nT\n\nE\nR\n\nF\nA\n\nC\nE\n\n \nC\n\nO\nN\n\nT\nR\n\nO\nL\n\n \nD\n\nO\nC\n\nU\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\n\nIN\nD\n\nU\nS\n\nT\nR\n\nIA\nL\n\n \nD\n\nO\nC\n\nU\nM\n\nE\nN\n\nT\nS\n\n1.\n E\n\nq\nu\n\nip\nm\n\nen\nts\n\n2.\n S\n\nu\nb\n\n-s\nys\n\nte\nm\n\ns\n3.\n\n S\nys\n\nte\nm\n\nD\nE\n\nF\nIN\n\nIT\nIO\n\nN\n \n\nD\nO\n\nC\nU\n\nM\nE\n\nN\nT\n\nS\n\n1.\n E\n\nq\nu\n\nip\nm\n\nen\nts\n\n2.\n S\n\nu\nb\n\n-s\nys\n\nte\nm\n\ns\n3.\n\n S\nys\n\nte\nm\n\nP\nre\n\nlim\nin\n\nar\ny \n\nD\nef\n\nin\niti\n\no\nn \n\nD\no\n\ncu\nm\n\nen\nt\n\nQ\nua\n\nlif\nic\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nD\n\no\ncu\n\nm\nen\n\nt\nA\n\ncc\nep\n\nta\nnc\n\ne \nan\n\nd \nP\n\nro\ndu\n\nct\nio\n\nn \nD\n\noc\num\n\nen\nt\n\nF\nea\n\nsi\nb\n\nili\nty\n\n D\no\n\ncu\nm\n\nen\nt\n\nC\non\n\nfig\nur\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nm\n\nan\nag\n\nem\nen\n\nt b\ny \n\nco\nnt\n\nra\nct\n\nor\ns\n\nC\non\n\nfig\nur\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nm\n\nan\nag\n\nem\nen\n\nt b\ny \n\nP\nro\n\ngr\nam\n\n \nin\n\ncl\nud\n\nin\ng \n\nal\nl m\n\nod\nifi\n\nca\ntio\n\nns\n\nS\nU\n\nB\n-S\n\nY\nS\n\nT\nE\n\nM\nS\n\nP\nD\n\nR\nS\n\nY\nS\n\nT\nE\n\nM\nP\n\nD\nR\n\nE\nQ\n\nU\nIP\n\nM\nE\n\nN\nT\n\nC\nD\n\nR\n\n  F\nig\n\nu\nre\n\n 4\n.1\n\n5.\n  \n\n  E\nxa\n\nm\np\n\nle\n o\n\nf \nth\n\ne \nd\n\nev\nel\n\no\np\n\nm\nen\n\nt \np\n\nla\nn\n\n o\nf \n\nco\nn\n\n fi\n g\n\nu\nra\n\nti\no\n\nn\n f\n\no\nr \n\na \nte\n\nle\nco\n\nm\nm\n\nu\nn\n\nic\nat\n\nio\nn\n\n s\nat\n\nel\nlit\n\ne.\n       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n \n\n\n\n137\n\nMDR PRR SRR PDR CDRDocuments\n\nFunctional System Requirements\n\nTechnical System Requirements\n\nRequirements Justification Document\n\nMission Feasibility Study\n\nManagement Plan\n\nRequirements & Specifications Document\n\nProduct Assurance Plan\n\nDefinition Document\n\nInterface Control Document\n\nConfiguration Control Document\n\nAssembly Integration & Test Plan\n\nissue 1 final issue\n\nissue 1 final issue\n\nissue 1 final issue\n\nissue 1 final issue\n\nIssue 1 revision final issue\n\nissue 1 final issue\n\nissue 1 revision final issue\n\nissue 1 final issue\n\nissue 1 final issue\n\nissue 1 final issue\n\nissue 1 final issue\n\n  Figure 4.16.

Example of a program modi fi cation proposal.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n The process of proposal and acceptance/refusal of the modi fi cations is managed \nin a formal manner. Each modi fi cation proposal is therefore processed according to \nstandards that can vary in different programs; however, the illustrated chart in \nFigure  4.17  represents its main features. \n\n \n\n\n\n139Methods and Tools of Space Programs Management \n\n In principle, every modi fi cation proposal should contain at least the following \nelements:\n\n   The number of modi fi cation proposals  \u2022 \n  The agency that proposes it  \u2022 \n  The impact of the modi fi cation on the documents managed in Con fi guration  \u2022 \n  The technical justi fi cations of cost and time impact    \u2022 \n\n The modi fi cation proposals are examined on two levels:  fi rstly the program team \nor the Prime Contractor, and secondly by a relevant committee in which the program \nteam with the customer analyzes the modi fi cation proposal and who jointly decree its \napproval or refusal. \n\n The process is similar to the closed control loop. \n The approval can be total or partial, in the sense that a modi fi cation can be \n\naccepted but in a limited way to a single device, for example, and not by the entire \nsubsystem as originally proposed. \n\n In each case the responsibility for the incorporation of a program modi fi cation \nmust always be communicated to and accepted by the customer.    \n\n    4.4.   Assembly, Integration, and Test Management \n\n In the management of space programs, the activity dedicated to tests is fundamental \nfor ensuring the convergence of the program to the originally de fi ned mission \nrequirements. \n\n The convergence is therefore expressed not only through numerical simulation but \nalso especially through true physical testing of the program elements, devices, and \nsubsystems up to the system. \n\n All the hardware and software of a space system is tested and measured at the \nlevel of:\n\n   Elementary components  \u2022 \n  Equipment or devices  \u2022 \n  Subsystems  \u2022 \n  Integrated systems  \u2022 \n  Interface with external elements    \u2022 \n\n Naturally, according to the type of the mission, the planning of the testing can be \ndifferent. \n\n In fact, it is evident that the nature of certain programs such as the scienti fi c probes \nor space systems with astronauts on board differs in complexity and redundancy with \nrespect to space launchers or commercial telecommunication satellites. This can lead \nto very different types of tests according to the varying criticality of the required \nveri fi cation. \n\n      Types of Tests \n\n The tests must verify the operational and functional conditions of the system elements \naccording to their performance for which these elements were designed inside the \nsystem itself. \n\n\n\n140 Space Program Management\n\n The tests can therefore satisfy these types of veri fi cations: \n\n      Functional \n This type of test is done with measurements, electric or radioelectric simulations \nusually in a laboratory or during testing under thermal void. The functional \nveri fi cation of the various subsystems is almost always performed in an integrated \nfashion with a test of electromagnetic compatibility. These tests are performed with \nappropriate test benches whose speci fi cations and realization are the responsibility of \nthe program team.  \n\n      Environmental \n This type of test is performed to verify the compatibility of system elements with \nonground operations before the launch; then with the launcher during the putting into \norbit phase; and  fi nally with the space environment, the location of the operations. \n\n Concerning ground operations, we must keep in mind that all the material will \nhave to be realized, stored, worked, and transported on Earth before  fl ying into space. \nTherefore, every element will be subject to transport and handling which will require \nestablishing conditions and restrictions in detail. \n\n Concerning the launcher, the tests will have provided the veri fi cation of mechan-\nical, structural, acoustic, and electromagnetic compatibilities of the system with the \nnoise and vibration conditions caused by the launcher. These conditions are usually \nwell known and are described in the \u201cuser\u2019s manual\u201d of various launch vehicles. \nThese tests are performed with both numerical simulations and with physical testing \nand mainly concern:\n\n   Mechanical and acoustic vibration tests  \u2022 \n  Shock tests or transitory acceleration test  \u2022 \n  Static tests  \u2022 \n  Inertia equilibrium tests    \u2022 \n\n Concerning the space environment once in orbit, the tests to be carried out on \nground involve verifying the system\u2019s resistance to thermal conditions in the cosmic \nvoid with and without solar radiation. For telecommunication satellites in geosta-\ntionary orbit, the veri fi cation test of the electrostatic charge and discharge is of major \nimportance given the fact that sidereal irradiation is not decreased by the Earth\u2019s \nmagnetic  fi eld or by the layers of the atmosphere. These tests are performed \nspeci fi cally under void and in thermal testing laboratories.  \n\n      Interface \n These tests, conducted through simulations, concern compatibility testing with other \nsystems, such as compatibility of communication between the satellite in low orbit \nand the onground station network for communications and control. \n\n Generally, testing philosophy for space programs tends to realize a prototype \nmodel of the system (satellite, spacecraft, or infrastructure) identical to the in- fl ight \nmodel to perform quali fi cation tests with de fi nite margins. \n\n This method usually ensures the best performances even in orbit but can present, \naccording to the program, the disadvantage of requiring greater development cost and \nmore time. \n\n\n\n141Methods and Tools of Space Programs Management \n\n The testing plan can be reduced; for example, in the case of pseudo-recurrent \nprogram, i.e., programs whose system uses platforms or subsystems already used in \nprevious programs and therefore well known at a functional level. \n\n However, in general, a test plan is established at the time the system is conceived \nfor the very reason the availability or not of adequate test means signi fi cantly \nin fl uence the choice of the project. \n\n In general, the program  fi rst asks speci fi c questions before establishing the test \nplan, such as what type of test is foreseen for a given element, and at what point of \nits realization? Which margins apply on the various tests that we want to carry out? \nWhat are the most adequate test instruments for verifying we wish to perform? How \ncan we be sure of the accuracy of the tests and therefore manage the quality of the \ninstruments and measurements?   \n\n      Test Planning and Methods \n\n Even the planning of tests for a space program is a formal process that must be \nde fi ned at the time of its conception and is part of the Management Plan. \n\n The tests are planned by de fi ning the relative technical documentation (speci fi cations, \nplanning) and control documentation (control, measurement, and conformity plan). \n\n Figure  4.18  illustrates the relative logic for planning tests. \n The logic that guides the de fi nition of the test plan is in practice a methodological \n\nsynthesis of the veri fi cations of the system\u2019s various levels to be as certain as possible \nthat the material produced responds to speci fi c requirements. \n\n Obviously, there is a necessary compromise in choosing tests with the reliability, \n fi nancial, customer, and condition requirements imposed by the market and by the \ncompetition. \n\n Planning tests and the subsequent process of veri fi cation begin from the prelimi-\nnary design phase and extend to the  fi nal acceptance through an articulated interac-\ntion on many levels, from devices to subsystems to the  fi nal system. An interaction \ncan take place in three main phases: the Design Quali fi cation, the Performance \nQuali fi cation, and the Acceptance Quali fi cation. \n\n Design Quali fi cation is established during the initial development of the program \nand consists in verifying the idea of the mission and the evaluation of various options \nof the system for realizing them. \n\n In general, the highest level of testing up to the subsystem and the testing of devel-\nopment regarding essential devices or subsystems of new conception or production \noccur during Design Quali fi cation. The program team can even decide that for these \ndevices or subsystems a simple veri fi cation by numerical analysis rather than a \nphysical test might be adequate. \n\n Sometimes, several Design Quali fi cation physical tests can lead to the material \nbreakdown of the device itself to verify its degree of resistance and change margins \nas a consequence. \n\n The Performance Quali fi cation is performed on representative models of  fl ight and \nthe tests are therefore realized at the highest level of representation for the system, \ntherefore integrating subsystems and devices functionally. Usually in this phase the \npayload of the tests is often greater than the one considered maximum during the \n\n\n\n142\n\nTYPES of TEST\nFUNCTIONAL \n\nTESTS\n\nCONCEPTUAL & \nPERFORMANCE\n\nTEST\nTEST\n\nRequirements and \nSpecifications \nprovide specific Test \ntypologies \nidentification\n\nThe identification of \nTest typologies \nprovide the input for \nTest methodology, \nsuch as test levels \nand test models \nphilosophy\n\nConceptual \nverification\n\nPerformance \nverification and \nqualification\n\nValidation of the\nperformance \n\nAssembly, \nIntegration & Test\n\n  Figure 4.18.    Example of the logic for planning program tests.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\norbital life of the program. For example, tests of electromagnetic radiation or vibra-\ntion are superior to the maximum estimated levels in orbit or during launch. This is \ndone to verify the extreme limits of functioning without, however, damaging the \nglobal performance of the system. \n\n The guiding principle is to look for the maximum level of possible defects to the \nminimum level of the device and subsystem in order to minimize the risk of having \ndefects in  fl ight that will affect the system level. \n\n Proto-Flight Models, i.e., PFMs, are often realized. They are testing models that \nare destined to be  fl own in orbit. In this case from the  fi rst development phases, rigor-\nously analytical quali fi cation tests of the device to the system are adopted. \n\n The Acceptance Quali fi cation is performed on  fl ight models, called Flight Models \nor FMs, and is made up of functional, environmental, and performance tests realized \nat higher levels from those estimated during the life of the program, from onground \ndevelopment to the launch to orbital life. The goal is to test the entire system and to \nensure that it is reliable and without manufacturing defects. \n\n There are different test methods: for numerical or simulation analyses, for tests, \ninspection, similarity, and demonstration following a program review. \n\n The analysis or simulation methods include all the techniques of veri fi cation \nelaborated from mathematical and calculation models that represent the system and \nsubsystems or even devices. \n\n These methods are, however, always complementary and never substitute those of \ndirect testing. They can become alternatives to testing if they are judged economical \nand can supply a high level of reliability or can be done when a physical test is impos-\nsible to perform on ground. \n\n With the development of mathematical models following the increase in capabili-\nties of calculation, the analytical tests are becoming an increasingly used method of \nveri fi cation for the system and subsystem to evaluate the phases of function under \ndifferent operational environments. \n\n Methods of testing for proof are performed for the quali fi cation of a product, of a \nsubsystem or a system, for their acceptance on  fl ight and are distinguished by:\n\n    \u2022 Functional tests , performed in normal environments that are essentially compati-\nbility, interface and function tests for verifying electricity, mechanics, electromag-\nnetic, radioelectrics, etc.  \n\n \n\n\n\n143Methods and Tools of Space Programs Management \n\n   \u2022 Environmental tests  as opposed to functional ones have induced external \nconditions such as vibrations, temperature variations, and different levels of \nradiation. Even these tests are performed at all levels, from the device to the \nsystem, and they are aimed at reproducing the environment in which the system \nwill be found as much as possible during launch and orbit life.    \n\n Test methods for inspection are made up of the visual examination of the different \ncomponents of a system element, from the subsystem to the device and are therefore \nusually used on ground in Quality Control processes. However, tests in orbit for \ninspection are used in verifying the thermal shield of the Space Shuttle or for verifying \nthe physical state of external elements, for example, the solar panels of the \nInternational Space Station ISS. \n\n Test methods for similarity are performed in case a device or subsystem cannot be \nused by a program directly, but can be reused in another program. \n\n This often occurs in commercial programs in which the spacecraft platform is \nalways the same size for economic requirements. \n\n Obviously, even in these cases, the Performance and Acceptance tests must be \nrigorously performed. \n\n Veri fi cation methods following program reviews involve accepting a material \nbased on documentation and tests produced during the review to declare their compli-\nance with the speci fi cations of the material and there is no need to proceed with \nfurther tests. Usually this procedure is performed at the level of device or subsystem \nand essentially concerns an Acceptance Quali fi cation. \n\n Once the different test methods have been examined, it will be necessary to de fi ne \nthe models to which determined levels of veri fi cation are applied. \n\n For example, at the device level, veri fi cation is performed on circuits or bench \nmodels, available in series or integrated with elements developed speci fi cally for the \nprogram. Usually in commercial programs, the quali fi cation of a device is performed \nat the same time as acceptance, even if it can carry risks that in any case are not taken \nin noncommercial programs. \n\n An approach that describes the philosophy of models for tests tends therefore to \nde fi ne at the beginning of a program the nature and number of these models to de fi ne \nthe functional analysis they are to undergo. \n\n This approach is often dictated also by the available  fi nancial budget, by the \nduration of the program and the experience of engineers of the program team. \n\n Figure  4.19  illustrates the main models and subsequent  fi nancial analysis for \nveri fi cation and testing. \n\n The detailed analysis of the combination of various models, from device to system, \nleads to the determination of the testing cycle for quali fi cation and acceptance. \n\n In a space program, the above-de fi ned process is called AIT, Assembly Integration \nand Test, and makes up a very important phase in the life of the program since, as is \nillustrated by the logic model of Figure  4.20 , its development is a function of feed-\nback from initial design phases to the mission itself. \n\n The  fi nal objective of the AIT is to minimize costs and therefore the number of \nmodels, ensuring the rigorous level of technical con fi dence of the  fi nal product. \n\n There are various AIT philosophies. For example, one envisions the development \nof a preliminary model, Development Model, followed by a Quali fi cation Model, and \n\n\n\nCLASSICAL PHYLOSOPHY : EEM + QM + FM\nALTERNATIVE (1): EQM + FM\nALTERNATIVE (2): EQM + PFM\n\nITEMS DEVELOPMENT QUALIFICATION PRODUCTION\n\nEEM: Electrical Engineering\n          Model\n\nQM: Qualification Model\nEQM: Engineering Qualification \nModel (only ground model)\n\nFMi: Flight Model (i = 1, \u2026, n)\n\nSM: Structural Model (in scale)\n\nTM: Thermal Model (in scale)\n\nRM: Radio electrical Model\n       (in scale)\n\nEM: Engineering Model\n\nEquipments\n\nSub-systems\n\nSystem\n\nPFM: Prototype Flight Model (usable in flight)\n\n  Figure 4.19.

The logical  fl ow of this process is illustrated \nschematically in Figure  4.21a\u2013c  applicable to the program phases.  \n\n      Test Tools \n\n Once the AIT Plan is de fi ned, we proceed to examine what are speci fi cally the means, \ntesting instruments, used for the AIT, since knowing them allows us to make up the \ndecisive decision-making processes for realizing the program. \n\n These testing instruments can be classi fi ed into:\n\n   The ground test equipment for the functional tests  \u2022 \n  The test benches for the software  \u2022 \n  The ground test laboratories for the environmental tests    \u2022 \n\n The  ground test equipment  for the functional tests allows us to:\n\n   Verify the interfaces and compatibility of the devices during the integration tests  \u2022 \n  Verify the functioning of the integrated electrical devices and subsystems  \u2022 \n  Determine the margins of function of the devices and subsystems  \u2022 \n  Verify the integrity of the devices and subsystems and their function with the  fl ight \u2022 \nsoftware  \n  Con fi gure devices and subsystems for the launch    \u2022 \n\n Generally, the ground test equipment is divided into:\n\n   Speci fi c Check Out Equipment, SCOE, which are test benches for subsystems, \u2022 \nfeeding, conditioning of the batteries, etc.  \n  Overall Check Out Equipment, OCOE, which are test benches for telemetry/\u2022 \ntelecommand, measurement registers, peripheral calculators, control screens    \n\n These means use different measurement tools and information instruments several \nof which are commercially available and others instead which require speci fi c devel-\nopment for the program. \n\n The program team must therefore have a design vision, but with the knowledge of \nhow to use multi-project con fi gurations to maximize ef fi ciency and reliability. \n\n ESA has de fi ned standards of architecture and informatics languages in the past \nyears to make AIT procedures homogeneous for various satellites developed for \nvarious applications. \n\n  Test benches for software  are always more important given the wide-ranging use \nof software in guidance and control systems of space system. \n\n\n\n146\n\n  Figure 4.21.

(Continued)\n\nMethods and Tools of Space Programs Management \n\n In general, it is a good idea that human resources dedicated at the development of \n fl ight software are not the same ones that carry out veri fi cations and quali fi cation. \n\n The realization of test benches that can simulate the dynamic behavior of \nsubsystems and the system through analogous calculators on board is almost always \nspeci fi c to each program. \n\n The  ground test laboratories  are environmental tests that are usually made up of \nthree classes according to the tests:\n\n   Mechanical tests: laboratories for testing vibration, acoustical testing, shock test-\u2022 \ning, and inertia tests  \n  Thermal tests: laboratories for thermal void and radiation tests  \u2022 \n  Electromagnetic tests: anechoic rooms for testing electrostatic or conduction \u2022 \ndischarges    \n\n These laboratories are facilities which are dimensionally important and function-\nally signi fi cant whose realization and maintenance are justi fi ed only by technical or \neconomic requirements. \n\n In other words, a Prime Contractor of commercial satellites will  fi nd it convenient \nto develop his own facilities, laboratories for environmental testing at his own \nexpense only if he foresees using them for a broad range of satellites whose testing, \npaid by the customers, will cover the cost of investment. \n\n In Europe there are two testing centers that can be used even on a temporary rental \nbasis for this purpose. \n\n\n\n148\n\nREQUIREMENTS\nCompatibility of the \n\nsystem with the \nspecifications\n\nVerification through \ninspection \n\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nNO\n\nYES YES\nJUSTIFICATION\n\nNO\n\nVerification through \nnumerical analysis\n\nVerification \nthrough test\n\nNO\nRISK\n\nNO\n\nTest tools \navailability\n\nAvailable and \ncompatible tools with \n\nspecifications\n\nDevelopment of \ntest tools\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nRISK\n\nNO\n\nYES YES\n\nTEST PLAN \nDEVELOPMENT\n\nYES\n\nAvailability of tools \nfor analysis\n\nDevelopment of \ntools within cost and \n\ntime availability\n\nYES\n\nNO\n\nValidity of available \nnumerical models\n\nIndipendent \nValidation required\n\nYES\nYES\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nYES\n\nANALYSIS \nDEVELOPMENT \n\nPLAN\n\nYES\n\nJUSTIFICATION\nNO\n\n  Figure 4.22.    Example of functional logic for a decision-making path of an AIT Plan.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n There is a large AIT laboratory at ESTEC, ESA\u2019s technological center in Holland \nfor large satellites. \n\n The private company Intespace has a test center at Toulouse which Prime \nContractors use to conduct environmental testing on their satellites. \n\n Then the various Prime Contractors can also have partial testing centers, prefer-\nring to realize several tests in house and others preferring to rent external \nlaboratories. \n\n In the de fi nition of the AIT Plan, therefore, the availability of testing instruments \nis one of the keys to the decision-making process and development of the program. \n\n Figure  4.22  illustrates an example of the possible decision-making path according \nto various criteria, cost, and availability of test laboratories. \n\n Obviously, every decision-making path de fi ned in Phase B of a program must have \nalternative options to follow in Phase C should there be unforeseen circumstances. \n\n Following the decision-making diagram, the  fi rst-level test diagram is de fi ned, as \nshown in Figure  4.23 , when the basic philosophy of test is applied to identify maximum \nnumber and typology of models (SM as Structural Model, EM as Engineering Model, \nTM as Thermal Model, RM as Radiofrequency Model, IM as Integrated Model, QM as \nQuali fi cation Model, PFM as Proto-Flight Model, FM as Flight Model). \n\n \n\n\n\n149\n\nFunctional System Test\n\nMechanic & Acoustic \nQualification Test\n\nThermal Vacuum \nQualification Test \n\nIntegrated System \nFunctional Acceptance Test\n\nMechanic & Acoustic \nAcceptance Test\n\nIntegrated System \nFunctional Test\n\nFinal Verification and \nAcceptance Test\n\nFM\n\nFM\n\nFM\n\nEquipment Thermal \nTest\n\nIntegrated Sub-System\nFunctional Test\n\nSub-System \nThermal \n\nTest \n\nEquipment \nQualification Test\n\nEquipment \nAcceptance Test\n\nEM\n\nEM\n\nFM\n\nEM\n\nQM\n\nQM\n\nQM\nQM\n\nStructural Test\nIn-scale equipment Test on \n\n\u201ctable\u201d\n\nThermal Control Test Radio electrical Test\nTM RM\n\nSM\n\n  Figure 4.23.    Example of main test sequence functional chart.       \n\nMethods and Tools of Space Programs Management \n\n An approach for testing like the one just described is consequently a starting point \nfor looking for a given program to de fi ne a simpli fi ed path that can follow the mission \nspeci fi cations. \n\n It is important to point out that in the operational and logistic reality of a space \nprogram, whose international implications have already been underscored, the \ngeographical logistic criteria of the testing laboratories is quite in fl uential since moving \nresources and test benches for testing must be minimized to avoid increase in costs, \ndelays, or risks due to transportation.  \n\n      The AIT Dimension of a Space Program \n\n The functional and environmental testing must be carried out by specialized resources \nthat can understand the assembly and integration problems and also the overall opera-\ntion of the system that is being undertaken. \n\n \n\n\n\n150 Space Program Management\n\n In a program team two or four human resources in addition to the Program Manager \ncan manage the AIT, while at the supplier level and according to the size of the pro-\ngram the resources dedicated to AIT can increase to a dozen dedicated people and this \nunderscores the importance of this delicate process in the life of a space program. \n\n Moreover, this activity is a signi fi cant part of the budget for a program, with \nrespect to development cost or the material development cost. \n\n Generally, the AIT takes up 20% and 30% of a space program for special cases \nsuch as scienti fi c satellites or habitable systems. \n\n To give an idea, let\u2019s consider a high-capacity commercial telecommunication \nsatellite whose total budget can be about 300 million euro, the AIT can take up to \n20%, that is about 60 million euro, of which the 20% or 30% which are only environ-\nment testing. \n\n Once it is launched into orbit, a space program, due to its nature, can only undergo \nlimited or no modi fi cations to its con fi guration. For this reason the correct operation \nof a system essentially depends on the rigorous application of required models of a \ndetailed onground testing plan.   \n\n    4.5.   Planning and Schedule Management \n\n As we have already mentioned, the life of a space program in its realization phase as \nwell as its in-orbit phase is a multi-year project. \n\n In the  fi rst phase the timetable can last several years depending on the complexity \nof the mission. \n\n In general, an application or scienti fi c program that offers major technological \ninnovations can have a realization phase that can be synthesized in Phase A for about \n6 months, a Phase B of about 9\u201312 months, and a Phase C/D with a minimum \nduration of 3 or 4 years. \n\n It is clear that the length of the timetable of activities is one of the essential objec-\ntives of the program team and since these activities are of a human and industrial \nnature, risks due to delays for unforeseen circumstances or for underestimating the \nefforts required are rather likely possibilities. \n\n In each program there are, as we have already seen for technical margins, delay \nmargins that are physiological at various levels for the various players of a program. \n\n The problem with delay management is that once one is activated, at each phase \nof the program, there can be suddenly a chain of subsequent delays that risk getting \nout of the control of managers with dramatic consequences for the overall program. \n\n In management technique essential tools for the control of program development \nand the analysis of the impact of delays are GANTT diagrams and the PERT method \n(Program Evaluation and Review Technical). \n\n However, it is not the objective of this book to provide the details of these two \ntools that are analyzed in-depth in special books and courses since the conception of \nthese two methods. \n\n However, we would like to cite several general elements that describe the GANTT \nand PERT methods. \n\n The GANTT diagrams are always present in all management systems because of \ntheir clarity that easily provides the reader with the key elements of the activity \ntimetable. \n\n\n\n151Methods and Tools of Space Programs Management \n\n However, such diagrams cannot cover all of the management\u2019s requirements in \nprograms with hundreds of Work Packages. This weakness is because their nature is \nessentially placed on the axis of a mere time calendar and does not express the \nexisting interdependence with various activities. \n\n In truth, the causes of a program\u2019s various problems and delays are actually found \nin these interdependencies. \n\n Therefore, to take into account the criteria of interdependence related to technical \ncomplexity, multiple suppliers, and interface in the customer-program-supplier triad, \nwe use PERT methods. \n\n Planning according to the PERT method occurs in two phases:\n\n   Identi fi cation of activities, i.e., the analysis of the program broken down in Work \u2022 \nPackages with the explanation of the chronological order in which they must be \nundertaken.  \n  The construction of a time network that respects the sequence of activities and takes \u2022 \ninto account the conditions imposed by the program for the management of delays.    \n\n The interdependence of Work Packages is done in nodes which in the PERT \nnetwork are the relative score sheet for the realization of a signi fi cant work achieve-\nment, to which various related Work Packages have contributed. \n\n For example, in realizing a device we can proceed to integration and partial tests \neven with the delay of a component, but it will be identi fi ed with \u201cthe latest date\u201d in which \nthe entire device will undergo a delay in the integration and supply to the program \nshould the component not be available. This delay will affect the subsystem within \nwhich the device will be located and  fi nally the entire program will be delayed. \n\n The PERT network is therefore constructed by theorizing several delay times of \nthe component as well as other delivery times by possible suppliers in order to maxi-\nmize the range of alternatives. \n\n In building the network, the so-called \u201ccritical path\u201d is highlighted (the succession \nof activities which lead to the latest  fi nal delivery date), the one for which the time \nmargin is zero and therefore the most critical one. \n\n There can be more than one critical path and there should be more than one. \nDe fi nitely the determination of the critical path and the margin analysis allow pro-\ngram team to take rapid decisions and to activate the necessary means in time to put \nthe right corrective actions into place. \n\n For example, in the case of the previously mentioned device, as we approach the \ndepletion of the critical path, the program team of a company steps into action to  fi nd \nan alternative solution which could be the purchase of the same component from \nanother program of the company, where the component is not in the critical path. \n\n      Planning Organization \n\n Planning is a method responding to the objective for the management of delays. \n The program is broken down into activities, Work Packages, in compliance with \n\nthe technical organization de fi ned for realizing the mission that is detailed in the \nManagement Plan. \n\n The planning, schematically shown in Figure  4.24 , has generally undergone two \ndistinct moments, which are its elaboration and development during the course of \nachieving planned activities. \n\n\n\n152\n\nMODEL\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nSUB-SYSTEM\n\nWORKING GROUPS\n\nORGANIZATION \nMATRIX PLANNING\n\nINTEGRATED \nPLANNING\n\nPROCESS PLANING\n\n  Figure 4.24.    Example of planning level for a program.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n Planning at the start-up of a program can generally lack several functional \nelements because several technical data may not be available because of feasibility \nor de fi nition studies that have not been completed (for example, by subsuppliers). \n\n The  fi rst stage of planning is therefore global and summary and will have to stress \nkey moments in realization along with the interventions of the leaders directly \ninvolved. \n\n This preliminary planning can therefore facilitate negotiations in progress among \nprogram players to de fi ne a realistic timetable and to de fi ne which activities are \nnecessary to start up immediately because of their critical nature. \n\n At a second stage, a detailed plan is drawn up which gives the logic considered appro-\npriate for realizing the program with conditions and relationships among the players. \n\n Generally, in space programs, Planning is detailed at the subsystem and global \nplanning is done with network methods. \n\n The management of delays therefore requires that time dates accumulated by \nvarious activities are in compliance with a homogenous and common timetable \namong all players. In other words, the timetable of activities must be de fi ned in time \nand work both in days and weeks, in phases for all suppliers with the program team \nand  fi nally with the customer to avoid incongruities from various timetable references. \n\n In space programs, almost always within the industrial unit there are the realities \nof various nationalities and continents and timetable conditions (vacation, holidays, \nleaves and other things) creating a lack of homogeneity, which should be avoided. \n\n Detailed Planning is a \u201cliving\u201d document of a program and the team must update \nit as realizations occur. \n\n Generally, a  fi rst interaction of the PERT method creates a total duration of the \nprogram that is greater than what was foreseen in the contract. In truth, PERT is a \nplanning method for subsequent steps that is based on the estimate of subsequent \nsteps compared with foreseen time frames. \n\n Nevertheless, we work on reducing time, restricting the duration of several \nnoncritical activities, reaching a plurality of possible timetables for activities. \n\n Often several goal dates are \u201cdesire\u201d and are not really urgent. These objectives can \nbe changed at more appropriate times by increasing security margins as the program \ndevelops. \n\n \n\n\n\n153Methods and Tools of Space Programs Management \n\n Moreover, activities on devices or subsystems that are on the critical path can be \nreduced by temporally reallocating them within other technical services instead of \ncentralizing them in only one, or by using other external suppliers. \n\n The disadvantage can be a potential increase in costs; therefore, a combination of \nmeasurements must be carefully evaluated by the program team. \n\n Should these measurements not be suf fi cient, we might think about more drastic \nmeasures such as simplifying or suppressing determined activities, veri fi cation and \ntesting for example, but generally we tend to avoid this process. \n\n Usually, modifying the timetable and putting critical activities parallel are the most \nsatisfactory solutions. \n\n The organizational responsibility is therefore directly referable within the Program \nManager team that delegates a planning manger, the Project Controller, to interface \nwith the customer and suppliers, given the fact that management of delays is carried \nout from the customer towards the program team and from the program team to \nsuppliers. If there are several levels of suppliers, each hierarchical level will carry out \na planning for managing delays. \n\n The Planning document is therefore updated usually on a monthly basis. In any \ncase, in the most critical planning or during the  fi nal phase of the program, the update \ncycle can be weekly.  \n\n      Control Cycle \n\n Once established, the Planning document and the frequency of updating are \nperformed by a control cycle, through the progress reports on activities. \n\n The objective of the control cycle is to update the program PERT, usually each \nmonth, to allow having a detailed idea of the situation and the activities in progress. \n\n PERT stands for  Program Evaluation and Review Technical , and it is a technique \nfor project management developed in 1958 by Booz, Allen & Hamilton, Inc., an \nengineering consulting  fi rm, for the Special Projects of the US Navy of fi ce with the \nobjective of reducing time and costs for designing and building armed nuclear \nsubmarines with Polaris missiles, coordinating several thousand suppliers and sub-\nsuppliers at the same time. \n\n With PERT, project activities are kept under control, using a reticular representa-\ntion that takes into account the interdependence among all the activities needed for \ncompleting the project. \n\n It should be pointed out that the PERT algorithm is not elaborated on a time \nsequence of activities because it does not take into account the availability of \nresources, it considers resources to be in fi nitely available    (Figure  4.25 ). \n\n However, the information from progress reports, at every level, might not include \na detailed analysis of the status of activities, but must contain the notion of impact on \nPlanning to allow the Project Controller to integrate the contribution of various sup-\npliers to the overall PERT. \n\n Obviously, the program team must analyze every progress report to monitor the \nstatus of activities at the level of information contained to know how to evaluate if a \ndetermined report points out or not a potential criticality for the program. \n\n Following the formal acceptance by the program team of an impact modi fi cation \non PERT, the Project Controller updates the GANTT, which thus becomes the new \nreference. \n\n\n\n154\n\nt=3\n\nA\n\nB\nE\n\nD F\n\nC\n\nt=1\n\nt=2\n\nt=3\n\nt=3t=4\n\n10 30\n\n40\n\n20\n\n50\n\n  Figure 4.25.     Example of a PERT diagram for a 7-month program with 5 milestones (from \n10 to 50) and six activities (A, B, C, D, E, and F).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n Since space programs contain hundreds of different activities management \nsoftware has now been developed which allows the constant updating and operation \nof PERTs and GANTTs. \n\n The GANTT diagram is a support tool for project management. It was called this \nin memory of the American engineer who studied social sciences and who created it \nin 1917, Henry Laurence Gantt (1861\u20131919). \n\n The diagram is made starting with a horizontal axis, representing the time arch of the \nproject, subdivided into incremental phases (for example, days, weeks, months), and by \na vertical axis, a representation of the duties or activities that make up the project. \n\n Horizontal bars of variable length represent the sequences, length and time arch of \neach single activity of the project (all the project activities make up the Work \nBreakdown Structure). \n\n These bars can overlap during the same time arch and indicate the possibility of \nseveral activities being carried out  in parallel . As the project progresses, the secondary \nbars, arrows, or colored bars, can be added to the diagram, to indicate the completed \nsubordinate activities or a portion of them completed. A vertical line is used to indi-\ncate the reference date. \n\n A GANTT diagram therefore allows us to graphically demonstrate the timetable of \nan activity, useful for planning, coordinating, and tracing speci fi c activities in a project, \ngiving a clear illustration of the progress of the project represented; on the other hand, \none of the aspects not taken into consideration in this type of diagram is the interde-\npendence of the activities, a feature of the reticular planning, the PERT diagram. \n\n In general a series of attributions can be linked to each activity: duration (or date \nof beginning and end), predecessors, resource, and cost. \n\n The Gantt chart shown in Figure  4.26  illustrates the following desirable features:\n\n   A heading that describes the WBS element, the responsible manager, the date of \u2022 \nthe baseline used, and the date that status was reported  \n  A milestone section in the main body (lines 1 and 2)  \u2022 \n\n \n\n\n\n155\n\nACTIVITY\n1990\n\nTO I & T\n\nTO I & T\n\nTO I & T\n\nF F\n\nFEATURES\n\nREC\nALL SUBASSY\n\nREC REQ.

Spagnulo et al., Space Program Management: Methods and Tools, \nSpace Technology Library 28, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3755-0_5, \n\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n   The risk management of space systems is a process which is expressed through the \ndual determination of \u201cReliability and Security\u201d requirements during the program \ndevelopment phase and their control during the operational phase. \n\n Reliability has its origins in aeronautics history, and it is for this reason, ever since \nits inception, it has been related to security requirements and was transferred to the \nspace sector beginning in the 1950s. \n\n Before the 1940s, the quality aspects of \u201cReliability and Security\u201d methods and \ntools, intuited on the basis of designers\u2019 experience, were more of an art than a \nscienti fi c tool. \n\n In the 1940s, knowledge of the reliability of systems was greatly developed out of \nthe need for designing safe and ef fi cient equipment during war time. \n\n For example, formulae for calculating the reliability in series were developed dur-\ning studies on the German missile V-1. \n\n In the 1950s, in the USA, reliability also became an important  fi eld of study for \nelectronic engineering, whose growing complexity, especially in military armaments, \nand therefore space missiles became the major cause of frequent breakdowns and \nfailures. \n\n In 1952, the US Defense Department founded the Consulting Committee for \nAppraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation, AGREE, whose research demon-\nstrated that electronic equipment was so unreliable and dif fi cult to maintain that if a \ncomponent was worth 1 dollar, the cost to maintain it in operation was 2 dollars a year. \n\n Therefore, their intrinsic project had to contain the foundations of \u201cReliability and \nSecurity.\u201d \n\n The conclusions of the AGREE report were published as American military stan-\ndard, and were then adopted by NASA and high-technology aerospace industries. \n\n In the 1960s, many new tools for Reliability and Security were developed, espe-\ncially for the aeronautics, space, and nuclear industries. \n\n In 1961, Bell Telephone Laboratories introduced the concept of the \u201cfault tree \nanalysis\u201d as a method for evaluating the security of a system designed to control the \nlaunch of the Minuteman missile. \n\n Afterwards, Boeing used the concept again and invented a way of building the \nfault tree as a \u201cmethod of analysis for breakdown and effects modalities\u201d and this \nmethod has been used in aeronautics and space programs regularly since that time. \n\n    Chapter 5   \n\n Risk Management of Space Programs       \n\n\n\n158 Space Program Management\n\n The design phase was no longer part of the  production cycle , but rather \n synthesized every reliability aspect of the entire system, both at the beginning\u2014\nduring the construction/phase phase (quality and security of machines, organization, \nproduct)\u2014as well as during the utilization phase at the end to avoid any type of \ndecline in the quality and therefore the security of aeronautics programs or break-\ndowns in space programs. \n\n In the 1970s, ergonomics studies, which had already been ongoing for 20 years, \nmarked a further turning point in the evaluation of human error, introducing new \naspects of the \u201cReliability and Security\u201d problem, emphasizing the relational concep-\ntion of activities. \n\n Since human and technical errors are usually related, they both became the results \nof the system\u2019s malfunctioning. \n\n The various parts had to be observed in their totality as a single system in which \nnot just the single elements were important, but also their relationships, the \u201cinterrela-\ntions\u201d between man and machine, the so-called MMI \u201cMan\u2013machine Interfaces.\u201d \n\n This new method thus introduced new requirements of \u201cReliability and Security,\u201d \nwhich can be managed by a Program Manager, who can adopt in time the revision \nand design tools of reliability theory, such as:\n\n   Foreseeing the probability that the system will become unreliable and verifying \u2022 \nthe impact of an event on security  \n  Foreseeing the probability of restoring reliability    \u2022 \n\n The  fi rst case involves knowledge which gives the reliability degree of the pro-\ncess; the second case is a decision-making operation which provides preventive \nactions aimed at increasing reliability. \n\n It was therefore understood that to reach adequate levels of \u201cReliability and \nSecurity\u201d in industrial development, it was necessary to manage the risks of the orga-\nnization. This established the basis for the creation of Risk Management, a method \nwhich guaranteed the preventive analysis of risks, their evaluation, and their control \nin the future. \n\n The considered risk refers to a potential loss, linked to an unfavorable event; the \nmanagement aspects and the management staff concern the hypothetical relationship \nbetween risk and possible loss. \n\n The aim of Risk Management is therefore to reduce a possible loss through strate-\ngies and methods which minimize risk. \n\n Risk Management can also be de fi ned as all the processes planned in the beginning \nand aimed at reducing the probability of a loss to the greatest degree possible. \n\n    5.1.   The Concept of Risk \n\n In Risk Management theory, the risk relative to a negative event for a program is \nde fi ned by two parameters:\n\n   The probability of the event occurring  \u2022 \n  The seriousness of the consequences of the event    \u2022 \n\n\n\n159Risk Management of Space Programs\n\n Likewise, risk can also be de fi ned by:\n\n   A parameter belonging to the past that contains all the negative events called \u201cthe \u2022 \ncauses.\u201d  \n  A parameter belonging to the future that contains all the potentially observable \u2022 \nevents in the future called \u201cthe consequences.\u201d    \n\n Irrespective of probability, risk can be classi fi ed into four categories:\n\n   Catastrophic risk, corresponding to consequences such as the loss of human \u2022 \nlives (explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986 or the Shuttle Columbia \nin 2003), or the total destruction of the system (in-orbit failure of a satellite), or \nalso the partial destruction of the surrounding environment (explosion at takeoff \nof the Long March launcher in 1996 with effects on the surrounding geographi-\ncal area)  \n  Critical risk, corresponding to the effects, such as serious but not permanent inju-\u2022 \nries or limited environmental damage  \n  Signi fi cant risk, corresponding to effects such as light injuries or the stoppage of \u2022 \na mission without loss of the system  \n  Minor risk, corresponding to problems in system elements that do not have an \u2022 \neffect on the success of the mission    \n\n      Acceptable Risk \n\n We de fi ne acceptable risk as the risk that is considered tolerable. It is the result of a \ndecision-making process following objective analyses and comparison with other \nsimilar and known risks and de fi nes a range of natural, social, technological, and \n fi nancial effects that can be born by the system. \n\n Obviously, acceptable risk is never de fi ned or approved by the Program Manager, \nbut is the result of a higher level decision. \n\n For example, in the case of space launches from the French base at Kourou, an \nacceptable risk level has been de fi ned for years, which involves the effects related to \ndestruction in  fl ight or malfunction and fall back to Earth of the Ariane launcher dur-\ning the course of a mission. \n\n Obviously, in calculating this acceptable risk, human mortality on ground caused \nby the vehicle\u2019s crash has not been ever taken into consideration as a principle. All \npossible \u201cReliability and Security\u201d parameters have been taken into account. \nHowever, it is not possible to completely rule out a catastrophic event. This is why \nthe major competent authority, the French government, takes the responsibility of \npossible catastrophic events and becomes in some measure the guarantor of de fi nite \nacceptable risk. \n\n Figure  5.1  illustrates an example of how to calculate the value of acceptable risk. \nIt can be seen as a compromise between how much the responsible agency is willing \nto pay at the beginning of the event and at the end of the event, in  fi nancial terms, \nmedia and public image impact, and other things. \n\n It is helpful to also use a criticality graph in Risk Management. \n\n\n\n160\n\n10\u20138 10\u20136 10\u20134 10\u20132\n\nCOST\n\nProbability of an\naccident\n\nACCEPTABLE RISK AREA\n(AS REGARD AN OPTIMAL\n\nECONOMIC FACTOR)\n\nMinimum cost\n\n  Figure 5.1.

Technical \u201cReliability and Security\u201d of Space Systems \n\n A space mission is de fi ned as:\n\n   Successful, if all predetermined objectives, speci fi cations, have been achieved  \u2022 \n  Deteriorated, if a part of the objectives have been reached, whether or not there \u2022 \nhave been Security problems  \n  Failed, if none of the objectives have been reached, whether or not there have been \u2022 \nSecurity problems    \n\n The success of a mission globally integrates with all the objectives of \u201cReliability \nand Security\u201d can be de fi ned as:\n\n   \u201cReliability,\u201d that is, the nominal realization of all the functions which combined \u2022 \ntowards reaching the objectives.

Plan, the  fl ow of activities planned to verify the cycle \nof the project\u2019s life, the production cycle, and the integration cycle of each single \ncomponent of the space system to be realized. \n\n The objective of \u201cProduct Assurance\u201d is therefore the guarantee of Quality con-\ntrol, which starting from customer requirements manages to follow the entire life \ncycle of the product: design, development, manufacture, quali fi cation, integration, \nand acceptance. \n\n The P.A. Plan drawn up by the Prime Contractor and accepted by the customer is \napplied in sequence to the subsuppliers for each product for which they are \nresponsible. \n\n Within the program team, the Quality Assurance Manager will be charged with \nverifying the enactment of an industrial policy for the product\u2019s Quality. \n\n The \u201cProduct Assurance\u201d activities usually begin with Phase B and continue in \nPhases C/D, while speci fi c activities can be enacted in Phase E; usually they are \naffected in accordance with internal quality procedures and speci fi cations of each \nindustrial organization and must be in compliance with ISO 9100 standards. \n\n The P.A. Plan is therefore a binding contract document and constitutes the instru-\nment of the interactive process of risk management.   \n\n    5.3.   Financial \u201cReliability and Security\u201d of Space Systems \n\n As we have already pointed out, Risk Management is de fi ned as all the processes, \nplanned for time, aimed at reducing the probability of a loss, including a  fi nancial \none, to the greatest degree possible. \n\n The realization of a space program requires signi fi cant investments in the feasibil-\nity study up to the construction to launch and use in orbit. \n\n Starting from the moment in which these investments are engaged for the realiza-\ntion of the mission, i.e., they are completely, partially or in any case allocated, they \nare  fi nancially under a set of risks which can have a negative or sometimes positive \nimpact. \n\n These risks can be:\n\n   Personal, meaning the inability, for example, of the organization assigned by man-\u2022 \nagement of the mission to generate pro fi t and cover the investment.  \n  Economic, commercial, or technological, meaning, for example, a  fl uctuation in \u2022 \ndemand for a satellite service because of a decrease in the overall economic activ-\nity of a nation or a continent, or a technological development which brings about \na new discovery which can supply the same service at a lesser cost. In the last case, \nthere is the outstanding story of the commercial programs Iridium and Globalstar \n\n\n\n166 Space Program Management\n\nwhich in the 1990s were developed with the launch in orbit of dozens of satellites \ninto LEO, \u201cLow Earth Orbit\u201d to provide mobile telephone services on a world \nscale. Despite the investment of billions of dollars and excellent technological \nresults, the missions failed their commercial objectives because of the effect of \ndiffusion and less expensive GSM telephone systems.  \n  Variable, which means for example, an accident during the launch phase or the \u2022 \nmalfunction of a device or subsystem during the orbital life cycle with an impact \non the mission.    \n\n Obviously, the  fi rst two types of risk cannot, with the exception of extraordinary \nsituations, be predicted and therefore preventatively managed, while variable-type \nrisks can be predicted. \n\n For example, the failure of a launcher to launch a satellite successfully can be \npredicted as a variable event. \n\n In this case, Risk Management attempts to neutralize the effects of determined \ntypes of variable risks, transferring all or part to compensation, called a premium, \nwhich is conferred to a specialized  fi nancial agent, the insurer. \n\n In synthesis, in a space program, mainly a commercial one but always more fre-\nquently even in government programs,  fi nancial Risk Management is enacted with \ninsurance instruments which translate economic losses, on investments effected, \nwhich result from variable negative events, into economic sums called contracted \npremiums in anticipation, therefore negotiated and stipulated with an economic pro-\ngram investment. \n\n      Insurable Elements per Program Phases and Type of Risk \n\n Insurable elements in a space program are obviously part of the ground segment \n(buildings, facilities, staff) and the space segment (launcher and satellite). \n\n Concerning the ground segment, the insurance techniques to be enacted are those \nrelated to the normal management of more or less complex industrial facilities, while \nthe space segment has special features which are unique to the sector based on the \nimpossibility of modifying and repairing possible signi fi cant damage once the satel-\nlite has been launched. \n\n If we consider as an example the case of a program related to a commercial mis-\nsion for a telecommunication satellite, the elements to be ensured are:\n\n   The satellite, in its various components of pre- and post-launch operations and \u2022 \nduring its exploitation phase  \n  Launch service    \u2022 \n\n Therefore, the  fi nancial risk phases to be managed for the satellite are three: \n\n      Pre-Launch Phase \n This phase begins with the signing of the realization contract and covers integration \nactivities, testing and transportation of the satellite; it also covers activities related to \nthe launch campaign at the chosen base. In this phase Risk Management must foresee \nlosses or damage, which results from external causes (shocks, collisions, introduction \nof external bodies,  fi res, and explosions) of an accidental or human nature.  \n\n\n\n167Risk Management of Space Programs\n\n      Launch Phase \n This phase generally begins when the engines of the launch vehicle start burning propel-\nlant on the ramp and ends when the satellite is physically released into orbit, separating \nfrom the upper stage of the launcher. In this phase, Risk Management must foresee:\n\n   The total loss of the satellite following the destruction of the launcher in  fl ight or \u2022 \nif the launcher does succeed in releasing the satellite into the foreseen orbit.  \n  The partial loss of the satellite following, for example, the incorrect insertion into \u2022 \norbit of the launcher. In this case, the satellite will have to get back into the  fi nal \norbit consuming more internal propellant than expected and therefore will have \nless fuel for correcting orbital drift during its operational life.     \n\n      Exploitation Phase or in Orbit Operational Life \n This phase generally begins at the end of the preceding phase; it therefore includes \nthe operations called LEOP, Low Earth Orbit Operations, for reaching the  fi nal orbit \nin nominal position, and ends when the satellite exhausts its own operational life. \n\n In this phase, Risk Management must foresee:\n\n   The total loss of the satellite following an accidental event, or less, such as the \u2022 \nbreakdown of a critical subsystem.  \n  The partial loss of the satellite following, for example, the malfunction of a device \u2022 \nor subsystem in such a way as to allow reduced supply, in time and quantity, of the \nforeseen service.    \n\n There also are not in these cases stringent or standardized rules, and each insur-\nance policy is more or less negotiated on the basis of the economic availability of the \nprogram and the  fi nancial capacity of the insurer. \n\n For example, the risks related to orbital life can be covered only for a part of the \nsame orbital life, for example, the  fi rst 24 or 36 months, or can cover only partial \ninvalidating loss of the satellite for 50\u201370% (which means only 50% or 70% of the \ntransmitting capability of the satellite if it is incapacitated. \n\n Even the causes of invalidating risks are the subject of careful negotiation, for \nexample, insurance agreements do not always foresee the premiums for partial or \ntotal losses as a result of ascertained defects of design or manufacture, or an inaccu-\nrate commissioning.   \n\n      The Insurance Market of Risks in Space Programs \n\n Given the special nature of the space sector, the insurance market remains fragile and \nextremely volatile in  fi nancial terms. A space program can therefore call upon more \nthan one insurance agency to divide the risks according to the  fi nancial ability of each \nof them. \n\n The market demand is de fi ned as the total sums which in 1 year one or more cus-\ntomers would want to insure simultaneously for the same type of risk. This demand \nis also de fi ned as Maximum Possible Loss, MPL. \n\n For example, concerning launch services, the annual demand of the market is \ngiven from the sum of the MPLs related to all the launch contracts stipulated in the \nworld in that year. \n\n\n\n168\n\n2\n\n1,5\n\n0,5\n\n1998 1999 2000 2001 2002\n\nPremium Claims Ratio P/C\n\n2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\n?0,5\n\n?1,5\n\n?1\n\n?2\n\n0\n\nU\nS\n\n $\n b\n\nill\nio\n\nns\n\n1\n\n  Figure 5.7.

(Air&Cosmos 2209 March \n2010 source).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n Market offer is instead the total sums which all insurers can put on the market in \nview of the MPL de fi ned above. In this case the offer is also de fi ned as the market \ncapacity. \n\n If we observe Figure  5.7  which illustrates the period of 1998\u20132009 of declared \nlosses, the premiums paid and the relationship between premiums on losses, we can \nmake signi fi cant conclusions. \n\n The development of the premiums demonstrates the frequent presence of accidents \nor losses of space systems. In the period considered, about 40% of the premiums were \nattributable to malfunctions of the launchers and about 60% to the malfunction of \nsatellites. \n\n Since the number of satellites insured has remained numerically stable each year, \nabout 20, the decrease in premiums is mainly due to the fact satellites with low tech-\nnological innovation have been ordered with launchers which are highly competitive \namong themselves, and therefore at low cost. \n\n At the end of the 2000s, the market seems to have entered a recovery phase where \nthe number of satellites requested is larger and more costly; therefore, the price of \nlaunchers and insurance premiums has begun to grow again. \n\n An important aspect of the market is the premium rate which depends on the num-\nber of losses obviously but also from the risk linked to technological innovation of \nthe space systems or also the geo-economic association of the operators. At present, \npremium rates have gone from 15% and 20% in 2007 to 11.5% in 2009, according to \nthe various suppliers of satellites or launch services. \n\n Another example is the following case of de fi nition according to the \u201cBurning \nCost\u201d method of the premium rate related to launch service. \n\n The method begins by the observation, on the one hand, of the annual MPL and, \non the other hand, the amount of losses actually paid in that year, always related to \njust the launch service. \n\n If 15 launches were insured on the market at variable amounts, for example, \n3 launches for a value of 80 million dollars each, 7 launches for a value of 60 million \ndollars each, and 5 launches for a value of 90 million dollars each, the resulting MPL \nis 1.11 billion dollars. \n\n \n\n\n\n169\n\n  Figure 5.8.     Main indicators of the space insurance market trend. (Space News 8 March \n2010 source).       \n\nRisk Management of Space Programs\n\n If during the year on 15 insurance launches there were 2 registered losses, one \nrelated to a premium of 60 million dollars and the other 90 million dollars, the pre-\nmium paid by the insurance market would be 150 million dollars. \n\n The total Burning Cost will therefore have been (150/1,110) \u00d7 100 = about 13%.        \n If we assume that the insurer has general expenses equal to 10% of the business \n\nvolume it manages, and that on this business volume its objective is to get a 2.5% \n\n\n\n170 Space Program Management\n\n fi nancial pro fi t, i.e. margin, the new insurance rate to propose for the new year will \nbe increased by a value corresponding to the new volume of business given by the \n1.11 billion dollars less 12.5%. \n\n Applying the preceding formula we will therefore get [150/(1,110\u201312.5%)] \u00d7 100 \n= 15.4%.       as the new rate to apply. \n\n Figure  5.8  represents two different ways to observe the evolution of the insurance \nmarket in the last 10 years. \n\n At the top of the graph is the maximum amount of insurance coverage available \nannually for a single launch of a satellite. The increase in the last years is essentially \ndue to an increase in the reliability of systems. \n\n The bottom of the graph instead illustrates the total number of satellites \ninsured in orbit compared to the total  fi nancial  fl ow of the corresponding insur-\nance coverage. \n\n We can deduce that in the last few years, despite several failures, in general \nsatellites and launchers have performed well to the point that subscribers have \nproduced new insurance capabilities on the market to moderate the premium \nmarket.                \n\n\n\n171M.

Basic Elements for Economic Evaluations \nof Space Programs \n\n When a young person expresses the desire to have a career as an engineer, which type \nof work does he or she have in mind? \n\n Most probably, he or she is attracted by the idea of building complex machines, \nsystems which carry out fascinating operations, the heirs to the machines which were \ncreated during the industrial revolution at the end of the nineteenth century and which \nhave continued to evolve. \n\n To date, man has continued to build complex machines for a variety of operations \nwhich have contributed to revolutionizing our way of living, travelling, and working. \n\n However, in order to realize these systems, there have been two indispensable \nrequirements since the nineteenth century:\n\n    1.    Having, and knowing how to use, the technical competences and necessary materials \nfor designing and realizing \u201cthe machine.\u201d  \n\n    2.    Having the economic resources to support these activities.     \n\n Until a few years ago, the engineer\u2019s basic training was almost exclusively focused \non the  fi rst point, design and realization, but this became a major error with the pas-\nsage of time, since the second requirement is never free from the  fi rst one. \n\n You can have various \u201cdesigns\u201d of a machine, each one requiring very different \neconomic resources in terms of quantity, time, modalities of distribution, and associ-\nated risks to its successful achievement. \n\n This means that cost management is an activity that must be carried out before and \nduring a program and it is not merely limited to control in order not to \u201crun over\u201d the \nde fi ned budget, but it is also a major activity which goes hand in hand with technical \nplanning. \n\n In this chapter we will deal with the conceptual tools to manage problems of an \neconomic nature which greatly in fl uence the planning and management of a program \nin the space sector. \n\n The analyses of the economic effects associated with a particular program are \nimportant in as much as they constitute the essential elements to being able to respond \nto the following main questions: Does the pro fi t/bene fi t obtained with the program \njustify the investment required? What is, among the various technical alternatives put \n\n    Chapter 6   \n\n Cost Management in Space Programs       \n\n\n\n172 Space Program Management\n\ninto place for the program, the best one compared to the speci fi c characteristics of \nthe  fi nancing institution? \n\n In order to take the best accurate decision, the so-called \u201cinformed decision,\u201d \nconcerning whether or not to implement a particular initiative in a speci fi c social-\neconomical context, the analysis of the response to these questions is essential. \n\n This need is, in general, rather evident, but to make it more understandable we can \ncite a few examples of situations in the past in which these economic considerations \nwere not as decisive:\n\n   1950: The USSR enacted the decisive impulse to the human space  fl ight program \u2022 \nto send the  fi rst man into orbit around the Earth in 1961 and to establish Soviet \ndominion over missile technology.  \n  1961: The President of the USA, John F. Kennedy, announced the Apollo program \u2022 \nto the world to have an American land on the moon within a decade, in order to \ndemonstrate its ability to recover the technological gap with the USSR.  \n  The 1970s: the USSR activated programs to increase the power of its military \u2022 \nballistic missiles, to be able to maintain the level of military deterrence with \nrespect to Western armaments.  \n  The beginning of the 2000s: China decided its human space activity plan, to estab-\u2022 \nlish its entrance among the great world powers and high-level capabilities and \ntechnological independence.    \n\n In the above-mentioned cases, it is the existence of an objective of the highest \nstrategic value which makes evaluations of an economic nature secondary. \n\n In particular, in democratic countries, where high public funding is subject to \nevaluations of appropriateness by public opinion, high-cost space programs can be \nundertaken only if: a technical-economic analysis shows a \u201creturn on investment\u201d in \nterms of certain time terms; this is the practice in a \u201cnormal\u201d case, or if the objective \nof the space program has a strategic and political value, which is so important that it \nis shared as a priority by electors; this is the practice in a \u201cspecial\u201d case. \n\n If we had to imagine a future example of this latter type of program, we could \nassume the realization of a space project to destroy or diverge a celestial body which \nis on a collision course with our planet. \n\n In any case, in the space sector, the importance of economic evaluations related to \nthe project is of fundamental importance. \n\n This is related to the fact that the space sector requires public investments of huge \nscope and with long-term returns on investment. \n\n In addition, return on investment is often dif fi cult to quantify in a de fi nite way, \neven if this would be indispensable to be able to deal with the major or minor attrac-\ntiveness compared to alternative uses of public resources. \n\n A common and sensible question, both by citizens and by political decision-\nmakers is, for example:  \u201c\u2026.at this moment for our community is it better to have \nmore hospitals on Earth, or to launch satellites for certain applications?\u201d  \n\n It is wrong to consider that economic evaluations are only useful for supporting \nhigh-level political and strategic decisions because even at the technical design level \nwe can \u201cproduce\u201d a design with \u201cinformed\u201d decisions. \n\n Figures  6.1  and     6.2     show the synthesis of the various utilization levels of \neconomic evaluations.    \n\n\n\n173\n\nLevel Responsibility Criteria for the use of technical-economic analyses\n\nMinimum\n6\n\nLevel: technical \nanalyst (of equipment\nor subset)\n\nThe designer of any type of equipment for space use  \nusually has an established target for its cost as an \ninput. Even though he might not have received it, he \nwill in any case identify various technical options for \nthe required equipment. The suitable analysis of these \noptions (called trade-off analysis) must necessarily \ntake into account economic evaluations. A pro-active \nstance in this sense leads the designer to choose a \ntechnical option through an economic analysis of the \nelements which are disadvantageous in terms of costs, \nand to wonder whether they can be eliminated or \nreduced by using the technical parameters at his \ndisposal.\nThis continuous loop between technical requirements \nand the minimization of their impact on costs is at the \ncore of the Design-To-Cost method. This is now an \nindispensable discipline in the field of commercial-\ntype space activities (i.e., where there is competition).\n\n5 Level: Program \nTechnical \nManager\n\nThe technical manager of a complex program is \nalways bound by the relative cost of the product. His \nspecific responsibility is to \u201cbalance\u201d the \u201cdesign-to-\ncost\u201d effort (see Level 6) on single pieces of \nequipment to channel it into directions which generate \ngreater economic effect and to avoid unnecessary risks \ninstead, where economic benefit would be \ninsignificant. His role is essential in the case a \nsignificant reduction of cost could be introduced on a \ndevice, only on the condition that a certain feature \ncould be added to another device (i.e., where a \nmodification of the requirements of other system \nelements is required). In this case a complex analysis\nof the advantages and disadvantages of both technical\nas well as economic aspects, from the change option\nin question, is necessary to evaluate its attractiveness,\ngenerally at level 4.\n\n  Figure 6.1.    Utilization criteria of the economic data program.       \n\nCost Management in Space Programs\n\n    6.2.   De fi nitions and Criteria \n\n      Recurring and Nonrecurring Costs \n\n The main distinction regarding costs concerns recurring costs, called RC and \nnonrecurring costs called NRC. \n\n The RCs are costs linked to the supply of a single element, and are costs which \nrecur each time the supply of that single element is required. They depend on the size \nof the supply batch and are mainly made up of the following components:\n\n   Material cost  \u2022 \n  Semi fi nished products  \u2022 \n\n \n\n\n\n174\n\n4 Level: \nProgram \nManager\n\nThe Program Manager works with the Technical Manager \nto carry out trade-off analyses of the various available \noptions, in particular regarding the analysis of economic \nimpact. This collaboration is essential even with regards as \nto how to compare correctly the technical risks and \neconomic benefits identified at level 5. The comparison \ndoes not have to be qualitative. Instead he is based on a \nspecific algorithm which translates technical risk and its \nprobability into an equivalent costs (see as follows). In \naddition, by managing contract measures, is it the only one \nthat can highlight particular financial, technical or \noperation conditions which allow a reduction of program \ncosts. In this case, these aspects are the object of further \ntrade-off analyses to be carried out with the Technical \nManager.\n\n3 CEO (Chief \nExecutive \nOfficer) \nIndustrial \nlevel\n\nMany of the typical decisions at the CEO level such as:\n         a) which bids to participate in and at what price\n         b) steering resources to research activities\n         c) which roles to try to cover and how, in national \n         and international markets\nare based on a technical-economic analysis\n\n2 National \n(government) \nlevel\n\nAt the national level the use of economic evaluations is the \nbasis for establishing public funding priorities.\nIn addition, these evaluations are essential for identifying \nwhich of the sectors/activities of national interest can \npresent a return on investment in proportion and in \nreasonable time frame for private industries and \nwhich ones are not. This is aimed at focusing public \nintervention on the latter stage (i.e., where return on \ninvestment is uncertain, or too distant in time).\n\n1 Continent \nlevel (i.e., the \nEU\u2026)\n\nAt the continent level, economic evaluations are the basis \nfor defining funding priorities, to define development lines \nconsidered strategic and to elaborate the multi-year plans of \nimplementation, which are based on the forecasting of the \nresources put at the disposal of member states.\n\n0 World level \n(UN, \nNATO\u2026)\n\nSimilar considerations as those for the continental level \napply here.\n\n  Figure 6.2.    Utilization criteria of the economic data program. (Cont.)       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n  Cost of manufacture and control process, acceptance testing cost  \n  Delivery, transportation, and insurance cost    \n\n The NRC are instead those costs related to all project, development, and \nquali fi cation activities to which the element (or item) must be subject before being \nable to de fi ne it as \u201csuitable\u201d to the particular application in the space mission. \n\n It follows that nonrecurring costs are supported only one time (at the beginning, \nbefore the supply of the items) and are independent from quantity (recurring) of \nsupply for a subsequent request.

Historical cost of MYr vs geographic area.       \n\nCost Management in Space Programs\n\nhigh design complexity and low supply quantities, nonrecurring costs are particularly \nimportant to be able to evaluate globally the degree of \u201cattraction\u201d of an initiative. \n\n In certain contexts, nonrecurring cost is the object of dedicated  fi nancing, released \nfor strategic reasons by the  fi nancing institution (often public). \n\n If this dedicated  fi nancing is not available, the sustainability of the nonrecurring \ncosts is committed to the accumulation of existing margins between the recurring \nprice and the recurring cost, during the commercial phase (see the \u201cBusiness Plan\u201d \nsection which follows).  \n\n      Costs and Prices \n\n The Cost is the amount of resources the producer of an object needs to complete the \nsupply. The Price is the economic value of the object sold. \n\n In general, the price is equal to the cost increased by the pro fi t margin developed \nby the producer of the object. \n\n Where it is not explicitly speci fi ed in the test, we will always use the term cost \n(instead of the more appropriate term price) as if each object were considered from \nthe viewpoint of the  fi nal purchaser.  \n\n      Unit of Measure for Costs \n\n Even in the space sector, there is the problem of how to keep account of the exchange \nrates among the various currencies, of the difference between work cost in various \ngeographical areas, and also of in fl ation phenomena. \n\n A brilliant solution is suggested in Fig.  6.3  where all costs are expressed in \n\u201cMan-Year\u201d MYr. The cost of one man year equals a certain number of dollars in the \nUSA and a certain number of euros in Europe.  \n\n All of this of course changes with time and Fig.  6.3  is an extract of the one intro-\nduced in  [  1  ]  and which is usually used. This resolves the problem of currency, \ngeographical area of origin and, partially, the in fl ation problem.  \n\n      Quali fi cation and Acceptance \n\n Another fundamental distinction to be able to evaluate correctly costs is that between \ntesting (or costs) of acceptance and testing (or costs) of quali fi cation. \n\n \n\n\n\n176 Space Program Management\n\n The activities and testing (costs) of acceptance are those which are generated by \nthe supply of an object on each of the objects to be delivered. \n\n These tests are speci fi cally aimed at verifying the proper execution of the manufac-\nturing process for the object. In general, the loads associated with these tests are equal \nto the maximum loads considered possible during the course of the speci fi c mission. \n\n Simplifying this, we could say that if the object passes these tests, during the \nremaining part of its life (the operational mission) it will have to simply (at the most) \nsupport the same loads again, and practical experience shows that if an object works \nproperly one time it is \u201cprobable\u201d it will work a second time, as long as it is used \nunder the same conditions (loads). \n\n On the other hand, subjecting the element to be delivered (and which will have to \n fl y) to higher loads than the one foreseen in  fl ight, would create excessive risk and \npotential damage, just because of the testing done during the acceptance phase. \n\n The activities, and quali fi cation testing (costs) are instead those that are per-\nformed by the supplier on a single object, identical to the delivery ones and are aimed \nat demonstrating experimentally the existence of a \u201cproject margin\u201d among the maxi-\nmum loads foreseen in  fl ight (the ones used in acceptance) and the item\u2019s capability \nof supporting higher loads, up to the level de fi ned as \u201cquali fi cation.\u201d \n\n From this de fi nition, there is the fact that the object, which has undergone the \nquali fi cation tests, cannot be used for the  fl ight: its \u201csurvival\u201d under the full force of \nthe high quali fi cation levels demonstrates the required project margin, but the object \ncould reach \u201cthe limit of resistance\u201d and therefore not be usable for the  fl ight. \n\n We can think of the Quali fi cation tests as an \u201c exam \u201d of the design worthiness of \nthe object.  \n\n      \u201cCost Breakdown Structure\u201d \n\n In order to estimate the total cost of a complex system there are two main approaches \n(usually both used simultaneously):\n\n   Similarity approach, \u201cTop down\u201d  \n\n  We attempt to start from a total preliminary cost obtained for similarities with \nalready developed systems and whose cost and main features are known. Then cor-\nrective factors are introduced one by one which take into account the  differences in \ncost linked to the differences among the characteristics of the systems: actual and \nsimilar. An alternative, if we do not have a total cost value available for similarity, is \nto start from the highest cost value which we consider allows the commercial use of \nthe system. This total value is then apportioned on a series of values related to the \nparts making up the system (subsystems) in an attempt to go down to levels which \nallow the application of similarity of cost with already developed elements. At the \nend of this process, we evaluate the existence of subsystems where the apportioned \ncosts are too low compared to an estimate based on similarity. If these cases do not \nexist, or if there are compensated by cases in which the apportioned cost is higher \nthan the similarity cost, we can proceed to modify the initial estimate and to follow a \nsecond evaluation loop.  \n\n\n\n177\n\n50000\n\n00000\n\nMYr\n\nDEVELOPMENT EFFORT\n\n10000\n\n5000\n\n1000\n100\n\nRL-10A3\n\nHM.7B\n\nLE-5\n\nVulcain\n\nJ2\n\nViking II\n\nLE-7\n\n500 1000 5000kg\n\nENGINE DRY MASS\n10000\n\nLiquid Propellant\n\nPump-fed Rocket Engines\n\nRZ-2\n\nSSME\n\nF-1\n\n  Figure 6.4.    Typical CER for rocket motors from  [  1  ] .       \n\nCost Management in Space Programs\n\n  Aggregation approach, \u201cDown-Top\u201d  \n  In this case, the complex system is subdivided into a series of minor-level ele-\n\nments (there can even be many levels: 4\u201310) up to the lowest level (i.e., simple), \nwhich can be estimated with reasonable approximation.  \n\n  This tree structure which makes up the complex system is called \u201cCost Breakdown \nStructure\u201d (CBS) and the total cost of the system is equal to the aggregation of costs \nof all elements of the CBS structure.     \n\n      Cost Estimating Relationship \n\n In order to estimate a cost, we often use a mathematical formula, Cost Estimating \nRelationship (CER), which gives the desired cost according to a few macroscopic \nparameters of the system, and which are usually already available during the initial \nphases of a project. \n\n For example, in order to estimate the development and quali fi cation cost of a \nliquid fuel motor with a turbopump, and ignoring for a moment corrective factors, \nthe ratio used in  [  1  ]  is: \n\n Development and Quali fi cation Cost (in man-year cost) = 197.5 *  \u2022 M ? 0.52, where \n M  is the mass, without  fl uids, of the motor system expressed in kilogram. \n\n The CER shown was obtained on the basis of statistical analysis, as illustrated in \nFig.  6.4 .   \n\n \n\n\n\n178 Space Program Management\n\n      The Time Factor in Economic Analysis \n\n It is probably super fl uous to emphasize the importance of the time factor in the \nevaluation of the economic effects linked to the implementation of a project option. \nThis is linked to the two main considerations which follow:\n\n   Money has a price (interest rate).  \n  The price is a function of the reference geographical area, and the reliability charac-\n\nteristics of the requester (which is all a function of time).    \n\n Considering also the two different realization options of a system which have an \nequal value for total cost, they can be more or less convenient according to additional \neconomic characteristics, including:\n\n   Time of investment return  \u2022 \n  Interest rate paid by the person borrowing money  \u2022 \n  Average pro fi t rate of the enterprise (i.e., it is wise to invest in this activity or not \u2022 \nrather than in others?)    \n\n To make the evaluation of these economic effects simpler, various parameters have \nbeen de fi ned which are presented, such as Return On Investment (ROI), Net Present \nValue (NPV) and others, and which are called \u201cmerit factors\u201d of investment.  \n\n      \u201cReturn On Investment\u201d \n\n It is one of the parameters used to judge the attractiveness of an investment. It is \nexpressed as:\n\n   ROI = Operational result (of management; simpli fi ed = sales returns ? total amount of \ncosts) divided by the total amount of costs.    \n\n Comparing the forecast of the ROI with the cost of money we can have a rough \nidea of the program\u2019s attractiveness.  \n\n      Direct and Indirect Costs \n\n By direct cost, we mean a cost which can be attributed in a sure and distinct way to \na single object of cost. Indirect costs, on the other hand, can be attributed to two or \nmore objects of cost. Indirect costs must therefore be allocated to various objects of \ncost which arise assigning a weight of importance that each object has had in gener-\nating this cost; this weight commonly called allocation  coef fi cient  or  distribution \ncoef fi cient . \n\n An example of indirect cost is related to general services such as administration, \nsurveillance, etc., which are supplied, in parallel, on more than one program.  \n\n      Technology Readiness Level \n\n A number on the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale (common to both ESA \nand NASA) is used to indicate quantitatively the state of development of a speci fi c \n\n\n\n179\n\n   Table 6.1.    De fi nition of the technology readiness levels (TRL)   \n\n Level  De fi nition \n\n 1  Basic principles observed and reported \n\n 2  Technology concept and/or application formulated \n\n 3  Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristics proof of concept \n\n 4  Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment \n\n 5  Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment \n\n 6  System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment \n(ground or space) \n\n 7  System prototype demonstration in a space environment \n\n 8  Actual system, completed and \u201cFlight Quali fi ed\u201d through test and demonstration \n(ground or space) \n\n 9  Actual system \u201cFlight Proven\u201d through successful mission operation \n\nCost Management in Space Programs\n\ntechnology beginning with the lowest level (knowledge of only basic principles) until \nthe highest level (technology currently used in  fl ight). \n\n The TRL scale is shown in Table  6.1 .  \n The achievement of levels    up to 3\u20134 implies usually reduced costs; levels 5\u20138 are \n\nfor the most part nonrecurring development costs (>80% of the total). \n Level 9 is already part of the \u201clife\u201d of the technology in the commercial area and \n\nis no longer part of development.  \n\n      Probability and Risk Aspects \n\n The evaluation of probability and risk aspects make the \u201cnoble part\u201d (and a dif fi cult \none) of technical-economic evaluations. \n\n Many key decisions related to a program are those taken at the beginning of the \nprogram (i.e., the absolute  fi rst one is whether or not to do undertake the program); \nthese decisions will be based on several certain data, but others might only be \nestimated. \n\n Several examples, including those that determine the ROI and which are always \nestimated, are the following:\n\n   The number of systems \u201csold\u201d per year (depending on the price)  \u2022 \n  The price of the sale of the system on the market (depending on the future market \u2022 \nsituation)  \n  The cost for realizing a system  \u2022 \n  The cost of credit on the  fi nancial market (depends on the future  fi nancial market)    \u2022 \n\n In the analysis of the attractiveness of a particular option of the system, for each \nof the parameters cited (and for many more which in fl uence the technical-economic \nanalysis) we can de fi ne a probability distribution for the same parameter. \n\n It is therefore possible to carry out a statistical analysis, a \u201cMonte Carlo\u201d type, in \nwhich each of the input parameters is varied according to its own probability curve, \nand to  fi nally elicit the probability distribution of the macroresults (see    Fig.  6.5 , \nCurve a).  \n\n\n\n180\n\nROI\n\nROI\nprob%\n\na\n\nb\n\n  Figure 6.5.    Probabilistic distribution of ROI.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n The dif fi culty and criticality of the choices are evident in Fig.  6.5  which Curve \u201cb\u201d \nis relevant to a different realization option of the same system \u201ca\u201d. \n\n With only data taken into consideration it is not possible to choose between the option \n\u201cb\u201d (with higher max ROI and a broader distribution) and the option \u201ca\u201d (with a lower \nmax ROI but a narrower distribution. \n\n Commercial calculation systems widely available to perform these analyses and \nwith stunning graphics should not give us a false impression of their own power. In \nfact, simulations are essential to allow the analyst to understand very quickly the \nrelationships of in fl uence between the various parameters in play, but by themselves \ndo not give the best solution. \n\n This solution always emerges from the fact that the analyst, dealing with the gath-\nered data, asks himself the \u201c right \u201d questions, such as:\n\n   How can I reduce the probability distributions of the parameters which in fl uence \u2022 \nthe result (chosen merit  fi gure)?  \n  How can I, acting on all the degrees of autonomy of the system under exam, elimi-\u2022 \nnate/reduce the aspects which damage the merit  fi gure chosen?  \n  Is the merit  fi gure chosen actually the only (and absolutely) one which adequately \u2022 \nrepresents the appropriateness = (it is never like this).    \n\n      Comparison of the Cost of a Possible Failure and Cost for Increasing Reliability \n(and Therefore Decreasing the Probability of a Failure) \n Nonrecurring costs, but also recurring ones (see for example the redundancy aspect), \nare very sensitive \u201c to the degree we want a system to be reliable .\u201d \n\n It is quite evident that the cost of a system is always higher as we require a higher \nreliability. \n\n It is also understandable that increasing the reliability of a system, the number of \n fl ight accidents and mission losses will decrease, and with this decrease the cost of \nreutilization and associated insurance will go down. \n\n The \u201cengineering\u201d problem is: when do we need \u201cto stop\u201d looking for always \nincreasing reliability? The process of analysis is represented in Fig.  6.6  where \u201cX\u201d is \nidenti fi ed as the optimal point.  \n\n \n\n\n\n181\n\nC\nO\n\nST\n\nRELIABILITY\n\nTotal cost for reliability \nimprovement\n\nTotal cost associated to the failures\n\nX\n\n  Figure 6.6.

This is on \naccount of added  fi nancing measures put at their disposal to resolve the causes of the failures which \noccurred.  \n\n \n\n\n\n182 Space Program Management\n\n   DOC: Direct Cost Operations = sum cost of ground operations, material cost and \u2022 \npropellant, in  fl ight operations cost, transportation operations and recovery cost, \nrental and insurance cost.  \n  RSC: refurbishment and spare parts cost.  \u2022 \n  IOP: indirect costs of the operations (are in general in  fl ight costs, particularly \u2022 \nsigni fi cant for satellites because of their long-term Mission compared to the very \nbrief time frame of a launcher).  \n  DISPC: is the \u201cclosing\u201d cost of activities and facilities at the end of the system\u2019s \u2022 \ncommercial life.    \n\n Note: For a further detailing of costs which make up OPERC, see  [  1  ] .  \n\n      \u201cLearning Curve\u201d or \u201cLearning Factor\u201d \n\n Experimentally and historically it has been ascertained that the cost of the  fi rst ele-\nment developed is greater than the products (identical to the  fi rst one) realized after-\nwards. This is due to the accumulation of production experience which gradually \nreduces, even in a more contained way, the production costs of the single product. \n\n De fi ning a \u201clearning curve\u201d called a \u201cslope,\u201d  S  = 95%, we mean that by doubling \nthe products realized we obtain a reduction to 95% of the unit cost of production \ninitially equal to a TFU value, whose mathematical formula is as follows:\n\n   L = learning factor = N^B where  \n  N: total number of products (identical) realized  \n  B = 1 ? (ln(100/S)/ln(2)).    \n\n With such parameters we can express the following: \n\nThe cost of production unit made up by  \u2022 N  products =  L *TFU \n Cost of the last product realized in the  \u2022 N  series = ( L ( N ) ?  L ( N  ? 1))*TFU\nAverage cost of the  \u2022 N  product unit = TFU* L / N  \n\n Everything is represented in Fig.  6.7 .   \n\n      Net Present Value \n\n One of the technical-economic trade-offs evaluations is related to comparing the \noptions in which time of generating costs and returns is not identical. \n\n In this case it is normal to utilize \u201ccash- fl ow\u201d\u2014the  fl ow of cash calculated as a \nreturn minus costs, in the time frame which, for a generic project, has the demon-\nstrated development shown in Fig.  6.8 .  \n\n Cash  fl ow emphasizes the positive and negative  fl ows of cash which occur in time. \n We can calculate the \u201ccurrent\u201d value (or for any date) of a  fi nancing foreseen on \n\n\u201cx\u201d (future) date, transporting it to the current date appropriately adapted to take into \naccount the average foreseen development for the remuneration of capital from the \ncurrent time to \u201cx\u201d time. \n\n This current value is de fi ned as the NPV, and can allow a comparison of options \nwith various cash- fl ow developments and a different  fi nal value at the end of the \nprogram.  \n\n\n\n183\n\nLearning curve S = 0.95\n\n0,5000\n\n0,6000\n\n0,7000\n\n0,8000\n\n0,9000\n\n1,0000\n\n1,1000\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250\n\nNumber of units\n\nC\no\n\nst Unit\nL / N\n\n  Figure 6.7.

The Business Plan \n\n The Business Plan is the document which reports the quantitative analysis of the \nattractiveness of a technical-economic activity, which develops over several years. It \nconstitutes the main document which guides the investment decisions on programs. \n\n In its simplest form, it can be reduced to the economic- fi nancial analysis table \npresented in Fig.  6.9 .  \n\n In it are reported, for each of the 5 years assumed for the program, several basic \nparameters for evaluating the investment:\n\n   The number of units (elements/objects) produced and sold  \u2022 \n  The unit sales price  \u2022 \n  The total returns  \u2022 \n  The unit cost for the production of an element  \u2022 \n\n  And therefore the subsequent:  \n\n  Annual pro fi t  \u2022 \n  Cumulative pro fi t since the beginning of the program    \u2022 \n\n\n\n185\n\nYear 1 2 3 4 5 Total\nNumber of units\nproduced and sold (1)\n\n5 10 10 10 20 55\n\nUnitary Price (2) 20 20 20 20 20 N/A\nTotal Revenues (3) \u2018(1)*(2) 100 200 200 200 400 1100\nUnitary cost (4) 18 18 18 18 18 N/A\nTotal cost (5) \u2018(4)*(1) 90 180 180 180 360 990\n\nYearly Profit \u2018(3)-(5) 10 20 20 20 40 110\nCumulated profit 10 30 50 70 110\n\n  Figure 6.9.    Simpli fi ed example of economic- fi nancial analysis.       \n\nCost Management in Space Programs\n\n With the data from the table, in particular for the fact there is a positive pro fi t value \n(and signi fi cant) for the each year of the plan, as well as for total integrated values in \ntime, the investment appears attractive. \n\n The representation of the investment shown in Fig.  6.9  does not, however, take \ninto account numerous factors, several of which are brie fl y described as follows: \n\n  No identity between the number of units produced and sold each year  \n\n The units produced each year could not be all sold during the same year. In this \ncase the relative costs would weigh on the plan while returns would not exist. This \nwould bring about a reduction in the annual pro fi t. \n\n  The existence of previous costs with respect to the manufacture of the  fi rst unit \n(i.e., development and quali fi cation)  \n\n In particular for space programs, there is an extremely relevant cost for the long-\nterm phase of development and quali fi cation of a system and which must be com-\npletely supported before beginning the commercial phase of the system itself. This \ngives us a cost value which is (even much) higher than the one calculated in the \n fi gure. \n\n  The existence of costs associated with the sales process  \n\n In general, the commercialization of a product has costs (partially direct and par-\ntially indirect), which must be supported and which do not appear in the  fi gure. They \nmust be considered, and this further reduces the pro fi t. \n\nThe presence of other indirect business costs: staff, administration\u2026.). \n\n They exist and are indispensable for the operation of the structure which produces \nthe system; not to consider them would overestimate real pro fi t. \n\n  The existence of  fi nancial costs related to  fi nding funds for development and \nquali fi cation  \n\n The need to support the previous costs of sales (in general those related to devel-\nopment and quali fi cation of the system) requires open  fi nancing with third parties. \nThis has a cost in terms of interest which must be included with total costs. This fac-\ntor usually becomes important in the space  fi eld because of the need for ingent  \n fi nancing and with particularly long-term repayment periods. \n\n \n\n\n\n186 Space Program Management\n\n  The existence of taxes  \n\n Taxes exist and should be considered (i.e., subtracted) in the calculation of the net \npro fi t deriving from the activity. \n\n  The existence of the alternative use of funds committed for the program under exam  \n\n Should the pro fi ts, as calculated taking into account all the above considerations, \nbe zero, it would mean that the entire activity foreseen in the period would only be \nable to \u201cpay for itself\u201d and for costs related to the company. This is generally not \nenough because the company could have alternative uses for its technological and \nhuman resources that could lead to pro fi ts greater than 0. This is to say that to \napprove an initiative it must be veri fi ed that there are no more remunerative uses for \nthe company resources (in the indicated period). In general new initiatives should \nhave a pro fi tability greater than the average profitability of the current company \nprograms. \n\n  The existence of the need to remunerate the start-up  fi nancing of the Shareholders\u2019 \ncompany  \n\n Once more, in the case of zero pro fi t of the previous case, there is the problem of \nremuneration of shareholders (or single contributing citizens) who have supplied the \n fi nancing which created the technological, facility and human resources which make \nup the \u201cassets\u201d of the company. These assets (i.e., development of the company\u2019s \nmarket) constitute a mobilization of resources which must generate a pro fi t. This \npro fi t usually has a minimum value which is linked to the one supplied by purely \n fi nancial uses of the mobilized company assets. In other terms, it is reasonable to \nassume that the shareholders expect a pro fi t (usually of medium-high risk) from a \nproposed industrial activity at least equal to the low-cost treasury bonds. \n\n Once we have taken into consideration all of these phenomena, and we have \nupdated the preceding table by introducing all the additional cost items, we suppose \nthat there is a pro fi t value which brings to a return of 17%, which is considered attrac-\ntive compared to alternative uses of the proposed resources, and acceptable from the \nshareholders\u2019 perspective. \n\n At this point there is a further limitation of the economic- fi nancial analysis table \npresented: it does not state \u201cwhat is certain\u201d about the above calculated return. This \nis the critical limitation because it is evident that no worthwhile judgment can be \noffered without a quantitative and technically supported evaluation of the probability \nof obtaining the expected pro fi t. \n\n The approach is to go on to analyze a slightly more complex system, such as the \none shown in Fig.  6.10 .  \n\n We will analyze two problems separately:\n\n    1.     The interdependence of various input blocks of the  fi nancial model      \n\n The most evident is between the market (which supplies the returns as a product of the \nsales price for the number of systems sold) and the unit price: the lower the price is, \nthe higher the number of systems sold, with an impact on the value of returns. \n\n Direct costs will be highly in fl uenced by the number of systems sold, inasmuch as \nthey go down signi fi cantly with the increase of production according to the so-called \n\u201clearning curve\u201d (see the dedicated section in    section 6.2). \n\n\n\n187\n\nUNITARY \nPRICE\n\nMARKET\n\nFINANCIAL MODEL \n(BUSINESS PLAN)\n\nDIRECT \nCOST\n\nINDIRECT \nCOST\n\nRISKS\n\nFIGURE OF MERIT FOR THE  INVESTMENT (ROI, NPV,\u2026)\n\nFINANCIAL \nCOST\n\n  Figure 6.10.

Examples of probabilistic distribution of input data.       \n\nCost Management in Space Programs\n\n Even the risks (of overcosts in production or of an interruption because of an \nin- fl ight failure) depend on  fi nancial burdens which have  fi nanced a more accurate \n(costly) or less accurate development and quali fi cation phase of the system. \n\n We can then  fi nd many other interdependencies going down to a level of greater \ndetail of the model. \n\n This problem is faced when we attempt to model mathematically each single inter-\ndependency and to de fi ne, through the use of an overall global model, the input which \nmaximizes the best merit  fi gure for the case being examined. \n\n It is not super fl uous to underscore that such mathematical relationships have a \nstrong in fl uence on the calculation of merit  fi gures\u2014for this reason they must be \ncritically reviewed basing on the use of historical databases, or other means consid-\nered appropriate. \n\n Finally, the need to relate a tolerance or validity margin to the mathematical models \nused must be taken into account, and must be used in the context of the following point.\n\n    2.     Probability distribution for each input supporting the most probable value      \n\n Each of the  fi nancial model inputs results in a probability distribution, which must be \naccurately evaluated. Generally, we use the following distributions: Gaussian; uni-\nform between a minimum value and a maximum value; and trapezoidal (between \nminimum and maximum), see Fig.  6.11 .  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n188\n\nFigure of Merit X\n0\n\n1\nProbability to exceed the value of X\n\n  Figure 6.12.

Business Plan typical architecture.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n Having these probability inputs, we generate probability values for each merit \n fi gure in output. \n\n The typical form of the probability function in output is shown in Fig.  6.12 .  \n With the probability distribution of merit  fi gures, we can compare various imple-\n\nmentation options of a program, such as giving an overall judgment of merit regard-\ning the option which is considered the most attractive. \n\n Today, with the diffusion of Microsoft Excel-type software, the calculation of \nprobability distribution of the merit  fi gures is rather simple. As an alternative, there \nare commercial programs (@RISK type) which have been specially developed to \ncarry out statistical analyses applied to the analysis of risks. \n\n Alternatively, with a bit of practice with the use of an electronic spreadsheet and \nits macro functions, we can generate an ef fi cient analysis instrument. \n\n The business plan of a program of signi fi cant size has a rather complex structure \nlike the one shown in Fig.  6.13 .  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n189Cost Management in Space Programs\n\n The essential elements for the support of an Economic-Financial Analysis plan, \nwhich makes up the core of the Business Plan, are the following: \n\n      Pro fi t Analysis \n\n It is particularly important in the case of the public customer, where it is essential to \n\u201ctranslate\u201d the implementation of the program in terms of social bene fi t, and to do it \n(a) quantitatively, (b) in understandable terms to Public Administration. It is obvious \nthat the quantitative evaluation of social bene fi ts requires a series of hypotheses. Each \nof these must be listed, explained well, and supported quantitatively in terms of \n\u201ccredibility.\u201d  \n\n      Market Analysis \n\n It is the \u201cmotor\u201d element of economic- fi nancial analysis since it de fi nes the level of \nreturns (sales) without which no plan can support itself. In general, market analysis \nmust de fi ne: a \u201cglobal market\u201d dimension (existing and foreseen in time), a subsec-\ntion de fi ned \u201cpotentially acquirable market\u201d and further subsection which is called \n\u201cprobably acquired market.\u201d Even in this case, it is crucial to list and support each \nof the hypotheses introduced, possibly indicating their particular aspect of conser-\nvatism (or non-conservatism). \n\n An important part of the market analysis is done through the identi fi cation and \ncharacterization of current and foreseeable competitors. In this context, sometimes \nthe so-called SWOT\u2014\u201cStrength, Weaknesses, Opportunity and Threat\u201d\u2014analysis is \nincluded, which de fi nes, for the proposed system, and with respect to the foreseen \ncompetitors:\n\n    1.    Strong points  \n    2.    Weak points  \n    3.    Opportunities to be gathered  \n    4.    Threats (strategic/commercial) from which the company must be defended     \n\n It is very important that all those who work on drawing up the Business Plan have \nthese points clearly in mind. In fact, each section of the Plan must systematically ask \nthe question of how we can increase the strong points, reduce the weak points, take \nthe greatest advantage of identi fi ed opportunities and protect the company from \nexternal threats.  \n\n      Risk Analysis \n\n Usually, a good indication of the Business Plan\u2019s accuracy is provided by examining \nthe analysis of risks. This is because this analysis requires a balance between two \nopposing tendencies:\n\n   Selecting, and de fi ning, \u201ccredible\u201d risks everywhere  \u2022 \n  Minimizing risks taken into account by the analysis    \u2022 \n\n\n\n190\n\nprobabilit\u00e0\n\nEcon.\ndamage\n\nProbability cnsidered as negligible\n\nDamage considered as negligible\n\nArea to be examined\n\n  Figure 6.14.    Typical diagram for evaluation of action priority.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n It is evident that the  fi rst attitude leads to sidetracking the attention to risks which \nare really more critical for the program and therefore diluting the actions for over-\ncoming risks which are intended to be used for contrasting them. \n\n At the same time, it leads to penalizing heavily (inappropriately) the value fore-\nseen for the program\u2019s attractiveness. \n\n An example in the technical area is related to the drawing up of a \u201cmass budget\u201d \nof a system with a large number of the building elements; for each one it is appropri-\nate to select a maximum credible value of the mass (in addition to the one de fi ned \nas foreseen or nominal). However, it is not appropriate to evaluate the mass of the \nsystem as the sum of each of the maximum masses of the single elements; in fact, \nthe probability that such \u201cmaximums\u201d are realized contemporaneously is rather low \n(if the assigned nominal values are \u201cin good faith\u201d!!). \n\n On the other hand, the second attitude (minimize) leads to ignoring effect and \npenalizing risks unjusti fi ably. \n\n Risk analysis must therefore demonstrate equilibrium (that is experience) in con-\nsidering all the risks which are the most signi fi cant in terms of impacts on business \nand the probability of occurrence. \n\n Should direct experience not allow a certain selection of these risks, we can try to \nuse the following approach:\n\n   Consider all input parameters for economic- fi nancial analysis as \u201cat risk.\u201d  \u2022 \n  Evaluate the effect of the shifting of each input parameter of the nominal value, in \u2022 \nterms of impact on one/or more merit  fi gures of the business.  \n  Approximately evaluate the probability of the shifting of the nominal input value \u2022 \ndescribed above.  \n  Construct a priority diagram of invention like the one shown in Fig.  \u2022 6.14 .      \n\n      Development Plan \n\n    The development plan makes up the basis technical document of the Business Plan. \nIt must describe the proposed system and its building parts (including product tree), \nin detail:  \n\n \n\n\n\n191Cost Management in Space Programs\n\n  De fi ne the logic of \u201cmake or buy\u201d of the building elements and their \u201cheritage\u201d \u2022 \n(i.e., level of innovation and, consequently of the technical development risk). In \nparticular, the decision to buy from an external supplier a subsystem (\u201cBuy\u201d) or \ndevelop inside the proposing industrial structure (\u201cMake\u201d) is tricky because it \ninvolves numerous aspects such as: cost of supplier compared to internal costs, \nlevel of strategicness of the sub-supply and therefore the dependence of the \n business on the elements which are out of the control of the Prime Contractor, \nlevel of workload of resources and facilities, technical adequacy, possible syner-\ngies with current or expected internal developments.  \n  De fi ne the logic of development from the start-up of commercialization (including \u2022 \nthe list and technical motivation of the development models, with relative matrix \nof the material, the hardware matrix H/W matrix). The H/W matrix is the list of \neach part making up each of the system models foreseen for its development \nphase.  \n  De fi ne the time of development (including planning in detail of all main activities \u2022 \nof the program and which must point out logical connections, and input\u2013output \namong the various activities).  \n  De fi ne the structure of development costs, usually called CBS.  \u2022 \n  De fi ne the complete and reasoned list of \u201cGround Support Equipment\u201d (GSE), \u2022 \nwhich are the devices/equipment that are indispensable for realizing the proposed \nprogram. Examples of GSE are the following: transport containers, installations \nfor the support or movement of speci fi c pieces of the system, systems of integrated \ntesting measurement to be performed on the complete system or on the building \nparts, systems for charging  fl uids or batteries, etc.  \n  De fi ne risks of technical origin and the countermeasures foreseen in the plan not \u2022 \nto make them critical.  \n  De fi ne the structure of recurring production costs.  \u2022 \n  De fi ne the \u201cWork Breakdown Structure\u201d (WBS). The WBS is the structure which \u2022 \nde fi nes the subdivision of activities to be performed among various participating \norganizations and takes into account the type of work (technical activity, adminis-\ntrative activity, Quality activity, Manufacturing, testing, etc.).  \n  De fi ne all work packages, WPs. The WP is the lower level element used to de fi ne \u2022 \nthe work to be performed and connects to a speci fi c cost. A WP is part of only one \nelement of the WBS (that is, it must be performed by only one organization and \nrefers to a precise type of activity\u2014for example, technical activity). Generally, it \nspeci fi es in three main sections:\n\n   1. Input  \n  2. List of detail activity  \n  3. Output       \n\n The initial information conditions necessary for performing the activity (1), the \nnormally very detailed list of the single sub-activities to be performed (2), and lastly \nthe result product of these activities (3). The result is generally the overall documen-\ntation, hardware, and software which must be singly identi fi ed in terms of required \ncontent as well as delivery date.  \n\n\n\n192 Space Program Management\n\n      The Organization Plan \n\n The organization or management plan must de fi ne in detail the responsible industrial \nstructure of the program\u2019s implementation and the procedures foreseen for its opera-\ntional functioning. \n\n Essential elements of the plan are:\n\n   Structure of the proposed industrial team and related responsibilities.  \u2022 \n  Logic for establishing the industrial team and the speci fi c competences of its \u2022 \n members and the indispensable items, which result for the realization of the \n proposed program.  \n  Organizational structure in detail of the Prime Contractor, and speci fi c structure \u2022 \nde fi ned within it for managing the program activities.  \n  De fi nition of all the interface positions among the participating organizations in \u2022 \nthe program.  \n  Synthetic de fi nition of the main management procedures foreseen for the realiza-\u2022 \ntion of the program (communication, approval and revision, formal meetings, \ncontrol and cost management, invoicing, collecting money, development control, \nmanagement of unforeseen circumstances, contract management, documentation, \narchive, transport and insurance, inventory\u2026.).  \n  De fi nition of management criteria of particular importance in technical frame-\u2022 \nwork, such as software management and management of con fi guration \ncontrol.  \n  De fi nition of key  fi gures of the program, with the presentation of their respective \u2022 \nCVs.  \n  Payment plan and payment conditions. The payment plan is developed by report-\u2022 \ning the value (price) of activities, the objective of the program, with respect to \ntime. Under this plan the customer is asked to \u201cpay\u201d for the activities foreseen as \nthe contractor must provide their  fi nancing. A payment at the beginning of the \nactivities would be too risky and economically burdensome for the customer. Vice \nversa a payment at the end of the foreseen activity would be unsustainable by the \ncontractor in terms of  fi nancial burden.    \n\n  Note on payment conditions:  \n\n  There are various possibilities regarding payment conditions (and new ones often \narise). Several examples are reported as follows: \n\n    (a)     FFP: Firm and Fixed Price\u2014Value in x currency which does not depend on the \ntime payment is made.   \n\n    (b)     Value in x currency de fi ned with reference to a speci fi c year y. The actual payment \nis calculated re-evaluating the x value between the reference date and the current \ndate of the payment. It is obvious that this type of condition is subdivided accord-\ning to the different options regarding the re-evaluation criteria.   \n\n    (c)     Cost Reimbursement (reimbursement of sustained costs): the payment to be made \nis determined on the basis of costs formalized by the Contractor with the addition \nof a pro fi t value x. Even this form can be subdivided according the time re-evalua-\ntion of the costs to be applied.   \n\n\n\n193Cost Management in Space Programs\n\n    (d)     \u201cMixed\u201d systems; \u201ccost reimbursement\u201d type for one part, and FFP for \nanother.   \n\n    (e)     Incentive\u2014penalties: they are systems based on one of the previous ones, but \nwhich introduce a form of incentive or penalty linked to particular characteris-\ntics according to the development of the program.      \n\n  Typical characteristics which are the subject to incentive/penalty are the mass in \norbit for a launcher, or the  fi nal delivery date of a system. \n\n   List of key meetings of the program, such as the Design Review, or others  \u2022 \n  List of the documents to be produced, and the delivery and approval plan  \u2022 \n  List of deliverables, according to the program, whether H/W or S/W     \u2022 \n\n      Quality Plan \n\n It reports the company standards concerning the critical processes for quality level \nguaranteed to the customer. In general, it is appropriate to issue an appendix dedi-\ncated to the program under examination, with the identi fi cation of regulatory \nspeci fi cations of \u201cQuality\u201d which the company intends to implement in case the pro-\ngram is acquired and with the purpose of guaranteeing an even more effective quality \nlevel, and a low level of risk.  \n\n      Resource Availability Plan \n\n Should all the human,  fi nancial, or technical (equipment and facilities) resources not \nbe already available inside the organization for the implementation of a program, it is \nnecessary to present an availability plan of these resources and to evaluate the risks \nassociated to the availability process, with relative consequences. \n\n This plan can be of major importance should there a complex process for its \n fi nancing by third parties (shareholders, consortia, etc.) be required. \n\n Finally, we should mention other speci fi c plans which can be even more important \naccording to the speci fi c content of the proposed program:\n\n   Logistics plan: it foresees and rationalizes all the activities inherent to material or \u2022 \nhuman transport with regard to the program activities.  \n  Insurance plan: identi fi es and motivates all insurances and/or guarantees to be \u2022 \nstipulated, or to take into account, in implementing the program.  \n  Patent and rights plan: identi fi es existing patents which can in fl uence the technical \u2022 \nimplementation of the program.  \n  External authorization plan: identi fi es all those areas of activity, which could \u2022 \nrequire authorization by third parties.  \n  \u201cDecommissioning\u201d plan, or closing activities: provided usually in nuclear or \u2022 \nmilitary space framework and aimed at necessary activities for \u201cdisposing\u201d/mak-\ning secure any material produced during the program and no longer necessary \nonce it has ended. It should be noted that in some cases, such as the nuclear facility \nindustry, costs linked to decommissioning are the crucial results for a proper \nevaluation of the business.     \n\n\n\n194 Space Program Management\n\n      The Executive Summary \n\n It is a brief document which reports the synthesis of all the main conclusions, drawn \nfrom the technical-economic analyses carried out, to evaluate the attractiveness of the \nprogram proposed from a global viewpoint. \n\n It is the documentary \u201cextract\u201d which is delivered to the top management of the \norganization which must decide the  fi nancing of the program (even I have never seen \na top manager take a decision in this sense, without having revised at least the \neconomic- fi nancial analysis in detail).  \n\n      Stability in Time of Results Obtained from the Analyses: \nPhysical Laws vs. Economic Convenience \n\n The technical-economic analysis has a variability pro fi le in time which is particular. \n The technical part is usually based on physical laws which can be considered \n\nstable and on the availability of materials and technologies which are (moderately) \nvariable in time. \n\n It follows that the definition of the system from the viewpoint of its technical and \ncost/time for realization characteristics is stable enough in time. \n\n On the contrary, the part related to the economic characteristics of the various pos-\nsibilities of implementing the program can be highly variable in time faced with \nexternal events. \n\n An organization (an industry or public agency) can suddenly  fi nd itself in condi-\ntions of extremely dif fi cult access to credit (see global  fi nancial crisis of 2008\u20132009) \nand this is an example that would completely modify the relative weight of the merit \n fi gures described above. \n\n This leads to the need to consider the technical-economic analyses as always being \n\u201cinstable\u201d, and the periodic need to reexamine them (during project phases) to identify \npromptly the presence of phenomena which can invalidate results, is highlighted.  \n\n      Schema of Generic Technical-Economic Analysis \n\n A generic technical-economic analysis is based on the following passages of general \nnature:\n\n   A speci fi c technical con fi guration of the system and its operations is theorized.  \u2022 \n  A time plan for development and quali fi cation of the system and the duration of \u2022 \nthe commercial phase (and dismantling, if applicable) are defined.  \n  All LCC linked to the con fi guration and commercialization are evaluated.  \u2022 \n  Financial costs are added to the need for acquiring the necessary resources in \u2022 \ntime.  \n  Costs for unforeseen circumstances (connected to the risk level associated with the \u2022 \ncon fi guration under exam) are added.  \n  A corresponding sales plan is conceived and a particular price (it is calculated on \u2022 \na series of sub-cases derived from the so-called marketing model).  \n  Returns in time after sales are calculated and the cash- fl ow development is derived.  \u2022 \n  Merit  fi gures on the considered option are calculated.  \u2022 \n\n\n\n195\n\nNPV0\n\n0.5\n\n1 B\n\nA\n\nNPV p = 0.5\n\nProbability to\nexceed NPV\n\n  Figure 6.15.    Net present value analysis.       \n\nCost Management in Space Programs\n\n  A statistical analysis of probability to evaluate the standard deviation is performed \u2022 \non the merit  fi gures of greatest interest\u2014see Fig. 6.1.5    whose merit is related to \nthe sole value of the NPV.  \n  We return to the  fi rst step and analyze another option.    \u2022 \n\n In the end we perform a trade-off analysis of the various options. \n Note: \n Figure  6.15  refers to two different technical-economic options for the realization \n\nof a system for which the most important criterion for the appropriate trade-off has \nbeen decided to be the maximization of Net Present Value.  \n\n It is important to note that option A is a major risk, and B is a minor risk (it might \nnot in any case \u201cautomatically\u201d be necessarily the best one). \n\n It is important to observe that if we limited ourselves to calculating only the \u201cmost \nprobable values\u201d of the NPV of options A and B, these would be identical, thus  not allowing \nthe evaluation of risk aspects  which highly differentiate the two examined options.   \n\n    6.4.   Example of Cost Analysis for a Space Launcher \n\n One of the most important steps in generic technical-economic analysis presented \nabove is made up of the calculation of costs, LCC, of a system. \n\n The following paragraphs present an example case related to a launch system to \nbe utilized for substituting satellites in the Galileo constellation for satellite \nnavigation. \n\n The method used has been de fi ned in  [  1  ]  and is based on the use of CER, and \nspeci fi c corrective factors of the application being examined. \n\n Description of the program:\n\n   Consider two launches per year from the European base of Kourou for 20 years, with \nthe objective of injecting in its  fi nal circular orbit about 23,000 km altitude and 56\u00b0 \ninclination, 1 satellite at a time (1,000 kg weight at launch).    \n\n \n\n\n\n196\n\n   Table 6.2.

Evaluation of the total development cost based on Table 2-01 of  [  1  ] .       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n In order to verify the order of size of the costs of development and quali fi cation \nobtained, we can use Table  6.3  which gives us the macroscopic correlation between \nweight at launch of the launcher (\u201cGLOW\u201d equal to 398 tons), and its development \nand quali fi cation cost. This is demonstrated in Fig.  6.23 .  \n\n The order of size is con fi rmed; the highest value supplied by the table is justi fi ed \nby the fact that the theoretical launcher is made up of element which are in part exist-\ning and by only the third stage which has to be developed. \n\n Step 4: calculation of the CER for production activity. \n The calculation of the CER for production activities is presented in Fig.  6.24 , and \n\nTables  6.8 ,  6.9 , and  6.10 .     \n\n Step 5: calculation and application of corrective factors to the production CERs. \n The calculation and application of corrective factors to the production CERs is \n\npresented in Figs.  6.25  and  6.26 .   \n Factor f4 keeps into account that as the identical units are produced, their unit \n\nproduction cost tends to decrease because of the accumulation of experience (see the \npart on the de fi nition of the \u201clearning curve\u201d in    section 6.2). \n\n Therefore, to realize N units, the cost will not be N*CER, but rather N*CER*f4 \n(f4 < 1). The calculation of factor f4 starts from the de fi nition of learning factor \u201c p \u201d: \nlearning factor  p  (T.P. Wright 1936) equal to 0.8 (or 80%) means that by doubling the \nunits produced, the unit cost will be reduced and assumes a value of 0.8 (80%) of the \ninitial one. \n\n A historical analysis of the values of  p  applicable to the space sector (and sug-\ngested by  [  1  ] ) leads us to choosing values  p  between 0.8 and 1.0. \n\n Clearly, factor f4 multiplied by the total number of elements produced, should not \nbe considered the reduction factor applicable to the last element produced, but rather \nthe average cumulative reduction factor should be calculated on the total for produc-\ntion (i.e., in the case of two elements produced with learning factor 0.8: the  fi rst one \ncosts 1, the second one costs 0.8, but the average of the two is 0.9). In the case of the \nexample shown, a value of  p  = 0 (90%) has been assumed. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSECTION 3: TOTAL PRODUCTION \nCOST\nSECTION 3.1: TFU CER DEFINITION\nSection 3.1.1: Booster\n\nNET Booster mass (Kg)= 2980\nBooster TFU (MYr)= 239,2 Interp tab 3-11\nfrom: FES = 2.42*n*M^0.395= 228,1344\n\ni mi TFUi mi+1 TFUi+1\n12 2000 50 3000 60\n\nSection 3.1.2: First stage Engine\nNET SRM mass (Kg)= 11190\nSRM TFU (MYr)= 103,57 Interp tab 3-11\nfrom: FES = 2.42*n*M^0.395= 96,18409\n\ni mi TFUi mi+1 TFUi+1\n16 10000 100 20000 130\n\nSection 3.1.2 bis: Second stage Engine:\nNET SRM mass (Kg)= 11190\nSRM TFU (MYr)= 103,57\n\nSection 3.1.3: 3rd stage engine\nEngine mass (Kg)= 200\nEngine TFU (MYr)= 55 Interp tab 3-13\nfrom: FELC = 5.16*M^0.45 55,99035\n\ni mi TFUi mi+1 TFUi+1\n8 200 55 300 65\n\nSection 3.1.4: 3rd stage\nDry M w/o Eng (Kg)= 2831,63\nStage level TFU (MYr)= 212,4234 Interp tab 3-17\nfrom: FVP = 1.3*M^0.65= 227,912\n\ni mi TFUi mi+1 TFUi+1\n11 2000 175 3000 220\n\n  Figure 6.24.

Example of Cost Analysis for a Satellite \n\n One of the most well-known methods for de fi ning development and quali fi cation \ncosts of a satellite is the one presented in  [  2  ] , which is also based on the method of \nCER, with appropriate corrective factors. \n\n Following is an example of the calculation developed for phase A of a prototype \nsatellite. \n\n Costs have been reported in kilo$ relative to the year 2000, as in  [  2  ] . \n\n      Problem to Be Resolved \n\n Evaluate the possibility, or not, of carrying out the development and quali fi cation of \na satellite system within a total  fi xed budget of 20 million $, and calculation of the \nbudget related to the various areas (subsystems and main project activities).  \n\n      Calculation Logic \n\n    Step (a): On the basis of the historical distribution of the data of costs for satellite \ndevelopment, the total available is apportioned on various cost items.  \n\n  Step (b): corrective factors are introduced to take into account the project character-\nistics and the industrial team which must develop them.  \n\n  Step (c): we analyze the technical-economic feasibility of each cost item within the \nbudget assigned (through the use of speci fi c CERs).  \n\n \n\n\n\n211\n\n   Table 6.11.

Criteria for Reducing Costs \n\n There now exists a consistent margin for reducing costs in the space framework; in \nparticular concerning development and quali fi cation costs. \n\n Many program managers have performed analyses aimed at selecting the neces-\nsary actions to perform cost reduction. \n\n The most important of all of them, however, is to diffuse, from the lowest operational \nlevel, a real \u201csensitivity\u201d to the search for approaches and actions which can reduce \ncosts. Especially in Europe, at least 90% of technicians operating in the sector do not \n really  have the objective of reducing costs through their work and their creativity. \n\n This feeling is veri fi able if we ask many of these technicians what they think is \npossible (obviously with secondary risks) to reduce costs on the system they are \nworking on. The answer is usually not immediate, but after reasoning one or more \nhypotheses are always pointed out. \n\n These hypotheses are not usually (by the involved person) \u201cpublicized\u201d or dis-\ncussed or expressed to superiors. \n\n What is the reason for this attitude? The answer is not speci fi c, but denotes, in \ngeneral, surprise by the person who has no idea it can be important, or at least \nsigni fi cant. \n\n The following are reported on next pages:\n\n    (a)    Considerations on the origin of potentially reducible costs.  \n    (b)    Guidelines for realizing a development program of a reduced cost launcher.  \n    (c)    What has been applied as reference to \u201cLockheed Martin\u201d to obtain reduced \n\ndevelopment costs and,  fi nally.  \n    (d)    The experiences, lessons learned, by Italian industry in the framework of devel-\n\noping the European launcher Vega and the preliminary results obtained.     \n\n (a) Reference  [  3  ]  refers, at    section 6.2, the main factors which have generated extra \ncosts which are not technically justi fi able:\n\n   1.    Forms of management duplication between customer and Prime Contractor \nwith subsequent over sizing of the industrial team to have all the proper inter-\nfaces with the customer  \n\n   2.    Management procedures which are not sensitive to the cost aspect, in \nparticular: \n\n Over speci fi cation (over-abundant requirements and partially useless) \n Excessive progress reports (even one per week!) \n Excessive formal meetings\u2014Design Reviews \n Excessive documentation \n Excessive concern for traceability (in development and quali fi cation phase) \n\n\n\n217Cost Management in Space Programs\n\n Excessive bureaucracy in the management of contract changes  \n\n   3.    Aversion to risk acceptance (systematic use of veri fi cation only through tests)  \n   4.    Excessive duration of the program, caused especially by: \n\n Long acquisition phase of the program \u2022 \n Frequency of stops/slowdowns and resumption of program activities \u2022 \n Duration of approval procedures  \u2022 \n\n   5.    Tendency to expect the optimality of any technical solution with the subse-\nquent rare use of existing material  \n\n   6.    Strong subdivision of activities over several sequential contracts instead of \nonly one of greater size.     \n\n (b) Reference  [  4  ]  instead reports in Table 1\u20133 the following methods for realizing a \nsigni fi cant reduction in costs:\n\n   Accurate critical review of requirements, see (a2)  \n  Concurrent Engineering  \n  \u201cDesign to Cost\u201d  \n  Reduction of development time, see (a4)  \n  Reduction of the impact of possible negative circumstances, see (a3)  \n  Use of microprocessors  \n  Introduce relevant margins to reduce testing, see (a3)  \n  Use existing material also not of space origin, see (a5)  \n  Use highly autonomous systems  \n  Use components and standard interfaces, see (a5)    \n\n (c) The basic criteria de fi ned instead by Lockheed Martin [\u201cskunk works rules,\u201d see \nnote (1)] are as follows:\n\n   Strong management of the program with complete authority  \n  Reduced management team by the Customer, and with full authority reduced \n\nnumber of participating contractors to the team (but experts)  \n  Release system of designs, streamlined  \n  Reduced documentation  \n  Systematic review meetings on costs  \n  Prime contractor directly responsible of his/her subcontractors \nElimination of duplication in inspections  \n  Final control of the customer in  fl ight mission \nTime stability of requirements  \n  Regular and adequate release of funding  \n  Mutual respect between the Prime Contractor and the customer  \n  Reduction of outside environmental disturbances as much as possible  \n  Economic bonuses system in case of excellence    \n\n  Note (1): The de fi nition from the web is the following:  \n\n  Skunk Works is an of fi cial alias for   Lockheed Martin\u2019s   Advanced Development \nPrograms (ADP), formerly called Lockheed Advanced Development Projects.

This was well represented in \n2000 on the cover page of the formal offer for the development and qualification of \nthe launcher, as shown in Fig.  6.34 .  \n\n The management plan de fi ned at that time foresaw the implementation of many \nrecommendations developed in the US framework already cited, and adapted to its \nuse in European framework. \n\n \n\n\n\n219\n\n   Table 6.14.

Forms of Financing for Space Programs \n\n Forms of  fi nancing for space projects can be essentially subdivided into three \ncategories:\n\n   Public  fi nancing, where the  fi nancial coverage of the project is directly or indi-\u2022 \nrectly guaranteed by the government\u2019s budget, normally on a multiyear basis.  \n  Private  fi nancing, the project is  fi nanced through the contribution of private capital \u2022 \nboth on the basis of corporate  fi nancing and through the use of  fi nancial project \ntools (\u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d type).  \n  Public\u2013private co- fi nancing;  fi nancial coverage of the project is guaranteed through \u2022 \npublic and private  fi nancing with a de fi nite mix on the basis of the nature of the \ninitiative which is the aim of the investment and the economic- fi nancial return.    \n\n Public funding includes three types of actions:\n\n   Those referred to as capital account expenses, or public investments to be realized \u2022 \nin several successive parts by single Ministries.  \n  Those regarding international projects, or developed by public agencies with inter-\u2022 \nnational rights such as the European Space Agency ESA, the European Union, the \nEuropean Southern Observatory (ESO), and other similar institutes.  \n  The one relative to national agencies, such as the Italian Space Agency, the French \u2022 \nCNES, the German DLR, the American NASA, etc.    \n\n The  fi rst type includes capital account expenses carried out by Ministries. These \nexpenses require a law of authorization, their registration in the budget, and relative \n fi nancial coverage which guarantees the previous evaluation of the impact on \nexpenses foreseen on public funds. \n\n    Chapter 7   \n\n Financial Management of Space Programs       \n\n\n\n222 Space Program Management\n\n On the other hand, concerning the allocation of funds, this is done in the execution \nof the forecast budget through procedural phases which represent the commitment to \nthe funding, or the earmarking in the budget of the amount of money needed for \ndetermined expenses which establish the binding condition of the amount\u2019s destina-\ntion, liquidation (determination of the exact amount of the expense or debt with the \ncontextual selection of the exact creditor), order (issue of expense account for pay-\nment of an amount of money to creditors), and payment. \n\n The second type concerns the funds put at the disposal of agencies or international \norganizations operating exclusively in the space or astronomy sector (ESO is active \nin particular in this sector, as well as ESA which funds scienti fi c and application \nprojects) or with broader scope (European Union), which includes in any case the \ndevelopment of technologically advanced programs in the space sector. \n\n The programs developed by ESA, in particular, can be \u201cmandatory\u201d or \u201coptional.\u201d \nThe mandatory programs are performed in the framework of the general budget and \nthe scienti fi c program budget and include the basic activities of the agency (examina-\ntion of future projects, technological research, common technical investments, infor-\nmation systems, educational programs). All of the Member States contribute \n fi nancially to these programs in proportion to their national GDP. \n\n The other programs, termed optional, involve only several Member States which \nare free to establish their level of  fi nancial participation to such programs on the basis \nof subjective evaluations. Both mandatory programs and optional programs are \ndeveloped through the assignment of contracts to the industries of various ESA \nMember States which follow the logic of geographical return. For this reason, each \ncountry receives compensation for the investments effected for contracts for national \nindustries of equivalent value. \n\n The rule of geographical return which characterizes ESA, does not apply instead \nin the framework of the European Union, which  fi nances space mainly through \nFramework Programs for Scienti fi c and Technological Research of the EU (R&S and \ntechnological innovation) and the network of trans-European transport (Trans-\nEuropeanTransport Network-TEN-T). \n\n It is important to underscore that the European Union and the European Space \nAgency, with the aim of optimizing the use of  fi nancial resources at the European \nlevel, unite in developing projects of common interest co- fi nancing major programs \nsuch as, for example, the European program for satellite navigation or GMES, Global \nMonitoring for Environment and Security. \n\n The third form of public funding comes from national agencies which  fi nance the \ndevelopment of space programs on the basis of multiyear plans drawn up according \nto research and development objectives, including industrial ones, which the govern-\nments of each country aim to follow.  \n\n    7.2.   Private Financing \n\n Commercial space projects, which can guarantee economic returns to their promot-\ners, can be  fi nanced either in the framework of typical economic activities of the \nenterprise which develops them (corporate a) or by separating the economic initiative \nto be realized by normal business activities (\u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d-type). \n\n\n\n223Financial Management of Space Programs\n\n In the  fi rst case, the project to be realized is part of the normal business operations \nand the decision regarding its  fi nancing is taken on the basis of its impact on the \ngeneral economic- fi nancial equilibrium of the business which realizes the investment. \nIn the second case, the investment decision has as its objective the economic- fi nancial \nequilibrium evaluation of one speci fi c business project, legally and economically \nindependent from the characteristic management of the businesses which develop it. \n\n In this chapter, we will deal with the methods of economic- fi nancial analysis and \nevaluation of investment projects, speci fi cally highlighting the distinct characteristics \nof satellite programs. \n\n Since these projects normally involve the participation of individuals and compa-\nnies with various competences (manufacturers, satellite operators, launch services \ncompanies,  fi nancial institutions, etc.) and are  fi nanced through the tools of \u201cproject \n fi nancing,\u201d in this section we will focus mainly on those tools, emphasizing the main \ntypes of \u201cproject  fi nancing,\u201d the types of companies which participate in them in vari-\nous ways, the contractual and legal structures of these operations and, in particular, \nthe guarantee mechanisms (the so-called \u201csecurity packages\u201d) normally required by \n fi nancial institutions. \n\n The chapter will conclude then with an analysis of several space projects in which \n\u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d tools have been used.  \n\n    7.3.   \u201cProject Financing\u201d for Space Programs \n\n Iridium, Globalstar, ICO, Thuraya, Sea Launch are only several of the various exam-\nples of commercial initiatives in which \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d tools have been applied to \nspace programs. \n\n Beginning in the 1980s, with the broad development of a commercial market for \ntelecommunications, observation and launch services, \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d found \nwidespread use in all satellite projects, and space in general, which could generate \nmajor economic returns for the industrial and  fi nancial sponsors involved. \n\n Since \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d is a  fi nancing operation based on the ability of the com-\npany  fi nanced to reimburse  fi nancing obtained in the form of risk and debt capital, \nthis  fi nancial instrument was applied exclusively to space projects of a commercial or \nprimarily commercial nature. \n\n      De fi nition of \u201cProject Financing\u201d \n\n \u201cProject  fi nancing\u201d can be de fi ned as a  fi nancial operation in which:\n\n   The economic initiative is realized by its promoters through the establishment of \u2022 \na project company, called the \u201cSpecial Purpose Vehicle\u201d or scope company which \nallows the economic and legal separation of an initiative, the \u201cRing Fence,\u201d the \nobject of  fi nancing by the general activities of the companies which participate in \nthis initiative as sponsors.  \n  The initiative is evaluated by  fi nancial institutions, for example, banks and share-\u2022 \nholders, mainly on its ability to generate returns and cash  fl ow.  \n\n\n\n224 Space Program Management\n\n  The cash  fl ows connected to the management of the initiative represent the main \u2022 \nsource for the debt service and for the remuneration of the risk capital.  \n  The main guarantees in favor of the banks, or  fi nancial organizations, are mainly \u2022 \nof a contractual nature.    \n\n \u201cProject  fi nancing,\u201d although presenting similar characteristics to a normal busi-\nness  fi nancing, i.e., corporate  fi nancing, distinguishes itself from it inasmuch as the \n fi nancing decision is based on the economic- fi nancial evaluation of a single entrepre-\nneurial decision, separated from the general activities of the sponsors (participating \nparties) through the establishment of a special purpose joint venture, the previously \nmentioned SVP, or a project company whose business purpose is to realize a speci fi c \nproject of investment. Therefore, we can derive that the investment decision does not \ndepend on the economic- fi nancial equilibrium of the sponsors but from the \npro fi tability pro fi le of the project. \n\n Although it is undeniable that the evaluation of the merit of credit and therefore of \nthe  fi nancial strength of businesses which participate as shareholders to a \u201cproject \n fi nancing\u201d project can positively in fl uence the availability of banks towards  fi nancing \nan initiative, \u201cproject  fi nancing,\u201d as a  fi nancial tool, basically disregards this evalua-\ntion and therefore analyzes the single  fi nancing operation on the basis of the eco-\nnomic returns it expects. \n\n With this view, however, the  fi nancing decision of banks depends in great measure \non the experience and managing ability of the sponsors with respect to their  fi nancial \ncapacity, inasmuch as it is the sponsors\u2019 capacity, and not their  fi nancial standing, \nwhich is the main guarantee for the success of the initiative that is being  fi nanced. \n\n \u201cRing fencing,\u201d then, understood as the economic and legal separation of the ini-\ntiative through the establishment of an ad hoc company whose business purpose is the \nrealization of a speci fi c initiative, represents the  fi rst element which characterizes a \n\u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d operation. \n\n The project company, normally in the form of companies with share capital, is \nestablished by sponsors in the initial phase of the initiative and generally has limited \ncapitalization which increases in time according to the degree of development of the \ninitiative and therefore the  fi nancial needs of the company which realizes it. The \n fi nancial plan of the project company is de fi ned according to the business plan which \nis de fi ned by the founding partners and, subsequently, is arranged with the banks. \n\n The founding partners are represented by the shareholders, for the development of \nhis/her own  core business , to realize the initiative and for this reason are de fi ned as \ncore sponsors, or industrial or strategic partners. Their participation to the  fi nancing \nof the initiative is evaluated not only on the basis of the pro fi tability outlook of the \nproject company, but also according to the industrial returns which can be derived \nfrom the realization of the project itself, both during the investment phase (construc-\ntion of the work or infrastructure) and during the management phase (commercial use \nof the infrastructure or work  fi nanced). \n\n In the space sector speci fi cally, the industrial or strategic partners can be repre-\nsented by manufacturing companies interested in building, through a contract to \nbe signed with the SPV, the project\u2019s infrastructure (space segment and ground \nsegment), by telecommunications satellite operators interested in supplying ser-\nvices of various nature through the infrastructure commissioned by the SPV, by \n\n\n\n225Financial Management of Space Programs\n\ntelecommunication companies in general or by companies producing stations or \non-ground equipment. \n\n As an example, the body of sponsors of the Thuraya 1  project, represented by a \n\u201cturn-key\u201d system (i.e., realized with a contract including construction, launch and \nputting into operation) of three  fi xed and mobile telecommunication satellites, was \nimplemented through a dedicated company established in the United Arab Emirates \nin January 1997, and which had as shareholders Boeing Satellite Systems, the \nETILASAT (Emirates Telecommunications Corporation\u2014UAE) and various other \ntelecommunication companies located in countries under coverage by the system, an \ninternational organization (Arabsat), and a series of  fi nancial investors such as Abu \nDhabi Investment Company (ADIC), the Dubai Investments PJSC, etc. The Thuraya \ncompany was initially capitalized with about 25 M$, increased after about 1 year to \nabout 500 M$ following the subscription of new shares by new partners. \n\n Another example, in the launcher sector, is represented by the Sea Launch project \nrelated to the supply of launch services for geostationary satellites through a launcher \nlifting-off from a platform located in the Paci fi c Ocean. This initiative was realized \nthrough an international \u201cJoint Venture\u201d formed in 1995 between Boeing Commercial \nSpace which had the responsibility for operational management and commercialization \nof services, the Russian aerospace company RSC Energia, the Norwegian Kvaerner, \nnow Aker Solutions, responsible for building the Odissey platform and the Ukrainian \nYuzhnoye/Yuzhmash, supplier of the  fi rst two stages of the ex-military Zenith 3SL \nrocket. The investment in share capital of the industrial partners was increased in time \nthrough the addition of other  fi nancial commitments by several of them (subordinated \nloan and guarantees in favor of the banks), as well as major  fi nancing by the interna-\ntional bank system in part guaranteed by direct commitments by the sponsors. \n\n As indicated, in the case of industrial initiatives with a good  fi nancial return out-\nlook, even  fi nancial sponsors who do not have an industrial interest in the initiative \nbut who participate with a view of pure  fi nancial return can participate to the \n fi nancing. These legal entities, normally represented by investment companies or \nventure capital, usually acquire a minor participation in the project company in its \ninitial development phase and then subsequently disband to receive a \u201ccapital gain.\u201d  \n\n      Financing Sources \n\n In \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d operations, it is possible to select various categories of \n fi nancing sources, equity capital, funds which can be assimilated to equity capital and \ndebt capital, classi fi ed according to their degree of priority with which they are reim-\nbursed, the level called \u201cseniority,\u201d should, in particular, the company project fail or \nbe liquidated. \n\n The equity capital, or risk capital, represents the share capital with which the \ncompany project is provided, in predominant measure, by the promoters of the ini-\ntiative (sponsor or strategic investors) through the subscription of shares or stakes in \nthe company. \n\n   1   Thuraya is a private company, based in the United Arab Emirates, which supplies telecommunication \nsatellite services.  \n\n\n\n226 Space Program Management\n\n The equity capital can be supplied even by different entities than the promoters, \ni.e., the \u201c fi nancial investor,\u201d in the logic, as stated, of pure  fi nancial investment, but \nthis supply is always minor with respect to that of the strategic sponsors. \n\n The share capital can be represented by various classes of shares (common stock, \npreferred stock, etc.) to which different rights on the part of the subscribers are linked. \nThe share capital is deposited when work has progressed, therefore in the manufac-\nturing phase of the work, or when determined planned and/or unforeseen events have \noccurred during the commercial management phase of the initiative. \n\n Satellite projects developed in the last years have presented a rather high  fi nancial \n\u201cleverage.\u201d 2  The companies\u2019 capitalization level is, however, determined according \nto the risk pro fi le of the single initiative, 3  which in turn depends, among other things, \non the \u201ccommitment\u201d level, the commitments to acquire the SPV services, which are \nsubscribed by potential customers of the SPV with the SPV, from technical and tech-\nnological risks of the project. \n\n The funds which can be assimilated to share capital, generally called \u201cquasi-eq-\nuity,\u201d are instead hybrid  fi nancing instruments which have typical characteristics of \nboth risk capital and debt capital. Subordinated loans, mezzanine debt, convertible \nbonds and in general all forms of  fi nancing which are preferred in reimbursement \nwith respect to risk capital but deferred with respect to ordinary and preferred debt \nfall into this category. \n\n The use of \u201cquasi-equity\u201d has the aim of reducing the average weighted cost of \ncapital, since this  fi nancial instrument involves a lesser cost with respect to risk capi-\ntal (even if it is higher with respect to debt capital), does not attribute full rights to \nvote and allows increasing the \u201cleverage\u201d of the project. \n\n Debt capital, called \u201csenior debt,\u201d is made up of bank loans which contracted by \nthe SPV, loans which have reimbursement priority with respect to all other forms of \n fi nancing of the project, concerning both the reimbursement of the capital and the \npayment of interest. In other terms, it can be said that the \u201ccash  fl ow,\u201d generated by \nthe project company can be used  fi rst for loan reimbursement, then for \u201cquasi-entity\u201d \nreimbursement and only in a residual way for the payment of dividends which repre-\nsent the return expected by the shareholders on the risk capital deposited. \n\n Even the debt capital, like the share capital, is provided by the banks to the proj-\nect company on the basis of the work progress status to a  fi nancial plan previously \nevaluated and accepted by the  fi nancers. The satellite programs normally see the \nuse, in the initial phase of the initiative, of risk capital brought by the industrial \npartners as a source of  fi nancing of the project for covering nonrecurrent costs \n(research and development, pre-investment costs, studies, etc.) and, in subsequent \nphases, to the use of debt capital, which is supplied in parts in line with the invest-\nment plan of the project company. \n\n   2   Relationship between risk capital (Equity) and debit capital (Debt).  \n   3   As an example, we can cite the  fi nancing of the New Dawn Satellite Company Ltd., formed by Intelsat \nand a South African investment company, Convergence Partners, whose overall investment value (about \n240 M$) was fi nanced for about 40 M$ through risk capital brought by the partners and for the rest through \nbank  fi nancing of Nedbank Capital and Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa.  \n\n\n\n227Financial Management of Space Programs\n\n Debt capital, because of the minor risks of the reimbursement priority compared \nto other forms of  fi nancing, clearly has a lower cost compared to risk capital and \n\u201cquasi-entity,\u201d and consequently a high  fi nancial leverage with a reduction of the \naverage weighted cost of capital of the initiative. \n\n The debt capital can have different forms, substantially summarized in banking \n fi nancing at short-, medium, and long-term, in bond loans and leasing. \n\n In satellite projects all three  fi nancing instruments can be present, even in combi-\nnation with each other, with a mix and timing which depend on the  fi nancial plan of \nthe SPV and from the type of investments which must be realized.  \n\n      The Economic-Financial Analysis of Space Programs \n\n The proper economic- fi nancial analysis of a project starts from the selection of the \nthree macro-phases that characterize it: construction of the infrastructure,  fi nal/accep-\ntance testing of the infrastructure, commercial management. \n\n The construction phase occurs when the investment is realized; the so-called \nCapex or \u201cCapital Expenditure\u201d and therefore the  fi nancing in risk or debt capital by \n fi nancers are supplied to the SPV. In this phase, the  fi nancing is supplied at the work \nprogress status; therefore, the exposure of the  fi nancers increases according to the \ndevelopment of the infrastructure and reaches its maximum peak at the time prior to \nthe testing/acceptance phase of the infrastructure. The initial phase of the project is \nprecisely the construction of the infrastructure in which the SPV has outbound \n fi nancial  fl ows called \u201ccash out,\u201d represented by inbound investment costs and  fl ows \nrepresented by the supply of \u201cequity\u201d  fi nancing (subscription of shares) and debt \n(supply of  fi nancing). In this phase, the SPV does not generate pro fi ts and cash  fl ows; \ntherefore, it can neither distribute dividends to shareholders nor can it pay interest on \nthe loans supplied, interest which, for this reason, is capitalized and is therefore to be \nadded to the  fi nanced capital, thereby determining the overall amount of the debt to \nbe reimbursed. \n\n The second phase is represented by the testing of the infrastructure, which \nclearly foresees a series of tests de fi ned contractually which, if passed, determine \nthe  fi nal acceptance of the infrastructure, the payment of the balance to the con-\nstructor, and the start-up of a period of guarantee whose duration depends on the \ntype of project and therefore on the type of infrastructure. The testing phase is \nclearly the most critical for  fi nancers, inasmuch as all  fi nancing is supplied but \nthere is no certainty that the infrastructure will pass the  fi nal tests and therefore that \nthe commercial phase can be started up. In the testing phase, the outbound  fl ows \nare represented by  fi nal payments to the constructor and by the functional expenses \nof the facilities, while inbound  fl ows, called \u201ccash-in\u201d are generally still absent at \nleast if, as highlighted, the company does not already provide the so-called \u201cinterim \nservices.\u201d \n\n The third phase of the project is management, in which the SPV provides services \nand therefore generates pro fi ts and inbound cash  fl ows, the \u201ccash-in.\u201d In this phase \nthe company no longer has investment costs inasmuch as the infrastructure has been \ncompleted; however, the cash-out is generated by the company\u2019s operation costs. \n\n In a satellite project, the three phases described above can be graphically repre-\nsented as given in Figure  7.1 .  \n\n\n\n228\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15\n\nLAUNCH\n+ LEOP IOA\n\nmanufacturing test operations\n\nF\nIN\n\nA\nN\n\nC\nIA\n\nL\n E\n\nX\nP\n\nO\nS\n\nU\nR\n\nE\n\nFUNDING REIMBOURSEMENT\n\nYEARS\n\n  Figure 7.1.    Phases of a \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d operation for a satellite project.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n The investment phase includes the construction of the satellite, the launch \n campaign and the LEOP, \u201cLow Earth Orbit Operations\u201d phase; the testing phase \ninvolves the \u201ccommissioning\u201d activities of the satellite and the control center and \nends with the \u201cIn-Orbit,\u201d \u201cAcceptance\u201d or \u201cSystem Acceptance Review,\u201d while the \nmanagement phase begins with the providing of services and ends when the satellite \ncompletes its own operation lifecycle. \n\n Sometimes, in space projects, these phases can partially overlap. For this reason \nan SPV might begin the commercial phase and therefore start generating returns/ fl ows \nof cash before the investment/construction phase has been completed. This occurs in \nparticular in satellite programs in which \u201ctime-to-market,\u201d the SPV\u2019s entrance into \nthe market, represents the main critical factor of success and it is therefore necessary \nto anticipate this phase as much as possible. In these cases, the SPV, in order to ensure \nmarket shares or to capture determined customers, starts up the commercial phase, \n\u201cinterim service,\u201d using nonproprietary satellites (a typical example is the leasing of \ntransponders from existing operators) so that it can complete the construction phase \nand start up service through the satellite infrastructure with a good customer base. \nThe construction phase and the management phase can also overlap when there is a \nmodular-type project, as for example a constellation of satellites which are manufac-\ntured launched and tested in orbit in consecutive phases, and therefore, begin \n commercial operations (operational phase) at different times.  \n\n      Risk Analysis \n\n Risk analysis is an essential aspect for the development of a \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d \noperation and is closely related to the above-mentioned guarantee aspect. \n\n In general terms, the risk must be determined and evaluated in terms of impact on \nthe initiative, eliminated or mitigated, transferred or accepted; in the latter case it will \n\n \n\n\n\n229Financial Management of Space Programs\n\nbe necessary to evaluate adequately the  fi nancial impact related to the possible \n manifestation of risk and therefore provide for necessary reserves. \n\n The division of residual risks mainly involves the strategic partners of the ini-\ntiative (for example, the guarantee of the satellite\u2019s completion will involve the \nmanufacturing company while the commercialization of the service at determined \nprices independently from the economic progress of the market will concern the \nsatellite operator) who will accept the risks according to their ability to manage \nthem, and especially, the economic return of the activity connected to the assump-\ntion of the risk itself. \n\n A proper division of the risks is essential for the success of an operation of \n\u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d inasmuch as it confers stability and equilibrium to the latter \nand, de fi nitely, ensures the technical-economic and  fi nancial feasibility and conse-\nquently bankability. \n\n The concept of  fi nancial feasibility is a \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d operation which coin-\ncides with bankability; a project can be de fi ned as \u201cbankable\u201d when the risks associ-\nated with it are for the most part acceptable to banks considering the  fi nancial return \nderiving from the  fi nancial operation, a return which is considered lower to the one \nexpected by shareholders because they bear risks which are higher compared to \nbanks, and as a result, expect a higher return on investment; the ROE, \u201cReturn on \nEquity\u201d is in fact higher to the expected return from a bank on a  fi nance operation, a \nreturn made up of the interest, commissions and costs related to the loan. \n\n It is therefore worthwhile to point out that, even with a high  fi nancial return on the \noperation (high interest rate on the loan, high commissions, etc.) banks will not \naccept running risks which are not ef fi cient for their business and will ask the spon-\nsors/shareholders for various kinds of guarantees; however, they will all be aimed at \nensuring the proper implementation of the project as well as to partially recovering \nthe loans provided. Regarding this, it should be emphasized that the problem of the \nguarantees is so important in \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d operations that, precisely on the \nbasis of the guarantees, we can de fi ne two macro-categories of  fi nancing, \u201cwithout \nrecourse\u201d and \u201climited recourse.\u201d \n\n The de fi nition of \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d \u201cwithout recourse,\u201d without recourse on the \nsponsors, indicates a  fi nancing operation in which the bankability of the project is \nbased solely on the ability of the project to generate cash  fl ows in such a way as to \nguarantee the servicing of the debt, i.e., the reimbursement of the bank loan and on \nthe value of the \u201cassets\u201d of the project company. However, it is rarely applied and in \nreality all \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d operations are of \u201climited recourse,\u201d with limited \nrecourse on the sponsors and therefore foresee the obligations by the sponsors, c.d. \n\u201csecond-line guarantees\u201d which together with cash  fl ow expected from the initiative \nand contractual guarantees which will be dealt with afterwards, are a necessary condi-\ntion for the bankability of an initiative. \n\n This involves limited recourse because the guarantees do not cover the entire value \nof  fi nancing (capital plus interest) but only a part of them, implying the direct \nassumption of commercial risks by the banks. \n\n Second-line guarantees are mainly  fi nancial in nature and are made up of, for \nexample, the commitment by the sponsors to deposit added share capital should \ninvestment costs increase or management of the company (and/or deterioration of \nseveral indices of  fi nancial coverage or pro fi tability of the project company), from the \n\n\n\n230 Space Program Management\n\ncommitment to inject liquidity in the project company to satisfy the need for \n circulating capital and other needs. \n\n Sometimes, especially during the  fi rst phase of commercial management of the \ninitiative, the sponsors can also be required to counter-guarantee the bonds of a \n commercial counterpart, and in this case, the guarantee can be made up of the com-\nmitment to buy at determined prices and determined quantities of products or services \nof the project company. \n\n The second-line guarantees can take on various forms, but as wide-ranging as they \nmay be, they cannot be substituted by contractual guarantees which in any case \n represent the cornerstone of a \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d operation. \n\n The contractual guarantees involve legal bonds subscribed by the participating \nentities to an initiative to guarantee the respect of the underlying assumptions of the \nSPV\u2019s \u201cbusiness plan\u201d and therefore to reduce its economic- fi nancial volatility. \n\n Therefore, the contractual guarantees impact the cost and pro fi t components of the \ninitiative and its pro fi tability. The contractual guarantees are represented, in particu-\nlar, regarding costs, by the manufacturing contracts, the \u201cturn-key contract,\u201d or on \nthose from the returns on the cession contracts from products/services. \n\n In addition to these essential contracts, there are those of a strictly  fi nancial nature, \nsuch as the  fi nancing agreement, the guarantees on project assets, and in a more gen-\neral way, the overall legal/contractual documentation of the project which, in order to \nensure the success of the operation, it is crucial that it be consistent, harmonized, and \nin particular, balanced in the division of risks among the various parties involved in \nthe development of the initiative.  \n\n      Contractual Aspects \n\n In a satellite project, the principal contracts can be schematized as follows in \nFigure  7.2 . \n\n    (a)     The contract for supplying an in-orbit satellite system, IOD \u201cIn-orbit-delivery \ncontract\u201d IODs and ground infrastructure (the \u201cground segment\u201d and if provided \nfor, the \u201cnetwork control centers\u201d and \u201clocal gateways\u201d):     \n\n It is stipulated in most cases directly between the project company and satellite \nmanufacturing company; it is a \u201c fi rm  fi xed price contract\u201d which provides for the \nin-orbit satellite supply fully tested and functioning and therefore includes LEOP\u2014\n\u201cLaunch and Early Orbit Phase\u201d services\u2014the control activities of the satellite after \nseparation from the launcher and up to positioning in  fi nal orbit, and the \u201ccommis-\nsioning\u201d and IOT, \u201cin-orbit testing.\u201d \n\n Payments are made to the WPS, Works Progress Status, according to a detailed \nplan of key steps, invoicing and payment. \n\n In most cases the contract provides for, in addition to penalty mechanisms for \ndelayed delivery which foresees as a last resort the possible unilateral \u201ctermination\u201d \nshould there be serious contractual nonful fi llments by the supplier, including a \nmechanism of penalties related to malfunctioning in orbit of the satellite and/or \nground infrastructure. \n\n This mechanism foresees that a determined percentage of the price (in general \nbetween 5% and 20%) is returned to the supplier, the \u201ccontractor,\u201d only if the space \n\n\n\n231\n\nPROJECT\nCOMPANY\n\n(SPV)\n\nLaunch Services\ncontract\n\nIOD\ncontracts\n\nBANKS\n\nFinancing\nAgreements\n\nINSURERS\n\nIn Orbit Life \nInsurance\n\nLaunch Insurance,\nother insurances\n\nCUSTOMER # 1\n\nCUSTOMER # 2\n\nCUSTOMER # N.\n\nCapacity lease\nContracts\n\nOTHER\nSTAKEHOLDERS\n\nFOUNDING\nSTAKEHOLDERS\n\nAgreements \nsubscriptions\nshares\n\nSYSTEM\nMANUFACTURE\n\nLAUNCH\nPROVIDER\n\nPUBLIC ENTITIES\n\nLicences,\nauthorizations,\n\n\u2026.\n\nAgreements \nsubscriptions\nshares\n\n  Figure 7.2.    Contractual schema of a \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d operation for a satellite project.       \n\nFinancial Management of Space Programs\n\nsystem, satellite and control center are in compliance with technical speci fi cations \nand therefore perfectly functioning at the end of the LEOP, In-Orbit Commissioning \nand Testing phase. \n\n Should this not occur, the contract foresees the application of penalties (nonpay-\nment of part of the price) of an increasing amount according to the seriousness of the \nanomalies found. In some cases it is also foreseen that the share payment of the sup-\nplier be spread out over a variable period, in general, between 3 and 7 years, and that \nit can be withheld from the SPV in the case of the in-orbit malfunctioning of the satel-\nlite which appear in the subsequent years of in-orbit acceptance of the satellite. \n\n For IOD contracts, after the  fi nal acceptance of the system, a period of guarantee \nis always foreseen at least 1 year for the ground infrastructure, as well as the obliga-\ntion on the part of the supplier to perform at his expense all the activities to correct \npossible malfunctioning of the satellite. \n\n In addition, other obligations assumed by the supplier include the supply of all \nequipment, data, documentation and software for managing the systems, the retrieval \nof all licenses, authorizations and import\u2013export permits and, generally, all activities \naimed at coordinating the orbital position and frequencies with the ITU, the \n\u201cInternational Communication Union.\u201d \n\n Finally, customer support in the choice of launch service provider, negotiation of \nthe relative contract and sometimes the negotiation of insurance contracts, \u201cLaunch-\nInsurance and In-Orbit Insurance\u201d can enter into the scope of the contract.\n\n    (b)    Supply of launch service contract, LSC \u201cLaunch Services Contract\u201d:     \n\n It is generally stipulated by the SPV with a \u201cLaunch Service Provider\u201d an LSP \nsuch as Arianespace, Sea-Launch, the ILS and directly  fi nanced by it. \n\n The management of the contract is normally done directly with the contractor who \ncan also manage relative payments, which are also made at work progress status. \n\n \n\n\n\n232 Space Program Management\n\n The LSC, also at  fi rm and  fi xed price, de fi nes in detail the activities which are the \nresponsibility of the LSP (obtaining necessary licenses and authorizations from local \nauthorities, effecting the launch according to agreed launch windows, possible \n re-launch of the satellite in case of failure or breakdown of the launcher, etc.) and \nthose which are the contractor\u2019s responsibility (obtaining authorization from the \nauthorities of his/her country, transport of the satellite to the launch site, preparation \nof the satellite for launch, post-launch satellite management). \n\n The contract obviously de fi nes the timeframe windows of the launch and the recip-\nrocal commitments should there be delays for having the satellite ready by the con-\ntractor or the delay of the launch for reasons which could be attributed to the launcher. \nPrecisely de fi ne the LSP provider\u2019s obligations in case of launch failure and envis-\nages, as does any service contract, the penalty system of the LSP for nonful fi llment, \nthe causes of withdrawal, force majeure, transfer of risks, etc. \n\n It is worth noting that sometimes the supply of launch service is an integral part of \nthe obligations foreseen in the above IOD contract; in this case the LSC will be a \nsubcontract stipulated between the contract and the LSP.\n\n    (c)     Insurance contracts the \u201cPre-launch Insurance,\u201d \u201cLaunch and In-Orbit-Insurance,\u201d \n\u201cIn-Orbit-Incentives Insurance,\u201d \u201cand political risk insurance\u201d etc.):     \n\n Represent one of the main aspects of contract structure which characterizes a \n\u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d operation in the space sector. \n\n They can represent, on the whole, the third cost item of a satellite project; their \ncontents vary according to the risks covered, their value and their duration. \n\n With the exception of the \u201cpre-Launch\u201d policy, which has rather standard features \n(ensures the satellite against damages which can occur to it during the transport \nphase and during activities at the launch site up to the starting of the launcher\u2019s \nmotors), the \u201cLaunch and In-Orbit Insurance\u201d and the \u201cIn-Orbit-Incentives Insurance,\u201d \nor the \u201cIn-Orbit Life Insurance\u201d vary signi fi cantly according to the risks actually \ninsured of the exclusions, exemptions, deductibles, etc. \n\n If we wish to schematize these coverages we can state with several simpli fi cations \nthat the \u201cLaunch and In-Orbit-Insurance\u201d insures the satellite against risks of total \nand partial loss for reasons due to partial or total breakdown of the launcher (includ-\ning the positioning in an improper transfer orbit) and/or problems which occurred \nduring the LEOP phase, Commissioning and IOT, while the \u201cIn-Orbit-Incentives \nInsurance\u201d insures the risks of total or partial malfunction which could occur to the \nsatellite after the IOT phase. \n\n The duration of this policy depends on the insurance market\u2019s ability at the time \nof risk classi fi cation, in general, their duration is around 3\u20135 years; the values to be \ninsured are determined on the basis of rebuilding the satellite, the launch and related \ninsurance. \n\n The process of insuring a satellite is extremely complex and typically begins with \nthe selection by the manufacturer or the SPV of an insurance broker who presents to \nthe potential subscribers, the \u201cunderwriters,\u201d a report containing information of a \ntechnical, contractual, and economic nature on the operation; the \u201cunderwriters\u201d con-\nduct an in-depth analysis to evaluate the risk to be insured (reliability of the satellite \nand launcher, orbit location of the satellite, etc.) and present offers containing the \nconditions and terms of the insurance coverage to the broker. \n\n\n\n233Financial Management of Space Programs\n\n The economic conditions offered depend not only on the \u201crisk analysis\u201d of the \nspeci fi c operation, but also on the ability of the insurance market, which is related \ninversely to the premium level. When the economic conditions are generally favor-\nable, the insurance company has in general good economic- fi nancial performance and \ncan offer high insurance capacity and levels of appropriate premium levels, the exact \ncontrary is demonstrated in general adverse economic conditions, in which there can \nbe impacts on the company\u2019s business plan for the project company which are quite \nsigni fi cant and which can sometimes alter the pro fi t pro fi le of the initiative. \n\n The insurance process proceeds with the presentation of offer to the customer, the \nselection of what best responds to his needs, the stipulation of the insurance contract \nand the payment of the premium which is a necessary condition for the policy to enter \ninto effect. \n\n In addition to the above-mentioned insurances, there are also those against political \nand commercial risk, those of civil responsibility vs. third parties, \u201cThird Party Space \nLiability,\u201d coverage against damage to property, \u201cProperty Damage\u201d and \u201cBusiness \nInterruption\u201d and generic business policies, Directors and Of fi cers, General Liability.\n\n    (d)     Contracts for service provision (\u201ccapacity lease agreements,\u201d \u201cimagery services \ncontracts,\u201d etc.):     \n\n They are stipulated between the SPV and its customers, who can be \u201cwholesale\u201d cus-\ntomers, regional or local operators who buy wholesale, or \u201cretail\u201d customers,  fi nal users \nof services, according to the business or distribution model of the project company. \n\n In the satellite programs  fi nanced on the basis of \u201cproject- fi nance\u201d it is important \nthat such contracts are of multiyear duration that they are stipulated with reliable \ncounterparts from the commercial and  fi nancial viewpoint that they absorb in good \npart the operational capability of the satellite, that they are already started up, at least \nwith main customers, at the time of start-up of operations of the system. \n\n In addition to the multiyear contracts there are temporary contracts which \nforesee, for example, the allocation of \u201con-demand\u201d capacities for digital video \nbroadcasting, or the provision of satellite images related to speci fi c requirements \n(a typical example is that of images taken during crisis situations,  fl oods, earth-\nquakes, nuclear accidents, etc.). \n\n From the banks\u2019 viewpoint, it is important that such contracts are preceded by \n\u201cletters of interest\u201d on the part of potential customers, and that the project company \nbegins to provide several services before the start-up of the system\u2019s operation using \nother satellites (cd. \u201cinterim system services\u201d) so as to capture and to loyalize a poten-\ntial customer. \n\n It is important to underscore that the ownership of rights originating from the con-\ntracts under examination, as well as those deriving from other contracts concerning the \nproject, are in general transferable from the project company to the  fi nancial institu-\ntions on the basis of clauses contained in the contracts and  fi nancing agreements.\n\n    (e)    Financing contracts:     \n\n The contents of these contracts vary according to the type of  fi nancing which is \nagreed upon with the project company. \n\n The  fi nancing structured in the framework of an operation of \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d \ncan take on different forms, often present contemporaneously in a same project. \n\n\n\n234 Space Program Management\n\n As evidenced above,  fi nancing can be in the form of bank bonds, exportation, leasing \nand co- fi nancing, direct  fi nancing by the system supplier\u2014\u201cvendor  fi nancing.\u201d \n\n The relative contracts are in general very complicated and cannot be described in \ndetail in this book; in any case, their basic elements are: the  fi nancial amount, their \ndestination, the guarantees, interest rate, commissions, means and period for payment \nand reimbursement, suspending conditions for the effectiveness of the  fi nancing, \n fi nancial obligations to be maintained, etc. Financing contracts are clearly regulated \nby the company\u2019s business plan and are directly stipulated by the project company or \nby the companies controlled by it, with its  fi nancers. \n\n In addition to the above identi fi ed    contracts which however do not complete the \ncontractual structure of a satellite \u201cproject  fi nancing,\u201d there are the government autho-\nrizes and permits which are required for the manufacture, launch and management of \nthe satellite and its related ground infrastructure. \n\n The most signi fi cant part of these authorizations is made up of the licenses and \nrelated agreements to orbital position and the relative spectrum of frequencies. In \naddition to these authorizations are the licenses for the deployment and manage-\nment of the gateways and  fi xed and mobile terminals (where present) which are in \ngeneral the responsibility of local operators, but which represent, in any case, one \nof the main critical factors of success of the initiatives which are the object \n fi nancing and are therefore carefully evaluated by  fi nancers because of their impact \non possible delays in obtaining authorizations that can cause on the pro fi t pro fi le of \nthe initiative.  \n\n      Analysis of the \u201cBusiness Plan\u201d for Space Programs \n\n The \u201cbusiness plan\u201d is the cornerstone of any  fi nancial operation of the project. It \ninvolves an information document, which describes the project to potential investors \nand  fi nancers\u2014whether they are bringing risk or debt capital\u2014from the qualitative \nand quantitative points of view. \n\n The \u201cbusiness plan\u201d contains all the elements relevant to the purposes of the \ninvestment decision, such as:\n\n   The aim of the project  \u2022 \n  The sponsors and their roles  \u2022 \n  Market analysis  \u2022 \n  Technical and technological aspects  \u2022 \n  Regulatory, contractual and legal aspects  \u2022 \n  Company structure of the SPV and \u201ccorporate governance\u201d regulations  \u2022 \n  Risk factors  \u2022 \n  Economic- fi nance plan    \u2022 \n\n The  fi rst draft of the business plan is done by the strategic sponsors of the initiative \nand has the objective of de fi ning the project idea, qualifying the main elements and \nquantifying as a  fi rst step its economic range. \n\n The business plan is then subject to elaborations and subsequent re fi nements \nwhich re fl ect the level of detail of the analyses performed and, in almost all cases, \nthe analyses and considerations done by the consulting company which, usually, are \n\n\n\n235Financial Management of Space Programs\n\nthe responsibility of the sponsors (or the SPV directly) to re fi ne the business plan and \nvalidate it before presenting it to potential investors. \n\n The  fi rst dif fi culty we encounter in the elaboration of the business plan involves \nquantifying the overall demand for services/products, which will be offered by the \nproject company and in determining the market share to be reached on the basis of \nthe sales price of the product/service offered. \n\n The dif fi culty of carrying out a proper analysis of demand is directly proportional \nto the level of innovation of the service and the product offered, and therefore, the \navailability or not of information and qualitative and quantitative data which allow \nperforming a \u201cbenchmarking\u201d between the \u201cbusiness plan\u201d of the speci fi c initiative \nand that of similar projects. \n\n It should be stated, however, that even in the case of projects which are based on \ntechnologies, services and/or products which do not present particular characteristics \nin terms of innovation, the analysis of demand and evaluations of competitive posi-\ntioning of the project company represent without doubt one of the most dif fi cult, if \nperhaps the most dif fi cult to analyze in the \u201cbusiness plan.\u201d \n\n For this reason, it is a standard practice for the sponsors of the initiative to confer \nwith a consulting company specialized in analyzing in detail the \u201cbusiness plans\u201d of \ninitiatives and therefore validating it in the eyes of potential  fi nancers; obviously this \nvalidation will be useful only in the case the consulting company has a speci fi c \nknowledge of the reference market and of the commercial dynamics related to the \ninitiative which is the object of  fi nancing. \n\n Since the causes of failure of \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d operations are for the most \npart the result (see the example of Globalstar and Iridium) of a mistaken analysis \nof demand, also meaning a mistaken evaluation of \u201cpricing\u201d to be applied to the \nproduct/service offered, the  fi nancers of the initiative will have to pay close atten-\ntion to this aspect and will therefore carefully subject the economic- fi nancial \nmodel of the project to a \u201csensitivity analysis\u201d which will basically measure the \nvariations of the pro fi tability indicators of the initiative, in particular, the IRR \n\u201cInternal Rate of Return,\u201d according to the different cost parameters (increase of \ninvestment and operational costs of the SPV) and pro fi t (increase/decrease of sales \nconsidering different market scenarios and/or \u201cpricing\u201d of the product/service \noffered by the SPV). \n\n A second essential aspect of the \u201cbusiness plan\u201d refers to the technical and tech-\nnological aspects of the project which must be analyzed with the aim of demonstrat-\ning technical feasibility,  fi rst of all, of the initiative and, where present, the related \ntechnical risks clearly. \n\n Even in this case, the greater the degree of technical complexity of the project, \nthe lesser the degree of satisfaction of the initiative on the part of  fi nancers. This \nis because a high degree of technical complexity of the project is usually associ-\nated with the risk of cost overruns or the prolonging of realization time of the \nproject which can also impact in a determining way on the pro fi t pro fi le of the \ninitiative. \n\n It is therefore appropriate to base the project on technical solutions which limit or \neven cancel out risks of delay in the realization time of the work, or of extra costs or \neven malfunctioning of the infrastructure through which the service will be provided \nby the project company. \n\n\n\n236 Space Program Management\n\n It is evident that this aspect assumes essential importance in the case of projects in \nthe space sector where improper technical and technological choices, not being able to \nbe modi fi ed in the manufacturing phase, can determine the failure of the initiative. \n\n Another essential point to be considered is without doubt represented by the spon-\nsor team, their level of experience in developing analogous initiatives or similar to \nthe investment objective, and from the level of  fi nancial participation in the initiative \nthat obviously determines the level of  fi nancial risk assumed by the sponsors and \ntherefore their \u201ccommitment\u201d to the initiative. \n\n We begin with the assumption that a \u201cproject  fi nancing\u201d operation usually has \nimportant economic scope and requires participation by entities which have different \ncompetences and often con fl icting interests that must necessarily  fi nd a point of bal-\nance to allow the proper management of the project. \n\n For example, let us examine the case of a satellite project which has among its \nsponsors a space manufacturing company and a satellite operator. The interests of \nthese entities will necessarily diverge because the manufacturer will try to maximize \nits own economic return in the industrial implementation phase of the initiative, while \nthe satellite operator will try to reduce costs and development time of the infrastruc-\nture to maximize return on investment, a return which will in any case be evaluated \naccording to a long-term period related to the commercial operation of the system, \nwhich in and of itself, is a logic which is far removed from a manufacturer. \n\n It is nevertheless essential that the entities with the necessary competences to \ndevelop the initiative are part of the sponsor team and participate effectively to the \n fi nancing of the initiative. \n\n Another important element to analyze is represented by the regulatory and legal \naspects, inasmuch as they can greatly impact the development time of the initiative \nand sometimes prevent the success of the programs. \n\n For example, the import\u2013export problems related to satellite programs which use \nmaterials subject to EAR or ITAR regulations of the USA, or regulatory problems \nboth at an international level (ITU) and at a national level related to the allocation and \nuse of frequencies, or to permit required for the deployment of ground infrastructures \nnecessary for supplying services in the framework of telecommunication or satellite \nnavigation programs. \n\n All these aspects will have to be clearly analyzed and evaluated especially con-\ncerning the impact they can have on the time of development of the initiative, an \nessential aspect, especially for commercial-type initiatives where the \u201ctime to mar-\nket\u201d of the service offered is a critical factor for the initiative\u2019s success. \n\n Moreover, it will be important to describe the contractual structure of the initiative, \nstarting from the supply of the infrastructure (what is being supplied, price schedule, \npenalty system, guarantees, etc.) which will have to provide adequate security to \n fi nancers, to banks in particular, regarding the costs and times of development of the \ninfrastructure, to arrive to those related to concession contracts of the services will \nhave to be, where possible,  fi nalized, at least partially, in relation to the subscription \nto  fi nancing agreements. \n\n Finally, as part of the evaluation of contractual and legal aspects of the initiative is the \n\u201csecurity package,\u201d or the contractual and real system of guarantee of various types \nwhich is structured in the framework of the  fi nancial operations of the project it repre-\nsents, de-facto, the only instrument for mitigating the risks associated with the project.  \n\n\n\n237Financial Management of Space Programs\n\n      Example of a \u201cBusiness Case\u201d \n\n The business case which will be examined as an example is represented by the \n planning, construction, and management of a satellite system for broadband commu-\nnication services with multi-spot coverage over Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. \n\n The  fi nancing of the project occurs on a \u201cproject- fi nance\u201d base, with contributions \ntherefore of risk capital by sponsors/shareholders of the project company and bank \n fi nancing. \n\n The value of the initiative amounts to 300 million euro and includes costs for real-\nizing the infrastructure (space and ground segment, described as follows), the launch \nservice and insurance premiums, project development costs, preoperational expenses, \nand interests matured during the construction period. \n\n The value of the initiative does not include development costs (construction and \ninstallation) of the ground network which the \u201cbusiness plan\u201d foresees as being the \nresponsibility of local operators. \n\n For realizing the project its promoters have established a vehicle company, an SPV \ncalled SAT-Pro, which will receive the necessary  fi nancing to cover the needs \nspeci fi ed above and will stipulate active and passive contracts described as follows. \n\n      The SAT-Pro System \n The system is made up of two main segments: space and ground. \n\n The space segment, the property of the SPV, is represented by a geostationary \nsatellite for telecommunications and by a ground control center (NCC \u201cNetwork \nControl Center\u201d) with control functions of the satellite and allocation of its transmit-\nting capability to the telecommunications operators. \n\n The ground segment includes the stations, \u201cgateways,\u201d needed for managing and \ncontrolling the network of operators and  fi xed and mobile terminals of telecommuni-\ncations linked with this network. \n\n The \u201cbusiness plan\u201d assumes that the ground segment will be developed by a net-\nwork of regional operators, who, located in the various countries covered by the \nservice, will stipulate multiyear service contracts with the SPV. \n\n The business plan therefore foresees that these operators have the property and \ntherefore  fi nance the making of the ground stations and distribute the  fi xed and \nmobile telecommunication terminals, the \u201cend-user terminals\u201d to the  fi nal users. \n\n The costs related to the development of the ground segment are therefore not con-\nsidered in the business case described as follows.  \n\n      The SPV Project Company \n The project company, called SAT-Pro, is located in Alfa country, where it can bene fi t \nfrom a favorable  fi scal policy. \n\n Its shareholders of reference, or strategic sponsors, are the Sat-Manufacturing \nS.A., a major manufacturing company of satellites which will develop and build on \nthe behalf of SPV the space segment, the Gat-Manufacturing Ltd., the producer com-\npany of gateways and user-terminals which will provide the ground segment neces-\nsary for supplying telecommunication services via satellite, two regional operators of \ntelecommunications, Sat-Service X and Sat-Service Y, which will have, respectively, \nexclusive distributing rights of telecommunication services to the SAT-Pro in several \ncountries covered by the service. \n\n\n\n238 Space Program Management\n\n With a total investment cost of 330 million euro, the strategic sponsors have \n committed themselves to  fi nancing the Sat-Pro, with risk capital, \u201cequity\u201d up to \n100 million euro, the remaining share of investment is expected to be  fi nanced for \n200 million euro with bank  fi nancing \u201cdebt\u201d and for the remaining share of 30 million \neuro through  fi nancing for the research and development provided by several institu-\ntional agencies. \n\n The \u201cdebt/equity\u201d relationship therefore presents a high  fi nancial leverage.  \n\n      The Investment \n The total costs of  fi nancing amount to 330 million euro and include:  \n\n Cost (in millions of \u20ac) \n\n Satellite  147 \n\n Control center (NCC)  54 \n\n Launch service  82 \n\n Insurance policies  37 \n\n LEOP + commissioning  10 \n\n Total cost of the project  330 \n\n The investment period (construction phase) is 2 years, the management period \n(commercialization of the service), even if the life cycle of the satellite is estimated \nto be 15 years, it is prudent to determine it in 13 years to take into account possible \ndeterioration in the transmitting capabilities of the satellite during the  fi nal phase of \nits operational life cycle. \n\n Given the type of investment realized a start-up phase is not foreseen. In fact, once \nit has been completed, launched and tested in orbit it is expected that the satellite will \noperate at 100% of its transmission capability. \n\n The time management plan of the construction activity and system launch is indi-\ncated in the following  fi gure (   Figure  7.3 ).   \n\n      Returns \n The returns from the SPV are estimated assuming that the provision of services \noccurs in three different geographical areas, in which there is expected to be an \nincrease in demand, with a tendency to saturate the transmitting capability of the \nsatellite already at the end of the fourth year of commercialization of the service. \n\n Beginning in the  fi fth year, the returns are expected to be stable because of this \nsaturation, while increase in demand for the services offered is expected to increase \nand therefore offer wide margins of security with respect to the expected level of \nreturns. \n\n The return hypotheses assume a market penetration by the SPV in the order of \n30% of overall potential demand expected in the three geographical areas of service \ncoverage, according to the category of users. \n\n The overall demand has been evaluated through speci fi c market studies \u201cprimary \nresearch,\u201d commissioned especially by the SPV, a primary consulting  fi rm. \n\n\n\n239\n\nYear 1 Year 2\n2\u00b0 Bim. 3\u00b0 Bim. 4\u00b0 Bim. 5\u00b0 Bim.1\u00b0 Bim. 6\u00b0 Bim. 2\u00b0 Bim. 3\u00b0 Bim. 4\u00b0 Bim. 5\u00b0 Bim.1\u00b0 Bim. 6\u00b0 Bim.\n\nSpace Segment\n\nSatellite Platform\n\nPayload\n\nAIT\n\nLaunch Operation\n\nGround Segment\n\n  \nLeop/IOT\n\nCommissioning\n\n  Figure 7.3.    Implementation phases of the SAT-Pro system.       \n\nFinancial Management of Space Programs\n\n The returns of the  fi rst year of commercial operation (or the third year of the plan) \nare equal to 50% of those of the second year of operations inasmuch as the service is \nprovided beginning in the second semester. \n\n The business model of the SPV assumes that the SPV will operate as a \u201cwhole-\nsale\u201d supplier and will see its transmitting capability to regional service providers \nwho in turn will offer  fi xed and mobile telecommunication services to  fi nal users; the \nSPV is therefore not involved in providing \u201cretail\u201d-based services\u2014offers directly \nmade to  fi nal users.  \n\n      Operational Costs \n The operational costs of the SPV are divided into seven items identi fi ed below:\n\n   Human resources   \u2013\n  Maintenance   \u2013\n  Marketing and sales   \u2013\n  Royalties   \u2013\n  Insurance policies   \u2013\n  Outsourcing services   \u2013\n  Other costs     \u2013\n\n Human resources costs include both those for direct human resources and indirect \nhuman resources. They increase 2% per year and include social security and  fi scal \nrequirements. \n\n There are no staff costs during the investment/construction phase of the project \nbecause the \u201cbusiness plan\u201d assumes that in this phase the SPV will use staff provided \nby the sponsor with relative costs taken on by the sponsors themselves. \n\n Maintenance costs are related to maintenance services to the NCC, to the updating \nof the software, to the maintenance of of fi ces and general facilities. \n\n The maintenance costs of the NCC are calculated parametrically according to the \nvalue of the NCC itself. \n\n The maintenance costs increase by 3% each year in line with the average increases \nregistered in companies operating in the same sector. \n\n \n\n\n\n240 Space Program Management\n\n Marketing and sales costs are calculated as 5% of returns, including distribution, \nadvertising and promotional activities costs; the marketing and sales cost value is con-\ntained in consideration of the business model of the company, based as we have stated \non the providing of services to service providers and not to \u201cretail\u201d customers. \n\n \u201cRoyalties\u201d includes amounts that the Sat-Pro has committed to pay public \ninstitutions which it is expected will provide  fi nancing to cover several nonrecur-\nring costs\u2014research and development\u2014of the satellite. \n\n The \u201croyalties\u201d are calculated as a percentage of returns which the project \n company will develop in the planned period (15 years). \n\n Insurance costs mainly concern the insurance of the satellite against risks related \nto the launcher, \u201cLaunch Insurance,\u201d and to LEOP activities, until the positioning of \nthe satellite in the de fi nitive orbit. \n\n These costs are to be considered as investment item and therefore are presented in \nthe table as source use under \u201cInsurance.\u201d \n\n The insurance premiums for this coverage have been estimated according to the \nvalue of rebuilding the satellite, the cost of a new launch and the value of the corre-\nsponding insurance premium. \n\n The insurance costs which have instead been presented in the table of eco-\nnomic account refer to civil responsibility policies for damage to the control \ncenter, for political risk and general risks related to the company\u2019s business. They \namount to 3 million euro the  fi rst year of operation for the service and increase \nby 1% each year. \n\n The SAT-Pro business plan does not provide for insurance coverage for possible \nperformance deterioration of the satellite during its operational life. \n\n The costs for outsourcing services are estimated at around 3 million euro per year. \n The \u201cother expenses\u201d item includes other possible operating expenses which will \n\nhave to be supported by the project company. A 2% increase per year is also expected \nfor this item. \n\n Amortization costs of investment are established at about 8% per year. It is \nexpected therefore that the investment, from an economic point of view, will be \n covered for 13 years. \n\n The  fi scal charge is equal to 35% of pro fi ts and does not vary during the life of the \nproject. \n\n Financial charges and proceeds are calculated, respectively, at an annual interest \nrate, respectively, 5% and 3%.  \n\n      Economic-Financial Model \n The economic- fi nancial model is essentially made up of:\n\n   A Sources and Uses of Funds table which highlights the requirements for funds for \u2022 \nrealizing the infrastructure, the CAPEX \u201cCapital Expenditures\u201d and different \nsources from which we can acquire  fi nancing.  \n  An Economic-Account table which juxtaposes costs and returns according to the \u2022 \nadministrative period and thus illustrates the economic result of the management in \nthe planning years. The economic account in particular points out all the factors \nwhich have contributed to the management cycle and allows  fi nding the partial results \nof all management phases in which the company\u2019s activities can be broken down.  \n\n\n\n241Financial Management of Space Programs\n\n  An Assets and Liabilities table which provides a picture of the assets and liabilities \u2022 \nof the business at any given moment, comparing assets and liabilities. By using \nthis table we can see what are the sources of  fi nancing and the investments carried \nout by the business.  \n  A \u201cCash Flow\u201d table which presents the amount of  fi nancial availability which is \u2022 \ngenerated in the company in a determined period of time. This corresponds to the \nbalance between current incomes (business income) the current outlays (costs di \ncompetence for the period) which have generated a  fi nancial disbursement. In \nanalyzing the investments, the cash  fl ow table indicates all the entries (income) \nand outlays (disbursements) which are generated during the operating life of the \nproject. A recapitulation table of the economic- fi nancial model results which \ninclude two categories of indicators: pro fi tability investment and  fi nancial cover-\nage of the project.    \n\n Indices of pro fi tability are shown as the IRR which corresponds to the interest rate \nwhich makes null the algebraic sum of cash  fl ows actualized by the project and the \n\u201cNet Present Value\u201d (NPV) which is the algebraic sum of the project cash  fl ows actu-\nalized as a rate equal to the opportunity cost of capital, the \u201ccut-off rate.\u201d \n\n The IRR and the NPV are indicators which are calculated to verify the conve-\nnience on the part of promoters of realizing the project. They therefore emphasize the \nability of the project to create wealth and only indirectly express the capability of the \nproject to reimburse and remunerate debt capital. \n\n Debt capital, an important aspect, can be evaluated instead through the indices of \ndebt coverage which represent in particular for the banks an essential element of \nevaluation for the viability of an initiative. \n\n The main indices of coverage are the Pcr \u201cProject cover ratio,\u201d which expresses \nthe relationship between the current net value of cash  fl ows over the life of the proj-\nect and the current debt value; the Adscr \u201cAnnual debt service cover ratio\u201d which \nmeasures the ratio between cash  fl ow of the project (net of taxes) for a given year \nand the service of total debt of the year; and the Lldscr \u201cLoan life debt service cover \nratio\u201d which measures the ratio between the current net value of cash  fl ows for the \nduration of the  fi nancing and the debt value at the beginning of the actualization \nperiod. \n\n The  fi nancial analysis based on these hypotheses highlights a return on investment \nIRR equal to about 28% which much be higher than the pro fi tability pro fi le of the \ninitiative with the same characteristics in the same sector. \n\n The analysis shows that an initiative characterized by a good pro fi tability pro fi le \nand signi fi cant cash  fl ows already beginning in the fourth or  fi fth years, a circum-\nstance which allows shareholders to minimize recover time for capital invested, the \n\u201cpay-back period\u201d and therefore to contain, given the overall pro fi tability of the ini-\ntiative, the riskiness of the project from the timing point of view. \n\n The \u201cleverage\u201d degree of the project is rather low, even because of the public \ncontributions covering in part the costs of research and development. \n\n The indices of debt coverage offer high security margins in consideration of the \n\u201ccash  fl ow\u201d expected and rather the limited  fi nancial leverage. \n\n In the evaluation of a \u201cbusiness plan\u201d the analysis of the above-described tables is \nabsolutely essential. \n\n\n\n242\n\nSATPRO PROJECT\n\nYEAR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 tot.\n\nSatellite 80.00 67.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 147.00\nLaunch + Leop / Commissioning 0.00 92.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 92.00\nInsurance 0.00 37.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 37.00\n\nSPACE SEGMENT 80.00 196.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 276.00\n\nGROUND SEGMENT 24.00 30.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 54.00\n\nINTANGIBLES 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\n\nTOTAL FIXED ASSETS 104.00 226.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 330.00\n\nPRE-OPERATIONAL EXPENSES 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00\n\nTOTAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS 104.00 226.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 330.00\n\nLong Term Debt 24.00 176.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 200.00\n\nEquity + R&D Funding 80.00 50.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 130.00\n\nTOTAL SOURCES 104.00 226.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 330.00\n\n  Figure 7.4.

It is therefore essential not only because it re fl ects the \nproject situation in its initial con fi guration but also because it synthesizes the contrac-\ntual structure of the project and the interest of the various parties involved in it in a \ndynamic way and therefore changes according to new market,  fi nancial and contrac-\ntual scenarios which might come into play in the structuring

Spagnulo et al., Space Program Management: Methods and Tools, \nSpace Technology Library 28, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-3755-0_8, \n\u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013\n\n    8.1.   Small Space in Perspective \n\n Small spacecraft were the  fi rst spacecraft. They pioneered all of the major applications \nof space (excepting human space  fl ight) including spacecraft technology (Sputnik, \n83 kg, 1957) space research (Explorer 1, 14 kg, 1958), remote sensing of the earth \n(Explorer 6, 64 kg, 1959), and communications (from low earth orbit, Telstar, 77 kg, \n1962, from GEO Syncom 2, 35 kg, 1963). \n\n With the US and Soviet emphasis on heavier launch vehicles and human explora-\ntion, and a demand for greater capability in remote sensing and communications, the \nfocus of satellite technology shifted to larger platforms. Miniaturization of electronic \nand particularly digital devices requiring less electric power coupled with better bat-\nteries and solar panels and the availability of improved sensors and other payload \nelements by the 1980s enabled useful missions to be achieved in small spacecraft. On \nthe demand side, space budget pressures and a desire on the part of smaller countries, \namateur groups, and universities to gain experience in space combined to reignite \ninterest in small spacecraft. \n\n While it is natural to identify small spacecraft according to their mass, they are \nmore accurately characterized by their complexity and the management structure \nused for their development. As complexity is reduced, both the engineering and the \nmanagement of a spacecraft change. Small satellites are not miniature large satellites, \nany more than a single family home is a small skyscraper. Both are developed accord-\ning to a set of technologies, of management structures, and of skill sets, some of \nwhich are overlapping, but they differ enough that their developers tend to be special-\nized in one or the other, as are the technologies they incorporate, their customer popu-\nlations, and their applications. It is a sign of the maturation of a technology that a \nbroader spectrum of capabilities and choices are made available to a wider spectrum \nof users. In transportation we have shoes, bicycles, motorcycles, a wide range of cars and \nSUVs, vans and small trucks, Semi Tractor Trailers, trains, a range of aircraft ranging \nfrom single seaters to 600 seat transport jets, and boats also ranging from single seat \nkayaks to ocean liners accommodating thousands of passenger and crew. We do not \nassume that the development of a shoe or kayak would be similar, in technology \n\n    Chapter 8   \n\n Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: \nA New Paradigm                  \n\n\n\n248 Space Program Management\n\nor management, to a cruise ship. Similarly space is now characterized by spacecraft \nranging from a few grams to thousands of kilograms, and across this spectrum the \nmethods of management and that which is managed vary radically.  \n\n    8.2.   Theory and Practice \n\n While small spacecraft are known for their low cost, as little as a few hundred dollars, \nand rapid development periods, as short as a month, they also provide capabilities not \npossible with large spacecraft. Examples include swarms and constellations of large \nnumbers of spacecraft, inspection, low earth orbit communications, rapid deployment, \neducation, entertainment, extremely high ?V for interception of other spacecraft or for \nrapid interplanetary rendezvous missions, and expendable missions such as impactors. \nCan one management methodology be applied to the entire range of small missions, \nfrom small academic programs with budgets of a few thousands of dollars to major \nmilitary, civil, and commercial systems costing hundreds of millions of dollars? \n\n Low complexity space programs have been developed since the 1950s. Their man-\nagement structures and methods are well characterized. However, few missions are \nfocused solely on low cost and complexity. Management is adapted from theory to \nthe realities of each mission\u2019s requirements and development environment. However, \nas  fl uid mechanics exploits ideals such as inviscid  fl ow and electrical engineers model \ncomponents as if they were pure resistors or inductors, we start with the management \nof an ideal small space program and then via case studies look at how this model is \nmodulated in real-world situations.  \n\n    8.3.   Scaling Management \n\n Any activity involving more than one person requires a management structure. The \nmore intuitive and ancient is the star structure shown in    Fig.  8.1 .  \n\n The Star management structure is characteristic of small satellite programs. \n Every member communicates with each other, and the manager is in the middle \n\nof, not separated from, the other team members (Fig.  8.2 ).  \n This hierarchical structure is necessary to manage groups of size exceeding the \n\nability of members to interact regularly with every other person. \n Applications of the Star structure include management of a family, of a football \n\nteam on the  fi eld, and of many well-known technological projects including the \ndevelopment of early musical instruments, the telephone, the airplane, and the inter-\ncontinental ballistic missile. In these latter cases the term \u201cskunk works\u201d is used to \nmean a small, highly interactive group of people, whose roles adapt constantly to the \ndemands of the moment, operating without a formal set of rules and procedures. That \nthis environment is highly desirable is evidenced by the popularity and extension of \nthat term even to very large organizations which lack those qualities, though they may \naspire to them. \n\n It is desirable because it is highly ef fi cient. Small groups can accomplish a tremen-\ndous amount with a minimum of management overhead. But why? And what are the \nlimits of small groups? \n\n\n\n249Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\n      Communications \n\n All members of a small group communicate with all others. There is no sectoring of \ninformation. If for example a problem pops up in the attitude control system requiring \nmore power, mass, or dollars, the entire team can focus on its resolution. They have \nthe  fl exibility and authority to trade off a reduction in power budgeted for other sys-\ntems, a reduction in the amount of data that can be processed and transmitted to the \nground, or an increase in ground station antenna diameter, the cost of increased solar \npanel ef fi ciency or size, or simply living with reduced attitude determination or con-\ntrol precision or authority. Further, the team can assess the risk vs. bene fi t of using a \nnew technology which promises to provide the performance required within the \nestablished power (and mass, cost, volume, etc.) budget(s).  \n\n  Figure 8.1.    Star Structure.       \n\n  Figure 8.2.    Hierarchical Structure.       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n250 Space Program Management\n\n      Roles \n\n In the above example, the small interactive group can also redirect human resources. \nAn engineer working on mechanical design or the communications system who is \nprogressing more rapidly may temporarily help out in resolving problems in the ACS. \nThe entire team can be brought together to brainstorm, and with all of the subsystems \nrepresented rapidly tradeoff the pros and cons of potential solutions.  \n\n      Standards \n\n In classic larger space systems we are accustomed to standards such as the manda-\ntory use of space quali fi ed components, to components with heritage in space, to \nspeci fi c assembly processes, test standards, materials, documentation, reporting, \nreviewing, and so on. The small team relies instead on the judgment of the members. \nThe quarterback does not always pass the ball or hand it off or plunge into the defen-\nsive line. If an opportunity arises, that role may change suddenly to that of the offen-\nsive end to exploit the opportunity for a long run along the sidelines. A huddle may \nbe skipped to save time. A small team can assess the risk of use of a nonquali fi ed \ncomponent compared with the advantages of reduced power, reduced parts count, \nreduced cost, mass, complexity, across all of the spacecraft systems, environments, \nand requirements, in a way that is impossible in enormous systems built by hundreds \nor thousands of people.  \n\n      Jazz Ensemble \n\n The fact that small systems operate more like a jazz ensemble than a symphony orches-\ntra has made dif fi cult, if not impossible, the initiative to write a \u201cmil-spec\u201d for the \ndevelopment of small, low-cost space systems. They by their nature do not follow a \nscript, a musical score, but that a small team would make all of its own decisions with-\nout reference to rules borne of 60+ years of space experience seems like an invitation \nto repeat the failures of the past.  \n\n      Staff \n\n The organization of a small satellite team is tailored to its population. Even if there \nwere a handbook of procedures to follow, parts selection criteria to be applied, suc-\ncess depends on people, on their experience, on their focus and commitment to qual-\nity, on their ability to communicate what they are doing and why, and especially to \ntalk about their errors and failures of parts and architectural elements, to the rest of \nthe group.  \n\n      Commitment \n\n In a sports team, a family and a small project, whether it is the church picnic or a \nsmall satellite, there is a level of personal commitment which energizes the group. \nThese are not bureaucracies where the performers are hidden behind boxes on orga-\nnizational charts. Small team members feel, and in fact are, closely identi fi ed with \n\n\n\n251Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\nthe outcome. This stimulant has to be exploited carefully. The management \nproblem switches from motivation of the staff to work to instead curbing their ten-\ndency to overwork, to take over too much of the problem, which can lead to over-\nwhelming pressure, major delays, and ultimately burnout and the exit of a key \nplayer from the team.  \n\n      Global Sharing \n\n Despite the necessity to keep the team size small, to enable the rich network of cross \ncommunication necessary to achieve global sharing of information and optimization \nof resources, the manager needs to force additional staff into the team structure and \nnot late in the program, after the team is overwhelmed, the design story is too com-\nplex and the staff too exhausted to educate a newcomer. All jobs are bigger than they \nseem at the outcome, thus overstaf fi ng by 25% is absolutely required, as is stripping \nevery possible requirement on the system not absolutely essential to the fundamental \nmission.  \n\n      Requirements \n\n Large programs are large because they are complex. They perform many functions \nfor a variety of constituencies. GPS provides navigation, position and time infor-\nmation, as well as various associated communications and other services, to a \nglobal civil, military, and commercial user base. By contrast, a small satellite may \ndo one very simple mission for one very small group of clients. The CRO system \nbuilt by DSI in the 1990s did one such mission. In a mission lasting just a few days, \nit made its position known via optical sensing and on a single command expelled \nits payload of a single liquid chemical into space, for observation by a few scien-\ntists interested in the behavior of those materials when exposed to the space \nenvironment.  \n\n      Micro-engineering \n\n Micro spacecraft must have a very tight mission focus to remain small. The satisfac-\ntion of a larger community is accomplished through a multiplicity of small spacecraft \nprograms, not through the imposition of multiple requirements on a single system and \ndevelopment team. The offense of a football team has the single goal of moving the \nball over the opponent\u2019s goal line, and failing that to kick it over the goal post. It is \nwell understood and readily shared among the team members, and progress toward \nthat goal is obvious to all the team members at every moment during the activity. \nNone of which is true, for instance, of a gate agent at an international airline, who \nmay be optimizing the check-in of passengers to a single aircraft, but has no clear \nunderstanding even of the dynamics of that one  fl ight, let alone how that  fl ight\u2019s \nperformance meshes with the  fl eet\u2019s operations of the day, with  fl ight safety, with the \nairline\u2019s annual economic performance. The complex requirements of that large orga-\nnization force management to focus individual workers on accomplishment of local, \nrather than global, objectives.   \n\n\n\n252 Space Program Management\n\n    8.4.   When Complexity Exceeds the Small Team Capability \n\n Too often during the rebirth of microspace in the last 30 years, well-meaning sponsors \nhave attempted to overreach the abilities of the small organization. A skunk works \nmay turn out a new tablet computer with remarkable speed and cost ef fi ciency, but \nthat model cannot be extended to the production, distribution, marketing, sales, ser-\nvice, and customer support required when millions of that device are put in the hands \nof consumers around the world. Job One as a microspace program manager is to make \nsure the program you are managing is, and remains, possible for a small team of \nhighly cross-linked individuals. And defending that structure is an ongoing challenge, \nas requirements for the mission tend to grow with time, as do the peripheral demands \non the limited time and energy available from a small group of people. \n\n Asked by the customer to accept a larger budget in exchange for more results, \nwhich may take the form of a more capable space system, or higher quality/space \nquali fi ed components, or more frequent, more thorough reviews, or even a more \nhighly redundant architecture, it is the manager\u2019s job to say no. It is counter intuitive that \nthe addition of resources can destroy the project. But the choice is to keep the pro-\ngram within the small project envelop, or to change its nature to that of a large pro-\ngram, with formal division of responsibilities, formal lines of communication among \nspecialist groups, formal requirements for components, procedures, assembly meth-\nods, test, every aspect of the product\u2019s evolution. But rarely, maybe never, does the \nclient realize how large the budget impact is of this transition. It may be a factor of \n10 or 100, but certainly not of 2 or 4. And it is the very rare case that a client is \ncapable of a 100-fold increase in the funds available for a project. Thus those projects \nthat fail to stay in that small project envelope face one of two outcomes: either the \nspacecraft is somehow completed and launched but fails on orbit (NASA\u2019s Lewis \nprogram) (see in particular   http://spacese.spacegrant.org/Failure%20Reports/Lewis_\nMIB_2-98.pdf     \u201cFactors indirectly Contributing to Failure\u201d which emphasizes the \nmismatch of team size and hence capability to the increase in requirements imposed \nupon it); or the program is cancelled (NASA\u2019s Clarke mission) (see  Science  16 \nJanuary 1998, Vol. 279 no. 5349 p. 318 \u201cGoldin May Cancel NASA Earth Probe\u201d \nwhich explains how as requirements grew and the small development team grew to \naccommodate them, costs accelerated well beyond forecast or budget realities for the \nmission). \n\n Counter to intuition, the refusal of increased resources is the primary management \ntool for ensuring program success.  \n\n    8.5.   Staf fi ng the Small Space Project \n\n Too often the realization that success depends on individuals more than on formal \nstandards has led to an \u201cA-team\u201d strategy, assembly of a team composed entirely of \nexperienced veterans with a track record. This is impossible, since there are not so \nmany of those people available and they often do not want to be immersed in the \nday-to-day details of yet another microsatellite\u2019s evolution. The A-team is also unde-\nsirable. As in the cockpit of a jet liner, a mixture of more senior staff with the judg-\nment borne of experience combined with others less experienced but possibly more \n\nhttp://spacese.spacegrant.org/Failure%20Reports/Lewis_MIB_2-98.pdf\nhttp://spacese.spacegrant.org/Failure%20Reports/Lewis_MIB_2-98.pdf\n\n\n253Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\nadroit with modern design tools and more interested in day-to-day assembly and test \nactivities is essential. It is this diversity of experience, ability, inclination, and point \nof view which is to a small program what all of the formal requirements, procedures, \ndocumentation, and standards are to a large mission. \n\n This emphasis on staff is anathema to larger programs and is a major obstacle to \nthe microspace program manager who will be under pressure to depersonalize the \nprogram so to avoid dependence on individual members of the team. This insurance \ncomes at a high    cost, diverting the team\u2019s time and energy into creation of documen-\ntation meant to explain to a person not now present what they did, will do, and why. \nAn exercise that even in large programs proves at best marginally effective, the idea \nthat a satellite could be created by a newcomer out of a cook book, much less one \nwritten by professional engineers who are not professional writers, and who them-\nselves have yet to verify that their methods and designs will work being fundamen-\ntally  fl awed (see below). \n\n The methods to protect from staf fi ng changes in smaller programs are different. \nFirst, the chances of a team member exiting are less simply because the development \nprogram is shorter, typically a year or less. Compared with a major spacecraft pro-\ngram which may last 10, 15, or 20 years, in which staff turnover is inevitable, it is \nrare in a microspace program. Major programs are managed by division into thou-\nsands of individual tasks each one performed by an individual or group without need \nof contact with those performing other tasks. By contrast, in a small program ideally \nevery team member has some contract with every task. The radio engineer is expected \nto help out in the power system even in the deployment mechanism used for a solar \npanel\u2014maybe it could also deploy her antennas. There is a naturally existing buddy \nsystem. In an emergency that RF engineer could stand in for the power systems lead, \nat least until a new staff member can be added to the team, whom the RF engineer \nwould then help to understand the work done so far. \n\n It is the manager\u2019s job to make sure that this buddy system is in place for every \nelement of the program. Engineers, especially software developers, have a tendency \nto simplify their work by not sharing it and thus saving the overhead of communica-\ntion with others, and of adjusting to another\u2019s work habits. This behavior is not toler-\nable for many reasons. The loss of that person would in fact be a major setback to the \nprogram. There is no control on the quality of the work that person does, if no one \nelse is involved in it. And if the job turns out to be more complex than anticipated, \nalmost always the case with software development, there is no way other staff can \nhelp out, which is a fundamental mechanism of integrated team effectiveness. \n\n A worker who cannot be trusted to function openly and actively with others must \nbe eliminated from the team. Unlike management of large organizations and pro-\ngrams, which simply by virtue of their size must have among them a wide variety of \nworkers and styles, the small team is hand-picked to have members with special \nqualities, among them close cooperation. There are no stars without whom victory is \nimpossible, no A-teams of all elite workers with vast experience, no lone rangers who \npromise perfect on time work if and only if they are left alone for months, and there \nare no special cases. \n\n There is one area where the manager should eliminate the buddy system, and that \nis in travel and meetings off site. Rarely is more than one person necessary for those \nmeetings. The argument will be made that the expertise shared among multiple \n\n\n\n254 Space Program Management\n\npeople is necessary for the meeting. The failure of a meeting is less important than \nthe failure of a spacecraft because the engineers were busy making meetings success-\nful. One person goes, and the others are available for consultations by telephone if \nnecessary, which usually they won\u2019t be.  \n\n    8.6.   How Small Teams Function to Reduce Cost \n\n The small team reduces resource requirements\u2014both time and money\u2014in many \nways. This is both a bene fi t and a trap. A program budgeted assuming it will be \naccomplished by a small team will be impossible to do via a more classically struc-\ntured approach with work divided into individual independent packages and divided \namong groups which do not communicate and cooperate closely with one another. \nThe program manager is thus committed to maintaining the small team structure, \nthere is no other way the program can survive. \n\n      Flexible Requirements \n\n The team must include the client because to reach the lowest cost overall solution, \nevery element of the design must be in some sense negotiable. If the cost to further \nincrease    electrical power is large, say because to produce more power a deployed \nsolar array will be necessary, all members of the team will look for power savings, \nmaybe in the processor design, in the radio link, or in the operations of the payload \nprovided by the client. There is no requirement not subject to renegotiation except \nthat the team size is not allowed to grow and thus that the program and mission \nsucceed.  \n\n      Avoid Insurance \n\n The classical space program budgets for mission assurance even in ways, like \nextensive documentation, which are of limited ef fi cacy, because with the large \namount of money and years of development at stake, the high visibility of major \nprograms, and given that they have already committed to a readily scalable, albeit \ninef fi cient bureaucratic management structure because the small, cross-linked team \ncannot possibly achieve a program of their scope, the investment might be justi fi ed \ndespite its cost and limitations. A small program must by contrast avoid documenta-\ntion whenever possible, because the fundamental key to success is to limit the \namount of work the small team must do. If the team is overwhelmed, quality will \nsuffer, people will have to be added, and the management structure is destroyed. \nThe program will fail or its cost and schedule will grow to the point of triggering \nthe program\u2019s cancellation. Comparing this certainty with the tenacious hope that \ndocumentation rather than the buddy system of direct personal contact will make up \nfor the loss of a key team member, it should be clear that wasting team member\u2019s \ntime in documentation is to be avoided (documentation for small programs is \ndiscussed below).  \n\n\n\n255Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\n      Analysis \n\n Most of the engineering analysis necessary for physically large spacecraft is unneces-\nsary for small ones. Structures are often much stronger than necessary simply to use \nmaterials thicknesses which can be handled and attached to each other easily, obviat-\ning the need for all but an executive level strength analysis. A relatively heavy struc-\nture, usually of aluminum, of small dimension cannot support large thermal gradients; \nhence also the thermal analysis is reduced in most cases to a one-dimensional heat \nbalance calculation. The team should be designing, building, integrating, and testing, \nnot sitting in front of computers simulating, calculating, analyzing. The team is small, \nand there is not room for nonproductive activity to make us feel that failures won\u2019t \nhappen. The system is simple\u2014build it and test it. Ninety-nine percent of the time it \nwill work  fi ne and the other 1% would have probably been missed in analysis any-\nway. Worse yet, analysis will \u201c fi nd\u201d problems that will not exist in the actual hard-\nware, further wasting resources solving nonproblems.  \n\n      CAD \n\n Even more than  fi nite element tools, engineers love CAD. It is wonderful to sit in \nfront of a big hi-res screen and bring a perfect design to life while listening to music \non the ipad. But not at work on a small satellite, whose structure is simple enough \nthat at most a limited amount of CAD work is necessary. It should be designed mostly \nthrough hand sketches and conversations with the fabricators, who ideally should be \nthe engineers themselves. Do not design it, just build it. If it gets built wrong, the \ninvestment is minimum, education maximum, and the second build will be perfect, \nturnaround time minimal.  \n\n      Meetings \n\n This is a team of people who work together constantly all day long. The entire project \nis a meeting. Larger programs meet for periodic reviews, the PDR and CDR, for \nexample, which are an exercise in hiding from the reviewers any possible problem in \nthe design, while the reviewers, faced with the impossible task of understanding and \n fi nding errors in designs barely understood by the people who have spent many \nmonths in their creation, justi fi es their role by creating action item lists the team must \nsubsequently ful fi ll instead of building the spacecraft. \n\n There are only two types of meetings necessary in a small team:\n\n    1.    Internal regular (weekly) meetings to keep track of outstanding, unresolved prob-\nlems. The team leader should maintain a list of these, and it will likely become \nvery large, ranked according to their urgency, with dates by which they must be \nresolved and the person responsible for their resolution. These regular meetings \nshould also serve as a reminder to the team to resolve these issues before they stall \nprogress.  \n\n    2.    Technical Interface Meetings (TIMs): Instead of formal reviews, groups involved \nin each subsystem should meet informally with outside experts in those areas, to go \nover across a table the details of the design the assumptions inherent in it, concerns \n\n\n\n256 Space Program Management\n\nand problems. The focus is on  fi nding, not covering over, weak points and errors, \nwithout negative consequences instead with the goal of resolving them to the maxi-\nmum extent possible during the meeting and without further analysis      \n\n      Communications (Phone, Email, SMS, Etc.) \n\n We live in an era of extreme communications overhead. The members of the team can \nexpend a lot of time communicating with the outside world, particularly with the \ncustomer who will doubtless have each person\u2019s cell phone number for calls and SMS \nmessages, and email address for more complex questions. The manager must set out \nfrom the beginning and maintain the discipline that absolutely no communications \nare permitted with the team except as triaged  fi rst by that manager. The manager\u2019s job \nis to protect the team from a stream which is in fact a deluge of questions, comments, \nopinions, and suggestions often offered with good intentions, by outsiders. Every \nteam and manager must manage communications in the way that works for them, \nsince email is a useful tool as much as it is a time sink. The most effective and least \nconstraining method is to make clear from Day 1 that under no circumstances should \nemail be exchanged with the customer without  fi rst channeling through the manager. \nRemind the team of this rule and emphasize why. Look for cheating and bring it up \nprivately and publicly. Make it a campaign that you must be the sole point of contact \nand that you rely on the team to enforce that rule for and with you. \n\n The largest communication overhead is usually created by the team\u2019s members \nand management. It is too easy to blame the customer, but there is a lot of chatter \ngenerated within the team. Discourage email discourse and encourage people to talk. \nEmail is a waste of time spent typing, and worse, it leads to numerous misunderstand-\nings, both interpersonal and technical, which then must be unknotted through man-\nagement intervention and in-person conversations, all of which would be avoided by \nsimply talking face to face or by telephone. It is incumbent upon management to \npreach and practice the avoidance of email whenever possible.  \n\n      Documentation \n\n To the maximum extent possible, the only documentation should be that which is \nproduced naturally in the course of doing the engineering of the small spacecraft. \n\n This \u201cfree\u201d documentation includes:\n\n   The contract including a mission\u2019s requirements document, and all associated \u2022 \nmodi fi cations, invoices, and other contractual communications.  \n  An archive of all designs including all changes/modi fi cations.  \u2022 \n  An archive of all analyses including spreadsheets, Matlab models, etc.  \u2022 \n  Budgets: parts lists, mass, power, thermal budgets.  \u2022 \n  A photo archive of every minute element of the spacecraft at many stages along \u2022 \nits development path. Also photos of every test setup, every time the spacecraft is \npackaged, etc.  \n  Videos narrated by an engineer or the manager of procedures, for instance the \u2022 \nintegration of the solar panels or payload to the bus.  \n  All emails.  \u2022 \n\n\n\n257Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\n  All test plans and records.  \u2022 \n  All failures encountered in the development process should be documented and \u2022 \nentered in the archives usually organized by the worker or the subsystem \ninvolved.    \n\n These may be simply a failure of an ordered part, a DC/DC converter, or of a \ncircuit and the changes made to improve the circuit.\n\n   Acceptance test records.  \u2022 \n  Software: It is imperative that software be developed according to an agreed stan-\u2022 \ndard created and enforced by one of the engineers or the manager. The software \nmust be thoroughly commented in detail so that to the maximum extent possible a \nperson other than the author can understand the function of each line of code. \nVariable naming standards should be uniform across the program.  \n  All planning documents created by management. Most important among these are \u2022 \nthe outstanding issues list ranked per urgency, updated at least weekly and distrib-\nuted to the team, and informal records of all conversations with the customer, \nparticularly affecting the execution of the program\u2014certainly requirements but \nalso the details of who will do what action items by what date.  \n  Routinely produced management documents include cost and hours budgets, \u2022 \nschedules, document trees, points of contact and the contract and contract \nmodi fi cations.  \n  All certi fi cations, applications and other forms (e.g., for spectrum allocation).  \u2022 \n  All  fi nancial documentation including purchases including vendor data sheets.    \u2022 \n\n Simply archiving and organizing this documentation\u2014all of which is produced \nautomatically in the course of the program\u2014provide a highly useful record of what \nwas done during the program and what the product is that was produced. It is already \nmore than will ever be read    though it is almost always the case that buried among all \nthe photos, videos and design and analysis records there will be information key to \nthe success of the program. Capturing, organizing, and archiving all    these multimedia \ndata are some of the tasks that can and thus should be of fl oaded to a person other than \nthe members of the development team. \n\n Some formal documentation is necessary. The most important is the Interface \nControl Document (ICD) to ensure that responsibility for every element of the pro-\ngram is assigned to someone or some entity and associated with a delivery date. The \ncreation, maintenance, and communication of the ICD are critical jobs of the pro-\ngram\u2019s management.   \n\n    8.7.   The Integrated Team \n\n We live in a society of mass production of products at minimum cost (automobiles, \ncomputers, cell phones, Ikea furniture) and many of our notions on how work is done \nare affected by that pervasive environment, which is NOT characteristic of the mic-\nrosatellite development arena which is most often characterized by a small team \ncharged with building a one of a kind custom device of high quality and reliability. \nThus it is important to review with the team how the work is done in an integrated \nproduct team environment. \n\n\n\n258 Space Program Management\n\n The fundamental de fi ning quality of this team structure is that we do it all and we \nlive with the product from \u201ccradle to grave\u201d or in this case, concept to orbit. The team \nshould not be confronted with speci fi cations sheets, detailed budgets, and schedules, \nand then asked to magically satisfy all these requirements with limited time, dollars, \nand personnel resources. The program begins in a discussion of what the client wants \nout of their mission. Not specs, outcomes. The team is the systems engineering \nexpert, and they are the appropriate group to translate the customer\u2019s operational \nconcept into a systems design including for example the orbit, the attitude control \nperformance, the modes of communications, and on-orbit operations. \n\n The same team that has identi fi ed these top level design elements then translates \nthem into the increasingly detailed levels of design. There is no handing off from a \ncustomer engineering group to a contractor systems engineering group to a detailed \ndesign team to fabrication to test to integration, to launch ops and to operations. All \nof these functions are carried out by the same people who live with the program from \nbefore its inception through the accomplishment of the mission on orbit. Certainly \nthere will be outsiders involved during various phases\u2014specialists at test facilities, \nfor example. But the responsibility for the execution is always with the team, and they \nmust be present always with the hardware. Routine operations may be carried out by \nthe client organization, but the team must remain a part of that team. \n\n In all cases the rule is to avoid a situation in which the team is confronted with a \nproblem resulting from something done to the system that the team was not aware of \nwhen it was done. This situation then requires the reconstruction of past events which \nis in practice impossible. Given that the team cannot monitor every command sent to \nthe satellite over its on-orbit lifetime, the customer may be provided with operations \nsoftware consisting of canned, pretested command modules which can be selected but \nnot modi fi ed, which have been tested and proven reliable and not damaging. If the \ncustomer wants to do something beyond this vocabulary, the development team must \nbe brought together to  fi gure out how to accomplish this new capability. \n\n The team members will perform their own shopping, and when desired parts are \nno longer available, they are individually responsible for  fi nding substitutes and mak-\ning required modi fi cations to the design. They should be able to buy those parts on \nthe phone or online with a credit card. There is no purchasing department, and the \nresponsibility for receiving the parts and acceptance testing is with the engineer who \nordered them. \n\n There is no quality or reliability organization. These elements are built in, follow-\ning the example of the team manager, to the way the team works. For instance, prob-\nlems with functionality, a device which works sometimes but not always, as an \nexample, must be discussed at least with the buddy and the manager, if not with the \nentire group. Failures of components must be documented. Quality cannot be imposed \non a group by an external manager, nor subcontracted. It must be made the job of each \nteam member. Similarly reliability is the result of a discussion among all members of \nthe team of the failure modes, weak links of the operational chain, and tradeoffs on \nhow to harden the design. \n\n The cradle to grave strategy  fi ts the small program because it eliminates the \ninef fi ciencies and errors inherent in handing hardware, software, and other design \ndata off from one group    to the next to the next. It eliminates the conversations \nbetween the buyer armed only with a parts list who has to refer back to the engineer \n\n\n\n259Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\nwhen a component is found to be no longer available. Engineers will complain that \ntheir time is being wasted in purchasing, and they are right. But globally time is saved \nthrough elimination of the buyer and the iterative buying process, and less obviously \nthrough working directly with suppliers, the engineer often  fi nds new components, \nnew ways of doing things, that a buyer would not have been able to leverage.  \n\n    8.8.   Parts Selection \n\n A partial truth about small programs is that they use commercial off-the-shelf \u201cRadio \nShack\u201d parts. The probability of the failure of one part within a system is calculated \nby the reliability of each part multiplied by the reliability of each other part. Each of \nthese numbers is almost, but not quite, one, and as you multiply them together the \nresulting reliability falls rapidly (Fig.  8.3 ).  \n\n As the number of parts increases, for any given parts reliability, the overall reli-\nability falls. Systems with fewer parts can use lower reliability parts and still achieve \nhigher overall reliability, explaining why consumer electronics built with low quality \nparts, even when used in the stressing environments of the automobile, kitchen, and \nbeach, nonetheless are more reliable than spacecraft. \n\n Parts count varies directly with overall mass, and a spacecraft of 10 kg will have \n1,000 times fewer parts than a spacecraft of 10,000 kg. Thus while a reliability of \n0.9999 may be more than suf fi cient for the small spacecraft, no existing level of parts \nreliability is suf fi ciently high to assure there will be no failures in the bigger satellite. \nThus it is logical that larger missions use the highest reliability parts available, and \ncompliment their use with extensive redundancy in their design and in critical sys-\ntems triple and quadruple redundancy. These measures have the opposite result in \nsmall systems. By complicating the design, raising complexity and workload, they \nstress the small team and waste resources that are then not available for engineering, \nbuilding, and testing, and ultimately decrease mission reliability. \n\n  Figure 8.3.     Reliability of Parts Ensembles.       \n\n \n\n\n\n260 Space Program Management\n\n Many terrestrial parts have very high reliability and particularly parts built for \nother stressful applications such as automotive use are quite suitable for spacecraft \nuse. The small team is well positioned to take advantage of these parts because the \nengineer considering the use of a nonstandard part can check with all the other \nteam members to rapidly discover any potential risks that part\u2019s use might carry \nwith it. That person can then research the construction methods and materials and \napplications history of the part and carry on any additional tests necessary to \nqualify the part for use. On a large program this rapid communication across all \nprogram disciplines is impossible and no one engineer can understand the range of \nenvironmental requirements applicable to each component, implying that it is \nnecessary to select parts from a predetermined list or list of standards that is uni-\nform across the program, despite the costs, both in dollars and in complexity, that \nmay entail. \n\n The work of McDermott et al. (\u201cAutomotive Electronics in Space, Combining the \nadvantages of high reliability components with high production volume\u201d 0-7803-\n7231-X/01/$10.00/\u00a9 2002 IEEE) describes the use of terrestrial products for space \napplication in detail. They highlight that there is a cost in time and testing to use \nthese parts in space, so it is reasonable to ask if it is worth the trouble. Often it is \nbecause a single highly capable component found outside the space world, where \nheritage parts tend to be of previous generations, can replace an entire circuit board \nof older parts, reducing parts count which raises reliability per the above chart. Every \npart eliminated is a part which cannot fail. Highly integrated parts also eliminate \ncomplexity\u2014or at least subsume it inside the part so that the team does not have to \ndeal with it explicitly\u2014and thus further contribute to reliability. By reducing mass \nand power consumption, these parts reduce the size, cost complexity, and risk associ-\nated with all the other spacecraft systems. \n\n This largely technical consideration has an important impact on program manage-\nment. The small program manager cannot accept requirements usually inserted in \ncontracts to restrict the team to certain, often heritage or approved, parts, or parts that \nmeet a certain mil-spec. This type of spec is representative of the rigidity necessary \nfor product assurance in large programs and inappropriately applied to small ones. \nThe avoidance of rigid standards allows for a different means of achieving mission \nsuccess based on global, not local, reliability optimization.  \n\n    8.9.   Testing \n\n Most of reliability is the result not of these considerations and conversations, but of \ntesting. It is the manager\u2019s job to push the program through development quickly and \ninexpensively to reach integration and test with ample time and  fi nancial resources \navailable for a long and thorough test program. \n\n The manager will realize often that by slowing down the development process \na more accurate design can result, with better analytical backup. But the counter \nargument, stated simply, is that an hour of testing is worth more than a week of \nspeculating (analysis). Conventional large spacecraft programs are not cost con-\nstrained, they are requirements constrained. The contract and development stan-\ndards dictate that the design must be reviewed and approved multiple times, \n\n\n\n261Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\nensuring (one hopes) that a very thorough design and analysis process has been \nfollowed. And it speci fi es the analyses that shall be performed. The cost will \nincrease to accomplish those requirements, and if it cannot, the program is not \nviable. \n\n By contrast, a small space program is cost constrained, even if the customer offers \nto pay for overruns, because the team size is strictly limited as is the time it can be \nreliably kept together, as are the skills available within it. Outside help by analysts \nwhich appears a free resource is the opposite. The analyst must be made familiar with \nthe design and with the details that make it up, and with what can be changed and not \nchanged. If the analytical results point to problems, and they usually do, the team will \nhave to refute those results through analysis and or test, or initiate changes that may \nultimately have proved unnecessary. The program pace is slowed and though bureau-\ncratically the team size is maintained, in fact the number of interfaces, of discussions, \nof meetings, is greatly increased. \n\n In the cost-constrained mission, a dollar spent here is not available there. It is hard \nto argue against more analysis, better parts, and increased subsystem testing, except \nthat each must be seen in the light of what won\u2019t get done because of the resources it \nexpends. The only way to know a spacecraft works is to build it and test it. In a major \nprogram the cost of  fi xing an error is unacceptable, so analysis and subsystem testing \nmust be thorough. In a small satellite, even very fundamental changes can be effected \nrelatively quickly. Thus the risk balance switches toward building more quickly and \ninstead testing more thoroughly. \n\n      The Thousand Hour Test \n\n With the possible exception of missions lasting a few hours or days, the space-\ncraft must be shown to operate independently for 1,000 h without external inter-\nvention. Demonstrating this will take many more than 1,000 h, given that the \nsystem will doubtless fail this test several times. Better to fail that test in the lab \nthan on-orbit, but as 1,000 h equates to over a month, the schedule must be built \nand enforced to maintain an interval of many months for integration and test. \nMore time consuming than the 1,000 h test is the integration phase which pro-\nceeds it, probably the most frequently underestimated element of every space \nmission. \n\n While the 1,000 h test is inevitably time consuming and expensive, there are com-\npensating savings. Do not waste money simulating in elaborate test  fi xtures the on-\norbit environment. Test the thermal model, not the thermal behavior on orbit. If the \nactual spacecraft behaves exactly per its model in any vaguely representative (i.e., \nvacuum) environment, it will predict the on-orbit behavior well enough. In many very \nsmall programs, the only thermal vacuum chamber is a bell jar, and in AMSAT for \ndecades the only vibration testing was done with spacecraft bolted to bumpers of four \nwheel drive vehicles driven off road to shake up the hardware and see if it survived. \nWhile it is probably for the best that technique has been eclipsed, it is also true that \nin those years AMSAT spacecrafts were achieving better than 95% reliability, at least \ndouble that of the professional large spacecraft industry.  \n\n\n\n262 Space Program Management\n\n      Parking Lot Orbit Test \n\n Software is only one victim of the conventional development simulation syndrome \nwhere typically the spacecraft is tested in a sun simulating chamber\u2014a vacuum \nchamber illuminated arti fi cially with a light spectrum, direction, and intensity quite \nsimilar to that encountered on orbit. By contrast one of the most effective tests of a \nsmall spacecraft is to place it on a lab test cart with four wheels and, on a sunny day, \nroll it out into the parking lot where it must operate completely autonomously, charg-\ning its own batteries from the available sun, albeit  fi ltered through earth\u2019s atmosphere, \ncommunicating via its radio receiver and transmitter and maintaining a sort of ther-\nmal equilibrium notwithstanding that it is not in space vacuum. Again we are testing \nthe model. A calculation can be made of how much power the satellite should be \nproducing for charging and operations in earth sun vs. space sun. If the actual hard-\nware performs very close to that model, it is likely to also perform in space according \nto that model with the space insulation levels plugged into the model. \n\n Small satellites do not employ major ground stations\u2014typically the ground station \nis developed along with the satellite, based on off-the-shelf transmitters and receivers \nand a laptop computer controller. The spacecraft is thus tested and diagnosed not \nfrom a simulator, but from its actual ground station, zeroing the cost of a ground sta-\ntion simulator, another source of errors, particularly the ones that are often not dis-\ncovered until the satellite is on orbit. The development team may complain that the \nserial (RF) interface to the spacecraft is not suf fi cient to do diagnostics, the response \nto which is the question \u201cif it isn\u2019t adequate, how will the spacecraft be diagnosed if \nthere are problems on orbit?\u201d: The ground station and spacecraft will be evolved to \nwork around that problem and it will not turn up on orbit. In addition, by the time the \nspacecraft is launched, its team will have thousands of hours of experience operating \nit in its true  fl ight environment. Reality is always the best simulation. \n\n Another savings is in not environmentally testing every subsystem of the small \nspacecraft. The entire spacecraft is smaller and less complex than the subsystems \ntypically tested individually before integration of a major spacecraft.  \n\n      Avoid Simulation \n\n Conventional systems built with expensive space quali fi ed parts rely heavily on simu-\nlation particularly for software development. It is neither practical nor affordable to \nprovide every software developer  fl ight hardware as a development and test platform, \nso money is spent on simulation hardware and software which unfortunately is at best \na distorted model of  fl ight hardware and software realities. After paying for the simu-\nlation hardware and software, and for the time spent to assemble, debug, and under-\nstand them and their special development environment, more time is spent \ntransitioning \u201c fi nal\u201d software that ran on the simulator to the  fl ight hardware, where \nit will have bugs. And since there is one or at most two  fl ight hardware systems, the \nsoftware development process regardless of the number of developers becomes sin-\ngularly serial, and the entire program will spend money awaiting the completion of \nthis critical phase, sometimes for many months. \n\n Small spacecrafts built with commercial components have very low parts costs and \nhence can afford an to provide every developer an exact replica of the  fl ight system, \n\n\n\n263Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\neliminating the need for development and understanding of a simulation system, \nand the second phase of debugging of the transition to  fl ight hardware.   \n\n    8.10.   Integration \n\n Even very simple spacecraft programs spend much more than 1,000 h in the attempt \nto make a working system out of individual elements which all seemed to work  fi ne \nbefore they were integrated. The length of this interval of intense work and frustration \nis inevitably underestimated by engineers, managers, and the client hoping to save \ntime and money. In theory, expressed in the euphemism of the \u201csuccess oriented pro-\ngram plan\u201d the time to debug the newly integrated system is zero. It more typically \nis, like the roots of a tree, about equal in extent to the other more visible parts of the \nprogram. It is the rare program that has not needed much more time than budgeted to \nintegrate the components and get the system working.\n\n   Parts  fi nding, ordering, and paying  \u2022 \n  From customer concept (pre-specs) through on orbit launch  \u2022 \n  Quality\u2014a standard in common, neither imposed nor subcontracted  \u2022 \n  Reliability: No reliability or quality engineer (no voltage or solder engineer)     \u2022 \n\n    8.11.   Elements of the Small Program Plan \n\n Managing a small team in many ways parallels building a small spacecraft in that the tradi-\ntional complex tools developed for larger systems are unnecessary. While it is not useful to \ndraw an organizational chart for six or ten people, there are management tools which should \nbe employed to maximize the ef fi cient use of the scarce resources available. \n\n However, the most important principle characteristic of management of this class \nof programs is management from within, not from above. Managing an army of 100, \n1,000, or more professionals in a traditional program requires a hierarchical system \nlayering management layers to spread the reach of management eventually to each \nworker. By contrast, the small program manager is more similar to a nurse managing \nthe care of a patient (the satellite) whose treatments will be performed by a small \ngroup of people\u2014a couple of physician specialists, a physical therapist, a nutritionist, \nanother nurse, some people who administer various tests representing the laboratory \nfunctions. The nurse\u2019s job is to work hands-on with the patient to ensure no element \nof the care is accidentally omitted, to ensure they do not all try to happen at the same \ntime, to monitor their quality, to keep the process moving, to chart all that is done \nwith the patient, and to interface with the patient and the patient\u2019s family (the clients) \non progress. The nurse also shields the patient, sometimes even from the family, \nsometimes from caregivers who want to do more than may be called for, the nurse \noften provides documentation for insurance coverage and other bureaucratic necessi-\nties, and in general responds to whatever needs arise to achieve the desired outcome. \nThe nurse is a team member who works shoulder to shoulder with all the caregivers \nand other concerned parties who is different only in that he or she has responsibility \nfor the overall outcome and hence for the negotiation among all of the competing \ninterests and activities effecting the patient. \n\n\n\n264 Space Program Management\n\n To extend the metaphor, the nurse does not generally require an organizational \nchart; however, there is a care plan\u2014what tests will be done, what treatments are to be \napplied in what doses and at what times, what is the appropriate environment for all \nof the required activities. When will the patient go to X-ray, to physical therapy, etc. \n\n In our vocabulary this organization of tasks is the program plan. An example for \na small spacecraft development will closely resemble this template (Fig.  8.4 ).  \n\n The plan assumes a program duration of 21 months from kickoff to launch. But \nthe kickoff itself is assumed 2 months before there is a clear de fi nition of require-\nments or of the speci fi cations of the payload. Small missions do not begin with  fi xed \nrequirements\u2014they begin with a mission and the spacecraft engineering team works \nwith the user to  fi gure out how to meet the overall objectives in the simplest, most \ncost-effective way. Users cannot be expected to understand what functions might be \nmore easily provided and which are more stressing. An example is the difference \nbetween attitude control and attitude knowledge. Tight control is more complex, \nheavier, and more costly than coarser control but highly accurate determination of the \nspacecraft attitude. These 2 months are the most important in the program and should \nnot be omitted. They are where the experience of the team is challenged by the mis-\nsion\u2019s requirements, where there is an opportunity to create an effective architecture \nthat gives the client the desired result using a system that is simple, reliable, afford-\nable, and buildable by a small team. \n\n At the end of this phase of architectural concept development followed by creation \nspacecraft and payload speci fi cations, the cost of the program will be to a large extent \ndetermined. Small satellite technology consists of  fi nding ways to meet top level \nrequirements using very small, simple systems, which is the goal of this phase, and \nthen the ways in which those systems are realized. If a complex system with demand-\ning requirements is the result of this period in which all stakeholders work together \nto develop a low complexity solution, the subsequent development program cannot \nbe made small, rapid, and low cost. \n\n We have seen how the attempt to create complex spacecraft using smaller mission \nmethods led to the failures of the Lewis and Clarke NASA missions, either a technical \nfailure on orbit, or a failure of the program to be executed near to the budget forecast \nand available. The same explanation might apply to AMSAT\u2019s OSCAR 40 space-\ncraft, which was at the time the most ambitious project ever undertaken by the orga-\nnization, requiring 7 years and $4.5 million to realize. After 40 years of success \nbuilding and launching smaller spacecraft, this attempt to realize a much more \ncapable spacecraft on orbit, despite that it bene fi tted from a much larger budget, a \nlarger more experienced development team, and a longer development schedule, \nresulted in a complete failure almost unique in AMSAT\u2019s history. While there must \nbe a risk of    failure in realizing new capabilities, and there are speci fi c technical expla-\nnations for the failure of OSCAR 40, the low cost, rapid development, and high reli-\nability demonstrated in micro spacecraft are ensured only in the development of \nsystems of low complexity which can be developed on a brief schedule, less than \n2 years, and by a team of less than 20 people, more conservatively less than 12 peo-\nple.

These manage-\nment tools should be eliminated in favor of peer reviews and the buddy system, but \nas most contracts will require them, they should be managed. Use them to create \ndocumentation\u2014to archive not just the design but the logic behind design choices. \nSome well-meaning person will one day say \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you do X instead of what \nyou did do?\u201d regarding some element of the design. It is useful to say \u201cwe considered \n19 ways to handle that problem and comparing them, chose this route based on our \nbest knowledge at the time.\u201d Keep the reviews short, insist on doing them at your own \nlocation to avoid travel. \n\n Possibly the most damage done by the culture of the PDR and CDR is the idea of \nwaiting to buy (or even order) anything until the CDR is complete and signed off \n(which can happen months after the CDR if the reviewers succeed in creating a \nsuf fi cient number of nearly impossible action items your team must complete instead \nof building the satellite). One way in which small missions differ from larger ones is \nthat because the same team works on the satellite from concept to on-orbit, iteration \nis possible. In a classical mission, when the design phase ends, the project is turned \nover to the fabrication groups, and the design therefore must be frozen. Thus, when \na part is found to be no longer in production, money is wasted to restart production. \nFailing that, or when the inevitable impossibilities are found in the design when it is \nput to the test of reality, the now-dispersed design team must be reassembled, at great \ncost and waste of time, and never completely possible, and asked to remember what \nthey did and why, and now how to do it differently, while the fabrication team awaits \nthe redesign, reordering of parts, etc. \n\n Instead the small team begins ordering parts as soon as they are reasonably sure of \ntheir needs. Before the PDR ideally   . If parts are not available, the design can be \naltered before too much effort is invested in its perfection and  fi nalization. When parts \ncome in subsystems are built\u2014to discover problems early. This is particularly impor-\ntant for new and innovative elements of the project. Being compelled to do the CDR \nis a problem but mainly for your budget. Being constrained from buying and building \nfrom day 0 is much more damaging to the ability to manage budget and schedule. \n\n If 100 assemblies are due on a date, and started in time to make that date, some \npercent will develop problems and be late. The entire program will then wait. The \nsolution is to start each assembly process as soon as possible, and  fi nish it as soon as \npossible, before it is needed. Only a few, if any, assemblies should be due even near \nto the date when integration will begin. The fewer, the less likely    a delay. Avoid the \ndelusion of partial integration\u2014building a satellite without some of its components \nforces the team to simulate those components\u2014the space they would take, for \ninstance, to see if the rest goes together. It is at best a compromise. Better to have \neverything ready and dive into integration with the entire kit at the ready. \n\n The team should be constantly archiving their designs, their communications, their \nanalyses, photos, videos, and other notes about how things were done, blind alleys, \nfailures. This should be a way of working every day, not an archiving task put off for \na quiet day. There are no quiet days. Essentially your team should leave at the end of \nthe day with the shop cleaned and orderly, meaning all notes are recorded, photos \ntaken and sent to archives, failure reports done. Stop work 30 min early and enforce \nthis habit. Eighty percent of the events of the day are forgotten by the next morning. \n\n\n\n267Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\n AeroAstro formalized a practice which in some form is a part of every mission, but \noften not recognized in smaller missions, that we called the FIST\u2014Fully Integrated \nSystem Test. How do you know, after integrating and testing the satellite, that after \ndisassembling it and shipping to the launch site in numerous boxes, and then reas-\nsembling it, that it is the same satellite, that it still works and would pass all the tests \nagain if it were asked to? The answer is the FIST, designed by the team that builds the \nsatellite, the FIST is a series of procedures that checks every aspect of the satellite\u2019s \nform and function. It is repeated every time the satellite con fi guration is changed\u2014for \na repair, for a shipment, for inserting and extricating at a test site. If it is instituted the \nvery  fi rst time the satellite is made to work in fully integrated form, by the time of the \nlaunch the team will be highly sensitive to any irregularities. It is one thing to suffer \na failure in orbit, but another to suffer a failure in orbit because the satellite launched \nwas not the one that was designed, built, tested, and shipped to the launch site because \nsome part of it was missing or broken. In general, spacecraft programs are highly \nattuned to look for exotic problems, but highly insensitive to the more likely failure \ncauses, and the FIST is meant to protect from at least one of these. \n\n The FIST is also 80% of the  fl ight readiness review, which is a required review in \nvirtually every program, big or small. There is no stronger evidence than a heritage \ntest that has served you well for months indicating the spacecraft is exactly in its \nnominal state to ensure the customer that you are truly ready for launch. \n\n One element more dangerous to a satellite than a failure to faithfully repeat the FIST \nis hurrying. Well-meaning managers seeing a little daylight in a schedule will ask for \nmore tests, more meetings, more analysis, and more planning, to exploit that extra \ntime. Why waste it? I advise not wasting it, but accelerating progress ahead of schedule. \nRushing the spacecraft is no different than rushing out of the house in the morning to get \nto work in time\u2014both seem like a good idea. But then half way to work when you realize \nyou forgot the keys to your of fi ce, or your badge, or the  fl ash drive with the  fi nal version \nof the presentation you have to make to the customer at 10 a.m., you are once again \nreminded of the folly of rushing. Which nonetheless we continue to experience, never \nquite learning that empty time to look around and rethinking everything before heading \nout has tremendous value. A well-managed program does not rush, it ticks ever forward, \nand it is ready ahead of time giving everyone time to think\u2014did I forget anything. \n\n That period of re fl ection exists in all space missions\u2014the mandatory hold. \nUnfortunately the mandatory hold has now been  fi lled with hold activities\u2014it is even \nmore mandatory, but it is not a hold. That is the stop light at the end of the mission. \nStop and make sure you took    off all the remove before  fl ight covers, tightened the \naccess port doors, connected the red wire to the plus side of the battery. The satellite \nmight still fail but at least it will not be for a stupid reason. And if you eliminate the \nobvious, you eliminate most of the risk for hardware as thoroughly tested as yours \nwill be assuming you left adequate schedule and money for integration and test, and \ndid not waste it on overanalysis.  \n\n    8.12.   Case Studies \n\n Engineering is an applied science and building small satellites is not about theory so \nmuch as about doing what needs to be done to get a certain capability done on orbit. \nNo one program can span the entire population of situations, strategies, problems \n\n\n\n268 Space Program Management\n\nresolved. In this section and in the next chapter, we look at a few selected programs \nto illustrate not only how speci fi c elements of small program management are imple-\nmented, but also how these missions were kept simple, thus enabling a successful \nsmall satellite mission. \n\n      Early Programs \n\n The renaissance of small spacecraft occurred through a series of programs in the \n1980s and early 1990s which demonstrated that microsatellites could provide real \nutility beyond as projects for hobbyists. The Array of Low Energy X-ray Imaging \nSensors (ALEXIS) spacecraft program was initiated in 1989 and launched in 1993. \nALEXIS marked a change in the thinking about the role of microspace, transitioning \nit from the realm of amateur radio and hobbyist missions to an accepted tool for doing \nthose space missions, for science, defense, remote sensing, or communications, \nwhich it can address. It is representative of the smallest and most cost-constrained \nmissions which are performed under formal contract, comparable to many of the \nearly SurreySats, the MightySat series, the smallest of the Operationally Responsive \nSpace programs, the path fi nding DSI GLOMR store and forward comsats, followed \nby their Stacsat series and the Swedish Astrid series, among many others accom-\nplished by companies, governments, and universities around the world. \n\n All elements of the ALEXIS mission shared a commitment to achieve mission \nsuccess by minimizing spacecraft complexity and imposition of formal program \nrequirements on the small development team. \n\n The medium-sized missions section of the next chapter analyzes missions that \npush the envelope of what may be considered and managed as small, to show how \nthe ideals explained up to this point are modi fi ed to accomplish a somewhat larger, \nmore complex and more formal mission, with more money at stake and a more criti-\ncal mission to accomplish. This type of program and management environment is the \npredominant one in which the small space manager will  fi nd herself. Customers like \nthe idea of small and low cost and fast, but they want all of the procedures and for-\nmality and assurances they are used to in large, slow complex missions. It is critical \nto be able to walk that tightrope. Missions in this category include in Sweden Odin \nand SMART, in Italy AGILE and MIOSAT, in the US STP-SAT, Tac-Sat 2 and \nJMAPS, in Germany RapidEye, in Israel OFEQ, and numerous others. \n\n The future of microspace will in part depend on the successful operation of con-\nstellations and clusters, groups of small satellites to provide capabilities beyond those \nof a single satellite regardless of its size. Small satellites are the only economically \nviable means of  fi elding large numbers of satellites to provide a particular capability. \nWe are already literally surrounded by examples of this approach in earth orbit\u2014\nmultiple geo imaging satellites provide global weather data, a constellation of GPS \nsatellites makes possible global positioning and precise time keeping, the Orbcomm, \nGlobalstar, and Iridium constellations provide global communications via hand-held \ndevices. The multiple satellite section of the next chapter looks at the development of \nthe second generation Orbcomm satellite constellation as a case study. A multiple \nsatellite system differs fundamentally in its approach to reliability, and designing the \nprogram around this single principle highlights the special advantages and challenges \nassociated with building a large number of identical satellites.  \n\n\n\n269Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\n      ALEXIS Satellite Program Management Case Study \n\n ALEXIS began as a concept in the late 1980s not as a small satellite mission but as a \nplan to test innovative sensors developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory \n(LANL) as a payload attached to the Space Shuttle (STS), itself second to the inter-\nnational space station the largest spacecraft on earth. The LANL team was faced with \nnumerous obstacles to that plan that typify the limitations of large space programs. \nThe idea of carrying out a rapid test of their sensors in space as a milestone along a \ndevelopment program was incompatible with STS manifesting which is de fi ned many \nyears in advance, is highly competitive, and subject to change even very late in the \nprogram\u2019s maturation depending on higher priorities of support to human crews of \nthe STS and the Space Station it serviced, to military missions, to exigencies of larger \nmissions (e.g., if they require more of the STS\u2019s payload mass to launch), and to \nrequirements of numerous international partners who depended on the STS. \n\n As a shared platform, which is typical of almost all large spacecraft, the STS could \nnot be compelled to point in the direction necessary for the test, thus during its \n7\u201310 days in orbit, it was unknown how much actual test time would be available. \nThus after years and millions of dollars of development time, it was possible the sen-\nsors would only be tested for a few hours, or not at all. Whereas to prove their ef fi cacy \nfor their intended mission, it was desired to have at least a few hundred hours of on-\norbit operational experience in the desired spatial orientation. \n\n As a human mission platform, the safety requirements of STS (and also of Space \nStation and other crewed vehicles and platforms) are extremely rigorous. This meant \nthat the cost to develop the test apparatus and to prove its safety to NASA\u2019s review \nboard would likely exceed the few million dollars available in the LANL R&D bud-\nget for the test program. Compromises to the design to accommodate the safety \nrequirements would result in instruments  fl own not entirely representative of those \nplanned for their ultimate application aboard robotic spacecraft without human \ncrews. \n\n The idea of instead launching a few sensors aboard a small satellite proved attrac-\ntive because:\n\n   Even 1 month on orbit lifetime would provide much more operational experience  \u2013\nthan even the most favorable STS  fl ight opportunity.  \n  A dedicated spacecraft would be pointed full-time in the direction most favorable  \u2013\nfor testing the instruments.  \n  The instrument design and on-orbit operating environment would be identical to  \u2013\nthat planned for their eventual deployment.  \n  From an organizational point of view, LANL saw an opportunity to decouple their  \u2013\nactivities from the rigidity of the NASA manifest constraints, especially the mis-\nsion prioritization and scheduling, not only for this mission but for the future, if \nthe microsatellite approach would prove successful.  \n  The test was not an operational mission with national security implications. As an  \u2013\nR&D activity, it was not constrained by the procedures and processes which must \nbe implemented in operational programs.    \n\n The laboratory carried out a series of internal and funded studies to determine \npotential architectures, project costs, and schedules and assess the likely capabilities \n\n\n\n270 Space Program Management\n\nof a low-cost micro spacecraft host for the ALEXIS payload, resulting in a formal \nrequest for proposals in 1988 and a contract award in 1989. \n\n The studies provided the opportunity for the  fi rst phase of the microspace pro-\ngram\u2014trading off requirements against those elements which are dif fi cult or hard to \naccomplish in a microsatellite platform. Los Alamos had envisioned a full three-axis \nstabilized platform with a suite of four momentum wheels. In the study it was deter-\nmined that in fact the spacecraft could slowly spin, rotate about one of its axes, and \neliminate the need for momentum wheels to achieve attitude stiffness. Other innova-\ntions which enabled the mission to be accomplished via the small project paradigm \nincluded a communications system which did not require continuous contact but \nrather accommodated interruptions in the signal as the spacecraft rotated, accom-\nplished in software, elimination of propulsion for attitude control in favor of a mag-\nnetic system requiring no thrusters, tanks, valves or propellant, use of a terrestrial \nmicroprocessor, the Intel 8086, which at the time offered much lower cost and power \nconsumption with much higher computing power than space quali fi ed alternatives, a \ndedicated micro ground station at Los Alamos instead of using Air Force facilities \nwhich while highly capable also impose numerous requirements on the spacecraft, \nand to accommodate this single, simple ground station, a very large on-board digital \nmemory, also based on terrestrial, commercially available RAM, to store data accu-\nmulated when the satellite was not in range of its ground station. \n\n The result of a highly competitive procurement process was the selection of \nAeroAstro as the spacecraft contractor, contracted at a price of $1.8 million for a \n10-month development effort followed by a similar length effort to be accomplished \nat Los Alamos where the payload would be integrated to the satellite bus. The parts \nbudget, composed of many terrestrial or custom built elements to constrain cost, \naccounted for about $700,000, thus leaving a total labor budget of about $900,000 \nafter subtracting other costs including travel. \n\n Over a 2-year period this implied an average staf fi ng including management of \neight to ten people at contemporary labor rates. As a very small business, at the time \noperating out of a suburban residence, AeroAstro\u2019s overhead rates were very low, \nlabor overhead below 50% and General and Administrative overhead below 10%. \nHad the job been awarded to a conventional contractor, that labor budget would have \ninstead supported three to four people and the project would not have been possible. \nSmall missions do not require the large, sophisticated development and test facilities \n(including high bays, clean rooms, large thermal vacuum test chambers) characteris-\ntic of major programs, allowing them to be built in a home (as was done for tens of \nAMSAT missions), university, or in the test bench environment made available at \nLANL. Thus this overhead rate is not anomalous but rather a result of the cost struc-\nture of an organization designed expressly for developing simpler and smaller space \nsystems (Fig.  8.5 ).  \n\n ALEXIS integration in shirtsleeves environment at LANL  fl ight solar panels vis-\nible in bubble wrap on tabletop lower left. \n\n      HETE \n The desktop development environment was neither special to ALEXIS nor Los \nAlamos. Virtually every small satellite is designed to be built and tested in a normal \nlaboratory environment because the additional time and cost of operating in special \n\n\n\n271Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\nenvironments and the special care required of a fragile product which could be dam-\naged in contact with the everyday environment are neither compatible with a small \nbudget and team, nor with reliability except for those programs with large enough \nbudgets to ensure that all of those environmental requirements can be maintained \nover the life of the spacecraft. The MIT/NASA HETE (High Energy Transient \nExperiment) satellite shown below is another of many such examples. These and \nother missions developed on kitchen tables, in university of fi ces, and in industrial \nshops have proven highly reliable on orbit. ALEXIS operated for 12 years and was \nintentionally shut down having more than accomplished its mission. HETE remains \noperational on orbit many years beyond its projected lifetime (Fig.  8.6 ).   \n\n      Program Planning \n The program plan did include two formal reviews, the PDR and CDR, which were \ncarried out at Los Alamos staffed by about six AeroAstro engineers and about double \nthat number of Los Alamos personnel. The reviews were each compressed into 1 day \nwith a half day follow-up for discussion of issues raised and were an opportunity for \nproblem solving, not evaluation (the two do not mix). The program management team \nat Los Alamos undertook the dif fi cult job of shielding the program from the \nLaboratory\u2019s infrastructure normally activated for monitor and control of their space \nand high reliability programs. \n\n The justi fi cation was that the ALEXIS program was not mission critical and was \nof limited scope and budget. Nonetheless, this was politically and bureaucratically \n\n  Figure 8.5.    ALEXIS Shirtsleeve Development Environment (courtesy Rick Fleeter).       \n\n\n\n272 Space Program Management\n\ndif fi cult and unpopular. It was illustrative of a problem the small program manager \nvery often faces\u2014protecting the program from the processes and procedures imposed \non larger programs\u2014for reviews, for documentation, for controls on procurement, on \nquality, on testing, on every aspect of the design, build and test  fl ow, which are not \ncompatible with the capabilities of a team composed of a few individuals charged \nwith design, development integration, and test of an entire spacecraft in less than a \nyear. But these procedures are bypassed not just for economic or managerial reasons. \nThey are imposed on small programs based on the (incorrect) assumption that every \nspace program has the same management requirements. But a small satellite is much \nless like a large satellite than it is like a small custom built terrestrial device like an \nautomated antenna test machine or a specialized factory  fl oor robot, devices that are \nnot developed with management procedures similar to those of a major space pro-\ngram. These methods are inappropriate to a small mission in part because reliability \ndepends less on controls and formal communications via documentation and manage-\nment structure, and more on the simplicity of the design and hardware and the close \nand detailed communications which can only be realized among members of a small \nhighly cross-linked team.  \n\n      ALEXIS Time Management \n In minimizing cost we have talked about controlling the program scope and com-\nplexity, thus allowing use of a small team, managing appropriately for the small \nteam, basing the program at an organization designed for simpler, smaller space \nprograms, and resisting peripheral activities including extensive reviews and docu-\nmentation and frequent communications between organizations directly with \n\n  Figure 8.6.    HETE (courtesy Rick Fleeter).       \n\n \n\n\n\n273Management of Small, Low-Cost Space Programs: A New Paradigm \n\nmembers of the development team, which while proffered as aids to a successful \nprogram outcome instead expend resources and extend program duration, stealing \nresources that otherwise could be applied to the critical functions of engineering, \nbuild, test, integration, integrated systems test, and so on. \n\n The program manager is acutely aware that time is money. While in theory staff \ncould be transferred to other projects when not immediately required on ALEXIS, the \npractice is impractical and undesirable. Once transferred the memory of what was \nengineering and built, and why, fades rapidly and the getting back up to speed is \ncostly and risky. Sometimes the staff member is not available immediately to rejoin \nthe program, creating further delays for the others, or requiring her or his replacement \nwith the subsequent costs of time for training and integration into the team, and of \n fi delity of information. New staff inevitably bring with them new ways of doing \nthings and often spend time redoing work already done in another way. When staff \nare on travel, for meetings and especially for the launch campaign, their expenses \ncannot be reduced in case of delays. \n\n The acute  fi nancial pressures on ALEXIS were in part addressed through mini-\nmization of complexity of the spacecraft and thus of the size of the staff, number of \nmeetings, and reliance on many \u201chi-rel\u201d space practices, but also through compres-\nsion of schedule. The manager must  fi nd, however, a balance. Extreme time pres-\nsure can go beyond the minimum cost point. To save even more time, express \nshipping which costs more, pressure on the team which causes errors or burnout, are \ncounterproductive. Management is about judgment and the manager at the center \nof the program is positioned to design the schedule to minimize global cost. \nManagement is a creative job requiring imagination,  fi nding ways to do things in \ninnovative ways to reduce work and hence cost and particularly in small programs, \nthis talent and the interpersonal skills for implementing innovative methods adapted \nto speci fi c program factors is critical. \n\n Particularly illustrative of this point is the ALEXIS launch campaign. Recognizing \nthat sending an integrated Los Alamos/AeroAstro team out on an extended campaign \naway from our bases would be a budget-buster, a streamlined launch campaign \nstaffed by three LANL and three AeroAstro personnel, compressed into 15 days was \ndesigned and executed. The satellite was in orbit on the 16th day after being loaded \ninto a truck at Los Alamos for transport to the launch site, the runway at Edwards Air \nForce Base, California where a B-52 would carry it, integrated onto the Pegasus \nrocket, on the  fi rst leg of the trajectory to space. \n\n The  fi gure below shows the day-to-day timeline of the launch campaign. \nInnovative elements include the use of our own staff to transport the satellite, and \nthemselves, to the launch site in a single truck following by a staff car. The space-\ncraft, its ground support equipment and spares, and its team, could not help but \narrive together. Pegasus itself was designed for rapid launch. The major challenge \nwas adapting the staffs involved, of LANL, AeroAstro and the Air Force, to the \nplanned pace. The FIST at this point had been performed multiple times and \nrequired only a few hours to verify, to the team and to the clients, that the spacecraft \nwas in fact in the same condition it had been before ship. Management had com-\nmunicated the compressed schedule to the Air Force so that all staff were available \nat the site avoiding waiting for the organization of the required readiness reviews \n(Fig.  8.7 ).  \n\n\n\n274 Space Program Management\n\n A team of six from the payload and bus organizations took ALEXIS from the clean \nroom at Los Alamos to launch in 16 days. \n\n The government procurement process is bureaucratic and takes time, and a system \ndesign bene fi ts from time to create and iterate to  fi nd the most ef fi cient means to \naccomplish a mission. With time and motivation, the complexity and eventually the \nsize and cost of the mission can be dramatically reduced. The ALEXIS program \noverall timeline shown below illustrates that despite its supposedly abbreviated \nschedule in fact the period from mission conception through launch was 6 years \n(Fig.  8.8 ).  \n\n ALEXIS achieved low cost because time was expended early in the program when \nthe rate of spending is minimal to achieve the most ef fi cient system and program \ndesign possible. \n\n Most of these 6 years were spent in studies aimed at minimizing mission require-\nments, minimizing system complexity, and designing a development program, tightly \nintegrated between key performers, the management and payload developers at Los \nAlamos, the bus supplier/contractor, the launch organization and the Los Alamos and \nUS Air Force oversight, that could be accomplished with minimum staff and time. \nThe key concept is that the    rate of spending at the concept stage is minimal, a few \nthousand dollars per month, whereas a month of operation for a 12-person team plus \nequipment on lease, facilities, management at the payload/client organization, and \nother associated direct costs such as travel and infrastructure can cost 100 times as \n\nTruck with ALEXIS and Ground Support Equipment leaves\nLos Alamos for launch at Edwards AFB\n\n11 Truck arrives EAFB\n\n12 Unpack satellite and cround support equipment\n\n13 Mission Readiness Review (USAF)\n\n14 FIST (Fully Integrated System Test) and launch rehearsal\n\n15 Battery and Connector Closeout\n\n16\n\n17 Final FIST\n\n18 Rest / hold day\n\n19 Pegasus Launch Vehicle flight review\n\n20 Launch vehicle integration planning\n\n21 Pre-mate preparation\n\n22  Mate to Pegasus, Install fairing\n\n23  Mate to Pylon adapter that attaches to launch aircraft\n\n24  Rollate and mate to B-52 launch aircraft\n\n25  Air drop and launch to orbit from B-52 at 6:56 AM local time\n\nALEXIS Satellite Launch Timeline\n\nApril 10 \n\n1993, March 8 Flight readiness review complete at LANL\n\n  Figure 8.7.

Time spent early in the program to  fi nd every possible ef fi ciency throughout \nthe program lifetime, and continuing to address these innovations throughout the \nprogram lifetime is always a good investment.    \n\n    8.13.   The Requirements Trap \n\n The practice of large space programs of issuing complicated lengthy and detailed \ntender calls with every aspect of the program already spelled out in detail is anathema \nto low cost. The greatest value of the integrated team is the interactive search for sav-\nings, not just in money, but in complexity, in risk, and in schedule which is made \nimpossible by the rigidity built into what has become conventional space program \nmanagement. The lack of  fl exibility and reliability on  fi xed speci fi cations and proce-\ndures is not unique to space and is found throughout the sphere of major systems \ndevelopment\u2014in air, space, sea, and on the ground, for instance in the development \nof a skyscraper or large bridge or power plant. It is not, however, found in small \nprojects involving less than 10\u201320 staff. To impose the methods of either one upon \nthe other is a formula for disaster. Keep the program small, the engineering simple, \nthe timeline short, and use the methods best suited to that environment, those \ndescribed in this chapter. \n\n  Figure 8.8.

This does not necessarily mean \nreturn to the full blown large program model. Many if not most \u201csmall\u201d programs are \ntoo big to be accomplished according to the ideal model described in this section, and \nover the past 20 years a new hybrid category of intermediate missions has become \npossibly the fastest growing segment of space missions, comprising programs with \nbudgets from $10 million to a few hundred million dollars, and usually involving \nspacecraft with mass between 100 kg and 500 kg. The next section addresses the \nmanagement of these medium-sized missions again using a few successful programs \nas case studies. \n\n Even in a medium class mission, the concepts of absolute minimum mission exe-\ncution serve the manager as an ideal to strive for, tempered by the realities of the more \ncomplex and larger program.       \n\n\n\n277\n\n              Here below three different types of space programs are described. The focus on the \nprogram management provides points of views for understanding strategies and \nmethods to achieve a successful space mission. \n\n    9.1.   Large Civil Governmental Satellite Program: The NASA \nAdvanced Communication Satellite Program Advanced \nCommunications Technology Satellite    \n\n  The section is an extract      of the book \u201cThe Advanced Communications Technology \nSatellite\u201d written by Richard Gedney, Ronald Schertler and Frank Gargione, pub-\nlished in 2000 by SciTech Publishing Inc. The reproduction of this text has been \nauthorized by the authors.  \n\n      Program Conception: A Mix of Politics and Technology \n\n In 1978, as a result of the Presidential Directive, NASA began the process of \nrebuilding its R&D activities in the communication satellite arena. The future tech-\nnology program was planned in cooperation with the National Research Council\u2019s \nSpace Applications Board Subcommittee on Satellite Communications, whose \nmembership consisted of leading common carriers, spacecraft manufacturers, and \nrepresentatives of communication users. \n\n In this  fi rst phase of the NASA program, market and system studies were con-\nducted to determine future service demand and whether or not C- and Ku-band satel-\nlites could satisfy it. Two contracts were awarded to common carriers: Western Union \nTelegraph Company and U.S. Telephone and Telegraph Company, which was a sub-\nsidiary of International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT). The emphasis of these studies \nwas to forecast the telecommunications traf fi c that could be carried by satellite com-\npetitively. During this same time frame, two other system studies were conducted\u2014\none each by Hughes Aircraft and Ford Aerospace, with supporting studies by TRW \nCorporation, General Electric GE, and the Mitre Corporation. \n\n Their purpose was to identify the technology needed to implement cost-effective \nand spectrum-conservative communication systems. The results were combined to \n\n    Chapter 9   \n\n Examples of Management Applied \nto Different Space Programs       \n\nM.

A combination of these market projections and communication satellite \nlicense  fi lings with the FCC portended a saturation of North American orbital arc \ncapacity using the C- and Ku-band frequencies. \n\n To relieve the pressure of this expanding market, the 30/20 GHz frequency band \nwas needed. \n\n As a result, the new NASA communication program for commercial application \nwas named the 30/20 GHz Program and was structured to:\n\n   Develop selective high-risk, 30/20 GHz technologies that focused on relief of orbit \u2022 \nand frequency congestion and developing new and affordable services  \n  Promote effective utilization of the spectrum and growth in communications \u2022 \ncapacity  \n  Ensure continued U.S. preeminence in satellite communications    \u2022 \n\n The technologies required to meet these objectives were judged to be of such high \ntechnical risk that they were beyond the capability of any one company to  fi nance \n(Figure  9.1 ). \n\n In 1979, NASA designated the Lewis Research Center (LeRC) in Cleveland, Ohio, \nto be its lead center in planning and executing the commercial communication satellite \ntechnology R&D Program. In 1999, the LeRC\u2019s name was changed to the Glenn \nResearch Center (GRC), in honor of John Glenn, astronaut and U.S. Senator from Ohio. \nEarly communication satellite systems employed simple, bent-pipe transponders with a \nsingle antenna beam to cover a large region (such as the continental United States). \n\n The new NASA program needed to develop technology that would allow the \nfrequency spectrum to be used more ef fi ciently. One technique to accomplish this \nwas to cover the region with many small spot beams so that the same frequency \ncould be reused simultaneously in nonadjacent beams. Such frequency reuse \nincreased the capacity of satellites by a factor of  fi ve to ten times that of a single \nbeam satellite, with only a modest increase in spacecraft size, power, and weight. \nThe technology to accomplish this high degree of frequency reuse employed anten-\nnas with high-gain spot beams and electronic systems with onboard switching and \nprocessing to interconnect the spot beams. In addition, the high-gain antenna \nallowed for smaller aperture user terminals at higher data rates. This was the tech-\nnology developed by NASA (Figure  9.2 ). \n\n      Technology Feasibility and Flight System De fi nition \n In 1980, the program moved forward in two phases. The  fi rst phase was to:\n\n    1.    Continue the market studies to increase con fi dence in the forecast for orbit \nsaturation.  \n\n    2.    To do proof-of-concept (POC) development of the identi fi ed technologies.     \n\n The POC program was a laboratory (breadboard) type of development to prove that \nthe technologies were feasible. Approximately $50 M was expended on the  fi rst phase. \n\n\n\n279\n\n10,000\n\n1000\n\nU.S. DOMESTIC\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nSATELLITE DEMAND\nAND\n\nSUPPLY FORECAST\n\nTERRESTRIAL\nCOMMUNICATION\nESTIMATE (1979)\n\nCAPACITY UNIT OF CONVENTIONAL\nDOMEATS PLUS ADVANCE\nCOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY SATELLITES\n\nCAPACITY LIMIT OF\nCONVENTIONAL DOMEATS\n\nORIGINAL DEMAND ESTIMATE (1978)\n\nREVISED DEMAND ESTIMATE (1960)\n\nSUPPLY\n\n100\n\nE\nQ\n\nU\nIV\n\nA\nLE\n\nN\nT\n\n (\n36\n\n M\nH\n\nz)\n T\n\nR\nA\n\nN\nS\n\nP\nO\n\nN\nD\n\nE\nR\n\nS\n\n1975 1980 1985 1990\nYEAR\n\nDEMAND FOR COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE CAPACITY\nCANNOT BE SATISFIED WITH CURRENT TECHNOLOGY\n\n1995 2000\n\n  Figure 9.1.

(\u201cThe Advanced Communications \nTechnology Satellite\u201d book source).       \n\nExamples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\nIf the  fi rst phase proved successful, the second phase would consist of developing an \nexperimental  fl ight system to demonstrate that the technologies could provide reliable \ncommunication services. The  fi rst phase was fully supported by the entire service \nprovider and satellite manufacturing community. The second phase of the program \nwas the one that became controversial. The service providers had great concern about \nhow reliably the technology would work in space, and therefore, argued for a  fl ight \nprogram. Some satellite manufacturers, however, had reservations about proceeding \nwith a  fl ight program because they felt it would give the winning contractors of the \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n280 Space Program Management\n\nNASA procurement an unfair competitive advantage. This controversy continued \nthroughout most of the life of the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite \n(ACTS) program.  \n\n      Program Coordination with Industry \n Two industry committees were formed to guide the program. The NASA Ad Hoc \nAdvisory Committee was created to provide general policy direction. The committee \nincluded notable representatives of both the system supplier and service supplier \nindustry. Their contribution provided timely and sage review of the program, as well \nas providing NASA with insight into the industry philosophy relative to the roles and \nresponsibilities of both government and the private sector. \n\n The second industry committee was a Carrier Working Group (CWG), consisting \nof representatives from all the major satellite service providers. The CWG was \ncharged with helping NASA formulate the technology and  fl ight system require-\nments, develop experiments, and provide overall guidance. These requirements and \nexperiments were deemed necessary by the CWG to demonstrate the readiness of not \nonly the technology, but of its service applications as well. \n\n Coordination was also established between the Department of Defense (DOD) \nand NASA, especially in the development of various critical advanced technology \ncomponents.  \n      POC Development \n The purpose of the POC technology development was to demonstrate the technical \nfeasibility of the key component building blocks. The approach NASA used was to \nissue multiple contracts to various aerospace and related companies for the develop-\nment of each high-risk technology: multiple spot beam antenna, base band processor, \nTWTA, wide-bandswitch matrices, low-noise receiver, GaAs FET transmitter, GaAs \ntransmitter, and ground antenna. \n\n Duplicate awards for most of the critical technology components were employed \nto increase the probability of successful development, and to produce multiple \nsources for communication hardware. In addition, multiple awards helped to ensure \nthat a variety of perspectives and technical approaches were brought into each \ndevelopment. \n\n These contracts called for the development of the technology, the construction \nof POC versions of the components, and their testing in the laboratory to verify \nperformance. The POC hardware substantially reduced the risk associated with the \nplanned development of the  fl ight system. Another product of these technology \ncontracts was the prediction of feasible component, subsystem, and system perfor-\nmance levels. NASA used these performance predictions to provide guidance for \nfollow-on technology development. Service providers and manufacturers could \nalso use these predictions in planning activities for the commercial system designs \nof the early 1990s. \n\n The DOD participated in the NASA POC program. Several of the critical technology \nPOC elements that were of interest to the DOD were co-funded by DOD and NASA. To \nenable the effective transfer of information that was generated in the program, all con-\ntractors were required to prepare task completion reports. These reports were presented \nat periodic industry brie fi ngs (only for interested U.S. parties) hosted by NASA.  \n\n\n\n281Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n      Flight System De fi nition Studies \n The need for a  fl ight test program re fl ected the fact that much of the required technology \nhad never been demonstrated in space. The  fl ight test was to ensure that the technology \nbase was mature and validated, providing the level of con fi dence recommended \nby industry as being necessary for commercial exploitation. \n\n The initial planning called for two experimental satellites to be built and  fl own; \none to demonstrate telephone trunking for high volume users in metropolitan areas, \nand the other to demonstrate customer premises services using small and inexpensive \nearth terminals located at customer locations. In 1980, the two- fl ight concept was \nreduced to a single experimental spacecraft, primarily emphasizing customer prem-\nises services. \n\n This proved to be a wise decision since the introduction of  fi ber optics a few years \nlater signi fi cantly reduced the cost for terrestrial trunking services, making satellites \nnoncompetitive. In February 1982, Dr. Burt Edelson became NASA\u2019s associate \nadministrator of the Of fi ce of Space Science and Application, and played a very \nimportant role in keeping the program alive. \n\n When the program was seriously threatened in 1982, Dr. Edelson restructured the \n30/20 GHz program by broadening its applicability to the entire frequency spectrum \nfor satellite communications. \n\n As a result, the experimental satellite system was renamed the ACTS, and it \nfocused primarily on the technology of multibeam antennas (MBAs) and associated \nonboard switching and processing. Spacecraft capacity was reduced to a minimum \nfor technical veri fi cation and experimentation only. Dr. Edelson provided key leader-\nship for the ACTS program during his tenure at NASA, and has been a vocal propo-\nnent of the program and its bene fi ts ever since. \n\n Two other NASA managers who provided important leadership to the NASA \nCommunications Program were Joe Sivo and Bob Lovell. Joe Sivo was the chief of \nthe Communications and Applications division at NASA\u2019s LeRC in Cleveland, Ohio. \nJoe was the \u201cFather of ACTS\u201d and led the LeRC team in the late 1970s and the early \n1980s as NASA restructured its communication program. Bob Lovell became chief \nof the Communications division at NASA Headquarters and worked with both Dr. \nEdelson and Joe Sivo to structure the ACTS program and guide it through technical \nand political hurdles in the early 1980s. Without Sivo, Lovell, and Edelson, the ACTS \n fl ight program would have never gotten off the ground. \n\n Concurrent with the POC technology development, NASA was working with \nindustry to de fi ne  fl ight system concepts that would demonstrate ACTS technology \nreadiness and its service capabilities. During the period of 1981\u20131983, the major \nspacecraft manufacturers, Ford Aerospace (now Space Systems Loral), Hughes \nAircraft (now Boeing Satellite Systems), TRW (now Northrop Grumman Corp.), and \nGE and RCA Corporation (both now part of Lockheed Martin) were funded by \nNASA to conduct system studies for de fi ning an R&D spacecraft (ACTS) that could \nbe  fl own by NASA. NASA then used the results from these system studies to develop \nthe Request for Proposal (RFP) for the ACTS spacecraft and ground system. \n\n This RFP was issued by NASA in early 1983, with a proposal due date of June 1, \n1983. Since the RFP required the development of very high-risk technology that had \nnever been  fl own before, a cost-plus- fi xed-fee type of contract was speci fi ed. The  fi ve \n\n\n\n282 Space Program Management\n\nseparate  fl ight system studies were conducted to get a wide range of views on what \nthe ACTS spacecraft con fi guration should be and to promote competition for the \nprocurement of the spacecraft. \n\n As it turns out, this process did not accomplish the latter objective and was \n complicated by the fact that there was not a clear consensus for the need for a  fl ight \nprogram to prove the feasibility of the new technology. \n\n The Reagan administration espoused a minimal government involvement \n ideology. At the time, the Republican administration took the position that it was not \nthe proper role of government to conduct a  fl ight program for the purpose of proving \ntechnology for commercial purposes, especially for a pro fi table industry. \n\n There were many arguments presented by the Republican administration as to why \nthe government should not sponsor the  fl ight veri fi cation. \n\n These included arguments that the government was not capable of predicting tech-\nnology for commercial application, and that the spot beam, frequency-reuse technol-\nogy was not necessary because there was plenty of C and Ku-band spectrum for \nfuture use. However, as we know today, the use of spot beams allows a great increase \nin the amount of frequency reuse so that a single satellite can have a very large \ncapacity. \n\n Without this spot beam increase in capacity, many of the mobile and broadband \nsatellite systems under development in the late 1990s, such as Iridium, Globalstar, \nSpaceway, Astrolink, and IpStar (formerly called KaStar), would not have been eco-\nnomical. All the developers of these systems make a strong case that their spot beam \nsystems meet the current FCC requirement to more ef fi ciently use the spectrum. \n\n The FCC has added this requirement since they realized that the frequency spec-\ntrum is a scarce resource. Congress in the 1980s was increasingly concerned about \nU.S. economic competitiveness in high technology industries. They were sensitive to \nareas such as satellite communication being challenged by foreign entities, where the \nfederal government could improve U.S. competitiveness. \n\n The Democratic Congress listened to the arguments of the U.S. commercial satel-\nlite industry in support of a  fl ight veri fi cation program and decided it should be con-\nducted. This debate between the Republican administration and the Democratic \nCongress (including each side\u2019s constituencies) over the need for the ACTS  fl ight test \ncontinued through launch of the ACTS in September of 1993.   \n\n      The Development of ACTS \n\n Most of the ACTS technology had never before been put in space. Its development \nwas a major technical challenge,  fi lled with frustration, stress, and risk-taking, but \noffering major opportunities and rewards. It required a large government/private \nindustry team integrating a variety of disciplines\u2014including science, engineering, \nplanning,  fi nance, and human resources\u2014to accomplish an important goal that made \na real difference. In short, ACTS was being where the action is in the development \nand application of exciting new technologies and processes. \n\n The keys to a successful program are no secret but bear reiteration here to point \nout the complexities of the job, and serve as a basis for understanding the bene fi ts and \nthe mistakes. Some of the main components of a successful program, according to A. \n\n\n\n283Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\nThomas Young (former president of Lockheed Martin and center director of Goddard \nSpace Flight Center), are:\n\n   Finding good, experienced people  \u2022 \n  Instilling attention to detail  \u2022 \n  Building adequate reserves  \u2022 \n  Avoiding political consideration  \u2022 \n  Putting quality  fi rst    \u2022 \n\n      Good, Experienced People \n Getting the right people on the team is what separates successful projects from those \nthat fail. A good engineer is one who has designed something, had it built, and seen \nit fail. There have to be enough experienced personnel (managers, engineers, techni-\ncians, planners, etc.) on the team who will make certain that the same type of mis-\ntakes made on previous projects won\u2019t be repeated. For those who do not have the \nexperience, proper training must be provided.  \n\n      Attention to Detail \n Space projects rarely fail because of large  fl aws. It is usually the overlooking of seem-\ningly small details that dooms otherwise sound programs.  \n\n      Adequate Reserves \n Repair shops are few and far between the earth\u2019s surface and geostationary orbit. \nWorking on an experimental program such as ACTS requires adequate margins in \nfunding, scheduling, spacecraft performance, and so on.  \n\n      Political Consideration \n While every project begins with technical need, political considerations soon tempt \nprojects to leave in other factors that will raise cost and risk. To avoid such in fl uences, \nthe project needs an inviolate shield around it.  \n\n      Quality First \n Performance tests have to be built into each step of the project. Quality cannot be \nbalanced with other variables\u2014it must be the top priority. In this chapter we will \nreview the development of ACTS and provide a scorecard on how well the  fi nancial, \nschedule, and technical objectives were accomplished, as well as the reasons for the \nsuccesses and failures. Using this process, we will see how well these key steps were \nimplemented to achieve a successful project.  \n\n      One Strike for (and Three Strikes Against) a Successful Development \n Motivation is another key factor that makes a big difference in whether or not an \nendeavor is successful. Norman R. Augustine, former chief executive of fi cer of \nLockheed Martin nicely summed up the role that motivation plays in his book entitled \n\u201cAugustine\u2019s Laws.\u201d \n\n He stated that \u201cMotivation makes the difference. In sports this is sometimes \nequated with \u2018mental toughness\u2019\u2014how else can one explain the numerous occasions \neach season when a team soundly beats another only to  fi nd itself thrashed by the \nloser a few weeks later? Motivation will almost always beat mere talent.\u201d \n\n\n\n284 Space Program Management\n\n At the outset, there were major strikes against ACTS that were signi fi cant negative \nmotivation factors:\n\n   First, the federal administration never supported the program and the Of fi ce of \u2022 \nManagement and Budget (OMB) zeroed out the budget for ACTS before the \ndevelopment contract was awarded and during the following 4 years. These \nactions continuously put a negative cast over the project.  \n  Second, there were many people within NASA who opposed ACTS because it \u2022 \nwas not a NASA mission (i.e., it provided technology for commercial purposes \nonly). As a result, many people within NASA considered it a low-priority \nproject.  \n  Finally, there was no planned follow-on to ACTS that could be used by NASA \u2022 \nLeRC as a carrot for getting good contractor performance. When allocating per-\nsonnel resources to jobs, contractors frequently assign the best people to those jobs \nthat will bring in repeat business at a handsome pro fi t. For ACTS, assignment of \nexperienced contractor personnel was a signi fi cant problem.    \n\n The major spacecraft contractors (Hughes, Ford Aerospace, RCA AstroSpace/\nLockheed Martin) competed aggressively with each other for both commercial and \ngovernment contracts. Hughes opposed the development of ACTS and lobbied \nagainst the development contract award to the RCA contractor team that consisted of \n fi rst-tier subcontractors, TRW, and COMSAT. \n\n This action by Hughes was actually a positive motivational factor for RCA. It \nserved to increase the resolve of Charles Schmidt (the head of RCA AstroSpace at the \ntime) to make ACTS successful. In the end, it was largely due to actions by Charles \nSchmidt that led to the successful development of the ACTS program. He placed a \nhigh value on the technology and went to bat for the program both internally and \nexternally.  \n\n      The Initial ACTS Development Contract \n The NASA LeRC awarded the prime contract for the spacecraft, the master control \nstation (MCS), and 2 years of in-orbit operations to RCA (which in time merged \nsuccessively with GE, Martin Marietta, and Lockheed Martin) on August 10, 1984, \nfor $260 M. The contractor team consisted of RCA as the system integrator and \nprovider of the spacecraft bus, TRW as subcontractor for the communications pay-\nload, and COMSAT as subcontractor for the NASA ground station (NGS) and \nMCS. The $260 M did not include the cost of the shuttle launch or the booster to \nplace the spacecraft in a transfer orbit from low-earth, shuttle altitude to geosyn-\nchronous altitude (Figure  9.3 ). \n\n The cost for the launch and the PAM-A booster was not included in the prime \ncontract. \n\n At the time of the contract award, the LeRC cost estimate for development of the \nACTS system was $329 M. This estimated cost included the prime contract, the \nLeRC contingency (approximately 15%), and other development costs including \nsupport for long-lead technology development. This $329 M total did not include \nthe additional program funds levied by NASA\u2019s headquarters for taxes that occur \nat the agency level. \n\n\n\n285\n\nGE-RCA ASTRO-SPACE\n\nGE-RCA TRW COMSAT\nGROUND SYSTEM\nOPS & MAINTENANCE\n\nMOTOROLA\nBASEBAND PROCESSOR\n\nWATKINS-JOHNSON\nTRAVELING WAVE TUBE\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC SCIENCES\nBEAM FORMING NETWORK\n\nMULTIBEAM COM.\nMUNICATIONS PKG.\n\nSPACECRAFT BUS\nFLIGHT SYSTEM I&T\n\nPRIME CONTRACTOR\nSYSTEM ENG., INTEG. & TEST\n\n  Figure 9.3.     Initial contractor team for ACTS system development (1984). (\u201cThe Advanced \nCommunications Technology Satellite\u201d book source).       \n\nExamples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n The ACTS system design, development, and launch preparation period was initially \nplanned for 60 months, with the launch of the spacecraft projected for September of \n1989. The normal commercial communication spacecraft at the time was being developed \nin about 3 years compared to this 5-year scenario. The extra time for ACTS was judged \nto be necessary to overcome new technology hurdles, to develop an extensive commu-\nnications payload engineering model, and to conduct a 3-month, pre-launch systems \ntest for checking out the complicated network between the onboard processor, the MCS, \nand the user terminals. The engineering model for the payload was included to remove \ndevelopment risk. The ground/spacecraft system test is not normally conducted when \nproducing a commercial bent-pipe type spacecraft, but was deemed necessary for this \n fi rst generation, onboard processing satellite (Figure  9.4 ). \n\n Because of the high technical risk and one-of-a-kind nature of the ACTS program, \nthe only practical procurement mechanism was a cost-plus-fee contract. Under this \ntype of contract, the government takes on all cost risks. \n\n Because the technology was being developed for commercial application, the fee \nallotted for the contractors was  fi xed at 5.5%, which was considerably below the \n12\u201313% normally collected. With this fee arrangement, the contractors were, in \nessence, making a direct contribution toward the funding of the program. \n\n That contribution, at the time of award of the contract, was approximately $20 M \n(the fee difference between the normal 13% and the ACTS contract 5.5% fee). \n\n In addition to the lower-than-normal fee, RCA contributed approximately $2 M \nfor the steerable antenna that was added to the spacecraft after contract award. \n\n This steerable beam antenna proved to be a valuable addition and was extensively \nused during ACTS operations. All the major contractors on the team contributed their \nown funds to purchase terminals and/or to support the planning, solicitation, and \nconduct of experiments or user trials. This amounted to approximately $4\u20135 M more \nin contractor contributions.  \n\n \n\n\n\n286\n\n  Figure 9.4.     Initial ACTS development schedule. (From \u201cThe Advanced Communications \nTechnology Satellite\u201d book).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n      The ACTS Development Scorecard \n At the bottom-line level, the technical, schedule, and cost performance is readily \nexpressed:\n\n   The launch occurred on September 12, 1993\u2014some 4 years after the original \u2022 \nplanned date.  \n  NASA LeRC\u2019s cost for the program grew from $329 to $481 M.  \u2022 \n  All technical objectives were met or surpassed.  \u2022 \n  The satellite\u2019s lifetime expectancy was exceeded by more than 3 years.    \u2022 \n\n Only minor spacecraft anomalies occurred, none of which decreased its communica-\ntions capacity A quality product was produced at considerably more money and time than \ninitially anticipated. Development of high-risk technology is seldom produced in less time \nor at a lower cost than planned. The remainder of this paragraph will discuss the primary \nreasons for cost growth, schedule extension, and the attainment of a quality product.  \n\n      Elements of Cost Growth \n      Technical Changes \n From the start, the LeRC project management philosophy was to write the ACTS \ntechnical requirements in terms of general functional capability, without dictating the \n\n\n\n287Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\ndetailed technical approach or changing the technical requirements. This latter philo-\nsophical item meant resisting outside in fl uence to add goodies beyond the original \nscope. By taking this approach, the NASA LeRC project management team hoped to \nensure its integrity (by not trying to get added features for no or little increase in cost). \nThis objective was almost completely accomplished. Over the lifetime of the \n program, the technical scope changes to the development contract resulted in a net \nreduction in cost. \n\n Early in the development program, the contractors suggested (and NASA \nimplemented) technical changes to reduce program costs. These included deleting \na full-up engineering model for the MBA, a spare  fl ight model BBP, and a diver-\nsity earth station. In addition, the base band processor\u2019s downlink burst rate and \ntotal throughput were cut in half and the number of spot beam locations was \nsigni fi cantly reduced. In total, more than $25 M in technical scope was removed \nfrom ACTS.  \n\n      Funding Constraints \n The control of the amount of funding any program receives each year is in the hands \nof the NASA administrator, the federal government administration, and the U.S. \nCongress. The administration\u2019s OMB zeroed out funds for ACTS in its yearly budget \nrequests to Congress in 1985 and 1987\u20131990. Congress was then put in the position \nof reinstating funding for the program over the objection of the administration. This \nprocess frequently resulted in less money being appropriated than originally planned, \nwith a resultant slip in the development schedule and an overall increase in total \nproject costs. The reason that total project costs grew with a stretch-out in funding is \nthat many people (such as project controllers and system engineers) were required to \nremain with the project as long as it was in the development stage. Frequent reassign-\nment of key individuals to other projects, with the loss of their knowledge and owner-\nship, was not practical. \n\n With the large number of subcontractors, the effort to create a new plan after each \nfunding cut also took considerable time and effort (money). \n\n The  fi rst time that funding was zeroed out was in December of 1983, just prior to \nthe planned contract award. As explained in Chap.   1    , \u201cProgram Formulation,\u201d the \nadministration chose to do this when Hughes submitted their  fi ling for their own \nKa-band satellite and claimed that the NASA program was unnecessary (Hughes \nnever followed through and actually built the spacecraft). \n\n This OMB action caused the development contract award to be delayed \n8 months\u2014from December of 1983 until August of 1984. When the funds were \n fi nally reinstated for the project, they were done so at a lower level than the develop-\nment plan required. Worse than the effect of the reduction in funding was probably \nthe impact on contractor personnel. Many of the people who had worked on the \nproposal were no longer available for assignment to the project 8 months later. \nTherefore, new individuals who were not familiar with the project and who could \nnot be held responsible for the proposed development plan had to be assigned. This \nis not the way to start a project! \n\n Fiscal year funding constraints were imposed upon the development program four \ntimes, causing schedule stretch and increases to the total program cost. The total \nproject cost growth due to program stretch-out was $53 M (Figure  9.5 ).  \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3755-0_1\n\n\n288\n\n  Figure 9.5.     Elements of ACTS contractor cost growth as of January 1988. (From \u201cThe \nAdvanced Communications Technology Satellite\u201d book).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n      Overrun \n Contractor overrun was $139 M. The overrun, which occurred mostly during the \nsecond and third years (1986 and 1987) of the development contract, was due primar-\nily to the TRW communication payload subcontract. LeRC project management \nbelieved that one of the main reasons for TRW cost growth was that TRW and their \nsubcontractors underestimated the true development cost in their proposal. Such \nunderestimating has always plagued the government in cost-plus programs, and it \nappeared that ACTS was no exception. This was not totally the fault of the contractor. \nThe contractors knew the government\u2019s target price for ACTS and made sure they \nmet it in their proposals. \n\n Another reason for the TRW overrun is believed to be the low-priority TRW \nplaced upon the program. At the time of the ACTS contract, TRW had many classi fi ed \nprograms that provided them with long-term revenue and pro fi ts. ACTS, being a one-\nof-a-kind spacecraft, appeared to have signi fi cantly lower priority than those built for \nmilitary programs. Few seasoned veteran engineers and managers were assigned by \nTRW to the ACTS project. Having more veteran engineers on the program would \nhave gone a long way toward eliminating many technical and management problems, \nwith a resultant reduction in overrun.   \n\n      The Capped Program \n As the overrun grew, Congressional support for the program started to wane. By late \n1987, it was clear that if the program was to continue, some sure way to limit cost \ngrowth was needed. The choice that satis fi ed Richard Mallow, the chief congressional \nstaffer on the House appropriation committee in charge of NASA\u2019s budget, was to \ncap the total NASA cost for the project. This cap was to apply to all levels, including \nNASA headquarters, NASA LeRC\u2019s project group, and each of the development \ncontractors. All contracts were to be changed from cost-plus into ones that were \ncapped. Mallow desired that the ACTS program be capped at $499 M. \n\n \n\n\n\n289Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n With 3 years of work completed, a lot of the risk associated with the ACTS devel-\nopment was removed or better understood. As a result, the LeRC project management \nfelt that conversion to capped contracts was feasible. At this time, TRW had already \nincurred costs for approximately $153 M, and wanted $72 M more to complete the \npayload under a capped contract\u2014which they were very hesitant to accept (the origi-\nnal contract value for the communication payload was only $106 M). \n\n When all of the costs were received from the contractors for completing the proj-\nect under capped contracts, the total exceeded the $499 M Mallow target. For this \nreason it became necessary to restructure the development team to realize additional \nsavings. The program shifted from a prime contract to two associated contractors. \n\n First, it was decided to drop TRW as the subcontractor for the communications \npayload and have GE AstroSpace complete the payload using TRW\u2019s second-tier \nsubcontractors (GE projected they could  fi nish the payload for $14 M less than \nTRW). The second part of the restructuring was to have NASA LeRC become the \nintegrating contractor, with one contract with GE for the spacecraft and another con-\ntract with COMSAT for the ground segment. This eliminated considerable GE costs \nfor managing the integration of the spacecraft and ground segment activities. Net \nsavings were realized because NASA LeRC was able to perform the integration tasks \nwithout increasing the program staff. \n\n With this shifting of responsibilities, the completion of ACTS development and \n2 years of in-orbit operations became possible within Mallow\u2019s target of $499 M. \nAfter subtraction of the NASA headquarters\u2019 taxes, the total amount of funds avail-\nable to the project of fi ce at NASA LeRC for ACTS development and the  fi rst 2 years \nof operations was $478 M. This amount, however, allowed NASA LeRC to hold only \nseveral million dollars for contingency purposes. \n\n Much of the credit for saving the program must go to Charles Schmidt and the \noriginal RCA AstroSpace team members who were motivated to honor their original \ncommitments and take on considerable risks to complete the payload development \nunder a capped contract. The acceptance of capped contracts by GE, COMSAT, and \nMotorola showed their belief in the value of the ACTS technology. The conversion \nworked. All parties reached agreement in January 1988. In a letter from Senator \nWilliam Proxmire (D-Wisconsin) and Representative Edward P. Boland \n(D-Massachusetts) (chairman, respectively, of the Senate and House Subcommittees \non HUD-Independent Agencies) to James Fletcher, the administrator of NASA, \nCongress agreed to the $499 M cap and provided $76 M for both FY 1989 and 1990. \nFrom that time forward, cost growth concerns lessened and everyone turned to con-\ncentrate on the task of developing a quality product (Figure  9.6 ). \n\n The capping of the program provided some measure of assurance to the develop-\nment team that their funding would stabilize. One year later (in January 1989) how-\never, OMB once again zeroed out the ACTS funding in the administration\u2019s FY 1990 \nbudget request to Congress. Once again the Congress reinstated the funds for ACTS. \nThis was OMB\u2019s  fi nal attempt to cancel the ACTS program.  \n\n      Complexities Associated with a Large Program \n When the development contract was awarded in August of 1984, the contractor \nteam consisted of RCA as the prime, TRW and COMSATas  fi rst-tier subcontractors \nfor the spacecraft communications payload and the ground segment, respectively. \n\n\n\n290\n\n  Figure 9.6.     Breakdown of ACTS $499 M cost cap by organization. (From \u201cThe Advanced \nCommunications Technology Satellite\u201d book).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\nBelow the  fi rst-tier subcontractors, there were approximately 15 major second-tier \nsubcontractors. Some of the second-tier subcontractors\u2014such as Motorola for the \nbase band processor ($46 M), and EMS Technologies Corporation for the beam-\nforming network ($9 M)\u2014were developing high-risk, advanced technology \ncomponents. \n\n For a  fi rst generation system like ACTS, layers of contractors can create major \ncomplications. For instance, TRW was awarded a de fi nitive contract by RCA on \nFebruary 25, 1985. EMS Technologies (a subcontractor for TRW) completed no sub-\nstantive work on the beam-forming network until after it signed a letter contract with \nTRW on April 3, 1985. In August 1985, the ACTS system design review identi fi ed \nthat EMS and TRW could not complete the multibeam antenna system, including the \nBFN, for the allocated budget. To reduce costs, NASA\u2019s LeRC decreased the BFN \nscope as recommended by the contractors. \n\n The rede fi ned contract between TRW and EMS was not signed until July of 1986, \nwhich was almost 2 years after the prime contract was awarded. As the above exam-\nple illustrates, the process of  fi nalizing the requirements and contracts for a new \nsystem can be very complex and time-consuming. The elimination of RCA as the \nprime contractor and TRW as the payload subcontractor went a long way to decrease \nthe high degree of organizational layering (Figure  9.7 ). \n\n The restructuring of the development team in 1988 was certainly a correct step for \nimproved performance. There had been considerable friction between the prime con-\ntractor (RCA),  fi rst-tier subcontractors COMSAT and TRW, and some of the second-\ntier subcontractors, which made problems more dif fi cult to resolve and contributed to \nschedule delays. A committee consisting of executives above the program manager \nlevel from each contractor and NASA was established to resolve top-level issues and \nreduce friction. \n\n\n\n291\n\nSYSTEM DESIGN SYSTEM INTEGRATION\n\nLEWIS RESEARCH CENTER\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\n\nGE LeRC COMSAT\n\nHARRIS\n\nMSFC\n\nMASTER Ka BAND RF\nSTATION\nNETWORK CONTROL STATION\nEXPERIMENTER NETWORK\nOPERATIONS\nSTATION MAINTENANCE\n\nTERRESTRIAL INTERFACE\nEQUIPMENT\n\nH&R LINK EVALUATION\nTERMINAL\n\nSPACECRAFT BUS\n\nSYSTEM INTEGRATION AND\nTEST\nFLIGHT SPACECRAFT\nOPERATIONS\n\nMOTOROLA\n\nLBR-2 GROUND STATION\n\nTOS PERIGREE STAGE\n\nORBITAL SCIENCE CORP\n\nMARTIN MARIETTA\n\nBASEBAND PROCESSOR\nGROUND MODEMS\n\nELECTROMAGNETIC SCIENCES\nBEAM FORMING NETWORKS\n\nWATI0NS-JOHNSON\nTRAVELING WAVE TUBE\nAMPLIFIER\n\nMULTIBEAM COMMUNICATION\nPACKAGE\n\n  Figure 9.7.     ACTS project organization after capping of the program in January of 1988. \n(From \u201cThe Advanced Communications Technology Satellite\u201d book).       \n\nExamples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n Even though it helped, it was not enough. When NASA took over the system \nintegration role and, in effect, became the prime contractor, much of this friction was \neliminated. \n\n In 1988, NASA engineers took over the lead of the working groups (RF, command \nand telemetry, and on-demand network control) that were responsible for coordinat-\ning the interface requirements between the spacecraft and ground system. NASA \npromoted as rapid a technical resolution of problems as possible, and then funded any \nresulting contractual scope changes using its contingency funds. Use of NASA con-\ntingency funds for this purpose went a long way toward improving relations between \nthe  fi nancially pressed contractors. \n\n The approach that LeRC took for managing the ACTS project was to have a strong \ntechnical, cost, and schedule team that could delve closely into all aspects of the \ncontractor activities. The ACTS project organization mirrored that of the contractor \nteam, and monthly performance meetings were held at all major contractor facilities \nincluding those of the principal, second-tier subcontractors. \n\n In addition, NASA project personnel participated in the standard design reviews \nincluding those for all  fi rst- and second-tier subcontractors. \n\n The idea was to have enough in-house knowledge and expertise to perform in-depth \nassessment of all issues, so that the government team could make independent but \npractical decisions, be proactive in solving problems, and help ensure a quality product. \nInitially the government project team did not have all the necessary skills needed \nto accomplish this, but it did by the time of the restructuring and that allowed it to \nassume the role of integrating contractor for the ACTS system. \n\n This role involved more than just managing the spacecraft and ground segment \nintegration. It also included development for more than seven types of user \nterminals. \n\n \n\n\n\n292 Space Program Management\n\n For each of the four times that funding constraints were imposed on the program, \na 6-month process took place where funding cuts were allocated at each contractor \nlevel, new longer schedules and increased contract values were negotiated, and a new \nlaunch date was established. This whole process distracted the development team \nfrom their main tasks and consumed a large number of man-hours. It also gave the \ncontractors an opportunity (it is the government\u2019s management job to make sure it \ndoes not happen) to get well regarding some of their own problems. One of the prac-\ntices for good project management is to never take an action (such as funding cuts) \nthat gives the contractor a reason for failing to meet development schedules. \n\n The impact of funding constraints on a complex development program like ACTS \ncan be disastrous. As bad as those impacts can be (on ACTS they increased the total \ncost by $54 M), top-level government administrators and the U.S. Congress seemed \nto ignore the consequences and just considered funding cuts an inevitable part of \ngenerating a yearly budget.  \n\n      Completion of the Communication Payload \n At the time that the program was capped in January of 1988, the  fl ight base band \nprocessor was 85% completed by Motorola, the  fl ight beam-forming networks were \ndue to be delivered by EMS Technologies 2 months later, and the 20 GHz  fl ight trav-\neling wave tubes were completed and in test at Watkins-Johnson. \n\n In addition, 70% of the TRW  fl ight drawings were released and the engineering \nunit models had completed test. The biggest de fi ciency was with the mechanical \ndesign of the MBA, for which TRW had only completed 35% of the drawings. \n\n The GE approach for completing the payload was to use the completed portions of \nthe TRW design, making only those changes necessary to accommodate the GE \nmanufacturing processes and test procedures or to correct design de fi ciencies. In \naddition, GE decided to use all the parts and material TRW had received. As far as \ncompleting the design of the MBA, GE felt that it was well within the capabilities of \nits engineers. Using this approach, GE forecast that they could complete the payload \nfor almost $14 M less than TRW ($58 M versus $72 M). \n\n This was how the communication payload was completed. It is TRW\u2019s initial \ndesign that was completed and manufactured by GE. To TRW\u2019s credit, they com-\npletely cooperated in the transition of all design documents and material to GE. There \nwere many skeptics who thought GE\u2019s plan would not be successful. But Charles \nSchmidt, head of GE AstroSpace, had con fi dence that his people could pull it off!  \n\n      Major Increases in Scope \n At the start of ACTS development in August of 1984, the spacecraft weight at begin-\nning of life (BOL) in-orbit was estimated to be 2,367 pounds, with 730 pounds of that \ntotal being the communication payload. A margin of 347 pounds was available for \nweight growth as the design matured. In addition, only enough station keeping fuel \nfor 2 years of operations was included (Figure  9.8 ). \n\n With this spacecraft weight, a payload assist module (PAM-A) was to be used to \nplace the ACTS in the proper transfer orbit from shuttle altitude to geostationary \naltitude. \n\n At launch, the  fi nal spacecraft BOL weight was approximately 3,250 pounds, with \n5 years of station keeping fuel and 116 pounds of excess margin. Of this total, the \ncommunication payload weight was 1,295 pounds, including a 33-pound steerable \n\n\n\n293\n\n  Figure 9.8.     ACTS project history\u2014rebaseline/change overview. (From \u201cThe Advanced \nCommunications Technology Satellite\u201d book).       \n\nExamples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\nbeam antenna that was added in 1986. The big increase in payload weight from 1984 \nto 1993 was largely due to changing the antenna re fl ectors\u2019 stowed position during \nlaunch. The original design had the re fl ectors folded across the top of the spacecraft \nto minimize its length. This was changed to include a major truss structure on top of \nthe spacecraft to hold the re fl ectors and beam-forming networks during launch. \n\n To accommodate the 3,250-pound weight, the Orbital Sciences\u2019 Transfer Orbit \nStage (TOS) was used in place of the PAM-A. The TOS stage capability was more \nthan required and it did not carry a full, solid propellant load. The switch to the TOS \nupper stage was made in 1985, with the addition of the laser communications package \n(Lasercom). This package (which was being developed by MIT Lincoln Laboratories \nfor the Air Force), de fi nitely placed the ACTS weight outside the capability of the \nPAM-A booster. \n\n As it turned out, after the addition of the Lasercom and the switch to the TOS was \ncontractually completed, the Lasercom funding was cancelled by the Air Force and \nthe package was deleted in 1987. The combined Lasercom package and TOS change \nwas the largest single scope increase to the contract, amounting to almost $9 M. By \nholding the scope increases to a minimum, NASA helped to contain the project cost \nand risk.   \n\n      Elements of ACTS Schedule Slips \n\n The ACTS contract award was originally planned for December of 1983 with a \nlaunch in July of 1988. The actual launch occurred more than 5 years later on \nSeptember 12, 1993. The combined schedule impacts due to program approval \n\n \n\n\n\n294\n\n  Figure 9.9.     History of launch readiness date (courtesy of Rod Knight, NASA). (From \u201cThe \nAdvanced Communications Technology Satellite\u201d book).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\ndelays, funding constraints, cost overruns, technical dif fi culties, and launch vehicle \navailability were gigantic. The effects of some of these factors will be discussed in \nmore detail in this section (Figure  9.9 ). \n\n      Funding Constraints and Overruns \n A nonadvocate review, headed by Dave Pine of NASA headquarters, evaluated the \nACTS program plan in July of 1982 and concluded that a peak year funding of \napproximately $140 M was required to complete the 55-month development. \n\n When ACTS development was  fi nally started in August of 1984, peak year fund-\ning was planned to occur for two subsequent years at approximately $110 M each \nyear, with a launch 60 months later. The maximum funds allocated to ACTS in any \n1 year were $85 M. With the yearly funding for ACTS always being less than \nrequired, and cost overruns increasing the total amount of funds required, it was \nimpossible to meet the original 60-month development schedule. \n\n In 1986 and 1987 the launch date was slipped 14 and 18 months, respectively. Part \nof the slip that occurred at the end of 1987 was due to the program capping process \nthat took considerable time to accomplish. Therefore, the funding constraints and the \ncost overruns were responsible for 32 months of slippage (projected launch date was \nmoved to May of 1992) (Figure  9.10 ).  \n\n      Technical Dif fi culties \n When the contractor team was restructured in January of 1988, schedule margins \nwere put in place to ensure meeting the new launch date of May 1992. As it turned \nout, the margins were not large enough to accommodate several technical problems \nand a procurement dif fi culty. \n\n\n\n295\n\n150\n\n140\n\n130\n\n120\n\n110\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\nM\nIL\n\nLI\nO\n\nN\nS\n\n O\nF\n\n D\nO\n\nLL\nA\n\nR\nS\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n84 85 86 87 88 89\n\nFISCAL YEARS\n\nPOP 09-1 COOE E 7/02 POP 04-2\n\n90 91 92 93\n\n499.0\nPOP 89-1\n\n365.2\nINITIAL\n\nPOP\n\n474.9\nNON-ADVOCATE REVIEW\n\n94\n\n  Figure 9.10.

The nonadvocate review estimates were \nmade in July 1982 by a group of independent  fi nancial and engineering \nexperts. This group estimated a total program cost of $474.9 M. The initial \nPOP estimates were made by the ACTS project staff at LeRC in the second \nhalf of 1984 and predicted a total cost of $365.2 M. The 89-1 POP estimates \nwere made by the ACTS project staff at LeRC in the  fi rst half of 1989 and \npredicted a total cost of $499 M. This plan which \u201ccapped\u201d the total cost \nusing  fi xed-price contracts was successfully achieved. The costs in the last \n2 years are for operations. Note that the nonadvocate review estimates were \nclose to the  fi nal achieved costs. (From \u201cThe Advanced Communications \nTechnology Satellite\u201d book).       \n\nExamples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n One of the most unexpected impacts was related to the ordering of parts by Astro \nSpace for both the spacecraft bus and the communication payload. \n\n For a spacecraft, part procurements represented a major activity. \n First, NASA required (for quality reasons) that all electronic parts that had not \n\nbeen  fl own before be procured under Class S equivalent standards. For each new part, \nthe procedure required the generation of a requirements document that speci fi ed a \nhigh degree of inspection and testing by the manufacturer to ensure that the part \nwould be reliable for use in space. The requirements document for each new part had \nto be approved by NASA, which added time to the procurement process. \n\n Second, the incorporation of the GE parts ordering system in place at RCA Astro \nSpace (merger of the RCA and GE aerospace units was initiated in 1986) was still \ntaking place and drastically slowed the process. Third, the parts ordering process for \nmany components was not initiated on time due to management mistakes. Even \nthough extra people were assigned to speed up the process, the end result was that the \nassembly of part kits for the manufacturing of electronic boxes and sub-assemblies \n\n \n\n\n\n296\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n83 84\n\n5\n\n20\n\n45\n\n82 85\n77 75 76\n\n20\n\n8 5\n\n85 86\n\n$314 M = 63%\n\nIn\n M\n\nill\nio\n\nn\ns \n\no\nf \n\n$\n\n$185 M = 37%\n\nTotal $499\n\n87 88 89 90 91 92 BTC\n\n  Figure 9.11.     ACTS appropriations by  fi scal year (January 1988). (From \u201cThe Advanced \nCommunications Technology Satellite\u201d book).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\nwas signi fi cantly delayed. It took months to resolve this problem, which completely \neroded schedule contingency (Figure  9.11 ). \n\n A second major schedule hit was due to a problem with one critical electronic part. \nIn any spacecraft program, one of the worst things that can happen is  fi nding a defec-\ntive part after it has been installed in boxes that have completed the lengthy manufac-\nturing/test cycle. This disaster happened to ACTS! \n\n Throughout many electronic boxes in the communication payload, a  fi eld effect \ntransistor (FET) was used in many hermetically sealed ampli fi er modules. The laser-\nwelded hermetic seal prevented unwanted atmospheric gas from entering the modules \nand causing damage by corrosion. After the many boxes that contain this FET had \ncompleted their manufacture/test cycle, it was discovered that the FET\u2019s expected life \nfell well short of the ACTS requirement. \n\n Resolving this problem meant procuring new FETs, disassembling the affected \nboxes, breaking the laser-welded seal, installing the new FETs, and reassembling and \nretesting the boxes (Figure  9.12 ). \n\n Delays with part ordering and the lengthy FET refurbishment, coupled with manu-\nfacturing problems encountered with the MBA were the major contributors to an addi-\ntional 9-month slip in the launch date. This slip, which occurred in early 1991, extended \nthe launch from May of 1992 to February of 1993 and was the fourth one to occur. \n\n The  fi nal launch schedule slips were related to the unavailability of the shuttle. In \nSeptember of 1992, NASA decided to expand the Atlantis shuttle refurbishment \nactivities at Palmdale, California to include the incorporation of a docking capability \nwith the Russian MIR space station. Although ACTS was manifested on Discovery, \nthis caused a ripple effect in the entire shuttle manifest including the rescheduling of \nthe ACTS launch from May of 1993 to July of 1993. \n\n The spacecraft was delivered to NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in February of \n1993 to be mated with the TOS upper stage and begin  fi nal preparations for launch \naboard the shuttle. The  fi rst launch attempt was made on July 17, 1993.

Multiple Satellite Production Programs: Risk and \nOrganizing Principles in the OrbComm Experience \n\n  Written by: David J. Goldstein, Senior Program Manager, Orbcomm Generation 2, \nSierra Nevada Space Systems, Louisville, CO, USA  \n\n The ultimate goal for an aerospace system Program Manager is the successful deliv-\nery of the product in its  fi nal operating state, on time and on schedule. Due to the \ncomplex technology, long duration and high cost of aerospace programs, as well as \n\n \n\n\n\n298\n\n  Figure 9.13.     OrbComm I satellite production line. (Photo courtesy of Orbital Science Corporation).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\nthe inability to repair or replace satellite systems once launched and the likelihood \nthat a failure may be catastrophic, there are a variety of risks to a successful outcome \nthat must constantly be managed and mitigated and indeed can never be completely \nretired. Effective program managers build a management strategy around their \napproach to managing program risk, with various tactics to drive cost, schedule, \ndesign, and organizational management in support of those strategies. By basing the \nmanagement of the system\u2019s development on risk as an organizing principle, techni-\ncal and programmatic elements are better synchronized and reinforce each other \nresulting in an improved program outcome and an improved basis for decision-\nmaking along the way (Figure  9.13 ). \n\n This subchapter focuses on the execution of a production program to build multiple \nsatellites, although many of the principles outlined are applicable to many complex \nspace systems development programs. A number of emerging space applications \nrequire the production of a series of multiple satellites, which in turn require the \nimplementation of a satellite manufacturing line. Commercial LEO communications \nconstellations such as Orbcomm, Globalstar, and Iridium are now replenishing their \nnetworks with their second generation of satellites in quantities ranging from 18 to 48. \nThe Global Positioning System (GPS), Galileo and Glonass are examples of govern-\nment sponsored operational constellations requiring production of dozens of satel-\nlites. Emerging applications in science and imaging call for tens and even hundreds \nof satellites  fl ying in formation to collect simultaneous data points for applications \nsuch as magnetospheric mapping, continuous observation of the Earth\u2019s surface and \nto work together to provide sparse aperture capabilities akin to arrays of cooperative \nimagers in terrestrial applications (Figure  9.14 ). \n\n \n\n\n\n299\n\n  Figure 9.14.

(Photo \ncourtesy of Globalstar Inc.).       \n\nExamples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n Delivering an integrated system is much different from delivering a component, \ndevice, or product. The hallmark of aerospace systems is the tightly integrated nature of \nmultiple instantiations of hardware,  fi rmware, and software subsystems, and the require-\nment for them to perform together in a complex environment semiautonomously. \n\n Therefore, the interactions between intelligent subsystems, many of which are \ncomplex systems in and of themselves, drive the focus and risks of the program into \nthe system integration and test phase. This phase is always more complex than it \nappears due to unexpected interactions or interface issues between all the elements of the \nsystem. Unlike complex subsystem or component programs, which integrate system \nelements (hardware,  fi rmware, software) once, a system-level program piles dozens \nof these complex \u201cintelligent subsystems\u201d together to perform some higher level \nfunction. It is critical that a program manager with a background in a component-\nlevel or product management environment not underestimate the challenges in inte-\ngrating and testing this larger \u201csystem of systems\u201d and the need to be  fl exible and \nresponsive when addressing the unexpected risks or problems which may arise in the \nsystem integration and test phase. \n\n      Managing Multiple Satellite Production by Thinking About Risk \n\n In a multiple satellite build program, it is important to remember that the goal is not \na single  fi nished, working satellite but rather an entire production run deployed on \n\n \n\n\n\n300 Space Program Management\n\norbit. Risks in development of the  fi rst unit of production are multiplied by the full \nnumber of satellites built. Costs in the early stages of the program must be carefully \nmanaged as the budget needs to last not just through the launch of the  fi rst satellite \nbut the launch of the last one. Therefore, thinking about and managing risk as it is \ncarried, transferred, and mitigated throughout the program phases is the key to suc-\ncess in delivering an entire production run of satellites on time, on schedule, and with \nhigh quality and performance. \n\n Multiple satellite programs are distinct in an important manner in that the reliabil-\nity of the overall system is what the ultimate user cares about rather than, strictly \nspeaking, the reliability of any one spacecraft. Especially in small satellite or com-\nmercial constellation programs (a \u201cconstellation\u201d being a network of identical or \nsimilar satellites that together execute a particular application) the random failure of \nany one satellite has a much smaller impact on the overall system than it would if the \nsatellite were standing alone. \n\n On the other hand, design problems or systemic issues can be catastrophic for a \nmultiple satellite mission. A design issue or a repeated workmanship problem that \ncauses failures has a ripple effect across the entire constellation if it affects every \nsatellite in the group, having a very costly impact to the ultimate users of the system. \nExamples are the failures of S-band ampli fi ers on the  fi rst generation Globalstar con-\nstellation starting in 2006 which eventually took their entire global satellite telephony \nsystem out of service, and the attitude control system failures on the series of  fi ve \nOrbcomm Quick Launch satellites lost in 2009. Even lower level failures that cause deg-\nradation and require attention from the ground can have much more severe impacts \nwhen a small Network Operations team must continually monitor the issue in real \ntime in 20, 30 satellites or more.  \n\n      Setting the Level of Acceptable Risk for the Program \n\n One of the  fi rst steps a program manager must take is to understand and translate the \nacceptable level and nature of risk at the start of the program, as this drives a variety \nof program strategies as well as elements such as budget, schedule, technical \napproaches, and the composition of the team. Understanding this level of risk is a chal-\nlenging undertaking and requires not only hard engineering judgment to assess \nrequirements such as design life, reliability, parts requirements or redundancy, but also \nsoft skills to assess reputational risk, the assignment of risk in the contract across vari-\nous parties, and the political and business context surrounding the program. \n\n The \u201crisk posture\u201d of a program is de fi ned as the overall program approach to risk, \nthe acceptable or assumed level of risk characteristic of the program. Typically this \nrisk posture is embedded in the program from the early days of its conception, and is \ncommunicated through the budget and schedule, the requirements, the business model \nif it is a commercial program, the players involved, the process through which the \nprogram became a reality, and dozens of other ways. It is not a \u201chard fact\u201d but rather \nan inferred and implicit understanding amongst the stakeholders set in the early days \nof the program. It is the challenging job of the program manager to correctly assess the \nrisk posture and then communicate it to all the actors on the program, remind the \nstakeholders of it when they act inconsistently, and be sensitive to adjustments and \nchanges in the program\u2019s risk posture if they occur. It is often dif fi cult to state the risk \n\n\n\n301Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\nposture in explicit terms, but a good program manager will translate that risk posture \ninto a consistent decision-making approach that enables the program team and stake-\nholders to understand the actual versus acceptable risk and act accordingly. \n      Hard Indicators of Risk Posture: Program Requirements \n Several hard requirements in the Statement of Work (SOW) and Technical Specifi-\ncation relate directly to the risk posture of the program. Reliability is typically pro-\nvided as a target value per satellite using industry standard reliability calculations. \nThis gives strong insight into the risk posture of the individual satellite, and ideally \n(but rarely) will be coupled with constellation-wide reliability requirement. Design \nlife is another good indicator of risk, as a 3-year mission takes a much different \napproach to risk than a 15- or 18-year mission. \n\n Requirements that drive program execution are often derived from these overarch-\ning lifetime and reliability requirements, and these constraints are often found in the \nformal contract Speci fi cation as well. For example, the level of redundancy required \nin the design may be called out in the contract Speci fi cation. Parts quality constraints \nand manufacturing standards to be observed should be identi fi ed in the Speci fi cation \nas well. Cleanliness, handling, and testing minimums are also often good indications \nof the risk posture of the program. \n\n It is very important for the program manager to identify inconsistencies between \nthe hard indicators of risk such as technical and quality process requirements and \nsofter ones such as budget and schedule. Where there is a mismatch\u2014usually too \nmuch reliability desired for too few dollars or days of program duration\u2014that incon-\nsistency must be identi fi ed, clearly communicated, and resolved immediately. This \nprocess of setting expectations\u2014\u201chere\u2019s what we can do for that amount of money \nand time\u201d\u2014is an essential part of a successful program. In deference to the risk \ninvolved in any aerospace program, it is always best to underpromise and overdeliver, \nas everything takes more time and costs more money than one believes it will in the \nearly days when the plan looks perfect on paper.  \n      Soft Indicators of Risk Posture: Contract, Budget, \nand Program Timeline \n The program contract is a living document, representing a complex negotiation \nbetween human beings with desires, agendas, pressures, and personalities. It embodies \nthe risk posture, values, and agreement between the buyer and the seller of the satellite \nsystem. A complex negotiation preceded the contract, with a complex resolution, and \nthe contract is no more and no less than the physical record of that agreement. It details \nwhat the customer values and where the risk in the program is apportioned\u2014who is \nresponsible for what, and who holds the risk if and when things go wrong. \n\n Understanding the intricacies of the contract gives a deep level of insight into the \narrangement and apportionment of risk across the parties, and therefore how the \nProgram Manager should manage the program. \n\n A sample of questions to consider includes:\n\n   Is it cost-plus or  fi xed price? A cost-plus contract puts the risk of overruns on the \u2022 \ncustomer\u2019s shoulders, whereas a  fi xed price puts it on the vendor.  \n  What are the key program milestones? A program with milestones based on tech-\u2022 \nnical achievements may indicate a desired focus on detailed technical execution, \n\n\n\n302 Space Program Management\n\nwhereas one with on-orbit success criteria may require a focus on schedule and \nmission assurance at the system level.  \n  What sorts of things does the customer seem to care about, based on the  fi nancial \u2022 \nterms of the contract? Performance-based  fi nancial terms (payments per image \ndownloaded or messages transmitted) communicate a much different set of prefer-\nences than those based on reviews or hardware deliveries.  \n  Are there  fi nancial penalties or liquidated damages (damages to be paid out for \u2022 \nmissed milestones or delays), if so, what are they? Many times these penalties are \nlevied on the customer\u2019s most valued elements of the program to provide maxi-\nmum leverage.  \n  If the contract is based on established government contracting principles, are there \u2022 \nany exceptions taken to these clauses? Unusual clauses added or removed? These \ncan indicate a focus on a certain type of risk, or a desire to relax the risk posture \nand take a more aggressive approach to the program.  \n  Is the contract for delivery to the launch pad, or for operation on-orbit? When does \u2022 \nthe ownership of the satellite transfer from the builder to the buyer of the system? \nThese types of clauses in the contract delineate which party is responsible for \nwhich risk elements, and who holds the risk at various phases of the program.    \n\n The program budget and timeline are also good clues to the risk posture of the pro-\ngram, where a tight budget or a very compressed schedule indicate that a more risky \nposture may be acceptable\u2014otherwise the program manager will be unable to deliver \nto that budget or schedule. A contract which calls for an accelerated development \nschedule and minimum cost, while at the same time specifying very high reliability is \nan inconsistency which must be addressed immediately by the program manager. \n\n The importance of not letting these inconsistencies fester, but rather addressing them \nimmediately, cannot be overstated. Mismatched expectations between stakeholders is a \nmajor cause of programmatic and business problems down the road, and it is essential to \nhave the hard discussions early on the program to get everyone aligned on risk and the \nprogram approach, rather than waiting until funds have been spent, negotiating positions \nhardened, and various parties have exposure to risk they did not realize was coming. \n\n Often the Program Manager takes the blame for the problems that ensue. \n In general, the Program Manager must trade performance, cost, and schedule \n\nagainst each other. One can usually deliver a high level of performance of two but not \nall three, although due to the large standing armies of staff on aerospace programs a \ncompressed schedule can sometimes lead to a lower cost (but at the risk of burning \nout staff). Any buyer of a satellite system wants all three, and the Program Manager \nmust identify areas where the trade between the three items is not achievable or only \nachievable at high risk. He or she must bring those issues to light with management \nand ultimately the customer as soon as identi fi ed rather than later in the program, \nwhen the cost to recover from problems is much higher.   \n\n      Integrating Risk into Program Planning \n\n The level of risk set by the program manager should translate into the program \nplan. The level of risk embedded in a satellite system will never drop to zero until \nthe satellite is on-orbit at its end of design life and has met all its requirements at \n\n\n\n303Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\nthat time. However, the program plan should identify the key risks and work to drive \nthem down as early in the program as possible when there is still time and money to \nrecover from unexpected problems and setbacks. \n\n The level of risk expected in the program will drive how the program plan is put \ntogether. A higher risk pro fi le will retain risk in the program until later stages, \nwhich will typically allow an accelerated schedule or a lower program budget, or \nboth. A lower risk pro fi le will attempt to drive down risk early during the design \nphase, as well as implement process constraints that keep risk low in later stages, \nbut at the cost of a longer schedule or higher program cost.  \n\n Low-risk posture  High-risk posture \n\n Extensive supplier quality audits and certi fi cation  Limited supplier oversight and acceptance \ntesting \n\n High QA and documentation requirements  Increased responsibility on individual \nengineers \n\n High levels of hardware and design testing for all \nunits \n\n Workmanship testing only for production \nunits \n\n Rigorous manufacturing requirements on each unit  Requirements met via similarity or heritage \n\n Simulation, analysis, and development of  fl ight-like \ntest hardware during design phase \n\n Simulation and analysis to validate design \napproaches, carrying hardware risk into \nbuild phase \n\n By incorporating risk into program planning, program managers can achieve a \nmore favorable balance between performance, cost, and schedule. \n\n When the program enters production, risks should be beaten down and well \n understood to ensure an uninterrupted production  fl ow, thereby harnessing produc-\ntion ef fi ciencies. In order to do this, it is essential to consider what the highest risk \n elements of the program are based on the conceptual design of the mission. \n\n Then activities should be undertaken to drive down those risks as early in the \nprogram as feasible. If the right activities are prioritized, then those investments can \nidentify issues early and design the implementation of the program to enable a \nsmooth and well understood execution. This will minimize the unexpected setbacks \nthat impact cost and schedule in the later stages of the program when there is less time \nto recover or when the program manager is counting on uninterrupted production \n fl ow to provide cost and schedule ef fi ciencies.  \n\n      Bid and Negotiation \n\n In a well-executed program, the Program Manager is deeply involved in the bid & \nproposal and the contract negotiation phases. These are the phases during which both \nthe soft and hard elements of risk in the contract are established, and the assignments \nof those risks to different players are allocated. It is important to work with the customer \nto talk them through these issues of risk, performance, budget, and schedule, and if \npossible calibrate them to an understanding of the right balance of these issues. \n\n\n\n304 Space Program Management\n\n The proposal needs to embody these points and address the bene fi ts of risk mitigation \nversus competitors who may not have thought it through and are simply claiming the \nlowest cost position. \n\n The contract negotiation is a critical time to manage and set risks, because all \nfuture issues with the customer will be resolved by referencing the level of risk \naccepted by each party in the original contract. All the elements listed above in this \nsubchapter are on the table during the negotiation. \n\n One essential element is carving up the contract into risks that the Program \nManager has the ability to control, and risks that he or she does not. For example, \nlaunch is generally out of the control of the Program Manager of a satellite program. \nIf the launch fails due to a launch vehicle anomaly, there may be payment milestones \nattached to that event such as a payment on launch or on-orbit milestones that will \nnever be achieved. There needs to be some mitigation of that risk in the contract in \ncase of issues that are no fault of the vendor, or some way to cover the cost of insur-\nance on those milestone payments. If these considerations are not made, then the \nvendor is effectively sharing the underlying business risk of the program activity and \nneeds to be compensated for that in some way, perhaps by sharing in the  fi nancial \nreturns of the activity. \n\n In the aerospace business, one risk that can never be transferred to a customer or \nhandled via insurance or some other means is risk to the developer\u2019s reputation. \nThere are a small number of vendors in the aerospace community, and the heritage \nand experience of those vendors is established over decades of program performance. \nNo matter how well the risks and  fi nancial impacts are mitigated in the contract, repu-\ntational risk will remain with the vendor, and some method to control that risk must \nbe retained. These can include agreements to share pre-ship review accountability, \nindependent internal mission assurance activities, and agreements with customers to \ncharacterize risky projects in clear and speci fi c ways in the media and with the larger \naerospace community.  \n\n      Requirements \n\n The start of the program is the requirements de fi nition phase, and for a multiple satellite \nbuild, this phase must take into account not only just the technical performance of \nthe desired satellite but also the requirements for manufacturing and production, and \nthe requirements for operation of multiple satellites simultaneously by the end user. \n\n The requirements de fi ne what the program team must accomplish technically in the \nprogram activity. This combined with the cost and schedule orients the program with \nrespect to the level of risk that is implicitly acceptable during execution. Rigorous \nrequirements with a great deal of process control speak to a low-risk approach, and a \ncommensurately higher budget and longer schedule to execute the program activity. \nA lower level of process controls, lower budget, and short schedule for execution is an \nindicator of a higher tolerance for risk by the ultimate user of the system. \n\n Repeatability is an issue not normally encountered in a single satellite build but \none that is essential to consider for the development of multiple satellites. \n\n The ability to achieve performance requirements in a repeatable way over mul-\ntiple units is an important and unique consideration in a multiple satellite build. \nMany complex components used in a satellite system require extensive tuning or \ncraftsmanship in order to gain the required performance of the device. \n\n\n\n305Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n For a one-off satellite system, this may be an acceptable risk. However, for a mul-\ntiple satellite build, the expected yield of a device or system is important. Expected \nyield is the number of compliant units expected per 100 attempts to build it. A low \nyield process, or one that has a high yield only with a very high cost of tuning and \nretries, can impact a multiple satellite build program in ways that would not impact a \nsingle satellite. This is a risk that is magni fi ed across a multiple satellite build, so \ntherefore one that must be mitigated wherever possible in the requirements phase of \nthe program by limiting requirements that impact the repeatability of the spacecraft \nbuild at a reasonable cost. \n\n Requirements that drive mission operations are another area that merit careful \nexamination in a multiple satellite build. When operating, a satellite network has \nmultiple satellites all being operated by a single team of operators. Therefore, autono-\nmous operations and a well-understood command and control architecture are essen-\ntial. An increased emphasis on documentation and con fi guration management also \nplay into mission operations, where diagnosing anomalies on orbit becomes far more \nchallenging when there are signi fi cant con fi guration differences between satellites \nthat must be tracked. \n\n Additional requirements may be levied on a multiple satellite build that might not \nexist in a one-off satellite build, related to design-for-manufacturability (DFM), \ndesign-for-testability (DFT), and ease of mechanical and electrical access to key \ncomponents and interfaces on the ground to quickly recover in case a rework is \nrequired across multiple units. \n\n DFM considerations may improve the ef fi ciency of assembling multiple satellites in \nan environment where the satellite moves across stations and multiple sub-assemblies \nare integrated and stored en masse for ef fi ciency. DFT considerations are especially \nimportant, including automating test scripts, rapid post-test data analysis, built-in-test \nroutines, and ease of electrical mating and de-mating for test and diagnostic purposes. \n\n In general, the requirements for a multiple satellite mission must be aware of the \nadditional risks and opportunities inherent in a multiple satellite build and take care \nnot to inadvertently drive riskier and more challenging requirements into the program. \nA design engineer or systems engineer not experienced on multiple satellite programs \nmay not be thinking about production or mission operations risks, and therefore the \nprogram manager needs to ensure that these considerations are not forgotten during the \nrequirements phase of the program. This can lead to either budget or schedule overruns \nor a level of risk in the program that may be unacceptable to the user (Figure  9.15 ).  \n\n      Design \n\n A bit of extra thinking during the design phase about the risk pro fi le of the program \nand the nature of a multiple satellite build can build the foundation for either a well-\nconceived program without unnecessary risks or a litany of troubles later in the \nassembly, integration, and test phase. \n\n The same concern about repeatability is critical during this phase. \n The system designers must remember that any challenges or risks inherent in the \n\ndesign will be magni fi ed multiple times throughout the production phase. \n Tight tolerances, complex assemblies, inaccessible areas of the satellite, or unusual \n\nor complex production techniques may be an acceptable risk for one-off programs if \nthe costs and complexities are well understood. \n\n\n\n306\n\n  Figure 9.15.     Orbcomm 1 satellites under test in parallel. (Photo courtesy of Orbital Science \nCorporation).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n However, the multiple satellite system must be designed not only for performance \nbut also for production. \n\n A high performance system with limited thought put into production will drive up \ncosts and schedule later. \n\n More highly skilled personnel will be needed to perform the assembly later in the \nprogram. Workmanship risks carried into testing of production spacecraft will be \nmagni fi ed if the only way to repair them is expensive breaking of con fi guration to get \nto dif fi cult to access areas. A longer schedule will be required to execute complex \nprocesses with low yield at either the component or the system level. \n\n Replacement units will be expensive or even inaccessible if exotic components \nare used. \n\n For a production program, it is helpful to engage the integration and test team in \nthis phase even more than one would for a one-off satellite build. \n\n This is the team that will have to optimize assembly and test, carry production \nrisks, purchase  fi xtures and ground support equipment (GSE), and train a team of \nproduction personnel for the production run. \n\n Their input to the design team is essential to ensure that design decisions are not \nmade that lock the program into high risks or costs for production. \n\n Even seemingly minor considerations such as accessibility of connectors and key \ncomponents via removable side panels can make the difference between a few hours \nof time on the  fl oor or days disassembling, reassembling, and managing the issues \nthat result from breaking con fi guration during test. \n\n Packaging or additional harnessing to access digital interface connectors for \n re-programming FPGAs and other integrated circuits is another element to consider, \n\n\n\n307Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\nso that late design or  fi rmware changes can be integrated into production units \n without a signi fi cant interruption in the production  fl ow. \n\n The Program Manager must drive the integration of DFM and DFT consider-\nations into the design, especially for teams that are not used to taking into account \nthese issues. \n\n One other program element to remember is storage. It is likely that for a multiple \nsatellite program, a number of satellites will be launched together, and therefore the \n fi rst few satellites from that shipset may need to be stored for several months, even \nup to a year. \n\n Accommodation must be made for storage, including suf fi cient storage space and \nground storage equipment so that accidents, leakage, and simply the passage of time \ndo not damage the satellites. Critically, any components that must be highly environ-\nmentally controlled for long periods of storage such as batteries must be designed to \nbe removed easily from the spacecraft so that as much as possible of the satellite can \nremain in an ambient, less rigorously controlled environment. \n\n      Early Hardware Build and Test \n Even during the design phase, certain elements of the program may be identi fi ed as \nhigh risk because they use new components, never-before tried engineering \napproaches, new or questionable suppliers, or internally built subsystems. \n\n In some cases, the performance requirements for the component in this program \ngo beyond the degree to which they were tested and used in the past. Components \nbuilt rather than purchased are especially risky, as they are often the result of a buy-\nbuild decision that was not able to identify an adequate market solution. In this case \nit is important not to miss the message the market has given, that this component may \nnot exist because of the dif fi culty and cost in its realization, and thereby underesti-\nmate the complexity or risks of building it in-house. Often the satellite payload is a \nnew or not previously built system that presents signi fi cant risk. \n\n These risks should be identi fi ed early in the design phase and work done to build \nand test prototypes and to buy down risk in the early stages of the program. Above \nall, effort should be taken to set milestones related to risk reduction and push towards \nthose milestones with the same aggressiveness early in the program as one would \nwhen nearing launch.   \n\n      Supplier Selection and Management \n\n In a multiple satellite build, the program manager is truly building and maintaining a \nsupply chain that must serve the program for large number of unit builds. \n\n He or she must invest in and tend to the supply chain to keep it healthy and intact \nover time. A small niche provider may be great at delivering a custom device, or offer \na very low cost, but can they build 20 or 40 or 80 of them in a repeatable, consistent \nmanner over an extended period of time, often years? An offshore provider may offer \na great price, but at what long-term risks in terms of language, quality, or regulatory \nissues and delays? \n\n A production run of a satellite system requires a similar production run of a variety \nof components and subsystems. In quantity, documentation and processes are more \nimportant than they might be with a one-off build. Each device needs to be built and \n\n\n\n308 Space Program Management\n\ntested to the same standards for the  fi rst unit and for the last, so that the integrity of \nthe production process at the system level is maintained. A consistent, repeatable \nprocess must be followed by the vendor. \n\n Rigorous tracking of nonconformances, deviations, engineering design changes, etc. \nmust be maintained and documented so that when the units are integrated into production \nsatellites they can be managed by the production team and issues quickly identi fi ed. \n\n Remember the goal is a production line, not \u2018 n \u2019 number of custom satellites. \n If every component is different, every satellite will be different as well. \n Early in the program, the Program Manager must set these expectations for their \n\nsuppliers with visits and clear contract language. Even for experienced suppliers, a \nquality assurance visit early in the program and at least one visit to witness Acceptance \nTesting is important to at a minimum send a strong signal to supplier management \nthat quality assurance and repeatability is important to the program. This becomes \neven more important with riskier or less proven suppliers in the chain. \n\n The ability to purchase additional units later in the program, even years later, is \nanother important consideration. \n\n There will always be obsolescence in a design, but the goal is to limit signi fi cant \ndesign changes in follow-on purchases of production spacecraft or the need to change \nsuppliers which will usually imply signi fi cant redesign. \n\n A supplier with a track record of longevity that provides products that are not in \nthe  fi nal days of their availability to the market will reduce long-term risk to the pro-\ngram, although usually not without a cost. In cases where a vendor presents these \ntypes of risks but offers signi fi cant cost, schedule or performance bene fi ts, the ulti-\nmate customer can often be consulted to get their consensus and at least share the risk \nof any problems that may surface later. \n\n In some cases the supplier of the best component may lack some of the rigor \nneeded to properly execute the production build. In these cases, the program manager \nshould consider investing in the supplier\u2019s quality systems and production capabili-\nties via training, on-site visits, etc. Remember that when building a supply chain, the \nprogram manager is a partner with the suppliers and that one aspect of the manage-\nment job is to build, support, invest in, and nourish the supply chain so that it delivers \nwhat is needed over the long term. \n\n One way to think about the supply chain is as a repeated game. In a one-time \ngame, there is less of an incentive to invest in suppliers, negotiate, and support their \nlong-term health. \n\n A multiple satellite build has a long-term, repeated element to the business interac-\ntions between parties. Investments in suppliers in a multiyear, multisatellite program \ncan deliver great returns down the road. \n\n This is even more important in a cost-constrained or higher risk environment, \nwhere the resources to deal with a problem supplier when it is too late to make a \nchange in design or component may not be available.  \n\n      First Unit Assembly, Integration and Test \n\n One key element of a multiple satellite program is the need to reduce overall costs by \nbuilding the majority of the satellites in a production environment rather than crafting \neach individual unit the way that a team might craft a single satellite for a focused \nscience or other one-off mission. \n\n\n\n309\n\n  Figure 9.16.

(Image courtesy of \nSierra Nevada Space Systems).       \n\nExamples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n Therefore, a  fi rst unit should be developed with a higher and more detailed level \nof testing and veri fi cation in order to prove the integrity of the design. Later builds \non the manufacturing  fl oor might only focus on workmanship risks and where pos-\nsible assume that design risks have been retired by the  fi rst unit. \n\n Obviously, process repeatability and consistency in parts and components across \nunits is essential to this approach of retiring design risk on the  fi rst unit and then \nrepeating that build with more limited testing across the rest of the constellation. \n\n If there is not a strong level of con fi dence within the program team as well as with \nthe customer that later units can be proven to meet requirements by similarity to the \n fi rst proto-tested units, then this approach breaks down as does many of the promised \nef fi ciencies of production. \n\n      Design Veri fi cation and Proto-Flight \n The  fi rst satellite built in the production series embodies the  fi rst ever instantiation of \nthe design and the combination of subsystems and components that makes up the \noverall system. \n\n As such, it is the testbed to validate the system design and observe how all the \nparts work together as a system for the  fi rst time. \n\n The goal of the  fi rst unit should be to retire as much risk as possible from the \nproduction run. The production run, on the other hand, should be focused on lean, \nef fi cient, low risk manufacturing (Figure  9.16 ). \n\n One distinction that the Program Manager and the program team must determine \nis between Design Veri fi cation Tests (DVTs) and Workmanship veri fi cation tests. \n\n The distinction hinges on whether or not a particular feature or requirement can be \nreliably trusted to be replicated across the entire production run without verifying it \non each unit produced. \n\n \n\n\n\n310 Space Program Management\n\n An example is certain software features\u2014with proper con fi guration control, there \nis no reason to believe that a particular software logic queue or telemetry point would \nvary from production unit to production unit. \n\n On the other hand, the integrity of soldering joints, the proper mating of connectors, \nor the proper torquing of structurally critical bolts needs to be veri fi ed on each unit. \nThese are workmanship and not DVTs. \n\n In general, for a multiple satellite program, the  fi rst unit should undergo an exhaus-\ntive test program to validate both workmanship and design, clearing the way for \nfuture satellites on the line to undergo a more limited program. \n\n The test suites on the  fi rst unit should not only be broader but also deeper\u2014for \nexample, the  fi rst unit might undergo proto- fl ight levels of vibration testing, 3 dB \nhigher than any other spacecraft sees, to validate the design margin without stressing \neach production unit to a similar level. \n\n Good documentation of the proto- fl ight  fi rst unit tests are essential, as they will \nform the basis for claiming compliance with requirements for all later units by \nsimilarity.   \n\n      Transition to Production \n\n The transition phase is an important phase of the program between proto- fl ight test of \nthe  fi rst unit and moving to a production line for the remaining units in the lot. \n\n While signi fi cant planning may have been done for production in the early stages \nof the program, there will be a number of lessons learned from development of the \n fi rst spacecraft that must be integrated into the production planning. \n\n Test procedures and processes will have been developed, dif fi cult issues identi fi ed \nand solutions proven, unknown risks uncovered, and some level of reality will be \nplaced on the duration and cost of various tasks. \n\n All this discovered knowledge can now be applied to the \u201cdelta\u201d planning for \nproduction and the development of tools for it. \n\n During development of the  fi rst unit, it is inevitable that some activities were \n performed manually and the degree of automation must be increased to hit the cost \nand schedule goals of the production run. \n\n During this transition phase, the program team should scrub the production test \nprogram, described below, for opportunities to automate testing or cut out redun-\ndant tests. \n\n The plan for production lines must also be reviewed. \n New or critical pieces of GSE that were not previously considered need to be \n\nidenti fi ed and procured. \n One critical lesson learned is to invest in GSE, which impacts the budget of a \n\nprogram manager but makes a huge difference in terms of keeping production lines \ngoing during equipment outages and keeping the standing army of staff, the highest \ncost for a satellite program, active and at maximum ef fi ciency. \n\n Depending on the number of parallel production lines envisioned, a plan for phas-\ning the various satellites through that line and the equipment needed including sched-\nuling for critical items such as thermal vacuum chambers and vibration tables needs \nto be built. Special Test Equipment (STE) needs to be identi fi ed early, and spares built \n\n\n\n311Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\nif appropriate to ensure that a line does not go down and imperil the program schedule \nby potentially months. \n\n This is also the time to assess design risks that were not addressed by the  fi rst unit \nas envisioned in the plan. \n\n There may be system designs or components that did not work as expected where \nsome level of risk is being carried into the production run. \n\n A careful assessment of these needs to be undertaken, as any deviation from the \n fi rst unit imperils the ability to prove DVTs by similarity. \n\n However, in some cases, the design simply did not work when implemented on the \n fi rst unit. Some work-around may have been found, and during this transition a care-\nful examination of whether to redesign to remove risk or to simply use the work-\naround on the production units needs to be undertaken. \n\n In general, doing it \u201cright\u201d is less risky than the work-around option, due to the \nmultiple unit nature of the production run and the likelihood that problems will be \nmagni fi ed in production. However, this is not always the case\u2014there is also a risk of \ndoing something new in production and that must be weighed carefully. \n\n The timing of this transition to production is an important factor\u2014the earlier the \ntransition, the more open risks or questions there may be that interrupt or derail pro-\nduction; the later the transition, the lower the design risk for production but the longer \nthe schedule and cost. \n\n This is a critical decision point for the program plan, and where possible as many \ndecisions from which there are \u201cno return\u201d should be delayed until risk has been \nbeaten down. \n\n Critical milestones such as burning one-time-programmable FPGA\u2019s or closing up \nand sealing inaccessible areas of the  fi rst few production units should be held off as \nlate as possible, within reason, to allow design veri fi cation to be undertaken on the \n fi rst few proto- fl ight units (Figure  9.17 ). \n\n The risk pro fi le of the program goes down over time. The earlier the transition to \nproduction, the higher risk during the early phases of production and the more budget \nand schedule margin that should be assigned to the program plan. On the other hand, \nthe later the transition, the longer the known schedule and higher the \u201cknown\u201d budget \nwill be. Finding the right balance among these factors is one of the key challenges \nfaced by the Program Manager of a multiple satellite program.  \n\n      Production \n\n By the time production begins, most risks should have been eliminated such that there \nis a low level of engineering risk and design risk in the program. \n\n DVTs should have proven the design, and the  fi rst unit will hopefully have moved \nthrough a complete system integration and test program to conclusion, retiring most \nif not all design risk and qualifying the design with margin to proto- fl ight levels. At \nthis point, the test program can be cut down to address the remaining risks\u2014namely, \nmanufacturing and production. \n\n Opinions differ on how many production satellites must be completed before the \nmajority of issues that will be seen and lessons learned have been integrated into the \nprogram. However, there is a general consensus that the program will reach this point \nbetween the fourth and the sixth units on the line. \n\n\n\n312\n\nHigh Risk\n\nDesign\n\nDesign\n\nRisk Reduction HW\n\nRisk Reduction HW\n\nComponent Procurement\n\nTransition\n\nTransition\n\nProduction\n\nProduction\n\nComponent Procurement\n\nProto?flight Build\n\nProto?flight Build\n\nLower Risk\n\nRisk over time\n\n  Figure 9.17.     Risk scheduling. A transition to production earlier in the program carries \nhigher risk into the production phase, but also can shorten the overall sched-\nule for the program if the calculated risk pays off.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n The  fi rst few production units will need more  fl oor time to \u201cget it right\u201d than \nlater units. \n\n There may be a small remaining set of DVTs to validate any design changes or \nmodi fi cation since the  fi rst unit, and these need to be built into the  fi rst few production \nunits. Production processes are being tested and validated. \n\n Furthermore, the full array of potential \u201ccommon\u201d issues are unlikely to have \nsurfaced on only the  fi rst or second spacecraft\u2014it takes running several through the \nprocess before the majority of issues that will emerge throughout the production line \nare witnessed and mitigation is built into the production process. \n\n A production environment is geared to a set of repeatable manufacturing, assembly, \nintegration and test processes that allow highly ef fi cient manufacturing in a way that \npreserves the validity of the DVTs performed on the  fi rst unit in all subsequent units. \n\n This requires a high level of repeatability in the production line and a set of docu-\nmentation and process tools that ensures this repeatability. \n\n Good QA, documentation, and nonconformance tracking are even more important \nin multiple production builds, as problems discovered on one system may have impli-\ncations for all the satellites in the production run (\u201ceffectivity\u201d impacts) and those \neffectivity implications need to be tracked and corrections veri fi ed across the produc-\ntion run to avoid systemic failures. \n\n There are a set of risks that cannot be retired on each unit, related to workmanship \nand any design elements that are dif fi cult to repeat. These risks must be tested for and \neliminated on a unit-by-unit basis. \n\n \n\n\n\n313\n\n  Figure 9.18.     Orbcomm-2 satellite in preparation for RF testing. (Photo courtesy of Sierra \nNevada Space Systems).       \n\nExamples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n Component-level testing is essential to screen components, many of which will be \nbuilt by different manufacturers with differing processes and quality standards. \n\n At the system level, functional testing should be designed to check every copper \npath on the spacecraft. These are elements that can be affected by workmanship \nissues and errors. Vibration testing allows a good check of workmanship quality, as \ndoes thermal vacuum testing which stresses solder joints and the integrity of thermal \npathways. \n\n However, many DVT tests such as mission simulations can be skipped in later \nspacecraft\u2014the software logic and overall spacecraft design have been veri fi ed by the \n fi rst unit, so now the critical questions are:\n\n   Is the spacecraft design the same as one that has been fully tested at the DVT level?   \u2013\n  Is the workmanship quality of the spacecraft good, so the design has been properly  \u2013\nimplemented on this unit?    \n\n The importance of repeatability and similarity between units cannot be overem-\nphasized\u2014it is the cornerstone of the production process. \n\n Do not underestimate the impact of a \u201csmall design change\u201d on the ef fi ciencies of \nproduction. Any change in mission design, system engineering budgets, etc. may \ninvalidate dozens of DVTs and require either extensive retesting or the assumption of \nincreased risk for those affected systems (Figure  9.18 ).  \n\n      Launch and On-Orbit Support \n\n Mission operations are also unique for multiple satellite missions\u2014mostly because \nthere are often several satellites being launched simultaneously. \n\n This means that a reasonably sized team with access to a limited number of ground \nstations cannot immediately control and operate all the satellites being launched. \n\n It is essential that the satellites have a highly reliable, autonomous safe mode \nand that the team has developed a mission operations plan that allow each satellite to \nbe placed into a safe mode to await its turn for initialization. This way the mission \noperations team can \u201cpark\u201d the satellites and address each one in sequence. \n\n Once deployed and operating on-orbit, it is essential to create a baseline reference \nfor each spacecraft to catalog the differences and unique issues of each. In this manner, \nan on-orbit anomaly in one unit can be quickly diagnosed and addressed. \n\n \n\n\n\n314 Space Program Management\n\n A high level of automation in this process is ideal in order to enable easier \noperations by a small team which otherwise will have to remember the peculiar \nrequirements and capabilities characteristic of each element of the constellation. \nNotwithstanding these operational adaptations, the importance of minimizing any \ndifferences between satellites is apparent when considering the operation of 20, 30, \nor more spacecraft simultaneously. \n\n It is important early in the program to design an approach to \u201ctest as you  fl y\u201d\u2014using \nthe same version and implementation of  fl ight control software that will be used on orbit \nat the satellite integrator, the bus provider, and the payload provider for testing. \n\n This way at every step operational risk is being reduced, rather than realizing late \nin the program that there is a disjointed requirements veri fi cation plan that veri fi es \nrequirements but possibly not in the manner they will be used on orbit, which intro-\nduces further risks.  \n\n      Con fi guration Creep and Introduction of New Products \n\n Inherent in the concept of repeatability is the concept of \u201csameness.\u201d \n Where any spacecraft design deviates from the base con fi guration, an additional \n\ncomplexity is introduced. \n This may not be immediately apparent\u2014perhaps the requirements are relaxed for \n\nthe  fi rst few spacecraft for schedule reasons, or some additional feature is added to a \nset of spacecraft to accommodate a new insertion orbit or launch vehicle. \n\n These may seem at  fi rst like changes that have a limited impact or even make the \nprogram simpler\u2014relaxing requirements would reduce costs in a single spacecraft \nenvironment. \n\n In a multiple satellite build program, ef fi ciencies are gained by the number of \nidentical systems run off the production line. \n\n Therefore, any deviation from the base con fi guration is a new product that needs \nto be supported. With this new product comes a new set of DVTs and a breakdown \nin the similarity between units that allow a reduced level of testing in the production \nenvironment.  \n\n      Team Composition and Organization \n\n A multiple satellite build program has more program stages than a typical one-off \ndevelopment activity. The production phase looms large and that must be taken into \naccount in the staf fi ng plan for the program. \n\n In general, a one-off small satellite program uses the same core team to design, \nbuild, and test the system, with some exceptions. \n\n This can be done with a multiple satellite production program, but many \nef fi ciencies are dif fi cult to achieve in this scenario. \n\n In an ideal situation, the program transitions from an engineering to a production \nenvironment around the fourth to sixth unit to come off the production line. \n\n The majority of the team at this point may be comprised of I&T technicians and \nengineers, with a lower cost basis than the earlier team composed of design engineers \nand mission architects. \n\n\n\n315Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n It is important to have a plan for the design team to transition, otherwise it will be \ndif fi cult to effect the transition successfully. \n\n The production team should be well organized and integrated with the design team \nin the early stage of the program to make the transition seamless. \n\n They will require signi fi cant training and familiarization with the design so that \ntesting and problem resolution can be performed smoothly and with an understanding \nof the intricacies of the design. \n\n The temptation to use engineers who \u201cknow the system well\u201d should be resisted, \nand the program should early on transfer test knowledge to test technicians and opera-\ntors who will support the program through production.  \n\n      Schedule Management \n\n The program is fundamentally split into a  fi rst article effort and a production effort. \n In the production effort, it is critical to manage schedule tightly. \n An elongated schedule with delays in a given spacecraft has spill-over effects on \n\nthe other production units to follow. \n This in turn can have signi fi cant budget implications to keep the staff on the pro-\n\ngram longer, as well as launch implications as launch readiness is dependent on \nmultiple satellites being ready to  fl y. \n\n While during the  fi rst article DVT phase getting it \u201cright\u201d and pushing down risk is \nkey, during the production phase it is critical to remain on schedule and not to be \u201cpenny-\nwise, pound foolish\u201d and try to save money in ways that elongate the production sched-\nule and keep the standing army of staff and resources engaged longer than necessary.   \n\n    9.3.   Management of Medium-Sized US Space Programs for DoD \n\n  Written by Pat Remias, Senior Director of programs, Spacecraft Systems, Sierra \nNevada Corporation, Space Systems Group, Luisville, CO, USA  \n\n To characterize the programs in this chapter as \u201cmid-sized\u201d is essentially compara-\ntive, as many would consider them to be small programs relative to the multibillion \ndollar space capabilities that are still the norm in many government and international \nmarkets. \n\n However, they are distinct from the small programs discussed in the section on \nmicrospacecraft in so many respects that they constitute a mission class distinct from \nboth extremes. \n\n Medium-sized space programs are de fi ned in this chapter to be single- or multiple-\nspacecraft development programs with total contract values in the range US \n$50\u2013$150 M. \n\n This value includes the total integrated spacecraft and payload, but typically does \nnot include launch. \n\n For US Government customers, applications are often technology demonstration \nor path fi nding missions, with lifetimes in the 5-year or less range. \n\n Total mass is typically 500 kg or less to enable launch on small launchers or as \nsecondary payloads, and the architectures are typically single-string with some \n\n\n\n316 Space Program Management\n\nredundancy targeted at mission critical items. The customer often acts as overall \nmission integrator, and separately procures the instrument(s) or payloads, space-\ncraft bus, launcher, and mission operations capability. \n\n The customer may contract the bus provider to integrate the instruments/payloads, \nor may perform that integration in-house with contractor support. \n\n While still generally labeled \u201csmall satellites,\u201d and often launched as secondary \npayloads or as multiple payloads on larger launch vehicles, a mid-sized program\u2019s level \nof technical, organizational, and contractual complexity drives an approach to program \nmanagement that is more formalized than discussed in the chapter on microsatellites. \n\n While some of the practices characteristic of very small programs may be adapted \nto these larger programs, customer requirements and sometimes unwritten expecta-\ntions, as well as the sheer size and number of people and of teams involved, drive \ndifferent management methodologies while still striving for the overall goal of main-\ntaining the high ef fi ciency and low cost that make smaller missions attractive. \n\n Many missions in this category are conducted by the US DOD\u2019s Space Test \nProgram (STP) Of fi ce located at Kirtland Air Force Base, NASA\u2019s Small Explorer \n(SMEX) missions, plus agency-speci fi c missions like the TacSats developed for the \nOperationally Responsive Space (ORS) Of fi ce, and the Joint Milliarcsecond \nPath fi nder Survey (JMAPS) mission sponsored by the US Navy. Commercial exam-\nples include the ongoing Orbcomm second-generation spacecraft program and many \nprivately developed commercial remote-sensing missions. \n\n Every program is unique, but the management approaches discussed herein apply \nthroughout the category. Government agencies which employ this approach include \nthe Naval Research Laboratory (NRL, Washington, DC), and the NASA Ames \nResearch Center, as both have a history of developing this class of system. Contractors \nwith proven track records of success using this kind of management approach include \nOrbital Sciences Corporation, Ball Aerospace, and Sierra Nevada Corporation. \n\n      Organizing the Work Breakdown Structure \n\n Once the space mission\u2019s top-level objectives are de fi ned, the next major step in the \nmanagement process is generation of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), which \nde fi nes the top-level elements that comprise the program. For US Government pro-\ngrams, the primary reference document for de fi ning WBS structures is MIL-HDBK-\n881A,  WBS Structures for Defense Materiel Items , particularly  Appendix F: Space \nSystems  (  http://www.acq.osd.mil/pm/currentpolicy/wbs/MIL_HDBK881A/\nMILHDBK881A/WebHelp3/MILHDBK881A.htm    ). \n\n Per that document, the WBS \u201cprovides a consistent and visible framework for \ndefense materiel items and contracts within a program.\u201d \n\n The WBS is a product-focused structure for organizing and de fi ning the work \nassociated with a Mission or Contract. It lists every major deliverable element of a \nprogram, with those major elements divided into sub-elements. \n\n The elements, sub-elements, and products within those sub-elements are assigned \na hierarchical code. \n\n The corresponding document to the WBS is the WBS Dictionary, which clearly \nexplains the products, activities, tasks, and/or deliverables for every line item of \nthe WBS. \n\nhttp://www.acq.osd.mil/pm/currentpolicy/wbs/MIL_HDBK881A/MILHDBK881A/WebHelp3/MILHDBK881A.htm\nhttp://www.acq.osd.mil/pm/currentpolicy/wbs/MIL_HDBK881A/MILHDBK881A/WebHelp3/MILHDBK881A.htm\n\n\n317\n\nLEVEL \n\n1\n\nLEVEL \n\n2\n\nLEVEL \n\n3\n\nLEVEL \n\n4\n\nSpace System\n\nLaunch\nIntegration\n\nPayload(s)Bus(es)\n\nPre-Launch \nWorking Groups\n\nPayload \nSub-Elements\n\nStructures and\nMechanisms\n\nStructures and\nMechanisms\n\nThermal\n\nElectrical Power\n\nAttitude Control\n\nPropulsion\n\nTelemetry,\nTracking and\n\nCommand\n\nSC Bus Flight\nSoftware\n\nOnsite LV\nIntegration \n\nSupport\n\nInitial On-Orbit\nCheckout\n\nPost-Checkout\nMission Support\n\nEngineering\nStudies and\n\n Analysis\n\nLaunch Ops &\nMission Support\n\nGround Launch VehicleSpace Vehicle\n\nThis WBS example illustrates a typical space mission product hierarchy, with Level 4 detail provided for the space vehicle.\n\n  Figure 9.19.    WBS example.       \n\nExamples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n If the WBS structure is not explicitly dictated by the customer, a contractor may \nutilize its own WBS to capture and organize the work required by the contract. \n\n Many organizations have created their own \u201cstandard\u201d WBS structure, which they \nuse repeatedly on similar programs\u2014enabling them to compare the dollars required \nto accomplish speci fi c tasks from one program to the next. \n\n This is particularly useful when proposing new work; referring back to a previous \nsimilar program with a direct comparison of similar work is by far the preferred \njusti fi cation for any Basis of Estimate (BOE) (Figure  9.19 ). \n\n The WBS ultimately provides the basis for the complete integrated Cost, Schedule, \nand Technical Performance reporting system as well as Risk Management. \n\n All other management elements should clearly link to the WBS, including the \nIntegrated Master Schedule and Integrated Management Plan (IMS/IMP) and the \nEarned Value reporting structure. The IMS, ideally, replicates the WBS structure and \nassigns durations to each lowest-level task or activity, which again roll up to support \ndelivery of major program items, assigns resources to those tasks, identi fi es depen-\ndencies between the tasks, and links them to major program milestones. \n\n A program-level IMS will also identify \u201cgiver/receiver\u201d items\u2014for example, if \nthe bus supplier needs a payload simulator in order to complete software development \nand verify electrical interfaces, the payload provider would be the \u201cgiver\u201d of that \nsimulator at the necessary point in the schedule, while the bus contractor would be \nthe \u201creceiver.\u201d \n\n It is critical to clearly identify these relationships where they exist, with clear \nexpectations of schedule between the parties. \n\n \n\n\n\n318\n\nSOW\nSpacecraft Bus Contract\n\n1.

The contract SoW.       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n There are typically three major elements of a space mission\u2014the Space Segment \n[with one or more space vehicles comprised of Bus(es) and Payload(s)], the Launch \nVehicle (LV), and the Ground Segment which accomplishes all mission operations \nfunctions. Each one of these elements may be separately contracted, each with their \nown supporting Contract WBS. Once the program WBS is developed and an acquisi-\ntion strategy is  fi nalized, attention shifts to development of the Statements of Work \n(SOWs).  \n\n      Schemes for the Statement of Work \n\n The SOW for the Space Segment de fi nes the scope of work to be performed under \nthe contract effort, and clearly de fi nes the end products\u2014normally an integrated \nspacecraft or multiples of that vehicle and associated analyses and documentation, \nplus all required support activities including launch support and on-orbit support. \n\n It is one key document that is typically part of a complete RFP that is issued by \na customer, and the one that most clearly de fi nes the management requirements for \na given program. In mid-sized programs, particularly those acquired using US gov-\nernment \u201cacquisition-reform\u201d principles, the SOW is often under 50 pages and \nstrives to de fi ne key deliverables without unnecessarily overde fi ning the processes \nused to create them (Figure  9.20 ). \n\n As in smaller programs, a SOW (and other RFP documents) is ideally the result of \na close collaboration between the customer and the contractor community. \n\n \n\n\n\n319Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n This collaboration is usually accomplished by a series of Brie fi ngs for Industry \n(BFIs) and customer Requests for Information (RFIs), where contractors respond \nwith information to help structure the program contractual approach and technical \nrequirements, and/or customer releases of draft RFP documents prior to the  fi nal \nRFP\u2014either to the entire community or to a set of contractors who have indicated an \ninterest in bidding. \n\n A winning strategy always includes responding to these opportunities to create a \nprogram scenario that is favorable to your solution and to acquaint the customer with \nthe key and novel elements of the solution to be proposed. After award selection, but \nprior to  fi nal contract signing, other changes to the SOW may be negotiated between \ncustomer and contractor to meet the target price and establish the program baseline. \n\n It is critical that all parties have a clear understanding of the scope of work for any \nprogram, and that general terms like \u201claunch support\u201d or \u201cmission operations sup-\nport\u201d are clearly de fi ned\u2014by some combination of schedule, headcount, and/or \nassociated speci fi c tasks. At a minimum, the contractor must be very speci fi c about \nwhat was assumed and bid in the original proposal, so that any future scope changes \nare not subject to debate.  \n\n      Referenced Documents \n\n A SOW may provide a list of both compliance documents and reference documents, \nusually comprised of MIL-STDs, Handbooks, NASA or ESA standards, or similar \ndocuments. \n\n These documents de fi ne technical and managerial paradigms for tasks like envi-\nronmental testing, safety, reliability, parts quality, failure analyses, and a huge variety \nof other related space processes. \n\n In a mid-sized class of program, the goal is to ruthlessly minimize the number of \ntrue compliance documents (or at least agree to negotiate their extent and content to \na level appropriate to the program complexity), and instead provide that documenta-\ntion list strictly as guidelines or references\u2014and even then, severely limit it to only \nthose that are most critical to achieving program goals. \n\n In general, the more referenced documents in the SOW, the higher the program \ncost, as even the process of reviewing the list and determining appropriate tailoring \nis time- and resource-intensive. The philosophy for how rigorously these documents \nare applied is one of the key paradigms to establish between customer and contractor \nin the program, as there can be large and often unrecognized differences in expecta-\ntions between organizations. \n\n What is \u201ctypical\u201d for one organization may be considered completely out-of-scope \nby another.  \n\n      Applying Earned Value Management \n\n If a US government contract exceeds $20 M in value, the contractor is required to \nutilize an earned value management system (EVMS) to baseline and track program \nprogress. \n\n Waivers to this requirement are possible but dif fi cult to obtain. \n\n\n\n320\n\n  Figure 9.21.     Earned value methodologies provide a quantitative measure of program \nprogress, and are uniformly applied to mid-sized Government space programs. \n(courtesy from Jim Ramsey, PCI Systems formerly AeroAstro).       \n\nSpace Program Management\n\n As with any program tracking system, the \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d rule \napplies\u2014without a solid program baseline (cost, schedule, performance metrics) to \ntrack against, and the input of meaningful, relevant monthly data in the correct struc-\nture and format, the resulting reports are almost meaningless and can be no more \nthan a waste of time and money for all parties. \n\n In an earned value management application to a program, the WBS structure again \nforms the basis and structure for establishing a program baseline and tracking \n progress against it\u2014providing a quantitative method for determining if the various \nelements that form a program are performing as expected. \n\n This process occurs by accomplishing work that has speci fi c dollar value associ-\nated with it, and comparing that against the \u201cplan,\u201d or program cost baseline, on a \nregular basis, normally monthly. Variances between work that has been performed \nversus the baseline plan are identi fi ed and discussed in monthly reports; large vari-\nances are generally undesirable and the customer expects the contractor to take action \nto correct them. \n\n A simplistic example of this principle, including the calculation of Schedule and \nCost Variances, is provided in Figure  9.21 . \n\n The level at which variances are reported against the plan is typically at the \n\u201cControl Account\u201d level, while actual charge numbers are normally assigned one \nlevel below that, the \u201cWork Package\u201d level. \n\n A key tenet of EVM is the delegation of budget authority to the Control Account \nManagers, who are responsible for managing their Control Accounts\u2014essentially a \nmini-program within a program. Engineers are often assigned as Control Account \nmanagers, and staff training is essential if the organization or team lacks experience. \n\n The DoD\u2019s top-level implementation guide for EVMS can be found at   http://\nguidebook.dcma.mil/79/EVMIG.doc    , though there are a myriad of related docu-\nments, web sites, and companies who specialize in applying EVM and training your \nstaff in its application. \n\n \n\nhttp://guidebook.dcma.mil/79/EVMIG.doc\nhttp://guidebook.dcma.mil/79/EVMIG.doc\n\n\n321Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n Many mid-sized programs attempt an \u201cEV-Lite\u201d approach to earned value, where \nthe number of Control Accounts and Work Packages is kept relatively small, and they \nare organized to minimize management cost and overhead while still providing mean-\ningful data that can be used to identify and tackle program risk areas. \n\n Keep in mind that the purpose of an EV management approach, like any program \ntracking tool, is to proactively identify program issues before they escalate into \nsigni fi cant problems. \n\n The inherent delay in monthly data reporting (usually the lag between a compa-\nny\u2019s monthly  fi nancial closing date, the time to perform data and variance analysis, \nand the actual EV report creation\u2014on the order of 15\u201320 days after monthly close) \ncan make this challenging, and a good Program Manager and Engineering Team\u2019s \ninstincts are a more timely guide. \n\n Ideally, the monthly EV data will simply con fi rm what the management team \nalready knows about their risk areas, and provide a mechanism for applying program \ndollars (usually in the form of management reserve) to the problem\u2014if dollars are \nneeded to solve it. \n\n Although an EVMS system reports data in terms of dollars, and the ratios calculated \nfrom the dollar values of work, remember that solving program issues does not always \ninvolve applying money. Management response may take the form of personnel actions \n(adding, deleting, or changing the roles of staff), reprioritizing work, creating a tiger \nteam to address the issue (which can be very effective, particularly if you include the \ncustomer on that team) or a myriad of other potential management actions. \n\n A key to success here is keeping your customer informed when you have a chal-\nlenge. It can be tempting to stay silent on such issues, but it is almost always prefer-\nable to proactively keep your customer informed\u2014indicating your understanding of \nthe issue and laying out a plan to address the problem. \n\n  Customer con fi dence is bolstered not so much by perfect execution, but by the idea \nthat your management team can capably handle the program challenges that inevita-\nbly arise .  \n\n      Program Schedule Development \n\n As previously discussed, a mid-sized program schedule should be developed utilizing \nthe established WBS structure and adding information on durations, resources, and \ntask interdependencies. \n\n Developing and managing a complex program schedule may often require a \ntrained scheduler who collects and integrates schedule input from the management \nand engineering teams\u2014but ultimately the Program Manager is responsible for \nreviewing and executing the program schedule. \n\n Overall durations of mid-sized programs (from contract start to launch) may range \nfrom a minimum of about 2 years (in the case of little or no new technology develop-\nment) to 5 years or more depending on a variety of factors, not the least of which is \nfunding stability. Durations of less than 2 years are possible if long-lead items\u2014\nwhich can sometimes take 18 months or more to deliver\u2014are ordered ahead of con-\ntract start or immediately upon signing. \n\n The spacecraft contractor often winds up maintaining the mission-level master schedule, \nincluding payload inputs, launch vehicle and mission operations preparation milestones, \n\n\n\n322\n\n2 \u2013 4 4 \u2013 6 4 \u2013 8 2 \u2013 4 2 \u2013 8 1 \u2013 2 ~ 18 \u2013 16\n\nTypical schedules for mid-sized programs range from two to four years from contract start to launch (assuming a single satellite).\n\nThough tempting to rush SRR,\nextra time spent solidifying\nrequirements in this phase\nreduces future schedule risk.\n\nMany long-lead items may need\nto be ordered prior to CDR to meet\nschedule; focus on analyses that\nverify componenet selection.\n\nPayload integration\nis simplified by early\nverification of interfaces\nusing simulators.\n\nContract\nStart\n\nSRR PDR CDR PSR Launch Complete\nOn-Orbit\nCheckout\n\nStart Bus\nIntegration\n\nStart PL\nIntegration\n\nSystem Test\n\n24 \u2013 48 months\n\nM\no\n\nn\nth\n\ns \nfr\n\no\nm\n\np\nri\n\no\nr \n\nm\nile\n\nst\no\n\nn\ne\n\n  Figure 9.22.

Anticipating this probability, and budgeting for the time \nnecessary to keep that schedule updated, is important even in the proposal phase. \n\n A logical, complete, and well-maintained master schedule will accurately identify \nboth the primary and secondary critical paths, and enable management visibility and \nfocus on the key tasks, resources, and interdependencies that support it. \n\n Figure  9.22  presents an example of a \u201ctypical\u201d mid-sized program schedule \nincluding ranges between major milestones\u2014again dependent on speci fi c program \nrequirements and risks.  \n\n      The Space Program Organization \n\n Structuring a space program organization can be complicated by a variety of factors, \nincluding the number of stakeholders involved, their contractual relationships (or lack \nthereof), and the degree of new technology development required for a given mission. \n\n If a mission is primarily a rebuild or slight modi fi cation of a previous mission with \na single prime contractor providing a complete space vehicle and launch, the program \norganization may be quite simple, with a classic hierarchical structure of prime (with \nseveral subcontractors) reporting to customer. \n\n However, if signi fi cant, higher risk development of certain elements is necessary, \nand if there are many diverse providers and stakeholders, the program organization \nmust enable appropriate participation and access for all the stakeholders\u2014as well as \nvery clear lines of responsibility and authority (Figure  9.23 ). \n\n A mid-sized program team, particularly one with a US Government customer, is \ntypically organized into Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) or Integrated Product \nDevelopment Teams (IPDTs). \n\n The US DOD\u2019s Integrated Product and Process Development (IPPD) Handbook \nissued by the Of fi ce of the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology) \n(  https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=106001    ) most succinctly de fi nes \nthis process and organizational approach as follows:\n\n  A management technique that simultaneously integrates all essential acquisition activities through \nthe use of multidisciplinary teams to optimize the design, manufacturing and supportability \nprocesses.

An IPT-based organization.       \n\nExamples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\nproduction, including  fi eld support. One of the key IPPD tenets is multidisciplinary teamwork \nthrough Integrated Product Teams (IPTs).   \n\n An IPT is essentially a team of people\u2014often from more than one organization\u2014who \nare responsible for successfully delivering a major part of a program\u2014like the spacecraft \nbus, the experiment(s) or payload(s), launch vehicle, and mission operations function. \n\n It provides a mechanism for many different organizations\u2014including organizations \nthat are often used by customers to oversee contractor activity\u2014to participate in the \ndevelopment of a particular item. It is not, however, a design-by-committee exercise. \n\n The organization chartered with the  fi nal product delivery has ultimate authority, \nwithin customer and contractual constraints. An IPT usually has a single lead indi-\nvidual, from the organization that is under contract for that deliverable, who orga-\nnizes the team, runs regular meetings, tracks action items, and interfaces with \nprogram management to provide status. \n\n A Program Management IPT\u2014which may or may not include a mission system \nengineering (SE) element (resulting in a combined PM/SE IPT)\u2014is usually com-\nprised of the customer Program Manager (PM) and the prime contractor\u2019s Program \nManager staff, and may include other members who provide management support \nfunctions. \n\n The Program Manager IPT oversees the other IPTs and typically controls the over-\nall program risk management process. \n\n Smooth functioning of the program management team demands competent execu-\ntion of all three primary management functions:\n\n   Program Management Executive (retains responsibility and authority for success-\u2022 \nful program execution; serves as primary customer interface)  \n  Engineering Lead (may also be called Chief Engineer or Chief System Engineer; \u2022 \nresponsible for leading the totality of technical activities including design, analy-\nses, assembly, integration and test, and on-orbit checkout)  \n\n \n\n\n\n324 Space Program Management\n\n  Business Support (an umbrella term for Contracts, Program Control, \u2022 \nProcurement, etc.)    \n\n Underperformance in any one of these areas will vastly affect overall program \nexecution, so it is critical to staff these key positions with experienced personnel with \ndemonstrated capabilities. \n\n It can be tempting to use more junior staff in key positions to reduce cost; while \nthis approach can work with highly motivated, well-mentored individuals, it can \nsometimes back fi re with schedule delays (and increased costs) created by technical \nmistakes and work that must be redone, as well as eroding customer con fi dence. \n\n Please note that the previous comment applies only to key, senior positions on the \nprogram. In general, it is highly desirable to have a diverse mix of seniority\u2014from \njunior engineers to highly experienced principals with many programs to their \ncredit\u2014contributing to a program\u2019s execution. Ideally, the more experienced staff \nprovides tasking, mentoring, support, and oversight to the more junior individuals, \nwho actually perform signi fi cant portions of engineering analyses and development, \nmay author much of the technical documentation, and perhaps most importantly, \nbring fresh perspective and current tools to the work. \n\n Judicious management of this skill mix may result in lower program costs (by \nutilizing cheaper resources for many tasks), while still ensuring the quality of the \nwork\u2014and accomplishing the parallel goal of transferring knowledge to the next \ngeneration of space engineers. \n\n The small, self-contained structure and operation of each IPT may allow it to be \nmanaged with the star structure discussed in the microsatellite management section, \nwhere the IPT lead maintains proactive communication with all the IPT participants. \n\n The IPT lead usually determines the communication paradigms\u2014frequency of \nmeetings, etc., which may vary depending on the phase of the program. \n\n For example, the Mission Operations or Ground System IPT may meet less fre-\nquently during the very early phases of a program, but may meet more frequently as \nlaunch and operations preparations accelerate. IPTs may also be combined at some \npoint\u2014the Bus and Payload IPTs may combine into the \u201cI&T\u201d IPT after the payload \nis delivered and integrated with the bus. \n\n The internal structure of the Bus IPT bears further discussion, as the size of that \nteam alone may drive a more traditional hierarchy. In this author\u2019s experience, a mid-\nsized program has a core engineering team of 15\u201325 individuals, supplemented by \nadditional specialists at various phases of the program. \n\n Production and I&T staff are typically added at the post-CDR point to perform \ndetailed planning and execution of the subsequent phases, swelling the bus team to \n40 or more as the design team  fi nalizes design documents and analyses, overlapping \nwith the subsequent phases. \n\n In this case, the program Chief Engineer leads the system engineering team, with \nthe various subsystem leads (Power, Attitude Control, Command and Data Handling, \nStructure/Mechanical, Software, etc.) reporting to the Chief Engineer. \n\n Depending on the degree of in-house development (versus procurement) of a \ngiven subsystem, that subsystem team may number one to  fi ve or more individuals. \n\n Program support functions like Program Control (cost and schedule tracking), \nContracts, Subcontracts, and Purchasing/Procurement are often assigned as an indi-\nrect report to the Program Manager from a matrix structure within the company. \n\n\n\n325\n\n  Figure 9.24.     The TSX-5 medium-sized spacecraft. (Photo courtesy from Orbital Science \nCorporation).       \n\nExamples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n The Mission Assurance or Quality function also almost always maintains a sepa-\nrate reporting chain outside the program to executive levels, to ensure that function\u2019s \nunbiased oversight without being unduly in fl uenced or overruled by a program\u2019s cost \nor schedule pressures (elevating any areas of contention to higher levels). \n\n A top-level IPT structure is equally effective for commercial programs though \nmay be somewhat less formal. \n\n The ongoing second-generation Orbcomm (OG2) spacecraft program, with prime \ncontractor Sierra Nevada Corporation, is utilizing such a structure at this writing, with \nIPTs designated for bus, payload, and launch (this topic is discussed in more detail in \nthe section on multiple satellite programs). \n\n Although launch for the  fi rst 18 OG2 spacecraft is being provided by SpaceX \nunder direct contract to Orbcomm, the LV IPT within the spacecraft organizational \nstructure ensures there is a single clear interface to the LV contractor, and that various \nspacecraft technical leads (structure, thermal, software, etc.) can be called by the IPT \nlead to support LV interface issues as required. \n\n It is important to note that the bus/payload IPTs\u2014sometimes as a combined \nentity\u2014continue through the entire mission life cycle including support for on-orbit \noperations. \n\n To the degree that the technical leads can be kept available (though obviously no \nlonger assigned full-time to the program) for purposes of periodic telemetry evalua-\ntion, and on-call on-orbit anomaly resolution support, such continuity greatly \nenhances the probability of long-term mission success.  \n\n      Tri-Service eXperiments-5 (TSX-5) Mission Case Study \n\n The Tri-Service Experiments-5 mission (TSX-5), developed for the DoD\u2019s STP in the \nlate 1990s and launched in June 2000, provides a good example of this kind of pro-\ngram organization (Figure  9.24 ). \n\n \n\n\n\n326 Space Program Management\n\n TSX-5  fl ew two major experiments\u2014the Space Test Research Vehicle-2 (STRV-2), \na Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) sponsored experiment that itself \nwas comprised of seven sub-experiments, including one provided by the UK\u2014and \nthe Compact Environmental Anomaly Sensor Experiment (CEASE), provided by the \nUS Air Force Phillips Laboratory. \n\n Orbital Sciences Corp (Orbital) was the prime contractor responsible for the bus, \npayload integration, and in this case the launch vehicle, a Pegasus XL rocket. \nParticipants included all the various experiment provider organizations including JPL \n(the lead for STRV-2), engineering support contractors including the Aerospace \nCorporation, and the mission operations organization (Space and Missile Systems \nCenters Detachment 12). A more complete discussion of this mission can be found at \n  www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2001/04.html    . \n\n In the case of TSX-5, the IPT structure helped resolve a variety of technical chal-\nlenges during development and I&T\u2014particularly solar array deployment, several \nthermal issues, a ground system data incompatibility problem, and a timing anomaly \nthat was identi fi ed late at the launch site\u2014by allowing all stakeholder organizations \nto rapidly communicate and analyze the problems, options, and subsequent resolution \nplans including retest at multiple levels. \n\n This communication could be performed most ef fi ciently and effectively using the \nIPT approach, especially during the time-critical I&T and pre-launch phases where \ntimely decision-making was imperative.  \n\n      Mission Budgets and Examples \n\n Budgets for mid-sized space missions vary as widely as their mission requirements \nand are driven by a variety of factors including:\n\n    \u2022 Technical requirements for both bus and payload \u2014for example, a precision point-\ning bus like the Joint MilliArcsecond Path fi nder Survey (JMAPS) may require \nhigher precision attitude control components than is typical, plus signi fi cant per-\nformance modeling and software development\u2014driving costs up. Alternatively, a \ncommunication mission like the Orbcomm second-generation (OG2) with rela-\ntively relaxed pointing requirements, and where the payload also serves as the \nTT&C capability, may allow a much cheaper bus solution.  \n   \u2022 Degree of technical development necessary to achieve mission requirements, also \nknown as Technology Readiness Level (TRL) maturation.  Reuse of existing \ndesigns in proven con fi gurations helps keep costs down. Development of any \nkind\u2014whether hardware or software\u2014adds cost. It is worth negotiating hard in \nthe early design phases to minimize development and maximize the use of previ-\nously proven designs\u2014unless the whole purpose of the mission is to demonstrate \nnew technologies. In that case, risk factors must be mutually agreed upon between \ncustomer and contractor, and applied to those higher risk areas in the form of \nbudget and schedule margin.  \n   \u2022 Number of units procured, at the component, subsystem, or system level \u2014any \nquantity greater than one introduces the opportunity to reduce cost on  N  + 1 units, \nassuming all nonrecurring effort has been accomplished on the  fi rst unit. Even \nmore cost savings can be achieved if multiple units are ordered concurrently, \nrather than sequentially.  \n\nhttp://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2001/04.html\n\n\n327Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n   \u2022 Launch approach \u2014launching as a primary payload on any given launcher is \nalmost always more expensive than launching as a secondary, but mission require-\nments for orbit parameters, launch schedule, and other factors may not allow a \nchoice in the matter.  \n   \u2022 Contract type \u2014rule of thumb is that a  fi xed-price contract, where the contractor \ntakes the  fi nancial risk of growth, is more expensive at the proposal phase than a \ncost-plus type contract for the same scope\u2014because the contractor must build in \nsuf fi cient cost margins to cover their risk if costs are not guaranteed to be reim-\nbursed. Fixed-price contracts are normally applied where development risk is lim-\nited or at least largely quanti fi able. Cost-plus type contracts acknowledge the \ncustomer\u2019s acceptance of cost growth risk\u2014though there may often be provisions \nwhere that risk is shared with the contractor via award fee criteria that penalizes \ngrowth, or other incentive fee provisions. Both types of contracts are used in mid-\nsized missions depending on the nature of the program. Most missions whose pri-\nmary purpose is technology demonstration are cost-plus- fi xed fee (CPFF) or some \nform of cost-plus-incentive or\u2014award fee (CPIF or CPAF), given that their pri-\nmary mission is to incorporate new technologies that are inherently risky. Most \nSTP missions and the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) TacSat series are \ngood examples. The exception may be the case where a \u201cstandard bus\u201d approach is \nused\u2014enabling the same design to be utilized for multiple missions and payloads \nwith only minor (if any) technical changes. Commercial missions, particularly \nmultisatellite constellations, very often utilize  fi rm  fi xed price (FFP) contracts, \nunder the premise that any initial development risk is offset by the low recurring \ncost of the production phase, supporting reasonable pro fi t expectations on the entire \nprogram. OG2 is again a prime example of a commercial program that utilizes a \nFFP contract despite development of new designs for both bus and payload.    \n\n The following examples show the wide range of mid-sized mission costs and their \ndistribution\u2014with total spacecraft costs ranging from less than $5 M in quantity \n(OG2 for 18 spacecraft) versus bus-only costs nearing $40 M for precision-pointers \nwith highly mission-speci fi c requirements like JMAPS. \n\n Note that all  fi gures were obtained from open sources, published articles, and press \nreleases.\n\n   TSX-5 total mission cost at $85 M (contracted in 1996, launched in 2000, operated \u2022 \nfor 2 + years). Of that total, bus + LV contract was $25 M to Orbital on a  fi xed price \nbasis (as TSX-5 was actually the  fi fth in a series that included the STEP 1\u20134 mis-\nsions), roughly 50/50 cost split between spacecraft and launch vehicle. Remainder \nof budget was two payloads plus mission operations.  \n  Orbcomm Gen-2\u201318 SC + payload + dispensers for three launches at total of \u2022 \n$117 M (awarded 2008).

A web-based or other hosted server that contains \nall necessary program documentation, and is accessible to all the participating orga-\nnizations (with access restricted to need-to-know areas), is typical in many current \nprograms, although this is made more challenging by the frequency and sophistica-\ntion of cyber attacks, making some companies leery to host them. Regular meetings \nare also useful so long as that approach does not venture into overkill. \n\n Most effective is proactive, informal, and honest communication between the vari-\nous management teams\u2014either by frequent phone and e-mail contact, or face-to-face \nas often as practical. \n\n As in any relationship, it is essential to build trust early in a program, particularly \nbetween customer and contractor, and communication of both good and bad news \n(along with a plan to address the bad news) is critical. \n\n The information that is conveyed in more formal monthly or quarterly manage-\nment reviews should contain no surprises, particularly to the customer, and should be \nmerely a synopsis of what they already know. \n\n Formal program reviews (i.e., SRR, PDR, CDR, etc.) are also an important com-\nmunication tool, as they often attract reviewers who are not involved in the program\u2019s \nday-to-day activities\u2014but again, should generally be presentations of information \nthat is already well known, not a venue for bringing up controversial nonconfor-\nmances or design options. \n\n \n\n\n\n329Examples of Management Applied to Different Space Programs \n\n Formal reviews should be proceeded by more informal, working technical sessions \nbetween contractor, customer, and any other reviewing organizations\u2014to present the \ndesign or test results and address any major comments\u2014with the goal of signi fi cant \nreduction in the number of  fi ndings and/or action items out of the formal review. \n\n Larger and thus more visible programs are somewhat dependent on these formal \nreviews, as they demonstrate achievement of well-de fi ned milestones and act as gates \nfor entering subsequent program phases (i.e., starting integration and test, or shipping \n fl ight hardware for the next integration phase). \n\n Successfully passing them\u2014on the  fi rst try, without the need for \u201cdelta\u201d or fol-\nlow-up reviews\u2014again serves to increase customer con fi dence and the likelihood of \ncontinued high-level support (including funding). \n\n Contract changes, while not inevitable, happen so frequently in space programs \nthat they may seem so. \n\n Requirements changes, launch date movement, funding constraints, and other \n factors over the multiyear duration of most programs typically result in one or more \ncontractual actions. \n\n Change of any kind will almost certainly impact cost and/or schedule, often both, \nand so for small-to-mid-sized programs there is frequently a concerted effort to \n minimize changes. \n\n The primary situation to avoid is where there is disagreement between customer \nand contractor over whether a particular item actually constitutes a contractual \nchange. Requirements \u201cclari fi cations,\u201d different interpretations of SOW, technical \nspeci fi cations, or other contractual documents, delays in CFE\u2019s or other outside deliv-\nerables, ambiguous requirements for \u201ctechnical interchange support\u201d where such \nsupport is unquanti fi ed, may all be sources of cost growth to a program\u2014and also a \nsource of debate whether they constitute actual changes in scope. \n\n Thus, it is really critical to establish the program cost, schedule, and performance \nbaseline\u2014including speci fi c lists of assumptions if any were made during the pro-\nposal period and making them part of the contract\u2014such that changes to that baseline \nare easily quanti fi ed. \n\n This short-circuits lengthy justi fi cations and potentially painful negotiations, all of \nwhich can erode trust and damage working relationships if taken to an extreme. \n\n As most of us in this industry are painfully aware, the US Government, like other \ngovernment customer organizations worldwide, is often faced with funding continu-\nity challenges, particularly for the DOD and NASA\u2014key customers for this class of \nspace mission. Operating under \u201cContinuing Resolution\u201d scenarios without an \napproved  fi scal year budget and thus with the possibility of program restructuring \nonce a  fi nal government budget is agreed, is a fact of life for many programs. \n\n Delays in receiving contracted funding increments in a timely manner even under \napproved budgets is also a management issue faced in many if not most government \nprograms. \n\n These scenarios present many challenges to the program\u2019s management\u2014how to \ncontinue program progress while minimizing schedule impacts, particularly if funds are \nnot available to put key subcontractors under contract, and to maintain team continuity. \n\n In times of limited funding, top priority should be given to maintaining the core \nprogram team and make incremental forward progress on key schedule milestones. \n\n\n\n330 Space Program Management\n\n Options may include modifying the entry criteria for those milestones, particularly \ndesign reviews, to enable at least partial completion (recognizing that delta-reviews \nmay be necessary). \n\n The other challenge is keeping track of schedule impacts that result from those \nfunding delays (and associated cost growth) such that change proposals or other equi-\ntable adjustments can be made to the contract. Rules of thumb here are  fi rst, make \nsure the current contract baseline is very clear\u2014such that changes to it can be easily \nidenti fi ed\u2014and second, to obtain written contractual direction from the customer \nidentifying the schedule and funding assumptions against which any change proposal \nshould be developed. \n\n Try to avoid multiple \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios if possible, as repeated replanning activi-\nties are a major resource and time drain. \n\n A  fi nal word on the importance of good \u201cpeople management\u201d over the course of a \nsuccessful program. Many books are written, classes taught, and team-building exer-\ncises undertaken to try to achieve a highly effective and successful team dynamic. \n\n Achieving this goal in a space program can be challenging with a crew composed \nof sometimes-introverted engineers who would just as soon drive a computer and \nchurn out analyses as go to time-consuming meetings with real humans\u2014and where \nthe Program Managers are often engineers themselves and not necessarily trained or \nskilled in all aspects of people management. Program management is sometimes \nviewed as a necessary evil rather than the skilled profession it really is. \n\n A successful Program Manager\u2019s primary goals should be to recruit and assemble \nthe right staff in key positions, and then create an environment where they can suc-\nceed\u2014in the form of tools, facilities, training, establishment of clear roles and authority, \nand perhaps most importantly, protection from unnecessary distractions and elimina-\ntion of nonvalue-added processes. \n\n Emphasis too should be placed on meeting employee\u2019s individual goals\u2014for pro-\nmotion, learning, adding new experiences, etc.\u2014and aligning those individual goals \nwith program goals to the greatest degree possible. \n\n Watching a great team perform well is one of the most satisfying aspects of being \na Program Manager.                                 \n\n\n\n331M.

\nsince mid-1980s. After working for many years in major space programs  fi rst at the \nEuropean Space Agency ESA ESTEC establishment in Noordwijk, and then at the \nArianespace French consortium in Evry and in French Guyana, he joined Alenia Space \nItalia (now Thales Alenia Space) and Finmeccanica SpA in Rome covering various \nmanagement roles. He now works at the Italian Space Agency as Staff of the President. \nHe has written over 50 scienti fi c papers and publications, two books on space explora-\ntion history and astronomy, and a professional book on space programs management. \nHe teaches space systems engineering, at the Universities \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d and \u201cTor \nVergata\u201d in Rome, and he also teaches professional courses on space systems at the \nMasters in Space Policy SIOI of the Italian Foreign Affairs Minister. \n\n  Rick Fleeter , graduated in Aerospace Propulsion Engineering, is a space profes-\nsional since early 1980s. He founded and was the CEO of the USA\u2019s  fi rst company \ndedicated to small, low cost space, AeroAstro, from 1988 to 2008. He has written the \nonly two books on microspace, Micro Space Craft and The Logic of Microspace. \nAfter many years working in major space programs, having developed 24 small \nspacecraft (which are still nowadays orbiting our Earth or travelling in the Solar \nSystem), he escaped to the small satellite environment. He now teaches space systems \nengineering, design, and technology transfer at Brown University in Providence, \nRhode Island and at \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d University in Rome. He also works at the Italian \nSpace Agency as consultant. He teaches professional courses worldwide on small \nspace and space program management, and he continues to behave as if small space-\ncraft can and should take over the world. \n\n  Mauro Balduccini , graduated in Nuclear Engineering at the Rome University \u201cLa \nSapienza,\u201d started his professional activity at the end of the 1970s, in the Stress \nAnalysis department of the former Breda Termomeccanica (now Ansaldo), then he \nmoved to the former BPD SpA (now Avio SpaA) as design responsible for space \npropulsion systems, and then as Program Manager for propulsion and control \nstages. Later working at the former Alenia Spazio (now Thales Alenia Space), he \nwas platform responsible for the SICRAL1 military Satellite and System manager \nof ITALSAT2 communication satellite. Back in Avio in the 1990s, he held the \nresponsibility of the Cyclone4 Launcher modernization program, and then he was \nthe  fi rst General Manager of the ELV company (Avio 70%, ASI 30%) for the \nESAVega Launcher Development Program. He is now at Avio Space Division. \n\n\n\n338 Authors\u2019 Short Biographies\n\nHe participated in several speci fi c international technical teams (Ariane 501 failure \ninvestigation tech support team) and he holds seminars and courses at the University \n\u201cLa Spaienza\u201d in Rome. \n\n  Federico Nasini  is in charge of the Finance and Insurance Department at Thales \nAlenia Space Italia Sp.A., where he has worked since 1998, holding several posi-\ntions at the  fi nancial department. Prior to joining Thales Alenia Space, he worked \nas a export and project  fi nance manager at Finmeccanica S.p.A., the main Italian \nindustrial group operating globally in the aerospace, defense, and security domain. \nAfter graduating in Political Science at La Sapienza University of Rome, he \nearned a degree in Corporate Finance at the London School of Economics and \nattended the Credit Risk Evaluation School at I.R.I Management school. He has \nexperience in trade, export, and project  fi nance techniques both in the domestic \nand international domain. He holds seminars at the Unversity of Cheti-Pescara, \nG. D\u2019Annunzio and SIOI\u2014Societa Italiana per l\u2019Organizzazione Internazionale, \nand he is the author of several papers focusing on project  fi nancing techniques \napplied at the Space business.    \n\n\n\n339\n\n    1.   @RISK, commercial Software documentation, Palisade EMEA&India, \n31TheGreen, West DraytonMiddlesexUB77PN(UK)  \n\n    2.
