This is also vitally\n\nimportant in preserving the long-term security of life as we know it against a natural or\n\nman-made extinction event. These reasons are why I created SpaceX and why I believe\n\nthe space industry is so important.\n\nIn 2010, SpaceX became the first private company to bring a spacecraft back from\n\norbit when our Dragon vehicle completed two revolutions of the Earth before returning\n\nsafely with a splashdown approximately 800 km west of California. I am pleased to say\n\nthat Dragon was in such good shape that it could be flown again just by repacking the\n\nparachutes.\n\nThat was the first of many steps toward what I believe to be the utterly critical goal of\n\norbital space flight: complete and rapid reusability. This is the fundamental break-\n\nthrough in space flight that must be achieved, whether by SpaceX or another company.\n\nOur Falcon 9 launch vehicle, for example, costs over $50M to build, but the propellant\n\n(liquid oxygen and kerosene) cost is only $0.2M, implying that more than a 100-fold\n\nimprovement in the cost of space flight is achievable. This ratio is comparable to that of\n\naircraft, which are, of course, highly reusable. The quest for this breakthrough is what\n\nmakes this handbook on space technology so valuable at this time, contributing, as it\n\nwill, to the proliferation and exploitation of space technology to enable the conscious-\n\nness of humanity to move beyond our cradle and to explore beyond this Earth.\n\nThe initiative taken by Springer Praxis to initiate this handbook is warmly welcomed,\n\nwhile the efforts of the editorial team of Malcolm Macdonald and Viorel Badescu in\n\nrealizing their vision over 25 chapters, written by experts from all around the world, are\n\ncommended.\n\nWherever in the world they may find themselves, I hope the readers of this handbook\n\nwill use the knowledge contained within to devote their energy toward achieving great\n\nbreakthroughs.\n\nElon Musk\n\nvii\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nA critical part of writing any book is the review process, and the authors and editors are\n\nvery much obliged to the following researchers who patiently helped them read-through\n\nthe subsequent chapters and who made valuable suggestions:\n\nErik Andrews Back Nine Engineering, Laurel, Maryland, USA\nViorel Badescu Polytechnic University of Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania\nTim Barfoot University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada\nMax Calabro The Inner Arch, Villennes, France\nDaniel Choukroun Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands\nAlan P.

Spencer\n\nIf I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said\nfaster horses.\n\n\u2014Henry Ford (1863\u20131947).\n\nAs the births of living creatures at first are ill-shapen, so are all\ninnovations, which are the births of time.\n\n\u2014Sir Francis Bacon (1561\u20131626).\n\nHumanity has dreamt of traveling beyond our cradle and\ninto space since, at least, the time of the Roman conquest of\nGreece, after the Battle of Corinth in 146 BC. In what is\nconsidered the earliest known fiction about travel to outer\nspace, alien life-forms and interplanetary warfare, Lucian of\nSamosata wrote a satirical piece in 150 AD called True\nHistory. In part of this story a company of adventuring\nheroes are swept upwards in a giant waterspout shortly after\nsailing westward through the Pillars of Hercules (today\nknown as the Strait of Gibraltar). After seven days and seven\nnights, they arrive on the Moon to find themselves embroiled\nin a war between the King of the Moon and the King of the\nSun over the Morning Star (Venus). The Sun wins.\n\nFrom then until Jules Verne\u2019s novel From Earth to the\nMoon (French: De la Terre \u00e0 la Lune, 1865; published 1867\nin English) many fanciful tales were told of humanity\u2019s\ntravels beyond Earth. Perhaps one of the more curious of\nthese tales was given by Cyrano de Bergerac, in 1657, in\nwhich he reasoned that the dew on morning grass\n\ndisappearing in daytime meant that the Sun must \u2018suck\u2019 up\nthe dew. Hence, should enough dew be collected and stored\nin bottles attached to the traveler he need only stand on his\nlawn in a fine morning and the Sun will \u2018suck\u2019 him up along\nwith the morning dew.\n\nTo this day space technology maintains a mystique that\nmost other forms of engineering struggle to emulate, and that\nnone have managed to maintain quite so well. But do not be\nblinded by the glamor, this is no witchcraft; space technology\noffers unique opportunities in science, technology and\ncommerce.\n\n1.1 Historical Perspective\n\nOn October 4, 1957 the Space Age began with the launch of\nSputnik-1 (Russian: PS-1, C?y????-1, or Elementary Satel-\nlite-1) into an elliptical, low-Earth orbit by the Union of Soviet\nSocialist Republics (CCCP or USSR), and simultaneously a\nColdWar crisis was initiated within America and her allies. To\nillustrate the impact of Sputnik-1 in modern terms, the\nAmerican labor union leader Walter Reuther decried it as a\n\u201cbloodless Pearl Harbor\u201d, invoking the same imagery as used\nin the aftermath of major modern-day events such as the series\nof coordinated suicide attacks within the United States of\nAmerica (US) on September 11, 2001. The Sputnik Crisis\nwithin the US heralded the political imperative that space\ntechnological superiority would hold, and which would\nmaterially drive the development of the technology for both\ngood and bad, especially with regard to human space flight.\n\nThe emergence, evolution and development of space\ntechnology, like most technologies, can be described by\nborrowing from Diffusion of Innovations theory and using a\nlogistics function, seen in Fig. 1.1. Starting with the early\npioneers, progressing through to the launch of Sputnik-1,\nand beyond, this section will provide a historical perspective\nfor the later technology chapters of the handbook. However,\ndue to the above-noted political imperative that has been,\n\nM.

Indeed, it is\nremarkable to note that Tsiolkovsky credited Verne\u2019s novel\nwith planting the \u201cseeds of curiosity\u201d which led to his calcu-\nlations of the motion of a rocket. Tsiolkovsky documented\nmany vital features of space travel, detailing these for the first\ntime, and laying the foundations to inspire generations of\nengineers that followed him. Amongst his work, Tsiolkovsky\nderived the modern form of the \u2018Ideal Rocket Equation\u2019, see\nChap. 4, in 1903 [1], prior to the first flight of the Wright\nbrothers, and determined for the first time the velocity\nrequired to reach Earth orbit. It should be noted however that\nrocketry research within western Europe was by this time well\nestablished, having been induced by, amongst others, the\n1810 Academy of Copenhagen\u2019s prize question to calculate\nthe curve described by a rocket when projected in any oblique\ndirection in vacuo. Induced by this 1810 prize, mathemati-\ncians such as William Moore (fl. c. 1806\u20131823), the sixth\nmathematical master at the Royal Military Academy, Wool-\nwich, England considered the motion of rockets in media\nother than air. The justification of this early rocketry research\nwas principally to advance theories in Navel Gunnery.\nHowever, a form of Tsiolkovsky\u2019s rocket equation can be\nfound in Moore\u2019s 1813 treatise when considering the \u201cmotion\n\nof rockets in a non-resisting medium\u201d [2], perhaps repre-\nsenting the earliest example of this kind of equation. It is also\nof note that the Belgian artillery Major-General Casimir Er-\nasme Coquilhat (1811\u20131890) published an article in 1873\ntitled Trajectoires des fus\u00e9es volantes dans le vide (Trajectory\nof flying rockets in vacuum) in the M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9\nRoyale des Sciences de Li\u00e8ge [3]. Coquilhat\u2019s work, like\nMoore\u2019s before, was focused on the use of rockets in war, but,\nlike Moore, he presents the rocket equation before Tsiolkov-\nsky\u2019s 1903 publication.\n\nTsiolkovsky also recognized that multi-stage rockets,\nwhen fueled by something akin to liquid oxygen, would be\nbest to achieve this required velocity change to reach Earth\norbit. This seminal work was published in 1903 in the\nRussian journal Hay??oe o?o?pe??e, or Scientific Review,\nin an article titled Investigation of outer space rocket\nappliances [1]. However, rather unfortunately the journal\nedition also contained a politically revolutionary article that\nled to the journal\u2019s confiscation by the Tsarist authorities,\nmeaning that Tsiolkovsky\u2019s work went virtually unnoticed\nuntil after the Bolshevik Revolution; his support of which it\ncan be surmised was not harmed by this earlier incident.\nAmongst Tsiolkovsky\u2019s other work, he designed rockets\nwith steering thrusters, space stations, airlocks for exiting a\nspaceship into the vacuum of space, and closed-cycle bio-\nlogical systems to provide food and oxygen for space col-\nonies. After the October Revolution of 1917, and the\ncreation of the USSR, Tsiolkovsky\u2019s accomplishments were\nformally recognized and in 1921 he received a lifetime\npension from the state that allowed him to retire from\nteaching and devote himself to his studies. It was sometime\nafter this that his work became more widely known in the\nWest, by which time engineers such as Hermann Oberth\n(1894\u20131989), in Germany, and Robert Goddard (1882\u2013\n1945), in the United States (US), had independently derived\nmany of his key contributions. However, within the Soviet\nUnion Tsiolkovsky was a powerful influence on, amongst\nothers, the luminary engineers Sergei Korolev, also trans-\nliterated as Sergey Korolyov (1907\u20131966) and Valentin\nGlushko (1908\u20131989).\n\nThe emergence, evolution and development of space\ntechnology through the pioneering engineering phase of\nFig. 1.1, which commenced with the works of Tsiolkovsky,\nwas continued by Robert Goddard, who is credited with\ndesigning and building the world\u2019s first liquid-fueled rocket,\nwhich he successfully launched on March 16, 1926. As early\nas 1920 Goddard had proposed the concept of sending a\nsmall rocket to the Moon; however this concept was widely\nridiculed in the mainstream American press. The New York\nTimes wrongly stated in an editorial that Goddard\u2019s under-\nstanding of Newton\u2019s laws of motion was fundamentally\nflawed due to \u201cthe need to have something better than a\nvacuum against which to react\u201d. It took the New York Times\n\nFig. 1.1 The logistic function, taken from diffusion of innovations\ntheory and used to describe a generic technology development\n\n2 M. Macdonald et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nforty-nine years to issue a correction to this statement and an\napology; published the day after the Apollo-11 launch. And\nof Goddard\u2019s first liquid-fueled rocket flight? It traveled\n56 m in 2.5 s, reaching a maximum height of just over 12 m.\n\nIn parallel to Goddard\u2019s efforts, Hermann Oberth, again\ninspired by the writings of Jules Verne, was investigating\nrocketry and space technology. Oberth discussed almost\nevery phase of rocket travel, including the abnormal effects of\npressure on the human body and published many popular\nbooks which were important not only for the new ideas\nwithin them, but for the inspiration they gave. Indeed Oberth\nalso worked as a technical consultant on the first, so-called,\nhard science fiction film to have scenes set in outer space,\nFrau im Mond, released in 1929, directed and produced by\nthe film pioneer Friedrich Christian Anton \u2018Fritz\u2019 Lang\n(1890\u20131976) and based on the novel Die Frau im Mond\nwritten in 1928 by Thea Gabriele von Harbou (1888\u20131954)\n(Fig. 1.2). This film was key to popularizing the ideas of\nrocketry and space exploration. However, it should be noted\nthat the first ever science fiction film, Le Voyage dans la lune,\ndirected and produced by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s (1861\u20131938, full\nname Marie-Georges-Jean M\u00e9li\u00e8s), a 1902 French black-and-\nwhite 14 min (projected at the then standard 16 frames per\nsecond) silent movie, also featured lunar exploration. Le\nVoyage dans la lune was loosely based on two popular novels\nof its time, From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne and\nThe First Men in the Moon by H. G. Wells.\n\nHowever, the emerging popular culture interest in rocketry\nand space travel, along with a small pioneering group of\nengineers, was not yet reflected within the establishment. This\nbegan to change in the early 1930s within Germany. As with\nso many technical innovations, and as an unforeseen conse-\nquence of previous attempts to avoid future wars in Europe, it\nwas the military who would drive the technology forward.\nUnder the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the Weimar\nRepublic, officially the Deutsches Reich, colloquially known\n\nsimply as Germany in the English speaking World, was\nforbidden from having an air force or advanced artillery. As a\nresult, the German military began to search for new weapons\nthat would not violate the terms of this treaty. In August 1932,\napproximately six months prior to the foundation of the Third\nReich, Wernher von Braun (1912\u20131977) was recruited by the\nGerman Army to aid in developing liquid-fueled rockets,\nessentially as a form of long-range artillery. It is of note that\nwhile von Braun made the decision to accept a research grant\nfrom the German military, and hence to be associated with the\nNational Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP, or Nazi\nparty), other leading compatriots within the German amateur\nrocketry society, the Verein f\u00fcr Raumschiffahrt (VfR), such as\nWalter Hohmann (1880\u20131945), whom the Hohmann Transfer\nis named after, see Chap. 4, distanced themselves from\nrocketry, wishing not to make this association. Von Braun\u2019s\ndecision to help the Army was, however, consistent with his\nfamily\u2019s strong tradition of undertaking public service roles1\n\nandmust correctly be viewed within the context of the day. By\nlate 1934, von Braun had developed the Aggregat-2, or A2,\nrocket and by the end of 1937 the much larger A3, planned as\na prototype of the A4, had been launched. However, the A3\nhad several difficulties, lacking the endurance, control and\naerodynamic performance that would be required for the\nsupersonic A4. As a result, the A4 was postponed and work\nprogressed to the smaller A5 in order to resolve the issues\nencountered with the A3. It is of interest to note that until 1939\nand the outbreak of World War II, von Braun was in occa-\nsional contact with Goddard, and indeed, many of Goddard\u2019s\nconcepts and ideas found their way into the Aggregat series of\nrockets. As World War II progressed, Adolf Hitler (1889\u2013\n1945), the then Chancellor of Germany (as F\u00fchrer und\n\nFig. 1.2 Frau im Mond movie\nposter (left) and a pre-\nvisualization painting of the\niconic shot from Le Voyage dans\nla lune of the rocket hitting the\neye of the Moon (right)\n\n1 The definitive English language biography of Von Braun is Michael J\nNeufeld\u2019s Von Braun\u2014dreamer of space, engineer of war.\n\n1 Introduction 3\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nReichskanzler), warmed to the rocket program and in\nDecember 1942 authorized the development of the A4 rocket\nas a weapon. Re-designated the V-2, the first production\nmissiles were complete in early 1944 and at least 5,000 V-2s\nwere produced by the end of the war. The Nordhausen (Mit-\ntelwerk) V-2 factory, along with other V-2 production sites,\nutilized slave labor, in this case from the nearby Mittelbau-\nDora concentration camps. It is believed that as many as\n20,000 prisoners died while working at the Nordhausen plant,\nwith as many as 9,000 of these dying from exhaustion. In fact,\nit is widely held that more people died building the V-2\nrockets than were killed by it as a weapon. The V-2 rocket was\nthe world\u2019s first long-range military-ballistic missile and the\nfirst known human artifact to achieve suborbital space flight.\nThe V-2 rocket is also the foundation on which most modern\nrockets are based, including those of the United States, the\nSoviet Union, and Europe\u2019s Ariane family.\n\nIn the final weeks and months of World War II the Allies\neach became increasingly keen to capture for themselves as\nmuch of the knowledge acquired by the V-2 program as\npossible, and to deny German engineering knowledge and\nexpertise to the other allied nations. However, von Braun\nmade the decision to surrender to the Americans rather than,\nas he saw the other options, be captured by the Soviets, or shot\nby the German command. Despite his status as a Schutzstaffel\n(SS) officer, rank Sturmbannf\u00fchrer, and direct links to slave\nlabor, von Braun and his team were \u2018bleached\u2019 of their Naz-\nism byUS forces and granted security clearance to work in the\nUS. The UK and Soviets also recovered a number of V-2\nrockets, with the UK launching three V-2\u2019s from Northern\nGermany however most of the senior engineers involved had\nby that stage already agreed to move to the US (Fig. 1.3).\n\nSubsequent to World War II it was assumed within the\nWest, and especially in the United States, that the US had\ngained a significant technological advantage over the Soviets\nby acquiring von Braun and his team. As a result of von\nBraun\u2019s surrender to the Americans the post-war develop-\nment of rocketry within the now Cold War enemies was\nnotably different and it could be argued would, in-effect, be\nto the long-term advantage of the Soviets with regard to\nrocket technology, skill-base and manufacturing. The\nAmericans launched several V-2 rockets in the post-war\nyears, notching up several firsts, including, the first scientific\nexperiment in space, a cosmic radiation experiment in May\n1946, and the first image of Earth taken from space (altitude\n105 km) in October of the same year on-board a V-2 rocket\nlaunched from White Sands Missile Range; seen in Fig. 1.4.\nA collage of images from a similar V-2 launch, this time on\nJuly 26, 1948 is shown in Fig. 1.5; the area shown in Fig. 1.5\nis approximately 200 million hectares, with a distance to the\nhorizon of over 1,000 km.\n\nIn 1947, the Soviets launched the R-1 rocket, which\nalthough only a direct copy of the V-2 rocket, based on the\n\nfew V-2s and associated staff the Soviets had recovered, had\nbeen manufactured by Soviet industry, and was not simply a\nre-assembled V-2. This learning process, together with the\nbrilliance of Sergei Korolev gave the Soviets critical expe-\nrience of the process required to build a rocket, enabling them\nto develop future rockets at a more rapid pace than the\nAmericans. Immediately following the R-1 launch the\nSoviets began work on the R-2 and R-5, based on extensions\nof the V-2 technology. By 1953 the Soviets, under the design\nlead of Korolev, often referred to only as \u2018Chief Designer\u2019 by\nthe Politburo, had begun work on the R-7 rocket, a significant\nstep beyond the German heritage of its predecessors and\nwhich later became the basis for the Soyuz launcher. The first\ntesting of the R-7 was conducted in May 1957 from what\nwould soon become Baikonur Cosmodrome, located about\n\nFig. 1.3 Wernher von Braun with a model of the V-2 rocket.

Macdonald et al.\n\n\n\n200 km east of the Aral Sea in present day Kazakhstan, and a\nmodified version was subsequently developed to launch\nSputnik-1. Nikita Khrushchev, the then leader of the USSR,\nhad wanted to launch Sputnik-1 on September 17, 1957 to\ncommemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of the birth of\nTsiolkovsky, but technical problems pushed this launch date,\nand the start of the Space Age, to October 4, 1957.\n\n1.1.2 Space Age (post-1957)\n\nBy the start of the Space Age the pioneering engineering\nphase of space technology development, as shown in\nFig. 1.1, was approaching its end, and phase 2, sustaining\nmastery, was on the horizon. Sputnik-1 was followed only\n30 days later by Sputnik-2. By the time the first American\nspacecraft, Explorer-1, was launched from Cape Canaveral\nAir Force Station Launch Complex 26 in Florida on\n1 February (UTC)/31 January 1958 at the launch site,\nSputnik-1 had, 26 days earlier reentered the Earth\u2019s atmo-\nsphere at the end of its mission. Just as Sputnik-1 marked the\nstart of the Space Age, Explorer-1 marked the start of the\nSpace Race.\n\nDuring these final years of space technology pioneering\nengineering an innumerable amount of technical firsts were\naccomplished. Amongst these highlights include the first\ncommunications spacecraft by Project SCORE (Signal\nCommunications Orbit Relay Equipment), in December\n1958; the first spacecraft to visit another celestial body in\n1959, when Luna-2 impacted the lunar surface in Mare Im-\nbrium, near the craters Aristillus, Archimedes, and Autolycus;\nthe first weather satellite, TIROS-1, in April 1960; and in June\nof the same year the first reconnaissance, or spy, satellite was\nlaunched by the Americans, the Galactic Radiation and\nBackground-1, or GRAB-1, shown in Fig. 1.6. Note that\nGalactic Radiation and Background was the covername for\nelectronic intelligence (ELINT) Project Dyno, operated by the\nU.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The first reconnais-\nsance satellite has been followed by a huge number of similar\nspacecraft and today, in addition to the classified militarily\noperated reconnaissance spacecraft, society is accustomed to\ntools such as Google Earth providing ready access to space-\nbased Earth observation images. Space-based reconnaissance\n\nis not however simply about taking images of the Earth,\nincluding as it does signals intelligence-gathering, as was the\ncase with GRAB-1, which can include communications as\nwell as technical and geolocation intelligence; see Sect. 1.2.4.\n\nIn 1962, Telstar-1 became the first active, direct-relay\ncommunications spacecraft. An indication of the social\nimpact of space technology around this time, and especially\nthe Telstar-1 spacecraft, can be gleamed from the official\nfootball of the 1970 FIFAWorld Cup in Mexico, the Adidas\nTelstar, named after the spacecraft; see Fig. 1.7. The Telstar\nfootball, now considered a design classic, was painted with\nblack and white panels to make it more visible on black-and-\nwhite television, making it look like the Telstar-1 spacecraft,\nwhich was roughly spherical and dotted with solar panels in\na similar fashion.\n\nBy the early 1960s space technology development had\nentered Phase 2, sustaining mastery, with the first geosyn-\nchronous spacecraft, see Sect. 4.4.3, Syncom-2 in 1963, and\nthe first geostationary spacecraft, see Sect. 4.4.3, Syncom-3 in\n1964, being closely followed by Intelsat-1, Early Bird, as the\nfirst commercial communications spacecraft in geostationary\norbit in April 1965. In the same month, the first Molniya\n(Mo????), see Sect. 4.4.6, spacecraft was also launched.\n\nOver the next twenty years spacecraft communications\ntechnology would revolutionize society and television,\nenabling 24 hour news, live sport coverage and instanta-\nneous global communication. The first national satellite TV\nnetwork was established in 1967 in the Soviet Union, using\nthe Molniya orbit, which had been pioneered only two and\nhalf years before. By 1976 the Soviets had developed the\nfirst operational Direct-to-Home TV communications\nspacecraft, Ekran (Russian: ??pa?, Screen), providing one\nTV channel and two radio channels, in the UHF range,\nbroadcasting direct to homes in northern Siberia. Through-\nout this period, several spacecraft had been to visit both\nVenus and Mars, including landers on both planets.\n\nBy the early 1980s, many spacecraft had been launched\ninto Earth orbit and systems such as the Tracking and Data\nRelay Satellite System (TDRSS) had spacecraft providing\nservices to other spacecraft, in this case a communications\nservice. It was also during this decade that the Space Shuttle\nbecame operational and throughout the 1980s the sustaining\nmastery phase of space technology\u2019s development was\n\nFig. 1.5 An image collage from a V-2 launch on July 26, 1948 from White Sands Missile Range at 100 km altitude.

By the close of the decade the\nflyby of Voyager-2 at Neptune meant that humans had vis-\nited every planet in the solar system.2\n\nThe commercialization of space began to truly gather\npace in the 1990s, with the development of the Ariane 4\nlaunch vehicle, Fig. 1.8, which captured over 50 % of the\ncommercial launch market, and the associated emergence of\na mass domestic market for Direct-to-Home TV. The 1990s\nalso saw the launch of the era-defining Hubble Space Tele-\nscope (HST), along with subsequent servicing missions of\nthis and other spacecraft by the Shuttle Orbiter. In 1994,\nanother ubiquitous feature of our modern lifestyles became\noperational; the Global Positioning System, GPS, a space-\nbased global navigation satellite system, GNSS, operated by\nthe US Department of Defense. Within 15 years of the GPS\nsystem becoming operational, several studies within the US\nestimated that 6\u20137 % of the Gross Domestic Product, GDP,\n\nFig. 1.8 The 1st Ariane 4 launch in June 1988.

Macdonald et al.\n\n\n\nof developed countries, and up to perhaps 10 % in the US\nand EU, could be classed as dependent on GPS [4].\n\nAs the Space Age approached the half-century it was\nclear, looking back, that the sustaining mastery phase of\ndevelopment was approaching its completion, with space\ntechnology now an integral facet of daily life, often taken for\ngranted and the importance of which was, and remains, often\noverlooked. Indeed, by the time the Space Age actually\nreached its half-century space technology, once the preserve\nof elite government research groups was accessible to stu-\ndent engineers and scientists through platforms such as\nCubeSats, the first of which were launched in 2003. Indeed,\nit could even be argued that missions such as NASA\u2019s\nMESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment,\nGEochemistry and Ranging), and the ESA/JAXA (Japan\nAerospace Exploration Agency) BepiColombo mission, both\nto Mercury, or the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity,\ntogether with recent successful developments in space\ntechnology by China, India, Brazil and others, demonstrate\nthe end of the sustaining mastery phase of space (robotic)\ntechnology development, and the beginning of the dimin-\nishing returns phase. That is, today, should humanity choose\nto do so, a robotic spacecraft could be placed into orbit\nabout, or onto the surface of, almost any planet in our solar\nsystem. Furthermore, inserting a spacecraft into Earth orbit,\nwhile not mundane, is considered by many to be a routine\nengineering activity, with commercially acceptable levels of\nrisk.\n\n1.1.3 The Future of Robotic Space Technology\n\nFuture forecasting is always unwise. However, as an engineer\nthe possible and perhaps even the probable can at least be\nidentified, hopefully without undue bias to preferable over\nprobable futures. History is of course, littered with over, and\nunder, optimistic predictions, and engineers are by their very\nnature largely a technologically optimistic band. Yet in 1961,\nthe same year as the first commercial communications satellite\nentered service in geostationary orbit, T.A.M. Craven, the\nCommissioner of the US governmental agency the Federal\nCommunications Commission, and an engineer by trade,\nstated \u201cThere is practically no chance communications space\nsatellites will be used to provide better telephone, telegraph,\ntelevision, or radio service inside the United States.\u201d\n\nIt would seem that the future of space technology could\ntake two possible paths. The first would be the business as\nusual route, taking the technology along the currently\nestablished technology trend, shown in Fig. 1.1, into the\ndiminishing returns phase. The second possible path is that a\nnew innovation leads to the establishment of a next gener-\nation technology curve, as shown in Fig. 1.1. While this may\n\nseem like hedging, it is not a matter of whether the second\npath will happen, but rather when, what requirement the new\ninnovation will fulfill, and hence what the key system level\ninnovation will be.\n\nAt present, spacecraft provide a vantage point to acquire\nand re-direct information; Earth observation, including mil-\nitary reconnaissance, telecommunications and science are all\ninformation services. Attempts to exploit microgravity and\nhard vacuum for scientific or commercial ends have had only\nlimited success. It can thus be theorized that the next gen-\neration of space technology will alter this in some way. To\nthis end, and borrowing the language of the Internet, the\ncurrent generation of space technology can be termed Space\n1.0, having created a basic in-orbit infrastructure and market\neconomy, much in the same way as the Web 1.0; Space 2.0\nwould then open up space access beyond the current national\nand international participants, exploiting and building on an\nestablished infrastructure. Some but not all consider that\nSpace 2.0 could therefore facilitate sharing, interoperability,\nuser-centered design and collaboration. It could also thus be\ncheaper, with shorter program durations enabled through a\nreliance on in-orbit infrastructure, services and products.\nFuture low-cost, responsive space missions could use in-\norbit infrastructure rather than build a complete new space-\ncraft. As such, the terrestrial concept of service utilities could\nexpand into space, with spacecraft becoming interdependent,\ninteroperable and increasingly specialized. The European\nData Relay Satellite (EDRS) program is an early example of\nhow this may work on a commercial basis. With such a\nmove, the in-orbit infrastructure could move towards a state\nof continuous evolution and maintenance, rather than the\ncurrent generational step-changes in capability. This type of\nservice-level evolution is already evident in the GPS system.\nHowever, presuming that the next generation space tech-\nnology curve were to begin today, then it must be presumed\nthat the pioneering engineering phase of this curve would\nextend for the next 20\u201340 years, and that, of course, assumes\nthat such innovations fulfill a suitable market requirement.\n\n1.1.4 Human Space Flight\n\nThe great romanticism of human space flight has sparked\nmany imaginations, Jules Verne\u2019s inspirational novel From\nthe Earth to the Moon was not about a mechanoid, or a\nrobotic Moon mission, but three human travelers.\nThroughout the works of Tsiolkovsky, Oberth, and his\ninvolvement in Frau im Mond, and onto von Braun, each\nhad a true fascination with human space flight. Similarly,\nKorolev\u2019s Sputnik program was, from the very start, about\nhuman space flight and not commercial exploitation, or\nscientific exploration of space.\n\n1 Introduction 7\n\n\n\nThe first living things intentionally sent into space were\nfruit flies, on-board a US launched V-2 rocket on February\n20, 1947. The rocket reached an altitude of 109 km in just\nover 3 min. During the descent the capsule was ejected, the\nparachutes successfully deployed and the fruit flies recovered\nalive. Several animals subsequently flew on suborbital arcs,\nincluding Albert II, a Rhesus Monkey, who became the first\nprimate in space on June 14, 1949. Sputnik-2, the second\never spacecraft to orbit the Earth carried the first animal to\norbit the Earth, a dog named Laika; a female part-Samoyed\nterrier. Laika however survived for only a few hours in orbit\ninstead of the planned ten days due to thermal control system\nissues and the stress of the experience.\n\nThe first test flight of the Soviet Vostok spacecraft was\nKorabl-Sputnik-1, also known as Sputnik-4 (Sputnik-3 was\na robotic spacecraft originally intended to be the first satel-\nlite). Despite the conspiracy theories, there is little reason to\ndoubt that this was an automated test flight, with Korabl-\nSputnik-2 (Sputnik-5), launched on August 19, 1960, being\nthe first spacecraft to safely return animals sent into orbit.\nKorabl-Sputnik-2 carried two dogs, Belka and Strelka, 40\nmice, and two rats, as well as a television camera that took\nimages of the dogs; it is of note that these images are often\nmistaken for images from Sputnik-2. It is also of note that\none of the dogs suffered seizures during the fourth orbital\nrevolution, as a direct result of this it was decided the first\nhuman flight should make no more than three revolutions of\nthe Earth. The first human space flight was subsequently\nachieved on April 12, 1961, with the launch of the Soviet\ncosmonaut Yuri Gagarin (1934\u20131968), who completed a\nsingle revolution about the Earth in Vostok-1 prior to reentry\n(Fig. 1.9).\n\nConsidering the development of human space flight, it is\napparent that by the time of Gagarin\u2019s flight, pioneering\n\nengineering was still very much the order of the day. Indeed it\nwould be the following February before America matched the\nfeat of human orbital space flight with the launch of John\nGlenn (born 1921). However, in November 1960, John F.\nKennedy was elected president of the US, promising supe-\nriority over the Soviet Union in both space exploration and\nmissile defense, and warning of a missile gap between the two\nnations. In fact, the missile gap was a figment of exaggerated\nintelligence estimates based largely on domestic US politics\nand inter-service budgetary tensions. However, despite this\nand Kennedy\u2019s own rhetoric it was actually the flight of\nGagarin that prompted Kennedy\u2019s support for the Apollo\nprogram which had been conceived early in 1960 during the\nadministration of Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890\u20131969).\nAnd, six weeks after Gagarin\u2019s flight, 20 days after Alan\nShepard had become the first American in space on a sub-\norbital flight and nine months before the first American\norbited the Earth, Kennedy committed the US to \u201cland a man\non the Moon and return him safely to the Earth\u201d, before the\nend of the decade. Such a goal was hugely ambitious,\nrequiring the US to commit the largest amount of resources\nby any nation in peacetime towards a single goal, reported to\nCongress as 25.4 billion USD in 1973, and in 2009, by\nNASA, as 170 billion USD in 2005 dollars; of course, this\nwas no ordinary peacetime (Fig. 1.10).\n\nReturning to the logistic curve of Fig. 1.1 it is apparent\nthat the Apollo program is too early. The political impera-\ntive placed on human space flight means a requirement\nemerges to develop sustained mastery of a narrow specific\napplication of political value, prior to completing the nec-\nessary pioneering engineering. As such, despite the clear\nand obvious technical achievements of the Apollo program,\nalong with its cultural impact, its long-term value is ques-\ntionable. Indeed, modern proposals from within the US to\n\nFig. 1.9 Yuri Gagarin. Image\nThe Russian State Archive of\nScientific and Technical\nDocumentation, RGANTD\n\n8 M. Macdonald et al.\n\n\n\nreturn to the Moon, such as NASA\u2019s canceled Constellation\nprogram, highlight the limited long-term value provided by\nthe Apollo program.\n\nThroughout the Apollo program, the Soviet Union, in\naddition to attempting its own, abortive human lunar pro-\ngram, continued to develop its Earth orbiting human space\nflight program. The Soviets built on early successes, work-\ning towards the development of the Soyuz capsule and\nlauncher, which first flew a cosmonaut into space in 1967\nkilling him and which continues today to operate as a\nderivative of this original vehicle. The first Soyuz flight,\nSoyuz-1, had an ambitious mission plan, including a ren-\ndezvous with Soyuz-2 however due to a range of technical\nissues this did not happen until Soyuz 4 and 5 flights. On\nreturn to Earth, cosmonaut Colonel Vladimir Komarov\n\n(1927\u20131967) died when the spacecraft crashed, becoming\nthe first in-flight fatality in the history of space flight. On\nApril 19, 1971 the Soviet Union launched Salyut-1 (DOS-1),\nthe first space station and the basis on which the Mir space\nstation was developed and operated from 1986\u20132001\n(Fig. 1.11). Following the cancelation of the Apollo pro-\ngram, the US developed Skylab, the first American space\nstation, which hosted three crewed missions in 1973\u20131974,\nand flew until 1979 bridging the gap from Saturn V and the\nApollo program to the Space Shuttle program. The Shuttle\nOrbiter flew from 1981\u20132011 and although once again a\nsignificant technical accomplishment, by the time it was\ndecommissioned the Americans had once again failed to\nsustain the technology in anything close to that of the by\nnow mature, established and work-horse Soyuz.\n\nFig. 1.10 A 1964 portrait of\nNeil Armstrong (left) and Buzz\nAldrin on the porch of the\nApollo-11 lunar module, Eagle\n(right).

Image NASA\n\n1 Introduction 9\n\n\n\nPrior to the retirement of the Shuttle Orbiter, it was largely\nresponsible for the establishment of the International Space\nStation, ISS; the most expensive international collaborative\nscientific endeavor ever undertaken by humanity, estimated\nto have a similar total cost to the Apollo program in real\nterms. On orbit construction began in 1998 and was almost\ncompleted by the final Shuttle Orbiter missions over a decade\nlater (one large and a few small Russian elements of the ISS\nwere still on the ground when the Shuttle fleet was retired)\n(Fig. 1.12).\n\n1.1.5 The Future of Human Space Flight\nTechnology\n\nThe technology development of human space flight and its\nposition on the logistic curve of Fig. 1.1 is difficult to\naccurately quantify. The Soviet Union, and now Russia, has\ncertainly developed a sustained mastery of low-Earth orbital\nflight with the Soyuz, which has effectively been operational\nfor well over 40 years. Meanwhile the US has failed to build\nsuch a distinguished heritage of human space flight tech-\nnology and the safety record of the Shuttle Orbiter was\ndisappointingly poor. However, there should be little doubt\nthat the US has a significant level of mastery of this tech-\nnology, if not the politics associated with it. Beyond the two\ntraditional powers, China was the third nation to develop an\nindependent human space flight capability in 2003, using the\nSoyuz spacecraft\u2019s heritage. However, they, together with\nthe other emerging powers, cannot yet be classed as anything\nother than exactly that, and it will take a significant period of\ntime for mastery of the technology to be established.\n\nIt is therefore likely that the immediate future destination\nof human orbital space flight is the ISS and low-Earth orbit.\nProviding humanity with a chance to develop a globally\nsustained mastery of the required technologies for humans to\nlive in space for prolonged periods, while understanding the\nphysiological and psychological effects of such expeditions,\n\nwith some important exceptions such as exploring how arti-\nficial gravity can alleviate those physiological effects. Only\nafter humanity has mastered the technology of low-Earth orbit\ncan it consider moving beyond this. However, in a memo-\nrandum from Robert S. McNamara, the then US Defense\nSecretary, and James E. Webb, the then NASA administrator,\nto Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, dated May 8, 1961, a\nmere 17 days before Kennedy announced the Apollo program\nto the US Congress, it was argued that achievements in space\n\u201csymbolize the technological power and organizing capacity\nof a nation\u201d [5]. Hence, it must be recognized that the\nromanticism of human space flight, along with the perceived\nnational prestige, have held, and will continue to hold, the\ninterest of politicians, securing funding for engineering, sci-\nence and mathematics research and educational programs.\nHence, even if the concept that human space flight \u201cneeds\nsomewhere to go\u201d is from a bygone Cold War era of a race for\npolitical ideological superiority, the principle of human space\nflight beyond the Earth\u2019s gravity well will always have sig-\nnificant value beyond the feat itself.\n\n1.2 Applications of Space Technology\n\nThe US National Space Policy [6] distinguishes three types\nof space activity, commercial, civil, and national security.\nThat categorization is followed in this Handbook with the\nexception that \u2018science\u2019 applications are removed from the\n\u2018civil\u2019 category and treated as a separate, fourth, category.\n\n1.2.1 Civil\n\nCivil space flight covers publicly funded space programs\nthat do not inherently address scientific or security objec-\ntives. The wide range of applications in this category is\nillustrated by the following examples, each of which will be\ndescribed in more detail\n\nFig. 1.12 Europe\u2019s Columbus\nLaboratory attached to the\nInternational Space Station.\nImage NASA\n\n10 M. Macdonald et al.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Human space flight\n\u2022 Operational meteorology\n\u2022 Search and rescue\n\u2022 Technology demonstration\n\u2022 Education.\n\n1.2.1.1 Human Space Flight\nSince Yuri Gagarin orbited the Earth on April 12, 1961 more\nthan 500 people have been in space. The US, Russia, Japan,\nEurope and Canada undertake the vast majority of current\nhuman space flight activities and, as discussed in Sect. 1.1.5,\ncurrently focus most of their efforts on a collaborative\nendeavor centered on the International Space Station.\n\nHaving taken more than a decade to assemble, the ISS has\nnow entered its operational phase. It provides facilities for\nthe following main areas of research [7]:\n\n\u2022 Biology and Biotechnology\u2014In microgravity, controls on\nthe directionality and geometry of cell and tissue growth\ncan be dramatically different to those on Earth. Various\nexperiments have used the culture of cells, tissues and\nsmall organisms in orbit as a tool to increase our under-\nstanding of biological processes in microgravity.\n\n\u2022 Physical Sciences\u2014The space station provides the only\nplace to study long-term physical effects in the absence of\ngravity. This unique microgravity environment allows\ndifferent physical properties to dominate systems, and\nthese have been harnessed for a wide variety of physical\nsciences.\n\n\u2022 Multipurpose\u2014From freezers and incubators, to glove\nboxes and complete racks, standard multi-purpose facilities\nsupport a wide range of research on-board the space station.\n\n\u2022 Earth and Space Science\u2014The presence of the space\nstation in low-Earth orbit provides a vantage point for\ncollecting Earth and space science data. The largest space\nscience facility on the station is the AMS-02 (see below).\n\n\u2022 Human Research\u2014The space station is being used to study\nthe risks to human health that are inherent in space explo-\nration, especially as concerns long-duration residence in a\n\nmicrogravity environment. This research is also relevant to\nthe study of some Earth-bound conditions such as the\neffects of long bed rest, osteoporosis and diseases such as\nbone marrow depletion.\n\n\u2022 Technology\u2014Studies on the space station can test a variety\nof technologies, systems, and materials that will be needed\nfor future long-duration exploration missions.\n\n\u2022 Educational Activities\u2014Station educational activities have\nhad a positive impact on thousands of students by\ninvolving them in station research, and by using the station\nto teach them the science and engineering that are behind\nspace exploration. Long-term benefits include inspiring\nstudents to excel in mathematics and science.\n\nThe Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) was deliv-\nered to the International Space Station on Space Shuttle\nEndeavour\u2019s last mission (flight STS-134) in 2011. AMS is a\nparticle physics detector, designed to search for various types\nof unusual matter by measuring cosmic rays. AMS-02 weighs\njust less than 7 metric tons, uses 2 kWof electrical power, and\nhas a design operational lifespan of a decade. The design and\ndevelopment was led by MIT Professor and Physics Nobel\nLaureate Samuel Ting (1936\u2013present). AMS-02 is the most\nsignificant attempt to-date to measure high-energy cosmic\nrays directly\u2014instead of via the secondary or tertiary prod-\nucts of their collisions with Earth\u2019s atmosphere (Fig. 1.13).\n\nChina has a separate and active human space flight pro-\ngram, while India has begun a similar program and Iran has\nstated that it plans to follow suit. China\u2019s human space flight\nprogram began in 2003 with the flight of Y\u00e1ng L\u00ecw?i (born\n1965) in Shenzou-5 (Divine Ship) for 21 h. Of note, official\nEnglish-language texts issued by the government of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China use the term \u2018astronaut\u2019 to\ndescribe professional space travelers from China. However,\nthe term \u2018taikonaut\u2019, a hybridization of the Chinese term\n\u2018taikong\u2019 (space) and the Greek \u2018naut\u2019 (sailor), is often used\nby English-language news media organizations and likely has\nits origins in the term \u2018t\u00e0ik?ng r\u00e9n\u2019, \u2018spaceman\u2019, used in\nTaiwan (formally the Republic of China) and Hong Kong\n\nFig. 1.13 Starboard truss of the International Space Station on 20 May 2011, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) is visible at center left\n(left) and a computer generated image of the AMS-02 (right). Image NASA\n\n1 Introduction 11\n\n\n\n(a special administrative region of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina) to mean professional space travelers. Meanwhile in\nChinese the terms \u2018y? hang yu\u00e1n\u2019 (Chinese: ???), and\n\u2018h\u00e1ng ti?n yu\u00e1n\u2019 (Chinese: ???), both meaning \u2018astro-\nnaut\u2019, have been used historically to describe professional\nspace travelers and recently some influential English lan-\nguage media organizations, such as the BBC, have begun to\nuse the transliteration \u2018yuhangyuan\u2019 rather than the term\n\u2018astronaut\u2019. In a steadily paced program, China gradually\nincreased the scale of its human space flight missions from its\nfirst flight in 2003 through to demonstrating extra-vehicular\nactivity, EVA, capabilities during Shenzhou-7 in 2008, and\nthe autonomous docking of spacecraft, initially with the\ncrewless Shenzhou-8 with the much larger Tiangong-1\nmodule in 2011, and the crewed Shenzhou-9 in 2012.\n\n1.2.1.2 Operational Meteorology\nAs already mentioned, the first weather satellite, TIROS-1,\nwas launched in 1960 by the US, demonstrating the value of\nspace-based observations to assist weather forecasters.\n\nToday, a fleet of satellites owned by seven countries and\nregions (Europe is counted as a single region in this tally)\nmonitor the Earth\u2019s weather on a routine basis from two\nbasic orbital positions\u2014near-polar orbits of about 900 km\naltitude and geosynchronous orbits 36,000 km above the\nEarth, see Fig. 1.14 [8].\n\nThe dependence of medium term (five to 30 days)\nweather forecasts on satellite data is illustrated in Fig. 1.15,\nwhich shows the increasing dominance of satellite data in the\nforecasts of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather\nForecasts (ECMWF). The dominance is even larger than at\nfirst glance because the \u2018conventional\u2019 graph includes\nAtmospheric Motion Vectors (AMV\u2014in other words, wind\nvectors) calculated by tracking cloud movements in satellite\nimages. ECMWF found that the conventional data alone\ngave such poor results that it was necessary to add the AMV\ndata in order to get a basic forecast against which the benefit\nof adding other satellite data could be assessed.\n\nThe satellite data considered essential for modern weather\nforecasting include (items in brackets are slightly less essential)\n\nFig. 1.14 Schematic of the\nworld\u2019s operational weather\nsatellites in early 2011.

Macdonald et al.\n\n\n\n\u2022 (At least six) geostationary satellites each with\n\u2013 Visible/infrared multi-spectral imager\n\u2013 (Infrared hyper-spectral sounder)\n\u2013 (Lightning imager)\n\n\u2022 Polar orbiting sun-synchronous satellites (in 3 orbital\nplanes) each with:\n\u2013 Visible/infrared multi-spectral imager\n\u2013 Microwave sounder\n\u2013 Infrared (hyper-spectral) sounder.\n\nOther sensors of demonstrated interest to weather fore-\ncasters include microwave imagers, scatterometers, radio\noccultation (constellation), altimeter (constellation), infrared\nimager (for sea surface temperature), more and advanced\nversions of the visible/infrared imagers (for ocean color and\nland cover), precipitation radars, broadband visible/infrared\nradiometers (for radiation budget), instruments to monitor\natmospheric constituents, and imaging radar.\n\nFuture space-based sensors which may enter operational\nuse include Doppler wind lidar, low frequency microwave\nradiometer (for salinity and soil moisture), gravimetric sen-\nsors (for water), microwave imager/sounder in geostationary\norbit (for precipitation), advanced imagers in geostationary\norbit and imagers on satellites in other orbits (e.g., elliptical,\nhigh inclination) [9].\n\n1.2.1.3 Search and Rescue, SAR\nAbout a dozen polar orbiting satellites carry equipment to\ndetect emergency transmissions from Cospas-Sarsat beacons\n\u2014this number will increase dramatically when the Galileo\nnavigation system is deployed (see Sect. 1.2.2), ensuring\nimmediate detection of an alert anywhere in the world. The\nmajority of the emergencies are at sea, but some are also\nfrom people in distress on land or in aircraft. Each ship,\nplane or other user purchases the special beacon, which in\nsome circumstances is mandatory. Alerts detected by Co-\nspas-Sarsat are passed to search and rescue authorities in the\n41 participating countries. An overview of the SAR events\nassisted by Cospas-Sarsat between 1994 and 2011 is shown\nin Fig. 1.16, data from [10]. It is noted that a possible\nexplanation for the reduction in SAR events in 2009 was the\n\nphasing out of the 121.5 MHz alert system in February of\nthat year, at which point the beacon population was esti-\nmated at nearly half a million, or about 30 % of all beacons.\n\n1.2.1.4 Technology Demonstration\nMany countries test technology in orbit before using it\noperationally. The items to be tested may be piggy-backed on\na satellite dedicated to other purposes or may occupy a special\nsatellite dedicated to the testing of technologies. The justifi-\ncation for placing an object in orbit just to test it is that ground\ntesting cannot replicate the conditions in space accurately. For\nexample, simulating zero-gravity on Earth is only possible for\nshort periods, so any equipment for which zero-gravity may\nprove problematic needs to be proven in orbit.\n\nIn general, a purchaser of an expensive satellite will feel\nmore confident of its success if all of its components and\nsubsystems are of a design that has previously been orbited\nsuccessfully. Similarly, the credentials of a designer or\nmanufacturer, especially one with little or no record of\naccomplishment, will be enhanced by successful flight of\nequipment on a test satellite.\n\n1.2.1.5 Education\nBesides acting as an inspiration for students, space contrib-\nutes directly to education primarily in the form of telecom-\nmunications. India has found the use of satellites for\ncommunicating with widely dispersed schools so beneficial\nthat the EDUSAT satellite, or GSAT-3, was launched in 2004\nand is dedicated to linking schools across the sub-continent\n\u2014sometimes referred to as tele-education, analogous to tele-\nmedicine in the medical arena. Edusat is part of a long-term\ncommitment of India\u2019s space agency, ISRO, to using satel-\nlites for education.\n\n1.2.2 Commercial\n\n1.2.2.1 Satellite Communications and Broadcasting\nWorld-wide commercial space activities were valued at 304\nbillion USD in 2013, an increase of 7 % over the previous\nyear, and comprised of 226 billion USD for commercial\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nNumber\n\nNumber of SAR Events\n\nNumber of Persons Rescued\n\nFig. 1.16 Number of SAR\nevents and persons rescued with\nthe assistance of Cospas-Sarsat\nalert data (121.5 and 406 MHz)\nbetween January 1994 and\nDecember 2011\n\n1 Introduction 13\n\n\n\ninfrastructure, support industries, space products and ser-\nvices, and 78 billion USD for government space budgets\n[11]. Direct-to-Home television services represent the largest\nsector of this activity, while other sectors include broadband\ncommunications, navigation, remote sensing (Earth obser-\nvation), space tourism, and microgravity, each of which is\noutlined in one of the following sections.\n\nThe main reasons why satellites are attractive for com-\nmunications and broadcasting include the following\n\n\u2022 Coverage over regions varying in size from a city to a\ncontinent via a single space-based hub (transmitter/recei-\nver) where the alternatives require either thousands of\nEarth-bound hubs, or wires and cables connected to every\nconsumer.\n\u2013 A satellite solution therefore is often cheaper and/or\n\nfaster to deploy and causes less disruption (digging up\nroads, constructing hubs, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Licensing of a single wide-area satellite may be simpler\nthan licensing a multitude of Earth-bound mini-systems to\nprovide the same coverage.\n\u2013 Examples abound of satellites being used to establish\n\ncommunications between widely separated countries\navoiding the fees, licensing and other commercial and\nregulatory barriers associated with using terrestrial\nlinks.\n\n\u2022 Full quality communication with ships, planes and land\nvehicles far from terrestrial infrastructure is readily pro-\nvided by satellites where the alternatives such as short\nwave radio are unreliable and/or of low quality.\n\u2013 The rapid provision of temporary links to anywhere in\n\nthe world is especially attractive to the news and sports\nmedia.\n\n\u2013 Communication with other satellites, typically to relay\ninformation beyond the line of sight, is primarily a\npublic sector service (principally for military and\nhuman space flight missions) but the European Data\nRelay Satellite (EDRS) program is an attempt to place\nsuch a service on a commercial footing.\n\n\u2022 International spectrum regulations define certain spectral\nbands for satellite services which satellites can use either\nonce per region with a single beam or multiple times via\nspot beams that can be as small as city-sized.\n\n\u2022 Geostationary satellites are especially attractive for com-\nmercial services since a single satellite can provide com-\nmunications and broadcasting services.\n\u2013 Low-Earth orbit satellites benefit from a much shorter\n\ntransmission distance but a constellation of several tens\nof satellites is required to ensure continuous service of\nall parts of the globe thus requiring close to the full\nconstellation to be in place before 24 hour service can\nbe offered\u2014a much more expensive investment than a\nsingle geostationary satellite.\n\nSatellite TV subscriptions are forecast to continue to\ngrow, especially in Asia\u2013Pacific (e.g. India) so that devel-\noping countries will represent 70 % of subscriptions by\n2020, up from 45 % in 2010 [12]. Satellite broadband is also\nforecast to grow nearly ten-fold by 2018, especially in North\nAmerica [13]. Mobile satcom terminal numbers are expected\nto double by 2020 especially in Machine-to-Machine (M2M,\nasset tracking/telemetry) applications, and mobile broadband\nis forecast to grow to about 10 % of mobile terminal num-\nbers by 2020 from zero in 2008\u2014and much more than 10 %\nin terms of revenue [14]. The provision of broadband via\nsatellite to homes and businesses has given rise to the first\nsatellites with capacity exceeding 100 Gbps. Examples\ninclude the 140 Gbps satellite Viasat-1, launched in October\n2011, which provides downloads in the range of 8\u201312 Mbps\nfor users. As of 2011, the bandwidth capacity offered by the\nworld commercial satcom market is split across the spectrum\nroughly as follows: Ka band is 20 %, Ku band is 50 %, C\nband is 20 % and L, S and X bands together are 10 % [15].\n\n1.2.2.2 Global Navigation Satellite System\nThe expensive investment required to deploy a constellation\nof non-geostationary satellites was mentioned in the previ-\nous section. For satellite-based navigation this investment\nhas been made by several governments around the world; the\nworld\u2019s main satellite-based navigation systems are listed in\nTable 1.1, from [16]. Non-military users world-wide are\nbenefitting from the free availability of the Global Naviga-\ntion Satellite System (GNSS) signal in space, and as previ-\nously mentioned up to perhaps 6\u201310 % of the GDP of\ndeveloped countries may be classed as dependent on GNSS.\n\nMass-market GNSS receivers are often embedded in a\ngeneral purpose device such as a mobile phone. Many others\nare tailored for use in vehicles and packaged with a general\npurpose microprocessor containing a digital map, a route\noptimization algorithm, a map-matching algorithm (adjusts the\nuser\u2019s location to be on a road), databases of places of interest,\na touch screen, etc. The fusion of satellite navigation with these\nother mass market devices means that the number of users with\nsuitably equipped devices is in the hundreds of millions,\nalthough the number of, for example, phone users who actively\nuse the GNSS functionality is difficult to measure.\n\nThe features of a satellite solution for navigation that\nmake it attractive include\n\n\u2022 A single system works anywhere in the world (with a view\nof the sky) thus reducing the investment of the receiver\nmanufacturers.\n\n\u2022 The space infrastructure is funded by either the military or\nhigh-value commercial contracts, providing a free, but\ndegraded public-service.\n\n\u2022 The accuracy is in the meter range, compared to 50 m to\n1 km from cell phone-based techniques.\n\n14 M. Macdonald et al.\n\n\n\n\u2022 The GPS system is receive-only thus eliminating the need\nfor transmission (transmission is inherently more energy\nintensive than reception).\n\u2013 The Cospas-Sarsat system requires the user to transmit\n\nan emergency message.\n\u2022 The receive-only aspect of GPS means that the privacy of\nusers is protected\u2014in contrast for example to using the\nmobile phone network to locate a user, which by definition\nmakes that location known to the mobile network.\n\n1.2.2.3 Earth Observation\nA space-based sensor for observing the Earth has many\nattractions in the commercial sector\n\n\u2022 Once the satellite is deployed it can take as many images\nas required each time it views the area of interest\u2014unlike\nan aircraft-borne sensor which requires a dedicated flight\nof the aircraft each time.\n\n\u2022 A geostationary satellite can provide continuous viewing\nof a large part of the globe.\n\u2013 The 36,000 km altitude of such a satellite makes imagery\n\nof better than about 1 km resolution challenging.\n\u2022 Satellites do not require legal authorization to view the\nEarth thus making it possible to view any country and to\n\nview across borders (for example to analyze geological\nstructures or water resources).\n\nOf course, there are many disadvantages to using a\nsatellite to observe the Earth, including\n\n\u2022 The large distance (a typical observing satellite is in orbit\nat an altitude of 600\u2013800 km).\n\n\u2022 The need for sunlight and cloud free skies\n\u2013 Imaging radar sensors offer a solution to this but they\n\nare more expensive than optical sensors and provide\nvery different information.\n\n\u2013 Infrared sensors can provide night-time images but with\nless resolution and contrast than images from similarly\npriced visible light sensors.\n\n\u2022 The sometimes long delays between revisits to the same\narea.\n\u2013 Satellite constellations such as RapidEye are intended to\n\naddress this problem.\n\u2022 The extra cost of a satellite sensor over that of an aircraft-\nborne one because for example it has to work in vacuum\nand zero-gravity without maintenance, to survive launcher\nvibrations, to be miniaturized and designed to use minimal\nelectrical power, etc.\n\nTable 1.1 The world\u2019s main satellite navigation systems as of 2013\n\nUS: Global Positioning System (GPS)\n\n24 satellites are the minimum required to provide continuous worldwide service. Each satellite circles the Earth in about 12 h at an altitude of\n20,000 km. Some transmissions are encrypted and on special frequencies intended for military users\n\nUS/Europe/Japan/India: Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)/EGNOS/MSAS/GAGAN\n\nThe Federal Aviation Authority operates WAAS as an adjunct to GPS, alerting users in the US (including Hawaii and the southern half of Alaska)\nwithin 6 s if any GPS satellite is not working properly, and providing users with information to reduce the errors, especially those caused by\nelectrical storms in the ionosphere. Geostationary satellites are used to get the WAAS information to users rapidly and over a wide area. EGNOS,\nMSAS and GAGAN are the equivalent GPS augmentation systems in Europe, Japan and India\n\nRussia: GLONASS\n\nGLONASS operates on a similar principle to GPS, with satellites about 19,000 km above the Earth orbiting every 11\u00bc hours. 24 satellites are\nneeded for a continuous world-wide service. Some transmissions are encrypted and on special frequencies intended for military users\n\nEurope: Galileo\n\nDue to enter limited-global service in 2014 and to be complete around 2020, Galileo is similar to GPS, with an eventual 30 satellites 23,000 km\nabove the Earth orbiting every 14\u00bc hours. Uniquely among global coverage systems, Galileo will operate on a commercial basis with some\ntransmissions encrypted and on special frequencies intended for subscription-based users\n\nChina: BeiDou-2 (or Compass )\n\nBegan offering location, timing and navigation services to China and surrounding areas in late 2011, targeting global coverage by 2020; uses a\nmix of geostationary, geosynchronous and GPS-like orbits. As with GPS and GLONASS, some transmissions will be encrypted and on special\nfrequencies intended for military users\n\nIndia: IRNSS\n\nSeven satellites will be placed in geosynchronous orbit by approximately 2014 to offer GPS-type signals over the South Asia region\n\nJapan: QZSS\n\nThree geosynchronous satellites will provide GPS-type signals plus some messaging services over the Japanese region. The first satellite was\nlaunched in 2010\n\nInternational: Cospas-Sarsat\n\nTwelve satellites currently carry the equipment to pick up signals from special Cospas-Sarsat emergency beacons\n\n1 Introduction 15\n\n\n\nFor these and other reasons the commercial Earth\nobservation market had taken 20 years to reach world-wide\nsales of about $100 million at the turn of the century. In the\nfirst decade of the 21st century, it has grown ten-fold to more\nthan $1 billion per annum aided by the following factors\n\n\u2022 The US military and intelligence agencies decided to\noutsource their requirement for imagery of the 50 cm\nresolution class to industry, offering decade-long multi-\nbillion dollar contracts to two companies, GeoEye and\nDigitalGlobe.\n\u2013 The same US government agencies have also outsour-\n\nced some of their requirement for 1 m class imaging\nradar to three non-American satellite companies but\nover a shorter (3 year) period and with a funding level\nthat is two orders of magnitude smaller.\n\n\u2022 Google has made imagery of the whole Earth available to\nInternet users free of charge, thus familiarizing millions of\npeople with space-based imagery.\n\u2013 Google Earth imagery is from a mix of satellite- and\n\naircraft-borne sensors (the latter especially in developed\nregions).\n\n\u2022 The cost of space-based sensors with a useful imaging\ncapability has fallen sharply driven by advances in digital\nelectronics and cameras.\n\u2013 About 20 countries now operate their own imaging\n\nsatellites that provide imagery with better than 5 m\nresolution and more countries are set to join this com-\nmunity in the coming decade.\n\nImagery of the Earth is used in a myriad of applications.\nEarly adopters included the farming and mineral exploration\nsectors, but today the list of users is extremely broad since to\nsome extent every visitor to Google Earth is a user whatever\nthe reason for that visit. In general, Earth imagery is used to\nmake, update or enhance maps\u2014increasingly digital maps.\nThe wide area form of space-based imagery is ideal for\nmapping. Stereo imagery is available from several satellite\noperators, easing the identification of map features. Analysis\nof optical or radar imagery of an area taken from two dif-\nferent angles allows the height of the surface to be mapped,\ni.e. provides a 3-D map. By 2011, the state-of-the-art world-\nwide 3-D map was is probably the map developed from the\noptical images of JAXA\u2019s ASTER optical sensor on NASA\u2019s\nTerra satellite. That should be eclipsed in 2014 by one based\non imaging radar data from the German commercial Terra-\nSAR-X and Tandem-X satellites\u2014it promises to provide a\nglobal map with 2 m local accuracy and 12 m granularity.\n\nA new form of observation from space has been dem-\nonstrated by the US Gravity Recovery and Climate Experi-\nment (GRACE) satellite. In the first 5 years of the mission,\nGRACE measured the Earth\u2019s gravity field with unprece-\ndented accuracy and detected significant changes in gravity\n\nover certain regions of the Earth. Over northern India and\nsouthern California analysis of the change in gravity sug-\ngested a reduction in the underground freshwater aquifers in\nthose regions. Over Greenland, the changes indicated a loss\nof glacial ice that correlated well with estimates based on\nsatellite altimetry and other measurements [17].\n\n1.2.2.4 Space Tourism\nIn addition to the more than 500 state-sponsored astronauts\nand cosmonauts who have been in space, a handful of pri-\nvate individuals have paid to do the same\u2014the price tag for\na few days in orbit is typically 20 million USD, or more.\nSuch individuals are termed \u2018space flight participants\u2019 to\ndistinguish them, and other special travelers, from the career\nastronauts who form the crew of such flights.\n\nSuborbital tourismwill soon be offered at a price two orders\nof magnitude less. Virgin Galactic or Space Expedition Cor-\nporation (SXC), using the XCORAerospace Lynx horizontal-\ntakeoff, horizontal-landing (HTHL), rocket-powered space-\nplane, are likely to be the first operator of such a service with\noperational flights due to start, perhaps, in the 2014\u20132015\nperiod. Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo service builds on\ntechnology developed by Scaled Composites Inc. in winning\nthe suborbital rocket X-Prize in 2004\u2014an air-launched rocket\nplane tops out above 110 km altitude before gliding back to\nland. The passengers experience about 10 min of weight-\nlessness. Other potential suborbital space tourism operators\nare waiting in the wings to see how Virgin Galactic\u2019s business\ndevelops. Such technology and business development could\noffer a route towards point-to-point suborbital space flight.\n\n1.2.2.5 Microgravity\nThe lack of gravity in space suggests the possibility of\ncreating ultra-pure materials such as crystals, lenses and\nsemiconductors, or of growing plants with unusual proper-\nties. Many of the required facilities exist on the International\nSpace Station, and now that the station is fully assembled the\nopportunity is there for the commercial sector to grasp. It\nremains to be seen whether a market in microgravity activ-\nities will develop.\n\n1.2.3 Science\n\nIn the context of space flight (excluding human space flight),\nscience can be broadly considered as split into looking\noutwards for astronomy and space science, and looking\ndownwards to the Earth.\n\n1.2.3.1 Astronomy and Space Science\nThe following are some of the reasons to do astronomy in\nspace despite the inherent high costs involved\n\n16 M. Macdonald et al.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Observe the sky in those parts of the electromagnetic\nspectrum that are absorbed by the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\u2013 Ultraviolet, X-ray and gamma ray at the wavelengths\n\nshorter than visible light observing high-energy events\nsuch as supernovas.\n\n\u2013 Infrared and millimeter wave at longer wavelengths\nobserving cooler and lower energy events, or events that\nhave been red-shifted by the Doppler effect caused by\ntheir rapid movement away from Earth (this last being\none of the main justifications for the James Webb Space\nTelescope).\n\n\u2013 Examples of the many satellites benefitting from this\nlack of atmospheric absorption feature include XMM-\nNewton (ESA X-ray), Compton (NASA gamma ray),\nSpitzer (NASA infrared) and Planck (ESA millimeter\nwavelength).\n\n\u2022 Observe in visible light without the blurring and dimming\ncaused by the Earth\u2019s atmosphere; the Hubble Space\nTelescope (NASA/ESA) is the best-known example of a\nsatellite exploiting this feature of space. Note that ground-\nbased telescopes are increasingly able to eliminate atmo-\nsphere-induced blurring by detecting and counteracting the\nmovement of the atmosphere\u2014techniques used to coun-\nteract include moving the optics, termed adaptive optics,\nor the detector or the detected image in a computer, the\napproach taken is similar to the anti-shake feature in a\nmass market digital camera.\n\n\u2022 Observe the full sky simultaneously with a single instru-\nment. A full-sky survey requires at least two ground-based\ntelescopes, one in the northern and the other in the southern\nhemisphere, making it difficult to compile a rigorous map of\nthe sky. ESA\u2019s Hipparcos provided the best reference star\ncatalog to date when it was released, because of its ability to\nobserve the complete sky and this will be improved only\nwhen ESA\u2019s Gaia full-sky survey is complete.\n\n\u2022 Perform ultra-stable measurements of the Sun and other\ncelestial sources of radiation, avoiding the uncertainty\nintroduced by radiation traversing the atmosphere. As an\nexample, the ERB/ACRIM series and other instruments\nflown on a variety of satellites for the past 30 years have\nprovided the current best measurement of total solar output.\n\n\u2022 Perform measurements of the solar system and beyond\nusing an observing baseline greater than the Earth\u2019s\ndiameter. Spacecraft such as NASA\u2019s twin STEREO (Solar\nTErrestrial RElations Observatory) probes have been\nplaced to observe the Sun from vantage points that are\ndifferent from that available on Earth. Interferometric\nobservations have not yet been undertaken with this sort of\nbaseline.\n\n\u2022 Analyze the space environment around the Earth (particles\nand fields)\u2014more than 100 satellites and space probes\nhave undertaken this type of measurement\u2014to character-\nize the Earth-Sun system;\n\n\u2022 Visit the planets, moons and other regions of the solar\nsystem, make in situ measurements (particles, fields,\nimages, gravity, chemistry, geology, atmosphere, etc.) and/\nor return them to Earth. Spacecraft have now visited all the\nplanets and several minor planets, asteroids and comets.\nAll the planets except Uranus and Neptune have had\nspacecraft placed in orbit around them. Probes have landed\non the surface of Mars, Venus and Saturn\u2019s moon Titan.\nVarious samples have been returned to Earth from the\nMoon, while the Stardust space probe in 2006 became\nthe first to collect and return samples of a comet, while\npassing through the coma of comet Wild 2, along with\ncosmic dust samples. Similarly, the Hayabusa space probe\nperformed the first sample return from an asteroid in 2010,\ncollecting and returning tiny grains of material from 25143\nItokawa. The Voyager-1 and Voyager-2 spacecraft reached\nthe heliosheath region of the outer solar system in 2004\nand 2007, respectively, where the solar wind slows from\nsupersonic to subsonic speed, with Voyager-1 leaving the\nsolar system on 25 August 2012;\n\n\u2022 Measure cosmic rays directly\u2014ground-based methods\ninvolve the detection of secondary or tertiary products of the\ncollision of cosmic rays with the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The\n6\u00be metric ton Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02)\ndeployed on the International Space Station in 2011 is the\nmost powerful instrument orbited for this purpose (at least\nsince the Soviet\u2019s 16 ton Proton 4 that spent 8 months in\norbit in 1968\u20131969), see Sect. 1.2.1.\n\n1.2.3.2 Earth Science\nSpace-based sensors can be an attractive way to undertake\nEarth science because of the following factors\n\n\u2022 Viewed from space, large-scale geological, meteorological,\nhydrological, marine and biological phenomena become\nmore apparent than when viewed from lower altitude.\n\n\u2022 Hard-to-access regions of the world such as the polar\nregions can be extensively observed without compromis-\ning human safety.\n\n\u2022 The top and upper regions of the atmosphere can be observed.\n\u2022 The Earth\u2019s gravity field can be observed on a larger scale\nand more comprehensively than is possible on the ground.\n\n\u2022 Observations over the oceans (for example of sea surface\ntemperature) can be undertakenmore comprehensively than\nis affordable using surface, airborne or sub-sea sensors.\n\n\u2022 Altimetry from space provides information on sea level,\nglacier extent/volume, and similar phenomena that are\nimpossible or very difficult to measure any other way.\n\n\u2022 As new techniques are devised to measure phenomena of\ninterest, space-based sensors provide a rapid means of\nachieving their deployment on a global-scale. Examples\ninclude atmospheric trace constituents, marine pollution\nand currents, and the thickness and age of ice.\n\n1 Introduction 17\n\n\n\nMost space-faring nations have placed instruments in\norbit that exploit some of the above factors. Climate change\nand other aspects of man\u2019s impact on the planet (deforesta-\ntion, desertification, over-extraction of water, etc.) is driving\nmany countries to increase the type and number of space-\nbased sensors to monitor that impact [18].\n\n1.2.4 National Security\n\nMilitary space activities account for around one-fifth of the\nworld\u2019s space economy. The activity is dominated by the US\nmilitary, with typically more than double NASA\u2019s budget.\nThe range of applications covers telecommunications, nav-\nigation, and various forms of surveillance and missile\ndefense, each of which is discussed below. Monitoring of the\nthreat from meteoroids and asteroids (Near Earth Objects,\nNEOs) is a special form of national security and is treated in\nthis section.\n\n1.2.4.1 Military Satellite Communications\nThe US, Russia, China, France, North Atlantic Treaty Orga-\nnization (NATO), Germany, Spain and theUK deploymilitary\ncommunications satellites\u2014the last three countries procure\nthe services from a commercial operator. The military in these\ncountries also procure extensive amounts of commercial\ncommunications satellite services\u2014for the US and the UK,\nfor example, the commercial satellite to military satellite ratio\nin terms of bandwidth used by the military forces is typically\n4:1. The features of military communications satellites that\ndiffer from the commercial versions can include [19]\n\n\u2022 Encryption\n\u2022 Jam resistance (antenna nulling)\n\u2022 Resistance to atomic explosions in space\n\u2022 Rugged terminals\n\u2022 Coding schemes to allow covert operation.\n\nThe armed forces of the developed world are increasingly\noperating in far-flung parts of the globe. The distance\nbetween the deployed forces in theater and the infrastructure\nat home makes satellites essential for modern military\noperations. Satellites are also essential for communications\nwithin theater as there will often not have been time to\ndeploy a terrestrial communications network.\n\nThe nature of modern military operations demands more\nand more communications bandwidth. In recent years, the\nbandwidth requirement has risen fast because of the emer-\ngence of remotely controlled aircraft (UAVs or UASs). The\nsmallest UAVs communicate to their operators only within\nthe line of sight and thus do not require satellite links.\nHowever, the larger UAVs are the size of a small commercial\nairliner and satellite links are used to control them and to\n\nobtain the surveillance data from them\u2014for example, the US\ncontrols many of its larger UAVs in theater from Beale Air\nForce Base in California. The data sent back by these planes\nis often real-time video and thus very voluminous. Once the\ndata is received in California, it is sent via another satellite\nlink to the forces in theater that need it.\n\nIn such \u2018out of area\u2019 operations, satellites have to com-\nmunicate to both large and small antennas. The field head-\nquarters will typically have a relatively large antenna for\ncommunicating with home and will receive the large amounts\nof data that any modern organization needs for its operation.\nThe individual patrols, whether in jeeps, tanks, ships, heli-\ncopters or aircraft, will each have a satellite link varying from\na hand-held device for the soldier on foot to a steerable dish\nmounted on a vehicle. The mounting on a military vehicle\ntypically has to be ultra-rugged to withstand the high accel-\nerations (e.g. on a fast jet plane), rough treatment, dirt/sand/\nwater/salt, heat (desert) or cold (polar/mountainous).\n\nThe combination of satellite communications and satellite\nnavigation is central to avoiding \u2018Friendly Fire\u2019 (or, blue-on-\nblue) incidents. If every friendly unit is equipped with a GPS\nreceiver to provide its exact location and a communications\nsatellite terminal to send that information rapidly, covertly\nand reliably to field headquarters, a complete picture of\nfriendly forces can be kept up-to-date. This function is\nsometimes called \u2018blue force tracking\u2019 or \u2018situational\nawareness\u2019. Note that because of their high speed, aircraft\nhave a separate dedicated system called \u2018Identification Friend\nor Foe\u2019 that uses line of sight (non-satellite) radio links.\n\n1.2.4.2 Global Navigation Satellite System\nThe military in the US and Russia deployed the first two\nsatellite navigation services\u2014GPS (initially NavStar-GPS)\nand GLONASS (Russian: ??OHACC), an acronym for\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (Russian: ??o?a???a?\n?a???a??o??a? c?y????o?a? c?c?e?a, or Globalnaya nav-\nigatsionnaya sputnikovaya sistema). Their objective is to\nprovide real-time positioning information to personnel,\nequipment and weapons (missiles, bombs, artillery/mortar\nshells, etc.) worldwide. These systems are designed to\nenable the recipient of the GPS or GLONASS signals to\nestablish their position without needing to transmit and\nthereby reveal their position to an adversary.\n\nAs discussed in Sect. 1.2.2 the GPS (and to a much lesser\nextent GLONASS) signals are the basis for a wide and\ngrowing community of civilian users. GPS transmits signals\n(the P-code) that can only be received by users who have\nspecially equipped receivers\u2014encryption techniques are used\nto prevent unauthorized users making use of the signals. In\ncertain circumstances, over a specific region for example, the\nmilitary authorities can turn off the unencrypted signals on the\nsatellites and transmit only the military signals so that only\ntheir military will obtain positioning information.\n\n18 M. Macdonald et al.\n\n\n\nMilitary receivers for GPS differ from civilian ones by\nvirtue of the decryption facilities they contain. Receivers\nembedded in artillery shells, missiles, high-speed aircraft,\netc. will also have special features to allow them to with-\nstand the shocks and vibrations of their environment, and to\ncounteract the Doppler effect of their high speed. GLONASS\nhas similar features to GPS. Galileo will have a similar\nencrypted signal called the Public Regulated Service for\nwhich the decryption codes will be dispensed by European\ngovernment authorities.\n\n1.2.4.3 Military Surveillance Satellites: Weather\nSatellites\n\nIn some countries such as Italy the weather forecasting\nagencies are part of the military, whilst in countries such as\nthe UK the weather forecasting agencies are located else-\nwhere in government but provides a service into the mili-\ntary.3 The weather satellite activities in those countries are\ntherefore inherently both military and civilian. In other\ncountries, such as the US, the military authorities have a\nweather forecast agency in addition to, and separate from,\nthe civilian one. The US military weather agency has its own\nweather satellites called Defense Meteorological Satellite\nProgram in low-Earth orbit. A plan to merge these satellites\nwith the civilian NOAA series was canceled in 2009.\n\nThe features of military weather satellites that distinguish\nthem from civilian ones are not published. It is known that at\nleast some of their signals are encrypted to limit access to the\ndata to authorized users.\n\n1.2.4.4 Military Surveillance Satellites: Imaging\nSatellites\n\nBy 2013, eight countries acknowledged that they operated\nmilitary imaging satellites: China, France, Germany, Israel,\nItaly, Japan, Russia and the US. In addition, the UK has one\nprototype satellite in orbit (TopSat). About 20 other coun-\ntries operate surveillance satellites with sufficiently high\nresolution to be of interest to their military and which could\ntherefore be classified as dual use (civil and military)\u2014Ita-\nly\u2019s COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation is explicitly\ndual use (30 % funded by the military).\n\nSix of the eight countries mentioned above operate imag-\ning radar satellites\u2014France and Russia are the exceptions.\nFrance has an agreement with Germany and Italy to access\ntheir imaging radar satellites, while Russia has plans to deploy\ntwo imaging radar satellites, Kondor-E and Arcon-2.\n\nSix of the eight countries operate optical imaging satel-\nlites\u2014Germany and Italy are the exceptions. Thus China,\n\nIsrael, Japan and the US operate both optical and radar\nimaging systems.\n\nThe applications of these satellites are both tactical and\nstrategic. At the tactical level, they provide information in\nsupport of military operations\u2014providing maps for the\npreparation phase, detailing enemy dispositions during oper-\nations and providing feedback on results achieved after the\nevent. Imaging radar is crucial in ensuring timely imagery\nindependent of weather and time of day. Stereo optical\nimaging is offered by at least the US and French satellites, and\nis helpful in identifying objects. Multi-spectral imagery is\nprovided by most of the optical systems, which is helpful in\ndetecting subtle changes and countering camouflage.\n\nStrategic applications include cataloging the assets and\nforces of a potential adversary including facilities for pro-\nducing military equipment and weapons\u2014uranium enrich-\nment facilities are a well-publicized example of this type of\ntarget. Imaging satellites are typically in orbits about 400\u2013\n800 km altitude, but some have a significantly lower perigee\n\u2014there have been examples as low as 125 km in which case\nsignificant amounts of fuel have to be carried by the satellite\nto raise the perigee once an observing campaign has been\ncompleted. Many are in near-polar orbits to provide global\ncoverage.\n\nMilitary users want both wide area coverage and very\nhigh resolution. This incompatible combination is usually\nachieved by having two imaging systems (telescope/camera)\non-board, although the US and Russia have sometimes\nplaced these systems on separate satellites so that their\nmissions can be undertaken independently.\n\nThe US and Russia have satellites in geostationary or\nanother high altitude orbit to relay data from the imaging\nsatellites back to base. Without such a relay facility, users\nmight have to wait an hour or more until the imaging satellite\npassed over a friendly ground receiving station. China has\nlaunched a prototype version of a similar system [20].\n\n1.2.4.5 Military Surveillance Satellites: Electronic\nSurveillance\n\nThe US, Russia and recently China operate fleets of satellites\nin orbits of about 1,000 km altitude that detect transmissions\nfrom below. These are especially valuable in monitoring the\nlocation of shipping since a ship in the middle of the ocean\nstands out strongly against the radio-quiet background.\nSome Russian satellites not only listen for signals but also\nuse radar to seek ships and perhaps submarines. Many of\nthese systems comprise two or three satellites (sometimes a\n\u2018mother\u2019 ship and one or more sub-satellites) separated by\nsome tens of kilometers allowing the position of the objects\nbelow to be triangulated.\n\nThe US also operates a fleet of satellites in geostationary\nand other high altitude orbits that monitor radio communi-\ncations and radar signals. Very little is known outside\n\n3 Within the UK the weather forecasting agency, the Met Office, was\nan executive agency of the Ministry of Defence until July 2011 when it\ntransferred into the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.\n\n1 Introduction 19\n\n\n\nauthorized circles about these systems. A satellite believed to\nbe of this type was launched in November 2010 and stated\nby the head of the US National Reconnaissance Office to be\n\u201cthe largest satellite in the world\u201d [21]. This was taken by\ncommentators to be a reference to a satellite that deploys a\nvery large antenna once in orbit\u2014thought to be five or more\ntimes the roughly 18 m diameter of the largest civilian\nantennas in orbit. The large antenna is thought to allow the\nsatellites to receive from the Earth\u2019s surface 36,000 km\nbelow the very weak signals emitted upwards by mobile\nphones and towers, terrestrial microwave towers, military\nradio telephones, telemetry from missiles and aircraft, et\ncetera [22].\n\n1.2.4.6 Missile Defense\nThe US and Russia have satellites in geostationary and other\nhigh altitude orbits that detect the launch of missiles. France\nis experimenting with a satellite to detect missile launches\nand is known to be seeking collaborators among European\nUnion member countries. The US Defense Support Program\n(DSP) satellites scan the Earth below every ten seconds and\ndetect bright flashes. Details of the flashes are analyzed and\nthose conforming to the pattern of a missile launch are\nreported\u2014lightning flashes, forest fires, oil well explosions,\nmeteors entering the atmosphere and other forms of illumi-\nnation if detected are eliminated by analysis. The location of\nthe flash is computed with an accuracy of about 15 km. By\ndetecting a missile at various points in its trajectory, the\nlocation of its launch site can be estimated.\n\nIn May 2011, the first of a new series of US satellites\ncalled Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) was launched\nto geostationary orbit. However, two SBIRS sensors had\nalready been launched by this point, hosted on two classified\nsatellites in highly elliptical orbits. SBIRS is divided into\nSBIRS High, consisting of the two hosted sensors plus four\ngeostationary spacecraft, and SBIRS Low, or Space Track-\ning and Surveillance System. SBIRS Low was originally\nexpected to consist of about 24 satellites in low-Earth orbit.\nHowever, as of 2010 only two technology demonstration\nsatellites had been launched. SBIRS is intended to replace\nDSP. The SBIRS satellites provide images of the scene\nbelow as well as duplicating the DSP functions. The DSP\nsatellites provided information after the fact and were not\nintended to be part of a missile defense system, as is the case\nfor SBIRS. The key additional feature needed for missile\ndefense would be rapid dissemination of the detection of a\nmissile launch so that countervailing actions could be\ninitiated.\n\nThe US GPS satellites carry special sensors as a sec-\nondary payload to detect the explosion of a nuclear bomb\ndesigned to detect the characteristic double-peak flash of a\nnuclear explosion [23]. Prior to GPS these sensors were\ncarried on dedicated satellites called Vela.\n\n1.2.4.7 Near Earth Objects\nSmall objects from outer space hit the Earth all the time\u2014\nshooting stars. Bigger objects do so less frequently. An\nobject measuring about 40 m across struck Siberia in 1908\nand exploded in the atmosphere causing damage roughly\nequivalent to that from the explosion of a ten-megaton\nnuclear bomb. Such objects are thought to hit Earth every\nfew centuries. More recently, the airburst of the smaller,\n17 m asteroid over Chelyabinks, Russia in February 2013\nwas equivalent to a mere 0.44 megatons; about 1.8 PJ, or\n20\u201330 times more energy than was released from the atomic\nbomb detonated at Hiroshima.\n\nNASA has been tasked by the US Congress to identify\n90 % of asteroids and comets in the inner solar system bigger\nthan 140 m by 2020. A special camera is being installed on a\nmountaintop in Hawaii to scan the sky for these faint objects.\nThe European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia satellite will also help\ncomplete the survey. As a side effect of its main mission to\nmap a billion stars in our galaxy, Gaia will identify and\nlocate thousands of asteroids and comets. NASA\u2019s Kepler\nplanet finder satellite also provided a similar serendipitous\nservice albeit without Gaia\u2019s full-sky coverage [24].\n\n1.3 Space as a Technology Incubator\n\nNew technology is continually being developed for and\ndeveloped by the aerospace industry. These two avenues\ntoward new technology development have many similarities,\nas well as many differences and are known as spin-in tech-\nnology (also known as technology infusion) and spin-off\ntechnology. Spin-in technology can be thought of as bring-\ning in a technology to solve a problem, while spin-off\ntechnology is the resulting technology developed to solve a\nproblem which can subsequently be transferred to another\narena, where the technology has use to solve new problems\nnot envisioned when it was originally developed. Both\navenues also involve innovation, and this innovation comes\nfrom a \u201cconscious, purposeful search for innovation\nopportunities\u201d [25].\n\nThe flowchart in Fig. 1.17 shows the process of technology\ninfusion, which begins with an idea and a need. These parallel\npaths may or may not occur at the same time\u2014often a tech-\nnological innovation may not have an immediate need, or may\nrely on development of another technology. An idea generator\nis the technology creator. The user is the person with the\ntechnical problem. The idea generator must recognize that\nthere are opportunities to use these ideas, while the user needs\nto translate their technical problems into requirements. While\nthe ideal timing is to have both paths converge at the same\ntime, this generally does not happen. Ideas are generated on\ntheir own schedule, and if problems are not identified, the idea\nmay languish until an application is found, or it may lazily\n\n20 M. Macdonald et al.\n\n\n\nproceed to a finished concept. Avoiding the temptation for the\nuser to reinvent the wheel can be difficult, and these users\nshould exhaustively search for existing solutions to solve their\nproblems. Once the connection is made between the idea\ngenerator and the user, the opportunity recognition and\ntechnology requirements phases are reached, and the two\npaths cross each other. This allows the space user to apply\nthese ideas to solve their problems. The user can also identify\na problem and can look for a solution from an idea generator.\nShould no ideas be found, the user can then choose to reassess\ntheir problems and move in another direction, or engage a\ntechnology developer to create a suitable technology.\n\nOnce the space user finds a promising solution, there may\nbe significant interaction between the idea generator and the\nspace user. Once the space user has determined that the idea\ngenerator can develop a solution to the technical problems,\nthe idea generator (or someone else working in conjunction\nwith the idea generator), with guidance from the space user,\nworks with domain experts to apply their idea to the problem\nat hand. Upon completion of the idea development (which\nmay be in the form of hardware, software or simply an\nanalysis), the newly created technology is applied to solve a\nproblem that was not envisioned when the idea was first\ncreated. The desired outcome of this process is to solve a\ntechnical problem; there may be a bonus outcome from the\ncreation of a commercial product. The commercial product\nmay or may not be for problems in the same industry\u2014they\nmay be for problems in a completely different field. Com-\nputers are an example technology where the concepts of\nmicroprocessors were developed independently from space\napplications, but later became an important technology\ninfusion into space technology projects.\n\nThe second avenue is spin-off technology. The process is\nshown in the flowchart in Fig. 1.18. There are a significant\nnumber of similarities between the spin-off and spin-in\nprocess. Both are used as methods to support the solution of\na problem. Where spin-off differs from spin-in is in the\nmotivation for the process. As part of larger technology\ndevelopment programs, spin-offs generally occur following\nthe development of a new technology that solves a problem.\n\nThe process begins with the identification of problems in the\ncourse of developing a larger project. The project determines\nif there are available solutions that can be spun-into the\nproject. Should none be found, a technology development\nprocess is initiated and the problem is (hopefully) solved. In\nthe course of solving the technical problems, the outcome of\nthe solutions could potentially result in a commercial product.\nAn excellent example of a spin-off technology was the\nARPANet computer network development for the US\nDepartment of Defense in the late 1960s. This network was\noriginally developed for military computers to communicate\nwith each other, and it ultimately grew into arguably one of\nthe most successful commercial products from a spin-off\ntechnology in history\u2014the Internet.\n\n1.3.1 Technical Incubators\nand Commercialization\nof Space Technology\n\nMany technology endeavors get their commercialization\nstart as part of a technology incubator. The prime mission of\ntechnology incubators is to provide services to entrepreneurs\nwho are interested in commercializing an idea [26]. They\nprovide the entrepreneur with business support, marketing\nassistance, financial management, networking to strategic\npartners and investors, technology and intellectual property\nmanagement. The flow of innovation to product is shown in\nFig. 1.19. As universities tend to be a major source of\ntechnical innovation, many of these technical incubators are\nlocated at or near large research universities, and were cre-\nated by the university. Other origins of technical incubators\ncome from government agencies that are trying to attract\nhigh technology industry to the locale. These incubators\nhave been working since the 1970s to lessen the burden of\nmanaging innovation from the entrepreneur and moving that\ninto a management infrastructure that allows the entrepre-\nneur to capitalize on the technology they are commercial-\nizing, and ultimately get it into a product. Fees for such\nincubators range from fee-for-service to financial stakes in\nthe commercialized technology.\n\nVirtually every high technology industry continues to\nbenefit from technology incubators.

A\ngood example of how a technology incubator has fostered\nthe spin-in of technology began during the 1970s, when\nseveral members of the Electrical Engineering Department at\nthe University of Surrey in Surrey, UK, developed a para-\ndigm to build satellites quickly and inexpensive. They star-\nted by building small satellites with commercial off-the-shelf\ncomponents, and in 1985, the university formed Surrey\nSatellite Technology Limited (SSTL). By 2008 when the\nuniversity sold its majority stake to EADS Astrium NV, the\ncompany had grown into a 300 person company and had\ndeveloped (built or under construction) about 40 satellites.\nThis move completed the process of spinning off a new\nspace technology industry created through their technology\nincubation infrastructure.\n\n1.3.2 Spin-In Technologies\n\nNot all of the technology used in the space industry was\ndeveloped specifically for the space industry. Many\nadvanced technology developments that have been created\nfor other applications have found their way into space pro-\ngrams. Some technology development activities for other\nfields, such as microelectronics and ballistic missiles, have\nbeen readily identified as having space applications, and\nstructured pathways devised to infuse this technology into\nprograms. Other technology development programs, such as\nphotographic film, Teflon, or elastic fabric, are created\nwithout any thoughts of infusing this into the space industry,\nand some innovative group realizes how these specific\ntechnologies could solve a problem\u2014they pair a solution\nthat was developed for something else with a problem in the\nspace industry.\n\nTechnology infusion can also be stimulated by an unmet\nneed in a technology-based program. Many government-\nsupported space and military agencies provide opportunities\n\nfor private industry and academia to either develop tech-\nnology that can be infused into programs or support adapting\ntechnology for space applications. The US government, for\nexample, has several programs in various agencies and\ndepartments that foster technology development. Two\nexample organizations, NASA and the Defense Advanced\nResearch Projects Agency (DARPA) each sponsor Small\nBusiness Innovative Research (SBIR). These programs\nprovide seed money in a phase 1 program to develop new\ntechnology quickly. Promising technologies are further\ndeveloped in a phase 2 program that provides funding over a\nlonger time to mature the technology. Ultimately, the tech-\nnology is infused into the sponsoring organization\u2019s pro-\ngrams along with a parallel path towards commercialization.\nMany companies have similar programs to foster the\ndevelopment of new technologies, and generally provide\nfunding as part of a venture capital or equity sharing\narrangement. Unlike governments, whose primary motiva-\ntion is to support technology development to fulfill their\nmission, companies and investors are motivated by rapid\ncommercialization and favorable return on their investment.\n\n1.3.3 Spin-Off Technologies\n\nTechnological innovation for the space industry has become\nthe source for many every-day products used throughout the\nworld. While the motivation for the innovation behind these\nitems has been to solve immediate problems in the space\nindustry, the opportunities to spin these technologies into\ncommercial products range from being obvious, to some\nbright innovator seeing a not-so-obvious application.\n\n1.3.3.1 Sources of Spin-Off Space Technology\nSpin-off of space technology is woven into so many different\nsectors of daily lives, in both obvious and not-so-obvious\napplications. Whilst it is apparent that space technology has\ncome from many sources over the years, it is difficult to put a\n\nProduct\n\nExpand to Market\n\nLicense to\nExisting Company Small CompanyIncubator\n\nStartupPatent\n\nInnovative Research\nFig. 1.19 Strategic map:\nInnovation to product\n\n22 M. Macdonald et al.\n\n\n\nmonetary value on how much society has benefitted from\nspace technology.\n\nGovernments and industry throughout the world have\nrecognized the benefits of spin-off technology. In addition to\nthe US government\u2019s technology transfer activities in orga-\nnizations such as NASA and DARPA in the US, other\ncountries are engaging in the spin-off of their space tech-\nnology. Examples include the National Research Council\nCanada\u2019s Industrial Research Assistance Program which is\ncharged with supporting Canadian industry. The Russian\nTechnology Transfer Center coordinates technology transfer\nbetween the Russian aerospace and other high technology\ncompanies and both the Russian and international markets.\nThe European Space Agency\u2019s Technology Transfer Pro-\ngram is tasked with highlighting benefits of the European\nspace program and strengthening the competitiveness of\nEuropean industry by infusing ESA-developed technology\ninto member\u2019s industry. Many of the other space-faring\nnations have similar activities to infuse home-grown tech-\nnologies into both domestic industry and the international\nmarket.\n\n1.3.3.2 Examples of Spin-Off Space Technology\nSpin-off technology from space programs are imbedded\nthroughout modern society. These technologies have\nimproved standards of living throughout the world, and\ncontinue to do so. Various breakthroughs have improved\nlife expectancies, made instantaneous communication\nanywhere in the world possible, and have made cost-\neffective and efficient travel available to many people.\nMost people don\u2019t realize how widespread the infusion of\nspace technology into their lives is, but nearly every area\nof advanced technology has some connection with space\ntechnology.\n\nWhile there are innumerable examples of spin-off space\ntechnology, an interesting example of a spin-off that is about\nas far from the space technology field as it is possible to\nimagine is in the snack food industry. In 2009, the European\nSpace Agency\u2019s Technology Transfer Programme awarded\n\ntheir first \u2018Space Spin-Off\u2019 award for outstanding perfor-\nmance in the area of space to non-space technology transfer\nto HTG Hyperschall Technologie G\u00f6ttingen (Germany) for\napplying technology developed for soft landing a spacecraft\nto packaging potato crisps (chips).4 HTG realized that this\nsoft landing technology, developed by ESA, could be\napplied to machines that package delicate potato crisps.\nApplying this technology, their new filling machine resulted\nin increases of 30 to 50 % in speed (Fig. 1.20).\n\n1.3.4 Future Opportunities\n\nFuture opportunities to infuse technology into the space\nindustry and spin technologies out of the space industry are,\nof course, difficult to predict. Breakthroughs can happen\nwith little notice. Unexpected outcomes can spawn new\napplications, new products and even new industries. Pre-\ndicting the future is difficult, at best, and any attempt to\npredict future development from space technology will be\nfraught with errors. Predictions from the 1950s, such as\nflying cars in every garage, have shown us the limitations of\nforecasting the future. On the other hand, predictions of\npersonal communicators, seen in science fiction of the 1960s\nsuch as Star Trek, have materialized with the widespread\navailability of cell phones.\n\nRather than trying to predict the future, the more accurate\nprediction would be to make sure that the environment is\nright for spawning future technologies. The environment to\nexploit spin-in and spin-off technologies must be favorable\nfor innovators. Inventors will be more likely to develop\ninnovative technology if the pathway to commercialization\nis fairly simple through minimization of the bureaucratic\nburden and strong legal protection of the intellectual\nproperty.\n\nFig. 1.20 Landing a spacecraft\non Earth or a space probe on\nSaturn\u2019s moon Titan (as seen on\nthe left), is just like dropping a\npotato crisp into a bag.

Macdonald et al.\n\n\n\n2A System-Level View of Space Projects\nMalcolm Macdonald\n\nUntil well after World War II, with no meaningful definition\ndistinguishing the terminology, the fields of aerospace,\naeronautics and astronautics were synonymous. Indeed even\ntoday, the terms are widely misunderstood and misused.\nHowever, the great Hungarian aeronautical engineer and\nphysicist, Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n (original Hungarian name:\nSz}oll}oskislaki K\u00e1rm\u00e1n T\u00f3dor; 1881\u20131963) believed a clear\ndistinction between aeronautics and astronautics could, and\nshould be made. Therefore, in the early 1950s, and in\nconsultation with the International Federation of Astro-\nnautics (IAF), founded 1951, and the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronau-\ntique Internationale (FAI), von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n undertook the task\nof defining the respective terms.\n\nIn aeronautics, the presence of an atmosphere is critical,\nwhile in astronautics its absence is critical. As altitude is\nincreased the atmospheric density decreases. Thus, for\nsteady level flight, controlled by aerodynamic forces, the\nvelocity of the vehicle must increase until eventually the\nrequired velocity will overcome the circular orbit velocity.\nHence, aerodynamic forces are no longer required to\nmaintain steady level flight. The converse is true for astro-\nnautics. As altitude is decreased, the notion of a free-fall\norbit becomes meaningless due to the increasing atmo-\nspheric density, leading to an increase in the drag force. In\nconclusion, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n and his co-workers determined that\nthe nominal boundary could be set at an altitude of around\n100 km, a definition readily accepted by the IAF. Mean-\nwhile the FAI, who to this day administrate aeronautics\nrecords and hence had a slightly different interest in the\ndefinition, created a new category of flying machine, named\nspacecraft, which from that point on would have separate\nrecords to aircraft. Section 8 of the FAI Sporting Code\n\nwould, thereafter govern such machines, and the distinction\nbetween aeronautics and astronautics.1 The code defines the\nnominal boundary to space as the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n ellipsoid, an\nellipsoid at 100 km altitude; often termed simply as the\nK\u00e1rm\u00e1n line. A spacecraft is thus a vehicle or vessel\ndesigned to operate beyond the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n ellipsoid. By\nextension of this definition, crafts such as rovers, landers or\n(non-Earth) atmospheric probes are also termed spacecraft.\nNote that the plural of spacecraft is spacecraft.\n\nHaving established a simple and clear definition of a\nspacecraft, reality must unfortunately intervene. Within the\nspace community, the term spacecraft has two contradictory\nmeanings in common parlance. The first refers to the\nspacecraft as the whole vehicle, while the other refers only\nto the platform onto which the payload is mounted. For this\nreason, the term satellite is often used, a term which simply\nmeans a body orbiting another of larger size. However, not\nall spacecraft orbit and hence the terms space probe or space\nvehicle can be used when satellite is inappropriate, such as a\nMars lander. Within this book, all of these terms are used\nin-line with in common parlance (Fig. 2.1).\n\nJust as the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n ellipsoid is not actually a hard\nand clear boundary between aircraft and spacecraft, space\ntechnology cannot be considered solely as the space vehicle,\nrather the vehicle is part of a much larger system. A space\nsystem can be considered the entirety of hardware, software\nand human resources required to conduct a space mission.\nThe space system is typically subdivided into the space\nsegment and the ground segment.\n\nThe space segment is the spacecraft, while the ground\nsegment is the system on Earth that manages and controls\nthe spacecraft, and its data products. The ground segment\ncan be subdivided into two core components; the flight\noperations segment, relating to the spacecraft housekeeping,\n\nM. Macdonald (&)\nAdvanced Space Concepts Laboratory, Strathclyde Space\nInstitute, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, Scotland\ne-mail: malcolm.macdonald.102@strath.ac.uk\n\n1 See www.fai.org.\n\nM.

Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014\n\n25\n\nhttp://www.fai.org\n\n\nor telemetry data, and commanding, and the payload data\nground segment, relating to the spacecraft data product. The\nflight operations segment will typically be managed by a\nsingle control center. However, this center may itself be\nsupported by other secondary centers. The spacecraft con-\ntrol center is ultimately responsible for the safe operations\nof the spacecraft. Moreover, under nominal operations it\nwill be the sole originator of all spacecraft commands.\n\nThe spacecraft\u2019s data product can be disseminated in\nmany ways, typically defined by the spacecraft mission, as\nshown in Fig. 2.2. It should also be noted that the overall\narchitecture need not include a direct-link from spacecraft\nto ground, but can use an inter-spacecraft link, as also\nshown in Fig. 2.2.\n\nThe final component of the space system is the launch\nvehicle, which has the primary objective of traversing the\nvon K\u00e1rm\u00e1n ellipsoid to deliver a payload, i.e. a space\nvehicle, into space. The launch vehicle need not specifically\nestablish its payload in an Earth orbit, rather it can enter a\nsuborbital, or parabolic arc, it can place the payload directly\nonto an Earth escape trajectory, perhaps en route to another\nplanet, or it can place it into an Earth orbit. The final orbit of\na spacecraft is often actually achieved through a combina-\ntion of the launch vehicle and the spacecraft\u2019s own pro-\npulsive capabilities. For example, a geostationary\ncommunications spacecraft is typically inserted by the\nlaunch vehicle into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO)\nwith apogee at geostationary distance, see Chap. 4, and\nperigee at only a few hundred kilometers altitude. The\ncommunications spacecraft will thereafter use its own pro-\npulsive capabilities to maneuver into a geostationary orbit\n(GEO). Thus, the functional boundary between the final\nstage of the multi-stage launch vehicle and the propulsive\ncapabilities of the launch vehicles payload is somewhat\nambiguous. As such, within this handbook space\n\ntransportation systems are considered simply as a different\ntype of spacecraft mission objective or phase.\n\n2.1 The Space Segment\n\nThe space segment is defined as everything beyond the von\nK\u00e1rm\u00e1n ellipsoid. As shown in Fig. 2.2 the space segment\narchitecture can take different forms, perhaps with space-\ncraft providing services to other spacecraft in a manner\nwhich may, or may not, have been envisaged when either\nspacecraft was commissioned. Most typically, such services\ninclude communications or navigation assistance.\n\nThe space segment can also be constructed of several\nspacecraft working in isolation, and largely operated as\nindividuals, to provide a coherent ground-segment data\nproduct; this is termed a spacecraft constellation. Several\nspacecraft constellations are in service today. Perhaps the\nmost widely known of these is the global navigation satel-\nlite system (GNSS) maintained by the United States gov-\nernment, under the stewardship of the Department of\nDefense, as a national resource, called the Global Posi-\ntioning System (GPS). Historically, the other principal\nGNSS system was the Russian GLObal Navigation Satellite\nSystem (GLONASS), which was used solely by the Russian\nmilitary until 2007, when it was made available to civilians.\nHowever, as discussed in Chap. 1 several other nations are\nnow keenly pursuing this technology, including the Chinese\nBeiDou-2 navigation system and the European Union\u2019s\nGalileo positioning system. It is of note that many space-\ncraft today use GPS to aid in-orbit navigation. Another\nspacecraft constellation of note is the Iridium constellation,\nowned and operated by Iridium Communications Inc.,\nconsisting of over 60 spacecraft providing voice and data\ncoverage to satellite phones, pagers and integrated trans-\nceivers over Earth\u2019s entire surface. A key feature of the\nIridium constellation, and all other space-backbone mobile\nphone systems, is the ability to operate in areas of limited\ninfrastructure, making them of significant value not only to\nthe military, but also in disaster relief efforts where the\ninfrastructure has been destroyed (Fig. 2.3).\n\nAlternatively, spacecraft can work co-operatively to form\na single integrated space segment, this is termed formation\nflying and quite a few natural formations are possible, see\nChap. 4. Indeed, several spacecraft are claimed to have\nflown in formation, for example, ESA have previously flown\nthe ERS-2, European Remote-Sensing Satellite-2, spacecraft\nand ENVISAT, Environmental Satellite, in a tandem for-\nmation enabling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interfer-\nometry, or InSAR measurements to be made. InSAR\ncombines two or more SAR images of the same site to allow\nslight variations that may have occurred between image\nacquisitions to be detected. As shown in Fig. 2.4, the\n\nFig. 2.1 Image of the upper regions of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, from\napproximately 28 km altitude, leading to space and including the\nregion of the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n ellipsoid. Image University of Strathclyde\n\n26 M. Macdonald\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_1\n\n\nERS-ENVISAT tandem formation was configured such that\nSAR images of the same site would be acquired 28 min\napart, enabling rapid variations to be detected. Figure 2.4\nshows a sea ice displacement map acquired by the\nERS-ENVISAT tandem formation where sea ice displace-\nments of over 150 m were detected in less than half an hour.\nIt should be noted however that the ERS-ENVISAT tandem\nformation is really closer to a two spacecraft constellation\nthan a formation. Formation flying is perhaps best illustrated\nby mission concepts where the spacecraft are required to act\nin a coordinated manner in order to provide the required data\nproduct. Examples of this are the joint ESA/NASA Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA), mission concept, or\nESA\u2019s free-flying X-ray observatory mission concept, Xeus,\nwhere the mirror and detectors would be located on separate\nspacecraft, flying in formation 50 m apart.\n\n2.1.1 Payload\n\nFor space science missions the payload is typically a\nbespoke suite of instruments. Meanwhile for commercial\nspacecraft, such as communications platforms the payload,\n\nand its supporting platform, will typically have some sig-\nnificant flight heritage and may be produced many tens of\ntimes. However, it is easily forgotten by the spacecraft\nengineer that the payload is the raison d\u2019\u00eatre of any\nspacecraft. Indeed, the Merriam Webster Dictionary gives a\nparticularly adept definition of payload as \u2018\u2018the load carried\nby a vehicle exclusive of what is necessary for its operation;\nespecially: the load carried by an aircraft or spacecraft\nconsisting of things (as passengers or instruments) neces-\nsary to the purpose of the flight.\u2019\u2019 In other words, the pay-\nload is the biological passengers, or the part of a robotic\nvehicle that produces revenue, a product or a service. The\nprincipal purpose of the rest of the spacecraft is thus to\nserve the needs of the payload, positioning it where it needs\nto be in space, while providing it with power, communi-\ncations and the desired thermal environment, whilst also\nensuring it is pointing in the correct direction on a suffi-\nciently stable platform.\n\nIt should be noted that the term payload is often used at\nvarious levels of the space system to denote different things;\ntypically, this can be understood by considering the purpose\nof the vehicle. For example, the launch vehicle payload is\nthe spacecraft, while the spacecraft may have a payload that\n\nFig. 2.2 The generic space\nsystem (not to scale); comprising\nthe space segment and the ground\nsegment.

Image\nIridium Communications Inc\n\n2 A System-Level View of Space Projects 27\n\n\n\nis a communications system, science instruments, or, say, a\nlander. The lander then may have a science suite on board,\nbut it may also carry a payload of a rover, and the rover may\nin turn have a science suite payload.\n\n2.2 The Ground Segment\n\nThe ground segment is defined as everything before the von\nK\u00e1rm\u00e1n ellipsoid and consists of the entirety of hardware,\nsoftware and human resources required to manage and\n\ncontrol a space vehicle. As discussed above, the ground\nsegment can be subdivided into two core components, the\nflight operations segment and the payload data ground\nsegment. The flight operations segment is relatively inde-\npendent of the spacecraft mission, and is focused on\nthe command and control of the spacecraft. However, the\npayload data ground segment is heavily defined by the\nmission objectives and the data product. For example, in a\nscience mission the primary spacecraft control center will\ntypically receive the flight operations data as well as the\nscience data product. The data product will then be passed\n\nFig. 2.4 Geometry of ERS-envisat tandem operation (left) and\ngeocoded sea ice displacement map (right); the green areas correspond\nto an observed sea ice displacement of about 160 m in 28 min. The\n\nimage brightness corresponds to the backscattering of the Envisat\nimage. Image ESA\n\nFig. 2.5 The gravity field and\nsteady-state ocean circulation\nexplorer (GOCE), mission space\nsystem and data flow. Image\nESA\u2014AOES Medialab\n\n28 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\nto the payload data ground segment, which may or may not\nbe collocated. The payload data ground segment will then\npass the data product to a science principal investigator (PI)\nfor some initial high-level processing prior to the data being\ndistributed widely, typically via the Internet as shown in\nFig. 2.2. Furthermore, in a science mission the request for\nspecific data products will also be managed by the space-\ncraft control center, as shown in Fig. 2.2. The ESA Gravity\nfield and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE),\nmission space system and ground-segment data flow is\nshown in Fig. 2.5.\n\nAlternatively consider, for example, a communications\nspacecraft, where the flight operations segment will typi-\ncally not be directly concerned with the data product, as\nshown in Fig. 2.2, and may in fact be wholly separate.\nIndeed, typically commercial data products, such as Direct-\nto-Home television, or mobile phone communications, are\ndepended on this type of space system and ground segment\narchitecture.\n\n2.2.1 Ground Stations\n\nTo provide high quality, reliable and robust communica-\ntions with spacecraft it is typical to use multiple ground\nstations, often positioned at geographically strategic loca-\ntions. For low inclination spacecraft, the ground stations\nwill ideally be distributed in longitude to ensure at least one\ncommunications window per revolution. While for polar\norbiting spacecraft, ground stations close to the poles will\nprovide one communications window per revolution.\n\nTwo well-known examples of ground station networks\nare ESA\u2019s tracking station network (ESTRACK), a world-\nwide system of ground stations providing links between\nspacecraft and ESA\u2019s Operations Control Centre at ESOC,\nand, the NASA-JPL operated Deep Space Network (DSN),\nwhich supports both Earth orbiting spacecraft and inter-\nplanetary missions. Note that the DSN is separate from\nNASA\u2019s Near Earth Network (NEN), which provides\norbital communications support for Earth orbiting platforms\nvia various NASA ground stations and is operated out of the\nGoddard Space Flight Center. The ESTRACK network is\nshown in Fig. 2.6.\n\nIt is perhaps a sign of the maturity of robotic space\ntechnology that the traditional divide between ground and\nspace segment is, perhaps most notably disappearing when\ndiscussing ground station system architectures. An exam-\nple of this is NASA\u2019s Space Network (SN) project\nestablished in the early 1980s to replace NASAs world-\nwide network of ground tracking stations. SN provides\ncommunications support to Earth orbiting spacecraft, such\nas the International Space Station, using both a traditional\nground segment and a space segment, through geosta-\ntionary Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS). SN\ncan provide tracking and data acquisition services over\n100 % of a spacecraft\u2019s orbit for altitudes between 73 and\n3,000 km. The SN architecture is shown in Fig. 2.7, where\nit is seen that the traditional ground-segment is, in effect,\nbeing extended into the space segment. Note the proposed\nEuropean Data Relay Satellite (EDRS) system, also men-\ntioned in Chap. 1, is a further example of this type of\nextension.\n\nFig. 2.6 The ESA tracking\nnetwork in january 2011. Image\nESA\n\n2 A System-Level View of Space Projects 29\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_1\n\n\n2.2.2 Operations\n\nThe operation of a spacecraft is often the only part of the\nspace system which directly involves humans, other than of\ncourse human space flight. The operations team is the\nfundamental human element, integrating the system and the\nmission. Success will often depend on the quality of this\nteam. As such, the operations team will develop carefully\nconsidered and detailed operations procedures, documents\nand manuals, and will train ahead of launch using an\noperations simulator. The operations simulator will also be\nused in-flight to check spacecraft commands prior to actu-\nally sending them to the spacecraft. The operations team of\nthe Mercury Sigma-7 spacecraft is seen in Fig. 2.8, training\nin the control room prior to launch. Meanwhile, the oper-\nations team of CryoSat-2 is similarly seen in training almost\n50 years later in the same figure. It should also be noted that\nthe operations team extends significantly beyond the control\nroom, to include support and specialist engineers, scientists\nand technologists, hardware and software support as well as\ngeneral project, site and administrative support.\n\n2.2.3 Two-Line Elements\n\nA key objective of the ground segment is to determine the\norbital ephemeris of the spacecraft. The Keplerian orbital\nparameters, see Chap. 4, can be encoded in a number of\nformats, but the most commonly used is the NORAD (North\nAmerican Aerospace Defense Command) \u2018Two-Line Ele-\nment\u2019, TLE, format due to its concise nature. The orbital\nephemeris of many thousands of space objects, including\nboth active spacecraft and orbital debris, is determined by\nNORAD, and freely distributed via the Internet in the form\n\nof TLEs.2 Two-Line Elements can easily be automatically\nretrieved for use in spacecraft trajectory simulation soft-\nware. A sample TLE is shown in Table 2.1, where it is seen\nthat the TLE consists of a title, followed by two lines of\nformatted text. From Table 2.1 it is seen that the Interna-\ntional Space Station is in an orbit inclined 51.6? to the\nequator, completing 15.7 revolutions per day in a virtually\ncircular path. Note that the BSTAR term in column 54 of\nline one of the TLE is an adjusted value of the ballistic\ncoefficient, see Chap. 4, where the ballistic coefficient is\nmultiplied by half of a reference value of atmospheric\ndensity.\n\n2.3 Space Project Planning,\nImplementation and Technology\n\nThe space project begins with a set of top-level objectives,\nfor example, the GOCE mission, launched in March 2009,\nhad the objective to measure the Earth\u2019s gravity field, and\nmodel the geoid with an unprecedented accuracy and spatial\nresolution. The mission analysis and design process then\ndefines the space system, considering system and technol-\nogy constraints, to define measurable mission objectives\nand metrics that can be achieved within the ultimate mission\nconstraint of cost.\n\nSeveral tools, methodologies and standards are available\nto the space system engineer to facilitate the process of\nmission analysis, design and technology assessment. Some\nof these are introduced here.\n\nFig. 2.7 Space network\ncustomer and operations\ninterface. Image Malcolm\nMacdonald\n\n2 See http://celestrak.com/.\n\n30 M.

Despite being intended as a European initiative,\nECSS has gained a global importance and provides an\nexcellent resource for the development of good practice.\nThe ECSS standards are typically mandated for use in ESA\nmissions and users are encouraged to provide feedback on\nusage to ensure the standards remain \u2018live\u2019 documents.\n\nThe ECSS documentation architecture contains three\nbranches, these are \u2018Management\u2019, \u2018Product Assurance\u2019 and\n\n\u2018Engineering\u2019, each of which contains a subset of standard\ndocuments split into four hierarchical levels, defined to the\ndetail level of detail required to differentiate major func-\ntions, disciplines and activities.

In\naddition, it defines the constraints and requirements for\ninterfaces, and the performance of the specified product or\nactivity. The Level 3 documents are guidelines and are\nallowed to be adapted to the needs of a project.\n\n2.3.2 Project Phasing\n\nThe ECSS divides the space mission project life cycle into\nseven phases; these are defined in Table 2.2 alongside the\nequivalent six NASA phase definitions. It should be noted\n\nthat other established space institutions, such as the US\nDepartment of Defense, often use their own project life\ncycle phasing.\n\nEach project phase is associated with certain activities and\nproject milestones, typically in the form of project reviews,\nwhich will also likely be payment milestones. The basic\nactivities during each mission phase are illustrated in\nFig. 2.9, where the ECSS-defined milestones are given\nalongside additional NASA-defined milestones. Note from\nFig. 2.9 that on occasion the same review will be given a\ndifferent name by ECSS and NASA. A detailed description of\neach mission phase can be found in the ECSS documentation;\n\nTable 2.1 The TLE of the International Space Station on April 4 (day 94), 2011\n\nInternational Space Station Two-Line Element\n\nISS (ZARYA)\n\n1 25544U 98067A 11094.38711506 .00060886 00000-0 44580-3 0 1260\n\n2 25544 51.6466 179.6373 0002360 82.3471 6.0048 15.72587753709286\n\nColumn Characters Description Example\n\nTitle Line\n\n1 24 Satellite Name ISS (ZARYA)\n\nLINE 1\n\n1 1 Line No. Identification 1\n\n3 5 Catalog No. 25544\n\n8 1 Security Classification U\n\n10 2 International Identification (last two digits of launch year) 98\n\n12 3 International Identification (launch number of year) 067\n\n15 3 International Identification (piece of launch) A\n\n19 2 Epoch year (last two digits of) 11\n\n21 12 Epoch day (day of year and fraction of day) 094.38711506\n\n34 10 First time derivative of mean motion, divided by two .00060886\n\n45 8 Second time derivative of mean motion divided by six, decimal\npoint assumed\n\n00000-0\n\n54 8 BSTAR drag term, decimal point assumed 44580-3\n\n63 1 \u2018Ephemeris type\u2019, now just the number 0 0\n\n65 4 Element number 126\n\n69 1 Checksum (modulo 10) 0\n\nLINE 2\n\n1 1 Line No. Identification 2\n\n3 5 Catalog No. 25544\n\n9 8 Inclination 51.6466\n\n18 8 Right Ascension of Ascending Node 179.6373\n\n27 7 Eccentricity with assumed leading decimal 0002360\n\n35 8 Argument of the Perigee 82.3471\n\n44 8 Mean Anomaly 6.0048\n\n53 11 Revolutions per Day (Mean Motion) 15.72587753\n\n64 5 Revolution Number at Epoch 70928\n\n69 1 Check Sum Modulo 10 6\n\n32 M.

Sustaining engineering support in place.\n\nUnderstanding the TRL of a technology is critical to\nunderstanding the risk associated with that technology and,\nas such, an accurate assessment of a technology\u2019s TRL is a\ncritical part of the mission analysis and design process. The\napplication of TRLs to technology management will be\ndiscussed in Chap. 21.\n\n2.3.4 AD2: Advancement Degree of Difficulty\n\nIt was recognized within NASA when the TRL granularity\nwas expanded from seven to nine levels in the mid-1990s\nthat TRLs give an incomplete understanding of the techni-\ncal concept, capability or product being assessed. As such in\n1998 John Mankins, who had developed the increased TRL\ngranularity proposed a \u2018Research and Development Degree\nof Difficulty\u2019, R&D3, system as \u2018\u2018a measure of how much\ndifficulty is expected to be encountered in the maturation of\na particular technology\u2019\u2019 [1]. Within the R&D3 system five\nlevels of difficulty were defined, giving the probability of\nsuccess with \u2018normal\u2019 levels of research and development\neffort as between 20 and 99 %. Although the TRL concept\nis today widely used, the R&D3 system was never widely\nadopted or used.\n\nUsing the core principles of the R&D3 system, the\n\u2018Advancement Degree of Difficulty\u2019 (AD2), system was\nproposed in 2002 [2], focusing on the issues with the\ndevelopment and incorporation of new technologies into a\nspace systems. As a result, the AD2 system provides nine\nlevels of risk, from 0 to 100 %, associated with the\nadvancement of a technology from one TRL to the next, as\nshown in Fig. 2.11. Only by combining TRL and AD2, or\nsome similar assessment, can a complete understanding be\ngained of the maturity and applicability of a technical\nconcept, capability or product.\n\n34 M. Macdonald\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_21\n\n\nThe AD2 can be defined further as\nLevel 1. Exists with no or only minor modifications being\n\nrequired. A single development approach is\nadequate.\n\nLevel 2. Exists but requires major modifications. A single\ndevelopment approach is adequate.\n\nLevel 3. Requires new development well within the expe-\nrience base. A single development approach is\nadequate.\n\nLevel 4. Requires new development but similarity to\nexisting experience is sufficient to warrant com-\nparison across the board. A single development\napproach can be taken with a high degree of\nconfidence for success.\n\nLevel 5. Requires new development but similarity to\nexisting experience is sufficient to warrant com-\nparison in all critical areas. Dual development\napproaches should be pursued to provide a high\ndegree of confidence for success.\n\nLevel 6. Requires new development but similarity to\nexisting experience is sufficient to warrant com-\nparison on only a subset of critical areas. Dual\ndevelopment approaches should be pursued in\norder to achieve a moderate degree of confidence\nfor success. Desired performance can be\nachieved in subsequent block upgrades with a\nhigh degree of confidence.\n\nLevel 7. Requires new development but similarity to\nexisting experience is sufficient to warrant com-\nparison in only a subset of critical areas. Multiple\ndevelopment routes must be pursued.\n\nLevel 8. Requires new development where similarity to\nexisting experience base can be defined only in\nthe broadest sense. Multiple development routes\nmust be pursued.\n\nLevel 9. Requires new development outside of any existing\nexperience base. No viable approaches exist that\ncan be pursued with any degree of confidence.\nBasic research in key areas needed before feasible\napproaches can be defined.\n\n2.3.5 ITAR: International Traffic in Arms\nRegulations\n\nA further issue to consider in the availability of technology,\nespecially for technologists outside the USA is the impact\nof the 1976 Arms Export Control Act of the US govern-\nment, which gives the President of the United States the\nauthority to control the import and export of defense articles\nand services. The provisions of this act are implemented\nwithin International Traffic in Arms Regulations, often\ntermed simply ITAR. ITAR dictates that items on the\nUnited States Munitions List (USML) are export-restricted\nitems. USML items are subject to change and re-interpre-\ntation. For example, following the February 1996 launch\nfailure of the Long March-3B carrying Intelsat-708, which\ncontained sophisticated communications and encryption\ntechnology, several parts of the spacecraft debris were never\nrecovered by the satellite\u2019s American developers. This led\nto the suggestion that debris may have been recovered by\nthe government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, with\n\nFig. 2.11 Advancement degree\nof difficulty (AD2), levels of risk.\nImage Malcolm Macdonald\n\n2 A System-Level View of Space Projects 35\n\n\n\nIntelsat and the Clinton administration suffering domestic\ncriticism for possibly allowing technology transfer to China.\nFollowing an investigation by the US Congress, in 2002 the\nUnited States Department of State charged Hughes Elec-\ntronics and Boeing Satellite Systems with export control\nviolations in relation to the failed launch of Intelsat-708 and\nthe prior failed launch of the APSTAR-II satellite. As a\nresult, space technology become subject to scrutiny within\nthe ITAR framework.\n\nThe goal of ITAR is to limit arms proliferation, safe-\nguard the national security of the US and further its gov-\nernment\u2019s foreign policy objectives. However, the selection\nof USML items can have significant adverse programmatic\neffects for space programs outside the USA, limiting, for\nexample, launch vehicle options or even the end-customers\naccess to the purchased system. As such, \u2018ITAR-free\u2019\ncomponents, sub-systems or even platforms are a major\nselling point for commercial components, sub-systems,\nsystems and platforms in Europe and beyond.\n\nThe impact of ITAR was a reduction of the US share of the\ncommercial spacecraft production market from 83 % in\n1999, when the State Department took over the export reg-\nulation of spacecraft, to 50 % in 2008 [3]; moreover,\n\nEuropean manufacturers wherever possible avoid the use of\nITAR (and hence US) components. In 2010, the US Congress\nrequested an assessment of the risks of removing spacecraft\nand their components from the USML. The study, known as\nthe 1,248 report, was completed in April 2012. In late 2012,\nthe US Congress passed the fiscal 2013 defense authorization\nbill, which allows the president to remove commercial\nspacecraft and there components from the USML. It also\nallows him to decide which satellite technologies are the\nmost important to protect while continuing to restricts export\nto China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. The\nimpact of this change, along with the effectiveness of its\nimplementation, will take a number of years to assess.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Macdonald\n\n\n\n3Space Environments and Survivability\nHenry B. Garrett\n\nJust as spacecraft design teams are increasingly approaching\nthe design and construction of a spacecraft as an integrated\nsystem, the overall environment and survivability of the\nspacecraft should be approached in a similar fashion. Typi-\ncally perceived as either too expensive or design limiting,\ndesign for environmental survivability, whether it be from\nthermal, radiation, atomic oxygen, or spacecraft charging\neffects, is usually done strictly on an ad hoc basis. Unfortu-\nnately, \u2018faster, better, cheaper\u2019 (FBC) missions seldom con-\nsider anything much beyond thermal effects and,\nindependently, radiation effects on selected parts. The basic\nrequirements however, to significantly reduce the weight/size\nof a FBC mission and to make use of the latest commercial,\noff-the-shelf devices [with their often significantly lower\nradiation and Single Event Effects (SEE) tolerances] mandate\nthat much greater thought be given to multiple uses of the\nspacecraft design to fulfill multiple environmental surviv-\nability functions. The objective of this chapter, after provid-\ning an introduction and overview of the space environment\nand its effects, is to detail the steps required for a systematic\napproach to space environment survivability that can be\nachieved with the least impact on the overall design process.\n\nFortunately, the concepts required to carry out a systems\napproach to environmental survivability currently exist. For\nexample, both the Galileo Jupiter and the Cassini Saturn\nmissions expended considerable effort in developing the\nmethods necessary to design a thermal protection system that\nboth provided meteoroid protection and limited spacecraft\ncharging effects. In the case of Galileo, extensive effort was\nspent in developing an integrated radiation-resistance design\nfor the Star Scanner\u2014the designers picked a radiation resis-\ntant photomultiplier, substituted mirrors for lenses where\n\npossible, and carefully placed additional shielding to provide\nrobust protection (upwards of 10 g/cm2), to maximize the\nsurvivability of this system during Galileo\u2019s passage through\nJupiter\u2019s inner radiation belts. Spot shielding, Error Detection\nand Correction (EDAC) software, hardening of selected\ncomponents, Faraday cage shielding of the cabling, and\nsimilar techniques were all combined to provide ultra-reliable\nprotection for the Galileo and Cassini systems. In the case of\nCassini, attention was also paid to the way the vehicle was\noriented in flight so as to limit meteoroid impacts. To a\ndegree, radiation fluxes are also \u2018oriented\u2019\u2014a factor that can\nbe used to limit impacts on sensitive surfaces. On a case-by-\ncase basis, good tools exist for providing specific types of\nenvironmental protection and that, in some instances, allow\ncombining techniques. A well thought out survivable design\nconsiders all these components simultaneously.\n\nThe next generation of \u2018microsats\u2019, \u2018cubesats\u2019, or\n\u2018sciencecraft\u2019 will implicitly require a systematic approach\nto environmental protection if they are to realize meaningful\nlevels of reliability within the size, mass, and power con-\nstraints of these concepts. The placement of parts, the\nselection of environmentally robust software (i.e., EDAC for\nSEEs), intelligent \u2018on\u2013off\u2019 control of sensitive systems when\nthe spacecraft is in a hazardous environment (many com-\nponents are \u2018harder\u2019 when turned off), use of intrinsically\nhard circuit designs as opposed to softer circuit designs,\nredundancy, utilization of graceful degradation, multiple use\nof shielding (for thermal, radiation, spacecraft charging,\natomic oxygen protection, etc.) are a few of the procedures\nto be considered. One example brings the point home: on the\nUS Department of Defense Clementine spacecraft, officially\ncalled the Deep Space Program Science Experiment\n(DSPSE), the average shielding was *100 mils (*2.5 mm)\nof aluminum. This implied that the solid-state recorder\nwould be sensitive to approximately 1,000 Single Event\nUpsets (SEU) per day background due to protons. Indeed\nClementine experienced an observable solar proton event\n\nH. B.

The Clementine solid-\nstate recorder, however, did not see the event and averaged\naround only 70 SEUs per day over the mission. A careful\nreview of the spacecraft design revealed that the majority of\nthe solid-state recorder components were protected by at\nleast 300 mils (7.6 mm) of shielding\u2014not from the space-\ncraft but because the boards were closely packed inside their\nboxes and provided a significant amount of self-shielding.\nDesigners, particularly in the early stages of a mission often\nfail to take account of such \u2018intrinsic shielding\u2019, leading to\nan erroneous concern for radiation effects.\n\nA proper systematic design approach to environmental\nsurvivability requires: (1) a review of the primary environ-\nments and interaction(s) of concern and (2) a listing of the\ngeneral design options for each concern. These options\nshould be cross-correlated with the specific interactions to\nidentify design options common to the different effects. The\ndesign is then iterated with changes in the design reflected in\nquantifiable metrics for each effect\u2014for example, changing\na thermal blanket design may change the meteoroid pro-\ntection and may alter the radiation shielding and spacecraft\nmass. Changing the position of a star scanner might enhance\nits radiation protection or alter its thermal load. A systematic\ndesign approach needs to identify such \u2018cross-correlations\u2019.\nUltimately, the goal of an analysis is to identify the mini-\nmum number of design procedures that can yield the max-\nimum benefit for several different environmental effects.\n\nThe steps taken to limit a particular environment and its\neffects are typically well understood\u2014Galileo is an exam-\nple of how different protection methods can be played off\nagainst multiple effects. It is also clear that if mass and size\nare a premium and if environmentally \u2018soft\u2019 and advanced\ntechnology are synonymous, then the integrated approach is\nboth necessary and a prerequisite if missions are to succeed\nin the future. Guidelines and methods for approaching the\nproblem systematically are reviewed in this chapter. The\nobjective is to provide an insight into initial integrated\nenvironmental survivability design and for establishing the\nreality of the potential benefits.\n\n3.1 Procedure\n\nThe steps for identifying various integrated design trade-\noffs starts with the definition of the mission: its trajectory,\ninstruments, and requirements. From these the relevant\nenvironments and interactions are defined. Based on the\ntop-level interaction(s), the design trade-offs or options are\nthen identified. These are then assessed in terms of relevant\nselection criteria (say, mass, cost, complexity, software\nimpact, and so forth). The design trade space is optimized\nand a set of design solutions developed for project consid-\neration. These steps are listed in Table 3.1.\n\n3.2 Environments\n\nThe space environment is far from benign in its effects on\nspace systems. Given the growing complexity and conse-\nquent sensitivity of space systems, an understanding of the\nspace environment and its interactions is the first step in\nmitigating these effects. Ten types of environment will be\nconsidered here. The first, the neutral atmosphere, is pri-\nmarily responsible for drag, glow, and oxygen erosion. The\nnext two environments, the magnetic and electric fields, are\nresponsible for magnetic torques and induced electric fields.\nThe UV/EUV radiation environment is not only responsible\nfor the formation of planetary ionospheres but also for\nphotoelectrons and long-term changes in material surface\nproperties. The IR environment is a major driver of thermal\neffects. Four charged-particle environments are considered:\nthe interplanetary environment, the plasmasphere/iono-\nsphere (responsible for ram/wake effects and solar array\narcing), the plasmasheet (the primary region for spacecraft\ncharging) and its low altitude extension the auroral zone,\nand the radiation belts. Although primarily referenced to the\nEarth, these environments each have their direct corollaries\nfor the other planets as well. Finally, the solid-particle\nenvironment (synthetic space debris (unique to the Earth),\ninterplanetary meteoroids, and surface dust) will be dis-\ncussed (cometary particle clouds and planetary rings must\nalso be considered). The intent is not to provide a detailed\ndescription of each environment (which are planet/orbit\nspecific) but rather to provide an overview of their chief\ncharacteristics as they apply to environmental interactions.\nThese characteristics are needed in defining the spacecraft\neffects for the purpose of design trade studies.\n\n3.2.1 Neutral Atmosphere\n\nTypically, the major environment at low altitudes around\nthe planets (except Mercury) and Titan is the ambient\nneutral atmosphere. Atmospheric drag and ablation are\n\nTable 3.1 Integrated environmental design procedure\n\nStep\nnumber\n\nStep\n\nOne Identify requirements based on trajectory, instruments,\nand unique mission constraints\n\nTwo Rate the environments versus the interactions\n\nThree Identify the design trade-offs for the environments/\ninteractions of highest concern\n\nFour Establish mass, cost, complexity criteria metrics for\ntrade-offs\n\nFive Optimize combinations of design choices\n\nSix Evaluate resulting designs\n\n38 H. B. Garrett\n\n\n\nmajor concerns for this environment. In addition, typical\norbital velocities relative to an atmosphere lead to impact\nenergies of multiple eV\u2019s\u2014high enough to induce chemical\ninteractions such as oxygen erosion. Neutral particle den-\nsities for the Earth range from 1010 cm-3 at approximately\n200 km altitude to 106 cm-3 or less at 1,000 km altitude,\nsee Fig. 3.1. Atmospheric models that describe the density,\ncomposition, and temperature fall into three basic classes:\nstatic profiles, global analytic fits, and time-dependent\nsimulations. Examples for the Earth are the US Standard\nAtmosphere profiles, the Jacchia and MSIS (mass spec-\ntrometer and incoherent scatter) analytic models, and vari-\nous thermospheric global circulation models (TGCMs) [1].\nFor the Earth at least, there are a number of models. Similar\ntypes of models exist for the other planets and some of the\nmoons. Static profiles in particular are readily available for\nmost destinations, but aside from Mars, where several MSIS\nand TGCM models exist on-line, direct access to more\ncomplicated models for the other planets is typically lim-\nited. Static models for planets such as Venus and Mars are\nuseful for reentry or atmospheric capture. The effects of the\natmosphere on a spacecraft\u2019s trajectory, along with a more\ndetailed discussion of atmospheric density models, can be\nfound in the astrodynamics chapter (Chap. 4).\n\n3.2.2 Electric and Magnetic Fields\n\nElectric and magnetic fields exist around most bodies in\nspace. Magnetic fields range from tenths of a gauss near the\nEarth and *4\u20138 gauss at Jupiter\u2019s surface down to a few\ngammas (nanotesla) in the solar wind. Note that one tesla is\nequal to 104 gauss. Ambient or induced electric fields (e.g.,\n\nV 9 B, see later) range from 0.3 V/m close to the Earth to\nas much as 60 V/m near Jupiter. For comparison, spacecraft\nsurface charging potentials can reach *20 kV at the Earth.\nThere are detailed models of the magnetic fields of Earth,\nJupiter and Saturn, from which the induced electric fields\ncan be derived [3]. Mars, the Moon and Venus do not have\nsignificant magnetic fields, although strong local magnetic\nfield anomalies have been identified at the Moon, while\nMercury\u2019s field is apparently about 1 % as strong as Earth\u2019s\nbut remains subject to further investigation by both the\nMESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment,\nGEochemistry and Ranging) and BepiColombo space mis-\nsions. There are first-order models of the magnetic fields of\nNeptune and Uranus but these will need to be better\ndeveloped in the future. Although simple magnetospheric\nmodels exist for all the planets, except for the Earth\n(Fig. 3.2) these need to be made more quantitative to\ndetermine actual magnetopause and magnetosheath cross-\nings for instruments. Finally, computer codes capable of\ntracing out the field lines from the magnetic field models are\nneeded for the radiation belt models (the latter typically\nrequire so-called \u2018B and L\u2019 coordinates) and are readily\navailable. Although currently little information exists, the\nmagnetic fields of comets and perhaps asteroids will also\nneed to be defined during early planning of missions to\nthese bodies.\n\n3.2.3 Ultraviolet Radiation\n\nUltraviolet (UV) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV or XUV)\nradiation is important for spacecraft interactions as it can\nchange the surface chemistry of materials and causes\n\nFig. 3.1 Number density\nprofiles for the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere based on the US\nStandard Atmosphere, 1976 [2]\n\n3 Space Environments and Survivability 39\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nphotoelectron emission. The UV/EUV radiation is the con-\ntinuum and line spectrum between roughly 10 and 4,000 \u00c5.\nThe solar flux/energy in this spectral range is between 107\n\nand 1010 photons/(cm2 s) below 1,000 \u00c5 and rises expo-\nnentially to 1016 photons/(cm2 s) between 1,000 and\n10,000 \u00c5. Note that the Lyman-alpha line at 1,216 \u00c5 plays a\nmajor role in photoelectron emission. The shortest wave-\nlengths, from 10 to 100 \u00c5, are called X-rays. The solar\nspectrum at 1 au1 is illustrated in Fig. 3.3a [4], while\nFig. 3.3b presents the ASTM E490-00a(2006) Standard\nSolar Constant and Zero Air Mass (AM0) Solar Spectral\nIrradiance, which has an integrated power of\n1,366.1 W m-2. The ASTM E490 standard does not cover\nthe complete solar spectrum but does extend from a wave-\nlength of 119.5 lm to 1 m [5]; an ISO standard is also\navailable, see ISO-21348. Note that the solar spectrum can\nalso be represented simplistically as a black-body of effective\ntemperature 5,781 K, whilst the Earth radiates as a black-\nbody at 254 K. Models of the UV/EUV spectra and the\natmospheric attenuation at the Earth and the planets of the\nUV/EUV are available if attenuation effects for sensors or\nphotoemission are needed\u2014models also exist for estimating\nspacecraft charging effects during eclipse passage.\n\n3.2.4 Infrared\n\nThe infrared (IR) spectrum is between roughly wavelengths\nof 0.7 and 7 lm and is dominated by the Sun (Fig. 3.3).\nOther sources of IR are reflected sunlight, atmospheric\nglow, radiation from planets, and even light from auroral\ndisplays. The IR environment is a major source of thermal\neffects on spacecraft. As in the case of the UV/EUV region,\ndetailed spectra are readily available.\n\n3.2.5 Solar Wind Plasma\n\nThe solar wind is a neutral plasma, primarily consisting of\nelectrons, protons, and alpha particles, which flows\napproximately radially from the Sun at velocities ranging\nfrom 400 to 2,500 km/s. Since the Sun rotates in just over\n27 days, as the solar wind expands outward the plasma\ndrags the Sun\u2019s magnetic field lines out in an Archimedean\nspiral in the solar equatorial plane (Fig. 3.4). Densities\n(mean energies) range from around 50 particles cm-3\n\n(*40 eV for ions; *65 eV for electrons) near Mercury to\n0.2 particles cm-3 (1 eV for ions; 10 eV for electrons) at\nJupiter. Solar wind models are necessary for design pur-\nposes ranging from missions near the Sun to the outer solar\nsystem\u2014a good example of such models is the NASA\nMarshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) L2-CPE statistical\nmodel [6]. Such models are used to estimate plasma inter-\nactions with spacecraft, large solar sails, comets, or aster-\noids, and for estimating effects on plasma sensors or\n\nFig. 3.2 Profile of the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetosphere showing the\nmagnetic field lines and structure.\nImage NASA\n\n1 An astronomical unit is a unit of length defined as exactly 1.495 978\n70691(6) x 1011 m, approximatly the average Earth\u2013Sun distance, and\nis accepted for use with the Syst\u00e8me international d\u2019unit\u00e9s.

These plasmas induce spacecraft surface\npotentials of typically *10 V\u2014the highest reported surface\npotential in the solar wind being *100 V. Plasma interac-\ntion models for estimating effects of the solar wind are\navailable for general design purposes\u2014examples are the\nNascap-2 K [7] and various particle in a cell (PIC) codes.\n\n3.2.6 Ionospheric Plasma\n\nThe ionized component of a planetary atmosphere, the ion-\nosphere, is typically a comparatively dense, \u2018cold\u2019 plasma.\n\nFor the Earth, the composition varies from an O+ dominated\nenvironment between *200 and 500 km with a maximum\ndensity of about 106 cm-3, to H+ dominated above\n1,000\u20131,200 km with densities from 105 cm-3 at 500 km, to\n103 cm-3 or less above 2,000 km, see Fig. 3.5. All the\nplanets (and most large moons) have ionospheres with\ncompositions characteristic of their neutral atmospheres. In\naddition to spacecraft surface charging (typically of little\nconcern compared to auroral-induced charging), iono-\nspheres affect radio wave propagation and are important for\ntheir effects on spacecraft communications. Simple static\nprofiles currently exist for all the planets and Titan.\n\nFig. 3.3 a Electromagnetic flux\nat 1 au showing the frequency\nrange from gamma (c)-rays/X-\nrays through visible frequencies\nto IR and radio waves,\nreproduced from [4] and b the\nASTM E490-00a(2006) Standard\nZero Air Mass Solar Spectral\nIrradiance [5]\n\n3 Space Environments and Survivability 41\n\n\n\n3.2.7 Aurora Plasma\n\nAbove the ionosphere and typically at the magnetic field\nboundary between high latitude, closed and quasi-closed\nmagnetic field lines is a \u2018hot\u2019 plasma of substantially lower\ndensity than the ionosphere but much higher energy (the\n\u2018plasma sheet\u2019 region in Fig. 3.2). These particles (primar-\nily electrons and protons) precipitate into the atmosphere\ngenerating bright arc structures called auroras. Near the\nEarth\u2019s geostationary orbit (the equatorward extension of\nthe auroral plasma), densities are on the order of *1 cm-3\n\nand mean energies of several tens of keV. This plasma can\ngive rise to surface potentials of 20 kV or more. Auroras are\nregularly observed at Jupiter and Saturn and there are\nobservations at Uranus and Neptune (Ganymede also has\nwhat appears to be auroras). As auroras pose a potential\nspacecraft charging threat, they need to be considered when\nevaluating a spacecraft\u2019s charging mitigation system.\n\n3.2.8 Trapped Radiation\n\nSuperimposed on the closed magnetic field lines of the\nionosphere and auroral regimes are the high energy\n(E [ 100 keV) trapped electron and proton populations\u2014\nthe so-called van Allen belts. The important components are\nthe electrons with energies between 100 keV to a few MeV\nand protons with energies from 100 keV to 100 MeV.\nJupiter and the Earth have the most damaging radiation\n\nbelts, though radiation belts exist at Saturn, Uranus, and\nNeptune. For terrestrial missions, the NASA AE8/AP8\nradiation models have been the primary ones used, but the\nAE9/AP9 models will shortly supersede these. Jovian\n(GIRE) and Saturnian (SATRAD) radiation models are\navailable from JPL. The Jovian model contains several\n\u2018holes\u2019; for example, a lack of a complete statistical\nunderstanding and proper modeling of time and pitch angle\nvariations. Preliminary models have also been developed\nfor Uranus and Neptune based on the Voyager flybys. The\nterrestrial and Jovian radiation belt contours for electrons\nand protons are illustrated in Fig. 3.6.\n\n3.2.9 Galactic Cosmic Rays\n\nThe galactic cosmic ray (GCR) environment consists pri-\nmarily of interplanetary protons and ionized heavy nuclei\nwith energies from *1 MeV/nucleon to higher than\n*100 GeV/nucleon. Electrons are also a constituent of\nGCR, but their measured intensities at energies above\n*10 MeV are at least 1 order of magnitude smaller than the\nprotons and are usually ignored. The principal element\nrange of interest is from hydrogen to iron. Models of the\nGCR currently exist for interplanetary space and even for\ninterstellar space (Fig. 3.7) as the Voyager spacecraft are\ncurrently crossing into the \u2018pristine\u2019 interstellar medium.\nDifficulties arise when modeling the detailed spectra for a\ngiven orbit within a magnetic field. Models for the Earth are\navailable but the ability to model GCR transport at other\nplanets is limited. For mission design purposes, it is normal\nto assume a \u2018worst case\u2019 environment (for example, ignor-\ning magnetic shielding). Models of the in situ, trapped\nheavy ion environments at the Earth and Jupiter are also\navailable for design purposes.\n\nFig. 3.4 View of the solar wind magnetic field lines showing how\nthey are dragged out in an Archimedean spiral in the solar ecliptic\nplane as the Sun rotates. vsw is the radial solar wind velocity vector\n\nFig. 3.5 Total ionization profile, with ionospheric layers, adapted\nfrom [4]\n\n42 H. B. Garrett\n\n\n\n3.2.10 Solar Proton Events\n\nHydrogen and heavy nuclei in the *0.1 to *100 MeV/\nnucleon energy range are ejected during a solar proton event\n(SPE) or, as it is also called, a solar energetic particle (SEP)\nevent. Intensities are generally a few to several orders of\nmagnitude larger than those of the GCR at these lower\nenergies during these brief events (typically a few days or\nless in duration). The worst-case solar proton flux is\napproximately five orders of magnitude larger than the\n\nGCR, but becomes \u2018softer\u2019 above *100 MeV where the\nGCR begin to dominate the spectrum.\n\nThe energetic particles that make up these events are\nbelieved to come from two primary processes: acceleration\nat the surface of Sun in association with sunspots (so-called\nsolar flares) or at the edge of a rapidly expanding coronal\nmass ejection (CME) in the solar wind. SPEs created by\neither process are, after trapped radiation, the major natural\nradiation of concern to spacecraft designers.

The mass range is from 10-12 g dust grains to 1022 g\nfor asteroids and comets (Fig. 3.8). Densities range from\n0.5 g/cm3 (fluffy ice) to between 3.5 g/cm3 (stony) and\n8.5 g/cm3 (iron/nickel). Impact velocities range from 11 to\n70 km/s (the latter particles are believed to be of interstellar\norigin) with mean values around 20 to 30 km/s. Currently,\nthere are several models available, including the new MSFC\nMeteoroid Engineering Model (MEM) [9] and the older\nJPL-developed METeoroid Engineering Model (METEM)\n[10]. MEM incorporates the latest meteoroid data and is\nprimarily intended for the 1 au environment. METEM pro-\nvides interplanetary meteoroids from Mercury out to Saturn.\nThe latter has modules for planetary focusing effects and\nplanetary shielding. The METEM model is particularly\nuseful for angular impact estimates and has seen wide use\nwithin the community. The database it uses is dated, how-\never, and does not incorporate any of the new data that have\nbecome available since its debut.\n\n3.2.12 Synthetic Debris\n\nSpace flight operations have led to an artificial shell of\nsynthetic debris around the Earth. This shell of debris poses\na greater threat than the natural meteoroid environment\nwithin 2,000 km of the Earth. Typical mass densities are\n2.5 g/cm3 and impact velocities are *10 km/s. The Orbital\nDebris Engineering Model ORDEM2000 by the Johnson\nSpace Center (JSC) is perhaps the primary debris model and\nis available to download from the NASA Orbital Debris\nProgram Office at JSC [11]. However, the ESA Meteoroid\nand Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference\n(MASTER) and Program for Radar and Observation Fore-\ncasting (PROOF) models are also widely available and are\nrecommended by the ECSS standards. The ORDEM2000\nmodel provides estimates of the near-Earth debris on a\ngiven date and unlike the ESA MASTER model, which is\nhistorical, includes spacecraft launch rates and impacts that\ncan be used to project the future debris population. It should\nbe noted however that ESA\u2019s Debris Environment Long-\nTerm Analysis (DELTA) tool can be used in conjunction\nwith the MASTER tool to determine future debris trends.\nRepresentative debris fluxes are compared with the mete-\noroid environment in Fig. 3.9.\n\n3.2.13 Dust\n\nAn environment of increasing concern for which there are\nfew models is dust. Significant dust environments have been\nobserved at the Moon, Mars, and comets. Mars dust storms\nand dust devils and the very \u2018sticky\u2019 lunar dust that astro-\nnauts encountered are well-known problem environments.\nIn the past, mission-unique models for specific comet mis-\nsions have been developed but they are not well defined.\nModels of the in situ comet dust environment are important\nas this can seriously affect operations during flybys\n(hypervelocity impacts) or landings (contamination). \u2018Dusty\nplasmas\u2019 in this environment\u2014dust that behaves as a\n\nFig. 3.8 Annual integral interplanetary meteoroid fluencies versus\nmass at 1 au for two standard meteoroid models\n\nFig. 3.9 Annual interplanetary meteoroid and space debris fluxes\nversus diameter at the Earth for various altitudes\n\n44 H. B. Garrett\n\n\n\ncollection of charged particles\u2014are another complication.\nThis relatively new environment needs to be carefully\nconsidered because of the adhesion of the charged particles\non surfaces.\n\n3.3 Interactions\n\nThe anticipated sophistication and complexity of future\nspace systems will greatly enhance their sensitivity to\nenvironmental interactions, and make what would otherwise\nhave been second-order effects potentially critical problems\nfor survivability. The purpose of this section is to review\nthese interactions and relate them to possible areas of\nconcern for the technologist.\n\nEach category of interaction will be briefly defined in\nthis section and examples provided of potential effects on a\nspacecraft and its subsystems. In defining these categories,\nit should be kept in mind that to some degree they overlap\nas several of the interactions are manifestations of a com-\nmon underlying phenomenon (i.e., energy deposition or\nmechanical stress).\n\n3.3.1 Cumulative Radiation Effects\n\nCumulative radiation effects depend on the type of particles,\ntheir energy, and their charge. A high-energy particle can\ntransmute a material (change the atomic species and make\nthe material radioactive), change its atomic structure (dis-\nplacement damage), or produce free radicals, ions, and\nelectron\u2013hole pairs. Electronic parts and material charac-\nteristics thus slowly degrade with time due to these effects.\nA common measure of damage is total dose. Dose is the\namount of energy deposited per unit mass of the absorbing\nmaterial. An example is the total ionizing dose (TID) which\nis a measure of the energy deposited in a mass of material\ncreating ionized charge pairs\u2014typical units are 100 ergs/\ngm or 1 rad. Note that: the material has to be specified, e.g.,\n\u2018Si\u2019 for silicon. For reference, commercial off-the-shelf\n(COTS) parts are typically \u2018hard\u2019 to sometimes as much as\n10 Krads(Si), while space-qualified parts are typically\n\u2018harder\u2019 than 10 Krads(Si); \u2018rad-hard\u2019 parts are\n100 Krad(Si) or higher and parts harder than 1 Mrad(Si) are\n\u2018nuclear hardened\u2019.\n\nFor engineering purposes, a dose versus depth curve is\nusually prepared for the design. In the early stages, this is\ndone for a generic mass distribution\u2014solid sphere, spheri-\ncal shell, flat plate (or slab), two flat plates, etc. A set of\ncalculations for the Clementine lunar missions is presented\nin Fig. 3.10. As shown in the figures, electrons are much\nmore sensitive to the details of the shielding geometry\nthan ions.\n\n3.3.2 Single Event Upsets\n\nThe term single event effects (SEE) encompasses a variety\nof radiation-induced upsets in microelectronics. Of partic-\nular interest are single event upsets (SEU). SEUs are pro-\nduced in an integrated circuit when a single charged particle\npasses through the circuit and causes a change in the state of\na digital logic element leading to data loss or incorrect\ncommands. As an energetic particle travels through a circuit\nelement, it may deposit energy (producing ionization and a\ncurrent pulse) sufficient to trigger the element (Fig. 3.11a).\nThe energy loss is principally proportional to the square of\nthe particles electrical charge, Z, but if nuclear interactions\noccur within the part, this rate can be substantially\nincreased. Hence, more abundant low-Z ions deposit as\nmuch energy as less abundant high-Z ions. Figure 3.11b\nillustrates the actual effects on a Hubble Space Telescope\nCCD element\u2014note the bright pixels that were \u2018flipped\u2019.\nThe basic measure of energy transfer is linear energy\ntransfer (LET) typically given in MeV cm2/mg, which is the\nenergy lost by the particle to the material per unit path\nlength (MeV/cm) divided by the density of the material\n(mg/cm3). Hence, multiplying LET by the density of the\nmaterial being impacted gives the energy deposited per unit\nlength in the material. The SEU rate for each circuit element\nneeds to be evaluated for all the sensitive devices associated\nwith a subsystem on the spacecraft. Figure 3.12 presents\nrepresentative SPE and GCR fluxes versus LET for varying\nlevels of shielding\u2014shielding has a large effect on SPEs but\nnot much on GCRs; parts with LETs above *30 must be\nselected to significantly reduce GCR rates.\n\n3.3.3 Latchup\n\nAnother form of an SEE is latchup. The passage of an\nenergetic particle through a sensitive device can sometimes\ncreate a transient short circuit or current path. In the case of\nlatchup, this can turn on a parasitic silicon controlled rec-\ntifier (SCR) resulting in either a loss of circuit function or\nthermal runaway from the excessive current. The latter can\ncause permanent damage. If detected early, both can be\nmitigated by powering down the device. Given the possi-\nbility of permanent damage by this effect, it needs to be\nevaluated for all potentially sensitive integrated circuits.\n\n3.3.4 Surface Charging/Wakes\n\nSurfaces immersed in a space plasma will charge to a\npotential relative to the plasma. In sunlight, this is typically\na few volts positive due to photoelectron currents. In sha-\ndow, to first order, the potential is proportional to the\n\n3 Space Environments and Survivability 45\n\n\n\nambient electron temperature (Fig. 3.13a) and current.\nThese potentials can be over 10\u201320 kV (negative relative to\nthe space plasma ground) and can produce differential\npotentials over 1,000 V between electrically isolated sur-\nfaces. Representative surface potentials in eclipse for the\nEarth are presented in Fig. 3.13b. As arcing may occur\nbetween charged surfaces with potential differences as little\nas 200 V, this can be a serious environmental concern.\n\nIn conjunction with surface charging, a plasmasheath is\noften created, the scale of which is characterized by the\nDebye length, denoted as either kD or LD. The formation of\nthis sheath can be understood by considering the effect of\nplacing a surface with no initial net charge into a plasma. At\nfirst, more electrons than ions will strike the surface due to\nthe higher thermal speed of electrons; high-energy electrons\ncan penetrate several millimeters, charging internal dielec-\ntrics, while lower energy electrons and ions deposit charge\non the surface. This electron/ion strike rate imbalance\ncauses the surface to charge negatively until the charge is\nsufficient to repel further electrons and to attract ions. At\nequilibrium, the electron/ion currents to the surface balance.\nA region is formed above the surface within which the\npositive ions outnumber the electrons, shielding the nega-\ntive surface potential. Outside the structure, that is the\nplasmasheath, the ambient plasma does not see the net\nnegative potential.\n\nIn the ionosphere the Debye length is typically less than\napproximately 10 cm, however in the magnetosphere it can\nbe from 0.1 to 1 km. If the Debye length is smaller than the\ncharacteristic length of the spacecraft the plasmasheath will\nprovide a conductive path between different parts of the\nspacecraft, keeping the potential relatively even. However,\nlarge potential differences can still occur in the wake region,\nwhere the Debye length can be locally large. If the Debye\nlength is larger than the characteristic length of the spacecraft\nthen large potential differences can develop on electrically\nisolated spacecraft surfaces causing potentially damaging arc\ndischarges that can be a serious concern for solar cell sys-\ntems, where exposing a semiconductor to sunlight is a\nrequired condition of operation. Debye shielding can have a\nserious effect on particle and field detector instruments, as\nthe presence of the spacecraft alters the very field that the\ninstruments are attempting to measure. As such, instruments\nare typically placed on electrically isolated structures that\nextend beyond the Debye shield of the spacecraft and can be\nbiased relative to the spacecraft ground.\n\nFig. 3.10 Representative dose/\ndepth curves for the Clementine\nlunar mission showing the\ndifferences between different\nshielding geometries for protons\n(a) and electrons (b). Note that\n1 mil = 1/1,000th of an\nInternational Inch, which is\nexactly 25.4 mm\n\nFig. 3.11 Examples of SEU effects. a Schematic illustrates the\nprocess of charge deposition in a microcircuit element that leads to a\nbit flip. b CCD image from the Hubble Space Telescope as it passed\nthrough the South Atlantic Anomaly showing the effects of SEU\nevents on the CCD pixels\n\n46 H. B. Garrett\n\n\n\nThough normally of little concern, in moderate to dense\nplasmas like the ionosphere the vehicle\u2019s velocity relative to\nthe plasma can produce a charged wake structure around the\nvehicle (and sensors) altering the currents and electromag-\nnetic fields around it. Ionospheric ions typically have ther-\nmal velocities lower than the orbital velocity; as such, the\nmotion of the structure causes the plasma density to build\nup in the ram direction, with a consequently low-density\nregion occurring in the structure\u2019s wake. Density deviations\ncan be several orders of magnitude from the ambient and\nthe Debye length in wake can be locally very large, which\ntends to be negatively charged as plasma electrons typically\nhave a greater velocity than ions. In addition to distortions\nin particle and field measurements, the dense plasma can\n\nalso lead to enhanced power loss (positive surfaces that\ndraw electrons) to arcing (negatively charged surfaces). The\nInternational Space Station (ISS) flies plasma contactors to\nminimize these effects.\n\n3.3.5 Internal Charging\n\nIn addition to surface charging, internal electrostatic charg-\ning/discharging (IESD) (also called buried charging) is a\nvery real concern\u2014particularly at the Earth (Fig. 3.14) and\nJupiter. High energy electrons (100 keV or higher) can easily\npenetrate spacecraft surfaces and deposit charge on or in\ninternal surfaces, but protons of the same energy are stopped\n\nFig. 3.12 Annual GCR and\nsolar proton event fluxes for\nvarious shielding thicknesses.\nImage J. M. Ratliff\n\nFig. 3.13 Surface charging\neffects for the Earth.\na Comparison of observed\nsurface potentials in solar eclipse\nat geosynchronous orbit for the\nATS-5 and ATS-6 spacecraft\nversus plasma temperature.\nb Estimates of the surface\npotential in eclipse versus\nposition for the midnight\nmeridian\n\n3 Space Environments and Survivability 47\n\n\n\nat the surface (Fig. 3.14)\u2014the resulting differential charging\ncan lead to arcing inside the normal Faraday cage of the\nspacecraft. At least 2.5 mm of aluminum shielding is typi-\ncally needed in the Earth\u2019s environment to prevent this effect.\nMethods for estimating the effects of internal and surface\ncharging and mitigating their effects are presented in [12].\n\n3.3.6 Power Loss\n\nAlthough normally of limited concern, as power systems\n(particularly solar arrays and electrodynamic tethers)\napproach 200 V or more in operating voltage, positive\npotential surfaces can experience parasitic power losses.\nAny exposed positive surfaces (perhaps pin holes in insu-\nlation such as produced by micrometeoroid impacts) will\nattract electrons\u2014for potentials of approximately 200 V or\nhigher, the electrons will receive sufficient energy to gen-\nerate dense clouds of secondary electrons. This plasma\ncloud effectively defeats the insulation and results in high\nambient electron currents and power loss over positively\ncharged surfaces.\n\n3.3.7 Lorentz Effect\n\nA conducting body crossing a magnetic field will experience\nan induced electric field proportional to the cross (or vector)\nproduct of the instantaneous velocity, V, and the magnetic\nfield, B, that is (V 9 B)\u2014the Lorentz effect. In low Earth\norbit, this can be as high as 0.3 V/m. Much higher values are\nexperienced at Jupiter\u2014approximately 60 V/m over the\npolar caps for the Juno mission. At the Earth, induced\nvoltages of 10 V have been seen on the Shuttle and over\n\n100 V on the ISS. For a 100 km long tether (possible with\ntoday\u2019s technology), potentials of approximately 10,000 V\ncould be generated and the tether used as a power source (in\nreturn for a decrease in altitude). Given the varying nature of\nthe potentials across a structure as it rotates, V 9 B poten-\ntials can be very annoying for some spacecraft.\n\n3.3.8 Surface Damages\n\nArc crazing/blow-off, sputtering, ablation due to the neutral\natmosphere, EUV-induced chemical changes, radiation\ndamage (especially for Teflon), and other effects can seri-\nously damage exposed spacecraft surfaces. Oxygen erosion\nin low Earth orbit has been found to be a serious problem\nfor many organic compounds (Kapton in particular) and a\nfew metals (silver and osmium). Even a few days spent in\nlow Earth orbit can seriously damage some types of surface\nand, in the case of the Long Duration Exposure Facility\n(LDEF), entire surface samples were found to disappear\nafter a few years of exposure. Finally, micrometeoroid\nimpacts can fracture solar array cover glasses, penetrate\ncabling, and similarly degrade surfaces. Such degradation\nwill lead to long-term decay in surface properties and must\nbe considered in the selection of surface materials and\nappropriate coatings or shielding.\n\n3.3.9 Contamination\n\nOutgassing, thruster firings, gas leaks, water dumps, erosion\nof surfaces, flaking of paints, and long term curing of\nepoxies can all contribute to the contamination environment\naround a spacecraft. Charging can lead to enhanced\n\nFig. 3.14 Internal charging effects for the Earth. Left provides\nestimates of regions of IESD concern for circular orbits. Right gives\nthe mean penetration depth of electrons and protons in aluminum. As\nillustrated, a 1 MeV electron penetrates as deeply as a proton of over\n\n20 MeV (as there are many times fewer protons at the higher energy,\nnegative charge builds up leading to IESD). Note that 1 mil = 1/\n1,000th of the International Inch, which is exactly 25.4 mm\n\n48 H. B. Garrett\n\n\n\ndeposition rates on some surfaces while EUV and radiation\ncan alter the chemical effects of the contamination. From\nchanges in alpha/epsilon to the glint of small contaminate\nparticles in the field of view of a sensor or the degradation of\noptical transmission properties, contamination is a serious\nproblem. Water in particular is a pervasive and potentially\nhighly damaging contaminant (nitrogen purges and expen-\nsive ground handling techniques are consequences). Control\nand limitation of such contamination effects is an important\nfactor that needs to be included in a survivable design.\n\n3.3.10 Atmospheric Glow\n\nAlthough it has only been detected at the Earth so far, serious\noptical contamination in the form of a visible glow on sur-\nfaces facing into the spacecraft velocity vector has been\nobserved for orbits of 800 km altitude or lower. Figure 3.15\nshows an example of this glow along the vertical stabilizer\nand Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods for the Shuttle.\nThe phenomenon may result from the interaction of atomic\noxygen with spacecraft surfaces, as the glow intensity appears\nto vary with the atomic oxygen density. The interaction\ngenerates optical emissions, primarily in the orange range of\nthe spectrum (apparently consistent with the emission spec-\ntrum of NO2) that can contaminate sensitive IR sensors. As\nthe glow appears to come primarily from surfaces in the ram\ndirection and to be enhanced during thruster firings, careful\nplacement of optical sensors and timing of thruster firings\nmay need to be considered in the mission design.\n\n3.3.11 Particle Impacts\n\nHypervelocity impacts from a few km/s and up between\nmeteoroids or synthetic space debris and spacecraft can be\ndevastating. Interplanetary meteoroid impact velocities\naverage between 20 and 30 km/s (impact velocities as high as\n500 km/s, however, may occur near the Sun during a close\nperihelion passage) whereas space debris impacts are typi-\ncally 10 km/s. At the Earth, particles with velocities of\napproximately 70 km/s or greater are believed to be of\ninterstellar origin. Effects range from pitting to complete\npenetration of walls or even total destruction of a spacecraft.\nWiring and pressure vessels (for example, crew quarters or\nfuel tanks) are particularly sensitive to these effects. Mete-\noroid shielding is thus a very important consideration for\nmany missions\u2014particularly those to the outer planets where\neven small pits in the engine nozzles or fuel tanks could lead to\ncatastrophic failures. Externally exposed long cable runs and\nwire antennas are of particular concern as these are usually\nthin but very long leading to large areas (greatly increasing\ntheir likelihood of getting hit) which could be severed by\n\nrelatively small particles. Figure 3.17 illustrates the effects of\na hypervelocity particle impact on a plate\u2014the particle comes\nin from the left and exits on the right. Note how the debris\ncloud expands in a roughly spherical shape (Fig. 3.16).\n\n3.3.12 Torques\n\nThe effects of small forces on the stability of spacecraft are\nwell known to cause degradation in pointing accuracy and\nmechanical deformation. Thermal effects (for example,\nexpansion/contraction of booms), light pressure, gravity\ngradients, atmospheric drag, meteoroid impacts, and mag-\nnetic torques can all cause instabilities. Even arc discharges\ncan impart a measurable impulse. The potential torques on a\nspacecraft associated with 500 km/s impacts near the Sun\nmay be particularly critical for this class of missions. The\nsensitivity of the spacecraft to such torques needs to be\nevaluated for each class.\n\n3.3.13 Thermal\n\nThermal effects (specifically, the effects of varying tem-\nperature and thermal radiation on components) are probably\nthe most important environmental concern for spacecraft.\nOf particular concern are issues associated with the thermal\nprotection system, as it is often intimately involved with the\ndesign of the exterior surfaces of the spacecraft. To reduce\nmass, design efforts should concentrate on integrating the\nthermal blanket layout with the meteoroid and spacecraft\ncharging mitigation systems. Typical areas of concern are\nthe conductivity of the thermal blankets, nuclear battery\n[i.e., radioisotope power source (RPS)] or nuclear reactor\n\nFig. 3.15 Space Shuttle Columbia during a night pass on STS-62,\nMarch 1994. Image documents the glow phenomenon surrounding the\nvertical stabilizer and the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods of\nthe spacecraft; NASA Photo ID: STS062-42-026. Image NASA\n\n3 Space Environments and Survivability 49\n\n\n\nplacement, optical surface reflectors (OSR), thermal sensors\n(which can pick up stray EM pulses), and, for missions\nclose to the Sun, heat shields. As white paints and Kapton-\nbased thermal blankets, the most common thermal control\nsolutions, are typically non-conductive and sources of arc\ndischarges, there can be complex trade-offs when carrying\nout a survivability design.\n\n3.3.14 Other Effects\n\nDensity fluctuations in the ionosphere lead to enhancements\nand depletions in the electron density along a radio fre-\nquency (RF) propagation path. These processes can distort\nthe phase and amplitude of a signal to and from a space-\ncraft. In addition to the Earth, typical ionospheric properties\n\nand actual measurements are available for several of the\nplanets and the Sun (radio occultation measurements being\na common source). Auroras, the galaxy, and the Sun are all\nnatural sources of background RF that can further hamper\ncommunications in space. Except in special cases, they are\nconsidered to be of secondary importance to typical elec-\ntromagnetic compatibility (EMC) sources on the spacecraft\nitself and are ignored for design purposes.\n\nThe ambient environment has numerous sources of stray\nlight. Besides the Sun itself which causes significant noise\nacross the entire electromagnetic spectrum, stars, starlight,\ngegenschein (German for \u2018counter shine\u2019; a faint brightening\nof the night sky in the region of the antisolar point), the\nzodiacal light (a faint, roughly triangular, whitish glow seen in\nthe night sky that appears to extend up from the vicinity of the\nSun along the ecliptic or zodiac), atmospheric glow, the\n\nFig. 3.16 Effect of\nhypervelocity impacts; a the\ncloud of particles produced by a\nhypervelocity impact, b a\nwindow pit from orbital debris on\nthe Space Shuttle Challenger\nduring STS-7 and c a view of an\norbital debris hole made in the\npanel of the Solar Maximum\nMission, SolarMax, satellite\n\n50 H. B. Garrett\n\n\n\nauroras, the equatorial electrojet, the polar cap aurora, and\nmoonlight all contribute background light in the UV, EUV,\nand IR. Lately, at the Earth even city lights and oil flares have\nbecome a serious concern in making ground observations\nfrom space; see Fig. 3.17 and other representative images\nfrom the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)\nwhich have been particularly useful in bringing this problem\nto the attention of the public. These effects are considered to be\nof secondary importance in an integrated design (Fig. 3.18).\n\nRapidly oscillating fields on surfaces can cause serious\ninteractions with space plasma. In particular, depending on\nthe electron density, the mechanical spacing of the ele-\nments, and other factors, a resonance phenomenon called\nmultipacting can be induced between the surfaces. Briefly,\nelectrons accelerated into the surface by the time-varying\npositive component of the field can generate secondaries.\nThese secondaries in turn (if the spacing and timing are\ncorrect) can generate more secondaries when they impact,\ncausing a plasma avalanche. The cloud of electrons can lead\nto significant losses in signal strength and drain power from\na transmitter. Whereas power loss is primarily a direct\ncurrent (DC) process, this is an alternating current (AC)\neffect. The simulation of this phenomenon, unlike many\nother environmental effects, is fairly straightforward with\nthe ambient environment playing only a secondary role\nonce the process is initiated as the secondary electrons\ncreated quickly outnumber the ambients. Even so, systems\nmust take this effect into account and be tested under ion-\nospheric plasma conditions and, if possible, under the\nappropriate neutral atmosphere conditions before flight.\n\n3.3.15 Interactions Versus Environments Trade\nMatrix\n\nThe matrix in Table 3.2 compares the key design environ-\nments for spacecraft with the critical interactions. For every\n\nmission the technologist needs to identify the relevant\nmission environments and then determine the specific\ninteractions of concern for that mission and its different\nphases. This has been done for three representative cases: a\nmission to Europa (E or e), an outer solar system mission to\nthe dwarf planet Pluto (P or p), and a solar probe-like\nmission (S or s). Also indicated is whether the interaction is\na major (capital letter) or minor (lower case letter) concern.\nSuch assessments are very dependent on the specific mis-\nsion but are helpful in identifying the critical interaction\nconcerns. As such, this should be the first step in developing\nan integrated, survivable design.\n\nFig. 3.17 Image of Earth\u2019s city\nlights created with data from the\nDefense Meteorological Satellite\nProgram (DMSP), Operational\nLinescan System (OLS).\nOriginally designed to view\nclouds by moonlight, the OLS\nwas used to map the locations of\npermanent lights on the Earth\u2019s\nsurface.

Image US Navy Fleet Numerical\nMeteorology and Oceanography Center\n\n3 Space Environments and Survivability 51\n\n\n\n3.4 Design Options\n\nIn this section the design trade space, namely the design\noptions available to the reliability engineer for mitigating\nspecific interactions will be described. Examples range from\nshielding for meteoroid impacts and blankets for thermal\ncontrol to the careful selection of conductive materials for\nspacecraft charging and radiation protection. In particular,\nTables 3.3 and 3.4 list some of the major design options\nfor mitigating space environment effects. Representative\nmitigation options are discussed in more depth in the fol-\nlowing sections.\n\n3.4.1 Shielding\n\nProbably the best-known environmental mitigation method\nis shielding. A number of shielding methods exist for miti-\ngating specific interactions. For radiation and hypervelocity\nimpacts in particular, shielding has proven to be a primary\nmeans of limiting their effects. Indeed, as the major objective\nis typically to place physical mass between the impactor\n(atomic or particulate) and the target, the methods for miti-\ngating both are similar. The first step is typically to account\nfor the intrinsic spacecraft body shielding. Where necessary,\nsensitive elements such as radiation-soft electronic compo-\nnents can be protected by bulk shielding, perhaps by encas-\ning assemblies or spacecraft subsystems within a box of\nhigh-Z materials\u2014referred to as a doghouse or vault. Or, for\nthe case of hypervelocity impacts, by a specially designed,\nmulti-layer meteoroid Whipple shield for crew quarters or\nfuel tanks. Special shielding plates can be placed between\nassemblies or slices in a stack. A specific technique for\nparticularly radiation-soft parts is a so-called spot shield\u2014\nthis can be effective in conserving shielding mass. For other\ninteractions there are similar techniques. In the case of\nelectromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and electromagnetic\ninterference (EMI), often termed EMC/EMI, an electrically\nconductive Faraday cage is usually employed. Baffles and\ndeflectors are used to limit thruster contamination while in-\nflight removable covers may be used for science instruments.\n\n3.4.2 Positioning\n\nClosely tied to the use of shielding is positioning\u2014the\nplacement or orientation of critical components or surfaces\nto minimize the effects of the environment. Examples are\nthe placement of radiation sensitive devices as far as pos-\nsible from a nuclear power source or the orientation of a\nsurface relative to the velocity vector to minimize the\nmeteoroid fluence. Each of these forms of positioning can\nyield significant reductions in specific effects and may have\n\nlittle or no impact on a system design. Examples are listed\nin Table 3.3.\n\n3.4.3 Material Properties\n\nProper material selection for a specific environment can\nsignificantly improve the lifetime and reliability of a space\nsystem. Careful selection of materials can both limit and\nprevent many types of environmental interaction. As dis-\ncussed earlier, there may be complex trade-offs between\nconductivity requirements, thermal paints, and radiation\nsensitivity. The steps required to identify the appropriate\nmaterials for mitigating interactions are listed in Table 3.4.\n\n3.4.4 Electronic Parts Selection\n\nElectronic parts are a critical component of a spacecraft\ndesign. Parts engineers need to evaluate a range of param-\neters in identifying the appropriate components for a spe-\ncific mission. A parts engineer must trade cost and\navailability versus the class of a part\u2014for example, radia-\ntion-hard, space-qualified (Class S or Class B) parts versus\ncommercial parts. Note that failure rates of Class S parts are\ngenerally about a quarter of the rate for Class B parts [13].\nThe relationship between the classes is detailed in Table 3.5\n[13]. The parts engineer must trade the known greater cost\nand limited availability of radiation-hard parts against the\ncosts of radiation testing or the advantages of more capable\ncommercial (non-radiation-hard) parts. Note that typically\nredundancy is not a justification for using a lower class part\nas it provides a lower reliability payoff at the point where it\nis needed. Maverick parts, production flaws, and other\nuncertainties, however, justify redundancy for critical cir-\ncuits in high-reliability, long-life applications to protect\nagainst random failures [13]. For long-life, the use of high-\nreliability hardware, Class S parts, and redundancy in crit-\nical applications can provide an optimum and cost-effective\napproach. Parts also need to be evaluated for their electro-\nstatic discharge (ESD), sensitivity.

B. Garrett\n\n\n\neffects need to be given special consideration in the system\ndesign. It is strongly recommended to perform a failure\nmode, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA), parts\nstress analysis, worst-case analysis, and/or voltage, tem-\nperature, and frequency margin tests. In the case of\nspacecraft charging, the NASA Handbook 4002A [12] may\nbe followed. Finally, all spacecraft circuitry should be\nanalyzed and tested for electromagnetic compatibility\n(EMC) and electromagnetic interference (EMI), EMC/\nEMI.\n\n3.4.6 Grounding\n\nProper grounding methods need to be considered in any\nelectrical design. Standard techniques are described in\nNASA Handbook 4001 [14]. Typical methods are to pro-\nvide a ground reference or resistive bleed path for circuit\nelements at all times\u2014designers should choose system\nelectrical and electronic grounding architecture to avoid\nstructure currents and ground loops.\n\n3.4.7 Trajectory\n\nAn obvious method for limiting environmental concerns is\nthrough careful orbital trajectory selection. A mission\nplanner could consider optional trajectories that minimize\nmeteoroid, radiation, and charging exposure. The Juno\nmission is a case in point because the spacecraft trajectory\nwas selected to be highly eccentric and to pass over the\npoles in such a way that for much of the mission it avoids\nJupiter\u2019s intense radiation belts. Similarly, the Voyager and\nCassini trajectories were selected to pass through the gaps\nin the Saturnian rings to avoid particle impacts.\n\n3.4.8 Operational Procedures\n\nAs in careful trajectory selection, operational procedures\ncan significantly mitigate environmental effects. Specific\nprocedures can be simulated using a testbed and the effects\nof part, assembly, functional, and spacecraft subsystem\nfailures can be evaluated versus mission timeline. Fault tree\nanalyses can be used to develop fault protection software.\nVehicle operational procedures, such as orientation (say,\nrelative to the Sun for thermal protection), can be imple-\nmented to limit specific effects during certain mission\nphases. For example, Cassini was flown in a fixed orienta-\ntion during the cruise phase to provide a reduction in\nimpacts on its rocket nozzles by a factor of approximately\nfour. Finally, operational modes like hot (electronics \u2018on\u2019)\nversus cold (electronics \u2018off\u2019) and sparing can be used.\n\n3.4.9 Construction Methods\n\nProper construction methods are a clear necessity for high\nreliability and for preventing design failures. These go hand\nin hand with correct handling procedures (see ISO 9000\npractices for proper handling techniques). For complex space\nsystems, the engineer must be acutely aware of how the\nelectrical harnessing layout is constructed and the layout of\ngrounding wires as these can contribute to ground loops and\nEMC/EMI concerns. Construction techniques need to mini-\nmize/limit the contamination of sensors, optics, paints, and\ncoatings. A particularly dramatic example occurred for the\nfirst Shuttle tether experiment, on-board STS-75 in 1996. The\nelectrical conductor of the tether was a copper braid wound\naround a nylon string, encased in Teflon-like insulation, with\nan outer cover of kevlar. All of this was then placed inside a\nnylon sheath. Apparently during construction, in winding up\nthe tether on a spool, a wire filing was inadvertently forced\ninto the cable insulation. As the tether was deployed, the\nimperfection caused a short between the Shuttle and the\ntether causing an arc discharge that severed the tether.\n\n3.4.10 Interactions Versus Design Options\n\nGiven the various interactions and the design options\navailable, a correlation matrix can be constructed that\nrelates the appropriate effect with a means for mitigating\nthat effect. Table 3.6 is such a matrix and provides an\nexample of how the engineer might weight the comparative\nvalues of a design option versus specific interactions. Note\nthat a \u20183\u2019 represents a principal method for mitigating an\neffect and should be given careful consideration in mission\ndesign, whilst \u20181\u2019 represents a method with minor effect. In\nan actual case, a mission-specific assessment should be\nmade for the various spacecraft designs being evaluated.\n\n3.5 Design Factors\n\nThe final step in determining the proper mix of design\noptions and mitigating techniques for a given mission is to\nidentify mission-specific design factors that must be con-\nsidered by a project. While these factors, described in the\nfollowing, are straightforward, the project management\nmust carefully weigh their comparative value or impact on a\nspecific project\u2014they are not necessarily strictly engineer-\ning issues. As an example, the use of a radioisotope power\nsource demands a strong technical justification, and the\nmission must undergo the Nuclear Safety Launch Approval\nprocess. A project must carefully weigh the advantages of\nthe power source versus the additional costs of using it in\nlieu of a solar array.\n\n3 Space Environments and Survivability 55\n\n\n\n3.5.1 Cost\n\nThe most obvious mission factor to be considered is cost in\nits various forms. In evaluating every design trade, there are\ninevitably monetary costs to be compared. The monetary\ncosts are of course very dependent on the mission require-\nments and the class of the mission\u2014typically, the higher the\nrequired reliability of the mission (Class A being the highest,\nClass D or now E being the lowest), the higher the monetary\ncosts.\n\n3.5.2 Mass\n\nMost missions, because of launcher constraints, are driven by\nlimited mass requirements. Radiation shielding (Europa) or\nthe requirement for redundant systems (Pluto) would likely\ndrive mass requirements in the environmental effects arena.\n\n3.5.3 Power\n\nAlthough power requirements and the power source (say,\nsolar arrays versus radioisotope power sources) would be\nmajor issues for many programs, only the decision on\n\noperating voltage will likely have a direct impact on envi-\nronmental interactions. Many of the other design trades will\nbe affected but will likely not be as critical for the space\nenvironment effects considered.\n\n3.5.4 Complexity\n\nIncreased complexity may well be a major fallout from any\nenvironmental survivability trade. Key impacts would be in\nmore elaborate shielding design (both radiation for Europa\nand thermal protection for Solar Probe), careful positioning\n(placement of systems on Europa and Solar Probe would be\nparticularly constraining), special material selection (the\nSolar Probe heat shield), advanced EDAC software (the\nbeacon mode reliability), enhanced redundancy (Pluto), and\nelaborate circuit design (Europa radiation hardening).\n\n3.5.5 Reliability\n\nReliable operations over a decade or more (for example, the\nPluto New Horizons mission) or in extreme environments\n(like the harsh radiation environment at Europa) require\nspecial care in the areas of EDAC software, redundancy,\n\nTable 3.6 Design option space versus interactions, note assessment depends on spacecraft design\n\nInteractions Design options\n\nShielding Positioning Material\nproperties\n\nElectronic\nparts\n\nCircuit/\nsystem\ndesign\n\nGrounding Trajectory Operational\nprocedures\n\nConstruction\nmethods\n\nCumulative\nradiation\neffects\n\n3 3 2 3 3 3 1\n\nSingle event\nupsets\n\n2 1 3 3 2 2\n\nLatch-up 2 1 3 3 2 2\n\nSurface\ncharging/\nwakes\n\n3 3 3 1 3 3 3 2 3\n\nInternal\ncharging\n\n3 2 3 2 3 3 3 2 3\n\nPower loss 3 3 3 1\n\nV 9 B 2 3 2\n\nSurface\ndamage\n\n3 3 1\n\nContamination 3 3 3 2 2 3\n\nGlow 3 2 3 1\n\nParticle\nimpacts\n\n3 3 2 3\n\nTorques 3 3 2 3\n\nThermal 3 3 3 1 3\n\nA \u20183\u2019 represents a principal method for mitigation, whilst \u20181\u2019 represents a method with minor effect\n\n56 H. B. Garrett\n\n\n\nand parts hardness. Long-term reliability ultimately leads to\nthe need for a complete systems approach.\n\n3.5.6 Availability\n\nAvailability encompasses multiple issues. The first is the\nwell-known issue of parts or design availability\u2014can the\nnecessary parts or a usable design be found? The second\nissue is system availability to the operators\u2014if this design\nfix is employed, will it lead to increased down time? That is,\nif the spacecraft is required to point a certain way to avoid\nmeteoroid impacts would that limit the useful scientific data\nreceived?\n\n3.5.7 Usability\n\nIn the case of usability, after applying a particular design\ntrade, the designer should determine how it would influence\nthe ease of operation of the vehicle. Would the design fix\nmake it impossible to perform a certain series of operations?\nWould it rule out operations that might be critical to\nmeeting the mission requirements? Furthermore, the\ndesigner should consider whether it is desirable to allow a\nspacecraft to do something potentially harmful to itself, or\nwhether it is better to simply protect against this through\ndiligent operations procedures. The use of operations pro-\ncedures in place of physical limitations typically increases\nthe likelihood of recovery from non-nominal scenarios,\nhence increasing usability.\n\n3.5.8 Special Issues\n\nAlthough a catch-all, the primary \u2018special issues\u2019 being\nconsidered here are the politics of radioisotope power\nsupplies, their environmental issues, and the launch vehicle\nlimitations imposed by such programs. Other examples are\nmissions such as Europa and Pluto that place unique plan-\netary contamination requirements on the spacecraft that\nmay affect specific environmental design choices.\n\n3.5.9 Design Options Versus Design Factors\n\nGiven the various design options available, a correlation\nmatrix can be constructed that relates the design options and\nfactors. Table 3.7 compares the overall trade space or set of\ndesign options with the various factors assuming a repre-\nsentative mission set (Europa, Pluto, and Solar Probe). The\nspecific ratings provided are for a representative mission set\nwhere the major design factors would likely be radiation\n\nand meteoroid shielding (Europa), material development\n(Solar Probe heat shield), software development (for a long-\nterm autonomous beacon mode), redundancy (for the Pluto\nmission), parts hardness (Europa), and trajectory (all three\nmissions would require complex trajectory calculations).\n\n3.6 Designing for Survivability\n\nTo summarize, environmental interactions can have serious\nnegative consequences for a mission\u2019s survivability. Sys-\ntematic consideration of the available mitigation techniques\ncan limit these problems and lead to a much more reliable\nand often less expensive design. Tracing the pathway from\nenvironment to interaction to design options and then\nevaluating the options based on programmatic factors,\nhowever, can be an involved process. The rewards, though,\nshould be obvious\u2014a better-optimized design based on\ncost, mass, and reliability trades. At the least, by following\nsuch a process, the major space environment concerns can\nbe identified early in a program when mitigation can be\ndone relatively inexpensively. This chapter has provided a\nsystematic method for considering the many trade-offs that\nneed to be included. In particular, filling in Tables 3.2, 3.6,\nand 3.7 provides a formal means of carrying out a first-order\nevaluation of the \u2018tallest tent poles\u2019 in the optimization of a\nspacecraft design and provides a starting point for identi-\nfying the principal mitigation methods.\n\nTable 3.1 summarizes the overall procedure for carrying\nout an integrated spacecraft design to optimize survivability\nin the space environment. The principal point to take away\nis that the designer must consider all the possible environ-\nments of concern and their effects early in the design pro-\ncess. Failure to do this can significantly increase the cost\nand schedule in developing a viable mission concept\u2014it has\nbeen said that if finding and addressing an issue in the\ndesign phase costs one USD, addressing it in the con-\nstruction phase will cost ten USD, while addressing it\nduring launch preparations will cost 100 USD. Having to\naddress it during flight may mean loss of the mission.\n\n3.7 Suggested Resources for Space\nEnvironment and Survivability\n\nTo conclude this chapter, some of the main published\nresources that the reader should consider in developing a\nspace environment survivability evaluation of a spacecraft\nare listed below. These are primarily reference books aimed\nat summarizing the environments and their effects in broad\nterms. WIKIPEDIA and other online sites are also listed.\nUnfortunately, and fortunately, these latter sites are period-\nically updated and thus are subject to change. Of particular\n\n3 Space Environments and Survivability 57\n\n\n\nnote, however, are the Space Environments and Effects\nhomepage supported by NASA MSFC and the Space Envi-\nronment Information System (SPENVIS) website supported\nby ESA. These two sites provide access to key environment\nand interaction programs for actually computing the envi-\nronmental properties and their effects on space missions.\nFinally, the author strongly recommends that all environ-\nmental and survivability analyses start with a visit to your\norganization\u2019s Reliability Engineering professionals.\n\n3.7.1 Further Reading\n\n\u2022 Garrett, H.B., and C.P.

It was only realized as a practical\nfield within engineering in the middle of the 20th cen-\ntury, as discussed in Chap. 1, with the onset of the Space\nAge.\n\nA concise definition of \u2018astrodynamics\u2019 is important to\nensure sufficient distinction from related topics. Consider\nthat \u2018celestial mechanics\u2019 is a branch of astronomy con-\ncerned with the study of the motion of celestial objects,\n\u2018orbit dynamics\u2019 is concerned with the study of all orbiting\nbodies, and \u2018attitude dynamics\u2019 is concerned with the ori-\nentation of an object is space. Meanwhile from [1], astro-\ndynamics is defined as\n\nthe study of the motion of man-made objects in space subject to\nboth natural and artificially induced forces.\n\nThus, astrodynamics combines features of each of the\nrelated \u2018parent\u2019 fields of science, and through the addition of\n\u2018\u2018artificially induced forces\u2019\u2019 transposes these parent sci-\nences into the field of engineering.\n\n4.1 Introduction to Orbit Dynamics\n\nAn orbit is a geometric curve with no reference to time and\ncan be either open or closed. A trajectory is the sequence of\npoints in time along an orbit; the equations of motion of a\nbody thus propagate the initial conditions along a trajectory.\n\nThe trajectory of a celestial body will diverge from its\nnominal orbit due to perturbations not considered when\ndeveloping the nominal orbit.\n\n4.1.1 Kepler\u2019s Laws\n\nAristotle (384BC\u2013322 BC) taught that circular motion was\nthe only perfect motion. It followed therefore that this would\nbe the motion of all \u2018heavenly\u2019 bodies. However, the work of\na Danish nobleman, Tycho Brahe (1546\u20131601) and his\nassistant, the prematurely born son of a mercenary and a\nhealer later tried for witchcraft, were to change this thinking\nforever. Brahe is credited with making the most accurate\nastronomical observations of his time and it is from these\nobservations that his assistant would develop his own theo-\nries of \u2018heavenly\u2019 motion. In 1609, Brahe\u2019s assistant pub-\nlished his first two laws of planetary motion. A third followed\nin 1619, and with this Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630) had his\nthree laws of planetary motion. Kepler\u2019s laws are\n1. The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at a focus.\n2. The rate of description of area by the radius vector\n\njoining plant to the Sun is constant.\n3. The cubes of the semi-major axis of the orbit are pro-\n\nportional to the squares of the period of revolution.\nKepler\u2019s first law describes the shape of an orbit, while\n\nalso locating the central body. The second law tells how the\nangular velocity of a body changes with distance from\nthe central body as it progresses around its orbit, and that the\nangular velocity is greatest at periapsis and least at apoapsis.\nFinally, the third law relates the size of an orbit to the period\nof revolution. From Brahe\u2019s observations, Kepler\u2019s laws are\nexact. Today they remain highly accurate approximations for\nthe vast majority of natural celestial bodies and for spacecraft\nin weakly perturbed orbits. The term Keplerian motion is\nused to describe motion that exactly satisfies Kepler\u2019s laws,\nbut it should be noted that these laws are only a description\nof the motion, not an explanation.\n\nM.

One particular\nrelationship of note is Bode\u2019s Law (also called Titius\u2013Bode\nlaw), first published in 1772. This gives the mean distance\nfrom the Sun of each of the planets in our solar system as\n\nrn \u00bc 0:4\u00fe 0:3\u00f02n\u00de \u00f04:1\u00de\n\nwhere n takes the values -?, 0, 1, 2, 3, and so forth. When\npublished, Bode\u2019s law approximately satisfied all of the\nknown planets, with a gap between the fourth planet (Mars)\nand the fifth planet (Jupiter). Furthermore, when Uranus\nwas discovered in 1781 it was found to also satisfy Bode\u2019s\nlaw. Consequently, attention was drawn to the apparent gap\nbetween the fourth and fifth planets, and subsequently\nCeres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, was found at\nBode\u2019s predicted distance in 1801. Bode\u2019s law was widely\naccepted until the discovery of Neptune in 1846, which was\nfound not to conform to the law.\n\nThe exact explanation of the apparent accuracy of\nBode\u2019s law is unclear. Similar to Bode\u2019s law, a notable\nnumber of commensurabilities exist, both in our solar sys-\ntem and in other orbital systems. For example, a 1:2:4\nresonance in orbital period is exhibited by Jupiter\u2019s moons\nGanymede, Europa and Io. A second example of such an\norbital resonance, that is a 1:2:4 ratio, was confirmed in\n2010 in the extrasolar planets Gliese 876c, Gliese 876b and\nGliese 876d [2]. Once again, the exact explanation for such\ncommensurabilities remains unclear; a detailed discussion\nof some commensurabilities can be found in [3].\n\n4.1.3 The Two-Body Problem\n\nGiven at any time the positions and velocities of two\nmassive particles that are moving under their mutual grav-\nitational force alone, the mass of each being known, the\ntwo-body problem seeks to determine their positions and\nvelocities at any other time. This problem was first posed\nand solved by Isaac Newton (1642\u20131727). The two-body\nproblem is important because it is the only gravitational\nproblem in dynamics for which a complete and uncon-\nstrained general solution can be defined. Furthermore and as\nwith Kepler\u2019s laws, a wide range of practical orbital prob-\nlems can be approximated as two-body problems, providing\napproximate solutions to these problems.\n\n4.1.3.1 Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion\nProviding the explanation and physical rational for Kepler\u2019s\nlaws, Newton introduced his three laws of motion in his\n\n1687 manuscript, Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Math-\nematica, or simply Principia. These are\n1. Every body continues in its state of rest or uniform\n\nmotion in a straight line except in so far as that state is\ncompelled to change by forces impressed on it.\n\n2. The rate of change of momentum of a body is propor-\ntional to the impressed force and takes place in the\ndirection in which that force is impressed.\n\n3. To every action there is always an opposed equal reac-\ntion: or, mutual actions of two bodies upon each other\nare always equal and directed in contrary parts.\n\n4.1.3.2 Newton\u2019s Law of Universal Gravitation\nTogether with Newton\u2019s second law of motion, when\napplied to a constant-mass system, Newton\u2019s law of uni-\nversal gravitation provides the basis for celestial mechanics\nand astrodynamics. As with Newton\u2019s laws of motion,\nNewton\u2019s law of universal gravitation was introduced in\nPrincipia and can be stated as: Every particle of matter in\nthe universe attracts every other particle of matter with a\nforce directly proportional to the product of the masses and\ninversely proportional to the square of the distance between\nthem. Hence, for two particles of mass m1 and m2 separated\nby a distance r, the mutual force of attraction, F, is\n\nF \u00bc G m1m2\nr2\n\n\u00f04:2\u00de\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, often called the uni-\nversal gravitation constant. It should be noted that the\nuniversal gravitation constant is widely regarded as the\nmost difficult physical constant to accurately measure; the\n2010 Committee on Data for Science and Technology\n(CODATA) recommended value of the gravitational con-\nstant has a relative standard uncertainty of 1.2 9 10-4.\n\nSome problems do exist with Newton\u2019s law of universal\ngravitation. For example, as Newton himself noted the law\nrequires the force to act instantaneously, in a vacuum, and\nwithout the mediation of anything by or through which the\nforce could act; commonly referred to as \u2018action at a dis-\ntance\u2019. In many ways, Newton\u2019s law of universal gravita-\ntion has been superseded by Albert Einstein\u2018s (1879\u20131955)\ntheory of general relativity, which attributes gravity to\ncurved spacetime instead of a force propagated between two\nbodies. In general relativity masses distort nearby space-\ntime, with other particles thereby moving in trajectories\ndetermined by the geometry of spacetime. However, New-\nton\u2019s law of universal gravitation provides an excellent\napproximation for the effect of gravity in non-relativistic\nsituations and therefore remains of great value.\n\n4.1.3.3 Solution of the Two-Body Problem\nAssuming each of the two bodies are point masses and that\neach feels no force other than the mutual gravitational\n\n62 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\nattraction, the mutual force can be equated using Newton\u2019s\nthird law. Assuming an inertial reference frame and using\nNewton\u2019s second and universal gravitation laws it can be\nshown that the center of mass of the two-body system is at\nrest, or moves with constant velocity, forming a new inertial\nframe. Thereafter, the equations of motion of each mass can\nbe written as a single equation, the two-body equation of\nmotion\n\n\u20acr\u00fe l\nr3\n\nr \u00bc 0 \u00f04:3\u00de\n\nwhere l = G(m1 ? m2) is called the gravitational parame-\nter and r is the vector joining m1 and m2, as shown in\nFig. 4.1. Note that if m1 ? m2 then the gravitational\nparameter is typically written as l = Gm1; this is especially\nconvenient as l can be determined to a high degree of\naccuracy through trajectory observation, thereby negating\nthe low level of accuracy in knowledge of the universal\ngravitation constant.\n\nFrom Eq. 4.3 it can be shown that the total energy is\nconserved for the two-body problem, that the motion is in a\nplane normal to the angular momentum vector, and that the\nangular momentum of the system is conserved, with the\nangular momentum vector being twice the rate of descrip-\ntion of area by the radius vector. This final point is Kepler\u2019s\nsecond law in a mathematical form.\n\nThe two-body equation of motion, Eq. 4.3, can be solved\nto obtain the position of a particle as a function of its\nposition around the orbit, where position is used as the\nindependent variable in place of time. Solving for position\nyields\n\nr\u00f0h\u00de \u00bc h\n2=l\n\n1\u00fe Ah2=l\n? ?\n\ncos h\n\u00f04:4\u00de\n\nwhere A is a constant of integration and h is the orbit\nangular momentum. It should be apparent that Eq. 4.4 is the\npolar equation of a conic section and thus that all orbits are\nconic sections and may be better written as\n\nr \u00bc p\n1\u00fe e cos h \u00f04:5\u00de\n\nwhere p = h2/l = a(1 - e2) is the orbit semi-latus rectum,\ne = Ah2/l is the orbit eccentricity, and h is the orbit true\nanomaly, also often written as m in celestial mechanics lit-\nerature; each of which will be discussed later. The solution\nof the two-body problem, a conic section, provides a\nmathematical rational for Kepler\u2019s first law as a special case\nof the solution in which the orbit eccentricity is less than\none.\n\n4.1.3.4 Conic Sections\nConic sections are the curves generated by the intersection\nof a plane with one or two nappes of a cone. All orbits are\nconic sections as shown in Fig. 4.2. A plane that fully\nintersects only a single nappe produces an ellipse, eccen-\ntricity less than one; if the plane is perpendicular to the axis\nof the cone, it produces a circle, eccentricity equal to zero; a\nspecial case of the ellipse. Such orbits are closed periodic\nreturning orbits. If the plane does not fully intersect a single\nnappe it produces a parabola, eccentricity equal to one, and\nif it intersects both nappes it produces a hyperbola, eccen-\ntricity greater than one. Such orbits are open, non-returning\n(or escape) orbits.\n\n4.1.4 Basic Orbit Parameters\n\nAll conic sections have two focal points, or foci. In astro-\ndynamics the gravitational center of attraction sits at one\nfocus, termed the primary focus. In the special case of a\ncircular orbit the two foci are coincidental, while in a\nparabola orbit one focus is removed to infinity. As shown in\nFig. 4.2, the hyperbola has a branch associated with each\n\nFig. 4.1 Physical relationship between masses, with indicative center\nof mass shown\n\nFig. 4.2 Types of conic section with associated orbit eccentricity\nrange.

The case of two separate foci, as in an elliptical orbit\nis shown in Fig. 4.3.\n\nThe major and minor axes determine the size and shape\nof a conic section. Typically, half sizes are used and termed\nas such. Hence as shown in Fig. 4.3, the orbit size and shape\nis regulated by the semi-major axis, a, and semi-minor axis,\nb, where these are equal in the special case of a circular\norbit. The extreme points of an ellipse are the periapsis, or\npericentre, and apoapsis, or apocentre, the closest and fur-\nthest points of an orbit respectively. The terms periapsis and\napoapsis can be altered to indicate the central body at the\nprimary focus, for example in Earth orbit the terms become\nperigee and apogee, while in a solar orbit they become\nperihelion and aphelion. The location on an orbit is defined\nas the true anomaly, h, also often written as m in celestial\nmechanics literature, and is measured as the angular dis-\nplacement from the periapsis to the radius vector. The true\nanomaly varies from 0? to 360? and because it is measured\nfrom the periapsis is not defined for a circular orbit, where\ninstead the true or mean longitude can be used. From\nEq. 4.5, the radius of periapsis is found to be\n\nrp \u00bc a 1? e\u00f0 \u00de \u00f04:6\u00de\n\nwhilst the radius of apoapsis is\n\nra \u00bc a\u00f01\u00fe e\u00de: \u00f04:7\u00de\n\nThe shape of an orbit can be characterized by the single\nparameter eccentricity, e, which by definition is always\npositive and is defined as\n\ne \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\na2 ? b2\np\n\na\n: \u00f04:8\u00de\n\nCombining Eqs. 4.6 and 4.7 yields the further useful\nrelationships\n\na \u00bc ra \u00fe rp\n2\n\n\u00f04:9\u00de\n\nand\n\ne \u00bc ra ? rp\nra \u00fe rp\n\n: \u00f04:10\u00de\n\n4.1.4.1 Orbit Period\nFrom Eq. 4.3 recall that, in the mathematical form, Kepler\u2019s\nsecond law may be given as stating that the angular\nmomentum vector is twice the rate of description of area by\nthe radius vector, that is\n\nh \u00bc r2 _h: \u00f04:11\u00de\n\nFrom this, Kepler\u2019s third law can be given in the math-\nematical form by noting that the area of the ellipse to be\ncircumnavigated in time T is pab.

Thus\n\nV2 \u00bc _r2 \u00fe r2 _h2: \u00f04:15\u00de\n\nFrom Eqs. 4.5 and 4.11\n\nV2 \u00bc h\np\n\n? ?2\n2\u00fe 2e cos h? 1? e2\n\n? ?\t \n\n\n\u00bc 2h\n2\n\nrp\n? h\n\np\n\n? ?2\n1? e2\n? ?\n\n: \u00f04:16\u00de\n\nRecalling that p = h2/l = a(1 - e2), the traditional\nform of the vis-viva equation, also referred to as the orbital\nenergy conservation equation, can be written as\n\nV2 \u00bc l 2\nr\n? 1\n\na\n\n? ?\n: \u00f04:17\u00de\n\nIt is a simple matter to reduce Eq. 4.17 to find the\nvelocity on a circular orbit, where r = a, or to find the\nescape velocity, where a ? ?, for a minimum energy\nescape trajectory.\n\n4.1.4.3 Flight-Path Angle\nThe flight-path angle can be helpful in determining an\neffective cross-sectional area for use in perturbations anal-\nysis. The flight-path angle is measured from the local hor-\nizontal, defined as perpendicular to the radius vector, to the\nvelocity vector. As such, the flight-path angle is zero when\nthe orbit eccentricity is zero.\n\n4.1.4.4 Orbit Energy\nThe energy of an orbit is the sum of the kinetic and potential\nenergies of the orbiting bodies. If the two-body center of\nmass is not accelerating and assuming that m1 ? m2, then\nthe orbital energy of the larger body can be neglected and\nthe orbital energy, ET, can be defined in terms of the smaller\nbody alone as\n\nET \u00bc T \u00fe U \u00bc\nV2\n\n2\n? l\n\nr\n\u00f04:18\u00de\n\nwhere, T is the kinetic energy per unit mass. Using Eq. 4.17\nthe orbit energy thus reduces to\n\nET \u00bc ?\nl\n2a\n: \u00f04:19\u00de\n\nNote that the orbit energy is dependent on only the orbit\nsemi-major axis and that only a hyperbolic orbit has posi-\ntive orbit energy.\n\n4.1.4.5 Semi-Latus Rectum\nAs the eccentricity tends towards unity, the orbit energy\nincreases towards zero and the semi-major axis tends\ntowards infinity. At eccentricity equal to one, that is, on a\nparabolic orbit, the orbit energy is zero and the semi-major\naxis tends to infinity. For this reason, it is often convenient\nto use the semi-latus rectum, p, parameter to describe an\norbit because it remains defined for all eccentricity as\nillustrated in Fig. 4.3. The semi-latus rectum is the distance\nfrom the primary focus to the orbit, measured perpendicular\nto the line of apsis\n\np \u00bc h\n2\n\nl\n\u00bc b\n\n2\n\na\n\u00bc a 1? e2\n? ?\n\n: \u00f04:20\u00de\n\nNote that the semi-latus rectum is zero for all rectilinear\norbits.\n\n4.1.4.6 Rectilinear Orbit\nA rectilinear orbit is a limiting case of all orbits, where the\neccentricity is equal to one and occurs when the plane\nintersecting the cone is coincidental with the surface of the\ncone. In a rectilinear orbit, the radius of periapsis is zero\nsuch that, for example, a rectilinear ellipse becomes a line\nsegment connecting both foci, while a rectilinear parabola\nand a rectilinear hyperbola are each a line from the focus,\nalong the line apsis to infinity. In the rectilinear ellipse, the\nline is traversed with maximum velocity at one focus and\nzero velocity at the other, while in a rectilinear parabola\nmaximum velocity occurs at the focus, with velocity tend-\ning to zero as the radius tends to infinity. In a rectilinear\nhyperbola some velocity remains as the radius tends to\ninfinity.\n\n4.1.4.7 Kepler\u2019s Equation\nThe radius vector sweeps through 360?, 2p radians, in one\norbit period.

However, since the orbit exists\nwithin three-dimensional space, the location of the orbit\nplane must also therefore be defined; this complete set of\ninformation is termed the \u2018state\u2019 of the satellite in space and\nrequires six quantities to be fully defined. The \u2018state\u2019 of the\nsatellite can be defined in many ways, using different but\nequivalent forms that are called either a \u2018state vector\u2019, when\ncomprised solely of scalar magnitude terms, usually three\nposition and three velocity components, or an \u2018element set\u2019,\nwhen comprised of a set of geometric parameters, usually a\nmix of scalar magnitudes and angular representations. A\n\n\u2018state vector\u2019 or an \u2018element set\u2019 is always associated with a\nreference epoch, with time becoming, in effect, a seventh\nelement of the set and always referring to a particular ref-\nerence frame. It should be noted that time can also be used\nwithin the element set as the time of periapsis passage, but\nthis does not negate the requirement for a reference epoch to\ngive a position around the orbit.\n\nElement sets can take a number of forms due to the variety\nof orbital elements that can be used; the application domain\ntypically defines which set is most appropriate. The most\ncommonly used element set is called Classical Orbital Ele-\nments, also known as Keplerian Orbital Elements, and is\nillustrated in Fig. 4.5. The Classical Orbital Elements are\ndefined within an inertial rectangular frame of reference\ncentered at the primary focus with the X-axis directed\ntowards the zero point of longitude, also often called the First\nPoint in Aries even though, due to orbital precession, the\nvernal equinox is no longer within the constellation Aries.\nThe zero point of longitude is an arbitrary fiducial direction in\nthe reference plane at which right ascension, defined later in\nthis section, is zero. The zero point of longitude is often\ndefined as the northern vernal equinox in 1950 or 2000.\nHowever, as will be seen in Sect. 4.1.5 other fiducial direc-\ntions can be used. It should be carefully noted which fiducial\ndirection is used to define the zero point of longitude. The\nZ-axis is typically aligned positively along the spin axis of the\ncentral body towards the north pole. The frame of reference is\ncompleted in the right-hand sense by the Y-axis.\n\nDespite several problems with their use in orbit propa-\ngation, which will be discussed later, the Classical Orbital\nElements are very useful because they provide a direct\nrepresentation of the shape, size and orientation of an orbit,\nas illustrated in Fig. 4.5. The Classical Orbital Elements\nallow the orbit plane to be located in space through three\nangular parameters\n\u2022 X, the longitude, or right ascension of the ascending node\n\nmeasured from the X-axis to the ascending node, N, of the\norbit within the reference frame and in a right-handed\nsense.\n\n\u2022 x, the argument of periapsis measured from the ascend-\ning node, N, of the orbit to the periapsis of the orbit\nwithin the orbit plane and in a right-handed sense.\n\n\u2022 i, the inclination between the reference and orbit planes,\nmeasured from the reference plane in a right-handed\nsense. Note that inclinations \\90? are called prograde;\ninclinations [90? are called retrograde, and orbits with\ninclination =90? are called polar orbits.\nAlthough the semi-major axis, eccentricity, right ascen-\n\nsion of the ascending node, argument of periapsis and\ninclination serve to define the orbit, a sixth element is\nrequired to define a position on the orbit at a given epoch.\nThis sixth, position fixing element can be, amongst other\nthings, the true anomaly or the mean anomaly.\n\nFig. 4.4 Elliptic orbit parameters. Image Malcolm Macdonald\n\n66 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\nIt was noted earlier that the semi-major axis is ill-defined\nin certain circumstances, prompting the use of the semi-\nlatus rectum, and that the true anomaly is not defined for a\ncircular orbit. It should be further noted that the argument of\nperiapsis is also not defined for a circular orbit. Hence, the\nargument of latitude, u : x ? h, can be used in place of\nboth the true anomaly and the argument of periapsis and is\nmeasured from the ascending node to the position vector.\nSimilarly, the right ascension of the ascending node is not\ndefined for a zero inclination orbit. Hence, the true longi-\ntude, L, can be used to define the angle between the X-axis\nand the position vector. The classical orbital elements are\nsummarized in Table 4.1.\n\n4.1.5 Coordinate Systems\n\nThe use an inertial rectangular frame of reference was\ndiscussed in the previous section. Such a reference frame at\nEarth is termed an Earth Centered Inertial, ECI, or Geo-\ncentric Inertial, GCI, reference frame with the Z-axis\nmeeting the celestial sphere at the north celestial pole. This\nreference frame is also termed a Geocentric Equatorial\nCoordinate System, IJK. Note that at Earth the Z-axis, and\nhence the reference frame shown in Fig. 4.5, is angularly\ndisplaced from the plane of the ecliptic, the plane of the\nEarth\u2019s orbit around the Sun, through an angle known as the\nobliquity of the ecliptic, e, equal to approximately 23.4?. An\nequivalent reference frame centered at the Sun is termed a\nHeliocentric Inertial, HCI, reference frame, also called a\nHeliocentric Coordinate System, XYZ. The correct choice\nof reference frame can often significantly reduce the\n\ncomplexity of a problem; consider the motion of the planets\nin an Earth-centered and Sun-centered inertial frames.\n\nIn general, three types of coordinate system can be\nidentified in astrodynamics by consideration of the location\nof the origin of the system. Specifically, an object\u2019s center\nof mass, as in Fig. 4.5, the system\u2019s center of mass, or\nbarycenter, and a non-inertial rotating system using the\nbarycenter, called a synodic system.\n\n4.1.5.1 Position on Earth\nKnowledge of an observer\u2019s location on Earth is critical to\nmany problems in orbit dynamics, including accurately\nlocating a ground station, or for remote sensing of Earth.\nTwo coordinates, latitude and longitude define a location on\nthe surface of a planet. Longitude is an angular displace-\nment measured from a prime meridian. In the case of the\nEarth, it was proposed at the International Meridian Con-\nference, held in Washington, D.C., in the United States of\nAmerica, in 1884 that the prime meridian be, \u2018\u2018the meridian\npassing through the center of the transit instrument at the\nObservatory of Greenwich as the initial meridian for lon-\ngitude\u2019\u2019 [5]. This resolution passed 22\u20131, with San Domingo\n(now the Dominican Republic) voting against, and France\nand Brazil abstaining; the French did not adopt the Green-\nwich meridian until 1911. It was also proposed at the\nInternational Meridian Conference that \u2018\u2018longitude shall be\ncounted in two directions up to 180?, east longitude being\nplus and west longitude minus\u2019\u2019 [5]. This resolution was,\nhowever, rather controversial and provoked much discus-\nsion over the use of two directions rather than a single range\nfrom 0? to 360?. The Earth\u2019s axis of rotation is termed the\n\u2018poles\u2019 and the equator is the locus of points on the surface\n\nFig. 4.5 Keplerian orbit\nparameters. Image Malcolm\nMacdonald\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 67\n\n\n\ncreated by the perpendicular plane to the axis of rotation\npassing through the center of mass. The Earth\u2019s equatorial\nplane is the reference plane shown in Fig. 4.5 and extends\nout from the equator; it is also the reference plane for\nmeasuring latitude, measured north\u2013south from the refer-\nence plane with values from 0? to \u00b190?; positive is the\nnorthern hemisphere.\n\nWhilst a perfectly spherical Earth is often used to locate\nan observer on the surface, it is noted that the Earth is not a\nperfect sphere. However, such an assumption is sufficiently\naccurate for many initial studies. If a more accurate location\nis required, several models exist. In particular, for Earth a\nsimple ellipsoid model works well; specifically an oblate\nspheroid with the semi-major axis equal to the equatorial\nradius and semi-minor axis equal to the polar radius.\nHowever, note that in the case of the Moon a triaxial\nellipsoid representation works better. It should be apparent\nthat longitude is by definition, compliant with a non-\nspherical Earth, but this is not the case for latitude.\n\nThe reference ellipsoid provides an approximation to the\nhypothetical surface denoted as the mean sea level. The\nactual mean sea level surface (if the oceans were in\n\nTable 4.1 Definition of Classical Orbital Elements\n\nParameter Symbol Definition\n\nSemi-major axis a Half the major axis of an orbit\u2019s ellipse\n\nSemi-minor axis b Half the minor axis of an orbit\u2019s ellipse\n\nEccentric anomaly E cos?1 1e 1? ra\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\nEccentricity e\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\na2?b2\np\n\na\n\nInclination i Angle between the orbital plane and a reference plane\n\nEccentric longitude K - ?

Macdonald\n\n\n\nequilibrium, at rest relative to the rotating Earth) extended\nthrough the continents is called the geoid. The geoid devi-\nates from the reference ellipsoid due to the uneven distri-\nbution of mass within the Earth, as illustrated in Fig. 4.6. A\nplumb line taken from an observer\u2019s location on the surface\nof the Earth will in general not intersect the Earth\u2019s equa-\ntorial plane at the center of the Earth due to the variation of\nthe geoid from the reference ellipsoid. The plumb line will\nintersect the equatorial plane at an angle /, termed the\nastronomical latitude. A line joining the observer to the\ncenter of the Earth intersects the equatorial plane at an angle\n/, termed the geocentric latitude.\n\nThe non-spherical Earth introduces a third definition of\nlatitude, termed the geodetic latitude, u, which is the\nintersection angle of a line normal to the surface of the\nellipsoid with the equatorial plane. The latitude used on\nmost maps is the geodetic latitude. The difference between\nthe geodetic latitude and the astronomical latitude is typi-\ncally very small, but is non-negligible for high-accuracy\nobservations and is termed the \u2018station error\u2019 or \u2018deflection\nof the vertical\u2019. The geometry of these latitudes is illustrated\nin Fig. 4.7.\n\n4.1.5.2 Celestial Sphere\nThe celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere of arbitrary\nradius, which is concentric with the Earth and rotating upon\nthe same axis. It can often be convenient to suppose that\nobserved objects are simply located at fixed positions on the\ninside of this sphere, especially within astronomy when the\ndistance to an object is of no concern. Alternatively, it can\nbe supposed that objects move on the inner surface of the\n\nsphere. The celestial poles are located at the intersection of\nthe Earth\u2019s rotational axis with the celestial sphere. Great\ncircles are the intersection of the celestial sphere by a plane\npassing through the center of the sphere, while hour circles\nare great circles that include the axis of rotation, as shown\nin Fig. 4.5.\n\nThe location of an object on the celestial sphere is\ndescribed by two angular quantities. Similar to a position on\nEarth, this can be either the ecliptic (or celestial) latitude\nand longitude, which use the ecliptic as a reference plane\nand take the arbitrary fiducial direction as the First Point in\nAries, or alternatively right ascension and declination,\nwhich use the equatorial plane and take the arbitrary fiducial\ndirection as the vernal equinox at a given epoch. As illus-\ntrated in Fig. 4.5, right ascension, a, is measured positively\nfrom the fiducial direction to the east and within the refer-\nence plane, hence unlike longitude varies from 0? to 360?.\nDeclination, d, is measured from the reference plane posi-\ntive to the north and negative to the south and varies from\n0? to 90?. Hence, at Earth and on the celestial sphere the\ndeclination and terrestrial latitude are the same, but right\nascension and terrestrial longitude differ because they use\ndifferent fiducial directions.\n\n4.1.5.3 Supplementary Coordinate Systems\nIn addition to the Earth Centered Inertial (Geocentric\nInertial/Geocentric Equatorial Coordinate System) and the\nHeliocentric Inertial (Heliocentric Coordinate System),\nseveral other coordinate systems can be defined, such as the\nInternational Celestial Reference System, ICRS, a stan-\ndardized reference system adopted by the International\n\nFig. 4.7 Latitude geometry, not\nto scale. Image Malcolm\nMacdonald\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 69\n\n\n\nAstronomical Union (IAU) with origin at the solar system\nbarycenter. The primary fiducial direction of the ICRS\nframe is the IAU-76/FK5 (Fifth Catalog of Fundamental\nStars) value adopted for the quasar 3C 273,1 at the epoch\nJ2000.0 (defined in Sect. 4.1.6). Other useful coordinate\nsystems include the geocentric equivalent of the ICRS, the\nGeocentric Celestial Coordinate System, GCRF and the\nBody-Fixed Coordinate System, ITRF. Noting that a ref-\nerence frame with origin at the center of the Earth is called\ngeocentric, while a reference frame with origin on the\nEarth\u2019s surface is called topocentric, several other coordi-\nnate systems can be usefully defined. Topocentric systems\nwill typically make use of azimuth and elevation angles to\ndescribe the location of a body. Azimuth is the angle\nmeasured from the north, in a clockwise sense, to a point\nimmediately below the object of interest. Elevation is the\nangle measured from the local horizon upwards to the body\nof interest; as such, an object is only visible if it has an\nelevation of greater than zero. See [3, 4] for a detailed\ndescription of additional reference systems and conversions\nbetween systems and in terms of the celestial sphere.\n\n4.1.5.4 Satellite-Based Coordinate Systems\nA great number of satellite-based coordinate systems exist in\nthe literature, however little is standardized and often a sys-\ntem is developed to fill a requirement of a specific mission.\n\nPerhaps the most used satellite-based coordinate systems\nis the so-called Gaussian coordinate system or simply\n\u2018RTN\u2019 for radial, tangential and normal. The system can\nalso be referred to as a local vertical, local horizontal,\nLVLH, system and is illustrated in Fig. 4.8 as axis RSW.\nThe origin is located at the satellite with the radial vector\nalways pointing away from the central body along the\nradius vector towards the satellite; note that by this defini-\ntion the positive radial vector is zenith pointing and the\nnegative radial vector is nadir pointing. The W-axis is\ndirected along the cross, or vector product of the radius and\nvelocity vectors. The S-axis completes the system in a right-\nhanded sense. As such, the S-axis is only coincident with\nthe velocity vector for circular orbits, or at crossings of the\nline of Coordinate Systems.\n\nAn alternative satellite-based coordinate system is shown\nin Fig. 4.8 as axis NTW, here the T-axis is always tangential\nto the orbit and hence directed along the velocity vector.\nOnce again, the W-axis is directed along the cross, or vector\nproduct of the radius and velocity vectors. The N-axis\ncompletes the system in a right-handed sense. This system\n\nis useful to analyze changes in orbit velocity due to, for\nexample, atmospheric drag.\n\nThe third satellite-based coordinate system shown in\nFig. 4.8 is axis PQW. It is actually a rotated geocentric\nsystem, and is convenient for the processing of remote\nsensing data. The P-axis is directed towards the periapsis,\nthe Q-axis is perpendicular to the P-axis within the orbit\nplane and in the direction of orbit rotation. The W-axis\ncompletes the system in a right-handed sense. Further\nsatellite-based coordinate systems can be found in [4].\n\n4.1.5.5 Ground Track\nThe ground track, or trace, of a spacecraft is the locus of\npoints generated by the spacecraft position vector as it\nintersects the reference ellipsoid that provides an approxi-\nmation to the hypothetical surface denoted as the mean sea\nlevel. The ground track of three different orbits is shown in\nFig. 4.9; each of which will be discussed in Sect. 4.4. Note\nthat although Fig. 4.9 shows only closed orbits, that is\nellipses, a ground track can be derived for all spacecraft.\nFurthermore, in Fig. 4.9 the three orbits shown complete an\ninteger number of revolutions in a sidereal day (defined in\nSect. 4.1.6), causing the ground track to revisit the same\npath over the surface. In general, it is preferable for an Earth\norbiting spacecraft to complete an integer number of revo-\nlutions in an integer number of sidereal days, as this aids\nground management and operations of the spacecraft. For\nexample, European remote sensing spacecraft, including\nERS-1, ERS-2 and ENVISAT, are typically inserted into\norbits that repeat their ground tracks over a period of 35\nsidereal days, completing 501 revolutions in that time. If the\nspacecraft does not complete an integer number of revolu-\ntions in an integer number of sidereal days then the ground\ntrack will never repeat.\n\nInformation on the size, shape and inclination of an orbit\ncan be inferred directly from a ground track. For example,\nnote that the ground track of each orbit in Fig. 4.9 does not\nexceed a latitude magnitude equal to the orbit inclination.\nAdditionally, an orbit with a period of less than one sidereal\nday and of prograde inclination, i.e. \\90?, will predomi-\nnantly move from west to east along its ground track.\nBecause the ground track will move in the same direction as\nthe Earth\u2019s rotation, this is termed \u2018apparent direct\u2019, or\n\u2018apparent prograde\u2019 motion. In contrast an orbit with a\nperiod greater than one sidereal day and of prograde incli-\nnation will predominantly move from east to west along its\nground track. This is termed \u2018apparent retrograde\u2019 motion\nand results from the orbit moving over the surface of the\nEarth at an angular rate less than the rate of rotation of the\nEarth. The ground track of a retrograde orbit will always\nmove predominantly from east to west, irrespective of the\norbit period. Note further that due to variations in orbit\neccentricity and/or inclination, it is possible for the ground\n\n1 3C 273 was one of the first quasars discovered in the early 1960s,\nalongside 3C 48, and the first object to be identified as a quasi-stellar\nradio source, or \u2018\u2018quasar\u2019\u2019, a very energetic and distant active galactic\nnucleus. 3C 273 is the optically brightest quasar in our sky (apparent\nmagnitude, m * 12.9), and one of the closest with a redshift, z, of 0.158.\n\n70 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\ntrack to crossover itself and for the orbital motion to appear\ninverted, as shown in Fig. 4.9 for the Molniya orbit with a\nperiod of one half of one sidereal day.\n\nAs the semi-major axis of an orbit, and hence its period,\nis increased towards one sidereal day the apparent rotation\nof the ground track will compress longitudinally until the\nground track appears to repeat over a single portion of the\nEarth, when the orbit period is equal to the length of a\nsidereal day, the orbit is called geosynchronous. For an orbit\nperiod greater than one sidereal day, the apparent retrograde\nmotion is stretched by increasing the period.\n\n4.1.6 Time\n\nTime is used to accurately define the instant of an event; the\nmoment is referred to as an epoch, which designates the\nmoment as a date. All time systems count from a given\nepoch. The internationally accepted civilian calendar is the\nGregorian (or Christian) calendar, named after Pope Greg-\nory XIII, which counts years from the birth of Jesus of\nNazareth, a central figure of Christianity venerated as the\nson of God. It should be noted however that many other\ncalendars are also still used throughout the world, for\n\nFig. 4.8 Satellite-based\ncoordinate systems. Image\nMalcolm Macdonald\n\nFig. 4.9 Ground tracks of three\ndifferent orbits. Image Malcolm\nMacdonald\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 71\n\n\n\nexample in India the national calendar, or Saka calendar, is\nthe official civilian calendar, used alongside the Gregorian\ncalendar.\n\nThe Syst\u00e8me international d\u2019unit\u00e9s or, SI base unit of\nmeasurement of time is the second. One second is defined\nas the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation\ncorresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine\nlevels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom at rest\nat a temperature of 0 K. Larger units of time, such as the\nminute, hour or day are defined on this base unit.\nHowever, these are non-SI compliant because they are not\ndecimal and there is no fixed ratio between seconds and\nthese larger units owing to the requirement to occasionally\nintroduce leap second adjustments to the Coordinated\nUniversal Time (UTC) scale in order to keep it close to\nmean solar time.\n\n4.1.6.1 Sidereal Time\nThe time of successive crossings of an observer\u2019s meridian\nby an arbitrary fiducial direction in the reference plane is\none sidereal day. The local sidereal time, LST, is thus the\nhour angle of the vernal equinox and depends on the\nobserver\u2019s longitude. One 24 h period is 86,400 s and one\nsidereal day is approximately 86,164.1 s.\n\n4.1.6.2 Mean Solar Time\nEarth\u2019s orbit about the Sun is an ellipse, thus by Kepler\u2019s\nsecond law the time of successive crossings of an observer\u2019s\nmeridian by the Sun varies throughout the Earth\u2019s revolu-\ntion about the Sun. This variation is further compounded by\nthe fact that from the observer\u2019s location the path of the Sun\nis in the ecliptic plane, which is not coincident with the\nequatorial plane. To overcome this difficulty a fictitious\nmean Sun is introduced that has nearly uniform motion\nalong the celestial equator. The mean Sun increases its hour\nangle by 24 h in a sidereal day and thus the time interval of\nsuccessive crossings of an observer\u2019s meridian by the Mean\nSun is constant and termed a mean solar day. One mean\nsolar day is equal to approximately 85,928.8 s, which is less\nthan one sidereal day; however, the relationship is not a\nconstant ratio over a period of centuries due to the non-\nuniform rotation of the Earth.\n\nThe mean solar time is determined by measurements of\nthe Earth\u2019s orientation. The mean solar time at Greenwich\nis termed universal time (UT) and is distinct from\nGreenwich Mean Time (GMT) which is the apparent local\nsolar time at Greenwich. Universal time is found by\nreducing the observations of radio galaxies such as quasars\nfrom many observation locations, this is termed UT0. UT0\nis then corrected for polar motion such that time becomes\nindependent of the observer\u2019s location; this time is termed\nUT1.\n\n4.1.6.3 International Atomic Time\nOfficially introduced at the start of 1972, International\nAtomic Time (TAI, from the French name Temps Atomique\nInternational) is a high-precision time standard based on the\nSI definition of a second; that is, by counting the transitions\nof caesium-133 between two hyperfine levels. However,\nrelativistic effects, such as location, affect the rate of atomic\ntransitions. As such, TAI is determined as a weighted\naverage, including known correction factors, of over 200\natomic clocks from around the world to provide a unit of\ntime that is as close to the SI second as reasonably possible.\nAs such, TAI provides a measure of time independent of the\nmotion of the Earth or Sun.\n\n4.1.6.4 Coordinated Universal Time\nThe most commonly used time, Coordinated Universal\nTime (UTC, also referred to as Zulu time), is the principal\ntime standard by which world time is coordinated. UTC is\nbased on TAI, with leap seconds added at irregular intervals\nin order to maintain UTC within \u00b10.9 s of UT1. When\nintroduced in 1972, TAI was offset from UTC by 10 s. By\nthe end of 2013, 25 leap seconds had been introduced and\nhence TAI was offset from UTC by 35 s. For civilian pur-\nposes, local time is defined as offsets from UTC, creating\nthe time zones that are used today throughout the world.\n\nIt should be noted that the use of leap seconds is a matter\nof ongoing debate. In July 2005 the US proposed to the\nInternational Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service\n(IERS) to eliminate leap seconds from the UTC standard\nmaintained by the ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-\nR), part of the International Telecommunication Union\n(ITU). Discussion and resolution of this proposal has been\npostponed several times due to the controversial nature of\nthe proposal to decouple civilian time from solar time.\nResolution is due at the 2015 World Radio Conference.\n\n4.1.6.5 Julian Date\nIn the observation of a body, it is convenient to state the\nmoment of the observation as a decimal number of days\nfrom a given epoch. The Julian Date, JD, is the time,\nmeasured in days, from the epoch January 1, 4713 BC,\n1200 h (UT1); the reference epoch of the Julian period, a\nchronological interval of 7,980 years. The next Julian Per-\niod begins in the year 3268 AD. Note that the epoch is\ncounted from in the proleptic Julian calendar until October\n4, 1582, the last day of the Julian calendar, and thereafter\nthe Gregorian calendar, which started the next day as\nOctober 15, 1582 to account for the accumulated drift of the\nseasons through the year over the preceding thirteen cen-\nturies. Note that leap seconds are typically excluded from\nJulian Day calculations as they are not predictable with a\nsimple formula. The JD epoch is midday such that\n\n72 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\nastronomical observations, taken at night, can be made in a\nsingle Julian Day.\n\nThe value of JD is typically very large. Hence, the\nInternational Astronomical Union recommends the Modi-\nfied Julian Date (MJD), be used. The MDJ is taken from an\nepoch of November 17, 1858, 0000 h (UT1); note that MJD\nstarts at 0000 h, UT1, rather than 1,200 h. An alternatively\nused epoch is January 01, 2000, 1,200 h (UT1), and is\ntermed J2000.\n\n4.1.7 The Three-Body Problem\n\nThe many or n-body problem was first formulated by\nNewton and seeks, given at any time the positions and\nvelocities of three or more massive particles, the mass of\neach being known and which are moving under their mutual\ngravitational force alone, to determine the positions and\nvelocities at any other time. The complexity of this problem\nhas motivated study by many minds over the last three\ncenturies. It is probable that no general solution to this\nproblem is possible; yet the problem can be further com-\nplicated by taking into account the shape and internal\ncomposition of each body. Note however that several gen-\neral and useful assertions can be made on the n-body\nproblem; these assertions are expressed in the ten known\nintegrals of motion, see [3, 4] for further information on\nthese.\n\n4.1.7.1 Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem\nThe Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CRTBP),\nreduces the general three-body problem through two prin-\ncipal assumptions, specifically that two massive particles\nmove in circles about their center of mass, while attracting a\nthird infinitesimal mass to which they are not attracted. The\norbits and masses of each of the massive particles being\nknown, the problem is reduced to determining the extent of\nthe possible motion of the third particle. This simplification\nsignificantly reduces the order of the problem, whilst pro-\nviding a good approximation to many problems within as-\ntrodynamics, such as the motion of a spacecraft in the\nvicinity of both the Earth and the Moon. It should be noted\nthat although the assumption of circular motion by the\nmassive particles can be removed, to form the Elliptic\nRestricted Three-Body Problem (ERTBP), this problem is\nsignificantly more complex and often not required within\nflight dynamics.\n\nUsing a synodic reference system the CRTBP is illus-\ntrated in Fig. 4.10. The unit of distance between the primary\nparticles, denoted R, is chosen to be one. Similarly, the unit\nof time is chosen such that the gravitational constant, G, is\nalso one and the total mass of the system, M, is set equal to\none. From Fig. 4.10 it is seen that the system rotates about\n\nits center of mass, M, with an angular velocity\n\nx \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nGM=R3\n\np\n\u00bc 1. The total mass of the system is\n\nM = (m1 ? m2), whilst the mass ratio l = m2/(m1 ? m2),\nwhere l? 1=2 and m1 (= (1 - l)M) is generally greater than\nm2 (= lM). Note that as such m1 is located at -l on the X-\naxis, while m2 is located at (1 - l) on the X-axis.

Thereafter for v = 0, if r1 and r2\nare large then the reciprocal of r1 and r2 is small and\nC * (x2 ? y2), the equation of a circle. However, if r1 and r2\nare small then the reciprocal of r1 and r2 is large and\nC * 2(1 - l)/r1 ? 2l/r2, giving small oval curves about\nm1 and m2. As the Jacobi constant is a function of the initial\nposition and velocity of the infinitesimal mass it is seen that\nas initial velocity is increased, the Jacobi constant will\ndecrease, allowing the infinitesimal mass to access larger\nregions of space until eventually it can cross from m1 to m2,\nand then escape from m1 and m2.\n\n4.1.7.3 Lagrange Points\nAlthough no closed-form solution of Eqs. 4.25\u20134.27 exists,\nfive equilibrium points, termed Lagrange points, can be\nderived using these equations together with the Jacobi\nintegral. Specifically, the Lagrange points are double points\nwhere the partial derivate of the integral disappears. Joseph-\nLouis Lagrange [born Giuseppe Luigi Lagrancia,\n1736\u20131813)] showed that the required conditions for these\nequilibrium points are\n1. The resultant force on each mass passes through the\n\ncenter of mass of the system.\n2. This resultant force is directly proportional to the dis-\n\ntance of each mass from the center of mass.\n\n3. The initial velocity vectors are proportional in magni-\ntude to the respective distances of the particles from the\ncenter of mass, and make equal angles with the radius\nvectors to the particles from the center of mass.\nMathematically, in equilibrium the potential defined in\n\nEq. 4.28 must equal zero. Thus considering\n\noU\n\nox\n\u00bc x? 1? l\u00f0 \u00de x\u00fe l\u00f0 \u00de\n\nr31\n? l x? 1? l\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\n\nr32\n\u00bc 0 \u00f04:34\u00de\n\noU\n\noy\n\u00bc 1? 1? l\n\nr31\n\u00fe l\n\nr32\n\n? ?\ny \u00bc 0 \u00f04:35\u00de\n\noU\n\noz\n\u00bc ? 1? l\n\nr31\n\u00fe l\n\nr32\n\n? ?\nz \u00bc 0 \u00f04:36\u00de\n\nit is immediately apparent that for equilibrium solutions\nz must equal zero; in other words, the Lagrange points exist\nonly within the plane of motion of the two massive parti-\ncles. Similarly, if qU/qx = qU/qy = 0, then r1 and r2 must\nboth equal one. This defines the two equilateral equilibrium\npoints, L4 and L5, both of which can be shown to be stable.\nIn addition to the stable L4 and L5 points, three collinear\nsaddle points, L1, L2 and L3, can be found on the X-axis; see\n[3, 4] for a full derivation of these.\n\nContours of Jacobi constant, C, for two systems with\ndifferent mass ratio are shown in Fig. 4.11. Note when\nl = 0.5, the limiting case, the contours are completely\nsymmetrical, whilst when l = 0.1 the contours are distorted\nto reflect the relative mass distribution of the system.\nFigure 4.11 also shows the locations of each of the\nLagrange points. Note how the contours of Jacobi constant\nare distorted, whilst the L4 and L5 points remain equilateral.\nThe contours of Jacobi constant also give a clear illustration\nof the saddle equilibrium points L1, L2 and L3.\n\nFig. 4.10 Circular restricted\nthree-body problem geometry.\nImage Malcolm Macdonald\n\n74 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\n4.2 Perturbation Techniques\n\nMotion described by laws such as those of Kepler and\nNewton are idealized approximations of truth that is based\non macroscopic observations, such as those of Tycho Brahe.\nAs already stated, the term Keplerian motion is used to\ndescribe motion that exactly satisfies Kepler\u2019s laws, but\nsuch motion is (virtually) impossible to observe in natural\ncelestial bodies due to perturbing forces. That is, micro-\nscopic observations show deviations from the macroscopic;\nperturbation techniques are used to understand such devia-\ntions as well as to allow accurate predictions for the motion\nof a celestial body or a spacecraft.\n\nA notable historic example of the use perturbation\ntechniques was the work in the second quarter of the 19th\ncentury by European astronomers to locate the then undis-\ncovered planet Neptune. Based on observed deviations in\nthe orbit of Uranus from published astronomical tables it\nwas hypothesized that an unknown body was causing a\ngravitational perturbation on the orbit of Uranus. Based on\nthis hypothesis John Couch Adams (1819\u20131892) and Urbain\nLe Verrier (1811\u20131877) developed calculations as to the\nlikely location of the body that was causing the gravitational\nperturbation. Neither Adams nor Le Verrier were able to\nmuster significant interest from the astronomical commu-\nnity for these predictions. However, following a letter from\nLe Verrier to Berlin Observatory, Neptune was formally\ndiscovered on September 23, 1846 within 1? of where Le\nVerrier had predicted. It is interesting to note that Cam-\nbridge Observatory, on the request of Adams, had actually\nobserved and recorded Neptune twice in the month pre-\nceding its formal discovery, yet due to an overly casual\napproach had failed to recognize what was being observed\nand hence failed to make the formal discovery. It is also of\nnote that Galileo Galilei (1564\u20131642) observed and recor-\nded the position of Neptune in December 1612 and January\n1613, but as it had just turned \u2018apparent retrograde\u2019 its\n\nmotion was only very slight against the celestial sphere and\nhence not noted by Galileo.\n\nPerturbation techniques are subdivided into two branches\ntermed \u2018special perturbations\u2019, the primary focus of this sec-\ntion, and \u2018general perturbations\u2019. General perturbations tech-\nniques seek to solve the general differential equations of\nmotion, for a certain scenario, in algebraic and/or trigono-\nmetric form over a certain time interval and any variation from\nthis is assumed to be slow. Conversely, special perturbations\ntechniques solve the equations of motion, including all nec-\nessary perturbations, using direct numerical integration and\nare, in theory, not time limited. Note that results from general\nperturbations are often incorporated into special perturbations\nsolutions to account for specific disturbing forces.\n\nSpecial perturbation techniques allow the state vector, or\nelement set, of a body at a given epoch to be propagated over a\nshort time interval, accounting for all the forces on the body\nduring this interval, using the equations of motion. This cal-\nculation can be performed by a variety of methods, enabling\nthe new positions and velocities at the end of the time interval\nto be found. A second computation using the new positions\nand velocities enables the process to be carried forward\nthrough another time interval. Each computation is called a\nstep and, in theory, the numerical integration can be continued\nas long as desired. However, in reality rounding errors are\nintroduced and the accuracy of any calculation decreases with\nevery step. A potential (partial) solution to this error is to work\nwith more significant figures than required, such that the final\nrounding error does not influence the calculation when roun-\nded to the required number of significant figures. Additionally,\nthe error can be further alleviated by the use of as large a time\nstep as possible during each calculation step, thus minimizing\nthe number of occasions on which the solution is rounded. This\nerror source hints at a further drawback of special perturba-\ntions techniques, specifically that the state vector must be\ndetermined at multiple locations along the trajectory even if\nonly the final condition is desired.\n\nFig. 4.11 Contours of Jacobi\nconstant with Lagrange points\nillustrated for mass ratios, l, of\n0.5 (left) and 0.1 (right); units are\nnon-dimensional. Image\nMalcolm Macdonald\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 75\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Cowell\u2019s Method\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward method of determining the\nposition and velocity of a body is to directly integrate the\nequations of motion in rectangular coordinates as first per-\nformed for a space body in 1908 by Philip Herbett Cowell\n(1870\u20131949) and Andrew Clause de la Cherois Crommelin\n(1865\u20131935) [6, 7]. The integration formulas used by\nCowell and Crommelin were actually first given by Carl\nFriedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855). Cowell and Crommelin for-\nmulated their equations in rectangular coordinates using\nEq. 4.43. Specifically\n\n\u20acr\u00fe l\nr3\n\nr \u00bc F \u00f04:37\u00de\n\nwhere F is a disturbing acceleration. Note that this can also\nbe written as\n\n\u20acr \u00bc r\u00f0U \u00fe F\u00de \u00f04:38\u00de\n\nwhere F is a disturbing potential. The equations of motion\nare then integrated numerically by means of a multi-step\nalgorithm. Since the publication of the paper by Cowell and\nCrommelin the use of the term Cowell\u2019s method has\nbecome ambiguous. In numerical analysis texts \u2018Cowell-\ntype methods\u2019 refer to multi-step algorithms similar to those\nused in the original paper [3]. However, in celestial\nmechanics the term \u2018Cowell\u2019s method\u2019 often refers to the\nformulation of the equations in a rectangular coordinate\nsystem and the subsequent integration using any technique\nwhatsoever, for example by Runge\u2013Kutta formulas [3, 8, 9].\nThis would perhaps more correctly be termed \u2018Cowell\u2019s\nformulation\u2019. Such a method is good for scenarios where the\ndisturbing force or acceleration is of the same or higher\norder as that due to the central body, as the method does not\ndistinguish between the two. This however is also the pri-\nmary disadvantage, because a large number of significant\nfigures have to be carried due to the large central force term,\nrequiring many more time steps when the disturbing force\nor acceleration is small, otherwise a significant loss of\naccuracy occurs.\n\n4.2.2 Encke\u2019s Method\n\nIf only the differential accelerations are integrated, rather\nthan the total acceleration, considerable accuracy can be\nobtained with a larger time interval when the disturbing\nforce or acceleration is small. This method is known as\nEncke\u2019s Method, after Johann Franz Encke (1791\u20131865)\nbut it was actually first proposed by George Phillips Bond\n(1825\u20131865) and William Cranch Bond (1789\u20131859) of\nHarvard University in 1849, 2 years before Encke\u2019s work\nbecame known [3, 8, 9]. As already shown, to a first\n\napproximation an orbit is a conic section, this assumption\nis at the nucleus of Encke\u2019s method. Integrating the dif-\nference between the primary acceleration and the perturb-\ning acceleration implies a reference orbit must be\nemployed, along which the body would move in the\nabsence of any perturbations. The integration gives the\ndifference between the real coordinates and the conic\nsection coordinates. The conic section orbit is an osculating\norbit, thus at the epoch of osculation the differences vanish.\nAs time from the initial epoch increases so the difference\nbetween the real coordinates and the conic section coor-\ndinates increases, until it becomes necessary to derive a\nnew osculating orbit. If a new osculating orbit is not\nderived the various accelerations will grow in magnitude\nand the process becomes cumbersome. The process of\nselecting a new conic section from which to calculate\ndeviations is called \u2018rectification of the orbit\u2019. Following\nrectification of the orbit the initial conditions for the\ndeviation vector differential equation are again zero and the\nonly non-zero acceleration is the disturbing acceleration.\nThe error in determining the position and velocity of the\nosculating orbit is subject only to round-off errors and is\nindependent of the integration technique used. The accu-\nracy of calculation of the deviation from the osculating\norbit is limited by both round-off and truncation errors. The\nintegrated quantities are small with respect to the osculat-\ning quantities and have little effect on the determination of\nthe true orbit because before the errors become significant\na new osculating orbit is selected through the process of\nrectification. The main advantage of Encke\u2019s method is the\nlarger integration intervals that can be adopted compared to\nCowell\u2019s method. However, the computational cost of a\nsingle Encke integration step is much greater than that of a\nCowell step. The greater computational cost per step is\ntypically more than compensated for by the larger step\nsize. Encke\u2019s method has many applications, for example\norbit determination of highly eccentric comets, such as the\nanalysis performed by Encke on a comet later named after\nhim. The method can also be used to analyze orbits in\nEarth\u2013Moon space, where the Moon is taken as a per-\nturbing body.\n\nIt has been shown that in propagating a near-Earth\nsatellite the inclusion of the first-order effects of Earth\noblateness, see Sect. 4.3, in the reference orbit greatly\nimproves Encke\u2019s method by increasing both the interval\nbetween rectifications of the reference orbit and the accu-\nracy of the integration compared with the classic form of\nEncke\u2019s method [10]. It has also been shown that the cal-\nculation time for the integration of the motion of four or\nmore bodies can be reduced by an order of magnitude by\ncomparison to the original Encke method if the reference\norbit is taken to be a combination of several Keplerian\norbits [11]. It is thus clear that the Encke method is\n\n76 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\noptimized when the reference orbit is known and remains\nvery close to the real evolving orbit for a significant period.\n\n4.2.3 Variation of Parameters\n\nInitially, variation of parameters may appear more prob-\nlematical to implement than Encke\u2019s method, however it\nhas some advantages when the perturbing acceleration is\nquite small. One of the primary differences is that the Encke\nreference orbit is constant until rectification occurs, whereas\nin variation of parameters the reference orbit is continu-\nously changing and may thus be regarded as a form of\nEncke\u2019s method.\n\nThe variation of parameters equations of motion are a\nsystem of first-order differential equations that describe the\nrate of change for the time-varying elements. It is from this\nthat the method of variation of parameters gets its alterna-\ntive name of \u2018variation of orbital elements\u2019, or the slightly\nparadoxical \u2018variation of constants\u2019. In 1782, Lagrange\ncompletely developed for the first time the method of var-\niation of parameters while studying the elliptical motion of\ncomets. In doing so, Lagrange developed the variational\nequations of the motion of the classical orbit elements\nillustrated in Fig. 4.8. The equations of motion are termed\nLagrange\u2019s planetary equations, the derivation of which\ncan be widely found within the literature; see, for example,\n[3, 4, 9].\n\nLagrange\u2019s variational equations can either be derived\nfor the special case in which the disturbing acceleration is\nrepresented as the gradient of the disturbing function, or\nthey can be derived appropriate to the various choices of\ncomponent resolutions of the disturbing acceleration vector\nin the Gaussian, or RTN satellite-based coordinate system;\nillustrated in Fig. 4.8 as axis RSW. This form of the equa-\ntions of motion is attributed to Gauss\n\nda\n\ndt\n\u00bc 2a\n\n2\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\nlp\np R T N\u00bd ?\n\ne sin h\n1\u00fe e cos h\u00f0 \u00de\n\n0\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 \u00f04:39\u00de\n\nde\n\ndt\n\u00bc\n\nffiffiffi\np\n\nl\n\nr\nR T N\u00bd ?\n\nsin h\ncos h\u00fe cos E\n\n0\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 \u00f04:40\u00de\n\ndi\n\ndt\n\u00bc rffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\nlp\np R T N\u00bd ?\n\n0\n0\n\ncos h\u00fe x\u00f0 \u00de\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 \u00f04:41\u00de\n\ndX\ndt\n\u00bc rffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\nlp\np R T N\u00bd ?\n\n0\n0\n\nsin h\u00fex\u00f0 \u00de\nsin i\n\n? ?\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 \u00f04:42\u00de\n\ndx\ndt\n\u00bc 1ffiffiffi\n\nl\np R T N\u00bd ?\n\n?\nffiffi\np\np\n\ne cos h\n\n1\u00fe rp\n? ? ffiffi\n\np\np\n\ne sin h\n\n? rffiffipp cot i sin h\u00fe x\u00f0 \u00de\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775: \u00f04:43\u00de\n\nEquations 4.39\u20134.43 can be used to propagate a trajec-\ntory with the inclusion of a sixth position-fixing element.\nThe sixth element could be, amongst other things, the\neccentric anomaly, mean anomaly, true longitude, or as\nshown in Eq. 4.44, the true anomaly\n\ndh\ndt\n\u00bc\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\nlp\np\n\nr2\nepl\n\nepl\u00fe r2 ?pR cos h\u00fe p\u00fe r\u00f0 \u00deT sin h\u00f0 \u00de \u00f04:44\u00de\n\nwhich reduces to Eq. 4.11 in the absence of any perturbing\nforces.\n\nLagrange\u2019s planetary equations in the Gaussian form can\nbe analytically integrated, as in the method of general\nperturbations, or they can be integrated numerically step-\nby-step, with the new elements at the end of each step being\nused as the basis for the computation of the next step. Since\nLagrange first introduced his planetary equations, where the\nrates of change of the osculating elements of a planet\u2019s orbit\nare given in terms of the elements of that planet and of the\nplanets disturbing its heliocentric orbit, various attempts\nhave been made to overcome some of the serious problems\nassociated with the method. Some of the advantages of the\nvariation of parameters method are that it is strictly a per-\nturbation method and as such bypasses the central-body\nacceleration. For moderate perturbations, the differentials of\nthe elements are small and as such a larger step size can be\nused than in a rectangular coordinate method in which the\ncentral-body acceleration must be calculated each step.\nAmong the perceived disadvantages of the method is the\nmore complicated nature of the right-hand side of the\nequations compared to those of the rectangular coordinates\nequations of motion, including the presence of sine and\ncosine terms. Additionally, the traditionally perceived dis-\nadvantages are the need to solve Kepler\u2019s equation, the\nbreak-down of the equations when orbit eccentricity is zero\nor one, or orbit inclination is zero, and the fact that the\nequations are usually given in elliptical elements and are\nthus inapplicable to parabolic, hyperbolic or rectilinear\norbits. The disadvantages regarding computational diffi-\nculties offset some of the benefits of a larger time step than\na Cowell type solution. However, such issues can be min-\nimized with modern computing capabilities and prudent\nprogramming.\n\nIt was noted previously that the classic orbit elements are\nill-defined in certain circumstances. This presents several\nsignificant difficulties when attempting to propagate a tra-\njectory in these regions using the Gaussian form of\nLagrange\u2019s planetary equations. For example, as the orbit\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 77\n\n\n\neccentricity drops towards zero the rate of change of the\napses becomes indeterminable, see Eq. 4.43. Similarly, as\nthe inclination drops to zero the rate of change of the\nascending node becomes indeterminable, see Eq. 4.42. The\nobvious solution is thus to define the orbit through a change\nin variables, which can be done simply by using the true\nlongitude or argument of latitude as previously mentioned.\nAlternatively, this can be done by, for example, noting\nsymmetries to apply standard transformations to make a\nchange of variable from Keplerian to Delaunay variables\n[12].\n\n4.2.3.1 Non-singular Elements and the Equations\nof Motion\n\nTo derive variational equations that are non-singular,\ncombinations of the classical elements that do not depend\non either the line of nodes or the apsidal line are sought.\nAdding the variational equations for X and x, given in\nEqs. 4.42 and 4.43, eliminates the singularity at zero\ninclination\n\nd-\ndt\n\u00bc 1\n\nnabe\nR T N\u00bd ?\n\n?p cos h\np\u00fe r\u00f0 \u00de sin h\n\ner sin h\u00fe x\u00f0 \u00de tan i2\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5: \u00f04:45\u00de\n\nNoting that\n\ndM\n\ndt\n\u00bc n\u00fe 1\n\na2en\nR T N\u00bd ?\n\np cos h? 2re\n? p\u00fe r\u00f0 \u00de sin h\n\n0\n\n2\n4\n\n3\n5 \u00f04:46\u00de\n\nthe variational equations for - and M can thus be added to\nobtain an equation that also removes the singularity due to\nzero eccentricity\n\ndl\n\ndt\n\u00bc n\u00fe 1\n\nn\nR T N\u00bd ?\n\n? ep cos hb a\u00feb\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 2ra2\n? ?\n\ne p\u00fer\u00f0 \u00de sin h\nb a\u00feb\u00f0 \u00de\n\n? ?\n\nr sin x\u00feh\u00f0 \u00de tan i=2\u00f0 \u00de\nab\n\n? ?\n\n2\n6664\n\n3\n7775: \u00f04:47\u00de\n\nAs Eq. 4.47 is a function of the true anomaly, which is\nreferenced to periapsis, further development is required.\nKepler\u2019s equation can be written in the augmented form of\n\nl \u00bc-\u00feM \u00bc -\u00fe E ? e sin E\n\u00bc -\u00fe E\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe e sin - cos -\u00fe E\u00f0 \u00de ? e cos - sin -\u00fe h\u00f0 \u00de:\n\n\u00f04:48\u00de\n\nNote that the orbit radius may be written as\n\nr \u00bc a 1? e sin - sin K ? e cos - cos K\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00bc p\n1\u00fe e sin - sin L\u00fe e cos - cos L :\n\n\u00f04:49\u00de\n\nFrom Kepler\u2019s equation, Eq. 4.48, and the equation of an\norbit, Eq. 4.49, note that the eccentricity equivalent term\nand the longitude of periapsis equivalent term only appear\nin the combinations e sin - and e cos -.

He used i rather than i/2, but the inclusion of the\nhalf-angle simplifies the resulting Gaussian equations of\nmotion and allows the use of Allan\u2019s expansion of the\ngeopotential, if desired [13].\n\n4.2.3.2 Modified Equinoctial Elements\nEmploying a \u2018fast variable\u2019 (phase angle) as the sixth or\nposition-fixing element allows a regular perturbation tech-\nnique to be used, with the fast variable as the independent\nvariable. It thus becomes logical to modify the equinoctial\nelements by choosing true longitude in place of mean\nanomaly as the position-fixing element. Furthermore, by\nreplacing the semi-major axis with the semi-latus rectum a\nset of orbit elements that are non-singular for all orbits\nexcluding i = p is obtained; however this singularity can be\nhandled by appropriate definition of a \u2018retrograde factor\u2019.\nThe \u2018modified equinoctial elements\u2019 are thus defined as\n\np \u00bc a 1? e2\n? ?\n\n\u00f04:20\u00de\n\nf \u00bc e cos x\u00fe X\u00f0 \u00de \u00f04:50\u00de\n\ng \u00bc e sin x\u00fe X\u00f0 \u00de \u00f04:51\u00de\n\nh \u00bc tan i\n2\n\ncos X \u00f04:52\u00de\n\nk \u00bc tan i\n2\n\nsin X \u00f04:53\u00de\n\nL \u00bc X\u00fe x\u00fe h \u00bc -\u00fe h: \u00f04:54\u00de\n\nThe auxiliary (positive) variables are\n\ns2 \u00bc 1\u00fe h2 \u00fe k2 \u00f04:55\u00de\n\nw \u00bc 1\u00fe f cos L\u00fe g sin L \u00f04:56\u00de\n\nr \u00bc p\nw\n\n\u00f04:57\u00de\n\ns \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nh2 \u00fe k2\n\np\n\u00f04:58\u00de\n\n78 M.

However, the true longitude can only be\ndefined to within a multiple of 2p and thus the reference\nepoch must be known in order to resolve its actual value.\n\n4.2.4 Numerical Integration\n\nNumerical integration methods can be divided into either\nthe single-step or multi-step. The difference between these\ntwo methods is well illustrated in [3]. However, the dif-\nference can be summarized by noting that a single-step\nmethod is a self-starting method that only uses data from\nthe beginning of the current step in the calculation of the\nvariable values at the end of the step. Furthermore,\nchanging the step-size to match a defined error criterion\nposes no difficulties, easily allowing the interval step-size\nto be halved or doubled. The primary difficulty with a\nsingle-step method is that if the equations are non-linear,\nsuch as Lagrange\u2019s planetary equation of motion, then it\nmay become a time-consuming and unwieldy process to\ncalculate the higher-order terms of the expansion. A multi-\nstep method allows larger interval step-sizes to be adopted\neven when the higher-order terms of the expansion are\ncalculated. However, the law of diminishing returns sets in.\nFurthermore, stability considerations mean that it is wise to\nkeep the order below double figures. A multi-step proce-\ndure involves fewer computations than a single-step\nmethod, correct to the same order, subject to the constraint\nof not being self-starting and that special procedures are\nrequired to half or double the step-size. Therefore, mul-\nti-step methods are best suited to scenarios where the\nstep-size changes can be removed or minimized, such as\nalmost circular orbits, or when the equations have been\nregularized.\n\n4.2.4.1 Errors\nIt can be shown that the probable error of a double integral\nis 0.1124n3/2, where n is the number of integration steps\n[14]. That is to say, after numerically integrating the sec-\nond-order (x, y, z) equations of motion, Eq. 4.37, through\n100 steps there is an even odds chance that the rounding\nerror is smaller than 112.4 in units of the last decimal [3].\nFurthermore, the mean error of the osculating elements of a\nbody obtained by numerically integrating the Lagrange\nplanetary equations, which are first-order, will be propor-\ntional to n1/2, apart from the mean orbital longitude (or\nwhatever position fixing element is selected) in which case\nthe mean error is again proportional to n3/2 as this is a result\nof a double integral [14].\n\n4.3 Disturbing Force\n\nThe nature of the disturbing force that acts to cause devi-\nation from the macroscopic truths observed by Kepler in\nTycho Brahe\u2019s observations is varied and diverse. It should\nalso be noted that deviation from the laws of motion derived\nby Kepler and Newton cannot at all times be ignored in the\npreliminary mission design stage as this deviation may\nactually be key to enabling the mission concept, as will be\ndiscussed in Sect. 4.4.\n\n4.3.1 Additional Gravitational Fields\n\nIncorporating the effects of the gravitational attraction of a\nmassive particle, that is, other than the primary body, can be\nachieved by formulating the problem in rectangular coor-\ndinates. In doing so the force F of n additional massive\nparticles on the massless particle, that is, a spacecraft\nlocated at radius r, can be expressed as\n\nF \u00bc G\nXn\n\nj\n\nmj\nrj ? r\nrj ? r\n?? ??3 ?\n\nrj\n\nrj\n?? ??3\n\n !\n\u00f04:85\u00de\n\nand thereafter incorporated into Eq. 4.37 for the numerical\npropagation of the spacecraft\u2019s state vector. Note that if the\nGaussian form of Lagrange\u2019s variational equations is used\nfor the numerical propagation of the spacecraft\u2019s element\nset then the disturbing force given by Eq. 4.85 must be\nconverted into the satellite-based Gaussian or RTN coor-\ndinate system.\n\nFor spacecraft in Earth orbit, the principal gravitational\nperturbations are due to the Moon and the Sun, whilst\nJupiter is the most significant of the planets. However, the\ndisturbing force due to Jupiter\u2019s gravitational acceleration is\ntypically at least five orders of magnitude less than either\nthe Moon or Sun. It can also be shown that the disturbing\nforce of the Sun on a spacecraft in orbit about the Moon is\ngreater than that on one in orbit about the Earth. Finally, it\nshould be noted that typically the orbit of the disturbing\nbody will not be in the same plane as that of the massless\nparticle, that is, the spacecraft, hence the disturbing force\nwill act to cause a change in the orbit plane orientation.\n\n4.3.1.1 Sphere of Influence\nRecognizing that the two-body problem is perturbed by\nadditional gravitational fields, the concept a sphere of\ninfluence defines an almost spherical region, centered about\nthe primary body, within which the motion of a massless\nparticle, that is, the spacecraft, can be considered as pri-\nmarily determined by the gravitational attraction of the\n\n80 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\nprimary body. Using Eqs. 4.37 and 4.85 the equations of\nmotion of a massless particle, C, with respect to two mas-\nsive particles, A and B, in rectangular coordinates may be\nwritten as\n\n\u20acrAC \u00fe\nlA\nr3AC\n\nrAC \u00bc ?GmB\nrBC\nr3BC\n\u00fe rAB\n\nr3AB\n\n? ?\n\u00f04:86\u00de\n\n\u20acrBC \u00fe\nlB\nr3BC\n\nrBC \u00bc ?GmA\nrAC\n\nr3AC\n? rAB\n\nr3AB\n\n? ?\n\u00f04:87\u00de\n\nwhere subscript A and B denote the massive particle and\nradius subscripts AB, BC and AC denote vector directions\nbetween particles. The equations of motion can thus be\nwritten as\n\n\u20acrAC \u00fe !A \u00bc UB \u00f04:88\u00de\n\n\u20acrBC \u00fe !B \u00bc UA: \u00f04:89\u00de\n\nThe !=U ratios thus give the order of magnitude of the\nperturbation within each system due to the other massive\nparticle. The sphere of influence is where the ratios are\nequal.\n\nIn practice if a spacecraft, particle C, is in orbit about a\nplanet, particle B, which is in turn in orbit about a star,\nparticle A, or similarly if particle B is a moon in orbit about\na planet, then rAC ? rBC. Hence, Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9lix Tisserand\n(1845\u20131896) showed that the surface defined as the sphere\nof influence of particle B is almost spherical with radius\n\nrSoI;A \u00bc\nmB\nmA\n\n? ?2=5\nrAB: \u00f04:90\u00de\n\nEquation 4.90 defines the sphere of influence as a single\nsurface. However, practically it is clear that the influence of\nan additional gravitational field is not realized at a bound-\nary. It is therefore useful in astrodynamics to consider the\ndevelopment of two spheres of influence. If the influence of\nthe massive particle B can be neglected when the pertur-\nbation on the massless particle, C, is less than a given\nfraction, ?B, of the acceleration due to massive particle\nA then\n\n!Aj j \u00bc ?B UBj j \u00f04:91\u00de\n\ndefines an outer sphere of influence beyond which motion\ncan be described by the two-body problem about the mas-\nsive particle A. Similarly\n\n!Bj j \u00bc ?A UAj j \u00f04:92\u00de\n\ndescribes an inner sphere of influence within which per-\nturbation due to massive particle A can be neglected and\nmotion can be described by the two-body problem about the\nmassive particle B. Hence, between the two spheres\n\nprolonged periods of motion cannot be accurately described\nby the two-body problem. Defining the mass ratio of the two\nmassive particles as m* = mB/mA, and the radius ratio of the\nmassless particle from the two massive particles as r* = rB/\nrA then\n\n?Bj j \u00bc\nm?\nr2?\n\n1? r?\n1\u00fe r?\n\n? ?2 !\n\u00f04:93\u00de\n\nand\n\n?Aj j \u00bc\nr2?\nm?\n\n1? 1\n1\u00fe r?\u00f0 \u00de2\n\n !\n\u00f04:94\u00de\n\ngive values of ?A and ?B for values of r*.\n\n4.3.2 Non-Spherical Central Body\n\nThe uneven distribution of mass within a central body\nperturbs the gravitational field of the central body from the\npoint-mass representation assumed in the standard two-\nbody problem. Taking the equations of motion written in the\npotential form, see Eq. 4.38, it is convenient to describe the\ngravitational field of a non-spherical central body, outwith\nits surface, using a spherical harmonic expansion. Hence,\nassuming the origin of the reference frame is coincident\nwith the central body\u2019s center of mass, this may be written\nas\n\nU \u00bc l\nr\n\n1\u00fe\nX1\nn\u00bc2\n\nXn\nm\u00bc0\n\nR\n\nr\n\n? ?n\nPnm sin /\u00f0 \u00de Cnm cos mk\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe Snm sin mk\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\" #\n\n\u00f04:95\u00de\n\nwhere R is the mean equatorial radius of the central body, /\nis the geocentric latitude, /0 in Fig. 4.7, of the sub-point of\nthe massless body on the reference ellipsoid, and k is the\nequivalent longitude, recalling that longitude is always\ngeocentric. Cnm and Snm are the gravitational coefficients\ndependent on the mass distribution of the central body;\nwhen n = m these are tesseral harmonic coefficients and\nwhen n = m they are sectoral (or sectorial) harmonic\ncoefficients. Note that the sectoral harmonic coefficients,\nwhen n = m, represent bands of longitude, dividing the\nsphere into 2n longitudinal bands. Whilst the tesseral har-\nmonic coefficients, when n = m, as the name suggests2\n\nmodify the gravitational potential to model specific regions\nas \u2018tiles\u2019 on the reference ellipsoid. Finally, note that the\nLegendre polynomials in Eq. 4.94, Pnm, have the form\n\n2 A tessera is an individual tile in a mosaic.\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 81\n\n\n\nPnm sin /\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc cos2 /\n? ?m\n\n2\ndm\n\nd sin /\u00f0 \u00dem Pn sin /\u00f0 \u00de \u00f04:96\u00de\n\nPn sin /\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\n1\n\n2nn!\ndn\n\nd sin /\u00f0 \u00den sin\n2 /? 1\n\n? ?n\n: \u00f04:97\u00de\n\nIt is common to write Eq. 4.94 using a Jn notation for the\nzonal harmonic gravitational coefficients, as Jn = -Cn,0,\nand separate these terms\n\nU \u00bc l\nr\n\n1?\nX1\n\nn\u00bc2 Jn\nR\n\nr\n\n? ?n\nPn sin /\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00fe\nX1\n\nn\u00bc2\n\nXn\nm\u00bc1\n\nR\n\nr\n\n? ?n\nPnm sin /\u00f0 \u00de Cnm cos mk\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe Snm sin mk\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\n\n2\n6664\n\n3\n7775:\n\n\u00f04:98\u00de\n\nIt is seen in Eq. 4.98 that the zonal harmonics, when\nm = 0, remove longitudinal dependencies, making the\ngravitational field symmetric about the rotational axis of the\ncentral body. Zonal harmonics are thus simply longitudinal\nbands about the central body, such that for any Pn( sin/)\nthere will be n circles of latitude where the Legendre\npolynomial equals zero and hence n ? 1 bands where the\nfunction oscillates above and below the reference ellipsoid.\n\nIt should be noted that if the Gaussian form of Lagran-\nge\u2019s variational equations are used for the numerical prop-\nagation of the spacecraft\u2019s element set that both Eqs. 4.95\nand 4.98 include the gravitational acceleration of a point-\nmass central body. As such, this zero-order effect must be\nremoved before transferring the perturbation vector into the\nsatellite-based Gaussian or RTN coordinate system.\n\nThe dominant perturbation due to the Earth\u2019s shape is J2,\nwhich is three orders of magnitude larger than J3 and\ndominates the gravitational perturbations at Earth. It is\ncommon to approximate the Earth as a body possessing\naxial symmetry, as the longitudinal variations will typically\nbe balanced over the orbit period as the spacecraft moves\naround the Earth. It should be noted however that for a\nspacecraft in geostationary orbit this approximation does\nnot hold, as the spacecraft remains above the same region of\nthe Earth at all times and the spacecraft encounters a form\nof resonance, often termed a triaxiality, which induces an\neast\u2013west drift in the spacecraft\u2019s position.\n\n4.3.3 Atmospheric Effects\n\nThe structure of the atmospheres of the terrestrial planets is\ndiscussed in detail in Chap. 5. However, whilst the structure\nof each atmosphere is distinct, the principal effect they have\non an orbiting body is the same; specifically, they act pri-\nmarily as a retarding force against the velocity vector. The\ncause of this retarding, or drag force is the particles that\n\nmake up the atmosphere. Accurately quantifying the effects\nof an atmosphere on a spacecraft is immensely difficult, and\npredicting these effects is even worse. It should be noted\nthat all bodies moving within an atmosphere generate some\nform of lift force, but for spacecraft this can be neglected\nfor except in the case of high-accuracy analysis. A vast\nrange of factors, each of which can be immensely difficult to\nquantify in terms of its past behavior, let alone predict into\nthe future, interact in a complex fashion to influence the\nupper atmosphere, and specifically the density of the par-\nticles of which it consists.\n\nAs discussed in Chap. 3, atmospheric models can be\nstatic profiles, global analytic fits, or time-varying. Static\nmodels, while simple, may account for effects including\nlatitudinal variations, where, for example, the Earth\u2019s\nequatorial bulge (which results in the J2 perturbation) cau-\nses a variation in altitude, in turn causing the density of the\natmosphere encountered to vary. Similarly, static models\nmay account for longitudinal variations due to other large\nlandmasses, such as the Andes or the Himalayas.\nTime-varying atmospheric models principally aim to cap-\nture causes of temperature fluctuations in the upper atmo-\nsphere. Extreme ultraviolet radiation, EUV, from the Sun\ncauses near-instantaneous heating of the upper atmosphere\nand hence affects atmospheric density. Meanwhile, other\ncauses of atmospheric heating, such as geomagnetic activ-\nities, exhibit a cause and effect delay. As such capturing the\nimpact of such variations can be extremely difficult. Some\nfactors which affect the temperature and hence density of\nthe upper atmosphere include\n\n\u2022 Atmospheric rotation\u2014Atmospheres tend to rotate with\nthe surface of the central body, but shearing effects cause\nthe rate of rotation to decrease at increased altitude.\n\n\u2022 Diurnal variations\u2014As the planet rotates it exposes\ndifferent regions of the atmosphere to different levels of\nsolar heating. The warmest region of the atmosphere lags\nthe sub-solar point and occurs at 1,400\u20131,430 h local\ntime, minimum density is approximately opposite. Note\nthat the time of year is also important here due to the\nobliquity of the ecliptic, which presents different latitudes\nto the Sun at different times of the year.\n\n\u2022 Planetary distance variations\u2014Eccentricities in the orbit\nof the planet about the Sun cause a change in distance\nfrom the Sun to the planet, but these effects are typically\nsmall at Earth.\n\n\u2022 Solar cycle\u2014An approximately 11-year cycle in solar\nmagnetic activity alters the flux of radiation from the Sun\nat Earth.\n\n\u2022 Solar rotation\u2014As the Sun rotates different regions of\nsolar activity are directed towards the Earth. Furthermore,\nthe sidereal rotation period at the Sun\u2019s equator is\n\n82 M.

However, solar rotation var-\nies with latitude as the Sun is composed of gaseous\nplasma.\n\n4.3.3.1 Atmospheric Density Models\nA large number of atmospheric models have been devel-\noped for a range of planets, including the range of Global\nReference Atmosphere Models, GRAM, for Venus, Earth,\nMars, Neptune and Titan based on empirical data and val-\nidated against other empirical data and previous models.\nThe GRAM models are well suited to numerical simulation\nof spacecraft trajectories, using inputs including geograph-\nical position, time, solar and geomagnetic data, and data on\nthe upper atmospheric climate, to provide outputs ranging\nthrough density, temperature, pressure, winds and atmo-\nspheric constituent concentrations. An alternative and con-\nvenient Earth atmospheric model for use with analytical\nmethods is the 1976 US Standard Atmosphere [15], which\nis an ideal, steady-state model of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere at\na latitude of 45? north during moderate solar activity. A\ngood overview of Earth atmospheric models, and how they\nhave developed, is given in [4]. However, it should be\napparent from engineering judgment alone that no single\nmodel can be \u2018best\u2019 for all applications. Table 4.2 and\nFig. 4.12 give the density, pressure, scale height and\nmolecular weight variation with altitude as defined by the\n1976 US Standard Atmosphere [15].\n\nThe simplest possible static atmospheric model is\ndeveloped by considering the gas law, where the tempera-\nture, T, pressure, p, and density, q, are related by\n\np\n\nq\n\u00bc RT\n\nM\n\u00f04:99\u00de\n\nwhere R is the gas constant (8.3144621 J mol-1 k-1) and\nM is the molecular weight of the gas.

Combining\nEqs. 4.99 and 4.100, to eliminate q, and assuming that (RT/\nMg) is a constant, denoted h, the scale height, the variation\nin pressure with altitude is found as\n\np \u00bc p0exp ?\ny? y0\n\nh\n\n? ?\n\u00f04:101\u00de\n\nwhere p0 is the pressure at the reference level, when y = y0.\nNoting that the gas constant can be related to the Boltzmann\nconstant, kB, using the Avogadro constant, NA, such that\nR = kBNA, the scale height is often also written as\n\nh \u00bc kBT\nMmeang\n\n\u00f04:102\u00de\n\nTable 4.2 US standard atmosphere 1976, from [15]\n\nAltitude (km) Density (kg/m3) Pressure (Pa) Scale height (km) Molecular weight (kg/kmol)\n\n0 1.225 1.01e+5 8.4345 29.0\n\n150 2.076e-9 4.54e-4 23.380 24.1\n\n200 2.541e-10 8.47e-5 36.183 21.3\n\n250 6.073e-11 2.48e-5 44.924 19.2\n\n300 1.916e-11 8.77e-6 51.193 17.7\n\n350 7.014e-12 3.45e-6 55.832 16.7\n\n400 2.803e-12 1.45e-6 59.678 16.0\n\n450 1.184e-12 6.45e-7 63.644 15.3\n\n500 5.215e-13 3.02e-7 68.785 14.3\n\n550 2.384e-13 1.51e-7 76.427 13.1\n\n600 1.137e-13 8.21e-8 88.244 11.5\n\n650 5.712e-14 4.89e-8 105.992 9.72\n\n700 3.070e-14 3.19e-8 130.630 8.00\n\n750 1.788e-14 2.26e-8 161.074 6.58\n\n800 1.136e-14 1.70e-8 193.862 5.54\n\n850 7.824e-15 1.34e-8 224.737 4.85\n\n900 5.759e-15 1.09e-8 250.894 4.40\n\n950 4.453e-15 8.98e-9 271.754 4.12\n\n1000 3.561e-15 7.51e-9 288.203 3.94\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 83\n\n\n\nwhere Mmean is the mean molecular mass of dry air in kilo-\ngrams, which at sea level is 28.97u, or 4.81 9 10-26 kg.\nThereafter, assuming that the atmosphere is spherically\nsymmetric, the variation of density with radius r is\n\nq \u00bc q0exp ?\nr ? r0\n\nH\n\n? ?\n\u00f04:103\u00de\n\nwhere H is the density scale height and, for a constant h, is\n\nb \u00bc 1\nH\n\u00bc 1\n\nh\n? 2\n\nr0\n\n? ?\n: \u00f04:104\u00de\n\nNote that the assumption of a constant scale height\nrequires that the density scale height is also constant. While\nthese equations are not exact, they remain valid to an alti-\ntude of several 100 km [16]. The reference altitude, y0, can\nbe the top, or bottom, of a specific atmospheric layer, or a\nnominal altitude, say 100 km, or it may even simply be sea\nlevel. However, it is advisable to use a reference height, and\nhence temperature, as close to the actual height as possible,\nas (RT/Mg) is not strictly constant; thus, by dividing the\natmosphere into thin strips the approximation can be\nmaintained.\n\n4.3.3.2 Equations of Force\nIt is convenient to represent the retarding force of the\natmosphere using the standard drag acceleration equation\n\nFD \u00bc\n1\n2\nq\n\nCDS\n\nm\nv2r\n?vr\nvrj j\n\n? ?\n\u00f04:105\u00de\n\nwhere vr is the velocity relative to the atmosphere, m is the\nmass of the body, S is the reference surface area of the body,\n\ntypically defined as the area of the orthographic projection\nto a plane perpendicular to the free flow, and CD is the drag\ncoefficient of the body with respect to the reference surface\narea. Issues surrounding the drag coefficient will be dis-\ncussed in more detail in the next section. Note that the\nballistic coefficient is usually defined as (m/CDS), where a\nlow ballistic coefficient means the body is more susceptible\nto drag forces.\n\nAtmospheric rotation means that the atmosphere will\ngenerally induce a force out of the plane of motion,\nresulting in a change in the orbit plane orientation. Noting\nthat the west-to-east rotation of the atmosphere is of the\norder 400 m/s and that this is typically greatly in excess of\nmeridional winds (north-to-south, or vice versa). Then to\nthe first-order approximation, where the dominant motion of\nthe atmosphere is west to east, and hence the meridional\nwinds may be neglected. The velocity of the atmosphere in\nthe Earth centered rectangular coordinates system is thus\ndenoted as va \u00bc rxatm cos /. Thereafter, relating the\nvelocity of the body, v, to the velocity of the body relative\nto the atmosphere, vr, Eq. 4.105 may be approximated as\n[16]\n\nFD \u00bc\n1\n2\nqv2\n\nCDS\n\nm\nF\n\nv? va\nv? vaj j\n\n? ?\n\u00f04:106\u00de\n\nwhere\n\nF \u00bc 1? rp\nvp\n\nxatm cos i\n\n? ?2\n: \u00f04:107\u00de\n\nHere xatm is the mean angular rate of rotation of the\natmosphere, which is typically taken to be the same as the\n\nFig. 4.12 US standard\natmosphere 1976, from [15].\nImage Malcolm Macdonald\n\n84 M.

An excellent reference for the effects of an\natmosphere on an orbiting body is [16] in which various\natmospheric phenomena are considered in detail.\n\n4.3.3.3 Drag Coefficient\nDetermining the drag coefficient of an orbiting body is\ncomplicated by the nature of the free molecular flow\nregime. Free molecular flow occurs when the mean free\npath, k, of molecules greatly exceeds a typical linear\ndimension of a body, l. The ratio k/l is termed the Knudsen\nnumber, Kn, and is discussed in more detail later in this\nchapter. Free molecular flow applies when Kn is greater\nthan about 10 [16]. It is a valid assumption therefore that a\nspacecraft of less than 20 m in size at an altitude over\n200 km, where the mean free path exceeds 200 m, is in a\nfree molecular flow regime. As such, the drag force is\ndependent on the body\u2019s shape and size and upon gas\u2014\nsurface interactions that are quantified by the accommoda-\ntion coefficient, which is a temperature dependent measure\nof how much energy the flow loses during the interaction. In\nhyperthermal, free molecular flow regimes, where the speed\nof the body significantly exceeds the mean molecular speed,\nthe drag coefficient is typically taken between 2.0 and 2.5,\ndepending on the accommodation coefficient, for a wide\nrange of shapes and surface constituents.\n\nIt should be noted that at greater altitudes the drag\ncoefficient will increase as the molecular weight of the air\ndecreases and because the assumption of a hyperthermal\nflow regime breaks down. For altitudes where free molec-\nular flow cannot be assumed, for example, in a reentry\nscenario when Kn is between about 5 and perhaps as low as\n\n0.1, it is wise to derive a function which defines the drag\ncoefficient as a function of the Knudsen number, as in [16].\nTypically the drag coefficient of a spacecraft is determined\nduring the orbit check-out phase in order to aid orbit\ndetermination and prediction, but usually only to three\nsignificant figures.\n\n4.3.3.4 Effect of Atmospheric Drag and Orbit\nLifetime\n\nThe principal effect of atmospheric drag is to act as a\nretarding force against the velocity vector, dissipating orbit\nenergy. If the orbit is initially eccentric, the drag force is\nmaximum at periapsis and acts to circularize the orbit.\nDuring the process of circularization it is possible that\nsufficient orbit energy will be dissipated to cause the orbit to\ncompletely decay. Even if this is not the case, once the orbit\nis circularized dissipation of orbit energy will continue and\ncause the orbit radius to gradually decay until the body does\nreenter the atmosphere. General perturbations analysis\npresented in [16] quantifies the effects of atmospheric drag\non orbit size and shape over time, defining four phases of\ndecay due to atmospheric drag and treating them separately\n\u2022 High eccentricities, e J 0:2 and bx J 30\n\u2022 Normal eccentricities, 0:02. e. 0:2 and 3. bx. 30\n\u2022 Low eccentricities, 0\\bx. 3; meaning 0\\e. 0:02\n\u2022 Circular orbits, e = 0 and bx = 0 where\n\nx \u00bc ae \u00f04:113\u00de\n\nand b is defined in Eq. 4.104.\nConsidering low eccentricity orbits and using subscript 1\n\nto denote initial conditions, with z = bx = ae/H, as z will\nbe the function of the Bessel function, it can be shown that\n[16] that (0.008)+11 ??ee L \u00f04:114\u00de\nwhen bx. 3, meaning 0\\e. 0:02, s = t - t1 and sL is\ntaken as\n\nsL \u00bc\n1\n2\n\ne21\nB0\n\n1\u00fe H\n2a1\n\n1? 9\n20\n\nz21\n\n? ?? ?\n\u00f04:115\u00de\n\nsuch that\n\nB0 \u00bc 2pd\nT1\n\nqrp;1x1I1 z1\u00f0 \u00dee?z1 \u00f04:116\u00de\n\nwhere subscript 1 again denotes initial conditions, d is\ndefined in Eq. 4.112, x is defined in Eq. 4.113, T1 is the\ninitial orbit period and I1(z1) is a Bessel function of the first\nkind, of order 1. Equation 4.115 is very nearly the orbit\nlifetime from z = z1 onwards.\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 85\n\n\n\nStrictly, Eqs. 4.114 and 4.115 remain valid until e = 0,\nbut in practice the periapsis will likely drop below a mini-\nmum viable altitude before this happens. It is also prudent\nto limit any periapsis change to less than about 3H, because\nbeyond this the scenario should be paused and a new den-\nsity scale height determined. Failure to do so will overes-\ntimate the orbit decay time. As such whilst Eq. 4.115 can\napproximate the orbit decay time of an initially eccentric\norbit due to atmospheric drag when e. 0:02, the change in\nperiapsis should also be considered to determine the validity\nof using a fixed density scale height. The periapsis distance\ncan be shown [16] to be\n\nwhere\n\nz \u00bc z1\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1? s\n\nsL\n\nr\n1\u00fe 7\n\n4\nH\n\na1\n\nz21\n20\n\ns\nsL\n? ln I1 z1\u00f0 \u00deffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\n1? ssL\n? ?r\n\nI1 z1\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1? ssL\n\nq? ?\n\n0\nBBB@\n\n1\nCCCA\n\n2\n6664\n\n3\n7775\n\n8>>><\n>>>:\n\n9>>>=\n>>>;\n:\n\n\u00f04:118\u00de\n\nThe orbit decay time of an initially circular orbit due to\natmospheric drag is easily determined from first principles.\nHowever, it should be obvious that no orbit is truly circular\nand hence the above bx. 3 conditions give a better\napproximation of low eccentricity orbit decay under atmo-\nspheric drag. Using subscript c to denote initial conditions of\nthe circular orbit, and noting that orbit energy is dissipated\nby aerodynamic drag and that orbit energy is a function\nsolely of the orbit radius, as seen in Eq. 4.19, it is evident\nthat the rate of energy loss is determined by the dissipated\npower and the non-dimensional circular orbit lifetime [1] is\n\nsL\nTc\n\u00bc Z\n\nsL=Tc\n\n0\n\ndt \u00bc 1\n2p\n\n1\n\nqca\n3=2\nc\n\n !\nF?3=2\n? ? m\n\nSCD\n\n? ?\nZrc\n\nrL\n\nqc\nq\n\ndrffiffi\nr\np\n\n\u00f04:119\u00de\n\nwhere q/qC is the exponential atmospheric model from\nEq. 4.103 and rL is the radius at which reentry is taken to\noccur, typically between 120 and 150 km.

Independently of Maxwell,\n\n\u00f04:117\u00de\n\nin 1876, the Italian physicist Adolfo Bartoli (1851\u20131896)\nalso demonstrated the existence of radiation pressure as a\nconsequence of the second law of thermodynamics [18].\nSimilar to the difficulty of accurately quantifying the sur-\nface area of a spacecraft when analyzing atmospheric drag\neffects, the effect of radiation pressure on a spacecraft can\nbe very difficult to quantify accurately. This difficulty is due\nto complex time-varying geometries giving uncertainty in\nilluminated area, self-shadowing, self-illumination due to\nmultiple reflections, variation in time of illuminated mate-\nrial properties due to degradation, and potentially multiple\nsources of radiation pressure; the main sources of radiation\npressure being the Sun and the planets.\n\nUsing quantum mechanics, radiation pressure can be\nvisualized as momentum transported by photons impacting\nand then reflecting off a surface. The term \u2018photon\u2019 was\ncoined by Gilbert N. Lewis (1875\u20131946) in a letter to\nNature magazine in 1926 [19, 20].

At distance\nr from the Sun the energy flux, W, may be written in terms\nof the solar luminosity, LS, as\n\nW \u00bc LS\n4p\n\n1\nr2\n: \u00f04:125\u00de\n\nThe energy, DE, transported across a surface of area A,\nnormal to the incident radiation, in time Dt is given by\n\nDE \u00bc WADt \u00f04:126\u00de\n\nwhich from Eq. 4.123 gives the momentum transported as\n\nDp \u00bc DE\nc\n: \u00f04:127\u00de\n\nThe pressure on the surface is thus defined as the\nmomentum transported per unit time, per unit area, such\nthat\n\nPSRP \u00bc\n1\nA\n\nDp\nDt\n\n? ?\n: \u00f04:128\u00de\n\nAccordingly, using Eq. 4.125 the pressure exerted on the\nsurface due to momentum transport by photons is\n\nPSRP \u00bc\nW\n\nc\n: \u00f04:129\u00de\n\nAs such, the radiation pressure exerted on a surface\nvaries as the inverse square of the distance from the radi-\nation source, that is (1/r2). From Newton\u2019s second law, the\nactual pressure on a perfectly reflecting surface is twice the\nvalue given by Eq. 4.129 because momentum is transferred\nby both incident and by reflected radiation.\n\n4.3.4.1 Solar Radiation Pressure\nThe (1/r2) variation of radiation pressure is perhaps most\nnotably observed when considering the effect of solar\nradiation pressure, SRP, and as such it can be convenient to\nwrite Eq. 4.126 as\n\nW \u00bc WE\nRE\nr\n\n? ?2\n\u00f04:130\u00de\n\nwhere, WE = (Ls/4pRE\n2) is the energy flux at the Earth\u2019s\n\ndistance from the Sun, RE \u00bc 1 au. The luminosity of the Sun\nis approximately 3.839 9 1026 W (or\n3.839 9 1033 erg s-1) [21]. However, it can be slightly\nhigher if solar neutrino radiation is considered as well as\n\nelectromagnetic radiation. Additionally, the Sun is a weakly\nvariable star. The principal fluctuation is due to the 11-year\nsolar cycle, giving a periodic variation in luminosity of\nabout \u00b10.1 %. From the solar luminosity the energy flux at\nthe Earth\u2019s mean distance from the Sun, or solar irradiance,\ncan be determined as approximately 1,366 W/m2; which\ncorresponds to the integrated power from ASTM E490-\n00a(2006) and ISO-21348 as discussed in Chap. 3. How-\never, the actual \u2018best\u2019 solar irradiance at the Earth\u2019s distance\nfor use in engineered systems remains subject to engineer-\ning judgment, as some values quoted are as high as\n1,377 W/m2. It is therefore often best to select a solar\nirradiance that gives a conservative design estimate. For\nexample, in Chap. 10 the conservative value of 1,353 W/m2\n\nis discussed for use in power system design.\nThe acceleration due to SRP can be determined using a\n\nreflectivity coefficient, CR, such that\n\nFSRP \u00bc ?\nPSRPCRASRP\n\nm\n\nrSRP\nrSRPj j\n\n\u00f04:131\u00de\n\nwhere ASRP is the surface area exposed to the solar radiation\nand rSRP is a vector from the spacecraft to the Sun. As such\nthe acceleration due to SRP is always directed away from\nthe Sun. The reflectivity coefficient, CR, takes a value\nbetween zero and two and characterizes how the incoming\nradiation is reflected. If CR is zero the body is transparent to\nincoming radiation, if CR is one all incoming radiation is\nabsorbed, that is, it is a black-body with zero reflection, and\nif CR is two the body is a perfect reflector. A perfectly\nreflective surface facing the Sun at Earth\u2019s mean distance\nfrom the Sun will experience a pressure of just over 9 l Pa.\nThe value of CR is clearly critical in determining the per-\nturbing acceleration magnitude due to SRP. However, due\nto the difficulties outlined previously it is almost impossible\nto predict what value of CR a spacecraft will have. Instead,\njust as with the spacecraft drag coefficient, CR is typically\ndetermined from in-flight data. It should also be noted that\nfor solutions that are slightly more detailed, the SRP\n\nTable 4.3 Solar irradiance at each of the planets, from ASTM E-490\n\nSolar irradiance (W/m2)\n\nPlanet Mean Perihelion Aphelion\n\nMercury 9,116.4 14,447.5 6,271.1\n\nVenus 2,611.0 2,646.4 2,575.7\n\nEarth 1,366.1 1,412.4 1,321.7\n\nMars 588.6 715.9 491.7\n\nJupiter 50.5 55.7 45.9\n\nSaturn 15.0 16.8 13.5\n\nUranus 3.7 4.1 3.4\n\nNeptune 1.5 1.5 1.5\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 87\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_10\n\n\nacceleration can be split into three components, absorbed\nradiation, and specular and diffusely reflected radiation.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that as the orbit of the Earth\nabout the Sun is slightly elliptical, solar irradiance at the\nEarth, and hence radiation pressure, varies by approxi-\nmately 3.5 % over the year. The mean, maximum and\nminimum solar irradiance at each planet is found in\nTable 4.3.\n\nThe effect of SRP can be significant in certain orbit\nregimes and negligible in others, it can also often average to\nzero over the orbit period. Depending on the orbit regime,\nthe orbit size, shape and orientation, and spacecraft\nparameters, the effect of SRP can be exploited to enhance a\nspacecraft\u2019s performance. A well-known example of this is\nthe concept of solar sailing, where a large lightweight\nreflective surface provides a propulsive thrust for the\nspacecraft to perform orbit maneuvers [22, 23]. A similar\nconcept is widely used for attitude control of spacecraft in\nboth Earth orbit and for inner solar system missions, where\ndue to the (1/r2) variation in radiation pressure, significant\nforces can be generated. Both the Mariner-10 and MES-\nSENGER spacecraft used SRP by design to offset propellant\nrequirements, while the Hayabusa spacecraft was able to\nuse SRP to recover from a partial failure of its attitude\ncontrol systems. At Earth it is common to use so-called\n\u2018trim tabs\u2019 to aid attitude control of large spacecraft in\ngeostationary orbit, thereby reducing propellant require-\nments and extending mission lifetime. Trim tabs are typi-\ncally mounted onto the solar arrays in order to maximize the\ntorque delivered.\n\n4.3.4.2 Planetary Albedo and Infrared Radiation\nOf the solar radiation that impinges on a body, a certain\nfraction is reflected from that body and the ratio of reflected\nto impinging radiation is termed the body\u2019s albedo. In\nastronomy two measures of reference are commonly used,\ngeometric and Bond albedo. The geometric albedo of an\n\nastronomical body is a measure of its brightness when\nilluminated from a phase angle behind the observer, whilst\nthe Bond albedo is a measure of the total proportion of\nelectromagnetic radiation reflected. The geometric and\nBond albedo of each planet, and the Moon, is given in\nTable 4.4. The remaining solar radiation is absorbed and re-\nemitted at a later time as infrared radiation; from Earth this\namounts to about 237 W/m2. Due to atmospheric absorption\nat specific wavelengths, it is common to split the effects of\nplanetary albedo and infrared radiation into specific wave-\nlengths. At Earth, the effects of albedo can typically be\nneglected for all but high-accuracy calculations, but at other\nbodies, especially those without atmospheres, the effect can\nbe significant. The highest known albedo in the solar system\nis found at the Saturnian moon Enceladus, with an albedo of\nover 0.99 because it is essentially fresh snow.\n\n4.3.5 Minor Forces\n\nA myriad of minor forces act on a spacecraft, but typically\nthese can be neglected.\n\n4.3.5.1 Tides\nTides are a result of gravitational effects causing a distortion\nin a body\u2019s mass distribution. The most apparent tidal\nmotion at Earth is that of the oceans, but the most astro-\ndynamically significant tidal effect is termed \u2018Solid-Earth\ntides\u2019, which are deformations of the Earth\u2019s shape due,\nprincipally, to the gravitational attraction of the Moon and\nthe Sun. It should also be noted that forces in the Earth\u2019s\ninterior can contribute to Solid-Earth tides, as can the\ncentrifugal effect of the Earth\u2019s rotation. The effect of tides\nis typically determined for Earth orbiting spacecraft through\nanalysis of flight data, as it is not directly observable.\n\n4.3.5.2 Solar wind\nThe solar wind is a stream of charged particles ejected from\nthe Sun and is distinct from solar radiation pressure. The\nsolar wind exerts a pressure approximately four orders of\nmagnitude less than direct solar radiation pressure.\n\n4.3.5.3 General Relativity Effects\nAlthough not strictly a perturbing force, General Relativity\n(GR) dictates that light travels in a curved path in space due\nto massive particles. As such, when measuring the position\nof distant galaxies or quasars, GR effects must be consid-\nered, as the light will have been \u2018deflected\u2019 by massive\nobjects it has passed en route. For spacecraft, this angular\ndeflection is typically negligible. However, in certain sce-\nnarios it can cause an apparent spacecraft deviation from a\npropagated trajectory.\n\nTable 4.4 Geometric and bond albedo at each of the planets and the\nMoon\n\nPlanet Geometric albedo Bond albedo\n\nMercury 0.14 0.07\n\nVenus 0.67 0.90\n\nEarth 0.37 0.31\n\nMoon 0.12 0.11\n\nMars 0.17 0.25\n\nJupiter 0.52 0.34\n\nSaturn 0.47 0.34\n\nUranus 0.51 0.30\n\nNeptune 0.41 0.29\n\n88 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\n4.4 Orbit Classifications\n\nThe objectives of a space mission typically drive the mis-\nsion design towards the use of certain orbits. In addition to\nthis, consideration of orbit parameters and perturbations\nleads to the definition of special orbits, with specific\ndesirable characteristic. As such, it is convenient to define\ndifferent orbit classifications; here these classifications are\ngiven specifically for Earth, but it should be apparent that\nequivalent orbits may exist for any central body.\n\n4.4.1 Low Earth Orbit\n\nGenerally classified as extending from the Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\nellipsoid to below the peak radiation levels of the inner van\nAllen belt, the Low Earth Orbit (LEO), regime is specifi-\ncally defined by inter-agency agreement to be the altitude\nrange 160\u20132,000 km. Due to the partial-vacuum nature of\nthis region, all orbits in LEO experience the effects of the\nupper atmosphere, including atmospheric drag, but as dis-\ncussed in the preceding section beyond approximately\n1,000 km altitude the effects can be marginal. Additionally,\ndue to atmospheric drag effects the altitude is typically\ngreater than 300 km.\n\nWhilst atmospheric drag is the most apparent conse-\nquence of the upper atmosphere, chemical interactions\nbetween the atmosphere and the materials on the spacecraft\nshould also be considered; particularly due to atomic oxy-\ngen. Indeed, oxidization due to atomic oxygen requires that\nspacecraft in LEO be covered in a non-oxidizing material.\nFurthermore, due to protection by the atmosphere, and its\nlocation below the peak radiation levels of the inner van\nAllen belt, the LEO regime exposes spacecraft to relatively\nlow levels of radiation. However, the short orbit period\npotentially exposes the spacecraft to frequent and lengthy\npassages through the Earth\u2019s shadow, resulting in thermal\nshocks and cycling.\n\nBy agreement of the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coor-\ndination Committee, LEO is one of two designated space\ndebris protected orbit regimes; the other is the geosyn-\nchronous region. Spacecraft are generally required to exit\nprotected orbit regimes within 25 years of the end of life.\n\n4.4.2 Medium Earth Orbit\n\nExtending from LEO, the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)\nregime extends to below the geosynchronous region. It is\nnoteworthy that the MEO includes near-circular orbits of\n12 h period, an example ground track of which is shown in\nFig. 4.9. One of the most common applications within the\n\nMEO regime is constellations of spacecraft providing a\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) services. Typ-\nically, spacecraft in MEO are located beyond the inner van\nAllen belt but are more exposed to the outer van Allen belt\nthan geosynchronous spacecraft, and thus suffer a higher\nelectron flux.\n\n4.4.3 Geosynchronous Orbit\n\nA geosynchronous orbit is an Earth orbit with period equal\nto the Earth\u2019s sidereal rotation period, with restrictions on\norbit inclination and eccentricity. By agreement of the Inter-\nAgency Space Debris Coordination Committee space debris\nin the geosynchronous region is restricted to a maximum of\n15? geodetic latitude and to within 200 km of the geosta-\ntionary altitude.\n\n4.4.3.1 Geostationary Orbit\nA geostationary orbit (GEO) is idealized as a circular\ngeosynchronous orbit with zero inclination; the altitude of\nthis orbit is defined as 35,786 km using the equatorial Earth\nradius. An object in GEO appears stationary to an observer\non the ground. Typically, spacecraft considered to be in\nGEO do not have a perfect GEO orbit, but will have a slight\ninclination and/or eccentricity, causing the spacecraft to\ndepict a lemniscate curve as shown (in exaggeration for a\nGEO) in Fig. 4.9 for a 30? inclined geosynchronous orbit.\nGeostationary orbits are widely used for communications\nand Earth observation applications. However, as the\nobserved geodetic latitude is increased the observation\nzenith angle increases such that Earth observation applica-\ntions become restricted beyond approximately 55? latitude,\nand communication applications beyond approximately 70?\nlatitude. The orbit environment in GEO is relatively benign,\nbut it is still within the outer van Allen belt and hence some\nradiation effects must be considered.\n\n4.4.3.2 Geostationary Transfer Orbit\nA geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) is an orbit used to\ntransfer spacecraft into the geosynchronous region. A GTO\ntypically has its periapsis within the LEO region and its\napoapsis near GEO. Most spacecraft designed to operate in\nGEO are inserted into a GTO by the launch vehicle and then\nprogress to GEO using an on-board propulsion system. The\norbit environment in GTO is very harsh due to the short\norbit period that exposes the spacecraft to much more fre-\nquent passages through the Earth\u2019s shadow than during its\noperational life, resulting in thermal shocks and cycling, as\nwell as passages through both the inner and outer van Allen\nbelts twice per orbit.\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 89\n\n\n\n4.4.4 High Earth Orbit\n\nA High Earth Orbit is an orbit with its apoapsis altitude\nmore than 200 km beyond that of a geostationary orbit.\n\n4.4.4.1 Highly Elliptical Orbit\nA Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO) is a subset of the High\nEarth Orbit classification in which the orbit eccentricity\nplaces the periapsis within LEO. Such high eccentricities,\nthrough Kepler\u2019s second law, have long dwell times around\napoapsis, where they appear almost stationary to a ground-\nbased observer. An example of a service delivered from\nHEO is the Sirius Satellite Radio service in North America.\nRadiosat-1, -2, and -3 were placed into 24 h HEOs, and\nRadiosat-5 into a conventional GEO. Radiosat-4 was built\nas a ground spare for Radiosat 1-3 and held in storage until\n2012, when it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institu-\ntion\u2019s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.\nAs with GTOs, HEOs can experience quite a severe space\nenvironment.\n\n4.4.5 Sun-Synchronous Orbits\n\nThrough careful consideration of the orbit perturbation\nforce due to a non-spherical central body, a secular varia-\ntion of the ascending node angle of a near-polar orbit can be\ninduced without expulsion of propellant. Consequently, the\norbit perturbations can be used to maintain the orbit plane in\na fixed orientation with respect to the Sun-line throughout\nthe full year of the primary body; such orbits are termed\nSun-synchronous orbits. Sun-synchronous orbits about the\nEarth are typically near-circular LEOs, with an altitude of\nless than 1,500 km. It is normal to design a LEO such that\nthe orbit period is synchronised with the rotation of the\nEarth\u2019s surface over a given interval, such that a repeating\nground track is established. A repeating ground track,\ntogether with the near-constant illumination conditions of\nthe ground track when observed from a Sun-synchronous\norbit, enables repeat observations of a target over an\nextended time under similar illumination conditions; for this\nreason, Sun-synchronous orbits are used extensively by\nEarth observation platforms.\n\nRecalling that the dominant perturbation due to the\nEarth\u2019s shape is J2, which is three orders of magnitude\nlarger than J3, Eq. 4.97 can, for a body possessing axial\nsymmetry, be written as\n\nU r; b\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc l\nr\n\n1?\nX1\nn\u00bc0\n\nJn\nR?\nr\n\n? ?n\nPn sin b\n\n\" #\n\u00f04:132\u00de\n\nwhere R? is the radius of the Earth.

The\nascending node angle is described in the Gaussian form in\nEq. 4.42, and by modifying this such that the position-fixing\nelement is the true anomaly, the rate of change of the\nascending node angle becomes\n\ndX\ndh\n\u00bc r\n\n3\n\nlp\nR T N\u00bd ?\n\n0\n0\n\nsin\u00f0h\u00fex\u00de\nsin i\n\n? ?\n2\n4\n\n3\n5: \u00f04:135\u00de\n\nThus, Up within Eq. 4.134 is required in terms of the\nsatellite-based Gaussian coordinate system, or simply RTN;\nsee Sect. 4.1.5. This is obtained by differentiation of the\npotential with respect to the spacecraft centred RTN coor-\ndinate system.

Macdonald\n\n\n\n4.4.6 Critical Inclination Orbits\n\nThrough further careful consideration of the orbit pertur-\nbation force due to a non-spherical central body, it is noted\nthat the induced secular variation of the argument of\nperiapsis is inclination dependent. The argument of periapsis\nangle is described in the Gaussian form in Eq. 4.43, and by\nmodifying this such that the position-fixing element is the\ntrue anomaly, the rate of change of the ascending node angle\nbecomes\n\ndx\ndh\n\u00bc r\n\n2\n\nle\nR T N\u00bd ?\n\n? cos h\n1\u00fe rp\n? ?\n\nsin h\nre\n\np tan i sin h\u00fe x\u00f0 \u00de\n\n2\n64\n\n3\n75: \u00f04:140\u00de\n\nBy combining Eqs. 4.136\u20134.138 with Eq. 4.140, and\nassuming that the change in other orbit elements is small\nover the integral, the expression for the change in argument\nof periapsis is found to be\n\nDx\u00f0 \u00de2p0 \u00bc\n3J2r2 3\u00fe 5 cos 2i\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de\n\n4a2 ?1\u00fe e2\u00f0 \u00de2\n: \u00f04:141\u00de\n\nSeeking zero secular variation of the argument of pe-\nriapsis, Eq. 4.141 is solved equal to zero; which occurs\nwhen (3 ? 5 cos (2i)) = 0. Consequently, the critical\ninclination at Earth is determined as 90 \u00b1 26.6?. Thus to\nthe order of J2, all Earth orbits inclined at these values show\nno rotation of the apsidal line, irrespective of the values of\nsemi-major axis and eccentricity.\n\n4.4.6.1 Molniya Orbit\nNamed after the series of Soviet satellites which used the\norbit, a Molniya (meaning \u2018lightning\u2019) orbit is a type of\nHEO inclined at the critical inclination, with an orbit period\nof one half of a sidereal day. An example ground track of a\nMolniya orbit is shown in Fig. 4.9. By coupling the apogee\ndwell features of a HEO with critical inclination, this orbit\novercomes the difficulties of communicating with high lat-\nitude regions from a GEO. As with most HEOs, Molniya\norbits can experience quite a severe space environment.\n\n4.4.6.2 Tundra Orbit\nThis is a type of geosynchronous HEO inclined at the\ncritical inclination. As with other geosynchronous orbits,\nthe ground track of a tundra orbit is a lemniscate curve.\n\n4.5 Trajectory Maneuvering\n\nThe requirement to maneuver from one orbit to another is,\nby definition, a critical study within astrodynamics because\nit is through the addition of \u2018\u2018artificially induced forces\u2019\u2019\nthat astrodynamics is distinct from its parent sciences into\nthe field of engineering.\n\nThe problem of maneuvering from an initial vector-\ndefined position to a target vector-defined position in a given\ntime is known as Lambert\u2019s Problem and is applied, for\nexample, to target a flyby or rendezvous with a target body.\nHowever, for preliminary trajectory maneuvering analysis it\n\nFig. 4.13 Surface of Sun-\nsynchronous orbits within LEO.\nImage Malcolm Macdonald\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 91\n\n\n\nis often sufficient to consider only the required velocity\nchange, negating the requirement to solve Lambert\u2019s Prob-\nlem. Thus Lambert\u2019s Problem is not addressed further herein.\n\n4.5.1 Coplaner Maneuvers\n\nIt is self-evident that coplanar maneuvers can alter the orbit\nsemi-major axis, eccentricity and argument of periapsis; this\ncan also be seen mathematically in Eqs. 4.39\u20134.43. Copla-\nnar burns are either tangential (to the orbit) or non-tan-\ngential. From an efficiency perspective tangential burns are\npreferred, but non-tangential burns can shorten the transfer\ntime between two orbits at the expense of requiring a larger\nburn and hence more fuel.\n\nConsider a spacecraft at an apsis of an initial orbit. If a\npropulsive maneuver is made to alter the spacecraft\u2019s\nvelocity magnitude the effect is to move the opposite apsis,\nas shown in Fig. 4.14. This can be understood by inserting\nEqs. 4.5 and 4.6 into Eq. 4.17 to gain the velocity at each\napsis. By increasing the velocity at periapsis the velocity at\n\napoapsis is reduced, and vice versa. Thus, a spacecraft can\nmove between two orbits that are tangential at an apsis by a\nsingle impulsive maneuver at that apsis. The size of the\nvelocity change maneuver that is required is defined by the\ntarget change of radius of the opposite apsis. An example of\nsuch a maneuver is that of a spacecraft inserted into a GTO\nby the launch vehicle, which then progresses to GEO by\nusing an on-board propulsion system to alter its velocity at\nthe GTO apoapsis.\n\n4.5.1.1 Hohmann Transfer\nThe simplest and most common approximation of a tra-\njectory maneuver between two coplanar and coaxial orbits,\nwhich are not tangential, is the Hohmann transfer, as this\ntypically provides the minimum required change in veloc-\nity. A Hohmann transfer joins two coplanar and coaxial\norbits, which are not tangential, through an intermediate\norbit that is tangential to both the initial and final orbit.\n\nA Hohmann transfer maneuver consists of two impulsive\nvelocity changes, the first to transfer onto the intermediate\norbit, and the second to transfer from this to the final orbit,\n\nFig. 4.14 Tangential burn at an\napsis. Image Malcolm\nMacdonald\n\nFig. 4.15 Hohmann transfer to a\nlarger semi-major axis orbit.\nImage Malcolm Macdonald\n\n92 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\nas illustrated in Fig. 4.15. Note that neither the initial nor\nthe final orbit need be circular. As before, the size of each\nmaneuver that is the required change in velocity is defined\nby the target change of radius of the opposite apsis. As such,\nin Fig. 4.15 the initial maneuver, DVi, increases the apo-\napsis radius to the target value, whilst the second maneuver,\nDVf, increases the periapsis radius to the target value.\n\nUsing Eq. 4.17 the total velocity change can be found as\n\nDV \u00bc Vij j \u00fe Vf\n?? ?? \u00f04:142\u00de\n\nwhere\n\nVi \u00bc Vp;t ?

Finally, note that the orbit maneuver duration\nis simply half of the period of the intermediate orbit, which\n\nfrom Eq. 4.14 is stransfer \u00bc p\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\na3=l\n\np\n.\n\n4.5.1.2 Bi-Elliptic Transfers\nWhen the required change in orbit radius is large, the\nHohmann transfer is found to be sub-optimal [4, 24]. In this\ncase, a third orbit maneuver is introduced as shown in\n\nFig. 4.16, and the result is termed a bi-elliptic transfer. In a\nbi-elliptic transfer the initial maneuver occurs at the same\nlocation as in a Hohmann transfer, but the magnitude of the\nvelocity change is increased such that the apoapsis of the\nintermediate orbit is larger than that of the target, or final\norbit. A second maneuver is performed at the apoapsis of\nthe intermediate orbit to create a second intermediate orbit\nwith a periapsis matching that of the target value. The\nperiapsis of the second intermediate orbit is thus tangential\nwith the target orbit, at which point a third maneuver is\nperformed to acquire the final orbit. The orbit maneuver\nduration is the sum of half of the orbit period of each of the\nintermediate orbits.\n\nA Hohmann transfer between two circular, co-planer\norbits is found to be optimal (minimum change in total\nvelocity, and hence minimum fuel mass) when the ratio of\ninitial to final orbit radius is \\11.94 [24]. Meanwhile, a\nbi-elliptic transfer between two circular, co-planer orbits\ncan be shown optimal when the ratio of initial to final orbit\nradius is[15.58 [24]. When the ratio of initial to final orbit\nradius is between 11.94 and 15.58, further analysis is\nrequired to determine the intermediate radius, rt, at which\nthe bi-elliptic transfer becomes optimal. Note, at orbit\nradius ratio 11.94, rt ? ? and the intermediate orbit is a\nparabola.\n\n4.5.2 Plane Change\n\nThe orbit plane is perpendicular to the angular momentum\nvector, h. As such, a pure plane change maneuver is\nequivalent to a change in direction of the angular momen-\ntum vector through the application of a torque to the orbit\n\nFig. 4.16 Bi-Elliptic transfer\nbetween two circular orbits.\nImage Malcolm Macdonald\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 93\n\n\n\nplane. From a simple vector analysis, the change in required\nvelocity, assuming v1 = v2, is\n\nDV \u00bc 2V sin f\n2\n\n? ?\n\u00f04:145\u00de\n\nwhere f is the plane change angle; for example, a change in\norbit inclination.\n\n4.5.3 Ideal Rocket Equation\n\nThe required propellant mass for a given change in velocity\ncan be determined through conservation of linear momen-\ntum and by defining the Specific Impulse, Isp, of a propul-\nsion system as the ratio of thrust to Earth-surface weight\nflow rate, _mg, where _m is the propellant mass flow rate. That\nis, Isp \u00bc F= _mg \u00bc ve=g; where F is propulsive thrust and ve\nis the exit velocity of the propulsion system exhaust gas;\nunits of Isp are seconds. By definition, Isp is a measure of the\nenergy content of the propellant and how efficiently it is\nconverted into thrust.\n\nThe ideal rocket equation gives the available change in\nvelocity by a spacecraft as\n\nDV \u00bc gIspln\nm0\n\nm0 ? mp\n\n? ?\n\u00bc gIspln\n\nm0\nmf\n\n? ?\n\u00f04:146\u00de\n\nwhere m0 is the initial mass of the spacecraft and mp is the\npropellant mass, such that the final mass is mf = (m0 - mp).\nNote that this is an ideal case with no losses and as such\nrepresents the ideal limiting case. It can be useful in pre-\nliminary studies to determine the fuel mass fraction, mp/m0,\nrequired to deliver a given change in velocity. As the fuel\nmass fraction tends to one, the allowable spacecraft dry\nmass (spacecraft mass without propellant) tends to zero.\nThe fuel mass fraction is\n\nmp\nm0\n\u00bc 1? e? DV=Ispg\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f04:147\u00de\n\n4.5.4 Finite Burn Losses\n\nThe above assumption that the change in velocity is deliv-\nered by a single impulsive maneuver breaks down when\nconsidering large maneuvers where, in practice, the space-\ncraft thruster(s) may fire for several tens of minutes or more\nin order to deliver the required thrust and hence change in\nvelocity. Consequently, the thrust is delivered over an arc of\nthe trajectory, typically centered about an apsis. This spatial\ndistribution of the thrust results in an inefficiency in the use\n\nof propellant and is termed \u2018finite burn\u2019 losses. To coun-\nteract finite burn losses the required change in velocity is\noften delivered over a number of orbits in order to minimize\nthe arc over which thrust is delivered. However, such a\nstrategy can have a significant effect on the time taken to\ncomplete the maneuver.\n\n4.5.5 Continuous Thrust\n\nThrough the application of low-thrust propulsion systems,\nsuch as solar electric propulsion, it is possible to apply\ncontinuous thrust to a spacecraft. Such trajectories differ\nsignificantly from those of high-thrust spacecraft, with only\nsmall changes in the element set per orbit.\n\nAdopting the assumption of continuous thrusting by a\nspacecraft in an initially circular Keplerian orbit enables\nanalytical solutions to be gained for some general problems.\nFor example, when the thrust vector is directed either\nradially or tangentially general analytical results can be\nfound. This principle was apparently first used by Tsien [25]\nwho considered the use of both radially and tangentially\nconstant acceleration in terms of \u2018\u2018take off\u2019\u2019 from an orbit,\nshowing that tangentially constant acceleration is much\nmore efficient than radial thrusting in gaining orbit energy\nbecause the required mass ratio is much reduced. Analytical\nsolutions were also developed for transfers between inclined\ncircular orbits by Edelbaum [26], the results of which allow\nfor estimation of the velocity increment (DV) and the\ntransfer time for missions with continuous low-level\nthrusting. This work has since been extended to remove the\nneed for numerical integration of differential equations and\nto accurately accommodate the effects of periods of zero\nthrust that may be encountered due to power unavailability\nduring, for example, passage through the Earth\u2019s shadow\nwhen using solar electric propulsion [27\u201329].\n\n4.5.5.1 Low-Thrust Orbit Raising\nConsider a spacecraft in a quasi-circular orbit, thrusting\ncontinuously along the velocity vector (or against it for orbit\nlowering). Noting that the work done by the propulsion\nsystem will increase the orbit energy, the trajectory\nbecomes an outward quasi-circular spiral due to the con-\ntinuous thrust. Assuming a constant acceleration, and hence\na short transfer with high specific impulse giving a (near-\n)constant mass spacecraft, and recalling the orbit energy\nequation, Eq. 4.19, the effective change in velocity from\ninitial to final orbit can be shown to equal the change in\ncircular orbit velocity. Moreover, the transfer time can be\napproximated as Dt \u00bc DV=aprop, where aprop \u00bc Fprop=m is\nthe acceleration due to the continuous thrust, Fprop.\n\n94 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\n4.5.6 Gravity Assist\n\nThe trajectory of a spacecraft can be altered using the rel-\native motion of a large celestial body to deflect the velocity\nvector of the spacecraft, hence in effect providing a non-\ntangential maneuver without the use of propellant. The first\ngravity assist maneuver was performed by the Mariner-10\nprobe at Venus on February 5, 1974. The Cassini-Huygens\nmission used Venus twice, then Earth and finally Jupiter en\nroute to Saturn, giving a transfer duration of 6.7 years.\nA Hohmann transfer would have required only 6 years, but\nthe total propulsive change in velocity required to be\ndelivered by the spacecraft by using gravity assist maneu-\nvers was reduced from about 16 km/s for a Hohmann\ntransfer to only 2 km/s.\n\nAssuming a symmetric hyperbolic pass, conservation of\nenergy requires the spacecraft hyperbolic excess velocity,\nV?, be the same on both the arrival and departure asymp-\ntotes. The spacecraft hyperbolic excess velocity, V?, that is\nthe velocity relative to the planet, can be found from the vis-\nviva equation, Eq. 4.17, with r ? ?\n\nV21 \u00bc ?\nl\na\n\u00bc 2ET : \u00f04:148\u00de\n\nNote however that the vector velocity V1 is altered by\nthe encounter due to a change in its direction.\n\nThe true anomaly of the arrival asymptote can be found\nfrom the equation of a polar equation of a conic section,\nEq. 4.4, as\n\nha \u00bc cos?1\n?1\ne\n\n? ?\n: \u00f04:149\u00de\n\nThe change in direction of V1 from ha is denoted by W,\nas shown in Fig. 4.17. The departure asymptote true\nanomaly is thus\n\nha \u00bc p? ha \u00feW\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f04:150\u00de\nHence, if the motion were unperturbed during the flyby\n\nthe departure asymptote would have true anomaly (p - ha).\nUsing Eq. 4.148, the change in direction of V1 can be\nwritten as\n\nW\n2\n\u00bc ha ?\n\np\n2\n\u00bc sin?1 ?1\n\ne\n\n? ?\n: \u00f04:151\u00de\n\nUsing Eq. 4.6 and 4.147, the eccentricity can be written\nas\n\ne \u00bc 1\u00fe V\n2\n1rp\nl\n\n: \u00f04:152\u00de\n\nThe resultant change in velocity can be written as\n\nDV \u00bc 2V1 sin\nW\n2\n\n? ?\n\u00bc 2V1\n\ne\n: \u00f04:153\u00de\n\nThe maximum change in velocity is found by maxi-\nmizing the deflection angle, W, which is maximized by\nminimizing the flyby distance.\n\nA gravity assist maneuver is targeted using the B-plane,\ndefined as the plane perpendicular to the hyperbolic excess\nvelocity vector and the B-point, the point in the B-plane that\nthe spacecraft would pass through if the gravity of the body\nbeing flown past were neglected; as shown in Fig. 4.17.\nFrom conservation of angular momentum, rpVp \u00bc BV1 as\nall vectors are perpendicular, and noting that the velocity on\na hyperbolic orbit is V2 = [(2l/r) ? V?\n\n2 ] the B-point can be\nrelated to the flyby periapsis as\n\nB \u00bc rp\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1\u00fe 2l\n\nV21rp\n\n? ?s\n\u00f04:154\u00de\n\nwhere l is the gravitational parameter of the body providing\nthe assist. Thus, for a given B-point, the resultant periapsis\nradius can be determined and the risk of collision with the\nbody assessed.\n\nDue to the limitation on minimum approach, and the\nresultant limitation on velocity change, an additional\nchange in velocity can be gained by firing thrusters at the\nclosest approach point, or by using aerodynamic surfaces to\ngenerate lift and drag; this latter option is termed an\n\nFig. 4.17 Gravity assist B-plane and B-point. Image Malcolm\nMacdonald\n\n4 Introduction to Astrodynamics 95\n\n\n\naeroassist. When considering gravity assist trajectories it is\noften convenient to use the method of \u2018patched conics\u2019 to\ndivide the trajectory into manageable segments. As the\nname suggests, the patched conics method simply patches\ntogether multiple conic sections based on logical phases, for\nexample the entry or exit of a sphere of influence as shown\nin Fig. 4.17.\n\n4.5.7 Aerobraking\n\nThe concept behind aerobraking is to use atmospheric drag\nto aid the process of capturing a spacecraft about a target\nbody. Using a low periapsis, the apoapsis is reduced to the\ndesired point and then the spacecraft propulsion system is\nused to increase periapsis and thus stop orbit decay due to\natmospheric drag. Aerobraking was first performed by the\nHiten spacecraft using the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The first\naerobraking maneuver away from the Earth was performed\nby the Magellan spacecraft during its mission extension\nphase at Venus. The first spacecraft to use aerobraking as\nthe primary form of capture and orbit lowering was Mars\nGlobal Surveyor, which used its solar panels to control the\naerobraking process. By using aerobraking the Mars Global\nSurveyor spacecraft propellant requirements were reduced\nby over 220 kg. Note however that some saved propellant\nmass is required for the aerobraking assembly and thermal\nprotection system.\n\n4.5.8 Formation Flying and Rendezvous\n\nWhen considering the close relative motion of spacecraft,\nsuch as close formation flying or the terminal phase of\nrendezvous maneuvers, a reference frame centered on the\n\nprimary body of the system, i.e. Sun or Earth, is typically\ninappropriate as the differential acceleration on each\nspacecraft is small and fine relative motion may be masked\nby orbital motion. In this case, it is standard to directly\ndescribe the relative motion of one spacecraft in a non-\ninertial reference frame centered on the other spacecraft;\nthis has the additional advantage for rendezvous scenarios,\nof the guidance bing described relative to the target\nspacecraft.\n\nThe equations of relative motion are given in the satel-\nlite-based Gaussian, or RSW coordinate system introduced\npreviously, where as shown in Fig. 4.18 the origin is located\nat the target, or primary spacecraft. Denoting a spacecraft as\nthe target or primary is of arbitrary importance and is typ-\nically only a matter of context. The equations of motion of\nthe primary spacecraft are, from Eq. 4.3 and using two-\nbody motion, given as\n\n\u20acrP \u00bc ?\nl\n\nr3P\nrP: \u00f04:155\u00de\n\nThe secondary spacecraft can be described similarly,\nhowever it will be subject to some differential acceleration,\nF \u00bc fx fy fz\u00bd ?, and is thus akin to Eq. 4.37\n\n\u20acrS \u00bc ?\nl\n\nr3S\nrS \u00fe F: \u00f04:156\u00de\n\nAssuming that the relative vector, rrel, from the primary\nspacecraft to the secondary spacecraft is small, less than\napproximately 10 % of the orbit radius, and noting that it is\ngiven as rrel \u00bc rS ? rP\u00f0 \u00de, the relative equation of motion of\nthe secondary spacecraft can be derived through the use of\nvector identities after differencing Eqs. 4.155 and 4.156.\nThereafter, the linearized form of the equations of motion\ndepends on the applied simplifying assumptions. The most\ncommon simplifying assumption made is that both the\n\nFig. 4.18 Relative motion\ngeometry, not to scale. Image\nMalcolm Macdonald\n\n96 M. Macdonald\n\n\n\nprimary and secondary spacecraft are in quasi-circular\norbits, with similar semi-major axis, inclination and\nascending node. George William Hill (1838\u20131914) first\nderived the relative equations of motion using these\nassumptions in 1877 within the context of celestial\nmechanics [30]; they were subsequently re-derived by W.\nH. Clohessy and R. S. Wiltshire of The Martin Company in\n1960 within the context of astrodynamics [31]. Although\nderived in the satellite-based Gaussian, or RSW coordinate\nsystem, the Clohessy\u2013Wiltshire equations of motion (also\ncalled Hill\u2019s Equations, or Hill\u2013Clohessy\u2013Wiltshire Equa-\ntions) are typically mapped directly onto an xyz notation to\nreinforce and evoke the approximate nature of the solutions\ngiven. The Clohessy\u2013Wiltshire equations of motion are\n\n\u20acx? 2x _y? 3x2x \u00bc fx \u00f04:157\u00de\n\n\u20acy\u00fe 2x _x \u00bc fy \u00f04:158\u00de\n\n\u20acz\u00fe x2z \u00bc fz \u00f04:159\u00de\n\nwhere the angular term x \t dh=dt\u00f0 \u00de is, by definition, the\nprimary spacecraft\u2019s mean motion. Note that whilst the\nrelative vector, rrel, from the primary spacecraft to the\nsecondary spacecraft was assumed to be small, the along-\ntrack range, y, does not appear in the Clohessy\u2013Wiltshire\nequations of motion and is thus not directly restricted.\n\nAlternative forms of the relative equations of motion can\nbe found which are valid for a range of eccentricities; see\n[1, 32\u201334]. Further, significant errors, perhaps as much as\n10 % for e = 0.05, can be found to accumulate for non-\ncircular orbits when using the Clohessy\u2013Wiltshire equations\nof motion.\n\nTo solve the Clohessy\u2013Wiltshire equations of motion it\nis usual to assume that no external forces act on the sec-\nondary spacecraft, that is F \u00bc 0 0 0\u00bd ?. This prohibits the\nanalysis of continuous low-thrust maneuvers, but impulsive\nmaneuvers can be treated by using the resultant velocities to\ndefine a new initial condition state. Noting the coupling\nbetween Eqs. 4.157 and 4.158 (in-plane motion), that\nEq. 4.159 is a decoupled, simple harmonic oscillator (out-\nof-plane motion), the Clohessy\u2013Wiltshire equations of\nmotion can be solved using Laplace transformations as\n\nx t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 4x0 \u00fe\n2 _y0\nx\n\n? ?\n\u00fe _x0\n\nx\nsin xt\u00f0 \u00de ? 3x0 \u00fe\n\n2 _y0\nx\n\n? ?\ncos xt\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00f04:160\u00de\n\ny t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc y0 ?\n2 _x0\nx\n\n? ?\n\u00fe 2 _x0\n\nx\ncos xt\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe 6x0 \u00fe\n\n4 _y0\nx\n\n? ?\nsin xt\u00f0 \u00de\n\n? 6xx0 \u00fe 3 _y0\u00f0 \u00det\n\u00f04:161\u00de\n\nz t\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc z0 cos xt\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe\n_z0\nx\n\nsin xt\u00f0 \u00de \u00f04:162\u00de\n\nwhere\n\n_x\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 3xx0 \u00fe 2 _y0\u00f0 \u00de sin xt\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe _x0 cos xt\u00f0 \u00de \u00f04:163\u00de\n\n_y\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 6xx0 \u00fe 4 _y0\u00f0 \u00de cos xt\u00f0 \u00de ? 2 _x0 sin xt\u00f0 \u00de ? 6xx0 \u00fe 3 _y0\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00f04:164\u00de\n\n_z\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc _z0 cos xt\u00f0 \u00de ? z0x sin xt\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f04:165\u00de\n\nThe application of the Clohessy\u2013Wiltshire equations of\nmotion will be discussed further in Chap. 12.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Macdonald\n\n\n\n5Introduction to Atmospheric Transit\nRichard Brown, Tom Scanlon and Jason Reese\n\nThis chapter introduces the historical and technical back-\nground to the technology that is required for entry, whether\nfrom orbit or beyond, into the atmosphere of the various\ncelestial bodies within our solar system. It opens with a\nhistorical description of the forms of atmospheric entry\ntechnology that have been employed on various missions to\ndate. The physical constraints on the design of atmospheric\nentry vehicles are then described in broad terms. The\natmospheric properties of the various near-Earth planets are\nthen described: these properties have distinct bearing on the\ntype of technology that is appropriate for any particular\nmission. Following a discussion of the range of modern\ncomputational techniques that exist for dealing with the\nvery difficult problem of simulating the behavior of atmo-\nspheric entry vehicles, the chapter closes with a short per-\nspective on future developments in the field.\n\n5.1 Short History of Missions\n\n5.1.1 Mercury\n\nAlthough several probes have been sent on flyby missions,\nand the NASA MESSENGER probe is currently in orbit, no\ncraft to date has landed on Mercury\u2019s surface. It is of note\nthat the envisaged lander element of the ESA/JAXA Bepi-\nColombo mission was removed early on in the mission\ndesign cycle due to the evident significant difficulties of that\ntask. Indeed it is indicative of the difficulties of landing on a\n\nplanet with negligible atmosphere that, as envisioned,\nchemical thrusters would have been required during the\ndescent sequence to provide the requisite deceleration for\nthis probe to have reached the surface intact.\n\n5.1.2 Venus\n\nThe Soviet Venera-3 (Russian: Beyepa-3) holds the honor of\nbeing the first probe to impact on the surface of another\nplanet. This occurred on March 1, 1966. Unfortunately, as a\nresult of a catastrophic early failure of its data capture sys-\ntem, the probe failed to provide any information during its\ndescent. The subsequent Venera-4, -5 and -6 missions\n(1967\u20131969) survived down to a short distance from the\nsurface of Venus, falling silent at *20 km altitude, and\nmanaged to transmit valuable quantities of measured data\nbefore being crushed by the pressure of the Venusian atmo-\nsphere. Given the experiences with the earlier probes in the\nseries, Venera-7 was substantially redesigned to withstand\nthe pressures of 75\u2013100 Earth atmospheres, which it was\nrealized it would be subjected to on the surface of Venus.\nDespite a last-second failure of its parachute system, on\nDecember 15, 1970 it became the first vehicle to land on the\nsurface of another planet. The probe continued to transmit\ninformation from the Venusian surface for 23 min before\nexhausting its batteries. Venera-8 to -14 (1972\u20131982) were\nall more or less successful, and returned significant amounts\nof atmospheric data as well as seismic and spectrographic\ninformation regarding the planet and its composition. In\n1985, the Vega-1 and -2 probes culminated the Soviet\nexploration of Venus by deploying balloon-suspended\ninstrumentation packages to explore the Venusian atmo-\nsphere. These devices floated in the atmosphere for about\n46 h and revealed the clouds in the most active layer about\n54 km above the surface to contain significant quantities of\nacid-rain, producing sulphuric acid. Although the explora-\ntion of Venus has largely been a Soviet affair, the US Pioneer\n\nR. Brown (&) ? T.

Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014\n\n99\n\n\n\nVenus Multi-probe mission (1978) has also made a signifi-\ncant contribution to understanding of the Venusian atmo-\nsphere. As part of the mission, four atmospheric probes were\ntargeted individually at the equator, the higher latitudes, and\nat the day and night sides of the planet\u2014the day-side probe\nreached the surface and continued to transmit data for over an\nhour. Three of the probes were equipped with a nephelometer\nand temperature, pressure, and acceleration sensors, as well\nas a radiometer to map the distribution of radiative energy in\nthe atmosphere. The larger, equatorial probe was equipped,\nin addition, with spectrometers to measure the atmospheric\ncomposition. The Doppler shift of the radio signals from all\nfour probes were also used to characterize the winds and\nturbulence levels in the atmosphere.\n\n5.1.3 Mars\n\nMissions to the surface of Mars have been bedeviled by a\nlong history of failures\u2014if anything this is an indication of\nhow difficult the Martian environment is to penetrate. The\ndifficulties are well expressed by Braun and Manning [1]\nwho show that, in strong contrast to the situation on Venus,\nthe principal difficulty is to define a trajectory through the\nthin Martian atmosphere that will provide sufficient aero-\ndynamic deceleration of the entry vehicle before the inev-\nitable contact with the planetary surface. To date all\nsuccessful missions have involved entry vehicles that have\nbeen sufficiently lightweight to meet very stringent bounds\non their allowable ballistic coefficient, and all have been\nforced to be targeted at landing sites that were well below\nthe mean surface level of the planet in order to exploit\n\u2018more\u2019 atmosphere. The first mission that was intended to\nenter the Martian atmosphere was the Soviet Mars 1962B\nprobe\u2014this mission failed before leaving Earth orbit. A\ndozen or so subsequent missions experienced various fail-\nures that prevented them from reaching Mars. In the early\n1970s, however, the Soviet Mars-3 Lander (1971) and\nMars-6 Lander (1974) managed to enter the Martian\natmosphere but lost contact shortly thereafter. The NASA\nViking-1 mission in 1976 achieved the first successful\nlanding, returning images from the surface of planet, fol-\nlowed by the Viking-2 mission later in the same year. The\nMars Pathfinder mission in 1997, followed by the Mars\nExploration Rover mission in 2003 and the Mars Science\nLaboratory mission in 2012, all successfully landed rovers\non the Red Planet. NASA\u2019s Phoenix mission resulted in the\nfirst successful landing of a probe in the polar regions of\nMars in 2008, with the aim of finding evidence of water and\nexploring the possibility of microbial life. Finally, there are\nambitious long-term plans to send humans to Mars, together\nwith the infrastructure that is required to support explora-\ntion of the surface for months or even years. The task of\n\nlanding the habitation modules (currently envisaged as\nhaving a mass of around 40 tons each) on the surface of\nMars will pose significant challenges to the current gener-\nation of atmospheric penetration technology, and is stimu-\nlating research into novel heat shield materials as well as\ninto the design of very large decelerators that will be\nstowable during transit and deploy only on entry into the\nMartian atmosphere.\n\n5.1.4 The Gas Planets\n\nIn July 1995 an atmospheric entry vehicle was detached\nfrom the NASA/DLR Galileo spacecraft as it neared the\nJovian system. The probe experienced accelerations of up to\n230 G, and its warhead-style ablative heat shield was esti-\nmated to have lost about 80 kg of its 152 kg total mass\nduring its subsequent passage into the atmosphere of Jupi-\nter. Suspended by a parachute, the probe continued to\ntransmit data for 58 min during which it descended 150 km\ninto the atmosphere before failing once the ambient pres-\nsure reached 23 Earth atmospheres. Finally, on September\n21, 2003, after 14 years in space and 8 years of observation\nof Jupiter and its moons, the mission of the Galileo space-\ncraft itself was brought to a close by sending it into Jupiter\u2019s\natmosphere. The primary reason for this terminal maneuver,\nthough, was to avoid any chance of the craft eventually\ncolliding with one of the Jovian moons and contaminating it\nwith bacteria from Earth, and no useful scientific data was\ngathered during the process.\n\nNo probe has ever entered the atmosphere of Saturn. On\nDecember 25, 2004, however, the ESA Huygens probe, part\nof the joint NASA/ESA Cassini-Huygens mission, entered\nthe atmosphere of Saturn\u2019s largest moon Titan\u2014the only\nnatural satellite in the solar system known to have a dense\natmosphere. While parachuting down to the surface, the\nprobe relayed data regarding the physical and chemical\ncomposition of the atmosphere, as well as photographs of\nthe surface of the satellite. The atmospheres of the two\nfurthest planets from the Sun, Neptune and Uranus, have\nalso yet to be penetrated by spacecraft.\n\n5.1.5 Earth Atmosphere Reentry\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, ballistic missiles\nand the associated reentry vehicle technology that was\nrequired to protect their thermonuclear warhead(s) during\nthe final stages of an attack were vigorously developed on\nboth sides of the so-called Iron Curtain. The technology\nassociated with these entry vehicles remains largely clas-\nsified except for some of the very earliest designs\u2014which\nthese days can even be visited in museums. The earliest\n\n100 R. Brown et al.\n\n\n\ncivil reentry vehicle designs were derivatives of this tech-\nnology. NASA\u2019s Project Mercury (1959\u20131963), Gemini\n(1962\u20131966) and early Apollo program (1966\u20131968), along\nwith the Soviet Vostok (Russian: BocTor) (1961\u20131963) and\nVoskhod (Russian: Bocx\u00f3l) (1964, 1965) missions pio-\nneered the return from near space during the early days of\nhuman space exploration, employing a combination of\nablative and heat-sink technology. Later crewed missions to\nthe Moon (Apollo 1968\u20131972) involved a far more ener-\ngetic return but used a derivative of the ablative heat shield\ntechnology used in the earlier missions. The proposed\nNASA/ESA Mars Sample Return Mission would pose an\ninteresting problem because of its even more energetic\nreturn than Apollo, but advances in ablator materials tech-\nnology in the half-century or so since the first missions to\nthe Moon have been dramatic. In that vein, also worthy of\nnote is the JAXA Hayabusa spacecraft that rendezvoused\nwith a small near-Earth asteroid, called 25143 Itokawa, in\nmid-September 2005. On 13 June 2010 a small reentry\nvehicle survived the return of the main craft into the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere and was recovered, together with its cargo of a\nsample of the asteroid\u2019s surface material, from its landing\nsite at Woomera, Australia. This followed NASA\u2019s very\nsuccessful Stardust mission which returned debris collected\nduring its passage through the coma of the comet Wild-2 to\nEarth on January 15, 2006. Its advanced Phenolic Impreg-\nnated Carbon Ablator (PICA) heat shield allowed the\nsample container to survive a peak deceleration of about\n25 G and heating rates approximately 30 times those\nexperienced by the Apollo reentry vehicle.\n\nBy far the most intense activity requiring reentry into the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere from orbit was associated with the early\ngeneration of reconnaissance and surveillance satellites.\nContrary to modern practice, where images are transmitted\nback to Earth, in the early days exposed film was returned to\nthe surface contained within purpose-designed reentry\ncapsules. It is of note that although this practice continued,\nin a limited form, beyond 2010, exact details within the\npublic domain are limited. Some of the larger satellites\nwould be launched with several of these capsules on board\nfor the purpose of returning film at various stages during the\nmission. The US Corona system alone had 163 (declassi-\nfied) recoveries each involving entry into the atmosphere\nand subsequent recovery of a film capsule. By far the largest\nproportion of human space activity involving the need for\nreentry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere since the 1970s has\nbeen associated with crew transfer to and from the Salyut,\nSkylab, Mir, and International Space Station, ISS. Apart\nfrom the transfers to and from Mir and the ISS using the\nSpace Shuttle (see later) all the reentry vehicles proposed\nfor these missions are characterized by their blunt-body\naerodynamics (see later). This philosophy relies on the\ngeneration of significant forces parallel to the direction of\n\nmotion as a result of aerodynamic drag to provide the\nbraking during atmospheric entry and often, but not always,\na significant proportion of the subsequent descent. In\ncomparison, the transverse forces that are required to\nmaneuver or extend the trajectory are kept relatively small\n(although not necessarily negligible or un-exploited).\n\nThe modifications to the characteristics of atmospheric\nreentry and descent that can be achieved by exploiting the\ncapability of suitably shaped bodies to generate significant\naerodynamic lift (also see later) have been explored in a\nrange of studies (e.g. the US Air Force Dyna-Soar, ESA\nHermes, and JAXA HOPE programs). A number of flight\narticles have been built and tested (e.g. the US PRIME\u2014\nPrecision Recovery Including Maneuvering Entry and\nASSET\u2014Aerothermodynamic Elastic Structural Systems\nEnvironmental Test, and the Soviet BOR series of sub-scale\nresearch vehicles), and the technology has been embodied\noperationally in the NASA Space Shuttle Orbiter\n(1981\u20132011), the Soviet Buran (which made a single orbital\nflight under autonomous control in November 1988), and the\nBoeing X-37 (also known as the X-37 Orbital Test Vehicle)\noperated by the United States Air Force for orbital space\nflight missions. Future applications of lifting-body reentry\ntechnology may be to the ESA/NASA Crew Return Vehicle\n(a development of 1970s lifting-body research) and JAXA\u2019s\nHyflex, but progress has been sporadic at best and, given the\nvagaries of funding for the development of such technology,\nthere have been many false starts. Notable mention should\nalso be made of the Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne and\nsubsequent series of suborbital vehicles, developed as part of\na private venture to take passengers to the edge of space.\nReturn to the earth of these vehicles is, thermally-speaking,\nrelatively benign since the energy that needs to be dissipated\nis some two orders of magnitude smaller than that required\nto be dissipated by a craft that is returning from even low\nEarth orbit. Thus, for these suborbital vehicles, atmospheric\nreentry can be achieved using simple, relatively low-per-\nformance atmospheric penetration technology in which the\nregions of the vehicle that are potentially thermally-sensitive\nare painted with a thin layer of ablative material.\n\nThe difficulties in creating a vehicle that is capable of\nrepeated lifting entry from orbit into the planetary atmo-\nsphere are ably demonstrated by the US Space Shuttle. The\norbiter vehicle relied on a winged glide-return following\nreentry from Earth orbit at a high angle of attack. The\nintention that the vehicle be capable of multiple returns into\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere posed severe constraints on the design\nof the thermal protection system (TPS) for the orbiter\nvehicle. Reinforced carbon\u2013carbon was used to cover the\nareas exposed to the greatest heating (the nose and wing\nleading edges), while innovative (but fragile) silica-based\nlow-conductivity tiles were used in areas subjected to\nintermediate heat loads (principally on the underside of the\n\n5 Introduction to Atmospheric Transit 101\n\n\n\nvehicle). Silica or Nomex blanket material covered heat-\nsensitive areas on the sides and upper rear fuselage. As\noperational experience with the vehicle was gained, the\ncomposition and distribution of the heat shield materials\nevolved, but the underlying structure was still of aluminum\nand is similar in design to that of an aircraft. The first return\nof the orbiter vehicle from orbit (STS-1 on April 12, 1981)\nwas accompanied by significant concerns that a number of\nmissing or damaged silica tiles on the lower-surface TPS\nmight lead to loss of the vehicle on reentry. Fortunately\ncatastrophe was averted and Columbia\u2019s two test pilots\nreturned safely to Earth on that occasion. Twenty-three\nsuccessful missions ensued until Challenger was lost on\nJanuary 28, 1986, for reasons largely unrelated to the sub-\nject matter of this chapter. A further 87 successful missions\nfollowed return of the Shuttle to flight on September 29,\n1988. Then, on January 16, 2003, Columbia\u2019s TPS was\ndamaged by a fragment of foam insulation shed from the\nexternal fuel tank during launch. As it reentered the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere 2 weeks later, high-temperature air penetrated\nthrough the TPS into the aluminum structure of the vehicle\nthrough a hole in the leading edge of the left wing, causing a\ncatastrophic high-altitude breakup of the vehicle. Although\nanother 22 successful flights eventually followed the loss of\nColumbia, the Shuttle system never achieved its projected\noperational capability and has since been retired. Indeed,\nthe entire US launch capability has reverted to traditional\nexpendable launch vehicle technology, and, apart from the\nclassified X-37 series of craft, makes use of conventional\nlow-lift reentry vehicle technology.\n\n5.2 Justification of Interest in Reentry\nAerodynamics\n\nThe initial conditions for atmospheric entry are provided\neither by the entry corridor that permits capture of the\nvehicle from an interplanetary trajectory or, more simply if\nthe ascending craft is already in a stabilized orbit, simply by\nthe dynamic state of the vehicle post the de-orbit burn.\nEntry into the planetary atmosphere must take place fol-\nlowing a carefully controlled relationship between speed\nand altitude to maintain the structural loads on the various\ncomponents of the vehicle (and of course the loads on the\noccupants if the vehicle is crewed) and its temperature\nwithin design tolerances. The various possible atmospheric\nentry modes are shown in Fig. 5.1.\n\nThe ballistic trajectory is employed by entry vehicles\nthat are incapable of generating significant lift, and the point\nof eventual impact of the vehicle with the planetary surface\nis essentially determined by the vehicle\u2019s dynamic condi-\ntion at entry into the atmosphere. The glide trajectory is\navailable to vehicles that have been specifically designed to\n\nproduce significant lift during entry, allowing the vehicle\nsome flexibility in terms of the eventual landing site on the\nplanetary surface. The skip trajectory allows a relatively\ngradual descent into the atmosphere via a series of relatively\nbrief exposures to the rigors of the thermal environment\nassociated with entry. Nevertheless, the integrated thermal\nload on the vehicle (see later) can be so great using this\nmode of entry as to preclude its use unless some method of\nrapidly dissipating the thermal energy from the vehicle can\nbe arranged. Aerobraking maneuvers are an alternative\nmeans of achieving capture into a planetary orbit; in many\nways this can be considered as a special case of the skip\ntrajectory. See Chap. 4 for some further discussion of aer-\nobraking. The entry trajectory of the vehicle is thus almost\nexclusively governed by its aerodynamic characteristics.\nThe importance of the aerodynamic forces acting on an\nentry vehicle relative to gravitational forces is expressed\ncrudely by the ballistic coefficient B \u00bc m=\u00f0CDS\u00de for a\nnon-lifting entry (where m is the vehicle mass, and S is the\nreference area for the vehicle\u2019s drag coefficient CD), and by\nL \u00bc B=\u00f0CL=CD\u00de for an entry vehicle that is capable of\ngenerating significant lift (CL is the vehicle\u2019s lift coeffi-\ncient\u2014see Fig. 5.2). The effect of these parameters on the\nsubsequent trajectory of the entry vehicle is shown in Fig.\n5.3. Vehicles with a low L or B tend to decelerate at higher\naltitudes within the atmosphere than those with low. This\ndistinction is important when the aerodynamics of the\nvehicle is coupled to thermal characteristics of vehicle, as is\ndescribed in more detail below.\n\nFig. 5.1 The various possible atmospheric reentry modes. a Ballistic.\nb Glide c Skip\n\n102 R. Brown et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\n5.2.1 Performance and Stability Implications\n\nFor lifting vehicles (even the blunt Apollo capsule was\ncapable of generating useful force perpendicular to its\ndirection of motion) the lift-to-drag ratio influences the\nvariation in range that is achievable both along and trans-\nverse to the trajectory of the vehicle. In the hypersonic flight\nregime (specifically, when the Mach number is greater than\nabout five), the lift-to-drag ratio of any aerodynamic body is\nrelatively low. As shown in Fig. 5.4, values of CL=CD\ngreater than 7 or 8 are difficult to achieve except possibly\nfor waverider-type vehicles. Although the term \u2018waverider\u2019\nhas been misappropriated of late to apply to a broader range\nof hypersonic lifting vehicles, they remain largely theoret-\nical constructs.\n\nIn practice Kuchemann\u2019s correlation \u00f0CL=CD\u00demax \u00bc\n4\u00f0M \u00fe 3\u00de=M; shown in Fig. 5.4, is a useful rule of thumb but\n\nit should kept in mind that most practical vehicles have sig-\nnificantly lower CL=CD than predicted by this relationship.\nEven in the low-speed terminal flight phase, the lift-to-drag\nratios of winged entry vehicles tend to be rather low given the\nrequirement that the vehicles be slender and have relatively\nlow aspect ratio wings in order to have good supersonic\nperformance. For this reason, unpowered lifting vehicles\nsuch as the Space Shuttle Orbiter are capable of only rela-\ntively small lateral deviations, of the order of 2,000 km from\ntheir nominal entry trajectory (for instance as might be\nrequired to reach an alternate landing site). The integration of\natmospheric-fed propulsion systems that would allow greater\ncross-range capability into the design of winged entry vehi-\ncles is an entire subject in its own right, however. For most\nentry vehicles, the drag coefficient is the most important\nparameter influencing their performance. Figure 5.5 shows\nthe variation of this coefficient as a function of Mach number\n\nFig. 5.2 Force and moment\ncoefficients as conventionally\ndefined for an aerospace vehicle.\nAll forces are non-\ndimensionalised by 1/2q (U?)\n\n2S\nand moments by 1/2q (U?)\n\n2Sl\n\nFig. 5.3 Comparison between\nlifting and ballistic entry paths on\nthe velocity-altitude map\n\n5 Introduction to Atmospheric Transit 103\n\n\n\nfor a sphere and for a cylinder with a conical nose and sug-\ngests that, although the drag coefficient of any blunt, non-\nlifting entry vehicle would be dependent on its shape, it might\nnot in fact be very sensitive to the actual Mach number of\nflight once in the hypersonic regime. This observation sim-\nplifies considerably the process of calculating the ballistic\ncoefficient of the vehicle during those parts of the entry tra-\njectory where the effects of heating are the most important.\n\nThe inherent stability of the vehicle during atmospheric\nentry is also a serious consideration. Without inherent sta-\nbility an entry vehicle might tumble, thus interfering with\nlater parachute deployment for instance, or adopt an attitude\nduring entry in which its thermal protection system is\nineffective. For all vehicles the first essential requirement\nfor stability of the vehicle is that it should be able to attain\nan equilibrium attitude, in other words one in which all\nthree components of the aerodynamic moment (pitch, roll\nand yaw) about the center of mass of the vehicle are zero.\nStabilization of a non-lifting entry vehicle at a particular\nspeed for a given altitude is usually assured by the fact that\nthe increasing dynamic pressure associated with an\n\nacceleration of the vehicle acts to increase the drag on the\nvehicle and hence to counteract the acceleration. The sta-\nbility of non-lifting entry vehicles is thus primarily gov-\nerned by the pitching and yawing moment derivatives with\nrespect to attitude and rate of change of attitude; note that\nfor an axially symmetric vehicle the pitching and yawing\nderivatives are generally very similar. Stability is generally\nassured if the (spring) derivatives oCM=oa and oCN=ob and\nthe (damping) derivatives oCM=oq and oCN=or are selected\nto all lie in the design space that yields both a restorative\nmoment and suppression of any oscillations following a\nperturbation of the vehicle from its equilibrium attitude (see\nFig. 5.2). Stability in roll is often very difficult to achieve\nfor entry vehicles that are close to being axially symmetric.\nThis is because the roll moment derivatives are usually\nclose to zero. This can have consequences for the design of\nparachute systems and retro-rockets intended for the final\nstages of descent, but can be exploited to allow spin-sta-\nbilization of the attitude of the vehicle. For a lifting vehicle\nthe roll stability is affected by a similar pair of derivatives\nof the rolling moment, and there is a significant possibility\nof aerodynamic and inertial coupling between the roll, pitch\nand yaw degrees of freedom, especially given the slender-\nness of most lifting entry vehicles alluded to earlier. This\ncoupling can yield an oscillatory instability that couples the\nyaw and roll of the vehicle into a mode known as Dutch\nRoll, or even to a rapid divergence in pitch or yaw attitude\nunder certain flight conditions. Coupling of the dynamics of\nthe vehicle with the atmospheric density fluctuations that\nare found at high altitude near the fringes of space can lead\nto an oscillatory instability in the coupled speed-pitch-alti-\ntude mode of the vehicle known as the Phugoid. There are\nsignificant contributions to all the aerodynamic forces and\ntheir derivatives from viscous, real gas and rarefaction\neffects, and these are not easy to estimate accurately during\nthe design of a vehicle. Later in this chapter these predictive\ndifficulties are discussed in more detail with application to\nthe Stardust sample return capsule, and to the Shuttle\nOrbiter, where significant problems were encountered in\nmatching practice with design as far as vehicle stability was\nconcerned.\n\n5.2.2 Thermal Implications\n\nThe aerodynamic and the thermal characteristics of the\nvehicle are closely coupled, particularly at the hypersonic\nspeeds that are typical of the early stages of atmospheric\nentry. The intense friction generated at the surface of the\nvehicle is the prime source of heating, and the relative\nimportance of the thermal energy imparted to the vehicle\nsurface by friction, and the energy removed from, or\nimparted to, the surface by conduction in the gas is given by\n\nFig. 5.4 Variation with Mach number of maximum lift to drag ratio\nof entry vehicles. Open circles represent historic test data [2]\n\nFig. 5.5 Values of the drag coefficient for a sphere and for a cylinder\nwith a conical nose [3]. The values do not change appreciably after\nM = 4\n\n104 R. Brown et al.\n\n\n\nthe Prandtl number Pr \u00bc Cpl=k where Cp is the specific\nheat of the gas at constant pressure, l is its dynamic vis-\ncosity and k is its thermal conductivity. As such the Prandtl\nnumber is principally a property of the gas, and for air has a\nvalue between 0.7 and 0.8. The deceleration of the gas in\nthe boundary layer near the surface of the vehicle, and\nthrough the system of shock waves that is produced in the\nflow surrounding the vehicle results in very high gas tem-\nperatures. Under these conditions, it is quite possible that\nsome of the energy of the gas molecules is then redistrib-\nuted, through molecular collisions, from being purely\nkinetic (as in an ideal gas) to various forms of internal\nenergy such as vibration and dissociation. Figure 5.6 shows\nthe various chemical effects that can, in addition, be expe-\nrienced by the vehicle at various heights and altitudes\nduring entry to Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Changes in the chem-\nical composition of the gas surrounding the entry vehicle\nhave a significant effect on its thermodynamics, and thus on\nthe thermal transfer to the vehicle, as well as on the dis-\ntribution of forces on its surface.\n\nThe rate of heat transfer to the vehicle is also influenced\nstrongly by whether the flow over the vehicle is laminar or\nturbulent. Laminar-turbulent transition is delayed at high\naltitude, as shown in Fig. 5.7, principally due to rarefied\n\nflow effects. Indeed, the effective Reynolds number of the\nvehicle can be estimated fairly readily using the ideal gas\n\nrelationship Re \u00bc \u00f0M=Kn\u00de\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\ncp=2\n\np\nwhere M is the Mach\n\nnumber at which the vehicle is flying, c is the ratio of\nspecific heats of the gas in the flow around the vehicle, and\nthe Knudsen number, Kn, introduced in Chap. 4 is the ratio\nbetween the molecular free path and the length-scale that\nbest characterizes the vehicle (see the detailed discussion\nlater in this chapter). This relationship needs to be treated\nwith extreme care, however, since even at altitudes where\nthe flow as predicted by this formula is ostensibly laminar,\nlocal protuberances (e.g. as caused by localized damage to\nthe surface) can trip the boundary layer, creating zones of\nelevated heat transfer downstream; see Fig. 5.8 for instance,\nwhich shows a swath of excess heating on the underside of\nthe Shuttle, resulting from local tripping of the boundary\nlayer caused by localised roughness, possibly damage to\none of the TPS tiles, on the forward starboard side of the\nvehicle. The likely location, even occurrence, of these\nmicro-scale effects is notoriously difficult to predict and can\nforce the designer to approach the specification of the\nvehicle\u2019s thermal protection system with a conservatism\nthat is disproportionate compared to that which is applied to\nthe remainder of the vehicle.\n\nFig. 5.6 Velocity-altitude map,\nwith superimposed zones in\nwhich various chemical or real-\ngas effects become important [4]\n\nFig. 5.7 Velocity-altitude map,\nwith superimposed lines of\nconstant unit Reynolds number\n(Re/l)\n\n5 Introduction to Atmospheric Transit 105\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nRadiative heat transfer can also be a very important\ncontributor to the thermal load on the vehicle, and is\ninfluenced by the surface condition of the vehicle, the state\nof the gas in which it is immersed (particularly with respect\nto its own radiative or absorptive properties), and whether\nor not other hot surfaces on the vehicle are exposed to the\nregion under consideration via a direct optical path. For this\nreason concave portions of the vehicle (e.g. wing fuselage\njunctions, or the inwards-facing faces of fins) can be subject\nto much higher thermal loads than if just convective or\nconductive processes were involved.\n\nThe thermal transfer to the surface of the craft is affected\nvery strongly by the surface roughness and chemistry,\nincluding the presence of catalytic reactions between the\nsurface material and the constituents of the gas layer above\nthe surface, and the presence near the surface of the\nchemical products of the decomposition of ablative shield-\ning, should it be employed in the TPS of the craft. The\nReynolds analogy is often exploited to relate the local heat\ntransfer to the local skin friction. This empirical law holds\nthat the rate of thermal transfer to the vehicle surface is\ndirectly proportional to the shear stress that the gas imposes\non the surface, but such simple concepts break down at high\naltitudes and speeds as rarefied gas effects become more\nimportant (see later). The structure of the shock layer that\nprecedes the vehicle at all supersonic Mach numbers has a\nprofound effect on the heating rate at its forward extremi-\nties. This leads most entry vehicles to have a very blunt\ndesign in order to maximize the stand-off distance of the\nshock layer and thus to reduce the instantaneous thermal\nload on the vehicle. Even those entry vehicles designed to\nproduce significant lift usually have blunt leading edges;\nthis is simply a compromise between the performance of the\nvehicle (particularly in terms of lift-to-drag ratio) and the\n\nlocal heating of the structure. Again, as altitude and speed\nincrease, real-gas (non-equilibrium) and rarefied gas effects\ncan complicate considerably the prediction of the structure\nof the shock layer and thus the thermal transfer to the\nvehicle (see later). Trajectory design for entry into a plan-\netary atmosphere is a careful balance between the maximum\ninstantaneous thermal and mechanical load on the vehicle\n(which has implications for the mechanical resilience of the\nsurface of the vehicle itself) against the total (integrated)\nthermal load that is transferred to the vehicle during its\ndescent. The design process involves iteration between the\ndesign of the trajectory in terms of speed versus altitude (as\ngoverned by the aerodynamics and hence the shape of the\nvehicle), the type of thermal protection system that is used,\nand the design of the remainder of the structure of the\nvehicle. A variety of thermal protection strategies can be\nused, from the more usual passive or ablative systems to\nactive systems where coolant material is ejected into the\nlayer immediately adjacent to the surface or circulated\nunderneath. The TPS must be carefully matched to the\nunderlying structure of the vehicle; for instance, conduction\nfrom the thermal protection system into the underlying\nstructure can cause the temperature within the vehicle to\ncontinue to rise even after landing, in the worst instances\nleading to eventual destruction of the contents of the craft.\nFor this reason, and of course also to reduce the weight of\nthe system at touchdown, many atmospheric probes have\nejected their heat shield at some combination of speed and\naltitude before resorting to other means of slowing their\ndescent to the planetary surface.\n\n5.3 Characteristics of Planetary Upper\nAtmospheres\n\nThe characteristics of planetary atmospheres vary widely\nacross the solar system. The atmosphere of each planet\nconsists of a number of chemical species, the relative pro-\nportions of which vary with altitude. In this section only\nthose planets closest to the Sun are considered in any depth.\nThe closest three planets, namely Venus, Earth and Mars all\nconsist of a rocky, solid, approximately spherical surface\ncoated in a relatively thin layer of gas (atmosphere). On all\nthese planets, radiative interaction with the Sun is strong\nenough to drive the atmospheric circulation that is primarily\nresponsible for the distribution of weather (short-term\nvariations in the atmospheric state, dominated by Coriolis\nforces) and climate (variations on the scale of the orbital\nperiod and longer) over latitude and altitude.\n\nThe ability of planets such as Venus, Earth and Mars to\nretain their atmospheres reflects a competition between the\nthermal velocity and the escape velocity of the gas mole-\ncules. Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the\n\nFig. 5.8 Remote sensor image of the temperature distribution on the\nShuttle lower surface during reentry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere (red\nhottest, blue coldest). Note the asymmetry in the temperature\ndistribution that results from boundary layer tripping, produced by\nlocalized roughness, possibly as a result of damage to one of the TPS\ntiles, on the forward starboard side of the vehicle (STS-134) [5]. Image\nNASA\n\n106 R. Brown et al.\n\n\n\nouter edge of a planet\u2019s atmosphere to have their velocity\nincreased to the point where they can escape from the\nplanet\u2019s gravitational field. The magnetic field of the Earth\nis strong enough to divert the solar wind (a stream of\ncharged particles emanating from the Sun) away from the\nplanet and thus to prevent it from stripping away the\natmosphere. A schematic of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field can\nbe found in Chap. 3. Venus has no magnetic field, but\ninteractions between the solar wind and the ionosphere of\nthe planet protect its atmosphere to a significant extent. In\nsharp contrast, the magnetic field of the planet closest to the\nSun, Mercury, is not strong enough to have prevented the\natmosphere of that planet from being stripped away by the\nsolar wind. As a result, Mercury does not have anything\nmore than the most diffuse of atmospheres.\n\nThe planets furthest from the Sun (not including moons)\nare thought to be primarily gaseous in composition with\ntheir circulation being driven by internal processes that are\nnot completely understood. Known as the Jovian planets, or\ngas giants, they consist of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and\nNeptune, as shown in Fig. 5.9. In all cases, rapid planetary\nrotation plays a significant role in energy distribution and\nhence both weather and climate.\n\nAs discussed briefly in Chap. 4, topography in certain\ngeographical locations can rise to an appreciable portion of\nthe atmospheric thickness resulting in large-scale modifi-\ncations to the weather, due to deflection of winds and\ninterruptions to circulatory patterns, e.g. the Himalayas on\nEarth and the Olympus Mons volcano on Mars as shown in\nFig. 5.10 at Earth.\n\n5.3.1 Chemical Composition\n\nThe chemical composition of planetary atmospheres differs\nconsiderably. Venus has a very dense atmosphere with a\nsurface pressure 90 times that at the Earth\u2019s surface and a\nchemical composition of 96.4 % CO2 and 3.4 % N2 with\n\ntrace amounts of SO2 and water. The surface temperature is\n740 K due to the greenhouse effect of the large quantity of\nCO2. The atmospheric pressure on the surface of the Earth\naverages 101.325 kPa (1 atm), while the chemical compo-\nsition by number is 78 % N2 and 21 % O2 with trace\namounts of water vapor, argon, CO2 and other gaseous\nmolecules. The atmosphere on Mars is relatively thin (less\nthan 1 % by mass of that of Earth) with a chemical com-\nposition of 95 % CO2 and 2.7 % N2 while the typical\ntemperature ranges from 186 to 273 K. On Venus, Earth\nand Mars the pressure, density and temperature vary sig-\nnificantly with altitude. As discussed in Chap. 4, numerous\nmodels exist for calculating these parameters, and best--\npractice guides exist to the various available atmospheric\nmodels for the Earth and the other planets, see for instance\nthe AIAA Guide to Reference and Standard Atmosphere\nModels [6].\n\nOn Earth, the atmosphere is normally described in terms\nof a temperature variation as shown in Fig. 5.11. Two\nequations for pressure are normally applied, one when the\nstandard temperature lapse rate (the temperature gradient) is\nnot equal to zero and one when it is equal to zero.

This figure demonstrates how\nthe temperature profile near the surface of all the planets is\nstrongly influenced by convection, driven by radiative\nheating of the planetary surface by the Sun (exacerbated by\nthe greenhouse effect in the case of Venus), while at higher\naltitudes direct absorption of radiation is the principal\nheating mode.\n\n5.3.2 Weather\n\nIn general, the global circulation is driven by differential\nheating of the planetary surface at the poles and the equator.\nIn the case of Earth and Mars, the orientation of their\nrotational axis to orbital plane creates seasonal weather\npatterns.

Density\nvariations are primarily driven by hydrostatic equilibrium\nbut, at high altitudes, variations are large enough and of\nsufficiently long wavelength to interfere with spacecraft\nreentry trajectories, e.g. in the Shuttle Orbiter Approach and\nLanding Test, Free Flight 5, the wavelength of the vehicle\u2019s\ninherent Phugoid oscillatory motion was found to be of the\nsame order as density perturbations in the upper atmo-\nsphere, leading to issues with aerodynamic stability [7].\n\n5.4 Aerodynamics in the Upper\nAtmosphere\n\nThe flow surrounding a vehicle entering into a planetary\natmosphere at high speed contains a range of complex\nphysics, as shown in Fig. 5.12. Understanding the aero-\nthermodynamics of atmospheric entry vehicles is a major\nchallenge due to the combination of strong viscous effects,\nthe possibility of shock/body and shock/shock interactions\n(all resulting in very high local heating rates), rarefaction\nphenomena associated with rapid variations in density\nthrough the flow, and the real-gas effects (vibrational\nexcitation, dissociation and ionization) that result from the\nhigh temperature of the gas. Where an ablative TPS is used,\nadditional complications are introduced into the gas\nchemistry and the properties of the flow near the surface of\nthe vehicle, and indeed even the geometry and physical\ncondition of the surface of the vehicle may be subject to\nrapid changes.\n\nThe design of atmospheric entry vehicles thus relies on\nthree main approaches: (1) wind tunnel testing, (2) flight\nexperiments, and (3) modeling and simulation. Historically,\nthe wind tunnel has been the primary design tool, providing\norders of magnitude more data than the other techniques\ncombined. However, tests are costly and time consuming\n\nand usually do not fully replicate real operating and flow\nconditions. Flight experiments deliver authentic data relat-\ning to some real operating conditions, although not neces-\nsarily those of most interest to the designers; capture of\ngood data is difficult, and tests require meticulous and time\nconsuming planning, at considerable expense.\n\nThe most promising route for future developments is\nthrough modeling and simulation, and the use of compu-\ntational fluid dynamics (CFD), supported by wind tunnel\ntesting where appropriate in order to validate and confirm\nthe approach. The automotive and aircraft industries have\nalready replaced the majority of their wind tunnel tests with\nCFD and the aerospace industry is fast following suit. While\nCFD has the potential to be relatively even more useful for\naero-thermodynamic (high Mach number) flows than for\nlow\u2014because it can deliver data that cannot be measured or\nobserved, under conditions that cannot be reproduced in a\nlaboratory\u2014it still faces major challenges, especially if the\neffects of the substantial variations in the air density or\ncomposition along the trajectory of the vehicle are to be\nfully characterized.\n\nThe use of the conventional Navier\u2013Stokes\u2013Fourier\n(NSF) model for aero-thermodynamic simulations requires\nthat there is a strong separation between effects that occur\non the microscopic scale and those on the macroscopic\n(bulk flow) scale. It is axiomatic that the NSF equations\nmodel the gas as a continuum in local thermodynamic near-\nequilibrium. In practice, this requires heat and momentum\nto be equilibrated almost instantaneously throughout the\ngas. For a monatomic gas, the molecules need some three or\nfour collisions in order to equilibrate their (translational)\nenergy and momentum with surrounding molecules. As, at\nnormal temperatures and pressures, these molecules only\ntravel on average a few tens of nanometers before they\ncollide with another molecule, for most engineering systems\noperating at or near sea level the continuum description is\n\nFig. 5.12 Complex physics in\nthe flow field surrounding a\nspacecraft during atmospheric\nentry. Image NASA\n\n5 Introduction to Atmospheric Transit 109\n\n\n\nacceptable. Then linear stress/strain-rate (Newton\u2019s vis-\ncosity law) and heat-flux/temperature-gradient (Fourier\u2019s\nlaw) relationships can be assumed. However, at high alti-\ntude as the flow becomes more and more rarefied, the sit-\nuation is not always so clear-cut.\n\n5.4.1 The Knudsen Number and the Use\nof Bridging Functions for Rarefied Flows\n\nThe Knudsen number Kn is widely used as the decisive\nparameter to indicate the importance of rarefaction within a\nflow (as introduced in Chap. 4, classified into \u2018continuum\u2019,\n\u2018transition-continuum\u2019, or \u2018free-molecular\u2019 flow regimes). It\nis defined as the ratio of the mean free path of the gas\nmolecules in the local freestream, to a characteristic system\nlength-scale (such as the radius of curvature of the nose of\n\nthe vehicle), i.e. Kn \u00bc k=L where k / l=q\nffiffiffiffiffiffi\nRT\np\n\n; with l the\ngas dynamic viscosity, q its density, and T its temperature,\nall evaluated in the freestream. As the Knudsen number\nincreases, the non-continuum, particulate-like behavior of\nthe gas becomes ever more important. The continuum-fluid\nregime (in which conventional CFD modeling is applicable)\nholds up to Kn * 0.1, but for flows with 0.001 \\ Kn \\ 0.1\n(the \u2018slip regime\u2019), some modifications of the surface\nboundary conditions in the fluid model are required in order\nto incorporate non-equilibrium effects. In the transi-\ntion-continuum regime, 0.1 \\ Kn \\ 10, the fluid acts nei-\nther as a continuum nor as free-molecular, although at\nhigher Kn the flow can be described as free-molecular.\n\nAs an example, a reentry vehicle with a nose radius of\naround 10 cm encounters air at an altitude of 100 km with k\naround 1 cm, which corresponds to Kn * 0.1. Shock waves\nfrom Mach 3 to 11 typically have Kn * 0.2\u20130.3. These\nflows are therefore firmly in the transition-continuum\nregime. In most practical applications [8] a range of\nKnudsen number is encountered across different regions of\nthe flow, e.g. high Kn in the vicinity of bow shocks, sensors\nor inlets, and moderate-to-high Kn in the wake or base flow\ndownstream of the vehicle. Moreover, vehicles encounter a\nrange of Knudsen number as they descend through the\natmosphere owing to the variation in ambient air density.\nThe aerodynamic modeler needs to ascertain the range of\nKnudsen number in the flow of interest, before choosing the\nmost appropriate flow model (e.g. Navier\u2013Stokes\u2013Fourier,\nDirect-Simulation Monte Carlo, direct solution of the\nBoltzmann equation, etc.). The most modern aerodynamic\nmethods are able to switch between models in response to\nthese varying Kn conditions [9, 10].\n\nContinuum-fluid flow predictions can be accessed\nthrough the NSF equations. Free-molecular flows require\nonly the interaction of molecule fluxes with surfaces to be\n\naccounted for, often yielding analytical expressions for the\naerodynamic coefficients. The transition-continuum regime,\nhowever, poses great difficulties as neither the continuum\nfluid model not the free-molecular model is valid. The\ndifficulty in explicitly modeling this regime with accuracy\nhas led to the widespread use of \u2018bridging functions\u2019. These\nare correlations, many of which stem from experimental\nwork in the 1960s and 1970s, that are used to interpolate\nvalues of aerodynamic coefficients between the free-\nmolecular and continuum-fluid limits [11, 12]. Bridging\nfunctions are often used in aerodynamic analysis software\nto obtain transitional values of the axial force, normal force,\nand pitching moment coefficients, although other fluid\nparameters, such as the Stanton number (that measures the\nratio of the heat transferred into the gas to its thermal\ncapacity) can be modeled in this way too (see Fig. 5.13).\nHowever, it is important to realize that these functions are\nonly approximations to the actual flow behavior, and esti-\nmates of their inaccuracy range between 5 and 20 % [10].\nThere is no substitute for full-field aerodynamic simulations\nof hypersonic vehicles across the Kn range, and this is\nincreasingly possible due to the rapid development of high\nperformance (parallel) computing.\n\n5.4.2 A More Sensitive Indicator for High-speed\nRarefied Flow Conditions\n\nIt is clear that the traditional definition of the Knudsen\nnumber results in a flow parameter that is not of the same\nkind as the Mach number and Reynolds number: in fact it\nindicates whether the molecular nature of the gas affects the\nthermodynamic characteristics of the flow. For the purposes\nof classifying atmospheric entry aerodynamics, with a\nfreestream Mach number M1 and Reynolds number Re1; a\nmore sensitive indication of the flow rarefaction can be\nobtained through a term that quantifies, in non-dimensional\nform, the character of the molecular collision term in the\nBoltzmann equation [11], called the inverse Cheng\nparameter\n\nK?1c \u00bc C?M2=Re \u00f05:5\u00de\n\nwhere C \u00bc l?T=lT?; and l? \u00bc l\u00f0T?\u00de i.e. assuming a sim-\nple functional relationship between temperature and vis-\ncosity, and with T? the simple average of the temperature\nimmediately behind the normal bow shock and the tem-\nperature of the vehicle surface of interest. This parameter\nhas been shown to correlate the flight and wind tunnel data\nfor the axial force coefficient on the NASA Space Shuttle\nvery effectively, for instance [12]. A proper analysis of\nwhich fluid models should be used in which ranges of K?1c\nis still awaited, however.\n\n110 R. Brown et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\n5.5 Consequences of the Incorrect\nTreatment of the Aero-thermodynamics\n\nA rarefied flow is typically a thermodynamically, and often\nthermo-chemically, non-equilibrium flow. This is particu-\nlarly the case in the context of high-speed atmospheric\nentry. There are several well-known examples where the\nnon-equilibrium nature of the flow has strongly affected the\naerodynamic performance of the vehicle, and two of these\nare presented here as an illustration of the attention to detail\nrequired in the aerodynamic modeling of entry vehicles.\n\n5.5.1 Stardust\n\nThe Stardust atmospheric entry vehicle was part of a very\nambitious NASA program that successfully returned sam-\nples, collected from the coma of the comet Wild-2, to Earth\non January 15, 2006. An intensive program of computational\nanalysis was conducted to support the eventual success of\nthe mission, including free-molecular and Direct-Simulation\nMonte Carlo (DSMC) calculations of the capsule\u2019s aero-\nthermodynamics at the highest altitudes, the use of bridging\nfunctions in the transitional regime, and continuum Navier\u2013\nStokes in the lowest portions of the trajectory. These\nmethods, and their application to the design and develop-\nment of the Stardust capsule have been extensively docu-\nmented in the technical literature, forming a valuable\nresource to aid future practitioners. One of the major con-\ncerns during the design was that the craft should remain in a\nstable attitude as it passed through the upper, rarefied parts\nof the atmosphere, so that its ablative heat shield would be\npresented properly to the oncoming flow during the time\n\nover which the vehicle would experience its maximum\nheating. This was particularly important in this mission\ngiven that the PICA material used to construct the heat shield\nwas being tested for the first time in flight, and that the\nheating regime for this mission was particularly severe. In\nfact the Stardust sample-return capsule was at the time the\nfastest man-made object ever to enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere\n(traveling at 12.4 km/s or 28,000 mph at 135 km altitude).\n\nThe instability of planetary entry vehicles in the upper\natmosphere (i.e. in the free-molecular and transition\nregimes) is not uncommon. In these regimes, surface shear\nstress accounts for more than 80 % of the forces experi-\nenced by the vehicle, and some components of this force\ncan act to destabilize the vehicle [13]. Indeed, the Stardust\ncapsule was calculated to be statically unstable for Knudsen\nnumbers greater than 0.09, which, given the intended tra-\njectory, implied aerodynamic instability for all altitudes\nabove about 95 km. The capsule spin rate was thus designed\nso that the gyroscopic effect could be used to augment the\nstability of the capsule in the transition regime. It was\nrealized however that too high a spin rate could lead to too\nmuch stiffness in pitch at lower altitudes, with the vehicle\nthus entering the regime of peak heating at too high an\nangle of attack. Selection of a suitable spin rate was com-\nplicated by the very small rotational inertia of the vehicle\n[14]. Even at lower altitudes, where the gas is better\ndescribed as a continuum, the determination of the stability\nof the vehicle was complicated by real-gas effects, partic-\nularly by storage of energy in the vibrational modes of the\ngas, that significantly affected the position of the sonic line\non the vehicle and hence the distribution of pressure on its\nsurface. The changes in the shape of the heat shield that\nwere a natural consequence of the use of ablative materials\nin its design also had an important effect on the evolution of\nthe distribution of aerodynamic loads on the surface of the\ncraft as it descended through the atmosphere, and had to be\naccounted for in detail in assessing the best overall con-\nfiguration for the vehicle.\n\n5.5.2 Space Shuttle Orbiter\n\nIn the high Mach number, high altitude part of its first\nreentry, the Space Shuttle Orbiter experienced a nose-up\npitching moment that required the pilots to deflect the body-\nflap twice as much as they expected in order to restore trim\n(see Fig. 5.14). Explanations for this so-called \u2018pitching\nmoment anomaly\u2019 included unaccounted-for compressibil-\nity, viscous, and real-gas (high temperature) effects. Com-\npressibility and viscous effects were hypothesized because\nthe low Reynolds numbers occurring in high-altitude flight\nmean that the body-flap might not have been effective when\noperating within a thick boundary layer. High viscous shear\n\nFig. 5.13 Comparison of NASA\u2019s Object Reentry Survival Analysis\nTool (ORSAT) and ESA\u2019s Spacecraft Entry Survival Analysis Module\n(SESAM) transition-continuum bridging functions for flow stagnation\npoint Stanton number [9]\n\n5 Introduction to Atmospheric Transit 111\n\n\n\nof the cross flow in the nose region acting to induce nose-up\npitching moments was also proposed. However, later\nnumerical and experimental analysis [15] attributed the\nanomaly to high-temperature effects associated with the\nbow shock, leading to non-equilibrium and a lowering of\nthe specific heat ratio of the gas flowing over the vehicle.\nThis lower specific heat ratio caused pressures on the aft\nwindward expansion surface of the Orbiter to be lower than\nwas observed in the pre-flight hypersonic wind tunnel tests,\ngiven the inherent problems in matching true flight condi-\ntions, and in prior calculations which assumed ideal gas\nbehavior. Small errors in predicting the distribution of\npressure forces when integrated became a relatively sig-\nnificant error in the prediction of the pitching moment of the\nvehicle and thus on the deflection of the control surface that\nwas required to restore equilibrium.\n\n5.6 Simulating Aerodynamic Performance\n\n5.6.1 Pre-supercomputer Methodologies\n\nThe accurate estimation of the performance of an entry\nvehicle and its thermal load, particularly in the hypersonic\nand supersonic flight regimes, has always been an important\npre-requisite to successful mission design. In times prior to\nthe advent of powerful computers, a variety of approximate\nmethods were developed to achieve this task. Even today,\nthese methods fulfill an important need that still exists for\nmethods that can be used in the design context to estimate\nrapidly the aero-thermal characteristics of a given vehicle\nand to perform optimization and trade-off studies. The three\nmain approaches that fall into this category are\n\u2022 Extrapolation from known data using hypersonic simi-\n\nlarity laws\u2014The ideas of geometric and dynamic simi-\nlarity that apply so well in subsonic and supersonic flows\n\ncan be readily extended Into the hypersonic flow regime\nto allow the aerodynamic properties of a particular body\nto be extrapolated from the known properties of another.\nThis process is effective as long as the two bodies are\nrelated by the correct similarity parameters for the\nproblem at hand.\n\n\u2022 Component build-up methods\u2014In this class of approach,\nthe geometry of the vehicle is decomposed into an amal-\ngamation of simpler shapes, for instance spheres, cones\nand wedges, for which the flow properties can be calcu-\nlated using simple theory or empirical data. Historically\nthe most well-developed and readily available examples\nof this type of approach are the Douglas Aircraft Com-\npany series of Supersonic/Hypersonic Arbitrary Body\nPrograms (SHABP), development of which started in the\n1950s. In careful hands this approach can produce very\nreliable results, and indeed the preliminary design of the\nSpace Shuttle was achieved using this type of technique.\n\n\u2022 Simplified gas models\u2014A range of simplified theoretical\nmodels for high-speed gas flow around aerospace vehi-\ncles have been based on the assumption that at the highest\nspeeds, the random (thermal) motion of the gas particles\ncan be neglected compared to their translation at the\nmean velocity of the flow. The particles of the gas are\nthen modeled as traveling in straight lines before collid-\ning with the surface of the vehicle. During a collision, a\nparticle transfers momentum to the surface before\nrebounding, thus allowing the pressure on the surface to\nbe estimated. These so-called Newtonian methods can be\nenhanced in their accuracy by various means, including\ncorrelation with experimental data and augmentation with\nempirical correlations, to yield surprisingly effective\npredictions, despite their inherent simplicity, of the aero-\nmechanical and aero-thermal characteristics of modern\nentry vehicles.\n\n5.6.2 Modern Computational Methodologies\n\nAlthough it is known that the gas in the atmosphere is\ncomposed, at microscopic level, of discrete particles, a useful\napproximation arises if the particulate nature of the gas can\nbe suppressed and instead the atmosphere can be treated as a\ncontinuum. Indeed, the continuum approach, particularly\nthat through exploiting the Navier\u2013Stokes\u2013Fourier equa-\ntions, is at the root of many very successful approaches to\nmodeling the gas flow around aircraft and spacecraft, and\nyields good correlations with measured data over a wide\nrange of practically-relevant operational conditions [16].\n\nThe problem that the continuum Navier\u2013Stokes\u2013Fourier\nequations have in capturing the properties of a rarefied flow,\nhowever, are highlighted in Fig. 5.15. The normal shock is\na fundamental component of many high-speed aerodynamic\n\nFig. 5.14 The variation of the Shuttle Orbiter\u2019s actual body-flap\ndeflection required for trim during its first flight [12], compared to the\npredicted value from the Shuttle\u2019s Aerodynamic Design Data Book\n(ADDB) [13]\n\n112 R. Brown et al.\n\n\n\nflows, e.g. in the leading part of the bow shock in front of an\natmospheric entry vehicle. Rarefaction causes the shock to\nbe relatively thick (of the order of a few gas mean-free-\npaths, in other words of the same order as the stand-off\ndistance of the bow shock from the vehicle leading edge).\nFigure 5.15 shows that the Navier\u2013Stokes\u2013Fourier (NSF)\nequations consistently predict shocks in argon gas to be\nabout 50 % thinner than is observed experimentally. That\nthe fluid dynamic equations have such difficulty in pre-\ndicting the behavior in such a simple flow case, means that\ntheir validity in more complex rarefied flow-fields must also\nbe called into question.\n\nNon-continuum behavior can be accommodated to some\nextent in conventional continuum-based computational fluid\ndynamics (CFD) Navier\u2013Stokes\u2013Fourier approaches to\nmodeling the gas dynamics of aerospace vehicles, for\ninstance by incorporation of a finite slip velocity between the\ngas and any solid surfaces that are immersed within the flow\n[17]. A computationally efficient gas flow method, but one\nwhich has had only modest success to date, is to establish\neither a Kn-series or a Hermite polynomial approximation to\nthe distribution function in the Boltzmann equation, which\ngoverns the gas behavior at particle-kinetic level. To first\norder (i.e. for near-equilibrium flows) both approaches yield\nthe NSF set, but the solution methods can be continued to\nsecond and higher orders to incorporate more and more of\nthe salient characteristics of a rarefied flow. This family of\nso-called extended hydrodynamic equations has various\ndifferent members, including the Burnett, Grad 13-moment,\nR13, R26 equations, and others. Generally, however, these\nequation sets all have great difficulty in producing stable\nphysical solutions for high-Mach-number flows. Their non-\nlinearity also makes them difficult to solve numerically, and,\nas they are higher order in the gradients of flow properties,\ntheir solution requires additional boundary conditions that\n\nare not easy to define. For these reasons, extended hydro-\ndynamics has not established a firm place in the armory of\ntools that a high-speed aerodynamicist can deploy.\n\nIn highly rarefied environments \u00f0Kn [ 0:1\u00de accommo-\ndation of those non-continuum effects that occur in the flow\naway from surfaces remains a challenging problem. For this\nreason, analysis of gas flows in the non-continuum regime is\nmost naturally conducted using specialized computational\ntechniques that are derived from a statistical mechanical\nrepresentation of the behavior of the individual particles\ncomprising the flow. The most successful of these techniques\nis undoubtedly the Direct-Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)\napproach, originally proposed by Bird [18]. The DSMC\ntechnique allows particles to move and collide using kinetic\ntheory considerations that treat the non-continuum, non-\nequilibrium gas behavior accurately. DSMC considers\nmolecular collisions using stochastic rather than determin-\nistic procedures, and each DSMC simulator particle repre-\nsents a large number of real gas molecules. The decoupling of\nthe particle ballistic motion from the physics that takes place\nduring particle collisions improves the computational effi-\nciency of DSMC greatly in comparison with other particle\nmethods such as molecular dynamics (MD). As a result, the\nDSMC technique is becoming the dominant numerical\napproach for aerospace applications involving rarefied gas\nflows. Hypersonic vehicles which operate in rarefied gas\nenvironments may encounter chemically reacting flow con-\nditions that can have a significant influence on aerodynamic\nperformance and vehicle surface heat flux [19]. Numerical\ntechniques which fail to incorporate such behavior miss out\non an essential part of the flow physics surrounding the\nvehicle. One of the prime advantages of the DSMC method is\nthe relative ease with which it can incorporate the real-gas,\nchemically non-equilibrium behavior of the flow. In the\nDSMC methodology, particle clusters can be endowed with\nthe correct properties to capture both the kinetic and rota-\ntional modes of energy storage of the gas molecules. Taking\nthe Earth as an example, vibrational excitation of the gas\nmolecules as well as dissociation of both oxygen and nitro-\ngen are likely to be important features of the flow around any\nhypersonic vehicle at the highest altitudes (80\u2013120 km) and\nspeeds, while even at lower speeds and altitudes vibrational\nexcitation and limited dissociation of oxygen are still likely\nto be important [20]. Such real-gas effects need to be properly\naccounted for and normally the DSMC technique models\ndissociated and ionized air as a mixture of 11 species\n\u00f0N2; N2\u00fe; O2; O2\u00fe; NO; NO\u00fe; N; N\u00fe; O; O\u00fe; e?\u00de,\neach described using appropriate DSMC molecular proper-\nties. In conventional CFD, reaction rates are calculated\naccording to the Arrhenius law [20]. However, this assumes a\nlocal thermodynamic equilibrium distribution, which is\ninappropriate for rarefied hypersonic flows. In contrast, the\n\nFig. 5.15 The inverse of the density thickness of normal shock waves\nin argon gas up to Mach 11, measured experimentally and calculated\nusing the conventional Navier\u2013Stokes\u2013Fourier equations [15]\n\n5 Introduction to Atmospheric Transit 113\n\n\n\nDSMC approach is able to capture the chemical reaction rates\nthat actually apply under the non-equilibrium conditions that\nare typically encountered in high-speed rarefied gas flows. It\nshould be realized though that even the DSMC formalism is\nan approximation to the full physics of the rarefied gas\ndynamics problem, and its inherent assumptions can limit its\nutility in practice. Eventually DSMC calculations may be\nsupplanted by direct simulations, on a molecular level, of the\nflows around future atmospheric entry vehicles.\n\n5.7 Future Perspectives\n\nAlthough planetary exploration missions will continue to be\nfounded, at least for the foreseeable future, on the basis of\nexpendable, single-use technology, the Earth-return mission\nis likely to evolve in a different direction. Projected order-\nof-magnitude reductions in the cost of transferring payload\nto orbit renders reusable technology, founded on the prin-\nciples of rapid turnaround and airline-like operations, an\nextremely attractive proposition. Initial steps are been made\nin the direction of embodying these concepts into flight\narticles, for instance the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo\nsuborbital vehicle (which undoubtedly will pave the way for\nmore capable vehicles) and the Reaction Engines Skylon\nSingle-Stage-to-Orbit vehicle, which is one of several\nconfigurations that are maturing on drawing boards around\nthe world. The Space Shuttle taught that true reusability is\ndifficult to achieve in practice, largely because of the very\nhigh maintenance required by current-generation technol-\nogy, and future progress in this direction will require the\ndevelopment of low-maintenance, damage-tolerant, non-\nablative thermal protection systems, robust propulsion sys-\ntems that require minimal refurbishment between flights,\nand possibly new structural materials and fabrication con-\ncepts in order to achieve sensible payload mass fractions.\nMeanwhile, well-established and conservative design prin-\nciples will continue to be used in the near term to provide a\nworkable return capability from Earth orbit.\n\nProper design of future reentry vehicles will require the\nsimultaneous consideration of many interlinking factors:\ncalculations involving the coupled aerodynamics, structural\ndynamics and flight mechanics of any proposed vehicle will\nbe necessary to avoid some of the mistakes of the past. The\nwide disparity in timescales between the various elements\nof fundamental underpinning physics will pose a significant\nchallenge to computational techniques especially if the\noutput is to be integrated seamlessly into the design process\nor into flight simulations.\n\nA more accurate understanding of planetary atmospheres\nwill be essential in order to de-risk future missions and to\nreduce the conservatism, and hence launch mass and pro-\npulsive requirements, of future planetary probes. It should\n\nbe acknowledged however that this is somewhat of a cir-\ncular problem. Data from atmospheric probes provides only\na sample of atmospheric behavior, usually over a very short\ntimescale and at only one locality on the planet. Inference of\nthe properties of the long-term behavior of a planetary cli-\nmate, for instance on climatic timescales and synoptic or\nglobal length-scales, from this limited data is fraught with\ndifficulties. Data fusion between accurate, localized infor-\nmation from atmospheric entry vehicles with data gleaned\nat long range from planetary orbiters is only part of the\nsolution to ensuring sufficiently accurate predictions of the\nactual conditions that will be experienced by any probe as it\npenetrates the planetary atmosphere at the end of its long\ntransit from Earth. The lack of any fully validated meteo-\nrological models for the atmospheres of our planetary\nneighbors remains a distinct element of risk to the success\nof any future mission.\n\nThe ideal of an all-encompassing numerical model that\nwill allow the aerodynamics of an atmospheric entry vehicle\nto be predicted with high fidelity all the way from orbit,\nthrough the free molecular environment found at the upper\nfringes of the atmosphere, and down through the rarefied\nhigh-altitude layers to the essentially continuum-flow\nregime near the surface, stills seems a long way from\nrealization. At face value, the augmented Navier\u2013Stokes\u2013\nFourier models would appear to offer the best hope, at least\nin capturing seamlessly the transition from rarefied to\ncontinuum conditions at intermediate and lower altitudes.\nMuch effort has been devoted in the applied mathematics\ncommunity to developing such techniques, but the ultimate\ngoal is elusive. In any case, in the most highly rarefied parts\nof the atmosphere, a representation of the gas dynamics\nthrough a system of partial differential equations becomes\nentirely inappropriate, and a fundamentally different\napproach that acknowledges the particulate nature of the\nflow becomes essential. A robust thermo-chemical analysis\ntool is still lacking, and the traditional approach through\npre-determining the set of reaction pathways that are\navailable to the chemical constituents of the gas flow may\neventually be supplanted entirely by a more fundamental\napproach that is founded on elementary quantum mechanics\nbacked by relevant experimental data.\n\nIntegrating high fidelity aero-thermal calculations into\nthe design process will be aided by future advances in\ncomputer hardware, including the use of graphical proces-\nsor units (GPU) and cloud computing. The steadily reducing\ncost of high-performance computer hardware will most\nlikely lead to a move away from concentrated national\ncomputational facilities to local or distributed hardware that\nis more accessible to a broader range of academic and\nindustrial users. Indeed, the need for software that is more\nreadily accessible to a wider range of users, and that is less\ndependent on the involvement of specialist practitioners,\n\n114 R. Brown et al.\n\n\n\nwill be key to robust spacecraft design in the future, par-\nticularly as it will allow broader oversight and verification\nof the design process. The open-source approach to soft-\nware production offers a new and promising model for the\nintegration of a broad range of technical contributions into a\nunified, verified approach to spacecraft aero-thermal design.\n\nThere will always remain a need for the output of any\nsuch software to be compared and checked against the\nbehavior of the real world. As predictive methods become\nmore accurate, the age and inadequacy of the present\nexperimental database will become more and more apparent.\nIndeed, the most prolific data-gathering period was during\nthe 1960s and 1970s when data assimilation and flow visu-\nalization techniques were in their infancy. Sadly, a major\nproblem for the future validation of numerical techniques is\nposed by the increasing unaffordability, for many institu-\ntions, of high quality experimental equipment, and indeed\nthe closure of many key facilities around the world during\nrecent years. A strategic approach to the maintenance and\nexpansion of experimental facilities, most likely on a\nnational or even transnational scale, will be essential if the\ndesign of future atmospheric entry vehicles is to be properly\nsupported by the next generation of numerical tools.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Often, the payload is simply\nregarded as the package to be delivered but the nature of\nthis package, in particular its operational requirements, tend\nto drive the mission constraints as a whole\u2014launch system,\nspacecraft, telecommunications, etc. Ideally, a well-\ndesigned mission would naturally start from the mission\nrequirements whether they be scientific observations, Earth\nreconnaissance, or telecommunications, and build the sys-\ntem around those requirements. Typically, however, the\npayload design and sizing is constrained to fit a fixed\nbudget, a given launch system, and all too frequently by the\nspacecraft to which it is to be attached.\n\nThe Merriam Webster Dictionary definition of a payload\nwas introduced in Chap. 2. NASA defines a payload in a\nvery similar fashion, [1] as \u2018\u2018Any airborne or space equip-\nment or material that is not an integral part of the carrier\nvehicle (i.e. is not part of the carrier aircraft, sounding\nrocket, expendable or recoverable launch vehicle). Included\nare items such as free-flying automated spacecraft, Space\nShuttle payloads, Space Station payloads, Expendable\nLaunch Vehicle payloads, flight hardware and instruments\ndesigned to conduct experiments and payload support\nequipment.\u2019\u2019 This provides a working definition that is\nadopted in this chapter. Other chapters of this book address\nother subsystems defining the various components that lead\nto the presence of a specific piece of technology in space.\nHowever, it is difficult to fully appreciate the importance of\n\nthese subsystems on the design of a payload without making\nthe connections where relevant.\n\nThe payload must work with the spacecraft and launch\nsystems to satisfy the requirements of the mission while\ncomplying with the various constraints imposed by these\nsystems and by the overall cost and tolerance for risk. As\nsuch, there is a continuous interplay between the develop-\nment of the payload, spacecraft, and overall mission. For\nexample, the need for a payload to be in a particular orbit or\ntrajectory has a major impact on the launch vehicle selec-\ntion, the stability or pointing requirements of a payload\ninstrument drive the necessary capabilities of the spacecraft,\nthe day-to-day operation of a given payload has an impact\non the optimal orbit selection and data storage and trans-\nmission capabilities of the payload, and so forth. The\naccommodation of the payload on a given spacecraft is\ndefined by the various interfaces between the relevant\nsubsystems. It is often the case that, at least for scientific\npayloads, a number of these interfaces are given in advance\nof the payload design, thereby guiding, and sometimes\nlimiting, the capability of the payload. Optimizing the sci-\nentific or operational performance of the payload then\nrequires a number of trade-offs. All of these issues will be\ndiscussed as this narrative develops.\n\nThere are a number of texts, most notably [2] and [3],\nthat provide a step-by-step approach to designing a payload\nfrom the perspective of the detailed engineering of a space\nmission. This chapter takes a complementary approach by\nproviding a comprehensive overview of the payload design\nprocess from an operational perspective, describing the\nrange of factors that go into the definition of a payload, how\nit interacts with the various other subsystems that comprise\na space mission, and how these factors impact the payload\ndesign. Section 6.1 focuses on the basics of payload design,\nspecific issues that are common to any and all payloads\nirrespective of their purpose. Section 6.2 discusses mission\nresources and payload accommodation constraints that are\n\nD. Alexander (&)\nRice Space Institute, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA\ne-mail: dalex@rice.edu\n\nN.

Section 6.3 deals with the design drivers, i.e.\nis directly related to what the payload is supposed to do,\nwith Sect. 6.4 highlighting the constraints that impact but do\nnot drive the design. Section 6.5 looks ahead to new tech-\nnologies that will influence the kinds of payloads that will\nbe flown in the future, and Sect. 6.6 provides some con-\ncluding remarks.\n\n6.1 The Payload Design Process\n\nPayload design is simply defined as the engineering\napproach that takes the various scientific or technical\nobjectives of the mission, develops requirements for the\nmeasurements to be performed, and optimizes the perfor-\nmance of the payload within a set of specifications and\nconstraints provided by the mission. More specifically, the\ndesign of a payload must be engineered to\n1. Translate the operational requirements of the mission\n\ninto a description of the payload performance and of the\nspecific configuration needed to achieve this\nperformance.\n\n2. Develop a set of requirements on the spacecraft and\nmission as a whole that allow the payload to meet its\nrequirements.\n\n3. Assure compatibility of the various physical, functional,\nand program interfaces that couple the payload to the\nspacecraft and mission.\n\n4. Achieve high confidence in the reliability, safety, and\nsurvivability of the payload in orbit.\nSuccess in achieving these goals requires constant\n\ncommunication between the payload design and the various\nscientific, spacecraft and mission designs, and associated\nconstraints and limitations. This requires an iterative pro-\ncess of design, analysis, testing and evaluation. Early in the\ndesign phase, these communications typically involve the\nexchange of high-fidelity mathematical models of the var-\nious structural, mechanical, electrical and thermal subsys-\ntems and their related interfaces. This is particularly\nimportant when the payload is large or complex, and can,\nconsequently, have a significant impact on the spacecraft\ndesign. The application of such models early in the design is\ncritical not only for optimizing the design but also for\nproviding a benchmark against which the design can be\nverified. In addition, the mathematical models are extremely\nuseful for getting an early start on the design and verifica-\ntion of the flight software.\n\nOne way to think of the payload design process is\nthrough a modified version of the conceptual design wheel\nof Hammond [2] as shown in Fig. 6.1. In this approach, the\nrequirements bound the design process and drive the final\npayload configuration through the application of appropriate\ntechnologies with the concept being refined through an\niterative combination of analysis, design definition, and\nassessment of the design, in relation to the bounding\nrequirements. The analysis, design and assessment process\nmay lead to a re-evaluation of the requirements, in some\n\nFig. 6.1 Design circle (after\nFig. 2.1 in Ref. [2]) showing the\ninterconnection between the\ndifferent components and phases\nof the design process\n\n118 D. Alexander and N. Murphy\n\n\n\ncases, or the need for different technologies. This is more\nlikely when missions face significant constraints due to cost\nor launch energy considerations.\n\nThe technology component of Fig. 6.1 may seem initially\nto be an unnecessary complication as it could be argued that\nthis might be a waste of resources and time compared to, say,\ndesigning the payload to the requirements with a fixed\ntechnology set as a limiting factor. However, as the design\nproceeds from one or more concepts to reality, the avail-\nability of the necessary technology, its maturity, or flight\nreadiness, and the capability of the technology to meet the\nrequirements and to meet them within cost and schedule are\nall critical to generating an optimal, robust, and capable\ndesign. Assessing the available technologies allows the\npayload design to take advantage of improvements in power\nconsumption, better sensitivity, higher throughput and a\nwhole host of other factors that might provide key discrim-\ninators between the original set of design concepts. The\nconventional wisdom is that about 80 % of the total-life cost\nof a mission is determined during the concept definition\nphase. In this light, technology assessment and selection\nbecomes a major tool in driving the best design. Moreover, as\n\nthe design develops, the availability of alternative technologies\nprovides a degree of flexibility in refining the design and in\nproviding back-up possibilities in the event of increased\nperformance, cost, or scheduling risk.\n\nPayloads serve a number of purposes and can generally\nbe segregated into three broad categories: scientific\nresearch, application, and technology demonstration. In\nsome cases, payloads cover more than one of these cate-\ngories; for example a payload could be launched for\nresearch purposes but be transitioned into an operational\nmonitoring system, or perhaps a research payload compo-\nnent may also be demonstrating a new technology.\nTable 6.1 highlights these payload categories, breaking\nthem down into sample sub-categories and giving examples\nof the sorts of payload components carried and missions\nthat rely on these payloads. In addition to these broad cat-\negories of payload in terms of their desired outcome, such\nas scientific measurements or reconnaissance information,\npayloads within each category can be further classified in\nterms of the level of risk they entail relative to the impor-\ntance of the payload to the commercial customer or agency\nresponsible for its launch and operation.

The factors that NASA have identified include\ncriticality to the Agency Strategic Plan, national signifi-\ncance, availability of alternative research opportunities or\nreflight opportunities, success criteria, and magnitude of\ninvestment (Appendix A of Ref. [1]). The particular class in\nwhich the payload falls also factors into whether it is suit-\nable for launch or operation on crewed platforms such as the\nISS. Design constraints will be revisited later in Sects. 6.3\nand 6.4 but by way of introduction to payload classification,\nthe NASA payload classes are summarized in Table 6.2.\n\nThe payload is, of course, part of a larger mission and at\na systems level is regarded as simply a component of the\noverall structure that is subject to all the necessary verifi-\ncation and testing required to assure mission success.\nHowever, while mission success requires that all subsys-\ntems and their interfaces perform nominally in space, it is\nthe requirements of the payload design that most strongly\ndrive the characteristics of the other subsystems.\n\n6.1.1 Requirements Generation\n\nThe heart of good payload design, and indeed systems\nengineering in general as will be discussed in Chap. 7, is in\nunderstanding the top-level requirements and how they\ntrace directly to the specific implementation of the payload,\nand how it interfaces with the spacecraft. The design pro-\ncess must always refer back to the requirements in order to\n\nmeet the design goals within the defined budget and sche-\ndule. Mission requirements vary widely depending on the\nnature and objectives of the mission and need to take into\naccount a broad array of factors, including, for example, the\nrequired orbit, accommodation on the spacecraft, and\noperational objectives. These requirements have to be met\nwhile maintaining strict contamination control, surviving\nintegration and testing, and considering the space environ-\nment in which the payload will operate. Much of the suc-\ncess of a payload will be determined by how well and how\nearly these requirements are factored into the design.\n\nIn the previous section, three broad categories of payload\nwere defined. As a subsystem, each category has many\nrequirements in common with the others but significant\ndifferences appear when the specific nature of the payload is\ntaken into consideration. For convenience, in this chapter,\npayload types are categorized as one of three types: scien-\ntific, commercial, or military. While the goals of these\nmight be significantly different, with impact on the design\nprocess, the strict segregation is somewhat artificial since\nmany space missions, regardless of their goals, have much\nin common. However, this simple categorization allows the\nimpact of the mission goals on the design to be highlighted.\n\n6.1.1.1 Scientific Research Payloads\nThe requirements unique to scientific payloads are primarily\nfocused on meeting the observational goals of the mission\nwithin the given constraints of cost, power, mass, volume,\nreliability, operational lifetime, data collection rate, on-board\ndata storage, and telemetry rate. Thus, the various components\n\nTable 6.2 Classification considerations for NASA Class A\u2013D payloads [1]\n\nCharacterization\nfactor\n\nClass A payload Class B payload Class C payload Class D payload\n\nPriority to\nagency\n\nHigh priority,\nminimized risk\n\nHigh priority, low risk Medium priority, medium risk Low priority, high risk\n\nNational\nsignificance\n\nVery high High Medium Low to medium\n\nComplexity Very high to high High to medium Medium to low Medium to low\n\nMission lifetime Long ([5 years) Medium (2\u20135 years) Short (\\2 years) Short (\\2 years)\n\nCost High High to medium Medium to low Low\n\nLaunch\nconstraints\n\nCritical Medium Few Few to none\n\nIn-flight\nmaintenance\n\nN/A Not feasible or difficult Maybe feasible May be feasible and planned\n\nAlternative or\nre-flight\nopportunities\n\nNo alternative or\nre-flight\nopportunities\n\nFew or no alternative or\nre-flight opportunities\n\nSome or few alternative or\nre-flight opportunities\n\nSignificant alternative or re-flight\nopportunities\n\nAchievement of\nmission success\ncriteria\n\nHighest assurance\nstandards used:\nminimum risk a\nfocus\n\nStringent assurance\nonly minor\ncompromises: low risk\nmaintained\n\nMedium risk to mission success\nmay be acceptable.

Murphy\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_7\n\n\nof the observational system, e.g. telescope, camera, detec-\ntors, and data acquisition, have to be optimized in the design\nto perform to the required specifications, within the mission\nconstraints. An additional design concern for some instru-\nments is the control of electromagnetic interference (EMI) or\nmagnetic contamination from other systems or other parts of\nthe payload. Elements of the payload, such as magnetome-\nters, or plasma wave instruments, will levy requirements on\nthe system for acceptable levels of EMI and magnetic\ncleanliness and, at the system level, limits on contributions to\nthe spacecraft EMI and magnetic environment are often\nlevied on individual subsystems. An example of this might be\nlimits on the external magnetic field from a subsystem. EMI\nand magnetic contamination are also mitigated by the use of\nbooms to mount sensors. Other forms of contamination are\nalso of concern to payload elements; for example, ultraviolet\nspectrometers and imagers can be sensitive to particulate,\nmolecular, or chemical contaminations and infrared instru-\nments can be sensitive to thermal contamination (requiring\ncooling of their optical elements). As payloads become more\ncomplex, for example with multiple cameras, greater atten-\ntion must be paid to the design of the electronics, thermal\ncontrol, and data control and management. Careful optimi-\nzation of the payload configuration can reduce the number of\nelectronics boxes, radiators and CPUs with concomitant\nimpacts on the mass, power and volume budgets.\n\nIn addition, many scientific payloads have a range of\nrequired observational modes that are designed to optimize\nthe science return. These modes can impact the design of\nthe payload by increasing system complexity. For example,\naccommodating operational flexibility may require addi-\ntional mechanisms (e.g. filter wheels), smart data control\n(e.g. on-board analysis and data selection), responsive\nchanges to instrument operation (e.g. changing exposures,\nshutter controls, etc.), or ground-level command control\n(e.g. regular upload of observational command sequences).\nThese are all important factors that drive the design.\n\n6.1.1.2 Commercial Payloads\nCommercial payload requirements are more concerned with\nmeeting the goals of the customer that the payload is to\nserve and so schedule, robustness, safety, reliability, con-\ntinuity, and communications, which are important for all\npayloads, take on an increased significance for commercial\nmissions. While different commercial uses will require a\ndifferent set of design criteria, the common thread between\nthem all is to satisfy the above goals and to do so in a cost-\nefficient way and that frequently involves multiple launches\nof similar payloads. It was noted in the Commercial Space\nTransportation Study [45] performed by NASA in 1997\nthat, with respect to payloads, the design process must allow\nfor enhanced system flexibility that facilitates a payload\nchange-out up to 5 days prior to launch for the same\n\npayload and 30 days pre-launch for a different payload. The\npayload integration has to be simplified to accommodate the\nfocused (often single-purpose) operations, the standardiza-\ntion of the integration process (frequently commercial\npayloads are not unique as in the case of scientific pay-\nloads), and the more stringent schedule. These factors, when\ncoupled to the business operations of the commercial space\nservices provider, require repeatability in the payload\ndesign, a standard set of interfaces, a limited if not restricted\nset of operational modes, and compatibility with a stan-\ndardized set of launch vehicle and spacecraft conditions and\nfunctions.\n\nUntil recently, the focus of the commercial space\nindustry was the launching and operations of payloads for a\nrange of commercial uses, such as navigation, telecommu-\nnications, and entertainment. However, recent trends have\nseen an increased emphasis on space tourism and, with the\nend of the Space Shuttle program, the servicing of the\nInternational Space Station. Thus, the primary objects being\ndelivered to space would be humans or cargo, which\nprimarily have a design impact on the spacecraft and launch\nvehicle and will be addressed later chapters.\n\n6.1.1.3 Military Payloads\nCrudely speaking the requirements for military payloads are\nunique in that they place a strong focus on the same criteria\nas commercial payloads while embodying the instrument\nuniqueness of a scientific payload. The most common\nfunctions of a military payload are reconnaissance, early\nwarning capability, and space situational awareness, but the\nrange of objectives also includes navigation, secure com-\nmunications, and space-based weaponry. One unique fea-\nture of military space payloads is the relative importance of\ntechnology demonstration missions. By their nature such\npayloads tend to incur more risk than might be tolerated on\nan operational payload. Collection of engineering and per-\nformance data for subsequent analysis also impacts the\ndesign goals. Finally, an area of increased recent debate is\nthe notion of a hosted payload where a government payload,\nincluding military and intelligence missions, is \u2018hosted\u2019 on a\ncommercial launch vehicle. This necessarily impacts the\npayload design but also adds significant risk to the host\npayload and launch vehicle, most specifically matching\nrequirements and impact on schedule.\n\n6.1.2 Traceability of Operational Requirements\n\nGenerating the requirements for a given payload is the first\nand most important step in designing the payload to meet\nthe mission goals. It is also important to have direct trace-\nability of the payload design to the specific requirements\nthat factor into that design. The characterization of this\n\n6 Payload Design and Sizing 121\n\n\n\nprocess often takes the form of a requirements traceability\nmatrix that documents the flowdown from the operational\ngoals to the specific modes of operation of the payload and\nultimately to mission requirements such as choice of orbit\nand required telemetry bandwidth. Each aspect of a given\ndesign must be able to trace its origin to a requirement or set\nof requirements and this leads to traceability matrices for\neach of the mission requirements, spacecraft requirements,\npayload requirements, and operational requirements. In all\ncases, the relevant traceability matrix identifies each goal of\nthe mission, what it takes in terms of measurements to\nachieve that goal, how these measurements are attained by\nthe particular device on the payload, and how the data\ncollected is compressed, stored and downloaded. An\nexample of a generic traceability matrix for a science\npayload is shown in Table 6.3.\n\nEach science objective can be traced to a specific set of\nrequirements to attain the science and a specific set of\nobservations that will meet those requirements within the\nconstraints of the mission requirements.\n\n6.1.3 Accommodation Requirements\n\nThe payload, of course, is part of a larger system and, as a\nresult of this, the mission and spacecraft impose constraints\non the payload design. Ideally, the payload should be\ndesigned to satisfy the higher level requirements provided\nby the overall objectives of the mission. However, it is more\ncommon to optimize the design within significant con-\nstraints that cater to a specific cost cap, spacecraft bus,\nlaunch vehicle, or other resource budgets. The following\nsection discusses how the resources available to the mission\naffect the payload. Here the focus centers on the spacecraft\naccommodation of the payload and how this is optimized.\n\nKey issues in the accommodation of the payload with the\nspacecraft are the resources required by the payload, the\n\nnature and number of the interfaces and the impact these\nhave on the payload operation, and the nature and magni-\ntude of the various \u2018disturbances\u2019 to the payload that are\ngenerated by the spacecraft and its environment. Much of\nthis is discussed in other chapters but it is useful to highlight\nsome of the key issues here.\n\n6.1.4 The Spacecraft Environment\n\nA number of the aspects of the spacecraft environment need\nto be considered as part of the payload design process. The\nlaunch environment produces significant mechanical, vibra-\ntion and acoustic stresses. While this environment is transi-\ntory, it is one of the most significant drivers on the\nmechanical design of the payload. Demonstrating that a\npayload can withstand the launch environment, as transmit-\nted via the spacecraft, is a key part of the flight qualification\nprocess. The mechanical design of the payload must take into\nconsideration the spectrum and intensity of the vibration\nenvironment, including the potential for resonances. In\naddition, the low-frequency shock at liftoff, the static load\nduring launch, and the high-frequency pyrotechnic shock at\nseparation can threaten components at specific points on the\nspacecraft and in the payload. To avoid the risk of damage to\nsensitive components, a launch lock mechanism, released in\norbit, is often required. Once in orbit, the mechanical envi-\nronment is usually benign, although orbit insertion around\nanother body can also produce significant mechanical stres-\nses. While these are usually less severe than during launch,\nparticular attention must be paid to payload elements that are\ndeployed after launch, such as antennas or booms. The\nacceptable thermal environment of the payload can also be a\nsignificant driver on payload accommodation design. Pay-\nload thermal requirements are often given as allowable\noperating and non-operating (or survival) temperature limits,\nand not surprisingly, the wider the temperature range over\n\nTable 6.3 Generic scientific traceability matrix\n\nScience\nobjectives\n\nScience measurement requirements Instrument functional\nrequirements\n\nTop-level mission\nrequirements\n\nScience\nobjective 1\nScience\nobjective 2\nScience\nobjective 3\n\nData format (images spectra)\nSpatial resolution\nField-of-view\nTemporal cadence\nExposure times\nTime resolution\nRequired resolution of physical parameters of interest (temperature,\nmagnetic field, density, etc.)\n\nExposure times\nDynamic range\nWavelength selection\nWavelength range\nTime resolution\nSpatial resolution\nSpectral resolution\nImage stability\nSignal/Noise\nEffective area\n\nOrbit selection\nMission duration\nOperation mode (e.g.\ndaily uploads)\nTelemetry rate\nData collection rate\nData compression\nOn-board memory\nGround station coverage\nGround system\nmanagement\nTracking and command\ncontrol\nGround data storage\n\n122 D. Alexander and N. Murphy\n\n\n\nwhich the payload can operate and survive the simpler the\nthermal design and interfaces. Often there are particular parts\nof an instrument that need to be cooled, or have their tem-\nperatures precisely controlled, for example a CCD or a\nbolometer. In this case the payload is usually responsible for\nthe cooling or temperature control, and the thermal require-\nments on the spacecraft could include the availability of\nspace for a radiator, or a limit on the heat flow from the\nspacecraft to the payload. The use of active cooling (or\nheating) is another driver on payload design, and can be as\nsimple as a thermoelectric cooler (TEC), which will require\npower and a heat sink, or a cryocooler, although this can\nimpose vibrations on the system during operation.\n\n6.1.5 Payload Interfaces\n\nAll possible interfaces associated with a payload and pay-\nload-spacecraft pairing are defined in the Interface Control\nDocument (ICD), which will itself be discussed further in\nChap. 7. A number of interfaces can be identified, including\npayload-to-spacecraft interfaces, inter-payload interfaces\n(say between an instrument\u2019s optical path and the structural\ndesign) and space-to-ground system interfaces. In addition,\nother mission-level requirements, such as controlling and/or\nmitigating the level of contamination, may have conse-\nquences for the interface control (see Sect. 6.1.9). Many of\nthese are discussed in later chapters. In this chapter the\nfocus is on the payload-spacecraft interfaces.\n\nThe payload interfaces consist of the mechanical, ther-\nmal, and electrical connections between elements of the\npayload and the spacecraft. The mechanical interface atta-\nches instruments to the spacecraft, maintains alignment of\nthe instrument to some specified tolerance, and transmits\nlaunch loads and stresses to the instruments. It also forms\npart of the thermal interface. The thermal interface couples\nthe transfer of thermal energy to and from the payload,\neither between the payload and spacecraft, or the payload\nand the external environment, for example via radiators. As\npart of this interface, the spacecraft may provide heaters and\ntemperature monitors to maintain the payload temperatures\nwithin the allowable survival range in the event of payload\npower being removed. The electrical interface carries power\nand signals between the payload and the spacecraft system.\nRequirements that drive this interface include the required\npower for the payload, the data transfer rates, and the\nnecessary housekeeping data. Payload communication is\noften carried out over standard interfaces, such as RS422 or\nSpacewire, which have a wide range of capabilities and\nsubstantial flight heritage. Power transfer is also often\nstandardized. Many spacecraft buses provide power at a\nnominal voltage of \u00b128 V\u2014in such cases, the payload will\nprovide conditioned power at voltages required by the\n\npayload electronics, for example field programmable gate\narrays (FPGA) often need a 3.3 V supply. In some instan-\nces, the spacecraft provides conditioned power at the nec-\nessary voltages, with the required noise performance. This\ncan save mass by consolidating power supplies, but may\nalso increase system complexity and may still require power\nconditioning in the payload. It should be noted that a failure\nof the power system can essentially signify the death of a\npayload. Although consolidating power sources may pro-\nvide some efficiencies, these should not come at the expense\nof reliability. Interface definitions need to be developed\nearly in the payload design process, as they are an important\ntool in understanding the impact of the payload require-\nments on the system as a whole and the constraints placed\non the payload by the spacecraft.\n\nThe repeatability, sustainability, and affordability aspects\nof commercial and military missions, with multiple space-\ncraft being commissioned with similar operational goals,\npushes the definition of standard interfaces and integration\nprocedures. It is possible, in some cases, to modify the\ninterfaces but this typically comes with increased cost,\ncomplexity, time and risk. Most missions are constrained to\nfly on a given launch vehicle with a given spacecraft\narchitecture and as such many of the interface specifications\nare preset and allow little flexibility in the design. In some\ncases, this can limit the ability to optimize the payload to\nmeet the mission requirements, although modern interface\nprotocols have a wide range of capabilities.\n\n6.1.6 Payload Integration\n\nOn a conventional spacecraft, the integration of the payload,\nspacecraft, and launch vehicle can take anywhere from\n18 months to 3 years or more, depending upon the com-\nplexity of the payload (see Fig. 6.2). Some integration pro-\ncesses can be quite complex with the payload requiring a\nseries of additional operations, such as purging, vacuum\npumping, or instrument cooling, during the integration pro-\ncess. During the integration and subsequent testing, the\npayload is attached to the spacecraft, the functionality of the\ninterfaces is tested and compared to predictions, and then the\nperformance of the system is tested and compliance with\nrequirements is established. Final tests are carried out after\nintegration to ensure that the entire system is capable of\nachieving its required performance in the intended space\nenvironment, and that it will survive the rigors of the launch.\n\n6.1.7 Orbit Requirements\n\nFor the majority of space missions the chosen orbit is a\nfundamental component of the mission, enabling, for\n\n6 Payload Design and Sizing 123\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_7\n\n\nexample and (as discussed in Chap. 4) telecommunications\nservices from geostationary orbit, remote sensing of the\nEarth, Sun, or planet from a polar orbit, or orbit insertion\naround other bodies in support of deep space missions.\nOrbit selection feeds directly into the payload design pro-\ncess (and vice versa) in a number of ways. The orbit\ndetermines the range of environments to be encountered by\nthe payload, affects the arrangement of the ground-satellite\ncommunications (see Chap. 2), specifies the observation\nwindows whether for Earth, solar, or astronomical obser-\nvations, and determines the data handling procedures of the\npayload through the available telemetry.\n\nAs introduced in Chap. 4, orbits in common use for most\nspace missions include Low Earth Orbits (LEO), Geosta-\ntionary Earth Orbits (GEO), Sun-synchronous, polar, and a\nwide array of trajectories that are used to support missions\nthat escape Earth orbit. This last category includes planetary\nand heliocentric missions that require flybys, orbit insertion,\nand sample returns, and can involve complicated trajecto-\nries, often encompassing multiple gravity assists. Such\ntrajectories can generate severe constraints for the payload\ndesign, particularly in data handling and processing,\ntelemetry, and environment control. LEO is commonly used\nfor Earth observing, small astronomical, including solar,\nmissions and, of course, Space Shuttle flights and the\nInternational Space Station [32]. GEO is typically used for\nweather monitoring, reconnaissance and telecommunica-\ntions satellites. Sun-synchronous orbits are polar orbits with\na rate of precession proportional to their orbital period\naround the Earth, as explained in Chap. 4. This means that\nthe satellite crosses a given location on the Earth at the\nsame local time each revisit, which is useful for Earth sci-\nence observations, weather monitoring, and military\n\nreconnaissance. Polar orbits are geocentric orbits with high\ninclination angles (typically 75?\u2013105?) and are useful for a\nvariety of purposes including mapping, telecommunica-\ntions, Earth monitoring, and navigation. The final class of\norbits covers a multitude of Earth escape trajectories that\nare predominantly used for scientific missions to distant\nobjects within the solar system, including the Moon [47,\n48], Mars [49] and the other planets (e.g. [9, 19], and the\noccasional asteroid [38] or comet [14].\n\n6.1.8 Environment\n\nAs discussed in detail in Chap. 3, the operational environ-\nment has a significant impact on the operation and safety of\nthe payload and spacecraft. The interaction of the envi-\nronment with the spacecraft structure and its impact on\noperations should be carefully considered in the design\nprocess. In addition to providing some significant chal-\nlenges for contamination control (see later), the space\nenvironment can also lead to other operational difficulties,\nthese will be summarized herein. The primary concerns are\nthe effects of high-energy particle and photon radiation,\nspacecraft charging from the ambient plasma environment,\natomic oxygen interactions in LEO, and dust impacts.\n\n6.1.8.1 Radiation\nThe radiation environment is characterized primarily by the\nsource of the radiation. All orbits are subject to electro-\nmagnetic radiation from the Sun, with ultraviolet and X-ray\nradiation being the most damaging because they can induce\nphysical and chemical changes in exposed surfaces, act as\nionizing agents affecting charging of the spacecraft, and\n\nFig. 6.2 The SOHO payload [46] was a complex suite of 12\ninstruments, including remote sensing imagers, spectrometers and\nin situ particles, plasma and fields experiments. The entire spacecraft\n\nhas a mass of 1,850 kg, is three-axis-stabilized and powered by solar\npanels delivering 1,150 W. The payload itself has a mass of 650 kg\nand a power consumption of 500 W in orbit. Image ESA\n\n124 D. Alexander and N. Murphy\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_2\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_3\n\n\ncause degradation of solar arrays. Ultraviolet radiation,\nparticularly below 200 nm, is particularly damaging to solar\ncell, thermal control surfaces and optics coatings, causing\nsignificant degradation in the performance of these materi-\nals. Particle radiation derives from a number of different\nsources. For example, galactic cosmic rays, predominantly\nprotons, reach the inner solar system with very high (up to\nTeV) energies and can pass through spacecraft leaving a\nswath of ionization damage in their wake. Solar flare and\ninterplanetary-shock accelerated electrons, protons and ions\nhave lower energies than the cosmic rays but their fluences\nare much higher and so they can have more frequent effects\n[50]. Finally, locally trapped particles around planets, like\nthe van Allen radiation belts around the Earth, provide\nfrequent periods of enhanced particle radiation for an\norbiting spacecraft, e.g. passage through the South Atlantic\nAnomaly [51]. LEO spacecraft are shielded to some extent\nfrom cosmic and solar particles by the natural barrier to\ncharged particles provided by the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. All\nof these sources of radiation can lead to problems with the\nspacecraft if not carefully prepared for. Effects include\ncumulative damage related to the total dose received, of\nsingle-event effects from individual ionizing events. Many\nsources of radiation doses are also time variable and spo-\nradic, leading to widely varying conditions. Designing to\nthe worst-case scenario is often not practical due to the costs\ninvolved and consequently, there have been a number of\ninstances when large solar storms have led to the untimely\ntermination of a satellite [52] as a result of a substantial and\nrapid enhancement in the local radiation environment.\n\n6.1.8.2 Plasma\nAll spacecraft reside in an electrically neutral but highly\nionized plasma environment, either due to a planetary\nmagnetosphere or the solar wind (some spacecraft contrib-\nute to plasma environments through application of the\nmaneuvering thrusters, venting of ionized gas, etc.). The\ninteraction of the spacecraft with the rarefied plasma can\nresult in the build-up of charge on the spacecraft structure\nthat can then discharge and potentially damage electrical\ncomponents of the payload. Spacecraft in low inclination\ngeocentric orbits can spend one-third or more of their time\nwithin the shadow of the Earth. During this eclipse period,\nthe spacecraft may negatively charge to tens of kilovolts,\nwhich can lead to a severe discharge when the spacecraft\nreturns to daylight since this can result in positive charging\ncreating a large potential drop across the spacecraft. Outside\nof eclipse, spacecraft in LEO tend to become positively\ncharged because their typical velocities are greater than the\nambient ion speed but lower than the ambient electron\nspeeds. This creates a wake effect which then generates a\ndifferential charge across the structure that can generate\nstrong discharges. In GEO, in addition to any eclipse\n\nperiods, internal dielectric charging can occur from the\nincreased penetration of high-energy ambient electrons into\nthe spacecraft that negatively charge insulating materials\n(e.g. printed circuit boards) or non-grounded conductors.\nMitigating the effects of spacecraft charging can be\naccomplished by the careful selection of materials, the use\nof conductive reflective coatings for some optical compo-\nnents, particularly solar cell cover glass, to make the\nspacecraft as close to an equipotential as possible, and by\ndefining appropriate ground paths in the system [53].\n\n6.1.8.3 Atomic Oxygen\nAtomic oxygen (ATOX) is a major environmental hazard\nfor spacecraft in LEO. The flux of atomic oxygen within an\naltitude range of *180\u2013650 km above the Earth can lead to\nsevere degradation of external surfaces, particular those\nmade from polymers like Kapton?, other polyimide poly-\nmers, and Mylar?, and can, through scattering, lead to the\nerosion of internal surfaces. Measurements of the impact of\nATOX on spacecraft surfaces on board a number of Space\nShuttle Orbiter flights have shown that interactions with\natomic oxygen can produce problematic changes in the\nmass and surface properties of a range of materials, pri-\nmarily through the processes of erosion and oxidation. The\nmotion of the spacecraft through the upper tenuous reaches\nof the Earth\u2019s atmosphere can lead to the oxygen atoms\nimpacting with energies as high as 5 eV; both the velocity\nand the angle of the incident atoms are important. The\nseverity of the accumulative effect depends upon many\nparameters, including orbit altitude, level of solar activity,\nand duration of mission [54]. Potential ATOX reactions\ninclude hydrogen abstraction, formation of radicals, oxida-\ntion particularly of metals, and oxygen inclusions into the\nC\u2013H bonds of the polymers. The oxidation reactions, for\nexample, can have a marked effect on the reflective prop-\nerties of the surfaces including, most importantly, the\noptical surfaces of payload instruments. The suitability of\ncertain materials for use in the ATOX-rich environment of\nLEO depends crucially on their erosion yield, i.e. the vol-\nume of polymer lost per incident atomic oxygen atom in\ncm3/atom. Materials with high erosion yields, like most of\nthe hydrocarbon organic materials, should be avoided or\nonly used when protected by a low erosion yield material,\ne.g. fluoropolymers, or when they are not likely to come\ninto direct contact with the ATOX environment. Mitigation\nof ATOX effects can be achieved by a careful choice of\nmaterials and coatings, and by carefully designing the\npayload so that sensitive surfaces do not come into direct\ncontact with the atomic oxygen.\n\n6.1.8.4 Micrometeroids, Dust, and Space Debris\nMicrometeoroids and dust orbit the Sun and their generally\nlarge velocities provide a direct hazard to the structure of\n\n6 Payload Design and Sizing 125\n\n\n\nany space mission. These particles are much larger than\nindividual atoms but small enough to be unobservable. Most\nmicrometeoroids come from the plumes ablated from\ncomets in the inner solar system, although a small fraction\ncome from asteroids. Interplanetary dust, as its name\nimplies, is scattered throughout the solar system, between\nthe planets, and is mostly a hazard for planetary missions.\nSpace debris is the collection of objects that remain from\nnow-defunct missions, ejecta from control thrusters and\nrocket plumes, and particles of spacecraft material knocked\noff orbiting spacecraft via collisions with other objects.\nSpace debris objects can be as large as a dead or dormant\nspacecraft, and it is estimated that several thousands of\nobjects great than 10 cm across are tracked as orbiting\ndebris.1 Trackable objects can, in principle, be avoided by\nspacecraft maneuvering and objects smaller than about\n1 mm across do not generally penetrate a spacecraft. This\nleaves the range 1 mm\u201310 cm as the critical size of particle\nin terms of spacecraft damage. In addition, a typical impact\nvelocity in LEO is about 10 km/s for orbiting debris and\nabout 20 km/s for micrometeoroids, fast enough for even a\nsmall particle to create significant damage. Near the Earth,\nthe space debris environment presents the most significant\nhazard but in higher orbits, or for missions in hyperbolic\norbits, the dust and micrometeoroid impacts provide the\ngreatest danger. The small sizes and lack of knowledge of\nthe size and velocity distributions of these particles require\nthat calculations of the expected fluxes that can be\nencountered for a given orbit must be dealt with statisti-\ncally. Protecting the payload from the collisions with\nmicrometeoroid, dust, or space debris particles in the\n0.1\u201310 cm size range presents a considerable challenge in\nthe payload design. In a high flux environment the space-\ncraft and payload structure can suffer enhanced erosion,\ndegradation of surfaces, and potential catastrophic loss of\noperational systems. Mitigation of these effects involves\nprotecting the sensitive surfaces and components behind\nthicker structure or via multi-layer shielding, e.g. foils,\nwhich effectively shatter the incoming particles into a\nharmless spray on the inner walls of the shielding. This\napproach tends to be successful for particles up to about\n1 cm [3]. More shielding would be required to protect the\npayload from the larger particles but often this is not a\nviable or attractive design option. In such cases, avoiding\nthe main orbital traffic lanes or pointing sensitive surfaces\naway from the direction of travel are trades that should be\nconsidered as the design progresses.\n\n6.1.9 Contamination Control\n\nContamination control is crucial to the success of a given\nmission. This applies to on-ground manufacturing, inte-\ngration, and testing as well as on-orbit instrument opera-\ntions. Contamination can have several deleterious effects\nincluding degradation of optical and thermal control sur-\nfaces, degradation of the power system, electrical noise, and\nshort-circuiting of electronics, and can lead to poorer pre-\ncision on a variety of sensitive mechanisms. Very early in\nthe design process, a contamination control plan should be\ndeveloped and the design process should make every effort\nto minimize contamination at each stage. It is significantly\ncheaper to follow precise contamination control procedures\non the ground than to correct for poor contamination control\nwhile in space.\n\nThe nature of the contamination depends crucially on the\nenvironment present at the various stages of the creation of\nthe mission: laboratory/clean room, testing, launch, and\nspace environments. On the ground, the largest sources of\ncontamination are the people working on the payload.\nHuman-borne contaminants can be introduced to the pay-\nload from clothing, breathing, sneezing, hair, skin, etc.\nAdditional sources include the fallout from any nearby\nmachining, particulate matter in the testing environments,\nand outgassing from the structural materials used. A number\nof contamination control documents exist at the various\nspace agencies, both for airborne and surface particulates,\norganic and non-organic molecules, to define the require-\nments that must be met (e.g. [55\u201358]). These define the\nmaximum acceptable levels of contaminant (particles per\ncubic meter of air), generally as a function of particle size.\nIn space the primary contaminants depend mainly on the\norbit selected. LEO missions suffer particularly from atomic\noxygen, which can lead to strong oxidation of metal sur-\nfaces, react with the surfaces to produce volatiles, and\nchemically react with the surfaces to produce radiation, for\nexample atmospheric glow as discussed in Chap. 3 [59].\nOther sources include micrometeoroids, space debris, and\nthruster plumes and outgassing from the spacecraft.\n\nThe effects of contamination can be kept within\nacceptable levels with the proper application of contami-\nnation control processes. Isolating sensitive surfaces from\nsources of contamination, using low outgassing materials\nand the vacuum-baking of components, and nitrogen-purg-\ning the instrument during assembly and ground operations\ncan all serve to attain the required performance from the\npayload. Locating cables and connectors on the outside of\nthe payload structure can facilitate contamination control\nduring integration with the spacecraft. Use of witness\nsamples in place of actual components can provide a direct\nmeans of understanding the level of contaminants. Other\npro-active measures can be taken to protect sensitive\n\n1 At the present time the orbital information for objects greater than\n10 cm is publicly available. However, it is widely known that smaller\nobjects are also being monitored but this information is classified and\nnot in the public domain at the time of writing.\n\n126 D. Alexander and N. Murphy\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_3\n\n\ninstruments during the outgassing phase when in space. For\nexample, installing CCD decontamination heaters that\nactivate shortly after launch can protect the CCD from thin\nlayers of molecular contaminants, although larger-scale\ncontamination can form small, localized structures that\nsurvive the bakeout process.\n\n6.1.10 Verification\n\nAs the design and construction of the payload progresses,\nverifying that it meets its requirements is critical to pro-\nducing a successful payload. The definition of the verifi-\ncation plan, with a carefully defined set of verification\ncriteria for each payload element and a verification method\n(analysis, inspection, demonstration), should occur early in\nthe design process. The actual verification process takes\nplace later in the development of the payload. Verification\ncan be costly, especially when requiring demonstration or\ntesting, so the criteria to be verified must match well to the\nrequirements and be precisely defined. It is very difficult to\nverify vaguely specified requirements, such as the detector\nwill have a good signal-to-noise ratio. This frequently\nnecessitates a translation of a given requirement into a\nverifiable statement: \u2018\u2018the detector shall have a signal-to-\nnoise ratio of at least 100:1 at a wavelength of 656 nm\u2019\u2019.\nThe verification plan will specify the components to be\nverified, the level of verification, whether it be at the\ncomponent or systems level, the verification method to be\nused, e.g. demonstration, and the schedule for the\nverification.\n\nThe types of verification method used are: test, where a\ncomponent of the payload is operated under specified con-\nditions and compared with the requirement; analysis, where\nmodels or simulations of the component or system of\ncomponents are used; demonstration, where the functional\nbehavior of an operating component is shown to follow\nexpectations; and inspection, where the designs and asso-\nciated documentation are reviewed periodically to deter-\nmine whether the requirements are being met. This is\ndiscussed further in Chap. 7.\n\n6.1.11 Trade Studies\n\nTrade studies are an important component in the design of a\npayload. As the design matures from a set of concepts\nthrough downselect and final design, a number of critical\ndecisions need to be made that not only respond to the\nchoices available, the trades, but also to changing condi-\ntions, the trade-offs. It is important to make the key trades as\nearly as possible in the design process because this leads to\nthe biggest cost savings and the lowest risk. Some trades\n\nand trade-offs are payload specific but trades at the mission\nlevel can have a severe impact on the payload design.\nTypical trades that impact the payload design include\n\u2022 Orbit selection\u2014Launch costs are significantly lower for\n\nLEO and the ground-to-space communications are less\ncomplex compared to other orbits, e.g. GEO or Sun-\nsynchronous. However, for most commercial and military\npayloads the choice of orbit is fixed by the operational\npurpose of the mission. For scientific payloads, there may\nbe some merit to an orbit trade-off even at the expense of\nsome of the science return. For example, a high data\nrequirement might benefit from the increased telemetry\nand ground-support from LEO but at the expense of\ncontinuous coverage of a given location on the Earth or of\na specific astronomical object.\n\n\u2022 Spacecraft autonomy\u2014Autonomous operations can sig-\nnificantly reduce operations costs and complexity as well\nas optimize data collection and/or transmission. How-\never, developing the \u2018smart\u2019 software for autonomous\noperations is expensive and a high level of autonomy\nreduces the flexibility of the operations and potentially\nincreases risk.\n\n\u2022 Mission-specific flight software\u2014Developing new flight\nsoftware is unavoidable for many one-of-a-kind payloads,\nand also for some repeat payloads. However, reusing\nsoftware from previous missions when possible can\nprovide a major cost savings and also provide a measure\nof reliability and lower risk. This comes again at the\nexpense of flexibility.\n\n\u2022 Data management\u2014On-board data storage and process-\ning can make for more efficient use of available telemetry\ncompared to real-time data transmission, which provides\ninformation as needed but is operationally more complex.\nIn many cases, especially those that collect large amounts\nof high-bit data (e.g. high resolution images), the avail-\nable telemetry is the driving constraint that makes the\nchoice of on-board data management significantly more\nattractive.\n\n\u2022 Technology trades\u2014A key consideration in the design\nprocess is the selection of the right technology for the\nobjectives of the mission. The trade-offs here are typi-\ncally in the category of performance versus cost, although\nfor more advanced technologies at lower technology\nreadiness level (TRL; see Sect. 2.3.3 for a definition of\nthe various levels) it may be more of a performance\nversus schedule issue. In addition, when comparing\ntechnologies the risk issues should also be borne in mind,\nparticularly when pushing to those that have not been\nflight-tested. The range of applications where technology\ntrades may be important can be quite large, including\nbetter thermal, electrical or mechanical control, better\nenvironmental control and mitigation, higher perfor-\nmance detectors, better structural rigidity, higher\n\n6 Payload Design and Sizing 127\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_7\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_2\n\n\naccuracy guidance and control, use of previous flight\nspares, and so on.\n\n\u2022 Operational trades\u2014The primary goal of the payload is\nto produce the highest level of performance given the\nimposed constraints. Often, there is a degree of flexibility\nin the choice of the operational modes of the payload,\nwhere a bit of give and take can significantly improve the\noperational return. For example, spatial accuracy can be\ntraded against temporal accuracy, or wavelength cover-\nage for higher cadence, etc. These trade-offs are severely\nlimited by the mission requirements and can lead to\nchanges in other parts of the system that may be far from\noptimal, e.g. increased power requirement or higher\ntelemetry. It is important to adhere as closely as possible\nto the operational requirements of the mission but to be\nopen to some flexibility in the payload operation.\n\n\u2022 Risk versus return trades\u2014One of the most hotly debated\nareas when discussing trade studies for a mission is how\nmuch risk is worth how much gain. As the space industry\nhas matured the assumption of risk has become anathema\nto most missions. Risk aversion is often the order of the\nday, and more often than not, the risk versus return trade\ndiscussions come down on the side of caution. However,\nthe acceptance of a small or moderate increase in the risk\nto the mission may lead to significant enhancements to\nthe operational or scientific return and it is often useful to\nconsider all options during the early phases of the design.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing again, that the earlier in the design\nprocess that the above trades are made, the less likely it is to\nrun into scheduling and cost overruns and the more likely it\nis to have as near an optimum design as possible.\n\n6.1.12 Conclusions\n\nIn summary, the basic design process involves a step-by-\nstep approach through a number of well-defined tasks with\nsome tasks being revisited as the design matures. The pro-\ncess starts with the generation of the project objectives and\nrequirements, the identification of the various payload and\nspacecraft subsystems needed to meet these requirements,\nthe development of implementation plans, and the analysis\nof any trade off. This leads to a conceptual design (see\nFig. 6.1) that provides the basis for the detailed design of\nthe payload. From the conceptual design and the trade-offs,\nanalysis refinements to the program and mission require-\nments can be made and the payload specifications defined,\nin concert with an assessment of the costs and schedule. The\ndetailed design then proceeds through the development of\nthe selected concept and specific hardware/software speci-\nfications, the procurement of the necessary components and\nparts, and the manufacturing and assembly of the final\npayload. It is very important early in the detailed design\n\nprocess to put together plans for verification and testing\nwith a prescribed schedule and to perform these tasks at the\nappropriate points in the development. The final task, prior\nto launch and operation, is to verify, via testing or analysis,\nthat all of the requirements are being met by the final\npayload. In particular, a sensitivity to the environment in\nwhich the payload will operate for the bulk of its functional\nlife is crucial. The radiation, both particle and electromag-\nnetic, dust and magnetic conditions that surround a space-\ncraft tend to vary with location in the orbit, with time as\nsolar conditions change, and with distance from the Earth:\ntypically a payload will have to operate safely in all of these\nenvironments. The verification process must be performed\nin conditions that are as close to nominal as possible, while\nmeasures should be implemented to mitigate the expected\nworst-case scenarios, e.g. passage through the South\nAtlantic Anomaly [51].\n\n6.2 Mission Resources\n\nAfter the initial experiment design process has developed a\nset of science requirements and corresponding set of mea-\nsurement requirements, it is important to determine what is\nrequired from the spacecraft system in order to support the\nproposed payload. These factor into the development of the\noverall mission requirements, or as part of an iterative pro-\ncess to optimize the overall design as discussed in the pre-\nvious section. The resources needed to accommodate the\npayload can be categorized as those resources needed\ndirectly by the payload, mass and power for example, and the\nadditional resources required in other spacecraft systems to\nsupport the payload, e.g. additional structural mass, space-\ncraft pointing precision or telecom antenna size, or pro-\ngrammatic resource constraints, such as redundancy, risk,\ntechnology readiness or margin. The resources required by\nthe payload are ultimately captured in the interface specifi-\ncations that describe all the aspects of the connection\nbetween the payload and spacecraft, including mechanical\nand thermal interfaces, power requirements with associated\nvoltages, and telemetry and commanding interfaces. Often\nthere will be requirements on electromagnetic cleanliness\nand acceptable interference levels levied by the payload on\nthe system as a whole (including components of the payload\non each other) and levied by the system on the payload (see\ncontamination discussion in Sect. 6.1). Again, these are\ncaptured in the interface documents.\n\nThe most obvious payload needs are mass, power and\ntelemetry bandwidth and are usually quite straightforward\nto determine, although there are subtleties such as cable\nharness mass, detailed estimates of which require knowl-\nedge of the spacecraft bus configuration. If mass is a major\ndriver (which is often the case) a number of design choices\n\n128 D. Alexander and N. Murphy\n\n\n\ncan be made to reduce the overall payload mass. If the\npayload consists of multiple instruments, then it may be\npossible to share resources between instruments. A common\ndata processing unit or housing electronics cards from\nseveral instruments in one chassis can significantly reduce\nmass in some cases. These approaches may have impacts in\nsystems engineering and integration and testing, but don\u2019t\nusually drive costs. More aggressive approaches include the\nuse of magnesium alloys instead of aluminum for instru-\nment structures, or using composites for optical benches\n(this is sometimes done to improve rigidity and reduce\nthermal expansion in optical systems). These lower mass\nstructural elements can significantly reduce the mass con-\nstraints while also improving performance but are expen-\nsive and, in some cases, may require custom builds, all of\nwhich increase cost and may impact the schedule.\n\nTelemetry bandwidth can be a key driver of mission\ncomplexity. Both the bandwidth needed to return the payload\ndata to the ground and the bandwidth needed to move the data\nthrough the spacecraft bus are important, and can be signif-\nicantly different, depending upon on-board processing and\ndata compression. For high bandwidth missions, telemetry\nbandwidth can form part of a complex trade between the\ntelecom system (antenna size, antenna pointing control, RF\npower), on-board computing capability, on-board data stor-\nage, payload mass, and power. A significant driver is often\nthe quality, continuity and timeliness of the returned data:\nwhat data loss is allowable during transmission, what\nobserving duty cycle is required, and how quickly does the\ndata need to be returned to Earth? If data can be stored for\nlong periods on the spacecraft before being returned to\nground, then the telecom system and operations concept can\noften be simplified: if data is required soon after collection\nthis can be a significant driver on the complexity and cost of a\nmission. Data management for the payload includes the\nselection of telemetry bandwidth, the use of ground-based\nantennas for data collection and the on-board storage and\ncompression of data, and involves trades in all these areas\n(see the following section and Chap. 2).\n\nInstruments often require control and knowledge of their\norientation in terms of the direction they need to view, the\nrequired level of control and knowledge of that direction,\nand the required field of view. Concerns that need to be\nidentified in concert with determining pointing require-\nments are the potential for mutual interference, for example\nby obscuration of fields of view in optical systems, or side-\nlobe interference in RF systems, and required observation\nstrategies. The latter can again lead to a complex set of\ntrades: if a telescope system needs to collect data for a few\nhours a day, then the spacecraft can be reoriented to allow\nhigh bandwidth data return, if continuous data collection is\nrequired, then the telecom system must be more complex,\nusing, for example, a gimbaled antenna.\n\nIt is rare that a payload system does not require some\ncontrol of its operating temperature. This could be to keep\nelectronics within tens of degrees of room temperature, to\ncontrol an optical bench to within 0.1 ?C, or to maintain a\nfocal plane at a temperature of -50 ?C. In each case\nhowever, interactions with the spacecraft play a significant\nrole in determining how difficult the requirements are to\nachieve. Thermal control becomes particularly important\nwhen part of an instrument requires significant cooling. This\noccurs most often with imaging systems, when visible focal\nplanes need to be cooled to reduce dark current, or infrared\nfocal planes and optical systems need cooling to prevent\nthermal noise swamping the desired system. Passive cooling\ncan sometimes be used for cooling visible light CCDs, with\na radiator on the outside of the spacecraft coupled to the\nCCD via a conducting strap. This is the simplest approach,\nbut does impose an additional constraint on the spacecraft\norientation, to avoid solar illumination of the radiator.\nMaintaining temperatures below about 100 K requires an\nactive cooling system: this could be as simple as a ther-\nmoelectric (Peltier) cooler [60], or for even lower temper-\natures a cryostat (essentially a large thermos flask) or an\nactive cryocooler. Missions have been launched that used\ncryostats cooled with solid hydrogen, e.g. the Wide-field\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE) [61], or liquid helium in\nthe case of the Spitzer mission [62]. While cryostats can be\nsimpler to implement than active cryocoolers, they do\nimpose a finite lifetime on the observing system (see dis-\ncussion in advanced technology cryocoolers in Sect. 6.5).\n\nThe control and commanding of payload elements can\nalso drive the need for resources, both on the spacecraft and\non the ground. Control can be required for simple opera-\ntions such as changing an instrument mode, with no inter-\naction with the rest of the payload, or for complex activities\nsuch as reorienting the spacecraft to capture images.\nCommanding a payload to carry out these operations can be\ndone via a stored sequence of commands on the spacecraft,\nwhich can be periodically uplinked, or in \u2018real-time\u2019 by\nsending commands from the ground when needed. Both\napproaches have their advantages\u2014for example, the latter\ngives more flexibility to respond to events, while the former\nis less impacted by the availability of a telemetry link. The\ncomputing power needed to operate an instrument, or entire\npayload, both in processing and executing commands and\ncontrolling the basic operation of the instrument can be a\nsignificant driver on resource requirements\u2014simple\ninstruments can be controlled as state machines, with\nfirmware executed by field programmable gate arrays\n(FPGA), while more complex operations may require\npowerful CPUs with complex flight software. A complex\nhardware and/or software design can significantly increase\nthe overall cost of the payload, particularly given the need\nfor more sophisticated test and verification efforts.\n\n6 Payload Design and Sizing 129\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_2\n\n\nHowever, such costs may be justifiable if they result in a\nsignificant savings in the operation costs. An aspect of\npayload control that is receiving increasing interest is the\nuse of on-board autonomy to control aspects of payload\noperation or data manipulation. A good example of this type\nof capability is sometimes seen in payloads that study space\nplasmas in situ. NASA\u2019s Time History of Events and\nMacroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) mis-\nsion [9] used a \u2018burst mode\u2019 capability to change the\noperating mode of multiple instruments in response to\ntriggers derived from data collected by each spacecraft\n(THEMIS had five separate spacecraft). This allowed the\nspacecraft to capture high rate data around interesting\nevents in the magnetosphere, without overburdening the\ntelemetry link. This type of autonomy is key to capturing\nsporadic events that cannot be predicted and are too brief to\nbe captured by a response from Earth.\n\nFinally, programmatic drivers on a mission can have a\nsignificant effect on the resources required by the payload.\nIn particular, the need for redundancy can drive mass and\ncomplexity as can the imposition of large margins. The\nlatter can be mitigated somewhat by using high-heritage\ninstruments, where the potential for growth is more pre-\ndictable, but often payloads require capabilities that go\nbeyond the current state of the art (larger format CCDs, for\nexample). Balancing the desire for enhanced performance\nagainst the cost and complexity of a payload is a key part of\nthe payload design process.\n\nThe interplay between the mission resources and the\nultimate capability of the payload is important in the design\nof a successful mission. Limited resources can severely\n\nimpact the performance of the payload while a poorly\ndesigned payload operations plan can severely tax the\navailable resources. While there may be some flexibility in\nthe mission to accommodate additional resources, this is\nrare and, in any event, optimal performance is best achieved\nwhen the resources and payload capability are closely\nmatched early in the design.\n\n6.3 Design Drivers\n\nThe opening sections of this chapter addressed the basics of\npayload design featuring an overview discussion of the\nvarious high-level factors that impact the design of a space\npayload, whether it be for scientific, commercial, or other\npurposes. In this section the emphasis is on the particular\nfactors that drive the design. In other words, while\naddressing all of the factors discussed previously is neces-\nsary in order to generate an optimized design for the task at\nhand within the various budget and scheduling constraints,\nthere are specific factors that have little or no flexibility if\nthe overall mission goals are to be achieved. These pri-\nmarily come down to how the various top-level require-\nments are defined (see Fig. 6.3).\n\n6.3.1 Performance Requirements\n\nThe most important attribute of a space payload is its per-\nformance: will it meet or exceed the required level of\noperation throughout the lifetime of the mission? Designing\n\nFig. 6.3 Payload design drivers\nand interconnections\n\n130 D. Alexander and N. Murphy\n\n\n\nand sizing the payload to satisfy the performance require-\nments necessitates a clear specification of the objectives of\nthe mission, the flowdown into the payload characteristics,\nand the implementation of these characteristics into the final\ndesign of the payload. This flowdown is described in terms\nof different levels of requirements. For the payload, level 1\nrequirements capture the high-level objectives of the pay-\nload, and level 2 requirements capture the required instru-\nment. The transition from a conceptual design to the\ndetailed design was discussed earlier, following the con-\nsiderations of cost, schedule, the various trade-offs, and\nintegration. Here the focus is on the specifics of the payload\noperational design.\n\nThe first stage of any mission is to specify as completely as\npossible the operational goals of the payload. This is often\narticulated as a set of requirements that flow down from the\nhighest level mission requirements first to a set of measure-\nment or performance requirements and then down to a set of\ninstrument functional requirements. For scientific missions\nthis leads to a set of scientific instruments designed to answer\na specific top-level set of science questions. An overall\nstrawman payload design may be produced by a science\ndefinition team prior to a competitive selection process and is\nthen made more rigorous during the conceptual design stage\n(or Phase A). Commercial and military payloads have a very\ndifferent flight rationale, and as such the goals of the mission\ntend to be more focused on the direct operation than the broad\ntop-level goals of a science mission. However, the payload\ndesign must respond to these high-level requirements, and\nthe expected payload performance must be traceable back to\nthese requirements. The commercial payload, then, is\ndesigned to meet a specific operational goal, e.g. to provide\ncontinuous telecommunication connections within a specific\ngeographic region, with a certain precision, accuracy, and\nsustainability under a very well defined set of constraints,\nsuch as minimum signal strength and data rate over a given\nbandwidth for a minimum number of simultaneous users.\nSimilarly, military payloads typically focus on safety, reli-\nability, ease of operation, production and testing, and, of\ncourse, affordability. As such, military, and for that matter\nmost commercial, payloads pay more consideration to\nredundancy and have longer design lives than most scientific\nmissions. Moreover, military and surveillance payloads fre-\nquently have to be responsive to events that happen on\ntimescales shorter than a typical design-to-build duration,\nand therefore having a standardized system with some built-\nin flexibility, i.e. a spacecraft that can accommodate a range\nof payload sizes, is desirable but has a significant impact on\nthe design of such payloads.\n\nMost missions are based on a response to an\nAnnouncement of Opportunity (AO) or Request for Pro-\nposals (RFP) and so can be constrained in advance by the\n\navailable funding, limited range of spacecraft and launch\nvehicle options, and, often, on a preset scientific focus\ndefined in advance by a specially commissioned study\npanel, specific program goals, direct commercial or military\nneed, roadmap exercise, or international agreement.\n\nWhatever defines the constraints, the primary purpose of\nthe early design stage of the payload is to define the specific\ninstrument performance requirements needed to meet the\nstated goals and identify what requirements the payload\nplaces on the spacecraft and mission as a whole (power and\ntelemetry requirements, for example). This will typically\nrequire a number of compromises (trade-offs) and refine-\nments to be made as the operational goals are translated into\na working design, and often trade studies that compare\ndifferent measurement approaches or mission architectures.\nThis is where there is a significant difference between sci-\nentific missions and most commercial or military missions.\nFrequently, the predefined goals of a scientific mission are\nbroad and attack a particular scientific phenomenon and\nclass of observation giving significant leeway in nature and\nperformance of the various conceptual payloads proposed to\nmeet these goals. Entire payloads, or individual instruments\nare usually selected competitively via a proposal process,\nwith the science and science implementation reviewing the\nresulting proposals and selecting the best conceptual design\nthat meets the performance requirements and seems likely\nto achieve the operational goals within the stated con-\nstraints. This conceptual design forms the basis of what will\ndevelop into the Baseline Mission, while a subset of this\ndesign, one that meets the minimum performance required\nto meet the operational goals, is generally referred to as the\nMinimum or Threshold Mission. The Baseline Mission is\ndesigned to accomplish the entire set of identified mission\nobjectives while the Threshold Mission provides a measure\nof the minimum expected performance of the payload and is\nthe worst-case fallback position should the development of\nthe baseline payload fail to meet the performance, schedule,\nor cost targets. Any performance below the Threshold\nMission level is deemed not to be justifiable at the proposed\ncost. The Minimum Mission should be sufficiently different\nfrom the Baseline Mission in terms of its key capabilities and\nability to meet the mission objectives. Simple de-scoping of\nthe instruments that don\u2019t result in cost or schedule savings,\nor shortening of the operational duration of the mission to\nmake up for cost or schedule overruns are generally not\nconsidered to differentiate the two concepts. Should the\ndevelopment of the payload run into problems, a prioritized\nplan to reduce the capability, with respect to the performance\nrequirements, is required during the concept study (Phase A)\nperiod. This plan should consider key risk drivers, approa-\nches for their mitigation and the full range of possible\nde-scoping options, with triggers for each such option.\n\n6 Payload Design and Sizing 131\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Measurement Requirements\n\nThe ability of the payload to perform to specifications and to\nmeet the overall mission requirements depends crucially on\nthe ability of the payload instrumentation to make the req-\nuisite set of measurements with sufficient precision. The\nmeasurement requirements are the major drivers on the\ndesign of the payload because the operability of the instru-\nments requires a range of resources and accommodations.\nThis is particularly true for complex payloads with multiple\ninstruments. Moreover, the ability of the instruments to meet\nthe measurement requirements has to be verified during the\npayload development and they must be calibrated both dur-\ning the design and in space. This flow of requirements is\ncaptured in the traceability matrix, which relates a specific\nmeasurement objective downwards to a specific function of a\ngiven instrument and upwards to the relevant mission\nobjective. The payload design has to accommodate the\noperation and calibration of the instruments and the valida-\ntion of the measurements they make.\n\nThe primary issue that drives the design is therefore the\nrequirement that the instrument(s) meet or exceed in the\ndynamic range, accuracy, sensitivity (signal-to-noise), res-\nolution (spatial, spectral/energy, temporal), and throughput\nthresholds defined by the overall mission objectives. Fur-\nthermore, the data management, payload operability, mea-\nsurement calibration, and cadence of measurements all\nfactor into the design, the interface with the spacecraft, and\nspacecraft operations.\n\nAs discussed in the performance requirements section\nabove, scientific, commercial, and military payloads often\nemphasize different driving factors to optimize in the spe-\ncific set of measurements or observations required. All of\nthe above parameters influence, and are influenced by,\nspacecraft operations (e.g. 3-axis stabilized or not) and\nmission specifications (e.g. choice of orbit), further\nemphasizing how an optimal design is one where all of the\nsystem elements are considered together.\n\nIt is not always guaranteed that all of the measurement\nrequirements can be met in a single operational mode of an\ninstrument. The signal-to-noise ratio of a given measure-\nment is critical regardless of the required performance.\nDepending on the operational goals of the mission, this\nrequirement can be very strict or relatively lax but to make\nmeaningful use of the data collected the signal always has to\nbe distinguished from the noise. In an operational envi-\nronment where photons (or particles) are limited, e.g.\nastrophysical observations or low-contrast reconnaissance\nobservations, there is a direct competition between the\nvarious temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions and the\nrequired sensitivity. Consequently, the throughput becomes\na controlling factor. The design challenge is to maximize\nthe throughput subject to the various constraints on the\n\nmission. In addition to the usual constraints of cost, sche-\ndule, mass, power, volume, etc., constraints which directly\naffect the measurements and that, in most cases, tend to\nlower the throughput must also be included. Such con-\nstraints include the trades between field-of-view and spatial\nresolution, aperture size and scattered light management,\nwavelength coverage and signal discrimination. There are a\nnumber of ways to meet these challenges and these should\nbe reflected in the range of conceptual designs that essen-\ntially initiate the payload design process (see Fig. 6.1). For\ninstance, a simple solution to many problems would be to\nbuild a bigger, more complex, and more capable payload,\nassuming there are no restrictions imposed on cost, sche-\ndule, launch vehicle, etc. However, this is typically not a\nviable option. More feasible approaches include\n\u2022 Carefully planned selection of operation modes where\n\nphotons are shared differentially between the various\nobservational modes (e.g. spectral resolution at the\nexpense of spatial resolution, signal to noise at the\nexpense of temporal resolution).\n\n\u2022 Autonomous capability to respond to changing conditions\nin the quantities being measured (e.g. changing exposure\ntime, localizing or widening field of view, changing\nmagnification, collecting bursts of higher cadence data).\n\n\u2022 Simplifying the payload to focus on providing a set of\nroutine measurements where the design compromises,\nbetween the different instruments or instrument modes,\nand meets the operational goals but does not push the\nlimits (e.g. fixed sequence of observations with each\nobservation having a fixed set of parameters).\nA more complex operational approach often produces a\n\nmore costly and risky design, along with more expensive\nday-to-day operations. Simple, routine, synoptic observa-\ntions often involve the least risk but at the expense of tai-\nlored operation and flexibility. The key factor is to weigh\nthe scientific or operational return against the increased\ncomplexity and risk.\n\nThe ability to satisfy the measurement requirements is\nnot reliant on the instrument operations alone. Restrictions\nimposed by the data management system must also be\nconsidered. Data management includes the capability of the\npayload or spacecraft to collect, store, and transmit data,\nand this is intimately tied to the measurement requirements\non the one hand, and the ability to transmit the data to the\nground on the other. The expected data volume to be han-\ndled, how this data is managed on board, and how it is\ntransmitted to the ground, all factor into the allowable\nthroughput. If real-time data is required then the spacecraft\nmust be in contact with a ground station and the data vol-\nume is limited by the telemetry rate, which is, in turn,\ndetermined by the communications system, the orbit, and\nthe data compression approach used. If downlink time is\nlimited, say to several 10 min passes per day, then only a\n\n132 D. Alexander and N. Murphy\n\n\n\nlimited amount of real-time measurements can be made and\noperators must then rely more heavily upon on-board data\nstorage and subsequent transmission. On-board data storage\ndoes not, unfortunately, remove the telemetry limits, but it\ndoes allow the operators to utilize on-board processing to\npre-select what data gets downloaded: data above a certain\ncount rate threshold; data that meets some predetermined\nbehavioral or fidelity criteria, for example. On-board stor-\nage can also provide operational simplifications by decou-\npling payload observations from data downlink by using\nonly a high-power transmitter intermittently, or pointing a\nhigh-gain antenna at the ground station when high-rate data\nare being returned. In designing the payload, consideration\nmust be given to the data handling, in particular how much\nand what kind of data is to be stored for subsequent\ndownlinking, as this will feed directly into the operation of\nthe payload and will affect the instruments\u2019 ability to meet\nthe measurement requirements.\n\nIn order to verify and validate whether the payload is\nmeeting the measurement requirements while in space, it is\nimportant to take and transmit instrument, payload, and\nspacecraft health and safety data (e.g. operational temper-\natures, battery charge, communications status). In addition,\ndifferent mission types place different levels of importance\non the fidelity of the data and are more or less tolerant of\ndata transmission errors. Commercial payloads place a lot\nof emphasis on maximizing the data rate and minimizing\ndata errors. The requirement of a high data rate impacts the\non-board communications system by requiring either large\nantennas and/or higher transmitter power. The design trade\nhere depends on whether the spacecraft can accommodate\nthe necessary increase in power and/or antenna size.\nAccommodating a high data rate is also important for high-\nthroughput scientific payloads, especially those without a\ncontinuous dedicated downlink (i.e. a less than 100 % duty\ncycle). The bit error rate denotes the probability of a bit\nerror occurring in the data transmission either within the\nspacecraft or between the spacecraft and the ground. The\nhigher the bit error rate the more likely it is that data will be\nirrecoverably lost, although error correcting codes in\npacketized telemetry will recover some lost bits. In addi-\ntion, there are a number of encoding schemes that are\ndesigned to enhance error resistance, e.g. low-density-par-\nity-check (LDPC) codes [63]. For most scientific payloads\nthe occasional loss of data is frustrating but manageable.\nThis may not be true for commercial or military payloads\nwhere such a loss could lead to significant financial impact\nor critical loss of information.\n\nOne last data management issue of great relevance to\nmeeting the measurement requirements is the use of data\ncompression and whether to allow for lossy or lossless\ncompression. Data compression significantly increases the\namount of data that can be stored and transmitted, and by\n\nthat token is a good thing. Lossless data can exceed factors\nof 3:1 or 4:1 (with some wavelet-based algorithms claiming\nmuch higher lossless compression [64] and so potentially a\ngreat boon to data intensive payloads). In some cases lossy\ncompression may be tolerated although as the name implies,\nthis will lead to the loss of information and thus should be\nused with care. Some data are more amenable to com-\npression than others, and a careful analysis should be car-\nried out in advance to determine the worth of applying data\ncompression because it comes with some time, cost, and a\nlittle additional complexity to the spacecraft operations.\n\nThe operability of the payload can have a significant\nimpact on the payload design. Complex payloads require\nmore complex operational procedures that, in turn, require\nsophisticated software and additional mechanisms with\nassociated increase in the on-board computing, mass, and\npower needs. This all adds to the cost of the mission by\nincreasing the verification and validation load, and raises\nthe risk. Conversely, the push for complex payloads to\nimprove the flexibility of the operations will increase the\ndata load and lead to compromises or trades being made\nwhich may impact the ability to meet the measurement\nrequirements. Operating the payload, then, becomes a driver\nof the design process.\n\nPayload operations can be classified in a number of ways\nbut the most common are: survey payloads, event-driven\npayloads, and adaptive payloads [65]. As their names sug-\ngest, survey payloads have relatively simple operations and\nat their most basic they rely on repeating the same suite of\nobservations or operations each orbit, event-driven payloads\nare designed to make a series of operations at specific points\nin their orbit or at given times of year, and so their operations\ntend to be more complex, often requiring accurate time\nmanagement and variable spacecraft pointing, adaptive\npayloads are the most complex as they are required to\nrespond to changing circumstances that either naturally occur\nor are commanded as part of the mission plan.\n\nEach operations concept must include planning, sched-\nuling, commanding, data management, spacecraft support\n(e.g. roll maneuver), and response to physical conditions or\nevents. The more complex the planned operations the more\ndetailed the operations concept has to be. In addition, all of\nthe operations must be performed while meeting the various\nperformance and measurement requirements. In designing\nthe payload operability, one of the biggest decisions is\nwhether to adopt autonomous or commanded operations\n(sometimes a mix). As discussed, some of these decisions\nare influenced by the nature of the measurements to be\nmade, their purpose (e.g. real-time response), and the vol-\nume to be transmitted. Additional factors include spacecraft\ncapability, telemetry, orbit, data fidelity, etc. These con-\nsiderations also require relating the payload design to the\nground support (see Chap. 20).\n\n6 Payload Design and Sizing 133\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_20\n\n\nMeasurements are only as good as the level of trust\nplaced in them, and the measurement requirements provide\nthe necessary definitions to guarantee sufficient fidelity to\nmeet the operational goals of the mission. A high signal-to-\nnoise ratio and a low data error rate have already been\nidentified as possible drivers of the payload design. How-\never, adequate calibration of the signal must be provided to\nhave confidence in the measurements being made. Cali-\nbration of spatial resolution, wavelength, pointing accuracy,\nspacecraft maneuvers, together with assessment of dark\ncurrent and flat field levels (e.g. for CCD imagers) are all\nnecessary and should be performed at regular intervals\nduring the design phase and while in space.\n\nGround calibration is often performed at the subsystem\nor individual instrument level prior to integration of the\npayload with the spacecraft. In addition, in space calibra-\ntions are important and can utilize calibration sources\nincluded specifically for this purpose or regular observa-\ntions of natural calibration sources. For instruments where\nneither of these is possible, external calibrations can be\ndeveloped. For example, the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging\nTelescope (EIT) on board the Solar and Heliospheric\nObservatory (SOHO) spacecraft has utilized specially\ndesigned sounding rocket calibration flights, the EIT Calroc\n[66], to perform benchmark calibrations of the EIT detec-\ntors. The rockets incorporate a copy of the EIT space optics\nand collect sufficient data during their operation to calibrate\nagainst observations by the contemporaneous and identi-\ncally designed SOHO EIT. This has allowed for a number\nof calibration updates over the course of the mission since\nits launch in 1995.\n\nCalibration is an important component of the instrument,\npayload, and spacecraft design. The level, number and\ncomplexity of the various calibrations can interrupt the\nregular operations of the payload, add to the complexity of\nthe design, increase the data volume, and add cost, but they\nare essential.\n\n6.3.3 Spacecraft Requirements\n\nThe payload is, of course, part of a larger system, and is\nreliant on other parts of this system for its successful\noperation. In addition to supporting the payload structure,\nproviding power, removing heat, and supplying a host of\nother resources to keep the payload operating, the spacecraft\nalso provides crucial capability to enable the payload to\nmeet its operational goals and to satisfy its measurement\nand performance requirements.\n\nThe spacecraft generally provides the command, control,\nand data handling that is critical for the operation of the\npayload and the recovery of the data that it collects. This is\ndiscussed in detail in the previous section and while\n\nimportant, it does not directly contribute to the taking of\nmeasurements. Instead, here, the focus is on spacecraft\nmaneuverability and attitude control, which are critically\nrelated to the ability of the payload to make the measure-\nments to meet its operational goals.\n\nSpacecraft attitude control, the precision to which it can\nhold a given attitude, and the accuracy of the knowledge of\nits attitude, all directly affect observations made by the\npayload, particularly for payloads focused on target acqui-\nsition (e.g. imaging the Earth or an astrophysical object, and\nfixed station-keeping for continuous communications or\nsurveillance). The ability of a spacecraft to provide a given\nlevel of pointing control and the stability to maintain a\ngiven position can drive the design of the payload control\nmechanisms, either to provide a finer tuning of the pointing\nor to control the effects of spacecraft jitter. In remote\nsensing payloads, there is often an important trade to be\nmade between the capability of the spacecraft to control the\npointing stability and the inclusion of an image stabilization\ncapability as part of the payload. Depending on the required\npointing stability, a substantial reduction in cost and com-\nplexity can be realized by having the payload carry some of\nthe stabilization requirements.\n\nAttitude determination and control can be accomplished\nin a number of ways, each of which affects the payload\ndesign differently. Conversely, a specific measurement\nrequirement for the payload may affect the choice of atti-\ntude control system on the spacecraft. As will be discussed\nin Chap. 12, the most common approaches adopted for\nspacecraft attitude control are to spin-stabilize the entire\nspacecraft or to have specific 3-axis spacecraft control using\na combination of gyroscopes and either reaction wheels or\nthrusters. Other approaches may use gravity gradient sta-\nbilization in Earth orbit or magnetic torquers that react\nagainst the Earth\u2019s magnetic field to apply a torque to the\nspacecraft. Spin stabilization and gravity gradient control\ncan be largely passive, with overall spacecraft attitude\ncontrolled \u2018open loop\u2019 (spin period can be sensed with\nSun-sensors and controlled via thrusters). Three-axis sta-\nbilization requires a control loop, with the control signal\ncoming from a star tracker or camera, or via inertial sensors\nfor less precise control requirements.\n\nThe spacecraft attitude control system (ACS) points the\npayload at the target within the required tolerances (see the\ntraceability matrix discussion in Sect. 6.1). Finer control\nwithin the payload itself relies on additional instruments\nsuch as guide telescopes that provide fine pointing angular\nmeasurements (using known sources) and feed error signals\nto the ACS for spacecraft-level refinement of the pointing,\nas well as to an image stabilization system, if present. The\nimage stabilization system is used to correct for spacecraft\njitter that can smear high spatial resolution images, partic-\nularly during long exposure observations. Often payload-\n\n134 D. Alexander and N. Murphy\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_12\n\n\nbased image stabilization systems operate with a different\nfrequency bandwidth and correct for jitter at high frequen-\ncies that lie outside the bandwidth of the spacecraft ACS.\nFor solar observation missions, for example, either a guide\ntelescope can use the solar limb as the reference source or\npost-processing using feature-correlation tracking can be\nused to refine the pointing knowledge and remove space-\ncraft jitter.\n\nIn addition to accurate control and knowledge of the\nspacecraft attitude, the payload design may call for specific\nmaneuvers such as spacecraft roll, large-scale pointing\nshifts, say to a change in target or center of field-of-view, or\nstation-keeping. This adds complexity to the operations of\nthe spacecraft and needs to be designed in conjunction with\nother mission considerations, such as preserving ground\ncommunications, maintaining the power system, thermal\nenvironment, and so forth. For complex payloads with\nconflicting pointing requirements, the payload may contain\na scan platform to independently point one or more\ninstruments.\n\n6.3.4 Mission Constraints\n\nWhile the focus in this chapter is on the payload design,\nwith the overall space system design being discussed later\nin the handbook, the interdependency of the payload and\nmission can have significant consequences for the payload.\nSome mission drivers were discussed in the previous sec-\ntion. Here, some of the more important aspects of this\ninterdependency provide the focus for the discussion.\n\nVarious places throughout this chapter have discussed\nthe interfaces between the payload and the spacecraft and\nconsidered how some of the mission criteria impact the\ndesign. However, some constraints imposed by the mission\non the payload need further attention.\n\nThe most obvious area where the mission and payload\nintersect is in the choice of the orbit and/or trajectory. Many\nfactors that contribute to the orbit decision do not necessarily\ntake the performance or measurement requirements of the\npayload into consideration, e.g. choice of launch vehicle and\nlaunch date, maneuverability of spacecraft, ground-station\nsupport, health and safety considerations (especially for\nhuman space flight), etc., and the payload typically tries to\noptimize its operations to accommodate these restrictions.\nHowever, in many cases the orbit is defined by the payload\nrequirements, e.g. polar observations/communications, Sun-\nsynchronous or geostationary operations, specific flight tra-\njectory, etc., and then the design of payload goes hand-in-\nhand with the design of the orbit-related mission criteria.\n\nOne of the main issues associated with a specific orbit, in\naddition to satisfying the primary purpose of the mission, is\nthe impact on the operations of the payload. For example,\n\nLEO limits up/downlink connections to brief and separated\npass times, leading to more complex operations. However,\nLEO is easier, and so cheaper, to attain, allowing for larger\npayload masses to be considered. The radiation environ-\nment of LEO (outside of South Atlantic Anomaly passage)\nis more benign than other, higher, orbital choices, but the\nspace debris and ATOX environments are more hazardous.\nThe specific issues associated with each orbit/trajectory are\nmanageable, but not without due consideration and not\nwithout being accommodated in the payload design. Higher\nshielding against radiation for geostationary orbits, sched-\nuling more ground station passes for LEO, and better sta-\ntion-keeping control, can all be factored into the payload\ndesign and operations to maintain required performance\nlevels within the given orbit.\n\nThe payload sensitivities also play a role in the space-\ncraft operations and these also vary for specific orbits. In\nparticular, for LEO, passage through the South Atlantic\nAnomaly when the radiation environment is particularly\nintense, requires, in some cases a different operational mode\nfor the payload, requiring lower resolution observations,\napplication of a filter or shutter, or complete shutdown of\nthe operations (e.g. the Hubble Space Telescope). In addi-\ntion, operating during eclipse periods may require a modi-\nfied approach. Conversely, avoiding bright objects, like the\nSun, which may damage sensitive detectors designed for\nless intense illumination, becomes a factor that also varies\nwith orbit selection.\n\nInterplanetary trajectories pose their own problems\ndepending on whether the intention is to orbit a distant\nobject, flyby with imaging and environment measurements,\nsample and return, or landings. While consideration of these\nis predominantly in the purview of the mission operations,\nthey can significantly influence the payload in many ways:\ndata storage and transmission needs specific tailoring for the\nlow telemetry resulting from the large distances involved;\nautonomous control capability greatly simplifies the oper-\nability of the payload; transition from en route operations to\non-site operations, especially for very long flight times,\nincreases risk.\n\nAnother prominent mission constraint that is crucial to the\npayload is the health and safety status of the mission as a\nwhole. It is obviously important to monitor the general well-\nbeing of all systems and their interactions. The payload needs\nto be able to respond (either autonomously or by command)\nto a change in the spacecraft and/or mission conditions. This\nis generally known as fault management and is typically\ndesigned to be managed by the payload and spacecraft\nthrough procedures defined in the Interface Control Docu-\nment (ICD). The occurrence of an anomaly in the mission\nneeds to have an appropriate response in the payload. The\nmost common approach is to place the payload (and/or\nspacecraft) into a safehold state, also called safe-mode. When\n\n6 Payload Design and Sizing 135\n\n\n\nin safe-mode, all unnecessary mechanisms and autonomous\noperations are shut down except for the communication\nchannels with ground support. Once the anomaly or problem\nhas been diagnosed, its effect assessed, and, if need be, cor-\nrected, the payload can be \u2018recovered\u2019. Full and safe recovery\nfrom a safehold state is a further requirement imposed upon\nthe payload. A payload with a well-designed automatic safe-\nmode entry and recovery process can reduce the amount of\nhealth and safety monitoring required, thereby reducing the\ntime and cost of real-time operations.\n\nIn addition, building in a range of positive performance\nand operational margins into the payload can significantly\nreduce the level of payload monitoring. Having more power\ncapability in the spacecraft than required by the payload can\nmitigate problems with the power generation (damage to\nsolar panels for instance). Having a larger radiator, to\nremove excess thermal loads, than required for expected\noperational heat build-up can avoid detector damage. And\nso on. Typical margins for most spacecraft systems and\nsubsystems are targeted to be *30 %.\n\n6.4 Design Constraints\n\nWhile the general flow of the design process is to develop\nrequirements from the mission objectives (science goals, for\nexample) and determine payload operating requirements and\nsystem requirements from these, payload requirements are\nrarely formulated without some a priori understanding of the\nconstraints that a mission will face. In fact, such constraints\nare often key drivers on the design of a payload and the scope\nof the mission objectives. There are many constraints that are\nimposed on a given mission which vary with the particular\ngoal of the mission. Scientific, military, and commercial\npayloads suffer from disparate conditions imposed by the\nmission but some are common to all and can be illustrated\neffectively by considering the details of a specific class of\nmissions, for example NASA scientific missions.\n\nFor NASA missions, the most tightly constrained pay-\nloads are typically those for competitive missions (e.g. the\nExplorer, Discovery or New Frontiers programs), where a\nsingle principal investigator leads an entire mission inves-\ntigation. Many of these constraints are simple restrictions on\npayload resources, such as available bus voltages, but others\ncan form a complex trade space, for example mass could be\nconstrained by a combination of launch vehicle capability,\nmission destination, required power (translating to solar\narray mass), communication requirements (which drive\npower requirements and are driven by spacecraft-Earth\ndistance), etc. An example of how such a constraint is\ncommunicated to a mission is by a limited choice of launch\nvehicle capabilities, as in the 2011 NASA Explorer\nAnnouncement of Opportunity (AO).\n\nTable 6.4 shows a subset of the launch constraints for\nthis particular AO. In addition to maximum lift performance\nas a function of chosen orbit, each potential launch vehicle\nmay have different payload fairing volumes and could\nprovide different launch vibration environments. As can be\nseen from the table, there is a large range of available\nmaximum performance, with the actual available perfor-\nmance being potentially much less than this for any given\norbit, so the choice of orbit in such a constrained mission\ncould significantly affect the available payload mass by\nmany hundreds of kilograms. Thus, the science require-\nments that drive orbit choice can potentially severely limit\npayload options.\n\nIn determining the constraints that will be encountered\nby a particular payload, it is instructive to start by deter-\nmining the requirements that the payload will levy on the\noverall system by determining the payload mass, power,\ntelemetry bandwidth, on-board computing, thermal\nrequirements, etc. Within the payload, resources can\nsometimes be shared to minimize the system impact.\nExamples are shared low voltage power supplies (a single\npower converter to convert and condition bus voltages to\nthose required for digital circuits, or housing multiple\nelectronics cards in a single chassis) although careful\nengineering analysis is required to make sure such trades\nare feasible and don\u2019t introduce unwanted problems such as\nnoise in electronic systems.\n\nIt is important to note that the addition of a payload, or\npayload elements, will consume system resources above\nthese estimates. For example, increases in payload mass can\nresult in greater structural and propulsion system mass, and\nincreased power requirements translate into heavier power\nsystems. Subsequent phases of payload optimization take\nthese effects into consideration.\n\nDepending on mission type, these design trades can take\nplace at different times. For payloads where individual\ninstruments are solicited separately, payload resource opti-\nmization comes after instrument selection, but when the\npayload is solicited as a package, much optimization can\ntake place before selection. Similarly, when an entire mis-\nsion is competitively selected, significant design optimiza-\ntion can take place before the mission is selected for\nfunding. Experience with NASA competitive missions\nsuggests that this latter approach is a factor in reducing\noverall mission cost growth.\n\n6.5 Impact of Future Technology\nDevelopments\n\nThe mechanics of payload design have been honed and\nrefined over the years so that documents such as this can\nprovide most of the rudiments that apply to most payloads,\n\n136 D. Alexander and N. Murphy\n\n\n\nwith much of what\u2019s missing being applicable to payloads\nwith added complexity. As the technology of space explo-\nration advances and as we seek newer means of observing\nin space, the payload design process will have to adapt to\nmeet new challenges. In some cases, for example the low\npower, lightweight, electronics provided by nano-technol-\nogy, the design process may be simpler and more effective,\nwhereas in others, such as the need for cryogenic detectors,\nthe design may become significantly more complex. In this\nsection, some future technology needs and their impact on\nthe payload are highlighted. This is by no means an\nexhaustive list nor is there space to be comprehensive but\nthere is hopefully enough to give a flavor of how important\ninnovation is in designing space systems.\n\n6.5.1 Power Technology\n\nFor many payloads, one of the major system drivers is the\npower that they need. Issues of sizing the solar arrays,\nsizing the batteries, sharing the available power between all\nof the systems demanding it, and maintaining these\nresources throughout the mission lifetime all have to be\naddressed without exceeding the resources available to the\nmission. To-date most of the effort in making more effective\nuse of on-board power has centered on the development of\nlow power mechanisms and instruments, rather than on the\npower generation. A number of recent advances are point-\ning the way to more efficient power generation and use\nwhich, in turn, may facilitate the use of more complex\npayloads.\n\nTwo ways in which the power management of a space\nmission can be significantly improved is to provide more\npower per unit area of solar panel and to provide more\nefficient batteries for storage of the incident solar energy.\nRecent breakthroughs in the field of nano-technology are\ngetting closer to providing systems of the scale required for\nuse in space payloads.\n\nNano-technology research has led to the development of\nsolar panels in which nano-designed particles, known as\nquantum dots, replace the silicon wafers in the panel\nsemiconductor. Quantum dots are efficient at capturing\nphotons and converting their energy to electrical current,\n\nwith tetrapod geometries proving to be amongst the most\nefficient. Tetrapods have the unique geometry of always\nhaving an axis pointing outwards, increasing the light\nabsorption in the solar panel. Tetrapod-infused solar panels\ncan potentially increase the energy conversion efficiency to\nas high as 70 % compared to the current value of around\n20 % [67]. Currently, the maximum energy conversion\nefficiencies of tetrapods are around 10 %, significantly\nlower than their silicon counterparts. This is due, in part, to\nthe difficulty in manufacturing \u2018true\u2019 tetrapods where each\nleg is the same size. However, new techniques are being\ndeveloped that are increasing the number of tetrapods in a\ngiven sample to around 90 %, paving the way for more\nefficient cheaper solar power generation.\n\nGenerating more power for a given size of solar panel\nwill clearly have a major impact on space missions. How-\never, nano-technology is also attacking the power problem\nfrom a different direction, namely the ability to significantly\nincrease power storage. In recent years, a new carbon-based\nmaterial known as graphene has revolutionized our thinking\nabout a wide range of electronic applications. In particular,\nthe production of graphene-based ultracapacitors [68] for\nuse in space-based power storage has a huge advantage over\ntraditional batteries in that they have a higher power\ncapability (more than ten times the capacity), live longer\nwith less maintenance, operate over a wider range of tem-\nperatures, and are lighter and more flexible, making them\nvery useful for compacting into a given spacecraft design.\n\nAnother technology being developed to generate the\npower necessary to operate a spacecraft is that of the Stir-\nling radioisotope generator (SRG). This uses heat from\nradioactive decay to drive a Stirling engine which rapidly\nheats helium to drive a piston, the motion of which is used\nto generate electricity. SRGs produce four times as much\npower as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in opera-\ntion at the present time (e.g. [19] ). Typically, pellets of\nPu-238 provide the radiation to heat the Stirling engine with\na resulting output of around 140 W with about 30 % effi-\nciency. SRGs can weigh around 30 kg but this is mitigated\nby the fact that the power is available continuously, without\nconstraints from spacecraft orientation, distance from the\nSun, or shadowing on a planetary surface. SRGs are in\ndevelopment for possible future use in missions to the outer\n\nTable 6.4 Maximum launch vehicle capabilities provided with the NASA Explorer 2011 announcement of opportunity\n\nLaunch site Assumed inclinations Altitude range (km) Maximum performance (kg)\n\nCCAFS 28.5?\u201351.6? 200\u20132,000 1,585\n\nKLC 70?\u201390?, SunSynch 200\u20132,000 1,640\n\nRTS 0?\u201390?, SunSynch 200\u20132,000 855\n\nVAFB 60?\u201390?, SunSynch 200\u20132,000 1,390\n\nWFF 45? 200\u20132,000 1,435\nThis table shows a subset of the available capability\n\n6 Payload Design and Sizing 137\n\n\n\nplanets and their moons, where solar panels provide mini-\nmum power due to their distance from the Sun, and for\nplanetary surface use, where maintaining operation at night\n(and avoiding freezing) is required.\n\nThese technologies show great promise but are many\nyears short of being space-ready. However, once developed\nthey will significantly enhance the capability and flexibility\nof a spacecraft to provide power which, in turn, will\nenhance the capability of any payload. More efficient power\ngeneration reduces the mass required for solar panels or\nincreases the power generation for a given mass, while more\ncapable energy storage allows for more flexible operations,\ne.g. longer \u2018night-time\u2019 operations when the spacecraft is\nout of direct sunlight, more on-board processing capability\nduring operational downtime, and longer emergency life-\ntime in the event of problems. Improving the power capa-\nbility of a space mission reduces the impact of one of the\nmajor factors that constrains the design and sizing of a\npayload. For further discussion on spacecraft electric power\nsystems see Chap. 10.\n\n6.5.2 Advanced Propulsion\n\nThroughout the Space Age, we have relied almost entirely\non chemical propulsion to put us into orbit or onto inter-\nplanetary trajectories, with the odd variant on liquid or solid\npropellant with occasional use of ion drives for propulsion\nor station-keeping. However, chemical propulsion is rela-\ntively inefficient, heavy, and of limited flexibility. Chemi-\ncally propelled missions that are not in the ecliptic plane, go\nagainst the Earth\u2019s orbital direction, or require complex\ntrajectories, including returning to Earth, have to carry so\nmuch fuel that the launch costs climb sharply and the mass\navailable to the spacecraft and payload is severely limited.\nGravitational assists are frequently used to minimize the\namount of fuel needed but these can add to the mission\nduration and lengthen the time to attain operational orbit. A\nnumber of alternative propulsion approaches have been\ndeveloped and have even been demonstrated in flight, but\nthey are a long way short of being the propulsion of choice.\nEach of them is unique and provides benefits and challenges\nfor the payloads they carry.\n\nSolar electric ion propulsion is a proven technology that\ncan propel a spacecraft to velocities ten times as large as\nconventional chemical rockets with an equivalent amount of\nfuel. Specific impulse (see Sect. 4.5.3) is about 10 times that\nof chemical propulsion. The low thrust produced prohibits\nrapid accelerations but provides a relatively gentle platform\nfor hosting a payload. The high efficiency of an ion pro-\npulsion system makes it a strong candidate for space mis-\nsions with either a high-energy requirement or frequent or\ncontinuous maneuvering. An ion propulsion system was\n\nflown with great success on Deep Space-1 (DS1), a tech-\nnology demonstration mission of NASA\u2019s New Millennium\nProgram [38, 69] and on NASA\u2019s Dawn mission to the\nasteroids Vesta and Ceres [70]. In the case of DS1 the ion\nthrusters were in continuous operation for almost 2 years\nand produced a velocity in excess of 4.3 km/s. Sensitive to\nthe potential effects on a payload from the ion engine, DS1\nalso carried a set of diagnostic instruments designed to\nquantify the interactions of the ion propulsion system with\nthe spacecraft. Diagnostic measurements that were made\nincluded the rate and extent of contamination around the\nspacecraft from the ion plume (Xe+) and the sputtered\nmaterial from the grid, the generation of electric and mag-\nnetic fields, and the density and energy of electrons and ions\nin the vicinity of the spacecraft. All of these interactions\ncould potentially interfere with the working of the payload,\ncontaminate measurements of the local environment or\ninterfere with communications to ground stations. The\ndiagnostic tests carried out over the course of the DS1\nmission did not indicate any undue effects of the ion drive\non the instrument function nor on their operation.\n\nAnother promising technology for high velocity space\nmissions is the development of solar sails, also discussed in\nSects. 11.9.2 and 24.8. Solar sails are large, lightweight,\nreflective mirrors that use the light from the Sun as a form\nof propulsion [71]. The key property that defines the per-\nformance of the sail is its areal density (g/m2). A low areal\ndensity can result in high accelerations, smaller sail size for\na given mass constraint, or larger payload mass carried for a\ngiven sail size. High performance sails with areal densities\n\\1 g/m2 can effectively defy gravity and enable a wide\nrange of non-Keplerian, high-energy orbits and trajectories.\nPotential applications include sample returns,\nout-of-the-ecliptic orbits, polar \u2018hover\u2019 missions over\nplanets or the Sun, and even interstellar missions. In 2011,\nthe Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) flew a demonstration\nsolar sail mission, IKAROS, with a square sail that was\n20 m across the diagonal when fully deployed [36]. The sail\nwas made from a 7.5-micron thick polyimide substrate and\nused embedded electrochromic panels to change the\nreflectance for attitude control. It was a relatively low\nperformance sail, but it successfully tested both propulsion\nand attitude control for the first time in space for such a\ndevice. IKAROS also tested thin film solar cells, integrated\ninto the solar sail film, with the ultimate goal of producing a\ndual solar sail, ion propulsion system. More capability can\nbe obtained by increasing the sail size to achieve acceler-\nations sufficient to enable high-energy missions. A major\nissue associated with using large solar sails for propulsion is\nthe potential constraints on the payload operations. In order\nfor a solar sail to be effective it must be as flat as possible to\nmake maximum use of the incoming photons. This is\naccomplished by maintaining a tension on the film of the\n\n138 D. Alexander and N. Murphy\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_24\n\n\nsail and this is generally done by either attaching the sail to\ndeployable booms or using the centrifugal force to deploy a\ncircular sail with the spin of the spacecraft maintaining the\nsail tension. In the former scenario a 3-axis stabilized\nspacecraft is sufficient whereas a spinning, or dual spin,\nspacecraft is required in the latter. This feeds directly into the\npayload design. In addition, the space environment is per-\nvaded by energetic charged particles, magnetic fields,\nplasma, dust, micrometeoroids, and debris, all of which can\ninteract with the sail as it moves through the interplanetary\nmedium. These interactions can have a number of potentially\ndeleterious effects on mission operations and measurement\ncontamination. A potential source of measurement pertur-\nbations is the charging of the sail material due to solar\nultraviolet radiation [72] and plasma interactions. The\naccumulation of charge resulting from these processes can\ngenerate substantial potentials that then increase the inter-\naction with the solar wind, changing the plasma environment\naround the spacecraft. Strategies for the measurement of the\nproperties of the \u2018undisturbed\u2019 ambient medium need to be\nfactored into the design of the payload: use of extendable\nbooms, measurements made in the shade of the sail, etc.\n\nThe capability provided by these advanced propulsion\ntechniques is exciting as new mission concepts can be\ndevised which go far beyond those available with chemical\npropulsion (polar hovers over the Sun and the planets,\ninterstellar missions, sample returns, rapid transit between\nEarth and Mars to name a few). The range of possible\nmissions allows for innovative mission objectives with their\nassociated impact on the payload. For further discussion on\nspacecraft propulsion systems see Chap. 11.\n\n6.5.3 Deployable Systems\n\nPayload sizes are limited by the ability of the launch vehicle\nto get them into orbit. In addition to mass constraints, there\nare also length and volume constraints. The size of the\npayload is therefore limited and, as a result, so is the\ncapability. For telescopes, space adds the advantage of zero-\natmosphere to limit the \u2018seeing\u2019, while providing access to\nwavelengths not observable on the ground. However, the\ndevelopment of increasingly sophisticated adaptive optics\nschemes for ground-based telescopes means that the early\nadvantages of observing from space with 0.5 and 1 meter-\nscale telescopes are no longer relevant, and certainly not an\neffective use of the money that it costs to launch them. In\naddition, as advancing technology enables observation of\nfainter or more distant objects or to higher resolutions, the\nneed for larger and larger telescopes and antennas increases.\nThe trick to overcome this apparent impasse is the appli-\ncation and implementation of deployable systems such as\ninflatable or extendable structures.\n\nExamples of deployable structures include solar sails,\nlarge area optics, extendable instrument or support booms,\nsolar concentrators, and large antennas. The development of\nall of these structures is ongoing to meet particular needs in\nthe space community for military, commercial, and scien-\ntific purposes. Large area optics are of particular interest, as\nthey will help overcome the current limitations of space-\nbased telescopes and lead to significant improvements in the\nlight gathering power with consequent improvements in\nresolution. Very large antennas have been proposed for a\nnumber of applications including larger bandwidth tele-\ncommunications, very long baseline interferometry, and\nspace-based radar.\n\nThe obvious impact of such deployable systems on the\npayload design is the accommodation of the deployment\nmechanism, the additional support structure for the deployed\nsystem, and the control of, and communications between, the\npayload hub and the sensors, cameras or other instrumenta-\ntion distributed throughout the deployed mass. A deployable\nstructure on a spacecraft is usually a direct requirement\ndesigned to meet one of more of the mission objectives and as\nsuch drives the design of the payload. Decisions need to be\nmade as to whether the deployment mechanism serves any\nuseful purpose once the structure is deployed. In the case of\nsome solar sail missions, for example, once the spacecraft has\nreached its desired operational location, the sail itself can be\njettisoned. The torques created by a large deployed system,\nthe space charge that it builds up, and the disturbance it\nmakes in the medium it is traveling through, may all have a\ndirect effect on the operation, measurements, or observations\nof the payload instrumentation. This presents a number of\nadditional challenges in the design of the payload and its\ninterface with the parent spacecraft.\n\n6.5.4 Cryogenic Payloads\n\nA range of new sensor technologies are being developed that\nenable the detection of individual photons resulting in sig-\nnificantly higher sensitivities and, as a consequence, the\nability to provide high resolution simultaneously in space,\ntime, and energy. These single-photon detectors will signif-\nicantly advance the observational capability of telescopes in\nspace. These sensors rely on taking standard calorimetric\nmeasurement techniques into the milli-Kelvin temperature\nregime. When photons impact the detector their energy is\nconverted to heat that, with a significantly sensitive detector,\ncan be measured. Typically, a measureable amount of heat\nrequires a large number of incident photons that are in sparse\nsupply for faint objects or brighter objects that need to be\nhighly resolved in space or time. To detect single photons and\nthereby make efficient use of every photon, extremely sen-\nsitive calorimeters (micro-calorimeters) are required. Such\n\n6 Payload Design and Sizing 139\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_11\n\n\ncalorimeters must therefore be isolated from even the\nweakest sources of thermal background, from either space or\nthe spacecraft itself. This is where cryogenics comes in.\nSince the 1980s, the Stirling cooler has been the most popular\nmeans by which to maintain a low temperature on board a\nspace mission. Modern designs allow for temperatures of\n50\u201380 K with two-stage Stirling coolers getting down to\naround 20 K. For a mission like the Planck observatory [73],\nwhich measured the microwave background at 2.7 K, a series\nof cooling systems were required to get to a background\ntemperature of 0.1\u20130.3 K. This used a passive radiator to get\nto *60 K, an H2 Joule\u2013Thomson cooler to get to 20 K, a\nJoule\u2013Thompson mechanical cooler to get to 4 K, and then a\ndilution refrigerator to get to 0.1 K.\n\nThe goal is to get cryogenic temperature down to a few\ntens of milli-Kelvin. This can be achieved with adiabatic\ndiamagnetic refrigerators (ADR), which have an advantage\nover standard dilution refrigerators, whose pipelines can get\nclogged and whose systems rely on the evacuation of the\ncoolant (helium) into space, thereby requiring a significant\nmass of helium to be carried.\n\nA class of detectors, known as \u20183D detectors\u2019 [74] have\nbeen developed which operate in the tens of milli-Kelvin\nregime and allow single photon detections: hence the ability\nto simultaneously measure spatial, temporal, and spectral\ninformation. These cryogenic detectors rely on measuring the\nlow-energy solid-state excitations resulting from single\nphoton detections and so must be operated at temperature\nsignificantly below 1 K. Two examples of these micro-cal-\norimeters are transition-edge sensors (TES) and supercon-\nducting tunnel junctions (STJ). These detectors have\ndifferent operating principles but they are both photon\ncounting detectors with energy resolutions, E/dE, of around\n500, temporal resolutions of \\1 ms, and spatial resolutions\nonly limited by the size of the array that can be built. TES\ndetectors are based on the sharp resistive transition of a thin\nsuperconducting film and are typically operated at tempera-\ntures below 0.1 K. The sensors are connected to a thermal\nbath that is maintained at a temperature a little lower than this\noperating temperature using an ADR. The absorbed photon\nproduces a heat pulse that results in a transient decrease in the\nTES current, measured by a superconducting quantum\ninterference device (SQUID). STJ detectors rely on the cre-\nation of quasi-particles in one or both of two thin supercon-\nductor layers separated by a thin insulating tunneling layer.\nSTJs measure photon energies from the increase in tunneling\ncurrent after absorption in one of the superconductor layers\nexcites additional charge carriers above the superconducting\nenergy gap. In both cases active cooling is required.\n\nCryogenic micro-calorimeter technologies are paving the\nway for major advances in the observation of astrophysical\nphenomena, particularly at X-ray energies. However, the\naccommodation of the requisite cryogenic system provides a\n\nmajor challenge for the payload design. Typical ADR\ncryogenic systems have a mass of around 25\u201335 kg, com-\nparable to a complete instrument. In addition, the reliance on\nmagnetic fields for the cooling adds the need for shielding,\nwhich comes with an additional mass and size cost.\nAcknowledging this problem, ADRs are being developed\nwhich are small, with low mass and low power requirements\nand smaller less problematic magnetic fields, e.g. [75]. As\nmicro-calorimeter instruments become more common and\nthe potential science return increases, payloads will have to\nadapt to the increased reliance on cryogenic systems.\n\n6.6 Conclusions\n\nTo design and size a payload, the mission objectives must\nbe understood, along with how these flow down to the\nactual measurements to be made, instrument functional\nrequirements, and instrument operations to be performed.\nThis requires a detailed knowledge of how the payload will\noperate, how it interacts with the spacecraft, how it influ-\nences the mission operations, and how it is constrained by\nmission and spacecraft parameters (launch vehicle, fairing,\norbit, structure, mass etc.). In addition, external factors such\nas cost and schedule may influence the payload design and\nultimately lead to a change in the mission objectives. The\ncrucial element in successful payload design is effective\ncommunication between the payload designers, spacecraft\nsubsystem designers, and systems engineers. From early in\nthe payload design to its final integration, testing, and\nlaunch, it is important to maintain constant communication\nbetween the payload development and the various factors\nfeeding this development: science/operational objectives,\nmission capabilities, spacecraft design, technology imple-\nmentation, calibration, cost, schedule, and risk assessment.\nFrom the early design concepts to the final payload, the flow\nof information between the various mission teams is crucial\nin keeping to cost and schedule, minimizing problems, and\nmaximizing the final payload performance.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of payload design is\nthe attention that must be paid to the various sets of\nrequirements: mission, spacecraft, performance, and mea-\nsurement (see Fig. 6.3). It is a careful definition of these\nrequirements and their flowdown into the various subsys-\ntems that set the parameters for the final integrated payload.\nThe requirements can be modified as the design develops, to\ntake account of the many issues that crop up in the mission\ndevelopment, changing capability of the technologies,\nunforeseen design impasses, cost and schedule overruns,\netc. However, these can be minimized by a robust and clear\ndefinition early in the design, maintaining cost and schedule\ntargets and communicating any changes to the mission\nteams in a timely fashion.\n\n140 D. Alexander and N. Murphy\n\n\n\nThis chapter has attempted to detail the wide array of\nconsiderations that factor into the design of a payload,\nwhether it be a relatively simple transmitter in a geosta-\ntionary orbit or a complex scientific suite of instruments\nheading for a distant planet. This is a complicated task and a\nsingle chapter overview of the payload design process is no\nsubstitute for the level of step-by-step detail required to\nbuild a successful payload and to integrate it into a suc-\ncessful mission. Several excellent texts exist that provide\nthe necessary detail at the specific task level [2, 3, 65].\nHowever, it is important to also understand the context in\nwhich payloads must operate and this has provided the\nfocus for the present chapter.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nPart of the research and work that supported this chapter\nwas carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California\nInstitute of Technology, under a contract with the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Pisacane\n\nA space system consists of a complex set of synergistically\nrelated components that together satisfy a coherent set of\nrequirements derived from a set of needs. The objective of\nsystems engineering is to design, develop, deploy, operate,\nand dispose of a system that meets the user\u2019s needs, defined\nin terms of technical or performance specifications and\nconstraints such as cost, schedule, and risk that constitute a\nset of system-level requirements. Requirements at all levels\nshould be interpreted to include both technical requirements\nand constraints. Consequently, systems engineering is the\ninterdisciplinary systematic and concurrent development\nand verification of a product or service to satisfy the system-\nlevel requirements. Often, a system is viewed as an inde-\npendent entity, but in actuality, it will interact with other\nsystems and exist within the context of larger or super\nsystems. Systems are generally categorized hierarchically as\nconsisting successively of segments, elements, subsystems,\nassemblies, subassemblies, and parts. Segments, elements,\nand subsystems have explicit hierarchical requirements\nderived from system-level requirements. Consequently,\neach is often called a system as well. In this chapter the use\nof the term system is often intended to apply equally to\nsegment, element, or subsystem.\n\nSystems engineering was devised at the Bell Telephone\nLaboratories in the 1940s and was further developed by the\nUnited States Department of Defense, NASA, and other\nentities into a more formal discipline [1, 2]. Technological\nadvances that today permit the distributed development of\nincreasingly complex systems that require progressively\nincreasingly specialized skills have necessarily increased\nthe importance of and dependence on systems engineering\nto achieve a successful outcome. NASA and ESA continue\nto lead the way in developing space systems engineering\n\npractices through documented practices, training, and\nstandards, while the broader field of systems engineering is\nbeing developed by organizations such as the Electronics\nIndustry Association (EIA), International Council on Sys-\ntems Engineering (INCOSE), International Standards\nOrganization (ISO), and International Electrotechnical\nCommission (IEC).\n\nSystems engineering can be described as a formalized\nand disciplined approach to the development, deployment,\nutilization, and disposal of a system that satisfies specific\nneeds, formalized by a set of needs and technical require-\nments or specifications within the bounds of stringent\nconstraints. Thus, needs includes the characteristics of the\npotential work product and concomitant constraints. The\nsuccessful realization of systems engineering is a system\nthat satisfies the stated needs and balances the technical\nrequirements and constraints, with the latter often being\ncost, schedule, and risk. The role of the systems engineer\nbegins with an understanding of the needs, development of\nthe system requirements, and ends when the system is dis-\nposed of or decommissioned. In modestly sized projects\nthere may be one systems engineer, but in large, geo-\ngraphically distributed projects a team may be necessary.\nThe lead systems engineer must be cognizant of the overall\nengineering activities and play a critical role in developing\nthe systems engineering management plan (SEMP). His/her\nresponsibilities include leading the development of the\nsystem architecture, defining interfaces, allocating require-\nments among the subsystems, evaluating trade-offs,\nassessing risks, assuring verification and validation, leading\nsystem-level reviews, assessing subsystem reviews and\ntests, heading the configuration control board, and assuring\nproper documentation. Inadequate planning and failure to\nadhere to a formal systems engineering management plan\ncan lead to a failure to meet the requirements and specifi-\ncally to cost and schedule overruns.

Steps 1 through 9\nrepresent the sequence of tasks required to execute a pro-\nject, while steps 10 through 17 are crosscutting tools for\ncarrying out the processes to complete the development.\n\nUsing, for demonstration purposes, selected NASA\nprojects developed in the 1970s and 1980s, Fig. 7.3 illus-\ntrates the benefits of expenditures on the definition phases to\nreduce cost overruns. The definition costs are the actual\ncosts expended in steps 1 through 4 in Fig. 7.2 that include\nPhase A (Concept and Technology Development) and Phase\nB (Preliminary Design and Technology Completion) of the\ndevelopment life cycle. The target costs are the estimated\ncosts and the actual costs are the realized costs subsequent\nto the definition costs (i.e. subsequent to Phase B). The data\nin Fig. 7.3 suggest that the optimum expenditures during\nthe definition phases are in the vicinity of 15 % of the total\nproject estimate; however it is noteworthy that few data\npoints sit beyond 10 %. This appears to support the con-\ntention in systems engineering of the benefit from having\nwell-defined phases with clearly defined and vetted needs\nand hierarchical requirements.\n\nConsiderable information is available to help define and\nassist in the application of systems engineering. ISO/IEC-\n15288:2008 [6] defines a set of processes and terminologies\napplicable to any level in the hierarchy of the development\nprocess. For software development, the standard ISO/IEC-\n12207:2008 [7] may also be useful. Handbooks that\ndescribe the role and practices of systems engineering are\n\navailable from NASA/SP-2007-6105 [4], INCOSE [8], and\nECSS-E-HB-10 [9].\n\nA systems engineer must provide direction from tech-\nnical, management, and leadership perspectives. It is gen-\nerally accepted that a systems engineer will have a\nfoundational background in one of the traditional engi-\nneering disciplines (e.g., mechanical, electrical, industrial,\ncomputer engineering), experience as a lead engineer in the\ndevelopment of hardware subsystems, and additional\ntraining in systems engineering. A review of practicing\nsystems engineers would show a remarkable diversity in\ntheir education, experience, and career paths. Nonetheless,\ndisplayed in Table 7.1 are the characteristics that a systems\nengineer should possess, recognizing that no one single\nindividual could enjoy all of those identified.\n\n7.1 Concepts in Systems Engineering\n\nIn developing a sophisticated and complex system it is\nimportant that all participants work together in a coherent\nand synergistic manner. This is achieved through the Sys-\ntems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP), which docu-\nments how the technical and engineering activities are to be\ncarried out in a fully integrated manner. The SEMP gen-\nerally consists of ten sections, as illustrated in Table 7.2. Its\nobjective is to define the approaches, procedures, resources,\norganizational structures, levels of responsibilities, and\ncommensurate levels of authority used to address all aspects\nof each of the life cycles of the project. The systems\nengineer typically has the responsibility to develop the\n\nFig. 7.1 Systems engineering\nfunctions and boundaries, from\n[3]\n\n144 V. L. Pisacane\n\n\n\nSEMP but the document should integrate inputs from all\nparticipating organizations and groups, especially project\nmanagement. Specifics of the SEMP are given in NASA\nNPR 7123.1A, [10] and ECSS-E-ST-10C [3].\n\nSeveral procedural models are used to develop hardware-\nand software-intensive space systems, including the most\npopular waterfall and spiral development models. The\nwaterfall model comprises a phased progression of func-\ntions leading to the realization of the system. A number of\nvariants exist, with typical phases of the model illustrated in\nFig. 7.4. The waterfall model is most appropriate for pro-\njects with a limited number of realizations for which the\nrequirements are well defined at the beginning of the project\nand remain independent over time. Advantages include the\nemphasis on requirements and design prior to implemen-\ntation that are intended to reduce rework, and that the\nphases have defined entry and exit criteria so that progress\n\ncan be compartmented and the status quantitatively asses-\nsed. Deficiencies of the waterfall model are that require-\nments may not be sufficiently defined, requirements may\nchange over the development period, and errors made in the\nrequirements and design phases may not be discovered until\nlate in the project when remediation is costly. The appli-\ncation of the waterfall model to software development is\ndiscussed in Sect. 16.4.1.\n\nThe spiral development model consists of a series of\nphases that repeat themselves with increasing definition and\ncapabilities until the project has satisfied all the require-\nments and the system development is complete. A four-\nphase spiral development model is shown in Fig. 7.5, in\nwhich design, implementation, integration, and testing, are\niterated with increasing resolution in each cycle. Also\nillustrated is that spiral development may be viewed as the\nwaterfall model applied recursively. It is suited to projects\n\nFig. 7.2 The systems\nengineering engine, from [4]\n\nFig. 7.3 Correlation of\ndefinition phase expenditures and\nproject cost overruns from 32\nNASA Programs, from [5]\n\n7 Space Systems Engineering 145\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_16\n\n\nin which the initial requirements are not well established or\nmay change as a function of time, or when it is appropriate\nto deploy a system with limited capability on an interim\nbasis. Otherwise, the spiral model is expected to result in a\nlonger schedule and be more costly than the waterfall\nmodel. It is most appropriate for software development,\nwhere limited capability implementations may be more\neasily deployed and recursively enhanced, as opposed to\nhardware-intensive systems. The application of the spiral\nmodel to software development is discussed in Sect. 16.4.1.\n\nThe Interface Control Document (ICD) is a tool to assure\nthe development of a system according to a strict set of\nrequirements. The ICD is a structured means of communi-\ncating information about interfaces among design teams. It is\na formal document that is often the key element in a contract\nand the basis for legal action when it is believed that the\nproduct does not satisfy the specifications. The ICD should\nbe signed by at least one representative of each affected\nsubsystem and the systems engineer. Specifications in the\nICD are derived from the system-level requirements that are\noften specified in an Interface Requirements Documents\n(IRD). This document defines the interfaces between systems\n\nand not the characteristics of the relevant systems. Typically,\nthe ICD describes the interfaces to the lowest level; e.g.,\nvoltages and their tolerances, connector types, and data for-\nmats. A well-defined ICD allows the system under devel-\nopment to utilize only a simulator of the specified inputs and\nthe measurement of its outputs to carry out interface and\nperformance tests. The ICD is developed during the design\nphases and is formalized subsequent to the critical design\nreview. Once signed, changes should be adjudicated by the\nconfiguration control board. Employment of the ICD is\ndescribed in NASA/SP-2007-6105 [4] and ECSS-M-ST-40C\n[11]. A typical ICD format is given in Table 7.3.\n\nTrade or trade-off analyses are used in systems engi-\nneering to assure that the optimum system or subsystem is\ndeveloped. They are a systemic approach to balancing\nrequirements, especially performance, cost, schedule, and\nrisk. A well-recognized axiom in systems engineering is\nknown as the systems engineer\u2019s dilemma that states\n\u2022 To reduce cost/schedule at constant risk, performance\n\nmust be reduced.\n\u2022 To reduce risk at constant cost/schedule, performance\n\nmust be reduced.\n\nTable 7.1 Desirable characteristics of systems engineers\n\nCapabilities Technical Management Leadership\n\nGeneral Able to solve problems\nAccepts responsibility\n\nCan-do attitude\nDisciplined\n\nGood bidirectional communicator and listener\nHigh energy\n\nLearns independently\nMakes informed decisions\n\nTakes calculated risks\nThinks critically\n\nUnderstands systems engineering\nUnderstands the role of the systems engineer\n\nCan delegate\nListens effectively\n\nSelf confident\nOpen minded\n\nSpecific Diverse technical skills\nEngineering or physics education\nExperience with simulations\nHands on hardware experience\nKnows electrical engineering\nStrong technical experience in one or\nmore relevant areas\nWillingness to learn new\ntechnologies\n\nActs as a member of the supporting teams\nrather than above them\nAppreciates importance of programmatic\nperformance, schedule, and costs\nDelegates commensurate responsibilities and\nauthority\nPromotes teaming\nUnderstands key elements of program\nmanagement\nUses meetings efficiently and effectively\n\nHas support of upper management\nFocuses on the big picture\nWilling to delegate both\nresponsibility and authority\nAppreciates importance of team\ncohesion\nExhibits personal accountability\nand expects it of others\nPromotes teaming\nSets and displays high standards\n\n146 V. L. Pisacane\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_16\n\n\n\u2022 To reduce cost/schedule at constant performance, higher\nrisks must be accepted.\n\n\u2022 To reduce risk at constant performance, higher costs and\na longer schedule must be accepted.\nTo effectively carry out a trade-off analysis requires a\n\nthorough understanding of the requirements of the project.\nBased on this, various alternative mission concepts, archi-\ntectures, and subsystems can be proposed, each of which can\nbe modeled throughout its life cycle phases. This is generally\naccomplished recursively. Sometimes it is appropriate to\nreach a decision by identifying and comparing the advanta-\nges and disadvantages of each alternative. However, a more\nformal approach is often used based on a priori weights that\nsum to unity for a set of a priori defined metrics. The metric is\n\na measure for quantitatively assessing a desirable or unde-\nsirable characteristic. Positive weights can be used for\ndesirable metrics and negative values for undesirable met-\nrics. Once the metric quantities are determined from mod-\neling each candidate alternative, they may be combined to\ndetermine an overall assessment. The weighted metrics are\ngenerally combined linearly or multiplicatively, although\nother techniques can also be used. The weighted linear\napproach is the most commonly used method. It is advanta-\ngeous when a low value for one or more metrics for mission\ncritical functions cannot be offset by other high value metrics.\nDuring the trade-off analysis it is often advisable to perform a\nsensitivity analysis to examine whether changes to the\nrequirements would make an important difference in the\noutcomes. If so, these trade-offs can be offered as potential\nalternatives for consideration by program management.\n\nTechnology readiness levels (TRL), discussed in Chap. 2\nand illustrated in Fig. 2.10, are the quantitative assessments\nof the maturity of the technology of a system, subsystem, or\nassembly. TRLs are a useful tool to facilitate the systematic\nprocess of transitioning a technology from the research and\ndevelopment phase to the operational phase. As such, they\nidentify technical risk by enumerating the number of levels\nthat a technology must survive to be considered mature and\noperationally vetted. The more numerous the lower TRLs\nplanned for a system, indicating reliance on less mature\n\nTable 7.2 Contents of a typical systems engineering management plan\n\nSection Content\n\nPurpose and scope Defines project and provides purpose, scope, and overview of the SEMP\n\nApplicable documents Provides references and project documentation\n\nTechnical summary Provides executive summary of the mission and system to be developed.

Throughout the\ndevelopment of a system, a critical resource has several\nassessments that include an initial estimate, a current esti-\nmate, and an allowed magnitude. The magnitudes of the\ncritical resources often tend toward the allowed magnitude as\nthe project matures. It is important to track critical resources\nso that they can be evaluated to determine if corrective action\nis anticipated or needed for those that are approaching their\nallowed magnitudes. The margin or contingency of a critical\nresource is the difference between the allowed magnitude\nand the current estimate, with the percent margin or contin-\ngency being the margin divided by the current estimate times\n100. The growth is the difference between the current esti-\nmate and the initial estimate, with the growth factor being the\ncurrent estimate divided by the initial estimate. Mass growth\nfactors and power growth factors of 1.1 to 1.2 are not unu-\nsual. An anticipated contingency factor is an a priori estimate\nof the typical growth of a critical resource whose value is\nbased on its current state of maturity. Anticipated contin-\ngency factors for typical growths for mass as a function of the\nresource\u2019s maturity are given in Table 7.4. The less mature\nthe item the greater is the contingency factor.\n\nFig. 7.5 Spiral development\nmodel\n\nTable 7.3 Sample template for an interface control document\n\n1.

Pisacane\n\n\n\n7.2 Project Development Life Cycle\n\nAs introduced in Chap. 2, major space systems are generally\ndeveloped according to a project life cycle model that con-\nsists of distinct phases, each of which has identified and\ncategorized activities that must be completed to produce\nspecified deliverables. Partitioning the project life cycle into\nphases has the advantage that each phase is built on a\ncompleted prior stage with specified deliverables that have\nbeen independently reviewed and evaluated. In addition,\ndecision points between phases represent go or no-go deci-\nsion points for management. The project life cycle phases as\ndefined by ECSS and NASA are listed in Table 2.2.\n\nPre-Phase A or Phase 0 generally consists of formulating\na program and identifying potential missions, supported by\nadvanced studies comprising analyses, simulations, and\nsome limited research or exploratory developments. The\nprimary objectives are to formulate relevant missions,\nmission goals, system-level requirements, preliminary\nconcept of operations, preliminary costs, and preliminary\nschedules and identify technologies that need to be devel-\noped. Often an interdisciplinary science working group with\nbroad participation is used to help establish the program-\nmatic scientific objectives.\n\nPhase A comprises the conceptual formulation of a spe-\ncific project and may be in response to a solicitation, to meet\na user\u2019s needs, or with the intent to develop an unsolicited\nproposal. The primary activities include defining the overall\nmission; refining the needs; developing system-level\nrequirements; developing one or more conceptual designs;\nidentifying needed research, exploratory developments, and\nlong-lead items; defining an initial concept of operations;\nand developing an initial schedule and cost estimate.\n\nPhase B consists of selecting the optimum design from\nthose identified in Phase A, if there are several, and carrying\nout preliminary designs of the mission and system and its\ndeployment, operation, and disposal. These preliminary\ndesigns are characterized by sufficient detail on which to base\nfirm estimates of performance, operational characteristics,\nrisk, cost, and schedule. The major go or no-go decision for a\nproject is generally made after the completion of Phase B.\n\nPhases C and D are generally integrated. In Phase C the\ndesign is finalized as a critical design in sufficient detail so\nthat fabrication can follow, substantiated by critical design\nreviews at the subsystem and system levels. Following a\nsuccessful system critical design review, the design is fro-\nzen and fabrication is initiated in Phase D, which comprises\nfabrication, assembly, integration, verification, and valida-\ntion at the subsystem and system level followed by\ndeployment of the system in its operational environment.\n\nPhase E constitutes operation of the system and involves\nits maintenance and the continued training of the operators\nand maintenance of the ground segment.\n\nPhase F includes decommissioning and documentation\nof the system\u2019s overall performance.\n\nFigure 7.6 expands on Fig. 2.9 and illustrates the NASA\nlife cycle phases and the phased major events and life cycle\ngates that need to be successfully met. The reviews iden-\ntified are discussed in Sect. 1.4.\n\nThe purpose, typical activities, products, and reviews at\nthe end of each phase are given in more detail in Table 7.5.\n\nDifferent life cycle strategies are generally employed for\nnon-flight programs such as basic and applied research and\nadvanced technology development, depending on the nat-\nure, complexity, and the technology readiness level. These\nprojects often follow the model of formulate, approve,\nimplement, and evaluate, as illustrated in Fig. 7.7.\n\n7.3 Needs and Requirements\n\nThe first stage in determining a specific set of requirements\nor specification is a needs assessment or needs analysis.\nThis identifies the characteristics of the work product and\nassociated constraints, and it must be independent of any\nproposed solution, focusing instead on identifying strengths,\nweaknesses, opportunities, advantages, constraints, and\nthreats. The assessment should be documented, and\naccompanied by any analyses performed with a set of\ncoherent performance needs and constraints, along with\nmeasures of effectiveness or performance. The needs\nassessment should be formally vetted by the stakeholders.\n\nTable 7.4 Anticipated contingency factors\n\nMaturity Anticipated contingency factors\n\nOff the shelf or measured 1.05\n\nMinor modification of an existing design 1.07\n\nModification of existing design 1.10\n\nNew design, calculated mass 1.15\n\nNew design, with thoughtful estimated mass 1.20\n\nNew design, with high uncertainty in estimated mass 1.30\n\n7 Space Systems Engineering 149\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_2\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_2\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_2\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_1\n\n\nThe needs assessment must specify the what but not the\nhow. Once the needs have been established they can be\ntransformed into system-level requirements that include\ntechnical requirements or specifications and constraints.\n\nThe system-level requirements initially developed from\nthe needs assessment specify as precisely as possible a\ndescription of the desired properties of the system and their\nconstraints independently of how they are to be realized.\nThey, as all requirements, should be definable, realizable,\nmeasurable, and verifiable. Inadequate, incomplete, impre-\ncise, unclear, conflicting, and unrealizable requirements will\ninvariably lead to difficulty in the later phases of the project.\nEach requirement should be quantitative and accompanied\nby tolerances, justifications, assumptions, and be observable\nand, therefore, measurable.\n\nThe system-level requirements should be categorized as\ntechnical requirements, such as performance, operation,\nreliability, safety, environmental, human factors, maintain-\nability, usability, testability, supportability, producibility,\netc. and constraints, such as cost, schedule, regulations,\npolicies, and so forth.\n\nAn appropriate set of requirements establishes the basis\nof agreement among participants, reduces rework activities,\nprovides a basis for estimating cost and schedule, and\nprovides a baseline for verification and validation. Char-\nacteristics of good requirements include\n\u2022 Clarity\u2014are they concise, unambiguous, and consisting\n\nof one requirement per statement?\n\u2022 Completeness\u2014does each one stand alone, are all\n\nassumptions given with tolerances, and is the sum suffi-\ncient to satisfy the needs?\n\n\u2022 Compliance\u2014are the requirements at the correct level\n(system, segment, element, subsystem, etc.) and inde-\npendent of the implementation?\n\n\u2022 Consistency\u2014are the requirements non-contradictory and\nis the terminology consistent?\n\n\u2022 Traceability\u2014are the requirements at a lower level\ntraceable to those at a higher level, for example, can the\nsubsystem requirements be related to specific system-\nlevel requirements?\n\n\u2022 Correctness\u2014are the technical requirements technically\nfeasible, with specified assumptions, and are relevant\nanalyses provided?\n\n\u2022 Interfaces\u2014are all interfaces clearly defined?\n\u2022 Reliability\u2014are reliability requirements clearly defined?\n\u2022 Verifiability\u2014are the requirements sufficiently specific to\n\nbe verifiable?\n\nDevelopment of detailed system-level requirements is\ninitiated by a functional decomposition and analysis activ-\nity. Functional decomposition and analysis is the systematic\nrecursive process that identifies, characterizes, and inter-\nrelates the hierarchical functions that a system must carry\nout in order to satisfy the system-level requirements. Each\nsystem-level requirement is analyzed to identify the specific\nfunctions that need to be carried out. Explicitly excluded is\nhow the functions are to be performed. These characteristics\nare generally achieved by recursive and iterative procedures\nthat involve a thorough understanding of the needs, system-\nlevel requirements, and the technical state-of-the-art. This\nprocess will also often reveal requirements that would not\nhave been otherwise identified.\n\nFig. 7.6 NASA life cycles with major events and life cycle gates, from [10]\n\n150 V. L. Pisacane\n\n\n\nThe functional architecture, generally developed first\nthrough the top-down process, specifies and describes each\nsystem-level function to be carried out. This is followed by\nthe creation of functional flow block diagrams that illustrate\nthe sequence and timelines for all system functions. Each\nblock diagram should represent a single function to be per-\nformed, described by its function, inputs, outputs, con-\nstraints, and interfaces. A consistent numbering scheme\nshould be used to relate hierarchically each functional block\ndiagram. A timeline analysis is used to relate the sequencing\nand duration of each of the functions. Once accomplished at\nthe top level, the functional decomposition and analysis for\neach identified function can be developed at sequentially\n\nmore detailed levels, with an appropriate hierarchical num-\nbering scheme. The results of this activity are more detailed\nsystem and lower-level requirements or specifications, the\nsystems architecture with component requirements for each\nfunction, and a concept of operations, or ConOps, that col-\nlectively describes the system architecturally and opera-\ntionally. Figure 7.8 illustrates an example of the functional\nflow block diagram to the third level.\n\nThe interfaces between functional blocks can be repre-\nsented by an n-square diagram; see Fig. 7.9. Functional\nblocks from the functional flow block diagrams are placed\nalong the diagonal representing the functions to be carried\nout. Off-diagonal blocks represent the functional interfaces\n\nTable 7.5 NASA life cycle phases, modified from [4]\n\nPhase Purpose Products\n\nFormulation Pre-Phase A\nConcept Studies\n\nProduce a broad spectrum of ideas and alternatives\nfor missions from which new programs/projects can\nbe selected\nDetermine feasibility of desired system\nDevelop mission concepts\nDraft system-level requirements\nIdentify potential technology needs\n\nFeasible system concepts in the form of\nsimulations, analysis, study reports, models,\nand mockups\n\nPhase A\nConcept and\nTechnology\nDevelopment\n\nDetermine feasibility and desirability of a\nsuggested new major system\nEstablish an initial baseline\nDevelop mission concept\nDevelop system-level requirements\nIdentify needed technology developments\nPass conceptual design review\n\nMission objectives\nSystem-level requirements\nMission conceptual design\nMission architecture\nMission operational plan\nConceptual subsystem requirements\nTechnology requirements\nSchedule and cost\n\nPhase B\nPreliminary Design\nand Technology\nCompletion\n\nEstablish an initial baseline\nDevelop preliminary mission architecture\nDevelop preliminary operational plan\nDevelop preliminary system requirements\nDevelop preliminary subsystem requirements\nDevelop a preliminary subsystem design\nDevelop schedule and cost\nDemonstrate feasibility\nPass preliminary design review\n\nMission objectives\nSystem-level requirements\nMission preliminary design\nMission architecture\nMission operational plan\nPreliminary subsystem requirements\nStatus technology development\nSchedule and cost\n\nImplementation Phase C\nFinal Design and\nFabrication\n\nDevelop final mission architecture\nDevelop final operational plan\nDevelop final system requirements\nComplete detailed design of system\nComplete detailed design of subsystems\nDemonstrate maturity of needed technologies\nPass critical design review\nFabricate, integrate, and test subsystems.\n\nMission objectives\nSystem-level requirements\nMission critical design\nMission architecture\nMission operational plan\nCritical subsystem requirements\nStatus of technology developments\nSchedule and cost\nTested subsystems\n\nPhase D\nSystem Assembly,\nIntegration and Test,\nLaunch\n\nIntegrate and test the system\nVerify it meets requirements\nValidate it meets needs\nLaunch\n\nVerified and validated system ready to be\ndeployed\nDeployed system\n\nPhase E\nOperations and\nSustainment\n\nInitiate the mission\nImplement mission operations plan\nSustain operations support\n\nOperational system\n\nPhase F\nCloseout\n\nDecommission system\nDispose of system\n\nDisposed system\n\n7 Space Systems Engineering 151\n\n\n\nbetween the functional blocks, where the flow of informa-\ntion between functions is shown by the direction of the\narrows. For any block, e.g., Fi, the column represents\nthe inputs from all other blocks and the row represents the\n\noutputs to all other blocks. If there is no interface between\ntwo functional blocks, the block that represents their\ninterface is blank. The n-square diagram assists in assuring\nthat all interfaces are appropriately assigned.\n\nFig. 7.7 NASA technology\ndevelopment life cycles, from\n[12]\n\nFig. 7.8 Example of a\nfunctional flow block diagram,\nfrom [4]\n\n152 V. L. Pisacane\n\n\n\nOnce the functional decompositions and functional\nanalyses are completed it is possible to begin the design\nsolution process. This involves transforming the system and\nsubsystem requirements into a realized system through the\nremaining life cycle procedures identified in Sect. 7.2.\n\nFigure 7.10 illustrates the flowdown of requirements to\nthe subsystem level. An allocated requirement (or simply\nrequirement) is one that is directly related to a higher level\nrequirement. Thus, an allocated requirement can be directly\ntraced back to a specific higher level requirement. In con-\ntrast, a derived requirement is a requirement that is not\nexplicitly related to a higher level requirement but is\nimposed independently to satisfy a higher level requirement.\nAlthough not explicitly indicated by the higher-level\nrequirement, it is inferred from the context of the higher\nlevel requirement. Derived requirements are generated dur-\ning the formulation phases and must be established to fully\nspecify the system. Consequently, derived requirements are\ntypically not part of the initial requirements documents.\nHowever, once the derived requirements are established it is\nnecessary to allocate them to the appropriate subsystems in\norder to fully specify the design requirements. An example\nof an allocated requirement is the mass allocated for a sub-\nsystem imposed to satisfy a top-level requirement on mass.\nAlternatively, voltages available from the power bus would\nnot be expected to be traceable to a higher-level requirement\nbut would be imposed as a derived requirement for other\nsubsystems.\n\nIt is important that the characteristic of each work\nproduct is traceable to each subsystem requirement, which\nis in turn traceable to specific system-level requirements,\nand that each system-level requirement is traceable to the\nuser needs. Bidirectional traceability of requirements will\nensure that each of the lowest level requirements is required\nto satisfy the user\u2019s needs. In addition, if it becomes nec-\nessary to change a requirement, each aspect affected can be\nappropriately identified. These relationships are often\nidentified in a bidirectional requirements traceability matrix\n(BRTM). The BRTM provides a convenient way to assu-\nredly locate and identify the impact of any proposed change\nto all affected entities. Backward traceability can verify that\nthe work product is consistent with the requirements and\nneeds. The BRTM is also useful in developing and carrying\nout test plans and assisting in verification and validation\n\nassessments. BRTMs can be developed using the procedure\ndescribed in Fig. 7.11, utilizing a variety of tools including\nrequirements management software, databases, spread-\nsheets, tables, or hyperlinks. In its simplest form, it consists\nof a spreadsheet with vertical columns of hierarchical\nnumbering system, requirements, and sources of the\nrequirement.\n\nEssential characteristics for requirements traceability to\nbe consistent and complete are\n\n\u2022 The requirements traceability matrix should identify all\nthe system-level requirements that include the technical\nrequirement and constraints.\n\n\u2022 The requirements traceability matrix should list all the\nlower-level requirements that include the technical\nrequirement and constraints.\n\n\u2022 The requirements identified should be identical to those\nidentified in other documents specifying requirements,\nspecifications, and constraints.\n\n\u2022 Each system-level requirement should be linked to at\nleast one lower-level requirement.\n\n\u2022 Each requirement at a lower-level element should be\nlinked to a system-level requirement.\n\n\u2022 If a requirement at a lower level is not linked to a\nrequirement at a higher level, this requirement should be\nseparately justified.\n\n7.4 Technical Assessment\n\nMonitoring throughout the project life cycle is essential to\nassure that the technical requirements are being achieved.\nTechnical assessment is generally done independent of\nassessing fiscal status. Technical assessment is generally\naccomplished by technical reviews at the subsystem, ele-\nment, segment, and system levels. These reviews provide\neffective mechanisms by which to communicate among\nparticipants and demonstrate that particular objectives or\nmilestones have or have not been achieved. In particular, a\nreview\n\n\u2022 Provides an independent technical assessment of status\n\u2022 Assures that interfaces are understood\n\u2022 Promotes communication among participants\n\u2022 Formalizes and documents that milestones have been\n\nachieved\n\u2022 Identifies outstanding issues\n\u2022 Provides affirmation to management of the status of the\n\nproject.\nTo assure a competent and complete review it is\n\nimportant that\n\u2022 A review panel is chartered to provide the assessment\n\u2022 The members of the panel have no conflict of interest and\n\nare knowledgeable of the technologies to be covered\n\nFig. 7.9 N-square diagram where Fi = Function i = 1 to n\n\n7 Space Systems Engineering 153\n\n\n\n\u2022 Specific purposes and objectives of the review are clearly\ndefined\n\n\u2022 Review is scheduled at a time when presenters are ready\nand have adequate time to prepare\n\n\u2022 A dry run of presentations is held\n\u2022 Agenda should allow sufficient time for each presentation\n\u2022 Material provided to panel and interested parties is clear,\n\nsuccinct, and consistent and sufficiently prior to the\nreview\n\n\u2022 Chairperson meets with project management and\nreviewers to confirm the purposes, objectives, and the\nprotocol\n\n\u2022 Chairperson controls meeting\n\u2022 Forms are available for members and audience to identify\n\nissues and questions\n\u2022 Tentative action items are identified and documented\n\nduring the meeting\n\n\u2022 Splinter meetings on specific topics may be directed by\nchairperson\n\n\u2022 Tentative action items, questions, and comments are\nintegrated by the review panel into a manageable number\nof formal action items\n\n\u2022 At the conclusion the action items are identified, dis-\ncussed, possibly amended and assigned to a particular\nindividual with a due date for completion\n\n\u2022 The review panel submits a definitive report.\nDevelopment of a system is not complete without rigor-\n\nous testing and assessments to assure that the implementa-\ntion is consistent with the requirements and intended use. A\nsystem-level test and evaluation plan should be initiated in\nPhase A, developed concurrently with the system-level\nrequirements, and assessments should be specifically linked\nto the requirements. The plan should then be iterated with\nincreasing specificity throughout the subsequent phases of\n\nFig. 7.10 Requirements\nflowdown, from [4]\n\n154 V. L. Pisacane\n\n\n\nthe project. As the system-level requirements are hierar-\nchically decomposed into segment, element, subsystem,\nassembly, and subassembly requirements, appropriate tests\nneed to be concurrently developed for each level to dem-\nonstrate that those requirements are satisfied. Thus, these\ntests assure compliance of the development with regard to\nrequirements specified for that level. It is critical that each\ntest plan be reviewed to assure that the test article will be at\nan appropriate stage to be tested, the test will demonstrate its\nrequired functionality and assess the requirements, the test\nfacility is appropriate with sufficient safeguards, the per-\nsonnel to carry out the test are qualified, the appropriate data\nare to be collected, and the test results will be fully docu-\nmented. These test results should be reported on in the\nsubsequent technical reviews. The types of reviews\nencountered in the development of a space system follow in\nFig. 7.12 and are time sequenced.\n\nThe reviews in Fig. 7.12 are\n\nCDR Critical Design Review: A multi-disciplinary\ntechnical review to assess whether the system is\nready to proceed into system fabrication, integra-\ntion, and test\n\nCERR Critical Events Readiness Review: Assesses the\nproject\u2019s readiness to execute a critical activity\n\nConR Continuation Review: Assesses the status of a\nproject to recommend for or against continuation\n\nDR Decommissioning Review: Assesses the readiness\nof the system to be safely decommissioned and\ndisposed\n\nFRR Flight Readiness Review: Assesses the readiness\nof the system and support activities to achieve a\nsuccessful launch and follow-on flight operations\n\nMCR Mission Concept Review: Assesses whether the\nmission concept will satisfy the overall require-\nments and needs\n\nMDR Mission Definition Review: Assesses whether the\nmission concept and architecture are technically\nfeasible and match available resources\n\nORR Operational Readiness Review: Assesses whether\nthe system characteristics, operational procedures\nand documentation, and capabilities of the oper-\nators and support systems can support a successful\noperation\n\nPDR Preliminary Design Review: A multi-disciplinary\ntechnical review that assesses whether or not the\nsystem design is sufficiently complete to conclude\nPhase B and proceed into Phase C\n\nPFAR Post-Flight Assessment Review: Assesses launch\nanomalies and issues and recommends actions to\nimprove future launches\n\nPLAR Post-Launch Assessment Review: Post-launch\nassessment of the readiness of the spacecraft\nsystems to proceed with normal operations\n\nPRR Production Readiness Review: Assesses the read-\niness to efficiently begin production by review of\nthe production plans\n\nPTR Periodic Technical Review: Assesses technical\nprogress and status\n\nSAR System Acceptance Review: Assesses the com-\npleteness of the deliverables by reviewing the\ndesign, documentation, and test results to assure\nthe requirements are satisfied\n\nSDR System Definition Review: Assesses the system\narchitecture and requirements flowdown\n\nSIR System Integration Review: Assesses whether the\nsystem, element, or subsystem is ready to be\nintegrated\n\nSRR System Requirements Review: Assesses the ade-\nquacy of the system functional and performance\nrequirements\n\nTRR Test Readiness Review: Assesses the readiness of\nthe test facility, capabilities of the support per-\nsonnel, and appropriateness of the test procedures\nto determine if a test can be safely carried out.\n\nVerification and validation, known as V&V; independent\nverification and validation known as IV&V; and verifica-\ntion, validation, and accreditation known as VV&A; are\n\nFig. 7.11 Bidirectional requirements traceability process\n\n7 Space Systems Engineering 155\n\n\n\nimportant processes to establish that the requirements have\nbeen met and that the system should meet the user\u2019s\nrequirements and needs. IV&V differs from V&V in that the\nIV&V evaluation is carried out by personnel independent of\nthe system development.\n\nVerification is the process that evaluates whether or not\nthe products of a life cycle phase satisfy the conditions\nimposed at the start of that phase. Verification can be\ncarried out throughout the development life cycle and is\n\nintended to identify deficiencies, redundancies, and\ndiscrepancies relative to the requirements. Activities\nundertaken include inspections of components and prod-\nucts, peer reviews, modeling, and testing. Testing is an\nactivity by which a system is activated under specified\nconditions and the results are observed and documented so\nthat an evaluation can be made. It is essential that the\ncapability to adequately test a system be designed into it\nduring the design phase.\n\nFig. 7.12 Systems engineering\ntechnical reviews, from [10]\n\n156 V. L. Pisacane\n\n\n\nValidation is the process that evaluates whether or not the\nsystem will serve its intended purpose. Consequently, it can\nonly be carried out at the completion of the development\nwhen the completed system is available to be evaluated.\nStrategies for validation include system-level testing, alpha\ntesting, and beta testing. Alpha testing is sometimes\nemployed after acceptance testing in order to further validate\nthe system. When utilized, it is generally carried out by the\ndevelopers to identify any residual technical issues and\nfurther validate the system\u2019s operational functionality. Beta\ntesting may be employed for systems when it is deemed\nimportant to further identify any technical or operational\nissues that may be encountered by the user after the systems\nhas been deployed in the operational environment. Thus, this\ntesting is generally performed by accommodating users.\nCompliance testing with respect to the project requirements\nwas discussed earlier. In addition, compliance testing with\nrespect to industry standards may be undertaken if the sys-\ntem is to interface with other systems. Standards compliance\ntests help to assure the interoperability of the system.\n\nV&V are particularly important for assuring the integrity\nof software-intensive systems, especially those with exten-\nsive embedded software. V&V plans are developed early as\npart of the systems engineering process and define the goals,\nobjectives, techniques, and documentation of the assess-\nments. Planning and execution of the programs are gener-\nally carried out by V&V engineers who are not involved in\ndeveloping the system. Thus, they are sufficiently inde-\npendent to appropriately plan and implement the V&V\nprograms.\n\nAccreditation is the confirmation by a convening\nauthority that the system will work as defined. This may be\nbased on the documentation of the V&V programs, but may\nalso be based on an independent assessment chartered by\nthe convening authority.\n\n7.5 Software Systems Engineering\n\nAs space systems become more complex, their subsystems\nhave correspondingly increased in complexity with more\nreliance on complex firmware and software components.\nSometimes the physical and logical boundaries between\nsoftware and hardware can be uncertain. In many cases, the\nsoftware is the most complex and challenging aspect of a\nsubsystem or system. To efficiently and effectively develop\nfirmware and software it is important to adopt a software\nsystems engineering process. This is described in detail in\nChap. 16 and is discussed here briefly because software is\nan ever-increasingly critical aspect of satisfying the\nrequirements within schedule and budget. Perceived as\n\u2018easy to change\u2019, software may provide flexibility to\n\novercome hardware deficiencies, especially late in the\ndevelopment cycle.\n\nSoftware systems engineering and systems engineering\nhave evolved essentially independently, but to successfully\ndevelop a system with important hardware and software\ncomponents it is necessary to integrate these processes. Not\nadopting a systems engineering approach to software\ndevelopment may result in software that does not satisfy its\nrequirements, does not integrate well with its hardware host\nor other elements of the system, is not easily changeable,\nand may be difficult to test, update, and document. Suffice it\nto say that software systems engineering follows a scenario\nsimilar to that described here for the system of which it is a\ncomponent.\n\nThe international standard ISO/IEC-12207:2008 [7]\ndescribes software life cycle processes that can be used to\nacquire or develop software products or the software com-\nponents of a system. The software engineering standard\nECSS-E-ST-40C [13] and the software product assurance\nstandard ECSS-Q-ST-80C [14] are both based on ISO/IEC-\n12207 [7]. NASA\u2019s software engineering requirements are\ndescribed in NPR 7150.2A [15]. For a detailed description\nof software system engineering processes the reader is\nreferred to Chap. 16.\n\n7.6 Configuration Management\n\nConfiguration management is the discipline that assures that\na system conforms to its requirements and that its docu-\nmentation sufficiently and accurately describes its func-\ntional and physical characteristics. The level of detail of the\ndocumentation should be sufficient to troubleshoot, repair,\nupdate, and replicate the system. A configuration manage-\nment plan should be initiated at the beginning of Phase C.\nConfiguration management control is generally instituted\nafter the design has been frozen, subsequent to the critical\ndesign review in Phase C. Configuration management\nconsists of five elements\n\u2022 Configuration planning and management\u2014Initiated by\n\nthe development of a strategic plan that specifies the total\nconfiguration management activity, fully communicates it\nto all participants, and assures that participants comply\nwith all provisions.\n\n\u2022 Configuration identification\u2014The structured process to\nidentify the items to be under configuration management, the\nrequired documentation, and the change control authority.\n\n\u2022 Configuration change management\u2014The procedure to be\nfollowed to propose, adjudicate, resolve, and approve\nchanges to the configuration. Figure 7.13 illustrates a\ntypical procedure for effecting orderly changes.\n\n7 Space Systems Engineering 157\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_16\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_16\n\n\n\u2022 Configuration status accounting\u2014Provides the status of\nthe configuration of each item, such as historical con-\nfiguration documentation and status of changes, waivers,\ndiscrepancies, and proposed changes. It provides the\nsingle authoritative source for baseline definitions.\n\n\u2022 Configuration verification\u2014Verifies that all changes have\nbeen incorporated, that the required documentation is\ncomplete and accurate, and that all requirements have\nbeen satisfied.\nFinally, redlining is the procedure of making changes to\n\ndocumentations, drawings and documents by clearly\nmarking up a controlled set of documentation instead of\nissuing new documentation. New documentation, especially\ndetailed drawings, requires time to be completed, verified\nfor accuracy, and approved. Redlining works well to reduce\nschedule delays in effecting changes but should not be used\nto circumvent verification and approval procedures.\n\n7.7 Systems Engineering Organization\n\nTechnology management is described in Chap. 21 and\noverall project management is described in Chap. 22. Here\nthe system engineering organization structure is succinctly\ndiscussed. The organization to assure effective systems\nengineering should be defined in the systems engineering\nmanagement plan. It should be tailored to the specific\nproject undertaken and communicated to all participants.\nFor the systems engineering function to be effective and\nefficient, the organizational structure should have the fol-\nlowing characteristics\n\u2022 Clearly defines roles, responsibilities, and controls\n\u2022 Delegates responsibility and commensurate control\n\u2022 Establishes streamlined reporting procedures\n\u2022 Facilitates bidirectional communications\n\u2022 Standardizes and simplifies reporting and documentation\n\nFig. 7.13 Typical configuration\nchange control procedure.

Risk is defined as the potential inability to achieve a\nparticular requirement and the potential for unexpected\nadverse outcomes. Risk management is the adoption of sys-\ntematic procedures to identify and reduce risks to an acceptable\nlevel. Early detection is important in order to reduce the pro-\ngrammatic impact of a potential risk. Risks to a system include\ncost, schedule, and technical. Cost and schedule risks relate to\nthe inability to satisfy the budget and meet the schedule.\nTechnical risks relate to not satisfying the technical require-\nments. More specifically, risks may include such factors as\ncriticality, national or international importance, reflight\nopportunities, financial investment, loss of life, and other rel-\nevant factors. A particular mission may include instruments or\nelements at different risk levels. However, no item should be\ndependent on another item that is at a higher risk level.\n\nA risk management program is a systematic phased\napproach to identify, analyze, plan, track, and control\npotential risks while documenting and communicating them\nto the relevant parties, as illustrated in Fig. 7.14. At any phase\nin the sequence, it may be necessary to return to an earlier\nphase if new information leads to the identification of a new\nrisk or changes a characteristic of a previously identified risk.\n\nRisk identification may be based on expert opinion,\nlessons learned from implementing similar systems, test\nresults, engineering analyses, or hazard analyses. The out-\nput from the identification phase includes the identification\nand description of each risk, its potential causes, priority,\nand consequences. Hazard analyses utilizes one of three\napproaches to identify potential failures\n\u2022 Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA)\u2014An inductive or\n\nbottom-up approach that assumes a failure or defect at the\nlowest level and assesses its effects. It is used most\nadvantageously early in the design process and should be\nreported on in design reviews to identify potential design\nweaknesses.\n\n\u2022 Failure Mode Effects Criticality Analysis (FMECA)\u2014\nAdds the probability of occurrence and the potential\nseverity of failure to the FMEA process.\n\n\u2022 Fault Tree Analyses (FTA)\u2014A deductive top-down\napproach that identifies a potential failure and then\nidentifies all events that could give rise to the failure.\n\nThe analysis phase consists of evaluating the risks and\ntheir consequences, severities, probabilities of occurrence,\ntimeframe of occurrence, contributing factors, and relative\ncriticality. Several approaches can be used to prioritize\nrisks. The most common is to decompose the risk into two\ncomponents: the probability of occurrence and the potential\nconsequences if it should occur, as illustrated in Fig. 7.15.\nThe measures for each may be quantized as low, medium,\nor high, or as continuous, as from 0 to 100 or 0 to 10. Low\nimpact and low probability of occurrence risks in the lower\nleft hand corner have the lowest priority and are often\naccepted. High impact and high probability of occurrence\nrisks in the upper right corner are of critical importance,\nhave the highest priorities, and receive the most attention.\nLow impact and high probability of occurrence risks in the\nupper left corner and high impact low probability of\noccurrence risks in the lower right corner are of moderate to\nhigh importance and should be addressed as appropriate,\ndepending on the impact and cost to mitigate. A specific\ninstantiation of this approach often used in NASA projects\nis illustrated in Table 7.6 where the numbers from 1 to 7\nindicate a relative prioritization with number 1 having the\nhighest priority. Outputs of the analysis phase include the\ndetailed assessment, classification of risks by type, priori-\ntization by severity, and potential mitigating actions.\n\nRisk planning relates to the development of a formal risk\nmanagement plan to address each risk based on the appro-\npriate analyses. Each plan includes provisional decisions on\nrisk control, identification of observables and their thresh-\nolds, methodologies for documenting observables, proposed\nactions when observables exceed their thresholds, and\nassignment of responsibility for tracking risks. Observables\nare measurable parameters that provide information on the\nseverity and probability of the risk. Possible decisions on\nrisk control include: eliminate, mitigate, research, watch, or\naccept. The outputs of the planning phase are risk man-\nagement plans for each risk that describe the procedures to\nbe followed for mitigation.\n\nRisk tracking is the procedure that monitors the status of\nthe risks and action taken. The observables for each risk are\ntracked and reported on as identified in the risk management\nplan. If an observable exceeds a threshold; e.g., if an\ninsignificant risk evolves into a significant risk or a new risk\nis identified, management is notified and appropriate action\ntaken. Outputs of the tracking phase are reports on the status\nof the severity of the risk, probability of occurrence, and the\nmitigations undertaken.\n\nRisk control is exercised to ensure that the risk manage-\nment plan is appropriate, is being carried out, deviations are\nassessed and adjudicated, and up-to-date assessment of the\noverall risk and the status of each risk are provided to man-\nagement. The outputs of the control phase are the\n\n7 Space Systems Engineering 159\n\n\n\nidentification of each risk by category, status of the risk\nmitigation activities, and the overall assessment of risk for\nthe mission.\n\nHaving an a priori classification of acceptable risks\nprovides a structured methodology that can be used as\nguidance to carry out risk management. Table 7.7 illustrates\nfour classifications of risks used by NASA for payloads,\nsubsystems, elements, or systems. Recognizing a priori the\nrelative risk that is acceptable can help provide a more\nuniform approach to the risk mitigation.\n\nThe institution of fault protection that includes building\ninto the system the capability to detect faults and institute\nresponses can reduce the risk to space missions. While this\nfunction can be established cooperatively in the spacecraft\nand ground segments, it is usually instituted autonomously\nin each segment separately that places the segment in one of\nseveral planned safe modes. When this occurs, human\nintervention from either the spacecraft or ground segment\n(or both) can assess the situation and take corrective action.\nHowever, for critical events or the need for operational\ncontinuity, it may be necessary for the each segment to\nautonomously take corrective action by transitioning to\nback-up subsystems or an alternate mode of operation.\n\n7.9 Cost and Schedule\n\nCost and schedule are intrinsically linked to the engineering\ndevelopment by direct association with the activities that\nneed to be carried out. An important tool in defining the\nwork to be done is the work breakdown structure (WBS).\nThis is the decomposition of the work to be done into dis-\ntinct activities, starting at the system level and decomposing\nthe activities hierarchically to the segment, element,\n\nsubsystem, assembly, and subassembly levels as appropri-\nate. Each activity should have identifiable criteria to start\nthe activity and measureable outputs at completion. Defined\nfor each activity are: dependent and precursor activities;\ndeliverables with final and intermediate milestones, together\nwith their completion dates; required resources in person-\nnel, purchases, subcontracts, and facilities; and unique\nissues such as specialized training needs and significant\ncontracts. As a result of defining the activities in this\nmanner, a schedule and budget can be determined at each\nlevel. This is generally accomplished with considerable\nfeedback among levels in order to assure consistency. The\nactivities at each level can be represented into a schedule by\nBar or Gantt charts, milestone charts, or network diagrams.\nIn defining the schedule at each level, attention must be\ndirected to the critical paths and floats for each activity.\nFree float is the time that an activity can be delayed without\naffecting other activities. Path float is the time along a path\nin the schedule that activities can collectively be delayed\nwithout affecting the final delivery date. The critical path\n(or paths) are paths that have zero or near-zero path float.\nWith specification of costs associated with each activity at\neach level, budgets allocations can be determined at each\nlevel of the work breakdown structure.\n\nDesign to cost is an important concept that is of\nincreasing interest as budgets are receiving increased scru-\ntiny where non-fixed cost contracts have historically been\nthe norm. Previously, performance, schedule, and cost were\nprioritized in that order, with cost often an afterthought to\nthe technical staff. The design engineer was often inde-\npendent of the budgeting process and the monitoring of cost\nduring the execution of the project. This is no longer the\ncase as the design engineer is now typically equally\naccountable for performance, schedule, and cost. To make\n\nFig. 7.14 Technical risk\nmanagement procedures\n\n160 V. L. Pisacane\n\n\n\nthis effective it is important that costs be allocated at the\nlowest reasonable WBS level and that expenditures be\ntracked at the same WBS level.\n\nEarned value management is a methodology to more\naccurately assess the status of the schedule and cost of a\nproject. When an assessment is to be made three costs are\ndetermined: budgeted cost of work scheduled, budgeted\ncost of work performed, and actual cost of work performed.\nThe budgeted cost of work scheduled (BCWS) or planned\nvalue is the sum of the budgeted cost of the activities that\nshould have been completed at the time of the assessment.\nThe budgeted cost of work performed (BCWP) is the\nbudgeted cost of the activities that are actually completed.\nTwo rules are often applied for activities that have been\nstarted but are incomplete. The first approach for the BCWS\nand BCWP is to use a percentage of the budget based on the\npercentage of the work scheduled and performed. The\nsecond approach is to use 50 % of the budgeted costs for\neach until the activity is completed. The actual cost of work\nperformed (ACWP) is the actual cost incurred and is gen-\nerally determined from the allocation of costs to specific\nactivities, as on time cards or cost accumulation system.\nThis necessitates having a system in place to faithfully\ncapture costs by activities to the required level. The total\nbudget is the budget at completion (BAC) and the schedule\n\nlength is the schedule at completion (SAC). From these\nquantities the following estimates can be made at any time\nin the schedule\n\u2022 The cost variance (CV) is given by the difference\n\nbetween BCWP and the ACWP, with a positive sign\nindicating that the project is under budget and a negative\nsign the project is over budget.\n\nCV \u00bc BCWP? ACWP \u00f07:1\u00de\n\n\u2022 The schedule variance (SV) is given by the difference\nbetween BCWP and BCWS, with a positive sign indi-\ncating that the project is ahead of schedule and a negative\nsign the project is behind schedule.\n\nSV \u00bc BCWP? BCWS \u00f07:2\u00de\n\n\u2022 The percent complete (PC) is the fraction of the work\ncompleted and is given by the BCWP divided by the\nBAC.\n\nPC \u00bc BCWP\nBAC\n\n\u00f07:3\u00de\n\n\u2022 The cost performance index (CPI) represents the cost\nefficiency and is given by the BCWP divided by the\nACWP where favorable is [1 and unfavorable is \\1.\n\nCPI \u00bc BCWP\nACWP\n\n\u00f07:4\u00de\n\n\u2022 The schedule performance index (SPI) is a measure of\nhow far the project is ahead (SPI [ 1) or behind schedule\n(SPI \\ 1) and is given by the BCWP divided by the\nBCWS.\n\nSPI \u00bc BCWP\nBCWS\n\n\u00f07:5\u00de\n\n\u2022 The estimate at completion (EAC) is given by the ACWP\nplus the difference between the BAC and the BCWP\nwhere the difference is divided by the CPI. In each case it\nis assumed that the cost efficiency will continue.\n\nEAC \u00bc ACWP\u00fe BAC ?

An\nanalogous or analog estimate is based on the cost data from\nsimilar projects in which the differences due to inflation and\ntechnical differences can be estimated. The precision of this\napproach depends on the accuracy and detail with which the\ncosts were tabulated, the accuracy with which the technical\ndetails are known, and the ability to extrapolate differences\n\nof the new undertaking. The engineering build-up or bot-\ntom-up estimate is based on estimates from the lead engi-\nneers for each subsystem. This works well if the lead\nengineers have considerable experience with the products to\nbe developed, but there is a tendency to include a margin at\neach level of management. This is the most costly and time\nconsuming of the three methods, but generally the most\naccurate if the excess margins can be identified and nego-\ntiated. The parametric estimate is a top down process and\nuses computational models of similar developments to\nestimate the costs. These models use relationships between\ntechnical and program characteristics and costs based on\nprior developments. This approach depends on character-\nizing the product in terms of the model parameters and the\nsimilarity of the model developmental inputs to the current\nproduct. This can be a quick and less costly approach if the\nappropriate models are available.\n\nTable 7.7 NASA a priori risk classifications, from [18]\n\nCharacterization Class A Class B Class C Class D\n\nPriority\n(Criticality to\nagency strategic\nplan) and\nacceptable risk\nlevel\n\nHigh priority, Very low\n(minimized) risk\n\nHigh priority, low risk Medium priority, medium\nrisk\n\nLow priority, high risk\n\nNational\nsignificance\n\nVery high High Medium Low to medium\n\nComplexity Very high to high High to medium Medium to low Medium to low\n\nMission lifetime\n(Primary\nBaseline\nMission)\n\nLong, [5 years Medium, 2\u20135 years Short, \\2 years Short, \\2 years\n\nCost High High to medium Medium to low Low\n\nLaunch\nconstraints\n\nCritical Medium Few Few to none\n\nIn-flight\nmaintenance\n\nN/A Not feasible or difficult Maybe feasible Maybe feasible and planned\n\nAlternative\nresearch\nopportunities or\nre-flight\nOpportunities\n\nNo Alternative or re-flight\nopportunities\n\nFew or no alternative or re-\nflight opportunities\n\nSome or few alternative or\nre-flight opportunities\n\nSignificant alternative or re-\nflight opportunities\n\nAchievement of\nmission success\ncriteria\n\nAll practical ara taken to\nachieve minimum risk to\nmission success.

Systems engineering is\nespecially useful when there is no single obvious correct\nsolution to satisfy the need, when the project is technically\ncomplex, or the management is distributed.

Obersteiner\nand Oskar Haidn\n\nAccess to space requires the delivery of, typically, between\n34 MJ/kg (low Earth orbit, LEO) and 58 MJ/kg (geosta-\ntionary orbit, GEO) which, when considering the mass of our\nheaviest satellites, is a significant challenge. By comparison,\na car driving 180 km/h has only the energy equivalent to\n0.004 % (1,250 J/kg) of that required to access space.\n\nTo access space, a dedicated tool is required: a launcher\nor launch vehicle. Often also called a rocket, by assimilation\nof its propulsion principle, or a booster, as you need to boost\nyour payload in order to have it gain the proper energy, but\nthe most frequently used term is the word launcher: the\nmachine that launches something into orbit.\n\nThe design of a launcher follows a succession of intricate\nactivities known as the \u2018system design loop\u2019. A simplified\nexample of such a loop is given in Fig. 8.1. These activities\nbegin with the selection of the mission to be performed, and\nthe associated constraints; for instance, the main mission of\na new launcher may be the injection of a 4-ton satellite into\na Sun-synchronous orbit at 800 km altitude, the associated\nconstraints being the dimensions of the payload, its\nacceptable dynamic environment, and so on. This dictates\nthe performance to be achieved by the launch vehicle.\n\nThe first technical activity of the system design loop is the\nchoice of the number of propulsive stages, and their general\n\ncharacteristics; size, diameter, type of propellants, and so on.\nFrom this can be deduced more precise propulsive charac-\nteristics, such as the engine cycle, the level of thrust, the size\nof the nozzles, and the general aerodynamic characteristics of\nthe launcher; its drag, lift and moment coefficients through-\nout the complete flight regime in the atmosphere. Thereafter,\nthe first trajectories can be computed, giving precious\ndimensioning data, mainly acceleration profile versus flight\ntime, as well as dynamic pressure, enabling a first assessment\nof the induced environment.\n\nGeneration of the first trajectories enables assessment of\nthe controllability of the launcher. This, in turn, gives the\ninputs for the engine tilting or fin steering, which leads to\nthe determination of the general loads applied to the various\nparts of the launcher, the stresses induced to the structures\nby the inertia loads, and the dynamic pressure effects when\nthe vehicle flies with a non-null angle of attack. This\ninduced environment then facilitates the first general\nstructural dimensioning of the launcher, i.e. selection of the\nmaterial and thicknesses of each of the structural parts of\nthe launcher. The controllability must be reassessed once\nthe dynamical behavior of the launcher is known, as this has\na strong influence on the control laws. Finally, a first mass\nbreakdown of the launcher can be established, and a more\neffective performance estimate determined before once\nagain starting the system design loop.\n\nThe system design loops are important, as there is no way\nto dimension a launcher without going (as the minimum)\nthrough all these steps. Furthermore, it is important to\nunderstand how deeply intricate these activities can be: if, for\ninstance, an engine thrust is changed, then all the other design\nactivities will be impacted, trajectories, accelerations, induced\nenvironment, control, mass, and so on. Tools such as Con-\ncurrent Design Facilities enable the complete design loop to\nbe performed in near-real time, and allow rapid design trades.\n\nThe following paragraphs describe in a summarized\nmanner the steps required to define and dimension a\n\nM.

The\ntarget \u2018state\u2019 can be defined in many ways, as discussed in\nChap. 4, using different but equivalent forms that are called\neither a \u2018state vector\u2019, when comprised solely of scalar\nmagnitude terms, usually three position and three velocity\ncomponents. Alternatively, an \u2018element set\u2019, when com-\nprised of a set of geometric parameters, usually a mix of\nscalar magnitudes and angular representations. The techni-\ncal criteria associated with this main function are the range\nof achievable orbits and payloads, and the quality of the\nfinal orbit, determined in terms of the velocity change that is\nneeded to reach the final orbit. The target orbit state can be\nany of the orbit classifications discussed in Sect. 4.4, or\nbeyond into interplanetary space.\n\nThe secondary functions are associated with the handling\nof the payload: the launcher must cope with its volume and\nmechanical interfaces, it must be protected from natural and\ninduced environment, on-ground and in-flight, and it must\nbe capable of data exchanges with the ground to enable its\npre-launch operations and in-flight monitoring. The same is\nrequired for the launcher stages: environment control, data\nhandling, power, air-conditioning, and so on.\n\nThree sets of constraints can be identified. Product\nassurance requirements are the conditions to success\n\n\u2022 Reliability corresponds to the contract with the payload,\nas it is the probability to achieve the required orbit.\n\n\u2022 Availability is the probability to effectively launch when\ndesired; it integrates notions such as mean time between\nfailures (MTBF), and has a strong impact on the redun-\ndancy philosophy of the launcher layout, mainly regard-\ning its electrical equipment.\n\n\u2022 Maintainability is the probability to restore a flight status\nonce an anomaly is detected; it integrates the notion of\nmean time to repair (MTTR), and leads to stringent\nconstraints on the layout of the launcher and the acces-\nsibility of its most critical equipment.\n\n\u2022 Safety requirements express the risk to populations by\nlaunch operations. It covers the launch site safety,\nincluding the integration operations, as well as the far\nrange safety, which includes both nominal fall-out of the\nspent stages as well as the effects of anomalous events\nduring flight (e.g. explosion or loss of propulsion or\nguidance).\n\nDevelopment constraints express the frame in which the\ndevelopment is carried out and cover constraints such as, in\nEurope specifically, an activities geographical return or\njuste retour, at country, region or industrial level. It also\nincludes the programmatic constraints, such as the total\ndevelopment cost envelope and the time frame for the first\nflight. In some cases, the development constraints include\nsome imposed solutions, such as when a given existing\nengine is to be considered for one of the stages, and also the\ngrowth potential requirements.\n\nProduction constraints are expressed by the operator: they\ncan take the form of the launch frequency, the maximum\nmission cost, and the exchangeability between payloads.\n\nStructural Dimensioning\nMass\n\nInduced Environment\n\nAerodynamics\n\nGeneral Loads\n\nStaging\n\nPropulsion\n\nTrajectories\n\nPerformance\n\nControl\n\nLauncher Dynamics\n\nMissions\n\nConstrained\nfunctions\n\nFig. 8.1 Simplified system\ndesign loop\n\n166 C.

The\nprincipal applied force is the thrust generated. The thrust, or\npropulsive force FP (N), is due to the ejection of gases in the\ndirection opposite to the motion, with a mass flow _m (kg/s)\nand a velocity ve (m/s). During the atmospheric phase, pro-\npulsive losses are associated to the area of the engine nozzle\nAe (m\n\n2) on which the atmospheric pressure Pa (Pa) acts in the\nopposite direction to the thrust. That is\n\nFP \u00bc q ? ve ? Ae ? Pa: \u00f08:1\u00de\n\nAs introduced in Sect. 4.5.3, and will be discussed fur-\nther in Chap. 11, the notion of specific impulse, Isp, is used\nto characterize the efficiency of an engine, with the relation\n\nve \u00bc g ? Isp \u00f08:2\u00de\n\nwith g standard acceleration due to gravity at sea-level,\ng = 9.81 m/s2. Note that this equation is the same as\nEq. 11.3 and related to Eq. 4.146. Recall that the Isp is\nexpressed in seconds. The classic thrust expression derived\nfrom Eqs. 8.1 and 8.2 therefore becomes\n\nFP \u00bc _m ? g ? Isp ? Ae ? Pa: \u00f08:3\u00de\n\nThe direction of the propulsive force follows the axis of\nthe nozzle and is applied at the level of the pivot point of the\nengine (if any). In the case of multiple chambers or nozzles,\nthe propulsive force direction is determined by a combi-\nnation of the n vectors (direction, intensity).\n\nThe second main force acting on a launcher is the\naerodynamic force, which depends on the dynamic pressure\nthat is generated by the relative velocity of the launcher\nwith respect to the ambient atmosphere. That is\n\nPd \u00bc\n1\n2\n? q ? V2R \u00f08:4\u00de\n\nwith Pd (N), q (kg/m\n3) and VR (m/s). The aerodynamic\n\nforce is applied to the point called center of lift, which is\nwhere the integral of the elementary forces applied on the\nexternal surface of the launcher can be simplified into a\nperfect torque. As on an airplane, the aerodynamic force can\nbe subdivided into a drag, or axial force, RA, along the axis of\nthe launcher and opposed to its movement, and a lift, or\nnormal force, RN, perpendicular to the launcher axis; see also\nFig. 8.6. Other references are often used, defining drag and\nlift in the velocity frame instead of the launcher frame. The\nexpressions of the drag RA (N) and lift RN (N) are given in Eq.\n4.105 and again herein in a slightly different notation as\n\nRA \u00bc Pd ? Sref ? CA \u00bc\n1\n2\n? q ? v2R ? Sref ? CA \u00f08:5\u00de\n\nand\n\nRN \u00bc Pd ? Sref ? CN \u00bc\n1\n2\n? q ? v2R ? Sref ? CN \u00f08:6\u00de\n\nwhere CA and CN are respectively the drag and lift coefficients,\nand Sref (m\n\n2), called the reference surface, is a normalization\ncoefficient associated to the definition of the aerodynamic\ncoefficients.\n\nThe third force acting on the launcher is its weight,\napplied at the center of gravity of the launcher, which varies\nwith time as propellant is used. Finally, the wind is gener-\nally considered as a horizontal disturbance that modifies the\nrelative velocity of the launcher and its incidence. The\nforces acting on a launcher are summarized in Fig. 8.2.\n\n8.2.2 Equation of Dynamics\n\nThe forces defined on a launcher can be used to determine\nthe trajectory and the stability of the launcher. The\ndescription given here is slightly simplified, considering\nmovement in the vertical-horizontal plane, and force\napplication points on the axis of the launcher, which gen-\nerally is not the case.\n\nTaking the X-axis as the main axis of the launcher and\nthe Y-axis perpendicular in the vertical-horizontal plane, the\nprojection of the forces defined in the previous section on\nthe X and Y axes are\n\nFP ? cos b\u00f0 \u00de ? m ? g ? sin h\u00f0 \u00de ? RA \u00bc m ? CX \u00f08:7\u00de\n\nand\n\nFP ? sin b\u00f0 \u00de ? m ? g ? cos h\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe RN \u00bc m ? CY \u00f08:8\u00de\n\nwhere CX and CY (m/s\n2) are the components of the accel-\n\neration of the launcher along the X- and Y-axes. Their time\nintegral once, or twice, leads to the determination of the\nvelocity profile, and of the trajectory of the launcher versus\ntime. The evolution of this approach to three-dimensional\ntrajectories with an out-of-plane component is straightfor-\nward, introducing the third dimension Z in the equations\ntogether with one additional attitude angle.\n\n8.2.3 Stage Calculation, Basic Equations\nof Staging\n\nWhen considering the equations of dynamics defined in\nEq. 8.7 for the ideal case with no thrust deflection, no\naerodynamics forces, and no angle of attack, the propulsive\n\n8 Launch Systems 167\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nacceleration CP can simply be expressed as the ratio\nbetween the propulsive force FP and the mass M of the\nlauncher; these parameters are all time dependent.\n\nIf a given launcher stage functions in the time interval\ndefined between i (initial) and f (final), the velocity increase\ngenerated by the propulsion during this interval can be\nwritten as\n\nDVP \u00bc\nZf\n\ni\n\nCP ? dt \u00bc\nZf\n\ni\n\nFP\nm\n? dt \u00bc\n\nZf\n\ni\n\n_m ? g ?

Equation 8.12 is considered the fundamental\nequation of astronautics and was previously introduced in\nEq. 4.146; it is known as the Tsiolkovsky, or ideal rocket\nequation because it was Tsiolkovsky who derived the\nmodern form of the equation in 1903. However, as\n\ndiscussed in Chap. 1 perhaps the earliest example of this\nkind of equation dates as far back as 1,813.\n\nIt is noted that the rocket equation represents the ideal\ncase, with only one propulsive force acting along the axis of\nthe launcher. In reality, a number of losses associated with\nthe other forces acting on the launcher must be considered,\nin particular when the propulsive force is not applied along\nthe proper direction, or when the angle of attack or inci-\ndence is not null.

The lift losses\nare always weak or null, thrust orientation and drag losses\nare important mainly for the first stage. To obtain an order\nof magnitude of these losses, take as an example the Ariane\n5 ECA launcher in a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO)\nmission as detailed in Table 8.1. The losses can represent\n10\u201325 % of the propulsive DV (or even more), so for an\nearly design of a new launch vehicle, the order of magni-\ntude of the losses must be considered.\n\ni\n\nT\n\n?\n\nF\n\n?\n\nY-axis of launcher Local\nvertical\n\nLocal horizontal\n\nW\n\nG\n\n?\n\n: Propulsion\ng : gravity\nW : wind\n\n: drag\n: lift\n\n:relative velocity\nF : centre of lift\nT : nozzle pivot point\nG : centre of gravity, CofG\n\n: distance F to CofG\n: distance nozzle to CofG\n\n? : local slope\n? : deflection\n? : local attitude\ni : incidence\n\nFig. 8.2 Forces acting on a\nlauncher\n\n168 C. Bonnal et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_1\n\n\nThe mission DV is defined by the DV increase that is\nrequired for a given mission, the available propulsive DVP,\nand the losses, i.e.\n\nVf ? Vi \u00bc DVP ? losses: \u00f08:15\u00de\n\nThe final velocity, Vf, is also called the mission charac-\nteristic velocity and depends on the mission that is to be\nperformed. Typical values are 7,500 m/s (LEO), 10,000 m/s\n(GTO) or more than 11,200 m/s (escape missions).\n\nThe initial velocity depends on the location of the launch\npad and on the launch azimuth. That is\n\nVi \u00bc XRE cos\u00f0latitude\u00de sin\u00f0azimuth\u00de \u00f08:16\u00de\n\nwhere X represents the Earth\u2019s rotation rate and RE the\nEarth\u2019s radius. When launching towards the geostationary\norbit, using launch pads with low latitudes provides a\nbenefit from the Earth\u2019s rotation induced velocity.\nLaunching from the Sea Launch Odyssey platform, located\nat 0? latitude in the middle of the Pacific, gives an initial\nvelocity of 464 m/s, while launching from the Guiana Space\nCenter located at 5.2? is almost equivalent, with a gain of\n463 m/s. Meanwhile, launching from Cape Canaveral\nlocated at 28.5? leads to a gain of 408 m/s, whereas\nlaunching from Baikonur, with a latitude of 45.6? but a\nlaunch azimuth constrained by the presence of China to a\nfinal inclination of 51.6?, leads to a gain limited to 288 m/s.\nAiming at polar orbits, Sun-synchronous orbits, or highly\ninclined orbits change this initial velocity, reversing the\nsensitivity to latitude.\n\nThe initial velocity may also benefit from assistance at\nlaunch, for instance considering an air-launch, the launcher\nbenefiting from an airplane as an initial stage. This is the\ncase for instance with the Pegasus launcher, carried under a\nL1011 Tristar, benefiting from more than 200 m/s initial\nvelocity. In the case of a launch below a balloon, the initial\nvelocity is not changed, but the gravity losses are reduced\nby virtue of the release altitude.\n\n8.2.4 Number of Stages\n\nThe ideal rocket equation, Eq. 8.12, can be generalized to\nmulti-stage launchers. The case of a single stage launcher is\neasy to express, considering a dry mass, mD, a propellant\nmass, mP, a payload mass, mPL and an average specific\nimpulse Isp, the available propulsive DVP can be determined\nas\n\nDVP \u00bc g ? Isp ? Ln\nmD \u00fe mP \u00fe mPL\n\nmD \u00fe mPL\n\nffi ?\n: \u00f08:17\u00de\n\nConsidering the extreme case where no payload is laun-\nched, mPL = 0, and introducing k \u00bc mDmP , the structural ratio, the\nmaximal available DVP can be determined from Eq. 8.17 as\n\nDVP \u00bc g ? Isp ? Ln\n1\u00fe k\n\nk\n: \u00f08:18\u00de\n\nThis equation enables the theoretical analysis of a single-\nstage to orbit (SSTO) vehicle. Figure 8.3 shows the evolutions\nof DVP as a function of the average specific impulse along the\ntrajectory, and the structural ratio for such a SSTO. The figure\nshows that the assumptions required to reach orbit, with no\npayload, for a SSTO rocket propelled launcher are not realistic\nbecause even for an optimistic average specific impulse of\n400 s it would require a structural ratio of 12 % to reach the\nlowest altitude Earth orbit. Comparably, considering a realistic\noverall structural ratio of 20 %, it would require an average\nspecific impulse in the range of 500 s (average specific impulse\nmeans here the average along the complete trajectory, i.e.\nincluding all the atmospheric losses). It is not credible today to\nconsider a rocket propelled SSTO launcher, however, propul-\nsion based on air-breathing cycles can be much more efficient\nand could possible enable such a vehicle. Launchers are\ntherefore, composed of several stages, practically two to four.\n\nThe calculation of a multi-stage launcher is easy, directly\nderived from the ideal rocket equation, considering one\nstage after the other, starting from the upper one, with each\nstage having a dry mass MD equal to the sum of the dry\nmass of that stage added to the total mass of the stages\nabove it, including payload and fairing.\n\n8.2.5 Ballistic Phases\n\nDepending on the mission definition, ballistic phases may\nhave to be introduced to the launch profile. This is partic-\nularly the case when the launch pad latitude is high,\nrestricting access to low inclination orbits, or when the final\naltitude is too high to be achieved by a single propelled\nphase, or simply to optimize the performance. During these\nballistic phases, a number of perturbing forces may act on\nthe vehicle, mainly those due to the residual atmosphere as\ndiscussed in Sect. 4.3.3, and must be taken into account.\nTypical examples are GTO launches from Cape Canaveral\nor Baikonur, or missions aiming at medium Earth orbit\naltitudes.\n\nTable 8.1 Typical losses acting on an Ariane 5 ECA GTO mission (CNES)\n\nLosses Incidence and deflection (m/s) Drag (m/s) Lift Gravity (m/s)\n\nOrder of magnitude A5EC GTO 710 160 Weak or null 1,260\n\n8 Launch Systems 169\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\n8.3 Launch Trajectory\n\nThe trajectory of a launcher is defined as the evolution over\ntime of the position of its center of gravity. It can be defined\nwith respect to a large number of different reference points,\nsuch as the launch pad, or a Keplerian reference frame in\nabsolute Earth coordinates at the time of launch, leading to\ndifferent sets of equations. Changing reference frame\nchanges the equations of motion, but does not change the\nbasic principles of computation.\n\n8.3.1 Trajectory Design Constraints\n\nIntegrating Eqs. 8.7 and 8.8 is not very difficult per se, the\ndifficulty resides in the fulfillment of all the constraints that\nmust be applied.\n\nLauncher acceleration: the maximum axial acceleration\nof a launcher is usually constrained by its payload. Typical\nmaximal values are in the range of 45 m/s2 for an auto-\nmated payload, or 35 m/s2 when the launcher is crewed.\nThis constraint directly impacts the propulsion definition,\nand is also linked to the relative velocity through the drag\nterm: i.e. for a given propulsion level, it is better to aim\nvertically in order to decrease the relative velocity.\n\nMaximum dynamic pressure: the dynamic pressure is\nused to dimension the structures of the launcher, stages,\ninter-stages structures, and fairing. Both the dynamic pres-\nsure and its product with the angle of attack lead to stresses\non the structures and on the control requirements. The worst\npart of the flight is the so-called \u2018maximum dynamic pres-\nsure\u2019, which usually occurs close to 70 s into the flight. This\nimposes a constraint to not fly too low for a given velocity.\n\nMaximal thermal constraint: the structures are dimen-\nsioned by the thermal fluxes they encounter during the\natmospheric phase, which are proportional to the cube of the\n\nrelative velocity (depending on the flight phase, it may vary\nas V3:15R ). This imposes a constraint to not fly too low for a\ngiven relative velocity as the atmospheric density decreases\nrapidly with altitude.\n\nPitch-over: a launcher usually starts vertically on its\nlaunch pad (it may be slightly tilted for smaller launchers);\nhowever, at the injection into orbit, the velocity vector is\nusually more or less along the local horizontal. This means\nthe velocity vector must be progressively tilted from vertical\nto horizontal. This pitch-over maneuver is usually triggered\nshortly after the launch, typically after some 10 s of flight,\nand the launcher then follows a naturally curved trajectory\ncalled a gravity turn, defined by a zero angle of attack, at least\nuntil it gets out of the atmosphere.\n\nThe trajectory must also pass through some gaps between\nvisibility regions from the ground stations; consequently the\ntrajectory is constrained to impose a higher altitude than\noptimal in some of the regions, depending on the overlap time.\n\nSafety constraints are typically very stringent and can\nstrongly influence the trajectory. The first safety constraint is\nthe near-field constraint. All around the launch pad up to\ndistances of tens of kilometers, there will be installations or\neven cities that have to be protected during a launch. As a\ngeneral assumption, consider that the launcher may explode\nat any instant of its trajectory, spreading dangerous debris or\npollution over a wide area. The size of this area depends on\nthe altitude and the velocity vector at the instant of explosion,\ntogether with the explosion model (which itself is a function\nof the type of propulsion and the quantity of propellant\ninvolved). To that extent, two limits are defined, one on the\nvertical, and the other as a zone on the horizontal plane\nmatching the ground track. This leads to constraints on the\nrate of the pitch-over and on the launch azimuth, taking into\naccount the wind.\n\nThe second safety constraint is the long-range safety,\naddressing dropped stages or debris in both nominal and\nabnormal cases. This constraint is usually expressed in the\nlegal framework associated with the operations of the\nlaunch system. The nominal descent of used stages must\ntake place away from any landmass or islands with a given\nprobability. For instance, this can require that the debris\nzone shall be in international waters with a probability\nbetter than 1 9 10-4. In the case of an abnormal event\noccurring during the ascent, such as loss of propulsion or an\nexplosion, it is impossible to guarantee that debris will not\nfall on land, or even on inhabited zones; the constraint is\nthen expressed as the minimization of the casualty risk\nassociated with the launch, which must be below a specified\nthreshold. This risk is computed as the time integral over\nthe mission of the product of the probability of losing\npropulsion or exploding, multiplied by the conditional\nprobability of generating casualties at that location.\n\nStructural Ratio, k\n\n0.05 0.15 0.250.10 0.20\n\nP\nro\n\np\nu\n\nls\niv\n\ne \n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n8000\n\n9000\n\n10000\n\n11000\n\n12000\n\nPropulsive for LEO\n\nPropulsive for GTO\n\n= 450 s\n\n= 400 s\n\n= 350 s\n\n= 300 s\n\nFig. 8.3 Propulsive DVP for a SSTO launcher\n\n170 C. Bonnal et al.\n\n\n\nThese constraints are often difficult to integrate correctly,\nas some of them may be antagonist. For instance, it may be\nbest to launch as vertical as possible in order to lower\nacceleration and dynamic pressure, but as horizontal as\npossible at the same time to appease the near-field safety\nconstraint.\n\nFigure 8.4 illustrates the effect of some of the trajectory\nconstraints mentioned for the case of an Ariane 5 GTO\nmission. It presents the nominal trajectory in red, in the plane\nof velocity (m/s) versus altitude (m) for the first phases of the\nmission. A compromise between structural dimensioning\n(dynamic pressure and heat flux) and safety constraints\n(verticality limits) makes the flight corridor tight.\n\n8.3.2 Trajectory Optimization\n\nTrajectory optimization is similar to any mathematical\noptimization and follows the same expression: a state vector\nis defined, composed of the vector position and velocity of\nthe launcher center of gravity, of its mass, and of the set of\nparameters on which the optimization can be performed,\nincluding payload mass and combustion time. The state\nvector is sought to describe the thrust magnitude and\ndirection, expressed as two angles.\n\nIntermediate constraints can be defined, such as maxi-\nmum dynamic pressure and acceleration, heat flux, mini-\nmum inter-visibility between ground stations, reentry\ntrajectories for dropped stages, and so forth. The perfor-\nmance criterion is thereafter defined, which can vary\nstrongly depending on the case under consideration.\n\nDuring the early design of a launcher, the optimization\nmay be done considering a given objective payload for the\nreference mission, seeking to minimize the total mass at\nliftoff. Then, once the design is frozen, trajectory optimi-\nzation will be done for other missions, maximizing the\npayload mass.\n\nDuring the production phase, once both the launcher and\nthe payload are defined, the optimization process can\n\nmaximize other parameters, such as safety on the ground,\nground stations visibility or performance reserve.\n\nThe optimization itself is classical, for which various\ntechniques exist such as direct methods for which variations\naround a local solution are computed, or indirect methods\nwhere the necessary conditions of optimality are satisfied\nbefore improving the criterion; the most commonly used\nindirect method follows the Pontryagin principle which was\nestablished in 1962.\n\n8.3.3 Trajectory Simulations\n\nOnce a launcher trajectory is optimized, simulations can be\nperformed considering variation around the nominal values\nwithin each input to a domain, representing either disper-\nsions or unknowns. This will include a model of the real\navionics performances, and can even include potential\nfailures. Simulating a trajectory with these dispersed\nparameters enables the robustness of the nominal solution\npreviously determined to be established, and to ascertain a\nflight domain. This process is fundamental, and is the only\nreal evaluation of the probability of achieving the required\norbit while complying with all the constraints. Simulations\nare usually performed using mathematical tools such as a\nMonte-Carlo analysis.\n\n8.4 Launcher Guidance, Navigation\nand Control\n\nThe launch vehicle, after liftoff, is typically completely\nautonomous and must place the payload(s) in the proper\norbit, regardless of any disturbances. To that extent, the\nvehicle must ensure some management functions: ignition,\ncut-off, separations (stages, fairing, and so forth), pressuri-\nzation management, and flight control functions including\nguidance, navigation, and control (GNC), failure detection,\nredundancy, and so forth.\n\nVelocity, m/s\n\n0 2000 80001000 6000\n\nA\nlt\n\nit\nu\n\nd\ne,\n\n m\n\n20000\n\n80000\n\n100000\n\n120000\n\n140000\n\nDynamic Pressure: \n\n3000 4000 5000 7000\n0\n\n40000\n\n60000 First flux peak: Verticality Limit\n\nIncidence ~0\u00b0\n\nFairing jettisoned\n\nIntervisibility\n\nSecond flux peak: \n\nFirst stage re-entry\n\n3.15\n\n3\n\n2\n\nFig. 8.4 Trajectory\nconstraints\u2014Ariane 5 GTO\nmission; nominal trajectory in\nred\n\n8 Launch Systems 171\n\n\n\nGuidance, navigation, and control is discussed in detail\nin Chap. 12, but for convenience the GNC loop of a\nlauncher is presented in Fig. 8.5. It enables the launcher to\nthrust in the proper direction. The aerodynamic stability of\nthe launcher will often drive the frequency of the control\nloop, for instance on Ariane 5 this frequency is 14 Hz.\n\n8.4.1 Launcher Navigation\n\nThe navigation function aims to give at any time during the\nflight the position and velocity of the launcher. It must\naccount for the real shape of the Earth, and is typically\nbased on single, then double integration of accelerometers\nduring the propulsive phases. Navigation can be simplified\nduring long ballistic phases by using an analytic integration\nof the trajectory.\n\nNavigation can also make use of information coming\nfrom the global navigation satellite systems such as GPS,\nGalileo, BeiDou-Compass, or GLONASS, but the required\nmission precision generally does not impose the use of such\nservice, and independent operation is often preferred.\n\nDepending on the accuracy of the sensors, the orbital\nparameters are known with a given precision and inter-\nrelation, generally expressed as a covariance matrix, as in\nTable 8.2.\n\n8.4.2 Guidance\n\nOnce the effective position of the launcher is known, it is\ncompared in the on-board computer to the theoretical\n\nposition of the launcher at a given time of flight computed\nduring the final mission analysis, and the difference between\nthe two positions is determined. The guidance function aims\nto provide a thrust direction, during propulsive phases, in\norder to follow the optimal trajectory while minimizing the\npropellant consumption and fulfilling the trajectory con-\nstraints (final orbit, thermal fluxes, visibility from telemetry\nstations, and so forth).\n\nGuidance is a three-dimensional computation that takes\ninto account only the position of the center of gravity of the\nlauncher. Its outputs are the Euler angles defining the\nlauncher\u2019s attitude. The atmospheric phase is performed\nfollowing a table containing the pre-computed values of the\npitch and yaw angles as a function of time, or of relative\nvelocity, depending on the launcher and its robustness.\n\nBeyond the atmosphere, the trajectory is subdivided into\nsegments, the end of each corresponding to a key event of\nthe launch, for example, separation of the fairing, jettison-\ning of the stages, inter-visibility between ground stations,\nand so forth. At the end of each segment, a number of\nparameters have to be verified, such as orbital parameters\nand flux constraints. In some specific cases, where for\nexample a solid propelled stage is used, an additional\nconstraint may be imposed to control the impact location of\nthe empty stage on the ground. The \u2018neutral axis maneuver\u2019\ndefines a dedicated guidance law that is applied during the\nlast seconds of propulsion in order to generate a pitch\nmaneuver that will maintain a fixed impact point of the\ndropped stage by accounting for any propulsion dispersions\npreviously encountered.\n\n8.4.3 Control\n\nThe control function aims to maintain the behavior of the\nlauncher around a given trajectory, with the dual goal to\nimpart a zero-degree angle of attack during the flight in\norder to lower the mechanical constraints, and to guarantee\nthe required injection accuracy in orbit.\n\nTwo sets of disturbances must be accounted for\n\n\u2022 Internal disturbances come from the flexible modes of the\nstructure, the fluid sloshing modes, and more generally all\nuncertainties or dispersions such as delays, measurement\nprecisions, as so forth.\n\n\u2022 External disturbances are mainly encountered during the\natmospheric phase, such as the influence of wind.\n\nThe control loop has to deal with objectives of stability.\nThat is, a launcher is generally naturally unstable, meaning\nthat without control it will tilt and diverge from its nominal\ntrajectory before breaking apart. This stability objective is\nmainly dealt with in the frequency domain, whilst the\n\n, ,\n\nS\nto\n\np\n o\n\nrd\ner\n\ns\nLaunch \nvehicle \n\ndynamics\n\nSensor \nmeasurement\n\nNavigation\n\nGuidance\n\nControl\n\nActuator \nSelection & \nCommand\n\nSequencing\n\nX, V\n\nduration\n\nFig. 8.5 Launcher guidance, navigation and control loop\n\n172 C. Bonnal et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_12\n\n\ncontrol loop will also deal with reactivity constraints in the\ntime domain.\n\nVarious sensors are used as inputs to the control loop,\nsuch as inertial systems giving angular measurements, and\nrate gyros giving angular velocities. Accelerometers also\nprovide transverse acceleration data that can be used to limit\nthe angle of attack during the atmospheric flight. The output\nof the control loop will command the various actuators that\nswivel the engines during the propulsive phases, or open the\nsecondary thrusters during the ballistic phases.\n\nThe stability conditions of a launcher can be determined\nby considering the forces acting on a launcher, as seen in\nFig. 8.2. The fundamental principle of dynamics gives the\nconditions of stability both in position and in angle\n\nX\n~Forces \u00bc\n\nd m~V\n? ?\ndt\n\n\u00f08:19\u00de\n\nand\n\nX\n~Torques \u00bc d I~x\u00f0 \u00de\n\ndt\n\u00f08:20\u00de\n\nwith m the mass of the launcher, V its vectorial velocity,\nI its inertia matrix, and x its angular velocity as a vector. As\nseen previously, Eq. 8.19 enables the computation of the\nlauncher trajectory. Equation 8.20 is used to determine the\nconditions of stability of the launcher around one axis, here\nchosen as the pitch axis\n\n\u20acH \u00bc Pd ? Sref ? Cmi ? Lf\nI\n\n? i\u00fe Fp ? Lt\nI\n? b \u00f08:21\u00de\n\nwhere (using the same notations as in Fig. 8.2) H is the\nlocal attitude angle along the pitch axis, Pd is the dynamic\npressure, Sref is the reference surface, Cmi is the pitch\ncoefficient derival with respect to incidence, Lf is the dis-\ntance from the center of lift to center of gravity, I is the\ninertia of the launcher along the pitch axis, i is the inci-\ndence, FP is the propulsive force, Lt is the distance from\nengine gimbal to the center of gravity, and b is the\ndeflection angle of the engine. This equation, fundamental\nfor all the control analyses, is often written as\n\n\u20acH \u00bc A6 ? i\u00fe K1 ? b \u00f08:22\u00de\n\nwith\n\nA6 \u00bc Pd ? Sref ? Cmi ?

A positive A6 denotes an\nunstable launcher, and a negative one a stable launcher. K1\nexpresses the deflection efficiency, or the propensity of the\nlauncher to come back to a null incidence in response to the\nswiveling of its propulsion.\n\nUsing the Laplace formalism, the stability conditions can\nbe written in a simplified way as an open-loop transfer\nfunctions between attitude and deflection\n\nF s\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc H\nb\n\u00bc K1\n\ns2 ?

The major\nspecificities come from the domain of flight, covering all of\nthe velocity domain up to orbit, including transition through\n\nTable 8.2 Example of a covariance matrix on orbital parameter in GTO (CNES)\n\na (km) ex (-) ey (-) i (rad) X (rad) x ?

Then these dimensioning\ncases have to be transformed into mechanical constraints,\ntraction or compression, applicable to all the elements con-\nstituting the structure of the launcher. Finally, material choices\nhave to be made, and the different thicknesses of the elements\ndefined taking into account manufacturing constraints.\n\n8.5.1 External Environment\n\nAerology\n\nThe first element that has to be taken into account in the\nmechanical dimensioning of a launcher is the wind, both on\nthe ground and in flight. Wind is a highly variable and\nturbulent phenomenon, which depends on the season and\nthe altitude. It is composed of a mean component and\nfluctuant parts. In flight, wind plays a major role in the\ncontrol of the launcher, as it adds some angle of attack\nduring the atmospheric phase.\n\nKnowledge of the wind profiles to be applied comes\nmainly from all the measurements performed by the mete-\norological team(s) of a launch base. The measures can be\ndone using sounding rockets, meteorological balloons, or\nradio soundings. The merging of these measures, average\nwinds established with balloons, and the meso-scale wind\nprofile determined by radio-sounding, gives what is called\n\u2018real\u2019 winds. As an output, a statistical base is used to\ngenerate dimensioning winds and enable realistic statistical\nanalyses, thus avoiding the need to take the worst case\nscenario at each altitude. Finally, some gusts may be added,\nfollowing a profile leading to a maximum wind (typically\n9 m/s) over a given length (for instance 100 m) determined\nby the length of the launcher.\n\nAerodynamics\n\nSteady aerodynamics are fundamental for launch vehicle\ndimensioning as they play a major role in the computation\nof performances, through the drag, the control at liftoff, the\nstructural dimensioning, and the aero-heating of the\nstructures.\n\nTwo forces are encountered: pressure forces, normal to a\nstructural element, and tangential friction forces. Practi-\ncally, viscous effects are felt only on a limited zone very\nclose to the surface, called the boundary layer, which marks\nthe limit between computations in real fluid and viscous\nfluid. The representativeness of such phenomena between\n\nground tests and flight is determined by considering the\nReynolds number, introduced in Chap. 5 as ratio between\nconvective and viscous phenomenon. The Reynolds number\nmarks the limit between laminar and turbulent flows.\n\nAt general launcher level, six coefficients are defined:\nthree force coefficients and three moments, respectively CA\n(axial, or drag), CN (normal, or lift), CY (side), Cl (roll), Cm\n(pitch), and Cn (yaw). Figure 8.6 gives a typical structure of\nthese global aerodynamic coefficients. An additional global\naerodynamic coefficient that is widely used is CNa, which is\nthe linearized deprival of the lift versus the angle of attack;\nit is a key parameter in the definition of the aerodynamic\nefficiency A6 used in control stability studies.\n\nLocally, on an elementary surface, two coefficients are\ndefined: the pressure coefficient, which the ratio between\nthe infinite pressure (i.e. sum of static and dynamic pres-\nsures) and the local pressure applied on the element, and the\nfriction coefficient. These coefficients are then integrated all\nover the elementary surfaces of the launcher to obtain the\ndistributed aerodynamic loads and these are then used for\nthe mechanical dimensioning. Figure 8.7 gives a typical\nexample for the Ariane 5 launcher in the yaw plane at Mach\n0.98.\n\nSome unsteady aerodynamic phenomenon should also be\ntaken into account, such as the unsteady acoustic aerody-\nnamic effects that generate random pressure fluctuations.\nAcoustic effects are generally not critical in dimensioning\nthe main launcher structure, but are a significant contributor\nto large-scale vibrations (20\u20132,000 Hz). Such excitations\nare important for launcher equipment and payloads (satellite\nor human), and are most important during liftoff (noise from\nengine plume and blast wave), during transonic flight, and\nmaximum dynamic pressure (buffeting), depending on the\n\nX\n\nZ\n\nY\n\nFig. 8.6 Typical definition of global aerodynamic coefficients\n\n174 C. Bonnal et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_5\n\n\ncoupled design of the launch pad, the launcher and the type\nof propulsion used.\n\nThe blast wave induced by the exhaust plume can be\nencountered on large launchers at liftoff, either coming\ndirectly from the duct inlets and raising along the launcher\n(ignition overpressure, IOP), or coming from the duct out-\nlets and laterally exciting the launcher (duct overpressure,\nDOP). This deterministic overpressure field leads to high-\nlevel lateral excitation at low frequency, typically below\n20 Hz.\n\nSeveral other unsteady aerodynamic phenomenon can\nalso play an important role in the structural dimensioning of a\nlauncher, depending on its shape definition. One is buffeting,\na pressure fluctuation imposed mainly on the fairing at liftoff.\nAnother is base instability, which occurs when the cross-\nsection of the launcher is sharply reduced, leading to a very\nturbulent flow recirculation, with potential reattachment of\nthe flow on the nozzle of the engines inducing strong side\nloads and vibrations transmitted to the complete launcher.\n\nThermal dimensioning\n\nA launcher is submitted to extreme thermal conditions\n\n\u2022 Internal temperatures range from very cold, with cryo-\ngenic temperatures such as the 20 K of liquid hydrogen,\nto very hot, such as the 3,000 K within a rocket engine\ncombustion chamber.\n\n\u2022 The external conditions are generated by the very high\nspeed in the atmosphere, leading to friction and com-\npression of the air and an increase of temperature that\nimposes a need for dedicated thermal protection; mainly\nfor a reentering vehicle.\n\n\u2022 Outside the atmosphere, a launcher stage is highly sen-\nsitivity to radiation, which can lead to very hot structures\nfacing the Sun, and to very cold temperatures in the\nshadow, therefore imposing a high thermal gradient.\n\nThere is a need to define properly the thermal protections\nto be applied on every element of a launch vehicle, taking\n\ninto account the various heat transfer mechanisms and the\nvarious phases of its life (including ground phases). For a\ncryogenic upper stage, its mission may require separate\ntanks to facilitate the necessary insulation and minimize the\nthermal inputs.\n\nThree heat transfer mechanisms must be taken into\naccount\n\n\u2022 Convection is the transfer process executed by the flow of\na fluid (liquid or gas medium); it is negligible outside the\natmosphere. Convection can be natural, due to the natural\nexchange between walls and atmosphere, or forced,\nmainly in the cavities which must remain within a given\ntemperature range during the flight. The estimation of\nconvective fluxes is a difficult task, leading to the use of\nsemi-empirical formulas and computational fluid\ndynamic (CFD) models validated by ground tests. It is\nglobally proportional to the difference in temperature\nbetween air and structure.\n\n\u2022 Conduction is the transfer process associated with the\npropagation of heat inside materials without any motion\n(solid medium). Materials range from good conductors,\ntypically metals such as aluminum, to good isolators, typi-\ncally foams used to protect cryogenic tanks. It is also pro-\nportional to the difference in temperature, following\nFourier\u2019s law. It should be noted that for a reentry vehicle,\ndue to the heat soak-back effect (inertia effect), the temper-\nature of the structure may reach its maximum after reentry.\n\n\u2022 Radiation is the transfer process linked to the energy\ncarried out by an electromagnetic wave (no medium\nrequired), and is the main driver in vacuum. It is pro-\nportional to the temperature difference raised to the fourth\npower. The radiative exchange factor is usually computed\nusing a Monte-Carlo method (randomization on ray\ndirections), and takes into account wall geometry (areas,\nview factors), thermo-optical properties, and transfer by\nmultiple reflections. A significant contributor to these\nthermal fluxes is the radiative heat flux induced by rocket\nengines and the rockets jet plumes in the infrared band.\n\nThe thermal dimensioning of a structure must take into\naccount all three heat flux transfer processes, both on the\nground and in flight, which leads to complex computations\nfor the two dimensioning cases, hot and cold. A variety of\ncontrol solutions are available, both passive (various ther-\nmal protections) and active (phase change material, forced\ncirculation, and so forth).\n\n8.5.2 General Loads\n\nThe general loads applied to the structure(s) of a launcher\nare the mechanical loads generated at the global launcher\n\n5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50-5\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n-5\n\nY (m)\n\nX (m)\n\nFig. 8.7 Distributed aerodynamic loads; example of Ariane 5 in the\nyaw plane at Mach 0.98 (CNES)\n\n8 Launch Systems 175\n\n\n\nscale, to which are added the local effects.

This diagram establishes firstly the dis-\ntribution of loads, following the left curve. Depending on\nthe dispersion of the stresses, for instance linked to the\natmospheric density, the propulsion characteristics, or the\neffective trajectory followed, a Gaussian distribution can be\ndefined with a maximum at the \u2018average\u2019 flight, and higher\nvalues for more \u2018severe\u2019 ones. This defines the dimension-\ning strength to which the structure will be subjected. Sim-\nilarly, the distribution of strength can be defined following\nthe effective robustness of the structure, on the right curve,\ndepending for instance on the effective specific strength of\nthe materials used. This in turn defines the allowable stress\ncurve to which the structure can be subjected.\n\nA safety factor, j, is defined as the ratio between the\nminimal allowable stress at 1 % probability, and the max-\nimal strength at 99 % probability. Such a safety factor is\nusually considered at 1.25 for ultimate stresses.\n\nThe general loads computation is performed by considering\n\u2018cuts\u2019 in the launcher at various altitudes, called stations, where\nthe loads induced to the lower part are computed (aerody-\nnamics, thrust and inertial effects) while also accounting for\nthe loads coming from the upper parts. Three components are\nthen defined: N which is the normal load, T which is the shear\nload, and M the moment applied to the station. As the station is\nstationary at any time, due to structural resistance of the\njunction, the same three components apply one-for-one at both\nthe lower and the upper parts of a given station.\n\nGeneral loads can be split into quasi-static loads, which\nrepresent the slow temporal evolution of the loads, and\ndynamic loads, which are the temporal evolutions of the\nloads for various bands of frequencies. This dynamic part can\nbe analyzed either by identifying the stresses as a function of\nthe time of their occurrence, or in the frequency domain, with\neach phenomenon being linked to one band of frequency.\n\n8.5.3 Architecture and Structural\nDimensioning\n\nA launcher is usually composed of several propulsive stages\nlinked together by inter-stage skirts, or struts and bolts (for\nthe side boosters), has a vehicle equipment bay, and is\ntopped by a fairing protecting the payload(s).\n\nEach propulsive stage is itself composed of several\npropellant and pressurant tanks (if liquid), and engine(s)\nlinked to the main structure through thrust frames. A stage\u2019s\noverall architecture may be a function of several consider-\nations, such as the effects of adjacent parameters, design for\nmanufacture, geometrical and functional or even technical\nconstraints, kinematics and dynamics at the system level,\nand any number of secondary requirements.\n\nThe propellant tanks can themselves present a wide\nvariety of designs, with common bulkheads or separate\ntanks, or inclusive tanks with one nested inside the other. A\ndiverse range of shapes can also be used: for example\ncylindrical-ellipsoidal, cylindrical-spherical, toroidal, and\nconical. Their link to the main structure depends on the\noverall architecture: they can be integral, carrying all the\nloads, clustered, or suspended inside the structure.\n\nThe selection of material(s) for the primary structure(s)\nis a complex function of the influence of the stage on\nlauncher performance and its various trade-off criteria, a\ncompromise between production and operational aspects,\nand a function of the specific strength, stiffness and required\ndegree of anisotropy. Such structures are generally made of\nmetal or composite. Metals are usually aluminum alloys\nincluding aluminum\u2013lithium, steel, and titanium. Compos-\nites are often carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP).\nStructures are also often based on sandwich technologies,\nfor instance aluminum sandwich within two CFRP face-\nsheets. Launcher design generally a compromise between\nachieving a high strength level and a lightweight concept.\nThe most influential parameters are strength, elasticity,\ndensity, fracture toughness, manufacturing, fuel compati-\nbility, and corrosion resistance.

This stress can be relieved by internal\npressure inside the structure, and corresponding formulas\nare well known for isotropic structures; however, it is\nmuch more complex for anisotropic structures such as\ncomposites. Stiffeners may be added to the structure to\nimprove its tolerance to buckling; various shapes of\nstiffeners are commonly used, straight, or X for instance.\n\n\u2022 Stiffness sizing is associated with requirements at the\nstage or launch vehicle level, considering the frequency\nof the main structural modes. Stiffness is a function of the\nYoung\u2019s modulus of the selected material.\n\nThese methods are classical, not specific to launch\nvehicles, and are widely used for any structural dimen-\nsioning in any mechanical domain.\n\n8.6 Launch Vehicle Rocket Propulsion\n\nThe main function of a rocket propulsion system is to\ngenerate a force, called thrust, which when applied to the\nadjacent structure induces an acceleration in the direction\nopposite to the engine flow.\n\nOn a launch system, such engines can be used either to\ngenerate the main acceleration of the launcher, enabling it\nto reach the desired velocity, for instance the orbital\nvelocity in the case of an orbital stage or to generate a\ntorque on the stage following any of the six degrees of\nfreedom in order to guarantee the attitude control of the\nassembly. This torque is composed of small forces along the\nthree translational axes, or the three moments around the\nthree axes to enable the proper orientation, for instance\nprior to the separation of the payloads.\n\nThe principle of a rocket engine is to eject rapidly gases\nthat, by equal and opposite reaction, produce the thrust.\nRocket engines can be based on a wide variety of propel-\nlants, which are discussed in detail in Chap. 11, and are\nintroduced here\n\n\u2022 Cold gases can be used when only low thrusts are\nrequired, for instance for the attitude control of an upper\nstage prior to payload separation. The cold gases tradi-\ntionally used for this can be gaseous hydrogen or nitro-\ngen. There is no combustion, just a pressure decrease\ngenerating the ejected mass flow.\n\n\u2022 Monopropellants are often used on small launchers for\nthe propulsion of the orbital stage, or as attitude control\nsystems for larger ones. The principle is to use a highly\nexothermic propellant decomposed on a catalytic bed.\nThe heat released by the decomposition increases the\nenthalpy of the gases and the ejection velocity. The\nmonopropellant most widely used today is hydrazine\n(N2H4).\n\n\u2022 Bipropellant can generate thrust from several newtons up\nto 8,000+ kN for larger engines. The principle is to per-\nform an oxido-reduction reaction between an oxidizer\n\nTable 8.3 Main mechanical characteristics of the most common materials; q is the density of the material, rr its rupture strength, E its Young\u2019s\nmodulus\n\nMaterial q (kg/m3) rr (kg/m\n3) E (M Pa) rq (10\n\n3) E\nq\n\nMagnesium alloys 1,800 230 42,000 128 23\n\nTitanium alloys 4,500 920 115,000 204 25\n\nAluminum alloys 2,800 400 72,000 143 26\n\nSteel alloys 7,800 1,050 205,000 135 26\n\n2311,800\n\nKevlar 49 fiber/epoxy (unidirectional) 1,370 1,600 85,000 1,168 62\n\nHR carbon fiber/epoxy (unidirectional) 1,560 1,400 130,000 897 83\n\nHM carbon fiber/epoxy (unidirectional) 1,660 1,100 250,000 663 150\n\n8 Launch Systems 177\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_11\n\n\nand a fuel, with the chemical reaction occuring within the\ncombustion chamber generating high enthalpy gases that\nare ejected through the nozzle of the engine. The oxi-\ndizers most commonly used are oxygen and N2O4 and\nderived components. The most frequent fuels are hydro-\ngen, kerosene and products derived from hydrazine, such\nas monomethyl-hydrazine (MMH) for upper stages or\ndimethyl-hydrazine (UDMH), mixed or not with another\nfuel, for, mainly lower stage. Methane and liquid natural\ngas are considered for future engines.\n\n\u2022 Solid propellant motors are also based on oxido-reduction\nreactions, but the oxidizer and the fuel are mixed, gen-\nerally blended with a binder, and stored in a solid form\ninside the engine body itself.\n\nWhatever the engine, the principle is always the same: a\nhigh-pressure chamber leads to a convergent-divergent\nthroat connected to a nozzle that accelerates the gases to\ngenerate thrust.\n\nCharacteristic Velocity\n\nConsidering the flow rate equation at the nozzle throat\n\n_m \u00bc At ? q ? V \u00f08:26\u00de\n\nwith _m the mass flow (kg/s), At the throat area (m\n2), q the\n\ndensity of the gases inside the chamber (kg/m3), and V the\nexhaust velocity of gases at the throat plane (m/s), an\nimportant coefficient can be derived called the characteristic\nvelocity, denoted c*.

It\nenables a comparison between propellants (c* is the reverse\nof Cd or discharge coefficient, the ratio of mass flow rate, _m,\nat the nozzle exhaust to that of an ideal nozzle expanding an\nidentical fluid over the same pressures, i.e. a ratio of actual\nto theoretical discharge)\n\nThrust Coefficient\n\nWhen combining the equation of propulsion, the flow rate at\nthe nozzle throat, Eq. 8.26, and the velocity of the gases at\nthe outlet of the nozzle, the ejection velocity, ve, may be\nwritten, in (m/s), as\n\nve \u00bc\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2c\n\nc? 1\nRTc\nM\n\n1?

In reality, both processes\nare less than perfect and encounter some losses, leading to\nperformances lower than foreseen in theory. There may be\nlosses associated with incomplete or not fully-stabilized\ncombustion, thermal exchanges losses, friction losses as\nwell as those linked to non-ideal expansion in the nozzle.\n\nPractically, each of the previous coefficients is affected by\nan efficiency coefficient which has to be taken into account\nwhen determining the real performance of a rocket engine.\nTypical values of such efficiencies are gc? \u00bc 0:99 indicating\nthe combustion efficiency for liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen\n(LOX/LH2), and gCF \u00bc 0:975 indicating the nozzle quality.\n\n8.6.1 Liquid Propulsion\n\nWhile the origins of solid propulsion can be traced back\nmore than 2,000 years, liquid propulsion is a rather recent\ndevelopment in the field of rocket propulsion. Although\nKonstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857\u20131935) published in 1903\nabout the application of a liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen,\n\n178 C. Bonnal et al.\n\n\n\nLOX/LH2-fuelled engine in multi-stage rockets, it was not\nuntil 1926 that Robert Goddard (1882\u20131945) launched the\nfirst liquid fuelled rocket. This was quickly followed by\nrocket enthusiasts in Germany, Hermann Oberth\n(1894\u20131989) and Wernher von Braun (1912\u20131977), and\nRussia, Friedrich Zander (often transliterated Fridrikh\nTsander, 1887\u20131933), Sergei Korolev (1907\u20131966), and\nValentin Glushko (1908\u20131989). Interestingly, all of them\nused liquid oxygen as oxidizer but different hydrocarbons\nfuels: Goddard, gasoline, von Braun, alcohol, and Korolev\u2019s\nand Zander\u2019s group in Moscow at the Group for the\nInvestigation of Reaction Propulsion (GIRD) a gelled gas-\noline and thus this engine has to be considered the first\nhybrid rocket engine (1933).\n\nThe first LOX/LH2 engine ever flown was the American\nRL-10, an expander cycle engine with 7 tons of thrust that\nwas used in 1963 in the Centaur second stage of an Atlas\nlauncher. There were three competitive Moon launcher\nproposals in the Soviet Union, UR-700, Yangel\u2019s R-56,\nChelomei\u2019s UR-700 and Korolev\u2019s N1. The N1 was finally\nchosen and its N1-L3 M version foresaw the RD-57, a\n40 tons thrust closed cycle engine for the third and fourth\nstages. As of 2013, Russia holds the records for the most\npowerful hydrocarbon and storable engines ever build; the\nclosed cycle RD-171 and RD-275 engines with about 835\nand 175 tons of thrust. The Space Shuttle Main Engine\n(SSME) still leads the charts of closed cycle cryogenic\nengines with 218 tons thrust. Further discussion of liquid\npropellant rockets can be found in Chap. 11.\n\n8.6.1.1 Application Domains and Propellants\nLiquid propellant rocket engines are used for all types of\napplications in rocketry: for booster, sustainer, and upper\nstage engines, for reaction control, for apogee purposes in\nsatellite delivery, and for satellite propulsion and attitude\ncontrol. Hence, the thrust level span of liquid rocket engines\nranges from almost 10 MN for booster engines down to 1 N\nfor attitude control, and the growing interest for micro-\npropulsion systems has led to the development of milli-\nnewton propulsion systems. The thrust of an engine is\nproportional to the mass flow rate going through it and to\nthe exit velocity, which (among factors such as the pro-\npellant combination, which defines the heat released, and\nthe weight of the exhaust gases) depends on the ambient\npressure. Hence, booster engines that are supposed to pro-\nvide the necessary high-thrust at liftoff are characterized by\nlarge mass flow rates at moderate specific impulses. With\ndecreasing ambient pressure and significantly reduced thrust\nrequirements at higher altitudes, upper stage engines usually\nhave rather limited mass flow rates but should operate at the\nhighest possible specific impulse because they burn pro-\npellant that has already been accelerated, and is thus of\nconsiderable value. This is the main reason that upper stage\n\nengines usually operate with LOX/LH2, which has the\nhighest specific impulse of the traditional propellant\ncombinations.\n\nAlthough there is a large number of possible propellant\ncombinations, only a few are operational. The oxidizers\ninclude liquid oxygen (LOX) and dinitrogen tetroxide\n(N2O4); typically referred to simply as nitrogen tetroxide,\nNTO. Kerosene fuel derivatives of hydrazine include\nmonomethyl-hydrazine (MMH) but this is principally\nrestricted to upper stages because it costs approximately\nthree times that of the unsymmetrical dimethyl-hydrazine\n(UDMH) that is often used for boosters. Pure hydrazine is\nmainly used as a monopropellant for attitude control, or\nsometimes associated with NTO for small apogee engines.\nThe other common fuel is liquid hydrogen. Generally, high-\ndensity propellants are used for booster applications, i.e.\nRD-275, RD-180, while LOX/LH2 are either core engines,\ni.e. SSME, LE-7A or Vulcain 2, or upper stage engines such\nas the RL-10, HM7B, LE-5A or RD-0124. Typical sea-level\nspecific impulse values of storable engines are below 300 s;\nLOX/hydrocarbon engines may reach 310 s, but are still far\nbelow cryogenic engines. The SSME or the Vulcain 2,\nwhich are both designed for optimum performance at higher\naltitudes, provide sea-level specific impulses values around\n360 and 340 s, respectively.\n\nThe propellant choice can often result from a combina-\ntion of system requirements, company experience and\ncapabilities, and recurring and non-recurring costs. Hence,\nupper stage engines can be found with all the propellant\ncombinations mentioned previously, i.e. the storable pres-\nsure-fed AESTUS engine, the LOX/kerosene closed cycle\nRD-58 M engine, and the cryogenic expander cycle RD-\n0124 with vacuum specific impulses of 324, 353, and 459 s,\nrespectively. The main advantage of storable propellants is\ntheir hypergolic nature, which provides for engine ignition\nwithout any additional subsystem and offers even re-igni-\ntion capabilities. Engine re-ignition after a cruise phase is\nmandatory for the release of multiple payloads into different\norbits.\n\n8.6.1.2 Engine Thermodynamic Cycles\nLiquid propellant rocket engines are divided into two cat-\negories depending on the type of fuel feeding technology:\npressure-fed or pump-fed. The first are the simplest, the\nlatter require additional subsystems such as gas generators\nor preburners, turbopumps or heat exchangers. Typical\npressure-fed engines have a rather lower combustion\nchamber pressure which limits both the attainable specific\nimpulse and the thrust because they use gas stored in high-\npressure tanks (typically 30 MPa helium). Most of the\nengines used in launchers work with turbomachines to\nprovide the required mass flow rates at the design pressure\nto the combustion chamber. Pump-fed engines can be\n\n8 Launch Systems 179\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_11\n\n\ndistinguished according to the method they use to generate\nthe hot gases that drive the turbines.\n\nOpen cycle engines burn some of the propellant in a gas\ngenerator that quite often operates fuel-rich in order to limit\nthe temperature of the combustion products to acceptable\nvalues, and they discard the turbine exhaust gases at low\npressure\u2014a procedure that lowers the overall performance\nof the engines since it does not use all the fuel to generate\nthrust. Such engines are limited in combustion chamber\npressure to about 12 MPa and they therefore, tend to\nbecome rather large at high-thrust levels. Nevertheless, they\nhave the advantage that the interface between the thrust\nchamber and the turbopump is simple, their components and\nsubsystems can be developed independently, and they have\na rather moderate pressure level throughout the system. A\npressure-fed system is shown in Fig. 8.9 alongside three\ndifferent pump-fed systems: an open cycle gas generator, an\nexpander cycle, and a fuel-rich staged combustion cycle.\n\nClosed cycle engines generate their driving gas in a\npreburner similar to open cycle engines, but the pressure\nlevel at the turbine exit is still sufficient for the preburned\ngases to be injected into the main combustion chamber.\nThus, the entire propellant mass generates thrust. Obvi-\nously, such an engine has the potential to provide the\nhighest possible performance and allows for a compact\ndesign. The performance of a staged combustion (closed)\ncycle is compared in Fig. 8.10 against a gas generator\n(open) cycle. While at lower pressure the performance\ndifferences cannot justify the higher complexity of a closed\ncycle engine, the performance advantage becomes obvious\nat higher pressures where the open cycle engines runs into a\nlimit due to the increasing losses from the secondary flow\nthat is necessary to drive the turbines. Nevertheless, the\nclosed cycle systems require a complex development since\nthe subsystems are highly coupled. Additionally, engine\ntransients are much more complex due to the generally high\npressures and mass flow rates, and the multiple combustion\ndevices and components.\n\nA third version of a pump-fed engine is the expander\ncycle. Here the driving gases are not produced in combus-\ntion devices, but are generated by heat addition to one of the\npropellants during the cooling of the combustion chamber.\nSimilar to the open cycle gas generator, the expander cycle\nsuffers from a limitation of the attainable combustion\nchamber pressure. The main advantage of this cycle is a\nsimpler engine design, as it does not require another com-\nbustion chamber, and its ignition system. Furthermore, such\nan engine more readily fulfills the requirements for re-\nignition; because it lacks the second ignition system, and\nneither the pipes nor the turbines and other components\nbecome contaminated with combustion exhaust gases dur-\ning prior use.\n\nAmong the pump-fed cycles, there exist different ver-\nsions; for example, there is an expander bleed cycle where\nonly a small portion of the overall fuel mass flow rate is\nheated in the cooling channel of the engine and is then\ndumped as a film into the nozzle extension. The drastically\nincreased pressure ratio across the turbine allows for higher\ncombustion chamber pressures and an increased nozzle\nexpansion ratio at reduced size and weight, almost totally\ncompensating for the performance losses due to the partially\nopen cycle operation.\n\nWhile all flying staged-combustion engines operate oxi-\ndizer-rich (all Russian LOX/kerosene engines) or fuel-rich, a\nfuel-flow cycle engine in which both propellants are partially\npreburned would be optimum form a system point of view.\n\n8.6.1.3 Thrust Chamber Assembly: Injection\nSystem\n\nThe thrust chamber assembly consists of the propellant\nmanifolds, the injection head, the ignition system, the com-\nbustion chamber, and the thrust nozzle. The main purpose of\nthe propellant manifold is to homogenize the incoming pro-\npellant and provide an even flow to the injection system.\n\nThe injection system of a rocket engine has to fulfill a\nrather broad range of requirements. It serves a two-way\n\nFuel OX\nLOXFuelLOXFuel LOXFuelFig. 8.9 Flow schemes of\n\ndifferent thermodynamic engines\ncycle, from left to right: pressure-\nfed system, gas generator,\nexpander, and fuel-rich staged\ncombustion cycle\n\n180 C. Bonnal et al.\n\n\n\ndecoupling function, decoupling both the combustion\nchamber from the propellant supply lines, and the propellant\nmanifolds from the combustion chamber in order to ensure\nsufficient margin from low-frequency combustion instabil-\nities. It also has to provide a homogeneous distribution of\nthe propellant in the combustion chamber for an optimum\ncombustion efficiency, whilst providing all this with a\nminimum pressure loss for both, damping and atomization,\nand mixing, which amount typically to about 15\u201325 % of\nthe combustion chamber pressure. Depending on the com-\nbustion device (main chamber or gas generator), the engine\ncycle, the propellants, and more specifically on the phase of\nthe fluid, the injectors can be characterized as gas/gas or\ngas/liquid or liquid/liquid injectors.\n\nShear coaxial injectors, which now usually operate\nwithout swirl inducing elements are commonly used for\ngas/liquid applications where one of the propellants, mostly\nthe hydrogen, is used as coolant in the combustion chamber,\nand which in the case of hydrogen then enters the injector as\ncold supercritical gas.\n\nFor open and closed cycle cryogenic engines, shear\ncoaxial injectors are applied all over the world and can be\nconsidered as a standard injector that provides excellent\natomization and mixing, and combustion efficiencies in\nexcess of 99 %.

Image ASTRIUM\nGmbH\n\n8 Launch Systems 181\n\n\n\nthe liquid oxygen injectors with the metering orifices at the\nentrance, hydrogen distribution manifold, and the copper\ninserts that homogenize the hydrogen inflow into the\ncoaxial ring.\n\nThe classical liquid/liquid injector is an impinging\ninjector that exists in a large number of variations. They are\nall designed to form a liquid sheet prior to the atomization,\nand are characterized as like-on-like when jets of the same\npropellant type impinge on another, or like-on-unlike when\nthe fuel and an oxidizer jets are onto the liquid sheet.\nDepending on the number of impinging jets, they are called\ndoublet, triplets, quadruplets, and so on.\n\nRussia has a long tradition of swirl injectors, and their\nengines almost always use this type of injector for liquid/\nliquid applications instead of the impinging injectors that\nare common in European and American rocket engines.\n\nShowerhead injectors in which the oxidizer and fuel are\ninjected as parallel jets have currently fallen out of use.\nAnother type of injector, the American TRW pintle injector\nthat was applied in the Apollo Moon-lander engine to achieve\nits deep throttling function, has recently seen growing\ninterest due to its application in SpaceX\u2019s Merlin engines.\n\n8.6.1.4 Thrust Chamber Assembly: Ignition\nSystem\n\nEngine start-up and ignition are among the most severe\noperating conditions of a rocket engine. Malfunctions dur-\ning this critical phase often result in a catastrophic failure.\nHence the injector head, thrust chamber, ignition system\nand start-up sequence have to be designed and developed in\nparallel to ensure safe and stable operation.\n\nThe ignition system has to provide for the necessary\nenergy both in time and in space, and for long enough to\nignite the injected propellants. In order to fulfill this function\na number of conditions have to be met simultaneously. The\nmixture ratio of the propellants in the chamber has to be\nfavorable for ignition, and even more important for flame\nspreading and anchoring at the injectors. The energy pro-\nvided by the igniter has to be high enough to ensure propel-\nlant vaporization, and to preheat them above the ignition\ntemperature. With one or both propellants injected at around\n100 K this heat transfer is critical for the desired engine start-\nup. Typically, an ignition delay of several milliseconds will\noften yield an accumulation of enough propellants which,\nwhen they react, will result in pressure peaks that can be\ndangerous for the combustion chamber itself, or another\ncomponent of the engine cycle. Additionally, such pressure\npeaks can trigger combustion instabilities that can result in\ndamage to the component and loss of the entire mission.\n\nThe majority of the ignition systems flying today are\nsolid propellant charges that provide the necessary initiation\nenergy to the combustion chamber. A few systems use\nhypergolic assisted ignition, a method where for a short\n\nperiod of time a third type of liquid is injected, which reacts\nwithout further energy input with one of the propellants.\nFinally, for upper stage engines such as the European Vinci\nengine, electric igniters are used.\n\n8.6.1.5 Thrust Chamber Assembly: Combustion\nChamber Liner\n\nThe main objective of combustion chamber design is to\nburn completely the propellants, and to accelerate the\nexhaust gases to sonic velocities in the throat. Design dif-\nficulties are precise and it is difficult to make reliable pre-\ndictions of optimum liner contour, combustion efficiency,\nhot gas side and coolant side heat transfer, and appropriate\ncooling, combustion chamber life, and, of course, reliable\nand justifiable requirements and interface conditions to\nother components. The combustion chamber consist of a\nrelatively short cylindrical part and the throat area with a\nconverging and diverging part. The throat section is where\nthe highest thermal loads in the chamber are reached. The\ndiverging part of the chamber extends down to expansion\nratios of about 5\u20138, and is integrated into the combustion\nchamber using similar materials and cooling philosophy.\nThe thrust nozzle extension is a separate component often\nfabricated using a different material as well as a different\ncooling cycle, for example, film cooling, dump cooling or\nradiation cooling. The key challenge of the integrated\ncombustion chamber and nozzle design process is to predict\nthe cooling system behavior and combustion performance.\n\nThe heat transfer from the hot gases to the coolant is\ncoupled via the heat conductivity in the liner structure. It is\nworthwhile noting that in the typical operating conditions of\nrocket engines almost all of the thermo-physical properties\nof fluid and wall materials are not constant and are functions\nof the local temperature. The entire heat transfer problem\ncan only be solved in a fully coupled manner, but a coupled\nsolution based solely on numerical tools is not currently\nfeasible and cannot be expected in the near future. The\nreasons for this are both numerous and serious, including in\nparticular the differences in length scales of the combustion\nchamber, injector element, and boundary layer issues, the\ntime scales of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, finite-rate\nchemistry, the presence of areas with sub-, trans-, and\nsupersonic velocities, atomization in general and atomiza-\ntion under sub-, trans-, and supercritical conditions. The\nnecessity to implement a complex thermodynamic\ndescription of processes, specifically the properties and\nbehavior of gases, liquids and solids under cryogenic con-\nditions, adds further complexity. Furthermore, dissociation\nof the exhaust gases has a direct impact on the combustion\nefficiency. And finally, catalytic reactions at the surface\nmay additionally influence the local heat balance and thus\ninfluence the overall heat transfer. In the case of hydro-\ncarbon fuels, decomposition reactions due to pyrolysis in\n\n182 C. Bonnal et al.\n\n\n\nthe cooling channels may increase the complexity of the\ncoupled problem even further.\n\nWith all that said, it is rather obvious that semi- or fully\nempirical correlations in the form of Nusselt relations can\nbe used. A typical example is the Bartz equation, which\ndescribes the hot gas side heat transfer\n\nNu \u00bc 0:062 Re0:8Pr0:3 \u00f08:30\u00de\n\nwhere, 107 \\ Re \\ 108, and Pr * 0.5. Various modifica-\ntions of this basic relation have been used to make use of\nknown or measured local geometrical quantities or ther-\nmodynamic and fluid properties that influence the local heat\ntransfer, in order either to improve the predictive capabili-\nties of the relation for a given set of operating conditions or\nto enlarge the parameter range of their application.

The most\nsophisticated try to quantify the influence of geometry,\nchemistry, thermodynamic and fluid dynamic state in the\nform of products of non-dimensional relations with varying\ncoefficient in the form of\n\nNu \u00bc K Rea Prb q\nqw\n\nffi ?c l\nlw\n\nffi ?d k\nkw\n\nffi ?e ?cp\ncp\n\nffi ?f p\npcr\n\nffi ?g\n1\u00fe 2D\n\nL\n\nffi ?m\n:\n\n\u00f08:34\u00de\n\nAll these correlations are based on different experiments\nby different working groups, and therefore the results and\nfinally the coefficients obtained depend on the experimental\nsetup, the facilities, the operating conditions, and the mea-\nsuring techniques applied, and consequently include all the\nknown and unknown errors.\n\n8.6.1.6 Thrust Chamber Assembly: Cooling\nand Thrust Chamber Life\n\nThe standard cooling method in rocket engines for launcher\napplications is regenerative cooling, which is sufficient for\nchamber pressures of up to roughly 100 bars. One propel-\nlant, typically the fuel, enters through a distribution mani-\nfold at the end of the combustion chamber and flows in the\ncounter-flow direction upstream through cooling channels\nto the injector head, thus entering the combustion chamber\npreheated through appropriately designed injectors. Both\nthe hot gas side and the coolant side heat transfer that\ndefines the overall thermal loads and the cooling channel\npressure loss are extremely dependent on the cooling\nchannel design. However, at higher pressures and heat loads\nit is common to apply additional film cooling using cold\nfuel. Such a film not only acts as a coolant, which reduces\nthe heat pick-up requirement in the cooling channels and\ntherefore helps to reduce the pressure losses, but also pro-\ntects the walls in the injector region from chemical attacks.\nFilm cooling as the sole cooling method can only be applied\nin low-pressure satellite engines. Ablative cooling may be\nseen as a special form of film cooling, and has been applied\neither in the throat region of medium-pressure short burn-\ntime booster engines, or in low-pressure satellite engines.\nThe functional principle is based on the interaction of the\nfollowing phenomena: heat input from the hot gas flow\nleads to a melting and vaporization of the wall material and\nthis, together with an endothermic reaction, establishes a\nnear-wall coolant film. Materials used are carbon, carbon/\ncarbon (C/C) or silicon carbide (SiC) structures without\ninfiltrated hydrocarbons.\n\nWhile combustion chambers are cooled in a closed cycle\nmode, thrust nozzles are either cooled in an open cycle mode\ncalled \u2018dump cooling\u2019 or through radiation cooling. Obvi-\nously, this method relies on materials that can withstand\nhigh temperatures and is thus only applicable in satellite\nengines or in extension of thrust nozzles. Independent of the\nmaterial applied, refractory metals such as tungsten, W,\nrhenium, Re, or iridium, Ir, or ceramic matrix composites,\nthe surface of thrusters that work within the atmosphere has\nto be equipped with an oxygen protection layer. Upper stage\nengines such as the RL10-B or the new Vinci usually use a\nceramic matrix composite (CMC) nozzle extension. It is\nworth noting that radiation cooled thrusters or nozzles\nrequire a shield system that protects sensitive engine parts or\nmeasurement equipment from high heat loads.\n\nThrust chambers are exposed to high thermal and\nmechanical stresses coming from internal and external\nsources. Mechanical loads resulting from high pressures in\nthe cooling channels and the combustion chamber are\ncombined with thermally induced loads resulting from steep\ntemperature gradients and large temperature differences in\nthe liner walls. During transient operation, additional\n\n8 Launch Systems 183\n\n\n\nmechanical loads may result from flow separation induced\nside loads in the nozzle or through gimbaling of the engine.\nThese extreme loads can lead to two different failure modes:\nfatigue and rupture. Repeated cyclic loads, which are usually\ncharacterized according to the frequency of their occurrence\nas either low cycle fatigue (LCF) or high cycle fatigue\n(HCF), contribute to the fatigue that is additionally aggra-\nvated by high temperature creep of the material under plastic\nstrain over an extended period of time (creep fatigue). There\nis another damage effect described as \u2018blanching\u2019, which is\ncaused by a chemical attack of oxygen radicals of the liner\nsurface in the vicinity of the injector face plate. Some of the\nloads described previously become more severe during\nengine start-up and shutdown when extreme temperature\ngradients are reached and the thermal stresses are coupled\nwith transient mechanical loads. The classical fatigue dom-\ninated failure mode is a rupture of the cooling channel called\nthe \u2018dog-house\u2019 effect. The left part of Fig. 8.12 shows a cut\nthrough the combustion chamber liner with the beginning of\nthe dog-house effect visible through a roughening of the hot\ngas side wall. In the right part of Fig. 8.12 the inner liner with\nthe typical combination of blanching and cracks after about\n20 cycles and more than 15,000 s of operation is shown. The\nconsequence of these combined loads is to make it almost\nimpossible to build, with current materials and manufactur-\ning techniques, a high-pressure and high-performance reus-\nable cryogenic rocket engine.\n\n8.6.1.7 Thrust Chamber Assembly: Oscillations\nand Combustion Instabilities\n\nExtremely high energy densities in combination with very\nlow internal losses make a rocket engine a nearly undamped\nsystem with high amplification, and thus very sensitive to\noscillations, the sources of which can be diverse. For\nexample, interactions of cavities in the propellant supply\nlines and the rocket engines, or interaction between the\npropellant distribution manifold and the injectors with the\ncombustion chamber and combustion noise itself.\n\nLow frequency induced oscillations, which result from\nresonances between of stage structures, propellants and the\nengine are called \u2018pogo oscillations\u2019 and, depending on the\nsize of the vehicle may vary around 100 Hz. Design\n\nengineers know how to avoid them by installing anti-pogo\ndevices into the fluid lines between the tanks and the\nengines to act as dampers. Furthermore, there is another\ntype of low frequency oscillation between the propellant\nlines and the engine, a phenomenon called \u2018chugging\u2019\nwhose typical frequencies may vary between 100 and\n700 Hz. Quite often, pressure-fed engines are more vul-\nnerable to this problem as they are designed for very low\npressure losses and thus have only marginal internal\ndamping. A major requirement for injectors of liquid pro-\npellant rocket engines is to provide for sufficient losses in\norder to increase the damping in the system.\n\nOscillations inside the combustion chamber can result\nfrom a coupling of the heat release with the eigenfrequency\nof the combustion volume. Resonances may occur within\nthese oscillations in preferred frequency bands, and give\nrise to combustion instabilities, a process which is charac-\nterized by very high pressure amplitudes that can destroy\nhardware within only a few acoustic cycles. These high\nfrequency oscillations continuously disrupt the boundary\nlayer and bring hot combustion gases to the walls, which in\ncombination with the high pressure peaks, produces local\nheat loads that can significantly exceed the material\u2019s limit.\n\nAlthough combustion instabilities have been the subject\nof extensive research within almost every development\nprogram of large rocket engines, the lack of an exact math-\nematical formulation of the phenomenon persists. Never-\ntheless, design engineers have found ways to tackle this\nproblem and either bypass it by implementing passive means\nsuch as acoustic cavities in the combustion chamber liner\nplaced in the vicinity of the face plate to modify the eigen-\nfrequency of the chamber, or by placing baffles inside the\ncombustion chamber to subdivide the volume into smaller\nones with different and higher characteristic frequencies.\nFurthermore, it is known that engines that burn hydrocarbon\npropellants are more sensitive to combustion instabilities\nthan LOX/LH2 engines, and that storable propellant engines,\nwhich quite often operate with impinging injectors, show an\neven higher sensitivity. Additionally, the likelihood of\ninstabilities increases with the diameter of the combustion\nchamber and is prevalent during the transient start-up and\nshutdown processes of the engines. Russian engineers of high\n\nFig. 8.12 Cut through a\ncombustion chamber liner (left),\nliner wall with blanching and\ncracks (right). Image ASTRIUM\nGmbH\n\n184 C. Bonnal et al.\n\n\n\nthrust engines often implement a design with multiple small\ncombustion chambers supplied by a single turbomachinery.\n\nIt is noteworthy that any newly developed rocket engine\nhas to undergo a well-defined experimental program that\nincludes bomb tests in which small solid charges are placed\ninside the chamber and ignited during engine operation to\ntrigger a steep pressure increase and then determine the\ndamping characteristic of the engine.\n\n8.6.1.8 Thrust Chamber Assembly: Nozzle\nTechnologies\n\nThrust nozzles have to be designed such that the hot com-\nbustion gases are accelerated to the maximum exhaust\nvelocity. The exhaust flow generated by a bell-shaped nozzle\nwith a parabolic contour is almost ideal with only a minor\nportion of non-parallelism. Typically, Russian nozzles have\nan ideal contour, which follows a classical wind tunnel design\nand which is adapted to the ambient pressure, while Ameri-\ncan, European and Japanese engines follow a thrust-opti-\nmized contour, which has a somewhat steeper opening near to\nthe throat and yields a shorter nozzle at similar expansion\nratio. It is of note that thrust-optimized nozzles are in general\nmore sensitive towards side loads during operational tran-\nsients. Hence, they require a somewhat more robust design\nthat may, to some extent, counteract the weight advantage.\n\nClassical booster engines, which typically operate for\nless than 3 min are less sensitive to flow separation induced\nside loads as their expansion ratio usually does not exceed\n20\u201330. Core engines such as the Japanese LE-7 or the\nEuropean Vulcain 2, which are ignited on the ground and\noperate for almost 10 min, have to be designed such that at\nsea level the nozzle operates in an over-expanded mode,\nmeaning that the exhaust pressure is substantially lower\nthan the ambient pressure, typically between 20 and 30 %.\nDuring transient start-up, flow separation may cause severe\nside loads and therefore the nozzle design is a compromise\nbetween safe start-up and high performance at high altitude.\n\nThere are at least four nozzle concepts available: the\nplug nozzle, the expansion-deflection nozzle, the dual bell\nnozzle, and the extendible nozzle, which one way or the\nother aim to adapt the flow to the ambient pressure. Two\nwell-known upper stage engines favor the concept of the\nexpandable nozzle, the American RL-10B and the European\nVinci, which both feature a ceramic matrix composite\n(CRC) nozzle extension. This is however, only for the\npurpose of reducing the height of the launcher, and the\nnozzle extension is deployed after the separation of the first\nstage, and prior to engine ignition.\n\n8.6.1.9 Thrust Chamber Assembly:\nManufacturing Issues\n\nThe design of a combustion chamber depends almost\nentirely on the applied cooling technologies described\n\npreviously. While low pressure engines might as well be\nmanufactured from film cooled and thermal barrier coated\nsteel, and short burning time engines such as the Viking\nengine might contain ablative inserts, the state-of-the-art of\nhigh pressure combustion chambers in the Western world is\na high heat conductivity inner liner that is combined with a\nhigh strength outer shell. The inner copper liner includes the\ncooling channels that are milled into the copper and then\nfilled with wax and closed either by electro-deposition or by\nbeing brazed to the outer nickel shell. The latter technology\nis widely used in Russia and has been applied to the\nAmerican RS-68 engine. The earlier tube design of the inner\nliner is limited to rather low combustion chamber pressures\nand is currently used only in low pressure upper stage\nengines such as the American RL-10.\n\n8.6.1.10 Thrust Chamber Assembly: Gas\nGenerators and Pre-burners\n\nThe main purpose of a gas generator, or in the case of a\nstaged combustion cycle engine a preburner, is to provide\nthe driving gases for the turbomachinery. The turbine power\nrequirement depends on the mass flow rate and thermody-\nnamic properties (cp, j, T1) of the driver gases, on the\nturbine efficiency, and the available pressure ratio (p2/p1)\nacross the turbine. Thus\n\nP \u00bc g _m cpT1 1?\np2\np1\n\nffi ? j?1\nj\u00f0 \u00de\n\n !\n\u00f08:35\u00de\n\nAll operational open cycle engines have gas generators\nrunning fuel-rich in order to limit the turbine entry tem-\nperature independently of the propellant combination; e.g.\nthe cryogenic Vulcain, the LOX/kerosene RD-180, or the\nstorable Viking engines. In contrast to closed cycle\nengines, in open cycle engines the turbine exit pressure p2\nand the combustion chamber pressure are not directly\ncoupled. Hence, open cycle gas generator pressure and the\nmain chamber pressure are typically in the same range,\nwhereas in closed cycle engines the preburner pressure\nmay exceed the chamber pressure by a factor of two.\nClassical closed cycle engines such as the cryogenic\nSSME or the LOX/kerosene RD-180 have chamber pres-\nsures of about 22.5 and 26.7 MPa, respectively and pre-\nburner pressures of 360 and 540 bars respectively. Due to\nthese already extreme mechanical and dynamical loads,\nthe turbine entry temperatures typically do not exceed\n900 K, and in order to avoid local thermal overloading of\nthe turbine blades a homogenous temperature distribution\nis extremely important. While all preburners of cryogenic\nclosed cycle engines operate in fuel-rich mode to limit the\nturbine entry temperatures, preburners of LOX/kerosene\nengines operate oxidizer-rich to avoid soot formation and\n\n8 Launch Systems 185\n\n\n\ndeposition either on the turbine blades or in the injection\nsystem.\n\nThe injectors used in fuel-rich gas generators are often\nsimilar to those applied in the main chamber because the\npropellant temperatures are only slightly different. In oxi-\ndizer-rich preburners, which are much more sensitive to\ncombustion instabilities, a two-stage combustion zone is\ndeveloped. In the first part of the chamber, a limited amount\nof oxygen is injected in order to keep the temperatures\nabove 2,000 K, and in the second part, the remainder of the\noxygen is injected to dilute the hot gases sufficiently to\nreach the desired turbine entry temperature. This secondary\ninjection also helps to achieve a homogenous temperature\nprofile. Problems of material compatibility of gas generator,\nfluid supply, and the turbine against hot oxidizer-rich gases\ncan be overcome either by passivation of the surfaces or by\nan appropriate coating.\n\n8.6.1.11 Thrust Chamber Assembly: Test Facilities\nWithin the development phase of an engine, all propulsion\nsystem components are usually tested in parallel and only\nlater qualified together as subsystems or engines using\nspecific test facilities. Such a development and testing\nmethodology requires various large-scale facilities that are a\nmajor cost driver.\n\nSystem tests facilitate characterization according to the\nengine type tested in sea-level and altitude simulation\nfacilities. Booster and main stage engines are tested at sea-\nlevel conditions, and upper stage, apogee, and satellite\nengines at high-altitude conditions. A characteristic feature\nof altitude simulation benches are the systems and instal-\nlations required in order to establish and maintain vacuum-\nlike conditions during engine firing.\n\nThere is a general rule: fly as you test and test as you fly,\nand no component, subsystem or engine will ever fly before it\nhas been demonstrated to fulfill the desired requirements and\nsafety margins. However, it is not always possible to totally\nrealize this principle. For example, the ambient pressure\nduring ascent decreases continuously, thereby changing the\nthrust as well as the pressure difference across the thrust\nnozzle. It is extremely costly to modify a test bench for large\nrocket engines to simulate the ascent, so such tests are often\nomitted. Additionally, installations typical for the launch site\nsuch as the tower, the water-cooling, or the operation of\nadditional engines (e.g. large solid boosters) are nearly\nimpossible to realize on a test stand.\n\n8.6.1.12 Turbopumps and Turbines\nThe thrust of an engine is directly proportional to the\nejected mass flow, which in turn is directly proportional to\nthe combustion chamber pressure\n\n_m \u00bc Pc ? At\nc?\n\u00bc C _m ? Pc ? At \u00f08:36\u00de\n\nwith _m the mass flow (kg/s), At the throat area (m\n2), c* the\n\ncharacteristic velocity (m/s), C _m the mass flow coefficient\n(1/s), and Pc the combustion pressure (Pa).\n\nVarious combinations of engine cycle can be considered,\nas seen previously in Fig. 8.9. The pressure fed engines are\nthe simplest, but are limited in thrust by the need for high\npressures in the tanks, leading to very heavy assemblies.\nPractically, it is difficult to have a thrust higher than 50 kN\nwith a pressure fed (or blow-down) cycle, which corresponds\nin general to a combustion chamber pressure of some\n10\u201320 bars. To reach higher thrust values, higher chamber\npressures are necessary, imposing the need for turbopumps.\n\nThe function of a turbopump is to raise the pressure of a\npropellant from the low pressure of the storage tank to the\nhigh pressure necessary for its injection into the combustion\nchamber. Turbopumps are generally rotating machines,\nalthough some manufacturers have considered piston\nmachines similar to an automobile engine (for instance\nUkrainian proposals, and XCor).\n\nThe power developed by a turbopump PP (W) can be\nvery high, often reaching several MW, depending on the\npressure increase DP (in Pa), the mass flow q (kg/s), the\nvolumic mass of the propellant q (kg/m3), and the efficiency\nof the machine gP. Typical efficiencies are in the range\n0.6\u20130.8 depending on the design of the pump.\n\nThe power of a turbopump\n\nPP \u00bc _m ?\nDP\n\nq ? gP\nP \u00f08:37\u00de\n\nis generally provided by a gas turbine, the function of which\nis to expand high enthalpy gases in a rotating machine to\nprovide mechanical power to the axis of the turbine. The\npower developed by a gas turbine PT (W) is a function of\nthe gas mass flow _m (kg/s), the thermal capacity of gas CP\n(J/kg.K), the isentropic temperature TIsos (K), and the effi-\nciency of the turbine gT. Typical efficiencies are in the range\n0.45\u20130.7 depending on the design of the turbine.\n\nThe power of a turbine driving a turbopump\n\nPT \u00bc _m:CP ? DTIsos ? gT \u00f08:38\u00de\n\nhas to be transferred from the axis of the turbine to the axis\nof the pump. Numerous schemes are conceivable, depend-\ning on the number of turbines (one per pump, or one driving\ntwo pumps) and the respective rotation velocities of the\nvarious machines, these being mainly dependent on the\ndensity of the propellants.\n\nA major difficulty to solve with turbopumps is the risk of\ncavitation. In order to function correctly, the inlet pressure of a\npump must be high enough to avoid the creation of gaseous\n\n186 C. Bonnal et al.\n\n\n\nbubbles whose presence can damage the blades of the pump.\nDefine the net positive suction pressure (NPSP) of a pump (Pa)\nas the difference between the total inlet pressure Pt\u2014which\nis itself the sum of the static pressure PS and the dynamic\npressure Pd\u2014and the vapour pressure of the fluid Pv, viz\n\nNPSP \u00bc Pt ? Pv \u00bc PS \u00fe Pd ? Pv \u00bc PS \u00fe\n1\n2\n? q ? V2 ? Pv:\n\n\u00f08:39\u00de\n\nThis NPSP has to be compared to the pressure effectively\navailable for the propellant tank, the sum of the static\npressure in the tank, the hydrostatic pressure, and the\npressure losses in the feed lines. When this pressure leads to\na negative NPSP, or in reality to values too low to operate\nthe pump safely, then cavitation may occur and potentially\ndestroy the machine. One way to avoid this phenomenon is\nto include on the pump axis a suction stage called a boost-\npump to help with the initial pressure increase. This leads to\nvery complex and costly elements, but is a necessary evil\nfor high performance liquid rocket propulsion.\n\n8.6.2 Solid Propulsion\n\nThe use of black powder to propel a small incendiary rocket\nor firework was discovered by Chinese alchemists at the end\nof the first millennium. The first description of a weapon\ndate to around 1045 (\u2018blazing arrow\u2019); this knowledge\nmigrated from China to India, then to Arab countries and\nthen to Europe where it was used many times. For example,\nby the Arabs in 1095 in Antioch, an ancient city on the\neastern side of the Orontes River, while Joan of Arc\n(1412\u20131431) defended Orleans in 1428 using rockets. In\n1660, Blaise Pascal (1623\u20131662) explained and formulated\nthe principle of rocket propulsion.\n\nThe 19th century is considered the first golden age for\nsolid rockets: in England, under the leadership of Sir Wil-\nliam Congreve, 2nd Baronet (1772\u20131828), military rockets\nwere improved using the technologies developed for fire-\nworks and were widely used in battle. During this period,\nprogress in the chemistry of energetic materials also\nbrought the invention of the so-called \u2018smokeless powder\u2019,\nbased on nitrocellulose, by Paul Vieille (1854\u20131934), while\nin the same years Alfred Nobel (1833\u20131896) obtained the\nfirst \u2018double base\u2019 propellant based on a mixture of nitro-\nglycerine and nitrocellulose. Further progress has been\nmade since then on double base propellant formulations,\ncurrently used for instance in tactical missiles. Before the\nSecond World War, solid rocket motors were based on\nextruded double base propellants and a metallic case, but\nthe caliber was limited and the grain shapes were simple.\nDuring the Second World War, a new type of solid\n\npropellant, called \u2018composite\u2019 propellant was first used for\nJATO (Jet Assisted Take-Off) rockets, and later improved at\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory through the introduction of a\npolyurethane binder. Composite propellants have rapidly\nbecome widespread, and today represent the baseline pro-\npellant of many solid rocket motors used for launcher\napplications.\n\nModern civilian solid motors consist of a filament wound\ncase containing an aluminized hydroxy terminated polybu-\ntadiene (HTPB) composite propellant grain and a movable\nnozzle with a flex seal. Solid propulsion is a cost efficient,\nmature technology for small launchers and strap-on or add-\non boosters and is further discussed in Chap. 11.\n\n8.6.2.1 Applications\nFor a launcher, the main applications are\n\n\u2022 Large solid rocket motors used in stages that provide\nmost, if not all, of the thrust for liftoff (e.g. Space Shuttle,\nAriane 5, Titan IV).\n\n\u2022 Strap-on boosters assisting the launch vehicle liftoff to\nincrease its performance (e.g. Ariane 3, Ariane 4, Delta 2,\nDelta 4, Long March).\n\n\u2022 Stages of small launch vehicles (e.g. Pegasus, Vega).\n\u2022 Small motors for stage separation.\n\nIn addition, solid rocket motors are employed in a vari-\nous other applications such as tactical missiles, strategic\nICBMs, and sounding rockets.\n\n8.6.2.2 General Description of a Solid Rocket\nMotor\n\nA solid rocket motor is basically a high pressure tank\ncontaining the mass of solid propellant, called the propel-\nlant grain, suitably shaped to produce the desired pressure\n(thrust) time history, and in such a manner as to leave an\ninternal volume, the combustion chamber, to accommodate\nthe combustion products. The internal wall of the pressure\ntank, known as the motor case, is protected from the high\nconvective and radiative heat fluxes by an internal thermal\ninsulation. The combustion occurs at the surface of the\npropellant grain and proceeds in a direction perpendicular to\nthe surface. Some parts of the propellant grain may be\ncovered by inhibitors, in order to obtain the required pres-\nsure\u2013time curve. The gases produced by the combustion\nprocess are exhausted through a nozzle at one end of the\nmotor case. The initial ignition of the propellant surface is\nobtained by way of a dedicated device, the igniter. A rup-\nture disk, designed to burst at an assigned pressure, is\nusually placed at the aft end of the motor, both to protect the\npropellant during transport and assembly operations, and to\nfacilitate the initial pressure build-up in the motor during\nthe ignition transient. Additional structural elements, such\n\n8 Launch Systems 187\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_11\n\n\nas skirts, are often included to transmit the thrust and for\nattachment purposes in multi-stage launch vehicles. A\ntypical solid rocket motor is illustrated in Fig. 11.2.\n\n8.6.2.3 Burning Rate and Internal Ballistics\nAs mentioned previously, the burning of the solid material\noccurs at the propellant surface and in a direction perpen-\ndicular to the surface itself. The rate of recession of the\npropellant surface is called the burning rate. An empirical\nrelation between the burning rate r and the chamber pres-\nsure Pc is\n\nr \u00bc a Pc\u00f0 \u00den \u00f08:40\u00de\n\nwhere a is a constant that takes into account the initial grain\ntemperature, and n is a constant known as the burning rate\npressure exponent. Values of r in solid motors for launcher\napplications are usually of the order of 1 cm/s. The burning\nrate is very sensitive to the exponent n. The relation n \\ 1\nmust hold in order to ensure a stable motor operation. On\nthe other hand, if the value of n approaches zero then the\nburning process may become unstable, possibly leading to\nthe extinguishment of the combustion. Typical values of\nn for production propellant are between 0.2 and 0.8.\n\nAn important effect is the so-called erosive burning, an\nincrease in the burning rate mainly due to a high gas flow\nvelocity (including metal or metal oxide solid particles).\nThe increased heat transfer from the combustion products to\nthe propellant grain is the dominant effect compared to the\nactual erosion of the solid propellant. Erosive burning is\nmost likely to occur at the beginning of the burn time, when\nthe internal passage is narrower and the gas velocities are\nhigher, and also towards the aft end of the motor because\nthe gas flow accelerates from the motor-head end towards\nthe nozzle. To compensate for this effect and achieve a\nuniform combustion in the axial direction, the port area, the\ncross-section area of the flow channel in a motor, is\nincreased by tapering the propellant in the flow direction.\nThe main parameter affecting erosive burning is the ratio\nbetween the port area Ap and the nozzle throat area At.\nTypical values of the initial Ap/At ratio are comprised two\nand five. Additional enhancement of the burning rate is\nobserved in vehicles with a high longitudinal acceleration or\na high rate of spin around the longitudinal axis. The effect is\nmore pronounced if the burning surface is at a high angle to\nthe acceleration vector.\n\nThe rate of production of the gaseous combustion\nproducts equals the rate of consumption of solid propellant,\nand is therefore given by\n\n_mg \u00bc qpAbr \u00f08:41\u00de\n\nwhere _mg is the gas generation rate, qP is the propellant\ndensity, and Ab is the area of the burning surface. Under\n\nsteady state operation, the gas generation rate equals the\nmass flow rate through the nozzle, expressed as\n\n_mn \u00bc C _mPcAt \u00f08:42\u00de\n\nwith C _m being the mass flow factor (inverse of c* used in\nliquid propulsion) at the nozzle throat area, At, and Pc being\nthe chamber pressure. Note that Eq. 8.42 is the same as\nEq. 8.36. Using the relationship for the burning rate, the\nchamber pressure can be determined as\n\nPc \u00bc\nAb\nAt\n\naqp\nC _m\n\nffi ?1=1?n\n: \u00f08:43\u00de\n\nThe pressure inside the motor is proportional to the\nburning area Ab. An increase (decrease) of burning area\nwith time will lead to an increase (decrease) in the motor\nchamber pressure (and thrust). As observed, the higher the\nvalue of n, the greater is the sensitivity of the chamber\npressure to small variations in burning surface. The varia-\ntion of Ab with time depends on both the burning rate and\nthe initial geometry of the propellant grain. This initial\nshape determines the pressure (thrust) history. That is a\nprogressive, neutral, or regressive burning is attained\ndepending on whether the pressure (thrust) increases,\nremains constant, or decreases with time; see also Chap. 11\nand specifically Fig. 11.3. In practical applications, the\npressure\u2013time curve is shaped to take into account the\nperformance requirements and constraints of the launcher\nsystem, such as reduced thrust during the transonic phase,\nmaximum dynamic pressure, maximum acceleration, con-\ntrollability during thrust tail-off, and so forth. A typical\ncurve for the Ariane 5 booster is shown in Fig. 8.13.\n\n8.6.2.4 Motor Case and Thermal Protection\nThe motor case represents the structural element of a solid\nrocket motor. Its design is mainly driven by the requirement\nto support the motor internal pressure (the MEOP: maxi-\nmum expected operating pressure), but it must also satisfy\nother requirements of the launcher system, such as thrust\ntransmission, general vehicle loads, thrust vector control,\nmotor handling, and so forth. The bare motor case design\nand manufacturing technologies have significantly pro-\ngressed in recent years. Two main approaches are typically\napplied\n\n\u2022 Metallic motor case: currently adopted for large seg-\nmented solid rocket motors. Each segment may be\nformed by several cylinders made of steel joined together\neither by using clevis-tang connections or by welding.\nThe cylinders are manufactured at the desired diameter\nand length using flow-forming techniques, are then usu-\nally given a heat treatment (such as quench and temper),\nand finally the ends are machined to obtain the inter-\n\n188 C. Bonnal et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_11\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_11\n\n\nsegment joints. The forward and aft domes are forged,\nand include suitable openings for connecting the igniter\nand the nozzle, respectively.\n\n\u2022 Composite motor case: used for monolithic solid rocket\nmotors. Motors as large as 3 m in diameter and as long as\n10 m can be obtained. The composite case is obtained by\nfilament winding (mainly carbon) impregnated by an\nepoxy resin, serving as a plastic matrix. The filament\nwinding deposits filament bands around a mandrel having\nthe final motor case internal diameter. The fibers are\noriented along the direction of the principal stresses,\nusing two or more winding angles.\n\nThe internal thermal protection has the function of pro-\ntecting the bare motor case from the high convective and\nradiative heat fluxes to which it would be exposed after the\nfull propellant consumption (at a given axial location), in\norder to maintain the temperature of the metallic or com-\nposite structure at an acceptable level. The thermal pro-\ntection is usually made of a synthetic rubber filled with\nsilica, Kevlar, glass, or microspheres. Under the effect of\nthe high thermal fluxes, a pyrolysis of the layer of the\nthermal protection closer to the hot gases results in ablation\nof the pyrolyzed layer by the mechanical erosion of the gas\nflow. The design of the thermal protection (i.e. the variation\nof its thickness with the axial position) depends on the\nthermo-physical properties of the chosen material, the\ntemperature of the gases inside the motor chamber, and the\nduration of exposure.\n\nFor metallic cases, the internal thermal protection is put\nin place through dedicated winding machines on the inner\nsurface of the bare motor case, suitably prepared by sand-\ning, degreasing, etc., and then subjected to a heat treatment\nin an autoclave to achieve vulcanization of the rubber in\norder to bond it to the motor case. In segmented motors, the\nfront of each propellant segment may be thermally\n\ninsulated, and hence not participate in the combustion, so as\nto achieve the combustion surface associated with the\ndesired thrust law. For composite cases, the thermal pro-\ntection is wound on the mandrel, then treated in the auto-\nclave either separately or at the same time as the curing of\nthe composite material.\n\n8.6.2.5 Propellant Grain\nA solid propellant includes all the necessary ingredients for\ncombustion. No external oxygen is needed. The propellant\nprovides through its combustion the gas flow rate required\nfor propulsion. The main properties that characterize a solid\npropellant are its performance and internal ballistic prop-\nerties (specific impulse, density, burning rate, burning rate\nexponent, burning rate sensitivity to temperature), the\nmechanical properties required in order to sustain the\npressure and shear loads as well as temperature changes, its\nstorage capability (also referred to as shelf life), hazard\nproperties, handling and transport characteristics, produc-\ntion properties, and material costs.\n\nSolid propellants are classically divided into three main\ncategories. Double base propellants, in which the fuel and\noxidizer are contained in the same molecule, are typically\nbased on nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. Composite pro-\npellants are composed of separate elements: a solid fuel, a\nsolid oxidizer, and a polymeric matrix serving as a binder.\nComposite modified double base propellants are double\nbase propellants enhanced by such ingredients as ammo-\nnium perchlorate, aluminum, Research Department Explo-\nsive (RDX, also called cyclonite, hexogen, or T4; chemical\nname cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine or 1,3,5-trinitroperhy-\ndro-1,3,5-triazine), or HMX (origin of compound name\nunclear but also known as cyclotetramethylene-tetranitr-\namine, tetrahexamine tetranitramine, or octahydro-1,3,5,7-\ntetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine).\n\nT\nh\n\nru\nst\n\n (\nN\n\n)\n\nTime (s)\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n7000\n\n10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140\n\nStage\nSeparation\n\nMaximum Thrust\n\nAverage Thrust\n\nFig. 8.13 Typical Ariane 5 solid\npropellant motor (MPS) booster\nthrust-time curve\n\n8 Launch Systems 189\n\n\n\nOperational solid rocket motors for launcher applications\nuse composite propellants with ammonium perchlorate as\noxidizer and aluminum as fuel because only this type of\npropellant is able to satisfy modern hazard regulation\nrequired (i.e. class 1.3).\n\nWithin a composite propellant, the oxidizer contains the\noxygen necessary for the combustion of the fuel. Desired\nproperties are: high density, high oxygen balance, a heat of\nformation as negative as possible, good thermal stability,\nand low impact sensitivity. Different sizes of oxidizer par-\nticle are often used in a single propellant mix, usually with\nboth fine and coarse particles (e.g. 10 and 200 lm), so as to\ninclude in the propellant a high amount of oxidizer. The\nparticle size distribution, and indeed the particle shape have\nimportant effects on the internal ballistic performance, and\nsometimes may affect such phenomena as pressure oscil-\nlations. The most conventional oxidizer is ammonium per-\nchlorate but ammonium nitrate is also used in some\napplications and more advanced oxidizers include RDX,\nHMX, CL-20 (hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane, or HNIW),\nammonium dinitramide (AND) and hydrazinium nitrofor-\nmate (HNF). The fuel is usually represented by aluminum\nparticles (20\u201350 lm) in order to provide high density and\nspecific impulse. Other possible fuels such as boron,\nberyllium, or lithium have limited applications, mainly due\nto their poor burning characteristics, toxicity, and difficul-\nties in manufacturing. The oxidizer and fuel particles are\nembedded in the binder, which ensures the cohesion of the\ncured propellant. The binder participates in the combustion\nas a fuel. The main criteria for the choice of a binder are\ngood mechanical properties, good compatibility with other\ningredients, satisfactory casting characteristics (low vis-\ncosity and slow cross-linking), rapid curing, and good aging\ncharacteristics. Binders are typically based on polybutadi-\nenes (PB) and the three main types are polybutadiene-\nacrylic acid acrylonitrite (PBAN), carboxy-terminated\npolybutadiene (CBAN) and hydroxil-terminated polybuta-\ndiene (HTPB). Current civilian solid rocket motors use\nHTPB. Advanced, energetic binders are PolyNimmo, Po-\nlyGlyn, GAP, and BAMO.\n\nSeveral additives are usually included in a propellant\nformulation. The main additives include catalysts for\nmodifying (increasing or decreasing) the burning rate,\nchemical ingredients to modify the burning rate exponent,\ncross-linking agents, plasticizers for improved mechanical\nproperties, stabilizers, and so forth.\n\nThe propellant grain is the ensemble of the solid pro-\npellant itself. The initial shape of the propellant grain is a\nvery important aspect of designing the pressure (thrust)\nhistory of the motor; see Fig. 11.3. Many different shapes\nhave been conceived, but the most frequently used for\nlaunch vehicles are\n\na. Cylindrical grain, having a constant (usually circular)\ncross-section along the motor axis. It provides progres-\nsive burning.\n\nb. Conical grain, or sometimes a conocyl (i.e. the combi-\nnation of a conical and a cylindrical part). It makes the\nburning closer to neutral.\n\nc. Slotted tube (fins), having a star-shaped cross-section. It\nprovides a regressive burning, and is often used to make\navailable a large burning surface at motor ignition and\nduring early operation.\n\nd. Finocyl configuration, the grain having a star-shape in\none part (either at the motor\u2019s head-end or aft-end) and\nbeing cylindrical in the other part. It combines the\nadvantages of both the pure cylindrical grain and the\nstar-shaped grain.\n\ne. End burning grain, which burns in the axial direction\nonly on one side surface of the grain. It has a neutral\nburning, but is no longer in use for practical applications\nin launch vehicles.\n\nThe propellant grain has to withstand several loads\nduring its life: pressure loads (in particular during the\nignition transient), mechanical loads (both gravity and\naccelerations), thermal loads during cool-down after curing\n(propellant shrinkage), thermal cycling during handling,\ntransportation and storage, and dynamic loads during motor\ntransportation and functioning (vibrations, shocks and\nacoustic noise). The propellant is a visco-elastic material\nwhose mechanical behavior is time dependent, having the\ncapability to accumulate damage from different load sour-\nces or repeated load conditions. The mechanical properties\nof the propellant grain (Young\u2019s modulus, stress, and strain)\nare usually plotted versus time for different values of tem-\nperature and strain rate. Laboratory analysis of the propel-\nlant strength is usually done using uniaxial loading tests,\nand in some cases with biaxial loading tests. The structural\nanalysis of the grain (including the liner, thermal protection,\nand motor case) is performed using finite element method\ncalculations, with the goal of verifying that acceptable\nmargins of safety are attained. As the propellant is case\nbonded, special attention has to be given to areas such as the\nbond line or the grain ends, where high stress concentrations\nmay occur. Floaters are applied at these propellant-case\ninterfaces in order to compensate for stresses induced dur-\ning propellant shrinkage (primarily different thermal\nexpansion coefficients of the case material and the propel-\nlant) and by the pressure loads during motor ignition.\n\nPropellant grain manufacturing involves complex pro-\ncesses that are performed under strict safety measures in\norder to prevent explosion or fire. The manufacturing pro-\ncess depends on the type of propellant and on the motor size\nbecause there is no single standard process. Composite\npropellant preparation is usually based on a batch process,\n\n190 C. Bonnal et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_11\n\n\nalthough a continuous-flow process also exists. Batches\nwith the polymer and the fuel particles, together with any\nburning rate catalyst and plasticizers are prepared, and as it\nundergoes a mixing process to make it homogeneous the\noxidizer is introduced. Several batches can be prepared, in\nwhich the mixture (pre-mix) remains in liquid state. Then\nthe curing agents are added and a final mixing is performed.\nThe propellant is poured into the protected motor case and\nplaced in the casting pit. A mandrel is introduced inside the\nmotor in order to achieve the final motor internal perfora-\ntion, suitably shaped (cylindrical, star, etc.). The propellant\nhardens during the curing phase over a period of several\ndays, performed typically at around 50 ?C. Once curing is\ncompleted, the mandrel is carefully removed, leaving the\npropellant bonded to the internal thermal protection through\na liner. The liner is made of a material based on the same\npolymer as that of the propellant to ensure good compati-\nbility, and is applied through a process of spray deposition\nin order to control its thickness.\n\nIt is essential to avoid cracks, voids and any type of flaw\nin the propellant that would cause off-nominal propellant\nburning and motor functioning, in some cases possibly\nleading to catastrophic failure. Several techniques are\nemployed to this end, including the application of vacuum\nand temperature control during mixing and casting, vibra-\ntion (and sometimes spinning) of the motor case during\ncasting, and slight motor pressurization after casting in\norder to remove air bubbles. Finally, non-destructive\ninspection techniques, typically X-rays and ultra-sound, are\nemployed to ensure propellant and motor integrity. After\nthese controls, the loaded motor case can be completed with\nthe integration of the nozzle and the igniter.\n\n8.6.2.6 Igniter\nThe igniter\u2019s function is to ensure the proper ignition of\nthe propellant. Several types of igniter exist, but the most\nwidely used is the so-called pyrotechnic igniter assembly.\nIt usually consists of a two or three igniters operating in a\nchain to generate at each stage an increasing mass flow of\nhot gases until reaching a mass flow level sufficient to\nreach the ignition conditions in the propellant grain. As an\nexample, the first stage of the chain is always a pyro-\ntechnic igniter consisting of pellets (usually containing\nboron, potassium, or magnesium), mounted inside an\nintermediate igniter, which in turn is placed inside the\nmain igniter. Each igniter of the chain may contain several\nnozzles, canted at a predetermined angle with respect to\nthe motor axis in order to ease ignition. The pyrotechnic\nigniter is started by an initiator, the IFOC (Inflammateur \u00e0\nFonctionnement par Onde de Choc; Detonation to Defla-\ngration Initiator), also known as a squib or primer,\ndelivering the initial energy upon receipt of an electric\nsignal. The whole igniter assembly is placed on the motor-\n\nhead end dome through a bolted flange. A safe and arm\ndevice is frequently used to prevent inadvertent motor\nignition.\n\nMotor ignition is a very rapid process, typically com-\npleted in less than 0.2 s. The ignition transient is conven-\ntionally subdivided into three phases: the ignition time lag,\nthat is the time from the initial IFOC signal to the first\nignition of a point in the motor propellant grain; the flame\nspreading interval, that is the time from first ignition of the\npropellant grain to the full ignition of its burning surface;\nand the chamber filling interval, that is the time for filling\nthe combustion chamber with hot gases, during which the\nchamber pressure increases until attaining an equilibrium\nvalue. The ignition transient is a critical phase in a motor\u2019s\noperation: a pressure peak above the equilibrium chamber\npressure may occur in some rocket motor designs during the\nchamber filling interval. Also, in launch vehicles with two\nor more boosters, the ignition of the boosters must occur\nsimultaneously, with only a very small difference in ignition\ntransient duration being allowed in order to avoid thrust\nimbalances. The problem of thrust imbalance during the\nentire motor operation is an important issue to be taken into\naccount during the motor design phase, with the goal being\nto achieve good motor reproducibility and ensure the cor-\nrect flight of the launcher.\n\n8.6.2.7 Nozzle\nThe task of the nozzle is to evacuate the combustion gases\nand to generate the thrust. It is attached to the rear dome of\nthe motor case. The classical design consists of a submerged\nnozzle with a conical divergent section, and it can be either\nfixed or movable. In this latter case, it can be orientated\nthrough a flexible bearing to allow the thrust vector to be\ndirected (deflection angles are usually up to 6? or 8?). The\nnozzle is designed to support the loads resulting from the\nhigh temperature and pressure of the combustion gases and\nby the nozzle gimballing.\n\nThe nozzle consists of a divergent assembly, with a metal\npart (in aluminum or steel) to support the mechanical loads,\nand a thermal protection made of either carbon phenolic or\nsilica phenolic to provide the thermal barrier. The thermal\nprotection is usually glued to the metallic casing. The\ndivergent structure may be made of filament reinforced\nplastic in some applications. The nozzle throat (usually a\nthroat insert) is made either of C/C or graphite. The nozzle\nnose forming the convergent section and nose cap is also\nmade of carbon phenolic. The flexible bearing (or flex seal) is\na sandwich of shims (metallic or glass epoxy composite) with\nrubber pads, having a spherical shape in order to allow\nrotation by introducing shear displacement in the pads. A low\nmodulus rubber is usually employed for the pads, in order to\ndecrease the torque and therefore the power required by the\n\n8 Launch Systems 191\n\n\n\nthrust vector control (TVC) system for nozzle actuation. The\nflex seal is protected by a membrane.\n\nAn important effect during motor operation is the erosion\nof the nozzle throat due to a combination of oxidation of the\ncarbon at high temperatures, and the rapid flow of aluminized\ngases. This erosion increases the throat diameter and thus\nalters the motor performance. It is therefore very important to\nuse low erosion materials for the nozzle insert. The correct\nestimation of the nozzle throat erosion is essential for the\ngood design and operation of the nozzle. The best materials\nare Pyro-Graphite or high density C/C. A movable nozzle\nincludes the necessary connection (usually made of steel)\nwith the thrust vector control system for swiveling the nozzle.\n\n8.6.2.8 Pressure Oscillations\nPressure oscillations inside the combustion chamber are\nobserved in some solid rocket motors, prevalently in large\nboosters such as the Space Shuttle\u2019s SRM, the Titan SRMU,\nand the Ariane 5 SRM. Although they rarely lead to cata-\nstrophic motor failure, these pressure oscillations translate into\nthrust oscillations (through the response of the motor struc-\ntures) that may affect motor performance and produce high\nvibration loads on the vehicle structures and on the payload.\n\nThere are two main types of pressure oscillations phenomena\n\n\u2022 Oscillations that sustain themselves through energy cou-\npling with the unsteady combustion process. Given that the\nburning rate is influenced by the combustion pressure and\nflow velocity, oscillations in pressure (flow velocity) can\ninteract with the propellant combustion energy release in a\nmanner that produces self-sustained pressure oscillations.\n\n\u2022 Oscillations sustained by unsteady hydrodynamic phe-\nnomena. In particular, the formation and shedding of\nvortices within the combustion chamber is responsible for\ndriving pressure oscillations, when the shedding fre-\nquency is close to one of the main acoustic frequencies of\nthe combustion chamber. The vortex shedding may be\ngenerated by inhibitor rings that protrude into the main\nchamber flow during propellant combustion, or by a\nrearward facing step in the propellant grain, or even by\nthe unstable transition of the velocity boundary layer\nalong the burning propellant surface.\n\nIn both types of pressure oscillation, the acoustical\ndamping is mainly due to the nozzle, viscous flow effects,\nand particulate damping.\n\nDespite the significant progress made in understanding\nthe physical phenomena, and in the associated modeling,\ncombustion instabilities and pressure oscillations in solid\nrocket motors continue to be an important issue in the\ndesign and operation of a motor. A complete knowledge of\nthe physical processes is still lacking; as a matter of fact, it\n\nhas been sometimes observed that even a small variation in\none of the motor parameters can have a large, unexpected\nimpact on pressure oscillations. Work is continuing to\nimprove understanding of the main parameters affecting\npressure oscillations, to enhance validated simulation tools\nand provide reliable estimations not only of the oscillation\nfrequencies but also of the oscillation amplitudes. This will\nmake available flexible test motors at an intermediate scale\nthat are, sufficiently representative of the involved phe-\nnomena to preclude the need to construct and operate full-\nscale solid motors.\n\n8.7 Launcher Avionics and Software\n\nAvionics and software are obviously fundamental in the\noperation of a launcher, both during the ground phase and in\nflight. The main requirements applicable to launcher avi-\nonics and software are\n\n\u2022 Implementation of the guidance, navigation, and control\nfunctions. This subsystem must trigger the propulsion,\nguide the launcher throughout the flight, control the\nlauncher during all phases, jettison the stages and fairing,\ncontrol the payload attitudes for orbit injection and safely\ndeploy them, and perform the end of life actions.\n\n\u2022 Implementation of the stages. This subsystem must take\ncare of engine ignition/shutdown, and perform operational\nmonitoring of the propulsion system, and the pressuriza-\ntion and propellant levels of the tanks. It also participates\nin the thermal control functions of the stages, and com-\nmands their passivation at the end of the mission.\n\n\u2022 Avionics and software is in charge of the neutralization\nfunction.\n\nThe avionics and software subsystem must also integrate\nnumerous constraints\n\n\u2022 It must tolerate the natural and launcher-induced envi-\nronments: namely this dynamic environment (sinusoidal\nvibrations, random vibrations, shock, transport), the local\nambient environment in terms of temperature and\nhumidity, and the effects of pressure/depressurisation,\nand the natural radiation environment (protons, heavy\nions, etc.).\n\n\u2022 It must cope with product assurance requirements: in\nparticular, safety constraints that can be either qualitative,\nsuch as fail-safe/fail-safe (FS/FS) concepts, or quantita-\ntive with probabilities of success. The reliability\nrequirements of the mission often dictate the level of\nredundancy, and the availability constraints influence the\ntechnological choices.\n\n192 C. Bonnal et al.\n\n\n\nThe overall architecture of the avionics subsystem varies\nfrom one launcher to another. It is often centralized in a\ndedicated avionics bay, with a limited amount of equipment\ndistributed along the launcher, near the elements they are\nserving. Some equipment may also be located on lower\nstages depending on the mission profile, for example, when\nthey cease to function early in the flight.\n\nThe electrical equipment is often structured around a data\nbus, with norms such as MIL-STD-1553B; see Chap. 15.\nA typical architecture is presented in Fig. 8.14.\n\n8.7.1 Launcher Electrical Power\n\nThe purpose of the electrical power subsystem is to supply\nthe necessary power at a roughly constant voltage, satisfy-\ning the need for high power when required and enabling\nground to on-board switching.\n\nThe subsystem\u2019s architecture includes various electro-\nchemical power sources and terminal equipment connected\nto sources via appropriate distribution equipment (power\ndistribution unit, safety unit).\n\nPower sources consist of primary sources, which are\nnon-rechargeable voltaic-cell batteries, and secondary\nsources, which are rechargeable accumulator batteries.\nThree types of electro-chemical combinations are used:\nnickel\u2013cadmium is a low cost, proven technology; silver-\nzinc is an attractive specific power and energy source, and\nlithium-based combinations yield a high level of specific\nenergy. More details can be found in Chap. 10.\n\n8.7.2 Safety, Telecommand\n\nThe safety function aims to protect personnel at the launch\nbase, and populations of the overflown territories in the\n\nevent of a problem that could lead to a critical failure such\nas a trajectory deviation. In this case, a neutralization order\ncan either be sent from the ground, elaborated by the\nlauncher on loss of stage integrity, or by the on-board\nsoftware algorithms. Neutralization is achieved by frag-\nmenting the launcher, or by simply cutting the propulsion in\norder to drop it into a safe zone.\n\nThe safety subsystem fulfills three vital functions:\nautomatic and instantaneous destruction or engine shutdown\nin accordance with on-board criteria; destruction or engine\nshutdown, on reception of a command from ground control;\nand automatic delayed destruction after a nominal separa-\ntion in order to avoid leaving floating wreckage.\n\nThe equipment necessary to perform these functions\nusually includes\n\n\u2022 A dedicated battery to provide electrical power.\n\u2022 A safety unit for distributing power (including ground to\n\non-board switching), dealing with the separation mecha-\nnisms, processing the orders for destruction, and actuat-\ning the devices that perform the destruction.\n\n\u2022 A radar transponder, with several aerials for trajectory\ndetermination.\n\n\u2022 A destruction telecommand receiver, with its own set of\naerials.\n\n8.7.3 Flight Control\n\nThe flight control subsystem is in charge of performing all\nthe guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) activities\npreviously identified. These functions are detailed in gen-\neral form in Chap. 12, but includes dedicated sensors,\namong which are the inertial measurement unit (IMU), the\ngyrometric block (BGY) and other measurements used to\ngenerate the inputs to the GNC loop.\n\nMaster\nOn-Board Computer\n\nBackup\nOn-Board Computer\n\nProper-functioning signal\n\nNominal equipment i\n\nNominal equipment j\n\nBackup equipment i\n\nBackup equipment j\n\nBus 1 -1553\n\nBus 2 -1553\n\nto lower stages to lower stages\n\nFig. 8.14 Typical data flow\narchitecture of launcher avionics\nequipment\n\n8 Launch Systems 193\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_15\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_12\n\n\n\u2022 The aim of the three-axis IMU is to provide attitude angles\nand cumulated accelerations. It is often strapped down,\nbased on three-axis gyrolasers and pendular accelerometers.\n\n\u2022 The BGY is used, when necessary, to provide angular\nvelocities in yaw and pitch for the control of some of the low\nfrequency modes. It can be based on fiber optic technologies.\n\n\u2022 A dedicated functional unit acquires such pressures,\ntemperatures, propellant and pressurant levels, and other\nsensors used in the operational algorithms.\n\nThe outputs are the orders that are sent to the engine\nactuators and to the servo-control mechanisms that operate\nthe flight controls, including the attitude control system. It\nalso issues the sequential commands to advance the\nlauncher through its various transitory phases. These func-\ntions are performed within the on-board computer.\n\n8.7.4 Telemetry\n\nThe function of the telemetry subsystem is the acquisition\nand processing of all the on-board flight measurements, their\nconditioning, their monitoring, and all activities in prepara-\ntion for transmission to ground stations: data recording and\nretrieval, formatting, modulation and transmission through\naerials located on the external surface of the launch vehicle.\n\n8.8 Future\n\n8.8.1 Systems\n\nThe future of space launch systems will be dominated by\nthe evolution of existing systems. Expendable multi-stage\nrocket propelled launch vehicles are well suited to currently\nenvisioned transportation demands. There are, however,\nopportunities that might lead to a so-called rupture or\nbreakthrough revolution, or at least an accelerated\nevolution.\n\n\u2022 Technology evolution (high-energy density propellants,\nnanotube structures, etc.).\n\n\u2022 An essential increase of institutional and/or commercial\nspace launch demand (detection of and defence against\nnatural and human-induced hazards, orbital tourism, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Suborbital tourism launch systems and related operation\nexperience allowing for an efficient entry into reusable\norbital launch systems.\n\nThe evolution of present systems will mainly be influ-\nenced by\n\n\u2022 The demand for launcher evolution and the related size,\nmass, and other features of payloads.\n\n\u2022 Institutional budgets for technology improvement, dem-\nonstration, and system development.\n\n\u2022 International cooperation.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the overall goal of reliability,\nefficiency, and finally cost improvement is intrinsic for the\ninvolved industry.\n\nWith the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, sys-\ntems for human space launch will stay even closer to the\nexisting launch systems. The human \u2018payload\u2019 requires a\nspecific compartment or capsule to provide life support\nduring the entire mission, including reentry. Delta qualifi-\ncation and additional emergency rescue systems should\nallow most of the current mid-to-heavy payload launch\nsystems to be upgraded to human-rated systems as and\nwhen required.\n\n8.8.2 Research and Technology\n\nInstitutional technology programs and industry research\nand technology funding are the major sources for tech-\nnology evolution. Due to the specific constraints for\nspace launch systems, technology spin-in and spin-off\nhas been and will remain limited to basics and compo-\nnents. Due to the importance and complexity, a major\neffort will have to be concentrated on the propulsion\nsubsystem and related components without missing a\nbalanced evolution of all related technologies. Some\nobvious focal points can be identified, but should always\nbe oriented towards a concrete system development and\nrelated requirements: high energy density chemical pro-\npulsion, chemical (cryogenic) liquid propellant rocket\nengines reusability, lightweight structures for low and\nhigh temperature, and health monitoring for components\nand systems.\n\n8.8.3 Demonstrators\n\nNew technologies and system configurations, or entirely\nnew systems, present additional risks of failure. Demon-\nstration or qualification flights are the essential measure of\nrisk mitigation prior to entering the operational phase.\nDepending on the leap in technology and the system con-\nfiguration, there might be the need for specific (mostly\nsubscale) demonstration vehicles. There are some focal\npoints in technology and system configuration evolution for\nfuture and advanced space launch systems crying out for\nspecific demonstration vehicles and missions: high speed\n\n194 C. Bonnal et al.\n\n\n\n([Mach 3) atmospheric flight (ascent and reentry), appli-\ncation of air-breathing propulsion, and application of\ntethers.\n\nOf course, in-flight demonstrations should only be\napplied in cases where on-ground demonstration is either\nnot (efficiently) possible or not sufficiently representative of\nenvironmental conditions. Even then, budget constraints\nwill often prevent the efficient use of demonstration\nopportunities within the development of future space launch\nsystems.\n\n8.8.4 Advanced Concepts\n\nAdvanced concepts for space launch systems include a wide\nvariety of options and ideas that are driven by the following\nparameters\n\n\u2022 Part or full reusability (e.g. for a multiplicity of missions\nexpendable upper stages are necessary).\n\n\u2022 Number of stages.\n\u2022 Launch and landing method (horizontal, vertical, with/\n\nwithout propulsion, lifting body or winged).\n\u2022 Propulsion (rocket, air-breathing propulsion,\n\ncombinations).\n\nExperience gained from 30 years of Space Shuttle oper-\nation and a great many national and international technology\nand demonstration programs has provided an essential\nunderstanding of the evolution opportunities for and the\nconstraints imposed upon advanced concepts. That is\n\n\u2022 Single-stage vehicles will only become feasible after\nessential progress in propulsion and structures\ntechnologies.\n\n\u2022 Reuse of first or boost stages leads to limited cost savings\nthat do not justify the development, infrastructure, and\noperational expenditure.\n\n\u2022 High-speed air-breathing propulsion is very complex and\nits integration will lead to even more complex system\nconfigurations for which an enormous demonstration and\ndevelopment effort will be necessary.\n\n\u2022 Horizontal unpowered landing with wings is the least-\neffort solution for the return of large rocket stages.\n\nThe analysis of advanced concepts is done mainly by\nnumerical simulation. The necessary software tools should\nrepresent the available knowledge, and therefore integrate\nknowledge from a variety of typically geographically dis-\npersed specialists via a network. NASA has reached a very\nhigh level of simulation and optimization tools. Maintaining\nthis level and stepwise improvement and verification of the\nsimulation algorithms might also be a challenge for the future.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n1.

Henriksen\n\n9.1 Space Vehicle Structures\n\nStructural elements form the backbone of a spacecraft. They\nprovide the overall mechanical integrity of the spacecraft\nunder launch and in-orbit loads. Furthermore, the structure\nensures that the spacecraft configuration is maintained\nduring all mission phases, ensuring the relative alignment of\ncomponents like antennas, reflectors, sensors and optical\ninstruments. In the latter cases, the potential loss of\ndimensional stability of the spacecraft structure can\nseverely degrade the mission performances.\n\nSpacecraft structures typically consist of the following\nstructural elements: shells of revolution (e.g. cylinders and\ncones tube), \u2018sandwich\u2019 panels (e.g. equipment and instru-\nment platforms), rings, bars, and trusses. An exploded view\nof a typical spacecraft structure is illustrated in Fig. 9.1.\n\nThe spacecraft structural architecture is driven by the\nspacecraft attitude control requirements. Spin-stabilized\nspacecraft have a rotationally symmetric structure, whereas\nring-type equipment platforms are arranged around a central\ncone or cylinder. Three-axis stabilized spacecraft are usu-\nally a box-type structure with large external panels pro-\nviding sufficient space for the accommodation of\ninstrumentation, antennas and a central tube load-carrying\nstructure with flat sandwich panels attached.\n\nSpacecraft structures are typically divided into primary\nand secondary structures. The primary structure defines the\nmain load path down to the base of the spacecraft where\nthe spacecraft interfaces connect with the launch vehicle.\nThe primary structure determines whether the mechanical\ndesign is compliant with the mechanical requirements of the\nlauncher, such as the minimum natural frequency (stiffness)\n\nrequirement and quasi-static load cases (strength). Typical\nprimary structure design components are thrust tubes\n(cylinder, cone), the launch vehicle interface ring, sandwich\npanels and struts to support the panels, tanks, and other\nspacecraft equipment.\n\nThe secondary structure provides mounting provisions\nfor the payload, units, solar arrays, antennas, etc. It transfers\nload to the primary structure. Typical secondary structure\ncomponents are sandwich panels. Attached to the spacecraft\nare deployable flexible appendages such as antenna reflec-\ntors and solar panels.\n\nDue to launcher and mission constraints, spacecraft mass\nis a key design parameter in the design of all spacecraft. The\nmass of a spacecraft structure will typically not exceed\n10\u201315 % of the spacecraft dry mass [1\u20133].\n\nMaterial selection is important in the design of a\nspacecraft structure. For example, high specific strength and\nstiffness can be important material performance parameters\nin achieving strength and stiffness requirements in a light-\nweight design; however, the material parameters will be a\nfunction of the failure mechanism being considered, as such\na range of efficiency parameters can be defined. Composite\nmaterial have high specific strength and stiffness properties\nand therefore are candidate materials for spacecraft struc-\nture applications. They possess more favorable stiffness-to-\nweight ratios than the conventional metallic materials (e.g.\naluminum alloys). Furthermore, composite structure per-\nformance can be tailored to specific needs by choosing the\nstructure layup accordingly; for example, by embedding\nhigh strength or stiffness carbon fibers, depending upon\nwhether strength or stiffness requirements drive the design.\n\nWhere high dimensional stability under thermal loads is\ndemanded, composite structures are superior to metallic\nstructures due to their very small coefficients of thermal\nexpansion (CTE), which might even become negative\ndepending on the laminate layup. An additional means of\nachieving dimensional stability is the use of ceramics,\nwhich can be used for, say, optical benches or for telescope\n\nG. Miglioreno (&) ? T. K.

Typical examples have been implemented in the\nHerschel-Planck Telescopes (see Fig. 9.2) and the Near-\nInfrared Spectrometer for James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST) SiC100 optical bench (Fig. 9.3).\n\nAn important spacecraft structural subsystem is the\nseparation system used to attach and separate the spacecraft\nto and from the launch vehicle, for example, by means of a\nclamp band. The main requirements the clamp band include\nwithstanding the bending moment, running loads, and shear\n\nloads during launch. In addition, the loads of the vibration\ntests on the ground and the transportation loads for the other\nspecific separation systems used during the spacecraft\ndevelopment must also be endured. The clamp band must\nalso ensure that the separation between the spacecraft and\nthe launch vehicle occurs at the required separation velocity\n(0.5 m/s is used for most launch vehicles) and in the\nrequired attitude domains for the spacecraft and the last\nstage of the launcher. Finally, the clamp band should ensure\n\nFig. 9.2 Herschel Telescope.\nImage EADS Astrium\n\nFig. 9.1 Exploded view of\nspacecraft structure showing\nbase/interface ring\n\n198 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\na separation without debris and pollution in order to con-\nform with any spacecraft cleanliness specifications. Sepa-\nration is accomplished by actuating several bolt cutters to\nrelease the band so that torsion and pushers springs can\npush aside the clamps and ensure separation between the\nspacecraft and the launcher.\n\nThe major design/mission structural requirements for a\nspacecraft structure are discussed in detail in Sect. 9.2 of this\nchapter. Most of the spacecraft mechanical design require-\nments are specified in the launch vehicle user\u2019s manual.\n\n9.1.1 Crewed Space Vehicles\n\nWhen a human crew is part of a space mission, their safety\nbecomes one of the main objectives of the mission itself.\nTherefore, for crewed spacecraft, safety requirements drive\nmost of the spacecraft design.\n\nOf course, the structure of a crewed spacecraft is one of\nthe subsystems that are heavily involved in protecting the\nlife of the crew, because of its functions of isolation, pro-\ntection and support of vital equipment. A failure of the\ncrewed vehicle structures will most likely result in a cata-\nstrophic failure leading to permanent injury or loss of life.\n\nA crewed space structure is designed to fulfill various\nfunctions. The basic one is to protect the habitable crew\nenvironment from outer space. Additionally the structure is\ndesigned to provide and maintain a \u2018shirt-sleeve\u2019 environ-\nment (see Fig. 9.4), and to minimize the vibrations and\nacoustic pressure and shock loads transmitted to the crew\nand to critical systems, in particular during launch and\nreentry. It must constrain as well the deformation of human\nbody below sustainable limits.\n\nFor long exposure to the space environment (for\ninstance, the International Space Station) the structure must\nprotect the crew against micrometeoroid/debris impacts\nthroughout its operational life. The function of the crewed\nspace vehicle structure is not only to protect the crew, but\nalso all systems that are critical for the sustainability and\nprotection of life such as life support, power generation,\nthermal control, communications, food and waste manage-\nment, and aerodynamics.\n\nThe crewed space structure is designed to perform its\nfunctions during the complete mission, taking into consid-\neration the possible material degradation due to exposure to\ndifferent environments during its entire lifetime, in partic-\nular space environment exposure and atmospheric reentry.\nIt must be designed to prevent or reduce other hazards such\nas pressurized system explosion, high touch temperatures,\nsharp edges, and the presence of toxic materials.\n\nIt must be noted that facilities, payloads, instruments,\nexperiments and other systems that are to be operated inside\na crewed vehicle must also be considered as well to be\ncrewed spacecraft structures.\n\nThe design of crewed spacecraft structures must also\ntake into account human factors and accessibility require-\nments in order to simplify not only nominal operations but\nalso the means of access to the spacecraft and the recovery\nof the crew after landing. It can be required also to provide\nvisibility of the outer environment (e.g. viewports, see the\nCupola Fig. 9.5). In addition, structures and mechanism\nmust not create noise and vibration levels that exceed the\nlimits imposed by crew comfort and equipment constraints.\n\nGiven that safety is one of the main aspects to be opti-\nmized, a crewed structure has to overcome all the poten-\ntially hazardous functions not only in nominal mission\n\nFig. 9.3 The near Infrared\nSpectrometer for JWST SiC100\noptical bench and some optics. It\noperates at 30 K. Image EADS\nAstrium\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 199\n\n\n\nscenarios, but cover all credible contingencies. The appli-\ncation of damage tolerance or fault tolerance principles for\nthe mitigation of catastrophic and critical hazards is an\nessential part of the structural verification of space flight\nvehicles, modules, payloads, and ground support equip-\nment. Mechanical failures that may result in loss of life,\nsevere injury, or major damage to the hardware, must be\nprevented. For that purpose, damage tolerance principles\nare applied to ensure that undetected cracks and other\ndefects existing in the structure do not lead to failure within\nthe service life of critical hardware. All structural items\nwhose failure would result in a catastrophic or critical\n\nhazard (e.g. disintegration, loose item, crew impact, loss of\ncritical function, jamming, et cetera) are designed and\nverified according to fracture control principles. Redun-\ndancy is the preferred solution to reduce the risk that the\nfailure of a structural element having catastrophic conse-\nquences. When the implementation of redundant structures\nis not feasible, the design shall rely on a damage tolerance\napplication to ensure that no defect will grow into a com-\nplete failure in the design lifetime.\n\nThe Columbus laboratory module is shown in Fig. 9.6\npermanently attached to the International Space Station\n(ISS). It is a cylindrical structure built from welded\n\nFig. 9.4 European Space\nAgency astronaut Andre Kuipers,\nExpedition 30 flight engineer,\nprepares to insert ESA Role of\nApoptosis in Lymphocyte\nDepression 2 (ROALD-2)\nexperiment samples into a Minus\nEighty Laboratory Freezer for\nISS (MELFI-1) dewar tray\nlocated in the International Space\nStation\u2019s Kibo laboratory.

The\nmeteoroid and debris protection panels are built in alumi-\nnum and Kevlar. Note that crewed space structures are\nmainly built of metallic materials, especially aluminum.\nThe SOLAR payload is shown in Fig. 9.7 on the outside of\nthe Columbus module. Its structure was built of aluminum\nand carbon-fiber sandwich panels in order to minimize Sun-\npointing distortions.\n\nA typical crewed vehicle has generally to withstand all\nthe loads that are common for robotic vehicles. Therefore,\naccording to the specific launcher requirements, low\n\nfrequency accelerations, random vibration, acoustic pres-\nsure and shocks, are generally applicable load-cases to be\nconsidered. In addition, crewed structures are designed to\nsustain pressure loads and crew loads (handling loads but\nalso inadvertent ones such as kicks). Pressure loads can vary\nfrom about 1 bar of change for hulls to hundreds of bars for\npressure vessels. Crew loads can be as high as 560 N for\ninadvertent kicks, applied on a relatively small area. In\naddition, when a crewmember has to operate a mechanism,\nthe reaction forces must be low enough to allow the\nintended crewed actuation. Both pressure loads and kick\nloads can be critical for shatterable materials that, if they are\n\nFig. 9.6 S122E009992 (18\nFebruary 2008) A close-up view\nof the Columbus laboratory\nmodule (center), permanently\nattached to the ISS.

The veri-\nfication campaign can be quite intensive, and the design\nloads are sometimes driven by test loads (both for qualifi-\ncation and acceptance). In particular, proof tests for pres-\nsurized systems are usually more severe than other loads\nexperienced during the mission. Also in case of the proto-\nflight approach, such as without development of a prototype\nqualification model, the structure is designed to withstand\nqualification loads as part of its design life.\n\n9.1.2 Launch Vehicle\n\nLaunch vehicles such as Ariane 5 and Vega can be char-\nacterized as respectively multi- and mono-body launchers;\nrefer to Fig. 9.8. The bodies of the launchers are slender,\ntall structures designed to withstand loads such as longitu-\ndinal acceleration as well as the lateral loads due to blast\nwaves, atmospheric gusts, and thrust vector control steering.\nIn addition, the substructures such as cryogenic stages,\nboosters, and solid rocket motor stages, are loaded by\ninternal pressurization ranging from a few bars to approx-\nimately 100 bars of differential. The stages of the launcher\nare each jettisoned after burnout in order to facilitate effi-\ncient transportation of the payload into low Earth orbit. This\n\nmay also induce engine cut-off loads and subsequently\nshock loads due to stage separation.\n\nIn terms of architecture, launch vehicles can be broken\ndown into inter-stages, solid rocket motor boosters\n(Ariane 5), solid rocket motors (Vega), cryogenic propul-\nsion stage (Ariane 5), upper composite liquid propulsion\nstage, and a payload fairing. The Vega substructure archi-\ntecture is described now as an example. The main parts of\nthe cryogenic and solid propellant propulsion stages are\npressure vessel tanks made of aluminum, steel or composite\noverwrapped pressure vessels (COPVs) which have to\nsustain loads induced by internal pressure as well as flight\nloads. The dome structures at the forward and aft ends of a\ntank have to withstand the axial loads induced by the\ninternal pressure; refer to Fig. 9.9.\n\nIn addition, the aft dome of Vega accommodates the\nnozzle loads via the flex joint that attaches the nozzle to the\npolar boss of the aft dome. The actuators of the thrust\nvectoring control system are attached on the one side to the\naft frame of the motor skirt and to the other to the nozzle\nattachment points. The various cylindrical or conical inter-\nstages form the junctions between consecutive stages, and\nare split into two parts by pyrotechnic devices at stage\nseparation. The liquid propulsion stage of the upper com-\nposite houses the oxidizer and fuel propellant tanks (1st\nlevel) and the avionics for launcher attitude control (2nd\nlevel). The payload adapter, made of carbon-fiber-rein-\nforced polymer, CFRP, composite, connects the payload to\nthe launcher via a pyrotechnic clamp band device. The\n\nFig. 9.8 Ariane 5 with the\nCluster spacecraft and Vega\nlaunch vehicles. Image ESA\n\n202 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\npayload fairing is made of a CFRP sandwich shell and\nprotects the payload from wind, rain and hail during\natmospheric flight, as well as from acoustics and thermal\nloads.\n\nThe mechanical requirements for the design and devel-\nopment of a launch vehicle, in particular for structures, are\ndifferent to those of space vehicle structures. They are\nprescribed for each subsystem (stage, inter-stage) sepa-\nrately. The loads are typically a mix of quasi-static (linear\nloads and bending moments) plus dynamic (sine, acoustic).\nFor cryo-temperature stages, the thermal loads are of great\nimportance and drive the design. Additionally, the pressure\nloads induced in the solid booster cases during ignition\ncould also drive the design of these elements. The ECSS-E-\nSTD-32C and other standards and handbooks mentioned in\nSects. 9.16.1 and 9.16.2 provide detailed requirements.\n\nThe limit loads are in fact the design limit loads and the\nfactor of safety logic is presented later, see Fig. 9.17. The\nsafety factor KQ is typically 1.25 and the acceptance factor\nof safety KA = 1.0; other factors are dependent on the\nproject. In order to decouple the launcher vehicle from the\nengines, pumps etc., certain stiffness requirements for the\ncomplete launch vehicle are required and translated into\nstage and inter-stage stiffness requirements.\n\nThe space mission environments for launch vehicle or\nspacecraft structures are associated to the same dimen-\nsioning load cases. The categories of environments include\nstatic, low frequency transient, low frequency harmonic,\nacoustic and shock environments. The static environment is\nassociated with the acceleration of the launch vehicle along\nits flight trajectory, and applies to the vehicle center of\nmass. The low frequency dynamic environments induced by\ntransient and harmonic low-frequency loads are combined\n\nwith the static environment to obtain the complete total low-\nfrequency load environment. These environments are\ndimensioning loads for interface strength verification and\nthe strength assessment of the load-carrying structures.\n\n9.1.3 Reentry Vehicle\n\nA reentry vehicle is the part of a spacecraft that reenters\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere. The best-known example is probably\nthe US Space Shuttle (now retired). The most used reentry\nvehicle in history is the Soviet/Russian Soyuz descent\nmodule, first used in 1966; see Fig. 9.10.\n\nIn 1985, Europe decided to develop its own capabilities\nfor crewed space flight and the development of the\nColumbus laboratory module, the Ariane 5 heavy-lift\nlauncher and the Hermes spaceplane followed. Initial study\nand pre-development work was concluded for Hermes in\n1992. The program was stopped due to difficulties in\nattaining the cost or performance goals, but European\nefforts on the development of reentry vehicles continued\nwith the X-38 and the Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator\n(ARD). The X-38 was a pathfinder, in cooperation with\nNASA, towards the Crew Return Vehicle (CRV) of the\nInternational Space Station. The ARD was a demonstrator\ncapsule, whose shape was based on Apollo. It successfully\nflew on board an Ariane 5 in October 1998. The latest\nEuropean developments for reentry vehicles are the Inflat-\nable Reentry and Descent Technology (IRDT) demonstra-\ntor, the European EXPErimental Reentry Testbed\n(EXPERT) and the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle\n(IXV). EXPERT is illustrated in Fig. 9.11, and IXV in\nFig. 9.12.\n\nFig. 9.9 Vega\u2019s Attitude and\nVernier Upper Module (AVUM)\nliquid propulsion stage. Image\nESA\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 203\n\n\n\nIn the vehicles mentioned previously, different structural\nconcepts were used for the primary structure. Winged\nvehicles such as the Space Shuttle, Hermes and the X-38\napplied typical airplane construction, using frames and\nstringers in combination with a metallic skin. The ARD\nused a front shield structure and a lateral cone made of\nstiffened metallic panels. The demonstrators EXPERT and\nIXV have innovative configurations: a full hot-structure\nconfiguration for EXPERT and a monocoque configuration\nwith several bulkheads for IXV. In the special case of\ninflatable reentry vehicles, part of the heat shield structure is\nmade of a flexible envelope inflated by gas.\n\nThe primary structure is the structure that provides the\nexternal geometry of the vehicle, and sustains the external\nloads. The primary (\u2018cold\u2019) structure is made of standard\naerospace materials (such as aluminum alloys, CFRP, or\neven titanium alloys), and is protected by a thermal pro-\ntection system (TPS). The TPS may be made of ablative\n\nmaterials. However, in some cases it is more efficient to\nselect a concept based on \u2018hot structures\u2019. A hot structure\nprovides the required strength and stiffness and is able to\nsustain the high temperatures. Typical examples are the\nvehicle nose, wing leading edges, and control surfaces\n(rudders and flaps). These are made of ceramic matrix\ncomposites. More details are given in Sect. 9.5.\n\nReentry vehicles are subjected to specific load cases\nduring their mission, such as to ground, transportation and\nlaunch loads. These vehicles are also subjected to reentry,\ndescent and landing loads. The entry interface is typically\ndefined starting at 100 km altitude. This load case involves a\nheat flux applied on external surfaces of the vehicle due to\naerodynamic heating; this heat flux is proportional to qV3,\nwhere q is the atmosphere density and V the vehicle\nvelocity. Whilst traveling through the denser layers of the\natmosphere, the external surfaces are subjected to dynamic\npressure that decelerates the vehicle; this deceleration is\nproportional to the dynamic pressure 12 qV\n\n2. In case of active\ncontrol surfaces (such as flaps), local loads are applied to the\nstructure during reentry. These heating, deceleration, and\nlocal loads evolve during the reentry and do not have their\nmaxima at the same time. It is necessary to define dimen-\nsioning load cases. The descent phase follows the reentry.\nDuring this phase, the vehicle is decelerated to the required\nend velocity. Aerodynamic decelerators, such as parachutes,\nare used. Opening a parachutes imposes a sudden deceler-\nation (shock) on the vehicle. Finally, the vehicle is brought\nto rest on the Earth\u2019s surface. Different landing options are\navailable: on land (Soyuz capsules), on water (Apollo cap-\nsules) or on a runway (Space Shuttle, or USAF X-37B). In\nall cases, the residual kinetic energy must be dissipated to\nlimit the resulting loads on the vehicle. Various types of\nstructures are available for this energy absorption: para-\nchutes, landing gears with dampers, crushable structures or\nairbags (or a combination thereof). An airbag and a para-\nchute landing system are shown in Fig. 9.13.\n\nFig. 9.10 Soyuz TMA Spacecraft diagram.

Henriksen\n\n\n\nSpace environments are hostile for reentry vehicles\nbecause the structure is subjected to a combination of extreme\nenvironments. In particular, the vehicle is subjected to a\nplasma of dissociated species (oxygen, nitrogen, etc.), which\n\ninteracts with the external surfaces. When hot structures are\nmade of ceramic matrix composites, a quick erosion of the\nsurface through \u2018active oxidation\u2019 of the material is expected.\nDuring the descent in the lower part of the atmosphere, the\n\nFig. 9.12 The Intermediate\neXperimental Vehicle under\nconstruction (left) and visualized\nduring reentry (right)\n\nFig. 9.13 Two different landing\noptions; Engineers test huge,\nmulti-lobed air bags, the type\nwhich protected the Mars\nPathfinder spacecraft before it\nimpacted the surface of Mars,\n(top) and the Dragon spacecraft\nshortly after splashdown and\nbeing dragged by the main chutes\n(bottom).

In particular, winds and gusts\nwill affect the descent, and meteorological phenomena (rain,\nhail, sand blast, salt air, etc.) may influence the strength and\nstiffness of structures. The surface conditions at landing are\nimportant parameters to define the landing loads: runway\nroughness, sea waves, rocks on ground, etc.\n\nThe structures and materials of reentry vehicles differ\nfrom structures of a typical spacecraft, due to the additional\nspecific loads and environment to which they are subjected\nduring entry, descent, and landing. The opportunity to\nreturn a space vehicle to Earth also opened a new per-\nspective: reusability.\n\n9.1.4 Pressurized Structures\n\nA pressurized system is a system in which pressure loads are\nimportant for its design. An important standard for pres-\nsurized systems is ECSS-E-ST-32-02C. Typical cases\non-board spacecraft are the tanks of the propulsion system,\nas shown in Fig. 9.14. Also liquid propulsion based\nlaunchers are essentially pressure systems, because fluid\nflows from the tanks to the nozzle, pressurized by stored\nhigh-pressure gas or pumps.\n\nOn crewed space vehicles, pressurized systems can have\nless conventional architectures, for example elements of life\nsupport systems, or containers used for biology or physi-\nology experiments. Moreover, the nature of pressurized\ncomponents differ, including human modules, vessels that\nhave to contain fluids at hundreds of bars of pressure, pip-\ning, valves and bellows, and many others. Therefore, it is\n\ndifficult to define a unique verification strategy valid for\nevery pressurized system. Before any verification plan is\nestablished, a pressurized system has to be classified in\nterms of lower level categories. However, pressurized sys-\ntems have in common the fact that their failure usually\nmeans the failure or degradation of the mission. This is true\nnot only because of the importance of their functionality,\nbut also because they store and distribute energy. If such\nenergy is suddenly released it could endanger the integrity\nof the whole spacecraft or space vehicle.\n\nAn early step in verification is defining the limit design\nload, which is usually referred to as maximum design\npressure, external mechanical static, dynamic and thermo-\nelastic loads. In human space flight or ground operations in\nthe presence of humans, a high level of safety is required.\nFor these pressurized structures, the maximum design\npressure is that calculated by taking into account the one or\ntwo worst-case failures that could occur.\n\nA further aspect to be considered in the design of pres-\nsurized systems is the compatibility of the container with its\ncontents. Special care must be taken in systems containing\nhighly reacting fluids. For example, only low flammable\nmaterials can be used in pure O2 systems. When ignition is\nnot desired and a flammable atmosphere could be present,\nthe design must not include any ignition source. In addition,\nstress corrosion cracking (SCC) and hydrogen embrittle-\nment are two phenomena that are of concern and should be\navoided by appropriate design controls.\n\nThe first step in designing and verifying a pressurized\nsystem is the classification and definition of the applicable\nrequirements. Pressurized hardware can be classified\naccording the following categories\n\nFig. 9.14 Pressure vessel of the\nxenon tank of the Dawn probe.\nImage NASA/JPL\n\n206 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\n\u2022 Pressure vessels\n\u2022 Pressurized structures\n\u2022 Pressurized components\n\u2022 Special pressurized equipment.\n\nPressure vessels are pressurized hardware designed pri-\nmarily for the storage of pressurized fluid with high energy\nand/or pressure level. The usually accepted limit for a\ncontainer to be classified as a pressure vessel is an energy\nlevel greater than or equal to 19,310 Joules or a pressure\ngreater than or equal to 0.69 MPa. This limit is based on the\npotential energy within a pressurized gas assuming that it\nwill adiabatically expand. The formula for calculating this\nenergy is\n\nE \u00bc P1V\nc? 1 1?\n\nP1\nP2\n\n? ?c?1c\" #\n\u00f09:1\u00de\n\nwhere E is the stored energy \u00f0J\u00de; P1 and P2 are the internal\nand external pressures, respectively \u00f0Pa\u00de; V is the pressur-\nized volume m3\u00f0 \u00de and c is the ratio of specific heats for the\ngas.\n\nA pressurized vessel commonly used in crewed and\nrobotic spacecraft, as well as in launchers is the composite\noverwrapped pressure vessel (COPV). A COPV is a vessel\nconsisting of a thin, non-structural liner, wrapped with a\nstructural fiber composite designed to contain a fluid under\npressure. The liner provides a barrier between the fluid and\nthe composite, preventing leaks (which can occur through\nmatrix micro-cracks that do not cause structural failure) and\nchemical degradation of the structure. The most commonly\nused composites are fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) using\ncarbon and Kevlar fibers. The primary advantage of a\nCOPV, both for high and low pressure applications, is the\nmass saving compared to monolithic metallic vessels. The\nCOPV shall be designed to show Leak Before Burst\n\nbehavior when subjected to the Maximum Design Pressure\n(Fig. 9.15).\n\nPressurized structures are designed to carry both internal\npressure and space vehicle structural loads, such as launch\nvehicle main propellant tanks, crew cabins and crew mod-\nules. A pressurized component is a pressurized system,\nother than a pressure vessel, pressurized structure, or special\npressurized equipment, that is designed for the internal\npressure. Valves, bellows, and connectors are examples of\npressurized components. Special pressurized equipment\nwith no straightforward classification includes heat pipes,\ncryostats, and hazardous fluid containers. Specific require-\nments have to be defined for each member of this category.\nUltimate strength capabilities are usually verified by tests\non qualification models (QM). Minimum burst factors\ncommonly used are defined in the standards ECSS-E-STD-\n32-02C and ECSS-E-STD-32-10C, e.g.\n\u2022 1.5 for pressure vessels\n\u2022 2.0 for human modules and pressure vessels in human\n\napplications\n\u2022 3.0 for pressurised shatterable materials (e.g. glass\n\nwindows)\n\u2022 4.0 for small lines and flexible lines.\n\nProof testing is done for acceptance of the pressurized\nflight hardware. The level of the proof test is designed to\nscreen for defects that could grow and create failure during\nthe complete lifetime of the structural item. Leak tightness\ntests and non-destructive inspections have to be performed\nafter proof testing in order to verify the integrity of the\nsystem. A reduced verification program could be imple-\nmented for leaks before pressurized structures would burst,\nwhen the leakage does not result in hazardous conse-\nquences. Qualification and acceptance tests must take into\naccount the operational environment of the structure to be\nverified. This is especially true for hardware that has to\n\nFig. 9.15 A braided composite\noverwrapped pressure vessel and\ninset the 70l xenon COPV. Image\nA&P Technology (main) and\nEADS Astrium (inset)\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 207\n\n\n\noperate at temperatures that are very different from normal\nenvironmental temperature and also for pressurized struc-\ntures that have to sustain additional loads besides the\napplied pressure.\n\nThe functionality of each component has to be verified\nduring the acceptance campaign. In the design of pressur-\nized systems, the designer must be aware that some com-\nponents have a limited life (e.g. elastomeric materials used\nfor O-rings) or need a recertification after some time (e.g.\nrelief valves) (Fig. 9.16).\n\n9.2 Mechanical Design/Mission\nRequirements of Space Vehicle\nStructures\n\nThe mechanical design requirements for a spacecraft\n(crewed and robotic), reentry vehicle, or pressurized struc-\nture are mainly imposed by the applied launch vehicle,\nmission, orbit, descent and landing. The mechanical design\nrequirements for launch vehicle structures depend on a\nnumber of parameters, including the number of stages,\nboosters, payload mass, required orbit, launch trajectories,\nlaunch site, etc., and are specified during the development\nof the launch vehicle structures.\n\nAll space vehicle structures must withstand the launch\nenvironment, specified in the launch vehicle manual. The\nhandling and transportation loads are, in general, lower than\nthe test and launch loading conditions. However, attention\nmust be paid to these loads. The most important mechanical\ndesign requirements mentioned in launch vehicle manuals are\n\u2022 The spacecraft materials shall satisfy outgassing criteria,\n\ne.g. recovered mass loss (RML) and collected volatile\ncondensable material (CVCM). Measurement procedure\nshall be in accordance to ECSS-Q-70-02A.\n\n\u2022 The total rigid body mass and associated characteristic\nsuch as the center of mass and the second moments of\nmass of the space vehicle are restricted to prevent over-\nloading of the launch vehicle payload adapters.\n\n\u2022 The space vehicle shall meet minimum stiffness\nrequirements both in launch and lateral directions in a\nstowed configuration. This is mostly manifested in min-\nimum natural frequencies under specified boundary con-\nditions (most times fixed at the interface between the\nspace vehicle and the launch vehicle). The minimum\nnatural frequencies depend on the total launch mass of the\nspace vehicle. Minimum natural frequency requirements\nare posed to prevent dynamic coupling between the\nlaunch vehicle and the space vehicle. Therefore, the\nminimum natural frequency requirement is very\nimportant.\n\n\u2022 The dimensioning of the space vehicle structure should\nbe done using the specified quasi-static loads (QSL), such\nthat the specified minimum stiffness requirements are\nmet. This activity is more or less an interactive process.\nThe quasi-static loads are typically specified as the\ncombination of steady-state accelerations and low-fre-\nquency vibrations, which have no direct dynamic cou-\npling with the space vehicle. The running load in the\npayload adapter between the launch vehicle and the space\nvehicle shall be as uniform as possible in order to prevent\noverloading of the payload adapter (line-load peaking).\nThe stiffness, stability and strength of the space vehicle\nstructure shall be verified by a static-load test. The QSL\nare increased by a test factor.\n\n\u2022 Besides the quasi-static loads, dynamic mechanical,\nacoustic, and shock test loads are specified. The space\nvehicle shall survive these dynamic test loads, increased\nby test factors specified by the launch vehicle authority.\nThis means that the test loads are more severe than the\n\nFig. 9.16 Typical classification\nof human space pressurized\nhardware\n\n208 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\nreal launch loads. The following mechanical dynamic\nloads are specified\n\u2013 Sinusoidal enforced acceleration at the base of the\n\nspace vehicle, normally in the frequency band between\n5 and 100 Hz. The frequency range will be passed with\na certain sweep rate in order to prevent dwell\nsituations.\n\n\u2013 Acoustical reverberant loads simulated in a reverberant\nacoustic chamber. This is idealization of the real\nlaunch acoustic loads is very difficult. The frequency\nrange is between 20 and 10,000 Hz.\n\n\u2013 Random enforced acceleration specification at the\ninterface of the space vehicle. The random vibrations\nare not always specified. However, for instruments,\nequipment, tanks, etc., these random vibrations are of\ngreat importance. Mechanical random vibrations are\ndue to structure-borne sound. The random vibrations\nare specified in a frequency range between 20 and\n2,000 Hz.\n\n\u2013 Shock loads are specified at the base of the space\nvehicle. The shock loads are specified by a shock\nresponse spectrum (SRS) in the frequency range\nbetween 100 and 10,000 Hz. The shock load environ-\nment is dependent on both the total mass of the space\nvehicle and the connection between the payload and\nthe launch vehicle (clamp band or pyro-techniques).\n\n\u2022 Depressurization during launch is considered in order to\nprevent the build-up of pressure loads in instrumentation\nand structures; for example, sandwich construction.\nDepressurization is prevented by implementing venting\nholes of adequate size.\n\n\u2022 Mechanical interfaces with the launch vehicle, such as\nthe dynamic envelope to prevent the payload striking the\nfairing. The interface is with the payload adapter through\nthe clamp band.\n\n\u2022 When in operation, the space vehicle shall meet stability\nrequirements in order to avoid for example jitter at the\nline of sight due to micro-vibrations and thermally\ninduced distortions.\nIn addition to the above mechanical design and test\n\nrequirements, the following points may contribute to the\nunderstanding of the mechanical requirements\n\u2022 The structural materials shall be selected in accordance\n\nwith the ECSS standards, in particular ECSS-ST-032C\nand ECSS-E-ST-32-08C. A number of handbooks can be\nused for further evaluation of structural aspects.\n\n\u2022 The mass properties are of great importance, and shall be\nevaluated during the design and manufacturing phases of\nthe space vehicle (structures) project. Special tools or\nmass generators within the finite element analysis codes\ncan be applied for monitoring the evaluation of the mass\n\nproperties. In the early stage, contingencies shall be\nconsidered in terms of maturity. Later in the project, such\ncontingencies shall be removed.\n\n\u2022 The design of the space vehicle structure is based on the\nspecified quasi-static loads in combination with appro-\npriate factors of safety (ECSS-E-ST-32-10C). Besides\nquasi-static loads, the stiffness of the space vehicle and\ndynamic loads are also important. The balance between\nthe strength of the structure and its stiffness and dynamic\nload carrying capability is an iterative process. Un-\ndamped natural frequency properties of structural ele-\nments can be found in [4]. Informative books about the\nstrength of material are [5\u20137]. For stability (buckling)\nanalysis of structural elements the following handbooks\nare very useful: NASA SP-8007, 8019 and ECSS-E-HB-\n32-24A. Strength is the capability of the structure to\nsustain the design load without failure preventing mission\nsuccess. This basic structural requirement for all types of\nspace vehicles applies to all life cycle load events that the\nstructure will encounter from manufacturing, assembly,\nground handling, transportation and testing, launch and\noperation in flight. Insufficient strength leads to failure.\nStatic-stiffness and dynamic behavior of the space vehicle\n\nstructure can be obtained from simplified models by making\n\u2018hand calculations\u2019 using software tools such as MATLAB?,\nMATHCAD?, WXMaxima? and from more complex\nmathematical models using more advanced numerical tools\nsuch as the finite element analysis (FEA) method [8, 9], the\nboundary element analysis (BEA) method [10], and the\nStatistical Energy Analysis (SEA) method [11].\n\nDamping in structures plays an important role in\ndynamic response (harmonic) analysis in the frequency\ndomain. It is crucial to estimate damping characteristics\nfrom former projects. Space vehicles demonstrate, in gen-\neral, low damping. Modal viscous damping models are\nfrequently applied [12].\n\u2022 The dynamic envelope is the physical space that the\n\ncomplete space vehicle must not exceed, while deflecting\nunder static and dynamic loads to avoid contact between\nthe space vehicle and the fairing of the launch vehicle.\n\n\u2022 In orbit, the structural stability of the space vehicle is of\nimportance because the structure must have the ability to\nmaintain the alignment of the instruments, sensors and\nactuators mounted to it. This must be ensured after having\nsurvived the launch environment and during operations in\norbit. Typical concerns are dynamic disturbers (e.g. reac-\ntion wheels, coolers), thermo-elastic distortions, perma-\nnent deformation, and slippage of mechanical connections.\nStructural stability must ensure that critical instruments,\nsuch as antennas, pointing devices and sensors, stay\naligned in order to prevent performance degradation.\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 209\n\n\n\nThe loading environments encountered by the space\nvehicle during all phases define the design of the structure.\nIn general, the load events are the ground activities\n(assembly, testing, transportation), the launch event, and the\nvehicle operations in space. When applicable, other\nimportant design drivers are in-orbit performance of\nspacecraft structures such as pointing accuracy and struc-\ntural stability. Activities related to space mission environ-\nments, and mechanical loads are identified\n\u2022 Space vehicle structures should not only survive the\n\nlaunch environment but protect the spacecraft non-struc-\ntural components against the hostile space environment.\n\n\u2022 The selected materials, non-structural as well as struc-\ntural, must not unjustifiably degrade before and during\nthe mission.\n\n\u2022 Ground testing activities need to emulate mission envi-\nronments with certain margins. As a result, test environ-\nments need to be defined early on, and structures need to\nbe designed adequately to generate those environments.\n\n\u2022 Mechanical loads have both static and dynamic components,\nand these are defined in launch vehicle user\u2019s manuals.\nThe design of a spacecraft vehicle structure and its\n\nsubsystems must sustain all loads that it will experience.\nTypical loading events are listed in detail in standard ECSS-\nE-ST-32C, and summarized here\n\u2022 Ground handling and transportation\n\u2022 Liftoff\n\u2022 Stage separations\n\u2022 Stage ignition\n\u2022 Stage or main engine cut-off\n\u2022 Maximum aerodynamic pressure and gust conditions\n\u2022 Spin-up and deployments\n\u2022 Attitude control system firings\n\u2022 On-orbit thermal environment\n\u2022 Reentry\n\u2022 Emergency landing (for reentry vehicles)\n\u2022 When proto-flight, all of the ground tests designed to\n\nverify the above.\nThe above events induce steady-state, sine, and random\n\nvibrations, transients, and shocks. In special cases, tem-\nperature gradients may be expected.\n\nThe launcher authority will issue guidelines for the\ndesign and qualification of the spacecraft vehicle. These\napply to the mounting interfaces at its base and are con-\ncerned with both quasi-static and dynamic loads. They will\nbe denoted as flight limit loads (FLL), i.e., levels which are\nnot to be exceeded with a probability 99 % and a confidence\nlevel of 95 %. The launcher authority will require the\nspacecraft designer to demonstrate that the design can\nwithstand its qualification levels. Typical test load factors\nare given in Table 9.1, in which the distinctions between the\nqualification, proto-flight, and acceptance approaches is\nquite clear.\n\nFlight acceptance testing is performed for space vehicle\nstructures and equipment that have already passed test at the\ndesign qualification levels but where the workmanship\nremains to be tested. If a one-model program is followed\n(proto-flight approach, i.e., the prototype is actually flown),\nthen the model must clear the higher qualification test;\nhowever, the duration and sweep rates are respectively\nlower and higher. It must be noted that in the proto-flight\napproach, full design qualification is only achieved when\nthe mission is accomplished. In other words, the inherent\nrisk of the proto-flight approach must be reduced as much as\npossible.\n\nIn the design phase, factors of safety must be applied;\nthese are prescribed and provided in ECSS-E-ST-32-10C.\nThe design logic and the application of factors of safety is\nillustrated in Fig. 9.17, where\n\u2022 QL is the qualification load\n\u2022 AL is the acceptance load\n\u2022 DYL is the design yield load\n\u2022 DUL is the design ultimate load.\n\nThe presented design logic in Fig. 9.17 is applicable for\nall types of space vehicle structures, where the coefficients\nare defined in Table 9.2. Typical factors of safety applied in\nthe space vehicle design are presented in Table 9.3.\n\nThe typical factors of safety are denoted by\n\u2022 KQ, the qualification test factor\n\u2022 KA, the acceptance test factor\n\u2022 FOSY, the yield design factor of safety\n\u2022 FOSU, the ultimate design factor of safety.\n\nTable 9.1 Test factors, rate and duration (from the Ariane 5 User\u2019s manual)\n\nTests Qualification Proto-flight Acceptance\n\nFactors Duration/Rate Factors Duration/Rate Factors Duration/Rate\n\nStatic (QSL) 1.25 N/A 1.25 N/A N/A N/A\n\nSine vibrations 1.25 2 oct/min 1.25 4 oct/min 1.0 4 oct/min\n\nAcoustics +3 dB (or 2) 120 s +3 dB (or 2) 60 s 1.0 60 s\n\nShock +3 dB (or1.41) N/A +3 dB (or 1.41) N/A N/A N/A\n\n210 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\nIt is required that at design yield loads (DYL), only non-\npermanent deformation occurs. This is only applicable for\nmetallic structures. At design ultimate load (DUL) buckling\nwill exceed allowable stress but there will be no failure of\nthe structure. At DYL and DUL the margins of safety (MS)\nmust be positive and sometimes above a certain value. The\ndefinition of the MS is\n\nMSy \u00bc\nAllowable load \u00f0stress\u00de\n\nFOS?Design limit load \u00f0stress\u00de ? 1? 0 \u00f09:2\u00de\n\nThe space mission environments for launch vehicle and\nspacecraft structures are associated to the same dimen-\nsioning load cases. Different categories of environments\nexist such as static, low-frequency transient, low-frequency\nharmonic, acoustic, and shock environments. The static\nenvironment is associated with the acceleration of the\nlaunch vehicle along its flight trajectory and applies to the\nlaunch vehicle center of mass. The low frequency dynamic\n\nenvironments induced by transient and harmonic low-fre-\nquency loads must be combined with the static environment\nto obtain the complete total low-frequency load environ-\nment. These environments are dimensioning loads for\ninterface strength verification and the strength assessment\nof the load carrying structures. Shock and acoustic loads are\nusually dimensioning loads for optical equipment and\nappendages such as stowed solar arrays, reflectors and\ntelescopes.\n\n9.3 Verification of Space Vehicle\nStructures\n\nIn this section, verification by analysis and testing to qualify\nthe space vehicle structure will be discussed. The important\nstandards are ECSS-E-ST-10-02C and ECSS-E-ST-10-03C.\nThe most common structural design validation cycle is shown\nin Fig. 9.18 and is a combination of analyses and tests.\n\n9.3.1 Analytical Verification of Space\nStructures\n\nIn order to evaluate a potential mismatch between assumed\ndesign loads and actual flight loads on a spacecraft a\n\nFig. 9.17 Logic of factors of\nsafety application, ECSS-E-ST-\n32-10C\n\nTable 9.2 Definition of coefficients in Fig. 9.17\n\nSatellite Launch vehicle and pressurized hardware Crewed system\n\nCoef.

In the case\nof severe coupling between launcher and spacecraft\ndynamic modes the actual flight loads could exceed the\nassumed design loads. This coupled dynamic analysis is\ngenerally referred to as a coupled loads analysis and is\nnormally conducted by the launcher authorities. In Fig. 9.19\nthe coupled launcher-payload system of the Vega launcher\nand IXV are depicted. Typical output of the coupled loads\nanalysis are the QSL at the center of mass of the spacecraft,\nthe interface forces, the shock response spectrum, SRS, and\nthe equivalent sine response at the interface, and usually\nsome interior responses at critical elements or locations of\nthe spacecraft structure. The equivalent sine can be used to\nassess the proposed primary and secondary notches neces-\nsary in order to not exceed the design loads and local loads\nrespectively.\n\nBesides the coupled loads analysis, the typical structural\nanalyses performed as part of the analytical verification of\nthe structures are\n\u2022 Modal analysis (to verify frequency requirements).\n\u2022 Static stress analysis , including thermo-elastic analysis\n\n(to derive MOSs).\n\u2022 Stability buckling analysis (to derive MOSs).\n\u2022 Transient analysis (to simulate time-domain loads\n\nevents).\n\u2022 Frequency response analysis (to validate mathematical\n\nmodels and to simulate sine tests).\n\u2022 Fatigue and crack growth analysis (to verify the life of\n\nsafety critical structural elements).\n\n\u2022 Acoustic analysis (to check spacecraft response and to\nderive random spectra).\n\n\u2022 Random response analysis (to predict response to random\nenvironment).\n\n\u2022 Micro-vibrationanalysis (to predict the effect of reaction\nwheels, coolers disturbers on spacecraft functional targets\nlike pointing, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Dynamic displacement (to verify spacecraft to launcher\nfairing stay out zone violations).\nThe un-deformed mathematical model of the Herschel\n\nspacecraft used to perform coupled loads and acoustic\nanalysis is shown in Fig. 9.20, along with the same model\nduring a vibration simulation, alongside an image of the\nHerschel spacecraft on the HYDRA multi-axis vibration\ntable at ESTEC.\n\nThe flow chart for finite element analysis is shown in\nFig. 9.21.\n\nStructural verification is implemented by following a\ndetailed plan that also includes fracture control activities.\nFor crewed structures, fracture control is applied to all\nsafety critical structures that may pose a safety hazard.\nFor robotic spacecraft structures, fracture control is mainly\napplied to critical interfaces (e.g. an optical bench\nattached to the spacecraft platform by means of iso-static\nmounts) and to pressurized tanks. When required, the\nspecific fracture control activities are specified in a sep-\narate plan, normally called the fracture control plan. The\nverification plans must specify the complete list of\nactivities, analyses and tests to be performed to achieve\nthe certification for flight. In addition, the plans must\n\nFig. 9.18 A typical structural\ndesign validation cycle\n\n212 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\nspecify the requirements applicable to procurement, pro-\ncesses, traceability, and the inspection of materials and\nstructural parts. For hardware that is sensitive to damage\nduring handling, such as glass, ceramics, or composite\nmaterials, a damage protection plan must be established to\nensure that the critical parts are adequately protected and\n\nhandled during the complete mission, including ground\nactivities. Structural verification can be divided in two\nmain activities\n\u2022 Demonstrate the capability of the design to perform its\n\nfunctions (qualification).\n\u2022 Certify the quality of the flight hardware (acceptance).\n\nFig. 9.19 Vega launcher and IXV payload\n\nFig. 9.20 Herschel spacecraft\nstructural mathematical model\n(left) and a vibration simulation\nmodel alongside an image of\nHerschel on the HYDRA facility\nat ESTEC.

Usually, the\ntesting sequence involves two phases, a qualification phase,\naiming at qualifying the system and at obtaining confidence in\nthe analytical predictions (which takes place early enough in\nthe project to limit the risk) and then an acceptance phase,\naiming at accepting the end item for the flight. These two\ntypes of tests are demanded by the launcher authority in order\nto show that the structures will survive the launch. In addition,\nfunctional tests can be performed to check the performance of\ncomplete systems and to verify the unit\u2019s specifications.\n\nQualification testing is done on hardware that is fully\nrepresentative of the space vehicle structures in terms of\ndesign, applied materials, tooling and processes. These tests\nare often done using structural thermal models (STM), but\ncan also be done on a proto flight model (PFM). The aims\nof the qualification tests are\n\u2022 Validation of the design and performance of the space\n\nvehicle structure.\n\u2022 Validation of the compatibility of the spacecraft with the\n\nlauncher.\n\u2022 To correlate the finite element model that will be used for\n\nthe coupled load analyses (CLA) (ECSS-E-HB-32-26A).\n\u2022 To validate the equipment/subsystem specifications.\n\nAcceptance tests are performed on the flight hardware:\nflight model (FM) or proto flight model (PFM). The aims of\nthe acceptance tests are\n\u2022 To verify the FM is free from workmanship defects.\n\u2022 To confirm that the FM is able to fulfill mission\n\nrequirements.\nTo limit the cost of the space vehicle project the proto-\n\nflight approach is chosen, in which two testing phases are\ncombined on a PFM that will be tested at qualification\nlevels, but with the duration and the sweep rates at the\nacceptance level (see Table 9.1). This PFM approach will\nincrease the risk during the project. Special tests can be\nperformed on STM, FM, or PFM models\n\u2022 To verify the assumptions taken into account in some\n\nanalyses.\n\u2022 To verify equipment specifications with complementary\n\nanalyses.\n\u2022 To verify the performance of the subsystem.\n\nThe following mechanical tests are performed on the\nstructure\n\u2022 Static load test\n\u2022 Modal survey test\n\u2022 Sine vibration test\n\u2022 Acoustic noise test\n\n\u2022 Random vibration test\n\u2022 Shock test.\n\n9.3.2.1 Static Load Test\nThe objectives of the static qualification test are\n\u2022 To verify the structure can withstand the quasi-static\n\nloads (QSL) without any permanent deformation (deg-\nradation) or failure (strength test). The margins in\nstrength shall be established.\n\n\u2022 To gather relevant information about the stiffness of the\nspace vehicle structure for the correlation the stiffness\nmatrix with the structural finite element model.\nThe quasi-static loads are the dimensioning loads for the\n\nprimary structure (main load path), whereas the vibration\nsine loads are important for the secondary structure. The\nstatic loads test will qualify the primary structure, its\nstructural connections or joints, and the interfaces of heavy\nsubsystems, e.g. tanks, antennas, solar arrays, and instru-\nments. Several approaches can be applied to perform the\nstatic qualification testing, e.g. (1) a static test set-up using a\nwhiffle tree for the introduction of loads, (2) an electro-\ndynamic shaker for sine dwell, sine burst, and sine impulse\ntests or (3) a large centrifuge.\n\u2022 The whiffle tree test consists of a set-up where the\n\nstructure is surrounded by a very stiff rig for the intro-\nduction of loads. A second independent rig is used for\nmeasuring displacements. Hydraulic actuators at specific\npoints of the structure introduce loads. Combinations of\nloads can be applied during the static load test and the\ndisplacement responses and strains can be measured.\nStatic load test results can be correlated with the finite\nelement analysis. An update in the stiffness distribution\n(stiffness matrix) can be made.\n\n\u2022 For smaller spacecraft, a shaker quasi-static test can be\ndone. This is performed on a vibration table at low\nexcitation frequency to simulate a quasi-static loading via\na sinusoidal excitation; however, it can be done in only\none direction at the time. The excitation frequency is\nsufficiently below the first fundament mode frequency of\nthe space vehicle to justify the assumption that it behaves\nlike a rigid body and to avoid any dynamic amplification.\nThe shaker static test has the advantage that it can be\ncombined with the dynamic testing campaign of the space\nvehicle. However, because the loading is uniaxial in the\ncase of large structures it is not always feasible to per-\nform this test at a frequency well below the first mode of\nthe space vehicle. Sine-burst is very popular test method.\nThe enforced sine vibration contains only a few numbers\nof oscillations, therefore hardly any contribution to fati-\ngue will be made (Fig.9.22).\n\n214 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\n\u2022 A centrifuge test is less common. The mechanical loading\nis based on centrifugal acceleration. The disadvantage of\nthis method is that it is not possible to stop the centrifuge\nimmediately in the event of failure of the test item. A\nlimited number of measuring channels are possible.\n\n9.3.2.2 Modal Survey Test\nThe objective of the modal survey test is to validate the\ndynamic behavior of the space vehicle in terms of natural\nfrequencies, modal damping, mode shapes, and modal\neffective mass (ECSS-E-ST-32-11C). The results of modal\nsurvey test can be used to correlate the mass and stiffness\nmatrix of structural finite element model and to demonstrate\ncompatibility with the launcher minimum natural frequen-\ncies requirement. The measured modal damping ratios can\nbe applied for dynamic response analyses in the frequency\ndomain. Attention must be paid to the instrumentation,\nwhich should be placed in such a way that all relevant\nmodes can be adequately observed during the test.\n\n9.3.2.3 Sine Vibration Test\nThe objectives of the sine vibration test are\n\u2022 To qualify the secondary structures with respect to the\n\nlauncher dynamic environment.\n\u2022 To verify the compatibility of the space vehicle with the\n\nlauncher in terms of frequency.\n\u2022 To assess damping characteristics (dynamic amplification).\n\n\u2022 To validate antennas, solar arrays, instruments, equip-\nment, etc.\nThe space vehicle is excited on the shaker table by the\n\nspecified enforced sinusoidal accelerations. The sine\nvibration test is usually followed by a functional test. To\nprevent over-testing, notching of the sine spectrum is often\napplied in agreement with the launcher authority. An\nexample of a typical spacecraft mounted to a multi-shaker\nslip table is shown in Fig. 9.23.\n\n9.3.2.4 Acoustic Test/Random Test\nLarge areal and lightweight structures (antennas, solar\narrays, and radiators) are very sensitive to sound pressure\nlevels (SPL) in the early phase of the launch (i.e. at liftoff).\nAcoustic noise tests are performed at space vehicle and\nsubsystem level\n\u2022 To verify the structural integrity against acoustic loads.\n\u2022 To establish the random vibration specifications (struc-\n\nture-borne random vibrations).\nThe test is performed in a so-called reverberant acoustic\n\nroom, as in Fig. 9.24. A reverberant (diffuse) sound field is\ncreated inside the chamber by the use of different horns.\nThis sound loading will excite the structure and induce\nrelated random mechanical vibrations that are dimensioning\nloads for equipment (subsystems). Thus, random vibration\ntests are performed to validate the integrity of equipment.\nA dynamic shaker will introduce random vibration levels.\n\nFig. 9.22 Static qualification test stand (MMST) for the AlphaBus\ncentral tube and primary structure at Inta (Spain). Image ESA\n\nFig. 9.23 Sine vibration test of the Swarm spacecraft\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 215\n\n\n\nNotching is sometimes needed to prevent over testing. In\ngeneral, random vibrations specifications are covered by the\nacoustic noise test.\n\n9.3.2.5 Shock Test\nShock loads must be validated by test. The high frequency\nloads may cause failures in electronic components, mech-\nanisms, valves, etc. Shock loads are mainly introduced by\nthe launch vehicle; e.g. jettisoning the fairing, stage sepa-\nration, the separation of the space vehicle from the launch\nvehicle, and the release (deployment) of appendages. Shock\ntests are thus separated in two categories\n\u2022 Internal shock test, which is induced by the releasing of\n\ndifferent appendages of the space vehicle.\n\u2022 Launcher shock test, which is induced either by a space\n\nvehicle release test (i.e. the clamp band release test) and/\nor on a dedicated test simulating the launcher shock\nenvironment (e.g. the Shogun test to simulate the fairing\nseparation for Ariane 5, the ASAP-S shock kit to simulate\nthe pyro-release shock of the Dassault separation system\nfor micro-satellites on Soyuz, the VESTA device to\nsimulate the release of the Vega fairing).\nThe shock test will determine the shock transfer func-\n\ntions inside the space vehicle and, by further analyses, the\nqualification levels for the internal subsystems/equipment\ncan be determined. Space vehicle shock tests are performed\non a STM mainly to characterize the transfer functions, and\nequipment shock tests are performed on EQMs in order not\nto expose flight hardware to shock tests. Qualification shock\ntests are always followed by a functional test to ensure the\ncorrect performance of the unit. On a case-by-case basis,\nsome other characterization tests can be performed on the\nspace vehicle.\n\n9.3.2.6 Micro-Vibration Testing\nMicro-vibration testing is performed to characterize the\neffect of micro-vibrations induced by moving parts in the\nspace vehicle, such as reaction wheels or compressors\n(coolers), which can influence the performance of the var-\nious instruments on board. This can be done either with a\nmini-shaker with the objective of retrieving the transfer\nfunctions between the excitation point to the instrument (on\na STM) in order to verify the analyses carried out, or by\nactivating the different exciters in a space vehicle (i.e. flight\nmodel) and observing the disturbances on the instrument\ndirectly. The spacecraft is suspended (almost free\u2013free)\nduring the performance of the micro-vibration tests, see\nFig. 9.25.\n\n9.3.2.7 Thermo-Elastic Testing\nThermo-elastic test are performed to measure the thermo-\nelastic deformation caused by temperature gradients, in\norder to check the effect of deformations on the perfor-\nmance (line of sight) of the instruments. It is not always\npossible to find a test set-up representative of the real\nthermal environment, so this test is mainly used to verify\nthe FEM used to analyze thermo-elastic effects.\n\n9.3.2.8 Crewed Space Flight Structures\nFor crewed space flight, qualification is performed to load\nlevels that are higher than the maximum expected flight\nlevels. This has to be performed both at component and\nsystem levels. Qualification of a crewed structure must be\nperformed by a series of tests and analyses. The following\nlist shows the typical tests that are performed for qualifi-\ncation purposes\n\nFig. 9.24 The Herschel\nspacecraft being prepared for\ntests in the acoustic chamber at\nESA/ESTEC. Image ESA\n\n216 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\n\u2022 Static strength test\n\u2022 Random vibration test\n\u2022 Shock test\n\u2022 Acoustic pressure test (capability to sustain acoustic load)\n\u2022 Acoustics emission test (for human space flight, to verify\n\nthat the life support hardware does not exceeds the\naudible noise requirements)\n\n\u2022 Microgravity (micro-vibration) test\n\u2022 Burst pressure tests.\n\nOf course, the list of structural tests can be tailored for the\nspecific application, depending on the structure (pressurized\nhuman modules, glasses of a camera, pressurized systems,\netc.). It is not always possible to reproduce on the ground all\nthe loading conditions that will happen during the mission,\nso analyses based on test-correlated models are applied to\ncomplement a program of verification by test. Verification\nby \u2018analysis only\u2019 of crewed structures is also possible. In\nthis case, the analysis methods are validated by dedicated\ntests and applied within their validated domain. Acceptance\nof a flight model is performed by a series of tests intended to\nscreen for possible defects and bad workmanship, and also to\ncharacterize the as-built capabilities\n\u2022 Random vibration test\n\u2022 Acoustic pressure test\n\u2022 Acoustics emission test (for human space flight, to verify\n\nthat the life support hardware does not exceeds the\naudible noise requirements)\n\n\u2022 Microgravity (micro-vibration) test\n\n\u2022 Proof pressure tests\n\u2022 Inspections (e.g. dye penetrant inspections on finished\n\nmetallic parts).\nAcceptance tests are performed at the maximum expec-\n\nted flight loads and are to check for workmanship defects.\nMaximum flight expected loads can be exceeded on a flight\nmodel only when the test is to screen for the absence of\ndefects that would cause the failure of the structure under\nnominal loads.\n\nThe preferred option for structural verification is to\nperform qualification tests on prototypes: flight-like models\nthat will not be used for a mission. Such models are referred\nto as qualification models. When this is not possible, some\nqualification tests can be performed on the flight model.\nThis increases the risk of damage to the vehicle that it is\ntested at qualification levels, without actually confirming\nthe full status of the flight hardware; therefore it is not a\ncommended option. It is normally only used when sufficient\nexperience with similar structures exists. The structure has\nto be designed to withstand qualification loads.\n\nSafety factors to be applied in the verification of crewed\nstructures are usually higher than those for robotic missions.\nCommon ultimate safety factors for metallic structures, or\ncomposite structures in no-discontinuity areas, are 1.4 for\nlaunch loads and 1.5 for in-orbit loads. Such safety factors are\ntypically increased to 2.0 for discontinuity areas in composite\nelements. The minimum safety factor for shatterable mate-\nrials is 3.0. Ultimate safety factors for pressurized structures\n\nFig. 9.25 NigeriaSat-2\nstructural engineering model\nundergoing micro-vibration\ntesting. Image SSTL\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 217\n\n\n\ncan go from 2.0 for habitable modules up to 4.0 for flexible\nlines in fluid systems. In the case of analysis-only verifica-\ntion, the safety factors have to be increased.\n\n9.4 Loads Attenuation: Damping\nand Isolation in Space Vehicle\nStructures\n\nDamping measures the dissipation of energy that occurs\nduring vibration or shock of a structure and is a structural\ncharacteristic that limits the magnitude and duration of\nresponse to input forces. Vibration isolation aims to reduce\nthe effects of vibration on a given structure by isolating it\nfrom the source of vibrations. The function of an isolator is\neither to reduce the magnitude of motion transmitted from a\nvibrating support to the equipment or to reduce the magni-\ntude of force transmitted from the equipment to its supporting\nstructure. The performance of an isolator to steady-state\nsinusoidal vibration may be evaluated by the absolute\ntransmissibility (ratio of vibration amplitude of the equip-\nment to the vibration amplitude of the supporting structure),\nthe relative transmissibility (ratio of the relative deflection\namplitude of the isolator to the displacement amplitude\nimposed at the supporting structure), or the motion response\n(ratio of the displacement amplitude of the equipment to the\nquotient obtained by dividing the excitation force amplitude\nby the static stiffness of the isolator).\n\nSources of vibration can be either external (e.g. launcher)\nor internal to the spacecraft (moving parts, mechanisms, and\nso forth). In the latter case, one usually describes the\nvibration as disturbance vibrations. Those vibrations can be\ndetrimental to the spacecraft integrity due to their amplitude\n(e.g. the launcher dynamic environment or separation\nshocks) or to a sensitive receiver performance (e.g. an\noptical payload sensitive to micro-vibrations). Attenuation\nof those loads is therefore a constant preoccupation in the\ndesign of spacecraft structures.\n\nGenerally speaking, depending upon the design princi-\nple, vibration control systems can be classified as either\ndamping or isolation. Each class can be further categorized\nas an active or a passive control system. For passive\ndamping systems, the idea is to dissipate the vibration\nenergy at various locations distributed on the structure in\norder to control the vibration amplitude of any resonance\nthat may lead to excessive stresses (see Fig. 9.26). Damping\ntreatments require the selection of appropriate materials,\nlocations of the treatment, and choice of configurations, to\nassure the transfer of deformations from the structure to the\ndamping elements. However, the necessary extra mass\nconstrains the use of passive system over large areas.\nMoreover, passive damping limits the amplification at res-\nonance but tends also to reduce the high-frequency attenu-\nation, and this could turn to be problematic with harmonic\nsources like reaction wheel assemblies (RWA) and/or\ncryocoolers.\n\nFig. 9.26 Dampers used in\nspace structures. Image Astrium\n\nFig. 9.27 Shock attenuation\nsystem for spacecraft and\nadapter. Image Astrium\n\n218 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\nPassive vibration isolation is implemented by placing the\nequipment on appropriate mountings (see Fig. 9.27). A\nvariety of implementation devices can be used, including\nviscous-elastic materials, springs, soft materials, hydraulic\ndampers and pneumatic isolators. For the Hubble Space\nTelescope, a passive isolation system designed by Honey-\nwell that employed a viscous fluid-damped isolator was\nused to mitigate the effects of the RWA. Another example\nof an isolator used in several space missions is the Hon-\neywell D-strut, which uses a bellows system with a viscous\ndamped-fluid similar to the one used on the Hubble Space\nTelescope. Rather than implementing sophisticated devices\nor materials, secondary structures can be properly designed\nto mitigate or reduce mechanism-generated disturbance:\nmodifying equipment locations in order to increase the\ndecoupling between the source and the receiver only by\nmodifying the load path; modifying the location of a par-\nticular stiffener; or designing mechanical junctions between\nplates and beams, etc., to reduce the coupling between the\nsubstructures.\n\nActive systems usually supply additional power to the\nsystem in order to modify its own dynamic behavior.\nDespite the complexity of active systems, in some cases\nthey represent the only solution to achieve the requested\nlevels and bandwidth of attenuation. They are usually\nbased on local feedback between a co-located sensor and\nactuator, and they generate an output force proportional\nto the measured function. One of the main control issues\nis related to the finite bandwidth of controls and \u2018spill-\nover\u2019 effects. The principle of another possible approach,\nactive compensation through centralized adaptive control,\nis to generate vibrations using actuators in order to\ndestructively interfere with the disturbances to cancel the\njitter of the sensitive instruments. Active isolation is able\nto simultaneously achieve a low amplification at reso-\nnance and a large attenuation at high frequency. In [13],\nan active six degrees of freedom local vibration isolation\napplied to a flexible space telescope has been studied for\nattenuating high-frequency disturbances. A six-axis sin-\ngle-stage active vibration isolator based on a Stewart\nplatform has been developed for space application in\n[14]. And, for spacecraft whose primary structure are\nstruts, actively controlled struts can be used to attenuate\nloads and/or disturbances.\n\nActive damping has been implemented in the piezo-\nelectric Stewart platform. This uses a stiff active damping\ninterface as a support for payloads and consists of a Stewart\nplatform with six degrees of freedom, where each leg of the\nactive interface is made of a linear piezoelectric actuator. A\nmixed control approach may be needed in some cases. For\nexample, an integrated active damping device (IADD a\npiezo based device) arranged in hexapod configuration has\nbeen studied for spacecraft requiring high pointing\n\naccuracy. Similar approaches, where a frame platform has\nbeen designed to act as a supporting structure for devices\nlike RWAs, and where a vibration isolation interface\nbetween the spacecraft and terminal with appropriate\ntransmissibility characteristics is designed using a mono-\nlithic passive flexible element (MEDI), can be used to\ncontrol stiffness and damping. Passive springs and viscous\ndamping from a linear motor, which may provide activator\nand sensor functions, provide stiffness.\n\n9.5 Space Vehicle Materials\nand Processes\n\nHigh quality materials and processes are required for\nassuring the performance and reliability of aerospace com-\nponents, and have contributed to the success of many space\nmissions. The requirements for materials and processes to\nmeet the levels of quality assurance and control imposed by\naerospace industry and agencies are defined in specific\nstandards, e.g. ECSS-Q-ST-70C and NASA-STD- (I)-6016.\n\n9.5.1 Selection\n\nSelection of materials for space application requires\nknowledge of the relevant engineering properties and\nenvironments to be endured during the mission lifetime. In\nassessing the competence of a candidate material for a\nspecific use it is necessary to consider the associated pro-\ncess, targeted application, and respective environment.\nTherefore, properties such as specific strength and stiffness,\nfracture toughness, fatigue resistance, stress corrosion\nresistance, thermal resistance, sublimation, and erosion may\nbe relevant. Other selection criteria that may also be con-\nsidered are ease of manufacturing and ability to be repaired.\n\nSelected and applied materials in flight hardware must\nresist ground, launch, and on-orbit environments. Charac-\nterization of the performance in anticipated environments is\ntherefore essential. Recommended further reading can be\nfound in [15\u201317].\n\n9.5.2 Environmental Effects\n\nThe evolution of material properties in space is of primary\ninterest in the design of space vehicle structures. Under-\nstanding the space environment and the influence on the\nmaterials of degradation or even loss of performance\nthroughout the service lifetime, is of great importance. In\nthis context, countermeasures for thermal radiation, vacuum\nconditions, micrometeoroids, and space debris are important\ndesign parameters.\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 219\n\n\n\nThe expected temperature range of the structure is nor-\nmally also an important factor. Looking to the extreme\ntemperatures, the materials selection will yield different\nresults for cryogenic tanks on the one hand and on the\nsupporting structure of the thermal protection system of\nreentry vehicles on the other. Temperature variations within\nthe structure may cause unwanted thermal distortions. Many\nthermal cycles from low temperature to high temperature\nare of importance in the verification process. This is also\nimportant in composite materials, due to the different\nthermal responses of the fibers and the matrix.\n\nThe occurrence of atomic oxygen, corrosive environ-\nments, fluid compatibility issues, vacuum outgassing,\nmoisture effects (absorption/desorption) etc., occurring\nunder specific circumstances, all require proper attention.\nSelecting the most suitable material for a certain application\nis not always straightforward. In many cases, it is even\npossible to have more than one solution.\n\n9.5.3 Metallic Alloys: General\n\nMetallic alloys have been the primary choice since the early\ndays of space exploration. A variety of aluminum alloys,\nranging from 7020 for welded structures to 2000 (2024) and\n6000 (6061/6063) series plus 7075 for un-welded applica-\ntions, have been used predominantly. Aluminum alloys are\noften used in plate, shell structures, truss elements, face\nsheets, and the core of sandwich structures. For structural\nparts that are subjected to very demanding thermal envi-\nronments (e.g. nozzle parts, etc.) conventional titanium\nalloys were the natural choice. High-strength titanium\nalloys are applied in heavy load-carrying structures such as\nattachment fittings, fasteners, and pressure vessels. High-\nstrength steels are used in support structures and solid\nrocket motor cases.\n\n9.5.4 Advanced Metallic Alloys\n\nOver the years, the stringent requirements imposed by the\never more competitive aerospace industry and the increased\ndemand for lighter and stiffer structures have stimulated\ntechnology and research parties to seek advanced material\nsolutions. The effects have been visible in the paths fol-\nlowed by industry in terms of research, which came up with\ninnovative solutions, and even in terms of manufacturing\nstrategies, where low-cost manufacturing and unitized\n(cheaper to assembly) parts are gaining more importance.\nMaterials with enhanced mechanical behavior, optimized\nperformance, lower density and, at the same time more cost-\neffective, have emerged.\n\nSome development trends are easily identified. Research\non aluminum alloys is progressing on different levels,\nranging from improved-strength properties (e.g. zinc alu-\nminum alloys, Al-Zn, and alloys of aluminum and lithium,\nAl\u2013Li) to damage tolerance improvements (e.g. aluminum-\ncopper, Al-Cu, and Al\u2013Li alloys) or even the development of\nhigh-temperature aluminum alloys. In reality, a new gener-\nation of Al\u2013Li alloys are conquering the aerospace market.\nThese low-density alloys are attractive to the aerospace\nindustry due to their substantial reduction of mass, improved\nstiffness, and good welding properties. In addition, these\nalloys present very good resistance against fatigue crack\ngrowth, and are therefore suitable for critical components\nthat demand good damage tolerance. The application of Al\u2013\nLi alloys is very profitable because production costs are low\ncompared to the high investments to set up a fiber-reinforced\ncomposites production line. For further information fol-\nlowing references are of interest [18, 19].\n\n9.5.5 Composites\n\nA composite material is composed of at least two elements,\nwith the fibers and the matrix working together. The\nmechanical properties of engineering materials usually\ndepend on the number of defects within the structure of the\nmaterial, and are much lower than theory would predict. It\nhas been found that fine particles and fibers have properties\nmuch closer to their theoretical maximum. For instance, the\ntensile strength of pure silica glass is about 50 MPa, but in\nthe form of a fiber the tensile strength could be in excess of\n1,400 MPa. In order to utilize these properties the applied\nload should be transferred, via its matrix, to the embedded\nfiber reinforcement\n\nThe major composite classes include polymer matrix\ncomposites (PMC), metal-matrix composites (MMC) and\nceramic matrix composites (CMC). Further, composites can\nbe classified according to the reinforcement form\u2014parti-\ncles, platelets, whisker or short fibers, or continuous fiber\n(uni-directional, UD, laminated or woven composites;\nincluding braided, knitted and tri-axial architectures).\n\u2022 PMCs consist of polymer-based resin (thermoset or\n\nthermoplastic) as the matrix, and a variety of fibers such\nas glass, carbon, and aramid as the reinforcement.\n\n\u2022 MMCs consist of a metal such as aluminum as the matrix\nand are reinforced with fibers or particles that can resist\nthe manufacturing process such as silicon carbide or high\nmelting-point metal.\n\n\u2022 CMCs are mainly used in very demanding applications\n(high-temperature environments, high stability). The\nmost common are carbon and/or silicon carbide matrices\nreinforced with carbon fibers. Other applications require\ncomposites systems such as a ceramic as the matrix\n\n220 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\nreinforced with short fibers or whiskers such as those\nmade from silicon carbide and boron nitride.\nThe most widely used composite materials for space\n\napplications are PMCs with continuous fiber reinforcement\nand an epoxy or cyanate ester matrix (thermosetting resins).\nWithin each of the groups defined above, a large variety of\nfiber and resin systems are available, for example many\ndifferent glass fiber and carbon fiber products exist, each\nwith specific characteristics and properties.\n\nComposite materials are extensively used in the space\nindustry, mainly in the form of carbon fiber reinforced\nplastics/polymers (CFRP). Carbon fibers either as single\nfiber bundles, known as tows, or as woven mats are\nimpregnated with organic resins to form strong, stiff, and\nstable structures. These may be used as structural elements,\nsolar panels, antennas and mirror supporting structures. The\norientation of the fibers within the material structure allows\nexceptional control of the properties, and modern compos-\nites are approaching the theoretical strength limits for the\nmaterial combinations.\n\nTypically, two types of carbon fibers exist, PAN or\nPITCH, depending on their precursor materials. PAN fibers\ncome in two forms: high strength and high modulus. Both\nforms are based on polyacrylonitrile (hence PAN) but the\ndetails of the graphitization processes vary to give the\nrequired properties. PITCH-based fibers use spun petroleum\npitch fibers as a precursor. The fibers produced are not as\nstrong as PAN-based fibers but are exceptionally stiff; a\nmodulus of almost 1,000 GPa can be achieved in compar-\nison with almost 600 GPa for the best commercially\navailable PAN-based fibers. The PITCH-based fibers are\nbrittle and can break easily when bent, making handling and\nuse very difficult. In addition to high stiffness the PITCH-\nbased fibers have a very high thermal conductivity, which\nhas resulted in their use in thermal management systems\nwhere individual broken fibers are less of an issue. Typi-\ncally, the space industry uses PAN-based fibers with either\nhigh modulus for spacecraft or high strength for launchers.\n\nComposites are normally preferred in mass and stiffness\ndriven applications, such as primary structures (see\nFig. 9.28) and payload adapters. Most composites are\nformed using a thermosetting resin in combination with\nhigh stiffness carbon fibers. However, the use of thermo-\nplastic resins is emerging, and will likely become the ref-\nerence method for the matrix element within carbon fiber\nreinforced structures. Thermoplastic resins show better\nmechanical properties than thermosetting ones, although the\nmanufacturing of dimensionally accurate structural ele-\nments using this type of resin remains a challenge. The\nexcellent properties and potential mass savings make\ncomposites a very attractive solution for many applications.\nSpacecraft primary structures like platform panels, central\ntubes, and secondary structures like payload panels, sun-\nshields, antenna reflectors, and solar array substrates are\nmade of composite materials.\n\nThe range of applications for composites is extending,\nand nowadays they are also applied to pressure tanks,\neither in COPV form (composite overwrapped pressure\nvessels) or as composite tanks (e.g. for cryogenic appli-\ncations). Several developments are being investigated in\nthese areas, to identify possible concepts (e.g. simple skin,\nsandwich construction, multiwall) and overcome technical\ndifficulties such as compatibility issues, damage tolerance\nand health monitoring, thermal protection integration,\nreusability, etc.\n\nComposite materials offer new possibilities to associate\nfunction, complex forms, and materials, and to better satisfy\ncustomer requirements (weight, functional, etc.) where the\napplication of metallic materials is difficult. Composite\nmaterials have many functional advantages: lightness,\nmechanical strength, reduced maintenance, and complex\nforms. Thanks to their mechanical properties they allow an\nincreased lifetime for structures, and show a greater impact\nresistance. In addition, fiber composites allow considerable\nweight reductions of 10\u201320 % compared to classical\nmetallic materials due to the exploitation of anisotropy.\n\nFig. 9.28 Mecabus/Spacebus\n4000 Central Tube. Static load\ntest rig (left); schematic of central\ntube with north and south webs\n(center), image of central tube\n(right). Image RUAG\nThalesAlemia (left and center)\nand ESA (right)\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 221\n\n\n\nIn the field of aeronautics and space vehicle systems,\nmaterials used for structural applications are typically car-\nbon fibers and thermoset resin. The future use of carbon\nfibers and thermoplastic resins will further enhance the\nadvantage of composite materials for space structures as\ncompared to metallic ones, without leading to a prohibitive\ncost.\n\n9.5.5.1 Ceramics and Glass\nCeramic materials show very interesting mechanical prop-\nerties, such as high stiffness-to-mass ratio, good stability\n(due to the low coefficient of thermal expansion) and often\nhigh-temperature resistance. However, their brittleness and\nunforgiving behavior cannot be disregarded, and this drives\nmost of the mechanical design and verification process. The\nstrength of ceramic materials is very much dependent on the\nsurface condition and the distribution of (strength limiting)\nflaws. For this reason, there is a size effect to be accounted\nfor as ceramics exhibit sensitivity to the volume under\n(high) stresses. In addition, some ceramics are sensitive to\n\u2018slow crack growth\u2019 or \u2018static fatigue\u2019, which is a strength\ndegradation phenomenon that occurs under sustained load-\ning and in the presence of an aggressive environment (e.g.\nhumidity). Good stability and a high stiffness-to-mass ratio\nmakes ceramics an almost natural choice for optical struc-\ntures such as space telescopes, optical benches, mirrors, and\nscientific instruments.\n\nSiC 100 is a ceramic material produced by bonding sil-\nicon carbide (SiC) grains by sintering, and has been used in\na number of space missions. SiC has a rather low coefficient\nof thermal expansion and shows high stiffness down to\ncryogenic temperatures, which is ideal for large telescopes\nor stable optical benches at low operating temperatures.\nStructural components (optical bench, struts) can also be\nmanufactured using SiC. Note that SiC has isotropic prop-\nerties. Large temperature variations in a telescope made\ncompletely of SiC will not affect the optical performance.\nAdditionally, SiC is not susceptible to static fatigue. It has\nbeen used to build the telescopes of Herschel and Gaia\n(Fig. 9.29), both of which were state-of-the-art of large light\nweight, highly stable structures.\n\nCeSiC? is a ceramic material that incorporates fiber\nreinforcements. The type of fiber (specific fiber placement\nor chopped short fibers) will introduce non-isotropic char-\nacteristics. Flight representative demonstration models of\nrelatively large dimensions have already being manufac-\ntured. HB-CeSiC is made up of carbon fibre with silicon\ninfiltration, and is used for mirror applications.\n\nAn example of a more glass-like material is Zerodur.\nMost companies manufacturing space and ground-based\ntelescopes have extensive experience of manufacturing and\npolishing mirrors in Zerodur. Young\u2019s modulus and the\nstrength of Zerodur are relatively modest, so Zerodur\n\nmirrors are generally supported by a lightweight back\nstructure to reach a compromise between mass and stiffness.\nUsing an ultrasound milling machine and optimized\nmechanical design, specific weights as low as 40 kg/m2 can\nbe achieved. Lightweight Zerodur mirrors are still com-\npetitive with SiC for telescopes demanding image quality\nwith diameters up to 2-m, due to its lower cost, shorter\nmanufacturing schedule, and risks. The mass of a 2-m Ze-\nrodur mirror is approximately 150 kg, while offering both\ngood mechanical behavior and satisfactory image quality.\nHowever, glass-like materials such Zerodur show some\nlimitations\n\u2022 Low thermal conductivity and low Young\u2019s modulus\n\nlimit the potential mass-saving applications (the thermal\ncontrol axial gradient detrimental is for Earth\nobservation).\n\n\u2022 Time consuming manufacturing.\n\u2022 Joining of parts/segments.\n\u2022 The applicability of a honeycomb concept to large con-\n\ncave (or convex) mirrors still requires significant\ndevelopments.\n\nMoreover, the proven performance of some ceramics\nunder extreme temperatures, with some ceramics qualified\nto temperatures well above 1,200 ?C, makes this material\nvery suitable for thermal protection systems of reentry\nvehicles.\n\n9.6 Manufacturing and Assembly\nof Space Vehicle Structures\n\nManufacturing of structural parts varies depending on the\ntype of structure and the material used to build it.\n\n9.6.1 Metals\n\nMachining is the most frequently applied manufacturing\nmethod for metals. The process consists of removing\nmaterial by means of cutting, milling, drilling, or grinding\ntools. Most machining operations are automated and are\nsupported by CAD/CAM tools.\n\nForming is one of the most economical methods of\nfabrication. The most limiting aspect of designing formed\nparts is the bend radius, which must be large in order to\nlimit the amount of plastic strain in the material. Super-\nplastic forming and diffusion bonding, at temperatures up to\n1,000 ?C, can produce complex components but only for\ntitanium alloys since others are prone to surface oxidization\nthat inhibits the diffusion bonding. Spin forming has been\nsuccessfully applied for manufacturing aluminum pressure\nvessels.\n\n222 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\nForging, in which structural shapes are created by pres-\nsure, is well suited for massive parts such as load-intro-\nduction elements. Where large sheets have to be\nmanufactured (as for the skin of main thrust cylinders)\nchemical milling is frequently used in order to reduce the\nthickness of the sheet where possible. This process is more\nreliable than machining when processing very thin ele-\nments, but adequate tolerances have to allow for various\ninaccuracies as thickness variations of the original piece of\nmaterial are achieved by masking.\n\nCasting can be used to produce parts of complex shapes.\nHowever, the quality of a casting is difficult to control\nbecause gas bubbles can form as the material solidifies,\nresulting in porosity. Material strength and ductility are not\nas high as with most other processes. Also, the application\nof a high pressure to a metal structure, taking the internal\nparts to yield and resulting in internal compressive residual\nstresses after pressure relaxation, is a manufacturing method\nknown as autofrettage and is used to manufacture pressure\nvessels and other pressurized elements.\n\nFig. 9.29 The GAIA payload\nmodule. The 3-m diameter,\nquasi-octagonal torus supports\nthe two telescopes and the focal\nplane assembly, and is composed\nof 17 individual custom-built\nsilicon carbide segments (top);\nand the fully integrated GAIA\nproto-flight payload module\n(PLM) undergoing acceptance\nvibration testing on an\nelectrodynamic shaker at the\nfacilities of Interspace in\nToulouse, France (bottom).\nImage EADS Astrium\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 223\n\n\n\nRecently the implementation of additive manufacturing\n(AM) has opened a new possibility for the manufacturing of\ncomplex structural parts, either metallic or non-metallic.\n\n9.6.2 Composites\n\nThe processing of composites starts with raw materials\nrather than semi-finished products as for metals, hence it is\npossible to produce fairly complex parts as a single piece\n(unitization) and achieve savings on manufacturing and\nassembly costs. Impregnated tapes are the most widely used\nprecursor for composite manufacturing. Fibers can be\nwoven to form fabrics. The key parameters when specifying\nthe material are the types of fibers and resin, content, tack,\nand drape.\n\nThe fiber will control the major mechanical properties of\nthe part, such as its strength and stiffness. The resin, which\nbinds the fibers together, will determine the maximum\ntemperature under which the part can be safely used. It will\nalso influence moisture absorption and desorption, with\npossible effects on geometrical distortions under thermal\nand moisture cycling.\n\nTack is a measure of how much pre-preg sticks to it and\nto other layers. Pre-pregs that have too much tack can be\ndifficult to handle because misplaced layers are difficult to\nreposition without disrupting the resin or fiber direction.\nPre-pregs with little tack are difficult to keep in place as\nmore plies are applied. Lack of tack often indicates the pre-\npreg resin has cured beyond an acceptable limit, with the\nresult that the composite part will not cure properly.\n\nDrape is the ability of the pre-preg to form around con-\ntours and complex shapes. The fiber material and the diam-\neter of the filaments, as well as the cross-section of the tow,\ninfluence drape. It is also conditioned by the weaving pattern.\nFor flat panels a low tack and drape are acceptable, but for\ncomplex shapes and cavities, tack and drape keep the com-\nposite in place during laying-up and preparation for curing.\n\nManual lay-up is a costly technique, but it is well\nadapted for the production of single parts of very small\nseries. When the number of identical parts to be produced\nincreases, filament winding, resin transfer molding, and\nbraiding, are cost-effective alternatives.\n\nFilament winding consists of wrapping bands of con-\ntinuous fiber or strands or roving\u2019s over a mandrel in a\nsingle machine-controlled operation. A number of layers of\nthe same or different patterns are placed on the mandrel.\nThe fibers may be impregnated with the resin before\nwinding (wet winding), pre-impregnated (dry winding), or\npost-impregnated. The first two winding sequences are\nanalogous to wet or dry lay-up in the reinforced plastic\n\nfabrication methods. Curing the resin binder and removing\nthe mandrel completes the process. Machining or grinding\nis usually not necessary.\n\nResin transfer molding is a closed-mold low-pressure\nprocess. The fiber reinforcement is placed into a tool cavity,\nwhich is then closed. The dry reinforcement and the resin\nare combined within the mold to form the composite part.\nThis process allows the fabrication of composites ranging in\ncomplexity from simple, low-performance small parts to\ncomplex elements of large size. The advantages are a very\ngood surface finish and good tolerances. The significant cost\nof the mold is a drawback that often disqualifies the process\nfor small series production.\n\nIn braiding operation, a mandrel is fed through the center\nof a braiding machine at a uniform rate and the fibers or\nyarns from the carriers are braided around the mandrel at a\ncontrolled angle. The machine operates like a maypole, with\nthe carriers working in pairs to accomplish the over-and-\nunder braiding sequence. Parameters in the braiding oper-\nation include strand tension, mandrel feed rate, braider\nrotational speed, number of strands, width, and the perim-\neter being braided. Interlaced fibers result in stronger joints.\nApplications include lightweight ducts for aerospace\napplications.\n\nAutomated tape laying machines have been introduced\nprogressively in order to gain reliability and cost-benefits.\nToday this technology is mastered for the thermoset resins\nused in aeronautic and space structures. The Ariane 5 inter-\nstage structure and payload adapter are some examples.\nThermoset materials are used to a large extent, and often\ncomponents are manufactured using automated tape layer\nmachines and autoclaves. Restrictions arise, however, for\nvery large components due to the autoclave size.\n\nHigh-performance thermoplastic composite materials\nhave the potential to improve aeronautical structural effi-\nciency, and to reduce manufacturing and in-service costs.\nEvaluations for space applications have shown the utility of\nthese materials associated with an out-of-autoclave consoli-\ndation. Manufacturing of thermoplastic composites using\nautomated tape laying also has a great potential to reduce\nmanufacturing costs, schedule, and risks. Integrating heating\non the machine during lay-up and in situ consolidation would\nbe the next step to reduce manufacturing cycles and cost.\n\nFiber steering is a method of construction for fiber-\nreinforced composites that allows the unidirectional fibers\nto be aligned along curvilinear paths. An advanced tow\nplacement machine steers the fibers along the desired paths\nthrough computer-controlled trajectories. This allows\ndefining and controlling the stiffness, the density, and the\nCTE of a panel as a function of the direction and the\nlocation of the fibers.\n\n224 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\n9.6.3 Joining\n\nThe assembly of the different structural parts of a space\nvehicle is achieved by joining them to each other by fas-\ntening, riveting, bonding, welding, soldering, or brazing.\n\nFastening is a frequently used joining method. Torqueing\nis normally the method used to install a fastener, although\nthere are other methods in which the preload is applied by\nstretching the fastener without torqueing it. The installation\ntorque is the addition of the seating torque, which produces\nthe desired joint preload, and the running (also called\nlocking) torque implemented to avoid the fastener loosening\ndue to vibrations and suffering fatigue. A fastened joint can\nbe assembled and disassembled a few of times without\ncompromising the preload.\n\nRiveting is mostly used when the joint is designed to\ncarry mainly shear loads. Unlike fastened joints, riveted\njoints are less suited for disassembly.\n\nAdhesive bonding is used mainly to join composite or\nceramics elements. Joining is normally achieved by the use\nof thin adhesive films. Susceptibility to shock, vibration,\nand thermal loads must be considered in the design.\n\nJoining by welding is achieved by melting the two parts\nto be joined and adding a filler material to form a pool of\nmolten material that, after cooling, becomes a rather strong\njoint. However, when soldering or brazing two parts a\nlower-melting-point material is used between the parts to be\njoined without melting them. The residual stresses that are\nbuilt in during cooling after welding, soldering, or brazing\ncould be relevant in magnitude and must be considered in\nthe verification of the joint or decreased (e.g. by thermal\ntreatment).\n\n9.7 Space Vehicle Mechanisms\n\nMechanisms are essential for achieving various functions of\na spacecraft mission, such as deployment of appendages,\nhigh stability pointing and scanning, reaction and momen-\ntum wheels, robotics and exploration tools, to name a few.\nIn addition, mechanisms are implemented in launchers and\nreentry vehicles for thrust control, actuation of control\nsurfaces and landing systems.\n\nIn space vehicles, mechanisms are generally not redun-\ndant and are therefore considered to be single points of\nfailure. Furthermore, often the operation of a mechanism\noccurs in a harsh environment, and after a long period of\nstorage or after along flight, so they require a careful and\nrobust design and verification process in order to achieve\nthe necessary reliability.\n\n9.7.1 AOCS Sensors and Actuators\n\nWith modern attitude control subsystems, there is a large\nvariety of sensors available to provide the necessary mea-\nsurement signals such as spacecraft angular position, rate\nand acceleration. Typical examples are star trackers, Sun &\nEarth sensors, rate/integrating gyroscopes (gyros), acceler-\nometers, magnetometers, and combined/multi-axis sensor\nequipment like inertial measurements units (IMU). Fur-\nthermore, specialized optical sensors and cameras are also\nused for navigation purposes.\n\nIn the early 1990s, many gyros were still based on\nmechanical technology, essentially floating gyros and\ndynamically (or dry) tuned gyros (DTG). However due to\nreliability problems, most sensors are not based on \u2018classi-\ncal\u2019 mechanical operating principles anymore, for instance\nfiber optical gyros (FOG) or hemispherical resonating gyros\n(HRG). Nevertheless, certain functions in the design of\nindividual sensor types cannot be accomplished without\ndedicated mechanisms, for instance the scanning mirror\nassembly of Earth sensors or caging mechanisms for proof\nmass based accelerometers. Such special-purpose acceler-\nometers may also form a scientific payload, as is the LISA\nPathfinder spacecraft , sometimes with sophisticated com-\npensation of magnetic field effects. In addition, it is worth\nnoticing that micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) are\nutilized for sensors where adequate, e.g. in MEMS gyros.\n\n9.7.1.1 Reaction and Momentum Wheels\nIn many spacecraft, reaction and momentum wheels are\nused as actuators for attitude control. Reaction wheels are\ndesigned to operate over a wide speed range, including\nspeed reversals. By controlled acceleration or deceleration\nof the wheel, a reaction torque is applied on the spacecraft\nplatform for the controlled exchange of angular momentum\nbetween the satellite and the wheel. By this approach, slew\nmaneuvers and attitude stabilization via the rejection of\nexternal disturbance torques can be performed. Momentum\nwheels are typically operated at a fixed or nearly fixed\nspeed, and are used to provide a momentum bias to a\nspacecraft to ensure gyroscopic stabilization.\n\nA set of three reaction wheels mounted in an orthogonal\nconfiguration can provide attitude control about all three\naxes of a spacecraft. However, often a skewed configuration\nof four wheels is used to build in adequate failure tolerance\nat the system level against the malfunction of any single\nreaction wheel in the set. In accordance with needs for\nspacecraft of different types and sizes, there is a large range\nof wheel products in terms of angular momentum capacity\nand reaction torque.\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 225\n\n\n\nThe main subassemblies of reaction and momentum\nwheels comprise an inertia rotor, a bearing unit for rotor\nsuspension, an electric motor with the associated drive,\ncontrol & interface electronics, a housing with the\nmechanical and electrical interfaces, and auxiliary parts\nsuch as sensors for monitoring purposes. The electric motor\nto drive the wheel is often implemented as a brushless DC\nmotor. The inertia rotor comprises a carefully balanced\nmass in some rotationally symmetric shape. In most wheel\ndesigns, it is suspended by precision ball bearings.\n\nThere have been various development activities on\nmagnetic bearing suspension, and a number of operational\nspacecraft use magnetic bearing wheels. However, because\nof the added design complexity, cost, difficulties with\nground testing, and other aspects, they have not been\ncommercially attractive up to now and have been limited to\nmissions such as Earth observation spacecraft. Wheel\ntechnology development is pursued in response to the\nrequirements for present and future attitude control systems\nand space missions and includes advanced wheel internal\ncontrol schemes, drive electronics with increased perfor-\nmance and alternative tele command & telemetry interfaces,\nand the reduction of wheel-induced micro-disturbances.\n\n9.7.1.2 Control Moment Gyroscopes\nControl moment gyroscopes (CMG) have been applied for\nattitude control on large spacecraft such as space stations\nand military satellites. There is now also an increasing\ninterest in CMGs for agile spacecraft, e.g. civilian Earth\nobservation missions. They offer the opportunity to reduce\npayload mass and complexity, in particular when develop-\ning a medium-size spacecraft (up to about 1,000 kg) with\nhigh maneuverability.\n\nCMGs comprise a flywheel (usually with constant\nangular momentum), accommodated on a gimbal structure.\nSingle and double gimbal configurations have been used.\nHowever, most of the presently developed CMGs are single\ngimbal configurations, mainly to avoid complexity.\n\nA gimbal actuator rotates the spin axis of the flywheel,\nwhich results in a gyroscopic output torque. This torque is\nproportional to the flywheel momentum multiplied by the\ngimbal rotation rate. Therefore, CMGs are particularly\nsuited as high-torque actuators that enable high slew rates of\na space platform. For instance, using a reaction wheel with\n15 Nms installed momentum and rotating it about the\ngimbal axis at 3 rad/s, a torque of 45 Nm can be achieved.\nThis output torque level is effectively more than 100 times\nlarger than the typical torque capability of the same wheel\nin a conventional reaction wheel configuration. However, it\nwas necessary to develop sophisticated attitude control\nalgorithms, in particular to avoid singularity configurations\nwith multiple CMGs (see also Chap. 12).\n\nTechnology development for future applications is\nfocused on even more compact CMGs for spacecraft below\n500 kg, on the reduction of micro-disturbances (mainly\ncaused by flywheel rotation), and further improvement of\nsubassemblies such as the control, drive, and interface\nelectronics.\n\n9.7.2 Electrical Motors\n\nAn electrical motor is the combination of an electrome-\nchanical converter and its controller. There are many types of\nelectric motors. The most relevant for space applications are\n\u2022 Electromagnetic motors\n\n\u2013 Brushed DC motors (including brush equivalent\nconcepts)\n\n\u2013 Brushless DC motors\n\u2013 Stepper motors\n\u2013 Voice Coil motors\n\n\u2022 Non electromagnetic motors\n\u2013 Piezo-electric motors and other (often non-magnetic)\n\nworking principles, including those used in micro-\ntechnology.\n\nThe commonly named electrical motor is a device\ncapable of providing elementary motion along one axis\nwithin a mechanism. It is a complex assembly of many\ncomponents. Each component has its own particular tech-\nnology, but the most fundamental is the frameless electrical\nmotor. The electromechanical converter is composed of a\nmotor integrated to a speed reduction device to provide\nmotion along one axis with the required energy and speed.\nThis motion can be rotational or linear. The main compo-\nnents of an integrated motor are typically a frameless\nelectrical motor mounted in its housing, a bearing assembly,\nand a shaft. A phase commutation device or a position\nmeasurement sensor might also be necessary.\n\nThe frameless electrical motor comprises a fixed stator\nand a moving rotor. The rotor may be internal or external.\nOther variants are also possible, such as an axial gap with a\ndisk shape rotor and stator. The most common motor is\nnevertheless the configuration with an external stator with\nwindings, combined with a rotor equipped with magnets\nmounted on the output shaft of the motor. The shaft rotation\nis guided by the bearing assembly, which is most commonly\nachieved by a pair of preloaded ball bearings.\n\nDifferent types of bearing assemblies can be used for\nspace applications, including ball bearings, and magnetic\nand hydrodynamic suspensions. Each of these requires\nspecific tribological solutions, consistent with space\nrequirements.\n\nOne of the major motor cost drivers, and one of the main\ntrade-off parameters for the space mechanism designer, is\nthe motor controller. It provides the motor windings with\n\n226 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_12\n\n\nthe required current in order to generate the motion. The\ncontroller can be a simple DC voltage provider, usually\nincluding a current limiter, or a complex and expensive\nelectrical power provider, incorporating numerous func-\ntionalities. The controller also includes all the software\nrequired by the mechanism\u2019s movement during the release\nand operational mission phases. To simplify the architecture\nof a motor controller, it is possible to consider it as being\ncomposed of two different parts: the high power part (the\npower supply) and the low power part (the signal elec-\ntronics). The latter covers the commutation, sensor and\ncommand signals. The power stage provides the current,\nand hence the power, to the motor with the appropriate\nphases (e.g. 2- or 3-phase). The power stage of the con-\ntroller interfaces with the motor windings (in most cases,\nwith the stator).\n\nThe fundamental and specific electrical motor know-how\nis the capability to design a frameless motor and identify the\nassociated power supply requirements. The remaining\nmotor technologies are encountered in any mechanism, and\nare therefore not necessarily specific to electrical motors.\nThese include bearings, tribology and electronics design.\nDue to this complexity, it is a significant challenge for the\nspace mechanism designer to select and procure a tech-\nnology that will be optimal in terms of motor concepts,\nperformance, reliability, with materials suitable for space\napplications, and also compatible with the application\nschedule and overall costs.\n\nDepending on the motor\u2019s magnetic concept, the way in\nwhich an electrical motor brings about mechanical motion\nto a mobile payload can be radically different. To simplify\nthe understanding of these differences, it can be stated that\nsome motors are intended to provide forces, while others\nprovide positioning as a function of time. The brushless DC\nmotor is a typical example of the first category, while the\nstepper motor falls under the second. There are other types\nof electrical motor technologies, such as the variable\nreluctance stepper motor, or the induction motor, as well as\nother varieties that produce linear instead of rotational\nmotion.\n\nElectric motors for space, within motor technology in\ngeneral, exploit electromagnetic and non-electromagnetic\noperational principles. Of these two main families of elec-\ntric motors and actuators, the most important and most\nconventional are the electromagnetic group of devices.\nHowever, the rapid introduction of piezo systems into\ndiverse terrestrial applications means that they must be\nconsidered, because some of their characteristics make them\nattractive for space applications. In this vein, it is important\nto mention en passant magnetostrictive devices, which are\nsimilar in characteristics in many ways to piezo systems.\n\nThere is a strong trend of development and diversity in\npiezo electric motors and piezo actuators. Motors ranging\n\nfrom nano-scale to several cubic centimeters in volume are\navailable in a wide variety of shapes and configurations.\nThe industrial demand for small, lightweight motors in\nportable technologies will continue to stimulate research\nand development of new piezo motor designs; although\nadaptation and qualification will be required before this\ntechnology can be used for space applications. Piezo actu-\nators seem ideally suited to sub-miniature mechanisms,\nwhich is a niche of space applications. However, piezo\nmotors have much lower efficiency, and shorter lifetime\nthan electromagnetic counterparts. Furthermore, piezo\nactuators are not seen as a general replacement for small\nelectromagnetic motors, but as solution to specific small-\nscale actuator applications.\n\nElectrical motors are currently present in a very large\nnumber of terrestrial applications: their annual production is\nin the order of millions of units, while electrical motors\nflown in space are around several hundred units per year.\nTherefore, it is clear that the main technology developments\nin this field come from terrestrial applications. However,\nsome specific product adaptations have been made to fulfill\nthe particular requirements of space applications.\n\nOngoing improvements of the technology should increase\nthe power/mass and power/volume ratios, improve effi-\nciency, reduce noise and vibrations, increase speed ranges,\nand increase reliability. Any exceptions to this should come\nfrom the developments required for specific applications,\nsuch as extreme-temperature motors, motors operating in\ncorrosive environments, etc. Nevertheless, new industrial\napplications of electrical motors, like the following ones,\nmight stimulate motor improvements in new technology\nareas that would be beneficial to space applications.\n\u2022 Environmental and climate concerns are stimulating a\n\nresurgence in interest in electric motor design. Particular\ninterest is being shown in designs for solar powered\nvehicles and electric and hybrid cars. The electric motor\nis being viewed as a system, in which the controller\nelectronics, the motor efficiency, and the matching of the\nload to the motor must all be improved and optimized in\norder to increase system efficiency.\n\n\u2022 One of the newest and most vigorous trends is in motor\ncontroller electronics for permanent magnet motors,\nswitched reluctance motors, and hybrid systems. This\nwill allow huge flexibility of both speed of operation and\nfrequency of operation.\n\n\u2022 Advances in high-purity steels, new permanent magnet\nmaterials, soft magnetic materials and conductors and\ninsulation are making possible many new construction\ngeometries and designs.\n\n\u2022 Superconducting motors should soon be feasible thanks\nto new fabrication methods for making high-temperature\nsuperconductors (HTS) into flexible wires suitable for\nwinding coils. With transition temperatures now up\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 227\n\n\n\nto *90 K, cooling is within the range of liquid nitrogen\nand cryocoolers.\n\n\u2022 There is a trend to smaller, high-speed motors, exploiting\npower = torque x speed. This is becoming evident in\ndomestic appliances such as vacuum cleaners and cord-\nless drills, which use small motors running at\n100,000 rpm, with appropriate gearing.\n\n\u2022 Fault-tolerant motor systems are developing well for space\napplications, especially for launchers, in synergy with the\nneeds of the aviation industry and the military. Mean time\nbetween failures of motor systems such as for aircraft flap\ncontrol are believed to be *105 h (i.e. about 12 years).\n\n\u2022 In this respect there is a trend to replace hydraulic sys-\ntems of launchers by electrical systems (as has been done\nfor the flap control in the aviation industry with fault\ntolerant electric motors) in order to save weight and\nincrease reliability.\n\n\u2022 There is a trend to develop high-temperature motors. This\nallows the use of electric motors actually inside jet\nengines, and in the hot areas of, for example, car engines.\nContinuous operation at above 350 ?C is required for in-\nengine applications in aviation.\n\n\u2022 There is steady progress in low-temperature motors,\nalthough issues remain regarding bearings, lubricants,\nand materials.\n\n9.7.3 Pointing Mechanisms\n\n9.7.3.1 Electric Propulsion Pointing Mechanisms\nIn order to optimize electric thruster propellant resources, to\nlimit the number of electric thrusters on a platform, and to\nperform advanced attitude and orbit maneuvers, electric\npropulsion pointing mechanism (EPPM) are required. EP-\nPMs are used on the majority of the spacecraft using electric\nthrusters with a power consumption [1 kW. Their main\nfunctions are\n\u2022 To accommodate and support electric thrusters during\n\nground, launch, and on-orbit activities.\n\u2022 To secure during launch the electric thrusters in a stowed\n\nconfiguration.\n\u2022 To allow on-orbit multi-axis pointing capabilities of the\n\nthrust vector(s) of the operational and redundant (when\napplicable) thrusters under the control of the attitude and\norbit control system (AOCS).\n\n\u2022 To provide a dynamic transfer function compatible with\nthe thruster allowable mechanical loads of a thruster.\n\n\u2022 To provide a thermal design compatible with thruster and\nplatform thermal requirements during both the opera-\ntional and non-operational modes of a thruster.\n\n\u2022 To accommodate and route the electrical harness and\npipes around each rotational axis to ensure adequate\nmargins of life and torque.\n\n\u2022 To accommodate electric propulsion system (EPS)\nancillary equipment (e.g. a hot interface box, xenon flow\ncontrol unit).\nGenerally, EPPMs are composed of the following\n\nelements\n\u2022 A mobile plate supporting one or two thrusters, and\n\nthruster interface shims (if any).\n\u2022 A multi-axis (generally two) pointing assembly including\n\ndrive units and a kinematics assembly.\n\u2022 A sensor unit, the complexity of which depends on the\n\nAOCS control logic.\n\u2022 A hold down and release mechanism.\n\u2022 A flexible thruster supply lines assembly, including sup-\n\nports and protection from radiations a new responsibility\nof EPPM suppliers.\n\n\u2022 A damping system due to the high sensitivity of electrical\nthrusters to vibrations and shocks.\n\n\u2022 Tailored mechanical and thermal interfaces with the\nthruster(s) and ancillary equipment.\n\n\u2022 Supports for EPS equipment.\n\u2022 Passive and active thermal hardware.\n\nThe main technical challenges in the design and devel-\nopment of EPPMs are\n\u2022 To minimize the mechanical environment at thruster\n\ninterfaces.\n\u2022 To operate under a stringent thermal environment.\n\u2022 To allow the routing and flexibility of thruster supply lines.\n\nEPPMs must be considered as an enabling technology in\norder to maximize the performances of electric propulsion\nsystems. EPPMs developments in Europe were initiated in\nthe early 1990s as electric propulsion was identified as the\nmost promising technology to provide the specific impulse\nneeded for future telecommunication, science, and even\nsome crewed missions.\n\nThe recent history of electrical propulsion systems has\nbeen paved by successes of the Artemis and SMART-1\nspacecraft and the Eurostar platform, by the consolidation\ninto reliable system of both the Snecma and Fakel PPS\nthrusters, and also by the in-orbit degradation observed in\nBoeing commercial telecom satellites.\n\nThe new generation of electric thrusters offer enhanced\nthrust capabilities that enable more spacecraft maneuvers to\nbe achieved using electric propulsion. This requires exten-\nded functional performances of the pointing mechanisms,\nincluding complete reorientation of the thrusters in order to\nachieve various spacecraft propulsion scenarios.\n\nThe future objectives are to extend EPPMs and then EPS\ncapabilities in order to achieve momentum wheels damping,\neast\u2013west station-keeping, orbit top-up, and potentially orbit\nraising/transfer, orbit inclination changing, and graveyard\nmaneuvers. Future EPPMs will have to accommodate the\nhigh-power electric thrusters (typically [5 kW) which are\nmore than twice as heavy, provide improved thermal\n\n228 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\nmanagement capabilities, accommodate stiffer fuel and\nelectric lines, and operate for higher numbers of cycles and\ncumulated angle. High power and voltage cables are con-\nsidered as being the driver. However, one of the major\nenhancements will lie in generating very low dynamic\namplification in order to guarantee the thrusters\u2019 integrity\nduring launch and shock-generating operations, and in\nincreasing dramatically their pointing range capabilities.\n\n9.7.3.2 Coarse Pointing Assemblies for Optical\nTerminals\n\nThe coarse pointing assembly (CPA) is in essence a two-\naxis pointing system. It comprises a gimbaled mirror driven\nby independent elevation and azimuth scanning units. Sta-\nbility is the keyword for the design of the CPA. It must\nsupport the mirror without inducing any stresses mechanical\nor thermal. It must not be sensitive to micro-vibrations\noriginating from the host spacecraft, and it must offer a\nstable optical platform when rotating the mirror (i.e. a\nsmooth well-damped motion).\n\nThe CPA is part of the optical head, the primary function\nof which is to provide the beam steering and realize a free-\nspace optical link. The other major units within the optical\nhead are the telescope, optical, bench and the fine pointing\nassembly. The primary role of the CPA within this system is\nto point the terminal (beam) towards the partner satellite,\ncompensating for low rate disturbances and drift.\n\n9.7.3.3 Antenna Pointing Mechanisms (APMs)\nPointing mechanisms are needed to ensure correct align-\nment between antenna terminals to guarantee an efficient\nradio frequency link, either for a space-to-Earth link or for\nan inter-orbit link. Typically, entire antennas or major ele-\nments (like the reflector dish or the antenna radiating horn)\nneed to be oriented in a prescribed direction as requested by\nthe antenna pointing system (APS), and electrically imple-\nmented via the antenna pointing electronics (APE). Angular\nmotion normally includes two degrees of freedom, since\n\nrotation around antenna bore sight does not normally need\nto be actively controlled.\n\nTypical mechanical architectures to implement the two\ndegrees of freedom angular motion are\n\u2022 elevation/azimuth rotary stages (normally in a elevation\n\nover azimuth configuration) capable of large, quasi-\nhemispherical angular pointing coverage.\n\n\u2022 gimbaled pivot point with two linear actuators acting as\nan offset lever arm for smaller angular ranges.\nAn example of a gimbaled antenna pointing mechanism\n\nis shown in Fig. 9.30, from NASA\u2019s Mars Science Labo-\nratory.It provides communication with Earth on the X-band,\nwithout intermediate links.\n\nAPMs can constitute an (unnecessary) load-carrying path\nduring launch phases, when the antenna is in its stowed\nconfiguration. Consequently, the overall antenna mechanical\narchitecture needs to be carefully conceived to avoid\nexcessive loading at critical locations (like in the APM\nbearings) due to hyperstaticity. Particularly critical is the\ninteraction with the hold-down and release mechanisms, and\nto prevent excessive shock loads at separation reaching\nsensitive APM components. A typical APM configuration\nincludes (for each rotary stage)\n\u2022 Main bearings to implement the rotational motion\n\u2022 Gear stage to couple the actuator to the APM output shaft\n\u2022 Actuator, typically stepper motors typically with integral\n\ngear-head\n\u2022 Angular position sensor\n\u2022 Twist capsule or cable wraps\n\u2022 Thermal hardware for temperature control.\n\nIn order to transfer the signal/power cables through the\nAPM rotational stages, twist capsules can be used. Since in\nmost cases there is also a need to transfer a radio frequency\nsignal, an APM might include hollow shafts, through which\nradio frequency rotary joints are implemented. This is par-\nticularly true for high-frequency applications (from X-band\nup to Ka-band and higher) where coaxial cables would not\nbe an option due to high losses. For limited angular motion\n\nFig. 9.30 High gain antenna,\nincluding gimbal pointing\nmechanism built by SENER for\nthe Mars Science Laboratory.\nImage EADS Astrium\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 229\n\n\n\n(typically when gimbaled antennas plus linear actuator are\nused) the radio frequency signal can be transferred by\nmeans of sections of flexible wave-guides, which become an\nintegral part of the APM due to their strong implications in\nterms of parasitic torques and life capabilities.\n\nMain design drivers for the APMs include\n\u2022 Pointing accuracy, available to \\20 arc-seconds\n\u2022 Operational life, normally 15 years for telecommunica-\n\ntion applications\n\u2022 Stiffness, strongly linked to the payload inertia, but\n\ngenerally targeting frequencies above 2.5 Hz.\nCrucial in the APM design is the compromise between\n\nstiffness and resistive torque due to the pre-load on the main\nbearings. Indeed a high bearing pre-load is desirable from\nthe stiffness point of view and also to prevent gapping under\nvibration loads, but the high friction resistance torque limits\nthe useful life. Developments in the direction of a variable\nbearing pre-load system are thus pursued in order to inde-\npendently optimize the main bearing pre-load for the two\ndifferent cases (stowed and operational).\n\nPointing ranges vary from a few degrees for fine pointing\nof telecommunication antennas, to about 12 degrees half-\ncone for inter-orbit link applications, to full 360? rotation\nfor scientific missions.\n\nSimulations of the entire dynamic chain, including APM\nand operated payload, are performed in order to avoid\ndynamic coupling and resonances between the structural\nelements and the APM generated forces/torques, which\nwould be detrimental to the final pointing performance.\n\nWhen stepper motors are used as actuators (as in the\nmajority of cases) to limit APM generated micro-vibrations,\ntechniques known as micro-stepping are implemented by\nmeans of a dedicated electronic design.\n\nOperational temperatures ranging from approximately\n-40 ?C to +60 ?C are also critical for the design and sizing of\ninner components and particularly for the main bearing. Heat\ntransfer through the APM is a concern because it generates\ntemperature gradients through the main bearing, thus altering\nsubstantially the as-designed pre-load. A non-appropriate\nthermal design might cause: loss of stiffness, reduced life-\ntime, and severe malfunction due to excessive friction torque.\nA dedicated heater can limit the minimum temperature case\n(sometimes the motor self-heating capability is exploited for\nthis purposes).\n\n9.7.4 Hold-Down and Separation Systems\n\nMost spacecraft have appendages (solar arrays, antenna\nreflectors, radiators, instruments, doors, sensors, booms,\netc.) that are held stowed in order to fit into the launcher\u2019s\navailable volume and to survive the launch loads and then\ndeployed in orbit to their operating position.\n\nOther equipment like scanning/refocusing mechanisms,\nelectric propulsion pointing mechanisms or coarse pointing\nmechanisms must be stowed during launch and then\nreleased in order to allow in-orbit operations without any\nspecific deployment.\n\nTo achieve these functions, two different types of\nmechanisms are used one after the other: the hold-down and\nrelease mechanisms (HDRM) and the deployment mecha-\nnisms (DM).\n\nThe hold down and release mechanisms are standard\ncomponents for spacecraft in order to achieve mission-\nrelated critical functions. Their main functions are to secure\nduring launch and to release once in orbit (or during descent\nto, or after landing on, a planetary surface) movable payload\nitems, deployable appendages and separable mission ele-\nments. They can also be used to achieve timely synchro-\nnization for the deployment and/or ejection of specific\nappendages or separable mission elements.\n\nThe deployment mechanisms are used to enable\ndeployment of a released appendage from its stowed posi-\ntion to its operational position by way of a defined kine-\nmatics and passive to active controlled dynamics. Once the\nfinal position is reached, the appendage is either latched at a\ndefined position or the DM is used as a re-pointing or\ntrimming device to achieve specific mission related func-\ntions. In some cases, HDRMs are not used in conjunction\nwith DMs. This is, for instance, the case for scanning and\nrefocusing mechanisms, electric propulsion pointing\nmechanisms and ejection mechanisms. Concerning HDRMs\nfor spacecraft applications, they are generally composed of\nthree functional elements\n\u2022 A hold down preloading assembly (HDPA) such as a bolt,\n\nnut, threaded rod, tie-rod, cam/lever, cable, or rope which\nprovides the required preload to be applied via manual\noperation or the use of specific ground support equipment\nin order to secure the equipment in stowed configuration\nduring launch.\n\n\u2022 Hold down release actuator (HDRA) which achieves the\nrelease of the preload upon the command of a drive\nelectronic. The release actuator is generally mounted on\nthe fixed part of the separable interface. It also frees and\nsecures the separable interface from any mechanical links\nand, prevents any interference on deployment or opera-\ntion of the appendage. For some applications, the bolt or\nthreaded rod is ejected upon release and secured into a so-\ncalled bolt catcher via a dedicated spring and/or the\nstored strain energy.\n\n\u2022 Hold down load carrying structure (HDLCS) which\nguarantees the launch loads transmissibility between the\nfixed part and the part to be released. This element\ncompletes the HDRM assembly and is always adapted to\neach appendage and spacecraft interface.\n\n230 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\nHDRAs usually rely on one of the following\ntechnologies\n\u2022 Pyrotechnic devices (release nuts/bolt cutter, separation\n\nnut, cutters, brazing melt, wire cutter, cable cutter)\n\u2022 Split spool devices (fusible wire, SMA wires)\n\u2022 Solenoid actuated nuts\n\u2022 SMA triggered release nuts, with a temperature range of\n\n-60 ?C/+70 ?C\n\u2022 SMA actuators (pin pullers/pushers) with a range of -\n\n60 ?C/+70 ?C\n\u2022 Paraffin actuators (pin pullers/pushers) with a range of\n\n-60 ?C/+80 ?C\n\u2022 Electro-magnetic/solenoid or piezo actuated pin puller/\n\npusher actuators\n\u2022 Electromagnets/magnetic clamps\n\u2022 Thermal cutters/knife.\n\nThe HDRA can be located either in the load path or in a\nremote position and act via a cam/lever assembly. In this\ncase, it is used as a trigger to initiate the release. Due to the\ngenerally external location of the HDRA, they must\nwithstand a large temperature range, typically -100 ?C/\n+120 ?C for most of the applications. Shape memory alloy\nand paraffin based technologies do not meet this tempera-\nture range, but can generate very low release shocks and can\nbe used as triggers. It has to be mentioned that reusability is\nsometimes associated with lower reliability, as the number\nof parts in a reusable device is significantly higher than for a\npartially or non-reusable one. The underlying technologies\ncan be grouped according to the level of reusability, which\nis a key feature with respect to HDRA implementation in\nspace systems, as shown in Table 9.4.\n\nIn order to classify the different technologies, the HDRA\ncould be divided into five categories with respect to their\nshock response spectrum peak upon operation\n\u2022 High ([3,000 g)\n\u2022 Medium (between 1,000 and 3,000 g)\n\u2022 Low (between 300 and 1,000 g)\n\u2022 Ultra-low (\\300 g)\n\u2022 No-shocks (indeterminately low).\n\nIn order to provide consistent, comparable, and recog-\nnized test data, the evaluation of release shocks requires\napproved and standard test procedures and facilities. For all\nHDRMs, the tightening tension can be settled and checked\nwith different manners\n\u2022 Flight torque or force sensors\n\u2022 Tooling (on the ground) torque or force sensors\n\u2022 Torque controlled screwing\n\u2022 Angle controlled screwing.\n\nUsually, the preload versus torque relationship is not\nwell mastered by most of HDRM users. In most HDRMs,\nthe actual tightening tension (minimal guaranteed preload),\nonce the preload is applied, can hardly be known without\nthe use of external force sensing devices, e.g. load cells or\nstrain gauges. Users often rely on the preload versus torque\nrelationship, which cannot guarantee a preload value\naccurate enough for space applications associated with the\nrequired repeatability.Historically, the high shock level\ngenerated by the release of the HDRA has been tolerated\ndue to the following measures\n\u2022 Definition of shock areas on the spacecraft where sensi-\n\ntive equipment must not be located.\n\u2022 Equipment qualification to high shock levels.\n\u2022 Damper implementation within the HDRM or at HDRM\n\ninterface with the appendage and/or spacecraft.\nHowever, as spacecraft have become more complex\n\nwith an increased level of architecture modularity and\nversatility, a general trend has led to the reduction in the\nshock level generated by the HDRA itself. In addition, the\ntrend away from pyrotechnic systems is growing because\ncertain spacecraft do not allow pyrotechnics and sub-\nstantial cost savings can be achieved by the avoidance of\nsafety related costs. Another general trend is that tele-\ncommunication satellites have become bigger and heavier,\nwhile some science and Earth observation satellites feature\ncomposite architectures that require optical terminal\nmechanisms to operate under cryogenic environments. This\nhas led to the need for a family of low-shock HDRA across\nthe full tightening tension range [10 N\u2013150 kN],\n\nTable 9.4 HDRA technologies\n\nNon-reusable Partially reusable (need for\nrefurbishment)\n\nReusable (manually\nresettable)\n\nReusable (self-resetting)\n\n\u2022 Pyro cutters \u2022 Pyro nuts \u2022 Solenoid actuated nuts \u2022 Electro-magnetic actuators and\ntriggers\n\n\u2022 Initiators \u2022 Fusible wire actuated nuts \u2022 SMA actuated nuts \u2022 Magnetic clamps\n\n\u2022 Pyrotechnic bolt, wire cutters\nand pyro-cutters.\n\n\u2022 SMA direct actuators \u2022 Paraffin actuators\n\n\u2022 Spool based devices \u2022 Wire triggers\n\n\u2022 Separation nut \u2022 Thermal cutters\n\n\u2022 Thermal cutters\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 231\n\n\n\ntemperature range [-130 ?C/+150 ?C], and at a competi-\ntive price. It has to be noted that the full tightening and\ntemperature ranges will not be achieved with a single piece\nof hardware.\n\nThe use of shape memory alloys for HDRAs has been\nidentified as a technology trend. However, its broad\napplication for commercial applications can only be suc-\ncessful if their operating range can be increased up to\n110\u2013120 ?C.\n\n9.7.5 Position Sensors for Space Vehicle\nMechanisms\n\nIn order to check or to control the position of space\nmechanisms, position sensors are necessary. Space mecha-\nnisms generally provide rotary movements and therefore\nrequire rotary position sensors. However, linear sensors are\nsometimes used. The following applies for both cases.\n\nPosition sensors can be characterized in terms of\n\u2022 Performance, ranging from one position per turn to very\n\nhigh accuracy and resolution sensors (e.g. [24 bits per\nturn)\n\n\u2022 Technologies\n\u2022 Linear and rotary types\n\u2022 Devices with mechanical contact or contactless\n\u2022 Absolute and relative position signal.\n\nAll these position sensors are based on one of the fol-\nlowing technologies\n\u2022 Mechanical or electromechanical switches\n\u2022 Electrical variable resistance sensors\n\u2022 Magnetic/Hall effect sensors\n\u2022 Inductive sensors (magnetic resolver, RVDT, LVDT,\n\neddy current, Inductosyn, etc.)\n\u2022 Capacitive sensors\n\u2022 Optical sensors.\n\nPosition sensors are split into three categories linked to\ntheir performance level, which, in practice, result in the\nthree following domains of applications\n\u2022 A reference position sensor, providing one position per\n\nmovement or one position per turn. These are usually\nnamed \u2018switches\u2019, and are in most cases for providing a\nTM (tele-measure) about the release and/or the achieve-\nment of a displacement/deployment. Switches are some-\ntimes part of a closed loop to trigger safety mechanism\npower switch-off (heaters for actuators based on thermal\nphenomena: wax actuator, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Sensors providing limited accuracy per linear movement\nor per turn. These are usually termed low and medium\naccuracy position sensors, or \u2018potentiometer\u2019 or \u2018poten-\ntiometer equivalent\u2019. Such designations result from the\nfact that people typically address resistive angular posi-\ntion sensors as potentiometers because most of these\n\nsensors are based on variable resistance techniques pro-\nvided by means of a linear or rotating brush contact on a\nresistive path. These sensors are sensitive to the quality of\nthe tribological contact between the wiper and the track,\nwhich can change with time and operation in a vacuum\nenvironment. This might change with the emergence of\nnew and more reliable techniques. These new technolo-\ngies, either magnetic, inductive, capacitive or optical\nones, result in sensors with medium to high accuracy,\nwith a cost dependent on performance. Apart from the\nlow and medium accuracy criterion, this family of sensors\nis defined by its low cost and its low induced user\nconstraints.\n\n\u2022 High accuracy position sensors, often termed optical\nencoders because many of the applied techniques provide\nthis level of performances using optical principles. For this\ncategory of sensors, the main requirements come from the\nextreme accuracy requested for scientific payloads (i.e.\nwhen a closed loop control of the position is required) but\nalso for telecom equipment such as antenna deployment\nand pointing mechanisms. Apart from optical techniques,\nseveral other technologies can deliver these high perfor-\nmances. Further distinctions can be drawn between incre-\nmental encoders requiring a reference action upon each\nstart-up, and absolute encoders that display the position at\neach power-on. Furthermore, there are also single-turn\nabsolute encoders and multi-turn absolute encoders avail-\nable. The latter usually incorporate a mechanical gear to\nregister position across several 360? turns. Another dis-\ntinction is \u2018hard-coded\u2019 bits that represent physical\ninstances of, for example, the encoder glass disk, and\nelectronically interpolated bits that are computed from the\nhard-coded bits and usually require extensive signal con-\nditioning efforts within the control electronics loop.\nSwitches and potentiometers are low cost position sen-\n\nsors. Optical encoders are more expensive, with the cost\nbeing performance-dependent. For high accuracy sensors,\nspecial attention should be given to the variety of units that\nare used to designate an angle (bits, degree, part of degree,\narc-minute, arc-second, micro-rad, etc.). Although the\nrotary position sensor aims to provide an angular position\n(from 0 to 360?), for which the more common unit is the\nangular degree, the performance of a high-resolution\nangular position sensor is often expressed in bits or in arc-\nseconds. Each of the high position sensor performances can\nbe quantified by any of these units, although it is common to\nuse \u2018bits\u2019 when speaking about resolution and arc-seconds\nwhen speaking about accuracy and repeatability.\n\nAn optical encoder is used most of the time in the closed\ncontrol loop of a mechanism, especially for very accurate\npointing or scanning. In most cases, advanced filter and\nsignal treatment are built into the control loop in order to\nobtain extreme performance. This signal treatment is often\n\n232 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\nnumerical, which requires a level of resolution significantly\nhigher than the level of accuracy provided by the position\nsensor. Therefore, it is necessary that the optical encoder\nresolution be much higher than its stated accuracy, in order\nto get an insignificant impact of the computation error on\nthe overall performance.\n\n9.7.6 Solar Array Drive Mechanism\n\nMost three-axis stabilized satellites use solar panels to\ngenerate electrical power for their equipment. For the best\nperformance, these panels must be aligned perpendicular to\nthe Sun. In most cases, when the satellite\u2019s body is pointing\ntowards a defined target and its orientation is not fixed with\nrespect to the Sun, a relative motion between the satellite\u2019s\nbody and the solar panels must be provided. The rotating\nmechanism performing this task is the solar array drive\nmechanism (SADM). A motor is used to rotate the solar\narray at the required speed and in the required direction, and\na specific electrical device (slip-ring, cable-wrap, twisted\ncapsule, et cetera) is used to transfer the power (and data)\nbetween the solar array and the platform. The SADM is one\nof the most critical hardware components of a spacecraft\n(i.e. it is a single-point failure) and its design is usually\noptimized with respect to the specific satellite platform and\nits power needs, which can often cover a range\nfrom *500 W to *20,000 W per solar array wing.\n\nTypical main and secondary functions of a SADM\ninclude\n\u2022 To mechanically link the solar array to the satellite, whilst\n\nallowing the solar array to rotate around a specific axis.\n\u2022 To rotate the solar panel via the solar array deployment\n\nelectronics (SADE) or in response to a satellite command\n\nto maintain the solar array pointing at the Sun, to rotate\nthe solar array into a reference position, to rotate the solar\narray in a high-speed mode, to maintain the solar array in\na defined/fixed position, and to provide telemetry signals\nfrom the SADM (including the SADM angular position\nsensor).\n\n\u2022 To transfer the solar array electrical power to the satellite.\n\u2022 To transfer signals and low power lines between the\n\n\u2018rotating\u2019 part (solar array side) and the \u2018fixed\u2019 part of the\nsatellite (platform).\n\n\u2022 To assure the solar array grounding to the satellite.\nDriven by these functions, a SADM consists of three\n\nmajor subsystems\n\u2022 The rotary actuator\n\u2022 The electrical transfer unit\n\u2022 The angular position and reference sensors (Fig. 9.31).\n\n9.8 Mechanisms for Launchers\n\n9.8.1 Electro Mechanical Actuators\nfor Thrust Vector Control of Launchers\n\nThe thrust vector controller (TVC) is a subsystem that\ncontrols the direction of gimbaled nozzles of rocket engines\nin response to a request/command from the launcher tra-\njectory and attitude control system. The subsystem com-\nprises three major items\n\u2022 Battery or batteries (see Chap. 10 for an in-depth\n\ndiscussion)\n\u2022 Control unit with a dedicated controller and drive elec-\n\ntronics to command and control the mechanical actuator\nlinear displacement\n\nFig. 9.31 Solar array drive\nmechanism manufactured by\nRUAG Aerospace Zurich\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 233\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_10\n\n\n\u2022 Linear actuators (in pairs, acting on 90? planes) which\ncan be operated either with an hydraulic system (as for\nthe Ariane 5 main engine) or with an electrical motor (as\nis the case for the four stages of the Vega launcher); in\nthe latter case the actuator is called electro mechanical\nactuator (EMA).\nAll three items are connected by a cable harness for the\n\ntransmission of power and data signals. EMAs have become\nattractive candidates to replace hydraulic actuators for\nthrust vector control, thanks to an easier implementation\nand lower maintenance requirements. The EMA is a\n\nmechanism composed of an electrical motor (either co-axial\nor parallel to the piston) connected to a gearbox that drives\na roller screw. The rotational motion of the electrical motor\nis transformed into the linear motion of a piston via the\nroller screw. The linear position of the piston is measured\nvia a resolver connected to the electrical motor and a linear\nvariable differential transformer (LVDT) sensor, one part of\nwhich slides inside the roller screw and is rigidly connected\nto the piston and follows the motion. Figure 9.32 shows the\nVega Zefiro TVC subsystem being subjected to an extended\nperformance test and to vibration testing. Due to high\n\nFig. 9.32 Vega ZEFIRO electro\nmechanical actuator undergoing\nan extended performance test\naimed at the verification of the\nsubsystem operational envelope\n(top) and undergoing vibration\ntesting (bottom). Image\nS.A.B.C.A\n\n234 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\ndynamic transient loads acting on the EMA, the roller screw\nis subjected to very high rotational speeds and this repre-\nsents a physical limitation together with the electrical power\nto drive the motor since it can lead to unacceptable EMA\ndimensions and mass. The EMA\u2019s function is not only to act\nas a directional device for the launcher but also to absorb\nshock loads generated by liquid fuel rocket engines at their\nignition as a result of initial combustion instability. In either\ncase, the performance of the EMA is strongly coupled to the\nlauncher dynamics and its control system, and it ultimately\ninfluences the loads transmitted to the payload by the\nlauncher.\n\n9.8.2 Launcher Valves\n\nThere are numerous flow control valves in the main and\nupper stages of launchers with liquid-propellant rocket\nengines. The application of valves range from cryogenic,\ne.g. liquid hydrogen, chamber flow control, operating at\n20 K, up to hot gas applications like turbopump feed control\nvalve at 1,000 K. They operate under pressures as high as\n260 bars. Apart from the extreme operational temperature\nranges, there are requirements for leak tightness and precise\nregulation of the fluid. In addition to simple on/off switch-\ning applications there are proportional flow control valves\nof different sizes and speeds.\n\nThe configurations include butterfly valves, poppet\nvalves, ball valves, grid valves for fluid control as well as\nmono-stable or bi-stable on/off valves, and they can be\nactuated pneumatically, hydraulically, or electrically.\n\nThere is a trend to simplify and optimize power distri-\nbution and energy usage within launcher engines. This\ninvolves the replacement of hydraulic, pneumatic, and\nelectric components that require multiple generation sour-\nces, energy conversion methods and redundant lines with a\nsingle electrical architecture. Fluid components such as\npipes, tanks, accumulators and valves are replaced with\nelectrical harnesses that require little or no maintenance, are\nsimple to route, and are significantly more robust and\ndamage tolerant than their fluid equivalents. Power gener-\nation and the control of energy distribution are also sim-\nplified. Electrically actuated valves are equipped with\n(redundant) actuators, gearboxes, and position sensors.\n\n9.9 Tribology\n\nEvery space mechanism has moving parts. Most of the\ntime, these are in contact with fixed parts. To reduce\nfriction and wear effects as much as possible, lubricants are\nused between the parts in contact. The science that studies\nthe phenomena of friction and wear, including lubricants,\n\ntheir characteristics and interaction with the parts of the\nmechanism, is known as tribology. Three main types of\nlubricants are used for space mechanisms. Note that oils\nand greases are often grouped as liquid lubricants.\n\n9.9.1 Oils\n\nOils are very effective lubricants at sufficiently high speeds\nbecause they tend to create rather stable friction conditions\nand resistive forces/torques (i.e. low noise). However, they\ntend to evaporate and to migrate by surface creep. Therefore\noils are especially suitable for mechanisms that are sealed,\nfor example reaction wheels. It is important when designing\na mechanism to take into consideration degradation of the\noil, particularly if using perfluorinated polyether (PFPE) oils\nlike Fomblin Z25. The fluor contained in these oils tends to\nreact chemically with the iron of the steel in the contacting,\nmoving parts (for example, bearing balls and races). This\nleads to a breakdown of the oil, which is detected by an\nincrease in the contact loads or torques. This increase of\ncontact loads is due to a polymerization of the oil (creation\nof solid particles). Some oils like mapping and comparing\n(MAC) oils (for example Nye2001a) do not contain PFPE\nand are therefore less sensitive to lubricant breakdown.\n\n9.9.2 Greases\n\nGreases are widely used in space mechanisms because they\ntend to generate relatively low noise and provide good\nlubrication even at low speed. They are also less sensitive to\nevaporation and surface creep than oils. In fact grease for\nspace applications is oil (known as the base oil of the\ngrease) in which solid substances are added to assist the\nlubrication process, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene\n(PTFE) particles. The same problem with the degradation of\nthe lubricant exists for the greases, as grease contains its\nbase oil.\n\n9.9.3 Solid Lubricants\n\nSolid lubricants tend to generate more noise in the resistive\nforces and torques but do not evaporate. They are therefore\nsuitable for extreme temperatures (cryogenics, or very hot\napplications) or in applications where contamination by\ncondensation could be an issue (for example, in optical\nsystems). Solid lubricants will be used, for example, on\nBepiColombo where temperatures of about 250 ?C are\nexpected. The most used solid lubricants for space mecha-\nnisms are sputtered molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and ion\nplated lead. Sputtered MoS2 exhibits a lower friction than\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 235\n\n\n\nthe ion plated lead (and it is typically less noisy) but has a\nlower life expectancy. Neither lubricant is suitable for use\nin air, as the friction coefficient significantly increases and\nthe life expectancy is considerably reduced.\n\nTo use solid lubricants during ground testing in air\n(which has the advantage of leading to reduced cost), the\nsolid lubricant can be located in a reservoir which, in case\nof a bearing, is the cage. In this case, the lubricant is\ntransferred from the cage to the balls and from the balls to\nthe races. Thanks to the reservoir, even if the solid lubricant\nis degraded in air, new fresh lubricant is provided by the\nreservoir. For sputtered MoS2, the reservoir (or the cage in\ncase of a bearing) can be made of special compound\nmaterials, e.g. PGM-HT (a composite of PTFE, glass fiber,\nand MoS2). For ion plated lead, the reservoir (cage in case\nof a bearing) can be made of leaded bronze. To help with\nlubrication before the lubricant transfer is installed, sput-\ntered MoS2 will be also placed on the contacting surfaces\n(balls and races in case of a ball bearing using a PGM-HT\ncage). When using a leaded bronze cage, ion plated lead\nwill also be placed on races for the same reason. It is\nimportant to perform the run-in of the mechanism (or the\nbearing) in vacuum because of the degradation of the\nsputtered MoS2 and ion plated lead in air. A typical run-in\nfor a bearing consists of about 50,000 revolutions. It is to be\nnoted that while PGM-HT can withstand several million\nrevolutions in air after run-in, leaded bronze is limited to\nnot more than 100,000 revolutions. Both PGM-HT and\nleaded bronze can provide life expectancies of several\nhundreds of million revolutions in vacuum in the case of a\nbearing.\n\n9.10 Design and Verification of Space\nVehicle Mechanisms\n\n9.10.1 Numerical Simulations: Multi-body\nDynamic Simulation\n\nIn recent years, space-system design has shown a clear trend\ntowards increasingly complex configurations. Typical\nexamples are the use of several flexible components (anten-\nnas and solar arrays), the need for deployment and retrieval\nmechanisms, the demand for high precision pointing sys-\ntems, and an increase in mission scenarios that involve the\nassembly of large structures in space. This trend has also\ncaused an evolution towards a multi-disciplinary design\napproach, particularly in the area of dynamics and control.\n\nIn order to study the performance of generic controlled\ndynamic systems, it is essential to have a dedicated tool that\nallows the user to model, in a short time, the complex\nbehavior of the system\u2019s dynamics, and their interactions\nwith the control. In fact, some systems require a model with\n\nmore than one body in order to take into account their\ndifferent characteristics and their mutual dynamic interac-\ntions. This is a non-simple task, requiring time to under-\nstand, code, and validate the dynamic behavior of the\nsystem. A large amount of research has gone into the\ndevelopment and improvement of multi-body software,\nwith the aim of reducing the time to model a system and the\ncomputation time required to run an analysis. Multi-body\nsoftware involves the derivation of the equations of motion\nfor multi-body systems, which are systems characterized by\nseveral bodies connected by hinges that permit relative\nmotion across them. Based on the latest improvements in\nsoftware and technical experience, the modeling and sim-\nulation approach enhances the design and verification pro-\ncess of aerospace mechanisms/systems. This refers to\nseveral aspects such as\n\u2022 Anticipate and understand hardware performance\n\u2022 Identify criticalities of key design parameters by means\n\nof parametric/sensitivity analyses\n\u2022 Optimize the hardware design\n\u2022 Interpret the hardware performance by a model-assisted\n\napproach\n\u2022 Diagnose any potential anomalies.\n\nTypical multi-body dynamics activities are performed in\nsupport of numerous projects\n\u2022 Mechanisms\n\n\u2013 Design and analyze mechanisms systems\n\u2013 Assess parametric design solutions and to optimize the\n\nperformance of structures and mechanisms\n\u2013 Predict the static, kinematic, and dynamic behavior of\n\nmechanical systems\n\u2013 Animate the motion of dynamic, solid models\n\u2013 Simulate control loops incorporating mechanical parts,\n\ne.g. active structures of mechanisms\n\u2013 Perform conceptual design studies and correlate test\n\nand analysis data\n\u2013 Investigate the performance and possible malfunction\n\nof mechanical systems, including in orbit\n\u2013 Modeling complex devices and mechanisms control\n\ndesign\n\u2013 Coupled system frequencies and time responses.\n\n\u2022 Spacecraft\n\u2013 Modeling unconventional spacecraft dynamics,\n\nincluding orbital environment disturbances,\n\u2013 Control laws, including sensors and actuation\n\ndynamics,\n\u2013 Coupled system frequencies and time responses,\n\u2013 Docking phase analyses.\n\n\u2022 Launch Vehicles\n\u2013 Non-linear time dynamic simulations for flexible bod-\n\nies with time varying characteristics\n\u2013 Atmospheric environment including external disturbance\n\u2013 Launch vehicle flight dynamics-control interaction\n\n236 G.

This trend is also\nconfirmed in the field of electromagnetic simulation (and\nmulti-physics simulation in general), where several soft-\nware houses are developing tools for the design and analysis\nof 3D/2D problems, such as motors, actuators, transformers,\nand other electrical and electromechanical devices that are\ncommon to automotive, military/aerospace and industrial\nsystems. In particular, for space applications a big benefit\ncan be gained by using these tools to design and optimize\ndevices such as\n\u2022 Electric motors (stepper, brushless DC, etc.)\n\u2022 Custom-design rotary and linear actuators\n\u2022 Active and passive magnetic bearings\n\u2022 Electromagnetic and capacitive sensors\n\u2022 Contactless power and signal transfer devices\n\u2022 Electromagnetic brakes\n\u2022 Hold-down and release devices (based on electromag-\n\nnetic operating principles)\n\u2022 Special systems.\n\nThe software packages most commonly used to perform\nthese analyses are various. The French company CEDRAT\nhas developed the commercial software package FLUX?,\nwhich is widely used by European industries. In global\nterms, Maxwell?, ANSYS? Multiphysics Solutions and\nCOMSOL Multiphysics? are widely used, primarily thanks\nto their ability to interface with a multi-physics environment\nfor coupled thermal, mechanical, and electromagnetic\nanalyses. Furthermore, open source software is available for\ncertain problems, for instance Finite Element Method\nMagnetics (FEMM) for 2D magnetostatic simulation. In\ngeneral, the capabilities of these tools allow the study of\n\u2022 2D and 3D problems\n\u2022 Static and transient analyses\n\u2022 Coupling with mechanical (rotating and translating)\n\nmotion\n\u2022 Coupling with external electrical circuits\n\u2022 Solution of electric field problems\n\u2022 Coupling with external mechanical loads\n\u2022 Interface with MATLAB?/Simulink?.\n\n9.10.3 Verification Tests of Mechanisms\n\nThe required reliability of a space mechanism is much\nhigher than is usually necessary for general ground mech-\nanisms, primarily because it is usually impractical to\nimplement repairs during its operation. The capability of the\nmechanism to fulfill its requirements as well as to maintain\nthe desired performance throughout the entire mission,\nwithout repair, must therefore be assured. In order to\nachieve this, a rigorous requirement verification process\nmust be adopted. The verification process involves dem-\nonstrating requirement compliance by means of one or more\nof the following methods: review of design, analysis,\ninspection and test.\n\nVerification by test is implemented on a set of selected\nmodels chosen for the project. This \u2018model philosophy\u2019 is\ndefined by means of an iterative process that combines pro-\ngrammatic constraints, verification strategies, and the\nintegration and test program, taking into account the devel-\nopment status of the candidate design solution. The first\nmethod consists of performing a verification of the design\ndocuments, reports, and technical description in order to\nprove that a requirement is met unambiguously. The second\nmethod employs accepted analytical techniques to provide\nevidence of a requirement\u2019s fulfillment. Verification by\ninspection is achieved by visual determination of a charac-\nteristic (e.g. construction features, presence of an element).\nThe test verification of a requirement consist of experimen-\ntally measuring one or more parameters or functions within a\nrepresentative environment.\n\n9.11 Space Vehicle Mechanisms Materials\nand Processes\n\nRules for selecting materials to build spacecraft mecha-\nnisms follow general materials selection rules. Regarding\ntheir functionality, the selection of materials is a trade-off\nprocess that takes into account the following\n\u2022 Mechanical properties (e.g. strength, stiffness, fracture\n\ntoughness, fatigue resistance, micro-yielding, creep)\n\u2022 Physical properties (e.g. coefficient of thermal expansion,\n\ncoefficient of moisture expansion, thermal conductivity,\nelectrical conductivity, thermo-optical properties)\n\n\u2022 Chemical properties (e.g. corrosion, susceptibility to\nhydrogen embrittlement)\n\n\u2022 Interfacial characteristics (e.g. mechanical contact sur-\nface effects such as self-lubricating capabilities, suscep-\ntibility to cold welding or galling)\n\n\u2022 Combinations of the above (e.g. stress corrosion, corro-\nsion fatigue).\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 237\n\n\n\nRegarding the mission constraints, the material selection\nmust take into consideration the specific environments on\nthe ground, during launch, and in space. This includes\n\u2022 Temperature and thermo-cycling\n\u2022 Vacuum (outgassing)\n\u2022 Radiation\n\u2022 Electrical charge and discharge\n\u2022 Fluid compatibility\n\u2022 Galvanic compatibility\n\u2022 Atomic oxygen\n\u2022 Moisture (absorption and desorption)\n\u2022 Crewed environment (for hazard and risk potential, both\n\nstructural and physiological) additional requirements\nsuch as outgassing, toxicity and odor, bacteria and fungus\ngrowth, flammability, etc.\nRegarding the space mechanisms materials interfaces,\n\nmany requirements are related to the surface characteristics\nand the most adequate surface treatment must be applied in\n\u2018ad equation\u2019 with each specific application\u2019s needs. The\nsurface treatment aims in general to\n\u2022 Protect the surfaces against corrosion, cold-welding,\n\nfretting, lubricant creep\n\u2022 Improve electrical or thermal conductivity and thermal-\n\noptical properties\n\u2022 Lubricate the surface and improving its wear resistance\n\u2022 Improve the tribological-surface quality by polishing,\n\ncleaning, or hardening.\nBased on these factors, the main materials used in\n\nmechanisms are aluminum alloys (2024 T8, 6061 T6, 7075\nT73, etc.), stainless steel (300 series, 400 series including\n440C for ball bearings, 15-5 PH with H1000 and above, 17-\n7 PH CH900, etc.), nickel alloys (Inconel 718, etc.) and\ntitanium alloys (Ti6AlV, etc.).\n\n9.12 Deployable Structures for Space\nApplications\n\nEnvelope limitation within launcher fairings has always\nbeen a major design driver for spacecraft configuration;\nsometimes, if not often, more severe than the mass limita-\ntions. Various techniques to reduce the spacecraft volume at\nlaunch have been developed, giving rise to the entirely (and\nalmost space specific) topic of \u2018deployable structures Space\ntechnology\u2019. A significant number and type of deployable\nstructures have been successfully operated in space, ranging\nfrom very small booms to large antenna reflectors. Basic\nbuilding blocks of a deployable structure include\n\u2022 Joints, to provide relative motion\n\u2022 Actuators, to provide deployment energy\n\n\u2022 Hold-downs release mechanisms, to keep the structure in\nits stowed state during launch\n\n\u2022 Dampers, to reduce end of travel shock, when energy\nstorage based mechanisms are used\n\n\u2022 Latches, to ensure that the structure locks in its final\ndeployed configuration\n\n\u2022 Interconnecting rigid structural members (struts, panels),\nto provide structural support to the payload to be\ndeployed.\nAlthough deployable structures such as magnetometer\n\ndeployable booms, thermal shields, and articulated masts\nare common, it is often possible to observe a less distinct\nseparation between the different elements, particularly with\nstructural members that also provide deployment energy\n(e.g. by deformation in tape spring mechanisms) or trajec-\ntory guidance. Indeed, an entire class of \u2018self-deploying\u2019\nstructures can be formed by applying pre-load or defor-\nmation to specific structural members.\n\nGenerally, the main concern for the deployable struc-\nture designer is that the deployment function is success-\nfully achieved, with the required end-of-deployment\nperformance. Due to the extreme difficulty of perfectly\nreproducing on the ground the same environmental con-\nditions to be experienced in orbit (and specifically the\nimpossibility of perfectly reproducing the absence of\ngravity, especially for large structures), the final verifi-\ncation of deployment functionality will always be asso-\nciated with a feeling of imponderability and generate\nmajor relief when successfully achieved in operational\nconditions. To minimize the intrinsic risk of any kind of\ndeployment malfunction, the designer is forced to employ\nconcepts that are as reliable as possible, which in turns\nmeans as simple as possible, to achieve an optimal syn-\nthesis between the various requirements and constraints.\nThis effort is normally rewarded by the elaboration of\ndesign concepts that can be said to be \u2018elegant\u2019. While\nthis term is difficult to technically define, it is generally\nwell recognized by peers and customers, and sometime\ncan be an important aspect of a commercial success. It\nhas also to be noted that deployable structures have to be\nconsidered, and approached, as a system level issue.\nIndeed, even in the simple case of short deployable\nbooms, their number, location/orientation, both in the\nstowed and deployed configurations, have an impact at\nsystem level (occultation, risk of collisions, mechanical\ninterference, and thermal fluxes implications). And\nfor large deployable structures, the overall spacecraft\nconfiguration and attitude control subsystem might be\ndriven by the deployable structure\u2019s architecture and\nperformance.\n\n238 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\n9.13 Design drivers for Deployable\nStructures\n\n9.13.1 Deployment Reliability\n\nThe main design driver for a deployable structure is, in\nalmost all applications, its release and deployment reli-\nability. Despite such fundamental relevance, few require-\nments are more difficult to quantify than those relating to\nreliability. Techniques and approaches derived from elec-\ntronic components are employed, based on standard reli-\nability figures for elementary parts/couplings. A statistical\ndatabase for the reliability figures applicable to the real\nstructure and components under design are typically of\nlimited availability, and above all, the overall reliability of a\ndeployable structure can rarely be defined by the summation\nof individual reliability parts.\n\nReliability concepts have to be incorporated into the\ndesign in its very first stages, by means of a balanced and\nharmonized design approach. To exploit hardware or\ncompany heritage in components and concepts is natural,\nbut innovation must not be disregarded. Redundancy must\nbe implemented, but not be intended as simple duplication\nof parts or a means of dealing with complexity. Simplicity\nof design solutions is a must, but should not be confused\nwith simplistic approaches. Robustness must be pursued,\nbut without overdesigning. Overall, a deployable structure\noperates as a unique organism, where individual compo-\nnents harmonically cooperate for a successful performance\nof the entire system.\n\n9.13.2 Stiffness\n\nStiffness requirements are normally applicable and critical\nfor deployable structures. Typical stiffness requirements for\ndeployable antenna reflectors are in the range of 2.5 Hz and\nabove. Larger structures, like solar arrays or large reflectors,\ncan have first eigenfrequencies below 1.0 Hz (even down to\nfew tenths of a Hertz in some cases). Although it might\nseem that the stiffness requirement affects mainly the static/\nstructural parts of the mechanisms (e.g. the hinge shaft\nsection or the mounting flange sizing), it has to be stressed\nthat it might strongly influence the essential \u2018mechanism\u2019\naspect of the design. Indeed a higher or lower stiffness\nrequirement might imply the need (or not) for a latching\nsystem, which may alter substantially the overall mecha-\nnisms design or its components selection. Similarly, a\nhigher or lower first eigenfrequency might imply higher or\nlower end-of-travel shocks, and the need (or not) for a\n\ndamping device (see the following Sect. 9.13.4 on actuation\nmargins). It has also to be noted that the stiffness require-\nment associated with the deployable structure is often\nattributed on the basis of \u2018rigid spacecraft mounting inter-\nfaces\u2019. The degree of validity of this assumption is often\nquestionable, and sometimes it affects the first frequency of\nthe deployed structure by a factor of ten. It is therefore\nessential to establish a dialogue with system engineers to\navoid over-designing critical parts of the mechanisms,\nwhich besides other important negative effects might result\nin a less reliable deployable structure.\n\n9.13.3 Accuracy/Stability\n\nAccuracy of the final deployed configuration is sometime an\nessential requirement (e.g. high-frequency antenna reflec-\ntors, optical telescopes, and so forth). Accuracy can be in\nthe range of several thousandths of a degree (or less). High\naccuracy normally requires the implementation of a latching\ndevice, possibly of a type that generates some degree of pre-\nload into the system, once actuated. By pre-loading the\njoints, residual backlash is recovered and the final deployed\nstructure will have better repeatability and superior accu-\nracy performance.\n\n9.13.4 Actuation Margins\n\nAs any mechanism-operated system, deployable structures\nhave to show adequate margins versus actuation forces/\ntorques against opposing resistance forces/torques. One\ncomplication is the presence of a harness routed across its\njoints and it is important to define/characterize the parasitic\neffect at an early stage of the design. In addition, thermal\neffects (low temperatures in particular) can fundamentally\ninfluence the level of parasitic effects. An easy solution\nwould be to incorporate enough margins in the design to\naccount for poor assumptions. Unfortunately, excessive\nactuation margins may result in severe risk of structural\ndamage at end of deployment (or during deployment). For\nexample, for energy storage based actuation such as spring\nactuated deployment, the end-of-travel shock may be a\ndesign driving case. This is particularly true when thermal\neffects reduce friction-resistance components. A speed\nregulator or damping device might then be deemed neces-\nsary, substantially affecting the overall reliability of the\nmechanism. Again, a balanced design (in this case avoiding\nexcessive actuation torque) is essential in order to maximize\noverall reliability.\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 239\n\n\n\n9.14 Verification of Deployable Structures\n\nThe on-ground test verification of deployable structures is\nstrongly affected by the presence of the gravity field.\nGravity off-loading jigs are normally necessary, with few\nexclusions. Testing under one \u2018g\u2019 conditions is further\ncomplicated by the fact that off-loading jigs should be\ncompatible with thermal vacuum chambers in order to\nperform functional testing under representative environ-\nmental conditions. Obviously, making an off-loading sys-\ntem compatible with extreme temperatures and vacuum is a\nchallenging and very expensive task. Furthermore, thermal\nvacuum chamber volumes are typically quite limited, and\noff-loading devices generally large (both in height and in-\nplane). Hence, verification in thermal vacuum chambers of\nfull deployment functionality, particularly for large struc-\ntures, is seldom performed. Alternative qualification logics\nare based on qualification at different levels (equipment,\nsubassembly, etc.) and limiting the thermal vacuum test to a\npartial deployment (release from hold-down points with\nlimited angular motion). For a large structure, like an\nantenna reflector, in-orbit validation would be required in\norder to commercialize the product.\n\nIn order to support the design phases, and to complement\nthe on-ground verification phases of deployable structures,\nsimulation activities have come into play. Indeed, for large\nsolar arrays, with multiple hinge axes oriented in different\northogonal directions, even room temperature off-loading\nsystems are almost impossible to conceive.\n\n9.14.1 Simulations\n\nSpace-system design has shown a clear trend towards\nincreased configuration complexity in response to chal-\nlenging mission requirements. The need for large apertures\nhas been one major driver in this respect, including large\nsolar arrays for increased power generation, large antenna\nreflectors, large sunshields for scientific applications (e.g.\nJWST) and solar sails. Common to those applications are\nthe use of several flexible components, the need for\ndeployment and retrieval mechanisms, and above all the\nneed to verify on the ground the deployment functionality\nand the overall system performance. Representative\ndeployment and performance testing on ground of such\nlarge structures are often very difficult if not impossible\n(mainly due to gravity, but also including air and other\ndisturbing effects). Consequently, the need for increasingly\nsophisticated simulation tools and techniques has emerged.\nThis trend has also caused an evolution towards a multi-\ndisciplinary design/verification approach, with its major\nemphasis in the area of dynamics and control (particularly\n\nas increased accuracy and stability performances are\nincreasingly sought for pointing payloads and antennas).\n\nAmong the broad number of deployment applications,\nthere are three main classes of problem, as discussed below.\n\n9.14.1.1 \u2018Conventional\u2019 Deployment Systems\nThese systems are characterized by mainly rigid motion\namong the different mechanical elements, taking into\naccount small deformations due to the structural dynamics.\nFurthermore, non-linear hinge characteristics (friction,\nbacklash, hysteresis, etc.) are also taken into account during\nthe analysis. The main requirement is to properly model\nlightweight structures with variable boundary conditions\ndue to the presence of motors at the hinges, locking sys-\ntems, friction, and so forth. Advanced multi-body software\ntechniques permit the investigation of coupled rigid and\nstructural dynamics with a control system, aiming at\npointing accuracy/stability performance verification.\n\n9.14.1.2 Deployment Systems with Large\nDeformation\n\nFor applications like large deployable antennas or some\nsolar sails, it is not realistic to neglect effects due to large\ndeformations of the mechanical parts. For this class of\nproblem, either multi-body software capable of simulating\nthe non-linear behavior of some specific structural elements,\nor finite element codes that take into account the rigid body\ndynamics, are currently used.\n\n9.14.1.3 Deployment of Inflatable Structures\nThe last class includes the deployment of inflatable struc-\ntures, where it is important to simulate the inflation\ndynamics, the wrinkling of thin membrane, the definition of\nthe initial shape, the fluid structure interaction, etc. The\nsimulation of inflatable structures is a very demanding task.\nThis is essentially due to the highly non-linear nature of the\ninvolved phenomena, including large variation in shape and\nin mass density. Moreover, complicated physical phenom-\nena, such as wrinkling of a very thin membrane might\noccur. The solution of the governing equations of the\nproblem is achieved at a very high computational cost.\n\n9.15 Categories of Deployable Structures\n\n9.15.1 Single Deployment Appendages\n\nOne-shot deployable appendages typically include booms\ncarrying magnetometers or other small payloads, antenna\nreflectors (up to about 3 m diameter), solar radiators, ther-\nmal shields, and a variety of small panels.\n\n240 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\nThe typical alternative approach is whether to use a\nmotorized deployment or one based on energy storage such as\na preloaded spring. Depending on a case-by-case basis, the\noptimal solution is selected, with the motorized option being\npreferred. The case where repeated deployment/stowage are\nrequired is excluded here, as only an electrical motor based\nsolution is realistically possible. Indeed, when a substantial\namount of harness is present, and in particular when\ndeployment occurs at a low temperature (below -20 ?C), a\nlarge reserve of actuation torque has to be foreseen. This is\nnormally not feasible with spring driven hinges, where a\ntorque excess would result in high end-of-deployment shock.\nThat is one main factor for the selection of an electrically\nactuated deployment mechanisms.\n\nAs previously noted, the end-of-travel shock is a driving\nrequirement. To reduce its level, speed regulators or\ndampers are used. Those devices are based on a number of\ndifferent working principles such as dry friction, viscous\nfluid effects, parasitic eddy currents, or more exotic con-\ncepts like low temperature melting alloys or clockwork\nescape mechanisms.\n\nConcerning the deployed accuracy, adjustable end stops\nare typically implemented, with the contact surface shapes\nrounded to minimize Hertzian contact stress and to maxi-\nmize accuracy and repeatability. Constant-torque types of\nspring are also implemented to realize a smooth deployment,\nwith minimal variation of the actuation torque. Maximum\ncare has to be taken in the design of the harness routing\nacross the hinge unit. This is fundamental in order to mini-\nmize (and above all ensure repeatable) harness induced\nparasitic effects. Also the design of the hinge\u2019s thermal\nprotection hardware, normally in the form of multi-layer\ninsulation blanket (MLI), is very important, since a non-\noptimal MLI lay-out or fixation system may result either in\nhot-spots (where Sun-trapping occurs) or in the mechanism\njamming at deployment. The minimum distances between\nfixed and mobile MLI layers is specified in the European\nMechanisms Standard is 15 mm.\n\n9.15.2 Uni-dimensional Deployable Structures\n\nSo-called uni-dimensional deployable structures repre-\nsented by the booms and masts of many mission applica-\ntions. Major technology types include\n\u2022 Rolled, open-section tubes based on metallic thin foils,\n\nlike the Storable Tubular Extendable Member (STEM)\nand \u2018Bi-STEM\u2019 types used to deploy the Hubble Space\nTelescope solar arrays\n\n\u2022 Rolled, closed-section tubes, like the collapsible tube\nmast (CTM) developed by SENER in 1986, and more\nrecently the collapsible CFRP boom developed by DLR\n\n\u2022 Coilable masts, like the CoilABLE Mast from the ABLE\ncompany in the US\n\n\u2022 Articulated foldable masts, like the ADAM and FAST\nmast, also from the ABLE company, being used for ISS\nsolar panel deployment and for the NASA/NGA Shuttle\nRadar Topography Mission (SRTM) mission\n\n\u2022 Telescopic masts, in different size and technologies, but\nalways limited to a few meters length, and with less\nimpressive stowed-to-deployed length and linear mass\nvalues.\nThe main differences between these technologies are\n\nmainly in the stiffness, which, not surprisingly, is inversely\nproportional to the mass per unit length. In particular the\nfirst two categories (open and closed section rolled tubes)\nare giving the lowest specific mass (mass per unit length)\nand package efficiency (ratio between stowed and deployed\nlength), whilst the coilable and articulated masts provide the\nbest stiffness performances.\n\nTelescopic booms form a particular category. They\ncannot compete with the specific mass of other categories,\nnor with their superior maximum extension capabilities (up\nto 60 m for the ADAM mast, in-orbit), but still can compete\nfor shorter lengths with a high stiffness requirement. It has\nto be noted that the longer and stiffer the application, the\nmore complex the boom structure becomes, going from a\nsimple thin foil of metal or CFRP for collapsible booms, to\nthe very complex truss type of structure for the ADAM and\nFAST mast.\n\nConcerning the final as-deployed accuracy of booms,\nmilli-metric requirements are applicable for length of 12 m\nand more. Consequently, a backlash-free design is needed.\nThis is easy for the monolithic rollable-collapsible tube\nconcepts, but requires high design skill for a truss where\nsequential locking of individual bays must be ensured for\noverall truss mechanical performance. Low coefficient of\nthermal expansion materials (CFRP) are used whenever\npossible in order to ensure an overall high thermo-elastic\ndimensional stability of the deployed structure. Cross sec-\ntion size becomes particularly important for very long\napplications, where the overall buckling load (due to\nmechanical load, but enhanced by thermal effects) might be\nthe driving requirement.\n\n9.15.3 Bi-dimensional Deployable Structures\n\nBi-dimensional deployable structures typically include\n\u2022 Large antenna reflectors\n\u2022 Large thermal shields\n\u2022 Solar arrays\n\u2022 Solar sails\n\u2022 Lenses for solar concentration.\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 241\n\n\n\nLarge solar arrays are a mature technology, but the state-\nof-the-art is still progressing due to increasing array surface\nrequirements. Associated mechanisms include classical\ncomponents (spring or electric motor based), advanced\ncomponents (for example, tape-spring based inter-panel\nhinges), and inter-panel synchronization systems. For this\nclass of deployable structures (as well as for large thermal\nshields) verification of the final performance (particularly in\nthe relevant environment) is a critical issue, and advanced\nsimulation techniques (as discussed earlier) are becoming\nincreasingly important for the final product qualification.\n\nSolar sails and large solar concentrators are still (with\nvery rare exceptions) at the laboratory prototype level. Due\nto the very large dimensions (sometimes spanning 50 m and\nmore), suitable step-by-step development approaches and\nintermediate-size validation models for flight verification\npurposes are proposed. Simulation capabilities are also\nessential for design consolidation and validation.\n\n9.15.4 Special Cases of Deployable Structures\n\n9.15.4.1 Large Deployable Antenna Reflectors\nRequirements\n\nAntenna reflectors belong to the category of external\nspacecraft appendices that are most severely exposed to the\nthermal, radiation, and mechanical environments, both\nduring launch and in orbit. In addition, the requirements for\nradio frequency performance, dimensional accuracy and\nstability, mass, and stiffness drive the design and verifica-\ntion. The only solution to these demands is to use the most\nadvanced materials, manufacturing technologies, and engi-\nneering methods. The case of large antenna reflectors is a\nspecial one due to the dimensions (typically above 4 m\nprojected aperture) since the antenna is \u2018built\u2019 in space\nfollowing a rather complex sequence of release, deploy-\nment, tensioning, and locking steps. Each of these opera-\ntions can represent a single-point failure for the mission.\nThis section provides a general classification of large\ndeployable reflectors based on the technical solutions\navailable, a brief summary of existing products and their\nperformances, critical technologies, and verification meth-\nods. Considering telecommunications, Earth observation,\nand scientific applications, the functional requirements can\nbe divided into two main groups. In the first group, the\nfunctional requirements result in a projected aperture of\n4\u20137 m with a root-mean-square (RMS) surface accuracy of\naround k/50 (i.e. 2.5 mm in S band) for applications mostly\nin L and S bands or k/50 to k/100 for applications from C to\nKa band (i.e. 0.1 mm in Ka band). The second group cor-\nresponds to projected apertures in the range of 9\u201325 m with\nan RMS surface accuracy of around k/50 for applications\nmostly in UHF and L/S bands. The pointing stability of the\n\nreflector with an arm attached should be in the range of\n0.020\u20130.1 ?half-cone. Concerning mass, the technology\nstate-of-the art is around 1 kg/m2 for the very large aper-\ntures, but for higher accuracies 2 kg/m2 is often necessary.\n\n9.15.4.2 Deployable Reflector Types,\nTechnical Solutions and Existing\nProducts\n\nLarge deployable reflectors can be classified according to\nthe reflecting surface technology and the supporting struc-\nture architecture as summarized in Table 9.5, along with\ntheir realization as flight products or advanced development\nmodels. This classification and product list is not exhaus-\ntive, it merely gives a sense of the technology.\n\nThe most numerous class is the metal-mesh reflecting\nsurface, for both historical reasons and technical maturity,\nespecially for the largest dimensions. Metal meshes require\ntensioning in order to acquire the parabolic shape and to\ngenerate a stable electrical contact between the metal wires.\nTheir shape accuracy is a function of the facet dimensions\nor number of attachment points, as well as the tension\napplied. The materials of the mesh (typically molybdenum\ntungsten wires) and the backing structure (CFRP and\naramidic fibers) control the thermal stability. Among the\narchitectures available, the peripheral ring structure and its\nvariants offer the best performances within the diameter\nrange of about 6\u201315 m. Meanwhile, a modular construction\ncan cover the full range of dimensions (Fig. 9.33).\n\nMembrane technologies have been employed in inflat-\nable structures, as well as in mechanically tensioned sur-\nfaces. The well-known thin metalized polyimide films or\naramidic fiber fabrics require tension in order to stiffen and\nstabilize the shape. Despite remarkable progress, in-orbit\npolymerization and rigidization of inflatable structures has\nnot yet been commercially adopted for the demanding RF\nrequirements mentioned.\n\nAs regards the mechanical tensioning of membranes,\nsurface accuracy has been achieved on flat surfaces for low\nRF frequency operation (typically P to L bands), e.g. for\nmulti-layer SAR sub-arrays. In the case of doubly curved\nsurfaces, the technology applied for mechanical tensioning\nof the membranes often results in demanding compromises\nof surface accuracy, deployment reliability, and mass.\n\nDeformable shell reflectors (also known as \u2018spring-\nback\u2019) offer a lightweight alternative solution when folding\nin only one direction is sufficient. Deployment motorization\nis provided by the elastic energy stored in the deformed\nshell. Due to the use of CFRP, often made of triaxial fabrics\nand epoxy resins, the strength and creep of the fibers and\nresin limit the deformed curvature. The maximum dimen-\nsion achievable by this class is typically a projected aperture\nof 6\u20137 m due to the folding. An alternative is to use silicone\nas the matrix, to achieve more efficient packaging. The\n\n242 G. Miglioreno and T. K.

The solid\nreflecting surface portions are typically built in CFRP, thus\nallowing for high-frequency operation, often in the Ka\nband. The solid portion can also be taken as a central\nreflector of a hybrid construction, complemented by edge\nmounting of an inflatable annulus or deployable radial ribs\nthat support a metal mesh.\n\n9.15.4.3 Technologies\nThe technologies that enable large deployable reflectors (in\naddition to the actuators) are mainly those related to the\nmanufacturing and integration of the reflecting surface,\nmitigation of shape imperfections, and improved stability of\nthe supporting structures\n\u2022 Metal knitted mesh materials and processes, production,\n\nintegration, and tensioning\n\u2022 Alternative reflecting surface technologies, such as the\n\nCFRS shell-membrane, which does not require tensioning\n\u2022 Multi-feed illumination systems to perform digital beam\n\nreconfiguration in order to correct performance losses\ncaused by disturbances (attitude, orbital and thermal)\n\n\u2022 High-performance structural materials providing higher\nstiffness/mass and thermal conductivity by the use of\npitch carbon fibers and carbon nano species.\nTechnologies maturing in other applications may be\n\nemployed in large reflectors\n\u2022 Inflatable components for very large apertures (above\n\n20 m), considering the mass efficiency of inflatable\nelements\n\n\u2022 Shape memory alloys\n\u2022 Technologies for mechanical shaping in orbit.\n\nAnother aspect is the conceptual design and selection of\nthe most appropriate architecture. This is not a technolog-\nical point per se, but is very closely related to the selection\nof the reflecting surface and shape control. The truss-tension\nconcept mounted on a peripheral ring or radial booms,\nseems to show a rather robust behavior that performs well\ncompared to other architectures. The different methods for\nfolding rings or booms have a strong impact on the mass,\nstiffness, shape stability, and deployment reliability. In\nFig. 9.34, some of the commonly used folding schemes of\narticulated struts are summarized, including the pantograph\nand its variants. These folding schemes can be employed\neither in the radial booms or in the peripheral rings.\nExamples of their use can be identified in the existing\nreflectors listed in Table 9.5.\n\nInflatable structures are deployable structures whose\ndeployment concept is based on inflation by gas. Inflatable\nspace structures have been under development and evalua-\ntion for 50 years. Indeed their potential for low-cost flight\nhardware, high mechanical packaging efficiency, and low\nmass makes them very attractive. This was especially\nimportant in the context of launch vehicle capabilities in the\nearly 1960s (limited volume and mass). In Europe, ESA\nshowed an interest in large inflatable structures as early as\nthe 1970s. An initial study performed by Contraves con-\ncluded \u2018\u2018the balloon technology introduces a novel approach\nto the manufacture of curved surface, an approach which is\nnot restricted to the realization of antennae\u2019\u2019. Further work\nwas then conducted and the feasibility of inflatable, space-\nrigidized structures (ISRS) was positively assessed and a\nreference object (a 10 m antenna reflector) was designed and\nsubjected to a preliminary analysis. Materials investigations\nwere performed to define cure catalysts, cure cycle,\nmechanical properties, and electrical properties. Finally, a\n?-scaled model (LOAD-3 for Large Offset Antenna Dem-\nonstrator 3 m diameter) was manufactured, deployed, and\nmechanical and electrical tests performed. Based on the very\npromising results, a full-scale model of a 10 m aperture\nantenna reflector was built. The final test to be performed,\nthe flight experiment, was never conducted, but an in-orbit\ncure experiment was done. In addition to the development\nactivities performed for the LOAD models, several projects\nhave expressed interest in inflatable structures.\n\nIt is also of note that the in-orbit modules deployed by\nBigelow Aerospace, intended to be fully crew-rated, use\ninflatable technology licensed, originally, from NASA in\n\nFig. 9.34 Folding schemes of deployable linear elements\n\n244 G. Miglioreno and T. K. Henriksen\n\n\n\nthe late 1990s but further developed with proprietary\nextensions by Bigelow Aerospace.\n\n9.15.4.4 Design and Verification\nThe verification of inflatable structures is a challenge.\nIndeed, inflatable structures have properties that make their\ntesting particularly difficult. These are pressurized systems,\nsometimes of very large dimensions, low mass, and with a\nchange of state in case of rigidization. The effect of Earth\ngravity must be properly accounted for. Indeed, deployment\nis strongly influenced by gravity, and in some cases these\nstructures are not able to sustain their own weight (espe-\ncially before rigidization). They therefore require gravity\ncompensation systems. Atmospheric pressure also affects\nthe test results, as it might be of several orders of magnitude\nlarger than the internal pressure required to inflate a thin\nmembrane in vacuum (a few Pa). Tests under vacuum may\nbe impracticable for large structures.\n\nThe test set-up itself is also a challenge for inflatable\nstructures. Indeed, the instrumentation (strain gauges,\naccelerometers, etc.) cannot be used because its presence\nwould influence the mass distribution (the accelerometer\nmass might be of the same order of magnitude as the\nmembrane mass) and the stiffness (through the cabling).\nThe solution is to use contact-less measurement techniques.\nDepending on the rigidization technique, testing on the\nground may be difficult. Some techniques like ultraviolet or\nthermal curing, or metal-layer stretching are irreversible.\nTechniques relying on the space environment for rigidiza-\ntion, e.g. solar ultraviolet or thermal curing and dehydration\nrequire a simulation of this environment for on-ground\ntesting.\n\nThe current deployment methods are directed at mem-\nbers such as tubes and struts. Normally these members are\nused to move the remainder of the inflatable system into\nposition for inflation. Deployment methods must keep the\ndeploying inflatable structure within a predictable envelope,\nand provide a well-defined deployment rate that is slow\nenough to prevent significant loads on the spacecraft. They\nmust also provide restraint for the structure during launch.\nSeveral techniques are available\n\u2022 Roll-out method: This method is similar to the well-\n\nknown party favor. Embedded mechanisms (springs,\nVelcro, etc.) cause the tube to unroll in a prescribed plane\nand provide resistance to unrolling.\n\n\u2022 Mandrel method: The inflated beam is extended in a\nstraight telescopic motion with some degree of beam\nstiffness during the deployment.\n\n\u2022 Fan-folded method: The deployment resistance is pro-\nvided by the bending strength of the tube itself.\n\n\u2022 Accordion method: The boom is folded in an accordion-\npattern. The deployment resistance is then guaranteed by\nreleasing the accordion petals in a controlled manner.\n\n9.16 Further Reading\n\n9.16.1 Standards\n\n\u2022 Structural General Requirements ECSS-E-ST-32C Rev.\n1, 15/11/2008\n\n\u2022 Fracture Control ECSS-E-ST-32-01C Rev. 1, 6/3/2009\n\u2022 Structural Design and Verification of Pressurized Hard-\n\nware, ECSS-E-ST-32-02C Rev. 1, 15/11/2008\n\u2022 Structural Finite Element Models, ECSS-E-ST-32-03C,\n\n31/7/2008\n\u2022 Materials, ECSS-E-ST-32-08C Rev. 1, 21/7/2008\n\u2022 Structural Factors of Safety for Space Flight Hardware,\n\nECSS-E-ST-32-10C Rev. 1, 6/3/2009\n\u2022 Modal Survey Assessment, ECSS-E-ST-32-11C Rev. 1,\n\n21/7/2008,\n\u2022 Space product assurance: Materials, mechanical parts and\n\nprocesses, ECSS-Q-ST-70C, March 2009\n\u2022 NASA Standard Materials and Processes Requirements\n\nfor Spacecraft, NASA-STD- (I)-6016\n\u2022 Verification, ECSS-E-ST-10-02C, 6/3/2009\n\u2022 Testing, ECSS-E-10-03A, 15/2/2002 (superseded)\n\u2022 Testing, ECSS-E-ST-10-03C, Draft 12.5, 4/3/2011 (in\n\nreview)\n\n9.16.2 Handbooks\n\n\u2022 Adhesive Bonding Handbook, ECSS-E-HB-32-21A, 20/\n3/2011\n\n\u2022 Insert Design Handbook, ECSS-E-HB-32-22A, 20/3/\n2011\n\n\u2022 Threaded Fasteners Handbook, ECSS-E-HB-32-23A, 10/\n4/2010\n\n\u2022 Buckling of Structures, ECSS-E-HB-32-24A, 24/3/2010\n\u2022 Spacecraft Load Analysis, ECSS-E-HB-32-26A, TBD\n\nissue date\n\u2022 Structural Acoustics Design Manual, ESA PSS-03-204,\n\nMarch 1996\n\u2022 Mechanical Shock Design and verification Handbook,\n\nESA Contract No 20503/06/NL/Sfe, 15/9/2011 (will be\nissued as ECSS Handbook)\n\n\u2022 Space Product Assurance, Data for selection of space\nmaterials and processes ECSS-Q-70-71A, Rev 1, 18 June\n2004\n\n9 Structure, Mechanisms and Deployables 245\n\n\n\n\u2022 Space Product Assurance, Materials, mechanical parts\nand processes ECSS-Q-ST-70C, 6 March 2009\n\n\u2022 Space Product Assurance, Material selection for con-\ntrolling stress-corrosion cracking, ECSS-Q-ST-70-36C, 6\nMarch 2009\n\n\u2022 Space Product Assurance, Safety, ECSS-Q-ST-70-40C, 6\nMarch 2009\n\n\u2022 Space Product Assurance, Standard methods for\nmechanical testing of metallic materials ECSS-Q-ST-70-\n45C, Rev 1\n\n\u2022 Composite Materials Handbook, MIL-HDBK-17-2F\n\n9.16.3 NASA Handbooks and Papers\n\n\u2022 NASA STD-7003 Pyro shock Test Criteria, 1999\n\u2022 NASA SP-8019 Buckling of Thin-Walled Truncated\n\nCones\n\u2022 NASA SP-8007 Buckling of Thin-Walled Circular\n\nCylinders\n\u2022 H.N.

Patel\n\n10.1 Power System Basics\n\nThe electrical power system (EPS) generates, stores, con-\nditions, controls, and distributes power within the specified\nvoltage band to all bus and payload equipment. The pro-\ntection of the power system components in case of all\ncredible faults is also included. The basic components of the\nmost widely used power system are (1) solar array, (2) solar\narray drive, (3) battery, (4) battery charge and discharge\nregulators, (5) bus voltage regulator, and (6) switches, fuses,\nand distribution harness.\n\nPower requirements in very early satellites were several\nwatts. In today\u2019s communication satellites, it can be 20 kW\nor higher. Some strategic defense spacecraft power\nrequirement may be in hundreds of kilowatts and some\ndefense concepts require hundreds of megawatts of burst\npower. Solar radiation is the only external source of primary\nenergy available in space with reasonable flight heritage,\nalthough other concepts such as conductive wires have been\nconsidered. Any spacecraft not using solar energy must\ncarry on-board its own source of energy, such as the pri-\nmary battery, radioisotope, nuclear reactor, or chemical\nfuel. The conversion of the primary energy into electrical\nenergy may be photovoltaic (PV), thermoelectric (TE),\ndynamic alternator, or thermionic. Some energy storage\nmay also be required in many spacecraft to meet the load\npower requirement during eclipse or during any peak\ndemand period. Energy storage has been primarily by\nelectrochemical battery, although regenerative fuel cell and\nflywheel technologies are under development.\n\nFrom available options that are compatible with a given\nmission and its environment, the satellite-level optimization\nstudy determines the best combination of primary energy\n\nsource, energy conversion, and energy storage technologies.\nFinal selection must meet multiple criteria, but the primary\ncriteria are always low mass and low life cycle cost. Such\nselection is largely influenced by the power level 9 mission\nduration product as shown in Fig. 10.1, where the dividing\nlines among various options have large overlaps. Although\nthe PV-battery power system is the most common for Earth-\norbiting satellites, a variety of alternative power system\ntechnologies have been developed and flown for various\nspace missions [1]. The practical limit and performance\ncharacteristics of major power system options are summa-\nrized in Table 10.1.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Defense and NASA have also\nfunded the development and testing of proto-flight solar\narray designs that could yield a specific power of over\n100 W/kg, a factor of 3 greater than the state of the art and a\nfactor of 5 greater than the state of the practice. The\nadvanced designs under consideration integrate three\npromising technologies [2]: (1) flexible copper indium\ndiselenide thin-film PV cells, (2) smart mechanisms using\nshape memory metal, and (3) multi-functional lightweight\nstructures. An important criterion in application of a new\ntechnology is the flight qualification status. Any new com-\nponent is subject to time-consuming and expensive testing to\nprove its ability to withstand launch and space environments.\n\n10.2 Photovoltaic-Battery System\n\nThe solar energy and PV-battery power system is widely\nused in Earth orbiting satellites. The solar flux received from\nthe Sun varies with the distance squared. Earth\u2019s orbit\naround the Sun is approximately circular with a slight\neccentricity of 0.01672. The distance, therefore, varies\nwithin \u00b10.01672 times the average distance between the\nSun and the Earth, which is 149.6 million km, defined as one\nastronomical unit (au) of distance. Thus, the solar flux varies\n\nM. R. Patel (&)\nU.S. Merchant Marine Academy, Kings Point, NY, USA\n\nM. Macdonald and V. Badescu (eds.), The International Handbook\nof Space Technology, Springer Praxis Books, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_10,\n? Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014\n\n249\n\n\n\nover (1 \u00b1 0.01672)2 or 1 \u00b1 0.034 of the yearly average. For\nmany years, the average solar radiation in Earth orbit was\ntaken as 1,358 \u00b1 5 W/m2 on a surface normal to the Sun.\nMeasurements reported by Frohlich [3] showed a higher\naverage value of 1,377 \u00b1 5 W/m2, however the conserva-\ntive number of (1,358 - 5) = 1,353 W/m2 continues in\nwide use, particularly for power system sizing. Recall from\nSect. 3.2.3 that the ASTM E490 Standard Solar Constant and\nZero Air Mass (AM0) Solar Spectral Irradiance has an\nintegrated power of 1,366.1 W/m2; an ISO standard is also\navailable, see ISO-21348. Since the ecliptic and equatorial\nplanes are inclined to each other by 23.45?, the angle of\nincidence of the sunlight on an uncontrolled geostationary\nsatellite\u2019s solar arrays varies from 66.55? to 90?. The cor-\nresponding incident solar flux varies from 91.75 % on a\nsolstice day to 100 % on an equinox day. However, the\nsatellite on equinox days encounters the longest eclipse once\nper day when the Earth blocks the sunlight from illuminating\nthe satellite.\n\nAlternative PV-battery architectures are depicted in\nFig. 10.2. The direct energy transfer (DET) from the solar\narray to the load is best for the overall system efficiency. In\nthe DET category are (1) a sunlight regulated bus in which\nthe excess solar array current (if any during sunlight) is\nshunted to the ground in order to maintain the bus voltage in\na narrowband and the bus voltage during eclipse is the\n\nbattery voltage. And, (2) a fully regulated bus in which the\nbus voltage is regulated within a narrowband during the\nentire orbit. The other option is (3) a peak power tracking\n(PPT) architecture in which a series regulator matches the\nload and the source characteristics to extract the maximum\npower from the solar array. Power loss of several percent in\nthe PPT regulator sometimes nullifies the gain in power\nfrom solar array. The PPT architecture may be suitable for a\nmission operating over wide orbit parameters. However, the\nsunlight or fully regulated bus generally leads to the opti-\nmized design for large high-power satellites.\n\n10.2.1 Solar Array\n\nThe solar array is made of numerous PV cells mounted on a\nbase substrate and connected in a series\u2013parallel combination\nto obtain the desired voltage and current. Each cell can be of\nany of the following types: (1) single crystal silicon, (2)\ngallium arsenide, (3) semi-crystalline or polycrystalline, (4)\nthin film, (5) amorphous, or (6) multi-junction. As of 2012, a\nnew class of ultra-light, high-efficiency solar cell has been\ndeveloped by the U.S. Department of Energy. It is the inverted\nmetamorphic multijunction (IMM) with the conversion effi-\nciency of 42.3 \u00b1 2.5 % as measured by the U.S. National\nRenewable Energy Laboratory. The tests were made on In-\nGaP/GaAs/InGaAs three-junction cells with concentration of\n406 Suns on Earth (atmospheric mass, AM, 1.5) and cell\ntemperature of 250 ?C [4]. These cells consist of multiple thin\nfilms in layers that allow the cell to capture more of the solar\nspectrum and convert it into electrical power. The maximum\nreported efficiency is slightly better than 41.4 % achieved by\nthe Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems.\n\nThe IMM cells, primarily developed for terrestrial\napplications at present, are also developed for the space\nsatellite market by companies like Emcore and Spectrolab.\nThe IMM solar array in space without concentration could\n\n10 MW \n\nSolar concentrator-\nPV-Battery \n\n100 kW \nSolar concentrator-\n\nDynamic \n\n10 kW \n\n1 MW \n\nRadio isotope-TE \n\nWeeks\n\n1 kW \nSolar PV-Battery\n\nChemical-Dynamic \n\nPrimary battery \n100W \n\nNuclear reactor-Dynamic\n\nNuclear reactor-TE\n\nFuel cell\n\n10 W \nDays Months Years\n\n100 MW \n(Burst) \n\nFig. 10.1 Optimum primary\nenergy sources for various power\nlevels and mission durations\n\nTable 10.1 Practical limit and performance of various power system\noptions\n\nPower system\noption\n\nPractical power\nlimit (kW)\n\nNet system\nefficiency (%)\n\nSpecific\npower\n\nSolar-PV 20\u201330 15\u201330 5\u201310 W/\nkg\n\nIsotope-TE 1 7\u201315 5\u201310 W/\nkg\n\nNuclear-TE 100\u2013300 7\u201315 \u2013\n\n250 M.

The key features of these two basic\ntypes of solar panels are given in Table 10.2.\n\nThe steady state equivalent electrical circuit of a PV cell\n(and also of a PV panel by series\u2013parallel scaling) is shown\nin Fig. 10.5. The cell acts as a constant current source\nshunted by a diode. In the circuit parameters, the series\nresistance Rs represents the internal resistance to the current\nflow, which is primarily due to the resistivity of the mate-\nrial. The shunt resistance represents the leakage current\nacross the junction. It depends on the p-n junction depth, the\n\nimpurities, and the contact resistance. The value of Rsh is\ninversely related with the leakage current to ground. In an\nideal PV cell, Rs = 0 (no series loss), and Rsh = ? (no\nleakage to ground). In a typical high quality 2.0 9 2.5 cm\nsilicon cell, Rs = 0.05\u20130.10 X and Rsh = 200\u2013300 X. The\nPV conversion efficiency is sensitive to small variations in\nRs, but is insensitive to variations in Rsh. The value of Rsh\naffects the constant current slope, whereas the value of Rs\naffects the constant voltage slope. A small increase in Rs can\ndecrease the PV output significantly. Since the magnitudes\nof the diode current and the resistances Rs and Rsh vary with\ntemperature, the cell output and the conversion efficiency\ndecrease with increasing temperature.\n\n10.2.1.1 P\u2013V and I\u2013V Characteristics\nThe current versus voltage (I\u2013V) characteristic of the PV\ncell in sunlight is shown in Fig. 10.6a, where two important\nparameters for characterizing the cell performance are the\nopen circuit voltage Voc and the short circuit current Isc. The\nshort circuit current is measured by shorting the output\nterminals and measuring the terminal current under full\nillumination. Ignoring the small diode and ground leakage\ncurrents under zero terminal voltage, Isc is the photocurrent\n\nSolar \nstring  \n\nSun/horizon sensors \n\nReceive antenna \n\nPV array  \n\nPower switch 1 \n\nTransmit antenna \n\nPower switch 2 \n\nBleed  \nresistor \n\ncamera \ndamper \n\nFig. 10.4 Body mounted solar array with bleed resistor in each solar string\n\nTable 10.2 Key features of 3-axis stabilized and spin-stabilized satellites\n\n3-axis stabilized flat wings Spin-stabilized round body\n\nBias or zero momentum maintains the stability Inherently stiff due to rotational inertia\n\nComplex attitude control Simple mechanical structure\n\nFull solar array normal to the Sun generates power all the time Only 1/3rd of the solar array generates power at any time\n\nCan have high power by adding solar panels on wings Power limited by body size that fits the launch vehicle\n\nGreat flexibility in design Less flexibility in design\n\nSuitable for large satellites Suitable for small satellites\n\nFig. 10.5 Equivalent electrical circuit of solar cell\n\n252 M. R. Patel\n\n\n\nIs. The current under this condition is the maximum current\nthe cell can deliver. The bottom right of the curve at zero\ncurrent is the open circuit voltage measured with the output\nterminals open. The maximum photo voltage is produced\nunder the open circuit voltage. The I\u2013V curves over a full\nrange are developed from the test data at various illumi-\nnations, temperatures, and ionized radiation doses.\n\nThe product of voltage and current outputs is the output\npower, which is plotted in Fig. 10.6b. The cell produces no\npower at zero voltage or zero current, and produces the\nmaximum power at a voltage corresponding to the knee\npoint of the I\u2013V curve. This is why the PV power circuits\nare designed such that the panel operates closed to the knee-\npoint, slightly on the left-hand side, where the cell operates\napproximately as a constant current source.\n\nThe basic requirements of solar cells for space applications\nare generally described in MIL-STD-83576 by the U.S. Air\nForce. The cell specifications for general use in space are\ndefined by AIAA Standards-115 and -116. The ISO Technical\nCommittee C20 has issued ISO-15387 for the aircraft and\nspace vehicles and this is endorsed by American National\nStandard Institute. NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion laboratory (JPL)\noften performs such tests in aircraft and balloons at 35 km\nheight. Comparing such tests conducted by one organization\nwith another is difficult. For example, in a round-robin test by\nsix organizations to ISO-15387, including tests conducted at\nJPL and in the PV engineering test bed at NASA\u2019s Glenn\nResearch Center, the results showed up to 3 % deviations on\nthe same cell. The cell temperature coefficient is extremely\nsensitive to solar spectrum, and can vary several fold, making\nthe spectrum duplication in tests extremely important. For\nthis reason, power engineers allow 3 % margin for standard\ncells, and perhaps more for multi-junction cells, as the pos-\nsible error in power generation estimates using the test results.\n\n10.2.1.2 Array Performance\nMajor factors influencing the electrical performance of the\nsolar array are solar intensity, Sun angle, and the operating\ntemperature. The I\u2013V characteristic of a PV array reduces in\n\nmagnitude at lower Sun intensity with a small reduction in\nvoltage a shown in Fig. 10.7. However, the photo conversion\nefficiency of the cell is insensitive to solar illumination in the\npractical working range. Figure 10.8 shows that the efficiency\nis practically the same at full Sun (1,353 W/m2) and 1/2 Sun,\nand starts to fall off rapidly only below 1/4 Sun (340 W/m2).\n\nThe cell output current is given by Is = I0 cos h, where\nI0 is the photocurrent with normal Sun (h = 0). The cosine\nlaw holds well for Sun angles ranging from 0 to about 50?,\nbeyond which the electrical output deviates significantly\nfrom the cosine value. The cell generates no power beyond\n85?, although the mathematical prediction would give\n7.5 % power generation. The actual power versus angle\ncurve is called the Kelly cosine, which is useful to assess\naccurately the power available from the Sun at low angles\nduring transfer orbit.\n\nWith increasing temperature, the short circuit current of\nthe cell increases, whereas the open circuit voltage decreases\nas shown in Fig. 10.9; as the increase in current is much less\nthan the decrease in voltage, the net effect is the decrease in\n\nConstant power load  \n\nKnee \npoint \n\nat knee point \n\n0 0 \n\n(a) (b)Fig. 10.6 Solar array output\ncharacteristics and constant\npower load curves. a I\u2013V\ncharacteristic. b P\u2013V\ncharacteristic\n\nFull Sun\n\nSun intensity\n\neclipse \n\n\u00bd Sun\n\n\u00bc Sun \n\n0 \n\nFig. 10.7 Solar array current versus voltage at various illumination\nlevels\n\n10 Electrical Power 253\n\n\n\npower, which is quantitatively evaluated by examining the\neffects on current and voltage separately. Say that I0 and V0\nare the short circuit current and the open circuit voltage at\nreference temperature T, and a and b are their temperature\ncoefficients in units of A/?C and V/?C, respectively. If the\noperating temperature is increased by DS, then the new\ncurrent and voltage are given by Isc \u00bc \u00f0I0 \u00fe aDT\u00de and\nVoc \u00bc \u00f0V0 \u00fe bDT\u00de. Since the operating current and voltage\nchange approximately in the same proportion as the short\ncircuit current and open circuit voltage, respectively, the\nnew power P \u00bc V I \u00bc \u00f0I0 \u00fe a DT\u00de ? \u00f0V0 \u00fe bDT\u00de.

Therefore, the power varies\napproximately as P \u00bc P0\u00f01? 0:005DT\u00de, which indicates\nthat for every 1 ?C rise in the operating temperature, the\nsilicon cell power output decreases by about 0.50 %.\n\nFigure 10.10 depicts the power output versus voltage\ncharacteristic at two operating temperatures. It shows that the\nmaximum power generated at the lower temperature is higher.\nThus, cold temperatures are better for the PV cell for power\ngeneration. However, the two Pmax points are not at the same\nvoltage. In order to extract maximum power at all tempera-\ntures, the PV system must be designed such that the array\noutput voltage can increase to V2 for capturing Pmax2 at lower\ntemperature, and can decrease to V1 for capturing Pmax1 at\nhigher temperatures. If the array is operating at a fixed reg-\nulated voltage, the higher power generation capability at cold\ntemperatures cannot be utilized by the loads, and the excess\npower from the cell must be wasted in shunt circuits. The peak\npower all the time, regardless of the temperature, can be\ncaptured and utilized only by using the PPT architecture.\n\nThe array undergoes a wide temperature cycle in each\norbit. During sunlight, the front face rises to 50\u201360 ?C and\nthe back face to 40\u201350 ?C. The solar array temperature is\ndetermined by the thermal equation: (Solar flux ? Earth\u2019s\nalbedo ? Earth\u2019s thermal radiation ? Heat coming from\nadjacent components of the spacecraft) = (Electrical power\noutput ? Heat radiated back into space). During eclipse in\nGEO, the temperature drops exponentially to as low as -\n175 ?C. The time constant depends on the mass composi-\ntion of the array components, and is typically 30\u201360 min.\nThe front to back face temperature gradient for a rigid array\nwith face sheets made of either aluminum (obsolete) or\n\nPhotoconversion efficiency (%) \n\n100 \n\n40 \n\n600\n\n20 \n\n900\n\n80 \n\n60 \n\n 0 300 1,200 1,500 \n\nSolar flux (W/m2) \n\nFig. 10.8 Photoconversion efficiency remains constant over wide\nrange of solar flux up to 1/4 Sun\n\n 0 \n\n125 \n\n50 \n\n100 \n\n25 \n\n150 \n\n100 \n\n75 \n\n50 200 \n\nCold at 180\u00b0C \n\n At operating temp. +60\u00b0C \n\nVoltage (%) \n\nCurrent (%) \n\n_\n\nFig. 10.9 Temperature effect on I\u2013V curve of solar array\n\nPower (%)\n\n0\n\n100\n\n100\n\n50\n\n150\n\n200\n\n150\n\n50 200\n\nCold at ?180\u00b0C\n\nAt operating \ntemp. +60\u00b0C\n\nVoltage (%)\n\nFig. 10.10 Temperature effects on P\u2013V curve of solar array\n\n254 M. R. Patel\n\n\n\ngraphite epoxy (new designs) can be 5\u201310 ?C under steady\nSun and up to 20 ?C on sunlight snap after eclipse. Various\ntechniques are used to control the temperature of spacecraft\nparts over a full orbit. Figure 10.9 indicates that a typical\ncold array facing the Sun immediately after coming out of a\nlong eclipse in GEO develops about twice its normal\noperating voltage in steady sunlight.\n\nSolar array performance degrades due to two distinct\ngroups of factors. In the first group are the initial degradations\nat beginning-of-life (BOL) due to (1) cell mismatch in the\nassembly, (2) cell-to-cell wiring loss, (3) power loss in array\nand boom wires, and (4) plasma effects that cause leakage\ncurrent from the array to space. In the second group are the\naccumulated degradations up to the end-of-life (EOL) due to\nvarious environmental effects, such as (1) cumulative radi-\nation dose of the ionized particles, (2) effect of ultraviolet\nrays on the optical properties of cover glass, (3) mechanical\nstress cycles causing soldered joints to crack over time,\n(4) impacts of micrometeoroids and debris damaging solder\njoints and reducing power generating area of the cells, (5) flue\ngases changing the optical properties of cover glass,\n(6) bypass diode failure causing loss in the string current.\nTable 10.3 gives representative values of major degradation\nfactors for a typical medium Earth orbit, from which the total\ndegradation can be obtained as\n\nTotal degradation \u00bc BOL degradation\n\u00fe In-service degradation to EOL:\n\n\u00f010:2\u00de\n\n10.2.1.3 Peak Power Tracking\nSun tracking is required in order for the solar array to face\nthe Sun continuously as the spacecraft orbits the Earth. This\nis done by an actuator that follows the Sun like a sunflower.\nThere are two types of Sun trackers: (1) single-axis gimbals,\nwhich follow the Sun from east to west during the day, and\n(2) dual-axis gimbals that track the Sun from east to west\nduring the day and from north to south during the seasons of\nthe year. The dual axis tracking is done by two linear\nactuator motors, which aim at the Sun within 1? of accu-\nracy. The EPS provides a means of independently orienting\nand rotating the deployed north and south solar wings about\nthe pitch axis of the spacecraft. After the deployment,\nground control is involved in aligning the solar array to the\nSun. Once aligned, the array rotates by the clock time\nwithout ground intervention to maintain the Sun orientation.\nSome Sun pointing error cannot be avoided even after\nacquiring the normal Sun by the Sun sensor and then\ntracking by the solar array drive. The error generally comes\nfrom the cell flatness error of about 2? and the gimbal tol-\nerance error of about 3?. The total 5? error must be\naccounted for in the array design. The cosine of 5? is 0.996,\nwhich means a 5? Sun pointing error will reduce the power\ngeneration by 0.4 %.\n\nThe gimbal\u2019s motor drives the array module to face the\nSun to collect the maximum solar flux. However, that alone\ndoes not guarantee the maximum power output from the\nmodule. The module must electrically operate at the voltage\nthat corresponds to the peak power point Pmax under the\ngiven operating conditions. If the array is operating at\nvoltage V and current I on the I\u2013V curve, the power gen-\neration is P \u00bc VI watts. If the operation moves away from\nthe above point, such that the current is now (I ? DI), and\nthe voltage is (V ? DV), the new power is\nP\u00fe DP \u00bc \u00f0V \u00fe DV\u00de\u00f0I \u00fe DI\u00de. After ignoring a small term,\nthis equation simplifies to DP \u00bc \u00f0DVI \u00fe DIV\u00de. The DP\nshould be zero at the peak power point, which necessarily\nlies on a locally flat neighborhood as shown in Fig. 10.6b.\nTherefore\n\nAt Pmax point;\ndP\ndV\n\u00bc 0; which reduces to dV\n\ndI\n\u00bc ?V\n\nI\n:\n\n\u00f010:3\u00de\n\nNote that \u00f0dV=dI\u00de is the dynamic impedance and (V/I) is\nthe static impedance of the PV array, and the Pmax point is\nat the knee-point shown in Fig. 10.6a.\n\n10.2.2 Battery\n\nEnergy storage is required in order to meet the spacecraft\nload demand during the launch/injection phase, during\n\nTable 10.3 Degradation factors for 900 W satellite with a 15 year\noperational life in medium Earth orbit; 10,900 nm, 69? inclination;\nGPS II F orbit\n\nIsc factors\n\nNatural radiationa\n\nAssembly mismatch lossb 0.98\n\nCover glass charge particles 0.99\n\nCover glass coating (ITO)b 0.98\n\nUltraviolet rays 0.97\n\nPropellant contamination 0.98\n\nMicrometeoroid damage 0.98\n\nVoc factors\n\nNatural radiationa\n\nCover glass charge particles 0.99\n\nPmax factors\n\nNatural radiationc\n\nWiring loss (cell-to-cell)b 0.98\na Determined from the radiation fluence over the mission life\nb Beginning of life\nc Approximate value equal to the product of the Isc and Voc degra-\ndation factors can be used in top-level calculations only.

The most widely used energy storage\ntechnology is the rechargeable battery that stores energy in\nelectrochemical form. The battery is made of numerous\nelectrochemical cells assembled in series\u2013parallel combi-\nnation to obtain the required voltage and current. The cell\nstores energy at a low electrical potential. The cell voltage\ndepends solely on the electrochemistry, and not on the\nphysical size. Commonly used electrochemistries produces\n1.5\u20134.2 V when fully charged. The cell\u2019s ampere-hour (Ah)\nstorage capacity, denoted by C, depends on the physical\nsize. It is defined as the Ah charge that the cell can deliver\nat room temperature until it reaches a cut-off voltage of\nabout two-thirds of the fully charged cell voltage. The\nbattery can deliver C amperes for 1 h or C/n amperes for\nn hours. The cell capacity measures the Ah output at the\nterminals, not what is stored between the plates. A 1.5 V\ncell discharged to 1.0 V delivers practically the full\ncapacity of the cell, and delivers only a few percent more if\ndrained further to 0.1 V.\n\nThe battery voltage rating is stated in terms of the\naverage voltage during discharge. A higher-voltage battery\nrequires a greater number of cells in series. The product of\nvoltage and the Ah rating gives the energy rating in watt-\nhours (Wh) that the battery can deliver to a load from the\nfully charged state. The battery charge and discharge rates\nare stated in fractions of the capacity. For example, charg-\ning a 100 Ah battery at a 10 A rate is said to be charging at\nC/10 rate. Discharging this battery at C/2 rate means\ndrawing 50 A. At this rate, the battery will be fully dis-\ncharged in 2 h. The battery depth of discharge\nDoD \u00bc \u00f01?

Lithium-\npolymer (Li-poly) and nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) are\ntwo such examples in the commercial world.\n\nThe following figures of merit are often used in com-\nparing the relative performance of various electrochemist-\nries: (1) specific energy or gravimetric energy\ndensity = energy stored per unit mass, Wh/kg, (2) energy\ndensity or volumetric energy density = energy stored per\nunit volume, Wh/L, (3) cycle life = number of charge/\ndischarge cycles the battery can deliver while maintaining\n\nthe minimum required voltage, and (4) specific power and\npower density = power the battery can practically deliverer\nper kilogram of mass and liter of volume, respectively. It is\nsometimes necessary to think in terms of the power\nparameters also, since the internal resistances of the battery\nmay limit the rate at which the energy can be discharged\nwithin practical design limits.\n\nThe NiCd battery has served as the workhorse of the\nspacecraft industry since the earliest missions, and is still\nused in some missions. However, since the mid-1980s it has\nbeen replaced by NiH2 in general use due to NiCd\u2019s\nmemory effect\u2014loss of capacity after repeated use at low\nDoD. The NiH2 provides deeper DoD for comparable cycle\nlife, thus requiring lower Ah capacity, which translates into\nlighter weight. Today, the industry appears to be moving\ntowards lithium based batteries for potentially 2\u20135 times the\nspecific energy compared to NiH2. Lithium-ion has a\ncharge/discharge ratio and a round trip energy efficiency\nclose to unity at low depth of discharge. However, no single\nelectrochemistry can meet the wide range of space mission\nrequirements. All chemistries will perhaps continue in use\nwhere they fit the best for a minimum mass and cost design.\n\n10.2.2.1 Battery Performance\nThe battery works as a voltage source with small internal\nresistance. Its electrical circuit model has the internal\nelectrochemical voltage Ei with internal resistance Ri in\nseries. The Ei decreases and Ri increases linearly with the\nAh discharge. Quantitatively\n\nEi \u00bc Eo ? K1 ? DoD and Ri \u00bc Ro \u00fe K2 ? DoD \u00f010:5\u00de\n\nwhere E0 and R0 are internal voltage and internal resistance\nin a fully charged battery with DoD = 0, and K1 and K2 are\nelectrochemistry constants to be found by curve-fitting the\ntest data. The terminal voltage drops with increasing load\ncurrent I, such that VTerminal \u00bc Ei ? IRi, where Ei and Ri are\nfunctions of DoD. Thus, the terminal voltage is also a\nfunction of DoD as shown in Fig. 10.11 for NiH2 cell in one\nfull LEO orbit, discharging to various DoD levels during a\n36-min eclipse and then fully charging up before the next\norbit.\n\nThe design and operation of a battery requires certain\nsafety considerations. The most important is not to over-\ncharge the battery. Any overcharge above the trickle charge\nrate is converted into heat, which can explode the battery if\nallowed to build up beyond limit. This is particularly critical\nwhen the battery is charged directly from a dedicated\nphotovoltaic module without a charge regulator in small\nscience missions with short duration or infrequent eclipses.\nIn such cases, the array rating is kept below the continuous\ntrickle charge current that can be tolerated by the battery.\n\n256 M. R. Patel\n\n\n\n10.2.2.2 Battery Life\nThe battery\u2019s primary mode of failure is associated with\nelectrode wear due to repeated charge/discharge cycles. The\ncycle life depends strongly on the electrochemistry, depth of\ndischarge, and temperature, as depicted in Fig. 10.12 for\nNiCd and NiH2 batteries. The battery life also depends to a\nlesser degree on the electrolyte concentration, electrode\nporosity, and charge and discharge rates. The electrolyte\nconcentration makes significant difference in the cycle life\nof NiH2 cell. The cell with 26 % concentration gives a\ngreater cycle life than one with 31 % concentration.\n\nThe number of charge/discharge cycles in a satellite\nequals the number of eclipses during the mission life. It is at\nleast an order of magnitude greater in LEO than in GEO.\nSuch long cycle life requirement in LEO can be achieved\nonly by limiting the battery design to a low DoD, typically\n30 % in LEO as compared to 80 % in GEO. For this reason,\na LEO battery is proportionately much larger than a com-\nparable battery in GEO delivering the same Wh energy\nduring each discharge.\n\nIt is noteworthy from Fig. 10.12 that the life at given\ntemperature is an inverse function of the depth of discharge.\nIf the life is 100 units at 50 % DoD, then it would be about\n200 units at 25 % DoD. The cycle life? DoD product is\nroughly constant in the first approximation, although it\ndecreases with increasing temperature. Such is true for most\nelectrochemistries. This means that the battery at a given\ntemperature can deliver the same number of equivalent full\ncharges regardless of the depth of discharge. Phrased dif-\nferently, the total Wh energy that the battery can deliver\nover its life is roughly constant. The battery lasts propor-\ntionately longer if less energy is used per cycle. This\nobservation is useful in comparing the mass and cost of\nvarious battery options for a given application at the con-\nceptual design stage.\n\nOnce the electrochemistry and the number of parallel\nbatteries are settled, the battery design depends on system\nparameters such as (1) bus voltage and load current, (2)\ncharge and discharge rates and duration, (3) operating\ntemperature during charge and discharge, and (4) life in\nterms of number of charge and discharge cycles. The life\nconsideration is the dominant design driver in setting the Ah\nratings. Even when the load may be met with a smaller\ncapacity, the battery is oversized to meet the cycle life\nrequirement. For example, with the same Wh load, the\nbattery that must deliver twice as many cycles approxi-\nmately double the capacity.\n\nThe issue of in-orbit battery reconditioning is considered\nin Chap. 20.\n\n10.2.3 Power Electronics\n\nMajor power electronic components used in the spacecraft\nare (1) shunt regulator for bus voltage control during sun-\nlight, (2) battery charge converter (buck converter), and\n(3) battery discharge converter (boost converter). They\ncontrol the bus voltage and convert the voltage to match the\noperating voltages of various components. The voltage\nconversion is performed by solid-state semiconductor\ndevices used as controlled switches which are turned on and\noff at high frequency. Capacitors and inductors are used to\nstore energy when the switch is connected to the power\nsource. The stored energy is then discharged to continue\npowering the load when the switch is off. Transformers are\nused where needed.\n\n10.2.3.1 Switching Devices\nA variety of solid-state devices are used as controlled\nswitches. However, the devices commonly used in space are\n(1) metal-oxide semiconducting field effect transistor\n(MOSFET), (2) bipolar junction transistor (BJT), and\n(3) insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). The device\nselection depends on the required voltage, current, and\nswitching frequency. A common feature among these\ndevices is that all are three-terminal devices. Their gener-\nally used circuit symbols are shown in Fig. 10.13. The two\npower terminals 1 and 0 are connected in the main power\ncircuit. The control gate terminal G is connected to the\nauxiliary control circuit. In normal conducting operation,\nterminal 1 is generally at higher voltage than terminal 0.\nSince the device is primarily used for switching power on\nand off as required, it is functionally represented by a gate-\ncontrolled switch. In the absence of the gate control signal,\nthe device resistance between the power terminals is\nlarge\u2014the functional equivalence of an open switch. When\nthe control signal is applied at the gate, the device resistance\napproaches zero, making the device function like a closed\n\nDischarge Charge 1.5 \n\n1.2 \n\n40 \n\n1.1 \n\n60 \n\n1.4 \n\n1.3 \n\n1.0 \n20 80 100 \n\nCycle time from eclipse inception (minutes) \n 0 \n\n1.6 \n\n20% DoD  \n\n35% DoD \n\n60% DoD  \n\nCell voltage (V) \n\nEclipse Sunlight \n\nFig. 10.11 NiH2 cell voltage during one charge/discharge cycle at\nvarious DoD in LEO\n\n10 Electrical Power 257\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_20\n\n\nswitch. The current through the switching device has a\nmaximum saturation level regardless of the voltage applied\nbetween the power terminals 1 and 0.\n\nThe switch is triggered periodically on and off by a train\nof gate signals of suitable frequency. Within a separate\ntriggering (firing) circuit, a sharp rectangular signal is\nderived by comparing a voltage control signal with a tri-\nangular or sawtooth waveform. This on\u2013off drive is then\napplied to the gate of the semiconductor switch. Although\nthe control circuit has a distinct identity and very much\n\ndifferent design features, it is often incorporated into the\nmain power electronic component assembly. The transistor\nswitch is turned on and off at high frequency, typically at\n50\u2013200 kHz, and sometimes higher.

R. Patel\n\n\n\n10.2.3.2 Shunt Regulator\nAt the beginning of spacecraft life, the power output of the\nsolar array during sunlight normally exceeds the load plus\nthe battery charge requirements. The excess power must be\ndiverted (shunted) from the bus in order to control the bus\nvoltage. The shunt load can be a dump resistor, which\nwould convert the solar array power into heat. Such heat\ndissipation in the spacecraft body would pose a burden on\nthe thermal system in providing adequate cooling. An\nalternative commonly used in spacecraft is to shunt some of\nthe solar array strings to the ground. This forces the string to\noperate under short circuit condition, delivering Isc at zero\nvoltage. In the shunt mode, no power is delivered to the bus\nor to the ground. The photon energy remains on the array,\nraising the array temperature and ultimately dissipating the\nexcess power to space. The solar array is essentially being\nused as the thermal dissipater.\n\nFigure 10.14 depicts a typical shunt regulator where a\ntransistor is used as the switch. When the excess power is\navailable, the bus voltage will rise above the rated value.\nThis is taken as a signal to turn on the shunt switch across\nthe required number of solar array strings. Thus, the shunt is\nturned on or off by a transistor controlled by the bus voltage\nreference. For an array with many strings in parallel, the\nbasic configuration shown in Fig. 10.14 is used for each\nstring separately. The same gate signal is supplied to all\nmodules simultaneously in small power applications. For\nshunting large power, multiple shunt circuits are switched\non and off in sequence to minimize the switching transients\nand the resulting electromagnetic interference to the\nneighboring equipment. For fine voltage control, the last\nshunt to turn on is operated in the pulse width modulation\n(PWM) mode, while all others are fully on or off.\n\nAnother application of the shunt regulator is in small\nsatellites, where a dedicated solar array module is used to\ndirectly charge the battery without a battery charge regu-\nlator. When the battery is fully charged, the solar array\nmodule is shunted to ground by shorting the switch. This\nway, the battery is protected from overcharging.\n\n10.2.4 Distribution Harness\n\nThe power distribution harness includes the insulated con-\nductors, connectors, and the shield. Its mass is determined\nfrom the detailed layout and routing of all of the wiring\nrequired after the spacecraft has been well defined. For this\nreason, the harness mass is often considerably heavier than\nthat estimated at the preliminary design stage. A typical\nharness mass breakdown is (1) 30 % in wires between\npower boxes, (2) 20 % in solar array wires, (3) 30 % in\ncommand and telemetry wires, and (4) 20 % in all\nconnectors.\n\nThe wire size is measured in American Wire Gage\n(AWG) or in mm2 cross section in metric wire gage. The\nAWG and Birmingham (BWG) numbers are inverse mea-\nsures of the conductor\u2019s bare diameter, and are set on a log\nscale, i.e. AWG = 20 Log(0.325/diameter in inches). Thus,\nfor every one gage up, the diameter increases by a factor of\n1.1225 and the area by 1.26. The diameter doubles every six\ngages and the area doubles every three gages. The maxi-\nmum current carrying capacity (ampacity) of the wire in\nspace is less than that on the ground due to the absence of\nconvective cooling. This requires de-rating the wire am-\npacity for space applications from the ground-based rating.\nThe ampacity of various wires gages are listed in\nTable 10.5.\n\nThe most commonly used electrical conductor is copper\nfor its good performance and low cost. Annealed copper has\nhigh conductivity but low tensile strength. For this reason,\nwires thinner than AWG 20 are often required to use high\nstrength copper alloy 135, which has 40 % higher tensile\nstrength, and 10 % higher electrical resistance. Copper wire\ncoated with nickel or silver is used to resist corrosion and\noxidation. Tin plated wires are widely used on the ground,\nbut are forbidden in space due to the growth of whiskers.\n\nAluminum is sometimes used in power equipment where\nlightweight and/or low cost is desired. It is used in overhead\ntransmission lines and pole mounted power transformers on\nthe ground, and in some aircraft and commercial spacecraft\n\nComparator \nand Amplifier\n\nGate control \n\nSolar string \n\nIsolation \ndiode \n\nShunt \n\nBus \n\nL\nO\n\nA\nD\n\n \n\nFig. 10.14 Full shunt regulator\nfor bus voltage control\n\n10 Electrical Power 259\n\n\n\nharnesses. The performance of aluminum is compared with\ncopper in Table 10.6. For the same power loss or voltage\ndrop, copper can be replaced with aluminum of relative\nmass equal to resistivity by mass density product ratios.\nAluminum conductor, therefore, would theoretically have\n(2.830/1.724) 9 (2.70/8.89) = 0.50 or 50 % of the copper\nmass for the same electrical performance. However, in\npractice, aluminum does not produce 50 % mass saving due\nto various mechanical reasons.\n\nInsulation is designed to withstand the rated and abnor-\nmal transient voltages. The transient voltage can be higher\nby several times the rated value. The insulation design must\npreclude corona and arcing at pressures below 10 torr, and\nwithstand the radiation environment and atomic oxygen. In\nhigh radiation spacecraft, such as GPS, the system specifi-\ncations often require that silicon-insulated wire not be used\nand that the solar array wires and interconnects be welded to\nwithstand high radiation.\n\nA cable shield is wrapped around the wire bundle to\nprevent electromagnetic interference from entering the\ncable or radiating out. The shield can weigh 15\u201340 % of the\ncable weight. The shield options are braid versus tape, and\ncopper versus aluminum. The braid is used when extreme\nflexibility is required. Its mass as compared to the wire\nconductor is about 40 % for flat cables and 20 % for round\ncables. Thin 2-mil (50 lm) copper vapor deposited on\nMylar or Kapton tapes are widely used. The tape is applied\non the cable with insulation touching the cable, followed by\nanother layer on the top. The shield mass with such tapes is\nroughly 80 % of that with braid.\n\n10.2.5 Solar Array Drive\n\nThe solar array drive and array drive electronics (SAD/\nADE) together provide the capability of rotating the solar\npanels with respect to the spacecraft body. The operation of\nthe SAD is controlled by decoded uplink commands from\nthe on-board computer (OBC). It receives a timing clock\nand a synchronizing signal from the OBC. In the 3-axis\nstabilized 2-wing geostationary satellite, one axis is always\naligned with the local normal to the Sun and another axis\nalong the orbit normal. Two sets of open loop (clock con-\ntrolled) solar array drive motors maintain the Sun orienta-\ntion. A brushless DC stepper motor rotates each panel\nseparately. The slip rings on the SAD shaft provide the\ninterface between the rotating panel and the fixed Earth-\npointing spacecraft body. One SAD controls the north panel\nand the other controls the south panel. The two are\n\nTable 10.5 Maximum allowable amperes in wires and connector pins of same gage\n\nAWGa Diameter (in.)

Each SAD\nhas only one mechanical assembly, but has redundant motor\nwindings and redundant position telemetry potentiometers.\nOnly one set of windings is powered at a time. The\nredundant windings are fully isolated to prevent failure\npropagation. The reliability of 0.99 is typical for both sides\ncombined over a 15 year mission.\n\nIn an Earth orbiting satellite, the solar array is rotated\nonce per orbit by the SAD to track the Sun at or near normal\nangle. The rotation is rate-servo controlled. The body\ninformation and position errors are computed by OBC to\nderive rate control signals. The nominal rate of rotation is\nmission specific and is primarily determined by the\nrespective orbit characteristics. Using slip rings and carbon\nbrushes is one way of providing the rotary joint between the\nrotating array and the satellite body. The control signals for\nthe required rotation rate come from the telemetry, tracking\nand command (TT&C) system, which also selects the\nrotation direction. The mass of each SAD/ADE assembly\ncan be 5\u201310 kg in GEO communications satellites.\n\nThe SAD/ADE provides telemetry defining its status and\nthat of the solar panel. Each unit provides a potentiometer\nvoltage signal which is directly proportional to the angular\nposition of the panel shaft, ranging from 0 V at 0? to +5 V at\n360?. The typical SAD uses a four-phase, 16-pole permanent\nmagnet switched-reluctance stepper motor to drive a zero-\nbacklash harmonic drive. Each phase coil resistance is in the\n50\u2013100 X range. A vanadium-cobalt steel stator core and a\nneodymium-iron-boron permanent magnet rotor provide\nhigh torque per unit mass. The rotor is typically on 440C\nstainless steel ball bearings and a titanium case. Each SAD/\nADE draws power from the essential battery bus on a\nswitchable and protected output line. The peak input power is\nabout 10 W and the average power about 1 W. Switch-mode\npower pulses applied to the stator coils at a suitable frequency\ndrive the motor. The grounding scheme for the ADE uses\nfour separate grounds, one each for the power, signal and\ncommunications circuits, and one for all equipment chassis.\n\n10.2.6 Electro-explosive Deployment\n\nElectro-explosive deployment (EED) is the traditional\ndeployment device. It is also known as pyro-technic ord-\nnance. It uses electrical energy to ignite the squib of\nexplosive powder. The resulting force deploys the solar\narray or other component, typically under a spring-loaded\nforce. The EED will be ignited when an applied current\nimposes a certain amount of energy upon the squib within a\nspecified time. For safety reasons, the squib must withstand\n\ncertain minimum energy without igniting. The typical EED\nis rated at 1A-1 W for no fire, and 4A-4 W for sure fire.\n\nThe EED requires heavy shielding and great care with\nregard to the electromagnetic interference (EMI) pickup.\nMoreover, the EED explosive is thermal and shock sensi-\ntive. Therefore, its installation is sometimes done at the\nlaunch pad, which costs much more than at the factory.\nMost manufacturers install EED squibs at the factory and\ntransport the spacecraft as class 1 explosive (sensitive to\nthermal and shock environment), which is also expensive.\n\nThe EED harness is routed separately from the power\nand signal harness in order to minimize the EMI concerns\nfor safety. The EED technology, although used for several\ndecades, has some disadvantages, such as (1) all spacecraft\ncomponents must be designed to withstand severe pyro\nshock excitation, and (2) high safety related costs in doc-\numenting and reporting alerts, and complying with all other\nstringent regulations. The newer EMI-free alternatives are\nlaser initiated and use shape-memory metal for deployment.\n\n10.2.7 Design Process and Trades\n\nOnce the spacecraft-level trades are settled, the power\nsystem engineer focuses on the internal EPS-level trades\nthat may reduce the mass and cost. The power system mass\nas a percentage of the satellite dry mass can range from\n25 % in LEO satellites to 45 % in GEO satellites. Saving\neven a few percent of power system mass can result in\nappreciable savings at the spacecraft level. The first task of\nthe power-system design engineer is to select the optimum\nprimary energy source.\n\nThe bus voltage level is selected based on the power\nlevel. Early spacecraft with loads of a few hundred watts\nused 28 V dc, which was primarily based on the product\nspecifications readily available for the aircraft power system\nat the time. Since then, the power levels have increased\nsignificantly. With power being the product of voltage and\ncurrent, a high power requires a high-voltage bus in order to\nkeep the current level at a reasonable level. Otherwise, the\nexcessive power loss in switching devices and I2R loss in\nconductors reduce the system efficiency considerably.\nToday\u2019s spacecraft bus voltages, somewhat standardized by\nthe product lines of various manufactures are 28, 50, 70, and\n100 V. The ISS has 160 V DC solar array voltage and\n120 V DC distribution voltage [6]. The 160 V limit comes\nprimarily from the bare conductor interaction with space\nplasma, particularly in LEO. Above 160 V, the solar array\ncurrent leakage to plasma increases exponentially with\npotential sparking above 180\u2013200 V.\n\n10 Electrical Power 261\n\n\n\nVoltages higher than 160 V can be used in low Earth\norbit with insulated cables covered in a shielded enclosure,\nand by encapsulating (grouting with insulating compound)\nall solar cell edges, connectors, and circuit board. For early\nspace station designs [6], NASA considered 120 V dc,\n270 V DC and 440 V 20-kHz ac. It finally selected 160 V\nDC for solar array voltage and 120 V DC for distribution\nbus, with necessary step-down converters for existing 28 V\nDC hardware. For any spacecraft, the influence factors in\nthe voltage selections are (1) power level as the primary\ndriver, (2) space environment and space plasma, (3) the\nPaschen minimum breakdown voltage between bare con-\nductors, (4) human safety, and (5) availability of compo-\nnents, such as semiconductor devices, power distribution\nand protection devices, tantalum capacitors, etc.\n\nNext, the power generation and energy storage technol-\nogies are jointly selected to optimize the total power sys-\ntem. The major driving factors are the payload power level,\nthe operating orbit, mission life, number of satellites in the\nprogram procurement, etc. For the self-derived satellite-\nlevel load requirement, the trade study is done to select\nvarious key component for the power system, such as the\nPV cell, cover glass thickness for radiation protection, array\nsubstrate, battery electrochemistry and cell Ah rating,\npower converter topologies, etc. An example of such trades\nis displayed in Fig. 10.15. As the trade study proceeds from\nleft to right, the selections made are shown by continuing\narrows. Since the solar array and the battery are two com-\nponents that primarily contribute to the power system mass\nand cost, they get more attention and see more rapid tech-\nnological changes than other components. They impact not\nonly the EPS design, but also other spacecraft systems.\n\n10.2.8 Power System Requirements\n\nThe electrical power system requirements are seldom found\nin the customer specifications for the spacecraft under\nprocurement. They are derived from the spacecraft-level\nrequirements and in-house trade studies. The EPS self-\nderived requirements are based on various analyses, but the\nfinal requirements generally come from the operational\norbit analyses. However, the transfer and other orbits must\nalso be analyzed to ascertain that the proposed requirements\nare met in the worst case. Major self-derived requirements\nof the power system are (1) solar array EOL power level,\n(2) solar array pointing and rotation for Sun orientation,\n(3) battery Ah capacity, (4) battery DoD and charge control,\n(5) bus voltage regulation, and (6) EMI, EMC and elec-\ntrostatic discharge, ESD.\n\nThe power-system design team performs the following\nworst-case analyses to establish detailed EPS requirements\n\u2022 Power flow to determine the component ratings and heat\n\ndissipations\n\u2022 Energy balance to determine the battery rating\n\u2022 Voltages at the terminals of various equipment\n\u2022 EOL and BOL solar array power generation capability\n\u2022 Load switching and fault response, including major fuse-\n\nclearing events\n\u2022 Bus stability under various feedback control loops\n\u2022 Energy balance in operational and transfer orbits\n\u2022 dV=dt specifications, which come from three sources\n\n\u2013 voltage fall after a short circuit fault until the fuse clears\n\u2013 voltage rise after the fuse clears\n\u2013 sudden loss of power during integration and testing.\n\nPo\nw\n\ner\n s\n\nys\nte\n\nm\n \n\nre\nqu\n\nir\nem\n\nen\nts\n\n \n\nEnergy source \n\n Nuclear \n\n Solar \n\n.Chemical\n\nVoltage level \n\n 28 V  \n\n 70 V \n\n Higher \n\n 100 V \n\n 120 V \n\nPV cell \n\n SiCr \n\nSiMJ\n\n GaAs\n\n SiAm\n\nArchitecture  \n\n Fully-reg\n\n Sun-reg \n\n Special \n\nCover glass \nthickness \n\n 0.1 mm\n\n 0.2 mm \n\n 0.5 mm \n\n 0.3 mm\n\nBattery \nchemistry \n\n NiH2\n\n NiCd\n\n Other \n\n Li-ion\n\nBattery cell \ncapacity \n\n 50 Ah \n\n 75 Ah \n\n Other \n\n 100 Ah\n\nBattery charge \n /discharge \nconverters \n\n Separate   \n.buck-boost \n\nBi-directional \nresonant \n\n Coupled  \n.inductors \n\nSolid box denotes selection \n\nFig. 10.15 Power system\ndesign trades flow-chart\n\n262 M. R. Patel\n\n\n\n10.3 Power System Performance\n\n10.3.1 Energy Balance and Power\nManagement\n\nBy designing the spacecraft electrical power system, what is\nreally meant is designing the electrical energy system. The\nsatellite has a limited time in orbit to generate power, but\nthe loads need to be powered all the time. The battery stores\nenergy during sunlight and delivers it to the loads during\neclipse. The energy balance between the battery charge and\ndischarge over one orbit period must be on average positive\nwith some margin. Otherwise, the battery would walk to\ntotal depletion in a matter of time. The power to and from\nvarious components must therefore be managed in order to\nmaintain the energy balance in both the transfer orbit and\nthe operational orbit.\n\nThe energy balance analysis is performed at the design\nstage by simulating the power flow and energy account on a\ncomputer. The program is generally structured to allow\nanalyses on the baseline design and its derivatives, and to\nanswer many what if questions in normal and abnormal\noperation. Such analysis is performed during all phases of\nthe mission for a given launch date (year, month and day).\nVarious fault conditions, including battery cell failures\n(short or open) and loss of a solar array circuit, are simu-\nlated to determine energy balance under the worst-case\ncondition(s). Other equally important uses of the energy\nbalance computer program are\n\u2022 Determine and/or optimize the load capability of a given\n\nEPS\n\u2022 Derive component ratings based on maximum power flow\n\nin each component\n\u2022 Determine power dissipation for thermal design of each\n\ncomponent, particularly the battery, since its performance\nis highly temperature sensitive.\nThe computer program for such analysis is generally\n\ndeveloped around variable parameters with no hard-coded\nnumbers. This allows greater flexibility in using the tool for\na wide variety of applications. Figure 10.16 depicts EPS\ncomponents contributing to the energy balance program.\nThe basic equations for currents and battery DoD that are\n\ncomputed typically every second or so in the energy balance\nanalysis are\n\nDuring sunlight; Isa \u00bc Iload \u00fe Ichrg \u00fe Ishunt ?

Due to the\nnon-linear nature of the battery cell and solar array per-\nformance parameters, the program typically uses static\nlookup tables to determine the cell performance character-\nistics as a multi-variable function of the battery current,\ntemperature, state of charge, and the solar array operating\nvoltage. Programming with a computer language, instead of\nmodeling on a spreadsheet, significantly improves the\ncapability of the program.\n\n10.3.1.1 Dynamic Performance and Stability\nThe dynamic bus impedance and the control loop gain\ninfluence the dynamic performance of the power system\nunder an internal or external transient perturbation. Key\nperformance attributes coming out of the dynamic study are\nthe bus voltage ripples, transient deviations, fault and fuse-\nclearing transients, and the control loop stability under\nharmonic ripple excitation. On the other hand, the static\nperformance under a slow change or after the dynamic\nresponse has settled, is largely influenced by the static\nimpedance of the bus. The bus voltage change long after a\nload change is an example of static performance. Since the\ndynamic and static bus impedances are similarly defined,\nthey are jointly covered in the following section.\n\n10.3.1.2 Bus Impedance\nA complex electrical network having a number of sources\nand loads between any two terminals can always be reduced\nto a simple Thevenin equivalent source model consisting of\none source voltage Vs with an internal series impedance\n\nShunt \ndissipator \nassembly  \n\nSolar \narray  \n\nBattery \ncharge \nregulator\n\nBattery \nvoltage \nregulator \n\nLoad  \n\nFig. 10.16 Power system components participating in energy balance\n\n10 Electrical Power 263\n\n\n\nZs (Fig. 10.17). The two source parameters are determined\nas follows\n\u2022 With open circuit between load points 1 and 2 as in\n\nFig. 10.17b, but with all other parameters at rated values,\nthe voltage between terminals 1 and 2 equals the source\nvoltage Vs (since the internal voltage drop is zero under\nzero load current). Therefore, Vs is the open circuit\nvoltage of the system at the load terminals.\n\n\u2022 With the terminals 1 and 2 shorted, the internal voltage is\nnow totally consumed in driving the current through the\nsource impedance only. Therefore, Zs is the open circuit\nvoltage/short circuit current at the load terminals.\nThe short circuit current can be determined by calcula-\n\ntions, or by tests at a reduced voltage applied to limit the\ncurrent to the rated value. The full short circuit current is\nthen calculated by scaling to full rated voltage. Any non-\nlinearity, if present, must be accounted for. The source\nimpedance of most spacecraft bus architectures is highly\nnon-linear due to use of multiple bus regulators along with\ndead-band regions. The dynamic performance of such sys-\ntems is largely driven by the transient nature of switching\nfrom one mode to another, such as solar array shunt control\nto battery discharge control. Linear modeling may be\nacceptable for steady-state regulation and small signal load\nchanges within the control range of each controller, but not\n\nfor modeling mode change transition, which must use a\ntransient model for the individual control.\n\nThe Thevenin equivalent source model derived under the\nsteady-state static condition gives the static bus impedance\nZs. The source impedance derived under the dynamic con-\ndition (that is for an alternating or incremental load) is the\ndynamic bus impedance Zd. This varies with frequency and\ncan be either calculated or measured by test. With the bus in\noperational mode delivering its rated load, a small high\nfrequency AC current Ih is injected into the bus using an\nindependent current source, and the value of Vh, the high\nfrequency voltage perturbation in the bus voltage, is mea-\nsured. The dynamic bus impedance at that frequency is then\nZd = (Vh/Ih). Since Zd has a strong influence on the sys-\ntem\u2019s dynamic performance, it is kept below specified\nlimits. Figure 10.18 is a typical main bus source impedance\nfor a mid-size GEO communications satellite.\n\n10.3.1.3 Stability Criteria\nThe steady-state stable operating point is where a PV panel\u2019s\npower output equals the load power. The constant power\nload has two such points, A1 and A2 shown in Fig. 10.6. If\npoint A1 gets a small disturbance of +DV for any reason,\nthere would be a positive power excess, moving the voltage\nhigher from A1, and again further higher in a runaway\n\n1\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(a) (b)Fig. 10.17 Thevenin equivalent\nsource model of complex\nelectrical network. a Complex\nelectrical network. b Thevenin\nequivalent source\n\nTypical 5-10 kW 100-V  \nfully regulated bus \n\nTypical 1-2 kW 28-V sun-\nregulated bus \n\n10.0 \n\n0.10 \n\n1000 10k \n\n1.00 \n\n 0.01 \n100 100k 1M \n\nIm\npe\n\nda\nnc\n\ne \nat\n\n p\now\n\ner\n r\n\neg\nul\n\nat\nor\n\n te\nrm\n\nin\nal\n\ns \n(\n\nFrequency (Hz) \n 10  10M \n\n0.25 \n\n5.00 \n\n  0.05 \n\nFig. 10.18 Main bus source\nimpedance for a 28 and 100 V\nGEO communications satellite\n\n264 M.

On the other hand, at point A2, a small voltage\ndisturbance of +DV due to any reason would result in a\npower deficit, restoring the system back to its original\noperating point A2. Thus, point A2 is a stable operating point,\nwhere the system works like a negative feedback system.\nAnalytically, an operating point is stable if and only if\n\ndV\ndI\n\n? ?\n\nsource\n\n\\\ndV\ndI\n\n? ?\n\nload\n\n: \u00f010:9\u00de\n\nIn terms of the absolute values of the dynamic imped-\nances, Zs is the source output impedance and ZL is the load\ninput impedance, the system is stable only if Zs\\ZL at all\nfrequencies. When Zs [ ZL, the system is not necessarily\nunstable and requires further analysis to determine the sta-\nbility. The constant power load gives a stable operating\npoint only on the right-hand side of the Pmax point. The\nsolar array powering a purely resistive load is always stable,\nsince Eq. 10.9 is always true.\n\n10.3.2 Electromagnetic Interference,\nCompatibility and Electrostatic\nDischarge\n\nAll spacecraft systems are required to be compatible with\nthe interference expected from internal and external sour-\nces. For decades, the electromagnetic interference (EMI)\nand electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements\nhave come from MIL-STD-461. It specified the maximum\nemission limit of the potential culprit, and the minimum\nsusceptibility level of the potential victim equipment. The\ncompanion MIL-STD-462 defined the test methods for\nverifying that MIL-STD-461 requirements were met, and\nMIL-STD-463 defined the applicable terms and units. The\nfirst two standards are now merged into one, MIL-STD-461.\nThe contractor of commercial and defense spacecraft is\nrequired to develop three documents and submit to the\ncustomer as deliverables: (1) EMC control plan, (2) EMI\ntest plan, and (3) EMI test report.\n\n10.3.2.1 EMI Sources and Suppression\nThe EMI requirements broadly fall in two general groups,\nthe conducted EMI and the radiated EMI. In fact, EMI can\nenter the equipment either by conduction via wires, or by\nradiation in space. In verifying that a spacecraft will meet\nthese requirements, the first order of task is to determine the\nconducted EMI and the radiated EMI from potential sour-\nces, and the degree of coupling to the victim equipment. In\nspace systems, the main sources of EMI are (1) switching\nlarge current or voltage at high frequency causing large\n\u00f0dI=dt\u00de and \u00f0dV=dt\u00de, (2) electrostatic discharge, and\n(3) nuclear detonation around the spacecraft. Various\n\nmethods of controlling and/or suppressing the EMI in the\nspacecraft are, in the order of their importance\n\u2022 Minimize the EMI generation in the first place by\n\u2022 Minimizing the current loop area in switching circuits\n\u2022 Minimizing the switching transient\u2019s \u00f0dI=dt\u00de rate in large\n\ncurrent loops\n\u2022 Using snubber capacitors to minimize the voltage tran-\n\nsient\u2019s \u00f0dV=dt\u00de rate\n\u2022 Minimize the E and B field couplings between the culprit\n\nand the victim equipment by\n\u2013 Minimizing the inductive coupling by twisting wires or\n\nusing coax cables\n\u2013 Minimizing the capacitive coupling by using shields\n\nand by reducing area of exposed metal and keeping it\nfar from the ground, since C \u00bc \u00f0kA=d\u00de:\n\n\u2022 Divert the energy impinging on the victim equipment to\nground by using\n\u2013 Proper grounding scheme\n\u2013 Faraday shield, single or double.\n\n\u2022 Protect the equipment from the coupled energy by using\n\u2013 L-C filters for conducted EMI.Enclosure shield for\n\nradiated EMI.\n\n10.3.2.2 Electrostatic Discharge\nAn electrostatic charge accumulates on any probe in space\nregardless of its being in or out of the van Allen belts. The\naccumulated charge raises the electrical potential of the\nprobe, causing a current flow from the probe to the sur-\nrounding plasma. If the current cannot maintain a balance of\ncharge, the probe\u2019s potential will keep rising until arcing\ntakes place. This problem can occur particularly when the\nspacecraft leaves or enters an eclipse, when the interaction\nwith space suddenly changes. Arcing can also arise due to\ndifferential charging of insulated surfaces that are not elec-\ntrically connected. Each isolated surface acts as an inde-\npendent probe in space, which eventually floats to a potential\nthat results in no net current to or from the space plasma.\nThat potential is of the order of the plasma kinetic energy.\nInsulating surface do not distribute surface charge, hence\ncan charge up to much higher differential potential until\ndischarge takes place by way of arcing and/or flashover.\n\nThe charging, the subsequent electrostatic discharge\n(ESD), and their remediation in GEO and in LEO are sig-\nnificantly different. In the high-energy plasma environment\nof GEO, the electron charge that accumulates on insulating\nsurfaces increases the electric field to adjacent conductors\nabove the breakdown level, leading to arcing. The resultant\narcing currents traveling through conductors can upset\nelectronic components and induce spurious signals. A com-\nmon design solution for GEO is to coat all outside surfaces\nof the spacecraft with conducting materials. This prevents\ndifferential charging by distributing the charge over all\n\n10 Electrical Power 265\n\n\n\nsurfaces and equalizing their potentials. A coating material\nhaving surface sheet resistivity of less than 5 kX/sq1 is\nconsidered adequate to eliminate differential charging. On\nsolar arrays, indium oxide type conductive and transparent\ncoating is applied on the cover glass when required.\n\nIn LEO, because of the high thermal plasma current\ndensity, surfaces do not ordinarily collect much differential\ncharge. The major concern in LEO is the absolute charging\nof spacecraft surfaces with respect to the surrounding\nplasma. Normally, the collected plasma current bleeds off\nthe absolute potential rapidly.\n\n10.3.3 De-rating Parts for Reliability\n\nThe U.S. Military Handbook-217 (MIL-HDBK-217)\nestablishes the uniform method of predicting the reliability\nof military electrical and electronic parts, equipment, and\nsystems. It lists the base failure rates per million hours of\noperation for numerous parts under base electrical, thermal,\nand mechanical stresses. Any deviations from the specified\noperating conditions would alter the failure rate listed in the\nhandbook.\n\nThe failure rate of an electrical component depends\nprimarily on voltage and temperature. The electrical insu-\nlation at high temperature oxidizes, becomes brittle, and\nmay crack, leading to failure (short circuit). The oxidation is\na chemical degradation, and follows Arrhenius exponential\ngrowth. Data from a range of electrical equipment shows\nthat the failure rate doubles (or the life is shortened to one-\nhalf) for every 7\u201310 ?C rise in the operating temperature. In\nthe reverse, the life doubles for every 7\u201310 ?C reduction in\nthe operating temperature. Similar degradation (wear) takes\nplace above a certain voltage, although it is not as well\nunderstood as that for the temperature. The rise in failure\nrate at high stress level is not to be confused with the wear-\nout failure rate. It raises the flat part of the classical bathtub\ncurve for reliability. The failure rate is still constant per unit\ntime, although another constant at another operating stress\nlevel.\n\nDe-rating is the reduction of electrical, thermal, and\nmechanical stress levels applied to a part in order to\ndecrease the degradation rate and prolong the expected life.\nIt is routine practice to decrease the wear-out failure rates in\n\nmilitary and space worthy designs. The de-rating in current\nis often done to lower the temperature. On the other hand,\nthe current de-rating in some active devices, such as tran-\nsistors, is done to control the \u00f0dI=dt\u00de rate, which can upset\nthe semiconductor operation; de-rating increases the margin\nof safety between the operating stress level and the actual\nfailure level of the part. It provides added protection from\nsystem anomalies unforeseen by the design engineer.\n\nMost space programs maintain their own preferred parts\nlist based on the failure rates. This preferred parts list also\ngives de-rating factors, which must be applied to all designs\non those programs. Both the selections of parts and the de-\nrating factors in the preferred parts list are based on the\nheritage designs successfully flown. Space agencies, such as\nNASA and ESA, maintain their own preferred parts list. If a\ndesired component is not in the preferred parts list, it must\nbe qualified by rigorous testing under the same environment\nas those in the list.\n\n10.4 Special Power Systems\n\n10.4.1 Interplanetary Mission\n\nThe mission environment depends heavily on the space-\ncraft\u2019s distance from the Sun. For interplanetary missions\naway from the Earth\u2014either, closer to the Sun or farther\naway from the Sun\u2014the solar array, battery, and power\nelectronics designs differ significantly because of the sig-\nnificantly different environment encountered. The extreme\ntemperature on either side\u2014high or low\u2014has a large\nimpact on the performance. The solar flux at any distance in\ndeep space is given by I = (Iearth/R\n\n2), where Iearth is the\nsolar flux in the Earth\u2019s orbit, and R is the distance from the\nSun in astronomical units (au). This equation assumes the\nSun to be a point source, and may give some error at dis-\ntances less than a few solar radii. The solar array power\noutput varies linearly with the incident solar flux. Therefore,\nas the spacecraft moves away from the Sun, the power\ndecreases inversely with the distance squared. The PV array\ntemperature also decreases in the same ratio, which results\nin a higher PV conversion efficiency. The combined effect\nof the flux and the temperature changes is such that the\nphotovoltaic power generation varies not inversely with the\ndistance squared, but with Ra, where a is approximately 1.5.\nTable 10.7 lists planets in our solar system with their dis-\ntances from the Sun in au, and approximate power gener-\nation rate in their orbits, considering both the solar flux and\nthe temperature variations. See also Table 4.3.\n\nDue to the Sun\u2019s proximity, the electrical power system\nfor a Mercury mission must meet the harsh thermal and\nradiation environment. Haines [7] of the European Space\nAgency has reported the power system design for a Mercury\n\n1 Sheet Resistance is a special case of resistivity for a sheet of\nuniform thickness. The SI unit if resistivity is ohm ? meter (X ? m),\nwhich is more completely stated in units of X ? m2/m (X ? Area/\nLength). When divided by the sheet thickness, 1/m, the units are\nX ? (m2/m2) = X. The alternate, common unit is \u2018ohms per square\u2019\n(denoted \u2018X/sq\u2019), is dimensionally equal to an ohm and exclusively\nused for sheet resistance avoiding misinterpreted as bulk resistance of\n1 X. Note that a square sheet with sheet resistance 50 X/sq has an\nactual resistance of 50 X independent of the size of the square.\n\n266 M. R. Patel\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nsample return mission. It consists of three independent\npower systems for each phase of the mission. For example,\nthe 20 kW, 100 V high-power system shown in Fig. 10.19\nis used for electric propulsion, and is jettisoned just before\nthe orbit insertion. After that, the 500 W, 28 V system is\nused for the orbiter, and a smaller power system for the\nsurface landing, sample collection, and return phase of the\nmission.\n\n10.4.2 Near-Sun Mission\n\nThe PV power system design for near-Sun missions\nbetween Mercury and the Sun needs special considerations\ndue to the high temperature. The solar intensity increases to\n100 Suns at 0.1 au (21 Sun radii, 1 Sun radius equals\n0.00476 au), and to 2,500 Suns at 0.02 au (about 4 Sun\nradii). The PV cell loses power generation capability at such\ntemperature due to loss in the open circuit voltage. Various\noptions to limit the temperature to below 1,000 ?C include\nreliably guaranteed array tilting, adding mirrors on the\nsurface to decrease absorptivity and increase emissivity,\npartially silvered cover glass, and various louvers and\nshades to control the solar flux. Moreover, the PV cell\nhaving high band gap is needed. Figure 10.20 due to\nBrandhorst and Chen [8] shows effective power output as\nfunction of au distance and band gap of various PV cells\noperating below 1,000 ?C. At distance greater than 0.5 au,\nthe band gap has no significant effect on power generation.\nAt distance less than 0.5 au, the higher band gap PV cell\ngenerates more power up to 0.1 au. Closer than 0.1 au, the\nPV cell becomes useless. The curves assume that the cell\ntemperature is limited to 1,000 ?C in all cases.\n\nIt is apparent from Fig. 10.20 that the PV power system\nhas limitations in approaching the Sun at a close distance.\nAn alternative approach may be to use the thermo-photo-\nvoltaic (TPV) direct energy conversion. There are several\nadvantages, including easy coupling to a thermal source\noperating above 2,000 K. The feasibility of such an\n\napproach has been demonstrated under US Department of\nEnergy funding, but not fully developed.\n\nAnother alternative is to use a thermoelectric (TE) con-\nverter with the Sun as the heat source. Such a system is\nfeasible for solar probes requiring instrument power under a\nfew hundred watts. For example, NASA/JPL in 2003\ndesigned the Sun-TE power system for a flyby probe to\nJupiter and then towards the Sun to study coronal heating\nand the origin and acceleration of the solar wind. In the\npower system design reported by Choi [9], the probe\u2019s\ndistance from the Sun varies greatly, from 5.2 au near\nJupiter (gravity assist orbit) to less than 0.1 au (4 solar radii)\nnear the Sun. The corresponding solar flux varies over 5\norders of magnitude from 50 W/m2 to 4 9 106 W/m2. The\nspacecraft bus is shaded by the primary sunshield blocking\nthe Sun. The shield\u2019s outside temperature is estimated to be\n2,100 ?C at 4 solar radii. A high temperature multi-layer\nthermal blanket keeps the spacecraft components cool. The\nshield and the blanket are made of carbon\u2013carbon\ncomposite.\n\n10.4.3 Deep Space Mission\n\nDeep space and outer planetary missions cannot effectively\nuse photovoltaic power generation due to insufficient solar\nflux. For those missions, an on-board radioactive isotope is\noften used to generate electrical power. The radioisotope\nheat is directed at a TE junction, which generates electrical\npotential just as in a thermocouple. The power system for\nsuch missions, therefore, typically includes a radioisotope\nthermoelectric generator (RTG), power electronics, and a\nsmall battery located inside the spacecraft body. The RTG\nheat may be sufficient to protect the power system from cold\ntemperatures. If not, an additional isotope heat is needed to\nkeep the electronics at required temperature. For example,\nunheated interplanetary spacecraft launched to explore the\nrings of Saturn would experience an average temperature of\nabout -190 ?C, which is the temperature of liquid nitrogen.\nFor this reason, low temperature power electronic circuits\nhave potential of finding applications in deep space mis-\nsions. Such circuits designed and operated at low-temper-\nature may result in more efficient system layout than the\nroom temperature circuits. The advantages include reducing\nor eliminating the thermal shutters and the need for an\nisotope heat, which can cause overheating during launch.\nUnderstanding the performance of power electronics at\nextreme low temperatures is needed for this purpose. The\nfollowing is known about the operation of power electronic\ncomponents near the liquid nitrogen temperature.\n\nPerformance of certain semiconductor devices improves\nwith decreasing temperature down to liquid nitrogen\n\nTable 10.7 Solar flux and PV power generation in orbits of various\nplanets in our solar system (relative to those in the Earth\u2019s orbit)\n\nPlanet Distance\nfrom the\nSun (au)\n\nSolar flux\nrelative to\nEarth orbits\n\nPV power generation\naccounting for\ntemperature difference\n\nMercury 0.31\u20130.47 10.40\u20134.52 Severe loss of voltage\n\nVenus 0.72 1.93 1.63\n\nEarth 1.0 1.0 1.0\n\nMoon 1.0 1.0 1.0\n\nMars 1.66 0.36 0.59\n\nJupiter 5.20 0.037 0.084\n\nSaturn 10.08 0.0098 0.031\n\n10 Electrical Power 267\n\n\n\ntemperature. At low temperatures, majority carrier devices\ndemonstrate reduced leakage current and reduced latch-up\nsusceptibility. In addition, these devices show higher oper-\nating speed resulting from increased carrier mobility and\nsaturation velocity. An example is the power MOSFET,\nwhich has lower conduction loss at low temperatures due to\nthe reduction in drain-to-source resistance Rds(on) resulting\nfrom increased carrier mobility. NASA has tested other\ncomponents such as resistors, capacitors, and magnetics that\nare needed for various power converters at liquid nitrogen\noperating temperature. Many of them have been found suit-\nable for operating an unheated interplanetary spacecraft [10].\n\nThe battery can be a roadblock at very low temperatures.\nThe Li-ion battery offers a somewhat favorable combination\nof energy and power density. However, its low temperature\nperformance below -40 ?C is poor. Tests have shown the\nfollowing about the Li-ion cells [11, 12]\n\u2022 Between room temperature and -20 ?C, variations in\n\nelectrolyte resistance and the anode to electrolyte\n\nresistance are negligible, but the cathode electrolyte\ninterface resistance increases substantially.\n\n\u2022 The cell voltage and Ah capacity fall to approximately\none-half at -40 ?C. As a result, practically no energy was\ndelivered at -40 ?C. This is due to substantial increase in\nthe total internal resistance.\n\n\u2022 Poor cell performance at low temperatures can be\nattributed to the electrolyte becoming viscous or solid\n[13]. It is also attributed to the poor lithium diffusivity in\nthe electrolyte. Work is underway to improve the low\ntemperature performance of the Li-ion cell.\n\n10.4.4 Radioisotope Thermoelectric\nGenerator\n\nAn RTG for power levels of several hundred watts has been\nfully developed and used for decades. Such a power source\nhas the advantage of supplying power all the times, thus\neliminating the need for a battery in a base load system\nhaving no peak power requirement. An obvious disadvan-\ntage is the heavy radiation shielding required around the\nelectronic components. The advantages of the RTG are\n\u2022 It provides power for a long period, independent of the\n\nspacecraft orientation and distance from the Sun.\n\u2022 It is suitable for missions far away from the Sun, too\n\nclose to the Sun, or lunar missions with long eclipse\nperiods.\n\n\u2022 The power output is not affected by radiation damage in\nthe Van Allen belts or from man-made nuclear threats.\nThe RTG consists of numerous thermoelectric cells\n\nconnected in series\u2013parallel combination to obtain the\nrequired voltage and current. Each TE cell converts the\nisotope thermal energy into electrical energy. The power\nconversion efficiency of the RTG depends on the material\nproperties and the hot and cold junction temperatures Thot\n\nLCL\n\nEP-PDU\n\nto Electric\n\nSwitched Power\n\nMain Array\nRegulator\n(7 out of 8\nredundant)\n\nMain Array\nRegulator\n(7 out of 8\nredundant)\n\nMPPT-2\n1 out of 2\n\ncold\n\nredundant\n\nMPPT-1\n1 out of 2\n\ncold\nredundant\n\nVoltage\nControl\n\n(2 out of 3\nredundant)\n\nSolar Array 1\n\n2 out of 3\nredundant\n\n+ 28 Volt\nPower Bus\n\nLCL\n\nLCL\n\nPropulsion\n\nModules\n\n(power\ncapability\n\nof 15 kW)\n\n(power\ncapability\nof 700 W)\n\n(power\ncapability\nof 9. 5 kW\n\n@ 1au)\n\nSolar Array 2\n\n(power\ncapability\nof 9. 5 kW\n\n@ 1au)\n\nReturns\n\nPCU Structure\n\nLCL\n\nJH  18-03- 99\n\nEclipse Power from\nMercury Orbiter\n\nLCL\n\nReturns\n\nMB\nCapacitor\n\nLCL\n\nLCL\n\nPYRO\nMODULE\n\nS/S-PDU\n\nPOWER CONTROL UNIT (PCU)\n\nSwitched Power\n\nPyro Circuits\n\n28 Volt Bus\nRegulator\n(2 out of 3\nredundant)\n\n+ 100 Volt\nPower Bus\n\nVoltage\nControl\n\n28 Volt I/F\nConverter\n(2 out of 3\nredundant)\n\nFig. 10.19 Main bus power\nsystem architecture for electric\npropulsion to Mercury.

The theoretical limit on this efficiency is Carnot\ncycle efficiency, gcarnot = [(Thot - Tcold)/Thot], where the\ntemperatures are on the absolute Kelvin temperature scale.\nPractical designs yield about one-half the theoretical max-\nimum efficiency. The most widely used material (Pluto-\nnium-238, 238Pu isotope with SiGe TE cells) gives about\n7 % conversion efficiency. Removing the remaining 93 %\nof the system energy as waste heat poses a significant\ndesign challenge. The specific electrical power output of\nRTG is typically low. Based on the total power system\nmass, it was 5 W/kg in the Galileo spacecraft. The 238Pu\nisotope is also scarce and expensive, a few million dollars\nper kilogram. The US did not produce it for some time,\ninstead purchasing it from Russia, with the US Department\nof Energy inventory of 238Pu dropping below 10 kg, how-\never US production of 238Pu recommenced in 2013/14.\n\n10.4.4.1 Thermoelectric Basics\nThe working principle of a TE converter is based on the\nSeebeck effect, which generates electrical potential when\nany two dissimilar materials are maintained at different\ntemperatures. It involves electron or hole transfer between\ntwo dissimilar materials under thermal energy. The two\nmaterials can be conductors or semiconductors. The TE\ncells for space power applications use semiconducting\nmaterials, one p-type and the other n-type, as shown in\nFig. 10.21. If two such dissimilar materials are held at a\ntemperature difference DT \u00bc \u00f0Thot ? Tcold\u00de, an electric\npotential difference V12 is produced at their junction. It is\ngiven by V12 \u00bc \u00f0a12DT\u00de, where a12 is known as the Seebeck\n\ncoefficient of the couple, generally expressed in lV/?C. The\ncoefficient a12 is often called the TE power, although it is\nnot really a power. It is a characteristic constant, which\ndepends on the material properties. The a12 is considered\npositive if the Seebeck voltage polarity produces current in\nthe p-type material from high temperature to low\ntemperature.\n\nThe total voltage generated due to the Seebeck effect\nworks as an internal voltage source. With open circuit (zero\nload current), the external terminal voltage V is same as V12\ngenerated internally. This voltage is designated as the open\ncircuit voltage Voc. When electrical current is drawn by load\nresistances RL, there is an internal voltage drop. This is\nrepresented by an internal resistance Ri, which is approxi-\nmately constant at a given temperature. The external ter-\nminal voltage V therefore decreases linearly with increasing\nload current, i.e. V \u00bc \u00f0Voc ? IRi\u00de. With the external termi-\nnals shorted, the maximum current flows to the load. This\ncurrent is designated as Isc, which is given by Isc = (Voc/Ri).\nThese equations can be rearranged to write I \u00bc \u00f0Isc ? cV\u00de,\nwhere c = (Isc/Voc), the characteristic admittance of the\nRTG power source. The last equation in this paragraph\ngives the I\u2013V characteristic of the RTG. It is a falling\nstraight line from Isc at zero voltage to zero current at Voc as\nshown in Fig. 10.22a.\n\n10.4.4.2 Maximum Power Extraction\nThe power transferred from the RTG to the load at any\noperating voltage V and load current I is P \u00bc VI \u00bc\nV\u00f0Isc ? cV\u00de \u00bc \u00f0VIsc ? cV2\u00de.

This equation gives the corre-\nsponding operating voltage Vm = Isc/(2c), which is also 1/2\nVoc, and the current at that voltage is 1/2 Isc.

The power at zero voltage is obviously zero.\nIt is also zero at Voc since the current is zero there. In\nbetween, the power rises with the operating voltage, reaches\nthe maximum value Pmax, and then falls to 0 at Voc. The\nRTG conversion efficiency is maximum at the maximum\npower transfer point.\n\n10.4.4.3 Effect of Temperature and Aging\nThe I\u2013V line of the RTG shifts upward for a higher DT, and\ndownward for a lower DT, as shown in Fig. 10.23. The\namount of shift is a characteristic of the couple material.\nAging has a small effect on the RTG output, because the\nbasic heat source has a long half-life in decades. For this\nreason, the power generation degrades a little, about 1.5 %\nper year (Fig. 10.24). Most power degradation is due to\nslow precipitation of the phosphorous doping in the n-type\nleg of the thermocouple. The I\u2013V and P\u2013V curves shift\nuniformly with time and temperature such that the maxi-\nmum power point remains at the same voltage. This is a\nhappy coincidence for the design engineer. The conversion\nefficiency is a function of the contact resistance and the hot\nand cold-side temperatures.\n\n10.4.5 Dynamic System with Alternator\n\nSolar energy can be used in a system other than photovol-\ntaic. A dynamic energy conversion system is an example,\nwhere the Sun\u2019s energy is collected in the form of heat\nusing a concentrator. The heat in turn is used to produce\nsteam and drive a rotating turbo-generator or a reciprocating\nalternator to generate electrical power. Such a system was a\nprimary candidate for the space station design in the 1980s\nfor a power requirement of 300 kW. The system configu-\nration is shown in Fig. 10.25. A parabolic concentrator\nfocuses the Sun\u2019s heat on a receiver, which boils a fluid.\nThe fluid can be a suitable liquid metal, such as potassium\nchloride. High-pressure steam of liquid metal produced in\nthe receiver drives a turbine based on a Rankin cycle. The\nfluid can also be a gas, such as a mixture of helium or xenon\nhaving a molecular weight of around 40. The heated com-\npressed gas in this case drives a turbine working on a\nBrayton cycle. A gas-based system minimizes erosion and\nsloshing problems in transporting the liquid metal. In either\na liquid metal or a gas-based system, the high-pressure\nhigh-temperature fluid drives the turbine, which in turn\ndrives an electrical generator. Waste heat transferred to the\nliquid coolant is dissipated via radiator panels to space. The\nenergy conversion efficiency is much higher than the pho-\ntovoltaic system. This minimizes the deployed collector\narea and the aerodynamic drag of LEO.\n\nThe usable energy extracted during the thermodynamic\ncycle depends on the working temperatures. The maximum\nthermodynamic conversion efficiency that can be theoreti-\ncally achieved is Carnot cycle efficiency. Higher hot-side\nworking temperature and lower cold-side exhaust tempera-\nture results in higher efficiency of converting the captured\nsolar energy into electricity. The hot-side temperature\nhowever, is limited by properties of the working medium.\nThe cold-side temperature is largely determined by the\ncooling method and the environment available to dissipate\nthe exhaust heat. An indirect but major advantage of this\nsystem is that the energy storage is interwoven in the system\nat no extra cost. It resides in the latent heat of phase change at\na high temperature of around 1,000 K. The system can store\nthermal energy for hours with no electrical performance\ndegradation, or longer with some degradation. This feature\nmakes this technology capable of meeting peak power\ndemands with no added mass or cost of separate energy\nstorage. It eliminates the battery requirement altogether.\n\nAlthough the solar dynamic technology is not yet proven\nin space, it offers potential advantages in efficiency, weight,\nscalability, and the overall cost in high-power spacecraft. The\ncost advantage comes from the elimination of costly semi-\nconductor PV cells. Such a system can be cost effective in a\n\n1.0 \n\n1.0 \n\nCurrent output (normalized)\n\nAt \n\nVoltage output (normalized) \n\nAt \n\nAt \n\nFig. 10.23 Thermoelectric current versus voltage and various tem-\nperature gradients\n\n270 M. R. Patel\n\n\n\nfew kilowatts to hundreds of kilowatts power range. The\nconcept is sufficiently developed for space use in the near\nfuture, particularly in high-power LEO missions. It may also\nfind applications in high-power defense spacecraft where\nlarge solar arrays can make the vehicle non-maneuverable and\nvulnerable to the detection and attack by enemy. It has been\nconsidered in the past for a 300 kW space station and for a\ndynamic isotopes power system (DIPS) for space defense.\n\nThe efficiency advantage in the dynamic system comes\nfrom the higher efficiency of the engine (25\u201340 %) as com-\npared to silicon solar cells (15\u201325 %), and higher efficiency of\nthermal energy storage of the receiver (85\u201390 %) as compared\nto the battery efficiency (70\u201375 %). The greatly improved\noverall system efficiency as compared to the PV system\ntranslates into less solar collection area. This results in reduced\ndrag and relaxed concern regarding station dynamics,\napproach corridors, and experiment viewing angles. The\nreduced drag is particularly important because it allows lower\n\nflight altitudes within given constraints of drag-makeup fuel\nand orbit decay time. At power levels near 100 kW, such as for\nspace-based radar, the PV solar array collector area becomes\nprohibitive. The solar dynamic power system is expected to\nfind advantageous applications in this power range.\n\nRecent prototype testing of a 2 kW non-optimized solar\ndynamic systems reported by Mason [14] demonstrated a\nconversion efficiency of 30 % using 1990s component tech-\nnologies. Significant improvements in efficiency can be real-\nized for large systems with ratings above 100 kW using newer\ntechnology components and optimized design parameters.\n\n10.4.6 Fuel Cell Power\n\nThe fuel cell was developed as an intermediate-term power\nsource for space applications. It was first flown on the\nGemini V crewed mission in 1965.

The fuel cell resembles a\nbattery in that it converts the chemical energy of a fuel\ndirectly into DC electricity. However, unlike a battery,\nit does not run down in energy and does not have to be\nrecharged. It keeps producing electricity as long as the fuel\nis supplied. The typical fuel gas is hydrogen or a hydrogen-\nrich mixture and an oxidant. One pound (450 g) of hydro-\ngen has 52,000 Btu or 15.24 kWh primary energy and\nrequires 8 pounds (\\3,600 kg) of oxygen to react.\n\nThe fuel cell finds applications in space missions lasting\nfor a few days to a few weeks where the battery is not\npractical. It also has a potential use as auxiliary power source\nfor orbit transfer vehicles. The regenerative fuel cell inte-\ngrated with an electrolyzer unit presents an attractive mass\nsaving for LEO satellites requiring large energy storage. It\nwas a candidate in place of the battery for the ISS.\n\nThe working of the fuel cell is the reverse of electrolysis.\nIn electrolysis, electricity is injected between two electrodes\nin water to produced hydrogen and oxygen. In the fuel cell,\nhydrogen and oxygen are combined to produce electricity\nand water. The energy conversion is direct from chemical-\nto-electrical. Since the process is isothermal, the conversion\nefficiency is not limited by Carnot efficiency. This is unlike\nchemical-to-thermal-to-mechanical-to-electrical energy\nconverters using steam or an internal combustion engine. It\nskips the usual combustion step of the conventional ther-\nmodynamic power system and converts a high percentage\nof the fuel\u2019s available free chemical energy directly into\nelectricity. The fuel cell efficiency, therefore, can be about\ntwice that of the thermodynamic converter. It is as high as\n65 % in some designs, and 75\u201380 % in solid metal oxide\nfuel cells developed for ground-base power plants. Its\nsuperior reliability with no moving parts is an additional\nbenefit over the thermodynamic power generators.\n\n10.4.6.1 Electrochemistry of Fuel Cell\nThe fuel cell consists of anode and cathode electrodes\nseparated by a liquid or solid electrolyte. The electrodes are\nelectrically connected through an external load circuit as\nshown in Fig. 10.26. Hydrogen or a hydrogen-rich mixture\nis fed to the anode. The hydrogen fuel is combined with\noxygen of the oxidant entering from the cathode port. The\nhydrogen, however, does not burn as in the internal com-\nbustion engine. It splits into hydrogen ions (H+) and elec-\ntrons (e-), and produces electricity by an electrochemical\nreaction. Water and heat are the byproducts of this reaction\nif the fuel is pure hydrogen. With natural gas (ethanol or\nmethanol) as the source of hydrogen\u2014as in some ground-\nbased fuel cells\u2014the byproducts include carbon dioxide\nand negligible traces of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons,\nand nitrogen oxides.\n\nThe hydrogen\u2013oxygen fuel cell consumes hydrogen as\nfuel, oxygen as oxidant, and an aqueous acid solution as\nelectrolyte. Their net reaction is 2H2 ? O2 = 2 H2O, and of\ncourse energy is released in the process. In one type of fuel\ncell, the electrons flow from the anode and travel through\nthe external circuit to the cathode, powering the electrical\nload connected to the terminal. The hydrogen ions migrate\nthrough the electrolyte to the cathode, closing the loop. At\nthe cathode, they combine with the oxygen and the\nincoming electrons from the external circuit to produce\nwater. The kind of ions and the direction in which they\nmigrate varies, depending on the type of electrolyte.\n\nThe fuel cell is thus a static electrochemical device that\ngenerates electricity by chemical reaction without altering\nthe electrodes or the electrolyte materials. This distinguishes\nthe fuel cell from the electrochemical battery. Unlike the\nconventional battery, the fuel cell has no electrical energy\nstorage capacity. Hence, it must continuously supply the\nreactant and withdraw the reaction products during operation.\n\n10.4.6.2 Fuel Cell Performance\nThe fuel cell works as a voltage source with an internal\nresistance. The electrical potential appears at the terminals\nof two electrodes involved in the process. The theoretical\nvalue of the fuel cell potential is 1.25 V, which matches that\nof NiCd and NiH2 batteries. Multiple fuel cells are stacked\nin series\u2013parallel combinations using heavy graphite pallets\nfor the required voltage and current, just as the electro-\nchemical cells are in a battery. However, as soon as the\ncurrent is drawn, the voltage drops significantly due to\nvarious losses. Because the primary loss mechanism is\nohmic loss in the electrodes, the voltage continues to drop\nwith increasing current. The voltage drop is given by\nVdrop = (a ? b ln J), where J is current density at the\n\n\u00bd O2H2\n\n+ _\n\nH2O Po\nro\n\nus\n a\n\nno\nde\n\n \n\nFuel Oxidant\n\nPo\nro\n\nus\n c\n\nat\nho\n\nde\n \n\nFig. 10.26 Fuel cell construction and operation\n\n272 M. R. Patel\n\n\n\nelectrode surface, and a and b are constants which depend\non temperature and the electrode surface.\n\nThe theoretical potential difference of 1.25 V between\nthe anode and cathode in the hydrogen\u2013oxygen fuel cell is\ndetermined by the difference of the free energy of the\nreaction product and the fuel and oxidant. This potential is\ndifferent in different fuel cells depending on the reactions\ninvolved. The electrical performance of a fuel cell is rep-\nresented by the electrode voltage versus surface current\ndensity, commonly known as the polarization curve or V\u2013I\ncurve. Ideally, a single H2\u2013O2 fuel cell could produce\n1.25 V DC at ambient conditions. Undesirable ions and\nproducts of the intermediate irreversible reactions decrease\nthe cell potential, even at open circuit. Further voltage drop\nunder load results from various irreversible polarizations in\nthe cell. The net result of these polarizations is that the\npractical fuel cell produces between 0.5 and 1.0 V DC at\ncurrents of 100\u2013400 mA/cm2 of cell area. Fuel cell per-\nformance can be increased by increasing the cell tempera-\nture and reactant partial pressure. A trade-off exists between\nachieving higher performance by operating at higher tem-\nperature or pressure and confronting the materials and\nhardware problems imposed at more severe conditions.\n\nThe practical operating range of the fuel cell is con-\ntrolled by ohmic loss. The V\u2013I characteristic in this region\nis very similar to that of a battery, except that the average\ndischarge voltage is lower. The voltage drops approxi-\nmately linearly with increasing current and also with time,\nas shown in Fig. 10.27 [16]. At any given time, the terminal\nV\u2013I relationship can be expressed as V \u00bc V0 ? kI, where V0\nis the open circuit voltage and k is a constant. The value of\nk increases and V0 decreases with time. The power at any\noperating point is given by P = VI = [(V0 - kI)(V0 - V)/\nk]. The maximum power is when dP=dt \u00bc 0, which occurs\nat V \u00bc 1=2V0, leading to\n\nPmax \u00bc\nV20\n4k\n: \u00f010:11\u00de\n\nUnlike the PV cell, the fuel cell does not work in use the\ninput energy or lose it mode. It uses the on-board fuel to\ngenerate power. For this reason, the fuel cell is not operated\nat Pmax until it approaches the end of life. It is rather\noperated at the maximum fuel efficiency until the EOL.\n\nAs V0 degrades with time, so does Pmax. The open circuit\nvoltage can be expressed as a function of time as\nV0\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc V0\u00f00\u00de ? K0h, where h is the hours since the fuel\ncell was placed in operation. With a voltage regulating\nconverter between the fuel cell and the load, the life of the\nfuel cell can be defined as the time it takes for the voltage to\ndecay below the required input voltage, for Pmax to fall\nbelow the required output power. It can be predicted from\nthe V0 versus time relation. The expected life of the fuel cell\nis determined as shown in Fig. 10.28 [16].\n\nThe performance of various types of fuel cell for space\napplications is compared in Table 10.8. Compared to a PV\narray, the fuel cell gives much higher power per kilogram.\nFlexibility is another major advantage, as it does not need\nSun pointing and provides the same power during both day\nand night. Its disadvantage is that it needs to carry fuel\non-board.\n\n10.4.7 Beam Power Satellite\n\nThe traditional power system in space uses a solar array and\na battery for each satellite.

In this concept,\ndepicted in Fig. 10.29, a high-power satellite generates bulk\npower, which is then transmitted to multiple satellites by\nlaser or microwave beams. The electric propulsion of a\nspacecraft using beam power from a powersat is also pos-\nsible. The beam power can also be used for rescue operation\nin remote regions of Earth, or anywhere in the ocean. The\nadvantages of a central power satellite transmitting beam\npower to a number of user spacecraft are\n\u2022 Large PV arrays are replaced by a much smaller power-\n\nreceiving antenna in the user spacecraft.\n\u2022 A significantly smaller battery can replace larger batteries\n\nas proper orientation with the power satellite(s) will avoid\nsatellite-to-satellite eclipses.\n\n\u2022 Longer mission life since the spacecraft life is not limited\nby its solar array or battery.\n\n\u2022 Provides large peak power if and when needed, such as\nfor electric propulsion, thus significantly decreasing the\non-board fuel mass.\n\n\u2022 Orienting the spacecraft to the powersat beam is much\nsimpler than to orienting to the Sun.\n\n10.4.7.1 Microwave Beam\nThe power transmission efficiency in space by a microwave\nbeam is given by Lineberry and Chapman [17]\n\ng \u00bc 1? e?\nAtAr\nd2k2 \u00f010:12\u00de\n\nwhere, g is the fraction of the transmitted power captured by\nthe receiving antenna, At, Ar is the transmitter and receiver\nantenna area, respectively, d is the distance between the\ntransmitter and receiver, and k is the wavelength of the\nmicrowave power beam. The distance between the powersat\nand the user satellite may vary. The microwave transmis-\nsion may be effectively used over short distances.\n\nThe frequencies considered for such systems are from 3 to\n300 GHz [18] with the corresponding wavelengths from\n100 down to 1 mm.\n\nIn 2003, an experiment was planned using the Cosmos-1\nsolar sail, at 800 km altitude, to transmit power by a micro-\nwave beam from the Goldstone 100 m antenna. The Gold-\nstone steerable dish radiates up to 1/2 MW power; it was\nestimated the sail would to receive only 1,700 W. The\nresulting microwave pressure was estimated to accelerate the\nsail by 10-7 g and demonstrate the principle of beaming\npower to a spacecraft. The acceleration of the sail would have\ndepended only on power and not on the frequency of the\nbeam, however the experiment was not conducted due a\nfailure of the Cosmos-1 launch vehicle. In another experiment\nat JPL and the University of California at Irvine, a 10 kW, 7-\nGHz microwave beam in vacuum chamber produced a power\ndensity of 1 kW/cm2 to heat a sail surface to 2,000 K.\n\nMicrowave transmitters have been under developments\nmuch longer than lasers. They are far more efficient and\ncost much less. They do not damage the receiving surface as\nlasers can, and do not refract while passing through air.\nHowever, microwaves require much larger antennas for the\nsame focusing ability.\n\n10.4.7.2 Laser Beam\nLaser beams may be more efficient over long distances in\nthe 10,000\u201350,000 km range [19]. The laser system consist\nof three parts\n\u2022 First the solar energy collected on the powersat is con-\n\nverted into laser beam using a solid-state solar pumped\nlaser. It consists of a crystal placed in the focus of a\nparabolic solar concentrator.\n\n\u2022 The monochromatic laser radiation is then focused into a\nbeam using an optical mirror of appropriate size. The\nwavelength of such a laser is equal to 1.06 lm, and the\n\nMicrowave power beams \n\nOrbiting power \nsatellite \n\nLEO  \n\nSite on land  \n\nShip in ocean  \n\nMEO   \n\nTo Mars \n\nGEO   \n\nFig. 10.29 Power transmission\nfrom central power satellite to\nmultiple satellites\n\n274 M. R. Patel\n\n\n\nconversion efficiency 20\u201325 %. A focused power laser\nbeam then transmits the power to the user satellite or a\nrescue site on the Earth at 80\u201390 % efficiency.\n\n\u2022 Finally, the received energy is converted into electrical\npower using the conventional PV cell. The conversion\nefficiency of a PV cell under laser illumination is around\n50 %. The maximum electrical power output of the sili-\ncon PV cell using such a system can be 3,000 W/m2 from\nlaser radiation compared to 300 W/m2 from natural solar\nradiation. The solar array requirement on the user satellite\nis thus greatly reduced, and the battery can be eliminated\nby avoiding powersat-to-user satellite eclipses.\nA powersat, once developed and built, could make the\n\nuser satellite much lighter and less expensive, so that many\ncould be launched at lower cost per launch. This could open\nup entirely new kinds of missions in Earth orbit and in\ninterplanetary space at much less incremental cost. The\nconcept is like the 19th century railroad system. Once the\ntracks are laid, the train itself is a small added expense.\n\n10.4.7.3 Space-to-Ground Power\nDriven by the environmental and depletion concerns of the\nfossil energy sources, the U.S. Department of Energy,\nNASA and ESA have funded space-based generation of\npower for ground use. The equivalent mass density of air on\nEarth with typical moisture and pollution is 1.5 times that of\npure air. The solar radiation on a normal Earth surface with\nair mass 1.5 (AM 1.5) is about 1 kW/m2. With 12-hour\nnights on average, seasonal Sun variations, and overcasts,\nthe annual average energy yield of a ground-based PV\nsystem may be around 6 kWh/m2 per day. A 400 MW\npower station on the ground using 20 % efficient PV cells\nwould need 40 million square meters of PV array. Storing\nsufficient energy to last 5 days without Sun would require\n60,000 MWh of energy storage assuming 80 % round trip\nenergy efficiency. A space-based system can reduce the\ncollector area to 1/4th and eliminate the need of energy\nstorage by making the beam power dispatchable on demand.\n\nThe performance of a solar array placed on the Earth\u2019s\nsurface versus in LEO and GEO is summarized in\nTable 10.9. It shows that the energy collection per square\nmeter in space is several times higher than that on Earth.\nFurthermore, it is 50 % higher in GEO than in LEO. One\nconcept study has considered a medium Earth orbit at around\n10,000 km altitude for such a powersat for ground use.\n\nAmbitious proposals have been explored for harnessing\nsolar energy for terrestrial use by deploying solar powersats\nin GEO that could generate power 24 h a day, 365 days a\nyear. One concept study has shown that one satellite with a\n146 km2 solar array could deliver power equivalent to 10\nnuclear power plants on Earth. The 1 km2 antenna would\ntransmit power in a sharp 2.4 GHz microwave beam to an\nEarth receiving station. Here, it would be converted into DC\n\nand inverted into 10,000 MW 60 Hz AC and delivered to\nthe distribution system of the electrical power utility. The\nbasic converter would use inductors (perhaps supercon-\nducting) to store the energy and boost the voltage.\n\nIn the proposed concept, the beamed power is converted\nto 60 or 50 Hz utility power using high voltage converters.\nMassive series\u2013parallel connections of numerous converters\nwould be needed to beam gigawatts of power to Earth from\nspace [20]. The space-to-space power transmission would\nbe at low level in W/m2, while the space-to-ground power\ntransmission would be in hundreds of W/m2. However, a\nU.S. government regulation limits the microwave radiation\nto 110 W/m2. Therefore, the hundreds of W/m2 beam\nintensity would require a regulation change or special per-\nmission to beam to a remote location from where it would\nbe transmitted to populated load centers. This high beam\nintensity is still a several times lower than the natural Sun\nintensity of 1,000 W/m2 on the ground. Whether it would\npose a cancer risk to humans has yet to be resolved.\n\nSeveral innovative concepts are being studied for col-\nlecting solar energy in space and transmitting microwave\nbeams to other spacecraft that may be orbiting the Earth, on\nan interplanetary mission, or on a planetary surface.\nNASA\u2019s Solar Space Power Exploratory Research and\nTechnology program is investigating systems at power\nlevels ranging from 100 kW to 1,200 MW. The building\nblocks of such a system are\n\u2022 A large Sun-oriented solar array that tracks the Sun and\n\ngenerates power at high voltage in the 400\u20131,000 V\nrange.\n\n\u2022 A rotating microwave transmitter in space that tracks a\nreceiving antenna (rectenna)/rectifier station on Earth.\n\n\u2022 A microwave beam at several GHz frequency, using\nsolid-state power converters, magnetrons, or klystrons.\n\n\u2022 A rotary joint between the solar collector and the\ntransmitter.\n\nTable 10.9 Performance of solar array placed on ground and in LEO\nand GEO\n\nSolar array\nlocation\n\nEarth LEO GEO\n\nAir mass 1.5 with average\nmoisture and\npollution\n\n0 0\n\nSolar radiation\n(W/m2)\n\n1,000 in full Sun 500\nin partial Sun\n\n1,350 1,350\n\nIncident energy\n(kWh/m2 per year)\n\n1,643 7,884 11,826\n\nUseful sunlight\n(h/day)\n\n6 on average 16 24\n\nLaunch and\nmaintenance cost\nin orbit\n\n0 Medium High\n\n10 Electrical Power 275\n\n\n\n\u2022 High voltage cables.\n\u2022 DC to microwave power converters in space and micro-\n\nwave to DC power converters and DC to 50 or 60 Hz AC\ninverters on the ground.\nA concept study for delivering 1,200 MW from GEO to\n\nthe ground grid has developed the following estimates [21]\n\u2022 A solar array with 4\u20135 concentration ratio with futuristic\n\nconversion efficiency of 39 % generating at specific\npower of 1,000 W/kg and 550 W/m2 at 1,000 V.\n\n\u2022 A 5.8 GHz microwave beam of Gaussian power density\ndistribution with 10 dB taper from the transmitter center\nto the edge.\n\n\u2022 Solid-state transmitters operating at 80 V and the solar\narray at 1,000 V.\n\n\u2022 Power distribution from solar array at 100 kV, so that\nconverters are needed at both ends of the distribution\nlines. These converters substantially add into the system\nmass. Using 6,000 V magnetrons and reducing the dis-\ntribution voltage to 6,000 V could eliminate the trans-\nmission voltage converters.\n\n\u2022 A rectenna size on Earth about 7,450 m in diameter.\n\u2022 Overall wireless power transmitting efficiency around 35 %.\n\u2022 A system for 1,200 MW power to the grid requires a solar\n\narray of 7,300,000 m2 area, equating to a 2,700 9\n2,700 m2 or 3 km diameter array in space. The rectenna on\nthe ground is estimated to be 44,000,000 m2 area or\n7.5 km diameter. The ground receiver would be about six\ntimes the solar array area because of (a) power losses in\nvarious components, and (b) the beam power density being\nlimited under the federal regulation on microwave power.\n\n\u2022 The mass of the above concept satellite is estimated to be\n22,500\u201330,000 metric tons at launch and 17,000\u201322,000\nmetric tons in orbit. A great many technology develop-\nments and demonstration are needed to make the cost per\nkWh delivered to the ground competitive with the con-\nventional ground-based grid power [22\u201324].\n\nAcknowledgments Several figures and tables in this chapter are\nreproduced with permission from Patel, M.

When pushing out matter,\nthe inertia of the expelled mass produces an equal and\nopposite push or \u2018thrust\u2019 against the rest of the spacecraft\nand the spacecraft is accelerated.\n\nOn Earth, the push to accelerate a body may be against\nthe ground, as in walking, when the acceleration is the result\nof the pavement pushing against the shoe soles or foot and a\npush force is applied to the soil by friction. In swimming, or\nrowing, a force (pressure) is applied to water by using a\nsolid surface, oar or arm, and the resulting pressure accel-\nerates the oar or arm in return. In space, there is nothing to\npush \u2018against\u2019, and it is the action of ejecting mass from a\nspacecraft, that is, of imparting a momentum to the mass\nejected, that applies the exactly opposite reaction, resulting\nin a change of the momentum of the spacecraft. In general,\nthe mass ejected may be already in motion with respect to\nthe spacecraft, so the thrust force F is therefore described as\nthe difference between the momentum inside the engine of\nthe mass to be ejected, and that when leaving the spacecraft.\nThe scalar form of F is\n\nF \u00bc dm\ndt\n\nve \u00f011:1\u00de\n\nand is generally a function of time. In propulsion systems\nwhere the exhaust is obtained by a thermodynamic expansion\nand the mass is gaseous, there is an extra term Ae(pe - pa)\ncontributing to the total F, see Sect. 11.9, due to the fact that\nthere is a difference of pressure between the engine exit and\nthe ambient environment. In space, the ambient pressure is of\ncourse practically zero. The total impulse, Itot, corresponding\nto a thrust force F acting for a total time t, is defined as\n\nItot \u00bc\nZt\n\n0\n\nF t\u00f0 \u00dedt: \u00f011:2\u00de\n\nThe total impulse is a measure of the total change of\nmomentum available from a propulsion system, and is\nespecially important when the thrust changes over time.\nExamples are solid propellant rocket boosters, where the\nthrust is continuous but made to vary over time with a\nspecified law, and attitude control rockets that must deliver\nshort thrust pulses many hundreds of times.\n\nAs introduced in Chap. 4, the rate at which mass is ejected\nand its exhaust velocity, ve, determines the thrust and specific\nimpulse, Isp, which is the ratio of thrust to Earth-surface\nweight flow rate, _mg, where _m is the propellant mass flow rate\n\nIsp \u00bc F= _mg \u00bc ve=g: \u00f011:3\u00de\n\nNote that this equation is the same as Eq. 8.2, and was\nintroduced in Eq. 4.146. The units of Isp are seconds, where\nthe amount of propellant is measured as a weight, or force,\nsuch as kilogram-force or kiloponds.1 However, if the\namount of propellant is measured as a mass then specific\nimpulse has units of velocity. The conversion constant\nbetween the two versions of specific impulse is g, standard\ngravity defined as precisely 9:80665 m/s2.\n\nC.

In an ideal, one-dimen-\nsional acceleration process where no energy is wasted, the\nvelocity of the momentum and the specific impulse coin-\ncide. In a liquid rocket engine (LRE) ideal ve and gIsp\n\n? ?\ndo\n\nnot coincide as the gas expands only to the pressure at the\nnozzle exit, which is never zero, and hence some of the\nkinetic energy of the mass ejected does not do useful work\nand is instead wasted; the thermodynamic efficiency of the\nrocket engine cycle is never 100 %.\n\nUsing the specific impulse, and as introduced in Eq. 4.146,\nthe ideal rocket equation, also known as Tsiolkovsky\u2019s rocket\nequation, gives the change in mass of the spacecraft due to the\nexpelled mass for a given change in velocity, DV , as\n\nmf \u00bc m0 exp ?DV=gIsp\n? ?\n\n\u00f011:4\u00de\n\nwhere m0 is the initial mass of the spacecraft and mp is the\npropellant mass, such that the final mass is mf = (m0 - mp).\nFigure 11.1 shows the practical, rather than ideal, DV for\nmissions in the vicinity of the Earth and Mars.\n\nInefficiencies and perturbations such as finite burn losses,\nas discussed in Chap. 4, or thrust misalignments add to the\ntotal impulse and the ideal DV required to achieve a given\norbit, and thus add to the total mass consumption. Reaching\nlow Earth orbit (LEO) requires an ideal DV of about 8 km/s\n(9.3\u201310 km/s taking into account gravity losses and aero-\ndynamic drag), so to reach a reasonably high mass ratio,\nEq. 11.4 shows that specific impulse should be of the same\norder, because the higher the specific impulse the lower the\nmass consumption.\n\nUnfortunately, chemical energy propulsion is funda-\nmentally incapable of generating specific impulses higher\nthan 5,000\u20135,500 m/s, which means that simply to reach\n\nLEO the mass ratio of the payload will be low, even with\nmulti-stage rockets. Only propulsion systems with specific\nimpulses at least of the same order as the DV needed by the\nspecific mission can reduce mass consumption. Thus, short\nof inventing some sort of \u2018space drive\u2019, the price to pay to\naccelerate or decelerate a spacecraft (to acquire a positive or\nnegative DV) is the mass that must be ejected. This mass\nconsists of propellant(s) that must first be lifted to orbit at\ngreat expense, currently about seven to twenty thousand US\ndollars per kilogram, depending on the launch provider.\nOnce orbited, the propellant(s) mass must be accelerated by\na propulsion system using some force. The work done by\nthis force is ideally equal to the kinetic energy acquired by\nthe matter that is expelled. These considerations introduce\nthe next topic: What type of force is available in order to\napply Newton\u2019s third law to space propulsion?\n\nCurrent understanding of physics (\u2018the Standard Model\u2019)\nshows only three fundamental interactions (also called fun-\ndamental or interactive forces). In increasing order of mag-\nnitude, they are: gravitational; electro-weak (the result of the\nunification of electro-dynamic and weak force in the 1980s);\nand strong, or nuclear, interaction. The gravitational inter-\naction acts over (not \u2018at\u2019) large distances, and its associated\nparticle, the graviton, has been postulated but, so far, not\nfound; see also related discussion in Sect. 4.1.3. Its magni-\ntude becomes observable only with masses of the order of\nplanetary masses. The electro-weak interaction is responsible\nfor Coulomb and Lorentz forces, and thus holds together\natoms and molecules (\u2018chemical bonding\u2019) and a manifes-\ntation of its effect is combustion. Its magnitude is about\n1017 times that of gravitation. The nuclear interaction keeps\ntogether the nuclei of atoms, preventing their disintegration\ndue to Coulomb repulsion. It acts at nuclear distances, about\n1 fermi (10-14 m, which is, by no coincidence, the size of a\n\nEarth surface \n\nLEO \n\nGTO \n\n2.5 km/s \n\nGEO \n\n9.3 \u2013 10 km/s \n\n1.6 km/s \n\n3.8 km/s \n\nL5 1.7 km/s \n\n3.8 km/s \n\nEarth-like orbit \n\n0.7 km/s \n\nSun30 km/s \n\nMars transfer Mars-like orbit 0.6 km/s 0.9 km/s \n\nDeimos transfer orbit \n\n0.2 km/s \n\nDeimos 0.7 km/s \n\nPhobos transfer orbit \n\n0.3 km/s \n\nLow-Mars orbit \n\n0.9 km/s \n\nMars surface \n\n4.1 km/s \n\nPhobos 0.5 km/s \n\nLunar transfer0.7 km/s \n\n4.1 km/s \n\n0.7 km/s \n\nLunar surface\n\n1.6 km/s \n\nFig. 11.1 Minimum DV for\nNear-Earth and Mars missions\nwith Hohmann transfers; arrows\ndenote the possibility of using an\naerobraking maneuver.

Its magnitude is about 107 times that of Coulomb.\nTo each of the three forces is associated a potential. When the\npotential decreases, energy is released. Its effect varies with\nthe respective potentials, but is always in the form of kinetic\nenergy. The potential energy density (per unit mass) of the\nthree interaction is quantified in Table 11.1, in which\n\u2018metastable nuclei\u2019 are nuclei of isotopes where the spatial\nconfiguration of nucleons is not that corresponding to the\nminimum energy state, and thus is able to \u2018relax\u2019 to that\nminimum by yielding energy without fissioning. \u2018Annihila-\ntion\u2019 is the process whereby mass is completely converted\ninto energy following Einstein\u2019s famous E \u00bc mc2, that is,\na \u00bc 1.\n\nTable 11.1 shows that, per unit mass, the nuclear potential\nis the largest. The electro-weak potential is about 106\u2013\n107 times lower, and the gravitational about 1024 times\nlower. The gravitational potential can be exploited by flyby\nor gravity assist maneuvers, as discussed in Chap. 4. Such\nmaneuvers are becoming routine, and can save significant\npropellant mass. For instance, a Pluto mission may direct the\nspacecraft toward Venus, Mars, or the Earth itself, and the\nspacecraft will acquire kinetic energy at the expense of the\nplanetary gravitational potentials, and then \u2018swing by\u2019 with\nincreased speed. The Cassini probe left Earth orbit at close to\n12 km/s, and after repeated gravity assists, reached the\nJovian system at more than 50 km/s. These savings in pro-\npellants mass are at the cost of much longer trajectories and\ntravel time. Perhaps that is not critical in scientific missions,\nbut it becomes intolerable for crewed missions, where solar\nand galactic radiation doses to a human crew may be hun-\ndreds or thousands of times the standard dose in a year on\nEarth, which is a fraction of a milli-Sievert (mSv). It has been\nestimated that a crewed Mars mission lasting of the order of a\nyear will result in a dose to crew of order 1 Sv, with a sig-\nnificant probability of getting some form of cancer.\n\nPropulsion systems exploit one of these three forces, and\nthe vast majority exploit the second. Gravitation is too weak\nto become the driver of a space engine. The nuclear force\nwas exploited in the 1950s through to the 1970s to build\nnuclear thermal rockets, where the thermal energy produced\nin a nuclear reactor (NR) is used to heat a working fluid that\n\nis ejected to produce thrust, see Sect. 11.9. More recently,\nnuclear reactors have been proposed to power electric\nrocket engines (electric thrusters, or ET). Because of public\ndiffidence and fear, no nuclear-powered rocket or ET has\nbeen [officially] tested by the US since the early 1970s. The\nobvious advantages of nuclear power (NP) notwithstanding,\nspace propulsion has remained focused mostly on chemical\npropulsion (CP), where exothermic reactions produce hot\ngas that by expanding thermodynamically in a nozzle,\nconverts its potential energy (enthalpy) into kinetic energy.\nMore recently, there has been work on electric propulsion\n(EP), powered by solar panels. EP is based on direct\napplication of electrostatic (Coulomb) or electro-dynamic\n(Lorentz) forces to ionized chemical species or particles.\nElectrothermal operation (electrically heating and then\nexpanding propellant) is also used.\n\nThe performance of rockets/thrusters that do not operate\nbased on thermodynamic expansion\u2014for instance, all\nelectric thrusters, where an electric or magnetic field\naccelerates charged particles\u2014depends on the specifics of\nthe thruster. In thermodynamic thrusters the maximum Isp is\nlimited by the energy density available. With chemical\npropulsion the maximum practical Isp in vacuo is about\n4.5 km/s using the LOX/LH2 combination, equivalent to\nabout 465 s. Specific impulse could exceed 500 s by\nreplacing LOX with liquid fluorine (FLOX), but environ-\nmental considerations and logistics forbid its use. With EP,\nthe Isp is limited by technology because the Coulomb or\nLorentz forces that can be applied to ions are limited by\nvoltage breakdown and arcing, and by the intensity of the\nmagnetic field that can be produced by a magnet, roughly\n5 kV and 8\u201310 T, respectively. Thus, substantially higher\nspecific impulse is feasible with EP, but at the expense of\nincreasing thrust F, the jet power \u00bc 12 Fve \u00bc 12 FIsp. The term\n\u2018FIsp\u2019 scales with ve\n\n3 and grows very rapidly with increasing\nspecific impulse. At fixed electric power the product F times\nIsp is constant.\n\nSolid and liquid chemical propellant rocket engines (solid\nrocket engines are traditionally called solid rocket motors, or\nSRM) are the workhorse space propulsion systems. They are\nconceptually similar to those that power launchers to orbit,\n\nTable 11.1 Energy potentials of the three fundamental interactions, where a is the fraction of mass convertible to kinetic energy based on\nE = mc2\n\nInteraction Potential a Energy density, J (J/kg)\n\nGravity Gravitational 10-27 10-11 (two 1-kg masses at 1-m distance)\n\nElectro-weak Chemical (H2/O2 combustion) 1.5 9 10\n-10 1.4 9 107\n\nStrong Nuclear fission (235U) 9.1 9 10-4 8.2 9 1013\n\nFusion (D\u2013T) 3.8 9 10-3 3.4 9 1014\n\nMetastable (180mTa) 2.0 9 10-7 1.8 9 1010\n\nAnnihilation (p+ - p-) 1.0 9.0 9 1016\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 281\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nand materials excepted, their technology is still where it was\nat the dawn of the space age, between 50 and 60 years ago.\nImprovements have been in terms of materials and structures,\nand especially ubiquitous electronics. Specific impulse has\ninched upwards at the rate of maybe a fraction of a second per\nyear and is now topping at 454 s for space-operated LOX/\nLH2 liquid rocket engines, see Sect. 11.3, and at 260\u2013295 s\nfor solid rocket motors, see Sect. 11.2. Hybrid rockets, where\nthe oxidizer is typically a liquid like LOX or nitrous oxide,\nN2O, or hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, injected inside a hollow\nsolid fuel grain, have been proposed, developed and ground-\ntested, but even after many years of development are still not\nas efficient, and are used only for some sounding rockets.\nTheir future may brighten because of the high visibility\nacquired by application to the SpaceShipOne and Space-\nShipTwo suborbital vehicles. The specific impulse of hybrid\nengines is typically higher than that of solid propellants, but\nlower than liquid rocket engines. These engines are briefly\ndiscussed in Sect. 11.4.\n\nElectric propulsion is relatively new as an in-space\npropulsion technology, although its roots go back to the\nwork done by Ernst Stuhlinger (1913\u20132008) in Germany\nduring World War II (Stuhlinger was a member of the von\nBraun team). In most electric propulsion applications, the\nelectro-weak force, Coulomb or Lorentz, is applied directly,\nnot in the form of the rearrangement of chemical bonds. The\npropellant (Hg, Cs, Ar, Xe, H2, Li, et cetera) must first be\nionized, requiring between 3.89 and 15.5 eV of energy. In\nelectrostatic thrusters it is the Coulomb force that acceler-\nates ions, hence their name, ion thrusters, or gridded ion\nengine (GIE). This is the simplest type of EP. Alternatively,\nionized propellant may be injected in a magnetic and\nelectric field manipulated spatially so that it is the Lorentz\nforce that accelerates it. In some electric thrusters, part of\nthe thrust results from applying the Lorentz force, and part\nfrom the energetic collisions in the plasma driven by the\npresence of the electric field. Inelastic plasma collisions\nconvert kinetic energy into heat, and the resulting hot and\nneutral gas can be expanded as in a conventional nozzle.\nThis second family of electric thrusters includes magne-\ntoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters, see Sect. 11.8. The\nphysics of this technology is less advanced than that of\ngridded ion thrusters, mostly because the magnetohydro-\ndynamics (MHD) plasma is not well understood and\ninstability modes are a commonplace feature. Hall thrusters\ncan be looked upon as either downstream cathode MPD\ndevices or electrode-less electrostatic thrusters.\n\nSome electric thrusters do not require the creation of a\nplasma. This is the case for resistojets, where the propellant\nis heated by a resistor, for some ion thrusters that use cae-\nsium, where ionization occurs simply by contact with\nheated tungsten or colloidal fluids and the colloid droplets\n\nare charged electrostatically, and for field emission (FEEP)\nthrusters where ions are extracted from molten metal.\nHydrazine resistojets are used on many geostationary tele-\ncommunication satellites.\n\nThe ultimate propulsion system is based on the strong, or\nnuclear, interaction, and was the object of much research\nand development in the 1950s and 1960s, see Sect. 11.9. In\nthe same section, solar sails are also briefly described.\n\nThe subdivision of propulsion technologies based on\nfundamental physics (\u2018the Standard Model\u2019) does not cover\nexotic concepts such as zero-point energy, artificial space\ncurvature, or wormholes in spacetime. Some of these exotic\nproposals are grounded in current physics (general relativ-\nity), but are still immature as far as the method of exploiting\nthem for in-space propulsion. Some are built on suspect\nphysics [1].\n\n11.1.1 Performance\n\nThermodynamic rockets accelerate and eject a hot gas by\nthermodynamically expanding it in a nozzle, that is, a duct in\nwhich the cross-sectional area increases from the throat At to\nthe exit area Ae, see Sects. 11.2\u201311.4. Truly accurate perfor-\nmance prediction of thrust requires the solution of the reac-\ntive, multiphase, time-dependent, three-dimensional Navier\u2013\nStokes equations. However, for most (but not all) applica-\ntions, the flow is mainly one-dimensional, and the solution\nmay be approximated analytically if constant cp and cv are\nassumed, where cp is the specific heat at constant pressure and\ncv is the specific heat at constant volume, if the walls are\nadiabatic, and if the Reynolds number ?1. Viscous effects\nare then limited to the boundary layer close to the walls, and\nunder these assumptions may be, if necessary, calculated\nseparately from the one-dimensional flow. The simple one-\ndimensional approximation is not only computationally\nconvenient, it is also useful to single out key parameters and\nunderstand fundamental physics, see Sect. 11.2.\n\nFor propulsion systems that do not use the thermody-\nnamic expansion of a gas, for instance electric thrusters, the\nperformance depends on the force that accelerates charged\nparticles. This force, Coulomb or Lorentz, depends in turn\non the specific configuration of the electric or magnetic\nfields, either applied or self-produced by moving charges;\nthus, no simple general relationships for thrust and Isp holds\nfor electric thrusters. It is however useful to remember that\nusing energy arguments, the velocity due to electrostatic\nacceleration (the Isp) scales as the square root of twice the\npotential, and that due to the Lorentz force this scales with\nthe magnetic induction, B. In other words, the magnetic\npressure scales with B2. Thus, the performance of electric\nthrusters must be found on a case-by-case basis.\n\n282 C. Bruno\n\n\n\n11.2 Solid Propellant Rockets\n\nSolid propellant (SP) can be divided into two types: com-\nposites and double base. Composites combine separate fuel\nand oxidizer phases, both in solid form, inside a polymer\nthat is liquid in its original form, and solidifies during a\nthermochemical process called \u2018curing\u2019. This class of solid\npropellant is almost invariably used in boosters (\u2018solid\nboosters\u2019) supplying most of the thrust needed by space\nlaunchers and ballistic missiles at liftoff. A second class of\nsolid propellant consists of a solid solution of two energetic\nmaterials, each containing molecules consisting of O, C, H\nand N atoms. Their reaction is exothermic and forms hot\nCO2, H2O, NO, and N2 gases. The most important double\nbase solid propellant is the combination of nitrocellulose\n(which has good mechanical properties and is fuel atoms-\nrich) and nitroglycerin (the more energetic and O-rich base).\nAdditives invariably supplement both classes to improve\ntheir manufacturing, mechanical, thermal and combustion\nproperties, and their nature and processing are trade secrets.\n\nOnce ignited, the solid propellant releases combustion gas\nthat pressurizes the motor. The burning rate of propellant\nincreases and continues while the pressure stays above the\nminimum pressure for steady operation (the so called \u2018pres-\nsure deflagration limit\u2019, or PDL). Below that pressure the SP\nextinguishes. Thus, there is no way to stop or control solid\npropellant combustion once started, except by sudden\ndepressurization, for instance bursting the case open with a\ndetonating cord. This is one of the drawbacks of solid pro-\npellant propulsion. On the plus side, solid rocket motors are\nlogistically easier to operate and, for the same total impulse,\nare less costly than equivalent liquid rocket engines.\n\n11.2.1 Solid Rocket Motor; Main Features\n\nThis section focuses on composite solid propellant, the most\ncommon type for in-space propulsion. Rockets burning\nsolid propellant are also called solid rocket motors, and they\nconsist of a case to host the burning \u2018grain\u2019 (see Fig. 11.2)\nand withstand the internal combustion pressure and tem-\nperature, a nozzle to expand the combustion gases, and\nignition and thrust vectoring systems. The case may be\nmetallic (for example, steel segments as in the US Shuttle\nboosters) or be made of a resin in the form of a continuous\nfilament that is wound and cured until rigid (as in the P-80\nfirst stage of the European Vega launcher). Filament\nwinding is the more costly technology, requiring curing in a\ncontrolled atmosphere (inside an autoclave), but it results in\nstronger and lighter cases that enable a larger payload\nfraction. The parts of the case that have double curvature\nsurfaces (the top and bottom \u2018polar bosses\u2019) to seal the\ncylindrical case are typically, but not always, metallic, and\n\noften a titanium alloy. The solid propellant is cast as a\n\u2018grain\u2019, that may consist either of a single cast cylinder of\nsolid propellant, or several cylindrical segments, each\nmanufactured separately for engineering convenience and\npiled on top of each other prior to launch (this was the case\nof the Shuttle boosters, for instance). Grain combustion may\ntake place on the flat cylindrical base, as in a cigarette,\nwhere the burning surface regresses but its area does not\nchange over time. More commonly, however, the grain is\nhollow, with the hollowed volume being called the \u2018port\u2019,\nand combustion takes place on, and consumes, the exposed\nsurface of the propellant so that the area may change as\ncombustion progresses. The instantaneous shape and area of\nthe port determines the rate of gas production and thus the\ninstantaneous thrust. Multi-segment solid propellant grains\nare rarely used for in-space propulsion because the thrust\nand total impulse, Itot, requirements are much less than for\nlaunchers, and therefore these SRM are single-grain.\nCommon applications are orbit raising (LEO to GEO),\norbital changes and insertion into final orbits, maneuvering,\nand stage separation. More complex or repetitive maneuvers\nmay need real-time precise control of thrust and burn time,\nand so are performed by liquid rocket engines. It should be\nnoted that the use of SRM for in-space propulsion is\nreducing due to the generation of slag particles that can\ncause a debris risk to other spacecraft.\n\nCombustion in a SRM converts solid propellant into high\ntemperature gases. Ideally only the port surface burns. Any\naccidental cracks increase the burning surface and result in\nexcessive pressure and possible SRM destruction. Great care\nmust be taken in making sure that ignition and combustion\ntake place only on the exposed port surface, and this is\naccomplished by insulating or making inert all other surfaces\nthat might accidentally come into contact with hot burnt gas\n\nFig. 11.2 Cut-away view of a nominal SRM for in-space propulsion.\nThe burning surface shown is the internal surface of the cylindrical\ncavity (the engine \u2018port\u2019)\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 283\n\n\n\nand ignite. Sealing these surfaces with ablatives to prevent\nthem from igniting is a key manufacturing step. As in liquid\nrocket engines, SRM pressure is the result of the balance\nbetween mass flow of gases produced during combustion, a\nfunction of the burning rate that depends on pressure, and the\nmass flow of gases that the nozzle can eject, also a function of\npressure. During steady-state operation the two must be\nequal, and that fixes the nominal pressure in the port of a\nSRM, which can reach 90\u2013150 bars.\n\nA generic SRM for in-space propulsion is shown in\nFig. 11.2. The internal insulation (some type of rubber or\npolymer) shields the case from excessive temperatures and\ninhibits ignition. The nozzle is shaped as a simple conical\nbell and may be metallic or high performance resin, while\nits inner wall is ablative because no regenerative cooling is\npossible with solid propellant. This wall ablates endother-\nmically, and if its thermal conductivity is sufficiently low it\nwill keep the nozzle at an acceptable temperature. The\nigniter, or initiator, is a self-contained piece of hardware. It\ninjects hot gas, or hot sparks, formed and released either by\na miniature rocket or by a pyrophoric \u2018squib\u2019, into the\nengine port. Either one will ignite the surface at many\nplaces simultaneously. This is important to prevent asym-\nmetrical or dramatic thrust spikes during the transient and\nthe formation of uneven burning surface. For large SRM the\nignition system may be a chain of devices. The first (a\n\u2018squib\u2019) may be pyrophoric, and ignites the fuel in a bigger\nchamber containing more energetic material (here pellets of\nsolid propellant mixed with a very reactive metal, say\nboron). Combustion in this second chamber produces a\nflame jet that spreads combustion over the entire surface of\nthe grain port.\n\nNote in Fig. 11.2 the gimbal nozzle to control the\ndirection of the thrust and its actuator subsystem. Due to\ncombustion pressure (up to about 150 bars) the gimbal\nsystem must be gas-tight, on pain of catastrophic failure.\nThis is obtained by a complex system of flex-joints between\nthe bottom polar boss and the nozzle, one of the proprietary\ntechnologies in most SRM. Alternatively, the SRM may\nhave a fixed nozzle flanged to the polar boss, which is more\ntypical of orbit raising SRM.\n\nOnce the igniter starts the SRM burning, the grain sur-\nface starts to regress. Short of depressurizing the case by an\nexplosive device, thrust cannot be stopped, and is controlled\nonly by the change over time of the surface shape. Each\nmission requires a thrust profile, so the shape of the burning\nsurface must be precisely designed in advance. This is\nunlike liquid rocket engines in which valves regulate the\nflow of fuel and oxidizer and the thrust can be varied; in\nsome specialized types of liquid rocket engines from 10 to\n110 % of nominal, but 95\u2013110 % is far more common. The\nlack of real-time thrust control is perhaps the single greatest\ndisadvantage of SRM compared to liquid rocket engines.\n\nTheir advantage is the simplicity of operation, requiring no\ntanks to be filled. That is why all modern military ballistic\nand tactical missiles are powered by SRM.\n\n11.2.2 Solid Propellants\n\nIdeally, a solid propellant should have high energy per unit\nmass, produce gas of low molecular weight (MW), be dense,\nbe chemically and physically stable (e.g. with respect to\nchanges in temperature or humidity), be safe to handle and\nnot accidentally ignited by static electricity, impact, friction\nor high ambient temperature, be mechanically strong, once\ncured, and have low thermal expansion coefficient. It should\nbe easy to pour uncured in order to cast in a mold, and should\nnot produce excessive smoke when burning. Recently, low\nenvironmental impact has also become an important feature.\nIdeally, it should also be inexpensive. However, that is not\nthe case with solid propellant. The cost of the standard Ariane\n5 booster propellant (hydroxy-terminated poly-butadiene,\nHTPB 14\u201318, a composite with 18 % aluminum content and\n14 % binder) is between 50 and 75 \u20ac/kg, while the throat\ninserts, which are made of carbon\u2013carbon, cost from 1,000 to\n1,600 \u20ac/kg depending on the fiber structure. This cost is\nhigher than, say, the liquid hydrogen/oxygen mixture used\nfor the Ariane Vulcan or Shuttle main engines of about 3 \u20ac/\nkg (LH2 * 1 \u20ac/liter, LOX * 0.2 \u20ac/liter). Nevertheless, the\nSRM total cost is lower than that of a cryogenic stage, on a\ntotal impulse basis.\n\nAs previously stated, there are two families of solid\npropellant: double base and composites. Double base solid\npropellants are made by partially dissolving nitrocellulose\n(NC) a solid using nitroglycerine (NG), a liquid explosive\nthat is very sensitive to shocks. Both molecules contain C,\nN, H and O atoms in reasonable proportions, enabling\ncomplete combustion to CO2, NO, NO2 and H2O. After\ncareful mixing of the two, the resulting solution is solid and\nmuch less shock-prone. These solid propellants can be\nworked and shaped in many ways, but must be made opaque\nto light, and in particular to infrared light, in order to pre-\nvent accidental ignition by radiation transmitted from the\nburning surface to within the bulk volume. This is done by\nadding carbon black to the NC/NG solution. Historically,\ndouble base propellants were introduced a century ago as\n\u2018smokeless powder\u2019 to replace traditional black powder in\nall types of munitions, from handguns to large caliber guns.\nTheir cost is moderate, compared to that of composites. In\nspace applications only composites are used, as double base\npropellants have insufficient mechanically strength to\nenable them to be shaped as large \u2018grains\u2019.\n\nComposite solid propellants are a heterogeneous mix of\nan oxidizer and a fuel, in a matrix, or binder, that encases\nand supports them mechanically, plus additives to improve\n\n284 C. Bruno\n\n\n\nmechanical, thermal or performance characteristics. To\nobtain complete combustion, the stoichiometry of these\nheterogeneous components must be controlled during\nmanufacturing. Fuel and oxidizers are finely ground so they\nform a solid suspension in the liquid polymeric matrix to be\npoured in the die and then cured. Carboxyl-terminated po-\nlybutadyene (PB) and hydroxyl-terminated PB are the\npolymers of choice in current solid propellant applications.\nMost frequently, the oxidizers are perchlorates or nitrates,\ncontaining chlorine dioxide or nitrogen oxide groups. They\nare bound to ammonium ions (NH4), potassium (K) and\nSodium (Na) groups, respectively, forming oxidizing salts\nthat are commercially available. Ammonium perchlorate\n(AP) is the most common oxidizer, constituting 60\u201386 % of\nthe solid propellant. The size spectrum of the oxidizer is\nbroader than that of the fuel, and may go from 10 to\n400 lm. This facilitates the right \u2018packing\u2019 of the oxidizer\nand fuel, and ensures the correct stoichiometry. Currently\nused fuels are aluminum (Al) powders, with tailored size\ndistribution. Boron (B) zirconium (Zr) and magnesium\n(Mg) have been proposed or tested instead of Al. All metals\nproduce combustion temperatures in the 2,800\u20133,500 K\nrange, and their presence as a solid or liquid phase tend to\ndampen combustion instability. The concentration of alu-\nminum in composites is 5\u201320 %, with 16\u201318 % more\ncommon. The polymeric binder constitutes 12\u201315 % of the\ncomposite, and competes with the aluminum for the oxygen\nin the AP (ammonium perchlorate) or AN (ammonium\nnitrate) salt.\n\nAdditives \u2018cure\u2019 and bond the mixture during the casting\nprocess, while catalyzers reduce or increase the burning rate\nand plasticizers facilitate pouring and casting. A partial list\nof chemicals forming a composite solid propellant is given\nin Table 11.2. Catalysts increase or reduce the burning rate.\nSome do this in certain ranges of pressure, for instance\nproducing a nearly constant burning rate (thickness of solid\npropellant consumed per unit time, in mm/s or cm/s)\nbetween 30 and 60 bars (\u2018plateaunizing\u2019 catalysts).\n\nA high performance, high specific impulse composite\ncontains about 70 % AP, 20 % Al and 10 % binder. The\ndensities of these three phases are 1,950, 2,700 and 900 kg/m3,\nrespectively. The average density is about 1,800 kg/m3 for this\nAl-rich formulation.\n\nCombustion of aluminized AP-HTPB propellants forms\nliquid Al2O3, CO and CO2, H2O, HCl and other products in\nmuch smaller quantity; the alumina formed by burning Al is\nliquid at the combustion temperature in the SRM\n(2,900\u20133,200 K) but becomes solid at 2,300 K, eroding\nmechanically and depositing as a whitish coating in the\nnozzle. To maintain the nominal nozzle area (and thrust),\ncarbon\u2013carbon inserts that form a harder \u2018collar\u2019 are applied\nto the nozzle throat.\n\n11.2.3 Solid Rocket Motor; Internal Ballistics\nand Ideal Performance\n\nThe fundamental relationships of SRM operation are still\ndominated by semi-empiricism. It is theoretically conceiv-\nable to solve the multi-phase problem of a reacting solid\nmixture coupled with the reacting gases produced at the\ngas\u2013solid interface. In fact, most of the reactions that take\nplace in the solid, a heterogeneous mixture comprising\ndifferent-size particles of oxidizer salt and metal fuel inside\na solid polymer, in the presence of catalysts and additives,\nare unknown. Even if known, their interaction would have\nto be modeled at the scale of the finest particles, say 10\nmicrometers. As this approach is unfeasible, the funda-\nmental Vieille\u2019s law replaces actual unknown kinetics, as\nintroduced in Chap. 8, thus\n\nTable 11.2 A partial list of chemicals forming a composite solid\npropellant\n\nOxidizers AP, ammonium perchlorate\n\nAN, ammonium nitrate\n\nNP, nitronium (NO+) perchlorate\n\nKP, potassium perchlorate\n\nRDX, cyclo-tri-methylene tri-nitramine\n\nHMX, cyclo-tri-methylene tetra-nitramine\n\nMetal Fuels Al, Aluminum\n\nMg, Magnesium\n\nBe, Beryllium\n\nB, Boron\n\nZr, Zirconium\n\nMatrix/Binder CTPB, Carboxy-Terminated Poly-Butadyene,\n\nHTPB; hydroxy-terminated poly-butadiene\n\nPS, polysulfide\n\nPVC, polyvinyl-chloride\n\nPU, poly-urethane.\n\nCuring agents MAPO (tris (1-2-methyl) aziridinyl phosphine\noxide\n\nIPDI, iso-phorone di-isocianate\n\nBonding agents MAPO\n\nTEA, tri-ethanolamine\n\nPlasticizers DOA, di-octyl adipate\n\nIDP, iso-decyl pelargonate\n\nDOP, di-octyl phtalate\n\nBurn rate\ncatalysts\n\nFe2O3, Iron(III) oxide or ferric oxide\n\nFeO n(OH), Iron(III) oxide-hydroxide\n\nnBF, n-butyl ferrocene\n\nLiF, Lithium fluoride\n\nCuCr2O4, copper chromite\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 285\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_8\n\n\nr \u00bc a pc\u00f0 \u00den \u00f011:5\u00de\n\nwhere r is called the regression velocity, reported in cm/s or\nmm/s, and pc is the chamber operating pressure. Note that\nEq. 11.5 is a repetition of Eq. 8.40. The burning rate, or\nregression velocity, r, may vary between a few mm/s to more\nthan 40 mm/s for certain applications. The factor a, known as\nthe temperature coefficient, and the exponent n, sometimes\ncalled the pressure component or combustion index, must be\nexperimentally found as a function of temperature and solid\npropellant composition; for instance by testing at fixed\npressure in a test vessel a solid propellant cylinder (\u2018strand\u2019)\nburning only in the manner of a cigarette. The mass rate of\ngas produced by solid propellant burning is given by\n\n_m \u00bc Abrqp \u00f011:6\u00de\n\nwhere Ab is the area burning and qp is the solid propellant\naverage density prior to burning.

From this balance the steady state\npressure inside the port of the SRM can be found as\n\np \u00bc rpc? Ab=At\u00f0 \u00dea\nffi ?1= n?1\u00f0 \u00de\n\n: \u00f011:8\u00de\n\nThus, the exponent n must be\\1 for stable combustion;\nin practice it is between 0.3 and 0.5. Note also that (Ab/At) is\nan important dimensionless motor parameter with typical\nvalues much greater than 1 and is denoted K : (Ab/At).\n\nTo predict performance, the classic one-dimensional\nideal rocket relationships are used. These assume isentropic,\nnon-viscous expansion and a perfect or ideal gas. For an\nideal gas, enthalpy can be expressed using the specific heat\nat constant pressure, cp, and the absolute temperature; note\nthat formally the specific heat at constant pressure is actu-\nally the partial derivative of the enthalpy with respect to the\ntemperature at constant pressure. Assuming an adiabatic, no\nshaft-work process and the absence of shocks or friction\nsuch that the flow enthalpy change is zero, the total or\nstagnation enthalpy per unit mass, h0, is constant\n\nh0 \u00bc h\u00fe\nv2\n\n2J\n\u00bc constant \u00f011:9\u00de\n\nwhere J is the mechanical equivalent of heat, which is used\nonly when thermal units, such as the British thermal unit\n\n(Btu) or calorie, are mixed with mechanical units, such as\nthe joule (J).

The\nspecific heat capacity ratio is a constant for perfect gases\nover a wide range of temperatures. The term in square\nbrackets on the right-hand side of Eq. 11.10 is the ther-\nmodynamic efficiency, and R is the gas constant obtained\neither from the ratio between the universal gas constant, R\u2019,\nand the average molecular weight, MW, of the exhaust\ngases, or from the difference between the specific heat at\nconstant pressure and the specific heat at constant volume,\ni.e. R = cp - cv.

The major difference\nbetween the two is the molecular weight, MW, of the\nexhaust gas, which is higher for solid propellant than for\nmost of the liquid propellant combinations.\n\nCombustion of solid propellant is a feedback process\nsimilar to that which keeps a candle burning: the gas-phase\nflame pyrolyzes the solid fuel that releases the reactants that\nburn in the gas-phase. Once the solid propellant of a SRM\nignites, the ammonium perchlorate (AP) and aluminum\nreact exothermically and produce smaller hydrocarbon (HC)\nfragments that react with chlorine dioxide species in the\ngas-phase, raising temperature to 2,800\u20133,500 K. The hot\ngas feeds back heat to the surface that pyrolyzes and closes\nthe energy cycle. The propellant surface is at a much lower\ntemperature than the gas, about 800\u20131,100 K, while the gas\nflame may reach 3,500 K. High gas temperature coupled to\nthe gas velocity (that increases in the port going down-\nstream due to mass addition) may transfer too much heat to\nthe surface and cause so-called erosion (too rapid and\nirregular surface regression). Erosion causes excessive\npressure and thus a faster burning rate, r, and is one of the\ncauses of combustion instability. Instability means rough\ncombustion with pressure waves of large amplitude. In fact,\n\npressure spikes may reach twice the design pressure, with\ndamaging or destructive effects. More generally, all chem-\nical propulsion, not only solid propellant, is susceptible to\ninstability. The reason is that combustion is a complex set\nof phenomena, including vaporization, pyrolysis, diffusion,\nconvection, and chemical kinetics. Each of these has its own\nrange of characteristic times, and when two or more over-\nlap, coupling may occur, with one phenomenon in phase\nwith, and reinforcing, the other and vice versa. Thus,\ncombustion instability occurs also in liquid rocket engines\nand in hybrid rocket engines, see Sects. 11.3 and 11.4.\n\nAlthough Vieille\u2019s law is empirical and is an average\nderived from steady combustion measurements, for instance\nby strand burner tests, it is customary to apply it instanta-\nneously and at each point of a burning solid propellant\nsurface, especially in trying to predict dynamic or unstable\ncombustion. This permits calculation of the mass flow rate,\n_m, and then the specific impulse, Isp \u00bc F= _mg.\n\nThe shape of the burning surface Ab determines the F \u00bc\nF\u00f0t\u00de history and thus the trajectory and acceleration of the\nspacecraft. The initial shape changes with time, and to pro-\nduce a thrust F that is progressive, regressive, neutral, or a\ncombination (see Fig. 11.3), the burning area must be pre-\ncisely predicted using internal ballistics, implemented in\nproprietary codes. End burning, as in a cigarette, gives a\nneutral F, while a cylindrical port yields a progressive F. To\nhave a large Ab and a neutral curve the cross-section of the\nport must be tailored to remain almost constant in time. An\nexample is the \u2018dog bone\u2019 in Fig. 11.3; at the burn-end the\npressure decreases due to insufficient surface area burning,\nthe burning rate r drops, and the solid propellant extinguishes,\nleaving unburnt propellant \u2018slivers\u2019 stuck to the case walls. A\ntypical curve for the Ariane 5 booster is shown in Fig. 8.13.\n\nAn example SRM is given in Table 11.3, showing the\nkey features of the MAGE family of SRM used on the first\nthree series of the early Ariane launch vehicles.\n\nThe Zefiro family of SRMs developed for the Vega\nlauncher by AVIO are a more recent example. Zefiro Z9 is\nthe SRM powering Vega\u2019s third stage, and is detailed in\nTable 11.4. The solid propellant binder is carboxy-termi-\nnated polybutadyene (CTPB). The case is filament-winding\ncarbon-epoxy, with epoxy resin-based (EPDM) thermal\nprotection. The nozzle is carbon-phenolic with an ablative\ncarbon\u2013carbon throat insert.\n\n11.2.4 Solid Rocket Motor Manufacturing\n\nMost of the technology of solid rocket motors deals with\nmanufacturing. Unlike liquid rocket engines, SRMs using\ncomposite propellant are the result of many complex oper-\nations that need only to be summarized here. Starting with\naluminum, ammonium perchlorate (AP) and a pre-polymer\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 287\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_8\n\n\nin liquid form, the first operation is to mix it with AP and\naluminum powder. The rheological properties of the mix-\nture are the key to a homogeneous propellant that will\nproduce predictable and repeatable performance when\nburning. Once the case is fabricated, the thermal protection\nsystem (for instance, virgin rubber) is applied to the interior\nwall. The solid propellant mixture is then cast inside it and\nautoclave-cured at a specified temperature for hours or even\ndays, for large grains. After curing, the grain is separated\nfrom the mold, and milled to ensure port area and shape\nmatch specifications. Testing samples, qualifications and\nmany other operations follow that add to the cost of SRM.\n\n11.3 Liquid Propellant Rockets\n\nLiquid rocket engines (LRE) are propulsion systems that\nwork by mixing and/or reacting one or more liquid pro-\npellants inside a combustion chamber, and ejecting the high\n\npressure exhaust through a thermodynamic nozzle. The\nmomentum acquired by the exhaust gases produces the\nthrust, F.\n\nMonopropellant liquid rocket engines are typically used\nto control the attitude of a spacecraft, to maneuver (for\ninstance, to adjust and change orbit) and to deorbit. A\nmonopropellant reacts by decomposing exothermically, for\ninstance by passing through a catalytic bed. Examples of\nmonopropellants are hydrazine (N2H4), hydrogen peroxide\n(H2O2) or mono-methyl-hydrazine (MMH). The fuel is\nforced out of the tank using a stored inert gas, typically\nnitrogen or helium. If the gas is stored in a separate tank, the\nsystem is \u2018regulated\u2019 and the gas tank will be at\n3,000\u20138,000 psi, while the fuel tank may be at 200\u2013300 psi;\na regulated monopropellant system schematic is shown in\nFig. 11.4. If the gas is stored in the same tank as the fuel,\nthe system is \u2018blowdown\u2019 and the tank pressure will range\n\nTime \n\nT\nhr\n\nus\nt \n\nProgressive \n\nTime \n\nT\nhr\n\nus\nt Neutral \n\nTime \n\nT\nhr\n\nus\nt \n\nRegressive \n\nStar Time \n\nT\nhr\n\nus\nt Neutral \n\nMulti-Fin Time \n\nT\nhr\n\nus\nt \n\nDual Thrust \n\nDual Composition Time \n\nT\nhr\n\nus\nt \n\nTwo-Step \nThrust \n\nTubular \n\nRod and Tube \n\nDouble Anchor \n\nFig. 11.3 Predicted time evolution of a solid propellant grain burning\nsurface with a four \u2018dog bone\u2019 port cross-section (top), the initial shape\nof the port is in red; note slivers leftover at burn-end in tan color, and\nport cross-sections and their effect on the thrust history (bottom).\nImage Malcolm Macdonald\n\nTable 11.3 Main features of the MAGE SRM family; the first figure\nin the propellant name is the aluminum percentage, the second is that\nof the binder\n\nMAGE 1 MAGE1S MAGE2\n\nOverall length\n(mm)\n\n1,130 1,252 1,525\n\nOutside\ndiameter (mm)\n\n766 766 766\n\nExit cone\ndiameter (mm)\n\n480 520 633\n\nPropellant mass\n(kg)\n\n272 410 490\n\nPropellant CTPB 16-12 CTPB 16-12 CTPB 16-\n12\n\nOff-loading (kg) +63\n-22\n\n-82 -90\n\nMean\noperational\npressure, MEOP\n(MPa)\n\n4.075 4.4 5.02\n\nMaximum thrust\n(kN)\n\n28.2 33.5 46.2\n\nBurn time (s) 34 48.5 43\n\nExpansion area\nratio\n\n45.5 54 65\n\nSpecific\nImpulse, Isp,\nvacuum (s)\n\n284.7 291 294\n\nNozzle material Carbon\u2013\ncarbon and\ncarbon\u2013\nphenolic\n\nCarbon\u2013\ncarbon and\ncarbon\u2013\nphenolic\n\nCarbon\u2013\ncarbon\n\nCase material Filament\nwinding\nKevlar? 49\n\nFilament\nwinding\nKevlar? 49\n\nFilament\nwinding\nKevlar? 49\n\nOperating\ntemperature (?C)\n\n-10 to +40 -10 to +40 -10 to +40\n\n288 C.

Common bipropellants are liquid\noxygen/liquid hydrogen (LOX/LH2), LOX/hydrocarbons\n(HC), where HC may be kerosene or RP-1 (Rocket Pro-\npellant-1 or Refined Petroleum-1), liquid methane (LCH4),\nliquid propane (LC3H8), and hydrazine (N2H4) or mono- or\ndimethyl-hydrazine (MMH or UDMH, respectively) and\ndinitrogen tetraoxide (N2O4); typically referred to simply as\nnitrogen tetraoxide (NTO). Further, NTO is often used with\nthe addition of a small percentage of nitric oxide, which\ninhibits stress-corrosion cracking of titanium alloys; in this\nform, propellant-grade NTO is typically referred to as\nmixed oxides of nitrogen (MON) and is typically the more\ncommon form of NTO for spacecraft propulsion. By\nexample, a reaction control system may use NTO contain-\ning 3 % weight solutions nitric oxide (3 wt % NO), termed\nMON3. In the past nitric acid (HNO3) and other toxic\ncombinations were also used [2]. Recently, so-called\n\u2018green\u2019 combinations have been proposed and tested, such\nas LOX/ethanol and H2O2/kerosene. They are called green\nbecause they are neither toxic nor produce toxic products;\nhowever, LOX and H2O2 still need great care in handling.\n\nMaintaining chamber pressure can be done simply by\npressurizing the propellant tanks, or by using turbopumps for\nthe fuel and for the oxidizer. The power to drive the turbo-\npumps is obtained by pre-burning a small fraction of the\npropellants in a gas generator and expanding the hot products\nin a turbine. In most gas generators the mixture is rich, in\norder to avoid chemical attack by the oxidizer. A notable\n\nexception are the staged combustion, RD-170 and RD-180\n(PL-170/180, Parenysq Ldbuanekm-170/180, Rocket\nEngine-170/180), engines developed in Russia which burn\noxygen-rich in their gas generator; the RD-180 is shown in\nFig. 11.6 during a test firing. Typically, the turbine shaft\ndrives both turbopumps, but a gearbox has previously been\nused to drive two pumps at two different speeds. This can be\nrequired for cryogenic engines, as the mass flow rate of\noxidizer and its density are invariably much larger than that\nof the fuel. This difference can be such that the two different\nflow rates cannot be sufficiently realized by simply sizing the\ncentrifugal pump stages appropriately.\n\nCryogenic engines tend to use two separate turbopumps,\nwith each mixture ratio controlled by the respective turbine\nflow. The feeding pressure controls the mass that burns in\nthe combustion chamber at each instant, and thus the\nchamber pressure, pc. As the space vacuum pressure is close\nto zero, liquid rocket engines for use in space need a pc of\nonly a few tens of bars to achieve reasonable thermody-\nnamic efficiency. Figure 11.7 shows a schematic of a reg-\nulated bipropellant rocket engine.\n\nTurbopumps build enough head to circulate one of the\ntwo propellants in order to cool the engine. Generally, the\ncoolant is the fuel rather than the oxidizer, in order to\nprevent chemical attack; circulating propellant keeps the\nengine walls at approximately 600\u2013800 K, while combus-\ntion within the thrust chamber produces gases at tempera-\nture of order 2,500\u20133,500 K, which no material would\notherwise be able to withstand at typical operating pressures\n(50\u2013100 bars).\n\nFor low thrust engines, the tank pressure may be insuf-\nficient to achieve good circulation, because forcing pro-\npellant inside the jacket of a liquid rocket engine can result\nin a significant pressure drop. When the chamber and nozzle\nare cooled only by radiation it is often manufactured from a\nsingle piece of ceramic or refractory metal(s), for instance\nniobium or rhenium; see for instance Fig. 11.8.\n\nThe Aerojet engine in Fig. 11.8 has a radiatively-cooled\nchamber. The area ratio was 129, with a specific impulse of\n348 s, and thrust, F \u00bc 44:5 kN. This engine was designed for\nthe ascent from the lunar surface of the future Lunar Surface\nAccess Module. Figure 11.8 shows that actual expansion in\nthe test cell was less than that possible in vacuo.\n\nFuel and oxidizers are injected inside the combustion\nchamber through the so-called injector plate by means of\nseparate passages. These may be coaxial ducts, where the\ncentral pipe carries liquid oxidizer, and the annular duct\ncarries fuel. Non-cryogenic liquid propellants, for instance,\nhydrazine and NTO, are injected through angled orifices:\nthe high-speed jets impinge on each other, splash, form\ndroplets and burn upon coming into contact. Droplets\nvaporize much faster than jets, and combustion can initiate.\nHydrazine or MMH or UDMH and NTO are \u2018hypergolic\u2019\n\nTable 11.4 Zefiro Z9 key parameters\n\nParameter Value\n\nLength 3.7 m\n\nDiameter 1.9 m\n\nSolid propellant mass 10.5 metric tons\n\nCase mass 388 kg\n\nNozzle expansion ratio 60.8\n\nNozzle throat diameter 0.16 m\n\nAverage thrust, F 276 kN\n\nSpecific impulse, Isp, vacuum 294 s\n\nBurn time 106 s\n\nMaximum burn pressure 75 bar\n\nArea ratio 56\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 289\n\n\n\ncombinations, and as such they do not need ignition sys-\ntems. Most common propellant combinations such as LOX\nand LH2, or LOX/hydrocarbons (HC), are not hypergolic.\nDepending on the size (thrust) of the liquid rocket engine,\n\nthey need ignition devices that range from simple spark\nplugs to miniature rocket engines and torches. An overly\nlong ignition delay after startup (after starting injection)\nmeans accumulation of propellants in the chamber and\n\nHe T P \n\nNO NO\n\nL L \n\nF MMH\nT \n\nP \n\nF \n\nL NC\n\nL \nP \n\nT \n\nL \nP \n\nT \nL \n\nP \n\nT \n\nL \nP \n\nT \n\nL \nP \n\nT \n\nL \nP \n\nT \nL \n\nP \n\nT \n\nL \nP \n\nT \n\nService \nvalve \n\nPressure/Temperature \nSensor \n\nP T NO\n\nPyro valve, \nnormally \n\nopen/closed \n\nL \n\nLatch \nvalve \n\nBurst valve \n\nAccess port \n\nCheck valve, flow \nwith arrow \n\nGas \nregulator \n\nF \n\nFilter \n\nFig. 11.4 Schematic of a\nregulated monopropellant system\n\nService \nvalve \n\nPressure/Temperature \nSensor \n\nP T NO \n\nPyro valve, \nnormally \n\nopen/closed \n\nL \n\nLatch \nvalve Access port \n\nCheck valve, flow \nwith arrow \n\nF \n\nFilter \n\nHe \n \n\nMMH T \n\nP \n\nF \n\nL NC \n\nL \nP \n\nT \n\nL \nP \n\nT \nL \n\nP \n\nT \n\nL \nP \n\nT \n\nL \nP \n\nT \n\nL \nP \n\nT \nL \n\nP \n\nT \n\nL \nP \n\nT \n\nFill \nvalve \n\nFig. 11.5 Schematic of a\nblowdown monopropellant\nsystem\n\n290 C. Bruno\n\n\n\n\u2018hard starts\u2019, i.e. formation of pressure peaks that may\ndamage or even destroy the engine.\n\nTo operate in space, liquid rocket engines must be fed\npropellants irrespective of the direction of acceleration or\nspacecraft attitude. The mechanical design of each tank\nrequires the propellant collector to be always immersed in\nliquid, even in weightlessness, when acceleration is not\npresent, and even when the propellant is \u2018sloshing\u2019 due to a\nspacecraft maneuver, for instance, driven by auxiliary\n(attitude control) thrusters. If pressure-fed, the pressurizing\nstrategy is based either on a polymeric or metallic mem-\nbrane surface that is capable of staying flexible at the pro-\npellant temperature and of withstanding possible chemical\nattack, or on propellant acquisition by surface tension, for\nexample, with LOX/NTO. Polymeric membranes are\nmostly used with hydrazine for short- or medium-duration\noperation. The pressurizing gas (say, helium) compresses\nthe membrane on one side, which in turn pressurizes the\nliquid propellant on the other side. Bipropellants (NTO/\nMMH) use generally surface tension tanks.\n\nThe same feeding problem occurs in space operations\nwith liquid rocket engine turbopumps. In addition, due to\nthe minimal tank pressurization (2\u20135 bars) each pump must\nbe capable of \u2018sucking\u2019 the propellant flow demanded by\nthe engine during startup without cavitating (making bub-\nbles). As the oxidizer and fuel flows must optimize engine\nperformance, the turbopumps maintain the mixture ratio,\nMR, constant from startup to final burnout. This is espe-\ncially critical with low density, supercritical LH2; the\nsolution here consists of an \u2018impeller\u2019, shaped like a multi-\nblade outboard propeller with very coarse or helicoidal\n\npitch that precedes the more conventional centrifugal pump\nstage. It is however of note that in the case of the hydrogen\nupper stages of the Saturn V (at least), the mixture ratio was\n\u2018PU shifted\u2019 (propellant utilization shifted) part way\nthrough the burn, once the actual performance of the engine\nhad been determined, to ensure that the fuel and oxidizer\nwere used up at the same time.\n\nA few tripropellant liquid rocket engines have been\nproposed and even ground-tested. Examples include the\nLC3H8/LH2/LOX system proposed by R. Beichel while at\nAerojet, where LC3H8 is the fuel during liftoff, and LH2 at\naltitude; the NPO Energomash RD-701 which uses kero-\nsene/LGH2/LOX; and even F2/H2 ? Be. The design com-\nplication, toxicity and logistics of fluorine-containing\npropellants have prevented their utilization, although the\nspecific impulse would be higher than bipropellant systems;\na tripropellant system may have a specific impulse of\n[540 s, whereas a LOX/LH2 bipropellant system in vacuo\nmay attain a peak specific impulse of around 465 s.\n\n11.3.1 Engine Cycles\n\nLiquid rocket engines are thermodynamic machines and\nfollow thermodynamic cycles dominated by pressure. Pro-\npellants are compressed, burn at constant pressure, and\nexpand in the nozzle to produce the desired power, P \u00bc FV ,\nwhere V is the velocity of the vehicle. This is a simple\nBrayton-type cycle, but if turbopumps and a gas generator\nare present, the cycle becomes more complicated. Chamber\npressure and the expansion ratio (see Sect. 11.2) determine\nthe cycle efficiency; the maximum cycle pressure must be\nhigher than the chamber operating pressure, pc, to enable\nthe propellants to be injected at high speed and mix prop-\nerly, and thus require a certain \u2018head\u2019. A further constraint\nis imposed by combustion dynamics (instability), which\ndictates a minimum required pressure drop Dp through the\ninjector system in order to decouple unavoidable pressure\noscillations in the chamber from the feeding system. In fact,\nthe flow regime in the propellants feeding ducts is typically\nsubsonic, and in the absence of throttling between the\nchamber and the tanks, drives what is called \u2018pogo insta-\nbility\u2019. This Dp may be of order 10\u201350 bars, depending on\nthe chamber pressure and injection system.\n\nThe thermodynamic efficiency of space propulsion is a\nfunction of the area ratio (At/Ae), where subscript e is the\nnozzle exit, or pressure ratio, (pc/pe), and can be raised by\nsimply lengthening the conical (divergent) part of the nozzle,\nas the ambient pressure is zero, and (up to a point) it is more\nconvenient to increase Ae and thus lower pe than it is to raise\npc. The area ratio may even reach 400 with composite or\nceramic nozzle extensions or skirts that can move axially and\nform a longer, larger area ratio nozzle to increase expansion\n\nFig. 11.6 Test firing of the Atlas III propulsion system configured\nwith the Russian-designed RD-180 engine on November 4, 1998 at the\nMarshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Advanced Engine Test Facility.\nThe RD-180 is powered by kerosene and liquid oxygen.

In space applica-\ntions, pc may be limited to \\100 bars, but some space\nengines work at higher chamber pressure. The means of\nproducing pressure dictates the cycle.\n\nThe cycles of bipropellant liquid rocket engines may be\nopen or closed. Open cycles pre-burn a small amount of\n\npropellants (usually with a rich MR in order to limit exhaust\ngas temperature) in a gas generator that drives a single or\nseparate turbines which in turn, drive the propellant turbo-\npumps. The turbine exhaust is ejected to space or injected\ninto the nozzle divergent. Thus the fuel remaining in the\nrich turbine exhaust is wasted. In open cycles the turbo-\npumps need only to produce a head that is the sum of\npc \u00fe Dp\u00f0 \u00de, the pressure loss that is necessary to decouple\n\nthe feed system from the chamber and prevent self-sus-\ntained pressure oscillations. This Dp can be a fifth or sixth\nof the chamber pressure.\n\nA special case of open cycle for in-space LOX/LH2\npropulsion is the so-called expander cycle; it creates pres-\nsure by using LH2 to regeneratively cool the nozzle and\nchamber. The heat extracted vaporizes LH2, forming gas-\neous H2 to drive the turbopumps. An example is the Vinci\nengine, see Fig. 11.9, developed as the first European\nreignitable cryogenic upper stage engine for the Ariane 5\nlauncher. The LOX turbopump speed is 18,000 rpm, while\nthe LH2 turbopump speed is 90,000 rpm, delivering turbine\npowers of 350 kW (LOX) and 2,800 kW (LH2); the pro-\npellant flow rates are 33.7 kg/s (LOX) and 5.8 kg/s (LH2).\nVinci produces 180 kN of thrust in a vacuum by burning\nLOX/LH2 at MR = 5.8, with area ratio 240 (ceramic skirt\nfully extended).

Bruno\n\n\n\nabout 61 bars and the specific impulse 465 s. As the power\nis simply due to the expansion of LH2 to GH2, the power\ngenerated is much less than in a gas generator cycle, and the\nchamber pressure is limited to a few tens of bars, but the\nengine is much simpler, less expensive, and more reliable.\n\nClosed cycle liquid rocket engines, also called staged-\ncombustion cycles, have the equivalent of the gas generator,\nnow called a pre-burner, feeding combustion gas to the tur-\nbine (or turbines). In this case, however, the exhaust, still fuel\nrich, is not ejected overboard but injected into the combus-\ntion chamber, so that all of the fuel is eventually burned. The\ndownside is that in order to inject the turbine(s) exhaust into\nthe chamber the turbopumps must create a much higher head\nthan in an open cycle. Because the turbine must produce\nmuch more power to drive the turbopumps, the pre-burner\nsupplying the thermal power becomes almost as important as\nthe main combustion chamber. Compared to open cycles,\nclosed (staged) cycles are much more complex. Their higher\nspecific impulse is at the price of higher thermo-mechanical\nstresses and weight, so they are less common for in-space\npropulsion, where reliability is a key requirement.\n\nChamber pressure is a compromise between thermody-\nnamic efficiency/performance, and cost. Both the performance\n\nand weight of a liquid rocket engine increase with its chamber\npressure, and the crossing point depends on the propellant\ncombination, the technology available, and most importantly,\non the mission.\n\n11.3.2 Engine Cooling\n\nEngine cooling is critical to liquid rocket engine operation.\nThe local heat flux inside a chamber increases from the\ninjector plate to the throat as the surface area shrinks, and\nthen decreases in the diverging nozzle. The throat is the\nmost thermally loaded part of a liquid rocket engine, as seen\nin Fig. 11.8, with fluxes inversely proportional to the radius\nof the throat and of order MW/m2. Liquid rocket engine\ncooling may be active, with fuel being circulated inside the\nwalls of the engine, or passive, by radiation. The engine\nwalls may be actual pipes, assembled and brazed, as seen in\nFig. 11.10, to form the combustion chamber jacket. This is\nan efficient cooling strategy, but is also expensive because\neach pipe each must be tapered near the throat. This feature\nmaintains the propellant velocity near the hotter parts of the\nengine, and at the same times increases the mass flux, a\n\nFig. 11.9 Vinci reignitable\ncryogenic upper stage liquid\nengine. The expansion nozzle, is\nmade of a carbon-fiber ceramic\ncomposite material and weighs\n130 kg. It is shown both in its\nstowed configuration with a\nprotective shell surround the\nexpansion nozzle and in its\ndeployed configuration;\n2.37\u20134.2 m height, nozzle exit\ndiameter 2.2 m. Image ESA\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 293\n\n\n\ndesirable feature since the cooling requirement increases. A\ncooling jacket is more economical. In this case, the jacket is\nformed by an internal and an external surface, with brazed\nspacers between the two surfaces shaping coolant channels\nas required by the heat transfer. European liquid rocket\nengine technology typically uses cooling channels\nmachined from a solid copper block and closed by a thick\nelectrolytic nickel layer. In addition to circulating propel-\nlant, it is common practice to inject fuel through slots or\norifices on the injector plate close to the engine sidewall in\norder to keep the wall wetted by a film of cold fuel and\nthereby insulate it from the combustion gases.\n\nRadiative cooling is more practical for low thrust\nengines. Attitude control thrusters, monopropellant liquid\nrocket engine, and generally engines with a thrust of less\nthan 104 N are not actively cooled; they may be manufac-\ntured using refractory metals such as niobium or rhenium,\nor more recently also ceramics such as silicon carbide (SiC),\nsilicon nitride, trisilicon tetranitride (Si3N4), and carbon or\nSiC composites. The power radiated is a net energy loss, but\nthat can be partially made up by the greater expansion ratio\navailable. In any case, all the complications of manufac-\nturing and operating active cooling systems are entirely\navoided. Expander cycles engines have limited circulation\ncapability, so only the chamber proper may be actively\ncooled; the diverging part of the nozzle and the nozzle\nextensions, if any, may be made of ceramic or composite,\nand cooled by radiation.\n\nAnother form of passive cooling is based on ablative\nmaterials. Single-use liquid rocket engines may have the inner\nwalls of their chamber coated with poorly conducting, silica-\nreinforced epoxy or phenolic resins. The coating may be of the\norder of a few millimeters thick, decreasing over time due to\nthe endothermic reactions between the ablative and the com-\nbustion gases. While the ablating surface reacts and is con-\nsumed, the thermal wave penetrates only a fraction of its\nthickness, maintaining the underlying structure at a reasonably\nlow temperature. Ablative coatings may work more than once,\nbut because their performance is not 100 % predictable they\npose a risk if the engine is required to be restartable.\n\n11.3.3 Liquid Rocket Engine Operation\n\nEven at the \u2018high\u2019 specific impulse of 450\u2013460 s, the\nworking time of a space liquid rocket engine is limited to\nseveral minutes due to propellant consumption. For exam-\nple, an RL-10 engine at 110 kN thrust and specific impulse\n465 s burns its propellants at the rate F=Isp\n\n? ?\n\u00bc 24 kg/s.\n\nMissions with liquid rocket engine propulsion often\nrequire engine restartability in order, for instance, to circu-\nlarize an orbit or to inject the spacecraft into a Hohmann\ntrajectory, or to make a planetary landing. Multiple restart\n(re-ignition) is sometimes critical, for instance in interplan-\netary missions. Hypergolic propellants react as soon as they\ncome into contact, and can be restarted any number of times.\n\nFig. 11.10 The Pratt & Whitney-Rocketdyne Common Extensible\nCryogenic Engine (CECE), based on the design of the heritage RL-10\nengine, a deep-throttling 15,000 pound (*67 kN) thrust technology\ndevelopment engine fueled by a mixture of 90 K liquid oxygen and\n20 K liquid hydrogen. The engine components are super-cooled to\n\nsimilarly low temperatures. As the CECE burns its frigid fuels, gas\ncomposed of hot steam is produced and propelled out the nozzle to\ncreate thrust. The steam is cooled by the cold engine nozzle, condenses\nand eventually freezes at the nozzle exit to form icicles. Image Pratt &\nWhitney-Rocketdyne\n\n294 C. Bruno\n\n\n\nLiquid rocket engines with non-hypergolic propellants need\nreliable ignition systems built into their design from the very\nbeginning. Thrust control is a second critical issue for some\nmissions. For landing on bodies such as the Moon or Mars,\nthe engine must be throttable. While most liquid rocket\nengines may be capable of varying their thrust between, say,\n95 and 102 % of nominal, there are several engines whose\nthrust may be reduced by a factor[1. One such example is\nthe Common Extensible Cryogenic Engine (CECE) engine\nbuilt by Pratt & Whitney-Rocketdyne for lunar landings; see\nFig. 11.10. Alternatively, the thrust may be controlled by\npulsing periodically the engine, or (much more expensively)\nby subdividing thrust among many individual chambers, and\nigniting as many as are needed to obtain the thrust desired.\n\n11.3.4 Operational Problems\n\nLiquid rocket engines suffer from instability problems due to\ninteractions among the physical mechanisms that control\nheat release. Cryogenic engines with gaseous hydrogen and\nLOX injection are supposed to be free of combustion insta-\nbilities, but are not always so. On the other hand, instability is\na serious problem with the liquid/liquid injection scheme\n(typically, with hypergolic mixtures). Instability manifests\nitself by chamber pressure oscillations around the nominal\nvalue in time and space, there being longitudinal, tangential\nand radial oscillation modes. Some of the modes and their\nharmonics are acoustic, but there may be finite-amplitude\nmodes, especially following startup and hard starts in gen-\neral. All modes tend to cause problems, for instance by\nsweeping the wall boundary layer and thus sharply increasing\nthe transfer of heat to the chamber wall. The presence of a\nliquid phase due to atomization of both fuel and oxidizer adds\nto acoustic modes generated by the effect of pressure waves\non combustion kinetics. In-space liquid rocket engines tend,\nas a class, to be smaller than the first- or even third-stage\nengines of a launch vehicle, so harmonics and unstable\nmodes tend to have higher frequencies, and sometimes that is\nbeneficial, because it makes them more difficult to excite.\nNevertheless, instability is an unpleasant fact with liquid\nrocket engines, and its abatement and control consumes most\nof the ground testing time.\n\nNozzle non-equilibrium effects are similar to those in\nlaunchers, but the lower pressure in the nozzle expansion\nslows further radical recombination and causes performance\nlosses. In a nozzle, the hot combustion gas expands and\ncools, converting chemical and thermal energy into kinetic\nenergy. Moving downstream, the gas accelerates, and there\nis less and less time for this conversion. Eventually, at a\ncertain station of the nozzle the rate of pressure and tem-\nperature drop becomes faster than the rate of conversion, the\nflow composition and temperature stay unchanged, and the\n\ngas flow is said to be chemically \u2018frozen\u2019: from that station\non, the fraction of internal energy that is not converted into\nkinetic energy is lost.\n\nA second source of losses occurs in very small engines\n(micro-thrusters for certain small satellites), because vis-\ncous effects become important below certain sizes (say, at\nReynolds number, Re, below 100). The Reynolds number\ndecreases along a nozzle because as the gas velocity\nincreases, its density decreases faster. For such small\nengines, the radial velocity profile is no longer flat, it\nbecomes parabolic, and the cross-section average velocity is\nless than that predicted by the classic one-dimensional\nrocket relationships. Realistic predictions of performance\nrequire simulations of the engine flow-field in detail.\n\n11.3.5 Propellants and Performance\n\nThe one-dimensional rocket equations in Sect. 11.2 show\nthat liquid rocket engine performance depends on the\nthermodynamic efficiency (pressure ratio), which in turn\ndepends on the geometry of the engine (area ratio) and on\nthe ratio between the combustion temperature, Tc, and the\naverage molecular weight, MW, of the combustion products.\nThe pressure ratio depends on the propellants only in terms\nof the specific heat capacity ratio, c = (cp/cv), but their\nchemical kinetics determine the \u2018frozen\u2019 losses in the noz-\nzle. Other key considerations in choosing propellant com-\nbinations are their combined, or bulk, density (density\nweighted with the propellants mass fractions), the mixture\nratio because it impacts on the design and size of the tur-\nbopumps, their possible toxicity, corrosiveness, logistics\nand handling problems, and cost. Even after much trial and\nerror since the 1940s, current bipropellant combinations are\nrelatively few, the most successful being LOX/LH2, LOX/\nkerosene, NTO/N2H4 and NTO/MMH. Recent emphasis on\n\u2018green\u2019 propellants has raised interest in fuels such as eth-\nane and ethanol. Dozens of combinations have been tried\nand used for some period in the past, and the discussion\nbelow may clarify why so few remain in use.\n\n11.3.5.1 Liquid Oxygen/Liquid Hydrogen\n(LOX/LH2)\n\nAs predicted by Tsiolkovsky, in space the LOX/LH2 com-\nbination is the best performing, with a theoretical specific\nimpulse of 465 s for an area ratio of 200. Both propellants are\ncryogenic. LH2 requires to be kept at about 20 K and it took a\nlong time for the US and the former Soviet Union to master\nthis technology. The other countries that have succeeded\ninclude France, Japan, China, and India. LH2 is about a factor\nof 20 more expensive than kerosene. The stoichiometric\nreaction H2 ? ? O2 ? H2O, produces about 59 kcal/mol\nand has a MR = 8. The actual MR to achieve the maximum\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 295\n\n\n\nspecific impulse in space is about 6. Because this mixture is\nabout 30 % rich, the adiabatic combustion temperature is not\nthe highest obtainable, but the average molecular weight of\nthe exhaust, which is about 10 due to the unburnt hydrogen, is\nmuch lower than for the stoichiometric mixture (about 18).\nLH2 is supercritical when pumped and is therefore an\nexcellent engine coolant. The heat that it extracts gasifies the\nliquid and raises its temperature to 250\u2013300 K. The gaseous\nH2 is then injected by means of coaxial injectors through the\nlarger cross-section annulus coaxial to the central LOX\n\u2018post\u2019. The lower density of gaseous hydrogen (GH2) results\nin injection velocities of the order of 100 m/s, while the\ndenser LOX enters the chamber through its central post at\nonly a few meters per second. The energy yield and cooling\nare outstanding qualities for a liquid rocket engine, especially\nfor the first stage of a launcher. However, LH2 cannot be\nstored in space for long periods, as it evaporates. Active\ncryocoolers have been investigated, but the ratio between the\nheat extracted and the energy used to extract it is currently\nstill of the order of 1/30 to 1/100. Hydrogen may be kept\nliquid only by active cooling or by steady evaporation, at a\nrate that depends on tank insulation and on exposure to\nsunlight. At a warm-side temperature of 350 K, good mul-\ntilayer insulation transmits 0.28 W/m2, and because LH2\ntanks are bulky (the density of LH2 at 20.4 K is only about\n0.07 kg/m3) boil-off is significant. Advances in insulation\nstrategy have made passive storage competitive in space for\ntimes up to 60 days, and for a 5\u201310 t cryo upper stage (1\u20132 t\nof LH2) in-space active cryocooling of LH2 has been dem-\nonstrated with a power consumption of less than 1 kW (10 W\nat 20 K). Poor space storability and low bulk density are the\nmain disadvantages of LH2 as a space propulsion fuel. With\nLOX, this combination is \u2018green\u2019, producing only water.\nGround handling is relatively benign, but the wide flamma-\nbility limits of hydrogen and oxygen mixtures always pose a\nrisk, prevented in practice by appropriate safety measures\nand operating procedures.\n\n11.3.5.2 Liquid Oxygen/Hydrocarbon (LOX/HC)\nThe combination LOX/kerosene is better suited to boosters\nand launchers because it is denser, having a bulk density of\nabout 1.4 relative to water. LOX is partially space storable,\nas it vaporizes below its critical pressure (50 bars); kero-\nsene is fully storable. This combination delivers a specific\nimpulse of approximately 357 s with a nozzle area ratio of\n40. The combustion products are mainly CO2 and water;\nboth are considered \u2018green\u2019, but because RP-1 contains\ncycloalkanes and aromatics, it is slightly toxic, although\nless so than gasoline. Very similar specific impulses are\nobtained with other hydrocarbon fuels, for instance liquid\nmethane (LCH4) and liquid ethanol (LC2H6), which are\nmuch cheaper than hydrogen and have better handling\ncharacteristics and logistics.\n\nLOX/kerosene engines need an ignition system, hence\nengine restarting is problematic. Furthermore, any fuel that\nremains in the ducts after turning the engine off pyrolyzes\nquickly to form carbon deposits (\u2018coking\u2019). To some extent,\nthis happens with all hydrocarbons. Coking depends on\ncombustion temperature and pressure, impurities in the fuel\n(no commercial hydrocarbon is pure), and catalytic reac-\ntions with metallic surfaces. In the worst cases, valves may\nbe clogged after only a few minutes of operation. Kerosene\nused in the US for rocket propulsion is a special blend\n(military specification MIL-P-25576C) called RP-1 (Rocket\nPropellant-1 or Refined Petroleum-1) and is more expensive\nthan commercial kerosene; for comparison, at the time of\nthe Apollo program the cost was 1.45 US$/gallon versus\n0.27 US$/gallon for gasoline (1 gallon is approximately\n4.546 l). The RP-1 blend was formulated to reduce coking\nwhile maintaining a specific density of 0.81\u20130.82 in order to\nreduce tank volume. The average carbon to hydrogen ratio\nof RP-1 is about 1.953.\n\nFor optimum specific impulse the MR is 2.77 with kero-\nsene, 3.45 with LCH4 and 3.10 with C2H6 (ethane). Signifi-\ncant experience exists in Russia and Ukraine with LOX/\nkerosene combinations. LCH4 was used in the former Soviet\nUnion, and is currently undergoing testing both in the US and\nin Europe as an alternative to both kerosene and hydrogen. Its\nproperties are intermediate between the two: LCH4 has far\nbetter cooling capability than kerosene, and far less than\nhydrogen; it is much denser than LH2, but less so than ker-\nosene, and it has less tendency to coke. Injection of LOX/RP-\n1 in the Rocketdyne F-1 engine of the Saturn V for Apollo\nwas through like-on-like and like-unlike impinging jets; in\nRussian designs coaxial ducts are more common.\n\n11.3.5.3 Hypergolic Combinations\nHypergolic combinations in current use are based on\nhydrazine or its mono- and unsymmetrical dimethyl com-\npounds (MMH and UDMH) as fuel, and nitrogen tetroxide\n(NTO) as oxidizer. These propellants can be stored for\nyears, but NTO must then be supplemented with nitric oxide\n(NO). The combustion products depend on the hydrazine\ncompound. With straight hydrazine (N2H4) they are mainly\nN2 and H2O, but NxHy species may be present. With MMH\nand UMDH, CO2 and H2O are also main products. Both\npropellants are dense liquids at room temperature, and both\nare hazardous and toxic. Their specific impulse perfor-\nmances are very similar, about 340 s with an area ratio of\n40. The optimum MR is about 2.4 for MMH, 2.15 for\nUDMH and 1.4 for neat hydrazine. Because they are all\nhypergolic, pipe joints and valves must be designed with\nhigh tolerances to prevent leaks and catastrophic single-\npoint failures. For the same reason, multiple restarts pose no\nproblem because ignition and extinction are performed by\nsimply opening and closing the propellants valves. These\n\n296 C. Bruno\n\n\n\ncombinations are preferred for spacecraft attitude control\nand orbital maneuvering. Fuel and oxidizer are injected\nfrom pressurized tanks through separate orifices on the\ninjection plate. The liquid jets are angled to make them\nimpinge at a distance from the plate sufficient to protect the\nplate from overheating. Hydrazine, MMH and UDMH are\nall relatively stable with temperature, and can be circulated\nto regeneratively cool the engine walls without decompos-\ning. Table 11.5 summarizes some properties of the most\ncommon propellants discussed.\n\n11.3.6 Monopropellants\n\nThe two most commonly used monopropellants are hydra-\nzine (N2H4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).\n\n11.3.6.1 Hydrogen Peroxide\nTo optimize performance, H2O2 must contain as little water\nas possible. In fact, the heat released by its decomposition\n(H2O2 ? H2O ? O) is capable of vaporizing completely\nthe peroxide at a concentration exceeding approximately\n70 %. Above 85 %, H2O2 is called high-test peroxide\n(HTP). Anhydrous peroxide is difficult and very expensive\nto produce; the highest available concentration is about\n98 %, and its density is 1.44 g/cm3.\n\nHTP tends to decompose in tanks and release heat: in\nfact, it reacts with most metal or impurity traces. These\ncatalyze the reaction H2O2 ? H2O ? O, although less so at\nthe highest concentration. Very pure aluminum tanks are\nbest, and special additives (e.g. tin salts) have been found\nthat slow decomposition even further, to the point that HTP\ncan be used for orbital maneuvering and attitude control;\ncompatibility with catalyst must be always checked. The\nsame reaction is desirable inside the catalytic reactor, which\nmay even consist of a simple silver screen, but that will melt\nreadily because the temperature of the decomposition\nreaction is about 1,543 K. Platinum and other proprietary\n\ncatalysts (e.g. based on iron oxides) are also used. The\nspecific impulse obtainable is of order 189\u2013195 s, and\ndecomposition starts as soon as the valve opens and lets the\nperoxide wet the catalytic bed. HTP is toxic, but the real\nhazard is its high reactivity, producing burns when in con-\ntact with any type of organic material.\n\n11.3.6.2 Hydrazine\nHydrazine (N2H4) is historically the first and by far most\nreliable monopropellant. Its shelf life inside certain types of\nstainless steel, or aluminum alloy tanks, can be measured in\nyears, and experience exists over decades of use in attitude\ncontrol systems, station-keeping for geostationary satellites\nand orbital maneuvering. A hydrazine motor consists of an\ninjector, a catalyst bed, and a chamber ending in a con-\nventional nozzle. Over the catalyst bed, the exothermic\ndecomposition of N2H4 takes place in two steps, the first\nexothermic and the second endothermic i.e.\n\n3 N2H4 ! 4 NH3 \u00fe N2\n4 NH3 ! 2 N2 \u00fe 6 H2:\n\nThe second step (ammonia decomposition) is slow\ncompared to the first. The longer the residence time over the\ncatalyst, the more ammonia (NH3) is converted to nitrogen\nand hydrogen. This fact can be exploited to control the\ntrade-off between specific impulse performance and the\ncombustion temperature, Tc. At 6.8 bars pressure, and an\narea ratio 50, a short catalyst bed produces ammonia and a\nmaximum specific impulse of 260 s, but the temperature is\n1,700 K. Dropping the catalyst temperature to 1,273 K\nprolongs catalyst life considerably but reduces the specific\nimpulse to 245 s. The catalyst lasts longer at lower tem-\nperatures. Increasing the bed/residence time so that all\nammonia is converted can reduce the combustion temper-\nature to about 870 K and the catalyst life is accordingly\neven longer, but the specific impulse is only 210 s. The\nengine designer must therefore choose appropriately the bed\nlength and injection velocity.\n\nTable 11.5 Some properties of commonly used space propellants\n\nPropellant Critical temperature\n(K)\n\nCritical pressure\n(bars)\n\nBoiling temperature\n(K)\n\nLiquid density\n(g/cm3)\n\nHeat of vaporization\n(kcal/kg)\n\nLH2 69 12 20 0.071 107\n\nLO2 115 50.1 90 1.14 50.9\n\nLCH4 192 45.8 112 0.423 122\n\nRP-1 675 21.4 450\u2013547 0.82 74\n\nHydrazine\n(N2H4)\n\n653 145 387 1.004 300\n\nMMH 585 75 361 0.866 183\n\nUDMH 523 49.3 337 0.971 126\n\nNTO (N2O4) 431 91.4 185 1.55 96\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 297\n\n\n\nAs with H2O2, the thrust can be controlled simply by the\nopening and closing of a valve. Fast acting valves can deliver\nthrust pulses very precisely and reliably; that is, with mini-\nmum dribbling. For attitude control, hydrazine thrusters may\nconsist of groups of three or even four independently fueled\nthrusters (to increase reliability), oriented in the three main\nspacecraft or satellite axes. A single fuel or oxidizer tank\nfeeds all of the thrusters, but their valving is independent.\n\nThe current emphasis on \u2018green\u2019 propellants has pro-\nduced a possible non-toxic competitor to hydrazine, called\nLMP-103S by its manufacturer, ECAPS of Sweden. It is\ncomposed of ammonium dinitramide, water, methanol and\nammonia. It decomposes at higher temperatures than\nhydrazine into water, N2, H2 and CO/CO2, with a specific\nimpulse of about 265 s. It was successfully tested on the\nSwedish Mango and Tango satellites launched in 2010. The\ncatalyst life is for the moment shorter than with hydrazine.\n\n11.4 Hybrid Rockets\n\nHybrid rocket engines (HRE) are a class of propulsion sys-\ntems that were introduced in the 1930s; work on the GIRD-9\n(Soviet) LOX/jellified gasoline 60 lbf (267 N) thrust motor\nbuilt by Mikhail Tikhonravov (1900\u20131974) and Sergei Pav-\nlovich Korolev (1907\u20131966) began in 1932 and it first flight\nin August, 1933. The hybrid rocket engine concept is to burn\na solid fuel with a liquid oxidizer. Most of the fuels tested are\npolymers, such as polyethylene (PE), hydroxy terminated\npolybutadiene (HTPB), which are also used in solid propel-\nlants, or methyl-metacrylates (commercially: PlexiglasTM).\nTypical oxidizers are LOX and H2O2.\n\nThe reason for developing hybrid rocket engines is their\nhistorically perceived greater simplicity than both solid and\nliquid systems. Compared to a SRM, a hybrid motors hosts a\nsimpler and cheaper fuel grain (not a propellant grain), and\nits thrust can be controlled by regulating the oxidizer flow\nrate; and compared to liquid rocket engines, a HRM has a\nsingle liquid propellant tank and a single turbopump (or\npressurization system). The working pressure of a hybrid\nrocket engine is a few tens of bars, and is determined by the\ninjection pressure. With a simple polymer fuel, the com-\nbustion products consist of CO2 and H2O. SpaceShipOne\nwas powered by a hybrid rocket using HTPB and nitrous\noxide (N2O), and that has focused attention to this oxidizer.\nWith N2O there will be also N2 and perhaps traces of amines\namong the combustion products. N2O is a gas that can be\nliquefied relatively easily for storage and is non-toxic, but\ndecomposes exothermically once sufficiently heated.\n\nTheoretically, the specific impulse of hybrid rocket\nengines is intermediate between that of liquid and solid\nsystems, in the 300 to 330 s range, depending on the oxi-\ndizer. Thus, in principle, hybrid rocket engines for in-space\n\npropulsion and their inherent \u2018restartability\u2019 would facilitate\nmultiple burns at lower cost. Figure 11.11 shows a notional\nhybrid rocket engine. This comprises the liquid oxidizer\ntank, the line feeding oxidizer to the rocket chamber via a\nconventional injector, and the fuel grain inside the chamber.\nEven for large-scale applications, turbopumps would pose\nmajor problems, so the tank is simply pressurized. This\nlimits the operating chamber pressure to a few tens of bars.\n\nSimilar to SRMs, the solid fuel is shaped as a grain with a\ncentral port whose cross-section is shaped to control the total\nsurface/volume ratio for optimum combustion. The poly-\nmeric fuel containing CxHy groups such as CH2 or CH py-\nrolyzes due to the radiation from the flame and due to\nconvection. The products of pyrolysis react with the oxidizer,\nwhich is LOX, N2O, or H2O2. The reaction occurs where the\nmixture fuel/oxidizer is stoichiometric, thus at a certain\ndistance from the surface. The surface regresses much like in\na SRM, except the mechanism is driven exclusively by the\nheat feedback to the fuel surface, and is slower. The regres-\nsion rate of commonly used polymers is much smaller than\nthat of solid rocket motor propellant, a few mm/s at most.\n\nHybrid rocket engines are still in a protracted develop-\nment phase, and should be rated perhaps more in terms of\ntheir safety and cost than their performance. They suffer\nfrom several basic shortcomings. Ideally, combustion should\ntake place near or at the stoichiometric mixture layer.\nHowever, because of the time needed to vaporize it, the\noxidizer may mix with the pyrolyzed fuel while still in\nthe form of a spray of droplets. This is typically the case near\nthe entrance of the port, and reactivity is low there. In\naddition, fuels like HTPB or polyethylene pyrolyze slowly.\nThus, the burning rate peaks toward the grain end, and much\nfuel (10\u201315 %) may remain unburned. This is also due to the\ndifficulty of ensuring that the liquid not only vaporizes, but\nalso reaches the entire fuel surface, and in the right amount,\nwhile it atomizes and is convected downstream. This limits\nthe effective thrust. Increasing the motor surface area by\nmultiple ports increases at the same time its volume. In space\nthat does not matter, but the motor has to be lifted into orbit,\nand a bulkier payload implies a bigger aerodynamic fairing,\nmore drag and more structural weight. Also, low-frequency\ninstability is common during hybrid rocket engine operation.\n\n11.4.1 Hybrid Rocket Engine Evolution\n\nMuch of the research in hybrid rocket engines has gone into\nways of increasing their thrust by increasing the contact\nbetween liquid and solid fuel. An obvious way is to increase\nthe port area, shaping the grain cross-section as a wagon\nwheel, for instance. This creates multiple independent ports.\nHowever, any multi-cavity configuration of the fuel grain\ntends to weaken it mechanically, and the regression rate\n\n298 C. Bruno\n\n\n\ntends to be non-uniform from port to port due to differences\nin the oxidizer flow rate delivered to each port.\n\nCombustion in hybrid rocket engines occurs via a classic\ndiffusion flame where the fuel is produced by the flame heat\nfeedback, as in an ordinary candle. It is the heat feedback\nfrom this flame that pyrolyzes the solid fuel by transferring\nheat to the solid surface by a combination of radiation and\nalso convection. Thus, the burning rate is controlled by the\nrate of inter-diffusion of fuel and oxidizer that must first mix\nin order to react.\n\nTo increase the burning rate, and thus reduce the grain\nbulk and increase the thrust for a given volume, necessitates\nthe use of one of the following strategies\n\u2022 Increase the surface area of the fuel in contact with the\n\noxidizer\n\u2022 Increase heat transfer between hot gas and surface\n\u2022 Increase reactivity between gas and oxidizer.\n\nThe first approach is similar to, or the same as, that used\nfor SRMs. The grain must be milled to have as much of its\ncross-section consisting of empty space (ports) where the\noxidizer may enter and react with the fuel as it pyrolyzes.\nThere is an obvious compromise between the surface area\nthat can be achieved and the structural grain integrity\nduring combustion and spacecraft acceleration. Further-\nmore, as the grain is consumed, the walls in between ports\nget thinner, the burning inside the different ports is uneven,\nand eventually slivers of fuel detach and are carried\ndownstream, toward the nozzle throat. Once removed, they\nrarely burn completely. In addition, a multi-port cross-\nsection increases the burning surface at the expense of the\nbulk density (density/unit bulk volume). For this reason\nhybrid rocket engines tend to be more voluminous than\nSRMs, and launching them is more expensive due to the\nextra drag.\n\nThe second approach is based on increasing the oxidizer\nturbulence in the port(s) so that the turbulent layer over the\nfuel surface, where combustion occurs, becomes thinner,\nand thus the heat transfer is faster. The mixture ratio to\nproduce the optimum specific impulse is fixed once the\nchamber pressure and nozzle have been fixed, as is the\noxidizer mass flow rate, which is equal to the product of the\nvelocity, cross-section, and density. The Reynolds number\nthat determines the intensity of turbulence scales with the\nproduct of these three factors. It may be increased only by\n\nreducing the port area, but as the fuel surface decreases so\nwill the flow rate of pyrolyzed fuel. Thus, this approach has\nlimitations if done conventionally. Recent work has pro-\nduced more innovative ideas. An example is single-port\ngrains, where the oxidizer swirls and more rapidly and more\ncompletely consumes the fuel, since the gaseous boundary\nlayer swept by the swirling flow becomes much thinner.\nThis concept is being developed by ORBITEC in the US,\nand is called \u2018vortex hybrid\u2019. The disadvantage is that\nmulti-port grains would need multiple swirling oxidizer\ninjectors, one to each port, thereby increasing both com-\nplexity and cost. In practice, this approach is currently\nsuitable only for small thrust hybrid rocket engines, but it\nmay eventually find a niche in space propulsion. A second\ninnovative approach, developed at University of Hokkaido,\nJapan, divides the fuel grain into segments, with empty\nspaces in between. Each segment has two or three ports, but\nthese are staggered with respect to the next segment so that\nthe hot combustion products are forced to recirculate before\npassing through the next set of ports. As in the swirling\nstrategy, it is this recirculation that increases the rate of heat\ntransfer to the fuel and its pyrolysis.\n\nThe third approach is newer. It consists of replacing the\npolymers with much more easily vaporized waxes (e.g.\nsolid paraffin). The endothermic heat of pyrolysis of com-\nmon waxes is a fraction of that for polymers, so more fuel is\navailable to the oxidizer per unit time, and the diffusion-\ncontrolled combustion is faster. This has been shown to\nhave a positive effect. For instance, solid waxes leave less\nunburnt fuel (slivers). However, compared to polymers,\nwaxes have much weaker mechanical properties, especially\nin hot environments. In space that may become a problem if\nexposure to the heat of solar flux is prolonged.\n\nA further concept is to use fuels that are \u2018doped\u2019 with\noxidizing agents or metal particles. Metal particles increase\nthe flame temperature and radiate intensely inside the flame.\nMetal nano-particles work best, but they are expensive, and\nmixing them into the fuel poses manufacturing problems.\nNano-particles of metals that burn to oxides with a high\nadiabatic flame temperature, are boron, aluminum and zir-\nconium and their hydrides. Hydrides release hydrogen when\nburning, thus contributing to energetic kinetics and total\nheat release. With this strategy, the supposedly \u2018cheap\u2019 fuel\nactually becomes similar to a solid propellant.\n\nFig. 11.11 Notional scheme of a hybrid rocket engine. The liquid oxidizer is pressure-fed to the injector. Image Creative Commons\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 299\n\n\n\nAlthough the first two strategies may increase combustion\ncompleteness, they also tend to increase the overall pressure\ndrop, with a negative effect on thrust and specific impulse.\nThe first strategy probably requires abandoning conventional\ndesigns. The turbulent transport of oxidizer to the surface can\nbe obtained with unconventional designs that increase the\nrecirculation zones and thus the residence time of the fuel\nand oxidizer mixture. This can be seen as transforming\nhybrid rocket engines from a propulsion system similar to a\nSRM, to something closer to a gas generator.\n\n11.4.2 Hybrid Rocket Engine Burning\n\nEmpirical formulations of the regression rate of the solid\nfuel are used in determining the performance and design of\nhybrid rocket engine. The regression rate, r, concept is used\nas in SRMs, but it is no longer a characteristic of the fuel\nbecause it depends on the details of the heat transfer from\nthe boundary layer flame. The regression rate is correlated\nto the oxidizer \u2018mass averaged velocity\u2019,Gox, defined as the\noxidizer mass flow rate divided by the total port area, giving\nthe regression rate in units of distance by time as\n\nr \u00bc a Gox\u00f0 \u00den \u00f011:19\u00de\n\nwhere a and n are empirical parameters. For instance, with\nthe combination HTPB and LOX, a \u00bc 0:104 and n = 0.681\n(here r is in inches per second, and Gox in pound-mass per\nsecond per square inch, lbm/(s in2)). The value of the\nregression rate depends on the fuel and on the operational\nconditions; experiments show regression rates of 1\u20134 mm/s,\nbut these numbers are merely indicative because heat\ntransfer and pyrolysis depend on the specifics of the motor,\nnot just on the propellants. With solid paraffin fuel\na \u00bc 0:488, and although n \u00bc 0:62, the regression rate is a\nfactor of three faster. Pressure dependence (expected by the\ncombustion mode, based on a diffusion flame) is implicit in\nGox. However, other empirical relationships for the regres-\nsion rate include an explicit chamber pressure dependence,\nwith r \u00bc a Gox\u00f0 \u00den pc\u00f0 \u00dem.\n\nAs with other chemical engines that operate at a multi-\ntude of characteristic times which may couple, hybrid\nrocket engines are subject to instabilities. Unlike SRM and\nliquid rocket motors, hybrid motors have not been observed\nto self-destruct due to excessive pressure growth. Pogo, or\nchugging instability due to coupling between chamber\npressure and tank feed system, can be cured by a suitable\npressure drop across the liquid injector, as in liquid rocket\nengines. Acoustic instabilities are more difficult to cure as in\nthe case of liquid rocket engines, and indicate that the\nacoustics of the ports and of the motor case need to be\nmodified.\n\n11.4.3 Hybrid Rocket Engine Performance\n\nThe American Rocket Company (AMROC) tested hybrid\nrocket engines, with thrusts from 44 to 334 kN, including a\nvery large H-1800 motor in the early 1990s to demonstrate\npractically the capability of hybrid rocket engines to replace\nsolid boosters; it developed a thrust of 1.1 MN during a\nsingle run, but exhibited instability and combustion was\nincomplete. Later, in 1999, a consortium of aerospace\ncompanies, working under NASA\u2019s Hybrid Propulsion\nDevelopment Program, tested a motor with the same thrust,\nagain for application to boosters. The nominal chamber\npressure was 61 bars, and the test lasted 80 s. Combustion\nroughness was observed. These were the largest hybrid\nmotors ever tested; they demonstrated both the advantages\nand problems of this type of propulsion.\n\nThe peak specific impulse of LOX with HTPB fuel in\nvacuo is obtained theoretically for MR = 2 and is about\n330 s; with H2O2 the optimum MR is 6, and the specific\nimpulse is about 300 s. These are ideal calculated numbers.\nIn 2002, Lockheed-Martin flight-tested its Hybrid Sounding\nRocket (HYSR) sounding rocket, powered by a hybrid\nrocket engine with a thrust of 270 kN.\n\nThe most celebrated application of a hybrid rocket engine\nwas in the suborbital SpaceShipOne vehicle built by Scaled\nComposites and SpaceDev, which won the X-Prize in 2004.\nThis hybrid rocket engine used liquid N2O and HTPB, and\nproduced 88 kN of thrust. Similar to H2O2, the N2O\ndecomposed exothermically, and there was a risk of the flame\nflashing back from the injector to the tank. A flashback was\nresponsible for the explosion of the hybrid rocket at Scaled\nComposites in 2007 that killed three people.\n\nHybrid motors are subject to low-frequency (1\u2013100 Hz)\ninstability. However, the pressure does not grow cata-\nstrophically, as it can in liquid and solid systems. \u2018Chug-\nging\u2019 is fairly common at low oxidizer flow rates, when\nturning the thrust down. With LOX, the main mechanism\nfor instability is recognized to be the time lag of vaporizing\nthe LOX droplets, just as in a liquid rocket engines.\n\nAlthough still not mature, hybrid rocket engine tech-\nnology shows promise where safety, not performance, is the\nkey requirement.\n\n11.5 Electric Propulsion Fundamentals\n\nElectric propulsion is a technology based on accelerating\nmatter by means of electric forces. To do that, the matter\nmust first be ionized. The forces that can accelerate it may\nbe electrostatic (Coulomb) or electrodynamic (Lorentz).\nThe first needs only an electric field, i.e. a voltage differ-\nence, and the force between two point-like charges q1 and\nq2 at distance r is\n\n300 C. Bruno\n\n\n\nF \u00bc Kq1q2\nr\n\nr3\n\u00f011:20\u00de\n\nwhere the constant K = 1/(4pe0). The vacuum permittivity\ne0 is 8.854 9 10\n\n-12 Farads per meter (F/m). The Lorentz\nforce acts in the simultaneous presence of an electric and a\nmagnetic field, and for a single charge, e, it is simply\n\nF \u00bc eU? B \u00f011:21\u00de\n\nwhere U is the velocity of the point-like charge e, and B is\nthe magnetic induction. For a fluid mixture composed by\ni \u00bc 1; 2; . . .N ionized species, with charge density qiqi,\nsubject to both an electric field, E, and a magnetic field, B,\nthe total electric (body) force acting on the ith component of\nthe mixture is\n\nF \u00bc qiqi E\u00fe Ui ? B\u00f0 \u00de \u00f011:22\u00de\n\nThis force must be added to the Navier-Stokes\nmomentum equations. Note that the Lorentz force depends\non velocity, so is not Galilean invariant, and this moti-\nvated the use of the Lorentz transformation in Special\nRelativity. A rigorous simulation of the effects of electric\nforces on a charged fluid with charge density qiqi would\nrequire adding all of Maxwell equations and all of the\nboundary conditions. The complexity of electric thrusters\nhas resulted instead in shapes and practices that by trial\nand error over half a century have yielded good or\npromising results for thrust and specific impulse. Thus,\nthis technology is still in a development phase, and there\nare no simple relationships to predict thrust and specific\nimpulse with good accuracy. Most often, power given as\ninput is empirically correlated to thrust by direct\nmeasurements.\n\nTo accelerate ionized gas, the gas density must be suf-\nficiently low that collisions do not recombine ions and\nelectrons. Thus, the residence time in the region inside\nan electric thruster using, for instance, the Coulomb\nforce, must be shorter than the average time between\ncollisions. Recombination between an ion I+ and an elec-\ntron e- occurs through a three-way collision with any third\nbody M present\n\nI\u00fe \u00fe e? \u00feM ! I \u00feM?: \u00f011:23\u00de\n\nM is any third body capable of absorbing the recombination\nenergy, and its state M* indicates that after the three-body\ncollision, M leaves in an excited state. The rate of recom-\nbination is thus proportional to the concentrations of all\nthree collision partners simultaneously, and therefore scales\nwith pressure cubed: the higher the pressure, the larger is\nthe probability that ions and electrons will recombine. This\nlimits the maximum pressure of electric thrusters based on\nthe Coulomb force.\n\nSimilarly, if the thruster uses the Lorentz force, the tra-\njectories of ions and electrons, for constant and uniform E\nand B, will be spirals around the magnetic field lines of\nconstant value. If the spiraling period (gyration time) is\nshorter than the collision time then the Lorentz force will\nhave time to act and will accelerate the ions and electrons;\notherwise, the ionized gas is said to be \u2018collisional\u2019 and the\nkinetic energy imparted by the Lorentz force will be \u2018dis-\nsipated\u2019 through inelastic collisions and become heat. The\nratio between the gyration time and the collision time in\nthe gas is the so-called Hall parameter. In ionized gas the\npercentage of ions may be seemingly \u2018low\u2019, say 10 %, but\nthe high velocity given to ions will be distributed among all\nmolecules present (ions, electrons and neutrals). A gas does\nnot need to be 100 % ionized in order to be efficiently\nguided and accelerated by electromagnetic forces.\n\nThese fundamental considerations explain why electric\nthrusters are capable of accelerating ions to speeds that are\nimpossible using chemical reactions, and that whilst they\nare capable of high specific impulses, their thrust comes\nnowhere near that of chemical rockets: because the pressure\nmust be very low, so is the momentum of the ionized gas\nbeing accelerated, and therefore the thrust.\n\nElectric thrusters (ET) where the accelerating force is\nCoulomb are called ion thrusters, and if the acceleration is\ndriven by differences in voltages applied to grids at the exit\nof the chamber, the thruster is often called a gridded ion\nengine (GIE). The jet of ions is also called an ion beam. The\nion beam is de facto a streamtube carrying a flow of ions,\nand thus is equivalent to a conductor carrying a current.\nCurrent is measured in ampere (coulombs per second), or\nmore practically, in mA with gridded ion engines. Ion\nthrusters operate at thousands of volts, but their current\ndensity (the ion flow rate) is small. As an example, an ion\ncurrent of 5 A is considered \u2018large\u2019.\n\nThe body of an ion thruster is light, consisting of a\nsimple cylinder, or a conical chamber, in which the ions are\nproduced at very low pressure. Their volume is large\ncompared to the thrust they can produce. Although rela-\ntively lightweight, they are cumbersome propulsion\nsystems.\n\nThrusters driven by the Lorentz force, or where a mag-\nnetic field holds some function, are of many types, and may\nbe grouped together under the name of magnetoplasmady-\nnamic (MPD) thrusters. MPD thrusters may have a self-\ngenerated magnetic field, that is, a magnetic field created by\nthe ion current, I, itself, or an externally applied magnetic\nfield; for instance, using permanent or electromagnets.\n\nApplied-field MPD thrusters generally need high current\n(thousands of A) and low voltage (10 or hundreds of V).\nOhmic losses, which scale with I2, are significant. The body\nof an applied-field MPD thruster is heavier than that of an ion\nthruster because conventional electromagnets require copper\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 301\n\n\n\ncoils. This may change over time as superconductor materials\nreplace copper, enabling the use of much smaller coils. Self-\nfield MPD thrusters may be non-stationary (pulsed), and if so,\nthey generally produce a low thrust. The thrust/unit volume\nmay be ten times higher than that of a GIE.\n\nAn important effect to be avoided in electric thrusters is\nthe charging of the engine itself during operation. For\ninstance, in a GIE positive ions are accelerated and ejected,\nthus the thruster itself charges negatively with time as\nelectrons accumulate in the engine. If electrons are not\nejected as well, the voltage of the thruster will rise until\narcing takes place between parts of the engine that are at\ndifferent voltages. To avoid this, the accelerated ion jet must\nbe neutralized: electrons must be conveyed and ejected\noutside the thruster towards the ion beam in order to make it\nelectrically neutral.\n\nCommon to all electric thrusters is a mechanism to\nionize the propellant. Gases such as O2, N2, H2, Ar, He, Xe,\nNe, have ionization energies of their atoms 13.6, 14.5, 13.6,\n15.75, 24.6, 12.1, 21.6, respectively. The ionization poten-\ntial of an alkali metal is lower, e.g. Li has 5.39 eV, Cs has\n3.89 eV, but to be practical these low ionization metals\nmust be stored as liquids, and then vaporized to serve as\npropellants. Note that ionization is not the only factor in\nchoosing a propellant, but the specifics of the ionization\nmechanism may determine the particular type of electric\nthruster. How the propellant is ionized characterizes dif-\nferent thrusters.\n\nIn arcjets (see Sect. 11.7) propellant is ionized by an arc\ndischarge. In a GIE, the ionization may be achieved by a\nradio-frequency (RF) voltage, by microwaves or by elec-\ntronic bombardment of the gas by electrons from a hollow\ncathode that spews electrons to the chassis (at a different\npotential from the cathode). MPD may use hollow cathodes,\nor RF heating.\n\nA power versus specific impulse map of electric thrusters\nis shown in Fig. 11.12, adapted from [3]. Note that the\nupper boundary of MPD thrusters could tend towards\n10 MW, and that ion thrusters could tend towards 15,000 s\nand have been run in the lab at 1 MW.\n\n11.5.1 Propellants\n\nChoice of propellant depends on the type of electric thrus-\nter. In GIE, where pressure must be kept low, to increase\nthrust the momentum of the propellant should be maxi-\nmized. Heavy molecular weight propellants are thus pre-\nferred. Note that this is exactly the opposite for\nthermochemical rockets, where thrust can be made as high\nas desired, and specific impulse is limited by temperature.\nArcjets excepted, in all types of electric thruster it is an\nexternal force that accelerates ions, not a thermodynamic\nexpansion, therefore higher molecular weight is convenient.\nThe molecular weight of the propellant should be the\nhighest that is compatible with operational and logistic\nrequirements. These dictate molecules that are gaseous (or\nliquid) at room temperature, are relatively easy to liquefy\nand store in tanks, are safe to handle, and hopefully not too\ncostly. For instance, mature GIE technology has xenon as\nthe propellant of choice. Xenon is not cheap (about\n4,000 US$/m3), but its atomic number, Z, is 54 and its\ndensity at standard temperature and pressure is about\n5.8 kg/m3. It is also inert and safe to handle. Its density\nwhen liquid (*3.1 g/cm3) means small tanks. Note that at\nsupercritical pressure its density is lower. Historically, the\nfirst propellants used for GIEs were mercury and caesium.\n\nIn arcjets the pressure need not to be as low as in a GIE\nor MPD thruster. Its thrust is produced by thermodynamic\nexpansion in a nozzle, as in a liquid rocket engine, and low\n\n0.1 \n\n1.0 \n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nR\neq\n\nu\nir\n\ned\n P\n\no\nw\n\ner\n,  k\n\nW\nSpecific Impulse, Isp\n\n100 500 1000 5000 10000\n\nNuclear powered transfers \n\nSolar powered transfers \n\nOrbit Manoeuvring/Adjustment \n\nStationkeeping / drag makeup \n\nResistojets \n\nArcjets \n\nPulsed Plasma Thrusters, PPT \n\nIon thrusters \n\nMagneto-Plasma \nDynamic, MPD \n\nHall Effect \nthrusters \n\nTending to 10MW\n\nTending to 1MW\nand 15000 s\n\nFig. 11.12 Approximate map of\npower and specific impulse\navailable with different electric\nthrusters, adapted from [3]. Note\nthe log\u2013log scale\n\n302 C. Bruno\n\n\n\nmolecular weight propellants like H2 have been used suc-\ncessfully. In MPD, acceleration is achieved by an external\n(Lorentz) force, but H2 has been used as a propellant\nbecause it can be ionized and accelerated to absorb much\nlarger power than other gases. The discovery that Li has no\nsecond ionization losses and (in association with Ba)\nreduces cathode erosion, has produced a significant\nimprovement in the performance of MPD thrusters.\nApplied-field MPD have also been tested with argon in\nEurope. The 200 kW VASIMR thruster that will run on\neither deuterium (D, or 2H), is due to be tested on the\nInternational Space Station (ISS) in the second half of the\n2010 decade, although using argon for safety.\n\nA common problem to all electric thrusters (but not to\nVASIMR) is electrode erosion and, more generally, mate-\nrial degradation when bombarded by ions and electrons.\nOther issues are engine bulk; power conditioning (e.g. GIE\nneed high voltage, and current is typically low; MPD need\njust the opposite, as do arcjets); electric power supply,\nrelying on solar panels that degrade with time due to solar\nand cosmic background radiation; efficiency, lower than\n50 % in certain thrusters; and heat waste disposal.\n\nThe electric thrusters that can be bought off the shelf are\nGIE and Hall thrusters. Most high power MPD are prom-\nising but still in the developmental stage.\n\n11.5.2 Power Supply\n\nElectric thrusters typically use solar power. In low-Earth\norbit, where the solar constant is 1,366 W/m2, the initial\nconversion efficiency is of the order of 24\u201328 %. The\nremainder is thermalized, and heats the panels. Heating and\nthe effect of solar proton flux degrades conversion\n\nefficiency. Future solar panels may have a higher efficiency\n(see Fig. 11.13) but their technology is still maturing.\n\nLarge voltages are possible by linking panels in series\n(e.g. for ion thrusters). Parallel connections in order to\nproduce the large currents needed by MPD thrusters, require\nmuch more wiring, which poses a weight issue that is\nindependent of the panel weight.\n\nDepending on the type of cell, the power to mass ratio\nmay vary between 40 W/kg for rigid panels and 140 W/kg\nfor blankets. Per unit area, the power varies between 100\nand 300 W/m2. A new technology uses solar concentrators\nover each cell, and may produce up to 290 W/m2, but also\nraises solar array mass. Further discussion of solar cells can\nbe found in Chap. 10.\n\nIt is apparent that for interplanetary exploration, and in\nparticular, for Mars missions, solar power may be an issue\nrather than a solution. This will depend on the mission\nduration, because crewed missions need fast interplanetary\ntransit in order to reduce the radiation dose to the crew, and\nalso because the solar flux available for power generation\ndecreases with the square of the distance from the Sun.\nThus, nuclear reactors will probably replace solar power for\ndeep space missions to the external planets.\n\n11.6 Electrostatic Propulsion\n\nElectric thrusters using Coulomb forces to accelerate posi-\ntively charged ions (ion thrusters) are in principle very\nsimple; they were envisaged by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky,\nexperimented with by Robert Goddard, and first tested by\nErnst Stuhlinger (1913\u20132008) at Peenemunde during WWII.\nHarold R. Kaufmann (born 1926) at NASA-Lewis (now\nGlenn) was the first to use high-energy electrons to ionize\n\nFig. 11.13 Evolution of solar\ncell best research-cell efficiency\nwith time.

The two\nfirst thrusters in space operation, SERT-I and -II were\nsuccessfully launched by NASA in 1964 and 1970. Their\nideal application was found in north/south station-keeping\nof geostationary satellites, where trajectory changes are\nminimal and the thrust required is very low. This notwith-\nstanding, the space industry is lukewarm to novelty, and\nonly in the 1990s did they become accepted as a satellite\npropulsion systems. More than 100 Xenon Ion Propulsion\nSystems (XIPS), originally manufactured by Hughes, then\nby Boeing, and now by L3-ETI, are in operation. In the\nhigher power class, NASA developed the NSTAR, which\nserved as the main propulsion thruster of the DeepSpace-1\n(DS1) and Dawn missions. Its thrust is about 92 mN but can\ndeliver a total DV of several km/s.\n\nA schematic of an ion thruster is given in Fig. 11.14.\nThis shows the conical chassis, a system of two grids at\ndifferent voltages used to accelerate ions, and a neutralizer.\nThe presence of the grids has given in the UK the name\ngridded ion engine (GIE) to this type of electric thruster.\nThe propellant (Xe is the most common) is ionized and a\nvoltage difference is applied between the two grids. The\nchassis is at a different voltage from the first grid (the\n\u2018screen\u2019 grid), in order to accelerate electrons emitted by the\nhollow cathode. It is the electron collisions with the pro-\npellant that are responsible for its ionization.\n\nThe ions that are formed are accelerated by the differ-\nence in voltage (*1 kV) between the screen grid and the\nsecond (\u2018accel\u2019) grid. The acceleration process of a partially\nionized gas in an electric field is quite different from that of\na single ion because positive charges repel each other, and\n\nthe thruster volume is filled with slow moving ions with a\nhigh charge density, thus substantially altering what would\nseem to be a straightforward task. In fact, the acceleration of\nions takes place between the grids, not between the chassis\nand the grid(s). The purpose of the screen grid is simply to\nextract slow ions from the positive plasma sheath upstream,\nso that they may be accelerated by the voltage difference\nwith the \u2018accel\u2019 grid. Guiding ions by means of voltages is\nsimilar to guiding light with lenses, and this fact has coined\nthe term \u2018ion optics\u2019. More efficient schemes using three or\nfour grids have been successfully demonstrated. Fig-\nure 11.15 shows the voltage scheme of the l-10 Japanese\nmicrowave-ionization thrusters installed on the Hayabusa\nprobe that sampled the Itokawa asteroid. This ion thruster\nused three-grid optics, with the chassis held at the same\nvoltage as the screen grid.\n\n11.6.1 Performance\n\nThe ideal zero-dimensional energy balance [4] predicts the\nion velocity U (the specific impulse of the thruster) in the\nacceleration region. If the mass of the ion of charge q is mq,\nthis balance states mq(U\n\n2/2) = qDV, where the right hand\nside is the work done by the Coulomb force on the charge\nq subject to the voltage difference DV = V - V0.

To produce a 1 N thrust requires\nabout 25\u201340 kW in the practical case, because the\n\npropellant is not 100 % ionized and losses (ionization,\nheating, and beam divergence, among others) raise the P/\nF ratio by a significant factor.\n\nIn space, electric power is typically gathered from solar\npanels. Even with gallium arsenide (GaAs) cells, the effi-\nciency is only about 30 %, and since the solar constant in\nLEO is about 1,366 W/m2 the solar panel surface grows\nrapidly with power. For instance, 10 kW needs about 25 m2.\nAnd recall that for deep space missions this number scales as\nthe inverse of the square of the distance to the Sun. Note that\nimproving the specific impulse lowers the propellant mass\nconsumption but raises the power; which is proportional to\nthe specific impulse cubed. Hence, each mission (character-\nized by payload, time, mass) must optimize the specific\nimpulse and the thrust and that increasing the specific\nimpulse is not the best strategy per se. For future deep space\nmissions that require higher thrust, nuclear reactors (see Sect.\n11.9) may power clusters of GIEs, freeing the spacecraft from\ndependence on solar power.\n\n11.6.3 Propellants\n\nThe fact that the thrust scales with\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\nmq=q\n? ?q\n\n, the inverse of\n\nthe specific impulse, implies a compromise in terms of the\npropellant molecular weight: everything being equal, hea-\nvier propellants (Hg, Xe, Cs) are better for thrust, but they\nwill reduce the specific impulse. Mercury (Hg, MW = 200)\nwas indeed the first propellant tested, but it has been\nabandoned due to its toxicity and the formation of amal-\ngams when in contact with metals. The propellant almost\nuniversally used nowadays is xenon (Xe, MW = 131),\nextracted from air and expensive at about 4,000 US$/m3.\nAmong the promising new propellants is bismuth (Bi,\nMW = 208), which must be vaporized but is non-corrosive.\nAs for the voltage, the main constraints are to limit the\npower consumption and to avoid arcing. A compromise\nmay be reached by having an initial grid to extract the ions,\nand then two grids, the first to accelerate, and the second, at\na reduced voltage with respect to the first, to decelerate to\nsome extent so that the net voltage will hold the power\nwithin the limitations of the solar panels.\n\n11.6.4 Ion Optics (Gridding)\n\nOlder gridded ion engines (GIE) had only two grids, and\ntheir nominal voltage difference of 1 kV was increased to\n5 kV to produce more thrust. However, such a high voltage\nresults in high screen grid erosion. The most efficient grid\narrangement thus far is four grids in two pairs. This method\nis based on the tokamak method of magnetic confinement.\n\nFig. 11.15 Schematic of the voltages applied to the three-grid l-10\nion thrusters of the Hayabusa probe that sampled the Itokawa asteroid\nand returned to Earth in 2006\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 305\n\n\n\nThe first grid pair extracts ions by means of a moderate\nvoltage of *3 kV, with the first grid having a much larger\nopen area ratio than the others. This eases the task of\nextracting and collimating the ions into a parallel beam. The\naccel grid potential is applied between the second and the\nthird grids, separated by a wider gap. A negative potential\nbetween the third and the final fourth grid decelerates the\nbeam, but also reduces the total power consumption.\n\nAfter the beam leaves the thruster, it must be neutralized,\notherwise the thruster and the spacecraft would be charged\nnegatively by leftover electrons. The neutralizer \u2018recycles\u2019\nelectrons by injecting them into the ion beam outside the\nspacecraft, and closes the electric circuit. Injecting the\nelectrons is typically done using a hollow cathode.\n\nGIE are used for north/south station-keeping in geosta-\ntionary satellites, but are also available for interplanetary\nprobes. As their thrust is small, missions using GIEs have\nlifetimes of many years or even a decade. Thus, structural\nissues, not only electronics and electric issues are important.\nAmong the structural issue associated with the grid, the\nmost important are rigidity and erosion resistance. Grid\nspacing is of the order of 1 mm and there cannot be struts to\nstiffen the pairs of grids: these are rim held, and thus must\nbe extremely rigid. This issue has limited the maximum\ndiameter of a GIE to about 40\u201350 cm. Erosion due to ion\nimpingement on the grid lattice, is addressed by the use of\nhigh Young\u2019s modulus and refractory metals. Beryllium\n(Be) and molybdenum (Mo) have been used successfully.\nCarbon\u2013carbon grids are an emerging technology because\nof their extreme rigidity, but are more prone to arcing due to\nprotruding fibers in the holes. The issue of erosion is\nimportant in view of the required lifetimes of many years.\nSome performance data of GIEs are in Table 11.6.\n\n11.6.5 Types of Gridded Ion Engine\n\nBesides the gridding, ion thrusters are classified by their\nionization technique. Kaufman\u2019s GIE ionizes the propellant\nby bombarding it with electrons emitted by a hollow\n\ncathode and directed towards an anode. Radio-frequency\nionization does not need electrodes. It is produced by a\nperiodic magnetic field that is excited by a coil powered by\nalternating current at a frequency of 103\u2013104 Hz. These are\ncalled radio-frequency ion thrusters (RIT). The propellant\nmay also be ionized by microwave heating. This technique\ndoes not require electrodes either. A detailed description of\nion thrusters is given in [5].\n\nIon thrusters tend to be reliable propulsion systems, but\ntheir thrust/unit volume is low compared to the Hall and\nMPD thrusters described in Sect. 11.8. Their thrust depends\non power, and solar panels will probably be insufficient for\ncertain classes of missions for example when the spent in\nspace must be strictly limited due to radiation risks to a\ncrew.\n\nGIE technology has matured to the point of being\ncommercial (e.g. the XIPS family of thrusters developed by\nHughes), and is still evolving. The HiPEP thruster devel-\noped with NASA funding has demonstrated a specific\nimpulse of about 19,000 s in the laboratory, at the price of a\nshortened life. The four-grid ion optic evolution has just\nstarted: ESA and the Australian National University tested\nthe four-grid ion engine demonstrator DS4G in the labora-\ntory, achieving a specific impulse of 210 km/s (about\n21,000 s). Increasing the specific impulse depends on the\naccelerating voltage, Vacc, and there seems to be no con-\nceptual obstacle to achieving specific impulses of the order\n30,000\u201350,000 s, and even 100,000 s with the help of a\ntokamak or other magnetic confinement technique. At the\nsame time, the electrical power, which scales with the cube\nof the specific impulse, will likely require a nuclear source.\n\n11.7 Electrothermal Propulsion\n\nElectrothermal propulsion was, in practice, one of the first\nattempts at electric propulsion. The principle is simply to\nconvert electric power from, say, solar panels, into heat by\nusing ohmic losses (resistivity losses), proportional to I2R,\nwith I being the current and R the resistance of the circuit.\n\nTable 11.6 A range of some flown or space qualified gridded ion thrusters.

Bruno\n\n\n\nThe energy released heats a propellant which is expanded in\na conventional nozzle to produce thrust. This class of pro-\npulsion systems is called a resistojet. For instance, a 30 kW\nhydrogen resistojet can produce 6 N thrust at a specific\nimpulse of about 860 s. Overall, the efficiency is of the\norder of 70 %. However, because hydrogen must be\nactively cooled for it to be space storable for periods of\nseveral weeks, other propellants must be used if a resistojet\nis to be used over longer periods, with an inevitable loss of\nspecific impulse. The mass/power ratio of resistojets is\nmuch larger than for any chemical system.\n\nArcjets are a particular class of resistojet, where the\nconductor that dissipates electric power into heat is the\nplasma arc between the cathode tip and the anode, which\ntypically consists of the conical nozzle itself. Thrust is\nproduced by the expansion of the propellant gas, which is\nheated by the arc plasma as it flows coaxially to the cathode\nand through a throat, as sketched in Fig. 11.16.\n\nThe arc plasma may be stable (\u2018anchor\u2019) even at a\npressure of order 1 bar, and that sets arcjets apart from other\nelectric thrusters, where the pressure must be much lower in\norder to prevent the ions and electrons from recombining.\nThus, the most attractive feature of arcjets is their ability to\nwork at significantly higher pressure than other thrusters,\nand to produce much higher thrust. In fact, the thrust per\nunit exit area may be several thousand N/m2, an order of\nmagnitude higher than for current gridded ion engines.\n\nAs in all types of arc, the voltage is in the tens of volts,\nwith a current that may reach 1,000 A. The longer the arc,\nthe more power is converted into heat, so the arc should\nattach itself in the anodic diverging part of the nozzle and\nbe spread as much as possible (not be attached to a single\npoint), forming what is called a \u2018spoke\u2019. When this can be\nrealized, the arc attachment is said to be diffused. Although\nthis desirable feature cannot be predictably controlled,\nincreasing the propellant flow rate, _m, generally forces the\nattachment point to move downstream, with a desirable\nincrease of current and power. Unlike chemical rockets, in\nrecent arcjet designs the throat of the arc is shaped more\n\nlike a long duct with a constant cross-section. This constant\ncross-section duct is the \u2018constrictor\u2019 that forces more heat\nto be transferred from the arc plasma to the co-flowing\npropellant. In doing so, the voltage drop may be further\nincreased and so may the power and the thrust. A second\nreason for the shape of the constrictor is the impossibility of\npredicting the exact position of the sonic throat, as the flow\ntemperature increases from the cathode to the anode. Arcjet\npower is limited by the amount of energy that the arc can\ntransfer to the propellant. This depends on the length of the\narc, and therefore on its total resistance and voltage drop:\nthe larger the drop, the larger is the power that is dissipated\nin the arc and transferred to the propellant, and the larger is\nthe thrust. However, a constrictor with an excessive length\nto diameter ratio (L/D) also transfers more heat to the walls.\nThe L/D ratio of the constrictor is therefore a compromise\nbetween these two effects.\n\nLike a chemical rocket, the thrust and specific impulse of\nan arcject scales with the ratio between temperature and the\nmolecular weight (MW) of the gas propellant; i.e. on theffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\nT=MW\np\n\nfactor. However, unlike a chemical rocket, no\nsimple analytical relationship exists. It is experimentally\nknown that the thrust scales with the electric power and\ninversely with the specific impulse (or exhaust velocity, ve).\nA heuristic relationship defining the thrust efficiency, g, is\nthe thrust power divided by the electric power\n\ng \u00bc 1\n2\n\n_mv2e\nP\n\u00bc ve\n\nF\n\n2P\n\u00f011:28\u00de\n\nshowing that the thrust scales with the power via the effi-\nciency, g, which is a quantity that must be experimentally\ndetermined. This efficiency depends on the geometry and\narchitecture of the arcjet, and cannot typically be modeled\nwith sufficient accuracy because the arcjet dissipates a large\nfraction (sometimes most) of the input electric power. The\ntwo main dissipation mechanisms are dissociation losses in\nthe nozzle due to radical species that do not recombine in\nthe nozzle and are ejected carrying their dissociation\n\nValve \n\nPressurized \nFuel Gas \n\nChamber \n\nCathode \n\nNozzle \n\nArc between cathode \ntip and annular \nregion of anode \n\n+ \n\nElectric power from \nLow voltage, high \n\ncurrent source \n\nAnnular anode \n\nHigh temperature \nradiation \n\nFig. 11.16 Schematic of an\narcjet.

An additional loss is ohmic heating of the electric\ncircuit the feeds the thruster.\n\n11.7.1 Dissociation Losses\n\nThese depend on the propellant gas, the operational\nparameters, and on the flow path through the thruster to the\nnozzle. Since arcjets are thermodynamic systems, to obtain\na reasonably high specific impulse requires low molecular\nweight propellants. Thus, liquid or gaseous hydrides, for\ninstance hydrogen (H2), ammonia (NH3), or hydrazine\n(N2H4), are preferred propellants, but helium and argon are\nalso used. Molecular propellants however, dissociate\npromptly in the arc, forming many radical species such as\nNH, N, H and others, some of which are also vibrationally\nand electronically excited. As in a liquid rocket engine,\nthese radicals recombine slowly in the divergent, and those\nthat have no time to recombine represent a net energy loss\nthat lowers the thrust and the specific impulse. At a specific\nimpulse of the order of 2,000 s the bulk velocity is about g0\ntimes greater, at about 20 km/s. A nozzle diameter of the\norder of 0.5 m means a residence time of less than 1 ms,\nwhich is insufficient to recombine or neutralize all of the\nnitrogen, hydrogen or argon ions. In addition, the high\ntemperature of the exhaust in the nozzle means a low\ndensity and a high viscosity. That is, along the nozzle the\nReynolds number (Re) tends to decrease, and the radial\nvelocity profile tends toward a distribution which resembles\nthat of a laminar regime. An arcjet nozzle with an exit\ndiameter of 10 cm and an area ratio of 100 may have an exit\nRe of the order of 100. Viscous effects dissipate much of the\nkinetic energy, and the expected performance does not\nfollow the simple relationships in Sect. 11.2.\n\nNote that, among the hydride propellants, hydrazine may\nalso work as a monopropellant in the case of an electric\nmalfunction of the arcjet. To this purpose, the propellant\nfeed system must allow hydrazine to bypass the arcjet inlet\nand reach the hydrazine catalytic bed because hydrazine\ndoes not decompose spontaneously (see Sect. 11.3).\n\n11.7.2 Radiative Losses\n\nRadiative losses depend on how much of the arc heat is\ntransferred to the walls, and hence to the external surface.\nUsing the propellant itself as the coolant (regenerative\ncooling) recovers part of the heat loss, but the low specific\nheat capacity at constant pressure of common arcjet propel-\nlants cannot absorb much heat. There is an alternative\nadvantage in regenerative cooling, and that is the increased\npressure of the propellant injected in the arc chamber, which\n\nincreases the discharge voltage and the arc power. Data from\n[6] show that the simple radiatively cooled and the regener-\natively cooled versions of the HIPARC arcjet tested at the\nUniversity of Stuttgart had maximum efficiencies of about 30\nand 37 %, respectively; in the second case that was found to\ndepend also on the operational specific impulse, in fact\nfalling with increasing specific impulse.\n\n11.7.3 Technology\n\nThe major issues in arcjets are cathode and anode erosion,\nrecombination losses, and power requirements.\n\nErosion is a common issue for all electric thrusters where\nionization of the propellant is obtained using a thermal\nmechanism. Current must flow from the cathode to the\nanode by an applied voltage difference, which means that\nelectrons extracted from the cathode will impact the anode.\nIons will follow the opposite path. The extraction and\nimpact are equivalent to energetically bombarding the\nelectrode surface. Electrode surfaces may be damaged not\nonly over the lifetime of the thruster, but also by a single\nimproper ramping up of voltage and current during the\nstartup of the arc, when the cathode is cold. The energy of\nthe ions and electrons may be gauged from the voltage of\nthe arc to be of the order of tens of eV, where 1 eV cor-\nresponds to 11,300 K in terms of temperature.\n\n11.7.4 Power\n\nHigh-thrust arcjets need substantial electric power. For\ninstance, the ideal kinetic power, 12 Fve, to produce a thrust\nof 1 N is of the order of 10 kW, but that must be doubled or\ntrebled to account for all losses. Because arcs work at\n10\u2013100 V, the current is typically of the order of thousands\nof A. Large amperage implies large ohmic (I2R) losses that\nwould be intolerable in space operation. To reduce them,\nthe copper wiring must be massive. Future high-temperature\nsuperconducting wires, capable of remaining superconduc-\ntive at liquid nitrogen temperature, may offer a solution to\nthis problem, but their flight heritage, although flown on-\nboard the TECHSAT II in 1998, is limited.\n\n11.7.5 Performance\n\nArcjets at 100 kW are capable of thrusts of the order of\n1\u20135 N, and specific impulses that vary between 1,000 and\n2,000 s. In general, the specific impulse grows with the\nthermal load of the arcjet, but the efficiency is typically less\nthan 50 %.\n\n308 C. Bruno\n\n\n\n11.7.5.1 Materials Technology\nThe arc plasma temperature may vary locally from 15,000\nto 25,000 K, and the arcjet body, although shielded by\npropellant, must withstand temperatures of 1,000 K and\nhigher. Thus, the best body materials are refractory alloys or\nceramics such as boron nitride (BN, melting point 3,246 K),\ntungsten (W, melting point 3,410 ?C), hafnium oxide\n(HfO2, melting point 2,758 ?C) and others, all of which are\ncostly and expensive to work with. The choice of material\ndepends also on the electric properties and electronic\nextraction work (the \u2018work function\u2019 is *4\u20135 eV for met-\nals). In order for electrons to be steadily emitted from the tip\nof the cathode, this requires the cathode tip temperature to\nbe maintained at over 2,000 K. This requirement is not\nsatisfied at startup, and if the voltage ramping is not right\nthe cathode may locally melt, resulting in fast erosion,\npitting, and unstable operation. Chemical attack may also\nstart if the propellant contains oxidizing impurities,\nincluding water or its traces. There is no standard remedy\nfor this malfunction, except to size the cathode so that its\nsurface area is large enough to distribute the heat flux\nevenly, and to choose a \u2018good\u2019 refractory material. To\nreduce the electronic extraction work, electrodes are fre-\nquently made with a dispersion of thorium oxide (\u2018thoriat-\ned\u2019 electrodes), but this adds to the manufacturing cost.\n\nIn-space cooling of arcjets is typically by radiation,\nwhich carries an efficiency penalty. Regenerative cooling\nincreases efficiency, as noted, but adds to the material\nmanufacturing cost because channels to extract heat from\nthe arcjet body and preheat the propellant must be milled,\nand refractory materials are notoriously very hard and more\nfragile than metals, making them more difficult to work\nwith.\n\n11.7.5.2 Testing\nThis is a serious issue for high-power arcjets (in the hun-\ndreds of kW). In practice this requires a dedicated power\nstation attached to the laboratory, complemented by a\npower conditioning unit to transform AC current from the\nhigh voltage grid to the low DC voltage required by the arc.\nThis adds further to the cost and complication of testing a\nhigh power arcjet: in fact, simulating arcjet performance in\nthe vacuum of space needs a vacuum tank and significant\npumping power, since the specific impulse is of the order of\n2,000 s at most, and the mass flow rate is at least 1 g/s. Not\nmany facilities exist worldwide that are capable of this\nperformance; one is at NASA-JPL and it is actually capable\nof handling several MW of power.\n\nIn conclusion, arcjets are a class of thruster that is\ncapable of producing a thrust of several newtons, which is\nmuch higher than most electric thrusters. They are also\ncompact and relatively uncomplicated. Their disadvantages\nare that the specific impulse is typically limited to\n\n1,200\u20131,800 s, and the low efficiency raises thermal issues\nin disposing of the waste heat. These disadvantages weigh\nheavily on the evolution of high-power arcjets. Conse-\nquently, at this time they are not in common usage in space.\nThey could perhaps enjoy a second life when space nuclear\npower becomes available.\n\n11.8 Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters\n\nMagnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters work by acceler-\nating ionized matter by the Lorentz force, F \u00bc J? B, where\nJ is the current flux (coulombs per unit area and per unit\ntime, or A/m2) produced by ion movement, and B is the\nmagnetic induction vector (in tesla, T). The vector product\nimplies that the force applied to the ion stream is normal to\nthe plane in which J and B lie. Thus, for the Lorentz force\nto exist, a current (ionized gas, for instance) must pass\nbetween an anode and a cathode, and there must exist an\nelectric field and a voltage driving the current. Once the\nions move, driven by this voltage, the Lorentz force of the\nmagnetic field B will accelerate the ions. The reaction\n(thrust) is the Lorentz force applied to the circuitry neces-\nsary to maintain the voltage and the magnetic field.\n\nUnlike a chemical thruster, where the thrust direction is\nfixed by the nozzle axis, the thrust of an MPD thruster\ndepend on the particular configuration of the electric and\nmagnetic fields, and of their electric circuitry. There may\nalso be transients, e.g. a magnetic field can be generated by\nthe current flowing instantaneously between electrodes. The\nelectric and magnetic fields are degrees of freedom in\nconceptually designing an MPD thruster. There is no gen-\neral theory of MPD thrusters: their performance (thrust and\nspecific impulse) cannot be estimated based on knowledge\nof, say, the applied voltage and magnetic field. In fact, in\npulsed thrusters, no magnetic field is applied, it is created by\nthe current driven by an instantaneous voltage. Although\nthrusters are often specified in terms of electric power, that\nis the energy consumed, not the thrust delivered.\n\nThe simplest MPD thruster is shown in Fig. 11.17. A\nspark vaporizes and ionizes a minute amount of propellant,\nhere Teflon, fed to the ionization chamber by a loaded\nspring. Ionized Teflon products driven by the voltage form\nan instantaneous current, I, between the electrodes. This\ncurrent produces a magnetic field B normal to the plane of\nthe figure. B is also normal to I, and the J? B Lorentz force\non the Teflon plasma accelerates it from left to right. When\nthe plasma slug is ejected, the thruster stops, and a new\nspark must resume the process. This MPD thruster is called\na pulsed plasma thruster (PPT), and it can be practically\nrealized in many ways. For instance, Fig. 11.18 shows an\naxisymmetric PPT in which the current itself creates the\nmagnetic field whose azimuthal component, Bh, is normal to\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 309\n\n\n\nthe current in most of the nozzle and server to accelerate the\nplasma.\n\nThe instantaneous magnetic field created by a pulsed\nthruster may be large, but the current depends on the\nquantity of material that is ablated and ionized to form the\ncurrent. Most PPTs are small, e.g. in the hundreds of lN to\na few mN range, but their specific impulses may reach\n2,000 s, although with a low efficiency of perhaps 10 %. A\ncharacteristic quantity is the impulse bit, the product of\nthrust times time. Small PPTs for satellite attitude control\ncan produce impulse bits (Ns) in the range 100\u20131,000 lNs,\nconsuming several tens of Watts. A micro-PPT built at the\nUniversity of Washington, powered by 12.5 W from solar\npanels, had a maximum impulsive thrust of 0.14 mN, a\nspecific impulse of 500 s, and an impulse bit of 70 lNs; the\nenergy consumption/DV was 1.4 9 105 J/(m/s) for a total\nmass of 3.8 kg. PPTs are used on microsatellites because,\nalthough not very efficient, they are simple, reliable, easy to\n\noperate, and with solid propellant can last for many years\nwithout maintenance.\n\nPPTs are normally self-field MPD thrusters, i.e. they\ngenerate the magnetic field B with their own current. Self-\nfield thrusters may also produce continuous thrust. A second\nclass has the magnetic field applied externally, and this is\nthe technology of choice for producing much higher con-\ntinuous or quasi-continuous thrust. The simplest of these is\nthe Faraday thruster, or Lorentz Force Accelerator (LFA).\nConceptually, it consists of a square channel with walls that\nare insulated from each other. Applying a voltage of several\nhundred V between two parallel walls creates an electric\nfield, E, and ionized propellant driven by the electric field\nestablishes a current between the two walls. If the power\navailable is in the hudreds of kW, then the current may be of\norder 1\u201310 kA. The applied magnetic field can be created\neither by permanent magnets or by electromagnets, the two\npoles formed by the pair of parallel walls. In principle, this\n\nFig. 11.17 Schematic of a\npulsed plasma thruster. Image U.\nWalach\n\nFig. 11.18 Schematic of an\naxisymmetric pulsed plasma\nthruster.

Bruno\n\n\n\narrangement maximizes the Lorentz force accelerating the\nplasma, since J and B are at right angles to each other.\nThrusters may be axisymmetric, except that a solenoid\nshould be imagined wound around the divergent (conical)\nnozzle. The solenoid creates an additional B field that helps\nto raise the Lorentz force and to stabilize the plasma. Such\nan MPD thruster and nozzle arrangement is shown in\nFig. 11.19. This simple description belies the technological\ndifficulties of handling large currents. With xenon (Xe) and\nargon (Ar) gases the efficiency is 20 % at most, but lithium\n(Li) and dihydrogen (H2) it can be as much as 50 %.\nOverheating and erosion of the electrodes (especially the\ncathode) is common. MPD thrusters are capable of\nabsorbing power in the MW range, but their low efficiency\nrequires the unused power to be radiated away to space,\neither directly from the engine or, less preferably, through a\nspace radiator.\n\nAxisymmetric self-field and steady MPD thrusters\nresemble arcjets, except their power may be much higher.\nSteady MPD thrusters tested in Russia at the Moscow\nAviation Institute have been operated at 188 kW, producing\nspecific impulses of the order of 4,500 s with 49 % effi-\nciency. A 250 kW and a 500 kW radiatively cooled MPD\nwere designed and lab tested at NASA-JPL with an effi-\nciency about 60 % and specific impulses of 4,500 and\n6,200 s, respectively. In general, such power levels are hard\nto test in the laboratory; space operation at power over\n1 MW becomes impractical with solar panels and requires\nnuclear power. Experience with MPD thrusters in the 1-\nMW class shows that lifetime is inversely correlated to\ncurrent. Using lithium propellant and adding a small per-\ncentage of barium (Ba) increased the lifetime from 8,800 h\nat 10 kA to 28,000 h at 2.75 kA. Thrust and specific\nimpulse depend on the combination of power and propel-\nlant. Lithium (with barium additive) yields a maximum\npower 1\u20135 MW, with a thrust of the order of 1\u20132 N/MW\nand a specific impulse of 4,000\u20136,000 s. Above 5 MW only\n\nhydrogen can absorb the voltage drop and power at an\nefficiency [60 %, and the specific impulse may rise to\n10,000\u201315,000 s because of the low molecular weight.\nObtaining sustained performance at this level requires long-\nlife cathodes, for instance perforated and internally cooled,\nand a high emissivity coating such as zirconium diboride\n(ZrB2).\n\nThe trend toward powers of many MW depends on the\nfact that in most designs the efficiency increases with the\npower. Several pulsed MPD thrusters have been designed\n(but not tested) that are capable of absorbing a few MW.\nHowever, their efficiency is still below 50\u201360 %, not only\nbecause of ionization losses but also because the ion current\nejected (i.e. the ion beam) is not collimated well. In fact, to\nimprove the thrust direction, the applied field must be made\ninto a true magnetic nozzle. Alternatively, the geometry\nshould be that of an LFA. The thrust density and power/\nvolume of multi-MW MPD thrusters are about an order of\nmagnitude higher than with gridded ion engines. Once the\nerosion problem is solved, MPD systems may become\ncompetitive for space missions.\n\n11.8.1 Hall Thrusters\n\nHall thrusters were first developed in the former Soviet\nUnion in the 1960s by the Fakel design bureau, and their\ntechnology has been exported to France and to the US.\nMore than a hundred Hall thrusters have been space flown\nby the Soviet Union and Russia in the past 40 years.\n\nThe principle of the Hall thruster is shown in Fig. 11.20.\nIt is based on the difference in mass between ions and\nelectrons in a magnetic field, which determines the order of\nmagnitude differences in gyration radii and frequencies.\nElectrons extracted from an external cathode move toward\nthe internal anode, are captured by an applied radial mag-\nnetic field, B, and drift in the channel, hence the technical\n\nFig. 11.19 An MPD thruster\nwith a magnetic nozzle. Image\ncredit the High-Power Electric\nPropulsion Laboratory (HPEPL)\nin the Georgia Institute of\nTechnology Department of\nAerospace Engineering\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 311\n\n\n\nname of closed electron drift thrusters. Propellant (xenon,\nXe) is injected, collides with electrons and ionizes, and the\nions move along the electric field, E, created by the voltage\ndrop in the magnetized plasma.\n\nIn a magnetized plasma, the resistivity perpendicular to\nthe magnetic field lines is much higher than along the lines.\nTherefore, the electrostatic field is perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field lines. The ions do not recombine with elec-\ntrons because their momentum is approximately 104 times\nlarger than that of the electrons, and they are accelerated\nout. This produces a thrust in the 0.1\u20131 N range, with the\nlatter having been demonstrated in experiments but not yet\nflown. The efficiency is about 50\u201360 % and the specific\nimpulse is 1,500\u20133,000 s. The discharge voltage is from\nhundreds of V to 1 kV. The power of the Hall thrusters\nflown so far is in the 10 kW range, and their erosion is\nlower than for self-field or applied-field MPD thrusters. The\nPPS?1350 thruster has been qualified at 10,500 h, which is\nsufficient for some interplanetary missions, and it was used\non the ESA SMART-1 probe that spiraled out to the Moon\nand entered orbit there.\n\n11.8.2 VASIMR Thruster\n\nThe VASIMR (Variable Specific Impulse Magnetic Rocket)\nthruster, developed initially by Franklin Chang-D\u00edaz (born\n1950), at NASA, and now by the Ad Astra Company in\nTexas and Costa Rica, differs from other MPD thrusters in\nits ionization strategy and thrust control. The ionization is\nachieved by radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves of\n103\u2013104 Hz, as in tokamak magnetic confinement technol-\nogy. A helicon antenna broadcasts RF energy to the\n\npropellant molecules, increasing their internal energy\ndegrees of freedom, as a preliminary to ionizing them via\ncollisions. This strategy eschews electrodes entirely, and\nthus the erosion problems that limit all other electric\nthrusters. The second stage of VASIMR uses RF matching\nthe ion cyclotron frequency to further increase the energy of\nthe ions. Before the ions can redistribute their translational\nenergy into vibration and rotational degrees of freedom, a\nmagnetic nozzle ejects them. Thus the magnetic field, B, in\nVASIMR plays the key role in the ion acceleration process,\nsee Fig. 11.21. The magnetic field also plays a key role in\npreventing the extremely energetic plasma from melting the\nthruster wall, because it traps ions within its lines of force.\nAs the magnetic field controls ionization and acceleration,\nVASIMR should be able to vary its thrust against specific\nimpulse on-demand, for instance using a high thrust and a\nlow specific impulse when spiraling out from LEO, and\nincreasing specific impulse and lowering the thrust when\ntraveling along a interplanetary trajectory.\n\nVASIMR prototypes are labeled with their VF-number,\nindicating the power in kW. Their thrust efficiency has\ngrown from 40 % for VX-50 to an estimated 50 % for VF-\n200, which is due to be tested on the International Space\nStation (ISS) post-2015. The power that does not contribute\nto kinetic energy ends up as heat that must be disposed of in\nsome way, for instance by radiation. The magnetic field to\noperate VASIMR is of the order of 1\u20132 T, which requires\ncooling conventional electromagnets, or cryocooling of\nsuperconductive solenoids. Since VF-50 was capable of\n0.5 N, assuming 50 % efficiency and specific impulse of\n5,000 s, the thrust of the VF-200 should be about 2 N. VF-\n200 will be tested in an experiment where it will tempo-\nrarily replace the conventional MMH/NTO thrusters that\nare normally used to reboost the ISS orbit, which is con-\nstantly decaying due to atmospheric drag.\n\n11.8.3 Propellants and\nMagnetoplasmadynamic Life\n\nThe technology of MPD thrusters is not as well established\nas that of ion (electrostatic) thrusters, although trends in\nterms of power, propellant and materials are beginning to be\nunderstood. Xenon, argon, H2 and its isotopes, and recently\nlithium and barium, have all been tested. The light elements\n(H2, He and Li) give the best specific impulse performance\nfor applied-field MPD, but H2 and other gases erode the\nelectrodes. As ionization losses are important, and it is\nrecognized that the heavy molecules that are traditionally\nfavored as propellants (Xe, Ar) may dissipate part of the\ninput power in ionizing the L-shell because the second\nionization potential is higher than the first. In fact, lithium\nhas a second ionization potential that is so high as to be\n\nFig. 11.20 Schematic cross-section of a radially-symmetric Hall\neffect thruster. Electrons emitted by the cathode are trapped by the\nmagnetic field, and act as a virtual cathode. Ions, created by the\ncollision of neutral propellant with electron are accelerated from the\nanode to the virtual cathode, acquiring momentum that prevents them\nfrom recombining with electrons. The electrons emitted by the\nexternal cathode neutralize the ion beam. Image Finlay McWalter\n\n312 C. Bruno\n\n\n\n\u2018inaccessible\u2019, and this reduces losses. The performance of\nsteady MPD thrusters varies with the current, the applied\nmagnetic field, and the size. Thrusts up to several newtons\nand specific impulses up to 5,000 s have been obtained in\nthe laboratory with light propellants (Li and H2 or D2) at\nefficiencies up to 50 %. Heavier gases like Xe and Ar\nproduce specific impulses near 2,500 s. The erosion of\nelectrodes with most gaseous propellants limits the life of\nall MPD thrusters, but lithium propellant seems to improve\nthe electrode lifetime considerably, and especially when\nbarium vapor is also present. The power that can be\nabsorbed by an MPD thruster depends on the ionization\nlosses and on the terminal voltage drop. It also depends on\nthe propellant. Lithium propellant can work up to a drop of\nseveral hundreds of volts, in practice limiting the power to\nseveral MW because currents above 4\u20135 kA erode the\ncathode too rapidly. To absorb more power a voltage drop\nof many hundreds of V is required, and because hydrogen\nand its isotopes can do it this is the most likely propellant of\nchoice for future thrusters in the tens of MW. An additional\nbenefit of hydrogen is its specific impulse, which should rise\nabove 10,000 s.\n\nThe lifetimes of MPD thrusters can typically be mea-\nsured in weeks of operation, which is inadequate for\n\ninterplanetary missions where their relatively high thrust\nwould be very useful. Hall thrusters have a life of the order\nof many months to a year, but their specific impulse is at\nmost 1,500\u20133,000 s. VASIMR works best with hydrogen\nand deuterium and, being electrode-less, should in principle\nbe capable of a much longer life than gridded ion engines\nand MPD thrusters. Cathode technology using refractory\nmaterials, active cooling, and high thermal emissivity\ncoatings, is progressing and may make future MPDs,\npowered by nuclear reactors, the propulsion technology of\nchoice for crewed missions.\n\n11.9 Advanced Propulsion\n\nAdvanced propulsion includes many innovative and con-\nceptual systems that do not fall within the conventional\ncategories. For instance, nuclear propulsion (all types, such\nas fission, fusion, and matter\u2013antimatter annihilation);\ninterstellar ramjets; beamed energy propulsion; solar and\nmagnetic sails that use the photons and protons emitted by\nthe Sun; and even more exotic systems that are based on\ngeneral relativity and quantum mechanics, such as space-\nwarping and zero-point energy.\n\nFig. 11.21 Principle of\noperation of the VF-200\nVASIMR prototype showing the\ndiverging ion trajectories at the\nnozzle exit (top), and schematic\nVASIMR layout (bottom). Image\nAd Astra Corporation\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 313\n\n\n\nMost of these are either just concepts, or they have been\nproven to be realizable only in the very far future; as for\ninstance, fusion propulsion. Some have been proved to be\nimpractical engineering-wise, such as beamed energy for\ninterplanetary travel, or flawed in the sense they violate\ncurrently understood fundamental physics, like interstellar\nramjets. Among those that have been at least ground-tested,\nthere is nuclear propulsion, an old technology born after\nWWII, and solar sails, which have being actively pursued\nby several space agencies since the 1960s and recently\ndemonstrated in space.\n\n11.9.1 Nuclear Propulsion\n\nWhy nuclear propulsion? The scaling of specific impulse,\nthrust, and power offers the answer.\n\u2022 Specific impulse and the propellants mass flow rate, _m,\n\nscale with the exhaust velocity, ve, and the specific\nimpulse controls the total mass consumed.\n\n\u2022 Thrust, F, scales with the mass flow rate, _m, times the\nexhaust velocity, ve, and hence with ve\n\n2 it controls the\nmission duration.\n\n\u2022 Power is the kinetic energy per unit time ejected, or 12 _mv\n2\ne .\n\nIt scales with ve\n3, and is the price to pay.\n\nDue to the radiation doses to any crew, deep space\nmissions must be faster than can be achieved using chem-\nical propulsion. Thrust must be applied for much longer\nthan the few minutes of a chemical rocket. The energy\nconsumed will be far greater than that available using\nchemistry. For instance, a thrust of 1 N by a future ion\nengine with specific impulse 10,000 s needs 0.1 GW, and\nsince the thrust is only 1 N, this power will have to be\nmaintained for a long time. The potential energy that must\nbe available to do that depends on the fundamental forces of\nphysics, see Table 11.1.\n\nThe ideal energy balance, energy density equals 12 v\n2\ne\n\nshows that the exhaust velocity, ve, equals the square-root of\ntwice the energy density. To increase the thrust and reduce\nthe travel time the exhaust velocity must be made as large\nas possible. Note that by doing so the mass consumption\ndecreases but the price is a dramatically increased by the\non-board power that must be available.\n\nTable 11.1 shows that the nuclear force is the only one\nthat can meet the challenge posed by future missions, in\nparticular human missions to Mars, the asteroids, or the icy\nmoons of Jupiter. Any other \u2018slower\u2019 solution, including\nsolar, appears unfeasible in view of the fact that the radi-\nation dose outside the van Allen belts is in the Sievert\nrange for a 1-year mission (a yearly dose on Earth is\n0.6\u20132.4 mSv, depending on location). It is generally agreed\nthat human missions to even the closest planets must be\n\nfast (3\u20134 months, at most) and that only nuclear propulsion\ncan provide the required energy [7].\n\nThe main strategies to exploit nuclear energy are ther-\nmal, electric, and a combination of the two.\n\n11.9.1.1 Nuclear Thermal Propulsion\nNuclear propulsion (NP) was originally proposed at the end\nof WWII in the UK, in the wake of the atomic bomb tests.\nThe US Department of Defense (DoD) started investigating\nnuclear propulsion for the second stage of the Atlas inter-\ncontinental continental ballistic missile (ICBM) under the\nRover project. After the Atlas problems were solved,\nROVER became NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket\nVehicle Application), and the application was space flight.\nThe Soviet Union\u2019s history of nuclear propulsion remains\nunclear; however, it very likely followed a technology path\nsimilar to that in the US.\n\nNuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) involves the use of\ncompact nuclear reactors (NR). The fission of the uranium-\n235 (235U) isotopes releases fission fragments, neutrons, and\ngamma rays which by colliding with nuclei of uranium and\nothers species, convert (\u2018thermalize\u2019) their kinetic energy\ninto heat. The kinetic energy is up to 200 MeV for fission\nfragments, and 10 MeV for neutrons and gamma rays. By\nmeans of cooling channels manufactured inside the fuel\nbars, this heat is transferred to the coolant (LH2), which is\ngasified by the heat and is expanded in a conventional\nnozzle. This type of reactor, where the fuel is contained\ninside replaceable bars, is called a solid-core nuclear reac-\ntor. Other core concepts include liquid and gas-core reac-\ntors, and these were investigated at the Kurchatov Institute\nin Russia and at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory\n(LASL) in the US.\n\nLASL designed and tested solid-core reactors for\nNERVA, and Westinghouse/Aerojet engineered them into\nactual rocket engines and tested them, see Fig. 11.22. Most\nof the LASL work was to design the fuel bars and their\ncooling channels so that their lifetime and integrity could be\nensured for at least several hours. The fuel was 238U enri-\nched with fissile 235U. As in commercial reactors, the fuel\nwas cladded by appropriate materials, e.g. zirconium alloys.\nTo enable operation at high temperatures, the low melting\npoint (1,405 K) uranium had to be replaced by its UO2\noxide (melting point 3,138 K). Nitrides and carbides of\nuranium were also tested successfully up to 2,775 K. The\nmost powerful Los Alamos reactor was Phoebus IIA, tested\nat 4.2 GW for 12 min. With a nozzle, the specific impulse\nwould have been 890 s, and the thrust approximately\n900 kN. Less powerful (10\u2013100 MW range) but more ver-\nsatile nuclear reactors and rocket engines were also\ndesigned and tested, see [8]. In the Soviet Union, ternary\nalloys were allegedly tested to 3,275 K.\n\n314 C. Bruno\n\n\n\nThe United States Air Force (USAF) took over nuclear\nreactor research in 1972, when NERVA was canceled. It\ndeveloped ceramic fuel (CERMET) reactors in the 1\u20132 GW\nrange capable of withstanding hundreds of on\u2013off cycles\nwithout cracking, and very compact nuclear reactors using\nfuel pebbles instead of fuel bars. These were called pebble\nbed reactors (PBR). These proved to be prone to thermo-\nhydraulic instabilities. The Brookhaven National Labora-\ntory (BNL), working for the US Navy, produced a PBR that\ncould be packaged inside a standard-size torpedo, about\n25 inches (635 mm) diameter. Its power was in the tens of\nMW range, but the reactor life expectancy was only a few\nminutes. The thermal power/unit volume was of the order of\n1 MW/liter. This technology has been proposed for in-space\npropulsion by the Plus Ultra Technologies company in the\nUS under the acronym MITEE. Plus Ultra has also inves-\ntigated very compact nuclear reactors using low critical\nmass fuels, for example, americium-242. Similar work was\ndone in Israel at Ben Gurion University, and his work has\nproduced 1-m size reactors capable of several tens of MW\n(just as for MITEE). Properly engineered, this reactor was\nproposed for a crewed Mars mission. This nuclear thermal\npropulsion engine is similar to one independently proposed\nby C. Rubbia in the 1990s.\n\nLiquid- and gas-core reactors have been investigated in\nRussia and in the US, but never built. Their theoretical\nspecific impulse may be expected to be at least 1,500 and\n3,000\u20135,000 s, respectively.\n\n11.9.1.2 Nuclear Electric Propulsion\nThe second nuclear propulsion strategy uses the reactor to\ngenerate electric power to run one or more of the thrusters\ndescribed in Sects. 11.6\u201311.8. This is called nuclear electric\npropulsion (NEP). The basic components are the reactor, a\nprime mover using a Rankine, Brayton, Stirling or other\ncycle (for instance a gas turbine) powered by the working\nfluid of the cycle, an electric generator driven by the prime\nmover, and the electric thruster. The thermodynamic cycle\nmay have an overall efficiency of the order of 30\u201340 % and\n\nthe remainder of the reactor thermal power must be\ndumped. In space, this means a space radiator. A space\nradiator is the most cumbersome and weighty element of a\nnuclear electric propulsion system, sometimes weighing\nmore than the reactor itself. The power radiated per unit\nmass is of the order of 0.4\u20131 kg/kW for metallic radiators\nbut much less for carbon nanotubes structures.\n\nGridded ion engines are already mature for nuclear\nelectric propulsion, but due to their low-pressure operation,\ntheir thrust is very small, at most 0.1\u20130.5 N for the fore-\nseeable future. Their specific impulse may however reach\nhundreds of km/s. Hall thrusters have already demonstrated\n1 N in ground testing, and can deliver specific impulses in\nthe 2,000\u20133,000 s range (up to 5,000 s with lighter pro-\npellants) and lifetimes in excess of 10,000 h. MPD and\narcjets are capable of higher thrust, but have not yet dem-\nonstrated specific impulses beyond 5,000 s, and must\nmature further.\n\nThe low thrust of all electric thrusters means that, for\nsignificant spacecraft acceleration and reduced mission\ntime, either the engine must be \u2018on\u2019 for most of the mission,\nor that the nuclear electric propulsion system must consists\nof tens or hundreds of thruster modules, or both. The first\napproach may be acceptable for scientific missions but\nposes severe reliability issues, and because the ground team\nmay be active for years, will be costly. A key issue with\nyears of operation of high power gridded ion thrusters is the\nlife of the grid. The high voltage means larger holes, but\nthicker grids can be used to offset some of the problems.\nWith most MPD thrusters that use electrodes, the key issue\nis anode/cathode erosion. And of course the nuclear reactors\nmust be capable of operating reliably and autonomously for\nyears. One problem is reactor refueling, if the life of the\nrods, bars, pins or pebbles is shorter than mission time. The\nsecond approach of increasing the total thrust by having\nmultiple thrusters, looks more practical, but it requires\nplenty of electric power. However, it increases overall\nsafety and reliability, because mission times may be\nshortened to months instead of years.\n\nFig. 11.22 Westinghouse-Aerojet NRX nuclear thermal space rocket\n(1965). The control drum absorbs neutrons depending on rotation\n\nangle in order to control the thrust, which was 75,000 lbf (333.6 kN) at\nspecific impulse of about 880 s\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 315\n\n\n\n11.9.1.3 Dual-Mode Nuclear Propulsion\nDual-mode propulsion seeks to optimize missions by\ncombining the best of the two nuclear propulsion strategies.\nNuclear thermal propulsion produces thrust similar to\nchemical propulsion, but the specific impulse is typically\nless than 1,000 s. Nuclear electric propulsion is mass-\nthrifty, but its thrust is inadequate, except where multiple\nthrusters are used. Russian work emphasizes the bi-modal\napproach, also proposed by NASA-Glenn, whereby part of\nthe nuclear reactor energy is for thrust, part is to power the\nsystems needed for the crew, and part is fed to the electric\nthrusters. Using a crewed Mars mission as a scenario,\nnuclear thermal propulsion allows escape velocities from\nLEO to be reached in just a few revolutions of a spiral\ntrajectory. Then the nuclear thermal propulsion is switched\noff and an electric thruster (with specific impulse\n4,000\u201315,000 s, and thrust 1\u201310 N) is turned on to power\nthe interplanetary leg of the trajectory and to decelerate.\nThe nuclear thermal propulsion is used again for Mars orbit\ncapture. Note that the same propellant (H2) can be used for\nboth propulsion systems. Dual mode operation avoids the\nvery long spiral trajectories imposed by the low thrust\ntypical of all electric thrusters, and thus avoids transiting the\ndeadly van Allen belts many tens or hundreds of times\nwhile accelerating to escape velocity.\n\nPlus Ultra Technologies has proposed a similar dual-\nmode concept based on MITEE [9]. The VASIMR engine in\ndevelopment by the Ad Astra Company is an \u2018infinitely\nvariable-mode\u2019 system: in principle, it is capable of varying\nboth its thrust and specific impulse so that their product\n(power) stays constant. The specific impulse of the VA-\nSIMR prototypes is about 5,000 s, and while its thrust is\nsmall it\u2019s at least ten if not a hundred times larger than that\nof a gridded ion thruster. As it is electrode-less, it may be\nmore reliable than high power arcjets or most MPD sys-\ntems, although at the cost of more complexity (RF gener-\nators, superconducting magnets, magnetic nozzle).\n\n11.9.1.4 A Comparison of Nuclear Electric\nPropulsion Versus Nuclear Thermal\nPropulsion\n\nNERVA-style nuclear thermal propulsion is capable of\nproducing an extremely large thrust at a specific impulse in\nthe 880\u2013900 s range. This technology is costly but feasible,\nand with PBR and higher temperature ceramics the specific\nimpulse may reach over 1,000 s. Nuclear electric propulsion\nconsumes less propellant, but at the price of low thrust. An\nimportant issue with nuclear electric propulsion is con-\nverting thermal power to electricity. A gas turbine Brayton\ncycle is best, if the gas turbine and its turbo-alternator or\ndynamo can work unattended for months on end. This gas\nturbine technology \u2018package\u2019 is now mature in the 1\nmegawatt thermal (MWth) range. A conversion efficiency,\n\ng, of approximately 25\u201330 % is feasible, with a total\nnuclear electric propulsion system mass of the order of\n1\u20132 t. Heat extraction may be based on a gas cycle, a liquid\nmetal cycle, or require heat pipes. In this context, the third\ndrawback of nuclear electric propulsion is its \u2018bottom\u2019\ntemperature, at which the (1 - g) of thermal power that is\nnot converted to mechanical work must be dumped by the\nspace radiator because if it is too low the radiator cannot\nradiate away enough waste power and if it is too high the\nefficiency drops.\n\nGridded ion engines are evolving towards 15,000 s, and\npotentially towards even higher specific impulses by\nexploiting magnetic confinement technology, such as\ntokamak; MPD thrusters may evolve rapidly if the electrode\nlife can be extended, and their eventual power and thrust\nmay be much higher. Their power/thrust ratio is still in the\n40\u201360 kW/N range, thus the power/mass of nuclear electric\npropulsion is about a few percentage points of nuclear\nthermal propulsion.\n\nDespite the stated disadvantages of nuclear electric\npropulsion, its advantages are remarkable in terms of inte-\ngration, e.g. in coupling turbine, electric generator and\nthruster(s): all of which can be optimized separately. Europe\nand the US have extensive gridded ion engine technology,\nwhile Russia leads in MPD and Hall thrusters. In addition,\nRussia has conceptually designed many dual-mode engines,\nand advocates nuclear propulsion as the best solution for\ncrewed Mars missions.\n\n11.9.1.5 Pulsed Nuclear Thermal Propulsion\nThis is a conceptual form of nuclear thermal propulsion\nemploying nuclear explosives (bombs). Developed initially\nfrom an idea by S. Ulam in 1958, it became Project Orion,\nfunded in the US DoD for several years. It consists of\ndetonating a sequence of atomic bombs ejected astern of a\nspacecraft, at a distance precisely matching the size of the\nfireball and the spacecraft\u2019s pressure plate. The expanding\ngas from each explosion has a velocity that depends on the\nyield. For instance, a 1-kt explosion has an ideal expansion\nvelocity of about 500 km/s, producing a very large dynamic\npressure on impact. The spacecraft receives each momen-\ntum/pressure pulse on its pressure plate, a flat structure that\nis connected to the spacecraft by shock absorbers. These\nmust be dimensioned to reduce the impulsive acceleration\nto a few g0. The original concept envisioned ejecting a\nseries of canisters through a hatch in the center of the plate,\neach containing a bomb and some propellant to enhance the\ngas expansion. The explosion frequency needed was esti-\nmated to be a few Hz.\n\nCalculations predicted specific impulses linearly pro-\nportional to, ve, with ve being the velocity of expansion of\nthe fireball. By optimizing the yield and the distance, the\nconstant of proportionality was found to be in the range\n\n316 C. Bruno\n\n\n\n0.1\u20130.5. This concept was successfully tested using con-\nventional explosive, however Project Orion was terminated\nin 1963.\n\nIts recent successors use a magnetic field to compress\nand fission Curium-245 (245Cm) fuel. The ionization and\nmagnetic fields created by the explosion produce pulsed\nLorentz forces in a magnetic nozzle. This concept is the so-\ncalled Magnetic Orion (MagOrion) project, investigated for\nthe USAF by Andrews Space in 2000 and 2003. Its simpler\nand smaller version is Project MiniMagOrion. The specific\nimpulse of MiniMagOrion was estimated to be 10,000 s,\nsufficient to enable a 100-t spacecraft to reach Mars in three\nmonths. However, the cost of validating this concept, its\ncomplexity, and doubts about the coupling efficiency\nbetween the electromagnetic pulse and the magnetic nozzle\nhalted the project in 2003.\n\n11.9.2 Solar Sails\n\nHarnessing the power of the Sun to propel a spacecraft may\nappear somewhat ambitious and the observation that light\nexerts a force contradicts our everyday experiences. How-\never, it is an accepted phenomenon that the quantum\npackets of energy which compose sunlight, that is to say\nphotons, perturb spacecraft through the conservation of\nmomentum; this perturbation is known as solar radiation\npressure (SRP). To be exact, the electromagnetic energy\nfrom the Sun pushes the spacecraft and Newton\u2019s second\nlaw states that momentum is transferred when the energy\nstrikes and when it is reflected. The concept of solar sailing\nexploits SRP to propel a spacecraft, potentially providing a\ncontinuous acceleration limited only by the lifetime of the\nsail materials in the space environment. The momentum\ncarried by an individual photon is extremely small. At best,\na solar sail will experience a force of 9 N/m2 of sail at\nEarth\u2019s distance from the Sun, so to provide a suitably large\nmomentum transfer the sail is required to have a large\nsurface area, while maintaining as low a mass as possible.\nAdding the impulse due to incident and reflected photons\nreveals that the idealized thrust vector is directed normal to\nthe surface of the sail. Hence by controlling the orientation\nof the sail relative to the Sun the spacecraft can gain or lose\norbital angular momentum. Using the momentum gained by\nreflecting these quantum packets of energy, the sail can\nslowly but continuously accelerate to accomplish a wide-\nrange of potential missions [10].\n\nOne of the key problems in solar sail design is the\npacking and subsequent deployment of a large area of thin\nfilm. The dimensional expansion ratio between a deployed\nand stowed solar sail can be over 100, thus innovative\nstructural engineering solutions are required. The packing\nand deployment problem has perhaps been one of the\n\ngreatest impediments to practical solar sail utilization. In\naddition, since the sail is folded for packing, the reflecting\nmedium of the sail must be mounted on a thin substrate. The\npresence of a substrate imposes a fundamental limitation on\nthe performance of the sail due to the parasitic mass, this\nbeing defined as the total non-reflective mass of the solar\nsail and attached spacecraft. The conventional belief is that\nthe solar sail film must be as flat as possible in order to\nmaintain as high a reflectivity as possible. If this is true,\nthen tension must be applied to the deployed sail, either by a\ndeployable structure or by spin-induced tension, or by a\ncombination of both. However, some evidence appears to\nsuggest that this may be a misconception and that a solar\nsail could conceivably be heavily wrinkled and remain\nsuitably reflective. Only in-flight data will provide conclu-\nsive resolution. It is immediately clear that this distinction is\nof critical importance, because if a sail film can be wrinkled\nthen the deployment structure need only support and not\ntension the film, whereas if the film cannot be wrinkled then\na much heavier structure is required to apply a tension.\nOnce deployed the sail film must be oriented to direct the\nsolar radiation pressure force for orbit maneuvering. Due to\nthe large moment of inertia of a solar sail innovative\nengineering is again required.\n\nThe sail film reflective layer is supported by a substrate.\nThe substrate is required principally to allow handling,\nfolding, packing and deployment. The substrate must be\ncoated with a suitable reflecting material for efficient photon\nreflection, and typically aluminum is favored. A further\nfront coating, such as silicon oxide, may also be required in\norder to reduce pre-launch oxidation of the reflecting sur-\nface with a resultant loss of reflectivity. Alternatively, an\nultraviolet-induced sublimation layer could be added to\nprevent pre-launch oxidation without adding mass to the\nactual solar sail flight mass. The sail substrate must have\nsufficient strength not to fail and create tears that may\npropagate during deployment or when fully deployed and\nunder tension, if tension is required following deployment.\nFurthermore, since the reflective coating on the sail film\nwill not have perfect reflectivity, a fraction of the incident\nsolar radiation will be absorbed by the substrate and this\nmust be dissipated through a thermally emitting rear surface\ncoating. The choice of a suitable, high emissivity rear-sur-\nface coating is yet another design decision. Thin-film\nchromium, with an emissivity of the order of 0.64 appears\nto be a suitable candidate.\n\nThe sail substrate contributes a significant proportion of\nthe total sail assembly mass, particularly for a large sail\nwhere the substrate mass dominates the sail\u2019s parasitic mass\nbreakdown. The production of very thin films with good\nmechanical and thermal properties is thus central to solar\nsail realization. There is extensive industrial experience of\nthe manufacture, coating and handling of thin films for a\n\n11 Spacecraft Propulsion 317\n\n\n\nnumber of ground and space applications. For example,\nprimary spacecraft insulation is typically provided by multi-\nlayer insulation (MLI) blankets which are constructed of\nalternative layers of aluminum coated Mylar? or Kapton?\n\nand a thin net of material such as nylon, Dacron?, Nomex?\n\nor bridal veil. Note, however, that currently the typical\nthickness of commercially available thin films is excessive\nfor moderate performance solar sails. Mylar is commer-\ncially available down to a thickness of only 0.9 lm, but it\nhas a low resistance to solar ultraviolet radiation and so is\nunsuitable for long-duration exposure without double-sided\ncoatings. Several thin film materials have been considered\nas potential sail substrates. Until recently the optimal sail\nfilm was generally considered to be Kapton. This does not\nhave a melting point as such, but it does suffer a phase\ntransition (glass transition temperature) above approxi-\nmately 680 K. The safe, long-term maximum operating\ntemperature for solar sail applications is thus generally\nconsidered to be between 520\u2013570 K. It is this thermal limit\nwhich gives rise to the widely accepted minimum helio-\ncentric radius of 0.25 au for solar sailing, although of\ncourse this does not take into account the thermal limits of\nthe sail booms and other structural components, nor does it\naccount for the thermal limits of the attached spacecraft. An\nall-aluminum sail film (that is to say one with no substrate)\nactually has a very similar minimum heliocentric distance\neven though bulk aluminum has a much higher melting\npoint. The production of sail film of the order of 2 lm has\nrecently been identified as a key technology requirement for\nmid-term solar sailing [10]. Such thin films are not routinely\nused for large volume commercial purposes, mainly due to\nthe difficulty of handling them during manufacture. In\naddition to solar sails, other space applications such as solar\nconcentrators and space telescope sunshades also require\nfilms thinner than commercially available Kapton. To this\nend, NASA and SRS Technologies have produced Clear\nPlastic-1 (CP-1) film down to a gauge of order 2 lm. This\nhas very similar properties to Kapton film, making it highly\nsuitable for solar sail applications. Indeed, CP-1 film is now\ngenerally accepted to be the sail film of choice.\n\nA significant amount of development has been conducted\nsince the 1990s into solar sail technology, and the deploy-\nment of large gossamer structures. Much of this technology\ndevelopment has focused on the sail film supporting booms\nthat must be deployed post-launch, and has spawned a range\nof solutions from CFRP bistable booms to inflatable booms.\nFigure 11.23 shows a solar sail demonstrator made by\nL\u2019Garde that was deployed in a large thermal vacuum\nchamber under ambient space conditions at NASA\u2019s Glenn\nResearch Center in 2005. This same technology was\nselected for flight in 2011 as a NASA technology demon-\nstration mission. The solar sail of the L\u2019Garde Technology\nDemonstration Mission, named Sunjammer, will have seven\n\ntimes the area (1,200 m2) of the first sail flown in space,\nJAXA\u2019s IKAROS sail (Interplanetary Kite-craft Acceler-\nated by Radiation Of the Sun), and at 32 kg it will weigh 10\ntimes less. The L\u2019Garde solar sail will produce a maximum\nthrust of approximately 0.01 N, giving it a sail loading (see\nlater) of just over 25 g/m2 and a characteristic acceleration\n(see later) of approximately 0.25 mm/s2. The Sunjammer\nsail is shown in Fig. 11.24 undergoing a single quadrant\ndeployment test.\n\n11.9.2.1 A Quantum Description of Solar\nRadiation Pressure\n\nUsing quantum mechanics, radiation pressure can be visu-\nalized as momentum transported by photons impacting on\nand then reflecting off a surface. As previously stated in\nChap. 4, the term \u2018photon\u2019 was coined by Gilbert N. Lewis\nin a letter to Nature magazine in 1926 [11, 12]. From\nPlanck\u2019s law, a photon of frequency m will transport the\nenergy given by\n\nE \u00bc hm \u00f011:29\u00de\n\nwhere h is Planck\u2019s constant. Using Special Relativity the\ntotal energy of a moving body may be written as\n\nE2 \u00bc m20c4 \u00fe p2c2 \u00f011:30\u00de\n\nwhere c is the speed of light. Since a photon has zero rest\nmass, its energy may be written as\n\nE \u00bc pc: \u00f011:31\u00de\n\nUsing the photon energy defined by Eqs. 11.29 and\n11.31, the momentum transported by a single photon is\n\np \u00bc hm\nc\n: \u00f011:32\u00de\n\nThe pressure on a body is found through consideration of\nthe momentum transported by a flux of photons. At distance\nr from the Sun the energy flux may be written in terms of\nthe solar luminosity, LS, and scaled by the Sun\u2013Earth dis-\ntance, giving\n\nW \u00bc LS\n4pR2e\n\nRe\nr\n\n? ?2\n\u00bc We\n\nRe\nr\n\n? ?2\n\u00f011:33\u00de\n\nwhere Re is the mean distance of the Earth from the Sun, i.e.\nequivalent to 1 au. From Eq. 11.33, the energy DE trans-\nported across a surface of area A, normal to the incident\nradiation, in time Dt is given by,\n\nDE \u00bc WADt: \u00f011:34\u00de\n\nFrom Eq. 11.31, the energy then transports momentum\nDp\n\n318 C.

How-\never, inefficiencies means that the factor will always be less\nthan two.\n\n11.9.2.2 Force on a Perfectly Reflecting Solar Sail\nThe acceleration experienced by a solar sail is a function of\nthe attitude of the sail\u2019s reflective surface with respect to the\nSun. For a solar sail, the force exerted on the surface due to\nincident photons is given by\n\nFi \u00bc PA ui:n\u00f0 \u00deui: \u00f011:38\u00de\n\nThe reflected photons will exert a force of equal mag-\nnitude on the surface, but in the specular reflected direction,\n?ur\n\nFr \u00bc ?PA ui:n\u00f0 \u00deur: \u00f011:39\u00de\n\nNoting that ui ? ur \u00bc 2 ui:n\u00f0 \u00de2n, the total force exerted\non the solar sail is given by\n\nF \u00bc 2PA ui:n\u00f0 \u00de2n: \u00f011:40\u00de\n\nThe total force may this be written as\n\nF \u00bc 2AWe\nc\n\nRe\nr\n\n? ?2\nui:n\u00f0 \u00de2n: \u00f011:41\u00de\n\nThe solar sail\u2019s performance is quantified by the total\nspacecraft mass per unit area (m/A) and is called the \u2018sail\nloading\u2019. This is an important solar sail design parameter.\nThe sail pitch angle is defined as the angle between the sail\nnormal and the incident radiation. Using these definitions\nthe solar sail acceleration may now be written as\n\nas \u00bc\n2We\n\nc\n\n1\nr\n\nRe\nr\n\n? ?2\ncos2 a\u00f0 \u00den: \u00f011:42\u00de\n\nThe characteristic acceleration is defined as the actual\nacceleration experienced by the sail at a heliocentric dis-\ntance of 1 au with the orientated sail normal to the Sun, such\nthat a \u00bc 0. The characteristic acceleration is a further\ndesign parameter and may be written as\n\nas \u00bc\n9:12g\n\nr g m?2\u00bd ? mm s\n?2ffi ? \u00f011:43\u00de\n\nwhere an overall efficiency factor, g, is used to account for\nthe finite reflectivity of the sail film. Typically the total solar\nsail efficiency is of the order of 85\u201390 %. It is important to\nnote that although the efficiency of a sail does not alter its\ncharacteristic acceleration, it will alter the physical\ndimensions of the sail. The solar sail acceleration may also\nbe written in terms of the solar gravitational acceleration as\n\nas \u00bc b\nGMs\n\nr2\nr? ? n\u00f0 \u00de2n: \u00f011:44\u00de\n\nThe dimensionless sail parameter b is defined as the ratio\nof the solar radiation pressure acceleration to the solar\ngravitational acceleration. This is called the \u2018lightness\nnumber\u2019 of the sail. The solar radiation pressure accelera-\ntion and the solar gravitational acceleration are both\nassumed to have an inverse square variation, therefore the\nlightness number is independent of the heliocentric distance\nof the sail. A more rigorous examination of the effect of\nradiation pressure on a surface can be found through the use\nof radiative transfer methods and an examination of the\neffect of a non-ideal reflecting solar sail, as in [13].\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Practical examples of such sys-\ntems as well as the fundamentals of AOCS analysis and\ndesign are emphasized throughout this chapter.\n\nA typical AOCS architecture is illustrated in Fig. 12.1.\nThe attitude determination and control system (ADCS) is\none of the key subsystems of most spacecraft, and it consists\nof an attitude determination system (ADS) and an attitude\ncontrol system (ACS). The ADCS provides the stabilization\nand control of the attitude (orientation) of a spacecraft using\na variety of sensors and actuators in the presence of dis-\nturbance torques. The guidance, navigation, and control\n(GNC) system of a spacecraft is concerned with the orbital\nmotion (trajectory) of the spacecraft\u2019s center of mass. The\norbital GNC system is an area of space technology that\nplays a key role in the success of space missions that\ninvolve rendezvous, docking, and proximity operations. An\nintegrated ADCS/GNC system is often referred to as the\nspacecraft AOCS. The GNC system and ADCS are ana-\nlyzed and designed separately for most satellites, however.\nIn order to accomplish various GNC tasks, the GNC system\nincludes the sensors that provide measurements, the GNC\nsoftware implemented in the on-board computer, and the\nactuators. The GNC software includes the navigation filter,\nthe guidance algorithm, and the control algorithm, as\nillustrated in Fig. 12.1.\n\nAn in-depth and comprehensive treatment of spacecraft\nattitude determination theory and applications is provided in\n\n[1]. Detailed descriptions of spacecraft guidance and control\nproblems can be found in [2, 3]. Modern treatment of\nspacecraft attitude dynamics and control problems of\npractical interest can be found in [4, 5]. The ADCS/GNC\nsystems are also discussed in [6\u20138] from the viewpoint of\nspacecraft systems engineering.\n\nThe fundamentals of attitude determination and control\nwill be discussed in Sect. 12.1, and the ADCS will be fur-\nther discussed in Sect. 12.2. The principles of orbital GNC\nsystems will be treated in Sect. 12.3 with a detailed dis-\ncussion of the orbital rendezvous problem.\n\n12.1 Fundamentals of Attitude\nDetermination and Control\n\n12.1.1 Rotational Kinematics\n\nThe spacecraft attitude determination and control problem\ninvolves rotational kinematics. In this section, the rotational\nkinematics of a rigid body are considered to describe the\norientation of a spacecraft that is in rotational motion.\nThroughout this section, the orientation of a reference frame\nfixed in a body is used to describe the orientation of the\nspacecraft body itself. This section is based on [5, Chap. 5].\n\n12.1.1.1 Direction Cosine Matrix\nConsider a reference frame A with a right-handed set of\nthree orthogonal unit vectors f~a1;~a2;~a3g and a reference\nframe B with another right-handed set of three orthogonal\n\nunit vectors f~b1;~b2;~b3g.

Crij2\n\nwhere {r1, \u2026, rn} are a set of known reference unit vectors\n(e.g., the direction of the Earth, the Sun, a star, or the\ngeomagnetic field) in the inertial frame, {b1, \u2026, bn} are a\nset of the corresponding measured (observed) unit vectors in\nthe spacecraft body-fixed frame, and n is the total number of\nmeasurements. Because these vectors are inaccurate, the\nweighting coefficients ai are to be properly chosen to find\nthe least-squares estimate of C. This problem was first\n\nposed by Wahba in 1965 [9] and is often referred to in the\nliterature as Wahba\u2019s problem.\n\n12.1.3.1 TRIAD Algorithm\nConsider an attitude determination problem using only two\nvector measurements. The problem here is to determine the\ndirection cosine matrix C for the two observation unit\nvectors, b1 and b2, corresponding to the two nonparallel\nreference unit vectors, r1 and r2, as follows\n\nb1  Cr1; b2  Cr2: \u00f012:42\u00de\n\nAssuming that {r1, b1} are more accurate than {r2, b2},\ntwo sets of new basis vectors can be defined as\n\nx1 \u00bc r1; x2 \u00bc r1?r2r1?r2j j ; x3 \u00bc x1 ? x2 \u00f012:43\u00de\n\ny1 \u00bc b1; y2 \u00bc b1?b2b1?b2j j ; y3 \u00bc y1 ? y2 : \u00f012:44\u00de\n\nThese are two triads of orthonormal unit vectors.

It was first proposed in [10] for a\nsimple, but non-optimal, estimation of C using two vector\nobservations. Note that Cr1 becomes exactly b1 and that\nCr2 doesn\u2019t become exactly b2. The necessary and sufficient\ncondition for b2 ? Cr2 is\n\nrT1 r2 \u00bc bT1 b2: \u00f012:48\u00de\n\nAs discussed in [1, pp. 426\u2013428], a major drawback of the\nTRIAD algorithm is its ad hoc nature. The two measure-\nments are heuristically combined to obtain an attitude esti-\nmate but the combination is not optimal in any statistical\nsense. Although the TRIAD algorithm has been imple-\nmented in numerous space missions, it cannot be easily\napplied to star trackers that provide many simultaneous\nvector measurements. The error covariance matrix associ-\nated with an estimated C is often computed in terms of Euler\nangles [12]. Efficient methods for computing the covariance\nmatrix of the TRIAD algorithm are presented in [11, 12].\n\n328 B.

It provides an optimal least-squares\nestimate of C by solving the eigenvalue/eigenvector prob-\nlem of the matrix K to find the optimal quaternion.\n\nFor the purpose of computationally efficient on-board\nimplementation of the q-method, the QUEST (QUaternion\nESTimator) algorithm was proposed in [12], which is\nbriefly introduced in this section as follows. As the gain\nfunction and loss function are related as\n\nG \u00bc\nXn\ni\u00bc1\n\nai ? L \u00bc 1? L \u00f012:61\u00de\n\nit follows that\n\nkmax \u00bc 1?

Further detailed discussions of the\nQUEST method and its 3 9 3 quaternion covariance matrix\ncan be found in [12]. A different way of finding the direction\ncosine matrix that minimizes Wahba\u2019s loss function using\nthe singular value decomposition of the matrix B is pre-\nsented in [13].\n\n12.1.4 Recursive Attitude Determination\n\nThe attitude determination problem considered in the pre-\nceding section is a static, single-frame attitude determina-\ntion problem in which all of the vector measurements are\nmade at the same attitude. In this section, a general recur-\nsive estimation problem of time-varying attitude is consid-\nered. Although QUEST-based recursive methods have been\ndeveloped in [14\u201316], Kalman filtering is the primary\nmeans of real-time spacecraft attitude estimation in the\npresence of various sensor errors [17\u201320].\n\n12.1.4.1 QUEST-Based Recursive Methods\nA simple solution to the time-varying attitude estimation\nproblem was proposed in [14]. It is based on propagating\nand updating the matrix B, as follows\n\nB\u00f0tj\u00de \u00bc lU3?3\u00f0tj; tj?1\u00deB\u00f0tj?1\u00de \u00fe\nXnj\ni\u00bc1\n\naibir\nT\ni \u00f012:69\u00de\n\nwhere U393(tj, tj-1) is the state transition matrix of the\nattitude rotation matrix C, l\\ 1 is a fading memory factor\nto be properly chosen, and nj is the total number of vector\nobservations at time tj. The optimal attitude estimate at tj is\nthen computed by the QUEST algorithm for B(tj).\n\nThe REQUEST algorithm proposed in [15] propagates\nand updates Davenport\u2019s matrix K as\n\nK\u00f0tj\u00de \u00bc lU\u00f0tj; tj?1\u00deK\u00f0tj?1\u00deUT\u00f0tj; tj?1\u00de \u00fe\nXnj\ni\u00bc1\n\naiKi \u00f012:70\u00de\n\nwhere U(tj, tj-1) is the 4 9 4 quaternion state transition\nmatrix and Ki is Davenport\u2019s matrix K for a single\nobservation.\n\nA major disadvantage of such QUEST-based recursive\nmethods is the use of a simple fading memory scalar\napproximation for the sensor and process noises. The per-\nformance of the QUEST-based methods has been signifi-\ncantly improved by an extended QUEST algorithm [15, 16].\nIn [16], the fading memory factor is optimized using a\nstatistical cost function recasting the REQUEST algorithm\nin a statistical filtering framework. The Extended QUEST\nalgorithm solves the attitude estimation problem by finding\nthe attitude quaternion qj and the auxiliary state vector xj,\nwhich minimize the loss function\n\nJ\u00f0qj; xj\u00de \u00bc\n1\n2\n\nXnj\ni\u00bc1\n\nr?2i jbi ?

Wie et al.\n\n\n\n12.1.5 Introduction to Spacecraft Attitude\nControl\n\n12.1.5.1 Quaternion Feedback Control\nMost three-axis stabilized spacecraft use a sequence of\nrotational maneuvers about each control axis. Many\nspacecraft also perform rotational maneuvers about an\ninertially fixed axis during an acquisition mode (e.g., Sun-\nacquisition or Earth-acquisition) so that a particular sensor\nwill pick up a particular target. Spacecraft are sometimes\nrequired to maneuver as fast as possible within the physical\nlimits of their actuators and sensors. Because quaternions\nare well suited for on-board real-time computation, space-\ncraft orientation is nowadays commonly described in terms\nof the quaternions. A simple quaternion-feedback control\nlogic for three-axis, large-angle reorientation maneuvers [3]\nis briefly introduced here.\n\nConsider the attitude dynamics of a rigid spacecraft\ndescribed by Euler\u2019s rotational equation of motion of the\nform\n\nJ _x\u00fe x? Jx \u00bc u \u00f012:113\u00de\n\nwhere u = (u1, u2, u3) is the control torque input vector.\nThe quaternion kinematic differential equations are given\nby\n\n_q1\n_q2\n_q3\nq4\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775 \u00bc\n\n1\n2\n\n0 x3 ?x2 x1\n?x3 0 x1 x2\nx2 ?x1 0 x3\n?x1 ?x2 ?x3 0\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775\n\nq1\nq2\nq3\nq4\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775: \u00f012:114\u00de\n\nA linear state feedback controller of the following form\ncan be employed for large-angle reorientation maneuvers\n\nu \u00bc ?K?qe ? Cx \u00f012:115\u00de\n\nwhere ?qe \u00bc \u00f0q1e; q2e; q3e\u00de is the attitude-error quaternion\nvector and K and C are controller gain matrices to be\ndetermined. The controller gain matrices can be simply\nselected as K = kJ and C = cJ where k and c are positive\nscalars to be properly chosen [3]. The attitude-error qua-\nternions (q1e, q2e, q3e, q4e) are computed using the desired or\ncommanded attitude quaternions (q1c, q2c, q3c, q4c) and the\ncurrent attitude quaternions (q1, q2, q3, q4) [3], as follows\n\nq1e\nq2e\nq3e\nq4e\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775 \u00bc\n\nq4c q3c ?q2c ?q1c\n?q3c q4c q1c ?q2c\nq2c ?q1c q4c ?q3c\nq1c q2c q3c q4c\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775\n\nq1\nq2\nq3\nq4\n\n2\n664\n\n3\n775 \u00f012:116\u00de\n\nIf the commanded attitude quaternion vector is simply\nthe origin defined as\n\n\u00f0q1c; q2c; q3c; q4c\u00de \u00bc \u00f00; 0; 0;\u00fe1\u00de\n\nthen the control logic of Eq. 12.115 becomes\n\nu \u00bc ?K?q? Cx \u00f012:117\u00de\n\nwhere ?q \u00bc \u00f0q1; q2; q3\u00de.Detailed discussions and applications\nof the quaternion-feedback control logic can be found in [3].\n\n12.1.5.2 PID: Classical Proportional-Integral-\nDerivative Control\n\nThe PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control logic is\ncommonly used in most feedback controllers, including\nspacecraft attitude control systems. To illustrate the basic\nconcept of the PID control, consider a typical single-axis\nattitude control problem of spacecraft. This so-called double\nintegrator plant is described by\n\nJ\u20ach\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc u\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe w\u00f0t\u00de \u00f012:118\u00de\n\nwhere J is the spacecraft inertia, h is the spacecraft attitude,\nu is the control torque, and w is the external disturbance\ntorque.\n\nAssuming that the spacecraft attitude and angular rate\ncan be directly measured, a standard PD (proportional-\nderivative) control logic can be expressed as\n\nu\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc ?KPh\u00f0t\u00de ? KD _h\u00f0t\u00de \u00f012:119\u00de\n\nwhere KP and KD are controller gains to be properly\ndetermined. The closed-loop system is then described by\n\nJ\u20ach\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe KD _h\u00f0t\u00de \u00fe KPh\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc w\u00f0t\u00de: \u00f012:120\u00de\n\nThe closed-loop characteristic equation of the system is\n\nJs2 \u00fe KDs\u00fe KP \u00bc 0:\n\nThe control design task is to properly determine KP and\nKD to meet given performance/stability specifications of the\nclosed-loop system. Let xn and f be the desired natural\nfrequency and damping ratio of the closed-loop poles. Then\nthe desired closed-loop characteristic equation becomes\n\ns2 \u00fe 2fxns\u00fe x2n \u00bc 0\n\nand the controller gains KP and KD can be determined as\n\nKP \u00bc Jx2n \u00f012:121a\u00de\n\nKD \u00bc 2Jfxn: \u00f012:121b\u00de\n\nThe damping ratio f is often selected as\n0.5 B f B 0.707, and the natural frequency xn is then\nconsidered as the bandwidth of the PD controller of a sys-\ntem with a rigid-body mode. For a unit-step disturbance,\nthis closed-loop systemwith the PD controller results in a\nnon-zero steady-state attitude h(?) = 1/KP. However, the\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 333\n\n\n\nsteady-state attitude error h(?) can be made small by\ndesigning a high-bandwidth control system.\n\nIn order to keep the desired attitude to be h = 0 at steady\nstate in the presence of a constant disturbance, consider a\nPID controller of the form\n\nu\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc ?KPh\u00f0t\u00de ? KI\nZ\n\nh\u00f0t\u00dedt ? KD _h\u00f0t\u00de: \u00f012:122\u00de\n\nIt can be shown that for a constant disturbance, the\nclosed-loop system with the PID controller, in fact, results\nin a zero steady-state output h(?) = 0.\n\nThe closed-loop characteristic equation can be found as\n\nJs3 \u00fe KDs2 \u00fe KPs\u00fe KI \u00bc 0\n\nand the desired closed-loop characteristic equation can be\nexpressed as\n\n\u00f0s2 \u00fe 2fxns\u00fe x2n\u00de\u00f0s\u00fe 1=T\u00de \u00bc 0\n\nwhere xn and f denote, respectively, the natural frequency\nand damping ratio of the complex poles associated with the\nrigid-body mode, and T is the time constant of the real pole\nassociated with integral control. The PID controller gains\ncan then be determined as\n\nKP \u00bc J x2n \u00fe\n2fxn\n\nT\n\n? ?\n\u00f012:123a\u00de\n\nKI \u00bc J\nx2n\nT\n\n\u00f012:123b\u00de\n\nKD \u00bc J 2fxn \u00fe\n1\nT\n\n? ?\n: \u00f012:123c\u00de\n\nThe time constant T of integral control is often selected\nas\n\nT ? 10\nfxn\n\n:\n\n12.1.5.3 Modern State-Feedback Control Design\nConsider a linearized spacecraft dynamics model as\ndescribed by the following state-space equation\n\n_x \u00bc Ax\u00fe Bu \u00f012:124\u00de\n\nwhere x is the state vetctor and u is the control input vector.\nThe linear state-feedback control law is assumed as\n\nu \u00bc ?Kx: \u00f012:125\u00de\n\nThe gain matrix K of the state feedback control logic can\nbe determined by minimizing the linear quadratic perfor-\nmance index\n\nJ \u00bc 1\n2\n\nZ 1\n0\n\u00f0xT Qx\u00fe uT Ru\u00dedt \u00f012:126\u00de\n\nwhere Q is the state weighting matrix and R is the control\ninput weighting matrix. The gain matrix K is then obtained\nas\n\nK \u00bc R?1BT X \u00f012:127\u00de\n\nby solving the algebraic Riccati equation\n\n0 \u00bc AT X\u00fe XA ? XBR?1BT X\u00feQ: \u00f012:128\u00de\n\nFor further details of linear-quadratic regulator (LQR)\ncontrol theory and applications, see [21].\n\nIf the actual state is not available for state-feedback\ncontrol, a spacecraft\u2019s dynamics can be considered to be\ndescribed by the following state-space equation\n\n_x \u00bc Ax\u00fe Bu\u00feGw \u00f012:129a\u00de\n\ny \u00bc Cx\u00fe v \u00f012:129b\u00de\n\nwhere w is the process noise and v is the measurement\nnoise. Both w and v are assumed to be white noise processes\nwith\n\nE\u00bdw\u00f0t\u00dewT\u00f0s\u00de? \u00bcWd\u00f0t ? s\u00de\nE\u00bdv\u00f0t\u00devT\u00f0s\u00de? \u00bc Vd\u00f0t ? s\u00de\n\nwhere W and V are the corresponding spectral density\nmatrices. The estimated-state feedback controller is then\ndescribed by\n\n_?x \u00bc Ax?\u00fe Bu\u00fe L\u00f0y? Cx?\u00de \u00f012:130\u00de\n\nu \u00bc ?Kx? \u00f012:131\u00de\n\nwhere x? is the estimated state for feedback control, K is the\nregulator gain matrix, and L the estimator gain matrix. The\ncontroller gain matrix K is determined by Eq. 12.127, and\nthe estimator gain matrix L of the linear-quatratic-estimator\n(LQE) is selected such that the observation error\n\ne \u00bc x? x? \u00f012:132\u00de\n\nis minimized in the presence of noise, which is done by\nsolving the algebraic Riccati equation\n\n0 \u00bc AY\u00fe YAT ?

Wie et al.\n\n\n\nA more detailed treatment of linear-quadratic-gaussian\n(LQG) control theory and applications to aerospace\ndynamical systems can be found in [21, 22].\n\n12.2 ADCS: Attitude Determination\nand Control Systems\n\nThe attitude determination and control system (ADCS)\nstabilizes, controls and positions a satellite in a desired\norientation despite any external or internal disturbances\nacting on it. The satellite\u2019s payload requires a specific\npointing direction whether the payload is a camera, a sci-\nence instrument, or an antenna. Satellites also require ori-\nentation for thermal control, or to acquire the Sun for their\nsolar panels. The ADCS system uses sensors in order to\ndetermine a satellite\u2019s attitude and actuators to control the\nvehicle to a required direction. The ADCS also needs to\nachieve the various mission and payload objectives such as\npointing accuracy, stability, rotational rate (slew) and\nsensing with many physical constraints such as mass,\npower, volume, computer power/storage, space environ-\nment, robustness/lifetime and cost. As previously stated, the\nADCS is a synthesis of two subsystems the attitude deter-\nmination system (ADS) and the attitude control system\n(ACS) that controls the attitude/motion of a satellite as\ndepicted in Fig. 12.2.\n\nSpace mission requirements, satellite size, cost and the\nspace environment lead to different and diverse choices for\nthe selection of ADCS hardware and control schemes. This\nsection provides a top-level insight into the design of a\npractical ADCS. Additional information on ADCS tech-\nnology can be found in Refs. [1, 4\u20138].\n\n12.2.1 Requirements and Stabilization\nMethods\n\nSatellites come with very diverse attitude determination and\ncontrol requirements depending on their mission, orbit, and\n\npayload. For example, Earth observation satellites require\nvery high levels of pointing and stability in order to ensure\nthat their images are not blurry, or in order to efficiently\ntransmit on-board data to specific ground stations. Actuators\nsuch as reaction wheels, thrusters or electro-magnets\n(magnetorquers) which can be used to maneuver a space-\ncraft (change its attitude) can cause disturbance torques\nthemselves that require careful selection and design of both\nactuators and sensors. Table 12.1 lists the typical ADCS\nrequirements for a satellite mission.\n\nHaving established the ADCS requirements, it is\nimportant to select the way that a spacecraft will be con-\ntrolled. There are several methods of controlling a\nspacecraft.\n\n12.2.1.1 Gravity Gradient\nGravity gradient stabilization exploits Newton\u2019s law of\ngeneral gravitation, and through the use of gravitational\nforces can always keep a spacecraft nadir-pointing. This is\nachieved by using a boom to extend a small distinct mass\n(usually a magnetometer in order to minimize magnetic\ninterference) from the spacecraft, which becomes the sec-\nond distinct mass, by a distance of 3\u20136 m. These two\nmasses, which are connected by a thin and light boom, can\nthen be used to exploit the difference in gravitational pull on\nthe main satellite platform and the additional mass (mag-\nnetometer, say) due to the difference in their distance from\nEarth. This small difference can be sufficient to enable the\nsatellite/additional mass system to be aligned with the\nradius vector at all times as an orbiting pendulum. The\ngravity gradient stabilization scheme can be beneficial for\ncoarse pointing (*5?) around the nadir axis, while the other\ntwo axes will still need to be stabilized. This method of\nstabilization was first exploited by the US Department of\nDefense Gravity Experiment (DODGE) satellite in 1967,\nwhich captured the first color full-Earth image; see\nFig. 12.3. Gravity gradient stabilization was also used on\nearly UoSAT satellites, from Surrey Satellite Technology\nLtd. (SSTL) in the UK, in the 1980s, which were used to\nstore and forward communications [23].\n\nAttitude Controller \n\nReference \nAttitude, ref \n\nActuator \n\nAttitude Estimation Sensors Satellite Dynamics \n\n+\n\n-\n\nAttitude \nError e \n\nDisturbance \nTorque, Nd \n\n+\n+\n\nActuator \nTorque, Na ? ?\n\nFig. 12.2 Attitude control\nsystem, control diagram. Image\nMalcolm Macdonald\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 335\n\n\n\n12.2.1.2 Magnetic Stabilization\nBy approximating the Earth\u2019s magnetic field as a dipole, it\nis possible to have a satellite use a magnetometer to track\nthe Earth\u2019s magnetic field lines in a \u2018compass mode\u2019 thus\nallows the vehicle to be passively stabilized but with coarse\nattitude (5\u201310?) due to the various irregularities and har-\nmonics of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field [1, 4].\n\n12.2.1.3 Spin Stabilization\nSpinning a satellite generates an angular momentum vector\nthat remains nearly fixed in inertial space. The angular\n\nmomentum generated provides gyroscopic stiffness to a\nspinning satellite, making it less prone to external distur-\nbances and more stable for thruster/apogee motor firings.\nThis passive stabilization technique was popular in the\n1970s with GEO communication satellites and is still used\nduring the cruise phase of interplanetary missions due to its\nsimplicity and systems benefits for thermal and communi-\ncation purposes. Detailed dynamical formulations for\nspinners can be found in Refs. [1, 4\u20138] (Fig. 12.4).\n\n12.2.1.4 Dual Spin Stabilization\nAs a variation of the spin based stabilization scheme, a dual\nspin satellite has two parts of its structure spinning at dif-\nferent angular rates about the same axis. In this case, one\nsection of the satellite spins to provide angular momentum,\nwhile the other part (platform) is de-spun and points in a\nfixed direction, for example towards the Earth. Such a\nscheme can be beneficial for a spacecraft in which the\nstructure (diameter) of the platform is required to be \u2018thin\u2019\nto fit in a launch vehicle fairing. The disadvantage of this\nscheme is the added complexity for carrying bearings and\nslip rings between the rotating parts of the satellite. Dual\nspin satellites were also popular in the 1970s, in particular\nfor GEO satellites where the high gain antennas could stay\nfixed towards Earth.\n\n12.2.1.5 Bias Momentum Stabilization\nAs a 3-axis system, a momentum bias system uses one\nactuator-momentum wheel aligned about the pitch axis\nnormal to the orbit plane. Gyroscopic stiffness is used in\norder to control the vehicle by keeping the momentum\nwheel spinning at a constant rate. Small variations in wheel\nspeed facilitate control of the pitch axis. Yaw-roll coupling\nfor nadir-pointing bias momentum systems can be used to\ncontrol the other two axes.\n\nTable 12.1 ADCS performance requirements [8, 38]\n\nRequirement Definition Example\n\nDetermination\n\nAccuracy/attitude\nknowledge\n\nHow well a satellite\u2019s orientation is with respect to an\nabsolute reference\n\n0.1?, 3-r\n\nRange Range of angular motion over which accuracy must be met Attitude attained within 30? of nadir\n\nControl\n\nAccuracy How well the satellite attitude can be controlled with\nrespect to a commanded direction\n\n0.1?, 3-r; includes determination and control errors\n\nRange Range of angular motion over which control performance\nmust be met\n\nFull range, within 30? of nadir, 20? of sun\n\nStability/jitter A specified angle bound or angular rate limit on short-term,\nhigh frequency motion\n\n0.1?/s or a required value to keep spacecraft motion\nfrom blurring sensor/imager data\n\nSlew rate/agility Slew or angular rate required to perform a rapid maneuver 3?/s\n\nDrift A limit on slow, low frequency vehicle motion 1?/hr\n\nSettling time Allowed time to recover from maneuvers or upsets 2? maximum rotation, used to limit nutation, wobbling\n\nFig. 12.3 The first full face color portrait of the earth taken by the\nDODGE satellite in 1967; taken at an altitude of 29,000 km.

The small\ndisc in front of the picture is a colour match card. Image US DoD\n\n336 B. Wie et al.\n\n\n\n12.2.1.6 Zero Momentum Stabilization\nMost spacecraft today use the 3-axis zero momentum sta-\nbilization scheme because it can provide higher accuracy. In\nthese systems, reaction wheels are used for each axis in\norder to compensate for external disturbances and to com-\nplete various commanded maneuvers. A pointing error is\nused to make the reaction wheels accelerate from an initial\nzero value and then the wheels move to a small spin rate\nthat keeps increasing due to the maneuvers required and due\nto secular disturbances, taking them to their saturation\nlimits. This requires a desaturation strategy, known as\n\u2018momentum dumping\u2019 or unloading, that uses magnetor-\nquers or thrusters to enable the wheels to be spun-down.\n\n12.2.2 An Attitude Determination System\nExample\n\nAs an example of a spacecraft attitude determination system\n(ADS), consider the Inertial Stellar Compass (ISC) devel-\noped by the Draper Laboratory for NASA\u2019s New Millen-\nnium Program ST-6 project [24]. Its performance was\nsuccessfully flight validated aboard the TacSat-2 satellite\nlaunched on December 16, 2006. The ISC is a miniature,\nlow-power ADS developed for use with low-cost small\nsatellites. It was designed to be suitable for a wide range of\nfuture missions because of its low mass, low power, and low\nvolume design, and its self-initializing, autonomous opera-\ntional capability. The ISC is composed of a wide field-of-\nview active-pixel star camera and micro-gyros, with asso-\nciated data processing and power electronics, as illustrated\nin Fig. 12.5. Periodic updates from the star camera are used\nto correct the effect of gyro drift and bias on obtaining the\nattitude quaternion information from the rate gyros. The\nunique feature of the ISC is that those two miniaturized\ndevices are integrated into a very low mass and low power\n\nunit along with a microprocessor. It has a total mass of\n2.5 kg, a power requirement of 3.5 W, and an accuracy of\n0.1? (1 %).\n\n12.3 Disturbance Torques\n\nIn order to design and size an ADCS, the torques acting on\nthe spacecraft must be quantified in a similar fashion to the\norbit perturbations discussed in Chap. 4. These can be\ndivided into controlled actuator torques (e.g. magnetotor-\nquers, reaction wheels, control moment gyros, etc.) and\nexternal torques (e.g. gravity gradient, aerodynamic, solar\npressure, etc.).\n\n12.3.1 Gravity Gradient\n\nThe gravity gradient torque is a torque that originates from\nthe \u2018dumb bell\u2019 effect on a long thin rotating object [1]. This\ntorque derives from to the finite distance between the\nopposite ends of the spacecraft, with a slight difference in\nthe forces acting on those ends, resulting in a torque about\nthe spacecraft\u2019s center of mass. The gravity gradient torque\nfor a satellites is defined [1, 4] as\n\nNGG \u00bc\n3l\nR5c\n\nRc ? J ?

Solar\nradiation will reflect off the satellite in parts of the space-\ncraft\u2019s orbit and this will create a torque about the space-\ncraft\u2019s center of mass. This torque is defined [1] as\n\nNsp \u00bc F\u00f0Cps ?

Wie et al.\n\n\n\nare two categories of sensors: reference sensors provide a\nreference or a \u2018datum\u2019 of the direction of an object such as\nthe Sun, a planet or a star, even though this could be\ninterrupted by an eclipse; and inertial sensors provide\ncontinuous attitude readings, but due to errors are required\nto have attitude or calibration corrections from reference\nsensors so that the attitude error is kept within an acceptable\ntolerance. Due to the various sensor concepts and con-\nstraints, a combination reference and inertial sensors is used\nfor a spacecraft using a balance of performance, mass/\npower consumption and cost.\n\n12.4.1 Sun Sensors\n\nDetecting the presence and/or the orientation of the Sun\nrelative to the spacecraft is important in most space mis-\nsions. Be it to time the thrust pulses for attitude control, or\nto use the Sun as one of the reference directions for deter-\nmining the spacecraft\u2019s orientation, or simply to maintain\nany sensitive components on-board in the shadow, Sun\nsensors have become routine. The Sun is a luminous body\nand can be approximated as a point source because at\nEarth\u2019s heliocentric distance its arc radius is 0.267?.\nTherefore, it is relatively simple to detect and discriminate\nthe Sun from other stars and planets. As a result, many Sun\nsensors have been manufactured over the years ranging\nfrom basic techniques that simply identify the presence/\nabsence of the Sun, to sophisticated technologies that pin-\npoint the Sun\u2019s direction to the accuracy of several hun-\ndredths of a degree. These sensors can be classified into\nthree basic categories: the Sun presence detector, the analog\nSun sensor, and the digital Sun sensor. The following sec-\ntions briefly explain the operation of these sensors, includ-\ning the hardware involved.\n\n12.4.1.1 Sun Presence Detector\nAs the name indicates, the Sun presence detector outputs a\nsignal when the Sun vector is in its field of observation. The\nconfiguration of the slits and the field of view of a sensor\nvaries for the particular application for which the sensor is\nbeing used. Normally these sensors are used in cases when a\nparticular component on-board is sensitive to Sun and has to\nbe switched ON/OFF relative to the Sun\u2019s presence or\nabsence. For example, equipment such as space telescopes\nand star trackers need to be protected from direct sunlight.\nVarious configurations of Sun-presence sensors have been\ndeveloped [1].\n\n12.4.1.2 Shadow Bar Sun Presence Detector\nThe shadow bar sensor detects the Sun when it is in the\nnarrow field of view zone denoted a in Fig. 12.6, thereby\n\noutputting a signal to the control devices which protect any\nco-located sensitive equipment.\n\n12.4.1.3 Slit Sun Presence Detector\nHere the photocell lies beneath a slit(s) and generates an\noutput signal when the Sun vector lies on the plane of the\nslit(s). Two slit detectors are normally used in spin-stabi-\nlized platforms in order to detect the spin axis of the\nspacecraft. The principle of operation is simple, with a pulse\noutput being generated when the following condition is\nsatisfied.\n\nn ? s \u00bc 0 \u00f012:139\u00de\n\nwhere n is the vector normal to the slit plane and s is the\nSun vector in the frame of the sensor box. As the spacecraft\nspins, the normal vector rotates and Eq. 12.138 traces a\ncosine waveform.\n\n12.4.1.4 V-Slit Sun Presence Detector\nA particular configuration of the Sun sensor called the V-slit\nsensor has been widely used to find the spin axis orientation\nof spin-stabilized spacecraft. A V-slit Sun sensor has two\nslits, the meridian slit parallel to the spin axis and the skew\nslit inclined at an angle i to the spin axis. During each\nrotation of the spacecraft, the Sun vector crosses the plane\nof the meridian slit once and the skew slit once. Denoting\nthe Sun sensor reference frame as [Xsb Ysb Zsb] and the\nspacecraft body frame as [xb yb zb] with zb as the spin-axis,\nthen for the Sun vector to lie within the plane of each of the\ntwo slits, the dot-product of the slit\u2019s normal vector and the\nSun vector must be zero. Hence, the following condition has\nto be satisfied\n\nn1 ? s \u00bc 0 n2 ? s \u00bc 0 \u00f012:140\u00de\n\nwhere n1 and n2 are the vector normal to the slit planes and\ns is the Sun vector in the frame of the sensor box. Fig-\nure 12.7 illustrates the geometry of the two V slits while the\nplot shows the angle between the spin axis and the Sun\nvector as a function of the spin angle with i = 45?.\n\nShaded region \n\nPhoto cells \n\nShaded region \n\nSunlight ?\n\nFig. 12.6 Shadow bar Sun presence detector. Image Malcolm\nMacdonald\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 339\n\n\n\n12.4.1.5 Single and Two Axis Analog Cosine\nSensor\n\nThe basic principle of operation for an analog Sun sensor is\nthat the total energy flux on the surface of the photo cell will\nbe proportional to the cosine of the incidence angle of the\nSun vector. As the current generated from the photo cell\nfollows the cosine law, it is also known as the cosine law\ndetector. Using one photo cell it is possible to compute a\ntwo dimensional representation of the Sun vector, thereby\nmaking it a one axis Sun sensor. A two axis Sun sensor is a\ncombination of two single axis Sun sensors and it gives a\ncomplete three-dimensional representation for the Sun\nvector.\n\nThe basic design for a single axis Sun sensor requires\nonly a single solar cell. To improve the performance,\naccuracy and the linear range of operation, many configu-\nrations of solar cells have been developed, although the\nbasic principle remains the same. The following mathe-\nmatical representation of the single and two axes Sun sensor\ngives a simple method for computation of the Sun vectors\u2019\norientation on-board the spacecraft\n\nI a\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc A cos a\u00f0 \u00de \u00f012:141\u00de\n\nwhere A is a constant that depends on the physical prop-\nerties of the solar cell being used. Therefore, measuring the\noutput current generated and the knowing the properties of\nthe solar cell being used the incident angle a can be com-\nputed; however, the inverse cosine quadrant -90?B a B 0?,\nor 0? C a C 90? cannot be resolved. In order to choose the\ncorrect solution, another solar cell placed with its optical\naxis perpendicular to the first cell to provide another angle b\n\nI b\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc A cos b\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f012:142\u00de\n\nAs discussed in Chap. 10, the cosine law holds well for\nSun angles ranging from 0? to about 50?, beyond which the\nelectrical output deviates significantly from the cosine\nvalue. The actual power versus angle curve is called the\nKelly cosine. The accuracy for the sensor will be less when\nthe angle of incidence is around \u00b190?, i.e. when the Sun\nvector is almost parallel to the photo cell, thereby restricting\nthe operational range. In this case, a lookup table is used to\n\ndetect the angle of incidence, based on ground experimental\ndata, in order to determine the Kelly cosine (Fig. 12.8).\n\n12.4.1.6 Digital Sun Sensor\nThe digital Sun sensors provides higher accuracy than\nanalog Sun sensors. In order to obtain a complete descrip-\ntion of Sun vector orientation, two single axis digital Sun\nsensors with their optical planes at 90? are required. The\ndigital Sun sensor comprises of an optical head and a signal-\nprocessing unit. The optical head has a narrow slit for\nsunlight to pass through and illuminate reticle slits that are\norganized to represent a suitable code such as a gray code or\na binary code. A greater understanding in the choice and\nusage of gray binary code is given in [1, 4]. The encoded\noutput from the reticle slits is decoded in order to obtain the\nSun vector orientation using the signal-processing unit. An\nAutomatic Threshold Adjust (ATA), half the width of the\nother photo cells is used. Therefore, the current generated\nwould be half of any other illuminated slit. The current\ngenerated by the ATA is taken as a reference, to indicate\nwhether any of the other slits are illuminated by the Sun. If\nthe output voltage from any other slit is greater than twice\nthe current generated by the ATA, then the corresponding\nbit is ON, otherwise it is OFF. The Sun vector incident\nangles a and b are computed after the coded bits are con-\nverted in the sensor electronics board.\n\nWith the evolution of Micro Electro-Mechanical System\n(MEMS) technology, miniature sensors using Active Pixel\nSensors (APS) emerged. Photo cell detectors used in these\ndevices can be based on CMOS and CCD technologies.\nA CMOS sensor module is comparatively smaller and has\nless power consumption than a CCD image sensor, although\nthis benefit is at the expense of the image quality. For\nmicrosatellites and nanosatellites where size and mass play\na vital role, CMOS sensors are preferred, not least because\nthey are cheaper (Fig. 12.9).\n\n12.4.2 Earth/Horizon Sensors\n\nThe Earth provides a reference direction for determining the\nrelative attitude of a spacecraft.

It is sufficiently easy to \u2018see\u2019 the Earth from\nthe spacecraft through a wide range of spectral bands.\nHowever, in order for the sensor to differentiate Earth from\ncold space all along the orbit, the radiance emitted should\nhave a uniform energy distribution over a range of the\nspectrum. The Earth\u2019s albedo lies mostly in the visible\nspectral range, and it varies widely depending on the\nreflecting surface (ice, snow, forest, water, soil, etc.) and on\nthe time of the day/year, therefore causing ambiguity in the\nmeasurements. A spectral region that better matches the\nrequirements is the infrared region. The spectral range of 14\nto 16 lm (the CO2 band) is used by most horizon sensors\nbecause the energy emitted has a uniform energy distribu-\ntion irrespective of the day/night terminator and the Earth\u2019s\nreflecting surface as a result of most of the radiation being\nfrom the atmosphere above the Earth\u2019s surface [25, 26].\n\n12.4.2.1 Principle of Operation of an Earth Sensor\nAn Earth sensor normally operates by scanning the sky to\ndetect the Earth\u2019s horizon. It has an optical system detector,\nalong with a signal-processing unit. If the Earth sensor is on\n\na spin-stabilized platform, then as the spacecraft spins the\nsensor can scan the sky to detect for infrared radiation\nemitted by the Earth. Otherwise, the sensor is provided with\na steerable scanning mechanism in order to scan the sky.\nThe basic components of an Earth horizon sensor are shown\nin Fig. 12.10.\n\nThe detector normally is a bolometer whose resistance\nvaries depending on the incident radiation. Thereby, when\nthe Earth is in the field of view of the sensor, the bolometer\nhas a certain value of resistance and at other times the\nbolometer has a different resistance value. Other detectors\nthat are useful include the photodiode (sensitivity mainly in\nthe near-infrared region), pyroelectric devices, and a ther-\nmopile. The sensitivity of these detectors to the incident\nradiation primarily decides the accuracy of the Earth sen-\nsor. As the sensor works, basically, by detecting the hori-\nzon of the Earth it is also called the horizon sensor. The\nEarth sensor on-board the spacecraft traces out the base of\na cone, Fig. 12.11 shows the geometry of the scan and the\nscan path on Earth.\n\nThe STD 15 EADS Sodern sensor is shown in\nFig. 12.12, which is used to measure pitch and roll angles. It\nhas a dual-track scanning pattern, hence rather than scan-\nning a simple cone as shown in Fig. 12.11, it scans a shape\nakin to a cartoon bone, allowing it to measure pitch and roll\nangles at altitude between 15,000 and 140,000 km, with an\noperating nominal de-pointing pitch range of \u00b112?\n(roll = 0?) and a roll range of \u00b12.9? (pitch = 0?). With an\naccuracy budget 3r, bias amounts to 0.035? and the typical\nnoise to 0.015? [26].\n\n12.4.3 Star Sensors\n\nStar cameras can provide accurate, absolute attitude infor-\nmation by imaging stars and matching them to catalog posi-\ntions. They provide the most accurate attitude information of\nall satellite sensors\u2014an estimated accuracy of 20 arc seconds\nor less is typical. A star camera\u2019s performance depends on its\nability to detect dim light sources, and the attitude accuracy\nimproves with the number of stars that can be detected. CCD\ndevices are usually used for imaging (as opposed to CMOS\nimaging devices) because they are more sensitive to the\nincoming photons. Star trackers have large apertures to allow\nas much light as possible to enter the lens, and make use of\nbaffles to suppress stray light from the Sun or light reflected\nfrom the Earth or Moon. A star camera can be used in both the\neclipse and daylight portions of the orbit as long as the bore-\nsight points away from these bright objects. The imaging\ndevices used in star camera are susceptible to radiation\neffects. Radiation particles will typically damage pixels on\nthe sensor, progressively reducing its star detection capabil-\nities over time (Fig. 12.13).\n\nFig. 12.8 Coarse analog cosine Sun sensor (top) and a fine, or two-\naxis analog cosine Sun sensor (bottom), both developed by Moog\nBradford\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 341\n\n\n\n12.4.3.1 Attitude Determination from Matched\nStar Vectors\n\nReference star positions are obtained from a catalog, such as\nthe Hipparcos and Bright Star Catalog (BSC). Detected\nstars are matched to catalog stars by finding pairs of stars\nwith the same angular separation and the same apparent\nmagnitude. A matching tolerance is used to allow for\ndetection variations. Multiple pairs of catalog stars may be\nmatched with a detected pair. These matches are then fur-\nther pruned using a constellation matching algorithm [27].\n\n12.4.3.2 Performance, Attitude Accuracy\nand Limitations\n\nThe number of stars that can be detected will depend on the\ncamera\u2019s ability to discern brighter pixels from \u2018dark\u2019 pix-\nels. Factors that influence this include the amount of light\nentering the optics and falling on the sensor, the noise\ncharacteristics of the sensor and readout electronics, the\n\nFig. 12.9 LISA Pathfinder\ndigital Sun sensor flight model,\nincluding removable alignment\ncube (left).

Wie et al.\n\n\n\nintegration time of the sensor, and the suppression of stray\nlight reflected in the optics. Star brightness is measured on a\nlogarithmic scale, with negative numbers being very bright\nand larger positive numbers having less brightness. The\nhuman eye can discern stars as faint as magnitude 6.0 against\na dark sky, but optical aid is needed for dimmer stars. Like-\nwise, a star tracker will have a cut-off magnitude where\ndimmer stars are no longer detectable. For the star tracker to\nbe able to operate for all possible orientations, it should be\nable to detect enough stars in its field of view for any given\norientation. Light from bright objects like the Sun or Earth\ncan influence the detection capabilities even if they do not\nappear in the star tracker\u2019s field of view. Stray light can still\nenter the optics at an angle and internal reflections can cause\nthese rays to fall on the sensor, raising the average \u2018dark\u2019 level\nand effectively washing out the dimmer stars. Most star\ncameras have large baffles\u2014cones with rings on the inside\u2014\nthat prevent stray light from entering the optics.\n\nThe star-magnitude detection threshold can be improved\nby allowing the sensor to integrate for longer. That way,\nmore light is accumulated and a better signal-to-noise ratio\nis achieved. However, a longer integration time has its\ndrawbacks. Firstly, a longer integration time implies a\nslower update rate. But more importantly, a longer inte-\ngration time will only be helpful if the spacecraft is fixed\nwith respect to the stars. A rotating star tracker will result in\nlight from a single star \u2018smearing\u2019 over multiple pixels.\nMost star trackers will specify a maximum rotation rate at\nwhich it can operate (typically 5 degrees per second). For\nlarger angular rates the smear will be spread out over too\nmany pixels for detection to be possible.\n\nThe time that it takes a star camera to detect and match\nstars can be shortened if prior information about the attitude is\nknown. For this reason, most star cameras incorporate a\n\u2018tracking\u2019 mode where previously detected and matched stars\nare tracked over small displacements. In the initial acquisi-\ntion phase, when no attitude information is available, the\nentire catalog is searched for possible matches, but once\nmatches have been established and an attitude estimate is\navailable, this estimate can be used in subsequent iterations to\nlimit the number of catalog stars that have to be searched. The\nresult is a faster update rate. The attitude estimated by the star\n\ntracker can be represented as an azimuth and elevation angle\n(X and Y), and a rotation around the camera\u2019s bore-sight (Z).\nBecause all the measured vectors from the star tracker will be\nfound inside a cone around the camera\u2019s bore-sight, the\naccuracy of the rotation angle around the bore-sight will be\nless than the azimuth and elevation accuracy. This effect will\nbecome more pronounced as the field of view is made\nsmaller. To compensate for this, some star trackers have the\nability to fit more than one camera head unit. The highest\naccuracy will be obtained if two camera head units are per-\npendicular. Adding more cameras will also increase redun-\ndancy in case of failure, and increase the availability of stars\n(in case one of the cameras is blinded by stray light).\n\n12.4.4 Magnetometers\n\nMagnetometers have become one of the most commonly\nused attitude determination sensors for satellites in LEO.\nThis is primarily due to their simplicity, robustness, low cost,\nand small mass. They are used to measure the strength and\ndirection of the local magnetic field. When this information is\ncombined with a model of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field such as\nthe International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF)\nmodel, the attitude of the satellite can be determined. How-\never, because the field is not well mapped and has many\nanomalies, magnetometers can only provide coarse mea-\nsurements and they are usually combined with other sensors\nsuch as star cameras and Sun sensors. Magnetometers are\nextensively used in the de-tumbling phase of the satellite\nwhen magnetorquers are used for that purpose. The firing of\nthe magnetorquers must be timed so as to allow the magnetic\nfield to break down before any readings are taken. Special\nconsideration needs to be taken as to the placement of the\nmagnetometer. It must be placed away from any sources that\nmight cause noise. For this reason, they are often placed at the\nend of extensible booms. The most common type of mag-\nnetometer for attitude determination purposes is the fluxgate\nmagnetometer. These usually have a sensitivity of \u00b110 nT\nwith a range of \u00b160 lT. They tend to have an accuracy of\nbetween 0.5 and 5? and are only usable for altitudes below\napproximately 6,000 km [28].\n\nFig. 12.13 Star camera\nschematic (left) and the star\ntracker from the Kepler\nspacecraft (right). Image Ball\nAerospace (right)\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 343\n\n\n\n12.4.5 Rate Gyros\n\nSpinning gyros are one of the oldest and most popular\nsensors used on-board satellites and aerospace vehicles.\nGyros can measure the angular rates of a vehicle without\nneeding any knowledge of an external or absolute reference.\nThus, if the attitude of a spacecraft is determined with an\nEarth or Sun sensor, then the angular rates of the satellite\u2019s\nprincipal axes can be obtained by differentiating the angular\nposition outputs of the sensors. However, if the spacecraft\nenters an eclipse where this will no longer be possible,\ncontinued control will require the use of the gyro-rate\nsensors to measure the satellite\u2019s attitude. Another reason\nfor using gyro-rate sensors is the need to control the angular\nrate of a spacecraft in addition to its angular position.\nDifferentiating angular position outputs of a satellite from\nother sensors in order to get the angular rates can lead to\nnoisy results, which will affect the stability and pointing of\nthe ADCS system.\n\nA gyro consists of a spinning wheel that reacts and\nmeasures imposed attitude rotations of a vehicle. The most\ncommon types of gyro are the rate-gyro (RG) and the rate-\nintegrating gyro (RIG), which are based on the gyroscopic\nstiffness of revolving moments of inertia. The biggest dis-\nadvantage of a gyro is its reliance on moving parts, which\nhave a limited lifetime. However, advances in mechanics,\nmicroelectronics and space components have contributed to\nthe development of sensors based on new physical concepts\ninvolving no moving parts, such as laser gyros, quartz rate\nsensors, MEMS sensors, fiber optic gyros (FOG), and\nhemispherical resonator gyros (HRG).\n\nIn order to be able to understand and compare rate gyros\nwhich come with inherit noise problems, various design and\nperformance parameters are defined\n\n\u2022 Range\u2014The larger the range of measurement, the larger\nthe noise level of the sensor. The smaller the range, the\nbetter the accuracy; ranges of 1\u2013100?/s are feasible.\n\n\u2022 Bias (drift)\u2014The most important characteristic of a gyro\nand intrinsic to the technology, ranging from 0.01 to 1?/hr.\n\n\u2022 Output noise\u2014Specified per frequency band.\n\u2022 Scale factor\u2014Important for rate integration and has a\n\nstrong influence on the achievable attitude accuracy.\n\nGyros are commonly used in clusters, one per axis plus a\nfourth unit in a skewed configuration for redundancy, but it\nis also possible to have all four off-axis in order to maxi-\nmize redundancy. This particular configuration is also\ncalled an inertial reference unit (IRU). The combination of\ngyros and accelerometers can give addition position/veloc-\nity measurements, and this is called an inertial measurement\nunit (IMU).\n\n12.4.6 Global Navigation Satellite System/\nGlobal Positioning System\n\nGlobal navigation satellite system (GNSS)/Global Posi-\ntioning System (GPS) signals can be used both for orbit\ndetermination (position) and for attitude determination\nusing multiple antenna layouts. A set of antennas is used,\nconnected to a GPS receiver on the top panel of a spacecraft\nin LEO, facing the GNSS constellations in MEO. Using the\nphase difference between the antennas allows a recon-\nstruction of the attitude of the spacecraft. Despite various\ntechnical issues such as multipath and noise, accuracies of\n0.1? to 1? have been achieved [29, 30].\n\n12.5 Attitude Control Actuators\n\nActuators can be divided into inertial and non-inertial types.\nInertial actuators are devices that generate torques, by\nmodifying their angular momentum. They include\n\u2022 Momentum wheels (MW)\u2014They provide constant angu-\n\nlar momentum for gyroscopic stabilization. Orientation of\nthe spin axis is fixed with respect to inertial space. Atti-\ntude control is achieved by varying the spin speed of the\nwheel about some nominal value.\n\n\u2022 Reaction wheels (RW)\u2014They provide torque to a vehicle\nby increasing or decreasing the speed of the wheel, with\nthe wheel nominally at rest.\n\n\u2022 Control moment gyroscopes (CMG)\u2014A momentum wheel\ngimbaled in one or two axes. Control torques are generated\nby changing the direction of the spinning wheel\u2019s axis to\nvary the direction of the momentum vector.\nNon-inertial actuators are\n\n\u2022 Magnetic torquers (MT)\u2014Magnetic coils or electro-\nmagnets that generate magnetic dipole moments. A\nmagnetic torquer produces a torque proportional (and\nperpendicular) to the Earth\u2019s magnetic field. It is often\nused as a secondary actuator on a spacecraft in order to\nde-saturate momentum exchange systems, although it has\nbecome a common primary system on CubeSats and\nother resource-limited spacecraft.\n\n\u2022 Thrusters\u2014Produce a thrust (force) or torque around the\ncenter of mass by expelling propellant.\nAnother means of applying attitude control actuation is\n\nto manipulate the attitude disturbance torques in a favorable\nway. The most common of these techniques is to use solar\nradiation pressure for attitude control on GEO platforms,\nwhere a reflective trim tab is often used to aid attitude\ncontrol and reduce propellant consumption. It is noteworthy\nthat the same method was used on the Mariner-10 space-\ncraft to Mercury and Venus, and on the MESSENGER\n\n344 B. Wie et al.\n\n\n\nprobe to Mercury, which used solar radiation pressure on\ntheir solar panels to perform fine trajectory corrections. The\nJapanese Hayabusa spacecraft also used solar radiation\npressure for attitude control in a recovery mode after the\nfailure of its on-board reaction wheels. The manipulation of\nattitude disturbance torques to aid attitude control will not\nbe discussed further here.\n\n12.5.1 Momentum/Reaction Wheels\n\nMomentum/reaction wheel (MW/RW) systems operate on\nthe principle of conservation of angular momentum. Using\nrotating masses in a spacecraft\u2019s body allows the transfer of\nangular momentum between different parts of the vehicle\nwithout changing its overall angular momentum. Inside a\nspacecraft, a symmetrical rotating body produces angular\ntorque when accelerated about its axis of rotation. The\nrotating body may have an initial constant angular\nmomentum (spinning flywheel). As this momentum is\ninternal to the spacecraft, its increase does not change the\ntotal momentum of the system but rather transfers the\nmomentum to the spacecraft.\n\nThe ratio between the satellite and flywheel inertia is\nselected such that it fulfills the attitude control (agility)\nrequirements of a specific mission, taking into consider-\nation, mass, volume and power constraints for the actuators\nto be used on a satellite. Sections 12.1.2 and 12.1.5 detail\nthe mathematical models used for spacecraft using attitude\ncontrol actuators.\n\nA view of typical wheels is shown in Fig. 12.14. They\nconsist of a precision engineered flywheel with most of the\nmass concentrated at the tip/rim of the disk to achieve\nmaximum wheel inertia for a given mass. A brushless DC\nmotor is usually used to rotate the wheel. The complete\nwheel assembly with integrated electronics is housed in a\ncage. This cage has a two-fold task; it helps to protect the\n\nspacecraft in case something goes wrong with the spinning\nwheel, and it also sometimes acts as a pressure vessel to\nkeep the lubricant from outgassing. The bearing assembly,\nwhich is required for mechanical support and operations, is\nwhat limits the lifetime of reaction wheels to about\n5\u201315 years, depending on the duty cycle of the wheel, the\ntype of lubrication used, and the motor technology. The\ndesign of miniature, low-cost and low-jitter MW/RW with\nlonger lifetimes has continued in parallel with new\nmechanical and mechatronic developments.\n\nReaction wheels are used when accurate time-optimal\nrapid maneuvers are required. They allow continuous and\nsmooth control of torque, can accelerate in both directions,\nand normally have a zero speed. However, due to friction\nthey display a non-linear response at very low spin rates that\nmight cause an irregular motion of the spacecraft. This is\nusually solved by running the wheel with a small bias.\n\nMomentum wheels are essentially the same as reaction\nwheels but have a large nominal spin rate. This provides a\nconstant angular momentum that causes gyroscopic stiffness\naround two axes that helps to maintain the attitude of the\nspacecraft.\n\nAs previously stated, a minimum of three non-copla-\nnar wheels are required for full three axis control. In\norder to avoid single-point failure, a fourth wheel is\nusually added in a skewed configuration, but it is also\npossible to have all four off-axis in order to maximize\nredundancy. Due to the addition of a fourth wheel, which\nis usually added at an equal angle with the other three\nwheels, additional torque and momentum authority may\nbe required.\n\nThe wheels need to be properly sized so as not to become\nsaturated by the expected worst-case disturbance torques.\nWhen momentum builds up, external torque actuators such\nas magnetorquers or thrusters are required to dump some of\nthe momentum. The torque capability of the reaction wheels\nis determined by the desired slew rates.\n\nFig. 12.14 Reaction/\nmomentum wheels.

They\nare considered to be \u2018torque amplifiers\u2019 because they can use\nthe stored angular momentum in a flywheel and \u2018convert\u2019 it to\nlarge torques by gimballing the flywheel appropriately.\n\nA CMG consists of two parts\n\u2022 The momentum wheel, which produces a large and\n\nconstant angular momentum (magnitude).\n\u2022 The gimbal motor (or set of gimbal motors) on which the\n\nmomentum wheel is mounted, so that the angular\nmomentum vector of the wheel can be changed to the\ndesired direction.\nAs shown in Fig. 12.15, torquing the gimbal results in a\n\nprecessional torque that is normal to the gimbal axis and\nspin axis of the momentum wheel\n\nNCMG \u00bc h? _d \u00f012:143\u00de\n\nwhere h is the angular momentum vector and _d is the\ngimbal rate.\n\nDepending on the mechanical characteristics, CMGs can\nbe characterized as\n\u2022 Single-gimbal CMGs (SGCMG)\u2014The momentum wheel\n\nis gimbaled in one axis and constrained to rotate on a\ncircle in a plane that is normal to the gimbal axis.\n\n\u2022 Double-gimbal CMGs (DGCMG)\u2014The momentum\nwheel is constrained inside two gimbals and the angular\nmomentum vector is oriented within a sphere.\n\n\u2022 Variable-speed CMGs: SGCMG\u2014A variable speed\nmomentum wheel provides an extra degree of control\nthan is available to SGCMGs.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of each is summa-\n\nrized in Table 12.2.\nMost CMGs are used on large spacecraft, principally due\n\nto their high angular momentum storage capability, which\nprovides increased stabilization under large external dis-\nturbance torques. CMGs can also produce substantial tor-\nques and are very heavy (typically 55\u2013150 kg for\n300\u20131,000 Nms momenta and 100\u20131,000 Nm output tor-\nques [8]). Recently, Astrium and Honeywell have begun to\nwork on smaller CMGs (see Table 12.3), for new families\nof spacecraft in the 500\u20132,000 kg range that require high\nprecision pointing and fast slew capabilities [5, 31, 32].\n\nThe Skylab and Mir space stations both used CMGs for\nattitude control and stability, as does the International Space\nStation (ISS). Skylab used a cluster of DGCMGs, while Mir\nhad a cluster of six SGCMGs with only four being used at a\ntime. The ISS uses four DGCMGs in a boxed configuration.\nOne of the ISS CMGs suffered a bearing failure in 2002,\nleaving the space station with two primary gyroscopes and\none spare. That spare shut down in 2004 when a circuit\n\nbreaker failed. Though subsequently repaired, it failed again\nin March 2005. When power was rerouted during a space-\nwalk, this restored it to operation [33] (Fig. 12.16).\n\nHoneywell is the biggest manufacturer of CMGs and\nthey are used in a large number of spacecraft [5, 34]. The\ncompany has developed the M-50 CMG for agile satellites\nin the 1,000\u20132,000 kg class for Earth observation [34]. The\nM-50 has flown on two spacecraft, the Ball Aerospace\nWorldview-1 and -2, together with Quickbird form Digi-\ntalGlobe\u2019s constellation of commercial remote sensing sat-\nellites. The more recent spacecraft, Worldview-2 was\nlaunched in 2009. It is a very agile platform providing re-\ntargeting capability with an acceleration of 1.5?/s2,with a\nslew rate of 3.5?/s and a time to slew 200 km is 10 s for a\n2,800 kg spacecraft with 0.5 m panchromatic, 2 m multi-\nspectral imaging capability.\n\nAstrium is also building a CMG based on a Teldix RW.\nThe compact CMG has been designed for the French Ple-\niades spacecraft, currently in orbit and a new platform in the\n1 ton class designed for agile, high resolution imaging in a\nconstellation of imaging (provided by France) and radar\n(provided by Italy) spacecraft [35].\n\nOn the other end of the performance spectrum, a twin\nmicro-CMG payload was designed and built by the Uni-\nversity of Surrey and SSTL for the Turkish BILSAT-1\nimaging microsatellite flown in 2002, demonstrating that\nagility with the implementation of low cost micro-CMGs\nbased on COTS is feasible [8, 31, 36].\n\n12.5.3 Magnetorquers/Magnetic Control\n\nMagnetic control has been used in many space missions.\nThe simplicity, inexpensive hardware and reasonably good\nattitude control (0.5? to 5? in all axes) makes magnetic\ncontrol very attractive, especially for small satellites pri-\nmarily for attitude control and momentum dumping of\nreaction/momentum wheels on small satellites.\n\nWheel momentum, h \n\nGimbal axis\ng\n\nOutput torque, NCMG \n\nFig. 12.15 Single-gimbal CMG diagram\n\n346 B. Wie et al.\n\n\n\nInteraction between a magnetic moment, M, generated\nby a spacecraft with the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, B, produces\na control torque NM acting on the spacecraft\n\nNM \u00bcM? B: \u00f012:144\u00de\n\nThe direction of M can be controlled on average by a\nproper sequence of magnetorquers firings, but the B field\nvector is dependent on the orbital location. As a result, the\ntorque NM, which always is orthogonal to B and M, is not\nnecessarily favorable for control of the attitude of a specific\nspacecraft axis in certain regions of the orbit. Another\ndrawback of magnetorquers is that it is possible that a\ndesirable control torque for a certain attitude axis (pitch,\nroll, yaw) might generate undesirable disturbance torques\nfor the other axes. The Earth\u2019s magnetic field is predomi-\nnately a magnetic dipole. The magnetic field can be\nexpressed mathematically by a spherical harmonic model,\nthe so-called IGRF (International Geomagnetic Reference\nField) model. For purposes of simulation, a first-order\ndipole model is often used to represent the geomagnetic\nfield vector. This dipole vector is expressed as\n\nB \u00bc r R\nTMe\nR3s\n\n? ?\n\u00bc 1? 3RRT\n? ?Me\n\nR3s\n\u00f012:145\u00de\n\nwhere r is the vector gradient operator, Rs is the length of\nthe geocentric position vector, R is the unit geocentric\nposition vector, Me is the geomagnetic strength of the\ndipole vector, and 1 is the identity matrix.\n\nMagnetorquers can produce a torque based on the mag-\nnetic moment that it can produce, which depends on the\nnumber of coil windings n, the cross-sectional area A of the\ncoil, and on the amount of current I that passes through the\ncoil in the unit vector along the coil\u2019s axis u\n\nTable 12.2 Advantages and disadvantages of different CMG types\n\nCMG type Advantage Disadvantage\n\nSGCMG Great torque amplification Singularities\n\nDGCMG Torque amplification, extra degree of freedom Cost, complexity, size\n\nVSCMG Extra degree of control Enhanced control\n\nTable 12.3 CMGs with flight heritage\n\nYear Manufacturer Type of CMG Torque Momentum Mass (Kg)\n\n1973 Bendix (Skylab) 3 DGCMGs N/A 2,700 Nms 200\n\n1976 Honeywell 4-6 SGCMGs [150 Nm [100 Nm [30\n\n1986 MIR 4-6 SGCMGs N/A N/A N/A\n\n2001 L-3 (ISS) 4 DGCMG 258 Nm 4,760 Nms 272\n\n1999 Honeywell (M50) SGCMG 85 Nm 25\u201375 Nms 28\n\n1999 Pleiades (Astrium) SGCMG 45 Nm 15 Nms 15.7\n\n2002 SSC/SSTL SGCMG 50 mNm 0.28 Nms 2\n\n2007/2009 WorldView-1 & 2 SGCMG 85 Nm 25\u201375 28\n\nFig. 12.16 Boeing technicians remove the cover from a Control\nMoment Gyroscope (CMG) in the Space Station Processing Facility at\nKennedy Space Centre (top) and astronaut Dave Williams, STS-118\nmission specialist, anchored to the foot restraint on the Canadarm2\nremoving a faulty control moment gyroscope (CMG-3) and installing a\nnew CMG into the station\u2019s Z1 truss (bottom).

B\u00f0 \u00de : \u00f012:147\u00de\n\nUsually, three magnetorquers are used on a spacecraft,\none per axis for coarse attitude control and mainly for\nangular momentum unloading. Their utility decreases with\nincreasingly altitude due to the decreasing strength of the\nmagnetic field. The field\u2019s strength and direction also var-\nies. A specific feature of magnetorquers is that they cannot\nproduce a torque component about the local field direction.\nFor example, in a polar orbit any required direction can\nalways be achieved at some point in the orbit since the field\ndirection changes round the orbit, whereas in the equatorial\nplane this would be problematic because the field lines are\nalways in a north\u2013south direction. Magnetorquers do not\nrequire any propellant, require very limited power levels,\nand have an unlimited lifetime, as well as no moving parts.\nTherefore, they are very popular, simple to manufacture and\ninexpensive actuators.\n\n12.5.4 Thrusters\n\nExternal disturbances acting on satellite can be countered\nby using small thrusters, thus controlling the total\nmomentum of the spacecraft. They are mounted in clusters\non the surfaces of a satellite in various configurations in\norder to provide the required direction of torque about each\naxis. The disadvantages of using a thruster, especially when\ncompared to magnetorquers is the consumption of propel-\nlant, increased mass, complexity and cost. However, using\nthrusters is independent of altitude and of the Earth\u2019s\nmagnetic field, and they can be used for fine/precise attitude\ncontrol, station-keeping of GEO satellites and as an orbit\ncontrol system in many cases.\n\nEurope\u2019s Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) built by\nEADS Astrium for ESA is an automated robotic tug that\ntransports cargo to the ISS using an autonomous ranging\nand rendezvous system which requires very fine and precise\nattitude control. The ATV, which has a mass of 20,750 kg\nat launch, and uses twenty-eight 220 N bipropellant\nthrusters for attitude control. Figure 12.17 shows the ATV\nwith four clusters of two thrusters and four clusters of five\nthrusters [37].\n\n12.5.5 ADCS Heritage Design Case Studies\n\n12.5.5.1 Earth Observation Small Satellites\nUoSAT-12 is a low-cost minisatellite built by Surrey\nSatellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL), and amongst other\n\nobjectives it is a technology demonstrator for high perfor-\nmance attitude control and orbit maintenance on a future\nconstellation of Earth observation satellites. The satellite\nuses a 3-axis reaction wheel configuration and a cold gas\npropulsion system to enable precise and fast control of its\nattitude, for example during orbit maneuvers. Magnetorquer\ncoils assist the wheels mainly for momentum dumping. This\nsection describes the various attitude control modes\nrequired to support: (1) the initial attitude acquisition phase,\n(2) a high-resolution imager payload during pointing and\ntracking of targets, and (3) the propulsion system during\norbit maneuvers.\n\nUoSAT-12 supports a wide range of sensors for attitude\ndetermination and a multi-channel GPS receiver for on-\nboard orbit determination and accurate time synchroniza-\ntion. The GPS receiver also has an experimental attitude\ndetermination capability, through baseline sensing of an\narray of five patch antennas. A redundant set of three 3-axis\nfluxgate magnetometers are used to measure the geomag-\nnetic field vector in the satellite\u2019s body coordinates. These\nmeasurements are used to determine the magnetic coil\ntorque vector and in combination with a magnetic field\nmodel to estimate the full attitude and angular rates of the\nsatellite. Four 2-axis (azimuth and elevation) Sun sensors\nmeasure the Sun vector angle to high accuracy. During the\nnominal nadir pointing attitude mode, small pitch and roll\nangles can be measured with a 2-axis infrared horizon\nsensor. The highest attitude measurement accuracy is\nobtained from a dual set of opposite looking star sensors.\nThe sensors supply star measurement vectors and matched\nstar catalog vectors at a rate of once per second to an atti-\ntude and rate estimation filter. A solid-state angular rate\nsensor is mounted in one axis of the satellite to flight qualify\nthe sensor for future missions. Table 12.4 lists all the sen-\nsors used on UoSAT-12 for attitude determination and their\nmost important characteristics.\n\nTwelve magnetorquer coils are positioned within the\nsatellite to give some level of redundancy and to deliver full\n3-axis magnetic dipole moment control. These coils are\ncontrolled using dual polarity current pulse width control in\norder to deliver the required averaged level of magnetic\nmoment per sample period. The magnetorquers are used for\n\u2022 De-tumbling of body angular rates after launch\n\u2022 Momentum dumping of the reaction wheels\n\u2022 Momentum maintenance on the momentum wheel during\n\nY-spin stabilization\n\u2022 Nutation damping during spin stabilization\n\u2022 Libration damping and yaw spin/phase control after\n\ndeployment of a backup gravity gradient boom.\nThree momentum/reaction wheel subassemblies are\n\nmounted in a 3-axis configuration to enable full control of\nthe attitude or angular momentum of the satellite. One\nwheel is a space qualified wheel from Ithaco and is mounted\n\n348 B. Wie et al.\n\n\n\nin the structural Y-axis direction in order to have higher\nreliability when the pitch momentum bias control mode is\nused. The-SSTL manufactured wheels, destined to be space\nqualified on UoSAT-12, are mounted in the structural X and\nZ-axis directions. The wheels are used for the following\ncontrol functions\n\u2022 Full 3-axis pointing and slow slew maneuvers during\n\nimaging\n\u2022 Nadir, Sun or inertial pointing of the payloads by using\n\nangular momentum stiffening\n\u2022 Near minimum-time Euler-axis rotations for quick atti-\n\ntude maneuvers\n\u2022 Fast spin-up or spin-down of the satellite body e.g. bar-\n\nbecue mode of the solar arrays\n\u2022 Cancelation of the disturbance torque caused by the\n\npropulsion system during orbit control\n\u2022 Thruster and moment of inertia calibration.\n\nUoSAT-12 is fitted with a single nitrous oxide (N2O)\nresistojet thruster (see Chap. 11) for orbit maintenance and\nten cold gas nitrogen thrusters for orbit or attitude control.\nThe resistojet is aligned to the center of mass of the satellite.\nSome cold gas thrusters can be used in pairs to limit the\n\nattitude disturbance torque during orbit control maneuvers.\nThe propulsion system can be used for the following\nfunctions\n\u2022 Full 3-axis rough pointing and fast slew control\n\u2022 Drag compensation of the satellite\u2019s orbit\n\u2022 Orbit shaping to demonstrate constellation control\n\u2022 Wheel momentum dumping/maintenance.\n\nTable 12.5 lists the various actuators used on UoSAT-12\nfor attitude and orbit control and their respective\ncharacteristics.\n\nUoSAT-12 was launched on April 21, 1999, from the\nBaikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan into a 650 km cir-\ncular orbit at 65? inclination. The initial telemetry of the\nmagnetometer indicated a tumbling rate of about 2?/s. The\nnext day the ADCS software was loaded on the 186-OBC\n(on-board computer) and the Rate Kalman filter confirmed\nthe initial tumbling rate to be mainly around the Y-axis.\nThis result confirmed the slightly higher Y-axis moment of\ninertia and the cross-products of inertia that had been pre-\ndicted pre-launch. Initially only the Y-axis magnetorquer\nwas used to dump the X and Z-axis angular rates, then the\nX-axis magnetorquer was enabled to control the Y-axis rate\n\nFig. 12.17 Automated transfer\nvehicle (ATV), with 220 N\nthruster clusters shown forward\nand aft (top left) and a five\nthruster cluster (top right).

After two\norbits, the body angular momentum of UoSAT-12 was\nalmost completely dumped. The magnetorquer controller\nwas left running for two more orbits until the satellite was in\nthe required Y-Thomson attitude. The cross-products of\ninertia prevented the satellite from reaching the target rate\nexactly, and the true Y-rate estimated was approximately -\n0.8?/s with small residual X and Z-rates of less than 0.2?/s.\n\nFollowing transition to nadir-pointing, the ADCS system\nwas put in zero momentum mode. The pitch and roll\npointing errors experienced were very small, the 1-r devi-\nation is 0.13? and the maximum peaks during this period are\nless than 0.5?. The yaw error was worse (1-s deviation is\n0.62?) due to a lack of accurate yaw information close to the\npolar region and the use of the magnetometer as the only\nsource of yaw information to the EKF estimator. Yaw\ncontrol peaks of 3? were experienced for short periods at the\nmaximum latitude extremes of each orbit. The reaction\nwheels were running mostly below 20 rpm and the magn-\netorquer peaks were 2.5 % of the saturation limit. The\nmagnetorquers are being used exclusively to dump any\nwheel momentum build-up.\n\n12.5.5.2 GEO Satellite Case Study\nThe Eurostar family has been a very successful platform for\nGEO satellites built by EADS Astrium. This section pre-\nsents the architecture of the Eurostar 3000 AOCS system\nflown on the CNES Stentor (Satellite de T\u00e9l\u00e9communica-\ntions pour Exp\u00e9rimenter les Nouvelles Technologies en\nOrbite), Amamzonas-2, Arabsat 5A/C, Interlsat-10, Hotbird\n10, YahSat 1A/1B missions and many others (Fig. 12.18).\n\nThe Eurostar 3000 AOCS was designed by Matra Mar-\nconi Space (now Astrium) based on the successful Eurostar\n2000? AOCS concept and hardware with a focus on per-\nformance enhancement and reducing operational workload.\nThe AOCS system was designed to be scalable for medium\nto very large GEO platforms. The AOCS system was vali-\ndated in the CNES STENTOR mission flown in 2002.\nHeritage for the Eurostar 3000 AOCS system was also\ndrawn from the Eurostar 1000/2000 AOCS, including the\nuse of solar radiation pressure for smooth roll/yaw attitude\ncontrol through the modulation of solar radiation pressure\nusing fixed patented flaps on the solar arrays. With the use of\nelectric propulsion (EP) the AOCS system achieved\nimproved pointing stability.

The solar arrays equipped with flaps\nproduce long-term inertial torques through the offset of each\nwing with respect to the Sun direction.\n\nThe AOCS subsystem is based on full redundancy. A\nhierarchical failure, detection, isolation and recovery\n(FDIR) is used to maintain the telecommunications mission\nin case of anomaly while limiting ground intervention.\n\nThe transfer and acquisition phase which is inherited\nfrom the Eurostar 2000+ sequence is based on 3-axis con-\ntrol. For the Eurostar 3000 an improved design is utilized\nallowing for simpler operations without any loss on safety.\nIn the transfer phase, in which solar arrays are partially\ndeployed, all operations from launcher separation to the end\nof the apogee sequence are included. In this phase only Sun\nand Earth acquisition is used to reach 3-axis pointing. The\npointing information is then used for gyro stabilization in\norder to perform the LAE firing, but does not require any\nknowledge of the gyro scale factors.\n\nWhen on-station, the attitude is based on a wheel system\nwith two degrees of freedom, which deviates from the\nmomentum bias system used on Eurostar 2000+. Here the\nsolar radiation pressure mode is used exclusively for long-\nterm wheel unloading. For large GEO satellites, it is not\neasy to separate the short-term/long-term movements due to\n\nthe nutation frequency. Thus, a robust momentum/control\ndesign is implemented for global large band control\nextending the bandwidth of the control.\n\nAnother innovation of the Eurostar 3000 AOCS system\nwas the ability to provide gyroless yaw estimation during\nthe EP station-keeping phase based on Earth and Sun sensor\nmeasurements.\n\n12.6 Orbital Guidance, Navigation\nand Control Systems\n\nThis section is devoted to the guidance, navigation, and\ncontrol (GNC) of the motion of the spacecraft center of\nmass. The focus is on GNC systems for on-board autono-\nmous operations. The analogous problem for the spacecraft\norientation was described in the previous sections. The\ntypical functional architecture of the AOCS presented in\nFig. 12.1 assumes separate navigation chains for determi-\nnation of attitude and orbital motion. This architecture\nshows the typical data flow within the GNC system and its\ninterfaces with the other functions of the AOCS.\n\nThe decoupling of GNC and ADCS is quite convenient\nfor analysis and design. Some examples of missions with\nseparated GNC and ADCS systems are NASA\u2019s Deep\nSpace-1 [1] and Deep Impact [2] and JAXA\u2019s Hayabusa [3].\nThe interactions between ADCS and GNC will be presented\nin the application examples. It is worth noting that in some\nreferences (often dealing with highly autonomous systems)\nthe orbit and attitude control system is referred to as the\nGNC system.\n\nThe on-board GNC system is responsible of the fol-\nlowing tasks [4, 5]\n\u2022 Navigation determines the present state with the required\n\naccuracy.\n\u2022 Guidance creates the reference path to achieve the\n\ndesired goal in nominal conditions.\n\u2022 Control produces forces required to follow the reference\n\npath.\nExpanding the GNC block of Fig. 12.1, a schematic\n\ndiagram of a closed-loop control system is depicted in\nFig. 12.19. The plant includes the actuators, the real world\ndynamics, and the sensors.\n\nThe GNC system must provide information to the top-\nlevel failure detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR)\nfunction and to the mission and vehicle management\n(MVM) function. The FDIR detects system and equipment\nfailures and recovers from them. The modern paradigm\nrequires FDIR functions at all levels. Thus, failure detection\nalgorithms are included in the GNC functions. The MVM\nmanages all the subsystems of the spacecraft, e.g. thermal,\npower. It defines the GNC modes and the sequencing of\nmaneuvers. The measurement management function takes\n\nFig. 12.18 Astrium Eurostar 3000 Meosat-3b\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 351\n\n\n\nthe raw observations from the sensors and produces vali-\ndated measurements in the proper format for the navigation\nfilter. Of particular relevance is the processing of raw\nimages from an optical camera or an imaging LIDAR. This\ntask is usually computationally expensive and is performed\nin a dedicated processor. The actuator management function\ntakes the control output and issues the commands to the\nactuators. As these functions are not specific to the GNC\nthey will not be detailed in this section.\n\nThe on-board GNC system must not be confused with\nthe Flight Dynamics System that is part of the ground\ncontrol system and will be discussed in Sect. 20.1.4, even\nthough the objectives of both systems are quite similar. The\nGNC has tight constraints on time response (reactivity or\nresponsiveness) and computational load. Thus, the perfor-\nmance of the on-board navigation and guidance functions\ncan be worse than the ground-based analogs.\n\nThe GNC system must allow monitoring by the ground\noperators. In addition, the on-board system must permit\nupdating of the GNC parameters using the ground infor-\nmation, including reset of the navigation function or change\nof the reference path.\n\nThe requirements of the GNC system depend on the level\nof autonomy of the spacecraft. If the position and motion are\nfully controlled from the ground, then the complete GNC\nsystem is not required. On-board autonomy aims to provide\nthe space segment with the capability to continue mission\noperations and to survive critical situations without relying\non ground segment intervention [6]. The on-board autonomy\ndepends on the specific mission requirements and constraints.\nThe autonomy level can vary between a very low level,\ninvolving a high level of control from ground, to a high level,\nwhereby most of the functions are performed on-board.\n\nThe autonomy of the space segment has an impact on\ntotal life cycle cost. Increased autonomy can increase the\ndevelopment costs, but decreases the operating costs.\nTherefore, the adoption of specific autonomy goals for a\ngiven mission is decided by careful balancing of costs,\nrisks, and schedules for both the development and the\noperation & maintenance phases. The need for autonomy is\nvery different from one mission to another, and there are\nthree factors that have a strong influence on the degree of\nautonomy that is required\n\n\u2022 Communication delays, when the characteristic time of\nthe mission is much shorter than ground control response\ntime (including communication signal round-trip time).\n\n\u2022 Environment uncertainty, where the safety of the mission\ndemands high reactivity to unknown disturbances, for\ninstance in missions to near-Earth objects (NEO).\n\n\u2022 Costs and operation teams downsizing, which is very\nimportant during long routine phases.\nIn summary, autonomous GNC systems are complex and\n\ncritical for space missions (in terms of cost, risk, and\nschedule). Therefore, nowadays autonomous GNC systems\nare implemented when they are the only feasible option, or\nin technology demonstration missions. Some examples\nwhere mission feasibility depends on autonomous GNC are\nrobotic rendezvous in orbit around Mars (e.g. Mars Sample\nReturn), pinpoint entry, descent and landing (EDL) for a\nsolar system body, or a hypervelocity impact or flyby of a\nsmall body (e.g. Deep Impact). There have been advance-\nments to reduce the operational costs of aerobraking at Mars\nby means of increased level of GNC autonomy (e.g. Mars\nReconnaissance Orbiter [7]) which takes several months\nand has many uncertainties and risks.\n\nSome examples of technology demonstration missions\nimplementing autonomous GNC are Deep Space-1, in\nwhich the autonomous flight of long interplanetary low\nthrust arcs reduced operational costs, or Prisma [38] for\nrendezvous and formation flying.\n\n12.6.1 Drivers for GNC Design\n\nAs follows from previous paragraphs, the capabilities and\nelements of the GNC system have to be designed on a case-\nby-case basis. Each mission has different objectives and\nconstraints that will drive the GNC requirements. The\nrequirements on the GNC system are derived from mission,\nsystem, or operational constraints. For instance, the GNC\nsystem required for Mars landing changes dramatically\ndepending upon whether the landing dispersion is several\nhundred kilometers or a few kilometers.\n\nTypical mission constraints are\n\u2022 Phase goal, such as the final position dispersion in a\n\nrendezvous (between chaser and target), in a landing\n\nGuidance ?+\n-\n\nControl \n\nPlant \n\nNavigation Filter \n\nx u Fig. 12.19 Schematic closed-\nloop control system\n\n352 B.

APE) or pointing stability (a.k.a. RPE).\nTypical operational constraints are\n\n\u2022 Communication windows with the ground control center\nduring certain critical operations.\n\n\u2022 Frequency of the ground updates, including the uncer-\ntainty and time delays of the upload parameters.\n\n\u2022 Visibility constraints of the sensors during the reference\ntrajectory, for instance operational range and illumination\nconditions.\n\n\u2022 Sequencing of operations, for instance the acquisition\ntime for sensors, the duration of slew maneuvers, and\ndata transmission to ground.\nFrom these top-level requirements, the engineering pro-\n\ncess will define the GNC architecture and will derive\nrequirements for each component of the GNC system. Then,\nanalysis and assessment of different options for each com-\nponent will permit the selection of the optimal algorithms\nand equipment to fulfill all the requirements.\n\nAccording to the validation and verification (V&V) plan,\ndifferent tests will be performed following the selected soft-\nware life cycle (e.g. V-cycle, spiral); see Chap. 16. A typical\nsequence is unit, integration, system, and acceptance tests.\nThe V&V of most of the requirements will require executing\nsimulations (e.g. Monte Carlo, worst-case). During the\n\nincremental stages in the development of a GNC system from\nlow TRL to flight, the fidelity of the simulation environment\nincreases accordingly. In order to accelerate the technology\ndevelopment process, there is a current trend to embed\nmodel-based development languages into real-time systems.\nThe technology development plan would consist of a series of\nsystems of progressively increasing TRL: model-in-the-loop\n(MIL), software-in-the-loop (SIL), processor-in-the-loop\n(PIL), and finally hardware-in-the-loop (HIL).\n\n12.6.2 Orbit Navigation\n\nThe navigation function is typically implemented as a\ndigital filter in the on-board computer. This must provide\nthe necessary parameters to the guidance and control\nfunctions, for example current vehicle state. If just one\nsensor is able to provide all of the required information by\nthe guidance and control functions, then the navigation\nalgorithm might be a simple low-pass filter, for example a\nLIDAR system providing range, line of sight (LOS) and\nrelative attitude during the last phases of rendezvous.\n\nAn example of a simple kinematic filter is the fading\nmemory filter. This is presented in Sect. 12.6.5 to filter the\nLOS provided by the camera and image processing during\nthe approach to a point-source object. The second-order\nfilter is formulated as follows (see [8] for the formulation of\ndifferent orders)\n\nqj\u00fe1 \u00bc yj\u00fe1 ? y?j \u00fe \u00f0tj\u00fe1 ? tj\u00de _?yj\nh i\n\ny?j\u00fe1 \u00bc y?j \u00fe \u00f0tj\u00fe1 ? tj\u00de _?yj \u00fe 1? \u00f01?\nffiffiffiffi\nG\np\n\u00de2\n\n? ?\nqj\u00fe1\n\n_?yj\u00fe1 \u00bc _?yj \u00fe G=\u00f0tj\u00fe1 ? tj\u00de\n? ?\n\nqj\u00fe1\n\u00f012:148\u00de\n\nwhere y?j is the filter output (predicted value) at time tj, yj is\nthe input (measured value), and qj\u00fe1 is the a priori residual\nat time tj+1. The second-order fading memory filter assumes\na linear trend in the measurement (see the a priori residual\nformula). This filter requires only one configuration\nparameter, the gain G, which is a constant between zero and\nunity and is related to the memory length of the filter.\nDecreasing G makes the filter remember more previous\nmeasurements at the expense of decreasing the reactivity of\nthe filter (i.e. decreasing the bandwidth).\n\nIn most situations, simple digital signal processing filters\nare not suitable because the navigation filter must estimate\nuncertain parameters not directly observed by the sensors\n(e.g. thrust level delivered by the propulsion system), and/or\nprocess measurements from different sensors (data fusion),\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 353\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_16\n\n\nat different frequencies, and/or estimate the vehicle state\nduring intervals without measurements (sensor black-out).\n\nTo achieve these navigation objectives, an optimal esti-\nmator is needed (e.g. a Kalman filter). A good example of\nthe design of a navigation filter is presented in [12] for\nmaking a precise landing on Mars. The sensor suite includes\na strapdown IMU, a phased-array radar and a scanning\nLIDAR. The radar and LIDAR provide altitude and surface-\nrelative velocity data, with the radar being the primary\nsensor. The proposed state vector contains 18 parameters\nfor estimated inertial position, velocity, attitude, and addi-\ntional parameters that are related to sensor modeling (gyro\nbias, accelerometer bias, surface slope and altimeter bias).\n\nThe optimal state estimation filters can be classified as\nsequential or batch filters. Sequential filters process only the\nlatest measurement while batch filters process a set of\nmeasurements taken during a certain time interval.\nSequential filters respond more rapidly to unexpected\nvariations in the state (e.g. detection of failures) but batch\nfilters are more robust to modeling errors. Examples of\nbatch filters are the weighted least-squares filter [9,\npp 14\u201317, 10] and the Square-Root Information Filter\n(SRIF) [9]. The same notation given in Sect. 12.1.4 for the\nextended Kalman filter is followed in the next equations.\nThe weighted least-squares filter aims at minimizing the\nweighted measurements residuals\n\nJ \u00bc \u00f0yj ?Hjx?j\u00deT W\u00f0yj ?Hjx?j\u00de \u00f012:149\u00de\n\nwhere y is the vector of measurements, H is the measure-\nment sensitivity matrix, W is the weight matrix, and x? is the\nestimate of the state. Minimizing the cost function J gives\nthe optimal estimate of the uncertain parameters. The\ncovariance of the estimation as follows\n\nx?j \u00bc \u00f0HTj WHj\u00de\n?1HTj Wyj\n\nPj \u00bc \u00f0HTj WHj\u00de\n?1HTj WRjWHj\u00f0HTj WHj\u00de\n\n?1 \u00f012:150\u00de\n\nwhere Rj is the covariance matrix of the measurement noise.\nThe SRIF is derived from the least-squares filter. This\n\nformulation achieves higher numerical stability and preci-\nsion at lower computational cost. These benefits become\nimportant when processing large batches of measurements.\nThe batch filters can be used in sequential mode if the batch\nonly includes the newest measurement. A priori information\ncan be included as an additional measurement.\n\nThe most popular filter for on-board navigation is the\nKalman filter [11], introduced in Sect. 12.1. It is a dynamic\nfilter that is usually used in sequential estimation, although\nbatch filtering is possible. There are several formulations\n\u2022 The linear Kalman filter (LKF) or just Kalman filter that\n\nconsiders a linear time-invariant dynamical model (ana-\nlytical transition matrix).\n\n\u2022 The extended Kalman filter (EKF) that considers non-\nlinear propagation of the average state.\n\n\u2022 The extended Kalman but with U-D decomposition1 of\nthe covariance matrix to assure the conservation of the\npositive definiteness in the time and measurement\nupdates.\n\n\u2022 The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) in which the statistics\nare propagated and constructed from a set of wisely\nselected points (sigma points).\nThe formulation of the EKF and UKF were described in\n\nSect. 12.1.4. The steps of the Kalman filter are schemati-\ncally shown in Fig. 12.20. The time update propagates the\naverage state and its covariance matrix from the last epoch\n(which may be the initialization epoch and state) to the\ncurrent measurement time (a priori state and covariance).\nThen, a test of hypotheses is done on the input measure-\nments. If the measurements are accepted, the measurement\nupdate provides the a posteriori state and covariance. The\nmeasurement update might be iterated in order to smooth\nthe non-linearities. The a posteriori residuals and covariance\nare checked against the hypotheses and the convergence\ncriterion. The output is prepared in the proper format and\nsome information is made available for aiding the mea-\nsurement management (e.g. for image processing).\n\nDifferent filters might be used in different phases of a\nmission. More usually, different configurations of a filter are\nrequired in different phases. The filter design must take into\naccount the un-modeled physical effects and their impact in\nthe propagation and observations, the uncertainty in the\nparameters of the considered dynamics and measurement\nmodels, the inclusion of multiple sensors in the navigation\nchain, and the allocated computer resources.\n\nThe augmented state vector refers to the uncertain\nparameters considered in the filter. The selection of its\ncomponents must consider the above mentioned issues. It\ntypically includes the spacecraft\u2019s state (in proper coordi-\nnates), and the uncertain parameters from the dynamics and\nmeasurements model.\n\nThe dynamics equation for each uncertain parameter\ndepends on the parameter itself and the application. The\nmost usual models for uncertain parameters from dynamics\nand measurements are biases (constant average value), drift\n(linear time dependency) or colored noises (e.g. exponen-\ntially correlated random variables [9]). Additive white\n\n1 The U-D decomposition avoids a problem of numerical stability\n(round-off error) in Kalman filters when the process noise covariance\nis small that can lead to a small positive eigenvalue being wrongly\ncomputed as a negative, causing the state covariance matrix to be\nindefinite when it should be positive-definite. The U-D decomposition,\nP \u00bc U ? D ? UT, where U is a unit triangular matrix (with unit\ndiagonal), and D is a diagonal matrix, avoids some of the square root\noperations required by alternative methods, while maintaining their\ndesirable properties.\n\n354 B. Wie et al.\n\n\n\nGaussian noise is usually included as process and mea-\nsurement noise. These noises come from unknown or un-\nmodeled sources. The process noise increases the a priori\ncovariance during the time update. The measurement noise\nreduces the weight of the measurements in the measure-\nments update. A high value of the variances of the noises, as\nprovided to the filter, to avoid divergence of is sometimes\ncalled artificial noise (which might include process noise in\nthe position differential equation).\n\n12.6.2.1 Measurement Types\nThe measurements are the other fundamental element of the\nnavigation function. The observation type and quality\ndepends on the sensor and on the processing algorithm of its\nraw data. The performance of a navigation filter is strongly\ndependent on the type of measurements, their frequency,\nand their quality. The performance of other systems (e.g.\npointing error and stability) affects the performance of the\non-board sensors.\n\nOften a single sensor cannot provide all of the required\nobservables during all the operational ranges of a mission,\nso a sensor suite is mounted. In each phase, different sensors\nare used, or the same sensor with different processing\nalgorithms (e.g. camera providing LOS at far distances, or\nproviding LOS and range at close distances). The filter\nprocesses different measurement types to estimate the\nuncertain parameters (data or sensor fusion). An example is\nthe hybridization of inertial navigation by an IMU with\nother sensor such as GPS or an altimeter. For the selection\nof the sensor suite, different issues must be taken into\nconsideration. For instance, for far-range operations the\nnominal sensor might combine a large FOV with a coarse\naccuracy in order to assure observation in the presence of\nlarge position errors. However, for close operations, the\nnominal sensor is switched to another one with a narrower\nFOV and a higher accuracy in order to achieve better\nnavigation performance. The following considerations must\nbe traded in order to optimize the sensor set.\n\u2022 What observables are needed for navigation.\n\u2022 Which sensors provide the observables (note that some\n\nsensors can provide several observables simultaneously).\n\u2022 What accuracy is required (accuracy should be one order\n\nof magnitude better than the overall GNC requirement,\n\nbut if this is not feasible, then at least two or three times\nbetter).\n\n\u2022 What is the operational range (distance, FOV, velocity,\nangular rate \u2026).\n\n\u2022 What are the system-level implications.\n\u2013 System constraints such as power, size, mass, cost.\n\u2013 Operational constraints such as illumination, on-board\n\nversus ground-based processing.\nThere are several sensors that might provide the same\n\nobservable in a given mission phase. The combination of\nthe different observables must provide the information\nrequired by the navigation filter (the system must be\nobservable). Note that not all of the estimated parameters\nneed to be directly observed. For instance, the velocity can\nbe estimated by a dynamic filter after a certain time using\nonly position-related observables (LOS and range). A list of\ndifferent sensors that can provide the most common\nobservables is given below. As technology evolves, new\nsensors appear that are more accurate, for instance the flash\nLIDAR or 3D time-of-flight (TOF), camera. Thus, the list\nbelow is not exhaustive but includes the most frequently\nused sensors for autonomous GNC applications. More\ndetails of specific sensors for rendezvous and formation\nflying will be given in Sect. 12.6.5.\n\u2022 Range (distance) measurements are directly provided by\n\naltimeters (e.g. radar type in ESA\u2019s Huygens), range-\nfinders (e.g. laser type in NASA\u2019s NEAR-Shoemaker), or\nRF sensors (e.g. in CNES\u2019s Formation Flying Radio\nFrequency system on the PRISMA mission). These are\nactive sensors because they emit energy and record the\nreturned signal. A summary of characteristics of altime-\nters and range-finders is provided in Table 12.6. Range\ncan be derived from camera images (passive sensor) in\ncertain applications by means of proper image processing\n(e.g. in ESA\u2019s ATV).\n\n\u2022 Range-rate can be provided by RF sensors that measure\nthe Doppler shift (e.g. the Russian Kurs system on Soyuz\nand Progress spacecraft), or by Doppler radar (e.g. the\nViking landers).\n\n\u2022 Line-of-sight can be provided by optical cameras (as in\nthe approach phase of JAXA\u2019s Hayabusa mission), RF\nsensors (the Kurs system for rendezvous), or by imaging\nLIDAR sensors (like the scanning LIDAR in ATV that\n\nMeasurement \nManagement \n\nAiding \n\nTime Update \nMeasurement \n\nCheck \nMeasurement \n\nUpdate \n\nNavigation \nMonitor \n\nInitialization Measurement \nFDIR \n\nEstimated \nParameters \n\nMeasurement \nManagement \n\nFig. 12.20 Functional\narchitecture of a Kalman filter for\nautonomous navigation\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 355\n\n\n\nprovides simultaneously range and LOS). 3D ranging\nsensors based on either triangulation or time-of-flight\n(LIDAR) can provide relative position and orientation\nduring close rendezvous or formation flying.\n\n\u2022 Horizontal velocity (normal to the LOS) can be measured\nby a Doppler radar (as in NASA\u2019s Mars Science Labo-\nratory) or by processing series of camera images (like\nDIMES in NASA\u2019s MER).\n\n\u2022 Complete position information is provided by sensors\nsuch as space-qualified GPS (or GNSS) receivers that\nprovide a PVT solution for a spacecraft in the vicinity of\nthe Earth (as in JAXA\u2019s HTV), an Inertial Navigation\nSystem (INS) based on IMU measurements (as in the\nAriane 5 or Vega launchers), or a 3D imaging sensor (like\nscanning LIDAR). The performance of some scanning\nLIDARs for the rendezvous application is presented in\nTable 12.7. INS provides position and velocity by inte-\ngration of the equation of dynamics using the combina-\ntion of gyro and accelerometer measurements of an IMU.\nVectorial acceleration in the instrument frame determined\nby the accelerometers needs the attitude reference pro-\nvided by the gyros to calculate the acceleration in the\ninertial frame. The performance of the INS navigation\nsolution depends on the accuracy of the initial conditions,\nthe gravitational model, and the non-gravitational accel-\neration measurements provided by the accelerometers.\nThe accuracy of the INS solution degrades with time, and\nsometimes hybridization with other sensors is needed.\nFor instance vision-based measurements or altimeters are\nenvisaged for pinpoint landing on the Moon (several\n\nhundred meters of landing dispersion). Hybridization of\nan IMU with other sensor might allow the use of lower\nIMU class (cheaper) and/or extend the duration without\nnavigation performance degradation (multiple ignitions\nduring launch).\nVision-based navigation is often used in many autono-\n\nmous GNC systems. The main reasons are the low cost and\nsystem requirements (mass, size, power) of the cameras.\nSome examples of navigation cameras used for interplane-\ntary navigation are presented in Table 12.8. Image pro-\ncessing can provide accurate LOS and range measurements\n(i.e. the full state), and even relative attitude. When\nobserving point source objects, the accuracy of the LOS\nmeasurement is a fraction of the pixel angular size, i.e. the\nFOV/number of pixels. Figure 12.21 shows different\nobservables that can be obtained from images of the Moon\nas an exemplar of an extended object. These observation\ntypes were traded for the design of the backup optical\nnavigation system for crewed missions [19]. The main\ndrawback is the image processing algorithms required to\nderive the observables.

The computation of the reference trajectory and\nmaneuvers often requires complex optimization algorithms\nthat must fulfill all the operational constraints. In some\nother cases, the same guidance algorithms implemented on-\nboard are used on the ground to design the reference tra-\njectory and maneuvers. During the flight, perturbations such\nas maneuver execution errors, navigational uncertainties,\noperational delays and additional constraints, and distur-\nbance forces, produce deviations from the reference tra-\njectory that the guidance and control functions must cancel\nat the expense of additional propellant mass.\n\nThe main hypothesis is that the deviations from the\nreference trajectory are small and can be corrected with\nsmall variations in the reference thrust profile. This\nassumption permits the use of perturbation methods to\ncompensate deviations from the trajectory. The guidance\nmethods vary if the maneuvers are impulsive (approximated\nby an instantaneous change in velocity) or finite thrust (the\nduration of the thrusting arcs has a non-negligible impact in\nthe trajectory). In case of low-thrust maneuvers, it is\nimportant to note that changing the thrust level (throttleable\nor pulse-modulated thrusters) and/or the thrust duration is\nrequired to be fully controllable. In addition, during long\nthrusting arcs it might be necessary to allocate short ballistic\narcs for navigation tasks.\n\nIf the maneuvers are applied in open-loop (no control\nfunction), the guidance dynamical model must be sufficiently\naccurate to achieve the desired goal. If the maneuvers are\nexecuted in closed-loop, the control function can compensate\nsmall unmodeled effects in the guidance function.\n\nAnalytical algorithms that provide the solution in closed-\nform are preferred for on-board implementation. These\nsolutions are not always available to achieve the guidance\nobjective within the allocated error budget. It is important to\nnote that the reference trajectory generated by the guidance\nalgorithm must fulfill the operational constraints. Thus, in\nmany cases the guidance problem is formulated as a con-\nstrained optimization problem.\n\nOne of the most useful guidance methods for impulsive\nmaneuvers is based on the differential guidance. It was\noriginally introduced for interplanetary navigation [18] but\ncan be applied to rendezvous, formation flying, orbit\nmaintenance, or descent and landing on small bodies. The\nbasic formulation is\n\ndrN\ndvN\n\n\t \n\n?\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\t \n\n\u00bc UN;0\n\ndr0\ndv0 \u00fe DV1\n\n\t \n\n\u00fe\n\n0\n\nDV2\n\n\t \n\n\nUN;0 ?\noxN\nox0\n\n:\n\n\u00f012:151\u00de\n\nIt considers an initial deviation from the reference tra-\njectory \u00f0dr0; dv0\u00de and two impulses, the initial delta-V\n(DV1) which cancels the final position deviation at a fixed\nfinal time drN, and the final delta-V (DV2) which cancels the\nfinal velocity deviation dvN.\n\nThe linear system of equations defined by Eq. 12.150 can\nbe solved explicitly. The key issue is the computation of the\ntransition matrix UN;0. For linear time-invariant systems the\ntransition matrix can be obtained analytically. In more\ncomplex dynamics, the transition matrix can be computed by\n\nTable 12.7 Performance of 3D imaging sensors for rendezvous\n\nScanning LIDAR\nPerformance\n\nMDA/Optech Spaceborne Scanning LIDAR System\n(SSLS)\n\nJena Optronik RVS (Rendezvous and Docking\nSensor)\n\nFOV 20? 9 20? 40? 9 40?\n\nMeasurement Range 2 m to 3 km 1 m to 2 km\n\nRange Accuracy 0.05 m (3r) @ short range Noise: 0.1 m (3r) @ long range\n\nBias: 0.5 m @ long range\n\nNoise: 0.01 m (3r) @ short range\n\nBias: 0.01 m @ short range\n\nLOS Accuracy 0.2?

Note that the second DV might never be\napplied since at the time of arrival at the final point a new\nmaneuver can be calculated to achieve the next guidance\nobjective (similar to a receding horizon control). The for-\nmulation can be extended to consider undefined final time. In\nthis case, the final time is solved by minimizing the total DV.\n\nThe differential guidance can be applied at intermediate\npoints of the trajectory to cancel perturbations that might\notherwise grow to an unacceptable level at the final time\n(Fig. 12.22). These trajectory corrective maneuvers (TCM)\ncan be applied at any instant if the navigation filter has\nconverged after the previous maneuver.\n\nWhen the effect of finite thrust on the trajectory is not\nnegligible, impulsive guidance cannot be applied. If the\nthrusting duration is not too long compared with the guid-\nance horizon, then a simple parameterization of the\nmaneuver can be used. The small number of parameters\npermits the optimization of the maneuvers with low com-\nputational cost. An extreme case was implemented in Deep\nSpace-1 [1]. This mission used electric propulsion to set up\nflybys of small bodies. Long low-thrust arcs were executed.\nThe thrust profile in spherical coordinates was discretized as\npiece-wise linear expansion. A parameter optimization\n\nproblem was solved analytically. The gain matrix depended\nonly on the sensitivity matrix of the final state deviation to\nthe maneuver parameters.\n\nWhen the thrust arcs are comparable to the guidance\nhorizon (e.g. electric propulsion) more refined parameter-\nizations are needed (for instance the guidance method in\n[21] was also applied to the descent and landing on small\nbodies). In some problems the optimal control theory [22,\nChap. 5] can be applied. The parameters of the optimal\ncontrol (initial co-states value) are solved to get the thrust\nprofile that fulfills the guidance objective. This option can\nsignificantly increase the guidance computation time\nbecause the co-states (aka adjoints) are propagated simul-\ntaneously. There are exceptions when the adjoint dynamics\ncan be solved analytically (e.g. optimal lunar descent and\nlanding).\n\nIn some landing missions, hazard avoidance is required.\nThe hazard avoidance system is usually not considered part\nof the GNC system. The measurements from the same\nsensors can be used by both, but the guidance will take as its\nobjective the site selected by the hazard avoidance system.\nIn turn, the hazard avoidance must consider the current\nnavigation-estimated state and the guidance capabilities to\ncompute the reachable site locus.\n\nTable 12.8 Characteristics of narrow angle cameras used for navigation\n\nMiniature integrated\ncamera and spectrometer\n(MICAS)\n\nNavCam Impactor\ntargeting\nsensor (ITS)\n\nNavigation\ncamera (NC)\n\nFraming\ncamera (FC)\n\nOptical navigation\ncamera-telescopic\n(ONC-T)\n\nHeritage Deep space 1 Rosetta Deep impact Stardust Dawn Hayabusa\n\nFOV (deg) 0.69 9 0.78 5 9 5 0.587 9 0.587 3.5 9 3.5 5.5 9 5.5 5.83 9 5.69\n\nDetector array\nsize (number of\npixels)\n\n1,024 9 1,024 1,024 9 1,024 1,024 9 1,024 1,024 9 1,024 1,024 9 1,024 1,024 9 1,000\n\nPixel size (lm) 9 13 21 12 14 12\n\nAperture (mm) 100 70 120 57.14 20 15\n\nFocal length\n(mm)\n\n677 152.5 2,100 202 150 120.8\n\nFig. 12.21 Illustration of star\nand limb related observables and\nimage matching (positioning)\nfrom Moon.

Wie et al.\n\n\n\n12.6.4 Orbit Control\n\nBased on the current vehicle state estimation from the\nnavigation filter and the reference trajectory computed at\nlower frequency by the guidance function, the main tasks of\nthe translation control function are to cancel deviations that\nare not compensated by the guidance in closed-loop (con-\ntroller proper), and to control the execution of the maneu-\nvers that are computed by the guidance and the controller.\n\nA closed-loop control system is presented in Fig. 12.19\n(feed-forward and direct link are not depicted). Every\ncomponent of the system introduces disturbances but these\nare not always additive (e.g. scale factors, cross-couplings).\nThe closed-loop system must be stable in the presence of\nsuch disturbances. The disturbances from the sensors and\nactuators might be specified in the GNC design. In some\ncases these components are fixed and the GNC system must\ncope with their performances.\n\nThe output of the guidance function is a DV (impulsive\nmaneuvers) or a thrust profile (finite thrust maneuvers). The\ncontrol function must translate these maneuvers into\nthe format required by the actuator management function.\nThe most common actuators for translation motion control\nare thrusters. Other actuators can be solar panels or solar\nsails that modify the solar radiation acceleration vector, or\naerodynamic control surfaces used in aero-assisted maneu-\nvers (e.g. entry, descent and landing).\n\nFor typical thruster management algorithms, the trans-\nlation control function must provide forces in spacecraft\nbody axes. The desired force can be achieved by controlling\neither the thrust level during a given duty cycle (throttling),\nor the thrusting time with a constant thrust magnitude\n\n(pulse-width in pulsed mode or total thrusting duration in\nsteady mode). The thruster management function will select\nthe optimal thrusters to provide the force, and also the\ntorque requested by the attitude control function. The\nthruster management function will also define the thrusting\ntime or thrust level of each thruster. Attitude constraints are\nconsidered in the guidance and controller algorithms. In\npractice, different thrusters might be used in different mis-\nsion phases, for instance thrusters providing hundreds of\nnewtons for large transfer maneuvers and newton-level\nthrusters for proximity operations.\n\nThe control function monitors the imparted acceleration\nin order to fulfill the guidance and controller commands.\nThe control of the maneuver execution can be done in\nclosed-loop or in open-loop. In open-loop the firing duration\nis computed from the expected acceleration. In closed-loop,\nstate updates at high frequency are usually needed. The\napplied DV during one thruster control cycle can be mea-\nsured by accelerometers if there are sensitive enough. If the\nacceleration provided by the thrusters is smaller than the\nresolution of the accelerometers, then other indirect mea-\nsurements might be used. For instance, in NASA\u2019s Deep\nSpace-1 the measurements of beam current and voltage\nwere used to estimate the low thrust provided by the ion\nengine [20]. Comparison with thrust measurements made\nbased on ground-based navigation showed a difference of\nless than 2 %.\n\nIn the case of a simple thruster architecture, the maneuver\nexecution control can consider thruster saturation (maximum\nthrust) and minimum impulse bit (MIB), i.e. minimum the\nthrusting time, in the computation of the commanded DV. For\nfinite thrust (usually low-thrust) a controller is usually\nimplemented. The maneuver execution control is less\ndemanding since the closed-loop controller frequently\nupdates the thrust profile and can compensate for execution\nerrors.\n\nIn some missions, the control function includes a closed-\nloop controller proper. This must cancel deviations pro-\nduced by maneuver execution errors, dynamical perturba-\ntions, and uncertainty in the state. Thus, a controller\nincreases the accuracy and robustness of the GNC at the\nexpense of increased complexity and usually higher pro-\npellant expenditure. The presence of a translation controller\nis required when there are tight final delivery requirements\n(e.g. terminal rendezvous or precise landing).\n\nThe basic objective of the closed-loop translation con-\ntroller of a space vehicle is to achieve the required perfor-\nmance and stability with low sampling rates. The\nperformance of the controller is expressed in terms of dif-\nferent metrics, often competing with each other, such as low\nsteady-state error and transient response error, sufficiently\nfast response time, and low propellant consumption. The\n\nFig. 12.22 Example of trajectory using differential guidance to\nachieve waypoints including intermediate corrective maneuvers.\nImage GMV\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 359\n\n\n\ncontroller is implemented in software in the on-board\ncomputer. Hence, a discrete control is required. Discreti-\nzation of continuous-time systems (e.g. bilinear or Tustin\ntransformation) is often valid, but better performance can be\nachieved by designing the GNC system directly in the\ndiscrete domain.\n\nDifferent trajectory control algorithms can be applied to\ndifferent mission phases. A common approach in controller\ndesign is linearization around the reference trajectory pro-\nvided by the guidance function. Some controllers often used\nfor translation motion control are regulators and terminal\ncontrollers [22].\n\nA regulator seeks to maintain a reference condition (e.g.\na fixed position or an orbit). A state feedback regulator\ncompares the reference state (guidance) with the estimated\nstate (navigation) and generates an acceleration to cancel\nthe error signal. Several methods exist to compute the\ncontrol gain and fulfill the performance and stability\nrequirements. The on-board implementation only needs to\nselect the gain corresponding to the current mission phase\nand GNC mode.\n\nThe proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller\ndescribed in Sect. 12.2.5 is one of the most popular control\ntechniques for single-input single-output (SISO) systems.\nThe control acceleration is defined in Eq. 12.122. In the\norbit GNC application the error signal is related to position\n(it might be an angle though). The proportional term reacts\nto a current error and is related to the response time (how\nfast the controller compensates a certain error). The integral\nterm cancels the steady-state error of a pure proportional\ncontrol. The integral term wind-up often appears in GNC\nsystems (thruster saturation). The derivative term provides\nsome prediction of the dynamics. It can help to decrease the\nsettling time, to damp future oscillations and/or overshoots,\nand to increase stability (introduces a phase lead). If the\nderivative line is present, it is convenient that the navigation\nfilter estimates the derivative of the state by minimizing the\nhigh frequency noise of the derivation.\n\nThe tuning of the controller consists of setting the dif-\nferent gains to achieve the requirements. There are several\nmethods of tuning the PID controller (for instance the\nZiegler-Nichols method) but they usually require manual\ntrial and error. The controller often includes notch filters to\navoid the excitation of lightly damped flexible modes. In\naddition, lag-compensation techniques are included when\nthe delays introduced into the system overly reduce the\nstability margins.\n\nThe main advantage of PID control is that it does not\nrequire knowledge of the plant model (recall, the plant\nincludes the actuators, the real world dynamics, and the\nsensors). However, it is only applicable when the channels\ncan be decoupled. When cross-couplings prevent the use of\n\nSISO control, modern multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) methods are used. The optimal space-state\nmethods require knowledge of the plant model in order to\nminimize a cost function. One simple optimal control\ntechnique is the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR), which\nassumes a linear (time-invariant) dynamics and a quadratic\ncost function J to compute the feedback control gain K that\nminimizes J. The formulation for continuous control was\npresented in Sect. 12.1.5.\n\nThe weight matrices Q and R are the controller tuning\nparameters (the cross-coupling of control and state in the\ncost is usually not included). There are many software\npackages to obtain the optimal control gain K for a given\nlinearized dynamics (i.e. A, B). If there are different refer-\nence states, then a set of gains are pre-computed and stored\non-board.\n\nWhen there are uncertainties in the plant parameters,\nrobust control methods are more convenient. These methods\nare mathematically cumbersome and require some knowl-\nedge of the plant. On the other hand, they can provide\ngraceful degradation of performance in the presence of\nbounded uncertainties (if the deviation of the uncertain\nparameter from its nominal value is excessive then the\nsystem becomes unstable).\n\nThe non-linearities such as thruster saturation can\nintroduce problems for stability and require proper treat-\nment. In addition, dead-bands can be introduced to reduce\npropellant consumption. Finally, it is important to highlight\nthe coupling between the navigation and guidance algo-\nrithms on the one hand, and the sensor and actuator\nequipment on the other. For instance, the navigation filter\nestimates the parameters requested by the guidance and\ncontrol functions, removing the high-frequency noise from\nthe sensors. Then, the guidance or control functions include\nthe estimated biases (zero-frequency terms) in a feed-for-\nward action in order to improve the GNC performance in\nterms of accuracy and propellant consumption.\n\nA terminal controller seeks to achieve the desired\nconditions at a terminal time. An example is finite-\nhorizon optimal control a problem of model predictive\ncontrol that has been proposed for a variety of applica-\ntions (pinpoint landing on Mars [22], low-thrust\ninterplanetary trajectory control [21], and precise landing\non asteroids [24].\n\nThe trajectory is divided into N segments, in each of\nwhich the gravity field is approximated by a linear expan-\nsion at selected nodes rK. Considering a zero-order hold\napproach for the control acceleration and neglecting the\nother forces acting on the vehicle (e.g. no atmospheric\ndrag), the resulting dynamics is a piecewise linear time-\ninvariant (LTI) system.

The cost function J is the sum of the squares\nof the control corrections duk, in order to minimize the\ndeviations from the optimal thrust profile (a quadratic\nobjective function is convenient in solving guidance and\ncontrol algorithms).

However,\nthey need to be iterated in order to fulfill the non-linear\nconstraints. Apart from the maximum thrust, attitude con-\nstraints are also non-linear and so must be considered\n[1, 21]. Nevertheless, the short computation time permits\non-board implementation at a frequency sufficiently high to\ntrack the reference trajectory. A receding horizon imple-\nmentation conveniently avoids singularities close to the\nterminal time.\n\n12.6.5 Applications of Autonomous GNC\n\n12.6.5.1 Rendezvous and Docking\nThe rendezvous phase consists of a series of operations that\nbring a chaser spacecraft from some thousands kilometers\n\nto station-keep with a target spacecraft as a preliminary to\nmating with it. The convention that will be used in this\nsection is that the origin of the relative coordinate system is\nlocated in the passive target and the chaser is the controlled\nspacecraft. The GNC system of the chaser is in charge of\ncontrolling the spacecraft state parameters in order to fulfill\nthe mission and system constraints and to achieve the\nrequired docking or capture requirements. From the point of\nview of the GNC, berthing can be seen as a particular case\nof docking when the final relative velocity and angular rates\nare zero.\n\nThe rendezvous operation has several subphases that\ninvolve different GNC modes and equipment configura-\ntions. An example of autonomous rendezvous would be for\na Mars sample return mission or an ATV approaching the\nISS. The boundaries of the subphases depend on the sensors\n\u2022 The initial phase is the launch and orbit injection. The\n\nchaser can be launched towards an orbiting target (e.g. an\nATV launched towards the ISS), or the target can be\nlaunched towards an already orbiting chaser (e.g. a Mars\nAscent Vehicle with the sample canister inside). The\nlaunch window must take into account the differential\nperturbations on the orbits of the target and chaser, the\navailable on-board delta-V capability, and the time\nrequired for spacecraft activation, including the initiali-\nzation of the relative navigation. The injection orbit must\nbe designed to be passively safe, to require a total DV for\nthe transfer to the target orbit that is within the available\nspacecraft budget, and to permit appropriate visibility\nwindows for relative navigation acquisition. For instance,\nsmall launch time errors can result in expensive orbit\nplane corrections but can be naturally corrected by the J2\ndifferential node drift.\n\n\u2022 The next phase is usually called phasing or synchroni-\nzation. The main objective is to bring the chaser to a state\nor entry gate suitable for initiating the last stages of the\nrendezvous phase. Most of the delta-V budget of the\nrendezvous is expended in this phase, because it repre-\nsents the largest changes in the orbit of the chaser. The\ndefinition of the synchronization strategy depends\nstrongly on the navigation performance during this phase,\non the timing to arrive at the entry gate, and on the\nmaneuver execution errors.\n\n\u2022 The far-range rendezvous or homing phase, or interme-\ndiate rendezvous, is where proper rendezvous operations\nstart. It is defined by continuous visibility of the target\nwith the far-range sensors, approximation of the relative\nmotion (e.g. by Hill\u2019s equations), and the small maneu-\nvers that are executed to approach to the target. This far\nrendezvous ends when short-range sensors can be\nacquired and there might be safety constraints on the\nlocation of the transition point (e.g. for the ISS the end of\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 361\n\n\n\nfar rendezvous must be outside a safety ellipsoid of\n2 9 1 9 1 km).\n\n\u2022 The close-range rendezvous might be divided into the\nclosing and terminal rendezvous subphases. The interface\nbetween these subphases is the safety corridor boundary.\nThe closing phase seeks to acquire the entry corridor\nconditions with dispersions that are much less than the\nsafety corridor dimensions. The safety constraints in this\nphase are as tight as they can be, and collision avoidance\nmaneuvers will be executed in off-nominal conditions.\nThe terminal rendezvous is the final phase, and usually\ninvolves a forced motion along a straight line with step-\nwise constant-approach rates. Continuous closed-loop\ncontrol of the trajectory and attitude assures the\nachievement of the required final conditions for mating.\nThe terminal rendezvous (sometimes known as the final\napproach) might end with a free drift to cover the last few\nmeters (due to thruster efflux contamination issues or\nsimply the availability of sensors).\nDuring the design of the rendezvous trajectory, some\n\n\u2018time-flexible elements\u2019 [5] must be included in order to\nsynchronize the rendezvous timeline with external events\n(visibility or communication windows) or schedules (crew\nor ground operations). The rendezvous timeline will need to\nbe modified in-flight due to the uncertainties and errors/\ndeviations that appear in real-world operations. Typical\ntime-flexible elements are hold points (i.e. constant relative\nposition) and free drift orbits.\n\nThe rendezvous problem has been traditionally analyzed\nin a circular orbit. However, elliptic rendezvous is nowa-\ndays often considered, if not for nominal operations (elliptic\norbits might yield better mission performance) at least for\ncontingency scenarios (e.g. orbit injection error). For the\nmost useful maneuvers in circular rendezvous [5], equiva-\nlent maneuvers in elliptic rendezvous have been defined\n[23], including time-flexible elements (with the hold points\nbeing periodic orbits around the hold point). In addition, the\nanalytical transition matrix of the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire\nequations (see Chap. 4) for circular orbits has an analogous\nclosed-form solution for the elliptic rendezvous [39].\n\nIn order to estimate the relative position of the chaser\nwith respect to the target, a sensor suite needs to be selected.\nDifferent sensors are available for relative navigation in\ndifferent scenarios. A trade-off for each particular mission is\nneeded. Table 12.9 summarizes the current sensors avail-\nable for rendezvous. Note that the orbit of the target or the\nchaser must be known in order to formulate the equations of\nthe relative motion. The reference orbit can be known from\nthe ground-based orbit determination system or from\nsatellite navigation systems like GPS (only in Earth orbit).\n\nThe relative state can be obtained from differences of\nabsolute measurements (if available from both vehicles and\nknown by the chaser GNC) but can lead to larger errors than\ndirect observations of the relative state.\n\nProviding specific values for sensor selection is difficult,\nbecause many parameters are mission dependent and must\nbe assessed specifically. For instance, the size of the target\nhas a significant effect on the operational range of some\nsensors (optical camera, RF and LIDAR on a target that\ndoes not have reflectors). However, some guidelines for\nsensor assessment can be provided for a rendezvous GNC\nsystem.\n\u2022 RF-sensors are good for medium to long distances\n\n(mainly homing and closing) including acquisition and\ncontingency (omni-directional or scanning antennas).\n\n\u2022 GPS is a reliable well-known technology but requires a\ncooperative target and is only available operationally in\nEarth orbit. Relative kinematic GPS (using phase) pro-\nvides sufficient performance (several cm with multipath)\nfor use in closing and terminal rendezvous.\n\n\u2022 Cameras with different fields of view can cover the entire\nrendezvous phase. The main problem for target acquisi-\ntion and orbit synchronization is the visibility constraints\n(illumination conditions, faint target). The visibility\nwindows for a narrow-angle camera and for an RF-sensor\n(omni-directional antennas on the target) are shown for a\nMars rendezvous scenario in Fig. 12.23.\n\n\u2022 Imaging LIDAR is a mature, robust, precise sensor that\ncan provide relative position and attitude measurements\nat relatively high frequency (*10 Hz). Its main draw-\nbacks are the limited operational range (only for close\nrendezvous) and the high cost, mass, and power con-\nsumption compared to other relative sensors.\nVision-based navigation is one of the most promising\n\ntechnologies for autonomous rendezvous, in particular\nwhen the target is non-cooperative one that does not\nincorporate aids for relative navigation. The cameras are\noften used in conjunction with other sensors in order to\nincrease the robustness (for instance omni-directional RF-\nsensors for a higher localization probability in the case of\nlarge uncertainties or LIDAR for the terminal phase). For\nredundancy, different optical heads and processing units are\nmounted. It is convenient that the MVM can configure any\ncombination of optical head and processing unit.\n\nDifferent cameras might be necessary to cover the entire\nrendezvous. For instance, for optical far-range, a camera\nwith narrow or moderate field of view (higher resolution) is\nbest. During the far imaging, the object appears as a point\nsource, and only the line of sight can be computed. The\nmaximum range depends on the sensitivity of the camera,\n\n362 B.

Long exposure times permit detection of fainter\nobjects. However, a short exposure time is preferable to\nrelax the attitude stability requirements. Some techniques\npermit these competing requirements to be traded off.\n\nIn optical close-range operations, the object is extended\nand a camera with larger field of view is preferred. In this\nphase, the shape of the object is distinguishable with suffi-\ncient resolution for the image processing function to\n\nprovide a distance to the target and even a relative attitude.\nDifferent image processing techniques are available to\nprovide the required observables.\n\nAs discussed in Chap. 4, Hill\u2019s equations, also called the\nClohessy\u2013Wiltshire equations of motion, are a system of\nlinear equations that approximate the relative motion\nbetween two bodies in orbit.

In addition, the analytical\ntransition matrices are well suited for the differential guid-\nance presented in Eq. 12.150. This discrete control can be\napplied in the case of impulsive transfers. Multiple rendez-\nvous strategies for the circular case are given in [5, Chap. 3].\nSome of them are extended for the elliptic rendezvous in\n[23]. For instance, in the case of V-bar hopping (Fig. 12.25),\nthe nominal maneuvers for each hop are given by\n\nDVZ1 \u00bc DVZ2 \u00bc\nx\n4\n\nDx \u00f012:158\u00de\n\nwhere Dx is the actual distance to be traversed. The duration\nof the hop maneuver is half an orbital period T. At an\nintermediate point, a correction maneuver can be applied\nusing the transition matrix presented in Eq. 12.156.\n\nIn the case of forced motion along the V-bar (Fig. 12.26),\nthe task of the guidance function is to compute the reference\nR-bar acceleration that will maintain a constant approach\nvelocity VX, considering the actual V-bar position from the\n\nnavigation. The approach velocity VX is usually defined\nfrom safety considerations. The continuous R-bar acceler-\nation cZ is given below. The duration Dt depends on the\napproach velocity and the traversed distance Dx. Continu-\nous control algorithms could be applicable in this continu-\nous-thrust maneuver, with the considerations for discrete\nimplementation mentioned in Sect. 12.6.4., namely\n\ncZ \u00bc 2xVX\n\nDt \u00bc Dx\nVX\n\n:\n\u00f012:159\u00de\n\n12.6.5.2 Terminal Phase of Missions to Small\nBodies\n\nWhen approaching an asteroid or comet, the spacecraft can\ntake observations of the target with on-board sensors. The\nattainment of these relative measurements marks the start of\nthe terminal phase of a mission to a small body. Thus, in\nthis phase the spacecraft state relative to the target can be\ndirectly estimated (though sometimes not the full state).\n\nThe terminal phase poses different requirements and\nconstraints for high-speed impact than for rendezvous\nmissions. A flyby of a small body presents many similarities\nwith an impact mission. For instance, NASA-JPL\u2019s Auto-\nNav system [26] was used in Deep Space-1 for the flyby of\ncomet Borrelly, in Stardust for the flyby of asteroid Anne-\nfrank, and in Deep Impact [40] for both the impactor and\nthe flyby spacecraft.\n\nAn important factor is the communication delay, typi-\ncally of tens of minutes, which is critical in hypervelocity\nimpact or in descent and landing. Thus, autonomous oper-\nation in certain critical phases is mandatory. Due to the\ndemanding delivery requirements, uncertain environment,\n\nFig. 12.25 Guidance and\ncontrol of V-bar hopping (or\nradial impulse transfer along V-\nbar)\n\nFig. 12.26 Forced motion approach along the V-bar straight line\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 365\n\n\n\nand tight operational constraints, the GNC system for the\nterminal phase is a critical enabling technology for missions\nto small bodies. For example, in an impact with a small\nbody that is several hundred meters in size, the delivery\naccuracy must be several tens of meters.\n\nAny mission to a small, irregular body has to cope with\nuncertain environmental conditions, namely the spacecraft\u2019s\ndynamical environment, and the shape, rotational state and\nsurface characteristics of the target. In addition, the forces\nacting on the spacecraft are all small. Thus, the uncertainties\nin the dynamical model have a significant effect on trajec-\ntory prediction and in critical phases such as descent and\nlanding.\n\nThe most generic methods to obtain relative observations\nare images with a camera (in the visual or near-infrared\nspectral range), and/or range measurements with a range-\nfinder (radar or laser). The range output can be a digital\nelevation map (DEM) using a 3D sensor such as an imaging\nLIDAR. Typically, camera measurements can be taken at a\ngreater distance than for a range-finder.\n\nAt the beginning of the terminal phase, the first objective\nof the GNC system is to detect and identify the small body\nagainst the starry background. Small, irregular objects\nobserved at long distances (*106 km) are point sources\nwith low visibility. Thus the object is very faint and its\nbrightness is highly variable. The observability depends on\nthe rotational state of the object and the Sun-target-space-\ncraft relative geometry (distances and angles).\n\nLong image integration times increase the signal-to-\nnoise ratio. A tight relative pointing error (RPE) is required\nin order to concentrate the photons around a single pixel.\nDuring long integration times without tight RPE, a point\nsource will produce a characteristic pattern in the image.\nFor this imaging strategy, Deep Space-1 implemented an\nimage processing technique called multiple cross-correla-\ntion [26]. Such image processing algorithms correlate each\nobject in an image with a mask template extracted from the\nsame image for center finding.\n\nFor target detection and point-source tracking, a narrow-\nangle camera \u00f0FOV. 5\t \u00de is the best option because it\nprovides higher sensitivity and line of sight accuracy. The\nline of sight accuracy is typically a fraction of the pixel\nangular size (or pixel FOV = FOV/No. pixels). A star\ntracker (FOV *10?) can be a good alternative in order to\nreduce the equipment carried if the reduction in accuracy\nand sensitivity is acceptable.\n\nEarly maneuvers are more effective for correcting devi-\nations, but navigation accuracy is usually worse at larger\ndistances. Hence, it is necessary to design in parallel the\nnavigation chain, the guidance strategy, and the control\nsystem to achieve the delivery requirements with optimal\nuse of the on-board resources.\n\nIn the case of an impact or flyby mission, the time-to-go\n(time to impact or to minimum distance) is not controlled.\nTherefore, only deflection maneuvers are required to control\nthe impact point. Several guidance and control strategies\ncan be applied [28], involving different propulsion systems.\n\u2022 Predictive-impulsive guidance, where impulsive maneu-\n\nvers are executed at predefined times. This strategy is\nsuitable for relatively high thrust (e.g. tens of newtons for\nvehicles of several hundred kilograms).\n\n\u2022 Proportional navigation, where continuous thrust is pro-\nportional to the line of sight rate and approach speed.\nThis is a well-known method for missile guidance. It is\nparticularly suitable for low-thrust propulsion (e.g. less\nthan 1 N for vehicles of several 100 kg). The minimum\nthrust required to compensate for the initial deviation of\nthe impact point must be considered.\n\n\u2022 A hybrid scheme that implements mid-course predictive\u2013\nimpulsive guidance and terminal proportional-navigation.\nIt is designed for missions with intermediate thrust levels.\nThe navigation filter is closely related to the impact\n\nguidance and control strategy. For the above mentioned\nstrategies, two types can be implemented\n\u2022 Estimation of the line of sight and its time derivatives.\n\nSome applicable filters are digital fading-memory or\nbatch-sequential least squares. These filters are more\nsensitive to the image processing performance.\n\n\u2022 Estimate the complete relative state vector with a\ndynamic filter (e.g. a Kalman-Schmidt filter [29] ). These\nfilters are prone to overestimate the innovation (or mea-\nsurement residual) vector and also suffer numerical\nproblems due to the non-observability of some compo-\nnents of the state vector.\nThe rendezvous missions present notable differences.\n\nDuring the approach phase most of the relative velocity is\ncanceled by means of braking maneuvers. The duration of\nthis phase is long enough to involve ground control in the\nnavigation chain. This relaxes the requirements in the image\nprocessing, although due to the communication limitations\nsome critical pre-processing operations might still be done\non-board. Thus, a fully autonomous GNC is not mandatory\n(different levels of autonomy might be used depending on\nthe particular mission).\n\nThis approach can be split in two phases, far and close\napproach. During the far approach, the celestial object is a\npoint source in the image. It starts after successful detection\nand identification of the small body. Asteroids of *1 km\nare typically resolved (extend over several pixels) at a range\nof *1,000 km. This marks the end of the far approach.\n\nLaser range-finders used in past missions to small bodies\nachieved target acquisition at 250 km (NEAR-Shoemaker)\nand 50 km (Hayabusa). Photometry can be used to infer\nrange from the brightness of the object. However, the\n\n366 B. Wie et al.\n\n\n\nmeasurements are subject to very large error (up to 100 %\ndepending on prior knowledge of the object\u2019s lightcurve\nand properties). Thus, during far approach, the navigation\nfunction must estimate the relative distance and speed\nwithout direct range measurements. The more accurate\noptions are\n\u2022 Long ballistic flight allowing long observation arcs\n\n(spanning a significant portion of the object\u2019s orbit). It\ntakes a long time, and the relative trajectories must pro-\nvide good observability conditions.\n\n\u2022 Execute \u2018dog-leg\u2019 maneuvers in order to rapidly change the\nobservation geometry [30]. Proper design of the approach\ntrajectory (and thus the maneuvers) is mandatory.\nIt is important to note that due to the irregular shape of\n\nmost small bodies there is a risk of losing tracking during the\nfar approach (Fig. 12.27). The image processing and navi-\ngation filter must be robust against such an event [30]. The\naccuracy of the navigation filter depends on prior knowledge\nof certain characteristics of the object. The sequence of\noperations must assure that there is sufficient knowledge of\nthe target to accomplish the next phase objectives.\n\nIn the close approach the target appears as an extended\nobject in the camera frame. In addition, if a range-finder is\nmounted, range measurements become available within a\ncertain distance. The image processing algorithm might be\nbased on center of brightness (CoB) computation. Other\nmore accurate and complex image processing techniques\nrequire knowledge if the size and shape of the object. The\ncenter of brightness\u2013center of mass (CoB\u2013CoM) offset\nshould be considered in the navigation filter. The GNC\nalgorithms can be applied in certain modes of the proximity\noperations.\n\nIn the proximity operations, the gravity of the target\nbecomes non-negligible, and will be the most significant\nforce during descent and landing. Still, the dynamics are\nslow and a fully autonomous GNC is not mandatory, except\nfor descent and landing. The weak, irregular gravity field\nopens new possibilities for orbiting the target, like hovering\n(station-keeping) or self-stabilized terminator orbits (a.k.a.\nphoto-gravitational orbits). The selection of the most\n\nappropriate sequence of orbits for a certain mission depends\nmainly on the uncertainties of the gravity field (safety\nissues), surface observability (for science and navigation),\nand propellant expenditure.\n\nWhen the target has a large angular size, a wide angle\ncamera \u00f0FOV J 20\t \u00de is the best option for vision-based\nnavigation. The image processing can use different tech-\nniques to obtain relative measurements. The Hayabusa\nmission demonstrated that the necessary image processing\ncan be done on the ground. If the image processing is done\nautonomously, then a dedicated processing unit might be\nneeded. If good knowledge of the size and shape of the\nasteroid is available, limb-related measurements (limb-star\nangular distance or star occultation time) or image matching\ncan be obtained.\n\nIf the images have sufficient resolution of the surface of\nthe target, then known landmark identification or unknown\nfeature tracking is feasible. Known landmark mapping\npermits direct positioning of the spacecraft state in the\ntarget\u2019s body-fixed frame. Unknown landmark tracking\nprovides measurements of the velocity relative to the sur-\nface. Thus, unknown landmark tracking must be used in\ncombination with other measurements for complete state\nestimation.\n\nAn interesting option to simplify the image processing is\nto deliver markers to the surface, which was the Hayabusa\nstrategy. The markers can either include LEDs or be illu-\nminated using a flash, to make them the brightest objects in\nthe image. The markers serve as beacons (artificial land-\nmarks) to land in a given position nearby.\n\nThe use of an altimeter for navigation is mandatory if\ninformation on the shape and size of the target is not\navailable from previous phases (from science observations\nor ground-based navigation). In any case, altimetry signif-\nicantly increases the robustness and accuracy of the navi-\ngation system. If a 3D sensor (e.g. imaging LIDAR) can be\nused, then the 3D images can be used for terrain-relative\nnavigation. Such 3D images provide more information than\ncombined optical images and altimetry, but need to be\ntraded with the total cost, mass, power and volume. Note\n\nFig. 12.27 Simulated images of\nan Eros-shaped asteroid at the\npoint of peak brightness\n(minimum integrated\nmagnitude); axis of rotation\nperpendicular to the approach\nplane. Image GMV\n\n12 Attitude and Orbit Control Systems 367\n\n\n\nthat redundancy in the navigation chain is needed for a\nsingle-failure tolerant system.\n\nThe objective of a descent and landing (D&L) might be\neither to land softly at a given point or to hover at a very\nlow altitude above a selected site. The GNC must be fully\nautonomous below the so-called low gate, in analogy the\nApollo with lunar missions. Some navigation sensors (e.g.\noptical cameras or imaging LIDAR) must avoid large\nangular rates and maintain the landing site continuously in\nview. Thus, for trajectory control the propulsion system\nshould be able to provide pure force (no torque) in any\ndirection, i.e. no rotation is required in order to apply force\nin any direction.\n\nThe orientation of the spacecraft with respect to the\nsurface of the target must assure that there is no risk of\ncollision of solar arrays or tumbling after touchdown. Thus,\na 3D sensor or a number of tilted altimeters should provide\ninformation of the orientation of the vehicle with respect to\nthe surface. The sensors must be assured of good visibility\nduring all phases. For instance, a star tracker must not be\nblinded or dazzled during the proximity operations, and the\nlegs must not appear in the wide-angle camera images.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Wertz, J. R.

Meseguer, Isabel Pe?rez-Grande, Angel Sanz-Andre?s\nand Gustavo Alonso\n\nOne of the problems that needs to be solved in order to\nachieve a successful space mission is to ensure suitable\nthermal behavior of all the spacecraft subsystems, which\nmay not seem critical or problematic in the case of Earth-\nbased equipment. However, it is crucial in the space envi-\nronment. The physical and technical basis for the thermal\ncontrol design of spacecraft is the main subject of this\nchapter.\n\nThis chapter is mainly devoted to the thermal control\nsubsystem, whose task is to maintain the temperature of all\nspacecraft components, subsystems, engineering equipment,\npayloads and the total flight system at safe operating and\nsurvival levels during the entire life of the spacecraft for all\nmission phases. Like any other subsystem, the spacecraft\nthermal control subsystem is essential to ensure reliable\noperation and long-term survival of any spacecraft.\n\nThe thermal control process generally involves the\ncontrolled exchange of heat between the different parts of\nthe vehicle, and between the vehicle and the environment\ndriven by thermal radiation. The latter can be seriously\naffected if the surface properties (solar absorptance a, and\nemissivity e) are modified by environmental conditions. In\ngeneral, the environmental effects related to vacuum, neu-\ntral environment, radiation and micrometeoroids/orbital-\ndebris, modify the absorptance/emissivity ratio of the\nspacecraft\u2019s external surfaces, whereas those related to\nplasma affect the re-attraction of contamination.\n\nIn the next section, the fundamentals of heat transfer for\nspacecraft thermal design are presented. A brief review of\nthe different technologies used for spacecraft thermal con-\ntrol is presented in Sect. 13.2. Finally, Sect. 13.3 is devoted\nto describing the main aspects of thermal control design,\nanalysis, and testing.\n\n13.1 Fundamentals of Heat Transfer\nfor Spacecraft Thermal Design\n\nIn this section, some basic concepts about heat conduction\nand thermal radiation heat transfer are presented. Owing to\nthe vacuum conditions in the space environment, convec-\ntion is not considered. The aim of this short review is to\nmake the reader familiar with the concepts and notation that\nwill be used in this chapter. For more detailed information\nabout heat transfer in general, a number of general text-\nbooks on heat transfer, such as [1\u20133] are available. For more\nspecific information about thermal radiation, the reader is\nreferred to [4, 5].\n\n13.1.1 Conductive Heat Transfer\n\nHeat conduction is the transfer of thermal energy between\nregions of matter in response to a temperature gradient. The\nphysical mechanism is related to the transfer of free elec-\ntrons from areas with higher energy (higher temperature) to\nareas with lower energy (lower temperature), and to lattice\nvibration. Thus, heat conduction requires the presence of\nmolecules (matter); it is not possible in a vacuum, and takes\nplace within solids and fluids (liquids and gases).\n\nThe equation that describes heat conduction is Fourier\u2019s\nlaw. It allows the calculation of heat fluxes for a given\ntemperature field. Temperatures are calculated from the\nprinciple of energy conservation.\n\n13.1.1.1 Fourier\u2019s Law\nFourier\u2019s law is an empirical law derived from experimental\nevidence and observation. Consider a wall of thickness\nDx and area A, as shown in Fig. 13.1. Let the temperature be\nuniform over the area A on both wall surfaces. Assume that\nthe temperature is higher on the left face of the wall and\nlower on the right one.\n\nJ. Meseguer ? I. P\u00e9rez-Grande ? A. Sanz-Andr\u00e9s ? G. Alonso (&)\nUniversidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid Madrid, Spain\ne-mail: gustavo.alonso@upm.es\n\nM. Macdonald and V. Badescu (eds.), The International Handbook\nof Space Technology, Springer Praxis Books, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_13,\n? Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014\n\n371\n\n\n\nFourier\u2019s law states that the rate of heat flux, _Q, through\na uniform material is directly proportional to the area of\nheat transfer and to the temperature gradient, DT, in the\ndirection of the heat flux, and is inversely proportional to\nthe length of the path flow, Dx. Thus\n\n_Q / A DT\nDx\n\n: \u00f013:1\u00de\n\nThe constant of proportionality is the so-called thermal\nconductivity. Hence\n\n_Q \u00bc kA DT\nDx\n\n: \u00f013:2\u00de\n\nThe thermal conductivity, k, is a physical property that is a\ncharacteristic of the materials, and its SI units are W/(m ? K).\nIt is a measure of how fast heat flows in the material.\n\nThe thermal conductivity of different materials varies\nconsiderably. Thus, there are up to four orders of magnitude\nof difference between the thermal conductivity of gases and\nthat of conductive metals. Table 13.1 shows a list of the\nthermal conductivity of several materials used in spacecraft\ndesign.\n\nEvaluating Eq. 13.2 in the limit Dx ? 0, the heat rate is\ngiven by\n\n_Q \u00bc ?kA dT\ndx\n: \u00f013:3\u00de\n\nNote that the negative sign in the previous equation\nindicates that the transfer of heat occurs from higher to\n\nlower temperatures. The heat flux density, q \u00bc \u00f0 _Q=A\u00de, or\nthe heat flux per unit of time and area is\n\nq \u00bc ?k dT\ndx\n: \u00f013:4\u00de\n\nFourier\u2019s law has been introduced under the restricted and\nsimplified conditions of one-dimensional, steady-state con-\nduction in a plane wall. In these conditions, the temperature\ndistribution can be shown to be linear. However, Fourier\u2019s\nlaw also applies to multi-dimensional and transient con-\nduction in complex geometries. In these cases the tempera-\nture field is not evident. Thus, a more general form of\nFourier\u2019s law for a three-dimensional case can be written as\n\nq \u00bc ?krT \u00bc ?k oT\nox\n\ni\u00fe oT\noy\n\nj\u00fe oT\noz\n\nk\n\n? ?\n: \u00f013:5\u00de\n\nNote that the heat flux, q, is a vector quantity and T(x, y,\nz) is the scalar temperature field. It is implicit in Eq. 13.5\nthat the heat flux vector, q, is perpendicular to the isother-\nmal surfaces.\n\nIn the one-dimensional case, mainly in the field of\nthermal modeling, it is sometimes useful to write Fourier\u2019s\nlaw in terms of thermal resistance, Rth, a magnitude that\ndepends not only on the material but also on the geometry.\nIt is defined as Rth = d/(k ? A), in this case d being the heat\npath length, and A the area of heat flux. Substituting this\n\ndefinition into Eq. 13.2 yields _Q \u00bc \u00f0DT=Rth\u00de. This means\nthat a heat flux _Q can be analyzed in a similar way to an\n\nelectric current. In Ohm\u2019s law, _Q would be the intensity, the\ntemperature difference DT would correspond to the elec-\ntrical voltage, and the thermal resistance, Rth, to the elec-\ntrical resistance.\n\n13.1.1.2 The Heat Diffusion Equation\nFourier\u2019s law described in the previous subsection allows\nthe calculation of heat fluxes for a given temperature field.\nHowever, one of the major objectives in a conduction\nanalysis is to determine the temperature field in a domain as\na result of the conditions imposed on its boundaries. Heat\nfluxes can then be calculated from this temperature field.\n\nTo do this, the energy balance equation applied to an\nelemental volume can be stated, in Cartesian coordinates as\n\no\n\nox\nk\noT\n\nox\n\n? ?\n\u00fe o\n\noy\nk\noT\n\noy\n\n? ?\n\u00fe o\n\noz\nk\noT\n\noz\n\n? ?\n\u00fe _qv \u00bc qcp\n\noT\n\not\n\n\u00f013:6\u00de\n\nwhere _qv is the rate at which energy is generated per unit\nvolume of the medium, q is the medium density, cp is the\nthermal capacity, and qcp\u00f0oT=ot\u00de is the time rate of change\nof the internal energy of the medium per unit volume. For\nthe one-dimensional case, if the thermal conductivity is\nconstant and _qv \u00bc 0, then Eq. 13.6 can be simplified and\nwritten in the form\n\no2T\n\nox2\n\u00bc 1\n\nad\n\noT\n\not\n\u00f013:7\u00de\n\nwhere ad \u00bc k=\u00f0qcp\u00de is the thermal diffusivity.\n\n13.1.1.3 Boundary and Initial Conditions\nTo determine the temperature field in a medium it is nec-\nessary to solve the heat diffusion equation. To do that, it is\nnecessary to know some physical conditions at the bound-\naries. These can be given as temperatures, heat fluxes, or a\ncombination of both.

Mathematically, the heat diffusion\nequation is a differential equation that requires integration\nconstants in order to have a unique solution. Boundary\nconditions are in fact the mathematical expressions or\nnumerical values necessary for this integration.\n\n13.1.1.4 Conductive Shape Factors\nIn two- or three-dimensional conduction problems where\nonly two temperature levels are involved, a conductive\nshape factor, Sc, can be defined in such a way that the heat\ntransfer rate may be expressed as\n\n_Q \u00bc SckDT : \u00f013:8\u00de\n\nThe conductive shape factor, Sc, has been obtained\nanalytically for numerous two and three dimensional sys-\ntems and the values for some simple configurations can be\nfound in [3, 7].\n\n13.1.1.5 Numerical Methods in Heat Conduction\nThe equations shown in the previous sections can be solved\nby analytical methods only in certain particular cases. These\nsolutions are available in the literature for different geom-\netries. When it is not possible to obtain an exact mathe-\nmatical solution, the best alternative is often to use a\nnumerical technique. Numerical solutions allow tempera-\nture determination only at discrete points of a system,\nunlike analytical solutions, which give the temperature field\nfor all points of the medium. The most widely used\nnumerical methods for heat conduction are the finite-dif-\nference, finite-element, and boundary-element methods. For\nthermal control purposes lumped capacitance models are\nused. To apply numerical methods, the system has to be\ndivided into regions where the temperature is assumed to be\nuniform, this temperature value being the average temper-\nature of the region. Generally, in order to assign properties,\nthe centers of these regions are used as reference points.\nThey are called nodes.

The accuracy of the calculations strongly\ndepend on the number of nodes, their sizes, and their\nlocations. The higher the number of nodes, the more\naccurate the results, but the procedure is more time con-\nsuming. Figure 13.2 shows a typical discretization of a\nsatellite surface.\n\n13.1.2 Thermal Radiation Heat Transfer\n\nThermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted from\nall matter that is at a non-zero absolute temperature, in the\nwavelength range from 0.1 to 100 lm: It includes part of\nthe ultraviolet (UV) range, and all the visible and infrared\n(IR) ranges. It is called thermal radiation because it is\ncaused by and affects the thermal state of matter. Fig-\nure 13.3 shows the electromagnetic spectrum with the\nregion of thermal radiation indicated on it. Note that this is a\nsimplified version of Fig. 3.3.\n\nTherefore, thermal radiation does not require a material\nmedium for its propagation. Although in the context of\nspacecraft thermal design the interest in radiation is mainly\nfocused on solid surfaces, emission may also occur from\n\nliquids and gases. The mechanism of radiation emission is\nrelated to the energy released as a result of oscillations or\ntransitions of the electrons that constitute matter. These\noscillations are sustained by the internal energy, and\ntherefore the temperature of the matter.\n\nAll forms of matter emit radiation since they are at non-\nzero absolute temperature. For gases and for semi-trans-\nparent media, thermal radiation is a volumetric phenome-\nnon. This can be of interest when studying the behavior of\nlenses, for instance, incorporated into optical devices.\n\nSince thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation, the\nproperties of the propagation of electromagnetic waves can\nbe applied. The most relevant ones are the frequency, m, and\nthe wavelength, k, which are related through k \u00bc c=m\u00f0 \u00de,\nwhere c is the speed of light in the medium.\n\nThe spectral nature of thermal radiation is one of the two\nfeatures that make its study quite complex. The second\nfeature is related to its directionality. A surface may have\ncertain directions with preferential emission; in this case,\nthe distribution of the emitted radiation is directional.

As can be seen, the surface emits Ue,\nreceives the incident radiation Ui, part of which, Ua is\nabsorbed, Ur is reflected, and Ut is transmitted.\n\nThe intensity of emitted radiation, Ie, is defined as the\nrate at which the radiant energy, dU, is emitted at the\nwavelength k in the direction (h, /), per unit area of the\nemitting surface normal to this direction, per unit solid\nangle dx about this direction, and per unit wavelength\ninterval dk about k, as indicated in Fig. 13.5.

Thus, the spectral hemispherical\nemissive power Ek is the rate at which radiation of wave-\nlength k is emitted in all directions from a surface per unit\nwavelength interval dk about k and per unit surface area.

Analogous definitions and\nmathematical expressions can be established for the inci-\ndent radiation on a surface, called irradiation, G, and for all\nthe radiation leaving a surface (the sum of the reflected\nradiation and the emitted radiation), called radiosity, J. Both\ncan be defined at a spectral and directional level, at a\nspectral hemispherical level, and as a total magnitude\nintegrated over all directions and all wavelengths.\n\n13.1.2.1 Black-Body Radiation\nA black-body is characterized by an ideal surface that\nabsorbs all incident radiation, at all wavelengths and all\ndirections. Therefore, it is the perfect absorber. As a con-\nsequence of this definition, the black-body has three prop-\nerties: (a) it is the surface that most emits for a given\ntemperature and wavelength, (b) black-body radiation does\nnot depend on the direction, that is, black-body radiation is\ndiffuse, and (c) total black-body radiation in a vacuum only\ndepends on its absolute temperature.\n\nSince the black-body is the perfect absorber and emitter,\nit will be used as a reference to compare the radiative\nproperties of real surfaces.\n\nThe spectral emissive power Ek,b of a black-body was\nobtained by Planck as\n\nEk;b k; T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\n2phc2\n\nk5 ehc= kkT\u00f0 \u00de ? 1\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00f013:12\u00de\n\nwhere h = 6.626 9 10-34 J ? s is the Planck constant,\nk = 1.380 9 10-23 J/K is the Boltzmann constant, and\nc = 2.998 9 108 m/s is the speed of light in vacuum. The\nsubscript b stands for black-body. This expression is the\nPlanck distribution. The graphical representation of con-\nstant temperature curves, Fig. 13.6, provides valuable\ninformation.\n\nFrom Fig. 13.6, it can be seen that for a given wave-\nlength the emitted radiation increases with temperature.\nEach constant temperature curve has a maximum.

Meseguer et al.\n\n\n\nmaximum moves towards longer wavelengths as the tem-\nperature decreases. If Eq. 13.12 is derived to obtain the\nwavelength where the maximum emissive power occurs, the\nresult is Wien\u2019s displacement law, given by kmaxT \u00bc C3,\nwhere C3 \u00bc 2; 898 lm ? K. Furthermore, the region where\nradiation is concentrated also moves towards longer wave-\nlengths as the temperature decreases. As discussed in Sect. 3.\n2.3, the Sun\u2019s radiation can be plotted as equivalent to a\nblack-body at approximately 5,781 K, and it is evident that\nthe visible part of the spectrum is included in it. For tem-\nperatures of about 300 K, similar to the Earth\u2019s surface,\nradiation is concentrated in the infrared part of the spectrum.\n\nThe spectral emissive power of a black-body is given in\nEq. 13.12, which can be integrated to obtain the total\nemissive power of a black-body giving\n\nEb T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nZ1\n\n0\n\nEk;b k; T\u00f0 \u00dedk \u00bc rT4 \u00f013:13\u00de\n\nwhere r = 5.67 9 10-8 W/(m2 ? K4) is the Stefan-Boltz-\nmann constant. This result, Eb \u00bc rT4, is known as the Ste-\nfan\u2013Boltzmann law, and can be used to obtain the radiation\nemitted by a black-body in all directions and all wavelengths.\n\nWhen it is necessary to know the fraction of energy\nemitted by a black-body at a temperature T within the\nbandwidth between k1 and k2, it can be calculated from\n\nFk1!k2 \u00bc\n1\n\nrT4\nZk2\n\nk1\n\nEk;b k; T\u00f0 \u00dedk: \u00f013:14\u00de\n\nThe quantity F0!k, that is, the fraction of energy emitted by\na black-body between 0 and the wavelength k depends only\non the product kT. It can be found tabulated in the refer-\nences of heat transfer and thermal radiation mentioned\npreviously.\n\n13.1.2.2 Properties of Real Surfaces\nThe black-body has been defined as an ideal surface to be\nused as a reference to describe the behavior of real surfaces.\nSince the black-body is the perfect emitter, any real surface\nwill emit less than the black-body at the same temperature,\nsame wavelength and same direction. Thus, the spectral\ndirectional emissivity is defined as the ratio between the real\nemission and the black-body emission for the same tem-\nperature, wavelength and direction\n\ne k; h;/; T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Ik;e k; h;/; T\u00f0 \u00de\nIk;b k; T\u00f0 \u00de\n\n: \u00f013:15\u00de\n\nSpectral hemispherical emissivity is defined as the ratio\n\ne k;T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Ek k; T\u00f0 \u00de\nEk;b k; T\u00f0 \u00de\n\n: \u00f013:16\u00de\n\nWhen the surface is diffuse, the spectral hemispherical\nemissivity has the same value as the spectral directional\nemissivity. When the properties of the surface depend on\nthe direction, the spectral hemispherical emissivity can be\nobtained by appropriately integrating Eq. 13.15 according\nto the definition given in Eq. 13.16 [2].\n\nThe second group of radiant properties is related to\nirradiation. As already said, a surface will be irradiated by\nthe radiation coming from other surfaces. This incident\nradiation will be partially reflected, partially absorbed and\npartially transmitted (see Fig. 13.4). Based on this fact,\nthree radiative properties are defined. First, the spectral\ndirectional absorptance is defined as the fraction of the\nincident radiation that is absorbed for a given direction and\nwavelength. Thus\n\na k; h;/; T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Ik;i;abs k; h;/; T\u00f0 \u00de\nIk;i k; h;/\u00f0 \u00de\n\n: \u00f013:17\u00de\n\nSecond, the spectral directional reflectance is defined as\nthe fraction of the incident radiation that is reflected for a\ngiven direction and wavelength. In this case\n\nq k; h;/; T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Ik;i;reflec k; h;/; T\u00f0 \u00de\nIk;i k; h;/\u00f0 \u00de\n\n: \u00f013:18\u00de\n\nThird, the spectral directional transmittance is defined as\nthe fraction of the incident radiation that is transmitted for a\ngiven direction and wavelength. Thus\n\ns k; h;/; T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Ik;i;trans k; h;/; T\u00f0 \u00de\nIk;i k; h;/\u00f0 \u00de\n\n\u00f013:19\u00de\n\nIn the same way as was done for the emissivity, these\ncoefficients can be integrated to obtain their values for all\ndirections and for all wavelengths. Therefore, the spectral\nhemispherical absorptance is defined as\n\n5800 K\n\n2000 K\n\n1000 K\n\n800 K\n\n300 K\n\n100 K\n\n50 K\n\n0.1 1 10 100\n\n[\u00b5m]\n\nE\nb,\n\n[W\n/(\n\nm\n2\n\u00b7\u00b5\n\nm\n)]\n\n10 8\n\n10 6\n\n10 4\n\n10 2\n\n10 \u20132\n\n10 \u20134\n\n1\n\nFig. 13.6 Spectral emissive power of a black-body, Ek,b, versus\nwavelength, k, according to Eq. 13.12.

If the\nsurface is diffuse, then a k; T\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc e k; T\u00f0 \u00de can be derived\nfrom Kirchhoff\u2019s law.\n\nA surface is defined as \u2018gray\u2019 when its properties are\nindependent of the wavelength, or more particularly that\na\u00f0k; T\u00de \u00bc a\u00f0T\u00de and e\u00f0k; T\u00de \u00bc e\u00f0T\u00de. Most real surfaces are\nnot exactly gray, but the equations will still be valid if the\nproperties do not change with the wavelength in the range\nof interest, that is, in the range of wavelengths where\nradiation exchange takes place.\n\n13.1.2.3 View Factors\nThe view factor, Fij, between two surfaces, Ai and Aj, is\ndefined as the fraction of the radiation leaving surface i that\nreaches surface j. It is also termed the configuration factor\nor the geometrical factor. Mathematically, the view factor\nbetween two diffuse infinitesimal surfaces, dAi and dAj, with\nuniform radiosity can be expressed as\n\ndFij \u00bc\ncos hi cos hj\n\npr2\ndAj \u00f013:23\u00de\n\nwhere r is the distance between both elements, and hi and hj\nare the angles between the normal vector to each surface\nand the line of sight between the elements (Fig. 13.7).\n\nFrom the mathematical definition of the view factor, the\nreciprocal relation, AiFij \u00bc AjFji, can be obtained. This\nexpression is very useful in determining one view factor\nwhen the reciprocal is known.\n\nWhen a set of n surfaces forms an enclosure, the sum-\nmation rule of view factors applies to any of the surfaces. It\nis given by\n\nXn\nj\u00bc1\n\nFij \u00bc 1: \u00f013:24\u00de\n\nNote that the term Fii, the view factor of a surface with\nrespect to itself, may be non-zero if the surface is concave,\nthat is, if the surface can see itself.\n\nThe view factors for very simple geometries can be\nanalytically calculated, although more complex geometries\nwould require the use of numerical methods (in fact, the\ncalculation of view factors is a standard feature of most\ncommercial tools dealing with spacecraft thermal control).\nThe view factors for a number of geometrical configurations\nhave been already calculated and are available in the liter-\nature [5, 7].\n\n13.1.3 In-Orbit Thermal Loads\n\nSpacecraft in orbit receive thermal radiation from three\nprimary sources, reflect part of it back and radiate energy to\nthe cold sink of space. The determination of these external\nthermal loads absorbed by a given spacecraft is an essential\npreliminary task to be carried out when the energy equation\nneeds to be solved to predict the system temperatures. Thus,\nthe change of energy of the spacecraft has to be equal to the\nsum of the power dissipated by the electronics plus the\nabsorbed external thermal loads, minus the energy emitted\nby the spacecraft to the outer space cold sink. Hence, as\nintroduced in Chap. 3, and as shown in Fig. 13.8, the three\nmain sources of incoming energy in a spacecraft are the\nsolar radiation, the albedo radiation, and the planetary\ninfrared radiation. In some missions, other sources of\nexternal heating also have to be taken into account, as is the\ncase of the aerodynamic heating that occurs when a space\nvehicle passes through an atmosphere. This happens, for\ninstance, during the aerobraking phase of a mission to a\nplanet that possesses an atmosphere. In such cases, these\naerodynamic thermal loads have to be carefully analyzed.\nFurthermore, since the design of the thermal control sub-\nsystem has to meet the requirements of all mission phases,\n\nni\n\nnj\n\ndAi\n\ndAj\n\n?i\n\n?j\n\nr\n\nFig. 13.7 Magnitudes to calculate the view factor between two\nelemental surfaces, dAi and dAj, placed a distance r apart. ni, nj, are\nunity vectors normal to the surfaces\n\n378 J. Meseguer et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_3\n\n\nfrom the launch until the end of the operating lifetime, the\natmospheric portion of the launch phase, though short, also\nneeds to be analyzed. In the following, only the three main\nsources of external heating are described. The reader is\nreferred to [8] for a detailed description of atmospheric\nthermal loads.\n\n13.1.3.1 Solar Radiation\nDirect solar radiation is the main source of heating and\npower of most spacecraft. The term solar constant, or solar\nirradiance, is defined as the electromagnetic radiation from\nthe Sun that falls on a unit area of surface normal to the line\nfrom the Sun, per unit time, outside the atmosphere, at one\nastronomical unit (au) [9]. According to [10], and as\nintroduced in Chap. 3, its value is Gs = 1,366.1 W/m\n\n2. A\ntypical margin of \u00b110 W/m2 [11] is applied for thermal\ncalculations to take solar fluctuations into account. These\nfluctuations are due to the natural variability of the solar\noutput during the Sun\u2019s eleven-year cycle, to the slightly\nelliptical orbit of Earth, and to measurement uncertainties.\nThis value of the solar constant is the integrated value over\nthe spectrum. For thermal purposes, the spectral distribution\nof the solar radiation can be considered as a black-body at\n5,781 K. The real irradiation spectral distribution at 1 au\ncan be found in Fig. 3.3, taken from [12]. This spectral\ndistribution fits quite well with the emissive power of a\nblack-body at approximately 5,781 K at the Earth\u2019s distance\nfrom the Sun.\n\nLooking in detail at this distribution, it can be seen that\n99 % of solar radiation is between 0.15 and 10 lm: The\nvisible part of the spectrum is included within this range,\nand it represents 46 % of the total radiation. A further 47 %\nis in the near-infrared range and 7 % is ultraviolet radiation.\nThe maximum is at 0.45 lm:\n\nAt 1 au the apparent diameter of the Sun is 0.5?. This\nmeans that at Earth orbits, for thermal calculation purposes,\nsolar radiation can be considered to be parallel rays. In the\ncase of thermal analysis performed for closer distances to\nthe Sun, as in the case of a thermal study of a Mercury\n\norbiter, the effect of the solar angle may have to be taken\ninto account; mainly for optical devices.\n\nWhen the solar constant, Gs, has to be determined at a\ndistance to the Sun, d \u00bc dsc?S, different from 1 au, it can be\nderived from the solar constant defined at 1 au and the\ndistance from the Earth to the Sun dE?S. Applying the\nconservation of solar power passing through concentric\nspherical surfaces of different diameters, dsc?S, gives\n\nGs dsc?S\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Gs 1 au\u00f0 \u00de\ndE?S\ndsc?S\n\n? ?2\n: \u00f013:25\u00de\n\nValues of the solar constant at different planetary orbits\ncan be found in Table 4.3.\n\nThe calculation with a simple analytical expression of\nthe solar radiation absorbed by a flat surface of area A,\nwhose normal vector forms an angle h with the solar rays is\n\n_QSun \u00bc aGsA cos h \u00f013:26\u00de\n\nwhere a is the solar absorptance of the surface.\n\n13.1.3.2 Albedo Radiation\nAlbedo is the fraction of incident solar radiation which is\nreflected off a planet. Therefore its influence as a thermal\nload is higher for low altitude orbits, and particularly for\nlow Earth orbits (LEO). The albedo coefficient, a, may be\nhighly variable over the planet\u2019s surface, as happens on\nEarth\u2019s surface. Oceans absorb most of the incident radia-\ntion, the local albedo being between 0.05 and 0.10. Ice or\nsnow, for example the Antarctic surface, reflects most of the\nsolar radiation and the local albedo coefficient is about 0.95.\nIn continental areas the albedo can range from small values\nover forests to higher values over desert areas. The presence\nof clouds, mainly the quantity and the type, is also an\nimportant factor that alters the local albedo. An albedo\nvalue of 0.8 is typical for cloudy areas. For thermal design\npurposes of low orbit satellites, mean values can be used\nbecause the changes occur rapidly. The mean value for\nEarth is taken as approximately 0.3 [9]. Geometric and\nBond albedo values (defined in Chap. 4) for each of the\nplanets and for the Moon can be found in Table 4.4.\n\nDue to the roughness of a planet\u2019s surface, the albedo is\nassumed to be diffuse. As an approximation, the spectral\ndistribution of the reflected light is considered to be the\nsame as that of incident light.\n\nWhen determining the thermal loads on a spacecraft,\nalbedo loads are only applicable when the portion of the\nplanet that is seen by the spacecraft is sunlit. The calcula-\ntion is often a complex task usually carried out with the help\nof computer tools. As it applies only to the portion of the\nplanet illuminated by the Sun, its value will depend on the\nsolar zenith angle, that is, the angle between the Sun-planet\n\nEmitted\nradiation\n\nDirect\nsolar flux\n\nAlbedo\n\nPlanet\n\nPlanet\ninfrared\n\nFig. 13.8 Thermal interactions of a space vehicle with the environ-\nment: solar radiation, albedo radiation, planet infrared radiation, and\nspacecraft emitted radiation\n\n13 Thermal Systems 379\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nvector and the planet-spacecraft vector. The orbit angle, b,\nthe minimum angle between the spacecraft\u2019s orbit plane and\nthe Sun-Earth vector, also has to be taken into account. For\nEarth orbits, detailed information on this data and the cor-\nrections that have to be applied to those angles to calculate\nthe albedo coefficient is presented in [13], based on mea-\nsurements of the NOAA and ERBS satellites.\n\nFor simplified analytical estimations, the albedo absor-\nbed energy on a surface of area A can be calculated\nassuming that the planet behaves as a reflecting sphere\n\n_Qalb \u00bc aGsAFsc?P cos / \u00f013:27\u00de\n\nfor ?p=2?/? p=2, where a is the albedo coefficient, Gs is\nthe solar constant, / is the solar zenith angle, and Fsc?P is the\nview factor between the surface and the planet. The angle /\ntakes into account the fact that the albedo is at a maximum at\nthe sub-solar point and it becomes zero when the planet seen\nby the spacecraft is in eclipse. Other simple analytical models\nthat take into account seasonal effects and latitude and lon-\ngitude on the Earth\u2019s surface can be found in [9].\n\nIn the case of Earth orbits, the albedo loads are relevant only\nfor low altitudes. For telecommunications satellites in geo-\nstationary orbits (GEO) these loads are practically negligible.\n\n13.1.3.3 Planetary Radiation\nPlanetary radiation is the thermal radiation emitted by a\nplanet. It is also called outgoing long-wave radiation. It is a\ncombination of the radiation emitted by the planet\u2019s surface\nand by the atmospheric gases. It is diffuse radiation within\nthe infrared part of the spectrum. As is the case with the\nalbedo coefficient, the emission of a planet\u2019s surface varies\nfrom one point to another. For example, on Earth, it\ndepends on the local time, on the presence of water\n(oceans), highly populated areas, desert areas, etc. Detailed\ninformation of these variations on the Earth\u2019s surface and\ncorrelations between the Earth\u2019s infrared radiation and the\nalbedo coefficient are presented in [13].\n\nNevertheless, although planets are not strictly in thermal\nbalance, the solar energy absorbed by a planet is almost bal-\nanced by the emitted radiation, a fact that can be used to\ndetermine a planet\u2019s radiative properties from the energy\nbalance equation. For thermal purposes, the thermal energy\nemitted by planets can be characterized by means of the pla-\nnet\u2019s black-body equivalent temperature. If the albedo coef-\nficient, a, is known, a first estimation of the planet\u2019s equivalent\nblack-body temperature can be obtained by equating the solar\nenergy absorbed by the planet to the emitted energy\n\nGspR\n2\nP 1? a\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 4pR2PP4 \u00f013:28\u00de\n\nwhere r is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and RP is the\nradius of the planet. Note that the resulting temperature is\nindependent of the value of RP, as can be seen in the\n\nequation. Interestingly, for planets like Mercury with a long\nday compared to its year, the assumption of considering a\nsingle temperature to model the thermal behavior of the\nplanet may not work properly, and more complex models\nare necessary. In the case of the Earth, with a mean albedo\ncoefficient a = 0.3, its black-body equivalent temperature is\nTE = 254 K. This corresponds with a flux of 240 W/m\n\n2 on\nthe Earth\u2019s surface. The black-body equivalent temperatures\nfor other solar system planets are given in Table 13.2.\n\nFrom the black-body temperature of the planet TP, the\nplanetary infrared thermal load on a spacecraft surface of\narea A can be calculated from\n\n_Qplanet \u00bc eAFsc?PrT4P \u00f013:29\u00de\n\nwhere e is the infrared emissivity of the spacecraft surface\nand Fsc?P is the view factor between the spacecraft surface\nand the planet.\n\nAs is the case with albedo loads, infrared planetary\nradiation is relevant primarily for low altitude orbits. Its\ninfluence on satellites in geostationary orbits is negligible.\n\n13.2 Thermal Control Technologies\n\nIn the previous section, the theoretical laws and concepts\nthat allow the formulation of the thermal balance of a\nspacecraft, considering it as either a whole system or divi-\nded into different subsystems, was presented. This thermal\nbalance is one of the tasks to be recurrently performed by\nthe thermal control team responsible for the thermal control\ndesign of a spacecraft.\n\nGenerally, the design process of the thermal control\nsystem will require the correction of unbalanced thermal\nloads, which is achieved by using suitable devices that allow\nfor controlling and transmitting, or reducing heat fluxes\nbetween the different parts of the vehicle, and between the\nspacecraft and outer space. Such devices can be grouped\nunder the general label of thermal control technologies,\nsome of them being briefly described in this section (for\nmore detailed information and data on these thermal control\ntechnologies, the reader is referred to [7, 14, 15]).\n\n13.2.1 Thermal Control Surfaces\n\nA satellite beyond the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is in an extreme\nsituation with regard to temperature control. Conduction\nand convection are absent, and therefore radiative exchange\nalone determines the heat fluxes to and from the vehicle.\nIntense solar irradiation, radiative cooling to outer space,\nand internal heat generation determine the equilibrium\ntemperature of a spacecraft. The balance between the solar\n\n380 J. Meseguer et al.\n\n\n\nabsorption and thermal emissivity of the surface is, there-\nfore, crucial, in particular for autonomous parts directly\nexposed to solar radiation and thermally insulated from the\nmain thermal mass of the spacecraft, such as instrument\nbooms.\n\nThe thermal radiation from the satellite is a characteristic\nof its temperature, which is ideally close to room temper-\nature, whose black-body radiation intensity maximum is at\nwavelengths close to 10 lm (Fig. 13.6).\n\nConcerning spacecraft thermal design, the relevant\ncharacteristic of thermal radiation, illustrated in Figs. 13.6\nand 3.3, is that solar radiation energy is concentrated in the\nshort wavelength range, whereas room temperature emis-\nsion is concentrated in the long wavelengths. Therefore, the\nwavelength gap between the maxima of the incoming and\noutgoing radiation offers the possibility of using optical\nselectivity for temperature control.\n\nIn space engineering, the radiation properties of a surface\nare characterized by its total normal solar absorptance, a\n(averaging across the ultraviolet spectrum to the near-\ninfrared), and total hemispherical infrared emissivity, e\n(averaging across the thermal infrared spectrum).\n\nIn a general sense, a coating consists of a layer (or lay-\ners) of any substance upon a substrate. Optical coatings\nhave been used to control the temperature of spacecraft\nsince the first successful orbital flight in 1957. Since then,\ncoating materials have been developed to the point where\nreasonably stable coatings are available that give any\ndesired value of the hemispherical total emissivity, e,\nbetween 0.05 and 0.95 for any desired value of the solar\nabsorptance, a, between 0.05 and 0.95.\n\nWhen thermo-optical properties are considered (absorp-\ntance and emissivity), thermal control surfaces are classified\ninto four basic types: solar reflector, solar absorber, total or\nflat reflector, and total or flat absorber.\n\nFlat absorbers absorb throughout the spectral range, with\nrelatively high solar absorptance and high emissivity.\nAmong them are the so-called black paints. Paints which\nare flat absorbers can be made from black pigments such as\nthe oxides or mixed oxides Cr3O4, Fe2O3?NiO, Fe3O4, or\nMn2O3?NiO, grounded and dispersed in silicone elastomers\nor alkali metal silicate vehicles and applied to the base\nstructure. Through anodizing, it is possible to achieve pro-\ntection against corrosion as well as the desired optical\nproperties.\n\nFlat reflectors differ from flat absorbers in that they\nreflect energy throughout the spectral range (in both the\nsolar and infrared regions). Flat reflectors are presently\nobtained with highly polished metals or with paints pig-\nmented with metal flakes.\n\nSolar reflectors are characterized by small values of the\na=e ratio. Solar reflectors reflect most incident solar energy\nwhile absorbing and emitting infrared energy. Such surfaces\nare useful for coating where low temperatures are needed.\nTypical materials belonging to this type are white paints and\nsecond surface mirrors.\n\nSolar absorbers, absorb solar energy while emitting only\na small percentage of infrared energy (that means high\nvalues of the a=e ratio). Such materials absorb moderate\namounts of solar energy striking their surfaces, but emit\nvery small amounts of infrared radiation. Materials having\nthese optical properties are not common.\n\nThe range of properties available for different types of\nmaterials is summarized in Fig. 13.9. The problem of\nselecting the specific coating for a given a=e ratio is\nsomewhat circumvented by the combination of two or\nmore coatings in a checkerboard or stripe pattern to obtain\nthe desired combination of average absorptance and\nemissivity.\n\nRadiation properties of a large number of suitable\nmaterials for spacecraft thermal control can be found in [17,\n18], and an extended list of coatings is presented in [14]. A\nsummary of absorptance and emissivity values of some\nrepresentative materials is given in Table 13.3.\n\n13.2.2 Multilayer Insulations\n\nA multilayer insulation (MLI), also called a thermal blan-\nket, consists of several layers of closely spaced highly\nreflecting shields, which are placed perpendicular to the\nheat flow direction. The basic aim of MLI is to provide\nradiative insulation working as a multilayer radiative shield.\nEach internal layer is a very thin element (from 7 lm\nthickness) of a plastic material, typically Kapton? or\nMylar?, coated with vacuum-deposited aluminum (VDA)\nor gold (VDG) on both sides for very low emissivity. This\nmirror-like aluminum finish is what makes the sheets highly\n\nTable 13.2 The black-body equivalent temperatures at each of the\nplanets and the Moon\n\nd (au) Rp (km) Tp (K)\n\nMercury 0.387 2,330 442\n\nVenus 0.723 6,100 231.7\n\nEarth 1.0 6,367.5 254\n\nMars 1.521 3,415 210.1\n\nJupiter 5.173 71,375 110.0\n\nSaturn 9.536 60,500 81.1\n\nUranus 19.269 24,850 58.2\n\nNeptune 30.034 25,000 46.6\n\nPluto 39.076 2,930 \u2013\n\nMoon 1.0 1,738 273\n\nDistance to the Sun in au, d; Radius of the planet, Rp; Equivalent\nblack-body temperature of the planet, Tp.

The outer cover is\nusually thicker (from 125 lm) than the internal ones for\nincreased mechanical strength. This external layer is usually\naluminized only on its internal face because aluminum\ndegrades when it is exposed to ultraviolet radiation and the\na=e ratio is too high. This configuration is called a \u2018second\nsurface mirror\u2019. The external layer can be just bare Kapton\nor can be painted, for instance with a black carbon paint, in\norder to avoid undesired reflections. If better mechanical\nproperties are needed, for example, to protect it from mi-\ncrometeoroids, more resistant materials, such as Beta-cloth,\ncan be used for this outer layer. In any case, since the outer\ncover may be exposed to solar radiation, its compatibility\nwith ultraviolet radiation has to be carefully verified.\n\nTo avoid direct contact between shields, and therefore\nheat conduction between sheets, low-conductivity non-\nmetallic spacers are used. In order to make the contact\nminimal, they are usually in the form of a mesh. Typical\nmaterials for this netting spacer are Dacron? (a brand name\nof polyethylene terephthalate, PET or PETE) and Nomex?.\nA typical cross section of an MLI is shown in Fig. 13.10.\n\nThe pile of layers is stacked together by adhesive closing\nflaps or stitches sewn with special non-metallic thread that\nhas to be free of volatile components. Small Kapton pieces\ncan be used to prevent the blanket from tearing due to\ntension in the threads. To close the lateral gaps and avoid\nthe degradation of the internal layers, the outer cover is\nfolded back on the internal layer. The blankets are attached\nto the spacecraft structure using hook-and-pile (i.e. Vel-\ncro?) fasteners and stand-off pins.\n\nProper venting of the MLI should be provided in order to\navoid undue pressure loads on the shields during the ascent\nflight. Otherwise, the blanket would billow out like a bal-\nloon and the dynamic pressure could detach it from the\n\nspacecraft. Thus, to allow proper venting of the blanket the\nsheets are perforated and/or sections of the edging are\nunsealed [19].\n\nIn order to prevent an accumulation of electrostatic\ncharge and the resultant discharges, all the layers of the\nblanket have to be grounded to the spacecraft structure.\n\nDetailed information about multilayer insulation mate-\nrials, assembly and performance can be found in [7, 14, 20].\n\n13.2.3 Radiators\n\nSpacecraft heat is ultimately rejected to space by radiators,\nwhich are systems that take the waste thermal energy from a\nheat source and reject it by radiation to outer space through\nradiating surfaces. Although spacecraft radiators may adopt\nvery different forms (from simple flat-plate radiators\nmounted on the side of a spacecraft to radiating panels\ndeployed after the spacecraft is in orbit), in all cases the\nradiators reject heat by infrared radiation from their sur-\nfaces. Thus, the radiating power depends on the emissivity\nand temperature of the radiating surfaces. Obviously, the\nradiator must reject the spacecraft waste heat, but also any\nradiant-heat loads from the environment or other spacecraft\nsurfaces that are absorbed by the radiator. Most radiators are\ntherefore given surface finishes with high infrared radiation\nemissivity \u00f0e [ 0:8\u00de to maximize heat rejection, and low\nsolar absorptance \u00f0a\\0:2\u00de to limit heat loads from the\nsurroundings.\n\nDepending on how the heat is transferred from the source\nto the radiating surfaces, radiators can be classified as\npassive radiators and active radiators. In the former, the\nconnection between the heat source and the radiating sur-\nface is made either by direct contact or by means of heat\npipes, see Sect. 13.2.6, although phase change capacitors\nare also used, whereas in the latter the thermal link is\nestablished by means of fluid loops, see Sect. 13.2.10, or by\nmeans of fluid loops plus heat pipes.\n\nThe temperature gradients along the radiators also play\nan important role in the heat that the radiator can exchange\nwith space. These gradients are the result of the\n\n1.0\n\n1\n\n6\n\n5\n4\n\n7\n\n8 9\n\n3\n\n2\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\n?\n\n?\n\nFig. 13.9 Ranges of solar absorptance, a, and hemispherical total\nemissivity, e, covered by different thermal control coatings: 1 selective\nblack; 2 black paints; 3 gray and pastel paints; 4 polished metals; 5\nbulk metals (unpolished); 6 sandblasted metals and conversion\ncoatings; 7 metallic coatings; 8 dielectric films on polished metals; 9\nwhite paints, second surface mirrors, metallized polymers [16]\n\nTable 13.3 Absorptance, a, and emissivity, e, values of some rep-\nresentative materials\n\na e\n\nCarbon black paint NS-7 (black coating) 0.96 0.88\n\nCatalac white paint (white coating) 0.24 0.90\n\nElectrodag (conductive paint) 0.90 0.68\n\nBlack (anodized aluminum coating) 0.65 0.82\n\nAluminum polished (metal) 0.14 0.03\n\nAluminum (vapor deposited coating) 0.08 0.02\n\n382 J. Meseguer et al.\n\n\n\ncombination of heat conduction along the radiator and the\nactual heat radiation to space of each part of the radiator,\nleading to less than expected heat rejection values. Typi-\ncally, this effect is measured by a figure of merit called the\n\u2018radiator efficiency\u2019, which is calculated as the ratio\nbetween the real heat radiated to the sink (considering the\nactual temperature distribution field along the radiator) and\nthe heat that the radiator at constant maximum temperature\nwould exchange with the sink. The main parameters that\ndrive the radiator efficiency are thermal conductivity,\nradiator thickness, emissivity, and working temperature.\n\n13.2.4 Louvers\n\nThermal louvers are active thermal control surfaces whose\nradiation characteristics can be varied in order to maintain\nthe proper temperature of a component which experiences\ncyclical changes in the amount of heat that it absorbs or\ngenerates. This is normally achieved by means of blades\nwhose orientation with respect to a fixed baseplate can be\nadjusted (see Fig. 13.11).\n\nLouver systems can be made for shadow or sunlight\noperation. In the first case, heat is radiated through the\nlouver to the outer skin of the spacecraft, while in the\nsecond the excess heat is transferred from the emitting\nbaseplate to outer space.\n\nLouvers are composed of five main components: the\nbaseplate, blades, actuators, sensing elements, and structural\nelements.\n\nThe baseplate is a surface of low absorptance-to-emis-\nsivity ratio which covers the critical set of components\nwhose temperature is being controlled.\n\nThe blades, driven by the actuators, are the elements of\nthe louvers which give variable radiation characteristics at\nthe baseplate. When the blades are closed, they shield the\nbaseplate from the surroundings, while when they are fully\nopen, the coupling by radiation of the baseplate to the\n\nsurroundings is at its maximum. The radiation characteris-\ntics of the baseplate can be varied in the range defined by\nthese two extreme positions of the blades.\n\nThe actuators are the elements of the louvers which drive\nthe blades according to the temperature measured by sen-\nsors placed in the baseplate. Up to now, the actuators of the\nlouvers used on satellites have been bimetal spirals or bel-\nlows, although other types could be used, such as Bourdon\nspirals, and electrical devices. In a single actuation system\nall the blades are driven by the same actuator. In the mul-\ntiple blade actuator system several actuators are required to\noperate the system. Generally, bimetals are used in a mul-\ntiple blade actuation system, and bellows in a single blade\nsystems. Some recent missions like ESA\u2019s Rosetta space-\ncraft use also trimetallic coil spring actuators [21].\n\nThe sensing element senses the temperature of the\nbaseplate and activates the actuators, which control the\nblades accordingly. The type of sensing element depends on\nthe kind of actuator. When the actuator is a bimetal, the\nsensing element is the bimetal itself. If the actuators are\nbellows or Bourdon, the sensing element can be a tank or a\ntube containing either a liquid or a liquid\u2013vapor mixture,\nand soldered to the baseplate.\n\nOuter cover Ground conection\n\nNetting spacers\n\nInternal layers Washers15-25 layers\n\nVelcro fasteners\nTo satellite ground\n\nInner cover\n\nFig. 13.10 Sketch of a typical\nmultilayer insulation\n\nB RH\n\nFig. 13.11 Schematic diagram of a louver (Venetian blind type):\nR radiator; H housing; B blades\n\n13 Thermal Systems 383\n\n\n\n13.2.5 Mechanical Interfaces\n\nWhen two solids are brought into contact and heat is con-\nducted from one to the other, a resistance to heat transfer\nappears in the interface caused by the inherent irregularities\nof the contacting surfaces. Each surface, no matter how well\npolished it is, consists of peaks and valleys as shown in\nFig. 13.12. The actual solid-to-solid contact area is only a\nsmall fraction of the total apparent contact area. Voids\nformed by valleys are either empty in a vacuum environ-\nment or filled with gas in the presence of an atmosphere, the\ngas contributing little to the conduction of heat. The\nmajority of the heat flow is constrained to the areas of solid-\nto-solid contact and gives rise to the observed temperature\njump across the interface. This resistance to heat transfer is\ncalled the joint resistance or thermal contact resistance and\nthe inverse value is the thermal contact conductance.\n\nNumerically the thermal contact conductance is quanti-\nfied as follows. Consider two solid rods A and B, of section\nA, with their ends kept at different temperatures T1A and\nT2B, as indicated in Fig. 13.13. Their lateral surfaces are\nthermally insulated so that heat conduction is one-dimen-\n\nsional. The heat flux is _Q. Macroscopically, in steady-state\nconditions, a temperature jump DTc is observed in the\ncontact plane. The thermal contact conductance hc is\n\ndefined as hc \u00bc _Q= ADT\u00f0 \u00de, and the thermal contact resis-\ntance is the inverse value Rc \u00bc 1=hc. When the apparent\narea of contact cannot be easily identified (as for instance in\na bolted joint), the thermal contact conductance is not\n\ndefined per unit area, but simply hc \u00bc _Q= DT\u00f0 \u00de.\nThe thermal contact conductance is a fairly complex\n\nphenomenon, influenced by the contact pressure, the finish\nof the surface, and the mechanical properties of the con-\ntacting solids: the modulus of elasticity and the hardness.\nThe design of the joints can be adapted to the thermal\nnecessities of the system; if insulation is needed, bad cou-\nplings are sought, and if it is necessary to spread heat, good\nthermal couplings will have to be achieved.\n\nA number of models are available in the literature to\npredict the thermal contact conductance between surfaces.\nDepending on the type of joint the models are organized in:\nbare or filled joints, in vacuum or in atmospheric environ-\nment, and in bolted or just pressed joints. A good compilation\nof the existing models can be found in [14].\n\nThermal fillers are materials used to fill the voids formed\nby the surface peaks and valleys appearing in the contact\nregion when two materials are brought into contact, thereby\nenhancing the heat transfer. A sketch of how the interface is\nmodified when a thermal filler is used is shown in\nFig. 13.12. Thermal fillers are usually made of soft mate-\nrials with high thermal conductivity, and in some cases also\nhigh electrical impedance so that they can provide electrical\nisolation. The main types of materials used as thermal fillers\nare graphite foils, elastomeric thermal fillers consisting of a\nthermoset elastomeric binder containing a dispersed highly\nthermally conductive ceramic filler, and room temperature\nvulcanizing (RTV) materials that also act as adhesive\nmaterials.\n\n13.2.6 Heat Pipes\n\nThe heat pipe is a thermal device which allows an efficient\ntransport of thermal energy. It consists of a closed structure\ncontaining a working fluid which transfers the thermal\n\n(a)\n\n(b) (c)\n\nFig. 13.12 a Schematic representation of two surfaces in contact\nwith a heat flow across the interface; b Two surfaces with\n\nuncompressed thermal filler; and c the surfaces with compressed\nthermal filler.

Meseguer et al.\n\n\n\nenergy from one part (evaporator) to another (condenser),\nsee Fig. 13.14. The phenomena involved in the transfer\nprocess are the following: (1) vaporization in the evapora-\ntor; (2) vapor flows in the core region of the container; (3)\ncondensation in the condenser, and (4) liquid return to the\nevaporator by capillary action in the wick.\n\nBecause the pressure variations in the vapor core are\nnormally small, the heat pipe temperature is nearly uniform\nand similar to the saturated vapor temperature correspond-\ning to the vapor pressure. The capability to transport a large\namount of thermal energy between two terminals (evapo-\nrator and condenser) with a small temperature difference is\none of the main characteristics of heat pipes, which can be\nconsidered extra-high thermal conductivity devices in terms\nof Fourier\u2019s law. Their transport capacity is 4\u20135 orders of\nmagnitude higher than that of a copper rod with the same\nmass.\n\nHeat pipes can be made into different shapes, and by\nusing the working fluid best suited to the desired tempera-\nture range, can operate at temperatures ranging from the\ncryogenic regions to high temperature levels which are only\nlimited for structural reasons.\n\nPumping can be obtained by using wicks, grooved tubes,\nand arteries. The primary requirement for a heat pipe wick\nis that it should act as an effective capillary pump. That is,\nthe surface tension forces developed between the fluid and\nthe wick structure should be sufficient to overcome all\nviscous and other pressure drops in the pipe while main-\ntaining the required fluid circulation.\n\nGrooved tubes, with channels running axially along the\ninner surface of the tube, are structurally stable, have a large\npipe wall to wick thermal conductance, and allow an easy\ncontrol of pore size during manufacturing.\n\nThe condensed liquid can be delivered to the evaporator\nthrough one or more cylindrical arteries, which are placed\nnear the pipe centerline, and are extensions of the wick\ncovering the inner wall of the pipe.\n\nA wide variety of fluids ranging from cryogens to liquid\nmetals have been used as heat pipe working fluids, like\nammonia, ethanol, Freon 11 (trichlorofluoromethane, also\n\ncalled CFC-11, or R-11), methanol, nitrogen, propane,\nwater (saturated).\n\nMore details on heat pipes basics and applications can be\nfound in [22].\n\n13.2.7 Phase-Change Materials\n\nSolid\u2013liquid phase-change materials (PCM) present an\nattractive choice for passive thermal control of a spacecraft\nwhen the incident orbital heat fluxes or the on-board\nequipment heat dissipation fluctuate widely. Basically, the\nPCM thermal control device consists of a container that is\nfilled with a substance capable of undergoing a phase\nchange. When the temperature of the spacecraft surface\nincreases, either because of external radiation or inner heat\ndissipation, the phase-change materials will absorb the\nexcess heat through melting, and will restore it through\nsolidification when the temperature decreases again.\n\nTo control the temperature of cyclically operating\nequipment, the phase-change material cell is normally\nsandwiched between the equipment and the heat sink.\n\nContainers of PCM primarily differ in their outer shape\n(circular or rectangular), and in the flexible element which\nmay be used for compensating the volume variation of the\nmaterial during the phase change. The flexible elements of\nthe container may be metallic bellows, metallic membranes,\nor rubber diaphragms.\n\nWhen a rigid container is used it is necessary to provide\na void or gas volume for expansion of PCM during melting.\n\nThe incorporation of thermal fillers into PCM systems\noffers distinct advantages, the primary one being the\nimprovement of the thermal conductivity of the phase-\nchange materials which, if not metallic, have low\nconductivities.\n\nWhen fillers are not used, the temperature at the heated\nsurface of the PCM may rise far above its melting point,\nwith solid material still available but thermally isolated\nfrom the heated surface. However, when a metal filler is\nused, thermal gradients in the phase-change material bulk\n\nE C R\n\nCG NCG\n\nFig. 13.14 Sketch of a variable conductance heat pipe: E evaporator; C condenser; R non-condensable gas reservoir; CG condensable gas; NCG\nnon-condensable gas [7]\n\n13 Thermal Systems 385\n\n\n\nare considerably reduced because of the high thermal con-\nductivity of the filler.\n\nA compilation of commercially available PCM systems\nand the materials they use can be found in [23].\n\n13.2.8 Heaters\n\nReliable long-term performance of most spacecraft com-\nponents takes place in a specified temperature range. The\nattainment of some temperature range requires, in many\ninstances, the generation of heat within the spacecraft. In\nthese cases, heaters are sometimes required to fulfill specific\nrequirements like the protection of components for low\ntemperatures, to provide precise temperature control for\ndevices or components, or to warm up equipment to its\noperating temperature.\n\nWhen a local uniform heat source or a profiled heating\narea is needed, electrical heaters can provide heat efficiently\ndue to their versatility, although other types of heaters\n(chemical or nuclear) are also used in spacecraft. Obvi-\nously, the use of electrical heaters requires the availability\nof a power source. For near-Earth applications, solar power\nprovided by photovoltaic devices is the preferred option\nbecause of the relative proximity of the Sun. However,\nwhen spacecraft missions must be performed far from the\nSun or into harsh environments (such as the surface of Mars\nor in certain lunar locations), reliable, long-life electrical\nand thermal power sources independent of the Sun are\nneeded (e.g. radioisotope heaters).\n\nElectrical heaters are based on Ohm\u2019s and Joule\u2019s laws.\nTwo types of heater typically used on spacecraft are film\nheaters (or patch heaters) and cartridge heaters. By far the\nmost commonly used type is the film heater due to its\nflexibility, which means it can be installed on flat and\ncurved surfaces. These are made of electrical resistance\nfilaments sandwiched between two layers of electrically\ninsulating material, such as Kapton, attached to leads.\n\nIn a radioisotope heater unit, the heat is produced from\nthe natural decay of the radioisotope (alpha particles in the\ncase of Plutonium-238). In this case, the waste heat from a\nradioisotope source is recovered by the spacecraft to pro-\nvide additional thermal control for the avionics and instru-\nmentation without resorting to additional electrical heaters.\nThese heaters place the heat of radioactive decay directly\nwhere it is needed. Additional information on radioisotope\nheaters can be found in [24].\n\n13.2.9 Heat Switches\n\nHeat switches cannot really be classified as heaters, but their\nability to adjust to variations in heat dissipation rates makes\n\nthem an attractive option for temperature control in modern\nsatellites. If a heat switch connects an electronic component\nto a radiator, heat is removed from the device when it is\ngenerating large amounts of energy and conserved when the\ndevice is not producing heat, allowing the device to remain\nin the desired temperature range. Therefore, heat switches\ncan passively control the temperature of warm electronics\nor instrumentation without the use of thermostats and\nheaters, thereby reducing power requirements.\n\nIn paraffin thermal switches, the volume change of par-\naffin, which expands approximately 15 % when it melts,\nfacilitates heat switch operation. Under normal operating\nconditions, a paraffin heat switch contains a mixture of solid\nand liquid wax. In addition, a gap exists between the two\ndevices connected by the paraffin heat switch. Due to the\nvacuum in the gap, heat transfer across the heat switch is\nlimited to radiation across the gap and conduction through\nthe support structure. When heat is added to the heat switch,\nit is absorbed as latent heat and melts some of the remaining\nsolid paraffin. The melted paraffin expands and closes the\ngap that previously separated the hot and cold sides of the\nheat switch, enabling conduction across the entire heat\nswitch surface. As more heat is added, more paraffin melts\nand the pressure at the contact between the hot and cold\nsides increases, causing an increase in conductivity.\n\nAnother type of thermal switch is the differential thermal\nexpansion heat switch. This uses two materials with dif-\nferent coefficients of thermal expansion to control contact\nbetween the cold and hot sides of the switch. Additional\ndetails on thermal switches can be found in [25].\n\n13.2.10 Fluid Loops\n\nThe aim of the fluid loop is to keep the temperature of a\ngiven component within the range that guarantees its correct\nfunctioning. To achieve this, the heat flow rate evacuated\nmust be equal to the heat rate dissipated by the component,\nplus that coming from external sources.\n\nIn a fluid loop, the fluid is in motion, absorbing the heat\nat a relatively steady rate from the component whose tem-\nperature is to be controlled, and transferring it to a heat sink\nthat can be separated from the source (Fig. 13.15). Heat\ntransfer can be achieved through sensible heat change. A\nliquid or gas phase is used to transfer heat according to the\n\nequation _Q \u00bc _mcpDT . In order to increase the heat transfer\nrate, _Q, either the mass flow rate, _m, or the temperature\ndifference, DT, has to be increased for a particular fluid (the\nspecific heat, cp, is more or less the same for all liquids and\ngases at normal conditions).\n\nForcing of the fluid through the duct can be performed by\nuse of a pumping device (e.g. a centrifugal or positive\ndisplacement pump), normally driven by an electric motor.\n\n386 J. Meseguer et al.\n\n\n\nAccording to their working mode, fluid loops may be\nregarded either as thermal insulators (when the aim is to\nprotect the component against a thermally hostile environ-\nment), or as thermal acceptors (transferring the excessive\nthermal energy from the component to the thermal sink).\n\nThe coolant may circulate through a single-walled\nchamber enclosing the component, or through a double-\nwalled component heat exchanger package. The single-\nwalled jacket affords more efficient heat transfer than the\nheat exchanger, but the fluid can contaminate, corrode or\nchemically react with the materials of the component that is\nbeing thermally controlled.\n\nThe heat rejection depends on whether the coolant is\nexpendable or non-expendable. An expendable coolant is\nrejected from the vehicle once it has accomplished its\nmission, while a non-expendable coolant is recirculated\nafter losing its excess thermal energy to space via a radiator.\n\nWhen cryogenic cooling below 70 K is required, direct\nradiation to space is almost impossible. Because of this, the\nfluid loop incorporates a refrigerating system (Brayton,\nStirling, or Vuilleumier cycles) which compresses the gas at\nan ambient temperature and then expands it at a lower\ntemperature. During the expansion, heat is added to the gas\nproviding the required cooling.\n\nThe fluid flow concepts and the performance of different\nfluid loop systems are extensively described in [7].\n\n13.2.11 Thermoelectric Cooling\n\nThermoelectric coolers are solid-state devices that work as\nsmall heat pumps. They obey the laws of thermodynamics\njust as do conventional mechanical heat pumps (refrigera-\ntors), absorption refrigerators, and other devices involving\nthe transfer of heat.\n\nUsing thermoelectric cooling in space applications has\nsome advantages, mainly those regarding a flexible and\n\neasy-to-control thermal regulation system. However, due to\nits low efficiency it is mostly suitable for localized cooling\nfor temperature control of a single component, rather than a\nmain cooling method for an entire system.\n\nA thermoelectric cooler [26] consists of a type N and a\ntype P semiconductor (such as of bismuth telluride) as\nshown in Fig. 13.16. A junction between these dissimilar\nsemiconductors is formed at the surface to be cooled and a\nDC voltage is applied across the other junction at the hot\nsurface where heat is transferred to the surroundings. The\nextra electrons in the N type material and the holes left in\nthe P type material are the carriers that transfer the heat\nfrom the cold to the hot junction. The heat is pumped by\nvirtue of the Peltier effect.\n\nThermoelectric elements are usually connected thermally\nin parallel and electrically in series to obtain the required\npower handling capacity.\n\n13.2.12 Cryogenic Cooling\n\nSystems that work under 100 K are called cryogenic sys-\ntems. This temperature limit is typical of instruments\ndevoted to Earth observation (infrared detectors) or gamma\nray, high energy or infrared astronomy.\n\nThe most critical cryogenic cooling requirements in\nspacecraft subsystems come from instruments carrying\ndetectors that have to work at very low temperatures. A\ndetailed review of non-military space missions carrying\ncryogenic instruments is reported in [27, 28]. An overview\nof the cryogenic systems either for Earth or for space\napplications already developed or under development in\nEurope can be found in [29]. A comparative diagram of the\napplicability of several cryogenic cooling systems is shown\nin Fig. 13.17, outlining the region in the cooling power-\ntemperature plane where these systems are placed.\n\nGenerally speaking, a cooling system provides a heat\nsink, evacuating the heat from the cool side of the equip-\nment toward a hot part, where heat is dissipated. In the case\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 13.15 Schematic representation of a fluid loop showing the main\ncomponents: a heat exchanger, b pump, and c heat source\n\nHA\n\nHL\n\nHS DC\n\nCO CO\n\nCS\n\nCS\nCO\n\nEL\nP N\n\nFig. 13.16 Schematic of a thermoelectric cooling element: CO,\ncopper plate; CS, ceramic substrate; DC direct current; EL electrons;\nHA heat absorbed; HL holes; HS heat sink; N, P, type N and type P\nsemiconductors, respectively [26]\n\n13 Thermal Systems 387\n\n\n\nof a spacecraft, isolated in space, the evacuated energy is\nradiated to space either directly or by pumping energy to a\nhigh temperature level to radiate this energy more easily to\nspace. In this second case, the heat pumping process can be\nperformed following either a closed loop cycle or an open\nloop cycle (Table 13.4). Obviously, the final energy trans-\nference to space has to be performed using a radiator.\n\nAn open cycle involves the use of stored cryogenic\nmaterials, liquid or solids. In this case the work needed is\nperformed on Earth, before the mission, in the liquefaction\nprocess (or solidification, as appropriate) of the working\nfluid. The cold heat sink is generated by the evaporation of\ncryogenic solids or liquids. In the open cycle systems, there is\nno heat radiation, although the gas generated by evaporation\nhas to be evacuated. Thus, the system lifetime is driven by the\nheat losses and the cryogenic material stored on board.\n\nIn the closed cycle systems, mechanical coolers are\nemployed, where work is continuously performed during\noperations.\n\n13.2.13 Thermal Protection Systems\n\nThe thermal protection system (TPS) of a space vehicle\nensures the structural integrity of its surface and maintains\nthe correct internal temperatures (for crew, electronic\nequipment, etc.) when the vehicle is under the severe\nthermal loads of reentry. These loads are characterized by\nvery large heat fluxes over the relatively short period of\nreentry. The heat fluxes acting on the TPS are so large\nbecause of the great speeds of reentry vehicles. For\ninstance, the Space Shuttle velocity goes from approxi-\nmately 8 km/s at an altitude of 100 km to 2 km/s at 50 km.\n\nGenerally speaking, the thermal protection system con-\nsists of a material system (shield and/or load carrying\nmember) operating on a given heat dissipation principle.\n\nThere are several thermal protection system concepts for\nreentry vehicles [30].\n\nAblative systems operate by dissipating the incident\nthermal energy through the loss of material. They have good\nthermal characteristics since phase changes absorb a large\namount of energy. This concept has been widely used in\nmost of non\u2013reusable entry vehicles, for its simplicity and\nits high performance. It has been used in planetary probes\n[31], ballistic missiles and space capsules. See Fig. 13.18\nfor a sketch of an ablative system. Materials commonly\nused can be composites (carbon phenolic, silica phenolic,\nphenolic nylon), ceramics (graphite), metals (graphite) or\nplastics (silicone polymers, Teflon?\u2014a brand name of\npolytetrafluoroethylene, AVCOAT or glass-filled epoxy-\nnovolac).\n\nRadiative systems operate by re-emitting the radiation\nenergy received from the surrounding environment by the\nsolid walls. They are composed of two layers: an outer\nlayer, which consists of a refractory material that can stand\nthe radiation equilibrium temperature, and an inner layer\nthat insulates the outer layer from the structure in order to\nminimize the heat flow between the two, see Fig. 13.18. In\nthese systems energy absorption is generally much smaller\nthan for ablative systems.\n\nCommonly used external insulators can be divided in\ntwo classes: rigid and flexible. Rigid insulators can adopt\ndifferent shapes: tiles, shingles, shells, and boxes. They can\nbe made out of composites (carbon/carbon, carbon/silicon\ncarbide) or ceramics (sintered alumina/silica fibers, sintered\nhigh-purity silica fibers). This type of insulation is used to\nprotect areas exposed to the highest temperatures. Flexible\ninsulators are blankets of different materials: silica fiber,\nglass fiber, alumina/silica fiber, alumina/borosilicate fiber,\nNomex? fiber, alumina fiber plated with rhodium, and\nnylon. These materials are processed into fleeces, felts or\nthreads, which then form the blankets.\n\nTranspiration systems are systems where fluid (H2O,\nNH3, CF4, CO2) is injected through a porous medium into\nthe boundary layer [32]. The structure is maintained cool by\nexploiting two basic mechanisms. Firstly, heat is conducted\nto the coolant as it flows through the structure, and then as\nthe coolant is ejected out the surface it reduces the surface\n\nQ\n[W\n\n]\n\nT [K]\n10\u20133 10\u20131\n\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5 6\n\n7\n8\n\n103\n\n104\n\n10\u20134\n\n10\u20138\n\n10\u201312\n\n100\n\n10\n\nFig. 13.17 Operational ranges of several cryogenic systems.

See Fig. 13.18 for a sketch.\n\nIn some applications, the shape change caused by the\nsurface recession of an ablating surface is not acceptable\nfor, say, aerodynamic performance reasons. In such cases, if\nthe environment is too severe for radiative or heat sink\nsystems, transpiration cooling may be the only practical\nsolution. This thermal protection system makes possible\nsuitable performance in environments that could not\notherwise be withstood. However, its mechanical com-\nplexity, with the associated reliability problems, tends to\nlimit its use.\n\n13.3 Thermal Control Design, Analysis\nand Testing\n\n13.3.1 Thermal Control Design\n\nThe aim of a thermal control system (TCS) is to maintain all\nthe components on-board the spacecraft within the allowable\ntemperature limits by using the minimum spacecraft\nresources and controlling the heat fluxes through interfaces,\nas per equipment specifications. Furthermore, it has to\nguarantee the optimal performance of components in oper-\national conditions. Besides keeping temperatures within\nranges, the aim of the TCS is also to minimize temperature\ngradients according to specified limits and to guarantee\ntemperature stability for optics, opto-mechanical devices,\nand any other components sensitive to temperature. This has\nto be done for all mission phases and the possible degradation\nthat can be caused by the in-orbit environment (e.g. atomic\n\noxygen, ultraviolet radiation), wear and mechanical loads,\nhas to be taken into account during the design process.\n\nThe two main tasks under the responsibility of the thermal\ncontrol system team are: the definition of the thermal hard-\nware of the spacecraft and the prediction of the temperatures\nachieved throughout the orbit, and the identification of the\nrelevant parameters that have influence on the thermal\nbehavior of the spacecraft in order to find an optimal solution\ncompatible with the limitations given by the spacecraft\nresources.\n\nThe component requirements have to be defined for the\ndifferent modes of operation of the spacecraft. They include\noperational mode, start-up, and survival conditions. In this\nlast case, the goal of the thermal control system is to avoid\ndamaging the equipment.\n\nThe thermal requirements in operational conditions of\ntypical spacecraft equipment are listed in Table 13.5. Note\nthat these are just typical values, shown as examples. For a\ngiven mission, the thermal requirements of the equipment\nand platform have to be specified because the requirements\ndepend on the specific components used.\n\nThe thermal control system usually requires specific\nthermal hardware that has to be taken into account in the\ncorresponding budgets. Minimum mass, power, and size\nhave to be used as baseline criteria for this hardware defi-\nnition, provided that reliability and safety requirements are\nfulfilled.\n\n13.3.1.1 Design Process\nThe thermal control system design process consists of two\nmain tasks. On the one hand, the appropriate thermal\nhardware for the spacecraft has to be selected. On the other,\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 13.18 a Sketch of an\nablative thermal protection\nsystem; b a radiative thermal\nprotection system; c a\ntranspiration thermal protection\nsystem\n\n13 Thermal Systems 389\n\n\n\nthe temperatures of the different parts of the spacecraft have\nto be calculated for different heat load cases, verifying that\nthe thermal requirements are met.\n\nThere are many types of space missions and payloads,\nwhich means that the design of the spacecraft, and in par-\nticular of the thermal control system, has to be tailored for\neach type of mission. Hence, most communication satellites\nin geostationary orbits may be based on the same design\nphilosophy whereas the mission requirements for low Earth\norbit satellites or interplanetary spacecraft have a lot of\ninfluence on the system design.\n\nThe prediction of temperatures is obtained by solving the\nenergy balance equation applied to the spacecraft. Obvi-\nously, the temperature distribution strongly depends on the\nthermal hardware used. Therefore, before carrying out any\ncalculations, it is necessary to define an initial thermal\nhardware configuration of the spacecraft. This is commonly\ndone based on engineering experience. For example, it is\ncommon practice to insulate the spacecraft from outer space\nusing multilayer insulations (MLI). This helps to lessen the\neffect of the very variable environmental conditions on the\nequipment. In order to allow the rejection to space of the\npower that is internally dissipated, some radiators, located on\nthe outer surface of the spacecraft subjected to lower envi-\nronmental loads, facing deep space as much as possible, are\nappropriately sized. The thermal couplings between the inner\nequipment and the radiators are determined accordingly to\nenable the heat flux between dissipating devices and radia-\ntors. With the initial \u2018guessed\u2019 hardware, based on prior\nexpertise, the temperatures of the spacecraft are determined\nand, depending on these results, the thermal hardware is\nmodified until the requirements are met. The design process\n\nis therefore an iterative process that has as its output the\nspacecraft thermal hardware configuration and the space-\ncraft\u2019s temperature predictions. Furthermore, this iterative\nprocess involves not only the thermal control system but also\nother subsystems of the spacecraft. Indeed any change in the\nhardware may have direct implications in the mechanical and\nstructural design, and the need for heaters has direct impact\non the power management subsystem and the electronics and\non-board data handling subsystems.\n\nIn the first loop of the iterative process, temperatures are\ncalculated from semi-analytical simulations. This is always\ndone in the early phases of a mission when the concept of\nthe spacecraft is still not completely defined and detailed\ngeometric information is still not available (phases 0, A and\nB, see Sect. 2.3.2: Fig. 2.9 and Table 2.2, and Sect. 7.2: Fig.\n7.6 and Table 7.5). In these phases, it is common practice to\nwork in parallel with more than one spacecraft configura-\ntion and apply trade-offs to select the final concept. How-\never, due to the complexity of space systems and the\ncapabilities of modern computers, very often simple\nnumerical models are also used for trade-offs and parameter\nsensitivity analysis. Once the detailed definition phase starts\n(end of phase B and phase C), thermal calculations are\nalways performed with complex numerical simulations that\nenable the determination of the spacecraft temperature field.\nSpecific software tools, like for instance ESATAN or\nSINDA, are used for this purpose.\n\nThe inaccuracies of the design process (due to simplifi-\ncations in the geometry, uncertainties in the properties of\nsurfaces and materials, etc.) are also palliated by applying\nsafety margins to the results predicted with the numerical\nmodels. Thus, the temperature range predicted with the\nmodels is enlarged with a margin that depends on the design\nphase and the level of detail of the models. In early phases\nof the design a typical uncertainty of \u00b115 K is applied, but\nthis margin may be reduced to \u00b15 K after the mathematical\nmodels have been correlated with measured data obtained\nduring the thermal balance tests. Figure 13.19 shows the\nphilosophy of margins applied to the calculated temperature\nrange in order to define the different levels of testing\n(qualification and acceptance tests), according to [33].\n\nThe major factors driving the thermal control system\ndesign are\n\n\u2022 The spacecraft environment, which drives the external\nloads.\n\n\u2022 The heat dissipated by the equipment on-board the\nspacecraft.\n\n\u2022 The distribution of the thermal dissipation within the\nspacecraft.\n\n\u2022 The temperature requirements of the spacecraft components.\n\u2022 The configuration of the spacecraft: geometry, materials,\n\nmounting systems, etc.\n\nTable 13.5 Typical temperature ranges for some spacecraft equipment\n\nTemperature ranges\n\nElectronics (housing) (-10 ?C, +50 ?C)\n\nBatteries (0 ?C, +20 ?C)\n\nSolar arrays (-100 ?C, +120 ?C)\n\nAntenna dish (-65 ?C, +95 ?C)\n\nHydrazine tank (+10 ?C, +50 ?C)\n\nInfrared detectors (-223 ?C, -173 ?C)\n\nInactive structure (-100 ?C, +100 ?C)\n\nTemperature gradients\n\nOpto-electronic equipment DT \\ 5 ?C\n\nHigh resolution cameras DT \\ 0.1 ?C\n\nDetectors (CCD) DT \\ 0.01 ?C\n\nTemperature stability\n\nElectronics dT/dt \\ 5 ?C/h\n\nDetectors (CCD) dT \\ 0.1 ?C during observation\nperiods\n\n390 J.

The thermal control system\nhas to fulfill thermal requirements over all mission phases.\nThis includes ground operations (integration, testing, stor-\nage, and shipping) and flight activities (launch, transfer\norbits, cruise, final orbit, etc.). In order to size the thermal\ncontrol system, the worst case scenarios, those leading to\nthe extreme thermal loads, have to be identified. Once\nidentified, the so-called hot cases and cold cases are defined\nfor operating, start-up, and survival conditions of equip-\nment. These dimensioning cases are defined by an appro-\npriate combination of external fluxes (solar, albedo, and\nplanetary infrared), material properties, and unit dissipation\nprofiles. Normally, the hot case corresponds to the maxi-\nmum external loads and maximum internal dissipation. The\nmaximum external loads usually occur at the sub-solar point\nin a planetary orbit or at perihelion in a solar orbit. The cold\ncase usually corresponds to eclipse zones for planetary\norbits and to aphelion for a solar orbit. Modes of operation\nwith minimum dissipation are chosen to assess the cold\ncases.\n\nA common philosophy in spacecraft thermal control is to\ndesign the thermal subsystem for the hot operational case.\nHowever, as the radiator sizes selected for the hot case\ncould lead to extremely low temperatures when the space-\ncraft is exposed to cold conditions or the equipment is off,\nelectrical substitution heaters are appropriately sized and\nlocated for these cold situations.\n\nThe degradation of surface properties, for instance the\nincrease of solar absorptance values, a, with prolonged\nexposure to solar radiation, also has to be taken into\naccount. End of life (EOL) property values have to be used\nfor thermal calculations corresponding to the hot cases,\nwhereas beginning of life (BOL) property values have to be\nused to define the cold cases.\n\nSince the dimensioning loads are defined for the worst\ncase scenarios, steady-state calculations under these con-\nditions are carried out. This is a conservative approach that\nsimplifies the calculations and provides the upper and lower\nlimits that temperatures can reach.\n\nRegarding the different mission phases, the thermal\ncontrol system is usually designed for the cruise and nom-\ninal orbit, making it compatible with ground operations and\nthe ascent phase.\n\n13.3.2 Thermal Mathematical Models\n\nThermal modeling is the major task in thermal control\nsystem design.\n\nThe thermal modeling process requires approximating\nthe physical system by a mathematical representation, that\nis, a set of numbers that represent the system from the\nthermal point of view. The first step in the mathematical\nprocedure is to set up the so-called geometrical mathe-\nmatical model (GMM). This representation of the geometry\nof the system is necessary to compute the external thermal\nloads on the outer surfaces and the radiation exchange\nbetween different parts of the spacecraft. It is usually a\nsimplified geometry, where irrelevant details from the\nthermal point of view are excluded.\n\nOnce a basic geometry for thermal analysis is defined,\nthis geometry is discretized in a network of nodes. To do\nthis, the basic geometric shapes that comprises the geo-\nmetrical mathematical model are meshed. Each node is an\nisothermal element characterized by its temperature, Ti, and\nits thermal capacitance, Ci. This numerical approach is\ncalled a lumped parameter network because the continuous\nparameters of the thermal system have been lumped into the\ndiscrete set of nodes.\n\nThe energy equation for each node can be written as\n\nCi\ndTi\ndt\n\u00bc _Qsun;i \u00fe _Qalb;i \u00fe _Qplanet;i \u00fe _Qdis;i \u00fe\n\nXn\nj\u00bc1\n\nKij Tj ?

T4i\n\n? ?\n\n\u00f013:30\u00de\n\nwhere, _Qsun;i; _Qalb;i; _Qplanet;i are the external thermal loads at\nnode i for solar, albedo, and planetary infrared respectively,\n_Qdis;i is the power dissipated at node i, and Kij and Rij are the\n\nQualification margin\n\nThermal control system requirements\nThermal control \n\nsystem performance\n\nUncertainties\n\nAcceptance margin\n\nDesign\ntemperature\nrange\n\nPredicted\ntemperature\n\nrange\n\nCalculated\ntemperature\n\nrange\n\nAcceptance\ntemperature\nrange\n\nQualification\ntemperature\nrange\n\nFig. 13.19 Temperature\nmargins definition for thermal\ncontrol subsystem\n\n13 Thermal Systems 391\n\n\n\nconductive and radiative links or couplings between nodes,\nrespectively. Note that Kij \u00bc Kji and Rij \u00bc Rji. Thus, the\nterm\n\nPn\nj\u00bc1 Kij\u00f0Tj ? Ti\u00de represents the conduction heat\n\nreceived by node i from the rest of the neighboring nodes j,\nand\n\nPn\nj\u00bc0 Rij\u00f0T4j ? T4i \u00de represents the net radiation\n\nexchange on node i.\nNote that in the last term of Eq. 13.30, node 0 represents\n\nouter space. Thus, a radiative link between the spacecraft\nand outer space is taken into account whereas a conductive\nlink is not considered.\n\nWhen Eq. 13.30 is applied to all the nodes that the\nspacecraft is divided into, a system of ordinary differential\nequations is obtained and its solution allows the temperature\nof such discrete points to be determined. This means that in\norder to determine the temperature of the satellite, two\nmatrices of coefficients (conductive and radiative thermal\ncouplings) and four vectors (solar, albedo, Earth infrared,\nand internal dissipation thermal loads) of Eq. 13.30 are\nnecessary. These matrices and vectors constitute a mathe-\nmatical representation of the thermal model of the space-\ncraft by concentrated thermal capacitance nodes, coupled\nby a network made of thermal conductors (mainly radiative\nand conductive). That is why that set of numbers is called\nthermal mathematical model (TMM).\n\nFor thermal control system dimensioning, as said above,\nsteady-state calculations for the worst-case hot and cold\nscenarios are performed. This is done by setting the left\nhand side of Eq. 13.30 to zero. When applied to all the\nnodes, this constitutes a system of algebraic non-linear\nequations that can be solved to obtain the temperature dis-\ntribution for such extreme cases. In fact, what is solved in\nthis case are simple heat flux balances. It is obvious that\nprior to the resolution of the equation it is necessary to\nobtain the thermal loads and the matrices of thermal cou-\nplings. These temperatures are the upper and lower limits\nthat may be encountered during the mission. It is important\nto point out that the thermal design is usually obtained from\nthese steady calculations whenever there are no stringent\nstability requirements.\n\nOnce a feasible thermal control system design based on\nthe previous steady-state calculations is found, transient\nanalyses are performed to determine the changes of tem-\nperatures over time and to verify the fulfillment of stability\nrequirements. In this case, the system of equations is gen-\nerally integrated using the Crank\u2013Nicholson method.\n\n13.3.3 Thermal Control Testing\n\nTests are needed as part of the verification process of the\nspacecraft thermal control system, together with the anal-\nysis with the mathematical models that have been described\npreviously.\n\nThermal control testing covers different objectives\n\u2022 To confirm that the system will operate satisfactorily at\n\nexpected (or more extreme) operating temperatures.\n\u2022 To evaluate the ability of the thermal control system to\n\nmaintain the spacecraft thermal environment within\nestablished structural, experimental, and subsystem tem-\nperature limits.\n\n\u2022 To verify the validity of the mathematical model.\nDifferent types of test are required to accomplish these\n\nobjectives. The first one is achieved by means of a thermal\nvacuum test, and the other two by the so-called thermal\nbalance test. According to [33], conformance to specified\nperformance has to be demonstrated by performing thermal\nbalance, thermal vacuum, and climatic tests at all temper-\nature ranges.\n\nThe test levels in thermal balance testing are set to sim-\nulate the external environment (solar radiation and deep\nspace) or to approximate the anticipated energy flux levels at\nthe boundaries of the spacecraft. These levels are then used in\nthe mathematical model in order to permit valid comparison\nwith the test. For thermal vacuum testing, temperatures are\nset equal to or higher than expected flight temperatures by a\ngiven margin. For both types of testing, the component\nelectrical dissipation rates and duty cycles are set to values\nappropriate to the mission mode being tested. In some cases,\nit may be both technically and economically advantageous to\nperform a combined thermal balance and thermal vacuum\ntest. Test conditions have to be agreed with the system\nauthority and included in the system test plan.\n\n13.3.3.1 Model Philosophy (Structural Thermal\nModel, Qualification Model, Flight\nModel)\n\nThermal testing is performed at various stages of spacecraft\ndevelopment according to the needs of the particular program.\n\nThe verification by testing (see Chap. 7) is implemented\non the selected models chosen for the project or the model\nphilosophy adopted. The model philosophy is defined by\nmeans of an iterative process that combines programmatic\nconstraints, verification strategies, and the integration and\ntest programs, taking into account the development status of\nthe candidate design solution.\n\nGenerally, the qualification, acceptance and proto-flight\ntest activities are distributed among the different models.\nThis sharing depends on the model philosophy, the project\ncharacteristics, and the model representativeness.\n\nThe hardware models related to the verification of the\nthermal control system are\n\u2022 The thermal model (or structural-thermal model STM)\n\u2022 The qualification model (QM)\n\u2022 The flight model (FM)\n\u2022 The proto-flight model (PFM).\n\n392 J. Meseguer et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_7\n\n\nFor instance, the main purpose of qualification thermal\nvacuum testing performed on either the structural-thermal\nmodel (STM) or qualification model (QM) is to detect the\nadverse effects on spacecraft performance that could result\nfrom any existing weakness in the thermal design. The\npurpose of acceptance thermal vacuum testing is to reveal\nadverse effects arising from defects in materials or work-\nmanship in the flight model related to the thermal design.\nBoth types of testing involve the collection and analysis of\nspacecraft performance data; the role of the thermal control\nengineer is to ensure that the spacecraft is exposed to the\nspecified environments.\n\n13.3.3.2 Development Tests\nThermal testing is addressed in [33] at the component and\nsystem (space vehicle) level. Besides these two levels,\nspecial tests may be necessary at other assembly levels. In\naddition, dedicated tests may be required to provide confi-\ndence in a new design or to aid the analysis. Development\ntests can provide early data to assist in the design or man-\nufacturing process. For instance, thermal cycling test are\nused to demonstrate the ability of equipment to fulfill all\nfunctional and performance requirements over the qualifi-\ncation temperature range at ambient pressure.\n\n13.3.3.3 Thermal Vacuum Tests\nThe thermal vacuum testing is performed at the component,\nsubsystem, and integrated spacecraft levels. At the com-\nponent level, the testing is generally performed at the\nmanufacturer\u2019s facility to ensure that the unit meets its\nreliability and quality assurance requirements.\n\nAt the subsystem level, there are design qualification and\nflight acceptance tests. The purpose of the design qualifi-\ncation test is to prove the component design by checking its\nperformance capability in a vacuum under temperature\nstress more severe than predicted for the mission. A pro-\ntotype component is generally used for design qualification\ntesting. The flight acceptance test is performed on a flight\nmodel component and its purpose is to locate latent material\nand workmanship defects in a component of proven design\nby checking its performance capability in a vacuum at the\ntemperature extremes expected in flight.\n\nThe purpose of acceptance testing on the flight model of\nthe spacecraft is to check the interaction between subsys-\ntems as well as to ascertain the proper operation of all\nsystems.\n\nTest durations for acceptance thermal vacuum testing\nmust be long enough to demonstrate that the unit can sur-\nvive the launch and flight. Test times for qualification\ntesting are not as easily defined, because testing is not\nperformed on a flight unit and the test levels are more severe\nthan encountered in flight.\n\n13.3.3.4 Thermal Balance Tests\nThermal balance testing for design or development is per-\nformed to provide design information on those components\nfor which the thermal design is difficult to analyze, stringent\ntemperature constraints are imposed, or it is necessary to\nestablish the feasibility of the design approach. Thermal\nbalance testing is also conducted for design verification.\n\nAccording to [33], for thermal control system items\ncontrolled by radiative and conductive heat exchange, a\nthermal balance test has to be performed in order to\n\u2022 Provide data for the verification of the thermal mathe-\n\nmatical model as part of the thermal control system\nqualification.\n\n\u2022 Demonstrate the suitability of the thermal control system\ndesign.\n\n\u2022 Verify the performance of thermal control system\nhardware\n\n\u2022 Provide data about the sensitivity of the thermal control\nsystem design to parameter changes (for example, heat\ndissipation).\nThermal balance testing is generally performed on items\n\nat high integration levels, such as spacecraft, service mod-\nule, payload module, or instruments.\n\nThe test instrumentation and the test set-up to be used\nmust be defined in the test specification and agreed with the\nsystem authority; for example, temperature sensors and\nheaters with adequate number and position.\n\nThe thermal balance test has to provide accurate and\nreliable input data for the thermal model correlation [33].\nTwo different steady-state test cases have to be performed.\nA transient case has to be included for items that are sen-\nsible to dynamic behavior.\n\nThe duration of thermal balance testing can be deter-\nmined in two ways: (1) the test conditions are established\nand held until the test article reaches temperature stabil-\nization, and (2) the test conditions are varied to simulate\ntransient conditions in the same time frame as expected in\nflight.\n\n13.3.3.5 Test Facilities\nThermal tests are performed in vacuum chambers where the\ntemperature and heat flux can be controlled. There are\nseveral different methods for simulating flux in thermal\nbalance testing. Heating can be provided by means or\nelectrical heaters or halogen lamps. For cooling, liquid or\ngaseous nitrogen are normally used to achieve the low\ntemperatures found in space.\n\nTemperature conditioning in thermal vacuum testing is\nusually accomplished by varying the test chamber wall\ntemperature or by monitoring the test article on a temper-\nature controlled baseplate. The test specimen is heated by\nradiation when the purpose is to simulate space conditions,\nnormally for full spacecraft tests or for equipment located at\n\n13 Thermal Systems 393\n\n\n\nthe outer part of the vehicle (antenna reflectors, solar panels,\netc.). Test specimens representing equipment located inside\nthe satellite are heated by conduction through the baseplate\non which the equipment is mounted.\n\nTests are often performed without regard to possible\nerrors in the test chamber. The consequent test results could\ndictate an unnecessary redesign or confirm thermal ade-\nquacy of a deficient design.\n\nThere are several sources of error associated to the test\nfacility and test set-up\n\u2022 Conduction transfer from the fixtures used in mounting\n\nand supporting test articles in the chamber.\n\u2022 Infrared energy inputs to test articles from the chamber\n\nand reflection from chamber walls and fixtures.\n\u2022 Monitoring errors (calibration and measurement).\n\u2022 Thermal losses to wiring.\n\u2022 Deviation from the programmed cycle, or simulation\n\nerrors.\n\nAcknowledgments Except Figs. 13.15 and 13.18, all the figures of\nthis chapter are from [15] and the authors are indebted to Woodhead\nPublishing Ltd. for their permission.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

A satellite communications system, as\nshown in Fig. 14.1, includes a ground segment and a space\nsegment. The ground segment consists of Earth stations/\nterminals which provide direct communications, including\ntelemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C), to the space\nsegment and network control center(s), which provide the\nnetwork management and traffic control. A space segment is\none or more spacecraft on-orbit which provides one or all of\nthe following functions: (a) communications relay; (b)\ncommunications signal processing and traffic switching/\nredirection; and (c) data collection and transmission to\nground stations. See Chap. 2 for a more detailed discussion\nof ground and space segments.\n\nWhile there are many satellites in various Earth orbits,\nthe most common systems use satellites in geostationary\nEarth orbit (GSO or GEO). As detailed in Sect. 4.4.3, this\nunique orbit is in the equatorial plane at an altitude of\napproximately 36,000 km, where the orbit period is equal to\nEarth\u2019s sidereal rotation period of approximately 24 h. As\nsuch, GEO satellites appear stationary when view by a\nground observer.\n\nThe concept of the geostationary communications satel-\nlite was apparently first introduced by the Austro-Hungarian\nrocket engineer and pioneer of cosmonautics Herman\nPotoc?nik (pseudonym Hermann Noordung; 1892\u20131929) in\nhis book Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums\u2014der\nRaketen-Motor (The problem of space travel\u2014the rocket\nmotor) [1]. It should however be noted that it was, most\nlikely, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857\u20131935), who first\nconceived of the concept of a geostationary orbit. Potoc?nik\nfirst recognized the advantages of a spacecraft in such an\norbit for communications and Earth observation. Later, in\n\nOctober 1945, Arthur C. Clarke (1917\u20132008), published an\narticle titled Extra-terrestrial Relays in the British magazine\nWireless World [2]. The article described the fundamentals\nbehind the deployment of artificial satellites in geostationary\norbit for the purpose of relaying radio signals and, in effect,\nintroduced the concept into the Western literature. Although\nClarke is often credited with being the inventor of the\ncommunications satellite, his true influence is unclear [3].\n\nTelstar was the first active, direct relay communications\nsatellite; see Fig. 1.7. It was launched by NASA from Cape\nCanaveral on July 10, 1962, as part of a multinational\nagreement between AT&T, Bell Telephone Laboratories,\nNASA, the British General Post Office, and the French\nNational PTT (Postes, t\u00e9l\u00e9graphes et telephones) to develop\nsatellite communications. Telstar was placed in an elliptical\norbit with an apogee of 6,000 km and a perigee of\n1,000 km, giving an orbit period of 2 h and 37 min, in a\nplane inclined at 45? to the equatorial plane.\n\nHughes\u2019 Syncom-2, launched on July 26, 1963, revolved\naround the Earth once per day at a constant speed, but\nbecause its orbital plane was inclined to the equator it had a\nnorth\u2013south motion as seen from the ground, and special\nequipment was needed to track it. The first truly geosta-\ntionary satellite was Syncom-3, launched on August 19,\n1964. It was placed in orbit at 180? east longitude and was\nused to relay experimental television coverage of the 1964\nSummer Olympics from Tokyo, Japan, to the United States,\nmaking these Olympic Games the first to be broadcast\ninternationally.\n\nOn August 20, 1964 The International Telecommunica-\ntions Satellite Consortium (INTELSAT) was established on\nthe basis of agreements signed by governments and oper-\nating entities, with the goal of establishing a global satellite\nsystem. Shortly after, Intelsat-1, also known as Early Bird,\nwas launched on April 6, 1965 and placed in orbit at 28?\nwest longitude. It was the first commercial geostationary\nsatellite for telecommunications over the Atlantic Ocean,\n\nA. Atia ? H.

On July 1, 1969 the world\u2019s\nfirst global satellite communications system was complete\nwith the Intelsat-3 satellite covering the Indian Ocean\nregion. The 1970s was a decade of expansion in which\ncommercial global communications via the Intelsat system\ngreatly expanded, and several domestic satellite systems\n(Weststar, RCA-Satcom and Anik for Canada, Telstar and\nComstar in the US, and Palapa in Indonesia) were estab-\nlished. The early era of the 1970s was all C-band (6/4 GHz)\nsatellite systems. The experimental communications tech-\nnology satellite Communications Technology Satellite, also\nknown as \u2018Hermes\u2019 launched in 1976 demonstrated the\ncommercial viability of the 14/12 GHz Ku-band for direct-\nto-home (DTH) satellite broadcasting. This gave rise to an\nupsurge of the 14/12 GHz satellites in the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe Ku-band frequency continues to be the most sought\nafter by service providers. The 1980s and 1990s were\ndecades where commercial satellite communications and\nDTH broadcasting by satellites expanded through the\nintroduction of more advanced technologies that resulted in\nmore powerful satellites and more efficient use of the\navailable frequency spectrum. Deregulation of telecommu-\nnications worldwide resulted in the establishment of many\nnational and regional satellite systems. The 21st century is\nwitnessing the evolution of satellite communications into an\nessential part of everyday life: the Internet, mobile com-\nmunications, increasingly high definition television broad-\ncasting, etc. Satellites became much more powerful with the\nintroduction of many new technologies that enabled the use\nof more frequency bands and orders of magnitude of\nincreased communications capacity and throughput.\n\nMajor commercial satellites manufacturers include As-\ntrium, Boeing Satellite Systems (formerly Hughes), Lock-\nheed Martin Space Systems, Orbital Sciences Corporation,\nSpace Systems/Loral, and Thales Alenia Space. Other\nmanufacturers vying for the commercial market are China\nGreat Wall Industries, ISRO of India, and Melco of Japan.\n\n14.1 Frequency Spectrum and Bands\nAllocations\n\nThe frequencies used for satellite communications are\nmainly determined by three factors\n1. Absorption by the atmosphere as a function of fre-\n\nquency\u2014The average atmospheric absorption varies as a\nfunction of frequency at different altitudes above sea\nlevel, along with the effects of rain and fog. The\nabsorption has peaks due to different molecules in the\natmosphere at particular frequencies. Usually these fre-\nquencies are avoided for communications applications,\nthough in special cases they may be deliberately used so\nthat the signal will not propagate beyond a certain\nrange\u2014e.g. covert military signals, or mobile commu-\nnications where the limited frequency range available\nmeans that the same frequency may be reused many\ntimes in different communications cells. Frequency\nbands for satellite communications were allocated to lie\nwithin windows of least atmospheric absorption.\n\n2. International agreements/regulations\u2014The use of dif-\nferent frequency bands for different applications\nhas been agreed through various international agencies.\n\nUplink\n\nDownlink Inter-satellite links\n\nGround\nStation\n\nGround \nStation\n\nGateway and/or\nTT&C Station\n\nSpace Segment\n\nGround Segment\n\nFig. 14.1 A satellite\ncommunications system\nconsisting of a ground segment\nand a space segment\n\n398 A. Atia and H. Yao\n\n\n\nThe International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is\nthe specialized agency of the United Nations that is\nresponsible for information and communication tech-\nnologies. ITU coordinates the shared global use of the\nradio spectrum, promotes international cooperation in\nassigning satellite orbits, works to improve telecommu-\nnication infrastructure in the developing world, and\nestablishes worldwide standards. It also publishes the\nRadio Frequency Regulations, which contain detailed\nallocations of frequency bands for all telecommunica-\ntions applications, both terrestrial and satellite-based.\n\n3. The antenna size needed to produce a beam with the\nrequired angular spread\u2014The basic (approximate) rela-\ntionship between wavelength and antenna size is h (radi-\nans) ? k=D where h is the angular breadth of the main\nbeam between the 3 dB points, which is often referred as\nbeamwidth, and D is the maximum dimension across the\nantenna aperture. A satellite\u2019s antenna size must be cho-\nsen to produce the required coverage, and to fit inside the\nlaunch vehicle. An Earth station\u2019s antenna size must be\nchosen to produce the narrowest possible beamwidth\ncapable of providing an adequate gain for communicating\nwith the desired satellite and to avoid unwanted interfer-\nence to and/or from satellites that may be in nearby orbit\nlocations. For commercial applications, such as DTH, the\nantenna size must be as small as possible for economic\nreasons. At low frequencies, the wavelength is large and a\nlarge antenna is necessary to avoid interference. As the\nfrequency increases, the beamwidth reduces for a given\nantenna size but the attenuation of the atmosphere\nincreases, suggesting that the antenna gain should be\nhigher, possibly necessitating a larger aperture. A\n\ncompromise must be made. Note that atmospheric atten-\nuation is not a problem for satellite-to-satellite links, so\nthese may involve millimeter-wave frequencies and very\nsmall antennas.\nTable 14.1 provides information about the most common\n\ndesignations for the satellite frequency bands. The radio\nfrequency allocations in the US can be found in a com-\nprehensive chart at the NTIA web site [4].\n\n14.2 Communications Systems Overview\n\nThere are several ways to classify satellite communications\nsystem architectures. The specific architecture is chosen\naccording to the intended satellite communications services.\nThese services may include two-way voice, two-way bal-\nanced data, services associated with very small aperture\nterminals (VSAT), video distribution to cable head-ends,\nDTH broadcasting, multimedia Internet access (two way\nunbalanced data), and mobile communications [5].\n\nThe basic satellite architectures are designated as non-\nprocessing (bent-pipe) or processing. A bent-pipe satellite\nsimply takes the uplink signal from Earth, converts it to a\ndownlink frequency, and amplifies it for transmission back\nto the Earth, possibly cross-connecting subchannels to other\ndownlink antenna beams. A processing satellite may actu-\nally separate and demodulate the uplink signals and route\nthe baseband signals to other beams, upconvert them to the\ndownlink frequency band and send them down on the\nappropriate beams. Both processing and non-processing\nsatellite architectures include antennas for receiving and\n\nTable 14.1 Radio frequency bands for space communications\n\nFrequency band designation Uplink frequency\nbands\n\nDownlink frequency\nbands\n\nApplication\n\nUHF 225\u2013460 MHz 225\u2013400 MHz Military, Mobile Satellite Service (MSS)\n\nL-Band 1,610\u20131,660 MHz 1,525\u20131,559 MHz MSS\n\nS-Band 2.65\u20132.69 GHz 2.48\u20132.65 GHz Fixed Satellite Service (FSS), MSS, research\n\nC-Band (including extended\nC-Band)\n\n5.85\u20136.7 GHz 3.4\u20134.8 GHz FSS\n\nX-Band 7.9\u20138.4 GHz 7.25\u20137.75 GHz FSS, military communication, and Earth observation\nsatellites\n\nK and Ku-Band 12.75\u201314.8 GHz 10.7\u201312.7 GHz FSS, Broadcast Satellite service (BSS)\n\n17.3\u201318.4 GHz 17.7\u201318.4 GHz\n\nKa-Band 27\u201331 GHz 18.4\u201322.0 GHz FSS, MSS, research, and Intersatellite links\n\n31.8\u201332.3 GHz\n\nQ-Band 40.5\u201343.5 GHz 37\u201342.5 GHz BSS, FSS, BSS, and research\n\nV-Band 46\u201356 GHz BSS, MSS, Intersatellite links\n\nW-Band 56\u2013100 GHz Intersatellite links, FSS, and MSS\n\n14 Communications Systems 399\n\n\n\nReceiver\n\nReceiver\n\nIn\npu\n\nt M\nul\n\ntip\nle\n\nxe\nr\n\nO\nut\n\npu\nt M\n\nul\ntip\n\nle\nxe\n\nr\n\nO\nut\n\npu\nt R\n\ned\nun\n\nda\nnc\n\ny \nS\n\nw\nitc\n\nh \nN\n\net\nw\n\nor\nk\n\nIn\npu\n\nt R\ned\n\nun\nda\n\nnc\ny \n\nS\nw\n\nitc\nh \n\nN\net\n\nw\nor\n\nk\n\nInput\nFilter\n\nReceive (Rx)\nAntenna\n\nTransmit (Tx) \nAntenna\n\nHigh Power Amplifier\n(HPA)\n\nHPA\n\nG\nai\n\nn \nC\n\non\ntr\n\nol\n A\n\ntte\nnu\n\nat\nor\n\nINPUT/RECEIVE SECTION OUTPUT/TRAMSMIT SECTION\n\nFig. 14.2 Simplified functional block diagram of a bent-pipe communications payload\n\nAnalogue/Digital \n(A/D)\n\nConversion\n\nChannel\nDe-multiplexing\n& Multicarrier\nDemodulation\n\nMulti-rate\nDecoding\n& Stream \nFormatting\n\nBaseband\nSwitching\n\nChannel\nFormatting,\nEncoding\n\n&\nModulation\n\nDigital/Analogue\n(D/A)\n\nConversion\n\nFig. 14.3 Architectural block of a regenerative processor\n\ntransmitting in either broad spatially shaped beams, cover-\ning large regions of the Earth (for example, the continental\nUnited States or Europe), or in narrow spot beams to cover\nsmaller regions.\n\nMost GEO communications satellites employ the non-\nprocessing, channelized communications system architec-\nture. In this architecture, the satellite receives signals from a\nground station, amplifies the signals, changes their carrier\nfrequencies, subdivides the received spectrum into several\nchannels (transponders), power amplifies each of these\nchannels, combines (multiplexes) the amplified channels\nand retransmits the combined signals to the receiving\nground stations. Figure 14.2 shows a typical bent-pipe non-\nprocessing payload.\n\nProcessing payload architectures have been developed\nand used for specialized applications ranging from mobile\nnarrowband connectivity [4], to wideband Internet/data\nconnections, to Digital Video Broadcasting by Satellites\n(DVB-S) [6]. Processing payloads can be regenerative or\ntransparent (non-regenerative). The regenerative on-board\nprocessors demodulate the signals and manipulate the\nbaseband bits to perform baseband switching and routing. A\ntypical architectural block diagram of a regenerative on-\nboard processor\u2019s functions is shown in Fig. 14.3. Trans-\nparent processing payload architectures are used to digitally\nroute, interconnect, and switch narrowband analog channels\nfrom a large number of uplink beams to a large number of\n\ndownlink beams [7]. Such architectures are typically used in\nmobile satellite systems.\n\nThe main advantage of regenerative processing payloads\nover bent-pipe payloads is the fact that processing payloads\nseparate the uplink and downlink noise signals, thus\nimproving the overall satellite link quality. In addition, the\nability to route and switch signals on-board the satellite\nprovides a significant advantage for satellite networks such\nas Spaceway. These advantages are at the expense of a\nmuch more complex payload, heavier mass, and greater\npower consumption. In addition, regenerative processing\npayloads are uniquely designed to operate with specific\ncommunications protocols, thus limiting their operational\ncapabilities to these specific protocols.\n\nAnother architectural aspect for communications satel-\nlites is how users are connected to other users, or to infor-\nmation sources. Figure 14.4 illustrates the three common\nconnectivity architectures for communications satellites\n1. Two way symmetric or \u2018one-to-one\u2019 (Fig. 14.4a), where\n\nthe amounts of information exchanged between any pair of\nusers is almost equal. Each user terminal has both\nreceiving and transmitting capability. The network inter-\nconnections can be a mesh topology (i.e. the nodes/\nterminals in the same network can communicate with each\nother via a single relay link through the satellite) or a star\ntopology (i.e. all signal transmissions to and from an\nindividual node/terminal must be routed through a central\n\n400 A. Atia and H. Yao\n\n\n\nlocation or hub via multiple relay links through the satel-\nlite). The mesh network connectivity can be established\neither by ground hub control stations for bent-pipe satel-\nlites, or by on-board processors for processing payloads.\n\n2. Broadcasting or \u2018one-to-many\u2019 (Fig. 14.4b), where\ninformation flows one way from the broadcasting\ntransmitting station to all of the receiving users. The\nusers terminals have only receive capability.\n\n3. Multimedia Internet Access Architecture (Fig. 14.4c),\nwhere two-way unbalanced or \u2018many to one\u2019 intercon-\nnectivity is used. The users terminals have both receive\nand transmit capability. The forward links (gateways to\nusers) have much higher capacity/bandwidth than the\nreturn links (users to gateways).\n\n14.3 Communications Link and Performance\n\nA satellite communications system consisting of a space\nsegment and a ground segment is depicted in Fig. 14.1. For\nany satellite mission to be functional, control and/or mission\n\ninformation has to be exchanged between the two segments\nthrough the communications link in the form of information\nbearing radio frequency (RF) signals. As discussed in the\nfollowing sections, the performance of a communications\nlink is primarily determined by (a) the RF signal power\ntransmitted in the direction of the receiver, (b) the loss of\nRF energy in the transmission media, and (c) the ability of\nthe receiver to convert the incoming RF signal from a given\ndirection into electrical energy.\n\nThe control information (i.e. the telecommands) usually\noriginates from the TT&C station. The mission information\ncan be originated either from the ground segment, as it is\nfor the communications satellite systems, or from the\nspace segment, as it is for the sensor/exploring satellite\nsystems.\n\nA complete satellite communications link is composed of\none or more link segments, such as an uplink from a ground\nstation to a satellite, a downlink from a satellite to a ground\nstation, and/or an inter-satellite link. The radio frequency\nbands commonly used for space communications links are\nsummarized in Table 14.1.\n\nUser A User B\n\nSatellite Satellite\n\nUsers\nBroadcasting \nUplink Station\n\nSatellite\n\nUsers Gateway Station\n\nForward Link\n\nReturn Link\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 14.4 Three common\nconnectivity architectures for\ncommunications satellites. a Two\nway architecture symmetric one\nto one VSATs. b Broadcasting\narchitecture one way (one to\nmany). c Multimedia internet\naccess architecture two way\nunbalanced (many to one)\n\n14 Communications Systems 401\n\n\n\n14.3.1 Communications Link Elements\n\nGenerally speaking, there are three major elements in any\ncommunications link, including satellite uplink and down-\nlink, as shown in Fig. 14.5: a transmit system, the trans-\nmission media, and a receive system.\n\n14.3.1.1 Transmit System\nThe transmit system for a satellite uplink is an Earth station\nand for a satellite downlink it is the satellite. The primary\nfunction of a transmit system is to amplify an information\nbearing RF signal to a proper level through a high power\namplifier (HPA), and then to radiate the signal to trans-\nmission media (atmosphere and space) through a transmit\nantenna. The transmit system in an Earth station or a pro-\ncessing satellite usually also includes the units for encoding\nthe baseband source information and modulating it onto an\ninformation bearing RF signal prior to routing that to the\nHPA for high power amplification.\n\nAn important figure of merit of a transmit system is its\nequivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) which is a\nproduct of the transmit antenna gain (GT) and the RF signal\npower delivered by the high power amplifier to the antenna (P)\n\nEIRP \u00bc GT ? PT : \u00f014:1\u00de\n\nThe EIRP is usually expressed as 10 log(P) ? 10\nlog(GT) and then has units of dBW; i.e. dB relative to 1 W.\nFor a given set of source encoding and modulation\nparameters, including forward error correction in order to\nprovide signal redundancy, the EIRP directly influences the\nlink performance and the capacity of the communications\nsystem. It is one of the most important parameters in the\n\ndesign considerations and trade-offs for any space com-\nmunications system due to its critical influence on the\ncommunication link performances/capability and to the\nexpensive nature of the DC power in a spacecraft. The\ndetails of microwave antennas and high power amplifiers\nare described later in this chapter.\n\n14.3.1.2 Receive System\nThe receive system for the uplink is the satellite and for the\ndownlink it is the Earth terminal. The receive system\naccepts the information-bearing RF signal through a receive\nantenna and passes it to a low noise amplifier to minimize\nthe noise contributions of downstream circuitries. When the\nreceive system is the Earth terminal, it demodulates the RF\nsignal into the baseband form suitable for end users. A\nfigure of merit for a receive system, whether it be the\nsatellite or the Earth terminal, is the ratio of its antenna gain\n(GR), expressed as a numerical ratio, to its system noise\ntemperature (TS) in kelvins. The gain to noise temperature\nratio (G/T) is usually expressed as the dB difference of\nantenna gain in dBi (dB with respect to isotropic) and noise\ntemperature in dBK, as G/T(dB/K) = 10 log(GR) - 10\nlog(TS). For a given set of transmission parameters, the G/T\ngoverns the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) at the input of the\nreceive system and, consequently, significantly influences\nthe performance and capacity of the overall link.\n\nThe system noise temperature, measured in kelvins, is\ndue to an effective noise temperature (Te) generated by the\ninternal sources such as the receiver (i.e. the low noise\namplifier and frequency converter) and the input passive\ncomponents, as well as by an antenna noise temperature\n(Ta) generated from external sources in the field of view of\n\nInformation \n\nCoding\n(rate Rb) \n\nModulation\n(rate Rs) \n\nRF High Power \nAmplifier (HPA)\n\nM\nul\n\ntip\nle\n\nxe\nr/\n\nC\nom\n\nbi\nne\n\nr\n\nFrequency\nConverter\n\nTransmit\nAntenna\n\nGT\nLNA and \n\nFrequency \nConverter\n\nDe-multiplexer/Channelizer\n\nDeodulation\n(rate Rs) \n\nDecoding\n(rate Rb) \n\nInformation \n\nTransmission Media\n(distance d)\n\nReceive\nAntenna\n\nGR\n\nRF Power\nPT\n\nSystem  \nNoise\n\nTs\n\nReceive \nPower\n\nPR\n\nBaseband units in Ground Segment or \nprocessing payloads in Space Segment\n\nFig. 14.5 A typical\ncommunications link\n\n402 A.

In practical applications, the thermal\nnoise power is the ultimate limit to the communications\nperformance and capacity for any communications system\nbased on Shannon\u2019s information theorem [8].\n\n14.3.1.3 Noise from Internal Sources\nA receive system is composed of many active and passive\ncomponents (including connecting lines). The equivalent\nnoise temperature is defined at the input of each component.\nFor an active component\n\nTr \u00bc T0 F ? 1\u00f0 \u00de \u00f014:3\u00de\n\nwhere F is the noise figure of the active component and T0\nis a normal ambient temperature of 290 K based on the\nnoise figure definition. And for a passive component\n\nTL \u00bc T L? 1\u00f0 \u00de \u00f014:4\u00de\n\nwhere L is the loss of the passive component expressed as\nthe numerical ratio of the input power to the output power\n(L C 1) and T is the physical temperature of the passive\ncomponent. For a general cascaded network with n active/\npassive components, each has gain of gi (for a passive\ncomponent, g = 1/L) and the equivalent noise temperature\nof Ti as shown in Fig. 14.6, the total noise power that is\ngenerated by all the components and which appears at the\noutput of component n is\n\nNoutn \u00bc kT1B\nYn\ni\u00bc1\n\ngi \u00fe kT2B\nYn\ni\u00bc2\n\ngi \u00fe ? ? ? \u00fe kTnBgn: \u00f014:5\u00de\n\nThe equivalent noise power of the overall cascaded\nnetwork referenced at the input of component 1 can be\nobtained as\n\nNin1 \u00bc kTeB \u00bc\nNoutnQn\ni\u00bc1 gi\n\n\u00bc kB T1 \u00fe\nT2\ng1\n\u00fe ? ? ? \u00fe TnQn?1\n\ni\u00bc1 gj\n\n !\n: \u00f014:6\u00de\n\nTherefore, the overall equivalent noise temperature (Te)\nfrom all the internal sources of a cascaded network, refer-\nenced at the input of the very first component, is\n\nTe \u00bc T1 \u00fe\nXn\ni\u00bc2\n\nTi=\nYi?1\nj\u00bc1\n\ngj\n\n !\n: \u00f014:7\u00de\n\nIn fact, the equivalent noise temperature may be refer-\nenced at any point in the cascaded network. For example,\nthe equivalent noise temperature of the network referenced\nat the input of component i can be derived as\n\n\u00f0Te\u00dei \u00bc\nXi?1\nj\u00bc1\n\nTj ?\nYi?1\nk\u00bcj\n\ngj\n\n !\n\u00fe Ti \u00fe\n\nXn\nj\u00bci\u00fe1\n\nTj=\nYj?1\n\nk\u00bci\ngj\n\n !\n:\n\n\u00f014:8\u00de\n\nWith this concept, it can be easily proved that the G/T of\na receive system is independent of the reference point of the\nG/T calculation.\n\n14.3.1.4 Noise from External Sources\nThe noise collected from the noise sources in the field of\nview of the receive antenna is the dominant contributor to\nthe antenna noise temperature. The antenna noise temper-\nature can be expressed as the convolution of the antenna\npattern g\u00f0X\u00de and the brightness temperature T\u00f0X\u00de of\nexternal noise sources as follows [9]\n\nTa \u00bc\n1\n\n4p\n\nZZ\ng\u00f0X\u00de ? T\u00f0X\u00de ? dX \u00f014:9\u00de\n\nwhere dX represents an infinitesimal element of solid angle\nin the direction of the noise source in the antenna coordinate\nsystem. The external noise sources include the stars, back-\nground cosmic noise, and absorbent media such as atmo-\nspheric attenuation. For a communications link between the\nground segment and the space segment, the antenna noise\ntemperature is dominated by the Earth brightness tempera-\nture and/or the atmospheric brightness temperature\ndepending on the main direction of the receive antenna\nbeam. For a downlink, the receive antenna (an Earth station\nantenna) is pointed \u2018upward\u2019 to a spacecraft and the main\nnoise source is the atmospheric attenuation (i.e. the sky\nbrightness temperature). For an uplink, the receive antenna\n(a satellite antenna) is pointed toward Earth and the main\nnoise source is the Earth\u2019s emissivity (i.e. the Earth\u2019s\nbrightness temperature). Figure 14.7 shows an example of\nthe sky brightness temperature for an Earth station antenna\nat different elevation angles [10] in a \u2018clear sky\u2019 condition.\nAs can be seen, an Earth station antenna noise temperature\nis largely dependent on the elevation angle and its operating\nfrequency. For an Earth station antenna with a narrow\nbeamwidth and a higher elevation angle, the antenna pattern\nwill be largely encompassed by the atmosphere and there-\nfore the sky brightness temperature will be the same as the\nantenna noise temperature.\n\ng1\n\nT1\n\ng2\n\nT2\n\ngi\n\nTi\n\ngn\n\nTn\nTe (Te)i\n\nFig. 14.6 Noise in a cascaded network\n\n14 Communications Systems 403\n\n\n\nAs will be discussed later, rain attenuation can be sig-\nnificant at high frequency. A byproduct of rain attenuation\nis an increase of the emission noise, and therefore an\nincrease of the Earth station antenna noise temperature. The\nadditional antenna noise temperature increase from the\n\u2018clear sky\u2019 case as compared to the \u2018output\u2019 of the attenu-\nating medium at the antenna aperture can be estimated by\n\nDTa \u00bc Tm\u00f01? 10?A=10\u00de \u00f014:10\u00de\n\nwhere A is the rain attenuation in dB and Tm is the effective\ntemperature of the medium, which lies in the range\n260\u2013280 K at frequencies between 10 and 30 GHz.\n\nThe noise temperature of an Earth-pointing spacecraft\nantenna is determined by the location of the spacecraft, the\nantenna pointing direction, the antenna coverage area on\nEarth, and the operating frequency. As an illustration,\nFig. 14.8 provides the antenna noise temperature of an\nEarth coverage antenna on a geostationary spacecraft at\ndifferent orbital slots and operating frequencies. The vari-\nation of the antenna noise temperature over orbital slots for\na given frequency is due to the relative ratios of land mass\nand ocean in the field of view of the antenna.\n\nUnder certain operational conditions, part of the main\nbeam of the receive antenna could see one or more very\nbright noise sources such as the Sun (with a brightness\ntemperature around 10,000 K). In this case, the antenna\nnoise temperature can increase significantly and cause\ntemporary communications service outages. These condi-\ntions occur at the equinoxes when the Sun transits the\nposition of a geostationary satellite as seen from the Earth.\n\nFor an inter-satellite link, the receive antenna is pointed\nto another satellite and the majority of its antenna beam is\ndirected towards \u2018cold\u2019 space and will see the background\n\ncosmic noise at around 2.7 K. This usually results in a very\nlow antenna noise temperature.\n\n14.3.1.5 Transmission Media\nUnlike an inter-satellite link in which the radio signal is\ntransmitted in free space, the radio wave in an uplink or a\ndownlink propagates through the atmosphere and\n\nB\nrig\n\nht\nne\n\nss\n T\n\nem\np\n\ner\nat\n\nur\ne \n\n(K\n)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n20\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\n= 0\n\n= 5\n\n= 10\n\n= 20\n\n= 30\n\n= 60\n\n= 90\u00b0\n\n\u00b0\n\n\u00b0\n\n\u00b0\n\n\u00b0\n\n\u00b0\n\n\u00b0\n\nFig. 14.7 Brightness\ntemperature for clear air for\n7.5 g/m3 of water vapor\nconcentration for different\nEarth station antenna elevation\nangles h [10]\n\nEast West\n\nW\nei\n\ngh\nte\n\nd \nbr\n\nig\nht\n\nne\nss\n\n T\nem\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n, \nT B\n\ne\n(K\n\n)\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n220\n\n240\n\n260\n\n0 30 60 12090 150 180 120 60150 90 30 0\n\nSatellite Longitude (deg.)\n\n51 GHz\n\n46 GHz\n\n36 GHz\n\n26 GHz\n\n16 GHz\n\n6 GHz\n\n1 GHz\n\nFig. 14.8 Earth coverage antenna noise temperature as a function of\nlongitude viewed from geostationary orbit at frequencies between 1\nand 51 GHz [10]\n\n404 A. Atia and H. Yao\n\n\n\nionosphere, and therefore is subjected to propagation\nimpairments.\n\nCaused by solar radiation, the Earth\u2019s ionosphere con-\nsists of several regions of ionization in the upper atmo-\nsphere. The total electron content (TEC) accumulated along\nthe transmission path penetrating the ionosphere causes a\nrotation of the polarization (i.e. Faraday rotation) of the\npropagating radio wave, a time delay of the signal, a change\nin the apparent direction of arrival due to refraction, and\nscintillations. The ionospheric effects for a high value of\nTEC and an elevation angle of 30? one-way traversal is\ngiven in Table 14.2. The ionosphere effects above 10 GHz\nare negligible; however, the effects can be significant for\nnon-geostationary satellite services below 3 GHz.\n\nThe main effects of the non-ionized atmosphere are due\nto signal absorption by atmospheric gases (including\nhumidity) and rainfall. Attenuation by atmospheric gases is\nmainly due to oxygen and water vapor absorptions and is\ndependent mainly on frequency, elevation angle, altitude\nabove sea level, and water vapor density (absolute humid-\nity). A detailed atmospheric attenuation model can be found\nin [11]. As an illustration, Fig. 14.9 presents the attenuation\nby atmospheric gases at an elevation angle of 90? at sea\nlevel. As shown in the figure, the atmospheric attenuation is\ngenerally insignificant at frequencies below 10 GHz. Above\n10 GHz, there exist several \u2018windows\u2019 with relatively small\nattenuation and several attenuation peaks. The attenuation\npeaks of dry air and water vapor are due to interactions of\nthe electromagnetic field of the wave with the magnetic\nmoment of oxygen molecules and the polar (electric dipole)\nmolecules of water vapor, respectively.\n\nThe frequency spectrums in the \u2018windows\u2019 are selected\nfor the uplinks and downlinks of space-Earth\n\ncommunications. The frequency spectrums at the attenua-\ntion peaks, such as the 60 GHz band, are appropriate\nselections for inter-satellite links because the high atmo-\nspheric attenuation can be used as an advantage to shield the\nlink from ground originated interferences and/or jams.\n\nThe absorption due to rain becomes significant at fre-\nquencies exceeding 10 GHz, when the wavelength approa-\nches the size of raindrops, and therefore is an important\nconsideration when designing a space-Earth link for a\n\nTable 14.2 Estimated ionospheric effects for elevation angles of about 30? one-way traversal [9]\n\nEffect Frequency\ndependence\n\n0.1 GHz 0.25 GHz 0.5 GHz 1 GHz 3 GHz 10 GHz\n\nFaraday rotation 1=f 2 30 rotations 4.8 rotations 1.2 rotations 108? 12? 1.1?\n\nPropagation delay 1=f 2 25 ls 4 ls 1 ls 0.25 ls 0.028 ls 0.0025 ls\n\nRefraction 1=f 2 \\1? \\0.16? \\2.40 \\0.60 \\4.20 0 \\0.360 0\n\nVariation in the direction\nof arrival (r.m.s)\n\n1=f 2 200 3.20 480 0 120 0 1.320 0 0.120 0\n\nAbsorption (auroral and/\nor polar cap)\n\n?1=f 2 5 dB 0.8 dB 0.2 dB 0.05 dB 6 9 10-3 dB 5 9 10-4 dB\n\nAbsorption (mid-\nlatitude)\n\n1=f 2 \\1 dB \\0.16 dB \\0.04 dB \\0.01 dB \\0.001 dB \\1 9 10-4 dB\n\nDispersion 1=f 3 0.4 ps/Hz 0.026 ps/Hz 0.0032 ps/\nHz\n\n0.0004 ps/\nHz\n\n1.5 9 10-5\n\nps/Hz\n4 9 10-7 ps/\nHz\n\nScintillation See Rec.\nITU-R P.531\n\nSee Rec.\nITU-R P.531\n\nSee Rec.\nITU-R P.531\n\nSee Rec.\nITU-R P.531\n\n[20 dB\npeak-to-\npeak\n\n?10 dB\npeak-to-peak\n\n?4 dB peak-\nto-peak\n\nScintillation values observed near the geomagnetic equator during the early night-time hours (local time) at equinox under conditions of high\nsunspot number\n\nZ\nen\n\nith\n A\n\ntte\nnu\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(d\n\nB\n)\n\n10-3\n0 5 10\n\nFrequency (GHz)\n\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n100\n\n101\n\n102\n\n102\n\nTotal\n\nWater vapour\n\nDry Air\n\nFig. 14.9 Total, dry-air and water-vapor zenith attenuation from sea\nlevel with surface pressure of 1,013 hPa, surface temperature of 15 ?C,\nand surface vapor of 7.5 g/m3 [11]\n\n14 Communications Systems 405\n\n\n\nhigher frequency. Rain attenuation is also strongly depen-\ndent on elevation angle (path length in rain) and rainfall rate\ndistribution. The rainfall rate distribution varies with time\nand geographic locations. In the absence of available glo-\nbal-wide experimental data, many global rain attenuation\nprediction models have been developed based on the\navailable test results. The most commonly used models are\nthe Crane model [12, 13] and the ITU-R model [14]. As an\nexample, Fig. 14.10 shows the rain attenuation versus fre-\nquency at different elevation angles for rainfall rates that\nexceed 5\u20130.1 % of the time. The figure, generated for a\nlocation in North America based on the ITU-R model,\nclearly shows that the rain attenuation is strongly dependent\non the frequency, the elevation angle, and the time per-\ncentage for the rain rate (which is directly associated to link\navailability as shown in a later section). A byproduct of rain\nattenuation is an increase of antenna noise temperature, as\nindicated in Eq. 14.10.\n\n14.3.2 Modulation, Coding and Multiple\nAccess\n\n14.3.2.1 Modulation\nA communications link can be used to transmit voice,\nvideo, and/or data information. The information such as\nvoice and video data are baseband signals that are encoded,\nin some cases multiplexed with other signals, and modu-\nlated to superimpose them upon a high frequency carrier\nsignal that can be radiated efficiently by the antenna.\n\nModulation can take several forms including varying the\nsignal envelope, and/or phase (or frequency) in the RF for\nefficient transmission. Dependent on the signal type,\n\nmodulation can be divided into analog modulation and\ndigital modulation [15, 16]. In an analog modulation, the\nbaseband signal may be superimposed on a carrier signal to\nvary its amplitude, frequency, or phase for amplitude\nmodulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase\nmodulation (PM), respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 14.11.\n\nIn digital modulation, the baseband data with a data rate\nof Rb bits/s can be mapped into M states in amplitude and/or\nphase/frequency of the RF carrier signals to form an M-ary\nmodulation, where M \u00bc 2n and n is the number of bits rep-\nresented by each state of the modulated carrier. The group of\nbits transmitted in each of the M states is a symbol. The most\ncommon methods of digital modulation for satellite com-\nmunications are M-ary frequency shift keying (MFSK),\nM-ary phase shift keying (MPSK), and M-ary quadrature\namplitude modulation (MQAM).

Atia and H. Yao\n\n\n\nMQAM modulation called asymmetric phase-shift keying\n(APSK) was introduced in the DVB-S2 standard [6] for\nimproved performance in a nonlinear satellite transponder.\n\nAn MFSK modulator puts the frequency of the carrier\ninto one of M frequencies (separated by 1= 2TS\u00f0 \u00de, where TS\nis the duration of a symbol) according to the value of a\nmodulated voltage. The M transmitted signals are of equal\nenergy, of equal duration, and are orthogonal to each other.\nThe bandwidth efficiency of a coherent MFSK is [17, 18]\nBE \u00bc Rb=B \u00bc log2 M\u00f0 \u00de=M, which decreases with increasing\nM. Therefore, MFSK modulation is bandwidth inefficient.\nHowever, an MFSK signal is power efficient as it is a\nconstant envelope modulation (CEM) and its signal is\ninsensitive to nonlinearity in the high power amplifier in the\ntransmitter (i.e. the amplifier can be operated at saturation).\nIn addition, a CEM signal is more tolerant of random noise\nas well as Rayleigh fading. Due to this feature, FSK has\nbeen used to modulate the tele-command/control signals for\nmany satellites and spacecraft.\n\nAn MPSK modulator puts the phase of the carrier into\none of M states according to the value of a modulated\nvoltage. The modulated waveform expressed as two states\nor bi-phase PSK is called BPSK, and four states or quad-\nriphase is termed QPSK. In MPSK modulation, the symbol\nstates are equally spaced on a cycle of constant symbol\nenergy. As an illustration, Fig. 14.12a and b show the\nconstellations of QPSK and 8PSK, respectively. Obviously,\nan MPSK without pulse shaping is a constant envelope\nmodulation. However, in RF communication, pulse shaping\nis essential for making the signal fit in its frequency band.\nThe ratio of the data rate to the minimum bandwidth\nassuming ideal Nyquist filtering is BE \u00bc Rb=B \u00bc log2 M.\n\nUnlike MFSK, the bandwidth efficiency of an MPSK\nsignal increases with increasing M. However, with\nincreasing M, the constellation is more crowded, resulting\nin reduced tolerance of noise tolerance and therefore\ndecreased power efficiency.\n\nAn MQAM modulator puts the carrier vector formed by\ndifferent phase and amplitude into M states according to the\nvalue of a modulated voltage, which can be considered as\nan MPSK with variable amplitudes. Figure 14.12c shows\nthe constellation diagram of a 16QAM. The bandwidth\nefficiency of an MQAM signal is identical to MPSK. Unlike\nMPSK, the MQAM symbols are unequally spaced and do\nnot have constant symbol energy. When M is large, the\nsymbol spacing of MQAM is less crowded than MPSK, and\ntherefore an MQAM signal is less sensitive to noise and\ninterference than an MPSK modulated signal.\n\nAPSK can be considered as a super-class of quadrature\namplitude modulation. The constellation of a 16APSK is\nshown in Fig. 14.12d. The advantage over conventional\nQAM, for example 16QAM, is a lower number of possible\namplitude levels, resulting in fewer problems with nonlinear\namplifiers.\n\nThe selection of the modulation scheme for satellite\ncommunications is done according to power and bandwidth\nefficiency. The power efficiency is the ratio of the required\nbit energy (Eb) to noise spectral density (No) for a certain bit\nerror probability (Pb) of digital communication over an\nadditive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel for a given\nmodulation scheme. Bandwidth efficiency is the ability to\naccommodate data within a limited bandwidth of a channel.\n\nThe trade-off between bandwidth efficiency and power\nefficiency of different modulation schemes is depicted in\n\nQ\n\nI\n\n00\n\n0111\n\n10\n\nI = MSB & Q = LSB\nQ\n\nI\n\n000\n\n001011\n\n110\n= /4\n\n100\n\n111\n\n001010\n\nQ\n\nI\n\n1001\n\n1100\n\n0001\n\n1000\n\nR1\n\n01011101\n\n0100\n\n0000\n\n1001\n\n0011\n\n0111 1111\n\n0110 1110\n\n0010\n\n1010\n\nR2\n1011\n\n1010 1000\n\n1001\n\n1101\n\n1111 1110\n\n1100\n\n0010\n\n0000 0001\n\n0011\n\n0100\n\n0101 0111\n\n0110\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFig. 14.12 Constellation of\na QPSK; b 8PSK; c 16QAM; and\nd 16APSK\n\n14 Communications Systems 407\n\n\n\nFig. 14.13, from which it is clear that BPSK and QPSK\nhave the same power efficiency, but QPSK has twice the\nbandwidth efficiency. MFSK has better power efficiency but\npoorer bandwidth efficiency. MPSK and MQAM have the\nsame bandwidth efficiencies but MQAM has better power\nefficiency when M is greater than eight.\n\nBPSK and QPSK where the most commonly used\nmodulation schemes for satellite communications for bal-\nanced power and bandwidth efficiencies, but with the\nongoing demand of efficient use of the spectrum for high\nspeed satellite communications, including the high defini-\ntion DTH television services, 8PSK, 8QAM, 16QAM, and\n16APSK are now becoming common in commercial satel-\nlite links, benefiting from the significant progress in the\ncoding and error correction theory.\n\n14.3.2.2 Coding and Error Correction\nNoise, interference, and distortion of a digital communica-\ntions link will occasionally cause bits to be missed or\nmisinterpreted by the receiving system and therefore\nincrease the bit error rate (BER) which is defined as the\nratio of error bits to the total bits in a given time interval.\nFor given information rate and the transmission bandwidth,\na natural way to reduce BER is to increase the bit energy\n(Eb) relative to the noise/interference (No); i.e. to increase\nEb=No by increasing the transmit EIRP. However, this\napproach is not always practical, particularly for satellite\ncommunications where such factors as cost and interference\n\nplace limits on the EIRP. The preferred way is to reduce the\nthreshold of Eb=No while keeping the bandwidth efficiency\nas high as possible. This goal may be achieved by error\ncorrection. Error correction may generally be realized in\ntwo different ways:\n\u2022 Automatic repeat request (ARQ) (also referred to as\n\nbackward error correction): This is an error control\ntechnique whereby an error detection scheme is com-\nbined with requests for retransmission of erroneous data.\n\n\u2022 Forward error correction (FEC): The transmitter system\nencodes the data using an error-correcting code (ECC)\nprior to transmission. In the encoding process, redundant\nbits are added to an incoming bit stream so that errors in\ntransmission may be detected and corrected at the\nreceiver using a sophistical decoder. FEC uses no infor-\nmation feedback to the transmit side, therefore there is no\nadditional delay introduced by the error correction pro-\ncess. FEC is commonly used in satellite communications\nto overcome the effects of interference in a satellite link.\nIn an FEC process, the encoder accepts binary infor-\n\nmation at a rate of R bits/s and generates encoded binary\ndata at a rate of Rb with the coding rate of r \u00f0r\\1\u00de, where\nRb \u00bc R=r, by introducing redundant bits for error detection\nand correction.\n\nThe two main classes of FEC codes are convolutional\ncodes and block codes. Convolutional codes work on bit or\nsymbol streams of arbitrary length.

Atia and H. Yao\n\n\n\nspecified number of previous source data, so that a sliding\nsequence of past data bits is used to generate several\nencoded data bits. Viterbi decoding is mostly used for\nconvolutional codes. Block codes work on fixed-size blocks\n(packets) of bits or symbols of predetermined size. Reed-\nSolomon (R/S), codes, BCH codes (developed in 1959 by\nAlexis Hocquenghem (c. 1908\u20131990), and independently in\n1960 by Raj Chandra Bose (1901\u20131987) and Dwijendra\nKumar Ray-Chaudhuri (born 1933), the acronym BCH\ncomprises the initials of these inventors\u2019 names), Hamming\ncodes, and Golay codes, are a few examples of commonly\nused block codes. The highly efficient low-density parity-\ncheck (LDPC) codes belong to linear block codes.\n\nClassical block codes and convolutional codes may be\ncombined to form more powerful codes to provide near\nShannon-limit performance. For example, the Viterbi codes\nand the Reed-Solomon codes are combined in concatenated\ncoding schemes in DVB-S, and LDPC and BCH are com-\nbined to form new codes in DVB-S2 [6] for high-speed\nsatellite communications applications. Table 14.3 compares\nthe bandwidth and power efficiencies of several modulation\nand coding schemes. As can be seen, in comparison to an\nuncoded QPSK signal, the power efficiency of the signal\nwith QPSK modulation and ?-Viterbi coding scheme\nimproves the power efficiency by about 2.5 dB (60 %)\nwhile the bandwidth efficiency is reduced by 25 %. With\nthe LDPC/BCH codes in DVB-S2, the power efficiency can\nbe further improved by 4.8 dB without significantly\ndecreasing the bandwidth efficiency. In fact, the powerful\ncoding schemes, such as the LDCP/BCH codes and Turbo\ncodes, have made it possible for digital satellite communi-\ncations to use more bandwidth-efficient modulations with\nthe throughput for a given bandwidth close to the Shannon\nlimit as it is depicted in Fig. 14.14.\n\nTo further improve the bandwidth usage particularly in\nthe high fading link, adaptive coding and modulation\n(ACM) techniques have been proposed and adapted in\nwideband satellite communications and MSS satellite\ncommunications in order to provide very significant\nincreases in capacity [6]. ACM involves managing the\nmodulation level and coding rate for each user terminal\nbased on the instantaneous link fading condition. As the\nfading condition changes for each individual terminal, the\nmodulation level and code rate are changed in order to\nmaintain the BER requirements. As only a low percentage\nof user terminals in a service area will encounter large\nfading at any time, this technique significantly increases the\naverage information throughput per unit bandwidth.\n\nThese Eb=No performances are based on an ideal com-\nmunications channel. In reality, the nonlinearity, group\ndelay variation, gain flatness, phase noise, and interference\nexisting in the communications channel will greatly impact\nthe communications link performances.\n\n14.3.2.3 Multiplexing and Multiple Access\nAlmost all communications satellites require sharing of the\nsatellite link resource/capacity among multiple users. This\nability, allowing access to a given user by a community of\nusers through combining the respective individual signals\ninto a single one, is accomplished by multiplexing tech-\nniques, while the ability for multiple users to transmit their\nrespective data through a given satellite transponder is\nrealized by multiple access techniques. The commonly used\nmultiplexing techniques in satellite communications include\n\u2022 Frequency division multiplexing (FDM): This combines\n\nmultiple signals with non-overlapping frequency bands\ninto one wideband signal for transmission. Each signal\ncan be recovered by filtering at the corresponding user\nreceivers.\n\n\u2022 Time division multiplexing (TDM): Each signal is com-\npressed into a high speed signal and the multiple signals\nare transmitted at the same frequency but in different time\nslots. The signal is recovered at the respective receiver by\nselection of the specific time slot in which its signal was\ntransmitted.\n\n\u2022 Code division multiplexing (CDM): Each signal is\nassigned a unique signature code chosen from a set of\northogonal codes before they are combined in the fre-\nquency and time domain. The signal can be recovered by\ncross-correlating the signal with the identical signature\ncode generated by the respective receiver.\nSimilarly, the commonly used multiple access methods\n\nin satellite communications are frequency division multiple\naccess (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA),\nand code division multiple access (CDMA). In many\napplications, a combination of more than one multiplexing\ntechniques and multiple access techniques is adopted for\nmost efficient use of the satellite resources. A summary of\nvarious multiple access methods and multiplexing methods\nin satellite communications is given in Table 14.4.\n\nTable 14.3 A comparison of bandwidth and power efficiencies of\nseveral modulation and coding schemes\n\nModulation Coding Eb=No (dB)\nBER \\ 10-5\n\nBandwidth\nefficiency\n\nQPSK None 9.6 2.0\n\nQPSK Viterbi, r = ? 7.1 1.5\n\nQPSK DVB-S 5.0 1.38\n\nViterbi r = ? ?

Note that\nthe PFD is independent of frequency for a fixed transmit\nantenna gain.\n\nThe received signal level at the output of the receive\nantenna can be obtained as\n\nPR \u00bc PFD ?

These include\n\u2022 Interference generated by the same satellite due to fre-\n\nquency reuse: for frequency reuse through the orthogonal\npolarization, the interference is due to the finite cross-\npolarization isolation of the satellite antenna. The typical\ncarrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) due to cross-polarized\nco-frequency interference is about 27 dB. For frequency\nreuse through spatial diversity, such as the multi-spot\nbeams used in S-band mobile satellite services and Ka-\nband satellite services, the C/I is more complicated, being\nheavily dependent on the beam-frequency mapping\nschemes and the beam shaping. A typical aggregated C/I\nfor this case is between 14 and 20 dB.\n\n(dB)\n\n (\nbi\n\nt/s\n) \n\npe\nr \n\nun\nit \n\nsy\nm\n\nbo\nl r\n\nat\ne,\n\n \n\n0\n\n0.5 \n\n1.0 \n\n1.5 \n\n2.0 \n\n2.5 \n\n3.0 \n\n3.5 \n\n4.0 \n\n4.5 \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17-1-2-3\n\nDVB-S \n\nDVB-DSNG \n\nQPSK\n\n8PSK\n\n16APSK\n\n32APSK\n\nModulation constrained \nShannon limits\n\nFig. 14.14 Required Es=No\nversus spectrum efficiency in the\nadditive white gaussian noise\n(AWGN) channel with DVB-S2\nmodulation/coding schemes\n(ideal demodulator),\nEb=No \u00bc Es=No ? 10 log Be\u00f0 \u00de\n\n410 A.

To minimize the\nsystem impact, the inter-modulation/NPR is usually tra-\nded off with the output back-off of the high power\n\namplifier. For a satellite transmit system in a multi-carrier\noperation, the back-off is usually around 3 dB which\nyields about 15 dB NPR. For a ground transmit system,\nthe high power amplifier back-off is usually 5\u20136 dB pro-\nviding better than 20 dB C/I. The trade-off between the\nback-off and the inter-modulation interference for a typi-\ncal high power amplifier is illustrated later in Fig. 14.54.\n\nTable 14.4 A summary of multiple access and multiplexing in satellite communications\n\nMultiple access Multiplexing Advantage Disadvantage\n\nFDMA\n\nFrequency\n\nFDM \u2022 No time reference \u2022 Satellite transponder back-off required for\nlinear operation\u2022 Simple implementation\n\n\u2022 Low or medium traffic \u2022 User terminal/Modem requires multiple\nfiltering\n\n\u2022 Poor flexibility for traffic reconfiguration\n\n\u2022 May require uplink power control\n\nTDMA TDM \u2022 Small or no back-off for satellite\ntransponder\n\n\u2022 Require network synchronization\n\n\u2022 High peak EIRP requirement for all E/S\n\u2022 High traffic for large number of users \u2022 Require memory buffers\n\u2022 Easy traffic reconfiguration and demand\nassignment\n\nFDMA ?

In that case, the overall bit error rate\n\u00f0BER\u00deT of the system can be approximated from the uplink\nBER and the downlink BER [9] as\n\n\u00f0BER\u00deT \u00bc \u00f0BER\u00deU \u00fe \u00f0BER\u00deD: \u00f014:17\u00de\n\nTo meet the overall system BER requirement, the BER\nfor the uplink and the downlink have to be individually\nminimized. For the case where the Eb=No performances\nbetween the uplink and the downlink are equal, the BER of\neach link should be one-half of the system BER. However,\nwith the advanced encoding/modulation technique used in\nmodern digital satellite communications, the reduced BER\nwill have no significant impact on the required Eb=No for\nthe uplink and the downlink respectively, and they can be\nconsidered to be independent communication links.\n\nFor a bent-pipe communications satellite, the overall link\n(C/N)T is a combination of the uplink (C/N)U, the downlink\n(C/N)D, and all the interference contributions\n\nC\n\nN\n\n? ?\n\nT\n\nffi ??1\n\u00bc C\n\nN\n\n? ?\n\nUT\n\nffi ??1\n\u00fe C\n\nN\n\n? ?\n\nDT\n\nffi ??1\n\n\u00bc C\nN\n\n? ?\n\nU\n\nffi ??1\n\u00fe C\n\nI\n\n? ?\n\nU\n\nffi ??1\n\u00fe C\n\nN\n\n? ?\n\nD\n\nffi ??1\n\u00fe C\n\nI\n\n? ?\n\nD\n\nffi ??1\n:\n\n\u00f014:18\u00de\n\nBased on Eq. 14.18, an optimization of the major uplink\nand downlink parameters can be performed for the maxi-\nmum C/N of the overall link. A general illustration of link\noptimization for multi-carrier operation through a common\nhigh power amplifier is shown in Fig. 14.15. As can be\nseen, an increase in the HPA back-off will improve the\ninter-modulation interference. At the same time, it will\nreduce the usable power to the downlink carrier, and\ntherefore reduce the downlink C/N. As a result, the overall\nlink C/N reaches its maximum around 2.5 to 3 dB output\nback-off for the amplifier.\n\nIn addition to the impacts from the thermal noise and\nother sources of interference, the imperfect satellite tran-\nsponder frequency responses, group delay variations, and\nAM\u2013AM and AM\u2013PM nonlinearity of an HPA will distort\nthe transmit signals and introduce additional errors to the\ncommunications link. The major components that contrib-\nute to the impairment of a typical communication satellite\nare the channelization filters in the input multiplexers, the\nfilters in the output multiplexers, and the traveling wave\ntube amplifiers (TWTA), as illustrated in Fig. 14.16.\n\nTo minimize the impact of those components on system\nperformance, particularly in a single carrier per transponder\noperation condition as commonly used in DTH TV/data\nservices, the impacts of the input multiplexer (IMUX) filter\nmay be improved by applying proper pre-compensation\ntechniques on the modulator [19]. As an example, Table 14.5\nshows the transponder impairments and possible improve-\nment with pre-compensation techniques for a DVB-S2\nsystem at BER = 10-5. As can be seen, the quasi-constant\nenvelope modulations, such as QPSK and 8PSK, can operate\non a transponder near saturation without significant system\nperformance degradation, while 16APSK and 32APSK,\n\nInput \nMultiplexer \n\nFilter\n\nHigh Power \nAmplifier\n\nOutput \nMultiplexer \n\nFilter\n\n\u201cBent-Pipe\u201d Satellite Transponder Receiver/\nDemodulator\n\nFrequency (MHz)\n\nR\nej\n\nec\nti\n\non\n (\n\ndB\n) 0\n\n-60\n\n-30\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0 G\nro\n\nup\n D\n\nel\nay\n\n (\nns\n\n)\n\n0 20 40-20-40\n\nFrequency (MHz)\n\nR\nej\n\nec\nti\n\non\n (\n\ndB\n) 0\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n90\n\n50\n\n0 G\nro\n\nup\n D\n\nel\nay\n\n (\nns\n\n)\n\n0 20 40-20-40\n\nInput Power (dB)\n0 6-10-20\n\nOutput Power\nPhase\n\nO\nut\n\npu\nt \n\nP\nha\n\nse\n (\n\nde\ng)\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\nO\nut\n\npu\nt \n\nP\now\n\ner\n (\n\ndB\n) 0\n\n-16\n\n-8\n\nFig. 14.16 A simplified satellite\ntransponder and typical\ncharacteristics of the major\ncomponents\n\n412 A.

The impact of the inter-modulation can be\nconsidered as an AWGN interference and included directly\nin link budget computations.\n\n14.4 Communications System Architectures\n\n14.4.1 System Architectures\nfor Communications Satellites\n\nAs shown in Fig. 14.2, a bent-pipe communications payload\nconsists of an input (or receive) section and an output (or\ntransmit) section. Communications systems for bent-pipe\nsatellites are designed to provide their required functionality\nwith sufficient performance and reliability over the mission\nlife of the satellite. Typically, the overall satellite system\nreliability is specified to be greater than 0.8 after 15 years in\norbit. This reliability is apportioned between the bus sub-\nsystems and the payload. A payload reliability greater than\n90 % over a 15-year lifetime is usually specified. To\nachieve the payload reliability requirements, all failure-\nprone active components of the payload are provided with\nredundant units that can be switched in place of failed units.\nThe functions of each of the payload elements and their\nimpact on the overall performance of the system are dis-\ncussed in this section.\n\n14.4.1.1 The Input or Receive Section\nThe input or receive section consists of the receive antenna,\nthe input filter, the receivers and the input multiplexer. The\nfunctions performed by the input section elements are:\n1. Receive the uplink signals from the ground stations\n\nlocated in the receive coverage area. This function is\nperformed by the receive antenna. Depending on the\ncoverage area and polarization, the receive antenna\ncould be a global horn, a shaped reflector antenna\n(including a dual gridded reflector antenna), or a multi-\nple-feed spot beam reflector antenna. The receive\nantenna is followed by the input band pass filter that\npasses the desired receive band, while rejecting unwan-\nted potentially interfering uplink signals as well as sig-\nnals in the transmit band of the payload. This is essential\nto protect the receivers from the power that can leak\nfrom the transmit section of the payload. Typically the\ninput filter provides about 80 dB of rejection to signals\nin the transmit band of the payload, while its insertion\nloss in the receive band is on the order of 0.2 dB, thus\nminimizing the impact on the receive gain to noise\ntemperature ratio (G/T).\n\n2. Low-noise-amplify and frequency translate the received\nsignals to the downlink frequency bands. These func-\ntions are performed by the receivers. The receiver con-\nsists of a low noise amplifier followed by a down\nconverter. For each coverage area and polarization there\nis a corresponding receiver. The receivers are configured\nto have redundancy, to achieve the desired reliability\nover the design life of the satellite, and to protect against\npossible on-orbit failures (Fig. 14.17).\n\n3. Channelize the translated wideband signals into nar-\nrowband channels. This channelization is used to facil-\nitate signal routing to different downlink beams and to\nallow separate transmit amplifiers to provide the down-\nlink RF power for maximizing the DC-to-RF power\nconversion efficiency. The channelization is performed\nby the IMUX. The most common IMUX configuration is\nthe channel-dropping configuration shown in Fig. 14.18.\nIn this configuration, the wideband signal is split by a\n3 dB hybrid. One output of the hybrid is connected to a\ngroup of filters corresponding to the even numbered\nchannels, while the other output is connected to a group\nof filters corresponding to the odd numbered channels.\nThe filters are connected through circulators, which\nprovide the necessary directional isolation. Separating\nthe channels by odd and even numbers in a channel-\ndropping configuration improves the in-band channel\nperformances as compared to the case where the chan-\nnels are contiguous.\n\n4. Provide interconnectivity (switching) among the chan-\nnels. This switching is required to direct channels to the\nappropriate intended coverage on the Earth.\n\nTable 14.5 Total C/N loss from saturated un-modulated carrier with\nand without pre-compensation\n\nModulation/\ncoding\n\nWithout pre-\ncompensation\n\nWith pre-compensation\n\nQPSK,\nr \u00bc 1=2\n\n0.6 dB (OBO\n0.3 dB)\n\n0.5 dB (IBO 0 dB, OBO\n0.4 dB)\n\n8PSK,\nr \u00bc 2=3\n\n1.0 dB (OBO\n0.4 dB)\n\n0.6 dB (IBO 0 dB, OBO\n0.4 dB)\n\n16APSK,\nr \u00bc 3=4\n\n3.2 dB (OBO\n1.7 dB)\n\n1.5 dB (IBO 1 dB, OBO\n1.1 dB)\n\n32APSK,\nr \u00bc 4=5\n\n6.2 dB (OBO\n3.7 dB)\n\n2.8 dB (IBO 3.6 dB, OBO\n2 dB)\n\nOBO output back-off, IBO input back-off\n\n14 Communications Systems 413\n\n\n\n14.4.1.2 The Output or Transmit Section\nThe output or transmit section consists of transmit high\npower amplifiers including their input and output redun-\ndancy switching networks, the output multiplexer (OMUX),\nand the transmit antenna. Functions performed by the output\nsection elements are\n1. Amplify the signals in each channel (transponder) to\n\nprovide sufficient transmit power. The power amplifica-\ntion is performed by high-power amplifiers, which are\neither TWTAs or solid-state power amplifiers (SSPA).\nThe HPAs are configured to have redundancy to provide\nthe desired reliability over the design lifetime, and protect\nagainst possible failures in orbit. The most common\nconfiguration is double-ring redundancy [20]. In this\nconfiguration there are a total of M power amplifiers, of\nwhich N \\ M are active, and (M ? N) are in standby. The\nN inputs are connected by a group of switches and the M\noutputs of the amplifiers are selected by a group of\ninterconnected switches. An example that illustrates the\nconcept of ring redundancy is shown in Fig. 14.19, in\nwhich there are eight active amplifiers (N = 8) and four\n\nstandby amplifiers (M = 12). The interconnections are\nachieved by R-switches and/or T-switches. The switches\nare connected to form rings on the input, and mirror\nimages of these rings on the output. This topology allows\noperation of all eight channels with failures of any num-\nber from one to four out of the eight active amplifiers.\n\n2. Combine the amplified signals into one or more common\noutput ports to be fed to the transmit antenna. This\nfunction is performed by the output multiplexer\n(OMUX). The OMUX for an N-channel payload has N\nlow loss waveguide filters, connected to a waveguide\nmanifold, with one end shorted and the other end con-\nstituting the common port to be connected to the transmit\nantenna. Waveguide filters and manifolds are used in the\nOMUX to provide the lowest possible loss, and to\nmaximize the power handling capability. Figure 14.20\nshows an example of an 8-channel OMUX. Even so, the\noutput loss of the multiplexer is not insignificant and\ndepends on channel bandwidth, frequency band, and the\nnumber of poles (resonators) in each channel filter.\nTypical values of OMUX loss using 4-pole filters and a\n\nA A\n\nReceiver 1\n\nReceiver 2\n\nReceiver 1\n\nReceiver 2\n\nA A\n\nBB\n\nReceiver 3\n\n3 for 2 Receivers\nredundancy\n\n2 for 1 Receivers\nredundancy\n\nSwitch \n\nA A AA\n\nB BB B\n\nC C C C\n\nD DD\nD\n\nA A\n\nB BB\n\nC C C\n\nD DD\n\nA\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFig. 14.17 Receivers\nredundancy configurations\n\nHYBRID\n\nF1 F3 F5 F7 F9 F11F2F4F6F8F10F12\n\nFig. 14.18 An example of\n12-channel input multiplexer\n\n414 A.

This function is performed by the transmit\nantenna.\nMajor factors to consider in the design of the commu-\n\nnications payload are the antenna configurations, the HPA\nefficiency, reliability over the life of the satellite, and the\ntotal mass of the payload. The available payload power\nfrom the satellite platform and the payload mass that can be\nsupported by the platform and launch vehicle directly define\nthe maximum achievable communications capacity, i.e. the\nnumber of active operational transponders with the required\nEIRP. The typical communications satellite operational life\nis 15 years. Usually this life time is limited by the on-board\nfuel available to perform station-keeping maneuvers, by the\nprogressive degradation of the solar panels, and to a lesser\nextent by the life expectancy of the payload active com-\nponents. In the bent-pipe architecture, the active compo-\nnents are primarily the receivers and the HPAs. To achieve\nthe required minimum lifetime the reliability of the payload\n\nredundant (spare) units for all active components are\nemployed. Properly configured switching networks that can\nselect standby units in response to the failure of operating\nunits provide this redundancy.\n\n14.4.2 System Architectures for Telemetry,\nTracking, and Command\n\nEach spacecraft has to have a communications subsystem that\nprovides the interface between the spacecraft and the ground\ncontrol centers (or other relay satellites) for proper operation\nof the spacecraft. This subsystem is usually referred as the\ntelemetry, tracking, and command (TT&C) subsystem. For\nmost applications, this subsystem also provides the ranging\ncapability and therefore is also referred as the telemetry,\ncommands, and ranging (TC&R) subsystem. Through this\nsubsystem, the mission control center can operate the\nspacecraft and its payloads based on the mission needs via\nground commands, and receive the spacecraft housekeeping/\nhealth data as well as the mission data. Due to the criticality of\nthis subsystem for a mission, redundancy/cross strapping of\nactive flight units and near 4p (spherical) antenna coverage\nare essential to ensure a high reliability and a near-continuous\ncommunications link between the spacecraft and the ground\ncontrol center for all mission phases/modes. Figure 14.21\nshows a typical block diagram of a TT&C subsystem.\n\nThe command signal is typically a narrowband of the\norder of 1 MHz. The signal is first FSK or PSK modulated\nand then FM or PM modulated to a subcarrier. This mod-\nulation scheme is tolerant of the multipath effects intro-\nduced by the multiple command antennas and the spacecraft\nscattering due to the wide beamwidths of the command\nantennas. The redundant command receivers receive the\ncommand signal, low-noise amplify and down-convert it to\nan intermediate frequency (IF), demodulate the signal\nanalogically and then digitally to form the command data\nstream. The demodulated commands are routed to the\nspacecraft control and data handling (C&DH) subsystem\nand then properly decrypted and executed via the C&DH\nsubsystem and the flight computers. As indicated in\nFig. 14.21, the redundant command receivers are cross\nstrapped to the redundant processing units in the C&DH\nsubsystem for high system reliability.\n\nThe spacecraft housekeeping/health data (as well as the\nmission data, for many science and technology and/or\nremote sensing spacecraft), are collected, formatted,\nencrypted, and stored (if necessary) by the C&DH subsystem\nand then distributed to the redundant telemetry transmitters\nfor downlink to the control centers. The telemetry transmitter\naccepts the data from the C&DH subsystem, digitally mod-\nulates the data, and then analog modulates the signal to a\nsubcarrier together with the possible ranging signals.\n\nPrimary \n\nStand By \n\nSwitch \n\nFig. 14.19 Example of ring redundancy of traveling wave tube\namplifiers (TWTA)\n\n14 Communications Systems 415\n\n\n\nMultiple antennas are employed in the TT&C subsystem\narchitecture, as shown in Fig. 14.22, to provide near-spher-\nical composite coverage for receiving the command signals\nand for transmitting the telemetry signals, respectively.\nThese antennas include the wide coverage antennas in the\nnadir direction and zenith direction as well as the omni\nantenna with a toroidal shaped radiation pattern. The high\ngain antenna is usually used for on-station nominal operation\nfor a geosynchronous communications satellite, and for\ntransmitting high-speed telemetry/mission data for a science\nand technology satellite or a remote sensing satellite.\n\nFor some types of spacecraft, the omni antenna with a\ntoroidal shaped radiation pattern may not be required if the\nnadir and zenith wide coverage antennas are designed to\nprovide near-hemispherical coverage.\n\n14.4.3 System Architectures for Remote\nSensing and Sciences/Technology\nSatellites\n\nUnlike communications satellites, whose main function is to\nprovide communications links to convey information\nbetween two points, or among multiple points, a remote\nsensing or science/technology satellite\u2019s main function is to\ncollect information and/or images of objects of interest and\ntransmit the collected information/images to ground col-\nlection centers for further study, processing, and analysis.\nWhen the data volume is limited, the mission data can be\ntransmitted through the TT&C subsystem together with the\nspacecraft housekeeping/health data.

Yao\n\n\n\ndownlinked in real-time, a dedicated wideband downlink\nsystem will be required, as shown in Fig. 14.23.\n\n14.4.4 Key Communications System\nPerformance Analysis and Budget\n\nImportant parameters that define the communications per-\nformance include\n1. Channel bandwidth and number of operating channels.\n\nTypical channel bandwidths in C-band and Ku-band\npayloads are 36, 54, or 72 MHz. The total available\nspectrum and the selected channel bandwidth together\ndetermine the total number of operating channels. For\nexample, the available 500 MHz spectrum for each\npolarization allows for twelve channels (per polariza-\ntion) of 36 MHz each, with nominal guard bands\nbetween adjacent channels of 4 MHz. For 54 or 72 MHz\nchannels, the required guard bands are nominally 6 and\n8 MHz respectively. For Ka-band spot beam systems,\nchannel bandwidths of 125 or 250 MHz are common\nplace. The channel bandwidth selection is a balance\nbetween spectrum efficiency usage and the available RF\npower in each channel. An example of a typical fre-\nquency channelization plan of a Ku-band payload is\nshown in Fig. 14.24. The payload has twelve 36 MHz\nbandwidth vertically polarized channels and eight hori-\nzontally polarized channels (four of 72 MHz bandwidth\nand four of 40 MHz bandwidth) on the uplink. The\ndownlink has the same arrangement with orthogonal\n(horizontal) polarization.\n\n2. Receive and transmit coverage areas. Satellite coverage\nareas can be global, shaped areas, or spot beams. Global\nbeams cover the entire Earth visible from the satellite\norbital location. Global coverage allows complete con-\nnectivity among locations on the visible Earth disk from\nthe satellite position. However, a global beam allows\nonly frequency reuse by polarization isolation. In addi-\ntion, the maximum gain achievable by global beam are\nlimited to approximately 18 dB. Shaped beams coverage\nis used to maximize the gain over the desired regions,\nwhile minimizing it over adjacent regions, thereby\nenabling frequency reuse by spatial isolation. Similarly,\nspot beams are utilized to maximize the gain over very\nsmall areas, for example large cities, while minimizing\ninterference with other spot beams and allowing many\nfrequency reuses. Spot beams are more often employed\nin mobile satellite service systems and wideband Ka-\nband systems.\n\n3. Receive gain to noise temperature ratio (G/T). The\nsatellite G/T ratio is an important measure of the signal\ndegradation due to system noise. As illustrated in Sect.\n14.3.1, G/T is primarily determined by the receive\nantenna gain, the noise figure or noise temperature of the\nlow noise receiver, and the Earth-temperature background\nnoise captured by the receive satellite antenna aperture.\n\n4. Transmit equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP).\nThis is an important measure of the downlink perfor-\nmance, and is expressed in dB Watt (dBW). The EIRP is\nthe product of the transmitted power through the antenna\ntimes the transmit antenna gain as described in Sect.\n14.3.1. EIRP is the major factor that determines the user\n\nHigh Gain Antenna Coverage\n\n-Z\n\nOmni Coverage (Toroidal )\n\n\u201330\u00ba\n\n\u2013+30\u00ba\n\n-30\u00ba\n\nZenith Tx & Rx Horns\n\nNadir Tx & Rx Horns\n\n90\u00b0\n\n+Y\n\n+X\n\nPitch \nAxis\n\nRoll \nAxis\n\n+30\u00ba\n\n+Z Yaw \nAxis\n\nFig. 14.22 Typical composite\nantenna coverage requirements\nfor a TT&C subsystem\n\n14 Communications Systems 417\n\n\n\nterminal size on the ground for the reception of commu-\nnications signals, such as DTH television broadcasting\nservices.\n\n5. Saturated power flux density (SFD). This is a measure of\nthe input power density at the satellite\u2019s receive antenna\naperture that, given the transfer function of the satellite\nreceive subsystem and channelization gains and losses,\ndrives the high power downlink amplifier(s) to saturation.\nThe saturation flux density is expressed in dB W/m2.\n\n6. Overall payload gain. This is defined by the EIRP and\nthe SFD requirements.\nKey payload system performance is determined by the\n\nperformance of the individual elements that constitute the\npayload. System performance analysis is carried out by\ntracing the signal levels at the interfaces of the various\npayload components, and adding their gains or subtracting\ntheir losses in dB. To illustrate this process, consider a\ntypical example of a C-band transponder with an antenna\nbeam shaped to cover the continental U.S. (CONUS). The\nreceive antenna gain at the edge of the coverage area is\n\nassumed to be 27 dBi, and that of the transmit antenna gain\nis 28 dBi. Figure 14.25a and b show the gain/loss and signal\nlevels for the input section and output section, respectively;\nthe diagram shows the minimum and maximum levels for\nboth the primary and redundant paths.\n\n14.5 Communications Subsystem\nCharacteristics and Performances\n\n14.5.1 Antenna Subsystem\n\nAntennas are used to radiate or receive the RF signal to or\nfrom space, respectively.

Its performance is tied by fundamental\nphysics to its size, and unlike many circuit components it\ncannot be miniaturized. It is one of the most critical sub-\nsystems and often drives the spacecraft design and config-\nuration. This is particularly true for a communications\nsatellite where the antenna subsystem design must maximize\nthe G/T and minimize the power required to meet the\nsatellite EIRP. The antenna must also meet the cross-polar-\nization isolation and the sidelobe isolation requirements. The\nisolation requirements enable frequency reuse to maximize\nthe throughput of satellite communications with the limited\nspectrum available/assigned for satellite applications.\n\n14.5.1.1 Antenna Fundamentals\nAn antenna is a component for conversion of an electrical\nsignal into an electromagnetic wave or vice versa. The\nantenna radiation performance is characterized by its radi-\nation pattern as shown in Fig. 14.26. Dependent on the\n\nmovement of the electric field vector of the radiated elec-\ntromagnetic wave with time, an antenna can be linearly\npolarized if the direction of the vector of radiated electric\nfiled is constant with respect to time, or circularly polarized\nif the direction of the electric field vector rotates with\nrespect to time and maintains a constant amplitude with that\ntime rotation. The radiation pattern in its principal (desired)\npolarization is usually referred as the co-pol pattern and in\nthe orthogonal polarization is referred as cross-pol (or x-\npol) pattern. The ratio of the cross-pol pattern to the co-pol\npattern is defined as cross-pol discrimination (XPD).\n\nA fundamental parameter of an antenna performance is\nits directivity D, which measures the radiation intensity (i.e.\nradiated power/solid angle) in a specific direction and a\nparticular polarization to the average radiation intensity\nover all directions (a sphere). The directivity depends only\non the shape of the radiation pattern and can be given by\n\nD h;u\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc P h;u\u00f0 \u00de\nPaverage\n\n\u00bc P h;u\u00f0 \u00dePr\n4p\n\n\u00bc P h;u\u00f0 \u00de1\n4p\n\nR2p\n0\n\nRp\n0 P #;w\u00f0 \u00de sin#d#dw\n\n\u00f014:19\u00de\n\nwhere P h;u\u00f0 \u00de is the radiation intensity (power pattern\nfunction) of the antenna in a particular direction and\npolarization, Paverage \u00bc Pr=4p is the radiation intensity\n\nInput Circuit\n\nRx Antenna\nGain = 27 dBi\n\nReceiver Cables IMUX\nCables,\n\nRed.

For a\nlossless antenna, the antenna directivity will be equal to the\nantenna gain.\n\nThe peak directivity Dp of an aperture antenna is the\ndirectivity in the maximum radiation direction and can be\ncalculated as\n\nDp \u00bc\n4pAe\nk2\n\u00bc 4p\n\nX\n\u00f014:21\u00de\n\nwhere k is the wavelength of the radio wave, Ae is the\neffective aperture area; and X is the angular area (or solid\nangle) within which the antenna focuses the power. In\ngeneral, the effective aperture area is less than the physical\naperture area due to nonuniform field distribution over the\nantenna physical aperture. The usefulness of the effective\naperture area is in its \u2018collecting\u2019 function: for a particular\nincident power flux density (PFD), the received power is\nPR\u00f0W\u00de \u00bc PFD\u00f0W=m2\u00de ? Ae\u00f0m2\u00de.\n\nSatellite antennas generally do not try to maximize the\npeak directivity or gain. Rather, the design objective is to\nmaximize the minimum antenna directivity or gain over a\nfinite angular region (solid angle) of space, e.g. to cover a\ncountry or specific region on the Earth or oceans. So-called\nshaped beam antennas are fundamentally limited by their\nsize in the degree to which they can arbitrarily increase the\nminimum gain or directivity over a finite given angular\nregion. To concentrate all its energy into a given non-zero\nangular area of X steradians in order to achieve the\n\ncoverage directivity of 4p=X as defined in Eq. 14.21, an\ninfinitely large antenna would be needed. Therefore, 4p=X\nrepresents the maximum achievable coverage directivity for\na coverage with an angular area of X.\n\nThe coverage area of a shaped beam is usually defined\nby multiple coverage polygons, and each polygon usually\nrequires a different coverage directivity. As a useful concept\nand tool for coverage performance estimates, the maximum\nachievable directivity can be expanded to each coverage\npolygon in a beam that has multiple coverage polygons, as\nshown in Fig. 14.27. Here, polygon 0 is the main polygon\nand the maximum achievable directivity is D0, polygon 1 to\npolygon n are the congruent polygons (i.e. polygons con-\ntained within main polygon p0), polygon (n ? 1) to polygon\n(n ? m) are the non-congruent polygons, and Xi is the solid\nangle of each polygon. The maximum achievable directivity\nof each polygon is normalized to D0 as ai \u00bc Di=D0.\n\nAssuming that a hypothetical ideal antenna would pro-\nduce a constant step directivity over each polygon, the\nmaximum achievable directivity of the main polygon can be\nderived as\n\nD0 \u00bc\n4p\n\nX0 \u00fe\nPn\n\ni\u00bc1 ai ? 1\u00f0 \u00deXi \u00fe\nPn\u00fem\n\ni\u00bcn\u00fe1 aiXi\n? ? : \u00f014:22\u00de\n\nIn practical applications, the realizable directivity over\neach polygon is typically around 35\u201370 % of the ideal\ndirectivity, depending on the coverage area and its shape,\ndue to the finite antenna size, the spillover loss, and other\nfactors.\n\n14.5.1.2 Satellite Antenna Technologies\nand Implementations\n\nAntennas used for space communications can generally be\ndivided into low or medium gain antennas (gain from 0 to\n20 dBi) mainly used for TT&C applications, Earth coverage\napplications, radiation elements for phased array antennas,\nand primary feeds for reflector antennas, and high gain\nantennas (gain [20 dBi) for high data rate communications\nto a regional coverage or a spot coverage.\n\nThe commonly used low or medium gain antennas\ninclude biconical antennas, helical antennas, dipole or patch\nexcited cup antennas, and horn antennas. Figure 14.28 shows\npictures of a horn antenna and a biconical antenna, as well as\ntheir radiation patterns. A summary of low and medium gain\nantennas for small satellite applications can be found in [22].\n\nHigh gain antennas require large effective radiation\napertures, which can be provided by reflectors, arrays of\nradiating elements with low/medium gains, and/or lenses.\n\nThe reflector antenna is the most commonly used antenna\nconfiguration in satellite communications because of its\nsimplicity and light weight [23, 24]. It consists of reflector\nwith a feed or an array of feeds located in or near the focal\n\nIsotropic Level\nPr / 4\n\nP( , )\n\nPmaxMain Lobe\n\nSidelobe\n\nFig. 14.26 Antenna radiation pattern\n\n420 A. Atia and H. Yao\n\n\n\npoint. The reflector can be in an axially symmetric configu-\nration that forms a centrally fed reflector antenna, as illus-\ntrated in Fig. 14.29a. In practice, the focal length of a\nreflector antenna usually is limited, resulting in a degradation\nof cross-pol performance due to finite curvature of the\nreflector and the pattern degradation for the feeds that are not\nlocated at the focal point. To minimize the possible perfor-\nmance degradations, a dual-reflector configuration can be\nused where the main reflector is illuminated by a combination\nof a primary feed(s) and a sub-reflector using portions of a\nhyperbolic surface (Cassegrain configuration) or ellipsoidal\nsurface (Gregorian configuration). The radiation pattern of an\naxially symmetric configuration suffers from the blockage\neffect of the feed(s) and/or the sub-reflector, resulting in peak\ngain reduction and the sidelobe level increase. In addition,\naccommodation of a centrally fed reflector antenna with a\nlarge main reflector in a launch vehicle is usually found to be\nchallenging due to finite fairing dimensions.\n\nThe aperture blockage can be avoided by using either a\nsingle offset reflector configuration or a dual-offset reflector\nconfiguration, as shown in Fig. 14.29b. Compared to the\ncentrally fed reflector configurations, the offset reflector\nconfigurations can be more easily accommodated in the\nfairing of a launch vehicle since the main reflector can be\nreadily made deployable from a side of the spacecraft.\n\nTo further improve antenna cross-polarization perfor-\nmance and to allow one reflector antenna to provide multiple\ncoverage beams in different polarizations and/or different\nfrequency bands to minimize the spacecraft mass and to ease\nthe launch vehicle accommodation, polarization selective\nsurface and/or frequency selective surface (dichroic surface)\nmay be used for the main and/or the sub-reflectors.\n\nFigure 14.30 shows a dual-gridded reflector (DGR)\nantenna configuration that has been widely used in com-\nmunications satellites to improve the cross-pol performances\nof linearly polarized antennas. The antenna consists of two\n\np0\n\np2\n\npn\np3 p1\n\npn+1\npn+m\n\nFig. 14.27 Example of antenna\ncoverage definition with multiple\npolygons\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\nA\nm\n\npl\nitu\n\nde\n (\n\ndB\n)\n\n-50\n\nGain (dBic)\n\n0\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n-180\n\n-30\n\n-60\n\n-90\n\n-120\n\n-150\n0\n\n10\n\n-10\n\nPredicted Co-PoI\nMeasured Co-PoI\nPredicted X-PoI\nMeasured X-PoI\n\n-90 -60 -30 0 30 60 90\n\n(deg.)\n\n(a) (b)Fig. 14.28 a Horn antenna and\ntypical radiation pattern;\nb biconical antenna and typical\nradiation pattern.

It consists of conducting grids\nthat are parallel to the polarization direction of the signal to\nbe reflected, and a supporting shell that is constructed with\nRF transparent materials. The front reflector will reflect the\nsignal that has its vector of electric field parallel to the grid\ndirection and will allow the signal in the orthogonal polari-\nzation to penetrate the shell with minimum loss. The rear\nshell can be a solid reflecting surface or a surface with grids\nin the orthogonal direction. The signal in the orthogonal\npolarization that penetrates the front shell will be reflected by\nthe rear surface. The two surfaces can provide either con-\ngruent beams or divergent beams. Due to the filtering effect\nof the grids, the antenna cross-pol performance can be sig-\nnificantly improved ([10 dB improvement) compared to the\nconventional single-offset reflector antenna configuration.\n\nCombining polarization selective surfaces and frequency\nselective surfaces, reflector antennas can be designed to\noperate in multiple frequency bands and polarizations.\nFigure 14.31 shows an example of a reflector antenna using\na frequency selective surface that reflects Ka-band (30/\n20 GHz) signals but is transparent to Ku-band (14/12 GHz)\nsignals, as the sub-reflector of a dual-reflector configuration\nfor the Ka-band. In the Ku-band, the antenna is operated in\na single-offset configuration and the polarization selective\nsurface separates the orthogonally polarized signals.\n\nSatellites used for mobile satellite service (MSS) operate\nin the L and S-bands. These require small coverage cells on\nEarth with high satellite antenna directivity in order to\nenable multi-fold frequency reuse and the use of hand-held\n\nunits for communications. The antenna reflectors required\nfor this type of satellites are usually the unfurlable reflector\nantennas with the reflector size in 5 m to 30 m range, as\nshown in Fig. 14.32 . Unfurlable reflectors exist with flight\nheritage in frequencies from UHF to the Ka-band.\n\nIn addition to reflector antennas, lens antennas have\nfound applications in space communications. The principle\nof a lens antenna is illustrated in Fig. 14.33. Similar to a\nreflector antenna, which transforms a spherical wave from\nthe primary source to a plane wave through reflection from\na parabolic surface, a lens antenna achieves the same\ntransformation via the refraction of the lens. The advantage\nof a lens antenna over a centrally fed reflector antenna is\nthat a lens antenna completely avoids the blockage issue\nsince the primary source (feed or feeds) is located behind\nthe main radiation aperture. In comparison to offset reflector\nantennas, lens antennas are axially symmetrical and there-\nfore provide better cross-polarization performance.\n\nA lens antenna can be designed in many ways [24]. The\nlens formed by a homogeneous dielectric material provides\nwideband frequency performance, but is usually heavy.\nA waveguide lens with different zones is mass efficient but\nsuffers from narrow frequency bandwidth. A comprise is a\nBootlace (TEM) lens, which uses pick-up and radiating\nelements to receive and radiate the signals from the primary\nsource and TEM transmission lines to provide the phase\ntransformation from a spherical wave at the pick-up ele-\nments to a plane wave at the radiating elements.\n\nSince the thickness of a lens is dependent on the wave-\nlength of the operating signal, lens antennas are usually\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 14.29 Commonly used\nreflector antennas for a axially\nsymmetrical configuration and\nb offset configuration\n\n422 A. Atia and H. Yao\n\n\n\nbulky and heavy at low frequencies and are suitable only for\nsome applications above 10\u201315 GHz.\n\nA promising antenna technology for space communica-\ntions is the phased array antenna technology. In a phased\narray antenna, multiple beams can be formed and electri-\ncally/electronically steered by feeding each radiating ele-\nment of the array with a signal having certain phase and\namplitude relationships with the others. The correct phase\nand amplitude for each element are generated by a beam\nforming network (BFN) that can be implemented using\neither analog or digital techniques. When the phase/ampli-\ntude relationships of the radiating elements are controlled\nby on-board and/or ground commands, a phase array\nantenna can provide the flexibility of dynamic beam\nreforming/reshaping and/or repointing/switching to meet\nthe changes of communications traffic. It can also generate\nnulls at given directions to avoid harmful interference/\njamming signals.\n\nA phased array antenna may be formed by direct radia-\ntion elements or by a reflector/lens with an array of feeds.\nThe former has been widely used in MSS low and medium\nEarth orbits, such as the Iridium and GlobalStar satellites,\ndue to the relatively wide beamwidths required for those\norbits. Geostationary MSS satellites such as NStar C,\n\nInmarsat, and ICO G1, and wideband satellites such as the\nSpaceway satellites, have applied the latter, for which a\nlarge deployable mesh reflector (5\u201330 m) antenna with a\nfeed array is the preferred configuration in order to form\nsmall beams for high EIRP and G/T as well as to achieve a\nhigh degree of frequency reuse for high system throughput.\n\n14.5.1.3 Shaped Beam Antennas and Spot Beam\nAntennas\n\nFor a communications satellite, the coverage areas (foot-\nprints), which are usually defined by the coverage polygons,\ndetermine the addressable market and the flexibility of\nextending services. To use the satellite power in the most\nefficient way, and to obey the coordination agreements\namong satellite service providers, it is necessary to design\nthe satellite antennas such that their radiation patterns fol-\nlow the coverage footprints. The antenna which provides\nthe beam shape conforming to the coverage polygon is\nreferred to as a shaped beam antenna. Figure 14.34 illus-\ntrates a typical coverage polygon definition for CONUS and\nthe corresponding directivity contours of a shaped antenna.\nThe most successful approaches for shaped beam antennas\nto date are (a) a standard (parabolic) reflector with a mul-\ntiple feed array located in the vicinity of the focal point in\n\nz\n\nyf\n\nzf\nzf\n\nxf\nyf\n\nxf\n\nza\n\n? ?\n\nx\n\ny\n\nxa\n\nya\n\nya\n\nxa\n\nza\n\nGridded front surface\n\nRear surface\n\nFeed for \nrear surface\n\nFeed for \nfront surface\n\nFig. 14.30 A dual-gridded\nreflector antenna. Image Orbital\nsciences corporation\n\n14 Communications Systems 423\n\n\n\nconjunction with an associated beam forming network, and\n(b) a shaped surface reflector with a simple feed assembly.\nAs illustrated in Fig. 14.35, the former realizes the shaped\nbeam by combining the secondary pattern of each feed\nthrough the beam forming network, providing the required\nphase and amplitude excitations to each feed, while the\nlatter realizes the beam shaping by deforming the reflector\nsurface and thereby effectively changing the aperture field\ndistribution.\n\nFor a given reflector size, both approaches will provide\nsimilar antenna directivity performance. However, since\nusing a feed array involves a beam-forming network and\nthis can become very complicated when a large number of\nthe feed horns are used, the actual realized gain perfor-\nmance for the feed array approach will be less than the\nshaped reflector approach, due to increased ohmic losses.\nOn the other hand, when an antenna is required to provide\nmultiple shaped beams, such as the multiple cell coverage\nused by S-band MSS satellites like Thuraya and Inmarsat-4\nand the multi-coverage C-band and Ku-band satellites like\nIntelsat V [15], or to allow on-orbit reconfiguration of the\nbeam shape, the approach using a feed array can be more\nadvantageous. In addition, the shaped beam using a feed\narray approach tends to provide better sidelobe performance\nand faster roll off due to the use of \u2018whole reflector aperture\u2019\nfor shaping [25].\n\nThe shaped beam over the entire coverage area allows\nthe same signal to be delivered anywhere inside the cov-\nerage beam as shown in Fig. 14.34. However, this approach\nlimits the overall satellite throughput mainly due to the\nlimited use of available bandwidth as well as the effective\nspacecraft antenna gain (and hence EIRP and G/T) at the\nboundary. Two major approaches utilized to improve the\nbandwidth usage are to go to spot beam satellites and to use\n\nadaptive coding and modulation (ACM) techniques as dis-\ncussed in Sect. 14.3.2.\n\nSpot beam satellites allow frequency reuse for spatially\nisolated beams so that a single satellite in orbit can have a\nlarge communications throughput, which lowers the band-\nwidth costs. There can be many frequency reuse schemes for\ncontiguous spot beam configurations depending on the\nco-channel beam (i.e. beams using the same frequency)\ninterference requirement. The commonly utilized frequency\nreuse schemes are shown in Fig. 14.36 [26, 27]. The set of\ncontiguous beams that share the total available bandwidth is\nknown as a cluster. The clusters are then repeated in the\ncoverage area by relying on the fact that the beams operating\nat the same bandwidth will be separated from each other\nsufficiently to minimize their mutual interference. For a\nsatellite with N spot beams and using an M color frequency\nreuse scheme, the satellite realizes N=M\u00f0 \u00de-fold frequency\nreuse. Reflector antennas with multiple feeds providing\n\u2018single feed per beam\u2019 configuration, phased array antennas,\nor multiple beam lens antennas can all provide spot beams.\nThe multi-spot beam reflector antenna is commonly used in\nbroadband satellite systems and the phased array antenna is\nmore frequently adopted by MSS satellites.\n\nDue to frequency reuse, co-channel beam interference\ngenerated by the surrounding beams using the same fre-\nquency channel becomes critical. Figure 14.37 illustrates the\nconstruction of interference within a contiguous spot beam\nconfiguration with three color frequency reuse. The overall\nco-channel beam interference is dependent on the spatial\nseparation and the total number of the beams sharing the\nsame frequency, but is dominated by the sidelobe response of\nthe closest beams that share the same channel. The beam\nisolation requirement depends on the susceptibility of the\nmodulation to co-channel interference and the dynamic\nrange of the users. In general, the higher the number of colors\nin reuse, the lower is the co-channel beam interference.\n\nA design conflict exists between the desire for beams\nwith less spillover loss and low sidelobes to provide\nrequired beam isolation, and the desire for the beams to\ncrossover at a high pattern level to maximize the minimum\ngain within the coverage area. Reduced spillover loss and\nsidelobe levels require an aperture distribution with low\namplitude tapering that, in turn, requires directive antenna\nfeeds. However, the antenna feed size is limited by the finite\nspacing between the beams using the same channel and the\ninability to physically overlap the antenna feeds. One\napproach commonly used in multi-spot beam broadband\nsatellites to overcome the conflict is to utilize a minimum of\nthree or four reflector antennas with each providing a set of\nmultiple interleaved spot beams among the required con-\ntiguous beams as shown in Fig. 14.38 [27]. The scan dis-\ntortion can be further reduced by increasing the focal length\n(or reducing the offset) or by using the dual-reflector\n\n20 GHz\nfeed system 12 GHz\n\nvertical polarized\n\nPolarization diplexer\n\nDichroic sub-reflector\n\n12 GHz\nhorizontal polarized\n\nFig. 14.31 Dual-frequency and polarization multi beam reflector\nantenna\n\n424 A.

Figure 14.39\ndepicts the typical edge of coverage (EOC) and sidelobe\ndegradations with increasing scan angles of the defocused\nbeams for different type of multi-spot beam reflector\nantennas [28].\n\n14.5.1.4 Practical Considerations and the Impacts\non Performance\n\nIn practice, the antenna design on a spacecraft will be\nconstrained and impacted by multiple factors as summa-\nrized in Table 14.6.\n\nThe impacts of the factors in Table 14.6 on the antenna\nmain-lobe performance, i.e. the edge of coverage (EOC)\ngain, are usually small for a properly selected antenna con-\nfiguration and a well-designed antenna, and can be bounded\nby itemized antenna loss budgets as shown in Table 14.7.\nHowever, the impacts on low level co-pol and cross-pol\npatterns of an antenna can be significant, depending on the\nspecific design and the required co-pol and cross-pol levels.\nFigure 14.40 shows a typical performance impact\n\n(degradation) of the measured results with respect to the\ndesign on the low level co-pol and cross-pol for a Ku-band\nantenna in a flight configuration. A careful analysis and\nsimulation of the antenna performance in flight configuration\nwith accurate modeling techniques is necessary when low-\nlevel performance requirements become important.\n\n14.5.2 Input Filter Assembly\n\nThe function of the input filter assembly is to reject the\nunwanted uplink signals, prevent the transmit signals from\nleaking to the receiver input in order to protect the receivers\nfrom the transmit signals, and to minimize the receiver\nintermodulation products among the uplink signals. The\nassembly consists of a cascade of a low pass filter and a\nband pass filter. Since this assembly precedes the receiver, it\nmust have the lowest possible loss so that it does not\ndegrade the input noise figure significantly, and hence it is\nimplemented as a waveguide assembly. The band pass filter\nprovides the necessary rejection of the unwanted signals\n\nFig. 14.32 TerreStar Networks,\nInc.\u2019s geostationary satellite,\nTerreStar-1 launched on July 1,\n2009, aboard an Ariane 5 heavy-\nlift launch vehicle; shown at the\nlaunch facility (left).

As the waveguide band pass filter\nhas spurious pass bands at the higher frequencies, the low\npass filter is needed to provide the necessary rejections at\nthe higher spurious bands, such as the harmonics of the\ndownlink signals. Figure 14.41a shows a typical C-band\ninput filter assembly, whose schematic diagram is shown in\nFig. 14.41b. The input filter assembly must provide about\n80 dB of rejection for the transmit signals, and for signals in\nthe C-band as well as the Ku-band to protect the sensitive\nreceivers, while the pass band loss should be less than\n0.2 dB, in order to minimize the impact on the overall noise\nfigure.\n\n14.5.3 Low Noise Amplifiers and Receivers\n\nThe receiver assembly performs the functions of low noise\namplification of the uplink signals, converting the signal\nfrequency from the uplink band to the downlink band, and\nmaintains linear operation across the input drive range. The\nlow noise amplifiers are followed by a down converter. The\ndown converter is composed of a mixer, a local oscillator,\nand filters to suppress the mixing products. The receiver has\nits own DC power section that provides the necessary power\nconditioning in order to minimize impacts of temperature\nvariations on the stability of the overall receiver response.\nFigure 14.42 is a functional block diagram of the receiver,\n\nFig. 14.34 A typical coverage\ndirectivity polygon over CONUS\nand the associated shaped beam\ncontours\n\nBeam Forming \nNetwork\n\nParabolic \nSurface Parabolic \n\nSurface\n\nShaped\nSurface\n\nShaped\nBeam\n\nShaped\nBeam\n\n(a) (b)Fig. 14.35 Shaped beam\nantenna a implementation\nreflector antenna and a multiple\nfeed array; and b implementation\nwith a shaped reflector\n\n426 A.

The receiver noise figure. Typical ranges for the values\n\nof the noise figure are 1.4\u20131.6 dB for the C-band, and\n1.8\u20132.0 dB for the Ku-band.\n\n2. Gain and gain stability. Usually the receiver gain is in\nthe range of 60 dB. Gain stability over temperature\nvariations and over the lifetime is typically 1\u20132 dB. The\nreceiver gain variation over the frequency band (gain\nflatness) is required to be within 2 dB.\n\n3. Linearity. This is usually specified in terms of the carrier\nto third-order intermodulation C/I ratio when two low\nlevel equal carriers are present at the receiver input. A\n\ntypical C/I value greater than 42 dB is required when\ntwo equal carriers each at -47 dBm are present at the\nreceiver input.\n\n4. In-band spurious performance. This is the level of spu-\nrious intermodulation and harmonic signals from the LO\nthat fall within the communications band. These levels\nare usually specified to be 60\u201370 dB below the input\nsignal.\n\n5. Out-of-band spurious performance. These are the levels\nof intermodulation products that fall outside the com-\nmunications band, and are usually specified to be better\nthan -60 to -65 dB below the input signal.\n\n6. Phase noise spectral density. The LO phase noise spec-\ntral density is usually specified as a function of frequency\noffset from the LO frequency. Figure 14.43 is a typical\nspecification of the LO phase noise variation versus\nfrequency offset from the LO frequency.\n\nReuse Scheme\n(a) (b) (c)Fig. 14.36 Frequency reuse\n\nschemes for a three colors\n(channels); b four colors\n(channels); c seven colors\n(channels)\n\nFig. 14.37 Construction of co-\nchannel beam interference within\na beam lattice with three color\nfrequency reuse scheme [15]\n\n14 Communications Systems 427\n\n\n\nFigure 14.44 shows a photograph of a flight C-band\nreceiver.\n\n14.5.4 Input Multiplexers\n\nThe functions of the input multiplexer (IMUX) are\n1.

To reject spurious signals that are generated by the\nreceiver.\n\n3. To prevent the command signal from leaking through to\nthe adjacent channels.\nThe important performance parameters of the IMUX are\n\n1. Adjacent channel rejection. Each of the channel filters of\nthe IMUX must have sufficient selectivity to prevent\n\ninterference from the adjacent channels. As was dis-\ncussed in Sect. 14.4.4, the allocated frequency spectrum\nis divided into a number of channels with nominal\nbandwidths ranging from 27 to 125 MHz each. These\nchannels are separated by guard bands, which are typi-\ncally about 10 % of the channel bandwidths. The guard\nbands are required to allow practical filters to provide\nsufficient rejection of the adjacent channels. The IMUX\nchannel filters are specified to reject an adjacent chan-\nnel\u2019s frequency with at least 15\u201320 dB at their band\nedges and 40\u201345 dB at the band centers. Figure 14.45a\nshows the frequency response including the near-band\nrejection of a typical IMUX filter of 36 MHz bandwidth.\nThe required rejection specifications determine the\nnumber of filter sections (or poles) needed.\n\n2.

The\nchannel signals emerging from the input multiplexer will\nbe amplified by a nonlinear power amplifier, which\nintroduces AM/PM and AM/AM distortion. Thus, any\nsmall variations of the signal amplitude and/or phase\n(group delay) introduced by the filters will result in\ndistortion of both the amplitude and phase (group delay)\nof the signals at the output of the power amplifier. To\nminimize the variation, particularly the group delay\nvariation, group delay equalization is usually required\nfor IMUX filters, implemented either by using self-\nequalized filters or using external equalizers. Fig-\nure 14.45b depicts the insertion loss and group delay\n\nflatness within the pass band of a 36 MHz IMUX filter\nwith self-group delay equalizers.\n\n3. Temperature stability. All the performance parameters\n(rejection, insertion loss, and group delay flatness vari-\nation with frequency) must be maintained over the\nenvironmental temperature change range to which the\nIMUX will be exposed in orbit. Since the fractional\nbandwidth of the individual IMUX filters is small (of the\norder of 1 % or less), any small drift or change of the\ncenter frequency of the filter with temperature can be a\nsignificant fraction of the filter\u2019s bandwidth. For example\nat C-band, a nominal 36 MHz bandwidth filter has a\nfractional bandwidth of 1 %.

Thus, a much more temperature stable\nmaterial is needed or temperature compensation of the\nfrequency drift must be applied. Both of these techniques\nhave been employed in the design and construction of\nIMUX filters. Invar, which has a thermal coefficient of\nexpansion about 1 9 10-6/?C has been used in the past,\nbut it suffers from being heavy and difficult to machine.\nThe current state-of-the-art IMUX filters use dielectric-\nloaded resonators (DR) for their realization [29]. The\ndielectric material used in these resonators is an extre-\nmely thermally stable ceramic, has very low loss, and a\nhigh dielectric constant (36\u201380). As a result, very small\n\nsize, thermally stable, high-quality filters are realized.\nFigure 14.46 shows a 3-channel Ku-band IMUX\nassembly.

To reject other spurious out-of-band signals (e.g. inter-\nmodulation products) generated by the high power\namplifiers.\nThe important performance parameters of the OMUX are\n\n1. Low loss. Since the OMUX filters carry the high power\noutput from the power amplifiers the OMUX loss\ndirectly reduces the EIRP.\n\n2. Power handling capability. For a typical 12-channel Ku-\nband OMUX connected to twelve 125 W TWTAs each\nfilter must handle at least 125 W, and the OMUX must\nbe able to carry more than 1.5 kW of RF power. The\npower dissipation due to the filter losses will cause a\ntemperature rise in the OMUX. There must be sufficient\ncooling to limit the OMUX temperature rise. Usually the\nOMUX is mounted on heat pipes to facilitate this heat\nremoval. Related to the power handling, the OMUX\nfilters must not sustain any multipaction breakdown.\n\n3. In-band performance. The pass bands for each of the\nchannels must exhibit minimal frequency variation in\norder to minimize signal distortion.\n\n4. Temperature stability. All the performance parameters\n(rejection, insertion loss, and group delay flatness vari-\nation with frequency) must be maintained over the\nenvironmental temperature change range to which the\nOMUX will be exposed in orbit. Most output multiplexer\nfilters were manufactured using silver plated Invar alloy\nresonators that maintain a high degree of temperature\nstability and low insertion loss. At C-band, the state-of-\nthe-art is to use dielectric resonators for output multi-\nplexers to improve the temperature stability and reduce\nthe size and mass of the OMUX. In the Ku-band, tem-\nperature compensation schemes using aluminum reso-\nnators have been used to minimize temperature drift and\nto reduce mass [30, 31]. DR filters have also been\ndeveloped for Ku-band OMUX to further reduce size\nand mass.\nMost OMUX designs use a rectangular waveguide\n\nmanifold, with dual-mode circular waveguide resonator\nfilters mounted on the manifold (E-plane or H-plane) [32],\nas shown in Fig. 14.47. The filters used are 4-pole to 6-pole\nquasi-elliptic function filters. Figure 14.48 shows a typical\noverall response of a 12-channel OMUX.\n\nFig. 14.41 A typical input filter\nassembly\n\nFig. 14.42 Functional block\ndiagram of a typical receiver\n\n14 Communications Systems 431\n\n\n\n14.5.6 Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers\n\nThe functions of the TWTA are to provide amplification of\nthe RF signals with sufficient gain to achieve the required\noutput power, with the least possible signal distortion (good\nlinearity), highest possible DC to RF conversion efficiency,\nand high reliability over the design life of the satellite. The\nTWTAs can consume most of the DC power resources of a\nsatellite; hence, it is very important that they operate at the\nhighest possible efficiency. This is achieved when the TWT\nis driven to saturation. To provide the necessary drive\npower to the TWT, a channel amplifier (CAMP) is required.\nIn addition, a pre-distortion linearizer is usually used before\nthe TWT in order to improve its linearity. The complete\nassembly of the channel amplifier, linearizer, TWT, and\nelectronic power conditioner (EPC), as shown in Fig. 14.49,\nis often called an LCTWTA. The CAMP usually has two\nmodes of operation, a fixed gain mode in which the gain of\nthe CAMP is adjustable by ground command, and an\nautomatic level control (ALC) mode in which the gain is\nautomatically adjusted to maintain a constant output level\n(i.e. a constant drive level to the TWT) within a given range\nof the input signal level to the CAMP. The EPC regulates\nthe DC power from the spacecraft power bus, and generates\nthe necessary high voltages for the TWT.\n\nAs shown in Fig. 14.50, a TWT possess four major\nassemblies\n1. An electron gun that produces a high density electron\n\nbeam.\n2. A microwave slow-wave circuit that supports a traveling\n\nwave of electromagnetic energy with which the electron\nbeam can interact.\n\n3. The collector that collects the spent electron beam\nemerging from the slow-wave circuit.\n\n4. The TWT package that provides points for attachment to\nthe using system, provides cooling for power dissipated\nwithin the TWT, and includes parts of the beam focusing\nstructure.\nAmplification in a TWT is attained by causing an elec-\n\ntromagnetic RF wave to travel along a propagating structure\nin close proximity to an electron beam, as indicated in\nFig. 14.50. At the left of the diagram is an electronic gun\nassembly. The cathode, when heated, emits a continuous\nstream of electrons. These electrons are drawn through an\naperture in the anode and are then focused into a well-\ndefined cylindrical beam by a magnetic field. The beam is\nthereby caused to travel inside the slow-wave circuit for the\nlength of the tube. The electrons are finally collected and\ntheir kinetic energy is dissipated in the form of heat in the\ncollector.\n\nAt the same time that the cylindrical electron beam is\nmoving along the length of the tube axis, the RF signal to be\namplified is fed into the slow-wave structure consisting of a\ncoiled wire or a helix. The RF energy travels along the\nhelical wire at the speed of light. However, because of the\nhelical path, the energy progresses along the axial length of\nthe tube at considerably lower axial velocity, determined\nprimarily by the pitch and diameter of the helix.\n\nThe phase velocity of the RF wave (i.e. the speed at\nwhich the phase fronts of the energy appear to move along\nthe length of the tube) is made slightly slower than the\nvelocity of the electron beam. This near-synchronism\nresults in a continuous interaction between the electron\n\n-120\n\n-110\n\n-100\n\n-90\n\n-80\n\n-70\n\n-60\n\n-50\n\n1.E+01 1.E+02 1.E+03 1.E+04 1.E+05 1.E+06 1.E+07 1.E+08\n\nN\no\n\nis\ne \n\nD\nen\n\nsi\nty\n\n d\nB\n\nc/\nH\n\nz\n\nFrequency offset [Hz]\n\nFig. 14.43 LO phase noise\nspectral density versus frequency\noffset\n\nFig. 14.44 A photograph of a flight C-band receiver. Image TAS\n\n432 A. Atia and H. Yao\n\n\n\nbeam and the RF signal. Some of the electrons in the beam\nare slowed by the RF field, while others are accelerated.\n\nAs the \u2018velocity-modulated\u2019 electrons move down\nthrough the helix they form bunches. These bunches, in\nturn, overtake and interact with the slower helical RF wave,\nsurrendering kinetic energy to the wave on the helix. The\nresult is a cumulative amplification of the RF signal. A\ntypical state-of-the-art space qualified TWT has gain of\n55 dB or more, the output RF power at saturation ranges\nfrom 10 W to over 200 W, and the DC to RF efficiency at\nsaturation is close to 70 %. With an EPC efficiency around\n95 % depending on the spacecraft bus voltage, the overall\nTWTA efficiency is greater than 65 %.\n\nThe dissipated heat from the TWTA is removed by\nconduction cooling, radiation cooling, or both. Figure 14.51\nshows photographs of a radiation cooled TWTA and a\nconduction cooled TWTA.\n\nSeveral parameters of the TWTA affect the communi-\ncations system performance\n1. Intermodulation distortion. When more than one carrier\n\nis introduced at the TWT input, a mixing or intermod-\nulation (IM) process takes place. This results in\n\nintermodulation products that are displaced from the\ncarriers at multiples of the frequency difference. The\npower levels of these IM products are dependent on the\nrelative power levels of the carriers and on the linearity\nof the TWT. In the case of two balanced carriers,\nFig. 14.52 shows the variation of carrier and IM product\npower level with total drive power. The single carrier\npower curve is also plotted for comparison. The IM\ndistortion is significantly reduced in the small-signal\n(linear) region of the RF drive range. For this reason\ncommunications TWTs are often operated backed off\nbelow their saturation levels.\n\n2. Output power versus drive. The typical drive character-\nistic of a TWT is shown in Fig. 14.53. The minimum\ninput signal level for useful operation (threshold) is\ndetermined by the bandwidth and noise figure of the\ntube. The linear dynamic range is that region between\nthe threshold input level and the input at which there is a\ndeparture from small-signal or linear gain. The gain\ncontinues to decrease as the input level is increased, and\nis decreased by about 3\u20134 dB at the point of saturated\noutput power.The DC to RF efficiency of a TWTA is\nmaximum at saturation. As the drive level is backed off\nin order to improve the linearity, the efficiency decrea-\nses. To improve efficiency at higher output power levels\nwhile maintaining an acceptable linearity performance, a\npredistortion linearizer is added. The linearizer improves\nthe TWTA performance by extending the linear drive\nregion of the TWTA. Figure 14.54 shows the improved\noutput power achieved by adding a linearizer. For the\nsame C/IM value, the linearized TWTA has more output\npower (and DC to RF efficiency) than the TWTA alone.\n\n3. AM/PM Conversion. Amplitude modulation/phase\nmodulation (AM/PM conversion) is defined as the\nchange in phase angle between the input and output\nsignals as the input signal varies. This factor is measured\nstatically and is expressed as degrees of phase shift per\ndB at a specified value of power output.\n\n10 Pole IMUX Filter In Band Response\n\n-2.0\n-1.9\n-1.8\n-1.7\n-1.6\n-1.5\n-1.4\n-1.3\n-1.2\n-1.1\n-1.0\n\n-20 -16 -12 -8 -4 0 4 8 12 16 20\nf (MHz)\n\nI.L\n. d\n\nB\n\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n85\n90\n95\n100\n\nG\n.D\n\n  \n\nIns.

Image\nTESAT\n\n14 Communications Systems 433\n\n\n\nAM/PM conversion in a TWTA is caused by the\nreduction in beam velocity that occurs as the input signal\nlevel is increased and greater amounts of energy are taken\nfrom the beam and transferred to the input RF wave. At a\nlevel of 20 dB below the input required for saturation, AM/\nPM conversion is negligible. Beyond this point, AM/PM\nconversion increases sharply. A typical power output and\nrelative phase shift response is shown in Fig. 14.53 for a\nTWTA. The phase shift is relatively insensitive to drive in\nthe small-signal or linear portion of the RF output power\ncharacteristics. As the TWTA is driven towards saturation,\nthe rate of phase change increases until saturation is\napproached and then decreases as the power saturates. The\npeak AM/PM generally occurs at a drive level 3\u201310 dB\nbelow the saturation drive, and is frequency dependent. The\nvalue of AM/PM conversion is less at the low frequency\nend of the tube\u2019s pass-band than at the high-frequency end.\n\nLinearizers improve the AM/PM conversion characteristics\nof a TWTA.\n\n14.6 Satellite Communications Systems\nResearch and Development Trends\n\nDue to significant market uncertainty over the lifetime of\nthe telecommunications satellite and limited spectrum\navailable for satellite communications, it is becoming\nincreasingly important for satellite operators and/or service\nproviders to (a) utilize the assigned spectrum more effi-\nciently, and (b) build in-orbit reconfigurability and flexi-\nbility into their satellite fleets.\n\nOn the efficient use of the spectrum, most satellite\ncommunications providers have adopted digital communi-\ncations. In addition, frequency reuse based on spatial and\n\nFig. 14.47 Ku-band OMUX\nassembly integrated with\nredundancy switches. Image\nTESAT\n\nFig. 14.48 Typical frequency\nresponse of a 12-channel OMUX.\nImage TESAT\n\n434 A. Atia and H. Yao\n\n\n\npolarization diversities utilizing multiple regional and/or\nspot beams has become progressively more common for\nmodern communications satellites. These techniques toge-\nther have increased spectrum utilization efficiency many-\nfold compared with the analog communications and single\nbeams used in the early days. Spectrum efficiency can be\nfurther improved by using on-board digital regenerative\nprocessors, which recover the transmitting signals on-board\nand therefore separate the uplink noise/interference influ-\nences from the downlink ones. Iridium and Spaceway sat-\nellites are two examples that utilize multiple spot beams and\non-board digital processors.\n\nReconfigurability and flexibility are mainly focused into\nthree areas, namely (a) frequency plan flexibility which\nincludes channel bandwidth, frequency conversion and\nselectivity; (b) on-board power allocation/distribution flexi-\nbility which allows adjustment of the EIRP for given chan-\nnels and/or beams based on the business needs within the\ncapability of the satellite power subsystem; and (c) coverage\n\nflexibility which principally concerns actions on the com-\nmunications antennas. Reconfigurability and flexibility not\nonly help satellite operators to manage their fleets more\nefficiently (including opening new orbital slots, covering\nnew service areas, exploring new domains of applications in\nnew frequency bands, and developing effective/inexpensive\nin-orbit and/or on ground back-up strategy) they also help\nsatellite manufacturers to lower the nonrecurring cost and\nreduce manufacturing cycle for satellites since near identical\npayloads may be built and subsequently reconfigured either\non-ground before launch or in-orbit by ground commands.\n\n14.6.1 Frequency Plan and Channelization\nFlexibility\n\nA major development in this area is the use of wideband\nagile frequency converters.

As an appli-\ncation of this technology, a single-channel agile converter\nhas been developed and applied to the Hylas-1 satellite.\nThis equipment produces a flexible IMUX function and\npositions a fully variable bandwidth channel filter anywhere\nin the uplink or downlink frequency ranges by combining\nthe agile converter with a fixed high performance low pass\nfilter and a high pass filter, respectively. The IMUX channel\nfilter response closely replicates that of conventional pay-\nloads and can be reconfigured to different bandwidths or\ncenter frequencies by ground commands [33]. In addition,\nan IMUX with tunable channel filters in the microwave\nband is also being developed. This technology, in con-\njunction with the wideband agile frequency converters, may\nprovide a simple and more cost-effective solution for fre-\nquency plan and channelization flexibility.\n\nGreat in-orbit flexibility compatible with various fre-\nquency plans may be achieved without carrying multiple RF\noutput multiplexers by employing\n1. The technology for frequency plan and channelization\n\ndescribed above.\n2. Distributed amplification technology for combining\n\nmultiple channels into a given antenna transmit port for\ndownlink, such as multi-port power amplifiers.\n\n3. Active array antenna technology.\n\n14.6.2 Power Allocation/Distribution\nFlexibility\n\nThe key developments in this area include flexible TWTAs\nand gallium nitride solid-state power amplifiers (GaN\nSSPA).\n\n14.6.2.1 Flexible TWTAs\nFlexible TWTAs allow the saturation output power to be\ntunable within a limited range by controlling the anode\nvoltage, while keeping constant high efficiency. Based on\nthis concept, space qualified flexible TWTAs have been\ndeveloped. Typically, the state of the art for the range over\nwhich TWTAs maintain nearly constant efficiencies is up to\n3 dB. Compared to operating high power TWTAs at back-\noff, the flexible TWTA significantly reduces DC power\nconsumption at the same RF output power as illustrated in\nFig. 14.55. This feature enables an operator either to oper-\nate more transponders within the same payload power\nenvelope, or to boost the power in some transponders for\ncustomers requiring higher EIRP densities. In addition,\nfrom the satellite manufacturer\u2019s point of view, the flexible\nTWTAs also provide an opportunity for shortening the\nmanufacturing schedule by inventorying common TWTAs\nfor different RF power requirements of specific missions,\nsince TWTAs represent long-lead items because they con-\nventionally are tuned to specific frequencies and power in\nthe design/manufacturing phase.\n\n14.6.2.2 Gallium Nitride Solid-State Power\nAmplifiers\n\nGaN SSPA technology, utilizing the properties of high\npower density and high junction temperature of GaN\ndevice, has demonstrated the capability of delivering much\nhigher RF output power over a wide bandwidth with\nexcellent DC power efficiency compared to the conven-\ntional LDMOS and GaAs technologies. The reported state-\nof-the-art results from various research/development insti-\ntutes show that the saturated power in the C-band can be\nabout 100 W with a power added efficiency (PAE) higher\nthan 50 % and a linear efficiency in the Ku-band and Ka-\nband at least twice that of the corresponding GaAs SSPA.\nThe advantage of GaN technology over GaAs will become\neven more significant at higher frequencies, such as in V-\nband. In addition, GaN SSPAs can be designed to provide\nnear-constant efficiency and linearity with more than 3 dB\nRF output power variation by varying the drain voltage.\nThis property, when used together with a multi-spot beam\narray antenna, provides the flexibility of power distribution\namong the beams equivalent to the one offered by mulit-\nport amplifiers (MPAs), but without the use of a Butler\nMatrix. This obviously will significantly reduce the system\ncomplexity and the output circuit loss.\n\n0-5-10-15-20-25\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n-20\n\n-25\n\n-30\n\n-35\n\n-40\n\n-45\n\nInput Power Relative to Single \nCarrier Saturation Drive (dB)\n\nO\nu\n\ntp\nu\n\nt \nP\n\no\nw\n\ner\n R\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\nto\n S\n\nin\ng\n\nle\n C\n\nar\nri\n\ner\n S\n\nat\nu\n\nra\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\nd\n\nB\n)\n\nFig. 14.52 Typical third-order IM data for a TWT\n\n436 A.

These tech-\nnologies included those discussed below.\n\n14.6.3.1 Feed Array Reflector Antennas\nIn the existing technology, the predefined beams are\ndesigned and built into the spacecraft antenna system with a\ndifferent beam forming network corresponding to each\nbeam. The in-orbit reconfiguration is achieved by on-board\nRF switches. This technology provides only a limited\nflexibility at the price of a more complicated and heavier\nspacecraft. Many telecommunications satellites have used\nthis technology. Another means of in-orbit reconfiguration\nis to incorporate an electrically controlled low loss and high\npower phase shifter (for the transmit antenna) into each feed\n\nelement. The phase shifter is the critical component, and has\nbeen the focus of research and development.\n\n14.6.3.2 Mechanically Reconfigurable Reflector\nAntennas\n\nMechanically reconfigurable reflector antennas in general\ncan be realized either by mechanically switching in a pre-\ninstalled shaped main reflector/sub-reflector in orbit or by\nmechanically reconfiguring the surface shape of a reflector\nthat was manufactured using a material with a memory or a\ndeformable RF skin associated with small mechanical\nactuators.\n\n14.6.3.3 Reflectarray Antennas\nA reflectarray antenna combines some of the best features\nof microstrip array antenna technology and the traditional\nparabolic reflector antenna as shown in Fig. 14.56 [34, 35].\n\nP\nh\n\nas\ne \n\nS\nh\n\nif\nt \n\n(d\neg\n\n.)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nO\nu\n\ntp\nu\n\nt \nP\n\no\nw\n\ner\n R\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\n t\no\n\n S\nat\n\nu\nra\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\nd\nB\n\n)\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-40\n\nInput Power Relative  to Saturation Drive (dB)\n\nFig. 14.53 TWTA power\noutput and phase shift as a\nfunction of RF input power\n\nP\now\n\ner\n o\n\nut\npu\n\nt r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nto\n\n s\nat\n\nur\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(d\nB\n\n)\nTWTA\n\nTWTA and Linearizer\n\nC/IM\ntarget\n\nTWTA\n\nTWTA and Linearizer\n\n0 20 40 60\n\nC/IM\n\nSaturation\n\n-15 -10 -5 0\n\nPower input relative to \n    saturation (dB)\n\nFig. 14.54 Characteristics of a\nlinearized TWTA\n\n14 Communications Systems 437\n\n\n\nThe reflector with printed array elements is usually flat or\nconforming to the required shape.

However, for a communications satellite with a large\nnumber of beams, the on-board DBF will demand tech-\nnologies near or beyond today\u2019s limit of the state of the art.\nAs an attractive alternative allowing a high degree of\nsatellite coverage flexibility while maintaining feasible\nsatellite payload complexity, on-ground DBF technology\nwas introduced with the NASA TDRSS geostationary sat-\nellites and then adopted by mobile satellite service systems\nsuch as ICO, MSV, and Terrestar [37]. The on-ground beam\nforming technology requires the transfer of radiating ele-\nment signals to the ground and vice versa through a feeder\nlink and the beam forming function is realized on the\nground with all the flexibility offered by on-ground pro-\ncessing power. The available feeder link spectrum is one of\nthe limiting factors for employing the on-ground beam\nforming technology to the wideband communications\nsatellites.\n\n14.6.3.5 Summary\nAll the discussed developments provide the short and\nmedium term solutions to increase the flexibility and\nthroughput of satellite communications. In the long term,\nthe development and implementation of on-board wideband\ndigital processors, coupled with on-board digital beam\nforming networks and high efficiency flexible HPAs, will\nmake the high throughput and high flexibility satellite\ncommunications systems affordable. An outlook and eval-\nuation of the key technology for on-board wideband digital\nprocessors is depicted in Fig. 14.57 [38].\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The dotted lines show optional\nconnections and optional subsystems that may not always\nbe present. The top row contains the subsystems that per-\nform measurements and actions that either propel, change\nthe orientation, heat/cool, or power the spacecraft. The\nbottom row contains the subsystems that perform commu-\nnication with the ground facilities, i.e. telecommanding and\ntelemetry. Although the Global Positioning System (GPS)\nreceiver does not communicate with a ground station\ndirectly, it receives a ground maintained asset, time, via\nother spacecraft and its data can also be used to determine\nthe satellite\u2019s position and attitude as discussed in Chap. 12.\n\nThe data systems communicate with the other subsys-\ntems using various communication links. These links may\nbe point-to-point links, data buses or networks. The types\nand number of links used are determined by the spacecraft\nmission and the amount of data that is produced. Some\ncommunication between subsystems may use more than one\ntype of link. The power subsystem may be controlled from\nthe platform data system via a data bus but there can also be\ndirect discrete pulse commands that control critical power\ndistribution functions during emergency situations. The\nattitude and orbit control system (AOCS) sensors and\nactuators are often controlled via a data bus but very simple\nsensors and actuators are connected via individual links.\nThe propulsion subsystem, on the other hand, often consists\n\nof simple sensors and actuators and is thus almost exclu-\nsively controlled by discrete lines like valve open/close and\nvalve position status lines.\n\nThe platform data system can be almost identical for\nmany different missions. The only real difference is the\ninterface to the AOCS subsystem where various orbits and\nsatellite configurations require different sensors and actua-\ntors. The payload data system differs much more between\nmissions. For missions having a single instrument the\npayload data system may sometimes not exist at all, or be\nintegrated into the instrument. For telecom missions it is\nmainly a large data collector/command distributor managed\nby the platform data system. For advanced scientific or\nEarth observation missions it may include a complete data\nrouting function, a large mass memory, and even a dedi-\ncated payload control computer.\n\n15.1 Platform Data Systems\n\nAs mentioned, the platform data system is functionally the\nsame for most spacecraft except launchers and human\nmissions. Figure 15.2 shows the functional architecture.\nThe functional architecture is the most generic way to\ndescribe the system, since the rapid evolution of hardware\ntechnology with ever more integrated circuitry results in\ndifferent physical architectures. In the year 2000 a typical\nunit implementing a redundant data system, with discrete I/O\nfor standard interfaces, AOCS actuators and sensors and for\nthe propulsion valves and sensors, occupied 15.18 double\nEurocard size (6U) boards. By 2011 this could be done in\nabout 10 boards.\n\nThe main functions of the platform data system are\n\u2022 Telecommand reception, decoding and handling including\n\na direct ground capability of command pulse distribution.\n\u2022 Telemetry Transfer Frame generation, coding and mod-\n\nulation with an optional essential telemetry sampler for\n\nT.

The com-\nmand packets are generated on ground, embedded into var-\nious protocol layers in the ground station, uplinked via a radio\nlink and received on-board by antennas and transponders.\nThe functionality is quite well defined by international\n\nFig. 15.2 Typical platform data\nsystem functional architecture\n\nFig. 15.1 Platform and payload\ndata systems in a spacecraft\n\n442 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\nstandards. Since the 1980s the Consultative Committee for\nSpace Data Systems (CCSDS), which is a worldwide orga-\nnization, has prepared recommended standards for the space-\nto-ground communication protocols. Within the European\nCooperation for Space Standards (ECSS) similar ground-\nspace link communication standards have been written and\nthese standards are compatible with the CCSDS standards,\nthey merely narrow down the number of possible imple-\nmentations. A good overview of all the communication links\nprotocols is given in [1], while a more detailed overview of\nthe telecommand protocol is described in [2] and formally\nspecified in [3] and [4]. These standards include several\nfigures of protocol layers and protocol data elements that are\nnot repeated in this book, but the reader is recommended to\nhave them available as supplementary information. The\nprotocols are layered according to the principles established\nby the ISO open systems interconnection (OSI) model, with\nsome minor differences. The main difference is that the OSI\ndata link layer has been split into two sub-layers, the data link\nsub-layer and the channel coding and synchronization sub-\nlayer, and equipped with two additional optional sub-layers\nfor segmentation and authentication.\n\nThe channel coding and synchronization sub-layer [3]\nreceives command link transmission units (CLTU) from one\nor more RF receivers depending on the specific configura-\ntion selected for the spacecraft. A CLTU begins with the\nstart sequence, which is a pattern having good autocorre-\nlation properties. The next part of the CLTU consists of data\ncoded with a (63,56) Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem\n(BCH) code capable of correcting any single bit in the code\nword. A selection process selects which signal to use for\nfurther processing based on the quality of the start sequence\nand the quality of the code blocks. As the data is subject to\npseudo-randomization process before being uplinked in\norder to ensure a sufficient bit transition density on the\nuplink, the decoded data from the code blocks are then\nsubject to a de-randomization process before being sent to\nthe next layer in the decoding process.\n\nThe data link protocol sub-layer [4] receives telecom-\nmand transfer frames from the channel coding and syn-\nchronization sub-layer. These frames contain a 5-byte\nheader, which among various control information includes\nthe address of the spacecraft and a virtual channel identifier\n(ID), a data field and a 2-byte cyclic redundancy check\n(CRC) field for further protection of the data. As the BCH\ndecoding process may incorrectly correct code words that\nhave more than two bit errors, there is a small chance that\nerrors remain when the frame is processed. The frames are\ntherefore checked for errors using the CRC. The spacecraft\naddress is then checked and the data field routed either to an\nend user or to the next layer. If routed directly to an end\nuser, the virtual channel ID can be used to determine the\ndestination.\n\nThe optional segmentation sub-layer receives the data\nfield from the data link protocol sub-layer. If implemented\nthis sub-layer is always enabled. The data field is now\ncalled a telecommand segment and starts with a single-byte\nheader that provides information on whether the segment is\na standalone entity or a beginning, middle, or end segment\nof a larger data structure. The segment header also includes\na multiplexer access point (MAP) ID, which is used to\ndetermine the destination of the telecommand segment.\n\nThe optional authentication sub-layer receives the tele-\ncommand segments from the segmentation sub-layer and\nthe data fields from the data link protocol sub-layer. It can\noften be enabled and disabled by telecommand. The first\nstep in this sub-layer is to determine whether the com-\nmanding source is the correct one. This is done by com-\nparing parts of an appended authentication tail by a\ncalculated authentication code. This code is calculated from\nan on-board secret key also known by the ground station,\nfrom the telecommand segment data and a logical authen-\ntication channel (LAC) counter provided in the authenti-\ncation tail. If the uplinked and calculated authentication\ncodes are identical and if the uplinked LAC counter value is\nwithin an expected window, the telecommand segment (or\nthe data field) is considered authentic and can be forwarded\nto the end user by the same mechanisms as described above.\nTo prevent unauthorized access by someone recording and\nresending the same CLTU, the LAC counters are never\nreused with the same key. Keys are also replaced at regular\nintervals in case the key in use has been compromised.\n\nThe end user of a telecommand is in most cases the\nprocessing function. However, in some missions it is\nrequired to be able to perform essential telecommanding\neven if the processing function is not operating properly. In\nESA missions, this function is called the command pulse\ndistribution unit (CPDU) and allows sending a limited\n(typically 32\u201364) number of discrete pulse commands to\nswitch essential spacecraft equipment. A CPDU receives a\ntelecommand segment and extracts the embedded CCSDS\nspace packet [5] that contains a list of one or more pulse\ncommands to be generated.\n\nThe end user receives whatever data is embedded inside\nthe telecommand segment. This typically is one or more\nCCSDS space packets, but it may also be an internet pro-\ntocol (IP) datagram or other packet structure that can be\nuniquely identified by the first three or four bits that often\ndetermine the structure of the data received. The CCSDS\nstandards define a specific encapsulation service [6] for\nthose data structures that cannot be uniquely identified by\nthe end user.\n\nThe various layers in the protocol stack allow imple-\nmentation of a communications operation procedure (COP)\nbetween the ground station and the spacecraft [7]. A COP\ncan be used to ensure that commands are always received\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 443\n\n\n\nand accepted on-board a spacecraft in the same order as\nthey are generated. This is done by using sequence counters\nin the telecommand transfer frame header, by only accept-\ning transfer frames that arrive in sequence, and by down-\nlinking in telemetry the next expected value of the sequence\ncounter to detect whether a frame has been lost. For deep\nspace missions a different protocol that does not guarantee\nthe command order is often used because the communica-\ntion delays do not allow receiving telemetry information\nabout lost frames in due time.\n\nWhen the telecommand function is made redundant, it is\nalmost always operated in hot redundancy. The virtual\nchannel ID is typically used by the ground operator to\nproperly address the two telecommand functions. For\nimplementations without the segmentation sub-layer, dif-\nferent sets of virtual channel IDs can be assigned to the two\ntelecommand functions.\n\nThe implementations of the telecommand function are\noften governed by local end customer requirements. For\ninstance, in ESA spacecraft that follow the ECSS standards,\nit is mandatory that the telecommand function as described\nin this section is completely implemented in hardware\nwithout involving any software. Other spacecraft implement\nthe data link layer and upper layers completely in software,\nas is described later in this book. These spacecraft may have\na device called a hardware command decoder that handles a\nlimited set of command functions completely in hardware.\n\n15.1.2 Telemetry\n\nThe spacecraft telemetry function is, like the telecommand\nfunction, quite well defined by international standards. The\nCCSDS and ECSS standards once again specify more\ndetails than can be described in this book. A detailed\noverview of the telemetry protocol is described in [8] and\nformally specified in [9] and [10]. As for the telecommand\nprotocol, a layered structure with a data link sub-layer and a\nchannel synchronization and coding sub-layer is used.\n\nThe data link sub-layer typically receives CCSDS space\npackets from a producer on-board the spacecraft. As for the\ntelecommand protocol, any data structure is accepted since\n\nthe data link sub-layer does not make use of any data inside\nthe data block to be transferred. The data producers are\nmainly the on-board computer application software, which\ngenerates real-time data, and the on-board mass memory,\nwhich stores packets during periods of ground station non-\nvisibility. Each source of data is allocated one or more\nvirtual channels on the downlink and for each virtual\nchannel there is an assembly mechanism that sequentially\npacks the received data into fixed-length telemetry transfer\nframes as illustrated in Fig. 15.3. The structure of the frame\nis similar to that of the telecommand transfer frame. It starts\nwith a 6-byte header followed by the user data stream. The\ntelemetry transfer frame may end with a field called a\ncommand link control word (CLCW), which is used as\nreporting mechanism in a telecommand COP, followed by\nan optional 2-byte CRC for error detection purposes.\n\nThe assembly mechanisms sequentially number the\ngenerated frames using one numbering sequence for each\nvirtual channel and temporarily stores them in a small buffer\nmemory. The next step in the process is to select which\nframes to transmit. The most common principle used is a\nbandwidth allocation method that guarantees to each virtual\nchannel a minimum available bandwidth. This bandwidth is\nautomatically increased when other virtual channels do not\nfully use their minimum allocated bandwidth. Other prin-\nciples may use priority for specific virtual channels. If there\nis no virtual channel ready to send data, the virtual channel\nmultiplexer will start generating an idle transfer frame\nbecause the telemetry downlink relies on a continuous flow\nof equally sized telemetry transfer frames in order to keep\nthe ground station reception process locked to the data\nstream.\n\nThe virtual channel multiplexer adds some information\nto the telemetry transfer frame header. The most important\nparts are the spacecraft ID and an overall frame count that is\ncommon for all frames irrespective of their virtual channel.\n\nThe channel coding and synchronization sub-layer\nreceives the telemetry transfer frames from the data link\nsub-layer. To protect the data when being transferred on a\nnoisy downlink the frames can be protected by an optional\nerror-correcting code. Two main coding mechanisms are\ndefined in the standards. The first code uses a non-binary\n\nFig. 15.3 Assembly of\ntelemetry transfer frames\n\n444 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\nblock code, a Reed-Solomon RS(255,223) code, that allows\nthe correction of up to a maximum of 16 wrong bytes for\neach 255-byte block in the frame. The second code, a pat-\nented forward error correction code called Turbo code, give\neven better performance than the RS code but at the expense\nof a more complicated implementation.\n\nAfter the coding process the frames, which are now\nconverted to long code words, can be subject to an optional\npseudo-randomization process in order to generate a suffi-\ncient bit transition density on the downlink. The next step is\nto prefix the frame with a 32-bit attached sync marker\n(ASM). Finally, if no coding or RS coding has been selected\nin the earlier stages, a final optional coding step called\nconvolutional encoding can take place. This is a relatively\npowerful coding mechanism, especially in combination\nwith the RS coding, that is very simple to implement on-\nboard. It has been used for a very long time in space\ntelemetry communication links.\n\nThe data structure now generated, starting with the ASM,\nis called a channel access data unit (CADU). These are\ncontinuously sent to the spacecraft downlink RF transmitter\nat a bit transmission rate that is determined by the available\nlink bandwidth. The maximum available link bandwidth\nvaries and depends on factors like the distance between\nthe spacecraft and the ground antenna, the gains of the\nspacecraft and ground antennas, the elevation of the ground\nantenna, and the desired maximum error rate desired for\nthe link. The application software can keep track of when it\nis possible to automatically change the bit rate, or the\ncommand to change this can come from the ground\noperator.\n\nThe receiving ground station continuously looks for the\n32-bit ASM pattern. If two such patterns are found sepa-\nrated by exactly the number of bits that form the telemetry\ntransfer frame (or the code word if coding is used) the\nground station considers itself locked to the telemetry data\nstream and can start the decoding and user data extraction\nprocess needed before the on-board generated packets can\nreach their final destination on ground.\n\nThe telemetry function is, with very few exceptions,\noperated in cold redundancy and may also not be operated\nat all in order to save power during periods of no ground\ncontact. The redundancy management is in most cases done\nby the ground operator, based on the quality of the received\ntelemetry data. However, if users find that they cannot send\ntheir data to the telemetry function they may request an\nautomatic on-board redundancy switchover. This switc-\nhover is then typically managed by an application software\nFDIR task.\n\nThe optional essential telemetry function is required to\noperate in the same way as the CPDU and hardware com-\nmand decoder, i.e. to collect TM data and generate TM\npackets without involving the main application software.\n\nThe main reason is to avoid blind commanding in the event\nof software problems in order that the end result of all\ncommands that use only hardware mechanisms can also be\nobserved by hardware only.\n\n15.1.3 Processing\n\nThe processing function is responsible for executing the\napplication software of the spacecraft platform. The defi-\nnition of what to include in the processing function varies\nbut in addition to the pure computer hardware, it is quite\ncommon to include the hardware drivers and sometimes the\noperating system in the processing function, although this\nwill also be discussed in Chap. 16.\n\nThe processing function is the key element in modern\ndata systems as more and more tasks are implemented in the\napplication software and as the communication protocols\nnormally handled by software, basically the ones above the\ndata link layer, are becoming more and more complex.\n\nThe functionality provided by the processing is rather\nstraightforward\n\u2022 General processing capability, often from a general pur-\n\npose processor and rarely from a specialized processor\nlike a digital signal processor (DSP).\n\n\u2022 Storage capability, both volatile and non-volatile, for\napplication software code and data.\n\n\u2022 A booting mechanism that loads the application software\nwhenever the processing function is powered or reset.\nDuring the boot process it is often possible to run an\noptional self-test of the processing function.\n\n\u2022 An application program interface (API) allowing the\napplication software to communicate with the data sys-\ntem hardware.\n\n\u2022 Scheduling mechanisms and event handling mechanisms\nallowing the application software to handle synchronous\nand asynchronous events.\n\n\u2022 Timers to generate various events.\n\u2022 Error detection mechanisms reporting hardware and\n\nsoftware malfunctions.\n\u2022 Error correction mechanisms that maintain correct\n\nmemory content even in the event of transient errors.\n\u2022 Development and debugging support allowing the appli-\n\ncation software developer to test and validate the soft-\nware in its final environment.\nIn most spacecraft applications, the processing function\n\nis operated in cold redundancy. The main reasons for doing\nso are power consumption and reliability. An unpowered\ncomputer consumes almost no power and, as a rule of\nthumb, its failure rate is considered to be 10 % of the failure\nrate when powered. If the nominal processing function fails,\nthe redundant one can take over within 5\u201320 s depending on\nwhether a self-test is performed or not.\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 445\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_16\n\n\nIn some missions, the processing function is required to\nbe operated in warm redundancy. This means that the\nredundant processing function is powered and executing\nsome application software, and is ready to take over if the\nnominal processing function fails. The switch-over process\nis in this case much faster, of the order of 0.1\u20131 s. This\nmode can be required for interplanetary missions where for\ninstance the planetary orbit insertion maneuvers are con-\nsidered critical.\n\nThe processing functions can also be operated in hot\nredundancy, with both controlling the spacecraft by parallel\nreading of sensors and parallel commanding of actuators.\nThis type of configuration is rarely used, as it doubles the\nprobability of generating erroneous commands and compli-\ncates the selection of which command to use by an actuator.\n\n15.1.4 On-Board Communications Links\n\nThe data system must communicate with other systems on-\nboard the spacecraft. This can be done either by a central-\nized concept using dedicated communications links for each\nsubsystem, or by using a bus or a network. The main\nprinciples for the three different concepts are shown in\nFigs. 15.4, 15.5 and 15.6.\n\nThe communications topologies have different properties\nand, depending on the needs, one may be more suitable for a\nspecific application than the others. Table 15.1 shows a list\nof pros and cons. In most spacecraft to date, a bused concept\nhas been selected since it provides a scalable and flexible\ninterface for different spacecraft platforms. The bused\nconcept also encourages reuse of standardized equipment\nbetween applications.\n\nFor future applications where higher overall data rates\nare expected, the bused topology will have a limitation. The\ndata buses in use today have a transmission capability of\nless than 1 Mbps, and to increase the capacity more buses\nmust be added. By going to a networked topology, trans-\nmission rates of tens or even hundreds of Mbps are possible.\n\nTo determine which link/bus/network to use a number of\nfactors must be considered, primarily\n\u2022 What types of data are to be transmitted? Single byte/\n\nword values or larger blocks of data?\n\u2022 Which peak data rates and communication latencies are\n\nrequired?\n\u2022 How many nodes are to be connected?\n\u2022 Which inter-node communications paths are needed?\n\u2022 Are there requirements for deterministic communications?\n\u2022 Electrical aspects such as galvanic isolation, EMC and\n\nnoise tolerance, power consumption and availability of\nspace qualified interface circuits.\nA more detailed description of some buses and networks\n\nin use today is found in Sect. 15.5.\n\n15.1.5 Sensor Data Collection and Actuator\nCommanding\n\nThe application software must have access to on-board\nsensors and actuators in order to perform its control tasks\nand to be able to monitor the status of the spacecraft. Most\nsensors and actuators can be classified as belonging to one\nof two types\n(A) \u2018Non-intelligent\u2019 simple devices that merely include\n\nthe pure sensing/activating function. Examples of these\ndevices are thermistors, contacts, motors, magnetor-\nquers, and propulsion valves.\n\n(B) \u2018Intelligent\u2019 sensors that also include some kind of\ndigital data processing.\n\nType A devices are typically connected to the data sys-\ntem via separate cables for each sensor/actuator and the\nconversion between analog and digital signals takes place\ninside the data system using a dedicated discrete I/O\ninterface function. This function is called for instance\nremote terminal unit (RTU) or remote interface unit (RIU)\nwhen implemented in hardware. Type B devices include the\nanalog/digital converter and are in many cases connected to\nthe platform communication bus/network. It is expected that\nin the future there will be sensors that provide interfaces to\nso called \u2018sensor buses\u2019. These buses are simple links\nintended for low rate and short range communications\nbetween an RTU/RIU and a limited number of small sen-\nsors. Some corresponding commercial links are I2C, 1-Wire\nand LIN but so far there is no available standard for space\napplications, although work has been initiated with expec-\nted results within the ECSS system.\n\nFor type A devices there are numerous interfacing pos-\nsibilities. An effort to standardize interfaces for relays, opto-\ncouplers, contacts, and thermistors has been done in for\ninstance [11]. For other elements such as heaters, valves,\nmotors, and magnetorquers there are no formal standards\nand each actuator manufacturer determines the interface\ncharacteristics. A de facto standard for actuators which need\nsignificant power has, however, emerged based on the most\ncommon primary power voltages available, 28 and 50 V.\n\nFig. 15.4 Centralized communications concept\n\n446 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\n15.1.6 On-Board Time Keeping\n\nThe on-board time (OBT) function is responsible for\nmaintaining the local spacecraft time. This can either be\nfree-running or synchronized to a global atomic reference\ntime like TAI; see Sect. 4.1.6.\n\nA free-running OBT is typically used in launchers and\nother vehicles where the absolute value of time is not\nimportant. Even if the OBT is free-running, it is possible to\ndetermine the drift of the spacecraft clock relative to the\nUTC by for instance time-stamping specific telemetry\nframes, both when they are sent from the spacecraft and\nwhen they are received at the ground station. The time\nstamping on-board uses the OBT and this value is then\ntransmitted as a data packet to the ground station within a\nfew seconds after the event. By comparing the two time\nvalues and by knowing the distance from the ground station\nto the spacecraft, the OBT value can be determined with an\naccuracy of about 1 ls. The method is described in more\ndetail in [12].\n\nHaving determined the absolute error of the OBT, it is\npossible for the ground operator to synchronize the OBT by\nsending up telecommands that adjust the OBT value for-\nwards or backwards. The adjustment can be done instanta-\nneously, but it will have the effect that some OBT time\nvalues will be missing (in case of advancing the OBT) or\nwill be duplicated (in case of rewinding the OBT). Having\n\nmissing or duplicated time values may upset some on-board\nfunctions that depend on preprogrammed time values for\ntheir execution. A better solution is to speed up or slow\ndown the OBT clock. If the clock frequency is increased by\nsay 1 % it will take 100 s to advance the clock 1 s and\nduring this process there are no time values missing.\n\nFor LEO missions it is quite common to have a GPS\nreceiver on-board. A GPS receiver generates a 1 Hz refer-\nence clock with an extremely good long-term stability, and\ncan be used to keep the OBT synchronized with the TAI. If\nthe GPS signal is lost, the OBT will continue to run on its\nfree-running clock and can be re-synchronized when the\nGPS signal reappears.\n\nFor a free-running OBT there are in principle three\nclasses of clock stability depending on the type of oscillator\nthat is used\n\u2022 For a standard crystal oscillator (XO) the OBT clock\n\nfrequency will be within \u00b150 to \u00b1100 parts per million\n(ppm) of its ideal value.\n\n\u2022 For a temperature compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO)\nthe OBT clock frequency will be within a few ppm of its\nideal value.\n\n\u2022 For an oven controlled crystal oscillator (OCXO) the\nOBT clock frequency will be within some tens of ppb\n(parts per billion) of its ideal value.\nAn XO has three main parameters. The first parameter is\n\nthe initial setting error, which is typically a few ppm. The\n\nFig. 15.5 Bused\ncommunications concept\n\nFig. 15.6 Network\ncommunications concept\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 447\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nsecond parameter is the temperature drift, which is a\nphysical effect that depends on how the crystal is manu-\nfactured and is typically \u00b120 to \u00b130 ppm over the tem-\nperature range of -30 to +70 ?C that is required for many\nspacecraft electronic units. The third parameter is the aging\neffect. This effect is most noticeable in the first weeks of\noperation, and decays with time. Typical values\nare \\1 ppm/month for the first few months and \\1 ppm/\nyear after the first year.\n\nThe format of the OBT time code is also controlled by an\ninternational standard [13]. One commonly used format is\nthe CCSDS unsegmented time code (CUC). It is a simple\nbinary counter with the most significant part counting sec-\nonds and the least significant part counting fractions of a\nsecond. The maximum size defined is 32 bits of seconds\nand 24 bits of fractions. This gives a resolution of 60 ns and\na wrap-around time of 136 years. The zero value of the\nOBT (also called the Epoch) can represent one of three\ncommonly used moments in time\n\u2022 The start of the mission. A common used name for this\n\ntype of counting is mission elapsed time (MET).\n\u2022 1st January 1958, which is the date when the international\n\natomic time (TAI) was synchronized with the universal\ntime (UT).\n\n\u2022 1st January 2000; from the modified Julian date (MJD)\nintroduced in Sect. 4.1.6.\n\n15.1.7 Data Storage\n\nThe platform data system often has a data storage capability\nthat is used to store platform telemetry data when there is no\nground contact. This memory can also be used to store\noperational data like the mission timeline and on-board\ncontrol procedures, and sometimes different application\nsoftware images or configuration data, both for the data\nsystem processor and for processors in the payload.\n\nThe size of the platform data storage is typically in the\nrange from a few Gbit up to about 32 Gbit. The latter limit\nis the addressing limit when using 32 bit addresses and also\nmatches quite well what is needed when operating with the\ntelemetry data rates in the order of a few Mbps normally\nprovided by the platform data system. For a 1 Mbps\ndownlink rate, a 32 Gbit memory will be downlinked in\nabout 9 h. Thus, it is suitable for missions that do not\ngenerate data at high rates, such as interplanetary missions,\nwhere both the distance and the ground station coverage put\na limit on how much data that can be downlinked.\n\nThere are three common ways to organize the data\nstorage. The first way is to operate it like a classical hard\ndisk with files and directories. Files can be dynamically\ncreated, deleted, opened, and closed, and they can grow and\nshrink dynamically. This mode is often combined with a file\ntransfer protocol on top of the telecommand and telemetry\nprotocols described earlier [14].\n\nThe second data storage method is to operate the data\nstorage with a classical circular buffer concept. One or more\ncircular buffers are created, and data can be written into a\nbuffer and read from the same buffer in parallel. If ever the\nwriting process is faster and the buffer is filled, there are two\npossibilities; either the writing process is halted until there\nis enough space available (a classical first-in first-out buffer,\nFIFO) or the oldest data is discarded and overwritten\nwithout ever being read. The method to use depends on the\ntype of data stored and whether the data producer has\nadditional buffering capability. A ground operations con-\ncept for circular buffers is described in [12] where the\nbuffers are called packet stores.\n\nThe third data storage method is to use the data storage\nas a simple linear memory with no extra features.\n\nThe file storage concept can be used for both telemetry\ndata and operational data. The circular buffer concept is\nonly used for telemetry data, and the linear memory is\nmainly used for operational data.\n\nTable 15.1 Comparison between different communications topologies\n\nArchitecture Pros Cons\n\nCentralized \u2022 Simple\n\u2022 Low cost in small systems\n\u2022 High data rates possible\n\u2022 Easy to integrate and test\n\n\u2022 Difficult to expand\n\u2022 Large systems become complex\n\u2022 Often many different types of interfaces\n\u2022 Difficult to monitor all traffic\n\nBused \u2022 Modular and scalable to different requirements\n\u2022 Standardized interface to all units and subsystems\nFairly easy to integrate and test\n\u2022 Easy to monitor all traffic\n\n\u2022 Complex for small systems unless the bus I/F is simple\n\u2022 It may be difficult to isolate a faulty device jamming the bus\ncommunication\n\u2022 Limited data rates\n\nNetworked \u2022 Same as for the bused system (except the traffic\nmonitoring)\n\u2022 High data rates possible\n\u2022 Distributed fault tolerance\n\n\u2022 Complex for small systems unless the network I/F is simple\n\u2022 Difficult to monitor all traffic\n\u2022 A faulty device could block other communication\n\n448 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\n15.2 Fault Detection, Isolation\nand Recovery, and Autonomy\nSupport\n\nOne of the most important features of an autonomous vehicle\nis its capability of continued operation or safe operation after\nfaults occur. In a spacecraft it is the task of the data system,\nin combination with the application software, to ensure that\nall spacecraft subsystems are sufficiently operational to meet\nthe overall autonomy objectives. As the application software\nplays a major role in monitoring and controlling other sub-\nsystems, the main task of the data system is to keep the\napplication software running. The mechanisms that perform\nthis task are grouped into a common functionality called\nfault detection, isolation and recovery (FDIR).\n\n15.2.1 General Dependability Terms\n\nThe definition of a fault tolerant system is generally not\nvery exact, and can vary from application to application.\nThere are however some commonly agreed key terms that\nare helpful in describing a fault tolerant system. A definition\nof the terms related to dependable systems can be found in\n[15] and is briefly summarized in this section.\n\u2022 A system failure occurs when the delivered service of a\n\nsystem deviates from the specified service, where the\nspecification is normally a combination of the required\nservice and a description of the provided service (com-\npare e.g. the supplementary information contained in a\nrequirements specification and the corresponding user\nmanual).\n\n\u2022 The failure occurred because the system was erroneous,\ni.e. it contains an error. An error is typically a part of the\nsystem state that leads to the system failure. An error\nneed not lead to a failure; it can be corrected by for\ninstance some kind of error correcting code or another\nredundancy mechanism.\n\n\u2022 The cause of an error is called a fault. A fault need not\ndirectly lead to an error; the error can be latent until it is\nactivated. Faults are typically classified as physical faults\nand human-made faults, where the last class includes\ndesign faults and operating faults.\nA dependable computer system is typically defined as a\n\nsystem that reliably delivers its services in the presence of\nfaults and errors. Examples of dependability terminology\nare reliability, availability, maintainability, and safety,\nwhich essentially are explicit measures of dependability.\nMeasures are not very useful if there are no means by which\n\nto improve a system that has unacceptable measures. To\nachieve a dependable system, the set of means are\n\n\u2022 Fault-avoidance\u2014how to prevent, by design, the occur-\nrence of a fault.\n\n\u2022 Fault-tolerance\u2014how to provide, by redundancy, the\nspecified service in spite of faults occurring.\n\n\u2022 Fault-removal\u2014how to remove the presence of design\nfaults.\n\n\u2022 Fault-forecasting\u2014how to estimate, by evaluation, the\npresence, creation and consequences of errors.\n\nThe remaining text in this section describes the mecha-\nnisms used to implement the fault-tolerance functionality.\n\n15.2.2 Fault Detection and Isolation\nMechanisms\n\nAs mentioned above the first step in the process of keeping\nthe application software running is to detect faults that\noccur in the processing function. Since faults are detected as\nerrors, the common term used is error detection. Some of\nthe error detection mechanisms used by current imple-\nmentations are\n\n\u2022 Access to protected or unimplemented areas.\n\u2022 Bus time out when accessing I/O devices.\n\u2022 Error correcting codes in memory that detect correctable\n\nand uncorrectable error.\n\u2022 Cyclic redundancy check and/or check summing of vital\n\nmemory areas.\n\u2022 Voting on multiple copies of vital memory data.\n\u2022 Parity on address, data and control buses.\n\u2022 Watchdog.\n\u2022 Processor under-voltage detector.\n\u2022 Built-in self-tests.\n\nWhen errors are detected they can sometimes be miti-\ngated immediately, as is the case of reading data from a\nmemory that is protected by an error detection and correc-\ntion (EDAC) device. An EDAC that detects a correctable\nerror can still forward correct data to the processor. Note\nhowever that this does not mean that the fault in the\nmemory is corrected. By reading the same address again the\nerror will repeat.\n\nIf errors cannot be immediately corrected then some kind\nof alarm must be raised to signal that proper operation can\nno longer be provided. It is sometimes necessary to tem-\nporarily block the output from the processing function when\nan error occurs to prevent the error from producing\nunwanted output from the system.\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 449\n\n\n\n15.2.3 Correction Mechanisms\n\nThe data system uses three main mechanisms to correct an\nerror.\n\nMemory scrubbing: The correctable errors in memory\noften result from a single-event upset (SEU). These are\ntransient faults caused by a charged particle, a proton or a\nheavy ion, changing the value of one or more adjacent bits\nin a memory chip; see Sect. 3.3.2 for further information.\nMost EDACs have the capability to correct the effect of one\nSEU, but if nothing is done SEUs will accumulate in the\nmemory and may result in uncorrectable errors. The solu-\ntion is to continuously read the entire memory and, when a\ncorrectable error is detected, to rewrite the memory with\ncorrect data to remove the transient fault. This process is\ncalled memory scrubbing and can be done either by soft-\nware or by a hardware mechanism.\n\nReconfiguration module (RM)\u2014An RM is a function that\nlistens to the various alarms generated by the processing\nfunction and then decides what action to take based on the\nnature of the alarm. A watchdog alarm is probably caused\nby malfunctioning application software and the first action\nin this case could be to simply reset the processing function.\nIf this action is not successful, there is most likely a hard-\nware fault somewhere and the next action would be to\nperform a switch-over to the redundant processing function.\nOther alarms, like under-voltage alarms or address parity\nerror, are directly classified as generated by hardware and\nthe first action is to directly perform a switch-over to the\nredundant processing function. The RM does not always\nrely only on alarms coming from the processing function.\nAs errors cannot be detected with 100 % probability, there\nmay be errors that result in no alarms but can cause\nincorrect behavior of the data system resulting, for instance,\nin loss of the attitude control function. A common method\nto detect even these possibilities is to have alarms originate\nfrom independent sources in various spacecraft subsystems.\nThese alarms typically are\n\u2022 Attitude anomaly\n\u2022 Battery under-voltage\n\u2022 Thermal limit reached.\n\nIn having these system alarms, it is considered that\n100 % of the data system errors are detected, and the reli-\nability modeling can be simplified since there are no single\nfaults that can cause a system failure.\n\nSafeguard memory (SGM)\u2014When the RM has performed\na processor reset or a processor switch-over, the application\nsoftware that has started must be provided with some\nknowledge of the system status prior to the error. The\nmechanism used here is called safeguard memory, which is a\nmemory that keeps its content during a processor reset or\nreconfiguration. During normal operation, the application\n\nsoftware regularly saves context data in the SGM and this\ndata can then be retrieved by the software following a restart.\nTypical data that is saved are control loop state variables,\nactuator and sensor health status, and, of course, internal data\nsystem configuration parameters. The SGM is normally a\nvolatile memory several hundred kilobytes in size that is\npermanently powered, but if the spacecraft can lose its pri-\nmary power then some parts of the SGM can be implemented\nusing non-volatile memory technology like electrically\nerasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) or\nmagnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM).\n\n15.3 Payload Data Systems\n\nThe architecture and functionality of the payload data sys-\ntem varies more than the platform data system. There are\nhowever some common elements and a typical payload data\nsystem for a spacecraft with more than one payload\ninstrument is shown in Fig. 15.7.\n\nThe functions are\n\u2022 Instruments\u2014The payload instruments are the primary\n\nsources of data and the reason for the spacecraft being built.\nTypically a spacecraft carries several related instruments.\n\n\u2022 Data routing\u2014The data routing function forwards data\nfrom the payload instruments to one or more of the other\ncommon payload functions and comprises a multiplexer\nor router.\n\n\u2022 Data processing and compression\u2014An optional function\nthat performs general signal processing, compression or\ndata formatting tasks that have not been done in the\ninstruments.\n\n\u2022 Data storage and telemetry encoding\u2014The data storage\nfunction stores data for downlinking when the spacecraft\nis visible from a ground station. If the spacecraft is in a\ngeostationary orbit with 100 % downlink access, or data\nrelay satellites are used, there may not be a need for data\nstorage. The telemetry encoding function formats down-\nlink data for missions that need dedicated high-bandwidth\nRF links to facilitate a high data output rate. If the pay-\nload data rate is low or medium, the data will instead be\nsent to the platform data system, where the telemetry\nencoding is done.\n\n\u2022 Discrete I/O interfaces\u2014A discrete I/O handling function\nthat mainly manages the payload downlink RF system,\nwhich itself often consists of several units such as a\nmodulator, high power amplifier, antenna pointing motor\nwith associated drive electronics, and occasionally some\nRF switches.\nThe entire payload is connected to the platform data\n\nsystem via either a data bus or a high-speed link. If a data\nbus is used it is often connected to several functions inside\n\n450 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_3\n\n\nthe payload data system. If a high-speed link is used, it is\noften connected to the router function, which allows full\ncommunication with all functions to which it is connected.\n\n15.3.1 Instruments\n\nThe payload instruments on-board a spacecraft are the\nreason for the spacecraft being built. The instrument or set\nof instruments employed on a space mission will depend on\nthe science drivers for that mission. There are three main\ntypes of mission\n\u2022 Earth Observation missions, which orbit the Earth taking\n\nmeasurements of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface,\ntopography etc.\n\n\u2022 Science missions, which may orbit the Earth observing\ncelestial objects free from interference from the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere, or may travel to and possibly land on other\nobjects in the solar system in order to explore them.\n\n\u2022 Commercial missions, which include telecommunications\nand global positioning systems.\nInstruments for Earth observation and science missions\n\nmake measurements at various wavelengths of the electro-\nmagnetic spectrum and can be either passive, collecting\nradiation emitted by the observed body, or active, where the\ninstrument emits an electromagnetic signal and collects the\nreflection of this signal from the observed body. Some\nexample instruments will now be described.\n\n15.3.1.1 Passive Optical Instruments\nProbably the easiest passive instrument to understand is the\noptical imaging instrument or camera. The camera receives\nthe light radiated or reflected from the surface being sensed, it\nfocuses this light onto a focal plane to form an image, which is\ncollected by an imaging sensor, for example a charge couple\ndevice (CCD). The imaging sensor usually contains a two-\ndimensional array of individual sensors, called pixels. When\nilluminated by incoming radiation, the pixel sensor will\nconvert the photos to electrical charge. After a short period\naccumulating this charge, the whole image is read out. The\n\ncharge from the pixel is transferred to a special shift register\nthat reads out the pixels one by one. As it leaves the imaging\nsensor, the charge for each pixel is converted to a voltage\nand then digitized to produce the required digital image.\n\nThe imaging sensor may contain a more or less square\narrangement of pixels (e.g. 1,024 9 1,024 pixels) in which\ncase the entire image is collected in one go, as is the case\nwith a normal camera. Alternatively, the image may be long\nand thin (e.g. 17,000 9 1 pixel). This type of sensor is often\nused in Earth observation applications. In this case, the\nCCD array is organised with its long axis across the\ndirection of motion of the spacecraft and it images a line on\nthe ground across the track of the spacecraft. An image line\nis taken and transferred out of the CCD. In the meantime,\nthe spacecraft moves forward, so that the CCD next views a\nline on the ground adjacent to the first line, and so on. The\nprojection of the CCD on the ground (the area being imaged\nat one time) is like the head of a broom sweeping over the\nsurface, so this is called a push-broom imaging sensor.\n\nAn imaging sensor can capture spectral information\n(color) using filters, a prism, or a diffraction grating to\nseparate out the different spectral bands required. A separate\nCCD sensor may then be used for each spectral band. When\na push-broom sensor is being used, the spectral information\nis typically spread across the CCD sensor in the along-track\ndirection, e.g. using a prism, with the different spectral bands\nfalling on different pixels of the sensor. In this case several\npixels are required in the along-track direction, so the CCD\nmay be manufactured as, for example, a 17,000 9 32 pixel\nsensor with the 32 pixels in the along-track direction giving\n32 different spectral bands. An imaging instrument that\nrecords an image, sensing light in each pixel across its entire\nspectral range is call panchromatic. An instrument that\nseparates the image into a small number of spectral bands is\ncalled multispectral, and one that records the image into\nmany spectral bands is called hyperspectral.\n\nAs well as imaging visible light, an imaging sensor is\nalso able to record images in the ultraviolet and infrared.\nImaging in the thermal infrared is also possible, but requires\nthe imaging sensor to be cooled.\n\nFig. 15.7 Typical payload data\nsystem architecture\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 451\n\n\n\nThe CCDs doing the imaging have to be placed on the\nfocal plane of the optics, so that they receive a correctly\nfocused image. The assembly comprising the CCDs and\nrelated read-out electronics is thus called the focal plane\nassembly. If a single CCD does not have a sufficient number\nof pixels to cover the area required then several CCDs will\nbe butted together to form a larger CCD.\n\n15.3.1.2 Passive Microwave Instruments\nMolecules in the atmosphere excited by incoming energy\n(e.g. thermal energy or radiation from the Sun) will emit\nradiation when they drop back to their normal state. This\nradiation is emitted at a specific frequency or set of fre-\nquencies depending on the particular molecule, giving each\ntype of molecule a unique spectral signature. If the spec-\ntrum of the signal received by a radiometer is plotted then it\nis possible to determine the atmospheric constituents from\ntheir spectral signatures. Wind speed can also be measured\nfrom the Doppler shift of the spectral signatures. A passive\nmicrowave radiometer comprises an antenna to collect\nradiation from the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, a front-end receiver\nthat converts the microwaves into an electrical signal, and a\nback-end spectrometer that measures the spectrum of the\nreceived signal. The signal from the atmospheric compo-\nnents is very weak, especially compared to receiver noise.\nTo increase the signal to noise ratio and make the spectral\nsignatures of the atmospheric constituents visible, the\nreceived signal must be integrated for long periods.\n\n15.3.1.3 Active Microwave Instruments\nActive microwave instruments illuminate the target area\nwith a microwave signal and then collect the signal reflected\nback from the target. A radar altimeter is an example of a\nrelatively simple active sensor. It emits a pulse of radio\nfrequency energy, which propagates towards the target\nbody. This pulse hits the surface of the target body and\nsome energy is reflected back towards the instrument. This\nreflected energy is collected by the instrument\u2019s antenna\nand the time for the pulse to propagate from the spacecraft\ndown to the target body and back again is measured. Since\nthe speed of signal propagation is known, the distance from\nthe spacecraft to the target body can be determined. For a\nplanetary lander this distance above the surface is used to\ndeploy parachutes etc., at the right altitude. For an Earth\nobservation mission the orbit of the spacecraft is well\nknown, so the radar altimeter can be used to measure the\nmean height of the Earth\u2019s surface or the ocean\u2019s surface\nwithin the footprint of the radar. In addition to measuring\nheight, a radar altimeter is able to measure average wave\nheight over the ocean from the slope of the leading edge of\nthe radar return pulse, and wind speed from its amplitude.\n\nAnother active radar instrument is the synthetic aperture\nradar (SAR), which is able to provide images of the Earth\u2019s\n\nsurface both day and night, and even when there is complete\ncloud cover. It has an antenna that looks to the side of the\nsatellite track across the Earth, and combines the pulse\ncompression technique used in radar altimeters with a\nsimilar signal processing technique that takes advantage of\nthe along-track Doppler shift of the radar signal due to the\nmotion of the satellite, to compress the radar return signal in\norder to produce a two dimensional image.\n\nIn addition to instruments that operate passively by\nreceiving natural radiation from a surface, and those that\nactively sense the surface by sending out a signal to illu-\nminate the surface, there are some instruments that use\nsignals of opportunity: signal sources that illuminate the\nsurface but which do not originate from the instrument. An\nexample signal of opportunity is the signal produced by a\nglobal positioning system (GPS) satellite or by a TV\nbroadcast satellite.\n\n15.3.1.4 Instrument Data\nThe data from an instrument clearly depends on the par-\nticular type of instrument. The data rate may vary from tens\nof kbits/s for some instruments like radar altimeters up to\nseveral Gbits/s for hyperspectral imaging and synthetic\naperture radar instruments. On many spacecraft, a common\ndata format will be applied to data from most, if not all\ninstruments. Data from the instrument is packed into the\ncommon frame format before being passed to the data-\nhandling system. This can simplify the handling of data in\nthe mass memory unit. The data rate of the instruments will\ndrive the architecture of the on-board data-handling system,\nwith instruments requiring high data rates being connected\ndirectly to the mass memory unit and instruments with\nlower data rates being connected together by a bus or net-\nwork and then attached to the mass memory unit.\n\n15.3.2 Data Routing\n\nThe data routing function is responsible for passing data\nfrom the instruments to the data storage system, for passing\nconfiguration and control information to all of the instru-\nments and payload data-handling units, and for gathering\nhousekeeping information from the instruments. Instru-\nments can have dedicated high-speed data links to the data\nstorage system, or may share a bus or network resource. The\ndiscrete I/O interface could also be attached to the data\nrouting function instead of being connected to a payload\ndata bus.\n\nThe data routing function is typically implemented as a\nhigh-speed network with a central router or switch. A\nsimple data multiplexer was rather common in former\nspacecraft but is becoming rarer owing to ongoing advances\nin communications link technology.\n\n452 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\n15.3.3 Data Storage and Telemetry Encoding\n\nThe payload data system has a data storage capability,\nwhich from a functional point of view is rather similar to the\nplatform data storage function, i.e. it is used to store\ntelemetry data when there is no ground contact. However, in\nsome cases this memory is used to store other data. One\nexample might be the payload memory in a planetary\norbiter, which can be used to temporarily store data that is\nto be forwarded to rovers or to other spacecraft located on\nthe surface.\n\nThe size of the payload data storage is in the range from\nseveral hundred Gbit up to a few Tbit. The larger memories\nare used for missions that produce large amounts of data at a\nhigh rate, like Earth observation missions with high-reso-\nlution optical instruments or synthetic aperture radar\ninstruments. Since the large payload memories handle sig-\nnificantly higher data rates than the platform memories,\ntheir architecture is different. An example of a payload mass\nmemory architecture is found in Fig. 15.8.\n\nThe data arrives from the instruments via dedicated input\ninterfaces that perform initial data buffering and sometimes\ndata compression. Due to the large size of the memory,\nthere are several memory modules that are used in an M-\nout-of-N redundancy scheme in order to achieve the\nrequired reliability. An input routing mechanism forwards\nthe input data to the active memory modules using either\nparallel buses or high-speed serial links. When one memory\nmodule becomes full, the router forwards the data to the\nnext module in turn to receive data.\n\nWhen data is sent from the mass memory it passes a\nrouting mechanism that multiplexes data from the various\nmodules and sends it to the downlink telemetry encoder.\nThe payload telemetry encoder essentially works in the\nsame way as the platform telemetry encoder but at signifi-\ncantly higher data rates. The output data rates are often\ndefined by the capabilities of the RF modulators that typi-\ncally operate at 150/155 or 300/310 Mbps downlink. A\nslightly different Reed-Solomon coding RS(255,239), is\n\noften used to improve the coding overhead as there are only\n16 extra code bytes instead of 32 bytes in the RS(255,223)\ncode.\n\nAs discussed in Chap. 14, the telemetry encoder data is\npassed to the RF modulators, and then to the high power\namplifier that generates the final signal sent to the downlink\nantenna.\n\nTo manage the entire mass memory operation it is\ncommon to have a dedicated memory controller. This\nhandles the internal mass memory redundancy by powering\non and off the various input modules and memory modules.\nIt configures the memory module file system or packet\nstores, and sets up the output router and telemetry encoder\nwith the proper parameters. It also commands the input\nrouter such that it knows which memory module to use\nwhen the current module becomes full. The memory con-\ntroller is often based around a general purpose processor\nsince it receives rather complex commands from the plat-\nform computer, either via the payload data bus or via a\nhigh-speed serial link.\n\nFinally, there is normally an access path from the plat-\nform computer to the mass memory. This path is used to\nsend housekeeping telemetry packets that are necessary to\ninterpret the science data properly, like spacecraft attitude\nand position at regular points in time. For debugging pur-\nposes it is sometimes possible to read out the stored data to\nthe platform computer.\n\nFor the payload data storage there are only two common\nways to organize the data storage: file system or packet\nstores. The linear addressing sometimes used by platform\nmass memories is rarely used.\n\n15.3.4 Data Processing/Compression\n\nProcessing of data to support the control or operation of an\ninstrument is normally done within the instrument itself.\nThere are some processing functions that are applicable to\nmany instruments, or which do not involve any interaction\n\nFig. 15.8 Typical payload mass\nmemory architecture\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 453\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_14\n\n\nwith the instrument control function. An example is data\ncompression. These processing functions are normally\nimplemented in a separate unit or board within a unit.\n\nImaging sensors, especially multispectral or hyperspec-\ntral ones, and synthetic aperture radar sensors provide very\nhigh data rates that cannot be supported directly by the\ntelemetry downlink capacity. To cope with the large data\nrate, the data is stored in a mass memory unit and later\ndownlinked to Earth at a slower data rate. This means that\nthe high data rate instrument cannot collect data continu-\nously, or the mass memory would rapidly fill up. Instead, a\nsensing schedule is devised so that the instrument can sense\nimportant areas of terrain, saving the data to the mass\nmemory unit. It then has to wait until the data that has been\nrecorded has been sent to ground, before it can collect any\nmore data.\n\nOne way of increasing the effective downlink data rate\nand thereby reduce the time to send the information to\nground, is to compress the data. For an imaging instrument\nthis is normally done using JPEG or wavelet-based com-\npression techniques. The degree of compression that can be\nachieved is typically of the order of 4:1 for Earth obser-\nvation data. At this level of compression there is very little\neffect on the scientific information contained within each\nimage, and it is possible to gather four times as much data.\nThis is considered a good trade-off for many applications.\n\n15.3.5 Discrete Input/Output Interfaces\n\nThe payload control function using discrete interfaces is\nrather similar to the platform sensor data collection and\nactuator commanding described in Sect. 15.1.5. For a sci-\nentific or Earth observation mission it mainly consists of\nmonitoring and controlling the data downlink parts\n\u2022 Modulator (temperature, voltage and single status bits)\n\u2022 High power amplifier (temperature, voltage and single\n\nstatus bits)\n\u2022 Antenna pointing motor with associated drive electronics\n\u2022 RF switches (single status bits).\n\nApart from the antenna pointing motor electronics\n(APME), all these units are rather simple and the main\ninterfaces are connected to Type A sensors and actuators\nlike thermistors. The APME, on the other hand, can be\nrather complex depending on the antenna pointing\nrequirements. In the simplest application, it just drives two\nstepper motors with the number of commanded steps per\nsecond in a commanded direction. This concept may induce\nunwanted vibration due to the rather fast acceleration and\nretardation of the motor. A more complex motor driver uses\nmicro-stepping. When micro-stepping, a single motor step\nis divided into say 16 sub-steps, each of which forms one\n\npoint of a ? sine/cosine wave in order to give a smooth\ntransition between two motor positions. This solution\nreduces the vibration problems and other problems that may\noccur when the stepper motor commanding frequency\ncoincides with a mechanical resonance frequency. Moving\nlarge payload masses also affects the spacecraft dynamics\nand the AOCS system. Thus, the motor controller is often\nbuilt as a separate unit and controlled from the platform\ncomputer directly via the payload data bus.\n\nIn telecom satellites the payload control function must\ncontrol the many different units that make up the payload.\nThe command/monitoring interfaces of these units are also\nrather simple, but the raw quantity will lead to hundreds and\neven thousands of inputs and outputs to the payload control\nfunction. The trend is therefore to decentralize the com-\nmanding and data acquisition as much as possible, and to\nrun local data buses and data links between the payload\ncontroller and the units to control.\n\nScientific, optical, and radar instruments often include\ntheir own control and monitoring. In this way the instrument\ncan be built independently from the payload data system\nand only interfaced by the high-speed data output, a control\nbus and a few simple interfaces like On/Off pulse com-\nmands, On/Off status, and maybe a temperature sensor.\n\n15.4 Recent On-Board Data System\nProcessing Technologies\n\nThe evolution of technology for data processing in terres-\ntrial application has been very fast during past decades.\nAccording to Moore\u2019s law the number of transistors per\nchip doubles every few years (the specific number has been\nrevised over the years) and the performance increases in a\nsimilar way. Although the maximum clock frequency of\nprocessors seems to have reached a limit, the performance is\ninstead increased by putting more processors per chip. In\nterrestrial applications, quad core CPUs are now standard\neven in mid-range computers and mobile handsets.\n\nThe processors useful for space applications show a\nsimilar evolution, but with the difference that new proces-\nsors appear at intervals of several years instead of a new\nprocessor every year as happens on the terrestrial market.\nHowever, the trend seems to be a lower rate of performance\nincrease and there is a lag of 6\u20138 years between the com-\nmercial introduction of a technology in products and the\nintroduction of that technology in space products. As the\nperformance increase is slower, the lag is expected to\nincrease.\n\nThe two following subsections describe the status of the\nmain processing solutions for space in 2011.\n\n454 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\n15.4.1 SPARC Processors\n\nLEON is an open source processor originally developed by\nthe European Space Research and Technology Centre\n(ESTEC), part of the European Space Agency (ESA), and\nafter that by Gaisler Research. The first widely used open\nversion is LEON2, which has been extended with some\nfault-tolerance features to become LEON2-FT. The LEON2\nprocessor is no longer supported, while LEON2-FT can be\nlicensed from ESA to entities belonging to countries that are\nESA members or procured as a packaged chip from Atmel\n(in two different versions).\n\nThe LEON3 processor is a further development made by\nGaisler Research, now called Aeroflex Gaisler. LEON3 is\nalso available in two versions; an open version under GNU\nGPL license and a commercial version called LEON3-FT.\nThe most recent development is LEON4, which is only\navailable in a commercial version.\n\nThe LEON processor family is based on the SPARC?-\nV8 architecture [16]. The main difference between LEON2\nand LEON3 is a deeper pipeline and a single-edge clock\ndesign. The LEON3 support tools for both hardware and\nsoftware design are also more advanced than the LEON2\ntools. LEON4 has been further evolved using wider internal\ndata buses and the possibility of having both level 1 (L1)\nand level 2 (L2) caches.\n\nThere are about ten different application specific inte-\ngrated circuit (ASIC) implementations made by European\ncompanies like Aeroflex Gaisler, Astrium, and RUAG,\nusing radiation-hardened or radiation-tolerant technology\nwith the LEON2-FT or the LEON3-FT processors, with\nroughly an equal split between the two versions. Most of the\nimplementations are available commercially from either the\ndesign house or an ASIC vendor. The designs use 0.25 l or\n0.18 l process technology, and the performance ranges\nfrom 50 to 100 MHz clock frequency. LEON will be the\ndominating processor in European missions launched from\n2014 onwards, after the Galileo and GMES programs that\nstill uses the TSC695 SPARC?-V7 architecture processor.\nThis processor has dominated the European market for\nspace computers since the early 2000s.\n\n15.4.2 PowerPC Processors\n\nPowerPC was developed by IBM/Motorola/Apple. It has\nbeen used by Apple in desktop PCs but is today widespread\nin many embedded applications. PowerPC is an evolution of\nthe IBM POWER architecture, and there are space pro-\ncessors developed from both architectures. BAE Systems\nhas developed the RAD6000 processor, based on the IBM\nRSC chip that implements the POWER architecture. The\n\nRAD6000 has been used in many missions, including seven\nmissions to Mars. RAD6000 was manufactured in a 0.5 l\nprocess and operates up to a maximum of 33 MHz.\n\nBAE Systems has also developed the RAD750 proces-\nsor, based on the IBM PowerPC 750, which belongs to the\nthird generation of commercial PowerPC processors. The\nRAD750 is made in two different versions; in a 0.25 l\nprocess operating up to 132 MHz and in a 0.15 l process\noperating up to 200 MHz.\n\nHoneywell has developed the RHPPC processor, based\non the Motorola PowerPC 603e, which belongs to the sec-\nond generation of commercial PowerPC processors. The\nRHPPC is manufactured in a 0.35 l process and operates up\nto 80 MHz.\n\nMaxwell has developed a board based on three IBM\nPowerPC 750FX processors operated in triple modular\nredundancy (TMR) such that an SEU will only interrupt the\nprocessing for about 1 ms. The board makes use of the fact\nthat shrinking process dimensions of commercial circuitry\nautomatically results in circuits tolerating rather large total\nradiation doses, thus needing no special processing for\nspace applications. The design also benefits from the\ncommercial IBM processor, processed in a 0.13 l Silicon-\non-Insulator (SOI) technology, being unusually insensitive\nto SEUs caused by protons and heavy ions. The CPUs are\noperated between 400 and 800 MHz.\n\n15.4.3 MIPS: Microprocessor Without\nInterlocked Pipeline Stages Processors\n\nThe MIPS architecture was first introduced in the US with\nthe RH32 and RH3000 processors and is now continued in\nJapan with the HR5000 CPU based on the MIPS IV\narchitecture.\n\n15.5 Recent On-Board Data System\nCommunication Networks\nTechnologies\n\nThe following subsections give a brief overview of some of\nthe most common data links used in spacecraft applications.\nTo get a deeper understanding and more detailed descrip-\ntions, it is recommended that the reader consult the relevant\nstandards and handbooks. These open standards are often\nused as applicable documents in space projects and can be\nfound either on the Internet or in company and institutional\nlibraries and document data bases. It should be noted that\nboth MIL-STD 1553B and SpaceWire are also discussed in\nChap. 16 from a software perspective, giving a slightly\ndifferent view of these technologies.\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 455\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_16\n\n\n15.5.1 MIL-STD-1553B\n\nThe bus defined by MIL-STD-1553B [17] is the most\ncommonly used serial data bus in current spacecraft. It\noriginated from the US Department of Defense in the 1970s\nand due to its widespread use in military aircraft and\nspacecraft for many years there is significant heritage and\nknowledge in industry. Even if it is more than 35 years old,\nthe 1553 data bus still has sufficient data transfer capability\nfor the control functions implemented in a spacecraft plat-\nform like attitude and orbit control, thermal control, battery\nmanagement, and control of some payloads. The main\nadvantages of the 1553 data bus are\n\u2022 A single pair of wires is used, making it possible to use\n\nvery small and simple connectors.\n\u2022 Robust against noise and ground potential variations\n\nsince it uses transformer coupled interfaces with high\nvoltage levels and input signal filtering.\n\n\u2022 Can be routed up to 30 meters, which covers the distances\nseen in even large spacecraft. When used in launchers\nthere may be a need for bus repeaters to cover both the\nlarge distances and the separation between launcher\nstages.\n\n\u2022 Sufficient availability of components that tolerate the\nspace environment and that fulfill the quality require-\nments for space applications.\n\n\u2022 Inherent redundancy features like dual bus lanes and rules\nfor how to use the redundancy.\nThere are however a number of drawbacks\n\n\u2022 The peak power consumption when transmitting on the\nbus is quite high. About 3 W of secondary power is\nneeded and, as the power consumption while not trans-\nmitting is very low when using modern components, the\nvariation in power consumption often results in electro-\nmagnetic compatibility (EMC) problems related to low\nfrequency conducted emission on the primary power bus.\n\n\u2022 The harness is rather bulky because it includes embedded\ntransformers.\n\n\u2022 The interface circuitry is complex and occupies more\nprinted circuit board space than required by other buses.\n\n\u2022 The interface circuitry implementation is also complex.\nThere is an associated handbook [18] consisting of sev-\neral hundred pages where one major topic is the electrical\ninterface and all aspects to consider in its\nimplementation.\nDespite these drawbacks, it is expected that the 1553\n\ndata bus will continue in use in several future spacecraft.\n\n15.5.1.1 Low Level Protocol Summary\nThe 1553 data bus connects two types of nodes, one bus\ncontroller (BC) and a number of remote terminals (RT). The\nbus uses a master\u2013slave protocol where the BC is the\n\ninitiator of all transfers. Three types of transfers are possi-\nble: BC to RT, RT to BC, and RT to RT. The latter is rarely\nused and is not discussed further in this book.\n\nAll transactions, also called messages, start with the BC\nissuing a command word that determines the RT to be\ninvolved in the transaction, an RT sub-address indicating\none of 30 separate register banks inside the RT, the number\nof data words to be transferred (from 1 to 32), and whether\nit is a BC ? RT transfer or a RT ? BC transfer. The RT is\ndetermined by a 5 bit RT address field where address 31\nindicates a broadcast transfer, i.e. all RTs connected to the\nbus may receive data. It is not possible to transmit data from\nthe RTs using broadcast addressing.\n\nIn the case of a BC ? RT transfer, the BC starts to\ntransmit the data words immediately after the command\nword. When all of the data words have been sent the bus is\nleft idle for some time until the addressed RT responds with\na status word that gives information on whether the transfer\nwas successful or not. The RT must start its response within\n12 ls from the end of the last data word.\n\nIn the case of an RT ? BC transfer, the BC stops\ntransmitting after the commands word and the addressed RT\nresponds with a status word that gives information on\nwhether the transfer can be carried out or not, and then\nimmediately transmits the requested number of data words.\n\nIn addition to the data transfers there are control com-\nmands, called mode commands. These are recognized by\nthe RT sub-address being 0 or 31 and they may also result in\na single data word being transmitted, either from the BC to\nthe RT or from the RT to the BC.\n\nAll words are transmitted at a rate of 1 Mbps. A word\nlasts for 20 ls and consists of the following parts in order of\nappearance\n\u2022 A unique pattern lasting 3 ls indicating whether it is a\n\ncommand word or a data word. The pattern is the same\nfor command words and status words.\n\n\u2022 16 bits of command info, data, or status info.\n\u2022 One parity bit generated from the 16 data bits. Odd parity\n\nis used.\nSince the data bus is transformer coupled, the electrical\n\nsignal level must be DC-balanced in order to avoid trans-\nformer saturation and overshoot problems when the bus\ntransfers are completed. The signal modulation used is\ncalled Manchester coding or split phase level (SPL) coding\nand is a special case of binary phase shift keying (BPSK)\nwith one subcarrier period per data bit.\n\n15.5.1.2 Higher Level Protocols\nThe basic 1553 standard only defines how to transfer indi-\nvidual messages of up to 64 bytes. With such a protocol it is\npossible to control simple devices that only need or produce\na few bytes of data. If larger data structures like CCSDS\n\n456 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\nspace packets or files must be transferred then a protocol\nmust be implemented on top of the basic 1553 message\nprotocol. Traditionally such protocols have been invented\nby equipment suppliers and prime contractors. This has\nmade it difficult to reuse software (and sometimes hard-\nware) between various spacecraft.\n\nIn 2008 there was an international standard released\nwithin the ECSS system [19] specifying the communica-\ntions layer above the data link layer. In the ISO OSI model\nthis layer is called the network layer and [19] covers parts of\nthis layer. The ECSS standard defines the following proto-\ncol services that use the basic 1553 messages as underlying\nprotocol\n\u2022 Time synchronization\n\u2022 Time distribution\n\u2022 Communication synchronization\n\u2022 Data block transfer\n\u2022 Terminal management.\n\nBy 2012, the ECSS standard was used in almost all new\nEuropean missions having 1553 data buses.\n\n15.5.1.3 Communication Scheduling\nThe 1553 data bus is a serial communications bus with a\nrather low speed. A full size message carrying 64 bytes\noccupies the bus for about 700 ls and it cannot be inter-\nrupted. Thus, it is not possible for software to perform\nurgent random data accesses over the bus in order to access\nsensors and actuators. Instead, the bus traffic must be\nscheduled to meet the performance requirements in terms of\nbandwidth and latency. The latency is basically the time\nbetween the transfer request being made by the software\nand the transfer being completed on the data bus (Fig. 15.9).\n\n1553 data bus engineers have classically scheduled the\nbus communication using so called major and minor frames.\nThe duration of major frames is typically 1 s and is adapted\nto control functions that have the same periodicity, like time\nmanagement, thermal control, and battery management.\nSome applications have also introduced \u2018super frames\u2019 with\na period of, for example, 10 s to run the thermal control.\nThe minor frame often coincides with the AOCS control\nloop, and is in the order of 100 ms.\n\nWith a minor frame having the same length as the AOCS\ncontrol cycle, there must be some interaction between the\nsoftware and the 1553 bus controller hardware during the\nframe, for instance to read the acquired sensor values or to\nwrite the generated actuator control commands. Most 1553\ncontrollers have advanced list management mechanisms\nthat facilitate transmitting multiple messages in a single\nsoftware operation. Quite often these lists may even be\ntriggered without software interaction, by hardware events\ngenerated for instance by the on-board time function. To\navoid frequent interaction between hardware and software,\n[19] has introduced a third element, the communication\n\nframe. The rationale for this frame is that the interaction\nbetween the hardware and the software only occurs at the\nframe boundaries, thereby simplifying both the software\nand the communications scheduling. This principle is\nshown by an example in Fig. 15.10.\n\nIn the example shown in Fig. 15.10, there are four\ncommunication frames per minor frame. A typical AOCS\ncontrol loop would acquire the sensor data via the data bus\nduring frame 0, perform the control algorithm processing\nduring frame 1 and frame 2 and send out the control com-\nmands on the data bus during frame 3. During frame 1 and\nframe 2 the data bus transfers typically contain data related\nto other control functions like thermal control and moni-\ntoring. The resulting latency is a maximum of one com-\nmunication frame, which is 25 ms in the example. If shorter\nlatencies are needed a shorter communication frame should\nbe selected.\n\nThe example shown in Fig. 15.10 also clearly shows\nhow the data bus communication can cooperate with the\nsoftware in a deterministic time-triggered mode instead of\nthe earlier event driven modes that make the software less\npredictable and more error prone.\n\n15.5.2 CAN: Controller Area Network\n\nA controller area network (CAN) is a bus standard devised\nfor automobile applications that allows various devices on\nthe bus to send data to one another [20, 21]. It is a serial bus\nthat typically runs over a 2-wire differential interface and\nprovides a multi-master, message-based communications\nprotocol. CAN has been used in many small satellites for\npayload data-handling and control applications, where the\ndata rate requirements are low.\n\nA CAN has a number of features that make it attractive\nfor space applications\n\u2022 It can send data at up to 1 Mbits/s over distances of 40 m.\n\u2022 Any node can send a message to be received by one or\n\nmore other nodes.\n\u2022 Data delivered and accepted by multiple nodes is guar-\n\nanteed to be the same, consistent data.\n\u2022 Messages are delivered according to a fixed priority\n\nscheme.\n\u2022 The latency of message transmission is fixed, providing\n\ntime-synchronization of nodes receiving a message.\n\u2022 Error are detected and signaled to other nodes.\n\u2022 Messages that are corrupted are retransmitted as soon as\n\nthe bus becomes idle.\nA CAN is not galvanically isolated, although opto-cou-\n\nplers can be used to provide galvanic isolation.\nThe CAN protocols are divided into three layers\n\n\u2022 CAN object layer, which determines when messages are\nto be transmitted and what received messages are to be\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 457\n\n\n\npassed up to the application. It provides the message\nhandling and status interfaces to the application.\n\n\u2022 CAN transfer layer, which is responsible for transferring\nmessages between nodes. It provides bit timing, syn-\nchronization, message framing, arbitration, error check-\ning, error signaling and fault confinement functions.\n\n\u2022 CAN physical layer, which defines the electrical prop-\nerties of the medium to permit the transfer of bits\nbetween nodes. Various forms of physical layer can be\nused.\nTogether the transfer layer and the object layer provide\n\nthe services and functions of the ISO/OSI link layer.\nThere are four different frame types used in a CAN\n\n\u2022 Data frames, which carry data from the transmitting node\nto the other nodes on the bus.\n\n\u2022 Remote request frames, which are sent by one node to\nrequest one of the other nodes on the bus to transmit some\nspecific type of information, this being subsequently\ntransmitted in a data frame.\n\n\u2022 Error frames, which are transmitted to indicate that an\nerror has been detected.\n\n\u2022 Overload frames, which are used to provide an additional\ndelay between one data or remote frame and the next.\n\n15.5.2.1 Data Frames\nThe data frame format is illustrated in Fig. 15.11. The start\nof frame is 0, which follows a series of 1\u2019s from the inter-\nframe space. A node on the bus is only permitted to start\ntransmitting a frame when the bus is idle (1). The start of\nframe is used to provide initial bit-synchronization and\nframe synchronization.\n\nThe arbitration field contains an 11-bit field which\nidentifies the type of information being broadcast, and\nwhere it comes from. No two nodes can transmit the same\nvalue in the arbitration field. In addition, the arbitration field\ncontains a remote transmission request bit, which is 0 in a\ndata frame, and 1 in a remote request frame. The arbitration\nfield can also contain an extended identifier, which is 29-\nbits in total.\n\nThe control field contains an identifier extension bit that\nindicates whether the frame is a base frame (set to 0) or an\nextended frame (set to 1), a reserved bit (set to 0), and a 4-\nbit data length that indicates how many data bytes are\ncontained in the data field (0\u20138 bytes).\n\nThe CRC field contains a 15-bit cyclic redundancy check\nsequence together with a 1-bit CRC delimiter, which is set\nto 1. The CRC code covers the start of frame, arbitration,\n\nFig. 15.9 1553 data bus\nmessages\n\nFig. 15.10 1553 data bus\ntransfer scheduling\n\n458 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\ncontrol, and data fields, using a CRC code suited for frames\nof less than 127 bits.\n\nThe ACK field comprises two bits: the ACK slot followed\nby the ACK delimiter. The transmitter sets both of these bits\nto 1. Any receiver which receives the message without error\nwill set the ACK slot to 0, which indicates to the transmitter\nthat the message has been received successfully.\n\nThe end of frame completes the frame with a sequence of\nseven bits set to 1.\n\nAn extended data frame is similar to the base data frame\nexcept that it contains an additional identifier field. The\nextended data frame has the identifier extension bit in the\ncontrol field set to 1, an additional 18-bit identifier field, and\nan extra \u2018substitute\u2019 remote request bit which is set to 1. The\nextended data frame permits more address and message\ntype information to be included within a message.\n\n15.5.2.2 Remote Request Frames\nA remote request frame is the same as a data frame except\nthat the remote transmission request bit in the arbitration\nfield is set to 1 to indicate that it is a remote request, and\nthere is no data field.\n\nTo ensure that the receiver can maintain correct bit\nsynchronization and to support error signaling, the bit\nsequences for data or remote frames are encoded using bit\nstuffing before they are transmitted. If there is a sequence of\nfive consecutive bits of identical value, the transmitter will\nautomatically insert an extra bit of the opposite value. This\nmeans that there will never normally be a sequence of six or\nmore bits of the same value. Bit stuffing is applied to the\nstart of frame, arbitration, control, data and CRC fields of\nthe data or remote frames. The other fields are of fixed\nformat and are not subject to bit stuffing.\n\n15.5.2.3 Error Frames\nIf a node detects an error while receiving a data frame or\nremote frame, it will transmit an error frame. The error\nframe consists of an error flag and an error delimiter. If the\nnode is in error active state, the error flag is an active error\nflag, which comprises six bits all set to 0, otherwise it is a\npassive error flag, which comprises six bits all set to 1. The\nerror frame therefore violates the rule that no more than five\n\nconsecutive bits of the same value will be transmitted, or\nviolates the fixed structure of the ACK field and end of\nframe. This means that all nodes on the bus will detect the\nfact that an error has occurred.\n\n15.5.2.4 Overload Frames\nThe overload frame is similar to the error frame, signaling\nthat at least one receiver needs some additional time before\nit will be ready to receive the next message.\n\n15.5.2.5 Bus Arbitration Mechanism\nIf two or more nodes decide to start transmitting a data or\nremote frame at the same time there will be a clash of the two\nframes on the bus. To resolve this problem a CAN uses\ndominant (0) and recessive (1) bit values. A dominant value\non the bus will override any recessive values on the bus, in a\nsimilar manner to a wired-AND, open drain operation. Each\nnode is given a unique identifier, which is transmitted in the\narbitration field. The first bit from both nodes will be the start\nof frame bit, which is 0 so that both nodes agree. As the next\nbits are sent, eventually one node will send a 1 and the other\na 0. The node that sent the 0 wins (is dominant) and the node\nthat tried to transmit a 1 but saw a 0 on the bus instead, will\ncease transmitting. therefore the node with the lowest value\nidentifier will win the arbitration and be permitted to send its\nmessage. Nodes that fail to win arbitration get another\nchance once the current frame has been transmitted. The\nCAN arbitration process is illustrated in Fig. 15.12.\n\nThe message identifiers must be unique in order to pre-\nvent two nodes with the same identifier sending messages\nthat both get through arbitration but subsequently interfere\nwith one another, resulting in an error. The allocation of\nidentifiers can be done according to the sending node and\nthe type of data being transferred. However, more efficient\nuse of the bus bandwidth can be achieved by allocating the\nidentifiers according to the deadline of the message. The\nshorter the deadline, the lower the identifier value, giving\nhigher message priority.\n\nEach node has its own clock for generating and receiving\nbits of CAN messages, which are nominally of the same\nfrequency. The receivers all synchronize on the falling edge\nof the start of message field. An oversampling scheme is\n\nFig. 15.11 CAN bus data frame\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 459\n\n\n\nthen used to determine where to sample subsequent bits as\nindicated in Fig. 15.13. Re-synchronization occurs every\ntime there is a falling edge in the bit stream.\n\n15.5.2.6 CANopen\nCANopen [22] is a higher layer protocol for CAN which has\nbeen adopted and extended by ESA for spacecraft appli-\ncations [23, 24].\n\nThe CANopen protocol stack is illustrated in Fig. 15.14.\nAn object dictionary provides the interface between the\napplication and the CAN network. Present in each CAN\ndevice, the object dictionary describes the functionality,\nparameters, and data pool of that device. The object dic-\ntionary is split into two parts: general specifications, which\ninclude a standardized device profile area and manufacturer\nspecific information; and device specific specifications,\nwhich include the data area providing access to the data,\nand the data type information and the communications\nprofile area, which define the communication mechanisms\nin use and related parameters.\n\nThe CANopen communications interface lies between\nthe object dictionary and the CAN bus and provides a range\nof communications services.\n\nProcess data objects (PDO) are used to communicate real-\ntime information over the CAN bus. Transmit PDOs are for\nreading data from a device and receive PDOs are for sending\ndata to a device. A PDO can transfer 8 bytes of data to or\nfrom a device, using the basic CAN bus communications\nfacilities. A PDO can contain one or more object dictionary\nentries. The data objects to be transferred in a PDO are\nconfigurable via the mapping and parameter entries in the\n\ncommunications profile area of the object dictionary. PDOs\ncan be sent asynchronously, on request, or in response to an\nevent occurring in the device; or synchronously following\nreception of a synchronization object (SYNC). Synchronous\ndata transmission can be cyclic, after a specified number of\nSYNCs have been received; acyclic, on receipt of the SYNC\nfollowing the occurrence of an event, and by request, on\nreceipt of SYNC after a request to send data.\n\nService data objects (SDOs) are used for device config-\nuration and sending larger amounts of data than can be sent\nin a single CAN frame. The SDO implements segmentation\nand de-segmentation of messages larger than the 8 byte limit\nof a CAN frame. An SDO uses a client-server communica-\ntions model to read and write values in object dictionary in a\nremote node. The SDO client can have direct access to the\nobject dictionary entries of another SDO server node. Two\nCAN identifiers are used to define one SDO channel, one for\nthe client request and the other for the server response.\n\nCANopen provides several network management functions\n\u2022 Synchronization object (SYNC), used to synchronize the\n\ncollection and transmission of data from various devices,\nand to provide high resolution time synchronization.\n\n\u2022 Time stamp object (TIME), which contains time infor-\nmation in milliseconds and can be used together with\nSYNC to provide higher resolution time synchronization\nof nodes.\n\n\u2022 Emergency object, which is a high priority message, used\nby a device to signal that an internal fatal error has\noccurred.\n\n\u2022 Node control service, which is used to adjust the state of a\nnode, allowing a network management node to cause a\nnode to initialize, become operational or halt.\n\n\u2022 Heartbeat service, where a node periodically signals its\nstatus.\n\n\u2022 Node guarding service, where a network manager peri-\nodically polls every node to check that they are still in\noperation.\n\n\u2022 Life guarding service, where a node will signal to its\napplication if it has not been polled by the network\nmanager within a specified period of time.\n\nFig. 15.12 CAN bus arbitration\nprocess\n\nFig. 15.13 CAN bus bit sampling\n\n460 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\n15.5.2.7 CAN for Space\nESA have adopted CANopen as a higher layer protocol for\nthe CAN bus, providing some extensions and recommen-\ndations to make it suitable for spacecraft applications [23,\n24]. The extended identifier is used and a large data unit\ntransfer (LDUT) protocol has been defined, which is rec-\nommended for segmented data transmission. A time dis-\ntribution protocol has been added using dedicated PDOs to\ndistribute spacecraft elapsed time (SCET) or universal time\ncoordinated (UTC) time.\n\nRecommendations are also made for bus architectures\nimplementing redundancy.\n\nSome manufacturers of spacecraft have implemented\ntheir own higher layer protocols [25].\n\n15.5.3 SpaceWire\n\nSpaceWire is a communications network designed specifi-\ncally for use on-board spacecraft to connect together\ninstruments, mass memory, processors, downlink telemetry,\nand other subsystems [26\u201328].\n\nSpaceWire is simple to implement and has some specific\ncharacteristics that help it to support data-handling\n\napplications in space: high-speed, low-power, simplicity,\nrelatively low implementation cost, and a flexible archi-\ntectural it adaptable to many space missions. SpaceWire\nprovides high speed (2\u2013200 Mbits/s), bidirectional, full\nduplex data links, which connect together SpaceWire\nenabled equipment. SpaceWire can be used to provide a\ndirect connection between two units, for example, from an\ninstrument to the mass memory unit. More complex data-\nhandling networks can be built to suit particular applica-\ntions using point-to-point data-links and routing switches.\n\nSpaceWire is not galvanically isolated. Depending on the\nnetwork topology and command mechanisms, SpaceWire\nmay not be deterministic, so it cannot be used for command\nand control applications without due care. A deterministic\ndata delivery protocol for SpaceWire is currently under\ndevelopment.\n\nThe SpaceWire standard was originally published in\nJanuary 2003, and since then ESA, NASA and JAXA have\nused it for many scientific and Earth observation spacecraft.\nSpaceWire is also being used on several commercial\nspacecraft. High-profile missions using SpaceWire include:\nGaia, Bepi-Colombo, Sentinel-1, 2-, -3 and -5-precursor,\nJames Webb Space Telescope, GOES-R, Lunar Recon-\nnaissance Orbiter, and Astro-H.\n\nFig. 15.14 CANopen protocols\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 461\n\n\n\n15.5.3.1 SpaceWireLinks\nSpaceWire links are point-to-point data links that connect\ntogether a SpaceWire node (e.g. instrument, processor, mass\nmemory unit) to another node or to a router. Information\ncan be transferred over both directions of the link at the\nsame time. Each link sends information as a serial bit\nstream using two signals in each direction (data and strobe).\nThese signals are driven across the link using low voltage\ndifferential signaling (LVDS) [29] which requires two wires\nfor each signal, resulting in a SpaceWire cable containing\nfour screened twisted pairs.\n\n15.5.3.2 SpaceWire Characters and Control Codes\nThe data characters, control characters, and control codes that\ncan be sent over a SpaceWire link are illustrated in Fig. 15.15.\n\nEach character starts with a parity bit that covers the data\nbits of the previous character and the parity and control bit\nof the current character. The parity bit is followed by a data/\ncontrol flag, which is 0 for a data character and 1 for a\ncontrol character. Data characters have eight data bits which\ncontain a byte of data. Control characters have two bits\nwhich indicate the type of character, namely\n\n\u2022 Flow control token, which is responsible for managing\nthe flow of data across a link, to ensure that data is sent\nonly when there is room for it at the other end of the link.\n\n\u2022 End of packet (EOP) marker, which is used to signal the\nend of a SpaceWire packet.\n\n\u2022 Error end of packet (EEP) marker, which is used to ter-\nminate a packet which has been cut off prematurely,\nbecause of an error on the link.\n\n\u2022 Escape (ESC), which is used to construct control codes.\nThe two control codes are Null, which is ESC followed\n\nby an FCT, and the time-code, which is ESC followed by a\ndata character.\n\nThe characters can be divided into three types\n\u2022 Normal characters (N-Chars) used to form SpaceWire\n\npackets which are made up of data characters, EOPs, and\nEEPs. These characters are passed to/from the user\napplication by a SpaceWire interface.\n\n\u2022 Link control characters (L-Chars) used to initialise and\nmaintain the running of a SpaceWire link, made up of\nNulls and FCTs.\n\n\u2022 Time-codes used to broadcast time or synchronisation\ninformation over a SpaceWire network.\n\nFig. 15.15 SpaceWire data\ncharacters, control characters,\nand control codes\n\n462 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\nThe SpaceWire characters are transmitted serially using\ndata/strobe encoding to provide a clock signal for recover-\ning the bits making up the characters at the other end of the\nSpaceWire link. Data/strobe encoding combines the serial\nbit clock and the data stream to form a strobe signal in such\na way that XORing (XOR, \u2018Exclusive Or\u2019) the data and\nstrobe signal recovers the clock signal. The data and strobe\nare then transmitted using LVDS. Data/strobe encoding is\nused instead of simply sending the bit clock along with the\ndata, because it provides better skew tolerance.\n\nEach SpaceWire interface contains a link state-machine\nwhich is responsible for starting a link, keeping the link\nrunning, sending data over the link, ensuring that data is not\nsent if the receiver is not ready for it, and recovering from\nany errors on the link. The operation of the link state-\nmachine is transparent to the user application that wishes to\nsend data over the link.\n\n15.5.3.3 SpaceWire Packets\nInformation is transferred across a SpaceWire link in dis-\ntinct packets. Packets can be sent in either direction of the\nlink, provided that there is room in the receiver for more\ndata. The SpaceWire packet is formatted as illustrated in\nFig. 15.16.\n\nThe destination address is a list of data characters that\nrepresents either the identity of the destination node or the\npath that the packet has to take through a SpaceWire net-\nwork to reach to the destination node. In the case of a point-\nto-point link directly between two nodes (no routers in\nbetween) the destination address is not necessary.\n\nThe cargo is the data to be transferred from source to\ndestination. Any number of data bytes can be transferred in\nthe cargo of a SpaceWire packet.\n\nThe data character following the EOP marker is the start\nof the next packet. There is no limit on the size of a\nSpaceWire packet.\n\nSpaceWire packets can be used to carry a range of user\nprotocols, with minimal overhead.\n\n15.5.3.4 SpaceWire Networks\nSpaceWire networks are constructed using SpaceWire\npoint-to-point links and routing switches. A SpaceWire\nrouter [27] connects together many nodes using SpaceWire\nlinks, providing a means of routing packets from one node\nto any of the other nodes or routers attached to the router.\nA node is simply the source or destination of a SpaceWire\npacket. A SpaceWire router comprises a number of\nSpaceWire link interfaces and a switch matrix. The switch\n\nmatrix enables packets arriving at one link interface to be\ntransferred to and sent out on another link interface on the\nrouter.\n\nEach link interface may be considered as comprising an\ninput port (the link interface receiver) and an output port\n(the link interface transmitter). A SpaceWire router trans-\nfers packets from the input port of the routing switch where\nthe packet arrives, to a particular output port determined by\nthe packet destination address. A router uses the leading\ndata character of a packet (one of the destination address\ncharacters) to determine the output port of the router to\nwhich the packet is to be forwarded. The destination address\nis the first part of the packet to be sent so that a router,\nwhich is responsible for forwarding the packet along the\nnext link towards its destination, only has to receive the first\ncharacter of a packet before making the decision about\nwhere the packet is to be routed. This makes routing very\nfast provided no other packet is currently using the link that\nthe packet is to be forwarded along. If there are two input\nports waiting to use a particular output port, when the\nprevious packet has finished being sent an arbitration\nmechanism inside the router decides which of the waiting\ninput ports is to be served next. The other one has to wait\nuntil the output port becomes free once more.\n\nSpaceWire is able to support many different payload\nprocessing architectures using point-to-point links and\nrouting switches. The data-handling architecture can be\nconstructed to suit the requirements of a specific mission,\nrather than having to force the application onto a restricted\nbus or network with restricted topology.\n\n15.5.3.5 Packet Addressing\nThe destination address at the front of a SpaceWire packet\nis used to route the packet through a network from the\nsource node to the destination. There are two forms of\naddressing used in SpaceWire networks: path addressing\nand logical addressing.\n\nPath addressing has one byte in the destination address\nfor each router on the path from the source to the destina-\ntion. When the packet arrives at a router, the router takes off\nthe first byte of the packet and uses it to determine which\nport to forward the rest of the packet through. For example,\nif the leading byte is 3 the packet is forwarded through port\n3 of the router. If the packet header is 3, 2, 4 the packet will\nbe routed through port 3 at the first router it encounters,\nthrough port 2 at the next one, and finally through port 4 at\nthe last router before it reaches its destination. At each\nrouter the leading character is used to determine where to\n\nFig. 15.16 SpaceWire packet format\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 463\n\n\n\nforward the packet and is then discarded to reveal the next\naddress character for use at the next router. A router has an\ninternal configuration port (port 0) and up to 31 external\nports (1\u201331), so a path address byte is always in the range\n0\u201331.\n\nLogical addressing uses the remaining values (32\u2013255) of\nthe leading byte of a packet as an index into a routing table.\nEach node on the network is given a unique logical address\nin this range. To send a packet to a node using logical\naddressing, the destination address of the packet contains\none byte which is set to the logical address of the destination\nnode. When the packet arrives at a router the router recog-\nnises that the leading byte is a logical address because it is in\nthe range 32\u2013255. It reads the value of the logical address\nand uses it to look up the output port number that it should\nforward the packet through to send it towards its destination.\nEach router has a routing table programmed with an entry for\neach logical address to indicate the output port that the\npacket should be forwarded through. In the case of logical\naddressing the first address character is not deleted after it\nhas been used by the router, but is left at the front of the\npacket so that it can be used again at the next router.\n\nA path address determines the path that a packet will\ntake through the network, with an explicit instruction about\nwhich way to go for each router on that path. A logical\naddress specifies the destination that the packet is intended\nfor, and it is up to the routers with their routing tables to sort\nout which output port to send the packet through.\n\n15.5.3.6 Example SpaceWire Architecture\nAn example SpaceWire architecture is shown in Fig. 15.17,\nfor a typical payload data system. It uses two SpaceWire\nrouters to provide the interconnectivity between instru-\nments, memory, and processing modules.\n\nInstrument 1 uses a SpaceWire point-to-point link to\nstream data directly into the mass memory module. If the\ndata rate of the instrument is greater than that of a single\nSpaceWire link, two or more links may be used in parallel.\n\nInstrument 2 is connected to the mass memory module\nvia router 1. This configuration allows it to send data to\nother units like the data processor/compressor, and to\nreceive commands from the control processor.\n\nInstrument 3 does not have a SpaceWire interface so an\ninput/output (I/O) module is used to connect the instrument\ninto the SpaceWire network.\n\nInstrument 4 is a complex instrument containing a\nnumber of sub-modules which are interconnected using the\nCAN bus. A remote terminal controller (RTC) is used to\nbridge between the CAN bus and SpaceWire.\n\nInstruments 5, 6 and 7 are located in a remote part of the\nspacecraft. To avoid having three SpaceWire cables running\nto this remote location a second router (SpaceWire Router 2)\nis used to concentrate the information from these three\ninstruments and to then connect to the main router.\n\nThis mass memory module can receive data from any of\nthe instruments either directly, as is the case for Instrument 1,\nor indirectly via Router 1. Data stored in the mass memory\n\nFig. 15.17 Example SpaceWire\narchitecture\n\n464 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\nmodule can be sent to the telemetry formatter/encryption\nmodule for sending to Earth, or it may first be sent to a data\nprocessing or data compression unit. This unit may return the\nprocessed/compressed data to the mass memory module or\nsend it straight to the telemetry module via Router 1.\n\nThe control processor is able to control all the Instru-\nments, mass memory module and telemetry units via the\nSpaceWire network. It can configure, control and read\nhousekeeping and status information from them.\n\nIn Fig. 15.17 redundancy has been eschewed for clarity.\nIn a space flight application, an additional pair of routers\nwould be included with duplicate links to the modules to\nprovide redundancy. It is straightforward to support tradi-\ntional cross-strapped, redundant modules using SpaceWire.\n\n15.5.3.7 SpaceWire Time Codes\nSpaceWire time codes [28] provide a means of sending time\nor synchronization information across a SpaceWire system.\nTime information can be provided as \u2018ticks\u2019 or as an\nincrementing value which may be synchronised to space-\ncraft time. The time codes are broadcast rapidly over the\nSpaceWire network, alleviating the possible need for a\nseparate time distribution network. A time code contains an\n8-bit value, 2 bits of which are flags set to 0b00 and the\nremaining 6 bits are incremented each time a new time code\nis broadcast. When a time code is received in a node or a\nrouter its value is checked against a local time code counter.\nIf the incoming time-code is one more than the value of the\ntime code counter, it is accepted and passed on to the\napplication. In the case of a router, accepted time codes are\nforwarded out through all active links of the router except\nthe one from which the time code originated. If the incoming\ntime code is not one more than the value in the local time-\ncode counter, it is rejected. Whether the incoming time code\nis valid or not, its value will be loaded into the local time-\ncode counter after comparison with the counter value. This\nmechanism provides a simple means of broadcasting the\ntime code over a network with arbitrary structure.\n\n15.5.3.8 SpaceWire Remote Memory Access\nProtocol\n\nA simple, but powerful packet structure allows SpaceWire\nto carry other protocols and be used for many different\napplications. A set of protocols that run over SpaceWire\n\nhave been devised to support some specific needs spacecraft\non-board communications.\n\nTo carry a set of protocols over SpaceWire it is neces-\nsary to be able to distinguish one protocol from another.\nThis is done using a specific packet format which contains a\nprotocol identifier, as illustrated in Fig. 15.18.\n\nThe protocol identifier is a single data character which\nidentifies the specific protocol being carried by the Space-\nWire packet. When logical addressing is being used the\nprotocol identifier follows the logical address. When path\naddressing is being used a dummy logical address is added\nfollowing the path address characters, and the protocol\nidentifier follows that dummy logical address. The dummy\nlogical address can be an actual logical address of a desti-\nnation node or the default logical address of 254. The path\naddress bytes are stripped off as the packet travels through\nthe network, exposing the dummy logical address and\nprotocol identifier in the same positions as when logical\naddressing is being used. This allows the position of the\nprotocol identifier to be determined regardless of which\naddressing mode is being used.\n\nOne of the protocols that have been standardized by\nECSS is the SpaceWire remote memory access protocol\n(RMAP) [30].\n\nThe RMAP provides a common mechanism for reading\nand writing to registers and memory in a remote device over\na SpaceWire network. It can be used to configure devices,\nread housekeeping information, read data from an instru-\nment or mass memory, and write data into a mass memory\nfrom an instrument. Together RMAP and SpaceWire pro-\nvide a powerful combination for spacecraft instrument data-\nhandling. A central payload processing computer is able to\nconfigure the instruments using RMAP. When data is\navailable it can be read from the instrument using an RMAP\nread command. A uniform memory space can be provided\nfor each instrument with pages for instrument data, con-\nfiguration registers and housekeeping status registers, sim-\nplifying and standardizing instrument control operations.\n\nFigure 15.19 shows an RMAP write command being\nsent when logical addressing is being used. The node that is\nsending the command is referred to as the initiator, and the\nnode receiving the command is the target. The RMAP\ncommand begins with the logical address of the target node\nfollowed by the protocol identifier, which is 1 for RMAP.\n\nFig. 15.18 SpaceWire protocol\nidentifier\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 465\n\n\n\nThe next data character is the RMAP instruction, which\nis detailed in Fig. 15.19. This data character indicates\nwhether the RMAP packet is a command or a reply, the type\nof the command (write, read, or read-modify-write), whe-\nther for a write command the data is to be verified before it\nis written, if a reply is required, and if the address being\nwritten is to be incremented as data is written to it. The\nreply address length is used when RMAP is being sent with\npath addresses.\n\nThe key is a data character whose value has to be agreed\nbetween initiator and target for the command to be accep-\nted. The initiator logical address is the logical address of the\ninitiator and used when sending a reply.\n\nThe transaction identifier is a 16-bit field that is normally\nincremented each time an RMAP command is sent out by\nthe initiator. Its value is included in the reply and allows the\ninitiator to associate the reply that it receives with the\ncommand that caused the reply.\n\nThe extended address and address fields for a 40-bit\naddress which specifies where the data in the write com-\nmand is to be written. This may be either a physical or\nvirtual address.\n\nThe data length specifies the amount of data included in\nthe write command.\n\nThe header CRC is used to check that the header does\nnot contain any errors before it is acted upon. The target\nnode will also check that the various fields in the header are\nacceptable before it authorizes the write operation. For\nexample, it may reject commands from initiators that ought\nnot to be writing data to it, or it may reject attempts to write\nto certain areas of memory.\n\nThe data field contains the data to be written to memory\nin the target node.\n\nThe data CRC is used to validate that the data written did\nnot contain any errors. For small amounts of data it is\npossible to buffer it and check it using the data CRC, before\nit is written into memory. This is requested by setting the\n\nverify data bit in the instruction field of the RMAP com-\nmand. Otherwise, data will be written directly into memory\nand the data CRC used to indicate whether there were any\nerrors.\n\nRMAP supports write, read, and read-modify-write\ncommands, and also allows commands to be posted, i.e.\nmany commands to be sent without waiting for a reply to be\nreceived before sending the next command.\n\nRMAP is currently being used in several European,\nAmerican, and Japanese spacecraft.\n\n15.6 Recent On-Board Data Storage\nTechnologies\n\nThe technology used for storage of large amounts of data\non-board spacecraft has varied over the years. Tape\nrecorders were the natural choice in the early days despite\ntheir relatively low reliability, where many failures were\ndue to malfunctions of the mechanical tape transport. Tape\nrecorder data management was also problematic, as a\nplayback operation had to be preceded by a rewind or the\ndata had to be replayed backwards. The tape recorder\nplayback mechanisms even affected early telemetry proto-\ncol standardization [31]. Since the 1990s the tape recorders\nhave been superseded by solid-state recorders (SSR) in\nalmost all applications. Over the years, there have also been\nattempts to employ other mass storage technologies like\nmagnetic bubble memories and hard disks, but with limited\nsuccess.\n\nThe early SSRs were based on dynamic random access\nmemory (DRAM) technology and had capacities of the\norder of one Gbit. DRAM technology is by its nature vol-\natile. A DRAM memory needs continuous refreshing in\norder not to lose data. This is done by regularly recharging\nits internal memory cells consisting of small capacitors.\nConsequently, if power is lost the memory content is lost.\n\nFig. 15.19 SpaceWire RMAP\nwrite command format\n\n466 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\nSSRs are currently dominated by three memory tech-\nnologies, SDRAM, DDRAM, and Flash.\n\n15.6.1 Single Data Rate Memories\n\nThe first technology is single data rate (SDR) synchronous\nDRAM (SDRAM). The technology is known from Pen-\ntium4-based PCs where the memory modules were called\n\u2018PC-100\u2019 or \u2018PC-133\u2019, the number being the clock rate used\nfor communication with the memories. There were several\nversions of the SDR SDRAMs that were suitable for space\napplications, and the space industry has acquired a signifi-\ncant stock that is still used when producing new units of\nexisting designs. The production of these memories has now\nceased, and for new designs other memory types are used.\nThe SDR technology produced memory chips that had a\nmaximum size of 512 Mibits (where 1 Mibit = 220 bits),\ntypically arranged as 128 M 9 4 bits or 64 M 9 8 bits.\n\nThe main problems to solve when using SDR memories\nin space applications are\n\u2022 Tolerance to multiple bit upsets due to single event\n\neffects (SEE). An ion that hits a memory chip may\nchange multiple bits of the chip. The multiple bits may\naffect a single word or multiple words depending on the\nchip architecture. The solution to the problem is to use an\nerror correcting code that can correct any error that can\nbe present in single chip. The most common method is to\nuse a Reed-Solomon code that has a symbol width equal\nto the size of the memory chips used. If 8-bit wide chips\nare used in a 32-bit wide memory, the typical code to use\nwould be an RS(6,4) code that can correct any byte error\nin a 48-bit memory word. The error coding overhead\nwould for this case be 50 % since 16 bits of additional\ninformation is needed for each 32-bit word in the mass\nmemory.\n\n\u2022 Tolerance to single event functional interrupts (SEFI). An\nion that hits a memory chip may cause the entire chip to\nmalfunction. There are only two ways to solve the\nproblem. The first method is to power down and re-power\nthe failing chip. Another method is to reinitiate the failing\nchip using the chip specific control commands. In both\ncases the same error correcting code, e.g. an RS(6,4)\ncode, should be sufficient to recover the proper data\nstored.\nThe main advantages of the SDR memories are the rel-\n\natively simple interface in combination with the 3.3 V\npower supply. This allows implementing an SDR memory\nin most ASIC and field programmable gate array (FPGA)\ntechnologies and it also allows designing parallel data buses\nthat can be configured to interface both SDR memories and\nSRAM memories.\n\n15.6.2 Double Data Rate Memories\n\nThe second technology used is double data rate (DDR)\nSDRAMs. The name originates from the fact that DDR\nmemories are capable of transferring data on both the rising\nand the falling edges of the clock, contrary to the SDR\nmemories that transfer data on a single clock edge only.\nDDR memories have seen five commercial generations,\nwhere DDR-3 is now the dominating memory for PC\nmotherboards and DDR-5 is used extensively in modern\nhigh-end graphics boards. Just as for the SDR memories,\nthere are some DDR memories that can be used in space\napplications. The main drawback with various DDR gener-\nations is that they are not compatible with each other. Even if\nboth DDR-2 and DDR-3 memories use both edges of the\nclock, they differ in for instance signaling voltage levels,\ntiming, and pre-fetch buffer size. The DDR-3 chips are\navailable with a maximum size of 1,024 Mibit, while DDR-\n5 chips are available with a maximum size of 2,048 Mibit.\n\nAll SDRAM memories are accessed in burst mode,\nwhere the maximum burst length varies between the gen-\nerations. Burst accessing means high average data band-\nwidth but with an increased delay, called latency, from\ninitiating the access to the data becoming available. To\noperate efficiently with general purpose processors, it is\nnecessary that the processor have a cache memory whose\nline size matches the memory burst size. Efficient operation\nin mass memory applications is easier, since the data access\nis, by its nature, more sequential compared to operating\nwith a processor. However, there must be some data buf-\nfering in the memory module interface in order to handle\nthe burst accesses, and to handle the memory refresh and\nmemory scrubbing operations that take place at regular\nintervals.\n\nThe DDR memories have the same error behavior as the\nSDR memories, i.e. multiple bit errors or SEFI errors may\noccur as the result of a single ion hitting the chip.\n\n15.6.3 Flash Memories\n\nThe main disadvantage of today\u2019s SDRAM devices is the\nlimited storage capability compared to the third technology\nused in spacecraft mass memories, the Flash memory. The\nFlash memory technology is non-volatile, meaning that the\nmemories keep their content even if powered off. There are\nNOR and NAND types, and they differ in the way they are\naccessed. NOR Flash memories can be accessed by random\naddresses and are typically used to store program code for\nprocessors. NAND Flash memories are accessed sequen-\ntially and are typically used as mass data storage devices in\nUSB sticks, cameras, and solid-state drives. Commercial\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 467\n\n\n\nNAND Flash memory technology is today at 64+ Gbit per\nmemory chip. This is a factor of 32 better than the DDR-5\ntechnology, and consequently NAND Flash memory tech-\nnology is better when implementing large mass memories.\nNOR Flash memories have lower densities and are today at\nsizes similar to SDR memories. Thus, the NOR flash\nmemories have gained less interest in space applications.\n\nNAND Flash memories are arranged in pages and blocks.\nA typical page size is 4,096 ? 128 bytes and a typical block\nconsists of 128 pages. Accesses must be done page by page\nand a page can only be written if the block that it belongs to\nhas been erased since the page was last written.\n\nThe main limitation with the current NAND Flash\nmemories is the access bandwidth. A typical memory chip\nof 8 bits can be written with a rate of up to 40 Mbytes per\nsecond but when one page is written a programming cycle\nmust take place. The programming cycle typically lasts ten\ntimes longer than the page writing time and during the\nprogramming the chip is basically unavailable for other\naccesses. Thus, the programming cycle effectively limits the\ninput data rate to about 4 Mbytes per second. The main way\nto handle the writing limitations is to write several memory\nchips in parallel. During the programming of one chip it is\npossible to write to several other chips in parallel, and the\nprogramming cycles of the different chips can be staggered\nsuch that one chip is always available for writing.\n\nThe second constraint is a limited number of erase and\nprogramming cycles. A block can only be erased about\n100,000 times and may require that some mechanism be\nimplemented to ensure that the limit is not exceeded over\nthe mission lifetime.\n\nThe third limitation is that the memory chips may con-\ntain faults when delivered from the supplier. These faults\nare marked at chip delivery, and the user must create and\nmaintain a bad block list per chip somewhere in his system.\nThe main failure mode during operation is that individual\nbits may fail and the bad block list must then be updated to\nprevent that faulty block from being used.\n\nFailing bits can be corrected at read-out by applying\nvarious error correction schemes. All error correction\nschemes need extra information bits, and this has already\nbeen foreseen in the NAND Flash chips where each page\nhas sufficient extra bytes to store the error correcting code.\nFlash chip manufacturer publish suitable algorithms to use\nfor their products.\n\n15.7 Future On-Board Data Systems\nTechnologies\n\nThis section presents the state at the time of writing. Since\nresearch and technology is moving fast, some information\nmay be obsolete or changed at the time of reading.\n\n15.7.1 Multi-Core CPUs\n\nCommercial processors today are more and more based on\nthe use of several CPU cores embedded in a single chip.\nDual core processors for space applications are announced\nby Aeroflex Gaisler (GR712RC) and Space Micro (Pro-\nton400k-L). The Aeroflex Gaisler solution uses a dual\nLEON3 and is implemented on a 0.18 l process with the\nCPU running at up to 125 MHz. The Space Micro solution\nuses a dual PowerPC e500 and is implemented in a 45 nm\nSilicon-On-Insulator (SOI) process with the CPU running\nbetween 800 MHz and 1.2 GHz. The Space Micro solution\nexploits commercial technology like the Maxwell solution\ndescribed in Sect. 15.4.2 but uses a different concept to\nachieve the desired SEU tolerance. While the Maxwell\nsolution uses three parallel operating processors and\nmajority voting, the Space Micro solution uses a single\nprocessor and compares multiple serial execution sequences.\nA special technique has been developed that exploits the fact\nthat modern processors may have individually controllable\nparallel execution units whose results can be compared. At\nleast two execution sequences are necessary to determine\nwhether an error has occurred, and by executing a third\nsequence it is possible to determine the correct result.\n\nA quad core microprocessor called Next Generation\nMicroprocessor (NGMP) is being developed under an ESA\ncontract [32]. It is based on four LEON4-FT CPUs and\nincludes a PCI port and a number of fast serial links. The\ntarget manufacturing process is a deep submicron technol-\nogy that, depending on the final technology chosen, would\nallow CPU operation at up to 400 MHz.\n\n15.7.2 SpaceFibre\n\nSeveral instruments, including synthetic aperture radar and\nmultispectral imagers, require higher data rates to the mass\nmemory unit than can be provided by SpaceWire. Downlink\ntelemetry systems are being designed that can support Gbit/\ns data transfer rates leading to the need for similar data rates\nto transfer the data from the mass memory unit. There is a\ngrowing requirement for a data communications link with\nan order of magnitude higher performance than SpaceWire,\nwhich can be implemented in radiation tolerant, space-\nqualified technologies.\n\nSpaceFibre is a very high-speed serial communications\nlink which is being designed for use on spacecraft [33].\nA SpaceFibre link connects high data rate payloads into the\non-board data handling system and is able to interoperate\nwith a SpaceWire network. A SpaceFibre link can operate\nover a copper or fibre-optic communications medium and\nsupport real data rates of more than 2 Gbit/s, an improve-\nment over SpaceWire of at least a factor of 10.\n\n468 T. Hult and S. Parkes\n\n\n\nSpaceFibre sends and receives SpaceWire packets and is\nable to send many SpaceWire packets at the same time over\na single SpaceFibre link using virtual channels. Each\nSpaceWire packet is split up into small frames to send over\nthe link, so that information from many virtual channels can\nbe multiplexed over the link. A medium access controller\ndetermines which output virtual channel buffer (VCB) is\nallowed to send data over the SpaceFibre link. SpaceFibre\nprovides several quality of service levels\n\u2022 Priority, where the virtual channel with the highest pri-\n\nority sends the next frame.\n\u2022 Bandwidth reserved, where the virtual channel with\n\nallocated bandwidth and recent low utilisation of the link\nsends the next frame.\n\n\u2022 Scheduled, where virtual channels are allocated specific\ntime-slots in which to send frames.\nSpaceFibre virtual channels provide the capability for\n\nhigh data-rate communications on-board a spacecraft, with\na quality of service suitable for many spacecraft data-han-\ndling applications. SpaceFibre also has a low latency mes-\nsage broadcasting mechanism which can be used to\ndistribute time, signal events, and send other short messages\nover the SpaceFibre network (Fig. 5.20).\n\n15.7.3 Other Future Developments\n\nSeveral terrestrial technologies are likely to have a signifi-\ncant impact on spacecraft on-board processing and data-\nhandling in future.\n\nSystem-on-chip technology is already being used in\nspacecraft applications resulting in substantial reductions in\nthe mass, size, and power consumption of data system\ncomputers. The mass and power of the pure computer part\nwas reduced, by the order of, a factor of two in the first\ndecade of the 21st century. This trend in system-on-chip\nintegration is likely to continue and result in standard pro-\ncessing chips that integrate much of the on-board process-\ning functionality in a single device, including processors,\nmemory, interfaces, and combined with FPGAs for hard-\nware customisation. However, evolution in other technol-\nogy areas such as power converters, communication links\nand packaging technology is required to achieve significant\nfurther mass and power reductions.\n\nReconfigurable FPGA technology offers the potential for\nhigh-speed data processing, which can be reconfigured to\nperform different processing functions at different stages of a\nmission or for different instruments. Wireless communication\n\nFig. 15.20 SpaceFibre CODEC\narchitecture overview\n\n15 On-Board Data Systems 469\n\n\n\ntechnology offers significant potential for mass reduction by\nremoving the need for data network cabling.\n\nTechnology spin-in from terrestrial applications is likely\nto spur on the development of spacecraft on-board data-\nhandling systems to enable higher data-rate instruments to\nbe supported with more demanding processing, compres-\nsion, and data storage requirements. At the same time,\ntechnologies developed for spacecraft applications with\ntheir particular requirements for reliability and simplicity\nare being spun-out into niche terrestrial applications.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Early spacecraft either relied heavily on\nuser commands from the ground or preprogrammed sequences\nto complete their objectives. As missions became more com-\nplex and computing hardware became smaller and more\nmanageable, mission designers moved functionality from the\nground systems to the flight computers. Early spacecraft\ncomputers were particularly resource constrained, requiring\nsoftware developers to be heavily focused on full use of the\nlimited capabilities of early central processing units (CPU). As\nflight computer hardware has advanced, so has software, to the\nextent that it is now an integral part of spacecraft systems.\n\n16.1 Spacecraft Flight Software\nHistory/Evolution\n\n16.1.1 Computing for Human-Rated\nSpacecraft\n\nA review of National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA) human space flight computing provides an example\nof the general evolution of software in this area. On-board\ncomputing was first used in the 1960s. On the Gemini mis-\nsions, software used assembly language, which closely mat-\nches the machine code used to execute computer instructions,\nto develop software to perform various spacecraft activities.\nFor the Apollo program, NASA funded development of the\n\nApollo guidance computer (AGC) [1]. As with the Gemini\ncomputer, software developers used assembly language to\ncreate programs for the AGC. However, the AGC provided an\nadditional programming capability called the Interpreter.\nInstead of relying solely on assembly, developers wrote\nsoftware in a higher-level language that enabled more com-\nplex calculations. Although the programs ran slower than\nthose written strictly in assembly, the interpreted code was\nless prone to errors and allowed for more extensive review\nand analysis. The AGC also used a real-time operating system\n(RTOS) to control the priority and scheduling of execution of\nits programs. Although greatly simplified compared to\nmodern RTOSs, the AGC\u2019s operating system, called the\nExecutive, enabled up to eight applications to run on\nthe spacecraft at any given time. With the completion of the\nApollo program, NASA again tasked IBM to develop the\ncomputing architecture for the Space Shuttle. Unlike Apollo\nand Gemini, the Shuttle computers were general purpose and\nused a higher-level language called High-order Assembly\nLanguage/Shuttle (HAL/S).\n\n16.1.2 Computing for Robotic Spacecraft\n\nAs with human-rated spacecraft, on-board computing for\nrobotic spacecraft began in the 1960s. NASA\u2019s early Moon\nmissions, Ranger and Surveyor, used sequencers with a pre-\ndefined set of instructions to account for all operations on a\ngiven mission, along with the ability to activate sequences\nupon command [2]. The Mariner 6 and 7 probes to Mars,\ndeveloped by the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and laun-\nched in 1969, saw the first capability to program a spacecraft\nduring a mission. In Europe, the first mission to be controlled\nby software was the European X-ray Observatory Satellite\n(Exosat) Earth observation satellite, which was launched in\n1983. As with early human spacecraft, engineers wrote the\nflight software for these spacecraft in assembly language.\n\nC. Krupiarz (&) ? A. Mirantes ? D. Reid ? A. Hill\nEmbedded Applications Group Space Department, The Johns\nHopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD,\nUSA\ne-mail: Christopher.Krupiarz@jhuapl.edu\n\nR. Ward\nSciSys Ltd., Bristol, England\n\nM. Macdonald and V. Badescu (eds.), The International Handbook\nof Space Technology, Springer Praxis Books, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_16,\n? Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014\n\n471\n\n\n\nAs the complexity of deep-space missions increased, so\ndid the computing power and capability. Deep-space probes\nled the way in the development of autonomous software\nbecause mission constraints required the spacecraft to make\ncritical decisions at distances that made real-time human\nintervention impossible. Autonomous fault protection soft-\nware was particularly important to ensure the safety of the\nspacecraft by responding to failures. This area grew in\ncapability and complexity from the two Voyager spacecraft\non through Galileo, Magellan, and Cassini. Galileo was the\nfirst deep-space probe to use the HAL/S programming\nlanguage. As on-board spacecraft flight computers and\nmicroprocessors became faster and provided much greater\nmemory storage, spacecraft flight software grew to fill the\nmemory and to provide greater capabilities. Additionally,\nsoftware engineers began to develop programs in standard\nhigher-level languages such as Ada, C, and C++, thus\nmatching the need for more complex software.\n\nAlthough software engineers currently typically hand-\ncode software, the emerging generation of flight software\nsees more auto-generated code, thus enabling developers to\nfocus on a higher-level abstraction. This is already seen in\nareas such as guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C)\nwhere flight algorithms are generated with off-the-shelf tools.\nThe next step is to apply these techniques to non-GN&C\nsoftware as well.\n\n16.2 Where is Flight Software Used?\n\nIn a modern spacecraft, software is an integral element of\nmany spacecraft subsystems. On the main computer, soft-\nware is generally categorized into three groups: (1) boot, (2)\ncommand and data handling (C&DH) and (3) GN&C.1 In\naddition, software can be found in subsystems such as\npower and communication.\n\n16.2.1 Boot\n\nSpacecraft flight software typically runs on a single board\ncomputer (SBC) with a processor, on-board hardware, and\nperipherals. The boot software configures the SBC to run\nthe application software. This includes initializing registers\non the processor, preparing memory, and configuration of\nthe peripheral devices.\n\n16.2.2 Command and Data Handling\n\nThe C&DH subsystem controls the flow of data through the\nspacecraft. C&DH provides input to the spacecraft via\ncommand processing and output in the form of telemetry\nframes for mission operations personnel. The C&DH soft-\nware also handles routing of data to various other subsys-\ntems either internal to the spacecraft computer or externally\nvia a hardware communications bus. Other software func-\ntionality in the C&DH subsystem can include recording\ndata to and playing data back from a solid-state recorder\n(SSR), performing fault management operations to ensure\nthe health and safety of the spacecraft, and compressing\ndata to reduce downlink bandwidth.\n\n16.2.3 Guidance, Navigation, and Control\n\nThe primary functions of the GN&C subsystems are to\nmaintain spacecraft attitude, to execute propulsive maneu-\nvers for spacecraft trajectory control, and to provide a nav-\nigation function that maintains positional knowledge within\na given frame of reference. Because GN&C is a control\nsystem, the execution of the GN&C software algorithms is\ntightly controlled. As such, they are usually executed at a\nfixed and known rate. Typical execution rates include 20 Hz\nfor control and 1 Hz for guidance and navigation, which is\ncorrespondingly synchronized to mission elapsed time\n(MET), coordinated universal time (UTC), or some other\ntime standard. The software ingests data from the GN&C\nsensors through coordination with the C&DH subsystem,\nruns the data through either hand-coded or auto-generated\nmodels, and outputs actions destined for actuators. As dis-\ncussed in Chap. 12, typical GN&C hardware sensors and the\ncorresponding rates include 100-Hz inertial measurement\nunits (IMU), 10-Hz star trackers (ST), and 1-Hz Sun sensors\n(SS). Typical actuators include 20-Hz reaction wheels, 5-Hz\nmagnetotorquer rods, and 20-Hz attitude control thrusters.\n\n16.2.4 Payload Software\n\nA standard spacecraft configuration consists of a spacecraft\nbus plus one or more payloads or instruments. Generally,\ninstruments have a dedicated processor, with the flight\nsoftware on this processor integrated into the overall\narchitecture of the instrument, payload, or subsystem; the\nprocessor is responsible for operating the instrument as well\nas receiving and transmitting data from and to the main\nspacecraft computer. As instruments become more sophis-\nticated, the complexity of this software is also rapidly\nincreasing and can include significant data processing to\nreduce the amount of data to be downloaded.\n\n1 The definitions of these terms can vary from organization to\norganization or between application environments. For instance, for\nUnited States Department of Defense missions, telemetry, tracking,\nand command (TT&C) is used in place of C&DH.\n\n472 C. Krupiarz et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_12\n\n\n16.2.5 Other Subsystems\n\nAlthough the C&DH, GN&C, and payload constitute most\nof the software on a spacecraft, software is found in other\nsubsystems as well. For example, a power system may\ncontain software to control the rate of charge, a transceiver\nmay contain software to regulate the operation and data link\nrates of the communications system, and a fault protection\nmodule may monitor various aspects of a spacecraft to\nensure proper health and safety of the vehicle.\n\n16.3 Relationship with Spacecraft\nHardware\n\n16.3.1 Impact of Hardware on Software\n\nLike typical embedded systems, flight software is tightly\ncoupled with the hardware and interfaces on a spacecraft.\nFor software on the main processor (MP), hardware\ndependencies fall into three broad categories: (1) on-card,\n(2) in-chassis, and (3) external interfaces.\n\n16.3.1.1 On-Card\nThe spacecraft processor is located on an SBC. The SBC can\ninclude just the processor or other interfaces such as an SSR\nor other peripherals. As discussed in Chap. 15, processors for\nspacecraft are designed to withstand the rigors of the space\nenvironment, including high radiation, extreme temperatures,\nlower power, high g-forces, and vibration of launch. The\ndifficult space environment combined with the long lead--\ntimes to space-qualify a processor results in the terrestrial\ncomputing community significantly outpacing that of space.\nFor example, whereas a typical desktop operates with clock\nspeeds in the gigahertz range, a spacecraft computer operates\nin the megahertz range.2 These hardware limitations also\nlimit software performance, and require constant assessment\nof software performance in order to guarantee that the soft-\nware meets timing constraints. Early in the mission, the\nsystem and software engineers should conduct a significant\ntrade or evaluation to ensure that the system\u2019s architecture\ncan support the processing, memory, and timing requirements\nplus an additional margin levied on the processor.\n\n16.3.1.2 In-Chassis Communications\nAlong with the processor SBC, spacecraft computers can\ncontain multiple other hardware cards to perform\n\nfunctionality, such as uplink/downlink, spacecraft interface\ncommunications, and hardware storage. The MP commu-\nnicates with these hardware devices via a backplane such as\nCompactPCI or VMEbus. One typical card is the solid-state\nrecorder that contains banks of memory. It is located either\non a local hardware bus or externally to the spacecraft\ncomputer. Historically, data recorders were tape drives.\nThis technology has now transitioned to hardware similar to\nthat found in thumb drives. SSRs contain either volatile\nmemory (typically synchronous dynamic random-access\nmemory, SDRAM) or nonvolatile memory (such as Flash or\nelectronically erasable programmable read-only memory,\nEEPROM). Volatile memory does not retain data when\npower is removed from the SSR, whereas non-volatile\nmemory does. The flight software interacts with SSRs by\nstoring data either in a file system or in a custom format and\nthen retrieving and transmitting data to the ground upon\nrequest. Further information can be found in Chap. 15.\n\n16.3.1.3 External Interfaces\nThe primary spacecraft computer typically contains only the\nhardware necessary to perform spacecraft control and data\ncollection. As a result, it requires interfaces to external\ncomponents. These components can range from instruments\nto GN&C sensors to communication systems. The hardware\ninterfaces are dependent on spacecraft design constraints\nsuch as mass, power, and electromagnetic interference, and\nare point-to-point interfaces or bus architectures. Point-to-\npoint interfaces include standard serial communications\nprotocols such as RS-232, RS-422, RS-485, and low voltage\ndifferential signaling (LVDS). These interfaces provide\ndirect links to components that are not shared. Bus archi-\ntectures such as MIL-STD-1553B CAN Bus and SpaceWire\nprovide a single input into the MP, with multiple nodes\nsharing the communications link.\n\n16.4 Flight Software Development\nProcesses\n\nFlight software is a critical subsystem element and must be\nhighly reliable. To achieve this, flight software engineers\nfollow a rigorous software development process to ensure\nsuccess. Organizations that develop software have unique\nguidelines, but they all have the same goal of fault-free\nsoftware and follow the general model described here.3\n\n2 Measuring the relative performance of processors cannot be done by\nstrictly comparing clock speeds. Multiple factors such as the\ninstruction set, caching, and floating-point capability can influence\nperformance. Although there is no absolute method for comparison,\nsynthetic benchmark programs such as Dhrystone, Whetstone, and\nCoreMark can provide acceptable indications of performance.\n\n3 Software development is driven by multiple documents from\nNASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the U.S. Department\nof Defense (DoD). These include ESA\u2019s ECSS-E-40, DoD Standard\nDOD-STD-2167A, NASA Procedural Requirements 7,150.2, and\nGoddard Procedural Requirements 1,000.\n\n16 Flight Software 473\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_15\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_15\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_15\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_15\n\n\n16.4.1 Development Methodology\n\nThe development of software follows an ordered series of\nactivities, or methodology. Although the activities are com-\nmon to most software development projects, there tends to be\nvariation in order, scope, and level of detail. These deviations\nare related to the criticality of the software, the amount of\ninformation available before beginning development, and the\ninternal processes of the developing organization.\n\n16.4.1.1 Predictive Models\nThe most common development methodologies in use for\nspacecraft flight software are predictive models. These\nmodels focus on detailed planning. They include Waterfall,\nCompressed Waterfall, and Incremental Build.\n\nThe Waterfall model (Fig. 16.1) describes the develop-\nment as a single sequence of activities, each building on the\npreceding activity and culminating in the final product.\nSome overlap is expected from one activity to the next;\nhowever, activities are formally defined, usually occur only\nonce, and culminate in a single product meeting most, if not\nall, of the original requirements. The Waterfall model is\nshown as a linear set of steps flowing from one to the other,\nlike a waterfall. In a Waterfall model, each step can impact\nthe previous step, with information attained circling back up\nthe waterfall. For instance, a test case may reveal that a\nrequirement was incorrect, and so that information will be\nfed back to the requirements phase. Generally, the farther\ndown the waterfall that an error is discovered, the more\ncostly it is to repair.\n\nThe Compressed Waterfall model is the same as the\nWaterfall model except that the detailed design and\n\nimplementation steps occur iteratively, beginning with\nhigh-risk or highly constrained elements before adding the\nremaining elements to complete the product. Development\nteams typically adopt the Compressed Waterfall model\nwhen most requirements are known in advance but some\nrisk reduction is required early in the cycle.\n\nThe Incremental Build model selects subsets of the\nsoftware requirements to be delivered as a series of prod-\nucts, or \u2018builds\u2019. Software teams use the Incremental Build\nmodel when most, but not all of the requirements are\nknown, but there is either a need for early delivery of a\npartial set of requirements or an unpredictable budget or\nschedule.\n\n16.4.1.2 Adaptive Models\nAdaptive models can also be used in the development of\nspacecraft software. However, these are usually used only\nwhen the software is less critical or on smaller projects.\nThese models focus on adapting quickly to changing pro-\ngram needs. They include Spiral and Agile.\n\nThe Spiral model iterates through all of the development\nactivities many times, with each iteration resulting in a new\nproduct. Requirements are not completely known at the start\nof this process and are discovered as part of every iteration.\nAs a result, the requirements and design can be refined each\ntime through the cycle of activities. This model is used\nwhen the requirements are vague or ill-defined, and a pro-\ncess is needed to adapt to this.\n\nAgile software development encompasses a number of\ndifferent methodologies where the software development\nprocess must adapt quickly to change and requirements are\nnot well understood at the outset. Most Agile methods are\n\nFig. 16.1 The waterfall model\nprovides incremental\ndevelopment that feeds back\nthrough the process\n\n474 C. Krupiarz et al.\n\n\n\nbased on the following tenets: rapid feedback from the\ncustomer; a simple, informal process; incremental changes;\nand small, usually co-located teams. As with the Spiral\nmodel, software teams use this more for small and less\ncritical projects as opposed to larger subsystems such as\nC&DH and GN&C.\n\n16.5 Flight Software Development Steps\n\nUsing the Waterfall model as a basis, the following delves\ninto details regarding each step of the development process.\nNote that documentation does not have a specific section;\nrather, it is intertwined among the ensuing sections. Each\nphase has a particular set of documents that should be\nrequired in a software development process in order to\nadvance to the next state. All significant documentation\u2014\nfor example, interface control documents (ICD), user\u2019s\nmanuals, and requirements documents\u2014requires sign-off by\nthe various interested parties.\n\n16.5.1 Planning\n\nPlanning provides the basis for development of the soft-\nware. During this phase, the software team or lead identifies\nany areas of potential risk, conducts technology trades, and\ndefines a baseline architecture for the system. In addition,\nbecause there is generally a large codebase at the devel-\nopment organization, the software team identifies what can\nbe reused from previous missions. Reuse can reduce\ndevelopment costs and the requirements process, but care\nshould be taken to ensure that the software being reused fits\nthe functionality of the new mission. Also as part of the\nplanning process, the flight software team identifies what\ntools are going to be used for the various parts of the\nsoftware effort. This includes scheduling software, docu-\nmentation and development tools, configuration manage-\nment (CM) software, and requirements and traceability\ntools. This type of information is typically saved in a\nsoftware development plan.\n\n16.5.2 Requirements\n\nSpacecraft flight software requirements typically begin with\na flow-down of requirements from the mission system and\nspacecraft system requirements. Each system-level\nrequirement is reviewed for flight software application. The\nrequirements should include any software safety require-\nments derived from the system hazard analysis. A unified\nmodeling language (UML) design approach will include\nuse-cases to identify requirements. Additionally, the\n\nconcept of operations document for the mission can provide\ninsight into high-level functional requirements for flight\nsoftware and provide additional use-cases. Once complete,\nthe software development team traces requirements from\nthe mission-level requirement to the flight software\nrequirements.\n\nAfter the project establishes the high-level software\nrequirements, the software team begins the process of\ndeveloping detailed requirements. If previous software is\navailable, the developers examine the reused software\nrequirements. Next, the team determines new requirements\nthrough analysis. This includes emphasizing functionality,\nexternal interfaces, performance, customer/user expecta-\ntions, and design constraints. The software development\nteam can use ICDs, specifications, and other available\nsubsystem documentation to help understand and refine the\nrequirements.\n\nAs part of developing detailed software requirements,\nthe software team creates a context diagram to identify the\ninterfaces and high-level inbound and outbound data flows\nin relation to the single highest-level aggregate of software.\nThe context diagram consists of a circle representing this\nsingle, aggregate software application. Arrows to and from\nthe circle indicate data flow external to the software.\n\nThe software engineers derive requirements from the\nbaseline requirements in sufficient detail to perform the\narchitectural design. The requirements should be stated\nunambiguously; performance requirements should be\nquantified, and requirements should be written so that each\nis testable; see Sect. 7.3 for more on this. It is expected that\nthe requirements will be sufficiently thorough that test\nengineers can understand and evaluate the software built to\nmeet them. However, system designers should take care to\nnot over-specify a system because this may introduce\nunmanageable overheads.\n\nThis activity culminates in the release of a software\nrequirements specification which contains the functional\nand performance requirements that address what the soft-\nware must do. It should clearly identify software safety\nrequirements and include any safety-related constraints\nbetween the system\u2019s hardware and software. The docu-\nment incorporates the context diagram produced during the\nscope-determination activity, and it defines the inputs that\nthis software component must process and the outputs that\nit must produce. It also defines the processing that the\nsoftware must perform. Often the software requirements\nspecification is evaluated at the software requirements\nreview. After the resolution of any action items from\nthat review, the software requirements specification is\nbaselined and signed off by key members of the project\nteam.\n\nIt is also advantageous to involve the test team early in\nthe process. By having testers review requirements with an\n\n16 Flight Software 475\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_7\n\n\neye toward stress testing and testability early, the overall\nproject testing costs can be reduced. In addition, this\nenables early development of the test scripts and\nprocedures.\n\n16.5.3 Design\n\nAfter the flight software requirements are baselined, the\nsoftware development team begins the design process. The\ndesign phase encompasses two major steps of the software\ndevelopment process: (1) the definition of the architectural\ndesign and (2) the subsequent decomposition into a detailed\ndesign.\n\nThe architectural design of flight software addresses the\nstructure of the software and the control relationships\nbetween components. In addressing these issues, the design\nmust also specify the concurrency of the program, timing\nconsiderations for the concurrent components, and the\nrelationships between them. Therefore, the developer of\nflight software must define the tasks, the communications\nmechanisms to be used between tasks, and the scheduling of\nthe tasks. Upon completion of the architectural design, the\nsoftware development team will conduct a preliminary\ndesign review (PDR) which typically involves the following\nmaterials\n\u2022 Software context diagram\n\u2022 Requirements changes since software requirements\n\nreview\n\u2022 Software functional overview\n\u2022 Task communication graph\n\u2022 High-level driving requirements\n\u2022 Data flow diagrams\n\u2022 Text description of the design\n\u2022 General command list\n\u2022 General telemetry list\n\u2022 Processor description including memory capacities and\n\nclock speed\n\u2022 Resource margins\n\u2022 Risks and mitigation strategy\n\u2022 The system safety engineer\u2019s software safety design\n\nanalysis\n\u2022 Developer test approach.\n\nAt this point in the software design, the software accep-\ntance test team will often begin reviewing the requirements\nand planning the software system verification and validation\ntests.\n\nThe final activity in the design phase is the detailed\ndesign. This activity further refines the design captured in\nthe architectural design in greater detail. At the end of this\nactivity, the software development team will have a critical\ndesign review (CDR) involving the following materials\n\n\u2022 Context diagram (defined during requirements specifica-\ntion and updated as needed)\n\n\u2022 ICD summary (list of data provided from/to external\nsources, including commands and telemetry initially\nproduced during requirements specification)\n\n\u2022 Changes since PDR\n\u2022 Task structure charts, flowcharts, or program design\n\nlanguage (PDL)\n\u2022 Software architecture diagram\n\u2022 Method structure charts, flowcharts, or PDL\n\u2022 Software interface definition (C language header files or\n\nequivalent)\n\u2022 Design drivers\n\u2022 Task communication graph (defined during architectural\n\ndesign and updated as needed)\n\u2022 Test approach (unit, integration, system)\n\u2022 Estimates of CPU and memory utilization\n\u2022 Estimates of other hardware utilization\n\u2022 Risks and approach to mitigate each risk\n\u2022 The system safety engineer\u2019s software safety design analysis\n\u2022 Test plan outline.\n\nThe design products are baselined at the review and\nupdated as part of the response to action items.\n\n16.5.3.1 Meeting the Needs of Reviewers\nGiven that both the requirements and design phases require\nthe successful completion of reviews, the software devel-\nopment team must be aware of how to meet the needs of\nreviewers. A successful software review (requirements,\ndesign, etc.) should include at least the following\n\u2022 Review material that conforms to a standard template,\n\ndelivered with sufficient time for reviewers to prepare\n\u2022 References and supporting material\n\u2022 Open issues that are clearly marked as \u2018to be determined\u2019\n\u2022 A glossary of terms\n\u2022 Review agenda with time frames allotted\n\u2022 Reviewer guidelines for the type of review being conducted.\n\n16.5.3.2 Industry Standards\nIn addition to processes unique to an organization, flight\nsoftware development is also governed by industry stan-\ndards for development.\n\nAS9100 is the quality management standard for aero-\nspace. The Society of Automotive Engineers published the\nstandard in 1999, with input from the American Aerospace\nQuality Group (AAQG) and support from the International\nAerospace Quality Group (IAQG) and the Society of British\nAerospace Companies (SBAC). The industry team devel-\noped AS9100 to enhance the ISO 9000 series of standards\nto ensure quality and safety in the high-risk aerospace\nindustry. Specific areas relevant to software that were\nenhanced include\n\n476 C. Krupiarz et al.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Configuration management (CM)\n\u2022 Design, verification, validation, and testing processes\n\u2022 Reliability, maintainability, and safety\n\u2022 Product documentation\n\u2022 Corrective action\n\u2022 Inspection and testing procedures.\n\nCapability maturity model integration (CMMI) is a set of\nbest practices and models that are used to improve an\nexisting process. Most software development organizations\nuse CMMI to take an existing process, such as AS9100 or\nECSS, and improve it by adding practices such as collecting\nand managing requirements, measuring performance, plan-\nning work, and assessing risks.\n\n16.5.4 Implementation\n\n16.5.4.1 Languages\nAs stated previously, on early spacecraft, engineers relied on\neither assembly or custom languages to develop software. As\nthe underlying hardware has progressed to more mainstream\narchitectures, the need for custom languages has diminished.\nHence, software teams predominantly use higher-level lan-\nguages such as C, C++, or Ada. Using these types of well-\nknown languages greatly increases the potential developer\nbase, expands on the wealth of previously developed soft-\nware components and development tools, and enhances the\nreadability and reuse of code as well as overall productivity.\nSoftware engineers do still resort to assembly language for\nlow-level drivers or when necessary to increase the speed of\nexecution for certain aspects of the code.\n\n16.5.4.2 Automatic Code Generation\nAs spacecraft on-board processing resources have\nincreased, the need to optimize code has decreased. As a\nresult, code for GN&C software is increasingly being gen-\nerated automatically from the high-level system specifica-\ntion produced in tools like MATLAB? Simulink and\ndSPACE TargetLink. Such techniques have been used on\nlow-cost missions such as LISA Pathfinder and Proba in\norder to reduce the time necessary to redevelop the software\nin response to late changes in the specification. However,\nuse of this technique can make software verification more\ncomplex because the software engineers must understand\ncode that they have not written.\n\n16.5.4.3 Development Environment/Operating\nSystems\n\nMost modern spacecraft use a real-time operating system\n(RTOS). Responsibilities of the RTOS include managing\nthe various tasks in a system, handling operating system\nconstructs such as semaphores and queues, and interfacing\n\nwith the underlying hardware. A key feature of an RTOS\nversus a non-RTOS is that it enables scheduling and exe-\ncution of tasks with a minimal amount of jitter. An RTOS\nalso provides a well-documented and understood method\nfor handling errors and faults. Although the majority of an\nRTOS can be used from platform to platform, an RTOS\nuses an additional hardware-specific set of software called\nthe board support package (BSP) to adapt to a new hard-\nware domain. A BSP is specific to a particular platform;\ntherefore, it is not reused outside of the specific hardware.\n\n16.5.4.4 Time and Space Partitioning of Software\nSystems\n\nAs software systems become more complex, the integration\nand validation of components of different criticality and\nwith different origins becomes ever more expensive. To\naddress this, the space industry is starting to adopt a tech-\nnique called integrated modular architecture (IMA) that is\nused in the commercial aerospace industry. The technique\nrelies on software/hardware support to provide a number of\npartitions that guarantee isolation of a set of components\nfrom each other. This is to prevent one software component\nfrom corrupting the memory or stealing computer resources\nused by another component. This simplifies development\nand validation because each partition can be developed in\nisolation. The use of time and space partitioning to divide a\ntypical software system is shown in Fig. 16.2.\n\n16.5.4.5 Specific Flight Software/Embedded\nTechniques\n\nEmbedded software, and spacecraft software in particular,\nrequires programming techniques that are different from those\nused in a workstation environment. This is due both to the high-\nreliability requirements of flight software and to the con-\nstrained environment seen on the spacecraft. As such, devel-\nopers follow stringent coding guidelines either created within\nthe organization or externally, such as that developed by the\nMotor Industry Software Reliability Association called the\nMISRA C coding guidelines. Typical recommendations\ninclude avoiding dynamic memory allocations, limiting the use\nof global variables, and refraining from recursive functions.\n\n16.5.4.6 Configuration Management\nConfiguration management (CM) is a method by which\nsoftware code is stored in a common repository. Developers\ncheck out this code to make changes and then commit the\ncode back into the repository. A CM system enables fea-\ntures such as safe storage of the software code, versioning\nof the software, and revision history. Several CM systems\nare available commercially and open-source.\n\nOnly the smallest of software tasks should be performed\nwithout CM, so it follows that flight software is highly\ndependent on CM. This is not only for switching between\n\n16 Flight Software 477\n\n\n\nversions during development but also for delivering soft-\nware to the spacecraft. The software development team\nmust know which versions are used to run each set of tests\nand which are loaded and delivered to mission operations. A\nvaluable addition to this tracking is to include an element in\nthe software that can display date, time, and versioning\ninformation in telemetry.\n\n16.5.4.7 Static Analysis\nIn addition to human review of software, flight software is\nsubjected to static analysis using various tools. These can be\nparticularly helpful in automating code reviews. Instead of\nfocusing on mundane checking of logic (such as inclusion\nof breaks in a switch statement), reviewers can instead study\nmore in depth the functionality of the code.\n\n16.6 Flight Software Development Testing\n\n16.6.1 Testing Philosophy and Approach\n\nGiven the critical nature of flight software, testing has a\nhigh profile in the overall development process. This testing\nis performed not only by the developers but often also by an\nindependent team that answers to an authority outside of the\nnormal program management structure. The tests on both\nsides of this organizational divide are generally defined and\ncreated by referring back to a well-thought-out set of\noperational and performance requirements. The tests need\nto be comprehensive, traceable back to the requirements,\nauditable, and repeatable.\n\n16.6.2 Test Simulators\n\nOne of the most fundamental aspects of flight software\ntesting is the need to perform the testing and validation in\nan environment that is as representative as possible of the\nactual spacecraft. In the absence of the real spacecraft, this\nis often achieved by testing within a so-called hardware-in-\nthe-loop (HIL) configuration that provides realistic models\nof real-world sensors and actuators as well as the corre-\nsponding mathematical models of the spacecraft dynamics\nand environment. A high-fidelity HIL test bed is generally\nrequired; however, as necessary as this might be, it is also\n\nexpensive. The reality of modern-day budgets often means\nthat there are only one or two HIL environments available\nfor the entire spacecraft testing effort. The traditional\nmethod used to mitigate the HIL bottleneck is to develop\nand deploy so-called software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulators\nwith which the sensors and actuators are mathematically\nmodeled along with the spacecraft dynamics and environ-\nment. In a SIL environment, testers can develop scripts and\nprove their test methods before inevitably executing and\nverifying them, once again, in the presumably much higher\nfidelity of the HIL environment. A SIL is normally imple-\nmented in off-the-shelf desktop computers and is therefore\ninexpensive from a hardware cost perspective. It can be\nexpensive from a software perspective because the software\nmust be carefully designed and tested before being released\nfor validation of software of similar complexity.\n\n16.6.3 Testing Steps\n\nThe software and test team perform testing throughout the\ndevelopment process.\n\n16.6.3.1 Unit\nIndividual developers perform unit testing on their specific\nsoftware units. This is done at the procedure/function level\nand includes verification of all paths in the code. Software\nengineers conduct this testing either through manual coding\nor via automated testing software.\n\n16.6.3.2 Application Test\nAs with unit tests, individual developers conduct applica-\ntion testing. Although similar to unit testing, these tests do\nnot focus on specific path testing but instead examine the\nfull functionality of an application. Developers are verifying\nthat the application operates as a full unit and meets the unit\nrequirements.\n\n16.6.3.3 Integration Test\nUpon delivery of the individual applications, the integration\ntester, who can be an individual such as the software lead or the\nentire team, conducts tests over the complete system. This\nagain builds on the incremental nature of testing\u2014from unit to\napplication to system. The integration testing consists of trac-\ning and verifying the requirements of the system as a whole.\n\nFig. 16.2 Partitioning software\nsystems\n\n478 C. Krupiarz et al.\n\n\n\n16.6.3.4 Acceptance Test\nThe acceptance test process has the same goal as integration\ntesting: tracing requirements to tests. However, the accep-\ntance test team is independent of the software team. Hence,\nthe tester\u2019s ability to discover either bugs or requirement\ndiscrepancies is enhanced through a tester seeing the system\nfrom a different viewpoint. Acceptance tests can be either\nscripted, or hand operated. In both cases, testers typically\nuse either a modified or a fully implemented version of the\nground system to operate the system through commanding\nand viewing telemetry.\n\n16.6.3.5 Scenario Test\nScenario testing can be viewed as either a complement to\nacceptance testing or an alternative. With scenario testing, a\ntester may not map specific requirements to a specific test\nbut instead focus on either groups of requirements or use-\ncases of system functionality. For example, instead of ver-\nifying that a specific command increases a specific counter,\na scenario test would involve multiple operations, of which\nthat specific command is just a small part.\n\n16.6.3.6 Stress Test\nAs with scenario testing, a stress test focuses on the larger\nsystem. Instead of verification, however, a stress test\nattempts to break the system by adding high loads, where\npossible. This includes activities such as triggering instru-\nments to send their maximum amount of data, executing the\nfull complement of fault protection algorithms, and\nrecording large amounts of data to the SSR\u2014all at the same\ntime. This stresses the system to determine whether there\nare any failures in timing, operation, or functionality.\n\n16.6.3.7 Operational Testing\nAfter delivery, the flight software team contributes to\nadditional operational testing. These tests include launch\nsimulations, day-in-the-life testing, and off-nominal testing.\n\n16.7 Post-Launch\n\n16.7.1 Software Updates\n\nModern spacecraft rarely exclude the ability for the mission\noperations team to update the software post-launch. As\nsuch, the flight software team needs to include the ability to\nmodify the software during the actual mission. Software\nupdates range across the following from least to most\nintrusive\n\u2022 In-line patch\n\u2022 Jump patch\n\u2022 Image load.\n\nTo conduct an in-line patch, the software team pokes a\nlocation in memory with either a new instruction or a\nmodification to a data element, thus changing the operation\nof the software. Patches that are more complex may entail a\njump patch. With this method, the team modifies the exe-\ncuting code as it operates out of random-access memory\n(RAM) by loading new code into areas of unused RAM and\nthen using assembly language modifications to jump to that\nlocation. The disadvantage of both of these techniques is\nthat they usually require lower-level programming skills,\nthe modification is harder to validate, and the patch is lost\neach time the processor is reset and the stored image is\nreloaded. An alternative to patching is to load a new image\ninto a non-volatile memory location while running the older\nsoftware version out of static random-access memory\n(SRAM). Once the success of the upload has been verified,\nthe operations team sends a command to tell the computer\nto boot from the new image and then resets the spacecraft\ncomputer. Although this provides for consistency in code\nimages and uses the usual tools that made the original\nimage, resetting the spacecraft can be difficult and, for some\nmissions, not cost-effective. Intentionally resetting the\nspacecraft usually requires heavy mission operations\ninvolvement and a significant period to transition back to\noperational mode.\n\n16.7.2 Handling Post-Launch Anomalies\n\nThe most important element in handling post-launch anom-\nalies is for the software team to ensure that it has the data\nneeded to debug issues in flight. This capability begins during\ndesign by including an anomaly or event-logging process\nwithin the software architecture. The event logging includes\nsufficient information to make the anomaly unique and\nidentifiable to a particular application. Also, the software\narchitecture should include the ability to store the most recent\nanomalies in a memory location that the mission operations\nteam can retrieve after a reset. In addition to the event log, the\nsoftware should store information such as the reset cause, the\ntask switch log, and processor stack information.\n\n16.8 Spacecraft Software Architectures\n\nA spacecraft software architecture defines how the various\nsoftware elements within a system operate and communi-\ncate. The architecture is a product of the preliminary and\ncritical design phases of the software development process\nand is essential to producing software that is efficient to\ndevelop, testable, and maintainable. The software team\ndocuments an architecture beginning with an overall top-\nlevel design and continues with each sub-element further\n\n16 Flight Software 479\n\n\n\ndelineated by more detailed designs. The top-level design\nshows how the software is grouped into an overall computer\nsoftware configuration item (CSCI). The sub-elements are\nthe computer software components (CSC).\n\nAs defined by IEEE\u2019s Standard Glossary of Software\nEngineering Terminology, a CSCI is \u2018\u2018an aggregation of\nsoftware that is designated for configuration management\nand treated as a single entity in the configuration man-\nagement process\u2019\u2019 [3]. The flight software architect defines\nthe breadth of a CSCI, and this varies given organizational\nor functional constraints. A CSCI can be broad and typically\nconsists of the software binary code that is loaded into a\ngiven processor on the spacecraft. Depending on the overall\narchitecture, that can include boot, C&DH and GN&C, if\noperating on the same processor, C&DH and GN&C alone\nif each is operating on separate processors, and the various\nsoftware packages that operate on instruments or other\nsubsystem elements. The CSCI can also be more tightly\ndefined by decomposing the larger subsystem into smaller\ntheme-based CSCIs such as commanding, telemetry, and\ninstrument processing. Within each of these CSCIs are\napplications that perform related functionality.\n\nA CSC is defined as \u2018\u2018a functionally or logically distinct\npart of a computer software configuration item, typically an\naggregate of two or more software units.\u2019\u2019 A flight software\narchitect deconstructs the requirements related to the CSCI\ninto a number of CSCs, each of which contains one or more\ntasks to fulfill the corresponding requirements. Defining dis-\ntinct CSCs enables the lead software engineer to cleanly assign\nresponsibilities for the various modules across the team.\n\nOnce the software architect delineates the CSCs, the next\nstep is to determine a method of communication between\nelements. This architecture construction generally falls into\ntwo categories: (1) tightly coupled and (2) decoupled soft-\nware. In a tightly coupled system, there are specific com-\nmunications mechanisms between the various software\nelements. These include direct function calls into their\nrespective CSCs\u2019 code space, message queues contained in\nthe RTOS, or shared memory spaces. Although this is a\nstraightforward solution, a disadvantage of a tightly coupled\narchitecture is that changes can affect multiple CSCs and\nreuse can be difficult because the code is heavily linked\ntogether. With decoupled software, the CSCs stand apart from\none another, with a single direct line of communication in and\nout of the system. A standard architecture for a decoupled\nsystem is based on message passing. In this architecture, a\nsoftware bus routes messages between CSCs. The advantage\nof this architecture is that each CSC can stand alone, and\nrevised CSCs can be dropped in and out of an architecture as\nlong as they conform to the appropriate message interface.\n\nAn example of a decoupled architecture is shown in\nFig. 16.3 and represents most of the main capabilities seen\nin the main computer of a spacecraft, with each bubble\n\nrepresenting a CSC. \u2018Scheduler\u2019 is responsible for initiating\nthe various tasks at predetermined rates. The rates typically\nrange from once per second to tens of times per second.\n\u2018Uplink\u2019 ingests commands and other data from the com-\nmunications system and then distributes those data\nthroughout the system. \u2018Command manager\u2019 controls the\ncommand rate of the system and determines the priority of\ncommands. \u2018Autonomy\u2019 watches over the spacecraft oper-\nation and health and safety and acts when necessary to\nrecover from faults or, if necessary, to save the spacecraft.\n\u2018Time tags\u2019 keep track of spacecraft MET and execute a\nseries of commands when the MET reaches a corresponding\nvalue. \u2018Instrument manager\u2019 controls the flow of commands\nto various instruments and collects science data from these\nsources. \u2018Spacecraft interfaces\u2019 are responsible for collect-\ning sensor data and other non-instrument data from outside\nof the main computer. \u2018GN&C\u2019 controls the attitude,\nthrusters, and other dynamic positional characteristics of the\nvehicle. \u2018Record\u2019 stores both spacecraft and instrument\nhousekeeping data to the SSR. \u2018File manager\u2019 controls file\nsystem operations on the SSR. \u2018SSR playback\u2019 retrieves\ndata from the SSR for transmission to the ground system.\n\u2018Downlink\u2019 manages the output of telemetry from the\nspacecraft. \u2018Memory scrub\u2019 continually reads data from the\nmemories of various computers to enable data correction.\n\u2018CPU performance monitor\u2019 keeps track of how much\nloading the CPU sees on a 1 s basis. The CSCs are layered\non multiple interfaces, including a software message bus,\nthe operating system, the processor hardware, and the\nhardware communication bus.\n\n16.8.1 Boot\n\nBoot enables operation of the single board computer and\nperipherals. The boot software is generally created earlier in\nthe development cycle since all later applications rely on boot\nto provide an operating platform. The boot software can reside\non a \u2018write once\u2019 device such as a programmable read-only\nmemory (PROM) or it can be included a rewritable non-vol-\natile memory location. Since all operation depends on boot,\nsystems developers should take care to minimize complexity\nin the boot process and reduce boot to only the essentials\nneeded to enable operation of the upper layer programs.\n\n16.8.2 Command and Data Handling\n\nNearly all of the applications in the example architecture in\nFig. 16.3 fall into the category of the C&DH subsystem.\nThe primary role of the C&DH subsystem is to ingest\ncommands from the radio frequency (RF) link, record\nhousekeeping and science data, and to return those data in\n\n480 C. Krupiarz et al.\n\n\n\nthe form of telemetry to the ground. Generally, C&DH is\nalso a \u2018catch all\u2019 for other functionality, including auton-\nomy, mission planning, data compression, and image pro-\ncessing\u2014essentially any element of spacecraft software that\ndoes not directory involve GN&C.\n\n16.8.2.1 Commanding\nMultiple sources can generate commands for a C&DH\nsystem, including operators on the ground, other spacecraft,\nother processors, and stored commands. For commands\nreceived through the RF link, command input is relatively\nslow. On a typical robotic spacecraft, the command rates are\nlow, typically ranging up to only 2,000 bps. Hence, a\ncommand ingest application does not require a significant\namount of processing time, and the interrupt rates for\ncommanding to receive new data are relatively low. Com-\nmands received via this route are usually encased in pro-\ntocols defined by the Consultative Committee for Space\nData Systems (CCSDS). These protocols frame and\nencapsulate the data in multiple layers to ensure proper\ntransmission and receipt. Two types of methods are used\nthroughout spacecraft design: (1) telecommands (TC) and\n(2) advanced orbiting service (AOS) [4]. Although older\nthan the AOS protocols, TC is still widely in use today.\nParsing the CCSDS data as they come into the system is\nperformed by either hardware or software. If performed by\nsoftware, the responsible C&DH module peels back the\nprotocol layers until it extracts the commands.\n\nCommand constraints are a critical element in designing\na C&DH system, and they can include\n\u2022 Ordering\u2014some commands are order dependent. For\n\ninstance, the spacecraft may need to slew before an\nimager takes a photo.\n\n\u2022 Command execution time\u2014commands vary in execution\ntime. For example, a command that simply sets a 1-bit\nflag will execute quickly, whereas, a file system operation\nthat may move megabytes of data will take a significantly\nlonger time to operate. The flight software design must\naccommodate the nondeterministic nature of\ncommanding.\n\n\u2022 Failure processing\u2014commands may fail for multiple\nreasons. For example, the command may have been\ncorrupted in non-volatile memory, the state of the system\nmay not have been correct when the command was\nexecuted, or the command may have had incorrect\narguments. Commands are evaluated on an individual\nbasis to determine whether a command failure is critical.\n\n\u2022 Command prioritization\u2014some commands take priority\nover others. Real-time commands from the ground are the\nhighest priority because they allow for preemption of any\ncommands that may be producing critical errors.\n\n\u2022 Time criticality\u2014although some instruments may not\nrequire precision timing for activation, a low-orbiting\n\nhigh-resolution imager may miss a target without milli-\nsecond precision in activating the camera. Hence, whe-\nther a command can execute within a given second or at a\ncertain millisecond is dependent on the instruments or\nconfiguration of the spacecraft.\nCommands can come in the form of multiple sources and\n\nfor multiple purposes. Real-time commands are sent by the\noperations team via the ground system. The flight software\ngives precedence to this type of command over others to\nallow for direct communication by the ground team. This\nallows mission operations to override any stored commands\nthat may be in the midst of executing, and it provides a\nmechanism for immediate interaction with the flight soft-\nware. A spacecraft also may have a set of time-triggered\ncommands. These are one or more commands that execute\nwhen the flight software recognizes either that a given time\nhas elapsed or that a certain time has been reached. Time-\ntagged commands are especially important for deep-space\nmissions because of the frequent communications outages\nwith ground operators and long light-trip times. Time-tag-\nged commands are similar in nature to the pre-stored\nsequencer commands in early spacecraft missions.\n\nMost spacecraft have some form of autonomous behav-\nior to monitor spacecraft health and ensure that an appro-\npriate response is executed in the case of any failures or\nunexpected events. Autonomy can range from rudimentary\nrule checkers that monitor and compare telemetry against a\npre-stored set of values to complex artificial intelligence\nsystems that rely on technology such as expert systems.\n\nA macro is any functionality that allows large sets of\ncommands to be stored on-board the spacecraft and then\ntriggered by a single telecommand. They can also be trig-\ngered by other elements of the system, such as time tags,\nautonomy, or real-time events. The use of macros can sig-\nnificantly reduce the amount of communications bandwidth\nrequired to execute in real time because they are already\nstored on the spacecraft before executing.\n\nScripting allows for more complex on-board operation\nthan can be attained through simple macros. A script can\ntake a form similar to programming languages and include\nconstructs such as \u2018while\u2019 loops and \u2018if\u2019 statements that\nmust be interpreted on-board. However, although it\nincreases flexibility, a scripting language can require more\nprocessing time to interpret the symbols of the script and\nmust be prevented from executing typical programming\nerrors such as variables overflowing.\n\n16.8.2.2 Telemetry\nTelemetry is the data returned from the spacecraft. Telem-\netry consists of housekeeping data and science data.\nHousekeeping contains information concerning the health\nand safety of the spacecraft, instruments, and payloads. A\nkey element in designing the flight software telemetry is to\n\n16 Flight Software 481\n\n\n\ndetermine the frequency and priority of the various ele-\nments. Priority in the housekeeping data should be given to\nhighly dynamic data as opposed to data that typically are\nunchanged unless by command; this reduces the overhead\nof sending data that rarely change. The flight software\ncollects these data in the form of packets and frames. As\nwith commanding, most spacecraft use CCSDS standards as\nthe basis for this process. AOS is again an option, as is the\nCCSDS telemetry (TM) standard [5].\n\nTM has less layering than TC because it consists only of\na frame header and a frame footer. Framing can be per-\nformed via either hardware or software. If software is used,\na telemetry application collects formatted data from the\nvarious subsystems and tasks and encases the data in TM\nframes. For this example, data are contained in variable-\nsized CCSDS packets. Variable- and fixed-sized CCSDS\npackets have their respective advantages. For example,\nvariable-sized packets can reduce bandwidth waste because\npackets are sized to only the data needed, but fixed-length\npackets can ease ground processing and frame creation.\n\nAs robotic spacecraft are rarely in constant communi-\ncation with the ground system, the flight software must\nrecord telemetry that will then be played back when the RF\nsystem allows. Modern spacecraft use an SSR for this\npurpose. At its core, the SSR consists of a large array of\neither volatile or non-volatile memory. An SSR can range\nfrom several megabytes to hundreds of gigabytes.\nDepending on the location of the SSR, the flight software\nmaps the memory of the SSR for access by the recording\ntask. The flight software records data either by storing the\ndata raw in customized data structures or through the use of\na file system. Multiple factors affect the architecture for\nstoring data. Raw partitions typically use less RAM on the\non-board processor and require less complex software to\nmanage. A file system gives more flexibility because it uses\ncommon interface calls for opening, reading, writing, and\nclosing files. However, file systems tend to require more\nRAM to store the structure of the file system. The recording\napplication must also accommodate the type of memory\nused to store the data on the SSR. Two types of memory are\nprimarily in use on SSRs: (1) SDRAM and (2) Flash.\nSDRAM requires less complex software because it can be\n\nread and written similarly to the SRAM on a flight pro-\ncessor, albeit with slower access times. However, SDRAM\nis volatile, and the data are lost when power is removed\nfrom the SSR. Flash, on the other hand, is non-volatile but\nrequires more complex software to access the data. When\nwriting to Flash, an entire sector (the minimum unit of\nerasure which can be multiple bytes) must be erased before\nstoring the data to memory, as opposed to modifying single\nbytes. Additionally, the software must accommodate wear\nleveling because Flash will lose functionality if written too\noften.\n\nOnce a downlink session is available, the mission oper-\nations team instructs the flight software to downlink the\ndata. The software application for downlinking the data\ndepends on how the data have been stored. If the data are\nstored as raw packets, the software can retrieve the data\nfrom the SSR and insert the packets directly into the\ntelemetry stream. When using CCSDS TM, playback data\nare placed in a different virtual channel to allow the ground\nsoftware to distinguish between real-time and playback\nframes. If the data are stored as files, the flight software can\nuse a mechanism such as the CCSDS file delivery protocol\n(CFDP), a protocol similar to the file transfer protocol\n(FTP), which enables transmission of files between the\nground and spacecraft systems [6]. A typical CFDP trans-\naction is shown in Fig. 16.4.\n\nTo process a CFDP transaction, the flight software\nbreaks a file into multiple pieces called protocol data units\n(PDU), which are framed and sent to the ground one by one\nin the form of file information and file segments. Once the\nfile has been sent, the spacecraft notifies the ground that the\ntransmission is complete by sending an end-of-file (EOF)\nmarker. The ground acknowledges receipt of this informa-\ntion via an acknowledgment (ACK) PDU and then re-\ntransmits missing pieces via a negative acknowledgment\n(NAK) or, if all data have been received correctly, instructs\nthe spacecraft to terminate the transaction through a finished\nindicator (FIN). The spacecraft then responds accordingly\nby either resending data or closing the transaction.\n\nIn designing the playback system, the flight software\narchitecture must account for the additional processing time\nrequired to extract data from the SSR as well as maintaining\n\nFig. 16.3 A layered architecture\nenables separation of\nfunctionality\n\n482 C. Krupiarz et al.\n\n\n\npace with the downlink rate. Because the SSR is usually\nlocated off of the processor card, SSR accesses are slower\nthan direct RAM access. Unlike the low rates for command\nuplink, the playback task must accommodate higher rates\nfrom hundreds of kilobits per second to several megabits per\nsecond depending on the spacecraft capabilities. This creates\na high interrupt rate as the RF is requesting frames more\nfrequently and introduces a large amount of processor\noverhead in creating the frames. At sufficiently high down-\nlink rates, system developers may target a trade that shares\nthe downlink processing between software and hardware.\n\n16.8.3 Communication Interfaces\n\nTo collect data from instruments or transmit and receive\ndata from other subsystems, the spacecraft flight software\ncommunicates across various electrical interfaces. These\ninterfaces include dedicated serial links as well common\nbuses, such as MIL-STD-1553B or SpaceWire which are\ndiscussed in detail in Chap. 15, and summarized here from\na software perspective.\n\n16.8.3.1 Serial Links\nSpacecraft use serial links similar to those in terrestrial\napplications. Spacecraft designers use three primary proto-\ncols for serial communication: RS-232, RS-422, and RS-\n485. RS-232 is the oldest of these protocols and the sim-\nplest. Until recently, RS-232 ports were also seen frequently\n\non personal computers. RS-422 and RS-485 are also heavily\nused for industrial platforms.\n\n16.8.3.2 Mil-std-1553b\nThe MIL-STD-1553B bus interface originated in military\navionics. It has a redundant interface with time-division\nmultiplexing and the ability to communicate with nodes on\na network. Activity on a 1553 bus is controlled by the bus\ncontroller (BC), typically on the main processor of the\nspacecraft. The other nodes on the 1553 network are called\nremote terminals (RT). The BC instructs the RTs either to\nreceive or transmit data as needed. The BC selects one of\nthe data lines on the bus to be the prime, and when a\ntransaction fails on that bus, it is retried on the different\nwire. A bus monitor can be included in a 1553 architecture\nto observe bus activity.\n\nThere are multiple types of transactions on a 1553 bus.\nThese include instructions to transmit and receive data,\nbroadcast data from the BC, mode code commands, and\nRT-to-RT transfers.\n\nA 1553 bus can be either synchronous or asynchronous,\nalthough most systems are synchronous. A key design ele-\nment for a synchronous 1553 design is the bus schedule,\nwhich consists of a major frame that occurs at 1 s intervals\nand multiple minor frames that occur at a sub-second\ninterval such as 50 Hz. During each minor frame, the BC\nexecutes a set of transactions that are performed during that\nsub-second. The 1553 software designer must design the\nbus schedule to work within the constraints of the 1553\n\nFig. 16.4 CFDP enables FTP-\nlike downlink of files\n\n16 Flight Software 483\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_15\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_15\n\n\nbandwidth to ensure that all transmissions can be accom-\nmodated during the interval and also allow for margins in\nthe event that the bus schedule is modified after launch.\n\nBecause 1553 has been in use for a number of years,\nthere are multiple chip manufacturers that have developed\nprocessors that perform the lower-level protocol operations.\nThis alleviates much of the work required by the flight\nsoftware.\n\n16.8.3.3 SpaceWire\nSpaceWire is similar to 1553 in that it provides a common\ninterface to the various elements on a spacecraft network,\nbut it has a much higher bandwidth and does not require the\ntime division of the 1553 bus. The advantage of the latter\ndifference is that data can be sent when available, but it can\nalso make operation of the bus less deterministic and prone\nto collisions. This requires care in planning bus operations\nto prevent, for example, a large but low-priority instrument\npacket that blocks delivery of a more critical packet such as\na thruster command. The flight software can alleviate some\nof this by introducing additional processing to ensure that\ntransactions do not conflict\u2014essentially introducing a bus\nschedule capability of time division. However, this can\nreduce bandwidth given that the time is reserved regardless\nof whether or not a transaction occurs and can introduce\njitter and delay as a transaction awaits an opportunity to\ntransmit.\n\nCollisions on the SpaceWire bus can also be avoided\nthrough the use of alternate (redundant) paths dedicated to\nhigh-priority packets and/or ensuring that the paths of these\npackets do not overlap. Group-adaptive routing is a method\nfor automatically switching packet delivery to an alternate\npath if the primary route is unavailable because of con-\ngestion or link failure.\n\nAnother important difference is that the 1553 specifica-\ntion mandates redundancy through a pair of links and\nautomatic error detection and switching between them.\nSpaceWire requires explicit planning to ensure the physical\navailability of alternate paths and, with the exception of\ngroup-adaptive routing, software protocols to ensure reli-\nability. Several protocols have been proposed that include\nerror detection and packet transmission; however, these\nprotocols have not been fully standardized at this time and,\nunlike 1553, are not an inherent capability of the system.\n\n16.8.4 Additional On-board Processing\n\nAs the processing capability of processors increases, addi-\ntional applications are being added to the spacecraft com-\nputer that extend beyond typical data-handling and\nguidance and control tasks. Note that the GN&C application\nis considered separately in Sect. 16.9.\n\n16.8.4.1 Compression\nDownlink bandwidth is scarce, particularly for deep-space\nmissions, and the greatest use of this bandwidth is science\ndata. The flight software reduces this strain on the system by\ncompressing the data. Data compression comes in two\nforms: (1) lossless and (2) lossy. Lossless data compression\nis less efficient than lossy compression, but, upon decom-\npression, it retains the dynamic range of all of the data\nrecorded. Lossy compression can reduce the amount of data\nplayed back, but at the cost of losing some of the data detail.\nThe use of lossy or lossless data is data dependent. For\ninstance, a lossy image may result in an acceptable loss of\nresolution, whereas lossy data for another instrument may\nmake the data useless. In both cases, loss of some of the\ndata in transmission can result in uncorrectable data on the\nground. When compression is used, reliable transmission of\ndata through capabilities such as CFDP is particularly\nimportant.\n\n16.8.4.2 Image Processing\nAn alternative to compression is performing on-board\nimage processing to reduce science data and download only\nthe scientifically interesting data. For example, an experi-\nment on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft took images of the\nMars polar ice cap to determine its size and location.\nInstead of downlinking every image, the on-board software\ncalculated the latitude of the ice cap and only transmitted\nthat information. It is also possible to develop software to\ndistinguish characteristics of rocks such as structure, color,\nand texture, and use these characteristics to identify images\nthat contain features that are unusual and that may interest\nthe scientists on the ground.\n\n16.8.4.3 On-board Mission Planning\nAlong with autonomy, another area where flight software\ndevelopers are applying the capabilities of artificial intelli-\ngence is mission planning. To make operations simpler and\nmore flexible, on-board planning software enables the\nspacecraft to be directed to perform high-level tasks rather\nthan sending large numbers of very detailed commands. The\nsoftware is then able to autonomously plan the observations\non the basis of this information and knowledge of the\nspacecraft\u2019s current status. This enables the spacecraft to\nquickly adapt to changing conditions by replanning the\nmission operations if circumstances change or to observe\nscientifically interesting events that could not be identified\nwith the delay in ground communications.\n\n16.8.5 Other Subsystem Support\n\nAlthough not as extensive as the primary computer archi-\ntecture, software is also prevalent in additional subsystems\n\n484 C. Krupiarz et al.\n\n\n\nbesides C&DH (Sect. 16.8.2) and GN&C (Sect. 16.9).\nInstances of software outside of the main process include\n\u2022 Power\u2014a power system may need to perform peak-\n\npower tracking and battery performance analysis.\n\u2022 RF\u2014engineers are increasingly turning to software to\n\nfurther expand communications capabilities (in particu-\nlar, software-defined radios that can be reconfigured as\nneeded to suit a mission\u2019s needs).\n\n\u2022 Instruments\u2014some instrument software is reaching the\ncomplexity of the main computer, to include compression\nsoftware, data recording on their own SSRs, and image\nprocessing. At a minimum, instruments must have the\nability to execute commands, return telemetry, and\ninterface to the main computer.\n\n16.9 Guidance, Navigation, and Control\n\nGN&C is a control system. The primary functions of its\nsubsystems are to maintain spacecraft attitude, to execute\npropulsive maneuvers for spacecraft trajectory control, and\nto provide a navigation function that maintains positional\nknowledge within a given frame of reference. The GN&C\nsubsystem is discussed in detail in Chap. 12.\n\nThe GN&C software accumulates data from various\ndevices to control the spacecraft. For example, sensor inputs\nsuch as IMUs and STs provide body rate information and\nknowledge of the inertial orientation of the vehicle. Actu-\nator outputs such as thrusters, torque rods, and reaction\nwheels (RW) exert forces on the vehicle to establish the\ndesired attitude or, in the case of a propulsive maneuver, to\nchange the vehicle\u2019s velocity along a given vector in inertial\nspace.\n\nNavigation refers to the determination, at a given time,\nof a vehicle\u2019s position, velocity, and attitude, commonly\nreferred to as the vehicle\u2019s \u2018state vector\u2019 or, simply, \u2018state\u2019;\nsee Sect. 4.1.4. Guidance refers to the ability to determine\nthe change in the vehicle\u2019s state to take it from the current\nstate to a commanded or target state. Finally, the control\ntask directly commands the actuators that physically move\nor rotate the vehicle on the basis of inputs from the sensors\nas well as commands from the guidance task. Typical\nGN&C sensors include aforementioned IMUs, STs, and\nSSs. Typical actuators include RWs, magnetotorquer rods,\nand attitude control thrusters as propulsion.\n\nFlight software development for GN&C generally\ninvolves both flight software developers as well as GN&C\nanalysts who have a high level of knowledge of spacecraft\ndynamics. As a result, the GN&C flight software includes\nalgorithms developed with input from the GN&C analysts\nplus the \u2018wrapper code\u2019 that enables integration into the\noverall flight software architecture. In general, the GN&C\nalgorithms are provided to the flight software team in one of\n\ntwo ways: either in the form of an algorithm description\ndocument (ADD), from which the algorithms are directly\nconverted to flight software; or more typically, in the form\nof a pretested software library or set of functions that have\nbeen auto-generated from a development environment used\nby the analysts. The wrapper code, then, is typically\nresponsible for integrating the auto-generated GN&C\nalgorithms, acquiring and formatting time-stamped sensor\ndata, executing the algorithms, and formatting and applying\nthe corresponding commands to the actuators. It is also\nresponsible for forwarding commands from the C&DH and\nproviding often extensive telemetry back to the C&DH for\ndownlink to the ground.\n\nThe software executes the GN&C algorithms at a fixed\nrate and with typical execution cycles of 50 Hz for control\nand 1 Hz for guidance and navigation. Critically, the\ninternal clock from which the execution rates are derived is,\nin turn, synchronized to MET, UTC, or some other time\nstandard.\n\nFrom a GN&C perspective, the architectural impact of a\nsoftware bus system is that it is data-driven, whereas the\nGN&C, as stated above, can be perceived as a synchronous\ncontrol loop. It is up to the software designer, as well as the\nGN&C analysts, to ensure that these two very different\napproaches do not conflict. In other words, it is important\nthat sensor data, even though they are time-tagged, be read\nand processed in such a way that they are provided to the\ncontrol and guidance tasks within the time boundaries\nexpected for those data. Similarly, it is important that any\noutput control data to RWs and attitude control thrusters not\nbe delayed.\n\n16.9.1 Process Flow\n\nAlthough there is overlap between writing code for C&DH\nsoftware and GN&C software, the GN&C process flow is\ncovered here to illustrate the unique aspects of this system\u2019s\ndevelopment. Figure 16.5 shows a high-level version of the\nprocess that leads from the initial definition of requirements\nto the final delivery of the GN&C software to the spacecraft.\nEach part of the process can be viewed as iterative. The\nGN&C analysts develop the algorithms from the require-\nments while continually testing within their workstation-\nbased environment until a working version can be passed to\nthe flight software and test bed development areas. Those\nareas, in turn, integrate the algorithms and develop the\nassociated wrapper code for acquiring sensor data, reading\nand applying actuator data, commands, and telemetry. Once\nunit testing is complete, the combined algorithms and\nwrapper code in both the flight and test bed are integrated into\na HIL test environment or, alternatively, into an intermediate\nSIL test environment. Developers now have a complete test\n\n16 Flight Software 485\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_12\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nenvironment that includes sensor and actuator models as well\nas the capability to send commands and output telemetry. In\nparallel to the ongoing development effort and unit tests,\nindependent testing of the algorithms can now also proceed\nin such a way that as the developers continue with unit testing\nof one software build, independent testing is validating the\nprevious build. Finally, once all of the functionality has been\nincluded and independently tested, the GN&C software is\nintegrated onto the spacecraft as part of the spacecraft inte-\ngration and testing (I&T) activities.\n\n16.9.1.1 Software Development of GN&C\nAlgorithms\n\nThere are, in general, two main approaches commonly in use\nfor the development of GN&C algorithms. The first and less\ncommon approach is that the algorithms are functionally and\nmathematically described by GN&C analysts in the form of\nan ADD from which GN&C software specialists convert the\nalgorithms into flight code. The ADD might include example\ncode that has been used to validate the algorithms within the\nanalyst\u2019s development and test environment. The advantage\nof this approach is that the GN&C analysts can focus on the\nspecifics of the algorithms and not then be encumbered by the\nprocess associated with the development of mission-critical\nflight code. The disadvantage is that the software developers\nthemselves must have sufficient skill to understand and\ninterpret the algorithm in order to properly design, code, and\n\nthen unit test the algorithms, which is a skill set that is not\noften available in the workforce.\n\nThe second and most common approach is one in which\nthe GN&C analysts develop the algorithms within a model\nfrom which the algorithms are subsequently auto-generated\ninto C or C++ code. This code is then provided as a library\nor a self-contained set of functions and methods that\nencapsulate the entire set of GN&C algorithms. The tool set\nof choice is typically a commercial product within which an\nanalyst can design, simulate, and test the GN&C algorithms\nand models. The main advantage of this approach is that the\nalgorithms as developed and tested in the modeling envi-\nronment are incorporated directly into the flight code\nwithout interpretation by a software developer. The flight\nsoftware engineer instead focuses on developing the wrap-\nper code, which integrates the model into the overall flight\nsoftware by acquiring and providing inputs to the models,\nexecuting the models, and then reading the corresponding\noutputs. The disadvantage of this approach is primarily one\nof visibility\u2014the auto-generated code is typically not\nreadily readable or accessible. Instead, it becomes a \u2018black\nbox\u2019 that accepts inputs and generates outputs, but the\nsystem depends on the reliability of the auto-generated\ncode. Hence, the confidence in the design from a software\nperspective comes down to testing and verification that the\nperformance of the models is identical to that of the\nworkstation environment that was used by the analysts.\n\nFig. 16.5 GN&C software\ndevelopment process flow with\nindependent verification and\nvalidation (IV&V) testing\n\n486 C. Krupiarz et al.\n\n\n\n16.9.1.2 Model Construction\nIn using either technique for model development, the resul-\ntant software must be constructed within the confines of an\nembedded environment. The models cannot be a loose and\nhaphazard collation of algorithms but must be a well-\ndesigned architecture within which inputs, parameters, and\noutputs and model rates are clearly defined and consistent\nwith the flight environment. It is a primary assumption that\nthe GN&C analysts work closely with the software devel-\nopers to structure their models to target an embedded system\nand to enforce naming conventions on inputs and outputs as\nwell as internal parameters that will support external auto-\ncoding methods in support of the auto-generation offlight and\nground databases.\n\n16.9.2 Implementation Issues\n\n16.9.2.1 Time\nAs stated above, because GN&C is a control system, the\nexecution of the GN&C algorithms is tightly controlled,\nmeaning time-tagging of input data and the corresponding\nmodel execution must be synchronized to a known time\nepoch, generally provided by an internal clock with the\nflight computer. The time tag can be in many formats, most\ncommonly MET, which counts in integer seconds from a\nknown epoch; others include the CCSDS unsegmented time\ncode (CUC), International Atomic Time, and Terrestrial\nDynamical Time. Although there are many choices, the\nfundamental basis of all of them is that they provide a\ncontiguous measurement of time referenced to a known\ntime epoch, such as the J2000 epoch (see Sect. 4.1.6), with\nsome offset that may have to be periodically adjusted. Time\nand the measurement and management of it on a spacecraft\nis a complex subject. However, purely from a software\nperspective, the goal is to provide the GN&C subsystem\nwith time-tagged sensor inputs, execute the models at a\nknown rate consistent with that epoch or at least with\nknowledge of that epoch, and then apply the corresponding\nactuator outputs at the designated control rate.\n\n16.9.2.2 Model Execution\nGN&C models must execute at the rates defined by the\nanalysts. This can be anywhere from 1 up to 100 Hz but is\ntypically 50 Hz. In a \u2018simple\u2019 GN&C system, inputs are\n\u2018gathered\u2019 at every model \u2018step\u2019 (e.g., every 20 ms for a 50-\nHz control rate), the model is executed, the model takes\nsome time less than the 20-ms period allocated to it, and, on\nreturn, the outputs are gathered and applied to the respective\nactuators, and/or output as telemetry. The priority of the\nsingle task must be set high enough within the operating\nsystem to guarantee that the control task completes within\n\nthe 20-ms period or else a system-level anomaly is raised\nthat may lead, in some cases, to a processor reset. This\ntypically means that the GN&C task priority is set to second\nor third highest right after device drivers.\n\nIn a more complex GN&C system that includes major\nnavigation or guidance components, there may not be suf-\nficient CPU resources to execute every desired control rate\nwithout \u2018starving\u2019 the CPU of execution bandwidth needed\nfor other tasks. There is no hard-and-fast rule for what per-\ncentage of the CPU the GN&C control algorithms are\nallowed; however, a good guideline is that they are allowed\napproximately 10 % of the available bandwidth. If not,\neither the control rate must be reduced (requirements will\nnot be met) or the models can be executed in a multitasking\nenvironment where the control aspect in GN&C continues to\nexecute at the control rate while the navigation, guidance,\nand other lower-priority functions within the GN&C execute\nat lower rates (typically 1 Hz and as much as 10 Hz for\nguidance, again depending on the mission requirements). In\ngeneral, the model sub-rates typically have a modulo rela-\ntionship that is evenly divisible by the control rate and not\nsome arbitrary rate. This, of course, means that the model\nmust be designed with this multi-rate requirement in mind.\nHowever, purely from a software perspective, it means that\ncorresponding wrapper code must gather input data for the\ndifferent rates, execute those sub-rates as separate tasks or\nthreads, wait for them to complete execution, and gather the\noutputs. Again, the priority of the different tasks is set to\nguarantee completion of those tasks within the time period\nallocated. Generally, the high-rate task must be set to a high\npriority, but the lower-rate tasks can be set to much lower\npriorities. However, if the model is dominated by a single\nrate, and only a few blocks execute at a slower rate, multi-\ntasking can actually degrade performance. In such a model,\nthe overhead incurred in task switching can be greater than\nthe time required to execute the slower blocks. In this case, it\nis more efficient to execute all blocks at the dominant rate.\n\n16.9.2.3 Asynchronous Model Execution\nIt is also possible to have asynchronous execution of some\nmodel component, particularly algorithmic components that\nmay take several seconds or even minutes to complete. An\nexample of this might be an orbit integrator that draws in\nlarge amounts of data that are subsequently integrated,\nresulting in a lengthy process simply because of the volume\nof data involved and the iterative nature of the algorithm. In\nthis case, the independent task is assigned one of the lowest\npriorities within the CPU and is executed whenever the data\nit needs are available. Once complete, perhaps several\nminutes later, the results are forwarded to the GN&C\nmodel\u2019s function that requires the input at some modulo rate\nboundary, typically 1 Hz.\n\n16 Flight Software 487\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\n16.9.3 Managing Inputs\n\nTypical GN&C sensors include IMUs, star trackers, and\nSun sensors, to name but a few. Although they all execute at\ndiffering rates, the common aspect between them is that the\ninputs are read from the low-level device driver, such as\nRS-422, SpaceWire, or MIL-STD-1553, at the native rate\nfor that device; the data are then time-tagged or otherwise\nassociated with a time, given a \u2018health-check\u2019, and then\nprovided as input within the same time boundary.\n\nIMUs typically provide body rate and acceleration data\nat a cadence at least twice the control rate (typically at a rate\nof 100 or 400 Hz) and are not typically synchronized to the\nmodel execution rates. For example, for a notional 50-Hz\ncontrol rate, two 100-Hz IMU samples are read, their data\nare then typically checked for staleness, and the IMU status\nflags are read to ensure that there is no internal fault; the\ndata are then time-tagged if a time tag is not already pro-\nvided by the device itself, supplied as input to the control\ntask, and likely buffered for use by the lower rate navigation\nand guidance tasks as well as diagnostic telemetry.\n\nAn ST that provides inertial attitude knowledge as well\nas rate data is, however, typically synchronized to the\ncontrol rate. For a 10-Hz tracker, attitude data, rate data, and\ndevice status are read once every fifth 50-Hz control cycle.\nThe data are typically checked for staleness, internal status\ncodes are checked for internal errors, and the data are time-\ntagged and buffered. Sometimes ST rate data are provided to\ncontrol as a low-rate measure of body rates in case the IMU\ncuts out or simply as a secondary check against the IMU-\ndetected rates, but generally, all 10 samples and associated\nhealth checks are provided to the guidance task as well as\nbeing buffered for diagnostic telemetry.\n\nA low-rate sensor such as an SS is typically read at 1 Hz\nbut in exactly the same way as the higher-rate sensors. That\nis, the data are read, health-checked, time-tagged, and\nprovided, in this case, to guidance to typically verify\nspacecraft attitude or spin rates.\n\n16.9.4 Managing Outputs\n\nTypical actuators include RWs, torque rods, and attitude\ncontrol thrusters as well as main propulsion engines.\n\nReaction wheel assemblies (RWA) are typically con-\ntrolled at the control rate of the GN&C system. At the\ncompletion of the control task execution period, the RWA\ntorque is read, sometimes formatted as required by the\nRWA and intermediate controlling hardware, immediately\noutput within the control period, and finally buffered for the\npurposes of diagnostic telemetry.\n\nAttitude control thrusters, which can be composed of\nthrusters of varying force capability, are also typically\n\ncontrolled at the control rate. At the completion of the\ncontrol task execution period, the on/off status of individual\nthrusters is read, often formatted as required by the inter-\nmediate controlling hardware, immediately output before\nthe end of the control period, and finally buffered for the\npurposes of diagnostic telemetry. Before using the thrusters,\nthere is usually a series of \u2018thruster preparation\u2019 commands\nto open various valves, turn on heaters, and so on, which are\ntypically executed as part of a time-tagged command\nsequence that is outside of the GN&C subsystem and gen-\nerally managed by the C&DH subsystem. This is particularly\ntrue of propulsion maneuvers, which are designed to impart\na propulsive force along a specific direction, resulting in a\nchange in spacecraft velocity (DV) along a particular tra-\njectory. However, during the burn itself, control of the\npropulsion system (such as valves and heaters) may require\ngreater control than that offered by an open-loop control via\na sequence of time-tagged commands. In such a case, the\nGN&C typically is responsible for real-time valve switching\nas well as monitoring of the internal status of the propulsion\nsystem throughout the duration of the burn.\n\nTorque rods or torque coils are devices that are typically\nused in low-Earth orbit in order to manage the attitude and\nmomentum of the spacecraft by taking advantage of the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field. There are typically three that are\nconfigured orthogonally and controlled at a 1-Hz rate.\nMagnetic force is applied and controlled by switching the\npolarity of the individual rods based on a magnetic field\nmodel within the guidance or navigation components as well\nas inputs from a corresponding magnetometer sensor; this\nrequires that the torque rods or coils be off during the reading\nof the ambient magnetic field that surrounds the spacecraft.\n\n16.10 MESSENGER Case Study\n\nTo illustrate a full flight software architecture, the following\nsection outlines the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment,\nGEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft to\nprovide an example of the general principles described in\npreceding sections [7].\n\n16.10.1 Spacecraft Overview\n\nA simplified block diagram of the MESSENGER spacecraft\nis shown in Fig. 16.6. The spacecraft has two fully redun-\ndant integrated electronic modules (IEM), which contain the\nspacecraft bus processors. Each IEM contains an MP and a\nfault protection processor (FPP). These are RAD6000 pro-\ncessors, which execute the flight software applications. The\nflight software is implemented as C code that operates under\nthe VxWorks RTOS.\n\n488 C. Krupiarz et al.\n\n\n\n16.10.2 Main Processors\n\nThe MP software implements all C&DH and GN&C\nfunctionality in a single flight-code application. Only one\nMP is designated \u2018active\u2019 or \u2018primary\u2019 and executes the full\nMP flight application. The \u2018redundant\u2019 or \u2018backup\u2019 MP\ntypically remains unpowered because of MESSENGER\nmission power constraints, and serves as a cold spare. The\nbackup MP, if powered, remains in boot mode and supports\nrudimentary command processing and telemetry generation\nfor the purpose of reporting the health status of that pro-\ncessor, and to support uploads of code and parameters to\nEEPROM. It operates as an RT on the 1553 data bus. The\nprimary MP serves as 1553 BC and manages all commu-\nnication with devices on that bus.\n\nC&DH functionality in the primary MP includes\n\u2022 Uplink and downlink management using CCSDS protocols.\n\u2022 Command processing and dispatch to other spacecraft\n\nprocessors and components.\n\u2022 Support for stored commands (command macros) and\n\ntime-tagged commands.\n\u2022 Management of an 8 Gbit SSR using a file system.\n\u2022 Science data collection.\n\u2022 Image compression.\n\u2022 Telemetry generation.\n\u2022 Memory load and dump functions.\n\u2022 Support for transmission of files from the SSR on the\n\ndownlink using CFDP.\nThe uplink and downlink functions include control of\n\ntwo transponders via the 1553 bus. C&DH software also\ncollects analog temperature data from temperature remote\ninput output (TRIO) sensors, via a 1553 interface to the\npower distribution unit, and implements a peak-power\ntracking algorithm to optimize charging of the spacecraft\nbattery via the power distribution unit interface. To support\noperational autonomy actions, the MP incorporates the\nsame autonomy rule engine that is implemented in the FPP\nsoftware. A number of C&DH functions interface to the\nspacecraft through an interface card that is in the IEM. For\nexample, the uplink/downlink data buffers are on that card.\nThe interface card also allows critical hardware commands\nto be sent from the ground or the FPP to force resets of\nspacecraft processors.\n\nGN&C functionality in the primary MP includes atti-\ntude determination and attitude control, support for\nnumerous spacecraft pointing modes, active control of\nsolar panel orientation with respect to the Sun, momentum\nmanagement, and two spacecraft safety modes: Safe Hold\nand Earth Acquisition. Safe Hold mode maintains a fixed\npower-positive pointing angle with respect to the Sun,\nwith an antenna pointing to the Earth. Earth Acquisition\nmode addresses loss of attitude or time knowledge and is\ncapable of pointing to the Sun using SS inputs, while\n\nrotating about the Sun line to establish communications\nwith Earth.\n\nThe GN&C software controls attitude with RWs or\nthrusters. Thrusters are used for trajectory correction\nmaneuvers, including Mercury orbit insertion, and to reduce\nspacecraft momentum. GN&C sensors include two STs, an\nIMU that is internally redundant, and digital solar attitude\ndetectors (DSADs, usually referred to as SSs). GN&C\nsoftware also manages a precise ephemeris and a coarse\nephemeris to support attitude determination. GN&C soft-\nware interfaces to the STs, IMU, and phased-array con-\ntrollers (to actively steer the high-gain phased-array\nantennas to point to Earth) via the 1553 bus. The remaining\nGN&C sensors and actuators have custom hardware inter-\nfaces to the PDU, which, in turn, provides a command and\ntelemetry interface to those devices via the 1553 data bus.\nThese devices include the RWA, propulsion system, SSs,\nand solar-array drive electronics (SADE).\n\nThe primary MP interfaces to two data processing units\n(DPU) and the two FPPs via the 1553 data bus. The DPUs\nprovide the interface to all other instrument processors.\nGN&C software in the MP passes data to the primary DPU\nto route attitude data to the imager and laser altimeter\ninstruments, and to actively steer the imager pivot motor.\n\n16.10.3 Fault Protection Processors\n\nThe two FPPs are on unswitched power so that both are\nalways powered, although a critical hardware command\nallows ground controllers to hold either in boot mode if\nneeded. Each FPP executes an identical flight code applica-\ntion that supports a command and telemetry interface to the\nMPs via the 1553 data bus. The main purpose of each FPP is\nto perform fault detection and to isolate fault correction\nresponses within these processors. Each FPP implements an\nautonomy rule engine, which accepts uploadable health and\nsafety rules that can operate on data collected from the 1553\ndata bus or a state message transmitted by the primary MP. In\naddition to being an RT on the 1553 bus, each FPP serves as a\n1553 bus monitor to collect spacecraft data that can be\nmonitored by autonomy rules. The rules are expressed in\nreverse Polish notation, and the action of each rule can dis-\npatch a command (or a series of commands from a stored FPP\nmacro) to the primary MP for subsequent execution by the\nMP to correct faults. Fault correction can include actions\nsuch as switching to redundant components, demotion to\nSafe Hold or Earth Acquisition mode, or shedding power\nloads. Additionally, the FPPs have a custom serial interface\nvia the interface card to the PDUs in order to receive PDU\ncritical status updates or send special commands in the event\nof loss of 1553 bus communications or a failed MP. The PDU\ncommand interface allows the FPPs to swap the BC\n\n16 Flight Software 489\n\n\n\nfunctionality between MPs, reset the MP in its own IEM,\nselect which of two stored flight applications either MP loads\nand executes, or power on and switch to the redundant MP\nand declare it primary.\n\n16.10.4 MP and FPP Boot Software\n\nThe primary function of the boot software in the MPs and\nFPPs is to perform processor and memory diagnostic tests,\nprocessor and hardware backplane initialization functions,\nand verification-load-launch of one of two stored flight-code\napplications (as designated by hardware signals that can be\nset by ground command via the critical command decoder).\nThe primary MP and both FPPs always progress from boot\ncode to execution of the designated flight software appli-\ncation in RAM. Only the backup MP, if powered on,\nremains in boot mode. The boot software for the backup MP\nincludes support to maintain communications with the pri-\nmary MP by acting as an RT on the 1553 data bus.\n\n16.10.5 Spacecraft Instruments\n\nThe MESSENGER spacecraft includes two DPUs. Only one\nDPU is designated \u2018primary\u2019 and interfaces to the suite of\n\nother instrument event-processing units (EPUs) via serial\ninterfaces. It communicates with the MP via the 1553 data\nbus and is the processor that provides all science data and\ntelemetry to the MP and accepts all instrument commands\nfrom the MP. The backup DPU is typically unpowered\nbecause of MESSENGER power constraints. Only the pri-\nmary DPU interfaces to the seven instrument processors\n(EPUs). The backup DPU can take over as primary to\ncontrol the EPUs, but there is no ability to control some\nfrom one DPU and the remainder from the second DPU.\nThe MESSENGER instruments include\n\u2022 Mercury dual imaging system (MDIS). The MDIS\n\ninstrument hardware is controlled by software that is part\nof the DPU flight application.\n\n\u2022 Magnetometer (MAG).\n\u2022 X-ray spectrometer (XRS).\n\u2022 Energetic particle and plasma spectrometer (EPPS).\n\u2022 Gamma-ray and neutron spectrometer (GRNS).\n\u2022 Mercury laser altimeter (MLA).\n\u2022 Mercury atmospheric and surface composition spec-\n\ntrometer (MASCS).\nThe DPUs and the EPUs for all instruments except MLA\n\neach use an RTX2010 processor, and the flight software is\nimplemented in the Forth language, which is native to that\nprocessor. The processor for the MLA instrument uses an\n\nFig. 16.6 MESSENGER\nspacecraft block diagram\n\n490 C. Krupiarz et al.\n\n\n\nIntel 80C196KD processor, with the CMX operating system\nand software written in C.\n\nThe flight software for the RTX2010-based DPU and\nEPUs shares a core of \u2018common\u2019 Forth code that imple-\nments standard functionality such as communications\ninterfaces, memory management, and command macro\nstorage and processing. In addition, each of the DPU and\nEPU flight applications has instrument-specific Forth code\nto implement the functionality unique to each instrument.\n\nTime is distributed to the instruments via a hardware\ninterface that provides the 1 pulse-per-second (PPS) clock\nto the DPU, which passes it on to each EPU. The primary\nMP uses a 1553 bus message to distribute MET to the DPU,\nwhich subsequently passes it to the EPUs so that they can\nsynchronize MET with the 1 PPS. The 1 PPS clock comes\nfrom the IEM interface card, which offers a choice of a\nprecision oscillator (needed to meet 1-ms time correlation\nrequirements for MDIS) or a coarse oscillator. Only one\ninstrument, MDIS, has an independent hardware interface\ndirectly to the IEM. Images collected by the MDIS go\ndirectly to a buffer on the interface card via a high-speed\nserial interface, so that MP flight software can manage the\nstorage of those images on the SSR file system.\n\n16.10.6 Summary\n\nSpacecraft flight software consists of multiple elements on-\nboard a spacecraft. On the main computer, typical applications\ninclude the boot software which initializes the hardware;\nC&DH which handles commanding, telemetry, and other data\nprocessing tasks; and GN&C which controls the spacecraft\u2019s\nattitude, thrusting, and other guidance tasks. Other flight\nsoftware includes applications on science payloads, power\nsystems, and transceiver and transponder modules. Due to its\ncritical nature, software engineers follow a strict development\nprocess when developing flight software. An example devel-\nopment process is the Waterfall model which has an incre-\nmental development flow from concept to requirements to\ndesign to implementation to testing to delivery. Once in-flight,\nthe software team works with mission operations to ensure full\nfunctionality of the software through support and uploads of\nnew software parameters and code images.\n\n16.11 Further Reading\n\nFor further information on the current state of spacecraft\nflight software research and concepts, consult the proceed-\nings of the annual Workshops on Spacecraft Flight Software\nlocated on the website http://www.flightsoftware.org/.\n\nBooks and publications specifically relating to spacecraft\nflight software are rare.

Wheeler\n\nExtending human activities to outer space has been a major\ntarget of space engineering from its inception. We have long\ndreamed of space flight, been curious about the origin of the\nuniverse, our solar system, and life on Earth [1]. Even with\nrecent discoveries of many extra-solar planets, Earth remains\na uniquely habitable planet. Living organisms themselves\nhave modified the terrestrial environment by their activities,\nand helped to maintain its habitability. In a spaceship or at\noutposts built on extraterrestrial bodies, life support engi-\nneering must create an environment approximating the\nEarth\u2019s biosphere. As crew sizes and system operation times\nare increased, the recycling of materials, or \u2018closing the\nloop\u2019, will gain an economic advantage over open loop\nsystems. Although the most critical index for life support\nengineering is ensuring the survivability of the space crew,\nlife management (i.e., quality of life) is also essential to the\nfulfillment of human needs.\n\n17.1 Environmental Control for Life Support\n\nOur terrestrial biosphere has evolved over the long history of\nthe Earth, and living organisms are well adapted to this\nenvironment. Each species can sustain itself within a certain\nrange of environmental parameters, such as atmospheric\ncomposition and thermal conditions. Space life support\nsystems should be equipped with the capability to synthesize\nand maintain the environment in this range for the space\ncrew and companion living organisms.\n\n17.1.1 Cabin Air\n\nA space cabin is principally a pressurized structure, main-\ntaining an atmosphere inside. Gas that leaks from the cabin\nmust be supplemented from a reservoir. The capacity of the\nreservoir and the resupply frequency is determined by the\nrate of consumption by crew and leakage from the cabin.\nLeak rates can be reduced by lowering the cabin pressure.\nDetermining the optimum cabin pressure is a trade-off\nbetween human physiology in a hypobaric environment and\nthe engineering to reduce the leak rate. The habitable upper-\naltitude for humans with the normal composition of air is\n4,000 m above sea level for ordinary life, although it is\npossible to operate at 8,000 m for a short duration. Tolerable\nranges of total pressure and partial pressure of oxygen are\nshown in Fig. 17.1 [2]. The oxygen percentage must be\nhigher in hypobaric conditions in order to prevent hypoxia,\nand since hyperoxic conditions are also known to induce a\nhealth risk, oxygen levels should be kept lower than this\nlimit. Furthermore, it is important to keep the oxygen partial\npressure and percentage below certain threshold to minimize\nfire risks. In order to prevent ignition and propagation of\ncombustion, oxygen should be diluted by inert gas species.\n\nDecompression syndrome during extra-vehicular activity\n(EVA) is another factor that influences the choice of cabin air\npressure. As EVA suits are as low as 30 kPa with pure\noxygen, a period of pre-breathing at an intermediate pressure\nshould be performed prior to an EVA. However, if the\ndecompression rate is too fast, bubbles of inert gas (mainly\nnitrogen) are formed intravenously. To avoid the formation\nof these bubbles, a well-prepared pre-EVA protocol should\nbe followed, with a staged decrease in breathing pressure.\nPre-breathing pure oxygen is known to be effective in\navoiding bubble formation. One reason that the pressure of\nthe EVA suit differs from cabin pressure is to maintain\nflexibility of the mobility joints of the EVA suit under vac-\nuum. A possible engineering approach for achieved this\n\nM. Yamashita (&)\nInstitute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), Japan\nAerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) (Emeritus), Tokyo, Japan\n\nR.

A high carbon dioxide partial pressure causes\nheadaches and nausea. The allowable carbon dioxide partial\npressure depends on the duration of exposure: 2 kPa maxi-\nmum for 1 h and 0.7 kPa for 7\u2013180 days, respectively [3].\nHumidity is maintained at an appropriate level mainly for\ncrew comfort. Common toxic gas species that can be\nreleased into the space cabin are listed in the Spacecraft\nMaximum Allowable Concentrations for Airborne Contam-\ninants (SMAC) [4]; the limits of common compounds are\ngiven in Table 17.1 [5]. These hazardous gases can be\nreleased by materials or created during accidental fires and\nother events. Use of such high-risk materials should be\navoided where possible. The gases listed in Table 17.1\nshould be monitored, and automatic alarms activated when\nthey exceed prescribed limit.\n\nAs the natural convection of gas as a result of buoyancy is\nsuppressed by the absence or reduced level of gravity, cabin\nair should be circulated to prevent uneven distribution of the\ngas species that are consumed or produced inside the space\ncabin. The species of concern are oxygen, carbon dioxide,\nand minor metabolites such as ketones, organic acids and\nesters. Forced circulation must sweep all the volume in the\ncabin without leaving stagnant areas. Gradients of concen-\ntration of gas species can form along the path of the venti-\nlation line. Ideally, cabin air should be sampled from each\ncompartment with due consideration of possible gradients of\nconcentration. The monitoring of major components (oxy-\ngen, carbon dioxide and humidity) is essential for house-\nkeeping of the life support functions. The SMAC gas species\ncan be analyzed by gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer\n(GC/MS), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR)\nand other analytical devices, which are tested and operated\n\non-board. Off-line analysis of trace species can also be\nconducted on the ground for detailed evaluation.\n\n17.1.2 Water Management\n\nWater is a critical resource for drinking, rehydration,\nhygiene, and medical use. On the Space Shuttle, the H2O2\nfuel cell system for electric power generation produced water\nas its byproduct. Electric power on-board the International\nSpace Station (ISS) is generated by solar cells. Since water is\nthe most heavily consumed item in life support, it is recycled\non the ISS at the rate of 3 kg per crewmember per day for\nphysiological needs, plus potentially another 26 kg per\ncrewmember per day for hygiene, flushing, laundry, and\ndishes. The palatability of this processed water is a critical\nfactor for crew psychology, and must be considered in the\nlife support engineering.\n\nWater quality is monitored on-board to check whether it\nmeets the requirements for potable water. The allowable\nlimits of inorganic elements and organics are summarized in\nTable 17.2. Current specifications by agencies such as\nNASA require microbial contamination to be less than 50\ncolony formation units (CFU) per millimeter for bacteria,\nand not detectable per 100 ml for coliform bacteria, fungus,\nand parasitic protozoa. Real-time monitoring should be\ndeployed on-board the spaceship for the defined pollutants\nand contaminants. If the analysis toolset is insufficient, then\ntotal organic carbon (TOC) represents the overall contami-\nnation level of water.\n\nMicrobial monitoring is routinely conducted by off-line\nanalysis of collected samples retrieved on the ground. An\nautonomous on-board system to identify microbial species\nand analyze their population size is being developed for\nmonitoring cabin cleanliness, whereby suspended bacteria\nare stained in a micro fluid device and detected by a fluo-\nrescence microscope. Biofilms often form inside water\nstorage systems, and can be a serious contamination source.\nIodine or silver ions are added to such systems as a biocide\nto suppress the growth of microbial populations. The con-\ncentrations of these chemicals should be continuously\nmonitored and kept within a defined range. Alternative anti-\nbacterial measures should be prepared for the possible\nmutation of resistant bacteria after long-term exposure to\nspace radiation.\n\n17.1.3 Illumination\n\nIllumination affects the visual perception of the crew when\nconducting tasks in the cabin and laboratory. The amount of\nlight and its color spectrum are important factors for the\npsychology and physiological performance of space crew.

Yamashita and R. M. Wheeler\n\n\n\na person is kept in complete darkness for a prolonged period,\nhis/her mental status is deeply depressed and harmed. White\nlight of an appropriate color temperature can be provided by\nelectric lamp, such as incandescent, fluorescent or light\nemitting diodes (LED). The luminance, power efficiency,\nand lifetime of lamps are engineering factors to be consid-\nered when designing lighting systems. The required mini-\nmum lighting level depends on the types of task to be\nperformed. For night lighting during the sleep period, the\nlight intensity is lowered.\n\nNatural sunlight can be introduced into the space cabin\nthrough windows, or through a solar light collecting system.\nSunbathing is one application of such a system. Strong light\nis an effective cue for maintaining normal circadian bio-\nrhythms. When natural sunlight is used for this purpose, the\nshorter ultraviolet (UV) portion should be filtered out, as it is\nby the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, to avoid harmful effects on the\ncrew. If the heat load must be suppressed, it is better to\nremove the infrared (IR) part of the light. Solar light col-\nlection system focuses incident sunlight into its light guide\nby either a lens or mirror. Color aberration of the lens and/or\ntransmittance qualities of the materials can remove harmful\nUV and IR rays, while allowing the visible light portion into\nthe space cabin, if the lens optics are adequately adjusted.\n\n17.1.4 Sound\n\nSound is a useful medium to perceive and gain information\nfrom the surroundings, and to communicate with other\n\ncrewmembers or ground personnel. The acoustic environ-\nment in a space cabin during the mission phase is moderate\ncompared to the noisy launch and descent periods. Even\nthough the sound pressure is less during the mission phase,\nannoying noises should be suppressed in the crew\u2019s living\ncabin both to avoid distraction during work tasks and to\nallow for better sleep and relaxation. The criteria for the\nsound environments are defined for the hearing frequency\nrange. However, both infrasonic and ultrasound noise can\ninduce indeterminate symptoms even when they are hard to\nhear. Ventilation fans and other mechanical and electrical\ndevices are possible sources of infrasonic noise and their\nacceptability should be carefully evaluated for crew health.\n\n17.1.5 Space Radiation\n\nThe space environment is discussed in detail in Chap. 3, and\nfrom a human effects perspective here.\n\n17.1.5.1 Characteristics of Space Radiation\nRadiation is categorized as either non-ionizing or ionizing.\nElectromagnetic waves from radio frequency to visible light\nare non-ionizing radiation, since their energy is insufficient\nto excite molecules to an ionized state. If the effects of\nradiation are limited to the deposit of thermal energy, ter-\nrestrial organisms can withstand a heat flux of 1 kW/m2,\nequivalent to the energy density of terrestrial incident solar\nlight. However, physiological responses other than thermal\neffects are possible for longer electromagnetic waves.\n\nFig. 17.2 EVA suit, a minimum-\nscale life support system.\nAstronaut Steven G. MacLean, of\nthe Canadian Space Agency,\nshown in the midst of a pre-\nbreathing exercise in the quest\nairlock of the International Space\nStation in preparation for an EVA\n(top left).

Consequently, the exposure limit\nfor electromagnetic waves is typically defined with reference\nto its frequency (Hz).\n\nShorter electromagnetic waves, such as UV, X-rays and\ngamma-rays, are capable of ionizing molecules by excitation\nabove the ionization threshold. Incident particles with energy\nsufficient to ionize molecules are also termed \u2018radiation\u2019.\nElectrons (beta-rays), neutrons, protons and other ionized\natomic nuclei, including helium nuclei (alpha-rays), are\nmajor components of this radiation. High-energy phenomena\nin the Sun and the Milky Way galaxy, which are not yet fully\nunderstood, emit energetic photons and can accelerate\ncharged particles. These are termed cosmic rays. On Earth\u2019s\nsurface, the thick atmosphere and the strong geomagnetic\n\nfield that deflects the trajectory of charged particles, reduce\nthe incidence of cosmic rays. Since those shielding mecha-\nnisms are not present in outer space, astronauts are directly\nexposed to the harsh space radiation. Space radiation is\ncharacterized by a high flux of energetic photons and heavy\nnuclei, which are rare on the Earth\u2019s surface. Nuclei with\nhigh atomic numbers (Z) and energy, mostly galactic in\norigin, are abbreviated as HZE.\n\nHigh energetic electrons and protons, major components\nof the solar wind, are trapped in the van Allen belts by the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field (see Chap. 3). As discussed in Chap. 4,\nan altitude of 300\u2013500 km is high enough to avoid the very\nworst drag caused by the residual atmosphere whilst also\nproviding some beneficial shielding from the residual atmo-\nsphere and remaining below the radiation belts. As such, for\ncrewed activities an altitude of 300\u2013500 km is preferred in\norder to limit the exposure of the crew to radiation.\n\nTable 17.1 Limits of common toxic gas species\n\nCompound Limit (mg/m3)\n\nMethanol 0.5\n\nEthanol 5\n\n2-Propanol 5\n\n2-Methyl-2-propanol 5\n\nN-butanol 5\n\nEthanal (acetaldehyde) 0.5\n\nBenzene 0.1\n\nXylenes 10\n\nMethyl benzene (toluene) 3\n\nDichloromethane 0.5\n\nDichlorodifluoromethance (Freon 12) 10\n\nChlorodifluoromethane (Freon 22) 5\n\nTrichlorofluoromethance (Freon 11) 10\n\n1,1,1-Trichloroethane 1\n\n1,1,2-Trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane (Freon 113) 5\n\nN-hexane 5\n\nN-pentane 10\n\nMethane 180\n\n2-Methyl-1,3-butadiene 10\n\nPropanone (acetone) 1\n\n2-Butane 3\n\nHydrogen 10\n\nCarbon monoxide 2\n\nHexamethylcyclotrisiloxane 10\n\nTrimethylsilanol 3\n\n2-Butoxyethanol 1\n\nTrifluorobromomethance (Halon 1301) 10\n\nCarbonyl sulfide 0.5\n\nAcetic acid 0.5\n\n4-Hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone 1\n\nTable 17.2 Potable water physiochemical limits [2]\n\nChemical Limit (mg/L)\n\nAmmonia 1\n\nAntimony 2\n\nBarium 10\n\nCadmium 0.022\n\nManganese 0.3\n\nNickel 0.3\n\nSilver 0.4\n\nTotal iodine 0.2\n\nZinc 2\n\nTotal organic carbon 3\n\nAcetone 15\n\nAlkylamines (di) 0.3\n\nAlkylamines (mono) 2\n\nAlkylamines (tri) 0.4\n\nBenzene 0.07\n\nCaprolactam 100\n\nChloroform 6.5\n\nDi (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate 20\n\nDi-n-butyl phthalate 40\n\nDichloromethane 15\n\nEthylene glycol 4\n\nFormaldehyde 12\n\nFormate 2,500\n\n2-Mercaptobenzothiazole 30\n\nMethanol 40\n\nMethyl ethyl ketone (MEK) 54\n\nPhenol 4\n\nn-Phenyl-beta-naphthylamine 260\n\n496 M.

Aside from thermal\neffects, radiation can cause chemical bonds to break and\nform free radicals, peroxides, and other species, which can\naffect biochemical processes in cells. The relative biological\neffectiveness (RBE) of cosmic rays is less known, but is an\nimportant factor in defining the exposure dose criteria for\ncrewed activities in space. A higher occurrence of double-\nstrand breaks in chromosomes is specifically caused by\nHZE. Radiation damage to cytoplasm and cellular organelles\nhas also been studied in microscopically controlled irradia-\ntion experiments.\n\nThe dose rate dependence is considered for the biological\neffects of radiation. Acute effects on human health are\ninduced at doses higher than 0.5 Sv, where the Sievert (Sv) is\na unit of dose to evaluate biological effects, 1 gray (Gy)\nmultiplied by RBE; the gray is a SI unit of dose measured by\nenergy deposit per unit mass. Radiation injury is caused\nstochastically even at a very low dosage. Taking ambiguity\nof scientific assessment into account, the radiation exposure\nlimit for the public is set by the International Commission on\nRadiological Protection (ICRP) to 1 mSv/year from artificial\nsources. However, it is noted that aircraft crew (and frequent\npassengers) who will spend many hours per year in the upper\ntroposphere, around 10 km altitude, can get an extra dose of\n[2 mSv/per year. The most serious risks to humans are\noncogenesis (or carcinogenesis) and genetic effects. Cell\ndamage from radiation is propagated to neighboring cells by\nthe diffusion of signal transmitters. This side effect, which\namplifies the number of damaged cells beyond that of the\ncells that are directly hit, results in a non-linear dose\ndependence at the low dosage end. On the other hand, there\nis a chance to repair damaged DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid)\nduring the cell cycle. This permits a higher integrated dos-\nage, if the dose rate is low enough to permit the functioning\nof the repair processes.\n\nRadiation dose rates in the ISS can average 1 mSv/day\nduring the calm period of solar activity. The natural radiation\ndose rate on the Earth\u2019s surface is typically 2.4 mSv/year,\nhowever sizeable population groups receive up to 10\u2013\n20 mSv/year. Biological systems are evolutionarily adapted\nto this natural dosage. Staying in the ISS far exceeds the\ninternational criteria for exposure: 50 mSv for one year, or\n100 mSv over 5 years. For astronauts, lifetime exposure\nlimits are 1,200 mSv for male astronauts, whose first space\nflight occurs after the age of 40 and 600 mSv for young\nfemale astronauts. There are no criteria for pregnant astro-\nnauts, since such cases would not be permitted. Intensive\ncrew health care and life-long monitoring might mitigate the\nhealth risk to astronauts. Epidemiological studies on com-\nmercial airline crews have shown they are exposed to a ten\ntimes higher dose of radiation during flights at an altitude of\n\n10 km, compared to people remaining on the ground.\nHowever, although skin and breast cancers are higher among\nairline crews, the total number of cancer cases is less than in\nthe control groups. This may be attributed to differences in\navailable health care.\n\nThe technology for monitoring radiation in space has\nbeen developed intensively in parallel with the development\nof human space flight. In addition to passive dosimetry such\nas plastic plate and thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD),\nreal time dosimetry is conducted in orbit. Phantom mea-\nsurement of a synthetic human body embedded with\ndosimeters is a key to assessing absorption coefficients of\nbiological tissue for space-specific radiation quality and for\nmapping the radiation dosage in each part of the body.\n\n17.1.5.3 Protective Measures Against Space\nRadiation\n\nThe radiation environment around Earth is largely domi-\nnated by solar activity. Charged particles, mainly protons,\nare accelerated by the magnetic reconnection formed over a\nsolar flare. Ejections of large numbers of accelerated parti-\ncles are called solar particle events (SPE). A high dosage, up\nto 1 Gy, is typical in a short period of a few days. By\nobserving activity on the Sun\u2019s surface, this ejection of dense\nenergetic particles can be predicted. Upon receiving a high-\nseverity SPE forecast alert, an EVA should be terminated and\nthe possibility of an emergency return to Earth should be\nconsidered. In moderate SPE events, crewmembers could\nhide in the most heavily shielded part of the space cabin.\n\nShielding is a general measure against space radiation.\nThe Earth\u2019s atmosphere is equivalent to a 10 m thick layer of\nwater shielding against radiation. The interaction of high-\nenergy particles with shielding materials generates a shower\nof secondary radiation, including fast neutrons. Such sec-\nondary radiation is one characteristic feature of space radi-\nation experienced inside the space cabin. An insufficient\nlayer of passive shielding materials results in numerous\nsmall damages spread over a wide area (\u2018shot gun\u2019), instead\nof one large localized area of damage (\u2018cannon\u2019); see\nFig. 17.3.\n\nSimilar to the shielding produced by the geomagnetic\nfield, active shielding is a concept of forming a strong\nmagnetic field or a steep electric field around a spaceship in\norder to deflect or decelerate incoming cosmic ray particles.\nIn addition to assessing the technical feasibility of building\nsuch a shielding field, any negative biological effects caused\nby this shielding field should be carefully evaluated. There\nare as yet few studies available on the health risks of a strong\nelectromagnetic field, but neural activities and early devel-\nopment are known to be affected by exposure.\n\nDevelopment of anti-radiation medication might be a\npromising approach. Extremophilic organisms are tolerant to\nvarious stresses including radiation. They possess molecular\n\n17 Habitation in Space 497\n\n\n\nmachinery to repair damaged chromosomes. Over-expres-\nsion of the repair-associated genes might effectively prevent\nand cure radiation damage. Suppression of oncogenesis\n(carcinogenesis) or enhancement of apoptosis for damaged\ncells may be another effective measure. Understanding the\nsystems biology of living cells regarding these phenomena is\ntherefore critical.\n\n17.1.6 Biological Environment\n\nOther living organisms are part of the space crew\u2019s envi-\nronment. Even when strong controls are applied to prevent\nbiological contamination of the cabin, the crew themselves\ncannot be sterilized and can therefore be a source of various\nmicroorganisms. Fungi and bacteria are found in the cabin,\neither airborne, in potable water, or on surfaces. Since sed-\nimentation does not occur under microgravity, airborne\nmicroorganisms become dominant in the space cabin.\nPathogenic bacteria, protozoa, and allergenic fungi spores\nshould be monitored and controlled within the allowable\n\nlimit. Fungi that proliferate on cabin surfaces and inside air\nducts may cause symptoms similar to Sick Building Syn-\ndrome. The space cabin system needs to be capable of dis-\ninfection and sanitization.\n\nProtection of our planet involves evaluating the risk\nposed by potential but presently unknown extraterrestrial\nliving creatures and organic compounds. Although such a\nrisk by its very nature can never be specific, it requires\nassessing the chance of extraterrestrial organisms being\ntransported to Earth and threatening terrestrial organisms and\nour ecology. However, extraterrestrial life and organic sub-\nstances are transported to Earth naturally as well; cosmic\ndust containing organic substance(s) is estimated to enter the\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere at 4 \u00b1 2 \u00d7 107 kg/year. The inclusion of\nextraterrestrial life in cosmic dust or larger bodies cannot be\nruled out. Certainly, space activities may increase the risk by\nshortening the travel time of extraterrestrial life, if any, and\nby protecting it from the harsh conditions otherwise expe-\nrienced during the ejection and entry phases. Fine regolith\nparticles brought into the space cabin after an EVA on an\nextraterrestrial body is recognized as a health risk, because\nof the highly active chemistry of such material.\n\n17.1.7 Fire Safety\n\nFire is a crucial safety issue that has the potential to end in\ncatastrophe. In order to prevent fire in the space cabin, the\nbuilding materials and contents should be manufactured\nfrom fire-retardant substances. Their ignition temperature\nshould be high, and any combustion should never propagate.\nThe oxygen concentration of cabin air is maintained below\n30 % to reduce the risk of fire propagation. Sources of hot\nspots and sparks should be carefully removed by design, and\nverified by testing. The toxic chemicals commonly produced\nby combustion can include carbon monoxide, hydrogen\ncyanide, and hydrogen chloride. In the fire detection system,\nforced airflow is needed to conduct (remove) these toxic gas\nspecies and smoke particles, because natural convection\ndoes not assist this detection under microgravity.\n\nShould fire occur, electric power to that portion of the\ncabin should be removed. Fire is extinguished by the use of\nnon-toxic chemicals that are appropriate for a confined\nenvironment. Any expended chemicals must be removed\nafter a fire has been extinguished. To meet these require-\nments, a combination of carbon dioxide and water-based fire\nextinguishers have been selected for use in space. During a\nfire, the affected compartment is isolated and evacuated, if\nthe criticality of the fire is high and a vacuum can be created\nto extinguish it. All compartments of the space ship must\nhave established escape routes to a safe location in the event\nof an emergency evacuation. Cabin design and the layout of\ncomponents must meet this safety requirement.\n\nFig. 17.3 Shower of secondary particles made by a high-energy\nparticle interaction\n\n498 M. Yamashita and R. M. Wheeler\n\n\n\n17.2 Materials Recycling\n\nThe space crew requires a continuous supply of life support\nconsumables, e.g., oxygen, water, food, and other items. At\nthe same time, the gaseous, liquid, and solid wastes that\naccumulate in the confined space cabin should be managed\nand processed adequately. For brief crewed space missions\nclose to Earth, life support consumables have been brought\nup to space, and wastes have been returned or dumped to\nEarth. For longer missions in low Earth orbit (LEO), such as\nMir and the International Space Station, physicochemical\nregenerative technologies have been used to recycle water\nfrom urine, since the penalty of increased mass is highest for\nwater in the open loop system. For future space missions\nbeyond LEO, such as interplanetary transit or outposts on\nextraterrestrial bodies, life support systems technology will\nhave to be more advanced. For longer mission durations and\ngreater distances from Earth, regenerative or materially\nclosed loop life support technologies will be essential.\nTable 17.3 summarizes typical input rates of materials for\nhuman life support, and output of waste products for one\nperson.\n\nRegenerative life support greatly reduces the costs of\nresupplying consumables. However, the initial investment to\nbuild the closed regenerative system and the costs for oper-\nating it for a defined mission period should be examined in\nterms of the economy of life support. For longer, larger, and\nmore widely ranging missions the estimated cost of regen-\nerative systems becomes cheaper than the total sum of con-\nsumables for the open loop life support systems. Resources\nrequired to operate and control the life support system are\nadditional factors in the trade-off between open and closed\nconcepts. There might be an optimum degree of closure, or a\ngood combination of the two. The \u2018economics\u2019 of life support\nsystems and their operation can be measured by the mass,\npower, volume, and crew time expended. The use of self-\nsustaining, regenerative technology would not only reduce\nthe costs of long-duration missions, but also reduce mission\nrisks by increasing the level of autonomy. However, the top\npriority and criteria for the engineering of life support sys-\ntems are robustness and survivability of the crew.\n\n17.2.1 Physicochemical Recycling Systems\n\nWaste regeneration by physicochemical processes is a well-\nestablished technology. From a systems engineering point of\nview, the system characteristics for physicochemical com-\nponents are better defined than those of biological elements.\nRecycling of water and oxygen has been accomplished by\nphysicochemical processes. A physicochemical regenerative\nsystem is shown in Fig. 17.4 [6].\n\n17.2.1.1 Water Recycling\nOn the ISS, much of the clean water is supplied from Earth.\nWater collected at the heat exchange condensers is also sent\nthrough the treatment steps including filtration. Urine is\neither chemically stabilized for storage and then dumped or\nreturned to ground, or it is sent to a distillation system. The\ndistillate water is then sent through filtration beds. The water\nproduced is treated with a biocide (silver) for potable water\nto reduce the risks of microbial contamination. Handling\nliquids like water under microgravity poses engineering\nchallenges, especially for separating gases from water. For\nsurface missions to the Moon or Mars, more conventional\nwater handling might be applicable under one-sixth and one-\nthird gravity, respectively.\n\nThe mass and power required for distillation of waste-\nwater ultimately needs to be reduced for water management\nin space. In principle, various approaches for water recycling\ncould be used, such as reverse osmosis filtration technology.\nWastewater containing urine is currently pretreated with\nstrong acids to prevent volatilization of ammonia and to\nreduce microbial activity. These acids pose a safety risk to\nthe crew, and alternative approaches should be considered\nfor stabilizing the urine. The use of biological pretreatment\nto oxidize organics to CO2 and convert nitrogenous com-\npounds to nitrate or N2 might be worth exploring. Further\nwork on the efficacy of alternative biocides for converting\nand maintaining potable water is a high priority if biological\ntreatment is included in the materials recycling system.\n\n17.2.1.2 Gas Regeneration\nConventional approaches to CO2 control in space cabin air\nare removal using strong alkaline reactants such as lithium\nhydroxide, and adsorption. Lithium hydroxide filters are\nlimited to one-time use, and must be replaced when con-\nsumed. Adsorption to molecular sieve (zeolite) or other\nadsorbents can be used repetitively after appropriate revi-\ntalization of the adsorbents by raising the temperature and/or\ndecreasing the pressure. Since both strong alkali and\nregenerative adsorbents for CO2 will absorb water vapor as\nwell, preprocessing is required to remove water from the\ncabin air before sending it to the CO2 adsorbent beds. This\nalso allows retrieval of water vapor for recycling. Water\nvapor on the ISS is also collected by heat exchangers that\noperate below the dew point of the cabin air. CO2 retrieved\nfrom adsorption beds is reduced by hydrogen in Sabatier\nprocessors, producing methane and water as reaction prod-\nucts. The methane is vented, while the water vapor can be\nrecycled. These CO2 reduction technologies are a step\ntoward increasing closure of the air regenerative loop, and\nthey provide an additional source of water. Another method\nis the Bosch process, a catalytic reaction of CO2 with\nhydrogen which produces carbon and water as its products.\n\n17 Habitation in Space 499\n\n\n\nOxygen (O2) is supplied from ground in the form of\neither compressed gas, or solid chemical oxygen generators,\ncalled oxygen candles. The solid O2 generators are typically\nkept for emergency situations, and consist of chlorate and\nperchlorate compounds. Electrolysis of water has been used\nto generate O2 on both Mir and the ISS. The hydrogen\nproduced by water electrolysis can then be supplied to the\nSabatier processor for reducing CO2, thereby further closing\nthe air and water recycling loop.\n\n17.2.1.3 Trace Contaminants and Dust Control\nSince space cabins and surface habitats are tightly closed\nenvironments, high concentrations of airborne trace con-\ntaminants or dust are accumulated. Because these can cause\nsafety and health problems, dust filters and activated carbon\nfilters have been used for most space vehicles. Some\n\ncontaminants are dissolved into water that is then condensed\non the heat exchangers, as well as the adsorbent used for\nCO2 removal. The technology for removing trace contami-\nnants in the water regeneration process is quite challenging.\nThermal catalysts are used on the ISS to oxidize (mineralize)\norganics to CO2 and water. This process effectively removes\nsmall organic molecules like methane and formaldehyde,\nwhich can be hard to remove by adsorption.\n\nIn order to reduce the energy requirements for the pro-\ncessing of trace contaminants, alternative concepts are being\nexamined, such as photocatalytic removal by titanium oxide\ncatalysts under UV radiation, and even biological filtration.\nIf filters for removal of dust and particulates can be regen-\nerated, it reduces the cost of life support. Novel approaches\nusing electrostatic principles may alternatively be applied for\nthis purpose.\n\nTable 17.3 Life support requirements for one person; taken from the space station ECLSS Architectural Control Document, NASA SPP 30262\n\nInputs Outputs\n\nDaily requirements\n(kg)\n\n% of total\nmass\n\nDaily requirements\n(kg)\n\n% of total\nmass\n\nOxygen 0.83 2.7 Carbon dioxide 1.00 3.2\n\nFood 0.62 2.0 Metabolic\nsolids\n\n0.11 0.35\n\nWater (drink and food preparation) 3.56 11.4 Water 29.95 96.5\n\nWater (hygiene, flush, laundry,\ndishes)\n\n26.0 83.9 Metabolic/\nurine\n\n12.3\n\nTotal 31.0 Hygiene/flush 24.7\n\nLaundry/dishes 55.7\n\nLatent 3.6\n\nTotal 31.0\n\nFig. 17.4 Physicochemical\nregenerative environmental\ncontrol and life support system\ndiagram\n\n500 M. Yamashita and R. M. Wheeler\n\n\n\n17.2.2 Biological and Ecological Systems\nfor Life Support\n\nThe use of biological and ecological systems in life support\nsystems, \u2018space agriculture\u2019, is an advanced concept for\nfuture missions with large crews and longer durations. The\necological system, in general, is composed of three com-\nponents: producer, consumer and decomposer organisms.\nHumans are the top consumer in agro-ecosystems. The main\nproducers are photosynthetic organisms, such as plants,\nwhich convert the energy of sunlight to a chemical form that\nis fixed in biomass. Plants in space agriculture can also act as\nwater distillers. Processed wastewater is irrigated, taken into\nthe plant body, and transpired from leaves. Decomposers in\nthe ecological system bridge the gap between consumers and\nproducers, and drive materials recycling. In the space agro-\necosystem, human waste and inedible biomass could be\ncomposted by bacteria, and used to fertilize the soil or irri-\ngation solutions with nutrients for farming more crop plants.\n\n17.2.2.1 Water and Gas Regeneration by Space\nAgriculture\n\nSupplying food, oxygen, and water for humans are the pri-\nmary demands of engineering for living in space. If no\nelement drops out of the recycling loop, the same amount of\nfood should be regenerated from the wastes. The regenera-\ntion loop produces oxygen in a stoichiometric relationship to\nthe biomass produced. When the scale of food production is\nlarge enough to provide more than 50 % of the crew\u2019s diet,\nall the metabolic CO2 produced by the crew is converted to\nO2 in sufficient amounts to provide for the physiological\nneeds of the crew. For water recycling, efficiencies may be\ngained by using the natural transpiration processes of plants.\nThe plant transpiration ratio is that between the amount of\nwater transpiration and photosynthetic fixation of energy\n(dry mass). The quantity of water that could be condensed\nfrom air in the farming area can be estimated from this ratio\nin ordinary crop plants. If food and oxygen produced by\nplants are to fill the requirements of the space crew, the\namount of water recovered from the air in the system would\ntypically exceed 200 L per person, which is close to daily\nconsumption by a person on the ground. However, plant\ntranspiration can be affected by the humidity and CO2\nconcentration of the surrounding air, varying the evaporative\ngradient and the resistant to water flux from the leaves.\n\nThe degree of closure of materials recycling has long\nbeen the index for engineering a controlled ecological life\nsupport system (CELSS), also termed either a closed eco-\nlogical life support system or a controlled environmental life\nsupport system. Space agriculture, like terrestrial agriculture,\nutilizes external resources available on the planetary body\nfor its operation. Water, carbon dioxide, and bio-elements\n\nare the natural resources for agriculture. Gathering some of\nthese in situ resources achieves more than 100 % closure, or\nin other words allows the disposal of some more recalcitrant\ncomponents, while maintaining a materials balance. This\nenlarges the scale of the materials recycling loop from the\ninitial inputs. This would be a form of in situ resource uti-\nlization (ISRU). As shown in Fig. 17.5, most of the required\nbio-elements are thought to be accessible on Mars. After\nspace agriculture has been established and matured, systems\nmight be expanded to even include trees to produce excess\noxygen and sequester carbon in the form of wood, which\ncould be used for living and habitat materials. Raising\ninsects that feed on tree leaves or other cellulosic materials\ncould further improve the efficiency of biomass use by\nproviding protein rich foods.\n\n17.2.2.2 Agro-Ecological Systems for Space Life\nSupport\n\nSelection of crop species is a fundamental step in designing\nspace agriculture systems. Food materials and species should\nbe selected to meet the nutritional requirements for healthy\nliving, as described in Sect. 17.3.1. As the volume available\nfor agricultural production in space is limited, and is a pre-\ncious resource of space habitation, maximizing the yields of\ncrops per unit area/volume per unit time is a high priority.\nThe survivability of the crew will be greatly dependent on\nthe robustness of crop growth and production. Toughness,\nincluding environmental resilience and pathogen resistance\nof agricultural plants, is also important for life support on a\ndistant planet. Figure 17.6 shows one selection of food crops\ndesigned under these guidelines. This menu fills the nutri-\ntional needs for metabolic energy, dietary fiber, proteins and\nlipids (Fig. 17.7).\n\nConsidering the harsh conditions in space, a phased\nstrategy to initiate agriculture is proposed. In order to develop\nthis scenario, the trade-off between hydroponics and soil-\nbased agriculture should be assessed during the various\nphases of development and integration of space agriculture.\nDuring the early phase, life support capability might be\nprovided by a combination of the physicochemical systems\nand plant hydroponics, where the plants are only providing\nhigh-value supplemental or perishable foods. Hydroponics is\nrobust because nutrient composition, dissolved oxygen level\nand other environmental factors for plant roots are strongly\ncontrolled. Composting of inedible biomass might then be\nused to gradually generate soils to support expanded agri-\nculture. There are pros and cons for both hydroponics and\nsoil-based farming. One advantage of using soil is the sym-\nbiosis between plants and microorganisms of the soil eco-\nsystem, which often assist plant roots in obtaining essential\nelements to create a positive environment for plant growth.\nThe soil ecology of bacteria, fungi, and other living organ-\nisms has been studied along with the physical and chemical\n\n17 Habitation in Space 501\n\n\n\nproperties of soil. Such knowledge provides a fundamental\nbasis for initiating soil-based space agriculture [7].\n\nThe physiology of plants under micro- or partial gravity is\nanother important subject to be studied for the engineering of\nspace agriculture. Plants respond to gravity in two ways.\nThey sense the gravity vector and develop their structures\nand orient their growth through gravitropism, also known as\ngeotropism. They also respond to the magnitude of gravity\nby hardening cell walls to sustain their own body weight.\nCellular mechanisms for both gravitropism and the gravi-\nresistance reaction are active research subjects in gravita-\ntional biology. In the absence of gravity, or under reduced\ngravity, tropisms induced by factors other than gravity, such\nas light and humidity, become more important. Since light is\na governing factor for photosynthesis, it affects plant phys-\niology in many ways. For some plant species, lighting and\nthe length of day/night cycle should be controlled according\nto the photoperiodism that determines the timing of flower\nbud development and storage organ formation.\n\nAs with the cabin air, atmospheric pressure and compo-\nsition in the farming section do not need to be the same as\nthe air on Earth. As with the space habitat, lower pressures in\nfarming modules will reduce the burden on the mechanical\nstructure and reduce gas leakage. Limits of gas pressure and\ncomposition for farming plants have been examined in this\ncontext. The lower limit of oxygen for most plant species is\nprobably near 10 kPa. An optimal range of carbon dioxide\npartial pressure is perhaps 100\u2013200 Pa for C3 plants.\n\n1 Above\nthis level, the photosynthetic reaction is saturated. On the\nother hand, transpiration water-use could increase [8]. And\n\nof course human performance can be negatively affected at\nvery high CO2 partial pressures, which would have impli-\ncations for humans tending the crops. Water vapor is another\nminor gas component that must be controlled for the tran-\nspiration of plants, because the water vapor pressure differ-\nential between the air and the leaves has a direct effect on\ntranspiration rates. In a confined environment, the accumu-\nlation of bioactive substances must also be considered, if\nnatural decomposition does not occur in the space agro-\necosystem. Ethylene gas is a particular concern, because it\nfunctions as a plant hormone that promotes flowering and\nripening but can be harmful in higher concentrations. Eth-\nylene can be removed by catalytic oxidation and possibly\nalso through biological methods.\n\nHeat and mass transfer phenomena change in exotic\nenvironments, such as reduced atmospheric pressure, dif-\nferent atmospheric composition, and micro- or partial grav-\nity. The microclimate around plant bodies is modified under\nthese condition, and affects plant physiology in several ways.\nNatural convective heat and mass transfer driven by buoy-\nancy is greatly suppressed under microgravity. This induces\noverheating of plant body parts, and suppresses gas\nexchange in the leaf. Diffusion of oxygen molecules is\nboosted under reduced pressure. These effects can be offset\nby maintaining adequate, forced air circulation throughout\nthe plant production area. Oxygen, CO2, water vapor and\nother gas movements are increased at reduced pressure. A\ncommon observation from reduced pressure studies with\nplants is an increase in transpiration rates, although some\nplants may be able to adjust their transpiration rates as they\nacclimate to different pressures.\n\nFor the production of better quality entomophilous plant\nspecies, pollinator animals should be introduced. The flight\ncapabilities of pollinator insects need to be confirmed under\npartial gravity and reduced atmospheric pressure, where both\n\nFig. 17.5 Concept of space\nagriculture for habitation on\nMars. If in situ resources are\nemployed it is possible to make\nthe system more than 100 %\nrecyclable\n\n1 Together with C4 carbon fixation and Crassulacean acid metabolism,\nalso known as CAM photosynthesis, C3 carbon fixation is a metabolic\npathway for photosynthesis, converings carbon dioxide and ribulose\nbisphosphate (RuBP, a 5-carbon sugar) into 3-phosphoglycerate.\n\n502 M. Yamashita and R. M. Wheeler\n\n\n\nthe fluid dynamics and lift force requirements differ from\nthose on Earth. Adjustments of lift and thrust for flight\nmaneuvers are made by commanding the muscles that con-\ntrol the attack angle or stroke trajectory of the wing motion.\n\nFlight maneuvering of insects is controlled by visual sensory\ninformation. In parabolic flight experiments, bumblebees\nwere able to handle the equivalent of gravity on Mars, but\nhad difficulty under lunar conditions. Alternatively,\n\nFig. 17.6 Model foods to satisfy\nthe daily nutritional requirements\nfor one person: rice (300 g),\nsoybean (100 g), sweet potato\n(200 g), green-yellow vegetable\n(komatsuna) (300 g), silkworm\npupae reared on mulberry leaves\n(50 g), loach fish co-cultured in\nrice paddies (120 g), and sodium\nsalt (3 g)\n\nFig. 17.7 Cosmonaut Yuri I.\nMalenchenko, expedition 16\nflight engineer representing\nRussia\u2019s Federal Space Agency,\nchecks the progress of pea plants\ngrowing in the Russian Lada\ngreenhouse in the Zvezda service\nmodule of the ISS. Image NASA\n\n17 Habitation in Space 503\n\n\n\nparthenocarpic or self-pollinating crops might be selected or\ndeveloped for space applications. Besides pollination, rais-\ning animals may eventually become a necessary part of a\nspace agriculture in order to fill the crew\u2019s nutritional needs\nfor animal-origin food substances, as there are several\nnutrients that are difficult to obtain from plant-only diets;\ninsects and fish are candidates for this supply.\n\nSeveral species of insects have been proposed for the\nspace diet. Silkworms, a well-established domesticated\ninsect species, convert inedible mulberry leaves to edible\nmaterials; shown in Fig. 17.6. Among many fish species that\ncan be bred, the tilapia and loach fish have been suggested.\nCo-culture of loach and rice is done in many places. Loach is\na robust fish species. It gulps air into its digestive tube and\nexpels it from its anus after exchanging oxygen and carbon\ndioxide through its gut. During the winter dry-up season\nwhen rice paddies lose their water, loach fish dive deep into\nthe mud until spring. Furthermore, loach has a high nutri-\ntional value. A model diet with loach fish added to the\nselection of vegetables and insect could meet most nutri-\ntional requirements.\n\n17.2.3 Waste Management\n\n17.2.3.1 Solid Waste Management\nTo date, solid waste management has involved either con-\nsolidating or stabilizing solid waste and then dumping it to\nspace, or returning it to Earth. This waste includes packaging\nmaterials, disposable clothes, food waste, and human meta-\nbolic wastes. Such wastes represent a potential source of\nodors and microbial pathogens. In order to reduce these\nrisks, the waste can be dewatered and sealed with meltable\nplastics into inert disks or bricks. With the aim of recycling\nthis waste, super-critical wet oxidation has been intensively\nstudied. Organic substances are easily decomposed and\noxidized by this method. However, the high power\nrequirement and the handling of high pressures and tem-\nperatures are the major drawbacks of super-critical wet\noxidation (Fig. 17.8).\n\n17.2.3.2 Composting to Recycle Bio-Elements\nSolid waste is a potential resource for space habitation and\nfarming. The stabilized material might serve as a radiation\nshield, or produce mineralized compost for farming. This\nmineralization could be performed by physicochemical\nincineration with wet oxidation, or biological oxidation with\nmicrobes. One approach for partial recycling of minerals\nwould be to treat solid wastes in aerobic or anaerobic stirred\ntank bioreactors, after which the nutrient rich effluent could\nbe sent on to crops for food and O2 production [9]. A more\npromising approach uses hyper-thermophilic aerobic com-\nposting. It is based on fermentation under high temperatures\n\nand aerobic conditions. This new composting system oper-\nates at a higher temperature than an ordinary anaerobic\ncomposting system. Bacteria in the hyper-thermophilic\ncomposter are active and viable at temperatures of 100 \u00b0C or\neven higher. This type of composting has a faster processing\nrate because of the rapid aerobic-type metabolic pathway,\nand a faster chemical reaction rate at the higher temperature.\n\nBiological combustion releases heat and raises the tem-\nperature of the reaction bed, when air is force fed through it.\nSince microbial activity declines at higher temperatures (e.\ng., above 65\u2013100 \u00b0C), the temperature in the reacting bed is\nnaturally regulated to within its optimum range. Such natural\nregulation is effective if the volume of the reaction bed is\nlarge compared to its surface area. The ecology of this\ncomposting bacterial system is structured with an intensive\nsymbiotic network formed among multiple species. There\nhave been several terrestrial demonstrations of recycling\nessential nutrients (elements) from solid wastes back to plant\nproduction systems in the chemical forms accessible by plant\nroots. For this uptake, soil bacteria and arbuscular mycor-\nrhizal fungi are important members of the symbiotic ecology\nin soil. Such an ecology is a primary advantage of soil-based\nagriculture.\n\nFor fertilization of crop plants, nitrogen in organic com-\npounds is converted to ammonium ions through hyper-\nthermophilic aerobic fermentation. Organic nitrogen, typi-\ncally amino or heterocyclic bio-chemicals, is either con-\nverted to ammonium or remains in an undigested form in the\ncompost. The fate of phosphate in hyper-thermophilic aer-\nobic composting has not yet been described in detail,\nalthough calcium phosphate precipitates have been found in\nreactors. The dropout rate of fertilizer elements in the recy-\ncling loop should be carefully examined to keep the degree\nof closure high. Potassium is the last of the three major\nmacro-elements in fertilizer. Ring cavity structures formed in\nclay minerals can enclose potassium ions, which interact\nwith the oxygen atoms surrounding the rim of the cavity.\nThe high affinity of potassium ions for such sites, which\noriginates in the interaction between the ions and oxygen\natoms at the rim of the cavity, may function as a means of\nstoring potassium to provide resistance to wash-out during\nwatering.\n\nSpace agro-ecosystems may become saline as human\nwastes such as urine are increasingly processed in the\nmaterials recycling loop. This increased salinity can stress\nthe crops and reduce productivity. Humans require sodium to\nmaintain body fluid content, and any excess sodium is\nexcreted in urine. Sodium should be separated, or reduced\nfrom the compost and fertilizer, in order to prevent a\nreduction of plant productivity. This can be a challenge\nwhile trying to retrieve nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus and\nother useful minerals from the waste stream. Several\napproaches have been proposed to solve this sodium\n\n504 M. Yamashita and R. M. Wheeler\n\n\n\nproblem in space agriculture. One approach would be to use\nphysicochemical processes for separating the two elements,\nsuch as electrodialysis or struvite precipitation. The differ-\nence in temperature dependence on solubility of sodium and\npotassium salts could also be utilized to separate them by\nchanging the temperature to drive the dissolution and pre-\ncipitation cycle. Alternatively, biological processes might be\nable to partition sodium from potassium and other useful\nelements. One candidate technology for this purpose is the\ncultivation of marine algae to harvest potassium and other\nbio-elements from the medium, and increase the sodium\ncontent in artificial seawater. Another possible approach is\nthe selection of salt tolerant halophytes as agricultural plant\nspecies.\n\n17.2.3.3 Planetary Protection\nWhen planning space missions to extraterrestrial bodies for\nastrobiological surveys, not contaminating them with ter-\nrestrial organisms or organic substances will have to be a\nmission priority. COSPAR, the international Committee on\nSpace Research, has a review panel that assesses proposed\nmission plans under the consensus of space science. By this\nregulation, organic waste cannot be dumped from any\nspacecraft flying to Mars, or any other bodies that are of\ninterest in terms of astrobiology. Hyper-thermophilic aerobic\nbacteria might be used to help to conserve the extraterrestrial\nenvironment for astrobiology exploration. The accumulated\norganic waste can be quickly composted with hyper-ther-\nmophilic aerobic bacteria, yielding a sterilized product.\nEventually, EVAs will end up contaminating the surrounding\nareas of a surface outpost. For such future missions, the\n\ntarget planets or bodies might be partitioned into safe or no-\ntravel zones for humans in order to preserve their pristine\nnature. The issue of planetary protection will be discussed\nfurther in Chap. 23, while Table 17.4 details proposed cat-\negories for solar system bodies [10].\n\n17.3 Life Management in Space\n\nThe daily life of the space crew requires more than just\nbiological life support inside the cabin. Even when crew-\nmembers are highly motivated to achieve the objectives of\ntheir mission, quality of life management enhances their\nproductivity. Such management includes a wide range of\nitems for achieving a fully balanced, healthy, and civilized\nlifestyle in space.\n\n17.3.1 Food\n\nIn current missions to LEO space stations, food is stowed and\nresupplied from the ground at regular intervals. Fresh fruits\nand vegetables are delivered by cargo flights to the ISS, but\nconsumed within days. Small-scale production of vegetables\nand other crops has been tested in space. However, larger\nscale crop-production systems for space life support will\nrequire solving complex integration challenges. The pro-\nduction of supplemental vegetables and other foods is the\nstarting point for designing a space life support system [11].\nThe preferred selections of food materials are largely influ-\nenced by the backgrounds and food cultures of the crews.\n\nFig. 17.8 The European\nAutomated Transfer Vehicle\n(ATV,) ISS supply spacecraft, is\nalso used to dispose of solid\nwaste. Shown are ATV-3, also\nknown as \u2018Edoardo Amaldi\u2019,\ninternal close-out photographs\nand it\u2019s fiery plunge through\nEarth\u2019s atmosphere and\ndestructive reentry. Image ESA\n(left) and NASA (right)\n\n17 Habitation in Space 505\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_23\n\n\n17.3.1.1 Nutrition Requirements\nFood provides a source of metabolic energy in the chemical\nform of molecules, fills the need for turnover of body, and\nsupplements important substances for biochemical processes\nwhich cannot be synthesized in our body. Nutritional\nrequirements are listed in Tables 17.5 and 17.6.\n\nHumans are heterotrophic organisms and can oxidize\ncarbohydrate, fat, or protein by oxygen to gain metabolic\nenergy at a rate of about 100 W (roughly 2,000 kcal/day).\nThis energy demand depends on body size, age, sex, and\nactivity. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the synthesis of\nenergy to maintain fundamental body functions. Maximum\nmetabolic rate (MMR) is the BMR plus all neural and\nmuscular work. Metabolic substrates (carbohydrates, fats\nand proteins) and pathways are used to meet physiological\nneeds and condition.\n\nProteins and other constituents are required for the turn-\nover of body tissue. The composition and amount of amino\nacids is important because an excess intake of protein results\nin the overload of urea-related metabolic waste in the liver\nand kidneys. Of the 20 amino acids needed for human\nnutrition, nine cannot be synthesized in the human body, and\ntheir intake from the diet is critical. The amino acid score is\nan index to evaluate the quality of amino acids composition.\n\nVitamins and other minor elements support health by\nsupplementing nutrients that cannot be synthesized in our\nbody. There are several general rules of thumb to guide the\nchoice of foods to fill our nutritional requirements. One rule\nis the ratios of carbohydrate, protein, and fat necessary to\nmeet the energy intake. Another is the recommended ratio of\nanimal- and plant-origin proteins to optimize the amino acids\nscore close to 100. Since carbohydrate and protein are\nhydrolyzed to smaller molecules of sugar and amino acid\nprior to their absorption through the intestinal cell mem-\nbrane, the choice of animal- or plant-origin material is not\nessential for human nutrition. In many plant-origin foods,\nlysine is deficient. A combination of plant and animal sub-\nstances solves this problem. In contrast to protein, animal-\nand plant-based fats and oils are different at their molecular\nlevel. Cholesterols are fatty acids found in animals but not in\nplants. A certain amount of cholesterols should be taken to\nkeep the immune system functioning normally.\n\nAn example of how to improve crew health through food\nselection is to include foods with sufficient dietary fiber to\nkeep the intestinal flora healthy. Also beneficial for this\npurpose are probiotics, which promote the ecology of intes-\ntinal microorganisms, such as populations of lactic acid\nbacteria. Space foods, at present, are sterilized and stabilized\nfor long-term storage. For securing the shelf life of food,\nfermented foods like yogurt or pickles, which contain live\nbacteria, are not currently included in the space menu. Longer\ncrewed missions should consider including probiotics in the\nmenu, or feeding seed bacteria to establish healthy gut flora.\n\nAn additional consideration for nutrition specific to space\ncrews relates to their intensive work associated with EVAs.\nMineral loss from bone under micro- or partial gravity may\nbe offset by taking supplemental Vitamin D, which also\nsuggests that astronauts should be exposed to some minimal\namount of UV light from time to time in order to sustain\ngood Vitamin D nutrition. Although living in space is highly\nstressful in many aspects, the physical load during body\nmovement is less under microgravity than on Earth. This\nfactor should be taken into account when defining the\nnutritional requirements, and should avoid excess intake of\nenergy.\n\n17.3.1.2 Foods Storage and Cooking\nAlthough fresh foods are supplied periodically to the ISS\ncrew by cargo vehicles, most food is stored on-board for a\nlong time. A shelf life of over one year at room temperature\nis the criterion for storage of food on the ISS. Microbial\ncontrol measures are used in food preparation while trying to\nminimize any negative effects on the taste and texture. Foods\ncan be stored either in metal cans or plastic packaging with\nlow oxygen permeability. Oxidation accelerates food spoil-\nage, and the chance of aerobic bacterial contamination is\nincreased by the entry of permeated oxygen.\n\nThermo-stabilization, irradiation, and freeze\u2013drying are\ncommon processes for preparing space food and for main-\ntaining its quality throughout the mission period. Thermo-\nstabilization kills pathogenic and food-spoiling bacteria.\nEnzymes that impair the taste of food are also deactivated by\nhigh temperatures. Of the three processes, irradiation is a\nnewer technology for food processing. Gamma-rays, X-rays,\nor electrons irradiate it at energies too low to produce\nradioactive isotopes. However, irradiated food is not fully\naccepted by the general public in many countries. The safety\nof irradiated food should be verified in terms of toxicity,\noncogenesis, and the hereditary risk caused by probable\nreaction products of irradiation. Safety testing of irradiated\nfoods after cooking or packaging is fairly new. Freeze-dried\nitems and long shelf life bread have low water activity that is\neffective in suppressing microbial proliferation (Table 17.7).\n\nFood and drinks are prepared on the ISS in its galley.\nFreeze\u2013dried items are rehydrated in their plastic pouch with\nhot water, and canned or retort-packed food is warmed up in\nan electric oven similar to those that equip in the galley of a\ncommercial passenger airplane. Cold beverages are also\nprepared using cold water supplied in the galley.\n\nDining is a highly social activity for humans. The menu\nshould be structured with a variety of items and cooking\nmethods to maximize palatability. For longer space missions,\ncooking will become one of the joys of space habitation\n[12]. Cooking facilities must meet safety regulations, and,\nmoreover, fit into the space environment, such as micro- or\npartial gravity and reduced total pressure of cabin air.\n\n506 M. Yamashita and R. M.

A person\u2019s height increases due to the spine\nlengthening in space. A shift in body fluid deforms\n(increases) the size of the chest and waist and decreases the\nsize of the lower limbs. Neutral (resting) body posture differs\nfrom that under normal gravity, as shown in Fig. 17.11. The\nform of clothes is stabilized by the action of gravity on the\nground. Clothing design in space should consider the\nabsence of this effect. Altered heat and mass transfer under\nmicro- or partial gravity is another factor to be considered\nwhen designing fabric.\n\nThe ISS has no laundry machine on-board, and the fre-\nquency of washing clothes is limited during a mission. The\nchoice of surfactant for washing clothes should meet the\nconstraints of the water revitalization system. Since most space\nclothes are disposable, the frequency of change determines the\ntotal quantity of clothes to be carried up. A daily change of\nunderwear and workout clothes, and a weekly change of other\nclothing is the average frequency favored by crews. Functional\nfabrics and textiles are developed with a catalytic functional\nlayer coated on the fibers to suppress odors.\n\n17.3.3 Space Architecture\n\nSpace architecture is the practice of designing and building\nliving environments for human activities in space. All items\nand subsystems that interface with the crew are the subject of\nspace architecture. Its practice has two main components.\nOne is to manage the unique environment of space and its\nconstraints on habitation. The second is to find ways to\nhumanize space systems and make them compatible with\nand user-friendly to crews.\n\nSpace cabin architecture needs to provide air circulation\nand illumination according to the requirements described\nearlier in this chapter. The layout and orientation of\n\ncomponents in the living and working sections should be\nconsistent in terms of their vertical axis. A reversal of top\nand bottom between systems or areas induces confusion in\nthe central nervous system, and causes space motion sick-\nness. Providing visual cues to indicate vertical orientation,\nsuch as the contrast of light and dark colors for top and\nbottom, is effective in preventing such sickness. Figure 17.7\nshows small portholes in the nadir face of the ISS that also\nserve to reinforce the sense of top and bottom.\n\nFor longer missions, psychology becomes an important\nfactor in architectural design and in the choice of interior\nmaterials. Rather than plastics and metals, natural materials\nsuch as wood may be preferable for those items with which\nthe crew directly interface. However, all proposed materials\nand architectural design might be subjected to the safety\ncontrol of space systems. Escape routes and passages should\nbe securely cleared in case offire or other catastrophic events.\n\nThe crew quarters are a compartment for sleep and pri-\nvacy, although minimally sized.

However, this is counterbalanced by\nthe psychological benefit of being able to view outer space\nand the home planet. Among space crews, rank hierarchies\nand leader\u2013follower relationships are formed. Space archi-\ntecture can reinforce the stability of this group structure, by\nhaving the layout of crew quarters and other items ordered\nby rank (Figs. 17.12, 17.13).\n\nHygiene and other items of daily life are managed by the\nspace architecture design as well. Space toilets separate urine\nand feces for water regeneration and storage prior to\ndumping or composting. These are facilities and tools for\nshaving, hair cutting, tooth brushing, hand washing, and\nbathing. All of these capabilities must be integrated with\nsolid and liquid waste handling systems, either for stabil-\nization and storage, or for recycling and loop closure for\nfuture missions.\n\n17.3.4 Medical Support\n\nA major question asked during the early era of space flight\nwas whether humans could sustain life in outer space\nwithout major health problems. This issue is not yet fully\nresolved. Of the many factors in the space environment,\nresearch has focused on gravity and its compounding effects\nwith other factors such as space radiation. In space, gravity\ncan be handled as an experimental parameter for periods\nlong enough to produce biological effects. Experimental\nresults to date indicate that microgravity does not cause\ngenetic instability. Extensive studies have been conducted to\nclarify the direct or secondary effects of gravity. Its actions\nhave been surveyed in the several hierarchical levels of\nliving systems, i.e., cell, organ and whole body. Based on\nthose space-specific findings, medical support is provided\nfor astronauts.\n\nTable 17.7 Types of food and packaging for space flight [2]\n\nFood/packaging type ISS/Space shuttle example Parameters\n\nThermostabilized Beef stew\n\nYogurt\nPudding\nSoup\nTuna casserole\nRed beans and rice\n\nShelf life: 3\u20135 years\nPackaging: quad-laminate pouch\nPreparation: none or heating\n\nIrradiated Beef brisket, fajitas\nBroiled lamb\nFresh fruit\nRaw vegetables\n\nShelf life: 2\u20135 years\nPackaging: quad-laminate pouch\nPreparation: none or heating\n\nRehydratable vegetables Chicken salad\nCornbread dressing\nSausage patty\nShrimp cocktail\n\nShelf life: 1.5 years with overwrap; 1 year with no overwrap\nPackaging: combitherm pouch, adapter for rehydration\nPreparation: rehydration using hot water\n\nNatural form cookies Brownies\nNuts\nGranola bars\n\nShelf life: 1.5 years with overwrap; 1 year with\nno overwrap\nPackaging: combitherm pouch\nPreparation: none\n\nExtended-shelf-life bread products Dinner rolls\nWaffles\nScones\nTortillas\n\nShelf life: 1 year\nPackaging:\nPreparation: None\n\nFresh food Fresh fruit\nRaw vegetables\nTortillas\n\nShelf life: 1 week\nPackaging:\nPreparation: None\n\nBeverages Freeze-dried (coffee or tea)\nDrink mix (lemonade)\nWater\n\nShelf life: 1.5 years\nPackaging: tri-laminate pouch, adapter for rehydration, straw\nPreparation: rehydration using hot or cold water\n\n17 Habitation in Space 509\n\n\n\n17.3.4.1 Human Physiology in Space\nThrough the evolutionary history of living organisms on\nEarth, the human body and its physiological features have\nbecome well adapted to the planetary environment. Once the\nhuman body is exposed to microgravity, adaptation to the\nnew environment starts. Neurophysiology related to gravi-\nperception changes after a transition to microgravity. Sen-\nsory inputs from vestibular organs, eyes, and somatic senses\nare integrated in the brain to recognize body orientation and\ncontrol posture. Space motion sickness (SMS) is often\nreported during the first few days in space, and is thought to\n\nbe induced by confusion in this sensory integration process.\nBody fluids shift from the lower limbs to the upper body\nunder microgravity. The cardiovascular system adapts to the\nspace environment too. Motor function changes in response\nto the absence of mechanical load on the muscles that would\notherwise be counteracting gravity. The muscle fibers are\ngradually modified to fast-twitch type muscle fiber, and\noverall muscle tissue atrophies. Continuous bone deminer-\nalization is a critical risk of longer duration space flights.\nEach of these adaptations happens over a different time span,\nand some are irreversible even after return to Earth.\n\nFig. 17.9 Astronauts Shane\nKimbrough and Sandra Magnus,\nboth STS-126 mission specialists,\nare pictured with fresh fruit\nfloating freely on the middeck of\nSpace Shuttle Endeavour during\nflight day three activities.

Yamashita and R. M. Wheeler\n\n\n\nThe action of gravity on early developmental processes has\nbeen carefully examined with several animal models, but is\nnot yet completely understood.\n\n17.3.4.2 Health Monitoring and Medication\nCrew health status is monitored both on-board and remotely\nfrom the ground at a certain interval during normal opera-\ntion, and continuously during critical operation. Preventive\nhealth care is conducted by diagnosis of routine exams, such\nas blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG). Crew-\nmembers are periodically interviewed by a flight surgeon on\nthe ground for consultation on medical and psychological\nissues.\n\nThe crew health care system (CHeCS) on-board the ISS\nconsists of the health maintenance system (HMS), environ-\nmental health system (EHS), and countermeasures system\n(CMS). Blood samples are analyzed with a clinical chem-\nistry kit. Saliva samples are also collected for analysis.\n\nPharmacological countermeasures to SMS involve a drug\nthat selectively modifies the related neural activities. To\nprevent bone mineral loss, an effective drug is prescribed for\nspace crew. In addition, physical exercise can prevent some\nmuscle atrophy, if it is caused mainly by disuse, and there\nare no major direct effects of gravity on cellular processes.\nThe crew is provided with physical exercise protocols and\nequipment such as a treadmill, cycle ergometer, and resistive\nexercise device. By applying compression force to skeletal\nbones, demineralization or remodeling is suppressed at a\ncertain level. Orthostatic intolerance after return to Earth is\n\nstill an unsolved problem in space medicine. Lower body\nnegative pressure (LBNP) and oral fluid loading is pre-\nscribed to increase total body fluid, just prior to return to\nEarth. As noted earlier, long-term exposure to space radia-\ntion is still a challenge for crew health, and medications for\ncountering radiation effects are still in the research phase.\n\nThe medical facility for therapeutic operation provides\nthe capability to administer hypodermic and intravenous\ninjection. Medical risks that cannot be well evaluated before\nlaunch are ranked by severity. Two high risks, which require\nsurgery without delay, are appendicitis and heavy or trau-\nmatic injury. A crew medical restraint system (CMRS) is\nprepared on-board, together with surgical tools. A defibril-\nlator is also available for heart attacks. The handling of a\ndeceased crewmember\u2019s body is another integrated function\nthat must be considered, especially for long-duration mis-\nsions. It is not realistic to include a medically licensed\ncrewmember on the team in all missions, and even medical\npersonnel find it difficult to cover every field of medicine.\nTelemedicine has been identified as a key technology for\nsuch situations. Medical experts can help to diagnose con-\nditions and prescribe medication remotely, thereby easing\nthe burden on the crew.\n\n17.3.5 Human Factors and Psychological\nSupport for Space Exploration\n\nThe crew is the core component of any human space system,\nbut human factors are the most difficult to define in systems\n\nFig. 17.11 Neutral body posture\nunder microgravity [2]\n\n17 Habitation in Space 511\n\n\n\nengineering. Human factors should be properly handled in\norder to ensure mission success. Social psychology is a\ndominant factor in the success of prolonged duration space\nmissions. In addition to the harsh physical factors of the\nspace environment, psychological stressors for astronauts are\nisolation from their home, absolute confinement in a narrow\ncabin surrounded by the vacuum of space, the danger of the\nmission as a whole, the heavy workload, and the monotony\nof life during a mission. Personal behavior and productivity\nare definitely influenced by an astronaut\u2019s psychological\nstate.\n\nCrew team performance is largely affected by interper-\nsonal relations among crewmembers, and group dynamics\nare key to maximizing the morale and productivity of a crew.\nGroup structure, the composition of crew, and leader/fol-\nlower relationships are important subjects to be examined. In\nthe short term, heterogeneity among team members, such as\ngender, career experience, language and cultural back-\nground, does not give positive effects. After the acceptance\nof differences by each crewmember, however, the diversity\namong space crew is a positive feature in interpersonal\nrelations. Gender of space crew has been treated as a\n\nFig. 17.12 Design of sleep areas\nand crew quarters. a Crew\nquarters in microgravity. Minimal\nroom for sleeping, working, and\nrest, which are all done in the\nsame space for short to medium\nduration missions. b Partial-\ngravity crew quarters. Large\nvolume for long-duration\nmissions. Working, sitting,\nstanding, and sleeping combined\nwith hygiene, stowage, and waste\nmanagement\n\n512 M. Yamashita and R. M. Wheeler\n\n\n\nsensitive issue, and is certainly important. Cultural differ-\nences associated with gender can be understood in the\ncontext of the evolution of social behavior of humans.\nDepending on the cultural background, women in a mixed-\ngender group can take on a socio-emotional role, instead of\nadopting a highly competitive attitude in a task-oriented\nteam. Between same aged members of both sexes, rivalry\nand harassment are likely to be serious problems under\nstressful conditions [13]. Nevertheless, in all cases there can\nbe substantial variation among individuals.\n\nPsychological support for crews who are confined and\nisolated in a spaceship becomes an essential part of life\nmanagement for interplanetary travel, which is characterized\nby a longer mission period, extreme isolation, and physical\ndistance from home. Broad studies in the field of behavioral\nand biological sciences are required to understand and solve\nthese problems. In order to maximize both the motivation of\ncrewmembers and the performance of the group as a whole,\nextra care should be taken with respect to their psychology.\n\nFor this purpose, a recreational facility might be impor-\ntant, and should be large enough to accommodate all\ncrewmembers at the same time. Games are an excellent\nrecreation, and promote interpersonal interactions in a meta-\nworld. Setting handicaps among crew members avoids fixed\nwinners and losers of games. Dining is a cultural and social\nevent. Celebration dinners can include an appropriate\namount of alcoholic beverage at certain intervals, depending\non the crewmembers cultural backgrounds. Decision making\nfor dining among crewmembers may help to maintain the\nleader and follower relationships. Keeping green plants and\nlive animals as pets in the spaceship or outpost will also have\npositive effects on crew psychology and interpersonal rela-\ntions. A core part of the psychological support for a space\n\ncrew is communication with ground personnel, including\nmedical and psychological counselors, as well as family and\nfriends.\n\n17.3.6 Innovative Approach for Human Space\nMission Challenges for the Final\nFrontier\n\nIf it is decided to extend human space exploration beyond\nthe Moon, an innovative approach will be required for life\nsupport management. For larger crew sizes and longer\nmission durations, the bioregenerative life support concept\nshould be given strong consideration for recycling bio-sub-\nstances. However, there are many issues to be solved before\nits implementation. The robustness of space agriculture must\nbe verified to ensure survivability of the space crew, and the\nrisks of system failures must be understood. Human factors\nand psychology, together with a broad range of other new\nitems, are essential fields of study prior to making crewed\nmissions to Mars and other distant extraterrestrial bodies the\nfinal frontier of human civilization.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

A typical relative velocity at the start of\nentry is between 4 km/s for Mars orbit and 47.4 km/s for\ndirect entry to the Jovian atmosphere from interplanetary\ncruise [1]. Aerodynamic decelerators such as parachutes or\nballutes only function correctly at much lower velocities.\nThe excess kinetic energy must therefore be dissipated by\nthe entry system.\n\nThe excess kinetic energy is generally converted to heat,\nby means of the aerothermodynamics of the entry vehicle.\n\nThis energy is then dissipated by a combination of radiation,\nconvection, and endothermic chemical reactions.\n\nThe configuration of the entry vehicle during the entry\nphase is generally unchanged from the cruise phase, other\nthan potentially the jettisoning of a cruise instrument unit.\nThe shape of the vehicle is designed to facilitate the con-\ntrolled dissipation of the kinetic energy by means of its\naerodynamic shape and mass properties. A recent exception\nto this case has been with the development of inflatable\naeroshells to increase the drag area of the vehicle and thus\nincrease the deceleration for given flow conditions.\n\nThe entry phase is generally unguided. The entry vehicle is\ntrimmed to fly in a non-lifting configuration. This is the sim-\nplest form of trajectory and is suitable for most planetary entries\nwith sufficiently dense atmospheres and robust payloads.\n\nLifting trajectories may be achieved by offsetting the\ncenter of gravity of the vehicle so that it flies at a constant,\nnon-zero angle of attack. This allows limited control of the\nflight path angle and cross-range velocity to be achieved by\nrotating the vehicle and thus the lift vector about its axis.\nLifting trajectories allow limited targeting and the moder-\nation of accelerations and heating by continuously targeting\nan appropriate altitude and thus density for the desired\nparameters.\n\nFinally, the vehicle can utilize a fully controlled entry\nsuch as that of the Space Shuttle orbiter or X-37 spaceplane.\nThis allows far better control of the entry than a simple\nlifting vehicle but also requires significant control input.\n\n18.1.3 Descent\n\nThe terminal velocity that may be achieved during the entry\nphase is limited by the area of the entry vehicle, which is in\nturn usually limited by the size of the fairing on the rocket\nused to launch it. This velocity is usually too large for any\npractical landing system. Thus, the velocity must be\nreduced still further during the descent phase.\n\nS. Lingard (&) ? J. Underwood\nVorticity Ltd., Chalgrove, UK\ne-mail: Steve.Lingard@vorticity-systems.com\n\nM. Macdonald and V. Badescu (eds.), The International Handbook\nof Space Technology, Springer Praxis Books, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_18,\n? Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014\n\n515\n\n\n\nThe prime purpose of the descent system is to reduce the\ndescent velocity to a value compatible with the landing\nsystem. Two general types of descent system are in com-\nmon use: aerodynamic decelerators and powered descent.\nThe first type usually consists of one or more aerodynamic\ndecelerators; usually parachutes. These also fulfill second-\nary roles such as stabilization of the vehicle during descent\nand removal of the protective aeroshell from the lander. The\nsecond uses a rocket system to reduce the vehicle velocity\nand usually guide it towards a safe landing site. Hybrid\nsystems are also possible in which a parachute performs the\ninitial deceleration and the descent sequence is completed\nusing powered descent.\n\nParachute descent systems can consist of anything from\none parachute upwards. Multiple parachute systems may be\nmulti-phase (where the parachutes are deployed sequen-\ntially), clustered (where several parachutes are deployed at\nthe same time), or both.\n\nMulti-phase systems are usually chosen where there are\nstaging requirements (e.g. removal of a two-part aeroshell)\nor where the use of multiple parachutes allows mass\nreduction of the system by optimization of the parachutes\nfor their operation conditions. In a single parachute system,\na parachute type that is compatible with supersonic\ndeployment and stable terminal descent must usually be\nchosen. It must be sized for the required terminal velocity\nbut stressed for the supersonic inflation force. Use of a\nmulti-parachute system allows a small, robust, supersonic-\noptimised parachute to decelerate the payload to a low\ndynamic pressure where a large, lightly stressed, stable\nparachute can complete the deceleration to landing.\n\nClustered parachutes may be chosen either to improve\nthe control of stresses or, more usually, to provide redun-\ndancy in case of failure of one canopy. They also allow the\nuse of otherwise unstable parachutes, since a cluster will\nalways descend vertically with respect to the air mass.\n\nAnother example of an aerodynamic decelerator system\nis a lifting body such as the Space Shuttle orbiter. In this\ncase, the descent system allows the vehicle to be flown as a\nglider to reach a conventional runway.\n\nPowered descent systems are chosen where soft touch-\ndown or terminal guidance is required, or where there is\ninsufficient atmosphere for an aerodynamic decelerator\nsystem. They require multi-nozzle or multi-engine, throt-\ntleable rocket systems, an inertial guidance platform, and a\nguidance system.\n\n18.1.4 Landing\n\nThe landing system completes the process of bringing the\nvehicle to rest on the surface of the planet by absorbing the\nremaining kinetic energy from the descent phase. This can\n\ntake many different forms. For a water landing, the landing\nenergy may be absorbed by displacement of the liquid in\nwhich it lands. For a landing on a solid surface, the energy\nmay be absorbed using crushable materials, landing legs, or\nairbag systems. In some cases, a proportion of the final\nenergy may be removed just before landing by a retro-\nrocket system. The choice of system depends largely on the\nmass of the vehicle, the mission requirements, and the ter-\nminal velocity.\n\nFor low terminal rates of descent, such as those resulting\nfrom a powered descent or an aircraft-type landing, either a\ncrushable material or landing legs may be used. These are\nmass-effective where very small strokes are required but\nthey are limited for larger rates of descent by the need for\nlonger strokes to limit accelerations to acceptable levels.\n\nAirbag systems are capable of accommodating larger\nterminal rates of descent. The size of the airbag system is\ndetermined by the terminal rate of descent, acceptable\nvehicle acceleration, and thermodynamic efficiency of the\nsystem. Airbag systems work by converting the kinetic\nenergy of the vehicle into internal energy of the gas within the\nairbags. Two types of airbag system have been used: vented\nand non-vented, the difference being in the way in which they\nmanage the energy absorbed during the landing event.\n\nA vented airbag system detects when the payload has, or\nis about to, come to rest. It then activates a valve that allows\nthe compressed gas within the airbag to vent to the atmo-\nsphere, thus releasing the energy. This results in the payload\ncoming to rest on the first impact and allows the airbag\nsystem to be designed to protect only the lower side of the\nvehicle. The terminal trajectory of the payload must be\nconsidered carefully in order to preclude the vehicle tipping\nover during the landing event.\n\nIn a non-vented airbag system, the pressure within the\nairbag is returned to kinetic energy and the vehicle bounces.\nThis will then result in a series of subsequent impacts. In\nthis case, the initial impact energy is gradually dissipated\nover a number of bounces by means of thermodynamic\nlosses in the compression and expansion of the airbag gas\nand by deformation of the surface on which it lands. Non-\nvented airbag systems are simple, requiring no control\nsystems; however, they must envelop the lander, since the\norientation of the second impact is random, and the airbags\nmust subsequently be released or retracted in order to\nenable the lander to perform its function.\n\n18.1.5 Examples\n\nThe range of potential entry, descent, and landing systems\n(EDLS) is best illustrated using mission examples.\n\nThe lunar Surveyor landers were typical of landing\nsystems for bodies without atmospheres. The entire\n\n516 S. Lingard and J. Underwood\n\n\n\ndeceleration from transfer orbit to landing was achieved\nusing a powered descent, decelerating from 2 km/s to a\nlanding velocity of only 3.5 m/s. The landing system con-\nsisted of three articulated legs that included energy\nabsorbing elements to remove the final descent velocity [2],\nas can be seen in Fig. 18.1.\n\nThe Mars Pathfinder lander was designed to be a simple,\nreliable entry, descent, and landing system. The entry phase\nwas accomplished using a non-lifting ablative aeroshell that\ndecelerated the lander to Mach 1.8, at which time a single\nparachute was deployed. This decelerated the vehicle to a\nvelocity of 63 m/s, at a height of 88 m above the surface,\nwhere upon a retro-rocket system decelerated it to rest at a\nheight of 21 m and a non-vented airbag system was\ndeployed [3], as shown in Fig. 18.2. The lander came to rest\nfollowing a series of bounces.\n\nThe Apollo command module used a lifting, ablating\naeroshell for the entry phase [4]. This allowed management\nof the heat load, deceleration, and landing point. The des-\ncent system comprised of eight parachutes: two drogues for\ninitial stabilization; and three pilot chutes, each of which\ndeployed one of the three main chutes [5]. The system was\nsized to survive single parachute failures. A water landing\nwas chosen so that no landing system was required other\nthan post-landing flotation devices.\n\nThe Space Shuttle orbiter was a lifting body with an\ninsulating coating. The entry was controlled to keep the\nheating rates within a range that could be dissipated during\nentry. The descent and landing was accomplished as a\nglider.\n\n18.2 System Design and Design Drivers\n\nWhen designing a planetary lander or Earth return vehicle,\nit is important that the entry, descent, and landing elements\nbe designed as an integrated system rather than as three\nseparate entities. It is also important that the EDL system\ndesign is considered during the initial mission design when\nconsidering approach trajectories, landing sites, and direct\nversus orbital entry.\n\nThe system design drivers may be split into two groups:\nthose that are outside the control of the mission designer\n(e.g. the atmosphere and gravity of the destination) and\nthose that may be influenced by the EDL designer (e.g. the\napproach velocity and system mass).\n\nThe atmosphere of the target body is a key driver in the\ndesign of an EDL system. If the body has no atmosphere,\nthen a powered descent or a hard landing are the only\noptions for the entry and descent. For a body with an\n\nFig. 18.1 Charles Conrad Jr.,\nApollo 12 Commander, examines\nthe robotic Surveyor III\nspacecraft during the second\nextravehicular activity (EVA-2).\nThe Lunar Module (LM)\n\u2018Intrepid\u2019 is in the right\nbackground. This picture was\ntaken by astronaut Alan L. Bean,\nLunar Module pilot. The Intrepid\nlanded on the Moon\u2019s Ocean of\nStorms less than 200 m from\nSurveyor III. The television\ncamera and several other\ncomponents were taken from\nSurveyor III and brought back to\nEarth for analysis. Surveyor III\nsoft-landed on the Moon on April\n19, 1967. Image NASA; AS12-\n48-7136 (20 Nov. 1969)\n\n18 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems 517\n\n\n\natmosphere, the nature of the atmosphere is important to the\nsystem design.\n\nThe atmosphere has a direct influence on the available\nentry conditions. A steep atmospheric entry allows accurate\ntargeting, albeit with high deceleration and heat flux. For a\ndense atmosphere such as that of Earth, the steepest entry is\nlimited by the allowable heat flux and deceleration. For a\ntenuous atmosphere such as Mars, the limit is determined by\nthe need to complete the entry and descent deceleration\nbefore reaching the ground. A shallow entry reduces both\nacceleration and heat flux, but risks skipping out of the\natmosphere if too shallow. For tenuous atmospheres such as\nMars, the useable entry corridor for an arrival from inter-\nplanetary cruise is only a few degrees wide.\n\nKnowledge of atmospheric properties and their vari-\nability is a second important influence. The entry and des-\ncent system must be compatible with the likely range of\natmosphere properties. Where the atmosphere properties are\nnot known or are known but are variable, margin must be\ntaken in system design to allow for this.\n\nThe gravity of the target body, along with the atmo-\nsphere, determines the potential solutions for terminal\ndescent. Where a parachute system is used, gravity will\ninfluence the size of parachute required for a given rate of\ndescent such that either a powered descent or a retro-\nassisted terminal descent may be appropriate.\n\nThe entry velocity is determined by the gravity of the\nbody and the arrival conditions (e.g. from orbit or inter-\nplanetary cruise). An entry from orbit will have a lower\nenergy than a direct entry; however, this is usually at the\nexpense of an inefficient chemical burn to place the\nspacecraft in orbit initially. In practice, direct entries are\nused for all planetary missions unless there is a compelling\n\nreason for a pre-entry orbital phase (for example, in the case\nof Viking when the martian landing sites were assessed\nbefore initiating the lander mission).\n\nThe ballistic coefficient, introduced in Chap. 5,\nb \u00bc m=CdS\u00f0 \u00de of an object is a measure of its terminal velocity\n\nor resistance to deceleration. A low ballistic coefficient is\nadvantageous for entries to planets with thin atmospheres\nsince the deceleration to landing velocity may be achieved\nmore rapidly. The minimum ballistic coefficient is generally\nlimited by the launch vehicle. That is, because heat shields are\nusually solid, their maximum diameter is limited to that of the\nlaunch fairing. This results in a maximum mass of entry\nvehicle that can be considered for a Mars entry without using\nnovel techniques such as inflatable aeroshells.\n\nThroughout the design process, the ability to qualify the\nEDL system must be considered. The best technical solution\nis not always the most practical to validate. The needs of\nvalidation must always be considered against those of\ntechnical elegance.\n\n18.3 Entry\n\nThe objective of the entry phase is to reduce the relative\nvelocity of the entry vehicle to an appropriate value for the\ntransition to the descent/landing system at a point where it\nhas sufficient altitude and time to operate. This is accom-\nplished by converting the kinetic energy of the vehicle into\nthermal energy by means of the aerothermodynamics of the\nvehicle and then either dissipating it (by ablation, convec-\ntion, or radiation) or absorbing it. The system charged with\npreventing the heat generated during entry from damaging\nthe entry vehicle is the thermal protection system (TPS).\n\nFig. 18.2 Engineers test the\nMars Pathfinder airbags in June\n1995\n\n518 S. Lingard and J. Underwood\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_5\n\n\n18.3.1 Concepts and Constraints\n\nFor any mission, there will be an acceptable entry corridor.\nThe flight path angle at the start of entry is limited at the\nshallow extreme by the risk of skipping out of the atmo-\nsphere and at the steep extreme by lack of altitude, exces-\nsive heat flux, or deceleration.\n\nFor a shallow entry angle, there is the possibility of\nskipping out of the atmosphere if the velocity is high\nenough, rather than entering as intended. During the initial\nphases of entry, the flight path angle will reduce (become\nshallower) as the surface of the planet falls away from the\nvehicle. The deceleration of the vehicle must be sufficient to\nallow it to follow the curvature of the planet. The risk of\nskipping is greatest for small bodies (with the smallest\nradius), tenuous atmospheres, and shallow entry angles.\n\nFor a given entry velocity, the kinetic energy to be dis-\nsipated during the entry is fixed. The designer does, how-\never, have control over both the magnitude and the length of\nthe heating event, and this allows the thermal protection\nsystem to be optimized.\n\nThe peak heat flux occurs part way through the entry.\nThe heat flux increases with increasing atmospheric density\nbut decreases with reducing velocity. For a given entry\nvehicle and arrival velocity, the peak heat flux will be\ngreatest for a steep entry where the vehicle penetrates the\ndenser atmosphere while retaining more of its initial\nvelocity. The peak heat flux determines the type of ablative\nmaterial that may be used in the heat shield.\n\nThe peak acceleration (i.e. deceleration) usually occurs\nclose to the peak heat flux. Again, the greatest acceleration is\ngenerally associated with the steepest entry. The maximum\nallowable acceleration may be limited by the design of\nthe entry vehicle or by the physiological limits of its\noccupants.\n\nThe total heat load into the thermal protection system\ndepends on the characteristics of the entry trajectory. While\nthe total energy dissipated during an entry is fixed for a\ngiven entry velocity, the proportion which is absorbed\nrather than radiated or convected away depends on the\ncharacteristics of the entry vehicle and its trajectory.\n\nThe heat soak must be considered during the design of a\nprotective heat shield. During entry, much of the kinetic\nenergy will be dissipated; however, the surface temperature\nof the thermal protection system will be elevated and heat\nwill be conducted to the vehicle behind it. The TPS must be\ndesigned to prevent the protected structure from reaching\nunacceptable temperatures. For planetary entry vehicles, it\nis conventional to design the TPS such that the heat pulse\ndoes not reach the rear face of the TPS until after the heat\nshield has been released. This leads to a requirement to\nreduce the entry trajectory so that there is less time for the\nheat to soak through the TPS. An alternative, employed on\n\nthe Space Shuttle orbiter is to absorb the heat and re-radiate\nit before it has time to soak through to the vehicle beneath.\n\nDuring entry, it is usually necessary for the vehicle to\nremain in a stable attitude in order for the TPS to work\noptimally. This requires either an active control system or,\nmore usually, a vehicle that is aerodynamically stable over\nthe deceleration from hypersonic to supersonic speeds. This\nplaces constraints on the shape of the entry vehicle and on\nthe location of the center of gravity.\n\n18.3.2 Entry Heating\n\nDuring entry, the kinetic energy of the vehicle is converted\nto heat energy. This principally occurs in the shock wave\nahead of the vehicle. For this reason, entry vehicles are\ndesigned with blunt noses to ensure that the shock wave\nstands off from the vehicle. The transmission of the energy\nto the vehicle is by both convection and radiation. As the\natmospheric gas passes through the shock wave, its tem-\nperature and density increase and its velocity decreases. As\nthis hot gas then flows around the entry vehicle it can\ntransfer energy to the TPS. This convective heat transfer\nmay be reduced by the use of ablative materials, where the\npyrolysis gases evolved from the TPS tend to keep the hot\natmosphere gases away from the surface of the material.\n\nThe stagnation point convective heat flux may be esti-\nmated from the Sutton and Graves [6] correlation qconv \u00bc\nk\nffiffiffiffiffi\nq\n\nrnose\n\np\nV31 where q is freestream density, rnose is the nose\n\nradius, and V? is the flight velocity. The coefficient k (kg\n0.5/\n\nm) has values as follows: Mars 1.898 9 10-4, Venus\n1.986 9 10-4, Titan 1.741 9 10-4, and Earth 1.762 9 10-4.\n\nAt high speeds (several kilometers per second), the\nstrength of the shock wave is such that molecular dissoci-\nation takes place. This causes emission of radiation at\nwavelengths that are characteristic of the atmospheric gases.\nA proportion of this radiation then reaches the surface of the\nTPS. The radiative heating of the TPS is thus dependent on\nthe velocity of the entry vehicle and the atmosphere into\nwhich it is penetrating. Radiative heat transfer may be\ncomputed using the Tauber-Sutton radiative heating corre-\nlation for Earth and Mars [7].\n\nThe objective of the TPS material is to dissipate as much\nof this energy as possible and to absorb the remainder.\n\n18.3.3 Thermal Protection System Materials\n\nAll thermal protection systems use materials that are\ndesigned to minimize the conduction of heat to the entry\nvehicle. Combine materials combine a low thermal con-\nductivity, high specific heat capacity, and endothermic\nreactions (pyrolysis) in differing proportions.\n\n18 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems 519\n\n\n\nSome materials such as the silica tiles used on the Space\nShuttle orbiter rely entirely on low conductivity and high heat\ncapacity. Since they do not degrade during entry, they may be\nused many times. Other materials act as insulators until a\nspecific heat flux is reached, at which point they start to ablate\nin order to dissipate additional energy. Controlled ablation is\na good mechanism for dissipating energy; however, if the\nablation is too fast, the heat shield becomes less effective.\n\nA good ablator material will undergo pyrolysis, thereby\nabsorbing energy and releasing gases that transport the\nenergy away from the TPS. Material that has already\nreacted should remain as a surface char layer in order to act\nas an additional insulator between the incident heat flux and\nthe pyrolyzing layer. This char layer can be destroyed if the\nrate of pyrolysis is excessive or the aerodynamic shear on\nthe surface is too great.\n\nAblators are generally categorized by their density.\nHigh-density ablators are capable of withstanding high heat\nfluxes and producing strong char layers capable of resisting\naerodynamic shear forces; lower density ablators cannot\nsurvive the most extreme conditions but provide a much\nlighter design in the conditions for which they are usable.\n\nFor the highest heat flux entries, high-density ablators\nsuch as carbon-phenolic are required, as in the case of the\nNASA Galileo probe [1], which had an entry heat flux of\napproximately 30 kW/cm2, and the NASA Pioneer Venus\nprobes. The material used for these probes is no longer in\nproduction and no other material with similar properties is\ncurrently available. For lower heat flux entries such as Earth\nsample return missions (Stardust, Genesis), a medium\ndensity ablator such as PICA (phenolic-impregnated carbon\nablator) may be considered. For the lowest heat fluxes such\nas Mars entries and entries from orbit, low-density ablators\nsuch as SLA561 or Norcoat Liege are more common.\n\nHigher density ablators may often be substituted for lower\ndensity alternatives. The design will be less mass efficient but\nsince the ablation will be lower, they may potentially be\nreusable. For instance, a modified version of PICA is used on\nthe SpaceX Dragon capsule for return from Earth orbit. Since\nthe heat flux in this case is below the pyrolysis threshold for\nthis material, the heat shield is able to be reused.\n\nWhen designing an entry system, the availability of TPS\nmaterials must be considered [8], recognizing that many of the\nmaterials used on past missions are no longer manufactured.\n\n18.3.4 Entry Vehicle Geometry\n\nEntry vehicles can be grouped into two general classes:\nlifting bodies and blunt bodies. Lifting bodies such as the\nSpace Shuttle orbiter, Buran (Russian: <yp\u00e1y), and the X-37\nuse thrusters for attitude control during the early stages of\nentry and subsequently aerodynamic control. Blunt bodies\n\nsuch as planetary landers and crewed orbital capsules rely on\neither thrusters or gyroscopic attitude control during the early\nstages of entry and aerodynamic stability subsequently.\n\nThe need for stability results in stringent requirements on\nthe position of the center of gravity for non-lifting vehicles.\nThe requirements differ with the geometry of the vehicle.\nSeveral geometries have been used.\n\nThe 70? sphere-cone has been adopted for European and\nUS Mars entry vehicles. It offers the highest drag coefficient\nof the sphere-cone vehicles (1.6 at Mach 4) but the least\nstatic stability. In order for the vehicle to be stable through\nentry, the center of gravity must be further forward, relative\nto the overall diameter, than any other sphere-cone.\n\nThe 60? sphere-cone was used on the ESA Huygens\nprobe for Titan and the NASA Stardust sample return\nmission. It has a slightly lower drag coefficient than the 70?\nsphere-cone (1.5 at Mach 4) but increased stability.\n\nThe 45? sphere-cone has a drag coefficient of only 1.1 at\nMach 4; however, it is more stable than the previous shapes.\nThis shape was used for the NASA Galileo and Deep Space\n2 missions. On the latter, the aeroshell was designed to align\nitself during entry from any orientation.\n\nThe Apollo command modules and ESA\u2019s Atmospheric\nReentry Demonstrator (ARD) mission used a blunted cone\nshape which was trimmed to fly at constant angle of attack.\nEach of these shapes are shown in Fig. 18.3.\n\n18.3.5 Aerodynamics\n\nThe aerodynamics of the entry vehicle must be understood\nin order to predict the trajectory and to ensure its stability.\nIn typical terrestrial applications, the static and dynamic\naerodynamic coefficients are functions of the Reynolds\n\nnumber, introduced in Chap. 5, (Re \u00bc q:U1:Ll , where q is the\ndensity of the flow, U? is the freestream velocity, and l is\nthe dynamic viscosity) and the Mach number only. As the\nspeed increases to hypersonic, however, the energy of the\nflow is sufficient to cause molecular dissociation. At this\nstage, the aerodynamic coefficients are now influenced by\nthe chemical composition of the atmosphere. Thus, an entry\nvehicle may have different aerodynamic characteristics on\nEarth and Mars, even at the same Mach number.\n\nAs the atmosphere becomes thinner, the flow then tran-\nsitions from continuum to free-molecular flow as the dis-\ntance between the individual atmosphere molecules\nincreases. At this stage, the flow then varies with the\nKnudsen number, introduced in Chaps. 4, 5, (Kn \u00bc kL, where\nk is the mean free-path between molecules and L is the\ncharacteristic length of the vehicle).\n\nThe variability of the aerodynamic properties results in\nthe need for a comprehensive aerodynamic database (or\ndatabases) covering the chosen vehicle geometry across all\n\n520 S. Lingard and J. Underwood\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_5\n\n\nflow regimes in the chosen atmosphere. Such databases,\ngenerated by a combination of computational fluid\ndynamics (CFD) and testing, require significant investment\nto produce. Thus, only a few shapes have been used for the\nmissions that have flown and aerodynamic databases have\nbeen reused.\n\n18.3.6 Inflatable Decelerators\n\nConventional entry systems use rigid heat shields that must\nbe small enough to fit within the fairing of the launch\nvehicle. This places a lower limit on the achievable ballistic\ncoefficient and hence on the entry heat flux for a given\nmission. If the ballistic coefficient could be reduced, this\nwould allow the entry heat flux to be reduced because\ngreater acceleration could take place at high altitude in the\nlower density atmosphere.\n\nOne method of achieving this reduction in ballistic\ncoefficient is to use an inflatable aeroshell. This generally\ntakes the form of a tension cone with its shape maintained\nby a pressurized torus around its periphery. This technology\nhas been investigated in Europe in the Inflatable Reentry\nand Descent Technology (IRDT) [9] tests and in the USA\nwith the NASA Hypercone [10]. Although partially suc-\ncessful demonstrator missions have been flown, no mission\nhas yet made use of this technology.\n\n18.3.7 Trajectories\n\nThree general types of trajectory can be flown: ballistic,\nlifting, and controlled.\n\nThe ballistic trajectory is the simplest and most common.\nThe entry vehicle is usually axisymmetric and trimmed to\nfly at zero angle of attack. During the coasting phase from\ncarrier separation to entry, the entry vehicle is spin-stabi-\nlized. The vehicle spin axis is orientated prior to entry such\nthat it will be aligned with the air-relative velocity vector at\nthe time that sufficient aerodynamic force is generated to\nfacilitate control of the vehicle attitude during entry. The\nspin continues throughout the entry, in order to cancel out\nthe effects of any asymmetry in the outer geometry of the\nvehicle on the aerodynamics and any error in center of\n\ngravity position on the motion. This entry technique needs\nno guidance system, and is not controllable. The descent\nsystem is generally triggered by an accelerometer that\nestimates the instantaneous velocity from its decelerating\neffect on the vehicle.\n\nA ballistic trajectory is suitable for planetary entry\nmissions where simplicity and robustness are more impor-\ntant than accurate targeting.\n\nThe lifting trajectory is a variation of the ballistic tra-\njectory. The entry vehicle is usually an axisymmetric shape\nwith an offset center of gravity (such as Apollo or ARD).\nSince the vehicle will naturally fly at a constant angle of\nattack, it will generate lift as well as drag. For this type of\ntrajectory, the lift to drag ratio is constant; the trajectory is\nalways lifting and so if no lift is required, frequent roll\nreversal maneuvers are necessary.\n\nIn order to make use of this lift, the entry vehicle must\nincorporate a control system and a means of reorientating\nthe lift vector. The control system generally uses acceler-\nometers to measure the deceleration of the vehicle and an\ninertial platform to determine its orientation. The lift vector\ncan be reoriented by using thrusters to rotate the vehicle\nabout its axis.\n\nA lifting vehicle allows a control system to tailor the\ntrajectory in several ways. The lift vector can be rotated\nupwards or downwards. This allows the trajectory to move\nbetween more or less dense regions of atmosphere in order\nto maintain either a constant density or a constant acceler-\nation. For a crewed mission, the deceleration can be limited\nto a human tolerance level by ascending into the more\nrarefied atmosphere if the deceleration becomes too large.\nAlternatively, a shallow trajectory may be chosen in order\nto limit the heat flux but the lift vector may be used to\npreclude skipping out of the atmosphere.\n\nMore complex guidance algorithms such as that used by\nApollo allow the roll position to be used to control the\nparachute deployment position. Cross-track adjustments\nmay be made by biasing the roll position to one side or the\nother, and downrange adjustments may be made by\nascending into the more rarefied atmosphere to increase the\ndownrange distance or by descending into the denser\natmosphere to reduce it.\n\nAs with ballistic entry vehicles, the lifting vehicle is\nlikely to be spin stabilized during the coast phase. Just\n\nFig. 18.3 70?, 60? and 45? sphere-cones and Apollo blunted cone\n\n18 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems 521\n\n\n\nbefore entry, the spin must be neutralized using a de-spin\nsystem. The guidance system then controls the roll position\nof the spacecraft in order to follow the desired trajectory.\n\nControlled trajectories such as that of the Space Shuttle\nallow the lift vector to be rotated, as with the lifting tra-\njectory, and also its magnitude to be varied. This allows\ngreater control over the entry trajectory at the cost of a more\ncomplicated control system. In this case, the vehicle attitude\nmust be controlled using thrusters during the initial phase of\nentry until sufficient aerodynamic force has built up to allow\nthe control surfaces to perform their functions.\n\n18.3.8 Transition to Descent\n\nThe vehicle shapes used for ballistic or lifting entries are\ndynamically unstable at transonic velocities. Consequently\nthey could not be used for an uncontrolled descent to the\nsurface, even if the velocity was acceptable. The entry\nphase thus usually ends at a Mach number that is no less\nthan about 1.4.\n\nSince it is impossible to measure Mach number directly,\nit must be inferred using alternative means. The most\ncommon method of determining the correct time to start the\ndescent sequence is by using an accelerometer to detect the\ndeceleration of the vehicle. If the atmospheric structure and\ndrag of the entry vehicle are well known, the trajectory may\nbe predicted and the Mach number correlated with accel-\neration. An alternative approach is to use an inertial plat-\nform to monitor the deceleration through descent; however,\nthe initial setting of the platform must be very accurate and\nthe winds at the deployment location must be low in order\nto avoid errors.\n\n18.4 Descent\n\nThe descent system controls the spacecraft from the end of\nentry through to contact with the surface. The purpose of the\ndescent system is to reduce the velocity relative to the pla-\nnet\u2019s surface to a value compatible with the landing system,\nto stabilize the vehicle, and possibly also to guide the vehicle\nto its landing point. Generally, the descent system comprises\nparachutes and/or a propulsive system. Gliding vehicles\n(Space Shuttle orbiter), auto-rotating helicopters, and bal-\nloons may also be considered as descent systems.\n\n18.4.1 Heritage Descent Systems\n\nDescent systems that have been used on robotic Western\nspace missions are summarized in Table 18.1 using data\nfrom \u2018\u2018Aerodynamic Decelerators for Planetary\n\nExploration: Past, Present and Future\u2019\u2019 [11] supple-\nmented with some limited data on Russian missions.\nSimilar data for crewed missions is shown in Table 18.2\n[12, 13].\n\nAll successful Mars landers have used a single parachute\nfollowed by either a retro-rocket or a propulsive descent\nsystem. Such a system is selected because it would require a\nvery large and grossly mass-inefficient parachute system to\nland a probe without propulsion. Added to this, there would\nbe severe risk of the parachute enveloping the lander. A\ntwo-stage parachute system can provide a lower mass\nsolution but, although studied for both ExoMars 2016 and\nMars Science Laboratory (MSL), this sequence has been\ndeemed too complex.\n\nBoth Pioneer Venus and Galileo [14] used staged sys-\ntems in order to aid separation of the aeroshell from the\nprobe. Huygens selected a similar approach, but added a\nthird parachute to the sequence to allow the lander to reach\nthe surface of Titan in the required time.\n\nAll Earth return systems also use staged parachute\nsequences, with a drogue parachute deployed to stabilize the\nvehicle and reduce the dynamic pressure prior to deploy-\nment of the terminal descent parachute.\n\nWestern crewed systems have all employed water land-\nings and so no propulsive system is used to reduce the\nimpact velocity. The Russian Soyuz descent system, which\nreturns to land, uses a retro-rocket to reduce the impact\nvelocity.\n\n18.4.2 Parachutes\n\nParachutes play a key role in the entry, descent, and\nlanding of space vehicles. Parachutes provide decelera-\ntion, often from supersonic to subsonic speed. They can\nalso achieve a specific descent rate to enable scientific\nmeasurements to be obtained, provide stability (drogue\nfunction) to prevent the aeroshell from tumbling, to\nmeet instrumentation requirements, to deploy another\nparachute (pilot function), to achieve the ballistic coef-\nficients required to enable separation events, and to\npursue a trajectory suitable for completion of the EDL\nsequence.\n\nThere are many types of parachute but they fall into\ntwo functional groups: ballistic parachutes designed to\nprovide drag and stabilization, and steerable gliding para-\nchutes designed to provide some degree of control over the\nlanding site during descent. To date all extra-terrestrial\nprobes and crewed missions have used ballistic parachutes\n(Fig. 18.4). Gliding parachutes have been used for one\nEarth return mission: Genesis [15]. A gliding parachute\nwas also developed for the planned X-38 crewed system\n[16] (Fig. 18.5).\n\n522 S. Lingard and J. Underwood\n\n\n\n18.4.2.1 Basic Parachute Physics\nThe most significant parameter in the design of a ballistic\nparachute is its drag coefficient, i.e. the component of\naerodynamic force resolved in the direction of the air flow.\nThe deceleration of the parachute and payload is achieved\nby transferring its momentum to the air through which it\npasses. The drag, D, is related to the drag coefficient, CD0 ,\nthe canopy area, So, and the dynamic pressure,\nq \u00bc qV2=2\u00f0 \u00de, by Eq. 4.105, which can also be written as\n\nD \u00bc 1\n2\n\nqV2CD0 So \u00f018:1\u00de\n\nThe product CD0 S0 is referred to as the drag area, and is\nused to define parachute performance requirements for a\ngiven application. The canopy area, S0, is the entire surface\narea of the canopy including any openings or vents. Typi-\ncally, CD0 has a value between 0.4 and 0.8 and is influenced\nby several parameters: porosity, canopy shape, suspension\nline length, payload wake effects, the Reynolds number per\nunit length and the Mach number. Of these, porosity is the\nmost important.\n\nTwo forms of porosity are introduced into a parachute\ncanopy. Geometric porosity is produced by physical gaps in\nthe canopy and permeability from the air flow passing\n\nTable 18.1 Descent and landing systems for robotic extra-terrestrial and Earth return missions; numbers in parenthesis indicate stages\n\nMission Parachute type Diameter or\narea\n\nDeployment\nMach\n\nDeployment\nsystem\n\nTerminal descent Landing\nsystem\n\nViking Disk-gap-band 16.2 m D0 2.1 Mortar Propulsive Landing legs\n\nPioneer Venus (1) Ribless guide\nsurface\n\n(1) 0.76 (1) 0.8 (1) Mortar None None\n\n(2) Conical ribbon (2) 4.94 m D0 (2) 0.8 (2) Pilot\nparachute\n\nGalileo (1) Conical ribbon (1) 1.14 m D0 (1) 0.95 (1) Mortar None None\n\n(2) Conical ribbon (2) 3.8 m D0 (2) 0.95 (2) Pilot\nparachute\n\nMars 2, 3, 6, 7 (1) Cross (1) 4 m D0 (1) 3.5 (1) Mortar Retro-rocket None\n\n(2) Reefed cross (2) 13.4 m D0 (2) 3.4 (2) Pilot\nparachute\n\nMars Pathfinder Disk-gap-band 12.7 m D0 1.71 Mortar Retro-rocket Non-vented\nairbags\n\nMars Polar Lander Disk-gap-band 12.7 m D0 1.7\u20131.85 Mortar Propulsive Landing legs\n\nBeagle 2 (1) Disk-gap-band (1) 3.2 m D0 (1) 1.5 (1) Mortar None Non-vented\nairbags(2) Ringsail (2) 10.0 m D0 (2) 0.4\u20130.6 (2) Pilot\n\nParachute\n\nMars Exploration\nRovers\n\nDisk-gap-band 14.1 m D0 1.8 and 1.9 Mortar Retro-\nrocket ?

Geometric porosity is the ratio of\nthe open areas of the canopy to the total area of the canopy.\nThe performance of a parachute is affected by the total\nporosity of the canopy, both geometric and fabric.\nIncreasing the porosity reduces the drag coefficient, reduces\nthe trim angle, increases the static stability, increases the\n\nparachute inflation time, and reduces the parachute inflation\nloads. The effect of porosity on the drag coefficient (adapted\nfrom [17]) is shown in Fig. 18.6, while Fig. 18.7 shows its\neffect on the trim angle.\n\nA parachute with a trim angle of 0? angle of attack will\nalways descend vertically, however a parachute with a trim\nangle other than zero will descend in one of three modes:\noscillation, coning, or gliding. The mode depends on a\nparameter called the mass ratio, which is the ratio of the\nmass of fluid associated or added mass with the canopy or to\nthe payload mass. This may be written\n2:136 q\u00f0pD3P=12\u00de=mS\n? ffi\n\n, where mS is the payload mass and\nDP is the canopy projected diameter. With a high mass ratio\nthe payload mass is small compared to the mass of fluid\nassociated with the canopy, and the center of gravity of the\nsystem is near the canopy. In these circumstances, the\nsystem glides at the trim angle to the vertical. When the\nmass ratio is low, the system center of gravity is close to the\npayload and the system either oscillates or cones. This effect\ncan be very important in the case of planets with low-\ndensity atmospheres. A 10 m diameter parachute may have\na mass of only a few kilograms; however, the added mass\nwill be as much as 200 kg on Earth. Thus, the parachute\nmotion is dominated by the added mass rather than the\nphysical mass of the parachute. On Mars, the situation is\ndifferent with the added mass for the same parachute being\nonly about 1.5 kg, which is less than the mass of the\nparachute itself. A parachute that glides on Earth is likely to\nbe unstable in a low-density atmosphere. This was dem-\nonstrated clearly during the testing of a low porosity ringsail\nparachute in the early development tests for Mars Science\nLaboratory (MSL) [18].

The extension is either a cylinder or an\ninverted frustum whose angle matches that of the suspen-\nsion lines and it acts to enhance stability at the expense of\nthe drag coefficient because the extension does not add to\nthe drag-producing surface. This feature was employed by\nMars Pathfinder [19] and Mars Exploration Rover [20] to\nprovide the high stability necessary for the retro-rockets.\n\nThe Reynold\u2019s number per unit length affects the per-\nmeability of porous broadloom material. At low values\n(\\5 9 104) the permeability is very low. At higher values\n([5 9 106) the permeability tends to its maximum value for\nthe specific material. For low density atmospheres, like\nMars, (Re/m) tends to low values whereas at low altitude on\nEarth it is quite high. Parachutes constructed from porous\nbroadloom could therefore change performance [21]. Based\non this, it is recommended to use zero porosity broadloom\nin order to maintain consistent behavior.\n\nLine length also has an effect on the parachute drag\ncoefficient. Typically, parachute line length is 0.8\u20131.0 D0.\nShorter lines can reduce the drag coefficient. Longer lines\nincrease the drag coefficient for parachutes whose shape is\nlargely determined by the pressure distribution (flat circu-\nlar) but they have only a small influence on parachutes with\na shape largely determined by the design, such as poly-\nconical designs.\n\nAs the parachute always flies in the wake of its payload,\nthis creates an inextricable link between the two, and\nparachute drag is diminished by the reduced fluid momen-\ntum in the wake. For large parachutes and small payloads,\nthe reduction in drag of the parachute due to this mechanism\nis approximately equal to the drag of the payload. More-\nover, the unsteady wake of the payload can cause the\nparachute to move in sympathy to the changing flow,\nstimulating oscillations.\n\nThe Mach number also has a significant effect on the\ndrag coefficient. Parachutes that perform well in the\n\nsubsonic range, such as conical ribbon parachutes, suffer\na rapid reduction in drag performance at quite low\nsupersonic speeds. The subsonic drag coefficient is\napproximately constant below Mach 0.4, subsequently\nrising steadily to Mach 0.75 in the normal way for a bluff\nbody in a compressible flow. Between Mach 0.75 and\nMach 1.0 the drag coefficient may reduce. From Mach 1.0\nto Mach 1.4 the drag coefficient remains reasonably\nconstant before falling steadily above Mach 1.5. Two\nmechanisms may cause cyclical inflation and collapse of\nthe parachutes in a supersonic flow. One derives from\nflying the parachute too close to the base of the vehicle.\nThis can couple the subsonic region of the wake with the\nsubsonic region in the parachute canopy, with conse-\nquential pressure bleed. Consequently, supersonic para-\nchutes should be designed to fly well downstream of the\npayload. A trailing distance LT [ 6DB ? D0 where DB is\nthe payload diameter has been proposed [22]. Another\nmechanism occurs even for a parachute that is deployed\nfar enough behind the probe to avoid pressure coupling. It\nresults from the disturbances in the payload wake that\ncause parachute bow shock movements, pressure fluctu-\nations in the parachute, and gross shape changes. The\npayload wake stimulates the bow shock to move cycli-\ncally close to the parachute mouth (high pressure and full\ninflation) and well upstream of the parachute mouth (low\npressure and partial collapse). The onset of this phe-\nnomenon is between Mach 2 and Mach 2.4. This behavior\nhas resulted in an upper limit of Mach 2.3 being set for\nthe deployment of the disk-gap-band parachute used for\nall Western missions to Mars.\n\nRather than using a single parachute, several identical\nparachutes can be deployed in a cluster, as shown in\nFigs. 18.9 and 18.10. Each parachute will contribute to the\noverall drag of the system. Clustering allows the use of\nseveral smaller parachutes that may be easier to deploy,\nrather than one large one. This also provides some degree of\nredundancy in the case of one canopy failing\u2014this was the\nprinciple for Apollo [13], and is shown in Fig. 18.10. The\ndisadvantages include system complexity and the greater\ninflation loads associated with faster opening.\n\nFig. 18.8 Extended skirt on the\nMars Exploration Rover (MER)\nparachute in wind tunnel at\nNASA Ames Research Center\n\n526 S. Lingard and J. Underwood\n\n\n\nWhen flying in a cluster, the parachutes do not touch\neach other but naturally leave a gap between them\n(Fig. 18.9). Parachutes flying in a cluster usually provide\nlower drag than they would individually. However, para-\nchutes with large trim angles fly stably in a cluster and\nhence it is possible to take advantage of their high drag\ncoefficients.\n\nThe highest load applied to a parachute occurs when it\ninflates, and this defines the strength needed for the\nparachute materials. The inflation process can be broken\ndown into a number of steps. Inflation begins when the\nparachute mouth opens to accept a single \u2018breath\u2019 of air.\nThis breath will then pressurize the top of the crown of the\nparachute. This pressurization will cause the mouth of the\nparachute to open, thereby allowing more air to flow into\nthe parachute. This air will cause the inflated portion of the\nparachute to increase from the crown towards the hem,\nuntil the canopy is fully inflated. The residual radial\nmomentum in the inflating parachute may cause over-\ninflation to occur before the parachute settles into the\nsteady-state inflated condition. For a parachute that inflates\nat close to constant velocity, for example in a wind tunnel\ntest or when the mass ratio is small, the maximum load\noccurs close to the end of inflation, when the parachute\ndiameter is increasing less rapidly and the rate of change\nof momentum of the gas around the parachute is greatest.\nIn this case, the ratio of the peak drag-coefficient during\nthe inflation to the steady state drag coefficient is called\nthe inflation factor. This factor typically is 1.1\u20132.0\ndepending on the parachute design and its porosity. When\nthe parachute mass ratio is large and the parachute\ndecelerates rapidly during inflation, the maximum load\nwill occur earlier in the inflation.\n\nPrediction of parachute inflation is a particularly com-\nplex problem. The inflation process is influenced by many\nfactors including flow velocity, atmosphere density, Mach\nnumber, payload wake, material, payload and canopy\nmasses, and the manner in which the parachute is packed.\nReferences [23\u201327] present various approaches.\n\nReefing is a technique used to modulate the drag of a\nparachute during opening and initial deceleration in order to\ncontrol both the force imposed on the payload and the\nstresses within the parachute. The most common technique\nis to sew a small metal ring onto each parachute line where\nit crosses the canopy mouth, and then pass a reefing line\nthrough all the rings. The line will have a shorter length\nthan the fully open circumference of the parachute and will\nthus constrict the parachute. Pyrotechnic cutters are pro-\nvided to release the line after sufficient time has passed to\nallow the payload to decelerate and the parachute force to\nreduce.\n\n18.4.2.2 Disk-Gap-Band\nVarious configurations of the disk-gap-band (DGB) para-\nchute have been used as the supersonic or single parachute\non all US Mars landers and the European Huygens and\nBeagle-2 probes. This parachute was selected by NASA for\nthe Viking probe owing to its inflation and flight charac-\nteristics at high Mach number in low density atmospheres\n[28]. It was also used as both the supersonic and the sub-\nsonic parachute on the ESA Huygens mission [29]\n(Fig. 18.11).\n\nStructurally, the parachute consists of a flat circular disk,\na cylindrical gap, and a cylindrical band.\n\nSeveral designs of DGB have been used, and each has\ndifferent characteristics. The Viking mission used a\n\nFig. 18.9 An Ares I main\ncluster parachute test at the U.S.\nArmy Proving Grounds in Yuma,\nArizona; May 20, 2009.

For the Mars\nPathfinder (MPF) mission, much greater stability was\nrequired than the 15-degree trim angle of the Viking design\nin order to ensure optimum performance of the retro-rock-\nets. Its stability was improved by increasing the length of\nthe band portion by a factor of 1.9 over that of the Viking\ndesign [19]. The ESA Huygens mission also required very\nhigh stability for the on-board camera. The solution adopted\nwas to increase the width of the gap by a factor of 2,\nincreasing the geometric porosity to 22.4 %, and providing\na design with a trim angle close to zero degrees [29].\nStardust, Mars Polar Lander, Genesis, Phoenix, and MSL all\nused the Viking geometry. The Mars Exploration Rover\n(MER) program used a very similar parachute to that of\nMPF, with a band length 1.8 times the Viking value [20].\n\nThe low subsonic drag coefficients for these disk-gap-\nband parachutes were typically 0.41 for MPF, 0.43 for\nMER, 0.49 for Huygens, and 0.6 for Viking (Fig. 18.12).\n\n18.4.2.3 Conical Ribbon\nConical ribbon parachutes are manufactured to have a\nshallow cone shape with the gores constructed from spaced\nribbons or tapes, usually 50 mm in width. These geometric\nporosity is typically 15\u201330 % with a drag coefficient of\n0.6\u20130.4. They are used extensively on Earth for high\ndynamic pressures in the transonic and subsonic regimes\nbecause their construction method allows very high\nstrength. Ribbon parachutes were used on the Galileo and\nPioneer Venus missions where opening at high dynamic\npressure (6 kPa) was required. Figure 18.4 shows the wind\ntunnel model of the Galileo ribbon parachute.\n\n18.4.2.4 Ringslot\nA ringslot parachute is a conical canopy constructed from\nbands of broadloom fabric with gaps, and is rather like a\n\nFig. 18.10 The capsule of\nApollo 15 descending safely\ndespite a parachute line failure.\nImage NASA; AP15-S71-42217\n(7 August 1971)\n\nFig. 18.11 The Huygens disk-gap-band parachute under test in the\n16-foot transonic wind tunnel at the US Air Force\u2019s Arnold\nEngineering Development Center in 1993.

The chutes\nwere opened at speeds ranging from 350\u20131,000 mph in the wind\ntunnel while information was gathered on their inflation characteris-\ntics. The Huygens test model was designed and fabricated by Micro\nCraft Inc. in Tullahoma, Tennessee, for the GE Aerospace Corp.,\nwhich was under contract to the European Space Agency.

It has a good heritage in the subsonic regime\nand was used in the Apollo system for pilot chutes. It was\nalso studies within the ESA ExoMars mission as a candidate\ndesign for subsonic terminal descent (Fig. 18.13).\n\n18.4.2.5 Ringsail\nThe ringsail parachute is essentially a ringslot design with\nincreased fullness in the lower edge of the bands away from\nthe vent region. It was used for the Apollo, Gemini, and\nMercury main parachutes. Ringsail parachutes were tested in\nthe NASA Planetary Entry Parachute Program (PEPP): a\nseries of high altitude, supersonic, full scale tests which were\na precursor to the Viking mission [28]. The parachutes tested\nhad a porosity of 16\u201317 %, and drag coefficients of 0.6 were\nmeasured with trim angle less than plus or minus 10?.\n\nThis parachute appears to have a very high drag coeffi-\ncient of up to 1.2 at low altitudes on Earth [18], owing to\nparachute glide. At higher altitudes on Earth, or at any\naltitude on Mars, the parachute is unstable and a much\nlower drag coefficient is observed. A low porosity ringsail\nparachute was baselined as the main parachute for MSL but\nwas later discarded following when it proved to be unstable\nin flight at high altitude.\n\n18.4.2.6 Cruciform\nCruciform or cross parachutes were tested as part of the\npreparation for the Viking mission [28] and proved to be\nunsuitable for supersonic operation. The drag coefficients\nfor these parachutes found in literature are higher than those\nfor axisymmetric parachutes; however, this is due to the use\nof the fabric area rather than the nominal area to calculate\nthe drag coefficient. In subsonic flow, they exhibit similar\ndrag performance, based on the cloth area, to disk-gap band\nparachutes but they have a rotational instability. The sta-\nbility of cross parachutes varies with the ratio of arm length\nto width (i.e. the aspect ratio). Both the drag coefficient and\nthe trim angle reduce with increasing aspect ratio.\n\nIn Russia, cruciform parachutes have been utilized where\nthe extremities of the cross shape are connected by a band\nof material. The addition of this material prevents the\nsupersonic scissoring motion exhibited by the standard\ncruciform parachute, but makes the parachute less drag\nefficient since additional canopy surface is required without\nany increase in drag.\n\nThis parachute has been used within the Russian space\nprogram; however, little information is available in the\nopen literature. A version of the modified cruciform was\nstudied in the early phases of ExoMars and was shown to\nhave a low drag coefficient similar to the Mars Pathfinder\nDGB of 0.41.\n\nFig. 18.12 The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover and\nits parachute viewed from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\u2019s High-\nResolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) as Curiosity\ndescended to the surface on Aug. 6 (UTC). Curiosity and its parachute\nare in the center of the white box; and a separate image is a smaller\ncutout of MSL stretched to avoid saturation. The rover is landing on\nthe etched plains just north of the sand dunes that fringe Mt. Sharp.\n\nThe parachute appears fully inflated and performing well. Details in\nthe parachute such as the band gap at the edges and the central hole are\nclearly visible. The cords connecting the parachute to the backshell\ncannot be seen, although they were seen in the image of Phoenix\ndescending, perhaps due to the difference in lighting angles. Image\nNASA/JPL/University of Arizona/HiRISE Team\n\n18 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems 529\n\n\n\n18.4.2.7 Polyconical\nPolyconical parachutes are constructed using broadloom\nfabric gores. The gores are patterned to give a constructed\ngeometry consisting of a number of concentric conical\nsections. They are usually constructed using very low\nporosity material.\n\nPolyconical parachutes appear to have drag coefficients\nof 1.2 or more at low level on Earth, based on their descent\nvelocity. In reality, from Fig. 18.7, the total velocity V is\ngreater than the descent velocity, with V \u00bc VV= sin 2a\u00f0 \u00de\nwhere VV is the descent velocity and a is the trim angle; the\ndrag coefficient is really about 0.8 and the trim angle is 30?\nto 40? to the vertical.\n\nPolyconical parachutes are frequently modified by the\naddition of drive slots, symmetrical openings in the gores\nlocated to the rear of the canopy, in order to provide\ndirectional glide. In practice, these slots do not cause the\nparachute to glide; they simply define the plane in which it\nglides naturally. Typical applications are the descent para-\nchute for the Stardust probe [30] and ejection seat\nparachutes.\n\n18.4.2.8 Parafoil\nThe parafoil [31], when inflated, resembles a low aspect\nratio wing with a typical aspect ratio of 3.0. It is entirely\nconstructed from fabric with no rigid members, which\nallows it to be packed and deployed in a manner similar to a\nconventional parachute canopy. The wing has upper and\nlower membrane surfaces, an airfoil cross section, and a\nrectangular planform. The airfoil section is formed by air-\nfoil shaped ribs sewn chord-wise between the upper and\nlower membrane surfaces at a number of span-wise\n\nintervals to form a series of cells. The leading edge of the\nwing is open over its entire length so that ram air pressure\nwill maintain the wing shape. The fabric used in the man-\nufacture of ram-air parachutes is as imporous as possible in\norder to obviate pressure loss. The suspension lines are\ngenerally attached to alternate ribs at multiple chord-wise\npositions. Although this results in a large number of sus-\npension lines, it is necessary in order to maintain the chord-\nwise profile. Parafoils can glide with a lift to drag ratio (L/\nD) in excess of 3:1. They are maneuverable and can land\nwith pin-point accuracy using on-board guidance and con-\ntrol systems. Parafoils have proved effective from small\n2 m2 wing area devices suitable for munitions right up to\nthe 697 m2 X-38 parafoil [16] shown in Fig. 18.14.\n\nParafoils were studied for pinpoint landings on Mars but\nthe results suggested that their response to control inputs\nwould be too violent because of the low added mass on\nMars; however, for denser atmospheres they have great\npotential.\n\n18.4.2.9 Deployment\nThe first parachute in a descent sequence must be positively\ndeployed in order to pass through the payload wake. Vari-\nous methods of deployment are possible, including pyro-\ntechnic mortars and tractor rockets.\n\nPyrotechnic mortars [32] are the usual way of deploying\npilot chutes for space missions. The parachute is packed in a\ntube, open at one end, above a moving piston. A pyro-\ntechnic charge pressurizes the closed volume under the\npiston and forces the piston out of the tube, pushing the\nparachute ahead of it. This is a very efficient method of\ndeploying a parachute; however, since the acceleration\ntakes place over a very short distance and thus time, the\nreaction loads are large for all but small parachutes. For\nexample, a 15 kg parachute ejected at 30 m/s would have a\nreaction load of about 40 kN.\n\nTractor rockets are used to deploy larger parachutes.\nThey are used on some ejection seats and capsules, and on\nwhole-aircraft recovery systems. A tractor rocket pulls the\nparachute out of a container and positively accelerates it\nthrough deployment. Since the force acts on the parachute\nfor much longer, the force and acceleration can be much\nlower. Furthermore, there is no reaction load on the pay-\nload. Tractor rockets are not currently used on space mis-\nsions due to their increased integration complexity.\n\nSecond and subsequent parachutes are generally\ndeployed by the released parachute as it separates from the\npayload. This can present challenges with large parachutes\nat high velocities, since the released parachute can accel-\nerate the deploying parachute to a high enough velocity\nduring deployment to risk significant deployment snatch\nloads and friction damage.\n\nFig. 18.13 Video screen-grab of ExoMars ringslot parachute during\nwind tunnel testing\n\n530 S. Lingard and J. Underwood\n\n\n\n18.4.3 Propulsive Descent\n\n18.4.3.1 Descent Propulsion Systems\nA descent propulsion system was first used on a crewed\nvehicle for the Apollo Lunar Module, however it had pre-\nviously been used on robotic missions including the Sur-\nveyor lunar landers; the first vehicles to unintentionally\n(Surveyor-3) and intentionally (Surveyor-6) liftoff from the\nlunar surface. The Apollo Lunar Module propulsion system\ntransferred the vehicle, containing two crew, from the cir-\ncular 110 km lunar parking orbit to a 15 km perilune des-\ncent orbit. Subsequently a powered descent to the lunar\nsurface, including sufficient hover time at low altitude to\nselect the exact landing site, was provided. The hypergolic\nbipropellant propulsion system, which used Aerozine 50\nand nitrogen tetroxide, and was throttleable from 10 to\n60 % thrust with a maximum 100 % thrust of 45 kN. The\nApollo Lunar Module\u2019s descent propulsion system (DPS)\nengine was able to be gimbaled to precisely align the thrust\nvector through the center of gravity at start-up, after which\nit was held in position and the vehicle changed orientation\nto steer.\n\nThe Viking missions in 1976 were influenced by the\ndesign of Apollo. The Viking descent propulsion system\n[33] brought the lander to within 2.4(\u00b11) m/s vertical\nvelocity and \\1 m/s horizontal velocity at touchdown.\nTrajectory and attitude control was achieved through the\nuse of an inertial reference unit, four gyros, a radar altim-\neter, and a Doppler radar to detect horizontal velocity. The\nsystem was initiated at about 65 m/s (200 ft/s) at an altitude\n\nof 1,200 m (4,000 ft.). The three engines orientated the\nspacecraft so that their combined thrust vector opposed the\nvelocity vector of the spacecraft (i.e. a gravity-turn\nmaneuver). The landing trajectory was maintained between\ntwo preprogrammed limiting altitude/velocity profiles. The\nlander reached a height of about 16.8 m above the surface\nwith a residual velocity of 2.4 m/s and continued to the\nsurface at this velocity. As soon as a sensor on any one of\nthe three footpads touched the surface, the rocket engines\nwere switched off. The system utilized three monopropel-\nlant hydrazine engines separated by 120?. The engines had\n18 nozzles to diffuse the exhaust plume, eliminate con-\ntamination of the spacecraft instrumentation due to recir-\nculation, and avoid erosion of the landing site. The engines\nwere throttleable from 276 to 2,667 N. The 85 kg of pro-\npellant was contained in two spherical titanium tanks\nmounted on opposite sides of the lander.\n\nThe Phoenix system [33] was almost identical to the\nMars Polar Lander system that ended in loss during its\nlanding attempt in 1999. The system was similar to Viking\nbut included several cost reduction features. A canted multi-\nbeam radar was employed to avoid horizontal Doppler radar\nvelocity measurement. Throttled engines were replaced by\ntwelve, 302 N monopropellant hydrazine thrusters off-\npulsed engines operating at high duty cycles.\n\nThe Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) landing system\n[34] took a radical approach to landing system design. For\nlanders of the Viking type, it is important to avoid risks to\nthe system from plume impingement on the regolith. This is\nachieved by descending as rapidly as the landing legs will\n\nFig. 18.14 Parafoil\n\n18 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems 531\n\n\n\nallow. This adversely affects both ground clearance under\nthe vehicle and slope tolerance. Placing the propulsion\nsystem under a rover also presents egress issues. The\nupgrading of MPF/MER propulsion configuration to place\nthrottled monopropellant engines in the backshell above the\nlander solved the problem. In this way, the descent engines\ncould lower the rover to the surface at a much slower\nvelocity. This system, called Sky-crane, removed the need\nfor heavy landing gear (like airbags) and increased the\ntolerance of the lander to slopes and rocks. The powered\ndescent was initiated at an altitude between 1,500 and\n2,000 m above ground level and at a velocity near 100 m/s.\nThe descent stage comprised eight variable thrust mono-\npropellant hydrazine rocket thrusters in pairs on four arms\nextending around this platform. Each rocket thruster pro-\nduced 400\u20133,100 N of thrust. It was derived from those\nused on the Viking landers. The MSL lander flew a Viking-\nlike gravity-turn maneuver to reduce the vertical velocity to\n0.75 m/s and the lateral velocity to zero at 20 m above the\nground. The rover was then lowered on a 7.5 m bridle while\nthe descent velocity was maintained until either touchdown\nor bridle off-load was detected. The rover was then released\nand the Sky-crane performed a flyaway maneuver.\n\n18.4.3.2 Retro Rockets\nThe Mars Pathfinder mission [3] sought considerable cost\nreductions compared to Viking. Its strategy to reduce cost\nwas to use the Viking entry and descent systems (with\npassive attitude control) and use low cost solid rocket\nengines that would deliver the lander to the surface with\nmuch larger range of touchdown velocities than legged\nlanders could typically handle, necessitating the develop-\nment of the tetrahedral airbag (Sect. 18.5.2). This also\nremoved the requirement for horizontal velocity estimation\nwith a Doppler radar. At 1.6 km above the surface, while\ndescending on the parachute, a radar altimeter was used to\ndetermine both the altitude and descent velocity; this\ninformation was then used by the on-board computer to\ndetermine the precise timing of the landing events. The\nairbags were inflated at 355 m above the ground. The three\nsolid retro-rockets mounted above the lander in the back-\nshell were fired at a height of 98 m. When the computer\nestimated the lander was stationary at a height between 15\nand 25 m the bridle was cut and the payload fell to the\nground, protected by the airbag system. The rockets flew up\nand away with the backshell and parachute.\n\nThe Mars Exploration Rovers [35] employed a similar\nretro-rocket system, but enhanced with a simplified form of\nhorizontal velocity control in the form of the transverse\nimpulse rocket system (TIRS). The TIRS does not provide a\nmeans of countering steady-state wind velocity, it is\ndesigned to mitigate wind shear and gust effects at the\n\nmoment of retro-rocket fire by ensuring that the angle\nbetween the retro-rocket thrust line is close to the local\nvertical. The TIRS consists of three small rocket motors,\nspaced at 120? increments around the back cover, with an\ninertial measurement unit to measure the tilt angle and the\nangular acceleration of the back cover. At the time of retro-\nrocket ignition, a variable thrust vector is applied to the\nback cover by the TIRS motors to counteract undesirable\nlateral motion (Fig. 18.15).\n\nA modification to the TIRS system called DIMES was\nimplemented when it was realized that the predicted winds at\nthe first landing site could exceed the airbag capability. This\nallowed the system to reduce the steady-state drift velocity\nof the lander. Using a simple descent camera system, three\npictures were taken at 5 s intervals during the terminal\ndescent in order to calculate an approximate horizontal drift\nvelocity. The TIRS could then be fired to modify the retro-\nrocket thrust line and thus counteract the drift, whilst also\nminimizing unwanted wind shear induced tilt.\n\n18.4.4 Other Descent Systems\n\nGliding vehicles (e.g. Space Shuttle orbiter, Buran, X-38)\nuse aerodynamic lift to control their descent rate and land\non either a conventional aircraft undercarriage or skids.\nSuch systems need a large area of flat, smooth terrain so are\ncurrently only appropriate for Earth return.\n\nAutorotating helicopter-like blades have been considered\nfor Mars landings [36] and have been studied for landing\ncrewed capsules.\n\nBalloons were used on the Vega Venus missions to\nmaintain an altitude of 54 km above the surface of the\nplanet and have been considered for Titan exploration [37].\n\n18.5 Landing\n\nThe landing system operates from first impact with the\nground until the vehicle comes to complete rest. During this\ntime, it must absorb all residual energy and protect the\npayload.\n\nIn general, the more complex the terminal descent sys-\ntem the less complex the landing system needs to be.\nLanders with sophisticated controlled propulsive systems\nthat are able to deliver the vehicle to the surface with small\nvertical and lateral velocities need only landing legs (Vik-\ning, Phoenix), crushable structures (ExoMars 2016), or the\nsuspension of the rover (Mars Science Laboratory). Less\nsophisticated descent systems such as MPF, MER, and\nBeagle-2 needed airbags to protect the lander from the\nsignificantly increased range of landing velocities [38].\n\n532 S. Lingard and J. Underwood\n\n\n\n18.5.1 Landing Legs/Crushable Structures\n\nThree deployable landing legs [33] provide a simple, reli-\nable landing system. Landing legs have been used on past\nplanetary landers, such as Surveyor, Apollo, Viking, and\nPhoenix. Rocks and slopes are the main hazard for this type\nof landing system. They are usually of inverted tripod or\ncantilever construction, with a crushable honeycomb shock\nabsorber in one of the struts. Landers to date have had from\n20 to 30 cm of ground clearance (after leg stroke for\nlanding load attenuation) to avoid rock contact with the\nbelly of the lander. Clearance is also required for the pro-\npulsion system. The terminal descent system can only be\nclose to the ground for a very short time if it is to avoid\nsevere regolith disturbance. For this reason, legged landers\nwith integrated propulsion systems approach the ground at a\nrelatively high speed (2.4 m/s) with a consequently\nincreased susceptibility to slope-induced tip-over hazards.\nThe ground is sensed by pads in the lander foot. The pro-\npulsion system is shut down immediately as first ground\ncontact is made. Equipping the belly of the lander with a\ncrushable structure is an even simpler approach.\n\n18.5.2 Airbags\n\nThere are two types of airbag system: non-vented and\nvented. Non-vented systems act like bouncy balls and\ngradually bring the payload to rest while dissipating the\nimpact energy. Vented systems seek to absorb the impact\nenergy by compression of the airbag gas and immediately\nrelease the compressed gas to prevent a rebound. All of the\nextra-terrestrial landing systems that have flown to date\n(Table 18.3) have been non-vented systems.\n\nAirbags were first used as planetary landing systems in\nthe 1960s by Semyon Lavochkin (1900\u20131960) and Georgy\nBabakin (1914\u20131971) in Russia on some of the Luna series\nof Moon landers. The next use of airbag systems for extra-\nterrestrial missions was not until 1996 with the launch of the\nRussian Space Forces (RSF) Mars 96 and the NASA Mars\n\nPathfinder [39]. Mars 96 did not reach its destination owing\nto a failure of the final stage during launch, but Pathfinder\nwas highly successful and airbags were therefore chosen for\nthe NASA MER missions launched in 2003 [40]. Within\nEurope, an airbag landing system was developed for the\nBeagle-2 lander [41], which was flown as part of the 2003\nESA Mars Express mission, but with unknown results. An\nairbag system was originally baselined for the ESA Exo-\nMars mission, with both non-vented and vented systems\nproceeding through to the phase-B stage before they were\nreplaced by a propulsive descent and landing system.\n\nAirbags have also been studied as landing or impact load\nattenuation systems for the Orion capsule [42] and the\nKistler K1 rocket [43] to cushion the landing when\nreturning to Earth. These airbags were of the vented type.\n\nNon-vented airbags protect the lander by preventing\ncontact with rocks or the ground and limiting the acceler-\nations to which it is exposed. The airbag may take several\nbounces to come to rest, because to dissipate the kinetic\nenergy of the vehicle it relies on thermodynamic losses\nduring the compression and expansion of the gas in the\nairbag, friction between the airbag and the ground, and the\nwork done during the stretching and relaxation of the airbag\nmaterial. Due to the longer operational period of a non-\nvented airbag system and the possibility of multiple boun-\nces and impacts with the ground before the payload comes\nto rest, the airbags must fully encompass the payload and\nmaintain their structural integrity and gas-tightness for a\nmuch longer period than a vented system. Additionally,\npressure loss due to cooling of the inflation gas and heat\ntransfer to the environment is of greater concern for non-\nvented systems; both MPF and MER featured \u2018sustain\ncharges\u2019 to manage the loss in pressure due to cooling.\nAlthough non-vented systems are heavy, this is mitigated by\nthe greater simplicity of the system and the reduced sensi-\ntivity to attitude, lateral velocity, and slopes during impact.\nThe uncontrolled nature of the landing sequence with a non-\nvented system means that it is almost impossible to guar-\nantee the orientation of the payload when the system comes\nto rest. As a result, some form of self-righting mechanism is\n\nFig. 18.15 Transverse impulse\nrocket system (TIRS) operation\ndiagram\n\n18 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems 533\n\n\n\nrequired, either as part of the payload deployment or as a\nby-product of the airbag deflation or jettisoning process.\nMajor design drivers for these systems are high lateral\nvelocities, which increase the potential for abrasion damage\nand cause increased impact velocities in conjunction with\nslopes. Encounters with large pointed rocks are also a major\nsource of failure due to puncture or tear damage.\n\nSeveral geometries have been used. MPF and MER used\na tetrahedral \u2018billiard rack\u2019 design, as seen in Fig. 18.16.\nAfter coming to rest the airbags were deflated, the lander\nrighted, and the airbags retracted under the landing cage\nstructure that protected the rover, as seen in Fig. 18.17.\nBeagle-2 used spherical airbags comprising three separable\nsegments. When the bag stopped, the segments were to be\nreleased and separated by venting residual pressure, leaving\nthe lander to fall to the surface from a height of approxi-\nmately the radius of the airbag. A double toroid geometry\nhas also been studied for small Mars landers.\n\nVented airbags are more complex than non-vented sys-\ntems, requiring a degree of control to ensure optimal\noperation. Rather than relying on thermodynamic losses\nthrough successive compression and re-expansion of the\ninflation gas in order to dissipate energy, vented systems\noperate by compressing the inflation gas during the impact\nand then releasing the gas to the external environment\nbefore it can re-expand. This allows a vented system to stop\nthe lander during a single impact event. The primary chal-\nlenge for vented systems is to control the payload dynamics\nduring and after venting, to prevent tip over. This challenge\nis exacerbated by high lateral velocities, slopes, and rocks.\nVented systems are not very efficient at reducing horizontal\nor tangential velocities, and they rely on interaction of the\nlander with the terrain to remove the residual motion along\nthe surface. It is during this phase that the lander is at the\ngreatest risk of turning over. A vented airbag system that\nstops on the first bounce is tolerant to slow punctures and\nabrasions that cause a gradual loss in pressure, and offers\nlower system mass since only the underside of the payload\nneeds protection.\n\nVented airbags are typically divided into several seg-\nments, with each segment separately vented. Control of\nventing based on acceleration sensors and laser range\nfinders has been investigated. A particular challenge for\nMars landing is that that low ambient pressure means that\n\nthe gas flow from the bag at venting is at sonic velocity,\nleading to rapid and complete venting of the segment. At\nterrestrial ambient pressure the gas vents at subsonic\nvelocity and the segment rapidly reaches ambient pressure,\nwith the remaining deflation being slow. Mars system\nventing therefore needs to be considerably more accurate in\norder to control the lander dynamics.\n\nStudies for the ExoMars program showed that to achieve\na high probability of landing success the lateral velocity for\na vented system had to be controlled, necessitating a pro-\npulsive descent system which itself removed the need for an\nairbag system since the vertical velocity was also controlled\nand a crushable structure provided an adequate landing\nsystem.\n\n18.5.3 Mid-Air Retrieval\n\nThe use of mid-air retrieval avoids a landing system entirely\nfor Earth return missions. For Genesis it was planned that a\nhelicopter would snag the parafoil descent system in mid-air\nand then fly the probe to the ground [15]. It should however\nbe noted that planetary protection best-practice typically\nrequires a high probability of any sample canister remaining\nintact, and hence sealed, in the event of a total failure of the\nEDL system. This requirement can drive an Earth return to\nadopt this as the default mission baseline.\n\n18.6 Modeling and Simulation\n\nEntry, descent and landing systems for space vehicles rely\nheavily on modeling and simulation throughout the design,\ndevelopment, and qualification process. During the design\nphase, computer modeling allows the EDL sequence to be\noptimized and the system components to be sized. During\ndevelopment and qualification, modeling allows appropriate\ntest conditions to be derived and test results to be cross-\nreferenced against mission conditions. Simulations are far\nmore important for space missions than terrestrial descent\nand landing systems, since it is generally impossible to test\nhardware in conditions which are completely representative\nof the mission environments (e.g. gravity, atmosphere\ndensity, and composition).\n\nTable 18.3 Historical use of airbag systems for extra-terrestrial space missions\n\nMission Configuration Payload mass Airbag system mass\n\nUSSR Luna 9 and others (1960s) Non-vented\u2014spherical 99 kg \u2013\n\nRSF Mars 96 (1996) Non-vented\u2014spherical 12 kg \u2013\n\nNASA Mars Pathfinder (1996) Non-vented\u2014billiard rack 290 kg 99 kg\n\nUK/ESA Beagle 2 (2003) Non-vented\u2014spherical 35 kg 15 kg\n\nNASA Mars Exploration Rovers (2003) Non-vented\u2014billiard rack 415 kg 125 kg\n\n534 S. Lingard and J. Underwood\n\n\n\n18.6.1 Typical Simulation Tools\n\nA number of simulation tools are used in the design of an\nEDL system. Some are specific to EDL design, others are\nmore general. The specialized tools include the following.\n\u2022 Trajectory simulation tools are used to simulate the entire\n\ntime from atmospheric entry to landing. They vary from\nsimple, three degrees of freedom (3dof), point-mass tools\nto complex multi-body, six degrees of freedom (6dof)\nmodels that include interactions between the bodies.\nThese are described in more detail later in this section.\n\nExamples include the NASA POST2 [44] tool and the\nESA EAGLE software [45]. Most aerospace companies\nalso have customized in-house tools with similar\ncapabilities.\n\n\u2022 Entry thermodynamics tools model the performance of\nablative thermal protection systems throughout the entry\nphase. These models predict the heat flux onto the ther-\nmal protection system (both radiative and convective)\nand the response of the thermal protection material. They\nrange in fidelity from simple empirical models to those\nusing quantum chemistry to model the hypersonic flow\n\nFig. 18.16 MER airbags\ntetrahedral \u2018billiard rack\u2019 design.\nImage NASA/JPL/Cornell\n\nFig. 18.17 Image mosaic taken\nby the panoramic camera on-\nboard the Mars Exploration\nRover Spirit showing the rover\u2019s\nlanding site, the Columbia\nMemorial Station, at Gusev\nCrater, Mars. The airbags are\nseen underneath the rover\nplatform. Image NASA/JPL/\nCornell\n\n18 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems 535\n\n\n\nphysics, conventional chemistry to model the dissociation\nof the TPS, and CFD to model the flow of the ablation\nproducts from the aeroshell.\n\n\u2022 Inflation models are used to predict the inflation process\nof parachutes. These may be low-fidelity models built\ninto trajectory simulation tools for system sizing or high-\nfidelity models that facilitate detailed stressing of the\nparachute and payload.\n\n18.6.2 Development Process\n\nSimulations are used in different ways throughout the\ndevelopment process of any EDL system. The fidelity of the\nsimulation will usually increase as the design matures.\n\nDuring the conceptual design phase, the objective is to\nsize the overall EDL system within the mission constraints\n(e.g. allowable acceleration, entry angles, and landing site\naltitudes). The initial analysis is generally performed using\na model that incorporates empirical models of heat flux,\nthermal protection system performance, and aerodynamics.\nThis allows design options to be traded (e.g. the number of\nparachutes and the type of landing system), for the key\ncomponents to be sized, and for the initial mass estimates to\nbe made.\n\nOnce a design has been chosen, its performance can be\nassessed throughout the operational envelope using the\nsame trajectory tool in a Monte-Carlo mode. This allows\nthousands of simulations to be run while varying initial\nstates, environmental conditions, and system parameters, in\norder to assess the robustness of the chosen design and\nchoose the design parameters.\n\nThe detailed design of the entry, descent, and landing\nsubsystems will make use of specific tools to predict the\nperformance at each stage. Examples are parachute\ndeployment and inflation and airbag operation. Multi-body,\n6dof tools are frequently used to predict the relative motion\nof the components that are released during the sequence to\nensure that none of these items will subsequently interfere\nwith the entry vehicle.\n\nDuring the development phase, test data are used to\nenhance the fidelity of the simulations. Since the mission\nenvironment cannot generally be replicated on Earth, the\nsimulations are run using both Earth test conditions and\nmission conditions. They are validated against test condi-\ntions on Earth, and then used to extrapolate and calculate\nthe likely performance under mission conditions.\n\n18.6.3 The Anatomy of Simulations\n\nSimulations bring together models of physical processes\n(either empirical or physics-based) and environments\n\nemploying numerical methods for their solution. These are\nfrequently produced as standard libraries or building blocks\nwhich may subsequently be used in different software and\nfor different purposes; for example an atmosphere model for\na planet may be used in dynamic simulations, parachute\ninflation simulations, or landing predictions.\n\nModels may be produced for differing levels of fidelity,\nranging from simple empirical models to detailed physical\nmodels. The former will require little computing power and\nmay be used for initial design and iterative tasks such as\nMonte-Carlo simulations, whereas the latter may require\nmuch greater resources and be suitable for high-fidelity\npredictions of the final mission design.\n\nThe key building blocks of simulations are described in\nthe following sections.\n\n18.6.4 Reference Frames\n\nSince EDL sequences occur on (nearly) spherical, rotating\nplanets and moons, the choice of simulation reference frame\nis important. The distances covered during entry and des-\ncent are generally sufficiently great that a flat planet model\ncannot be used; however, it may be useful for terminal\ndescent and landing simulations. For a three-dimensional\nplanet model, the reference frame may be inertial (fixed\nwith respect to space) or rotating (fixed with respect to the\nplanet). Both solutions have been used and have different\nchallenges. If a rotating reference frame is used, care must\nbe taken to consider Coriolis effects.\n\n18.6.5 Atmosphere Models\n\nWherever a target body possesses an atmosphere, this is\ninevitably utilized during the EDL process. In order to\ndesign the mission, atmosphere models are required. For\ninitial mission design, these can be as simple as a single\ndensity profile with altitude; for detailed design, additional\nparameters and their variation must be considered.\n\nThe density profile is the most important atmospheric\nproperty for the design of an EDL system since it, along\nwith airspeed, determines the aerodynamic force on an entry\nvehicle. For some destination, such as Earth, the atmosphere\nis sufficiently dense and homogenous that the majority of\nmission design can take place using a single density profile;\nfor others, such as Mars, the spatial, diurnal, and seasonal\nvariations in the atmosphere are significant and must be\nconsidered from the earliest stages of mission design.\n\nThe temperature profile is important to define the speed\nof sound in the atmosphere, and thus the Mach number\nduring the EDL operation. It can also be important for the\nchoice of materials for the descent and landing systems.\n\n536 S. Lingard and J. Underwood\n\n\n\nThe thermodynamic and transport properties of the atmo-\nsphere allow determination of the flow characteristics around\nthe vehicle by reference to dimensionless quantities such as\nthe Mach, Reynolds, and Strouhal numbers of the flow.\n\nPerturbation models are necessary for detailed design of\nthe descent and landing systems. The principal perturbation\nof interest is wind. The magnitude of the wind determines\nthe ground speed of the payload during the terminal descent\nand thereby the lateral velocity requirements for the landing\nsystem, since any aerodynamic system will operate in a\nwind-relative frame. The rate of change of wind velocity\nwith altitude (wind shear) and time (wind gusts) affects the\nstability of a payload under a parachute and the ability of a\npowered descent system to control a vehicle. Knowledge of\nthe wind characteristics may be used to optimize the system\ngeometry and to set requirements for key components such\nas landing radar.\n\nPerturbations may be generated on several scales. They\nare generally split into two classes: large scale, with length\nscales of several kilometers caused, for instance, by atmo-\nspheric gravity waves; and small scale, with length scales of\ntens of meters and less, caused by atmospheric turbulence.\nTypical engineering atmosphere models predict randomized\nperturbations based on global conditions, and are suffi-\nciently accurate for initial mission design, but local climate\nmodeling (meso-scale modeling) may be required for the\nintended landing site if the effects of wind are critical.\n\nWhen using atmosphere models as part of a dynamic\nsimulation, care must be taken over the integration of the\natmosphere model with the terrain model (in order to\ndetermine when the vehicle has reached terminal condi-\ntions). The atmospheric datum (zero altitude) rarely corre-\nsponds to ground level. Usually it relates to a surface with a\ngiven gravitational potential; however, for some planets\nseveral \u2018standard\u2019 reference surfaces have been defined.\n\nEngineering models for most potential destinations have\nbeen produced. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center has\nproduced models in the GRAM (Global Reference Atmo-\nsphere Model) for Venus, Earth, Mars, Neptune, and Titan,\nall of which feature atmospheres with random perturbations.\nOther organizations have also produced a selection of\natmosphere models.\n\nThe atmosphere of Venus has a surface density of 66 kg/\nm3 and a pressure of 95 bars. Standard atmosphere profiles\nsuch as the Venus International Reference Atmosphere\n(VIRA) [46] may be used for initial mission design. Ve-\nnusGRAM [47], which includes perturbations, may be\nconsidered for more realistic mission design.\n\nThe atmosphere of Earth has obviously been studied in\nfar greater detail than those of the other planets and many\nengineering models are available. For initial studies, the\nICAO standard atmosphere [48] is usually sufficient.\nExtreme atmosphere profiles have been documented by the\n\nUS Department of Defense [49] up to an altitude of 80 km.\nFor profiles to the upper limits of the atmosphere, the NRL\nMSISE-00 [50] model predicts density and temperature as a\nfunction of latitude, longitude, altitude, and time. It is freely\navailable but does not include perturbations. The Earth-\nGRAM [51] model may be used if random perturbations are\nrequired.\n\nDue to the tenuous nature of the atmosphere of Mars and\nits temporal variability, single standard profiles are not\nsuitable for mission design. Two global engineering models\nare in common use: MarsGRAM and the European Mars\nClimate Database (EMCD). The latter constructs conditions\nusing databases that include mean conditions and variability\nderived from full-planet climatic simulations.\n\nFor the gas giants (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune),\nthe only engineering model known to the authors is Nep-\ntuneGRAM. For missions to these planets, an early task\nmay be the construction of such an atmosphere if required,\nhowever this would be a mission specific task.\n\nThe final target of interest, and the only moon in the solar\nsystem with a viable atmosphere, is Saturn\u2019s moon, Titan.\nSeveral engineering models have been produced for Titan\nincluding those by Lellouche and Hunten [52], Yelle [53],\nand TitanGRAM.\n\nA good summary of atmosphere engineering models has\nbeen produced by the AIAA [54].\n\n18.6.6 Gravity Models\n\nVery accurate gravitational models are required in order to\npredict orbital evolution accurately. For entry simulations\nhowever, the aerodynamic forces on the entry body dwarf\nall but the lowest order terms. Furthermore, the errors due to\nuncertainties in atmosphere and aerodynamics knowledge\nwill far exceed the effect of the higher order gravitational\nterms. Generally, no more than the second order gravita-\ntional term need be considered.\n\n18.6.7 Aerodynamics\n\nIn order to predict the trajectory of an entry vehicle through\nan atmosphere, the aerodynamics of the vehicle must be\nknown. As discussed in Chap. 5, the flight of an entry\nvehicle will encompass all flow regimes from free molec-\nular to continuum and from hypersonic to subsonic. For\nmission design, good estimates of the aerodynamics of the\nvehicle must be used. Many papers describing the aerody-\nnamics of past systems have been published and these are\nuseful for initial system design. As the mission design\nmatures, it is often necessary to supplement the literature\nvalues using either CFD or testing.\n\n18 Entry, Descent and Landing Systems 537\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_5\n\n\n18.6.8 Dynamics\n\nTwo classes of simulation are used during mission design\nand validation: three degrees of freedom (3dof) and six\ndegrees of freedom (6dof).\n\nThree degrees of freedom simulations model the object(s)\nunder consideration in terms of point masses. These are only\nuseful for ballistic entries (i.e. non-lifting), although the\naddition of a fourth degree of freedom for simple lifting\nbodies is possible. These are useful for initial mission design,\nand may indeed be used for trajectory modeling throughout\nmission preparation for non-lifting systems. Their simplicity\nallows trajectories to be calculated very quickly.\n\nSix degrees of freedom simulations model the position and\norientation of each body under consideration (i.e. 3 element\nlinear position and 3 element rotational position). Each body\n(e.g. entry vehicle, released heat shield, parachutes, and so\nforth) is modeled as a separate body with its own dynamics\nand aerodynamics. Bodies may be connected (e.g. para-\nchutes) using elastic members which enable the force transfer\nto be represented and quantified. These simulations facilitate\ndetailed modeling of stability during entry, the dynamics of\nseparation and re-contact events, the forces in parachute\nrisers, and many other aspects of the performance of a sys-\ntem. However, they are complex and time-consuming to\nconfigure. While a 3dof simulation needs only mass and\naerodynamic drag for each object, a 6dof simulation requires\nmasses, inertias, full aerodynamics, center of gravity posi-\ntions and attachment positions for each object.\n\n18.6.9 Simulation Features\n\nThe ability to perform Monte-Carlo runs is essential in\nmodeling EDL systems. There are always uncertainties in\nthe properties of the target body and indeed those of the\nspacecraft. It is not generally worthwhile, or practical, to\ndesign a system for all combinations of worst-case condi-\ntions, so a Monte-Carlo approach is usually adopted to\ndefine design cases. This can involve randomizing the\nvalues of tens of properties for a typical system. The sim-\nulation software should be capable of performing these\nrandomized simulations and analyzing the output files in\norder to produce descriptive statistics. This may be achieved\neither as part of the main software or using a driver program\nto run the simulation software in batch mode.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Milos FS, Chen YK, Squire TH, Brewer RA.

First, a general definition of a robot and an overview\nof the historical development of space robots are provided.\nThen technical details of orbital space robots, planetary\nrobots, and telerobotics are given in the subsequent\nsections.\n\nThe term \u2018robot\u2019 comes from the word \u2018robota\u2019, which\nmeans serf labor or hard work in the Slavic languages\n(Czech, Slovak and Polish). It was largely introduced to the\n\npublic by the Czech writer Karel C\n^\n\napek (1890\u20131938) in his\nplay R.U.R. (Rossum\u2019s Universal Robots), which was pre-\nmiered in 1920. In this play, the robots are described as\nartificial creatures, or androids, which can be mistaken for\nhumans.\n\nToday, the word robot is used for an intelligent machine\nor artificial agent that can exhibit interactive behavior with\nits environment or a human in a coordinated manner.\nAlthough humanoids, or human-looking robots, have\nattracted public attention, the typical robots used in industry\nare automated or programmable handling devices that do\nnot necessarily look like humans. Actually, many such\nindustrial robots are successfully working in the mass-pro-\nduction lines of industrial factories, conducting repetitive\n\ntasks such as welding or assembling motor vehicles. How-\never, the majority of research efforts now involve robots\nthat can work outside the factory, such as in offices, homes\nand hospitals, or in outdoor fields or outer space (space\nrobot, the focus of this chapter), or even in inner space\n(medical robots, which can work inside the human body).\nRobotics is a discipline involving system integration, which\nforms the basis for most of our knowledge of many different\nsubject areas including mechanics, electronics, computer\ntechnology, and bioengineering, along with various topics\nin human sciences, such as anthropology and sociology.\n\nAutonomy is a key issue in robotics, and at a primitive\nlevel, any non-crewed spacecraft that is under automated\nsequence control may be referred to as a robotic satellite.\nHowever, when the term space robot is used it implies a\nmore capable mechanical system that can facilitate manip-\nulation, assembly, or service tasks in orbit as an assistant to\nastronauts, or can extend the areas and abilities of explo-\nration on remote planets as a surrogate for human explorers.\n\nThe key issues in space robotics are characterized as\nfollows\n\u2022 Manipulation\u2014Although manipulation is a basic tech-\n\nnology in robotics, the microgravity of the orbital envi-\nronment requires special attention to the motion\ndynamics of the manipulator arms and the objects being\nhandled. The reaction dynamics that affect the base body,\nimpact dynamics when the robotic hand contacts an\nobject to be handled, and vibration dynamics due to\nstructural flexibility are included in this issue. Technical\ndetails of the manipulator control in the microgravity\nenvironment are elaborated in Sect. 19.2.\n\n\u2022 Mobility\u2014Locomotion is particularly important in\nexploration robots (rovers) that travel on the surface of a\nmoon or planet. These surfaces are natural and rough, and\nthus challenging to traverse. Sensing and perception,\ntraction mechanics, and vehicle dynamics, control and\nnavigation are all mobile robotics technologies that must\n\nK.

In early\norbital robotics demonstrations, this latency was typically\na few seconds, but can be several tens of minutes, or even\nhours for planetary missions. Telerobotics technology is\ntherefore indispensable in space exploration, and the\nintroduction of autonomy is a reasonable consequence.\nTechnical details of the telerobotics are elaborated in\nSect. 19.4.\n\n\u2022 Extreme Environments\u2014In addition to the microgravity\nenvironment, which affects the motion dynamics of a\nrobot, there are many other issues related to extreme\nspace environments that are challenging and must be\nsolved to enable practical engineering applications. Such\nissues include extremely high or low temperatures, high\nvacuum or high pressure, corrosive atmospheres, ionizing\nradiation, and very fine dust, and were discussed in detail\nin Chap. 3.\n\n\u2022 Versatility\u2014This is the ultimate goal when designing and\ndeveloping a robot, and is especially highlighted in space\napplications. Due to the nature of space missions, once\nlaunched into space, a robot must perform all of its tasks\nby itself using its own resources. A space robot, therefore,\nshould be adaptable to the extreme space environments\nmentioned above and possess the versatility to handle\nmany different situations and scenarios, including con-\ntingent ones that arise unexpectedly.\n\n19.1 Overview of the Historical Development\nof Space Robots\n\n19.1.1 Orbital Space Robots\n\nThe first robotic manipulator arm used in the orbital envi-\nronment was the Space Shuttle Remote Manipulator System\n(SRMS). It was successfully demonstrated in the STS-2\nmission in 1981. This success opened a new era of orbital\nrobotics and inspired numerous mission concepts.\n\nA long-term goal that has been discussed extensively\nsince the early 1980s is the application of a robotic free-\nflyer or free-flying space robot to the rescue and servicing of\nmalfunctioning spacecraft (for example, the ARAMIS\nreport [1]). In later years, crewed service missions were\nconducted for the capture-repair-deploy procedure of a\nmalfunctioning satellite (Intelsat 603 by STS-49, for\nexample) and for the maintenance of the Hubble Space\nTelescope (STS-61, -82, -103, -109 and -125). In each of\nthese examples, the Space Shuttle, a crewed spacecraft with\n\ndedicated maneuverability, was used.1 In contrast, non-\ncrewed servicing missions have not yet become operational.\nAlthough there have been several demonstration flights such\nas ETS-VII and Orbital Express, the practical technologies\nfor non-crewed satellite servicing missions await the out-\ncomes of future challenges.\n\n19.1.1.1 Space Shuttle Remote Manipulator\nSystem\n\nOn-board the Space Shuttle, the Shuttle Remote Manipu-\nlator System (SRMS), or Canadarm, was a mechanical arm\nthat handled a payload from the payload bay of the Space\nShuttle orbiter. It could also grapple a free-flying payload\nand maneuver it into the payload bay. The SRMS was first\nused on mission STS-2, launched in 1981. It was used more\nthan 100 times during subsequent missions, performing\npayload deployment and retrieval, as well as assisting in\nhuman extra vehicular activities (EVA) or space walks.2\n\nServicing and maintenance missions to the Hubble Space\nTelescope and construction tasks for the International Space\nStation were also carried out by the cooperative use of the\nSRMS in human EVAs.\n\nThe SRMS arm was 15 m long and had six degrees of\nfreedom (DOF), comprising shoulder yaw and pitch joints,\nan elbow pitch joint, and wrist pitch, yaw, and roll joints.\nAttached to the end of the arm was a special gripper system\n\nFig. 19.1 Space shuttle remote manipulator system (SRMS) used as a\nplatform for an astronaut\u2019s extravehicular activity in the Shuttle cargo\nbay. Image NASA/CSA\n\n1 A robotic maintenance mission of the Hubble Space Telescope was\nseriously studied after the Space Shuttle Columbia accident (STS-\n107), but it was finally conducted as a crewed mission by STS-125.\n2 Five arms were built in total but one was destroyed in the\nChallenger accident in 1986.\n\n542 K. Yoshida et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_3\n\n\ncalled the Standard End Effector (SEE), which was\ndesigned to grapple a pole-like fixture (GF) attached to the\npayload. By attaching a foothold at the end point, the arm\ncould serve as a mobile platform for an astronaut\u2019s EVA,\nsee Fig. 19.1.\n\n19.1.1.2 International Space Station Mounted\nRobot Manipulator Systems\n\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is the largest inter-\nnational space project to-date, with 15 countries making\nsignificant cooperative contributions. The ISS is an outpost\nfor the human presence in space, as well as a flying labo-\nratory with substantial facilities for science and engineering\nresearch. To facilitate various activities on the station, there\nare several robotic systems.\n\nThe Space Station Remote Manipulator System\n(SSRMS), or Canadarm2, see Fig. 19.2, is an extended\nversion of SRMS for use on the ISS. Launched in 2001 by\nSTS-100 (ISS assembly flight 6A), the SSRMS has played a\nkey role in the construction and maintenance of the ISS both\nby assisting astronauts during EVAs and in the use of the\nSRMS to hand over a payload from the Shuttle to the\nSSRMS. As for extensive capability, the SSRMS was\ndesigned as a symmetric seven-DOF arm with offset joints\nto enable it to be folded in half in the stored configuration\nand it provides system redundancy in operation. Its total\nlength is 17.6 m when fully extended. Latching End\nEffectors are attached to both ends, through which power,\ndata, and video can be transmitted to and from the arm. The\nSSRMS is self-relocatable using an inchworm-like move-\nment with alternate grappling of Power Data Grapple Fix-\ntures (PDGF), which are installed all over the station\u2019s\n\nexterior surfaces to provide the power, data, and video, as\nwell as a footholds. As another mobility aid to allow the\nSSRSM to cover wider areas of the ISS, Mobile Base\nSystem (MBS) was added in 2002 by STS-111 (ISS\nassembly flight UF-2). The MBS provides lateral mobility\nas it traverses the rails on the main trusses.\n\nThe Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM),\nor Dextre, which was attached at the end of the SSRM in\n2008 by STS-123 (ISS assembly flight 1J/A), is a capable\nmini-arm system that facilitates the delicate assembly\ntasks currently handled by astronauts during EVAs. The\nSPDM is a dual-arm manipulator system, where each\nmanipulator has seven DOFs and is mounted on a one-\nDOF body joint. Each arm has a special tool mechanism\ndedicated to the handling of standardized orbital replace-\nment units (ORU) [2].\n\nThe Japan Space Exploration Agency (JAXA) also pro-\nvided orbital assets including a robotic manipulator system\nfor the ISS. The Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), which\nis also known by the nickname Kibo is composed of a\npressurized module, exposed facility, experiment logistics\nmodule, and remote manipulator system (JEMRMS), see\nFig. 19.3. These modules were developed by JAXA and\nsuccessfully incorporated into the ISS by STS-123, 124 and\n127 in 2008\u20132009.\n\nThe JEMRMS comprises two components: the main arm,\nwhich is a 9.9-m-long, six-DOF arm, and the small fine arm,\nwhich is a 1.9-m-long, six-DOF arm. Unlike the SSRMS,\nthe main arm does not have self-relocation capability. Since\nits installation, the arm has been used to handle and relocate\ncomponents for the experiments and observations per-\nformed in the exposed facility.\n\nFig. 19.2 Space station remote\nmanipulator system (SSRMS)\ngrapples the Japan Aerospace\nExploration Agency (JAXA) H-II\ntransfer vehicle (HTV) prior to\nberthing it to the station. Image\nNASA\n\n19 Space Robotics 543\n\n\n\n19.1.1.3 ROTEX and ROKVISS\nThe robot technology experiment, ROTEX, which was\ndeveloped by the German Aerospace Agency (DLR), is one\nof the historical milestones of robotics technology in space\n[3]. A multisensory robotic arm was flown on the Space\nShuttle Columbia (STS-55) in 1993. Although the robot was\nconfined to a work cell on the Shuttle, several key tech-\nnologies were successfully tested, including those for a\nmultisensory gripper, teleoperation from the ground and by\nthe astronauts, shared autonomy, and time-delay compen-\nsation by the use of a predictive graphic display.\n\nDLR also developed a two-joint manipulator system\ncalled ROKVISS, which was installed on the exterior of the\nRussian Service Module of the ISS in January 2005. The\naim of ROKVISS was the in-flight verification of highly\nintegrated modular lightweight robotic joints, as well as that\nof control technology, such as high-level system autonomy\nand force feedback-based teleoperation. The teleoperation\nexperiments were conducted from the ground station via a\ndirect radio link [4]. After 6 years of experiments in space,\nthe ROKVISS flight hardware was brought back to Earth by\na Soyuz return capsule.\n\n19.1.1.4 Orbital Express and ETS-VII: \u2018Orihime\u2019\nand \u2018Hikoboshi\u2019\n\nJapanese Engineering Test Satellite VII was another his-\ntorical milestone in the development of robotics technology\nin space, particularly in the area of satellite servicing. ETS-\nVII was developed and launched by the National Space\nDevelopment Agency of Japan (NASDA, currently JAXA)\nin November 1997. Numerous experiments were\n\nsuccessfully conducted using a 2-m-long, six-DOF manip-\nulator arm mounted on its carrier satellite.\n\nThe mission objective of ETS-VII was to test free-flying\nrobotics technology and to demonstrate its utility in orbital\noperation and servicing tasks. The mission consisted of two\nsubtasks: autonomous rendezvous/docking (RVD) and\nnumerous robot experiments (RBT). For the RVD experi-\nments, the spacecraft was separated into two sub-satellites\nin orbit, one called \u2018Orihime\u2019, which behaved as a target,\nand the other called \u2018Hikoboshi\u2019, which acted as a chaser.\nThe robot experiments included: (1) teleoperation from the\nground with a time delay of 5\u20137 s. (2) Robotic servicing\ntask demonstrations such as orbital replacement unit (ORU)\nexchange, fuel transfer between the satellite and the ORU,\nand deployment of space structures; (3) dynamically coor-\ndinated control between the manipulator reaction and the\nsatellite attitude response; and (4) the capture and berthing\nof a target satellite, all of which were conducted success-\nfully [5, 6].\n\nTen years after ETS-VII, a similar orbital demonstration\nwas conducted under the Orbital Express Space Operations\nArchitecture program by the Defense Advanced Research\nProjects Agency (DARPA) in the United States. The system\nconsisted of the Autonomous Space Transport Robotic\nOperations (ASTRO) vehicle, developed by Boeing Inte-\ngrated Defense Systems, and a prototype modular next-\ngeneration serviceable satellite, NextSat, developed by Ball\nAerospace. The ASTRO vehicle was equipped with a\nrobotic arm to perform satellite capture and ORU exchange\noperations. After its launch in March 2007, various mission\nscenarios were successfully conducted, including visual\n\nFig. 19.3 The Japan Space\nExploration Agency (JAXA)\nmodule, Kibo in orbit; other\nmodules of the International\nSpace Station have been removed\nthrough image manipulation.\nImage creative commons\n\n544 K. Yoshida et al.\n\n\n\ninspection, fuel transfer, ORU exchange, fly-around, ren-\ndezvous, docking and satellite capture. The free-flying\ncapture was conducted autonomously using vision-based\nfeedback [7].\n\n19.1.1.5 Robonaut\nRobonaut is a dexterous humanoid robot designed and built\nat NASA\u2019s Johnson Space Center in the United States.\nBuilding machines that can assist humans to work in and\nexplore space is a key challenge. The Robonauts were\ndesigned to accomplish dexterous manipulation tasks using\nsophisticated human-like hands with tendon-driven fingers\npossessing multiple DOFs. The goal was to achieve dex-\nterity that exceeds that of a suited astronaut. The advantage\nof a human-like robot is that the same workspace and tools\ndesigned for crewed space missions can be used. This not\nonly improves efficiency, but also removes the need for\nspecialized tools or interfaces for performing robotic\noperations.\n\nWork on the first Robonaut began in 1997, and the first\nmodel called Robonaut 1 (R1), came out in 2002. Through\n2006, R1 performed numerous experiments in a variety of\nlaboratory and field test environments, proving that the\nconcept of a robotic assistant was valid. The second gener-\nation Robonaut 2 (R2), was revealed in 2010, see Fig. 19.4.\nIt is more technologically advanced than R1 and was\ndelivered to the ISS by STS-133 in February 2011, becom-\ning the first humanoid orbital robot on-board the ISS [8].\n\nThe Robonaut is a human-torso-like robot that contains\njoints with a total of 42 DOFs. Each arm has 7 DOFs, with a\nhand that has 12-DOF fingers. All the actuators are mounted\nin the arm. The torso contains 38 Power PC processors.\nThere are more than 350 sensors in total, which are used for\nforce/torque control based dexterous manipulation, as well\nas for safety behaviors.\n\nAlthough, at present R2\u2019s primary role on the space\nstation is limited to experiments inside the Destiny labora-\ntory, the future enhancement plan includes the incorporation\nof a lower body to allow it to move around the station\u2019s\ninterior. In addition, future upgrade could enable it to move\noutside to help astronauts with EVA tasks or perform\nrepairs on the exterior of the station. Combined with a\nsurface mobility system like legs or wheels, R2 could per-\nform as a human-like manipulation system for future\nexploration missions on the Moon or Mars.\n\nOrbital space robots will be able to assist humans in\nspace by constructing and maintaining space modules and\nstructures. Robotic manipulators have played essential roles\nin orbital operations. Moreover, satellite servicing missions\nare crucial to prevent the increase of space debris. The\nconcept of servicing robots, or free-flying robots, has been\ndiscussed for many years, but there has been a limited\nnumber of validation flights in orbit, so far. More techno-\nlogical developments are expected to realize free-flying\nrobots for servicing, rescuing or capture-and-removal mis-\nsions of existing spacecraft in orbit.\n\n19.1.2 Planetary Robots\n\n19.1.2.1 Apollo \u2018Moon Buggy\u2019 and Lunokhod\nThe research on lunar surface mobility systems, which\nrepresents the roots of today\u2019s exploration rovers, began in\nthe 1960s, with an initiative to develop a crewed roving\nvehicle (\u2018Moon buggy\u2019, see Fig. 19.5) for the Apollo pro-\ngram in the United States, along with that for a teleoperated\nrover called Lunokhod in the Soviet Union. Both the Apollo\nrovers (Apollo 15\u201317 in 1971\u20131972) and the Lunokhod\nrovers (Lunokhod 1 in 1970 and Lunokhod 2 in 1973) were\nsuccessfully operated on the Moon [9].\n\nFig. 19.4 Robonaut 2. Image\nNASA\n\n19 Space Robotics 545\n\n\n\nThere were numerous engineering design issues that had\nto be overcome to make vehicles work in this extraterrestrial\nenvironment, which contains high radiation, vacuum, severe\ntemperatures and irregular terrain covered with regolith and\ndust. This was particularly true for the Lunokhod rovers,\nwhich had a mass of 840 kg with eight wheels supported by\na dedicated suspension mechanism, and traveled 10.5 km\n(Lunokhod 1) and 37 km (Lunokhod 2) over the lunar terrain\nvia television-image-based teleoperation from the ground\nstation. To keep the rover warm during the long lunar nights,\na polonium-210 radioactive heat source was successfully\nused.\n\n19.1.2.2 Mars Landers: From Viking to Phoenix\nUpon the success of the lunar programs, the exploration\ntarget shifted to Mars. In 1976, two Viking landers (Viking\n1 and Viking 2) developed by NASA landed on the surface\nof Mars. They each had a simple robotic arm to collect\nsurface soil samples and put them into on-board containers\nfor in situ analysis. After the Viking mission, there were\nmultiple missions that were planned and actually launched\nto Mars, but it took about 30 years until the next successful\nlander mission. The Mars Phoenix Lander that successfully\nlanded in a polar region of the Mars in 2008 had a much\nmore sophisticated robotic arm. This robotic arm was\noperated to dig trenches in the Martian regolith and to\nacquire (scoop) dry and icy soil samples and deliver them to\nthe in situ analyzers. It was also able to insert a sensor probe\ninto the soil, and to position sensors and cameras at various\nlocations near the lander.\n\nMeanwhile, the Soviet Union also developed multiple\nmissions to Mars, including orbiters, landers and rovers. In\n1971, the Mars 2 and 3 missions successfully arrived in\nMartian orbit and attempted soft landings of both landing\nmodules, which included a miniature rover; Mars 2 crashed\non the surface, and Mars 3 lost communication soon after\nthe landing. In 1988, two lander missions to Phobos, a moon\n(satellite) of Mars were launched in the Soviet Phobos\nprogram; Phobos-1 suffered a terminal failure en route to\nMars, while Phobos-2 attained Mars orbit and returned 38\nimages of Phobos with a resolution of up to 40 m, but\ncontact was lost prior to deployment of a planned Phobos\nlander. Later, Russia also developed the Mars-96 mission,\nwhich included an orbiter, lander and penetrator, but failed\nat launch. Along with that, a landing and rover mission was\nplanned and the technology, including a rover testbed called\nMarskhod, was developed, but was not launched.\n\n19.1.2.3 Mars Rovers: Pathfinder, MER and MSL\nAutonomous or semi-autonomous robotic vehicles are con-\nsidered as indispensable technology for planetary explora-\ntion. As a precursor mission for mobile robotics technology\non a remote planet, the Mars Pathfinder mission deployed a\nmicro-rover called Sojourner in 1997, see Fig. 19.6. The\nSojourner rover traversed the rocky Martian surface in close\nvicinity to the landing site by autonomously avoiding\nobstacles [10]. Based on this successful technology demon-\nstration, NASA developed larger, more capable twins for the\nMars Exploration Rover (MER) mission, see Fig. 19.7, both\nof which were launched in 2003. The MER-A rover (Spirit)\n\nFig. 19.5 Astronaut Eugene\nA. Cernan, mission commander,\nmakes a short checkout of the\nlunar roving vehicle (LRV)\nduring the early part of the first\nApollo 17 Extravehicular\nActivity at the Taurus-Littrow\nlanding site on December 11,\n1972. Image NASA\n\n546 K. Yoshida et al.\n\n\n\nlanded on the Gusev crater on January 4, 2004, and the MER-\nB rover (Opportunity) landed on the Meridiani Planum on the\nopposite side of Mars from Spirit on January 25, 2004.\n\nBoth Pathfinder and the MER rovers introduced new\ntechnologies. Firstly, for the landing, a combination of an\naerodynamic parachute and a unique airbag system was\ndeveloped. Compared to a conventional lander, which uses\na powered descent and soft landing, the airbag system can\ngreatly reduce the mass of the landing module and its fuel,\nalthough it eliminates the precision landing feature by\nallowing the lander to bounce around on the surface several\ntimes before it finally settles down at a certain position.\n\nSecondly, to achieve rough terrain mobility, these rovers\nuse six independently driven wheels connected by a unique\nsuspension arrangement called the rocker-bogie system.\nThe term \u2018rocker\u2019 comes from the design of the differential\nthat keeps the rover body balanced, enabling it to \u2018rock\u2019\ndepending on the various positions of the multiple wheels.\nThe term \u2018bogie\u2019, on the other hand, comes from the old\nrailroad systems and refers to a train undercarriage with six\nwheels that can swivel to curve along a track. To achieve\nthis performance, the axles of the six wheels are connected\nby a passive linkage mechanism, with no need for springs,\ndampers, or even active elements. Thanks to this mecha-\nnism, the rover can move over a rock obstacle that is larger\nthan the diameter of the wheel. The six-wheel and rocker-\nbogie suspension design was also adopted for NASA\u2019s next\nrover (Curiosity) in the Mars Science Laboratory, which\nlanded on Mars in 2012.\n\nThe MER rovers Spirit and Opportunity have an on-board\nmanipulator arm for scientific operations. At the tip of this\narm, several attached instruments can be placed directly up\n\nagainst a rock or soil target of interest. For example, by using\na rock abrasion tool, the surface of a rock can be scrubbed,\nafter which the interior of the rock can be carefully observed\nusing a microscopic camera and an alpha-particle X-Ray\nspectrometer. On-board the MER rovers, a stereo pair of\nhigh-resolution color CCD cameras are also mounted at the\ntop of the Pancam Mast Assembly. This allows the cameras\nto rotate a full 360? to obtain a panoramic view of the\nMartian landscape. The stereoscopic measurement is used\nfor mapping of the surrounding environment and as a vision-\nbased odometry system for rover navigation [11].\n\nThe Sojourner rover weighs about 10.5 kg and is\napproximately the size of a microwave oven, the Spirit and\nOpportunity rovers weigh about 175 kg and are the size of\ngolf carts, and the Curiosity rover weighs about 900 kg and\nis the size of a car. The Sojourner rover was actively\noperational for almost 3 months and traveled approximately\n100 m in total. The mission of the Spirit rover was termi-\nnated in May 2011 after more than 7 years of operation on\nthe surface. The total traveling distance was 7.73 km. On\nthe other hand, the Opportunity rover remained operational\nthroughout 2012 into 2013, with a cumulative distance\ntraveled of more than 30 km [12].\n\nThe Curiosity rover landed on the Gale Crater on Mars\non 6 August, 2012, see Fig. 19.8. As it is much heavier than\nSojourner, Spirit and Opportunity and a much more precise\nlanding was demanded, it used an innovative soft-landing\nsystem that combined parachute descent, powered descent\nand finally a \u2018sky-crane\u2019 to lower the rover to the surface on\na tether. Despite its great complexity, the landing was\nsuccessful at almost the center of the ellipsoid target area of\nabout 6 km by 20 km [13].\n\nFig. 19.6 In spacecraft\nassembly and encapsulation\nfacility-2 (SAEF-2), Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory workers\nare closing up the metal \u2018petals\u2019\nof the Mars Pathfinder lander.\nThe Sojourner small rover is\nvisible on one of the three petals.\nImage NASA\n\n19 Space Robotics 547\n\n\n\n19.1.2.4 Robotic Probes to Minor Celestial Bodies\nIn our solar system, there are numerous minor celestial\nbodies, such as asteroids, comets and satellites of the major\nplanets, and the investigation of those bodies is also valu-\nable for science. When comet Halley returned to the vicinity\nof the Sun (perihelion) in 1986, multiple space probes,\nincluding the European spacecraft Giotto, were launched to\nconduct detailed observations of the structure of the comet\n\nnucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation. As\nfor asteroids, the first successful mission to rendezvous and\nlong-term observe one was NEAR-Shoemaker, which was\nlaunched in 1996 and arrived at the asteroid 433 Eros in\n2000. Scientific observation continued until the craft finally\ntouched down on the surface of Eros in 2001. Other minor\nbody missions include Deep Space 1 (NASA, launched\n1998), Stardust (NASA, launched 1999), Contour (NASA,\nlaunched 2002 but failed), Rosetta (ESA, launched 2004),\nDeep Impact (NASA, launched 2005), Dawn (NASA,\nlaunched 2007) and Hayabusa (ISAS/JAXA, launched\n2003).\n\nHayabusa was to visit a near-Earth asteroid, acquire\nsample materials from its surface and return them to Earth\nfor detailed analysis. It was developed by the Japanese\nInstitute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), which\nlater became a part of JAXA. The probe was launched in\nMay 2003 from Uchinoura Space Center, Japan and its re-\nentry capsule safely returned to the Woomera Desert of\nAustralia in June 2010, successfully returning dust-like soil\nsamples of the target asteroid 25143 Itokawa.\n\nSample-return is the method of bringing material back\nfrom space instead of taking analysis equipment all the way\nto space. It is the most difficult and ultimate probing\nmethod. However, the material can be analyzed with greater\nprecision using the latest technology on Earth, even if the\nspecimen is very small.\n\nTo achieve the Hayabusa sample-return mission, the\nfollowing three innovative technologies were developed.\nThe first was an ion engine (electric propulsion system).\nHayabusa was equipped with four sets of newly developed\ncathode-less but microwave-discharge ion engines for the\nround trip mission to the target. A single engine had a\nnominal performance of 8 mN of thrust, with 3,000 s of\nspecific impulse. The ion propulsion system worked\n\nFig. 19.7 Artist\u2019s rendering of a\nMars Exploration Rover.

The\ntotal accumulated operational time reached almost 40,000 h\nfor all four ion engines, which consumed 47 kg of xenon\npropellant and provided a total DV of 2,200 m/s [14].\n\nThe second innovative technology was an autonomous\noptical navigation system for conducting a rendezvous\nmaneuver with Itokawa, and then a touch-down operation on\na specific location on the surface of this tiny object (535 9\n294 9 209 m) located at a distance of 300,000,000 km from\nEarth, requiring approximately 33 min (2,000 s) for a round-\ntrip communication [15].\n\nThe third technology involved material sampling in a\nmicrogravity field. The gravity field on Itokawa\u2019s surface is\nestimated to be about 100,000 times less than that of\nEarth\u2019s. This requires a far lower fuel consumption for\nperforming landing and liftoff maneuvers compared to those\nperformed on major planets or the Moon, but the lack of\ngravity makes it difficult to remain in place on the surface\nand acquire samples. Therefore, a \u2018touch-and-go\u2019 type of\nsample acquisition system was developed [16].\n\nThe Rosetta mission was launched in 2004 to the comet\n67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, targeting an encounter in\n2014. The mission objective is to travel to and land upon the\nsurface of the comet to study its nucleus. The Rosetta probe\nis equipped with specially a designed anchor system and\ndrilling mechanism to drill the comet\u2019s surface materials\nand conduct in situ analysis.\n\nThe robots that can land and travel on the lunar or\nplanetary surfaces have been greatly contributing to our\nknowledge of the solar system. Wheeled mobile vehicles or\nrobot rovers are successful on the natural and rough surface\nterrains of the Moon and Mars. Minor celestial bodies, such\nas asteroids and comets, have been also visited by many\nspace probes. Minor bodies are characterized by very weak\ngravity fields; this fact makes the approach and landing\nmaneuvers relatively easier, but the surface locomotion\ndifficult.\n\n19.2 Modeling and Control of Orbital Space\nRobots\n\nOrbital robots are similar to terrestrial robots in that they are\nmachines composed of multiple links jointed together to\nform arm-like structures, called manipulators, which are\ncapable of performing a variety of tasks with specialized\nend-effectors and tools. The joints of the manipulator(s) are\nusually designed as single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) rota-\ntional joints driven by the appropriate actuators.\n\nFrom the perspective of modeling and controlling orbital\nrobots, it is appropriate to distinguish between extra-\nvehicular and intra-vehicular orbital robots. On the one\nhand, representative examples of extra-vehicular robots are\n\nSRMS/SSRMS/JEMRMS and ETS-VII/Orbital Express; on\nthe other hand, an example of an intra-vehicular robot is\nROTEX. Extra-vehicular robots may pose more challenging\nmodeling and control problems than intra-vehicular robots,\nbecause the latter resemble terrestrial robots to a higher\ndegree. Indeed, large-workspace manipulators such as the\nSRMS on the Space Shuttle and the SSRMS/JEMRMS on\nthe International Space Station are known to exhibit struc-\ntural vibrations due to the specific design constraints\nimposed mainly on their mass [18]. Modeling a robot as\nflexible-link [19] and/or flexible-joint [20] manipulators and\nemploying the respective methods of control is crucial for\nminimizing the vibrations [21\u201324].\n\nFurther, and as noted in Sect. 19.1, smaller manipulators\ncan be attached to the end-links of the SSRMS and the\nJEMRMS (SPDM/Dextre and the Small Fine Arm,\nrespectively), thus forming a \u2018macro-mini\u2019 manipulator\nstructure. This leads to further challenges in terms of\nmodeling and robot control. The motions of the mini-\nmanipulator(s) may induce structural vibrations in the large\narm, the joints of which remain locked during mini-\nmanipulator operations. In this case, a flexible-base\nmanipulator model would be appropriate. Hence, a con-\ntroller must be designed that minimizes the reactions\nimposed on the flexible base from the mini-manipulator\nmotions, and/or damps the excited vibrations (i.e. active\ndamping via the mini-manipulator) [25].\n\nAnother class of extra-vehicular orbital robots are free-\nflying robots, e.g. the Space Shuttle with SRMS, ETS-VII or\nOrbital Express, that comprise a manipulator arm mounted\non a satellite base. The base can attain any position and\norientation depending on the forces and moments acting on\nit. The maneuvering capability of the satellite base can be\nachieved in the conventional way, i.e. using jet thrusters and\nthe attitude control system (ACS). Similar to flexible-base\nrobots, the acting forces and moments on the satellite base\nwill also include undesirable reactions when set into motion\nby the manipulator arm. From the viewpoint of a conven-\ntional ACS, these forces are to be regarded as disturbances.\nHowever, such disturbances may not always be accommo-\ndated by the ACS, i.e. when there are inappropriate\nmanipulator accelerations and/or large unknown payloads.\nOne possibility to deal with this problem is to deactivate the\nACS and let the base float freely during manipulator oper-\nation [26]. However, as was the case with the ETS-VII and\nOrbital Express, which used teleoperation from a remote\nsite (Earth), precise orientation of the satellite base is\nrequired for communication. Hence, special controller\ndesign must be realized in order to minimize the manipu-\nlator reactions [27].\n\nThis section considers the modeling and control prob-\nlems of free-floating space robots and \u2018macro-mini\u2019 struc-\ntures modeled as flexible-base manipulators. Modeling\n\n19 Space Robotics 549\n\n\n\nissues are discussed in the first five subsections, including\nthe underlying kinematic and dynamic equations, the sys-\ntem linear and angular momenta, two modeling approaches\nfor free-floating robots in Sect. 19.2.3, the Reaction Null\nSpace that is useful for disturbance minimization, and\nalternative dynamics formulations regarding ignorable\ncoordinates, contact dynamics and extension to multi-arm\nrobots, in Sect. 19.2.5. The last five subsections are devoted\nto basic control methods: end-link trajectory tracking con-\ntrol, point-to-point motion and non-holonomic path plan-\nning for free-floating robots, vibration suppression control\nfor flexible-base robots, end-link impacts and impedance\ncontrol, and post-impact control for momentum redistribu-\ntion with regard to free-floating robots.\n\n19.2.1 Kinematic and Dynamic Equations\n\nAssume that the orbital robot is made of rigid-body links\nconnected via n single-DOF joints. The joint coordinates\nwill be denoted by h 2 <n. The system can then be\ndescribed with 6\u00fe n generalized coordinates q \u00bc X ; h\u00f0 \u00de,\nwhere X 2 SE 3\u00f0 \u00de denotes the position/orientation of the\nsatellite base w.r.t. an appropriately chosen inertial coor-\ndinate frame (usually assumed to be orbit-fixed).\n\nFirst, the equation of motion for a free-flying space robot\ncomprising a serial-link manipulator arm mounted on a\nsatellite base is introduced (cf. Fig. 19.9). The equation is\nconveniently represented in the following block-matrix\nform\n\nMb Mbm\nMTbm Mm\n\n? ?\n_Vb\n\u20ach\n\n? ?\n\u00fe Cb\n\ncm\n\n? ?\n\u00bc F b\n\ns\n\n? ?\n\u00fe\n\nbTTe\nJTm\n\n? ?\nF e\n\n\u00f019:1\u00de\n\nwhere\n\nMm 2 <n?n : fixed-base manipulator link inertia matrix\nMb 2 <6?6 : system articulated body inertia matrix\nMbm 2 <6?n : coupling inertia matrix\ncm 2 <n : fixed-base manipulator link Coriolis and\n\ncentrifugal forces\n\nCb 2 <6 : Coriolis and centrifugal forces on the system\narticulated body\n\ns 2 <n : manipulator joint torque vector\nVb 2 <6 : spatial velocity of the base\nF b; F e 2 <6 : spatial forces on the base and the end-link,\n\nrespectively\nbTe 2 <6?6 : spatial coordinate transform\nJm 2 <6?n : fixed-base manipulator Jacobian matrix\n\nThe lower-case bold characters denote vectors; the\nupper-case bold characters represent matrices; and the\nspatial quantities such as the rigid body spatial velocity and\nspatial forces are denoted by calligraphic symbols, e.g.\nVO;FO 2 <6; respectively. The convention for spatial\nvectors composed of 3D quantities is as follows: a linear\n\ncomponent followed by an angular component, e.g. VO \u00bc\n\nvTO x\nT\n\nffi ?T\nand FO \u00bc f\n\nT\nnTO\n\nh iT\nwhere v; x; f; n\n\ndenote 3D vectors of body velocity, angular velocity, force\nand moment, respectively. Spatial transforms are repre-\nsented as\n\nkTl \u00bc\nkRl ?kRlkR?l\n0 kRl\n\n? ?\n\u00f019:2\u00de\n\nwith kRl 2 <3?3 denoting the orientation of coordinate\nframe flg with respect to fkg and kR?l 2 <3?3 denoting the\nskew-symmetric operator associated with the vector krl 2\n<3 that expresses the position of flg with respect to fkg.\n\nThe upper part of the above equation denotes the system\narticulated-body dynamics. The coordinates are those of the\nsatellite base, but the inertial properties are those of the\nentire system, hence the term \u2018articulated body\u2019 [28]. The\nlower part of the above equation describes the dynamics of\nthe manipulator. Because base coordinates were used, the\nquantities Mm, cm and Jm are those of the respective fixed-\nbase manipulator. Furthermore, the entire equation includes\ncomponents for the intercoupled inertial and nonlinear\ngeneralized forces on the left-hand side, and the external\nand/or driving forces on the right-hand side.\n\nFig. 19.9 Model of free-floating orbital space robot\n\n550 K.

The first\ncomponent on the right-hand side represents the base\nmotion, and the second component represents the manipu-\nlator motion with respect to the base.\n\n19.2.2 Linear and Angular Momenta\n\nThe spatial momentum of a free-floating robot consists of\ntwo elements: a linear and an angular one. The angular\nmomentum component is written with respect to the center\nof mass (CoM) of the articulated body\n\nLc ?\np\nlc\n\n? ?\n\u00bcMcVc: \u00f019:5\u00de\n\nThe linear element is p \u00bc\nPn\n\ni\u00bc0 mi _ri \u00bc mt _rc and the\nangular element is lc \u00bc\n\nPn\ni\u00bc0 Iixi \u00fe miri ? _ri\u00f0 \u00de where\n\nI i; mi; r i; x i, represent the link i inertia matrix, mass,\nCoM position and angular velocity, respectively: all of which\nare in inertial coordinates. In addition, mt denotes the mass of\nthe articulated body system, and rc and Vc denote its CoM\n\nposition and spatial velocity, respectively. The matrix Mc is a\nblock-diagonal matrix including mtU and Ic ?\n\nPn\ni\u00bc0 Ii\u00f0\n\n?miR?ciR?ci\u00de as upper and lower blocks, respectively.\nRedefining spatial momentum with respect to the base\n\ngives\n\nLb \u00bc\np\n\nrbc ? p\u00fe lc\n\n? ?\n\u00f019:6\u00de\n\nwhere rbc denotes the position of the articulated body CoM\nwith respect to the base frame and yields the advantage of\nthe application of familiar fixed-base manipulator inertial\nproperties. This representation can be related to the equa-\ntion of motion Eq. 19.1, as follows. Extracting the section\nfrom Eq. 19.1 that concerns the system articulated-body\ndynamics yields the following\n\nMb _Vb \u00feMbm\u20ach\u00fe Cb \u00bc F qs \u00f019:7\u00de\n\nwhere F qs \u00bc F b \u00fe TTebF e denotes the quasistatic forces.\nThe dynamic equilibrium of the articulated-body system\ncan be then expressed as F d ? F qs \u00bc 0. Then the dynamic\nforce F d can be obtained as the time derivative F d \u00bc ddtLb.\nIn the absence of quasistatic forces, i.e. when F qs \u00bc 0 and\nwhen the base is unactuated and no external forces act on\nthe end-link, the articulated-body dynamics Eq. 19.7 can be\nintegrated\n\nMbVb \u00feMbm _h \u00bc ?Lb \u00f019:8\u00de\n\nwhere ?Lb is the integration constant. The first component on\nthe left-hand side, MbVb, is the articulated-body momentum\ndue to the base motion. The second component, Mbm _h, is\ndue to the manipulator motion. It plays an important role in\npath planning and control as will be shown below. The\ncomponent is called coupling momentum [29] and will be\ndenoted as Lbm. It gives rise to a spatial force imposed on\nthe base via manipulator motion\n\nF bm ?Mbm\u20ach \u00fe _Mbm _h: \u00f019:9\u00de\n\nF bm will be henceforth referred to as the imposed force.\nThen, the articulated-body dynamics of a free-flying space\nrobot in a form familiar from Newtonian mechanics can be\nrepresented as\n\nMb _Vb \u00bc ?F bm \u00f019:10\u00de\n\nwhich was obtained from Eq. 19.1 under the assumption of no\n\nexternal forces, and the approximation of Cb ? _Mbm _h [29].\nLooking further for integrability of the momentum\n\nequation, the linear part is integrable, whereas the angular\npart is not. Hence, the latter represents a non-holonomic\nconstraint, implying the orientation of the base cannot be\n\nFig. 19.10 Model of flexible-base manipulator system\n\n19 Space Robotics 551\n\n\n\nexpressed as a function of the current manipulator joint\nangles; rather, it will depend on the history of the joint angle\nvector.\n\nThe articulated-body dynamics of a flexible-base robot\nhave the same form as in Eq. 19.7, with the addition of\nquasistatic forces\n\nF qs \u00bc TTebF e ? DbVb ?KbDX b: \u00f019:11\u00de\n\nEven with no external force (F e \u00bc 0), the quasistatic\nforces will be non-zero, e.g. when the base is displaced from\nthe equilibrium position because of the manipulator reac-\ntion. Hence, momentum conservation does not necessarily\nhold in this case. The articulated-body dynamics can be\nrewritten in the classical mass-damper-spring form via the\nabove imposed force notation\n\nMb _Vb \u00fe DbVb \u00feKbDXb \u00bc ?F bm: \u00f019:12\u00de\n\n19.2.3 Virtual Manipulator and Generalized\nJacobian\n\nA free-flying robot with an unactuated base obeys the law of\nmomentum conservation. This is a special case: the\ndynamics are simplified, and additionally, velocity-based\nrelations play a predominant role. However, inertial prop-\nerties are involved in these relations, which is in contrast\nwith the case of fixed-base terrestrial robots. Because the\nbase is unactuated, it moves in reaction to manipulator\nmotions. This results in a diminishment of the motion\nability of the end-link and the workspace of the manipulator\nwhen compared to the same manipulator mounted on a fixed\nbase.\n\nThere are two convenient concepts for dealing with such\nvelocity-level models: the Virtual Manipulator [30] and the\nGeneralized Jacobian [31]. The Virtual Manipulator has a\nmassless kinematic chain fixed at the \u2018virtual ground\u2019\u2014a\npoint that does not move (under zero initial momentum) in\ninertial space. This point is the CoM of the articulated body\nsystem. Furthermore, the link lengths of the Virtual\nManipulator depend on the inertial properties, if the joint\narrangement matches that of the real manipulator, and if the\njoint axes are parallel to the respective axes of the real\nmanipulator. With this construction, the degraded end-link\nmotion ability due to the base motion can be accounted for.\n\nAnother convenient notation for velocity-level relations\nis the Generalized Jacobian. Spatial momentum conserva-\ntion, as in Eq. 19.8, can be used as a constraint with respect\nto the manipulator motion. From Eq. 19.8, the base velocity\nis obtained as\n\nVb \u00bc ?Vb ?M?1b Mbm _h \u00f019:13\u00de\n\nwhere ?Vb \u00bcM?1b ?Lb is acquired from the initial spatial\nmomentum and the second component is attributed to the\ncoupling momentum induced by the manipulator motion.\nInserting Vb into Eq. 19.4, the constrained manipulator end-\neffector velocity is\n\nVe \u00bc ?Ve \u00fe J? _h \u00f019:14\u00de\n\nwhere ?Ve \u00bc Teb ?Vb. The matrix\n\nJ? ? Jm ? TebM?1b Mbm\n\nis called the Generalized Jacobian.\n\n19.2.4 The Reaction Null Space\n\nAs shown previously, the motion of the base in reaction to\nmanipulator motion diminishes the end-link motion ability\nand the effective workspace. One possibility to mitigate this\nis to use custom path planning and control methods for\nmanipulator motions that would minimize the reaction at\nthe base. In fact, it is straightforward to predict the existence\nof reactionless motion. In other words, there are manipu-\nlator motions that will guarantee full dynamical decoupling\nbetween the base and the manipulator. This condition is\nexpressed simply as F bm \u00bc 0:\n\nWhen the system articulated-body dynamics Eq. 19.7 of\nan orbital space robot with an unactuated base, zero initial\nbase velocity (?Vb \u00bc 0), and zero external forces (F qs \u00bc 0)\nis considered with Eqs. 19.10 or 19.12, the following rela-\ntion results\n\nF bm \u00bcMbm\u20ach\u00fe _Mbm _h \u00bc 0 \u00f019:15\u00de\n\nwhere the nonlinear force Cb in (19.7) was approximated as\nit was in Eq. 19.10. This equation can be integrated once to\nobtain the momentum equation\n\nMbm _h \u00bc ?Lbm \u00f019:16\u00de\n\nwhere Lbm denotes the coupling momentum. This is a linear\nequation for the velocities and its solution type depends on\nthe number of manipulator joints n. The equation will be\ndetermined if n \u00bc 6, and under-determined otherwise\n(n [ 6). In the latter case, the joint velocity vector derived\nfrom the above equation is\n\n_h \u00bcM\u00febm ?Lbm \u00fe PMbm _ha \u00f019:17\u00de\n\nwhere \u00f0?\u00de\u00fe is the Moore\u2013Penrose generalized inverse, P\u00f0?\u00de\nis a null-space projector and \u00f0?\u00dea is an arbitrary vector [29].\nThe two components on the r.h.s. are orthogonal, implying\nthat any joint velocity from the null space of the coupling\ninertia matrix will not change the momentum of the base.\n\n552 K. Yoshida et al.\n\n\n\nThese types of manipulator motions are termed reactionless\n\nand are obtained by varying the arbitrary velocity vector _ha.\nThe null space itself is termed the Reaction Null Space\n(RNS) [29] and is useful for motion analysis, path planning\nand reactionless motion control.\n\nThe set of reactionless motions depends on the rank of\nthe RNS projector: rankPMbm \u00bc n? 6. With a seven-DOF\nmanipulator, e.g., the set will be just one-dimensional,\nimplying that reactionless motions are possible only along\nthe integral curves of the above differential equation. In\ngeneral, it is desirable to have a larger set of such paths.\nOne possibility to achieve this is to increase the number of\nmanipulator joints (i.e. the DOFs). Another option is to\nredefine the RNS with respect to some of the base coordi-\nnates. From a practical viewpoint, the orientation of the\nbase is the most important factor, hence, the RNS can be\nredefined only with respect to the angular variables. For that\ncase, the rank of the RNS projector will increase to n? 3.\nAn example is shown in Sect. 19.2.10.\n\n19.2.5 Other Representations of System\nDynamics\n\n19.2.5.1 Ignorable Coordinates\nFrom analytical mechanics it is known that conserved\nquantities in the equation of motion yield ignorable or\ncyclic coordinates. In the case of free-floating robot\ndynamics, such are the coordinates of the base. This prop-\nerty was already used when deriving the Generalized\nJacobian in Eq. 19.14 from the kinematic and momentum\nequations. The ignorable coordinates can also be removed\nin a similar way from the dynamic equation Eq. 19.1. This\nleads to a representation in a reduced form\n\nM?m\u20ach\u00fe c? \u00bc s? \u00fe J?\nTF e \u00f019:18\u00de\n\nwhere M?m \u00bcMm ?MTbmM?1b Mbm, c?m \u00bc cm ?MTbmM?1b Cb\nand s? \u00bc s?MTbmM?1b F b [32]. The dimension of the equa-\ntion is decreased to n and is the same as for a fixed-base\nmanipulator.\n\nFurthermore, system dynamics can be represented in\nterms of quasi-coordinates by using the articulated-body\nquasi-coordinates Vc instead of the base coordinates X b.\nThe articulated-body dynamics are derived via time differ-\nentiation of spatial momentum in Eq. 19.5\n\nMc _Vc \u00fe Cc \u00bc TTecF e \u00f019:19\u00de\n\nwhere Cc denotes the non-linear forces. Combing with the\nreduced dynamics in Eq. 19.18, the total dynamics in a\ndecoupled form is as follows\n\nMc 0\n0 M?m\n\n? ?\n_Vc\n\u20ach\n\n? ?\n\u00fe Cc\n\nc?m\n\n? ?\n\u00bc 0\n\ns?\n\n? ?\n\u00fe T\n\nT\nec\n\nJ?T\n\n? ?\nF e:\n\n\u00f019:20\u00de\n\n19.2.5.2 End-Link Contact Dynamics\nDuring manipulation and other tasks, the end-link may\nestablish contact with an object. Spatial contact forces will\nthereby be generated and subsequently propagated via the\nend-link to the rest of the robot links. Hence, it is crucial to\nmodel the end-link contact dynamics.\n\nThe spatial velocity of the end-link is represented in\nSect. 19.4, which uses base coordinates as an intermittent\nframe. Because these are ignorable coordinates, the relation\ncan be rewritten via the articulated-body quasi-coordinates\nas\n\nVe \u00bc TecVc \u00fe J? _h: \u00f019:21\u00de\n\nTo obtain the dynamic relations, the respective acceleration\nwill be used\n\n_Ve \u00bc Tec _Vc \u00fe J?\u20ach\u00fe _TecVc \u00fe J?\n:\n\n_h: \u00f019:22\u00de\n\nThe quasi-coordinate acceleration _Vc and the joint accel-\neration \u20ach can be obtained from the articulated-body\ndynamics in Eq. 19.19 and from the reduced form of\ndynamics in Eq. 19.18, respectively. In contact scenarios,\ntwo cases are usually considered: free manipulator joints\n\n(s \u00bc 0) and locked manipulator joints ( _h \u00bc 0) [33]. The\nend-link contact dynamics can then be represented as\n\n_Ve \u00bcM?1? F e \u00feA? \u00f019:23\u00de\n\nwhere A? denotes non-linear velocity-dependent end-link\nacceleration and\n\nM?1? \u00bc TecM?1c TTec \u00fe jJ?M?\n?1\nm J?\n\nT \u00f019:24\u00de\n\nrepresents the mobility tensor s.t. j \u00bc 1 in the free-joint\ncase, and j \u00bc 0 in the locked-joint case.\n\n19.2.5.3 Extension to Multi-Arm Orbital Robots\nWhen a free-flying space robot has l manipulator arms\nmounted on a base, the manipulators comprise a tree-like\nstructure. Each manipulator arm has nk joints,\nk \u00bc 1; 2; . . .; l, resulting in the total number of joints of\nn \u00bc\n\nPl\nk\u00bc1 nk. External forces may act on the base as well as\n\non one or more of the end-links. The dynamic equation\nEq. 19.1 then becomes\n\nMb Mbm\nMTbm Mm\n\n? ?\n_Vb\n\u20ach\n\n? ?\n\u00fe Cb\n\ncm\n\n? ?\n\u00bc F b\n\ns\n\n? ?\n\u00fe T\n\nT\neb\n\nJTm\n\n? ?\nF e \u00f019:25\u00de\n\n19 Space Robotics 553\n\n\n\nwhere h \u00bc hT1 h\nT\n2 . . .h\n\nT\nl\n\nffi ?T\n; s \u00bc sT1 sT2 . . .sTl\n\nffi ?T2 <n, F e \u00bc\nF Te1F\n\nT\ne2\n\n. . .F Tel\nh iT\n\n2 <6l, the Jacobian Jm 2 <6l?n is a block-\ndiagonal with blocks Jmk 2 <6?nk and is the fixed-base\nmanipulator Jacobian of the k-th arm, F ek is the spatial\nforce acting at its end-link, and TTeb 2 <6?6l is composed of\nmatrices TTekb [34\u201337].\n\nThe kinematic equations, on the other hand, can be\nwritten as\n\nVek \u00bc ?Vek \u00fe J?k _hk; k \u00bc 1; 2; . . .; l \u00f019:26\u00de\n\nwhere Vek is the spatial velocity of the k-th end-link, ?Vek \u00bc\nTekb ?Vb is a result of the initial spatial momentum and the\nmatrices J?k ? J?mk ? TekbM?1b Mbmk are the Generalized\nJacobians [34].\n\nThe dynamic equation Eq. 19.3 can be recast in a similar\nfashion when the flexible-base space robot includes more\nthan one manipulator.\n\n19.2.6 Velocity-Based End-Link Trajectory\nTracking Control\n\nVelocity-based control is used in teleoperation mode, as\nexplained in Sect. 19.1. However, velocity-based end-link\ntrajectory tracking is used in an autonomous mode of\noperation to accomplish precise motion tasks such as\napproaching specific parts of hardware equipment. The end-\nlink path is planned in order, for example, to avoid unde-\nsirable interference with other parts of the equipment.\nTypically, feedback control would be employed in work-\nspace coordinates based on the manipulator\u2019s inverse\nJacobian [38]. Orbital robots can be directly controlled with\nsuch methods when the end-link trajectory is designed with\nrespect to the base coordinate frame. For trajectories spec-\nified in inertial (orbit-fixed) coordinates (e.g. during satellite\ncapturing, satellite repair or payload transfer), the base\ndeflection due to reactions should be taken into account. For\nthe case of an unactuated base, the feedback controller can\nbe designed using the Generalized Jacobian formulation\nfrom the previous section [31]. The manipulator joint\nvelocities to be used as control inputs for the velocity-level\nfeedback controller are\n\n_h \u00bc J??1 Kp X de ? X e\n? ?\n\n\u00fe Vde\n? ?\n\n\u00f019:27\u00de\n\nwhere Xde and Vde denote the desired end-link spatial posi-\ntion and velocity along the given inertial trajectory and Kp\nis a feedback gain matrix. The actual end-link position X e is\nobtained by summing up two components: the inertial base\nposition, obtained via appropriate measurements, and the\nend-link position w.r.t. the base, obtained via the direct\nkinematics relations for fixed-base robots based on manip-\nulator joint position measurements [38].\n\n19.2.7 Point-to-Point Motion\nand Nonholonomic Path Planning\n\nPoint-to-point (PTP) motion control is a method of\nmanipulator motion control that ensures precise positioning\nof the end-link at a desired spatial position in inertial space\nor attaining a desired manipulator configuration. In this\ncase, the motion trajectory is of little interest [38]. The\nfolding and unfolding of the manipulator arm to/from the\nstowed position is usually carried out via PTP motion\ncontrol in joint space coordinates. Alternatively, tasks that\nrequire end-link positioning with respect to some equipment\ncan be done either in base coordinates, in which the\nequipment is fixed to the base, or in inertial coordinates, in\nwhich the equipment is fixed to another body. In the latter\ncase, PTP motion control can be realized via the General-\nized Jacobian feedback control equation\n\n_h \u00bc J??1 Kp X de ? X e\n? ?\n\n?Kd _X e\n? ?\n\n: \u00f019:28\u00de\n\nThe base may thereby freely change its state.\nEspecially, in the case of a free-flying robot with an\n\nunactuated base, the system exhibits non-holonomic\nbehavior owing to the nonintegrability condition on the\nspacecraft attitude. Nevertheless, it is possible to control the\nbase attitude during PTP operations, e.g. via a bidirectional\npath planning method [39, 40].\n\n19.2.8 Vibration Suppression Control\n\nFor flexible-base space robots, the vibrations of the base\nmay lead to end-link task performance deterioration. It is\npossible to suppress the vibrations of the base via manip-\nulator motion, using the inertial coupling between the base\nand the manipulator [25]. This becomes apparent when\nanalyzing the articulated-body dynamics expressed from\nEqs. 19.7 and 19.11 as\n\nMb _Vb \u00feMbm\u20ach\u00fe Cb \u00bc TTebF e ? DbVb ?KbDX b:\n\u00f019:29\u00de\n\nAdditional damping can be injected into the above\ndynamics via a control joint acceleration [29]\n\n\u20ach \u00bcM\u00febm DbcVb ? Cb\u00f0 \u00de \u00f019:30\u00de\n\nwhere Dbc denotes a matrix for additional damping. This\nconfirms that in the absence of external forces (F e \u00bc 0), the\nfollowing closed-loop dynamics are obtained\n\nMb _Vb \u00fe Dbc \u00fe Db\u00f0 \u00deVb \u00feKbDX b \u00bc 0: \u00f019:31\u00de\n\n554 K. Yoshida et al.\n\n\n\n19.2.9 End-Link Impacts and Impedance\nControl\n\nA task of utmost importance for orbital space robots is the\nretrieval of floating bodies, e.g. malfunctioned satellites or\nspace debris. Because it is usually assumed that the target\nobject lacks any dedicated grapple fixture, special care is\nneeded when establishing the initial contact and selecting\nthe post-contact tracking control method for the robot arm\nso that the target is not pushed away during the operation.\n\nThe inertial properties during the initial impact depend\non the end-link contact dynamics, as described in Sect.\n19.2.5. The end-link approach direction specified via a unit\nvector n is assumed to be known. Therefore, the inertial\nproperties can be described in terms of a scalar: the effective\nmass m? with an impact along n. This mass can be obtained\nfrom the mobility tensor M?1? in Eq. 19.24 as follows\n\nm? \u00bc\nkfek\nnT _ve\n\n\u00bc 1\nnT M?1ff n\n\n\u00f019:32\u00de\n\nwhere fe and _ve denote the linear parts of the spatial end-\nlink force and acceleration, respectively, and M?1ff is the\n\nupper-left 3? 3 block sub-matrix of the mobility tensor.\nBecause the tensor is manipulator configuration dependent\nfor a given approach direction n, the effective mass can be\nvaried by changing the configuration at impact.\n\nHowever, the effective mass variation via manipulator\nconfiguration is limited [41]. A broader range can be\nachieved with the help of mechanical-impedance control: a\nmethod suggested in [42] for fixed-base manipulator end-\nlink control during contact tasks. The end-link dynamics are\nspecified thereby via the equation\n\nMe _Ve \u00fe DeVe \u00feKeDX e \u00bc F e \u00f019:33\u00de\n\nwhere Me, De and Ke are desired mechanical-impedance\nrelated spatial transforms for inertia, damping and stiffness,\nrespectively. These quantities determine the end-link\nbehavior during contact. To ensure the above end-link\ndynamics, the following joint control torque is applied\n\ns? \u00bc M?mJ??1M?1e ? J?T\n? ?\n\nF e \u00fe c?\n\n?

Unfortunately, the equation is quite complex.\nAdditionally, a high control bandwidth would be required to\nrealize the desired end-link behavior [41].\n\nA formulation for impedance control of multi-arm free-\nfloating robots can be found in [43].\n\n19.2.10 Post-Impact Control for Momentum\nRedistribution\n\nThe momentum transferred to the articulated body after the\nimpact with the target may lead to a significant base\ntranslation or rotation. Rotation can be especially harmful\nand is highly undesirable. It is possible to employ the\nmanipulator arm to accommodate a portion of the\nmomentum transferred to the space robot via the impact,\nthus minimizing the initial post-impact base momentum\n[44]. The accommodated momentum can then be trans-\nferred to the base and mitigated thereafter with the assis-\ntance of a reaction or momentum wheel control subsystem.\nThis requires proper post-impact momentum redistribution\ncontrol: the underlying equations are derived as follows.\nFocusing on the base rotation, the system dynamics are to\nbe rewritten using only base angular velocity quasi-coor-\ndinates. First, the translational coordinates of the base are\neliminated from the momentum equation. The angular\nmomentum with respect to the base\u2019s CoM can be written as\n\nlb \u00bc ~Mx x \u00fe ~Mxm _h\u00fe ~Mx/ _/ \u00f019:35\u00de\n\nwhere ~Mx \u00bcMx \u00fe mtR?bcR?bc and ~Mxm \u00bcMxm \u00fe R?bcMvm.\nThese block matrices are derived from the articulated-body\nsystem and the coupling inertia matrices\n\nMb \u00bc\nMv Mvx\nMTvx Mx\n\n? ?\nand Mbm \u00bc MTvm MTxm\n\nffi ?T\n, respec-\n\ntively. Detailed expressions for the sub-matrices can be\n\nfound in [32]. ~Mx/ /\n:\n\nrepresents the angular momentum\n\ncomponent due to the momentum wheels, and /\n:\n\ndenotes the\nrespective quasi-coordinates. The tilde operator modifies\nthe respective matrix in such a way that linear motion of the\nbase is implicitly accounted for.\n\nAngular momentum is conserved during the post-impact\nphase. Hence, the manipulator control joint rates can be\nderived as\n\n_h \u00bc ~M\u00fexm ?lb ? ~Mxxd ? ~Mx/ _/\n? \t\n\n\u00fe P ~Mxm _h\nd\na \u00f019:36\u00de\n\nwhere ?lb denotes the conserved angular momentum. The\n\narticulated-body momentum component ~Mxxd and the\n\nRNS component P ~Mxm\n_hda can be used to minimize the base\n\nrotation and the joint motion, respectively, using damping\n\ncontrols xd \u00bc ?Kxx and _hda \u00bc ?Kh _h, respectively, where\nKx and Kh are damping gain matrices [44]. Other control\ndesigns are also possible, see e.g. [45].\n\n19 Space Robotics 555\n\n\n\n19.3 Modeling and Control of Planetary\nRobots\n\nPlanetary exploration programs have been pursuing exten-\nsive scientific missions dedicated to understanding the\ngeological and climatological characteristics of planetary\nbodies, as well as seeking microorganisms of extraterrestrial\nlife. A robotic probe deployed on a target body plays an\nimportant role in achieving scientific missions, in particular,\na probe having surface mobility (rover) can get close to a\nspecific point of interest and thoroughly enrich the scientific\nreturn of the mission.\n\nA fundamental requirement for a rover is the capability\nof traversing the rough terrain of a planetary body. It also\nneeds to endure a harsh environment: extremely high/low\ntemperatures and/or strong cosmic radiation. A power\nmanagement scheme for the rover differs from that used for\nan orbiting (or interplanetary) spacecraft. This is because\nthe power spent by the mobility system significantly varies\naccording to the terrain conditions (sandy, rocky, or sloped\nterrain) in which the rover travels. The power generated by\nthe solar array panels depends on the solar elevation angle\n(varied by the local time and latitude of the rover\u2019s location)\nand the orbital longitude of the planetary body.3 The rover\nshould also employ autonomous/semi-autonomous guid-\nance, navigation, and control (GN&C) to travel to a des-\nignated location. These technical issues for each subsystem\nof the planetary rover are summarized in Table 19.1.\n\nFrom a robotics point of view, this section primarily\nfocuses on the research and development of robotic\nmobility and GN&C subsystems, and introduces actual\napplications/implementations of this technology. General\ndescriptions for the other subsystems, including the power,\ntelecommunications, and environmental durability, are\npresented in other chapters.4\n\nThe surface mobility system of the rover is indispensable\nfor traversing rough and deformable terrain. Therefore,\nvehicle/terrain interaction is fundamental mechanics for the\nfollowing aspects\n\u2022 Design\u2014suspension configuration, vehicle dimensions,\n\nand actuator specifications.\n\u2022 Mobility evaluation\u2014slope traversability, obstacle\n\ncrossing, and power required for the mobility.\n\u2022 Navigation and control\u2014localization, path planning, and\n\ntraction control.\n\nThe surface terrain of the Moon or a planet such as Mars\nis covered with fine-grained soil (regolith), boulders, rocks,\nor stones. Because of such challenging terrain, the rover\nshould be aware of mobility hazards such as rolling over a\nsloped surface, immobilizing wheel slips on loose sand, and\ncolliding with obstacles such as rocks. In particular, the\nMars Exploration Rovers (MER), Spirit and Opportunity,\nhave proven that wheel slip is a critical hindrance to their\nexploration missions. The issues related to resolving rover\nmobility requires well-defined mechanics for wheel-terrain\ninteraction and an analytical approach for evaluating rover\nmobility performance.\n\nThe discussion of rover mobility in this section is divided\ninto two issues: the kinematics/dynamics, and the wheel-\nterrain interaction mechanics. Section 19.3.1 presents the\nkinematics and dynamics of a planetary rover that can be\nused for evaluating mobility performance in rough terrain.\nThe wheel-terrain interaction is addressed in Sect. 19.3.2\nwith a brief review for wheel-terrain interaction research\nand an introduction to a terramechanics-based analytical\nmodel.\n\nThe latency in communication owing to the long dis-\ntance between Earth and a target planet renders the real-\ntime direct teleoperation of a rover infeasible. An operator\ncannot immediately maneuver the rover when it encounters\nan obstacle or other contingencies. In addition, the rover\ncannot obtain prior knowledge of the physical characteris-\ntics of an environment. Thus, it needs to consider the\nenvironment as it encounters it and make decisions by itself.\nThe GN&C subsystem is designed for these tasks as the\nautonomous brain of the rover. Section 19.3.3 describes\nresearch related to the GN&C, including the sensory system\nfor terrain mapping, localization technique, and path\nplanning.\n\n19.3.1 Kinematics and Dynamics of Mobile\nRobots\n\nThe kinematics and dynamics of a planetary rover are the\nprimary considerations for the mobility analysis of the\nrover. Whereas there has been work to perfects the kine-\nmatics for indoor mobile robots on smooth, flat surface [46\u2013\n48], the challenge of mobility analysis for a rover is\naccounting for a rough terrain profile. The motion of the\nrover becomes relatively complicated because of the\ndynamic interaction of the wheel on deformable terrain (i.e.,\nwheel slips). The kinematic modeling of a mobile robot on\nrough terrain has been reported [49\u201351].\n\nThere has also been extensive research regarding the\ndynamics of planetary rovers: a rover simulator called\nROAMS used for the NASA Mars rovers [52], a dynamic\n\n3 Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) can solve these\nlimitations for the solar array panels.\n4 Electrical power is described in Chap. 10, thermal systems in Chap.\n13, and telecommunications in Chap. 14.\n\n556 K.

A dynamic model for the\nrover is also described.\n\n19.3.1.1 Kinematic Analysis\nThe kinematics of the rover are basically used for naviga-\ntion and motion control to achieve appropriate maneuvers\non rough terrain. Kinematics also play a significant role in\nthe design perspective: a kinematic model may be used to\nevaluate joint configuration, link length (between joints),\nand wheelbase or tread dimensions. In this subsection, an\ninverse kinematic problem is introduced that can be used to\nevaluate the kinematic validity and static stability of the\nrover on rough terrain. Here, a six wheeled rover with a\nrocker-bogie suspension [56] is assumed for the kinematic\nanalysis. This configuration was used to evaluate the\nSojourner, MER (Spirit and Opportunity), and Curiosity\nrovers [57, 58]. In addition, this subsection also addresses a\nkinematic constraint model for a four-wheeled rover expe-\nriencing wheel/vehicle slips. This model can be used for a\nderivation of the steering maneuver to achieve the desired\nmotion control.\n\nAs seen in Fig. 19.11, assuming rover position pc and\nheading W with respect to a terrain given as a height map\nz\u00f0x; y\u00de, the kinematic loop closure equations can be written\nas follows [59]\n\nzrr \u00bc zlr \u00fe l1 cos H\u00f0sin h1r ? sin h1l\u00de \u00fe w sin H\nzrr \u00bc zlm \u00fe cos H\u00f0l1 sin h1r ? l2 sin h1l ? l3 sin h2l\u00de \u00fe w sin H\nzrr \u00bc zlf \u00fe cos H\u00f0l1 sin h1r ? l2 sin h1l ? l4 sin h2l\u00de \u00fe w sin H\nzrr \u00bc zrm \u00fe cos H\u00f0l1 sin h1r ? l2 sin h1l ? l3 sin h2r\u00de\nzrr \u00bc zrf \u00fe cos H\u00f0l1 sin h1r ? l2 sin h1l ? l4 sin h2r\u00de\n\n\u00f019:37\u00de\n\nwhere zij\u00f0i \u00bc fr; lg; j \u00bc fr;m; fg\u00de refers to the z component\nof pij, with index i referring to the right and left side, and\nindex j referring to the rear, middle, and front wheels.\n\nInputs for this equation are a terrain elevation map, the\nposition pc of the rover center, and the rover heading. These\ninputs mitigate the number of unknown parameters that can\nbe determined by solving the equation. The solution for the\ninverse kinematic problem with multiple contact points on\nthe terrain is subject to the simultaneous cross-solution of\nmultiple nonlinear equations. Newton\u2019s method can be\napplied to solve such equations.\n\nThe kinematics of the rover is also used for motion\ncontrol of the rover, such as the steering maneuvers needed\nto follow a specified traveling path. As mentioned in Sect.\n19.3.1, wheel/vehicle slips are a critical issue for the rover;\ntherefore, the kinematic model for motion control should\ninclude such effects. The rest of this subsection describes\nthe kinematic model with wheel/vehicle slips [60].\n\nA 2D kinematic model of a four-wheeled vehicle, which\nincludes the slip angle of the vehicle b0 and lateral wheel\nslippage bi is shown in Fig. 19.12. In this model, each wheel\nhas a steering angle di, where the subscript i denotes the\nwheel ID (i \u00bc 1; . . .; 4, in this case).

The dimension of\nthe rover is defined by lf , lr, dR, and dL. For this model, the\nfollowing assumptions are considered: (1) the distance\nbetween wheels is constant, (2) the steering axle of each\nwheel is perpendicular to the terrain surface, and (3) the\nvehicle does not consist of any flexible parts.\n\nThe non-holonomic constraints with the lateral slips of\nthe wheel and vehicle are defined by the following equations\n\n_x0 sin /0 ? _y0 cos /0 \u00bc 0\n_xi sin /i ? _yi cos /i \u00bc 0\n\n\u00f019:38\u00de\n\nwhere /0 \u00bc h0 \u00fe b0, and /i \u00bc h0 \u00fe di \u00fe bi.

Despite the slow\ntraveling velocity of a rover,5 the motion often behaves\ndynamically because of rough terrain such as bumpy,\nsloped, or rocky surfaces. A schematic illustration of the\ndynamic model of a six-wheeled rover having a rocker-\nbogie suspension is shown in Fig. 19.13. The dynamics of\nthe rover are modeled as an articulated multibody system as\nfollows [63]\n\nH\n_Vb\n\u20acq\n\n? ?\n\u00fe C\u00feG \u00bc Fb\n\ns\n\n? ?\n\u00fe JTF e \u00f019:43\u00de\n\nwhere H represents the inertia matrix of each body, C is the\nvelocity depending term, G is the gravity term, Vb are the\ntranslational and angular velocities of the vehicle, q is the\nangle of each joint (such as wheel rotation and steering\nangle), Fb are the forces and moments at the centroid of the\nvehicle body, s are the torques acting at each joint (driving/\nsteering torques), J is the Jacobian matrix, and F e consists\nof the external forces and moments acting at the centroid of\neach wheel, namely fij\u00f0i \u00bc fr; lg; j \u00bc fr;m; fg\u00de. The exter-\nnal (contact) forces and torques on each wheel can be cal-\nculated based on a wheel-terrain contact model, as\ndescribed in the next section.

The Mars\nScience Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity was designed to travel up to\napproximately 200 m per day [64].\n\n558 K. Yoshida et al.\n\n\n\n19.3.2 Wheel-Terrain Interaction Mechanics\n\nThe study of the mechanical properties of the terrain and the\nterrains response to an off-road vehicle has been included in\nthe field of terramechanics,6 in which an analysis of the\ninteraction between wheel/track and soil has been of pri-\nmary focus.\n\nIn classical terramechanics, Bekker, an originator of\nterramechanics, derived a well-known pressure-sinkage\nequation and also formulated the shear stress as a function\nof soil deformation (displacement) [65, 66]. His work\ngreatly contributed to the design and development of the\nLunar Roving Vehicle used on the Apollo 15\u201317 missions\nto the Moon. Wong developed a comprehensive procedure\nfor predicting the performance of both driven and towed\nwheels [67\u201369]. The procedure calculates wheel mechanics\nby applying the stress distribution model beneath the wheel.\n\nTerramechanics can be divided into three methods [70,\n71]: (1) an analytical method, (2) an empirical method, and\n(3) a numerical method.\n\nThe analytical method considers a physical model for\nvehicle-terrain interactions based on a theoretical analysis\nwith experimental results for model validation. The\nempirical method uses a practical measurement of soil\nstrength with a specialized apparatus, such as a cone index\n(CI) [67], which is often used for an in situ prediction of\nvehicle traversability. The numerical method includes the\nfinite-element method and discrete-element method that\nsimulate soil deformation and vehicle-terrain interaction\nbehavior with computer technology [72\u201374].\n\nThe wheel-terrain model can be used for the design of\nrover mobility systems: the terramechanics model can be\nused as a feasible wheel/track design because it is able to\nmaximize the traction performance for off-the-load loco-\nmotion under specific constraints [75, 76]. Additionally, the\n\nmobility performance of the rover (i.e., its traversability on\nsloped or deformable terrain) will be numerically/experi-\nmentally analyzed based on the wheel model [77, 78]. This\nmobility prediction and evaluation technique would be also\nvaluable for the mobility system design [79] in addition to\nan actual rover operation to determine rover maneuvering.\nSome recent works have reported dynamic simulation tools\ncombined with the terramechanics wheel model (e.g.,\nNASA Mars rovers [52, 80] and ExoMars [53, 55].\n\nThis section focuses on the analytical method and\nintroduces a typical interaction model of a rigid wheel on\ndeformable terrain.\n\n19.3.2.1 Terramechanics-Based Wheel-Terrain\nModel: Analytical Method\n\nIn the analytical method, the basic principle of a wheel\ntraction model considers the stress distribution at the wheel-\nterrain contact point, which usually depends on wheel slips.\nAn integral of the stress around the contact point derives\nwheel traction forces, such as drawbar pull, side force, and\nresistance torque.\n\nA contact model for a rigid wheel on deformable terrain\nis schematically shown in Fig. 19.14. A classical terrame-\nchanics model defines the wheel-terrain contact forces,\nincluding the drawbar pull Fx, vertical force Fz, and resis-\ntance torque T , as the following equations [68]\n\nFx \u00bc rb\nZhf\n\nhr\n\nsx\u00f0h\u00de cos h? r\u00f0h\u00de sin hf gdh \u00f019:44\u00de\n\nFz \u00bc rb\nZhf\n\nhr\n\nsx\u00f0h\u00de sin h\u00fe r\u00f0h\u00de cos hf gdh \u00f019:45\u00de\n\nTx \u00bc r2b\nZhf\n\nhr\n\nsx\u00f0h\u00dedh \u00f019:46\u00de\n\nFig. 19.12 Kinematic model of\nfour-wheeled rover with wheel/\nvehicle slips\n\n6 The term terramechanics is coined from \u2018terrain\u2019 and \u2018mechanics\u2019.\nSoil mechanics is the study of the interaction of structures in various\nsoils.\n\n19 Space Robotics 559\n\n\n\nwhere b represents the wheel width, r\u00f0h\u00de is the normal\nstress beneath the wheel, and sx\u00f0h\u00de are the shear stresses in\nthe longitudinal direction of the wheel. The contact point of\nthe wheel is determined by the entry angle hf and the exit\nangle hr.\n\nThe side force (i.e., the force in the lateral direction) of\nthe wheel appears when the wheel steers or traverses sloped\nterrain. The side force Fy can be modeled as the summation\nof two forces generated at the wheel: the force Fu attrib-\nutable to the shearing motion beneath the wheel and the\nforce Fs generated by the bulldozing motion on the side face\nof the wheel [63]\n\nFy \u00bc Fu \u00fe Fs \u00bc\nZhf\n\nhr\n\nrbsy\u00f0h\u00de \u00fe\nZhf\n\nhr\n\nRb r ? z\u00f0h\u00de cos hf gdh\n\n\u00f019:47\u00de\n\nwhere sy\u00f0h\u00de are the shear stresses in the lateral direction of\nthe wheel and Rb is modeled as a reaction resistance gen-\nerated by the bulldozing phenomenon on a side wall of the\nwheel. Rb is a function of the wheel sinkage z.\n\nIn these equations, the normal stress r\u00f0h\u00de and shear\nstresses sx\u00f0h\u00de and sy\u00f0h\u00de are defined by the function of soil\nparameters, wheel contact angle, and wheel dimensions.\nDetails about the stress model can be found in other\nresearch [63, 68, 69, 81, 82].\n\n19.3.2.2 Experimental Validation\nThe previous wheel traction model needs to be validated\nthrough multiple experimental tests with varied state\nparameters such as soil or wheel traveling profiles. A single-\nwheel test bed (Fig. 19.15) is commonly used for model\nvalidation. The test bed primarily consists of a carriage\nsection and wheel section. The carriage velocity is\n\ncontrolled relative to wheel velocity, which realizes wheel\nslip (or traction load), while measuring wheel traction for-\nces, wheel sinkage, and other parameters. Experimental data\nare then compared with the values obtained from the\nnumerical simulation of the wheel traction model.\n\nThe primary focus of the classical terramechanics model\nhas been devoted to the application of large, heavy vehicles\n(i.e., vehicles weighing hundreds/thousands kilograms).\nTherefore, when exploiting the classical model for analyz-\ning lunar/planetary rover test beds (usually small, light-\nweight), several assumptions for the classical model would\nbe omitted7 that may cause an inaccurate calculation of\nwheel traction performance.8,9 Some researchers have\nassumed the errors attributable to the omitted assumptions\nas modeling errors or the uncertainty of parameters used for\nthe calculation. Recently, several approaches to update/\nimprove the classical terramechanics model were success-\nfully applied to relatively lightweight vehicles. For exam-\nple, a direct measurement device for the normal stress\ndistribution has been reported [84]. A wheel-diameter\ndependent pressure-sinkage model has been proposed [85].\nAn improved approach for the calculation of shear defor-\nmation modulus has also been studied [86].\n\nFig. 19.13 Rover dynamics\nmodel\n\n7 One assumption in Bekker\u2019s pressure-sinkage model is that the\ncontact point of the wheel on deformable soil (circumferential section)\nis a series of consecutive flat plates.\n8 Bekker noted this issue: \u2018\u2018Predictions for wheels smaller than\n20 inches in diameter become less accurate as wheel diameter\ndecreases, because the sharp curvature of the loading area was neither\nconsidered in its entirety nor is it reflected in bevameter tests\u2019\u2019 [66].\n9 These assumptions provide an inaccurate prediction for vehicles\nwith wheel diameters less than approximately 50 cm and a normal\nloading of less than approximately 45 N [85].\n\n560 K. Yoshida et al.\n\n\n\n19.3.2.3 Soil Parameter Identification and its\nUncertainty Analysis\n\nThe wheel-terrain interaction model described in the pre-\nvious section assumes that the physical properties of the soil\n\nare known. These properties must be measured in situ by\non-board robotic sensor systems [87], but their values\nwould stochastically vary with location, resulting in tre-\nmendous uncertainties.\n\nFig. 19.14 Wheel-terrain\ncontact model\n\n(a)\n(b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFig. 19.15 Single-wheel test\nbeds for experimental validation\nof terramechanics models.\na Single-wheel test bed at MIT\n[83]. b Single-track test bed at\nJAXA [75]. c Single-wheel test\nbed at DLR [76]. d Single-wheel\ntest bed at Tohoku University\n[63]\n\n19 Space Robotics 561\n\n\n\nSeveral researchers have addressed soil parameter iden-\ntification, for example an online terrain parameter estimator\nthat uses a linear least-squares method to compute the\nvalues of cohesion and internal friction angle with simpli-\nfied classical terramechanics equations [88], and applying\nthe Newton\u2013Raphson method to a modified nonlinear\nwheel-terrain interaction model that can identify unknown\nparameters such as the pressure-sinkage coefficient, internal\nfriction angle, and shear deformation modulus [89].\n\nThe parameters identified by these approaches remain\nsubject to uncertainty. Some recent works have attempted to\npredict rover mobility even under uncertain conditions, for\nexample a learning-based approach for slip prediction that\nis used for a traversability analysis of a rover [90], and an\napplied a statistical method for mobility prediction that\nexplicitly considers terrain uncertainty and achieves a\ncomputationally-efficient prediction of rover dynamics [91].\n\n19.3.3 Guidance, Navigation, and Control\n\nPlanetary rovers need to traverse the surface of a target\nbody with little knowledge of the terrain, such as the\nphysical properties of the soil or the geometrical features of\nthe terrain. Space probes and orbiters around the target body\nmay be able to provide a global terrain map with relatively\ngood accuracy.10 The terrain map available from the orbiter\nis often useful for determining a \u2018global\u2019 destination;\nhowever, it is not feasible to refer to the map in real-time\nwhile the rover travels through intermediate waypoints\ntoward the global destination. Therefore, the rover is\nrequired to perceive the local terrain environment and to\nplan a feasible path to traverse rough terrain. This section\nintroduces the research and development dedicated to ter-\nrain mapping, rover localization, and path planning; these\nare key techniques for the GN&C systems of the rover.\n\n19.3.3.1 Terrain Mapping\nOnce a rover is deployed on a planetary body, it must first\nmeasure terrain features (terrain mapping). 3D information\nfrom the terrain map can be exploited to assess obstacle\nsize, slope angle, or terrain roughness so that the rover can\nplan the path to travel on the map. In addition, an aug-\nmented map of the terrain environment can be generated\nfrom consecutive maps.\n\nStereo vision (i.e., visual information taken by a ste-\nreoscopic camera mounted on the rover) is a particular\ntechnique by which to obtain 3D terrain mapping [92, 96].\nAn example of the stereo vision results from a MER (Spirit)\n\nis shown in Fig. 19.16 [94]. The bottom image of the figure\nshows an elevation plot of the scene taken from stereo\ncameras.\n\nSufficient progress in terms of radiation-hardened flight\nCPUs for space probes in the last few decades accelerated\nthe on-board stereo vision process, but stereo camera-based\nterrain mapping is still a time-consuming task for the low-\npower CPU on the rover because stereo images should be\ncorrelated to one another by stereo matching, thus requiring\na relatively long computational time [94]. Also, the visual\ninformation provided by the camera may vary with the\nintensity of sunlight.\n\nAnother technique for terrain mapping is the use of a\nlaser range-finder (LRF) or laser imaging detection and\nranging (LIDAR) that can determine the distance from a\nlaser emitter to an object based on the time-of-flight prin-\nciple. There has been extensive research and development\nin which the LIDAR technique was used in robotics for\nsensing the environment and for classifying the terrain [97,\n98]. In particular, the Defense Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (DARPA) Ground Challenge and Urban Challenge\nprograms have accelerated the development of LIDAR and\nits implementation for robotic mobile vehicles [99, 100].\nFigure 19.17 represents an example of LIDAR-based terrain\nmapping.\n\nAlthough a space-hardened LIDAR was used for the\nrendezvous and docking of the Space Shuttle to the Inter-\nnational Space Station [101, 102], as of 2012, no actual\nrover has been equipped with LIDAR. Several research and\ndevelopment efforts have been reported that introduce\nLIDAR techniques and applications for a rover [103\u2013105].\n\nThe LRF can measure 3D distances from the sensor to\nobjects, providing a \u2018point cloud\u2019 of data of the scene\nwithout additional processes (c.f., camera-based mapping\nneeds stereo matching for the 3D mapping). A drawback of\nthe LIDAR sensor is that the scanning mechanism including\nthe actuators and their movable parts may be less durable\nduring launch vibrations and/or landing shocks. Alterna-\ntively, as a solid-state LIDAR sensor, a 3D flash LIDAR\nimaging system, is being developed that can capture the\nreal-time 3D depth and intensity of a scene. The flash\nLIDAR consists of CMOS-based avalanche photodiode\ndetectors, each pixel of which enables the measurement of\nthe range and intensity of the light illuminated by the laser.\nTherefore, the flash LIDAR acts like a 2D image-plus-depth\ncamera that achieves the relatively fast capturing of the\nterrain without any movable parts and actuators.\n\n19.3.3.2 Localization\nA rover needs to measure and update its position and ori-\nentation during its travel on the map obtained. An accurate\nmeasurement of position and orientation is challenging\nbecause the globally aided navigation schemes, such as the\n\n10 The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter launched by NASA achieved\n0.3 m resolution with a high-resolution imaging science experiment\n(HiRISE) camera.\n\n562 K. Yoshida et al.\n\n\n\nglobal positioning system (GPS), or heading reference rel-\native to a global magnetic field is not available on planetary\nbodies.\n\nThe internal state sensors such as an inertial measure-\nment unit (IMU) and wheel encoders are often used to\nachieve a position/pose estimation of the rover by dead\nreckoning. A sophisticated estimate method with a Kalman\nfilter may be applied to reduce measurement noise. A pose\nestimation method using stereo imagery with learning from\nprevious examples of traversing similar terrain was pro-\nposed by [106, 107]. The MERs have exploited Sun sensing\nwith their cameras for occasional heading updates [108].\n\nOdometry using wheel encoders is a traditional approach\nto measuring distance traveled; however, it may not be\nreliable if the rover travels on sandy loose terrain in which\nthe wheels slip, resulting in incorrect calculations of dis-\ntance traveled with respect to wheel rotations. The errors\naccumulate over time and will degrade the accuracy of the\nposition estimation. To resolve this drawback, image-based\n\nodometry, termed visual odometry, has been widely applied\nto planetary rovers [108\u2013110]. Visual odometry estimates\nthe traveling velocity of the vehicle using the optical flow\nvectors between the time-consecutive images taken by an\non-board camera(s). Integrating the velocity estimates with\nIMU readouts or stereo images for pose estimation provides\nan accurate estimation of the six degrees of freedom of the\nrover\u2019s motion. The visual odometry system of the MER\nwas used for more than 14 %11 of its first 10.7 km of travel\n[110].\n\nFor the MERs, a bundle adjustment technique was\nimplemented to update and correct rover localization. The\ntechnique uses a stereo pair image and manually selected\ntie-points on the images to create a geometric configuration\nof the image. The accumulated images taken day by day\n\nFig. 19.16 MER (Spirit)\nhazcams stereo imagery results\n(from [94])\n\nFig. 19.17 LIDAR-based\nterrain mapping result (from\n[126])\n\n11 A high computational burden is the reason for such a short usage of\nthe visual odometry.\n\n19 Space Robotics 563\n\n\n\npropagate the entire image network and determine the\nglobal position of the rover on the map [108].\n\n19.3.3.3 Path Planning\nThe latency in communicating between Earth and the rover\non a planetary body often impedes direct teleoperation;\ntherefore, the rover must possess a high degree of autono-\nmous mobility for traversing unknown rough terrain. One\nprimary task for such autonomy is to find a feasible path on\nthe map generated by the on-board sensors and to avoid\nmobility hazards.\n\nSubstantial works dedicated to the path/motion planning\nof mobile robots have been performed, such as the A* and\nD* methods [111], the potential field approach [112], the\nprobabilistic roadmap technique [113], and the rapidly\nexploring random tree (RRT) algorithm [114]. Randomized\napproaches to kinodynamic motion planning [115] have\nbeen reported to be an efficient tool for the purpose of path\ngeneration, with RRTs proving to be a highly effective\nframework. Also, a heuristically biased expansion for gen-\nerating efficient paths that satisfy dynamic constraints has\nbeen developed by [116]. Explicit modeling of a robot\u2019s\nclosed-loop controller in the planning method, which results\nin trackable paths, has also been studied [117].\n\nRobotic mobility in path planning is important for field\nconditions in which terrain inclination, roughness, and\nmechanical properties can significantly degrade a rover\u2019s\nmobility. Path generation techniques that consider robotic\nmobility have also been investigated. For example, a tra-\njectory generation method on rough terrain, accounting for\npredictable vehicle dynamics, has been proposed [118]. A\nplanning algorithm with model-based evaluations, which\ninclude the uncertainties of terrain measurement and rover\nlocalization, has been developed [59]. In addition, a terrain\ntraversability index with fuzzy logic for mobile robot nav-\nigation has been introduced [119], and its terrain travers-\nability map has been used for the path planning of planetary\nrovers [120]. An explicit consideration of the dynamic\nmobility of a rover in path planning and an energy-based\nevaluation of candidate paths has been proposed [121], see\nFig. 19.18.\n\nThe MERs have autonomous navigation with hazard\navoidance technology based on a local path planner called\nGESTALT (i.e., grid-based estimation of surface travers-\nability applied to local terrain, see Fig. 19.19) [93, 122].\nThe local terrain map created by the on-board stereo camera\npair is a grid-based map, with each grid containing a\ngoodness value indicating the terrain traversability. Then,\nseveral candidate trajectories, including forward and back-\nward arcs, and two-point turns are evaluated. The trajectory\nthat has the best goodness value is chosen and then the rover\nexecutes the predetermined distance and trajectory. The\nflight software of the MER has been upgraded to manage\n\nconflict voting between hazard avoidance and waypoint\nselection, achieving simultaneous local and global path\nplanning with the Field D* algorithm [123\u2013125].\n\n19.4 Telerobotics\n\nTelerobotics is a technology developed for the remote\ncontrol of space robots. The primary purpose is the handling\nof the communication time delays that occur during tele-\noperation from the ground to a robot in orbit or on the\nMoon. A communication time delay of 4\u20137 s usually occurs\nin such teleoperation, which is the inherent time lag that\naffects most communications equipment used for transmit-\nting telemetry data. In teleoperation between the Earth and\nMars, for example, the time delay is as much as several\nminutes and is largely dependent on the distance.12 This\nforces the operator to adopt a move-and-wait strategy in\nexecuting remote tasks. The operator has to await the\nresponse and check it with each command sent. Accord-\ningly, the extended communication time delay reduces\nefficiency and increases waiting time [127].\n\nMeanwhile, a hierarchical structure can be seen in the\ntask shown in Fig. 19.20. A higher-level (complex) task\ncomprises multiple lower-level (simpler) tasks and this\npyramid structure relates to the level of autonomy. Upper-\nlevel tasks require a higher level of autonomy. From the\nperspective of the operator-robot relationship, higher-level\ncommands can reduce command frequency, and conse-\nquently the checking frequency and the overall waiting\ntime. Accordingly, higher-level autonomy ease the adverse\neffects of the communication time delay. This is a basic\nconcept of telerobotics and a standard framework for space\nteleoperation.\n\nConversely, direct teleoperation by means of a joystick is\na typical example of the use of lower-level commands.\nGenerally, such systems are significantly affected by com-\nmunication time delay. However, joystick systems are one\nof the key framework elements of teleoperation, including\nspace teleoperation, since short-distance teleoperation from\n\n12 The latency is a summation of the propagation time of the radio\nwave and the delays of signal processing in the computers and\ncommunications nodes. For example, in case of the ISS at 400 km\naltitude, the direct round-trip radio-propagation delay is just 0.003 s.\nBut if the communication is linked via a geostationary satellite at\n36,000 km altitude, the round trip delay increases to 0.5 s. The ETS-\nVII, which was a low-Earth orbit satellite at about 550 km altitude,\nutilized the round-trip of two different geostationary satellites and,\nwith cumulative delays in the transmission nodes, the total latency was\n5\u20136 s in practice. Between the Earth and the Moon, the round-trip\ndelay due to just the distance is 2.5 s. For the Mars, it varies from 6.2\nto 45 min depending on the relative positions of Earth and Mars in\ntheir orbits.\n\n564 K. Yoshida et al.\n\n\n\ncabins are not subject to serious communication time\ndelays. Direct teleoperation is part of telerobotics.\n\n19.4.1 Direct Teleoperation\n\nDirect teleoperation utilizes continuous low-level com-\nmands, e.g. the position or velocity of the end-effector, and\nincludes control approaches. In unilateral control, the\noperator commands the position or velocity of the end-\neffector, but the motions of the remote robot are not sig-\nnaled to the operator except for visual information. The\njoystick is the most popular input device for unilateral\ncontrol. Meanwhile, a master\u2013slave manipulator system is\nutilized for bilateral control. The master arm is an input\ndevice, while the slave arm is a remote manipulator. The\nmaster arm can display both the motion and force of the\nslave arm. The force information is very useful in under-\ntaking skillful tasks. However, bilateral control is not part of\nmainstream space teleoperation, because it is significantly\naffected by communication time delay. To date, only a few\nadvanced experiments of bilateral control between the\nground and robots in orbit have been performed.\n\n19.4.2 Unilateral Control\n\nRate control is the most popular approach to unilateral\ncontrol when teleoperating a robot with a joystick. The\nSRMS (Shuttle Remote Manipulator System) also employs\nrate control with joysticks in the cabin. In the SRMS, two\njoysticks named the Translational Hand Controller (THC)\nand Rotational Hand Controller (RHC) are used for trans-\nlational and rotational motions, respectively, as shown in\nFig. 19.21. A 6-axis joystick, e.g. SpaceMouse by 3D\nconnection, is also available on the ground, but the com-\nbination of THC and RHC has become the standard space\napplication input device due to its long history. Astronauts\nin particular prefer this combination, because they have\nextensively trained with the devices for extended periods.\nBoth the JEMRMS (Japan Experiment Module Remote\nManipulator System) and Canadarm2 also employed these\ntwo joysticks.\n\nAs noted earlier, communication time delay is a critical\nissue in space teleoperation from the ground. Predictive dis-\nplay was introduced in [128] to address this. The predictive\ndisplay function indicates the future position of the manipu-\nlator by computer graphics, whereupon the operator can\n\nFig. 19.18 Path planning and\nevaluation simulation (from\n[121])\n\nFig. 19.19 Illustration of terrain\nassessment and path selection.\nRed cells indicate unsafe areas\naround the large rock, yellow\ncells indicate traversable but\nrougher areas around the smaller\nrock, and green cells indicate\nsafe and flat areas (from [122])\n\n19 Space Robotics 565\n\n\n\nteleoperate the remote manipulator as if there were no time\ndelay. Accordingly, the predictive display improves opera-\ntional efficiency, even for low-level commands, as the oper-\nator can continuously send commands that resemble higher-\nlevel commands but include a range of lower levels ones. This\nreduces the checking frequency required and mitigates the\nadverse effects of the communication time delay.\n\nThere have been very few attempts at direct teleoperation\nfrom the ground involving real space robots in orbit. RO-\nTEX (Robot Technology Experiment), developed by DLR,\nachieved the first direct teleoperation from the ground [129].\nThis involved a 6-axis Space Ball employed as the input\ndevice, whereby a precise simulator in a ground-based\nworkstation that predicted the robot motion and the envi-\nronment in which to compensate for the communication time\ndelay. The simulator included both geometrical and dynamic\nmodels. It predicted the motions of a floating object. The\nETS-VII (Engineering Test Satellite No. 7) developed by\nNASDA (currently JAXA) also achieved direct teleopera-\ntion from the ground by joysticks and rate control [130].\n\nIn practice, rate commands are integrated on the ground,\nand the results are sent in the form of positional information\nto the remote robot in orbit, which comprehensively pro-\ntects its motion when the communications link is broken.\n\n19.4.3 Bilateral Control\n\nBilateral control is achieved by a master\u2013slave manipulator\nsystem. Initially, a master\u2013slave manipulator with the same\nstructure and DOF was employed. Currently however, a\ndifferent structural master arm is often used, because the\nmotion of the end-effector is a critical issue. It should be\nnoted that if the slave arm has redundant motion, an addi-\ntional approach is required to operate the redundant joint\nwith a different structural master arm. Through the master\u2013\nslave manipulator, the operator can sense both the motion\nand force at the remote site. Although, the slave arm exe-\ncutes the force of the operator, the communication time\ndelay makes some bilateral controls impossible. In response,\n[131] introduced a scattering transformation approach that\nensures system stability. However, the master arm must have\n\na heavier operational feeling to ensure stability, given the\nextended communication time delay. In practice, the\nacceptable limit for communication time delays is less than\none second, which means that bilateral control cannot be\nused for Earth-based teleoperation of robots in orbit which\nentails a communication time delay of several seconds.\n\nA few attempts at master\u2013slave control of a real orbital\nrobot have been made. ETS-VII carried out experiments\nwith a master arm [132], in whcih bilateral control was\nlocally achieved by means of a virtual model on the ground.\nThe reference position, based on the reference force exerted\nby the operator, was sent to the slave arm, which executed\nthe reference force by compliance control. The remote\nenvironment should be known in such a process. Further-\nmore, real bilateral control in a large loop, that includes the\nground and the orbit was also executed on ETS-VII [133].\nThe operator could feel the remote force with a communi-\ncation time delay of almost 7 s, but it was difficult to apply\nthe approach to practical tasks as mentioned above.\nMeanwhile, the ROKVISS (RObotics Component Verifi-\ncation on ISS) developed by DLR also achieved bilateral\ncontrol [134]. In this project, a round trip delay of 10\u201320 ms\nwas achieved, because the operator site on the ground was\ndirectly connected to the ISS, making reasonable bilateral\ncontrol possible.\n\n19.4.4 Supervisory Control\n\nSupervisory Control is a concept proposed by Sheridan\nwhich includes not only telerobotics but also various semi-\nautonomous systems [135, 136]. The term \u2018supervisory\ncontrol\u2019 has a longer history than that of telerobotics and\nestablishes a framework for the relationship between\nhumans and semi-autonomous systems. Basically, humans\nissue higher-level commands and monitor the results as\nsupervisors, while semi-autonomous systems execute the\ncommands as subordinates. Similar relationships can be\nfound, not only in space robots but also various other sys-\ntems. Fig. 19.22 shows a typical example of supervisory\ncontrol in a space robot system. The robot achieves semi-\nautonomous functions with local loops based on various\n\nUpper level\n\nLower level\n\nOperatorRobot\n\nAutonomy\n\nTask Command\n\nFig. 19.20 Task level and\ncommand level\n\n566 K. Yoshida et al.\n\n\n\nsensors. On the control site, the operator sends commands\nvia a computer-assisted Human Interface (HI). The Human\nInteractive Computer (HIC) includes a model of the remote\nenvironment and an expert advisory system, based on prior\ninformation. The HIC also interacts with the operator\nthrough sensors and actuators. Autonomy on the HI side is\ntherefore also important. In ROTEX, a multisensory gripper\nthat included various sensors was a key technology for\nachieving good performance. Intelligent sensory feedback\ncapabilities compensate for errors that the predictive gra-\nphic simulator cannot handle.\n\n19.4.5 Relationship Between Humans\nand Systems\n\nEnsuring a reasonable relationship between humans and\nsystems depends on both applications and the current level\nof technology. The first question that must be asked is\nwhether humans always maintain superior positions to\nsystems. Supervisory control clearly depicts humans acting\nas supervisors and making the final decisions. Shared con-\ntrol and traded control however, show different frameworks\nafford flat relationships. Humans perform the tasks to which\nthey are best suited, and robots also do likewise in\naccomplishing difficult tasks that cannot be achieved with-\nout assistance. In shared control, a task is simultaneously\nshared between a human and a robot. For example, the\nhuman controls the trajectory of the end-effector in grasping\na glass full of water, while the robot keeps the water from\nspilling. Task sharing is a key feature of shared control.\nConversely, in traded control, humans and robots work in\nturn, which means the tasks are divided by time. For\nexample, a human firstly decides on the path plan, where-\nupon the robot checks for possible collisions with obstacles.\nAlternation timing is a major aspect of in traded control.\n\nThe relationship between humans and robots is a subject\nof debate, not only in space robotics, but also in the human\nfactors in the U.S. and ergonomics in Europe. Human fac-\ntors research started by analyzing airplane accidents that\noccurred during World War II. Currently, both words are\nused for the same meaning. These fields show the value of\nenhancing safety.\n\nIn Germany, the 30 min rule is well known for nuclear\npower plants. In emergencies, the system should handle all\ntrouble during the first 30 min. In other words, the human\noperator should not intervene in the operation during this\nperiod, but instead gather information and prepare the best\nsolution. This protects against human errors caused by panic\nand is made possible by the slow process of nuclear power\nplants. It is noteworthy that during the first 30 min the system\nadopts a superordinate stance compared to that of humans.\n\nConversely, in shared control, there is the potential for\nthe actions of humans to conflict with those of robots. The\noperator should recognize what is happening in the system,\notherwise a serious accident may occur. Regardless of cir-\ncumstances, the relationship between humans and systems\nshould be designed to avoid human errors. In space robots,\nserious failure is unacceptable due to the cost involved,\nwhile safety for astronauts is paramount. The scope of\nactivities in space is expanding to include work in orbit, on\nthe Moon, on Mars and beyond. More critical work would\nbe necessary, which would require the establishment of a\nproper relationship between humans and systems.\n\n19.4.6 Human Interface\n\nThe operator teleoperates a remote robot via a human\ninterface. An intuitive and easily understandable human\ninterface should be provided. A wire-frame graphic model\nmay be superimposed on a real video image to show a\npredictive display, as in [137]. Conversely, the real video\n\nFig. 19.21 Astronaut Leroy\nChiao, expedition 10 commander\nand NASA ISS science officer,\nworks with the controls of the\nCanadarm2, or space station\nremote manipulator system\n(SSRMS) in the Destiny\nlaboratory of the International\nSpace Station (18 October 2004).\nImage NASA\n\n19 Space Robotics 567\n\n\n\nimage is installed into the 3D graphic model as texture to\nunderstand the camera posture in [138]. It is therefore\nimportant to display incomprehensible invisible informa-\ntion, for which a multi-modal interface, including voice, is a\nkey technology. For Robonaut-2 a novel interface was\ndeveloped where the motions of the operator are captured\nby a motion tracking system and a head-mounted display is\nemployed to enhance presence; see Fig. 19.23. Robonaut-2\ndirectly follows human motions but includes an indexing\nfunction because of the difference in size. This indexing\nallows each motion to be connected and disconnected with\n\nan offset, which means the operator can intuitively teleop-\nerate Robonaut-2. The interface of Robonaut-2 targets\ntelepresence.\n\n19.4.7 Telerobotics with a Rover\n\nRovers have also been managed under the concept of tele-\nrobotics and supervisory control, whereby the operator\nplays a crucial role. There are three key points compared\nwith space telemanipulation\n\nEnvironement\nActuator\n\nSensor\n\nHuman Interactive\nComputer\n\nInput Device\n\nSensor\nActuator\n\nCommand, Request\n\nAdvice\nDisplay, Sound, etc.\n\nOperator\n\nTeleoperator, RobotFig. 19.22 An example of\nsupervisory control\n\nFig. 19.23 Human interface for\nRobonaut 2\n\n568 K. Yoshida et al.\n\n\n\n(1) The workplace is far from Earth.\n(2) The rover operates in an unknown environment.\n(3) The rover collects explorative information and sends it\n\nto Earth.\nIt is unreasonable to send continuous low-level com-\n\nmands to a rover on Mars, as the communication time delay\ncan be several minutes. This increases the value of auton-\nomous capabilities. Moreover, it is impossible to provide a\npreliminary remote environment model, meaning more\nadvanced supervisory control is required. The key tech-\nnology is simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM),\nwhereby localization and mapping is provided using a laser\nrange-finder or stereo camera.\n\nThe main purpose of the rover is exploration, which\nrequires high-level decision making. The rover supplies\nuseful information to the scientists involved in the project\nby satisfying their requirements. The exploration of Mars by\nrovers started with Sojourner, which was followed by Spirit,\nthen Opportunity (which remained operational for an\nunexpectedly long time), and then Curiosity. Curiosity is\nsignificantly larger then its predecessors and can travel\ngreater distances, showing that the level of autonomy is\nrapidly improving.\n\nReferences\n\n1. D. L. Akin, M. L. Minsky, E.

Note that launch infrastructure is not\nnormally considered to be part of the ground segment.\n\nThe \u2018technology\u2019 focus of the ground segment is mainly\non IT-based systems and communications, but these tools\nare primarily a \u2018means to an end\u2019. Operators of the mission\nmust have a strong, broad, and deep understanding of the\ndesign of the spacecraft itself\u2014particularly with respect to\nthe on-board software, interconnectivity of subsystems and\ntheir relative physical configuration. This technical knowl-\nedge is combined with a strong \u2018human factors\u2019 element and\na need for robust processes and procedures to be designed\nand followed by the engineers and managers who fly the\nmission.\n\nActivities can be divided into two general domains:\ncontrol and monitoring of the satellite platform (imple-\nmented through the flight operations segment, sometimes\nalso referred to as the ground control segment); and oper-\nation and exploitation of the payload (implemented through\nthe payload data ground segment, or ground mission seg-\nment). For both satellite platform and payload, it is normal\nto make extensive use of standard IT hardware, but with\nsoftware that is developed specifically for spacecraft oper-\nations and data processing.\n\nRadio-frequency and optical technologies are also used\nfor communications links and tracking of spacecraft, and\nthese are addressed in Chap. 14.\n\nIt should be noted that, unlike other areas of space\nengineering, the approach to ground segment software and\n\noperational practices for a mission is as much a methodol-\nogy choice as a technological one.\n\nThis chapter based upon the approach adopted by the\nEuropean Space Agency.\n\n20.1 Flight Operations Segment\n\nThis section provides an overview of the operation of the\nspacecraft platform. Note that the operation of the space-\ncraft payload may require additional distinct systems and\nprocesses of its own\u2014e.g. for the management of data\nchannels on a communications payload, or for the genera-\ntion of a navigation signal in the case of systems like GPS\nor Galileo. Nevertheless, in most cases the physical hard-\nware of the payload is managed through the same systems,\nand by the same team, as the main spacecraft platform.\n\nThe goal of the flight operations segment is to give the\nspacecraft operator the tools required to reliably and effi-\nciently control the spacecraft in order to support the mis-\nsion\u2019s aims. Successful control of the platform is a\nnecessary (though not normally sufficient) condition for\ncompleting the mission. As an example, it is instructive to\nconsider the case of a geostationary communications\nsatellite. The system will be used to ensure that the satellite\nremains in the correct orbit and in the correct orientation,\nthat sufficient power is always available to the payload, and\nthat the operational lifetime of the satellite is maximized.\nThese goals ensure that the payload is supported in doing its\njob\u2014however, they are independent of the payload\u2019s own\ncomplex task, which is to receive and retransmit data\nchannels for terrestrial users (e.g. television broadcast,\nmobile phones, Internet traffic, etc.).\n\nIn other mission types, the operation of the spacecraft\nplatform and the operation of the payload may be tightly\ncoupled. As an example, Earth observation satellites may\nrequire the whole satellite to reorientate itself for each\n\nR. Lowe (&) ? D. Kent ? P. Coutinho ? K. Halsall\nTelespazio VEGA UK Ltd.

In such cases, the distinction between\noperation of the payload and the platform is far weaker.\n\nIn either case, the manner in which operators go about\ncontrolling the spacecraft is as important as the underlying\ntechnology. To draw a terrestrial parallel, a mission may be\nthought of in similar terms to a remotely operated aircraft.\nThe aircraft itself embodies the majority of the aeronautical\nengineering technology. The operator\u2019s control system must\nbe designed in order to provide the best possible interface\nfor flying the aircraft. The operator must adopt suitable\npractices for minimizing risk of human error.\n\n20.1.1 Flight Operations Procedures\n\nThis section introduces the concept of the flight operations\nprocedure (FOP). Note that this abbreviation FOP is\nsometimes also used to refer to the flight operations plan,\nwhich is a document that contains all the spacecraft\nprocedures.\n\nSpacecraft procedures are designed to prevent critical\nerrors from being made when commanding the spacecraft.\nThey describe, in step-by-step detail, the process of com-\nmanding the spacecraft (and ground systems) in order to\nachieve a specific objective. It is common practice for\nspacecraft operators to use procedures as the basis of every\ncommand that they send. The implications of sending the\nwrong command (or omitting a required command) can be\nvery serious indeed.\n\nA procedure will normally include the following items of\ninformation\n\u2022 A description of the task that the procedure is designed to\n\ncarry out (e.g. switch on payload).\n\u2022 A description of start conditions, describing the state that\n\nthe spacecraft and/or the unit that is being commanded\nmust be in, before beginning the procedure.\n\n\u2022 A description of end conditions, describing the state that\nthe spacecraft and/or the unit that is being commanded\nwill be in, after successfully completing the procedure.\n\n\u2022 At each step of the procedure\n\u2013 Telemetry to check and values to expect.\n\u2013 Telecommands to send and parameters to set.\n\u2013 Timing and conditions for commanding, telemetry and\n\non-board events (\u2018IF/THEN\u2019, \u2018WAIT\u2019 steps etc.).\n\u2022 References to other procedures that may be called on to\n\nperform subsidiary tasks (e.g. \u2018Prepare for Payload\nswitch-on\u2019).\n\n\u2022 References to other documents that contain detailed\noperational information, for example memory addresses\nto be set in telecommand parameters.In short, the pro-\ncedure must give as much relevant detail as possible to\nthe spacecraft controller or operations engineer.\n\nFor infrequently used procedures, literally years may\nelapse between the writing of the procedure and its use to\ncommand the spacecraft. Thus, it is very important to\nrecord as much knowledge as possible as a reminder for\nwhen that day arrives.\nMost procedures will be developed in the period up to\n\nthree years prior to the launch of the spacecraft (with this\nduration depending upon the complexity and novelty of the\nspacecraft design). This ensures that operations engineers\nhave enough time to properly assess and address all the\npotential problems involved in any procedure. Procedures\nfor instrument preparation are typically developed nearer to\nlaunch.\n\nAll the procedures that are developed make their way\ninto the FOP, which becomes the reference for all aspects of\nspacecraft operations planning. It defines when, where, and\nhow all spacecraft actions will take place. It may be orga-\nnized into Nominal, contingency, and test procedures.\n\n20.1.1.1 Nominal Operation Procedures\nAs the name suggests, this refers to all procedures used\nunder normal (or \u2018nominal\u2019) conditions. This includes\n\u2022 One-off procedures such as may occur during the launch\n\nand early orbit phase, e.g. as solar array deployment or\nperigee boost burns.\n\n\u2022 Routine operations that are used on a regular basis\nthroughout the mission, e.g. eclipse monitoring or battery\nreconditioning.\n\n20.1.1.2 Contingency Operation Procedures\nThese procedures are used to recover from an off-nominal\nsituation, and in some cases can be highly time critical. An\nexample might include the case where the operator must\nrecover the spacecraft from a situation where all computer\nand avionics units have switched over to the redundant\n(backup) hardware following a serious attitude de-pointing\n(i.e. misalignment of the spacecraft body). In this case, the\ncontingency procedures may be called by an overarching\nleading procedure or flow chart, which guides the operator\nto diagnose which unit may have failed and to then select\nthe appropriate procedures required to switch all non-failed\nunits back to their nominal sides.\n\nThe hours immediately following launcher separation are\na particularly critical time for contingency operations. The\noperations team must be prepared to respond quickly and\ncorrectly to a fault condition, or risk partial or total loss of\nthe mission. For this reason, a wide range of contingency\nprocedures will be prepared which cover all reasonable fault\nscenarios. Many of these procedures will apply only during\nthis initial launch period and, if not required, will never be\nused. Nevertheless, their preparation is an important part of\nthe risk reduction process.\n\n576 R. Lowe et al.\n\n\n\n20.1.1.3 Test Procedures\nTest procedures are devised specifically for spacecraft (or\nground infrastructure) test purposes including system veri-\nfication tests (SVT) that are performed prior to launch, and\nin-orbit testing (IOT) procedures.\n\nThe purpose of such procedures is not to achieve a\nspecific mission objective, but rather to assess the status of\nthe spacecraft (and/or ground systems) and to ensure that\nthe full mission system (spacecraft and ground segment) is\noperating as expected.\n\n20.1.1.4 Classification by Subsystem\nProcedures can also be further subdivided among the vari-\nous subsystems of the spacecraft discussed elsewhere in this\nHandbook, including\n\u2022 Attitude and orbital control subsystem (AOCS), also\n\nknown as the attitude determination and control subsys-\ntem (ADCS)\n\n\u2022 Electrical power subsystem (EPS)\n\u2022 Telemetry, tracking, and commanding (TT&C), also\n\nknown as telemetry, commanding, and ranging (TCR)\n\u2022 Payload\n\u2022 Thermal control subsystem (TCS)\n\u2022 On-board data handling subsystem (OBDH), also known\n\nas the data handling subsystem (DHS).Procedures are very\nspecific to the platform/bus and to the payload of the\nspacecraft. There is additional variation when operating a\nsatellite constellation, which may comprise similar\nspacecraft of various ages and levels of design evolution,\nall being controlled and monitored by the same operations\ncenter. Irrespective of any design differences, each indi-\nvidual spacecraft develops a distinct \u2018personality\u2019 over\ntime due to anomalies, failures, and other operational\nconstraints (such as fuel depletion, or varying thruster\nefficiencies). These differences will lead to the creation of\nfurther procedures specific to a given spacecraft.\n\n20.1.1.5 Automation\nFor modern ground control systems, automation of opera-\ntions may be possible (though not always appropriate). The\ndecision to automate is often about the return on invest-\nment. Automation represents a significant investment of\neffort, which may not be worthwhile for a short-lived mis-\nsion. However, there may be major economic benefits when\nconsidering fleet or long-term operations. Throughout the\nlife of a spacecraft, it is common for the engineers of the\nflight control team to automate simple, routine operations.\n\nAutomation requires that the manually derived algo-\nrithms from the (already scrutinized) procedures be trans-\nlated into computer code. The decision to automate\nprocedures must be taken with careful consideration. There\nis considerably less margin for error when creating an\nautomated procedure to be executed by the control system\n\n(or the spacecraft). Without human operators, and their\nengineering judgment, simple mistakes may go undetected.\nThis moves more of the operational emphasis and respon-\nsibility to the engineers and analysts (who prepare the\nautomation scripts) and away from the operators them-\nselves. Nevertheless, there are clear benefits to be gained in\nautomating procedures. The human operator is both a filter\nof, and a source of mistakes. In particular, frequently\nrepeated yet simple operations may be more reliably per-\nformed by automation than by a human operator.\n\nNot all procedures will be, or even can be, automated (at\nleast, not without excessive use of resources). Routine\noperations can often be carried out under automation, and in\nmany cases for newer spacecraft designs, are carried out on-\nboard by the spacecraft control unit (SCU), for example, the\nswitching of heaters in response to temperature variations.\nThe automation can take the form of a small software\nprogram uploaded to the satellite, referred to as an on-board\ncontrol procedure (OBCP). Contingency actions can also be\ncoded for response by both the ground computer systems\nand the SCU, but it is impracticable for all possible con-\ntingencies to be foreseen, and a human/engineering link\nmust remain. Automated procedures may still be monitored\nby a spacecraft controller as a precaution.\n\nAutomation implemented through the on-board software\n(OBSW) may provide valuable resilience to hardware fault\nconditions, and reduce the effort needed to operate under\nnominal conditions. Nevertheless, the added complexity of\nthe control software introduces its own risks, and may drive\na need for greater expertise in the operations team to handle\nproblems occurring in the OBSW itself.\n\n20.1.1.6 Procedure Validation\nA procedure can be seen as an algorithm. It gives explicit\ndirection based on simple, clear logic. Since all commands\nthat will be sent to the spacecraft should come only from a\nprocedure, the level of detail must be high and strictly\nadhered to. Any step involving human judgment should be\nscrutinized to ensure that the exercise of such judgment is\nnecessary. If not, then further development of the procedure\nshould be considered. For this reason, rigorous cross-\nchecking and auditing processes are recommended in order\nto ensure the procedures are as accurate, complete, and clear\nas possible.\n\nProcedural validation is a process that can take several\nyears. The genesis of the procedure comes from information\nderived from the manufacturer\u2019s Spacecraft User Manuals\n(SUM) or Orbital Operations Handbooks (OOH), other\ntechnical documentation and design engineers\u2019 expertise.\n\nFollowing initial generation of the procedure, the\nchecking and reviewing process must be comprehensive.\nProcedures must be rigorously tested against the spacecraft\nsimulator (see Sect. 20.1.5). In addition, as many of the\n\n20 Ground Segment 577\n\n\n\nprocedures as possible are also tested on the spacecraft\nduring SVTs or on an engineering model if one is available.\n\nA completed, checked, validated, and authorized proce-\ndure is not a \u2018final\u2019 product. Procedures must be continually\nreevaluated for their currency, throughout the lifetime of the\nmission. Spacecraft configuration changes according to\nmission requirements, anomalies, failures, ground con-\nstraints/problems, as well as countless other planned and\nunplanned events. Procedures must also evolve in response\nto changes in the spacecraft\u2019s telemetry and telecommand\ndatabase (and vice versa).\n\nValidation of procedures may be performed in layers\ninvolving evolving, separate organizations. For example,\ntheir maintenance may require the participation of the\nspacecraft manufacturer, the spacecraft operations team,\npayload instrument experts, or flight dynamics support teams.\n\nThis ensures that the procedures are scrutinized from the\ndifferent points of view that come from the various fields of\nexpertise. Typically, the flight control team will retain\noverall responsibility for the FOP.\n\n20.1.2 Mission Control Systems\n\nThis section describes general features commonly found in\nMission Control Systems (MCS). The description that fol-\nlows is based primarily on the European Space Agency\u2019s\nSatellite Control and Operation System (SCOS), though\nmost features will have analogs in other commonly used\nsystems.1\n\n20.1.2.1 General Features\nThe primary purpose of the MCS is to give an operator the\nnecessary tools to understand the state of the spacecraft, and\nassist in safely commanding the spacecraft. It is the system\nthrough which the operator interfaces with the spacecraft. It\ndisplays the telemetry (TM) received from the spacecraft as\nwell as the status of ground station visibility and links. It\nalso provides an interface through which commands are\nsent to the spacecraft.\n\nThe MCS performs a number of functions with the\nreceived telemetry\n\u2022 Archiving and retrieval\u2014All TM received is stored, and\n\nmay be retrieved at a later time.\n\u2022 Display\u2014The status of the spacecraft, as reported\n\nthrough telemetry, is presented to the user. This may be\ndone in simple textual form (name/value pairs), as a\n\ngraph, or as a display in which the state of the spacecraft\nis depicted in a dynamic diagram (e.g. showing switches\nas opened or closed). Such diagrams are referred to as\n\u2018mimics\u2019.\n\n\u2022 Checking\u2014Automatic checks are performed on the\ntelemetry parameters in order to assist the operator in\ndetecting anomalous states. This applies to both passive\nmonitoring of the spacecraft and to the confirmation of\ncorrect processing of commands.\n\n\u2022 Time Correlation\u2014Determination of the offset between\nthe spacecraft\u2019s on-board clock and that used on the\nground is important for time-sensitive commands (e.g. for\nthe timing of an orbit change maneuver or payload\naction). The MCS uses timing information contained in\nthe telemetry stream to measure this offset and feed it\nback into the construction of commands, and the inter-\npretation of telemetry.The MCS assists the operator in\nconstructing and sending commands, also known as\ntelecommands (TC). Important features include\n\n\u2022 Definition and syntax\u2014The MCS enforces the construc-\ntion of well-formed command packets, selected from only\nthose that are defined for the mission, and with all nec-\nessary parameters provided.\n\n\u2022 Time tagging\u2014Commands may be uplinked for delayed\nexecution, at a predefined time (if supported by the\nspacecraft). Alternatively, the MCS may support the\ndelayed transmission of a command for immediate exe-\ncution upon reception. In either case, the MCS should\npermit the operator to monitor the progress of commands,\nand to determine what commands are queued for\nexecution.\n\n\u2022 Pre/post-transmission validation\u2014The MCS may per-\nform checks against the command, both before and after\ntransmission. Pre-transmission checks can be used to\nprevent inappropriate (but syntactically valid) commands\nfrom being sent. Post-transmission checks can be used to\nconfirm correct receipt and execution of the command.\n\n\u2022 Grouping of commands (\u2018stacks\u2019)\u2014The MCS may sup-\nport the preparation (plus save and restore) of groups of\ncommands, for rapid sequential (or simultaneous) release.\nSuch stacks may be referred to from procedures. This\nensures that complex command sequences can be con-\nstructed and checked on the ground, before any of the\nindividual commands are transmitted to the spacecraft. It\nalso permits commands to be executed in rapid sequence,\nwithout using time-tagging functionality.\n\n20.1.2.2 Spacecraft Telemetry/Telecommand\nDatabases\n\nThe spacecraft telemetry/telecommand (TM/TC) database\ncontains detailed information on every single telemetry\nparameter and telecommand.\n\n1 Many MCS implementations are now based upon the internationally\nrecognized standards of the Consultative Committee for Space Data\nSystems (CCSDS). Adherence to these standards allows interopera-\nbility and sharing of infrastructure between operators around the\nworld.\n\n578 R. Lowe et al.\n\n\n\nThe database serves several purposes. Firstly, it provides\nthe operations team with a definition of the structure of all\ntelecommands (and command parameters) and the location\nof all telemetry parameters within the downlinked telemetry\nformat/data packets. It will therefore be delivered to the\nflight control team by the spacecraft manufacturer, and will\nbe used in the preparation of operational procedures (it may\nbe loaded directly by a procedure generation tool in order to\naid in authoring). This ensures that all telecommands and\ntelemetry parameters referred to within the procedure are\n\u2018legal\u2019 and well defined.\n\nSecondly, the database will be loaded by the spacecraft\ncontrol system software in order to enable it to decode the\ndownlinked telemetry and to build telecommands to be\nuplinked.\n\nThe database is also used in the process of writing on-\nboard software, developing mission simulators and defining\nhardware interfaces.\n\nWe now describe some of the common types of infor-\nmation contained within a typical database.\n\nThe following information would typically be included,\nas part of the definition of a telemetry/telecommand\nparameter\n\u2022 Parameter mnemonic\u2014This is a shorthand code for the\n\nparameter, e.g. \u2018A292\u2019 (not encoded in the transmitted\npacket).\n\n\u2022 Parameter name\u2014An abbreviated name of the form\n\u2018BATT1_CELL21_PRESS\u2019 (not encoded in the trans-\nmitted packet).\n\n\u2022 Parameter description\u2014A brief description of the\nparameter, e.g. \u2018Battery 1, Cell 21 Pressure\u2019 (not encoded\nin the transmitted packet).\n\n\u2022 Calibration curve\u2014All parameters require a definition of\ntheir encoding method, to allow interpretation of the\nnumber that is placed in the field. For example, a binary\nparameter may use the value \u20181\u2019 to indicate \u2018True\u2019 or\n\u2018False\u2019, \u2018On\u2019 or \u2018Off\u2019, \u2018Left\u2019 or \u2018Right\u2019, etc. An engi-\nneering value range (e.g. 0\u20130.5 V) may be converted to\nan integer range 0\u2013100 for encoding.\n\n\u2022 Units\u2014If applicable, the units of the engineering values\nwill be specified, e.g. volts, amps, radians.\n\n\u2022 Validity conditions (for TM parameters)\u2014Certain\nparameters are only valid under certain conditions. For\nexample, the output from a pressure transducer may only\nbe valid if the remote terminal which acquires and pro-\ncesses the pressure transducer output voltage signal is\nswitched on. If the remote terminal unit was switched off\nthen the pressure might read zero, which could be incorrect\nand misleading. Validity conditions allow such cases to be\nidentified and handled by the control system (e.g. to pro-\nvide visual indication of a non-valid parameter value).\n\n\u2022 Out-of-limits (OOL) conditions (for TM parameters)\u2014\nMost telemetry parameters will be expected to have\n\nvalues within a certain range to indicate healthy operation\nof the units to which they pertain. Therefore it is useful to\nspecify safe limits on each parameter so that the operator\ncan be alerted if these limits are transgressed. Two types\nof limits may be defined\u2014soft (or warning) limits and\nhard (or alarm) limits. Under normal circumstances, the\nparameter in question would be expected to have a value\nsomewhere between the soft upper and soft lower limits\n(\u2018open\u2019 limit ranges may also be specified\u2014e.g. \u2018greater\nthan n\u2019).\nA concept of \u2018derived parameters\u2019 may also be intro-\n\nduced. These parameters are not downlinked directly in\ntelemetry, but are calculated in the control system from the\ncurrent values of one or more other telemetry parameters\nand/or conditions. For example, the state of charge of a\nbattery might not be measured directly but calculated using\nthe output of one or more battery cell temperatures/pres-\nsures/voltages/charge currents etc. In this case, a derived\nparameter can be calculated by the ground system accord-\ningly and added to the information displayed to the user.\n\nBeyond derivation of parameters, telemetry may also be\nused for trend analysis and fault detection. Appropriate\nmathematical treatment (e.g. statistical analysis) of telem-\netry gathered over a long period can provide evidence of\nequipment degradation prior to an actual failure. Such\nanalysis would typically be performed off-line.\n\nData exchanged between the spacecraft and ground sys-\ntems is transferred in blocks referred to as TM/TC packets.\nPackets must conform to a well-specified structure that\nallows repeatable encoding and decoding without ambiguity.\nTelemetry packets typically contain many individual\nparameters, often grouped into related types or associated\nwith a specific subsystem. For example, a telemetry packet\nmay contain a number of parameters, each representing the\ntemperature in a different part of the spacecraft.\n\nA given packet will reference one or (usually) more\nparameter definitions, and will also include\n\u2022 Packet mnemonic\u2014This is a shorthand code for the\n\npacket, e.g. \u2018P123\u2019 (not encoded in the transmitted\npacket).\n\n\u2022 Packet name\u2014A short, abbreviated name, e.g. \u2018POW-\nER_HK\u2019 (not encoded in the transmitted packet).\n\n\u2022 Packet description\u2014A brief description of the packet,\ne.g. \u2018Power subsystem housekeeping TM\u2019 (not encoded\nin the transmitted packet).\n\n\u2022 Type (and subtype)\u2014A value, encoded within the packet,\nthat allows the structure and purpose of the packet to be\ndetermined by the receiving equipment.For telecom-\nmands, it may also be useful to define automatic checks\nthat should be performed before and after the transmis-\nsion of the command.\n\n\u2022 Pre-transmission validation (PTV)\u2014Also referred to as\npre-control, this is a condition which needs to be satisfied\n\n20 Ground Segment 579\n\n\n\nbefore the command can be dispatched by the ground\ncontrol system, e.g. only permit a \u2018mode change\u2019 com-\nmand if the satellite subsystem concerned is reporting an\nappropriate operational state.\n\n\u2022 Execution verification\u2014Once a command has been sent it\nwill be necessary to verify its execution by checking\ntelemetry. This may be done by associating the command\nwith a telemetry parameter for which a particular value is\nexpected following execution, e.g. telemetry should\nreport \u2018ON\u2019 following a \u2018switch-on\u2019 command.\nA parameter may be encoded in a packet in many ways.\n\nTo ensure consistency between the encoding side (e.g. the\nspacecraft) and the decoding side (e.g. the control system),\nthe method of encoding must be unambiguously defined for\nall parameters; this is termed value encoding and calibration\ncurves. Such information includes the following.\n\u2022 Binary states\u2014e.g. \u2018on\u2019 or \u2018off\u2019; \u2018clockwise\u2019 or \u2018anti-\n\nclockwise\u2019; \u2018present\u2019 or \u2018not present\u2019, etc. Such values\nare normally encoded on a single bit. The calibration\ncurve defines which state maps to \u20180\u2019 and which to \u20181\u2019.\n\n\u2022 Integer and floating point numbers\u2014e.g. \u2018thruster pulse\ncount\u2019, \u2018clock ticks\u2019, \u2018wheel speed\u2019, etc. The use of\nsigned versus unsigned encoding must be indicated, as\nwell as the \u2018width\u2019 (or number of bits) used to contain the\nvalue. A conversion factor (or calibration) may apply,\ne.g. \u2018wheel speed\u2019 may operate in the \u2018engineering\u2019 range\nof 0\u20134,000 RPM, but be encoded as an integer (\u2018raw\u2019)\nvalue between 0 and 255 (with an implied loss of accu-\nracy). This permits the relevant information to be enco-\nded with fewer bits than would otherwise be necessary.\nNote that many methods for encoding integer and float-\ning-point numbers as binary exist, and several may be\nused within a single spacecraft. The precise method for\nrepresenting a number in binary form is an essential part\nof the specification of a parameter.\n\n\u2022 Enumerations\u2014integers used to indicate one amongst a\ndefined list of non-numerical states, e.g. \u20181 = Warm-up\nMode\u2019; \u20182 = Standby Mode\u2019; \u20183 = Off\u2019; \u20184 = Unde-\nfined\u2019. The associated \u2018calibration\u2019 is therefore the defi-\nnition of meaning associated with each discrete numerical\nvalue.\nAs described, it may be necessary to stipulate conditions\n\nfor telemetry validity, telecommand pre-transmission\nvalidity etc., based upon the current value of various\nparameter(s) in telemetry.\n\nValidity checking is performed using \u2018mode equations\u2019,\nwhich are a combination of telemetry parameter values and\nlogical operators. For example, a detected eclipse condition\nmay imply that normal thermal telemetry limits are inap-\npropriate, i.e.\n\u2022 IF (battery is discharging) AND (Sun is not present in\n\nsensor field of view) THEN (assume eclipse condition\nand relax thermal alarm limits)\n\n20.1.2.3 Time Correlation\nKnowledge of the relationship between the spacecraft\u2019s own\nclock and clocks used on the ground is important for the\ncorrect construction and execution of commands, and for\nthe interpretation of telemetry.\n\nIt is not uncommon for spacecraft clocks to measure time\nonly in simple terms of \u2018ticks\u2019 (or hardware cycles) elapsed\nsince a defined \u2018instant\u2019. Say, 10,000 s elapsed since\nlauncher release.\n\nTo make use of this \u2018time\u2019 value (e.g. 10,000) the MCS\nmust know\n\u2022 Offset\u2014The \u2018ground\u2019 time at which the \u2018zero\u2019 epoch\n\noccurred, e.g. launcher release occurred at 10 h 23 m 30.3 s\nInternational Atomic Time (TAI) on 1st January 2012.\n\n\u2022 Rate\u2014The actual elapsed time per \u2018tick\u2019. This must be\nmeasured by comparing the progress of time, according\nto the spacecraft, with the progress of time as measured\nby the ground systems. Inaccuracy in the calibration of\nthe spacecraft clock may result in gradual divergence\nfrom \u2018correct\u2019 time.\n\n\u2022 Rate variation\u2014The rate at which the ground and space-\ncraft clocks diverge may, itself, vary with time. (i.e. the\nspacecraft clock tick quickens or slows).The MCS must\nuse timing information in the telemetry stream to deter-\nmine these values. Accuracy at the level of milliseconds\nmay be required. Nevertheless, many factors affect the\ntime at which a telemetry packet is received by the MCS,\nall of which must be taken into account when determining\nthe true clock calibration. Such factors include\n\n\u2022 Radio propagation delay from the spacecraft to the\nground station (can be many hours for deep space\nmissions).\n\n\u2022 On-board delay between construction of a time stamp (in\na telemetry packet) and the actual RF transmission of the\npacket.\n\n\u2022 Delay in handling and onward transmission by the ground\nstation.\n\n\u2022 Delay in processing at the control center.In order to\ndetermine drift rate, and rate variation, several measure-\nments over a period are necessary and synchronization\nassessment is typically performed as an ongoing activity\nthroughout the mission lifetime.\nNote that changing knowledge of (on-board) clock per-\n\nformance, and changing performance of the clock itself, can\nlead to difficulties in determining the actual time at which an\nevent took place. With a given set of clock characteristics\n(offset, rate, rate variation), a time stamp will be converted to\na certain \u2018ground\u2019 time. However, if future measurements\nlead to a revision in the values of the offset/rate/rate variation\nparameters, then this implicitly changes the time at which an\nearly event is understood to have taken place. Thus, it is\nimportant to retain information about the clock conversion\nparameters that are in use at any given time.\n\n580 R. Lowe et al.\n\n\n\n20.1.2.4 Time (or Orbital Position) Tagging\nThe addition of a time-tag (or an orbital position tag) to a\ncommand, prior to uplink, can be used to facilitate a range\nof operator actions that would otherwise be difficult or\nimpossible.\n\u2022 Out-of-contact commanding\u2014Commands may be up-\n\nlinked during a ground station pass, for execution at a\ntime when a command link will not be available.\n\n\u2022 Critical timing of commands\u2014Pre-loading of commands\nto the spacecraft removes risks associated with command\nlink loss (or delay) at the time of execution (e.g. failure or\nerrors in the operation of the control system, network,\nground stations, link status, etc.). Once commands are\nsafely loaded, only an on-board failure or deletion com-\nmand can prevent their execution.\n\n\u2022 Fail-safe commands\u2014During high-risk operations, com-\nmands may be stored on the spacecraft ready to affect a\nrecovery process in the event that commanding capability\nis (unintentionally) lost. Such commands can be deleted\nfrom the spacecraft before their execution time, if oper-\nations proceed according to plan.\n\n\u2022 Critical delivery of commands\u2014For commands which\nmust be executed in a particular order, without omissions,\npre-loading provides an opportunity to confirm full\nreceipt, and correct any reception errors (e.g. dropped\ncommands) before time of execution. It also ensures the\ncorrect order of execution.\n\n20.1.2.5 File-Based Operations\nThe preceding description of spacecraft commanding and\nmonitoring is based on the use of application-specific data\npackets, exchanged in \u2018flows\u2019 (akin to Internet packet pro-\ntocols). Such packets can be regarded as a specialized case\nof the more traditional computer file.\n\nIf appropriately designed, a spacecraft may be controlled\nentirely by the exchange of conventional computer files.\nThe transfer of such files may then be handled using stan-\ndard file handling protocols. The spacecraft may be treated\nas (very) remote network attached storage, just as a net-\nworked drive in a typical office IT system. The MCS and the\nspacecraft communicate by the exchange of files over the\nnetwork.\n\nAmong the advantages of such an approach is the\nimproved ability to take advantage of \u2018standard\u2019 commer-\ncial IT solutions and technologies, e.g. encryption software,\ndata compression tools, common encoding languages (such\nas XML), etc.\n\nThe use of file-based spacecraft control is well-suited to\nmissions where contact with the spacecraft is intermittent\nand \u2018live\u2019 monitoring is either not necessary or not prac-\ntical. It is therefore a suitable choice for both low Earth\norbit missions (where contact is intermittent and brief) and\n\nfor interplanetary missions, where the operator needs to\nensure that command stack transfer is complete, error free,\nand correctly sequenced before execution. For cases where\nfrequent telemetry update is required over long periods, the\noverheads of file-based transfer may be less efficient than a\ndedicated packet-based approach.\n\n20.1.3 Mission Planning Systems\n\nOperations planning tools facilitate error free, efficient\noperation of both the spacecraft and its payload.\n\nPlanning tools must be configured (or developed) spe-\ncifically for each mission, taking account of each mission\u2019s\nspecific constraints and the characteristics of the ground\nsegment, spacecraft, orbit, and payload.\n\nPayload planning tools assist in the scheduling and def-\ninition of payload activities, e.g.\n\u2022 By determining the required spacecraft attitude (orienta-\n\ntion) for imaging of an area on the ground, from a given\norbital position.\n\n\u2022 By optimizing a number of imaging requests to achieve\nthe most efficient execution order.\n\n\u2022 By generating (or selecting) command sequences that\nwill be used to execute a payload-related operation,\nincluding determination of parameters to load within\nthose commands (e.g. pointing angles, image exposure\ntimes, etc.).\nOther desirable characteristics in a payload or platform\n\noperations planning tool include\n\u2022 Encapsulation of operational concept rules and ser-\n\nvice level agreements\u2014This includes, for example,\nensuring that all time-tagged commands are uplinked a\nnumber of contacts (or orbits) ahead of their execu-\ntion, which constrains contact planning to only those\nperiods when a ground station service is known to be\noffered.\n\n\u2022 Conflict detection (and resolution)\u2014Identifying conflicts\nbetween requested actions and the state of the system. For\nexample, request for commanding when no ground sta-\ntion (or link) is available; request for uplink or downlink\nduring a contact that is too short to transfer all packets;\nand request for conflicting attitude changes for observa-\ntions by different instruments.\n\n\u2022 Resource modeling\u2014Prediction (modeling) of constrained\nresources, to ensure capacity to support operational\nrequests. For example, effects on power demand and bat-\ntery charge state caused by switching of equipment.\n\n\u2022 Translation of high level requests\u2014Generating low level\ncommand sequences, conforming to the spacecraft data-\nbase, from high level operational requests, e.g. \u2018Acquire\nimage of target at location [x, y]\u2019.\n\n20 Ground Segment 581\n\n\n\n20.1.4 Flight Dynamics\n\nFlight dynamics is the term commonly used to refer to the\ndiscipline and function of the ground segment element ded-\nicated to satellite trajectory and attitude prediction. A\nmathematical treatment of the flight dynamics domain is not\npractical within this chapter. Nevertheless, its importance to\nspacecraft operations as a discipline cannot be overestimated.\n\nOperational activities requiring input from the flight\ndynamics function include\n\u2022 Determination of spacecraft inertial and performance\n\ncharacteristics\u2014e.g. mass, center of mass, moment of\ninertia, drag coefficient and actuator outputs and (mis-\n)alignment vectors (for example, reaction wheel align-\nment and torque generated).\n\n\u2022 Determination of current orbit parameters, based on\nobservations and/or measurements taken by on-board\nsensors and ground-based systems.\n\n\u2022 Planning of orbit maneuvers\u2014e.g. required thrust vector\n(direction and magnitude/duration) for orbit change.\n\n\u2022 Planning of attitude (orientation) maneuvers\u2014e.g. required\nthrust vector (direction and magnitude/duration) for rota-\ntion, and determination of any secondary effects on the orbit.\n\n\u2022 Prediction of significant geometrically related events\u2014\ne.g. acquisition/loss of signal (AOS/LOS) between a\nground station and the spacecraft; conjunction of Sun-\nspacecraft-ground station line (risking heat damage to a\ntracking antenna); spacecraft entry/exit from eclipse.\n\n\u2022 Guidance of tracking systems\u2014e.g. ground station\ntracking of the spacecraft during a pass; tracking of\nsteerable antenna on spacecraft.\n\n\u2022 Generation of orbital files, used as input to the mission\nplanning system (orbit event files) and ground stations\n(STDMs).\nClose interaction is necessary between the spacecraft\n\noperations team and the flight dynamics function (where\nseparate). The planning of a maneuver is not a purely\nmathematical exercise, and involves engineering choices.\nFor example, consider a maneuver to rotate the spacecraft.\nIn three-dimensional space, the operator has a choice of\n\u2022 Rotation axis\u2014Some rotation paths may result in optical\n\nsensors being blinded by bright sources such as the Sun,\nin loss of sunlight on the solar arrays, or in the inability of\na steerable dish to remain locked on target.\n\n\u2022 Rotation rate\u2014A faster maneuver requires greater per-\nformance from actuators and risks causing damage to\nweak or flexible appendages (e.g. solar arrays).\n\n\u2022 Timing\u2014A maneuver may place the spacecraft at risk\nand so should be performed at a moment when other risk\nfactors are low (e.g. out of eclipse, or while in contact\nwith the ground).. A range of such considerations will\napply to any given maneuver.\n\nFlight dynamics is a broad and detailed topic, and the\nsubject of many dedicated books and papers. The following\nsection provides only an overview of the basic techniques\nemployed for determining the location and velocity of a\nspacecraft.\n\n20.1.4.1 Orbit Determination\nOrbit determination describes the process whereby space-\ncraft tracking data is obtained and used to model the orbit of\nthe spacecraft. Once this orbit information is obtained, it\ncan be used for the following\n\u2022 Orbit propagation\u2014i.e. prediction of the future location\n\nof the spacecraft at a given time.\n\u2022 Maneuver planning\u2014i.e. determination of the required\n\nthrust vector to achieve a new orbit.\n\u2022 Spacecraft attitude re-pointing/biasing and recovery\u2014\n\ni.e. to provide the spacecraft with a (time-evolving)\nvector for alignment to the Earth (or other body).\n\n\u2022 Events prediction\u2014i.e. for prediction of eclipses, sensor\nblinding, contact periods, etc.In many modern spacecraft\n[particularly in low Earth orbit (LEO)], orbit determina-\ntion is greatly simplified by the use of an on-board Global\nNavigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)\u2014such as GPS.\nIn cases where GNSS is not (or cannot be) used, orbit\n\ndetermination is achieved by statistical analysis of tracking\ndata from ground stations. This applies to high Earth orbits,\nand to spacecraft traveling far from Earth. Tracking data\nmay include ranging measurements (distance to target)\nrange rate (velocity along line of sight), and bearing mea-\nsurements (direction to target).\n\nThe distance to the spacecraft is measured by accurate\ntiming of radio signals traveling between the spacecraft and\nthe ground station. Two-way ranging is the most common\ntechnique. A continuous, modulated signal is transmitted to\nthe spacecraft. The spacecraft sends a return signal, with a\nfixed phase relationship (and frequency offset) to the\nincoming signal. The ground systems measure the time\ntaken for a signal to travel to, and back from, the spacecraft.\nThis time can be multiplied by the speed of light to provide\nthe distance to the spacecraft. Highly accurate measure-\nments of range can be achieved, even over vast distances.\nAccuracy is tightly coupled to the precision of the timing\nequipment used to measure the signal flight time. Atomic\nclocks permit timing measurement in the nanosecond range,\nequivalent to meter or submeter accuracy.\n\nInstantaneous velocity can be determined from the mea-\nsurement of signal Doppler shift. The Doppler effect creates a\nchange in received radio signal frequency as a result of\nvelocity along the line of signal propagation. The precision of\nrange-rate measurements is principally governed by the\nprecision with which small changes in signal frequency can\nbe measured, and is not greatly affected by distance to the\n\n582 R. Lowe et al.\n\n\n\ntarget. Here, as with range measurement, use of highly\naccurate and stable atomic frequency sources is key.\n\nThe preceding two measurements, when made from a\nsingle ground station, give no information about the direc-\ntion from the station to the spacecraft (only distance, and\nrate of change of distance). Direction can be established in\none of three ways\n\u2022 Directional reception\u2014A large radio antenna (e.g. several\n\nmeters) is most sensitive to incoming signals over a narrow\nangular range (small fraction of a degree). The primary\nangular range of sensitivity, or beam width, is a function of\nthe antenna diameter and the frequency of the radio signal.\nDirection to the target can be deduced based upon signal\nstrength within the antenna\u2019s beam. For optical techniques,\nthe principle is the same but can be thought of more\nintuitively in terms of the imaging resolution and angular\nmagnification of a telescope. While angular resolution\ndoes not vary over distance, the absolute positional accu-\nracy that it translates to does. The further a target is from\nthe detector, the less accurately its position is known. For a\nspacecraft at a distance of 1 Astronomical Unit (au), the\napproximate distance from the Earth to the Sun, 1 arc-\nsecond of angular uncertainty translates into a positional\nuncertainty of over 2 million kilometers. For this reason,\ndirection finding based on simple beam width is only\npractical for spacecraft close to Earth.\n\n\u2022 Triangulation\u2014Combining multiple range measurements\ntaken from different locations (or at different times) can\nallow more accurate direction finding. A technique\nknown as tristation ranging combines measurements of\nrange from three stations, each at an accurately known\nlocation. Triangulation, based on the targets measured\ndistance from each station, permits its position to be\nestablished with considerable accuracy in three dimen-\nsions. For the best results, the angular separation of the\nstations, viewed from the target, must be large. Accuracy\nis therefore a function of angular separation, precision of\nrange measurement, and positional knowledge of the\nstations themselves.\n\n\u2022 (Very) Long Baseline Interferometry\u2014As for triangula-\ntion, interferometry relies upon the use of two (or more)\nstations with a significant angular separation, as viewed\nfrom the target. The same signal from the spacecraft is\nreceived by both stations. The difference in the arrival\ntimes at the two stations is accurately measured and is\ndirectly related to the angle between the target and the\nbaseline formed by the two stations. This technique is a\nkey part of the process known as delta differential one-\nway ranging (D-DOR). As in the case of range and range\nrate measurements, its precision is tightly coupled to\ntiming measurement and it benefits from the use of\natomic timing standards. D-DOR is a key technique for\nspacecraft tracking in deep space missions.\n\n20.1.5 Simulators\n\nDevelopment of the mission simulator is a crucial part of\npreparation for any space mission, particularly scientific\nmissions for which orbits, operational activities, and\nequipment may be unlike those designed for earlier\nspacecraft.\n\n20.1.5.1 Aim of the Mission Operations Simulator\nThe mission operations simulator is designed to replicate\nthe actions and reactions of the real spacecraft, when in\nspace. It will be used by the spacecraft operations team,\nboth to develop procedures and to practice them.2 The\nmission operations simulator may greatly simplify a range\nof physical characteristics (e.g. thermal behavior), where\nthese are not critical to its use in training, procedure vali-\ndation and ground system testing. Other physical charac-\nteristics such as rotational dynamics may need to be\naccurately modeled.\n\nThe mission operations simulator connects to the mission\ncontrol system, and allows the operator to inject spacecraft\ncommands and receive telemetry reports as if communi-\ncating with the real spacecraft, in real time. It fulfills a\nsimilar role to that of a flight simulator for airline pilots. In\nmany cases, mission simulators are designed to enable the\nreal spacecraft\u2019s flight software to operate within the sim-\nulator, running on an emulated SCU processor. The simu-\nlator creates a \u2018virtual\u2019 environment, in which the real\nspacecraft\u2019s control software can execute, as if it was\ndriving the real spacecraft. In fact, it is operating within a\nsimulated SCU, within a simulated spacecraft. Thus, the\nsimulator must be capable of fooling not just the operators\nbut also the spacecraft\u2019s flight software.\n\n20.1.5.2 What Does the Mission Simulator Do?\nAn overview of the architecture for a mission simulator is\ngiven in Fig. 20.1.\n\nMCS is connected to a simulated ground station. This\nmodel receives telecommand packets from the MCS and\npasses them on to the spacecraft simulator, often via a time\ndelay loop, which simulates the radio signal\u2019s propagation\ndelay (which is operationally significant in deep space\nmissions). Telemetry returning from the spacecraft simu-\nlator will be handled in a similar way. It is passed back to\nthe MCS in the form of data received from a real ground\nstation. There is relatively little physical modeling involved\nwithin the ground station model\u2014it simply provides the\n\n2 A range of other simulators will also be used in the mission\ndevelopment as a whole, focusing on other aspects. For example, the\nspacecraft manufacturer will employ simulation for structural engi-\nneering and dedicated dynamic simulations may be used to validate the\non-board software\u2019s attitude control algorithms.\n\n20 Ground Segment 583\n\n\n\nconduit for data traveling to and from the spacecraft. The\nspacecraft simulator contains models for both internal\nsubsystems and the physical world in which the spacecraft\nexists. Orbit propagation and communication signal char-\nacteristics are both affected by the environment model. The\ninternal modeling of the spacecraft can be seen as being\ndivided into two major areas\u2014modeling of the SCU, with\nits associated flight software, and modeling of the space-\ncraft\u2019s actuators, sensors and related hardware. At the heart\nof the SCU model is the actual flight software of the real\nspacecraft. In large part, the remaining models exist simply\nto satisfy the flight software that it is executing within the\nreal spacecraft. The operators, who can only monitor the\nspacecraft through telemetry packets, base their interpreta-\ntion of the spacecraft\u2019s state almost entirely on the flight\nsoftware\u2019s outputs.\n\n20.1.5.3 Modeling Fidelity\nThe simulator\u2019s training value lies not in flawless physical\nprediction, but in perceived realism and the encouragement\nof operator patterns of behavior. In many cases, accurate\nmodeling is a requirement\u2014particularly in relation to atti-\ntude control equipment and data handling; however, the\ndeveloper must always keep the goal of the exercise in\nmind. Too little fidelity and the simulator may encourage\nbad practice; too much fidelity and cost, and performance\nand schedules will suffer. The simulator will ordinarily be\ndesigned to allow the operations team to validate and\npractice operations procedures, ranging from first com-\nmanding after launcher release, through to the final opera-\ntional configuration of the spacecraft. In order to achieve\nthis, it is necessary for the simulator to reproduce the\nbehavior of almost every on-board system to some degree.\n\nFor example, the subsystems that must be \u2018accurately\u2019\nsimulated include\n\u2022 Actuator outputs\u2014forces, torques, relay positions, etc.\n\u2022 Sensor outputs\u2014voltages, temperatures, rotation rates,\n\netc.\n\u2022 Spacecraft dynamics\u2014attitude control.\n\u2022 The visible environment\u2014Sun, Earth, etc.\n\u2022 Electrical power subsystem (EPS) hardware configura-\n\ntion\u2014switch states, battery charge level, power genera-\ntion rate, etc.\n\n\u2022 On-board data handling (OBDH) equipment\u2014TM/TC\ndata formats, remote interfaces, etc.\n\n\u2022 SCU\n\u2022 On-board flight software.\n\nOther systems that may be simulated, with lower fidelity\ninclude\n\u2022 Thermal behavior\n\u2022 Payload operations (some missions may require higher\n\nfidelity than others)\n\u2022 Physical modeling of power generation\u2014e.g. from solar\n\ncells.Inclusion of the real spacecraft\u2019s OBSW within a\nsimulated processor may provide the basis for an objec-\ntive decision on the meaning of \u2018accurate\u2019 modeling. All\nsubsystem modeling must be sufficiently detailed that it\nfools the OBSW into believing that it is operating within\nthe real spacecraft.\nIn general, this leads to very precise requirements on the\n\nformat of data passed between the simulated SCU and both\nthe ground and the spacecraft\u2019s modeled subsystems, i.e. the\npacket standards must be rigorously adhered to.\n\nAnother domain in which accuracy becomes critical is in\nthe response of modeled attitude control equipment. The\nOBSW is constantly looking for any sign that equipment\n\nMission Simulator\n\nMission Control\nSystem\n\nGround Station\nSimulator\n\nE\nnv\n\niro\nnm\n\nen\ntM\n\nod\nel\n\ns\n\nSpacecraft\nModel\n\nSpacecraft Computer Model\n\nFlight Software\n\nAOCS Models\n\nOBDH Models\n\nThermal Models\n\nPower Models\n\nPayload Models\n\nTT&C Models\n\nTM\n\nTC\n\nT\nMT\nC\n\nFig. 20.1 Mission simulator\narchitecture overview\n\n584 R.

This may extend to the modeling of characteristic\nnoise on sensor readouts, if the OBSW expects (or requires)\nthat noise to be evident in the units data outputs.\n\n20.1.5.4 Simulation Campaign\nFollowing the routine use of the mission simulator during\nthe operations development period prior to launch, a sim-\nulation campaign or launch rehearsal will often be con-\nducted in the immediate run-up to launch of the spacecraft.\n\nThis should be performed under as realistic a set of\nconditions as possible, using all relevant operations staff in\ntheir respective roles. A typical simulation campaign will\nproceed in three phases, managed by a training or simula-\ntions officer\n\u2022 Nominal flight procedures will be run from the point of\n\nlauncher separation up until the commissioning stage.\n\u2022 Procedures will be repeated with various failures/anom-\n\nalies injected into the simulator such that contingency\nprocedures and fault diagnosis/analysis can be practiced.\nThe nature of the failure may be known only to the\nsimulations officer prior to the exercise, in order to create\na realistic training environment. Such failure scenarios\nare valuable for both technical and human reasons.\n\n\u2022 Immediately prior to launch, the simulations officer may\nthen revert to a fully nominal scenario, a dress rehearsal,\nin order to settle nerves and give confidence to the team.\n\n20.1.5.5 Practical Benefits of Mission Simulators\nThe mission operations simulator adds value to mission\npreparations in a number of ways, e.g.\n\u2022 Assists the operator in gaining familiarity with the mis-\n\nsion control system\u2014By providing feedback to operator\nactions, the simulator gives the operator a more complete\ninteraction with the mission control system.\n\n\u2022 Assists the operator in gaining familiarity with spacecraft\non-board systems\u2014The nature of spacecraft operations\nmeans that the spacecraft \u2018lives in the operator\u2019s head\u2019. A\nfirm mental conception of each subsystem is vital, since\nthere is no physical contact with the object that the\noperator is controlling.\n\n\u2022 Enables validation of operational procedures, prior to\nlaunch or other critical mission phases\u2014Every proce-\ndure that is developed for controlling the spacecraft must\nbe tested using the simulator before it is used on the real\nspacecraft. Testing is vitally important, to ensure that\nnothing has been overlooked during preparation. Proce-\ndural faults may physically damage the spacecraft or lead\nto other indirect and unforeseen consequences.\n\n\u2022 Supports interface testing of the ground network and\ncontrol systems\u2014The simulator provides a source of\ntelemetry packets and a sink for telecommands. It can be\n\nused to test the complete chain of processing equipment\nin the ground segment, to ensure that each component is\ncapable of communicating with the next.\n\n\u2022 Supports performance testing of the ground network and\ncontrol systems\u2014By producing representative volumes\nand types of data, the simulator can exercise the ground\nsegment equipment, ensuring that each component pro-\ncesses data correctly, and in a timely manner.\n\n\u2022 Enables validation of the spacecraft\u2019s on-board soft-\nware\u2014Executing the real OBSW within the simulator\ncan provide useful feedback on the behavior of the\nOBSW in a wide range of operational situations. During\nthe development of the spacecraft, the simulator can (and\noften does) highlight unwanted OBSW features that have\nnot yet been detected on the real equipment.\n\n\u2022 Provides cross-checking of design assumptions and\nbehaviors\u2014Both the OBSW developers and the simula-\ntor developers must make assumptions about the design\nof the spacecraft hardware and its software. By working\nindependently, the two teams can provide a cross-check\non each other\u2019s work\u2014any discrepancies between the\nOBSW\u2019s behavior and the simulator\u2019s models should be\nchecked. The error could be in either one.\n\n\u2022 Supports training rehearsals for all phases of spacecraft\noperation\u2014The simulator is used by the operations team\nto practice each major mission phase, many times over\nbefore the real event.\n\n\u2022 Assists in team-building amongst the operations staff\u2014\nPracticing operations leads not only to the development\nof technical knowledge but also to a better-integrated\nteam. Each participant learns how to work with the rest of\nthe group in order to achieve maximum efficiency.\n\n\u2022 Trains the operations team to cope with in-flight failure\nscenarios, both technically and psychologically\u2014The\nsimulator allows faulty hardware to be simulated, and\noperators to practice recovery techniques. The operator\nmust learn not only the correct technical solution to a\nproblem, but also the correct mental approach to dealing\nwith a potentially stressful, time pressured situation.\n\n\u2022 Develops a wider pool of experts, familiar with the mis-\nsion and equipment\u2014Development of the simulator\nspreads knowledge of the mission design and features.\nGiven the extremely specialized nature of spacecraft\noperations, such knowledge transfer can be important for\nthe ongoing success of mission control.\n\n20.1.5.6 Ground Segment Test, Verification\nand Validation\n\nBeyond operations preparation and training, simulation\ntools also play a role in the validation of the ground segment\nitself.\n\nSimulation tools may be used as sources or sinks of data\nflow, with great flexibility. In particular, when integrating a\n\n20 Ground Segment 585\n\n\n\nlarge \u2018system of systems\u2019, the use of simulation-based\nintegration and verification (I&V) systems can support or\nenable\n\u2022 Stress testing (i.e. testing the system under maximum\n\nload conditions\u2014and beyond)\n\u2022 Testing prior to system completion (i.e. by using simu-\n\nlated components in lieu of real ones)\n\u2022 Fault testing (i.e. by injection controlled error conditions\n\ninto the system through the simulator)\n\u2022 Diagnostic and exploratory testing\n\u2022 Record keeping for system qualification purposes\n\u2022 Test case design and configuration control\n\u2022 System state visualization.\n\n20.1.6 Link Security\n\nThis section identifies a number of technologies used for\nprotecting the data link. Erroneous or false signals may be\nreceived as a result of either \u2018natural\u2019 signal noise or\nintentional interference.\n\nWhile most (if not all) missions will incorporate some\nmeasure of protection against \u2018natural\u2019 signal corruption,\nmore advanced techniques for protection against malicious\nattack are normally applied only to commercial or defense-\nrelated missions, and not to scientific missions.\n\n20.1.6.1 Error Correction\nWhen transmitting binary data, signal noise can result in\nerroneous reception of the data at the receiving end. The\nsimplest case is that of a binary \u20181\u2019 being received as a \u20180\u2019,\nor vice versa. The likelihood of such an event increases as\nthe signal gets weaker (e.g. as the spacecraft gets farther\nfrom Earth).\n\nForward error correction (FEC) is a common technique\nemployed to minimize this problem. A detailed treatment of\nFEC is beyond the scope of this chapter, but the principles\nupon which it operates can be easily understood. At its most\nbasic, FEC places additional content in the transmitted data\nto allow transmission errors to be detected and, to a limited\ndegree, to be corrected without the need for retransmission.\n\nConsider an approach which simply duplicates all\ninformation transmitted (i.e. the data is transmitted twice).\nIf a random error occurs in reception, the two copies of the\ndata will differ. The receiver can therefore detect the\nerror\u2014though it cannot determine which copy is incorrect.\n\nTransmitting the same signal three times would allow\nboth detection and correction to take place because there is\na low probability of the same random error appearing in\nmore than one transmission; hence a majority vote (best of\n3) can be applied for each data bit.\n\nIn practice, FEC is usually performed using more efficient\ntechniques than simple duplication. Nevertheless, some\n\nmeasure of signal redundancy is always present, reducing the\nuseable bandwidth on the link. An example of more advanced\nFEC applied to space data links is Reed-Solomon encoding\nor Turbo Code, as discussed briefly in Chap. 15.\n\nFurther checks can then be performed after decoding to\nensure that the data is format-valid, consistent (with itself\nand/or other data sources), and reasonable (e.g. within an\nexpected range).\n\n20.1.6.2 Encryption\nData encryption is an obvious method for protecting both\nthe command and telemetry links. In the space context,\nthere are some specific issues to address when implement-\ning encryption.\n\nEncryption can add significant volume to the data being\ntransmitted.3 For missions where link data rates are very\nlow, a suitable algorithm should be chosen which minimises\nthis overhead\u2014or alternatively encryption may be entirely\nomitted.\n\nIn the event that a traffic encryption key (TEK) is\ncompromised (no longer secret), it is necessary to replace it\nwith a new private key; i.e. re-keying. This can present a\nproblem for spacecraft since the new key may have to be\ndelivered over the command data link\u2014which is now\nunsafe. The uploading of new TEKs to the spacecraft may\nbe performed using a second level of keys, which are used\nonly for protection of TEKs themselves. These secondary\nkeys may be referred to as key encryption keys (KEK). This\napproach relies upon the pre-loading of KEKs to the\nspacecraft in advance of launch. Only in the event of a TEK\nchange is a KEK required, and the KEK is not required to\nbe transmitted over the data link. This model, based on\nhigher levels of keys for the encryption of lower level keys,\ncan be continued in order to facilitate over-the-air transfer\nof KEKs themselves, using \u2018master\u2019 key encryption keys.\n\n20.1.6.3 Authentication\nIn some circumstances, the content of a data link does not\nneed to be concealed but must still be delivered in a way\nthat allows the receiver to have confidence that the data is\ngenuine. For example, the delivery of public broadcast data\nused for safety services must be widely accessible, but\nguarded against introduction of erroneous data from a non-\nlegitimate source (e.g. signal \u2018spoofing\u2019).\n\nThis can be achieved by appending the data with a digital\nauthentication stamp, which is the output of a keyed cryp-\ntographic hash function. The value encoded in this addi-\ntional data field is tightly coupled to the content of the main\nmessage, and to a secret key. The receiver of the data may\n\n3 It is common practice to generate \u2018dummy\u2019 data for insertion in\nencrypted data flows, in order to conceal the presence (or absence) of\ntrue data.\n\n586 R. Lowe et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_15\n\n\nthen validate the message by checking, mathematically, that\nthe authentication stamp is consistent with the data to which\nit is attached. Only a genuine message, authenticated by the\ncorrect algorithm, using the correct key, will pass the test.\n\n20.1.6.4 Transmission Security\nAs an alternative, or an addition, to protection of the\nencoded data, the manner of transmission may also be used\nto protect the data link. Pseudo-random frequency hopping\nis an example of such a technique. The frequency upon\nwhich the data is encoded is rapidly changed (perhaps many\ntimes per second), according to a pseudo-random sequence.\nThe sequence is the result of a key-based process. To an\noutside observer, not in possession of the key, the sequence\nwill appear genuinely random, preventing reception of the\nsignal as it jumps from one carrier frequency to another. In\nfact, the sequence is wholly predictable but only to those in\npossession of the key.\n\n20.2 Payload Data Ground Segment (and\nUser Segment)\n\nThe payload data ground segment (PDGS) is primarily\nresponsible for receiving the science data from the satellite\n(where applicable), applying the appropriate processing\nalgorithms, and delivering it to the users. Note that the\nconcept of a PDGS relates in particular to observational and\nscientific satellites, where measurement data is generated by\nthe satellite and must be processed before dissemination to a\nuser community.\n\n20.2.1 Common Payload Data Ground\nSegment Terms\n\n20.2.1.1 Product Levels\nIn order to be of practical use to the users, the data received\nfrom a satellite must undergo processing by the ground\nsegment. There are a number of defined levels that make up\na hierarchical data product scheme.\n\nThe data received directly from the satellite is termed\n\u2018raw data\u2019. This is not yet considered to be a data product.\nThe data is reformatted and time ordered, to form the basic\n\u2018Level 0\u2019 data. Level 0 (L0) data is not typically made\navailable to users.\n\nLevel 1 (L1) data are engineering products where the\ndata has been converted to engineering units, auxiliary data\n(e.g. instrument configuration or status information) has\nbeen separated from measurements, and selected calibra-\ntions have been applied to the data. These products are the\nfoundation from which higher level products are derived.\nFor example, Level 1 radar data may show signal strength\n\nreflected from each point in the imaged area, and variation\nin surface shape. Increasing degrees of processing may be\nindicated by sublevels (e.g. Level 1A, 1B, etc.).\n\nLevel 2 (L2) data products are typically the same reso-\nlution as the preceding L1 data but with further information\nderived, typically relating to geophysical properties. For\nexample, Level 2 radar data may allow ocean wind speed to\nbe determined based upon the detected wave structure.\nLevel 2 is the most common data product level ordered and\nused by users, who may proceed to generate further, even\nhigher level data products.\n\nFor some missions, further levels of processing are\ndefined indicating additional levels of information deriva-\ntion from the underlying source data (e.g. Level 3, Level 4).\nThe precise meaning of these terms is dependent upon the\nmission in question.\n\n20.2.1.2 Auxiliary Data Files\nAuxiliary data files are required by the processors within the\nPDGS to provide the additional supplementary data needed\nto generate the higher level products (Levels 1 and above).\nADFs may be produced by other elements of the ground\nsegment (e.g. attitude steering files, predicted orbit files\ngenerated by the flight operations system, etc.), by infor-\nmation generated on-board the satellite (e.g. calibration data\nnot part of the main measurement), or by completely sep-\narate bodies (e.g. digital elevation maps, biome maps, other\ngeophysical information etc.). Any data needed to process\nthe higher level products that aren\u2019t direct measurements of\nthe instrument are classified as auxiliary data. The PDGS\nmust establish an interface with the necessary ADF pro-\nviders in order to complete the processing chain(s).\n\n20.2.2 PDGS Architecture\n\nThis section describes the typical architecture of a PDGS\nfor an Earth observation system, as shown in Fig. 20.2.\n\nThe output data products of the PDGS are provided to\nthe user segment, for onward distribution to the user\ncommunity.\n\n20.2.2.1 Data Acquisition and Ingestion Function\nThe purpose of the acquisition and ingestion function is to\nmanage the reception of payload data from the satellite and\nprocess the received data stream into Level 0 (L0) products.\n\nThe acquisition sub-function includes the antenna and\nRF systems that directly receive the downlinked telemetry\nfrom the satellite. Instrument source packets (ISP) are\ngenerated for onward transmission to the L0 processor.\n\nThe operations carried out by the acquisition and\ningestion function are typically located within the ground\nstations. The processing, archiving and dissemination\n\n20 Ground Segment 587\n\n\n\nfunctions (see later) do not have to be co-located with the\nacquisition and ingestion function, and may be geographi-\ncally dispersed across a number of sites.\n\n20.2.2.2 Processing Function\nThe L0 processor generates the L0 data from the ISPs\nproduced by the front-end processor. For generation, the L0\nproducts also require certain ADFs made available by the\nauxiliary data providers.\n\nThe L0 data may then be checked for consistency, and\nany applicable metadata generated and/or extracted. The\ndata, including metadata, is then distributed to the archiving\nand higher-level processing functions.\n\nThe processing function is responsible for processing L0\ndata up to higher level products. There are two types of\nprocessing chain, on-line and off-line; the on-line chain\nsystematically generates the higher level data from the L0\ndata received from the acquisition and Ingestion function,\nwhile the off-line chain is triggered by specific processing\nrequests and receives the L0 data from the archive.\n\n20.2.2.3 Archiving Function\nThe archiving function receives the L0 products from the\nacquisition and ingestion function and archives them in a\n\nlong-term archive. Archiving strategies for higher levels\ndiffer from mission to mission depending upon cost and user\nrequirements, but a common approach is to archive all\nhigher level data (L1 and above) generated by the PDGS\n(preventing the need to regenerate it from the lower level\ndata at a later time). The function also catalogs all of the\ndata it receives.\n\nThe archiving function may be responsible for process-\ning retrieval requests from the user segment, called pro-\nduction orders, for organizing the incoming requests in\nterms of product type and output media and for scheduling\nthe retrieval of data from the archive for the dissemination\nfunction.\n\n20.2.2.4 Dissemination Function\nThe dissemination and distribution function is responsible\nfor relaying data products to the users following a produc-\ntion order received from the user segment. This production\norder could take the form of retrieval of archive products, a\nstanding order, or a request for recent acquisitions. This\nfunction is responsible for processing a production order,\nretrieving the ordered products and making them available\nvia electronic means (or where relevant, write them to\nmedia) and distributing them to the user.\n\nSpace Segment\n\nExternal Science\nData Processing\n\nFacilities\n\nInstrument Payload Data\n\nFlight Operations\nSegment\n\nMission Planning\nData\n\nUser Segment\n\nUsers\n\nResponses\n\nAuxiliary\nData Files\n\n(ADFs)\n\nExternal Validation\nSources\n\nGround\nCalibration\nEquipment\n\nInstrument\nProvider\n\nValidation Data\n\n Calibration Planning /\n Calibration Data\n\nInstrument Data\n\nProduct Orders\n\n Instrument Control Files /\n Instrument Monitoring Data\n\nPDGS\n\nData Products\n\nUser Queries\n\nMission\nManagement\n\nCal/Val\n\nQC\n\nMission Planning Ingestion\n\nAcquisition Archive\n\nProcessing Dissemination\n\nMonitoring\n\nControl\n\nHK TM\nFig. 20.2 Payload data ground\nsegment architecture\n\n588 R. Lowe et al.\n\n\n\n20.2.2.5 Mission Planning Function\nThe PDGS planning component is responsible for the\ngeneration of the payload plan to be sent to the flight\noperations segment. This plan focuses on the scheduling of\npayload activities (e.g. observations or measurements to be\nperformed), and may imply actions for the wider spacecraft\n(e.g. re-pointing to align on an imaging target). Planning is\nan iterative process between the FOS and the PDGS, as each\nhas an impact on the other. It is normal for the FOS to\nprovide an initial skeleton plan identifying \u2018hard\u2019 planning\nrequirements such as ground station pass availability,\nrequired maneuver periods, etc. Payload planning is then\nincluded, and a \u2018deconfliction\u2019 process then ensues, itera-\ntively, between the FOS and the PDGS planning functions.\n\nThe mission planning system includes the following\nmain functionalities\n\u2022 Generation and visualization of the payload and down-\n\nlink plan to be sent to the flight operations segment\n(FOS)\u2014These plans are derived from a set of configu-\nration files defining mission objectives: areas of interest,\ndates, and periodicity of the coverage, instrument modes,\ndownlink stations, recorder properties, etc., that the\nmission plan must take account of in order to perform the\nplanning activities. These plans may be updated follow-\ning the receipt of special calibration or observation\nrequests or an identified need for unplanned spacecraft\nmaneuvers.\n\n\u2022 Generation and visualization of the acquisition plan for\nthe stations\u2014These plans accommodate the planned\ndownlink operations to be sent to the acquisition stations.\nNote that ground stations used by the FOS and the PDGS\nfor data downlink may not be the same.\n\n\u2022 The archiving and configuration control of the mission\nconfiguration files and all exchanged data.\n\n\u2022 Management of the PDGS and FOS interfaces.\n\u2022 The mission planning function centralizes the exchange\n\nof information between the FOS and the complete PDGS.\nIt may also receive the updates to instrument and pro-\ncessing parameters from the PDGS calibration facility\nand forward them accordingly to the FOS and to the\nPDGS processing facilities.\n\n20.2.2.6 Quality Control and Calibration Function\nThe quality control (QC) and calibration functions are\nresponsible for ensuring that the data products generated by\nthe mission and distributed to the users are fit for purpose.\nThis function covers the systematic and offline quality anal-\nysis of data products, the calibration and validation activities\nand the monitoring of the performance of the instrument.\n\nSystematic QC relates to the activities performed on a\nroutine basis on the data products generated by the PDGS,\non either a sample or the complete data set. These can take\nthe form of automated real-time checks within the\n\nprocessing chain to determine whether a product can be sent\nto the final user, or the routine expert analysis of the data set\nto perform mission and product performance analyses.\n\nOffline QC includes the activities of interfacing with the\nuser segment, responding to user queries and identified\nanomalous products, in addition to the production of quality\nreports.\n\nThe calibration and validation sub-function is responsi-\nble for quantitatively defining the system response, both on\na product and instrument level, to known controlled signals,\nand independently assessing the quality of the data products\nproduced by the mission. For Earth observation missions, it\nis also responsible for geophysical validation activities that\nindependently assess the quality of the geophysical infor-\nmation of the science data (i.e. provision of, and comparison\nto \u2018ground truth\u2019 data, resulting from in situ measurements).\n\nInstrument performance monitoring is the sub-function\nresponsible for the monitoring of key instrument perfor-\nmance parameters derived from mission data products, and\nhousekeeping telemetry (HKTM) data from the platform.\n\n20.2.2.7 Monitoring and Control Function\nThe monitoring and control facilities allow the operators to\nview the status of each element and facility within the\nPDGS. Typical capabilities include\n\u2022 Execution control of processes\n\u2022 Status monitoring (including warning and alarm states for\n\nsoftware and hardware)\n\u2022 Monitoring of data processing queues, and intervention\n\ncapability where appropriate.\n\n20.2.3 User Segment\n\nThe user segment is responsible for providing a single\ninterface between the mission and users, for a number of\nservices including data ordering and addressing specific\nproblem requests. No other function within the ground\nsegment should have an interface with the user other than\nthe user segment. The segment typically consists of the\nfollowing sub-functions\n\u2022 The user order handling sub-function handles user orders\n\nand maintains a database of orders and their status. It\nsplits orders according to past (archive retrieval) and\nfuture (acquisition tasking), and tracks the status of\nindividual items. It is this sub-function that generates the\nproduct orders that are sent to the product order handling\nsub-function in the archiving function.\n\n\u2022 The user ordering application is a client side application\nthat accesses the databases of available data products and\nallows users to place orders for specific data products.\n\n\u2022 The user service catalog provides all archived and poten-\ntial products as a hierarchy of collections to be ordered.\n\n20 Ground Segment 589\n\n\n\n\u2022 The user registration and authorization sub-function\nhandles user account details and provides authorization\nfor certain user services, such as product ordering.\n\n\u2022 The user help desk is a first line help desk that directly\ninterfaces with the users on questions and issues with the\ndata or ordering process. It relays any queries that it\ncannot answer to the QC and Cal/Val function of the\nPDGS.\n\n20.3 Mission Operations\n\nThis section describes significant features of each phase of a\nmission, from the perspective of the operations engineer.4 It\nbegins with brief overview of the effects of orbit on com-\nmunications links for a range of orbit types.\n\n20.3.1 Impact of Orbit on Communication\n\nThe orbit into which a spacecraft will be placed has a major\nbearing on the way in which the spacecraft will be operated,\nand the issues that will be faced by the operations team.\nThree major classes orbit are discussed below.\n\u2022 Low Earth orbit (LEO)\u2014These missions are character-\n\nized by brief contact periods with ground stations,5 typ-\nically only a few minutes long. For polar orbits,\nplacement of ground stations at high latitudes is advan-\ntageous because it provides contact up to once per orbit;\nground stations at lower latitudes may be able to make\ncontact only every nth orbit. High-speed communications\nlinks are important to ensure adequate transfer for pay-\nload and platform data. Commanding must be pre-pre-\npared out of contact, for (often automated) uplink during\na narrow command window. Accurate antenna tracking\ninformation must be provided for each pass. In higher\norbits (e.g. medium Earth orbit), similar features are\npresent but less extreme. Contact periods are longer, and\nuse of multiple ground stations for (near) permanent\ncontact becomes practical.\n\n\u2022 Geostationary missions\u2014The fixed line of sight between\na ground station and a geostationary spacecraft allows\npermanent contact to be maintained from a single site. A\nstatic (non-steerable) antenna may be used. The timing of\noperations activities are largely unconstrained by com-\nmunications considerations, and on-board anomalies can\n\nbe detected (and reacted to) quickly. The availability of a\ncontinuous data link reduces the need for high data rates\non the communications link.\n\n\u2022 Deep space missions\u2014Communications links may be\npermanent or intermittent, depending upon the scale of\nthe ground network deployed. With a small number of\nglobally distributed stations (minimum three), continuity\nof connection is possible, but large dishes are needed for\nlong-range communication. More typically, communica-\ntion is intermittent but with long active passes lasting\nseveral hours. Accurate antenna pointing is required. The\ntime taken for a communications signal to propagate from\nEarth to the spacecraft (or vice versa) can become large\n(this is referred to as one-way light time\u2014OWLT). For\nmissions to the outer planets, this period may be mea-\nsured in hours. Nominal operations and response to on-\nboard anomalies must take account of these long delays,\nusually accompanied by very low data rates on commu-\nnications channels. On-board automation for failure\ndetection, isolation and recovery (FDIR) may be required\nto ensure spacecraft survivability.\n\n20.3.2 Pre-launch Operations\n\nThis section, and those that follow, describe the role of the\noperations team from the earliest phases of the mission\nthrough to routine operations (as well as considerations for\nend-of-life).\n\nThe spacecraft operations team are typically involved in\nreviewing both the design, and the documentation of the\nground segment and spacecraft, to ensure that the resulting\nsystem is both correctly implemented from a functional\nstand point, and useable from an operator\u2019s perspective. The\noperations concept will be specified at an early stage and\nwill be a driver for the design of both the spacecraft and the\nground segment infrastructure. Early in the mission devel-\nopment, the operations team may consist of just one or two\nengineers, supported by ground infrastructure experts.\n\nAt a later stage, the spacecraft database must be\nreviewed and debugged, to ensure completeness and cor-\nrectness. The database will be used as the basis for all\nspacecraft commanding, and as an input to the mission\noperational simulator and planning tools. Since develop-\nment of the simulator in particular must be completed many\nmonths before launch, the spacecraft database must be\nprepared well in advance of this time, as an input to its\ndevelopment.\n\nIt should be noted that the control system and the sim-\nulator will be developed using the same database. This\nimplies that errors in the database itself may not become\napparent, since they will appear in both the simulator and\nthe control system, which will \u2018agree\u2019 on the incorrect\n\n4 For further reading, the reader is recommended to study European\nCooperation for Space Standardisation (ECSS) paper ECSS-E-ST-\n70C, describing ground systems and operations for space systems.\n5 At the time of writing, most LEO missions continue to use direct\nspace-to-ground communications links, rather than relay links via\nother communications satellites.\n\n590 R. Lowe et al.\n\n\n\ndefinition. Nevertheless, the processes of encoding and\ndecoding should have been independently implemented,\nthereby giving confidence in the algorithms of the control\nsystem to encode and decode. Further independence is\nachieved in reviewing the correctness of the database,\nthrough the development of the simulator. The production\nof simulator models requires that the developer pays\ndetailed attention to each item in the database, and runs\noperational simulations in scenarios not yet testable with the\nreal spacecraft. There is an improved likelihood that either\nthe operations team or the simulator development team will\nidentify errors in the database.\n\nOnce the control system is well developed, the by-now\nexpanded operations team will dedicate much effort to\nactivities such as\n\u2022 Writing/reviewing/testing operations procedures (see\n\nSect. 20.1.1)\n\u2022 System verification test (SVT)\n\u2022 Defining mode equations (see Sect. 20.1.2)\n\u2022 Defining derived parameters (see Sect. 20.1.2).SVTs\n\ninvolve connecting the live spacecraft to the ground\ncontrol center, whilst still \u2018on the ground\u2019. This is usually\nachieved using wide area network (in some cases the\nspacecraft may even be in a different country to the\ncontrol center). A complete end-to-end test using spe-\ncially designed procedures is then performed. The ability\nto correctly command the spacecraft using the control\ncenter is exercised, which may expose problems where\nthe simulator inaccurately modeled the spacecraft\u2019s real\nbehavior. There will be certain limits to exactly what\nspacecraft functions can be commanded in these condi-\ntions (thrusters will not be operated inside a clean room,\nfor example). Additional support equipment may be\nneeded to verify operation for some subsystems (e.g. a\ndisplay panel to show which thrusters are being com-\nmanded, without actual operation of the thrusters).\nDuring the final period before launch, operations\n\nrehearsals will be conducted under simulated conditions.\nRefer to Sect. 20.1.5.\n\n20.3.3 Launch and Early Orbit Phase\n\nThe launch and early operations phase (LEOP) refers to the\nfirst days of a mission from launch up until the point when\nthe platform has been established to be in good working\norder. It includes\n\u2022 Preparation for launch\n\u2022 First contact with the spacecraft\n\u2022 Monitoring/performing initialization sequences\n\u2022 Achieving the final operational orbit/trajectory\n\u2022 Performing check-out of platform (sub)systems.\n\n20.3.3.1 Preparation for Launch\nDuring this period, a TM/TC link and power supply is\nmaintained with the spacecraft via an umbilical link, as the\nRF equipment and solar arrays (if applicable) will be\nstowed inside the launcher fairing. Flight software is loaded\nand booted up under ground control and it is usual for\noperations staff to monitor the health of the spacecraft for\nunusual telemetry, particularly with regard to the thermal\ncontrol subsystem and the batteries\u2019 health and state of\ncharge. The umbilical link is removed shortly before\nlaunch.\n\n20.3.3.2 First Contact with the Spacecraft\nThis is the section of a mission immediately following the\nseparation sequence (i.e. release from the launch vehicle)\nand is the point where the operations team will take over\ncontrol of the spacecraft.\n\nDirectly after separation, an initialization sequence will\nbe performed in order to switch on the necessary spacecraft\nsystems for basic operation and initialization of the correct\nsoftware control modes. The most important operations at\nthis stage are to establish a communications link, and to\nensure adequate power supply (e.g. from solar arrays).\nCommonly, essential actions for these tasks will be per-\nformed by an automated on-board software sequence. This\nensures that a delay in establishing a command link (or\ndropout of an established link) does not unduly endanger\nthe spacecraft\u2019s chances in the critical first hours of the\nmission.\n\n20.3.3.3 Monitoring/Performing Initialization\nSequences\n\nOnce a space-to-ground communications link has been\nestablished, operators can then continue with the initiali-\nzation sequence. This can be performed manually by tele-\ncommand, but more commonly it will be performed\nautonomously by software, in which case the operations\nteam will simply monitor telemetry (with specialists dedi-\ncated to each spacecraft subsystem). If problems are\nencountered during the sequence, it will be aborted and a\nbackup plan of contingency procedures adopted to perform\nthe initialization sequence manually, by telecommand.\n\nActions will include the initialization of the reaction\ncontrol system and activation of the relevant attitude sen-\nsors for this stage of the mission. Once this is done, a stable\nattitude (orientation) can be established. In most cases, this\nmeans reaching (and maintaining) an appropriate alignment\nwith respect to the Sun. Spacecraft using deployable solar\narrays as the main electrical power source will perform (at\nleast partial) deployment of the solar arrays at this time.\nOne reason that the arrays may only be partially deployed\n(e.g. outer-most panel sections only, per wing) is that high\n\n20 Ground Segment 591\n\n\n\nthrust/torque maneuvers during final orbit acquisition can\nexert damaging torques on the extended array structure, and\non the solar array drive mechanism at the base of the arrays.\n\n20.3.3.4 Achieving the Final Operational Orbit/\nTrajectory\n\nIf the launcher delivers the spacecraft into a transfer orbit,\nthen it is necessary to acquire the final orbit or trajectory by\na series of maneuvers. This can include orbit raising, orbit\ncircularization, plane changes, longitude drifts, or injecting\nan escape change of velocity, DV; for deep space missions.\n\nSmall thruster burns are used to calibrate the response of\nthe spacecraft\u2019s accelerometers and gyroscopes, before\nundertaking larger orbit changing maneuvers.\n\nDuring this period spacecraft visibility from mission\nground stations will need to be predicted based on the\nmeasured orbit, and TM/TC links will then be maintained\nby switching between the ground stations.\n\nIn the case of geostationary missions, after separation,\nthe spacecraft will usually be in geostationary transfer orbit\n(GTO) or super-synchronous transfer orbit (SSTO), both\nrequiring a series of thruster burns to circularize the orbit at\nthe final height. Before each engine firing, various sensors\nwill be used to accurately acquire the correct spacecraft\nattitude, effectively selecting the direction in which the\nspacecraft will accelerate.\n\nOnce a geostationary orbit is acquired, the required\nlongitude position is achieved through east\u2013west maneu-\nvers. See Sect. 20.3.5.\n\n20.3.3.5 Configuring the Spacecraft\nDuring LEOP, full deployment of the solar arrays will be\nperformed, as well as any antennas/reflectors, etc. This will\nusually involve activating various pyrotechnic devices,\nincluding electro-explosive devices (EED) or pyro bolts,\nwire cutters, (e.g. thermal knives), mechanical release\nmechanisms, winder motors etc. This is a critical period as\nfailures of pyro units can severely (even fatally) affect a\nmission.\n\nIn-orbit testing (IOT) is carried out, characterizing the\nresponses of all the on-board units and identifying any\nfaults or unexpected behaviors. In order to minimize the\namount of unnecessary switching, it is common to initialize\nfirst the redundant (back-up) equipment and, once that\nfunctionality has been established and characterized,\nreconfigure to use the prime (\u2018normal\u2019) equipment.\n\n20.3.4 Commissioning\n\nFor a complex payload, which may consist of hundreds of\nidentical switches and power amps etc., the \u2018switch-on\u2019\nprocess can take many hours or even days.\n\nThe approach to commissioning a given payload will\nstrongly depend upon the nature of the payload. In general,\nthe aim is to confirm that all elements of the payload are\nable to be switched on and that no faults are detectable.\nSince hardware failures often occur at the moment of\npower-up, it is advisable to minimize the number of power\ncycles that any equipment is subject to. For this reason,\ncommissioning tests are sometimes performed on the\n\u2018backup\u2019 hardware (or \u2018B\u2019 units) first, so that it can then be\nswitched off and left off. This avoids the need to take the\nprimary hardware (or \u2018A\u2019 units) through a power-up-down-\nup cycle at the beginning of the mission.\n\nFor most payload types, some kind of calibration activity\nwill be required. Calibration is a process of measuring the\noutputs of the unit against known signals, in order to\ndetermine any offset or bias that is present in the output.\nThis can then be adjusted for, either by tuning the instru-\nment to give the correct output or by changes to the pro-\ncessing of the data at a later stage.\n\nAs an example, the calibration of an Earth observation\nspectrometer payload may require the collection of spec-\ntrum data locally, on the ground, to confirm that the\nspacecraft sensor\u2019s output matches \u2018ground truth\u2019.\n\nThe calibration activity may be repeated throughout the\nlifetime of the mission, if necessary, to ensure that the\ninstrument remains as accurately calibrated as possible.\n\n20.3.5 Routine Operations\n\nThis is the period of the mission that is begun once the\nspacecraft has been commissioned and is performing the\ntasks for which the mission was designed. However, mis-\nsions can vary greatly in purpose and scope and hence the\nterm \u2018routine operations\u2019 can mean different things.\n\n20.3.5.1 Geosynchronous Missions and Station-\nKeeping\n\nGeosynchronous spacecraft orbit the Earth with a period of\n1 sidereal day, and hence their sub-satellite points maintain\nthe same longitude. Geostationary satellites are a subset of\nthese, where the inclination in relation to the equatorial\nplane is also controlled by keeping it at or close to zero.\nThese two terms are often (and erroneously) used\ninterchangeably.\n\nGeosynchronous spacecraft are relatively straightforward\nto operate. Since the spacecraft remains at a fixed (or nearly\nfixed) location in the sky, the task of establishing a TM/TC\nlink is greatly simplified. In this case, it is often possible to\nmaintain near-24-hour communications with the vehicle.\n\nThe network of ground stations can be reduced to a\nsingle site and an essentially fixed antenna. There is no need\nto predict ground passes or to limit operations to a finite\n\n592 R. Lowe et al.\n\n\n\ncommanding window. Nevertheless, geostationary space-\ncraft do drift off-station and require regular orbit mainte-\nnance or \u2018station-keeping\u2019 maneuvers.\n\nDue to the nature of the Earth\u2019s non-spherical gravita-\ntional field, there are stable and unstable locations for\ngeostationary orbits. At a stable node (approximately 75?E\n105?W), orbit correction maneuvers are required only rarely\nevery few months.\n\nIn all other locations, the spacecraft will tend to drift in a\nconsistent direction as time goes by. Since geostationary\nspacecraft are required to remain within a specified \u2018box\u2019,\nthe operations team must periodically correct the orbit.\nOrbital maintenance burns may occur on a weekly basis.\n\nInclination of the orbit will result in a daily sinusoidal\nmotion of the satellite in a north/south direction about the\nequator. The degree of north/south movement is directly\nrelated to the inclination of the orbit.\n\nThe level of inclination that can be tolerated is a mission\ndesign parameter. From an Earth-based observer\u2019s per-\nspective, inclination (when combined with eccentricity) will\nmanifest itself as a \u2018figure eight\u2019, or lemniscate motion of\nthe spacecraft in the sky over the course of a day; see also\nSect. 4.4.3. A large degree of motion may introduce com-\nplications for communications links, both for the spacecraft\nand for communications service users on the ground. The\nmotion may be accommodated by either a wide gain pattern\non the antennas or by steering mechanisms. A tightly\nmaintained inclination (at or close to zero) requires regular\nmaneuvers\u2014e.g. on a fortnightly or monthly basis.\n\nManeuvers are generally split into the following\ncategories\n\u2022 East/west station-keeping maneuver\u2014Trimming of\n\nspacecraft\u2019s longitude.\n\u2022 North/south station-keeping maneuver\u2014Control of\n\ndrifting orbital inclination (only applicable to geosta-\ntionary satellites).\n\n\u2022 Eccentricity correction\u2014Periodic circularization of the\norbit. This is often combined with station-keeping\nmaneuvers.\n\n\u2022 Attitude maneuvers\u2014Dumping excess momentum that\nwas acquired through external sources of torque (e.g.\nsolar pressure, gravitational torque, etc.).Different mis-\nsions apply different philosophies for keeping the\nspacecraft within their assigned \u2018box\u2019. Some spacecraft\nonly perform maneuvers if they are about to move outside\nof a defined dead-band (on the order of 0.1\u20131? wide). The\nmaneuver will take the spacecraft all the way to the other\nside of the box, in expectation of it slowly drifting back\nthrough the ideal location. This approach minimizes the\nnumber of burns that need to be performed. Other mis-\nsions try to maintain the most accurate location possible\nat all times. This can lead to a much higher frequency of\nmaneuvers.\n\nFor the majority of the year, the spacecraft is never in\nshadow owing to the orbit\u2019s inclination (see Sect. 4.4.3)\nwith respect to the ecliptic plane. During two short periods\nevery year, around the vernal and autumnal equinoxes,\ngeosynchronous spacecraft enter \u2018eclipse season\u2019 where\nthey undergo daily eclipses. This gives rise to the following\nconcerns:\n\u2022 Orbit/attitude effects\u2014For most of its life, the spacecraft\n\nis continually exposed to solar radiation pressure. During\nthis short period, the spacecraft undergoes short period of\ndarkness, which will impact on predictions of orbit and\nattitude evolution.\n\n\u2022 Reduction in power generation\u2014For communications\nspacecraft, power demands can be very high. The oper-\nations team must ensure that the life of on-board batteries\nis maintained for as long as possible. Battery conditioning\noperations must be executed to ensure that the batteries\nretain the ability to store their design capacity.\n\n\u2022 Sensor blinding and Earth tracking loss\u2014The periodic,\ntransient presence of the Sun within the field of view of\nattitude sensors can give rise to physical damage and/or\n\u2018false\u2019 Earth detections. See Sect. 20.3.5.\n\n20.3.5.2 Sensor Blinding and False Targets\nSpacecraft using optical (including infrared) sensors for the\nmaintenance of attitude are susceptible to guidance errors\ncaused by the presence of unexpected astronomical bodies\nin the field of view.\n\nAs an example, in geostationary spacecraft, the use of\ninfrared-based Earth sensors is common. These sensors\ndetect the thermal energy of the Earth and, by monitoring\nthe strength of the detected signal, permit the spacecraft to\nmaintain an Earth-pointing attitude. The presence of other\nheat sources in the bore sight of the sensor can lead to false\n\u2018Earth\u2019 detections and errors in attitude control. Both the\nMoon and the Sun present a risk in this context.\n\nFrom geostationary orbit, the Sun will appear to move\naround the spacecraft once per day. Each day, it will pass\nabove, behind or below the Earth from the perspective of\nthe spacecraft. During the periods around the equinoxes, the\nSun will pass behind the Earth. It is these periods close to\nthe equinox that give rise to significant operational risks for\nsatellites guided by infrared Earth sensors. As the Sun\nmoves close to the Earth\u2019s limb, the sensor may begin to\ntrack off the Earth and follow the Sun, rather than the Earth.\nThis will rapidly lead to a loss of correct spacecraft attitude.\n\nThe transitory presence of the Sun (or Moon) in the field\nof view of the sensor must be accommodated in either the\ndesign of the sensor or the operational procedures of the\nspacecraft. For example, the sensor (or a subfield of it) may\nbe temporarily disabled by the operations team or on-board\ncontrol software, when the presence of the Sun (or Moon) is\neither expected or detected.\n\n20 Ground Segment 593\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nSimilar technical or process-based approaches should be\napplied to the use of other sensor types such star trackers,\nmagnetic field sensors, Sun sensors, etc., wherever the pres-\nence of a transitory input may give rise to guidance errors.\nSuch events can occur, even in deep space missions (e.g.\npresence of an asteroid or Sun in a star tracker field of view).\nThe operations and flight dynamics teams must take pre-\ncautions to avoid such events or minimize associated risks.\n\n20.3.5.3 Orbit Maintenance\nApproaches to station-keeping and orbit maintenance in\nEarth orbit will vary depending on the requirements of the\nmission.\n\nFor geostationary missions, refer to Sect. 20.3.5.\nFor navigation systems (e.g. GPS, Galileo), precise\n\nknowledge (and prediction) of the satellite\u2019s orbital path is\ncentral to the delivery of the service. Orbital tracking is\nperformed over long periods (weeks) in order to derive the\nmost precise estimates possible of the future path of the\nspacecraft. This information forms the basis of the delivered\nnavigation service, allowing users to determine their own\nposition relative to the \u2018known\u2019 location of the satellites. As\na result, knowledge of the satellite\u2019s orbital path is more\nimportant than control. Maneuvers might be performed only\na handful of times over the complete lifetime of the satellite,\nsince each maneuver introduces new variability to the future\norbital path.\n\nFor missions in LEO, atmospheric drag becomes sig-\nnificant. The satellite is slowed by the atmosphere, bringing\nit lower, thereby further increasing the drag effect. Routine\norbit raising maneuvers are required to prevent eventual\natmospheric reentry. Often, satellites in LEO are also\nrequired to maintain a specific ground track, passing over\nthe same points on the ground in a predictable pattern.\nFurther maneuvers may be necessary on a routine basis to\nensure that the ground track does not drift with time owing\nto gravity perturbations similar to those that affect geosta-\ntionary satellites.\n\n20.3.5.4 Solar Sailing for Attitude Control\nAtmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure can give rise\nto attitude perturbations (unwanted rotation) on the space-\ncraft. In the short term, these external forces may be com-\npensated for by reaction wheels,6 which \u2018absorb\u2019 the\nadditional angular momentum, allowing the spacecraft body\nto remain rotationally still. Nevertheless, if the external\nforce is applied in the same direction over a long period,\nreaction wheels will continue to accelerate, eventually\n\nreaching the design limit of the equipment. It is then nec-\nessary to \u2018dump\u2019 the accumulated angular momentum from\nthe spacecraft. Often this is achieved using reaction control\nthrusters or, in LEO, by the use of magnetorquers.7 Both\nmethods require some expenditure of resources\u2014fuel, in\nthe case of thrusters or power in the case of magnetorquers.\n\nA passive method is available for attitude control based\nupon the use of solar pressure and steerable solar arrays.\nAppropriate angling of the arrays, will result in a directed\ntorque on the spacecraft\u2014in a similar manner to wind on a\nship\u2019s sails. Although the force generated by solar pressure\nis small, it can be consistently directed such that the effect\naccumulates over time. For geostationary spacecraft, this\nentirely passive momentum dumping technique may sig-\nnificantly reduce the overall mission requirement for pro-\npellant, which would otherwise be needed for thruster-based\nmomentum dumping.\n\n20.3.5.5 Propellant Management\nDetermining the quantity of propellant remaining in the\nspacecraft\u2019s tanks requires indirect methods. Since the\nspacecraft is in a microgravity environment, the tank cannot\nbe \u2018weighed\u2019 and fuel cannot be assumed to be at a specific\nend of the tank unless it has been physically forced there.\n\nMethods available for determining the remaining quan-\ntity of fuel include\n\u2022 Calibration maneuvers\u2014A thruster burn, of known total\n\nimpulse, can be used to determine the total mass of the\nspacecraft. If the dry mass is known, then the quantity of\nfuel remaining can be derived. This method requires good\ncalibration of the thrusters, since the applied impulse can\nonly be determined from estimates of the firing time and\nthe thruster performance.\n\n\u2022 Thermal Capacity\u2014Applying heaters to the tank results\nin an increased temperature. The rate at which the tem-\nperature rises is related to the quantity of fuel that is being\nheated, and to the heater power that is being applied. The\n(time-varying) dispersal of fuel throughout the tank will\nimpact the rate at which heat reaches different locations\nwithin the tank. Heating over several hours may be\nneeded to achieve a dependable result.\n\n\u2022 Dead-reckoning (pulse counting)\u2014The total fuel con-\nsumption can be estimated based upon the known accu-\nmulated firing time of the thrusters (for both maneuvers\nand attitude control). This method assumes a well-cali-\nbrated relationship between firing time (or number of\nthruster pulses) and the volume of fuel consumed. The\neffect of reducing the tank pressure over the mission\n\n6 A motor-driven, spinning mass. Rotational acceleration and decel-\neration of the mass produces a torque that can be used to steer the\nspacecraft body or to resist an external torque. Wheels can also\nprovide gyroscopic stability.\n\n7 Devices for generating a controlled magnetic field, with a known\norientation. Magnetorquers can be used to apply a control torque on\nthe spacecraft, when a significant external field is present.\n\n594 R. Lowe et al.\n\n\n\nlifetime must be taken into account when considering the\nestimated fuel flow rate.\nFuel gauging is an important consideration. Calculation\n\nof the thruster firing required to achieve a certain change of\nvelocity, DV , depends upon knowledge of the total space-\ncraft mass, including the remaining fuel. Fuel depletion is\nalso commonly a limiting factor on the operational lifetime\nof a satellite. If the satellite is to be deorbited (or placed in a\n\u2018graveyard\u2019 orbit) then the terminal maneuver must be\nconducted while sufficient fuel remains on-board. In the\ncase of a geostationary satellite, this maneuver, known as a\ngraveyard maneuver, involves boosting the orbit height by\nabout 300 km\u2014a requirement recommended by the Inter-\nnational Telecommunications Union (ITU). This ensures\nthat the primary geostationary belt remains usable for new\nmissions.\n\nAn incomplete terminal burn may be worse than no burn,\nbecause it will place the satellite in an uncontrollable and\neccentric orbit that may intersect the paths of other opera-\ntional spacecraft\u2014or produce an unpredictable reentry\nprofile.\n\nAn unnecessarily early terminal maneuver reduces the\nvalue of the mission, either in scientific or commercial\nterms.\n\nNote that for spacecraft with multiple tanks, periodic\n\u2018rebalancing\u2019 of fuel may be required to prevent large\nchanges in the overall center of mass of the spacecraft as\ntanks deplete asymmetrically.\n\n20.3.5.6 Battery Reconditioning\nBattery reconditioning is the process by which a battery\u2019s\nability to efficiently store charge is maintained by periodi-\ncally subjecting it to a deep or complete discharge through a\nresistive load (sometimes a heater is used) and then\nrecharging back to nominal operating charge levels. This can\nbe performed manually or sometimes under software control,\nbut essentially the decision of when to perform this operation\nand on which battery is an operator decision.\n\nReconditioning is made necessary due to the hysteresis\neffect on battery charging that is a result of aging. For\nexample, nickel\u2013cadmium batteries contain two forms of\nnickel hydroxide: a b-form, which is electrochemically\nactive (and hence discharges first) and a c-form, which is\nrelatively inactive. Over time, the b-form is converted into\nthe c-form. A high ratio of b-form to c-form is needed and\nthis can be achieved by periodically conditioning the battery.\n\nGeosynchronous satellites are subject to two eclipse\nseasons per year in which eclipses of the Sun by the Earth\noccur every day (some lasting over an hour) for a period of\nseveral weeks. This results in significant battery discharges,\nforcing the electrical power subsystem (EPS) to restore\nmain charge levels on the batteries once the Sun is regained\non the solar arrays. It is a commonly employed strategy to\n\nrecondition a battery shortly before an eclipse season, both\nto improve its efficiency and to characterize any problems\nor degradations of battery cells etc. Typically, one battery\nwill be reconditioned before the vernal equinox eclipse\nseason and the other will be reconditioned before the\nautumnal equinox eclipse season. Rarely would both bat-\nteries be reconditioned during the same season, and never at\nthe same time. This avoids any risk of simultaneously\ndamaging both batteries (or connected systems).\n\n20.3.5.7 Thermal Management\nMuch of the control of spacecraft heaters will be performed\nautonomously either by using heater control loops or\nmechanically by using thermostats. However, it may also be\nnecessary to manually control heaters for a variety of\nreasons.\n\nThermal modeling before launch is not perfectly accu-\nrate and will only have been approximated in spacecraft\nsimulators. Adjustments to heater loops and heater statuses\nduring the early life of a spacecraft are normal. Manual\nswitching of replacement heaters is also performed, either\nwhen platform or payload units are switched intentionally\nor in response to anomalies and unit failures.\n\nManual switching of compensation heaters may become\nnecessary at particular points in the spacecraft\u2019s lifetime.\nFor example, degradation of the exterior surfaces may lead\nto changes in reflectivity/absorptivity which necessitate\nheater switching. Similarly, the performance of certain\nelectronic units may degrade over the mission, leading to\nchanges in the amount of heat that they dissipate.\n\nIn such situations, if heater loops are under software\ncontrol then it may be necessary to set new thresholds and\nfilters for particular thermal control loops, if this function is\navailable to the operator. Depending upon the spacecraft,\nthis could be performed either with dedicated thermal\ncontrol configuration commands or via a patch of the\nthermal control software (or both).\n\nBy means of example, the thermal environment of a\ngeostationary satellite can be subject to the following\nfactors\n\u2022 Daily Changes\u2014The -X (Earth-facing), +X (azimuth),\n\n-Z (west) and +Z (east) faces of the spacecraft will\nreceive sunlight at angles of incidence between -90? and\n+90? on a daily basis over a period of 12 h at 12 hourly\nintervals. At other times they face deep space.\n\n\u2022 Seasonal Changes\u2014The +Y (south) and -Y (north) faces\nreceive sunlight at angles of incidence between approxi-\nmately -25? and +25? over a 6 month period at 6 month\nintervals such that at an equinox no sunlight reaches the\nnorth and south faces, at the summer solstice the north face\nreceives sunlight, and at the winter solstice the south face\nreceives sunlight.The state of high power payloads can\nhave a large effect on the thermal equilibrium of the\n\n20 Ground Segment 595\n\n\n\nspacecraft. For communications satellites, the thermal\nbudget will typically assume that the payload is continu-\nously switched on and dissipating a large amount of heat.\nDuring periods when the payload is switched off, \u2018simu-\nlation\u2019 heaters may be required in order to substitute for the\nheat normally produced by the payload.\n\n20.3.5.8 Non-geostationary Earth Orbits\nFrom an operations perspective, non-geostationary space-\ncraft in Earth orbit must deal with a greater number of\nissues than their geostationary counterparts. In addition to\ncoping with the effects of eclipses (which may occur far\nmore frequently, depending on the particular orbit), the\noperations team must be able to cope with the variation in\nsatellite visibility from a given ground station.\n\nFor non-geostationary missions, prediction of spacecraft\nvisibility from ground stations becomes a more demanding\ntask. If only a limited number of non-ideally situated ground\nstations are available, as is usually the case, then there may\nbe periods of many hours when the spacecraft is out of\ncontact. The operational impact of such limited visibility is\nthat any commanding must be completed within a finite\ntime, before the uplink is lost again. The ground station\nmust be accurately commanded with a predicted pointing\ndirection to acquire and maintain the spacecraft until visi-\nbility is, once again, lost.\n\nPeriodic loss of contact has significant implications for the\nway in which operations are conducted. Any task that creates\na risk to the spacecraft (e.g. maneuvers, changes of control\nmode, switching of equipment) must be very carefully\nplanned, so that a safe state is assured when the link is lost.\n\nIt is for this reason that many spacecraft are designed\nwith a timeline or master schedule function on-board. See\nSect. 20.1.2.\n\nNote that simple geometric visibility from ground sta-\ntions to the spacecraft is not sufficient to maintain a viable\ncommand link. As the spacecraft approaches the horizon\n(either skimming along it or descending below it), signal\nstrength begins to drop, noise increases, and objects may\nbegin to block the signal (hills, buildings, etc.). Thus, the\nexact moment of terminal signal degradation may be subject\nto some uncertainty. It is normal practice to choose a \u2018safe\u2019\nelevation angle (e.g. 5?) that can be relied upon to provide a\nstrong link. The predicted duration of the pass will be based\nupon time of ascent (acquisition of signal, AOS) and des-\ncent (loss of signal, LOS) past this angle.\n\n20.3.6 Deep Space Missions\n\nThe nature of deep space missions places greater demands\non all aspects of the program, from beginning to end.\n\nOperational considerations include\n\n\u2022 Experimental hardware\u2014Most deep space missions rely\non specialized or novel equipment to achieve their goals.\nWith new equipment comes the need for additional\ntraining, specialist system knowledge, and risk reduction\nplanning.\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a command link\u2014The greater ranges\ninvolved impose strict limitations on the link budget.\nEstablishing a viable link through an omni-directional\nlow gain antenna (LGA) in orbit around Mars requires a\nvery large receiving dish on Earth.8 For a high gain\nantenna (HGA), accurate pointing is needed. In addition,\nprediction of spacecraft visibility becomes more com-\nplex. For example, Mars Express can only communicate\nwhen Mars is visible from the ground station and when\nMars Express is not hidden behind Mars. In addition, the\nspacecraft itself may have a steerable antenna (e.g. the\nEuropean Space Agency\u2019s Rosetta mission) or a fixed\nantenna (e.g. ESA\u2019s Venus Express mission). Flight\ndynamics must provide the correct inputs to guide the\nantenna (or the spacecraft body) such that a link can be\nestablished. Contact passes for deep space missions are\ntypically longer than those for LEO missions. The\nspacecraft remains visible for several hours at a time,\ndriven by the rate at which the Earth rotates, carrying the\nground station out of view of the spacecraft. Since data\nrates are low for deep space links, such long passes are\nvital to achieve sufficient time for data transfer (uplink\nand downlink).\n\n\u2022 Orbit determination\u2014Over the extreme ranges of mis-\nsions like Cassini-Huygens (to Saturn), measurement and\nprediction of exact orbital parameters is a non-trivial task.\nSuch data is required to predict periods of link loss, local\neclipsing, maneuver timing (and vector), observation\ntiming and radiation environment.\n\n\u2022 Light-time\u2014At interplanetary ranges, propagation of radio\nsignals takes a significant period of time. Operators may\nhave to wait many minutes, to hours, before seeing the\nresults of a telecommand. As a result, the level of auton-\nomy on the spacecraft is high since mission control is\nunable to act quickly in the event of a fault occurring.\nCommanding is done almost exclusively via the on-board\ntimeline, and often using on-board control procedures. The\ntime taken for a signal to travel between the Earth and the\nspacecraft is referred to as one-way light time (OWLT).\n\n\u2022 Solar conjunctions\u2014Interplanetary missions may pass\nthrough periods of several weeks when it is not possible to\ncommunicate with the spacecraft. When the Sun comes\nbetween Earth and the spacecraft, all operations must halt\nuntil a link can be reestablished. Operators must configure\n\n8 Following a serious failure, the spacecraft may reorient itself\ntowards the Sun for maximum power generation. An LGA link may be\nrequired, if the spacecraft has lost tracking of the Earth.\n\n596 R. Lowe et al.\n\n\n\nthe spacecraft in a \u2018reduced activity\u2019 state prior to link loss,\nand then reestablish normal operations on reacquisition.\n\n\u2022 Ground networks\u2014Deep space missions require partic-\nularly large antennas, of which relatively few are avail-\nable worldwide. Often, the same dishes will be shared by\nseveral missions\u2014reducing the available uplink time for\neach. Considerable effort goes into optimizing the use of\nfacilities like NASA\u2019s Deep Space Network and ESA\u2019s\nESTRACK; see Sect. 2.2.1.\n\n\u2022 Non-routine operations\u2014For most commercial satellites,\nroutine operations begin after a few weeks or months of\nin-orbit checkout. In the case of interplanetary missions,\nthe mission may continue to evolve over very long\nperiods, requiring sustained planning activity and appli-\ncation of specialist knowledge. Missions such as Cassini-\nHuygens (to Saturn) or Rosetta (to a comet) enter\nsomething approaching \u2018routine\u2019 operations only after\nmany years of flight. The goals and tasks of the operations\nteam change constantly, as different phases of the mission\npass and in response to new scientific objectives.\n\n\u2022 Changing environments\u2014Different phases of the mission\nmay be subject to widely varying environmental condi-\ntions. ESA\u2019s Rosetta comet lander must cope with vari-\nations in the solar environment from Earth\u2019s orbit to the\ndimly lit, cold beyond the orbit of Mars and the dusty\nspace surrounding an active comet. BepiColombo must\nmove from Earth\u2019s orbit to the intense, hot environment\nof Mercury. These issues are not just a problem for the\nspacecraft designer. Modeling and prediction goes on\nthroughout the lifetime of the spacecraft, to allow mission\noperators to make the best decisions in unforgiving sit-\nuations (for example, to determine the level of power that\nwill be available from solar arrays, and spacecraft tem-\nperature, as distance to the Sun varies).\n\n\u2022 Changing technology\u2014Most deep space missions are\nmany years in the making. Allowing for changes in\ntechnology is an important part of mission operations\nplanning. Equipment and software on the ground must be\nmaintainable for the whole lifetime of the project. ESA\u2019s\nRosetta mission can trace its origins back to 1993, with\nlaunch in 2004, arrival at its target (a comet) in 2014, and\ncompletion of its mission in 2015. As an example, during\nthis period the widely used Microsoft Windows operating\nsystem has evolved from Windows 3.1 through to Win-\ndows 8 (at time of writing in late-2013), and will no\ndoubt evolve further by 2015.\n\n20.3.7 On-Board Software: The Operator\u2019s\nView\n\nThe software that runs on the spacecraft\u2019s on-board com-\nputer provides the main interface through which the\n\noperator drives the spacecraft. The vast majority of tele-\ncommands and telemetry packets are issued to, or received\nfrom, the spacecraft\u2019s on-board software (OBSW).\n\nData packet exchange with the OBSW is the primary\nmechanism by which the operator is able to manage\n\u2022 On-board data stores\n\u2022 Attitude and orbit control, and associated sensors and\n\nactuators\n\u2022 Payload activities\n\u2022 Power storage and use\n\u2022 Thermal conditions.For the operator, a strong under-\n\nstanding of the OBSW at the architectural level is vital. In\nearlier generations of spacecraft, commands would be\nspecific to particular actuators or sensors, e.g. \u2018Close\npower relay for reaction wheel 1\u2019. While these commands\nare normally still available to the operator in modern\nspacecraft, the design of OBSW tends to provide layers of\nabstraction, or to allow for more \u2018goal\u2019 based com-\nmanding. For example, the operator may issue a single\n\u2018Enter Sun pointing mode\u2019 command. This command will\nbe implemented by the OBSW through a complex series\nof actions, control loops and decision processes. The net\nresult may involve many sensors, many actuators, much\ncomputation and a considerable period of time to com-\nplete\u2014but from the operator\u2019s perspective is a \u2018simple\u2019\nchange of mode.\nIn general, the operator is able to monitor the progress of\n\nactions on the spacecraft solely through the information fed\nback in the form of telemetry packets.9 Hence, involvement\nin the design of the OBSW is an important aspect of the\noperator\u2019s role in the mission. As with any complex\nmachine, a spacecraft must be designed with operability in\nmind. The parameters available in telemetry are, to a large\nextent, fixed before launch. The operator must be confident\nthat they have the ability to fully understand the state of the\nspacecraft, in both nominal and failure conditions, based\npurely on interpretation of those telemetry packets and/or\nfields that have been \u2018built in\u2019. The implications of this\ndependence upon data parameters can be surprising. For\nexample, the unfolding of a solar array is an action that may\nnot be directly observable by the operator. Its success can\nonly be indirectly deduced by its effects on other systems\u2014\ne.g. increasing voltage as the Sun illuminates the arrays, a\nchange in the spacecraft\u2019s moment of inertia (itself indi-\nrectly observable through subsequent motion of the space-\ncraft), and the physical closing of a contact switch as the\narray moves. The spacecraft operators and designers must\nforesee the need to monitor a characteristic of the space-\ncraft, and then ensure that a method is available to do so.\n\n9 In the case of maneuvers, externally observed flight dynamics data\n(e.g. observed acceleration) may also provide an important route to\nmonitor progress.\n\n20 Ground Segment 597\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_2\n\n\nSimilarly, for commanding, it is important to ensure that a\ncommand is available in the OBSW for every task that the\noperator may want to undertake, in both nominal and failure\nscenarios. Here, again, the operatorhas a significant role to play.\n\nThe end effect of issuing a command to the spacecraft is\ndictated by the design of the software routines that manage that\ncommand on-board. An operator should not issue a command\nto \u2018Enter Sun pointing mode\u2019 without first understanding the\nactions that the OBSW will take in response\u2014and may have\nbeen involved in specifying what those actions should be.\n\nFor example, this command may have a range of effects\non the spacecraft, including\n\u2022 Increased power consumption (if additional actuators,\n\nsensors are switched on).\n\u2022 Misalignment of communication antennas/cameras (if\n\nspacecraft attitude changes).\n\n\u2022 Entry into safety/survival modes (if the Sun cannot be\nautomatically located, e.g. due to eclipse).\n\n\u2022 Depletion of on-board propellant (if thrusters are used for\nattitude control).\n\n\u2022 Activation of faulty hardware (if the OBSW selects\ninappropriate units to perform the action).More capable\nOBSWs require ever more time and effort (and cost) to\ndevelop. As with all automation, increasing complexity\nintroduces its own opportunities for design faults. The\nOBSW is only ever as good as the testing to which it has\nbeen subjected, and the foresight of the engineers who\ncreated it. Once flying, the spacecraft operator retains the\nfinal responsibility to ensure that the right command is\nissued at the right time with predicted consequences. The\nmotivation to get it right is not to jeopardize mission\nsuccess.\n\n598 R. Lowe et al.\n\n\n\n21Technology Management\nGregory L. Davis, Raphael R. Some and Andrew A. Shapiro\n\nEffective management of technology development is crucial\nto advancing state of the art of spacecraft engineering that\nultimately enables new scientific discovery. Key elements of\nthis management activity include understanding technology\nlife cycles, composing and evaluating a technology portfo-\nlio, encouraging and managing innovation, and knowledge\nof best practices for technology task management. A tech-\nnology manager needs to be aware of these essentials within\nthe context of the organizational setting to provide for\noptimal implementation and results. This chapter summa-\nrizes the salient points for each of these key elements, with\nthe intent of providing a useful set of guidelines for the\nprospective aerospace technology manager.\n\nA useful tool that will be referenced throughout this\nchapter for evaluating a technology\u2019s maturity and moni-\ntoring its development progress is the technology readiness\nlevel (TRL) scale, introduced in Sect. 2.3.3. After an earlier\nperiod of gestation within NASA and other parts of the US\ngovernment, the TRL scale was formalized in a white paper\nby Mankins [1] in 1995, and is now widely used across\nindustry, government, and academia to gauge technology\nmaturity. (There are other closely related definitions for TRL\n[2\u20134] but the authors will use the NASA definitions.) Tech-\nnology readiness levels, along with key discriminators and\nexit criteria, are summarized in Table 21.1 and Fig. 2.10.\nThese criteria are extremely useful in evaluating a\n\ntechnology portfolio, which is fundamental to the practice of\ntechnology management.\n\nThe technology portfolio is a set of strategic develop-\nment activities that, upon fruition, provide an organization\nwith unique technical capabilities relevant to its interme-\ndiate-to-long-term goals. Key considerations for managing\na technology portfolio include balancing risk versus reward,\ndistributing TRL content, apportioning \u2018push versus pull\u2019\ntechnologies, deciding whether to \u2018make or buy\u2019, monitor-\ning development progress, and ultimately determining\nreturn on investment (ROI). In addition to the elements\nmentioned above, this chapter will also summarize the\nsalient points for each of these considerations, with\nthe intent of providing another useful set of guidelines for\nthe prospective technology portfolio manager.\n\n21.1 Technology and Product Life Cycles\n\nTechnologies and products alike have a natural life cycle,\nranging from initial concept and technology validation,\nthrough technology maturation and initial product devel-\nopment, to product maturation, and ultimately to obsoles-\ncence and end-of-life. This dual life cycle is summarized in\nthe so-called Whale Chart depicted in Fig. 21.1, which\nshows the relationship of technology utility and/or product\nsales as a function of time. The period between initial\nproduct development and end of life is often lengthy and\nmay include development of a line of products differenti-\nated by advancements in the technology, customer com-\nmunities, quality and reliability levels, and price points, or\nstated differently, market refinement and segmentation.\n\nFigure 21.1 implies that technology/product develop-\nment progresses uniformly, beginning with initial technol-\nogy conceptualization and culminating in a fully matured\nproduct line before lapsing into obsolescence. The reality is\nmore chaotic, often characterized by skipping steps or\n\nG. L.

Management of this\nprocess requires flexibility and understanding of the fact\nthat an orderly progression of technology and product\ndevelopment is a worthy ideal, but pragmatically unrealis-\ntic. It is not unusual, for example, for a development team\nthat believes it is at TRL 5 to discover an issue that requires\na return to TRL 3 to investigate an anomaly or to develop\nsome aspect of the technology that was not previously\nunderstood or even recognized. In the heat of a project, with\nschedules and budgets looming, this situation can be per-\nceived as a major disruption and a desire to forge ahead\nregardless may prevail. This approach is usually a mistake,\noften leading to further schedule delays, budget overruns,\nand in some cases, failed projects. The successful technol-\nogy manager, on the other hand, remains focused on the\nlarger objectives and accommodates the inevitable setbacks,\nresetting the schedule to an earlier TRL if necessary in order\nto make faster progress later on. Technology managers\nshould expect these kinds of developments and plan for\nthem, building in schedule margin and budget reserves. The\n\nauthors typically assume at least one return to a previous\nTRL level in the TRL 3\u20135 time frame, and often\u2014\ndepending on the complexity of the technology develop-\nment\u2014more than one such retrenchment. Similarly, in\ntransitioning from technology to product, where new\nrequirements such as design for testability and manufactu-\nrability come into play, it is wise to assume that a significant\nredesign will be required.\n\nIn addition to the technical challenges outlined above,\nthe prospective aerospace technology manager should also\nbe keenly aware of several important industry-specific\nprogrammatic factors that are challenges to ultimate suc-\ncess. First, product lifetimes are often measured in decades,\nnot years. Unlike the fast paced world of consumer elec-\ntronics, for example, where product lifetimes are often\n1\u20133 years and a product line may last for as little as\n5\u20137 years before being superseded by a completely new\ntechnology, aerospace products and their underlying tech-\nnologies are often maintained for 20\u201330 years or even\nlonger (consider the Boeing 747 product line, now entering\nits 5th decade of service). Furthermore, aerospace\u2019s long\ndevelopment times tend to require larger capital outlays,\n\nTable 21.1 Technology readiness levels (TRL) summary\n\nTRL Description Incremental Change Exit Criteria\n\n1 Basic principles observed and reported Research is transitioned from\npure to applied\n\nPeer reviewed publication of research\nunderlying the proposed concept /\napplication\n\n2 Technology concept and/or application formulated Applications are identified;\ninvention begins\n\nDocumented description of the\napplication/concept that addresses\nfeasibility and benefit.\n\n3 Analytical and experimental critical function and/or\ncharacteristic proof-of-concept\n\nR&D leading to proof-ofconcept\nvalidation is initiated\n\nDocumented analytical / experimental\nresults validating predictions of key\nparameters\n\n4 Component/subsystem validation in laboratory\nenvironment\n\nElements prototyped and tested\nin the laboratory\n\nDocumented test performance\ndemonstrating agreement with analytical\npredictions.

These long-term time\nhorizons require correspondingly long-term commitments\non the parts of the technologist to stay the course in the face\nof the inevitable technical and programmatic challenges that\nwill arise, and of the technologist and the user to commit to\ncultivating an extended partnership with each other. Sec-\nond, many aerospace organizations are culturally risk-\naverse, engendering conservatism in the adoption of new\ntechnology. It is incumbent on the technology manager to\nrecognize and address this conservatism head on. To be\nsuccessful, both management and potential customers must\nbe presented with a picture showing how adoption of the\nnew technology provides an overwhelming (or enabling)\nadvantage not only in the near term, but for the long term as\nwell. Issues to be confronted typically include not only\nperformance, but also reliability, scalability, flexibility, and\nadaptability. Thinking ahead and steering the development\nso that the barriers to adoption are minimized will help to\nensure the technology\u2019s acceptance and infusion.\n\nThe following discussion will distinguish between tech-\nnology and product development activities\u2014while often\nintertwined and overlapping, they refer to separate and\ncomplementary pursuits. Technology development is the\nlinkage of underlying scientific principles, usually based in\nphysics, chemistry, mathematics, and materials science, to\nan engineering application upon which future product\ndevelopment is based. These basic principles are often\nembodied in a model that can be used to predict the\nbehavior of products based on this technology. More spe-\ncifically, a technology model, which is incrementally\ndeveloped and verified through the early-to-mid-TRL lev-\nels, enables accurate prediction of the behavior of an article\nthat has been designed within the space over which that\nmodel has been validated. Products, on the other hand, are\narticles that have been designed, fabricated, and verified to\nperform as predicted by the corresponding technology\nmodel. In many cases, an initial product development is\n\nintimately intertwined with an initial technology develop-\nment; however, a follow-on product development may\ninclude the need for additional technology development or\nextension of the space over which the technology model\nwas initially validated.\n\n21.1.1 Initial Technology Development\nand Product Breadboarding\n\nThe progression from TRL 2 through to TRL 3 is often\nreferred to as initial or early stage technology development.\nIts purpose is preliminary evaluation of the technology or\nproduct concept and initial development of the underlying\ntechnology model. This early phase of technology devel-\nopment is usually not expensive and consequently is more\nreadily funded; thus it is customary to fund a variety of\nthese low TRL efforts and to weed out those that are less\npromising before moving on to the more costly-mid-TRL\ndevelopment stage. From a management perspective, this\nphase is crucial in determining the viability of the tech-\nnology concept and in gaining an understanding of what\nwill be required for development into full maturation and\neventual productization.\n\nThe key to successfully negotiating early TRL technol-\nogy development is to focus the research team on the key\nissues and not to become distracted with ancillary concerns\nthat can be deferred. While some understanding of the\nultimate application of the technology and customer desires\ncan be useful, technology developers at this early stage\nshould not be burdened with achieving an understanding of\ncustomer needs. Indeed, customer input at this point can be\ndetrimental to a successful technology development by\nartificially constraining technologists and inhibiting their\ncreative thinking. Instead, the team should be focused on\nthe key capability desired, stated in relatively broad terms,\nallowing freedom to explore the technology to determine\ncapabilities, constraints, and dependencies.

Adding outside\nresearchers stimulates innovation, further develops a cadre\nof technologists for maturation of the technology (as well as\nearly stage development of future related technologies), and\nmay help to control costs. With universities, it is important\nto realize that their interests lie principally in performing\nfundamental research and publishing, and that they should\nnot be relied on to \u2018deliver\u2019 a \u2018product\u2019 in the way that an\nindustrial organization would. Instead, when working with\nuniversities it is generally best to be able to provide suffi-\ncient funding for at least one Ph.D. student and the super-\nvising professor\u2019s summer salary over a nominal 3 year\nperiod. It is also advisable to require at least semi-annual\nprogress reports, copies of all publishable papers and theses,\nand any experimental results and models. Arrangements\ninvolving multiple universities in related research areas will\nwork best if their research areas are carefully designed not\nto directly compete with each other, and if they are\nencouraged to work cooperatively. Holding a semi-annual\ntechnology interchange meeting (TIM) is also advisable to\nencourage cross-fertilization of ideas and to further coop-\neration. As an example, on a large technology development\nprogram one of the authors enlisted 10 universities to work\non various aspects of a research problem. Each university\nwas contracted to work in a different area of research, but\neach of those research areas was a topic in a larger tech-\nnology development. The contracts provided support for\n2\u20133 Ph.D. students for up to 3 years. Semi-annual TIMs\nwere held to update the universities on overall progress,\nincluding the research being conducted by the authors\u2019\norganization. Several of the universities and professors\ninvolved ultimately developed ongoing relationships with\neach other and with the author. The authors\u2019 organization,\nhowever, was responsible for extracting useful research\ninformation out of the researchers\u2019 reports and incorporat-\ning these advances into the project. Ultimately, in addition\nto supporting the authors\u2019 technology development, several\nPh.D.s were graduated, seminal work was done in one new\narea of research, and a pipeline of Masters and Ph.D. level\nengineers from those universities to the authors\u2019 organiza-\ntion was enabled.\n\nAt the end of this early TRL phase of development, the\nteam should have a \u2018breadboard\u2019, i.e., an improvised test\narticle that has been shown to provide the desired capability\nin a stand-alone mode under ideal or ambient conditions. By\nthis point, the technology model should be capable of pre-\ndicting the performance of a similar test article under\nsimilar operating conditions. Key parameters should have\n\nbeen identified and verified. The following management\nactivities are appropriate upon completion of the early TRL\nwork\n1. Demonstrating the capabilities of the new technology to\n\nupper management as well as to potential users.\n2. Projecting the types of capabilities and products that will\n\neventually be enabled.\n3. Planning for the next stage of technology development\n\nincluding realistic assessment of cost and schedule.\n4. Delineating key risks and forming a strategy to address\n\nthose risk areas as early in the process as possible.\n5. Defining decision points, those points at which crucial\n\ndecisions regarding the path the development task will\ntake are made, including\n\n\u2022 Alternative technology options\n\u2022 De-scoping of activities that cannot be afforded or that\n\ndo not look promising\n\u2022 Termination criteria, those conditions under which it is\n\ndetermined that the technology will not be successful.\nThese decisions and the criteria by which they are made\nmust be defined early; once development is underway, it is\nexceedingly difficult to decide to end it. The authors\nstrongly advise following the guidelines outlined above to\nprovide some discipline to this rather loose phase of the\ndevelopment activity, and to help ensure that precious\nresources are wisely allocated.\n\n21.1.2 The \u2018Valley of Death\u2019\n\nThe progression of TRL 4 through TRL 6 is often referred\nto as the \u2018valley of death\u2019 because of the traditional diffi-\nculty in obtaining the resources required to bridge the\ntechnology development from breadboard to prototype in a\nrelevant environment; see Table 21.1. In this evolution, the\ntechnology is fully developed and validated through a\nsuccession of experimental builds, tests, and evaluations.\nTypically, the process starts with early breadboard testing in\nisolation, then proceeds to testing successively refined\nbreadboards in a system environment, and finishes with\nbuilding a true prototype that is compatible in form, fit, and\nfunction with an inertial product. This phase ends when the\nprototype is tested in the relevant environment; i.e. an\nenvironment that is stressing to the technology and repre-\nsentative of one that the initial product offering will expe-\nrience, thereby validating that the underlying technology\nwill be capable of yielding useful product.\n\nEarly stage TRL development begins with an open, rel-\natively unstructured approach and with the team quickly\nforging ahead to determine viability of the technology. At\nthe conclusion of this stage, both the team and management\nare convinced that the technology is feasible, and man-\nagement provides tentative approval and sufficient funding\n\n602 G. L. Davis et al.\n\n\n\nto proceed to the next level. Over the next months and\nyears, the team will need to transition from rapid early\ntechnology development to a more deliberate development\nmethodology for the mid TRL development to be success-\nful. In particular, specifications are now written, designs are\ndocumented, experiments and tests are designed and doc-\numented more thoroughly, testing becomes as important as\ndesigning the test article, system considerations become\nimportant, and issues of testability and manufacturability\nbegin to arise. This transition will not occur suddenly: rather\nthis evolution needs to be tempered to ensure that money\nand time will not be wasted on the finer points of producing\na product too early in the development stage, and that\ndevelopment issues are addressed in the appropriate order\nas planned at the end of the early TRL development stage.\nThe technology manager is advised to formally notify the\nteam of these new rules of engagement and to augment the\nteam with the necessary complementary talents and possi-\nbly phase out others. A key issue in the transition from early\nto mid TRL is that the early TRL technologists will chafe at\nthe added responsibility of documentation, test, and analy-\nsis; whereas the just-added team members who are accus-\ntomed to a more rigorous approach to development\u2014\nespecially if they come from a product development back-\nground\u2014will likewise chafe at what they perceive to be a\nlack of rigor, of playing fast and loose with the technology,\nand of not understanding the needs of the product devel-\nopers and customers. The manager\u2019s job is to appreciate\nthese differing points of view and to manage the evolution:\nto continually show both sides the need and advantages of\nworking through these evolutionary stages; to focus on the\nkey issues; to maintain progress in order to maintain\nfunding; and to return often to the big picture, which is\nneeded to keep the team motivated and aware of where it\nstands in the overall development process.\n\nAs development proceeds through TRL 5 and 6, i.e.,\nevaluating the technology in a system, then in a \u2018relevant\nenvironment\u2019, and finally to developing a true prototype,\nthere is ever greater need to understand the end use and end-\nuser environment. Obtaining customer input and utilizing\nexperienced aerospace product development engineers to\nbring real-life experience and understanding of realistic\nusage conditions is critical to successfully developing the\ntechnology and to ensuring successful product development\nand infusion. Many technology development efforts have\nfailed because the technology development team did not\nunderstand either the real needs and priorities of the cus-\ntomer, or what was required to take a technology to product.\nAs an example, several years ago one of the authors wit-\nnessed what was portrayed as a highly successful technol-\nogy development that delivered several working prototype\nunits. Given the capabilities of the units and the benefits\n\naccrued to the system that incorporated them, the devel-\nopers expected straightforward and immediate adoption of\nthe technology and infusion into the target system. Millions\nof dollars had been spent over several years to develop this\ntechnology, the test articles worked extremely well, and the\nmodel performance predictions were accurate. From the\ndeveloper\u2019s perspective the development was highly suc-\ncessful and well worth the money spent; however, the\ntechnology was not adopted and the prototypes never made\nit to product. Management asked the author to investigate\nthe situation to determine what happened, and to ensure that\nthe experience would not be repeated. During the investi-\ngation, the product development engineering and customer\ncommunities identified the following issues: (1) lack of\ndocumentation of the testing and validation activities, (2)\ndifficulty in manufacturing, including the cost of manufac-\nture in addition to assembly and inspection, (3) long term\nreliability concerns, and (4) perceived fragility of the final\nproduct to environments encountered in the system. The\nauthor observed that in addition to these explicit issues, an\nimplicit issue was the lack of familiarity with the technol-\nogy and a lack of confidence stemming from lack of insight\ninto the development process. The author was then asked to\nrestart the technology development activity in an attempt to\nsalvage the previous investment, thereby providing the\nbadly needed capabilities that had spurred the original\ntechnology development project. After technically analyz-\ning the prototype and determining its strengths and weak-\nnesses as well as its benefits and cost, the author agreed to\nlead a new technology development task, \u2018resetting\u2019 the\ntechnology maturity level to TRL 3 and planning a new\ndevelopment from that point on. The author then proceeded\nto engage the organization\u2019s lead product and system\ndevelopers, bringing them onto the team and, with their\nassistance, helping the technology developers to understand\nthe needs of product developers and customers. The cus-\ntomer community was similarly engaged as the develop-\nment effort continued to ensure understanding, familiarity,\nand acceptance of the technology, as well as to ferret out\nadoption issues early in the process.\n\n21.1.3 Productization and Technology\nInfusion\n\nThe progression from TRL 7 through to TRL 9 is often\nreferred to as the region of productization and infusion: the\ndevelopment of an initial product, typically quite similar if\nnot identical to the prototype, and the infusion (or sale or\ninsertion) of the product into a system. Arriving at this stage\nmeans that the \u2018valley of death\u2019 has been successfully\nbridged into the region of product development. The\n\n21 Technology Management 603\n\n\n\nultimate customer now becomes the primary focus, and\nattention turns to satisfying the manager who decides to buy\ninto this product and stake his reputation on its long-term\nviability.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the aerospace customer isn\u2019t\nmaking a decision on a product with a 3 year lifetime; the\ncustomer is making what he hopes will be a 20 year com-\nmitment to a technology, a product, and a product line.\nCost, price, affordability, and profit are extremely important\nconsiderations in this stage. The ultimate drivers for success\nwill be benefit to the customer and ROI for the product\ndeveloper/manufacturer. At this point, the product devel-\nopment manager\u2019s job is to elicit from the marketing and\nsales personnel, as well as from potential customers, the\nneeds and desires of the broad customer community, and to\nextract from those requirements and wishes the key features\nthat will be engineered into a product line plan. It is also the\nresponsibility of this manager to continue to refine the\nproduct to maximize customer benefit, thus ensuring con-\ntinued customer loyalty and product marketability while\nconcurrently maximizing profitability of the product and the\nresulting ROI to the organization.\n\nFrom a management perspective, the technology devel-\nopment is complete and product development\u2014a very dif-\nferent task, that deals with manufacturing engineers,\ncustomer representatives, marketing and sales personnel,\nproduct line managers, parts specialists, and supply line\nmanagers\u2014is now underway. This environment is one that\nmany technology developers, including technology man-\nagers, are ill equipped to deal with. Successfully adapting to\nthis environment, however, will ensure the long-term suc-\ncess of the technology, the profitability of the product line,\nand the confidence of upper management in the technology\nmanager\u2019s own abilities.\n\nInfusion of the first product is absolutely critical: success\nor failure of the technology and its future development is\ndetermined at this point. Typically, product engineers rather\nthan technologists implement productization. Technologists\nmay be retained on a consulting basis through its initial\nstages to address transitioning issues\u2014and it is incumbent\non management to ensure that they be made available as\nneeded\u2014but it is not necessary that they be dedicated to the\n\nproductization effort. Typically, the technologists should be\nmoved on to the next project, continuing development of\nthis technology area.\n\nThe productization process is characterized by a high\ndegree of rigor in design, documentation, testing, and\nqualification by those who best understand how the product\nwill be deployed in a system. Afterwards, a transition to\nproduction manufacturing ensues, requiring development of\nmanufacturing tools, documentation, and methods, all spe-\ncialties of product design and manufacturing engineers.\nDesign for manufacturability and testability comes to the\nfore at this point, and if these factors have not been previ-\nously considered, they will often necessitate a redesign of\nthe prototype. Similarly, as the product is aimed at insertion\ninto different target systems, features will often need to be\nmodified or added to meet customer needs or concerns. The\nproduct development manager must develop a longer term\nplan so that engineering time is not wasted and potential\nefficiencies are not lost in the rush to get the product to\nmarket, while at the same time keeping the engineering\nteam focused on getting this first product qualified and\nshipped. Some years ago, one of the authors was involved in\ndeveloping a highly specialized product for a specific cus-\ntomer. In looking at the overall market, however, it was\nclear that a similar capability would be of value to a broader\nmarket place. The product was designed to meet the\nimmediate customer\u2019s needs in a timely fashion, but addi-\ntional features were also incorporated to facilitate easy\nadaptation of the product to other customers. The result was\na profitable product line that was easily adapted without\ncostly redesign for a broader market over a several year\nperiod, and one that provided each customer with a unit\n\u2018customized\u2019 to his specific need at a low cost. Because\nthese customization features did not significantly increase\nproduct complexity, the first product insertion could be\ndone within the schedule and budget allotted, and without\nappreciable increase in longer term manufacturing cost.\n\nOnce the first product has reached some measure of\nsuccess, development of a product line may be possible,\nproviding differentiated products for different market seg-\nments or increasingly more advanced products for the same\nmarket segment; see Table 21.2. In many cases, advances in\n\nTable 21.2 The growth path\nmatrix.

L. Davis et al.\n\n\n\ntechnology will benefit the customer by allowing either a\nreduction in cost or an increase in new features at similar\ncost, thereby increasing the utility and profitability of the\nproduct line. In developing a product line, it will be useful\nto leverage a core design and implementation approach\nacross all members of the product family by defining a\nbaseline\u2014typically lowest price\u2014product. Where possible,\nfeatures that can be incorporated at no additional cost can\nbe used to improve the product or to tailor a version of it to\na specific market, possibly at a higher price point. As the\nmarket matures, it will often be possible to offer the same\nproduct(s) screened to different quality levels, with corre-\nsponding differentiation in price.\n\n21.1.4 Product Obsolescence\n\nTowards the end of the normal product/technology life\ncycle (Fig. 21.1) newer technologies will inevitably over-\ncome the capabilities of the existing product line. This sit-\nuation is not, however, the end of the story. The existing\nproduct line must be maintained indefinitely due to legacy\nproducts that have been fielded\u2014in the aerospace market, a\nmanufacturer cannot simply abandon the customer or the\nproduct line. Meanwhile, new technologies should be\nadapted to fill the niche of the old products: those with\nbetter performance; lower mass, power, volume, and cost\npenalties; or those with higher reliability. These new tech-\nnologies should be made ready to begin their life cycle as\nolder technologies reach the end of their life cycle. And as\nthe organization continues to innovate, the cycle continues.\n\n21.2 The Strategic Technology Portfolio\n\nAs mentioned previously, a technology portfolio is a set of\nstrategic development activities that, upon fruition, provide\nan organization with technologically unique capabilities\nrelevant to its intermediate-to-long-term goals. To develop\na strategic technology portfolio, it is necessary first to have\na concept of what is strategic for the institution. In general,\nthis requires strategic planning, a process often ignored in\nmany institutions. In both for-profit and not-for-profit\ninstitutions, there is significant competition for resources,\nand the immediate problem or \u2018this quarter\u2019s numbers\u2019\noften take precedence. An executive assigned to manage a\ntechnology portfolio must first establish the importance of\nstrategic planning and investment as an institutional prior-\nity, and second, continually remind management\u2014both\nmiddle and upper\u2014of its importance. It is critical that the\nresponsible manager firmly establish the importance of\nmaintaining a critical threshold level of resources for an\neffective and consistent strategic management program,\n\nincluding developing and periodically maintaining a \u2018stra-\ntegic technical plan\u2019 or \u2018roadmap\u2019, and monitoring the\nportfolio. Regardless of the industry, nearly all technology\ninvestments need to clearly be tied to planned products as\ndefined in the strategic technical plan.\n\nIt is difficult to go somewhere\u2014or to even to know that\nthe destination has been reached\u2014without a plan or map of\nsome kind. Technology plans or roadmaps can take many\nforms, and their particular details are best left to the orga-\nnization. There are, however, some common features that\nshould be present in nearly all forms of these documents. At\na minimum, the management team needs to agree on and to\ncodify, at least at top level, what business it is in. In par-\nticular, the products (or product lines) and services the\norganization provides as a business need to be defined. This\nactivity may seem obvious; however, there are many\ninstances where this assessment has not been performed.\nOrganizations have often been surprised to find a disparity\nbetween their actual and perceived business activities. Once\nparticular products have been determined, their future\nstrategic endpoints need to be identified, along with can-\ndidate tactical paths for arriving there. During this process,\nthe following types of questions should be answered\n\u2022 What are the key technical strengths?\n\u2022 What are the technical weaknesses?\n\u2022 Are the technical strengths in line with the future vision?\n\u2022 Do the product lines need to grow [5]?\n\u2022 What is the market expansion strategy, i.e., which growth\n\npath to follow [6]? (see Table 21.2)\nOne outcome from answering these questions should be a\nrealization by the organization of which technologies\nshould be developed internally, leveraging institutional\nstrengths in order to maintain a competitive advantage\nversus which technologies should be procured from other\nsources, acknowledging institutional weaknesses and ceding\nthe advantage to the competition. These so-called \u2018make or\nbuy\u2019 strategies should be addressed in the strategic plan.\n\nAn area that is often overlooked is a strategy for rede-\nploying technical personnel into growth areas of the current\nportfolio and away from non-growth areas or those no\nlonger of interest. It should be noted that occasionally\ntechnical specialists can be moved from one discipline to\nanother. Unlike many other business personnel however,\ntechnical personnel are not fungible; senior technical per-\nsonnel tend to have an extensive historical knowledge base\nthat would take even a highly competent specialist from\nanother field many years to fully learn.\n\nIn addition to securing the importance of and resources\nfor technology, defining products, defining technical direc-\ntions (paths for infusion), assessing strengths, evaluating\ntechnical personnel, and planning growth, a solid strategic\ntechnical plan should also address strategic alliances, uni-\nversity relationships, communications and outreach\n\n21 Technology Management 605\n\n\n\n(conference and committee participation, etc.), publication\nstrategies, and patent/proprietary information (company\nsecret) strategies.\n\nRegardless of the source of a potential technology\ninnovation, if it is not in the existing strategic plan (and\npresumably part of the business strategy), the strategic plan\nis in need of being updated. If neither of these outcomes\nmakes sense in a business context, the investment should\nnot be made.\n\n21.3 Risk Versus Reward\n\nA fundamental consideration in assembling a technology\nportfolio is assessing the balance of risk versus reward.\nRisk, in the context of technology development, represents\nan assessment of the probability of an adverse outcome set\nagainst the consequence of that adverse outcome. One type\nof risk occurs when an investment in a particular technology\ndoes not result in a successful product (or worse results in a\nsuccessful product for your competitor, e.g., the Apple\ninterface from Xerox PARC). The consequence is typically\ntied to the magnitude of the investment: if the investment is\na minor percentage of the institution\u2019s profits (or budget for\nnon-profit institutions), then the consequence of an adverse\noutcome is low. If, however, the investment is the entire\nprofit of the company for several years, then the conse-\nquence of an adverse outcome would likely be catastrophic.\nA related type of risk is overweighting the portfolio in a\nparticular technology at the expense of others. If the com-\npany has a number of candidate technology investments,\nthey all should be represented in the portfolio to the extent\nthat a critical resource mass can be provided. Yet another\ntype of risk that is often overlooked\u2014and one that can be\neven more critical\u2014is the risk of not investing in a new or\nadvancing an existing technology, also known as inverse\nrisk. A striking example of this is the case of Kodak, an\norganization that nominally invented the digital camera but\nhas now filed for bankruptcy and may go out of business at\na time when digital cameras have taken over the market and\nare highly profitable. Kodak made an excellent initial\ninvestment in developing the digital camera; however, it\nfailed to invest in the infusion of this technology, with\ncatastrophic consequences. As extensive discussion of\ninverse risk may be found in [7].\n\nReward, in the context of technology development,\nrepresents an enhanced capability, product line, and/or\nincome stream resulting from an initial investment. The\nmost common measure of success, as viewed by most\nmanagers, is the monetary value of the product sales\nresulting from the technology infused into existing or new\n\nproducts. This tangible benefit is straightforward to calcu-\nlate using standard techniques from finance.\n\nAn excellent example of a critical, successful risk-\nreward trade was the commercial development of the\nBoeing 747 aircraft. In the mid-1960s, with commercial\nlong-distance air travel starting to become widespread,\nBoeing anticipated the need for a \u2018jumbo jet\u2019 to replace its\naging 707 product line. There were huge partner, techno-\nlogical, and financial risks associated with such a devel-\nopment: organizationally, Boeing relied on a partner, Pratt\nand Whitney to develop the new engine; technically, an\nentirely new high-bypass jet engine was required, as was a\nmassive new assembly facility to construct the aircraft; and\nfinancially, the company had to leverage itself heavily to\ncomplete the development program. This bold development\nrisk has been richly rewarded since the rollout of the first\n747 in 1970, with Boeing holding a monopoly in very large\naircraft production for many years afterwards, and with this\nproduct line remaining alive and well today as it enters its\n5th decade of service with over 1,400 deliveries.\n\nIn addition to tangible rewards, there are ancillary and\nsometimes hidden or intangible benefits from technology\ndevelopment projects that may accrue regardless of the\nlevel of financial success. These intangible benefits, which\ncan be quite valuable to the organization\u2019s future strategic\nposition, include developing a familiarity with the tech-\nnology area, training personnel, enhancing organizational\ncapabilities, establishing links to academia and other\nresearch organizations that can further future technology\nobjectives, and establishing a reputation within the industry\nfor promoting technological advancement and for expertise\nin the field. As an example, several years ago one of the\nauthors was involved in the development of a new type of\ncomputing system for advanced spacecraft. Although good\nprogress was being made, several years into the effort the\nclimate had changed and the project objectives were no\nlonger deemed to be of high value to the organization. After\nhaving spent tens of millions of dollars on this development,\nthe project was rather abruptly terminated, the team dis-\nbanded, and the result was deemed a failure for not having\nachieved its stated objectives. That outcome was, to say the\nleast, somewhat disheartening. Within the following\n3 years, however, drawing on expertise developed during\nthe terminated project, a new project with similar goals was\ninitiated. With reduced funding, but with a head start due to\nexperience gained in the previous \u2018failed project\u2019, the new\nproject was able to accomplish its goals quite handily.\nFurthermore, the work done on the original project resulted\nin strong participation in technology conferences, published\npapers, and establishing the organization as a leader in the\nfield, a reputation that was of significant benefit in the\n\n606 G. L. Davis et al.\n\n\n\nmarketing and infusion of related products from the new\nproject.\n\n21.4 Push Versus Pull Technologies\n\nAnother important consideration in assembling a technol-\nogy portfolio is apportioning the mix of \u2018push\u2019 versus \u2018pull\u2019\ntechnologies to diversify risk. Pull or \u2018top-down\u2019 technol-\nogies are those that senior management has identified as\nbeing strategically important to the organization, and those\nthat may provide a competitive advantage when infused into\na product line. Identifying these technologies provides\ninstitutional focus, and a rationale for apportioning scarce\nresources in what is always an oversubscribed R&D budget.\nOn the other hand, \u2018push\u2019 or \u2018bottom-up\u2019 technologies are\nthose that technologists themselves identify as being\npotentially valuable to the institution. They provide a\ncounterpoint to the \u2018pull\u2019 technology process: although\nmanagement may try to select the most promising tech-\nnologies, frankly it isn\u2019t smart enough\u2014and never will be,\nno matter how talented\u2014to always pick the winners.\nAllowing for push technology developments allows for the\nunanticipated breakthrough development (e.g., 3 M Post-it?\n\nNotes) while simultaneously encouraging the creative and\nentrepreneurial behaviors so important to innovation.\n\n21.5 Optimal Portfolio Composition\n\nThe optimal technology portfolio should be balanced across\nmany dimensions: as mentioned earlier key criteria include\nbalancing risk versus reward, distributing TRL content,\napportioning \u2018push versus pull\u2019 technologies, deciding\nwhich technologies to include or exclude (whether to \u2018make\nor buy\u2019), monitoring development progress, and ultimately\ndetermining ROI.\n\nSeveral criteria for managing technology investments\nhave already been mentioned. To recap, first a prudent risk\nposture vis-\u00e0-vis an organization\u2019s resources should be\nadopted; only in the direst of competitive settings should a\n\u2018bet the company\u2019 approach be pursued. As a corollary,\ninvestments should be spread across candidate technologies\nto the extent that critical resources are available. Second,\nthrough strategic planning, an organization should decide\nwhich technologies to include, and which to exclude (\u2018make\nor buy\u2019) in its investment portfolio. Last, an appropriate mix\nof \u2018push\u2019 versus \u2018pull\u2019 technologies should be present;\nalthough there are no hard and fast rules for this ratio,\nexperience has shown that a portfolio composed of\n\napproximately 66\u201375 % for \u2018pull\u2019 and 25\u201333 % for \u2018push\u2019\ntechnologies is most effective.\n\nAn ideal technology portfolio will also span the complete\nspectrum of TRLs. The total investment in each range (low\n1\u20133, mid 4\u20136, high 7\u20139) will vary substantially depending\nupon on the individual company\u2019s status and projected\nneeds. One reasonable strategy is to allocate the same\ninvestment capital for each range. Because lower TRL\ninvestments are often theoretical or crude in nature, they\ntypically will cost substantially less to demonstrate than\nmore mature technologies. Consequently, an even distri-\nbution of funds may result in ten low-TRL projects, three\nmid-TRL projects, and a single high-TRL project. A natural\ndown-selection of concepts as one proceeds up the TRL\nladder occurs because many interesting theoretical or\nlow-TRL concepts prove to be impractical or too costly to\nmove forward. Regardless of the maturity of the technol-\nogy, every technology should have a clear, well-defined\npath to infusion into a real product or it should not be in the\nportfolio. This infusion path should be revisited at each new\nTRL step. A technology portfolio manager must accept the\nidea that most technology concepts will fail and never\nbecome infused. If one in ten technologies progress from\nTRL 1 to TRL 9, the investment program should be con-\nsidered an outstanding success. Most technology portfolio\ntrack records are closer to one in a hundred.\n\nThe effective manager will strive to incorporate all of\nthese considerations into a balanced technology portfolio.\nCreating such a portfolio is not a purely mechanical exer-\ncise, it must also be coupled with good judgment\u2014often\nnuanced\u2014to provide the organization with a technology\ninvestment program with the greatest probability for prod-\nuct infusions. Once composed, the portfolio must be mon-\nitored on a regular basis and its returns measured in order to\nadjust the investment mix.\n\n21.6 Return Metrics\n\nA simple axiom nearly always holds true: whatever gets\nmeasured will improve; judicious selection of what is\nmeasured will inevitably lead to better performance. That\nsaid, ROI metrics for technology are notoriously difficult to\nimplement, but critical nonetheless for providing rationales\nfor disciplined decision-making and resource allocation. A\ncommon approach is to use techniques from classical\nfinance theory. The cost to mature the technology from\nconcept to infusion can be reconciled against the future\nincome stream of the final product (both factoring in the\ntime-value of money) to give a total ROI. In a variation,\n\n21 Technology Management 607\n\n\n\nleveraged return arises when an investment in a specific\ntechnology enables the opening of a new market; the profit\nfrom the entire new market\u2014even though the technology\nmay not have been used in all of its products\u2014can be used\nto compute the ROI. Another financial method is to calcu-\nlate return on assets (ROA) or return on net assets (RONA),\nthereby factoring in laboratory and capital equipment costs\n(which may be difficult to compute if multiple projects use\nthe same lab and equipment) to give a measure of how\nefficiently the organization utilizes its assets. In general,\nusing ROA/RONA for technology investment decisions\nappears to be of diminishingly small value; ROI, however,\nappears to be more useful. In addition to ROI based purely\non profit, some investments\u2019 returns are primarily from\nintellectual property. A well-developed patent portfolio,\nwith its attendant rights to exclusivity and/or licensing/\nroyalty income streams, can often be the most profitable\nproduct of a company. Yet another metric for success is\nhow many technologies advance at least one TRL level in a\ngiven review timeframe. This can be determined by peri-\nodic peer review with a \u2018gate\u2019 process using predetermined\nexit criteria similar to those depicted in the far right column\nof Table 21.1. There are many other metrics that can be\nused, and individual companies need to decide what works\nbest for them. Regardless of the approach used, some form\nof ROI should be calculated for product investments, even\nfor the lowest TRL levels.\n\nAs mentioned previously, in addition to tangible finan-\ncial benefits there are often intangible benefits from tech-\nnology investments that are difficult to quantify, but are\nextremely important nonetheless. One such benefit is\nincreased name or brand recognition, even if the technology\ninvestment itself is not extremely profitable. A good\nexample of this is the benefit derived from the technology\ninvestment in the Mars Pathfinder airbag landing system\n(ALS). Although this investment was not exceptionally\nprofitable for the medium-sized firm that developed and\nbuilt the ALS, the firm received high profile accolades for\nthe system\u2019s successful performance, gained substantially\nincreased name recognition, and ultimately gained better\naccess to space and other related markets. The rewards of\ntechnological leadership derived from participating in\nactivities such as published peer reviewed papers, confer-\nence papers and presentations, professional committee\nparticipation, and hosting of workshops or forums can also\nbe of high intangible value. In these cases, the return is in\nthe technical community\u2019s recognition of leadership: the\nvalue is, presumably, an increased and more loyal customer\nbase from those customers who want to be perceived as\nbeing at the leading edge, or those customers who perceive\nthe organization\u2019s value in technical leadership. Some\ncustomers will pay a premium for this perceived value.\n\n21.7 Managing Innovation\n\nInnovation, on its own, is of little or no use; it is the devel-\nopment of innovation into superior products that is of value.\nDespite many opinions to the contrary, innovation can be\nsystematically managed [7]. Virtually every engineer, tech-\nnologist or scientist has at least one great, innovative idea;\nwhat will make the idea develop into a successful product\nhas much to do with how these concepts are managed and\nhow well disciplined the researcher is. The term researcher is\nused because engineers, scientists, and technologists can\u2014\nand should\u2014perform research into innovative concepts\nencountered while performing their regular jobs. The ensu-\ning discussion is divided into outlining researcher and\nmanagement responsibilities under the innovation process\nand afterwards, describing types of innovation.\n\n21.7.1 Responsibilities in Managing\nInnovation\n\nThe researcher who has an innovative concept needs to\nsurmount several hurdles to be successful. First, and most\nimportantly, the researcher needs to understand exactly how\nhis innovation will benefit his institution\u2019s current or future\nproducts. If the ultimate instantiation of the innovation will\nnot benefit the organization, then the researcher has several\nchoices: drop the concept and work on something else; or\nwith management concurrence, pursue the concept inde-\npendently within the organization; or leave the organization\nto pursue the concept in another company. Assuming that\nthe innovative concept has potential benefit to the institu-\ntion, then the researcher has to surmount two additional\nhurdles: securing funding, and defining a pathway from the\ninnovation into an initial flight product.\n\nThe researcher has a responsibility to persuasively\nanswer a series of questions to convince management or a\nproposal sponsor to give the innovative concept funding.\nThe following is a version of these so-called \u2018Heilmeier\nquestions\u2019, first posed by George Heilmeier (born 1936) of\nDARPA in the 1970s [8].\n\nQuestions to be answered for a successful innovation\ndevelopment.\n1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives\n\nusing absolutely no jargon. What mission need are you\ntrying to meet?\n\n2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current\npractice? What is the current state of the art? Describe\nthe limitation of the state-of-the-art to meet the need.\n\n3. What\u2019s new in your approach and why do you think it\nwill be successful? Why does the current technology not\n\n608 G. L. Davis et al.\n\n\n\nmeet the mission need? What technology needs to be\ndeveloped to meet that need?\n\n4. Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it\nmake? What are the unique benefits to the mission? Why\ndo you think you can beat the competition?\n\n5. What are the risks and the payoffs?\n6. What is your unique innovation to meet the need with\n\nrespect to the competition?\n7. How much will it cost? How long will it take? What are\n\nthe major deliverables? Why is there a need to do this\nwork?\n\n8. What are the mid-term and final \u2018exams\u2019 to check for\nsuccess?\n\n9. Why should the sponsor fund this?\nBy answering these questions thoughtfully, before any\nsignificant effort is invested, the innovation has a much\ngreater chance of becoming useful. By the end of this\nprocess, there should be a clear indication whether the\ninnovation has a chance for success or not. If so, funding\nshould be sought through many avenues; if not, no addi-\ntional effort should be spent on the concept. It should also\nbe noted that, over the development cycle, answers to many\nof these questions are likely to change; this should not be\nviewed as a barrier to either the researcher or to manage-\nment, but rather as an opportunity to realistically reassess\nthe innovation\u2019s prospects for ultimate success. Innovation,\nby nature, is dynamic and should be expected to change.\n\nEmbedded in question 7 above are some of the more\ncritical issues for the researcher to focus on. Formulation of\na development strategy with key milestones and delivera-\nbles\u2014these need not be extensive or numerous\u2014will force\nthe researcher to plan extensively, probably the most\nimportant thing that can be done to ensure an innovation\u2019s\nsuccessful realization. One tool that can be useful in this\nregard is some type of project planning software. Estimating\nthe cost to achieve each of the milestones and deliverables,\nincluding capital equipment and materials, is time well\nspent. It should be noted that these plans will inevitably\nchange (and will need to be revised); however, the planning\nexercise focuses thought and facilitates accommodating\nchanges. Having a well thought out plan and cost estimate\nwill make obtaining funding from any source (internal or\nexternal) much more likely.\n\nWith a plan and funding, the last remaining activity is to\neffectively track progress to determine whether the inno-\nvation development is on plan, off plan, or that the plan is in\nneed of revision. Periodic reviews by management are a\nuseful tool for enforcing this discipline. Reviews should be\nheld at least biannually, and quarterly reviews are usually\nbeneficial. Concerns are often heard about too much over-\nsight and too many reviews stifling innovation. In the\nauthors\u2019 experience of managing innovation over several\n\ndecades, this has not been found to be true; in fact, requiring\na small amount of discipline from researchers tends to focus\nthem rather than stifle them, and a lack of discipline in\nforming a plan often results in wasted resources and no\nadvancement of the innovation. Of course, management can\ngo overboard by requiring onerous reporting and reviews,\nand obviously this situation must be avoided.\n\nInstitutional management has a responsibility to create\nan environment that fosters and stimulates innovation.\nThere may be some arenas in which innovation is less\ncritical, such as in safety procedures and production lines,\nbut it is absolutely critical for technology development.\nProminent ways that management can create an environ-\nment to encourage innovation are given below (there are\nmany more)\n1. Buy-in\u2014Demonstrate by actions and words that inno-\n\nvation is highly valued as an institutional priority.\nInnovation must be recognized and rewarded, and its\nprogress included in annual performance reviews.\n\n2. Generic resources\u2014Provide a small amount of funding\nfor all technical staff to \u2018fool around\u2019 with creative ideas.\nSome companies fund 10 % or more of their technical\npersonnel\u2019s time in this way.\n\n3. Dedicated resources\u2014Reserve dedicated internal\nresearch and development (IR&D) funding to develop\nthe best concepts. One strategy is to have several levels\nof funding: one level of slightly larger funds to develop\nmore mature concepts, one of smaller funds for less well\ndeveloped concepts, and one for workshops where field\nexperts are called into help clarify and focus a concept.\n\n4. Periodic solicitations\u2014Issue periodic calls for new\nconcepts. Review many and select a few for develop-\nment funding. Again, consider several levels of funding.\n\n5. Proposal support\u2014Provide help and resources for pro-\nposals from external sponsors (NASA, DoD, DoE,\nDARPA, etc.). Provide a bid and proposal (B&P) budget\nto enable high quality proposals. Provide proposal\nassistance and independent peer review.\n\n6. Teaming\u2014Encourage teaming within and external to the\ninstitution. Provide a teaming budget. Reward individ-\nuals that successfully team with outside institutions;\nreward managers that arrange internal teaming arrange-\nments. Cultivate long-term relationships with outside\nentities at all levels including executive management.\n\n7. Academia\u2014Provide for a university-funding program.\nBuild relationships with top universities in the field and\nfund them on a regular basis. Remembering that it takes\n5\u20136 years for a typical Ph.D. student to graduate, provide\nlonger duration funding.\n\n8. Planning and documentation\u2014Require documentation\nand planning for concepts that people want to develop.\nHave them answer Heilmeier\u2019s questions.\n\n21 Technology Management 609\n\n\n\n9. Progress reports\u2014Have periodic reviews of progress\n(short time per task). Check plans against milestones and\ndeliverables. Examine spending rates and consider a\nsimple earned value system (see following discussion).\n\nA few additional words should be said regarding research\ntask selection and progress reviews. Most aerospace insti-\ntutions would have an abundance of innovative concepts if\nthe technical workforce were allowed or encouraged to\npursue them. Solicitations for innovative concepts should be\ninstitution-wide, and all technical personnel from new-hires\nfresh out of school to the most senior technical staff should\nbe encouraged to respond (if only senior individuals are\nencouraged, it will indicate that not all innovations are\nwelcome; young researchers may be paired with senior\nresearchers to help balance out ages). For task selection, the\ninstitution needs to develop a systematic way to review\nconcepts that should be strictly merit-based. A review board\nof 5\u201310 highly experienced individuals from diverse back-\ngrounds, each representing an important area of the institu-\ntion, typically works well. Evaluation criteria should include\n\u2022 Innovation\u2014has it been thought of before?\n\u2022 A clear pathway to a flight application.\n\u2022 Alignment with institutional goals.\n\u2022 Technical feasibility.\nTasks should be ranked using these (or similar) criteria, and\nthe number of tasks selected from the top of the list\naccording to the budget available.\n\nWith regard to the review process, again the institution\nshould use a diverse board of 5\u201310 experienced technical\nindividuals, its purpose being to determine whether the\nassigned funds were being expended wisely. Progress,\nachievements, milestones, and expenditures should be\nevaluated. A simple way to do this is to use two \u2018earned-\nvalue\u2019 indices, there are many possible such indices, but\ntwo simple ones that have proven to be effective are (%\nschedule/% funding) and (% completed milestones/%\nfunding). The tasks are on plan if both indices are near one.\n\n21.8 Types of Innovations\n\nThere is a wealth of literature on this subject, but broadly\nspeaking innovations tend to fall into two categories:\nincremental and disruptive. Both are important. Incremental\ninnovations, which take current technologies and improve\nupon them, serve a critical function for remaining com-\npetitive in established businesses and product lines. Small\nincrements in infusing new product technologies do accu-\nmulate, and more often than not they make the difference in\nremaining ahead of the competition; furthermore, innova-\ntions that are in line with conventional thinking are easier to\nadapt and are much more likely to be infused quickly. By\nfar, most industrial research as well as most university\n\nresearch is incremental. Very few individuals or organiza-\ntions have the mindset to do anything else.\n\nThe alternative to incremental innovation is \u2018disruptive\ninnovation\u2019, innovations that completely change the land-\nscape of a particular product or product line. Disruptive\ntechnologies have some common characteristics [9]: they\ntend to revolutionize the field they are in; they often provide\nlower quality or performance but at a greatly reduced cost;\nand they also tend be so disruptive that the existing tech-\nnology becomes irrelevant. Many such examples exist: the\ninternal combustion engine, nylon, the personal computer,\nthe low-cost CCD for cameras, the Sony Walkman, and the\nApple iPod. In each of these instances, the resulting per-\nformance was inferior (at least initially) but the product was\ninexpensive and could be made in much higher volumes.\n\nDisruptive innovation is much more difficult to anticipate\nand to manage than incremental innovation. In terms of\nmanagement responsibilities, some of the previously listed\nitems will easily work and some will be more difficult; they\nare re-summarized below.\n1. Buy-in\u2014Much more difficult, particularly with senior\n\nmanagement. Ideas will be perceived as irrelevant to\nconventional products and may displace existing prod-\nucts in which the management has a vested interest.\n\n2. Generic resources\u2014This approach should still work\nwell.\n\n3. Significant resources\u2014This approach will work well at\nlow TRL, but will meet more resistance as the technol-\nogy progresses up the TRL ladder. A well-selected\nreview board can help to mitigate this problem.\n\n4. Periodic solicitations\u2014This approach will work well so\nlong as it is made clear that disruptive concepts are\nallowed.\n\n5. Proposals\u2014This approach remains absolutely neces-\nsary, but more difficult to fund. Peer review needs to be\nopen-minded.\n\n6. Teaming\u2014Teaming may be difficult for disruptive con-\ncepts because the partners will need to adopt the dis-\nruptive vision.\n\n7. Academia\u2014Mixed, as few academicians are working on\ndisruptive frontiers, but their research bias for low TRL\ncan lead to fundamental breakthroughs.\n\n8. Planning and documentation\u2014Still necessary and\napplicable.\n\n9. Progress reports\u2014Still necessary and applicable.\nObtaining buy-in for disruptive innovations from both the\nsenior management and the technical staff is perhaps the\nmost difficult challenge for the organization. One strategy to\naddress this issue is to train the senior management team to\nunderstand and to seek out disruptive technologies; having\nit completely embrace disruptive concepts would be ideal.\nSenior management\u2019s receptivity to disruptive innovation\nshould set an example, aiding the technical staff in doing the\n\n610 G. L. Davis et al.\n\n\n\nsame. One hurdle that will be a challenge is for the technical\nstaff to overcome its natural inertia to forced progress; some\nstaff will resist having their previous work made obsolete.\nAnother hurdle is the creativity barrier; it is difficult for\nmany staff to think \u2018out-of-the-box\u2019, tending instead to be\nconstrained by what can be accomplished with minimal\nrisk.\n\nIf creative concepts can be unleashed without penalty\nand even encouragement from management, many ideas\nshould then come forward. Once a disruptive concept has\nbeen identified, it needs to be supported with the correct\nlevel of funding. Excessive funding will attract unwanted\nattention and a plethora of non-contributing personnel; too\nlittle funding will eventually kill the concept by starvation.\nThese respective levels are organization-specific, but a\nsavvy manager will recognize where these levels are for his\nor her own institution. Once the disruptive concept is\nidentified and funded, programmatic tracking (documenta-\ntion, planning and progress reporting) become critical to\nkeep the concept on track. Without oversight, the concepts\ntend to stray into territory that is not compatible with\ninstitutional needs. The person who conceives of the dis-\nruptive concept is often not the best one to carry it forward\nand careful team selection, including low-level leaders with\na \u2018vision\u2019 of where the program needs to go, becomes key.\nIn this situation, the individual conceiving the concept\nneeds to be well rewarded in order to encourage the gen-\neration of more disruptive concepts. This is particularly true\nwhen another person is selected to carry the new concept\nforward.\n\n21.9 Reward Systems\n\nIt is axiomatic that desired behaviors should be rewarded\nbehaviors. Innovation is no exception; in fact, effective\nreward systems are particularly important in this arena. In\nthe example immediately above of a disruptive innovation,\nclearly there needs to be a significant award for the initiator,\neven if that person is not selected to carry the concept\nforward. Rewards for innovators can be provided in a\nvariety of ways, including\n\u2022 Management and peer recognition\n\u2022 One-time monetary awards (bonuses)\n\u2022 A percentage of return from the product\n\u2022 Salary increases\n\u2022 Promotions\n\u2022 Choice in future assignments\n\u2022 Paid sabbaticals\n\u2022 Technology promotional paths equivalent to those for\n\nupper management.\n\nA few additional words are in order regarding reward\nsystems. An excellent motivator for providing a clear\npathway to product infusion\u2014always very challenging\u2014\nis to provide a percentage of return on a fielded product\ndirectly to the innovator for his or her invention. And\nfinally, the last reward mechanism in the list is probably\nthe most important. Sadly, it is a well-known phenome-\nnon that many promising young technical innovators\njump over to management when approaching mid-career\nbecause the financial and career rewards for a technical\ncareer path are inferior to those for the management\ntrack. Technologists need to have the freedom to be\ncreative and to move up in an organization through their\ncontributions as successful innovators, and be appropri-\nately rewarded for doing so.\n\n21.10 Organizational Implementations\n\nIn the context of this chapter, the primary function of the\norganization is, through innovation, to transition technology\nfrom concept to product (market). Classic organizational\nbehavior texts [10, 11] consider the organization to have\nmultiple facets, e.g., structural, political, and cultural; this\nsection will consider only the structural aspect. Tradition-\nally, aerospace technology-oriented organizations are\nstructured along functional, product, or matrix lines; a dis-\ncussion of other organizational forms may be found in [11].\n\n21.10.1 The Functional Organization\n\nThe traditional functional (or departmental) organization is\nthe oldest organizational form and is structured along\ntechnical specialty or discipline lines. Staffs are grouped by\ndiscipline, each arranged in its own hierarchy, and they\nwork independently of other departments or associated\nprojects [11]. Advantages of this approach include encour-\naging deep levels of technical expertise that foster more\nintimacy with technologies under development, and having\nso-called economies of scope that facilitate reallocation of\nresources across tasks within functions. Disadvantages of\nthis organizational approach include lack of coordination\nand integration across discipline lines and poor respon-\nsiveness to market changes [10].\n\nIn a functional organization, the technology manager\nmust be cognizant of these coordination, integration, and\nmarket awareness challenges. The organization will tend to\nobscure these issues, leaving an inexperienced technology\nill prepared to deal with larger projects that require inter-\ndisciplinary teams, or with changing market conditions that\n\n21 Technology Management 611\n\n\n\nrender technology and product lines rapidly obsolete.\nDeveloping both formal and informal relationships with\nother functional technology managers as well as with\nmarketing and sales managers, holding regular interchange\nmeetings, and developing other market information sources\nis a viable strategy that will help the functional manager to\nremain influential and effective in the face of these forces.\n\n21.10.2 The Product Organization\n\nThe traditional product (or project) organization aggregates\nstaff from diverse functions to produce an output or product.\nAdvantages of this approach address the disadvantages of\nthe functional approach; helping to ensure better coordina-\ntion and integration across functions, increasing respon-\nsiveness to market changes, and providing for clear strategic\norganizational focus. Disadvantages of this organizational\napproach include a possible erosion of discipline focus to\nthe detriment of new technical discovery, and a focus on\nexisting product lines to the neglect of other possible new\nopportunities [10].\n\nTechnology managers will generally retain a strong\nconnection to their technology discipline, but those who\nhave drifted from technology development into product\ndevelopment may have difficulty keeping up with advances\nin their field, becoming insulated from new capabilities and\napplications. Maintaining connections with academic and\nresearch institutions, participating in technology confer-\nences, and generally keeping up with advances in their\ntechnology area is a straightforward strategy that will offset\nthe relatively minor disadvantages incurred by working\nwith a product focus.\n\n21.10.3 The Matrix Organization\n\nA matrix organization is a hybrid structure that seeks to\naddress the shortcomings of functional and product\n\norganizations by blending the advantages of both into a\ntwo-dimensional management structure: one dimension\norganized by function, the other by product, with the ma-\ntrixed (or projectized) staff reporting to two managers; see\nFig. 21.2. In theory, this structure relies on the competing\ninterests of functional and product management to produce\nan optimal outcome, i.e., functional management\u2019s interest\nin preserving technical integrity (at the potential expense of\ngetting product to market) is balanced against product\nmanagement\u2019s interest in getting product to market (at the\npotential expense of technical quality). In practice, this\noptimal balance is not always achieved, with one dimension\nof the matrix dominating the other and leading to products\nthat move to market either too slowly (functional domi-\nnance) or too quickly (product dominance). A summary of\nthe various organizational outcomes depending upon the\nrelative influence of the constituent parts of the matrix is\nsummarized in Table 21.3 [12]. In recent years, this orga-\nnizational form has fallen out of favor because of the\naforementioned drawbacks and lack of clarity in reporting\nlines [10].\n\nFor larger projects, where it is feasible to do so, matrix\norganizations will often \u2018soft projectize\u2019, i.e., form project\nteams whose members are co-located in a specific area\ndedicated to the project team and somewhat isolated from\ntheir functional organization. Once the project has been\ncompleted, the team is disbanded and personnel are returned\nto their home organizations. If managed correctly, with\nproper attention being paid to rotating individuals between\nproject and functional organizations, this technique can\nameliorate some of the drawbacks in matrixed organizations\noutlined above. More specifically, projects can retain access\nto dedicated experts as needed, and domain experts can\nreturn to their technology organizational roots where they\nhave the opportunity to catch up on advances in their field,\nperform research and development work, and bring back to\nthe technology organization an understanding of real-world\nproject and product issues. A key challenge for the insti-\ntution is to manage this personnel rotation, balancing, at a\n\nChief Executive\n\nEngineering\n\nManufacturing\n\nMarketing\n\nProduct A Product CProduct B\n\nProject\n\nFig. 21.2 A functional-product matrix organization\n\n612 G. L. Davis et al.\n\n\n\nhigher level, the competing interests of the project and\nfunctional managers to ensure that the overall institutional\nbenefits are realized and that individuals do not become\nmired in one role for too long. Having regular meetings\nbetween project and home organization to coordinate per-\nsonnel assignments, as well as ensuring that project-\nassigned individuals participate in departmental staff\nmeetings and technology review functions such as confer-\nences, will help to maintain institutional balance and per-\nsonnel integration.\n\n21.10.4 Skunk Works\n\nA so called \u2018skunk works\u2019, taking its name from legendary\nLockheed advanced development projects such as the U-2\nand SR-71 Blackbird aircraft, describes a group within an\norganization that is given a high degree of freedom, unfet-\ntered by standard bureaucratic processes, to generate\nbreakthrough developments. The implicit connotation\nof the term is that of minimally constrained budgets, a\nfreewheeling engineering team, and freedom from man-\nagement. This section will discuss some of the issues\nencountered when managing such a project.\n\nThe principal advantage of skunk works programs is that\na small, highly skilled and experienced team, left largely to\nits own devices and with minimal management oversight,\ncan rapidly explore new technologies and develop proto-\ntypes. The operative phrases here are highly skilled and\nexperienced together with minimal management oversight.\nHighly skilled and experienced implies that the team has the\ndeep reservoir of technical talent relevant to the task at hand,\nand an innate understanding, after many years of developing\ntechnologies and products, of many of the issues previously\ndiscussed in this chapter. Minimal management oversight\nimplies that the team is capable of exercising successful self-\nmanagement, which requires not only understanding the\n\nchanging level of rigor as the development proceeds from\nlow to high TRL, but also understanding and managing the\ncomplex team dynamic that inevitably results from the\ninterplay of individual personalities. The entire team must\nunderstand and be committed to these self-imposed disci-\nplines. It should also be noted that \u2018minimal management\noversight\u2019 does not mean no management oversight, but\nrather that the management oversight process is streamlined\nand engineered to assist rapid development.\n\nThe principal disadvantage of skunk works programs is\nthat skunk works teams rarely meet the fundamental criteria\noutlined above: i.e. being highly skilled and experienced,\nalong with operating with minimal management oversight.\nSkunk works teams are often constituted imperfectly, with\nindividuals lacking the necessary expertise and/or experi-\nence, and with management rarely creating optimal condi-\ntions for streamlined development. Consequently, more\noften than not, products from these efforts fall well below\nexpectations.\n\nThe challenge for technology managers in skunk works\nenvironments is to select the appropriate team, set appropriate\nstandards, keep upper management at bay, and successfully\ndeliver breakthrough technology and product prototypes on a\nshort schedule for affordable budgets. Inasmuch as the team is\nby definition isolated from the rest of the organization, and\npossibly from its industry as well, and perhaps in secret, it is\nincumbent upon the technology manager to maintain orga-\nnizational interfaces and keep abreast of any technological or\nproduct breakthroughs in these other arenas. If the duration of\nthe project is short, as is usually intended, this will not be an\nissue, but if the skunk works project is large and long term,\nother arrangements will need to be made. Beyond this, the\ntechnology manager needs to be acutely aware of team\ninterpersonal relationships, technical progress, and the myr-\niad daily issues arising that could derail the team. Manage-\nment styles are different and a good manager will adapt the\napproach to the situation at hand, but there is no substitute for\n\nTable 21.3 Organizational influences on projects; ?

This section,\nhowever, will focus on those aspects of technology task\nmanagement that are different from other development tasks\nor are of special significance to technology tasks, and it will\noffer practical guidelines to successful technology task\nmanagement based on the authors\u2019 experience.\n\n21.11.1 Task Management/Leadership\n\nPerhaps the primary task of the technology manager is to\nsell the technology and keep it sold. The practical truth is\nthat technology development costs money and, without\nfunding, the task will wither and die. While technology\n\u2018push\u2019 is often spoken of, the reality is that this motivator is\nusually not sufficient to sustain funding. Rather, funding of\ntechnology through the mid-TRL phase, and sometimes\neven the early-TRL phases, requires a \u2018pull\u2019 from stake-\nholders, coming from the capabilities that the technology\npromises to enable. From upper management\u2019s perspective,\nthe task goal is not to develop technology for its own sake,\nbut rather to provide a capability that has been defined as\nnecessary or highly advantageous to the organization\u2019s\nbusiness plan, strategic vision, or next generation prod-\nuct(s). Furthermore, investment in the capability(ies) under\nconsideration must be made within available resources and\nprovide an acceptable ROI.\n\nThere may be several technologies that are capable of\nproviding the desired capability, and similarly there may\nbe several different capabilities of interest to upper man-\nagement. Thus, especially in the early phases, the tech-\nnology task may be in competition with other technologies,\nother approaches to development of the technology of\ninterest, or a completely different set of desired capabili-\nties. The technology manager must be aware of this\ncompetition from both internal and external sources, and\n\nperiodically reassess the technology\u2019s ability to realisti-\ncally provide the desired capabilities at the envisioned cost.\nUpper management will be monitoring the performance of\nthe technology development team to determine if its\ndevelopment should be allowed to continue, and if so, at\nwhat funding level.\n\nMost organizations cannot afford to maintain multiple\ncompeting technology development tasks throughout the\nentire development process, so it is typical to down-select\nat the breadboard or TRL 3\u20134 stages, where budgets are\nstill relatively small. To survive beyond this phase and be\npromoted to the mid-TRL \u2018valley of death\u2019, the task\nmanager must continue to persuade upper management of\nthe capability or benefit that the technology is intended to\nprovide, and to demonstrate adequate progress toward\nthat goal. Therefore, the first order of business is to\ndefine the capability or benefits to be provided by the\ntechnology in specific and quantitative terms, i.e., provide\nmetrics that can be measured and compared to existing or\nalternative technologies. Metrics may be in the areas of\nperformance, reliability, cost, or ease of use, to name just\na few; but whatever they are, they should be specific,\nmeasurable, amenable to demonstration in an incremental\nmanner and, once they have been integrated, demonstrate\nthe desired capability. Setting task goals and objectives\naccomplishes this.\n\n21.11.2 Setting and Effectively Using Goals\nand Objectives\n\nGoals and objectives are an often-misunderstood and con-\ntentious subject in technology development. A goal may be\nthought of as the desired end point, i.e., the desired capa-\nbility or benefit to be provided by the technology that is\nbeing developed. It may be stated in either quantitative or\nqualitative terms, depending on who is defining the goal and\nthe context in which it is being used. The technology\nmanager must be flexible in this regard: to an immediate\nsupervisor, the goal might be stated as a very specific\nquantitative metric, e.g., \u2018\u2018the technology being developed\nwill be capable of providing 20 Gb/s bandwidth over 30 m\nfor under 20 mW of power dissipation.\u2019\u2019 While to upper\nmanagement, marketing, or product managers, the goal\nmight be stated as \u2018\u2018to enable a performance improvement\nthat will leapfrog other available products by at least 30 %\nat no additional production cost.\u2019\u2019 Objectives, on the other\nhand, are clear and unambiguous, and, when realized in\ntheir entirety, achieve the desired goal. They are sometimes\ndescribed by the acronym SMART: Specific, Measurable,\nAttainable, Relevant, and Timely. In addition, objectives\n\n614 G. L. Davis et al.\n\n\n\nshould be capable of being broken down into sub-objectives\nthat can be demonstrated in an incremental fashion so that\nsignificant progress can be shown as the task progresses\nthrough the TRL levels.\n\nAs discussed previously, it is critical to keep upper\nmanagement enthusiastically supportive of the technology\nunder development. To this end, the task manager must not\nonly set objectives, but also stage demonstrations on a\nregular basis, showing the continuing advancement of the\ntechnology towards its ultimate goal by meeting the stated\nobjectives. For example, one of the authors was involved in\na technology task for which the goal was to revolutionize\nspacecraft avionics by developing electronics capable of\nreliably operating over an extreme temperature range, dra-\nmatically minimizing the need for thermal management\nalong with its associated power, mass, and operational\ncomplexity. One objective was to develop an analog ASIC\ntechnology capable of meeting a set of required metrics for\noperational amplifiers and other analog components that\ncould be designed using off-the-shelf tools, be produced by\na commercial foundry, and exhibit at least a 10 year life\nwhile operating across a temperature range of -135 to\n+185 ?C. The objective was broken down into specific sub-\nobjective milestones, including the development of several\nfoundational components, e.g., operational amplifier,\nswitch, current source, and voltage reference, that met\nelectrical operational requirements over the specified tem-\nperature range. As each component was designed, simu-\nlated, and then fabricated, it was tested and demonstrated\nacross the temperature range and stressed for lifetime. With\neach demonstration, confidence in both the technology\u2019s\nability to meet objectives and its ultimate goal was\nincreased. Demonstrations were held frequently to keep the\npromise of the technology in front of upper management.\nThe same strategy is useful in keeping the technology\ndevelopment team motivated and enthusiastic: frequent\ndemonstrations motivate the team by showing that their\nhard work and dedication is paying off, that they are win-\nning the technology development game, and that success is\nnot only possible, but probable. It also serves to expose the\nteam to upper management and the recognition that comes\nwith management\u2019s acknowledgement of the team\u2019s\nachievements. Setting sub-objective-based milestones and\nusing them to stage demonstrations that showcase accom-\nplishments is an effective tool for the technology manager:\nin the above example, the series of demonstrations inspired\nnot only the upper management but the technology devel-\nopment team as well. When problems came up, as they\ninevitably do when developing a new technology, the team\nwas not deterred but remained motivated to overcome the\nobstacles and thereby show that they could succeed.\n\n21.11.3 Defining the Technological Innovation\nor Advance\n\nGoals and objectives are useful management tools, but\ntechnology tasks also require specific definition of the\ninnovation or technology advance that is being developed\u2014\nand that can often be quite difficult to define. For example,\none of the authors was involved in developing a high per-\nformance computing system for space, based on the use of\ncommercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, and only\nafter weeks of discussion did it become clear that the real\ntechnology advance was in the mid-level software that\nmanaged the computing system and in the analysis tools\nused to evaluate the radiation characteristics of the COTS\ncomponents. All other elements, both hardware and soft-\nware, were readily obtainable with no technology devel-\nopment. The focus of that technology development then\nbecame the development of complex COTS hardware\ncomponent radiation test and analysis techniques and the\nmiddleware used to detect and manage radiation induced\nfaults. Prior to that realization, the task was seen as being\nextremely complex with multiple interdependent facets.\nAfterwards, the task was sharply focused on two indepen-\ndent developments, and its tractability, efficiency, and cost\nwere greatly improved. With the new focus, meaningful and\nsharply defined demonstrations could be planned and exe-\ncuted, and both management and the technology team could\neasily monitor progress.\n\n21.11.4 Defining the Relevant Environment\n\nIn addition to defining the technological innovation, the\ntechnology task manager must define the environment in\nwhich the technology is to be utilized. The \u2018relevant envi-\nronment\u2019, the key discriminator to progressing to mid TRL,\nis that environment which maximally stresses the technology\nadvance in the first generation of envisioned products,\nthereby defining the bounds of the technology model that\nwill be validated, the range of products that can safely be\ndeveloped by using that model, and the conditions over\nwhich the technology is guaranteed to perform as predicted\nby the model. In the example above, while the technology\nadvance was defined as a method of rapidly testing COTS\nhardware and a middleware layer to determine the error\nhandling capability of the system, the relevant environment\nwas defined as the computing environment; more specifi-\ncally the computing system architecture, the application\nsoftware, the real-time requirements of the spacecraft sys-\ntem, and the radiation environment that produced the max-\nimum fault rate and the expected worst-case error set in the\n\n21 Technology Management 615\n\n\n\nfirst generation of computing systems that would use the\ntechnology being developed. In this case, thermal,\nmechanical, and electrical environments were not relevant,\nas these were well-known and well-understood factors that\nwere not stressing to this technology advance. Similarly,\ncompilers and software development tools were not relevant,\nas they constituted well-understood components that, while\nnecessary, were not stressing to the technology. Clearly\nunderstanding and defining the relevant environment\u2014and\nobtaining agreement of the same from both upper manage-\nment and potential adopters\u2014focuses the technology vali-\ndation, facilitates its efficient management, and forestalls a\nmyriad of questions about the technology adoption and use.\nWhile there are many factors that must be considered in\ndeciding to adopt a technology, defining the relevant envi-\nronment keeps the development team from having to address\nthem all on a continual basis, thereby smoothing and\nstreamlining both the development and the infusion process.\n\n21.11.5 Other Technical and Programmatic\nManagement Considerations\n\nObtaining funding and subsequently developing a technol-\nogy through TRL 3 (the early technology development\nphase) is relatively straightforward; it is usually inexpensive\nand funding a task to this level does not constitute a sig-\nnificant risk to upper level management. Technologists can\noften execute this early phase with minimal attention to\nformal documentation, a rigorous technology model, the\nrelevant environment, or verification and validation of the\ntechnology. At this stage the team need not be overly\nconcerned with the eventual productization requirements of\nthe technology adopters, or the rigors of technology infu-\nsion into real-world systems.\n\nTransitioning to TRL 4\u20136 (the middle technology\ndevelopment phase) however, requires transforming the\ndevelopment team from \u2018wild-eyed technologists\u2019 to \u2018hard-\nnosed product developers\u2019. This transition is accompanied\nby higher levels of rigor; i.e. formal documentation, test\nmethodology verification and validation, and attention to\nthe envisioned product and system infusion path. Issues of\nmanufacturability, testability, robustness, and ease of use\nbecome the focus in the latter half of this phase. It is at this\nstage that the task manager must help the team to cope with\nthe internal pressures of comingling two very diverse cul-\ntures: those of the technology developer and the product\nengineer.\n\nInternal frictions from the forced marriage of these two\ndiverse\u2014and in some ways opposed\u2014cultures are inevita-\nble and need to be carefully managed. At the intellectual\nlevel, education by acknowledging the respective strengths\n\nand complementary natures of these two cultures can help\nto ease tensions. At the working level, socializing and\nencouraging common activities inside and outside the work\nenvironment can encourage the team members to see each\nother as individuals, rather than as \u2018one of those people\u2019.\nThe importance of this type of activity should not be\nunderestimated. As an example, some years ago one of the\nauthors joined a small technology company where the\nfabrication process development and the manufacturing\narms of the company were at odds\u2014to the point of not\nspeaking with\u2014the design engineering arm. After observ-\ning the situation for several weeks, one day the author\nbrought in bagels and set them down in a \u2018neutral\u2019 con-\nference room adjacent to the CEO\u2019s office, while asking the\nexecutive secretary to inform the technical staff that there\nwere snacks in the conference room. This was done every\nTuesday for several weeks. After a short time, conversation\nbetween the two sides became common, people spoke of\nnon-work topics, and tensions were greatly eased. Tuesday\nbagels became a company tradition, continuing long after\nthe author departed, and they continued to perform the\nfunction of allowing the staff to see each other as cowork-\ners, rather than as hostile members of another tribe.\n\nSetting milestones can also be used to help meld the\nteam. Having the task manager define requirements such as\nthe creation of detailed specifications, test procedures, test\nreports, and then explain what is required and why, helps\nthe technologists to understand the need for the increased\nrigor and attention to detail contributed by the product\ndevelopment engineer. Meanwhile, as test, development,\nand debugging activities continue, the product development\nengineer will see the expertise and rapid analysis capability\ncontributed by the technologist. The complementarity of\ntheir respective talents is thereby revealed and is able to be\nappreciated by the other side.\n\nDuring this transition, upper management will also start to\npay significantly more attention to establishing and achiev-\ning metrics and milestones, and pressure begins to mount on\nthe team and on the task manager both from above and from\nwithin. The task manager, at this point, needs to buffer the\nteam from upper management pressure while continuing to\nlead the team through the transition and refocus them on the\nnew priorities. Keeping the team buffered from upper man-\nagement pressure does not mean that the team is to be kept\nignorant of upper management concerns, but rather that those\nconcerns be communicated at the most propitious time; in\nfact, it is often beneficial to inform the team of these concerns\nand of the management\u2019s increased interest in the develop-\nment activities. This awareness can be utilized to motivate\nand instill in the team a feeling of both importance and\nurgency in the work to achieve the next milestone. It can also\nbe used to promote team bonding, i.e., to create a common\nconcern between the members of the two constituent team\n\n616 G. L. Davis et al.\n\n\n\ncultures mentioned earlier. The manager\u2019s job is to utilize the\nincreased attention from upper management, but to not allow\nit to create a highly stressing environment that saps the\nteam\u2019s creativity, innovation, and energy.\n\nUp to this point, the \u2018people\u2019 side of the technology\nmanager\u2019s job has been discussed. It is now time to turn to\nthe more technical, \u2018process\u2019 side of the management\nfunction. Because the technology development task is\nbreaking new ground, the success of the task with respect to\nschedule and cost cannot be guaranteed. There is a need,\nhowever, to maintain a reasonable schedule and budget plan\nin order to keep the confidence of upper management and to\nensure the continuity of the funding. At the outset it is also\nimportant to communicate the risks and uncertainties to\nupper management, as well as to instill confidence that\nthese can be managed. Many of the strategies used for\ndealing with the technical issues of meeting quantitative\nscientific or engineering goals are the same as those for\ndealing with the programmatic issues of staying on budget\nand schedule. A technology task manager can profitably\napply the following techniques.\n1. Define a milestone schedule and development plan that\n\nincreases the level of formality and imposes more rigor\nin the technology development as the team climbs the\nTRL ladder.\nThe formality and rigor required in documenting test\nprocedures, test results, and analyses are much higher at\nTRL 6 than at TRL 4. Define what is needed at each\nTRL level, and let the team know what is expected of\nthem as the technology matures. An attendant effect of\nthe increased development rigor will be increased\nimpacts to cost, schedule, and risk. Upper management\nneeds to be reminded that maturing technology implies\ngreater probability of eventual success but at greater\ncost; conversely, for the early TRL stage, where there is\ngreater risk that an unforeseen problem will scuttle the\neffort, less mature technology implies lower probability\nof success but at lower cost.\n\n2. Delineate the technical risks in the technology devel-\nopment approach and create a risk management plan\nwith predetermined de-scoping options.\nIt is of paramount importance for the technology man-\nager to identify and manage risk. For each risk, define (1)\nthe impact of the risk, (2) a mitigation strategy, (3) a\nmilestone at which the risk will be assessed, (4) the\ncriteria by which the assessment will be made, and (5)\nthe action to be taken if the risk is realized. Track these\nrisks on a monthly basis, evaluating their probability and\nre-planning if necessary as the task progresses. Keep the\nteam aware of the risk plan, looking out for unantici-\npated risks and encourage them to report new findings\nthat could adversely impact the risk assessment and plan.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to update the plan and share the updates\n\nwith the team as well as with upper management. Fur-\nthermore, clearly define the budget and schedule impacts\nof the risk mitigation plan, as well as the technical\nramifications of activating the \u2018fall back plan\u2019. Making\nthis plan early in the task takes the guesswork and the\nemotion out of the process, and is the sign of a mature\ntechnology task manager: it signals to upper manage-\nment that the task is well managed and creates confi-\ndence in the team.\n\n3. Have status and planning reviews on a regular basis to\nkeep the management and the team informed.\nIn addition to the obvious fact that everyone likes to be\ninformed, frequent status reviews help to ensure that\nissues and concerns are caught early\u2014before they turn\ninto serious problems\u2014and do not surprise any stake-\nholders. Have status meetings at least monthly with\nupper management and at least weekly with the team; if\npart of the team is off-site, plan to visit them in person at\nleast monthly, or if practicable, have the entire team\nmeeting at their site periodically. As a matter of course,\nreview the milestone schedule, the budget, the risk\nmanagement plan, and recent progress against the task\nobjectives.\n\n21.11.6 Intellectual Property\n\nIt is critical for any technology organization that employs\nknowledge workers to identify and protect its intellectual\nproperty (IP), as well as to reward its employees for their\ninnovations.\n\nTraditionally, engineering notebooks, supplied and col-\nlected by the organization for archiving, are used to ensure\nthat innovations developed over the course of the job are\ndocumented in a manner that is legally useful in future IP\ndisputes. This practice should be mandated. In addition, it\nwould behoove the organization to also have a computer-\nbased system that allows technologists and engineers to\nquickly and easily note their innovations on-line, enabling\nmanagement to catalog them and follow up as appropriate.\nManagement should not only make their knowledge workers\naware of these systems and encourage their use, but also\nwork to persuade employees that documenting their inno-\nvations is of value to their careers and to the organization. In\na similar vein, management should recognize and reward the\ninventor if the submission results in any type of IP protection\naction, e.g., patent application, copyright, identification as\ntrade secret, or the like. Awards can be tangible, such as\npercentage of total royalty fees received by the organization\nfrom the invention, or intangible, such as a special desig-\nnation of \u2018Chief\u2019, \u2018Principal\u2019 or \u2018Fellow\u2019 in the inventor\u2019s\njob title, or a combination of the two, but regardless should\nbe distributed in a manner that is commensurate with the\n\n21 Technology Management 617\n\n\n\nvalue of the innovation to the organization. It is perhaps even\nmore important that lesser value submissions be acknowl-\nedged and recognized: as mentioned previously, recognizing\nand rewarding inventors across the organization results in a\nfocus on innovation, an awareness of the organization\u2019s need\nto innovate in order to compete and succeed in the market\nplace, and a willingness to go the \u2018extra mile\u2019 to create new\nand exciting technology and products.\n\nAcknowledgments The authors would like to express their gratitude\nto Carolee Kurta and Georg Siebes for their careful review of this\nmanuscript.

Menrad and George W. Morrow\n\nA project may have many forms\u2014so many, in fact, that one\nmay easily become confused when talking about them. So\nwe must agree on what is meant when using the word\n\u2018project\u2019 and state how we use the term in this chapter so\nthat it is clear how a particular process, technique, or con-\nsideration discussed here applies to your real-world activity.\n\nThe Project Management Institute defines a project as a\ntemporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product,\nservice, or result [1]. Other definitions essentially convey\nthe same meaning: an activity that results in an end-item\ndeliverable, having a fixed beginning and a defined end.\nAlthough the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-\ntion (NASA) employs the word project, other organizations\nin the USA use \u2018program\u2019 for the same activity. In this\nchapter, we will use the term \u2018project\u2019 and our agreed-upon\ndefinition, but we still need to discuss the specific kind of\nproject to focus on. Although many projects are active at\nany given time, not all are the same. Some are straightfor-\nward while others are intricate and vast. Some require little\nfunding while others require multiple years of high-level\nfunding to sustain them. And some benefit from stable\nrequirements while others undergo significant revision\nduring their lifetime, perhaps even rendering them unrec-\nognizable from the original vision. The best way to measure\nand describe these differences uses the concept of \u2018com-\nplexity\u2019. Simply put, some projects are more complex than\nothers. For more than 50 years NASA\u2019s Goddard Space\nFlight Center (GSFC) has specialized in project manage-\nment for robotic scientific missions spanning the entire\nspectrum of complexity. With about 300 completed mis-\nsions and one Nobel Prize for Physics [2], the project\nmanagers at GSFC recognize that similarities in definition\n\nand activities only go so far and that, thanks to complexity,\nthere is no short-cut or single recipe for success.\n\nWhat is the project manager\u2019s job? The authors have had\nthe good fortune to know many excellent project managers,\nand each brings different strengths and skills to a project.\nOne of the most experienced is Henry P. \u2018Hank\u2019 Wong.\nHank has seen a lot of projects from the leader\u2019s perspective\nwhile working in national defense, private sector, and civil\nspace projects. Most applicable to the GSFC environment is\nhis experience as a member of the first-generation NASA\ncommunity involved in major programs, including Apollo\nand Skylab. This experience has resulted in the simplest\ndefinition for a project manager we\u2019ve heard to date. As\nHank puts it, the project manager\u2019s job is \u2018Getting work\ndone through people\u2019. Notice that it is not building a\nspacecraft, bringing a new technology online, or meeting\nbudgets and schedules but managing people in order to\nachieve these goals. No single perspective addresses all\nfacets of this position, but relationship-building clearly is a\nhuge part of the role.\n\nThis definition sounds so simple that it appears almost\ntoo easy, but that is where the simplicity ends. Within any\naerospace organization, teams of people are working on\nprojects of varying complexity. Examples include compo-\nnent, box, subsystem, system, and \u2018systems of systems\u2019.\nTechnology and space flight projects are sure to have many\nlevels active at the same time. Yet, some will be successful,\nsome will fail, and no two will be identical in their\nexecution.\n\nThis chapter does not focus solely on a generic project\u2019s\ninternal characteristics because many project management\ntexts cover this perspective. Nor does it focus on the\ninternal characteristics of a technology project\u2014the activity\nintended to develop a key new function or capability.\nRather, it focuses on the relationship between a space flight\nproject and a technology project. This critical relationship\nmeans to combine mission-validated capabilities with as yet\nunproven technologies in a way that results in a fully\n\nR. J. Menrad (&) ? G. W.

Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014\n\n619\n\n\n\noperational system ready for launch. GSFC\u2019s approach to\nprojects for space flight missions will be the context for this\nexamination. We know people in other environments may\napply this relationship differently, but its underlying char-\nacteristics remain intact. Once a project manager and a\ntechnologist recognize these characteristics, their relation-\nship matures and strengthens because of their increased\nawareness of one another\u2019s unique perspectives and needs.\nThis awareness results in more accurate communication,\nwhich further supports the relationship, and the cycle con-\ntinues to mature as it builds on itself. In this chapter we\nintend to define a recipe for a successful relationship\nbetween the project manager and the technologist\u2014one that\ncan span the spectrum of cultural norms, unique project\nattributes, and diversity associated with people who make\nup these two respective projects.\n\n22.1 Project Types: Defining the Context\n\nAt any given time, many projects are underway within\norganizations that develop technologies\u2014pure and applied\nresearch and development (R&D)\u2014and apply them to\nobtain a suite of measurements from space-based assets. A\ntechnology-development activity is called the \u2018technology\nproject\u2019. Similarly, organizations involved in space-borne\nmissions can have a significant number of \u2018space flight\nprojects\u2019 active at the same time. Examples are\n\u2022 Producing identical vehicles on an assembly line, such as\n\nconstellations of identical satellites.\n\u2022 Creating high-heritage vehicles with low-risk updates to\n\nsubsystems, such as operational satellites.\n\u2022 Developing high-risk, \u2018first-of-a-kind\u2019 applications of a\n\ndetector, subsystem, or system, such as flagship science\nsatellites.\n\nIn this chapter, we focus on the global perspective\u2014\nemphasizing how the technology project\u2019s manager and the\nspace flight project\u2019s manager interact. From our experi-\nence, this is the seminal relationship between these two\n\nproject types. It determines whether the original space flight\nproject\u2019s baseline will incorporate the technology or keep it\non the project when challenges occur. Figure 22.1 illustrates\nthe fundamental relationship between technology and space\nflight projects. It describes each project\u2019s perspective, not\nhow to do technology development.\n\nA technology project has unique characteristics. In the\nsimplest terms, it develops a \u2018product\u2019 intended to carry out\na function or requirement. This can be a new piece part,\nsuch as a field programmable gate array (FPGA); a com-\nponent, such as a detector; or a box or subsystem, such as\nion propulsion. It can be a new approach for connecting\nvarious units to create more efficient interfaces, such as fiber\noptic data harnesses. The typical process is to conceive,\ninvent, and improve the product over time, which normally\nresults in updated versions or newer \u2018models\u2019 being released\nperiodically. Each newer version usually represents some\ncombination of corrections to errors in the previously\nreleased versions, new functions such as increased com-\nputing speed, added memory, or reduced power consump-\ntion, and increased reliability by applying better parts, more\nconservative de-rating strategies, or improved software and\nfirmware.\n\nWe can measure the product\u2019s maturation using scales\nsuch as the technology readiness level (TRL) [3]; TRLs,\nalong with key discriminators and exit criteria, are sum-\nmarized in Table 21.1 and Fig. 2.10. For private-sector\nprojects, we may protect the product using patents or other\nlegal instruments in order to control its availability. When\nthe product\u2019s value is high enough, we may apply national\nprotection measures to prevent disclosing it or revealing its\nunderlying design principles.\n\nAs the technology under development usually represents\none aspect of a capability or function, the technology pro-\nject has implicit limitations that the technologist must\naddress. Most notably, the product being produced\u2014no\nmatter how impressive\u2014typically cannot fly into space on\nits own.

Morrow\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_21\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_2\n\n\nBy contrast, the space flight project\u2019s responsibility is\ntypically the collection of data of interest to a specific\ncommunity. This community may be policy makers, sci-\nentists, or defense agencies. In some cases, they will not\ndirectly care how this data is collected; in others, such as for\nthe science community, they will be keenly interested. So\nthe space flight project is interested in applying technology\nin order to assemble an end-to-end system. This system\nmust be able to survive a space flight mission of known\nduration, under extreme environmental conditions, while\ntaking accurate measurements for a predefined period\n(usually years). Whereas the technology project is interested\nin maturing a technology through periodic release of ever-\nbetter versions, the space flight project wishes to hold to a\ndiscrete engineering design that has been fully integrated\nand then expressed in terms of measurable cost, schedule,\nand risk. The technology project\u2019s product is but one part of\nthat discrete design. When a space flight project decides to\napply a newer, immature technology, the development\ncycles needed to mature the technology must take place\nwithin a prescribed period, and that is a source of risk to\ncost, schedule, or requirements. Due to this risk, the space\nflight project manager is biased to seek out the most mature\ntechnologies available, except when the space flight mission\nintends to support the technology\u2019s development itself.\n\nAs the technology generated must be integrated into the\nspace flight project\u2019s baseline plan, a technologist must\neither participate in a space flight mission whose express\npurpose is to fly the technology, or find a mission that will\n\nincorporate it. In the first instance, technologists can drive\nthe mission\u2019s definition. In the second, they must ensure that\nthe community of space flight mission developers is aware of\nthe technology\u2019s benefits at each point along its evolutionary\npathway. They also must recognize that the technologist\u2019s\ndefinition of \u2018maturity\u2019 is rarely the same as that of the\nproject manager for space flight missions, and some part of\nthe resources dedicated to the technology product\u2019s devel-\nopment must be diverted to the space flight project\u2019s needs.\nProject managers for space flight missions have the unique\nburden of ensuring that the technology community knows\nabout the mission\u2019s opportunities. The project manager must\ntake advantage of technology forums that inform potential\nusers on the products becoming available for use. This last\naspect is key to the strategic communication approach\nemployed by NASA\u2019s Earth Science Technology Office\n(ESTO). Ultimately, we are examining the vastly different\nperspectives for technologists and space flight project\nmanagers, as shown in Figs. 22.2 and 22.3. The two man-\nagers must understand that both sides of this relationship are\nessential if they are to communicate effectively with each\nother and develop a successful collaboration.\n\nTechnology projects exist to satisfy requirements that are\nimposed by stakeholders or are specified when the tech-\nnology is integrated into other projects. The latter might\n\u2018improve on\u2019 a product to fully exploit a technique, meet\nanticipated requirements of a future series of flight projects,\nor mature a proof of concept to allow developers to sub-\nsequently apply it with reasonable risk.

Usually, though, maturation translates into successive\nversions of a product, with each new version having\nincreased performance or functionality. By contrast, the\nflight project applies technology at a given state of devel-\nopment or with controlled further development. Technolo-\ngists and project managers must avoid the natural desire to\nfly the most up to date version of the product possible. In\nshort, everyone involved with the project must remember\nthe mantra: \u2018Better is the enemy of good enough!\u2019\n\nThe rest of this chapter will shine a flight-mission\nspotlight on the relationship between the technology project\nmanager and the space flight project manager while carry-\ning out a space flight project. We intend to increase the\nrespective communities\u2019 awareness of the different\nperspectives, needs, and approaches in order that they\ncan collaborate more effectively. For the perspective of the\ntechnology project manager and project team, see Chap. 21.\n\n22.2 Project Management: An Overview\n\nAs we begin to analyze the relationship between technolo-\ngists and space flight project managers, we must establish\ncommon project-management principles. To do this, we\nwill review their basics and then offer a new model for\nunderstanding how to carry out this critical competency.\nEveryone manages something, regardless of where he or she\nworks on a project.\n\n22.2.1 Understand Key Terms for Project\nManagement\n\nMany good textbooks are available on project management\n[4\u20136], but it is still useful to define basic principles.\n\u2022 A project\u2014Because the United States\u2019 military space\n\ncommunity refers to this limited activity as a program,\nwe\u2019ll apply NASA\u2019s distinction between project and\nprogram in this chapter. A NASA project is an activity\nwith a specific purpose and assigned start and stop dates.\nA NASA program is a collection of discrete projects with\nno explicit start and stop times.\n\n\u2022 Project team\u2014A collection of individuals, each repre-\nsenting a different competency, working together to\ncomplete the steps necessary to conceive, design,\ndevelop, test, and operate a space flight mission. Typi-\ncally, this team includes project management, systems\nengineering, other engineering disciplines, safety or\nmission assurance, and project support.\n\n\u2022 Project manager\u2014The one person assigned overall\nresponsibility for carrying out a project. This is a posi-\ntion, not the practice of project management. As an\nexample, a generic flight project at GSFC can have at\nleast six positions with the word \u2018manager\u2019 in their titles.\nAs the project continues, each of these managers will\npractice project management but not to the same scope,\ncomplexity, or responsibility as that of the project man-\nager. This is a crucial distinction. Project management\noccurs in many places, but only one person is responsible\nfor the entire activity.\n\nProject \nManager\n\nEngineering\n\nResearch & \nDevelopment Integration Manufacturing\n\nTechnology Project\n\nProject \nManager\n\nSystems \nEngineer\n\nPayload \nManager\n\nSpacecraft \nManager\n\nGround System \nManager\n\nFlight-Mission Project 2\n\nProject \nManager\n\nEngineering\n\nResearch & \nDevelopment Integration Manufacturing\n\nTechnology Project\n\nProject \nManager\n\nEngineering\n\nResearch & \nDevelopment Integration Manufacturing\n\nTechnology Project\n\nFig. 22.3 Perspective of the\nspace flight project manager.

Morrow\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_21\n\n\n\u2022 Project phase\u2014A collection of logically related project\nactivities, usually culminating in a major deliverable or\nmilestone.\n\n\u2022 Key decision point (KDP)\u2014The event at which the\ndecision authority determines a project\u2019s readiness to\nprogress to the next phase or series of activities.\n\n\u2022 Formulation\u2014The phase in which a project\n\u2013 Develops a workable mission concept that would meet\n\nstakeholders\u2019 technical, cost, and schedule require-\nments with acceptable risk\n\n\u2013 Assesses feasibility, technology, and concepts\n\u2013 Assesses risk, builds teams, and develops operations\n\nconcepts and acquisition strategies\n\u2013 Establishes high-level requirements and success crite-\n\nria, including life cycle cost and end-to-end schedule.\n\u2022 Implementation\u2014Carrying out the space flight mission\u2019s\n\nstakeholder-approved baseline plan (the formulated pro-\nject) as specified in requirements, budget, schedule, and\nrisk terms.\n\n22.2.2 Limit Overlapping Project\nResponsibilities\n\nAs the science of project management has become more\nformal and wide-spread, sometimes role inflation has taken\nplace. This is most common between the project manager\nand the mission systems engineer\u2014when the latter\u2019s per-\nceived scope extends into that normally reserved to the\nproject manager. This confusion in roles can also occur\nbetween the technologist and the space flight project man-\nager. Boards investigating mishaps have identified unclear\nroles and responsibilities as a contributing factor in acci-\ndents, so space-based missions must limit the effects of\norganizational complexities, such as role inflation. Once a\nflight mission intends to integrate a technology, individuals\nand teams must understand the clearly specified relationship\nbetween the technologist and the space flight project man-\nager. Otherwise, strained relationships may challenge the\ncollaboration, possibly even causing on-orbit failure.\n\n22.2.3 Understand Project Management\nFrameworks\n\nThe Encarta Dictionary of English (North America) defines\na framework as \u2018\u2018a set of ideas, principles, agreement, or\nrules that provides the basis or outline for something to be\nmore fully developed at a later stage.\u2019\u2019 Therefore, a\nframework is the construct by which work is done. Project\nmanagement has several formal frameworks, as well as\n\ninformal ones based on the cultural norms by which the\nwork is done. Formal frameworks are proliferating, but we\nwill mention five common ones here.\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nProgram/Project Framework\u2014NASA\u2019s Office of the Chief\nEngineer has created policy and guidance intended to\nstandardize the activities for programs and projects across\nthe five space centers and four research centers. This\nframework is specified in NASA Procedural Requirements,\n7120.5e [7].\n\nProject Management Institute (PMI?) Body of Knowl-\nedge (PMBOK?)\u2014The PMI is based in the United States\nand has developed a project-management framework codi-\nfied in the PMBOK and representing a generic 5-phase\nproject. PMI is a non-profit organization dedicated to\ndeveloping standards and guidelines. Its involvement spans\nresearch, continuing education, and publication of a maga-\nzine containing project-management topics. In addition,\nPMI has sanctioned strategies to ease networking through\nlocal charters, conferences, and training seminars. The\ngeneric project framework described in the PMBOK? is the\nfoundation for a certification program. Practitioners earn the\ncertificate by satisfying education requirements, gaining on-\nthe-job experience, and passing a written exam. They\nmaintain certification by meeting requirements for contin-\nuing education.\n\nU.S. Department of Defense, Defense Acquisition\nFramework\u2014The United States\u2019 Department of Defense\n(DoD) has developed its own Defense Acquisition Frame-\nwork (DAF) to complement the private sector\u2019s PMBOK. It\nprovides consolidated guidance and best practices for pro-\nject managers who manage projects under the Defense\nAcquisition System. This system exists to manage the\nnation\u2019s investments in technologies, programs, and product\nsupport needed to achieve the National Security Strategy\nand support the United States Armed Forces [8].\n\nPRojects IN Controlled Environments (PRINCE2?)\u2014\nThe PRINCE2 framework navigates project managers\nthrough all the essentials for running a successful project, as\ndefined by the chartered organization. By design, PRINCE2\ncan be tailored to the needs of various projects. As with the\nPMI PMBOK, PRINCE2 is a generic \u2018best practice\u2019 tool.\nGovernment agencies in the United Kingdom and\nthroughout Europe use it extensively as the recognized\nproject-management standard.\n\nInternational Project Management Association (IPMA)\u2014\nThe IPMA is a federation of project-management organiza-\ntions based in Switzerland and chartered to promote inter-\nnational management while distributing common guidelines\nand standards across countries. This effort is important\nbecause the number of multi-national projects continues to\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 623\n\n\n\ngrow, as does the number of participant countries. The IPMA\nalso seeks to establish professional standards and guidelines\nfor project managers. This framework also contains a certi-\nfication option.\n\n22.2.3.1 Recognize What Frameworks Are\nand Are Not\n\nA certificate is not a license to practice. As project managers\nlead increasingly complex projects, their proficiency must\nalso increase. However, knowledge and certification, though\nlaudable, are not the same as proficiency, which depends\nmostly on experience. Supervisors or decision authorities\nmainly use proficiency to assign project managers to projects\nthat are more complex. After all the time and effort that is\ninvested to become certified, however, it is easy to under-\nstand why managers might be confused about this issue.\n\nFrameworks available worldwide are not projects, but\nthey are very valuable to project management. They at least\nprovide an excellent point of departure for a diverse project\nteam who must begin by transitioning a generic process into\na specific project. As long as practitioners are referencing\nthe same framework, they can effectively communicate\nexpectations using standardized terms, predefined best\npractices, documented attributes of completeness, and rec-\nommended tool sets. However, everyone must remember\nthat no project will replicate a framework. Rather, managers\ntailor each project to meet the stakeholders\u2019 requirements,\nbudget constraints, and schedule drivers.\n\nFrameworks also are excellent yardsticks by which to\nmeasure a project\u2019s maturity. Organizations involved in\nprojects over a long time amass a valuable historical record\nof what worked and what didn\u2019t. Project management\nmaturity (PMM) is a process organizations normally use to\nevaluate a current project\u2019s maturity based on those past\nresults. As presented in Applied Project Management for\nSpace Systems [9], project managers should also be aware\nof a different approach for using PMM: regularly assessing\nthe project (perhaps after key decision points) indepen-\ndently of any organizational activities. To apply this\nexcellent practice, project managers should remember that\nframeworks contain widely agreed upon success criteria for\ntheir evaluations.\n\n22.2.4 Responsibilities of the Space Flight\nProject Manager\n\nWhy do we need a project manager? Simply put, a project\nmanager is the one person responsible for the group\u2019s efforts\nto meet stakeholders\u2019 requirements within cost and schedule\nconstraints and with acceptable residual risk. This is true\nwhether it is a technology project or a space flight project.\n\nAlthough it is very easy to say this, the challenge lies in the\nexecution. Table 22.1 illustrates many of the challenges that\na project manager can expect to lead a project through.\n\n22.2.5 Strategies in Project Management\n\nProject managers must master what can be the most difficult\npart of project management: integrating different cultural\napproaches into a single team approach within differing\nenvironments. Otherwise, even a common academic\nunderstanding of roles and responsibilities or definitions\nwill go for naught. Recognizing this challenge, organiza-\ntions have defined alternate strategies for specific instances.\nThese strategies in turn affect the project\u2019s environment. We\nexamine three below: rapid prototyping, spiral development\n(introduced in Chap. 7), and project life cycle.\n\n22.2.5.1 \u2018Rapid Prototype\u2019 Approach\nTechnology development projects share a common desire:\nto take an idea and make it reality. The team\u2019s focus is on\npure research and development. The very attributes that\nmake good technologists\u2014such as thinking \u2018outside the\nbox\u2019\u2014often make them abhor structure.\n\nA free-thinking environment is very empowering, espe-\ncially when matched with a development approach that\nallows the team to focus more on developing the technology\nand less on paperwork, configuration control, risk man-\nagement (beyond safety considerations), and so on. We are\nnot saying all technology projects are unstructured, but the\nbest ones often carry this bias. Because like-minded people\ntend to come together, this mindset is further reinforced in\nthe technology community. Consequently, project man-\nagement may become secondary to protecting the free-\nthinking approach.\n\nMany free-form projects turn to rapid prototype devel-\nopment. In its purest application, this approach enables the\nproject team to focus on developing the technology. Often\ntermed define-build-test-repeat, it applies best when devel-\nopment speed is primary. Though empowering, this\napproach is far less structured and documented than other\nstrategies, which means it may not match well when trying\nto link with those other strategies\u2014especially the ones\napplied to developing human-rated systems.\n\nSpace flight missions typically use rapid prototyping\ndifferently: the project team assembles a system \u2018right now\u2019\nto test concepts rapidly. This requires the project to employ\ncurrent technologies because it does not have time to wait\nfor a new technology to mature. In this case, the project will\noffer limited opportunity to test dramatically new technol-\nogies. Consequently, rapid prototyping normally applies to\nproduction programs.\n\n624 R. J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_7\n\n\nTable 22.1 Project challenges. Any project experiences many diverse challenges\n\nLikely challenges Brief explanation\n\nTechnical Design deficiencies Mistakes in design, analysis, or interface satisfaction discovered through\nanalysis or test\n\nComponent or subassembly generic failure\nmodes\n\nFailures requiring rework or redesign\n\nPoor performance Failure to meet performance, availability, or reliability specifications\n\nRequirements Changes in user requirements The \u2018moving target\u2019 effect: increased risk from incorrect mapping of changes\nto the baseline\n\nChanges to institutional abilities Many projects leverage multi-mission abilities such as networks, WAN/LAN,\nand data archives. Unexpected changes to the functions they support burden\nthe project\n\nDisconnects between planned versus actual\nfunctions of the technology devices\n\nThe technology plan is just a plan. When reaching a functional level takes\nlonger than planned or becomes unachievable, the project must make up the\ndifference. That will force new trades, designs, or implementation strategies.\nThis typically happens when a project adopts immature technologies and\nhopes for the best. To solve this problem, we recommend critically assessing\ntechnology maturity levels\n\nBudget Incorrect phasing across fiscal years Knowing when funds are required is just as important as knowing the funding\nlevel. Incorrect phasing of financial needs burdens the project and can\nconstrain other critical activities\n\nMid-year adjustments or changes (cuts) External drivers are a frequent source of unplanned changes that usually delay\nthe development schedule or increase risk. Categorizing the impact is critical\n\nUnplanned vendor adjustments Because vendors are project team members, mission success depends on their\nsuccess. When the business landscape changes, so do corporate expenses, such\nas rent and overhead. The project team must absorb these changes\n\nTechnology maturation activities taking\nlonger than planned\n\nThe time required to mature technologies is notoriously unpredictable. This\nmeans the project manager needs to plan for the most likely outcome, not the\npreferred one\n\nSchedule Constrained launch dates (generically,\nconstrained \u2018finish\u2019 dates)\n\nMany missions have constraints on launch, with planetary missions\nrepresenting an extreme example. This reality requires detailed planning to\nmaintain acceptable risk\n\nWorkforce furloughs Political considerations outside the project\u2019s control can strongly affect\nschedule\n\nDelays in technology maturation A delay in technology development involves more than just increased funding\nrequirements. Any delay can affect a project schedule\u2019s critical path. That\u2019s\nwhy technology shouldn\u2019t be maturing as the space flight mission develops\nunless stakeholders agree to this risk\n\nWorkforce Skills mismatched to application Space flight missions often represent \u2018one-off\u2019 applications of a unique\ntechnology. As a result the project must ensure access to specialized skills with\nenough people to make the progress assumed in the schedule\n\nOversubscribed subject matter experts Just as finding the right person can be difficult; getting adequate time from the\nexperts is a risk we must factor into the schedule\n\nAttrition The loss of any project member burdens on the remaining team members.\nAttrition can quickly affect productivity and quality, especially for the\ntechnology-development team\n\nEmployee health Employees commit themselves fully to many projects. As a result, stresses and\npressures to deliver can take a toll on their health. The project manager has to\nmanage the physical, mental, and emotional pressure as carefully as any other\naspect\n\n(continued)\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 625\n\n\n\n22.2.5.2 \u2018Spiral Development\u2019 Approach\nIn complex, multi-faceted activities with a lot of develop-\nment, especially for software, information commonly\nevolves, so we need a different approach. For known work,\nthe team applies focused, structured processes and proce-\ndures. At some predefined point in the future, they will\nbegin work on defining the next wave of development, often\nleveraging the capabilities they have already started. In this\nmodel, the project is organized consistent with the struc-\ntured needs of a space flight project but with integrated\npockets of technology development. Rather than specifying\ndiscrete incremental releases or builds, the project defines\ndevelopment stages intended to complete part of the oper-\nations concept. Spiral development is very popular for\n\u2018systems of systems\u2019 spanning multiple phases, such as\nNASA\u2019s (now defunct) Constellation Program. It sought to\nbuild systems that could deliver humans to Mars by first\ndemonstrating capabilities in low-Earth orbit, then at lunar\ndistances, followed by the actual missions to Mars.\n\n22.2.5.3 \u2018Life Cycle\u2019 Approach\nHuge \u2018systems of systems\u2019 programs are very exciting and\ncan be a major user of new technologies, but they are far\nless common. Because rapid prototyping also is less fre-\nquent, stand-alone projects are more likely.\n\nOrganizations and their stakeholders have looked at\ncollections of stand-alone projects as a \u2018portfolio\u2019 in order\nto address common strengths and weaknesses. By observing\nstrong similarities across all projects in terms of how to\nconduct them, they have been able to break up the effort\ninto a single set of discrete phases: the project life cycle.\nThis results in significant advantages for the organization,\nstakeholders, and project teams. Table 22.2 summarizes the\nadvantages of life cycle development.\n\nManagers do not universally employ a single life cycle\nmodel, but each model shares a common key attribute:\nsystematic development in which a project progresses\nthrough all of the steps that are required in order to be\nsuccessful. Figure 7.6 presents the life cycle model that\nNASA uses now [10]; it\u2019s also the fundamental approach to\nproject management at GSFC.\n\n22.2.6 Putting Project Management\ninto Practice\n\nBooks in the library and all development models on this\nsubject emphasize one fact: project management follows a\nprocess. In general, the literature tries to propose an\nimproved process, to explain an existing one better, or to\ncompare and contrast the available frameworks. More\nimportant to our context, understanding the project man-\nagement process enables technologists to communicate with\ngreater clarity and collaborate more fully with project\nmanagers of space flight missions.\n\n22.2.6.1 The Process of Project Management\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle teaches us that some\npairs of data are mutually exclusive. In its formal presenta-\ntion to a high-school physics class, the concept is illustrated\nusing position and velocity. Typically, this is done during\nthe examination of a picture of a bullet that has just been shot\nfrom a gun. In the lesson, we learn that the more we know\nabout the bullet\u2019s exact position the less we know about its\nvelocity. On the other hand, gaining velocity information for\nthe bullet means we lose information on its exact position.\nWe believe there is a corollary for mutually exclusive pairs\nof information in project management. For large-scope\nprojects\u2014those typical of space flight missions\u2014knowledge\nof the overall project (horizontal scope) and specific detailed\nknowledge of any part (vertical depth) are mutually exclu-\nsive. Simply put, the project\u2019s scale exceeds any human\u2019s\nability to know everything about everything.\n\nThis preamble prompts the question: What is a project\nmanager to do? In the experience of the authors, the great\nproject managers exhibit four key characteristics.\n\nOne: Being fully aware of horizontal scope. Project\nmanagers focus on knowing as much as possible about the\nentire project they are managing. Recognizing that they\ncannot know all the excruciating details, they focus on the\npeople through whom they get the work done.\n\nTwo: Looking over the horizon. Anyone involved in a\ncomplex task naturally focuses on that task in a way that\nexcludes all else; in effect, a form of tunnel vision. By\n\nTable 22.1 (continued)\n\nLikely challenges Brief explanation\n\nLogistics Geographically distributed team members Modern space flight projects involve participants from around the world.\nManagers must plan to bridge different cultures, time zones, and norms\n\nNatural disasters Earthquakes, tsunamis, or hurricanes represent a fraction of the environmental\nfactors that can harm a project. Although most projects can\u2019t afford to insure\nthemselves, they must account for risk in order to limit their effects\n\nNon-disclosure constraints Proprietary information constraints, national policies, or laws are examples of\nmechanisms that impede the free flow of technical information. Project plans\nmust acknowledge these impediments\n\nIn some cases the challenge can be identified early and resolved, but in others the project, led by the project manager, must react quickly and\neffectively\n\n626 R. J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_7\n\n\ncontrast, the great project managers are always examining\nthe parts of their project in a systematic, round-robin\nfashion\u2014taking a global perspective. As a result, they see\nthings that require attention sooner than would otherwise be\npossible.\n\nThree: Focusing on people as much as the work. Most\nproject managers have technical backgrounds. Their\nextensive exposure to problem-solving in school and early\ncareer positions biases them to become task-oriented.\nHowever, at some point the position becomes less about\npersonally completing a task and more about getting others\nto complete their tasks and produce certain results\n\u2022 Addressing all necessary tasks.\n\u2022 Scheduling so that completion of one task supports others\n\nthat are in progress.\n\u2022 Keeping costs for task completion within the planned\n\nbudget.\nUnfortunately, these skills form a much smaller part of\nformal training and early work experience. This is why\nleadership is such a challenging\u2014and critical\u2014element in a\n\nproject manager\u2019s career development. Again, it comes\ndown to getting work done through people.\n\nFour: Knowing the difference between good and great.\nProject management is not easy, especially for space flight\nmissions. We have often told our teams that one cannot do\nthis work without experiencing the proverbial \u2018fire\u2019\u2014but\nwe just want a hose on every fire! So what is the difference\nbetween \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018great\u2019 when it comes to project man-\nagers in this kind of environment? The great ones know\nwhen to ask for advice or help!\n\nHabits are hard to break, and project managers begin as\ndiscipline engineers, move to systems engineering, and\neventually begin to manage projects. Therefore, project\nmanagers cannot assume they will have the same experi-\nence-based intuition in all of the project areas that they are\nexpected to manage. This normally is not a problem until\nthe trouble starts. When facing difficulties, we gravitate\ntoward areas we know the most about. Further, we believe\nwe can contribute best by identifying the root cause of a\nproblem and then defining the best solution to address it. At\n\nTable 22.2 Advantages of the life cycle model\n\nAdvantage Brief explanation\n\nProject Known expectations Understanding the driving expectations on a project allows for more\nrealistic planning, which in turn reduces risk and stress on the team\n\nRecipe for success Less experienced projects now have a mission-validated method for\ncompleting the work\n\nExisting tools and procedures Because work products for a specific life cycle phase are predefined,\nprevious projects have developed the tools to support the them. This\nreduces the burden on the team to create new tools from scratch\n\nOrganization,\nsuch as hosting\nentity\n\nCaptured experience Because the life cycle is based upon past efforts, organizations benefit\nfrom a proven method for doing the work. Thus, they can focus more\non the unique drivers for this mission\n\nScale for evaluating progress With a single life cycle model each project is evaluated in terms of its\nmaturity using the same criteria. This approach reduces ambiguity and\nallows organizations to identify issues sooner than would otherwise be\npossible\n\nCommon \u2018language\u2019 across all projects A single approach translates into a cultural norm for how to complete\nthe work. This in turn allows sharing across projects, leveraging\nexperience and perspectives to benefit all\n\nCommon framework for evaluating overall\nperformance, such as project management\nmaturity\n\nWith a common framework, organizations can evaluate their overall\nperformance across many projects and use the results to adjust\npersonnel-development strategies, tools, and expectations\n\nStakeholders,\nsuch as an\nAgency\n\nCommonality across all sources With a common framework, stakeholders can leverage multiple\nsources more effectively and evaluate performance more accurately\n\nUniversal statement of expectations in\nactionable terms\n\nHigher-order activities, such as policy definition and garnering of\npolitical support, can now rely on a known set of work products having\na given focus and level of detail\n\nSimplified insight and oversight Oversight of an increased number of projects conducted by an\nincreased number of vendors becomes more efficient\n\nMost accurate context for evaluating risk With a common framework in effect, it\u2019s now easier to evaluate risks\nto program elements such as budget or schedule\n\nA singular structured approach to projects results in benefits at every level\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 627\n\n\n\nthe same time, we may make the huge mistake of turning\naway from problems in areas we know less about. Project\nmanagers must evenly distribute their time across all project\nareas in order to keep a finger on the project\u2019s pulse; and,\nsometimes, to keep their jobs.\n\n22.2.6.2 Why Projects Fail\nEach time we embark on a project, we accept the risk of\nfailure. By nature, a project manager is an optimist\u2014willing\nto expend the effort required to overcome the risks in\nbringing the mission concept to fruition. However, despite\nthe best efforts of those involved, projects do fail. Organi-\nzations, stakeholders, and academics have written many\nstudies attempting to explain why this occurs.\n\nAll projects have a built-in bias for failure. Although\nmany factors are at play, our experience shows that the key\ndriver is the very optimism that prompts people to under-\ntake these challenges in the first place. Optimism abounds\non how long it will take to do the work, the stability of the\nbudget or project team, and the requirements of the project.\nIn fact, we are biased toward optimism in every underlying\nassumption that we are required to make when moving\nthrough life cycle phases.\n\nYet, complexity is as much a driver as optimism, if not\nmore so, for why projects fail. This should not come as a\nsurprise. Intelligent people typical of our community have\ndeveloped grand visions for what is possible because of\nreadily available computing power and today\u2019s sophisti-\ncated computer-based engineering applications. They may\npay too much attention to maturing the project\u2019s individual\ntechnologies but too little to maturing the final flight system\nacross all life cycle phases. Take NASA\u2019s original design\nfor the International Space Station. It employed a double\nkeel that was as grand in its vision during the conceptual\nphase as it was possible to \u2018engineer\u2019 using the computer\nmodels available at the time. Later, it became questionable\nwhether the number of astronauts needed to maintain this\nversion in orbit could be accommodated aboard the facility.\n\nWe use this example because it is straightforward and\neasily recognizable as an instance of complexity exceeding\ncapability. Alas, in too many cases, the consequences of\ncomplexity are not so readily apparent. Table 22.3 presents\nsome sources of complexity that project managers must factor\ninto their plans. We want to provide a richer understanding of\nwhat project planning must take into account\u2014the very phase\nwhen a technologist wants to influence the project the most. In\naddition, project managers often inherit an already formu-\nlated project, which means they had little to say about the way\na project was set up. This list of complexity sources can help\nyou, as a newly assigned project manager, in your first\nassessment at leading a project.\n\n22.2.6.3 The \u2018BEER Model\u2019: A New Perspective\nfor Success\n\nProject managers need tools that make it easier to practice\ntheir craft. Many textbooks spend a lot of pages on what\nproject management \u2018is\u2019 and others spend pages on meth-\nods. However, the \u2018BEER Model\u2019 captures the essence of\nproject management, as we have observed it over many\ninstances.\n\nOne antidote for project complexity is \u2018completeness\u2019.\nBy paying proper attention to all aspects of a project in both\nthe scope and time domains, project managers increase the\nlikelihood that their project teams are similarly paying\nappropriate attention. This action alone will not eliminate\nthe risks, but it can greatly reduce them.\n\nThen what is the project manager to focus on? What\nrepresents \u2018complete\u2019 attention to the project? How can we\norganize these activities so they make intuitive sense? The\ntextbook Applied Project Management for Space Systems\n[11] addressed some of these questions. The unique group\nof practitioners and educators who edited this text recog-\nnized that they could aggregate most project manager core\ncompetencies into four discrete actions aligned with\nbehavior. Specifically, project managers need to \u2018Bound\u2019\nthe project in ways that ensure completeness but don\u2019t\nexceed the stakeholders\u2019 needs, as codified in the require-\nments. They need to address the processes, procedures, and\ntechniques needed to \u2018Execute\u2019 all required activities, as\nwell as \u2018Enable\u2019 project team members to leverage their\nexperience in ways that will make the whole team suc-\ncessful. Finally, and equally important, project managers\nmust be willing and disciplined enough to \u2018Reassess\u2019 how\nthe project team is performing\u2014not on a specific task or\nseries of tasks, but as that performance affects the project\nglobally. When project managers think this way, they can\nsee the project not just as a participant but also as its leader.\nTable 22.4 illustrates the BEER Model.\n\n22.3 Project Management: A Collaborative\nApproach to Project Execution\n\nSpace flight projects are often large, visible, complex, and\nprone to failure. From the Goddard Space Flight Center\u2019s\nperspective, they\u2019re almost always one-time builds con-\nducted under schedule and budget pressures, with probing\nstakeholders and managers often asking for status and\noffering solutions. To overcome these external and internal\nchallenges, a project team becomes close and, if the project\nmanager is successful, takes on a common persona that\nunifies them. Likewise, technology project teams are groups\nof people bound together by the common vision of\n\n628 R. J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\n\n\ndeveloping something new and then seeing it flown suc-\ncessfully. They also develop their own persona. How they\nwork together strongly influences any collaborative effort\u2019s\nultimate success. The key to success is in how each team\nsees the other. The technology team should not consider the\nspace flight project as a means to an end, nor should the\nspace flight project consider the technology team a miracle\ncure for a poorly defined project. To integrate these teams\nsuccessfully, each manager must understand the other\u2019s\nproject (Table 22.5).\n\nOutside GSFC, some projects focus on production builds\nor other applications of similar complexity. Although this\nproduction setting and GSFC\u2019s one-of-a-kind environment\nhave inherent differences, they also have similarities, such\nas inserting technology updates or new technologies into\ndevelopment. An excellent example is the satellite phone\nindustry, which excels in mass-producing flight systems that\nevolve with new technologies. In any case, the relationships\nlinking technologists and project managers must work well\nin any environment.\n\nTable 22.3 Sources of project complexity\n\nTypes of complexities Potential impact\n\nTechnical Scope (such as system of systems) Scope drives the infrastructure of the process in terms of requirements\ntraceability, configuration management, risk assessment, and so on\n\nTechnology application Using technologies not originally envisioned with the application can\ncause complexity that can span hardware and software\n\nCommercial off the shelf (COTS) applications While offering an immediate savings, COTS issues include licensing, IT\nsecurity implications, integration and obsolescence\n\nSystem segmentation Systems such as ground data systems can have many elements. If we are\nnot clever in grouping these elements, we may have to manage too\nmany interfaces\n\nSoftware (flight and ground) A science in its own right, managing the architecture, modules, and\nlibraries increases the challenges of integration and maintenance\n\nHardware (flight and ground) Challenges in detector electronics are classic examples of anticipating\ncomplexity but yet underestimating its effects\n\nOrganizational Cultural norms (national and otherwise) of the\norganization in which part of the project is\nlocated\n\nEstablished formal and informal practices can drive projects to carry out\nmore activities than would be normal given the level of risk assumed to\nbe acceptable\n\nStakeholders The sheer number of stakeholders to be briefed can challenge a\nproject\u2019s ability to execute within schedule and budget assumptions\n\nVendor proliferation Having many contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers burdens\nresource managers\n\nHuman interfaces Depending on the nature of the project, the user community alone may\nbe more diverse, resulting in more representatives to meet with\nregularly. This is especially true when missions involve atypical\ncomponents, such as nuclear power subsystems\n\nResponsibilities, authorities, and accountabilities All teams require a clear definition of each member\u2019s role and\nresponsibilities. For large projects, we may need a lot of time to define\nthem and then to modify them based on performance\n\nProprietary data Protecting national and corporate proprietary data can require more\nfrom management information systems and special training for the\nproject\u2019s core members\n\nEnvironmental Weather Floods, hurricanes, or tornadoes are just some examples of events that\ncan have a long-term impact on a project. In this context we\u2019re focusing\nless on the risk of occurrence but more on the consequences of\nresolving them, such as backup control centers\n\nNatural disasters Institutional facilities\u2014such as ground stations, network hubs, and\npoints-of-presence\u2014carry data of varying priority, which means we\nneed diversity in the implementation\n\nPolitical climate Changing priorities at the national level can cause basic changes in the\nsupport for or against a project.\n\nWorking conditions Obsolete buildings, unsafe conditions (such as asbestos), or delays in\nacquiring new or modified facilities\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 629\n\n\n\nTable 22.4 The \u2018BEER Model\u2019\n\nFocus or goal Model aspects Brief explanation\n\nBound Define the project\u2019s foundation in\nterms of user needs\n\nProject capture In a competitive environment new business capture is itself a\nproject with special considerations we must account for\n\nProject planning The project plan is the focal point for project governance; it\nestablishes procedures the entire team must follow\n\nOrganizational\ndesign\n\nHow we organize our team directly affects the way members are\nempowered to carry out their assigned responsibilities\n\nStakeholder\nmanagement\n\nEvery project must correctly identify the stakeholders and how\nthey affect the project, so we can accurately apply ways of meeting\ntheir needs\n\nManagement\ninformation\nsystem\n\nWe must carefully consider the methods and systems used to\ncontrol the project\u2019s collective knowledge, especially as\ncomplexity increases\n\nExecute Assemble a project\u2019s building blocks\nto create an environment for success\n\nSystems\nengineering\n\nThe practice of bringing various disciplines together into a single,\nintegrated system that we can specify in terms of its construction,\nmargins, and performance\n\nRequirements\ntraceability\n\nThe process of defining a system in functional terms across\nmultiple levels of detail\n\nLogistics Approaches to managing the operational systems\n\nMission assurance An engineering-based discipline focusing on issues of system\nreliability, safety, and satisfying requirements\n\nLife cycle cost\nestimation\n\nThe process of estimating the funding required for a specific\nsystem of given complexity from start to finish\n\nBudgeting The process of managing a project\u2019s funds with focus on multiple\nyears of performance, cost plans versus new obligation authority,\nreserves, and resource-loaded risk analysis\n\nAcquisition and\ncontracts\n\nProcurement considerations, best practices, and constraints\n\nMonitoring,\nevaluation, and\ncontrol\n\nThe practice of observing project performance in terms of people\nand products, all with the intention of identifying issues as early as\npossible so we can retire them before they affect the project\nbaseline\n\nRisk management The process of identifying issues before they occur so we can\nmitigate the event or its impact\n\nSoftware\ndevelopment\n\nDealing with the unique challenges of developing and maintaining\nsource code in firmware, microprocessors, and systems\n\nHardware\ndevelopment\n\nDealing with the unique challenges of developing physical systems\nthat meet requirements for availability, reliability, and time to\nrepair\n\nEnable Focus on the project\u2019s human aspects Leadership and\nteamwork\n\nProject managers apply leadership: a skill that requires nurturing as\nmuch as any other\n\nStrategic\ncommunication\n\nBuilding advocacy for our projects is critical to survive periods of\nfiscal austerity or technical challenges\n\nCritical decision\nmaking\n\nEveryone on a project team makes decisions, but because the\nproject manager makes the most critical ones, this skill must be\ndeveloped\n\nCulture Leveraging the cultural norms every organization has is easy when\nthey help the project, but how do we deal with those norms when\nthey create hurdles?\n\n(continued)\n\n630 R. J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\n\n\nTo collaborate well, a technologist must understand the\nproject manager\u2019s perspective. In technology projects, he or\nshe often is the project leader and the one who had the idea\nin the first place. Depending on the situation, the technol-\nogist may have grown that project into laboratory status,\nwith multiple missions under the team\u2019s belt. Alternatively,\nthey may be just starting out, looking for the first great\nopportunity to apply the technology. In both cases the\ntechnologist is almost always smart, a gifted engineer or\nscientist, and a visionary. Often, he or she is an excellent\nmarketer interested in having the technology applied in as\nmany ways as possible.\n\nSpace flight project managers share many of these attri-\nbutes and we have found them to be equally smart, gifted\nengineers and visionaries. However, they are decidedly not\nmarketers. In fact, they listen to claims about the next \u2018big\nthing\u2019 with a lot of skepticism because they need to maintain\ntheir project on the lowest-risk path to its conclusion.\n\nTechnologists must recognize this mindset as a stable\ncharacteristic of project managers, knowing their skepticism\nwill rise whenever claims increase, the project gets closer to\nits delivery, or its budget becomes more constrained. This\nmeans technologists must understand that the space flight\nmission is not an opportunity for \u2018pure\u2019 research\u2014it is\n\u2018applied\u2019 research and development. Only in this way will\nthe two professionals collaborate harmoniously.\n\n22.3.1 Spanning the Project Life Cycle:\nDefining Common Threads\n\nProject management is iterative, so project managers and\ntechnologists spend their management time iterating\nthrough many activities that take place in parallel. This\nmethod is similar to a computer operating system\u2019s round-\nrobin approach to servicing the multiple processes running\non it. Some of these activities are specific to a life cycle\nphase and, once completed, are seldom revisited or are\nsimply updated. However, we do carry out many activities\nthroughout the project regardless of its life cycle phase.\nThey are the \u2018common threads\u2019 of project management.\n\nAs we turn our attention to collaborating on a project, we\nwill focus on these common threads between the technology\nand space flight mission projects while emphasizing the\ndifferent perspectives of technologists and space flight\nproject managers. Armed with this knowledge, technolo-\ngists are better positioned to tailor their messages and\nproducts so that the space flight project team can more\nreadily accept them. This in turn ensures the most favorable\nconsideration of the technology when the team develops a\nmission concept, integrates the technology during the\nimplementation and integration phases, and includes it in\nsuccessful mission operations.\n\n22.3.2 Recognizing Organizational\nKnowledge and Culture\n\nOrganizations want to reduce uncertainty about their pro-\ncesses in order to extend their own longevity. This means\nthey will repeat what has been successful. They capitalize\non their successes by using written and unwritten rules to\ninculcate their processes into the workforce\u2019s collective\nknowledge. These rules become the basis for their culture\nand are commonly referred to as \u2018cultural norms\u2019.\n\nCultural norms drive environmental factors that greatly\naffect space flight projects and, by extension, the relationship\nbetween project managers and technologists. Therefore,\ntechnologists and technology projects should take the time to\nunderstand a space flight project\u2019s organization and cultural\nnorms as much as possible. This understanding will be much\neasier if the technology project is part of the same organi-\nzation. However, a lack of understanding can harm rela-\ntionships across national borders, business sectors, such as\ngovernment and civilian space, and stand-alone elements in\na large organization, such as between NASA\u2019s field centers.\n\n22.3.2.1 Understand that Cultural Norms have\nImplications for Project Workforces\n\nCultural norms continually constrain project managers\nthroughout a project\u2019s life cycle, as long as the environment\ndoesn\u2019t change through reorganization, merger, or departure\n\nTable 22.4 (continued)\n\nFocus or goal Model aspects Brief explanation\n\nReassess Step back to periodically re-evaluate\nthe project\u2019s progress and overall\nefficiency\n\nProject\nmanagement\nmaturity\n\nBy evaluating our project against a predefined scale, we can\nidentify where the team is behind in the \u2018maturity\u2019 of its work and\napply more resources to address the deficit\n\nStrategic issues in\nproject\nmanagement\n\nContinuing education is a critical part of the project manager\u2019s\nwork portfolio. Sharing knowledge and lessons learned with other\npractitioners ensures we are not blind to the strengths and\nweaknesses of an individual or the team. It also ensures we apply\ncorrective measures\n\nA model describes aspects of a given discipline. The BEER model describes the practice of project management in terms that enable its\npractitioners to address this complex activity more completely\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 631\n\n\n\nof key employees. These constraints are extensive\u2014span-\nning workforce groupings, individual practitioner roles and\nresponsibilities, internal and external stakeholder expecta-\ntions, and required technical, schedule, and cost margins.\nThey may also define the accepted suite of applications and\ntools by which projects do their work, report, and publish\nproducts. One of the most significant implications is how\nmuch direct control the project manager will have over the\nspace flight project and the people assigned to the project\nteam. For example, suppose an organization groups its staff\nby product line, capability, or function. In this case, a\ndedicated manager will supervise people and the\n\ndevelopment effort, so the project manager may have little\ncontrol (other than persuasion) over team members. He or\nshe typically becomes a key data source by acting as a\nbridge between the end-user and the development group.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, some organizations\n\u2018project-ize\u2019 their workforce by grouping people into dis-\ncrete projects, with a project manager controlling the pro-\nject, team-member assignments, and their performance\nassessments. Although these organizations give project\nmanagers maximum control, they exhibit inherent weak-\nnesses, e.g. requiring time to hire new project members, the\nplanning required to develop employees, completing\n\nTable 22.5 Project roles and responsibilities\n\nProject position Responsibilities\n\nProject Manager \u2022 Leader of the project team\n\n\u2022 Ultimately responsible for project team\u2019s performance and of the mission\u2019s operational performance\n\n\u2022 Ultimate authority for budget and commitments\n\n\u2022 Is \u2018owner\u2019 of the project plan: the one person responsible for this document\u2019s content, as sanctioned by the\ngoverning authority\n\nDeputy Project Manager \u2022 Leads the project team when the Project Manager isn\u2019t available\n\n\u2022 May be the contracting officer\u2019s technical representative for U.S. government contracts, which results in\nsignificant responsibility.

J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\n\n\nperformance assessments, with corrective action in some\ncases, and placing personnel on new teams when the project\nis completed.\n\nTo be successful, project managers need skills in man-\naging human capital and in the disciplines that a project\nrequires.\n\nMost organizations have sought a hybrid solution that\nleverages the strengths of these two approaches while\nminimizing the inherent weaknesses: i.e. a \u2018matrix\u2019 orga-\nnization. Here, employees may be organized by end prod-\nuct, function, or capability but are assigned to the project\nmanager while on the project. Matrix organizations use this\nconcept to varying degrees and give the project manager\nvarying amounts of control.\n\nTechnologists must understand the project manager\u2019s\ncontrol level in order to adjust the marketing of their\ntechnology and integrate the two projects more smoothly\nonce they have decided to collaborate. Refer to the Project\nManagement Institute\u2019s Body of Knowledge [12] for details\non organizational structures and their implications for the\nproject managers.\n\n22.3.2.2 Follow Two Key Principles for Managing\nCultural Norms\n\nFirst, know the environment. As a technology manager, if\nyou\u2019re not in the same organization as the space flight pro-\nject, you must bridge its cultural norms. Even in the case\nwhere both projects are in your own organization, other\ndepartments may have different cultural norms. This is\nespecially true if the organization has acquired other com-\npanies and is merging different cultures. You must spend\ntime identifying and then evaluating the differences between\nyour own environment and the space flight project\u2019s culture\nthat will drive development. If you do not bridge cultural\nnorms, you may discover mismatched expectations, policies,\nand processes that turn what could have been excellent\ncollaboration into a stressful relationship.\n\nSecond, do not expect latitude where none exists. For\nexample, you may have spent time in the freedom of an\nacademic or loosely governed organization and now want to\nsee the cultural norms of your home organization applied to\nyour part of the space flight project. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if it\nworked this way? It doesn\u2019t. You have to anticipate how\nmuch flexibility the project manager\u2019s home organization\nwill allow you. This consideration is important because\nthese norms will affect your entire technology-project team,\ncontrol what work is needed, and determine how you will\nreport status. Therefore, you must anticipate how team\ndynamics may affect your people. In addition, if you are\nfollowing a legal contract that establishes your relationship\nwith the space flight project, you will need to be sure it\nreflects the potential inefficiencies of this new environment.\n\n22.3.2.3 Understanding Project Roles\nand Responsibilities\n\nMany people have studied teams, their characteristics, and\nthe tools needed to measure their effectiveness. Ideally,\nleaders want their teams to be interdependent and cohesive.\nInterdependence means the members\u2019 skills have minimum\noverlap, everyone can communicate openly and candidly\nwithout retribution, and each person can rely on the others\nto complete tasks in time for their own work to progress.\nCohesiveness measures the strength of ties that bind indi-\nviduals to the team, keep them motivated, and commit them\nfully to continue working towards the project\u2019s assigned\ngoal. As the technologist, you must apply your own mea-\nsures to ensure that your project reaches the highest level of\ninterdependence and cohesiveness. The project manager\nyou are collaborating with will do the same.\n\nUnless a contract determines the relationship between\nthe space flight project and the technology project, collab-\noration will depend on how effectively the two teams work\ntogether to achieve their fullest potential. For two groups to\ncollaborate effectively, though, each must understand the\nother\u2019s roles and responsibilities. Therefore, you must know\nthe roles and responsibilities of the core members of the\nspace flight project if the right discussions are going to take\nplace. Not recognizing constraints on a person\u2019s position\nfor making agreements or committing resources can set\nboth parties on the wrong path, which results in lost time,\nwasted resources, and lost trust. Figure 22.4 illustrates the\nstructure of a generic space flight project in terms of its\nsegments.\n\nAs Fig. 22.4 illustrates, the project\u2019s positions relate to\neach other hierarchically, so each position has a span of\ncontrol or authority\u2014normally referred to as roles and\nresponsibilities. Figure 22.5 defines the roles and responsi-\nbilities of a project\u2019s senior members on a typical space\nflight project.\n\n22.3.3 Managing Stakeholders and Their\nExpectations\n\nTo this point, we have discussed the environment created by\nthe organization that is hosting the space flight project and\nthen focused on the project\u2019s generic structure. Our third\ncommon thread continues the focus on people, but expands\nour perspective to the mission stakeholders.\n\nBy definition, stakeholders are individuals or organiza-\ntions that can directly or indirectly influence a project. They\ncan advocate or oppose it and be passive or active in their\ninvolvement. That means they can affect what a project\ndoes, how it does it, and what ultimately defines mission\nsuccess. On a space flight project stakeholders can approve\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 633\n\n\n\nwaivers to excuse process requirements in order to achieve\nsimpler execution, or they can extract every last ounce of\neffort from the team in terms of documentation, analysis,\nand requirements verification. Simply put, their require-\nments can influence a project\u2019s workload, budget, and\nschedule for good or bad.\n\nStakeholders often overlap for technology and space\nflight projects but not always completely. Therefore, a key\ncore competency for project managers and technologists is\n\nthe ability to identify stakeholders, categorize them by their\nability to affect the effort, engage them in a timely manner,\ncommunicate with them effectively through direct interac-\ntion or other methods, and ultimately manage their expec-\ntations while carrying out the mission.\n\nWhenever project managers and technologists work\neffectively together to construct a strategic communication\napproach for key stakeholders and use it regularly, fantastic\nresults can follow.\n\nProject Manager\nDeputy Project Manager\n\nDeputy Project Manager / Resources\n\nMission Systems \nEngineer\n\nQuality and Safety \nAssurance Manager\n\nResources \nManagement Group\n\nProject Support \nGroup\n\nObservatory Manager\nGround Systems \n\nManager\n\nDeputy Observatory \nManager\n\nGround Systems \nImplementation \n\nManager\n\nMission Operations \nManager\n\nGround Systems \nMission Readiness \n\nManager\n\nInstrument Systems \nManager\n\nInstrument Manager \n1\n\nInstrument Manager \n2\n\nInstrument Manager \n3\n\nInstrument Manager \n4\n\nFig. 22.4 Generic space flight\nproject.

Menrad and G. W.

The PMI PMBOK\n[13] is an excellent example of a project-management\nframework that includes this topic. However, one can easily\nbe consumed by the thesis-like discussions of \u2018layers\u2019 of\nstakeholders, the names of these layers, the nature of the\nstakeholder\u2019s influence on the project, and the process to\ninteract with them. For success in this area, we need to\nexamine the topic broadly enough to ensure that we have a\ncomplete list. At Goddard Space Flight Center, common\nstakeholders include the Center Director and senior staff,\nDirectorate heads, the Principal Investigator or Project\nScientist, and line managers with matrix personnel who join\nthe project as and when necessary. Notice that we have not\neven left the center yet! Add in managers at NASA Head-\nquarters, corporate managers of the project\u2019s partners, and\nso forth, and we see that the list grows very quickly.\n\nNo matter how much effort we put into identifying stake-\nholders, we are likely to miss some. Which ones? Probably\nthose with a more tangential relationship to the project, e.g.\npeople supporting the U.S. National Environmental Protec-\ntion Act (environmental impact), Department of Energy\n(nuclear power), Congressional staff (programmatic), other\ngovernments (international missions), environmental groups\n(from nuclear power systems to the shipping of hazardous\nwaste), and local community action groups.\n\nTo help resolve the risk of missing some stakeholders in\nthe original survey, project managers, technologists, and\ntheir respective teams regularly reassess their lists. As flight\nprojects change from their baseline, we are likely to remove\nsome stakeholders, add new ones, and occasionally change\nhow we engage those that continue.\n\n22.3.3.2 Manage Stakeholder Expectations\nWhether representing a technology project or a space flight\nproject, technologists and project managers talk to stake-\nholders from a position of integrity. This requires each\nproject team to deliver current, clear information on the\nproject\u2019s status and whether it will continue to progress and\nmeet commitments in the near-term. When a space flight\nproject adopts one or more technologies, the project man-\nager will include each technology\u2019s development status in\nreports to the stakeholders. Technologists must recognize\nthe importance of stakeholder management and fully\nengage in it.\n\n22.3.3.3 Avoid Stakeholder Conflicts\nIn dealing with some of their stakeholders, a pattern became\nobvious to senior managers at GSFC and the Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory, namely that mission success was not as easily\ndefined as they had assumed. Sometimes, stakeholders did\n\nnot agree with management concerning the observatory\u2019s\n\u2018successful\u2019 on-orbit performance or operational status of a\nground-data system element. Both centers sponsored a\nstudy in the early 1990s to understand how success can be\nconsidered failure and vice versa.\n\nThe detailed results of this study appear in Chap. 22.2 of\nApplied Project Management for Space Systems [14], so we\nwill not repeat them here. However, we do want to\nemphasize that we cannot evaluate all projects using the\nsame success criteria. Rather, the study reported a new\nconcept\u2014mission paradigm\u2014that applies to all projects.\nThis means projects may have science, technology-dem-\nonstration, or operational missions, and the stakeholders\u2019\nexpectations and criteria that define success will differ for\neach one. So technologists and space flight project man-\nagers cannot assume their definition of success\u2014build it no\nmatter how long it takes and have it work perfectly in\norbit\u2014is the same as the stakeholders\u2019 definition. There-\nfore, project managers must learn the stakeholders\u2019 expec-\ntations when the project begins in order to clearly define its\nmission paradigm. Only then will project managers and\nteams know how to accurately weight the engineering\noptions, assess risks, and meet expectations.\n\nTechnologists and the project managers must have an\nequally candid conversation when discussing whether to\nadopt a new technology, because the paradigm will also\nextend to the technologists\u2019 activities. For example, on\ntechnology demonstration missions, a technologist may be\nable to influence stakeholders into extending schedules or\nincurring more cost. However, on science missions which\nuse that technology to collect data, the same influence may\nnot exist. In fact, this example highlights one of the most\nimportant distinctions between the teams collaborating on a\nmission. While one team focuses on meeting schedule and\ncost, another may work to meet functionality. Clearly, this\ndisparity is not in the best interest of the mission or the\ntechnology, so teams must agree on a common focus before\nthe challenges begin. Otherwise, manageable problems may\nbecome unmanageable.\n\n22.3.3.4 Handling Standards and Guidelines\nExperienced stakeholders who have acquired a lot of his-\ntorical performance data and worked on many projects at the\nsame time commonly write down their expectations in\nadvance. Known as policy documents, standards, or guide-\nlines, these documents specify the expectations and con-\nstraints for the space flight project throughout its life cycle.\n\nThese expectations and constraints can be extensive, so\nthe documentation will span all aspects of the project.\nExamples are applying engineering practices, such as\ntracking technical performance factors, assuring quality,\nsuch as frequency of inspections and audits, keeping people\nsafe, protecting national assets, establishing budget\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 635\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_22\n\n\nreserves, documenting confidence levels for cost estimation,\nand handling mission risks.\n\nAt certain times, we may modify any of these documents\nin order to address a need, such as showing insights gained\nby the organization, changes to risk tolerances, or adjust-\nments to affect overall performance by projects at the\nportfolio level. Relief normally comes to the project only\nthrough an established waiver process\u2014with no guarantee\nthat a given criterion will be eligible for waiver.\n\nTechnologists must be prepared to work within these\nestablished norms, and most are ready to do so. In some\ncases, we must adjust the technologist\u2019s deliverable, which\nin turn requires retesting of the new configuration. Exam-\nples of such changes are choice of parts, such as de-rating\nfactors, workmanship levels, manufacturing processes, such\nas certain fluxes or potting recipes, and surveillance, such as\nwitness plates for cleanliness.\n\nThe implications may extend beyond engineering or\nmanufacturing. They may also include requirements on the\nspace flight project for applying oversight or insight mea-\nsures in the technology lab. In summary, the technology\nproject will be expected to comply with a host of potentially\nrestrictive requirements that may increase cost and reduce\nflexibility.\n\n22.3.3.5 Define \u2018Mission Success\u2019\nat the Beginning\n\nProject managers can easily believe they are the keepers of\nthe definition of mission success, but this simply is not true.\nSo they must ask for the stakeholders\u2019 definition of success\nand then universally apply it throughout the project\u2019s life\ncycle.\n\n22.3.3.6 Bridge the Needs of Stakeholders\nand Technologists\n\nTechnologists want to fly their technology, and stakeholders\nwant their data. That is why both are in the business. In\nmany cases, they will not even know each other unless a\nscientific measurement, engineering assessment, or other\nmandate has driven the technology\u2019s development. For\nthese situations, project managers are the bridge between\nboth parties and may need to take one side or the other in\norder to converge on the best overall position for the mis-\nsion. When this happens, technologists may feel that the\nproject manager is not acting as their advocate. In an\nimportant way, that is true! Project managers should\nadvocate for the space flight project, not for a technology.\nRemembering this, especially during difficult times, will\nmake it easier to frame conversations in the most con-\nstructive terms.\n\n22.3.4 Shaping the Integrated Mission\nSchedule\n\nA common thread through all of a project\u2019s life cycle phases\nis the schedule. It is the flight plan for any project but\nespecially for space flight missions, in which many parallel\nactivities take place. Because schedule is so critical, project\nmanagers and many stakeholders pay a lot of attention to it.\n\nVery few projects are built from the top down, because\nthis approach is fraught with risk. Rather, scheduling almost\nalways takes a bottom-up approach: project elements\ndevelop their own schedules, often getting coordination or\nsupport from a dedicated scheduler on the space flight\nproject. At specific intervals, each element submits its latest\ndraft version of the schedule. All schedules then consolidate\ninto a single, main integrated mission schedule (IMS).\n\nAs space mission developers, we should not underesti-\nmate the time and effort needed to create an element-level\nschedule or the number of iterations we may need to\nincorporate required adjustments. These adjustments might\nbe necessary to more efficiently order the activities, syn-\nchronize predecessor and successor tasks, best use the\nworkforce, or create a baseline IMS. All of this effort occurs\nbefore the work has started, while the project is tracking\nschedule performance through milestone completion, the\nearned value schedule-performance-index (SPI), or similar\ntools for managing schedules.\n\n22.3.4.1 Tailor the Schedule\nCreating a schedule for a reasonably complex project\nactivity is specialized, so it often devolves to professional\nschedulers, but project managers and technologists still\nneed to understand basic scheduling principles. Among\nconcepts and calculations that should be familiar to any\nproject manager are critical path, margin, reserve, forward\nand backward calculations of slack, and dependencies. We\nwill not repeat here what you can find on scheduling in\nother project-management textbooks. However, we can add\nto the conversation by talking about how project managers\nmight tailor an IMS and why that is important.\n\nIn the life cycle model used by NASA, DoD, and many\nprivate companies in the United States, project managers\nand teams do not decide on the transition from one phase to\nanother. Depending on its criticality, the hosting organiza-\ntion or even first-tier stakeholders also may not make this\ndecision. Instead, this action goes to a decision authority: a\nsenior-level person who is advised by a board or council on\nthe project\u2019s maturity. The decision will depend on the\nresults of auditing necessary work products and similar\nfactors. Only this authority\u2019s express authorization can\n\n636 R. J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\n\n\ntransition the space flight project into the next phase. These\npoints in the project are called key decision points and they\ndrive all aspects of the space flight project\u2019s (and the\ntechnologist\u2019s) activities because they represent the end of\nwork that all project participants must complete at a certain\npoint in the schedule.\n\nKey decision points (KDP), i.e. milestones, are points of\nzero duration intended to mark the moment when work\nstarts, finishes, or requires a key decision. For a space fight\nproject at NASA the most important of these are the key\ndecision points. Besides KDP milestones, an organization is\nlikely to require the project manager to insert internal\nmilestones into the schedule for such activities as budget\nreviews, workforce actions, pre-briefings for upcoming\nmeetings, and reporting requirements. As described earlier,\nstakeholders set the policies, standards, and guidelines that\nconstrain the project. They also must become milestones in\nthe IMS, where they will fold into the technology project\u2019s\nactivities. Examples include peer reviews, formal indepen-\ndent reviews, and meetings with external groups.\n\nProject managers will insert more schedule milestones at\ntheir discretion to benefit the project. These milestones may\nbe project-wide or specific to a group. They may involve an\nactivity, or simply be intended to synchronize activities\nacross the project. For example, the manager may convene\nan all-hands meeting to review the lessons learned after\ncompleting a key activity.\n\nWhen necessary, project managers will define\nmore milestones for an activity that is running into difficulty.\nThese may be as simple as timed meetings to review status,\nprogress assessments, or\u2014in unfortunate circumstances\u2014\n\ndifficult decision points, such as substituting a new technical\napproach when the baseline approach isn\u2019t working.\n\n22.3.4.2 Manage Schedule Performance\nMost space flight projects have a huge number of schedule\nitems in the database: 2,500\u20133,500 is not unreasonable.\nHowever, trying to display all these entries would be\nunreasonable. As a result, a project rolls up its IMS into a\ntop-level schedule that is easier to read. It presents large\nrelationships, including the project\u2019s critical path\u2014the\nsequence of activities that has zero or the lowest slack. A\ntop-level schedule that GSFC would use is illustrated in\nFig. 22.5.\n\nThe top-level schedule is an excellent way to summarize\nthe IMS and inform project members, stakeholders, and the\norganization, but it is not the best format for managing\nschedule performance. That requires a critical milestone\nschedule (see Fig. 22.6), in which specific activities are\ndrawn out of the IMS database and displayed in a rolling\ntime-window format.\n\nProject managers and teams can use a critical milestone\nschedule to cut through myriad data and see what really\naffects the project\u2019s performance. By reviewing these\nfocused formats monthly as part of project meetings or\nregular business processes, they can draw attention to\nimportant activities that are late, coming soon, or represent\nworkload over a given period.\n\nWhen it comes to managing projects, schedule data\noffers project managers and technologists a lot of flexibility.\nAs an example, despite the best efforts to plan work accu-\nrately, one or more parts of a project will always take longer\n\nFig. 22.6 Critical milestone\nschedule. These schedules are an\nexcellent format for focusing on\nmajor activities that can strongly\naffect project performance. By\nreviewing critical milestones the\nproject managers can efficiently\nalign the project\u2019s focus\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 637\n\n\n\nthan planned. Also, certain tasks will have many delivera-\nbles, such as engineering drawings, that need to be done by\na certain time in order to meet a schedule milestone. Lastly,\nit is also probable that one or more activities within the\nproject were incorrectly planned as a result of missing\ninformation, unanticipated risks, or human error, and\ntherefore requires replanning. In these instances, putting\nschedule data in a special format allows focused tracking of\nthe effort. An example of this format is cumulative mile-\nstone tracking. Its power lies in its flexibility. We can use it\nto track project activities within specified periods, for\nspecified schedule items, or any combination of the two.\nFigure 22.7 illustrates how this format helps us define the\nplan for completing work and then tracking progress against\nthat plan.\n\nWith focus on the IMS and insights from the schedule\ndatabase, we may discover that a technology development\nwill take more time to complete than even the most pessi-\nmistic scheduler assumed. This problem arises most often\nwhen a flight mission adopts an immature technology, but\neven with technologies developed in advance to meet mission\nrequirements, we may still reach a point where no revision is\npossible within the program\u2019s constraints. The IMS will be an\nexcellent early indicator of this problem, as long as a team\ndoes not ignore or discount it because they believe their\noriginal decision was the right one. The key symptom for this\nproblem is a continual need for more time, which at some\npoint the space flight project will not be able to grant.\n\nOne way to mitigate this risk lies in improving detail\nduring the interaction that takes place between the space\nflight and technology projects early in the life cycle phases.\nNormally, this interaction occurs before anyone commits to\nincorporating the technology into the mission baseline.\nSchedule considerations may therefore be but one way to\n\ndetermine whether the technology will work for this\napplication. If the technologist can provide schedules for the\ntechnology-development activities, the project can make\nfewer assumptions and plan better. The goal here is to\nreduce the amount of time a technologist needs to plan new\nactivities. If schedule inputs aren\u2019t available, the technolo-\ngist must plan sufficient time to enable both sides to pull this\ninformation together, define special schedule formats early,\nand then convene regular meetings to assess performance\nagainst the defined plan.\n\n22.3.4.3 Handle Tough Scheduling Decisions\nUltimately, a technologist will know whether a project is\nmeeting its initial commitments. After missing significant\nmilestones, the technologist and project manager will have\nrecognized the problem and discussed the negative perfor-\nmance trend. Unless things change, the project manager\nfaces a tough decision. Nobody enters into an agreement\nintending to fail and, understandably, nobody wants to have\nhis or her technology removed from a space flight project.\nBut it does happen when the project can\u2019t tolerate schedule\ndelays any longer if it is to support the mission paradigm.\nPlanetary missions are an excellent example: launch win-\ndows are limited, so delays are costly.\n\nHow do we determine when this action of last resort is\nnecessary? Although many approaches are possible, one of\nthe fairest is for the technologist and project manager to\ndefine the key milestones at which, if the trend has not\nchanged, the technology must go. By negotiating, both sides\ncan work together to provide a technology team the maxi-\nmum time while still protecting the space flight project.\n\nThis is exactly what happened to an instrument on a\nheliophysics mission at GSFC. The instrument\u2019s original\ndesign took advantage of a new detector that was unproven\n\nFig. 22.7 Cumulative milestone\ntracking schedule. Project\nmanagers can use schedule data\nin special formats to focus on\ncritical work and its completion\nrate\n\n638 R. J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\n\n\nin space but showed great promise in the laboratory. The\nspace flight project incorporated this instrument into its\npayload with the new detectors, and the integrated team\nbegan building the instrument. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t\nmature the detectors in time, and the instrument\u2019s devel-\nopment fell significantly behind schedule. Working toge-\nther, the project manager and technologist developed a\nrecovery plan\u2014defining clear milestones and what was\nneeded at each one. They also teamed to brief the stake-\nholders. The recovery plan allowed the technology project\nseveral months to recover, but they were unsuccessful. The\nproject replaced the instrument\u2019s unproven detectors with\nmore mature ones, and the mission eventually flew into\nspace and is still operating as of 2013. This was a perfect\nexample of a strong collaboration between the technologist\nand project manager giving the new technology every\nchance to fly but, once it clearly could not overcome the\nobstacles, agreeing that the space flight project should\ncontinue its march toward launching on its own.\n\n22.3.5 Defining, Phasing, and Managing\nthe Budget\n\nAccurately defining a project\u2019s budget requirements for the\nentire life cycle is the key to any successful project. This\ntask becomes more complicated as the project schedule\ngrows longer, perhaps spanning several fiscal years, or\nbecomes more complex. Even in projects with a well-\ndefined budget, failure to manage expenditures sufficiently\nclosely and identify trends early on is a recipe for failure.\n\nRegardless of the cause, a poorly defined or managed\nbudget will at best prematurely drain project reserves: the\nrelatively small amount of extra money available to the\nproject manager. In extreme cases, not budgeting realisti-\ncally may mean a project fails to satisfy stakeholder com-\nmitments, thus delaying its transition into subsequent life\ncycle phases or even being canceled. Space flight projects\nrecognize the importance of continually managing their\nbudgets.\n\nThe mission paradigm for a space flight project will\nlargely dictate the tone set by the project manager and\nbusiness team. This means technologists must anticipate\ndifferent priorities from mission to mission and engage the\nproject manager early in the relationship in order to confirm\nthem. Is this a technology-demonstration mission in which\nmeeting functional requirements is paramount? Or, is this\nan operational mission for which we must deliver at least a\nminimum level of performance in order to satisfy the\nschedule? Once all project participants discuss and under-\nstand the mission paradigm, they can begin to define the\nbudget.\n\n22.3.5.1 Estimate Project Costs\nThe goal of cost estimation is defining accurately the\nresources required to complete a task, but that can be\nextremely complicated and challenging. For space flight\nprojects, it is downright hard and\u2014more often than not\u2014\nthe resulting estimate under-predicts what the project will\nrequire in order to be successful. So planners pay a lot of\nattention to cost estimating and often continue it throughout\nthe project\u2019s life cycle.\n\nThe space flight project\u2019s business team will take the\nresults of the engineering process to define the mission and\ndevelop a basis of estimate (BOE) for the team. The high-\nest-ranking resources manager on the project normally\nhandles the BOE process. This manager\u2019s team typically\ncreates the BOE materials, outlines the schedule, and\nestablishes ground rules. The BOE materials usually include\ntwo important pieces of information: budgeting guidelines\nand the budget-definition template.\n\nBudgeting guidelines offer specifics on the process the\nteam will follow and may include such topics as milestones\nfor the process within the project, reconciliation periods,\ndirection for funded and unfunded contingencies, workforce\nskill categories, their associated rates, and escalation fac-\ntors, and direction for handling indirect costs such as fees,\nadministrative expenses, and travel.\n\nThe cost account manager (CAM) normally completes\nthe BOE templates\u2014in the best case, with input from the\ntechnical team working with the CAM. The CAM provides\nthe requested information and is encouraged to identify any\nassumptions outside those that the project captures, as well\nas any risks that may cause the plan to change.\n\nWith project-wide guidance in place, the technology\nproject may begin to develop their cost estimate. How they\ndo this will depend on the maturity of the technology being\napplied, the amount and complexity of changes required for\nthe space flight project\u2019s application, and the team\u2019s expe-\nrience under similar conditions.\n\nMany schedule and cost-estimation tools are available to\nsupport budget creation. No single tool has been able to\ngenerate an accurate budget in all situations, so technologists\nand their teams\u2014consulting with the space flight project\u2019s\nfinancial and business community\u2014must determine the\ntools that will drive production of the BOE. Table 22.6\nsummarizes many common approaches and their best use.\n\n22.3.5.2 Estimate Workforce Costs\nThe project team will have a staffing profile to cover the time\nwhen work is scheduled for completion. The major variables\nin defining costs are the skill levels of the people who work\non the project, how long they will be charged to the project\u2019s\nbudget and the total number of workers for each monthly\nbudgeted period. The project manager will negotiate with\nthe technologist concerning the duration and staffing needed\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 639\n\n\n\nto tailor the technology in the lab and to integrate parts of\nthat team with the project team. How they interact will\ndepend on the work inherent to a particular life cycle phase.\nTypically, the first iteration of workforce planning produces\nabnormal peaks and valleys in the profile. Because people\nare involved, these peaks and valleys are not acceptable or\nefficient. So the project team will undergo \u2018resource level-\ning\u2019 to reorder the work and smooth out the profile, even if it\nslightly lengthens the overall schedule.\n\nTechnologists must not assume the project will \u2018carry\u2019\ntheir lab or many of their people. Project managers nego-\ntiate the right level of support, at the right time in the life\ncycle, and for the right duration. Technologists must rec-\nognize the importance of negotiating a valid plan and then\narrange the lab\u2019s affairs so that it can happen.\n\n22.3.5.3 Estimate Task Contingencies\nand Project Reserve\n\nNo one can accurately define the future, but project man-\nagers are highly skilled in setting aside funds to address\nuncertainties. Technologists also are empowered to identify\nwhere uncertainty exists and where they cannot adequately\ncontrol external influences. Classic examples are delivery of\nlong-lead parts or availability of integration and test facil-\nities. In these instances, a technologist and the project team\nwill add contingency and then track it very closely because\nall players in the project see the consumption of contin-\ngency as a measure of potential problems.\n\nSpace flight projects won\u2019t recognize all uncertainties in\nthe budget estimate. Even when we believe our plans are\naccurate and complete, actual performance may differ,\n\nTable 22.6 Cost estimation tools\n\nApproximate accuracy Tool title Remarks\n\nCoarse estimate (lowest\naccuracy)\n\nWAG, also known\nas V-ROM\n\nLeast accurate of all the techniques: tantamount to a \u2018guess\u2019 Fastest, cheapest\nestimate\n\nRough order\nestimate (ROM)\n\nTypically defined by a stakeholder or the project manager\n\nMarginally better than a WAG (V-ROM\u2014sponsors can expect accuracy no better\nthan \u00b150 %\n\nCoarse estimate (lower\naccuracy)\n\nDelphi Best used on one-of-a-kind build where we have little or no experience or data\n\nUses experience of one or more subject matter experts to hone in on an estimate\n\nMay use global knowledge of the subject matter experts or be anonymous\n\nTop-down A team-based technique for which management predefines allocations across the\nparticipants\n\nMay use under competition with capped life cycle cost\n\nA tempting way to define costs but flawed because it separates the estimate\u2019s creator\nfrom the actual producer of the work\n\nCoarse estimate (low\naccuracy)\n\nStandards Organization-based and typically used for parts of the project\u2014for example,\nmanagement equals 10 % of technical hours\n\nAnalytical estimate\n(intermediate accuracy)\n\nExtrapolation Uses historical data to estimate price when present activity is out-of-family (desired\ndata point is outside the range)\n\nMay use with the Delphi method to bound uncertainty\n\nAnalogy May use when present build is in-family with past activities (desired point is inside\nthe range)\n\nParametric cost Algebraically represents cost using variables common to all builds, resulting in cost\nestimation functions\n\nUses past performance to fine-tune coefficients and address historical risks\n\nSpecialist estimate (higher\naccuracy)\n\nPricing team Employs specialists in CE to help the project develop an estimate\n\nTypically, holders of the most accurate database of historic performance\n\nMost proficient at using CE tools and customizing the combination of tools for a\nspecific instance\n\nTeam-based estimate (highest\naccuracy)\n\nBottom-up Most accurate CE approach but also most time-consuming and expensive\n\nPlaces estimation responsibility with the producer, who must commit to delivering\n\nAll parties in the space flight mission must estimate the costs for their tasks. Although no one tool accurately does this, they can use many\navailable tools\n\n640 R. J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\n\n\nresulting in the need for more funding. Project management\nwill respond by directing the resources community to hold\npart of the money in reserve and then release it to make the\nnecessary adjustments.\n\nTechnology and space flight projects are inherently dif-\nficult, so no project\u2019s performance is perfect and nor are all\nplans right. Therefore, technologists and project managers\nmust carefully monitor a technology project\u2019s performance,\njust as they would for all parts of the space flight project.\nThe key is to ensure they use reserve money for transient\nconditions and not for systemic flaws. They cannot allow\nsuch flaws to continue in any part of the project.\n\nProject managers and technologists should define how\nthey can lessen a project\u2019s scope\u2014called descoping\u2014while\nemotions are in check. The best time is early in the life\ncycle, with requirements defined (though minor work may\ncontinue), the technology development plan in place, and\nthe schedule and budget taking shape. By definition, de-\nscoping options are clearly defined, managed reductions of\ncapabilities that reduce the work needed while still ensuring\nthe mission will meet performance requirements. They are\nan important arrow in the project manager\u2019s quiver because\ntaking descopes can be a last resort to keep project cost\nwithin stakeholder constraints, reduce drains on project\nreserve, and protect against more schedule erosion. The\nchallenge is that people never want to produce something\nless than what they envision, so descoping discussions can\nbecome heated. Hence, managers should make descopes\npart of planning, control their configuration, and apply them\nonly when necessary.\n\n22.3.5.4 Repeat the Budget Process\nBecause funding is the life\u2019s blood for a project, and\nsponsors often have several projects running simultaneously\nat different phases of the life cycle, technologists can expect\na detailed annual review of the budget. Typically in the\nmiddle of the fiscal year, each space flight project, \u2018marks\u2019\nthe budget by using actual costs for all prior years and the\nfirst 6 months of the current fiscal year, and requires an\nupdated basis for estimating the remaining 6 months of that\nfiscal year and all future years left in the life cycle.\n\nThis information feeds into an updated project budget,\nwhich may be very different because of internal adjustments\nneeded to cover poor performance, increased costs, or\nchange requirements. Also possible are external adjust-\nments, such as sponsor-specified budget reductions, lack of\na launch vehicle, or loss of expected institutional funds.\nManagers must reconcile the budget to ensure life cycle cost\ncommitments are intact, the revised budget is fully defen-\nsible, and the reserve levels cover the mission\u2019s remaining\nlife cycle phases. For obvious reasons, technologists are\ninvolved directly in this annual budget process.\n\nA lot of information comes out of the budget process\nbeyond knowing how much time and resources a task is\nplanning to use. The estimate at completion (EAC) is one of\nthe most important. This number projects what the final cost\nwill be for any task, series of tasks, or the entire project. We\ncan calculate the EAC in several ways, and not all algo-\nrithms are meant for all situations. Are unique past chal-\nlenges finished? Is the difficult work about to begin? Are\nprocess changes available to increase schedule efficiency?\nThese represent some of the questions we need to answer in\norder to project an accurate EAC. The technologist and his\nor her business team must provide as much information as\npossible to the space flight project\u2019s business team to enable\nthe latter to calculate an accurate EAC. This value will be a\nmajor driver of how the project manager handles this aspect\nof the project during the next budgeted period.\n\nMoney constraints are a fact of life for most organiza-\ntions. Although they will continue to have a portfolio of\nmissions spanning all types, these constraints are likely to\nbe strong enough to lower their tolerance of schedule delays\nand cost overruns. Therefore, the stakeholder\u2019s actual tol-\nerance of risk determines the accuracy of estimates and\ncandor in reporting.\n\n22.3.6 Managing Risk Continuously\n\nAll common threads are essential to a properly working\nproject, but only a select few are both highly visible and\nhard to apply correctly. Continuous risk management\n(CRM) is one of these \u2018special\u2019 common threads. Therefore,\ntechnologists and everyone working on the technology\nproject must fully understand the risk process, become\nskilled at applying it, and calibrate it accurately to the space\nflight project\u2019s cultural norms during all project phases.\n\n22.3.6.1 What is CRM?\nCRM is the process of looking across all aspects of a project\nto identify early on those issues that may go wrong. Because\nsuccessful CRM identifies the problem before it causes\nharm, stakeholders and organizations have embraced it fully\nin an attempt to save budget, save schedule, and increase the\noverall likelihood of mission success. In fact, many orga-\nnizations mandate its use. Figure 22.8 shows the iterative\nprocess GSFC uses in response to NASA Headquarters\npolicy [15]. Although CRM may be documented at the top\nlevel, the space flight project will know its internal process,\nthe format for reporting results, and how to use identified\nrisks for the budget process.\n\nProject managers can lead CRM for small projects, but\nlarger, more complex projects usually hire a risk manager. In\nany case, project managers must be fully involved in the\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 641\n\n\n\nprocess. If it is unclear whether hiring a dedicated risk\nmanager is necessary, we recommend hiring one because of\nhigh demands on the project manager\u2019s time and the ten-\ndency to underestimate risk. If budget is an issue but hiring a\nrisk manager makes sense, the project manager should define\na staffing profile with more effort at the start and then enter\nan internal-project CRM milestone in the integrated mission\nschedule. At this milestone the risk manager and project\nmanager review the CRM activity to date and, with a much\nbetter understanding of the project environment, determine\nhow best to proceed with the support of a dedicated risk\nmanager. This conversation often is easier than expected\nbecause proficient risk managers are not interested in\nworking on a project with too little workload to keep them\nfully engaged. When selecting a CRM practitioner, keep in\nmind that certification programs are now available; the U.S.\nProject Management Institute (PMI) is one example.\n\n22.3.6.2 Why is CRM so Important?\nWith all the literature available on CRM and the number of\norganizations that use it, we will assume everyone on a\ntechnology or space flight project has been exposed to it.\nHere, we are concerned less about how to use CRM than\nwhy it is so important.\n\nRisk management is more than a tool, it\u2019s a mindset.\nOnce we become skilled at thinking in risk terms, we tend\nto do it all the time and it becomes second nature and\npervades our work. Whether it is an engineering, budget, or\nschedule challenge, we include risk in the analysis and try\nto make the plan more robust. As a result, CRM specialists\ntend to generate products of higher quality, at or below the\nnegotiated cost and within deadlines. However, project\nmanagers and technologists cannot assume that all members\nof their teams have this mindset, so they need to ensure that\neveryone is thinking about CRM. They can best do so by\ndemonstrating the process publicly, underscoring its\nimportance at general meetings, and calling attention to\nactions that reduce the project\u2019s overall risk exposure.\n\nNo matter how much effort we expend, no plan is per-\nfect. Despite the project team\u2019s best efforts, every plan will\nencounter unidentified risks. Therefore, nobody should\nassume that CRM will enable their project to escape them.\nWe want to use CRM in order to reduce risk sources to two\ncategories, so that we can better manage net inherent risk.\n\u2022 Known unknowns\u2014a source of risk because we lack\n\nknowledge in an area where we know the information\nexists. The project will uncover this information with\nmore effort or time, and CRM will then continue as\nnormal.\n\n\u2022 Unknown unknowns\u2014a source of risk because we lack\nknowledge in an area where the information will not\nbecome available. We commonly refer to these issues as\n\npart of \u2018Murphy\u2019s Law\u2019 and have to deal with them as\nthey arise.\n\n22.3.6.3 How Should Projects Manage Risk?\nMost importantly, the project alone cannot or should not\nanswer these questions; managers must discuss risk with the\nstakeholders and organization. The project manager will\nthen calibrate the project to this level of risk tolerance. At\nNASA, risk tolerance for space flight missions is an\nimportant conversation\u2014so important that official policy\nand procedures have codified it [16]. How a space flight\nmission deals with risk depends on the mission paradigm,\nthe stakeholders\u2019 tolerance, the life cycle phase, and how a\nproject assesses the consequences if the risked event occurs.\n\nImplications from the mission paradigm and stakehold-\ners\u2019 tolerances are self-explanatory, but those from the life\ncycle phase may be less obvious.\n\nOften, managers think of CRM in terms of risks uncov-\nered during implementation, but this orientation limits the\ntool\u2019s power. If risk management is ingrained in a project, it\nwill identify and factor risk into the earliest mission defini-\ntion. The cumulative effect of all accepted risks is the \u2018risk\nposture\u2019 at the start of the project. Stakeholders review this\nrisk posture as much as the mission itself when someone is\ntrying to sell the mission to them, especially for a compet-\nitive environment in which mission cost typically is capped.\nThis early stage in assessing and accepting risk is a critical\ntime for the project and the technology team.\n\nAt the start of the life cycle, the project team is syn-\nthesizing the baseline plan of what to build and how to build\nit. The space flight project is asking itself whether the\ninherent risks of a new technology are appropriate. Tech-\nnologists who can explain the benefits of their technology in\nengineering and risk terms can best convince the project to\napply it.\n\nEven when technologists and project managers fully\ndiscuss why to use a new technology, sometimes it is\nappropriate for the latter to decline. This decision should\nresult primarily from analyzing the technology\u2019s ability to\nsatisfy the project\u2019s requirements. In other words, the\ntechnology may be fine in and of itself, but another solution\nmay represent a lower cumulative risk.\n\nOnce the project establishes a mission baseline including\nthe new technology, it has an initial risk posture. From this\npoint forward, the technology and space flight projects\ntransition into the traditional mode of identifying, classi-\nfying, and mitigating risk. They will use a documented\nprocess that fully incorporates the technologist and tech-\nnology project. As the project manager identifies a risk, he\nor she may require the technology project to analyze it,\ndetermine its trigger, establish its consequences, and pro-\npose a possible way to mitigate it. These studies may not be\n\n642 R. J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\n\n\nfunded, so technologists must recognize their implications\nfor the overall schedule\u2014especially their cumulative effect.\n\nNot to fly is better than to suffer a bad flight. We have no\ncost-effective remedy for matching a good technology with\na bad application. Large or small risk entries in the database\nwill not make the wrong application of any technology\nright. Because everyone\u2019s reputation is always at stake, we\nneed to use higher-order thinking and admit facts when the\nmatch is not right. If the mission\u2019s purpose is to fly the\ntechnology, then the technologist and project manager must\nwork together carefully to produce an accurate, risk-based\ndecision for proceeding.\n\nOpportunity management demands attention too. CRM\nfocuses on the negative, but what about good changes to the\nproject\u2019s plans? Called \u2018opportunity management\u2019, this\npossibility gets discussed in the academic or standards\ncommunities, but it doesn\u2019t get the same level of attention\nfrom projects or their stakeholders. The reasons why are\nnumerous and varied. In our experience, the main reason is\nthe naturally occurring bias that exists in almost all projects\nwhen planned. Meaningful positive events are less probable\nthan the risks we have all come to anticipate. In other\nwords, when talking about Murphy\u2019s Law nobody ever says\nMurphy may have a sibling! Regardless of the reason,\ntechnologists and project managers must discuss at risk\nmeetings those future events that could end sooner, cost less\nto complete, or reduce requirements\u2014thereby lowering\nproject costs or the overall residual risk.\n\n22.3.6.4 How Do We Report Project Risks\nEffectively?\n\nWith CRM being a critical activity within the project, it is\nnot surprising that reporting risk is an equally important\nactivity.\n\nThe goal of CRM is to identify risks and then evaluate\neach one in terms of the likelihood and potential conse-\nquences of its occurrence. The process is not supposed to be\nlimited to any one aspect of the project; it is a compre-\nhensive tool for a repeatable process that looks at technical,\nprogram, and other key aspects of the project\u2019s execution.\nTo categorize each risk, the project uses a \u2018key\u2019. This helps\nto keep an individual project\u2019s evaluation consistent and\ngives the organization a unique perspective on risks com-\nmon to multiple projects when applying the same key to all.\nFigure 22.9 shows an example of the risk-evaluation key\nthat GSFC uses across our project portfolio.\n\nAs risk is so important, a large number of stakeholders\nwant to know the status of a project\u2019s CRM, so we normally\nsummarize risk information in standard reports.\nFigure 22.10 shows an example of a project\u2019s summary risk\nchart. Most projects have many risks, so reports typically\nfocus the audience\u2019s attention on the top ten.\n\nAlthough it is important to understand a project\u2019s overall\nrisk posture at all times, summary data seldom meets a\nstakeholders\u2019 need for understanding a specific risk. So the\nrisk section of a project report usually pairs the summary\nchart with a risk focus chart that offers more insight into the\ntop ten risks. The normal practice at GSFC is to provide this\nadditional focus only on \u2018red\u2019 and \u2018yellow\u2019 risks. Table 22.7\nshows what additional information is provided for each of\nthe risks we\u2019re focusing on.\n\n22.3.7 Managing Team Activities\n\nProject managers get work done through people, so they\nfocus most of their time on the people critical to a project\u2019s\nsuccess. Our experience from many projects has identified\nsome best practices for project managers of a space flight\nproject working with a technology project: project meet-\nings, configuration change control, and management infor-\nmation systems.\n\n22.3.7.1 Manage Project Meetings\nCommunication is a key to mission success: with stake-\nholders, within the organization, and especially among\nproject team members. Regular meetings for the entire\nproject team\u2014space flight project and selected technology\nproject people\u2014are a key way to ensure everyone under-\nstands the project\u2019s current status, knows the detailed plans\nfor upcoming near-term tasks, and has a clear vision for the\nchallenges that lie ahead.\n\nIf geographical separation, language barriers, or other\ncomplicating factors are at play, project managers need to\ncommunicate consistently with the project team.\n\nTechnologists and space flight project managers must\nensure their respective teams communicate well among\n\nIdentify\n\nAnalyze\n\nPlanTrack\n\nControl\n\nFig. 22.8 Process for continuous risk management. The key to risk\nmanagement is finding problems before they occur. It repeats\nthroughout the project\u2019s life cycle\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 643\n\n\n\nthemselves. However, whenever the technology is being\nintegrated into the space flight mission, both managers must\nmeet the extra challenge of linking their approaches\neffectively.\n\nSenior staff meetings. Accomplished project managers\nknow they cannot do everything on their own. That is why\nprojects have deputies, group leads, and other senior-level\npositions. The more closely this small team aligns with the\nproject manager\u2019s priorities, the more integrated the entire\nproject will be. Thus, experienced project managers add a\nsmall, dedicated meeting to their weekly schedule that\nbrings together the senior staff: typically, the deputy project\nmanager, deputy project manager/resources, mission sys-\ntems engineer, instrument systems manager, observatory\nmanager, and ground segment manager. The purpose of this\nmeeting is to address sensitive matters that would be\ninappropriate for a project-wide discussion.\n\nThe senior staff work best in a short meeting, so each\nparticipant gets a limited chance to talk. For efficiency,\nparticipants should come to the meeting with their topics\nalready identified. Although sharing status is always\nimportant, the main purpose of this meeting is to focus on\nkey challenges facing the project. To establish the meeting\nas a cultural norm, project managers should put it on the\ncalendar for every week of the year, canceling only when\nnecessary.\n\nTechnologists also should have their own senior staff\nmeeting scheduled in parallel, so that they stay current on\nissues that affect the technology project and are likely to\nbecome part of a conversation with the project manager. If a\nchallenge needs a consolidated team\u2019s attention, either\nmanager should feel empowered to request a joint meeting.\n\nThat would give key decision makers the chance to discuss\nissues candidly and define appropriate action plans.\n\nWeekly meetings for project staff. Regular meetings are\nimportant to convey project information to the entire project\nteam: space flight and selected technology project people.\nThey ensure that everyone understands team status and\nplans for near-term tasks, and project priorities. Project\npeople are aware of the environment in which the project is\ndeveloping, but they do not have the project manager\u2019s\ninsights on current issues. The weekly project staff meeting\nis an excellent way to convey how issues affect the project\nand the team\u2019s response.\n\nAll-hands meetings. When a project involves many\npeople, or parts of the project are separated because of\ngeography or other factors, weekly project staff meetings\nwith all members of the team may become impractical.\nHowever, project members who do not participate in a\nweekly meeting still want to hear from the project manager.\nAll-hands meetings scheduled periodically throughout the\nyear can satisfy this need. Whenever possible, project\nmanagers should visit the team and lead the all-hands\nmeeting in person. However, remote technology can sub-\nstitute for personal contact during times of fast change or\nproject execution.\n\n22.3.7.2 Manage Change\nEarly in the project life cycle the team baselines final deci-\nsions for carrying out the mission in its project plans,\nspecifications, interface-control documents, integration and\ntest plans, operational procedures, integrated mission sche-\ndule, budget, and risk plan. All of these documents are\nsubject to configuration control. Without universally applied\n\nFig. 22.9 Risk item evaluation\nkey. For large projects, many\ndifferent people evaluate risks.\nTo ensure consistency in risk\ncategories, project members\ncommonly use a \u2018key\u2019\n\n644 R. J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\n\n\nchange-control procedures, the project will be at very high\nrisk of an error or even failure. This concept of change\ncontrol is so important that the organization usually defines\nthe policies\u2014and sometimes the specific work instruc-\ntions\u2014that all projects must follow. In some cases, organi-\nzations adopt standards documented by external groups,\nsuch as the International Organization for Standardization.\n\nSome change is inevitable, but not all change is neces-\nsary. To decide which changes to make, the space flight\nproject manager convenes a change control board (CCB).\n\nLarge, complex projects may use a hierarchy of boards.\nThey may assign lower boards responsibility for controlling\nthe changes that affect only their project segment or that\ncost less than a preset amount of budget. An example would\nbe the GSFC\u2019s Earth Observing System Data Information\nSystem (ESDIS). This project has three CCBs: overall\nproject, flight segment, and science segment. However,\nboard members need discipline because changes that exceed\na lower board\u2019s authority must go to the project-level CCB\nfor disposition. Success depends on fully coordinating the\n\nFig. 22.10 Summary risk chart. Projects normally have many risks, so reporting typically focuses on the top ten risks for the project\n\nTable 22.7 Focused reporting of critical risks\n\nReporting element Content\n\nHeader and footer Lists project name and related identifying information\n\nIf the risk focus information is not part of a larger report, the header and footer documents the date and other\nversioning information\n\nInformation on specific\nrisks\n\nProvides the risk\u2019s title, rank, current trend, and expected closure or acceptance date\n\nRisk ID Unique ID number for each risk when it first goes into the risk database. Permits mapping of this information to any\nprevious discussion on this risk; especially important if the risk\u2019s focus changes in a minor way over time\n\nRisk statement During its evaluation we characterize risk in a construct the organization and stakeholders agree on\n\nWe express risks in one of two ways:\n\nIF {the following occurs\u2026}\u2014THEN {the consequence(s) will be\u2026}\n\nGIVEN THAT {the following can occur\u2026}\u2014THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY {that the following consequence may\noccur\u2026}\n\nApproach Repeat the project\u2019s approach to addressing the risk: research, watch, monitor, or mitigate\n\nIf this approach has changed since the last report, explain the new approach\u2019s rationale\n\nStatus Because the focus is on a risk that can strongly affect the project, explain the team\u2019s current efforts to prevent it\n\nStakeholders want more insight into risks that have the greatest effect on the project if they occur. Complete information builds stakeholder\nconfidence in the project\u2019s risk process\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 645\n\n\n\nchange across all affected parties, updating documentation\nto reflect it, annotating budget cost plans to capture the new\nplan, and focusing risk on the new baseline to ensure the\nproject has new mitigation plans.\n\nThe technology project\u2019s requirements are integrated\nwith others in the space flight project, after which all go\nunder configuration change control. As challenges arise in\nthe technology effort, the technology team must exhibit the\nsame level of discipline as the rest of the project by sub-\nmitting appropriate change-control documents. If the two\nprojects have strong collaboration and communication, this\nprocess will work efficiently.\n\nWhenever different organizations host the technology\nand space flight projects, each organization has its own\ndefined process and cultural norms for how to change the\nmission baseline. At times, this can be a source of frustra-\ntion between technologists and the project managers. The\nvery essence of change control is to limit the number of\nchanges, but technologists and their teams live in a world\nwhere they must explore ideas in order to improve and\nadvance. This tension, though natural, must be managed to\nkeep deliveries flowing smoothly to the project. At the same\ntime, technologists must oversee their laboratory procedures\nto minimize changes in delivery items.\n\n22.3.7.3 Use Management Information Systems\nAs society envisions larger, more complex systems, the\nprojects chartered to deliver these systems must develop\nnew approaches to carry out project functions, minimize\ncost, deliver in less time, and maintain the same level of\nresidual risk. That means new challenges in storing, dis-\ntributing, and protecting data. One way organizations have\nevolved to meet these challenges is by using computer-\nbased applications for library functions, electronic mail,\nreporting, and performance monitoring.\n\nWe can collect these applications for automating project\nfunctions into management information systems (MIS).\nTechnologists may expect their project to be included in the\ndeployment plan for these applications, but they must work\nwith project managers to define data-protection measures\nbefore the MIS goes operational.\n\nReporting is a multifaceted topic that warrants special\nattention, especially for missions employing new technol-\nogies. Reporting activities command a lot of the project\nmanager\u2019s and technologist\u2019s time. They must coordinate to\nreport general and specialized requirements completely.\n\n22.3.7.4 Meet Many Reporting Requirements\nfor Space Flight Projects\n\nSpace flight missions have many stakeholders whose\ndiverse interests will span aspects of the overall project,\ntechnologies, and budget. As a result, many people want to\n\nknow how the project is progressing, what challenges it is\nfacing, and what the projections are for final cost, delivery\ndate, and capabilities. Several reports are necessary to sat-\nisfy these interests.\n\nWeekly activity reports. Most organizations require a\nreport each week, in a format typically defined by the\nrequesting organization. By adhering to this format, the\nspace flight project supports organization staff who combine\nseveral reports into a larger, more general weekly report.\nConsequently, project managers and technologists need to\nsee themselves as part of a larger community who report\nstatus. Table 22.8 offers a basic format we may use to report\nweekly status if we do not have a defined format.\n\nMonthly status reports. Most organizations also require\nspace flight projects to deliver a monthly status report. The\nproject manager, or in his or her absence another senior\nproject manager, normally makes this formal report to a\ngroup of stakeholders who may or may not be advocates for\nthe project. It contains more complete status than the\nweekly report and conveys a complete snapshot of the\nproject at this one point in time. The information spans all\naspects of the space flight project, including technical,\nschedule, and budget performance. The report also incor-\nporates updates to issues, risks, and budget projections, such\nas the results of earned value management.\n\nIn some organizations, project people meet with first-tier\nline managers to provide a real-time summary of what they\nwill present. This approach adds the benefit of giving\nmanagers a chance to identify crosscutting issues that are\nbest addressed by management above the project manager.\nBecause the monthly status report is formal and complete,\norganizations typically predefine its format and share it with\nall reporting sources in the project. Table 22.9 shows the\ncontent of a typical monthly status report at GSFC.\n\nMiscellaneous status reports. Nothing draws more\nattention to a space flight project than poor performance.\nThe definition of poor performance can range from a real\ninability to progress within budget or schedule commit-\nments, to unexpected test results, to frequent changes in\nrequirements. It also can range from a perceived inability to\ncommunicate clearly and consistently with stakeholders,\nmaintain the desired attrition for project people, or negotiate\neffectively with partners or vendors. Yet, space flight pro-\njects that are not poor performers may still receive exces-\nsive interest because the mission is important to the\norganization\u2019s portfolio, it carries special subsystems (such\nas nuclear power subsystems), or the political environment\nimposes pressure on the outcomes.\n\nAs a result, project managers may expect more planned\nand unplanned requests for status information in a format\nnegotiated with the requestor or organization. Technologists\nshould be sensitive to these special factors and participate\nfully, as appropriate.\n\n646 R. J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\n\n\n22.3.7.5 Meet Reporting Requirements\nfor Technology Projects\n\nNew technologies drive innovation, which in turn drives how\nwe will remain competitive in the modern world. Therefore,\ntechnologists have their own reporting requirements to gain\nthe kinds of advantages presented in Table 22.10. Working\ntogether to ensure a coordinated approach to reporting, the\ntechnologists and project managers should discuss the\nrequirements levied on each and factor these into the project\u2019s\nbusiness rhythm. In certain instances, the reporting process\nwill not be under their control, which calls even more strongly\nfor coordination and cooperation.\n\nAvoid the natural tension that reporting can cause. In\ngeneral, reporting can cause tension between two parties,\nincluding project managers and technologists. First, as noted\nabove, technologists may feel constrained by the relatively\n\ninflexible reporting formats. Second, reporting for a space\nflight mission may be more frequent than for a technology\nproject, so it is understandable for the technologist to think,\n\u2018Didn\u2019t we just do this?\u2019 Third, projects are seldom on\nschedule, and this is no less true for technology projects.\nThese three conditions can easily produce frustration and\ntension. Add to them any team\u2019s natural bias towards opti-\nmistically assessing a project\u2019s present-day and near-term\nstatus and it is easy to see how reporting can be a challenge.\nStakeholders have reason to doubt the space flight project if\nit always presents a rosy picture but then cannot deliver the\nproducts. It is far better to have candid discussions on the\nproject\u2019s true state, including the technology effort, so that\nwe can present the necessary risk-weighted assessments.\n\nReport the \u2018right\u2019 message. The best project managers\nhave learned early in their careers that reporting is both art\n\nTable 22.8 Generic format for a weekly report\n\nWeekly report section Content\n\nFile name Give each file a unique time-based name that conveys the weekly report.

Because people will read status\nreports at a future time and without the team\u2019s direct par-\nticipation, the project\u2019s message can easily become insular\nand constrained. In short, the project reports what it would\nwant to hear, not what the stakeholders want to receive.\n\nThus, many projects deliver only half the information that\nthey should be sending out.\n\nThe most common error is failing to follow the formula:\ncomplete message = fact ? consequence. Presenters often\nmention a project event but then fail to explain cogently\nwhy it was important. By not delivering the \u2018consequence\u2019\npart of the message (positive and negative), these presenters\n\nTable 22.9 (continued)\n\nMonthly status report section Content\n\nProject resources (cost and schedule reserves,\npower and mass margins)\n\nExplain deviation from standard values for budget reserves, schedule slack, mass margin,\nand power margin in the box at bottom of chart\n\nStandard values are as follows:\n\nBudget reserves: 20 %\n\nSchedule slack: 1 month/year before Observatory integration and test (I&T), 2 months/year\nduring I&T, 1 week/month at launch site\n\nMass and power margin:\n\nAbout 25 % at PDR\n\nAbout 20 % at CDR\n\nAbout 15 % at PER\n\nAbout 10 % at end of testing\n\nAdding the percentages of estimated, calculated, and measured mass is useful\n\nExecutive summary quad chart\u2019 Typically used by senior management, who want only a summary of the report\n\nIn \u2018quad chart\u2019 format include: mission objectives, mission partners and key vendors,\ninstruments or technology being flown, overall status. For every project whose overall status\nis other than \u2018green\u2019, include a return-to-green recovery plan in the same quadrant\n\nSpace flight projects must present detailed status reports, usually monthly. This report addresses all project aspects: programmatic, technical,\nbudget, schedule, and risk\n\nTable 22.10 Drivers for technology reporting\n\nPotential reporting\nrequirement\n\nContext\n\nIdentify valuable\ntechnologies\n\nThrough active reporting of technology activities and progress, organizations and stakeholders can compile the\nmost important activities to advocate. Advocacy can lead to continued funding support, diversify the user base\nand, if a government is involved, spin off the technology to the private sector\n\nAssess commercial potential One of the technologist\u2019s goals may be the widespread adoption of a new approach, capability, or function.\nAnticipate reporting to support a decision on when to assess whether or not to spin off a technology. These\nassessments are typically routine and therefore have predefined costs\n\nProtect intellectual property Account for cost of applying for domestic and international patents, copyrights, and related protection\nmeasures. When budget is constrained, the space flight project must fund the application, so include property\nprotection in estimation templates\n\nMeet export-control\nregulations\n\nBecause technological advancements contribute strongly to a competitive advantage, they are often part of\nprotection measures at some point in a project\u2019s life cycle. Anticipate reporting to support determining\nappropriate protection measures\n\nYou won\u2019t be able to define costs for this type of reporting until the technology becomes part of a space flight\nmission. Then you can determine reporting costs\n\nChanges in partnership arrangements also may drive a corresponding change in reporting requirements.\nInclude this possibility in the cost-benefit analysis you use to determine the efficacy of a change in the first\nplace\n\nReport on organization\u2019s\nperformance\n\nYou may have to file reports with the hosting organization so the organization can meet reporting\nrequirements. In these instances, you will typically know the frequency and format, so you can incorporate the\nreporting cost in the technology project\u2019s budget estimates\n\nReporting requirements have many sources, and effective reporting can be helpful for any technology project\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 651\n\n\n\ndisregard the stakeholders\u2019 need to understand why the\nevent mattered in the first place. In short, reporting means\nbuilding advocacy over time, so that project managers and\ntechnologists can influence meetings and conversations they\nwill never attend. This influence often can help a project\nsucceed.\n\nNothing is worse for the reputation of project managers,\ntechnologists, or their projects than being questioned on the\nveracity of their reports. Managers prize being seen by the\norganization and stakeholders as an accurate source of\nreporting. At the start, everyone wants to do this, but reports\ndiverge from reality for several reasons. Human nature is\nthe main cause: the natural inclination to over-play the\npositive and under-play the negative. Understanding this\nbegs the question, \u2018How should one proceed?\u2019 Among the\nbest answers is that project manager\u2019s use reporting to \u2018set\nexpectations\u2019 and balance stakeholders\u2019 expectations with\ntheir own. Then, they take the opportunity to explain the\nplans that are in place to keep the project on track, recover\nfrom a problem, or show why reevaluating the project\u2019s\napproach is not necessary.\n\n22.3.8 Documenting Lessons Learned\n\nOrganizations, stakeholders, project managers, technolo-\ngists, and their teams want to repeat past successes.\nAlthough their intent is clear, their ways of reaching this\ngoal are not. In reality, repeating past successes can be\nelusive because no two projects are exactly the same. It does\nhappen, but not with the desired frequency and certainty, or\nwithout stressing stakeholders to their limits. Clearly, no\nsingle recipe or formula helps us address this area.\n\nAs a result, organizations have defined processes to\ncapture a team\u2019s experiences and packaged the information\nin a format that other teams can exploit. This practice is\ncommonly referred to as capturing lessons learned.\nAlthough this process is useable at any time in the life\ncycle, organizations usually mandate it as part of a space\nflight project\u2019s closeout activities. Whenever it takes place,\ntechnologists should expect to be included, and project\nmanagers should encourage their participation.\n\n22.3.8.1 Balance Lessons-Learned Databases\nwith Interpersonal Forms\n\nAlthough recording lessons learned is an excellent way to\nexamine and capture actual events, it has inherent weak-\nnesses. Thus, multiple processes are in place to help,\nranging from lesson databases to real-time knowledge\nexchanges known as \u2018master\u2019s forums\u2019. On the one hand,\ndatabase solutions allow practitioners to search through the\ninformation on their own, when they need an insight and as\n\noften as they wish. However, the amount of data that an\norganization collects will grow until it eventually becomes\ndifficult to sift through. Unless designers build the correct\nschema up front in order to control the data record format,\nkeywords, and other data-management characteristics,\npractitioners will find the process cumbersome and ineffi-\ncient as the database matures. On the other hand, master\u2019s\nforums are a great way to understand the context behind a\nlesson, the environment that drove the event, and any\nresponses to it. However, subject matter experts are\ninvariably very busy, so interactions with them are limited,\nand usually only a few practitioners can benefit from the\nexchange. The answer lies somewhere in the middle: a\nbalanced approach between databases and inter-personal\ninteractions.\n\n22.3.8.2 Take Advantage of Consolidated\nLearning\n\nGSFC\u2019s Flight Projects Directorate (FPD) has taken the\nlessons-learned concept a step further by committing\nthemselves to being a \u2018learning organization\u2019. This means\nthey emphasize more than just conveying experiences\nbetween practitioners or teams by moving toward a grander\nvision that focuses on the concept of consolidated learning.\nThis concept has arisen through extensive collaboration\nwith Dr. Edward Rogers, GSFC\u2019s Chief Knowledge Officer.\nOrganizations first must understand how practitioners learn.\nAlthough several models explain the learning process,\nFig. 22.11 illustrates the model that GSFC uses for this\ncollaborative effort.\n\nUsing the model in Fig. 22.11, the FPD\u2019s Advanced\nConcepts and Formulation Office audited GSFC\u2019s process\nfor new mission competitions. The results showed that we\nneed to add two new activities: \u2018pause and learn\u2019 and the\n\u2018kickoff workshop\u2019. Because the concept of a kickoff\n\nPause &\nLearn\n\nJob Rotation\n\nWorkshops\n\nCase Studies\n\nLessons\nLearned\n\nTeam Capture\nWorkshop\n\nFig. 22.11 Flight Projects Directorate\u2019s consolidated learning model.\nBuilding on the work of GSFC\u2019s Chief Knowledge Officer, the Flight\nProjects Directorate has audited its learning processes and intends to\naugment them as necessary in order to support learning for practitio-\nners and organizations\n\n652 R. J. Menrad and G. W. Morrow\n\n\n\nworkshop is familiar to most people who have worked on\nbusiness projects, we will discuss here only the pause and\nlearn activity. Figure 22.12 illustrates the augmented com-\npetitive process that is now in the FPD.\n\nThe foundation for consolidated learning within the FPD\nis the pause and learn [17]\u2014an interpersonal activity in\nwhich team members gather and focus on recently experi-\nenced events. Either the GSFC\u2019s Chief Knowledge Officer\nor the FPD\u2019s own knowledge manager leads this activity. A\n\npause and learn can occur at any time that practitioners or\nteams consider it appropriate to step back and discuss recent\nevents. These \u2018events\u2019 may be a short-term activity such as\npreparing for an independent review, a longer activity such\nas a single life cycle phase, or the entire duration of a space\nflight mission.\n\nThe power in a pause and learn activity comes from the\nway that it directly affects participants in many ways. First,\neach person can \u2018consolidate\u2019 his or her learning over the\n\nFig. 22.12 Competitive new\nbusiness process incorporating\nconsolidated learning. To balance\npersonal interactions and data\nmining, we must blend process\nand practitioner learning\n\nFig. 22.13 Insight-based model\nfor documenting practitioner\nlearning. How best to aggregate\nthe data challenges all data-\ncollection activities. The Flight\nProjects Directorate uses an\ninsight-based data scheme for\nnew business\n\n22 Relationship Between the Project Manager and the Technologist 653\n\n\n\nperiod being examined, which directly influences the \u2018what\nI know\u2019 aspect in Fig. 22.11. Second, other members of the\nteam get a chance to correct the underlying assumptions for\nwhy something happened in the way that it did. As a result,\nthey ensure that the individual practitioner learns the right\nlesson. This is a very important point. It is excellent to\nobserve something directly, but if practitioners incorrectly\nunderstand the underlying cause, they will find it difficult to\nuse this information later in order to anticipate a needed\naction. Interacting with the rest of the team enhances\npractitioners\u2019 ability to respond correctly to future events.\nThird, pause and learn benefits the organization that learns\nfrom its practitioners\u2019 experiences. This organizational\nknowledge can then flow into a database for use by other\nemployees assigned to similar roles and responsibilities.\nPause and learn is a powerful concept that we should con-\nsider to be part of any learning process.\n\nInsights collected during a pause and learn activity rep-\nresent valuable information for the organization and new\npractitioners. Therefore, we need databases to store, group,\nand serve up the information. How an organization handles\nthis task depends on many factors, including project size for\nthe database, diversity of the insights being uncovered, and\nthe sensitivity of the information. The FPD has chosen to\nuse an insight-based model for aggregating the information\ntaken from its new business-focused pause and learn events.\nFigure 22.13 shows an example of this scheme. Managers\nthen review the information with new practitioners during\norientation and make it available for any future inquiries.\n\nWhereas technology projects tend toward reduced doc-\numentation of requirements, costs, or schedule, space flight\nprojects swing to the other extreme. So technologists should\nanticipate the call for lessons learned and capture them in a\nformat that matches the project\u2019s database. More impor-\ntantly, technology projects should collect the data when its\nteams are doing the work, so that it will be of the highest\nquality but take the least time to produce. Although this\napproach may add a little up-front work on the team, it will\npay significant dividends later, when the space flight project\nasks for it in order to do analyses and trade studies. In short,\ntechnologists should include data collection in their own\nproject activities for the technology project\u2019s own benefit.\nNot only will the data be readily available, it may even\nmake it easier for the space flight project to defend its\ndecision to use the technology in the first place!\n\nThe best project managers manage with a sense of\nurgency but without a sense of panic. These are different\ncharacteristics and must be understood. Project managers\nhold the project\u2019s cost and schedule reserve and continually\nevaluate all risks facing it, not just those from the tech-\nnology effort. Technologists should manage their element\u2019s\ndevelopment with equal urgency.\n\n22.4 Summary\n\nA space flight mission involves many relationships. Of\nthese, the relationship between project managers and tech-\nnologists is one of the most critical. It can also be one of the\nmost challenging because these two groups live in different\nworlds. Technologists live in the world of \u2018innovation and\nfirsts\u2019, where intelligent people strive always to invent a\nnewer and better way to carry out a function or capability.\nBy contrast project managers are psychologically predis-\nposed to \u2018bound and deliver\u2019\u2014to deliver a product on time\nand on schedule by avoiding requirements creep, mitigating\nrisks as early as possible, and holding costs to the original\nestimates. The adage \u2018better is the enemy of good enough!\u2019\nbest describes a successful space flight project manager\u2019s\nmindset.\n\nBoth sides of this critical relationship must understand\nthe other. Otherwise, technologists may reasonably con-\nclude that space flight project managers are overly conser-\nvative at times, whereas the latter may conclude that\ntechnologists are never ready to stop innovating. Effective\ncollaboration should produce a dynamic tension that can\nbenefit the combined project by forcing both sides to work\nto a level of \u2018pragmatic excellence\u2019 that they might not\notherwise achieve. Still, both parties must give the rela-\ntionship genuine effort in order to ensure that it doesn\u2019t\nskew too far to one side or the other.\n\nThe successful launch, checkout, and transition to nor-\nmal operation of any spacecraft are exhilarating experi-\nences. This is especially true when the technology and space\nflight projects are able to experience these milestones as a\nfully integrated, unified project team.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Engineers and scientists increasingly express\nan interest in the legal aspects of space activities. Law is\nsometimes seen as barring technological progress by\nimposition of prescriptive rules and regulations, but the\nunderstanding that law can also protect and promote the\ninterests of space science and technology is gaining ground.\n\nInteraction between the fields of space science and\ntechnology and space law is important; a lawyer cannot make a\ngood law if he has no idea about the technological aspects\ninvolved. Likewise, it is unwise to make scientific innovations\nwithout some knowledge about the regulatory framework that\nmay embrace them. In other words, space is by definition a field\nof activity where interaction between different disciplines is\ndesirable and in fact necessary, and the multidisciplinary\ncontent of this handbook bears witness to that.\n\nIn this context, this chapter provides an overview of some\nof the main principles of international and national space law.\nIn addition, it addresses the legal aspects of two established\nactivities, namely exploration and exploitation of space, and\nthe emerging commercial human space flight industry. Other\ntopics would certainly also merit attention, for instance the\nincreasing problem of space debris, but it is impossible to\naddress all of them in detail within this context.\n\n23.1 International Space Law\n\nPerhaps the first question after finding out that \u2018space law\u2019\nexists is where outer space actually begins. This is an\nunderstandable question; however, despite the clear engi-\nneering definition given in Chap. 2, there is no firm answer.\nThe topic has been debated in the United Nations (UN) for\nseveral decades, but no agreement has been reached so far.\nVarious approaches and many theories exist and this is not\nthe place to address them all, except to say that with the\nadvent of commercial human suborbital flights (which will\nbe addressed further in this chapter), the time may soon\ncome when a boundary between airspace and outer space\nmust be defined. To date, there has been no such need, as\nactivities were either very clearly a space activity, such as\nthe building and operation of the ISS at an altitude of about\n400 km, or they were very clearly aviation, such as a\ncommercial flight between Glasgow and Amsterdam at an\naltitude of approximately 10 km.\n\nThe importance of this delimitation issue is demonstrated\nby the fact that there is a fundamental difference in the\nregimes governing air space and outer space. The first is\nsubject to sovereignty of the underlying state, whereas in\nouter space a regime of \u2018freedom\u2019 exists (be it with certain\nlimitations, of course), and no state is allowed to claim\nsovereignty over outer space or the celestial bodies.\n\nThe drafting of outer space law was initiated immedi-\nately after the launch of the first object into outer space, as\nstates were from the start convinced that regulation of\nman\u2019s activities in outer space was necessary in order to\nensure that outer space would be used for peaceful purposes\nand in an orderly manner.\n\nThe basis for the space flight regulatory environment is\nderived from Treaties and Principles developed by the\nUnited Nations. Since 1961, issues relating to the use of\nouter space have been dealt with through the United Nations\nCommittee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space\n\nT.

This resulted\nin the adoption of five UN Treaties between 1967 and 1979,\nwhich set the scene for the activities of man in outer space.1\n\n\u2022 The \u2018Treaty on principles governing the activities of\nstates in the exploration and use of outer space, including\nthe Moon and other celestial bodies\u2019 of 1967 (Outer\nSpace Treaty), serves as the \u2018Constitution\u2019 of space law.\n\n\u2022 The \u2018Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return\nof Astronauts, and the Return of Objects launched into\nOuter Space\u2019 of 1968, deals mainly with the legal status\nof astronauts in case of an accident (Rescue Agreement).\n\n\u2022 The \u2018Convention on international liability for damage\ncaused by space objects\u2019 of 1972, addresses the question\nof liability in case of damage caused by a space object\n(Liability Convention).\n\n\u2022 The \u2018Convention on Registration of Objects launched\ninto Outer Space\u2019 of 1976, creates an obligation to reg-\nister objects launched into space both with the UN and at\nthe national level (Registration Convention).\n\n\u2022 The \u2018Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the\nMoon and Other Celestial Bodies\u2019 of 1979, addresses the\nlegal status of celestial bodies and specifically the\nexploration and exploitation of natural resources of\ncelestial bodies (Moon Agreement).\n\nThe first three treaties were ratified by close to ninety states\n(100 for the Outer Space Treaty), the fourth by around fifty,\nand the last by only thirteen states so far. Major space powers\nsuch as the USA, Russia, China, India, Japan, France, the UK,\nCanada, and Germany have all ratified the first four treaties.\nNone of these states has ratified the 1979 Moon Agreement.\nSeveral international intergovernmental organizations (such\nas ESA, EUMETSAT and EUTELSAT) have declared their\nacceptance of the rights and obligations under the treaties\n(this is possible for all but the Outer Space Treaty). Many\ncountries have reflected their obligations under the treaties\nthrough the enactment of national legislation.\n\nThe membership of UNCOPUOS has now grown to\nsome seventy states, including many more space \u2018haves\u2019 but\nalso numerous space \u2018have-nots\u2019. Developing countries\nbegan to impose their view that outer space should be the\n\n\u2018\u2018Common Heritage of Mankind,\u2019\u2019 rather than the \u2018\u2018Province\nof all Mankind\u2019\u2019. This and other matters related to the Moon\nAgreement led to the move to adopt Principles rather than\nTreaties since the 1980s.\n\nThe relevant aspects of the four main international\ntreaties in relation to space regulation are presented below.\nThe Moon Agreement will be addressed in more detail in\nthe next section on exploration and exploitation.\n\n23.1.1 The 1967 Outer Space Treaty\n\nThe basic provisions contained in the Outer Space Treaty,\nalthough they were drafted more than 40 years ago in a field\nthat was subject to fast and profound technological advan-\nces, are still relevant today and are broad enough to address\na wide range of space activities\u2014even though admittedly it\nhas become necessary to draft additional rules and regula-\ntions to elaborate on the principles contained in the Outer\nSpace Treaty. The first and possibly the most important\nprinciple of space law is contained in Article I of the Outer\nSpace Treaty. It reads as follows\n\nThe exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and\nother celestial bodies, shall be carried out for the benefit and in\nthe interests of all countries, irrespective of their degree of\neconomic or scientific development, and shall be the province\nof all mankind. Outer space, including the Moon and other\ncelestial bodies, shall be free for exploration and use by all\nStates without discrimination of any kind, on a basis of equality\nand in accordance with international law, and there shall be free\naccess to all areas of celestial bodies. There shall be freedom of\nscientific investigation in outer space, including the Moon and\nother celestial bodies, and States shall facilitate and encourage\ninternational co-operation in such investigation.\n\nOf course, the concepts are not clearly defined and can\nbe subject to varying interpretations\u2014but the general idea is\nclear: use of space should somehow benefit humanity.\n\nThe second-most important principle of space law is\ncontained in Article II, which declares that outer space and\ncelestial bodies cannot be subject to appropriation by any\nmeans. It reads as follows:\n\nOuter space, including the Moon and other celestial bod-\nies, is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sov-\nereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other\nmeans.\n\nThis means that there is no \u2018territorial jurisdiction\u2019 in\nouter space, unlike on Earth or in the airspace above the\nterritory of a state. Thus, the planting of a US flag on the\nMoon during Apollo-11 in 1969 did not imply that the\nMoon had become US territory. It is forbidden to claim\nownership of any part of outer space, and this applies not\nonly to states but also to private entities, contrary to what is\nsometimes argued, because there is no sovereign authority\nthat has competence to confer titles of ownership.\n\n1 All texts, official titles and sources can be consulted on the useful\nwebsite of the Office for Outer Space Affairs in Vienna, the UN office\nsupporting the work of COPUOS. See http://www.oosa.unvienna.org,\nespecially under \u2018Space law\u2019.\n\n658 T. Masson-Zwaan and R. Crowther\n\nhttp://www.oosa.unvienna.org\n\n\nAnother important feature is that activities must be car-\nried out in accordance with international law, including the\nUN Charter, in the interest of maintaining international\npeace and security and promoting international cooperation\nand understanding (Article III of the Outer Space Treaty).\nThis means that provisions of the UN Charter such as\nArticle 2.4 and Article 51 on the duty to refrain from the\nthreat or use of force and the inherent right of self-defense\nare equally applicable to man\u2019s activities in outer space.\nArticle IV further addresses the military uses of space, and\nincludes a prohibition on placing nuclear weapons and\nweapons of mass destruction anywhere in outer space; it\nseems however that military use is not absolutely prohib-\nited, as the requirement to use space \u2018\u2018exclusively for\npeaceful purposes\u2019\u2019 only applies to the Moon and other\ncelestial bodies, and not to outer space per se.\n\nArticle V then addresses astronauts, and declares that\nstates should regard them as \u2018\u2018envoys of mankind\u2019\u2019. The\nTreaty does not provide any guidance on the meaning or\nimplications of this term, except to say that both states\nparties and astronauts of other states should render all\npossible assistance to astronauts in distress.\n\nThe treaties also contain rules concerning responsibility\nand liability (Article VI and VII of the Outer Space Treaty,\nfurther elaborated in the Liability Convention). A state is\nresponsible for \u2018\u2018national activities\u2019\u2019 in space, and a\nlaunching state is liable for damage caused by its space\nobject to another state or its natural or juridical persons,\nwhether that damage occurs in space, in the air or on the\nground. Article VI reads\n\nStates Parties to the Treaty shall bear international responsi-\nbility for national activities in outer space, including the Moon\nand other celestial bodies, whether such activities are carried on\nby governmental agencies or by non-governmental entities, and\nfor assuring that national activities are carried out in conformity\nwith the provisions set forth in the Treaty. The activities of non-\ngovernmental entities in outer space, including the Moon and\nother celestial bodies, shall require authorization and contin-\nuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty.\nWhen activities are carried on in outer space, including the\nMoon and other celestial bodies, by an international organiza-\ntion, responsibility for compliance with this Treaty shall be\nborne both by the international organization and by the States\nParties to the Treaty participating in such organization.\n\nAnd Article VII states\n\nEach State Party to the Treaty that launches or procures the\nlaunching of an object into outer space, including the Moon and\nother celestial bodies, and each State Party from whose territory\nor facility an object is launched, is internationally liable for\ndamage to another State Party to the Treaty or to its natural or\njuridical persons by such object or its component parts on the\nEarth, in air or in outer space, including the Moon and other\ncelestial bodies.\n\nIt must be noted that space law only has a system of state\nliability, i.e. a private entity or a natural person cannot present\n\na claim based on the Treaty against another state directly\nunder the Treaties but must be represented by its state; this is\nyet again an important difference with the system of air law,\nwhere for instance a passenger who suffered damage on board\nan aircraft can present a claim for damage directly to the\noperator of the aircraft. Of course a space passenger could still\npresent a claim against a space operator under national law\n(breach of contract, tort), for instance in the jurisdiction of the\nspace object or another appropriate jurisdiction.\n\nA system of dual registration has been elaborated,\nwhereby states register an object that they launch into outer\nspace both in a national register and in a central UN register,\nand jurisdiction and control are exercised by the state of\nregistry (Article VIII of the Outer Space Treaty, further\nelaborated in the Registration Convention). The requirements\nfor registration are, however, not very detailed and there have\nrecently been discussions about the need to improve them.\nThe reason is that identification of defunct objects or parts of\nsuch objects could be easier if the details given during reg-\nistration were more elaborate. This would be helpful in\ndealing with the growing problem of \u2018space debris,\u2019 although\nidentification is only one of the problems related to space\ndebris, and pieces that reenter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere are\nusually large enough to identify (another major problem\nposed by space debris being the establishment of fault for\ndamage caused in outer space itself). Regarding registration,\nArticle VIII of the Outer Space Treaty declares that\n\nA State Party to the Treaty on whose registry an object laun-\nched into outer space is carried shall retain jurisdiction and\ncontrol over such object, and over any personnel; thereof, while\nin outer space or on a celestial body. Ownership of objects\nlaunched into outer space, including objects landed or con-\nstructed on a celestial body, and of their component parts, is not\naffected by their presence in outer space, or on a celestial body,\nor by their return to the Earth. Such objects or component parts\nfound beyond the limits of the State Party to the Treaty on\nwhose registry they are carried shall be returned to that State\nParty, which shall, upon request, furnish identifying data prior\nto their return.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to mention Article IX in\nview of the next section on exploration and exploitation.\nArticle IX is the only article that addresses the problem of\ncontamination. It states that\n\nIn the exploration and use of outer space, including the Moon\nand other celestial bodies, States Parties to the Treaty shall be\nguided by the principle of co-operation and mutual assistance,\nand shall conduct all their activities in outer space, including\nthe Moon and other celestial bodies, with due regard to the\ncorresponding interests of all other States Parties to the Treaty.\nStates Parties to the Treaty shall pursue studies of outer space,\nincluding the Moon and other celestial bodies, and conduct\nexploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination,\nand also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth\nresulting from the introduction of extra-terrestrial matter, and\nwhere necessary, shall adopt appropriate measures for this\npurpose. If a State Party to the Treaty has reason to believe that\n\n23 Legal and Regulatory Issues 659\n\n\n\nan activity or experiment planned by it or its nationals in outer\nspace, including the Moon and other celestial bodies would\ncause potentially harmful interference with activities of other\nStates Parties in the peaceful exploration, and use of outer\nspace, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, it shall\nundertake appropriate international consultations before pro-\nceeding with any such activity or experiment. A State Party to\nthe Treaty, which has reason to believe that an activity or\nexperiment planned by another State Party in outer space,\nincluding the Moon and other celestial bodies would cause\npotentially harmful interference with activities in the peaceful\nexploration and use of outer space, including the Moon and\nother celestial bodies, may request consultation concerning the\nactivity or experiment.\n\nAnd lastly, Article XI must be mentioned, which\ndeclares that\n\nIn order to promote international co-operation in the peaceful\nexploration and use of outer space, States Parties to the Treaty\nconducting activities in outer space, including the Moon and\nother celestial bodies, agree to inform the Secretary-General of\nthe United Nations as well as the public and the international\nscientific community, to the greatest extent feasible and prac-\nticable, of the nature, conduct, locations, and results of such\nactivities. On receiving the said information, the Secretary-\nGeneral of the United Nations should be prepared to dissemi-\nnate it immediately and effectively.\n\nIn summary, the major points addressed by the Treaty are\n\u2022 The exploration and use of outer space shall be carried\n\nout for the benefit and in the interests of all countries and\nshall be the province of all mankind.\n\n\u2022 Outer space shall be free for exploration and use by all\nStates.\n\n\u2022 Outer space is not subject to national appropriation by\nclaim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or\nby any other means.\n\n\u2022 States shall not place nuclear weapons, or other weapons\nof mass destruction in orbit, or on celestial bodies, or\nstation them in outer space in any other manner.\n\n\u2022 The Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used\nexclusively for peaceful purposes.\n\n\u2022 States shall be responsible for national space activities\nwhether carried out by governmental or non-govern-\nmental activities.\n\n\u2022 States shall be liable for damage caused by their space\nobjects.\n\n\u2022 States shall avoid harmful contamination of space and\ncelestial bodies.\n\n\u2022 States shall regard astronauts as envoys of mankind in\nouter space, and shall render to them all possible assis-\ntance in the event of accident, distress, or emergency\nlanding on the territory of a foreign State, or on the high\nseas.\n\nThese issues are further developed by the subsequent\ntreaties.\n\n23.1.2 The 1968 Rescue Agreement\n\nThe Rescue Agreement elaborates on the provisions in\nArticle V of the Outer Space Treaty. It is slightly more\nspecific than Article V, but does not solve all the problems\nof interpretation. Interestingly, it does not use the term\n\u2018\u2018envoy of mankind\u2019\u2019 as used in the Outer Space Treaty. On\nthe other hand, it does not differentiate between professional\nastronauts or other passengers on board space objects, nor\ndoes it create special status or powers for the commander of\na space object.\n\nThe pertinent elements of the Rescue Agreement are as\nfollows. Article 5 of the Rescue Agreement declares that\n\u2022 Each Contracting Party which receives information or\n\ndiscovers that a space object or its component parts has\nreturned to Earth in territory under its jurisdiction or on\nthe high seas or in any other place not under the juris-\ndiction of any State, shall notify the launching authority\nand the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n\n\u2022 Each Contracting Party having jurisdiction over the ter-\nritory on which a space object or its component parts has\nbeen discovered shall, upon the request of the launching\nauthority, and with assistance from that authority if\nrequested, take such steps as it finds practicable to\nrecover the object or component parts.\n\n\u2022 Upon request of the launching authority, objects launched\ninto outer space or their component parts found beyond\nthe territorial limits of the launching authority shall be\nreturned to or held at the disposal of representatives of the\nlaunching authority, which shall, upon request, furnish\nidentifying data prior to their return.\n\n\u2022 Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3 of this article, a\nContracting Party which has reason to believe that a\nspace object or its component parts discovered in territory\nunder its jurisdiction, or recovered by it elsewhere, is of a\nhazardous or deleterious nature may so notify the\nlaunching authority, which shall immediately take effec-\ntive steps, under the direction and control of the said\nContracting Party, to eliminate possible danger of harm.\n\n\u2022 Expenses incurred in fulfilling obligations to recover and\nreturn a space object or its component parts under para-\ngraphs 2 and 3 of this article shall be borne by the\nlaunching authority.\nArticle 6 of the Rescue Agreement states that\n\nFor the purposes of this Agreement, the term \u2018launching\nauthority\u2019 shall refer to the State responsible for launching, or,\nwhere an international intergovernmental organization is\nresponsible for launching, that organization, provided that\norganization declares its acceptance of the rights and obliga-\ntions provided for in this Agreement, and a majority of the\nStates members of that organization are Contracting Parties to\nthis Agreement and to the Treaty on Principles governing the\n\n660 T. Masson-Zwaan and R. Crowther\n\n\n\nactivities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space,\nincluding the Moon and other celestial bodies.\n\nThe Rescue Agreement is important in establishing\ninternational responsibilities in relation to the activities and\nproperty of other state actors in case of accidents, distress,\nemergency or unintended landings. It also addresses the\nlegal status of the launching state, an important aspect of\nspace regulation, and a role, which is further elaborated in\nArticle I(c) of the Liability and Article I(a) of the Regis-\ntration Convention.\n\nIn summary, the Rescue Agreement elaborates on those\nelements of the Outer Space Treaty that deal with assistance\nto astronauts and return of objects that crash or land in a\nforeign country or on the High Seas. The agreement pro-\nvides that states shall take all possible steps to Rescue and\nassist astronauts in distress and promptly return them to the\nlaunching state. It also provides that states shall, upon\nrequest, provide assistance to launching states in recovering\nspace objects that return to Earth outside the territory of the\nlaunching state.\n\n23.1.3 The 1972 Liability Convention\n\nThe Liability Convention expands on Article VII of the\nOuter Space Treaty. The Convention has never been\ninvoked in a court case, and hence its provisions, some of\nwhich are rather vague, have never had the benefit of being\ninterpreted or clarified by case law. Some accidents could\nhave led to claims under the convention, for instance, part\nof the cost incurred for cleaning up nuclear waste caused by\nthe 1978 crash of Kosmos 954 on Canadian territory was\nreimbursed by the then USSR, but this was not done under\nthe terms of the Convention (the USSR did not admit lia-\nbility). The more recent collision between Iridium 33 and\nKosmos 2251 in 2009 also did not lead to any liability claim\nunder the Convention.\n\nThe Convention has a victim-oriented approach, and\nidentifies several states as potentially liable \u2018launching\nstates\u2019. However, a problem lies in the fact that only states\nmay present a claim. Private individuals or companies have\nno direct cause of action under the convention, but depend\non their country to present a claim to (one of) the launching\nstate(s).\n\nIn case a claim would be presented, the Convention pro-\nvides detailed rules for the establishment of a claims com-\nmission (in fact, this is the longest of all five treaties, with 28\narticles, as opposed to only ten for the Rescue Agreement).\n\nThe more pertinent elements of the Liability Convention\nare presented subsequently. In Article I, a number of\nimportant definitions are introduced\n\n\u2022 The term \u2018damage\u2019 means loss of life, personal injury or\nother impairment of health; or loss of or damage to\nproperty of states or of persons, natural or juridical, or\nproperty of international intergovernmental organizations\n(it is unclear whether only direct damage is covered or\nalso indirect damage, such as loss of revenue or emo-\ntional damage).\n\n\u2022 The term \u2018launching\u2019 includes attempted launching.\n\u2022 The term \u2018launching state\u2019 means a state which launches\n\nor procures the launching of a space object, or a state\nfrom whose territory or facility a space object is launched\n(it is rather unclear what \u2018procures\u2019 means, and states\ntend to attach different interpretations to this term).\n\n\u2022 The term \u2018space object\u2019 includes component parts of a\nspace object as well as its launch vehicle and parts\nthereof (here, it is not clear whether space debris still\nqualifies as a \u2018space object\u2019 to which liability attaches,\neven if the launching state can no longer exercise any\ncontrol over it).\n\nArticle II states that\n\nA launching State shall be absolutely liable to pay compensa-\ntion for damage caused by its space object on the surface of the\nearth or to aircraft flight (this means that the launching state is\nliable irrespective of whether it was at fault; the rationale is that\npersons or property on earth or in the air should not be vic-\ntimized by activities in outer space with which they have\nnothing to do, over which they have no control and little or no\ninformation).\n\nAnd Article III declares\n\nIn the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the\nsurface of the earth to a space object of one launching State or\nto persons or property on board such a space object by a space\nobject of another launching State, the latter shall be liable only\nif the damage is due to its fault or the fault of persons for whom\nit is responsible (in this situation, both states have engaged in\nspace activity and must therefore assume the risks of an acci-\ndent, except if one of them has committed a fault; obviously, in\nmany cases it will be difficult or impossible to establish fault for\nan accident occurring in outer space).\n\nArticle IV states that:\n\nIn the event of damage being caused elsewhere than on the\nsurface of the earth to a space object of one launching State or\nto persons or property on board such a space object by a space\nobject of another launching State, and of damage thereby being\ncaused to a third State or to its natural or juridical persons, the\nfirst two States shall be jointly and severally liable to the third\nState, to the extent indicated by the following:\n\n\u2022 If the damage has been caused to the third State on the surface of\nthe earth or to aircraft in flight, their liability to the third State\nshall be absolute;\n\n\u2022 If the damage has been caused to a space object of the third State\nor to persons or property on board that space object elsewhere\nthan on the surface of the earth, their liability to the third State\nshall be based on the fault of either of the first two States or on\nthe fault of persons for whom either is responsible.\n\n23 Legal and Regulatory Issues 661\n\n\n\nIn all cases of joint and several liability referred to in par-\nagraph 1 of this article, the burden of compensation for the\ndamage shall be apportioned between the first two States in\naccordance with the extent to which they were at fault; if\nthe extent of the fault of each of these States cannot be\nestablished, the burden of compensation shall be appor-\ntioned equally between them. Such apportionment shall be\nwithout prejudice to the right of the third State to seek the\nentire compensation due under this Convention from any or\nall of the launching States, which are jointly and severally\nliable.\n\nArticle V addresses joint liability\n\nWhenever two or more States jointly launch a space object,\nthey shall be jointly and severally liable for any damage caused.\n\nA launching State, which has paid compensation for damage\nshall have the right to present a claim for indemnification to\nother participants in the joint launching. The participants in a\njoint launching may conclude agreements regarding the\napportioning among themselves of the financial obligation in\nrespect of which they are jointly and severally liable. Such\nagreements shall be without prejudice to the right of a State\nsustaining damage to seek the entire compensation due under\nthis Convention from any or all of the launching States, which\nare jointly and severally liable.\n\nA State from whose territory or facility a space object is\nlaunched shall be regarded as a participant in a joint launching.\n\nArticle VII addresses some exemption issues by\ndeclaring that\n\nThe provisions of this Convention shall not apply to damage\ncaused by a space object of a launching State to:\n\n\u2022 Nationals of that launching State;\n\u2022 Foreign nationals during such time as they are participating in\n\nthe operation of that space object from the time of its launching\nor at any stage thereafter until its descent, or during such time as\nthey are in the immediate vicinity of a planned launching or\nrecovery area as the result of an invitation by that launching\nState.\n\nIn summary, the Liability Convention introduces defi-\nnitions for damage due to space activities and determines\nthose \u2018launching States\u2019 that could be potentially liable for\nsuch damage and the mechanisms for such claims. Elabo-\nrating on Article VII of the Outer Space Treaty, the Lia-\nbility Convention provides that a launching state shall be\nabsolutely liable to pay compensation for damage caused by\nits space objects on the surface of the Earth or to aircraft,\nand liable for damage due to its faults in space. The Con-\nvention also provides for procedures for the settlement of\nclaims for damages.\n\n23.1.4 The 1975 Registration Convention\n\nThe last of the major outer space treaties is the Registration\nConvention. It addresses the important issue of notification\n\nof activities to third parties, and establishes a key role for\nthe United Nations through its Office for Outer Space\nAffairs (UNOOSA).\n\nThe Registration Convention provides that a launching\nstate should furnish to the United Nations, as soon as\npracticable, the following information concerning each\nspace object\n\u2022 Name of launching state.\n\u2022 An appropriate designator of the space object or its reg-\n\nistration number; Date and territory or location of launch.\n\u2022 Basic orbital parameters, including\n\n\u2013 Nodal period (the time between two successive north-\nbound crossings of the equator, usually in minutes).\n\n\u2013 Inclination (a polar orbit is 90? and equatorial orbit is\n0?).\n\n\u2022 Apogee (highest altitude above the Earth\u2019s surface).\n\u2022 Perigee (lowest altitude above the Earth\u2019s surface).\n\u2022 General function of the space object.\nThis information, although useful for identifying the launch\nof a space object, has limited operational, as opposed to the\nTwo-Line Elements introduced in Sect. 2.2.3, value in\ndetermining the position of the space object once the initial\ninjection into orbit has been performed. Although the\nadoption of UN General Assembly Resolution 62/101 of 17\nDecember 2007 (\u2018Recommendations on Enhancing the\nPractice of States and International Intergovernmental\nOrganizations in Registering Space Objects\u2019) may increase\nthe efficiency of the registration process, much uncertainty\nremains, for instance in the context of transfer of ownership\nof space objects.\n\n23.1.5 Other Legal Instruments\n\nBesides the treaties discussed above and the 1979 Moon\nAgreement, a number of other important principles pro-\nduced by the United Nations have relevance to the space\nflight regulatory environment.\n\u2022 Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities\n\nof States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space,\nadopted on 13 December 1963.\n\n\u2022 Principles Governing the Use by States of Artificial Earth\nSatellites for International Direct Television Broadcast-\ning, adopted on 10 December 1982.\n\n\u2022 Principles Relating to Remote Sensing of the Earth from\nOuter Space, adopted on 3 December 1986.\n\n\u2022 Principles Relevant to the Use of Nuclear Power Sources\nin Outer Space, adopted on 14 December 1992.\n\n\u2022 Declaration on International Cooperation in the Explo-\nration and Use of Outer Space for the Benefit and in the\nInterest of all States, Taking into Particular Account the\nNeeds of Developing Countries, 1996.\n\n662 T. Masson-Zwaan and R. Crowther\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_2\n\n\nThese Resolutions do not have the same binding force as a\nTreaty, but since most of them were adopted by unanimity\nand have given rise to consistent state practice, at least some\nof the principles contained therein have become binding at\ninternational law as \u2018international custom\u2019.\n\nFurthermore, the International Telecommunication\nUnion (ITU) addresses the regulation of spectrum/orbit\nusage by spacecraft through a legal regime represented by\nthe ITU Constitution, Convention and associated Radio\nRegulations. These instruments reflect the main ITU prin-\nciples and lay down the specific regulations governing\nfrequency spectrum allocations to different categories of\nradio communication services, rights and obligations of\nMember administrations to obtain access to the spectrum/\norbit resources, and international recognition of these rights\nby recording frequency assignments, and as appropriate,\norbital positions.\n\n23.2 National Space Law\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a number of countries have reflected\ntheir obligations under the Outer Space Treaties through the\nenactment of national legislation. The focus in this chapter\nis mainly on general national laws setting out licensing\nprocedures for private entities engaging in space activities.\nStates may also have other national laws to regulate specific\nspace activities, such as remote sensing or satellite\ntelecommunications.\n\nNorway introduced its \u2018Act on launching objects from\nNorwegian territory into outer space\u2019 as early as 13 June\n1969. This was followed by Sweden in 1982 with its brief\nAct/Decree on space activities and associated licensing\nregime. The USA introduced its Commercial Space Launch\nAct (CSLA) in 1984, and the amended Commercial Space\nLaunch Amendment Act (CSLAA) followed in 2004. The\nUnited Kingdom brought into force its \u2018Outer Space Act\u2019 in\n1986. South Africa introduced its \u2018Space Affairs Act\u2019 in\n1993, and Argentina developed its National Decree relating\nto the \u2018Establishment of the National Registry of objects\nlaunched into outer space\u2019 in 1995. The Russian Federation\nenacted its Decree and statute on licensing space operations\nin 1996, closely followed by the Ukraine with its \u2018Ordi-\nnance of the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine on Space Activity\nLaw\u2019 again in 1996. Australia introduced its \u2018Space\nActivities Act\u2019 in 1998 and Brazil developed the \u2018Brazilian\nSpace Agency Administrative Edict\u2019 in 2001. The Belgian\n\u2018Law on the Activities of Launching, Flight Operations or\nGuidance of Space Objects\u2019 followed in 2005, and the\nNetherlands \u2018Space Activities Act\u2019 was enacted in 2006 and\ncame into force on 1 January 2008. France enacted the \u2018Law\non Space Operations\u2019 in 2008. In December 2011, the\nAustrian \u2018Federal Law on the Authorisation of Space\n\nActivities and the Establishment of a National Registry\u2019\nwas adopted.\n\nStates that do not have a national space law must still\nauthorize and supervise their space activities by private\nentities, but do so on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn the framework of this chapter, it is not possible to\ndiscuss all of these national space legislations, but a sum-\nmary overview of the US and some European legislations is\ngiven below.\n\n23.2.1 The United States\n\nWithin the USA, the regulation of space activities is gov-\nerned separately for government and for commercial mis-\nsions. The former are addressed as requirements by NASA,\nthe Department of Defense and other non-regulatory\norganizations. Commercial missions are handled by the\nDepartment of Transportation, the Department of\nCommerce, and the Federal Communications Commission\n(FCC). Space regulations of the Federal Aviation Admin-\nistration (FAA) of the Department of Transportation apply\nto launch vehicles and reusable spacecraft. FCC regulations\napply to satellites licensed by the FCC on behalf of the\nUnited States, and to communications by non-U.S. licensed\nsatellites with U.S. Earth stations. Commercial satellites\nperforming remote sensing functions are licensed by\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n(NOAA) within the Department of Commerce.\n\n23.2.1.1 Launches\nThe Commercial Space Launch Act (CSLA) is administered\nby the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which is\npart of the FAA. The purposes of the CSLA are to safely\nopen access to space and encourage private sector devel-\nopment, to simplify and expedite issuance and transfer of\nlaunch and reentry licenses, to promote safety, both of the\npublic and of private property, and to strengthen and expand\nspace transportation infrastructure. A license is required for\nlaunch and reentry in the United States, for launch and\nreentry by United States citizens outside of the United\nStates, for launch and reentry by United States citizens\noutside the United States and outside territory of a foreign\ncountry unless the foreign country\u2019s government has an\nagreement with the United States on jurisdiction over the\nlaunch or operation in question. A license is also required\nfor launch or reentry by a United States citizen in a foreign\ncountry if the United States has jurisdiction by agreement\nwith the government of a foreign country with respect to\nthat launch.\n\nThe license application that is submitted to the FAA by\nthe applicant is subject to a policy review, a safety review,\nand also a review of the environmental impact of the launch\n\n23 Legal and Regulatory Issues 663\n\n\n\nactivity or reentry activity. There is a requirement with\nrespect to orbital debris mitigation, and also requirements\nrelative to flight crew qualifications, training, and safety.\nThe licensee must obtain third-party liability insurance or\ndemonstrate financial ability to pay maximum probable loss\narising from third-party claims. The maximum probable\nloss is established for each license by the FAA.\n\nA launch-specific license authorizes a licensee to con-\nduct one or more launches, having the same launch\nparameters, of one type of launch vehicle from one launch\nsite. The license identifies, by name or mission, each launch\nauthorized under the license. A licensee\u2019s authorization to\nlaunch terminates upon completion of all launches autho-\nrized by the license, or at the expiration date stated in the\nlicense, whichever occurs first.\n\nA launch operator license authorizes a licensee to con-\nduct launches from one launch site, within a range of launch\nparameters, and/or launch vehicles from the same family of\nvehicles transporting specified classes of payloads. A\nlaunch operator license remains in effect for five years from\nthe date of issuance.\n\n23.2.1.2 Remote Sensing\nThe Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992 is adminis-\ntered by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-\ntration of the Department of Commerce. Its purposes\ninclude the stimulation of commercial marketing for un-\nenhanced remotely sensed data, the furthering of the long-\nterm role of commercialization of land remote sensing, and\nthe promotion of international trade and access to unen-\nhanced data on a non-discriminatory basis. The Land\nRemote Sensing Policy Act also includes licensing and\noversight responsibilities that are implemented by NOAA.\nA license is required to operate a private remote sensing\nsatellite system and when the applicant makes the appli-\ncation, the applicant must provide NOAA with the orbit and\ndata collection characteristics and any deviations therefrom.\nIncluded in the application also must be proper post-mission\ndisposal. And, finally, Government approval is required for\nany significant or substantial agreement with a foreign\nentity.\n\n23.2.1.3 Communications\nThe Communications Act of 1934 is administered by the\nFederal Communications Commission and it includes\nlicensing and operating requirements for satellites and asso-\nciated ground stations. The purposes of these provisions are to\navoid radio frequency interference, to coordinate commercial\nsatellite operations in the United States and to coordinate\ninternational satellite operations and use of the frequency\nspectrum along with the National Telecommunications and\nInformation Administration and other United States agencies,\nthrough the International Telecommunication Union in\n\naccordance with the ITU Radio Regulations. The\nCommunications Act also includes orbital debris mitigation\nrequirements, the purposes of which are to preserve continued\naffordable access to space, to continue the provision of reli-\nable United States space-based services, and to help ensure\nthe continued safety of persons and property in space and on\nEarth. To that end, an applicant is required to submit a miti-\ngation plan along with its license application and this must\ninclude end of life operation requirements consistent with\nITU requirements and ensure the discharge of on-board\nenergy sources.\n\n23.2.2 United Kingdom\n\nMany of the processes and criteria used by the UK\u2019s Outer\nSpace Act are similar to those used by the USA.\n\nThe Outer Space Act 1986 (OSA) is the legal basis for\nthe regulation of activities in outer space (including the\nlaunch and operation of space objects) carried out by per-\nsons connected with the United Kingdom. The Act confers\nlicensing and other powers on the Secretary of State acting\nthrough the UK Space Agency. The Act ensures compliance\nwith UK obligations under the international conventions\ncovering the use of outer space.\n\nUnder the legislation of the OSA, the Secretary of State\nshall not grant a license unless satisfied that the activities\nauthorized by the license will not jeopardize public health\nor the safety of persons or property, will be consistent with\nthe international obligations of the United Kingdom, and\nwill not impair the national security of the United Kingdom.\n\nFurther, the Secretary of State requires the licensee to\nconduct operations in such a manner as to prevent the\ncontamination of outer space or adverse changes in the\nenvironment of the Earth, and to avoid interference with\nactivities of others in the peaceful exploration and use of\nouter space. For example, the Secretary of State may make\nregulations that\n\u2022 Prescribe the form and contents of applications for\n\nlicenses and other documents to be filed in connection\nwith applications.\n\n\u2022 Regulate the procedure to be followed in connection with\napplications.\n\n\u2022 Authorize the rectification of procedural irregularities.\n\u2022 Prescribe time limits for doing anything required to be\n\ndone in connection with the application and providing for\nthe extension of any period so prescribed.\n\n\u2022 Require the payment to the Secretary of State of such fees\nas may be prescribed.\n\nA license describes the activities authorized by it and shall\nbe granted for such period, and is granted subject to such\nconditions, as the Secretary of State thinks fit. Further, a\nlicense may contain conditions that permit inspection by the\n\n664 T. Masson-Zwaan and R. Crowther\n\n\n\nSecretary of State of the licensee\u2019s facilities and inspection\nand testing of the licensee\u2019s equipment. It also requires the\nlicensee to provide such information as the Secretary of\nState thinks fit concerning the nature, conduct, location, and\nresults of the licensee\u2019s activities.\n\nThe Secretary of State requires the licensee to insure\nagainst liability incurred in respect of damage or loss suf-\nfered by third parties, in the United Kingdom or elsewhere,\nas a result of the activities authorized by the license. Fur-\nther, the licensee shall indemnify the government in the\nUnited Kingdom against any claims brought against the\ngovernment in respect of damage or loss arising out of\nactivities carried to which this Act applies. The requirement\nfor insurance is prescribed in the Act, however determina-\ntion of the level of insurance is at the discretion of the\nSecretary of State and during 2011 it was decided to reduce\nthe level of insurance required to 60 million Euros for a\nstandard launch/payload, consistent with many other regu-\nlatory authorities/launch service/insurance providers. In\naddition, the unlimited liability that the UK currently passes\non to the license applicant should in the future be capped to\nthe level of the insurance required. Such a change to the\nlegislation of the UK OSA requires a Legislative Reform\nOrder with Parliamentary oversight to come into effect.\n\nThe OSA provides the necessary regulatory oversight to\n\u2022 Consider public health and safety, and the safety of\n\nproperty.\n\u2022 Evaluate the environmental impact of proposed activities.\n\u2022 Assess the implications for national security and foreign\n\npolicy interests.\n\u2022 Determine financial responsibilities and international\n\nobligations.\nWhen a license is used with pre-set conditions, compliance\nmonitoring is performed to ensure that a licensee complies\nwith the Act, the regulations, and the terms and conditions\nset forth in its license. A launch licensee shall allow access\nby, and co-operate with, employees or other individuals\nauthorized by the relevant agency to observe the activities\nof the licensee, or of the licensee\u2019s contractors or subcon-\ntractors, associated with the conduct of a licensed launch.\n\n23.2.3 France\n\nThe Law on Space Operations of 2008 (Law No. 2008-518,\nof 3 June 2008, Relative to Space Operations) was enacted\nbecause France bears significant international responsibility\nas a launching state, particularly after the French state\nreceived a foreign operator\u2019s request to use the Kourou\nlaunch site in French Guyana. Accepting that request from a\nprivate operator meant assuming the eventual liability to\nthird parties deriving out of launches carried out from\nFrench territory. Therefore, the need arose to regulate\n\nauthorization and supervision, as also the consequences of\ninternational liability, of space activities carried out by non-\ngovernmental entities in France.\n\nThe authorization system set up by the law is intended to\nallow the French Government to exercise control over the\nactivities of operators likely to result in its liability as the\nlaunching state. With respect to the requirements that are\nnecessary for an authorization by the competent authority,\nthe law sets these main conditions\n\u2022 Consistency with government policy, as well as financial\n\nand professional guarantees.\n\u2022 Compliance of the envisaged activities with the Technical\n\nRegulations set down by the French Space Agency, CNES.\n\u2022 Respect for the interests of national defense, as well as\n\nFrance\u2019s compliance with its international commitments.\nThe French national law requires insurance or another\nfinancial guarantee by the operator. Details of these finan-\ncial guarantees are given in an Implementing Decree of\n2009. According to Article 6, every operator who is subject\nto an authorization in application of this law must hold and\nkeep in force, for the duration of the operation, an insurance\npolicy or other kind of financial guarantee. The current\ninsurance requirement is 60 million Euros, which is also the\nlimit of the liability of the operator (this means that the state\nwill cover any damage above this amount).\n\nCompliance with Technical Regulations is mandatory for\nspace operations by French space operators and for space\noperations from French territory. The space safety\nrequirements and regulations governing procedures are\nbased on national and international best practices and\nexperience. A critical design review of the space system and\nprocedures is to be carried out by the applicant, in order to\nverify compliance with the Technical Regulations. An\nindependent technical assessment of the operation is dele-\ngated to CNES. The Technical Regulations are divided into\nthree sections covering common requirements for the\nlaunch, control and return of a space object. A dedicated\nsection will cover specific rules to be applied at the Guyana\nSpace Centre in Kourou. The main topics addressed by the\nTechnical Regulations are the operator safety management\nsystem; the study of risks to people, property, public health\nand the Earth\u2019s environment; the impact on the outer space\nenvironment, such as space debris generated by the opera-\ntion; and planetary protection (Lazare).\n\n23.2.4 Belgium\n\nThe Belgian space law provides for a flexible regime, since\nit has very generic terms for authorization (Law on the\nActivities of Launching, Flight Operations or Guidance of\nSpace Objects, F. 2005-3027, September 2005). Article 5\nestablishes the general obligation to ensure safety of people\n\n23 Legal and Regulatory Issues 665\n\n\n\nand property, the environment, the optimal use of airspace\nand outer space, the strategic, economic and financial\ninterests of the Belgian state, and compliance with the\ninternational obligations of the Belgian state. Application of\nthe law to specific cases is left to the Belgian authorities,\nwhich may attach further conditions to each particular\nauthorization. There is no mandatory insurance under the\nBelgian law, and by a royal decree of 2008 the operator\u2019s\nliability is limited to 10 % of average operational turnover.\n\n23.2.5 The Netherlands\n\nThe Netherlands Space Activities Act, in force since 1\nJanuary 2008, also establishes a flexible licensing system\nfor private space operators, including all necessary\nrequirements such as insurance and regulation of liability\nissues (Law on Rules Concerning Space Activities and the\nEstablishment of a Registry of Space Objects, 2006). The\nAct contains a series of conditions to be complied with by\noperators, in relation to the safety of persons and property,\nenvironmental protection, public order and security, and\nfinancial security, as well as the compliance with the\ninternational obligations of the state. As usual in many\nnational space laws, sufficient insurance coverage is a key\nrequirement for granting a license. The amount of the\nrequired insurance is what the Minister considers to be\nthe maximum possible cover for the liability arising from\nthe space activities for which a license is requested, taking\ninto account what can reasonably be covered by insurance.\nThe liability of the license holder is limited to sum insured.\nThe law does not apply to activities of Dutch citizens\nabroad.\n\n23.2.6 Austria\n\nThe Federal Law on the Authorisation of Space Activities and\nthe Establishment of a National Registry was adopted by the\nAustrian Parliament on 6 December 2011 (Marboe). It was\nnecessitated by the approaching launch of two Austrian\nCubesats, and addresses, like most other national space laws,\nmainly the issues of responsibility, authorization and super-\nvision, liability and registration. It covers both activities in\nAustria as well as those carried out by Austrian nationals\nabroad. There is a mandatory insurance of 60 million Euros,\nand liability is limited to that amount, except in case of fault.\n\n23.3 Exploration and Exploitation\n\nThe current legal regime governing exploration of outer space\nand celestial bodies is laid down specifically in the Outer\nSpace Treaty and the 1979 Moon Agreement. As mentioned\n\nabove, the former has been ratified by 100 states and parts of it\ncould be said to apply even to non-parties on the basis of\nhaving become customary international law. The latter has\nonly 13 state-parties, none of which are established space\npowers (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, Kazakhstan,\nLebanon, Mexico, Morocco, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Peru,\nthe Philippines, Uruguay). Even though the Moon Agreement\nhas not been ratified as widely as the Outer Space Treaty, its\nrelevance must not be underestimated. The Outer Space\nTreaty applies to outer space, including the Moon and other\ncelestial bodies. The term \u2018celestial bodies\u2019 is however not\ndefined. The Moon Agreement is a bit more precise; it applies\nto the Moon and other celestial bodies in the solar system\nother than the Earth, and reference to the Moon includes\norbits around, or other trajectories to, or around, it. It does not\napply to extraterrestrial materials that might reach the surface\nof the Earth by natural means.\n\nExploitation of lunar resources is considered to be the\n\u2018next step\u2019 in the conquest of space after exploration, and\nmainly the reason why the Moon Agreement has remained\nof limited influence to date. The Moon Agreement is the\nonly one of the five UN space treaties that explicitly\naddresses exploitation, and discussions about the meaning\nof Article 11, declaring the Moon and its natural resources\nthe \u2018\u2018Common Heritage of Mankind,\u2019\u2019 have sparked heated\ndebate. The Moon Agreement prescribes that an interna-\ntional regime be set up to govern such exploitation,\n\u2018\u2018as such exploitation is about to become feasible,\u2019\u2019 and in\nrelation herewith the question of the review of the Moon\nAgreement was foreseen 10 years after its entry into force,\nbut this has never happened. The Moon Agreement entered\ninto force in 1984, and no decision about review has since\nbeen taken\u2014perhaps because exploitation is not yet quite\naround the corner. Despite the uncertainty about the exact\nimplications of Article 11, it is clear that exploitation is not\nprohibited per se by the Agreement.\n\nBoth exploration and exploitation will be addressed in\nthe following paragraphs. In terms of exploration, planetary\nprotection will also be discussed, and claims to private\nproperty rights on the Moon and other celestial bodies will\nbe included in the discussion regarding exploitation.\n\n23.3.1 Exploration\n\nGeneral principles from the Outer Space Treaty governing\nMoon exploration and use include\n\u2022 Freedom of scientific investigation.\n\u2022 Province of all mankind.\n\u2022 Non-appropriation.\n\u2022 Compliance with international law including the UN\n\nCharter.\n\n666 T. Masson-Zwaan and R. Crowther\n\n\n\n\u2022 Prohibition of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass\ndestruction (not defined).\n\n\u2022 International cooperation and mutual assistance.\n\u2022 Non-interference with activities of other states.\n\u2022 International (state) responsibility and liability, also for\n\nactivities carried out by private entities (which require\n\u2018\u2018authorization and continuing supervision\u2019\u2019).\n\nThe Moon Agreement adds to this, including for instance\n\u2022 Use for exclusively peaceful purposes.\n\u2022 Prohibition of threats and hostile acts.\n\u2022 Prohibition of military and weapons-related activities.\n\u2022 Sharing of information on mission and its results.\n\u2022 Report to the UN if discovery of organic life or phe-\n\nnomena endangering human life/health.\n\u2022 Notification of placement or use of radioactive materials\n\non celestial bodies.\n\u2022 Any person on the Moon is considered an astronaut;\n\nrefuge to be offered in case of distress.\n\u2022 Non-interference and consultations for surface and\n\nunderground activities/settlements.\n\u2022 (Parts of) the surface or subsurface of the Moon, or nat-\n\nural resources \u2018\u2018in place\u2019\u2019 may not become property of a\nstate, IGO, NGO, national organization, non-govern-\nmental entity or natural person.\n\n\u2022 Samples may be collected and removed for scientific\npurposes, appropriate quantities may be used to support\nmissions.\n\n\u2022 The Moon and its resources are the Common Heritage of\nMankind and an international regime is to be established\nwhen exploitation of resources is about to become\nfeasible.\n\nAs regards the important topic of the protection of the\nenvironment of celestial bodies, as indicated above, Article\nIX of the Outer Space Treaty provides a general obligation\nto protect all celestial bodies, including the Earth, from\nharmful contamination, which is not defined further. A\nsimilar provision is contained in Article 7 of the Moon\nAgreement, but it qualifies such contamination as taking\nplace \u2018\u2018through the introduction of extra-environmental\nmatter or otherwise.\u2019\u2019 An IAA Cosmic Study was recently\npublished on this subject and includes proposals such as a\ndifferentiation of space activities and areas of the Moon, a\nnew interpretation of the term \u2018\u2018due diligence,\u2019\u2019 the creation\nof \u2018\u2018planetary parks\u2019\u2019 and a model for licensing procedures\n(IAA Cosmic Study on Protecting the Environment of\nCelestial Bodies, 2011).\n\nArticle 7 of the Moon Agreement also states the possi-\nbility of creating international scientific preserves for areas\nof the Moon having special scientific interests, thus pro-\nviding an interesting means for protecting parts of the lunar\nenvironment for scientific research.\n\nCurrently attempts are being undertaken to \u2018revive\u2019 the\nMoon Agreement. Noteworthy is the 2008 Joint Statement\n\nin the UNCOPUOS Legal Subcommittee by the states\nparties, attempting to convince other states to ratify the\nTreaty by highlighting its advantages, pointing out that in\nconjunction with the Outer Space Treaty, the Moon\nAgreement is helpful for rejecting \u2018\u2018idle claims to property\nrights\u2019\u2019 that have surfaced in recent years. Also, the Inter-\nnational Institute of Space Law (IISL) has issued two\nstatements, in 2004 and 2008, about claims to private\nproperty rights in space (IISL Statements). The 2008\nstatement says\n\nInternational Law establishes a number of unambiguous prin-\nciples, according to which the exploration and use of outer\nspace, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, is per-\nmitted for the benefit of mankind, but any purported attempt to\nclaim ownership of any part of outer space, including the Moon\nand other celestial bodies, or authorization of such claims by\nnational legislation, is forbidden as following from the explicit\nprohibition of appropriation, and consequently is prohibited and\nunlawful.\n\nIt is necessary to clarify and complement the legal\nregime currently regulating the exploration and use of the\nMoon and other celestial bodies. The broad principles that\nwere adopted in the 1960s and 1970s remain valuable today\nand the delicate balance reached at that time should be\nmaintained. However, additional regulation is necessary in\norder to ensure valuable, safe, economic, and fair explora-\ntion and exploitation that will benefit both current and\nfuture generations.\n\n23.3.2 Exploration and Planetary Protection\n\n\u2018Planetary protection\u2019 is the term generally used to describe\nthe guiding principles to be adhered to in the design of an\ninterplanetary mission in such a manner as to prevent bio-\nlogical contamination of the target body, and, if appropriate,\nthe Earth. These principles arise from the scientific need to\npreserve the target planetary conditions for future biological\nand organic constituent exploration. It also aims to protect\nthe Earth and its biosphere from potential extraterrestrial\nsources of contamination in the event of a sample return\nmission.\n\nAccordingly, a spacecraft must be sterilized before\nleaving Earth in order to minimize the risk of depositing\nterrestrial biological material at the target body. Any return\nvehicle must then be designed such that the sample is\nreturned in a \u2018contained\u2019 manner with appropriate measures\nin place to dispose of any parts of the vehicle, which could\nhave been contaminated before reentry into the Earth\u2019s\nbiosphere.\n\nClean room assembly and microbial reduction through\nheat, chemicals, or radiation are the basic techniques used to\naccomplish microbial control when this is necessary for a\nmission. These add a significant burden to mission\n\n23 Legal and Regulatory Issues 667\n\n\n\ndesigners and integration teams. However, there is con-\nsensus that this is required in order to prohibit the possible\nmicrobial contamination of other planets. Article IX of the\nOuter Space Treaty states in relevant part that\n\nStates Parties to the Treaty shall pursue studies of outer space,\nincluding the Moon and other celestial bodies, and conduct\nexploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination\nand also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth\nresulting from the introduction of extra-terrestrial matter, and\nwhere necessary, shall adopt appropriate measures for this\npurpose.\n\nThe Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) has\nconcerned itself with questions of biological contamination\nand space flight since its very inception, and maintains and\npromulgates planetary protection policy for the reference of\nspacefaring nations, both as an international standard on\nprocedures to avoid organic-constituent and biological\ncontamination in space exploration, and to provide accepted\nguidelines in this area to guide compliance with the wording\nof the 1967 Treaty and other relevant international\nagreements.\n\nCOSPAR classifications as applied to different planetary\nbodies can and will change due to new scientific knowledge.\nThe discovery of extremophiles on Earth surviving tem-\nperatures that were previously thought to be lethal to all life\ndemonstrate how difficult it can be to prevent biological\ncontamination and set the appropriate levels of contami-\nnation and categorization.\n\n23.3.2.1 COSPAR Policy\nCOSPAR recognizes that although the existence of life\nelsewhere in the solar system may be unlikely, the conduct\nof scientific investigations of possible extraterrestrial life\nforms, precursors, and remnants must not be jeopardized. In\naddition, the Earth must be protected from the potential\nhazard posed by extraterrestrial matter carried by a space-\ncraft returning from another celestial body. Therefore, cer-\ntain space mission/target body combinations, controls on\ncontamination shall be imposed, as introduced in Chap. 17.\n\nAssignment of categories for specific mission/body\ncombinations is to be determined by the best multidisci-\nplinary scientific advice. For new determinations not cov-\nered by this policy, such advice should be obtained through\nthe auspices of the Member National Scientific Institutions\nof COSPAR. In case such advice is not available, COSPAR\nwill consider providing such advice through an ad hoc\nmultidisciplinary committee formed in consultation with its\nMember National Scientific Institutions and International\nScientific Unions. The five categories for mission/target\nbody type combinations and their respective suggested\nranges of requirements are presented in Table 17.4 and are\ndescribed as follows\n\nCategory I includes any mission to a target body which\nis not of direct interest for understanding the process of\nchemical evolution or the origin of life. No protection of\nsuch bodies is warranted and no planetary protection\nrequirements are imposed by the COSPAR policy. Exam-\nples of Category I missions include: Flyby, Orbiter, Lander:\nVenus; Moon; Undifferentiated, metamorphosed asteroids.\n\nCategory II missions comprise all types of missions to\nthose target bodies where there is significant interest rela-\ntive to the process of chemical evolution and the origin of\nlife, but where there is only a remote chance that contam-\nination carried by a spacecraft could jeopardize future\nexploration. The requirements are for simple documentation\nonly. Preparation of a short planetary protection plan is\nrequired for these flight projects primarily to outline\nintended or potential impact targets, brief pre- and post-\nlaunch analyses detailing impact strategies, and a post-\nencounter and end-of-mission report which will provide the\nlocation of impact if such an event occurs. Solar system\nbodies considered to be classified as Category II include:\nFlyby, Orbiter, Lander: Comets; Carbonaceous Chondrite\nAsteroids; Jupiter; Saturn; Uranus; Neptune; Pluto/Charon;\nKuiper-Belt Objects.\n\nCategory III missions comprise certain types of mis-\nsions (mostly flyby and orbiter) to a target body of chemical\nevolution and/or origin of life interest or for which scientific\nopinion provides a significant chance of contamination\nwhich could jeopardize a future biological experiment.\nRequirements will consist of documentation (more involved\nthan Category II) and some implementing procedures,\nincluding trajectory biasing, the use of clean rooms during\nspacecraft assembly and testing, and possibly bioburden\nreduction. Although no impact is intended for Category III\nmissions, an inventory of bulk constituent organics is\nrequired if the probability of impact is significant. Solar\nsystem bodies considered to be classified as Category III\ninclude: Flyby, Orbiters: Mars; Europa.\n\nCategory IV missions comprise certain types of mis-\nsions (mostly probe and lander) to a target body of chemical\nevolution and/or origin of life interest or for which scientific\nopinion provides a significant chance of contamination\nwhich could jeopardize future biological experiments.\nRequirements imposed include rather detailed documenta-\ntion (more involved than Category III), including a bioassay\nto enumerate the bioburden, a probability of contamination\nanalysis, an inventory of the bulk constituent organics and\nan increased number of implementing procedures. The\nimplementing procedures required may include trajectory\nbiasing, clean rooms, bioload reduction, possible partial\nsterilization of the direct contact hardware and a bioshield\nfor that hardware. Generally, the requirements and com-\npliance are similar to the Viking missions, with the\nexception of complete lander/probe sterilization. Category\n\n668 T. Masson-Zwaan and R. Crowther\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_17\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_17\n\n\nIV specifications for selected solar system bodies are set\nforth in the Appendix to this document. Solar system bodies\nconsidered to be classified as Category IV include: Lander\nMissions: Mars; Europa.\n\nCategory V missions comprise all Earth-return missions.\nThe concern for these missions is the protection of the\nterrestrial system, the Earth and the Moon. (The Moon must\nbe protected from back contamination in order to retain\nfreedom from planetary protection requirements on Earth-\nMoon travel.) For solar system bodies deemed by scientific\nopinion to have no indigenous life forms, a subcategory\n\u2018unrestricted Earth return\u2019 is defined. Missions in this sub-\ncategory have planetary protection requirements on the\noutbound phase only, corresponding to the category of that\nphase (typically Category I or II). For all other Category V\nmissions, in a subcategory defined as \u2018restricted Earth\nreturn\u2019, the highest degree of concern is expressed by the\nabsolute prohibition of destructive impact upon return, the\nneed for containment throughout the return phase of all\nreturned hardware which directly contacted the target body\nor unsterilized material from the body, and the need for\ncontainment of any unsterilized sample collected and\nreturned to Earth. Post-mission, there is a need to conduct\ntimely analyses of any unsterilized sample collected and\nreturned to Earth, under strict containment, and using the\nmost sensitive techniques. If any sign of the existence of an\nextraterrestrial replicating entity is found, the returned\nsample must remain contained unless treated by an effective\nsterilizing procedure. Category V concerns are reflected in\nrequirements that encompass those of Category IV plus a\ncontinuing monitoring of project activities, studies and\nresearch (i.e. in sterilization procedures and containment\ntechniques). \u2018Restricted Earth return\u2019 would include Mars\nand Europa, whereas \u2018unrestricted Earth return\u2019 would\nrelate to the Moon.\n\n23.3.2.2 Reporting\nCOSPAR recommends that its members provide informa-\ntion to COSPAR within a reasonable time (not to exceed six\nmonths after launch) about the procedures and computa-\ntions used for planetary protection for each flight, and again\nwithin one year after the end of a solar system exploration\nmission about the areas of the target(s) which may have\nbeen subject to contamination. COSPAR maintains a\nrepository of these reports, makes them available to the\npublic, and annually delivers a record of these reports to the\nSecretary General of the United Nations.\n\nThe Reports should include, but not be limited to, the\nfollowing information\n\u2022 The estimated biological burden at launch, the methods\n\nused to obtain the estimate (e.g. assay techniques applied\nto spacecraft or a proxy), and the statistical uncertainty in\nthe estimate.\n\n\u2022 The probable composition (identification) of the biolog-\nical burden for Category IV missions, and for Category V\n\u2018restricted Earth return\u2019 missions.\n\n\u2022 Methods used to control the biological burden, decon-\ntaminate and/or sterilize the space flight hardware.\n\n\u2022 The organic inventory of all impacting or landed space-\ncraft or spacecraft-components, for quantities exceeding\n1 kg.\n\n\u2022 Intended minimum distance from the surface of the target\nbody for launched components, for those vehicles not\nintended to land on the body.\n\n\u2022 Approximate orbital parameters, expected or realized, for\nany vehicle which is intended to be placed in orbit around\na solar system body.\n\n\u2022 For the end-of-mission, the disposition of the spacecraft\nand all of its major components, either in space or for\nlanded components by position (or estimated position) on\nthe surface of a celestial body.\n\n23.3.3 Exploitation\n\nThe major challenge in creating a workable regime for the\nexploitation of outer space resources is to find the right\nbalance between \u2018\u2018benefit and interests of all countries\u2019\u2019 as\nproclaimed in Article I of the Outer Space Treaty. And, the\nequally vital need for return on investment and legal cer-\ntainty for entrepreneurs\u2014that need has also been explicitly\nrecognised in the 1996 \u2018Declaration on International\nCooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for\nthe Benefit and in the Interest of all States, Taking into\nParticular Account the Needs of Developing Countries\u2019\n(UN Res. 51/122, 1996, the so-called \u2018Space Benefits\u2019\nDeclaration). This Resolution, on the one hand, says that\ninternational cooperation in the exploration and use of outer\nspace must take particular account of the needs of devel-\noping countries. While on the other hand, it recognizes that\nstates are free to determine all aspects of their participation\nin such cooperation on an equitable and mutually acceptable\nbasis, and that contractual terms should be fair and rea-\nsonable and should comply with the legitimate rights and\ninterests of the parties concerned (e.g. intellectual property\nrights).\n\nParallels for the regime governing the exploration and\nexploitation of the Moon can be found in the Law of the Sea\nregime and in the Antarctica regime. The Law of the Sea\nregime also contains the term \u2018\u2018Common Heritage of Man-\nkind\u2019\u2019 with regard to resources of the deep seabed. Sub-\nsequent amendments have attempted to bring the system\nmore in line with political and economic realities, and thus\nmore readily acceptable by all states. As far as the Antarctic\nregime is concerned, the situation is somewhat different, as\nseveral states have claimed sovereign rights over the area,\n\n23 Legal and Regulatory Issues 669\n\n\n\nwhich have subsequently been \u2018frozen\u2019 but which are still\n\u2018around\u2019 (this is not the case for the celestial bodies or parts\nthereof). In 1991 the \u2018Consultative Parties\u2019 (i.e. the most\ninterested parties with regard to these claims) decided to\nrefrain from mining Antarctica and to \u2018\u2018commit themselves to\nthe comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment\nand dependent and associated ecosystems and hereby desig-\nnate Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and\nscience\u2019\u2019. The mineral resources of Antarctica have not been\ndeclared the \u2018\u2018Common Heritage of Mankind\u2019\u2019 (PEX Report;\nTowards a Global Space exploration Program: a Stepping\nStone Approach, COSPAR Panel on Exploration, 2010).\n\nIn the light of this, one may wonder whether it is nec-\nessary to \u2018renegotiate\u2019 or otherwise amend the Moon\nAgreement, in order to establish an \u2018authority\u2019, like in the\nLaw of the Sea regime, for example, or to transform it into\nsomething more similar to the Antarctic Treaty System.\n\n23.3.4 Exploitation and the Role of Private\nEnterprise\n\nHaving established that exploration and exploitation of\ncelestial bodies and their resources are permitted, albeit on\ncertain conditions, another question that arises is whether\nthey may be carried out by entities other than the state,\nnamely by private enterprise. Article VI of the Outer Space\nTreaty states, in relevant part, that states parties must assure\nthat national activities are carried out in conformity with the\nprovisions set forth in the present Treaty, and must carry out\nauthorization and continuing supervision over the activities\nof non-governmental entities in outer space, including the\nMoon and other celestial bodies.\n\nArticle 11 of the Moon Agreement further specifies that\nneither the surface nor the subsurface of the Moon, nor any\npart thereof or any natural resources in place, shall become\nproperty of any state, international intergovernmental or\nnon-governmental organization, national organization or\nnon-governmental entity or of any natural person.\n\nIt is thus clear that as long as some criteria are met,\nprivate entities are allowed to carry out activities in outer\nspace. These requirements are further refined in other\ninstruments, such as the 1972 Liability Convention. A state\n(i.e. the \u2018appropriate\u2019 state\u2014some controversy exists as to\nwhether that means the state of incorporation, main place of\nbusiness, or otherwise) must authorize and supervise the\nprivate entity, and remains internationally responsible for its\nactivities. This is increasingly being considered to be best\nensured by way of a national licensing scheme\u2014even rec-\nognized by the UNCOPUOS, and as discussed above, more\nand more states have taken that advice to heart and have\ndesigned or are thinking about developing national legis-\nlation in that sense.\n\n23.3.4.1 The Need for Private Enterprise\nThe observation that private entities are allowed to under-\ntake space activities, including exploration and exploitation\nof outer space as long as they fulfill certain requirements is\nimportant because the role of private enterprise increases by\nthe day. The space treaties were drafted at a time when\nprivate enterprise was still far away, or private companies\nacted as contractors for the government. Nowadays they are\nmore often than not the primary players, although some\nstates still consider that space activities should be carried\nout only by governmental entities.\n\nThis means that the space treaties, although they allow\nand regulate the basics for private enterprise, do not settle\nall details, such as the exact nature of the relations between\ngovernment and private entities, or the relations between\ndifferent private entities. These details need to be worked\nout, and this can be done in the spirit of, and without nul-\nlifying, the existing treaties. Private enterprise today has\nbecome essential for further exploration and exploitation, it\nhas brought economies of scale and arguably has even\nassured the continuation of space activity, and must be\nencouraged and facilitated by further elaboration of the\nexisting legal frameworks. This must also be seen against\nthe backdrop of ever more and closer international coop-\neration, which entails further complexities and interrela-\ntionships\u2014as embodied in the International Space Station\n(ISS).\n\nThe requirement for authorization and continuing\nsupervision (Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty) provides\na significant measure of protection to private entities. The\nobligation to prevent harmful interference (Article IX of the\nOuter Space Treaty) means that in the event of harmful\ninterference, international consultations could be con-\nducted, or liability could be imposed, and there even is a\nduty to take part in such consultation when interference\noccurs.\n\nIn addition, one level down from the international trea-\nties, the positive effects of national licensing schemes must\nbe reemphasized. They contribute to an atmosphere of\nincreased clarity and certainty. A state that grants a license\nto a private entity is unlikely to interfere with a project that\nis being operated in a legal and lawful manner. The\nlicensing state is also unlikely to license another private\nentity to directly interfere with a previously authorized\nmission, and can take actions to protect the interests of\nprivate entities operating under its license, although it could\nrevoke a license, cancel a frequency assignment, etc.\nIntellectual property rights claims could be also brought, or\nclaims against unfair competition (Masson-Zwaan, Lunar\nexploration and exploitation etc., 2008).\n\nRegrettably, some recent projects that seek to make a\nprofit at any cost are undermining the balance and con-\nsensus that has been reached over the past 40 years. They\n\n670 T. Masson-Zwaan and R. Crowther\n\n\n\nargue that space law does not protect their interests, and\neven prevents them from making a profit. They are espe-\ncially critical of Article II of the Outer Space Treaty and the\nnon-appropriation principle. It is accepted that the non-\nappropriation principle of Article II also forbids any private\nclaims. It has been argued that use of the term \u2018national\u2019\nappropriation exempts private entities, and therefore per-\nmits so-called \u2018private appropriation\u2019, but to date no per-\nsuasive arguments have been offered to justify this\ninterpretation. It is a firmly established principle of inter-\nnational law, recognized by all, that a state can never grant\nmore authority to a non-governmental entity than it pos-\nsesses itself. Thus, states cannot authorize and license their\nnationals to appropriate outer space and celestial bodies,\nwhich is prohibited to the state itself under international\nlaw. The IISL Statements cited above conclude that the\nprohibition of national appropriation by Article II includes\nappropriation by non-governmental entities. The 2008\nStatement intentionally ends on a positive note, by recalling\nthat private activities on the Moon and other celestial bodies\nare permitted as long as they are in accordance with inter-\nnational space law, and subject to the authorization and\ncontinuing supervision of the appropriate state party.\n\nMoreover, private ownership of celestial property is not\neven necessary for commercial use of resources, even on\nEarth. A private entity can perfectly legally and profitably\nextract and use resources from property that it does not\nown: think of offshore oil platforms or fisheries zones.\n\nThe relations between government and private entities\nneed to be further regulated. More national licensing schemes\nneed to be elaborated and promoted in many more countries.\nIf possible in a framework of international consultation and\ncoordination, possibly under the umbrella of UNCOPUOS,\nand of course the space law community must continue and\nintensify its efforts to convince their own, as well as\u2014or even\nmore so\u2014engineers, scientists and politicians, that law and\norder in space can promote and encourage progress, as long as\nit is developed wisely, in a concerted effort between all parties\nconcerned, and continuously evaluated and adapted to\nchanging needs of all stakeholders.\n\n23.4 Private Commercial Human Space\nFlight\n\nTechnological novelties never stop challenging lawyers\u2019\nabilities to adapt themselves, and the law, to new and\nunforeseen situations. This is especially so with regard to\nactivities taking place in the sky and beyond. In the\nbeginning, a law for activities in the atmosphere (or air\nspace) was formulated. Next, a law of outer space came into\nbeing. In the near future, a novelty will come about that\n\ndoes not quite fit into either of these categories, or maybe\nconsidered to fall under both. This new activity is often\nreferred to as (suborbital) space tourism. Is it aviation or\nspace flight, or something new and hybrid that should per-\nhaps be called aerospace flight? Are vehicles that will be\nused aircraft or spacecraft, or something new and hybrid,\nperhaps called aerospace craft?\n\n23.4.1 Categories of Space Travel\n\nThere are basically three categories of private commercial\nhuman space travel, which are briefly outlined below,\nalthough the emphasis in the remainder of this chapter will\nbe on the first of these (see Masson-Zwaan, Article VI etc.,\n2009).\n\n23.4.1.1 Suborbital Flights\nIn suborbital space flight, orbital velocity is not achieved.\nAfter engine shutdown, 3\u20136 min of weightlessness is\nachieved, after which the vehicle falls back to Earth and\nreenters the atmosphere. Most current projects for private\ncommercial human space flight will offer this kind of \u2018space\ntravel\u2019. Vehicles usually attain a maximum altitude of\naround 100 km. Different technologies are under consider-\nation. Some concepts involve a horizontal takeoff or launch\n(sometimes from an aircraft), while others take off verti-\ncally. For landing, they can vary from aircraft to parachute,\nthe main technology challenge being thermal protection\nduring reentry. Some see suborbital flights as equivalent to\nsounding rockets, not requiring licensing as either aircraft or\nspacecraft; however there is no (international) agreement\nyet as to the exact status of these flights, and the fact that\nthey intend to carry commercial passengers and cargo cer-\ntainly seems to differentiate them substantially from\nsounding rockets.\n\nPerhaps the most renowned enterprise in this category is\nVirgin Galactic. The concept involves a launch of Space-\nShipTwo in mid-air at 50,000 feet ([15 km) from the\nmothership, an aircraft called WhiteKnightTwo. Its home\nbase will be Spaceport America in New Mexico, USA, but\nflights are also planned from other sites around the world.\nThe 2? h journey into space sells for US$200,000 per seat,\nand hundreds of people have reportedly already signed up.\n\nXCOR Aerospace is developing the two-seat Lynx sub-\norbital spaceplane. The spaceplane will be capable of flying\nseveral times each day, with flights being retailed by Space\nExpedition Corporation (SXC). SXC may preempt Virgin\nGalactic in being the first to start commercial operations,\npossibly from Cura\u00e7ao in the Caribbean, under a \u2018wet-lease\u2019\nagreement with Space Expedition Cura\u00e7ao. Tickets sell for\nUS$95,000.\n\n23 Legal and Regulatory Issues 671\n\n\n\n23.4.1.2 Orbital Space Flight\nIn orbital space flight, orbital velocity must be achieved for\nthe vehicle to keep flying along the curvature of the Earth\nand not fall back. Orbital space flight is technically highly\ncomplex and therefore expensive. Providing orbital space\nflight for private paying clients is much more demanding\nthan suborbital flight, both in terms of technology and cost,\nbut is nevertheless envisaged by several ventures, following\nin the footsteps of the seven private individuals who have\nflown on Russian spacecraft to the ISS. In April 2001, the\nfirst commercial space tourist Dennis Tito (born 1940) spent\nsix days in the Russian section of the ISS, after extensive\ntraining at the Star City complex. Such flights are marketed\nby Space Adventures. The price for a flight to the ISS on\nboard a Soyuz spacecraft is around US$35 million. Seats\nhave become scarce since the International Space Station\ndoubled its crew size up to six people in May 2009, because\nthere are now no spare seats available on the Soyuz flights.\n\n23.4.1.3 Intercontinental Rocket Transport\nIntercontinental rocket transport implies a transit through\nspace in order to substantially shorten the travel time from\none point on Earth to another. It is not a new idea, but the\ntechnical challenges are very demanding in terms of the\nvelocity and the amount of propellant required, and the need\nfor robust thermal protection for reentry. Cost is therefore\nprohibitive, at least in the short to medium term.\n\n23.4.2 Realities\n\nAs several market studies have shown (e.g. Futron Space\nTourism Market Studies, 2002, 2006), it is certain that space\ntourism will happen. The basic legal framework for private\ncommercial space activity is in place, although the extent to\nwhich humankind might one day engage in commercial\nspace tourism activities was not anticipated. More and more\nlicensing systems are being put in place under national law,\ncomplementing the international legal framework, which\nwill help to provide legal certainty and harmonized rules.\nRegulatory and legal certainty in this field is important for\nnew industries but also for passengers and third parties.\n\nMass tourism is probably still several decades away. When\nticket prices come down to US$20\u201340,000, the numbers of\npassengers is likely to increase, as the prospect of experi-\nencing weightlessness and observing the \u2018Blue Planet\u2019 from\nouter space is very attractive to many people. For the\nimmediate future, it will be only for the rich few, at consid-\nerable personal risk, liability for which they will be requested\nto waive, while insurance may not yet be available.\n\n23.4.3 Regulatory Needs\n\nThe multilateral space treaties elaborated within UNCOP-\nUOS were formulated in the Cold War era, when only a\nsmall number of countries had spacefaring capability. They\ncould not fully anticipate the extent to which humankind\nwould one day engage in commercial space tourism activ-\nities. The Outer Space Treaty foresaw that private entities\nwould one day engage in space activities, yet one of the\nmost essential topics for private operators, namely their\nexposure to second- or third-party liability, is not addressed.\nSecond party or contractual liability refers to liability of the\noperator vis-\u00e0-vis passengers and cargo, while third-party or\nnon-contractual (tort) liability refers to liability for damage\nto persons or property on the ground, who have no con-\ntractual relations with the activities of the operators.\n\nInstead, the Treaty, as well as the Liability Convention,\nonly addresses liability at the level of the states involved.\nThere is no cap on liability of operators, and no opportunity\nfor passengers or third parties to present direct claims for\ncompensation. Thus, even though the Treaties maintain\ntheir relevance even after several decades, the existing\ninternational legal regime needs to be supplemented with\nadditional and more specific rules. Once again, a balance\nmust be found between commercial and technological\nopportunities on the one hand and principles of international\nspace law on the other, and between the interests of the state\nand those of private enterprise and passengers and third\nparties. In essence, it is necessary to protect the legitimate\ninterests of states and to ensure the safety of crew, pas-\nsengers and third parties in a satisfactory way, without\ncreating a regulatory overkill.\n\n23.4.4 Does International Space Law or Air Law\nApply to Space Tourism?\n\nThe UN space law treaties apply to relations between states\nin carrying out space activities. International air law con-\nventions deal with international carriage by air.\n\nMany of the currently planned space tourism projects\nplan to operate from one state, i.e. they will take off and\nland at one and the same spaceport. In these cases, the\nlikelihood of international legal issues such as cross-border\ndamage is limited, and in principle that state\u2019s national law\nwill apply. Most ventures are currently planned to take\nplace in the USA. Here, no international element will be\ninvolved, and the state may determine whether it will reg-\nulate the activity as an aviation or space activity under its\nnational law.\n\n672 T. Masson-Zwaan and R. Crowther\n\n\n\nThe USA has developed a substantive body of rules\ngoverning private human space flight. A \u2018light touch\u2019 legal\napproach has been taken, and licenses from the FAA\u2019s\nOffice of Commercial Space Transportation are mainly\nconcerned with public safety, not so much with the safety of\npassengers (who are voluntarily engaging in a risky activ-\nity). However, there are other cases where the probability of\nan international element, and thus the applicability of\ninternational air or space law, is much less remote; for\ninstance, when such a mission would launch from a site in\nEurope. Countries in Europe are much smaller and so the\npossibility of cross-border damage is greater. This could\nthen lead to damage being caused by (the private entity of)\none state to persons or property of another.\n\nEven though some states in Europe have enacted national\nspace legislation creating a licensing system, as discussed\nabove, none of these contain specific rules on space tourism.\nThe Dutch Act contains a provision stating that it can be\ndeclared \u2018\u2018wholly or partly applicable to the organization of\nouter space activities by a natural or juridical person from\nwithin the Netherlands\u2019\u2019 (Sec. 2.2 b). The explanatory note\nspecifies \u2018\u2018This might include the commercial organization\nof space tourism activities.\u2019\u2019 Note that the Dutch Act does\nnot apply to Cura\u00e7ao (from where Space Expedition Cor-\nporation (SXC) will operate the XCOR Lynx). Cura\u00e7ao\nbecame a separate state in 2010 and does not yet have a\nnational space law. Sweden, which may become involved as\na launch site in Kiruna, might treat a vehicle such as\nSpaceShipTwo as a sounding rocket, which under its cur-\nrent act is not regarded as a space activity.\n\nEfforts at harmonization of space legislations in Europe\nseem to be barred by Article 189 of the Lisbon Treaty of\n2009, and the risk is a patchwork of rules will result that\nmay ultimately lead to flags of convenience and \u2018forum\nshopping.\u2019 Some representatives of the European Aviation\nSafety Agency (EASA), the European counterpart of the\nFAA, have expressed their view since 2008 that EASA is\ncompetent to regulate suborbital flights, but only for hori-\nzontal takeoff concepts such as SpaceShipTwo, and only for\nthe part that takes place in the air. They have taken a less\nflexible approach than the FAA, basically considering these\ncraft to be aircraft, calling them suborbital aeroplanes\n(SOA), and requiring full certification at the start of com-\nmercial operations (Marciacq e.a.). In the fall of 2011, the\nEuropean Commission asked EASA to put all rule-making\nactivities in the field of suborbital flights on hold, for bud-\ngetary reasons. This means that regulation of such flights\nwill have to be regulated under national law\u2014as long as no\ninternational element is involved in the course of the flight.\n\nIn the situation where an international element warrants\nthe application of international law, the question is whether\n\nair or space law would apply to damage. There are major\ndifferences in both regimes. In air law, passenger liability\nand the liability of the operator towards third parties on the\nground is laid down in an elaborate system of rules that\nhave been tested and clarified extensively by jurisprudence,\nwhile space law is based on a rudimentary state-based\nsystem of liability that has moreover never been put to the\ntest in a court case.\n\nUnfortunately, neither air law nor space law provides\ndefinite answers, either in international instruments or in\nnational laws, about whether \u2018space tourism\u2019 could be\ncovered by the respective legal regimes. At the international\nlevel, space law provides no definition or delimitation of\nspace, nor a precise definition of spacecraft or space object,\nbut it would appear to be relatively easy to conclude that\nspace tourism could fall under the space law regime. In\ninternational air law, there is a definition of aircraft (\u2018\u2018Any\nmachine that can derive support in the atmosphere from the\nreaction of the air other than the reaction of the air against\nthe earth\u2019s surface\u2019\u2019, see the ICAO Annexes). However,\ndespite the technical definition discussed at the start of\nChap. 2 and referred to as the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n ellipsoid, there is\nno legal definition of where airspace ends; to be covered by\nair law, the definition of aircraft may need to be reinter-\npreted to include suborbital space flights. Thus, it would\nappear that under current international or national air or\nspace law there is no definite answer yet about the legal\nstatus of suborbital space tourism.\n\nSo, should air law apply for part of the journey and space\nlaw at some (as yet undefined) point during the activity? Is\nthe case different for suborbital flights and for orbital\nflights? And, what about horizontal (aircraft) takeoff as\nopposed to vertical (rocket propelled) takeoff (or suborbital\nflights versus orbital flights)? The application of two totally\ndifferent regimes to one suborbital flight may be the result;\nthis would be both unsatisfactory and impractical. Of\ncourse, ideally, a comprehensive and uniform \u2018hybrid\u2019 legal\nregime of aerospace law should cover the complete launch\nand return journey of private individuals. Such a regime\nmay well require a new Treaty, but the probability of states\nagreeing on a new Treaty is not high and might take\ndecades.\n\nSince there is a need to provide clarity to today\u2019s\nentrepreneurs and to safeguard the interests of all players\ninvolved, an interim solution could be to apply space law to\nthe entire suborbital flight, on the basis of the function of\nthe vehicle or mission. Since the purpose of space tourism is\nto go to space, space law might be applied to the entire\nmission. But, appropriate clarifications and additions (per-\nhaps based on the model of the US regulations) must be\nmade to supplement the provisions of the space treaties, and\n\n23 Legal and Regulatory Issues 673\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_2\n\n\nnational legislation should address this activity as much as\npossible\u2014as a case in point, more EU member states should\nenact national legislation in this field.\n\n23.5 Conclusion\n\nThe general legal framework for space activities under\npublic international law as contained in the UN treaties is in\nplace, and is sufficiently general and flexible to enable and\nencourage states to carry out space activities in an orderly\nmanner. It contains the basic provisions that allow states to\naddress the legal implications of space activities. But it is\nalso clear that the time has come for the international\ncommunity to agree on the further development of these\ngeneral principles, to deal with emerging issues such as\nexploration, planetary protection, exploitation, the interests\nof private entities or private human space flight; and cer-\ntainly the problems related to space debris mitigation and\nremediation require attention. Such rules can of course be\nlaid down in the form of treaties, but other forms such as\nnational legislation, guidelines, codes of conduct and the\nlike may be more efficient and realistic in the short to\nmedium term. In creating this additional legal framework\nimplementing the basic principles laid down in the UN\nspace treaties, ideally in the form of guidelines and other\n\u2018modern\u2019 forms of international law, a continuous interac-\ntion between scientists, engineers and lawyers will remain\nof paramount importance.\n\n23.6 Sources and Further Reading\n\nOn space law in general:\nTexts of Treaties and Resolutions:\n\n\u2022 http://www.oosa.unvienna.org/oosa/en/SpaceLaw/index.\nhtml\nSpace Law\u2014A Treatise, F.

Space science and explora-\ntion are expensive, and without a well-defined and justifiable\nneed, no one is going to commit significant funding for any\nspace endeavor. However, as discussed in Chap. 1, applica-\ntions of space technology are many and broad, hence there are\nmany ways to determine and establish a mission need.\n\nRobotic science missions are justified by their science\nreturn. To be selected for flight, questions like these must be\naddressed: What is the principal science question that needs\nanswering, and will the proposed mission be the most cost-\neffective way to answer it? Why does answering the question\nrequire an expensive space flight, instead of some ground-\nbased alternative? If the question can only be answered by\nflying in space, then why is this approach better than other\npotential approaches? How much will it cost? And is the\ntechnology required to answer the question in-hand and\nready to use? If not, then how much will it cost and how long\nwill it take to mature the technology to a usable level?\n\nThere are also many ways to justify human exploration\nmissions, including science return, technology advancement,\nas well as intangible reasons, such as \u2018national pride\u2019.\nNonetheless, many of the questions that need answering are\nsimilar to those for robotic science missions: Where are the\npeople going, why, and will the proposed mission be the most\ncost-effective way to get there? What is the safest method to\nachieve the goal? How much will it cost? And is the tech-\nnology required to get there and keep the crew alive in-hand\nand ready to use? If not, then how much will it cost and how\nlong will it take to mature the technology to a usable level?\n\nAnother reason for some groups sending spacecraft into\nspace is for profit. Telecommunications, geospatial\n\nimaging, and tourism are examples of proven, market-dri-\nven space missions and applications. For this specific set of\nusers, the outstanding questions include: What is the prod-\nuct or service? Who will buy it? How can it be profitable?\nWhat is the most cost-effective solution to fielding the\nproduct or service? And, of course, is the technology\nin-hand or is further development required?\n\nIn order to answer these questions, the responsibility falls\nto a specially skilled set of engineers and scientists who\nunderstand how to assess the readiness of new technologies.\nThis is a process of defining preliminary mission require-\nments, and the methodologies for assessing multiple can-\ndidate mission implementation scenarios against each other\nto achieve a point design for cost assessment, management\nreview, and sometimes approval to proceed with develop-\nment. This chapter will describe and discuss these advanced\nconcept assessments.\n\n24.1 An Advanced Concepts Team\n\nThe specific skill mix and organization structure of an\nadvanced concepts analysis team will vary with separate\norganizations. Some organizations will have a dedicated team\nof discipline engineers skilled in making high level, rapid\nturnaround concept studies funded and available when new\nanalyses are required. Other organizations maintain only a\ncore set of advanced concept managers, with discipline\nexpertise obtained by \u2018buying it\u2019 from elsewhere within the\norganization, as and when specific studies need to be per-\nformed. Both approaches have been proven successful; the key\nis the attitude and training of the individual team members.\n\nA successful space system advanced concepts analysis\nteam will have experts in the following fields engaged in\nstudies, as their skills are needed\n\u2022 Study Manager\u2014The primary interface with the customer\n\nor the innovator. This is the person that understands the\n\nL. Johnson (&) ? J. Mulqueen\nGeorge C.

The Study Manager also\ndevelops the budget and staffs the team with the appro-\npriate discipline experts for the assigned task. This person\nis also responsible for documenting the results of the\nanalysis and providing it to the customer. It is also\ndesirable for this person to report the results at a relevant\ntechnical conference or in a journal article, as appropriate.\n\n\u2022 Lead Systems Engineer\u2014This is ideally an experienced\nengineer who has seen at least one advanced concept\nfrom the idea phase through hardware development or\nspace flight. It is their responsibility to make sure that the\nstudy products are wholly integrated, that they are\ninternally consistent with all the study\u2019s ground rules and\nassumptions, and that there are no unforeseen system-\nlevel impacts resulting from any single team member\u2019s\ntechnical analysis.\n\n\u2022 Discipline Engineers\u2014These are the engineers who\nactually perform the technical analysis that is the basis of\nthe advanced concepts study. Disciplines often repre-\nsented in studies include power, avionics, thermal, con-\nfiguration and layout, structures, mass properties,\ntrajectory analysis, operations, propulsion and attitude\ncontrol, human factors (optional and unique to human\nspace flight concepts), cost, and risk.\n\n24.2 The Advanced Concepts Process\n\nThe Mdot process used by the NASA Marshall Space Flight\nCenter\u2019s Advanced Concepts Office for performing an\nadvanced concept analysis of a potential future space mis-\nsion or system is shown in Fig. 24.1. \u2018Mdot\u2019 is derived from\nthe rocket equation\u2014the mass flow rate.\n\nThe process usually begins with a thorough definition of\nthe study\u2019s ground rules and assumptions (GR&A). It is in\nthis phase that the customer describes the concept to be\nassessed or used as the basis for a mission concept defini-\ntion. A cautionary note is in order: Many customers have\npreconceived ideas regarding how their technology might or\nmight not be fielded and how it should or should not be\nimplemented. Unless there is great care in the definition of\nthe GR&A, these notions\u2014which are really nothing more\nthan notional engineering design solutions\u2014might get listed\nas either a ground rule or an assumption. This must be\navoided. It is up to the advanced concept study team to\naddress these issues and to back them up with detailed\nengineering analysis. Poor GR&A can ruin a concept study.\n\nThe next step is usually a first cut mission analysis, or\ntrajectory identification, based on gross payload mass and\ncustomer-provided destination requirements. This is done to\nbound the problem and to make sure that it is even possible\nfor the spacecraft under consideration to meet a customer\u2019s\n\nFig. 24.1 The advanced\nconcepts process used by the\nNASA Marshall Space Flight\nCenter\n\n678 L. Johnson and J. Mulqueen\n\n\n\nrequirements. From this will flow general propulsion and\nattitude control system requirements in the form of an\noverall required velocity increment (DV). For Earth orbital\nmissions, it is here that overall end-of-life deorbit propul-\nsion requirements, if any, will be identified.\n\nThe propulsion system is sized to perform all of the\norbital maneuvers required during the mission. These\nmaneuvers may include initial orbit insertion, orbit altitude\nchanges, orbit plane changes, orbit altitude maintenance. In\nmany cases the propulsion system will consist of a main\npropulsion system (MPS) to perform orbital maneuvers and\nan auxiliary reaction control system (RCS) to provide\nspacecraft attitude control. The design of the propulsion\nsystem depends on many parameters in addition to the\nmission DV budget. The spacecraft mass usually drives the\npropulsion system thrust requirements, and either the mis-\nsion duration or the number of maneuvers usually drives the\npropellant selection.\n\nThe avionics subsystem analysis includes the sizing of\nthe data storage system, communications system, and con-\ntrol system. The avionics subsystem design is usually driven\nby the data quantity that is to be transmitted, the spacecraft\ndistance from Earth, the required communications network,\nand the pointing and slew rate requirements for the space-\ncraft concept. One of the driving factors in sizing a space-\ncraft\u2019s power system is communications. If a mission is to\noperate far from Earth, or requires very large data rates,\nthen this could be a significant design driver for the\nspacecraft\u2019s power system. It may also dictate pointing\nrequirements, especially for missions deep in the outer solar\nsystem that require large communications antennas on the\nspacecraft.\n\nThe power system design is based on the electrical power\nrequirements of the spacecraft subsystems, including the\navionics, propulsion system controllers, and the heaters that\nare required in order to maintain proper temperatures for\nspacecraft systems. For human missions, power must also\nbe supplied to life support systems. Electrical power is\nusually produced by solar arrays attached to the spacecraft.\nThe amount of power generated is dependent on the size of\nthe solar arrays and the angle between the Sun and the solar\narray, which usually depends on the orbital plane of the\nspacecraft. The power system design is often complicated\nby the fact that a spacecraft in low Earth orbit will spend\nconsiderable time in the shadow of the Earth. The power\nsystem must therefore be sized to produce more than\nenough power during the sunlit portions of the orbit and\nsend the excess power to an electrical storage system\ncapable of delivering power when the spacecraft is deprived\nsolar power.\n\nThe thermal control subsystem design is based on a\ncomprehensive analysis of the thermal balance of the\nenvironment; i.e. the heat generated by spacecraft systems\n\nand the temperature requirements of the spacecraft. The\nspacecraft must be shielded from the radiated heat of the\nSun and insulated from the extreme cold in shadows. The\nheat generated by the spacecraft electrical system must also\nbe dissipated in order to maintain proper operation tem-\nperatures. The thermal control system usually consists of\nthermal insulation covering the external surfaces of the\nspacecraft, electrical heaters to maintain equipment tem-\nperatures, and thermal radiators to prevent excess heat\nbuild-up.\n\nThe spacecraft structural design is based on the config-\nuration requirements of the spacecraft and analysis of the\nstructural loads placed on the spacecraft. The configuration\nis dependent on many factors, such as placement of scien-\ntific sensors, placement of solar arrays, propulsion system\nsize, and in the case of human missions, and the crew\nsystem layout. In many cases, the most significant config-\nuration driver is the packaging of the spacecraft in the\nlaunch vehicle payload shroud. The structural loads are\nusually greatest during the launch and ascent to orbit. The\nspacecraft structures must have sufficient strength and\nstiffness to withstand the acceleration loads and vibrations\nduring launch.\n\n24.3 \u2018\u2018I Have an Idea!\u2019\u2019\n\nThe first essential step for assessing a new concept is to\nanswer the question: What is the need? Many technologists\nare so enamored with their innovation that they fail to\nunderstand that no one will support it if it doesn\u2019t meet\nsomeone\u2019s needs. It is best to discuss or describe the\ninnovation by its functionality and mission-level impact\ntaking into account as many anticipated system-level\nimpacts as possible\u2014as identified in a thorough advanced\nconcepts analysis. For example, a new technology for pro-\nducing abundant power in deep space seems like the kind of\ninnovation that would be of interest to anyone considering\nmissions into deep space. However, for many robotic sci-\nence missions it is not necessarily advantageous to have\nmore power since there may not be any science instruments\nwith such a requirement. If an entirely new paradigm,\ninfrastructure, and instrument technology base is required to\nuse the new power source then it may not be cost effective\nto implement, even if a potential customer were to fully\nappreciate how it might benefit their research.\n\nIn the case of a new power system that significantly\nincreases the power availability in deep space, an advanced\nconcepts analysis would also have to be performed to\nfully understand the system level impact of the new tech-\nnology on the rest of the spacecraft. Some questions to be\nasked include\n\u2022 How will the spacecraft get rid of the extra heat load?\n\n24 Advanced Concepts 679\n\n\n\n\u2013 Typically, more radiators will be required, increasing\nboth the weight and cost of the spacecraft, not to\nmention its increased complexity.\n\n\u2022 Will any spacecraft and payload science instruments\nconsider the new power source as a new source of\nbackground noise?\n\u2013 Science instruments can be sensitive to background\n\nelectromagnetic (EM) radiation, in which case they\nmay be adversely effected by the additional EM radi-\nation from the new, high power system.\n\n\u2022 Are there safety issues with launching the new power\nsource?\n\u2013 Any sufficiently compact, high-density power source\n\nthat is miniaturized to fit within a spacecraft is only a\nsmall step away from being an explosive with clearly\nassociated mission risks.\n\n24.4 \u2018\u2018How Do I Get It Selected for Flight?\u2019\u2019\n\nThere are many good ideas out there for space missions,\nwhether they are in space science, exploration, or advanced\ntechnology development. Unfortunately, there is always\nlimited funding. The shortage of money therefore drives the\nbureaucratic system of most governments into having a\nstandard processes by which missions and technologies are\nselected for flight. Learning these processes is vital to the\nadvanced concept advocate.\n\nMost people think that winning a flight happens as the\nresult of writing a good proposal once a government\nsolicitation is released. While this is strictly true, it does not\ntell the whole story. In fact, while a good proposal is nec-\nessary to win, it is, by itself, woefully insufficient. Most\nproposals are actually \u2018sold\u2019 before the formal proposal is\never written. To be successful, the advocates should con-\nsider a variation to this plan of action before the date of a\nsolicitation is even announced\n\n1. Make your idea widely known by presenting it at\ntechnical conferences and in journals.\n\n2. Attend the discipline-specific meetings that are held by\nthe potential customers and advocates, presenting your\nidea, even if the conference\u2019s topic is not something\ndirectly related to your primary interests. An example\nmight be a small spacecraft manufacturer who has\nconducted an internal study of using a new attitude\ncontrol algorithm for their spacecraft bus attending a\ngathering of solar physicists because the manufacturer\nknows that such a pointing stability will be of signifi-\ncance in future solar physic science missions.\n\n3. Find out who the deciding official will be for an\nexpected procurement, and go visit with them, dis-\ncussing your great new idea, before the procurement is\n\never released. Your goal is to influence the procurement\nso that your idea is absolutely within its scope.\n\n4. Find other potential users, even those who may not\nhave any money to fund it at this time, and get letters of\ninterest or support for use in upcoming competitive\nsolicitations.\n\n5. Repeat steps 1 to 4, as necessary, until the selection and\nfunding of your idea.\n\n6. In parallel to the above, partner with industry, acade-\nmia, or even a government agency to broaden the\npolitical and technical support for your idea. Having\ninternal champions within the sponsoring organization\nsignificantly increases your odds of being selected.\n\n7. With your step 6 partners, complete a high-level mis-\nsion concept study that will allow you to have graphic\nimages or even artist depictions of your idea. A picture\nis worth a thousand words, but an engineering drawing\nis worth at least getting the technological readiness\nlevel to TRL-6 with a shot at TRL-7.\n\n8. Don\u2019t oversell. Be honest in your trade studies when it\ncomes to the pros and cons of your ideas versus the\ncompetition. Just make sure you highlight the pros and\nhave a \u2018good answer\u2019 to the cons\u2014good, in the sense that\nyou have a plan to attack whatever the problem may be.\n\n9. When the solicitation is released, don\u2019t go after it alone.\nYes, you and your organization may be the best people\nin the world to do the work, but partnering with others\nprovides enhanced advocacy and a sense of the idea\u2019s\nimportance.\n\n10. Get ready to lose; but in the loss, find out from the\nreviewers what they deemed needed improvement so\nthat you will become better prepared for the next\nopportunity.\n\n24.5 Crossing the TRL Valley of Death\n\nAs discussed in Chap. 21, the problem of insufficient tech-\nnical readiness can prevent missions from using new tech-\nnologies, thus reducing potential returns, and the subsequent\nentrapment of new technologies without sufficient flight\nvalidation to reduce their inherent risk\u2014potentially \u2018forever\u2019\npreventing the new technology or approach from being\nselected for a flight mission. Many technologies find them-\nselves at this critical juncture, known as the TRL \u2018valley of\ndeath\u2019, because they are too advanced for further ground--\nbased research and development, yet have been insufficiently\nproven to be accepted for a flagship science or exploration\nmission because they have never before been proven in space.\n\nThe \u2018valley of death\u2019 exists because of the inherent high\ncost of flying missions in space. The cost of maturing most\nspace technologies from one TRL to the next is relatively\n\n680 L. Johnson and J. Mulqueen\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_21\n\n\ninexpensive when compared to the cost of going from TRL-\n6 to 7. In fact, for many technologies the cost of going this\nlast step is far more than all the money spent to take them\nfrom TRL-1 to TRL-6 combined.\n\n24.6 Advanced Concepts Analysis\nin Technology Selection\n\nA good advanced concepts analysis should result in a\nspacecraft or vehicle concept that will eventually be proven\nto have been within 30 % of its eventual mass and cost.\nWhile not a detailed design, concept analysis will none-\ntheless provide a configuration, mission scenario, spacecraft\nor vehicle configuration, mass and power budgets, materials\nlist and integrated mass table (with margin), and a candidate\nlaunch vehicle capable of lofting the payload to its desired\ndestination.\n\nWithin aerospace generally, advanced concepts analysis\nis used in a wide range of areas, including the following\nexamples. Future Space Missions: Mission design includes\ndefining outcomes, designing for the mission environment,\nplanning for mission ground support, and considering fol-\nlow-on missions. As with spacecraft design, mission design\nmust consider end-to-end planning, from the initial funding\nto the system\u2019s retirement: system costs, operational needs,\nhardware and software interactions, mid-mission problem-\nsolving, and hardware disposal. Advanced concepts analysis\ndigs down to the component level of design, but also takes\nthe \u201850,000-foot\u2019 view to ensure that a human or robotic\nmission operates in the way it was intended. Space Trans-\nportation Concepts: Starting from the ground up, space\ntransportation systems must be considered from liftoff, to\nin-space operations, to atmospheric entry. When advanced\nconcepts conducts planning for space transportation sys-\ntems, all aspects of the work must be considered, from\npropellant use to propulsion system mass and performance\nto payload interfaces. This sort of preliminary planning\nensures that hardware traveling into and through space is\noptimal for its intended mission, and that it can function\nproperly when it arrives at its destination. Launch Vehicle\nConcept Design: Launch vehicles are defined to ensure that\npayloads of a specific weight reach the proper altitude\nabove the Earth. A thorough definition process will include\nreviews of current, in-work, and theoretical designs for\nspace missions to ensure that a launch vehicle design is\noptimized to meet a particular class, or classes of mission\nneeds. Using the industry standard and organization unique\nmodels (when they exist), the analysis should evaluate the\nsafety and success of the vehicles that take space missions\nfrom the ground into space. Integrated Space Systems\nAnalysis and Design: Whether it be a life support system, a\nvehicle, or a mission requiring multiple pieces of hardware\n\nand software, analysis of the interactions between multiple\nsystems and subsystems will help mission planners make\ninformed decisions about future designs. The analysis\nshould anticipate problems before they appear in the hard-\nware, thereby allowing for major incompatibilities to be\nremedied in the relatively inexpensive concept definition\nand design phase of a project.\n\n24.7 Conclusion\n\nA successful advanced concept analysis team looks like a\nminiature engineering organization in terms of skill mix,\nand like an integrated product team in terms of staffing. It\nmust be small, experienced in working at a fairly high level\n(in other words, not so detail oriented as to preclude the\nability to produce rapid turnaround engineering analyses\nwith accuracies of about a factor of two), and able to iterate\nmany different concept design options rapidly.\n\nTeam analysis must begin by gaining a thorough\nunderstanding of a mission\u2019s needs, and establish a close\nworking relationship with the customer to make sure the\nfinal concept is aligned with both their stated and unstated\nrequirements.\n\nFinally, the team must have enough project experience to\nunderstand the difference between paper-study feasibility\nand engineering capability. TRL is one of the tools that can\nbe used to make this assessment. However, there is no\nsubstitute for experience, and having a team populated with\nengineers who have worked on a successful hardware pro-\nject in the past is a definite advantage, and tends to produce\na more realistic advanced concept design.\n\n24.8 Case Study\n\nThere are numerous examples of successful advanced\nconcepts studies available in the literature. One led by the\nauthors of this chapter is provided herein.\n\n24.8.1 Integrated In-Space Transportation Plan\n\nAdvanced In-Space Propulsion (ISP) technologies will\nenable much more effective exploration of our solar system,\nand will permit mission designers to plan missions to \u2018fly\nanytime, anywhere and complete a host of science objec-\ntives at the destinations\u2019 with greater reliability and safety.\nWhen compared with state-of-the-art chemical propulsion,\nincreased capabilities include shorter trip times to outer\nplanets, higher payload mass, and enabling of missions that\nare either very difficult or impossible with chemical pro-\npulsion. Examples of these missions are orbits around the\n\n24 Advanced Concepts 681\n\n\n\nouter planets, interstellar probes, and sample return mis-\nsions from Mars or other planets. With a wide range of\npossible missions and many candidate propulsion technol-\nogies with very diverse characteristics, the question of\nwhich technologies are \u2018best\u2019 for future missions, is a dif-\nficult one. Resource limitations do not permit the develop-\nment of all candidate propulsion technologies. Therefore, it\nis required to develop a set of propulsion technologies that\nwill adequately satisfy a broad spectrum of mission\nrequirements.\n\nIn the early 2000s, NASA tasked the NASA Marshall\nSpace Flight Center to lead a national effort to identify\npromising ISP technologies, assess their ultimate capability\nto perform various future science and exploration missions,\nand recommend which should be funded for further\ndevelopment.\n\nThe effort was broken down into five parts: (1) address\nmissions, mission priorities, and mission requirements as\ndefined by the various NASA mission directorates; (2)\nprovide a forum for technologists to advocate any ISP\ntechnology for any mission(s) for which they deemed their\npropulsion technology to be appropriate; (3) perform system\nanalyses of the prioritized mission set to the degree neces-\nsary to support evaluation and prioritization of each tech-\nnology advocated by the technologists; (4) perform cost\nanalyses on each of the technologies that were determined\nby systems analyses to be viable candidates for the mission\nset; and (5) integrate all customer, technologist, systems,\ncost, and program inputs into a final prioritized set of\ntechnologies.\n\nThe primary products were a prioritized set of advanced\nISP technologies that meet customer-provided requirements\nfor the customer prioritized mission set and a set of rec-\nommendations of the relative technology payoffs in order to\nguide future NASA investment decisions. This effort\ninvolved many people at most NASA centers. The effort\nwas divided among several teams\n\u2022 The missions requirements team (MRT) defined the\n\nmissions of interest and established the requirements for\neach.\n\n\u2022 The systems team (ST) performed systems analyses to\nderive the important mission parameters for each pro-\npulsion technology for each mission. It also scored each\ntechnology for each mission against the figures of merit\nfor performance, technical characteristics, and reliability/\nsafety. The team consisted of 25 people from six NASA\ncenters and three private companies.\n\n\u2022 The Technology team (TT) proposed candidate propul-\nsion technologies to be applied to each of the missions\nand provided the important performance and technical\ncharacteristics for each of the proposed technologies.

The chapter will start with the\nrelationship between mission analysis and system design\nand the role of mission analysts in the context of the overall\ndesign process. It then continues with a section on the\napplication of concurrent engineering principles to the\ndesign of space missions. The section starts by giving some\ndefinitions and a historical perspective on the use of con-\ncurrent engineering in the space sector and then illustrates\nthe design process and the major actors and components. It\nprovides the view of the European Space Agency on the\npreliminary design of space missions. The subsequent sec-\ntion provides a different perspective, namely the design of\nlow-cost missions as seen from a private company.\n\nThe last section of this chapter presents a possible future\ndevelopment that imports into the design of space systems\nthe principles of optimization, robust design, and design for\nreliability.\n\n25.1 Mission Analysis and System Design\n\nThe term mission analysis generally refers to the area of\nanalysis devoted to the orbital design and maneuvering\naspects of a space mission. As such, a strong interaction\nexists between mission analysis and the analysis of core\nmission requirements (particularly the orbital coverage and\nenvironmental aspects). A further interaction exists with\nseveral spacecraft design aspects, including propulsion,\ncommunications, thermal, and power. These aspects are\ninfluenced by both the operational orbit and intermediate\ntransfer orbit designs.\n\nThe activities within mission analysis can be broken\ndown into a number of actions, each related to aspects of the\nmission requirements or spacecraft design. This section will\ndescribe, in compact form, the fundamental tasks involved\nin mission analysis and some of the techniques that can be\nused to implement them. Section 25.2 discusses of some of\nthe issues involved in the design of certain types of oper-\national orbits that are frequently encountered. References\nare provided from which more detailed information can be\nobtained.\n\n25.1.1 Mission Analysis Tasks\n\nAny organization procuring a satellite will have a set of\nrequirements for the mission. These relate to both the design\nof the satellite and its payload, and also the orbital design\naspects. Furthermore, there is an interaction between\nsatellite design and orbital design. Orbit aspects determine\nthe environment in which the satellite will operate, and as\nsuch influence the design of the communications, power,\nthermal and propulsion systems.\n\nMission requirements generally allow a degree of flexi-\nbility in the operational and transfer orbit design. Therefore,\nthe task of a mission analyst is to design these elements in a\nway that enables an efficient satellite design. The process is\n\nM.

These are\ndependent on a number of factors such as\n\u2013 Operational and transfer orbit environments, e.g. radi-\n\nation and atmospheric effects.\n\u2013 Operational and transfer orbit geometry and kinemat-\n\nics, e.g. ground station contact, eclipse and general\norbit illumination effects.\n\n\u2013 Operational and transfer orbit maneuver requirements,\ne.g. derivation of effects of satellite propulsion on the\nmaneuver implementation and its efficiency.\n\nIn order to complete these tasks a number of key\nmethods and techniques are frequently used. These are\ndescribed in Chap. 4.\n\nThe activities involved in mission analysis are closely\nconnected with a number of spacecraft system design tasks.\nIn some cases an iterative procedure must be adopted to\nsimultaneously evolve the mission and subsystem designs in\norder to provide an efficient, combined solution. Efficiency\nis often related to minimizing total mass. Low mass satel-\nlites and systems are generally sought, whilst meeting the\nrequirements specified by the customer.\n\n25.1.1.1 Propulsion\nOrbital maneuver requirements drive the propulsion design.\nConversely, limitations imposed on propulsion system\nperformance restrict the scope of maneuvers that may be\nperformed, with implications for orbit choice, transfer\nduration and/or fuel requirement.\n\nAs discussed in Chap. 11, the key parameters are thrust\nand specific impulse. Thrust and mass determine the extent\nof the orbital arc over which a maneuver must be performed\nin order to achieve the desired change, with implications for\nefficiency and transfer duration. Specific impulse deter-\nmines the fuel required for maneuvers. However, high\nspecific impulse often has a penalty attached, such as only\nbeing available with low thrust and making demands on\nspacecraft power. Therefore, propulsion and mission design\ncan often be an iterative process to find an efficient solution\n\nthat meets all requirements. This can in some cases be\ntreated as a constrained optimization problem, with the\nobjective to maximize the payload or minimize launch\nmass.\n\n25.1.1.2 Communications\nSpacecraft distance, elevation above the ground station\u2019s\nhorizon, and duration of the visibility pass all influence\ncommunications system design. Antenna type, amplifier\ntype, power requirements, and even coding choice (see\nChap. 14) can be linked to the mission design. Conversely,\nimposing restrictions on the type of communications units\nthat may be used can significantly influence the choice of, in\nparticular, the operational orbit. As in the case of propul-\nsion, iteration is possible between orbit and system choices.\n\n25.1.1.3 Power and Thermal Systems\nThe relationship between the orbit geometry and the Sun,\ntogether with the satellite pointing requirements to fulfill the\noverall mission needs (e.g. a nadir pointing system for Earth\nobservation) influence the design of both the power and\nthermal systems; see Chaps. 10 and 13, respectively.\n\nSolar array size and also the degrees of freedom required\nof the array steering mechanism are influenced by orbit\nchoice. Eclipse can be encountered, and this in turn influ-\nences the battery requirements. Solar illumination and\neclipse also effect the type and sizing of the thermal system\ndesign.\n\nBoth operational and transfer orbits must be considered.\nWhilst lesser pointing restrictions may exist in the transfer\nphase, eclipse periods will differ from the operational case.\n\n25.2 Operational Orbit Design\n\nAs introduced in Sect. 4.4, although many types of opera-\ntional orbit exist, certain types are prevalent; these are orbits\nclose to Earth, generally used either for observing Earth or\nfor communications, and geostationary orbits, whose pri-\nmary use is for communications and meteorological satel-\nlites. A further interesting category is orbits around the\nLagrange gravitational libration points of the Earth-Sun\nsystem for telescopes and solar observatories; further details\ncan be found in Sect. 4.4 and [1, 2]. This section describes\nsome of the aspects of designing an operational orbit.\n\n25.2.1 Low Earth Orbit\n\nMany missions in low Earth orbit (LEO) are designed to\nobserve aspects of the Earth. These could include global\n\n686 M.

Whilst many missions employ a single spacecraft,\nothers use constellations. Constellations offer the advantage\nof decreasing the mean time between repeat observations of\nspecific areas of the Earth (useful for disaster monitoring),\nor for telecommunications where global coverage is\nrequired at all times and when data relay between satellites\ncan sometimes be used. A more detailed discussion of\nconstellation design aspects can be found in [3].\n\nAs discussed in Sect. 4.4, missions in LEO are often\ndesigned to exploit certain key perturbations. This is par-\nticularly true for scientific, Earth observing missions. The\nbest-known example is to maintain a near-fixed longitude\ndifference between the Sun and the node of the satellite\u2019s\norbit. These Sun-synchronous orbits allow the preservation\nof local solar time along the ground track of the satellite\n(the locus of the subsatellite point) and thus provide repe-\ntition of satellite illumination conditions from orbit to orbit.\nThese perturbations and their effects are discussed in detail\nin Chap. 4, and for convenience are reviewed here.\n\n25.2.1.1 Perturbations Due to Earth\u2019s Gravity\nField\n\nThe Earth\u2019s mass distribution, such as that resulting from\nshape deviations from spherical and local density variations,\nresults in deviations of the gravitational force from inverse\nsquare. The primary perturbation results from the fact that\nEarth is an oblate spheroid and as such possesses a signif-\nicant J2 gravitational harmonic. This has two main secular\neffects on an orbit: a rotation of the right ascension of the\nascending node and also of the argument of pericenter\n\n_X \u00bc ? 360\np\n\n3\n4\n\nJ2\nrE\na\n\n? ?2 ffiffiffiffiffil\na3\n\nr\n1\n\n1? e2\u00f0 \u00de2\ncos i \u00f025:1\u00de\n\n_x \u00bc 180\np\n\n3\n4\n\nJ2\nrE\na\n\n? ?2 ffiffiffiffiffil\na3\n\nr\n1\n\n1? e2\u00f0 \u00de2\n5 cos2 i? 1\n? ?\n\n: \u00f025:2\u00de\n\nBoth the ascending node and the argument of pericenter\nrotate at a steady rate which is strongly dependent on the\ninclination. An inclination can be found, using Eq. 4.141,\nwhere the pericenter does not rotate: inclination = 63.4?.\nThis can be useful for specific latitude coverage in eccentric\norbits (e.g. maintaining apocenter at a high latitude). As\nindicated in Eq. 4.139, a Sun-synchronous orbit can be\nachieved by modifying the inclination to achieve an\nascending node rotation rate of 360? per year or approxi-\nmately 1?/day.\n\nThe orbital elements all show a significant, regular\nperiodic variation arising from J2. This is in addition to the\nlong term (or secular) effects already described. Therefore,\n\na distinction is made between osculating orbit elements and\nmean elements\n\u2022 Osculating\u2014the instantaneous value at any point in an\n\norbit.

Used in calcu-\nlation or orbit periods and secular effects (see Chap. 4 for\nmore details).\n\n25.2.1.2 Perturbations Due to Atmospheric Drag\nAtmospheric drag has a secular, perturbing effect on the\nspacecraft. It causes a steady reduction in orbital speed and\nhence semi-major axis. The drag force can be calculated by\n\nD \u00bc 1\n2\n\nApCDVatmosrelVatmosrel q h\u00f0 \u00de \u00f025:3\u00de\n\nwhere CD is the drag coefficient, q is the atmospheric\ndensity, Vatmosrel is the atmosphere relative velocity vector\n(i.e. the model assumes that nominally the atmosphere\nrotates with the Earth and any local wind speed effects can\nbe included), and Ap is that area normal to the atmosphere\nrelative velocity vector. Note that this equation is the same\nas Eq. 4.105, but is in a slightly different format. As dis-\ncussed in Sect. 4.3.3, CD typically takes a value in the range\n2\u20132.5, although in certain situations higher values can be\nfound. If drag is approximated as a constant force over the\norbit then the change in semi-major axis, Da, per orbit\nperiod, s, is\n\nDa\ns\n\u00bc 2\n\nffiffiffiffiffi\na3\n\nl\n\ns\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n1? e2\u00f0 \u00de\n\np D\nm\n\n\u00f025:4\u00de\n\nwhere eccentricity e is assumed to be ?1.\n\n25.2.1.3 Mission Design in LEO\nMissions in LEO are generally required to be Sun-syn-\nchronous, that is, the local solar time at the satellite equator\ncrossing remains constant. The ascending node therefore\nrotates at approximately 1?/day. This can be achieved freely\nby exploiting the J2 perturbation and choosing an inclina-\ntion that yields the required nodal drift rate; see Eq. 4.139.\nThe value is dependent on the semi-major axis of the orbit\nand ranges from typically 97? for altitudes at 400 km to 98?\nfor altitudes at 800 km; see Fig. 4.13.\n\nThe orbit is generally required to be circular or near\ncircular. In fact, so-called frozen orbits are often used to\nmaintain an altitude profile that repeats with latitude (on\nboth the ascending and descending node tracks). This can of\ncourse be achieved by a purely circular orbit but the pres-\nence of the J2 perturbation means that the altitude will\nalways vary throughout the course of the orbit, even if the\neccentricity is instantaneously zero at some part of the orbit.\n\n25 Mission and System Design 687\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nThe argument of pericenter is affected by J2, as described\npreviously and also by the J3 harmonic. However, it is\npossible to find an argument of pericenter and eccentricity\nthat results in the frozen orbit condition. The mean argu-\nment of pericenter can be set to 90? and a mean eccentricity\ncan then be found that results in no drift in the argument of\npericenter (if predictions from only J2 and J3 effects are\nconsidered, see [4]).\n\nIn practice, other gravitational perturbations cause the\nargument of pericenter to exhibit a small periodic drift. The\nvalue for mean eccentricity required for the frozen condi-\ntion is small, close to 0.0013.\n\nLEO missions are often designed to have repeating\nground tracks (subsatellite point on the Earth\u2019s surface).\nThat is, after \u2018N\u2019 days the ground track overflies the initial\nground track. This is achieved by selecting an appropriate\norbit altitude, and therefore an orbit period. The longitude\nchange in the ascending node at each successive equator\ncrossing is determined by the orbit period (80\u201390 min for\nLEO) and the speed of the Earth\u2019s rotation. Values are\ntypically 22\u201325?. It is important to note that longitude here\nis measured relative to the Greenwich (reference) meridian\nfixed on the rotating Earth.\n\nFor repetition to be achieved: (M 9 change in longitude\nper orbit) = (N 9 360?). N is the number of days in the\nrepeat period, the Earth rotating by 360? beneath the\nsatellite in one day. Of course, M is an integer. Multiple\naltitude solutions generally exist for a given N.\n\n\u2022 For N = 2, an altitude of 570 km gives a change in\nlongitude of 24? and the ground track repeats after 30\norbits or 2 days.\n\n\u2022 For N = 2, an altitude of 727 km gives a change in\nlongitude of 24.27? and the ground track repeats after 29\norbits or 2 days.\n\n\u2022 Further solutions exist for 28, 27, 26, etc. orbits.\nHere altitude is the value of the mean semi-major axis\n\nminus Earth\u2019s equatorial radius (6,378 km). An example of\na ground track repeating over 2 days is shown in Fig. 25.1.\n\n25.2.1.4 Maintaining Low Earth Orbits\nThe previous section describing perturbations in LEO\nshowed that atmospheric drag can slowly degrade an orbit,\ncausing a steady reduction in altitude. This can be prevented\nby the application of regular, prograde orbit maintenance\nmaneuvers. Typical intervals between such maneuvers can\nvary between a few days to several months. The interval is\ndriven by the altitude (and hence the atmospheric density),\nand by the requirement to limit the change in altitude\nbetween maneuvers. Large changes cause a drift in the\nground track relative to the reference case derived from an\norbit that is unperturbed by drag, as the orbit progressively\nreduces in altitude. This means that overflight of the same\nlatitude/longitude no longer occurs. A typical tolerance in\nthe longitudinal drift in the ground track is 25 km.\n\nThe change of velocity, DV , requirement to maintain\naltitude depends on two main factors: altitude (and hence\natmospheric density) and the area/mass of the satellite. Here\n\nFig. 25.1 Ground track for\n727 km altitude circular orbit\nwith a 2 day repeat period\n\n688 M. Vasile et al.\n\n\n\narea is that projected into the direction of the velocity rel-\native to the atmosphere and hence susceptible to drag. The\nDV per year can range between typically 100 m/s at lower\naltitudes (circa 350\u2013400 km) down to less than 10 m/s\n(circa 800 km). The Sun\u2019s radiation in a specific wave-\nlength range (around 10.7 cm) effects the Earth\u2019s atmo-\nsphere, and specifically the mean density with respect to\naltitude. The intensity of this emission varies over the Sun\u2019s\neleven year cycle. The DV requirements for a specific\nmission depend strongly on the phase of the Sun\u2019s eleven\nyear cycle relative to the mission start date.\n\nA further orbit control maneuver can be needed to prevent\nthe node of the orbit from drifting away from the value\nrequired to achieve Sun-synchronicity. Such a drift would\nresult in a change in local solar time at the node. Often this is\nrequired to be controlled to within several minutes. The\ncause of this drift is a small change in inclination from the\nintended value, primarily as a result of lunar-solar gravity\nperturbations. A small out-of-plane maneuver can be\napplied. The maneuver frequency depends on the tolerance\nto drift in the local solar time, but typical values may be 1\nmaneuver per year, with a DV of 5 m/s. Discussions on orbit\nmaintenance strategies for LEO missions can be found in [5].\n\n25.2.2 Geostationary Satellites\n\nAs defined in Sect. 4.4.3, a geostationary Earth orbit (GEO)\nis one where the spacecraft appears fixed over a point on the\nequator, allowing continuous communications/observation\nas required. This is because the satellite travels around the\nEarth with the same orbital period as the Earth takes to spin\non its axis.\n\nA further, related category is the geosynchronous orbit.\nThere are orbits with geostationary period but non-zero\ninclination. The resulting latitude/longitude motion of the\nsubsatellite point depicts a lemniscate curve as shown in\nFig. 4.9. This type of orbit can offer the possibility of\nextended range of latitude viewing.\n\n25.2.2.1 Reaching Geostationary Orbit\nTransfer to Geostationary orbit is generally achieved by use\nof intermediate orbits with maneuvers provided by the\nsatellite, although some launch vehicles have the capability\nto directly inject into geostationary orbit. The most common\nstrategy is however for the launch vehicle to inject the\nsatellite into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), whose\napocenter lies at geostationary altitude (35,786 km) and\npericenter at typically 200\u2013500 km. The satellite must then\nperform one or more pericenter raising maneuvers (similar\n\nto the second half of the Hohmann transfer between circular\norbits; see Chap. 4 for further details).\n\nIn some cases the launcher injection orbit does not have\nequatorial (i.e. zero) inclination but it is possible to combine\nthe pericenter raising maneuvers with plane changing\nmaneuvers if the argument of pericenter of the injection\norbit is close to 180?. This means that the DV penalty for the\nplane change is relatively small compared to the DV needed\nfor pericenter raising (which is typically 1,450 m/s).\n\n25.2.2.2 Maintaining Geostationary Orbits\nOnce on its station (i.e. the target longitude), a geostation-\nary satellite experiences perturbations: An east\u2013west drift is\nexperienced arising from the Earth\u2019s J22 harmonic (triaxi-\nality). In addition, a north\u2013south drift arises due to lunar/\nsolar gravity effects. See Chap. 4 for more details on orbit\nperturbations.\n\nThe objective is generally to keep the satellite in a\ncontrolled \u2018box\u2019 of typically 0.1? in both latitude and lon-\ngitude. Regular maneuvers are required to ensure that this is\nachieved. Typically, east\u2013west stationkeeping maneuvers\nare performed at approximately fortnightly intervals, with\nnorth\u2013south maneuvers being required less frequently.\nSome satellites are not required to maintain a north\u2013south\ncontrol and their inclination vector (i.e. inclination and right\nascension of ascending node) drifts in a predetermined way\nover the course of the mission. Discussions on orbit main-\ntenance strategies for GEO missions can be found in [5].\n\n25.2.3 Interplanetary Missions\n\nInterplanetary missions are very varied in their require-\nments. A typical format is the placing of a probe into an\nobservation orbit around a planet or one of its moons. In\nsome cases a probe is landed on the planet\u2019s surface.\nHowever, achieving the transfer between Earth and the\nplanet in question is a key aspect of the mission design and\noften drives many aspects of the overall spacecraft design.\n\n25.2.3.1 Basic Transfer Design\nThe simplest transfer between planets can be achieved via\nthe solution of Lambert\u2019s problem, described in Sect. 4.5.\nThe basic problem is the following\n1. Leave planet A at a specified epoch (so defining the\n\ninitial position vector).\n2. Arrive at planet B at a specified epoch (defining the final\n\nposition vector).\n3. Solve Lambert\u2019s problem to determine the transfer orbit\n\nand therefore the velocities at planets A and B.\n\n25 Mission and System Design 689\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\n4. Calculate the spacecraft velocities relative to planets A\nand B and thereby derive the change in velocity needed\nto depart from planet A and to rendezvous with planet B.\nGiven a requirement for a velocity relative to a planet\n\n(on departing or arriving) an impulsive DV for the space-\ncraft maneuver may be derived. This is the DV to transfer\nfrom, for example, a defined initial bound orbit around the\nplanet to a hyperbolic orbit, whose excess hyperbolic speed\nis equal to the magnitude of the required velocity relative to\nthe planet. That is\n\nDV \u00bc\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n\n2l\nrpl1\n\u00fe V21\n\n? ?s\n?\n\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n2l\n\n1\nrpl1\n? 1\n\nrpl1 \u00fe rapl1\n? ?\n\n !vuut\n\n\u00f025:5\u00de\n\nfor a general initial elliptical orbit with apocenter, apl1,\npericenter rpl1, and excess hyperbolic speed V . The constant\nl is the planet\u2019s gravitational parameter. On leaving the\nplanet\u2019s gravitational influence the residual speed relative to\nthe planet is given by the excess hyperbolic speed. This is\napproximately equal to the magnitude of the required\nchange in heliocentric velocity needed to instigate the\ntransfer to planet B. For a further discussion see [2]. A\nsimilar maneuver is required for capture to a defined\nelliptical orbit about the target planet.\n\nThe epochs at which departure and arrival take place can\nbe optimized to minimize the total DV (i.e. for escape plus\ncapture maneuvers). For an idealized case, where the two\nplanets were in circular, coplanar orbits, the epochs would\nbe such that a Hohmann transfer can be executed.\n\n25.2.3.2 General Interplanetary Transfers\nIn many cases, more complex routes are used to transfer\nbetween planets in order to reduce the total DV required.\nThese can involve multiple gravity-assists at intermediate\nplanets, as described in Sect. 4.5.6, and deep space\nmaneuvers, in order to maximize the mass that can be\ninjected into orbit around the target planet. Detailed dis-\ncussion can be found in [2].\n\n25.3 Concurrent Design of Space Missions\n\nAny product or system comes into operation after a devel-\nopment process. This starts with the product\u2019s initial con-\nception and proceeds with design, prototyping, testing,\nmanufacturing and marketing (when required). The actual\nusage then follows and at the end of its life the product is\ndisposed of. These phases are termed the life cycle. The\ndevelopment steps may be carried out sequentially, or there\nmay be a degree of parallelism and integration.\n\nConcurrent engineering is the discipline that looks at the\ntechniques and processes that allow parallel execution of\nthe product development steps. However, the term concur-\nrent engineering is used with slightly different meanings\nwithin different engineering domains. For instance, the\nEuropean Cooperation for Space Standardisation (ECSS) in\n[6] defines it as\n\nEngineering activity taking place in the context of simultaneous\ndesign of the product, the production process and all associated\nproduct usages, in an integrated, multifunctional team, with\nexternal organizational constraints minimized.\n\nReferring to the set of activities performed for selection,\nprocurement, and management of the electrical, electronic\nand electromechanical (EEE) parts within a space project,\nthe INCOSE (International Council of System Engineering)\nGlossary of Terms [7] provides a definition with wider\nscope\n\nEngineering design practice that combines the concerns of\nmarketing, functional product and process design, production,\nfield service, recycling, and disposal into one integrated\nprocedure.\n\nIn any case, all definitions maintain the two distinctive\nprinciples of (1) simultaneous execution of tasks, and (2)\nintegration of team, tools, and processes. With this back-\nground, the concurrent engineering principles can be\napplied specifically to the design phase. Hence, the main\ncharacteristic of concurrent design is the quasi-simultaneous\nexecution of the multiple tasks associated to the different\nengineering disciplines that compose the system design\nprocess. The second characteristic is the integrated char-\nacter of the design process, i.e. the fact that the different\ndesign tools relevant to the different engineering disciplines\nare somehow linked together to form a coherent and con-\nsistent set (e.g. including same variables, units, conventions,\nmargins, etc.). Finally, concurrent design emphasizes the\ninvolvement (and integration) in the design process of\nstrictly non-technical disciplines taking into account from\nthe start such external (to the technical domain) elements as\ncost and scheduling.\n\n25.3.1 Historical Background\n\nConcurrent engineering originated in the late nineteen\neighties in the USA, as a new tool to shorten the develop-\nment time of very large defense projects. The concept\nbecame popular worldwide in aeronautics and in the auto-\nmotive industry. In Japanese carmakers for instance, con-\ncurrent engineering is presently commonplace and it is\nwidely considered as one of the main contributors to their\n\n690 M. Vasile et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_4\n\n\nsuccess [8]. Concurrent engineering, and in particular con-\ncurrent design, for space applications was pioneered in the\n1990s in the USA by NASA-JPL (Jet Propulsion Labora-\ntory) [9] and the Aerospace Corporation [4] with the\nsomewhat narrower scope of performing quickly feasibility\nassessments (i.e. pre-phase A) of space missions in order to\nidentify the criticalities and cost drivers for later design and\ndevelopment phases. In Europe, the technique has been in\nuse since 1997, at ESA/ESTEC (the European Space\nAgency Technology Centre) [10] from where it has spread\nto most large European space companies, universities and\nnational agencies.\n\nAlthough the principles have largely remained the same\nsince the beginning, each organization has tailored the\nimplementation of the methodology to its own needs and\nstructure. For instance, some companies have adopted\nconcurrent design as a tool for rapid design iterations, in\nresponse to invitations to tender. Agencies, on the contrary,\ntend to use it to make technical and economic feasibility\nassessments of space mission proposals coming, for\ninstance, from the scientific community, and to help to\ndefine detailed mission and system level requirements for\nindustrial design activities. Overall, there is a trend to apply\nconcurrent engineering beyond feasibility studies into mis-\nsion phases A and B, to enlarge the scope to different\nactivities as design reviews and to cover targets other than\nmission design, as for instance, launcher or space instru-\nment design, operations, etc. An example of successful\napplication of concurrent engineering techniques to later\nphases of a space mission is the NASA Mars Pathfinder\nmission [11].\n\nRecognizing the fostering role played by the ESA/ES-\nTEC Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) in Europe, the\nfollowing description takes the CDF as reference to explain\nthe practical implementation of concurrent engineering\ntechniques [12].\n\n25.3.2 Space Mission Design\n\nA space mission always comes in response to some\nexpressed user needs, be they scientific, commercial, or\ninstitutional. The term \u2018mission\u2019 is used to indicate the\noverall set of tasks, duties, and functions necessary to\naccomplish the given user needs. \u2018System\u2019 is defined as the\ncollection of functional elements organized together to\nperform the mission, i.e. the practical means used to per-\nform the mission tasks. Within the system, and as discussed\nin Sect. 2.1.1, the \u2018payload\u2019 is distinguished from the\n\u2018spacecraft\u2019 (also called platform or bus). The payload is the\npart within the system whose operations allows the fulfill-\nment of the mission tasks while spacecraft is here used to\nmean the collection of system parts that provide the\n\nrequired services and resources for the payload to operate.\nFinally, the formal statement of a user need is a \u2018require-\nment\u2019. Requirements use invariably the \u2018shall\u2019 verbal form.\nIt is common for the user to express also \u2018constraints\u2019.\nThese are not strictly requirements but rather are restrictions\nin the possible system design solution due to financial\nconsiderations, risk mitigation, or political inputs. For\ninstance, a common constraint in ESA space mission design\nis to limit the use of equipment subject to US procurement\nrestrictions.\n\nThe space mission design process includes a large\nnumber of steps and many engineering disciplines, each\ndependent on the others for inputs and each providing\noutputs to be used by the others. The first step always\nconsists of the definition of the mission requirements (i.e.\nwhich tasks shall be performed and how) and, as a follow-\nup, of the system requirements (i.e. which characteristics/\nperformance are needed to execute the tasks). The definition\nof requirements involves interaction with the user/customer\nin order to translate the needs into technical language usable\nin the design process. In the early times of mission design,\nrequirements definition is iterative, and is updated based on\nfeedback from the system definition itself. In fact, the\npurpose of the initial design iterations is mostly to define the\nfeasibility boundaries of the user\u2019s needs and to update the\nmission and system requirements accordingly.\n\nAfter a given set of mission requirements has been\ndefined, the next step is generally the definition of the\nmission sequence to fulfill these requirements, from launch\nto operational orbit and ultimately spacecraft disposal. This\nis centered on the mission analysis discipline, which\nestablishes all the orbital parameters and required maneu-\nvers. Orbit(s) definition is the fundamental input in all the\nsubsequent system analyses including\n\u2022 Definition of mission environment (thermal, radiation,\n\nsolar illumination, etc.).\n\u2022 Definition of the reference launch vehicle.\n\u2022 Definition of spacecraft\u2019s nominal attitude(s).\n\u2022 Definition of communications architecture (ground sta-\n\ntion selection, frequency plan, etc.).\n\u2022 Definition of the systems modes of operation, for instance\n\nnominal mode with instruments operational, safe mode in\ncase of contingency, eclipse mode in case of low power\navailability, etc.\nThe above tasks are normally carried out as a set of\n\nsystem-level trade-offs, where multiple options are com-\npared based on parameters such as spacecraft mass, mission\ncost and risk, overall performance, etc. Once the main sys-\ntem-level parameters are available, the first iteration on the\nspacecraft design at subsystem level can start. This involves\nthe execution in a predefined sequence of analyses involving\nthe typical satellite design disciplines, as for instance,\n\n25 Mission and System Design 691\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_2\n\n\nattitude and orbit control, structures, thermal control, power\nsystem, avionics, ground operations, and so on.\n\nDuring the first iteration, the design team defines the\nspacecraft\u2019s configuration (i.e. general shape and which\nequipment goes where) and initializes the system budget\n(mass, power, data, etc.). The first iteration generally results\nin the identification of several design issues with some\nmission and system requirements still in violation. Further\ndesign iterations address these issues and enter into more\ndetail those areas that are considered critical or immature. If\nthe process is managed properly, each iteration reduces the\ndesign issues and leads to a closer compliance with the\nrequirements.\n\nTo assess convergence, the design team uses a few\nbenchmark parameters; for instance, compliance to the\nrequirements, total spacecraft mass in comparison to\nlauncher performance, and the projected overall cost. If this\nset of parameters is deemed to have acceptable values, the\ndesign is declared completed. If convergence cannot be\nachieved, the initial mission and system requirements need\nto be renegotiated and some descoping is often agreed upon.\n\nThe process described above implies some degree of\ndefinition of the payload. Payload design is a discipline on\nits own, which normally progresses in parallel to the mis-\nsion design and was introduced in Chap. 6. A different team\ntraditionally carries it out, as it requires different expertise\nfrom that employed for mission and spacecraft design. In\nthis latter case, the interfaces between payload and space-\ncraft need to be defined. Those include a list of resources\nthat the spacecraft is required to provide to the payload and\na list of electrical, mechanical, and thermal characteristics\nto be maintained at the physical boundary between the\npayload and the spacecraft. These lists are controlled and, if\nnecessary, updated after each iteration of the two parallel\ndesigns.\n\n25.3.3 Concurrent Design\n\nIn the traditional mission design process, a design flow (i.e.\nwhich design task needs to be executed when) would be\ndefined up-front by system engineering, who then request\nand control its execution in a sequential way by the different\ndiscipline specialists. These latter would generally work on\ntheir own and have knowledge only of the system design\nfeatures of relevance to their work. The correct exchange of\nupdated and consistent information between disciplines\nwould rely solely on system engineering. In addition, the\ndifferent discipline design tools are generally independent\nof each other, and outputs from one tool often need to be\n\u2018translated\u2019 before they can be used as inputs by another\ntool.\n\nAs mentioned, space mission design is by nature itera-\ntive; therefore this design sequence needs to be executed\nseveral times and convergence is often slow and\npainstaking.\n\nConcurrent design replaces the sequential design with a\nsimultaneous, i.e. parallel, process and requires all the\ndesign activities to be performed by a team that is physi-\ncally or virtually co-located. Design takes place by all\nparties at the same location, at the same time. This has the\nfollowing main advantages\n\u2022 The role of information conveyor of the system engineer\n\nis marginalized by allowing the specialists to have direct\ninteraction with each other and be aware of each other\u2019s\ndesign in real time. The system engineer can then con-\ncentrate on the nobler tasks of technical coordination and\nsolution of system-level issues.\n\n\u2022 Direct and immediate clarifications of design issues.\n\u2022 Natural adoption of common approaches and rules among\n\ndisciplines.\n\u2022 More involvement and awareness of system level issues\n\nby the discipline specialists stimulating more creative\nsolutions.\n\n\u2022 Use of model-based system engineering techniques.\nThe tangible results of application of concurrent design\n\nare more rapid convergence and higher consistency, with a\nconsequent reduction in the overall cost of the design\nprocess.\n\n25.3.4 Implementation\n\nAlthough the principles of simultaneity and integration\ntypical of concurrent design are straightforward, their\napplication is not, as it requires the availability and correct\nuse of at least three main resources\n\u2022 A system model.\n\u2022 A multidisciplinary team working according to a well-\n\nspecified set of rules and trained in the use of the model\n(management process).\n\n\u2022 A formal process to carry out the activities (design\nprocess).\nThe design process is model based, meaning that the\n\nsystem model is used constantly as a reference for the\nupdated description of the status of the design.\n\n25.3.4.1 System Model\nThe system model is composed of three main elements\n\u2022 An engineering database.\n\u2022 A set of design tools.\n\u2022 A software interface to allow access to the database from\n\nthe different design tools.\nThe engineering database is a mathematical representa-\n\ntion of the mission/system to be designed, in the form of\n\n692 M. Vasile et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_6\n\n\nscalars, vectors and matrixes representing all the different\nvariables that characterize the mission/system. These vari-\nables include for instance\n\u2022 The physical characteristics of system elements (units and\n\nassociated masses, power consumptions, dimensions, etc.).\n\u2022 Mission environment parameters such as orbital param-\n\neters, thermal and mechanical loads, radiation fluxes, etc.\n\u2022 System global characteristics (total mass at launch,\n\nspacecraft dimensions, etc.).\n\u2022 Requirements.\n\u2022 Performance of the system.\n\u2022 Any other information which is needed to assess cost or\n\nschedule as for instance the technology maturity level of\nthe components of the system.\nThe variables shall be standardized in terms of defini-\n\ntions, names, units, reference coordinates, etc. The database\nprovides the sharing of the data required for implementation\nof concurrent engineering principles. In addition, as it\nprovides a real-time picture of the system, it is used as a tool\nto control the status of the design and to drive subsequent\niterations. Further advantages are\n\u2022 Possibility of extracting quickly system characteristics\n\n(budgets, configuration parameters, etc.).\n\u2022 Possibility of performing parametric and what-if\n\nanalyses.\n\u2022 Possibility to create system performance simulations.\n\u2022 Understanding the relationships between performance\n\nand requirements/constraints.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that the database provides\n\nthe possibility to store (and to document, if the proper\ninterfaces are added) the final results of the design activities\nin a coherent and uniform manner. This can be used in later\ndesign phases or as initialization for further mission studies.\n\nThe design tools may be in-house models or commercial\nsoftware, and are used to size the different subsystems. Each\norganization has different preferences for its sizing tools, so\nthe model must be flexible enough to allow different\n\nsoftware modules to be included. An important feature of the\ndesign tools is that they must allow for on-line design. Ide-\nally, they should include different levels of complexity and\nmodel sophistication and rapidly provide first order results in\norder to permit the other disciplines to move in parallel.\n\nAs an example of a system model, the ESTEC CDF IDM\n(Integrated Design Model) is presented in Fig. 25.2. The\ndatabase is represented by the light green and blue boxes\n(here called Data Exchange and Data Parking) in the mid-\ndle, while the design tools for each discipline are shown all\naround; the design tools are represented by workbooks\ncomposed of a series of worksheets. The latter in turn may\nbe connected to domain specific tools and other databases\n(e.g. commercial software for structural or thermal sizing,\nCAD tools, equipment supplier database, etc.).\n\nWithin each workbook, there is an area reserved for\ninputs and one reserved for outputs. Both areas are con-\nnected to the central database (green and purple lines).\nDuring the design, the team either retrieves required inputs\nor provides variables according to the responsibilities\nassigned to each specialist. In order to do so, a software\ninterface between the design tools and the database needs to\nbe implemented. This must include a mechanism for control\nof the data flow from and to the database in order to avoid\ncontinuous updates from the different disciplines that would\nresult in uncontrolled design iterations. The process is\ntherefore not automatic; to the contrary, human interaction\nand control is fundamental to ensure smooth progress.\n\n25.3.4.2 Management Process\nUse of the system model for design activities requires a\nwell-defined process, namely a set of management and\ntechnical rules that must be followed by the team during the\ndifferent design steps. Management rules concerns mostly\n\u2022 The organization and the role of each component of the\n\nteam, including decision-making rules (which are dis-\ncussed below).\n\nFig. 25.2 Example of a system\nmodel: the ESTEC CDF\nintegrated design model\n\n25 Mission and System Design 693\n\n\n\n\u2022 The logistics.\n\u2022 The standardization of the output of the design activity,\n\neither in the form of data or documentation (reports,\npresentations, etc.).To exploit concurrent engineering\npractices, the design activity is normally organized in\ndesign sessions, e.g. plenary meetings with all team\nparticipants where the design occurs on-line and the\ndesign issues are discussed and analyzed. Off-line design\nshould be allowed only when the level of complexity of\nthe sizing activity requires simulation runs that cannot be\ncompleted within a session. This is to avoid updates of\nthe database that are not understood/shared by the rest of\nthe team. An example of a design session is shown in\nFig. 25.3. The figure also shows a typical layout of a\nconcurrent design room with a series of workstation all\nlinked together and where the specialists sit; the team\nleader who directs the flow of information and controls\nthe sequence of activities to be carried during a session\ntakes center stage. Display screens facilitate conveying\nmessages or explaining technical issues. Room(s) for\nsplinter meeting(s) among reduced groups are normally\nalso available.\n\n25.3.4.3 Design Process\nFrom the technical viewpoint the fundamental issue is to\ncontrol the design iterations in order to allow smooth design\nsteps and fast convergence. As already mentioned, space\nmission design is highly iterative, requiring several system-\nlevel loops with many lower level loops nested inside. All\nthese loops can be efficiently controlled by defining a set of\nrules for accessing the engineering database. Each succes-\nsive version of the database is the result of a given prede-\nfined set of design activities and would constitute an\niteration. At the end of each iteration, the team inspects and\nanalyzes the content of the database and extracts system-\nlevel information such as total mass, cost, risks, perfor-\nmance, compliance to requirements in order to identify\ndesign issues and target the following iteration.\n\nAnother important element of the concurrent design\nprocess is the way technical trade-offs are handled. In\nconcurrent engineering, the trade-offs and the associated\noptions and criteria are defined by the team all together.\nHence, decisions are shared and transparent, and the justi-\nfication for design choices are more transparent. In addition,\ndue to the model-based approach trade-off outcomes are\nwell documented and archived for easy retrieval at later\nstages of the project.\n\nConcurrent design has proven very effective also in the\ndefinition and management of the margins. In space mission\ndesign, margins at different levels are applied to take into\naccount uncertainties such as an ill-defined environment\n(thermal, mechanical, radiation, etc.); the poor fidelity of\nanalytical models, unforeseen factors, simplifications, etc.;\nat the equipment level coping with technology immaturity\n(i.e. if a unit is not qualified yet, there is an uncertainty on\nits actual performance); and at the system level coping with\nuncertainty in the requirements, in the definition of the\npayload interfaces, and in the launcher performance.\n\nAll these different margins get applied one on top of the\nother, and if not properly and consistently controlled they\ncan make the design overly conservative or unreliably\noptimistic. Concurrent design, due to its integrated and\nmodel-based nature, allows for a better and more consistent\ndefinition and control of the margins.\n\n25.3.5 The Team\n\nConcurrent engineering emphasizes the role of a team,\nwhich assumes a more central role and responsibility\ncompared to the traditional design approach. A few points\nare specific to concurrent engineering and will be discussed\nbelow. First, the concept on design on-line allows the direct\nparticipation of the customer/user to the design activities.\nThis greatly accelerates decision-making, permits direct\nclarification of the requirements and immediate redirection\nin the event of misunderstandings. In addition, all technical\n\nFig. 25.3 Example of a\nconcurrent design session at\nESTEC CDF\n\n694 M. Vasile et al.\n\n\n\ndecisions are transparent and shared. A second point is the\nrole of the team leader. This is a management figure distinct\nfrom the system engineer and whose function is to \u2018direct\u2019\nthe design session by making sure that all discussions and\nanalyses remain in the scope. He/she acts as a moderator\nand has the authority to take final decisions in consultation\nwith the user/customer. Thirdly, there is the inclusion in the\nteam of \u2018non-technical\u2019 (strictly speaking) disciplines such\nas cost evaluation, risk assessment, and scheduling, which\nnow have full visibility of the design process and can per-\nform on-line assessments. This is in contrast to the tradi-\ntional approach, where these evaluations take place a\nposteriori, i.e. only when the technical design is consoli-\ndated. This avoids the possibility of picking design choices\nthat are efficient technically but unacceptable from the cost,\nrisk, or schedule viewpoints.\n\nRisk is taken into account within the design process by\nperforming, in parallel to the design, a risk analysis, i.e.\nidentifying those events whose occurrence is perceived\nlikely to cause loss or degradation of the mission objectives.\nThese events can be of technical or programmatic nature.\nFor instance, the use in the design of a technology of low\nmaturity presents a risk to the project because its develop-\nment for flight may cause delays and additional costs. The\nrisks are classified on the basis of their severity (how\ndamaging their occurrence would be) as well as on the\nlikelihood of their occurrence, assessed either on statistical\ndata or on experience. The design team is then instructed to\navoid design solutions that could cause the occurrence of a\nrisk with a high severity and a high likelihood or, in case\nthis is not possible, to provide mitigation strategies; e.g. in\nthe case of an immature technology, select as an alternative\na more mature but less performing technology.\n\nFinally, specialists representing the later phases of sys-\ntem development such as verification/testing and operations\ncomplete the team. They work together with the design\nteam from the beginning, taking care to pass lessons learned\nfrom other projects, and to define the initial test plan and\noperational concept.\n\n25.4 Low Cost Mission Design\n\nOne of the limiting factors to involvement in space related\nactivities has been the high cost associated with traditional\nmissions. In the early years of space exploration, this was\nnot a particular problem as the majority of missions were\nrun by space agencies and the military, which were directly\nfunded by their associated governments. Though involve-\nment in exploitation space began to grow considerably in\nthe 1970s, the costs involved still tended to favor govern-\nments and large commercial corporations. The goal of\nopening up space to more diverse organizations could only\n\nbe achieved if lower cost alternatives were sought. The\nresult today is that numerous missions have been created to\nstimulate alternative markets, mission types, and objectives\nby providing much lower cost access to space. Indeed, the\ndesire for cost-effective missions across all areas of space\ntechnologies and mission types is even more important in\ntoday\u2019s global financial environment. Commercial organi-\nzations need robust business plans to gain funding, and even\ngovernment funded missions are seeking more cost-effec-\ntive missions when their budgets are cut.\n\n25.4.1 Low Cost Missions and the 80/20 Rule\n\nBefore considering how to design a low cost mission, it is\nimportant to categorize what a low cost mission means.\nThere are numerous applications that use space nowadays,\nand they vary dramatically in their objectives and hence\ncost. When referring to the cost of the mission, it is the total\ncost required to fund the mission from its earliest concept\ndesign right through to in-orbit operations and eventual\ndisposal. It includes all design, manufacturing, manage-\nment, testing and operational aspects of the space and\nground segments. Figure 25.4 illustrates some typical\nexamples of mission types varying from very low cost\nCubeSat missions (costing thousands of dollars), typically\nused for educational or technology demonstration purposes,\nright up to high performance space agency-run science\nmissions such as Cassini-Huygens. Crewed space missions\nare not illustrated because these are a further order of\nmagnitude (or two) more expensive.\n\nThis section focuses on the design of those missions\ntowards the lower end of the range of mission cost. That is\nto say, medium duration (\\10 years) operational missions\nprimarily for commercial or scientific purposes or even\nadvanced technology demonstration or LEO communica-\ntions. These missions are typically focused on (but not\nlimited to) microsatellite applications with a mission cost of\nseveral million up to several tens of millions of dollars for\n\nFig. 25.4 Some examples of typical space applications and estimated\ncosts\n\n25 Mission and System Design 695\n\n\n\nsingle spacecraft depending upon the mission objectives\nand spacecraft capability. The reasons for this definition of a\nlow cost mission will become apparent during this section,\nbut in summary the highest performance missions have the\nmost rigid and demanding requirements, and they offer very\nlimited opportunities to produce equivalent low cost mis-\nsions. In addition, although the lowest cost missions\n(CubeSats) are not addressed within this chapter, it is\nwidely held that in coming years technology developments\nwill mean they become as capable as current microsatel-\nlites, thereby opening up even more possibilities for ultra-\nlow cost missions. Furthermore, another distinction will be\nmade. The term \u2018low cost\u2019 itself must be defined. Within the\nmission class defined previously, a low cost mission is one\nwhich is significantly cheaper (?50 %) than a comparable\nmission developed in the traditional manner. This compar-\nison is important, because the general design process for\nboth options would look similar at a high level. Therefore,\nin order to illustrate the subtleties of a low cost mission\ndesign, a comparison will be made throughout with the\ntraditional industry approach. In the context of this section,\nthe two approaches can be briefly summarized as follows\n\u2022 Traditional space mission: A mission typically designed\n\nto be fully compliant with a series of detailed space\nengineering standards (e.g. ECSS, MIL). They typically\nfollow a very low risk design, build and manufacturing\nschedule, especially for new developments and bespoke\nmissions. These types of mission are typically built for\nspace agencies, military, governments, and large com-\nmercial operators.\n\n\u2022 A low cost mission: A mission design characterized by a\nless process driven development and by more rapid\ntimescales, with a different approach to risk management.\nThere are typically smaller spacecraft for a broad cus-\ntomer base depending upon the mission objectives.\nCustomers can include smaller commercial operators,\ndeveloping space nations for operational missions (for\nexample Earth observation), and sometimes even space\nagencies and the military (typically for educational and\ntechnology demonstration missions).\nThe distinction between the low cost and traditional\n\napproaches is important. The general set of steps used to\ndesign and construct a mission by either approach will look\nvery similar in terms of requirements analysis, design,\nmanufacture, test etc. As such, this section does not repeat\nthis procedure for low cost missions, but rather highlights\nwhere differences between the two approaches can lead to a\nreduction in the total mission cost.\n\nThe question remains: How can you design low cost\nspace missions? There is not a straightforward answer to\nthis, and indeed there is no secret formula that will always\nsignificantly reduce the cost. In reality, it is more of a design\nphilosophy, where the application of many concepts\n\ntogether can lead to a significant reduction in mission cost\nfor certain applications. Some of these concepts will be\nfamiliar to engineers, and will already be part of day-to-day\noperations of space manufacturing organizations. However,\na flexible, pragmatic approach is needed because the many\ninterrelated elements may require to be applied in subtly\ndifferent ways for diverse sets of mission objectives. Only\nwhen these many smaller things are implemented together\ncan space mission cost be dramatically reduced.\n\nThe fundamental element for the design of a low cost\nmission is the 80/20 rule. This states that for a given set of\nmission objectives, 80 % of the required performance can\nbe achieved for 20 % of the mission cost. Therefore, if there\nis some flexibility in a customer\u2019s aims there is ample\nopportunity to vastly reduce the mission cost. To fully apply\nthe rule, two important steps need to be taken: (1) identi-\nfying the type of customer and mission objectives and (2)\nchallenging the requirements.\n\n25.4.1.1 Customer and Mission Type\nThe customer and purpose of the mission is critical to\nunderstanding whether the 80/20 rule can be applied suc-\ncessfully. Take for example a space agency wishing to\ndevelop a high performance mission with many detailed\nscientific goals. Such a mission will typically have a com-\nprehensive list of rigid requirements that may have taken\nseveral years to develop. These requirements will represent\na balance between the aims and considerations of the cus-\ntomer (the space agency) and the end users (the science\ncommunity). No doubt, the end aims of the mission will\nhave been one of the key elements to ensure that it was\nselected for development in the first place. Such missions\nalso generally follow the traditional minimum-risk\napproach, requiring adherence to numerous standards that\ndefine a multitude of additional requirements for the design,\nmanufacture, and quality of the mission. All these things\ncombine to limit the scope to negotiate or \u2018challenge the\nrequirements\u2019 in an effort to apply the 80/20 rule. Therefore,\nthe low cost mission needs to focus on other opportunities\nwhere there is more flexibility in the possible design. This\ncould be, for example, through a less rigid set of mission\nobjectives or a customer who is prepared to accept alter-\nnative development approaches. This leads directly to the\nidea of \u2018challenging the requirements\u2019.\n\n25.4.1.2 Challenging the Requirements\nThe design of any mission will start from a set of mission\nrequirements or objectives of which the detail and quantity\nwill vary considerably from mission to mission. However, it\nis important to remember that these requirements are not\njust limited to the technical elements.\n\u2022 Technical specification: Defining the overall mission\n\nobjectives, the main technical parameters of the\n\n696 M. Vasile et al.\n\n\n\nspacecraft and ground segment and operational require-\nments. May also include requirements on how the system\nshould be tested, verified, etc.\n\n\u2022 Programmatic elements: Defining schedules, cost, docu-\nmentation requirements, meetings, penalty clauses and\nquality.\n\n\u2022 Other: There could be additional constraints depending\non the customer. For example, political considerations\nsuch as the location of ground stations or requirements to\nprovide training.\nIt is therefore important not only to focus on the tech-\n\nnical aspects when challenging the requirements but also on\nprogrammatic elements if a truly low cost mission is to be\ndeveloped. The process of challenging the requirements is\nsimple in theory; identify the primary mission requirements\nor objectives that are essential for the customer and those\nthat are secondary \u2018nice-to-haves\u2019. This will allow the\nmission designer to gain a good understanding of the\navailable trade-space, and will indicate the areas of the\nmission design where there may be scope to relax or realign\ncertain requirements or parameters. A detailed assessment\ncan then be undertaken to identify which requirements\nactually drive the cost of the mission design. This could be\nthrough costly bought-in equipment, extensive new devel-\nopments, or the use of a higher cost launch opportunity to\nname but a few examples. If some of these driving\nrequirements relate to areas of secondary importance, then\nnegotiations with the customer can commence on ways to\ncreate a reduction in mission cost. The result should be that\nthe customer is satisfied with the final set of agreed\nrequirements, even though they represent 80 % of the ori-\nginal performance envisaged. However, a new mission cost\nof only 20 % of the original prediction is clearly highly\nsatisfactory and may actually be the difference between the\nmission receiving funding or not. This process can be seen\nin Fig. 25.5.\n\nAs stated, challenging the requirements should not just\nbe limited to technical matters, but programmatic elements\n\nas well. Consider for example the level of formal review\npoints and associated documentation that is to be delivered\nto a customer. The more documentation that is required and\nthe more frequent the formal project reviews are, then the\nless time is available for each engineer to actually perform\ntheir day-to-day engineering activities. This will mean that\na larger team is needed in order to maintain the project\nmilestones and the cost will increase. Therefore, the ulti-\nmate goal is to find the minimum level of documentation\nwith which the customer can review the progress of the\nmission satisfactorily or operate the satellite without\nproblem.\n\nAs an example, consider a hypothetical set of require-\nments for a new Earth observation mission. It is assumed\nthat an existing spacecraft will be proposed for the mission\nand that any changes to the design will be identified. This\nexisting spacecraft design is an Earth observation platform\nthat currently operates at 690 km, giving a ground resolu-\ntion for the imager of 2.5 m. Each requirement has to be\nassessed to see if the current spacecraft is compliant. If not,\nthe impact on the mission design is assessed to determine if\nthe requirement should be challenged.\n\nThe example in Table 25.1 illustrates the process of\nchallenging the requirements for a few fictitious require-\nments. In reality, the process will require plenty of negoti-\nations with the customer. Compromises will be needed\nbetween the designer and customer to find a solution that\nthe customer will accept and which will not impose too\nmany high risk developments on the manufacturer.\n\n25.4.2 Development Approach\n\nThe low cost development approach needs to consider\nevolutionary development: (maximizing reuse of existing\nequipment and software), standards, component selection,\nand testing and qualification.\n\nFig. 25.5 Process of\nchallenging the requirements for\nlow cost mission design\n\n25 Mission and System Design 697\n\n\n\n25.4.2.1 Evolutionary Development Approach\nTo aid with the design of a truly low cost mission, another\nimportant consideration is to perform an evolutionary\ndevelopment approach. This essentially means that the new\nmission, spacecraft, or subsystem is derived from a previous\none, rather than starting with a brand new design. This\nrelates directly to the earlier discussion of the 80/20 rule,\nwhereby challenging the requirements can lead to more\ndirect heritage. Therefore, if a customer can see how\nchanges to some requirements allow more extensive heri-\ntage from a previous mission, then the overall cost and\nindeed the risk of the mission can be dramatically reduced.\nAgain, starting a mission design from an existing spacecraft\nis nothing new, but in combination with challenging the\nrequirements in order to achieve the 80/20 rule by mini-\nmizing new developments and requirements for higher\nperformance equipment it can yield large cost savings. Note\nthat this example just illustrates the process for the space-\ncraft design, but it can also be applied to the programmatic\nelements, ground segment, and/or operations.\n\nIn Fig. 25.6, it is not surprising that the lowest cost\napproach would be to produce an exact rebuild of a previous\nspacecraft. However, in reality this is very rare. There are\nusually some differences from mission to mission, which\n\nmay be caused by many things. These could include oper-\nation in a different environment, an alternative launch\nvehicle, or larger changes to requirements such as increased\ndownlink rates or improved agility. As such, the existing\nspacecraft will usually require a certain level of enhance-\nment and therefore the process of change management can\nbe used to control these modifications without dramatically\naltering the way that the overall system is designed and\noperated. It is accepted that the approach of maximizing\nequipment heritage is very low risk at the equipment or\neven the subsystem level, but the cost impact comes when\nthese individual elements are combined into a complete\nsystem. This system may not have heritage as a whole, and\ntherefore additional cost can result through a large amount\nof testing in AIT. This testing will be vital to ensure that\nthese elements can operate smoothly together. The final\nstarting point of a completely new design is another area\nthat will not typically occur. It might apply to a brand new\nstartup organization or to an educational mission, but not to\noperational missions because the risk would be too high for\nestablished organizations. What these simple examples\nillustrate is that through the application of the 80/20 rule\nand challenging the requirements, it is possible to maximize\n\nTable 25.1 Example of requirements challenging\n\nInitial requirement Impact Offer new requirement? New requirement to offer\n\nSchedule: 24 months\nto launch\n\nMedium: current predicted schedule\nof the existing spacecraft: 24 months\nto be ready to launch, provided any\nnew developments can be\nmaintained within this timescale and\na launch can be found in time\n\nYes: there is always uncertainly\nwhen a launch will occur and it is\ngenerally out-with the\nmanufacturers control\n\nSchedule: 24 months to flight\nreadiness review (this maintains the\nsame schedule for the construction\nof the spacecraft but decouples it\nfrom the actual launch date)\n\nGround sample\ndistance: 2.25 m\n\nMedium: current imager has 2.5 m\nGSD from 690 km orbit\n\nNo: the current spacecraft can\noperate at *620 km altitude which\nwill result in a GSD matching the\nrequirement so this acceptable\n\nn/a\n\nMaximum off-\npointing: \u00b135? from\nNadir\n\nLow: current spacecraft can achieve\nthis as standard\n\nNo: the proposed spacecraft is\nalready compliant\n\nn/a\n\nMaximum image\nstrip: 5,000 km\n\nHigh: current spacecraft can achieve\na maximum image length of\n2,500 km\n\nYes: to achieve this will require a\nnew design of the payload\nelectronics to allow it to operate for\nthis duration of time continuously\nwithout overheating and getting\ndegraded performance. Additional\non-board data capability storage is\nalso be required\n\nMaximum image strip: 2,500 km (If\nthe customer accepts a shorter\nmaximum imaging strip then the\ncurrent spacecraft can remain\nunmodified and therefore will result\nin a lower cost and fewer\ndevelopments)\n\nDe-orbit: at end of life\nthe spacecraft must\nensure atmospheric re-\nentry within 10 years\n\nHigh: current spacecraft does not\ncontain sufficient propellant for de-\norbit in the required timescale.\nHowever, it should be able to de-\norbit within 25 years\n\nYes: such a requirement would\nrequire an enhanced propulsion\nsystem or the inclusion of de-orbit\ndevice. The impact could be an\naccommodation issue (larger\npropellant tanks, or inclusion of a\nde-orbit device such as a tether) or\nmay require the development of a\nmore capable propulsion system\n\nDe-orbit within 25 years (without\nrelaxation of the requirement, new\ndevelopments or externally procured\nequipment may be needed. This will\nincrease mission cost and risk)\n\n698 M. Vasile et al.\n\n\n\ndirect heritage from a previous mission and therefore reduce\nrisk and cost.\n\nDeviations from this evolutionary development approach\nwill begin to occur as the mission requirements move fur-\nther away from an existing spacecraft design or mission. It\nmay be that the new mission requires a payload far in excess\nof the physical size and mass previously flown on an\nexisting spacecraft. In this case, there may be no option but\nto propose a brand new structural configuration for the\nspacecraft. However, even though mechanically the design\nmight be a new development, maximum heritage can still be\ngained from using existing avionics, software, and even\noperational concepts.\n\n25.4.2.2 Standards\nCommon standards have been developed over the years to\nachieve interoperability in order to ensure that products meet\ncertain requirements for quality, commonality, and reli-\nability. In space engineering, these standards cover all\naspects of mission management, design, manufacturing, and\noperation. They have been produced to cope with the most\ncomplex and demanding missions which could be created.\nAs a result, they contain comprehensive and rigorous\nrequirements and procedures to provide a low risk approach\nto be pursued when developing these types of missions. The\nstandards used vary globally, but two of the most widely\nused are the US Mil Standards and European ECSS.\nAlthough appropriate for the highly challenging missions for\nwhich they were designed, these standards do not necessarily\ndownscale effectively or efficiently for smaller, low cost\nmissions. Therefore, to attempt to apply such standards for\n\nless demanding mission may generate a significant amount\nunnecessary work. This could be the result of a requirement\nfor more extensive analysis and testing, which in turn results\nin higher costs and longer schedules. Even if only a subset of\nthe approximately 120 ECSS engineering standards are used\nfor an particular mission, it will take a vast effort to dem-\nonstrate compliance to the many requirements contained\nwithin each standard. A lower cost alternative is for the\nmission design team to identify the tests and procedures that\nare absolutely necessary (i.e. add value) within the scope of\nthe mission without increasing risk to an unacceptable level.\nThis can be done through the design of company specific\nprocedures, or even taking applicable parts from existing\nstandards. Indeed many lower level standards (e.g. ECSS-Q-\nST-70-08C\u2014Manual soldering of high-reliability electrical\nconnections) are perfectly applicable and are used for either\ntraditional or low cost mission design approaches as they\nrelate to the quality of the manufactured parts.\n\nThe most important thing is to have sufficient flexibility\nto be able to determine the most suitable approach that\nallows the production and operation of equipment at a\nnecessary level of quality to satisfy the mission goals. To\nunderstand how to do this in reality requires experience\nfrom the engineers within the mission team, and sufficient\nflexibility in their organization to adapt to positive changes.\nIt is therefore not something that can be learned quickly.\nHowever, the key message to convey about the use of\nstandards for low cost mission design is to think about what\nis necessary within the schedule and risk constraints of the\nmission. Question whether a particular document, test, or\nanalysis adds value or reduces risk and does not simply\n\nFig. 25.6 Development\napproaches for new missions\n\n25 Mission and System Design 699\n\n\n\nincrease mission cost. Note that using fewer standards for\nlow cost missions does not result in a lower quality; it just\nproduces a more streamlined approach.\n\n25.4.3 Component Selection\n\nAnother extremely important area to address when design-\ning a low cost mission is the choice of the type of com-\nponents used to create the spacecraft avionics. These can be\nloosely grouped into two types of electrical components\ncommonly used in space; namely space qualified or high\nreliability (as discussed in Sect. 3.4.4), and commer-\ncial-off-the-shelf (COTS).\n\nThe differences between these types of components is\nsummarized in Table 25.2.\n\nTo design a low cost mission, COTS components are\nattractive because they are significantly cheaper than their\nspace-grade equivalents. Despite not being designed to\noperate in space, they have been successfully used on many\nlow cost space missions. This provides the best possible\nproof that they can be used in such an environment. A\nsignificant advantage with using COTS components is the\nflexibility afforded by short lead times and low cost. This\nmeans that components can be rapidly changed if they are\ndamaged during testing or if a design modification requires\nan alternative part. If a comparable space-grade component\nwas used with a lead time that could well be in excess of a\nyear, then ordering a new component would not be possible\nwithout a major impact on a project schedule. It should also\nbe noted that the use of COTS components will generally\nonly result in a much lower equipment cost than using space\nqualified components provided that the mission can satisfy\nthe following constraints\n\u2022 Radiation total dose is low: COTS components will\n\ntypically survive up to 5\u201310 Krads(Si) meaning they are\nbest suited to short to medium duration LEO missions\n(\\7\u201310 years) depending on the exact orbit (though this\ndoes not exclude their use beyond LEO in certain cases).\n\n\u2022 The effects of single-event effects (SEE), as discussed in\nSect. 3.3.2, on the components are understood and will\nnot impact the desired performance of the system. For\nexample, if a single event upset (SEU) causes an equip-\nment reset, then the system will be robust enough to\nmaintain safe operation while the equipment reboots.\nTherefore, before using COTS components, the opera-\n\ntional environment should be assessed carefully and the\nimplications considered across the whole project. While the\nraw cost of the components is significantly lower for COTS\ncompared to space-grade equivalents if the qualification\napproach used requires every COTS component to be\nextensively tested (e.g. for radiation \u2018hardness\u2019), then the\noverall cost to the mission could actually be higher than\nbuying an equivalent qualified space-grade component. The\ndetailed procedure for component selection is beyond the\nscope of this chapter but to summarize, consider the fol-\nlowing criteria\n\n1. Driving requirements (cost, schedule, performance).\n2. Environmental assessment (radiation, thermal etc.).\n3. System design implications (FDIR, redundancy, duty\n\ncycle).\n4. Qualification approach (test every new component, flight\n\nheritage in comparable environment).\nA simplified view of an example selection process can be\n\nseen in Fig. 25.7.\nIn summary, COTS components can provide the greatest\n\nflexibility, highest performance (through access to most up-\nto-date-technology) and lowest cost option for a space\nmission design so long as the mission design and test\napproach is suitably selected. For long duration, high radi-\nation missions, it is probably cheaper to use space-grade\ncomponents in many cases rather than performing extensive\ntesting and qualification on COTS components.\n\n25.4.4 Testing and Qualification\n\nOnce the heritage baseline has been identified and changes\nbetween this and the new mission identified and agreed,\n\nTable 25.2 Comparison between space qualified and COTS components\n\nComponent Typical applications Notes\n\nSpace qualified or\nhigh reliability\n\nSpace missions, military\napplications\n\nPros: They are certified. E.g. by ESA, MIL-S etc. High level of traceability to wafer\nlevel, fully tested, screened, those specifically designed for space use are usually\nradiation assured. Therefore, generally ready to use when purchased\n\nCons: Built in low volumes and a high procurement cost, longer lead times, Some US\ncomponents may be ITAR controlled. The screening process can be hazardous\n\nCOTS Commercial, industrial and\nautomotive industries\n\nPros: Inherently reliable due to tight process control. No lot based qualification. Built\nin high volumes so well proven and controlled processes. Most advanced and up-to-\ndate technology available. Low cost and short lead times\n\nCons: No screening. Not full traceability to die. Far more susceptible to the space\nenvironment than other components\n\n700 M. Vasile et al.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_3\n\n\nthen careful management of these changes is needed to\nensure that the mission cost remains low. This management\nalso has to consider the testing and hence the qualification\napproach used for the spacecraft.\n\nThe conventional approach in the space industry is to\nperform rigorous low level testing in order to qualify all\nequipment and subsystems to any new requirements, before\nadvancing to high level testing of the full system. There is\nnothing wrong with this approach if a conservative\napproach to risk management is desired. It may even be\ndictated by contractual interfaces, where a subcontractor is\nrequired to \u2018prove\u2019 their equipment works before it leaves\nthe factory. However, when designing a low cost mission\nthis strategy can be addressed in a slightly different way.\nRather than qualifying all equipment through low level\ntesting, restrict this approach to just new developments, or\nequipment which has undergone substantial modification\n(of either hardware or software). This more focused testing\nis used to retire the largest risks as early as possible in the\nproject, particularly before the spacecraft enters AIT where\nlarge modifications can be far more costly. For all other\ninternally manufactured subsystems, these can be verified at\na higher level, as part of the whole system. Note that for\norganizations that have a large amount of externally pro-\ncured equipment, the suppliers will have qualified their\nunits prior to delivery to AIT. This approach is illustrated in\nFig. 25.8. Those that are heavily modified, or are new\ndevelopments will typically have an engineering model\n(EM) made. This may simply be the electronics, and testing\nis performed to ensure that the design operates as expected.\nAfter this, if it is deemed too high risk to proceed directly to\nthe equipment proto-flight model (PFM), then an engi-\nneering qualification model (EQM) can be manufactured.\nThis is basically a flight representative module, electrically\nand mechanically, which will be tested thoroughly in order\nto qualify the unit for its expected environment. Indeed, the\nunit could even be tested at system level on the structural\nqualification model (SQM) where it would experience a\n\nvery similar mechanical environment to that expected on\nthe actual spacecraft. After this point, a flight model (FM)\nof the equipment can be built to be integrated on the\nspacecraft. Alternatively, if the risk of mechanical failure\nwas not deemed high, the unit could proceed directly to a\nPFM without the need (and cost) of an EQM. This unit\nwould undergo some functional testing before integration\nonto the spacecraft. Indeed, all equipment/units undergo\nfunctional testing before being integrated into the spacecraft\nPFM. This is to ensure that it is all operating as required\nprior to integration.\n\nThe main aim of the equipment level testing is to dem-\nonstrate that none of the equipment will damage the\nspacecraft when integrated into a complete system, as well\nas to verify those requirements that cannot occur at the\nsystem level. In contrast, the system level testing is used\nlargely to verify the performance of the entire system\nincluding ground segment.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that as much of the\ntesting as possible is performed in the flight configuration.\nThis means that the spacecraft and its software can be\noperated in as realistic a manner as possible prior to launch.\nAll interfaces can be thoroughly exercised, ideally using\nactual hardware and software from the operational ground\nstation. This allows commands to be generated and data to\nbe returned from the spacecraft in exactly the same manner\nas if it were in orbit. Obviously not all equipment can be\ntested in such a representative manner (e.g. propulsion\nsystems, AOCS equipment), but a large proportion and the\nspacecraft equipment and subsystems can be verified in this\nway.\n\n25.4.5 Risk Analysis\n\nAnother significant way to reduce cost is by the manner that\nrisk is handled within the project. This means that key risks\nspecific to the mission are identified and effort is focused\n\nFig. 25.7 Example of COTS\nparts selection process for an\navionics unit\n\n25 Mission and System Design 701\n\n\n\nonly on addressing those. Effort is not spent reducing every\nimaginable risk to zero prior to launch, no matter how low\nthe probability of it actually occurring. This does not mean\nthat the mission is any less likely to fulfill its mission\nobjectives than a traditional mission. All it means is that a\nless cautious approach can be adopted with regards to things\nlike reliability, testing, qualification, etc.\n\nIt is important not to induce rising costs by excessive risk\nreduction for the type of mission. Not all risks can be\ncompletely retired during a mission, since there are so many\nunexpected events that can happen throughout the design,\nmanufacture, and operational phases. In addition, no\nspacecraft can really be 100 % reliable or offer 100 %\navailability (though some come very close). The key is to\nfind a suitable balance between an overly optimistic\napproach (high risk) and a very conservative approach\n(lowest possible risk). Examples can be found of both\nextremes producing undesirable results, ranging from tragic\nfailures of human space flight missions, built to the highest\nsafety standards and minimum risk, to failures at the other\nextreme such as exceptionally low cost student-built satel-\nlites. In addition, irrespective of the type of spacecraft, risk\nphilosophy, etc., there is still a relatively high possibility of\na launch failure. Indeed current launch systems are aver-\naging a success rate of the order of 91 %. With this in mind,\nrisk can be managed in a more pragmatic way. The general\napproach to minimize costs is to focus efforts on tackling\n\nthe major risks and developing appropriate mitigation\nstrategies. The way this is achieved will be described in\nmore detail in the following sections.\n\n25.4.6 Schedule Implications\n\nIt has already been mentioned that a low cost approach to\nrisk revolves around focusing on the most critical risks\nrather than trying to eliminate all risks. This produces a\nmore streamlined approach that makes the best use of the\navailable resources without extending project schedules. To\nminimize mission cost it is important to keep the overall\nschedule as short as possible without increasing risk beyond\nan acceptable level. This is for several reasons. Firstly,\nmany low cost missions rely on secondary launches.\nAs such the launch date is always driven by the primary\npayload on the vehicle and therefore, if the other passenger\nis not ready it may miss its launch. In addition, the longer\nthe schedule, the longer the team of engineers and managers\nwill be working on the project, increasing cost. However, if\nthe schedule is shorter than some optimal point, there may\nbe little time to allow for additional testing. The result could\nbe that late-breaking problems arise in AIT. These are\ntypically very costly to fix that late in the project and again\nwill drive up mission costs considerably. Therefore, by\ngaining an early understanding of the critical risks and\nappropriate mitigation strategies, it should be possible to\n\nFig. 25.8 Example of test flow\nand model philosophy\n\n702 M. Vasile et al.\n\n\n\ndetermine the optimal schedule for the mission. An example\nof this general profile is seen in Fig. 25.9 where the initial\ncost of the mission is shown for a variety of possible\nschedules. To find the overall lowest cost mission, the\nbalance between schedule and risk can be seen. A minimal\nschedule might lead to late breaking issues towards the end\nof manufacture and test (too many corners cut), which will\nincrease the overall actual cost. Similarly, a conservative\nschedule due to rigorous testing throughout to vastly reduce\nrisk will also be costly, but with a far lower likelihood of\nlate breaking issues. The key is to find the optimal balance\nbetween the two extremes.\n\nThe profile in Fig. 25.9 will vary considerably from\nmission to mission because there are always so many\nunpredictable events throughout the mission development,\nand even the most experienced teams pursuing the most\nconservative approach to risk management can experience\ncostly late breaking issues.\n\n25.4.7 Risk Management\n\nThe next area to address is an approach to actually man-\naging risk whereby the project will only focus on those\ndeemed most critical. The standard approach in the space\nindustry is to create a risk register; see Sect. 7.8. This\nrequires all engineers and managers on the project to\nidentify any risks that they foresee and to rate them\naccording to the likelihood of their occurrence and the\nseverity of their impact. In addition, suggested mitigation\nstrategies are needed of their impact into the revised esti-\nmates of cost and schedule. Three example risks are shown\nin Table 25.3, though in reality there could be hundreds\nidentified on any particular project; that is why it is so\n\nimportant to focus only on those deemed to be most critical\nif mission costs are to be minimized.\n\nTo focus the main effort on the critical risks requires a\n\u2018bottom-up\u2019 approach. This revolves around managing risks\nat the lowest level in the project hierarchy. Therefore, those\npeople involved with a particular work package will iden-\ntify all the perceived risks to their work. Those that are\ndeemed critical (high probability and large impact to the\nproject) will be flowed up to the project level risk register,\nto be managed by the project manager. It may even be that\nthe project manager flows a further subset of risks to a\ncorporate level to be dealt with by company directors if the\nrisk is severe enough or cannot be managed or mitigated at\nproject level. All risks are reassessed at regular review\npoints and can be retired as the mission progresses.\nOf course, as risks are retired, new ones can arise, so regular\nrisk reviews are needed in order to ensure resources on the\nproject are correctly focused on the right areas (Fig. 25.10).\n\nIt is important to stress that accepting an alternative risk\nmanagement approach in order to reduce mission cost, does\nnot mean that it is more likely to fail than a traditional\nmission. The low cost mission simply relies on focusing the\ndesign effort on the most critical areas to save time and\nresources (hence money).\n\n25.4.8 Margins and Design Flexibility\n\nConsider now some of the engineering approaches that are\nused during the design phase to manage risks that may\nappear later in the project: (1) application of suitable mar-\ngins and (2) flexibility in design.\n\n25.4.8.1 Margin Philosophy\nThe application of suitable margins for mass, power con-\nsumption, data storage etc. is of course standard engineering\npractice. These margins at the beginning of a mission design\nphase are typically as follows: new developments: 10\u201320 %,\nmodified equipment: 5\u201310 %, unmodified equipment: 5 %.\n\nHowever, the low cost mission designer should take care\nin applying margins, as the impact on the mission cost can\nbe negative in the following two scenarios\n\u2022 Overly conservative margins adopted early in the project:\n\nThis can lead to an over-design of the system for the\nmission objectives, or over-paying for a launch if the\npredicted mass of the spacecraft was high at the time of\nlaunch negotiations (e.g. retaining large mass margins).\n\n\u2022 Maintaining a standard margin when there is scope to\ndeviate from it with minimal cost implication. For\nexample, a launch is procured with a higher upper limit\nfor mass than is predicted by the spacecraft\u2019s needs. In\nsuch a case, it may be possible to make savings in cost/\nschedule by using this extra mass budget to ease\n\nFig. 25.9 Cost and risk for an arbitrary mission if different schedules\nare used\n\n25 Mission and System Design 703\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-41101-4_7\n\n\nconstraints elsewhere in the design; e.g. making module\nboxes thicker in order to reduce the total radiation dose\nexperienced by the electronic components. This could\nprevent the need to perform costly radiation testing of\nnew components and hence provide cost savings to the\nmission without adding any additional risk.\n\n25.4.8.2 Flexibility\nThe final point to consider when designing a low cost\nmission relates strongly to the amount of flexibility built\ninto the design. There are many subtle ways that flexibility\ncan provide small cost savings and reduce risk, but there is\none major element that can have a large influence on cost:\nThis is to design the spacecraft for launch on a range of\nlaunch vehicles. The typical cost for the majority of com-\nmercially available launch vehicles is approximately\n$40,000 per kg for a typical microsatellite (with a mass less\nthan a few hundred kg) purchasing a dedicated launch will\nresult in an excessively costly mission. The only way to\nreduce this cost significantly is to share a launch with one or\nmore other satellites. However, finding a launch that fits\ninto the mission schedule and requirements (e.g. the correct\norbit) is very challenging. Therefore, in order to ease this\nproblem, the spacecraft should be designed to be compatible\nwith several launch options. This will mean for example\nthat it is qualified to survive the launch environment of all\ndesired options. This is especially important considering\nthat a suitable launch opportunity may not be found until\n\nwell into the mission design or manufacture, by which time\nit will be too late to requalify the structure to a new set of\nmechanical loads.\n\n25.4.9 Reliability Analysis\n\nIn the space industry, it is very important that systems are\nreliable because (with a few notable exceptions) there is no\nopportunity to fix hardware once the spacecraft has been\nlaunched. Therefore, analysis must be undertaken on the\nground to determine exactly how reliable the system is per-\nceived to be. In this context, the term \u2018reliability\u2019 is essen-\ntially defined as the probability that the system will satisfy its\nmission objectives for the required lifetime in its operational\nenvironment. Of course, any customer may have a require-\nment that their system operates for the desired mission life-\ntime with an acceptable level of availability (freedom from\noutages) and some may expect to see reliability calculations\nto \u2018prove\u2019 the system will work in orbit. However, focusing\ntoo much effort on up-front reliability predictions can be\ncounter-productive and can increase schedules (and hence\ncost). The reason for this is that it is very difficult to produce\naccurate (and hence meaningful) reliability and availability\ncalculations for space missions. Even industry standards to\ncalculate reliability such as MIL-HDBK-217 states the fol-\nlowing: \u2018\u2018Predicted and achieved reliability have always\nbeen closer for ground electronic systems than avionic\n\nTable 25.3 Examples of some risks which may be encountered on a project\n\nExample risk Likelihood Impact Mitigation Level\n\nAn EEE component in a unit is obsolete and needs\nto be replaced with one without flight heritage.\nMay make unit more susceptible to failure\n\nHigh Low Select an alternative component with same\nfunctionality. Additional testing can be performed\nif required (e.g. radiation)\n\nWPM\n\nExternally provided payload equipment on the\ncritical path may suffer delayed delivery. This\nwould cause schedule delay and possible\npostponement of launch\n\nLow Medium Add contingency in project schedule. Look for\nways AIT activities can progress can progress\nbefore payload arrives (maximise \u2018platform\u2019 level\ntesting)\n\nProject\n\nResource conflicts within the manufacturing\ncompany may lead to another of its missions\ncompeting for engineers time, test equipment etc.\nThis could cause major delays to equipment on\nthe critical path of the mission\n\nMedium High Prioritisation between the two projects has to be\naddressed at a corporate level. Mitigation will\ninclude recruiting new engineers, or procurement\nor hire of alternative test equipment and facilities\n\nCorporate\n\nFig. 25.10 Simplified example\nof risk management during part\nof a project\n\n704 M. Vasile et al.\n\n\n\nsystems, because the environmental stresses vary less from\nsystem to system on the ground.\u2019\u2019 To take this a step further\n[3] lists examples where spacecraft have reached the point in\nthe mission where theoretical reliability calculations would\npredict failure, and yet were still operating nominally, and in\nsome cases for many additional years. Therefore, a low cost\napproach is to put less emphasis on theoretical predictions\nand more on experience gained from in-orbit heritage.\nReliability analysis can be useful but should not be used as a\ndriver to reduce mission risk or to determine whether a\nmission will achieve its design lifetime.\n\nSo it is important to understand how you actually\ndetermine the system is reliable\u2014focusing on a theoretical\nfigure which may not be fully applicable to all aspects can\njust lead to higher cost with very little benefit to the project.\nThe design of a suitably reliable system need not rely on\nexplicitly calculated figures in order to ensure that a mission\nwill still achieve all of its mission objectives. It is just as\nvalid in many cases to show that in-orbit heritage of the\nspacecraft and therefore the processes followed throughout\nthe mission design, manufacture, and operation have dem-\nonstrated a working system, operating in the actual envi-\nronment that any similar future mission will experience.\n\nIn summary, the risk management for low cost missions\nshould go through the following steps\n\u2022 Identify all risks.\n\u2022 Rank them according to likelihood and the severity of\n\ntheir impact on the mission.\n\u2022 Identify possible fixes and mitigation strategies.\n\u2022 Focus efforts on reducing those with the biggest potential\n\nimpact on the ability of the mission to satisfy its mission\nobjectives for the cost and schedule expected. This could\nbe achieved through focused early testing on engineering\nmodels, detailed analysis etc.\n\n\u2022 For all other risks ask the question: Can the mission live\nwith the impact IF the risk does occur!\n\n\u2022 If yes, or it could be fixed at a later date (e.g. in orbit via\nsoftware upload) then do not spend effort on it now\n(unless it is part of normal day-to-day work).\n\n\u2022 It is not necessary to retire all risks to zero before launch.\n\u2022 Some things could be an inconvenience or need a work\n\naround if they occur, but the mission objectives could still\nbe achieved.\n\n25.4.10 Organizational Structure\n\nAs mentioned earlier in the chapter, to achieve a truly low\ncost mission all aspects of the mission should be addressed,\nand not just technical but programmatic and even organi-\nzational elements. This section focuses on the organiza-\ntional elements that can help to achieve a truly low cost\nmission design. This area is highly dependent on the overall\n\nstructure of the manufacturing company, and hence it may\nbe difficult for established companies to adopt should they\neven wish to do so.\n\nFirstly, try to maintain a consistent project team for the\nfull mission cycle. This means that the same engineers are\ninvolved in the design, manufacturing, testing, and opera-\ntional (LEOP at least) phases of the mission. By having\nseparate teams for the design, test, and operations, there will\nneed to be a vast amount of documentation generated at\neach handover from one team to the other. When the team\nremains constant this ensures continuity of knowledge\nthroughout the project without the need for vast amounts of\ntime consuming (and hence costly) documentation.\n\nAnother programmatic area that is of great importance\nwhen designing a low cost mission is to minimize the\nnumber of contractual interfaces as far as possible. At a\nprogrammatic level, each subcontract has to be managed.\nThis will include attending external meetings (often over-\nseas) and the generation of sufficient documentation by both\nthe prime contractor (to define schedules, requirements etc.)\nand from the subcontractor (to provide design information\nand operational instructions, for example). Furthermore, the\nsubcontractor also has to make a profit on their sale, and has\nto maintain a margin to ensure that they can meet the\nspecification set out for them. All these things lead to a\nhigher cost than if a similar piece of equipment could be\nproduced internally by the prime contractor. An added\nadvantage is that the prime contractor maintains full control\nover schedule and has complete transparency over the\ndesign of internally manufactured equipment. In addition,\nthey also have full control over any risks, giving them the\nflexibility to implement a pragmatic approach in order to\nallow focus only on those risks that are deemed most critical\nto the mission.\n\nObviously, it will never be possible for a particular\nsatellite manufacturer to make every bit of equipment\ninternally because specialist suppliers are needed for vari-\nous components and equipment (for example battery sup-\nply), but a company that buys the majority of the equipment\nfrom external suppliers will find it more difficult to produce\na low cost mission.\n\n25.4.11 Mission Operations Impact\n\nSo far, the design of a low cost mission has focused pri-\nmarily on the design of the space segment as well as pro-\ngrammatic elements. However, another way that mission\ncost can be reduced involves how the spacecraft will be\noperated. What needs to be identified is some optimal low\ncost point that is defined by the level of autonomy/auto-\nmation on the spacecraft and ground segment.\n\n25 Mission and System Design 705\n\n\n\nAt one extreme, a mission that relays on limited auton-\nomy and hence a large full-time operations team will incur\nhigh labor costs. At the other extreme, the entire ground\nsegment and spacecraft is able to operate autonomously.\nThis may appear at first to be the lower cost option, but it is\ntrue only if considering the cost of the operational phase of\nthe mission. To design a mission with such a high level of\nautonomy will require a very costly test campaign on the\nground. A vast array of possible failure scenarios must be\nconsidered and tested on the ground to ensure the system\ncan recover from these scenarios. This will drive up the\ncosts and schedules of the mission vastly. Therefore, what is\ndesired is a compromise between the two extremes; auto-\nmate as many of the simple day-to-day operations as pos-\nsible, while still having operators on call to fix any\nanomalies that may occur in-orbit.\n\n25.5 Robust Design of Space Systems\n\nIn every design phase of an engineering system, component,\nor process, designers and decision makers need to consider\nthe impact of uncertainty on the budgets and performance of\ntheir design solution. A poor consideration for uncertainty\nwould lead to incorrect decisions and to an increased cost in\nlater phases. Starting from the seminal work of Taguchi in\nthe 1950s [1], many scholars have developed computational\ntechniques that aim to achieve an efficient and correct\nquantification of uncertainty. These techniques can gener-\nally be classified depending on the nature of the uncertainty\nand on the particular context. Uncertainty can be in the\ndesign, in the manufacturing, and in the operation of system,\nprocess, or component. Uncertainty quantification during\noperations generally aims at identifying failures based on\ncurrent knowledge and on probabilistic models of the\nexpected behavior of the system or process. Generally a\nbottom-up approach is used in which the risk associated with\nindividual component is connected to the risk of all the other\ncomponents and thence to the status of the system. Uncer-\ntainty quantification in manufacturing generally refers to\ntolerance in the manufacturing process and to the inherent\nuncertainty of the actual size, mass, and shape of compo-\nnents that affect their performance. Uncertainty in the design\nprocess is instead related to the current knowledge of the\ndesigners and their subjective judgment. Note that during the\ndesign phase, decision makers need to account for manu-\nfacturing and operations when they design their system.\n\nUncertainty exists in two basic forms: aleatoric or epi-\nstemic. Aleatoric uncertainty is irreducible and is due to the\nintrinsic stochastic nature of physical phenomena. It can be\nwell modeled and described with probability distributions\nand a frequency approach in which the likelihood of an\n\nevent depends on the number of occurrences. Probability\ntheory adequately covers aleatoric uncertainty and provides\nthe required mathematical tools to deal with it. Epistemic\nuncertainty is instead related to the lack of knowledge, and\nis therefore reducible. It cannot be well modeled with\nprobability distributions (although there are probability-\nbased approaches). Imprecise probability theories are pro-\nviding the required framework and tools to deal with epi-\nstemic uncertainty.\n\nFrom the distinction made above between uncertainty in\ndesign, manufacturing and operations, it can be said that in\nthe early phase of the design of a space mission uncertainty\nis mainly epistemic, during manufacturing is aleatoric, and\nduring operations a bit of both; though methods based on\nprobability theory are generally used in risk management.\n\nIn this section, the focus is on the management of epi-\nstemic uncertainty during the early design phase, and its\ninclusion in the optimization of a space engineering system.\nThe principles of robust design and design for reliability\nwill be introduced together with the associated probability-\nbased techniques. The section will then focus on the use of\nimprecise probabilities to capture epistemic uncertainty in a\nrobust design and design for reliability. The main interest is\nto provide a quantification of the design margins and opti-\nmize the design solutions under epistemic uncertainty. In\nother words, the interest is in producing optimal design\nsolutions that are robust against epistemic uncertainties on\nthe input parameters and in producing a correct quantifi-\ncation of the design margins on the system budget and\nperformance, based on current knowledge. The approaches\nin this section can represent an alternative to the use of\nECSS or equivalent standards.\n\n25.5.1 Robust Optimization and Uncertainty\nQuantification\n\nConcepts of robustness and robust design optimization have\nbeen developed independently in different scientific disci-\nplines, mainly in the fields of operations research (OR) and\nengineering design. The introduction of the concept of\nrobustness in design and manufacturing is generally attrib-\nuted to Genichi Taguchi, who first proposed a highly influ-\nential design philosophy based on the identification and\nquantification of those noise factors that affect the perfor-\nmance of a product or process [13]. However, the use of\nTaguchi\u2019s approach into an optimization process becomes\nintractable for even medium dimensional problems. The\nprogressive increase in computing power has stimulated the\ndevelopment of uncertainty quantification and robust design\noptimization methods in all fields of engineering. Since\nTaguchi\u2019s approach was proposed, many authors have\n\n706 M. Vasile et al.\n\n\n\ndevised a wide range of methods that are suitable for specific\nproblems. If epistemic uncertainties are not included, the\nuncertainty in the design parameters can be defined with\nprobabilistic functions. The effect of the uncertainty is then\npropagated through the system model to compute the mean\nand the variance of the performance index and constraints. In\nsimple cases in which the model can be treated analytically,\nthe mean and the variance are computed through first and\nsecond order expansions of the performance index and\nconstraints. In other cases, Monte-Carlo simulations are used\n[14]. In some cases, the mean and the variance are then\nminimized simultaneously with some multiobjective opti-\nmization technique [15\u201317], although in the case that only\nthe feasibility is of interest, only the variance is minimized.\nMethods for robust optimization using the expected value\nrobustness measure and taking feasibility constraints into\naccount can be found in [18]. Epistemic uncertainties have\nbeen treated with fuzzy logic [19] but also possibility theory\n[20, 21]. More recently, other approaches based on evidence\ntheory have been proposed [22, 23]. An initial effort to apply\nthe principles of robust design optimization to space mission\ndesign can be found the works of Vasile and Bonetti and\nVasile [24\u201326] where the authors applied evidence theory\nand evolutionary multiobjective optimization to the design of\na reusable vehicle, and an aerocapture spacecraft respec-\ntively. Later on, Croisard et al. [27\u201330] applied evidence\ntheory to the design of a low-thrust mission to Mercury. In\nthe same years, Fuchs and Neumaier [31] focused both on the\nmodeling of the uncertainty and on the computational tech-\nnique to generate robust design solution for multidisciplinary\nspace systems. They used multidimensional potential clouds\nto model uncertainties and several optimization techniques to\nsolve the optimization under uncertainties.\n\n25.5.2 Robust Optimization and Design\nfor Reliability\n\nThe robust design of an engineering system can be formu-\nlated in different ways depending on the object of interest.\nIn robust optimization the interest is generally to minimize\n(maximize) the expected value of one or more design\nbudget fi, with i = 1,\u2026,m, and the associated variance (or\nhigher order statistical moments), i.e.\n\nmin\nd2D^u2U\n\nl \u00bc E f1 d;u\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?; . . .;E fm d; u\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd ?f g\n\nmin\nd2D^u2U\n\nr \u00bc E f1 d; u\u00f0 \u00de ? l1\u00f0 \u00de2\nh i\n\n; . . .;E fm d;u\u00f0 \u00de ? lm\u00f0 \u00de2\nh in o\n\n\u00f025:6\u00de\n\nwhere d is the vector of the design or decision variables and\nu the vector of the uncertain parameters. This problem is\ntackled as a weighted sum\n\nmin\nd2D^u2U\n\nwTll\u00fe wTrr \u00f025:7\u00de\n\nor as a constrained optimization problem\n\nmin\nd2D^u2U\n\nl\n\nr? 0\n\u00f025:8\u00de\n\nA conservative approach is to solve the minmax problem\n\nmin\nd2D\n\nmax\nu2U\n\nf d; u\u00f0 \u00de: \u00f025:9\u00de\n\nAlthough this may appear to be an excessively conser-\nvative choice, it has some advantages, as will be illustrated\nlater in this chapter. Note that the design space D and the\nuncertain space U can overlap in the general case, i.e.\nD \\ U 6\u00bc ;, therefore one might want to solve the following\nmodified problem\n\nmin\nd?2D\\U\n\nl \u00bc E f1 d?\n? ?\t \n\n\n; . . .;E fm d?\n? ?\t \n? ?\n\nmin\nd?2D\\U\n\nr \u00bc E f1 d?\n? ?\n? l1\n\n? ?2h i\n; . . .;E fm d?\n\n? ?\n? lm\n\n? ?2h in o\n\n\u00f025:10\u00de\n\nwhere now the decision variable has an uncertain compo-\n\nnent d? \u00bc d\u00fe u. Robust design optimization is generally\ndistinguished from design for reliability that can be for-\nmulated as\n\nmin\nd2D^u2U\n\nf1 d; u\u00f0 \u00de; . . .; fm d; u\u00f0 \u00def g\n\nE c1 d; u\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de ? d1? 0\n\n..\n\n.\n\nE cq d; u\u00f0 \u00de\n? ?\n\n? dq? 0\n\n\u00f025:11\u00de\n\nwhere ci, with i = 1,\u2026,q, are some constraints and di some\nreliability thresholds. Even in this case, the equivalent\nproblem can be considered in which the decision variable\nhas an uncertain component. A recent proposal replaces the\ncomputation of the statistical moments with the computa-\ntion of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and\nminimizes the area between the computed CDF and a ref-\nerence template. Considering the minimum possible value\nof the design budgets df over D? U, the problem becomes\nthe minimization of the robustness index\n\nRI \u00bc\nZ\n\nU\n\nF d; u\u00f0 \u00de ? df\n\n\n \n\ndu: \u00f025:12\u00de\n\n25 Mission and System Design 707\n\n\n\n25.5.3 Probability-Based Approaches\nto Uncertainty Quantification\n\nThe general problem that probability-based approaches face\nis the computation of integrals of the following kind\n\nli d\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nZ\n\nU\n\nf d; u\u00f0 \u00deiPu u\u00f0 \u00dedu \u00f025:13\u00de\n\nwhich corresponds to the i-th statistical moment, where\nf(d, u) is the result of the propagation of the uncertainty\nthrough the model or process. Note that d contains both the\nspatial and the temporal dimensions, i.e. if a process is time\ndependent d contains both the time dependent and time\nindependent components. The random parameter u(x)\nbelongs to the uncertain parameter space U, and x [ X is\nthe realization of u in the probability space (X,F,P) where\nF , 2X is the r-algebra of events and P is a probability\nmeasure. The uncertain parameter u can have a generic\nprobability density function Pu. Equation 25.13 cannot be\ncomputed in closed form in the general case. Approximated\nexpressions using Taylor expansions are possible in some\ncases. If the integral is computed numerically, a suitable\nnumber of values of u must be propagated through the\nmodel and then an appropriate numerical quadrature for-\nmula is required to estimate the integral value. The\nstraightforward approach to the problem would use a direct\nsampling of u according to the distribution Pu (direct Monte\nCarlo simulation) and then the integral is computed with,\nfor example, Newton-Cotes quadrature formulas or again\nthrough a Monte Carlo approach. The direct sampling of\nu and the propagation through the model can be very\nexpensive operations and a large number of samples might\nbe required, which makes the whole process prohibitive.\n\nMore advanced techniques to reduce the computational\ncost have been developed in recent times. The general idea\nis to replace the exact model response f(d, u) with a sur-\nrogate response w(d, u) and then sample the surrogate\nmodel. In some cases the surrogate model is built using an\ninterpolation function defined on structured grids of inte-\ngration nodes so that sampling of w(d, u) is not required.\nTwo popular approaches are mentioned here: generalized\npolynomial chaos expansions (GPCE) and stochastic col-\nlocation (SC). Together they are referred to as stochastic\nexpansion methods.\n\n25.5.4 Approaches to Epistemic Uncertainty\nQuantification\n\nWhen the applied mathematics literature related to infor-\nmation theory and expert systems is examined, one finds a\nnumber of theories that can handle both aleatory and epi-\nstemic uncertainty. Some examples are fuzzy set theory,\n[32\u201335], interval analysis [36, 37], evidence theory [38\u201342],\npossibility theory [43, 44], and theory of upper and lower\nprevisions [45]. Some of these theories only deal with\nepistemic uncertainty; most deal with both epistemic and\naleatory uncertainty; and some deal with other varieties of\nuncertainty, e.g., logic appropriate for artificial intelligence\nand data fusion systems. An article by Klir and Smith [46]\nsummarizes how these theories of uncertainty are related to\none another from a hierarchical point of view. They show\nthat evidence theory is a generalization of classical proba-\nbility theory. From the way that evidence theory measures\nand combines the pieces of evidence supporting one theory\n(or opinion), it can be considered a generalization of pos-\nsibility theory, although in evidence theory and in possi-\nbility theory the mechanics of operations applied to bodies\nof evidence are completely different. Note that in some\ncases evidence theory is referred to as the theory of random\nsets. Also, the use of imprecise probability theories, interval\nanalysis, or fuzzy set theories is not the only approach to\nepistemic uncertainty. Many authors proposed the use of\nprobability theory with the assumption of uniform distri-\nbutions within intervals or p-boxes, defined by intervals,\nand a probability density function defined on the interval. In\nthe reminder, the focus will be on a possible future use of\nevidence theory.\n\n25.5.5 Future Perspective: Evidence-Based\nRobust Design Optimization\n\nShafer\u2019s evidence theory (ET) is a branch of the mathe-\nmatics of uncertain reasoning that allows the decision-\nmaker to deal with uncertain events and incomplete and\nconflicting information [47\u201350]. In ET there are two com-\nplementary measures of uncertainty: belief and plausibility,\nor the lower and upper probabilities that an event can occur.\nGiven all the available pieces of evidence, a single proba-\nbility distribution cannot be specified; rather, a range of\npossible probabilities exists, all of which are consistent with\nthe evidence. Belief and plausibility measures can be based\non many types of information, e.g. experimental data, the-\noretical evidence, individual expert opinion, or consensus\namong experts concerning the range of possible values of a\nparameter or the possibility of the occurrence of an event.\nThere are two main differences between ET and classical\n\n708 M. Vasile et al.\n\n\n\nprobability theory: in ET, no probability distribution func-\ntion needs to be defined and no specific probability needs to\nbe assigned to any value that a variable can assume, the\nevidence of an event and the evidence of its negation do not\nsum up to unity. This means that in ET the absence of\nevidence in support to an event does not imply its negation\nbut leaves the door open to other possibilities.\n\nEvidence theory has been used mainly in information\nfusion, decision making, and risk analysis. Other applica-\ntions are in autonomy and intelligent systems, and planning\nand scheduling under uncertainties. Recently ET has been\nconsidered for applications in the robust design of structures\nand mechanisms in aerospace and civil engineering [22,\n23]. It has also received a growing attention for robust\ndesign optimization. The main reason is that it can incor-\nporate consistently both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty\nin a solid mathematical framework. Furthermore, it is a\ngeneralization of both fuzzy sets and possibility theory.\nRelevant works are connected to the names of Oberkampf\nand Helton, in particular their seminal work on the possible\napplications of evidence theory to engineering problems\n[22], and to the names of Agarwal and Renaud who pro-\nposed the use of evidence theory together with response\nsurfaces and gradient methods [23]. Although not specifi-\ncally intended for engineering applications, relevant works\nthat attempt to make the use of evidence theory efficient\nhave been performed by Tessem [51] and Bauer [52], who\nproposed different techniques to reduce the set of intervals\nthat must be evaluated in order to compute the belief and\nplausibility curves. Several other examples of computa-\ntional techniques exist in the literature that use evidence\ntheory for robust optimization of space systems [24\u201330, 53].\nIt was demonstrated that the use of evidence theory leads to\nmore conservative designs than probability theory, at least if\nthe belief function is used as index of the reliability of a\ndesign point [24]. Evidence theory has been applied to small\nto medium problems in structural design and optimization\n[23, 52]. Recently it was applied to the mutiobjective design\noptimization reusable launchers [24], aerocapture maneu-\nvers [25, 26], and low-thrust trajectories [28\u201330].\n\nIn most current engineering design applications of evi-\ndence theory, experts are expected to express their belief on\nan uncertain parameter u being within a certain set of\nintervals. Each interval can be considered as an elementary\nproposition, and all the intervals form the so-called frame of\ndiscernment H, which is a set of mutually exclusive ele-\nmentary propositions. The frame of discernment can be\nviewed as the counterpart of the finite sample space in\nprobability theory. The power set of H is U = 2H or the set\nof all the subsets of H (the uncertain space in the follow-\ning). The level of confidence an expert has in an element h\nof U is quantified using the basic probability assignment\n(bpa) m(h) that satisfies the axioms\n\nm h\u00f0 \u00de? 0; 8h 2 U \u00bc 2H;\nm h\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 0; 8h 62 U \u00bc 2H;\n\nm ;\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 0;P\nh2U\n\nm h\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1\n\u00f025:14\u00de\n\nAn element of U that has a non-zero bpa is named a focal\nelement. When more than one parameter is uncertain, the\nfocal elements are the result of the Cartesian product of all\nthe elements of each power set associated with each\nuncertain parameter. The bpa of a given focal element is\nthen the product of the bpa of all the elements in the power\nset associated with each parameter. As an example, given\nthe elementary propositions E1 and E2 the power set is\nU \u00bc 0;E1;E2;E1 [ E2f gwhere the disjunctive relation E1 [\nE2 means that u can be either in E1 or in E2. This last point\nis quite important as evidence theory quantifies, through\nE1 [ E2, the degree of ignorance. The bpa assignment then\nbecomes\n\nm E1\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe m E2\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe m E1 [ E2\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc 1: \u00f025:15\u00de\n\nThe belief Bel and the plausibility Pl functions are\ndefined as follows\n\nBel A\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nX\n8hi?A\n\nm hi\u00f0 \u00de; Pl A\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nX\n8hi\\A 6\u00bc0\n\nm hi\u00f0 \u00de \u00f025:16\u00de\n\nwhere A is the proposition about which the belief and\nplausibility need to be evaluated. For example, the propo-\nsition can be expressed as\n\nA \u00bc u 2 Ujf u\u00f0 \u00de? mf g \u00f025:17\u00de\n\nwhere f is the outcome of the system model and the\nthreshold m is the desired value of a design budget (e.g. the\nmass). Thus, focal elements intercepting the set A but not\nincluded in A are considered in Pl but not in Bel.\n\n25.5.5.1 Robust Design Formulations\nAs in Sect. 25.5.2, a design and optimization problem can\nbe formulated assuming epistemic uncertainties quantified\nwith evidence theory. Consider a function f : D? U ! <\ncharacterizing a system to be optimized, where D is the\navailable design space and U the uncertain space. The\nfunction f represents the model of the system budgets (e.g.\npower budget, mass budget, etc.), and depends on some\nuncertain parameters u and design parameters d such that\n\nu 2 U ? <m; d 2 D ? <n: \u00f025:18\u00de\n\nA bpa structure is associated with the frame of discern-\nment U of the uncertain parameters u. From the definition\nof Bel it is clear that the maximum of f over every focal\n\n25 Mission and System Design 709\n\n\n\nelement of U should be computed and compared to m. If the\nmaximum and minimum do not occur at one of the vertices\nof the focal element then an optimization problem has to be\nsolved for every focal element and for each new design\nvector. Because the number of focal elements increases\nexponentially with the number of uncertain parameters and\nassociated intervals, so too does the number of optimization\nproblems.\n\nWhen uncertainty or partial information exists on some\ninputs to a design process or model (represented by the\nfunction f in this section), the interest is to quantify the\nimpact of uncertainty on the outputs (or quantity of inter-\nest). If the function f represents a design budget, say the\nmass of a system, the interest is to quantify the mass mar-\ngin. Furthermore, the design budget and the margin need to\nbe minimal. If one assumes that a Bel = 1 signifies com-\nplete confidence under current information and that Pl = 0\nsignifies impossibility under current information, then the\ntotal margin can be defined as\n\nDf \u00bc mjBel\u00bc1?mjPl\u00bc0: \u00f025:19\u00de\n\nOften designers are interested in the variation of the\nbelief with the threshold m, or in other words with the added\nmargin. Indeed, it may be relevant to take a little more risk\n(a lower value of the belief) if the performance gain is\nsignificant. Therefore, it would be interesting to have a\ncomplete trade-off curve, solution of the bi-objective opti-\nmization problem\n\nmax\nd2D^u2U\n\nBel f d; u;\u00f0 \u00de\\m\u00f0 \u00de\nminm\n\n\u00f025:20\u00de\n\nExamples of the solution of this problem can be found in\n[25\u201328, 30]. The optimal maximum design margin in\nEq. 25.19 can be found by solving the following two opti-\nmization problems\n\nmjBel\u00bc1\u00bc minD max?U\nf d; u\u00f0 \u00de \u00f025:21\u00de\n\nmjPl\u00bc0\u00bc minD min?U\nf d; u\u00f0 \u00de \u00f025:22\u00de\n\nwhere ?U is the normalized collection of all the focal ele-\nments in U. In other words, all the focal elements in U are\nnormalized with respect to the maximum range of the\nuncertain parameters and collected into a compact unit\nhypercube in which all the focal elements are adjacent and\nnot overlapping. If one wants to consider disjunctive ele-\nments of U, care must be put in the construction of the\nbelief and plausibility values. The mass m E1 [ E2\u00f0 \u00demust be\nadded to the computation of the belief (respectively the\nplausibility) if either of the propositions are included in\n\nA (respectively intersects A) but not added twice if both\npropositions are included in A (respectively intersects A).\nThe unit hypercube is built excluding all disjunctive prop-\nositions in U, and then the bpa of every partition of ?U is\ncomputed, checking whether the partition contains at least\none part of a disjunctive proposition. If that is the case, the\nassociated mass is added to the total bpa of the partition. If\nmultiple partitions containing the same elements of a dis-\njunctive proposition are added up, only one mass is\nconsidered.\n\nOther authors focused more on the design for reliability\nassuming epistemic uncertainty. In this case, the problem\ncan be formulated as follows. Let us assume that one has to\nsolve the following constraint minimization problem\n\nmin\nd2D\n\nf d\u00f0 \u00de\nc d; u\u00f0 \u00de? 0:\n\n\u00f025:23\u00de\n\nIf the interest is to maximize the evidence that the con-\nstraints are satisfied also under uncertainty then the problem\ncan be formulated as follows\n\nmin\nd2D\n\nf \u00f0d\u00de\nmin\nd2D\n\nPl\u00f0c\u00f0d; u\u00de[ e\u00de \u00f025:24\u00de\n\nwhere e is an acceptable constraint violation. For an efficient\nsolution of this problem see Zhou et al. [54]. One can also\ncombine robust optimization and reliability maximization in\nthe following integrated formulation [26]\n\nmax\nd2D\n\nBel f d; u\u00f0 \u00de\\m\u00f0 \u00de\nminm\n\nmin\nd2D\n\nPl c d; u\u00f0 \u00de[ e\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00f025:25\u00de\n\n25.5.6 Application Example: Evidence Based\nTelecommunication System Design\n\nThis section describes an example of designing a telecom\nsystem assuming that there are uncertainties on some key\nparameters. The example is used to illustrate the different\nresults that can be obtained by applying the ECSS recom-\nmendation and a more rigorous ET-based quantification of\nthe margins.\n\nAssume that the mass of the telecommunication system\ndepends on the link budget and on the mass of the electronics\nonly. Furthermore, assume that the link budget depends only\non the following parameters: gANT is the efficiency of the\nantenna, Lt is the line losses, Tant is the temperature of the\nantenna, fT is the central frequency of the carrier, Mod is\nthe type of modulation, T is the type of amplifier, and GT is\n\n710 M. Vasile et al.\n\n\n\nthe gain of the transmitting antenna. The mass of the elec-\ntronics depends on the density parameter qCMR.\n\nNow assume that gANT, Lt, Tant and qCMR are uncertain at\nthe beginning of the design process (say in a typical con-\ncurrent design session), while fT, Mod, T and GT can be\n\ncontrolled in order to minimize the mass of the telecom-\nmunication system and the associated margin due to\nuncertainty, i.e. they are the design parameters. Table 25.4\nsummarizes the intervals of variability of the uncertain\nparameter and the associated bpa, namely how much\n\nTable 25.4 TTC bba structure\n\ngANT Interval [0.5 0.6] [0.65 0.75] [0.6 0.8] [0.8 0.95]\n\nbba 0.2 0.5 0.2 0.1\n\nqCMR Interval [0.1 0.2] [0.25 0.3] [0.1 0.3]\n\nbba 0.5 0.35 0.15\n\nLt Interval [1 2] [2 3] [3 5]\n\nbba 0.2 0.3 0.5\n\nTant Interval [200 250] [300 370] [400 500]\n\nbba 0.1 0.6 0.3\n\nTable 25.5 Design space for TTC\n\nParameter Low bound Upper bound\n\nfT (MHz) 7e3 11e3\n\nMod 0 1\n\nT 0 1\n\nGT (dB) 5 20\n\nFig. 25.11 Bel and Pl curves for\nthe TTC system: comparison\nbetween margin estimation and\nevidence in the optimistic case\n\nFig. 25.12 Bel and Pl curves for\nthe TTC system: comparison\nbetween margin estimation and\nevidence in the conservative case\n\n25 Mission and System Design 711\n\n\n\nconfidence the domain experts have in the values that the\nuncertain parameters can assume. Table 25.5 shows instead\nthe range of variability of the design parameters.\n\nThe Bel and Pl curves computed with an exact quanti-\nfication of the uncertainty, and the Bel and Pl associated\nwith the system mass as computed using a margin approach\nbased on experience and the ECSS standards are shown in\nFig. 25.11. It is assumed, in this case, that a designer takes\nthe best possible value for the mass of the system, mjPl\u00bc0,\nand the associated design solution dmin and adds a 25 %\nmargin to the computed power requirement and also to the\nmass of the casing of the electronics. Then the designer\nadds between 0 and 25 %, with 5 % increments, to the\noverall mass of the system and computes the associated Bel\nand Pl. This gives a measure of the credibility of the\ndesigner\u2019s use of the margins. Figure 25.11 demonstrates\nthat even in the case of a 25 % margin at the system level\nthe margin approach based on experience is not able to\ncapture the actual content of uncertainty, reaching less than\n0.6 belief in the mass of the system. Now if one assumes a\nmore conservative approach, in which a 25 % margin is\nadded also to the mass of the antenna and the mass of the\namplifier, the designer will get the result in Fig. 25.12. In\nthis case the expectation of the designer is far too conser-\nvative, overestimating the maximum system mass.\n\nThe Bel margin curve in Fig. 25.12 is computed taking\nthe min/min solution and adding 25 % margin to the link\npower PLd, to the antenna mass, and to the amplifier mass.\nAn additional margin is added to the whole system mass.\nThe belief is computed for different values of the overall\nmargin ranging from 5 to 25 %. The system mass for the\nmaximum overall margin is worse than the min/max solu-\ntion. On the other hand, if the overall system margin is\nreduced below 25 % the belief drops rapidly. Note that the\ncalculation of the actual reliability of the margin solution\nwould not be possible without the use of evidence theory.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
