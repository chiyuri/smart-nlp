I was no older than six when I had this life-changing view of \nthe night sky. I purchased my  fi rst telescope at age 15 and shared it with \nmy siblings and a neighbor girl, Kathy. This was my  fi rst experience \nwith public outreach. \n\n One of my early views of an arti fi cial satellite was of the International \nSpace Station in about the year 2000. I remember watching it grow \nbrighter and reaching a peak brightness directly overhead. \n\n This book is divided into two parts. The  fi rst part (Chaps.   1    ,   2    ,   3    ) \nsummarizes our current knowledge of arti fi cial satellites. I have cho-\nsen to focus on satellites designed to collect scienti fi c data of the Earth \n(Chap.   3    ) and of other bodies    (Chap.   2    ). In the second part (Chaps.   4    , \n  5    ,   6    ), I describe how to observe, image, and study satellites. The last \nchapter describes how to compute the eclipse times of geostationary \nsatellites. \n\n Various    websites are listed in this book, some of which may be \n updated or discontinued by the time this book is published.  Changes    in \nwebsite addresses are bound to happen. What I have seen, though, is \nthat a discontinued website is often replaced by something even better.    \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_2\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_3\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_2\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_4\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_6\n\n\nwwwwwwwwwwwww\n\n\n\nix\n\n   About the Author   \n\n Dr. Richard Schmude, Jr., was born in Washington, D.

In order to launch this object, Soviet engineers had to \novercome several obstacles including gravity, the proper functioning of the rocket, \nair resistance, tracking and insertion of the satellite into orbit. Since 1957, several \nnations have launched satellites. These instruments are used for a wide variety of \napplications that include space studies, communication, military, agriculture, \nweather observation and land/ocean studies. The  fi rst three chapters describe the \ndifferent spacecraft observing both Earth and bodies beyond Earth. Chapters   4    ,   5    , \nand   6     describe how one may observe, image and study satellites. \n\n In this chapter, we focus on the launch and operation of a satellite. Accordingly, it \nis broken into eight parts, which are the atmosphere, rockets, launch and operation \nof a satellite, electromagnetic radiation and the Doppler effect, satellite communica-\ntion and tracking, satellite lifetime, satellite visibility and satellite applications. \n\n   The Atmosphere \n Earth is surrounded by a blanket of gas called the atmosphere. Gravity keeps it in \nplace. Without gravity, it would spread out into space. Furthermore, if Earth\u2019s grav-\nity were one sixth of what it is as on our Moon, most of the air we breathe probably \nwould have escaped long ago. Earth\u2019s higher gravity is why we have an atmosphere \nwhereas our Moon lacks one. \n\n Gravity is why our atmosphere exerts pressure. At sea level, gases above exert a \npressure of 1.0 atm. This is equivalent to 14.7 lb per square inch, or 760 Torr. The \npressure  fl uctuates by a few tenths of a percent depending on weather conditions. \nIn rare cases, such as in a tornado or a hurricane, the pressure may drop several \npercent. \n\n Our atmosphere changes with altitude. Both the pressure and density drop with \nincreasing altitude. Table  1.1  lists both the pressure and density in different parts \nof the troposphere.  \n\n Our atmosphere has four layers. The lowest one, the troposphere, extends from \nEarth\u2019s surface to an altitude of between 7 and 18 km. The altitude depends on \nthe latitude. The troposphere extends to 18 km at the equator but only 7 km at a \npole. The temperature almost always falls with increasing altitude in this layer. \n\nR.

It \nextends to about 50 km above sea level. Figure  1.1  was taken from a balloon at an \naltitude of 25 km. It shows the bluish troposphere and the black stratosphere. \nThe pressure in this layer ranges from 0.3 to 0.001 atm.  \n\n Above the stratosphere lies the mesosphere. Temperatures fall with increasing \naltitude here. The air is about 10,000 times thinner in the mesosphere than it is at \nsea level. In spite of this, the air is thick enough to cause meteors to burn up. In fact \nthe  Columbia  space shuttle broke apart in 2003 when it was passing through the \nmesosphere. Noctilucent clouds occur at an altitude of around 80 km, which is near \nthe upper boundary of this layer. \n\n The thermosphere is the highest layer. Temperatures rise with increasing \naltitude here. The gas density essentially reaches zero at an altitude of 800 km. \n\n   Table 1.1.

Figure  1.2  \nillustrates the layers of the atmosphere. The temperature of the thermosphere \nmay be 200\u00b0C hotter in the daytime than at night. This change affects the pressure \nand density. Temperature changes may also affect the orbits and lifetimes of satel-\nlites. This is discussed later.  \n\n The ionosphere contains lots of charged particles. It lies 100\u2013300 km above sea \nlevel. Ham radio operators utilize this region when they communicate with those \non other continents. Essentially, radio waves bounce off the ionosphere.  \n\n   Air Resistance \n Why does a feather fall slower than a rock? The answer is air resistance. Although \nthe feather and rock feel gravitational pull, the rock falls faster because air resist-\nance does not affect the rock\u2019s movement as much as the feather\u2019s movement. Air \nresistance is a frictional force between a moving object and air. It depends on sev-\neral factors, including the object\u2019s speed and surface area. One may write the fol-\nlowing for a falling object:\n\n     = -Downward net force gravitational force air resistance force    (1.1)   \n\n In many cases, the gravitational force will equal the air resistance force. When \nthis happens, the downward net force will equal zero, and the object will fall at a \nconstant velocity. \n\n Table  1.2  lists the measured acceleration of several objects dropped from a \nheight of 2 m. Recall that acceleration is the change in velocity divided by the time \ninterval. Without air resistance, the measured acceleration for all objects would be \n9.81 m/s 2 . As it turns out, all of the objects fall with accelerations less than this \namount. Air resistance causes this. Figure  1.3  shows the distance, in meters, that \nobjects fall in 0.64 s. The hypothetical object K has no air resistance and it falls \nfarther than the others. The object experiencing the most air resistance (the bal-\nloon) falls the least amount.   \n\n  Fig. 1.2.    The four layers of Earth\u2019s atmosphere at a latitude of 45\u00b0N. The approximate altitudes of the  troposphere ,  stratosphere ,  mesosphere  \nand  thermosphere  at 45\u00b0N are 0\u201313 km, 13\u201350 km, 50\u201385 km and above 85 km, respectively (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n4\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n B\na\nsi\n\ncs\n\n As a rocket rises, its velocity increases, its mass decreases and the air density \ndecreases. This will cause the air resistance to change. In a typical launch, the \nrocket velocity increases and, hence, the air resistance force increases. Once the \nrocket is high enough, the air thins out enough for the air resistance force to drop \nin spite of the higher velocity. The air at an altitude of 200 km is so thin that air \nresistance is negligible.  \n\n   Rockets \n Have you ever watched a rocket launch? If so, do you think that it was moving at \nan initial speed of 28,000 km/h? (This is the speed needed to launch a satellite into \norbit.) The answer is no. When a rocket lifts off its speed is much slower than this. \nIt increases with time. Eventually, it reaches the speed needed to place a satellite \nin orbit. \n\n The Saturn V rocket, used for the  Apollo 11  Moon mission, started off slowly. \nAfter 8 s, it was only 120 m above the ground. During this time it was moving at \nan average speed of 55 km/h. It also had an average acceleration of 4 m/s 2 . The \nair resistance force was small during the  fi rst few seconds after liftoff. The speed \n\n   Table 1.2.    Measured acceleration of several objects when dropped from a height of 2 m.

Object K falls at an acceleration rate \nof 9.81 m/s 2  and does not experience any air resistance. These results are based on experimental data that Chad Davies and the author collected.       \n\n \n\n\n\n5\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n B\na\nsi\n\ncs\n\nof the rocket continued to increase, however, as it rose into space. Once it was \nhigh enough, its speed increased to the point where it was able to launch the \nspacecraft at the proper velocity. In essence, air resistance retarded the rocket\u2019s \nupward movement. To make matters more complicated, the air resistance \ndepended on the air temperature, pressure and composition. It is for this reason \nthat during the launch of the Saturn V, engineers monitored its velocity and \nacceleration. If adjustments needed to be made, the appropriate commands \nwould have been sent to the crew. \n\n What causes a rocket to move? One common misconception is that the exhaust \npushes against the ground. This is not what happens. Instead it moves upward \nbecause of Newton\u2019s Third Law of Motion, which states: \u201cFor every action, there is \nan equal and opposite reaction.\u201d This is why a gun kicks after being  fi red. See \nFig.  1.4 . If one wants to launch a rocket straight up it is necessary to orient it so that \nit exerts a force straight down. Essentially, when material exits in one direction, the \nrocket moves in the other direction. See Fig.  1.5 .   \n\n  Fig. 1.4.    When a shotgun is  fi red, the shot is propelled out of the barrel, and at the same time, the gun pushes back, which is its kick (Credit: \nRichard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n  Fig. 1.5.    When exhaust is pushed in one direction, the rocket moves in the opposite direction (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n6\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n B\na\nsi\n\ncs\n\n The thrust is the force a rocket engine exerts. With a thrust of 5,000 N it may lift \n5,000 N. Keep in mind though that most of this 5,000 N includes the weight of the \nlaunch vehicle and fuel. Therefore, if a rocket and its fuel weigh 4,000 N and the \nthrust is 5,000 N the maximum weight that may be lifted is 1,000 N. \n\n Many large rockets have two, three or four stages. The advantage of this is that \ndead weight can be expelled. Figure  1.6  illustrates the basic launch process for a \ntwo-stage rocket.  \n\n Have you ever tried to balance an object on top of your head? Essentially, you \nwould hold your head steady, and if the object began to move to the left you would \nmove to prevent the object from moving further. A rocket works in the same way. \nIn an ideal case, it will move straight up initially and afterwards will arc. Once it is \nhigh enough, its movement will be nearly parallel to Earth\u2019s surface. In most cases, \nit shifts from the planned path. Winds, air turbulence and changes in the mass \ndistribution are responsible for this. Because of small rocket movements, operators \nshould steer it. This is accomplished with gimbals and thrusters. A few rockets also \nhave  fi ns near their base. These also serve as a source of stability. \n\n   Model Rocket Launch \n\n Let\u2019s think about the launch of a 9.5 lb  fi berglass model rocket. It contains an altim-\neter and other equipment that are able to record the velocity, acceleration, altitude \nand barometric pressure during  fl ight. It has a solid propellant engine (K550W \nrocket engine). Figure  1.7  shows a typical thrust curve. One pound of thrust equals \n4.45 N. The rocket is loaded with its engine and placed on the launch site. It is \naligned with a steel rod. After it is in place, a small igniter is attached. Once every-\nthing is in place, the  fi eld is cleared and the countdown starts:  fi ve, four, three, two, \none, the igniter is lit and after about a second the rocket shoots up. See Fig.  1.8 . Note \nthe hot gas coming from the bottom. Since the gas moves downward, the rocket \nmoves upward. During the  fi rst 2 m of  fl ight, it moves up the rod. Figure  1.9  shows \nthe altitude at different times. The engine burns for about 3 s. During the  fi rst 2.3 s, \nit exerts a thrust of between 120 and 180 lb or 530 and 800 N. During the next 0.7 s, \n\n  Fig. 1.6.    The sequence of events for launching a two-stage rocket (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n  Fig. 1.7.

After 3.0 s, the fuel runs out. At this point, the engine shuts down \nand the rocket is moving nearly straight up at a speed of 960 km/h. It continues to \nmove upwards for another 10 s or so. Air resistance causes the upward velocity to \ndrop. Once it reaches an altitude of about 1,800 m its upward velocity is zero, and it \nbegins falling. Since this rocket does not attain a speed of 28,000 km/h it is unable \nto orbit Earth. Shortly after it begins falling, a parachute opens. Afterwards it falls \nat a nearly constant speed of 66 km/h.    \n\n Figure  1.10  shows the atmospheric pressure near the rocket. The pressure \nequaled 0.77 atm at the maximum altitude. This was much lower than on the \nground (0.97 atm).  \n\n  Fig. 1.8.    Liftoff of a model rocket. During the  fi rst 2 m of its journey it moved up the metal post. This helped it move upwards (Credit: Chris Keir).       \n\n  Fig. 1.9.

Engine thrust causes the \nvelocity to increase during the  fi rst 3 s of  fl ight. Afterwards, air resistance causes \nthe velocity to fall. Table  1.3  lists the velocities, accelerations and altitudes at dif-\nferent times in the  fl ight.   \n\n Larger rockets work in the same way as smaller ones. Both require thrust in \norder to accelerate. If they do not reach a speed of over 28,000 km/h, they fall back. \nAir resistance and wind also affect the trajectory regardless of rocket size. \n\n  Fig. 1.10.    The atmospheric pressure the rocket experienced during the  fi rst 26 s of  fl ight. It reached a maximum altitude about 15 s after \nliftoff.

If the \nengine could have burned for 1 min with 667 N of thrust, the rocket would have \nreached a velocity of 28,000 km/h in the absence of air resistance. \n\n Figure  1.12  shows how the force of air resistance (or the drag force) changes \nfor different velocities. At a velocity of 750 km/h, the drag force reaches 100 N, \nor 22.5 lb.  \n\n How does air resistance affect the rocket trajectory? A quick look back at \nFig.  1.7  shows that the average thrust of the engine was about 150 lb (667 N). The \nrocket and its fuel had a mass of 4.5 kg at liftoff, and it may have had a mass of \n4.1 kg after 2 s in  fl ight. Therefore, its average mass was near 4.3 kg during its  fi rst \n2 s of  fl ight. Using an equation from physics (force = mass \u00d7 acceleration, or \nacceleration = force \u00f7 mass) one may compute the acceleration (assuming no air \nresistance) as\n\n     = \u00b8 =2 2rocket acceleration  667 kg m / s 4.3 kg  155 m / s    (1.2)   \n\n One may also compute the velocity after 2 s from Eq.  1.2  (assuming no air \n resistance) as\n\n     = + \u00b4velocity  initial velocity  acceleration  time    (1.3)   \n\n   Table 1.3.

The velocity \nis computed as:\n\n     = + \u00b42velocity 0 155 m / s 2.0 s = 310 m / s    (1.4)   \n\n This velocity (310 m/s) is equal to 1,116 km/h. This is how fast the rocket would \nhave moved in the absence of air resistance. In the actual launch, the velocity after \n2 s was 222 m/s, or 800 km/h. Therefore, air resistance resulted in the velocity being \nabout 72% of what it would have been.  \n\n   Rocket Propulsion \n\n Engineers have developed several ways of propelling large rockets. They use either \nsolid fuel or liquid fuel for rockets designed to launch a satellite into orbit. In the \ncase of smaller rockets already in outer space, they use pressurized gas or ion pro-\npulsion. It may also be possible to use a nuclear reactor someday as a source of \npropulsion.   \n\n   Satellites \n In this section, we will describe some major steps in the construction and launch \nof a satellite. Afterwards, we will describe the different satellite orbits and how \ninstruments are placed in orbits around other bodies. Finally, the Lagrangian \npoints, satellite power sources and the rendezvous of two objects in orbit will be \ndiscussed. \n\n   Construction and Launch of a Satellite \n\n Once technicians assemble a satellite it is subjected to several tests. This is to insure \nproper operation in outer space. It may undergo a spin test to ensure that it sur-\nvives being spun in space. It should undergo the vibration test. This is because the \nride on a rocket is often bumpy. If instruments do not function after the vibration \ntest, changes would have to be made. In many cases an electromagnetic test is also \ncarried out. The purpose of this is to insure that one instrument\u2019s electric and \nmagnetic  fi eld does not affect another instrument. A satellite should also pass a \nthermal vacuum test. Essentially, it is placed into a chamber and the air is pumped \nout to simulate the vacuum of space. During this test, the instruments must operate \nproperly. Once a satellite has passed these tests, it is ready for launch. \n\n A satellite launch is something that requires lots of planning. The appropriate \nlaunch vehicle is selected. A large and more expensive vehicle should not be \nused when a smaller one will do the job. A rocket must be launched over unpop-\nulated areas. \n\n The launch date is selected based on several factors, including the positions of \ncurrent satellites. The Collision Avoidance List gives information about large \nobjects orbiting Earth and is consulted. Once a launch time is selected, warnings \n\n\n\n11\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n B\na\nsi\n\ncs\n\nare issued to ships to avoid the areas below the rocket path. Shortly before launch, \nthe fuel is put into the rocket. \n\n Before launch, meteorologists are consulted for the latest weather updates. Wind \nshear can destroy a rocket and is illustrated in Fig.  1.13 . It occurs when two nearby \nlayers of air move in different directions. Other weather problems include light-\nning, high winds and strong air turbulence. Engineers and technicians also check \nthe equipment. Once everything is ready, engines are  fi red and the rocket lifts off.  \n\n Figure  1.14  illustrates the basic steps in a typical launch. The rocket blasts off \nand moves straight up. As it moves, it accelerates, and as a result its velocity \nincreases. As it gains altitude, engines are adjusted, causing the trajectory to bend. \nSmaller engines are adjusted to compensate for any shifts in the trajectory. About \n2 min after liftoff, the rocket attains an altitude of about 50 km. At this point it is \nmoving at an angle of about 45\u00b0. This is also about the time when the  fi rst stage \nruns out of fuel and is ejected. The empty stage falls. (This is one reason why rock-\nets are launched over unpopulated areas.) The second stage engine ignites. It con-\ntinues to accelerate and changes direction until it is almost parallel to Earth\u2019s \nsurface. Once the second stage runs out of fuel, it is ejected and also falls. The third \nstage  fi res its engine and accelerates until it moves at the required velocity. At this \npoint the satellite may be 400 km above Earth\u2019s surface. When the third stage runs \nout of fuel it is ejected and the payload is released into orbit. In some cases a satel-\nlite has small engines. These allow engineers to adjust its orbit. Unlike the  fi rst two \nstages, the third stage may remain in orbit around Earth.  \n\n Once a satellite moves fast enough it orbits Earth. What is happening here is that \nit moves straight and falls to Earth at the same time. This is why the orbit is curved. \nSee Fig.  1.15 . We see this same curved path every time one throws a ball. Essentially, \nthe ball moves straight and falls at the same time. See Fig.  1.16 . When it is thrown \nharder it moves father but still follows a curved path.   \n\n  Fig. 1.13.    An illustration of wind shear. Essentially, this occurs when two nearby layers of air move in different directions (Credit: Richard \nSchmude, Jr.).       \n\n  Fig. 1.14.    The four basic steps in the launch of a satellite with a three-stage rocket; these steps are  A  the rocket lifts off;  B  the  fi rst stage lifts \nthe rocket to a certain altitude, runs out of fuel and is ejected;  C  the second stage lifts the rocket higher, runs out of fuel and is ejected; and  D  the third \nstage lifts the satellite into orbit, runs out of fuel and is ejected (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n12\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n B\na\nsi\n\ncs\n\n One of the great achievements of Sir Isaac Newton was that he proved that grav-\nity causes an apple to fall from a tree and is what causes the Moon to move around \nEarth. He proved that Earth\u2019s gravitational  fi eld extends into space. The further one \nis from Earth, the weaker Earth\u2019s gravitational tug becomes. In fact, satellites \n orbiting Earth experience small gravitational tugs from both our Moon and Sun. \n\n Did you know that Earth\u2019s movement can help launch a satellite into orbit? This \nis because of rotation. Since the equator is wider than other latitudes, it has the \nhighest rotational speed. See Fig.  1.17 . The speed of the Earth at the equator is \n1,674 km/h. Since a rocket standing at the equator moves with Earth, it has an \neastward speed of 1,674 km/h with respect to space. On the other hand, at 45\u00b0N \nlatitude the corresponding velocity is 1,184 km/h.  \n\n Space agencies want launch sites to be near the equator. This is a major reason \nwhy the European Space Agency has a launch site in French Guiana (along the \nnortheastern coast of South America). It is near the equator. \n\n  Fig. 1.15.    A satellite undergoes two movements simultaneously, namely straight and downward. These are shown as  dashed lines . The result \nof these two movements is the curved path ( solid line ) (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n  Fig. 1.16.    A ball is thrown straight and it undergoes two simultaneous movements. These are in the direction thrown and downward. The two \nmovements are shown as  dashed lines .

Since the aircraft was \nmoving eastward it gave the satellite an extra boost. See Fig.  1.18 .   \n\n   Satellite Orbits \n\n Satellites may follow either a circular orbit or an elliptical orbit. In a circular one, \nan object is always at the same distance from Earth\u2019s center. In an elliptical one, the \ndistance between the satellite and Earth\u2019s center changes. The orbits are illustrated \nin Fig.  1.19 . Perigee is the point closest to Earth and apogee is the point farthest \nfrom Earth.  \n\n The size of the orbit determines how fast a satellite moves. Table  1.4  lists orbital \nperiods for several circular orbits. The altitude is the shortest distance between the \nsatellite and Earth\u2019s surface.  \n\n Four common categories of orbits are low-Earth, low-eccentricity; low-Earth, \nhigh-eccentricity; high-Earth, high-eccentricity; and geostationary. All four are \nillustrated in Fig.  1.20 . An example of a satellite  fl ying in low-Earth, low eccentric-\nity orbit is the International Space Station (ISS). On June 18, 2010, it was 350 km \nabove Earth\u2019s surface. On this date, the orbital eccentricity was 0.02. The Russian \n Molniya  satellite  fi ts into the second category. This satellite serves the population \nat high northern latitudes. The Chandra X-Ray Observatory is an example of a \nsatellite in the third category. It has a perigee distance of 29,000 km and an apogee \ndistance of 120,000 km.  Amazonas 2,  a communications satellite, follows a geosta-\ntionary orbit. This satellite\u2019s orbital period equals Earth\u2019s rotational period. \nTherefore, its position relative to Earth does not change much.  \n\n The orbital inclination is the angle between the satellite\u2019s orbital plane and \nEarth\u2019s equator. When the inclination equals 0\u00b0 the satellite moves overhead at the \n\n  Fig. 1.18.    The Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) satellite was launched with a Pegasus rocket from a high altitude jet plane. The speed of \nthe high altitude jet plane with respect to outer space (a sum of its speed and Earth\u2019s rotational speed) is  J , the speed of the rocket with respect to the \njet after launch is  R  and the speed of the rocket with respect to outer space is  J + R . The two advantages of this launch are the rocket gets an extra \nboost from the moving plane, and the launch is several kilometers above sea level and, hence, the satellite does not have to travel as far to get to \nouter space (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n14\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n B\na\nsi\n\ncs\n\nequator. When the inclination equals 90\u00b0 the satellite moves over the poles. Many \nsatellites that can be observed have inclinations close to 90\u00b0. Geostationary satel-\nlites have inclinations near 0\u00b0. \n\n Does a satellite  fl y over the same location on Earth? With the exception of \ngeostationary satellites, the answer is no. This is because Earth is always rotating. \nThe ground trace is the track that an orbiting object makes over Earth\u2019s surface. \nFor example, let\u2019s assume a satellite is launched from Hammaguira French Special \nWeapons Test Centre in Algeria in a polar orbit. The orbital period is 1.5 h. \nAlthough the satellite is moving fast, Earth rotates at a rate of 15\u00b0 per hour, or \n22.5\u00b0 for each orbit. As a result, the ground trace shifts 22.5\u00b0 of longitude every \n1.5 h. See Fig.  1.21 .  \n\n A space station is an orbiting arti fi cial satellite that is able to support one or \nmore astronauts for an extended time. Table  1.5  lists a few space stations. Two of \nthese lasted for over a decade. The two largest,  Mir  and the ISS had to be assembled \n\n  Fig. 1.19.    A circular ( a ) and elliptical ( b ) orbit.

One \nof these is to launch something fast enough to escape Earth\u2019s gravitational  fi eld. \nIn essence, the rocket does all of the work of pushing the satellite to the point \nwhere it escapes. In the second method, the rocket does most of the work and \nthe satellite does the rest. Essentially, the rocket pushes the satellite into an \nelliptical transfer orbit. Afterwards, engineers  fi re the satellite\u2019s engine and it \nescapes from Earth. \n\n A third method of launching a satellite to another planet is the gravitational \nslingshot technique. Essentially, the rocket does some of the work and the gravita-\ntional  fi eld of a massive object does the rest. See Fig.  1.22 . For example, engineers \nused the gravitational  fi eld of Jupiter to both boost the speed of the  New Horizons  \nspacecraft and to change its trajectory.  \n\n How do engineers cause a fast-moving satellite to orbit a planet? There are \ntwo ways of doing this. One of these is to use rockets to adjust the velocity. \nEssentially this causes the velocity to drop. This in turn will cause the planet to \ncapture the satellite. A second way of doing this is aerobraking. This is a tech-\nnique whereby one utilizes an atmosphere to slow down a spacecraft. Let\u2019s \ndescribe a recent example. \n\n Engineers used aerobraking to insert the  Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)  \ninto the desired orbit around Mars. In this case, the  MRO  arrived at Mars in a \nhighly elliptical orbit. Over the next few weeks, engineers forced the  MRO  to dip to \nan altitude of 105 km at perigee. The  MRO  was still traveling too fast to fall into its \ndesired orbit at that time. See Fig.  1.23a . When the  MRO  reached perigee Mars\u2019 \natmosphere was thick enough to exert a gentle frictional force, which over time \n\n   Table 1.5.

To \nillustrate this, let\u2019s recount humankind\u2019s  fi rst journey to the Moon. \n\n Figure  1.24  summarizes brie fl y the  Apollo 8  Moon mission. This is based on the \ndescription in Baker  (  1981  ) . In this mission, three astronauts (Bill Anders, Frank \nBorman and Jim Lovell) blasted off from Earth and entered a low-Earth, low- \neccentricity orbit. They followed this path for about 2.5 h before  fi ring the third-stage \nrocket. This enabled them to escape form Earth\u2019s gravity (a  fi rst for humankind). \nA short time later, the third stage was ejected. At this point, the CSM (Command \nService Module) was moving at a speed of almost 39,000 km/h.  \n\n Earth\u2019s gravity caused the CSM to slow down as it moved away from Earth. As \na result, its speed fell to 4,300 km/h 2.4 days later. At this point, however, it \nentered the Moon\u2019s gravitational  fi eld. This was an historical event. As the CSM \napproached the Moon, its speed increased to 9,400 km/h. This was too high for \nthe spacecraft to orbit, and, hence, the astronauts  fi red a rocket engine. This \nreduced the speed. \n\n The CSM orbited the Moon, and after ten orbits, the crew  fi red the rocket, caus-\ning it to escape. As it moved farther from the Moon, its speed fell. When the space-\ncraft crossed the point where it was under the in fl uence of Earth\u2019s gravity its speed \nincreased. It fell back to the home planet. Once the crew was close enough to Earth, \nthey  fi red the rocket one more time, causing the CSM to slow down and fall back \nsafely through the atmosphere. \n\n  Fig. 1.24.    Major steps in the  Apollo 8  mission.  Step 1  \u2013 Rocket launches the Command Service Module (CSM) into low-Earth orbit;  Step 2  \n\u2013 Astronauts  fi re a rocket, the CSM escapes Earth\u2019s gravity and moves to the Moon;  Step 3  \u2013 Astronauts reduce their speed with a rocket burn and \nthe CSM orbits the Moon;  Step 4  \u2013 After ten orbits, astronauts  fi re a rocket and the CSM escapes from the  Moon  and heads back to Earth; and \n Step 5  \u2013 Astronauts cause the CSM to slow down with a rocket burn and it falls back to Earth. In  Steps 2  and  4 , the length of the dash is proportional \nto the CSM speed (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n19\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n B\na\nsi\n\ncs\n\n It takes a satellite less time to orbit our Moon than Earth. This is because our \nMoon\u2019s gravity is weaker. Kepler\u2019s Third Law predicts the orbital period around \nany particular body using:\n\n     ( )1/23P = a k    (1.5)   \n In this equation, P is the orbital period in days, a is the average distance to a \n\nbody\u2019s center in km and k is a constant. Values of k for different Solar System bod-\nies are listed in Table  1.6 . Table  1.7  lists the  fi rst satellites to orbit other Solar System \nbodies.    \n\n   Lagrangian Points \n\n In 1772, Joseph Lagrange demonstrated that in the presence of two high-mass bod-\nies, m 1  and m 2 , a third body, m 3 , may remain in a stable position. Five areas where \nthis occurs are the Lagrangian points and are labeled L 1 , L 2 , L 3 , L 4  and L 5 . The posi-\ntions of L 1 , L 2 , L 4  and L 5  are shown in Fig.  1.25  for Earth and the Sun. The L 3  point \nlies on the Earth-Sun line and is opposite from Earth. The L 1 , L 2  and L 3  points cover \nsmall areas. If a satellite is at one of these points and experiences a small force, it \nwill begin to oscillate. This is not the case, however, if it is at L 4  or L 5 . This is because \nL 4  and L 5  are larger areas of stability. In order for L 4  and L 5  to remain as areas of \nstability, m 2  (Earth) must be less than 0.04 times the mass of m 1  (Sun) and m 3  \n(satellite) must have a lower mass than m 2 . Several satellites are at the Earth-Sun \nLagrangian points.   \n\n   Table 1.6.    Kepler\u2019s third law for bodies in our solar system.

Power is needed to keep \nthe computer, communications equipment, scienti fi c instruments and thrusters \nfunctioning properly. Three sources of power are solar panels, batteries and radio-\nisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Each of these will be described. \n\n Solar panels are an ideal way for satellites to generate power. Essentially, sunlight \nstrikes a panel of solar cells that convert the sunlight into electricity. Solar power \nis often used to recharge batteries. In the vicinity of Earth, the Sun gives off \n1,366 W/m 2 . This means sunlight having an energy of 1,366 J strikes a 1 m 2  surface \neach second. The surface must face the Sun directly. See Fig.  1.26 . The ef fi ciency is \nthe fraction of sunlight power that is converted into useful forms.  \n\n For example, a solar panel with an ef fi ciency of 0.100 (or 10.0%) converts one-\ntenth of the sunlight into electricity. Therefore, when an Earth-orbiting satellite \n\n   Table 1.7.

Therefore, \nsatellites orbiting Solar System bodies beyond Mars usually have additional power \nsources besides solar panels. \n\n Engineers have used radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) for a few \nsatellites. An RTG converts heat, generated from the radioactive decay of an \n\n  Fig. 1.25.    Four of the  fi ve Lagrangian points for the Earth-Sun system are illustrated.

The RTGs on  Cassini  contain plutonium-238 ( 238 Pu). Each \nRTG provided 295 W of power in 1997. The decay of  238 Pu caused the RTGs to \nproduce less power during the  fi rst decade of the twenty- fi rst century. At some \npoint, the RTGs will no longer be able to supply enough power to keep  Cassini  \nfunctioning. \n\n Batteries are a third power source. They contain two or more substances that \nreact to produce an electrical potential or voltage. Different batteries produce dif-\nferent voltages. For example, the common AA battery produces an electrical poten-\ntial of 1.5 V. Satellite batteries are rechargeable.  \n\n   Rendezvous \n\n How does one steer a satellite to a second one moving thousands of miles per hour? \nThe answer is, very carefully. Essentially, rendezvous is the task of steering one \nsatellite toward a second one. The two objects should have the same orbit and \nnearly the same velocity when they meet. There are several examples of rendez-\nvous. For example, every time a cargo ship docked with the ISS, it underwent ren-\ndezvous. It also occurred during the  Apollo  Moon landings. Finally, the Japanese \nspacecraft  Hayabusa  made a rendezvous with the Earth-crossing asteroid 25143 \nItokawa in 2005. This mission is described further in Chap.   2    .   \n\n   Electromagnetic Radiation \nand the Doppler Effect \n Radio waves, infrared radiation, visible light and gamma rays are all examples of \nelectromagnetic radiation. All of these have both an electric and a magnetic wave. \nThe waves are at 90\u00b0 angles from each other. All electromagnetic waves travel at the \nspeed of light (2.998 \u00d7 10 8  m/s) in a vacuum. The wavelength is the length of one \nwave. See Fig.  1.27 .  \n\n The frequency is the number of waves that pass a  fi xed point each second. The \nproduct of the wavelength and frequency is the speed. Table  1.8  lists frequency \nranges for different examples of electromagnetic radiation.  \n\n  Fig. 1.27.    The wavelength (  ?  ) of electromagnetic radiation is the length of one complete cycle of the wave (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_2\n\n\n23\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n B\na\nsi\n\ncs\n Have you ever noticed how the sound of a race car changes as it approaches and \n\npasses? The sound has a higher pitch as it approaches and a lower one as it moves \naway. This is an example of the Doppler effect. Essentially, the frequency (or pitch) \ngets higher as the sound source (race car) approaches. As the car moves away, the \npitch gets lower. See Fig.  1.28 .  \n\n Electromagnetic radiation may also undergo a change in frequency. This occurs \nwhen the radiation source is moving towards or away from us. See Fig.  1.29 . In this \n fi gure, the satellite gives off radio waves with a frequency of 9.00000 GHz.

It is vital for keeping the satellite \nin the correct position, receiving data, sending commands and diagnostics. \n\n Gyroscopes allow satellites to maintain the correct position, which is de fi ned \nin three dimensions. See Fig.  1.30 . These three are called roll, pitch and yaw. It is \nessential for a satellite to be in the correct position in order for it to transmit \nand receive commands. Furthermore, instruments must be pointed at the cor-\nrect target.  \n\n Satellites are designed to transmit or relay radio signals back to Earth. Modest-\nsized radio dishes may detect nearby signals. Larger ones are needed for fainter \nsignals coming from distant satellites. This is because signal intensity drops with \nincreasing distance. The Deep Space Network is an array of large radio dishes in \nGoldstone, California; Canberra, Australia; and near Madrid, Spain. See Fig.  1.31 . \nSeveral distant satellites were operating in late 2011; therefore, competition for \nfacilities is great. China also has an extensive deep space network. Several radio \nreceivers are spread across that country. See Fig.  1.32 .    \n\n  Fig. 1.29.    A satellite uses a frequency of 9.00000 GHz. Since it is moving towards the receiver at a speed of 6 km/s, the frequency reaching \nit is 9.00018 GHz because of the Doppler effect (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n  Fig. 1.30.

For example, our Sun may cause our \natmosphere to expand. This would lead to a satellite slowing down and burning \nup in the atmosphere. See Fig.  1.33 . A collision with a small object may destroy \ninstruments.  \n\n According to a NASA website, one of the  Themis  satellites was struck by an object \nin October 2010. Intense radiation from our Sun may cause a computer to shut \n\n  Fig. 1.31.

Large radio dishes in China are located in six different areas spanning almost 50\u00b0 of longitude. The radio dishes are up to 50 m \nacross.

For example, McDowell  (  2009g  )  reports that the  Gravity Probe B  satellite \ntemporarily shut down because of an intense burst of solar wind. If the thrusters \nfail, communication would become dif fi cult. One reason for the Hubble Space \nTelescope servicing missions was to replace worn out gyroscopes. Without gyro-\nscopes technicians cannot control its position. A loss of coolant may render an \ninstrument useless. Many instruments require a coolant, such as liquid nitrogen, to \nfunction properly. \n\n Several satellites also survive beyond their planned lifetime. In many cases, extra \nmoney is allocated. This allows astronomers to collect additional data. Table  1.9  \nlists examples of planned and extended lifetimes.   \n\n   Satellite Visibility \n Satellites re fl ect light from the Sun. This is why we see them. The amount of light \nthey re fl ect depends on several factors, including albedo, phase, distance and size. \nIt also depends on the mode of re fl ection (specular or diffuse). \n\n The albedo is the fraction of light an object re fl ects. Freshly fallen snow re fl ects \nabout 80% of the light falling on it, whereas charcoal re fl ects less than 10% of the \nlight falling on it. The higher a satellite\u2019s albedo, the more light it re fl ects. \n\n  Fig. 1.33.    The Sun may cause a planetary atmosphere to expand, which in turn may be disastrous for a satellite. ( a ) A satellite moves in an \nelliptical orbit and at its closest point is still above the atmosphere; ( b ) The atmosphere expands and, as a result, the satellite experiences a drag force \nas it moves through the upper atmosphere; ( c ) The orbit of the satellite changes over many weeks because of the new drag force; and ( d ) The satel-\nlite gets low enough for it to burn up (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n27\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n B\na\nsi\n\ncs\n\n Which is brighter: a full Moon or a crescent Moon? The full moon is brighter. \nThis is because: (1) it has a larger illuminated area and (2) it has almost no shad-\nows. Shadows cause less light to be re fl ected and, hence, darken an area. See \nFig.  1.34 . Note that the right edge of Mars is darker than the left edge. This is caused \nby numerous shadows on the right edge. Most of the shadows are too small to see, \nbut their combined effect is visible.  \n\n   Table 1.9.

Diffuse and specular \nare two modes of re fl ection. In most cases, a surface re fl ects sunlight in many \ndirections. This is diffuse re fl ection. Since light is re fl ected in many directions, it \ngrows dimmer with increasing distance. Figure  1.35  illustrates what is happening. \nEssentially, a diffuse re fl ector re fl ects light in many directions. In many cases, it \nre fl ects light in all directions within 90\u00b0 of the line de fi ned by the incoming light. \nFurthermore, the light is spread out uniformly in all directions. When this is the \ncase, we have the situation shown in Fig.  1.36 .   \n\n Essentially, the amount of light going through one square at a distance of 1 m \nequals the amount of light going through four squares at a distance of 2 m. Keep in \nmind that the amount of light entering our eye pupils controls the perceived \nbrightness. Therefore, only one-fourth of the light at 1 m enters our eye at 2 m. \nEssentially, the brightness drops with the square of the distance. For example, a \n\n  Fig. 1.35.    A diffuse re fl ector re fl ects light in many directions, and as a result, the light intensity drops rapidly with distance (Credit: Richard \nSchmude, Jr.).       \n\n  Fig. 1.36.    The amount of light passing through one square at a distance of 1 m equals the amount of light passing through four equal squares \nat a distance of 2 m. This is why a lamp is four times brighter at a distance of 1 m than at 2 m (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n29\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n B\na\nsi\n\ncs\n\nsatellite 300 km away would appear four times brighter than if it is 600 km away. \nTherefore, as a satellite moves gracefully across the sky, its brightness will rise or \nfall because of its changing distance. \n\n Specular re fl ection is different. Examine Fig.  1.37 . Essentially, light is re fl ected in \na speci fi c direction instead of in many directions. One observes this mode of \nre fl ection with a mirror re fl ecting sunlight in a shaded area. Specular re fl ection is \ncommon. For example, the sand on a beach sparkles because the grains are ori-\nented in such a way that light is re fl ected straight back to the observer. Most objects \nre fl ect light close to the diffuse or specular modes. An 11 cm mirror purchased for \n$2 re fl ects a bright patch of sunlight 27 m (90 ft) away. The bright patch has an area \nabout six times larger than the mirror. Essentially, the light gradually spreads out \nat a small angle. See Fig.  1.38 .   \n\n In the case of perfect specular re fl ection, the light is re fl ected back and the beam \ndoes not spread out. In the case of the mirror, the re fl ected beam of light spreads \nout gradually. The beam spreads because there are mirror imperfections and also \nbecause of scattering caused by air and suspended particles. Therefore, for a given \namount of re fl ected light, the intensity does not drop with increasing distance for \nperfect specular re fl ection; it drops a little for nearly specular re fl ection and it \ndrops rapidly for diffuse re fl ection. \n\n Most satellites re fl ect diffusely. One exception is the  Iridium  satellite. It becomes \nbright because the mirror-like components are oriented just right. When this \noccurs, specular re fl ection takes place.  Iridium  satellites are discussed further in \nChap.   4    . \n\n The size of a satellite also affects its brightness. A large satellite usually \nre fl ects more light than a smaller one. The cross-sectional areas of satellites \nrange from over 1,000 m 2  for the ISS to less than 1.0 m 2  for smaller ones. If all \nother factors are equal, the ISS would be over 1,000 times brighter than the \nsmaller satellite. \n\n In many cases, a satellite may grow bright and dim periodically because it is \ntumbling and different cross-sectional areas are facing the observer. See Fig.  1.39 .   \n\n  Fig. 1.37.    Diffuse ( left ) and specular re fl ectors ( right ). The specular re fl ector will appear much brighter than the diffuse one. This is because \nthe diffuse re fl ector spreads out the re fl ected light, but the specular re fl ector does not spread out the light (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n  Fig. 1.38.    The nearly specular re fl ection of the 11 cm mirror mentioned in the text is illustrated. Since the light spreads out a little, it grows \na little dimmer with increasing distance (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_4\n\n\n30\n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n B\na\nsi\n\ncs\n\n   Satellite Applications \n Satellites today are used in a wide variety of ways.

The former USSR launched it on the second anniversary of \n Sputnik 1.  Since 1959, the United States, the former USSR, Japan, China, India and \nthe European Space Agency have launched spacecraft beyond Earth\u2019s orbit. The \nmain objective of these has been to gather scienti fi c data. Some have enabled \nastronomers to better understand our Sun and how it heats Earth, while others have \ngiven us a better understanding of the processes at work on other planets. In this \nchapter, we will give an overview of the different types of spacecraft missions. \nAfterwards, we will describe seven speci fi c spacecraft in detail. These seven and the \ncountries/agencies that launched them are:  Chang\u2019e-1  (China),  Chandrayaan-1  \n(India),  Hayabusa  (Japan), Hubble Space Telescope (United States),  Cassini  (United \nStates and the European Space Agency),  Spektr-R  (Russia) and  Gaia  (European \nSpace Agency).  \n\n   Spacecraft Missions \n Table  2.1  lists the advantages and disadvantages of the  fl yby, rendezvous, orbiter, \nlander, sample return and human missions. Each of these will be described.  \n\n Figure  2.1  illustrates a  fl yby mission. Essentially, a spacecraft  fl ies by its target \nand moves away. It does not orbit because it is moving too fast to be captured. In \nthis mission, the spacecraft is close to its target for only a few days. For example, \n Voyager 2  was only able to record useful images of the planet Uranus for about a \nweek during its January 1986  fl yby.  \n\n In many cases, a spacecraft will  fl y past a target of interest along the way to its des-\ntination. For example,  New Horizons   fl ew past Jupiter and its moons in 2007. It took \nclose-up images and carried out measurements during this encounter. See Fig.  2.2 .  \n\n Table  2.2  lists a few recent and planned  fl yby missions. In at least one case, an \nunplanned  fl yby took place. On January 23, 2000, Cassini happened to pass asteroid \n2685 (Masursky). It was able to image that object at low resolution.  \n\nR.

In a  fl yby mission, a spacecraft  fl ies near its target and then moves away. Note that the target\u2019s gravity alters the trajectory (Credit: \nRichard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n In the rendezvous mission, a spacecraft approaches its target but does not orbit \nit. In this case, the target has such a weak gravitational pull that it would be dif fi cult \nto adjust the velocity to initiate capture. This mission is illustrated in Fig.  2.3 .  \n\n Japan\u2019s  Hayabusa  spacecraft carried out a rendezvous mission. It traveled alongside \nof asteroid 25143 Itokawa.

Essentially, a \nspacecraft orbits its target. This mission is usually more expensive than a  fl yby one \nfor two reasons. Firstly, an orbiter requires a rocket with fuel. This is extra weight \nand, hence, more expensive to launch. Secondly, an orbiter mission lasts longer \nand, hence, costs are higher. \n\n In a few cases, an orbiting spacecraft will carry additional fuel so that engineers \nmay change its orbit. For example, the  Cassini  spacecraft made numerous close \n fl ybys of Saturn\u2019s moons. These maneuvers required extra rocket burns. Every time \n Cassini  approached a moon, its orbit changed. \n\n \n\n\n\n34\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n A lander mission is one where a spacecraft studies the dense portions of a body\u2019s \natmosphere and/or lands on its surface. Some spacecraft crash land. Others have a \nsoft landing. A rover is a special kind of lander. It moves along the surface. Several \nlander missions are outlined in Table  2.3 .  \n\n Since the 1990s, scientists have intentionally crashed objects into the Moon. In \na number of cases, their goal was to detect water in the debris kicked up by the \ncrashes. Table  2.4  lists a few deliberate lunar impacts. The objective of the  Lunar \nCrater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS)  mission was to crash two large \nobjects into the Moon and image the debris cloud. The mission was successful. \nBeatty  (  2010a  )  reports that one group of astronomers detected signi fi cant amounts \nof water in the debris cloud.  \n\n The former USSR carried out the  fi rst robotic sample return mission,  Luna 16,  \nin September 1970. It landed in the Moon\u2019s Sea of Fertility and scooped up a sam-\nple of regolith, then blasted off back to Earth. The Soviet  Luna 20  (February 1972) \nand  Luna 24  (August 1976) spacecraft collected additional Moon samples. Since \nthe 1970s, the Japanese and Americans have carried out successful sample return \nmissions. Table  2.5  lists the successful sample return missions as of early 2011. The \ntwo American sample return missions ( Genesis  and  Stardust ) entailed spacecraft \nthat collected particles in space. Neither spacecraft landed on its target.  Hayabusa  \nwas different. A small lander from  Hayabusa  landed but malfunctioned. In spite of \nthis, it collected dust near its target.  \n\n The manned mission entails considerable cost because a life support system is \nrequired. A human being needs a pressurized environment to survive. On Earth, \nthe atmosphere exerts enough pressure to sustain human life. In space gas must be \nbrought along. Astronauts also need air, food, water and various facilities. This \nmaterial must be brought along. \n\n The missions just described entail spacecraft that become satellites. These will \norbit a planet, an asteroid, the Moon, the Sun or the galaxy center. Five spacecraft \nare heading out of our Solar System. These are  Pioneer 10  and  11, Voyager 1  and  2  \nand  New Horizons.  Eventually, they will probably end up orbiting the galaxy \ncenter. \n\n Several dozen spacecraft were launched between 2000 and 2010. Some of these \nare designed to study one aspect of space and others are designed to study several \nobjects. These can be divided into six categories based on their target: (1) the Sun, \n(2) the Moon, (3) Mars, (4) other Solar System objects besides the Sun, the Moon \n\n  Fig. 2.3.    In the rendezvous mission, a spacecraft approaches (or gains) on its target until it is close enough to make measurements. At this \npoint, it moves with the target, as is shown at the bottom (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n35\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n   Table 2.3.

A sixth category, space \ntelescopes, study many targets. Characteristics and the home pages for these space-\ncraft are summarized in Tables  2.6 ,  2.7 ,  2.8 ,  2.9 ,  2.10 , and  2.11 .       \n\n Our atmosphere distorts images and is opaque to many wavelengths. Since the \nnineteenth century, astronomers have built observatories on mountains to mini-\nmize the degradation caused by our atmosphere. More recently, they have placed \ntelescopes in outer space. These have produced high-resolution images. \nFurthermore, space telescopes detect X-ray, ultraviolet and far-infrared wave-\nlengths that our atmosphere blocks. Therefore, they allow astronomers to use a \nvariety of wavelengths in their studies. Figure  2.4  shows the frequencies at which a \nfew of these telescopes operate, and Fig.  2.5  shows their mirror sizes.    \n\n   Chang\u2019e \u2013 1 \n Chinese engineers launched their  fi rst Moon satellite,  Chang\u2019e-1,  on October 24, \n2007, using a Long March 3A (or Chang Zheng 3A) rocket. They launched it from \nXiching spaceport. The satellite initially orbited Earth. It followed an elliptical-\ntransfer orbit (ETO), which stretched out. With planned rocket burns, engineers \nwere able to push it into the Moon\u2019s gravitational  fi eld. About 2 weeks after launch, \n Chang\u2019e \u2013 1  was in a nearly circular orbit around the Moon. It was about 200 km \nabove the lunar surface and orbited once every 2.1 h. Therefore, the Moon rotated \n1.16\u00b0 for each trip. This equals a shift of 35 km at the equator. \n\n This mission lasted about 16 months. Once  Chang\u2019e-1  completed its mission, it \ncrash landed on the Moon. \n\n The major scienti fi c objectives of  Chang\u2019e-1  and relevant instruments are sum-\nmarized in Table  2.12 . Figure  2.6  shows instruments and their frequency ranges. \nMost of the information in this section is from McDowell  (  2006e,   2008a  ) , Huixian \net al.  (  2005  ) , and Zhi-Jian et al.  (  2005  )  and the website   http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/\nnmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2007-051A    .   \n\n The  Chang\u2019e \u2013 1  orbiter had an initial mass of a large automobile. Solar arrays \nprovided power for it. It contained a stereo camera, a spectrometer imager, a laser \naltimeter, a microwave radiometer, a particle detector, and spectrometers that \ndetected X-rays and gamma rays. We will now describe these instruments. \n\n   Table 2.5.

Frequency ranges for different instruments on  Chang\u2019e-1.  Data are from the sources listed in the text (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n   Stereo Camera \n\n The stereo camera resolved lunar features as small as 120 m across. Images were \n60 km wide. It took three images at once, which were in the forward, nadir and \nbackward positions. See Fig.  2.7 . This camera allowed scientists to map the lunar \nsurface and to gain information on the Moon\u2019s topography.  \n\n Chinese scientists constructed a map of the lunar surface from  Chang\u2019e-1  \nimages. It has a resolution of about 120 m.  \n\n   Spectrometer Imager \n\n This instrument covered visible and near-infrared wavelengths. It imaged a \n25.6 km area. Its spatial resolution was 200 m. This is about the size of a city block. \nScientists plan to use the data to look for different minerals on the Moon.  \n\n   Laser Altimeter \n\n The  Chang\u2019e-1  orbiter had a laser altimeter. It sent pulses of near-infrared radia-\ntion with a wavelength of 1,064 nm. The pulses bounced off the lunar surface and \nreached a detector. This instrument collected topographic data. Chinese scientists \nobtained a topographical resolution of one meter from it.  \n\n   Microwave Radiometer \n\n The microwave radiometer served as both a microwave source and detector. It \nemitted microwaves (or short radio waves) with frequencies (in gigahertz \u2013 GHz) \nof 3, 7.8, 19.35 and 37. The respective wavelengths are 10, 3.8, 1.55 and 0.81 cm. The \ngoal of this instrument was to collect data on the thickness and temperature of the \nlunar regolith. \n\n \n\n\n\n45\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n What cools off quicker after a hot day \u2013 a concrete sidewalk or dry beach sand? \nThe beach sand cools off quicker. This is because small particles cool off faster \nthan large ones. This also happens on the lunar surface. As rocks and other mate-\nrial rotate into daylight, they heat up, and as they rotate into night they cool off. \nFigure  2.8  shows a cross-section view of the Moon\u2019s surface. The top layer, called \nthe regolith, is composed of dust and rock fragments. Most of the regolith frag-\nments are not chemically bonded to one other. The underlying bedrock is com-\nposed of large areas of solid rock. Regolith, composed of loose dust, cools off \nquickly after sunset. Bedrock at the surface, however, cools off slowly. Therefore, \nthe microwave radiometer data should enable scientists to determine where the \nexposed bedrock is and the depth of loose regolith.   \n\n   Gamma and X-ray Spectrometer \n\n The lunar surface emits gamma and X-ray radiation. Naturally, radioactive ele-\nments emit some of this radiation. Other elements, which are normally not radio-\nactive, emit this radiation when struck with cosmic rays. See Fig.  2.9 .  \n\n The purpose of the gamma ray and X-ray spectrometer is to yield information \non the composition of the lunar surface and solar wind. It should also yield infor-\nmation on the distribution of uranium and other radioactive elements. How does \nit do this? Different elements emit different wavelengths of gamma and X-ray radia-\ntion. Emission occurs as a result of spontaneous emission by radioactive elements. \n\n  Fig. 2.7.    The Stereo Camera on  Chang\u2019e-1  recorded three images at once in the forward, nadir and backward directions. The center of the nadir \nimage was 17\u00b0 from the centers of the forward and backward images (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n  Fig. 2.8.    The lunar surface contains either regolith or bedrock. The regolith is a mixture of rock fragments and loose dust. The regolith may be \npredominantly rock fragments ( far left ) or loose dust ( center ). As the surface cools down, the loose dust will cool off the fastest, and the bedrock will \ncool off the slowest (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n46\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\nIt may also happen as a result of cosmic rays. Essentially, a cosmic ray hits the \nsurface. An atom then emits speci fi c wavelengths that are unique to the element. \nScientists match the wavelengths given off with those given off by speci fi c elements. \nIn this way, they determine which elements are on the lunar surface.  \n\n   Particle Detector \n\n The particle detector measures the amount of protons and other subatomic parti-\ncles with kinetic energies of between 4 and 400 MeV. It also detects other nuclei at \nsimilar energies. A 40 MeV is moving at about one third the speed of light. \nTherefore, the particle detector detects particles moving at very high speeds. Its \npurpose is to study the environment between Earth and the Moon. This informa-\ntion is needed to insure the safety of astronauts traveling to the Moon.   \n\n   Chandrayaan \u2013 1 \n India launched  Chandrayaan-1  on October 22, 2008, using a Polar Satellite Launch \nVehicle (PSLV) rocket. It reached an elliptical transfer orbit like the one  Chang\u2019e-1  \nfollowed. After repeated burns it left Earth\u2019s orbit and settled into a nearly circular \nlunar polar orbit. During the  fi rst 7 months of the mission, it traveled 100 km above \nthe lunar surface. It moved at a speed of just over 2,900 km/hr and completed one \norbit in 118 min. Every time  Chandrayaan-1  completed an orbit, the Moon rotated \n1.08\u00b0. Therefore, the ground trace shifted 32.6 km at the equator. As a result this \norbiter imaged nearly the entire lunar surface. On May 19 2009, Indian engineers \nraised the orbit to an altitude of 200 km. This enabled the instruments to study \nlarger portions of the Moon. The Indian Deep Space Network (Indian DSN) facility \nnear Bangalore was responsible for communication. Most of the information about \nthe  Chandrayaan-1  orbiter is from Bhandari  (  2005  ) , Krishna et al.  (  2005  ) , Kumar \nand Chowdhury  (  2005a,   b  ) , Kamalakar et al.  (  2005  ) , Goswami et al.  (  2005  ) , Bhardwaj \net al.  (  2005  ) , Foing et al.  (  2005  ) , from the  Chandrayaan-1  homepage,   http://www.\nisro.org/chandrayaan/htmls/Home.htm     and from the online version of  The Hindu  \n(India\u2019s national newspaper). \n\n This satellite used solar arrays for power. They produced about 750 W of power. \nMuch of this was stored in rechargeable lithium ion batteries. These were needed \nwhen the Moon blocked the Sun. \n\n  Fig. 2.9.    When a cosmic ray strikes the Moon\u2019s surface, gamma- and X-rays are given off. The speci fi c wavelength depends on the element \nbeing struck (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\nhttp://www.isro.org/chandrayaan/htmls/Home.htm\nhttp://www.isro.org/chandrayaan/htmls/Home.htm\n\n\n47\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n Indian engineers built and designed most of the instruments on  Chandrayaan-1 . \nIt carried out studies of the Moon, the solar wind and the solar wind\u2019s impact on \nthe lunar environment. Figure  2.10  shows the frequency ranges which different \ninstruments on  Chandrayaan-1  measured. Table  2.13  summarizes several instru-\nments on board and their purpose. Let\u2019s examine some of these.   \n\n   Terrain Mapping Camera (TMC) \n\n The TMC imaged three regions of the Moon at once. Each was around 25\u00b0 from \nthe other. See Fig.  2.11 . Scientists designed this camera to produce stereoscopic \nimages. The camera\u2019s resolution was 10 arc-seconds. At an altitude of 100 km, this \nequals 5 m \u2013 about the size of a two-car garage. It also measured the heights of \nlunar features to an accuracy of 10 m \u2013 the height of a three-story apartment \nbuilding.  \n\n One goal of the TMC team was to produce maps of the Moon\u2019s polar regions. The \nbiggest problem was that very little light falls there. In essence, these areas are very \ndark. Astronomers reduced the problem of low-light levels by using the technique \nof pixel binning. Essentially, resolution was sacri fi ced to enhance sensitivity. With \nincreased sensitivity they were able to image darker areas. \n\n The TMC recorded about 70,000 images. One image set shows the 30 km crater \nDe Roy in the forward (fore), nadir and backward (aft) positions. The shadows are \ndifferent in these positions. Different viewing angles cause this. Indian astrono-\nmers constructed maps of most of the north and south polar regions of the Moon \nfrom TMC images. Over 80% of the areas south of 85\u00b0S and north of 85\u00b0N are in \nthese maps. These are displayed on the website   http://www.isro.org/Chandrayaan/\nhtmls/Home.htm    .  \n\n  Fig. 2.10.    Frequency ranges for different instruments on  Chandrayaan-1.

It used 64 different  fi lters. With this instrument, astrono-\nmers collected both images and spectra. \n\n Astronomers have released some results from the HySI. This instrument \nrecorded 64 images of the 5-km crater Barrow H with each  fi lter. The images show \ndifferent colored materials on the inner crater wall. They also show tiny craters \n\n   Table 2.13.

The \ncenter of the nadir image was 25\u00b0 from the centers of the forward and backward images (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n49\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\ninside Barrow H. Some of these are only around 60 m across. This instrument also \nrecorded images of the Moon\u2019s polar regions. Astronomers constructed color maps \nwith these. Several images are displayed on the website   http://www.isro.org/\nChandrayaan/htmls/Home.htm    .  \n\n   Near Infrared Spectrometer (SIR-2) \n\n The SIR-2 collected infrared spectra over the wavelength range 900\u20132,400 nm. It \nhad a  fi eld-of-view of 0.127\u00b0. At an altitude of 100 km, this is equivalent to \n220 m \u2013 about the size of a city block. The spectral resolution was 6 nm. \n\n Data from this instrument should allow astronomers to distinguish between \nsurfaces that contain mostly pyroxenes and those that contain mostly olivines. \nPyroxene and olivine are two different minerals. Data from SIR-2 should yield \ninformation on the bright rays of Copernicus and Tycho.  \n\n   Moon Mineral Mapper (M 3 ) \n\n The M 3  instrument was a NASA supported guest instrument on  Chandrayaan-1.  \nEssentially, light entered a telescope, which focused it onto a spectroscope. A detec-\ntor recorded the spectrum. This instrument covered wavelengths between 0.42 and \n3.0  microns . Data from M 3  should enable astronomers to record spectra of differ-\nent areas on the Moon. \n\n In September 2009, NASA of fi cials announced that the M 3  instrument detected \ntrace quantities of water on the daylight side of the Moon (Sky    and Telescope \n2010a). See Figs.  2.12  and  2.13 . According to one study, this water may come from \nhigh-energy protons, or hydrogen ions, which react with oxygen on the lunar sur-\nface. The trace amounts of water on the Moon may serve as an important resource \nfor the occupants of a future Moon base.    \n\n   Laser Altimeter (LLRI) \n\n The purpose of the LLRI was to collect lunar topographical data. This was accom-\nplished with a pulsed Nd-Yag laser. The wavelength was 1,064 nm. It sent short \npulses every 0.1 s, which bounced off the Moon and back to the orbiter. Through \ncareful measurement of the time that it took the light to leave and come back, sci-\nentists determined the distance to the ground. See Fig.  2.14 . This instrument \nyielded altitudes to an accuracy of about 5 m.  \n\n This instrument also collected data on the Moon\u2019s interior. Essentially, the \nMoon\u2019s gravitational  fi eld is not uniform. It is stronger in some areas. Areas of \nstronger gravity are called mascons. A high concentration of iron or other dense \nsubstances may lead to a mascon. The LLRI yielded information on lunar mascons. \nBy studying the small changes in lunar gravity, astronomers may learn more about \nthe Moon\u2019s crust and interior. \n\n According to the website   http://www.isro.org/Chandrayaan    , Indian astronomers \nhave constructed an accurate map of Clavius Crater using LLRI data. It shows \nseveral hills on the crater  fl oor. Astronomers have also constructed detailed topo-\ngraphical maps of the craters Bailly, Stebbins and Van\u2019t Hoff from LLRI data.  \n\nhttp://www.isro.org/Chandrayaan/htmls/Home.htm\nhttp://www.isro.org/Chandrayaan/htmls/Home.htm\nhttp://www.isro.org/Chandrayaan\n\n\n50\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n  Fig. 2.12.    Scientists assembled this mosaic of the Moon. They used images from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper on the  Chandrayaan-1  orbiter \nto make it.  Blue  areas indicate the presence of water.  Red  areas indicate the presence of the iron-bearing mineral pyroxene (Credit: ISRO/NASA/JPL-\nCaltech/Brown Univ./USGS).       \n\n   High Energy X-ray Spectrometer (HEX) \n\n The major goal of the HEX instrument is to search for evidence of volatile trans-\nport on the Moon. See Table  2.13 . Here is how it works. Radon ( 222 Rn) is radioac-\ntive. It is normally a gas, but at very cold temperatures, it condenses into a solid. \nTherefore, when  222 Rn is released from the ground some of it may move along the \nlunar surface and end up freezing at the poles. If radon moves along the surface \nvolatile transport would take place. The half-life of  222 Rn is 3.8 days, and hence, \nmuch of it decays quickly to other isotopes and ends up as the radioactive isotope \nlead ? ( 210 Pb). If  222 Rn moves along the Moon\u2019s surface large amounts of  210 Pb \nshould accumulate in the cold polar regions. If, on the other hand,  222 Rn does not \nmove along the surface (no volatile transport) the Moon\u2019s polar region would not \nhave a large amount of  210 Pb. See Fig.  2.15 .   \n\n   Sub-keV Atom Re fl ecting Analyzer (SARA) \n\n The SARA instrument detected neutral atoms and molecules escaping from the \nMoon. It also detected ions. A neutral atom has a net electrical charge of zero, \nwhereas an ion has a net positive or negative charge. Essentially, SARA was a neu-\ntral atom mass spectrometer. \n\n How does SARA yield information on the Moon\u2019s surface? As it turns out nature \nhelps. A stream of fast-moving charged particles bombards the Moon\u2019s surface. \nSome of these strike the surface and cause neutral atoms to be torn from their \n\n \n\n\n\n51\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n  Fig. 2.13.

The spectra are shown on the  right . The spectra are consistent with the presence of water in areas a-f (Credit: \nISRO/NASA/JPL-Caltech/Brown Univ.).       \n\n  Fig. 2.14.    The Laser Altimeter emits a pulse of radiation to the lunar surface. The pulse is then re fl ected back to  Chandrayaan-1.  By timing the \npulse, astronomers are able to measure the distance between the orbiter and the lunar surface to an accuracy of 5 m (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n52\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n  Fig. 2.15.    Each dot represents  222 Rn (radon) and  210 Pb (lead) radioisotopes. If  222 Rn (radon) moves along the lunar surface, as in the  left  \nframe, it would accumulate near the poles because of the low temperatures. At the poles, the  222 Rn will turn into  210 Pb. If  222 Rn does not move along \nthe surface, there would be no accumulation of  210 Pb at the poles, as is shown on the  right . This is discussed further in Goswami et al.  (  2005  )  (Credit: \nRichard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n  Fig. 2.16.    A fast moving solar wind particle, like a proton, strikes the lunar surface. A neutral atom is released. A neutral atom is one that has \nthe same number of protons and electrons. The Sub-keV Atom Re fl ecting Analyzer (SARA) on  Chandrayaan-1  detects neutral atoms. Their composition \nwill give astronomers new insights concerning the elements on the lunar surface (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\ncrystal lattices and ejected. This is called sputtering. See Fig.  2.16 . As a result of this, \nSARA was able to detect the escaping atoms. This allowed scientists to gain insights \ninto the composition of the lunar surface.  \n\n A second objective of the SARA instrument was to characterize magnetic \nanomalies on the lunar surface. The Moon does not have a large magnetic  fi eld, like \nEarth, but it has weak  fi elds that cover parts of its surface. These have strengths of \nup to about 0.05 Gauss. This is strong enough to prevent sputtering. Therefore, a \ndrop in intensity of silicon atoms is evidence for a local magnetic  fi eld. See \nFig.  2.17 .   \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n53\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n  Fig. 2.17.    Solar wind particles will generate a thin layer of silicon atoms far above the lunar surface. If a local magnetic  fi eld is present, \nhowever, most of the solar wind particles would not reach the surface. This will create a drop in the number of silicon atoms above the magnetic  fi eld. \nThis information is based on Bhardwaj et al.  (  2005  )  (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n   Chandrayaan-1 X-ray Spectrometer (C1XS) \n\n The C1XS instrument package contained two instruments: an X-ray  fl uorescence \nspectrometer (LEX) and an X-ray solar monitor (XSM). The LEX instrument was \ndesigned to measure X-rays coming from the Moon\u2019s surface, and the XSM was \ndesigned to monitor X-rays coming from our Sun. The solar X-rays are needed for \ndata calibration. The LEX instrument had a  fi eld-of-view of 14\u00b0. At an altitude of \n100 km, this equals 25 km. \n\n How did the C1XS measure element abundances? Essentially, it used X-ray \n fl uorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence is a process whereby radiation strikes a \nsurface and less energetic radiation is emitted. In the case of the Moon, energetic \nradiation strikes the lunar surface. This causes electrons in the inner shells of \natoms to shift positions. When this occurs X-rays are given off. Each element gives \noff speci fi c wavelengths. For example, the elements silicon, aluminum, magnesium, \ncalcium and iron give off X-rays with wavelengths (in nm) of 0.674, 0.795, 0.950, \n0.307 and 0.174, respectively. (The wavelengths are computed from the energies \nlisted in Lide  (  2008  ) , p. 224). Therefore, if the C1XS detects lots of X-rays with a \nwavelength of 0.674 nm, silicon should be present. \n\n Narendranath et al.  (  2011  )  used C1XS data to measure the soil composition in \n fi ve spots on the Moon. They were near 29\u00b0S, 8.5\u00b0W. The average element abun-\ndances are: silicon (19%), aluminum (17%), calcium (8%), iron (7%) and magne-\nsium (5%). Other elements make up the remaining 44%.  \n\n   Miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar (miniSAR) \n\n The miniSAR had an advantage over many of the other instruments on \n Chandrayaan-1.  It did not require sunlight. Because of this, it collected data on \nthe polar regions, which are in permanent darkness. Many astronomers believe \nthat water ice is present in these areas because they do not heat up. This is how \nthe miniSAR worked. It sent out radio waves with a frequency of 2.4 GHz. These \ninteracted with the surface and bounced back to the orbiter. Many substances, \nincluding water ice, interacted with them in speci fi c ways. Astronomers used \nminiSAR data to search for water ice.  \n\n \n\n\n\n54\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n   Moon Impact Probe (MIP) \n\n The MIP was a 34 kg package released soon after  Chandrayaan-1  began orbiting \nthe Moon. As it fell, it spun and, as a result, was \u201cspin stabilized.\u201d Small forces were \nunable to cause it to tumble. In essence, scientists knew the spin rate at all times. It \ncollected data as it fell.  \n\n   Summary of Chandrayaan-1 \n\n All eleven instrument packages functioned well during the mission. This satellite \naccomplished almost all of its objectives. It was the  fi rst satellite Indian engineers \nlaunched to the Moon. India joins a small group of countries that have placed its \n fl ag on the Moon. Unfortunately, the satellite started having dif fi culties in the \nspring of 2009 when one of its star sensors malfunctioned. A few months later the \nmission ended. Indian scientists are already working on a next generation lunar \norbiter and lander \u2013  Chandrayaan-2.  They are also analyzing data from \n Chandrayaan-1  and have begun publishing their  fi ndings.   \n\n   Hayabusa \n Japanese engineers launched  Hayabusa  in May 2003, and it arrived at Asteroid \n25143 Itokawa in September 2005. For the next 2 months it took images and \nrecorded surface data. In November, the tiny lander, Minerva, separated from \n Hayabusa  and made its slow descent to the surface. During this time, it collected \nmicroscopic dust grains. After several technical problems, scientists guided the \nreturn capsule back to Earth. It arrived in June 2010 in the Australian outback. The \ninstruments on  Hayabusa  are summarized in Table  2.14 . Figure  2.18  shows the \nfrequency range that different instruments measured.   \n\n  Hayabusa  recorded images of all parts of Itokawa. These allowed scientists to \nmeasure its size, volume and surface area. Fujiwara et al.  (  2006  )  used the slight \ngravitational tugs of Itokawa to measure its mass. With the mass and volume they \ncomputed a density of     31920 130 kg/m\u00b1   . This is about twice that of water but is \nonly about 60% of the minerals making up the surface. Abe et al.  (  2006a  )  conclude \nthat Itokawa has a porosity of 40%. This means that about 40% of this asteroid is \nempty space. Essentially, Itokawa is a rubble pile instead of a solid object. Over 500 \nboulders cover Itokawa\u2019s surface. Saito et al.  (  2006  )  measured their sizes. They \nfound that the ratio of 20-, 10- and 5-m boulders is 1\u20138 to 500. A few characteristics \nof Itokawa are summarized in Table  2.15 .  \n\n  Hayabusa  collected dust from Itokawa. This enabled scientists to carry out tests. \nTsuchiyama et al.  (  2011  )  used a technique called microtomography to examine \ndust particles. They report grain sizes of up to 0.2 mm. Small grains are more \nabundant than larger ones over the 20\u2013100 micron range. They report that the ratio \nof 80, 40 and 20 micron particles is 1 to 4 to 16. This group also reports a mean \nshape for several grains. The three dimensions are shown in Fig.  2.19 . The shortest \none, c, is 0.43 times the longest one, a. The intermediate dimension, b, is 0.71 times \nthe longest one. This group also reports a mean density of 3430 kg/m 3  for dust \n\n\n\n55\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n   Table 2.14.

If so, you probably noticed that the \nimage was a little blurry. Turbulence and air currents in our atmosphere cause this. \nFurthermore, our atmosphere acts as a weak prism. Essentially, it bends the colors \nof light in different directions. These factors degrade the image. It is for this reason \nthat astronomers began thinking about a space telescope before the space age. \n\n NASA and other organizations have launched several space telescopes covering \nmuch of the electromagnetic spectrum. See Table  2.6 . The most well known of \nthese is the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). One reason for this is that it operates at \nvisible wavelengths. This is the same light we see. According to the website (  http://\nspacetelescope.org/    ) as of July 2011 Hubble has made over 1 million observations. \nThe data that HST has collected has helped scientists publish 9,400 scienti fi c \n\n  Fig. 2.19.

Many of its original parts have been replaced with new ones. The \nfour HST servicing missions are summarized in Table  2.18 . The purpose of these \nwas to replace or repair broken equipment and to place the HST in a higher orbit. \nThe orbit change was needed because the telescope experiences small drag forces \nthat cause it to fall closer to Earth. Without the boost to a higher orbit, it would \nspiral back to Earth. Space shuttle astronauts carried out all of the servicing mis-\nsions. The Canadian-built robotic arm was also of great value in these missions. \nMuch of the material in this section is from the website   http://spacetelescope.org/    , \nand Petersen and Brandt  (  1998  ) .  \n\n The HST contains several features that enables it to function properly and to be \nrepaired easily. It contains a support structure that holds equipment in place. \nInstruments in this structure are arranged in a modular format. This insures that \nthey may be removed easily.

In addition to these items, six equipment systems on \nHubble are essential to its operation. These deal with optics, power generation/\nstorage, maneuverability and pointing, computer/data storage, communications \nand science. This equipment will be described here. \n\n   Optical System \n\n The HST contains a 2.4 m primary mirror and a 0.34 m secondary mirror. The \nprimary mirror has a focal length of 57.6 m and, hence, its focal ratio is f/24. It is \ncoated with aluminum, which is the same element that is on the mirrors of most \nNewtonians. On top of the aluminum is a protective layer of magnesium  fl uoride. \nThe optical system is of the Ritchey-Cr\u00e9tien type. Essentially, light comes into the \ntelescope and re fl ects off the primary mirror, which then moves to the secondary \nmirror. Light re fl ects off that and moves through the central hole in the primary \nmirror to the instruments. See Fig.  2.20 .  \n\n The mirror has one problem. It does not focus all of the light at the same point. \nThis is called chromatic aberration. This is the same problem that many inexpen-\nsive refractor telescopes have. The problem came about because the mirror was \nmanufactured to the wrong speci fi cations. Since engineers know the exact shape of \nthe mirror, they are able to make modi fi cations that correct the problem. \nFigures  2.21  and  2.22  show images of the planets Mars and Jupiter taken with the \nHST. The images show clearly that engineers have solved the problem.    \n\n   Power Generation/Storage System \n\n The HST has two solar arrays with a total area of 37 m 2 . They supply over 5 kW of \npower \u2013 enough to power a small home. The solar arrays charge the six nickel-\nhydrogen rechargeable batteries. These serve as a source of power. When the HST \nmoves into Earth\u2019s shadow, the arrays are not able to generate power. It is during \nthis time that stored energy becomes essential.  \n\n   Maneuverability and Pointing System \n\n As of late 2009, the HST had imaged over 29,000 targets without anyone pushing it. \nAstronomers were able to steer this instrument with reaction wheels. We will \n\n  Fig. 2.20.    Light enters the Hubble Space Telescope and then bounces off the primary mirror. This light then strikes the secondary mirror and \nmoves back through the hole in the primary mirror to the instruments.

Figure  2.23  shows a boy standing on a lazy Susan, a device \nthat can spin. Its rotational axis is perpendicular to the ground. The boy is holding \na spinning bicycle wheel so that its rotational axis is perpendicular to that of the \nlazy Susan. In this example, the boy and bicycle wheel are analogous to the HST \nand a reaction wheel, respectively.  \n\n The boy does not spin in Fig.  2.23a  because the rotational axis of the spinning \nwheel is perpendicular to that of the lazy Susan. Essentially, he does not spin \nbecause of how he is holding the wheel. When he turns the wheel as is shown in \nFig.  2.23b , he spins. He spins because of what is called the conservation of angular \nmomentum. Essentially, angular momentum is the product of the mass and angu-\nlar speed of a rotating object. In Fig.  2.23a , the total angular momentum around the \naxis of the lazy-Susan is zero. The total angular momentum in this case is the sum \nof the boy\u2019s angular momentum and that from the bicycle wheel. This is also the \ncase in Fig.  2.23b . In Fig.  2.23b , the wheel has a non-zero angular momentum with \nrespect to the axis of the Lazy Susan and, hence, the boy has an equal but opposite \nangular momentum to what he is holding. Therefore, the boy spins in the opposite \ndirection of the wheel. As a result, the sum of the angular momentum of the boy \nand the wheel equals zero. \n\n Now, when the boy  fl ips the wheel as is shown in Fig.  2.23c , he spins in the oppo-\nsite direction. The boy may also hold the wheel at a 45\u00b0 angle and he will spin but \nat a slower rate than in Fig.  2.23b  or  c . Therefore, the boy controls how fast he spins \nby how he holds the wheel. In a similar way, astronomers control HST with the \nreaction wheels. \n\n The HST must  fi nd two guide stars near its target before data collection com-\nmences. Once suitable stars are found, the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGSs) lock \nonto them. One of the tasks of the FGSs is to keep the HST pointed at its target. \n\n  Fig. 2.23.    A boy holds a spinning bicycle wheel and stands on a lazy Susan. Frame a: the boy does not spin because he holds the bicycle wheel \nin such a way that it does not affect his angular momentum around the rotational axis of the lazy Susan. Frame b: the boy spins in the opposite direc-\ntion in which the bicycle wheel spins because of the conservation of angular momentum. Frame c: once again, the boy spins in the opposite direction \nin which the bicycle wheel spins. Therefore, the boy controls the direction he spins by how he holds the wheel (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n61\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\nThe FGSs keep it pointed at the target to within 0.01 arc-seconds. This is one reason \nwhy HST images are sharp. A FGS unit is the size of a washing machine. \n\n Three rate sensor units (RSUs) are also in the HST. Each of these has two gyro-\nscopes. These spin at a rate of 19,200 rpm. The RSUs are needed to point the HST. \nNASA replaced all of the gyroscopes in the fourth servicing mission (SM4).  \n\n   Computer/Data Storage System \n\n The HST has a computer with ample memory to store data. Essentially, one instru-\nment collects data that is stored on the computer. Later, it is sent back to Earth. This \ncomputer also receives detailed instructions that cover all operations of the HST \nincluding pointing, calibration activities, the sequence of observations to be car-\nried out, and instructions for keeping the mirror pointed away from very bright \nobjects.  \n\n   Communications System \n\n The HST has two radio dishes that receive and transmit data. All data is transmit-\nted through radio signals. Data is generally transmitted from HST to one of sev-\neral of NASA\u2019s  Tracking and Data Relay Satellites.  These are in geostationary \norbits. They relay the data to White Sands, New Mexico. Afterwards, the data is \nsent to Goddard Space fl ight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, the Space Telescope \nScience Institute at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and  fi nally \nto the appropriate observer. The sequence of data transmission is shown in \nFig.  2.24 .   \n\n   Scienti fi c Instrument System \n\n The HST has several scienti fi c instruments. Five of these are the Advanced \nCamera for Surveys (ACS), Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), Near Infrared \nCamera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), Space Telescope Imaging \nSpectroscope (STIS) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC 3). In addition to these, \nthe Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) are often used as an instrument. Figure  2.25  \nshows the frequency range for HST\u2019s instruments. We will describe each of these, \nbut before this, we will describe what a spectrum is and how astronomers use it.  \n\n A spectrum shows a pattern of light that is the result of a substance interacting \nwith light. Two types of spectra are called absorption and emission spectra. They \nare often presented as graphs of light intensity versus wavelength. Figure  2.26  \n\n  Fig. 2.24.

An absorption ( top ) and emission ( bottom ) spectrum of hydrogen in visible light (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\nshows an emission and an absorption spectrum of hydrogen. In the emission \nspectrum the light intensity is near zero except for three speci fi c wavelengths. The \nvisible light hydrogen emits corresponds to the three emission peaks. The hydrogen \nabsorption spectrum has intensity minima at the wavelengths in Fig.  2.26 . \nAbsorption causes the minima. Under certain conditions, hydrogen emits light, \nand under others, it absorbs light.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n63\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n  Fig. 2.27.    Absorption spectra of hydrogen, helium and sodium. Note that each of these elements absorbs different wavelengths of light (Credit: \nRichard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n Each element, ion and compound produces its own unique spectrum. See \nFig.  2.27 . Because of this, one may identify an element in a distant object by looking \nat its spectrum. For example, when the pattern of emission (or absorption) lines \nmatches up with that of hydrogen, it means that this element is present. See \nFig.  2.28 . Astronomers can use spectra to identify elements, ions and compounds. \nTable  2.19  summarizes some of the other information that astronomers may \nobtain from spectra.     \n\n   Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) \n\n The ACS images an object and records its spectrum. Essentially, it is two instru-\nments in one. This camera breaks up the light from a target into individual wave-\nlengths. It can also block out unwanted light. This is especially useful for studying \nplanetary satellites or a faint object near a bright star. The ACS also contains a \ndevice that blocks out unwanted visible light. In this way, astronomers are able to \nfocus just on the ultraviolet light. For example, it is an ideal instrument to study \nJupiter\u2019s aurora since it cuts out the visible light this planet re fl ects.  \n\n \n\n\n\n64\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n  Fig. 2.28.

Note that the three absorption features \nof hydrogen match up with those in the spectrum of the star ( dashed line ). This shows the star has hydrogen. The absorption features in the spectra of \nhelium and sodium do not match up with the star ( dotted lines ). Therefore, one may conclude that those elements are not in the star\u2019s spectrum (Credit: \nRichard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n   Table 2.19.    Information that may be obtained from spectra   \n\n Information  What we should do \n\n Identify an element, ion \nor compound \n\n Match up the target\u2019s spectrum with that of an element, ion or compound. A match means the element, ion or com-\npound is present \n\n Temperature measurement  Measure the intensity of light given off at different wavelengths; match up the intensities with a blackbody at differ-\nent temperatures. The one that matches the spectra best is the object\u2019s temperature \n\n Rotation rate of a star  Measure the width of an emission line. The wider the line, the faster the rotation \n Measure magnetic  fi eld \nstrength \n\n Measure small shifts in the positions of absorption (or emission) lines caused by nearby magnetic  fi elds. These \nshifts are the result of the Zeeman Effect. The magnitude of the shifts is used to measure the strength of the mag-\nnetic  fi eld \n\n Isotopic abundance  Measure the rotational transitions in high-resolution spectra. Isotopes will have different rotational spectra. The \nintensity of rotational transitions is used to determine isotopic abundances \n\n Radial velocity  Measure how far the absorption (or emission) lines shift. Use the Doppler shift equation to determine the radial \nvelocity \n\n Extrasolar planet or other \nunseen companion \n\n Record spectra over a period of months or years. Look for periodic shifts in the wavelength of absorption \n(or emission) lines. These shifts will reveal the period of revolution and the mass of the stellar companion in terms of \nthe star \n\n \n\n\n\n65\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n   Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) \n\n The COS collects spectra. It has two channels that are sensitive to different wave-\nlengths of ultraviolet light. One is sensitive to wavelengths between 115 and \n177 nm, and the other is sensitive to those between 175 and 300 nm. This instru-\nment is about the size of a hot water heater.  \n\n   Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer \n(NICMOS) \n\n The NICMOS records both images and spectra. It has a  fi eld-of-view of     52 52\u00b4    arc \nseconds \u2013 slightly smaller than the Ring Nebula. It detects objects as faint as 25th \nmagnitude. This is about 10,000 times fainter than Pluto. Unlike the other HST \ninstruments, the NICMOS detector is cooled to 80\u00b0K. This is needed to reduce \nnoise caused by heat. A large block of nitrogen ice serves as the coolant. Like the \nACS, this instrument is able to block out unwanted light.  \n\n   Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) \n\n As the name implies, STIS takes an image and records spectra. It may also record \nspectra of different parts of an extended object. For example, this instrument can \nrecord the spectra of the nucleus and the spiral arms of a galaxy. Like the ACS and \nNICMOS, STIS can block out unwanted light. This instrument has a  fi eld-of-view \nof     50 50\u00b4    arc seconds. It is able to detect objects as faint as magnitude 28.5. This \nis about the brightness of a 100-W light bulb at a distance of 8 million km. It has \nseveral different gratings. This allows the astronomer to choose the resolution and \nthe wavelengths of light to be included in the spectrum.  \n\n   Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC 3) \n\n The WFC 3 is about the size of an upright piano. It records an image at a speci fi c \nwavelength. This instrument has two channels that are sensitive to 200\u20131,000 nm \nand to 850\u20131700 nm. The  fi rst channel has a  fi eld-of-view of 160 arc seconds by 160 \narc seconds, which is about twice the size of the Ring Nebula (M57). The detector \nhas an array of 4,096 by 4,096 pixels. Therefore, each pixel has a resolution of 0.04 \narc seconds. This is one reason why HST images are sharp. The second channel has \na  fi eld-of-view that is about half that of the  fi rst one. It also has a lower resolution. \nLike the other scienti fi c instruments on the HST, the WFC 3 has optical compo-\nnents that correct for the spherical aberration of the primary mirror.  \n\n   Fine Guidance Sensors (FGSs) \n\n As mentioned earlier, the primary function of the FGSs is to keep the HST pointed \nat its target. A second function is to yield information on the positions of stars \n(astrometry). The HST Fine Guidance Sensors are able to yield more accurate star \npositions than those obtained from the ground because the atmosphere does not \nsmear out the images.   \n\n\n\n66\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n   Cassini \n NASA launched the  Cassini  Saturn orbiter on October 15, 1997 with a Titan \nCentaur rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. At launch, this spacecraft had a mass \nof 5650 kg \u2013 twice that of a large sport utility vehicle. It is named after the Italian \nastronomer Jean Dominique Cassini, who discovered four of Saturn\u2019s moons \n(Iapetus, Rhea, Dione and Tethys). It took this spacecraft almost 7 years to reach its \ndestination.  Cassini  fell into an orbit around Saturn on June 30, 2004. Along the \nway, it received gravity assists from Venus, Earth and Jupiter. This spacecraft also \npassed about 1.6 million km from asteroid 2685 (Masursky) on January 23, 2000. \nIt also imaged Jupiter. See Fig.  2.29 .  \n\n The main objective of  Cassini  is to collect data on Saturn, its rings and satellites. \nBecause of this, it continues to orbit that planet and make  fl ybys of the moons. The \nnecessary orbital changes are made with an onboard rocket. Starting in 2008, \nCassini started its extended mission. It may have enough power to last until 2015 \nor beyond. \n\n Three Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) supply power. These are \nneeded to operate the equipment and to maintain the proper temperature for each \ninstrument. Chapter   1     describes RTGs. \n\n  Fig. 2.29.

Astronomers then constructed a mosaic of Jupiter \nfrom these images, which is shown here (Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute).       \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_1\n\n\n67\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n  Cassini  has twelve scienti fi c instrument packages onboard along with the \nHuygens Titan Lander.

The light which the MT2  fi lter transmits is unable to penetrate through much of Saturn\u2019s atmosphere because of methane absorption. \nThe light that the CBT  fi lter transmits, however, is able to penetrate to low altitude clouds that are at the 0.5 atm. level. This is based on information \nin Porco et al.  (  2005a  )  (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n   Visual, Infrared and Ultraviolet Instruments \n\n Four  Cassini  instrument packages measure ultraviolet, visible and infrared wave-\nlengths. We\u2019ll describe relevant  fi ndings from each of these starting with the \nCassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS).  \n\n   Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) \n\n Have you ever noticed the stronger winds at the top of a mountain? Essentially, the \nwind speed changes at different altitudes. Saturn\u2019s atmosphere also has this char-\nacteristic. The Cassini Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) imaged clouds in both \nvisible and methane band light during 2004. Porco et al.  (  2005a  )  report peak wind \nspeeds on Saturn dropped from 450 m/s in 1980\u20131981 to 360 m/s in 2004. They \npoint out that the measured wind speeds depend on the altitude of the clouds. Let's \nsee how this works. \n\n The ISS contained several  fi lters. Two of them, with wavelengths of peak trans-\nmission in parentheses, are the CB2 (750 nm) and MT2 (727 nm)  fi lters. Since \nmethane absorbs light with a wavelength of 727 nm, the MT2  fi lter detects features \nat high altitudes. The light that the CB2  fi lter transmits, however, passes through \nthe methane. As a result, it detects features at lower altitudes. See Fig.  2.31 . During \n2004, the ISS imaged the same regions with both  fi lters. Features in the CB2  fi lter \nmoved 100 m/s faster than those imaged in the MT2  fi lter. Essentially, clouds at the \nlower altitude moved faster.  \n\n \n\n\n\n70\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n The ISS has also given us close-up images of Phoebe, one of Saturn\u2019s distant \nmoons. See Fig.  2.32 . Thanks to ISS images, we know that Phoebe\u2019s surface has a \nhigh concentration of craters and, hence, is very old. Phoebe\u2019s surface also has \ndifferent layers of material. Astronomers determined its average diameter to be \n    213 2 km\u00b1    and its average density to be     31630 45 kg / m\u00b1   .  \n\n We have also learned more about Saturn\u2019s Moon Iapetus from the ISS. Images \nshow a large ridge around it. See Fig.  2.33 . This feature stretches almost 120\u00b0 of \nlongitude. It lies near Iapetus\u2019s equator. The ridge rises as much as 20 km (or 12 \nmiles) above the surface. ISS images also show that the dark area on Iapetus \n(Cassini Regio) is heavily cratered and, hence, is very old.  \n\n The ISS also imaged Saturn\u2019s rings. Three goals of ISS ring studies were to meas-\nure the colors of individual ringlets, search for spokes and collect information on \nring dynamics. Porco et al.  (  2005a  )  used ISS images made in different wavelengths \nto measure ring colors. From these images, they concluded that the different colors \nare caused by varying amounts of contaminants. This group also reports that \nspokes were not present from February to June of 2004. This is consistent with \nthem being more common when the Sun-ring plane angle is below 15\u00b0. The ISS \nimages show a variety of ring phenomena, including density waves. Astronomers \nwere able to estimate the mass of Saturn\u2019s moons Atlas and Pan from density \nwaves. Although the ISS collected lots of valuable data, the Composite Infrared \nSpectrometer (CIRS) also collected important data. Before discussing the ISS, we \nwill explain altitudes on Saturn.  \n\n  Fig. 2.32.    The Imaging Science Subsystem ( narrow angle ) on  Cassini  recorded two images of Phoebe on June 11, 2004. Astronomers then \ncreated this mosaic from the images (Credit: NASA/JPL/Space Science Institute).       \n\n \n\n\n\n71\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n   Altitudes on Saturn \n\n On Earth, altitudes are expressed in terms of sea level. For example, the tallest \nmountain in the continental United States is Mount Whitney, which is 4,418 m \nabove sea level. Unlike Earth, Saturn lacks a solid or liquid surface. Therefore, \naltitudes are expressed in terms of pressure. The lower the pressure, the higher the \naltitude. For example, an area at the 0.01 atm. level is higher than one at the 1.0 atm. \nlevel. See Fig.  2.34 .   \n\n   Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) \n\n The Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) measured the composition and \ntemperature of Saturn\u2019s atmosphere. CIRS data show that its atmosphere contains \n0.5% methane. This instrument also measured the temperature at different alti-\ntudes. Between the 0.5 and 0.1 atm. level, the temperature falls with increasing \naltitude; this is the same trend that occurs in our troposphere. Above the 0.03 atm. \nlevel, it increases with altitude. See Fig.  2.34 . A similar trend occurs in our strato-\nsphere. The CIRS also measured the temperatures of Saturn\u2019s moon Phoebe. The \nrespective day and night temperatures are about 110 and about 75\u00b0K. \n\n How does the CIRS measure temperature? Before we answer this question, let us \nrecall what temperature is exactly. The temperature of an object is a measure of the \naverage kinetic energy of its atoms. The higher the energy, the higher the tempera-\nture. Or, in other words, the faster that atoms move, the higher the temperature. An \nobject at 288\u00b0K emits infrared wavelengths. If it behaves as a blackbody it should \ngive off more radiation at a wavelength of 10  m m than at other wavelengths. \n\n  Fig. 2.33.    An image of a large ridge on Iapetus. The wide-angle camera on  Cassini  took this image on September 10, 2007 (Credit: NASA/\nJPL/Space Science Institute).       \n\n \n\n\n\n72\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\nFigure  2.35  shows the intensity of radiation versus wavelength for blackbodies at \n80\u00b0K, 100\u00b0K and 120\u00b0K. These graphs have two differences. One is the relative \nintensity that increases with temperature. The second difference is the wavelength \nat maximum intensity. It is 24  m m at 120\u00b0K but is 36  m m at 80\u00b0K.  \n\n Blackbodies at different temperatures emit different amounts of infrared radiation. \nTherefore, one may measure temperature from emitted light. The CIRS measures \nthe intensity of infrared radiation at different wavelengths. Astronomers  fi t intensities \nto different blackbody temperature curves. Each temperature has a different curve. \nThe temperature that  fi ts the data best is the one selected. See Fig.  2.36 .  \n\n  Fig. 2.35.

This enabled one group (Guerlet et al. \n 2009  )  to measure the amount of acetylene (C 2 H 2 ), ethane (C 2 H 6 ) and propane \n(C 3 H 8 ) in Saturn\u2019s atmosphere. This group also discovered that the amount of pro-\npane increases as one approaches Saturn\u2019s south polar region. They also found an \nenhancement of C 2 H 2  and C 2 H 6  in the area of the ring shadow. Guerlet et al.  (  2010  )  \nreport that the amounts of diacetylene (C 4 H 2 ) and methylacetylene (CH 3 C 2 H) var-\nies with the latitude. The abundance of these gases also changes with altitude. \nThese results will serve as constraints for future models of atmospheric circula-\ntion. Like the ISS and CIRS, the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) also \ncarried out measurements that will be described.  \n\n   Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) \n\n When  Cassini  was 4 million km from Saturn, the UVIS recorded images of Saturn \nand the surrounding area. These were in the speci fi c wavelength of light that oxy-\ngen emits. Astronomers used the intensities to determine the amount of this gas in \nSaturn\u2019s magnetosphere. They discovered that it dropped a factor of two over a \n2-month period. Esposito et al.  (  2005b  )  suggest the rings and moons are sources of \noxygen. \n\n  Fig. 2.36.    In order to determine the temperature of a large body such as a planet, one should measure the intensities of emitted light at \nseveral different wavelengths. In this case, the intensities of mid-infrared light are shown as vertical bars. One then compares different blackbody curves \nat different temperatures until there is a  fi t. In this case, the curve at 100\u00b0K  fi t the data. The blackbody temperature is, therefore, 100\u00b0K. This author \nused equations from Atkins and de Paula  (  2002  )  to compute the blackbody curves (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n74\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n The ISS, CIRS and UVIS have all contributed to our understanding of the Saturn \nsystem, but the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) has helped us \nbetter understand the surface of Saturn\u2019s largest moon, Titan.  \n\n   Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) \n\n The VIMS is able to image Titan\u2019s surface. This is possible because its atmosphere \nis nearly transparent to some wavelengths. Therefore, all one has to do is record an \nimage at the appropriate wavelength and it will show Titan\u2019s surface. \n\n Images made by VIMS show Titan\u2019s sand dunes. Barnes et al.  (  2009  )  used images \nto estimate a dune spacing of 2.1 km. This group also reports dunes are oriented \nin a nearly east\u2013west direction. They report one dune is between 30 and 70 m tall. \nThese results are consistent with radar and ISS results. \n\n In addition to sand dunes, the VIMS helped us learn more about a lake on Titan. \nBrown et al.  (  2008  )  summarizes images and spectra of Ontario Lacus. This is a lake \nabout the size of Lake Ontario. Astronomers believe it is a body of liquid ethane \nmixed with other substances.  \n\n   Magnetometers \n\n The magnetic  fi eld of a planet (or moon) yields a wealth of information about the \ninterior. For example, the magnetometers on  Galileo  detected a magnetic  fi eld near \nJupiter\u2019s moon Europa (The Worlds of Galileo \u00a92001 by Michael Hanlon, p. 140.). \nFurthermore, the data showed that Europa\u2019s magnetic  fi eld changed in a short \nperiod of time. Some scientists believe this is evidence for a liquid ocean below \nEuropa\u2019s icy surface. Could one or more of Saturn\u2019s moons have a liquid ocean \nbelow its surface? Is Saturn\u2019s magnetic  fi eld changing direction? \n\n These and other questions are what motivated scientists to develop the magne-\ntometer assembly on  Cassini.  One problem with a magnetometer, though, is that \nelectrical equipment generates magnetic  fi elds. This is a problem since  Cassini  is \nchock full of electrical equipment. \n\n To overcome this problem, three courses of action were undertaken. First, the \nmagnetometers were placed on a long pole called a boom. Therefore, they are sev-\neral meters from the electrical equipment. Secondly, a special committee called the \nMagnetic Control Board was set up. It was made up of scientists and its purpose \nwas to insure that spacecraft-generated magnetic  fi elds did not interfere with mag-\nnetometer readings. Thirdly, scientists designed their instruments so they did not \nproduce magnetic  fi elds over the limit set by the Magnetic Control Board. The \nMagnetic Control Board wanted  Cassini\u2019s  magnetic  fi eld to be lower than 0.2 nT at \nthe outermost magnetometer. \n\n The magnetometers are able to measure both the strength and direction of the \nmagnetic  fi eld. They may also measure  fi elds stronger than 10,000 nanoTesla (nT) \nwith a resolution of about one nT. For a comparison, Earth\u2019s magnetic  fi eld at the \nsurface is between 30,000 and 60,000 nT. \n\n The magnetic  fi eld depends on Saturn\u2019s interior, the magnetosphere and interac-\ntions between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. The magnetometers made \nhundreds of measurements in 2004. Dougherty et al.  (  2005  )  report the strength and \norientation of Saturn\u2019s magnetic  fi eld did not change between 1981 and 2004. They \nreport, however, the magnetosphere-generated  fi eld changed during this time.  \n\n\n\n75\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n   Instruments That Study Saturn\u2019s Magnetosphere \n\n Saturn\u2019s magnetic  fi eld extends far into space. It has invisible lines of force. See \nFig.  2.37 . Essentially, as the L value drops, the line of force gets stronger. The  fi eld \ndoes not affect the movement of neutral atoms (those with no electrical charge). \nIt also does not affect the moons and rings. However, it affects charged particles \nsuch as ions and electrons.  \n\n Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere is the region where the magnetic  fi eld controls the \nmovement of charged particles. This region extends over a million kilometers \nfrom Saturn. At the outer boundary of the magnetosphere, the planetary magnetic \n fi eld becomes weaker than that in the solar wind. Ions, plasmas and fast-moving \nelectrons are in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere. (Plasma is an electrically neutral mixture \nof ions, electrons and neutral gas.) The distribution of this material depends on the \nmagnetic  fi eld, dust, rings and moons. \n\n  Cassini  has four instrument packages that gather information on the magneto-\nsphere. Table  2.22  summarizes them. Some contain more than one instrument \n(these are labeled a subsystem in the table). Others operate in more than one mode \nor channel. The main function of each subsystem, mode or channel is listed.  \n\n The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (MIMI) measures the characteristics \nof ions and electrons in Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere. One important MIMI  fi nding is \nthat nitrogen ions (N + ) are scarce between the     L 5.7=    and     L 12.6=    shells. This \nis consistent with little or no nitrogen escaping from Titan. Figure  2.37  describes \nL shells. MIMI data also show that ions are scarce near the rings and larger \nmoons. Essentially, these objects are absorbing ions. In addition to the MIMI \ninstrument, the Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS) also collects data on \nthe magnetosphere. \n\n The INMS measures the mass-to-charge ratio of several species. This is an ion\u2019s \nmass, in atomic mass units or amu, divided by its charge. For example, H 2 O \n\n+  has a \nmass of 18 amu and a charge of     1+    and, hence, its mass-to-charge ratio is 18. The \nmass-to-charge ratio of H 2 O \n\n+2 , however, equals     18 2 9\u00b8 =   . In 2004, one group of \nastronomers reported that the INMS detected mass-to-charge peaks at 8, 16, 17, 18, \n23, and 32. The peaks at 16 and 32 are probably the oxygen ions O +  and O  2  \n\n+  . \n A third instrument that collects data on Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere is the Radio \n\nand Plasma Science (RPWS) instrument. It measures radio waves with frequencies \n\n  Fig. 2.37.    Lines of magnetic force (L) associated with Saturn\u2019s magnetic  fi eld are illustrated. The lower the L value, the stronger is the magnetic \n fi eld (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n76\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\nbetween 50 and 500 kHz. These are believed to change as Saturn\u2019s magnetic  fi eld \nrotates and are called Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR). During 1980 and 1981, \nthe SKR changed every 10.656 h. Astronomers selected this as Saturn\u2019s rotational \nperiod. In 2004, the SKR changed every 10.763 h. This is a difference of just over \n0.1 h or 6 min, which is larger than the uncertainty of the measurements. One pos-\nsibility is that Saturn\u2019s rotation rate has changed 6 min. Alternatively, something \nelse is going on. More measurements are needed to understand this change. \n\n The RPWS instrument detects Saturn Electrostatic Discharges (SEDs). These are \nbursts of radio waves with frequencies of between 100 and 40 MHz. Astronomers \nbelieve lightning is the cause of SEDs. The  Voyager  spacecraft  fi rst detected these \nevents in 1980 and 1981.  Cassini\u2019s  RPWS instrument will enable astronomers to \nmonitor the frequency of SEDs over several years. \n\n As  Cassini  approached Saturn, the RPWS instrument detected bursts of SEDs. \nThrough careful study, astronomers discovered three sets of events had periods of \n10.72, 10.26 and 10.66 h. They matched two sets of SEDs with speci fi c clouds. \n\n Imagine a 100-mile-long lightning bolt. The RPWS data are consistent with this \nsize of bolt on Saturn. Essentially, Saturn\u2019s strongest lightning bolts have about a \nmillion times the energy of those on Earth. Although the RPWS collected valuable \ndata, the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) was also useful. \n\n The CAPS carried out a survey of Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere. One group (Young \net al.  2004  )  report that the CAPS data is consistent with Saturn\u2019s magnetosphere \nhaving four different parts. The outer region contains plasma made up mostly of \nprotons. A second inner layer contains protons mixed with the ions O + , OH - , H 2 O \n\n+  \nand H 3 O \n\n+ . A third inner layer rotates at nearly the same speed as Saturn and has \nlots of O + , OH ? , H 2 O \n\n+  and H 3 O \n+  ions. The fourth layer lies near the A ring and has \n\nlots of O +  and O  2  \n+   ions. Astronomers believe the high concentration of O +  and O  2  \n\n+   \nnear the rings is evidence of some oxygen lying above them. Young et al.  (  2004  )  \nestimate a quantity of this gas consistent with it being 10 ?12  times that of Earth\u2019s \natmosphere at sea level. They suggest that high energy particles collide with the ice \nparticles in the rings. This then causes the oxygen to escape. \n\n The CAPS instrument also detected nitrogen ions (N + ) deep in the magneto-\nsphere. These had low kinetic energies, which led one group to believe that the \nnitrogen is ionized in the magnetosphere. Much of this gas may have escaped from \nTitan\u2019s atmosphere.  \n\n   Dust Detecting Equipment \n\n Dust is very common in our Solar System. It causes the zodiacal light and the \ngegenschein. Two dust sources near Saturn are the rings and moons. One question \nthat astronomers want an answer to is, what is its chemical composition, charge, \nsize and concentration of dust? They are also interested in learning more about the \nice plumes above Saturn\u2019s moon Enceladus. \n\n The Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) and the Radio and Plasma Wave Science \ninvestigation (RPWS) are the two dust detectors on  Cassini.  The CDA collects data \non the mass, electric charge, chemical composition and velocity (speed and  fl ight \ndirection) of dust near Saturn. It contains a time-of- fl ight mass spectrometer that \nmeasures the chemical composition of ions produced from particle collisions. The \nRPWS, on the other hand, contains three 10-m electrical antennas that are at nearly \n\n\n\n77\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\nright angles from one another. When a particle collides with an antenna, it is \nvaporized, and part of the vapor becomes ionized. The resulting ions create an \nelectrical signal the antenna detects. Scientists compute the particle mass by meas-\nuring the signal strength. The detection process is illustrated in Fig.  2.38 .  \n\n In 2004, astronomers worried about contamination from  Cassini\u2019s  exhaust. \nAbout 850 lb of exhaust was released during the orbital insertion. Fortunately, the \ncombustion products did not affect the initial CDA measurements.  \n\n   Radio Equipment \n\n The  Cassini  Titan Radar Mapper (RADAR) uses radar to study the Saturn system. \nThis instrument sends out short radar pulses. The RADAR instrument or the Deep \nSpace Network detects them. This instrument also reconstructs radar images. Here \nis how it works. Radar with a frequency of 13.8 GHz (wavelength = 2.17 cm) is \naimed at Titan. It bounces off the surface and back to the receiver. The computer \nconstructs an image. The image contains pixels just like a CCD image. The bright-\nness of each pixel is proportional to the amount of radar re fl ected. The data from \nthe RADAR instrument enabled astronomers to learn more about Saturn and its \nlargest moon, Titan. For example, the RADAR data show evidence of evaporation \non Titan. Essentially, some of the lakes appear to have lost liquid. Some images \neven suggest dried up lakes. These observations have led one group of astrono-\nmers (Stofan et al.  2007  )  to suggest Titan\u2019s lakes may dry up in the summer and \ngrow in the winter. \n\n Astronomers used radar to measure the mass of two of Saturn\u2019s moons. Let\u2019s see \nhow they did this. When a detector moves towards or away from a source of elec-\ntromagnetic radiation, a small shift in frequency occurs. This is called the Doppler \neffect. See Chap.   1    . By measuring this shift, astronomers measure velocity changes. \nThis in turn yields a value of the gravitational acceleration of a nearby moon. With \nthe acceleration and Newton\u2019s law of universal gravitation, astronomers compute \nthe moon\u2019s mass. \n\n Astronomers used the Doppler effect to measure the mass and density of \nSaturn\u2019s moons Phoebe and Iapetus. For example, Rappaport et al.  (  2005  )  report \nmasses of     188.27 10 kg\u00b4    for Phoebe and     211.80 10 kg\u00b4    for Iapetus. Our Moon has \nabout forty times the mass of Iapetus. By combining the diameter and mass, this \ngroup also reports densities of     31,600 20 kg / m\u00b1    for Phoebe and     31,105  27 kg / m\u00b1    \nfor Iapetus. These values are larger than pure water ice ~940 kg/m 3 . This is evi-\ndence that both contain other materials besides ice.   \n\n  Fig. 2.38.

It follows a \nhighly elliptical orbit around Earth. See Fig.  2.39 . This satellite has a 10-m radio \ndish. When combined with ground-based telescopes it is expected to produce radio \nimages of unprecedented resolution. This is how it will work. Astronomers will use \na technique called interferometry. Essentially, they will combine the signals from \ntwo or more telescopes at different locations. When this is done, the resulting sig-\nnal is equivalent to that from a single instrument equal to the spacing between the \ntelescopes. For example, the Very Large Array (VLA) works on this principle. \nEssentially, it is 27 radio telescopes arranged in a Y pattern. These may be up to \n40 km (25 miles) apart. With this arrangement, VLA signals are equivalent to those \ncoming from a single 40 km instrument. Astronomers may attain a radio-frequency \nresolution of ~1.0 arc second from this facility.  \n\n As a second example, the Very Long Baseline Array or VLBA is a group of radio \ntelescopes spread across the United States that are linked to each other. Signals \nfrom the VLBA are equivalent to those from an instrument the size of the United \nStates. The motivating factor behind both the VLA and VLBA is the larger the \ntelescope, the higher the resolution. Russian astronomers plan to combine data \nfrom Spektr-R and Earth-based telescopes to generate signals that would be \nequivalent to an instrument around 300,000 km across. They are hoping to attain \nradio-frequency resolutions better than 0.001 arc second.  \n\n   Gaia \n Between 1989 and 1993, the  Hipparcos  satellite measured positions of about one \nmillion stars. It revolutionized our view of our galaxy and the universe. For exam-\nple, it has helped re fi ne the distance scale for Cepheid variable stars. Henrietta \nSwan Leavitt (1868\u20131921)  fi rst discovered the period-luminosity relationship of \nthese stars in 1908, and since then astronomers have used them to determine the \ndistance to galaxies and other objects. \n\n One byproduct of the  Hipparcos  data is the Millennium Star Atlas \u00a91997 by \nR. W. Sinnott and M. A. C. Perryman. This atlas shows the positions of about a \nmillion stars down to magnitude 12 on a convenient grid, the proper motion of \nthousands of stars, positions and orientations of thousands of deep sky objects, \npositions and separations of about 22,000 double stars and approximate  brightness \n\n  Fig. 2.39.

This atlas also shows the brightness of each star in about \nthe same way that we would see it in the sky. The follow-up spacecraft of  Hipparcos  \nis  Gaia.  Most of the technical details which are presented about  Gaia  are from the \nwebsites   http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=26    ,   http://gaia.\nesa.int/    , from Dambeck  (  2008  )  and McDowell  (  2006h  ) . \n\n The European and Russian space agencies plan to launch this spacecraft in 2013 \nwith a Soyuz rocket from French Guiana. It will travel to near the Sun-Earth L 2  \npoint and enter a Lassajous-type orbit. Figure  2.40  shows the orbit and Figure 1.25 \nshows the L 2  point.  \n\n  Gaia  will move in an elliptical path around the L 2  point. The orbital period \naround L 2  will be 180 days. The advantage of such an orbit is that the spacecraft \nwill avoid entering Earth\u2019s shadow. Earth\u2019s shadow will lead to signi fi cant cooling \nof the instruments and will introduce error. Since the L 2  point orbits the Sun once \na year, this spacecraft will image all parts of the sky. Plans call for  Gaia  to spin \nslowly around an axis pointed 45\u00b0 from the Sun. This will allow the solar arrays to \ncollect an adequate amount of sunlight. It will also insure transmitters are aimed \nat Earth. Radio antennas located in Cebreros, Spain, and New Norcia, Australia, will \nreceive  Gaia\u2019s  signals. \n\n Once  Gaia  is in deep space, its Sun shield will unfold. See Fig.  2.41 . This shield \nwill serve two purposes. First, it will supply power. Second, it will prevent direct \nsunlight from heating the instruments. In space nothing spreads out direct sun-\nlight. Therefore, components in direct sunlight may reach high temperatures. The \nSun shield will keep the electrical components in continuous shade, and this will \nlead to a nearly constant temperature.  \n\n The mirror-camera assembly will carry out the critical measurements. It will con-\ntain two rectangular mirrors with dimensions of 0.5 by 1.45 m (20 in. by 57 in.). \nThese will collect starlight and focus it onto optical components.  Gaia  will image two \nareas of the sky simultaneously. These will be 106.5\u00b0 apart. Each image is expected to \ncontain around 20,000 stars. Throughout its 5-year mission, each object brighter \nthan magnitude 20 should be imaged about 70 times. These objects will include stars, \nasteroids, brown dwarfs, comets, planets and natural satellites.  Gaia  should also \nimage arti fi cial satellites. Table  2.23  lists some technical details of  Gaia.   \n\n  Fig. 2.41.    This sequence shows how  Gaia\u2019s  Sun shield will open up (Credit: ESA \u2013 C. Carreau).       \n\n  Fig. 2.40.

Firstly, it will measure \npositions. Objects brighter than about magnitude 15 will be measured to an \naccuracy of 24 micro arc seconds. This is equivalent to a  fl ashlight at the Moon\u2019s \ndistance moving 4.6 cm. Secondly, this spacecraft will carry out brightness meas-\nurements. Since CCD detectors will be used above our atmosphere, the accuracy of \nthe measurements should be around 0.001 magnitudes for objects brighter than \nmagnitude 15 and may be 0.02 magnitudes for objects at magnitude 20. Thirdly, it \nwill record spectra. According to McDowell  (  2008h  ) , it will use the spectra of 150 \nmillion stars to determine radial velocities. With these measurements, astronomers \nwill be able to determine both the velocity of stars in all three dimensions and their \ndistances. Let\u2019s explain. \n\n  Gaia  will start off imaging a star\u2019s spectrum. Let\u2019s assume it images an absorp-\ntion spectrum showing the hydrogen-alpha line. If the star is not moving towards \nor away from us, this line should be at a wavelength of 656.3 nm. If, however, this \nstar is moving towards us the hydrogen-alpha line will shift to a shorter wave-\nlength. The hydrogen-alpha absorption line should shift to a longer wavelength, \nhowever, if the star is moving away from us. See Fig.  2.42 . This shift is caused by the \nDoppler effect, which is described in Chap.   1    . This shift enables astronomers to \nmeasure the velocity towards or away from us. Accurate position measurements \nenable astronomers to measure the other two velocity components. Therefore, by \nmeasuring the Doppler shift along with precise star positions, astronomers can \nmeasure the velocity of each star in all three dimensions.  \n\n  Gaia  will also measure the parallax of stars. The parallax of an object is the \napparent shift in its position caused by the changing line of sight. The line of \nsight runs through the observer\u2019s eye (or instrument) and the object. In order to \nillustrate parallax, try the following experiment. Focus on a nearby object with a \nmore distant object in the background. Open just your left eye and note the posi-\ntion of the object with respect to the background object. Now close your left eye \nand open your right eye. The nearby object should have shifted position with \nrespect to the background object. Now view the object by opening one eye and then \nthe other. The object should appear to move back and forth with respect to the \nbackground object. Repeat this experiment for a more distant object. The more \ndistant object may appear to shift, but the shift should be smaller than what it was \n\n   Table 2.23.

The right and left eye are about 7 cm apart, and therefore, the \nline of sight changes. This change is large for nearby objects. It becomes small, \nhowever, for more distant ones. See Fig.  2.43 .  \n\n As  Gaia  moves around our Sun, its line of sight changes. The stellar parallax is \nthe shift in the position of a star. In our case,  Gaia  is the observer. For  Gaia,  the \nrelationship between parallax (p) and distance (d) is:\n\n     \n   \n\n  \n- \u00b4\n\n=\n1.0 arc seconds parsec\n\nd\np\n\n   (2.1)   \n\n Therefore, if a parallax of 24 micro arc seconds (0.000024 arc \u2013 seconds) is measured, \nthe distance would be just over 42,000 parsecs. This is near the edge of our galaxy. \n\n  Fig. 2.42.    The hydrogen absorption feature is at 656.3 nm when the star is not moving towards or away from the observer ( top spectrum ). \nIf the star is moving away from the observer, the absorption feature will shift to a longer wavelength (657.0 nm in the  bottom spectrum ). This is the \nDoppler effect (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n  Fig. 2.43.    A nearby object shifts position when one looks at it with just the left eye and then with just the right eye. The nearby object appears \nto be to the  right  of the distant object when viewed with just the left eye. The opposite occurs through the right eye. This shift is caused by the chang-\ning line of sight and is called parallax (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n82\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n One dif fi culty with measuring the parallax of a star is the distance of the \nbackground stars. If these stars are almost as close as the one being measured the \ndistance would be incorrect. To make matters more complicated, we are dealing \nwith a large number of stars. It is for these reasons that  Gaia  will solve for stellar \ndistances differently. At the end of its mission, it will help astronomers solve for the \ndistances of at least 150 million stars all at once. This was impossible with 1993 \ncomputer technology, but it should be possible in 2018. The star data from  Gaia  \nmay be available as early as 2020. \n\n How will astronomers use  Gaia  data? They plan to use it to focus on several \nareas, including our Solar System, neighboring stars, our galaxy, objects beyond \nour galaxy and tests on Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity. Here you will learn \nabout a few of these. \n\n   Solar System Studies \n\n  Gaia  is expected to image about 250,000 asteroids. Centaurs and Trans-Neptune \nobjects (TNOs) will also be targets. Asteroids, centaurs and most TNOs are too \nsmall to be classi fi ed as planets or dwarf planets. They orbit our Sun and are not \ncomets. Asteroids lie inside Jupiter\u2019s orbit, Centaurs lie between the orbits of \nJupiter and Neptune and TNOs lie beyond Neptune\u2019s orbit. See Fig.  2.44 .  \n\n Astronomers will re fi ne the orbits, rotational rates, photometric constants, and \nlight curves of many of these objects with  Gaia  data. They also expect to discover \nseveral thousand new asteroids along with perhaps a few dozen centaurs and \nTNOs. Astronomers will undoubtedly discover new comets in  Gaia  data. In addi-\ntion to this, the Trojan asteroids around Jupiter and perhaps other planets will be \nexamined. Trojan asteroids for Jupiter are those which lie near the Jupiter-Sun L 4  \nand L 5  points. See Fig.  2.45 .  \n\n  Fig. 2.44.    Asteroids lie inside Jupiter\u2019s orbit, Centaurs lie between the orbits of Jupiter and Neptune and Trans-Neptune Objects lie beyond the \norbit of Neptune (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n83\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n Astronomers will use the data to determine whether Jupiter\u2019s Trojans formed \nnear that planet or formed in another part of our Solar System and were later cap-\ntured.  Gaia  will also search for objects in our Solar System that have high orbital \ninclinations. Astronomers hope to measure asteroid masses from  Gaia  data. Let\u2019s \nsee how this will be done. \n\n When two asteroids get close, they will exert a gravitational force on one another. \nThe force that each exerts will alter the acceleration of the other. The closer they pass, \nthe greater will be this change. In most cases, one asteroid will be larger than the \nother. In these cases, the smaller one will experience a larger acceleration than the \nother one. It is this change that  Gaia  will measure. Astronomers will then use it to \ncompute the mass of the larger asteroid. \n\n As of 2011, the eight major planets in our Solar System have 168 known moons. \nPluto has four more.  Gaia  will gather additional positional and photometric data \non many of these. This will be more accurate than similar measurements from \nEarth. Scientists may determine the rotational periods of the smaller moons from \n Gaia  data. \n\n One important question is \u201cAre we seeing more long-period comets than in the \ndistant past?\u201d One way to answer this question is to examine the velocities and \ndistances of nearby stars. Astronomers believe that when a star makes a close pass \nto our Solar System some of the icy objects are pushed towards our Sun and \nbecome comets.  Gaia  will carry out extensive measurements of all stars within 50 \nparsecs (or about 160 light years) of our Solar System. With this information, \nastronomers should be able to reconstruct more reliable star distances in the past. \nThey should also be able to determine when stars made close encounters with the \nOort Cloud. This should enable them to determine the frequency of long-period \ncomets in the past and future.  \n\n  Fig. 2.45.    The Trojan asteroids lie at the Jupiter-Sun L 4  and L 5  points. The L 4  point precedes Jupiter by 60\u00b0 and the L 5  point follows Jupiter \nby 60\u00b0 (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n84\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n   Studies of Neighboring Stars \n\n Astronomers plan to carry out star studies with  Gaia  data. For example, brightness \nmeasurements will be more accurate than what we have today. They hope to search \nfor new variable stars. They may determine the percentages of different classes of \nvariable stars. Finally,  Gaia  data will allow them to search for extrasolar planets, \nthrough the transit method, the star-wobble method or the direct imaging method. \nLet\u2019s look at the last two. \n\n Consider a star having 20 times the mass of a nearby planet and both objects are \n20 light years from Earth. Furthermore, let\u2019s assume no other planets are orbiting \nthe star and the planet makes one trip around the star in 2 years. As it turns out, \nthe planet and star move around the center of mass (CM) of the planet-star system. \nIn our case, the CM lies a short distance from the center of the star. The planet \ntravels a greater distance than the star because it is farther from the CM. \nNevertheless, the star will also move. Examine Fig.  2.46a . When the planet is to the \nright of the CM, the star is to the left of it. One year later (Fig.  2.46b ) the planet and \nstar have shifted. They are now left and right of the CM, respectively. Therefore, in \n1 year, the star has shifted from one side of the CM to the other. If the planet is 1.0 \nastronomical unit (au) from the star the planet and star would have shifted 1.9 and \n0.1 au, respectively. At a distance of 20 light years, the star will shift 0.03 arc sec-\nonds.  Gaia  will be able to detect the shift. Astronomers hope to discover thousands \nof new extrasolar planets using this technique.  \n\n Will  Gaia  be able to image planets around other stars? Possibly; let\u2019s explain. \nIf we assume the planet in Fig.  2.46  has the same albedo and size as Jupiter it would \nreach a peak brightness of magnitude 21. This is below  Gaia\u2019s  limit. To make mat-\nters worse, at this peak brightness, the planet will be near superior conjunction \nand, hence, close to the star. See Fig.  2.47 . At other times the planet will be farther \nfrom the star but will be dimmer because of its smaller phase. Some extrasolar \nplanets, however, may have extensive ring systems.  Gaia  could detect such a planet. \nIn addition to this, several stars are closer to us than 20 light years. Perhaps  Gaia  \nwill image a planet around one of these.   \n\n  Fig. 2.46.    The \u00d7 is the  center  of mass of the planet-star system. When the planet is to the  right  of the \u00d7, the star is just a little to the  left  \n(frame a). One half of a revolution later, the planet is now  left  of the \u00d7. During this time the star has also moved around the  center  of mass and is \njust to the  right  of the \u00d7 (frame b). In some cases, astronomers will be able to detect the shift in star position and, hence, determine the mass of the \nplanet (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n85\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n   Studies of Our Galaxy \n\n Astronomers also hope to learn more about our galaxy by examining  Gaia  data. \nFor example, they hope to better understand the ongoing collision between The \nMilky Way and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Astronomers will search for groups of \nstars passing through our galaxy. In Fig.  2.48 , the velocity of many stars have been \nplotted. The velocities may all look random, but take a closer look. Notice many of \nthe smallest stars do not have a random motion but are instead traveling in nearly \nthe same direction. Essentially, they are a group of stars passing through.   \n\n   Objects Beyond Our Galaxy \n\n Astronomers also hope to learn more about certain objects lying beyond our gal-\naxy. Data from  Gaia  should lead to the discovery of many new novas and superno-\nvas. (A nova is a mild stellar explosion usually taking place in the outer layers of a \nstar whereas a supernova is larger explosion usually taking place near the center \nof a star.) Once a nova or supernova is discovered, astronomers will be alerted and \nwill carry out follow-up measurements. They also hope to discover and character-\nize many new quasars. (A quasar is a distant object less than one light year across \nthat gives off about 10 11  times as much light as what our Sun gives off.)  \n\n   Tests of Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity \n\n Astronomers plan to test Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity. Essentially, they \nwill measure star positions near our Sun. The General Theory of Relativity predicts \nthe path of light changes when it is close to a large source of gravity. If this is \n\n  Fig. 2.47.    An extrasolar planet will be at peak brightness at full phase. The problem though is it will also appear next to the star as seen from \nEarth. An extrasolar planet will be easiest to image when it is farthest from its parent star. In this situation, it will be at half-phase and, hence, dimmer \nthan at full phase (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n86\n\nSc\nie\n\nn\nti\nfi\nc \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\n \nSp\n\na\nce\n\ncr\na\nft\n\n  Fig. 2.48.

Government agencies such as the U. S. \nGeological Survey (USGS) operate many of them. In many cases, satellite data is \nsold to companies that analyze it, construct new data products and sell these. \nA good example is a weather company. It buys satellite data, uses it to make \ndetailed weather forecasts, and then sells these forecasts to airlines. An airline, such \nas Delta, then uses the forecasts to determine whether it is safe to  fl y an aircraft or \nwhat areas will have extreme air turbulence. A  fl ight might also be diverted to \nanother airport because of extreme wind shear. Wind shear is able to tear a plane \napart and, hence, this diversion can save lives. Wind shear is described in Chap.   1    . \n\n Organizations in the United States, Russia, Japan and Europe own most of the \nEarth observing satellites. Other countries, however, also own and operate them. \nTable  3.1  lists some Earth-observing satellites. Most of the information in this \nchapter is from the websites listed in this table. Most of the satellites operate in \ntheir own unique way and study speci fi c characteristics of our planet. In the next \nfew pages, you will learn about these satellites.   \n\n     Earth Observing Satellites \n     SeaWiFS \n\n Have you ever seen greenish pond scum? The organisms have this color because \nthey contain chlorophyll \u2013 a green compound used in photosynthesis. Similar \norganisms called phytoplankton live near the surface of the ocean. They cause \nparts of the ocean to change color. Essentially, the more phytoplankton there is, the \ngreener the ocean. They also affect our atmosphere by consuming carbon dioxide. \nTherefore, scientists interested in how these organisms impact our atmosphere \n\nR.

This instrument has eight  fi lters which transmit different \nwavelengths of visible and near-infrared light. Filter transmission ranges are \nshown in Fig.  3.1 . Color data enables the scientist to determine the amount of phy-\ntoplankton in the ocean. This microscopic life form is near the bottom of the food \nchain. Therefore, ocean ecosystems depend on it. Scientists are also interested in \nlearning the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton, and this is best accomplished with \n SeaWiFS  data.  \n\n The  SeaWiFS  satellite is able to image 90% of the ocean in just 2 days. It can \nresolve features as small as 1.1 km at the nadir position. (This is the position look-\ning straight down.) The satellite is able to image an area up to 1,500 km across. This \nis wider than the state of Texas. \n\n   Table 3.1.

This is because the organisms consume carbon dioxide in photosyn-\nthesis. Scientists will use  SeaWiFS  data to better understand the Earth\u2019s carbon \ncycle and how phytoplankton impacts our atmosphere.  \n\n     Landsat 7 \n\n  Landsat 7  is the seventh satellite in the Landsat series dating back to 1972. Since \n1972, scientists have assembled an extensive databank of Earth images. These are \nin different wavelengths of visible and infrared light. The objectives of  Landsat 7  \nare: (1) image the surface of Earth, (2) provide continuity with previous Landsat \nsatellites, (3) offer a 16-day repetitive Earth coverage, and (4) make the images \nwidely available at a nominal cost. Since 1999,  Landsat 7  has remained about \n700 km above Earth\u2019s surface in a nearly circular orbit. \n\n The Enhanced Thermatic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on  Landsat 7  is capable of \ncarrying out imaging spectroscopy. It points straight down (the nadir direction). \nThis instrument has a Ritchey-Cretien telescope with a 0.41 m primary mirror. The \nfocal length is 2.4 m. It is coated with silver. The telescope collects light and then \nfocuses it onto a detector. The detector produces an image covering 185 by 180 km, \nwhich is about the size of New York City and suburbs. \n\n The ETM + uses eight different  fi lters. See Fig.  3.1 . Two of these transmit in the \nvisible region, and the others transmit in the infrared region. Most of the  fi lters \nhave a resolution of 30 m/pixel. \n\n How can  Landsat 7  image nearly the entire Earth? It orbits Earth once every \n99 min, and as a result, the ground trace shifts ~25\u00b0 of longitude. After 1 day, it is \n~13\u00b0 of longitude from where it started. It continues moving around Earth for the \nsecond through sixteenth days, always missing its start position by a little. After 16 \nfull days, this satellite  fl ies over its initial path and the cycle starts over. The shift in \n\n  Fig. 3.1.

Furthermore, there \nare 248 places where it may record an image on each path. As a result, there are \n248 \u00d7 233 = 57,784 different positions. Over the course of the 16-day cycle, it will \nhave  fl own over most of the world. Two adjacent images overlap. This overlap \ninsures that no area is missed. Since  Landsat 7  has an orbital inclination of 98.2\u00b0, \nit does not cross over the North and South poles. As a result, it does not image areas \nnorth of 83\u00b0N or south of 83\u00b0S. Figure  3.2  shows an image constructed from \n Landsat 7  and  Airsar  data.  \n\n Although  Landsat 7   fl ies over most of Earth in 16 days, it does not image every one \nof the 57,784 different positions during each 16-day cycle. Instead, areas are priori-\ntized. Several factors determine whether an area will be imaged. Cloud coverage \nplays a big role. An image showing just clouds will have little or no useful data. \nTherefore, when clouds are predicted to cover an area it is not imaged. For similar \nreasons, areas that have low Sun altitudes, such as those in northern Canada during \nthe winter, receive a low priority. Areas that are not undergoing signi fi cant change, \nlike those experiencing winter, are also given a low priority. On the other hand, areas \nwith a large  fi re, a  fl ood, or an active volcano receive a high priority. Similarly those \nthat were missed in previous 16-day cycles receive a high priority. Areas experiencing \nrapid change such as what happens during the spring also receive a high priority. \n\n With different  fi lters, one may produce low resolution spectra from Landsat \ndata. Using a combination of images and spectra, scientists may monitor the health \nof crops, estimate the effects of urban sprawl on the environment, and monitor \nwater resources. Furthermore, since Landsat satellites have operated since 1972, \nscientists may study environmental changes covering several decades. \n\n  Landsat 7  also measures temperatures. It is able to do this because Earth emits \ninfrared radiation with wavelengths between 8 and 12  m m. This overlaps with  fi lter \n#6. Temperatures are measured in a similar way as is described in Chap.   1    .  \n\n  Fig. 3.2.    An image of the Okmok volcano on Umnak Island, one of Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands. This volcano is at 54.4\u00b0N, 168.1\u00b0W. Scientists \nused  Landsat 7  and  Airsar  data to construct this image. This image is 16 km or 10 miles wide (Credit: NASA/JPL/ASF).       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_1\n\n\n93\n\nEa\nrt\n\nh\n O\n\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\na\nn\nd\n W\n\nea\nth\n\ner\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n\n     QuikScat \n\n Meteorologists need wind data to forecast weather. Winds determine the movements \nof clouds and hurricane strength. They can also lead to wind shear, which is danger-\nous for aircraft. Therefore, wind data is of great importance. It is dif fi cult to measure \nhigh-altitude winds and those over the ocean. This is where data from the  QuikScat  \nsatellite becomes important. It emits pulses of radio waves with a frequency of \n13.4 GHz. These hit Earth and bounce back. See Fig.  3.3 . The backscattered radiation \nvaries with the wind speed and direction. Therefore, scientists can examine the \nbackscattered radiation and compute the wind speed and direction. They are able \nto measure winds in an area as small as 25 km across. Uncertainties in the wind \nspeed and wind direction are about 12% and 20\u00b0, respectively.  \n\n Since  QuikScat  spins 18 times a minute, radar from several different angles \nstrikes several locations. As a result, scientists are able to measure the wind speed \nand direction for almost any area of interest. It uses radio waves to collect wind \ndata and can operate under almost all weather conditions. \n\n In addition to yielding data on winds,  QuikScat  has many other applications. \nIt can track icebergs. Most of an iceberg lies underwater. Furthermore, icebergs \nmove with ocean currents. For these reasons, icebergs are a hazard to shipping. \n QuikScat  data yields up-to-date coordinates of hazardous icebergs. It also yields \ninformation on the amount of moisture in the soil. See Fig.  3.4 . This is important \nfor the control of wild fi res. Scientists may also monitor vegetation growth and \nchanges.   \n\n     Terra \n\n Have you ever felt relief from the summer heat when a cloud passed in front of the \nSun? Have you ever felt a cool sea breeze? Has an annoying vapor trail from a plane \never blocked your view of a star or planet? If you answered yes to any of these ques-\ntions, you would have witnessed the interaction between the ocean, atmosphere \nand land. The  Terra  satellite has  fi ve instruments, which are designed to monitor \nthe atmosphere, land masses, ice caps and bodies of water. More importantly, it \ngives scientists information on how the different parts of Earth\u2019s biosphere interact \nwith one another. \n\n  Fig. 3.3.

Aerosols are microscopic particles that  fl oat in the \natmosphere. Figure  3.5  shows an image of ship tracks. These form when a ship gives \noff aerosols that act as condensation nuclei for water vapor. Water vapor condenses \non them, forming droplets. We see millions of these as long, thin clouds. The result-\ning cloud affects temperatures and winds. A similar process also occurs behind \nplanes and in areas with large amounts of aerosols. One important question is: \n\u201cDo aerosols affect the frequency of clouds?\u201d Data from the  Terra  satellite should \nhelp answer this question.  \n\n A second application of the Terra satellite is to monitor the movement and tem-\nperature of large ice sheets. In some cases, large chunks of ice break off, becoming \nicebergs. Figure  3.6  shows a sequence of three images taken in November of 2000 \nthat show a large chunk of ice breaking off from west Antarctica. Ice sheets have \nbroken apart throughout Earth\u2019s history. The question: \u201cIs there a change in the \nfrequency of ice sheets breaking apart over time?\u201d Scientists hope to answer this \nquestion with  Terra.   \n\n The  Terra  satellite is able to peer down a dangerous volcano at a safe distance. \n Terra  is able to measure temperatures.

This image shows the Russian \nvolcano Shiveluch on January 25, 2011. The bright spot just above the center is hot \nmagma. This satellite will enable scientists to pinpoint the path of any approaching \nmolten rock.  \n\n  Terra  is one of several satellites that are in the same orbit and follow one another. \nThese are called the A-Train. At one point, the A-Train had six satellites:  Aqua  \n(leading satellite),  Terra, Aura, CloudSat, Calipso  and  Parsol.  Each of these carried out \na different measurement. This allowed scientists to better understand processes \nwhich are at work in Earth\u2019s oceans, atmosphere and land masses.  \n\n     ACRIMSAT \n\n In the last few years there has been a lot of debate about climate change, global \nheating and greenhouse gases. If global heating is real, what is causing it? Is it \ncaused solely by the increase in greenhouse gases in our atmosphere or are other \nfactors responsible? Many believe this is a complex issue that needs to be examined \nthoroughly before laws are enacted. One factor which undoubtedly drives climate \nchange is the variability of our Sun. Table  3.2  lists a few events that affect the \namount of sunlight hitting Earth. The  Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor \nSatellite   (ACRIMSAT)  is designed to measure the amount of energy coming from \nour Sun.  \n\n The  ACRIMSAT  satellite measures the total amount of energy coming from the \nSun; this is called Total Solar Irradiance, or TSI. It takes measurements with an \naccuracy of 0.01%. We know the TSI (or solar constant) is ~1,366 W/m 2  at Earth. \nThis is the amount of solar energy striking 1 m 2  of the top of our atmosphere when \n\n  Fig. 3.7.

This number, however, changes. Since 1978, scientists \nhave used satellites to measure the TSI. A compilation of these measurements is \nlisted on the  ACRIMSAT  website. Measurements were usually made about once a \nday. The average values of the TSI for every 0.1 year is compared. Figure  3.8  shows \nthe results. Between 1978 and 2010, the TSI changed. It reached maximum values \nin 1979, 1991 and 2000, and it reached minimum values in 1986, 1996 and 2007. \nThe difference between the maximum and minimum values was up to 3.0 W/m 2 . \nThis is ~0.2% of the TSI. Willson and Mordvinov  (  2003  )  report an increase of 0.05% \nper decade. This undoubtedly affects our climate. Future  ACRIMSAT  data should \nenable astronomers to learn more about how our Sun drives climate change.   \n\n     Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) \n\n The three instruments on  EO-1  are the Advanced Land Imager (ALI), the Hyperion \nHigh Resolution Spectral Imager (Hyperion) and the Linear Etalon Imaging \nSpectrometer Array atmospheric collector (LAC). The ALI has ten different  fi lters \nthat span wavelengths of between 0.48 and 2.35  m m. It is capable of yielding images \nwith a resolution of 10\u201330 m depending on the  fi lter used. At an altitude of 705 km, \nit images a 20 by 180 km area. The Hyperion instrument is able to construct images \nin 220 different spectral bands. Scientists are also able to collect spectra with it. \nImages are 7.5 by 100 km and have resolutions of 30 m. Figure  3.9  shows three \n\n   Table 3.2.

These images enable \nscientists to learn about its ash and steam clouds. The LAC instrument collects \ndata of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. This is used to calibrate measurements taken with the \nother instruments.  \n\n During the  fi rst year of operation, EO-1 was a technology demonstration mission. \nEssentially, the ALI was lighter and used less power than older cameras. It per-\nformed well enough that an extended mission was funded. As of early 2011, this \nsatellite is still operating. Some of the applications of it include imaging areas \naffected by natural disasters, mineral mapping and estimating crop yield.  \n\n     Jason-1 \n\n Any increase in sea level may make coastal areas inhabitable. For this reason, it \nshould be watched. A rise in temperature or the melting of ice on land will cause \nocean levels to rise.  Jason-1  and its successor,  Jason-2,  are designed to measure sea \nlevel to an accuracy of ~2.5 cm. These satellites take measurements over most of \nthe Atlantic, Indian and Paci fi c oceans. \n\n The  Jason-1  satellite has four instruments that measure its exact position and \nvelocity. This is needed to record accurate measurements of sea level. These four are \nthe Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositoning Integrated by Satellite (Doris), the \nJason Microwave Radiometer (JMR), the Turbo Rogue Space Receiver (TRSR) and \nthe Laser Retrore fl ector Array (LRA). The Doris instrument is used to measure the \n\n  Fig. 3.9.    Three images of the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull icecap and nearby volcano.

This is described in Chap.   1    . \nThe JMR measures the amount of water vapor in the troposphere. This affects the \ncomputed satellite altitude by up to 50 cm. The TRST instrument has a receiver that \npicks up Global Positioning Satellite signals from navigation satellites. These enable \nscientists to determine  Jason-1\u2019s  orbit to a high degree of accuracy. A fourth instrument, \nthe LRA, is a system of mirrors. Laser pulses from the ground are directed at the LRA, \nwhich re fl ects the light back. By measuring the length of time for the laser light to \nreturn, scientists measure the altitude of  Jason-1  to within a few millimeters. \nThis serves as a calibration for the Doris, JMR and TRSR measurements. \n\n The  fi fth instrument, the Poseidon-2 altimeter, measures the distance between \nthe satellite and the ocean surface. It sends out pulses of radio waves that bounce \noff the ocean and come back. Scientists measure the time it takes the pulses to \ncome back and compute the distance. With accurate satellite position, scientists \nmay determine the ocean levels to a high degree of accuracy. \n\n Two follow-up missions to  Jason-1  are  Jason-2  and the  Ocean Surface Topography \nMission (OSTM) . Both satellites will monitor the level of the oceans over several years. \n\n What have scientists found out from  Jason-1  and  Jason-2  data? We know the \noceans are not exactly level at large scales even after the effects of lunar and solar \ntides are eliminated. The affects of waves on scales of a few feet are averaged out \nover many miles. Figure  3.10  shows a  Jason-2  false-color image of the Paci fi c \nOcean. The colors correspond to altitudes. Purple and blue are low altitudes. Red \nand orange are high altitudes. Apparently, the Paci fi c Ocean level changes by \nseveral centimeters. The bluish areas are about 5\u201313 cm below the average level. \nThis is caused by lower-than-average ocean temperatures. Those low temperatures \nlead to the La Ni\u00f1a effect.   \n\n  Fig. 3.10.    This false color image shows different altitudes of the ocean.  Blue  indicates the ocean is about 10 cm lower than normal. This is \nconsistent with lower temperatures that are attributed to La Ni\u00f1a. The  Jason-2  satellite recorded this data on June 11, 2010. Images like this one will \nallow meteorologists to make weather forecasts several weeks into the future (Credit: NASA/JPL Ocean Surface Topography Team).       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_1\n\n\n100\n\nEa\nrt\n\nh\n O\n\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\na\nn\nd\n W\n\nea\nth\n\ner\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n     Aqua \n\n  Aqua  carries out several types of atmospheric measurements. These are made at \ndifferent altitudes. It also measures ocean temperatures. \n\n  Aqua  contains six different instruments. One of them, the Advanced Microwave \nScanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System or AMSR-E, measures the \nmicrowaves coming from Earth\u2019s surface. Once correction factors are applied, sci-\nentists may measure the quantity of microwaves being emitted. This yields land \nand ocean temperatures. Since this instrument is based on microwaves, it operates \nunder cloudy and clear conditions. The only time that it cannot collect data is \nwhen lots of rain or snow are falling. The conditions under which the AMSR-E can \n(and cannot operate) are illustrated in Fig.  3.11 .  \n\n A second instrument on  Aqua  is the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). \nIt measures spectra between wavelengths of 0.4 and 15.4  m m. These yield tem-\nperatures at different altitudes in our atmosphere. These are helpful for weather \nforecasting. \n\n One speci fi c application of AIRS is to measure the temperature of hurricanes and \ntyphoons. Figure  3.12  shows a false color image of the typhoon Yasi as it passed over \nthe east coast of Australia. Colors correspond to different temperatures. Red and \norange correspond to high temperatures. Purple and blue correspond to lower ones. \nThis image also shows Yasi still retained its spiral structure after it made landfall.  \n\n The  Aqua  satellite has four other instruments, namely the Advanced Microwave \nSounding Unit-A (AMSU-A), Cloud and Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES), \nHumidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging \nSpectroradiometer (MODIS). These are designed to detect water vapor in the \natmosphere and carry out cloud measurements. This data helps scientists learn \nmore about Earth\u2019s water cycle. \n\n This satellite will also keep track of Earth\u2019s radiation budget. Let\u2019s explore what \nthis is. \n\n The radiation budget summarizes the amount of energy reaching and leaving \nEarth. If the amount given off is less than what is coming in, Earth will get hotter; \notherwise it will get colder. Sunlight, mostly in the form of visible light, reaches \nhalf of Earth at any given time. The light reaching Earth warms up the atmosphere. \nSome of it also warms up the surface. Light leaves Earth through three processes: \nrefraction/scattering, re fl ection and emission. Our atmosphere refracts and scatters \nabout 1% of the sunlight. This is discussed further in Chap.   6    . About one-third of \nit is re fl ected. The remaining 60\u201370% is emitted mostly as infrared radiation. \nThe radiation budget is illustrated in Fig.  3.13 .  \n\n  Fig. 3.11.    The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) on the  Aqua  satellite measures the number of \nmicrowaves that Earth\u2019s land and oceans emit. Rain and snow prevent useful microwaves from reaching the satellite (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_6\n\n\n101\n\nEa\nrt\n\nh\n O\n\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\na\nn\nd\n W\n\nea\nth\n\ner\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n There are several factors that may affect Earth\u2019s radiation budget. For example, \n\nthe percentage of re fl ected sunlight depends on the amount of cloud cover along \nwith the amount of snow and vegetation present. Other factors such as clouds, \nsnow and ice cover, the relative humidity and changes caused by human activity \nalso affect Earth\u2019s radiation budget. The amount of greenhouse gases may also \naffect it. In fact, scientists are interested in knowing whether the amount of infra-\nred radiation emitted into space is changing with the rising carbon dioxide levels. \nSome scientists believe human-made changes to our atmosphere are causing the \namount of escaping heat to drop, leading to global heating. \n\n Data from the various instruments on  Aqua  will enable scientists to learn how \nthe radiation budget affects our weather and climate. It will also help us learn \nwhether this budget is changing.  \n\n  Fig. 3.12.

Clouds and the surface re fl ect just over a third of the solar radiation. Most \nof the remainder is absorbed and later emitted as infrared radiation. Our atmosphere refracts and scatters about 1% (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n102\n\nEa\nrt\n\nh\n O\n\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\na\nn\nd\n W\n\nea\nth\n\ner\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n     GRACE \n\n In physics class, you probably learned that Earth\u2019s gravitational acceleration at \nsea level equals 9.81 m/s 2 . This is correct; however, Earth\u2019s gravity changes a little. \nThe gravity changes by 0.001\u20130.01% over a period of hours to years. Some of the \nfactors that cause it to change include rain, snowfall, the drying up of the ground, \nearthquakes, the growth or shrinkage of aquifers, the growth or loss of vegetation \nand the growth of lakes next to a dam. A redistribution of water vapor in our \natmosphere may also cause a change in gravity. In short, any redistribution of mass \nwill cause a change in the local gravity. The  GRACE  satellite system is designed to \nmeasure Earth\u2019s gravity at different locations. We will now learn how scientists \nmake these measurements. \n\n The distance between the two identical  GRACE  satellites yields gravity data. They \nfollow the same orbit and are about 220 km apart. Each contains GPS equipment \nalong with microwave ranging instruments. The equipment allows scientists to \ncompute the exact distance between them. Figure  3.14  illustrates how scientists \ndetect a gravity change. In the top frame, the satellites are distance X apart. In the \nbottom frame, the leading satellite approaches an area with a higher than normal \ngravity. The leading satellite accelerates more to this area than the trailing one. This \nis because the gravitational  fi eld increases with the inverse square of the distance. \nAs a result of the difference in acceleration, the distance between them is now \nX +  D x. Scientists use the  D x value to compute the difference in gravity.  \n\n One application of  GRACE  data is to monitor the seasonal rainfall in speci fi c \nareas. For example, Tapley et al.  (  2004  )  report the Amazon Basin had a higher grav-\nity in April and May of 2003 than what it had been 3 months earlier. This is \nundoubtedly caused by the large amount of rainwater that accumulated. See \nFig.  3.15 . The red and reddish pink areas have higher than normal gravity because \nof excess water.  \n\n  Fig. 3.14.    The GRACE satellites are initially \u00d7    km apart. As the leading GRACE satellite  A  approaches an area with extra water, it accelerates \nmore than the trailing satellite  B . This causes the satellites to be X + ?x km apart. Scientists use the change in distance to determine the extra \ngravitational acceleration and, hence, the mass change (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n103\n\nEa\nrt\n\nh\n O\n\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\na\nn\nd\n W\n\nea\nth\n\ner\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n\n Scientists have used  GRACE  data to monitor aquifers. Aquifers are large bodies \nof water that lie underground. Rodell et al.  (  2009  )  report that  GRACE  detected a \ndrop in Earth\u2019s gravity in northern India. After ruling out other factors such as \nirregularities in average annual rainfall, they report groundwater depletion is the \nbest explanation for the gravity drop. The  GRACE  data are consistent with a loss of \n109 cubic km of groundwater between 2002 and 2008. See Fig.  3.16 .  \n\n Scientists also use  GRACE  data to monitor the thickness of large ice sheets. \nFigure  3.17  shows the changes in Greenland\u2019s ice cap thickness between 2003 and \n2008. As the cap gets thinner, the gravity drops. In many areas, it is getting thinner. \nThese results are based on gravity measurements.    \n\n     ICESat \n  ICESat  is designed to measure the altitude of ice both at sea and on land, provide \naltitude measurements of clouds and yield data on vegetation. It has Global \nPositioning System equipment along with other instruments that enable scientists \nto determine its exact position. It also has a 1-m telescope along with lasers that \nemit light with wavelengths of 532 and 1,064 nm. The 1,064 nm light is for sea and \nland ice, whereas the 532 nm light is for atmospheric features. When sea ice is the \ntarget, the satellite emits pulses of 1,064 nm laser light. It strikes the ice and the \nsignal bounces back. The telescope detects the return signal. With exact return \ntimes, scientists can compute the distance between  ICESat  and the ice. By knowing \n\n  Fig. 3.15.    A false color image showing the amount of water in the Amazon basin in South America. The  pink  and  red area  shows an excess \nof water.

Repeated measurements improve this accuracy. \n\n Two events that limit  ICESat  are thin clouds and snowfall. For example, Yang \net al.  (  2010  )  point out that thin clouds may affect the 1,064 nm laser data by several \ncentimeters. A second factor that may affect  ICESat  data is snowfall. This is because \nthe laser light bounces off the top of the ice/snow layer. If a lower-than-average \namount of snow has fallen, the data would show the altitude of the ice dropping \neven when the ice altitude is the same. See Fig.  3.18 .  \n\n Farrell et al.  (  2009  )  carried out a study of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean between \n2003 and 2008. These three used ICESat laser altimetry data to measure the altitude \nof sea ice. They report the altitude dropped by 1\u20132 cm per year. These scientists \nbelieve snowfall may have affected the results.  \n\n  Fig. 3.17.

It has \nan accuracy of 0.01%, and after repeated measurements, the accuracy improves. \nIt detects small changes in solar output. TIM instruments on previous satellites \ncollected the data plotted in Fig.  3.8 . The other three instruments on the  SORCE  \nsatellite measure the amount of solar energy being emitted at speci fi c wavelengths. \nScientists are interested in learning how the different wavelengths of sunlight \naffect our climate. \n\n Rottman et al.  (  2005  )  report preliminary  SORCE  data taken in July and August of \n2004. During this time, the total solar output changed by about 0.1%. The change in \nultraviolet light with a wavelength of 280 nm was even higher at 0.3% in July 2004. \n\n     Aura \n\n The  Aura  satellite detects trace quantities of ozone, methane, water vapor, hydrogen \ncyanide (HCN) and other gases in our atmosphere. Its four instruments are the \nHigh-Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS); the Microwave Limb Sounder \n(MLS); the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Tropospheric Emission \nSpectrometer (TES). These will help answer several questions such as: (1) Is the \namount of stratospheric ozone continuing to decline? (2) What role does the Sun\u2019s \nultraviolet emission play in stratospheric ozone levels? (3) Are the amounts of \ngreenhouse gases, such as water vapor and methane, continuing to rise? A green-\nhouse gas is one that is transparent to visible light but is opaque to infrared radia-\ntion with wavelengths of around 10  m m. Essentially, these gases trap heat much like \na greenhouse. \n\n Before we discuss the  Aura  satellite, we will present some facts about ozone. \n Ozone is a form of oxygen. The oxygen we breathe contains two oxygen atoms \n\nand is written as O 2 . A molecule of ozone contains three oxygen atoms and is writ-\nten as O 3 . We need molecular oxygen to survive, but ozone is a poison. However, \nozone is also bene fi cial because it absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation. Two ozone \nlayers exist. One lies near the surface of Earth and the other lies in the stratosphere. \n\n  Fig. 3.18.    The amount of snowfall may affect the  ICESat  results. A heavy snowfall means a higher snow level, as is shown on the  left . A low \nsnowfall causes a lower level, as is shown on the  right . The ice level is the same in both frames. Therefore, a low snowfall may lead to a greater distance \nbetween the satellite and the ice. This is because  ICESat  only measures the distance to the top of the snow level (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n106\n\nEa\nrt\n\nh\n O\n\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\na\nn\nd\n W\n\nea\nth\n\ner\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n\nSee Fig.  3.19 . The layer near the ground is called tropospheric ozone and the other \none is called stratospheric ozone. Tropospheric ozone is harmful, and it arises \nfrom a combination vehicle traf fi c and the burning of coal and other combustible \nmaterials. Stratospheric ozone, however, is bene fi cial because it absorbs harmful \nultraviolet radiation.  \n\n The biggest danger to humans is the destruction of the stratospheric ozone \nlayer. Without it, more destructive ultraviolet radiation will reach the surface. \nDuring the 1980s, this layer was deteriorating rapidly. Most scientists believe this \nwas caused by the emission of chloro fl uorocarbons. During this time, limits were \nplaced on these compounds. One of the goals of the  Aura  satellite is to monitor the \namount of stratospheric ozone. \n\n The amount of solar ultraviolet radiation also affects this layer. Haigh et al. \n (  2010  )  report a drop in solar ultraviolet radiation may have caused a drop in strat-\nospheric ozone below 45 km but caused an increase in this gas at higher altitudes. \nThis group used data from the  SORCE  satellite to monitor solar ultraviolet emission \nand used  Aura  data to reach this conclusion. In addition to ozone, the  Aura  satellite \nmonitored an isotope of water. \n\n Figure  3.20  illustrates the amount of HDO measured by  Aura  on January 6, 2006. \nHDO is an isotope of water. It has a deuterium atom in place of hydrogen. The deple-\ntion is greatest near Labrador and northeastern Quebec, Canada, and at altitudes \nabove 6 km. This compound is used to trace the history of water vapor in our atmos-\nphere. As it turns out, water is about 0.03% HDO. When it rains, HDO is more likely \nto fall than H 2 O. As a result, the amount of HDO in the atmosphere will be lower than \n0.03% after a rainstorm. Therefore, the drop near Labrador and northeastern Quebec \nin this illustration is probably caused by large amounts of precipitation.   \n\n     Calipso \n\n  The Cloud, Aerosol, Lidar and Infrared Path fi nder Satellite Observation (Calipso)  is \na French-American satellite designed to study clouds and aerosols. It will enable \n\n  Fig. 3.19.    The tropospheric ozone layer lies in the troposphere and the stratospheric ozone layer lies in the stratosphere. The  dashed line  is the \nboundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n107\n\nEa\nrt\n\nh\n O\n\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\na\nn\nd\n W\n\nea\nth\n\ner\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n\nscientists to take measurements on two or more layers of clouds and to determine \nhow thick aerosol layers are. Scientists are especially interested in learning how \nclouds and aerosols affect the temperature.  Calipso  contains a 1-m telescope along \nwith visible and infrared imagers and a lidar. The lidar illuminates clouds and \naerosols with polarized laser light and then detects the re fl ected and scattered \nlight. When the signal interacts with the atmosphere, the polarization changes, and \nit is this change that may yield information about the particles making up clouds \nand aerosols. The laser has wavelengths of 532 and 1,064 nm.  \n\n     Cloudsat \n\n Clouds re fl ect sunlight. They cause less sunlight to reach the surface and, hence, \nlead to cooler daytime temperatures. At night, clouds prevent heat from escaping, \ncausing temperatures to remain high. To make matters more complicated, the \nthickness of clouds affects how much light makes it to the surface or how much \nheat is trapped. In short, clouds affect our temperature. The  Cloudsat  satellite is \ndesigned to study the frequency, distribution, structure and radiative properties of \nclouds. It contains a 94 GHz radar instrument that directs radar downwards. The \nradar bounces off clouds, and scientists use the return signal to learn more about \ntheir distribution and thickness. In many cases, data from this satellite is used with \nthose from others to determine how clouds affect local conditions. The vertical \nresolution of the radar instrument is 0.5 km or 0.3 miles. The spatial resolution is \n1.4 by 1.7 km, which is about a square mile.  \n\n  Fig. 3.20.    A graph illustrating the concentration of the water isotope HDO across the path  Aura  followed. The  Aura  satellite recorded this \ndata on January 6, 2006. The HDO concentrations will help scientists learn more about the water cycle and its effect on weather and climate. \nNote that the longitude is measured eastward from the Prime Meridian. Therefore, 240\u00b0 longitude in this diagram equals 120\u00b0W longitude (Credit: \nNASA/JPL-Caltech).       \n\n \n\n\n\n108\n\nEa\nrt\n\nh\n O\n\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\na\nn\nd\n W\n\nea\nth\n\ner\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n     Other Earth-Observing Satellites \n\n Many more Earth-observing satellites are in operation than those listed in \nTable  3.1 . Many of these have speci fi c functions. A group of satellites designed to \nstudy the Earth\u2019s land masses is summarized in Table  3.3 . Tables  3.4  and  3.5  list \nseveral Earth observing satellites operated by the European Space Agency and \ntheir partners.      \n\n     Weather Satellites \n The weather is the state of the atmosphere at a speci fi c time and place. This \nincludes the temperature, pressure, relative humidity, winds, cloud cover and so \nforth. Climate is different. It is the average weather condition for many years at a \nlocation (   Gove,  1971 ). Satellites whose primary purpose is to collect data on our \nweather are called weather satellites. They provide nearly continuous data on the \nstate of our atmosphere. Several countries operate them. See Tables  3.6  and  3.7 .   \n\n In recent years, our dependence on satellites, large power grids and pipelines \nmeans that forecasts of space weather are also vital.

These are listed in Table  3.7 . The National \nWeather Service uses data from these to issue weather forecasts. Many of these \ninclude severe weather warnings. They also monitor space weather. \n\n The  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)  monitor weather \nin the United States and surrounding areas. They are in a geostationary orbit, and \nhence, move at the same rate as Earth. They remain above nearly the same location. \nMore than one satellite is needed to monitor weather across the United States. \nMuch of the information on this satellite is from Space Systems-Loral, Reference \n#S-415-19 (GOES I-M Data Book), which is on the website   http://goes.gsfc.nasa.\ngov/text/goes.databook.html    . \n\n Figure  3.21  shows the dimensions of the  GOES  satellite. Its solar array has a total \nsurface area of 12.7 m 2 . It produces between 1,050 and 1,300 W of power depending \non the season. The solar array charges up the nickel-cadmium batteries. A solar sail \nis at the other end. It balances the radiation pressure exerted on the solar array. \nThis helps keep the satellite oriented properly.  GOES  is about as long as two school \nbuses. The central box is around 2.4 m across, which is about the size of a large golf \ncart. It contains the imager, sounder, high-energy particle detectors, and an X-ray \nimager. A brief description of the scienti fi c instruments follows.  \n\n The imager collects data on cloud altitude, sea surface temperature, the amount \nof water vapor in the atmosphere and cloud cover during both the day and night. \nThese characteristics control our weather. The imager has a 0.311 m Cassegrain \ntelescope. The imager uses  fi ve different  fi lters that de fi ne the  fi ve channels. \nIt records an image of the entire Earth or part of it.

Therefore, meteorologists use it to focus on a rapidly \ndeveloping storm. The imager plays an important role in weather forecasting; how-\never, data from the sounder also provides vital data. \n\n The sounder yields information on the vertical pro fi le of our atmosphere. It \nmeasures how the temperature, ozone and water vapor levels change at different \naltitudes. This instrument also measures cloud temperatures. The sounder is able \nto do this through its 19 different channels. Each one uses a special narrow-band \n fi lter which is sensitive to either red or near-infrared wavelengths. This instrument \nis able to image the entire Earth or a small part of it. \n\n Some factors that may affect space weather include solar  fl ares, geomagnetic \nstorms and bursts of high-energy particles slamming into our atmosphere. These \ncould wreck havoc. For example, rapid changes in our magnetic  fi eld may create \nunwanted electrical currents in a power grid or a pipeline.

It \ncontains three chapters. This chapter describes how to observe arti fi cial satellites. \nThe next one describes images of satellites and research projects involving satellite \nobservations. Chapter   6     gives a mathematical description of how one may compute \neclipse times of objects in a geostationary orbit. \n\n Arti fi cial objects in space range in brightness from that of a crescent Moon \ndown to the faintest objects imaged at professional observatories. Many satellites \nare bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye. These include the International \nSpace Station, the Hubble Space Telescope, some pieces of space junk and many of \nthe satellites described in Chap.   3    . Space junk includes broken satellites, spent \nrocket boosters and fragments from rockets and satellites. Other satellites such as \nthose in geostationary orbit will almost always require optical aid. \n\n We will describe two classes of satellites, those that have low orbits and those \nwith geostationary orbits. Those in low orbits have altitudes below 1,600 km. Those \nin geostationary orbits have altitudes of around 35,800 km. \n\n This chapter is broken into  fi ve major sections. The  fi rst one describes how and \nwhere to look for low-orbit and geostationary satellites. We will also explore the \ngeometry of satellites, a useful website and the author\u2019s sky brightness measure-\nments. The second section gives a description of how to observe these objects. The \nbrightness and standard magnitude of a satellite is described in the third. In the \nlast two sections, you will learn about the author\u2019s observations of low-orbit and \ngeostationary satellites.  \n\n   Looking for Satellites \n Unlike stars and planets, the right ascension and declination of a satellite may \nchange by several degrees in just a few minutes. For this reason, different tech-\nniques should be used to look for these objects. You will learn how to identify and \nlook for low-orbit and geostationary satellites in this section. \n\nR.

Most of them move \n0.4\u20131.0\u00b0/s or the length of a fully extended  fi st in 10\u201325 s. They usually remain vis-\nible for at least 30 s. They drift silently across the sky and do not leave a vapor trail. \nSatellites following nearly polar orbits often have a nearly constant brightness. Those \nmoving from west to east (or east to west) will grow brighter or dimmer as a result \nof a changing phase. A few also tumble and, hence, undergo rapid brightness \nchanges. One may confuse a plane, shooting star, balloon, bright star or planet for \na satellite. Characteristics of these objects are summarized in Table  4.1 . Let\u2019s review \nobjects that may be confused for satellites.  \n\n The jet plane is a common object in many areas. In most cases it has one or more \n fl ashing red lights. They  fl ash about once a second. Jet planes almost always have \ntwo or more lights that may be resolved with the eye or binoculars. All satellites, \n\n   Table 4.1.

In a few cases, such as when a jet is  moving \ndirectly towards you, it appears as a single bright object. After a few seconds, its \ndirection changes and the  fl ashing red lights appear. \n\n One can mistake a bright star or planet for a satellite during twilight. This is \nbecause almost no stars are visible at this time. The best approach in this situation \nis to keep track of it for at least 30 s. If the suspected object is a satellite, it should \nmove the length of one to three fully extended  fi sts. It is also helpful to know the \npositions of the brightest stars and planets during twilight. The magazine  Sky & \nTelescope  is an excellent source for identifying these objects. Another device that \nmay be useful is a planisphere. It shows approximate positions of stars and planets \nat any time of the year. \n\n Shooting stars and balloons may be mistaken for satellites. Shooting stars \nstreak across the sky. They typically move at least 20\u00b0/s and are visible for less \nthan 2 s. You might typically observe a bright circular object at around sunset. \nUpon closer inspection with binoculars, it may turn out to be a balloon. A satellite, \non the other hand, is too far away to show a shape through binoculars. One may \nalso distinguish between a balloon and a satellite by looking for movement. Over \na period of 30 s, a satellite should move at least 10\u00b0 whereas a distant balloon will \nhardly move.  \n\n   Geostationary Satellites \n\n Geostationary satellites are dimmer than many of those in low orbits. This is \nbecause they are farther away. They move in tiny ellipses high above Earth. See \nFig.  4.1 . Since they move just a little, they remain at nearly the same position at \n\n  Fig. 4.1.

One may observe them with a telescope having a  fi eld-of-view of about \n1.0\u00b0. This is twice the angular size of the Moon. When you  fi nd a geostationary \nsatellite in the telescope it will remain in nearly the same position with respect \nto the eyepiece  fi eld. At this point, turn off the telescope drive. Stars near it will \ndrift by.  \n\n These satellites often change in brightness. In one case,  Echostar 15  reached the \nthreshold of unaided-eye visibility (magnitude 6). This was on October 4, 2011, at \n2:22 UT. After about 15 min, its brightness fell by a factor of four. Specular re fl ection \nprobably caused this brightening. \n\n Geostationary satellite eclipses occur about 1% of the time. These events may \nyield valuable data on Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Eclipses are discussed in Chaps.   5     and   6    .  \n\n   When to Look for Satellites \n\n One may observe geostationary satellites at any time during the night. They can \neven be observed with nearby streetlights and a waxing gibbous Moon. In the \ncase of viewing low-orbit satellites with the unaided eye, the situation is differ-\nent. Dark skies are needed. In this section, you will  fi rst learn about the geometry \nfor viewing satellites. Next, you will learn about a useful website and sky bright-\nness. Afterwards, you will learn when to observe low-orbit and geostationary \nsatellites.  \n\n   Geometry for Viewing Satellites \n\n Like the Moon, arti fi cial satellites re fl ect light. They do this in one of two modes, \nnamely diffuse and specular. Both modes are described in Chap.   1    . In most cases, \ndiffuse re fl ection is dominant. Because of this, we will  fi rst learn about the observing \ngeometry and satellite phase. \n\n A low-orbit satellite is best seen during the night. Therefore, it should be high \nenough to be in sunlight but, at the same time, the observer should be in darkness. \nSee Fig.  4.2 . In this drawing, the sky is dark because the observer lies far enough \ninto Earth\u2019s umbra. At the same time, the satellite is above Earth\u2019s shadow and, \nhence, re fl ects light. The dashed line in Fig.  4.3  is the observer\u2019s horizon. The Sun \nis 20\u00b0 below the horizon and, hence, its altitude is ?20\u00b0. In this situation, the \nobserver would see a dark sky.   \n\n Satellites are brightest when they have a large phase and are at the zenith. \nAtmospheric extinction will cause objects near the horizon to grow dim. Figure  4.4  \nshows the brightness drop (in stellar magnitudes) for an elevation of 250 m and \nfor Los Alamos, New Mexico (elevation 2,200 m). You should look at least 30\u00b0 \nabove the horizon near sea level. For those at a high altitude, look at least 15\u00b0 \nabove the horizon. The satellite phase is also critical. In the late evening, look to \nthe east. Before sunrise, look to the west. This is because objects are brightest \nwhen they are nearly opposite from the Sun. At this position their phase is larger. \nThe phase is the fraction of an object that sunlight illuminates as seen by the \nobserver. See Fig.  4.5 . A satellite with a large phase will be much brighter than \none with a small phase.   \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_6\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_1\n\n\n117\n\nO\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\na\nl \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n\n  Fig. 4.2.

The difference between the drawings is the location of the \nobserver in relation to the direction of sunlight. In Fig.  4.6 , the observer is in three \ndifferent locations and, hence, sees three different phases. In the top drawing, \nthe solar phase angle, which is the angle between the observer and the Sun measured \nfrom the object\u2019s center, is 30\u00b0. Therefore, the observer sees a phase of 0.93. When \nthe solar phase angle is 90\u00b0 the observer sees a phase of 0.50, and when it is 150\u00b0 \nthe observer sees a phase of 0.07. As the solar phase angle increases, the phase \ndecreases. Our Moon behaves in the same way. It is brightest at full phase. This is \nbecause the entire lit side of the Moon faces us and the dark half faces away. \nFigure  4.7  shows the relative V- fi lter brightness of the Moon from new to full phase. \nThe Moon is over 100 times brighter with a phase of 0.93 than with one of 0.07. \nIn the same way, a satellite is brighter at a full than at a new phase.    \n\n   A Useful Website \n\n One website,   http://www.heavens-above.com/?    , lists predicted positions for satel-\nlites each night. In order to properly use it, the location of the observing site \nshould be entered correctly. Use the \u201cedit manually\u201d key in the con fi guration sec-\ntion near the top of the page. Once the edit manually button is clicked, the pro-\ngram will ask for  fi ve characteristics of the observing site, namely latitude, \nlongitude, elevation above sea level, location name and time zone. You will learn \nabout each of these. \n\n The latitude should be entered to the nearest 0.01\u00b0. One may use a Global \nPositioning device or a program like the free site:   http://www.itouchmap.com/\nlatlong.html     to determine latitude. One should also enter it in decimal degrees. \nIf the latitude is given in degrees, minutes and seconds it should be converted to \ndegrees. Latitudes south of the equator are negative, whereas those north of it are \npositive. \n\n  Fig. 4.5.    The relationship between the phase and the solar phase angle for a spherical object. As the solar phase angle increases, the phase \ndecreases. The solar phase angle is the angle between the Sun and the observer measured from the object.

It is entered \nto the nearest 0.01\u00b0 in decimal degrees. All longitudes west of the Prime Meridian \nare negative, whereas those east of it are positive. The continental United States is \nwest of the Prime Meridian and, hence, longitudes are negative. \n\n The elevation of the observing site is entered in meters above sea level. Elevations \nmay be obtained from Google Earth or from an atlas. One should divide an eleva-\ntion given in feet by 3.28 to convert it to meters. \n\n The location of the observing site should be entered. This is not critical. If the \nsite does not have a name, type in the nearest town or post of fi ce. \n\n The time zone should be selected from a list. Without this information, the times \nwill make no sense. The program automatically corrects for both Daylight Savings \nTime and British Summer Time. Once all information is entered, one may obtain \npredictions on many types of satellites including the International Space Station, \nIridium  fl ares and the Hubble Space Telescope. \n\n The printout gives several pieces of information that include the name of the \nsatellite, the time and location of it at maximum altitude and its brightness in stellar \nmagnitudes. Let\u2019s discuss brightness and location. \n\n  Fig. 4.6.    The Sun illuminates about half of a spherical object. The phase, however, depends on the observer\u2019s position. The phase increases as \nthe angle between the observer and the sunlight decreases (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n120\n\nO\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\na\nl \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n\n The brightness of stars is measured in stellar magnitudes. Bright stars like Vega \nand Arcturus have a magnitude of zero, whereas those barely visible to the unaided \neye in a dark sky have a magnitude of 6. The larger the star\u2019s magnitude value, the \nfainter it is. Essentially, a star of magnitude 3.0 is 2.512 times brighter than one of \nmagnitude 4.0. \n\n The satellite\u2019s position is given in the altitude-azimuth system instead of the \nright ascension-declination system. One device that may yield accurate altitudes is \nthe quadrant. Figure  4.8  shows a drawing of how to put it together. One attaches a \nprotractor to a block of wood and then attaches string to the protractor\u2019s center. \nThe other end of the string has a weight. A 0.25 m piece of \u00bd in. PVC pipe is placed \non top. The string and weight always point straight down. Therefore, when the \nquadrant is held level, one should see the horizon and the string should line up \nwith 0\u00b0. When one aims the quadrant at the zenith, the string should line up with \n90\u00b0. Figure  4.9  shows a quadrant.   \n\n The azimuth describes the direction. Azimuth is measured from 0\u00b0 up to 360\u00b0. \nThe respective azimuth values of north, east, south and west are 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0 and \n270\u00b0. Figure  4.10  shows abbreviations for different directions. For example, NNW \nstands for north northwest, and it is three-fourths the way from west to north. \nIts azimuth value is 337.5\u00b0. One may estimate the azimuth using a compass, the \nlocation of the North Star or binoculars with a compass. One should correct for \nmagnetic declination when using a compass. This is because a compass needle \npoints to the magnetic pole instead of true north. Figure  4.11  illustrates magnetic \ndeclination. For the eastern half of the United States, the compass needle points a \nlittle to the left of true north. For the western half of the country, the needle points \nin the other direction. One may determine the magnetic declination for their location \nat   http://www.magnetic-declination.com/    .   \n\n  Fig. 4.7.    This graph shows the relative brightness of the Moon from new to full phase. At a phase of 0.93, the relative brightness is 4,300, \nwhereas it is less than 40 at a phase of 0.07. These results are based on the author\u2019s V- fi lter measurements. See  Journal of the Royal Astronomical \nSociety,  volume 95, p. 20, 2001. The solar phase angle is also shown on the  bottom axis  (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\nhttp://www.magnetic-declination.com/\n\n\n121\n\nO\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\na\nl \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n The best way to estimate a satellite\u2019s location is to  fi nd a bright object near the \n\nsame altitude as the predicted satellite position. You use a quadrant to measure \naltitudes of potential objects until a suitable one is found. You may use the North \nStar or a compass to get the correct direction.  \n\n   Sky Brightness Measurements \n\n The sky brightness is critical for observing satellites with the unaided eye. More \nsatellites will be visible in a darker sky than in a brighter one. For this reason, \nwe need to learn about the sky brightness measurements. \n\n  Fig. 4.8.    This drawing shows the major parts of a quadrant. The protractor and PVC pipe are glued or taped to the wood block (Credit: Richard \nSchmude, Jr.).       \n\n  Fig. 4.9.

It grew darker as the Sun sank \nbelow the horizon. By 19:00 (7:00 pm) local time the sky was as dark as it got for \nthe night. Figure  4.13  shows a graph of sky brightness versus the Sun elevation. At \nsunset, the sky brightness was about magnitude 7.5 per square arc second. This is \nequivalent to the light coming from a 7.5 magnitude star spread over each square \narc second of the sky. When the Sun was 14\u00b0 below the horizon (?14\u00b0) the sky \nbrightness had dropped to magnitude 19.7 per square arc second. It remained near \nthis value until the next morning. Therefore, once the Sun elevation drops to ?14\u00b0, \nconditions are optimum for satellite observation.   \n\n During which month is the moonless sky darkest? To answer this question, the \nauthor measured the sky brightness 170 times from his backyard between August \n2009 and July 2011. All measurements were made at zenith. The Moon was probably \nbelow the horizon for all measurements. The monthly average sky brightness \nvalues are plotted in Fig.  4.14 . For my backyard, the sky has nearly the same bright-\nness throughout the year. Therefore, all months in my area have nearly the same \nsky brightness.   \n\n  Fig. 4.10.

In New York, the compass needle points 13.2\u00b0 to the left of true north. In Los Angeles, the \ncompass needle points 12.6\u00b0 to the right of true north. These values are for 2011. The magnetic declination changes, and, hence, observers should \ncheck it for their location every 4 or 5 years.

Figure  4.15  \nshows the number of low-orbit satellites predicted to be visible between July 1 and \n10, 2011. All data are for Barnesville, Georgia. All predictions are based on data \nfrom the website:   http://www.heavens-above.com/?     The writer believes the data in \nFig.  4.15  show a typical distribution for summer months in the continental United \nStates. According to this  fi gure, the largest number of satellites is visible between \n22:00 and 23:30 and between 4:00 and 5:30 local time. The times depend on the \nseason. A better indicator of satellite visibility is the Sun\u2019s altitude. Most satellites \nare visible when the Sun is less than 26\u00b0 below the horizon. Accordingly, one will \nhave the best chance of seeing them when the Sun is between 14\u00b0 and 26\u00b0 below the \nhorizon. The lower limit in this range is from sky brightness and the upper limit is \nfrom the trend in Fig.  4.15 .  \n\n Table  4.2  shows the best times to observe low-orbit satellites for different lati-\ntudes. It lists the number of minutes after sunset (or before sunrise) when the Sun \nis between 14\u00b0 and 26\u00b0 below the horizon. To use the table, one would look up his or \nher latitude and select the closest one. Look up the time of sunset for your area and \nadd the values in Table  4.2  to determine the best time interval to look for them. \nThe values are subtracted from the time of sunrise for early morning viewing. For \nexample, the Sun sets at 8:40 pm on July 16 in Atlanta, Georgia. Since Atlanta is at \n34\u00b0 N, one uses the 34\u00b0 column and matches it up with the mid-July row. The best \ntime in the evening is 56\u2013164 min after 8:40 pm or 9:36 pm to 11:24 pm. As a second \nexample, an observer in Austin, Texas, wants to observe before sunrise during mid-\nJuly. The Sun rises at 6:40 am. Since Austin is at 30\u00b0 N, one would use the 30\u00b0 column. \nThe best time to observe is 149\u201353 min before sunrise or from 4:11 am to 5:47 am. \nFor latitudes not listed in Table  4.2 , select the one closest to where you live.   \n\n  Fig. 4.15.

Therefore, they are best seen in the dark \nsky. For most of the year, they do not move into Earth\u2019s shadow. On dates within \nabout 23\u201324 days of equinox (March or September), they move into Earth\u2019s shadow \nat a certain time. Essentially, they are in eclipse. This is described in Chaps.   5     and   6    . \nThe best time to observe these objects is when they are nearly opposite from our \nSun. Therefore, on dates that are more than 23\u201324 days from equinox, select a \nsatellite opposite from our Sun. Look for an object that has a right ascension \neither 12 h higher or 12 h lower than that of our Sun. When observing near equi-\nnox, select a target that has a right ascension either 11 h higher or 11 h lower than \nthat of our Sun.  \n\n   Observing Iridium Flares \n\n An Iridium  fl are is a fascinating event to watch. It occurs when a satellite mirror \nre fl ects light to the observer. Essentially, specular re fl ection occurs. In some cases, \nthe satellite will get as bright as magnitude ?8 or ?9, which is much brighter than \nthe International Space Station. Therefore, even though the ISS has over 100 times \nthe surface area of an Iridium satellite, the latter may be much brighter. \n\n Figure  4.16  shows a small portion of middle Georgia. The dashed line represents \nan area where the specular re fl ection of  Iridium 65  was predicted to be greatest on \nJuly 7, 2011. Essentially, this is where the mirror angle equals 0.0\u00b0. The closer one is \nto the dashed line; the brighter will be the predicted  fl ash. Table  4.3  lists the pre-\ndicted  fl ash characteristics for positions A through F. In Fig.  4.16 , point B has the \nsmallest \u201cdistance to the  fl are center\u201d value. Consequently, the  fl are was predicted \nto be brighter at that point than at the others.

This is the shortest distance between \nthe imputed coordinates and the path of maximum brightness.  \n\n   Satellite Standard Magnitude \n\n According to Taylor  (  1990  )  the standard magnitude (or intrinsic brightness) of \na satellite is its brightness, in stellar magnitudes, at a distance of 1,000 km at \nhalf phase.

Satellites \nare like our Moon. As discussed earlier, the closer a satellite is to full phase, the \nbrighter it will be. \n\n Arti fi cial satellites are much closer than our Moon. For example, the  Terra  satel-\nlite is only 700 km above Earth\u2019s surface, whereas the corresponding value for our \nMoon is 380,000 km. The maximum phase that  Terra  may reach depends on several \nfactors. The phase reaches 1.00 at sunset and at a satellite altitude of 0\u00b0. These are \nunrealistic observing conditions. If one is in darkness (Sun altitude of ?14\u00b0) and \n Terra\u2019s  altitude is 23\u00b0 its phase would equal 0.99. See Fig.  4.17 . The Moon\u2019s phase, \non the other hand, may reach 0.9997 in total darkness before it enters Earth\u2019s \nshadow. The geometry of the Moon\u2019s orbit and Earth\u2019s shadow is shown in \nFig.  4.18 .   \n\n A satellite\u2019s brightness depends on several factors, including albedo, distance, size \nand standard magnitude. The albedo expresses the fraction of light that an object \nre fl ects. For example fresh snow re fl ects a greater percentage of light than a piece of \ncoal. Therefore, snow has a higher albedo than coal. A satellite with a high albedo \nwill be brighter than one with a low albedo. The closer and larger a satellite is, the more \nlight it will re fl ect. Finally, a satellite with a bright standard magnitude will usually \nbe brighter than one with a dim standard magnitude. Table  4.4  lists the standard \nmagnitudes of a few satellites. The values in Table  4.4  do not include spurious \nspecular re fl ection that may occur. In the case of the ISS, brightness values are based \n\n  Fig. 4.17.    The geometry of the  Terra  satellite at the low solar phase angle of 9\u00b0. Note that the observer has just moved into  darkness , and \n Terra  is just above Earth\u2019s shadow.

When the Moon is just outside Earth\u2019s shadow, its solar phase angle is 2\u00b0 \nand its phase is 0.9997 (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n128\n\nO\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\na\nl \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n\non an orbit with a ground distance of 380 km. The altitude of the ISS changes \nbecause of gas drag and periodic boosts. For example, according to   http://www.\nheavens-above.com/?    , the altitude of the ISS was 346 km on May 1, 2011, but after a \nboost in June, its altitude was 389 km on July 1, 2011.   \n\n   Brightness of Amazonas 2 \n\n In this section, some measurements of  Amazonas 2  made on October 15 from 2:16 \nto 3:28 Universal Time will be given. Equation  4.1  shows the relationship between \nthe brightness and the solar phase angle ( a ) for this satellite.\n\n     ( ) [ ]+ a \u00b0 < a < \u00b0Vvis stellar magnitudes = 7.0 0.11 10.2 25.5    (4.1)   \n\n In this equation, Vvis is the brightness of  Amazonas 2  based on eye estimates \nand  a  is the solar phase angle in degrees. This equation is only valid for solar phase \nangles between 10.2\u00b0 and 25.5\u00b0. When  a  drops below 9\u00b0, Earth will eclipse it. \nTherefore, this satellite attains a brightness of 8th magnitude just before it enters \nEarth\u2019s shadow. It grows about one stellar magnitude dimmer per 9\u00b0 increase of  a . \nThe large value of 0.11 before  a  indicates that Eq.  4.1  describes specular re fl ection. \nIn the case of diffuse re fl ection, the term before  a  would be close to 0.01. This is \ndescribed further at the end of Chap.   5    .  \n\n   Brightness of Low-Orbit Satellites \n\n Low-orbit satellites have a wide range of solar phase angles. This undoubtedly \nleads to a wide range of brightness values. Figure  4.19  shows the distribution of \npredicted satellite brightness values for July 1 through 10, 2011. Only those equal \nto or brighter than magnitude 4.5 are included. Most of them are fainter than mag-\nnitude 3.5. There is a chance that several of these have grown dimmer over time. \nThis is described further in Chap.   5    .    \n\n   Table 4.4.    Standard magnitude of selected satellites.

Predicted satellite positions were not consulted. Over a \nperiod of 38.2 h, 178 satellites were observed with the unaided eye. Results are \nsummarized in Fig.  4.20 .  \n\n The upper left graph in the  fi gure shows the number of satellites observed for \ndifferent Sun altitudes. In all cases the Sun was below the horizon. Since some \nobservations were cut off for a variety of reasons a normalization procedure was \nused. Essentially, First the Sun altitude for each observed satellite was computed. \nThe satellites were grouped into different categories of the Sun altitude. Afterwards, \nsomething called \u201cthe number of degrees\u201d was computed. So, if observations were \ncarried out over 10 days and the sky was observed at all times when the Sun had an \nelevation between ?14\u00b0 and ?16\u00b0 the number of degrees would be 10 \u00d7 2\u00b0 = 20\u00b0 for \nthe ?14\u00b0 to ?16\u00b0 interval. If, on the other hand, observations were made on just 3 \ndays when the Sun had an altitude between ?26\u00b0 and ?28\u00b0 the total number of \ndegrees would be 3 \u00d7 2\u00b0 = 6\u00b0 for the ?26\u00b0 to ?28\u00b0 interval. The number of satellites \nfor each Sun elevation interval was divided by the number of degrees. The end \nresults were plotted. According to this  fi gure, more satellites are seen when the Sun \nis between 12\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 below the horizon than for other Sun positions. \n\n The graph in the upper right shows the direction of satellite movement. The \nobserved satellites are placed into one of four groups: North to South, South to \nNorth, East to West and West to East. The most common movement was South to \nNorth. The least common was East to West. This is because it is harder to launch a \nsatellite in this direction. Essentially, one is working against the rotation of Earth. \nThis is discussed further in Fig.   1.17     and the related text in Chap.   1    . \n\n The peak brightness of satellites in stellar magnitudes was also estimated. The \nresults are shown in the graph in the lower left. Most satellites observed had a \nbrightness of between magnitude 2 and 4. On most of the dates, the limiting \nmagnitude was around 5.5. Therefore, fainter satellites were not included. \n\n  Fig. 4.19.    The number of satellites at different brightness levels. All satellites predicted to be visible from Barnesville, Georgia, between July \n1 and 10, 2011, are included (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_1\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_1\n\n\n130\n\nO\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\na\nl \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n\n When is the best time to observe satellites with no knowledge of when and \nwhere to look? To help answer this question, you can measure the sky brightness \nwith a Sky Quality Meter during the  fi rst few seconds after initially seeing a satel-\nlite. The percentage of satellites observed for different sky brightness values are \nplotted in the lower right of Fig.  4.20 . The darkest sky for the data in the  fi gure was \nmagnitude 20.7 per square arc second. Over half of the satellites observed had a \nsky brightness value fainter than magnitude 20.0 per square arc second. Therefore, \nto answer the question of when to look, the best times are illustrated in Table  4.2 .  \n\n   Observations of Geostationary \nSatellites \n Geostationary satellites require different observing techniques. As mentioned \nearlier, they move at the same rate as Earth\u2019s rotation. They do not rise or set. One \nshould use a telescope or large binoculars to observe them. A clock drive should \nnot be used. Table  4.5  lists a few of them along with their standard magnitude \n\n  Fig. 4.20.    All results are based on observations between April and June of 2011. The author observed 178 satellites with the unaided eye for \n38.2 h. During this time, predicted times and locations of satellites were not used. Results are in four graphs. The  upper left graph  shows the number \nof satellites observed divided by the total degrees observed. The total degrees observed had to be used since observing was stopped early on some \ndates. For example, if you were to observe for 5 days and watch the sky the entire time when the Sun is 14\u201316\u00b0 below the horizon, the total degrees \nwould equal 5\u00b0 \u00d7 2\u00b0 = 10\u00b0. The  upper right  graph shows the distribution of satellites moving in the four different directions. The  lower left  graph \nshows the number of satellites observed versus peak brightness. The  lower right  graph shows the percentage of satellites  fi rst detected for different \nvalues of the sky brightness (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n131\n\nO\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\na\nl \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n\nand other characteristics. Many are visible from the continental United States, \nAlaska and Hawaii.  Turksat 3a, Hotbird 8\u201310  and  INTELSAT 25  are visible from \nthe United Kingdom.  \n\n Predicting the brightness of a satellite is like predicting how an American foot-\nball will bounce. This is because satellites have irregular shapes. Furthermore, \nspecular re fl ection may be a large percentage of re fl ected light; this is not the case \nfor the Moon or planets. Because of this, it is dif fi cult to predict the brightness of \na satellite. The author has estimated the brightness of  fi ve geostationary satellites \nat a solar phase angle of 10\u201320\u00b0. The satellites, with respective brightness values in \nstellar magnitudes in parentheses, are:  Amazonas 1  (10.6),  Amazonas 2  (7.8), \n Echostar 12  (9.9),  Echostar 3  (9.1) and  Echostar 15  (10.8). The average brightness \nchange between the standard magnitude and the one just before eclipse is 4.8 stel-\nlar magnitudes, with a standard deviation of 1.8 stellar magnitudes. Essentially, \nthis factor accounts for distance, solar phase angle and changes in specular \nre fl ection. Therefore, a satellite with a standard magnitude of 5.4 may reach a \nbrightness of magnitude 10.2 just before it enters Earth\u2019s penumbra. The uncer-\ntainty in this value is two stellar magnitudes. \n\n A geostationary satellite does not have a  fi xed right ascension. Therefore, one \nshould know where it will pass ahead of time. The website   http://www.n2yo.com/\nsatellites/?c=10     lists the current right ascension (RA) and declination ( d ) of many \nsatellites. It takes approximately 60 min of time for a geostationary satellite to \nmove 1 h of RA. A procedure for  fi nding one is illustrated in Fig.  4.21 . We will look \nat an example. Let\u2019s say you want to observe  Amazonas 2  at around 11 P.M in \nOctober. You would  fi rst look up its right ascension (RA) and declination. Let\u2019s say \n\n   Table 4.5.

Let\u2019s say that you are familiar with \na group of stars near RA = 0 h 01 m and  d  = ?5.5\u00b0. Therefore, the target will move \nacross this group at 10:51 pm. Once this is computed, you set up the telescope and \naim it on this group. You then insert a low-power eyepiece and begin looking for \nthe target a few minutes before 10:51 P.M. Once you site  Amazonas 2,  you insert a \nhigher-power eyepiece. This darkens the sky.  \n\n On some nights, you may have trouble with condensation on the eyepiece. If this \nhappens, place it near a heater, and this will eliminate the problem. \n\n Although geostationary satellites lie close to Earth\u2019s equatorial plane, they do not \nhave a declination of 0\u00b0. This is because they are closer than 45,000 km. See Fig.  4.22 . \nAn observer north of the equator will observe the satellite south of the celestial \nequator. The opposite is true for an observer in the southern hemisphere. Table  4.6  \nlists the declination of geostationary satellites for different observer latitudes.   \n\n Figure  4.23  shows Earth\u2019s shadow and nomenclature for a satellite eclipse. Earth \nhas an angular diameter of almost 18\u00b0 for geostationary satellites. In the penum-\nbra, Earth blocks part of the Sun and in the umbra, it blocks all of the Sun. The \nsame nomenclature used for lunar eclipses is used here. In Fig.  4.23  point P1 is the \npoint where the satellite  fi rst enters the penumbra. Since this object is less than \n30 m long, it takes less than 0.01 s for it to move into the penumbra. Therefore, P2 \nis at almost the same time as P1. Point U1 is the point when the satellite enters \nthe umbra and U4 is when it leaves the umbra. Point P4 is the point when it leaves \n\n  Fig. 4.21.

This drawing illustrates the penumbra and umbra portions of Earth\u2019s shadow for a geostationary satellite. The satellite moves from \nright to left along the  dashed line . Point P1 is location where the satellite enters the penumbra, and P4 is the location where it exits the penumbra. \nPoint U1 is the location where the satellite enters the umbra, and U4 is the location where it exits the umbra (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n134\n\nO\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\na\nl \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\nthe penumbra. The length of time between P1 and P4 is up to 72 min. A scale \nrepresenting the time is given in Fig.  4.23 .  \n\n Watching a satellite pass into Earth\u2019s shadow is a unique event. It starts out with \nthe satellite maintaining a nearly constant brightness. It starts to get dim once it is \nabout half-way into the penumbra. Afterwards, it dims rapidly. Once the satellite \nreaches the umbra it continues to fade without a sharp drop-off. Once it is just \ninside the umbra, it may disappear and reappear. This behavior is due to our atmos-\nphere bending light towards and away from the satellite. The data is valuable \nbecause it may help us better understand our atmosphere. At some point it becomes \ninvisible. The point that it becomes invisible depends on the limiting magnitude. \nAs an example, during one of the author\u2019s eclipse observations, the faintest stars \nvisible were near magnitude 12. Therefore, the target had fallen below this value \nonce it was deep enough into Earth\u2019s shadow. \n\n How will the brightness of a geostationary satellite change as it moves into \nEarth\u2019s shadow? To answer this question, let\u2019s look at lunar eclipses. Let\u2019s say you \nmeasured the brightness of a small area on the Moon during the January 20\u201321, \n2000, eclipse. This area\u2019s brightness fell four stellar magnitudes as it moved through \nEarth\u2019s penumbra. It dimmed an additional 4.5 stellar magnitudes from U1 to a \ndepth of 1,000 km in the umbra. Therefore, the total brightness drop was 8.5 stellar \nmagnitudes. Under similar circumstances, a geosynchronous satellite may have a \nstellar magnitude of 7.5 before it enters Earth\u2019s penumbra. If it behaves in the same \nway as the Moon did on January 20\u201321, 2000, it would drop to magnitude 11.5 near \nU1 and would drop to magnitude 16 once it is 1,000 km into the umbra. Even \nthough  Amazonas 2  entered the umbra, it was usually visible for a few seconds. \nThis is discussed further in Chap.   5    . There is one additional uncertainty, though, \nand that is the role of specular re fl ection at low solar phase angles. \n\n Geostationary satellites undergo eclipses during two 6.5-week periods each year. \nThese occur between late February and early April and again between late August \nand mid October. Eclipses happen when the Sun\u2019s declination is between 9\u00b0 N and 9\u00b0 S. \nThe path it follows depends on the Sun\u2019s declination. Figure  4.24  shows the path \n\n  Fig. 4.24.    A geostationary satellite will move through the center of Earth\u2019s shadow on the day of equinox in September. At other times, it will \nmove above or below the center, as illustrated (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_5\n\n\n135\n\nO\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\na\nl \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n\n Amazonas 2  follows before and after the September equinox. The situation is \nnearly the same in other years since the cycle of the Sun\u2019s declination repeats every \nyear. A similar set of eclipses take place during the March equinox. On a few dates, \nthe satellites in Table  4.6  pass through just the penumbra. Eclipse times depend on \nthe longitude of the satellite and the observer\u2019s time zone. Tables  4.7 ,  4.8 ,  4.9 ,  4.10 , \n 4.11 ,  4.12 ,  4.13  and  4.14  list predicted times of geostationary satellite eclipses for \nthe United Kingdom and different regions of the United States. These are based on \na solid, airless Earth. The method used in computing predicted eclipse times is \ndescribed in Chap.   6    .          \n\n Figure  4.25  shows the amount of time a geostationary satellite spends in Earth\u2019s \numbra and penumbra. Calculations are based on the solid Earth and do not \ninclude atmospheric effects. The assumed latitude of all satellites is 0.00\u00b0. Eclipses \nmay last up to 72 min near equinox. One may estimate the length of an eclipse by \nknowing the date and time of equinox. For example, a satellite will remain in the \numbra for 60 min on October 5 (12 days after equinox). It will spend 2.5 min in the \npenumbra in going from P1 to U1 and another 2.5 min in going from U4 to P4. \nTherefore, it will spend a total of 5 min in the penumbra.  \n\n   Table 4.7.

This observation is based on the loca-\ntion of maximum contrast between the penumbra and umbra. Essentially, the location \nof highest contrast differs from that of the umbra boundary for a solid, airless Earth. \nThis is illustrated in Fig.  4.26 . Portions of the penumbra and umbra are shown \nhere. On the left, part of the penumbra is on top and part of the umbra is on the bottom \nfor a solid, airless Earth. In this case, no refracted light enters the umbra. Therefore, it \nis black. No sunlight reaches it. On the right, parts of the penumbra and umbra are \nshown for Earth with its atmosphere. These drawings have two differences. The  fi rst \none showing the area of maximum contrast is much higher in the drawing on the right \nthan the one on the left. This is the umbra enlargement and is discussed further in \nChap.   5    . A second difference between the two drawings is that the umbra is not black \nin the right one but is black in the left one. This is because our atmosphere refracts \nsome sunlight into the umbra as is shown in the drawing on the right.  \n\n The maximum contrast usually corresponds to a maximum brightness drop per \nunit of time. Visual observations are consistent with a small umbra enlargement. \nIt will be interesting to make accurate brightness measurements of a satellite as it \nmoves through Earth\u2019s shadow. Eclipses are discussed further in Chaps.   5     and   6    . \n\n Table  4.15  lists a few important websites that are mentioned in this chapter along \nwith the information they provide.             \n\nhttp://www.arachnoid.com/satfinderonline/index.php\nhttp://www.calsky.com/es.cgi\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_5\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-3915-8_6\n\n\n137\n\nO\nb\nse\n\nrv\nin\n\ng\n \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\na\nl \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns\n\n   Table 4.9.

This is because of the development of sensitive \nvideo cameras. Observers have obtained angular resolutions of one-half of an arc \nsecond. This corresponds to about a meter for a satellite 400 km away. Others have \nrecorded satellites transiting our Sun and Moon. \n\n An arti fi cial satellite orbiting Earth is different from a planet or deep sky object \nin two ways. It moves much faster across the sky than planets, and its brightness \nmay change in a few seconds. The rapid brightness change may be caused by a \nchanging distance, a changing phase or a varying amount of specular re fl ection. \nThese differences pose a special challenge to the operator of a small telescope. This \nis because it is dif fi cult to obtain hundreds of images to stack. Instead one should \nbe content to capture a few frames of a satellite. In time, it may be possible for \nmounts to track a satellite. But even if this occurs, one may have to deal with the \nchanging brightness. \n\n In this section, we will explore the work of four individuals who have used dif-\nferent techniques to image satellites. One of these, Ralf Vandebergh, has imaged \nover a dozen satellites. Others have imaged the International Space Station transit-\ning the Moon, Sun and passing close to Venus. \n\n   Tom Faber \n\n Tom uses a Canon Powershot SX100lS camera on a tripod. He usually sets the \nexposure for 15 s. The camera is focused at in fi nity and the ISO is selected. Tom \nalso uses a timer that helps reduce unwanted vibrations during an exposure. \n\n Tom made the image in Fig.  5.1 . It shows the International Space Station and the \nspace shuttle  Endeavour   fl ying side by side. The ISS is the brighter streak at the top. \nIt was brightest at the right edge.   \n\nR.

He uses a telescope along \nwith a DMK21AU04.AS monochrome Astrovideo camera. The shutter speed is set \nat 0.001 s, and video is taken at 60 frames per second. \n\n In late 2010, Theo recorded a unique image showing the International Space \nStation passing Venus. See Fig.  5.2 . Below we describe how he constructed this \nimage.  \n\n  Fig. 5.1.    This is an image of the International Space Station and the space shuttle  Endeavour.  The ISS is at the top. The exposure was 15 s, \nand, hence, the fast moving satellites appear as a line (Credit: Tom Faber).       \n\n  Fig. 5.2.    Theo Ramakers and Frank Garner took this image on September 25, 2010, at 20:38:04 Universal Time. It shows Venus and the \nInternational Space Station. Essentially, video was taken at a rate of 60 frames per second. Each frame was stacked, showing the resulting image \n(Credit: Theo Ramakers and Frank Garner).       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n145\n\nIm\nag\n\nin\ng \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\nal\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns \nan\n\nd\n \n\nD\noi\n\nng\n R\n\nes\nea\n\nrc\nh\n\n Theo used the CalSky website (listed in Table   4.15    ) to determine when the \nInternational Space Station (ISS) would pass close to Venus. As it turned out, the \ntransit took place in the daytime at 4:38 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time on September \n25, 2010. On that day, Theo and Frank Garner set up an 80 mm stellarvue refractor \nalong with a computer, camera and other equipment. They used several steps to \nmake the image in Fig.  5.2 . They  fi rst recorded several seconds of video of Venus \nabout 1 min before the transit. This video was later used to construct a properly \nexposed image of Venus. After taking the Venus video, these two adjusted the cam-\nera settings to get the correct exposure time for the ISS. Keep in mind the phase of \nthe ISS was like that of Venus and, hence, was dimmer than what it would be at half \nphase. Shortly afterwards, they recorded the transit of the ISS and Venus. The ISS \nwas correctly exposed but Venus was overexposed in these frames. Theo and Frank \nused  Photoshop\u2122  to construct the  fi nal image. They constructed a properly \nexposed image of Venus from the video taken just before the transit. Afterwards \nthey replaced the overexposed Venus area with the correctly exposed image of \nVenus. This was done for each frame containing the ISS. Therefore, each frame now \nhad both the ISS and Venus correctly exposed. Finally the images were stacked, \ncreating what we see in this  fi gure. Since 60 frames were taken in 1 s, each one \nshows the ISS in a different location.  \n\n   Ralf Vandebergh \n\n Ralf has imaged arti fi cial satellites for several years. His technique is summarized \nin Table  5.1 . Ralf uses a well-aligned  fi nderscope with a magni fi cation of 6\u00d7 to \ntrack his target manually. Ralf and his telescope are shown in Fig.  5.3 . In many \ncases he is able to get several images within a second. Since a satellite\u2019s appearance \nusually does not change in a second, he may stack images. After some processing \nhe produces a  fi nal image. Figure  5.4  shows an image of the ISS. Parts about 1 m \nacross are visible. Several solar panels are visible along with a few modules. Ralf \nwas able to attain an angular resolution of about one half of an arc second in this \nimage. He also imaged  Meteor 1,  an old Soviet weather satellite. See Fig.  5.5 . It was \nlaunched in 1969. The image is blurry because the target is small. It is about the size \nof a sport utility vehicle. In spite of the large distance (425 km or 264 miles), Ralf \nwas able to image its general shape. Figure  5.6  shows the shape of the recently \nlaunched  Nanosail D  satellite. This is an experimental solar sail the size of an auto-\nmobile. Ralf was 667 km (415 miles) from the target when he took the image. Ralf \n\n   Table 5.1.

The ISS Transit Prediction program can be \nfound at Ed\u2019s website:   http://pictures.ed-morana.com/ISSTransits/predictions/\nindex.html    . \n\n Recording a transit can be dif fi cult. One dif fi culty is the satellite and Moon \n(or Sun) travel at different angular speeds. An arti fi cial satellite may travel \n\n  Fig. 5.5.

Because of this \ndifference one should get a single frame of the satellite. A more serious problem \nis the brightness difference between the Sun (magnitude of ?27) and a satellite \n(magnitude ~0). For this reason, a procedure like the one used to make Fig.  5.2  \nshould be used. \n\n Figure  5.8  shows the ISS transiting the Moon.

What can one learn from satellite observations? \nPlenty. For example, one may determine how the environment in deep space affects \nthe brightness and color of satellites. One may also monitor Earth\u2019s shadow \n(umbra) and our atmosphere. One would do this by measuring the brightness of a \ngeostationary satellite as it moves through Earth\u2019s umbra. \n\n This section will summarize research projects. We will start out with a review \nof our knowledge of Earth\u2019s umbra from lunar eclipses. Afterwards, we will exam-\nine eclipse measurements and a few experimental results. The chapter will end \nwith a discussion of brightness measurements of satellites and what we may learn \nfrom them.  \n\n   Table 5.2.

Two sources of \nsunlight in this area are refracted and scattered light. In refraction, our atmosphere \nbends sunlight by a small amount. Scattering is different. Sunlight hits the atmos-\nphere and bounces around, and some of it ends up in the umbra. Atmospheric dust \nforward-scatters a small amount of light. To make matters more complicated, the \natmosphere refracts and scatters some colors of light more than others. For exam-\nple, it refracts more red than blue light. This is why the fully eclipsed Moon often \nhas a reddish hue. The amount of refracted and scattered light depends on several \nthings. A discussion of this is beyond the scope of the book. \n\n Without the atmosphere, an object in the umbra would only be illuminated by \nstarlight and light re fl ected by Solar System objects. Its brightness would drop \nabout 20 stellar magnitudes.  (This number may be computed in the following way. \nFirst compute a combined brightness of magnitude ?6.0 for all stars brighter than \nmagnitude 11.50 using information in the Millennium Star Atlas \u00a91997 by Sinnott \nand Perrymann, p VII and XI. If the brightness of fainter stars and other objects are \nincluded, the combined brightness may reach ?7.5. However, half of this light will \nnot reach the side of the object facing us. This reduces the total brightness by 0.75 \nmagnitudes to ?6.75. This is 20.0 magnitudes fainter than our Sun.)  Without any \nsunlight reaching the umbra, the Moon would drop from a brightness of magni-\ntude ?13 to magnitude +7. Since the late 1950s, the fully eclipsed Moon has always \nbeen at least a factor of 10 brighter than magnitude 7. Therefore, since that time, \nour atmosphere has always refracted and/or scattered some light into the umbra. \n\n Both the brightness and color of an object changes at it enters the umbra. \nTherefore, brightness measurements of an object moving through the umbra may \nyield information on our atmosphere. \n\n   Lunar Eclipses: What We Have Learned About \nOur Umbra \n\n The amount of refracted and scattered light entering Earth\u2019s umbra changes from \nday to day. This is caused by varying amounts of dust and aerosols in the strato-\nsphere and mesosphere along with changing pressure, temperature and chemical \ncomposition in the different layers of our atmosphere. Therefore, the Moon\u2019s \nbrightness and color will be different from one eclipse to the next. Furthermore, at \nany given time, some parts of the umbra receive more light than others. Therefore, \nthe brightness of the Moon also changes at different depths in the umbra. \n\n We have a record of lunar eclipses dating back several decades. Because of the \nextensive record of brightness and color measurements during eclipses, we have a \nbetter understanding of Earth\u2019s umbra. Many questions, however, remain to be \nanswered. In the next two sections, you will learn about relevant lunar eclipse \nmeasurements. Afterwards, you will learn about factors that affect lunar eclipse \nobservations. \n\n One may measure the Danjon number during a total lunar eclipse. Astronomers \nestimate this on a scale from 0 to 4. A Danjon number of 0 is assigned when the \neclipsed Moon is almost invisible and has a dark gray color. On the other hand, a \nDanjon number of 4 is assigned when it is very bright with a bright copper-red or \n\n\n\n151\n\nIm\nag\n\nin\ng \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\nal\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns \nan\n\nd\n \n\nD\noi\n\nng\n R\n\nes\nea\n\nrc\nh\n\norange color. Figure  5.10  shows the Danjon number for several total lunar eclipses. \nLarge drops in the Danjon number occurred after major volcanic eruptions in \n1963, 1982 and 1991. The data also show the Danjon number returns to a normal \nvalue of about 2.0 one to two years after a major eruption. The average Danjon \nnumber for all data in the graph is 2.0 with a standard deviation of 0.8.  \n\n One may also measure the Moon\u2019s brightness drop during a total lunar eclipse. \nThis is computed from\n\n     ( )    = - - + \u00b4 \u00b4 DBrightness drop magnitudes Mb [0.19 0.35 5.0 log(r )]    (5.1)   \n In this equation, Mb is the brightness of the eclipsed Moon in stellar magni-\n\ntudes, r and  ?  are the Moon \u2013 Sun and Moon \u2013 Earth distances, respectively. Both \nr and  ?  are in astronomical units (au). The 0.19 term is from Schmude  (  2000  )  and \nrepresents the Moon\u2019s brightness in stellar magnitudes if it is 1.0 au from Earth \nand the Sun at full phase. The 0.35 term is the Moon\u2019s opposition surge, which is \nhow much it brightens (in stellar magnitudes) when its phase angle approaches \nzero degrees. \n\n Two ways of measuring Mb are the reverse binocular method and the whole-disc \nphotometry method. In the reverse binocular method, one looks at an object of \nknown brightness in stellar magnitudes with the unaided eye and then looks at the \neclipsed Moon through binoculars in reverse. One then estimates its brightness in \nterms of the object and uses an equation to compute the  fi nal brightness value. One \nmay estimate the brightness of the Moon to an accuracy of ~0.5 magnitudes. This \nmethod is described in  Comets and How to Observe Them  \u00a92010 by Richard \nSchmude, Jr., pp. 130\u2013131. A second way of measuring Mb is the whole-disc pho-\ntometry method. Since 2000, the writer and co-workers have measured the bright-\nness of the eclipsed Moon using an SSP-3 photometer along with  fi lters transformed \nto the B, V, R and I system. One may measure Mb values to an accuracy of ~0.07 \nmagnitudes with this method. \n\n Figure  5.11  shows brightness drop values of the eclipsed Moon. The major vol-\ncanic eruptions in 1963, 1982 and 1991 caused a larger-than-average brightness \ndrop. Therefore, the umbra was darker than normal. As in the case of the Danjon \nnumber, the umbra returned to normal 1\u20132 years after each eruption. The average \n\n  Fig. 5.10.

The contrast is highest at this boundary. Earth is different. It \nhas an atmosphere that affects sunlight. Because of the atmosphere, the boundary \nbetween the penumbra and umbra is fuzzy. Astronomers have de fi ned this bound-\nary as the point of maximum contrast. See Fig.   4.26    . In the next few paragraphs, the \numbra is de fi ned in this manner. \n\n Lunar eclipses have enabled astronomers to measure the size of the umbra. During \nthe last several decades, astronomers recorded the times when speci fi c craters passed \ninto the umbra. These have enabled others to compute its size. As it turns out, it is \nlarger than expected. The expected size is based on a solid, airless Earth. The differ-\nence between the expected and observed size is expressed as the percent enlarge-\nment. A typical value is 2%. Our atmosphere is believed to be the cause of the \nenlarged umbra. Like the Danjon number and the brightness drop, the percent \nenlargement changes. Figure  5.12  shows measurements made over the past few \ndecades. The average enlargement is 2.09% with a standard deviation of 0.31%.  \n\n  Fig. 5.11.    The graph shows the brightness drop of the Moon near mid-totality versus the year.

In many cases these are larger than \nthe uncertainties. Let\u2019s look at some factors that lead to the changes in Figs.  5.10 , \n 5.11 , and  5.12 . \n\n The amount of stratospheric ozone affects lunar eclipse measurements. \nKarkoschka and Aguirre  (  1996  )  developed a model that predicts the brightness \nand color of the eclipsed Moon. For example, in this model, a reduction in strat-\nospheric ozone causes more light to enter the umbra. This is consistent with the \nreported drop in ozone levels along with my analysis of lunar eclipse data. \nEssentially, Eq.  5.2  is computed from the linear least squares method.\n\n     ( )= -Brightness drop of the Moon stellar magnitudes 12.38 0.031t    (5.2)   \n\n In this equation, t is the number of years after January 1.0, 1960. Equation  5.2  \ndoes not include data from 1956, 1982, 1992 or 1993 due to interference from large \nvolcanic eruptions. This equation shows that the brightness drop of the eclipsed \nMoon increased by 0.031 magnitude per year between 1960 and 2011. This is con-\nsistent with the umbra becoming brighter and, hence, a drop in stratospheric \nozone. The correlation coef fi cient for Eq.  5.2 , however, was ?0.40. Recall that the \ncorrelation coef fi cient is always between ?1.0 and 1.0. Values near zero mean that \nthere is no linear relationship between two variables. A value near 1.0 means that \nthere is a strong linear relationship between the two variables and a value near \n?1.0 means a strong negative linear relationship between two variables. \n\n Volcanic eruptions also affect lunar eclipse measurements. At least one volcanic \neruption occurs each year. It is the large ones on land that affect our atmosphere \nand climate. Scientists have a number of ways of estimating the strength of these \nevents. One of these is the Volcanic Explosive Index, or VEI. This is based on the \nvolume of material released along with the plume height. The higher the VEI value, \nthe more powerful the eruption. Table  5.3  lists the most powerful events between \n1955 and the late 1990s. This is based on the VEI value. These are designated with \nan asterisk in Figs.  5.10 ,  5.11 , and  5.12 . The umbra darkens after major eruptions. \nNo total lunar eclipses took place in 1980 or 1981. Consequently, the impact of the \nMount St. Helens event was not measured. By the time of the next lunar eclipse in \nearly 1982, the atmosphere had returned to normal.  \n\n Another reason for the changes in lunar eclipses is the umbra itself. The umbra \nis darkest near the center. For example, Rougier and Dubois (cited in Barbier  1961  )  \ncarried out brightness measurements of the Moon during the total lunar eclipse of \n\n   Table 5.3.    This table lists some of the most violent volcanic eruptions between 1956 and the late 1990s. All of these eruptions \nexcept for possibly Agung, had a Volcanic Explosive Index of 5 or higher according to Simkin and Siebert  (  2000  ) . Bullard  (  1976  )  reports \nAgung released more material into the atmosphere than the Bezymianny eruption and, hence, Agung is included in the table. Some data \nwere also taken from Whitford-Stark  (  2001  ) . The date of the Agung eruption is from Wikipedia   \n\n Volcano  Eruption  Country \n\n Cerro Hudson  1991  Chile \n Pinatubo  1991  Philippines \n El Chich\u00f3n  1982  Mexico \n Saint Helens  1980  United States \n Agung  1963  Indonesia \n Bezymianny  1956  Russia \n\n\n\n154\n\nIm\nag\n\nin\ng \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\nal\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns \nan\n\nd\n \n\nD\noi\n\nng\n R\n\nes\nea\n\nrc\nh\n\nMarch 2\u20133, 1942. Their results show the Moon dimmed by several stellar magnitudes \njust inside the umbra and dimmed by an additional amount near the umbra center. \nMore recently, Westfall and this author used a photometer to measure the bright-\nness of a small area of the Moon as it moved through the umbra. These studies \nshow the umbra is darkest near the center. Approximate brightness drop values are \nshown in Fig.  5.13 . Therefore, if the Moon moves through the umbra center, it \nwould get darker than if it remains near the upper edge.  \n\n To sum up, our atmosphere affects the Moon\u2019s color and brightness during a \ntotal eclipse. The location of the Moon within the umbra also affects its color and \nbrightness. Our atmosphere also affects the size and shape of the umbra. Therefore, \nby studying the umbra and eclipses we may learn more about our atmosphere. \nAccurate measurements of the brightness and color of objects in our umbra should \nyield tighter constraints on models of our atmosphere.  \n\n   Measurement of Umbra Characteristics \n\n Geostationary satellites serve as excellent probes of the umbra because they are \njust a few meters across. They subtend an angle of ~0.02 arc seconds. Therefore, \nastronomers may monitor the umbra at the ~0.1 km scale by measuring their \nbrightness. The Moon, on the other hand, is an extended object. Thus, Moon meas-\nurements may yield umbra characteristics at the 20\u20131,000 km scale. \n\n Two sources of sunlight fall into Earth\u2019s shadow. These are direct sunlight and \nlight that our atmosphere either refracts or scatters. Direct, refracted and scattered \nall fall into the penumbra, whereas only refracted and scattered light fall into the \n\n  Fig. 5.13.    Approximate brightness drop values (in stellar magnitudes) for different locations in the umbra. These are based on the results \nof Westfall  (  1982,   1988  )  and Schmude et al.  (  2000  ) . All values are with respect to the uneclipsed Moon (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n\n\n155\n\nIm\nag\n\nin\ng \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\nal\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns \nan\n\nd\n \n\nD\noi\n\nng\n R\n\nes\nea\n\nrc\nh\n\numbra. See Fig.  5.14 . These drawings show how Earth, its atmosphere and our Sun \nwould look in the penumbra and umbra. The solid white area in Fig.  5.14a  is our \nSun. About half of it is blocked. Stage A occurs in the penumbra. Stages B and C \noccur in our umbra. Figure  5.14b  is the stage just after Earth blocks all direct sun-\nlight. The amount of refracted and scattered light is greatest at the right edge. The \ndotted area around Earth represents refracted and scattered light. Based on meas-\nurements of our Moon and one geostationary satellite, the scattered and re fl ected \nlight in Fig.  5.14b  is about 2% of the light in Fig.  5.14a . This is also why a sharp drop \nin brightness does not occur as a lunar feature or satellite reaches U1. See Figs.   4.23     \nand   4.26    .  \n\n How will the brightness of a geostationary satellite change as it enters Earth\u2019s \nshadow? To answer this question, several things should be considered. Recall from \nChap.   4     that a satellite\u2019s brightness depends on its distance, phase and mode of \nre fl ection. The brightness of a geostationary satellite may rise to magnitude 7.5 \njust before entering Earth\u2019s shadow. Part of this is because it has nearly a full phase. \nA second factor to consider is the source of light entering Earth\u2019s shadow. If we \nassume a satellite reaches a stellar magnitude of 7.5 just before eclipse, it should \ndrop to magnitude 11.5 at the darkest portion of the penumbra. Once inside the \numbra, it should drop further depending on how deep it moves. Although the satel-\nlite will grow faint, it is still possible for an operator of a 0.3-m telescope with an \nappropriate camera to measure its brightness. These measurements will yield \nmagnitude drops at different umbra depths. A third factor that may affect satellite \nbrightness is the mode of re fl ection. If the amount of specular re fl ection increases \nduring an eclipse this would affect satellite brightness. Finally, the amount of strat-\nospheric ozone should affect brightness. \n\n One should be aware of two sources of error in brightness measurements. One \nof these is changes in atmospheric transparency during an eclipse. This will cause \na satellite to get brighter or dimmer and lead to error. Therefore, one should \nmonitor the brightness of background stars during an eclipse. (Recall that Earth\u2019s \nshadow does not affect background stars.) If stars dim suddenly, this would indi-\ncate a change in atmospheric transparency. Therefore, the brightness of back-\nground stars may serve as a calibration source for atmospheric transparency. \nA second source of error is condensation on telescope parts. A dew shield will help \nprevent condensation on the objective lens or corrector plate. \n\n  Fig. 5.14.    Three views of Earth eclipsing the Sun.

We will \n fi rst examine some experimental results. Afterwards, we will explore research \nprojects, grazing eclipses and brightness measurements of distant satellites.  \n\n   Experimental Results \n\n Using a 0.12 m refracting telescope this author was able to time eclipses of the \ngeostationary satellite  Amazonas 2  by Earth. All measurements were made between \nOctober 1 and 16, 2011. Since  Amazonas 2  was bright, it was selected for study. \nIt was also easy to identify since it had a fainter companion \u2013  Amazonas 1.  See \nFig.  5.15 . Figure  5.16  shows a typical light curve of this satellite as it passed into \nEarth\u2019s shadow. The dimming started off very slow. As  Amazonas 2  moved deeper \ninto the penumbra, it grew dimmer. During this time, refracted and scattered light \nwas about 2% of the light reaching this satellite. When it approached U1, its bright-\nness  fl uctuated by over a stellar magnitude. This  fl uctuation continued for about \n15 s. These  fl uctuations are caused by changes in our atmosphere. They contain \ndata. After the  fl uctuations the satellite faded below the limiting magnitude.   \n\n Figure  5.17  shows the general shape of Earth\u2019s shadow. The points represent the \ntime interval between when  Amazonas 2  disappeared and when its right ascension \nwas exactly opposite that of our Sun. A portion of the elliptical shadow is visible. \nTable  5.4  summarizes the writer\u2019s eclipse data. In some cases,  Amazonas 2  disap-\npeared before it reached U1, and in other cases it disappeared a few seconds after \nreaching U1.     \n\n  Fig. 5.15.

This may be done with the appropriate camera, software and telescope. \nRemember, a clock drive is not needed. Since satellites may grow quite dim, a large \n\n  Fig. 5.16.

This graph shows the number of minutes before T when  Amazonas 2  became invisible at different Sun declinations in October 2011. In \nthis graph, T is the time when the satellite has exactly the opposite right ascension from our Sun and would be at mid-eclipse (Credit: Richard Schmude, Jr.).       \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n158\n\nIm\nag\n\nin\ng \n\nA\nrt\n\nifi\nci\n\nal\n \n\nSa\nte\n\nlli\nte\n\ns \nan\n\nd\n \n\nD\noi\n\nng\n R\n\nes\nea\n\nrc\nh\n\ntelescope aperture will give better results. The amount of dimming will depend on \nthe characteristics of our atmosphere. With a suf fi cient amount of eclipse data, \nscientists may be able to construct better models of our atmosphere. For example, \nyou can use eclipse measurements to determine how a large volcanic eruption or \nsolar outburst affects our atmosphere. Unlike lunar eclipses, satellite eclipses occur \nalmost 90 nights a year. Therefore, one can monitor day-to-day changes in the \numbra. One can even monitor atmospheric characteristics over different areas of \nthe world by observing eclipses at different times. Several hundred geostationary \nsatellites orbit Earth. They cover all longitudes. \n\n A second research project is to measure the satellite brightness with two or \nmore color  fi lters. This will yield color data. We know the Moon gets redder as it \nenters the umbra. Geostationary satellites should also grow redder as they move \ninto the umbra. Color data will enable scientists to construct better models of our \natmosphere. \n\n One may also measure the central  fl ash. This occurs when an object passes near \nthe umbra\u2019s center. Astronomers have recorded central  fl ashes of stars many times. \nIn these cases, a planet with an atmosphere moves in front the star. According to \nElliot  (  1979  )  when light is refracted around a planet\u2019s limb and arrives at the same \nlocation near the umbra\u2019s center, a central  fl ash occurs. Geostationary satellites \npass near the umbra\u2019s center within 1 day of equinox. Therefore, this is one more \nmeasurement that can be made. The magnitude and color of the central  fl ash may \ngive us information about the extinction of our atmosphere. \n\n   Grazing Eclipses \n\n A grazing eclipse of a geostationary satellite is one that occurs when the Sun\u2019s dec-\nlination is between 8.40\u00b0 and 8.60\u00b0. When it equals 8.40\u00b0, the satellite just touches \nthe boundary of the un-enlarged umbra. When the declination equals 8.60\u00b0, it \ntouches the umbra boundary only when it is enlarged by 2.0%. Table  5.5  shows the \ndates and times when the Sun has a declination between 8.40\u00b0 and 8.60\u00b0 between \n2013 and 2020. Grazing eclipses occur on four dates each year. Each opportunity \nlasts for about 13 h. For example, during the year 2016, grazing eclipses will occur \non February 27, April 11, August 31 and October 14\u201315. A satellite may  fl icker for \nseveral seconds to perhaps a minute during a grazing eclipse. Occultations and \n fl ickering are described in  Uranus, Neptune and Pluto and How to Observe Them  \n\n   Table 5.4.

My limiting magnitude was ~12. The Sun\u2019s declination was \n8.36\u00b0S. The satellite grew dimmer and  fl ickered before disappearing. It was invis-\nible for almost 13 min (3:43:46\u20133:56:40 U.T.). Therefore, even at the boundary of \nthe umbra and penumbra, objects may dim by at least four stellar magnitudes. On \nthe next night, the Sun\u2019s declination was 8.73\u00b0S.  Amazonas 2  dimmed about 1.5 \nstellar magnitudes, but it always remained visible.  Amazonas 1  was nearby.

At times, it was near the limit of visibility. \n Amazonas 2  remained visible the whole time because it did not enter the umbra.  \n\n   Brightness Measurements of Distant Satellites \n\n One research project that a few individuals have undertaken is to monitor the bright-\nness of satellites and hazardous space debris. Unlike natural bodies, human-made \nobjects often have a measurable brightness drop over a few years. Brightness changes \nare important from the standpoint of monitoring hazardous space debris. \n\n Astronomers measure the brightness and other characteristics of distant satel-\nlites and report their results to the Minor Planet Center. This organization then \npublishes the results in the Distant Arti fi cial Satellites Observation (DASO) circu-\nlars. These circulars are available online at   http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/\nDASO/DASO_OLD.html    . \n\n As mentioned in Chap.   4    , the standard magnitude is the brightness a satellite has \nwhen it is 1.0 astronomical unit from our Sun, is 1,000 km from the observer and is \nat half phase. The standard V  fi lter magnitude will be written as V(1, 1,000, 90\u00b0). \n\n   Table 5.5.

These equations are the  fi rst step in determining \nhow the space environment affects satellite brightness over time.   \n\n Miles  (  2011  )  reports that the paint on RK252A5 (probably a spent rocket booster \nlaunched in the 1950s or 1960s.) grew darker by about a factor of three. This is equal \nto a brightness drop of 1.2 stellar magnitudes. This was motivation to look at other \nsatellites. Figure  5.19  shows how the brightness of the  Planck  and the  Wilkinson \nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)  satellites has changed over time. In both \ngraphs, the normalized magnitude V(1, 1000, 90\u00b0) is plotted against the date.  \n\n Between October 9, 2009, and October 28, 2011,  Planck  darkened at a rate of 0.39 \nstellar magnitudes per year.  Planck  lifted off on May 14, 2009. Therefore, it dimmed \nsubstantially during its  fi rst 2.5 years in space. \n\n The  WMAP  satellite grew darker at an average rate of 0.04 magnitudes/year. \nUnlike  Planck,  the results for  WMAP  started almost 4 years after this satellite \nwas launched. Therefore, much of the darkening may have occurred before 2005. \nThe results of  Planck, WMAP  and  RK252A5  (Miles  2011  )  suggest satellites darken \n\n   Table 5.6.

The normalized magnitudes of both satellites are computed using Eq.  5.3  and an assumed value of c V  = 0.014 magnitude/\ndegree.

The deepest eclipses occur at equinox. The satellite \npath through Earth\u2019s shadow depends on the Sun\u2019s declination. It also depends on \nthe exact satellite position. The observer\u2019s longitude and latitude, however, will not \naffect the eclipse time. In this chapter, we will explore how to compute eclipse \ntimes for a geostationary satellite. \n\n Eclipse times are predicted to the nearest minute. More exact times require \nexact satellite positions. As mentioned in Chap.   4     and illustrated in Fig. 4.1, satellite \npositions may change a little. The website   http://www.n2yo.com/satellites/?c=10     \nlists positions to the nearest 0.01\u00b0. One should plan to start watching for an eclipse \na few minutes before the published eclipse times because of changing satellite \npositions. \n\n We will  fi rst examine time zones, and afterwards, eclipses. Each time zone has a \nstandard longitude. Standard longitudes are listed in Table  6.1 . For the Eastern \nTime Zone, the standard longitude is 75\u00b0W. The W (west) is added because this \nzone is west of the Prime Meridian, which runs through Greenwich, England. The \ntime depends on the location of the standard longitude. For example, all clocks in \nthe Eastern Time Zone are 5 h behind those in Greenwich, England. Time no \nlonger depends on the position of the Sun. Most of the United States, Canada and \nthe United Kingdom recognize Daylight Savings Time. As of 2011, it begins on the \nsecond Sunday in March and ends on the  fi rst Sunday in November for the United \nStates and Canada. In the United Kingdom, British Summer Time begins on the \nlast Sunday in March and ends on the last Sunday in October. This time change \nshould be included in predicted eclipse times.  \n\n The  fi rst step in computing eclipse times is to determine when the satellite\u2019s \nright ascension is exactly opposite that of our Sun (T). See Fig.  6.1 . Segment LK in \nthis drawing has a right ascension opposite to that of our Sun, and it bisects the \nsegment between P1 and P4 and the segment between U1 and U4. Segment LK also \ncrosses the center of Earth\u2019s shadow. We know the center of Earth\u2019s shadow transits \nthe meridian twelve hours after the Sun. The appropriate equation for T is: \n\n     \n( ) ( )= - + - \u00b4 -T E 12hours 1 hour 4.0 minute / degree SL st .\n\n   \n(6.1)\n\n  \n\n  In this equation, E is the ephemeris transit time of the Sun, SL is the satellite lon-\ngitude and st is the standard longitude.

One may compute T for other time zones; \nhowever, the correct standard longitude should be used. \n\n Note especially that these values are in relation to the exact moment of equinox. \nFor example, the equinox was at 9:05 UT on September 23, 2011. Therefore, 10 days \nbefore this equinox corresponds to 9:05 UT on September 13, 2011. The exact time \nof equinox shifts by a few hours each year. \n\n The next task is to determine the time of P1, U1, U4 and P4. The ephemeris \ntransit time of the Sun and the Earth-Sun distance changes throughout the year \nbecause of Earth\u2019s elliptical orbit. See Table  6.2 . Figure  6.2  illustrates Earth\u2019s \nshadow and the paths a geostationary satellite will follow before and after equinox. \nThe distance between P1 (or P4) and segment LK equals Pm and that between U1 \n(or U4) and segment LK equals Um. In order to determine when a satellite is at P1, \nyou would subtract the time it takes for it to travel the distance Pm from T. \nLikewise, in order to compute the time of U1, you would subtract the time it takes \nfor the satellite to travel the distance Um from T. Therefore, we will examine the \nsteps needed to compute Pm and Um.  \n\n   Table 6.2.    Declination and Ephemeris transit times of the Sun near equinox in March and September.

The equation of the line \nrunning through P1 and P4 is:\n\n     = \u00b4 dY d sin( )    (6.8)  \n  In this equation, d is the radius of the satellite\u2019s orbit and  d  is the Sun\u2019s declination. \nTo compute the X coordinate of P1, one must substitute Eq.  6.8  into  6.2 :\n\n     ( )( )\u00b4 d\n+ =\n\n2\n2\n\n2 2\nE P\n\nd sinX\n1\n\nP P\n\n   \n\n(6.9)\n\n  \n\nor rearrange it as:\n\n     ( ){ }{ }\u00e9 \u00f9= \u00b4 - \u00b4 d\u00eb \u00fb\n0.5\n\n22 2\nE PX P 1 d sin( ) / P\n\n   \n(6.10)\n\n  \n\n  The value of X is the X coordinate of P1 and it equals Pm. The distance between P4 \nor P1 and segment LK is Pm. In a similar way, one may  fi nd the X component of U1 \nand determine Um by substituting Eq.  6.8  into  6.3 . This equals Um. Therefore, you \ncan write:\n\n     \n( ){ }{ }\u00e9 \u00f9= \u00b4 - \u00b4 d\u00eb \u00fb\n\n0.5\n22 2\n\nE PPm P 1 d sin( ) / P\n   \n\n(6.11)\n  \n\n     \n( ){ }{ }\u00e9 \u00f9= \u00b4 - \u00b4 d\u00eb \u00fb\n\n0.5\n22 2\n\nE PUm U 1 d sin( ) / U\n   \n\n(6.12)\n  \n\n  Once the values of Pm and Um are determined you can compute the times of P1, \nU1, U4 and P4 as:\n\n     ( )= - \u00b8Time of P1 T Pm 3.066 km / s    (6.13)  \n     ( )= + \u00b8Time of P4 T Pm 3.066 km / s    (6.14)  \n     ( )= - \u00b8Time of U1 T Um 3.066 km / s    (6.15)  \n     ( )= + \u00b8Time of U4 T Um 3.066 km / s    (6.16)  \n  In all four equations, the 3.066 km/s is the average speed of a geostationary satellite \nwith respect to Earth\u2019s shadow. \n\n Values of Pm and Um for several times near the March and September equi-\nnoxes are listed in Table  6.3 .  \n\n The method for computing the time of P1, P4, U1 and U4 are summarized in \nFig.  6.3 .  \n\nC\no\nm\n\np\nu\nta\n\nti\no\nn\n \n\no\nf \n\nEc\nlip\n\nse\n T\n\nim\nes\n\n\n\n168\n\n  Fig. 6.3.
