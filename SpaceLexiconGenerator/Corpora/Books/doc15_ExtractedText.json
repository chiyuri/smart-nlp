It is a comprehensive and modern treatment of the theory of or-\nbital mechanics, its application, and current day samples of how it is used in\nthe field. In that sense, it is not just a textbook for classroom-style lectures;\nit is truly a handbook for practitioners.\n\nIt is full of fascinating historical information and references that intrigue\nthe readers to follow the anecdotes and details on how this particular disci-\npline evolved from the collective genius of giants in mathematics, physics and\nastronomy such as Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Newton, Galileo, Lagrange, Laplace,\nGauss, Poincare? and Einstein. This story telling not only makes reading in-\nteresting but also challenges the readers to understand the fundamentals used\nby these giants before the advent of computers.\n\nMost classroom-style textbook would skip intermediate steps in the deriva-\ntion of equations or refer the readers to the original papers or textbooks. This\nbook provides sufficient intermediate steps so readers with basic freshman\nmathematics can follow the logical steps. Its treatment of geodesy, geopoten-\ntial and perturbation methods connects theory to physical measurements and\nobservables. The chapter on Orbit and Mission is unique in that it provides a\ncomprehensive survey of how theory is applied to real-life missions. It connects\nthis discipline to science and inspires the reader to appreciate how a satellite\norbit provides a special vantage point for conducting scientific measurements.\nOrbital mechanics is not just about getting into space, but it is integral to\nthe measurement technique such as altimetry, radar topography, radio occul-\ntation, interferometry and gravity field through radiometric observables. The\ncomprehensive treatment on designing an orbit for systematic ground track\ncontrol and target point visibility is unique. In the past, practitioners had to\nconduct a literature search and examine multiple publications. Its treatment\non GPS begs the reader to further explore the world of precision orbit deter-\nmination, timing and terrestrial reference frame. The book is sprinkled with\nstories of much innovative use of \u201ctricks\u201d in orbital mechanics such as frozen\norbit, sun-synchronicity, aerobraking, libration point and Lissajous orbits, and\ngravity assist that enables missions like Voyager Grand Tour, Galileo, Cassini-\n\nV\n\n\n\nVI Foreword\n\nHuygens and tours of their satellites. This book has superb illustrations and\ngraphics enhanced by colorful photographs.\n\nSince the flight of Explorer 1, JPL prides itself in pioneering techniques\nin orbital mechanics and its applications to carry out NASA\u2019s mission in\nspace-borne observation of our Earth; in fly-by, orbiting and landing of plan-\netary bodies and their satellites; in astronomical telescopes that can observe\nour galaxy and the early Universe. We continue to recruit the best and the\nbrightest graduates in this discipline from universities around the world, who\nunderstand not only the physics and mathematics of orbital mechanics but\nalso its applications of real-life missions. The Handbook of Satellite Orbits:\nFrom Kepler to GPS is exactly what is needed for all graduates of this disci-\npline.\n\nMichel Capderou\u2019s book is an essential treatise in orbital mechanics for all\nstudents, lecturers and practitioners in this field, as well as other aerospace\nsystems engineers.\n\nCharles Elachi\nDirector\n\nNASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\n\nPasadena, CA, USA\n\n\n\nPreface\n\nOf all the fields of modern science and technology, space exploration is\nthe one that most clearly displays the following fundamental contrast: on the\none hand, its theoretical basis is underpinned by long-established, historically\ntested and almost immutable, one might even say timeless, principles; on the\nother, the whole field of space science is undergoing meteoric technological\nevolution, with exponential growth, bringing with it a broad mix of commer-\ncial, political and ideological considerations. And so we have come from Kepler\nto GPS.\n\nRegarding the \u201cimmutable foundations\u201d, we know that the notion of\ngeopotential or the solution of Lagrange\u2019s equations is no easy matter. We\njust hope that, with teaching experience among the ingredients, we have suc-\nceeded in presenting these issues in a sufficiently clear and interesting way. To\nillustrate unbridled technological progress, we supply a wealth of examples.\n\nThe book falls into six main parts:\n\n\u2022 The first part, consisting of Chaps. 1\u20133, is devoted to geodesy. We begin\nwith the ellipse and its geometrical properties and work our way to the\nEarth\u2019s gravitational potential and the geoid.\n\n\u2022 The second part, Chaps. 4\u20138, focuses on the motion of the satellite, working\nfrom the ideal, Keplerian case to the real, perturbed case.\n\n\u2022 The third part, Chaps. 9\u201311, takes us into the actual running and func-\ntioning of satellites, discussing their missions and the ways that orbits are\ndesigned to fulfil those missions. We consider some novel issues, such as the\nconstant of Sun-synchronicity kh and, for recurrent satellites, the constant\n? and the index ?. Abundant illustrations are provided, always relating to\npast, present or future space programmes.\n\nVII\n\n\n\nVIII Preface\n\n\u2022 The fourth part, Chaps. 12 and 13, considers the instruments carried aboard\nthe satellite from a geometrical point of view. We begin with the different\nways of observing the Earth from a satellite, then move on to sampling,\ni.e. the conditions under which a given point on the Earth can view the\nsatellite, considering the viewing angle and frequency of visibility.\n\n\u2022 We then devote the whole of Chap. 14 to GPS. This navigation system,\nentirely satellite-based, appeals to almost all branches of modern physics.\n\n\u2022 In the final part, Chaps. 15 and 16, we leave the confines of our own planet\nto apply all these theories first to Mars, then to the other planets of the\nSolar System, and even to the natural satellites of those planets, around\nwhich artificial satellites may gravitate.\n\n?\n\nThe orbit and sampling software Ixion forms the backbone of this book. We\nfirst developed it as a teaching tool for an M.Sc. in climatology and space\nobservation, and also in the research context, as an aid to understanding\nissues of orbital elements, satellite\u2013pixel\u2013Sun configuration, and so on, which\narise when processing the data transmitted to us by our satellites. But once\nthe accuracy of Ixion had been proven in the context of real data, by the\nconfrontation with pixels, one might say, we extended it to all types of orbit\nand included some didactic features that would make it accessible and useful\nto a broader audience.\n\nThe software Ixion has since been used for preliminary studies of orbital\nstrategy, as it is known, which serve to match orbital elements in the best\npossible way to the physical phenomena we need to observe. Among the orbits\nstudied in this context, we cite the French\u2013Indian satellite Megha-Tropiques\nand the planned Mars missions Premier-07 and MEMO. Ixion is often used by\nour colleagues for calibration and validation campaigns in the field, as for the\nsatellites Calipso, MetOp-A and -B, Megha-Tropiques, and others.\n\nIxion/Web is the part of Ixion that is now accessible online. Our mapping\nsoftware Atlas has been coupled with Ixion to produce graphical representa-\ntions of orbits and their ground tracks. We hope the maps it produces will be\npleasant and useful to the reader. They should provide a refreshing change\nto the deeply saddening lack of cartographic imagination and the striking\nflatness of the projections generally used in this field.\n\nWe have selected many examples among experiments that are familiar to\nus, such as the CERES and ScaRaB instruments and the Megha-Tropiques\nsatellite. They may appear to be over-represented in the book, but perhaps it\nis better to stick to the things we know best!\n\nBecause this book focuses on space mechanics and the geometry of obser-\nvation, with all its concomitants, such as spatiotemporal sampling, there is no\nconsideration at all of the satellite as a technological object. There is not one\nword about the launch vehicles or the functioning of the onboard instruments,\napart from the geometric aspect of the swath in the latter case, since this is\ndirectly relevant to our purpose.\n\n\n\nPreface IX\n\nBy concentrating in this way on the orbits, we have made every effort\nto prove or at least explain all the formulas used. This may look some-\nwhat austere, so we have tried to brighten things up with plenty of examples\nand illustrations. The examples will show the reader some rather unexpected\norbits, while the photographs will demonstrate the level of accuracy achieved\ntoday in images acquired by satellite-borne instruments.\n\nTo liven up the whole discussion, we have also included many references\nto historical aspects, even presenting several pages of the books that founded\ncelestial mechanics and discussing some of those early results which leave us\nin admiration. And so we have come from Kepler to GPS.\n\nWith that, let me wish you a good trip into space . . . and into time.\n\n\n\nX Preface\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was accomplished in the context of my teaching at the University\nof Pierre and Marie Curie (UPMC, Paris) and my research at the Laboratoire\nde me?te?orologie dynamique (LMD), whose director, Vincent Casse?, I would\nlike to thank.

The King of the Lapiths, he behaved in a\ndecidedly reprehensible manner on the day of his wedding, causing his future\nfather-in-law to fall into a burning pit so that he would not have to pay the\ndowry.\n\nThis act was considered the ultimate crime, for it broke all the rules of\nhospitality, and indeed, it was reproved by all the gods but one. The only deity\nwho would agree to purify Ixion for the murder was Zeus, a connaisseur when it\ncame to perjury and other misdemeanours. Zeus even felt some compassion for\nthis strong-minded king, inviting him to Olympus and offering him hospitality.\nAs an exceptional sign of friendship, he bade him drink ambrosia, which made\nhim immortal.\n\nIxion admired Zeus\u2019 antics and escapades and, encouraged by the atmo-\nsphere of familiarity in the Olympian realm, began to covet Zeus\u2019 own wife\nHera. But this was where he overstepped the mark! The king of the gods cried\nout: \u201cA little respect for one\u2019s host!\u201d As a punishment, he bound him to a\nfiery wheel which whirled him forever through the skies.\n\nAs he had been made immortal, the poor fellow must still be spinning\naround up there. One may thus consider Ixion as the first of all artificial\nsatellites, and this is therefore the name we have chosen for our software.\n\nIxion is the orbitography and sampling software that forms the basis for this\nbook. Since 2010, many of the features of this software have been put online\nin collaboration with Karim Ramage at the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace\n(IPSL). This software Ixion/Web is perfectly operational. The orbital elements\nof the satellites are updated daily (NORAD data) and the calculation of the\nsatellite trajectory is thus fully accurate. For past dates, the automatically\narchived NORAD data are used.\n\nThe ground track of the satellite and instrumental swath are indicated on\nGoogle Maps, providing much detail and easy consultation. Graphic repre-\nsentations can also be obtained on standard maps, with a choice of over a\nhundred cartographic projections using the software Atlas. Another option is\n3D visualisation of the orbit with Google Earth.\n\nAt a given location, sampling tables indicate the times (day and time) of\nsatellite overpasses for the whole month, specifying conditions of viewing such\nas sight angle and solar configuration. Statistical tables provide global data\nfor the whole Earth.\n\n\n\nXII Preface\n\nIxion/Web also gives orbits and sampling for the planet Mars. Satellite\nground tracks are represented on Google Map Mars or conventional maps.\nGround tracks of satellites orbiting other planets (Venus, Mercury, etc.) or\nthe Moon can also be represented.\n\nApart from being fully operational, Ixion/Web has a clear pedagogical\ninterest as an aid to understanding satellite motion in different frames, i.e.\nGalilean or moving with the Earth. We give here four examples of graphical\nrepresentations: a 3D representation of the orbit of the satellite LAGEOS-1,\na close-up of the orbital ground track of Jason-2, an orbital ground track of\nMolniya-3-50 and an orbital ground track of Terra with swath.\n\nhttp://climserv.ipsl.polytechnique.fr/ixion.html\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 Geometry of the Ellipse . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

1\n\nGeometry of the Ellipse\n\nWe will be concerned with ellipses in two different contexts:\n\n\u2022 The orbit of a satellite around the Earth (or the orbit of a planet around\nthe Sun) is an ellipse.\n\n\u2022 A cross-section of the planet Earth containing the polar axis is an ellipse.\n\nNaturally, in both cases, this is just a first approximation. However, a prelim-\ninary study of this geometric object will prove useful before going into greater\ndetail.\n\nIn the first case, the ellipse will be viewed as a geometrical object localised\nby its focus and specified by its eccentricity e. In the second, it will arise\nrather as a flattened circle, localised by its center and characterised by the\ndegree of flattening f .\n\nEllipses can be defined in many different ways, as we shall now see. It is\nindeed a rich geometrical object.\n\n1.1 Definition and Properties\n\n1.1.1 Conic Sections\n\nConsider a cone C, with apex S, and a plane P which does not pass through\nS. Let P ? be the plane parallel to P which does pass through S. There are\nthree possible cases:\n\n\u2022 If P ? lies outside the cone, the intersection of P and C is an ellipse.\n\u2022 If P ? is tangent to the cone, the intersection of P and C is a parabola.\n\u2022 If P ? lies within the cone, the intersection of P and C is a hyperbola.\n\nIn ancient times, these conic sections were viewed as a geometrical curiosity.\n\nM.

Geometry of the Ellipse\n\nWhen he wanted to explain the orbit of Mars around the Sun, Kepler was\nthe first to rediscover the notion of ellipse that had been so carefully enun-\nciated by the Greek geometers. Later on, with the help of Newton\u2019s theory,\nastronomers were able to show that the trajectory of a body subject to a grav-\nitational force could be not only an ellipse, but also a parabola or a hyperbola.\nKepler\u2019s ellipse was thus replaced by the whole family of conic sections.\n\nWe begin by describing the many different ways of understanding conic\nsections.\n\nKnowledge of this particular curve goes back at least to Ancient Greece.\nMenaechmus1 and Apollonius of Perga2 defined the ellipse as one of the family\nof conic sections.3\n\n1.1.2 Definition and Properties of the Ellipse\n\nIn this book, we shall be interested almost exclusively in the ellipse, be-\ncause of all the conic sections, only this one constitutes a periodic trajectory.\n\nThe ellipse has many properties. We may thus choose one as the definition\nand deduce the others from it by means of rather straightforward demonstra-\ntion. In general, the first of the following is usually taken as the definition,\nwhile the others are considered as consequences.\n\nDefinition\n\n[1] The ellipse is the locus of points M in the plane such that the sum of\nthe distances MF and MF ? to two fixed points F and F ?, called the foci, is\nconstant.4\n\n1Menaechmus (????????\t, ?375 to ?325), was a Greek mathematician and member of\nPlato\u2019s Academy. He is credited by Eratosthenes with the discovery of the conic sections,\nobjects which arose in the so-called Delian problem, also known as doubling the cube (given\na cube of volume a3, construct another of volume 2a3). Menaechmus sought two numbers\nx and y such that a/x = x/y = y/2a, which leads to x3 = 2a3, by finding the intersections\nof a parabola (y = x2/a) and a hyperbola (y = 2a2/x).\n\n2Apollonius of Perga, a city in Pamphylia in Anatolia (\n???\n\n????\t ? ???????\t, ?262 to\n?180) was a Greek geometer and astronomer and a student of Euclid. He wrote an eight\nvolume work entitled Conics, part of which has come down to us directly in the Greek\nversion, and part through the Arab translation. He studied the possible intersections of a\ncone by an arbitrary plane, classifying them into the three types of conic section which still\ncarry the names he attributed to them.\n\n3The word \u201cconic\u201d comes from the Greek ko?nikos, an adjective derived from ko?nos (?\n?????\t? ??), meaning \u201cpine cone\u201d, the fruit of certain conifers.\n\n4A direct application of this definition can be used to draw an ellipse in what is sometimes\nknown as the gardener\u2019s method. Two stakes are stuck in the ground, some distance d apart.\nA non-stretch string of length ? > d is attached with one end at each stake. If we then hold\na third stake against the string and move it in such a way that the string is always taut,\nthis stake will trace out an ellipse with focal points at the two fixed stakes. The major axis\nis equal to ? and the eccentricity is d/?.\n\n\n\n1.1 Definition and Properties 3\n\nMain Properties\n\n[2a] The ellipse is an affine transformation of a circle.\n[2b] The projection of a circle on a plane is an ellipse.\n[3] The ellipse is the locus of points M such that the ratio MF/d is a\n\nconstant q, q < 1, where F is a fixed point, the focus, and d is the distance\nbetween M and a fixed straight line called the directrix.\n\n[4] The ellipse is obtained from the intersection of a cone and a plane in\nthe case specified above.\n\nOther Properties\n\nHere are a few more properties that we shall not prove here.\n[5] The ellipse is the locus of the centers of circles passing through a fixed\n\npoint F and tangent to a fixed circle, the director circle, with center F ?.\n[6] A light ray passing through one focus will reflect on the ellipse and\n\npass through the second focus.5\n\n[7] If the ends of a line segment of fixed length run along two perpendicular\nstraight lines, an arbitrary point on the segment will describe an ellipse and\nthe envelope of the segment is then an astroid.\n\n1.1.3 Applications of the Definition\n\nEllipse as a Geometrical Object\n\nFrom the definition [1], the ellipse has a center6 of symmetry O, which we\nshall call the center of the ellipse. Taking O as the origin for an orthonormal\nCartesian frame of reference (see Fig. 1.1), the various points of interest have\nthe following coordinates:\n\nOF =\n\n(\nc\n0\n\n)\n, OF ? =\n\n(\n?c\n0\n\n)\n, OA =\n\n(\na\n0\n\n)\n, OB =\n\n(\n0\nb\n\n)\n.\n\nWe use the standard terminology:\n\na = OA , semi-major axis of the ellipse ,\n\nb = OB , semi-minor axis of the ellipse , b ? a ,\nc = OF = OF ? , focal distance .\n\n5The term was introduced into scientific Latin (New Latin) by Kepler in 1603, from the\nLatin word focus, i, which means \u201ca place where fire is made\u201d. A pencil of light rays passing\nthrough one focus will converge at the other, and could start a fire there. This is indeed the\nexplanation for the name \u201cfocus\u201d (see Fig. 1.11).\n\n6The word \u201ccenter\u201d comes from Old French centre, which comes from the Latin centrum,\ni, meaning \u201ccompass point\u201d, \u201ccenter of a circle\u201d, or \u201cmidpoint of an ensemble\u201d. The word\nderives from the Greek kentron, ?? ???????? ??, a \u201cgoad\u201d, from the verb ??????, meaning\n\u201cto prick or sting\u201d. This is a rather rare example of a technical country word which became\nscientific and later assumed a very general meaning. The Latin word spread to all the Latin\nlanguages and many non-Latin ones, too.\n\n\n\n4 Chapter 1. Geometry of the Ellipse\n\ne = 0.65\n\ny Y\n\nB\n\nM\nG\n\nHOF?

(1.1)\n\nThe real number e is the eccentricity of the ellipse.\n\nEquation of the Ellipse in Cartesian Coordinates Centred on O\n\nConsider an orthonormal Cartesian frame of reference (O;x, y), centered\non O. The axis Ox is the straight line F ?F , the focal axis. Let M(x, y) be a\npoint on the ellipse and set\n\nr = FM , r? = F ?M .\n\nDefinition [1] applied to M at A yields\n\nr + r? = 2a , (1.2)\n\nand when M is at B, we obtain\n\nb2 = a2 ? c2 = a2(1? e2) . (1.3)\n\n\n\n1.1 Definition and Properties 5\n\nThe lengths r and r? are expressed in Cartesian coordinates through their\nsquares:\n\nr2 = (x? c)2 + y2 = (x? ea)2 + y2 , (1.4)\n\nr?2 = (x + c)2 + y2 = (x+ ea)2 + y2 , (1.5)\n\nand by the difference\n\nr?2 ? r2 = 4cx = 4eax . (1.6)\n\nUsing (1.2), we obtain\n\nr? ? r = r\n?2 ? r2\nr? + r\n\n= 2ex ,\n\nand finally the following expressions for r and r?, whose sum and difference\nare as given:\n\nr = a? ex , (1.7)\n\nr? = a+ ex . (1.8)\n\nNote that these expressions are very simple and do not involve any square\nroots.\n\nUsing (1.4) and (1.7), we then have\n\nr2 = (x? ea)2 + y2 = (a? ex)2 ,\n\nx2 + e2a2 + y2 = a2 ? e2x2 ,\n\nx2(1? e2) + y2 = a2 ? e2a2 ,\n\nwhence\n\nx2\n\na2\n+\n\ny2\n\na2(1? e2) = 1 , (1.9)\n\nor again\n\nx2\n\na2\n+\n\ny2\n\nb2\n= 1 , (1.10)\n\nwhich clearly reveal the role played by the semi-minor and semi-major axes.\n\n\n\n6 Chapter 1. Geometry of the Ellipse\n\nEquation of the Ellipse in Polar Coordinates Centred on F\n\nConsider first the orthonormal Cartesian frame (F ;X,Y ), centered on F ,\nwith axis FX identified with Ox and FY parallel to Oy. We then have the\nfollowing relation between the absciss\u00e6:\n\nX = x? ea .\n\nFor a point M(X,Y ) of the ellipse, (1.7) becomes\n\nr = a(1 ? e2)? eX .\n\nWe then define the quantity\n\np = a(1? e2) , (1.11)\n\nknown as the parameter or semi-latus rectum of the ellipse. It corresponds to\nthe distance between the focus F and the point of intersection of the ellipse\nwith the axis FY (which is the straight line with equation X = 0). In Fig. 1.1,\np = FG. Note that b is the geometric mean of a and p :\n\nb2 = ap . (1.12)\n\nThe equation for the ellipse can once again be written very simply as\n\nr = p? eX . (1.13)\n\nConsider polar coordinates centered on F (see Fig. 1.1). The coordinates r\nand ? of an arbitrary point M are defined by\n\nr = ?FM? = FM , (1.14)\n\n? = (FX ,FM) . (1.15)\n\nThe abscissa of M in Cartesian coordinates is then X = r cos ? and (1.13)\nyields\n\nr =\np\n\n1 + e cos ?\n. (1.16)\n\nThe equation for the ellipse in polar coordinates is thus\n\nr(?) =\na(1? e2)\n1 + e cos ?\n\n. (1.17)\n\n\n\n1.1 Definition and Properties 7\n\nNote on Conic Sections\n\nIf we always define the parameter p to be the distance between the focus\nF and the point G at which the conic section intersects the perpendicular to\nthe focal axis passing through F , the relation (1.16) can be used to define all\nthe conic sections,7 with the eccentricity discriminating between them:??\n\n?\n0 ? e < 1 , for the ellipse ,\ne = 1 , for the parabola ,\ne > 1 , for the hyperbola .\n\nNote that, for e = 0, the ellipse is a circle, and if e ? 1, the conic section\nextends to infinity.\n\n1.1.4 Demonstrating the Main Properties\n\nHere we deduce the main properties of the ellipse.\n\nDefinition [1] =? Property [2a]\nAn affine transformation or affinity with axis?, direction ?, and coefficient\n\nk (k ?= 0) is the point transformation which maps any point P in the plane\n\n7Appolonius used the following three terms to characterise conic sections, inspired by\nthe language of the Pythagoreans:\n\n\u2022 Ellipse (? ?\n\n????\t? ??\t) means \u201clacking\u201d or \u201comitted\u201d.\n\u2022 Parabola (? ??????\n??  ?\t) describes the action of throwing, and hence suggests a map-\n\nping, or comparison.\n\u2022 Hyperbola (? !?????\n??  ?\t) describes the action of throwing higher, hence invokes the\n\nidea of an excess.\n\nThe first term comes from ??, meaning \u201cin\u201d, and the verb \n??????, meaning \u201cto leave or ne-\nglect\u201d. The last two derive from the verb ?\"\n\n???, meaning \u201cto throw\u201d. The word \u201cparabola\u201d\nshould not be associated with the idea of throwing something in the sense of throwing a\nprojectile. This link between \u201cparabola\u201d and \u201cthrow\u201d was described by Galileo, but was\nunknown to the Ancient Greeks. It is interesting to note that, taken in this order, the three\nterms \u201clacking\u201d, \u201ccomparable\u201d, and \u201cin excess\u201d associated with the conic sections corre-\nspond to the values of the eccentricity as compared to unity. In fact, Apollonius introduced\nthe length p, the parameter of the ellipse, and calculated the areas of squares and rectangles\nbased on this length. With modern notation, taking the focal axis as the axis Ox, with Oy\nperpendicular to it and the origin O at the apex of the conic section, we obtain the following\nrelation for the parabola:\n\ny2 = 2px ,\n\nwhich means that the area of a square of side y is equal to that of a rectangle of dimensions\n2p\u00d7 x. For the two other conic sections, we have:\n\n\u2022 For the ellipse, y2 = 2px? (p/a)x2 .\n\u2022 For the hyperbola, y2 = 2px+ (p/a)x2 .\n\nIn comparison with the parabola, it is thus the quantity (p/a)x2 which lacks for the ellipse\nand which is in excess for the hyperbola. The name for the conic sections was introduced by\nKepler, Desargues, and Descartes, first in Latin, then in the modern European languages.\n\n\n\n8 Chapter 1.

(1.18)\n\nWhen applied to this circle, the affine transformation of axis Ox and direction\nOy (see Kepler\u2019s drawing in Fig. 1.2 and also Fig. 1.3) transforms (1.18) to\n(1.10), provided that the affine ratio is taken to be\n\nk =\nb\n\na\n=\n?\n1? e2 . (1.19)\n\nThe circle of radius a defined by (1.18) is called the principal circle of the\nellipse of semi-major axis a, itself defined by (1.10).\n\nThe area A of the ellipse can be deduced from that of the circle:\n\nA = ?ab .

Let T be the plane perpendicular to P and containing Sx.\nThe intersection of this plane T (called the plane of the page) with the cone\ncomprises the two generators SA? and SA, while its intersection with the\nplane P is the straight line AA?.\n\nConsider first the view in the plane T , as shown in Fig. 1.5.

(1.22)\n\nThe relation between a and b can also be given in terms of the flattening f ,\nwhich is defined by\n\nf =\na? b\na\n\n. (1.23)\n\nNote that the affine ratio k defined by (1.19) is k = 1? f .\nWe immediately deduce the relationship between e and f :\n\nb2\n\na2\n= 1? e2 = (1? f)2 . (1.24)\n\nThis leads to the explicit relations\n\nf = 1?\n?\n1? e2 , (1.25)\n\ne =\n?\nf(2? f) . (1.26)\n\nFigure 1.7 shows the transformation of an ellipse with fixed semi-major axis a\nwhen e is increased in regular steps of 0.1. When instead we increase f in the\nsame steps, the behaviour of the ellipse is very different, as shown in Fig. 1.8.\n\nGauss introduced the angle of eccentricity \n, defined by\n\ne = sin \n . (1.27)\n\nWe may then write\n\nb = a cos \n , c = a sin \n , p = a cos2 \n .\n\nLater we shall see how certain formulas can be made more elegant with the\nhelp of this auxiliary variable.\n\nLow Eccentricities\n\nThere are many situations in which an ellipse is very close to its principal\ncircle.

The elliptic orbit of Mars is characterised by a = 1.52366a.u. (astronomical\nunits) and e = 0.093412. The orbit looks almost circular:\n\nb/a =\n?\n1? e2 =\n\n?\n0.099564 = 0.99782 =? f = 0.0022 ,\n\nand the relative difference between a and b is 0.22%. However, the distance\nbetween the center of the almost circular ellipse and the focus (the Sun) is\nsignificant:\n\nc = ea = 0.14233 a.u.\n\nThis means that the distance fromMars to the Sun varies between 1.38133a.u.\nat perihelion and 1.66599a.u. at aphelion.\n\nIn 1600, Kepler thus formulated what was to be his first law (in 1609):\nthe orbit of Mars is circular and the Sun is not at its center. Kepler used the\nnotion of ellipse from 1603. He later wrote:\n\nI originally assumed that the orbits of the planets were perfect circles. This mistake\ncost me all the more time and effort in that it was supported by the authority of all\nthe philosophers and was indeed quite plausible from a metaphysical point of view.\n\nFigure 1.9 is one of Kepler\u2019s drawings, taken from Astronomia Nova, in which\nhe shows the orbits of Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and Mars (relative to the\nSun). They are almost circular.9 However, the orbit of Mars is quite clearly off\ncenter, as is Mercury\u2019s. See also the historical note on Kepler and the planet\nMars at the end of Chap. 15. ?\n\nExample 1.2 Calculating the lengths b and c for an ellipse specified by a and\ne in the case of the almost circular orbit of the satellite MetOp-A.\n\n? The ellipse representing the orbit of the satellite MetOp-A is specified by\nits semi-major axis a = 7,195,606m and its eccentricity e = 0.0011655. With\nthis value of the eccentricity, we obtain\n\n?\n1? e2 =\n\n?\n1? 1.3584\u00d7 10?6 = 1? 0.6792\u00d7 10?6 ,\n\n9To illustrate this property, V.I. Arnold suggests the following experiment in one of his\nbooks: Drop a droplet of tea close to the center of the cup. The waves will come together\nat the symmetric point. This is due to the definition of the foci of the ellipse, which implies\nthat waves coming from one focus of the ellipse will converge at the other.\n\n\n\n16 Chapter 1. Geometry of the Ellipse\n\nFig. 1.9 :Positions of Mars in a heliocentric frame. The planet is observed at four\n\ndifferent dates separated by time intervals that are multiples of the sidereal period of\n\nrevolution (687 days). Mars is then in the same position relative to the stars. Kepler\n\ncalculated the positions of the Earth at these dates and deduced the eccentricity of the\n\nEarth orbit. He was thus able to reconstruct the orbits of all the planets. The orbit\n\nof Mars appears almost circular but significantly off center. The orbits of Mercury,\n\nVenus, and the Earth (with the Moon) are also shown. They look circular, but the\n\nSun is not exactly at the center. It is interesting to note that the printers of the day\n\nwere averse to completely white regions in drawings, so the empty parts of illustra-\n\ntions were systematically adorned with little flowers.

We thus obtain the following values for a, b,\nand c :\n\na = 7,195,606m , b = 7,195,601m , c = ea = 8,386m .\n\nIn conclusion, the orbit is almost circular since the difference between a and\nb is only 5m for a total of 7,200km. However, the value of c, which measures\nthe distance between the center of the ellipse and the focus is 8.4 km, which\nwould be significant in any calculation of the altitude of the satellite. ?\n\n1.2 Applications and Other Characteristics\n\n1.2.1 Arc Length of an Ellipse\n\nThe affine transformation of the circle (O; a) (see Fig. 1.10) with axis Ox,\northogonal direction, and ratio b/a gives the ellipse (O; a, b). The coordinates\nof N on the circle and M on the ellipse can be expressed in terms of the polar\nangle10 u, centered on O :\n\nON =\n\n(\na cosu\na sinu\n\n)\n, OM =\n\n(\na cosu\nb sinu\n\n)\n.

Geometry of the Ellipse\n\nArc Length\n\nTo obtain the arc length of an ellipse, measured from an arbitrary origin,\nwe first calculate the element ds of the curvilinear abscissa in terms of dx\nand dy :\n\nds2 = (a2 sin2 u+ b2 cos2 u) du2 = a2(1? e2 cos2 u) du2 .\n\nThe arc length of the ellipse between A (u = 0) and M (u = ?) is then\nobtained by integration:\n\ns(?) = a\n\n? ?\n0\n\n?\n1? e2 cos2 udu . (1.30)\n\nThe value of s(?) cannot be expressed in terms of simple analytic functions.\nThis integral11 is an incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind. It can be\nobtained as the limit of an infinite series.\n\nPerimeter of the Ellipse\n\nThe perimeter L of an ellipse is obtained as a complete elliptic integral of\nthe second kind:\n\nL = 4a\n\n? ?/2\n0\n\n?\n1? e2 cos2 udu , (1.31)\n\nwhich has no simple analytic representation. Expanding in powers of the ec-\ncentricity, we obtain Lambert\u2019s formula:\n\nL = 2?a\n\n[\n1?\n(\n1\n\n2\n\n)2\ne2\n\n1\n?\n(\n1\u00d7 3\n2\u00d7 4\n\n)2\ne4\n\n3\n?\n(\n1\u00d7 3\u00d7 5\n2\u00d7 4\u00d7 6\n\n)2\ne6\n\n5\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\n]\n. (1.32)\n\nFor this elliptic integral, there are several approximate formulas with varying\ndegrees of complexity and which become more accurate as the eccentricity e\ndecreases. The simplest approximate result is the one provided by Euler:\n\nL ? ?\n?\n2(a2 + b2) , (1.33)\n\nor again,\n\nL ? ?\n[\n3\n\n2\n(a+ b)?\n\n?\nab\n\n]\n. (1.34)\n\n11Such integrals are classified into three kinds. Those of the second kind have the form\n\nE(?, k) =\n\n? ?\n0\n\n?\n1? k2 sin2 ? d? ,\n\nwith parameter k such that 0 < k2 < 1. These elliptic integrals are said to be incomplete\nwhen ? is arbitrary. When ? = ?/2, one speaks of complete elliptic integrals.\n\n\n\n1.2 Applications and Other Characteristics 19\n\nFor greater accuracy, we may use the formulas given by Ramanujan12:\n\nL ? ?\n[\n3(a+ b)?\n\n?\n(a+ 3b)(3a+ b)\n\n]\n,\n\nor again,\n\nL ? ?(a+ b)\n(\n1 +\n\n3h\n\n10 +\n?\n4? 3h\n\n)\n, where h =\n\n(\na? b\na+ b\n\n)2\n.\n\nTo first order in f , all these formulas are equivalent to\n\nL ? ?(a+ b) = 2?a\n(\n1? f\n\n2\n\n)\n? 2?a\n\n(\n1? e\n\n2\n\n4\n\n)\n, (1.35)\n\nwhich amounts to considering the ellipse as a circle with radius equal to the\narithmetic mean of the two semi-axes of the ellipse.13\n\n1.2.2 Radius of an Ellipse\n\nThe radius of an ellipse is the distance from an arbitrary point M on the\nellipse to its center O. This radius is denoted R?, since it is not constant but\nvaries with ?. The polar coordinates centered on O (see Fig. 1.10) are\n\nR? = ?OM? , ? = (Ox,OM) .\n\nThe Cartesian coordinates of M , viz.,\n\nOM =\n\n(\nx = R? cos?\ny = R? sin?\n\n)\n, (1.36)\n\ngive, using (1.10),\n\nR2?\n\n(\ncos2 ?\n\na2\n+\n\nsin2 ?\n\nb2\n\n)\n= 1 .\n\n12Sriniva?sa Aiyanga?r Ra?ma?nujan (1887\u20131920) was a highly original Indian mathemati-\ncian, considered as a genius in his field. He taught himself mathematics using a compendium\nof 6,000 theorems, most of which were given without proof. From the age of 17, and in par-\nticular during his time in England between 1913 and 1919, he established hundreds of\nformulas which he noted down without proof in his notebooks. His intuition and memory\nwere astonishing. He worked on number theory, elliptic integrals, Bernoulli numbers, and\nso on. Ramanujan established the values of ? and e using continued fractions, series, or\nextremely concise formulas.\n\n13In the words of Kepler: \u201cAny elliptic circumference is very close to the arithmetic mean\nbetween the circle of longest diameter and the circle of shortest diameter.\u201d Astronomia\nNova, Chap. LIX, p. 287. He considered only the elliptic orbits of the known bodies.\n\n\n\n20 Chapter 1.

(1.38)\n\nFor small flattening (f ? 1), we have\n\nR? ? a\n(\n1? f sin2 ?\n\n)\n, or R? ? a\n\n(\n1? e\n\n2\n\n2\nsin2 ?\n\n)\n. (1.39)\n\n1.2.3 Radius of Curvature of an Ellipse\n\nAny curve can be approximated near one of its points (provided it is not\na cusp), over an infinitesimal interval, by a circle known as the osculating\ncircle. Its radius ? is the radius of curvature. The locus of the centers of these\nosculating circles is called the evolute of the curve. Equivalently, we may define\nthe evolute of a plane curve as the envelope of all the normals to this curve\n(see Fig. 1.11). It can be shown that, at a given point, the osculating circle is\nunique.\n\nConsider an ellipse specified by the angular parameter u. Let M be a point\non the ellipse and M ? the corresponding point on the evolute. This means that\nthe circle of center M ? and radius ? = ?M ?M? is tangent to the ellipse at\nM . The vector M ?M is normal to the ellipse at M .\n\nThe normal at point M , with parameter u, is written in the following way\nin terms of the coordinates X and Y :\n\naX\n\ncosu\n? bY\n\nsinu\n? c2 = 0 . (1.40)\n\nThe parametric equation of the evolute is obtained by determining the two\nunknowns X and Y using two equations: the equation of the normal given\nby (1.40) and the derivative of this equation with respect to u. These can be\nwritten\n\naX sinu? bY cosu = c2 sinu cosu ,\n\naX cosu+ bY sinu = c2(cos2 u? sin2 u) ,\n\n\n\n1.2 Applications and Other Characteristics 21\n\nM\n\nF\n\nf = 0.200 e = 0.600\n\nM?\nF?\n\nFig. 1.11 :Radius of curvature of an ellipse.

This\ndiagram illustrates another property of the ellipse: MM ? bisects the angle FMF ?, so\nany ray of light passing through F will pass through F ? after reflection on the ellipse.\n\nand we obtain\n\naX = c2 cos3 u , bY = c2 sin3 u .\n\nIn short, the coordinates of M and M ? can be written in the form\n\nOM =\n\n(\na cosu\nb sinu\n\n)\n, OM ? =\n\n?\n??\n\na2 ? b2\na\n\ncos3 u\n\na2 ? b2\nb\n\nsin3 u\n\n?\n?? .

A point M in space\ncan be identified by the three spherical coordinates r, ?, ?, defined in the\nfollowing way. We select one axis Oz and project M to M ? on the plane xOy\nperpendicular to Oz passing through O. We then set\n\nr = ?OM? , ? = (OM ?,OM) , ? = (Ox,OM ?) ,\n\nwhere the ranges of the three coordinates are\n\nr ? [0,?) , ? ?\n[\n??\n2\n,+\n\n?\n\n2\n\n]\n, ? ?

(2.1)\n\nNow consider a sphere of radius R, centered on O. If this sphere is a represen-\ntation of the (spherical) Earth, the geometric quantities defined above have\ngeographic significance:\n\n\u2022 Oz is the polar axis and xOy is the equatorial plane.\n\u2022 The distance r = R+ h is often specified by the altitude h.\n\u2022 ? is the latitude and ? is the longitude.\n\nM.

Geodesy\n\nFig. 2.1 :British stamp issued in June 1984 to com-\n\nmemorate the 100th anniversary of the adoption of the\n\nGreenwich Meridian as Longitude Zero for the Earth.\n\nCreated by Sedley Place Design.\n\nLatitude and longitude are quite generally defined here in spherical coordi-\nnates. Circles passing through both poles are meridians (loci of points of\nconstant longitude). Circles parallel to the equatorial plane are called paral-\nlels (loci of points at constant latitude), and the parallel in the equatorial\nplane is the equator. The meridians are great circles, while all the parallels\napart from the equator are small circles.1\n\nWe apply the following conventions:\n\n\u2022 The polar axis is oriented from the South Pole to the North Pole.\n\u2022 The meridian plane xOz serving as origin is called the prime meridian,\n\nzero meridian, or (see Fig. 2.1) Greenwich meridian.2\n\n\u2022 Longitudes are measured in the right-handed trigonometric sense from 0?\nto 360? or from ?180? to +180?, which gives values [+E/?W], i.e., positive\nfor the east and negative for the west.\n\n1If they intersect at all, a sphere and a plane intersect in a circle. If the plane passes\nthrough the center of the sphere, the circle in question is a great circle, otherwise it is a\nsmall circle.\n\n2When it was officially chosen as prime meridian at the International Meridian Confer-\nence, held in Washington in 1884, the meridian passing through the Royal Observatory in\nGreenwich was already being used in most shipping charts (the British delegate declared\nat the time that, in terms of sheer tonnage, 72% of world shipping trade was using charts\nbased on Greenwich). On the other hand, when it came to land charts, there was a multitude\nof different zero meridians. Naturally, France used the Paris meridian set down by Cassini,\nwhich passed through the Paris Observatory. Italy referred to the meridian in Rome, Russia\nto the one in Pulkovo, and so on. The meridian which passes through El Hierro Island (Isla\nde el Hierro), the westernmost island of the Canaries, and hence the westernmost point\nknown to Europe before the discovery of the Americas, had the advantage that it gave only\npositive longitudes at the time. It had often been used in Europe in the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries. Even in the nineteenth century it was still to be found on several maps\nfrom central Europe.\n\n\n\n2.1 Earth Ellipsoid 27\n\nEllipsoid Year a (m) 1/f (dimensionless)\n\nDelambre 1810 6, 375, 653 334\nAiry 1830 6, 376, 542 299.3\nEverest 1830 6, 377, 206.4 300.8017\nBessel 1840 6, 377, 397.16 299.1528\nClarke I 1866 6, 378, 206.4 294.9787\nClarke II 1880 6, 378, 249.2 293.4660\nHayford International 1924 6, 378, 388.2 297\nKrassowsky 1942 6, 378, 245 293.3\n\nAIG67 1967 6, 378, 160 298.2471\nWGS72 1972 6, 378, 135 298.26\nGRS80 1980 6, 378, 137 298.257222101\nWGS84 1984 6, 378, 137 298.257223563\n\nGEM-T2 1990 6, 378, 137 298.257\nEGM96 1996 6, 378, 136.30 298.25765\nGRIM5 2000 6, 378, 136.46 298.25765\nEIGEN 2008 6, 378, 136.46 298.25765\nEGM2008 2008 6, 378, 136.46 298.25765\n\nTable 2.1 :Reference ellipsoids used in geodesy (with year of application).

Consider a pointM on the surface of the ellipsoid\n(the notion of altitude relative to this ellipsoid will be considered later). The\nintersection of an arbitrary meridian plane with the ellipsoid will be an ellipse\nwith center O. We set a = OA and b = OB (see Fig. 2.2), where A is a point\non the equator and B is the North Pole. The plane xOz is the meridian plane.\n\nThe semi-major axis a is the equatorial radius Re and the semi-minor axis\nb is the polar radius Rp. This ellipse, and hence also the Earth ellipsoid, is\nthus determined by two quantities. We choose a and the flattening f (see\nTable 2.1).\n\nFrom the symmetry of revolution, the point M can be identified by the\nlongitude specified on the sphere, but for the latitude, we must think again.\nIndeed, the latitude was obtained historically by measuring angles between\nthe directions of carefully selected stars and the local horizontal plane (or\n\n\n\n28 Chapter 2.

In Fig. 2.2, the\nlatitude of the point M corresponds to the angle between the sightline to the\nnorth (say, the pole star, sightline MN , parallel to the polar axis OB) and\nthe tangent to the ellipse at M . This angle is equal to ? = (OA, IM ), angle\nbetween the normal to the ellipse and the equatorial radius, called the geodetic\nlatitude.3\n\nThe geographic latitude, also called the astronomical latitude, which is mea-\nsured \u201cin the field\u201d, takes the plumb line as reference, rather than the normal\nto any theoretical ellipsoid of reference. The plumb line hangs perpendicu-\n\n3The word \u201cgeodesy\u201d comes from the New Latin geodesia, as attested in the sixteenth\ncentury. This in turn came from the Greek, and in particular from the prefix geo-, ? ? ??\n? ?\t, meaning \u201cthe Earth\u201d or \u201cthe country\u201d, and -desy, ? #???\t? #?????\t, meaning \u201cshare\u201d, in\nthe sense of equal shares distributed at mealtimes.\n\n\n\n2.1 Earth Ellipsoid 29\n\nlar to the equipotential surface represented by the local geoid. The difference\nbetween geodetic and geographical latitude, known as the deviation from the\nvertical, is at most 3 s of arc in regions where the geoid is particularly \u201cun-\neven\u201d. This difference must be taken into account for certain very accurate\nmeasurements that will not be considered in this book.\n\nThe geocentric latitude ? at the point M is defined relative to the center of\nthe Earth: ? = (OA,OM). This angle is used in particular to specify satellite\npositions. The various definitions of latitude are summarised in Fig. 2.2.\n\nTo find the relation between ? and ?, we introduce yet another latitude\nwith a purely geometric role, namely the parametric latitude u (see Fig. 2.2).\nConsider the principal circle of the ellipse. The parallel to Oz passing through\nM cuts the principal circle atN , a point used to define the parametric latitude\nby u = (OA,ON).\n\nThe point M is obtained from N by an affine transformation with axis\nOx, direction Oz, and ratio b/a. We thus have\n\ntan? =\nb\n\na\ntanu . (2.2)\n\nThe affine transformation conserves contact: it transforms the tangent to the\ncircle at N to the tangent to the ellipse at M . These tangents cut the axis Ox\nat the same point T . The angle (TO,TM) is complementary to ? and the\nangle (TO,TN ) is complementary to u. This gives\n\ntan? =\na\n\nb\ntanu . (2.3)\n\nWe deduce the relation between the two latitudes from (2.2) and (2.3), using\nf or e :\n\ntan? =\ntan?\n\n(1? f)2 =\ntan?\n\n1? e2 . (2.4)\n\nThese three latitudes always have the same sign at any given location. Their\nabsolute values are ordered as follows:\n\n|?| ? |u| ? |?| ,\nwith equality only at the equator or the poles.\n\nFor small values of the flattening (f ? 1), (2.4) yields\ntan? ?

Consider the values of the Earth ellipsoid WGS84 (World Geodetic System\n1984, revised in 2004, and updated by EGM96) given in Table 2.1. The values\nrequired here are Re = a, Rp = a(1? f), with f = 0.00335281:\n\nRe = 6, 378, 137.000m , Rp = 6, 356, 752.314m .\n\nThe difference between the two radii is\n\n?R = Re ?Rp = fRe = 21.285 km .\n\nFor the maximal difference in the latitude values, we obtain\n\n??0 = f = 3.35 mrad = 0.19? = 11? 32?? = 692?? ,\n\nwhich represents a difference ??0 in the field given by\n\n??0 ?

But the\ngeodetic latitude ? has the greater practical value. We use (2.3) to express\nthe relation between u and ?, while bringing in the eccentricity:\n\n1\n\ncos2 u\n= 1 + tan2 u = 1 + (1 ? e2) tan2 ?\n\n=\n1\n\ncos2 ?\n? e2 tan2 ? = 1\n\ncos2 ?\n(1 ? e2 sin2 ?) ,\n\nwhence\n\na cosu = a cos?\n(\n1? e2 sin2 ?\n\n)?1/2\n.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nsinu = tanu cosu =\nb\n\na\ntan? cos?\n\n(\n1? e2 sin2 ?\n\n)?1/2\n,\n\nwhence, using the relation b2/a = a(1 ? e2),\n\nb sinu = a(1? e2) sin?\n(\n1? e2 sin2 ?\n\n)?1/2\n.\n\nEquation (1.29) thus gives\n\nOM =\n\n?\n?????\n\nx = a\ncos??\n\n(1 ? e2 sin2 ?)\n\nz = a\n(1? e2) sin??\n(1? e2 sin2 ?)\n\n?\n????? . (2.11)\n\nThe normal to the ellipse at M cuts the axis z?Oz at I. In geodesy, the length\nIM is sometimes called the great normal (see Fig. 2.2). It is denoted by N .\n\nSince x = IM cos?, we deduce the value of N from (2.11):\n\nN = a?\n1? e2 sin2 ?\n\n, (2.12)\n\nand the plane Cartesian coordinates of M can be written in the form\n\nOM =\n\n(\nx = N cos?\n\nz = N (1? e2) sin?\n\n)\n. (2.13)\n\nWe can now obtain the coordinates of I, where OI = z ?N sin? :\n\nOI =\n\n(\n0\n\n?N e2 sin?\n\n)\n. (2.14)\n\n\n\n32 Chapter 2.

(2.15)\n\n2.1.3 Radius of Curvature\n\nThe center of the radius of curvature M ? lies between I and M . We use\n(1.43) to calculate ? as a function of ?. To begin with,\n\na2 sin2 u+ b2 cos2 u = a2(1? e2 cos2 u) = a2 1? e\n2\n\n1? e2 sin2 ?\n,\n\nwhence we obtain ?(?) as\n\n? = a\n1? e2\n\n(1? e2 sin2 ?)3/2\n, (2.16)\n\nwhich can also be written\n\n? = N 1? e\n2\n\n1? e2 sin2 ?\n. (2.17)\n\nFor small values of the flattening, (2.16) becomes\n\n?\n\na\n? 1 +\n\n(\n3\n\n2\nsin2 ?? 1\n\n)\ne2 . (2.18)\n\nIn this case, the radius of curvature is equal to the equatorial radius, whatever\nthe value of e, for two values of the latitude, viz., ? = \u00b1 arcsin\n\n?\n2/3 :\n\n? = a ?? ? ? 54.7?N or 54.7?S . (2.19)\n\n2.1.4 Radius of the Ellipse\n\nThe \u201cnatural\u201d variable to use for the radius of the ellipse, denoted R?, is\nthe geocentric latitude ?, as we saw previously [see (1.38) on p. 20]. However,\nif we wish to express this radius as a function of the geodetic latitude ?, the\nresulting formula is more involved:\n\nR?(?) = a\n\n?\n(1? e2)2 sin2 ?+ cos2 ??\n\n1? e2 sin2 ?\n= N\n\n?\n(1? e2)2 sin2 ?+ cos2 ? .\n\n(2.20)\n\nNote the relation obtained with the projection of OM on the axis Ox :\n\nR? cos? = N cos? .

The second\nof arc is equivalent to 1?? = 1 nm/60 = 30.864m.

Its longitude is ?. If S is identified\nby the geocentric latitude ? = (Ox,OS), its Cartesian coordinates are, as\nobtained in (2.1),\n\nOS =\n\n?\n?x = r cos? cos?y = r cos? sin?\n\nz = r sin?\n\n?\n? . (2.28)\n\nThe point T is the intersection of OS and the ellipsoid. If S is identified by\nthe geodetic latitude ? = (Ox, IS), its Cartesian coordinates are, adapting\n(2.15) and denoting the great normal by N = IS,\n\nOS =\n\n?\n? x = (N + h) cos? cos?y = (N + h) cos? sin?\nz =\n[\nN (1 ? e2) + h\n\n]\nsin?\n\n?\n? , (2.29)\n\nwhere h = SN is called the geodetic altitude or ellipsoidal height, that is, the\ndistance between the point S and the base N of the normal to the ellipsoid.\n\nIn the terminology of space mechanics, S represents a satellite, O the center\nof attraction (the center of the Earth), T the ground track (or geocentric\nground track), and N the nadir5 (or geodetic ground track, or subsatellite\npoint).\n\n2.2.2 Latitude Related to Geodetic Altitude\n\nThe angles used to determine these quantities are shown in Fig. 2.5. Note\nthat, although ? and ? are both related to the point S, these angles do not\nrefer to the same point on the surface of the ellipsoid.\n\n5The nadir is the direction given by the vertical, but in the downward direction. The\nopposite direction is the zenith. The word \u201cnadir\u201d comes from the Arabic na?d. ir, from the\nroot of the verb \u201cto look towards\u201d.\n\n\n\n38 Chapter 2.

[see (2.28)]. Regarding its geodetic coordinates (h, ?, ?), only\nthe longitude is easily obtained:\n\n? = arctan\ny\n\nx\n, with sign(?) = sign(y) , for [+E/?W] . (2.30)\n\nIt is more difficult to obtain h and ?, bearing in mind that they are related. Let\nus begin by examining the relationship between the geocentric and geodetic\nlatitudes of S. Equations (2.28) and (2.29) give\n\nr cos? = (N + h) cos? , r sin? =\n[\nN (1? e2) + h\n\n]\nsin? ,\n\n\n\n2.2 Altitude Relative to the Ellipsoid 39\n\nwhence\n\ntan?\n\ntan?\n= 1?

(2.32)\n\nThis immediately shows the limiting values of ? :\n\n\u2022 For h = 0, tan? = (1? e2)?1 tan? =? ? = ?T .\n\u2022 For h ? ?, tan? = tan? =? ? = ? .\n\nThe geodetic latitude of S lies between the geodetic latitude of the ground\ntrack T and its geocentric latitude.\n\n2.2.3 Determining the Geodetic Altitude and Nadir\n\nThe coordinates h and ? can be obtained iteratively, by approximation,\nor directly. We consider each in turn.\n\nIterative Method\n\nLet P be the projection of OS on the equatorial plane:\n\nP =\n?\nx2 + y2 = (N + h) cos? , (2.33)\n\nwhence the geodetic altitude h is given by\n\nh =\nP\n\ncos?\n?N . (2.34)\n\nThe projection of OS on the polar axis Oz is z = P tan?, and using (2.31),\nwe have\n\nz\n\nP\n=\n\n(\n1?

Results\n\nTable 2.4 : Iterative method for obtaining the height h and latitude ? of the nadir\n\n(subsatellite point).\n\nApproximation Method\n\nIn the triangleONS shown in Fig. 2.5, the angle atO (equal to ???N) and\nthe angle at S (equal to ???) are both small, in fact, always less than 0.19?\nfor the Earth ellipsoid. This justifies trigonometric approximations leading to\nthe following formulas:\n\n? = ? +\nf\n\n?\nsin 2? +\n\nf2\n\n?2\n\n(\n1? ?\n\n4\n\n)\nsin 4? , (2.36)\n\nh\n\nRe\n= (? ? 1) + f 1? cos 2?\n\n2\n+\n\nf2\n\n?\n\n(\n1? ?\n\n4\n\n) 1? cos 4?\n4\n\n, (2.37)\n\nusing the reduced distance ? defined by\n\n? =\nr\n\na\n, (2.38)\n\nwhere r is the distance OS and a the semi-major axis of the ellipsoid,6 here\na = Re.\n\nDirect Method\n\nThe Borkowski algorithm can be used to obtain the values of ? and h\ndirectly. It exploits the fact that this problem reduces to a fourth order poly-\nnomial equation. This is rather difficult to solve, and indeed, much more in-\nvolved than the two preceding methods, while the gain in accuracy is almost\nnegligible. The three methods agree to within 10?4 degrees for the angles.\n\n6Note that ? = 1 only corresponds to h = 0 in the equatorial plane for ? = 0. If we set\n? = 1 with ? = ?/2 in (2.37), we obtain h/Re = f , or h = Re ? Rp. At the poles, zero\naltitude h = 0 corresponds to ? = 1? f .\n\n\n\n2.2 Altitude Relative to the Ellipsoid 41\n\nSome Remarks Concerning Altitude and Latitude\n\nFor a given point S, we define the difference in latitude ?? by\n\n?? = ??(h, ?) = ?? ? . (2.39)\nWe define also the difference in altitude:\n\n?h = ?h(h, ?) = h? ? h , (2.40)\nwhere h? = ST is the geocentric altitude. Since the tangent to the ellipse\nlies outside the ellipse, h? is always greater than h (h is the smallest distance\nbetween S and the ellipsoid).\n\nWith r = OS = OT + TS = R? + h\n?, the relative distance ? is equal to\n\n(R? + h\n?)/Re. Using (1.39), we deduce that\n\nh?\n\nRe\n= ? ? R?\n\nRe\n= (? ? 1) + f 1? cos 2?\n\n2\n+ o(f2) . (2.41)\n\nComparing (2.39) and (2.36), then (2.41) and (2.37), we see that ?? is a small\nquantity, proportional to f , while ?h is another small quantity, proportional to\nf2. In the triangle SNT shown in Fig. 2.5, the arc NT is almost proportional\nto the angle at S (equal to ??), hence proportional to f , whereas the difference\nbetween the sides SN and ST depends, if we write down the distances, on\nthe square of f .\n\nFigure 2.6 shows the dependence of the latitude difference ?? = ??(h, ?)\non the latitude (varying from 0? to 90?) and the altitude (varying from 0 to\ninfinity).\n\nExample 2.2 Calculating the differences ?? and ?h, as defined above, for two\nsatellites, one in low Earth orbit (LEO) and the other in medium Earth orbit\n(MEO).\n\n? For the low Earth orbit (LEO), we choose the satellite SPOT-5 (average\nheight at the equator 822.3km, inclination i = 98.670?). Results are given\nfor latitudes in steps of 15?, starting from 0?, the extreme latitude being\n|?| = 180? ? i = 81.330?. We give the three angles ? (geocentric latitude\nof the satellite S), ?T (geodetic latitude of its ground track T ), ? (geodetic\nlatitude of the nadir N and hence of the satellite S), and also the difference\n|??|. In addition, h is the geodetic altitude and h? the geocentric altitude.

But fortunately for the human intellect, this fact has been\nknown for a long time now, and no satellites were involved in discovering or\nchecking it. However, as we shall see, it is mainly thanks to satellites that we\nhave been able to refine, to a very high level of accuracy, our knowledge of the\ntrue shape of the Earth, and indeed, the shapes of other planets in the Solar\nSystem.\n\nThe oldest description of the real world that has come down to us is to\nbe found in Homer\u2019s Odyssey. The aoidos describes Ulysses\u2019 return journey,\nwith his 10 years of wandering in the Mediterranean. The whole trip can be\nreconstructed to establish a geographical map of the world as it was perceived\n\n\n\n2.3 A Little History 43\n\nS ? ?T ? |??| h h? ?h\n(degrees) (degrees) (degrees) (degrees) (km) (km) (km)\n\nL 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 822.011 822.011 0.000\n14.963 15.059 15.048 0.085 823.341 823.341 0.000\n29.957 30.124 30.105 0.148 827.187 827.190 0.003\n44.992 45.185 45.162 0.170 832.510 832.514 0.004\n59.987 60.153 60.134 0.147 837.849 837.851 0.002\n74.905 75.002 74.991 0.086 841.777 841.778 0.001\n81.330 81.387 81.381 0.051 842.796 842.796 0.000\n?0.022 ?0.022 ?0.022 0.000 822.631 822.631 0.000\n\n?81.330 ?81.387 ?81.381 0.051 843.647 843.647 0.000\n\nM 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 20,240.459 20,240.459 0.000\n14.965 15.061 14.988 0.023 20,235.031 20,235.039 0.008\n29.874 30.040 29.914 0.040 20,226.316 20,226.338 0.022\n44.981 45.174 45.027 0.046 20,211.941 20,211.969 0.027\n55.284 55.464 55.327 0.043 20,184.322 20,184.346 0.023\n?0.027 ?0.027 ?0.027 0.000 20,124.195 20,124.195 0.000\n\n?55.284 ?55.464 ?55.327 0.043 20,208.988 20,209.010 0.023\n\nTable 2.5 :Geodetic latitude ? and geodetic altitude h for two satellites (S), one in an\n\nLEO orbit (L), like SPOT-5, and the other in an MEO orbit (M), like Navstar/GPS.\n\nComparison with geocentric quantities ? and h?. Refer to Fig. 2.5 for notation.\n\nin ancient times: a flat disk, surrounded by the World Ocean, a great river\nencircling the world.7\n\nLater on, the first suggestion that the Earth might be round also emanated\nfrom Greece. Philosophical theories, as put forward by Aristotle, had clearly\nincorporated the fact that, when a boat disappears at the horizon\u2014first the\nhull, then the sail\u2014it is because the sea surface is not flat but rounded, while\nthis was corroborated by scientific theories supported by measurement, as\npresented by Eratosthenes with his comparative observation of the noonday\nsun in Alexandria and Syene. As far as we know by juggling with the length\nunits of the day, the value found by this geometer\u2013mathematician\u2013astronomer\nfor the Earth\u2019s circumference was rather accurate.\n\nFrom a geographical point of view, the Middle Ages represent a dark pe-\nriod. In fact, very dark. The Hereford mappa mundi shows that, by 1300, the\nperception of the world had barely evolved since the time of Homer\u2014except\nfor one significant change: Jerusalem had replaced Delphi as the center of the\nworld. The so-called T and O maps, from orbis terrarum, represent the land\nmass as a T-shape, surrounded by an ocean O. These mapp\u00e6 mundi reflect\nabove all the overwhelming obscurantism of the age, founded on and serving\nthe prevailing religion.\n\n7At the exact center of this circular world was the Temple of Apollo in Delphi. The\nname Delphi, ?$ %?\n&???? ??? in Greek, is closely related to the word ? #?\n&??\t? ???\t, which\nmeans \u201cwomb\u201d.\n\n\n\n44 Chapter 2. Geodesy\n\nAnd then there was light. Or rather, the stage was lit again by the likes\nof Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. The Earth became round again, but this\ntime it lost its place at the center of the Universe.\n\n2.3.2 A French Affair\n\nIn its early stages, from 1666 (the foundation of the Acade?mie des Sciences ,\nby Colbert, under Louis XIV) up until around 1810, geodesy was a French\naffair, brilliantly developed by the learned assembly and its appendage, the\nParis Observatory. There are really three stages in this fruitful development:\n\n(a) measurement of the Earth\u2019s radius,\n(b) measurement of the flattening of the Earth,\n(c) definition of the metre.\n\nPicard\u2019s Measurement of the Earth\n\nFather Jean Picard8 carried out the first scientifically serious measurement\nof 1? of latitude in order to establish the radius of the Earth, which he as-\nsumed at the time to be spherical. With precision instruments, he used the\nmethod of triangulation9 invented by the Dutch astronomer and mathemati-\ncian Snellius. Picard measured (1669\u20131671) 1? on the meridian from Paris\nto Amiens (the so-called Paris meridian). More precisely, he established 13\ntriangles between Malvoisine to the south and Sourdon to the north, covering\n1?22?, with Villejuif\u2013Juvisy as baseline.10\n\n8Jean\u2013Fe?lix Picard (1620\u20131683) was a French astronomer and geodesist. He invented the\nsighting telescope with crosswires, which allowed him to carry out very accurate surveying,\nand in particular, levelling. Having determined the Earth\u2019s radius, as explained in the\nmain text (Mesure de la Terre, 1671), he immediately communicated his result to Newton,\nwho was thus able to check the relation between the accelerations and the squares of the\ndistances, and thereby obtained a clear confirmation of his universal theory of gravitation.\nIn another area, Picard was the first to carry out systematic measurements of the diameter\nof the solar disk. He observed its variations and sought the connection with climate change\non Earth. His series of measurements between 1666 and 1682 was continued by La Hire\nfrom 1683 to 1718.\n\n9Given a straight line distance to be measured in the field, the idea is to consider a chain\nof adjacent triangles along the straight line. The apices of the triangles are church towers\nor other features that are clearly visible from afar. The angles of these triangles are then\nmeasured, and if the length of one side is known, the lengths of the other two sides can\nbe deduced by trigonometry. This yields the required distance. The side that is actually\nmeasured is called the baseline.\n\n10In Picard\u2019s own words: \u201cThe cobbled road from the mill in Ville\u2013Juive to the pavillion\nin Juvisy, a straight line with no significant unevenness, was considered ideal as baseline for\nthis undertaking.\u201d Its length was very carefully measured in both directions by juxtaposition\nof toises. Today, this 11 km section of the D7 (previously the N7), which goes under the\nlanding strips at Orly airport, is still very straight, apart from one or two recent urban\nadjustments. Each end is commemorated by a pyramidal marker stone.\n\n\n\n2.3 A Little History 45\n\nFig. 2.7 :Sighting and measurement instruments used for triangulation. Colour plate\n\n(p. 16) taken from La Mesure de la Terre by J. Picard, Paris, 1671.\n\nHe found a value of 57,060 toises for 1? along the meridian, which corre-\nsponds to 6,372km for the radius of the Earth. This is remarkably accurate,\nwithin 0.1% of the exact value. This is certainly due in part to the quality\nof the measurements (see Fig. 2.7), but also to the fact that the region mea-\nsured is close to latitude 50?, where the radius of curvature happens to be\npractically equal to the radius of the Earth, as can be seen from (2.19).\n\n\n\n46 Chapter 2. Geodesy\n\nFig. 2.8 :Map of France (by Maraldi and Cassini de Thury) 1744. Detail of fron-\n\ntispiece. This map shows the rays observed in building up the primary triangulation\n\nnetwork. Cartographic projection: Cassini projection.\n\nFrom Sphere to Ellipsoid\n\nIn 1672, the astronomer J. Richer was sent to French Guiana.11 He noticed\nthat the mechanical clock he had brought with him, and which had been\n\n11As the radius of the Earth had been known since the previous year, the Academy sent\nJean Richer to Cayenne to observe the parallax of Mars (the angle subtended by the Earth\u2019s\ndiameter as viewed from Mars) in a joint effort with Picard, who had remained in Paris.\nBy thus measuring the distance to Mars, Kepler\u2019s third law allows one to deduce the sizes\nof the planetary orbits. So the length scale of the whole Solar System was at this point\nunderpinned by the Villejuif\u2013Juvisy baseline!\n\n\n\n2.3 A Little History 47\n\nscrupulously adjusted to \u201cbeat seconds\u201d at the Paris Observatory, was losing\n2min every day (the expression battre la seconde in French indicates that the\nperiod is 2 s). He attributed this failing to a reduction in weight, and for him\nthis could have only one explanation: the equator was further from the center\nof the Earth than Paris. He thus suggested that the Earth was flattened.\n\nShortly afterwards, Newton and Huygens independently showed, in 1687\nand 1690, that if the Earth\u2019s innards were more or less fluid, its daily rotation\nought to transform the sphere into an ellipsoid, flattened along the polar axis.\nNewton obtained a value of f = 1/230 by considering a uniform distribution\nof matter within the ellipsoid, while Huygens obtained f = 1/576 by assuming\nthat the mass of the Earth was concentrated in a central core.\n\nIn 1668, J.D. Cassini12 observed the flattening phenomenon on Jupiter,\nwhich is indeed considerably flattened along the polar axis (f = 1/18), and\nhe measured it later for Saturn.\n\nTo measure the flattening effect on Earth, the French Academy of Sciences\ndecided in 1683 to extend the Picard meridian to the north as far as Dunkerque\nand the south to Collioure, whence it would extend right across France. This\n\n12The name Cassini will come up several times during this section. Indeed, there was a\ngenuine dynasty of outstanding astronomers, often numbered with Roman numerals like\nthe crowned heads of Europe:\n\n\u2022 Gian Domenico Cassini (1625\u20131712), known to the French as Jean Dominique Cassini,\nor Cassini I, was actually of Italian origin (from Nice). He soon became famous for his\nwork on geodesy, and especially on astronomy, with his very accurate observations of\nthe planets Mars and Jupiter. He set up tables of the Galilean moons of Jupiter, a\nfundamental step in the determination of longitudes, because the eclipses of these satel-\nlites constitute instantaneous signals for an Earth-based observer. So it was really the\n\u201ctransfer of the century\u201d when Louis XIV called Cassini to Paris in 1669 to entrust him\nwith the foundation and the running of the Paris Observatory. In 1679, the observatory\nbegan to publish La Connaissance des Temps, a publication that is still alive today and\nwhich lists the positions of the heavenly bodies to the greatest possible accuracy. Cassini\ncontinued his observation of the moons of Jupiter, work which allowed Olau?s Ro?mer\nto show that the speed of light was not infinite. He also improved observations of the\nMoon and Saturn. This was the Cassini who gave his name to the Cassini Division of\nSaturn\u2019s rings and also to the Cassini space probe, designed to explore Saturn and its\nenvironment.\n\n\u2022 Jacques Cassini (1677\u20131756), or Cassini II, was the son of Jean Dominique. He pursued\nhis father and Picard\u2019s geodetic measurements, but the publication of De la grandeur\net de la figure de la Terre (1722), in which he made a mistake over the flattening of the\nEarth, was later to reduce his scientific status. This was the Cassini who instigated the\nscientific dispute between the Cassini dynasty and Newton.\n\n\u2022 Ce?sar Franc?ois Cassini de Thury (1714\u20131784), or Cassini III, was the son of Jacques.\nAfter assisting his father with his geodetic measurements, he devoted himself to car-\ntography. See Fig. 2.8. In 1750, Louis XV asked him to map the whole of the kingdom.\nThis is the Cassini who is remembered for the Cassini projection and the Cassini map\nof France.\n\n\u2022 Jacques Dominique Cassini (1748\u20131845), or Cassini IV, was the son of Ce?sar Franc?ois.\nHe was to finally publish the map of France in 1790.\n\nFrom 1669 to 1793, the Cassinis ran the Paris Observatory, either officially or unofficially,\neach son succeeding his father.\n\n\n\n48 Chapter 2. Geodesy\n\nwork was carried out from 1700 to 1718 under the supervision of J. Cassini,\nMaraldi, and La Hire, see Fig. 2.8. Measurements implied a degree of latitude\nthat was longer in the south than in the north. This in turn suggested an\nellipsoid that was stretched along the polar axis, with f = ?1/95 (f is negative\nif b > a), the opposite of what is shown in Fig. 2.4.\n\nThis was the beginning of a 20 year feud between supporters of Newton\nand those of the Cassinis: was the Earth shaped like an apple or a lemon?13\n\nBetween the north and the south of France, the change in latitude is not\nsignificant enough to be able to obtain a reliable result. On the recommenda-\ntion of the French Academy of Sciences, the Count of Maurepas, Secretary of\nState for the Marine, sent two expeditions to the geodetic limits of the world,\none polar, the other equinoctial:\n\n\u2022 P.L.M. de Maupertuis,14 A.C. Clairaut, and A. Celsius measured 1? in\nLapland, on the frontier between Sweden and Finland, in 1736 and 1737.\n\n\u2022 L. Godin, C.M. de la Condamine, and L. Bouguer measured 1? in Peru (in\na region that has now become part of Ecuador), from 1736 to 1744, under\nvery difficult conditions.\n\nAt the same time, in 1739 and 1740, Cassini de Thury and Father La Caille\nwent back to Picard\u2019s meridian, and then from 1750 to 1754, La Caille went\nto the Cape of Good Hope and measured 1? in the southern hemisphere.\n\nWe can exploit these results to work out the flattening (see Table 2.6).\nUsing (2.16), the ratio of two radii of curvature, ?1 at ?1 and ?2 at ?2, yields\n\n?1\n?2\n\n=\n\n(\n1? e2 sin2 ?2\n1? e2 sin2 ?1\n\n)3/2\n.\n\nExpanding to first order in e2, we obtain\n\n?1\n?2\n\n= 1? 3\n4\ne2 (cos 2?1 ? cos 2?2) .\n\nSince the ratio of the radii of curvature is equivalent to the ratio of the mea-\nsurements ?LM for 1\n\n?, and since e2 is almost equal to 2f , this means that\n\nf =\n2\n\n3\n\n1??LM1/?LM2\ncos 2?1 ? cos 2?2\n\n. (2.42)\n\n13Traditionally, the contrast is illustrated by: mandarin or lemon? There seems to be an\nanachronism here, since the word \u201cmandarin\u201d did not appear in French until 1773.\n\n14Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (1698\u20131759), a French physicist, led the expedition\nto Lapland. In so doing, he earnt these two graceful lines from Voltaire:\n\nVous alla?tes ve?rifier en ces lieux pleins d\u2019ennui\n\nCe que Newton connut sans sortir de chez lui.\n\n[In this soulless landscape you are sure to construe\n\nWhat Newton in his college lodgings always knew.]\n\nWhile there is probably no connection with this typical irony, Maupertuis subsequently\npublished, in 1744, his famous Principe de moindre action (Principle of least action).\n\n\n\n2.3 A Little History 49\n\nName of degree Latitude ? ?LM (toises) ?LM (km)\n\nLapland +66? 20? 57, 438 111.949\nParis +49? 29? 57, 074 111.239\nPeru ?01? 30? 56, 746 110.600\nCape ?33? 18? 57, 037 111.167\n\nTable 2.6 :Results found for the degree of latitude ?LM between 1736 and 1754, for\n\ndifferent values of the average latitude ?, in degrees [+N/?S]. The value of ?LM is\ngiven in toises, together with the modern equivalent in kilometres.\n\nIf we calculate the flattening from the measurements (?LM1, ?1) in Peru and\n(?LM2, ?2) in Paris, we obtain\n\n?LM1\n?LM2\n\n= 0.99425 , cos 2?1 ? cos 2?2 = 1.15506 ,\n\n=? f = 2\n3\n\n5.4769\u00d7 10?3\n1.15506\n\n= 3.31696\u00d7 10?3 = 1\n301\n\n.\n\nThe measurement at the Cape of Good Hope was not retained. Its value was\noverestimated because the vertical was affected by the presence of mountains\nnearby.\n\nThe calculation of f using the Lapland degree gave results that differed too\nmuch to be accepted by the scientific community (f = 1/123 and f = 1/207),\nwhereupon the Swedish Academy opted for a new expedition to Lapland in\n1801, which would give ?LM = 57, 196 toises, i.e., 0.42% less than the first\nmeasurement.\n\nThe use of (2.42) to calculate f is extremely sensitive to the accuracy of\nthe measurements. If we assume that the latitudes ?1 and ?2 are known with\ncertainty and the degree in Paris ?LM2 measured exactly, a relative error of\n0.1% in the degree in Peru ?LM1 (or an error of just 57 toises per degree)\nwould lead to an error of 17.3% in f . We find the following results:\nfor ?LM1 = 56, 803 toises, 1/f = 364.6,\nfor ?LM1 = 56, 689 toises, 1/f = 257.0.\n\n\n\n50 Chapter 2. Geodesy\n\nFig. 2.9 :Commemorating the revolution: for all time,\n\nfor all peoples.\n\nAs a result of all this state-of-the-art geodesy, France was the first country\nin the world to draw up a highly accurate map of its own territory, known as\nthe Cassini map.15\n\nDefinition of the Meter\n\nA tous les temps, a? tous les peuples (for all time, for all peoples, see\nFig. 2.9), in the universal spirit of the French Revolution which characterised\nwhat was happening in France at the time, there was born the idea of offering\nhumanity a single consistent system of physical units.\n\nSince the length of a pendulum which \u201cbeats the second\u201d is not indepen-\ndent of the latitude,16 the Assembly decided on 30 March 1791 that the unit\nof length would be one ten-millionth part of the Earth meridian, based on\na proposal by a committee whose members were Borda, Lagrange, Laplace,\nMonge, and Condorcet. The astronomers Delambre and Me?chain were re-\nquested to make accurate measurements of the meridian arc from Dunkerque\nto Barcelona, towns separated by \u201c9 and 2 thirds degrees\u201d on the Paris merid-\nian, and both situated by the sea.\n\n15This map, already mentioned earlier, used a scale of 1/86,400 (one line for 100 toises). It\ncomprised 182 sheets to cover the whole kingdom. Cassini de Thury used a novel projection,\nnow called the Cassini projection, in which he plotted lines perpendicular to the Paris\nmeridian. These lines are not parallels, i.e., they are not the loci of points at constant\nlatitude, but great circles (for a spherical Earth). The perpendicular line passing through\nthe Paris Observatory goes from Granville to Strasbourg. This projection is the transverse\naspect of the projection known in French as the plate-carre?e (flat square) projection.\n\n16In a field with acceleration due to gravity equal to g, the period T of a pendulum of\nlength l is given by T = 2?\n\n?\nl/g in SI units. With T = 2 s, this gives l = g/?2 numerically.\n\nAs g varies between the equator and the pole, l varies from 0.991 to 0.996m. We note that\nthe metre was chosen close to the length of this pendulum, whereas a doubled metre would\nhave been close to the toise.\n\n\n\n2.3 A Little History 51\n\nThe process of triangulation was carried out17 from June 1792 to the end\nof 1798,18 with 115 triangles and two baselines, the Melun baseline (from\nLieusaint to Melun) and the Perpignan baseline (from Salses to Vernet).\n\nThe result was proclaimed in June 1799. The quarter meridian, as calcu-\nlated from these measurements, was\n\nL\n(?\n2\n\n)\n= 5, 130, 740 toises ,\n\nwhich was thus equal, by definition of the new unit of length, to\n\nL\n(?\n2\n\n)\n= 10, 000, 000m .\n\nThe official conversion rate was thus fixed at\n\n1 Cha?telet toise = 1.9490363m .\n\nThe law instating the metre19 was signed on 10 December 1799 (19 frimaire\nAn VIII in the revolutionary dating system).\n\nUsing Delambre and Me?chain\u2019s ellipsoid (a = 6, 375.738m, 1/f = 334),\nwhich gives this definitive value for L(?/2), the last column of Table 2.2\nshows the values of the meridian arc as a function of latitude. These can then\nbe compared with current values. The relative error introduced by Delam-\nbre et Me?chain is a mere 0.02%, which attests to the high quality of these\nmeasurements.20\n\n2.3.3 Dynamical Geodesy\n\nModern geodesy begins with Clairaut. With his The?orie de la figure de\nla Terre, tire?e des principes de l\u2019hydrostatique (Theory of the Earth\u2019s shape,\nbased on the principles of hydrostatics, 1743), he laid the foundations of dy-\nnamical geodesy: measurements of the acceleration due to gravity should be\nused, like the measurement of degrees of latitude, to determine the shape of\nthe ellipsoid. The shape of the Earth depends on its rate of rotation along the\npolar axis and the distribution of mass within it.\n\n17The angles were measured to an accuracy of 1?? of arc using Borda\u2019s repeating circle\nmethod, with instruments made by his assistant Lenoir.\n\n18It was not a good time to be carrying out this kind of expedition. In the thick of the\nrevolution, hauling strange-looking instruments to the tops of church towers or onto the\nbattlements of castles was unnecessarily intriguing for the local populations. There were\nmany unfortunate incidents, with material being sabotaged and surveyors arrested, among\nother things.\n\n19Given the delays in completing the measurements, a provisional metre had been adopted\non 1 August 1793. This metre would give L(?/2) = 5, 130, 430 toises.\n\n20Once it had been determined relative to the Earth ellipsoid, the metre was then fixed\nby the General Conference on Weights and Measures (Confe?rence Ge?ne?rale des Poids et\nMesures CGPM). In 1889 (the first CGPM), the metre was defined by the prototype de-\nposited at the Archives de France. In 1960 (the 11th CGPM), it was defined in terms of\na particular wavelength of light emitted by krypton 86. Since 1983 (the 17th CGPM), the\nmetre has been defined relative to the speed of light (see Sect. 6.10).\n\n\n\n52 Chapter 2.

In 1810, he expanded the\ngravitational potential of the Earth in spherical harmonics and the coefficients\nof this expansion provide a much better representation for the imperfections\nin the Earth\u2019s shape when compared with a sphere. The notion of the Earth\u2019s\nshape was then replaced by the \u201cgeoid\u201d. This is the equipotential surface\nwhich best fits the mean level of the oceans.\n\nOn 4 October 1957, Sputnik-1 was put into orbit (see the commemorative\nstamp in Fig. 2.10), and this marked the beginning of a new era of space\ngeodesy.\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nGeopotential\n\n3.1 Some Preliminaries\n\n3.1.1 Reference Systems\n\nConsider a reference frame centered on the Sun and with axes pointing\nto distant (fixed) stars. This is a Copernican frame, which we denote by ?0.\nAny frame ?1 in uniform translational motion relative to ?0 is a Galilean\nframe. In this kind of frame, experiment shows that Newton\u2019s second law1 is\nperfectly satisfied:\n\nF =\nd(mv)\n\ndt\n, (3.1)\n\nwhere F is the force applied to a body of massm and dv/dt is the acceleration\nof the body.\n\nConsider a frame ? with origin at the center of the Earth and axes parallel\nto the axes of the frame ?1. Strictly speaking, this is not a Galilean frame,\nbecause the motion of the Earth around the Sun is neither linear nor uniform.\n\n1Isaac Newton (1643\u20131727) was an English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer.\nIn 1687, he stated his three laws of motion in Philosoph\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica:\n(1) the principle of inertia, (2) his famous second law, which says that, in a Galilean frame,\nthe force is equal to mass times acceleration, and (3) the principle of action and reaction.\nIt can be shown that (1) is a special case of (2) and that (3) can be deduced from (2). The\nfundamental second law (2) was not expressed in exactly this way by Newton. Combined\nwith Kepler\u2019s law of elliptical orbits, the second law can be used to derive Newton\u2019s universal\nlaw of gravity [see (4.115)\u2013(4.117)]. Newton\u2019s work dominated the eighteenth century, in\nmathematics (analysis, solution of equations) and in physics, especially in optics, with the\npublication of Opticks. Regarding Newton\u2019s date of birth, it is interesting to note that\n25 December 1642 on the Julian calendar, which was still used in England at the time,\ncorresponds to 4 January 1643 on the Gregorian calendar.\n\nM.

Geopotential\n\nHowever, this motion is nevertheless slow, with one round trip per year, and\nabove all, it is perfectly well known, so there is no difficulty in calculating the\nresulting apparent accelerations. In the following, this pseudo-Galilean frame\n? will be treated as a Galilean frame moving with the Earth.\n\nIn this book, we shall use two frames with origin O at the center of the\nEarth:\n\n\u2022 The Galilean (pseudo-Galilean) frame ? we have just defined, fixed relative\nto the orthonormal triad (O;xG, yG, zG), where OzG is the polar axis and\nOxG points in a fixed direction in space, i.e., toward a distant star. This\nis called an Earth-centered inertial (ECI) frame, or Earth-centered space-\nfixed (ECSF) frame.\n\n\u2022 The terrestrial (non-Galilean) frame ?T, which is needed to describe fixed\npoints on the Earth, fixed relative to the orthonormal triad (O;xT, yT, zT),\nwhere OzT = OzG is the polar axis, while OxT rotates with the Earth,\nremaining fixed in the prime meridian through Greenwich. This is called\nthe Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF) frame.\n\nTheory and Practice\n\nThe frames ECI and ECEF are used to set up all the equations in this\nbook from the standpoint of space mechanics. The definitions here are theo-\nretical and didactic. In contrast, the practical and technical realisation of these\nframes, denoted respectively by ICRF and ITRF, is the work of astronomers\nand geodesists. They are explained briefly in an appendix to this chapter (see\nSect. 3.6).\n\n3.1.2 Review of Work and Potential\n\nWork, Force Field, Potential\n\nThe work done by a force F applied at a point M is the scalar quantity\n\ndW = F \u00b7dl ,\nwhere dl is the displacement of the point of application of the force from M to\nM ?. In an orthonormal frame, with F (X,Y, Z) and dl (dx, dy, dz), the scalar\nproduct gives\n\ndW = Xdx+ Y dy + Zdz .\n\nThe total work done when the point of application of the force moves from A\nto B is\n\nW =\n\n? B\nA\n\nF \u00b7dl .\n\nA point M is said to be subjected to a force field if, throughout its domain\nof application, a force F (X,Y, Z) can be associated with each position of the\npoint M(x, y, z).\n\n\n\n3.1 Some Preliminaries 55\n\nIf there is a function V (x, y, z) such that the components of the force\nF (X,Y, Z) can be expressed in the form\n\nX =\n?V\n\n?x\n, Y =\n\n?V\n\n?y\n, Z =\n\n?V\n\n?z\n,\n\nthroughout the region of definition, the field is said to derive from a potential .\nIn this case, the force field is said to be conservative. Using the vector operator\ngradient, denoted by grad or ? and defined by dV = grad V \u00b7dl, we can then\nwrite\n\nF = gradV ,\n\nwhence dW becomes\n\ndW = grad V \u00b7dl ,\nwhich represents the exact differential dV :\n\ndW = dV .\n\nIntegrating between points A and B,\n\n? B\nA\n\ndW = WBA = V (B)? V (A) .\n\nThis shows that the work done by the force in going from A to B, denoted by\nWBA , depends only on the values of the potential V at the points A and B,\nand not on any of the intermediate values taken along the intervening path.\nThe function V is only defined up to an additive constant.\n\nEquipotential Surface\n\nAn equipotential surface is a surface of the form\n\nV (x, y, z) = constant .\n\nThis has the following properties:\n\n\u2022 No work is done by displacement on a given equipotential surface, which\nshows that the component of the force tangent to the surface is zero. An\nequipotential surface is an equilibrium surface.\n\n\u2022 For the same reason, i.e., the fact that F \u00b7dl = 0, the force is normal to\neach equipotential surface.\n\n\u2022 Two equipotential surfaces cannot intersect, otherwise work could be done\nwithout ever leaving one of the equipotential surfaces.\n\n\n\n56 Chapter 3. Geopotential\n\nPotential Energy\n\nThe potential energy U is defined in the following way in terms of the work\ndone by a conservative force field on a moving point:\n\n? B\nA\n\ndW = WBA = U(A)? U(B) .\n\nHence, U = ?V and the relationship with F is\n\nF = ?grad U . (3.2)\n\nThis expression involving the potential energy can be used to define the me-\nchanical energy E as the sum of the potential energy U and the kinetic energy\nT . Indeed, we can write dW in two different ways:\n\ndW = ?d U ,\n\ndW = F \u00b7dl = mdv\ndt\n\n\u00b7dl = d\n(\n1\n\n2\nmv2\n)\n\n= dT .\n\nHence, dU +dT = 0. For an isolated system subjected to a conservative force\nfield, we thus establish conservation of mechanical energy:\n\nE = T + U = constant . (3.3)\n\nWe usually set U(?) = 0.\nWhen E is not constant, energy is dissipated and the force is said to be\n\ndissipative.\n\n3.2 Gravitational Potential and Field\n\n3.2.1 Gravity\n\nThe law of gravity, or universal law of gravitational attraction, established\nby Newton, states that two point bodies A and B, with masses M and m,\nrespectively, will each exert an attractive force on the other that is propor-\ntional to their mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance\nbetween them:\n\nfA?B = ?fB?A = ?G\nMm\n\nr2\ner , (3.4)\n\nwhere fA?B is the force exerted by A on B and AB = r = rer. The grav-\nitational constant G is not used as such in space mechanics. Instead, we use\nthe specific gravitational constant ?, which is the product of G and the mass\nof the relevant attracting body:\n\n? = GM . (3.5)\n\n\n\n3.2 Gravitational Potential and Field 57\n\nThe relation (3.4) is symmetric. In order to distinguish the role of one of\nthe two bodies, we may express the fact that body A, for example, creates a\ngravitational field to which body B is subjected. This field g is such that\n\nfA?B = F = mg ,\n\nor in terms of ?,\n\ng = ? ?\nr2\n\ner . (3.6)\n\nThere is a function U such that\n\nF = ?grad U = ??U\n?r\n\ner ,\n\nThis can be obtained by integrating over r :\n\nU = ?\n?\n\nF \u00b7dr = ?m?\nr\n, with U(?) = 0 . (3.7)\n\nWe then introduce the quantity U = ?U/m. To sum up, U is the potential\nenergy of the mass m in this force field, the gravitational field. U is then the\ngravitational potential produced by the mass M at distance r :\n\nU =\n?\n\nr\n. (3.8)\n\nIn astronomy and geodesy, the potential U is defined like this so that the\nleading term in the potential, viz., ?/r, is positive [see (3.28)].\n\n3.2.2 Gauss\u2019 Theorem\n\nIn the last section, we obtained the field and gravitational potential pro-\nduced by a point body of mass M located at A and acting on another point\nbody of mass m at a point B. For a continuous distribution of matter, we\nmust then carry out an integral to obtain the force exerted on B. For a given\nconfiguration, Gauss\u2019 theorem gives the result directly without the need for\nsuch an integration.\n\nProof of Gauss\u2019 Theorem\n\nThere are several ways to prove Gauss\u2019 theorem.2 We shall use a method\nbased on the idea of solid angle. We consider a closed surface S, enclosing a\n\n2Carl Fiedrich Gau\u00df (1777\u20131855) was a German astronomer, mathematician, and physi-\ncist. He was extremely precocious and interested in astronomy from an early age. He in-\nvented a method for calculating the orbital elements of the planets (see the note about\nPiazzi), then developed powerful methods for handling the problems of celestial mechan-\nics, such as the theory of least squares, in his work Theoria motus corporum coelestium\n(1809). In mathematics, he invented congruences (modulo) and studied quadratic forms, er-\n\n\n\n58 Chapter 3. Geopotential\n\nvolume ? . We can thus define an inside and an outside. We then consider\na surface element dS with unit normal n pointing outwards. The flux of an\narbitrary vector g through this surface element is defined as\n\nd? = g\u00b7dS , with dS = n dS .\nThe total flux of g out through the surface S is then given by the integral\nover the whole closed surface S, viz.,\n\n? =\n\n?\nS\n\ng\u00b7dS .\n\nWe consider a surface S surrounding a distribution of masses: the different\npoints Ai are each attributed a mass Mi. The field created by each mass Mi\nat a point B is then\n\ngi = ?GMi\nAiB\n\nAiB3\n,\n\nwhereAiB is the vector from Ai to B and AiB its length. The flux leaving S is\n\n? =\n\n?\nS\n\ng\u00b7dS\n\n= G\n\n?\nS\n\n?\ni\n\nMi\nAiP\n\nAiP 3\n\u00b7dS\n\n= G\n?\ni\n\nMi\n\n?\nS\n\nn \u00b7 AiP\nAiP 3\n\ndS ,\n\nwhere P is a point running over S. Now,\n\nn \u00b7 AiP\nAiP 3\n\ndS =\ndS cos?i\nAiP 2\n\n=\nd?\n\nAiP 2\n= d?i ,\n\nwhere ?i is the angle between the normal and AiP and d? is the projection of\ndS on the plane perpendicular to AiP . The quantity d?i is then the element\nof solid angle, represented by the infinitesimal cone with apex Ai and base\nthe surface element dS (or d?, which comes to the same thing).\n\nThe integration over d?i is independent of the surface S. We thus take a\nsphere of center Ai and radius R. This gives\n\nror analysis (bell-shaped curve, 1821), regular polygons, conformal representations, spherical\ntrigonometry, and the curvature of surfaces (1827). He revolutionised the field of geodesy\nby introducing and developing novel methods, and he was not afraid to go out into the\nfield, e.g., setting up the cadastral survey of the Hanover region between 1817 and 1821.\nIn physics, he carried out fundamental work on magnetism (Allgemeine Theorie des Erd-\ngeomagnetismus, published in 1839), electricity (Gauss\u2019 theorem), and optics (Gaussian\noptics). His contemporaries called him the Prince of Mathematicians. So who was the king?\n\n\n\n3.2 Gravitational Potential and Field 59\n\n?i =\n\n?\nd?i =\n\n?\nd?\n\nR2\n=\n\n1\n\nR2\n\n?\nd? =\n\n4?R2\n\nR2\n= 4? .\n\nOn the other hand, an external mass, i.e., with Ai outside S, produces a field\nwhose flux through S is zero. Indeed, a cone with apexAi standing on a surface\nelement dS determines two opposing flux elements whose total contribution\ncancels, since d? is a scalar whose sign depends on the scalar product.\n\nFinally, letting Mint =\n?\n\nint Mi, the sum of the masses contained within\nthe surface S, the flux out of S is\n\n? = ?4?G\n?\nint\n\nMi ,\n\nand Gauss\u2019 theorem can be stated as follows:?\nS\n\ng\u00b7dS = ?4?GMint . (3.9)\n\nFor a continuous distribution of masses represented by the density ? at each\npoint of space, Mint is given by\n\nMint =\n\n???\nV\n\n?(r)d? ,\n\nwhere the triple integral extends over the whole volume V .\n\nCalculating the Field Using Gauss\u2019 Theorem\n\nIf the density depends only on r (the magnitude of r), i.e., if the mass dis-\ntribution is spherically symmetric, the field it produces will also have spherical\nsymmetry:\n\ng(r) = ?g(r)?r\nr\n.\n\nIt is then straightforward to calculate the flux. For the surface S, we choose a\nsphere of radius r containing all the mass Mint. From the symmetry, the field\ng must be orthogonal to S at every point. Remembering that r is constant\nover the whole surface S, we obtain\n\n? =\n\n?\nS\n\ng\u00b7dS =\n?\nS\n\n?g(r)?r\nr\n\u00b7n dS = ?g(r)?\n\n?\nS\n\ndS = 4??g(r)?r2 .\n\nApplying Gauss\u2019 theorem (3.9), we find that\n\n4??g(r)?r2 = ?4?GMint ,\n\nwhence the gravitational field g is given by\n\ng(r) = ?GMint\nr\n\nr3\n. (3.10)\n\nWe thus obtain the following very important result: the field produced by a\nspherically symmetric mass distribution is the same as would be produced by a\npoint mass of the same value located at the center of the spherical distribution.\nThis property results from the fact that the forces are central and go as r?2.\n\n\n\n60 Chapter 3. Geopotential\n\nGravitational Field of the Earth\n\nIf we treat the Earth as spherical and assume that its density only depends\non the distance from the center O, then at a point outside or on the surface\nof the Earth, and at distance r from O, the field produced there is\n\ng(r) = ?? r\nr3\n\n= ? ?\nr2\n\ner , with? = GM , (3.11)\n\nwhere M is the total mass of the Earth. In this case, ? is called the geocentric\ngravitational constant.\n\n3.2.3 Gravity and Weight\n\nIf we assume once again that the Earth is spherically symmetric and in\naddition that it is not moving relative to a Galilean frame, the equipoten-\ntial surfaces will be concentric spheres. But as Galileo pointed out, the Earth\nis spinning on its axis, so a point subjected to the force of gravity will also\nsuffer an inertial force relative to a non-Galilean frame fixed relative to the\nEarth. This is how the Earth\u2019s shape was transformed and flattened during\nits formation. Its outer envelope is an equipotential surface: its points are in\nequilibrium. If we ignore tides, currents, and winds, the ocean surface provides\na faithful image of this equipotential surface,3 and it is generally taken as the\nzero altitude. This geoid naturally extends beneath the continents. The sur-\nface of a motionless lake4 also represents an equipotential surface, at another\naltitude, and the plumb line, which defines the local vertical, will be exactly\nperpendicular to this surface.\n\nOn such a surface, the potential U is constant. However, as mentioned\nabove, the gravitational field is not constant on this equilibrium surface. In-\ndeed, it is stronger at the poles than at the equator, since Rp < Re, while\nthe centrifugal acceleration is zero at the poles and maximal at the equator.\nWe shall calculate the gravitational potential produced by a flattened planet,\nthen the weight potential which takes into account the Earth\u2019s rotation. By\nintegrating this potential, we will obtain the weight as a function of latitude.\n\nMaupertuis was the first to make a clear terminological distinction be-\ntween gravity and weight, a distinction that was subsequently taken up by\nD\u2019Alembert5 and Clairaut6:\n\n3In 1742, MacLaurin showed that the ellipsoid of revolution spinning on its minor axis\nwas the only geometrical shape that could meet requirements. Later, Poincare? showed that,\nfor much faster rotation, there were other possibilities, but they are not relevant to the\nplanets.\n\n4The water is in equilibrium so there is no reason why it should flow from left to right,\nor from right to left!\n\n5Jean le Rond d\u2019Alembert (1717\u20131783) was a French mathematician, physicist, and\nphilosopher. He published Recherche sur la pre?cession des e?quinoxes et sur la nutation de\nl\u2019axe de la Terre dans le syste?me newtonien, in 1749. In 1743, he had stated the principle\nthat carries his name in his Traite? de dynamique. With Diderot, he wrote the Encyclope?die.\n\n6\u201cI make here the same distinction as M. de Maupertuis (La Figure de la Terre\nde?termine?e, etc.) between weight and gravity. By weight, I understand the natural force\n\n\n\n3.3 Calculating the Geopotential 61\n\n\u2022 Gravity is the sum of the attractive effects acting on a mass according to\nthe universal law of gravitation.\n\n\u2022 Weight is the resultant of gravity and the action of the centrifugal acceler-\nation due to the Earth\u2019s rotation.\n\nIn other words, gravity is the field measured in the frame ?, while weight is\nthe field measured in the frame ?T. Any body on the Earth is subjected to\nweight, while a satellite in orbit around the Earth is subjected to gravity.\n\n3.3 Calculating the Geopotential\n\n3.3.1 Potential Element\n\nThe temporal variation in the terrestrial mass distribution (due to land\nand ocean tides and phenomena linked to internal geophysical processes) and\nthe variation in the direction of the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation (motion of the\npoles) are not taken into account here. We only consider the averaged effect\nof these phenomena over a given period and calculate the static geopotential\nproduced by a fixed mass distribution (see Fig. 3.1).\n\nLet O be the center of the Earth and (O;x, y, z) a coordinate system\nfixed relative to the Earth, like ?T, where Oz is the polar axis and (xOy)\nthe equatorial plane. Let S be a point outside the Earth (the satellite). Its\nposition is specified by the three spherical coordinates r, ?, ? [see (2.28)]. The\nangles ? and ? represent the longitude and geocentric latitude of the point S.\nIf T is a point inside the Earth, it can also be specified by its three spherical\ncoordinates ?, ?, ?, where ? is the magnitude of OT , ? the longitude, and ?\nthe geocentric latitude.\n\nT\n\nx\n\nO\n\nS\n\ny\n\nz\n\nFig. 3.1 :Obtaining the gravitational potential at a point S.

Geopotential\n\nWe now have the standard relations giving components in Cartesian coor-\ndinates:\n\nOS\n\nr\n=\n\n?\n? cos? cos?cos? sin?\n\nsin?\n\n?\n? , OT\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n? cos? cos?cos? sin?\n\nsin?\n\n?\n? . (3.12)\n\nLet ? be the angle between the two radial vectors, viz.,\n\n? = (OS,OT ) ,\n\nso that the distance D between the two points S and T is\n\nD2 = ?TS?2 = r2 ? 2r? cos ? + ?2 ,\n\nand\n\nD = D(T, S) = r\n\n[\n1? 2?\n\nr\ncos ? +\n\n(?\nr\n\n)2]1/2\n.\n\nThe scalar product OS \u00b7 OT yields\ncos ? = sin? sin? + cos? cos? cos(? ? ?) .\n\nThe potential element dU produced at S by the mass element dM located at\nT , at a distance D from S, is given by (3.8) as\n\ndU =\nd?\n\nD\n= G\n\ndM\n\nD\n. (3.13)\n\n3.3.2 Obtaining the Potential by Integration\n\nThe potential U we hope to calculate here is obtained by summing all\nthe potential elements produced by the mass elements making up the mass\ndistribution. The mass element dM is associated with the point T which\nranges over the whole of the Earth:\n\nU = U(S) =\n\n?\nEarth\n\ndU = G\n?\nT?Earth\n\ndM(T )\n\nD(T, S)\n. (3.14)\n\nThe expression for D arising in the calculation of the potential is given as a\nfunction of ? by\n\n1\n\nD\n=\n\n1\n\nr\n\n1?\n1? 2?\n\nr\ncos ? +\n\n(?\nr\n\n)2 . (3.15)\n\nThis expression can be expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials (see the\nappendix at the end of the chapter). The expansion converges if ?/r < 1.\n\n\n\n3.3 Calculating the Geopotential 63\n\nThe calculation is thus valid if S remains strictly outside the sphere containing\nall the mass elements. We may then write\n\n1\n\nD\n=\n\n1\n\nr\n\n??\nl=0\n\n(?\nr\n\n)l\nPl(cos ?) , (3.16)\n\nwhere Pl is the l th Legendre polynomial (or Legendre polynomial of degree l).\nReplacing cos ? by its value in terms of spherical coordinates, the angles ?, ?,\n?, and ?, or more precisely ?, ?, and ???, we now use the Legendre addition\nformula:\n\nPl(cos ?) = Pl(sin?) \u00b7 Pl(sin?)\n\n+2\n\nl?\nm=1\n\n(l ?m)!\n(l +m)!\n\nPlm(sin?)Plm(sin?) cosm(? ? ?) ,\n\nwhere Plm are the associated Legendre functions. We thus obtain 1/D in terms\nof the six spherical coordinates. Substituting this expression into (3.16), then\ninto (3.14), and using R to denote the equatorial radius Re = a of the Earth,\nwe obtain:\n\nU(r, ?, ?) = G\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\ndM(?, ?, ?)\n\nD(r, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)\n\n= G\n1\n\nr\n\n?

In the present context, they can be\nused to give a graphical decomposition of the geopotential.\n\nOne can gain an idea of the way the spherical functions vary by plotting\nthe points on the sphere where they vanish. To do so, the spherical harmonics\nare divided into three groups: the zonal harmonics, the sectorial harmonics,\nand the tesseral harmonics:\n\n\n\n3.3 Calculating the Geopotential 65\n\n\u2022 Zonal harmonics. These are obtained when m = 0. In this case,\n\nFl0 = Pl0(sin?) = Pl(sin?) , Gl0 = 0 , Hl0 = Pl(sin?) .\n\nHence, Hl0(?, ?) = Hl0(?) depends only on the latitude. Zonal harmonics\nhave axial symmetry about the axis through the poles. In particular, they\ntake into account the flattening of the Earth. They divide the Earth up\nalong the geographic parallels.\n\n\u2022 Sectorial harmonics. These are obtained when m = l. In this case,\n\nPlm(sin?) = Pll(sin?) =\n(2l)!\n\n2ll!\n(cos2 ?)l/2 .\n\nThis function of ? is never zero, except at the poles. Hence, Hll is only\nzero for certain values of ?. The sectorial harmonics only vanish on the\ngeographic meridians and one generally gives a picture of the sphere that\nlooks like an orange separated into segments that meet at the poles.\n\n\u2022 Tesseral harmonics. These are obtained in all other cases. The zeros produce\na kind of spherical chessboard pattern, marked out by the meridians and\nparallels.\n\nNormalised Coefficients\n\nGeopotential models are generally expressed in terms of normalised co-\nefficients C?lm, while the coefficients Clm used above are referred to as non-\nnormalised.

These points will be discussed below.\n\nFor the Earth as it really is (dropping the ellipsoid approximation), the\nnumerical values of Jl are given in Table 3.2 (but see also Table 3.3). These\ncoefficients are usually referred to in the literature as Jn terms. So for the\ngeoid, the coefficients C10 (or J1), C11, and S11 are zero, while the coefficients\nC21 and S21 (? 10?9), C22, and S22 (? 10?6) are nonzero.\n\nRegarding orders of magnitude, we see that the J2 term is about 10\n3\n\ntimes smaller than the leading term, but 103 times greater than the following\ncoefficients. To sum up, considering the expansion of the potential given by\n(3.28), we observe that (see Fig. 3.2):\n\n9When geodesists realised that the shape of the Earth was not exactly ellipsoidal, they\nchose to call it the geoid (Listing in 1873), which is tautological: it is like saying that the\nEarth is Earth-shaped!

However, if we require a more accurate formula\nin terms of the geodetic latitude and without approximation, we can use\nSomigliana\u2019s formula discussed below.\n\n3.4.3 Clairaut\u2019s Formula\n\nThe J2 term in the expansion of the geopotential, which can be related\nto the difference in moments of inertia of the Earth about the polar axis and\nabout an equatorial axis, as can be seen from (3.25) and (3.26), cannot be\nmeasured directly. But without waiting for the advent of the artificial satellite,\nit could be determined from geodetic considerations, exploiting the properties\nof equipotential surfaces.\n\nRelation Between J2 and Flattening\n\nClairaut14 made the assumption that the Earth was in hydrostatic equi-\nlibrium in its rotation about its own axis. It follows that, for any point on the\nEarth\u2019s surface, taken as an ellipsoid, the potential is constant. Let us choose\na point at the pole (r = Rp = b) and a point at the equator (r = Re = a):\n\nUT(r = a, ? = 0) = UT(r = b, ? = ?/2) .\n\nEquation (3.31) yields\n\n?\n\na\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1\n\n2\nJ2\n\n)\n+\n\n?2\n\n2\na2 =\n\n?\n\nb\n\n(\n1? a\n\n2\n\nb2\nJ2\n\n)\n.\n\nThe quantities f and J2 are much smaller than 1. Neglecting small quantities\nto second order, the right-hand side becomes\n\n?\n\na\n(1 + f)\n\n[\n1? J2(1 + 2f)\n\n]\n? ?\n\na\n(1 + f ? J2) ,\n\nin weightless conditions. For such a fast-spinning version of Earth, we thus have (??/?)2 =\n288, or ?? ? 17?. With such an angular speed, the day lasts 17 times less than on the\nreal Earth, i.e., a mere 84.5min. Furthermore, this is equal to the period of rotation of a\nterrestrial satellite at zero altitude, as we shall see in (5.9) of Chap. 5.\n\n14Alexis Claude Clairaut (1713\u20131765) was a French astronomer and mathematician. He\nentered the French Academy of Sciences at the age of eighteen, after astonishing the as-\nsembly by his investigation of geometric curves. He soon turned his attention to geodesy\nand celestial mechanics, publishing The?orie de la figure de la Terre tire?e des principes de\nl\u2019hydrostatique in 1743. This explored the differences in the acceleration due to the weight\nat the poles and the equator. He then studied the three-body problem and published his\nThe?orie de la Lune in 1752. He was also one of the first to investigate gravitational pertur-\nbations (see the historical note on the return of Halley\u2019s comet in Sect. 6.8.1).\n\n\n\n76 Chapter 3. Geopotential\n\nwhich gives Clairaut\u2019s first equation:\n\nJ2 =\n2\n\n3\nf ? 1\n\n3\nma , (3.33)\n\nwhere the dimensionless quantity\n\nma =\n?2a3\n\n?\n(3.34)\n\nis easily found to be ma = 3.461 \u00d7 10?3. If we consider the flattening to be\ngiven by f = 1/298.3, we obtain the value of J2 to first order as\n\nJ2 = 1.0814\u00d7 10?3 .\n\nThis is very close15 to the value of J2 given in Table 3.2.\n\nRelation Between J2 and Weight\n\nHistorically, it was the quantity f that scientists sought to calculate. That\nis, they hoped to determine the flattening without having to measure the\nEarth\u2019s meridian. They thus had to find some way of expressing J2, and this\ncould be done by measuring ?, the acceleration due to the weight, at various\npoints on the Earth\u2019s surface. Now using (3.32), we can calculate ? = ?e at\nthe equator and ? = ?p at the pole:\n\n?e =\n?\n\na2\n\n(\n1 +\n\n3\n\n2\nJ2\n\n)\n??2a ,\n\n?p =\n?\n\nb2\n\n(\n1? 3a\n\n2\n\nb2\nJ2\n\n)\n? ?\n\na2\n(1 + 2f ? 3J2) .\n\nNeglecting small quantities to second order, the difference gives\n\n?p ? ?e =\n?\n\na2\n\n(\n2f ? 9\n\n2\nJ2\n\n)\n+?2a .\n\nReplacing ?e by ?/a\n2 in the small terms, since g = ?/R2 to a first approxi-\n\nmation, we obtain\n\n?p ? ?e\n?e\n\n= 2f ? 9\n2\nJ2 +mg ,\n\n15Carrying out the calculation to second order in the small quantities, we obtain\n\nJ2 =\n2\n\n3\nf ? 1\n\n3\nmb ?\n\n1\n\n3\nf2 +\n\n2\n\n21\nfmb ,\n\nwhere mb = ?\n2a2b/? = ma(1?f). The numerical result is J2 = 1.082634\u00d710?3, implying\n\na relative error of 7\u00d7 10?6 compared with the value of J2 given in the text.\n\n\n\n3.4 Weight Field and Potential for the Ellipsoid 77\n\nwhere\n\nmg =\n?2a\n\n?e\n. (3.35)\n\nThe value of mg is equivalent under the given approximations to that of ma\nin (3.34). We set\n\n? =\n?p ? ?e\n\n?e\n,\n\na dimensionless quantity which one might call the flattening of gravity. This\ncan be accurately obtained by measuring ? at the equator and the pole. We\nthus have another relation for J2, known as Clairaut\u2019s second equation:\n\nJ2 =\n2\n\n9\n(2f +ma ? ?) . (3.36)\n\nClairaut\u2019s Formula\n\nComparing the two equations (3.33) and (3.36) and eliminating J2, we\nobtain Clairaut\u2019s formula:\n\nf =\n5\n\n2\nma ? ? . (3.37)\n\nThis formula can be used to determine f from two measurements of ?. Nu-\nmerical calculations give\n\n?e = 9.7804 ms\n?2 , ?p = 9.8322 ms?2 ,\n\n? = 5.296\u00d7 10?3 ? 1/189 , ma = 3.467\u00d7 10?3 ? 1/288 ,\n\nf = 3.373\u00d7 10?3 ? 1/297 .\n\nGiven the approximations made here, this result can be considered to be\nhighly satisfactory.\n\nClairaut\u2019s formula16 shows that the flattening f can be determined from\nweight measurements, since ? and a are known. To obtain f , it is not neces-\nsary to know anything about the composition of matter within the ellipsoid.\n\n16Clairaut was pursuing an idea of Newton and Huygens that the Earth\u2019s rotation, weight,\nand flattening were all related. Indeed, he formulated this idea, but not in the way discussed\nhere. He did not use the concept of potential, invented later by Lagrange, and did not exploit\nthe coefficient J2 in this form.\n\n\n\n78 Chapter 3. Geopotential\n\n3.4.4 Somigliana\u2019s Formula\n\nEquation (3.32) giving the weight field, or Clairaut\u2019s relations, are approx-\nimate results, to first order in f . The Italian geodesists Pizetti (1894) and later\nSomigliana (1922) were to take up the same problem in a global way. The main\nidea was to define a body with the shape of an ellipsoid of revolution such that\nthe ellipsoid was itself an equipotential surface of its own field. Although the\nfinal formula looks simple and elegant, the calculation leading to it is long and\narduous, and goes well beyond the scope of the present book. Somigliana\u2019s for-\nmula gives the normal weight field at the surface of the ellipsoid as a function\nof the geodetic latitude ? :\n\n?(?) =\na?e cos\n\n2 ?+ b?p sin\n2 ??\n\na2 cos2 ?+ b2 sin2 ?\n, (3.38)\n\nwhere ?e and ?p are the values of the weight at the equator and the pole, as\ndiscussed earlier. It can also be written in the form\n\n?(?) = ?e\n1 + k sin2 ??\n1? e2 sin2 ?\n\n, (3.39)\n\nwhere\n\nk =\nb\n\na\n\n?p\n?e\n\n? 1 (3.40)\n\nis the Somigliana constant. This formula can also be given in numerical form.\nThe values of the various terms depend to some extent on the reference ellip-\nsoid (see Table 2.1):\n\n\u2022 With GRS80, the values are:\n\na = 6, 378, 137 m , b = 6, 356, 752.3141 m ,\n\ne2 = 0.00669438002290 , k = 0.001931851353 ,\n\n?e = 9.7803267715 ms\n?2 , ?p = 9.8321863685 ms?2 ,\n\n?(?) = 9.780327\n(\n1 + 5.3024\u00d7 10?3 sin2 ?+ 5.8\u00d7 10?6 sin2 2?\n\n)\n. (3.41)\n\n\u2022 With WGS84, the values are:\n\n?e = 9.7803253359 ms\n?2 , k = 0.001931853 .\n\nOnce above the ellipsoid, the weight ?h(?) at altitude h is given by a relation\ninvolving ?(?) and ?e :\n\n?h(?) ? ?(?)\n?e\n\n= ?2h\na\n\n[\n1 + f +ma +\n\n(\n?3f + 5\n\n2\nma\n\n)\nsin2 ?\n\n]\n+ 3\n\n(\nh\n\na\n\n)2\n.\n\n(3.42)\n\n\n\n3.5 Geoid 79\n\n3.5 Geoid\n\n3.5.1 Gravity Anomalies\n\nA gravimeter can be used to measure the weight field at many points on\nland, and with suitable precautions, at sea. Furthermore, as we shall see in\nlater chapters, the orbit of a satellite is sensitive to the distribution of mass in\nthe regions it overflies. When accurately measured, the discrepancy between\nthe theoretical position according to a given model and the actual position can\nbe used to deduce the spherical harmonic coefficients of the geopotential. In\naddition to this method, used for over 40 years now, since the beginning of the\nspace age, with ever more refined models, one should also mention altimetry\nmeasurements made by ocean satellites over the past 20 years or so.\n\nOnce the data has been processed and the transition made from weight to\ngeopotential, the result is a map of anomalies, i.e., the difference in altitude (or\nequipotential surface) between the geoid and the ellipsoid. Such maps, each\nassociated with a geopotential model, reveal ripples not exceeding a 100m or\nso. Figure 3.5 shows the map resulting from the American model EGM96. The\nmain negative anomalies are south of India (?105m), in Tibet (?65m), in\nthe Antarctic south of New Zealand (?55m), and in the Carribean (?50m).\nThe main positive anomalies are in New Guinea (+75m), in Iceland (+70m),\nand halfway between Madagascar and the Antarctic (+60m).\n\nIt should be noted that these anomalies are not correlated with the relief of\nthe visible land mass. They are explained as manifestations of the non-uniform\ndensity of matter in the Earth\u2019s mantle.\n\nLong-wavelength anomalies are identified by satellite, while smaller-scale\nanomalies are found by ground-based measurements. These anomalies are\ncalled gravity anomalies and they are measured in milliGal.17\n\n3.5.2 Satellites and Geodesy\n\nThe first artificial satellite, Sputnik-1, was launched by the USSR on 4\nOctober 1957 and only emitted a signal for three weeks.18 However, by study-\ning the trajectories of subsequent satellites,19 launched shortly afterwards,\nthe zonal coefficient J2 was determined by the Czechoslovakian geodesist E.\n\n17The unit of acceleration in CGS units is the Gal in homage to Galileo. Hence, 1 Gal =\n1 cm s?2. Geodesists use the milliGal, 1mGal = 10?5 ms?2.\n\n18Orbital elements for the first few revolutions are: altitude at perigee hp = 228 km,\naltitude at apogee ha = 947 km, inclination i = 65.128?, period T = 96.17min (?T =\n1.80 s/day), perigee on latitude 41? N. Last signal 26 October 1958. Reentry 4 January\n1958.\n\n19Sputnik-2 was launched on 4 November 1957. Orbital elements for the first few revo-\nlutions are: hp = 225 km, ha = 1,671 km, i = 65.310?, T = 103.75min (?T = 3.08 s/day),\nperigee on latitude 40? N. Reentry 14 avril 1958. Sputnik-3 was launched on 15 May 1958.\nOrbital elements for the first few revolutions: hp = 226 km, ha = 1,881 km, i = 65.188?,\nT = 105.95min (?T = 0.75 s/day), perigee at latitude 45? N. Reentry 6 April 1960.\n\n\n\n80 Chapter 3. Geopotential\n\nFig. 3.5 :Anomalies of the geoid in the EGM96 model. This map, using the plate-\n\ncarre?e projection, represents the anomalies of the geoid (in meters) relative to the\n\nreference ellipsoid, as described by the US model EGM96. The maximal depression\n\n(?105m) is south of India, while the highest point (+75m) is in New Guinea. Note\nthat the relief of land masses and anomalies are not correlated, except near the\n\nAndes mountain range. Credit: The NASA GSFC and NIMA Joint Geopotential\n\nModel. NASA, NIMA, Ohio State University.\n\n\n\n3.5 Geoid 81\n\nBuchar in 1958. The value was quite close to predictions calculated from\nEarth-based measurements. The US satellite Vanguard-1, launched on 17\nMarch 1958, was able to evaluate for the first time the discrepancy between\nthe ellipsoid and the geoid. This important harmonic of degree 3 corresponds\nto a raising of the North Pole by 15m above the ellipsoid and a lowering of the\nSouth Pole by the same amount.20 The J4 term and a few others were subse-\nquently established after 1960. The methods used to determine the coefficients\nJn are discussed further in the historical note in Sect. 6.7.\n\nIn 1961,W. Kaula produced a complete model of degree 4, i.e., involving all\nthe coefficients Clm and Slm: a sectorial harmonic, coefficient of the associated\nLegendre function P22, accounts for an elevation of the geoid around 165\n\n?E\nand 15?W and a depression around 75?E and 105?W. These points mark out\nfour equal sectors on the equator,21 since we are dealing with the function\nPlm in the case l = 2 and m = 2. This point is further discussed in Sect. 7.4\non geostationary satellites (see Fig. 7.12).\n\nOur knowledge of the Earth\u2019s gravitational potential has moved ahead\nvery quickly since this time. Geodesists have not only taken advantage of all\navailable satellites, but they have also sent up their own dedicated satellites.22\n\nA considerable improvement came with the advent of satellite-borne radar\naltimeters, which could describe the ocean surface (the geoid) relative to the\norbit. The first were the US military satellites GEOS-3, Seasat, and Geosat.\n\nSince 1980, the geopotential has been better measured above the oceans\nthan above the continents. Subsequently, the European satellites ERS-1 and 2,\nfollowed by the French\u2013US satellites TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 and 2\nhave refined the measurements. The latter measure the sea level (whose mean\nrepresents the geoid) relative to the reference ellipsoid with an accuracy be-\n\n20At the time, this was considered a scoop: the Earth was pear-shaped. Given the scale of\nthese discrepancies, just 15m compared with a radius of 6,400 km, this was perhaps slightly\nexaggerated!\n\n21D. King-Hele summed this up in a little refrain of his own invention:\n\nWhen you cut a slice\nThrough the polar ice\n\nThe Earth is like a pear.\nBut sliced along the equator\nShe looks like a potato \u2013\n\nA giant pomme de terre.\n\n22Among these, the US series GEOS (Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite), GEOS-1\n(Explorer-29), GEOS-2 (Explorer-36), PAGEOS, LAGEOS, with passive ranging (PA) or\nlaser rangling (LA), which followed on from the satellites Echo-1 and Echo-2 (balloon-\nborne), ANNA-1B (Army, Navy, Nasa, Air Force, the first satellite to emit flashes), ADE-A\n(Atmospheric Density Explorer, Explorer-19), Beacon Explorer-1 (BE-B, Explorer-22, or\nS-66a, the first satellite equipped with laser reflectors), and Beacon Explorer-2 (BE-C,\nExplorer-27). After 1970, came the French satellites Starlette and Stella, launched in 1975\nand 1993, the Japanese satellite EGP (Experimental Geodetic Payload), also called EGS-1\n(Earth Geodetic Satellite or Ajisai , meaning \u201chydrangea\u201d in Japanese), launched in 1986,\nand the Russian satellite Fizeau (Meteor-2-21), launched in 1993.\n\n\n\n82 Chapter 3. Geopotential\n\nFig. 3.6 :Artist\u2019s\n\nview of the satel-\n\nlites GRACE-A and\n\nB, showing their\n\nmicrowave rang-\n\ning system.

The quality of the altimeters used is important, but\nthe accuracy with which the satellite orbit is established is just as fundamen-\ntal, and this is possible thanks to the potential models involving spherical\nharmonics of a very high degree.\n\nA radical change came about in the year 2000. Until then, satellites were\nin relatively high orbits, e.g., 5,900km for LAGEOS, 800km for Starlette,23\n\nto minimise any atmospheric friction. But from this date, drag compensation\nsystems have made it possible to maintain satellites in relatively low orbits\nthat are all the more sensitive to gravity anomalies.\n\nThe satellite CHAMP (Challenging Microsatellite Payload for geophysical\nresearch and applications) can determine the geoid to an accuracy of 10 cm\n(and 0.5mGal for gravity). This improvement by a factor of 10 over previous\nmissions is largely due to its low orbit (450 km), continuous GPS monitoring\nof the orbit, and a highly sensitive onboard accelerometer.\n\nThe GRACE mission (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) com-\nprises two twin satellites GRACE-A and B, which follow one another around24\n\non the same orbit, separated by a distance of 200 km. The low orbit (480km)\nand accurate measurement of the distance between GRACE-A and B, to\nwithin a few micrometres, has led to even better results: the geoid is known to\nwithin 1 cm on a spatial scale of 200 km (see Fig. 3.6). This is so accurate that\nwe can now produce monthly maps of the geoid and monitor the evolution of\nlarge water masses, such as the major river basins.\n\n23The pleasant name Starlette is a nice example of a contorted acronym: Satellite de\nTaille Adapte?e avec Re?flecteurs Laser pour les Etudes de la Terre.\n\n24Whence the nickname of Tom and Jerry given by the mission team.\n\n\n\n3.5 Geoid 83\n\nFig. 3.7 :Artist\u2019s view\n\nof the satellite GOCE.\n\nThe shape is designed\n\nto offer minimal resis-\n\ntance to atmospheric\n\nfriction. The image\n\nshows the ions ejected\n\nby the drag compen-\n\nsation system. Credit:\n\nESA.\n\nThe satellite25 GOCE (Gravity field and steady state Ocean Circulation\nExperiment) has improved our knowledge of the geoid still further, with a\nvery low orbit (200km) and a gradiometer comprising six accelerometers with\nan accuracy of 10?12ms?2. The satellite is equipped with an ion motor which\ncounteracts the forces of atmospheric friction in real time. Thanks to thrusts\nof a few mN from its drag compensation system, the satellite is effectively in\npermanent free fall (Fig. 3.7).\n\nSlightly further head, the LICODY project (Laser Interferometry for Core\nand Ocean Dynamics) plans to use laser ranging between satellites in a for-\nmation.\n\nWe may say that space geodesy has finally become a \u201cdialectic\u201d science\nin the sense that geopotential models are better known by localising satellites\nand studying their trajectories, and the position of the satellites is better\ndetermined by improved potential models.\n\n3.5.3 Development of Geopotential Models\n\nThe Main Models\n\nThe first satellite data were integrated into existing models and, from 1970,\ncertain models were established exclusively on the basis of space data. The\nSAO SE-1 model (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory-Standard Earth),\nconsidered to be the first satellite-only model, presented a degree 8 expansion\nof the geopotential in 1966. In 1973, the SE-3 model (degree 24) used the\nfirst laser ranging measurements to establish the distances to satellites. The\nNWL model (Naval Weapon Laboratory) was mainly based on satellites in the\nTransit series. There followed many other models, among which we shall focus\n\n25In the space community, GOCE is generally pronounced \u201cgo-chay\u201d.\n\n\n\n84 Chapter 3. Geopotential\n\non the US models GEM, JGM, OSU, EGM, and GGM, and the European\nmodels GRIM and EIGEN.\n\nThe GEMmodel (Goddard Earth Model) was established by NASA\u2019s God-\ndard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in the United States as a reaction to the\nclassified US military models. The first model GEM-1 was published in 1972,\nexpanding the potential to degree 12. The GEM-T2 model, published in 1990,\nexploited the data from 31 satellites. It gave a model with all coefficients up\nto degree 36, and some up to degree 50, and it also provided a very high order\nexpansion for the tides.\n\nThe JGM model (Joint Gravity Model) was produced jointly by NASA\nand the University of Texas. In 1994, JGM-2 (degree 70) amended GEM-\nT3 (degree 50), itself successor to GEM-T2, with the first results from\nTOPEX/Poseidon, and JGM-3 integrated the data from other satellites such\nas LAGEOS-2.\n\nThe EGM model (Earth Gravity Model) is the result of a collabora-\ntion between GSFC-NASA, NIMA (National Imagery and Mapping Agency),\nand OSU (Ohio State University), which has established many models, from\nOSU68 to OSU91. In 1996 came EGM96S of degree 70, with data provided\nsolely by satellites, and EGM96 of degree 360, adjoining geophysical data.\nThey used data from 40 satellites, including satellite to satellite measurements,\nwith the GPS constellations26 and TDRSS. The latest model EGM2008 was\nbased mainly on GRACE data to achieve an expansion up to degree 2190.\n\nSince 2002, the GGM model (GRACE Gravity Model) has been developed\nby the University of Texas using only data from GRACE: accelerometer, at-\ntitude, and distance between the two satellites (K-band range-rate).\n\nIn Europe, the GRGS (Groupe de Recherche en Ge?ode?sie Spatiale) in\nFrance and the DGFI (Deutsches Geoda?tisches Forschungsinstitut) in Ger-\nmany have worked jointly to produce the GRIM model (GR for GRGS and\nIM for the institute in Munich). The first model was GRIM1, published in 1975\n(degree 10). In 2000, there followed the GRIM5-S1 and GRIM5-C1 models, the\nfirst based solely on satellite data27 and the second using all data. The latter\nmodels were superseded by the EIGEN model (European Improved Gravity\nmodel of the Earth by New techniques),28 produced by the GFZ-Postdam\nand the GRGS-Toulouse. In 2002, EIGEN-1S amended GRIM5-S1 with the\ndata from CHAMP, supplemented by LAGEOS-1 and 2, Starlette, and Stella.\nOther models were to come, using data from the GRACE mission. In 2008,\n\n26The satellites Navstar/GPS-35 and 36 (or USA-96, 100), launched in 1993 and 1994,\nare equipped with laser reflectors.\n\n27The satellites used were Starlette, EGP (Ajisai), LAGEOS-1 and 2, Geosat, SPOT-2\nand 3, ERS-1 and 2, Stella, Westpac-1 (WPLTN-1, West Pacific Laser Tracking Network),\nTOPEX/Poseidon, GFZ-1 (GeoForschungsZentrum), D1-C, D1-D, GEOS-3, Meteor-3-07,\nNova-3, Etalon-1 and 2 (Kosmos-1989 and 2024), and PEOLE.\n\n28This is another acronym with subtle connotations, recalling the German word Eigenwert\nintroduced into mathematics by Hilbert and transformed to \u201ceigenvalue\u201d in English. The\nEnglish word corresponding to eigen is \u201cown\u201d, from the Old English a?gen.\n\n\n\n3.5 Geoid 85\n\nthere was the complete EIGEN-GL05C model of degree and order 360 (cor-\nresponding to a wavelength of 1?, or ?/2 = 55 km). In 2011, the EIGEN-6\nmodel incorporated data from GOCE and LAGEOS: EIGEN-6S model (de-\ngree 240) and EIGEN-6C model (degree 1420) with gravity data and altimetry\ndata. In 2012, it was amended29 to produce EIGEN-6C2 (degree 1949). The\ndevelopment of the European model is summarised in Table 3.4.\n\nNaturally, current models take into account the tides and the atmosphere.\nThey also take into consideration the time variations of the first spherical\nharmonic coefficients30 which are due to isostatic adjustment, in a process\ncalled post-glacial rebound,31 and other factors relating to climate change.\n\nComparison of Geopotential Models\n\nGeopotential models cannot be compared term by term beyond degree 5.\nTwo models can have rather different terms and yet still have a very close\nfinal result: different weightings of the spherical harmonics can lead to very\nclose results. Beyond degree 16, even the signs of the coefficients can change\nfrom one model to another, without there being any harmful effect on the\nrestitution of the geoid and satellite tracking. This highlights a problem when\ntruncating series: the coefficients of a model of degree 10 do not correspond\nto the coefficients of the first 10? in a model of degree 20.\n\nAs an example, Table 3.3 gives the coefficients C?l 0 for seven models men-\ntioned above, in fact, coefficients of order 0 and degree l from 2 to 10. We\n\n29EIGEN-6C2 is a combined global gravity field of a maximum degree/order 1949 which\nhas been inferred from the combination of the following data:\n\n1.

Credit: Agen-\n\nzia Spaziale Italiana\n\n(ASI).\n\n3.5.4 Evaluation of the Geocentric Gravitational\nConstant\n\nThe geocentric gravitational constant ? = GM plays a key role in space\nmechanics. It can be obtained to very high accuracy, well above what can be\nachieved for the universal constant of gravitation G.32 The first values for ?\nwere given by Kepler\u2019s third law applied to the lunar orbit. More and more\nprecise values were obtained using the space probes Ranger, Mariner, and\nVenera, then satellites, preferably with high altitude, since lower satellites are\nsubject to non-gravitational effects.\n\nA breakthrough was made in the 1980s with the advent of the tech-\nnique known as Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR), which consists in measuring\nthe distance from the Earth to the Moon using a laser. At the present time,\n\n32Henry Cavendish (1731\u20131810), the British physicist and chemist, was the first to obtain\na precise value for G, which he published in 1798 in a famous paper entitled Experiments to\ndetermine the density of the Earth. He used a subtle method: instead of taking advantage of\nvery large masses (like those who, at the time, sought to measure the deviation of a plumb\nline by a mountain), he used a torsion balance with a very fine thread, suspending two\nsmall metal weights (50 g). Bringing two large lead balls (30 kg) to a distance of 15 cm, he\nmeasured the torsion of the thread, using a mirror to create a \u201clight lever\u201d, and deduced G\nfrom the period of the motion (? 2 h). He thereby calculated the density of the Earth and\nfound d = 5.48 (current value 5.52). This density is greater than that of the rocks in the\nEarth\u2019s crust (? 2.7), and Cavendish thus demonstrated that the Earth contained a very\ndense central part. The method was later refined by Charles Boys (1895) using a very fine\nquartz thread (2 ?m) and still smaller masses (2.7 g, 7.5 kg at 15 cm), over a short period\n(3min). This type of experiment is still used to measure G, but the relative accuracy does\nnot exceed ?G/G = 1.2 \u00d7 10?4. Other ways are now sought to improve accuracy. Current\nrecommendations (CODATA 2010) give the value\n\nG = (6.67384 \u00b1 0.00080) \u00d7 10?11 m3 kg?1 s?2 .\n\n\n\n88 Chapter 3. Geopotential\n\nMethod Year ?

It has fixed axes and its time scale34\n\n33LAGEOS-1 (NASA), launched 4 May 1976, and LAGEOS-2 (NASA\u2013ASI, Italy),\nlaunched 22 October 1992, are almost identical satellites, of mass 410 kg and diameter\n60 cm, each carrying 426 circular reflectors (422 fused silica glass and 4 germanium). They\nare often referred to as LAGEOS and LAGEOS-II, respectively. Characteristics of similar\ngeodetic satellites: the Japanese satellite Ajisai, launched on 2 August 1986, mass 685 kg,\ndiameter 2.15m, 1,436 triangular fused silica reflectors; the Soviet satellites Etalon-1 and\n2, launched on 10 January 1989 and on 31 May 1989, identical, mass 1,415 kg, diameter\n1.29m, 2,146 hexagonal reflectors (2,140 fused silica, 6 germanium).\n\n34The International Time Bureau (Bureau International de l\u2019Heure, or BIH) was set up in\nParis at the beginning of the twentieth century (officially in 1912, but effectively in 1919) to\ncentralise time determinations made around the world and hence to define a universal time\nscale. It is associated with the Paris Observatory. For these historical reasons, the official\nacronyms of the various time scales used by astronomers and physicists maintain the order\nof the words in the French name, e.g., TAI, TCB, etc., with the sole exception of UT.\nIn 1988, the BIH founded the IERS (International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems\nService) to monitor the parameters of the Earth\u2019s rotation, while the organisation in charge\nof International Atomic Time (Temps Atomique International TAI) was transferred to the\n\n\n\n3.6 Appendix: Terrestrial Reference Systems 89\n\nis Barycentric Coordinated Time (Temps Coordonne?e Barycentrique TCB),\nwhich takes into account general relativistic effects.\n\nThe International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) is the realisation of\nthe ICRS. The frame is materialised by the positions of hundreds of extra-\ngalactic quasars (quasi-stellar radiosources), these being determined to very\nhigh accuracy, in fact better than 1 milli arcsec, using the VLBI technique\nexplained below.\n\n3.6.2 Terrestrial Reference System\n\nIn addition to the Earth\u2019s rotation, very slightly slowed down by the effect\nof the tides, two other motions need to be taken into account, due to the Sun\u2013\nMoon system. One is precession, the axis of rotation tracing out a cone with\nsemi-angle at the apex equal to the obliquity ?. This has a cycle of 25,800\nyears (see Fig. 6.7). The other is nutation, of amplitude 17??, for which the\nmain cycle is 18.6 years.\n\nAll these motions are very well understood and modelled, as can be seen\nfrom (8.49). But there is also an unpredictable movement of the polar axis (see\nFig. 7.6). To model this, one must adopt a reference system that represents\nthe Earth in its rotational movement. Since the Earth is a deformable solid,\nthe axes of the system can be fixed by convention with the help of materialised\npoints. Indeed, the surface is being continually deformed by the action of the\ntectonic plates, to the extent of a few centimetres a year, but also by seismic\nactivity.\n\nThe International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) has its origin at\nthe Earth\u2019s center of mass, including the oceans and the atmosphere. Its\norientation is specified by the IERS. It is conventional at the epoque 1984.0\nbut has since been guided by the condition of non-rotation of the Earth\u2019s\ncrust: the relative angular momentum of the Earth\u2019s surface, calculated with\npositions and velocities expressed in the terrestrial system, is thus zero. The\ntime scale is Geocentric Coordinated Time (Temps Coordonne?e Ge?ocentrique\nTCG).\n\nThe International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) is a realisation of\nthe ITRS. It is defined jointly by astronomers and geodesists. For this Carte-\nsian orthonormal system (O;x, y, z):\n\n\u2022 The origin O is chosen close to the Earth\u2019s center of mass, the value ob-\ntained by SLR and averaged over several years.\n\n\u2022 The coordinates are scaled by VLBI and SLR.\n\u2022 The orientation of the axes relative to the Earth\u2019s crust is fixed by con-\n\nvention. Its temporal variation is obtained by matching observed velocities\n\nInternational Bureau of Weights and Measures (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures\nBIPM).\n\n\n\n90 Chapter 3.

Collilieux.\n\nto those obtained using a geophysical model of the motion of the tectonic\nplates which does not involve any overall rotation.\n\nThe frame is materialised by hundreds of stations (ITRF2008: 934 stations in\n580 different sites). Their coordinates are determined by one or more of the\nfollowing techniques:\n\n\u2022 Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), since 1980.\n\u2022 Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR), since 1983.\n\u2022 Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite\n\n(DORIS), since 1993.\n\u2022 Static use of GPS, since 1994 (see Chap. 14).\n\nWe now outline each of these techniques, emphasising their relative impor-\ntance in space geodesy (see also Table 3.7). Several stations bring together\ntwo, three, or even four (at three stations) of these techniques, and thus con-\nstitute genuine anchor points for the reference systems.\n\nSatellite Laser Ranging (SLR)\n\nFrom a ground station,35 laser pulses are emitted to a satellite equipped\nwith reflectors (Fig. 3.8). A very small part of the emitted beam returns to the\n\n35At the present time, there are 43 stations, almost all in the northern hemisphere.\n\n\n\n3.6 Appendix: Terrestrial Reference Systems 91\n\ndetector at the ground station. The distance is then obtained to centimetre ac-\ncuracy by measuring the time taken for the signal to return. In the beginnings\nof space geodesy, only dedicated satellites, such as LAGEOS-1, were equipped\nwith reflectors (cube-corner mirrors). However, it was not long before a wide\nrange of other satellites were equipped with suitable reflectors.36\n\nThe same technique37 works with five reflectors set up on the Moon by\nthe three US missions Apollo-11, 14, and 15 and the two unmanned Soviet\nmissions Luna-17 and 21, and also with the LRO in orbit around the Moon.\n\nVery Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)\n\nVery long baseline interferometry is an astronomical technique developed\nsince 1980, although the first experiments date to 1967. The idea is to use two\nwidely separated antennas to measure the time difference between the arrival\nof the same signal (in the centimetre wavelength range) from a quasar. Today\nthere are around 40 VLBI stations on Earth. The resolution is proportional\nto the length of the baseline, i.e., the distance between the two antennas, so\nit is limited by the diameter of the Earth (of the order of a few thousand\nkilometres). However, the baseline can be made longer by using satellites in\nhigh orbits.\n\nEarth-based VLBI gives highly accurate results, reaching the milli arcsec\n(1 mas = 4.85\u00d7 10?9 rad), and a great many parameters can be fitted simul-\ntaneously. Given the positions of hundreds of extragalactic sources, one can\ndetermine the Earth\u2019s orientation in space, and hence also its rotation (UT1,\npolar motion, precession, nutation) viewed as a transformation between the\ncelestial frame ICRF and the terrestrial frame ITRF.\n\nDoppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by\nSatellite (DORIS)\n\nThe DORIS system was designed and developed by the French space\nagency, the CNES, in collaboration with the GRGS (Groupe de Recherches\nen Ge?ode?sie Spatiale) and the IGN (Institut Ge?ographique National). Small\nenergy-autonomous beacons are distributed uniformly around the planet, on\n\n36The main satellites are as follows. Satellites for geodesy: LAGEOS-1 and 2, LARES,\nGFO, GFZ-1, Stella, Starlette, Wespac-1, Etalon-1 and 2, Ajisai, CHAMP, GRACE-A and\nB, GOCE; the Japanese satellite H2A-LRE in geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). En-\nvironmental and oceanographic satellites: TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 and 2, ERS-1 and 2,\nEnvisat, TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X, ICESat, CryoSat-2, Meteor-2-21 (Fizeau), HY-2A.\nNavigation satellites: Navstar/GPS-35 and 36, the Japanese satellite QZS-1, practically\nall the Russian GLONASS satellites, the European satellites GIOVE-A and B and opera-\ntional Galileo satellites; from Compass-M1, the Chinese satellites in the Compass-M series,\nCompass-I and Compass-G. Astronomical satellites: RadioAstron on a very high orbit.\n\n37The ratio of the number of photons received to the number of photons emitted, called\nthe link budget, goes as r?4, where r is the distance. When the target is the Moon, this ratio\nis very small indeed, in fact, just a few photons over the whole night! Only two stations\nhave taken data over a long period: the McDonald Observatory in Texas and the OCA in\nGrasse, France.\n\n\n\n92 Chapter 3. Geopotential\n\nboth continents and oceans. These emit a signal which is received by satellites\nequipped for this purpose. The system is coordinated by a master beacon at\nthe CNES headquarters in Toulouse. The position of a satellite is determined\nto within a centimetre thanks to the network of stations used as reference\npoints on the ground. Conversely, the system can be used to accurately relate\ngiven points to the ITRF. A dozen or so satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO)\nare equipped with the DORIS system.38\n\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS)\n\nThe whole of Chap. 14 will be devoted to the satellite navigation system\n(GNSS), commonly known as GPS. In the appendix on GPS and tectonic\nplates (see Sect. 14.10), we explain how the positions of static GPS receiv-\ning stations can be ascertained with millimetre accuracy. These stations con-\ntribute to maintaining the ITRF.\n\n3.7 Appendix: Summary of Legendre Functions\n\nLegendre Polynomials\n\nThe generating function for the Legendre39 polynomials is\n\n1?\n1? 2tx+ t2\n\n=\n??\nn=0\n\nPn(x)t\nn .

He introduced the\npolynomials which are now named after him in his Recherches sur la figure des plane?tes\n(1784). When put in charge of geodetic measurements (the distance between the Paris\nand Greenwich meridians) by the revolutionary government known as the Convention, he\nmade significant contributions to spherical trigonometry. He obtained new results in number\ntheory, and also in the study of elliptic functions, the beta and gamma functions, and the\nEuler integrals.

Keplerian Motion\n\nAngular Momentum\n\nThe angular momentum per unit mass is defined by\n\nC = r ? r? . (4.4)\n\nDifferentiating with respect to time, we obtain\n\ndC\n\ndt\n= r? ? r? + r ? r? = r ? r? . (4.5)\n\nMoreover, using the definition and the relations (4.1) and (4.2), we obtain the\nexpression\n\nC = r2??k . (4.6)\n\n4.1.2 Properties of Central Acceleration\n\nConsider a material point S in space. Its motion is said to undergo central\nacceleration if there is some fixed point O such that, at each moment of time,\nthe vector OS and the acceleration vector are collinear. The motion of the\npoint has central acceleration if and only if\n\nr ? r? = 0 . (4.7)\n\nInserting this defining relation in (4.5), we obtain\n\ndC\n\ndt\n= 0 , (4.8)\n\nwhich shows that, for this type of motion, the angular momentum is constant\nin time:\n\nC = r ? r? = constant . (4.9)\n\nIf this constant is zero, the motion is in a straight line, since r and r? are\ncollinear.\n\nIf the constant vector on the right-hand side of (4.9) is not zero, and this\nis the general case that we shall consider hereafter, the motion of the point is\ncontained in the plane orthogonal to the constant vector. Let P denote this\nplane.\n\nThe quantity C calculated from (4.6) is thus constant:\n\nC = r2?? , with C = Ck . (4.10)\n\nNote that ?? cannot change sign during the motion.\n\n\n\n4.1 Central Acceleration 97\n\n4.1.3 Motion with Central Acceleration\n\nExpressing the Acceleration\n\nSetting\n\nr? = ?er , with ? = f(r) , (4.11)\n\nunder the assumption that the acceleration is central, it follows that ? is the\nsigned magnitude of this acceleration. Using the value for r? calculated in (4.3),\nwe obtain the following two relations, one for each component:\n\nr? ? r??2 = ? , (4.12)\n\n1\n\nr\n\nd\n\ndt\n(r2??) = 0 . (4.13)\n\nThe last relation shows once again that C is constant.\n\nAreal Law\n\nLet A be the (magnitude of the) area swept out by the vector r. The area\nelement is the area of the triangle with base rd? and height r. Hence, we have\ndA = (r/2)rd? and the areal speed (area swept out per unit time) is thus\n\ndA\ndt\n\n=\n1\n\n2\nr2?? =\n\n1\n\n2\nC . (4.14)\n\nThis is the areal law. It tells us that the area swept out is proportional to\nthe time. Alternatively, equal areas are swept out in equal times (see Figs. 4.1\nand 4.4).\n\nBinet\u2019s Equations\n\nBinet\u2019s equations give the velocity and acceleration as a function of the\nangle ? and the auxiliary variable u defined by\n\nu =\n1\n\nr\n. (4.15)\n\nTo find these relations, we eliminate the time t using (4.10), whence\n\n?? =\nC\n\nr2\n= Cu2 ,\n\nnoting further that\n\nr?? = Cu , r??2 = C2u3 .\n\n\n\n98 Chapter 4.

One refers to\nthe velocity via its magnitude V and the other refers to the acceleration via\nthe quantity ? :\n\nV 2 = C2\n\n[(\ndu\n\nd?\n\n)2\n+ u2\n\n]\n, (4.20)\n\n? = ?C2u2\n(\nd2u\n\nd?2\n+ u\n\n)\n. (4.21)\n\n4.2 Newtonian Acceleration\n\n4.2.1 Equation for the Trajectory\n\nA Newtonian acceleration is a central acceleration proportional to r?2.\nThe corresponding force is attractive.1 The expression for the acceleration\ngiven in (4.11) thus becomes\n\n? = ? ?\nr2\n\n. (4.22)\n\nWith the auxiliary variable u, we then have\n\n? = ??u2 . (4.23)\n\nThis reveals the usefulness of the Binet equation for the acceleration (4.21)\nin the case of a Newtonian acceleration: comparing with (4.23), a factor of u2\n\ncancels out. This leads to the equation\n\nd2u\n\nd?2\n+ u =\n\n?\n\nC2\n. (4.24)\n\nThis is a second order linear differential equation with constant coefficients\nand the right-hand side is constant. It is easy to solve. The general solution\nis the sum of the general solution of the homogeneous equation, i.e., with the\nright-hand side set to zero, which introduces two integration constants, and a\nparticular solution (just the right-hand side in this case):\n\nu = A cos(? ? ?0) +\n?\n\nC2\n, (4.25)\n\nwhere A and ?0 are the integration constants.\n\n1The term \u201cCoulombic\u201d is usually reserved for electrostatic phenomena, where forces\nmay be attractive or repulsive, while the word \u201cNewtonian\u201d refers to gravitational phenom-\nena, where the forces are always attractive.\n\n\n\n100 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nThe expression for r is\n\nr =\np\n\n1 + e cos(? ? ?0)\n, (4.26)\n\nwhere\n\np =\nC2\n\n?\n(4.27)\n\nand\n\ne = Ap . (4.28)\n\nThis is the equation for a conic section in polar coordinates with one focus at\nthe origin O, parameter p, and eccentricity e [see (1.16)]. The quantities e and\n?0 are determined by the initial conditions. In order to study the relationship\nbetween these quantities and the initial conditions, that is, to investigate the\nmain features of the trajectory, we use the Binet equation for the speed (4.20).\n\n4.2.2 Types of Trajectory\n\nEccentricity\n\nReturning to the variable u, we now write\n\nu =\n1 + e cos(? ? ?0)\n\np\n. (4.29)\n\nDifferentiating this relation,\n\ndu\n\nd?\n= ? e\n\np\nsin(? ? ?0) . (4.30)\n\nSubstituting into (4.20), we have\n\ne2 + 2e cos(? ? ?0) + 1 =\nV 2\n\nC2\np2 . (4.31)\n\nEquation (4.29) implies e cos(?? ?0) = up? 1, and since p = C2/?, we obtain\n\ne2 + 2\n\n(\nu\nC2\n\n?\n? 1\n)\n+ 1 =\n\nV 2C2\n\n?2\n.\n\nReturning to the variable r, the eccentricity is therefore given by\n\ne2 = 1 +\n2C2\n\n?2\n\n(\nV 2\n\n2\n? ?\n\nr\n\n)\n. (4.32)\n\n\n\n4.2 Newtonian Acceleration 101\n\nSince e, C, and ? are constants, this equation shows the constancy of the\nquantity K defined by\n\nK = 1\n2\nV 2 ? ?\n\nr\n= constant . (4.33)\n\nAt the end of the chapter, using the relation (4.111), we shall see that this\nquantity corresponds to the mechanical energy (per unit mass). For motion\nunder a Newtonian acceleration, r and V vary in such a way that the relation\n(4.33) is always satisfied.\n\nDifferent Cases\n\nWe shall now investigate the quantities r et e defined by (4.26) and (4.32)\n(see Fig. 4.12). Depending on the value of K, the eccentricity e can be greater\nthan or less than unity. We see that the quantity\n\nVe =\n\n?\n2\n?\n\nr\n(4.34)\n\nplays a specific role in this demarcation:\n\n\u2022 If K > 0, i.e., V > Ve, then e > 1. We have a hyperbola with focus at the\norigin O. This time we have the branch which is concave with respect to\nthe origin O, since the force is attractive.\n\n\u2022 If K = 0, i.e., V = Ve, then e = 1. We have a parabola with focus at O.\n\u2022 If K < 0, i.e., V < Ve, then e < 1. We now have an ellipse with one focus\n\nat O. In this case, there is a condition for the Eq. (4.32): the right-hand\nside cannot be negative. We must therefore have\n\nV 2 ? 2?\nr\n? ? ?\n\n2\n\nC2\n=? V 2 ? 2?\n\nr\n? ?\n\np\n,\n\nwhence the condition\n\nV ? Vs ,\n\nwhere\n\nVs =\n\n?\n2\n?\n\nr\n? ?\n\np\n. (4.35)\n\nThe quantity Vs is the orbital insertion speed for putting a satellite into\norbit at the distance r. We shall return to this case shortly. We shall also\nconsider the special case of an ellipse with zero eccentricity, which is in fact\na circle with center at O.\n\nIt is easy to understand the significance of the speed Ve defined above. When\nV ? Ve, the point S describing a parabola or a branch of a hyperbola can\ngo to infinity. On the other hand, when V < Ve, the point S remains forever\n\n\n\n102 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nwithin a finite distance of O and the motion is periodic. This speed, which\ndepends on r, is therefore known as the escape velocity at the distance r.\n\nIf the motion is to be periodic, the speed V must therefore satisfy the\nconditions\n\nVs ? V < Ve . (4.36)\n\nThe speed V of the body must be greater than Vs for it to be in orbit, but\nless than Ve for it to remain under the influence of the central gravitational\nattraction.2\n\nNote that the nature of the trajectory does not depend on the orientation\nof the velocity vector, but only on its magnitude V at a point at distance r\nfrom the origin.\n\n4.3 Trajectory and Period for Keplerian Motion\n\n4.3.1 Definition of Keplerian Motion\n\nKeplerian motion is the motion of a point mass in a central force field\ngoing as 1/r2, the center of the field being fixed. This field is a gravitational\nfield created by another mass, assumed motionless. We consider only these two\nmasses and make no attempt to include perturbations due to other bodies. In\nthe present chapter, we shall study the motion of this material point S and\nit will suffice to consider that it is subject to a Newtonian acceleration, or,\nin terms of forces, that it experiences a central force of the form 1/r2 in a\nGalilean frame.\n\nSince the aim here is to study satellite trajectories, we shall hereafter\nconsider only periodic trajectories, that is, elliptical trajectories with K < 0\nor e < 1, unless otherwise specified.\n\n4.3.2 Periodic Trajectories\n\nElliptical Trajectories\n\nIn the case of an elliptical trajectory, given the eccentricity in (4.32), we\ncan write\n\n1? e2 = ?2C\n2\n\n?2\nK , with K < 0 .\n\n2At the beginning of the space age, one finds the terms \u201cfirst cosmic velocity\u201d, \u201csecond\ncosmic velocity\u201d, and so on, particular in the Soviet scientific literature. The third cosmic\nvelocity is the one required to escape from the sphere of influence of the Solar System.\n\n\n\n4.3 Trajectory and Period for Keplerian Motion 103\n\nWe also know that an ellipse is defined by its semi-major axis a and its ec-\ncentricity e. The parameter p is defined by p = a(1 ? e2). Hence, by (4.27),\nwe have\n\n1? e2 = p\na\n=\n\nC2\n\n?a\n. (4.37)\n\nThese relations imply\n\n2K = V 2 ? 2?\nr\n\n= ??\na\n. (4.38)\n\nWe may now deduce the expression for the speed V as a function of r :\n\nV 2 = ?\n\n(\n2\n\nr\n? 1\n\na\n\n)\n. (4.39)\n\nWe can check that the right-hand side is always positive since, in an ellipse,\nr is always less than 2a.\n\nTo sum up, the equation for the elliptical trajectory can be written in\npolar coordinates in the form\n\nr = r(?) =\nC2\n\n?\n\n1\n\n1 + e cos(? ? ?0)\n, (4.40)\n\nwhere\n\ne2 = 1? C\n2\n\n?a\n, (4.41)\n\nor alternatively,\n\nr = r(?) =\na(1? e2)\n\n1 + e cos(? ? ?0)\n. (4.42)\n\nDuring the periodic motion of the point S, the distance r goes through a\nminimum and a maximum, denoted respectively by rp and ra\n\n3:\n\nrp = r(? = ?0) = a(1? e) ,\nra = r(? = ?0 + ?) = a(1 + e) .\n\n(4.43)\n\n3The subscripts p and a stand for the perigee and the apogee, respectively, for motion\naround the Earth (? ? ??  ?\t), or perihelion and aphelion, for motion around the Sun (?\n'\n??\t? ??). More generally, when the gravitational source is not specified, we speak of the\nperiastron and apoastron, or pericenter and apocenter. The prefixes \u201cperi\u201d and \u201capo\u201d come\nfrom the adverbs ???? and (?) meaning \u201cabove\u201d and \u201cfar away\u201d, respectively. The names\nperihelion and aphelion were invented by Kepler (1596) as an extension of the terms perigee\nand apogee used by Ptolemy.\n\n\n\n104 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nThe sum of these two lengths is obviously equal to the major axis of the\nellipse, i.e., rp + ra = 2a. The eccentricity can be expressed in the form\n\ne =\nra ? rp\nra + rp\n\n=\nra\na\n\n? 1 = 1? rp\na\n\n. (4.44)\n\nReferring to (4.39), we see that the speed V goes through a maximum Vp for\nr = rp and a minimum Va for r = ra, with respective values\n\nVp =\n\n?\n?\n\na\n\n?\n1 + e\n\n1? e =\n?\n\n?\n\np\n(1 + e) , (4.45)\n\nVa =\n\n?\n?\n\na\n\n?\n1? e\n1 + e\n\n=\n\n?\n?\n\np\n(1 ? e) . (4.46)\n\nWe thus deduce the following relations between the speeds at the apsides4:\n\nrpVp = raVa =\n\n?\n?\n\np\na(1? e2) = ??p = C .\n\nWe retrieve the angular momentum C, since, for these two extremal points\non the ellipse, the velocity and the radial vector are orthogonal.\n\nNote also that\n\nVp\nVa\n\n=\nra\nrp\n\n=\n1 + e\n\n1? e . (4.47)\n\nUsing the eccentricity angle \n defined by (1.27), the apsidal velocities can be\nwritten\n\nVp =\n\n?\n?\n\na\ntan\n(?\n4\n+\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n)\n, Va =\n\n?\n?\n\na\ntan\n(?\n4\n? \n\n\n2\n\n)\n. (4.48)\n\nThe speed can be expressed in terms of the polar angle. From (4.31), we find\n\nV 2 =\n?\n\np\n\n[\n1 + 2e cos(? ? ?0) + e2\n\n]\n=\n\n?\n\na\n\n1 + 2e cos(? ? ?0) + e2\n1? e2 . (4.49)\n\nExample 4.1 Calculate the eccentricity of the orbit of an artificial Earth satel-\nlite with altitude 500 km at perigee and 40,000 km at apogee (Molniya orbit).\nTake R = 6,400 km.\n\n4The apsidal line is the line joining the perigee and the apogee. This line segment is\nthe major axis of the ellipse. The perigee and apogee are the two apsides, also called the\ninferior apsis and superior apsis, respectively. This word comes from the Greek ? *??\t? ??#?\t,\nmeaning \u201cvault\u201d or \u201ccelestial vault\u201d, having lost the initial aspiration. The architectural\nterm \u201capse\u201d, which refers to the semicircular recess covered with a hemispherical vault,\nusually at the east end of a church, has the same origin.\n\n\n\n4.3 Trajectory and Period for Keplerian Motion 105\n\n? If hp and ha are the altitudes at perigee and apogee, then using the distances\nrp and ra defined by (4.43), we have\n\nrp = R+ hp , ra = R+ ha , a = R+\nha + hp\n\n2\n.\n\nWith (4.44), we obtain the eccentricity\n\ne =\nha ? hp\n\n2R+ ha + hp\n. (4.50)\n\nIn the case of the Molniya orbit, we have\n\ne =\n39,500\n\n12,800 + 40,500\n? 0.75 .\n\nMoreover, (4.47) gives\n\nVa\nVp\n\n=\n1? e\n1 + e\n\n= 0.25/1.75 = 1/7 .\n\nWith this type of orbit, the satellite is moving seven times slower at apogee\nthan at perigee. ?\n\nSpecial Case of Circular Trajectory\n\nA circle is an ellipse with eccentricity e = 0. Equation (4.41) gives\n\nC2\n\n?\n= a .\n\nSubstituting in (4.26), we obtain the expected relation for a circle, viz.,\n\nr =\nC2\n\n?\n= a = p .\n\nThe speeds Ve and Vs defined by (4.34) and (4.35) become in this case\n\nVe =\n\n?\n2\n?\n\na\n, Vs =\n\n?\n?\n\na\n=\n\nVe?\n2\n. (4.51)\n\nMoreover, the relation involving the constant K gives\n\n2K = V 2 ? 2?\na\n\n= ??\na\n,\n\nwhence\n\nV =\n\n?\n?\n\na\n=\n\nC\n\na\n. (4.52)\n\n\n\n106 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nThis shows that the magnitude V of the velocity is constant and equal to Vs.\nCircular motion is uniform.\n\nConsidering the value of ? given by (4.22), it can also be checked that\nwe do retrieve the usual value for the acceleration in the case of a uniform\ncircular motion:\n\n? = ? ?\na2\n\n= ?V\n2\n\na\n.\n\n4.3.3 Period and Mean Motion\n\nPeriod\n\nThe period is the time T taken by the point S to describe the whole ellipse.\nIntegrating (4.14) over one period, we obtain\n\nA = 1\n2\nCT .\n\nIn this case, A represents the area of the ellipse, i.e., A = ?ab, where b is the\nsemi-minor axis of the ellipse. Recall further that b2 = pa. Hence,\n\nA = ?a?pa = ?C\n\n?\na3\n\n?\n.\n\nThe period is therefore\n\nT = 2?\n\n?\na3\n\n?\n. (4.53)\n\nThis is called the period of revolution,5 orbital period, or Keplerian period\nof the motion.6 Note that, for an attractive body ?, the Keplerian period\ndepends only on the semi-major axis a and not on the eccentricity e.\n\n5The word \u201crevolution\u201d comes from low Latin revolutio, onis, meaning \u201cunfolding\u201d or\n\u201creturn\u201d, from the Latin verb volvere, meaning \u201croll\u201d, with the prefix re-. Since the Middle\nAges, it has come to mean the periodic return of a heavenly body to its point of departure.\nCopernicus used it in the title of his celebrated treatise. The transition to its present use,\nto refer to a radical or significant change of political, economic, or cultural regime, as\nexemplified by the French Revolution, came only much later. The scientific meaning thus\npredates the everyday use of the term. So when we see references to the \u201cCopernican\nrevolution\u201d, e.g., Kant in 1787, we may say that we have come full circle.\n\n6As we shall see later, when Keplerian motion is perturbed, we can define several periods\nrelating to the actual motion, such as the nodal (or draconitic) period and the anomalistic\nperiod.\n\n\n\n4.4 Time as a Function of Position: The Three Anomalies 107\n\nMean Motion\n\nThe corresponding angular speed n, called the mean motion, is defined as\n\nn =\n2?\n\nT\n=\n\n?\n?\n\na3\n. (4.54)\n\nThe mean motion is the angular speed (SI unit rad s?1, radian per second)\nof a fictitious point in uniform circular motion at radius a and with the same\nperiod as a point in Keplerian motion on an orbit with semi-major axis a. With\n(4.53), the constant C in (4.14) can be expressed very simply as a function of\nn and the dimensions of the ellipse:\n\nC = nab . (4.55)\n\n4.3.4 Relation Between Position and Time\n\nThe relations established above give us the trajectory in polar coordinates,\ni.e., the relation between r and ?. They were obtained without reference to\nthe time, since we started out from Binet\u2019s equations, which were themselves\nestablished by eliminating the time. In order to find an expression for the time\nt in terms of the polar coordinates, i.e., to determine the position of the point\nS at any time, we must go back to the constant in the areal law for motion\nwith a central acceleration, as specified in (4.10). To obtain t, we integrate\nthis relation:\n\ndt =\n1\n\nC\nr2d? . (4.56)\n\nBy this integration, we obtain the time t as a function of the position of the\npoint, as specified by r or ?.\n\nFrom a purely practical point of view, we usually require the inverse func-\ntional relation, i.e., the position as a function of the time t. There is no direct\nanalytic solution and we must apply a special treatment. This is Kepler\u2019s\nproblem. Here we discuss these points as follows:\n\n\u2022 Determination of the time as a function of position in Sect. 4.4.\n\u2022 Determination of the position as a function of time in Sect. 4.5.\n\n4.4 Time as a Function of Position: The Three\n\nAnomalies\n\nThe time t is obtained using (4.56) and integrating r2d?. We consider two\nmethods:\n\n\n\n108 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\n\u2022 In the first method, we eliminate r, expressing it as a function of ?, i.e.,\nr = f(?). We then obtain t from\n\nt =\n1\n\nC\n\n? [\nf(?)\n]2\nd? .\n\n\u2022 In the second approach, we eliminate ?, first expressing d? in the form\nd? = g(r)dr, and then obtaining t from\n\nt =\n1\n\nC\n\n?\nr2g(r)dr .\n\nWe shall also see how this last result can be obtained by a method based on\nthe geometric properties of the ellipse.\n\n4.4.1 Expression for the Time and the Mean Anomaly M\n\nIn order to introduce the angles known as anomalies in a homogeneous\nway in the following,7 we transform the time into an angle for any periodic\ntrajectory with mean motion n. The required angle M varies linearly with\ntime from M = 0 for t = tp, when the body is at perigee, to M = 2? for\nt = tp + T , when the body next returns to perigee. The definition of this\nangle, called the mean anomaly, is therefore\n\nM = n(t? tp) . (4.57)\n\n4.4.2 Expression t = t(?) and the True Anomaly v\n\nThe starting point is (4.56), in which we replace r by its expression as a\nfunction of ?, as given by (4.40):\n\ndt =\n1\n\nC\n\np2[\n1 + e cos(? ? ?0)\n\n]2 d? .\n\n7Kepler invented the term for these angles, from anomalia, \u00e6 in Latin. It originally\ncomes from the Greek word ? (????\n??? ?\t, which means \u201cirregularity\u201d (privative prefix\n(? and adjective ???\n)\t, meaning \u201cself-similar\u201d or \u201cregular\u201d). The idea behind this was to\nexpress the irregular behaviour of this angle in time (since the motion does not appear to be\ncircular or regular). Kepler first used the term to indicate the position of Mars with respect\nto the Sun and he defined several anomalies. Among these were the three described in\nthis chapter: the true anomaly (anomalia co\u00e6quata vera), the eccentric anomaly (anomalia\neccentri), and the mean anomaly (anomalia media). In his work Astronomia Nova, apart\nfrom the true anomaly, Kepler used the \u201cartificial\u201d anomaly (anomalia co\u00e6quata fictitia)\nand four other anomalies (anomalia circularis & elliptica, anomalia distantaria, anomalia\nscrupularia).\n\n\n\n4.4 Time as a Function of Position: The Three Anomalies 109\n\nThe minimal value of r, namely r = rp, is obtained for ? = ?0 [see (4.43)], and\nit is convenient to measure angles from this origin. We thus make the change\nof variable\n\nv = ? ? ?0 . (4.58)\n\nThe angle v is called the true anomaly. We then calculate t = t(v) from\n\nt =\np2\n\nC\n\n?\ndv\n\n(1 + e cos v)2\n.\n\nThis type of function integrates as follows:\n\nI =\n?\n\ndv\n\n(1 + e cos v)\n2 = ?\n\ne sin v\n\n(1? e2)(1 + e cos v) +\n1\n\n(1? e2)\n\n?\ndv\n\n1 + e cos v\n,\n\n?\ndv\n\n1 + e cos v\n=\n\n2?\n1? e2\n\narctan\n\n(?\n1? e\n1 + e\n\ntan\nv\n\n2\n\n)\n.\n\nUsing (4.37), we have\n\np2\n\nC\n=\n\n?\na3\n\n?\n(1 ? e2)3/2 = (1? e\n\n2)3/2\n\nn\n,\n\nwith the expression for the mean motion n given by (4.54).\nTaking the time origin as t = tp for r = rp and v = 0, we now obtain\n\nt? tp =\n(1? e2)3/2\n\nn\nI ,\n\nwhich gives the time as a function of ? via\n\nn(t? tp) = M = 2 arctan\n(?\n\n1? e\n1 + e\n\ntan\nv\n\n2\n\n)\n? e\n\n?\n1? e2 sin v\n1 + e cos v\n\n. (4.59)\n\nWe have thus expressed t as a function of the polar angle ? or, which comes\nto the same, M as a function of v.\n\nFrom this, we can write (4.42) in the form\n\nr = r(v) =\na(1 ? e2)\n1 + e cos v\n\n, (4.60)\n\nwhich gives the distance r as a function of the true anomaly.\nFor the speed, the expression (4.49) becomes\n\nV 2 =\n?\n\na\n\n1 + 2e cos v + e2\n\n1? e2 . (4.61)\n\n\n\n110 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\n4.4.3 Expression t = t(r) and the Eccentric Anomaly E\n\nAnalytic Method for Obtaining Kepler\u2019s Equation\n\nInstead of expressing d? directly as a function of r, we adopt a neighbouring\napproach, starting from (4.32). This relates V and r to the parameters of the\nellipse and allows us to write\n\nV 2 =\n2?\n\nr\n? ?\n\n2\n\nC2\n(1? e2) .\n\nFrom the vector form (4.2) for the velocity, we have\n\nV 2 = r?2 + r2??2 = r?2 +\nC2\n\nr2\n,\n\nwhere ? has been eliminated using the areal law (4.14). This leads to\n\nr?2 =\n\n(\ndr\n\ndt\n\n)2\n= ? ?\n\n2\n\nC2\n(1? e2) + 2?\n\nr\n? C\n\n2\n\nr2\n,\n\nand the differential equation\n\ndt =\nr dr?\n\n??2(1? e2)r2/C2 + 2?r ? C2\n.\n\nReplacing C2 by ?a(1 ? e2), we obtain the following simplifications:\n\n? ?\n2\n\nC2\n(1 ? e2)r2 + 2?r ? C2 = ??\n\na\nr2 + 2?r ? ?a(1? e2)\n\n=\n?\n\na\n(?r2 + 2ar ? a2 + a2e2)\n\n=\n?\n\na\n\n[\na2e2 ? (r ? a)2\n\n]\n,\n\nwhereupon\n\ndt =\n\n?\na\n\n?\n\nr dr?\na2e2 ? (r ? a)2\n\n. (4.62)\n\nTo integrate this equation, it is convenient to introduce the auxiliary angle\nvariable E such that a? r = ae cosE, which can also be defined by\n\ncosE =\n1\n\ne\n\n(\n1? r\n\na\n\n)\n. (4.63)\n\nThis angle is called the eccentric anomaly.8 It is illustrated in Fig. 4.1. Below\nwe describe its geometric meaning in relation to the ellipse. Note that E = 0\nfor r = rp and E = ? for r = ra [see (4.43)].\n\n8Eccentric means off-center. The center in question is not the center of the circle or the\nellipse, but the focus of the ellipse, which is the center of attraction. In Chap. 1, this angle\nappears in the relation (1.29).\n\n\n\n4.4 Time as a Function of Position: The Three Anomalies 111\n\nWe now make the change of variable\n\nr = a(1 ? e cosE) , (4.64)\nso that dr = ae sinE dE. As a function of E, (4.62) becomes\n\ndt =\n\n?\na\n\n?\na(1? e cosE) dE .\n\nThe integration is carried out taking the time origin at t = tp for r = rp and\nE = 0:\n\nt? tp =\n\n?\na3\n\n?\n(E ? e sinE) .\n\nBringing in the mean motion n, we obtain\n\nn(t? tp) = M = E ? e sinE . (4.65)\nThis is known as Kepler\u2019s equation. We have thus expressed t as a function\nof r, or equivalently, M as a function of E.\n\nGeometric Method for Obtaining Kepler\u2019s Equation\n\nWe use the areal law and the fact that the ellipse is an affine transformation\nof the principal circle with expansion\n\n?\n1? e2, axis Ox, and direction Oy.\n\nIntegrating the areal law (4.14) from tp to t, we obtain\n\nt? tp =\n2\n\nC\nA ,\n\nwhere the quantity A is the area swept out between these two times, i.e., in\nthe notation of Fig. 4.1, the area of the curvilinear triangle OPS. Let A? be\nthe area of the curvilinear triangle OPT , where T is the point giving S under\nthe affine transformation. We thus have\n\nA =\n?\n1? e2A? .\n\nReplacing C by\n?\n?a(1? e2), we now have\n\nt? tp =\n2\n\n?\n?a\n\nA? .\n\nThe area A? is calculated to be\nA? = sector CPT ? triangle COT\n\n= sector {angle E} ? 1\n2\nCO \u00d7HT\n\n=\n1\n\n2\na2E ? 1\n\n2\n(ae)\u00d7 (a sinE) = 1\n\n2\na2(E ? e sinE) .\n\nThis geometrical method yields Kepler\u2019s equation very quickly, with the ex-\npression for A? and introducing the mean motion:\n\nn(t? tp) = M = E ? e sinE . (4.66)\n\n\n\n112 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nExpressions Involving the Anomaly E\n\nThe eccentric anomalyE has no counterpart in physical reality. It is merely\na mathematical tool that proves useful in calculations and often leads to simple\nexpressions. For example, a few manipulations yield\n\nr? =\n\n?\n?a\n\nr\ne sinE , (4.67)\n\nr\u00b7r? = rr? = ??ae sinE , (4.68)\nand\n\nV 2 =\n?\n\na\n\n1 + e cosE\n\n1? e cosE . (4.69)\n\n4.4.4 Relating the Anomalies\n\nRelation Between the Anomalies v and E\n\nTo establish the relations between v and E (see Fig. 4.1), the ellipse is\nequipped with a frame (Ox,Oy). Let O be the principal focus, the center of\nthe Newtonian field, and C the center of the ellipse. The major axis is AP ,\nwhere P (perigee) is the point on the ellipse closest to O and A (apogee) the\npoint furthest away. We choose the Ox axis along OP and the Oy axis at 90?\n\nto it in the anticlockwise direction. Let R be the intersection of Oy with the\nellipse, and Q the intersection of the line parallel to Oy through C with the\nellipse. We then have the following correspondence:\n\na = CP , b = CQ , p = OR , ae = CO , rp = OP , ra = OA .\n\nWe also draw the circle with center C and radius CP which contains the\nellipse and is tangent to it at P and A. This is the principal circle. Let S be\nan arbitrary point on the ellipse and H its projection onto Ox.\n\nThe true anomaly can be defined immediately as the polar angle\n\nv = (Ox,OS) .\n\nThe eccentric anomaly is obtained geometrically from its definition as\n\nE = (Cx,CT ) ,\n\nwhere the point T is the intersection of the straight line HS with the principal\ncircle. Indeed, according to the relation (4.63), we have cosE = (a ? r)/ae.\nTransforming (a? r) in such a way as to bring in v, i.e.,\n\na? r = a(1? e2)? r + ae2 = r(1 + e cos v)? r + ae2 = e(r cos v + ae) ,\n\n\n\n4.4 Time as a Function of Position: The Three Anomalies 113\n\nwe find\n\ncosE =\nr cos v + ae\n\na\n=\n\nCH\n\nCT\n,\n\nusing the notation from Fig. 4.1. The angle E is indeed the angle C of the\nright-angled triangle HCT .\n\nTo obtain the relation between the angles v and E, we write down the\ncoordinates of the point S, viz.,\n\nx = r cos v = a(cosE ? e) , (4.70)\ny = r sin v = a\n\n?\n1? e2 sinE , (4.71)\n\nwhence\n\n?\nx2 + y2 = r = a(1? e cosE) ,\n\nand deduce the relations between the true and eccentric anomalies. Note that\nv and E change sign together.\n\nFor v as a function of E,\n\ncos v =\ncosE ? e\n1? e cosE , sin v =\n\n?\n1? e2 sinE\n1? e cosE ,\n\nWe calculate the quantities (1 + cos v) and (1? cos v), viz.,\n\n1 + cos v =\n(1? e)(1 + cosE)\n\n1? e cosE =? cos\n2 v\n\n2\n=\n\n1? e\n1? e cosE cos\n\n2 E\n\n2\n,\n\n1? cos v = (1 + e)(1 ? cosE)\n1? e cosE =? sin\n\n2 v\n\n2\n=\n\n1 + e\n\n1? e cosE sin\n2 E\n\n2\n,\n\nto arrive at the relation\n\ntan\nv\n\n2\n=\n\n?\n1 + e\n\n1? e tan\nE\n\n2\n. (4.72)\n\nFor E as a function of v,\n\ncosE =\ncos v + e\n\n1 + e cos v\n, sinE =\n\n?\n1? e2 sin v\n1 + e cos v\n\n,\n\ntan\nE\n\n2\n=\n\n?\n1? e\n1 + e\n\ntan\nv\n\n2\n. (4.73)\n\n\n\n114 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nWe can also express the difference (v ? E) as a function of v or E :\n\ntan\nv ? E\n\n2\n=\n\n? sinE\n\n1? ? cosE =\n? sin v\n\n1 + ? cos v\n, (4.74)\n\nwhere\n\n? =\ne\n\n1 +\n?\n1? e2\n\n=\n1?\n\n?\n1? e2\ne\n\n. (4.75)\n\nWith the eccentricity angle \n defined by (1.27), we have\n\n? = tan\n\n\n\n2\n, (4.76)\n\ntan\nv\n\n2\n= tan\n\n(?\n4\n+\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n)\ntan\n\nE\n\n2\n, tan\n\nE\n\n2\n= tan\n\n(?\n4\n? \n\n\n2\n\n)\ntan\n\nv\n\n2\n.\n\nDifferential Relations Between the Anomalies\n\nFrom the definition of M , we have\n\ndM\n\ndt\n= n . (4.77)\n\nEquation (4.65) yields\n\nn =\ndM\n\ndt\n= (1? e cosE)dE\n\ndt\n(4.78)\n\nand\n\ndE\n\ndM\n=\n\n1\n\n1? e cosE . (4.79)\n\nThe relation between dM and dv is deduced from the areal law. Equa-\ntion (4.14) gives\n\nd?\n\ndt\n=\n\nC\n\nr2\n=\n\nna2\n?\n1? e2\nr2\n\n,\n\nand since d? and dv are equivalent, we have\n\nn =\ndM\n\ndt\n=\n\nr2\n\na2\n?\n1? e2\n\ndv\n\ndt\n, (4.80)\n\nand hence,\n\ndv\n\ndM\n=\n\na2\n\nr2\n\n?\n1? e2 . (4.81)\n\nUsing (4.64), (4.79), and (4.81), we have the following three useful relations:\n\ndE\n\ndM\n=\n\na\n\nr\n,\n\ndv\n\ndM\n=\n\nab\n\nr2\n,\n\ndv\n\ndE\n=\n\nb\n\nr\n.

The converse problem consists in expressing the true\nanomaly in terms of time. This is called Kepler\u2019s problem. It has no analytical\nsolution.\n\nAt a given time t, defining the value M = M(t) of the mean anomaly,\nKepler\u2019s equation becomes\n\nE ? e sinE = M . (4.83)\n\nWe wish to obtain E as a function ofM , so that we may subsequently obtain v.\nSince Kepler\u2019s time, dozens of methods9 have been put forward to solve\n\nthis transcendental equation in E. We shall present the following:\n\n\u2022 An iterative numerical method.\n\u2022 An overview of methods using series expansions and an approximate for-\n\nmula for small eccentricities.\n\nWe shall focus mainly on the first method, which is currently the most widely\nused. It can yield any required accuracy, and with today\u2019s computers these\notherwise tedious calculations now take only a fraction of a microsecond.\n\n4.5.2 Solution by Numerical Iteration\n\nNewton\u2013Raphson Method\n\nThe idea of the Newton\u2013Raphson method, used here to solve Kepler\u2019s\nproblem, is to approximate a curve near a point by its tangent at that point\n(first order Taylor expansion) and then to proceed by iteration. The equation\nof the curve is first transformed into the form f(x) = 0. We check that there\nis a solution and that it is unique.\n\nWe draw the tangent at a point An on the curve which has coordinates(\nx = xn, y = f(xn)\n\n)\n(see Fig. 4.2). It cuts the x axis at a point Bn with\n\n9In January 1900, the Bulletin Astronomique of the Paris Observatory provided a bib-\nliography of 123 papers dealing with the solution of Kepler\u2019s problem, either analytically\nor graphically. Some of the great names of astronomy and mathematics appear on the list,\nincluding Kepler (1609), Newton (1687), Cassini (1719), Simpson (1740), Euler (1747), La-\nlande (Astronomie, 1764), Lagrange (Sur le proble?me de Kepler, 1769), Gauss (Theoria\nmotus, 1809), Littrow (Anomali\u00e6 ver\u00e6 per mediam determinatio, 1814), Delambre (1817),\nBessel (U?ber das Keplersche Problem, 1818), Laplace (Me?moire sur le de?veloppement de\nl\u2019anomalie vraie, 1823), Wallace (Two elementary solutions of Kepler\u2019s problem, 1835),\nEncke (Auflo?sung des Keplerschen Gleichung, 1850), Cauchy (1854), Lehmann (Ueber eine\ndefinitive Lo?sung des Keplerschen Problems, 1855, followed by many other purportedly\ndefinitive publications over several years), Le Verrier (1855), and Radau (1882).\n\n\n\n116 Chapter 4.

From Bn, we find the point on the curve with\nthe same abscissa as Bn, denoted by An+1 =\n\n(\nx = xn+1, y = f(xn+1)\n\n)\n, and\n\nthen repeat the process until we obtain convergence.\nThe gradient of the straight line joining the points An and Bn is\n\nf ?(xn) =\nyn ? 0\n\nxn ? xn+1\n,\n\nwhence\n\nxn+1 = xn ?\nf(xn)\n\nf ?(xn)\n. (4.84)\n\nIterative Solution\n\nConsider Kepler\u2019s equation, written in the form\n\nf(E) = E ? e sinE ?M ,\n\nwith E playing the role of x. The solution will be such that f(E) = 0. The\nderivative of f with respect to E is\n\nf ?(E) = 1? e cosE .\n\nNote that, if M is equal to 0 or ?, the solution is E = M . We first check that\nthere is a solution and that it is unique. We thus consider E and M in the\nopen interval (0, ?) and we see that f(0) = ?M and f(?) = ? ? M . There\nis therefore at least one solution, since for this continuous function, we have\nf(0) < 0 and f(?) > 0. As the derivative is always positive, f ?(E) > 0 with\ne < 1, the function is strictly increasing and the solution is thus unique. We\ncan apply the same argument in the interval (??, 0).\n\n\n\n4.5 Position as a Function of Time: Kepler\u2019s Problem 117\n\nWe therefore apply the iteration formula\n\nEn+1 = En ?\nEn ? e sinEn ?M\n\n1? e cosEn\n. (4.85)\n\nWe begin with an initial value E0, to be defined. When we consider that the\nsolution has been obtained to within the required accuracy, we set E = En+1.\nWith the resulting solution E, we obtain v by (4.72), i.e.,\n\nv = 2 arctan\n\n(?\n1 + e\n\n1? e tan\nE\n\n2\n\n)\n. (4.86)\n\nConvergence of the Iteration\n\nThe rate of convergence, i.e., the number N of iterations needed to obtain\nthe result, depends on e, M , and the chosen initial value E0. It also depends\non the required accuracy, which we denote by Qk, meaning that the selected\nangle is known with an error of less than 10?k degrees, or put another way,\nfor E expressed in degrees, the first k decimal places are exact.\n\nThe number N can be expressed as a function, viz.,\n\nN = N(e,M ;E0,Qk) .\n\nThe rate of convergence is no longer an issue today, due to the high speed of\ncomputer calculations. But in homage to the astronomers who, over four cen-\nturies, carried out calculations of this kind, we shall give here some indications\nof what is involved.\n\nClassically, we set\n\nE0 = M ,\n\nto start the iteration. In this case, convergence is rather fast, unless e > 0.9\nwhen the values of the mean anomaly are small, i.e., |M | < 20?. The rate of\nconvergence can be significantly increased by starting with\n\nE0 =\n\n{\nM + e if M ? 0 ,\nM ? e if M ? 0 ,\n\nwhich we may write as\n\nE0 = M + e \u00d7 ?(M) ,\n\nwhere ?(M) represents the function signM , equal to +1 for M > 0 and ?1\nfor M < 0. The angles E and M are given in radians and take values in the\ninterval (??,+?).\n\nFigure 4.3 illustrates these two cases, plotting\n\nN = N(e,M ;E0 = M,Q6) , N = N(e,M ;E0 = M + e\u00d7 ?(M),Q6) .\n\n\n\n118 Chapter 4.

This satellite has a Molniya orbit. For the mean anomaly, 1 h corresponds to\n360/T = 360/12 = 30?. We thus solve Kepler\u2019s problem in detail for M = 30?.\nThe angles are converted into radians in the interval (??,+?). We use (4.85).\nThe iteration begins with E0 = M = ?/6. We then calculate E1 :\n\nE1 =\n?\n\n6\n? ?/6? 0.74 sin(?/6)? ?/6\n\n1? 0.74 cos(?/6) = 1.55383 ,\n\nand likewise E2, E3, and so on:\n\nE2 = 1.55383?\n1.55383? 0.74 sin(1.55383)? ?/6\n\n1? 0.74 cos(1.55383) = 1.25980 ,\n\nE3 = 1.25980?\n1.25980? 0.74 sin(1.25980)? ?/6\n\n1? 0.74 cos(1.25980) = 1.21882 ,\n\nE4 = 1.21882?\n1.21882? 0.74 sin(1.21882)? ?/6\n\n1? 0.74 cos(1.21882) = 1.21803 ,\n\nE5 = 1.21803?\n1.21803? 0.74 sin(1.21803)? ?/6\n\n1? 0.74 cos(1.21803) = 1.21803 .\n\nWe consider the result to be obtained after five iterations, given the desired\naccuracy, which is Q4 here. Hence,\n\nE = 1.21803 .\n\nAltering the first estimate, we can start the iteration with\n\nE0 = M + e = ?/6 + 0.74 = 1.26360 .\n\nWe then calculate\n\nE1 = 1.2180197 , E2 = 1.21803 , E3 = 1.21803 .\n\nThe convergence is faster.\nHaving determined the eccentric anomaly to have the value E = 1.21803\n\nrad = 69.7880?, we obtain v using (4.86):\n\nv = 2 arctan\n\n(?\n1.74\n\n0.26\ntan\n\n69.7880\n\n2\n\n)\n= 122.0062? .\n\n\n\n120 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nFigure 4.4 (upper) shows the values of v in degrees as obtained by interaction\non E, for the required values of M . By the symmetry of the Kepler problem,\nit is not necessary to calculate the angles M in the range from ?180? to 0?.\nWe merely replace M by ?M and, in the results, replace E and v likewise by\n?E and ?v. To determine the distance r, we first calculate the semi-major\naxis using (4.53), whence a = 26,609 km. We calculate r = r(v) using (4.60)\nand the results are shown in Fig. 4.4 (upper). Clearly, r(?v) = r(v) (angles in\ndegrees).\n\nNote also that, if we wish to know when the satellite has reached a given\nvalue of the true anomaly, e.g., 90?, we obtain the result directly, without\nsolving Kepler\u2019s problem, by using (4.59) and setting v = ?/2 rad:\n\nM = 2 arctan\n\n?\n0.76\n\n1.74\n? 0.74\n\n?\n1? 0.742 = 0.73773? 0.49773 ,\n\nwhich gives M = 0.23000 rad = 13.751? equivalent to 13.751/30 h = 28min.\nThe value of r at this time corresponds to the parameter p. In this case,\n\nr = r(v = ?/2) = a(1? e2) = p = 12,037 km .\n\nReferring to Fig. 4.1, the satellite S takes 28min to go from the point P , the\nperigee (v = 0?), to the point R with true anomaly v = 90?, and it takes 5 h\n32min to go from R to the apogee A (v = 180?).\n\nNote. Here we have been considering a Molniya-type satellite, with a period\nof half a mean solar day (720min). In reality, the period of such a satellite is\nhalf a sidereal day (718min).\n\nFigure 4.4 (lower) illustrates the results from this example. ?\n\n4.5.3 Other Methods of Solution\n\nHere we outline the underlying idea of methods which transform the quan-\ntity E ?

Keplerian Motion\n\nExpansion in Powers of the Eccentricity\n\nStarting with E ?M = e sinE, Lagrange wrote E ?M in the form of a\npower series in the eccentricity:\n\nE ?M =\n??\nk=1\n\nek\n\nk!\n\ndk?1 sink M\ndMk?1\n\n. (4.88)\n\nLaplace showed that the radius of convergence was e0 = 0.66274 . . . . This\nmethod is therefore unsuitable for eccentricities greater than this value. For\nsmall eccentricities, an expansion to order 3 in the eccentricity is given by\n(4.94).\n\nApproximate Result for Low Eccentricities\n\nWe express cosM and sinM using (4.83), going to first order in e. This\namounts to writing\n\ncos(e sinE) ? 1 , sin(e sinE) ? e sinE .\n\nWe thus obtain\n\ncosM = cos(E ? e sinE) ? cosE + e sin2E = e+ (1? e cosE) cosE ,\n\nsinM = sin(E ? e sinE) ? (1? e cosE) sinE ,\n\nwhich yields\n\ntanE ? sinM\ncosM ? e . (4.89)\n\n4.6 Representation of Anomalies\n\n4.6.1 Representation of Anomalies v(M) and E(M)\n\nDuring a period, up to a factor of n, the mean anomaly M thus represents\nthe time elapsed since the passage at point P . We can plot graphs giving the\nevolution of v and E as a function of time, i.e., the functions v(M) and E(M).\nOn the graphs shown here, M varies over one period, from M = ?? (S at A)\nto M = +? (S at A), passing through M = 0 (S at P ) (see Fig. 4.1).\n\nFigure 4.5 (upper) shows the function v(M) for various values of the ec-\ncentricity between e = 0.0 and e = 0.9, at intervals of 0.1. The two angles are\nequal when e = 0.0 (circular trajectory), while the deviation increases with e.\nWhen S is close to the periastron P (M = 0, v = 0), ever bigger variations in v\ncorrespond to small variations in M (i.e., the time) as e increases.

Angles in radians.\n\nLower: Dependence E(M) of the eccentric anomaly E, as in the upper graph.\n\n\n\n124 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nwhen S is close to the apoastron A (|M | = ?, |v| = ?), large variations in\nM correspond to small variations in v. This is of course an illustration of the\nareal law.\n\nFigure 4.5 (lower) shows the function E(M) for various values of the ec-\ncentricity between e = 0.0 and e = 0.9, at intervals of 0.1. As for the last\nfunction, the two angles are equal for e = 0.0 and the deviation increases with\ne, although in a less marked way than for v(M).\n\nFor all the figures in this Sect. 4.6, we consider the case e = 1.0. This is a\nlimiting case, as the eccentricity of the ellipse tends to unity from below.10\n\n4.6.2 Equation of Center\n\nIn Keplerian motion, it is useful to compare the true and mean anoma-\nlies. In astronomy, one defines the equation of center, denoted by EC, as the\ndifference between these two anomalies. This quantity11 is an angle:\n\nEC = v ?M . (4.90)\n\nWe shall need this when studying the apparent motion of the Sun around the\nEarth or Mars.\n\nThe graph of the function (v?M)(M) is shown in Fig. 4.6 (upper), which\nshould be compared with Fig. 4.5 (upper). The values of v corresponding to\nthe maximum and minimum of (v ? M) are symmetric with respect to the\norigin (the periastron).\n\nExample 4.3 Calculate the value and position of the extremum of the equation\nof center EC.\n\n? By symmetry, we consider EC = v?M for M taking values between 0 and\n?. The maximum of EC is given by dv = dM . From (4.81), we obtain the\nvalue rm for which EC is maximum, namely, rm =\n\n?\nab. Using (4.60), which\n\ngives r(a, e, v), we have\n\nrm =\na(1? e2)\n\n1 + e cos vm\n= a\n(\n1? e2\n\n)1/4\n,\n\n10For v(M), the graph is discontinuous: v(?) = ?\u00d7?(M) and v(0) = 0, denoting the sign\nof M by ?(M). For E(M), the representative curve is the reflection of M(E) = E ? sinE\nin the first bisector.\n\n11The term \u201cequation\u201d taken from algebra was defined in its modern sense by Descartes\nin 1637. Prior to this, at least as early as 1250, the word was used in astronomy. It was\nspecified and used by Kepler (\u00e6quatio, nis, in Latin) as \u201cthat variable quantity, determined\nby calculation, which must be added or subtracted from the mean motion to obtain the\ntrue motion\u201d. This is how one should understand the name \u201cequation of center\u201d, but also\n\u201cequation of time\u201d.\n\n\n\n4.6 Representation of Anomalies 125\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\n\n120\n\n150\n\n180\nEc = (u ?M )\n\nM\n\ne = 0.0\n\ne = 1.0\n\ne = 1.0\n\ne = 0.0\n\n+?\n\n+?/2\n\n??/2\n\n(u ?M )\n\nM\n\n??\n\n0\n\n??/2 +?/2 +?0??\n\nFig. 4.6 :Equation of center.

(4.100)\n\n4.6.3 Summary of Anomalies\n\nLet us sum up the results of the preceding sections. If we express the time\nt, represented by M , as a function of polar coordinates ? and r, represented\nby v and E, respectively, we obtain the analytical relations M(v) and M(E):\n\nv ??? M = M(v) , equation (4.59) ,\nE ??? M = M(E) equation (4.65) ,\nv = v(E) ?? E = E(v) equations (4.72) and (4.73) .\n\n\n\n128 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nIf we express the polar angle ?, represented by v, as a function of time t,\nitself represented by M , we must go through E, solving Kepler\u2019s problem by\niteration:\n\nM ??? E = E(M) iteration (4.85) ,\nE ??? v = v[E(M)] = v(M) equation (4.86) .\n\nWhen we study a particular trajectory, we generally consider a sequence of\ntimes t with a given separation, and at each time ti, ti+1, . . . , we solve Kepler\u2019s\nproblem to obtain the true anomaly.\n\nThe three anomalies v, E, and M do not play similar roles:\n\n\u2022 v(t) can be used to identify the position of the body on its orbit and to\ndetermine the radial vector r with the help of (4.26) or (4.60).\n\n\u2022 M(t) is in effect another way to represent time.\n\u2022 E(t) serves mainly to solve Kepler\u2019s problem, but it also arises in the\n\nLagrange equations of the perturbed motion [see (6.34) and (6.35)].\n\nExample 4.4 Calculate the true anomaly for the planet Mars when the mean\nanomaly is M = 98.679 ?. The eccentricity of the orbit of Mars around the\nSun is e = 0.09341.\n\n? We do the calculations using the various methods discussed above, the itera-\ntive method and the approximate methods, which are well suited to planetary\nmotions, up to a certain level of accuracy, since the eccentricity is low.\n\nIterative Method. Angles are given in degrees, but we convert them to\nradians for the calculation, or change e to (180/?)e to keep the angles in\ndegrees. Setting E0 = M , we obtain in successive iterative steps using (4.85):\n\nE0 = 98.679 , E1 = 103.896 , E2 = 103.875 , E3 = 103.875 .\n\nTwo iterations achieve the required accuracy. We find v using (4.86):\n\nE = E3 = 103.875 =? v = 109.020 .\n\nApproximate Formula (4.89). We obtain tanE = ?4.04648, which corre-\nsponds to an angle of ?76.119?, whence\n\nE = 180? 76.119 = 103.881 =? v = 109.027 .\n\nSeries Expansion of E = E(M) Using (4.94).

(4.101)\n\nExpressing r as a function of v, then of E and M , we obtain successively\nthe dependence of the speed on the anomalies. The function V (v) is given\nby (4.61) and V (E) by (4.69).

At\nperigee (anomaly = 0?, ? = 1?e) and at apogee (anomaly = 180?, ? = 1+e),\nthe values of the speed (Vp and Va, respectively) are the same for each of the\nthree graphs:\n\nVp\nVc\n\n=\n\n?\n1 + e\n\n1? e ,\nVa\nVc\n\n=\n\n?\n1? e\n1 + e\n\n,\nVp\nVa\n\n=\n1 + e\n\n1? e .\n\nFor example, for e = 0.6, (1 + e)/(1? e) = 4 and hence Vp/Vc = 2.0, Va/Vc =\n0.5, and Va/Vp = 4.

Writing the velocity V in the form V = Vrer + V?e?, the angle ? between\nV and r is given by tan? = V?/Vr.

Following\nthis rather detailed solution, we shall now give a brief presentation of a more\nsynthetic method. The motivation for this is that it brings out the quantities\nremaining constant throughout the motion. These values are obtained with\njust one integration, to go from r? to r?. This is why they are referred to as\nfirst integrals of the motion. Starting from the equation of motion in the case\nof a Newtonian acceleration, viz.,\n\nr? = ? ?\nr2\n\ner , (4.104)\n\nwe obtain the conservation of energy, angular momentum, and Laplace vector\n(which gives the equation of motion).\n\nConservation of Energy\n\nWe take the scalar product of both sides of (4.104) with the velocity\nvector r? :\n\n\n\n4.7 First Integrals of the Motion 137\n\nr?\u00b7r? = 1\n2\n\nd\n\ndt\n\n(\nr?2\n)\n=\n\n1\n\n2\n\nd\n\ndt\n\n(\nr?2\n)\n,\n\n? ?\nr2\n\ner\u00b7r? = ? ?\nr2\n\nr? =\nd\n\ndt\n\n(?\nr\n\n)\n.\n\nEquation (4.104) thus gives\n\nd\n\ndt\n\n(\n1\n\n2\nr?2 ? ?\n\nr\n\n)\n= 0 , (4.105)\n\nwhence\n\nK = 1\n2\nr?2 ? ?\n\nr\n= constant . (4.106)\n\nThis expresses conservation of energy. We recover (4.33) by setting V 2 = r?2.\n\nConservation of Angular Momentum\n\nWe take the vector product of each side of (4.104) with the radial vector\nr. This yields\n\nr ? r? = ? ?\nr2\n\nr ? er = 0 .\n\nUsing the derivative (4.5) of the definition (4.4), we obtain\n\nC = r ? r? = constant , (4.107)\n\nwhich expresses conservation of angular momentum. The motion is restricted\nto a plane. We recover the relation (4.9).\n\nConservation of the Laplace Vector: Equation for the Trajectory\n\nWe consider the vector product of the acceleration and the angular mo-\nmentum:\n\nr? ?C = ? ?\nr2\n\ner ? r2??k = ???e? = ?\nder\ndt\n\n.\n\nNow, since C is constant, we have\n\nd\n\ndt\n(r? ?C) = r? ?C ,\n\nwhence\n\nd\n\ndt\n(r? ?C) = d\n\ndt\n(?er) . (4.108)\n\n\n\n138 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nConsidering this relation, we define the vector ?, known as the Laplace vector\n(or Laplace\u2013Runge\u2013Lenz vector), which has the property of being a constant\nvector:\n\n? =\nr? ?C\n?\n\n? er = constant . (4.109)\n\nThis vector? is perpendicular to C, since r??C and er are both perpendicular\nto C. It thus lies in the plane of motion. In order to evaluate ?, we calculate\nr? ?C :\n\nr? ?C =\n(\nr?er + r??e?\n\n)\n? Ck = C\n\n(\nr??er ? r?e?\n\n)\n.\n\nIf we project ? onto er and use the value of C given by (4.6), we have\n\n?\u00b7er =\n(\nC\n\n?\n\nr2??\n\nr\ner ? er\n\n)\n\u00b7er = 1\n\nr\n\nC2\n\n?\n? 1 .\n\nWe thus obtain the expression for r :\n\nr =\nC2\n\n?\n\n1\n\n1 +?\u00b7er . (4.110)\n\nLet v be the angle between the radial vector and the fixed vector ?. Setting\n?\u00b7er = ??? cos v and p = C2/?, we find that the trajectory is an ellipse.\nComparing formulas, we see that ??? corresponds to the eccentricity. The\ndistance r goes through a minimum when the vectors ? and er are collinear\n(with v = 0): the vector ? goes through the periastron and v therefore repre-\nsents the true anomaly as defined earlier. Once the Laplace vector ? is known,\nwe automatically have the eccentricity and the direction of the periastron.\n\nNote. The conservation of these quantities is expressed by Noether\u2019s\ntheorem.12\n\n12Emmy Noether (1882\u20131935) was a German mathematician, considered as the founder\nof modern algebra (inventor of rings and ideals). Noether\u2019s theorem (1918) says that a\nconservation law is a consequence of the invariance of a physical law under a continuous\ntransformation with one parameter. (This is proven using the Lagrangian formalism for the\nequations of classical mechanics.) As far as we are concerned here:\n\n\u2022 Conservation of momentum results from the invariance of the laws of physics under\ntranslation, due to the homogeneity of space.\n\n\u2022 Conservation of angular momentum results from the invariance of the laws of physics\nunder rotation, due to the isotropy of space.\n\n\u2022 Conservation of energy results from the invariance of the laws of physics under time\ntranslations, due to the uniformity of the flow of time.\n\n\n\n4.7 First Integrals of the Motion 139\n\n4.7.2 Note on Energy\n\nWhen we study the Keplerian motion of a satellite, its mass never enters\nour considerations.13 This is why we have always spoken of acceleration rather\nthan force. Everything we have said so far can be recast. For example, one\ncould speak of a Newtonian force applied to a material point S of mass m.\nThis would lead us to introduce the standard definition of energy. In the case\nof a Newtonian attraction, the force is\n\nF = ?m ?\nr2\n\ner .\n\nThis corresponds to a potential energy U (recalling that F = ?grad U , with\nthe convention that U vanishes for infinite r),\n\nU = ?m?\nr\n.\n\nThe point S, moving at speed V has kinetic energy T given by\n\nT = 1\n2\nmV 2 .\n\nThe mechanical energy E is thus\n\nE = T + U = m\n(\nV 2\n\n2\n? ?\n\nr\n\n)\n. (4.111)\n\nThe angular momentum L is by definition\n\nL = r ?mr? . (4.112)\n\nThe quantities considered earlier are thus equivalent to those related to the\nenergy:\n\nK = E\nm\n\n, C =\nL\n\nm\n.\n\nEquation (4.33), which establishes that K is constant, is thus equivalent to\n\nE = mK = constant , (4.113)\n\nwhich expresses the conservation of mechanical energy E .\nFor periodic motion, (4.38) yields\n\nE = ?1\n2\nm\n?\n\na\n, (4.114)\n\nwhich is negative, due to the convention U(?) = 0. We see that a is related\nto E/m, which shows that the period depends only on the mechanical energy\nper unit mass of the material point under consideration.\n\n13In the study of perturbed motion, the mass of the body is relevant in certain specific\ninstances, such as the study of air resistance in the upper atmosphere or radiation pressure.\n\n\n\n140 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nFig. 4.12 :Trajectories and energy. The distance from the focus to the periastron is\n\nconstant. The minimal energy ?E0 corresponds to the orbital insertion speed, and the\ntrajectory is a circle. We then give the object an energy E = ?E0(1? e), where e is\nthe eccentricity, given in steps of 0.1. As the energy increases, the elliptical trajectory\n\nmoves further and further off center, until it becomes a parabola for e = 1 (thick\n\nblack curve). Then for e > 1, the trajectory is one concave branch of a hyperbola.\n\n\n\n4.8 Historical Note on Universal Attraction 141\n\nExample 4.8 Trajectories of various point objects in orbit around a pointlike\ncenter of attraction, with different energies, but having the same distance at\nperiastron (perigee).\n\n? We consider a point of mass m in a circular orbit of radius r0. It has energy\n\nE = ?E0 , with E0 =\n1\n\n2\nm\n\n?\n\nr0\n.\n\nIf we increase the energy while fixing the distance at perigee (focus\u2013perigee\ndistance rp = r0), the eccentricity increases:\n\nrp = a(1? e) = r0 , a =\nr0\n\n1? e , p = a(1? e\n2) = (1 + e)r0 ,\n\nand the energy is\n\nE = ?1\n2\nm\n\n?\n\nr0\n(1? e) = ?E0(1? e) .\n\nThe trajectories are shown in Fig. 4.12 when the eccentricity increases in steps\nof 0.10. For e = 0, with negative energy E = ?E0, the trajectory is a circle. It\nbecomes an ellipse, ever further off center, as the energy increases, provided\nthat e < 1. For e = 1, with energy E = 0, the trajectory is a parabola. For\ne > 1, with energy E > 0, the trajectory is a hyperbola (concave branch).\nWhen the trajectory is given in polar coordinates using (1.17) or (4.60), a\nis positive for the ellipses, infinite for the parabola, and negative for the hy-\nperbolas. Sign conventions can be avoided by using the parameter p in the\ngeneral equation for the conic sections, as in (1.16). ?\n\n4.8 Historical Note on Universal Attraction\n\n4.8.1 Kepler\u2019s Laws\n\nSince ancient times, astronomy had been dominated by Ptolemy\u2019s14 geo-\ncentric system, but by the fifteenth century, the inadequacies of this system\nhad become clear to several astronomers, for instance, in the universities of\n\n14Claudius Ptolemaios (+\n??#??\t ???\n??????\t), who lived roughly from 90 to 168 AD,\nwas a Greek mathematician, astronomer, and geographer from Alexandria (Claudius is a\nRoman first name, while Ptolemaios is a Greek name ? ???\n??????\t? ??, meaning warlike).\nHe wrote a number of things, the best known being the Geography and the Almagest. In the\nGeography (which means literally \u201cdrawing of the Earth\u201d), he situates hundreds of places,\nincluding towns, mountains, and others, with the correct latitude and somewhat overesti-\nmated longitudes. In the Almagest (a title attributed to it later by Arab astronomers, from\nAl, \u201cthe\u201d, the definite article in Arabic, and megistos, the superlative of mega, in Greek,\nmeaning \u201cvery big\u201d), he presents the geocentric planetary system, called the Ptolemaic sys-\ntem. To obtain good agreement between observation and model, he has each planet (and\nin particular Mars) describe a circle called an epicycle, whose center moves around another\ncircle, called the deferent, centered on the motionless Earth. He refined this model with the\neccentric (shifted deferent), the equant point, and other modifications. The work of Ptolemy,\nthe last astronomer of the ancient world, was transmitted to Europe by the Arabs, where\nit formed the foundation of astronomy in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\n\n\n\n142 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nFig. 4.13 :Kepler\u2019s Astronomia Nova, edited in Prague in 1609\u2014MDCIX. Left: Title\n\npage. Right: First page.\n\nBologna or Padua. However, Copernicus15 was the first to reject the geocentric\nsystem in favour of a heliocentric model.\n\n15Nicolaj Kopernik (1473\u20131543), in Latin Nicolaus Copernicus Torinensis, was a Polish\nastronomer. Following his studies in Italy, Copernicus returned to Poland and devised a\ncosmological system which replaced the Earth by the Sun as the center of the Universe.\nThis was the heliocentric, or Copernican system, in which the orbit of each planet is a\nsphere centered on the Sun. He completed his treatise De Revolutionibus orbium c\u0153lestium\naround 1530. However, fearing the reaction of both the Catholic hierarchy and the newly\nborn Lutheran movement, he held back the publication. The book was finally printed in\nNuremberg in 1543, the year of his death, thanks to the determination of his pupil Rheticus.\nThe editor Petreius demanded a preface, but we do not know whether the author gave\nhis agreement. Written by the theologian Osiander, it warned the reader that the system\nthere described was merely a way of looking at the problem that could help to carry out\ncalculations, and that it in no way put in doubt the Bible.\n\nIn those days, the authorities had radical ways of dealing with anyone foolish enough\nto contest religious dogma or biblical truths. The doctor Michel Servet, of Spanish origin,\nwas the first to carry out a scientific investigation of the blood circulation. As a result, he\nwas arrested in 1553 in the Protestant republic of Geneva, condemned to death, and burnt\nat the stake under the eye of Calvin himself.\n\nAs it turned out, it was not until 1616 that De Revolutionibus was finally listed on the\nIndex of the Holy Office. For decades, the book was unfavourably viewed by astronomers. Its\nmessage was too radically different, and on top of that, it did not provide good predictions.\nFor the planet Mars, the positions given by Copernicus were less accurate than those given\nby Ptolemy\u2019s epicycles!\n\n\n\n4.8 Historical Note on Universal Attraction 143\n\nFig. 4.14 :Kepler\u2019s Astronomia Nova. Page 132, showing the three systems: Coper-\n\nnican (heliocentric), Ptolemaic (geocentric), and the hybrid system due to Tycho\n\nBrahe.\n\n\n\n144 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nAs can be seen from Figs. 4.13 and 4.14, Kepler favoured the new and\n\u201crevolutionary\u201d system. Using observations made by Tycho Brahe,16 he ex-\nplained the motion of the planets in the Solar System by the following three\npropositions (Kepler\u2019s laws)17:\n\n1. Law of ellipses. The trajectory of each planet lies in a plane (a) and it is\nan ellipse in which one focus is the Sun (b).\n\n16Tyge Brahe, commonly known as Tycho Brahe, (1546\u20131601), was a Danish astronomer.\nHe spent 20 years in his observatory in Uraniborg (\u201cCity of the Sky\u201d), in Denmark, making\nvery accurate astronomical measurements. He was the first to take into account the refrac-\ntion of light. The accuracy of his observations was 1? (1 arcmin, or 1/60 of a degree), while\nhis contemporaries were not doing better than 10?. He measured the motion of the planet\nMars, observing ten oppositions. His model of the Universe was a compromise between\nPtolemy\u2019s geocentric model and the heliocentric model of Copernicus. In 1597, he left for\nBohemia where he worked with Kepler to set up the astronomical tables known as Tabulae\nRudolphinae.\n\n17The German astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630), in Latin Ioannes Keplerus,\npublished the first two laws in 1609, inAstronomia Nova ???????????? seu Physica C\u0153lestis,\nand the third in 1619, in Harmonices Mundi. However, it would be wrong to think that the\nlaws appear in a totally clear manner in these writings, as they would in today\u2019s scientific\npapers. The mathematical terminology was heavy and the explanations hard to follow.\nThere are even cases of one error of reasoning balancing out another.\n\nThe first of these two books is almost exclusively devoted to describing the orbit of\nMars (whence the subtitle Tradita comentariis de motibus stell\u00e6 Martis ex observationibus\nG.V. Tychonis Brahe). The second law appears at the beginning of this work and the first\nat the end. Naturally, they concern only the elliptical trajectory of the planet Mars. The\nGreek word attached to the title Astronomia Nova is the substantive arising from the verb\n?,???\n????, meaning \u201cto seek causes\u201d. But although these works seem difficult to follow\nnowadays, they nevertheless attest to the extraordinary discoveries made by their author.\nTo demonstrate the eccentricity of the orbit of Mars or the Earth required a great level of\ntrust in Tycho Brahe\u2019s observations, made with the naked eye, and a considerable degree\nof mathematical ability. Many other moral qualities were also involved. Courage and self-\nconfidence were essential to take such a revolutionary theory to its logical conclusions in\nthe face of universal opposition, in a climate of family problems and widespread religious\nhostility, as the wars of religion tore Europe apart. Perseverance was another quality we may\nsafely attribute: in Astronomia Nova, following fifteen pages of close calculations, Kepler\ntells us that he had to repeat them seventy times in order to arrive at the result. In his own\nwords: \u201cIf this method seems possible and tedious, take pity on me, for I undertook these\ncalculations 70 times, and you should not be surprised to find that I have spent 5 years\non the theory of Mars. There will no doubt be several subtle geometers, like Vie?te, who\nwill say that the method is not geometric. But let them solve the problem themselves if\nthey are not satisfied.\u201d This can help us to understand the astonishing clause in the title\nof Astronomia Nova (see Fig. 4.14): Plurium annorum pertinaci studio elaborata Prag\u00e6\n(Written in Prague after several years of obstinate effort).\n\nKepler was deeply convinced that the cosmic and hence divine order had to be perfect,\nand had great difficulty renouncing the perfection of the circular orbit in favour of the\nellipse, blemished as it was by the failings of the real world. Throughout his approach to\nscience, Kepler was guided by this search for divine harmony. In his last work, this led to\nthe musical harmony of the planets and the geometrical harmony of the regular polyhedra\n(Platonic solids) he fitted around the planetary orbits. In this context, Kepler wrote: \u201cThere\nare six planets because there are five regular polyhedra. I cannot begin to express my wonder\nbefore this discovery.\u201d\n\n\n\n4.8 Historical Note on Universal Attraction 145\n\n2. Areal law. The areas swept out by the radial vector are proportional to the\ntime it takes to sweep them out.\n\n3. Harmonic law. The square of the period of revolution is proportional to the\ncube of the length of the major axis.\n\nThese correspond to our earlier equations in the following way:\n\nLaw (1a) ?? equation (4.8) ,\nLaw (1b) ?? equation (4.40) ,\nLaw (2) ?? equation (4.14) ,\nLaw (3) ?? equation (4.53) .\n\nNote that laws (1a) and (2) apply in the case of central accelerations, and\nlaws (1b) and (3) in the case of central accelerations with 1/r2 dependence,\ni.e., Newtonian accelerations.\n\nAt the end of Chap. 15, in the historical note on Kepler and the planet Mars\n(see Sect. 15.11), we display certain passages from Astronomia Nova which\nattest to the accuracy and originality of Kepler\u2019s work. At the end of Chap. 16,\nin the historical note on Kepler and the Solar System (see Sect. 16.10), we\ninclude two tables of values from Harmonices Mundi which Kepler used to\nestablish his third law.\n\n4.8.2 Newton and the Law of Universal Attraction\n\nWhile Kepler was the founder of celestial mechanics, it was Galileo18 who\nlaid the foundations for terrestrial mechanics, at the same period. But it\n\n18Galileo Galilei (1564\u20131642) was an Italian physicist and astronomer. Founder of dy-\nnamics and the first genuine experimenter, he studied the free fall of bodies and parabolic\nmotion. He propounded the principle of inertia, which corresponds to Newton\u2019s first law.\nShortly after the invention of the refracting telescope, he began to use this instrument to\nobserve the sky. In 1610, he discovered four moons in orbit around Jupiter, and it was this\nobservation that persuaded him that the Earth and the other planets were in orbit around\nthe Sun. The discovery of the crescent of Venus (impossible in a geocentric system) con-\nfirmed this idea and he communicated it to Kepler. Galileo recorded all his astronomical\ndiscoveries in Sidereus Nuncius (the Celestial Messenger).\n\nAn unfailing advocate of the Copernican system, Galileo was condemned for the first\ntime by the Inquisition on 16 February 1616, under the papacy of Paul V. In 1632, he\npublished Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo, Tolemaico et Copernicano. This\nwas not written in Latin, but in the local vernacular or volgare of Italy or Tuscany. That, too,\nwas revolutionary. In this work, he made his preferences perfectly clear and was condemned a\nsecond time for heresy on 22 June 1633, under the papacy of Urban VIII, who proclaimed:\n\u201cThe opinion that the Sun sits motionless at the center of the world is absurd, a false\nphilosophy, and formally heretical, because it explicitly contradicts the Holy Scriptures.\u201d\nOnly by getting down on his knees and abjuring did he avoid being burnt at the stake. But\nhe was still imprisoned at the age of 70 and ended his days under house arrest.\n\nAt the end of the twentieth century, a Vatican commission was convened in 1981 under\nJohn Paul II to reconsider what had been done to Galileo. Its conclusions were announced\non 31 October 1992: the Church recognised the errors of Galileo\u2019s judges but was unable to\nproclaim his vindication.\n\n\n\n146 Chapter 4. Keplerian Motion\n\nFig. 4.15 :Newton\u2019s Principia, published in London in 1687\u2014MDCLXXXVII. Left:\n\nTitle page. Right: Page 50, where Newton shows geometrically that, if the point P ,\n\nsubject to a force with center S, describes an ellipse with focus at S, then this force\n\nis inversely proportional to the square of the distance SP .\n\nrequired the genius of Newton to synthesise these two aspects of the same\nphenomenon into a single idea: the universal law of attraction. Today, we\nshow that an attraction of type 1/r2 between the Sun and the planets leads\nto an elliptical trajectory for the planets. But historically, Newton had to\npiece together the rudiments of infinitesimal calculus (called the method of\nfluxions) and, starting from the elliptical trajectories discovered by Kepler,\ndeduce that the forces at play had to have the 1/r2 dependence, whereupon\nhe could put forward his law of universal attraction (see Fig. 4.15).\n\nLet us rewrite Newton\u2019s demonstration using the notation of modern math-\nematics. We begin, as he did, with the principle that the forces were central.\nWe consider a material point, whose position is defined by a radial vector r\ndescribing an ellipse. We can then write\n\nu =\n1\n\nr\n=\n\n1 + e cos ?\n\na(1? e2) , (4.115)\n\nfrom which we deduce\n\ndu\n\nd?\n= ? e sin ?\n\na(1? e2) ,\nd2u\n\nd?2\n= ? e cos ?\n\na(1? e2) .\n\nSubstituting this into Binet\u2019s equation (4.21), which we recall refers to central\nforces, we obtain\n\n\n\n4.8 Historical Note on Universal Attraction 147\n\nFig. 4.16 :British stamp commemorating Newton\u2019s\n\nwork.\n\nr? = ?C2u2\n[\n? e cos ?\na(1? e2) +\n\n1 + e cos ?\n\na(1? e2)\n\n]\ner\n\n= ?C2u2 1\na(1? e2)er = ?\n\nC2\n\na(1? e2)\n1\n\nr2\ner .\n\nNow C is given by ?ab = CT/2 (this is the areal law, which also refers to\ncentral forces), i.e.,\n\nC =\n2?\n\nT\na2\n?\n1? e2 .\n\nWe can therefore deduce that\n\nr? = ?4?\n2\n\nT 2\na3\n\n1\n\nr2\ner , (4.116)\n\nwhereby we obtain\n\nr? = ? ?\nr2\n\ner , with ? =\n4?2\n\nT 2\na3 .\n\nTycho Brahe\u2019s observations as interpreted by Kepler showed that this quantity\n? remains constant for all planets gravitating around the Sun. Newton thus\ndeduced that it could be written in the form\n\n? = GMS ,\n\nwhere MS is the mass of the Sun and G is a universal constant.\nFinally, the attractive force exerted by a body of mass M on a body of\n\nmass m (and conversely) could be written\n\nF = mr? = ?GMm\nr2\n\ner . (4.117)\n\nThis is indeed the law of universal attraction between two bodies of masses\nM and m, where G is the gravitational constant (Fig. 4.16).\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nSatellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nFrom now on, we shall be mainly concerned with the periodic motion of a\nbody, the artificial satellite,1 in the gravitational field of the Earth.\n\n5.1 Two-Body Problem\n\nWe consider two bodies A1 and A2, with masses m1 and m2, respectively,\nmoving in a Galilean frame (O0;x, y, z). The system is isolated in the sense\nthat each body feels only the attractive force of the other. This is the statement\nof the two-body problem. The aim is to determine the motion of the two\nbodies.\n\n1In latin, satelles, satellitis was a bodyguard, soldier, assistant, or accomplice. The\norigins of the word are obscure. Some claim an Etruscan origin. The word satelite appears\nin French around 1265 to denote an armed man who carries out the orders of a commander,\nthen in the form satellite, around 1500, to refer to a man depending in some way on\nanother, or accompanying another. It was Kepler, in 1611, who gave it the modern meaning\nof \u201csatellite\u201d in the Latin term satelles, which he used to refer to the four satellites of\nJupiter, recently discovered by Galileo with his refracting telescope. He wrote: De quattuor\nJovis satellibus erronibus, that is, \u201cConcerning the four wandering companions of Jupiter\u201d.\nThe term \u201cartificial satellite\u201d appeared around 1950.\n\nIn many languages, \u201csatellite\u201d is expressed by a word coming directly from the Latin\nterm modernised by Kepler, as in the Latin and Anglo-Saxon languages. In others, it is the\nword for \u201cmoon\u201d which is used, as in Arabic, qamar s.ana?\u2019i, meaning \u201cartificial moon\u201d.\n\nHowever, certain languages have kept to the first idea of satelles. In modern Greek, the\nsatellite is still a bodyguard, since it is called doryphoros, ? #???&)??\t? ??, \u201carmed with\na spear\u201d, built up from ?? #)??? ???\t, \u201cspear\u201d, and the suffix &??)\t, \u201cwhich carries\u201d. In\nRussian, sputnik is the travel companion (put, \u201cway\u201d). In Chinese, the satellite is called\nwei xing, \u201cguardian star\u201d, a word written with the two ideograms wei, \u201cguard\u201d, and xing,\n\u201cstar\u201d. The same form is found in Japanese.\n\nM.

Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nTaking an arbitrary origin O, Newton\u2019s second law takes the form\n\nm1\nd2OA1\ndt2\n\n= ?Gm1m2\nA1A2\n\n?A1A2?3\n,\n\nm2\nd2OA2\ndt2\n\n= ?Gm1m2\nA2A1\n\n?A2A1?3\n,\n\nwhich yields the relation\n\nm1\nd2OA1\ndt2\n\n+m2\nd2OA2\ndt2\n\n= 0 . (5.1)\n\nThe barycenter C of the two points A1 and A2 (also called the center of mass)\nis defined by\n\nm1OA1 +m2OA2 = (m1 +m2)OC .\n\nWe thus have\n\nd2OC\n\ndt2\n= 0 =? OC = v0t+ u0 ,\n\nwhere the vectors v0 and u0 are constant.\nSince C is in uniform motion with respect to (O0;x, y, z), this shows that\n\nthe frame (C;x, y, z) is Galilean. Using (5.1) and the expressions for the ac-\ncelerations, we obtain\n\nd2A1A2\ndt2\n\n= ?G(m1 +m2)\nA1A2\n\n?A1A2?3\n. (5.2)\n\nTaking the barycenter C of these two points as the origin, we thus have\n\nr1 = CA1 , r2 = CA2 , r12 = r2 ? r1 ,\n\nand from the definition of the barycenter,\n\nm1r1 +m2r2 = 0 .\n\nEquation (5.2) gives the equation of motion:\n\nr?12 = ?G(m1 +m2)\nr12\n\n?r12?3\n, (5.3)\n\nas observed with respect to a Galilean frame of reference.\nThe motion of the points A1 and A2 can then be deduced from the motion\n\nof r12 via the relations\n\nr1 = ?\nm2\n\nm1 +m2\nr12 , r2 = +\n\nm1\nm1 +m2\n\nr12 .\n\n\n\n5.2 Orbital Elements 151\n\nAs an example, for the motion of the Moon (A2) around the Earth (A1), we\nhave m1 = 81 m2: the motion is studied relative to the barycenter of the\nEarth\u2013Moon system.\n\nFor an artificial satellite (A2) around the Earth (A1), m2 is negligible in\ncomparison with m1 and we have\n\nr1 = 0 , r2 = r12 .\n\nIn brief, the motion of an artificial satellite around the Earth will be treated\nas follows:\n\n\u2022 To begin with, it will be considered as a two-body problem in which one\nbody (the satellite) has negligible mass compared with the other. It will\ntherefore be in Keplerian motion and the orbit it follows will be called the\nKeplerian orbit.\n\n\u2022 In a second step, this motion will be considered to be perturbed. The real\norbit which results will be called the perturbed orbit.\n\n5.2 Orbital Elements\n\n5.2.1 Specifying the Satellite Orbit in Space\n\nFrame of Reference\n\nThe fundamental principle of mechanics known as the Galilean principle\nof relativity says that the properties of space and time are the same, and the\nlaws of mechanics are identical, in all inertial frames of reference.\n\nWe consider a satellite in periodic motion around the Earth. Let us define\nthe frame (O;x, y, z). The origin O is the center of the Earth, which is taken\nto be a sphere ?. The axis Oz is the axis joining the poles, oriented from\nthe south to the north. The plane xOy is the equatorial plane of the Earth,\ndenoted E , which cuts the terrestrial sphere at the equator. The axis Ox is\nchosen arbitrarily to point towards a distant star or the vernal point. The\naxis Oy is deduced from the other two axes in such a way as to obtain a\nright-handed orthonormal frame. The frame associated with this coordinate\nsystem is considered to be Galilean and will be denoted by ? (see Fig. 5.1).\n\nThe motion of the satellite is Keplerian, i.e., in ?, the trajectory is a conic\nsection, in this case an ellipse, with one focus at the center of attraction O,\nand lying in a plane P . The trajectory of the satellite is called the orbit.2\nThe plane P is called the orbital plane. For Keplerian motion, one speaks of\na Keplerian or Kepler orbit.\n\n2From the old French orbite, first attested in 1314. It derives from the Latin orbita, \u00e6,\nmeaning \u201cmark left by a wheel\u201d, then \u201cclosed curve described by a heavenly body\u201d. The\nword made its appearance in astronomy in the seventeenth century, then in astronautics in\naround 1950 for artificial satellites.\n\n\n\n152 Chapter 5.

Projection of points on the\n\nground track: S0 is the projection of the point S (satellite) and P0 is the projection of\n\nthe perigee P onto the ground track. N0 and N\n?\n0 are the projections of the ascending\n\nnode N and the descending node N ? onto the ground track. The equatorial plane of\nthe Earth is (xOy, N0, N\n\n?\n0), normal to the polar axis Oz. The orbital plane is (O,\n\nP0, S0, N0, N\n?\n0), normal to OZ. Four of the orbital elements are the right ascension\n\n? of the ascending node, the inclination i, the argument of the perigee ?, and the\n\ntrue anomaly v. The other two orbital elements specify the ellipse, viz., the semi-\n\nmajor axis a and the eccentricity e, not shown in the figure. Upper image: Orbit\n\nviewed in a Galilean frame.\n\n\n\n5.2 Orbital Elements 153\n\nIn this Galilean frame, the orbital plane P is fixed. Let OZ denote the\nstraight line perpendicular to P at O. The intersection of the planes P and E\nis a straight line through O, called the line of nodes. The two nodes are the\npoints of intersection of the orbit and the terrestrial equatorial plane E , with\nN the ascending node, where the satellite passes from the southern hemisphere\nto the northern hemisphere, and N ? the descending node, where the satellite\npasses from the northern hemisphere to the southern hemisphere.\n\nSpecifying a Point on an Orbit\n\nIn order to specify a point in Keplerian motion in space, the first step is\nto identify the orbit, and then the point on the orbit. We thus define succes-\nsively:\n\n\u2022 the location of the orbital plane in this frame,\n\u2022 the position of the elliptical orbit in this plane,\n\u2022 the characteristics of the ellipse,\n\u2022 the position of the moving point, i.e., the satellite, on the orbit.\n\nWe shall find that six parameters are necessary and sufficient to determine\nthe position of the satellite in ?. Let us now go through each of these points.\n\nLocating the Orbital Plane in the Frame. Two angles, those of the\nspherical coordinate system, fix P relative to E , given that P contains O.\nThese angles are an azimuthal angle and a height angle. The angle ? of the\nplane E , which specifies the line of nodes (in the direction of the ascending\nnode) relative to the zero axis, is called the right ascension of the ascending\nnode:\n\n? = (Ox,ON) .\n\nThe angle i is the dihedral angle i = (E ,P) between the orbital and equatorial\nplanes. This is called the inclination. It can also be defined in terms of the\nnormals to the planes by\n\ni = (Oz,OZ) .\n\nAll possible positions of P relative to E are obtained as ? varies over the\ninterval [0, 2?) and i varies over [0, ?).\n\nCharacterising the Ellipse. Since its focus is at O, the center of attraction,\nthe ellipse is characterised by two parameters, its semi-major axis a and its\neccentricity e.\n\nLocating the Ellipse in the Orbital Plane. The ellipse is specified in\nP by choosing the position of a point, traditionally the perigee P , and then\nspecifying the argument of the perigee ?, which is the angle between the\napsidal line and the line of nodes:\n\n? = (ON ,OP ) .\n\n\n\n154 Chapter 5. Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nLocating the Satellite in Its Orbit. A point S on the ellipse is perfectly\ndetermined by its polar angle, centered on O. This is the true anomaly v,\nalready defined as\n\nv = (OP ,OS) .\n\nThe mean anomaly M is general preferred over v. In Chap. 4, we considered\nthe bijective relation between these two variables [see (4.59)].\n\nWe can also use the angle ?, called the position on orbit or the argument\nof the latitude, or the nodal elongation, defined by\n\n? = ? + v , (5.4)\n\nwhich specifies the position of S relative to the ascending node.\n\n5.2.2 Keplerian Elements\n\nThe parameters discussed above define the orbit and the position of the\nsatellite on the orbit. These parameters constitute the six orbital elements,\nalso known as the Keplerian elements. They are generally presented in the\nfollowing order:\n\na , e , i , ? , ? , M .\n\nThe parameter a has dimensions of length, whilst the five others (e and the\nfour angles) are dimensionless.\n\nSix parameters, including at least one length, are necessary and sufficient\nto specify the motion of a point. The position of a point (3 position coordi-\nnates) and its velocity (the 3 velocity components) at a given time can provide\nthe initial conditions required to integrate the equations of motion, thereby\ndetermining the position of a point on its trajectory (3 + 3 = 6 parameters).\n\nOther sets than the Kepler elements can be used. We may also use those\nof Laplace, Delaunay, Hill, or others. Each is designed to meet different needs.\nThe six Keplerian elements play a clear didactic role in the study of perturbed\nmotion, because it is then easy to see which ones vary and which ones do not\n(see Table 5.1). These angles can be expressed in terms of the Euler angles\n(see the appendix to the chapter in Sect. 5.4).\n\nIn Chap. 8, and in particular in Sect. 8.4, we discuss the orbital elements\nthat are used in practice to locate satellites to high levels of accuracy. We\nshall then establish the relation between these elements and the Keplerian\nelements discussed above.\n\n5.2.3 Adapted Orbital Elements\n\nIn certain cases, the Keplerian elements do not provide a precise enough\nsystem of parameters. They are then combined in such a way as to provide\n\n\n\n5.2 Orbital Elements 155\n\nAngle Angle Range Plane Euler angle\n\n? R.A. of ascending node (Ox,ON0) 0\u2013360 ?

We shall now list the combinations used to get\naround the difficulties. No attempt has been made to give more than a simple\ninventory. These methods are used for a highly refined description of satellite\nmotion (accurate positioning and station-keeping), which lie beyond the scope\nof the present book.\n\nNear-Circular Orbits\n\nFor eccentricities close to zero, the orbit is said to be near-circular. The\nperigee is then poorly defined, in the sense that small fluctuations in e lead to\nlarge variations in ?. Moreover, in this case, v andM are very close. To specify\nthe position of the satellite in its orbit, it is more convenient to take the origin\nat the ascending node, with ?? = ? + M , than at the perigee, with M . The\nKeplerian elements are then replaced by the following adapted parameters:\n\na , ex = e cos? , ey = e sin? , i , ? , ?? = ? +M .\n\nNear-Equatorial Orbits\n\nIf the orbit lies almost in the equatorial plane, the ascending node is ill-\ndefined. There may even be discontinuities in ? when the plane of the orbit\ncrosses the equatorial plane: the ascending node becomes the descending node.\nIn this case, it is preferable to use the following parameters:\n\na , e , ?? = ? +? , hx = 2 sin\ni\n\n2\ncos? , hy = 2 sin\n\ni\n\n2\nsin? , M .\n\nNear-Circular Near-Equatorial Orbits\n\nIf the conditions of the last two cases are brought together simultaneously\n(as in the case of geostationary satellites), neither the line of nodes nor the\napsidal line are clearly defined. We then use the angles ?? = ? + ? and ?? =\n?? +M = ? +? +M . Suitable adapted parameters are as follows:\n\na , e cos ?? , e sin ?? , 2 sin\ni\n\n2\ncos? , 2 sin\n\ni\n\n2\nsin? , ?? .\n\n\n\n156 Chapter 5. Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\n5.3 Keplerian Period\n\nWhatever the eccentricity of an elliptical orbit may be, the Keplerian pe-\nriod is given by (4.53). We denote this by T0 to distinguish it from periods\ndefined for perturbed motion:\n\nT0 = 2?\n\n?\na3\n\n?\n. (5.5)\n\nIt is convenient to define the period T0(h=0) of a fictitious satellite in circular\norbit at ground level on a spherical Earth of radius R :\n\nT0(h=0) = 2?\n\n?\nR3\n\n?\n. (5.6)\n\nWe also define the reduced (dimensionless) distance ? = a/R of the satellite\nfrom the center of the Earth, as already given in (2.38). We may then express\nT0 in terms of a, ?, or h :\n\nT0(a)\n\nT0(h=0)\n=\n( a\nR\n\n)3/2\n, (5.7)\n\nT0(?) = ?\n3/2T0(h=0) . (5.8)\n\nNumerical calculation of the period of the satellite orbiting at ground level\ngives\n\nT0(h=0) = 5,069.34 s = 84.4891 min . (5.9)\n\nThe maximal number of revolutions per day is therefore, for an Earth-orbiting\nsatellite,\n\n?0(h=0) = 17.044 . (5.10)\n\nThis notion of daily orbital frequency is further developed in Chap. 7.\nFigure 5.2 can be used as a quick way to evaluate the period as a function\n\nof altitude. Several satellite appellations appear on the figure (LEO, MEO,\nGEO). These will be explained later.\n\nFor a near-circular orbit, we define the height h above a spherical Earth\nby\n\nh = a?R , R = Re = equatorial radius .\n\nEquation (5.8) becomes\n\nT0(h) =\n\n(\n1 +\n\nh\n\nR\n\n)3/2\nT0(h=0) .\n\n\n\n5.3 Keplerian Period 157\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.5\n\n6.0\n\n6.5\n\n7.0\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\n20000\n\n25000\n\n30000\n\n35000\n\nPeriod T (hr)\n\nh (km)     a/R\n\n23.93\n\nFig. 5.2 :Keplerian period of a satellite as a function of the semi-major axis a (and\n\nthe altitude for a circular orbit).

The frame is the\nGalilean frame ?. The satellite is moving in a direct or prograde orbit. The\ntrajectory shown begins on the vertical axis, on which the values of ? = a/R\nare indicated, and ends at a black dot. For ? = 1.0, the trajectory makes a\ncomplete round trip, for ? = 1.6, just half a revolution, and for ? = 2.5, one\nquarter of a revolution (since 1.6?3/2 ? 1/2 and 2.5?3/2 ? 1/4).\n\nConsider now the lower graph of Fig. 5.3, representing the Earth\u2019s equa-\ntorial plane.

For ? = 6.6, an equatorial satellite revolves at\nthe same angular speed as the Earth in the frame ?. In a terrestrial frame ?T\nfixed with respect to the Earth, this satellite will appear to be motionless. It\nis said to be geostationary. We shall return to this case in Chap. 7.\n\n5.4 Appendix: Rotation of a Solid\u2014Euler\n\nand Cardan Angles\n\nThe rotation of a rigid solid can be defined as the transformation from\none Cartesian frame to another. It can be shown that this transformation can\nbe decomposed into three elementary rotations, in a well defined order, about\nthe coordinate axes.\n\nThe three axes Ox, Oy, and Oz are labelled 1, 2, and 3. The rotation R\ndecomposes into three successive rotations through angles ?1, ?2, and ?3 :\n\n\u2022 Ri(?1): rotation through ?1 about axis i, with i = 1, 2, or 3.\n\u2022 Rj(?2): rotation through ?2 about axis j, with j = 1, 2, or 3, and j ?= i.\n\u2022 Rk(?3): rotation through ?3 about axis k, with k = 1, 2, or 3, k ?= j.\n\nUsing ? to denote compositions of transformations, we thus have\n\nR = Rk(?3) ? Rj(?2) ? Ri(?1) . (5.11)\n\nThere are therefore 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 12 ways to carry out this composition. In\npractice, only two of these are actually used: the Euler3 system (Fig. 5.4) and\nthe Cardan4 system (see Table 5.2).\n\n3Leonhard Euler (1707\u20131783) was a prolific Swiss mathematician whose work ranged\nover all the mathematics of the day. He was the first to develop the idea of a function of a\nvariable, usually denoted f(x), applying it to exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric\nfunctions in his Introduction in analysis infinitorum (1748). He introduced the notation e,\n?, and i, and obtained the celebrated result\n\nei? + 1 = 0 .\n\nHe also invented graph theory, applying it to solve (negatively) the problem of the seven\nbridges of Ko?nigsberg, and worked on convex polyhedra, showing that there are exactly five\nPlatonic solids.\n\nIn mechanics, and in particular in his Mechanica sive motus scientia analytica exposita\n(1736), he analysed the motion of a material point using Euler angles and Euler variables.\nHis clear expositions revolutionised algebra, geometry, and number theory.\n\nIn astronomy, he studied the mutual perturbations of Saturn and Jupiter in Theoria\nmotuum planetarium et cometarum (1744), the precession of the equinoxes (1749), the\nrestricted three-body problem, and the motion of the Moon (1772).\n\n4Gerolamo Cardano (1501\u20131576), known in English as Jerome Cardan, was an Italian\nmathematician. He found a way of solving third order polynomial equations. He invented\na mechanical device, the Cardan suspension, that could make a compass insensitive to a\nship\u2019s motion. The names of the Cardan angles, roll, pitch, and yaw, are borrowed from\nnaval vocabulary. Doctor, astrologer, and generally unusual character, Cardan is said to\nhave stopped eating so that he could die on the day he had predicted using his horoscope!\n\n\n\n160 Chapter 5.

The decomposition\nis illustrated in Fig. 5.1:\n\n\u2022 The first rotation Ri(?1), with i = 3, is made around the Oz axis to\ntransform Ox to ON0. The angle ?1 is the angle of precession, ?1 = ?.\n\n\u2022 The second rotation Rj(?2), with j = 1, is made around the Ox axis, now\nrepresented by ON0, to transform Oz to OZ. The angle ?2 is the angle of\nnutation, the angle i between the two planes.\n\n\u2022 The third rotation Rk(?3), with k = 3, is made around the Oz axis, now\nrepresented by OZ, to transform ON0 to OP0. The angle ?3 is the angle\nof proper rotation, ?3 = ?.\n\nFor this system, the given rotation is uniquely defined by\n\n0 ? ?1 < 2? , 0 ? ?2 ? ? , 0 ? ?3 < 2? .\n\nReplacing P0 by S0 and hence ?3 = ? by ?3 = ? + v, we see that this\ndecomposition is well suited to studying the orbital motion of a satellite. The\nrotation matrix corresponding to R is obtained as the product of three simple\nmatrices.\n\nCardan Angles\n\nWhen the satellite is no longer treated as a point, but rather as a complex\ntechnological object carrying emitting and receiving instruments, solar panels,\nand so on, it is also important to control its attitude, i.e., its orientation in the\n\n\n\n5.4 Appendix: Rotation of a Solid\u2014Euler and Cardan Angles 161\n\nspace around its center of gravity. The Cardan system is then highly suited.\nIt corresponds to the sequence [1, 2, 3].\n\nThe three Cardan angles are called roll, pitch, and yaw. They depend on\nthe choice of axes relative to the line of sight from the Earth to the satellite.\nWe shall return to these angles in Chap. 12, which discusses what can be\nviewed from the satellite.\n\nNote on Other Naming Systems. In this book, we use the term Euler\nangles to distinguish from the Cardan angles. In the literature, the Euler\nangles are also known as the Tait\u2013Bryan angles. In some references, the term\nEuler angles may refer to any set of three angles (denoted here by ?1, ?2, ?3)\nused to decompose rotations.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nSatellite in Real (Perturbed)\n\nOrbit\n6.1 Perturbing Forces\n\n6.1.1 From Ideal to Real Orbits\n\nUp to now, we have been discussing the Keplerian motion of an Earth-\norbiting satellite: this satellite is pointlike and subject to the gravitational\nattraction of a pointlike Earth. It has a fixed orbit in a fixed plane, and\nthis remains immutable relative to a Galilean frame. We have seen that the\nEarth\u2019s attraction reduces to the attraction due to a point mass, provided\nthat the Earth can be treated as spherical, with a spherically symmetric mass\ndistribution (conditions for applying Gauss\u2019 theorem).\n\nBut when we observe the motion of a satellite with sufficient accuracy,\nwe find that it does not follow exactly this kind of Keplerian motion. The\ndifference is only very slight over one revolution, but increases steadily as\ntime goes by until it becomes easily discernible after a few days. One might\nsay that the Keplerian orbit is gradually distorted.\n\nThe difference between the true motion and the ideal Keplerian motion\nresults from two considerations, as we have already mentioned:\n\n\u2022 The Earth is not exactly spherical and the mass distribution is not exactly\nspherically symmetric.\n\n\u2022 The satellite feels other forces apart from the Earth\u2019s attraction, such as at-\ntractive forces due to other heavenly bodies and forces that can be globally\ncategorised as frictional.\n\nThe effects of these perturbations will be the subject of this chapter.\n\nM. Capderou, Handbook of Satellite Orbits: From Kepler to GPS,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-03416-4 6,\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014\n\n163\n\n\n\n164 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\n6.1.2 Order of Magnitude of Perturbing Forces\n\nThe forces felt by a satellite in geocentric orbit are examined below as\na function of the altitude of the satellite and summed up in Fig. 6.1. From\na physical standpoint, it is useful to divide these forces into two categories,\ndepending on whether or not they are conservative.\n\nConservative forces are ones that can be derived from a potential, e.g.,\ngravitational forces such as the gravitational attraction of the Earth and at-\ntraction to other heavenly bodies. Non-conservative forces are forces that can-\nnot be derived from a potential, i.e., dissipative forces involving energy loss.\nApart from atmospheric drag, which falls off very rapidly with increasing al-\ntitude, the relevant forces here are due to radiation pressure.\n\nIt is important to assess the orders of magnitude of the various forces.\nFor example, for a satellite at an altitude of 800 km in a near-circular orbit,\ntaking the central attraction to be unity, the other attractive effects have the\nfollowing much lower values:\n\n\u2022 10?3 for the perturbation due to the flattening of the Earth,\n\u2022 10?6 for perturbations due to other irregularities of the geoid,\n\u2022 10?7 for the attraction of the Moon,\n\u2022 10?8 for the attraction of the Sun.\n\nThe other forces, conservative or otherwise, generally never exceed order 10?8.\nThese are orders of magnitude, to which we shall return later on. However,\n\nwe can already see that all these forces (except the main one) can be treated\nas perturbations. They are not dealt with together in one global treatment,\nbut one by one, as quantities that remain small relative to the main force,\nwhich is the central Newtonian attraction.\n\nThe set of forces mentioned above can be written in terms of the acceler-\nations:\n\n? = ?CCC + ?CCN +\n?\ni\n\n?Ci +\n?\nj\n\n?Dj , (6.1)\n\nusing the suffixes explained in Table 6.1. The leading term is ?CCC, compared\nwith which all the others are very small. Naturally, we have the equivalence\n\n?CCC = g(r) = ?\n?\n\nr2\ner , (6.2)\n\nwhere the vector field g(r) represents the Newtonian gravitational field of the\nEarth, previously defined in (3.11).\n\n6.1.3 Potential\n\nTo begin with, let us consider only those terms due to conservative forces\nso that we may use the idea of potential. We know that the potential U\nassociated with a vector field ? is given by\n\n\n\n6.1 Perturbing Forces 165\n\n? = gradU ,\n\nand using the linearity properties of the gradient operator grad, we have\n\nU = UCCC + UCCN +\n?\ni\n\nUCi . (6.3)\n\nThe Earth\u2019s gravitational potential is\n\nUCC = UCCC + UCCN .\n\nWe calculated this in Chap. 3, obtaining the general form (3.28) and the trun-\ncated form (3.27), cutting off after degree 2.\n\nThe leading order term UCCC, hereafter written U0, corresponds to the\n\u201cKeplerian\u201d central attraction, viz.,\n\nUCCC = U0 =\n?\n\nr\n=\n\nGM\n\nr\n. (6.4)\n\n6.1.4 Perturbations and Altitude of a Satellite\n\nLet us now investigate the whole range of perturbative forces (accelera-\ntions) affecting a satellite S at distance r from the center O of the Earth. We\nmay also express them in terms of h, the altitude of the satellite, given by\nh = r ? R, where R is the equatorial radius of the Earth. Figure 6.1 shows\nthe value of the acceleration ? as a function of the reduced distance ? = r/R,\nusing a log\u2013log scale:\n\n\u2022 On the horizontal axis x = log ?, with minimal value x = 0, i.e., r = R or\nh = 0, corresponding to ground level.\n\n\u2022 On the vertical axis, y = log ?i, where ?i is the acceleration under consid-\neration.\n\nThe figure shows typical altitudes of three types of satellite (we shall discuss\nthese types in more detail later):\n\n\u2022 h = 1,000km for satellites in low orbit (LEO),\n\u2022 h = 20,000 km for positioning satellites (MEO),\n\u2022 h = 36,000 km for geostationary satellites (GEO).\n\nThe figure shows the sensitivity of the different types of satellite to the various\nperturbing forces depending on their altitudes. The forces, divided into con-\nservative and non-conservative (or dissipative), are summarised in Table 6.1.\n\nConservative Forces\n\nThe gravitational forces acting on the satellite come from the following\nsources:\n\n\n\n166 Chapter 6.

The central acceleration, denoted here by\n?CCC, is given by (6.2), viz.,\n\n?CCC(r) = g(r) =\n?\n\nr2\n. (6.5)\n\nIt is thus represented by a straight line of slope p = ?2 in a graph using\na log\u2013log scale, since we have y = log(?/R2) ? 2x. The value at the origin\n(x = 0, i.e., r = R or h = 0) is\n\n?CCC(R) = g(R) = g0 =\n?\n\nR2\n, (6.6)\n\nwith average numerical value\n\ng0 = 9.80 m s\n?2 .\n\nConcerning the J2 term, the potential UCCN.J2 given by (3.27) goes as r\n?3.\n\nThe corresponding acceleration ?CCN.J2 thus goes as r\n?4, whence the slope\n\np = ?4 of the straight line representing it on the log\u2013log graph. As value at\nthe origin (h = 0), we have taken\n\n?CCN.J2(R) = g0J2 ,\n\nwhich is an average value over the latitudes frequented by the satellite.\nThe acceleration ?CCN.JN for the terms Jn with n > 2 leads to an even\n\nsteeper slope. We shall see below that only those terms Jn with even n have\nany long-term (secular) influence on the satellite. Equation (3.28) shows that\nthe potential goes as r?(n+1), and the acceleration therefore as r?(n+2). The\nslope is p = ?6 for J4, p = ?8 for J6, and so on. At the origin, the numerical\nvalues are\n\n\n\n168 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\ng0J2 = 1.1\u00d7 10?2 ms?2 ,\n\ng0J4 = 1.6\u00d7 10?5 ms?2 , g0J6 = 5.3\u00d7 10?6 ms?2 ,\n\nwhere we have of course taken the absolute values of the terms Jn.\n\n(b) Attraction by the Sun and Moon. We consider an attracting body\n(the Sun or Moon) and calculate its action on the satellite. As the Earth also\nfeels an attraction from the same source, we must calculate the differential\nattraction felt by the satellite in a coordinate system fixed relative to the\ncenter of the Earth.\n\nThe differential attraction due to the Sun produces the acceleration ?CS\n(calculated in Sect. 6.11 at the end of the chapter). Equation (6.151) yields\n\n?CS = 2\n?S\na3S\n\nr , (6.7)\n\nwhere ?S is the heliocentric gravitational constant and aS is the Earth\u2013Sun\ndistance, i.e., the semi-major axis of the Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun.\n\nFor the differential attraction due to the Moon, the acceleration ?CL can\nbe calculated to a first approximation by a similar argument:\n\n?CL = 2\n?L\na3L\n\nr , (6.8)\n\nwhere ?L is the lunar gravitational constant and aL is the Earth\u2013Moon dis-\ntance, i.e., the semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit.\n\nFor the range of values represented here, ?CS and ?CL are proportional\nto r, so that their variation has slope p = +1. At the origin (h = 0), numerical\nvalues are\n\n?CS(R) = 2\n?S\na3S\n\nR = 0.5\u00d710?6 ms?2 , ?CL(R) = 2\n?L\na3L\n\nR = 1.1\u00d710?6 ms?2 .\n\nThe effect of the Moon is more than twice that of the Sun.1\n\n(c) Attraction by Other Planets. This differential attraction causes a very\nsmall acceleration of the satellite, denoted ?CP, also of slope p = +1. For each\nplanet, the order of magnitude is given by\n\n?CP = 2\n?P\na3P\n\nr , (6.9)\n\n1There is a trick for obtaining a relation between the two accelerations ?CS(r) and\n?CL(r). Their ratio is\n\n?CL(r)\n\n?CS(r)\n=\n\n?L\n\n?S\n\n(\naS\n\naL\n\n)3\n.\n\n\n\n6.1 Perturbing Forces 169\n\nwhere ?P is the gravitational attraction of the planet and aP is the Earth\u2013\nplanet distance. Depending on the configuration of the planets, the maximal\nperturbative accelerations are\n\n?CP ? 10?10 ms?2 due to Venus , ?CP ? 10?11 ms?2 due to Jupiter .\n\n(d) Tidal Effects. The ocean tides are caused by the perturbing effects of the\nSun and Moon. This idea was first put forward by Newton, then Bernoulli, and\nthe theory was completed by Laplace and Kelvin. The phenomenon is familiar\nto us and easy to observe. It is less well known that this same perturbation\nalso affects the Earth\u2019s crust: twice a day, the Earth\u2019s solid envelope rises\nand falls with an amplitude of around three decimeters (and six for the liquid\nenvelope, i.e., the oceans).\n\nBoth ocean and land tides involve friction, so this phenomenon is not\nconservative. Indeed, this effect explains the gradual reduction of the Earth\u2019s\nrotation. However, the effect of the tides on a satellite can be found using the\nfact that the relevant stresses derive from a potential. It can be shown that\nthe interaction potential goes as r?3, giving rise to an acceleration that goes\nas r?4. For r = R, we have ?CT ? 5 \u00d7 10?7 ms?2. The effect of the ocean\ntides is roughly one tenth of the effect of the land tides.\n\n(e) Relativistic Effects. The speed V of a satellite never exceeds a few\nkilometers a second. This is very small compared with the speed of light\nc and a relativistic treatment is generally unnecessary. However, since the\nTOPEX/Poseidon mission, relativistic effects have been taken into account\nfor altimetry and positioning (GPS-type) satellites. It can be shown that the\ncorrection amounts to considering a so-called relativistic acceleration, whose\nleading term is ?CR given by\n\n?CR =\n?\n\nr2\n3V 2\n\nc2\n. (6.10)\n\nNow we know from solar eclipses that the apparent diameters of the Sun and Earth are\nequal as viewed from the Earth. We thus have the relation\n\nRL\n\naL\n=\n\nRS\n\naS\n,\n\nwhere RL and RS are the respective radii. Expressing the masses through the densities ?L\nand ?S, we obtain\n\n?L\n\n?S\n=\n\n?L\n\n?S\n\n(\nRL\n\nRS\n\n)3\n,\n\nwhence, inserting the numerical values, we determine the value of the ratio as\n\n?CL(r)\n\n?CS(r)\n=\n\n?L\n\n?S\n=\n\n3.3437\n\n1.4808\n? 2.25 .\n\n\n\n170 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nFor a circular orbit, with (4.52), we obtain\n\n?CR =\n3?2\n\nc2\n1\n\nr3\n, (6.11)\n\ngiving a slope of p = ?3.\nAt the origin (h = 0), we have\n\n?CR(R) = g0\n3?\n\nc2R\n= 1.6\u00d7 10?8 ms?2 ,\n\nThe main consequence of this is a secular effect on the argument of the perigee,\nnamely that the perigee of the orbit moves around more quickly than classical\ncalculations would suggest. Indeed the effect is known as the advance of the\nperigee or the precession of the perigee.2 For planets in orbit around the Sun,\nwe speak of the advance or the precession of the perihelion, a phenomenon\nfirst explained by Albert Einstein (see the historical note in Sect. 6.8.3 at the\nend of the chapter).\n\nCalculations of this apsidal precession give a variation ?1? in the argu-\nment of the perigee ? for each revolution, where\n\n?1? =\n6??\n\na(1? e2)c2 . (6.12)\n\nThe subscript 1 indicates that the value corresponds to one revolution, while a\nsubscript Y is used for the value obtained over 1 year. This value is very small\n(a fraction of an arcmin per year), whether the satellite is in near-circular or\neccentric orbit:\n\n\u2022 SPOT-5 (a = 7.20\u00d7 106m), ?1? = 1.16\u00d7 10?8 rad, ?Y? = 12??.4.\n\u2022 TOPEX/Poseidon (a = 7.71 \u00d7 106m), ?1? = 1.08 \u00d7 10?8 rad, ?Y? =\n\n10??.5.\n\u2022 Navstar/GPS (a = 26.56\u00d7 106 m), ?1? = 3.15\u00d7 10?9 rad, ?Y? = 0??.48.\n\u2022 Molniya (a = 26.56 \u00d7 106m, e = 0.74), ?1? = 6.89 \u00d7 10?9 rad, ?Y? =\n\n1??.04.\n\nThe force bringing about the advance of the perigee should be considered as\nconservative, since the same effect can be obtained by including a small time-\nindependent and hence conservative quadrupole moment going as r?3 in the\ngravitational force.\n\n2According to the general theory of relativity, the Earth\u2019s gravitational field affects\nspacetime in the vicinity of the satellite, whose trajectory thus differs slightly from the one\ncalculated using classical celestial mechanics. This action can be represented by a \u201crelativis-\ntic acceleration\u201d. It can be shown that it decomposes into three terms: the Schwarzschild\nterm, the geodetic precession, and the Lense\u2013Thirring precession. The first is the greater\nof the three, providing the acceleration ?CR discussed here. The other two are considered\nwhen we discuss the satellite GP-B in Chap. 7.\n\n\n\n6.2 Perturbative Methods: Presentation 171\n\nNon-Conservative Forces\n\nNon-gravitational perturbing forces are independent of the satellite mass\nMs. The corresponding accelerations thus go as 1/Ms. Along with the forces\ndiscussed below, one must include forces applied to the satellite (usually by\ngas jets) when modifying its trajectory. These are the non-conservative forces\nused to guide the satellite.\n\n(a) Atmospheric Drag. For satellites in low orbit (h < 1,200km), fric-\ntion with molecules of residual atmospheric gases can be quite significant.\nThis effect depends on the shape of the satellite, and in particular the shape\nof its solar panels, but also on the state of the upper atmosphere, which is\ndifficult to model theoretically, because it involves several factors, including\nsolar activity. These effects are further discussed in an appendix at the end\nof the chapter (see Sect. 6.6). Atmospheric effects become very weak above\nh = 1,000km and fall off very quickly with altitude. Hence, they are very\nslight for TOPEX/Poseidon at an altitude of 1,300km, and non-existent for\nLAGEOS at 6,000km.\n\n(b) Radiation Pressure. Solar radiation pressure goes as a?2S , and so is\nindependent of r (since r ? aS). The actual consequences of this radiation\npressure on the satellite depend on its shape, coating materials, and configura-\ntion.3 These go to zero when the satellite passes into the Earth\u2019s shadow with\nrespect to the Sun. The corresponding perturbative acceleration is evaluated\nto be\n\n?DP(r) = ?DP = constant ? 10?7 ms?2 .\n\n(c) Albedo Effect. The effects of scattered radiation, i.e., visible (short\nwavelength) radiation scattered by the Earth, known as the albedo effect,\nand infrared (long wavelength) radiation emitted by the Earth, depend on\nthe region overflown and the altitude. These effects can be considered to go\nas r?2.\n\n6.2 Perturbative Methods: Presentation\n\n6.2.1 Orbit Propagation: Numerical and Analytical\nMethods\n\nIn this chapter, we have been concerned so far with perturbations which\nrepresent the difference between the Newtonian potential and the true poten-\n\n3This perturbative effect was quite large for the first balloon satellites, such as Echo-1,\nlaunched in 1960, Echo-2 in 1964, and PAGEOS in 1966. These very light satellites, com-\nprising an aluminised mylar envelope just 13 ?m thick, blown up after the launch, had a\ndiameter of 30\u201340m.\n\n\n\n172 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\ntial. We shall now see how this difference of potential can lead to a deviation\nin the satellite motion. The term \u201corbit determination\u201d refers to any method\nfor establishing the trajectory of a satellite given its force field and initial\nposition.\n\nSuch methods are classified according to whether integration of the equa-\ntion of motion is numerical or analytic. The first method provides series of\nnumbers. It is efficient but not particularly intuitive. The second expresses\nmodifications of the motion in a clear and pictorial way, e.g., one could say\nwhether the eccentricity increases, or the orbit begins to precess, and so on.\n\nAnother contrast is that the numerical method is long-winded but highly\naccurate, while the analytic method is faster but does not always achieve the\nsame accuracy. When dealing with an orbital rendezvous, or trying to avoid\ncollisions between satellites, the first method prevails, while the analytical\nmethod is quite adequate for standard orbitography. The Ixion software and\nall the programs discussed in this book are based upon the analytical method.\nWe shall outline the basic principles underlying each method. However, we\nshall only go into the details of the analytical method, using the Lagrangian\napproach.\n\nWhen the satellite is subjected to the sum of the Newtonian central ac-\nceleration and a perturbative acceleration, since we take the perturbation to\nbe small, we may assume that the trajectory will remain rather close to the\nconic section:\n\nr? = gradU0 + ?P , U0 =\n?\n\nr\n. (6.13)\n\nHere ?P is the perturbation term, assumed much smaller than the main term,\ni.e.,\n\n?P ?\n?\n\nr2\n.\n\nWe shall only consider perturbative accelerations deriving from a potential,\nin which case we have\n\n?P = gradR ,\n\nwith R the perturbing potential. The satellite is thus affected by the potential\n\nU = U0 +R . (6.14)\n\nNumerical Method\n\nThe relevant system of equations is:\n\n{\nr? = ?? r\n\nr3\n+ ?P ,\n\nr(t = 0) = r0 , r?(t = 0) = r?0 .\n(6.15)\n\n\n\n6.2 Perturbative Methods: Presentation 173\n\nThese are integrated by successive construction of the orbital elements. The\nso-called k-step method determines the elements at times t = tn+1 using the\nk elements obtained previously. For example, when k = 1, the integration\nbetween times t = t0 and t = tN is done in one step h = (tN ? t0)/N . At time\ntn+1, each Cartesian coordinate y is expressed in terms of the value of y at\ntime tn :\n\ny(tn+1) = y(tn + h) = y(tn) + h? .\n\nWith the Euler method, ? is the derivative y?(tn). Better suited and more\nelaborate methods have been developed:\n\n\u2022 Purely mathematical approaches, such as Runge\u2013Kutta integration, intro-\nduced at the end of the nineteenth century, where the function ?, in its\nmost standard form, is just a fourth order Taylor expansion.\n\n\u2022 Methods developed by astronomers to determine the motions of planets and\nother heavenly bodies, e.g., Adams\u2013Bashforth or Adams\u2013Moulton, known\nas multistep methods.\n\n\u2022 Approaches designed specifically for artificial satellites since 1957, such as\nthe Cowell method.\n\nAnalytical Method\n\nWe showed previously that Keplerian motion of a satellite is specified by\nsix orbital elements, the Keplerian elements. It can be shown that there is\na bijective correspondence B between the six elements and the six Cartesian\ncomponents of the vectors r and r? in a Galilean frame ? :{\n\nx(t), y(t), z(t), x?(t), y?(t), z?(t)\n} B??? {a(t), e(t), i(t), ?(t), ?(t),M(t)} .\n\nIn Keplerian motion, the five parameters (a, e, i, ?, ?) fixing the position of\nthe orbit remain constant, while M varies linearly, i.e., M = n(t? tp), where\ntp is the time of perigee passage. For perturbed motion, investigation of the\ntransformation B shows that (6.13) is equivalent to the 6 relations:{\n\na? = g1 , e? = g2 , i? = g3 ,\n\n?? = g4 , ?? = g5 , M? ? n0 = g6 ,\n(6.16)\n\nwhere n0 =\n?\n?/a30 and a0 is for the time being the value of a without per-\n\nturbation. The terms gi are small.\nA standard approach is to use an iterative method at this point. The\n\ntime-varying parameters are called osculating orbital elements. They are the\nparameters of the Keplerian orbit that the satellite would follow if the per-\nturbations were to suddenly vanish at the given instant. These osculating\nelements4 provide a better way of describing the deformation of the orbit than\n\n4The word \u201cosculating\u201d does not mean the same thing here as in geometry. In the purely\ngeometrical context, two curves are said to be osculating if their two centers of curvature\n\n\n\n174 Chapter 6.

As an example, this method allows one\nto establish the critical inclination of the orbit, as we shall see later.\n\nThe perturbation method consists in solving the six equations above,\nknown as Lagrange\u2019s equations (see Fig. 6.2).5\n\n6.2.2 Basic Principles\n\nThe actual motion is obtained by calculating the small variations around\nthe first integrals of the unperturbed motion. For a perturbative acceleration\nfield deriving from a potential, (6.13) and (6.14) give the equation of motion as\n\nr? = gradU , U = U0 +R . (6.17)\n\nTranscribing this for each Cartesian component of r, we have\n\nd2x\n\ndt2\n=\n\n?U\n\n?x\n,\n\nd2y\n\ndt2\n=\n\n?U\n\n?y\n,\n\nd2z\n\ndt2\n=\n\n?U\n\n?z\n.\n\nWe now write down the results for x. The first of the above equations yields\n\nx? =\ndx\n\ndt\n, (6.18)\n\ndx?\n\ndt\n=\n\n?U\n\n?x\n. (6.19)\n\nBringing in the 6 Keplerian orbital elements (or any 6 suitably chosen vari-\nables), we obtain x? as a sum of 6 terms, and hence x? as a sum of 36 terms.\n\ncoincide for some point of contact between them. In the present context, in the investigation\nof trajectories in space, the osculating ellipse defined by the osculating orbital elements is\ntangent to the actual trajectory, since the velocity vector is the same, but it does not have\nexactly the same radius of curvature, since the accelerations are different. The term was\noriginally invented by geometers in 1752 and then slightly deflected from its geometrical\nmeaning by the needs of astronomy. The etymology of the word attests to this corruption.\nIndeed, it comes from the Latin osculatio, the noun from the verb osculare, meaning \u201cto\nkiss\u201d. This in turn derives from osculum, \u201clittle mouth\u201d, a diminutive form of os, oris,\nwhich is the standard term for \u201cmouth\u201d. The idea which therefore underpins this term is\ntherefore one of extended and continued contact.\n\n5Joseph Louis de Lagrange (1736\u20131813) was a French mathematician. He applied his\nanalytical theories to the motion of the Moon and the periodic variation of the major axes\nof the planets, published in The?orie de la libration de la Lune et autres phe?nome?nes qui\nde?pendent de la figure non sphe?rique de cette plane?te (1763), and he also invented the notion\nof gravitational potential in 1772. All these ideas were brought together in his magnum opus\nMe?canique analytique (1788). He invented the theory of perturbations to study the motion\nof the heavenly bodies, published in Sur la the?orie des variations des e?le?ments des plane?tes\n(1808). He also continued Euler\u2019s work, devising a final version of the method known as\nvariation of constants, published in Sur la the?orie ge?ne?rale de la variation des constantes\narbitraires dans tous les proble?mes de me?canique (1810). His name is still associated with\nthe equations and mathematical tools used in these theories.\n\n\n\n6.2 Perturbative Methods: Presentation 175\n\nFig. 6.2 :Me?canique analytique by J.L.

And\n\njust to demonstrate the abstract nature of the treatise, he adds: \u201cthe reader will find\n\nno figures in this work.\u201d\n\n\n\n176 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nThe perturbation method solves the differential equations by the method\nknown as variation of constants. The choice of certain variables, called canon-\nical variables, allows us to obtain Lagrange\u2019s equations in a very simple form,\nthe canonical form, as the relations (6.60). Several sets of six variables offer\nthis possibility, such as the Delaunay variables, the Poincare? variables, or the\nWhittaker (or Hill) variables.\n\nMore will be said about the Delaunay variables later, but for the moment,\nlet us not enter into the details of these powerful mathematical theories, de-\nveloped principally to calculate planetary orbits, and to which we now attach\nthe names of Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, Gauss, and Poincare?.\n\n6.2.3 Lagrange Brackets\n\nWe denote the Cartesian coordinates by ?i, with i = 1, 2, 3:\n\n?1 = x , ?2 = y , ?3 = z .\n\nThe equation of motion (6.17) is\n\n??i =\n?U\n\n??i\n. (6.20)\n\nThe Keplerian orbital elements are denoted by Sj , with j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6:\n\nS1 = a , S2 = e , S3 = i , S4 = ? , S5 = ? , S6 = ? .\n\nThe element S6 is the initial mean anomaly. It is introduced here instead of\nM in order to have M? ? n appear directly in (6.16). We have the very simple\nrelation\n\n? = M ? nt = ?ntp , (6.21)\n\nwhere tp is the time of passage at perigee.

(6.23)\n\nMultiplying the three equations (6.22) by ????i/?Sk and the three equa-\ntions (6.23) by ??i/?Sk and adding, we obtain the system\n\n3?\ni=1\n\n6?\nj=1\n\n(\n? ???i\n?Sk\n\n??i\n?Sj\n\n+\n??i\n?Sk\n\n???i\n?Sj\n\n)\ndSj\ndt\n\n=\n\n3?\ni=1\n\n(\n? ???i\n?Sk\n\n??i +\n??i\n?Sk\n\n?U\n\n??i\n\n)\n,\n\n(6.24)\n\n\n\n6.2 Perturbative Methods: Presentation 177\n\nfor k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This system is equivalent to (6.13), which represent the\nproblem we are trying to solve. Let us examine the two sides of the equality.\n\nRegarding the left-hand side, we use the following notation. We set\n\n[Sk;Sj] =\n\n3?\ni=1\n\n(\n??i\n?Sk\n\n???i\n?Sj\n\n? ???i\n?Sk\n\n??i\n?Sj\n\n)\n. (6.25)\n\nThe notation [Sk;Sj ] is the Lagrange bracket. We thus have 36 Lagrange\nbrackets.\n\nThe right-hand side comprises two terms. The first can be written\n\n?\n3?\n\ni=1\n\n???i\n?Sk\n\n??i = ?\n1\n\n2\n\n3?\ni=1\n\n???i\n2\n\n?Sk\n= ?1\n\n2\n\n?\n\n?Sk\n\n3?\ni=1\n\n??i\n2\n.\n\nAt this point, the quantity T appears, with the dimensions of a potential and\nrepresenting the kinetic energy per unit mass:\n\nT =\n1\n\n2\n\n3?\ni=1\n\n??i\n2\n=\n\n1\n\n2\nV 2 , (6.26)\n\nwhere V is the magnitude of the velocity at the given point. The first term\ncan then be written in the form\n\n? ?T\n?Sk\n\n. (6.27)\n\nThe second term transforms to\n\n3?\ni=1\n\n?U\n\n??i\n\n??i\n?Sk\n\n=\n?U\n\n?Sk\n. (6.28)\n\nIf we set\n\nF = U ? T , (6.29)\n\nthe system (6.24), and hence also (6.13), is equivalent to\n\n6?\nj=1\n\n[Sk;Sj ]\ndSj\ndt\n\n=\n?F\n\n?Sk\n, k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 . (6.30)\n\nThis quantity F has dimensions of energy per unit mass. It is sometimes called\nthe force function or the Hamiltonian function, since it is equal to minus the\nHamiltonian (see Sect. 4.7).6\n\n6If we compare the Eqs. (4.111) and (6.29) giving the energy, we note that, with the\nnotation used here and m for the mass of the satellite, we have\n\n\n\n178 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\n6.2.4 Properties of the Lagrange Bracket\n\nAntisymmetry\n\nFrom the definition (6.25), it is clear by inspection that\n\n[Sk;Sk] = 0 , [Sk;Sj] = ?[Sj ;Sk] .\n\nWe deduce that, of the 36 brackets, 6 are zero and among the 30 remaining\nwhich may not be zero, only 15 need be calculated.\n\nConstancy of Lagrange Bracket in Time\n\nThe Lagrange bracket is defined by (6.25) as the sum of three terms. To\ncalculate the time derivative of a Lagrange bracket, we begin with just one\nelement of the sum, the i th element. This gives\n\nd\n\ndt\n([Sk;Sj ]i) =\n\nd\n\ndt\n\n(\n??i\n?Sk\n\n???i\n?Sj\n\n? ???i\n?Sk\n\n??i\n?Sj\n\n)\n\n=\n???i\n?Sk\n\n???i\n?Sj\n\n+\n??i\n?Sk\n\n???i\n?Sj\n\n? ???i\n?Sk\n\n??i\n?Sj\n\n? ???i\n?Sk\n\n???i\n?Sj\n\n=\n??i\n?Sk\n\n???i\n?Sj\n\n? ???i\n?Sk\n\n??i\n?Sj\n\n. (6.31)\n\nTo obtain a more symmetrical form that will allow some simplification later\non, it is useful to add and subtract the expression\n\n??i\n?2??i\n\n?Sk?Sj\n+ ??i\n\n?2?i\n?Sk?Sj\n\n. (6.32)\n\nWe then obtain\n\nd\n\ndt\n([Sk;Sj ]i) =\n\n?\n\n?Sk\n\n(\n??i\n???i\n?Sj\n\n? ??i\n??i\n?Sj\n\n)\n? ?\n\n?Sj\n\n(\n??i\n\n???i\n?Sk\n\n? ??i\n??i\n?Sk\n\n)\n\n=\n?\n\n?Sk\n\n(\n??i\n???i\n?Sj\n\n? ?U\n??i\n\n??i\n?Sj\n\n)\n? ?\n\n?Sj\n\n(\n??i\n\n???i\n?Sk\n\n? ?U\n??i\n\n??i\n?Sk\n\n)\n,\n\nU = ?mU , T = +mT , E = T + U = ?m(U ? T ) = ?mF\n\n=? ?E/m = F = U ? T .\n\nWhen studying orbits and space trajectories, it is preferable to use accelerations rather\nthan forces, and the potential U rather than the potential energy ?U , since the mass of\nthe satellite is irrelevant to these calculations (except in the case of atmospheric drag and\nradiation pressure effects). Moreover, we have seen that the energy E is negative for periodic\nmotion. The convention for F means that this quantity has positive values.\n\n\n\n6.3 Perturbative Method: Solution 179\n\nwhere the last equality is obtained using the fundamental relation (6.20). We\nnow sum over the three values of i, taking the partial derivatives with respect\nto Sj and Sk outside the sum and using the relations (6.26) for T , (6.28) for\nthe derivative of T , and (6.29) for F , to obtain\n\nd\n\ndt\n[Sk;Sj] =\n\n?\n\n?Sk\n\n[\n3?\n\ni=1\n\n(\n??i\n???i\n?Sj\n\n? ?U\n??i\n\n??i\n?Sj\n\n)]\n\n? ?\n?Sj\n\n[\n3?\n\ni=1\n\n(\n??i\n\n???i\n?Sk\n\n? ?U\n??i\n\n??i\n?Sk\n\n)]\n\n=\n?\n\n?Sk\n\n(\n?T\n\n?Sj\n? ?U\n\n?Sj\n\n)\n? ?\n\n?Sj\n\n(\n?T\n\n?Sk\n? ?U\n\n?Sk\n\n)\n\n=\n?2F\n\n?Sk?Sj\n? ?\n\n2F\n\n?Sj?Sk\n= 0 .\n\nThe equation\n\nd\n\ndt\n[Sk;Sj ] = 0 (6.33)\n\nshows finally that the expression [Sk;Sj] is constant in time. The value of the\nbracket can of course change in time if one or more of the orbital parameters\nare time dependent. However, during one revolution, we may consider the\nparameters Si to be constant and [Sk;Sj ] thus remains constant too. This\nmeans that, in order to obtain its value, we can do so at a single point on the\norbit.\n\n6.3 Perturbative Method: Solution\n\n6.3.1 Calculating the Coordinates\n\nCoordinates in the Orbital Plane\n\nTo calculate the factors ???i/?Sk and ??i/?Sj in the Lagrange brackets,\nwe express the Cartesian coordinates in terms of the parameters. To do so,\nwe write the position of the satellite in a right-handed orthonormal frame\n(O;X,Y, Z) fixed relative to the plane P of the orbit, where O is the center\nof attraction, i.e., the center of the Earth. The plane P contains OX and\nOY , while OX passes through the perigee P and OZ is perpendicular to P\nand lies in the direction of the angular momentum C of the satellite. In this\nframe, we may write the components X,Y, Z, of the radial vector using (4.70)\nand (4.71):\n\n\n\n180 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nX = r cos v = a(cosE ? e) ,\nY = r sin v = a\n\n?\n1? e2 sinE ,\n\nZ = 0 .\n\nWe recall that the eccentric anomaly E arising in these formulas is related to\nthe mean anomaly M , used as orbital element, by Kepler\u2019s equation (4.65).\nDifferentiating with respect to time, we obtain\n\n(1? e cosE)de\ndt\n\n= n =\n\n?\n?\n\na3\n,\n\nand the speeds are\n\nX? = ?\n?\n\n?\n\na\n\nsinE\n\n1? e cosE ,\n\nY? =\n\n?\n?\n\na\n\n?\n1? e2 cosE\n\n1? e cosE ,\n\nZ? = 0 .\n\nCoordinates in the Equatorial Plane\n\nTo transform from this frame to one identified with the frame ?, viz., the\nframe (O;x, y, z) fixed relative to the equatorial plane E , where Oz lies along\nthe polar axis, we must carry out three rotations, as specified by the Euler\nangles ?1 = ?, ?2 = i, ?3 = ? discussed in Chap. 5 (see Fig. 5.1). The desired\ncoordinates x, y, z and x?, y?, z? are deduced from X,Y, Z and X?, Y? , Z? by the\nproduct of three transformation matrices. The detailed calculation of these\nthree matrices and their product is carried out later, when we calculate the\nground track of the satellite. The transformation matrix P is given by (8.8).\n\nFor the angles used here, we obtain the 3\u00d7 3 matrix\n\nP =\n\n?\n??????\n\ncos? cos? ? cos? sin? sin? sin i\n? sin? sin? cos i ? sin? cos? cos i\n\nsin? cos? ? sin? sin? ? cos? sin i\n+cos? sin? cos i +cos? cos? cos i\n\nsin? sin i cos? sin i cos i\n\n?\n??????\n\n.\n\nThe quantities X,Y, Z, X?, Y? , Z? depend only on the three orbital elements a,\ne, and E (and E will subsequently be replaced by M). The entries of the\nmatrix P depend only on the three other elements ?, i, and ?. The quantities\nx, y, z, x?, y?, z? depend on the six orbital elements:?\n\n?xy\nz\n\n?\n? = P(?, i, ?)\n\n?\n?X(a, e, E)Y (a, e, E)\n\n0\n\n?\n? , (6.34)\n\n\n\n6.3 Perturbative Method: Solution 181\n\n?\n? x?y?\n\nz?\n\n?\n? = P(?, i, ?)\n\n?\n?

Naturally, we choose the\nperigee, where v = E = M = 0, since this point allows the greatest simpli-\nfication. The relation between dE and dM , which follows from (4.79), has\nalready been noted above.

(6.41)\n\n6.3.3 Lagrange Equations\n\nObtaining the Lagrange Equations\n\nWe can now rewrite (6.30), expressing the partial derivatives of F in terms\nof the nonzero Lagrange brackets, whence the six quantities ?F/?Sk, with\nk = 1, . . . , 6 are given by\n\n?F\n\n?a\n= + [a;?] ?? + [a;?] ?? + [a;M ] M? , (6.42)\n\n?F\n\n?e\n= + [e;?] ?? + [e;?] ?? , (6.43)\n\n?F\n\n?i\n= + [i;?] ?? , (6.44)\n\n?F\n\n??\n= ?

Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nLagrange Equations in Terms of the Perturbative Potential\n\nWe can now write the equations for the time dependence of the orbital\nelements in terms of the perturbing potential R. The results are shown in\nTable 6.2. This system of equations constitutes the full set of Lagrange\u2019s equa-\ntions, which correspond, by successive equivalences, to the original equation\ngiven in (6.13), i.e., the equation of motion. This can be written in matrix\nform using the matrix L, equivalent to L0 defined above by (6.48). It corre-\nsponds to the initial system of equations (6.17) or (6.20), in which we have\nsubstituted M for ? :\n\nM ? nt = ? , ?R\n?M\n\n=\n?R\n??\n\n.\n\nTo conclude this section, we have shown that, when the perturbative accelera-\ntion field derives from a potential, the satellite motion is defined by Lagrange\u2019s\nequations. We check that, if R = 0, we recover the solution of the two-body\nproblem, i.e., Kepler\u2019s solution in which a, e, i, ?, ? are constant and the mean\nanomaly is given byM = n(t?tp), corresponding to ? constant. In the general\niterative case, we treat R as expressed in terms of the new variables.\n\n6.3.4 Metric and Angular Orbital Elements\n\nThe matrix L clearly brings out the separation of the orbital elements into\ntwo groups: on the one hand a, e, i, and on the other, ?,?,M . Indeed we see\nthat, in Lagrange\u2019s equations, the time derivatives of a, e, i involve only the\npartial derivatives of R with respect to ?,?,M , and conversely. This can be\nexpressed in a global manner as follows:\n\n{\nda\n\ndt\n,\nde\n\ndt\n,\ndi\n\ndt\n\n}\n= f1\n\n(\na, e, i;\n\n?R\n??\n\n,\n?R\n??\n\n,\n?R\n?M\n\n)\n,\n\n{\nd?\n\ndt\n,\nd?\n\ndt\n,\ndM\n\ndt\n\n}\n= f2\n\n(\na, e, i;\n\n?R\n?a\n\n,\n?R\n?e\n\n,\n?R\n?i\n\n)\n,\n\nwhere f1 and f2 are functions of a, e, i and the partial derivatives mentioned.\nThe parameters (a, e, i) are called metric orbital elements,7 or more briefly,\n\nmetric elements, while the parameters ?,?,M are called angular (or angle)\nelements.\n\n7This term serves to distinguish the two groups of orbital elements. However, the term\n\u201cmetric\u201d is open to discussion. If it refers to the notion of length, only the quantity a is\nactually a length. If it is intended to contrast with the notion of angle, the inclination is\nactually an angle. Here, when the word \u201cmetric\u201d is attributed to e and i, it indicates that\nthese two elements behave mathematically like a. The Delaunay variables discussed later\navoid this ambiguity, since variables in the same group have the same physical dimensions.\n\n\n\n6.3 Perturbative Method: Solution 187\n\nIf pi denote the metric elements and qi the angular elements, the last two\nrelations can be written in the form\n\np?i = f1\n\n(\npi;\n\n?R\n?qi\n\n)\n, q?i = f2\n\n(\npi;\n\n?R\n?pi\n\n)\n. (6.56)\n\nNote. The quantity na2\n?\n1? e2 arises three times in the denominator of the\n\nexpressions in the system of equations presented in Table 6.2. Returning to\nthe Keplerian orbit relations for the osculating elements, (4.27) becomes\n\nC2 = ?p = ?a(1? e2) = n2a4(1? e2) ,\n\nand we thus see that the quantity in question is the magnitude of the angular\nmomentum of the satellite, denoted by C :\n\nC = na2\n?\n1? e2 = nab . (6.57)\n\n6.3.5 Poorly Defined Parameters\n\nThere are two situations, already discussed in the context of orbital el-\nements in Chap. 5, which can raise difficulties for the definition of certain\nparameters: the case e = 0 and the case i = 0:\n\n\u2022 The eccentricity e occurs in the denominator of the expressions for e?, ??,\nand M? in Lagrange\u2019s equations (see Table 6.2). If e is zero, these quantities\nare not defined. This is to be expected since, as we have seen, the perigee\nis not then defined, and this means that ? and M cannot be either.\n\n\u2022 The inclination i occurs in the denominator of i?, ??, and ??. If i is zero,\nthese quantities are not defined. This is also to be expected since, as the\nascending node is not defined, ? and ? cannot be either.\n\nIn these two cases, one solution is to drop the \u201cstandard\u201d orbital elements and\nreplace them by others, obtained by suitably chosen combinations of those.\nHowever, we shall see later that, when the perturbing potential is limited\nto the J2n term of the geopotential, the function R is such as to remove\nthe indeterminacy when e = 0 or i = 0. For example, with regard to the\nindeterminacy that arises in ??, we shall see that R is a function of sin2 i. Its\nderivative with respect to i yields a term in sin i cos i which cancels the term\nin sin i in the denominator of ??. In this case, the quantity ?? is perfectly well\ndefined for i = 0.\n\nWith this type of perturbative potential, we shall find that all the angular\nspeeds ??, ??, M? are well defined for e = 0 or i = 0 (or e = 0 and i = 0), even\nif the zero point of the angles is not.\n\n6.3.6 Delaunay Elements\n\nThe form of the matrix L given in Table 6.2, together with the symme-\ntries and similarities in the Lagrange brackets, suggest making a change of\n\n\n\n188 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nvariables to obtain an even simpler formulation of the results and to group\nthe elements into two homogeneous sets. These elements are known as the\nDelaunay elements.8 These variables are written as follows, clearly separating\nthe elements L, G, H , which have the dimensions of angular momentum per\nunit mass (action variables) and the associated angular elements l, g, h, which\nare dimensionless (angle variables):\n\n{\nL =\n\n?\n?a , G = L\n\n?\n1? e2 , H = G cos i ,\n\nl = M , g = ? , h = ? .\n(6.58)\n\nThe Lagrange equations can now be written in a very simple form, called the\nDelaunay equations:\n\n????\n???\n\ndL\n\ndt\n=\n\n?F\n\n?l\n,\n\ndG\n\ndt\n=\n\n?F\n\n?g\n,\n\ndH\n\ndt\n=\n\n?F\n\n?h\n,\n\ndl\n\ndt\n= ??F\n\n?L\n,\n\ndg\n\ndt\n= ??F\n\n?G\n,\n\ndh\n\ndt\n= ? ?F\n\n?H\n,\n\n(6.59)\n\nwhere\n\nF =\n?2\n\n2L2\n+R .\n\nIn canonical form, the equations are even simpler than in (6.56):\n\np?i =\n?F\n\n?qi\n, q?i = ?\n\n?F\n\n?pi\n, (6.60)\n\nwhere the pi are the action variables and the qi the associated angle variables.\nAccording to (6.57), G is the angular momentum C and H is its projection\n\nonto the polar axis Oz :\n\nH = C cos i = Cz . (6.61)\n\nWe shall not use the Delaunay variables in what follows (except for H a little\nlater). They are given here as an example of a homogeneous notation, in the\n\n8Charles Delaunay (1816\u20131872) was a French astronomer and author of many works,\nincluding a very detailed study of the motion of the Moon. He detected a slight disagreement\nbetween his predictions and observational results. Le Verrier claimed that the error lay\nin Delaunay\u2019s formulas, but the latter replied that the disagreements were the result of\nunknown causes. In 1865, Delaunay put forward the hypothesis that the discrepancy was\ndue to a very gradual slowing down of the Earth\u2019s rotation, caused by friction due to the\ntides. This is indeed the accepted theory today. Delaunay\u2019s method is no longer used to\nstudy the motion of the Moon, but it is still current practice for the moons of other planets.\n\nIt is worth making a few remarks about his magnum opus, The?orie du mouvement de\nla Lune (1867). The perturbation function R is given in the form of an equation with 1967\nterms, occupying 21 pages. As the author notes, it remains only to integrate R to obtain\nthe coordinates of the Moon as a function of time, using the Delaunay elements. That takes\nup the following 860 pages. (One must see it to believe it!)\n\n\n\n6.4 Perturbative Method: Results for the Geopotential up to J2 189\n\nsense of physical dimensions, leading to canonical equations. The Hamilto-\nnian method due to Von Zeipel and Brouwer9 involves integrating Lagrange\u2019s\nequations using the Delaunay variables.\n\n6.4 Perturbative Method: Results\n\nfor the Geopotential up to J2\n\nIn order to achieve what we set out to, that is, to find the time derivatives\nof the six orbital elements, we must apply Lagrange\u2019s equations. We must\ntherefore feed in the value of the perturbative potential R. We shall consider\nhere the perturbation due to the geopotential. We shall not tackle the other\ngravitational potentials, such as the lunisolar attraction potential, treated here\nas negligible.\n\nAs far as the geopotential is concerned, we shall proceed in stages, initially\nconsidering the first zonal harmonic (see Sect. 6.4.1), corresponding to the\nterm in J2, then all the zonal harmonics up to the term in Jn (see Sect. 6.5.1),\nand finally the general case, including all the zonal, sectorial, and tesseral\nharmonics (see Sect. 6.5.2).\n\n6.4.1 Expression for the Perturbative Potential up to J2\n\nWe expand the potential to second degree. Then using (3.27) and putting\nU = U0 +R, we find the following value for R :\n\nR = ??R\n2\n\nr3\nJ2\n\n3 sin2 ? ? 1\n2\n\n. (6.62)\n\nTo integrate this over a period, we first find r and ?.\n\nExpressions for r and ?\n\nThe distance r can be expressed as a function of a, e, and v, as we have\nseen. Equation (4.60) gives\n\nr =\na(1? e2)\n1 + e cos v\n\n. (6.63)\n\nThe angle ? is the geocentric latitude of the satellite. To find an expression for\n?, we consider the following points, as shown in Fig. 6.3: the projection N of\nthe ascending node, the projection S0 of the satellite, and the point Q where\nthe meridian through S0 intersects the equator, i.e., the intersection of the\nhalf-plane S0Oz with the equatorial circle. In the spherical triangle NS0Q,\n\n9This method was developed by Von Zeipel in 1916 to study asteroids, and it was taken\nup again by Brouwer in 1959 for application to artificial satellites.\n\n\n\n190 Chapter 6.

The known sides of the triangle (arcs of a great circle) are\n\n\n\n\nQS0= ? ,\n\n\n\nNS0= ? .\n\nAlong with (ST VIII), the sine rule (see Sect. 6.13) gives\n\n1\n\nsin?\n=\n\nsin i\n\nsin?\n. (6.64)\n\nNow, with ? = ? + v (since ? is the position on orbit), this leads to\n\nsin? = sin i sin(? + v) . (6.65)\n\nExpression for R\nIt thus turns out that R is a function of constant quantities (a, e, i, ? are\n\nconsidered to be constant over one revolution) and v. It thus varies period-\nically, with the same period T = 2?/n as the Keplerian motion. We note\nthat R does not depend on ?. This was to be expected insofar as the only\nperturbation we are considering arises from the replacement of the sphere by\nan ellipsoid of revolution. In this situation, the terrestrial longitude is irrele-\nvant. The position of the ascending node, and hence the value of ?, is of no\nconsequence, and we have\n\n?R\n??\n\n= 0 . (6.66)\n\n\n\n6.4 Perturbative Method: Results for the Geopotential up to J2 191\n\nIntegrating R over a Period\nWe calculate ?R?, the average value of R over one period T , by integrating\n\nwith respect to time, i.e., with respect to the mean anomaly M :\n\n?R? = 1\nT\n\n? T\n0\n\nRdt = 1\n2?\n\n? 2?\n0\n\nRdM .\n\nWe first express dM as a function of dv. This relation is given by (4.81), which\nwe obtained by applying the areal law:\n\ndM =\nr2\n\na2\n?\n1? e2\n\ndv .\n\nUsing the variables r, ?, and v, and as the bounds of integration are the same\nfor v and M , we obtain\n\n2? ?R? = ? ?R\n2J2\n\n2a2(1? e2)1/2\n? 2?\n0\n\n3 sin2 ? ? 1\nr\n\ndv .\n\nUsing (6.63) and (6.65), this yields\n\n2? ?R? = ? ?R\n2J2\n\n2a3(1 ? e2)3/2 I ,\n\nwhere\n\nI =\n? 2?\n0\n\n{\n3 sin2 i\n\n2\n\n[\n1? cos 2(v + ?)\n\n]\n? 1\n}\n(1 + e cos v)dv .\n\nExpanding the terms in this expression, we see that integration of the terms\nperiodic in v over the interval [0, 2?] will give zero, e.g.,\n\n? 2?\n0\n\ncos v cos 2(? + v) dv =\n1\n\n6\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n[\nsin(3v + 2?) + 3 sin(v + 2?)\n\n]\ndv = 0 .\n\nThe only nonzero contribution comes from the constant terms, independent\nof v, which yields\n\n? 2?\n0\n\n(\n3 sin2 i\n\n2\n? 1\n)\n\ndv = 2?\n\n(\n3 sin2 i\n\n2\n? 1\n)\n\n.\n\nThe average value of the potential is thus, up to degree 2,\n\n?R2? = ?R? = ?\n1\n\n4\n\n?R2\n\na3(1? e2)3/2 J2\n(\n3 sin2 i? 2\n\n)\n. (6.67)\n\n\n\n192 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nPeriodic and Secular Variations\n\nThe integration of R over one period shows that we can decompose this\nquantity into two parts:\n\nR(v) = Rs +Rp(v) , (6.68)\nwhere the constant Rs = ?R? represents the average value and the periodic\npartRp averages to zero over one period. The only part of the potential having\na long-term effect (over times longer than the period T ) is therefore Rs. These\nvariations, slow but proportional to the time, are called secular10 variations\n(in contrast to Rp, which causes only periodic effects).\n\nThe secular variations of the elements are obtained by differentiating this\npart Rs of the perturbative potential R. Equation (6.67) shows that Rs = ?R?\ncan be expressed entirely in terms of the metric elements:\n\nRs = Rs(a, e, i) .\n\n6.4.2 Variation of the Orbital Elements\n\nCalculating the Variation of the Orbital Elements\n\nWe can at last apply Lagrange\u2019s equations. Referring to the six equations\nin Table 6.2, we replace the perturbing potential R by its secular part Rs.\nThe time derivatives da/dt, de/dt, and di/dt of the metric elements obtained\nby differentiating with respect to the angle elements are therefore all zero.\nConsequently, the parameters a, e, i remain constant in time.\n\nOn the other hand, we see that the time derivatives of the angle elements\nd?/dt, d?/dt, dM/dt, obtained by differentiating with respect to the metric\nelements, are nonzero. The partial derivatives of Rs expressed in (6.67) yield\n\n?Rs\n?a\n\n= ?3\na\nRs ,\n\n?Rs\n?e\n\n=\n3e\n\n1? e2Rs ,\n?Rs\n?i\n\n=\n6 sin i cos i\n\n3 sin2 i? 2\nRs . (6.69)\n\nWe replace ? by n2a3 to obtain the final result:\n\na? = 0 , (6.70)\n\ne? = 0 , (6.71)\n\ni? = 0 , (6.72)\n\n?? = ? 3\n2(1? e2)2nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2\ncos i , (6.73)\n\n10The word \u201csecular\u201d comes from the Latin s\u00e6culum, meaning \u201ccentury\u201d, \u201coccurring\nevery hundred years\u201d. In the sixteenth century, the term was taken up in astronomy to\nindicate an effect that would take centuries to become noticeable.\n\n\n\n6.4 Perturbative Method: Results for the Geopotential up to J2 193\n\n?? =\n3\n\n4(1? e2)2nJ2\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2 (\n5 cos2 i ? 1\n\n)\n, (6.74)\n\nM? ? n = ?n = 3\n4(1? e2)3/2nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2 (\n3 cos2 i? 1\n\n)\n. (6.75)\n\nAs a function of time t, and starting from the origin t = 0, the orbital elements\nare thus\n\na(t) = a0 , e(t) = e0 , i(t) = i0 , (6.76)\n\n?(t) = ?0 + ??t , ?(t) = ?0 + ??t , (6.77)\n\nM(t) = M0 + nt+ (?n)t . (6.78)\n\nThis system of equations represents the solution of the equation of mo-\ntion (6.13) as a function of the orbital elements.\n\nRemarks Concerning the Variation of the Orbital Elements\n\nTo sum up, if we compare the actual trajectory of the satellite (perturbed\nby the action of the J2 term of the geopotential) with the Keplerian trajectory,\nwe observe the following points:\n\n1. The semi-major axis a of the orbit remains constant.\n2. The eccentricity e of the orbit remains constant.\n3. The inclination i of the orbit with respect to the equatorial plane is con-\n\nstant.\n4. The orbital plane rotates uniformly about the polar axis with a constant\n\nangular speed ??. This motion is known as precession of the orbit or nodal\nprecession.11 When we speak of precession without further specification,\nwe are generally referring to this motion. According to (6.73), it can oc-\ncur either in the prograde or the retrograde direction, depending on the\ninclination of the satellite orbit:\n\nprograde ?? ? 0 ?? cos i ? 0 ?? i? ?? D1 ,\n\nretrograde ?? ? 0 ?? cos i ? 0 ?? i? ? D1 ,\n\nwhere D1 = [0.00, 90.00] in degrees of arc.\n\n11The word \u201cnodal\u201d means that the motion concerns the line of nodes, i.e., the line\njoining the ascending and descending nodes. This straight line is the intersection of the\nequatorial plane with the orbital plane, as introduced in Chap. 5. The word \u201capsidal\u201d, used\nin a moment, means that the motion concerns the line of apsides, i.e., the line joining the\nperigee and the apogee, as discussed in Chap. 4.\n\n\n\n194 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\n5. The perigee, and hence the whole orbit, rotate uniformly in the plane of\nthe orbit with constant angular speed ??. This motion is called apsidal\nprecession. According to (6.74), it can occur in the prograde or retrograde\ndirection, depending on the inclination of the satellite orbit:\n\nprograde ?? ? 0 ?? sin2 i ? 4\n5\n\n?? i? ?? D2 ,\n\nretrograde ?? ? 0 ?? sin2 i ? 4\n5\n\n?? i? ? D2 ,\n\nwhere D2 = [63.43, 116.57] in degrees of arc. We define the critical inclina-\ntion by\n\niC = arcsin\n\n(\n2?\n5\n\n)\n. (6.79)\n\nFor the two values, the angle iC and its supplement, the rate of apsidal\nprecession ?? is zero:\n\n?? = 0 ??\n{\ni = iC = 63.43\n\n? ,\ni = 180? ? iC = 116.57? .\n\n(6.80)\n\nThe value of the critical inclination is independent of a and e. It is im-\nportant for certain satellites in highly elliptical orbit, because one seeks\nto avoid apsidal precession: as we shall see, in the case of Molniya-type\ncommunications satellites, the position of the apogee remains fixed on the\norbit.\n\nWhen ?? is calculated using an expansion going beyond the J2 term, the\nvalue obtained for iC depends very slightly on a and e. It differs by a few\nhundredths of a degree from the value given by (6.79) (see Example 7.1).\n\n6. The (true) mean motion of the satellite is not the same as it would have\nbeen if there were no flattening. According to (6.75), it may be faster or\nslower depending on the inclination of the satellite:\n\nfaster ?n ? 0 =? sin2 i ? 2\n3\n\n=? i? ?? D3 ,\n\nslower ?n ? 0 =? sin2 i ? 2\n3\n\n=? i? ? D3 ,\n\nwhere D3 = [54.74, 125.26]. Below we define the various periods associated\nwith the motion.\n\nExample calculations are given in the following chapters. Figures 7.1, 7.3,\nand 7.4 show dependence of the quantities ??, ??, and ?n, respectively, on the\ninclination.\n\nNote. The signs of the three quantities ??, ??, and M? ?n relating to the angle\nelements depend only on the inclination i.\n\n\n\n6.5 Perturbative Method: Results for General Case 195\n\n6.5 Perturbative Method: Results\n\nfor General Case\n\n6.5.1 Geopotential up to Jn\n\nRemark Concerning Zonal Harmonics\n\nThere is an interesting point when we assume that the Earth has an axial\nsymmetry, as we shall see below. In this case, the geopotential involves only\nzonal harmonics (i.e., the expansion involves only the Jn terms and not the\nsectorial or tesseral harmonics), whose contribution to the full potential is by\nfar the greatest, as we have seen. The perturbative acceleration ?P defined\nby (6.15) then lies in the plane containing the satellite and the polar axis. It\ncan thus be decomposed as\n\n?P = ?1er + ?2ez , (6.81)\n\nwhere the unit vector alongOS is denoted by er, and the unit vector along the\npolar axisOz by ez. Using (4.5), the time derivative of the angular momentum\nC is\n\ndC\n\ndt\n= r ? r? = rer ?\n\n[(\n? ?\nr2\n\n+ ?1\n\n)\ner + ?2ez\n\n]\n= r?2 (er ? ez) ,\n\nwhich is perpendicular to ez. If Cz is the projection of C onto the polar axis,\nwe thus have\n\ndCz\ndt\n\n=\ndC\n\ndt\n\u00b7ez = 0 .\n\nWe saw earlier, in (6.61), that Cz corresponds to the Delaunay variable H ,\nwhich gives here\n\ndH\n\ndt\n=\n\ndCz\ndt\n\n= 0 .\n\nWe deduce the following property:\n\nH =\n?\n?a(1? e2) cos i = ??p cos i = constant . (6.82)\n\nThis relation is a very general feature of orbits perturbed by zonal terms\nwith the same axis. We note the following formula, obtained by differentiat-\ning (6.82):\n\n1\n\n2a\nda =\n\ne\n\n1? e2de + tan i di . (6.83)\n\n\n\n196 Chapter 6.

We may then recover\nthe result noted earlier: if the geopotential does not involve the longitude,\nthat is, if it only involves the zonal harmonics, then R (or F ) is independent\nof ?, as can be seen in the relation (6.66).\n\nCalculating the Perturbative Potential R\nWe now consider the Earth as a body with axial symmetry. The potential\n\nU involves only the terms Jn. The full formula (3.28) reduces to\n\nU(r, ?) =\n?\n\nr\n\n[\n1?\n\n??\nn=2\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)n\nJnPn(sin?)\n\n]\n. (6.85)\n\nThe perturbative potential R is obtained as the difference between U and U0.\nThis then replaces the value given by (6.62).\n\n(a) Third Degree Expansion. We begin our calculation of R by expanding\nup to third degree, thereby bringing in the Legendre polynomials P2(sin?)\nand P3(sin?). We obtain\n\nR = ??\nr\n\n[\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)2\n3 sin2 ? ? 1\n\n2\n+ J3\n\n(\nR\n\nr\n\n)3\n5 sin2 ? ? 3\n\n2\nsin?\n\n]\n. (6.86)\n\nWritten in simplified form (with Rn for degree n),\n\nR = R2 +R3 ,\n\nwhere R2 corresponds to the sum Rs +Rp given in (6.68).\nAs before for R = R2, we calculate the average value ?R3? of R3 over a\n\nperiod:\n\n2? ?R3? =\n? 2?\n0\n\nR3 dM = ?\n?R3J3\n\n2a2(1? e2)1/2\n? 2?\n0\n\n5 sin2 ? ? 3\nr2\n\nsin? dv ,\n\nusing (4.81). Further, with the help of (6.63) and (6.65), we obtain\n\n2? ?R3? = ?\n?R3J3\n\n2a4(1? e2)5/2 sin iJ ,\n\nwhere\n\nJ =\n? 2?\n0\n\n[\n5 sin2 i sin2(? + v)? 3\n\n]\n(1 + e cos v)2 sin(? + v) dv .\n\n\n\n6.5 Perturbative Method: Results for General Case 197\n\nThis integration is tedious to carry out \u201cby hand\u201d. With a clever decompo-\nsition, one can use tables giving the values of definite integrals (from 0 to\n2?). These tables, like those of F. Tisserand, avoid the need to recalculate\nintegrals. They have been established over the centuries by astronomers. The\nsimplest thing today is to use a suitable computer software. We thus obtain\n\nJ = 2? 3e\n4\n\n(\n5 sin2 i? 4\n\n)\nsin? ,\n\nwhence the expression for ?R3? is\n\n?R3? =\n3\n\n8\n\n?R3e\n\na4(1 ? e2)5/2 J3\n(\n?5 sin2 i+ 4\n\n)\nsin i sin? . (6.87)\n\nThis term R3(a, e, i, ?) will lead to long-period variations because it depends\non the angle element ? in addition to the metric elements. It can be written\nin the form\n\n?R3? (a, e, i, ?) = ?R?3? (a, e, i) sin? .\n\nHowever, it will not produce secular variations, because if we integrate its\nvalue over a round trip of the perigee during its apsidal revolution, the result\nwill be zero:\n\n2? ??R3?? =\n? 2?\n0\n\n?R3? (a, e, i, ?) d?\n\n= ?R?3? (a, e, i)\n? 2?\n0\n\nsin? d? = 0 . (6.88)\n\nLooking at the successive integrations, we note that ??R3?? is equal to 0,\nbecause sin? is a factor in R3, and that in turn because x = sin? is a factor\nin the Legendre polynomial P3(x).\n\nReferring to the appendix on Legendre functions in Sect. 3.7, we see that\nthe variable x is a factor in the expressions for all odd degree polynomials.\nWe deduce, therefore, that the terms Jn with odd n make no contribution to\nthe secular variation of the orbital elements:\n\n??Rn?? = 0 for odd n ?? no secular variation . (6.89)\n\n(b) Fourth Degree Expansion. For degree 4, we use the Legendre polyno-\nmial P4(sin?) and proceed as before. This leads to\n\n?R4? =\n1\n\n64\n\n?R4e\n\na5(1 ? e2)7/2 J4\n(\n?105 sin4 i+ 120 sin2 i? 24\n\n)\n. (6.90)\n\nLike R2, the term R4 will produce secular variations for the three angle ele-\nments ?, ?, and M ? nt. Here, these variations will be proportional to J4.\n\n\n\n198 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nIf we consider secular variations beyond degree 2, we can no longer neglect\nthe fact that the mean motion n, which enters into the expressions for ??, ??,\nand M? ? n, has a secular variation proportional to J2. There will thus be a\nterm in J22 in addition to the terms in J4, J6, etc. Note that, if J2 is of order\n10?3, the terms J4, J6, etc., are of order 10?6, as is J22 [see (7.15)\u2013(7.17) and\nTable 7.1].\n\nPeriodic and Secular Variations\n\nFrom (6.85), we obtain R as a function of five orbital parameters (since ?\ndoes not occur):\n\nR = R(a, e, i, ?,M) .\n\nThe potential R decomposes into a sum of termsRn, one for each term Jn. We\nconsider Lagrange\u2019s equations as given in Table 6.2. It can be shown that:\n\n\u2022 If a term Rn depends on neither M nor ?, it causes a variation in the\nrelevant orbital element which is proportional to the time, i.e., a secular\nvariation.\n\n\u2022 If a term Rn depends on ?, but not on M , there will be a variation whose\nperiod will be of the order of the apsidal precession, i.e., a long-period\nperiodic variation.\n\n\u2022 If a term Rn depends on both ? and M , there will be a variation whose\nperiod will be of the order of the Keplerian period, i.e., a short-period\nperiodic variation.\n\nTo sum up, periodic variations are divided into short-period variations, cor-\nresponding to the period of M , and long-period variations, occurring over\nseveral tens of days (? 1,000T ), corresponding to the apsidal period of ?.\nThe latter are mainly due to the influence of the J3 term which affects espe-\ncially e and the angle elements. There is no long-period perturbation of the\nsemi-major axis a. This result is known as the invariability of the major axis,\nand it applies to many types of motion in astronomy (see Sect. 6.9).\n\nSecular variations are variations proportional to time. Naturally, it is this\nkind of variation that deviates the satellite from its Keplerian orbit. We have\nseen that the J2 term causes secular deviations in the three angle elements,\nwhile having no effect on the metric elements. The other zonal harmonics,\nalthough only the even ones, i.e., J4, J6, . . . , J2p, . . . , also contribute to secular\ndeviations (see Table 7.1). Figure 6.4 shows in a schematic way all the periodic\nand secular variations of the orbital elements.\n\nExample 6.1 Calculate the effect of perturbations when the geopotential is\nexpanded up to the term in J3.

Short-\n\nperiod variations are shown with a continuous curve and long-period variations with\n\na dot-dashed curve. Secular variations are shown with a dashed line. The amplitudes\n\nof the periodic variations have been greatly exaggerated for visibility.\n\n? The potential R is given by (6.86). We have just seen that it can be written\nin the form\n\nR = (Rs +Rp) +R3 ,\n\nif the expansion is cut off at degree 3. The term Rs(a, e, i) is given by (6.67).\nThe term Rp(a, e, i, ?,M) leads to short-period variations which we shall not\ndiscuss here. The term R3 is given by (6.87). This term R3(a, e, i, ?) will\nproduce long-period variations which we shall now calculate.\n\nSince ?R3/?M = 0 and ?R3/?? = 0, the equations for the metric ele-\nments, the first three Lagrange equations (see Table 6.2), become\n\nda\n\ndt\n= 0 ,\n\nde\n\ndt\n= ? 1\n\nna2\n\n?\n1? e2\ne\n\n?R3\n??\n\n,\ndi\n\ndt\n=\n\n1\n\nna2\n1?\n\n1? e2\ncos i\n\nsin i\n\n?R3\n??\n\n.\n\nThis implies\n\nde\n\ndi\n= ?1? e\n\n2\n\ne\ntan i , (6.91)\n\nwhich is equivalent to (6.83) when a is constant (and this is almost always\nthe case for the kinds of motion occurring in astronomy). To calculate the\nvariation arising in i as a result of R3, we start with di/dt above, differentiate\nR3 with respect to ?, and replace ? by n2a3. This gives\n\ndi\n\ndt\n=\n\n3e\n\n2(1? e2)3nJ3\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)3 (\n1? 5\n\n4\nsin2 i\n\n)\ncos i cos? . (6.92)\n\n\n\n200 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nTo find the long-period variation in i due to the zonal harmonic J3, we rewrite\ndi/d?, with the value for ?? calculated using (6.74):\n\ndi\n\nd?\n=\n\ndi\n\ndt\n\ndt\n\nd?\n=\n\n1\n\n??\n\ndi\n\ndt\n=\n\n1\n\n2\n\ne\n\n1? e2\nJ3\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)\ncos i cos? .\n\nThe required quantity is thus\n\n?LP3i =\n1\n\n2\n\ne\n\n1? e2\nJ3\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)\ncos i sin? , (6.93)\n\nwhere the subscript LP3 indicates that this is a long-period effect due to the\nzonal harmonic J3. To obtain the corresponding variation in e, we use (6.91),\ntaking ?LP3e/?LP3 i for de/di :\n\n?LP3e = ?\n1\n\n2\n\nJ3\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)\nsin i sin? . (6.94)\n\nConversely, one can determine the value of J3 by measuring the values of\n?LP3i and ?LP3e (see the historical note in Sect. 6.7).\n\nImportant Note. For near-circular orbits (e ? 10?3), we find that, with (6.93)\nand (6.93), or directly from (6.91), we have\n\n?LP3i ? ?\ne\n\ntan i\n?LP3e . (6.95)\n\nOwing to the factor e, the variation ?LP3 i of the inclination is negligible\ncompared with the variation of the eccentricity ?LP3e (except for equatorial\norbits). ?\n\nExample 6.2 Calculate the variation of the orbital elements over one\nrevolution.\n\n? Recall that p is the semi-latus rectum of the ellipse, with p = a(1 ? e2).\nThese variations carry the subscript 1 to indicate that they refer to the value\nobtained over one revolution. The variations, be they secular or long-period,\nare sufficiently slow to be able to avoid integrating over the time t. Indeed, it\nsuffices to multiply the derivative with respect to t of the relevant quantity\nby T = 2?/n.\n\nFor the angle elements, the periodic variations are negligible compared\nwith secular variations. However, these periodic variations are \u201cvisible\u201d for\nthe metric elements, where there are no secular variations.\n\nFor the angle variables, we write ?1? = ??T and ?1? = ??T , where the\nangles are of course given in radians. To first order, we take for ?? and ?? the\n\n\n\n6.5 Perturbative Method: Results for General Case 201\n\nvalues given by (6.73) and (6.74), respectively, as a function of J2 alone, when\nexpanding the geopotential:\n\n?1? = ?3?J2\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)2\ncos i , (6.96)\n\n?1? = +3?J2\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)2\n2\n\n(\n1? 5\n\n4\nsin2 i\n\n)\n. (6.97)\n\nFor the metric variables, the case for a can be dealt with immediately, since\nwe may consider that a? is zero (invariability of the major axis). Concerning\nthe expressions for e? and i?, we use (6.92) and (6.91). We consider only the\nfirst term (the J3 term) of the expansion. For the variations over one period,\nwe then obtain\n\n?1a ? 0 , (6.98)\n\n?1e = ?3?J3\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)3\n(1? e2)\n\n(\n1? 5\n\n4\nsin2 i\n\n)\nsin i cos? , (6.99)\n\n?1i = +3?J3\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)3\ne\n\n(\n1? 5\n\n4\nsin2 i\n\n)\ncos i cos? . (6.100)\n\nThe critical inclination plays an important role for ?1?, ?1e, and ?1i. ?\n\n6.5.2 Full Geopotential\n\nWhen we consider the geopotential U(r, ?, ?) given by (3.17), it is ex-\ntremely difficult to calculate the effects of the perturbative potential R.\nHowever, let us just mention the existence of orbital resonance phenomena:\nthe influence of certain tesseral coefficients Clm and Slm, defined by (3.20)\nand (3.21), can, for one specific orbit, significantly exceed the effects of coef-\nficients with higher or lower order and degree. For these values, the periodic\nperturbations have relatively large amplitude. W. Kaula has developed a for-\nmalism which predicts the resonances associated with these specific orbits.\n\nThis resonance phenomenon is particularly important for recurrent satel-\nlites with a 1-day recurrence cycle, i.e., effecting a whole number ? of revo-\nlutions per day. Tesseral harmonics with order a multiple of ? must be taken\ninto account in orbital extrapolations, i.e., precise determination of satellite\nposition at a given time from its osculating elements. Particularly important\nare the following:\n\n\n\n202 Chapter 6.

For example, for the satellites\nSPOT-1 to -5, where ? = 14+5/26, there is a resonance for the tesseral terms\nof orders 15 and 29.\n\n6.5.3 Other Perturbative Forces Deriving\nfrom a Potential\n\nThe non-terrestrial gravitational potential is due almost entirely to the\nlunisolar potential. The elements a and e are not affected by secular variations.\nThe various orbital elements undergo slight variations with long period. For\ncertain orbits, we observe a very slight secular drift in ?. These results are\nsummarised in Table 6.3, for a low-orbiting satellite.\n\n6.5.4 Perturbative Forces not Derived from a Potential\n\nAtmospheric drag has ever greater effect as the satellite orbit becomes\nlower. It can be shown that e tends to decrease (drag is greater at the perigee\nthan at the apogee, and this has the effect of making the orbit more circular).\nFurthermore, a decreases (one would expect friction to make the satellite fall\ntoward the Earth). The other elements are not significantly affected, at least\n\n12For Molniya, the tesseral harmonic coefficients with the most effect are C22, C32, C52,\nC44, C54, C64, C66, C76, C86, C98, and the corresponding Slm.\n\n13For a geostationary satellite, resonance periods of 24 h and 48 h are associated with\ntesseral harmonics of order 1 (C31, C41, and the corresponding Sl1), and resonance peri-\nods of 12, 24, 36, and 48 h are associated with those of order 2 (C22, C32, C42, and the\ncorresponding Sl2).\n\n\n\n6.5 Perturbative Method: Results for General Case 203\n\nnot directly. However, the changes in a and e, which may be considered propor-\ntional to the time t (secular variation), induce changes in the angle parameters\nwhich rapidly dominate over periodic variations because they are proportional\nto t2 (for variations going as t2, see also the drift in local time and Example\n10.7 in Chap. 10). Forces induced by (solar and terrestrial) radiation pressure\nalso affect the variation of the orbital elements (see Table 6.3). The effect of\natmospheric drag on a is treated in the appendix in Sect. 6.6.\n\nWhen the perturbing acceleration ?P does not derive from a potential,\nwe use a coordinate system moving with the orbit and decompose the vector\nrelative to this. This gives a system of equations called Gauss\u2019 equations. We\nshall not discuss this method further.\n\n6.5.5 Different Definitions of the Period\n\nThe three angles associated with Keplerian motion, the anomalies v, E,\nand M , increase by 2? when the time increases by 2?/n, where n is the mean\nmotion. As can be seen from (4.65) and (4.57), the origin from which these\nangles are measured is taken at the time t = tp when the satellite passes the\nperigee. The time lapse between two successive passages at perigee is called\nthe anomalistic period.14 It is therefore the anomalistic period Ta which is\nobtained with the mean motion n, and this differs from the period T0 obtained\nwith the Keplerian mean motion n0. We have the definition\n\nnTa = n0T0 . (6.101)\n\nWith n = n0 +?n, calculated using (6.75), we obtain\n\nTa =\n\n(\n1? ?n\n\nn\n\n)\nT0 . (6.102)\n\nWe would also like to know the time interval between two passages at the\nascending node (or the descending node). This is the nodal period or dra-\nconitic15 period Td. This differs from Ta because the perigee moves through\napsidal precession. It should be noted that this happens even in the case of a\ncircular orbit , since ?? does not vanish when e is zero. We have the relation\n\nndTd = nTa , (6.103)\n\n14The adjective \u201canomalistic\u201d derives from the word \u201canomaly\u201d, since the three anomalies\nare all zero (modulo 2?) at the perigee.\n\n15The adjective \u201cdraconitic\u201d was originally used for the draconitic period or month, which\nrefers to the passage of the Moon at its ascending node. The word comes from the Greek ?\n#?\"???? ????\t, meaning \u201cdragon\u201d (literally, \u201cwhich stares\u201d). Eclipses only occur when the\nMoon passes through a node of its orbit. In ancient times, the Greeks thought that, during\nan eclipse, the moon was swallowed up by a dragon, hiding near the nodes of the lunar\norbit.\n\n\n\n204 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nwhere nd is the mean motion when the ascending node is taken as origin.\nComposing the two motions, we have\n\nnd = n+ ?? , (6.104)\n\nyielding one period in terms of the other:\n\nTd =\n1\n\n1 + ??/n\nTa , (6.105)\n\nTa =\n\n(\n1 +\n\n??\n\nn\n\n)\nTd . (6.106)\n\nThe draconitic period Td is given in terms of the Keplerian period T0 by\n\nTd =\n1??n/n\n1 + ??/n\n\nT0 , (6.107)\n\nor, to a first approximation,\n\nTd ?\n(\n1? ?? +?n\n\nn\n\n)\nT0 (6.108)\n\nWith this approximation and for a circular orbit, i.e., e = 0 in (6.74)\nand (6.75), we obtain\n\nTd ?\n[\n1? 3\n\n2\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2 (\n4 cos2 i? 1\n\n)]\nT0 . (6.109)\n\nFor i = 60? and i = 120?, we note that the draconitic period Td is equal to\nthe Keplerian period T0.\n\nIn brief, the period Ta is mainly used to calculate the semi-major axis of\nthe orbit. For everything relating to the motion of the satellite in a frame fixed\nrelative to the Earth, it is the draconitic period Td which comes into play. For\nKeplerian motion, there is no need to make these distinctions between periods,\nsince they obviously coincide in this case.\n\n6.6 Appendix: Atmospheric Drag\n\n6.6.1 Description of the Earth\u2019s Atmosphere\n\nThe Earth\u2019s atmosphere can be divided up according to physical criteria\ninto zones determined by altitude and called spheres.\n\nIf we use the criterion of vertical temperature gradient, then starting at\nground level, we encounter the troposphere and the stratosphere in roughly\nthe first 50 km, the mesosphere up to 100 km, then the thermosphere and the\nexosphere. The lower regions, below 200 km, are of no relevance to satellites\n\n\n\n6.6 Appendix: Atmospheric Drag 205\n\nexcept for questions of signal transmission, something we shall return to when\nwe discuss navigation satellites (GPS) in Chap. 14.\n\nIf the criterion is the relative proportions of the majority chemical con-\nstituents, we distinguish the homosphere and the heterosphere, the transition\nbeing located at around 100km altitude. In the homosphere, thanks to mix-\ning effects, the atmosphere remains homogeneous with regard to its chemical\ncomponents (at least those that are not subject to photochemical reactions),\nand this whatever the pressure. The air we breathe on the coast or at the top\nof a mountain is also composed of 78% nitrogen N2, 21% oxygen O2, and\n1% argon Ar. But above 100 km altitude, owing to the rarefaction of the air\nand the high temperature (a high level of molecular agitation with a large\nmean free path for the particles), the relative proportions of the constituents\nchanges completely and becomes mass dependent. Between 160 and 600km,\nthe predominant gas is monatomic oxygen O, and beyond that, one finds a\npredominance of the lighter atoms, i.e., helium He (dominant up to 2,000km)\nand hydrogen H.\n\nWhen we are interested in satellite motions, the crucial altitude range is\n200\u20131,200km. It soon becomes catastrophic for a satellite to pass at altitudes\nbelow 200km, and above 1,200km, the effects of atmospheric drag can be\nneglected, even over long periods, although other dissipative phenomena then\nbecome important, e.g., solar radiation pressure.\n\n6.6.2 Density of the Atmosphere\n\nWhen investigating atmospheric drag, the fundamental quantity we need\nto know is the mass per unit volume of the air. Generally known as the\natmospheric density, it is denoted by ? and expressed in units of kgm?3\n\n(although strictly speaking the density is not a mass per unit volume).\nIt is easy to calculate the altitude dependence of the density if we assume\n\nthat the atmosphere is at rest and isothermal, using the laws of thermody-\nnamics. The result is an exponential function:\n\n?(h) = ?0e\n?h/H , (6.110)\n\nwhere ?0 is the density at the reference altitude z0 and h = z ? z0 represents\nthe difference in altitude. The quantity H , with units of length, is the scale\nfactor, given by standard calculation as\n\nH =\nRT\n\nMg\n, (6.111)\n\nwith R = 8.31 (SI units) the perfect gas constant, T the temperature (K), M\nthe mean molar mass (kg) of the components, and g the acceleration due to\ngravity (m s?2).\n\n\n\n206 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nAt sea level, at a temperature of 15?C and a pressure of 1,013hPa, we\nhave\n\nT = 273 + 15 = 288 K , M =\n4\n\n5\n\u00d7 28 + 1\n\n5\n\u00d7 32 ? 29 g .\n\nThe value of ? is thus\n\n?0 =\n29\n\n22.4\n\u00d7 273\n\n288\n= 1.23 kgm?3 .\n\nCalculating the scale factor, we find that\n\nH =\n8.31\u00d7 288\n\n29\u00d7 10?3 \u00d7 9.81 = 8413 m , or H ? 8.4 km .\n\nAt an altitude of about 8 km, the density is divided by a factor of e, the\nEuler number, as compared with its value at sea level, whence it is equal to\n? = 0.44kgm?3.\n\nEven though the actual atmosphere may differ to some extent from the\nabove idealisation and the conditions assumed in establishing (6.110), the\nformula for ?(h) is nevertheless applicable in most cases, as experience shows.\n\nAt a given altitude in the relevant altitude range for our present purposes,\nviz., 200\u20131,200km, the atmospheric density depends sensitively on the level of\nsolar activity, whence its variations are driven by several cycles with different\nperiods:\n\n\u2022 An 11 year cycle which has been known for a long time, as revealed by\nobservation of sunspots (since 1749). Rather than simply counting spots, a\nmore objective criterion has been used since 1947, with the measurement,\nknown as F10.7, of the Sun\u2019s emission of the 10.7 cm radio wave. Over the\npast 50 years, maxima have occurred in the years 1968, 1980, 1991, 2002,\nand 2013.\n\n\u2022 An annual cycle, related to seasonal effects.\n\u2022 A 27 day cycle related to the synodic period of rotation of the Sun about\n\nits own axis.\n\u2022 A daily cycle, with a maximum for ? at around 15 h local time (?LMT) and\n\na minimum 12h later.\n\nIn addition, the atmospheric density also depends on the latitude of the ob-\nservation point.\n\n6.6.3 Models of the Atmosphere\n\nIn the face of such complexity, it was only logical to set up models of\nthe atmosphere.

The scale factor H is also given. Values are\n\naveraged over latitudes and seasons. Model MSIS-90.\n\nothers, direct descendants of the pioneers, naturally reflect the exponential\nimprovement in computer calculation capacity.\n\nWithout going into the details, we can now obtain the atmospheric density\nas a function of altitude h, local time ?LMT, the day of the year D, and the\nlatitude ? :\n\n?i(h, ?LMT, D, ?) , i = 1, 2, . . . , n , (6.112)\n\nwhere the index i indicates the level of solar activity (i = 1 for a year of\nminimal activity, i = 2 maximal, i = 3 average, and so on). Table 6.4 gives\nan idea of the kind of values one finds for ?.\n\n6.6.4 Calculation of Atmospheric Drag:\nThe Notion of ?V\n\nWe consider a satellite in Earth orbit, denoting its speed in the Galilean\nframe ? by V and its speed relative to the atmosphere by V?. If the atmosphere\nis at rest and without wind, V? is equal to V\n\n?, the speed relative to the\nterrestrial frame ?T.\n\nLet S be the cross-sectional area of the satellite in the direction normal to\nits displacement. In a time dt, the mass dm of air of mass per unit volume ?\nencountered by the satellite is\n\ndm = ?SV? dt . (6.113)\n\n\n\n208 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nThe corresponding momentum dp is\n\ndp = V? dm = ?SV\n2\n? dt , (6.114)\n\nand the force of friction F is therefore\n\nF =\ndp\n\ndt\n= ?SV 2? .\n\nTo take into account the nature of the impacts of the air molecules on the\nsatellite surface, we multiply F by a coefficient16 Cd/2, whence\n\nF =\n1\n\n2\nCd?SV\n\n2\n? . (6.115)\n\nThe dimensionless friction coefficient Cd varies from 1.5 to 3.0, depending on\nthe shape of the satellite. It can be shown that it is equal to 2 for a sphere.\n\nThe friction force F , given vectorially by\n\nF = ?F V ?\nV?\n\n, (6.116)\n\nhas the effect of slowing down the satellite of mass Ms. Applying the funda-\nmental law of dynamics, we have\n\ndV =\nF\n\nMs\ndt , dV = ?1\n\n2\nCd\n\nS\n\nMs\n?V 2? . (6.117)\n\nWe set\n\nB = Cd\nS\n\nMs\n. (6.118)\n\nThe coefficient B, known as the ballistic coefficient, has units of m2kg?1. It\ncharacterises the satellite with respect to drag.17 The larger the value of B,\nthe greater the drag effect will be. For example, for a \u201cstandard\u201d satellite\nwith Ms = 500kg, S = 10m\n\n2, Cd = 2.3, we have B = 0.046m\n2 kg?1 and\n\n1/B = 21.7kgm?2.\nIn the space technology community, it is standard practice to denote the\n\n(magnitude of the) change in the velocity over a finite time T by ?V (pro-\nnounced Delta V):\n\n?V =\n1\n\n2\nB\n\n? T\n0\n\n?V 2? dt . (6.119)\n\nIf ?V is calculated over one revolution, this is written ?1V .\n\n16It is amusing to note that the factor of 1/2 in front of Cd has no better justification\nthan to make this formula (6.115) look like other formulas of this kind, such as the formula\nfor the kinetic energy, where the factor of 1/2 has a mathematical origin.\n\n17To minimise these effects, the passive satellite Starlette (without its own energy supply)\nis designed as a sphere coated with 60 laser reflectors. It has a uranium core of density\n18.7. The mass of the satellite is 47 kg and its diameter 48 cm. With Cd = 2, we have\nB = 7.70\u00d7 10?3 and 1/B = 130 kgm?2.\n\n\n\n6.6 Appendix: Atmospheric Drag 209\n\nSimplified Case\n\nLet us calculate the value of ?V and the change over one revolution of the\nsemi-major axis a and the period T for a satellite in circular orbit. We assume\nthat the atmospheric density is constant over one revolution and equal to ?0.\nWe identify V? with V and consider the Keplerian case, taking the Earth to\nbe spherical. Since 2?a = V T , we thus find\n\n?1V = ?B?0aV . (6.120)\n\nDifferentiating V =\n?\n?/a, we have da/a = ?2?B?0a, whereupon\n\n?1a = ?2?B?0a2 . (6.121)\n\nLikewise for the period, with dT/T = (3/2)da/a, we have\n\n?1T = ?6?2B?0\na2\n\nV\n. (6.122)\n\nExample 6.3 Calculate the daily drop in altitude for a SPOT-type satellite.\n\n? For a SPOT-type satellite, with B = 0.046 and a = 7,200km, and which\nmakes about 14 revolutions per day, application of (6.121) yields\n\n?Da = 14?1a = ?2\u00d7 10?14? ,\n\nwhere ?D is the change in a over 1 day. We may thus estimate the drop in\naltitude each day using the values for ? at 800 km altitude:\n\nSolar activity\nCalm ? = 3\u00d7 10?15 ?Da = ?0.6 m\nAverage ? = 1\u00d7 10?14 ?Da = ?2.0 m\nHigh ? = 5\u00d7 10?14 ?Da = ?10 m\nVery high ? = 1.5\u00d7 10?13 ?Da = ?30 m\n\nThese results give an indication of the orders of magnitude involved here. ?\n\nImprovements in Atmospheric Models\n\nThe satellites CHAMP, GRACE-A and -B, and GOCE are equipped\nwith highly sensitive 3-axis accelerometers which measure the acceleration\nad and can be used to pilot drag compensation forces. According to (6.115)\nand (6.116),\n\nad = ?\n1\n\n2\nB?V 2?\n\nV ?\nV?\n\n. (6.123)\n\n\n\n210 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nThe values of ad, B, and V? are known, and we thus obtain the value of ? at all\ntimes along the trajectory. The sensitivity of the accelerometers is constantly\nbeing improved as can be seen from the values 10?9 ms?2 for CHAMP, 10?10\n\nfor GRACE, and 10?12 for GOCE.\n\n6.6.5 Effect of Drag on the Orbit\n\nAnalytical models of orbit propagation use similar methods to those pre-\nsented here. With the software Ixion, assuming that the satellite characteristics\nare well defined, we calculate the position of the satellite, its geodetic altitude,\nand its velocity relative to the Earth at each instant of time, in adjustable\nsteps of a few seconds. If the atmospheric model provides the wind velocity,\nwe calculate the vector V ?, otherwise V\n\n?. With ? given at the relevant al-\ntitude, place, and time, we calculate the frictional force F using (6.115) for\neach integration step.\n\nGoing back to the equations of motion with this force F , we use the King-\nHele theory to calculate a? and e?, the time derivatives of the semi-major axis\na and the eccentricity e. Calculation of the other parameters is complex. The\nchange in i is very small, and the periodic variations in ? and ? are swamped\nby their secular variations. The software continuously tracks the modified\ntrajectory. Or if the satellite is being held to a given trajectory, we deduce\nthe quantity ?V needed to do this.\n\n6.6.6 Simplified Calculations for an Eccentric Orbit:\nAir Braking\n\nThe quantity ?V is very important in space engineering, and in particular\nfor mission control. While atmospheric drag leads to a certain value of ?V ,\nconversely, a certain amount of ?V can be used to compensate for drag or to\ncarry out maneuvers to change the orbit. For those in charge of the technical\naspects, the cumulated value of ?V over the whole mission can be directly\ntranslated into an amount of fuel.\n\nWhile ?V is tedious to calculate either analytically or numerically, the\nfollowing method provides a simple way to estimate it over one period in\nthe case of elliptical orbits. The basic idea is that almost all the drag occurs\nnear the perigee, owing to the exponential decrease in ? with altitude, as\nattested by (6.110). During this relatively brief lapse of time, the speed V of\nthe satellite can be treated as constant, equal to Vp, the speed at perigee.\n\n18\n\n18For example, for a Molniya satellite, hp = 200 km, e = 0.75, a = 26, 313 km, T =\n708min, with a perigee passage at h = 200 km, ? = 1.031, at time t = 0, the passage at\naltitude h = 600 km, ? = 1.091, occurs at time t = 346 s. The satellite has thus spent\n2\u00d7 346 = 692 s = 11.5min in atmospheric layers between 200 and 600 km, which represents\n11.5/708 = 0.016, or 1.6% of the time of one revolution. The relative difference in the speed\nof the satellite between the two points is\n\n\n\n6.6 Appendix: Atmospheric Drag 211\n\nHere we take the planet to be spherical and neglect its rotational speed and\nalso the wind speed compared with the speed of the satellite near perigee.\nWith (4.45), we thus find\n\nV? = V = Vp =\n\n?\n?\n\na\n\n?\n1 + e\n\n1? e .\n\nWe also make the highly reasonable assumption that a and e do not change\nover one revolution.\n\nWe denote the altitude of the satellite by z and its altitude at perigee by\nzp. We also denote the value of ? at perigee by ?p and the scale factor at this\naltitude by H . Over one period of length T , the value ?1V of ?V is then\ngiven by\n\n?1V =\n1\n\n2\nB\n\n? T\n0\n\n?V 2 dt =\n1\n\n2\nB?p\n\n?\n\na\n\n1 + e\n\n1? e\n\n? +T/2\n?T/2\n\nexp\n\n(\n?z ? zp\n\nH\n\n)\ndt . (6.124)\n\nUsing the eccentric anomaly E, we obtain the relations\n\nr = a(1? e cosE) , rp = a(1? e) , z ? zp = r ? rp = ae(1? cosE) .\n\nThe lapse of time over which drag is effective is very short and centered on\nthe passage at perigee. In this case, the anomalies M and E are much smaller\nthan 1. We may thus write\n\n1? cosE ? E\n2\n\n2\n, M = E ? e sinE ? E(1? e) .\n\nThis gives E as a function of M and hence z ? zp as a function of time:\n\nE =\nM\n\n1? e =\n?\n\n?\n\na3\n1\n\n1? e t , (6.125)\n\nz ? zp = ae\nE2\n\n2\n=\n\n1\n\n2\n?\n\ne\n\na2(1? e)2 t\n2 , (6.126)\n\nz ? zp\nH\n\n=\n1\n\n2\n\n?e\n\nHr2p\nt2 . (6.127)\n\nFirst we note that the integral of a Gaussian is? +?\n??\n\nexp\n(\n??x2\n\n)\ndx =\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n.\n\nDuring a revolution of period T occurring between t = ?T/2 and t = +T/2,\ndrag is only really operative near t = 0. It is neither here nor there\n\n?dV\nV\n\n= (2 ? ?)?1 dr\nr\n\n? (1 + e)?1 dh\nr\n\n= 0.033 ,\n\nor 3.3%, and we thus justify treating the speed as constant. The ratio of the atmospheric\ndensities between 600 and 200 km altitude is 10?4.\n\n\n\n212 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nwhether a friction-related quantity is integrated over one period, in the range\n[?T/2,+T/2], or over the range (??,+?). We thus have\n\n? +T/2\n?T/2\n\nexp\n\n(\n?z ? zp\n\nH\n\n)\ndt =\n\n? +?\n??\n\nexp\n\n(\n?1\n2\n\n?e\n\nHr2p\nt2\n)\ndt\n\n=\n\n?\n2?H\n\n?e\nrp , (6.128)\n\nand finally,\n\n?1V =\n\n?\n?\n\n2\nB?p\n\n?\n?\n1 + e?\n\ne\n\n?\nH . (6.129)\n\nThis is a remarkably simple formula, because it only involves the geometry of\nthe ellipse (through e), the scale factor H , and the mass per unit volume ?p\nof the atmosphere at perigee. The semi-major axis a, which enters indirectly\nthrough the period T , and the altitude at perigee, which determines ?p, do\nnot appear explicitly.\n\nThe result can be applied as long as the effective drag time near the passage\nat perigee is small compared with the whole period. This effective drag time\n?teff is defined by\n\n?p?teff =\n\n? +T/2\n?T/2\n\n? dt . (6.130)\n\nWith the assumptions made above, calculation leads to\n\n?teff\nT\n\n=\n\n?\nH\n\n2?a\n\n1? e?\ne\n\n. (6.131)\n\nIf we set the condition ?teff/T < 0.1, with H = 50km, a = 26,500km, we\nobtain the constraint\n\ne > 0.03 ?? (6.129) is applicable .\n\nThis formula is particular useful for the study of atmospheric braking, a tech-\nnique for circularising orbits, although more often used on Mars than on the\nEarth.19 Indeed, it is with Mars missions in mind that we have set out the\nabove theory. We have compared the resulting values of ?1V with those ob-\ntained by stepwise numerical integrations using an atmospheric model (MCD-\nLMD). The error never exceeds 5%.\n\n19For Earth-orbiting satellites, this method is considered for transforming GTO orbits\ninto LEO orbits, in the case of passenger satellites (which thus have little fuel autonomy)\nlaunched with a GEO mission.\n\n\n\n6.7 Historical Note: First Determinations of the Harmonics Jn 213\n\n6.7 Historical Note: First Determinations\n\nof the Harmonics Jn\n\nIt was by monitoring the first satellites (mainly visually, using dedicated\ntelescopes) that astronomers were able to calculate the first coefficients of the\nzonal spherical harmonics, having first determined the exact orbits. Let us give\na brief account of these developments. US astronomers used the Baker\u2013Nun\ncamera, named after its two inventors (see Fig. 6.5).\n\n6.7.1 First Satellite Determination of J2\n\nThe \u201cbeep-beep\u201d sound emitted by Sputnik-1 came as a surprise to the\nworld. Before the scientific community could react, 1957? (the name at-\ntributed to the satellite with the classification of the day, abandoned since\n1 January 1963) had already burnt up in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nMeasurements only began with Sputnik-2 (1957?). With 33 visual obser-\nvations made in the skies of Czechoslovakia between 7 December 1957 and 21\nMarch 1958, the astronomer E. Buchar succeeded in determining the motion\nof the ascending node of the orbit:\n\n?? = ?2.9007\u00b1 0.0046 degrees per day .\n\nThe metric elements of the satellite were determined to be as follows:\n\na/R = 1.1127 , e = 0.0731 , i = 65.29? .\n\nThe period and mean motion are also known:\n\nT = 99.2min , n = 1.0556\u00d7 10?3 rad s?1 .\n\nFig. 6.5 :Baker\u2013Nunn satellite tracking cam-\n\nera telescope.

Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nUsing (6.73), we deduce the value of J2 to be\n\nJ2 = 2.9007/2675.0 = 1.0844\u00d7 10?3 .\n\nThe flattening f can be obtained from (3.33), the first of Clairaut\u2019s equations:\n\nf =\n3J2 +ma\n\n2\n, (6.132)\n\nwhere ma is defined by (3.34) and has known value. Buchar thus obtained\n\n1\n\nf\n= 297.7\u00b1 0.3 .\n\nShortly afterwards, refining the results from Sputnik-2, D. King-Hele obtained\n\n1\n\nf\n= 298.1\u00b1 0.1 .\n\nEstimates of 1/f have barely changed since then, whereas they varied between\n293 and 300 prior to 1958 (see Table 2.1).\n\n6.7.2 First Satellite Determination of J3\n\nWhile J2 is determined from the secular variation of ?, the coefficient\nJ3 is related to the long-period variation of e. The first determination of\nJ3 was made by J.A. O\u2019Keefe from observations of the orbit of Vanguard-1\n(1958?2). The eccentricity e varied sinusoidally with a period of about 80\ndays, corresponding to the cycle of the apsidal line, with duration 2?/?? and\namplitude ?e given by\n\n?e = (42\u00b1 3)\u00d7 10?5 .\n\nAt the beginning of the mission, the orbital characteristics were\n\nhp = 654 km , ha = 3, 969 km , a = 8, 681 km , e = 0.1090 ,\n\ni = 34.25? , T = 134.2min .\n\nThe motion of the perigee is found from ?? = 4.40? per day, implying a cycle\nof 82 days.\n\nThe amplitude of the variation in e is |?LP3e| when we insert ? = 90?\nin (6.94). With ?LP3e = ?e = 42\u00d7 10?5, we obtain\n\nJ3 = ?2J2\n( a\nR\n\n) 1\nsin i\n\n?LP3e = ?4.8424J2?LP3e ? ?2.2\u00d7 10?6 .\n\nThis is close to J3 = ?2.54\u00d7 10?6, the value given in Table 3.2.\n\n\n\n6.8 Historical Note: Success in Calculating Perturbations 215\n\n6.7.3 First Determinations of Jn up to J14\n\nIn 1963, Y. Kozai used observations of the nine US satellites20 launched\nbetween 1959 and 1962 to determine the first 14 coefficients of the zonal har-\nmonics Jn. To do this, he neglected short-period variations and assumed that\nall the long-period variations were modulated by the motion of the perigee,\ni.e., that they varied as ?.\n\nRegarding the metric elements, (6.76) implies\n\ne = e0 +Ae sin? , i = i0 +Ai sin? , (6.133)\n\nwhere Ae and Ai are coefficients depending solely on the metric elements a,\ne, i and the zonal harmonics Jn, which may therefore be treated as constant\nover several revolutions. Restricting to order 3, Ae sin? and Ai sin? are given\nby (6.94) and (6.93), respectively.\n\nRegarding the angle elements, starting from (6.77), he added the periodic\nvariation to the secular variation to obtain\n\n? = ?0 + ??t+A? cos? , (6.134)\n\n? = ?0 + ??t+A? cos? . (6.135)\n\nGiven the theoretical dependence of the coefficients Ae, Ai, A?, and A? on\nthe first 14 Jn, these observations provided dozens of equations that could be\nsolved numerically.\n\n6.8 Historical Note: Success in Calculating\n\nPerturbations\n\nTwo astronomers, Clairaut in the eighteenth century and Le Verrier in the\nnineteenth, were particularly successful in calculating perturbations, while\nEinstein solved the \u201cmystery\u201d of the advance of the perihelion of the planet\nMercury in the twentieth century.\n\n6.8.1 The Delayed Return of Halley\u2019s Comet\n\nIn 1705, in Cometographia, the astronomer Halley21 described the orbits\nof 24 comets. Applying the new theory by Newton, he calculated their orbital\n\n20These satellites had orbits with a wide range of inclinations, from 28? to 95?. They\nwere, in chronological order: 1959? (Vanguard-2), 1959? (Vanguard-3), 1960?2 (rocket which\nlaunched Echo-1), 1961? (Explorer-12), 1961o (Transit-4A), 1961??1 (Midas-4), 1962??\n(Discoverer-34), 1962?? (ANNA-1B), 1962?? (Relay-1). All these orbits were determined\nby tracking them with Baker\u2013Nunn cameras.\n\n21Edmund Halley (1656\u20131742) was a British astronomer. Although he is remembered for\nhis discovery of the periodicity of a comet, Halley was an all-round scientist. He visited Saint\nHelena to draw up the first map of the southern skies. During his travels on the ocean, he\n\n\n\n216 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nelements and asserted that several comets with the same elements were in fact\none and the same comet, having a period of 76 years. After a passage in 1682,\nhe predicted a further passage in 1758, and the comet was later named after\nhim.\n\nAs the time of the predicted return drew close, the whole astronomi-\ncal community was on tenterhooks. In 1757, the astronomer mathematician\nClairaut suggested that Jupiter might significantly perturb the comet. He\nwanted to calculate the effects22 before the date announced, and hence ac-\nquired the services of two young astronomers, Je?ro?me Lalande23 and Nicole-\nReine Lepaute, recognised for their calculational skills. After exhausting work\n\u201cagainst the clock\u201d, they concluded that, as a result of Jupiter and Sat-\nurn\u2019s gravitational perturbations, the comet would not reach its perihelion\nin November 1758, as the now deceased Halley had predicted, but rather in\nApril 1759 (with an error of 1 month). In the end, the comet returned to\nperigee on 13 March 1759.\n\nThese calculations, which Clairaut presented in The?orie du mouvement des\ncome?tes (1760), convincingly confirmed Newton\u2019s theory. It should be noted\nthat Lagrange only published his theory of perturbations some 28 years later.\n\n6.8.2 The Discovery of Neptune by Le Verrier\n\nThe most spectacular application of the theory of perturbations was the\ndiscovery of a new planet, Neptune, by Le Verrier.24 The planet Uranus had\nbeen discovered in 1781 by Herschel. In 1844, Le Verrier studied its orbit\n(over an arc of 270?: it had a period of 84 years, and had been discovered\n\nproduced a detailed chart of the magnetic declination, measured the period of a pendulum\nat different latitudes, investigated ocean currents, and studied the distribution of winds to\nproduce a forerunner of the weather chart. Halley also translated several books of geometry\nby Apollonius of Perga from Arabic, the original Greek versions having been lost.\n\n22\u201cEven if Clairaut had wished to follow Halley\u2019s example in assuming that one might\nneglect the effects of Jupiter on the comet during the years when these bodies were widely\nremoved from one another, it did not take him long to understand that such a position\nwas untenable. Indeed, the first calculations showed that, even when the comet is far from\nJupiter, its orbit is nevertheless disturbed, especially by the action of Jupiter on the Sun;\nfor by displacing the Sun by a small amount, Jupiter gives the orbit of the planet a different\nfocus. Clairaut determined all these effects with great elegance.\u201d Pierre Brunet, La vie et\nl\u2019\u0153uvre de Clairaut, 1952.\n\n23Joseph Je?ro?me Lefranc?ais de Lalande, or Je?ro?me Lalande for short (1732\u20131807), was a\nFrench astronomer. He was spotted very early on for the accuracy of his observations, e.g.,\nhis measurement of the parallax of the Moon (1751), and the parallax of the Sun during the\ntransit of Venus in 1761 and 1769. He also studied the rotation of the Sun and the shape of\nthe Earth. He was famous in his own time, perhaps even the first high profile astronomer,\nnoted for his skills as a teacher and populariser of science. And he was also an outspoken\natheist, declaring: \u201cWe know nothing. We believe in miracles and witchcraft, we are afraid\nof thunder and spiders, and all we think to do is believe in God.\u201d\n\n24Urbain Le Verrier (1811\u20131877) was a French astronomer who remains famous for his\nmathematical discovery of the planet Neptune. He subsequently devoted himself to the the-\nory of the Solar System and the calculation of ephemerides.

Their values were obtained by solving a system of 33 equations, each\ncorresponding to one observation.\n\nIn August 1846, he announced that he had located the planet, specify-\ning a = 36.15 a.u., e = 0.108, and distance from the Sun = 33.06 a.u. (for\nthe Titius\u2013Bode theory and the orbital elements of Neptune, see Chap. 16).\nHe provided accurate coordinates and, on 23 September 1846, the German\nastronomer Galle claimed to have identified a new planet at precisely the\npoint indicated, using his telescope at the Berlin observatory.26 It was named\nNeptune soon afterwards.\n\nLe Verrier\u2019s success27 drew astronomy, and science in general, into the\nlimelight. Arago recorded these events with the famous remark: \u201cM. Le Ver-\nrier found a new planet at the nib of his pen.\u201d But even Le Verrier was unable\nto explain the advance of the perihelion of Mercury with the theory of per-\nturbations, as we shall see below.\n\n6.8.3 Advance of the Perihelion of Mercury\n\nIn 1859, Le Verrier studied the effects of perturbations on the planet Mer-\ncury using observations made since 1697 (mainly 397 meridian observations\nmade at the Paris observatory between 1801 and 1842). Mercury\u2019s orbit is\n\nOn 14 November 1854, a hurricane destroyed part of the French and allied navies in\nthe Crimean war. Le Verrier realised that this storm had crossed Europe from west to east\nand set up the first network of weather stations in 1855.\n\n25In fact, Le Verrier also used observations made earlier, for astronomers had realised\nthat the planet Uranus had already been spotted in the sky as early as 1690, and taken\nfor a star. For his calculations, he used 7 observations made prior to 1781 and 26 made\nafterwards.\n\n26Tisserand devoted the whole of Chap. XXIII in Vol. 1 of his Me?canique ce?leste to the\ndiscovery of Neptune by Le Verrier, ending with the declaration: \u201cM. Galle observed the\nplanet at just 52? from the assigned position.\u201d Note that, on 2 July 2011, Neptune had\ncompleted a full revolution, i.e., 60,182 days after 23 September 1846, whence the planet\nwas then located at precisely the position where Galle had first observed it.\n\n27The astronomer J.C. Adams claimed to have obtained the same results simultaneously.\nHowever, this was never clearly confirmed. The whole episode seems to be yet another story\nof rivalry between British and French scientists.\n\n\n\n218 Chapter 6.

Newtonian mechanics can predict the mo-\ntion of its perihelion (apsidal precession) due to the perturbing effects of the\nother planets. By taking into account all these planetary perturbations, Le\nVerrier arrived at a value of 531?? per century. But measurements gave 574??,\nleaving a discrepancy of 43??. The US astronomer Simon Newcomb obtained\nthe same results in 1882.\n\nTo fully appreciate the accuracy of the measurements at the time (see\nTable 6.5), it is instructive to compare these 43?? with the precession of the\nequinoxes of the Earth, which is some 5,026?? per tropical century (for the\nvalue measured from Earth is the sum of all these effects).\n\nIn 1889, F. Tisserand ended his monumental work Traite? de Me?canique\nCe?leste with the statement that the advance of the perihelion of Mercury was\nthe greatest enigma of the day. He refuted all other explanations that had\nbeen put forward:\n\n\u2022 Le Verrier had tried to explain the discrepancy by the presence of a hypo-\nthetical planet between Mercury and the Sun. A name had already been\nfound for it: Vulcan.\n\n\u2022 Newcomb thought the disagreement might be due to the non-sphericity of\nthe Sun.\n\n\u2022 Hall had even called the laws of gravity into question, suggesting an at-\ntractive force going rather as r?2.000000151.\n\nOne sees the extent to which this unexplained discrepancy was an enigma to\nthe most brilliant astronomers. F. Tisserand concludes with the words:\n\nOne might think that the attractions between celestial bodies could only be trans-\nmitted over distance through the mediation of some kind of medium. But as yet we\nknow nothing of these modes of transmission.\n\n\n\n6.8 Historical Note: Success in Calculating Perturbations 219\n\nIt was Einstein28 who, in 1916, came up with the explanation, applying his\nnew theory of general relativity. Expressing the equation of motion in this\ncontext (the geodesic equation for planetary trajectories, as determined by\nthe Schwarzschild metric), the classical equation (4.24) is replaced by\n\nd2u\n\nd?2\n+ u =\n\n?\n\nC2\n+\n\n3?\n\nc2\nu2 , (6.136)\n\nwhere C is the angular momentum per unit mass and c is the speed of light.\nEquation (6.136) is a differential equation for the Binet variable u, but it has\nno analytic solution. However, we know that the desired solution for u is very\nclose to u0, the solution of (4.24). We may thus replace u by u0 in the extra\nterm in (6.136). Considering small values for the eccentricity of the orbit, we\nwrite\n\nu =\n?\n\nC2\n[\n1 + e cos(? ? ?0)\n\n]\n, u2 ? ?\n\n2\n\nC4\n[\n1 + 2e cos(? ? ?0)\n\n]\n,\n\nwhence (6.136) becomes\n\nd2u\n\nd?2\n+ u =\n\n?\n\nC2\n\n{\n1 + ?\n\n[\n1 + 2e cos(? ? ?0)\n\n]}\n, (6.137)\n\nwith the dimensionless number ? defined by\n\n? = 3\n( ?\ncC\n\n)2\n, ? ? 1 . (6.138)\n\nWe seek u in the form\n\nu =\n?\n\nC2\n\n{\n1 + e cos\n\n[\n(1? ?)? ? ?0\n\n]}\n, (6.139)\n\nand then check that it does indeed solve (6.137). The desired trajectory is\nthus given by\n\nr(?) =\na(1? e2)\n\n1 + e cos\n[\n(1 ? ?)? ? ?0\n\n] , (6.140)\nwhere r = 1/u. This should be compared with (4.42).\n\n28Albert Einstein (1879\u20131955) was a German (then Swiss, then American) physicist. He\nentered upon the academic scene with brilliance in 1905, his annus mirabilis, with three fun-\ndamental, and indeed revolutionary, publications: Brownian motion (the size of molecules),\nthe photoelectric effect (the particle nature of light), and the special theory of relativ-\nity (modification of Newtonian mechanics and the equivalence of matter and energy). The\nthree papers appeared in Annalen der Physik, which was edited at the time by Max Planck.\nFrom 1915, he developed his theory of gravity and the general theory of relativity. The field\nequations are differential equations which describe the behaviour of the gravitational field,\nrepresented by the spacetime metric, in terms of the distribution of matter and energy.\nEuclidean space must be replaced by a Riemannian space that is \u201ccurved\u201d by the masses\nlocated within it. Einstein\u2019s theories form the basis of modern physics.\n\n\n\n220 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nTwo successive passages at perihelion determine the polar angles ?1 and\n?2.

He noted that, with so many perturbations around,\nirregularities will be \u201capt to increase, till this System wants a Reformation\u201d.\nHe clearly felt that some divine intervention would be required from time to\ntime to put things straight once more.\n\nWith the help of observations made by the Chaldeans in the second century\nbc and transmitted by Ptolemy, Halley calculated that Jupiter was moving\ncloser to the Sun, while Saturn was moving away. In 1752, Euler, and in 1774,\n\n29The advance of the perihelion also occurs for other planets, but it is all the weaker\nas the planet is more remote from the Sun (whence it moves less quickly in a Copernican\nframe). For example, we observe 8??.63 per century for Venus, 3??.84 for the Earth, and 1??.35\nfor Mars. For the Moon, in its motion relative to the Earth, it is 2?? per century. All these\nvalues can be calculated using (6.12).\n\n\n\n6.9 Astronomical Note: Perturbations and the Solar System 221\n\nLagrange also tackled this problem. Their results were contradictory, and in\nfact both their calculations were erroneous, but they nevertheless marked the\nbeginnings of perturbative investigations.\n\nLaplace30 returned to these calculations in 1776. He showed that the semi-\nmajor axis of each orbit was constant: a has no secular term, at least not in the\nfirst order expansion of the perturbations. He deduced that the Solar System\nwould be stable for a million years. He calculated that the quasi-resonance 5:2\nbetween the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn would cause an oscillation\nof the longitude of Saturn by 46?50??, with a period of 900 years, and thus\nrecovered the values given by Halley. For Laplace, this stability of the major\naxes was a definitive confirmation of Newton\u2019s laws (Fig. 6.6).\n\nIn 1890, Poisson showed that a does not have a second order secular term\neither.\n\nStability of the Solar System\n\nIn 1856, Le Verrier considered that, if Laplace\u2019s results were to remain\nvalid over very long times, it would be necessary to consider higher order\nexpansions. However, Poincare?31 understood that the method suggested by\nLe Verrier was not correct. In his thesis presented in 1879, he showed that\nthe terms of the series expansions used in the perturbative method do not\n\n30Pierre Simon de Laplace (1749\u20131827) was a French mathematician, astronomer, and\nphysicist. Noting that all the observable bodies in the Solar System rotate in the same\ndirection (he included the 29 revolutions or rotations of planets and moons, and even the\nrotation of the Sun itself), and taking the cue from Herschel\u2019s observations of the nebulas,\nhe devised a first cosmogonic system in Exposition du syste?me du Monde (first edition in\n1796 and fifth in 1824). According to this view, the Solar System and all other objects\nin the universe were produced by the condensation of a primordial nebula, the preferred\nhypothesis even today. During cooling, the rotation of this nebula would have generated\na succession of rings in the same plane (the ecliptic), and these would have given birth to\nthe planets and their moons, with the central nucleus becoming the Sun. In his Me?canique\nce?leste (first edition in 1798 and sixth in 1825), he revisited all the theories elaborated since\nNewton. Victor Hugo had this to say (V. Hugo, Choses vues, 1887):\n\nM. Arago had a favourite anecdote. When Laplace published his Me?canique ce?leste,\nhe would say, the Emperor Napoleon summoned him. The emperor was furious.\n\u2014 What, he cried when he saw Laplace, you make a whole system of the world, you\nlist the laws of all creation, and yet in your book you speak not once of the existence\nof God!\n\u2014 Sire, replied Laplace, I had no need of that hypothesis.\n\nIn the two centuries from Kepler to Laplace, the relationship between astronomers and\nthe divine order had changed considerably. Laplace also established fundamental results\nin mathematics (harmonic functions, differential equations, probabilities) and in physics\n(electromagnetism, thermodynamics).\n\n31Henri Poincare? (1854\u20131912) was a French mathematician. He studied the changes of\nvariables that preserve the canonical form of the equations of mechanics (with the Jacobi\nformulation). He thus arrived at quite novel results in Sur le proble?me a? trois corps et les\ne?quations de la dynamique (1889). He further developed this work in Les me?thodes nouvelles\nde la me?canique ce?leste (1899).\n\n\n\n222 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nFig. 6.6 :Laplace\u2019s two fundamental works on astronomy.\n\nconverge over the time lapse under consideration. For a dynamical system\ninvolving three or more bodies, he showed that the solution depends strongly\non the initial conditions\u2014in modern terms it is chaotic (chaos theory). Then\naround 1960, the problem was investigated in the light of the Kolmogorov\u2013\nArnold\u2013Moser (KAM) theory.\n\nSince 1990, J. Laskar at the Paris observatory has been using methods\nadapted to the increasing performance of computer calculations. For his nu-\nmerical simulations, he considers initial conditions32 that differ very slightly\nfrom one another. In his last report (2010), he showed that in 99% of cases the\nSolar System will remain stable for 5 billion years (5Gyr), i.e., without colli-\nsions. In 1% of cases, there is some form of instability: through its increased\neccentricity, Mercury collides with the Sun or Venus and thereby destabilises\nthe orbits of all the inner planets (as far out as Mars).\n\nThe Solar System had a major period of instability just after its formation,\nduring about the first billion years, no doubt due to the migrations of the\ngiant planets. Then, once the eight major planets were in place, it became\npractically stable.\n\n32Initial conditions refer to the positions of the bodies making up the Solar System at the\npresent time. J. Laskar has considered 2,500 very similar sets of conditions. He has shown\nthat the error in the position is multiplied by a factor of 10 every 10 million years (10Myr).\nFor example, an error of 15m becomes an uncertainty of 1,500 km after 50Myr and 1 a.u.\n(astronomical unit) after 100Myr.\n\n\n\n6.9 Astronomical Note: Perturbations and the Solar System 223\n\n6.9.2 Precession of the Equinoxes\n\nA simplified model of the terrestrial ellipsoid is given by a sphere with an\nequatorial bulge. The mass of this bulge, uniformly distributed around the\nequator, is such that the moments of inertia Ix with respect to an equatorial\ndiameter and Iz with respect to the polar axis are the same as for the ellipsoid.\nThis is a standard method for calculating the precession of the equinoxes.\n\nIf the Earth were a sphere composed of homogeneous concentric layers, the\ngravitational effect exerted by the bodies of the Solar System, and in particular\nthe Moon and Sun, would reduce to a force through its center. The Earth\u2019s\nmotion would then be a uniform motion around a fixed axis. The equatorial\nplane would be fixed relative to the plane of the ecliptic. The straight line at\nthe intersection of these two planes, the line of nodes (called here the line of\nthe equinoxes), would thus be fixed with respect to a Copernican frame.\n\nLet us consider the bulging Earth model. As the precessional motion here is\nvery slow compared with the Moon\u2019s revolutions, or the apparent revolutions\nof the Sun around the Earth, we may replace the Moon and the Sun by an\nequivalent mass distribution along their orbits, considered as circular, in the\nplane of the ecliptic (which is an approximation for the Moon). This is Gauss\u2019\nmethod.33 It can be shown (using Lagrange and Poisson\u2019s theory of motion\nwith the gyroscopic approximation) that the moment of the gravitational\nforces exerted by the mass of the Sun and Moon on this equatorial bulge\ncauses a motion of the Earth\u2019s axis of rotation, whilst the angle between the\nequatorial and ecliptic planes remains fixed. This angle ? is the obliquity. The\nline of nodes moves in the retrograde direction (opposite to the direction of\nthe Earth\u2019s rotation). This motion, known as the precession of the equinoxes,\nis very slow on the human time scale: one round trip every 25,800 year, or\n50??.29 per year, with the Moon contributing 34?? and the Sun 16??. The angular\nmomentum and hence the rate of precession is proportional to the difference\nIx ? Iz between the moments of inertia, related to the J2 term. The rate of\nprecession is also proportional to cos ?.\n\nThe precession of the equinoxes has been known since ancient times, thanks\nto Hipparchos.34\n\n33In 1818, Gauss published a monograph on the secular perturbations of a planet\u2019s motion\nwhen it is affected by another planet. The method consists in replacing the perturbing body\nby a torus, distributing the matter of the body along its trajectory.\n\n34Hipparchos of Nicaea (second century bc), ? -.??????\t? ??, was a Greek astronomer.\nBy his observations made in Rhodes, he was the first astronomer to make truly accurate\nmeasurements of the positions of the stars, specifying their positions on the celestial sphere\nusing meridians and parallels. He introduced into Greece the Babylonian idea of dividing\nthe circle into degrees, minutes, and seconds. He may be considered as the inventor of\ntrigonometry. He invented the stereographic projection. He discovered the precession of\nthe equinoxes by comparing his measurements of stellar positions with those made by\nTimocharis a century and a half earlier, and also with those made much earlier by the\nBabylonians. The works of Hipparchos did not reach us directly, but were mentioned by the\ngeographer Strabo and the astronomer Ptolemy.\n\n\n\n224 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nPrecession of the Line of Nodes of a Satellite\n\nWith the same type of argument, one can calculate approximately the\nprecessional motion of the circular orbit of a satellite. Consider a satellite in\ncircular orbit around the Earth with its equatorial bulge. We distribute the\nmass of the satellite uniformly around its trajectory (the rate of precession\nis roughly one ten thousandth of the orbital angular speed of the satellite)\nand calculate the moment of the gravitational forces between these two rings.\nWe then show that the orbit undergoes a precessional motion in which the\nangle between the orbital plane of the satellite and the equatorial plane of\nthe Earth (the inclination i of the satellite) remains constant. We calculate\nthe moment of the gravitational forces, then the rate of precession ??, which\nis proportional to Ix ? Iz , hence to J2 and cos i.\n\n6.9.3 The Earth as a Satellite\n\nOrbital Elements of the Earth\n\nOne can use the analogy between an artificial satellite in orbit around the\nEarth and the Earth viewed as a satellite of the Sun. But let us first note a\nbasic difference between the two problems:\n\n\u2022 The artificial satellite is considered as a point with respect to the Earth and\nits Keplerian motion is mainly perturbed by the flattening of the attracting\nbody (via the J2 term of the Earth).\n\n\u2022 As a satellite of the Sun, the Earth cannot be treated as a point, but must\nbe considered as a rotating solid, whose polar axis of rotation defines the\nequatorial plane, and whose non-spherical nature (the J2 term of the Earth)\ninduces perturbations. The Sun is spherical.35 To these perturbations, one\nmust add those due to the Moon.\n\nThe Keplerian orbital elements of the Earth are as follows:\n\n\u2022 a is the semi-major axis of the Earth\u2019s orbit, aS = 1 astronomical unit.\n\u2022 e is the eccentricity of the orbit, e = 0.0167.\n\u2022 i is represented here by the obliquity ?, the angle between the plane of the\n\necliptic (orbital plane of the Earth) and the equatorial plane of the Earth.\n\u2022 ? is the angle between the line of nodes (the line of the equinoxes, direction\n\nof the vernal point) and an arbitrary origin, fixed relative to the stars.\n\u2022 ? is the angle between the direction of the vernal point and the perihelion\n\n(at the present time, the Earth passes through the vernal point on 21 March\nand the perihelion on 3 January, dates of the Gregorian calendar, accurate\nto within 1 day).\n\n\u2022 The effect on M ? nt is not considered here.\n\n35Current theories give the Sun\u2019s J2 value at about 2\u00d7 10?7.\n\n\n\n6.9 Astronomical Note: Perturbations and the Solar System 225\n\nVariations of the Orbital Elements\n\nPerturbations affect these elements as shown schematically in Fig. 6.4.\nShort-period variations are neglected:\n\nMetric Elements. For these elements, there is no secular variation:\n\n\u2022 Invariability of the semi-major axis a (stability of the major axes, studied\nby Laplace, Poisson, Poincare?, as discussed above).\n\n\u2022 Long-period variation for e and ?. e varies between 0.005 and 0.050, with\na period of 1,00,000 year and ? varies between 22? and 25?, with a period\nof 40,000 year.\n\nAngle Elements. For these elements, there are secular variations for ? and\n?. ? has a retrograde cycle36 of 25,800 year, or ?? = ?50??.29 per year,\ncalled precession of the equinoxes. ? has a prograde cycle of 110,000 years, or\n?? = 11??.06 per year.\n\nThese variations are shown schematically in Fig. 6.7 (upper) for each orbital\nelement, noting the value of the period or cycle as appropriate. Time is shown\non the horizontal axis in units of kiloyears (1 kyr = 103 year). The zero time\nis chosen arbitrarily at the moment when each element has its average value.\n\nMilankovitch Paleoclimatology Theory\n\nThe Milankovitch theory considers the combination of these periods (100\nand 40 kyr) and cycles (26 and 110 kyr) in order to explain the succession of\nhot and cold periods (ice ages) of the Earth\u2019s past climate. Taken up in 1980\nby A. Berger, this theory obtained a striking experimental confirmation with\nthe analysis of air bubbles trapped in the Greenland and Antarctic ice over a\nperiod of 8,00,000 year in samples taken to a depth of 3,260m.\n\nIn the Milankovitch theory, the main variable is the climate parameter P\ndefined by\n\nP = e sin?0 , (6.142)\n\nwhere ?0 is the position of the perigee relative to the spring equinox (ascending\nnode or vernal point):\n\n?0 = ? ?? . (6.143)\n\nNote that the two angles ? and ? are defined in different planes making an\nangle i = ? (the obliquity) to one another. Their difference ?0, called the\n\n36A cycle is the length of time at the end of which the relevant point on the orbit (the\nvernal point or the perigee) returns to the same position relative to a Copernican frame.\nThe cycle relates to a secular variation. For long- or short-period variations, we speak of\nthe period.\n\n\n\n226 Chapter 6.

Here we list the definition and year of application of the\nunit for each of the first three quantities (the only ones relevant to celestial\nmechanics):\n\n\u2022 The unit of length, the meter, is the distance travelled by light in vacuum37\nduring a time lapse of 1/299,792,458s (1983).\n\n\u2022 The unit of mass, the kilogram, is the mass of the International Prototype\nKilogram, made from a platinum\u2013iridium alloy and stored at the Interna-\ntional Bureau of Weights and Measures (Bureau International des Poids et\nMesures BIPM) in Paris (1889, 1901).\n\n\u2022 The unit of time, the second, is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770\nperiods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two\nhyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom (1967).\n\nAstronomical System of Units\n\nThe base units of the astronomical system, as recommended by the Inter-\nnational Astronomical Union (IAU), are as follows:\n\n\u2022 The unit of length is the astronomical unit (a.u.), a conventional unit of\nlength equal to exactly 149,597,870,700m. This value has been chosen to\nbe consistent with that in the IAU System of astronomical constants in use\nsince 2009. This definition has to be used with all time scales such as TCB,\n\n37Time can now be measured much more accurately than length. For this reason, it was\ndecided to define the unit of length on the basis of a time measurement. The speed of light\nis thus given now as a definite value, with zero error by definition.\n\n\n\n228 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nTDB, TCG, TT, etc. The unique symbol to be used for the astronomical\nunit is a.u. (IAU 2012 resolution B2).38\n\n\u2022 The unit of mass is the mass of the Sun MS.\n\u2022 The unit of time is the day (d).\n\nThe correspondence between these and SI units is as follows:\n\n1 a.u. = 1.495978707\u00d7 1011 m ,\n1 MS = 1.9889\u00d7 1030 kg ,\n1 d = 86,400 s .\n\nAuxiliary time units are the Julian year, equal to 365.25 days, and the Julian\ncentury, equal to 36,525 days. The length of the year or century is not related\nto the Gregorian calendar. The length of the day is not related to the rotation\nof the Earth, which is not strictly uniform.\n\n6.10.2 Astronomical Constants\n\nTable 6.6 lists the IAU 2009 constants, including changes to the astronom-\nical unit made in IAU 2012. We have only mentioned constants used in this\nbook.\n\nNote. For some of these constants relating to geodesy, such as Re, J2, or ?,\nthere is a very slight difference between these values and the ones used in the\ngeopotential models.\n\n6.10.3 Time Scales\n\nDefinitions of Time Scales\n\nThe following is taken from the Standards of Fundamental Astronomy\n(SOFA) document on time scales, published by the IAU. Several time scales\nplay an important role in astronomy39:\n\n\u2022 TAI (International Atomic Time): the official timekeeping standard.\n\u2022 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time): the basis of civil time.\n\u2022 UT1 (Universal Time): based on Earth rotation.\n\u2022 TT (Terrestrial Time): used for Solar System ephemeris look-up.\n\n38The old definition of the astronomical unit was that length for which the Gaussian\ngravitational constant k takes the value of 0.017,202,098,95 when the units of measurements\nare the astronomical unit of length, mass, and time. The dimensions of k2 are those of the\nconstant of gravitation G, i.e., L3M?1T?2. Equivalently, it is the radius of an unperturbed\ncircular Newtonian orbit about the Sun of a particle having infinitesimal mass, moving with\nan angular frequency of 0.017,202,098,95 radians per day.\n\n39For the notation and abbreviations, see the appendix in Sect. 3.6.\n\n\n\n6.10 Appendix: Astronomical Constants 229\n\nQuantity Value Uncertainty Unit\n\nNatural defining constants\n\nSpeed of light (c) 2.99792458 \u00d7 108 Defined ms?1\n\nAuxiliary defining constants\n\nAstronomical unit (a.u.) 149,597,870,700 Defined m\n\n1? dTT/dTCG (LG) 6.969290134 \u00d7 10?10 Defined \u2013\n1? dTDB/dTCB (LB) 1.550519768 \u00d7 10?8 Defined \u2013\nERA at J2000.0 (?0) 0.7790572732640 Defined Rev\nRate of advance ERA 1.00273781191135448 Defined Revd?1\n\nNatural measurable constants\n\nCst. of gravitation (G) 6.67428 \u00d7 10?11 6.7\u00d7 10?15 m3kg?1s?2\n\nBody constants\n\nHelioc. grav. cst.

Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nAtomic Time: TAI. TAI is a laboratory time scale, independent of astro-\nnomical phenomena. It is realized through a changing population of about 200\nhigh-precision atomic clocks.\n\nSolar Time: UT1 and UTC. UT1 is defined through its relationship with\nthe Earth rotation angle (the modern equivalent of mean solar time). Because\nthe Earth\u2019s rotation rate is slightly irregular, for geophysical reasons, and is\ngradually decreasing, the UT1 second is not precisely matched to the SI sec-\nond. In fundamental physics, the TAI second is used, but to point a telescope,\nUT1 is used. UTC is a compromise between the demands of precise timekeep-\ning and the desire to maintain the current relationship between civil time and\ndaylight.\n\nThe origin of TAI is taken equal to UT1 on 1 January 1958. As a clock, the\nEarth has got behind the accumulated atomic time by some 35 s (as of 2013).\nWhen TAI was adopted, it was decided that the unit of time of the UTC\nscale would be the TAI second, but that UTC should not be allowed to drift\naway indefinitely from the time determined by the Earth\u2019s rotation. It was\nthus decided that, while running with the TAI second, UTC should be shifted\nby 1 s whenever necessary, in such a way that its difference from UT1 should\nnever exceed 0.9 s:\n\nTAI?UTC = n seconds , n integer , (6.145)\n\nUT1?UTC ? 0.9 s .\n\nDynamical Time Scales: TT, TCG, TCB, and TDB. Terrestrial time\n(TT) is the time scale used for geocentric ephemerides. Its unit of time is the\nSI second on the geoid, and TT can thus be deduced from TAI by a simple\nfixed time shift:\n\nTT = TAI + 32.184 s . (6.146)\n\nRelativity theory and today\u2019s observational accuracy require a distinction to\nbe made between the dynamical time scales: coordinate time scale (of 4D\nspacetime) and proper time scale.\n\nGeocentric coordinate time (TCG), related to the center of the Earth,\ndiffers from terrestrial time (TT) by a secular term:\n\nTCG? TT = LG(J ? 2443144.5)\u00d7 86,400 s , (6.147)\n\nwhere J is the Julian day (JD). 1 January 1977, 0 h, corresponds to JD =\n2, 443, 144.5. The coefficient LG is defined in Table 6.6. The value of this term,\nwhich represents the influence of the geopotential and the daily rotation of\nthe Earth on the flow of time, is evaluated in Chap. 14 (see the appendix in\nSect. 14.11). This secular variation leads to a drift of 2.2 s per century.\n\nThe barycentric time scales TCB and TDB are not relevant to this book.\n\n\n\n6.11 Appendix: Gravitational Sphere of Influence 231\n\nHistorical Note on Time Scales\n\nPrior to 1960, the definition of the second was based on the Earth\u2019s rota-\ntion: one mean solar day was equal to 86,400 s. The time scale was Universal\nTime (UT). Between 1960 and 1967, to get around the fact that there were\nirregularities in the Earth\u2019s rotation, the orbital motion of the Earth was cho-\nsen to define the second, which thus became a fraction of the tropical year\n1900. This time scale was Ephemeris Time (ET).\n\nThe year 1967 was historically important in this respect, because it was\nat this point that the definition of time left the field of astronomy to be taken\nover by the world of physics. The second was defined as the period of a certain\ntype of radiation emitted by the caesium 133 atom.\n\n6.11 Appendix: Gravitational Sphere\n\nof Influence\n\n6.11.1 Attraction of the Sun and Earth\n\nIt is easy to understand why a low-orbiting satellite should feel only the\nEarth\u2019s attraction, since the Sun\u2019s attraction is extremely weak. But one must\nask how far out one may continue to ignore the influence of this third body.\nIn the following, we shall define the radius of the sphere beyond which we\nmay consider that a satellite of the Earth escapes to become a satellite of the\nSun. The idea of the sphere of gravitational influence was developed by the\nastronomer F. Tisserand.40\n\nConsider three points A (Sun), B (Earth), C (satellite). The gravitational\nconstant is ?S for the Sun and ? for the Earth. Consider the special case when\nC lies between A and B, with the three bodies forming a straight line. We set\n\nr = CB , satellite\u2013Earth distance ,\n\naS = AB , Sun\u2013Earth distance ,\n\naS ? r = CA , satellite\u2013Sun distance .\nConsider now the reduced (dimensionless) variables k and x defined by\n\nk =\n?S\n?\n\n, x =\nr\n\naS\n. (6.148)\n\nNote that k ? 1 and x ? 1. For the values of the astronomical quantities,\nsee the appendix in Sect. 6.10 and Table 6.6.\n\n40Fe?lix Franc?ois Tisserand (1845\u20131896) was a French astronomer. He continued Delau-\nnay\u2019s work on the motion of the Moon and contributed to the Catalogue photographique\nde la carte du ciel. He then published his Traite? de me?canique ce?leste, in four volumes\n(1889\u20131896), in the spirit of Laplace\u2019s work. See also the historical note on the advance of\nthe perihelion of Mercury.\n\n\n\n232 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nSatellite Close to Earth\n\nThe main acceleration here is the central acceleration ?CCC, which we shall\nwrite ?T0 , due to the Earth (Keplerian motion):\n\n?T0 =\n?\n\nr2\n. (6.149)\n\nThe perturbing acceleration for the satellite is the differential attraction ?CS,\nhere denoted by ?T1 , due to the Sun:\n\n?T1 =\n?S\n\n(aS ? r)2\n? ?S\n\na2S\n. (6.150)\n\nIn the expression for ?T1 , the first term refers to the satellite and the second\nto the Earth (since the Sun acts on the satellite and on the Earth). Since r is\nsmall compared with aS, we obtain\n\n?T1 ?\n?S\na2S\n\n[(\n1 +\n\nr\n\naS\n\n)2\n? 1\n]\n? 2?S\n\na3S\nr . (6.151)\n\nThe ratio of the accelerations is\n\nQT =\n?T1\n?T0\n\n= 2\n?S\n?\n\n(\nr\n\naS\n\n)3\n= 2kx3 . (6.152)\n\nNote. By bringing in the expression for the periods, we obtain\n\nQT = 2\n?S/a\n\n3\nS\n\n?/r3\n= 2\n\n(\nT0\nTS\n\n)2\n, (6.153)\n\nwhere T0 is the Keplerian period of the satellite around the Earth and TS is\nthe period of revolution of the Earth around the Sun, i.e., TS = 1y.\n\nSatellite Far from the Earth\n\nIf a satellite is very far from Earth, so that it is in fact a space probe, the\nEarth\u2019s attraction becomes very small compared with the Sun\u2019s. The central\nacceleration due to the Sun can be written\n\n?S0 =\n?S\n\n(aS ? r)2\n? ?S\n\na2S\n, (6.154)\n\nfor even in this case, r is small compared with aS. The perturbing acceleration\nfor the satellite is the differential attraction due to the Earth, viz.,\n\n?S1 =\n?\n\nr2\n? ?\n\na2S\n? ?\n\nr2\n. (6.155)\n\nThe ratio of the accelerations is\n\nQS =\n?S1\n?S0\n\n=\n?\n\n?S\n\n(aS\nr\n\n)2\n=\n\n1\n\nkx2\n. (6.156)\n\n\n\n6.11 Appendix: Gravitational Sphere of Influence 233\n\n6.11.2 Determining the Sphere of Influence\n\nSphere of Influence as Defined by Tisserand\n\nThe Earth\u2019s sphere of influence ? is a sphere centered on the Earth with\nradius ?? defined by the point on the straight line joining the Sun and Earth\nsuch that QT = QS. This gives\n\n2k2x5 = 1 , (6.157)\n\nor41\n\n?? = 2\n?1/5\n\n(\n?\n\n?S\n\n)2/5\naS . (6.158)\n\nFor the Earth, one finds\n\n?? = 5.4\u00d7 10?3aS = 0.81\u00d7 106 km ,\n??\nR\n\n= 126 ,\n\nusing the numerical values of the astronomical quantities ?S, the heliocentric\ngravitational constant, and aS, the astronomical unit. It is thus possible to\ntreat r as small compared with aS.\n\nAt the end of the book, we will apply this notion to other planets or\ncelestial bodies than the Earth. For the planets of the Solar System, the\nvalues of ?? are given in Table 16.2b.\n\nSphere of Influence: Simplified Definition\n\nAnother definition of the sphere of influence, denoted by ?0, adopts the\ncondition QT = 1, which corresponds to\n\n2kx3 = 1 . (6.159)\n\n41This demonstration is schematic insofar as we are considering the case of three bodies\nlying along a straight line. The full proof due to Tisserand shows that the surface we seek\nhere is given by\n\n?? = ??(?) =\n\n[(\n?\n\n?S\n\n)2 1?\n1 + 3 cos2 ?\n\n]1/5\naS ,\n\nwhere the polar axis is the straight line Earth\u2013Sun with origin at the center of the Earth.\nWhen ? = 0, we retrieve (6.158). This surface of revolution around the polar axis differs\nonly slightly from a sphere, since the polar radius varies by a factor of 1 to 0.87 (= 2?1/5).\nTisserand\u2019s calculations were made to study the trajectories of comets in the vicinity of\nJupiter: \u201cIf we write down the condition for equality of the attractive ratios, we obtain\nthe equation of a surface for all the points of which it makes no difference whether we\nconsider the heliocentric motion disturbed by the action of Jupiter, or the jovicentric motion\ndisturbed by the action of the Sun.\u201d (Traite? de me?canique ce?leste, Vol. IV). The equality\nof the ratios he is referring to is just QT = QS. The process had already been suggested by\nD\u2019Alembert, Laplace, and Le Verrier. Laplace used the term sphere of activity.\n\n\n\n234 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nWe then have\n\n??0 = 2\n?1/3\n\n(\n?\n\n?S\n\n)1/3\naS , (6.160)\n\nand for the Earth\n\n??0 = 11.4\u00d7 10?3aS = 1.71\u00d7 106 km ,\n??0\nR\n\n= 269 .\n\nIf we use (6.153), the condition QT = 1 imposes a limiting value for the period\nT0 equal to\n\nT0 = TS/\n?\n2 = 258 d .\n\nIf the period of the satellite exceeds 258 days, this satellite will escape from the\nEarth\u2019s attraction. Note that ??0 is roughly twice ?? . For further discussion\nof these two values, see the appendix on Lagrange points below.\n\n6.12 Appendix: Lagrange Points\n\n6.12.1 Restricted Three-Body Problem\n\nThe Lagrange points arise in the context of the restricted three-body prob-\nlem, in which one of the bodies (here, the satellite) has negligible mass com-\npared with the two others. The two \u201cmassive\u201d bodies A and B revolve around\ntheir center of mass O (two-body problem) with constant angular speed ??. A\nthird, much lighter body C feels the gravitational attraction of A and B.\n\nLagrange showed that there are five special positions in space at which\nthe body C rotates about O with the same angular speed ??. In this situation,\nthe point C is stationary in a Sun\u2013Earth frame. The five points, traditionally\ndenoted by L1 to L5, are known as the Lagrange points or libration points\n\n42\n\n(see Fig. 6.8).\n\n6.12.2 Simplified Study of Points L1 and L2\n\nWe shall now find in a schematic manner the position of the first two\nLagrange points when B has much smaller mass than A, as is usually the\ncase. These equilibrium points are unstable. We use the notation of Sect. 6.11.\nThe center of mass is at A, and the body B revolves around A in a circular\n\n42The word \u201clibration\u201d comes from the Latin libratio, which itself comes from libra,\nmeaning \u201cbalance\u201d. The Moon\u2019s libration is a complex nodding motion around the central\nposition, composed of a physical and a geometric libration (in longitude and in latitude).\nIt is through this motion that we are able to see 59% of the Moon\u2019s surface from Earth,\ninstead of just a half. This term, generally applied to the case of lunar libration (also studied\nby Lagrange), is also used to refer to the five Lagrange points.\n\n\n\n6.12 Appendix: Lagrange Points 235\n\nL3 L1 L2\n\nL4\n\nL5\n\nA B\n\nFig. 6.8 : Schematic\n\nillustration of the five\n\nLagrange points. The\n\nfive points lie in the or-\n\nbital plane of B around\n\nA. The mass of B is\n\nconsidered to be small\n\ncompared with the mass\n\nof A.\n\norbit with constant angular speed ??. According to Kepler\u2019s third law applied\nto body B, we have\n\n?S = ??\n2a3S . (6.161)\n\nConsider a satellite C at Li, close to B, on the straight line AB. The point\nL1 lies between A and B, with L2 outside. The distance from C to A is thus\naS + ?r, with ? = ?1 for L1 and ? = +1 for L2. For each point L1 and L2,\nwe express the fact that the resultant of the attractive accelerations is equal\nto the radial acceleration. Note that the angular speed43 of L1 and L2 is ??.\nProjecting onto the AB axis and using the notation ?, we obtain\n\n?S\n(aS + ?r)2\n\n+ ?\n?\n\nr2\n= (aS + ?r)??\n\n2 . (6.162)\n\nDividing the left- and right-hand sides of (6.162) and (6.161) and using the\nreduced variables defined in (6.148), we find\n\n1\n\n(1 + ?x)2\n+ ?\n\n1\n\nkx2\n= 1 + ?x . (6.163)\n\n43If the bodies placed at L1 and L2 were in Keplerian orbit, the angular speeds would\nbe different, since the two distances from the attractor A are different. They are not in this\ntype of orbit because this is not a two-body problem, but a (restricted) three-body problem.\n\n\n\n236 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nWe can expand (1 + ?x)2 to first order in x since x ? 1, whereupon\n\n3?x ? ? 1\nkx2\n\n.\n\nCancelling out ?, we find that x has the same value in both cases. In fact, it\nsolves\n\n3kx3 = 1 . (6.164)\n\nFor the distances ?Li , we now have\n\nBL1 = BL2 = ?Li =\n\n(\n1\n\n3\n\n?\n\n?S\n\n)1/3\naS . (6.165)\n\nExample 6.4 Calculate the positions of the Lagrange points L1 and L2 for\nvarious astronomical systems.\n\n? For the Sun\u2013Earth system, where k = 3.329\u00d7 105, or 3k ? 106, we have\n\ndistance from center of Earth to L1,2 : ?Li = 10\n?2aS ? 1.5\u00d7 106 km .\n\nFor the Earth\u2013Moon system, where k = 81.3, replacing aS by aL, the mean\nradius of the lunar orbit, we find\n\ndistance from center of Moon to L1,2 : ?Li = (243.9)\n?1/3aL = 0.16aL\n\n? 6.\u00d7 104 km .\n\nFor the system consisting of Mars and its moon Phobos, where k = 5.05\u00d7107\nand aL = 9.38\u00d7 103 km, we obtain\n\ndistance from center of Phobos to L1,2 : ?Li = 1.88\u00d7 10?3aL ? 17.6 km .\n\nAs the subplanetary equatorial radius of Phobos is 13.4 km, the points L1 and\nL2 are only 4.2 km from the surface of Phobos. ?\n\n6.12.3 Lagrange Points and Sphere of Influence\n\nLet us compare the radii of the spheres of influence centered on the Earth\nwith the distance from the Earth to the Lagrange points L1 and L2. We use\nthe reduced distances x, denoted by x1 and x0 for the spheres of influence\n(with either Tisserand\u2019s definition or the simplified definition) and xL for the\nLagrange points. We recall the three relations:\n\n2k2x51 = 1 , 2kx\n3\n0 = 1 , 3kx\n\n3\nL = 1 .\n\n\n\n6.12 Appendix: Lagrange Points 237\n\nWriting x1 and x0 in terms of xL,\n\nx0 = 1.14xL , x1 = 1.35x\n6/5\nL , for the Earth x1 = 0.54xL .\n\nThe Lagrange point cannot lie within the sphere of influence, i.e., the region\nof space where the Earth\u2019s attraction dominates. We may thus consider that\nthe simplified definition, giving ??0 , is in fact a little too simple. Here is an\nillustration.\n\nIn Fig. 6.1, we have plotted the various accelerations as a function of the\ndistance from the center of the Earth. When the straight lines representing the\ncentral attraction, denoted by GM , and the differential attraction due to the\nSun, denoted by Sun, intersect one another (actually off the graph), we have\nequality between the quantities given in (6.5) and (6.7), and this amounts to\nwriting down the relation (6.159). This point of intersection (for r/R = 269)\ncan be used to obtain the radius ??0 . In fact, for these values of r/R, it is\nno long possible to approximate ?CS by a straight line. The true point of\nintersection between the two curves corresponds to the value calculated for\n?? using Tisserand\u2019s definition. We mentioned the simplified method here\nbecause this is the one usually presented in the literature.\n\n6.12.4 The Five Lagrange Points\n\nA complete analysis to find the five points and the equilibrium conditions\nis much more involved and goes beyond the scope of this book. The classic\nmethod consists in writing the equations in a frame rotating about O. This\nproduces two equations: one involves the first three points, and the other the\nlast two. The position of the points is shown schematically in Fig. 6.8 (where\nO coincides with A).\n\n\u2022 Points L1, L2, and L3 lie on the straight line AB. Let ? be the reduced\nmass and X the reduced distance defined by\n\n? =\n?\n\n?+ ?S\n=\n\n1\n\n1 + k\n, X =\n\nALi\nAB\n\n. (6.166)\n\nWe obtain the three possible values of X . Taking ? ? 1/k, the first two,\nfor L1 and L2, are as calculated above, viz., X = [1\u00b1 (?/3)1/3]. The third,\nfor L3, is X = ?[1+(5/12)?]. These three equilibrium points are unstable.\n\n\u2022 Points L4 and L5 can be shown to lie in the orbital plane of B around A, in\nsuch a way that triangles ABL4 and ABL5 are equilateral. The positions\nof L4 and L5 do not depend on the masses of the bodies A and B. It can\nalso be shown that these positions are stable, provided that the mass of A\n\n\n\n238 Chapter 6.

Note that, for the latter system, exact calculation\nof x gives 0.15 and 0.17 for BLi, whereas the approximate calculation in\nExample 6.4 gave 0.16 for both.\n\n6.12.5 Lagrange Points in Astronomy\n\nLagrange\u2019s theory was brilliantly confirmed in the field of planetary as-\ntronomy with the discovery of asteroids at the stable points L4 and L5 of\nthe Sun\u2013Jupiter system. The first, 588 Achilles, was discovered at L4 in 1906.\nThis was followed by 617 Patroclus at L5, and 624 Hector and 659 Nestor at\nL4. Several hundred asteroids are now known at the two stable points\n\n45 of this\nsystem, as illustrated in Fig. 6.9. The asteroids at L4 are called Greeks, while\nthose at L5 are the Trojans. The current trend is to use the term Trojans\n\n46\n\n44The exact calculation gives\n\nk > k0 , with k0 =\n25\n\n2\n\n?\n?1 +\n\n?\n1?\n(\n\n2\n\n25\n\n)2?? = 24.96 .\n\nThe numerical value of k0 is called the Routh value. For the planets in the Solar System,\nthis condition always holds by a large margin as far as the Sun is concerned. For the Earth\u2013\nMoon system, it also holds, since k = 81 in this case. The only known exception in the\nSolar System is provided by the Pluton\u2013Charon system.\n\n45The libration of these asteroids is 14? on average. It cannot exceed 30?.\n46The duality between Greeks and Trojans is intended to illustrate the unending pursuit,\n\nimmortalising the Iliad in the skies. However, there seems to have been some misunder-\nstanding of Homer\u2019s tale, for we find Patroclus with the Trojans and Hektor with the Greeks,\nenough to make Achilles writhe on his funeral pyre!\n\n\n\n6.12 Appendix: Lagrange Points 239\n\nA\u2013B system L1 L2 L3 L4, L5\n\nSun\u2013Earth\nALi X 0.990 1.010 0.999 1.000\nBLi x 0.00997 0.010 1.999 1.000\nALi 10\n\n6 km 148.10 151.10 149.4 149.6\nBLi 10\n\n6 km 1.49 1.50 299.0 149.6\nBLi R 234 236\n\nEarth\u2013Moon\nALi X 0.85 1.17 0.99 1.00\nBLi x 0.15 0.17 1.99 1.00\nALi 10\n\n3 km 326.7 449.7 380.6 384.4\nALi R 51 71 60 60\nBLi 10\n\n3 km 57.7 65.3 765.0 384.4\n\nTable 6.8 :Distances of bodies A and B from the Lagrange points Li (i = 1, . . . , 5).\n\nDistances are given in reduced units X and x (dimensionless), in km, and in units\n\nof R (Earth radius).\n\nfor the asteroids in both groups and to extend the term to other systems. The\nSun\u2013Mars also provides examples of Trojan asteroids (discovered since 1990).\n\nIn 1980, several new moons of Saturn were discovered at the Lagrange\npoints of the Saturn\u2013Dione and Saturn\u2013Tethys systems. These are known as\nthe Lagrangian moons. They librate around the stable positions L4 and L5.\n\n6.12.6 Artificial Satellites at Lagrange Points\n\nSince 1978, several artificial satellites have been placed at the point L1\nof the Sun\u2013Earth system (see Table 6.9). When the satellite arrives in the\nvicinity of the point L1, about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, it is placed\nin orbit around L1, since this is an unstable position. It then describes a halo\norbit, also denoted by L1LO, the L1 Lissajous orbit, since the trajectory looks\nlike a Lissajous curve.\n\nThe first satellite to be placed in a halo orbit about the L1 point was\nISEE-3 (Explorer-59), between 1978 and 1982. It was followed by Wind,\nSOHO, ACE, and Genesis, all of which carried out astronomical missions.\n\nThe view of the Sun is of course exceptional from L1 (a property put to\ngood use by the satellite SOHO), and the solar wind can be collected well\nupstream of the Earth (satellite Wind). But the point L1 has another ad-\nvantage: if one observes the Earth from this point, one always sees daylight!\nThe satellite Triana was designed to exploit this in the guise of an unremit-\nting environmental watchdog, and has been reactivated under the name of\nDSCOVR.\n\nThe L1LO orbit lies roughly in a plane tilted with respect to the ecliptic\nand has elliptical shape. It measures several hundred thousand kilometres\n\n\n\n240 Chapter 6.

Many other\nmissions are destined for a halo orbit around this point (an L2LO orbit).\nThese include the successors of Hipparcos and Hubble, namely GAIA and\nJWST, respectively, and longer term projects such as Eddington and Darwin.\n\nFor instruments cooled by liquid helium, for observation of the diffuse\ncosmic background (WMAP, Planck) or infrared emissions (Herschel, JWST),\nthe position at the L2 point ensures observation in the direction away from\nthe Sun will never be polluted by the view of the Earth.\n\n\n\n6.13 Appendix: Spherical Trigonometry 241\n\nDate L1 L2 Probe\n\n1978 \u2022 ISEE-3\n1994 \u2022 Wind\n1995 \u2022 SOHO\n1997 \u2022 ACE\n2001 \u2022 WMAP\n2001 \u2022 ?

The names can be understood by referring to Fig. 6.8\nand noting that the motion of the Earth around the Sun occurs in the anti-\nclockwise direction in that view. However, this orbit had to be abandoned\nand the two satellites, with the same names, have been placed in a heliocen-\ntric orbit ahead of and behind the Earth\u2019s position. The Japanese project\nL5-Mission is planned for L5.\n\nConcerning the L3 point of the Sun\u2013Earth system, it is not obvious what\nkind of project might be located there, except possibly a movie of the type\nPlanet X.\n\n6.13 Appendix: Spherical Trigonometry\n\n6.13.1 Gauss\u2019 Relations\n\nA spherical triangle is a triangle on a sphere of unit radius, whose sides\nare arcs of great circles (or angles at the center). The angles of the triangle\nare defined at each vertex in the tangent plane to the sphere (i.e., they are\ndihedral angles). The angles are usually denoted by A, B, C and the opposite\nsides by a, b, c, as shown in Fig. 6.10. It can be shown that a spherical triangle\nis determined by specifying three elements. A fourth element can be calculated\nfrom the three known elements. We then have (6\u00d7 5)/2 = 15 relations.\n\nThese trigonometric relations are easily obtained by considering the fol-\nlowing change of frame. Consider three points A, B, C on a sphere, forming a\n(non-flat) spherical triangle. We consider two orthonormal frames ?1 and ??1\nsuch that\n\n?1(O; i, j,k) , ??1(O; i?, j?,k?) , i = OA , i? = OB ,\n\nand such that k and k? coincide. We then have (i, i?) = c.\n\n\n\n242 Chapter 6.

The corresponding\n\nsides a, b, c are arcs\n\nof great circles defined\n\nby a = BC, b = CA,\n\nc = AB.\n\nThe frame ??1 is thus obtained from ?1 by rotating through an angle c\nabout k. In each of the two frames ?1 and ??1, OC can be written in Cartesian\ncoordinates\n\nOC =\n\n?\n? cos bsin b cosA\n\nsin b sinA\n\n?\n? , OC =\n\n?\n? cos a? sina cosB\n\nsin a sinB\n\n?\n? . (6.167)\n\nUsing the matrix for the rotation through angle c about k, we thus obtain\n\n?\n? cos a? sina cosB\n\nsin a sinB\n\n?\n? =\n\n?\n? cos c sin c 0? sin c cos c 0\n\n0 0 1\n\n?\n?\u00d7\n\n?\n? cos bsin b cosA\n\nsin b sinA\n\n?\n? . (6.168)\n\nWe thus obtain the three relations known as Gauss\u2019 relations:\n\ncos a = cos b cos c+ sin b sin c cosA , (6.169)\n\nsin a cosB = cos b sin c? sin b cos c cosA , (6.170)\n\nsin a sinB = sin b sinA . (6.171)\n\n\n\n6.13 Appendix: Spherical Trigonometry 243\n\n6.13.2 Fifteen Relations for the Spherical Triangle\n\nThese three equations lead us to the 15 required relations, which are\ngenerally grouped as follows. The relations are numbered with Roman nu-\nmerals from I to XV and the annotation ST, which stands for \u201cspherical\ntrigonometry\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Fundamental relations. These are deduced from (6.169) by cyclic permuta-\ntions. They relate three sides and an angle:\n\ncos a = cos b cos c+ sin b sin c cosA , (ST I)\n\ncos b = cos c cos a+ sin c sina cosB , (ST II)\n\ncos c = cos a cos b+ sin a sin b cosC . (ST III)\n\nAs a corollary, we obtain formulas relating three angles and one side:\n\ncosA = ? cosB cosC + sinB sinC cos a , (ST IV)\ncosB = ? cosC cosA+ sinC sinA cos b , (ST V)\ncosC = ? cosA cosB + sinA sinB cos c . (ST VI)\n\n\u2022 Sine formulas. These are deduced from (6.171). These three formulas relate\ntwo angles and the opposite sides:\n\n(ST VII)\n\nsina\n\nsinA\n=\n\nsin b\n\nsinB\n=\n\nsin c\n\nsinC\n. (ST VIII)\n\n(ST IX)\n\n\u2022 Cotangent formulas. These are deduced from (6.170), which involves five\nelements, and the two other Gauss relations. These formulas relate four\nconsecutive elements of the triangle:\n\ncota sin b = cos b cosC + sinC cotA , (ST X)\n\ncot b sina = cos a cosC + sinC cotB . (ST XI)\n\nThe second of these follows from the first by fixing the angle C and per-\nmuting a and b, A and B. By cyclic permutation, we now obtain\n\ncot b sin c = cos c cosA+ sinA cotB , (ST XII)\n\ncot c sin b = cos b cosA+ sinA cotC , (ST XIII)\n\ncot c sin a = cos a cosB + sinB cotC , (ST XIV)\n\ncota sin c = cos c cosB + sinB cotA . (ST XV)\n\nWe thus obtain 6+3+6 = 15 relations. In the case of a right-angled spherical\ntriangle, where one of the three angles is a right-angle, the above formulas\nreduce immediately to (5 \u00d7 4)/2 = 10 relations.\n\n\n\n244 Chapter 6. Satellite in Real (Perturbed) Orbit\n\nExample 6.5 Calculate the distance D between two points M(?, ?) and M ?(??,\n??) on the Earth, specified by their longitude and latitude.\n\n? To apply spherical trigonometry here, we treat the Earth as spherical. The\nlatitude ? thus represents just as well the geographical, geodetic, or geocen-\ntric latitude. Consider the spherical triangle NMM ?, where N represents the\nNorth Pole. If N corresponds to A, M to B, and M ? to C, the angle A and\nsides b and c can be written as follows in terms of the geographical data:\n\nA = ?? ?? , c = ?\n2\n? ? , b = ?\n\n2\n? ?? .\n\nThe required distance is then a, the length of the arc of great circle MM ?.\nThe first Gauss relation (6.169) or (ST I) then gives\n\ncos a = sin? sin?? + cos? cos?? cos(?? ??) . (6.172)\nThe required distance is D = Ra, if we consider the Earth as spherical with\nradius R and express a in radians. Note that, in this situation, we can obtain\nthe result by writing the scalar product OM \u00b7 OM ?.\n\nApplication: Calculate the distance from Paris to New York.\n\nThe geographical coordinates of Paris and New York are (48?50?N; 2?20?E)\nand (40?42?N; 74?00?W), respectively, which gives, for the points M and M ?,\n\n? = +48.87 , ? = +2.33 , ?? = +40.70 , ?? = ?74.00 .\nThe calculation yields\n\na = 0.91597 rad = 52.48? .\n\nWe thus obtain the distance directly in nautical miles (1 nautical mile is\nequivalent to 1? arcsec on the Earth\u2019s surface), viz.,\n\nD = 52.48\u00d7 60 = 3149 nautical miles ,\nor in kilometers, if we introduce the Earth\u2019s radius, viz.,\n\nD = 0.91597\u00d7R = 5842 km .\nThe curve (arc of a great circle) joining two points on the surface of the Earth\nis said to be orthodromic.\n\nNote. When two points are very close, it is better to transform the relation\ngiving cos a, using the half-angles to bring in the differences between the\nlatitudes and the longitudes:\n\nsin2\na\n\n2\n= sin2\n\n?? ??\n2\n\n+ cos? cos?? sin2\n?? ??\n\n2\n. (6.173)\n\nThis formula is valid if a ? [0, ?). ?\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nMotion of Orbit, Earth\n\nand Sun\nIn the last chapter, we calculated the motion of the orbital plane of a\n\nsatellite with respect to a Galilean frame, via the rate of nodal precession,\nand the motion of the orbit in this plane. At the beginning of this chapter, we\nshall review the way the Earth moves with respect to a Galilean frame. By\ncomposing the two motions, we will then be able to follow the motion of the\nsatellite relative to the Earth, which was indeed our original aim.\n\nWe shall then study the apparent motion of the Sun relative to the Earth,\nso that we may subsequently study the cycles of the satellite in relation to the\nSun. The aim here will ultimately be to specify the geometry of the satellite, its\ntarget, and the Sun: we consider a point on the Earth\u2019s surface and determine\nhow this point is seen by the satellite and under what conditions of solar\nillumination.\n\nIn the last two sections, we examine two types of satellite orbit for which\ntwo of the quantities studied here play a key role. These quantities are the\nmean motion n and the nodal precession rate ??. We shall find that they\ncan take certain values of particular importance for the satellite. The first\nquantity n determines the geosynchronous orbits, and the second ?? the Sun-\nsynchronous orbits.\n\n7.1 Motion of the Orbit\n\n7.1.1 Secular Variations: Simplified Case\n\nWe reconsider here the equations giving the secular variations of the or-\nbital elements for a circular orbit, in the context of a simplified geopotential\n(expansion up to degree 2). We then treat the general case.\n\nM. Capderou, Handbook of Satellite Orbits: From Kepler to GPS,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-03416-4 7,\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014\n\n245\n\n\n\n246 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nNote that, for an orbit with eccentricity e, the formulas for the precession\nrates ?? and ?? contain a multiplicative factor of (1? e2)?2 as compared with\nthe expressions for the circular orbit. For low eccentricities, this factor is\napproximately 1 + 2e2, which remains very close to 1.\n\nSecular Variation of Orbital Elements\n\nKeeping only the J2 term in the relative perturbation of the geopotential,\nwe showed in Chap. 6 that the metric elements remained constant, whilst the\nangle elements underwent secular variations. Using (6.73) through (6.75), we\nobtain the values of ??, ??, and M? as a function of the metric elements and\nthe mean motion n =\n\n?\n?/a3 :\n\n??\n\nn\n= ?3\n\n2\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2\ncos i , (7.1)\n\n??\n\nn\n=\n\n3\n\n4\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2\n(5 cos2 i? 1) , (7.2)\n\nM? ? n\nn\n\n=\n?n\n\nn\n=\n\n3\n\n4\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2\n(3 cos2 i? 1) . (7.3)\n\nThe secular variation of the orbital element ? will play a key role when we\ncome to study the trajectory of the satellite, as will the secular variations of\nthe elements ? and M when we calculate the period of the motion.\n\nConcerning the parameter ?, the secular variation ?? is perfectly well de-\nfined by (6.74) when e = 0. However, the position of the perigee, determined\nby ?, is not defined for a perfectly circular orbit (with e = 0), and it is poorly\ndefined in the case of a near-circular orbit. Concerning the parameter M ,\nwhose secular variation M? ? n0 is perfectly well defined by (6.75) for e = 0,\nwe encounter the same problem in defining an origin, for both circular and\nnear-circular orbits. In these cases, we generally choose the ascending node as\norigin (see Sect. 5.2.3 on adapted orbital elements).\n\nNodal Precession Rate\n\nUsing (7.1) and expressing the mean (Keplerian) motion, the nodal pre-\ncession rate can be written\n\n?? = ?3\n2\nJ2\n\n?\n?\n\nR3\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)7/2\ncos i , (7.4)\n\nand this can in turn be set in the form\n\n??(a, i) = ?K0\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)7/2\ncos i , (7.5)\n\n\n\n7.1 Motion of the Orbit 247\n\nor again, using the reduced distance ? defined earlier,\n\n?? = ?K0??7/2 cos i , (7.6)\n\nwith\n\nK0 =\n3\n\n2\nJ2\n\n?\n?\n\nR3\n. (7.7)\n\nWe can also write K0 in the following form, using (5.5) and (5.6):\n\nK0 =\n3?\n\nT0(h=0)\nJ2 , (7.8)\n\nor again, using (3.5) and denoting the average mass of the planet per unit\nvolume by ?o,\n\nK0 =\n?\n3?GJ2\n\n?\n?o . (7.9)\n\nConcerning the units of the angular velocity, apart from radians per second\n(SI units), the units degrees per day and revolutions per year are also found\nin the literature. With these three units, K0 is expressed as follows:\n\nK0 = 2.012788\u00d7 10?6 rad s?1 , (7.10)\n\nK0 = 9.964014\n?d?1 , (7.11)\n\nK0 = 10.10949 rev year\n?1 . (7.12)\n\nThe function ??(a, i) has been plotted in two different ways in Fig. 7.1:\n\n\u2022 The upper panel shows ?? as a function of the semi-major axis a for different\nvalues of the inclination i.\n\n\u2022 The lower panel shows ?? as a function of the inclination i for various values\nof the ratio a/R.\n\nThe altitude thus varies from h = 0 for a/R = 1 to h = R = Re = 6,378km\nfor a/R = 2, in steps of 0.1R = 637.8km. Values of ?? are given in degrees\nper day.\n\nThese graphs are combined in the upper part of Fig. 7.2. We plot curves of\nfixed nodal precession rate ?? (nodal isoprecession curves) as a function of the\ninclination i and the altitude h (or a/R). From these graphs, it is clear that,\nwhen h increases for a given inclination, ?? decreases. The further the satellite\nmoves from the center of the Earth, the less it is affected by irregularities in the\ngeopotential. We also see that, in the case of prograde orbits, ?? is negative,\ni.e., precession is retrograde, whereas in the case of retrograde orbits, ?? is\npositive. For a strictly polar orbit, ?? is always zero, at all altitudes.\n\nThe maximal value of |??| is obtained for i = 0? or i = 180?, with h = 0,\nand it is equal to K0 = 9.96\n\n?/day, or almost 10? per day. The value of ??,\n\n\n\n248 Chapter 7.

Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nclose to 1, and denoted by SSyn on the two graphs of Fig. 7.2, is relevant for\nthe so-called Sun-synchronous satellites, which we shall discuss at the end of\nthis chapter. (In this case, ?? = 0.986?/day.)\n\nFigure 7.2 (lower) enlarges the part of the graph relevant to satellites\nplaced in low orbit, as we shall see shortly. For example, the satellite Meteor-3-\n07 has h ? 1,200km and i ? 83?, for which we find the value ?? = ?0.71?/day\non the graph. For Lageos-1, with h ? 5,890 km and i ? 110?, we find ?? =\n+0.34?/day.\n\nApsidal Precession Rate\n\nThe apsidal precession rate defined by (7.2) can also be expressed in terms\nof the constant K0 given by (7.7):\n\n?? =\n1\n\n2\nK0\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)7/2\n(5 cos2 i? 1) . (7.13)\n\nThis is zero at the critical inclination defined in Chap. 6.\nFigure 7.3 is a graph of ??(a, i) as a function of the inclination i for various\n\nvalues of the ratio a/R. The value of ?? is given with the same units and\nthe same scale as ??. The two values of the critical inclination appear quite\nclearly on the graph at 63.4? and 116.6?. Example 7.1 illustrates this question\nfurther.\n\nVariation of the Mean Motion\n\nLike the precession rates, the variation of the mean motion defined by (7.3)\ncan be expressed in terms of K0 :\n\n?n =\n1\n\n2\nK0\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)7/2\n(3 cos2 i? 1) . (7.14)\n\nFigure 7.4 graphs the variation ?n of the mean motion as a function of the\ninclination i for various values of the ratio ? = a/R. We observe that, for i\nbetween 57.7? and 125.3?, the true motion is slower than the motion relative\nto a spherical Earth.\n\n7.1.2 Secular Variations up to Degree 4\n\nIf we consider an elliptical orbit and the expansion of the geopotential\nto a high degree, the expressions for the variations of the orbital elements\nbecome extremely complex. We shall not be concerned here with the periodic\nvariations, affecting all the orbital elements. The secular variations concern\nonly the angle elements and we have shown that only the even zonal harmonics\nJ2n are involved.\n\nTable 7.1 gives expressions for these secular variations in terms of a, e,\nand i, up to degree 4 in R/p. As well as the terms of degree 2 for J2, there\n\n\n\n7.1 Motion of the Orbit 251\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\nInclination (deg)\n\nA\nP\n\nS\nID\n\nA\nL \n\npr\nec\n\nes\nsi\n\non\n r\n\nat\ne \n\n(d\neg\n\n/d\nay\n\n)\n\nFig. 7.3 :Apsidal precession rate ??(a, i) (in degrees per day) for a circular or near-\n\ncircular orbit as a function of the inclination i for various values of the ratio ? = a/R\n\nbetween ? = 1.0 and ? = 2.0, in steps of 0.1.\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\n\nInclination (deg)\n\nV\nar\n\nia\ntio\n\nn \nof\n\n th\ne \n\nm\nea\n\nn \nm\n\not\nio\n\nn \n(d\n\neg\n/d\n\nay\n)\n\nFig. 7.4 :Variation of the mean motion ?n(a, i) (in degrees per day) for a circular\n\nor near-circular orbit as a function of the inclination i for various values of the ratio\n\n? = a/R from ? = 1.0 to ? = 2.0, in steps of 0.1.\n\n\n\n252 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nare two terms of degree 4, one for J4 and one for J\n2\n2 . These quantities are\n\nexpressed in terms of their quotient by n, the mean motion. In each case, one\nthus obtains a ratio of angular speeds, which is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nThe expressions for ?? and ?? in (7.15) and (7.16), respectively, were ob-\ntained from J. Kovalevsky\u2019s analytical theory of satellite motion in [5], while\nthe expression for ?n in (7.17) was derived using the theory of P.E. Koskela\net al. in [18]. These results are also presented in a slightly different way in\nother books on space mechanics, such as [22, 28].\n\n7.1.3 Secular Variations up to Degree n\n\nIn the literature, one can find analytic expressions for the secular variations\nup to order (see, e.g., [5]). These are complex, as one would imagine. The\ncontribution of the terms in J22 , J4, and J6 for the variations ?? and ?? are\nshown in Fig. 7.5. Roughly speaking, they represent one or two hundredths of\nthe contributions due to J2.\n\n7.1.4 Removing Precessional Motion\n\nBy a clever choice of orbital parameters, secular variations can be cancelled\nout. In this way, precessional effects can be removed, which may be useful for\ncertain missions.\n\nCancelling Nodal Precession\n\nSome satellites have an inclination of 90? to within a few tenths of a degree.\nThey are said to be strictly polar, or on a strictly polar orbit. Equation (7.15)\nshows that the rate of nodal precession is then zero, since the term cos i is a\nfactor in all the Jn terms.\n\nThe orbit of the satellite thus remains fixed1 in ?, making a constant angle\nwith a fixed direction in space (the direction of the vernal point ?). This orbit\nis sometimes called an inertial orbit. Strictly polar orbits are generally used by\nsatellites studying remote regions of the Earth environment2 and by military\nand geodetic satellites (the US Navy\u2019s Transit system, which was the first\noperational navigation system). The satellite CoRoT, designed for detection\n\n1Over a few years, there is a slight precessional motion for these orbits, but less than a\ndegree per year. This is due to other perturbations, such as the attraction of the Moon or\nSun, radiation pressure, and so on.\n\n2To study the magnetosphere, NASA launched two satellites on 3 August 1981 in a single\nlaunch: Dynamics Explorer-1 and -2 (Explorer-62 and -64, also called DE-A and DE-B), the\nfirst in a high-altitude orbit (hp = 468 km, ha = 23,322 km), the second in a low-altitude\norbit (hp = 304 km, ha = 1,002 km). To ensure that they can make joint observations of the\nsame phenomena, it was essential that they move in the same orbital plane, and this was\nonly possible by choosing a polar plane, i = 90?, since otherwise nodal precession would\nhave between different for DE-A and DE-B.\n\n\n\n7.1 Motion of the Orbit 253\n\n??\n\nn\n= J2\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)2\ncos i\n\n(\n?3\n2\n\n)\n\n+J22\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)4\ncos i\n\n[(\n?45\n\n8\n+\n\n3\n\n4\ne2 +\n\n9\n\n32\ne4\n)\n+\n\n(\n57\n\n8\n? 69\n\n32\ne2 ? 27\n\n64\ne4\n)\ns2\n]\n\n+J4\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)4\ncos i\n\n(\n15\n\n4\n? 105\n\n16\ns2\n)(\n\n1 +\n3\n\n2\ne2\n)\n\n(7.15)\n\n??\n\nn\n= J2\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)2 (\n3? 15\n\n4\ns2\n)\n\n+J22\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)4 [(\n27\n\n2\n? 15\n\n16\ne2 ? 9\n\n16\ne4\n)\n\n+\n\n(\n?507\n\n16\n+\n\n171\n\n32\ne2 +\n\n99\n\n64\ne4\n)\ns2\n\n+\n\n(\n1185\n\n64\n? 675\n\n128\ne2 ? 135\n\n128\ne4\n)\ns4\n]\n\n+J4\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)4 [(\n?3\n8\n+\n\n15\n\n8\ns2 ? 105\n\n64\ns4\n)(\n\n10 +\n15\n\n2\ne2\n)\n\n+\n\n(\n?15\n\n4\n+\n\n165\n\n16\ns2 ? 105\n\n16\ns4\n)(\n\n1 +\n3\n\n2\ne2\n)]\n\n(7.16)\n\n?n\n\nn\n=\n\nM? ? n\nn\n\n= J2\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)2\ne?\n3\n\n4\n(2? 3s2)\n\n\u00d7\n{\n1 + J2\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)2\n1\n\n8\n\n[\n10 + 5e2 + 8e? ?\n\n(\n65\n\n6\n? 25\n\n12\ne2 + 12e?\n\n)\ns2\n]}\n\n?J22\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)4\ne?\n\n5\n\n64\n(2? e2)s2\n\n?J4\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)4\ne?\n\n45\n\n128\ne2(8? 40s2 + 35s4) (7.17)\n\nTable 7.1 :Secular variations of the angle elements with expansion of the gravita-\n\ntional potential up to order 4.

Note the scale on the vertical axis.\n\n\n\n7.1 Motion of the Orbit 255\n\nof exoplanets and asteroseismology, is in an inertial orbit3 with an inclination\nof i = 89.92?.\n\nThe Gravity Probe Relativity Mission is testing Einstein\u2019s general theory\nof relativity. To do this, the satellite Gravity Probe B (GP-B) must have a\npolar inclination.4\n\nApart from the cases mentioned above, few space missions need to remove\nnodal precession altogether. However, it is common practice to select some\nspecific nonzero value of ?? in the case of Sun-synchronous satellites, as we\nshall see later.\n\nCancelling Apsidal Precession\n\nWhen the secular apsidal variation vanishes, the argument of the perigee\n? remains constant. The fixed position of the perigee on an orbit, especially\na highly eccentric orbit, may be a decisive factor. It is easy to solve\n\n??(a, e, i; Jn) = 0 , (7.18)\n\nwith ?? defined by (7.16), if we restrict to order 2. For an expansion of ?? cut\noff at J2, (7.18) reduces to 5 cos\n\n2 i = 1 and the solution is given by (6.79). The\ninclination is equal to the critical inclination. This value iC does not depend\non any orbital parameter, even those of the given planet.\n\nTo higher order, solution is more involved, but it is straightforward to\nobtain results using numerical methods, given that the value of i is very close\nto the one specified by (6.79). The solution i depends very slightly on a and\ne, together with the coefficients Jn.\n\nNote. In this book, when we mention a critical inclination in the various\nrepresentations of the satellite ground tracks, we shall always be referring to\nthe inclination calculated up to order 4 for ??.\n\nExample 7.1 Calculate the critical inclination for Molniya-type satellites.\n\n? The characteristics of Molniya-3-50 on 10 April 2013 were:\n\na = 26,556.863 km , e = 0.7059346 , i = 64.3690? , ? = 257.638? .\n\n3This orbit, free of nodal precession, remains fixed in a Galilean frame and the satellite\nviews in a direction orthogonal to the orbital plane. In fact, it views the same region\ncontinually for a period of 180 days, then turns round to view in the opposite direction,\nthus avoiding the Sun. The two regions viewed are at the intersection of the galactic plane\nand the celestial equator.\n\n4The satellite is equipped with gyroscopes and the aim is to measure effects predicted by\ngeneral relativity: the geodesic effect (6,606milliarcsec per year, or 1.8\u00d7 10?3 degree/year)\nand the Lense\u2013Thirring effect, or frame dragging (39 mas/year, or 1.1\u00d710?5 degree/year).\nThese two effects are maximally decoupled when the axis of rotation of the satellite on its\norbit is orthogonal to the axis of rotation of the Earth, i.e., i = 90?.\n\n\n\n256 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nTo order 2, the solution is given by (6.79), given that this satellite has a\nprograde orbit (i < 90?):\n\niC = 63.4349\n? = iC(J2) .\n\nWith (7.16) and expanding ?? up to J4, the elements a and e come in. We\nobtain\n\niC = 63.4246\n? = iC(J4) .\n\nThis changes little if we expand beyond J4. Note that\n\niC(J2)? iC(J4) = 0.0103? ? 0.01? .\nThe inclination of this satellite, here i = 64.3690?, is only 0.06? from the\ncritical inclination iC. This difference could be 1 or 2\n\n? without there being\nsignificant consequences. ?\n\nCancelling the Variation in the Mean Motion\n\nTwo values of the inclination, namely 54.7? and 125.3?, lead to a zero\nvalue for ?n, defined by (6.75), as discussed in Chap. 6. To our knowledge,\nthis constraint has never been imposed for a space mission. However, it should\nbe noted that the Navstar/GPS (Block II) satellites have an inclination of\ni = 55? which leads to an almost zero value for ?n. The mean motion of\nthese satellites is the same as if the Earth were spherical.\n\n7.1.5 Effective Calculation of Period and Altitude\n\nWe shall now give two examples of calculations involving the relation be-\ntween the period of a satellite and its altitude. In the first, we calculate the pe-\nriod of a satellite of known altitude, and in the second, the converse (and more\ndifficult) problem, that is, we determine the altitude of a satellite of known\nperiod. Other examples of this type will be discussed in Chap. 11 (where the\nperiod will be defined by the recurrence condition).\n\nWhen we speak of the altitude of a satellite in this context, we are in fact\nreferring to the difference between the semi-major axis a of the orbit and the\nequatorial radius of the Earth, i.e., h = a ? R. The quantity h is usually\nused to describe the satellite, but it is the quantity a that is used in orbital\ncalculations.\n\nExample 7.2 Calculate the period of the satellite TRMM in near-circular or-\nbit at an altitude of 402 km, and with inclination 35?.\n\n? For this satellite, on 10 April 2013, the orbital elements were as follows:\n\na = 6,780.345 km (or h = 402.2km) , i = 34.9580? , e = 5.5\u00d7 10?5 .\n\n\n\n7.1 Motion of the Orbit 257\n\nWe may thus consider the orbit to be circular. We begin by calculating the\nKeplerian mean motion for a, viz.,\n\nn0 =\n\n[\n3.98600436\u00d7 1014\n(6.780345\u00d7 106)3\n\n]1/2\n= 1.130813\u00d7 10?3 rad s?1 ,\n\nwhich gives the Keplerian period as\n\nT0 =\n2?\n\nn0\n= 5,556.34 s = 92.606min .\n\nExpressing the numerical factor, the relative ?n/n0 is then found to be\n\n?n\n\nn\n= 8.119701\u00d7 10?4??2(3 cos2 i? 1) . (7.19)\n\nIn this case, we obtain\n\n?n\n\nn0\n= 8.1197\u00d7 10?4\n\n(\n6.378137\u00d7 106\n6.780348\u00d7 106\n\n)2 [\n3(0.81950)2 ? 1\n\n]\n= 7.291\u00d7 10?4 .\n\nUsing the more complex relation (7.17), we obtain 7.299\u00d7 10?4, which gives\nthe true mean motion as\n\nn = n0 +?n = 1.133562\u00d7 10?3 rad s?1 .\n\nThe actual motion is thus faster than the Keplerian motion (?n > 0, since\nwe have i < 57.7?). The anomalistic period Ta is obtained from (6.102) as\n\nTa =\n92.606\n\n1 + 7.299\u00d7 10?4 = 92.538min .\n\nWe now calculate the apsidal precession rate ??. Using (7.2) or (7.13), we have\n??/n = 1.694 \u00d7 10?4, and using the more complex relation (7.16), ??/n =\n1.699\u00d7 10?4. The draconitic period Td is found from (6.107) or (6.108) to be\n\nTd = 92.381min .\n\nNote that the apsidal precession ?? is positive, since i < 63.4?, and that it is\nquite significant, with a value of ?? = 9.51? per day.\n\nFinally, we have\n\nTd < Ta < T0 ,\n\nwith a time difference in seconds of\n\nTa ? Td = 9.44 s , Ta ? T0 = ?4.05 s , Td ? T0 = ?13.49 s .\n\nThe satellite TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission) is a Japanese\nproject in collaboration with NASA. It has a low inclination so as to cover\nthe intertropical region and flies at low altitude to improve the efficiency of its\nradar instrumentation. From its launch in November 1997 until August 2001,\nit flew at an altitude of 350km. Subsequently, in order to extend its lifetime\n(by reducing atmospheric drag), it was raised to an altitude of 402 km. ?\n\n\n\n258 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nExample 7.3 Calculate the altitude of satellite Meteor-3-07, in near-circular\norbit with draconitic period 109.421 min and inclination 82.56?.\n\n? It is more difficult to calculate the altitude from the period than vice versa,\nas in Example 7.2. We proceed by iteration. Secular variations are calculated\nusing relations up to degree 4.\n\n\u2022 We begin by calculating a0, the value of a corresponding to the Keplerian\nmotion with the given period. The value of Td is given by the satellite orbit\nbulletin as Td = 109.421425min. In a first step, we thus set T0 = Td =\n6,565.2856 s. The calculation gives\n\na30 =\n?\n\n4?2\nT0\n\n2 =\n3.98600436\u00d7 1014\n\n4?2\n(6.5652856)2 \u00d7 106 ,\n\nwhence\n\na0 = 7,578.129 km .\n\nWith this value for a0, the inclination i and n0 = 2?/T0, we can calculate\n?n and ??. We find\n\n?n\n\nn0\n= ?5.469\u00d7 10?4 , ??\n\nn0\n= ?5.267\u00d7 10?4 .\n\nThe true motion here is slower than the Keplerian motion (?n < 0), so\nthat Ta > T0, and the perigee revolves in the retrograde direction (?? < 0),\nso that Ta < Td. We thus have\n\nTd > Ta > T0 .\n\n\u2022 Considering the approximate formula (6.108), we see that this value a0 for\nthe orbital radius corresponds to the Keplerian period T0 and a draconitic\nperiod Td given by\n\nTd =\n\n(\n1 +\n\n?T\n\nT0\n\n)\nT0 .\n\nwith\n\n?T = Td ? T0 ,\n?T\n\nT0\n? ? ?? +?n\n\nn0\n.\n\nSince the fractional differences are much smaller than unity, this yields\n\nT0 ?\n(\n1? ?T\n\nTd\n\n)\nTd .\n\n\n\n7.2 Motion of the Earth 259\n\nAs the value of Td is known, we obtain T0 from T0 = Td??T . Now for\nthis value of T0, there corresponds an orbit of radius a1, obtained from a0\nby a1 = a0 +?a. The differential relation between a and T is\n\ndT\n\nT\n=\n\n3\n\n2\n\nda\n\na\n.\n\nGoing to finite increments, da corresponds to a1 ? a0 = ?a and dT corre-\nsponds to T0 ? Td = ??T . We obtain\n\n?a =\n2\n\n3\n\n?? +?n\n\nn0\na0 = ?\n\n2\n\n3\n1.0735\u00d7 10?3 \u00d7 7,578.129 = ?5.423 km .\n\nWe thus find\n\na1 = 7,572.706 km .\n\n\u2022 The iteration continues in this way, using (6.107), and the results converge\nvery rapidly to give\n\na = 7,572.704 km ,\n\nwhich corresponds to an equivalent altitude h = a?R = 1,194.6km.\n\nFor the values of the periods, we obtain\n\nTd = 109.421min , Ta = 109.364min , T0 = 109.304min .\n\nThis shows how important it is to distinguish the various periods. The dif-\nferences found here provide clear evidence for this: Td ? Ta = 3.46 s and\nTd ? T0 = 7.04 s.\n\nWith the values obtained, we can calculate the nodal precession rate to\nbe\n\n?? = ?1.429\u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 = 0.71?/day ,\n\nbut this is not needed in the calculation of the period. ?\n\n7.2 Motion of the Earth\n\nThe motions of the Earth relative to a Galilean frame ? fixed relative to\nthe Sun can be broken down into three components:\n\n\u2022 the revolution of the Earth axis about the Sun, with its yearly period.\n\u2022 the rotation of the Earth about this axis, with daily period.\n\u2022 the motion of the poles, which is a tiny movement of the Earth relative to\n\nits axis of rotation.\n\n\n\n260 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\n7.2.1 Motion of the Earth About the Sun\n\nEarth Revolutions\n\nThe angular speed with which the Earth axis moves around the Sun is\ndenoted by ??S. (This is used by analogy with the rate of precession ?? of the\nlongitude of the ascending node, but we add a subscript S to indicate the\nSun.) It has the value\n\n??S = 1.99099299\u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 , (7.20)\n\nwhich corresponds to\n\n??S = 0.9856\n?/day . (7.21)\n\nDefinitions of the Year\n\nThe Earth takes 1 year to cover its elliptical orbit around the Sun. This is\nthe period of revolution. There are several definitions of the year:\n\n\u2022 Sidereal Year. This is the duration of the Earth\u2019s orbit about the Sun\nreferred to a fixed (Copernican frame). It is equal to 365 days 6 h 9min\n9.76 s.\n\n\u2022 Tropical Year. This is the duration of the Earth\u2019s orbit about the Sun\nreferred to a moving average frame. In fact, it is the time elapsed between\ntwo consecutive transits of the Sun through the vernal equinox (the spring\nequinox). It is equal to 365 days 5 h 48min 45.25 s.\n\nThe tropical year determines the recurrence of the seasons.5 The tropical\nyear is 20min shorter than the sidereal year. This difference is due to the\n\n5The civil year aims to be as close as possible to the tropical year. The Julian (civil)\nyear, introduced in 45 bc under the auspices of Julius Caesar, with one leap year every four\nyears, has an average duration of\n\nNciv(j) = 365 + 1/4 = 365.25 d .\n\nIt thus differs from the tropical year by 0.78 days per century. In 325 ad, the Council of\nNicaea specified how to calculate the date of Easter given the date of the spring equinox,\nwhich was 21 March at this time (it had been 25 March at the time of Caesar). In 1582,\nthe discrepancy was therefore\n\n0.78(1582 ? 325)/100 = 9.8 ? 10 d ,\n\nand the equinox occurred on 11 March (Easter being calculated from 21 March). To bring\nthe vernal equinox back to 21 March and keep it there, (a) 10 days had to be removed from\nthe calendar and (b) the average length of the civil year had to be slightly modified. This\nis what was decreed by Pope Gregory XIII in the papal bull known as Inter gravissimas\n(Inter gravissimas pastoralis officii nostri curas . . . , \u201camong the most noble tasks of our\npastoral ministry . . . \u201d), which gave the Gregorian calendar: (a) the day following Thursday\n4 October will be Friday 15 October 1582; (b) 3 days will be suppressed every 400 years\n(years that are multiples of 100, but not 400, will not be leap years). The Gregorian (civil)\nyear thus has an average duration of\n\n\n\n7.2 Motion of the Earth 261\n\nretrograde motion of the vernal equinox, known as the precession of the\nequinoxes (see Chap. 6).\n\n\u2022 Anomalistic Year. This is the time elapsed between two transits at per-\nihelion. It is equal to 365 days 6 h 13 m 53 s. It is used in calculations\nrelating to the Keplerian motion of the Earth around the Sun.6\n\nThe durations of these years, denoted by Nsid, Ntro, and Nano, are given in\ndecimal days by:\n\nNsid = 365.256363004 d , (7.22)\n\nNtro = 365.242190402 d , (7.23)\n\nNano = 365.259641 d . (7.24)\n\n7.2.2 Motion of the Earth About the Polar Axis\n\nEarth Rotational Motion\n\nLet ??T be the angular speed of the Earth in its rotation about its own axis\n(using ?? because this is the angular speed of the longitude ? of the ascending\nnode, and we affix the subscript T to indicate \u201cterrestrial\u201d). It has the value\n\n??T = 7.29211467\u00d7 10?5 rad s?1 , (7.25)\n\nwhich corresponds to\n\n??T = 360.985559\n?/day . (7.26)\n\nDefinitions of the Day\n\n\u2022 Astronomical Day. As we saw earlier, the astronomical definition of the\nday is\n\n1 d = 86,400 s .\n\n\u2022 Mean Day. The mean day DM is the time lapse, averaged over one year,\nbetween two meridian transits in the direction of the Sun, i.e., between two\nconsecutive noons.7\n\nNciv(g) = 365 + 1/4? 1/100 + 1/400 = 365.2425 d .\n\nIt differs from the tropical year by only 0.3 days per millennium. The Julian year was\ndefined byNjul = Nciv(j) in Sect. 6.10.\n\n6If we compare these definitions of the year with the definitions of the different periods of\na satellite discussed in Chap. 6, the anomalistic year corresponds to the anomalistic period\nTa, while the tropical year corresponds to the nodal or draconitic period Td. The draconitic\nyear is defined in terms of the lunar motion.\n\n7The word \u201cmeridian\u201d comes from the Latin adjective meridianus, meaning \u201crelating\nto noon\u201d, derived from meridies, ei, or \u201cnoon\u201d. This noun is constructed from the locative\nform *mediei die, \u201cin the middle of the day\u201d. The remainder d - d transformed to r - d by\na well-known linguistic process known as dissimilation.\n\n\n\n262 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nIn practice, we have DM = 1 d. The mean day DM was no longer used to\ndefine the second when it was demonstrated that the Earth\u2019s rotation was\nslowing down, which has consequences for the difference TAI ?UT1.\n\n\u2022 Sidereal Day. The sidereal day Dsid is the interval of time between two\nmeridian transits in the direction of the vernal point8:\n\nDsid = DM ? 3m 55.9 s . (7.27)\n\nThe rate of rotation of the Earth is\n\n??T = 1.002737909350795 revolutions per sidereal day . (7.28)\n\nThis is the value used in the present book.\nBy taking into account the (very small) variations in the Earth\u2019s rotation,\n\nthe ratio ? between the universal and sidereal time intervals is given by\n\n? = ??T + 5.9006\u00d7 10?11Tu ? 5.9\u00d7 10?15T 2u , (7.29)\n\nwhere Tu, the time elapsed in a Julian century, is obtained by Tu = du/36,525,\nwith du the number of days elapsed since 1 January 2000, at 12 h.\n\n\u2022 Stellar Day. The stellar day is the time interval between two meridian\ntransits in the direction of a fixed star.\n\nThe rate of rotation per stellar day is the quantity denoted by \u201crate of advance\nof ERA\u201d in Table 6.6:\n\n??T stell = 1.00273781191135448 revolutions per stellar day . (7.30)\n\nAngular Frequencies of the Motions\n\nThe duration of the tropical year in seconds can be written\n\nNtro = N\n?\nyr \u00d7DM , (7.31)\n\n8The sidereal day is the time taken by the Earth, it is daily rotation, to return to a\ngiven direction which is not exactly fixed, since it follows the precessional motion of the\nequinoxes. The duration of the sidereal day is therefore\n\nDM \u00d7\nNtro\n\nNtro + 1\n= 86,164.09053083288 s ,\n\nor 23 h 56min 04.0905 s. The duration of the stellar day is\n\nDM \u00d7\nNsid\n\nNsid + 1\n= 86,164.098903691 s ,\n\nor 23 h 56min 04.0989 s. We thus see that the sidereal day is related to the tropical year\nand the stellar day to the sidereal year.\n\n\n\n7.2 Motion of the Earth 263\n\nwhere N ?yr is the number of days in the tropical year and DM is 86,400 s. The\nangular frequencies can then be expressed in radians per second in terms of\nthe duration of the tropical year:\n\n??S =\n2?\n\nDM\nN ?yr , ??T =\n\n2?\n\nDM\n\nN ?yr + 1\nN ?yr\n\n. (7.32)\n\nThis implies the following relation between the angular frequencies of these\ntwo motions of the Earth:\n\n??T ? ??S =\n2?\n\nDM\n. (7.33)\n\nIn degrees per day, this becomes\n\n??T ? ??S = 360?/day .\n\n7.2.3 Motion of the Poles\n\nIf we represent on a map the successive positions of the virtual point where\nthe Earth\u2019s axis of rotation cuts the ground surface, we obtain the polhody.9\n\nThis indicates the instantaneous pole. It manifests the motion of the Earth\u2019s\ncrust relative to the axis of rotation.\n\nThis motion was discovered through astronomical observations, mainly\nthose of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Specific satellites, such as\nLAGEOS and those, like SPOT, equipped with the DORIS system, are now\ncontributing, as we have seen in the discussion of terrestrial reference systems\nin Sect. 3.6.\n\nPolar motion has two main components:\n\n\u2022 A roughly circular oscillation with a cyclically varying diameter and a pe-\nriod of 14 months (435 days), discovered by Chandler in 1885.\n\n\u2022 A slow and unpredictable drift of the average position of the pole.\n\nIn Fig. 7.6, the first component is represented by a dashed spiral for the period\n2001\u20132006. The erratic displacements of the average position of the pole, or\nthe mean pole, are represented by a continuous curve for the period 1900\u2013\n2000. The unit is the second of arc, which corresponds to 1852/60 ? 31m at\nthe surface of the Earth.\n\nThe diameter of the polhody on the Chandler cycle can reach 0.5??, or\nabout 15m. With the advent of the GPS and the possibility of measuring\n\n9The word polhodie was coined by the French mathematician L. Poinsot in 1851 from the\nGreek ? ?)\n?\t? ??, meaning \u201cpivot\u201d and ? ?#)\t? ??, meaning \u201cway\u201d. In principle, a Greek\nword like hodos only retains its initial aspiration (rough breathing) when it combines with\nthe previous letter to form an aspirated letter, e.g., in the words \u201canode\u201d and \u201ccathode\u201d.\nOne should write \u201cpolode\u201d.\n\n\n\n264 Chapter 7.

However, in the present book, we shall not look\nfurther into this issue.\n\n7.2.4 Motion of the Orbit and Earth\n\nLater, we shall often need to compare the motion of a satellite, mainly\ncharacterised by the two angular speeds n (mean motion) and ?? (nodal pre-\ncession rate), with the two motions of the Earth discussed above.\n\nDaily Orbital Frequency ?\n\nWe denote the daily orbital frequency of the satellite by ?. Strictly speak-\ning, it is not a frequency, but rather a (dimensionless) number, representing as\nit does the number of round trips per day, counted from the ascending node.\nThis quantity is related to the draconitic (nodal) period by\n\n? = ?d =\nDM\nTd\n\n. (7.34)\n\nWith (7.33) and the definition of nd in (6.103), we obtain\n\n? =\nnd\n\n??T ? ??S\n. (7.35)\n\n\n\n7.2 Motion of the Earth 265\n\nWe use the symbol P for the (dimensionless) number representing the nodal\nprecession in round trips per year.10 We have\n\n?? =\n2?\n\nDM\n\nP\n\nN ?yr\n. (7.36)\n\nWe thus obtain the following relations in terms of P :\n\n??T ? ?? =\n2?\n\nDM\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1? P\nN ?yr\n\n)\n, (7.37)\n\n??S ? ?? =\n2?\n\nDM\n\n1? P\nN ?yr\n\n. (7.38)\n\nWe shall also need to compare ??T ? ?? with nd. We have\n??T ? ??\n\nnd\n=\n\n1\n\n?\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1? P\nN ?yr\n\n)\n. (7.39)\n\nThe following two expressions for the quantity P are particularly useful:\n\nP =\nDM\n2?\n\nN ?yr?? , (7.40)\n\nP =\n??\n\n??S\n. (7.41)\n\nThe last relation merely reformulates the definition of P .\nWe also define the frequency ?a, which is the number of revolutions made\n\nby the satellite every day, counted from the perigee. It is related to the anoma-\nlistic period by\n\n?a =\nDM\nTa\n\n. (7.42)\n\nThis is the quantity published by space organisations like NORAD to calculate\nthe orbital elements.\n\nDaily Recurrence Frequency ?\n\nWe use ? to denote the daily recurrence frequency. This dimensionless\nquantity, which will be important in the study of recurrent orbits in Chap. 11,\nis defined by\n\n? =\nnd\n\n??T ? ??\n. (7.43)\n\nIt is related to the daily orbital frequency ? by\n\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n??T ? ??\n??T ? ??S\n\n= 1 +\n1? P\nN ?yr\n\n. (7.44)\n\n10This quantity is perhaps more meaningful than ?? expressed in radians per second. To\navoid any confusion over units, we have used P for this quantity, expressed in round trips\nper year, whereas other quantities will be expressed in SI units, unless otherwise stated.\nThe quantities P and ?, like ?a and ? a little later on in our discussion, are ratios of angular\nfrequencies, so they are indeed dimensionless numbers.\n\n\n\n266 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\n7.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun\n\nThe aim in studying the apparent motion of the Sun around the Earth is\nto represent the direction of the Sun and to understand different notions of\nsolar time, viz., apparent (or true) and mean solar time.\n\n7.3.1 Celestial Sphere and Coordinates\n\nOn the celestial sphere,11 illustrated in Fig. 7.7, the equator and the ecliptic\n(the Sun\u2019s trajectory) intersect at two points. The point corresponding to the\ndirection of the Sun when its declination crosses zero from below is the vernal\npoint, traditionally denoted by ?. It corresponds to the spring equinox.12 The\ndihedral angle between these two planes, known as the obliquity, is equal to\n? = 23?26?21?? = 23.44?.\n\nThe direction of the Sun can be defined as follows, in two coordinate\nsystems with origin at the center of the Earth.\n\nP\n\n?\n\nO\n\nS\n\nS?\n\nz\nFig. 7.7 : Celestial\n\nsphere, with vernal\n\nequinox (?), the Sun\n\n(S), the equatorial\n\nplane O?S?, the ecliptic\nO?S, the celestial\n\nnorth pole P , and the\n\nmeridian PSS?. In the\nspherical triangle ?SS?,\nthe arc ?S represents\n\nthe celestial longitude\n\nl, the arc ?S? the right\nascension ?, and the\n\narc SS? the declination\n?. The angle at ? is\n\nthe obliquity ? and\n\nthe angle at S? is a\nright-angle.\n\n11One commonly represents directions in space by means of points on a sphere with\narbitrary center and radius, called the celestial sphere. With any particular direction, one\nassociates the point of intersection of the celestial sphere and the straight line in that\ndirection with origin at the center of the sphere.\n\n12The word \u201cvernal\u201d comes from the Latin vernalis, the adjective derived from ver, veris,\nmeaning \u201cspring\u201d.\n\n\n\n7.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun 267\n\n(a) Ecliptic Coordinates. The reference plane is the plane of the Sun\u2019s\napparent trajectory during its annual revolution, known as the plane of the\necliptic, or just the ecliptic. The origin of these coordinates is taken at the\nvernal equinox. The angle of azimuth gives the Sun\u2019s longitude l, also called\nthe celestial longitude or ecliptic longitude. The height angle gives the Sun\u2019s\nlatitude b, called the celestial latitude or ecliptic latitude. By definition, b = 0\ncorresponds to the ecliptic itself.\n\n(b) Celestial Coordinates. The plane of reference is the Earth\u2019s equatorial\nplane. The coordinate origin is taken at the vernal equinox. The angle of\nazimuth is the right ascension ?, the dihedral angle between the meridians in\nthe direction of the Sun and the direction of the vernal equinox. The height\nangle is the declination ?, which is the angle between the direction of the\nSun and the reference plane. By definition, the right ascension is related to\nthe hour angle H and the apparent solar time defined below. Concerning the\ndeclination, it varies during the year in an almost sinusoidal manner, between\nthe bounds ? = ? at the summer solstice and ? = ?? at the winter solstice.\nThe values ? = 0 are attained at the equinoxes. We shall return to this point\nbelow (see Fig. 7.10).\n\n7.3.2 Hour Angle\n\nWe consider an arbitrary point on the Earth (apart from the poles), defined\nby its geocentric coordinates (?, ?) in ?T. The meridian plane through this\nlocation, denoted by M, is the half-plane containing the polar axis and this\npoint. At a given time, we define the meridian plane of the Sun\u2019s direction,\ndenoted by S, as the half-plane containing the polar axis and this direction,\nwith longitude ?S. The dihedral angle between these two half-planes is called\nthe hour angle, denoted by H :\n\nH = dihedral angle (M,S) = ?? ?S . (7.45)\n\nThe angle H is measured in the retrograde sense. This convention can be\nexplained as follows. The idea is that the variations in H and the time should\noccur in the same sense during the day, so that H is negative in the morning,\nzero at midday, and positive in the evening.\n\nThe hour angle (which is in fact an azimuthal angle) can be defined for\nan arbitrary direction. When it is defined specifically for the direction of the\nSun, as here, it is also called the apparent (or true) solar time. The hour angle\nand the apparent solar time are angles, generally given in degrees or hours,\nwhere 1 h corresponds to 15?, since 24 h corresponds to 360?.\n\n7.3.3 Equation of Time\n\nThe apparent solar time defined by the apparent motion of the Sun is a\n\u201cnatural\u201d idea. It is the time given by a sundial. But this motion does not\n\n\n\n268 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nhave the regularity required to form the basis for a time scale. It would be\nregular, or uniform, if the Earth\u2019s orbit were circular and if its plane contained\nthe Earth\u2019s equatorial plane.\n\nEquation of Center\n\nWe consider the position of the Sun as defined by ecliptic coordinates. The\nSun\u2019s trajectory relative to the Earth is not circular, but elliptical. The celes-\ntial longitude l does not therefore vary in a uniform manner, but corresponds\nto the true anomaly v, with a different origin. Indeed,\n\nl = v ? v? , (7.46)\n\ntaking the origin of v at the perigee, which corresponds on average to 3 Jan-\nuary, and the origin of l at the vernal equinox, which corresponds on average\nto 21 March. The true anomaly13 of the vernal equinox is\n\nv? = 77\n? . (7.47)\n\nThe regular motion is characterised by the mean anomaly M , proportional\nto the time elapsed since the passage at perigee. The difference, induced by\nthe nonzero eccentricity, between the elliptical and the uniform motions is\ncharacterised by l ?M or v ?M , which are equal in value up to a constant.\nWe set\n\nEC = v ?M , (7.48)\n\na quantity known as the equation of center, already mentioned in Chap. 4,\nwhere it was defined by (4.90) in the discussion of Keplerian motion.\n\nWhen e is small, as happens for the Earth orbit (e = 0.0167), we have\nseen that this quantity is given by (4.98), viz.,\n\nEC ? 2e sinM . (7.49)\n\nThe function EC is sinusoidal, with period one year and maximum ECm given\nby\n\nECm = 2e = 0.0334 rad .\n\nIts graph is shown by the dashed curve in Fig. 7.8. It is zero twice a year, at\nthe perigee (3 January) and at the apogee (5 July). It reaches its maximum\non 3 April and its minimum on 5 October.\n\n13Keplerian elements with respect to the mean ecliptic and equinox of J2000.0, for Earth\u2013\nMoon Barycentre [JPL-DE405]: ? = 0, ? = 102.93768?180 = ?77.06232, v? = ?? ? 77?.\n\n\n\n7.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun 269\n\nReduction to the Equator\n\nWe now consider the Sun\u2019s position as defined by celestial equatorial co-\nordinates. The equatorial plane makes an angle ? with the ecliptic, as defined\nabove. It follows that the right ascension ? does not vary uniformly with the\nlongitude l.\n\nThe celestial sphere is represented in Fig. 7.7, where O is the center of the\nEarth, P the celestial north pole, ? the vernal equinox, S the position of the\nSun, and S? the intersection of the meridian half-plane of S with the celestial\nequator. Concerning the spherical triangle ?SS?, the angles and sides (arcs)\nare:\n\nangle ? = ? , angleS? = ?/2 ,\n\n\n\n\n?S= l ,\n\n\n\n?S?= ? ,\n\n\n\nSS?= ? .\n\nWe would like to express ? as a function of ? and l. Using (ST XIII), we obtain\n\ncot l sin? = cos? cos ? , hence sin? cos l = cos? sin l cos ? .\n\nExpressing cos ? in terms of the tangent of the half-angle, this implies that\n\nsin? cos l\n(\n1 + tan2\n\n?\n\n2\n\n)\n= cos? sin l\n\n(\n1? tan2 ?\n\n2\n\n)\n,\n\nwhence\n\nsin(?? l) = ? tan2 ?\n2\nsin(?+ l) . (7.50)\n\nThe proximity of ? and l is thus expressed in terms of the obliquity ?, and we\nmay write\n\n? ? l ? tan2 ?\n2\nsin 2l . (7.51)\n\nThe reduction to the equator is defined as\n\nER = ?? l . (7.52)\n\nThis characterises the discrepancy, introduced by the obliquity, between the\ntrue motion and uniform motion.\n\nIn the argument of the sine function, we may put l ? M ?v? , which yields\n\nER ? ? tan2\n?\n\n2\nsin 2(M ? v?) . (7.53)\n\nThis function ER is sinusoidal, with biannual period, and has a maximum\nERm given by\n\nERm = tan\n2 ?\n\n2\n= 0.0431 rad .\n\nIt goes to zero four times a year, at the two equinoxes (21 March and 23\nSeptember) and at the two solstices (21 June and 22 December). Its graph is\nshown by the dash-dotted curve in Fig. 7.8.\n\n\n\n270 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nEquation of Time\n\nConsider the apparent motion of the Sun relative to the Earth. Its position\nis defined by the right ascension ?. The position that it would have in a\nuniform motion of the same period is defined by the mean anomalyM . Taking\nthe same origin, viz., the vernal equinox, we must therefore compare ?, which\ncharacterises the apparent solar time, with M ? v? , which characterises the\nmean solar time. The difference between these two angles is called the equation\nof time ET :\n\nET = ?? (M ? v?) = ?? l+ l ?M + v? = (?? l) + (v ?M) .\nThis shows that the equation of time is the sum of the two quantities EC and\nER defined above:\n\nET = EC + ER . (7.54)\n\nIt thus has the value\n\nET = 2e sinM ? tan2\n?\n\n2\nsin 2(M ? v?) . (7.55)\n\nRecall that M = n(t ? tp), with n = 2?/T , where T is equal to one year\n(strictly speaking, one anomalistic year). The mean value of ET over the year\nis zero by definition.\n\nTo the accuracy required here, it is convenient to consider the period equal\nto one civil year of 365 days and to characterise M by the day D of the year,\ntaking the beginning of the year as zero point, i.e., D = 1 for 1 January,\nD = 2 for 2 January, . . . , D = 365 for 31 December. Then, with the passage\nat perigee for D = 3, and noting that 78 ? 77\u00d7 365/360, we have\n\nM =\n360\n\n365\n(D ? 3) , v? = 77 (7.56)\n\nM ? v? =\n360\n\n365\n(D ? 3)? 77 =\n\n360\n[\n(D ? 3)? 78\n\n]\n365\n\n=\n360\n\n365\n(D ? 81) . (7.57)\n\nTo express ET in time units, we convert radians to minutes of time. In one trip\nround the orbit, the right ascension changes by 24 h, so 2? rad is equivalent to\n1,440min. Finally, expressing the arguments of the sine function in degrees,\nwe obtain\n\nET(D)[min] = 7.64 sin\n\n[\n360\n\n365\n(D ? 3)\n\n]\n? 9.87 sin\n\n[\n720\n\n365\n(D ? 81)\n\n]\n. (7.58)\n\nWith this simplified formula, which is quite adequate for most situations,\nwe observe that the two effects decouple in ET. The eccentricity affects EC\nand the obliquity affects ER. This is due to the fact that the quantities e\nand tan2(?/2) are much smaller than unity. Extremely detailed and precise\nexpressions for ET can be found in the astronomical literature.\n\nFigure 7.8 shows a graph of ET calculated using (7.58), noting the maxima,\nminima, and zeros. In particular, we see that the equation of time varies with\nan amplitude of one quarter of an hour and goes to zero four times a year.\n\n\n\n7.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun 271\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 365\nDay of the Year\n\nE\nqu\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nof\n\n ti\nm\n\ne \n(m\n\nin\n)\n\nDay D Day+month ET [min]\n\n45 14 Feb +14.30\n107 17 Apr 0\n135 15 May ?3.60\n166 15 Jun 0\n207 26 Jul +6.37\n244 01 Sep 0\n305 01 Nov ?16.43\n359 25 Dec 0\n\nFig. 7.8 :Graph of the equation of time as a function of the day of the year D.

The sign convention in the definition of ET sometimes changes, depend-\ning on the field of study, as does the convention for geographical longitudes.\nOne must therefore exercise some caution over the sign used for calculations.\n\n\n\n272 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\n7.3.4 Solar Time\n\nUniversal Time and Mean Solar Time\n\nUniversal time UT, or more exactly UT1 (see Chap. 6), is related to the\nEarth\u2019s rotation. At an arbitrary location with longitude ?, we define the local\nmean solar time LMT by\n\nLMT = UT +\n?\n\n15\n(? in degree, time in hour) , (7.59)\n\nwith the convention for the longitudes (?W/+E) already mentioned. UT is\nthus the mean solar time at the Greenwich meridian,14 i.e., the zero meridian.\n\nMean Solar Time and Apparent Solar Time\n\nWith the above calculations,15 we see that the equation of time, the sum\nof EC and ER, is the amount (see Fig. 7.9) by which the local mean solar time\n(LMT) exceeds the local apparent solar time (LAT):\n\nET = LMT? LAT . (7.60)\nThe civil time at a given location is the mean solar time at this location\nincreased by 12h. Throughout the rest of this book, the solar times we refer\nto will be civil times. Noting the value at noon, we have the relation\n\nH = 0 ?? LAT = 12 h , LMT = 12 h +ET .\nIn the following, t will denote the time in UT and ? the corresponding time\nin LMT. At a place with longitude ?, we then have\n\n?(t, ?) = ? = t+\n?\n\n15\n. (7.61)\n\nTime on the LMT scale is also called local time, while time on the LAT scale\nis called solar time.\n\nExample 7.4 The Russian satellite Resurs-O1-4 was launched on 10 July\n1998, at 06:30 UT from the Baikonur base in Kazakhstan. Calculate the time\non the LMT and LAT time scales at this location and time.\n\n? The geographical coordinates of the Baikonur space center are 68?16? E;\n45?38? N. Hence, for the longitude ? = +68.27?, and the local mean time is\n\nLMT+ 68.27/15 = UT + 4.551 = 06h 30min + 4h 33min = 11h 03min .\n\n14The old name of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is judged inappropriate by astronomers\nand has been out of use for several decades. It should be avoided, even though it still turns\nup in certain contexts.\n\n15To these irregularities in the apparent solar time correspond variations in the length\nof the apparent solar day, i.e., the time elapsed between two consecutive solar noons. This\nvaries between 23 h 59min 39 s and 24 h 00min 30 s.\n\n\n\n7.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun 273\n\nFig. 7.9 :The equation of time specifies the difference between the time we read on a\n\nsundial (LAT) and the time we read on our watch (effectively LMT). The author\u2019s\n\nown sundial in Anga??s (Pyre?ne?es\u2013Atlantiques, France). Photos: M. C.\n\nThe date enters the equation of time: ET(D = 191) = 5.2 min. We thus obtain\nthe apparent solar time as\n\nLAT = LMT? ET = 11h 03 min? 0 h 05min = 10h 58min .\n\nIn conclusion, at Baikonur, the time 06:30 UT corresponds to 11:03 LMT and\n10:58 LAT. ?\n\n7.3.5 Declination\n\nThe solar declination is very simply expressed as a function of the Sun\u2019s\ncelestial longitude l and the obliquity ?. Considering the right-angled spherical\n\n\n\n274 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\ntriangle shown in Fig. 7.7 and using the values of the angles given in the figure\ncaption or the section describing the reduction to the equator, we may use\nthe sine rule (ST VIII) from spherical trigonometry to show that\n\nsin ? = sin l sin ? . (7.62)\n\nClearly, we obtain the declination ? in terms of the date (via the mean\nanomaly M). Using the equation of center, we have from (7.46), (7.47), and\n(7.49),\n\nl = v ? v? = M + 2e sinM ? v? = (M ? v?) + 2e sinM . (7.63)\n\nWe use the day of the year D (D = 1 to D = 365). With (7.56) and (7.57),\nwe have seen how M and M ? v? are related to D. For angles expressed in\ndegrees, as is usual, we must give the eccentricity e in degrees, multiplying it\nby the coefficient of conversion from radians to degrees:\n\ne = 0.0167\u00d7 180/? = 0.96? .\n\nThis gives\n\nsin ? = sin ? sin\n\n[\n360\n\n365\n(D ? 81) + 1.92 sin 360\n\n365\n(D ? 3)\n\n]\n, (7.64)\n\nor putting in the numerical value of the obliquity,\n\n?(D) = arcsin\n\n{\n0.39795 sin\n\n[\n360\n\n365\n(D ? 81) + 1.92 sin 360\n\n365\n(D ? 3)\n\n]}\n. (7.65)\n\nWe recall that the value from (7.49) is approximate (although a very good\napproximation here). Equation (7.65) gives the declination to within 0.2?,\nwhich is quite adequate when studying solar angles, with dates defined in a\nwhole number of days. (The apparent diameter of the Sun is 0.5?, and the\nvariation of ? is 0.4? a day near the equinoxes.)\n\nThe variation of the declination with date is shown in Fig. 7.10. The signif-\nicant dates are indicated. Note that the lengths of the seasons, as defined by\n90? intervals of solar longitude, are unequal. The passage at perigee (3 Jan-\nuary) is, in our century, close to the winter solstice (22 December), and the\nseasons close to these dates (autumn and winter) are shorter than the seasons\nnear the passage at apogee. This is just an example of Kepler\u2019s second law,\nthe areal law.\n\n7.3.6 Julian Day, Julian Date\n\nIn order to calculate the time difference between two given dates, or to\nidentify a particular date in history without ambiguity, we use the Julian\nday. The days are counted one after the next, without bringing in reference\n\n\n\n7.3 Apparent Motion of the Sun 275\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n-30\n\n-25\n\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 365\nDay of the Year\n\nD\n\u00e9c\n\nlin\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(d\neg\n\n)\n\nDay D Day+month ?

Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nto month or year, and without discontinuity when a change is made in the\ncalendar. The zero point is taken in a sufficiently remote past to incorporate\nhistorical events.16\n\nThe Julian date (JD) corresponds to the Julian day increased by the frac-\ntion of the day as counted from 12h. On 1 January 2000, we then have the\nfollowing correspondence between the date of the Gregorian calendar and the\nJulian date:\n\n2000-01-01 12:00:00 ?? JD = 2,451,545.0 . (7.66)\n\nWe shall use this notion of Julian date for the NORAD orbital elements in\nChap. 8, and for calculations relating to the orbit of Mars in Chap. 16.\n\nOne can also use the modified Julian date (MJD), obtained from the Julian\ndate as follows17:\n\nMJD = JD? 2,400,000.5 . (7.67)\n\n7.4 Geosynchronicity\n\n7.4.1 Definition\n\nWe consider the Earth\u2019s rotation and the rotation of a satellite S in the\nGalilean frame ?. The satellite is said to be geosynchronous if its motion\n\n16Joseph Juste Scaliger (1540\u20131609), the French scholar, proposed a new chronology in\nhis De emendatione temporum (On the correction of time) in 1583. His idea was to produce\na continuous count of the years in such a way as to cover all the great civilisations. He called\nthis the Julian system, by analogy with the Julian calendar (introduced by Julius Caesar).\nThe Julian numbering system, quoted by Kepler, was used by astronomers from 1860. They\nthen added the idea of Julian day and Julian date. Scaliger considered the cycles involved in\ncalculating the date of Easter, which was a major concern for astronomers in the Christian\nworld:\n\n\u2022 The solar cycle (or dominical cycle) of 28 years (7 times 4, with 7 being the number of\ndays in the week, and there being one leap year every 4 years).\n\n\u2022 The lunar cycle (the golden number, or the Metonic cycle) of 19 years (235 lunations in\n19 years).\n\n\u2022 The cycle of indiction, of 15 years (a number of historical rather than astronomical\nsignificance).\n\nTo each year there corresponds a set of three numbers, one for each cycle. Every 28\u00d719\u00d715 =\n7,980 year, the years return to the same values for the three cycles (28, 19, and 15 being\ncoprime). Scaliger chose as origin the year when the numbers of the cycles were all equal\nto 1. In an imaginary Gregorian calendar, this corresponds to the date Monday 1 January\n?4712, 12 h. This year (4713 bc) is a leap year.\n\n17A total of 2,400,000 days are removed from the Julian date, giving an origin on 17\nNovember 1858, and the origin is taken at midnight rather than at midday.\n\n\n\n7.4 Geosynchronicity 277\n\naround the Earth and the rotation of the Earth about its axis have the same\nangular frequency, i.e., if the mean motion n of the satellite is equal to ??T, i.e.,\n\ngeosynchronous satellite ?? n = ??T . (7.68)\n\nThis condition can be met by a satellite whose orbital elements e and i are\nnonzero. However, in practice, what one usually seeks in a geosynchronous mo-\ntion is that the projection S0 of the satellite position on the Earth\u2019s surface\nshould be immobile (in the frame ?T). The satellite is then said to be geosta-\ntionary and this point S0 is called the subsatellite point of the geostationary\nsatellite.\n\nTo achieve this, the vectors representing the Earth\u2019s rotation and the satel-\nlite\u2019s rotation should be equal. Concerning their directions, they must there-\nfore be collinear. As the Earth\u2019s rotation vector lies along the polar axis Oz,\nthe same must also be true for the rotation vector of S. Since the orbit of S\nis planar and this plane must contain the center of attraction O, the center of\nthe Earth, it must lie in the equatorial plane (whence i = 0). The magnitudes\nof these vectors are equal since the satellite is geosynchronous. As the value of\n??T is constant, the motion of S must be uniform, whereupon the subsatellite\npoint will be stationary. The orbit of S must therefore be circular, i.e., with\nconstant altitude:\n\ngeostationary satellite ??\n\n??\n?\n\nn = ??T ,\ni = 0 ,\nh = constant .\n\n(7.69)\n\nA geostationary satellite is thus geosynchronous.18 The converse is not always\ntrue, e.g., Tundra-type orbit. Its position is determined by the longitude of the\nsubsatellite point, called the parking longitude of the geostationary satellite.\n\n7.4.2 Calculating the Orbit\n\nTo calculate the radius of the circular orbit of S, we begin by considering\nthe value of the Keplerian mean motion. Setting n0 = ??T, we obtain\n\na30 =\n?\n\n??2T\n= 7.4960128\u00d7 1022 ,\n\na0 = 42,164.159 km , h0 = 35,786 km .\n\n18In ?, the satellite is synchronous, whilst in ?T, it is stationary. The word geosyn-\nchronous, meaning \u201csynchronised with the Earth\u201d, takes its origins from the Greek roots\nand is more satisfying than the word \u201cgeostationary\u201d, which is a Greek\u2013Latin hybrid.\n\n\n\n278 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nUsing the iterative method to obtain the altitude from the period, as illus-\ntrated in Example 7.3, we obtain\n\na1 = 42,164.199 km , h1 = 35,786 km .\n\nAt this altitude, as can be seen from Fig. 6.1, the main perturbation no longer\ncomes from the J2 term in the geopotential, but from the lunisolar potential.\nIterative calculations like those considered previously are no longer suited\nto the problem. By studying the various perturbations (indeed, rather weak\ncompared with the leading term), one can extract the precise value of the\norbital radius, which we shall indicate here with a subscript GS to denote\ngeostationary:\n\naGS = 42,165.785 km , hGS = 35,788 km , (7.70)\n\nor as a function of the Earth\u2019s equatorial radius R :\n\naGS = 6.611R , hGS = 5.611R . (7.71)\n\nIn terms of the reduced distance ?, we have\n\n?GS =\naGS\nR\n\n= 6.611 . (7.72)\n\n7.4.3 Geostationary Satellites\n\nIt is easy to grasp the importance of the geostationary satellite. The point\nis that it always \u201cviews\u201d the same regions, and with the same geometry (as we\nshall see in Chap. 14). For communications satellites and Earth-observation\nsatellites, these are crucial points. For example, such a position allows a\nweather satellite to make a \u201cfilm\u201d in real time, with one image every 15min,\nshowing the development of cloud formations.\n\nIt is just as easy to see the drawbacks of this kind of orbit. A geostationary\nsatellite cannot view the whole of the Earth\u2019s surface, either in longitude\n(which explains why one must arrange several of them at different longitudes),\nor in latitude (regions above 55? are difficult to attain in this way). Moreover,\none is forced to view from a great distance.\n\nHistorical Note on Geosynchronous Satellites\n\nGeosynchronous orbits have been a target since the beginnings of the space\nage, starting with the US satellite series called Syncom (Synchronous Com-\nmunications Satellite), experimental communications satellites19 (mass 39 kg).\nThe first, Syncom-1, i = 33.3?, was lost at launch. The next, Syncom-2,\n\n19Launch dates: Syncom-1 on 14 February 1961, Syncom-2 on 26 July 1963, and Syncom-3\non 19 August 1964.\n\n\n\n7.4 Geosynchronicity 279\n\ni = 32.8?, was the first geosynchronous satellite. It provided the first tele-\nphone link between the Bight of Benin and the United States, on 31 July\n1963 (see the upper panel of Fig. 9.16). Syncom-3 can be considered as the\nfirst geostationary satellite, since its inclination was i = 0.1?. It is thanks to\nthis satellite that the Tokyo Olympic Games of 1964 could be followed live in\nthe United States.\n\nSatellites in the subsequent ATS series (Applications Technology Satellite)\nwere already much bigger (mass 930 kg for ATS-6).20 The Intelsat series (In-\nternational Telecommunications Satellite Organisation) was the first family of\ncommercial communications satellites.21\n\nThe first images from geostationary satellites were those taken by ATS-1\nand ATS-3, but the first meteorological satellites on this orbit belonged to\nthe SMS series (Synchronous Meteorological Satellite), launched in 1974 and\n1975, SMS-1 with i = 15.5? and SMS-2 with i = 12.0?. They were followed by\nthe GOES series, from GOES-1 (SMS-3 operational) at i = 12.4? to GOES-7\nat i = 1.2?. For the GOES-Next series, starting with GOES-8, orbits were\nequatorial, with i ? 0.2?.\n\nThe first Soviet geostationary satellite was placed in orbit much later,\nsuch satellites being of little use to a country like Russia. This was Kosmos-\n637, launched on 26 March 1974 with i = 14.5?. Shortly afterwards, the\nFrench\u2013German communications satellite Symphonie-1 was launched, on 19\nDecember 1974, with i = 14.9?. The first satellite of the European organisation\nESA was METEOSAT-1, launched in 1977 with i = 11.9?. Since 1990, these\nmeteorological satellites have been placed on near-equatorial (i < 1.5?), near-\ncircular (e ? 2\u00d7 10?4) orbits.\n\nOn 1 January 2010, there were more than a 1,000 satellites on near-\ngeostationary geosynchronous orbits (in fact, 1,186 objects measuring more\nthan 1m across), including 381 in operation, and among them, 239 for com-\nmunications and 16 for meteorology.\n\nRegarding the problem of solar eclipse faced by geostationary satellites,\nsee Chap. 10.\n\n20Apart from two failures, for ATS-2 and -4, all the satellites were placed on slightly\ninclined orbits. Launch dates: ATS-1 on 7 December 1966, i = 14.5?, remained operational\nfor 18 years, until April 1985, ATS-3 on 5 November 1967, i = 14.5?, ATS-5 on 12 August\n1969, i = 14.5?, and ATS-6 on 30 May 1974, i = 13.1?.\n\n21The first in the series was Intelsat-1 F-1, also known as Early Bird, launched on 6 April\n1965, i = 14.7? (stationed over the Atlantic to establish \u201cfixed\u201d telephone links between\nEurope and the United States). Since then the Intelsat satellites have been launched on a\nregular basis and placed over the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. An intergovernmental\nconsortium set up in 1964, Intelsat became a private company in 2001. After taking over\nPanAmSat in 2006, Intelsat has 55 satellites in operation at the time of writing (2013).\n\n\n\n280 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\n7.4.4 Drift of the Geostationary Orbit\n\nThe geostationary satellite undergoes the effects of various perturbations,\ncausing it to drift from its course as time goes by. In other words, the sub-\nsatellite point S0 is no longer exactly the assigned reference point. There are\ntwo kinds of drift: longitudinal drift and latitudinal drift.\n\nLongitudinal Drift\n\nFor meteorological satellites, the longitudinal drift of S0 can be compen-\nsated, if it is not too great, by correcting the transmitted image. A very slight\nvariation in a causes this shift and the satellite is then no longer geosyn-\nchronous. If a increases, the period also increases and the mean motion de-\ncreases. Hence, the satellite rotates less quickly than the Earth in ?, whence\nthe subsatellite point S0 moves westward in ?T. Likewise, if a decreases, S0\nmoves eastward. This phenomenon is shown schematically in Fig. 7.11 (see\nalso the lower panel of Fig. 5.3).\n\nGeostationary\nOrbit\n\nEarth\n\nt = t0\n\nt = t1\n\nFig. 7.11 :Orbit of a geostationary satellite and two other satellites at higher and\n\nlower altitudes than those required by geosychronicity. At time t = t0, the three\n\nsatellites have the same subsatellite point. At time t = t1, the subsatellite point of\n\nthe lowest satellite has slipped eastward, while that of the highest satellite has slipped\n\nwestward, relative to the subsatellite point of the geostationary satellite. The diagram\n\nshows the Earth viewed from a point located high above the North Pole in the Galilean\n\nframe \n.\n\n\n\n7.4 Geosynchronicity 281\n\nWe shall calculate the displacement ?1l of the subsatellite point over one\nday for a variation ?a in the orbital radius (or altitude). In ?, the subsatellite\npoint of a geostationary satellite moves a distance l between times t0 and t1,\nwhere\n\nl = R??T(t1 ? t0) .\n\nIn ?, the subsatellite point of a satellite with mean motion n moves through\na distance l? in the same time, where\n\nl? = Rn(t1 ? t0) .\n\nThe difference measures the deviation in ?, or in ?T, which is the drift we\nseek here:\n\nl? ? l = R(n? ??T)(t1 ? t0) .\n\nIf the second satellite is close to the geostationary orbit, with a = aGS +?a\nand n = ??T +?n, we have the relation\n\ndn\n\nn\n= ?3\n\n2\n\nda\n\na\n=? ?n\n\n??T\n? ?3\n\n2\n\n?a\n\naGS\n,\n\nand setting ?l = l? ? l, we have\n\n?l = R?n(t1 ? t0) = ?\n3\n\n2\n?a\n\nR\n\naGS\n??T(t1 ? t0) .\n\nThe value ?GS = aGS/R is determined by (7.72) for a geostationary satellite.\nIf we consider a time interval of exactly one day, t1 ? t0 = DM, we may\n\nexpress ??TDM using (7.32). This gives ?1l (the subscript 1 indicates that we\nare considering a time interval of 1 day), the displacement of the subsatellite\npoint over one day:\n\n?1l = ?\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n6.611\n2?\n\n366.25\n\n365.25\n?a = ?1.4295?a (per day) . (7.73)\n\nThe sign here is valid if we apply the usual conventions concerning the longi-\ntudes for ?l, i.e., negative for west and positive for east (?W/+ E).\n\nWe now apply this to two examples. In the first, we calculate the drift of\na satellite that is not exactly at the required altitude, and in the second, we\nshow how one may take advantage of this drift to modify the position of the\nsatellite.\n\nExample 7.5 Calculate the longitudinal drift over one week of the subsatellite\npoint of a geostationary satellite whose altitude has increased by 100m.\n\n? With ?a = ?h = 100m, (7.73) gives ?l = ?143m/day. The position of the\nsubsatellite point on the ground thus moves 1.0 km westward in one week. ?\n\n\n\n282 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nExample 7.6 As part of the INDOEX project (Indian Ocean Experiment),\nthe European organisation of meteorological satellites EUMETSAT decided to\nmove the satellite METEOSAT-5 from its standby position (10 ?W) to a new\nposition above the Indian ocean (63 ?E). The method used consisted in shifting\nthe satellite to a lower orbit, whereupon it would drift eastward. Indeed, leaving\nits initial geostationary position on 14 January 1998, it arrived at its new\ngeostationary position on 19 May 1998. Calculate how much the radius of the\norbit was adjusted to make this transfer.\n\n? The departure and arrival dates were D = 14 and D = 139, respectively,\nseparated by 125 days. Since it takes 12 h to go from one orbit to the other,\nwe consider that the transfer took 124 days. The distance between the two\npositions is 73?. The satellite therefore had to move through 73/124 = 0.589?\n\nper day relative to the Earth, which corresponds to 65.53 km per day on the\nground track. Since the shift was eastward, we thus have ?l = 65.53km/day.\nApplying (7.73), we find\n\n?a = ? ?l\n1.4295\n\n= ?45.84 km .\n\nThe satellite was therefore placed on an orbit 46 km lower. Note that only the\ntwo maneuvers at the beginning and the end required energy input, while the\ntrip itself cost nothing.22 ?\n\nLatitudinal Drift\n\nLatitudinal variations of S0 (in which S therefore moves slightly outside the\nequatorial plane under the action of gravitational forces of the Moon and Sun)\nshow up through a distortion of the ground track. The orbit is slightly tilted\nwith respect to the equatorial plane (i ?= 0). During the day, the subsatellite\npoint is not fixed but varies between latitudes ? = +i and ? = ?i. If the orbit\nremains circular, the intersection of the straight line OS (joining the center\nof the Earth O to the satellite S) with the horizontal equatorial plane of the\nnode of the orbit traces out a figure of 8, as can be seen in Fig. 9.16 (upper).\nThis is not a Bernoulli lemniscate (see Example 8.4).\n\n7.4.5 Stationkeeping\n\nThe art of maintaining geostationary satellites in position has been the\nsubject of considerable scientific effort. On the one hand, the problem requires\n\n22The speed of the transfer does have an energy cost. The faster one needs to go, the\nlower the transfer orbit should be. For each transfer maneuver of METEOSAT-5 in the\nabove example, which required two burns, one on the starting orbit and one on the final\norbit, EUMETSAT indicate that 300 g of fuel were burnt. The satellite was carrying 6 kg\nof propellant before the move.\n\n\n\n7.4 Geosynchronicity 283\n\nspecially adapted tools, for the geostationary orbit is highly specific, with\ne = 0 and i = 0, whence the angles ? and ? are undetermined. On the other\nhand, the economic stakes are significant. The satellites on these orbits are\nvery costly and may represent huge profits, so there is no question of allowing\nthem to drift out of orbit.\n\nStationkeeping involves repositioning a satellite within its \u201cwindow\u201d after\na certain time. (A typical window would constitute about 1? in the east\u2013west\ndirection, and ?0.1? to +0.1? in the north\u2013south direction.) Stationkeeping\noperations require maneuvers in which fuel is burnt, and this necessarily puts\na limit on the lifetime of the satellite. North\u2013south control represents the\ngreater part of the fuel consumption involved in stationkeeping.23\n\nThe orbit of a geosynchronous satellite evolves as time goes by:\n\n\u2022 The semi-major axis a evolves under the effect of tesseral terms in the\ngeopotential.\n\n\u2022 The eccentricity e (since the distorted orbit is no longer circular) changes\nunder the influence of solar radiation and the lunisolar attraction.\n\n\u2022 The inclination i is affected mainly by the Sun and Moon, since the plane\nof the ecliptic in which the Sun appears to move is tilted at 23? to the\nplane of the satellite orbit (the Earth\u2019s equatorial plane), and the plane of\nthe lunar orbit also lies in the plane of the ecliptic, to within 5?.\n\nWe now give closer examination to the evolution of a.\n\nLongitudinal Acceleration\n\nIf a geostationary satellite is left to evolve without further intervention, it\nwill tend to move toward points of specific longitude on the Earth\u2019s equator,\ndepending on where it started out. This effect is largely a manifestation of\nthe tesseral harmonic P22. The terms C22 and S22 are nonzero, whereas they\nare taken as zero in any model with cylindrical symmetry [see (3.24)]. We\nshall calculate this drift by ascertaining its longitudinal acceleration, first by\nexpanding the geopotential to second order, then going to third order.\n\n(a) Second Order Expansion of the Geopotential. We return to (3.23),\nin which we set C11 = 0 and S11 = 0. (As we have seen, this comes from the\nfact that the coordinate origin is chosen at the center of mass.) Introducing\nthe Legendre functions and polynomials, we obtain\n\n23For the satellite TDF-1, north\u2013south control represents 95% of its consumption.\nLaunched in 1988, this satellite was held in position throughout its period of use. It was\nthen placed in a graveyard orbit, where it was allowed to drift.\n\n\n\n284 Chapter 7.

A satellite stationed at longitude ? = 0? is subject to an acceleration\n??(0?) = 0.737 \u00d7 10?3 deg day?2.

The Chinese positioning system uses two geostationary satellites, Beidou-\n1A and -1B. Their positions must be very accurately known (see Chap. 14).\nThe effective stationing longitude ?S of each satellite must remain very close\nto the nominal longitude ?S0, to within a very tight margin:\n\n?S = ?S0 \u00b1 0.1? .\n\nFor the satellite Beidou-1A, the values of ?S are noted in Fig. 7.13 as a func-\ntion of time over a period of two and half years.

This negative\nacceleration, i.e., d2?/dt2 < 0, tells us that the satellite tends to move west-\nward toward the stable point 75?E. When it approaches the longitude 139.85?,\nits engines are started so as to reduce the altitude of the satellite. This causes\nit to slip eastward to 140.05? or 140.10?.

The period can be fixed at one (sidereal) day so as to obtain a\ngeosynchronous satellite.\n\nThe Tundra-type orbit was studied by both Russia and Canada and the\nidea taken up again by the European Space Agency (ESA) for its Archimedes\nproject. Two different orbits are planned: Tundra (or Tundra 2) and Super-\ntundra (or Tundra 1), with the value a = 42,163 km almost independent of\nthe eccentricity and very close to aGS as given by (7.70). Since the values of\nthe inclination and period are determined, we have:\n\n\u2022 For Tundra, e = 0.2668, hp = 24,536km, ha = 47,034km.\n\u2022 For Supertundra, e = 0.4230, hp = 17,950 km, ha = 53,620 km.\n\nThe visibility time, over which the satellite is visible under acceptable geomet-\nrical conditions for the relevant regions (see Chap. 13), is 8 h for the first of\nthese orbits and 12 h for the second, once the position of the apogee has been\ncorrectly established. This means that three and two satellites are needed,\nrespectively, to achieve permanent coverage. Under such conditions, we may\nsay that we have obtained the equivalent of one geostationary satellite but at\nhigh latitude.\n\nThe Tundra orbit has been used successfully since 2000 by the SD-Radio\nconstellation of US communications satellites.24\n\n24The three satellites Sirius-1, -2, and -3 (also called SD-Radio-1, -2, and -3), launched\nfrom Kazakhstan on 30 June, 5 September, and 30 November 2000, are on a geosynchronous\n\n\n\n7.5 Sun-Synchronicity 291\n\n7.5 Sun-Synchronicity\n\n7.5.1 Definition\n\nThe orbital plane P of the satellite rotates in ?, about the polar axis, at a\nrate ??, which characterises the angular speed of the vector ON in the plane\nE , where O is the center of the Earth and N the ascending node, as shown in\nFig. 5.1.\n\nWe seek a type of orbit in which the passage at the ascending node always\noccurs at the same solar time. We thus require ON to make a constant angle\nwith the direction of the Sun, since the hour angle (and hence the local mean\ntime) is the dihedral angle between the meridian plane of the relevant point\n(here N) and the plane containing the polar axis and the Sun. For this to\nhappen, the nodal precession rate ?? must equal the angular speed of the\nEarth\u2019s motion around the Sun. Such a satellite is said to be Sun-synchronous\nor heliosynchronous:\n\nSun-synchronous satellite ?? ?? = ??S . (7.95)\n\nA satellite with an elliptical orbit can be Sun-synchronous, in which case the\nnodal precession rate is given in the form ?? = ??(a, e, i). We shall return to\nthis case below, with the example of the satellite Ellipso Borealis. However, in\nmost cases, and in particular for Earth-observation satellites,25 only circular\nand near-circular orbits are used, so that ?? = ??(a, i).\n\nThe ground track of a Sun-synchronous satellite always crosses a given\nlatitude at the same time (local mean time), which is not the crossing time\nof the ascending node, and which becomes ever further away from it as one\nmoves away from the equator.\n\nIf P is the nodal precession rate in round trips per year, the condition for\nSun-synchronicity can clearly be written\n\nP = 1 . (7.96)\n\n7.5.2 Constant of Sun-Synchronicity\n\nThe condition (7.95) and the values of K0 and ??S defined by (7.5)\nand (7.20) lead us to define a quantity kh by\n\norbit: e = 0.2700, hp = 24,400 km, ha = 47,170 km. They are operational for North America\nbetween longitudes 60?W and 140?W, and broadcast paying music programmes for car\nradios. Between 2001 and 2006, this music-loving private operator sent the four satellites\nRock and Roll, then Rythm and Blues, into geostationary orbit.\n\n25Satellites devoted to magnetospheric studies are often placed in elliptical Sun-\nsynchronous orbits. Examples are MagSat, \u00d8rsted, or the two German satellites Aeros-1\nand -2. One should also mention those satellites whose orbits, originally intended to be\ncircular, have become elliptical owing to launch errors, e.g., Nimbus-1, mentioned below.\n\n\n\n292 Chapter 7.

(7.98)\n\nThis dimensionless constant kh, which we shall call the constant of Sun-\nsynchronicity, plays a very important role in the study of satellites. It depends\nonly on:\n\n\u2022 Characteristics of the planet playing host to the satellite, such as the mass\n(via ?), radius (R) (in fact the mass per unit volume ?o), and the flattening\n(the ellipticity factor J2 of the potential).\n\n\u2022 The motion of the planet around the Sun, determining the sidereal year\nTsid.\n\nIt can also be expressed in terms of the Keplerian period of the satellite at\naltitude 0, where it clearly appears as a ratio of periods:\n\nkh =\n3\n\n2\n\nTsid\nT0(h=0)\n\nJ2 , (7.99)\n\nor again, using the notation of (7.9),\n\nkh =\n3G\n4?\n\nJ2\n?\n?o Tsid . (7.100)\n\nThis constant arises when considering the conditions for Sun-synchronicity,\nbut also more generally, in all aspects of the motion of the satellite orbit\nrelative to its host planet and the Sun.\n\nFor the Earth, it has the value\n\nkh = 10.10949 . (7.101)\n\nThis value of the constant, kh ? 10.11, means that, for a satellite of altitude\nh = 0 and inclination i = 0, the nodal precession rate is 10.11 times greater\nthan the angular speed of the Earth\u2019s axis in its motion around the Sun\n(absolute value).\n\n7.5.3 Calculating the Orbit: Circular Case\n\nSun-Synchronous Inclination\n\nEquations (7.4)\u2013(7.7), together with (7.95) and (7.97) give\n\n??(a, i) = ??S ?? ?\n1\n\ncos i\n\n( a\nR\n\n)7/2\n= kh .

(7.103)\n\nThis gives ? as a function of i :\n\n? = (?kh cos i)2/7 (7.104)\n\nor i as a function of ? :\n\ni = arccos\n\n(\n??\n\n7/2\n\nkh\n\n)\n. (7.105)\n\nWe thus see that:\n\n\u2022 The quantities i and a are related, so that, if we choose one, the other is\nthereby fixed.\n\n\u2022 The value of cos i must be negative for this equality to hold, which shows\nthat a Sun-synchronous orbit is necessarily retrograde.\n\nFigure 7.14 shows the curve of ? (or a, or h) as a function of i. In general,\nthe quantity a is chosen and the value of i is then deduced from (7.105), in\n\n\n\n294 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nwhich case it is called the inclination of the Sun-synchronous orbit, or more\nelliptically, the Sun-synchronous inclination. In this case, we may attach26 the\nsubscript HS to i, writing iHS = iHS(a) = i(a).\n\nBounds on i and h for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nThe minimum value of iHS, written iHSmin or im, is obtained for h = 0,\ni.e., for a fictitious satellite revolving at ground level. With ? = 1, we have\n\niHSmin = im = arccos\n\n(\n? 1\nkh\n\n)\n= arccos(?0.0989) = 95.7? . (7.106)\n\nThe maximum value of h, written hHSmax, is obtained for i = 180\n?:\n\n?HSmax = (kh)\n2/7 = 1.9367 , (7.107)\n\naHSmax = 12,331 km , hHSmax = 5,964 km . (7.108)\n\nIt is therefore impossible to have a Sun-synchronous satellite (in near-circular\norbit) at inclination lower than 96?, or altitude above about 6,000km.\n\nCalculations for a Standard Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nMost Sun-synchronous satellites currently operating have altitude around\n800km (between 700 and 900km for remote sensing, and lower for recon-\nnaissance missions). Figure 7.14 shows that, at these altitudes, the relation\nbetween iHS and h is almost linear.\n\nLet us now examine the variation of i near the central value for the range\nof altitudes mentioned here, i.e., h1 = 800km. The inclination corresponding\nto this altitude h1 is i1 = iHS1 = 98.60\n\n?. Differentiating (7.103), we obtain\n\n7\n\n2\n\nda\n\na\n= ? tan i di .\n\nTaking i near iHS1 and a near R+ h1, we have the following relation between\nfinite increments ?iHS (in degrees) and ?h or ?a (in kilometers):\n\n?iHS = 4.17\u00d7 10?3?h . (7.109)\n\nCalculating the Orbit with Expansion up to Jn\n\nUp to now, we have obtained results using (7.102), the basic relation for\nSun-synchronicity, with the value of ?? limited to the J2 term. This therefore\ncorresponds to the relation\n\n26Here we use HS as subscript for Sun-synchronous. It refers to the occasionally heard\n\u201cheliosynchronous\u201d, a word made up only of Greek roots, hence more satisfying from a\nlinguistic standpoint.\n\n\n\n7.5 Sun-Synchronicity 295\n\n?? = ??S , with\n??\n\nn\n= J2A2 cos i and A2 =\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)2(\n?3\n2\n\n)\n. (7.110)\n\nWhen we use an expansion up to degree l for ??, where l is even and we set\nl = 2m, this becomes\n\n?? = ??S , with\n??\n\nn\n=\n\n?\n?J2A2 + J22B2(i) +\n\nm?\nj=2\n\nJ2jA2j(i)\n\n?\n? cos i , (7.111)\n\nwhere\n\nA2j(i) =\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)2j j?1?\nk=0\n\nq\n(j)\n2k sin\n\n2k i , B2(i) =\n\n(\nR\n\np\n\n)4\n(q?0 + q\n\n?\n2 sin\n\n2 i) ,\n\nand the coefficients q\n(j)\n2k and q\n\n?\n2k involve numerical terms and the value of the\n\neccentricity e.\nIf we solve (7.111) for the inclination iHS, we obtain an equation of degree\n\nl? 1 in cos i. This equation is in fact easy to solve because the terms J22 and\nJl do not exceed 10\n\n?3J2. We begin by calculating i in the case when only\nJ2 is considered, using (7.102) or (7.110). Inserting this value in (7.111), and\nafter several iterations, we obtain the required value. The correction is very\nsmall. For h = 800km, we have iHS(J4) = 98.628\n\n? and iHS(J2) = 98.603?, i.e.,\na difference of 0.025?.\n\nNote. The value of the Sun-synchronous inclination iHS is indicated in all\nfigures in this book showing the ground tracks of Sun-synchronous satellites.\nObtained using the expansion to order J4, they differ by a few hundredths of\na degree from the value obtained directly by (7.105).\n\nExample 7.9 Calculate the inclination of the Landsat satellites.\n\n? The US programme Landsat was the first civilian programme for ob-\nservation of Earth resources (NASA). These satellites are in circular Sun-\nsynchronous orbit. The first three (Landsat-1 to -3) were at an altitude of\n908km, but for the following, Landsat-4 to -8, the altitude was lowered to\n700km:\n\n\u2022 Landsat-3: a = 7,285.799km, ? = a/R = 1.142308,\n\ncos i = ??7/2/kh = ?1.593095/10.10949 = ?0.15758 ,\n\ni = arccos(?0.15758) = 99.07? .\n\nExpanding the geopotential to order 4, we obtain i = 99.09?.\n\n\n\n296 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\n\u2022 Landsat-8: a = 7,077.738km, ? = a/R = 1.109687,\ncos i = ??7/2/kh = ?1.439469/10.10949 = ?0.14245 ,\n\ni = arccos(?0.14245) = 98.19? .\nExpanding the geopotential to order 4, we obtain i = 98.21?.\n\nA difference of altitude ?h = 908 ? 700 = 208km leads to a change in the\nangle equal to ?iHS = 99.09? 98.21 = 0.88?. This value can also be obtained\nusing (7.109):\n\n?iHS = 4.17\u00d7 10?3 \u00d7 208 = 0.88? . ?\n\n7.5.4 Calculating the Orbit: Elliptical Case\n\nSun-Synchronous Inclination\n\nTo examine the case of an orbit with eccentricity e, we use (6.73) or (7.15)\nto order 2. This yields\n\n? =\n\n[\n? kh\n(1? e2)2 cos i\n\n]2/7\n. (7.112)\n\nIn general, a and e are chosen and we obtain the inclination i from\n\ni = arccos\n\n[\n??\n\n7/2\n\nkh\n\n(\n1? e2\n\n)2]\n. (7.113)\n\nIt is important to note that not all values of e are possible.\nConsider for instance a circular orbit of altitude h = 640km, or ? = 1.1.\n\nIf we increase the eccentricity e of this orbit, while keeping the same semi-\nmajor axis a, we obtain a maximal value ha = 1,280km for the altitude at\napogee, corresponding to hp = 0km for the altitude at perigee. It is easy to\nsee that one could not go below this value for hp! The eccentricity thus has\na maximal value e1, which depends on a (and the radius R of the planet). In\nthis example, e1 = 0.09.\n\nQuite generally, putting hp = 0, we have\n\na1(1 ? e1) = R ,\nor\n\n?1 =\n1\n\n1? e1\n, whence e1 = 1?\n\n1\n\n?1\n, (7.114)\n\nwhere a1 and ?1 = a1/R are the values corresponding to e1.\nFigure 7.15 shows the relation between ? and i for several values of e within\n\nthe range of possible values. Since ?? varies for Sun-synchronous satellites in\nthe same direction as e, the angle i decreases when e increases, for a given\nvalue of a.\n\n\n\n7.5 Sun-Synchronicity 297\n\n90\n100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170\n\ne\n\n0.60\n\n0.55\n\n0.50\n\n0.45\n\n0.40\n0.35\n0.30\n0.25\n\n0.00\n\n180\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n1.9\n\n2.0\n\n2.1\n\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n2.4\n\n2.5\n\n2.6\n\nInclination (\u00b0)\n\na/R\n\nFig. 7.15 :Reduced distance ? = a/R as a function of the inclination i for Sun-\n\nsynchronous satellites with elliptical orbit for various values of the eccentricity e. The\n\nwhole range of possible values is shown. The specific values im and ic are indicated\n\n(see text).\n\nBounds on i, a, and e for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nThe inclination i varies between iHSmin = 95.7\n?, obtained from (7.106),\n\nto 180?. For a given inclination, ? varies between ?0, given by (7.112) with\ne = 0, and ?1, given by this same equation when e takes the value e1. Since\ne1 and ?1 are related by (7.114), we obtain\n\n? 1\nkh\n\n?3/2\n(\n2? 1\n\n?\n\n)2\n= cos i , (7.115)\n\nand ?1 is the solution of this equation, provided that the term on the left is\nless than or equal to 1.\n\nFor i = 180?, ? varies between ?0 = 1.9367 for e = 0 to ?1 = 2.4988 for\ne1 = 0.5998 (see Fig. 7.15, where the latter value has been taken as 0.60).\n\nSun-Synchronous Satellites in Highly Eccentric Orbit\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, Sun-synchronous orbits are near-circular,\nsince they are used for Earth observation missions which require the altitude\nto remain as close to constant as possible. However, there are some planned\nelliptical orbits in the field of communications.\n\n\n\n298 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nFor a highly eccentric orbit, the Sun-synchronicity condition also depends\non a further constraint. Indeed, to ensure that the perigee does not drift on the\norbit, the inclination must be chosen at its critical value, as given by (6.79).\nIt is essential that this value be greater than 90?, or i = 116.6?. The orbit of\nEllipso Borealis exemplifies this.\n\nExample 7.10 Notes on the orbit of satellites in the Ellipso Borealis constel-\nlation.\n\n? The satellite Ellipso Borealis has inclination i = 116.6? in order to cancel\napsidal precession. As the inclination is fixed, we thus select a and e as a ap-\npropriate for a Sun-synchronous orbit. The critical inclination iC is indicated\nin Fig. 7.15. If we solve (7.112) for ?0 and (7.115) for ?1, we obtain\n\n?0 = 1.5389 for e = 0 ,\n\n?1 = 1.7169 for e = e1 = 1? 1/?1 = 0.4174 .\n\nThe semi-major axis thus lies between a0 = 9,815.4km and a1 = 10,951.1km.\nFor other reasons relating to the period and also the question of recurrence,\nthe semi-major axis is taken equal to a = 10,559.2km, which corresponds to\nan eccentricity of e = 0.3463 (see Table 11.7). The altitudes at the perigee and\napogee are hp = 524 km and ha = 7,838km, respectively. This configuration\nof critical inclination, Sun-synchronicity, and recurrence is rather novel and\nparticularly interesting from the point of view of orbitography. ?\n\n7.5.5 Sun-Synchronous Satellites\n\nSun-synchronicity makes judicious use of the nodal precession of the satel-\nlite orbit. It is a fundamental advantage in space-based observation to be able\nto guarantee the passage of a satellite at constant local time for a given lat-\nitude, hence in lighting conditions such that the solar zenithal angle varies\nannually over a well defined (and rather narrow) range.\n\nHistorical Note on Sun-Synchronous Satellites\n\nThe first recorded Sun-synchronous satellite was SAMOS-2 (Satellite and\nMissile Observation System), a US military photographic reconnaissance satel-\nlite, launched on 31 January 1961, with hp = 474km, ha = 557 km, and\ni = 97.4?.\n\nThe first civilian arena to be interested in Sun-synchronous orbits was\nmeteorology. The satellite Nimbus-1 was launched on 28 August 1964. As\nthe launch was not entirely successful, it ended up on an eccentric, although\n\n\n\n7.5 Sun-Synchronicity 299\n\nnevertheless Sun-synchronous orbit, with hp = 429km, ha = 937km. It was\nfollowed by TIROS-9 and TIROS-10 (Television and Infra Red Observation\nSatellite), launched in 1965 into an eccentric orbit for the former and a near-\ncircular orbit with h ? 760 km, i = 98.8?, for the latter. All US meteorological\nsatellites were subsequently placed in Sun-synchronous orbits: Nimbus, ESSA,\nand NOAA on the civilian side, and DMSP for the military.\n\nIn contrast, the Soviet Union sent up dozens of meteorological satellites,\nat a rate of three or four per year, as part of the series Meteor-1, -2, and -3, for\nwhich they opted for a prograde non-Sun-synchronous near-polar orbit. Only\nthe last four of the Meteor-1 series were Sun-synchronous, launched between\n1977 and 1981, with h ? 600 km, i = 97.7?. However, these satellites in the\nMeteor-P series (Meteor-Priroda, where priroda means \u201cnature\u201d in Russian),\nadaptations of the meteorological satellites, were more generally destined for\nthe study of the environment and remote sensing.\n\nIndeed, remote-sensing applications have an even greater interest in Sun-\nsynchronous orbits than does meteorology. The first programme in this field\nwas American, with the Landsat programme, which began in 1972 and\nlaunched all its satellites into Sun-synchronous orbit. Corresponding pro-\ngrammes, such as the French SPOT, the European ERS, the Indian IRS,\nand the Russian Resurs-O, were all based on Sun-synchronous satellites, like\nthe environmental missions, e.g., EOS, Envisat, ADEOS, and the many pro-\ngrammes implemented since 2000, e.g., Ikonos, then GeoEye, QuickBird, then\nWorldView, to provide images with resolution of the order of a meter or half\na meter on a commercial basis.\n\nMilitary reconnaissance satellites are also to be found in the latter cat-\negory, and they are of course Sun-synchronous, like the French He?lios satel-\nlites, if they are intended to operate over long periods. At the beginning of\nthe space age, military reconnaissance missions were very short, from a few\ndays to about a week, for most Soviet satellites and some US satellites. In this\ncase, the idea of a Sun-synchronous orbit would be meaningless. Indeed, any\norbit is Sun-synchronous as long as nodal precession has not had sufficient\ntime to become noticeable. Furthermore, near-polar orbits are not necessarily\nconvenient for overflying \u201csensitive\u201d regions.\n\n7.5.6 Orbit Maintenance\n\nAs for any satellite, the orbit of a Sun-synchronous satellite will tend to\ndrift as time goes by, leading to slight modifications in the orbital elements.\nThe two main perturbative effects are the lunisolar attraction and atmospheric\ndrag. The first of these causes a slight variation in the satellite inclination,\nwhile the second causes braking and hence a reduction in altitude, as seen in\nExample 6.3.\n\nIn the case of Sun-synchronous satellites, it is of particular importance to\nachieve a constant crossing time at the ascending node (in local time or LMT).\nIf, like the SPOT, Landsat, ERS, and ADEOS satellites, the Sun-synchronous\n\n\n\n300 Chapter 7. Motion of Orbit, Earth and Sun\n\nsatellite is recurrent, in the sense that its ground track must repeat exactly\nthe same locus after a certain number of revolutions (see Chap. 11), it is even\nmore important to maintain the orbit.\n\nConsider the example of the SPOT satellites, for which the passage at the\ndescending node is fixed at ?DN = 10:30 \u00b1 0:10. To respect the recurrence\ncondition, which requires the ground track to pass within 3 km of the equa-\ntor, altitude corrections are necessary. These maneuvers take place every 2\u20138\nweeks depending on the level of solar activity. Every 18 months or so, the\ninclination is reset. Such frequent maneuvers mean that the crossing time at\nthe descending node is in fact ?DN = 10:30\u00b1 0:02 (the maximal discrepancy\nof 2min being well below the variation in the equation of time).\n\nCertain Sun-synchronous satellites are no longer maintained in orbit (by\nnecessity or by choice), and the local crossing time at the ascending node drifts\nin consequence (see Fig. 10.15). We shall return to this point in Chap. 10 when\nwe study the crossing times of Sun-synchronous satellites.\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nGround Track of a Satellite\n\n8.1 Position of Satellite on Its Orbit\n\nLet ?(O;x, y, z) be the Galilean reference frame already defined. The satel-\nlite S is in an elliptical orbit around the center of attraction O. The orbital\nplane P makes a constant angle i with the equatorial plane E . However, al-\nthough the plane P is considered as fixed relative to ? in the Keplerian motion,\nin a real (perturbed) motion, it will in fact rotate about the polar axis. This is\nprecessional motion,1 occurring with angular speed ??, as calculated in the last\ntwo chapters. A schematic representation of this motion is given in Fig. 8.1.\nWe shall describe the position of S in ? using the Euler angles.\n\n8.1.1 Using Euler Angles to Describe Satellite Motion\n\nThe three Euler angles2 ?1, ?2, and ?3, were introduced in Chap. 5 to\nspecify the orbit and its perigee in space (see in particular the appendix\nin Sect. 5.4). In the present case, we wish to specify S. We have already\nestablished the correspondence between the Euler angles and the orbital ele-\nments (see Fig. 5.1 and Table 5.1):\n\n1The word \u201cprecession\u201d, meaning \u201cthe action of preceding\u201d, was coined by Copernicus\naround 1530 (pr\u00e6cessio, nis in Latin) to speak about the precession of the equinoxes, i.e.,\nthe retrograde motion of the equinoctial points. This term was then taken up in mechanics\nto describe the corresponding Euler angle. In the motion of the satellite orbital plane, the\nword \u201cprecession\u201d clearly refers to a motion that may actually be prograde, as well as\nretrograde.\n\n2The three Euler angles are traditionally denoted by ?, ?, ?, or by ?, ?, ?, in those\norders. To avoid confusion with the latitudes denoted by ? and ? elsewhere in the book,\nwe have chosen to use the notation ?i, i = 1, 2, 3.\n\nM.

If the satellite has a\n\nprograde orbit (as here, where the ascending node has been indicated by a small black\n\ncircle, the descending node by a small white circle, and the latest ground track by a\n\ndash-dotted curve), the precessional motion is retrograde, i.e., ?? < 0.\n\n?1 = ? , (8.1)\n\n?2 = i , (8.2)\n\n?3 = ? + v .

(8.11)\n\nWe thus obtain the position of S(?, ?) as a function of time and the other\norbital parameters:\n\n? = arcsin\n[\nsin(? + v) sin i\n\n]\n, (8.12)\n\n? = ?0 + arccos\ncos? cos(? + v)? sin? sin(? + v) cos i\n\ncos?\n, (8.13)\n\n(? ? ?0) from the sign of\n[\nsin? cos(? + v) + cos? sin(? + v) cos i\n\n]\n,\n\n(8.14)\n\nwith\n\n?? ?0 ? (?? ,+?) .\n\nIf |?| = ?/2, then ? is not determined (and its determination would be point-\nless).\n\nThese equations (8.12)\u2013(8.14) can be written more concisely if the Carte-\nsian coordinates X , Y , and Z have already been calculated:\n\n? = arcsin\nZ\n\nr\n, (8.15)\n\n? = ?0 + arccos\nX\n\nr cos?\n, ?? ?0 from the sign of Y . (8.16)\n\n8.2 Ground Track of Satellite\n\n8.2.1 Equation for Ground Track\n\nIn most practical cases, one needs to know the position of the satellite\nrelative to the Earth. One must therefore represent S in the frame ?T, whose\n\n\n\n306 Chapter 8. Ground Track of a Satellite\n\naxes in the equatorial frame rotate with the Earth. The transformation from\nthis frame to the Galilean frame ? is obtained by a simple rotation about the\npolar axis Oz with angular speed ???T, since ?T rotates in ? with angular\nspeed ??T. Bear in mind that these calculations are carried out in the Galilean\nframe ?, but the results may be expressed in any frame that suits us.\n\nWith the above definition of ?0, the equations giving the position of S are\nthe same in ?T as in ?, provided that we replace the value of ?1 in (8.1) by\n\n?1 = ?0 + (?? ? ??T)(t? tAN) , (8.17)\n\nwhere the time origin, taken as the time of passage at the ascending node N ,\nis denoted by t = tAN.\n\nThe ground track T of the satellite is defined as the intersection of\nthe straight line segment OS with the Earth\u2019s surface, as we have seen in\nSect. 2.2.1, when discussing the geocentric ground track and the nadir. The\nposition of T is given in spherical coordinates: the longitude ? and the geo-\ncentric latitude ? are the same as for S in ?T, and the distance ?OT ? is R?,\ndefined by (1.38). The geodetic (or geographic) ground track is obtained by\ncalculating the geodetic latitude ?T from the geocentric latitude ? using (2.4).\n\nIn order to obtain the successive positions of the nadir, one must calculate\nthe geodetic latitude of the nadir ?, which requires knowing the altitude of\nthe satellite and using one of the methods discussed in Sect. 2.2.1. It is the\ngeodetic projection of the nadir that corresponds strictly to the subsatellite\npoint.\n\nFor a given position of the satellite, the values ?, ?T, and ? differ very\nslightly, as shown in Example 2.2. Depending on the accuracy required, charts\nof the ground track are set up using ?, the simplest solution, or using ?, to\nget a rigorously accurate result. Ground tracks generated by Ixion are geodetic\nground tracks of the nadir.\n\n8.2.2 Maximum Attained Latitude\n\nThe intersection of the orbital plane P , passing through the center of the\nEarth, and the equatorial plane E , considered as a plane of symmetry of the\nplanet, defines a maximal geocentric latitude ?m symmetrically in both the\nnorthern and the southern hemisphere. The range over which the ground track\ncan vary is\n\n? ? [??m; +?m] .\n\nThis angle ?m is equal to the inclination i, the dihedral angle between P and\nE , when i is acute, and its supplement if i is obtuse. We thus have the relations\n\n{\n0? ? i ? 90? (prograde) =? ?m = i ,\n90? ? i ? 180? (retrograde) =? ?m = 180? ? i .\n\n(8.18)\n\n\n\n8.3 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 307\n\nExpressing Z with the help of (8.10) and (8.11), we find that, when sin(?+v)\nreaches an extremum, we have sin?m = \u00b1 sin i. Using ?m, we can calculate\nthe maximal geodesic latitude ?m of the nadir, observing that ?m is always\nslightly greater than ?m.\n\nExample 8.1 Calculate the maximal latitudes attained by Jason-2 and ICE-\nSat.\n\n? The ocean topography satellite Jason-2 has a near-circular orbit at altitude\nh = 1, 336km, with inclination i = 66.040?. The maximal geocentric latitude\nof the ground track is thus\n\n?m = i = 66.040\n? .\n\nThis latitude corresponds to the geodetic latitude 66.183?. To calculate the\nlatitude of the nadir, we use (2.36) to order 1 in f :\n\n?? = ?? ? = f\n?\nsin 2? ,\n\nwhence, with f = 1/298.3 and ? = 1 + h/Re = 1.2095,\n\n?? = (298.3\u00d7 1.2095)?1 sin(2?m) = 2.0571 mrad = 0.118? ,\n\nand\n\n?m = 66.158\n? .\n\nThe iterative calculation using the algorithm in Table 2.4 gives the same result.\nThis difference ?? between the two latitudes corresponds to 13.1 km on the\nground.\n\nThe altimetry satellite ICESat is equipped with a laser that points to the\nnadir. It is in near-circular orbit at altitude h = 592km, and with inclination\ni = 94.003?. The maximal geocentric latitude of the ground track is thus\n\n?m = 180\n? ? i = 85.997? .\n\nThis latitude corresponds to the geodetic latitude 86.024?. Proceeding as be-\nfore, with ? = 1.0928, we obtain ?m = 86.021\n\n?, or a difference of ?? = 0.024?,\ncorresponding to 2.7 km on the ground. See also Example 2.2. ?\n\n8.3 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit\n\nCircular or near-circular orbits are very common. We now discuss some\nnotions developed specifically for these orbits, such as the equatorial shift or\nthe apparent inclination.\n\n\n\n308 Chapter 8. Ground Track of a Satellite\n\n8.3.1 Equation for Satellite Ground Track\n\nWhen the orbit is circular, the motion is uniform with angular frequency\nn, the mean motion. Using the notation introduced above, the value of ?3\nin (8.3) can be replaced by\n\n?3 = n(t? tAN) . (8.19)\n\nWe thus obtain the equation for the ground track as a function the time t.\n\nSun-Synchronous Satellites\n\nFor Sun-synchronous satellites, the angle ?1 takes a specific value since we\nhave ?? = ??S. We have seen that the two angular frequencies characterising the\nEarth\u2019s (annual and daily) motion are related by (7.33). According to (8.17),\nwe thus have\n\nd?1\ndt\n\n= ??1 = ??S ? ??T = ?\n2?\n\nDM\n. (8.20)\n\nUsing the daily orbital frequency as given by (7.35), we obtain, for Sun-\nsynchronous satellites, the very simple relation\n\n??1 = ?\nn\n\n?\n. (8.21)\n\nWe shall see the very important consequences of this relation in the following\nchapters, in particular when studying the crossing time of the satellite and\nthe question of recurrent orbits.\n\n8.3.2 Equatorial Shift\n\nThe difference in longitude between two consecutive ascending nodes ?1\nand ?2, separated by one revolution, is called the equatorial shift, denoted by\n??E :\n\n??E = ?2 ? ?1 . (8.22)\n\nRough Calculation\n\nIt is sometimes sufficient to carry out a quick calculation of the equatorial\nshift, which is then denoted by ?0?E. Indeed, to a first approximation we may\nsay that, during one revolution of period T (and we may take the Keplerian\nperiod here), the orbit of the satellite will not have moved relative to ?, while\nthe Earth makes one complete turn every day, i.e., it rotates through 15? per\nhour, or 1? every 4min relative to this same frame. In this context, we do\nnot bother with the precession of the orbit, or the Earth\u2019s motion relative to\nthe Sun over the time taken for the satellite to complete one revolution. This\namounts to using the approximate relations ??1 ? ???T and ??T ? 2?/DM.\n\n\n\n8.3 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 309\n\nWe have the simplified relation\n\n?0?E [deg] = ?\nT [min]\n\n4\n, (8.23)\n\nwhere the minus sign indicates a shift westwards.\n\nExact Calculation\n\nDuring one revolution lasting T = Td, the orbital plane will have rotated\nthrough an angle ?1 with respect to ?T. The exact value of the equatorial\nshift, as given by (8.17) with t? tAN = T , is therefore\n\n??E = ??1T = ?(??T ? ??)T = ?\n2?\n\n?\n. (8.24)\n\nWe note the following points, which follow from (8.24):\n\n\u2022 The equatorial shift is always negative, since ??T is greater than ??. The\nshift is westward for a satellite below the geosynchronous orbit.\n\n\u2022 For satellites in Sun-synchronous orbit, we obtained the specific value of\n??1, according to (8.20). Over one nodal period T , we have\n\n??E = ??1T = ?\n2?\n\nDM\nT = ?2?\n\n?\n. (8.25)\n\nWriting the angles in degrees and the time in minutes, we obtain (8.23).\nFor a Sun-synchronous satellite, the approximate formula is identical to the\nexact one. This is because the two approximations we made in the rough\ncalculation (neglecting precession and the annual motion of the Earth)\nexactly balance for this type of satellite.\n\n\u2022 For satellites in geosynchronous orbit, T = 2?/??T and ?? is negligible. (In\nany case, it is not the leading term in the perturbation treatment for this\ntype of satellite.) We thus have\n\n??E = ???TT = ?2? = 0 [mod 2?] , (8.26)\n\nwhere the notation [mod 2?] indicates that we calculate modulo 2?. There\nis no equatorial shift for such a satellite. The projection of two consecutive\nascending nodes does not move on the Earth. (If the satellite is geostation-\nary, it is difficult even to speak of an ascending node.)\n\nWe use DE to denote the equatorial shift expressed in units of length (usually\nkm), whence\n\nDE = R??E = ?\n2?R\n\n?\n, (8.27)\n\nwhere R is the equatorial radius of the planet. The sign corresponds to the\nwest-to-east convention for longitudes.\n\n\n\n310 Chapter 8. Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nExample 8.2 Calculate the equatorial shift for the satellite Meteor-3-07.\n\n? The characteristics of the orbit of this satellite are given in Example 7.3.\nFor the quick calculation, we use (8.23) with T = 109.4min. Then,\n\n?0?E = ?109.4/4 = ?27.35? , DE = ?3, 045 km .\n\nFor the exact calculation, with the values already given, viz.,\n\n??T = 729.212\u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 ,\n?? = ?1.429\u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 ,\n\n??T ? ?? = 730.641\u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 ,\n\nand T = 6, 565.28 s, we obtain\n\n??E = ?0.4797 rad = ?27.48? , DE = ?3, 059.51 km .\n\nThe equatorial shift of the satellite Meteor-3-07 is thus 3,059.5 km westward\n(see Fig. 8.3). ?\n\n8.3.3 Apparent Inclination\n\nDefinition and Calculation of Apparent Inclination\n\nThe apparent inclination is the angle between the ground track and the\nequator. This angle i? differs from the angle i representing the inclination,\nwhich is the inclination of the orbital plane of the satellite with respect to\nthe equatorial plane. This happens because i is measured in ?, whereas i? is\nmeasured in ?T.\n\nTo calculate i?, we consider in ?T the tangent plane to the Earth at N0,\nthe point on the Earth\u2019s surface corresponding to the ascending node, using\nthe orthogonal unit vectors e?, tangent to the equator, and e?, tangent to\nthe meridian through N0. In the Galilean frame ?, let V a be the absolute\nvelocity (given by the angular velocity) of the satellite at the instant when it\ncrosses the equator and let V f be the frame velocity of the point N0. For V a,\none must take into account the rate of nodal precession of the orbital plane,\nwhile V f is simply the rotational velocity of the Earth:\n\nV a =\n\n(\nn cos i + ??\n\nn sin i\n\n)\n, V f =\n\n(\n??T\n0\n\n)\n.\n\nBy the usual rule for composing velocities, we obtain the relative velocity V r\nof the satellite in the terrestrial frame ?T as\n\nV r = V a ? V f =\n(\nn cos i+ ?? ? ??T\n\nn sin i\n\n)\n.\n\n\n\n8.3 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 311\n\nMeteor-3-0Meteor-3-07\nOrbit - ref.: Earth\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:   109.4 min =   0.08 day\n\nAltitude = 1194.6 km a = 7572.702 km\n\nInclination  =  82.56 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   109.42 min    * rev/day =13.16\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 3059.5 km  (  27.5 \u00b0)\n\nAsc.

The\n\ndistance between the two successive ascending nodes is the equatorial shift.\n\n\n\n312 Chapter 8. Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nThe apparent inclination is then given by\n\ntan i? =\nn sin i\n\nn cos i? (??T ? ??)\n. (8.28)\n\nIn terms of the daily recurrence frequency ? defined by (7.43), we may write\n\ntan i? =\nsin i\n\ncos i? 1/? . (8.29)\n\nExpanding tan(i? ? i), we obtain\n\n?i = i? ? i = arctan sin i\n?? cos i . (8.30)\n\nNote that we always have i? ? i.\nFor a Sun-synchronous satellite, we may replace ? by ?, since according\n\nto (7.44), these two daily frequencies are equal.\nFor a satellite in a non-circular elliptical orbit, this calculation is of course\n\npossible, but n must be replaced by the instantaneous angular velocity of\nthe satellite at N0. Since this depends on the position of the perigee and the\neccentricity, there is no simple general expression for i?.\n\nExample 8.3 Calculate the apparent inclination for the LEO satellite Terra\nand for an MEO Navstar satellite in the GPS constellation.\n\n? The satellite Terra has a near-circular Sun-synchronous orbit with inclina-\ntion i = 98.21? and nodal period Td = 98.884min. We calculate 1/? from Td,\nwith the result\n\n1/? = Td/1440 = 0.06867 .\n\nWe can then apply (8.29) directly since, in the Sun-synchronous case, ? = ?,\nso\n\ntan i? =\nsin 98.21\n\ncos 98.21? 0.06867 = ?\n0.98975\n\n0.21147\n= ?4.68030 ,\n\nand hence,\n\ni? = 102.06? , i? ? i = 3.85? .\n\nThis inclination i? can be measured on images taken by Terra, as can be seen\nin Figs. 9.25 and 9.26.\n\n\n\n8.3 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 313\n\nThe characteristics of Navstar/GPS are a = 26, 560km and i = 55.00?.\nThe period is Td = 717.978 (half a sidereal day). We find ? by calculating the\nnodal precession rate:\n\n?? = ?0.03878 deg/day , ? = 2.0056 , ? = 2.0000 ,\n\ntan i? =\nsin 55.00\n\ncos 55.00? 0.5000 = ?\n0.81915\n\n0.07358\n= 11.13335 ,\n\nand hence,\n\ni? = 84.87? , i? ? i = 29.87? .\n\nAt the equator, the ground track of the satellite is very close to the meridian\nof the ascending node (in fact, within 5?), see Fig 14.6. ?\n\nExample 8.4 Calculate the apparent inclination for the ground track of a\ngeosynchronous satellite in circular orbit.\n\n? For a geosynchronous satellite, we have ??T/n = 1 and the term ?? is neg-\nligible. Equation (8.28) becomes\n\ntan i? =\nsin i\n\ncos i? 1 = ?\ncos(i/2)\n\nsin(i/2)\n= tan\n\n(\n?\n\n2\n+\n\ni\n\n2\n\n)\n,\n\nwhence\n\ni? = 90? +\ni\n\n2\n, i? ? i = 90? ? i\n\n2\n.\n\nWhen i is very small, e.g., i = 1?, we have i? = 90.5?: the ground track is not a\npoint but a small line segment almost perpendicular to the equator, between\nlatitudes 1?N and 1?S, which transforms into a figure of 8 (see Example 8.5)\nwhen i increases, growing larger with i.\n\nThe first operational geosynchronous satellite, Syncom-2, had inclination\n32.8?. Its ground track made an angle of 106.4? with the equator, or an angle\nof 16.4? with the nodal meridian, as can be seen from the upper part of\nFig. 9.16. ?\n\nExample 8.5 Calculate the coordinates of the ground track of a geosyn-\nchronous satellite in circular orbit.\n\n? For such a satellite, the ground track can be relatively simple expressed.\nThe orbital characteristics are\n\nr = a = aGS , e = 0 , v = M = nt , n = ??T , ?? ? 0 .\n\n\n\n314 Chapter 8. Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nFurthermore, we choose ?0 = 0 and ? = 0. The Euler angles thus have the\nvalues\n\n?1 = ??Tt = ?nt , ?2 = i , ?3 = ? + v = M = nt .\n\nWith (8.8) and (8.10) and setting C = cos i, we obtain the coordinates of the\nground track:\n\n?\n?XY\n\nZ\n\n?\n? = R\n\n?\n? (1? C) cos\n\n2 nt+ C\n?(1? C) sinnt cosnt?\n\n1? C2 sinnt\n\n?\n? . (8.31)\n\nWe obtain the geocentric coordinates, i.e., the longitude ? and the latitude\n?, using (8.15) and (8.16). Figure 8.4 (upper) shows the ground tracks for\nvarious values of the inclination.\n\nNote. It is often claimed in the literature that the figure of 8 trajectory of\ninclined geostationary satellites is a Bernoulli lemniscate. Let us ignore the fact\nthat the lemniscate is a plane curve, unlike the trajectory or its ground track.\nWe can write down the projection of the trajectory on a plane perpendicular\nto the Earth radius passing through the ascending node with longitude ?0.\nFor the Cartesian coordinates of the ground track, we use x1 for the (abscissa)\ncoordinate in the equatorial plane and y1 for the (ordinate) coordinate along\nthe polar axis. Setting ? = nt and R = 1 and using (8.31), we see that x1\ncorresponds to Y and y1 to Z. We then obtain\n\n{\nx1 = ?(1? C) sin ? cos ? ,\ny1 =\n\n?\n1? C2 sin ? . (8.32)\n\nAfter normalisation, the parametric equation for the lemniscate is\n\n???\n??\n\nx2 = ?(1? C)\nsin ? cos ?\n\n1 + cos2 ?\n,\n\ny2 =\n?\n1? C2 sin ?\n\n1 + cos2 ?\n.\n\n(8.33)\n\nEquations (8.32) and (8.33) are different, but in both cases, the derivatives at\nthe origin (which give the apparent inclination) are in fact the same:\n\ntan i? =\ndy\n\ndx\n\n????\n0\n\n= ?cos(i/2)\nsin(i/2)\n\n= tan\n\n(\n?\n\n2\n+\n\ni\n\n2\n\n)\n=? i? ? i = 90? ? i\n\n2\n.\n\nAs can be seen quite clearly in Fig. 8.4 (lower), the projection of the ground\ntrack is not a lemniscate. The two curves differ, but the tangents at the origin\nare the same. ?\n\n\n\n8.3 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 315\n\n-90 -80 -70 -60 -50 -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n\n-80\n\n-70\n\n-60\n\n-50\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n90\n\nLongitude\n\nLa\ntit\n\nud\ne\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n90\n\n10\n\n-15 -10 -5 0 5 10 15\n\n-50\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nInclination   45\n\nEquator\n\nLemniscate\n\nCartesian C.\n\nLongit., Latit.\n\nFig. 8.4 :Ground track of a geosynchronous satellite in circular orbit.

Ground Track of a Satellite\n\n8.3.4 Angle Between Ground Track and a Meridian\n\nWe calculate the angle between the satellite ground track and a merid-\nian for an arbitrary point on the ground track. The calculation of the angle\nbetween the ground track and a line of latitude gives a generalisation of the\napparent inclination. However, in practice, it is more useful to know the angle\nbetween the ground track and the north\u2013south direction.\n\nIn the frame ?, the satellite orbit cuts the meridian at an angle j. Referring\nto Fig. 10.15, P is the subsatellite point (with latitude ?), N is the point on\nthe ground track corresponding to the ascending node (the dihedral angle at\nN gives the inclination i), and PQ is the meridian through P , where Q is on\nthe equator. The dihedral angle at P , in the spherical triangle PQN , is the\nangle j that we wish to determine. Using the relation (ST V), we obtain\n\nsin j =\ncos i\n\ncos?\n. (8.34)\n\nTo calculate j?, we consider in ?T the plane tangent to the sphere of radius R\nat the relevant point, with latitude ?, and orthogonal unit vectors e? and e?\nas already defined. As in the calculation of the apparent inclination, we write\n\nV a =\n\n(\nn sin j + ?? cos?\n\nn cos j\n\n)\n, V f =\n\n(\n??T cos?\n0\n\n)\n,\n\nV r = V a ? V f =\n(\nn sin j ? (??T ? ??) cos?\n\nn cos j\n\n)\n.\n\nIt follows that\n\ntan j? =\nsin j ? (1/?) cos?\n\ncos j\n, (8.35)\n\nand expressing j with the help of (8.34),\n\ntan j? =\ncos i? (1/?) cos2 ??\n\ncos2 ? ? cos2 i\n. (8.36)\n\nWe obtain the adjustment angle ?j as a function of i and ?, viz.,\n\n?j = j? ? j = arctan\n?\ncos2 ? ? cos2 i\n?? cos i . (8.37)\n\nThis can be compared with (8.30) by setting ? = 0. The adjustment angle ?j\nis maximal at the equator. When the maximal geocentric latitude is reached,\nit can be checked that the ground track is normal to the meridian. For a\nSun-synchronous satellite, ? can be replaced by ?.\n\nExample 12.7 gives a direct application and a concrete illustration of the\ncalculation of ?j using (8.37).\n\n\n\n8.3 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 317\n\n8.3.5 Velocity of a Satellite and Its Ground Track\n\nThe satellite velocity can be calculated very accurately with the equations\nof motion discussed earlier. Here we calculate the velocity of the satellite and\nits ground track to a good level of accuracy, treating circular Keplerian motion.\nThis section could therefore have appeared in Chap. 5, but we preferred to\ndiscuss these issues here, after dealing with the Earth\u2019s rotation, defining\nthe notion of ground track, and describing the various kinds of satellites,\nespecially, geosynchronous satellites.\n\nDefinitions of the Different Velocities\n\nThe velocities of the satellite S and its ground track S0 in ? can be simply\nexpressed in terms of the mean motion n :\n\nV =\ndOS\n\ndt\n, V = an =\n\n?\n?\n\na\n, (8.38)\n\nV 0 =\ndOS0\ndt\n\n, V0 = Rn =\nR\n\na\nV =\n\nR\n\na\n\n?\n?\n\na\n. (8.39)\n\nIn the terrestrial frame ?T, we consider a point on the Earth\u2019s surface, e.g.,\nS0, and the right-handed triad of unit vectors associated with spherical coor-\ndinates, viz., (er, e?, e?). In the plane (e?, e?) tangent to the Earth (the local\nhorizontal plane), the vector e? lies along a line of latitude and the vector e?\nalong a meridian. In this frame, the velocity w of the ground track is\n\nw = V 0 ?R??T cos? e? .\n\nIf eu is the unit vector along V 0, we obtain an expression for w, which can be\ncalled the relative velocity of the ground track or the velocity of the ground\ntrack relative to the ground:\n\nw = R\n(\nn eu ? ??T cos? e?\n\n)\n. (8.40)\n\nVelocity at the Equator\n\nIn order to compare the values obtained for different satellites, we consider\nthe relative velocity w at the ascending (or descending) node, i.e., at the\nequator, where we shall denote it by wE :\n\nwE\nR\n\n= neu ? ??Te? .\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the inclination i of the satellite:\n\nwE\nR\n\n=\n(\nn cos i? ??T\n\n)\ne? + n sin i e? . (8.41)\n\n\n\n318 Chapter 8. Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nIf wE is the magnitude of wE taken in the direction of motion, we obtain the\nfollowing results for the three values i = 0?, 90?, and 180? of the inclination:\n\nwE\nR\n\n=\n\n???\n??\n\nn? ??T , i = 0? ,?\nn2 + ??2T , i = 90\n\n? ,\nn+ ??T , i = 180\n\n? .\n\n(8.42)\n\nTable 8.1 shows, for various satellites, the velocities V and V0 of the satellite\nand its ground track in ?, and the relative velocity wE of the ground track\nin ?T for these three values of i. These results are shown for all altitudes\nbetween 0 and 1,600km, in steps of 100 km, then for several altitudes typical\nof certain kinds of mission.\n\nThe maximal velocity of the ground track relative to the ground is\n8.4 km s?1, obtained for a retrograde satellite at ground level. More realis-\ntically, the velocity of the ground track at the equator for an operational\nSun-synchronous satellite is 6.6 km s?1. For a geosynchronous satellite with\ni = 0, hence geostationary, we find wE = wE(i = 0) = 0.00.\n\nRegarding the last satellite in Table 8.1, it is not an artificial satellite, but\na simplified model of the Moon (circular Keplerian orbit), at a distance of\n380,000km, and with a period of about 27 days. Note that, in ?, the sidereal\nperiod is 27.32 days. In ?T, the period that takes into account the motion\nof the Earth is 29.53 days, or one lunar month.3 This period, known as the\nsynodic period, is explained below.\n\nSynodic Period\n\nThe idea of synodic period4 is often used to speak about both satellites and\nplanets. Consider two bodies in the same Galilean frame, moving uniformly\nwith angular speeds (mean motions) n and n1. The motion of the first relative\nto the second is a (relative) motion of angular speed n? given by\n\nn? = n? n1 . (8.43)\n\nIn terms of periods, this means that\n\n1\n\nT ?\n=\n\n1\n\nT\n? 1\n\nT1\n, (8.44)\n\n3It is no accident that the word \u201cmonth\u201d is so similar to \u201cMoon\u201d, and the same is true of\nthese words in German and related languages. The Indo-European root ?men, ?mes refers\nto the Moon, lunation (lunar month), and measurement or mensuration (of time). Many\nlanguages in this family still use similar terms, but this is not the case in Greek or Latin.\nThese two languages called the Moon \u201cthe bright one\u201d (? /?\n?? ?  \t ; luna, \u00e6), which gives\nthe present French name \u201cLune\u201d. See also the note on Chandrasekhar.\n\n4The noun ? /0??#?\t? ??, \u201csynod\u201d, is made up of /0?, meaning \u201cwith\u201d or \u201ctogether\u201d,\nand ? ?#)\t? ??, meaning \u201cpath\u201d or \u201cjourney\u201d. In Ancient Greek, it already had the double\nmeaning of \u201cmeeting\u201d and \u201cconjunction of heavenly bodies\u201d, both of which illustrate the\nidea of \u201cthings happening at the same time\u201d.\n\n\n\n8.3 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 319\n\nh a ?

T ? = 29.53 d .\n\nFor a geostationary satellite, for which T = T1 = 1 Dsid (sidereal day), the\nsynodic period is considered to be infinite. For a GPS satellite, T = 0.5 Dsid\nand T1 = 1 Dsid, whence T\n\n? = 1 Dsid, which shows that the satellite only\ncrosses a given meridian once a day.\n\n8.3.6 Eliminating Time from the Ground Track Equation\n\nFor a circular orbit, we can express the longitude ? as a function of the\ngeocentric latitude ?, with the help of the inclination i and the frequency ?,\nbut without bringing in the time t (elimination of time). At the time tAN, the\ngeocentric ground track of the satellite crosses the equator at A, the point\non the surface corresponding to the ascending node, taken as origin. At time\nt, the ground track is at S. In the Galilean frame ? (defined by the Earth\u2019s\nequatorial plane and the polar axis Oz, keeping the axis OA fixed), the length\nof the arc AS (arc of a great circle) represents the position on orbit ? :\n\n? =\n\n\n\nAS= nd(t? tAN) , (8.45)\n\nwhere nd is the mean motion relating to the nodal period Td.\nThe longitude ?G of the satellite in this same frame ? is given by the arc\n\nAS?, where S? is the intersection of the meridian PS with the equator (see\nFig. 8.5):\n\n?G =\n\n\n\nAS? .\n\nRelative to a terrestrial frame ?T, the longitude ?T is\n\n?T = ?G ? (??T ? ??)(t? tAN) .\n\nUsing the recurrence frequency ?, we obtain\n\n?T = ?G ?\nnd\n?\n(t? tAN) ,\n\nwhence we may eliminate the time using (8.45), to give\n\n?T = ?G ?\n?\n\n?\n.\n\n\n\n8.3 Ground Track of Satellite in Circular Orbit 321\n\nP\n\nS\n\nA\n\nO\n\nS?\n\nz\n\nFig. 8.5 :Ground track of the orbit in a Galilean frame. Investigation of the relation\n\nin spherical geometry between the latitude and longitude for a point S on the ground\n\ntrack. The ascending node is at A. In the spherical triangle ASS?, the arc AS?\n\nrepresents the longitude and the arc S?S the latitude. The angle A is the inclination\nand the angle S? is a right-angle. P is the pole.\n\nIn the spherical triangle ASS?, we know the following angles and sides (arcs):\n\nangleA = i , angleS? = ?/2 ,\n\na =\n\n\n\nSS?= ? , s =\n\n\n\nAS?= ?G , s? =\n\n\n\nAS= ? ,\n\n(ST X) =? sin?G =\ntan?\n\ntan i\n, (ST VIII) =? sin? = sin?\n\nsin i\n.\n\nWe thus obtain an expression for the longitude:\n\n?T = arcsin\ntan?\n\ntan i\n? 1\n\n?\narcsin\n\nsin?\n\nsin i\n. (8.46)\n\nTaking the Greenwich meridian as zero longitude rather than A, we have\n\n?T = ?? ?AN ,\n\nwhere ? and ?AN are the longitudes of S and A, respectively.\nFinally, we obtain the longitude ? of the satellite in circular orbit:\n\n? = ?AN + arcsin\ntan?\n\ntan i\n? 1\n\n?\narcsin\n\nsin?\n\nsin i\n.

The headquarters are at the Peterson airforce base in Colorado, USA.\nIt was founded in 1957, during the Cold War. The United States was concerned\nabout the possibility of missiles launched from the USSR, which would have\narrived from the north.\n\nNORAD operates dozens of radars, with which it can detect any object\nmeasuring more than a meter across in space, and 10 cm up to an altitude\nof 8,000km. All satellites are detected and identified by these radars. Their\nmotion is calculated using propagation models (orbitography software), then\nadjusted by further radar measurements. The orbital elements are coded in\ntwo-line elements (TLE), discussed below. For \u201cunclassified\u201d satellites, these\nresults, be they radar measurements or calculations, are broadcast several\ntimes a day (one to three times).\n\nAmerican intelligence satellites, or more generally, any US satellite consid-\nered to have a \u201csensitive\u201d mission, are excluded from the broadcasts, but the\nFrench military satellites He?lios and Essaim were not. Hence, with the assis-\ntance of an orbitography software like Ixion, it was easy to determine which of\nthese satellites were maintained on the correct orbit and which were drifting.\nDissatisfied with this attitude, the French Defence Ministry set up the system\nknown as GRAVES (Grand re?seau adapte? a? la veille spatiale), which went\n\n\n\n8.4 Appendix: NORAD Orbital Elements 323\n\ninto operation in 2005, and which can detect any satellite overflying France.\nAlmost thirty NORAD \u201cclassified\u201d satellites were thereby brought to light.\n\nThanks to GRAVES, Paris was able to negotiate with Washington: \u201cWe\nagree to show discretion with regard to certain of your satellites, provided that\nyou stop broadcasting data concerning our more \u2018sensitive\u2019 satellites.\u201d The\nmove paid off in the end, since from 8 December 2009, just before the launch\nof He?lios-2B, the satellites He?lios and Essaim were taken off the NORAD TLE\nlisting.\n\n8.4.2 Two-Line Element (TLE) Set Format\n\nNORAD detects objects in orbit and provides their orbital elements in the\nform of two lines of 69 characters (numbers, letters, signs, and spaces). These\ndata comprise the NORAD two-line element set format, abbreviated to TLE\nand accessible by Internet. For each satellite, the data appear in the following\nform:\n\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n1 NNNNNU NNNNNAAA NNNNN.NNNNNNNN +.NNNNNNNN +NNNNN-N +NNNNN-N N NNNNN\n\n2 NNNNN NNN.NNNN NNN.NNNN NNNNNNN NNN.NNNN NNN.NNNN NN.NNNNNNNNNNNNNN\n\nLine 0 names the orbiting object (satellite, or rocket element) in 24 characters.\nThe standard TLE comprises lines 1 and 2, in a format used by NORAD and\nNASA. Line 1 gives the date and information concerning atmospheric drag.\nThe orbital elements are in line 2. The exact description of this format is\nshown in Table 8.2.\n\n8.4.3 Decoding the TLE\n\nThe correspondence between the six classic Keplerian elements discussed\nin Chap. 5 and the six NORAD elements is immediate for the metric elements\ni and e and the angle elements ?, ?, andM . The semi-major axis a is obtained\nfrom the mean motion n.\n\nIn order to use these orbital elements in a practical context, two of them\nrequire preliminary calculations:\n\n\u2022 As we have just seen, the semi-major axis a is not given directly by the\nNORAD elements. The number of revolutions per day gives the anomalistic\nperiod Ta (because the period, in this orbital study, is defined as the time\nelapsed between two successive transits at perigee). We obtain the value of\na by an iterative method like the one used in Example 7.3.\n\n\u2022 The angle ?, the right ascension of the ascending node, is measured in a\nGalilean frame from the direction of the vernal equinox. But in practice,\none needs to know ?0, the longitude of the ascending node of the orbit,\ni.e., the angular elongation of this point in a terrestrial frame, measured\nfrom the Greenwich meridian. With the usual notation, we can say that ?\nis measured in ?, and ?0 in ?T.\n\n\n\n324 Chapter 8.

Credit: NORAD.\n\nWe first calculate the angle ?G00 between the Greenwich meridian and the\nvernal equinox at 0 h UT on the relevant day. This angle corresponds to the\nmean sidereal time GMST (Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time) at 0 h, written\nqG00 and measured in seconds. It is obtained from the relation\n\n5\n\nqG00 = 24110.54841+ 8640184.812866Tu (8.49)\n\n+9.3104\u00d7 10?2T 2u ? 6.2\u00d7 10?6T 3u ,\n\n5The expression for qG00 contains four terms:\n\n\u2022 The first gives the position of the Greenwich meridian at the date taken as origin, viz.,\nJ2000.0.\n\n\u2022 In the second, the coefficient of Tu is equal to the number of seconds in one day (86,400)\nmultiplied by the number of days in one Julian century (36,525), divided by the number\nof days in the tropical year (Ntro = 365.2421897).\n\n\u2022 The third is related to nutation.\n\u2022 The fourth accounts for the precession of the equinoxes.\n\n\n\n8.4 Appendix: NORAD Orbital Elements 325\n\nwhere Tu, the time in Julian centuries, is defined by Tu = du/36525, with du\nthe number of days elapsed since 1 January 2000 at 12 h (chosen date origin,\ncalled J2000.0, corresponding to the Julian date JD 2451545.0).\n\nIf ?D is the fraction of the day elapsed since 0 h (given in line 1 of the\nTLE), we can calculate the sidereal time (GMST) at the relevant time t (UT):\n\nqGt = qG00 + 86400??T?D [mod 86400] , (8.50)\n\nwhere ??T is the angular speed of rotation of the Earth in rev/day, as given\nby (7.28). It is not really necessary to use (7.29). With the equivalence between\ndays and revolutions (1 day is 360?), we can obtain ?Gt in degrees from qG\nin seconds:\n\n?Gt =\nqGt\n240\n\n, (8.51)\n\nwhich is the angle between the Greenwich meridian and the vernal equinox at\nthe relevant UT time.\n\nThe positions of the ascending node and the Greenwich meridian, denoted\n? and ?Gt, respectively, are measured from the same origin at the same time.\nWe thus obtain the longitude ?0 of the ascending node in a terrestrial frame:\n\n?0 = ? ??Gt . (8.52)\n\nWith ? and v (obtained from M and e), we can calculate the crossing time of\nthe satellite at the ascending node and its position ?AN (taking into account\nthe precession of the orbit over this time interval). The longitude and the UT\ntime thus give the LMT crossing time at the ascending node.\n\nExample 8.6 Calculate the orbital elements of the ICESat satellite from the\nNORAD elements.\n\n? During the first few months of its mission, the satellite ICESat followed a\nso-called calibration orbit. Its ground track had to repeat every 8 days (we\nreturn to the question of recurrence in Chap. 11). The NORAD elements for\nthe given day during this calibration phase, were as follows:\n\nICESAT\n\n1 27642U 03002A 03175.25018279 .00000722 00000-0 75456-4 0 1631\n\n2 27642 94.0031 263.4514 0002250 85.5696 274.5785 14.90462832 24163\n\nWe obtain the date from\n\n03175.25018279: year = 03, day = 175, hour = 0.25018279 \u00d7 24.\n\n\n\n326 Chapter 8. Ground Track of a Satellite\n\ngiving 24 June 2003 at 06:00:15.79 UTC. Just for information, this was revo-\nlution number 2416, counting from the satellite\u2019s first passage at perigee. The\nfollowing elements are obtained immediately:\n\nn = 14.90462832 rev/day , e = 0.0002250 , i = 94.0031? ,\n\n? = 263.4514? , ? = 85.5696? , M = 274.5785? .\n\nWith the mean anomalyM , we can calculate the eccentric and true anomalies,\nvery close to M since the eccentricity is extremely small: E = 274.566? and\nv = 274.553?. With n, we find the anomalistic period\n\nTa [min] = 1440/n , whence Ta = 96.61428min .\n\nWe can calculate the position on orbit ? = ? + v :\n\n? = 85.569 + 274.553 = 360.122 = 0.122 [mod 360] .\n\nThe position of the satellite at the initial time is not therefore the ascending\nnode, but rather a point located slightly above the equator, in the northern\nhemisphere. We can calculate the difference between the initial time and the\nascending node crossing time, first in mean anomaly, then in time:\n\n?M = M ?M(v = ??) = 274.579? 274.457 = 0.122 ,\n\n?t =\n0.122\n\n360\n\u00d7 Ta = 1.971 s .\n\nTo begin with, we set T0 = Ta, and with this Keplerian period, we obtain\nthe value of the semi-major axis of the Keplerian orbit: a0 = 6, 974.6km. We\ncalculate the secular variation related to the mean motion, ?n/n = ?0.6695\u00d7\n10?3, then recalculate a. After several iterations, this yields a = 6, 971.515 km\nor an altitude of h = a ? R = 593 km. With the values of a and i, we can\ncalculate the precession rates and periods. This yields:\n\nnodal precession ?? = +0.5079?/day ,\napsidal precession ?? = ?3.5508?/day ,\nanomalistic period Ta = 96.61428min (check) ,\n\ndraconitic period Td = 96.67818min .\n\nTo calculate the longitude of the orbital plane at the initial time, we determine\nthe Julian date of the relevant time, namely JD 2452814.75018279, which gives\n\ndu = JD? J2000.0 = 1269.75018279 , Tu = du/36525 .\n\n\n\n8.4 Appendix: NORAD Orbital Elements 327\n\nUsing (8.49),\n\nqG00 = 65217.588 [mod 86400] ,\n\nand then with ?D = 0.25018279, we obtain\n\nqGt = qG00 + 86400\u00d7 1.00273790934\u00d7 0.25018279\n= qG00 + 21674.993 = 86892.581 = 492.581 [mod 86400] .\n\nIf qGt is in seconds, then ?Gt is in degrees:\n\n?Gt = 492.581/240 = 2.052 .\n\nWith (8.52), we thus have\n\n?0 = 263.451? 2.052 = 261.399 .\n\nWe can calculate the displacement ?? = ?0 ? ?AN of the orbital plane in the\nterrestrial plane, taking into account nodal precession during the time ?t.\nThe quantity ?? is very small here, viz., ?? = ?0.008. We thus obtain ?AN,\nthe longitude of the transit at the ascending node:\n\n?AN = ?0 ??? = 261.399 + 0.008 = 261.407 .\n\nFor a transit at the ascending node at longitude 261.407?, i.e., 98.593? W, the\ntime 06:00:14 UT corresponds to 23:25:52 LMT.\n\nThese elements suffice to represent the ground track of the ICESat satellite\nover 8 days. During this time, the satellite should pass through the vertical\nat the calibration site in White Sands (Arizona, USA). Figure 8.6 shows that\nthis constraint was respected. ?\n\n8.4.4 Conditions of Use\n\nIn order to exploit NORAD data in the form of the TLE, one must use\nan orbitography software to get from n to a. If we then insert the six orbital\nelements for the given day D into the program, we can obtain very accurate\nresults concerning the position of the satellite (to within 100m) over a period\nof 1 or 2 weeks before and after D.\n\nFor satellites that must be held on orbit over long periods (several months),\nand if up-to-date NORAD data is not available, it is better to use the nom-\ninal orbital elements rather than obsolete TLE data. Indeed, recurrent Sun-\nsynchronous satellites such as SPOT, or non-Sun-synchronous satellites like\nthose in the A-train, such as Jason, are repositioned on their reference orbit\nseveral times a month. NORAD TLE data is not well suited to very high\nprecision operations, such as orbital docking maneuvers.\n\n\n\n328 Chapter 8.

(longitude,\nlatitude), in a bijective manner onto its coordinates x, y on the map:\n\ncartographic projection f = {f1, f2}\n{\nx = f1(?, ?) ,\ny = f2(?, ?) .\n\nThere exist infinitely many such projections.\nThe main problem to be solved by a cartographic projection can be put\n\nsuccinctly as follows: the sphere is not developable. This means that the sur-\nface of a sphere cannot be mapped onto a plane without distorting or tearing\nit.6 Theoretical study of this question was carried out contemporaneously by\nLambert7 in 1772, Euler in 1777, and Lagrange in 1779. It was definitively\nsolved by Gauss in (1822), who studied the conditions under which an arbi-\ntrary surface could be mapped onto another arbitrary surface.\n\nA cartographic projection can have (exclusively) one or other of the fol-\nlowing two properties:\n\n\u2022 Angles are conserved, and the projection is said to be conformal.\n\u2022 Areas are conserved, and the projection is said to be equal-area.\n\nIt may be that it has neither of these properties,8 but it can never have both.\nIn fact, the map can conserve the angles or the area of a figure, but it can\nnever conserve the perimeter. No map can conserve distances in all directions.\nIn other words, no projection can have constant scale over the whole field of\nprojection.\n\nIn a conformal projection, the parallels and the meridians on the map\nintersect at right-angles, since the same is true on the sphere, where they form\ntwo sets of orthogonal curves. In an equal-area projection, a country twice as\n\n6Unlike the sphere, a cylinder is developable. If the body of a big cat could be assimilated\nto a cylinder, one could understand how the tiger might change into a bedside rug without\ndeformation.\n\n7Jean Henri Lambert (1728\u20131777) was a Swiss and German astronomer, mathematician,\nand physicist, with French ancestry. In astronomy, he calculated the trajectories of comets\nand understood that the Milky Way was just a modest galaxy in the Universe. In physics,\nhe discovered the fundamental law of photometry. In his many mathematical works, among\nwhich he demonstrated the irrationality of ? (1766), he attributed great importance to\nproblems of perspective and cartographic projections. He defined a great many projections,\nseveral of which bear his name today. The best known is the conformal conical projection,\nused in France for the map of France since 1922 and the cadastral survey since 1938.\n\n8The older literature is full of different adjectives describing these properties, e.g., auto-\ngonal and orthomorphic for conformal, and authalic, homolographic, equiareal, and equiv-\nalent for equal-area, while an aphylactic projection is one that is neither equal-area nor\nconformal. Such terms have now fallen into disuse.\n\n\n\n330 Chapter 8. Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nbig as another is represented on the map by an area twice as big. When the\nwhole Earth is represented, it can be considered as spherical since projecting\nthe terrestrial sphere or ellipsoid onto a plane leads to quite imperceptible\ndifferences in the resulting maps, whatever projection may be used. The same\nis not true for accurate regional maps, however.\n\n8.5.2 Classifying Projections by Type or Aspect\n\nProjections can be classified by type or by aspect. The type tells us how\nthe sphere appears when projected onto the map, i.e., cylindrical, conical,\nazimuthal, and so on. We use the word \u201cappears\u201d because a cartographic\nprojection is not usually (and the exceptions are very rare) a projection in\nthe sense of an intersection between a straight line and a plane. For example,\nthe Mercator projection is said to be cylindrical, but it is not the \u201cprojection\u201d\nof this sphere from its center onto a cylinder that is tangent to it at the equator\n(as one often reads).\n\nThe aspect of a projection can be direct (or normal), transverse, or oblique.\nFor example, for a stereographic projection (of azimuthal type) with direct\naspect (also called polar in this case), the point of contact of the plane of\nprojection with the sphere occurs at the pole, while it occurs on the equator\nfor a transverse projection (also called equatorial in this case). For an arbitrary\npoint of contact, the projection is said to be oblique.\n\nThe computer software Atlas which we have devised is coupled with the\norbitography part of our program Ixion. Any satellite ground track can thus\nbe mapped out with the chosen projection. In each representation, every ef-\nfort is made to apply the most suitable cartographic projection. On all the\nmaps presented here, plotted using Atlas, we indicate the main features of the\nprojection: name, properties, type, and aspect. Also given in the key are the\ncoordinates (longitude and latitude) of the center of the map, together with\nthe three Euler angles which define the rotation of the globe for the projection\nfrom the standard initial position.\n\nThe projections used in the present book can be grouped as follows:\n\n\u2022 Conformal Projections. Angles are conserved here. In particular, the an-\ngle between the ground track (of the satellite or its swath) and the given\nmeridian is conserved. The main projections here are:\n\n\u2013 The Mercator projection.\n\u2013 The stereographic projection.\n\u2013 The projections due to Guyou, Adams, and Peirce, based on elliptic\n\nintegrals of the first kind.\n\n\u2022 Equal-Area Projections. These projections are used when it is important to\nrespect surface areas. The main projections used in this book are:\n\n\u2013 The Behrmann projection (dilated Lambert equal-area cylindrical pro-\njection) and the Lorgna projection.\n\n\n\n8.5 Appendix: Cartographic Projections 331\n\n\u2013 The Mollweide and Sanson projections.\n\u2013 The Craster parabolic, Boggs eumorphic, or Goode homolosine projec-\n\ntions, often in interrupted form.\n\u2013 The Hammer\u2013Aitoff and Hammer\u2013Wagner projections.\n\n\u2022 Perspective Projections. Although they have no special properties, these\nprojections are rather visual, representing the planet as if it were seen from\nspace, viewed from various distances. The main projections used are:\n\n\u2013 The perspective view projection, where the viewing point is at a finite\ndistance (expressed as a number of planetary radii).\n\n\u2013 The orthographic projection, where the viewing point is at infinity. This\nis the projection used to represent, not the ground track, but the orbit\nof the satellite in 3D, in such a way as to make the altitude apparent.\n\n\u2013 The Armadillo projection, due to Raisz, which represents the sphere in\na rather picturesque manner, projected on a torus.\n\n\u2022 Specific Projections. In 1977, the American cartographer John P. Snyder\n(1926\u20131997) invented a specific projection to represent satellite ground\ntracks for the satellite ERTS-1 (Landsat-1) and the following satellites in\nthe Landsat programme. This satellite-tracking projection keeps the merid-\nians regularly spaced and modifies the spacing of the parallels in such a\nway that the satellite ground track is a straight line. We have adapted this\nto any type of satellite. We shall return to this in more detail below.\n\n\u2022 Archaic Projection. The so-called plate-carre?e projection is very frequently\n(if not exclusively) used in books and documents concerned with satellite\nground tracks. It represents longitudes and latitudes linearly along the\nabscissa and ordinate, respectively. This projection is somewhat simple-\nminded (amounting to x = ?, y = ?), even primitive (it was fashionable\n. . . in the Middle Ages). It has no particular properties, being neither\nconformal nor equal-area, and its only mathematical value is its simplicity.\nThis is no longer an argument with the advent of computer programming.\nIt has not been used here, except for the first map (see Fig. 8.3) at the\nbeginning of the chapter (not wishing to upset habits too early on).\n\n8.5.3 Description of Three Projections\n\nHere we give brief descriptions of two of the best known conformal pro-\njections, the stereographic projection and the Mercator projection. We also\npresent the Snyder projection, which is specific to satellites. In all three cases,\nthe Earth is treated as spherical with radius R = 1, and the latitude ? is the\ngeocentric latitude.\n\n\n\n332 Chapter 8. Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nMercator Projection\n\nIn its direct aspect, a cylindrical projection can be written in the form\n\n{\nx = ? ,\ny = f(?) .\n\n(8.53)\n\nMeridians are represented by equidistant lines, perpendicular to the equator.\nParallels are straight lines parallel with the equator, hence perpendicular to\nthe meridians, and whose positions on the map depend only on the latitude.\n\nFor such a projection to be conformal, the function f(?) has to be suitably\nchosen. For a cylindrical projection, this function is unique. It is traditionally\ndenoted by L(?). The spacing between parallels is greater as one moves away\nfrom the equator. If two meridians are separated by ?? in longitude, their\nseparation on the globe is R?? cos? at latitude ?, going from R?? at the\nequator to 0 at the poles.\n\nSince the cylindrical projection maintains constant separations between\nthe meridians on the map, the parallels must be separated by an amount\nproportional to the integral of 1/ cos?. The reciprocal of cos? is sometimes\ndenoted by sec?, abbreviation for the trigonometric function secant. The\nfunction L(?) is obtained from\n\nL(?) =\n? ?\n0\n\ndu\n\ncosu\n. (8.54)\n\nThis integral defines the unique conformal cylindrical projection, known as\nthe Mercator projection:\n\n??\n?\n\nx = ? ,\n\ny = ln tan\n\n(\n?\n\n4\n+\n\n?\n\n2\n\n)\n,\n\n(8.55)\n\nwhich brings in the natural or Napierian logarithm of the tangent.\nIn its direct equatorial form, this projection is rarely used beyond 60?. The\n\npoles are pushed to infinity.9 In its transverse form, the Mercator projection\nis called the Gauss projection, or the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM).\n\n9Certain cylindrical projections, such as the Arden\u2013Close or Miller projections, are in-\ntended to \u201cimprove\u201d Mercator, representing the poles by means of mathematical tricks.\nHowever, they thereby stray from the basic motivation for the Mercator projection, namely,\nthe property of being conformal.\n\n\n\n8.5 Appendix: Cartographic Projections 333\n\nThe first direct conformal cylindrical map of the world was established in\n1569 by Mercator10 for the purposes of navigation (ad usum navigantium). It\nproved extremely useful to mariners.11\n\nMercator never explained his method. We now know that he carried out\nthe integration of the secant by hand, as it were, taking steps of the order\nof one degree. He did not know about logarithms, a theory established only\nin 1614 by John Napier (or Neper), whence the name Napierian logarithm.\nThe Mercator projection was formulated mathematically in 1599 by Edward\nWright.\n\nFig. 8.7 :Frontispiece of the 1595 edition of the\n\nMercator Atlas.\n\n10Gerardus Mercator (1512\u20131594) was a Flemish mathematician and geographer. (At this\ntime, university members commonly Latinised their names. In this case, Gerhard Kremer\nchanged his name to Gerardus Mercator, since mercator means \u201cmerchant\u201d in Latin, just as\nkremer does in Flemish.) He made globes, maps, and astronomical instruments for Charles\nQuint. Realising that accurate maps were not only useful for navigation but had strategic\nand commercial importance, he established the first conformal cylindrical projection and\nthereby founded modern mathematical cartography. His main work was the Atlas sive cos-\nmographic\u00e6 meditationes de fabrica mundi et fabricati figura, a huge collection of maps,\nnot all of which use the Mercator projection. The Atlas was expanded and re-edited many\ntimes. After his death, his son Rumold, then the geographer Jocodus Hondius, continued\nthis work of cartography and edition. For his first collection of maps in 1583, Mercator chose\nthe name \u201cAtlas\u201d and illustrated the frontispiece of the work with the picture in Fig. 8.7 of\nthe Greek god Atlas, who holds up the sky and observes the Earth from above. Later, the\nword \u201catlas\u201d would become the standard name for this type of geographical work.\n\n11One first determines the shortest path between two points (orthodromy). This is then\nplotted on the Mercator map and approximated by a succession of straight-line segments\n(loxodromy). The Mercator map indicates the course to follow and hold, since the projection\nis conformal.\n\n\n\n334 Chapter 8. Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nBy the end of the twentieth century, several commentators (not cartogra-\nphers) had asserted that the Mercator projection was politically incorrect.12\n\nSo here is an unexpected property of the logarithm!\n\nSnyder Projection\n\nThe Snyder projection is a projection of cylindrical type, with longitudes\nregularly spaced on the map. In order to represent the ground tracks by\nstraight-line segments, the latitude and longitude must be linearly related\nover a given revolution. Using the relation (8.47), we obtain\n\n{\nx = ?? ?AN ,\ny = arcsin\n\ntan?\n\ntan i\n? 1\n\n?\narcsin\n\nsin?\n\nsin i\n,\n\n(8.56)\n\nwhere x and y are Cartesian coordinates on the map and ?AN is the longitude\nof the initial ascending node. The latitudes are thus \u201cdilated\u201d as one moves\naway from the equator. The projection is shown in Figs. 8.8 and 8.9, with\ndifferent dilations for the latitudes.\n\nThis projection only applies to circular orbits and necessarily uses geocen-\ntric latitudes.\n\nStereographic Projection\n\nThe stereographic projection13 has been the subject of considerable cov-\nerage in the literature, in proportion with the extent and variety of its ge-\nometrical properties. Here we shall explain how it works with a very simple\nexample drawn from the field of cartography.\n\n12We exemplify with two extracts to this effect:\n\nAny projection inevitably distorts, none is completely innocent. The classic projection\nin our old school atlas is the Mercator projection, based on a factitious graticule\nwhich plots not only the \u201cparallels\u201d but also the meridians as parallel straight lines.\nThe polar regions are stretched out of all proportion, while the \u201ctemperate\u201d (=\nwhite) regions occupy a much greater space than their actual area would justify. The\nequator is pushed right down to the bottom of the map, which gives a completely\nfalse impression of the ratio of land to sea.\n\nJean Chesneaux, L\u2019e?tat du Monde 1982. Annuaire e?conomique et ge?opolitique mondial,\nFranc?ois Maspero e?d., Paris 1982.\n\nThe distortions of Mercator\u2019s map did not seem strange to Europeans in the six-\nteenth century, an era of expanding colonial empires. Yet today, although European\ncolonialism belongs largely to the past, Mercator\u2019s sixteenth-century map still retains\nmuch of its grip.\n\nUnited Nations Development Programme. Maps and Map-Makers, UNESCO Courier, June\n1991.\n\n13This adjective comes from the Greek /????)\t, meaning solid, and ??\"&???, meaning\nto engrave or write. Ptolemy reports that the stereographic projection was established by\nHipparchos of Nicaea.\n\n\n\n8.5 Appendix: Cartographic Projections 335\n\nLandsat-8Landsat-8\n\nOrbit - Ground track\n\nRecurrence = [15; -7; 16] 233\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:  5760.0 min =   4.00 days\n\nAltitude =  699.6 km a = 7077.736 km\n\nInclin./SUN-SYNCHRON.=  98.21 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =    98.88 min    * rev/day =14.56\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 2751.9 km  (  24.7 \u00b0)\n\nAsc.

Choose a particular point A, called the pole of projection, the South\nPole in this application. Draw the straight line joining a point P of the sphere\nto the pole A. The intersection of the straight line with the equatorial plane\ndefines a point M which is the image of P in the stereographic projection\nwith pole A.\n\nThis transformation projects the whole sphere, excepting the point A, onto\nthe equatorial plane. The whole northern hemisphere lies within the equatorial\ncircle, while the whole southern hemisphere lies outside it. In cartography, two\nprojections are preferred, with each map being bounded by the equator, and\nchanging the pole when we change hemisphere. Clearly, any other point on\nthe sphere could be chosen as the pole. By taking the pole of projection on the\nequator, one obtains maps with an equatorial aspect (see Fig. 8.10). It can be\nshown that this projection is conformal. A circle on the sphere is mapped to\na circle on the plane (unless the circle passes through the pole of projection,\nwhen one obtains a straight line).\n\nA point P on the sphere is specified by its longitude ? and its geocentric\nlatitude ?. In the case discussed above, with the point A at the South Pole,\nthe angle at the center (AO,OP ) represents the colatitude of the point P ,\nand it is twice the inscribed angle (AO,AP ):\n\n(AO,OP ) =\n?\n\n2\n? ? , (AO,AP ) = ?\n\n4\n? ?\n\n2\n.\n\nOn the equatorial plane, the point P projects to M with the same azimuthal\nangle ?. The polar coordinates (r, ?) of M are\n\n??\n?\n\n? = ? ,\n\nr = tan\n\n(\n?\n\n4\n? ?\n\n2\n\n)\n.\n\nProjecting on the (x, y) axes, we obtain the equation for the azimuthal stere-\nographic projection:\n\n{\nx = r cos? ,\ny = r sin? .\n\n(8.57)\n\n\n\n338 Chapter 8.

If i is less than\n90?, the orbit is prograde, whereas if i is greater than 90?, it is retrograde.\nWhen i = 90?, the orbit is polar. One may say strictly polar, because when\ni lies between 80? and 100?, one often describes it as a polar orbit, whereas\nnear-polar would be more appropriate.\n\nIf i = 0? (or i = 180?, although this has never happened), the orbit is\nequatorial, and for i less than 10?, it is near-equatorial.\n\nClassification by Altitude\n\nSatellites in near-circular orbit are classified according to their mean al-\ntitude. We speak of a low Earth orbit (LEO) when the satellite flies at an\naltitude below 1,500km, a medium Earth orbit (MEO) for GPS satellites at\nan altitude of around 20,000km, and a geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) (also\nsometimes called the Clarke orbit) for geostationary satellites at an altitude\nof 36,000 km. We shall often use these abbreviations, which are concise and\n\nM. Capderou, Handbook of Satellite Orbits: From Kepler to GPS,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-03416-4 9,\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014\n\n339\n\n\n\n340 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nconsistent.1 Almost all satellites in orbits with low eccentricity fall into one\nof these three categories. (For example, it is very rare to find a satellite at an\naltitude of 8,000km.)\n\nFor highly elliptical orbits,2 such as the Molniya or Tundra orbits, we use\nthe abbreviation HEO (highly eccentric orbit). The name GTO (geostationary\ntransfer orbit) is usually a temporary one, because the satellite has been placed\non this highly eccentric orbit for transfer towards a GEO orbit. Some satellites\ncan be found in such orbits, some deliberately placed there, others because the\napogee thrust used to make the orbit circular has been unsuccessful. Finally,\nif a satellite has not been correctly placed in orbit, it is sometimes given the\ntitle FTO (failed transfer orbit)!\n\nThe orbits L1LO and L2LO refer to halo orbits around the Lagrange\npoints, which were discussed in Sect. 6.12.\n\nOrbit and Revolution\n\nSince all scientific enterprise is based on a precise use of language, one\nmust mention a very common error which consists in saying \u201corbit\u201d instead\nof \u201crevolution\u201d or \u201cround trip\u201d, an error which occurs in English, French, and\nvery likely other languages too. For example, we may read: the satellite Terra\nduring orbit 7778. . . . This confusion is unjustified, and indeed, it is never\nencountered in astronomy: one never says that the Moon makes one orbit\naround the Earth every month.\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission\n\nOur classification of satellites according to mission, which is of course\nrather arbitrary, aims to illustrate the various types of orbit. We begin with\nsatellites designed for geophysics and Earth observation, then for navigation\nand communications, astronomy, technological development, and others that\nelude straightforward classification. We shall touch briefly upon military satel-\nlites and their specific missions, and satellites carrying humans.\n\nThe mission of a satellite often covers a range of different areas, e.g., an\noceanographic satellite may also take part in a geodesy mission or a mission\nto develop altimetric techniques, and there has always been a large dose of\nideology in satellite missions, especially at the beginning of the space age.\nMore will be said about this below.\n\n1When we are referring to the satellite as LEO rather than the orbit, we understand\nof course that we mean a low-Earth orbiting satellite. One does occasionally find the term\nGEO meaning geosynchronous Earth orbit, as opposed to GSO for geostationary orbit. In\naddition, and somewhat unnecessarily, one finds the term IGSO meaning inclined geosyn-\nchronous orbit for geosynchronous orbits that are tilted and therefore not geostationary.\n\n2For Molniya-type orbits, the term THEO (12 h eccentric orbit) is sometimes used. For\nvery high orbits, like the orbit of Geotail, we use the term VHO (very high orbit).\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 341\n\nWith regard to military (or partly military) satellites, the nomenclature is\noften somewhat vague (even confused). From 1984, the United States called\nsome of its satellites USA followed by a number specifying order of launch.\nPreviously, these satellites had been called OPS followed by a four-figure num-\nber, without chronological ordering. Between 1964 and 1984, more than 400\nOPS satellites were launched.3 The USSR, then Russia, also created confu-\nsion with its Kosmos satellites: this name (from the Russian word kocmoc,\noriginating itself from the Greek word ? ??????, ??, meaning \u201corder\u201d or \u201cwell-\nordered\u201d, hence \u201cuniverse\u201d) groups a whole multitude4 of satellites (not al-\nways military), on every kind of orbit and for every available type of mission.\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China did likewise with the appellation DFH (Dong\nFang Hong, where dong fang means \u201cOrient\u201d and hong means \u201cred\u201d), which\ncovers the great majority of Chinese satellites. Without doing anything to\nsimplify the situation, these satellites are also recorded by Western organisa-\ntions under the appellation PRC (People\u2019s Republic of China), with a different\nnumbering system.\n\nIn the Japanese tradition, every satellite gets two names, the first, in En-\nglish (a name or acronym), and the second in Japanese, provided that the\nlaunch is successful, e.g., the satellite GOSat became Ibuki. This tradition\n(or should one say superstition?) is also to be found with the US organisation\nNOAA: it attributes a letter to the satellite, and this letter becomes a number\nafter the launch. The satellite NOAA-N became NOAA-18, while NOAA-B,\nthe second in the series, does not appear in the numbering system, because it\nwas not inserted into the correct orbit.5\n\nSatellites placed in orbit by the US Space Shuttle are indicated as follows:\nlaunched by STS-(number). An unspecified member of a satellite series is\ndenoted by -n, e.g., Molniya-n.\n\nLaunch dates are noted up to 1 July 2013.\n\n9.2.1 The First Satellites\n\nConvinced of their supremacy in space, the United States spent the 1950s\nengaged in fierce internal competition over who would be first to put an arti-\n\n3In fact, 418 satellites were launched, from OPS/3367 on 19 January 1964 to OPS/8424\non 17 April 1984.\n\n4The launch dates were as follows: Kosmos-1 (or Sputnik-11) on 16 March 1962, Kosmos-\n1001 on 4 April 1978, and Kosmos-2001 on 14 February 1989. The launch rate then\nsubsided somewhat. We give here the last Kosmos launched in the given year: Kosmos-\n2054 (1989), Kosmos-2120 (1990), Kosmos-2174 (1991), Kosmos-2229 (1992), Kosmos-\n2267 (1993), Kosmos-2305 (1994), Kosmos-2325 (1995), Kosmos-2336 (1996), Kosmos-\n2348 (1997), Kosmos-2364 (1998), Kosmos-2368 (1999), Kosmos-2376 (2000), Kosmos-\n2386 (2001), Kosmos-2396 (2002), Kosmos-2404 (2003), Kosmos-2412 (2004), Kosmos-\n2417 (2005), Kosmos-2424 (2006), Kosmos-2436 (2007), Kosmos-2448 (2008), Kosmos-2458\n(2009), Kosmos-2469 (2010), Kosmos-2478 (2011), Kosmos-2481 (2012). Since 2000, the\nGlonass satellites half made up half of the Kosmos series.\n\n5Note that, of the first 20 NOAA launches, 19 have been successful.\n\n\n\n342 Chapter 9.

The two parties were the US Navy with its Vanguard\nproject and the US Army with the Orbiter project. But from 1955, the for-\nmer, with its powerful and effective Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), was\nsole leader in the \u201crace into space\u201d, as they prepared to launch the tiny device\nnicknamed the grapefruit satellite (1.5 kg). Then on 4 October 1957, the USSR\nshook the world with Sputnik-1, a satellite weighing in at 84 kg (see Figs. 9.1\nand 9.2).\n\nThe US government, which was to take a second uppercut on 3 November\nwith the successful appearance of Sputnik-2 on the scene, this time weighing\nin at 508kg (including a dog), was quick to react. The US army launched\nthe Explorer programme in collaboration with the Jet Propulsion Labora-\ntory/California Institute of Technology (JPL/Caltech). On 31 January 1958,\nExplorer-1 (14 kg) was successfully launched (see Fig. 9.3). After several failed\nlaunches, Vanguard-1 was placed in orbit on 17 March 1958. The US govern-\nment put a stop to this dual development by founding the National Aeronau-\ntics and Space Administration (NASA) on 1 October 1958.\n\nFor any country, the act of placing its first satellite in orbit with its own\nrocket system carries a significant ideological connotation. There is no need to\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 343\n\nFig. 9.3 :The three mission\n\nleaders for Explorer-1:\n\nW.H. Pickering (director\n\nof JPL/satellite), J.

The symbolic message was also military during\nthe Cold War: if we can launch a satellite, we can also launch a nuclear\nwarhead!\n\nAfter the two superpowers, as they were considered at the time, de Gaulle\u2019s\nFrance launched its own satellite A-1 (known as Aste?rix) on 26 November\n1965. Then followed the two main Asian nations, Japan with Ohsumi and\nChina with DFH-1. In 1971, the United Kingdom, with X-3 (known as Pros-\npero) also showed that it had the knowhow. Other firsts occurred on a more\nstrained geopolitical stage. One could mention India with Rohini (or RS-1)\nand Israel with Ofeq-1 in 1980, and when Iran launched Omid-1 (meaning\n\u201chope\u201d in Farsi) in 2009, using an Iranian rocket, the ideological aim was\nclearly stated in a presidential announcement.6\n\nIn 2012, NORAD confirmed that North Korea had placed the satellite\nKwangmyongsong-3-2 (\u201cstar of hope\u201d) in orbit using a local launch system.\n\n6In the dramatic words of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: \u201cIran\u2019s presence in space,\nwith the aim of expanding monotheism, peace, and justice, has now been officially recorded\nin history.\u201d Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Tehran, 3 February 2009.\n\n\n\n344 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\n9.2.2 Satellites for Geodesy\n\nWe have already mentioned these satellites in Chap. 3, where we gave a\ncomplete list of the satellites used for the geopotential models JGM, EGM,\nGRIM, and EIGEN.\n\nThe satellite Sputnik-2 can be considered as a geodesy satellite. In the be-\nginnings of space-based geodesy, many satellites were placed above the LEO al-\ntitude in order to reduce atmospheric drag. Examples are PAGEOS, launched\nin 1966, between 3,000 and 5,200km, with i = 84.4?, and the two LAGEOS\n(Laser Geodynamics Satellite), in high circular orbits with h = 5,900km and\ninclinations i = 109.8? for LAGEOS-1 and i = 52.6? for LAGEOS-2. The\nground tracks of LAGEOS-1 and LAGEOS-2 are shown in Fig. 9.4.\n\nThe satellites SECOR-7, -8, and -9 at 3,700km altitude and the Soviet\nsatellites Etalon-1 and -2 (Kosmos-1989 and -2024), launched in 1989 with\nGlonass, are in a circular MEO orbit with h = 19,130km and i = 64.8?.\nOthers are at altitudes between 1,000 and 1,500km: the fifteen Soviet Geo-\n1K satellites, such as Kosmos-2226, the French Starlette satellite, and the US\npioneer ANNA-1B, launched in 1962, h = 1,120 km, i = 50.1?. Also in this\ncategory is the Japanese satellite EGP (Ajisai), whose ground track is shown\nin Fig. 9.5 (lower). The Japanese satellite LRE (Laser Ranging Experiment),\nlaunched into an eccentric orbit in 2001, with hp = 271km, ha = 36,214km,\ni = 28?, is equipped with 126 laser reflectors.\n\nThere are some Sun-synchronous satellites between 800 and 1,000km,\nsuch as TOPO-1 and those launched after 1993, Stella and Westpac-1 (Sun-\nsynchronous because they are microsatellites that were themselves launched\nwith Sun-synchronous satellites). Since then, geodesy satellites have been\nplaced in lower orbits. An example is GFZ-1 (Geo Forschungs Zentrum),\nlaunched in 1995, with h = 380 km and i = 51.6?.\n\nOur knowledge of the geopotential has become so precise that a whole\nnew generation of geodesy satellites7 has been put in operation since 2000.\nThey carry ultra-sensitive accelerometers. Their altitudes must be as low as\npossible for better detection of gravitational anomalies, while a continuous\nthrust compensates for the higher level of atmospheric drag.8 as we have\nseen in Chap. 3 for the satellites CHAMP, GRACE, and GOCE (see Figs. 3.6\nand 3.7).\n\nThe Italian satellite LARES (Laser Relativity Satellite, also known as\nLAGEOS-3, see Fig. 9.5 upper),9 with h = 1,442 km and i = 69.49?, works\n\n7Launch dates: CHAMP on 15 June 2000, GRACE-A and -B on 17 March 2002, and\nGOCE on 17 March 2009.\n\n8At this altitude, and for GOCE with mass 800 kg, the acceleration due to atmospheric\nfriction is 1.5 \u00d7 10?5 ms?2, whereas the acceleration due to radiation pressure is a mere\n6.1 \u00d7 10?8 ms?2. This can be compared with 6.0 \u00d7 10?8 and 3.7 \u00d7 10?8 for ?SCOPE, a\n120 kg satellite planned for circular orbit at an altitude of 700 km.\n\n9Launch dates: LAGEOS-1 on 4 May 1976, LAGEOS-2 on 23 October 1992 (by STS-52),\nLARES on 13 February 2012.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 345\n\nLAGEOS-1\nOrbit - Ground track\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:  1440.0 min =   1.00 day\n\nAltitude = 5891.9 km a =12270.012 km\n\nInclination  = 109.81 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   225.49 min    * rev/day = 6.39\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 6286.6 km  (  56.5 \u00b0)\n\nAsc.

We use the NORAD data for two neighbouring transits on 31 December\n2004, around 17:09 UT:\n\nGRACE-A\n\n1 27391U 02012A 04366.71456748 .00002198 00000-0 71465-4 0 8703\n\n2 27391 89.0239 219.2934 0015306 313.4780 46.5231 15.31315612155826\n\nGRACE-B\n\n1 27392U 02012B 04366.71492843 .00002319 00000-0 75411-4 0 8597\n\n2 27392 89.0243 219.2966 0016587 315.5508 44.4470 15.31314968155825\n\nWe can calculate the semi-major axis a for each orbit. The metric orbital\nelements are:\n\n\u2022 GRACE-A: a = 6,846.810km, or h = 468.7km, e = 0.0015306, i =\n89.0239?.\n\n\u2022 GRACE-B: a = 6,846.811km, or h = 468.7km, e = 0.0016587, i =\n89.0243?.\n\nThe NORAD times t0A and t0B deduced from the TLE are:\n\n\u2022 t0A = 17:08:58.630 UT for GRACE-A.\n\u2022 t0B = 17:09:29.816 UT for GRACE-B.\n\nWith ? and v (deduced from M and e), we calculate the ascending node\ncrossing times tA and tB of the satellites (see Example 8.6):\n\n\u2022 tA = 17:08:56.620 UT for GRACE-A.\n\u2022 tB = 17:09:27.767 UT for GRACE-B.\n\nIn the Galilean frame, the difference between the longitudes of the ascending\nnode is obtained directly from the TLE (the nodal precession over 2 s, the\ntime elapsed between t0A and tA, is negligible):\n\n\u2022 ?? = ?B ??A = 219.2966? ? 219.2934? = 0.0032?.\n\nThe two orbits are practically identical (?a = 1m) and lie in the same plane\n(?? = 11 arcsec). The two satellites thus follow one another around this\ncommon orbit. The time difference is\n\n\u2022 ?t = tB ? tA = 31.147 s.\n\n\n\n348 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nHowever, in the terrestrial frame, the ground tracks are distinct and \u201cparallel\u201d.\nFor the longitude of the ascending node, calculation gives\n\n\u2022 ?A = 221.5933? for GRACE-A and ?B = 221.4663? for GRACE-B.\n\nThe difference in longitude is therefore\n\n\u2022 ?? = ?B ? ?A = ?0.1270?.\n\nThis corresponds to 14 km on the equator. It also corresponds to the following\ninterval of time for the Earth\u2019s rotation in the Galilean frame:\n\n\u2022 ?t? = ???/??T = 30.381 s .\n\nIf we transform the angular increment ?? into time using\n\n?t? = ???/??T = 0.766 s ,\n\nwe obtain finally,\n\n\u2022 ?t? +?t? = 30.381 + 0.766 = 31.147 s.\n\nThis is the value found above for ?t.\nIn order to establish the local crossing time at the ascending node, we\n\ncalculate the time in LMT:\n\n\u2022 ?A = 7.92195 and ?B = 7.92214.\n\nThis is almost the same time for the two satellites:\n\n\u2022 ?A = 07:55:19 and ?B = 07:55:20.\n\nThe difference is just ?t? . At the equator, the speed of the two satellites is\n7.630km/s and the speed of the ground track is 7.108km/s. The difference\nbetween the two GRACE satellites is thus 237.9 km in space and 221.7 km for\nthe ground tracks.\n\nFigure 9.7 illustrates the above calculations. ?\n\n9.2.3 Earth Environment Satellites\n\nTerrestrial Magnetic Field and Its Manifestations\n\nTo study the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, two satellites are in Sun-synchronous\nLEO, but elliptical orbit, namely the American MagSat (Magnetic field Satel-\nlite, AEM-3, Explorer-61), launched in 1979, with hp = 352km, ha = 561km,\nand i = 96.8?, and the Danish \u00d8rsted, launched in 1999, with hp = 450km,\nha = 850km, and i = 96.5\n\n?.\nTo study the radiation belts, the Chinese satellite SJ-5 (Shi Jian-5, DFH-\n\n47, where shi jian means \u201cachievement\u201d), launched in 1999 at the same time\nas FY-1C (DFH-46), is in a circular Sun-synchronous orbit with h = 855km.\nThe military aspects of this study have been entrusted to the six satellites\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 349\n\nGP-B\nOrbit - ref.: Earth\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:  2880.0 min =   2.00 days\n\nAltitude =  650.0 km a = 7028.136 km\n\nInclination  =  90.00 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =    97.86 min    * rev/day =14.72\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 2730.9 km  (  24.5 \u00b0)\n\nAsc.

On a Sun-synchronous orbit at\nh = 600 km, they follow each other at an interval of 1min.\n\nIn near-polar LEO orbit, between 800 and 1,000km, are the even-numbered\nOGO satellites (Orbiting Geophysical Observatory), OGO-2, -4, and -6,\nknown as POGO (Polar OGO), launched between 1965 and 1969, the Swedish\nsatellites Astrid-1 and -2, launched in 1995 and 1998, and the strictly polar\nsatellite Polar BEAR (Beacon Experiments and Auroral Research).\n\nMagnetosphere and Heliosphere\n\nTo study the magnetosphere, that is, the zone of interaction between par-\nticles excited by the solar wind and the Earth\u2019s magnetic field, satellite orbits\nhave to be very high and highly elliptical. The first US satellite to be placed\nin orbit, Explorer-1, with hp = 347 km, ha = 1,859km, and i = 33.2\n\n?, already\nhad some of these features. As we have seen, it discovered two radiation belts\naround the Earth, since referred to as the Van Allen belts. This radiation\nwas studied by the Soviet Elektron programme, for which four satellites were\nlaunched in two pairs in 1964: Elektron-1 with -2 and Elektron-3 with -4. They\nall followed eccentric orbits, with inclination i ? 61?, and with ha ? 6,500km\nfor the odd numbers, ha ? 65,000km for the even numbers.\n\nMagnetospheric studies continued with a great many satellites launched\nbetween 1964 and 1968, such as the odd-numbered OGO satellites, OGO-1, -3,\nand -5, referred to as EOGO (Eccentric OGO), Explorer-34 (IMP-F or IMP-\n5, Interplanetary Monitoring Platform), launched in 1967 with hp = 242km,\nha = 214,400 km, i = 67.1\n\n?, or Explorer-50 (IMP-J or IMP-8), launched into\na very high orbit in 1973 with variable inclination between 32? and 55? (and\nafter 30 years, this satellite is still operational). The justification for the polar\norbits of Dynamics Explorer-1 and -2 was explained in Chap. 7.\n\nFor the experiment ISEE (International Sun\u2013Earth Explorer), the two\nsatellites ISEE-1 and -2 were launched in 1977 into highly eccentric orbits,\nwith hp ? 400km, ha ? 138,000 km, i = 12.7? and 13.5?. Then in 1978,\nISEE-3 was the first satellite to be placed in a halo orbit10 around the La-\ngrange point L1, an orbit known as L1LO (see the appendix on the Lagrange\npoints in Sect. 6.12). The satellite Wind, launched in 1994, was also placed in\nan L1LO orbit around the point L1, where it remained from May 1997 until\nApril 1998. From this location, it was able to observe the solar wind before it\nbecame perturbed by the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere. It was subsequently placed\n\n10When it had accomplished its mission, the satellite was withdrawn from the point L1 in\nJune 1982. Using a lunar flyby as a gravity-assist maneuver, it was removed from the Earth\u2019s\ngravitational attraction and sent into heliocentric orbit for the ICE mission (International\nCometary Explorer), in an encounter with a comet (perihelion 0.93 a.u., aphelion 1.03 a.u.,\ninclination 0.1?, period 355 day).\n\n\n\n352 Chapter 9.

The satellite ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer, Explorer-\n71), launched in 1997, is also in an L1LO orbit.\n\nWe should also mention the highly eccentric orbits of the following satel-\nlites: Interkosmos-24, a Soviet satellite launched in 1989, hp = 511km,\nha = 2,950km, i = 82.6\n\n?, with Magion-2 (see Fig. 9.11); Geotail (or GTL,\nGeomagnetic Tail Laboratory), a Japanese satellite launched in 1992, hp =\n41,360km, ha = 508,500 km, i = 22.4\n\n?; Polar, launched in 1996, on an or-\nbit with variable parameters,12 a ? 60,000 km, e ? 0.7, i ? 80?; FAST\n(Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer, SMEX-2, Explorer-70), launched in 1996,\nhp = 353 km, ha = 4,163 km, i = 83.0\n\n?, (see Fig. 9.10 upper); Equator-S,\nlaunched in 1997, hp = 496 km, ha = 67,230km, i = 7.0\n\n? (orbit obtained\nby transfer via a GTO orbit); IMAGE (Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora\nGlobal Exploration, MIDEX-1, Explorer-78), launched in 2000, on a polar\norbit with hp ? 1,000 km and ha of the order of seven Earth radii.\n\nTo study the Van Allen radiation belts, NASA placed the two satellites\nRBSP-A and -B (Radiation Belt Storm Probe) on a GTO orbit in 2012. They\nwere later renamed the Van Allen Probes (see Fig. 9.8). With hp ? 550km\nand ha ? 31,100 km (a = 21,980km, e = 0.682), these twin satellites have\na period of T = 540min, or 9 h, and make frequent crossings of the belt\nunder investigation (see also the STRV satellites discussed under technological\nsatellites and shown in Fig. 9.9).\n\nThe Russian Interball experiment is based on Interball Tail (or Interball-\nS2-X, Interbol-1, Prognoz-11), launched in 1995 on a highly elliptical orbit\nwith period T = 91h, and Interball Aurora (or Interball-S2-A, Interbol-2,\nPrognoz-12), launched in 1996 on a Molniya orbit. In each case, the Czech\nsatellites Magion (Magnetosphere\u2013Ionosphere),Magion-4 then Magion-5, were\nlaunched jointly with an Interball satellite. The orbit of the forthcoming\nInterbol-3 is planned for ha = 400,000km. We also mention the Chinese satel-\nlite KF1-SJ-4 (Shi Jian-4, DFH-38), launched in 1994 on a GTO orbit with\ni = 28.6?.\n\nTo study the magnetosphere and phenomena related to the aurora bo-\nrealis, between 1978 and 1989, Japan sent four satellites EXOS (Exospheric\nObservations) into alternately low and high eccentric orbits, with i = 69? for\n\n11The satellite left the point L1 in the Earthward direction, roughly in the plane of the\nlunar orbit, before moving into the petal orbit. In this configuration, the satellite moves\nalternately behind the Earth and the Moon.

The Double Star programme comprises two Chinese\nsatellites carrying European instruments similar to those designed for Clus-\nter, in eccentric orbits,14 with perigee at 600km altitude. The first, DSP-1,\nha = 79,000km, is in an equatorial orbit, and the second, DSP-2, ha =\n39,000km, is in a polar orbit.\n\nThe satellite IBEX (Interstellar Boundary Explorer, SMEX-10, Explorer-\n91) is on a very high near-equatorial orbit with a period of 7.6 days.15\n\nChina is pursuing its efforts in this field with the Kua Fu mission: they have\nplaced one satellite, Kua Fu-A, at the Lagrange point L1, and two satellites,\nKua Fu-B1 and -B2, in polar LEO orbit.\n\nThe five satellites of the US mission THEMIS (Time History of Events\nand Macroscale Interactions during Substorms, MIDEX-5)16 were launched\ntogether on 17 February 2007. The aim is to unambiguously determine17 the\nregions where magnetic substorms are triggered and study the reconnection\nmodes of the magnetic tail. There are five phases to the mission. (a)\u2014First\nPhase. The five satellites are on the same orbit: hp = 470km, ha = 87,333km\n(or 15.4R, where R is the Earth radius), i = 16.0?. (b)\u2014Dawn Phase. The\napogee ha of each satellite is modified: 30R for THEMIS-1, 20R for THEMIS-\n2, 12R for THEMIS-3 and -4, 10R for THEMIS-5. At the apogee, the satellites\nare situated above places where it is dawn on Earth. (c)\u2014Tail Phase. The\norbits remain unchanged, but owing to the motion of the Earth about the Sun,\nthe satellites reach apogee at midnight. (d)\u2014Dusk Phase. The satellites reach\napogee at dusk. (e)\u2014Final Phase. The apogee lies Sunward, with passage at\nnoon.\n\n13These satellites, Rumba, Salsa, Samba, and Tango, fly a few hundred kilometers apart.\nThey were launched in two stages, on 16 June and 19 August 2000, to avoid repetition of\nthe disaster when Cluster was launched together on 4 June 1996.\n\n14DSP-1 (also called Tan Ce-1, meaning Explorer-1 in Chinese, or TC-1), a = 46,148.1 km,\ne = 0.8494, i = 28.5?, launched on 29 December 2003. DSP-2 (Tan Ce-2 or TC-2), a =\n26,228.1 km, e = 0.7301, i = 90?, launched on 26 July 2004.\n\n15Launch date 19 October 2008 and orbital characteristics hp = 1.5R, ha = 47.8R,\na = 163,000 km, e = 0.9025, i = 10.993?, T = 183 h.\n\n16This is one of the Explorer missions. The satellites are also called Explorer-85, -86, -87,\n-88, and -89. In the MIDEX-5 framework, they are referred to as MIDEX-5A to -5E.\n\n17It was the idea of a clear and objective determination that led to the name of this\nmission, THEMIS, from the Greek goddess of justice ? 1???\t? ???\t, or Themis. She sits\nat the deliberations of gods and men and in each instance preserves the equity of their\ndecisions.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 357\n\nFor such satellites, precessional motions are very slow18 and each orbit\nthus remains practically fixed relative to a Galilean frame. At the end of 1\nyear, the mission was extended. The values hp = 470km and i = 16.0\n\n? were\nmaintained throughout the whole mission.\n\nThe US project MMS (Magnetospheric Multiscale) plans to operate four\nsatellites in formation, at the vertices of a tetrahedron. The inclination of the\norbit is i = 28.5? and the perigee remains constant at rp = 1.2R. Concerning\nthe apogee, ra = 12.83R (T = 1.09 day) in phase 1, then goes to ra = 25.0R\n(T = 2.78 day) in phase 2. The European project Cross-Scale will use a flotilla\nof seven satellites on an orbit with rp = 10R, ra = 25R, i = 14\n\n?, and ? = 205?,\ngiving a period of T = 4.3 day.\n\nIonosphere\n\nTo study the ionosphere,19 there are the US satellites UARS (Upper\nAtmosphere Research Satellite), h = 570 km, i = 56.9?, and TIMED\n(Thermo-Iono-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics), h = 625km, i = 74.0?.\nIn addition, there is the Taiwanese satellite Rocsat-1 (Republic of China Satel-\nlite), with a slightly inclined orbit, h = 630km, i = 35? (for an oceanographic\nmission) and many Interkosmos, such as Interkosmos-12, several Kosmos, such\nas Kosmos-196, and the Chinese satellites Atmosphere-1 and -2 (DFH-31 and\n-32), which are Sun-synchronous with h = 800 km and h = 610 km. The\nsatellite SAMPEX (Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer,\nSMEX-1, Explorer-68) is near-polar, with hp = 506 km, ha = 670km, and\ni = 81.7? (Fig. 9.11).\n\n9.2.4 Satellites for Meteorology and Climate Study\n\nMeteorology and the Study of the Atmosphere\n\nThe possibility of observation from space aroused the interest of meteo-\nrologists from an early stage. It was their dream to know the global state of\nthe atmosphere in a single glance! In order to do so, the orbits used have\nalways been Sun-synchronous LEO orbits (see Fig. 9.12) or GEO orbits (see\nFig. 9.13), apart from the first satellites and the Meteor satellites.\n\nLEO Meteorological Satellites\n\nIn the case of NASA\u2019s NIMBUS programme,20 the seven satellites were\nSun-synchronous, from Nimbus-1 to Nimbus-6, on a fairly high LEO orbit\n\n18For the satellites in Phase 1, the nodal precession rate is ?? = 0.10 round/year, the\napsidal precession rate is ?? = 0.20 round/year.\n\n19Launch dates: UARS on 12 September 1991 (STS-48); TIMED on 7 December 2001\n(with Jason-1 but in a different orbit); Rocsat-1 on 27 January 1999; Interkosmos-12 on\n30 October 1974; Atmosphere-1 and -2 (DFH-31 and -32) on 3 September 1990; SAMPEX\non 3 July 1992.\n\n20Launch dates: Nimbus-1 on 28 August 1964; Nimbus-2 on 15 May 1966, Nimbus-3 on\n14 April 1969; Nimbus-4 on 8 April 1970; Nimbus-5 on 11 December 1972; Nimbus-6 on 12\nJune 1975; Nimbus-7 on 24 October 1978.\n\n\n\n358 Chapter 9.

Orbit and Mission\n\nwith h = 1,100km and i = 99.9?, while Nimbus-7 followed a slightly lower\norbit with h = 950km and i = 99.1?.\n\nThe programme run by what is known today as the National Oceanic\nand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the American meteorological of-\nfice, can be divided into five series: TIROS (Television and Infra Red Obser-\nvation Satellite), TOS (TIROS Operational System), ITOS (Improved TOS),\nTIROS-N and ATN (Advanced TIROS-N). The first comprises 12 satellites\nand began on 1 April 1960 with the launch of the first meteorological satel-\nlite,21 TIROS-1. Up to TIROS-8, launched in 1963, the orbits were similar,\nwith h ? 680 km and i between 48? and 58?. Subsequently, all further satel-\nlites were Sun-synchronous: TIROS-9 and -10, launched in 1964, and ESSA-1\nand 2 (Environmental Science Service Administration), launched in 1966. The\nTOS series comprised seven satellites, from ESSA-3 to ESSA-9, launched from\n1966 to 1969, on the orbit h = 1,450km, i = 102?. The ITOS series used ex-\nactly the same orbit for six satellites, ITOS-1, NOAA-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, launched\nfrom 1970 to 1976. The last two series22 adopted a lower orbit: h = 800km,\ni = iHS = 98.8\n\n? for TIROS-N, with the satellites TIROS-N and NOAA-6 and\n-7; and h from 820 to 860km, i = iHS for ATN, with the satellites NOAA-8\nto -18.\n\nThe POES programme (Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satel-\nlites) concerns the two last series. Its planned successor was the NPOESS pro-\ngramme (National POES System), a joint project by several US institutions,\nnamely the NOAA, NASA, and the Department of Defense (DoD, which runs\nthe DMSP series), known as \u201cThree Agencies, One Mission\u201d, coordinated by\nthe satellite NPP (NPOESS Preparatory Project)23 at altitude h = 824km.\nThe six NPOESS satellites, from NPOESS-1 to -6, were planned to follow\nalmost the same orbit as NPP, at h = 828km.\n\nIn February 2010, the US government reconsidered the various contribu-\ntions of the NOAA, NASA, and the DoD and replaced NPOESS by JPSS\n(Joint Polar Satellite System). This new programme was based on a close\ncollaboration with the European organisation EUMETSAT and its MetOp\n\n21The three US satellites launched in 1959 had provided useful meteorological data. These\nwere Vanguard-2, Explorer-6 (first photograph of the Earth), and Explorer-7 (first data\nconcerning the Earth radiation budget). However, the first satellite devoted entirely to\nmeteorology was TIROS-1.\n\n22Launch dates: TIROS-N on 13 October 1978; NOAA-6 on 27 June 1979; NOAA-7 on\n23 June 1981; NOAA-8 on 28 March 1983; NOAA-9 on 12 December 1984; NOAA-10 on 17\nDecember 1986; NOAA-11 on 24 September 1988; NOAA-12 on 14 May 1991; NOAA-13 on\n9 August 1993, only operated for a few days; NOAA-14 on 30 December 1994; NOAA-15\non 13 May 1998; NOAA-16 on 21 September 2000; NOAA-17 on 24 June 2002; NOAA-18\non 20 May 2005; NOAA-19 on 6 February 2009.\n\n23Launch date: NPP on 28 October 2011. The National Polar-orbiting Operational En-\nvironmental Satellite System Preparatory Project (NPP) was renamed National Polar-\norbiting Partnership (NPP), and then, in January 2012, Suomi-NPP, after the American\nengineer Verner E. Suomi, considered to be the father of satellite meteorology (he built the\nfirst radiometer, aboard Explorer-7).\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 361\n\n0\u00b0\n\n30\u00b0E\n\n60\u00b0E\n\n90\u00b0E\n\n120\u00b0E\n\n150\u00b0E\n\n180\u00b0 \n150\u00b0W\n\n120\u00b0W\n\n90\u00b0W\n\n60\u00b0W\n\n30\u00b0W\n\nLocation Operator Satellite Satellite Type\n?S (series) in orbit\n\n0.0??

Orbit and Mission\n\nsatellite. However, in 2011, the DoD decided to carry out its own programme,\nDWSS (Defense Weather Satellite System). To be continued (see the appendix\nin Sect. 9.3).\n\nThe military satellites DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program)\nsupply some data to the civilian sector. They are all Sun-synchronous, often\nfollowing slightly elliptical orbits, with h between 750 and 850 km, i = iHS\nfrom 98.6? to 99.2?. There were thirteen satellites launched from 1965 to 1969\nfor the first block (Block 4), from DMSP-4A F-1 (OPS/6026) to DMSP-4A\nF-13 (also called DMSP-4B F-3, or OPS/1127). The second block (Block 5)\nbegan in 1970 with DMSP-5A F-1 (OPS/0054) and is still running,24 with\nthe extension Block 5D3.\n\nSoviet then Russian meteorological satellites25 were not Sun-synchronous\nuntil 2001. They fall into three Meteor series, with near-polar LEO orbits. The\nfirst two series involved 48 satellites: Meteor-1, from Meteor-1-01 in 1969 to\nMeteor-1-27 in 1977, with h = 870km, i = 81.2?; Meteor-2, from Meteor-2-01\nin 1975 to Meteor-2-21 in 1993, with h = 940 km, i = 82.5?. The third series\ninvolved six satellites in slightly higher orbits, with h = 1,200km, i = 82.6?.\nThe new generation, known as Meteor-M, are Sun-synchronous. The first of\nthe series is Meteor-M-1, h = 816 km, i = iHS = 98.8\n\n?, ?AN = 21:30.\nThe Chinese satellites26 in the FY-odd series (FY-1 and FY-3, where\n\nFY stands for Feng Yun, and feng yun means \u201cwind and cloud\u201d) are Sun-\nsynchronous with h = 858 km for FY-1 and h = 808km for FY-3.\n\nThe European MetOp satellites27 (Meteorological Operational satellites)\nare of course Sun-synchronous, at an average altitude of h = 830km.\n\nThe Rocsat-3/COSMIC mission (Constellation Observing System for Me-\nteorology, Ionosphere and Climate), renamed28 FormoSat, is a collaboration\nbetween Taiwan and the USA. It comprises a constellation of microsatellites\n\n24Launch dates: DMSP-5D2 F-8 (also called USA-26) on 20 June 1987; DMSP-5D2 F-9\n(USA-29) on 3 February 1988; DMSP-5D2 F-10 (USA-68) on 1 December 1990; DMSP-\n5D2 F-11 (USA-73) on 28 November 1991; DMSP-5D2 F-12 (USA-106) on 29 August 1994;\nDMSP-5D2 F-13 (USA-109) on 24 March 1995; DMSP-5D2 F-14 (USA-131) on 4 April\n1997; DMSP-5D3 F-15 (USA-147) on 12 December 1999; DMSP-5D3 F-16 (USA-172) on\n18 October 2003; DMSP-5D3 F-17 (USA-191) on 4 November 2006; DMSP-5D3 F-18 (USA-\n210) on 18 October 2009. The DMSP series should contain two more satellites, F-19 (for\n2014) and F-20 (for 2020). This should be followed by the first satellites of DWSS, viz., F-1\nand F-2.\n\n25Launch dates: Meteor-3-01 on 24 October 1985; Meteor-3-03 on 26 July 1988; Meteor-\n3-04 on 25 October 1989; Meteor-3-05 on 24 April 1991; Meteor-3-06 on 15 August 1991;\nMeteor-3-07 on 25 January 1994; Meteor-M-1 on 17 September 2009.\n\n26Launch dates: FY-1A (DFH-24) on 6 September 1988; FY-1B (DFH-30) on 3 September\n1990; FY-1C (DFH-46) on 10 May 1999; FY-1D (DFH-53) on 15 May 2002; FY-3A on 27\nMay 2008; FY-3B on 4 November 2010.\n\n27Launch dates: MetOp-A on 19 October 2006; MetOp-B on 17 September 2012. MetOp-\nC is planned for 2017. After 2020, the following series is planned: EPS-SG (European Polar\nSatellite\u2014Second Generation), with the satellites EPS-SG-A and -B.\n\n28The Rocsat satellites (Republic of China Satellites) changed name in 2005 to become\nFormoSat, recalling the old name for the island of Taiwan, viz., Formosa or Ilha Formosa\nin Portugues.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 363\n\nflying at h = 800 km with inclination i = 72?, there being three planes contain-\ning two satellites each. Launched in 2006, the six satellites, from FormoSat-3A\nto FormoSat-3F, monitor the water vapour and other components of the at-\nmosphere by radio-occultation of the GPS signal.\n\nGEO Meteorological Satellites\n\nThe geostationary programme has been very widely developed for the pur-\nposes of operational meteorology. In order to avoid large distortions due to the\nviewing angle, the various meteorological institutions have sought to distribute\ntheir satellites as harmoniously as possible around the geostationary orbit, un-\nder the coordination of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), see\nFig. 9.14.\n\nIn the United States, these satellites are placed alternately on the longi-\ntudes of the east and west coasts. This approach was already in use for the\nSMS satellites (SMS-1 with ?S = 75\n\n?W; SMS-2 with ?S = 115?W) and was\ncontinued with the GOES series29 (Geostationary Operational Environmen-\ntal Satellite) and GOES-Next, the satellites begin designated GOES-East or\nGOES-West in the obvious way. The satellite GIFTS (Geosynchronous Imag-\ning Fourier Transform Spectrometer, or EO-3 NMP, a joint project of NASA,\nthe NOAA, and the US Navy) will be placed over the Indian ocean.\n\nFor Europe, the geostationary programme is run by EUMETSAT with\nthe METEOSAT satellites. The various operational METEOSAT satellites30\n\nhave all been placed at longitude ?S = 0\n?. Some of them can be reserved, or\n\nloaned (like METEOSAT-3 to replace GOES-E from February 1993 to May\n1995), or sent on missions (like METEOSAT-5 for the INDOEX experiment,\nExample 7.6).\n\n29Launch dates: SMS-1 on 17 May 1974; SMS-2 on 6 February 1975; GOES-1 (SMS-3)\non 16 October 1975; GOES-2 on 16 June 1977; GOES-3 on 16 June 1978; GOES-4 on\n9 September 1980; GOES-5 on 22 May 1981; GOES-6 on 28 April 1983; GOES-7 on 26\nFebruary 1987; GOES-8 on 13 April 1994; GOES-9 on 23 May 1995; GOES-10 on 25 April\n1997; GOES-11 on 3 May 2000; GOES-12 on 23 July 2001; GOES-13 on 24 May 2006;\nGOES-14 on 27 June 2009; GOES-15 on 4 March 2010.\n\n30Launch dates: METEOSAT-1 on 23 November 1977; METEOSAT-2 on 19 June 1981;\nMETEOSAT-3 on 15 June 1988; METEOSAT-4 on 6 March 1989; METEOSAT-5 on 2\nMarch 1991; METEOSAT-6 on 20 November 1993; METEOSAT-7 on 2 September 1997;\nMETEOSAT-8 (MGS-1) on 28 August 2002; METEOSAT-9 (MGS-2) on 21 December\n2005; METEOSAT-10 (MGS-3) on 5 July 2012. The MSG satellites (METEOSAT Second\nGeneration) are renamed METEOSAT when they become operational. The satellite MSG-\n4 is planned for 2014. The new series known as MTG (METEOSAT Third Generation)\nis the third generation of the METEOSAT programme, planned to run for 20 years from\n2018. It differs significantly from the first two generations, since the satellites will no longer\nspin permanently about their axis at 100 rev/min, but will have three-axis stabilisation.\nThis allows the possibility of atmospheric sounding. The MTG programme comprises six\nsatellites weighing 3 tonnes each: four MTG-I (imagers) and two MTG-S (sounders).\n\n\n\n364 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nAlthough Russia generally prefers Molniya orbits to equatorial orbits, it\nnevertheless launched the GOMS programme (Geostationary Operational Me-\nteorological Satellite) of geostationary satellites.31\n\nFor India, the INSAT series (Indian Satellite) contains satellites for the\npurposes of meteorology32 and communications.\n\nChina has launched satellites33 in the FY-even series (Feng Yun-2 and,\nfrom 2014, Feng Yun-4, not to be confused with the FY-odd series of LEO\nsatellites already mentioned, viz., FY-1 and FY-3) since 1997.\n\nSince 1977, Japan has been launching its geostationary GMS satellites34\n\n(GeostationaryMeteorological Satellite), followed by MTSAT (Multi-functional\nTransport Satellite). This programme is also called Himawari (himawari\nmeans \u201csunflower\u201d).\n\nSouth Korea also takes part in the WMO programme with COMS-1 (Com-\nmunication, Ocean, Meteorological Satellite).35\n\nFigure 9.13 shows the (official) positions of the operational satellites as of\n1 July 2013. In this distribution, one observes a large \u201chole\u201d above the Pacific,\nand very closely spaced satellites at Asian longitudes. China and India prefer\nto control their own data.\n\nSatellites for Atmospheric Studies\n\nSatellites devoted to atmospheric research fly in low orbits,36 like the two\nAEM satellites (Application Explorer Mission), HCMM (Heat Capacity Map-\nping Mission, or AEM-1) with h = 600km, i = iHS, and SAGE (Stratospheric\nAerosols and Gas Experiment, or AEM-2) with h = 600 km, i = 55?, or AIM\n(Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere) with h = 580km, i = iHS = 97.8\n\n?, or\n\n31Launch date: GOMS-1 on 31 October 1994. This series is also called Elektro and the\nsatellite thus carries the names Elektro-1 or GOMS-Elektro-1 as well as GOMS-1.\n\n32Launch dates: INSAT-1A on 10 April 1982; INSAT-1B on 30 August 1983 (launched\nby STS-8); INSAT-1C on 21 July 1988; INSAT-1D on 12 June 1990; INSAT-2A on 10 July\n1992; INSAT-2B on 23 July 1993; INSAT-2E on 3 April 1999; METSAT-1 (Kalpana-1) on\n12 September 2002; INSAT-3A on 9 April 2003; INSAT-3E on 27 September 2003. The\nMETSAT satellites are called Kalpana in homage to Kalpana Chawla, the Indian astronaut\nlost in the explosion of Columbia, STS-107, on 1 February 2003. The word kalpana means\n\u201cimagination\u201d in Sanskrit and is a female first name.\n\n33Launch dates: FY-2A (DFH-45) on 10 June 1997; FY-2B (DFH-49) on 25 June 2000;\nFY-2C on 19 October 2004; FY-2D on 8 December 2006; FY-2E on 23 December 2008.\n\n34Launch dates: GMS-1 on 14 July 1977; GMS-2 on 10 August 1981; GMS-3 on 2 August\n1984; GMS-4 on 5 September 1989; GMS-5 on 18 March 1995; MTSAT-1R (Himawari-6)\non 26 February 2005 (to replace MTSAT-1, destroyed at launch on 15 November 1999);\nMTSAT-2 (Himawari-7) on 18 February 2006.\n\n35Launch date: COMS-1 on 27 June 2010.

Orbit and Mission\n\nthe Swedish atmospheric and astrophysics satellite Odin with h = 622km,\ni = iHS, and the Canadian satellite SciSat-1 with h = 650 km, i = 73.9\n\n?.\nSatellites for ozone studies are Sun-synchronous: TOMS-EP (Total Ozone\n\nMapping Spectrometer and Earth Probe), h = 750km, was Sun-synchronous\nand its successor37 QuikTOMS should have been. Satellites studying the\ncomposition of the atmosphere, like ACE-A and ACE-B (Aerosol\u2013Cloud\u2013\nEcosystem) and GACM (Global Atmospheric Composition Mission) will also\nbe Sun-synchronous.\n\nSatellites for Climate and Climate-Change Studies\n\nClimate change is very difficult to assess from in situ measurements, which\nare necessarily incomplete and sometimes inaccurate or biased. Only numer-\nical models can teach us about the evolution of the climate over periods in\nexcess of 10 years.\n\nIn order to run general circulation models for the atmosphere and ocean\nwhich simulate the climate, a whole range of climate parameters must be as-\ncertained as accurately as possible. Among these, one could mention the type\nof cloud and the amount of water or ice it contains, the distribution of aerosols\n(dust and fine particles suspended in the air), the energy budget (incident ra-\ndiation reflected and emitted, from the ultraviolet to the far infrared), wind\nspeed and ocean currents, the roughness of the ground and development of\nvegetation, the thickness of the ice sheets, amounts of greenhouse gases, and\nthe temperature of the ground and the sea surface. Only satellites38 can deter-\nmine such parameters, which can then be integrated into computer programs\nto \u201cconstrain\u201d the model. These \u201cspace sentinels\u201d thus play a fundamental\nand determining role in the business of climate study. Here we review the\nvarious aspects that come under investigation.\n\nAt the very beginning of the space age, several satellites were equipped\nwith instruments for studying the Earth\u2019s radiation budget. However, the first\nsatellite dedicated entirely to this mission was ERBS (Earth Radiation Budget\nSatellite), launched by the Space Shuttle, with h = 600km, i = 57?. In this\nfield, important progress should be made with the ESA-JAXA mission known\nas EarthCARE (Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer), with a low\nSun-synchronous orbit, h = 394 km, i = iHS = 97.0\n\n?.\nLikewise, regarding rain measurements, several dedicated instruments have\n\nflown aboard various satellites, such as the DMSP, but the first mission en-\ntirely devoted to this issue was the US\u2013Japanese satellite TRMM (Tropical\nRainfall Measurement Mission). Its low altitude, h = 350km, is essential since\nit carries a radar designed to detect water droplets. Its inclination of i = 35?\n\nmeans that it obtains effective coverage of tropical regions (and Japan) (see\nFig. 9.15 lower). Figure 9.19 shows a TRMM image of Hurricane Katrina.\n\n37Depending how fast one writes it!

The US\u2013Argentinian\nsatellite Aquarius/SAC-D (ESSP-6), with h = 651km and i = iHS, is also\nmeasuring the salinity of the oceans.\n\nSeveral of the satellites in the so-called A-Train (discussed further below)\nstudy aerosols and clouds (Parasol, Calispo, CloudSat), the chemistry of the\natmosphere (Aura), and so on (see Fig. 9.22).\n\nThe Japanese satellite GOSat (Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite, re-\nnamed Ibuki, which means \u201cbreath\u201d in Japanese), with h = 666km, i = iHS,\nis the first to detect the concentration of CO2 (carbon dioxide) in the at-\nmosphere. The US satellite OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory) will pur-\nsue a similar mission in the A-Train. The French\u2013German project MERLIN\n(Methane Remote Sensing Lidar Mission), on a lower orbit, with h = 506km,\ni = iHS, should measure the amount of methane present in the atmosphere\n(since methane is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect).\n\nEarth Resources, Remote-Sensing, and Environment\n\nThis category contains satellites carrying instruments whose resolution at\nground level is between 50 and 5m. These satellites are all LEO and, apart\nfrom those in the Resurs-F series and a few special cases, they are all Sun-\nsynchronous. Recurrent and frozen orbits are required for these satellites.\n\n\n\n374 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nThe first programme, Landsat, dates from 1972, and its first three satellites\nhad the same orbit characteristics, namely, h = 910km and i = iHS = 99.1\n\n?.\nFrom Landsat-4, the altitude was reduced to h = 700km, i = iHS = 98.2\n\n?,\nand this orbit has since been used, not only for all the Landsat satellites,39\n\nbut also by other NASA satellites, such as EO-1 (Earth Observing) and the\nsatellites of the EOS programme (Earth Observation Satellite).\n\nThese satellites are divided into EOS Morning (EOS-AM, where AM\nstands for ante meridiem) and EOS Afternoon (EOS-PM, where PM stands\nfor post meridiem), named according to their crossing time at the equator. In\nthe first group is the satellite Terra (EOS-AM-1) [see Fig. 9.15 (upper) for the\nground track of the orbit and Figs. 9.24, 9.25, and 9.26 for images taken by its\nonboard instruments MODIS and MISR], and in the second are all the satel-\nlites of the A-Train (or Afternoon Train, see Fig. 9.22). This train of satellites\nprovides a novel synergy for atmospheric studies, since the same scene can be\nobserved simultaneously at a few minutes\u2019 interval by very different instru-\nments, e.g., spectrometer, radar, or lidar. Although launched at widely spaced\ndates, up to five satellites have flown in formation on this same orbit: Aqua\n(EOS-PM-1), CloudSat and Calipso,40 Parasol41 and Aura (EOS-Chem-1).\nThe satellite OCO (Orbiting Carbon Observatory, ESSP-5) failed to reach its\norbit, as did Glory, which was supposed to take its place between Parasol and\nAura, 2 years later. The time intervals are indicated in Fig. 9.22.\n\nThe satellite EO-1 (see Fig. 9.27) follows Landsat-7 at an interval of just\n1min (of time). In the following, we shall call this orbit, first used by Landsat-\n4, the Terra orbit. It can be defined to great accuracy by its recurrence (see\nFig. 9.15 upper).\n\nThe satellite MTI (Multispectral Thermal Imager, or P97-3) is on a lower\nSun-synchronous orbit, at h = 585km, for day and night observation, like\n\n39Launch dates: ERTS-1 (Earth Resources Technology Satellite) on 23 July 1972, renamed\nLandsat-1 on 13 January 1975; Landsat-2 on 22 January 1975; Landsat-3 on 5 March 1978;\nLandsat-4 on 16 July 1982; Landsat-5 on 1 March 1985; Landsat-6 on 5 October 1993,\nlaunch failed; Landsat-7 on 15 April 1999; Terra (EOS-AM-1) on 18 December 1999; MTI\non 12 March 2000; EO-1 and SAC-C on 21 November 2000; Aqua (EOS-PM-1) on 4 May\n2002; CloudSat and Calipso on 28 April 2006; OCO on 24 February 2009, launch failed;\nGlory on 4 February 2011, launch failed; Landsat-8 on 11 February 2013.\n\n40These two satellites, also called ESSP-4 and ESSP-3, respectively, are part of NASA\u2019s\nESSP programme (Earth System Science Pathfinder), which also includes the two satellites,\n-A and -B, of the GRACE mission (ESSP-2), for geodesy, and VCL (Vegetation Canopy\nLidar, ESSP-1, replaced by Glory), for environmental study. The satellites ESSP-5, -6, and\n-7 are also mentioned in this chapter. The US satellite ESSP-3 with French collaboration\nwas originally called Picasso-Cena (Pathfinder Instruments for Cloud and Aerosol Space-\nborne Observations\u2014Climatologie e?tendue des nuages et des ae?rosols). However, the artist\u2019s\nfamily refused to allow free use of the name and it was renamed Calipso (Cloud Aerosol\nLidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation), and not Calypso, doubtless to avoid legal\nproceedings with Homer\u2019s descendants.\n\n41The French microsatellite Parasol (Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for At-\nmospheric Science coupled with Observations from a Lidar) was launched as a passenger of\nHe?lios-2A on 18 December 2004.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 375\n\nFig. 9.23 :The German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum fu?r Luft- und Raum-\n\nfahrt DLR) and the space company Astrium have recently taken an important step\n\nforward in their mission to create a three-dimensional map of the world.

The next 10 years should\nsee many US environmental missions come into being on Sun-synchronous\norbits, such as HypsIRI (Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager) at h = 624km,\nmonitoring vegetation, ASCENDS (Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions Over\nNights, Days and Seasons) at h = 450km, observing carbon dioxide levels,\nand 3D-Winds (Three-Dimensional Tropospheric Winds) observing wind pat-\nterns using Doppler lidar and flying at h = 400 km. The three CLARREO\nsatellites (Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory) will be\nin a strictly polar orbit, i.e., with i = 90.0?, at h = 750 km, unless the project\nfalls foul to budgetary restrictions.\n\nThe French programme of commercial remote-sensing has been carried\nout by the SPOT family of satellites42 (Satellites Pour l\u2019Observation de la\n\n42Launch dates: SPOT-1 on 22 February 1986; SPOT-2 on 11 January 1990; SPOT-3 on\n26 September 1993; SPOT-4 on 24 March 1998; SPOT-5 on 4 May 2002. These satellites,\ndesigned for 3 years\u2019 operation, actually did much better than that. For instance, SPOT-2\nwas still working when taken out of orbit after more than 19 years of service. SPOT-6\nwas launched on 9 September 2012; Ple?iades-1A on 17 December 2011; Ple?iades-1B on 2\nDecember 2012.\n\n\n\n376 Chapter 9.

The military also use images\nobtained by these satellites.43 Indeed, the French army have their own SPOT-\ntype satellites going under the name He?lios. The spatial resolution of SPOT\nsatellites (5m for SPOT-4, 2.5m for SPOT-5) has been further improved\n\n43In 1991, during the Gulf War (the operation known as Desert Storm), the US army used\nSPOT images, which were more practical with their 5m resolution and 60 km panoramas\nthan the much more detailed images procured by US intelligence satellites.\n\n\n\n378 Chapter 9.

Orbit and Mission\n\nconsideration is now being given to a constellation containing a very large\nnumber of satellites, like the e-Corce project (e-Constellation d\u2019observation\nre?currente cellulaire).\n\nThe planned French\u2013Israelian satellite VEN?S (Vegetation and Environ-\nment monitoring a New Micro-Satellite) will be Sun-synchronous, at altitude\nh = 720 km.\n\nThe German programme RapidEye45 comprises a constellation of five\nsatellites, RapidEye-1 to -5, with h = 600km, i = iHS, and a resolution\nof 6.5m. The ESA\u2013German TerraSAR mission46 comprises two satellites\nequipped with synthetic aperture radar (SAR). These are TerraSAR-X (in\nthe X band), h = 505 km, and Terra-SAR-L (in the L band), h = 620km. The\nsatellite TanDEM-X (TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement)\nis on the same orbit as TerraSAR-X (see Fig. 9.23), in order to take images of\nthe Earth in tandem.\n\nArgentina is developing its SAOCOM programme (Sate?lite Argentino de\nObservacio?n con Microondas), with the satellites SAOCOM-1A and -1B,\nrather similar to COSMO-SkyMed.\n\nThe Soviet then Russian programme began in 1979 with the series Resurs-\nF1 then -F2, using 6 tonne satellites in very low near-polar orbits, which\noperated for 14 days, then 30 days for the later version. Literally dozens were\nlaunched47 in near-polar orbit, i = 82.3?, with altitude h = 275km for Resurs-\nF1 and h = 240km for Resurs-F2. The satellites in the Resurs-O series48\n\n(resurs means \u201cresource\u201d in Russian) look more like other remote-sensing\nsatellites: they are in Sun-synchronous orbit with h = 600 km and i = 97.9?\n\nfor Resurs-O1-1 to -O1-3, and h = 820km and i = 98.8? for Resurs-O1-4.\nThe Resurs programme follows on from the Meteor-Priroda programme. The\n\n45Joint launch of RapidEye-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 on 29 August 2008. The satellites\nRapidEye-1 to -5 were subsequently attributed the Greek names Tachys (fast), Mati (eye),\nChoma (soil, terracing), Choros (space), and Trochia (orbit), respectively. Apart from mati,\nwhich is only a modern Greek word, the other names are both ancient and modern. For the\nevolving meaning of trochia, from \u201cwheel rut\u201d to \u201corbit\u201d, see the earlier note on the word\norbita.\n\n46Launch dates: TerraSAR-X on 15 June 2007; TanDEM-X on 21 June 2010. The fre-\nquency bands for radar emission are traditionally denoted by letters: L (1\u2013 2GHz), S (2\u2013\n4GHz), C (4\u20138GHz), X (8\u201312 GHz), Ku (12\u201318GHz), K (18\u201326.6GHz), Ka (26.5\u201340 GHz).\nThe wavelengths ? = c/? (? = frequency) corresponding to the centers of these bands\nare ? = 20 cm for band L and ? = 3 cm for band X. The choice of band depends on the\nphenomenon to be observed, and in particular the effect of the atmosphere on the emitted\nwave.\n\n47The first 39 are recorded as Kosmos, from Kosmos-1127 in 1979 to Kosmos-1990 in\n1989. There were 20 more under the name of Resurs-F, from Resurs-F-1 (type F1) in 1989\nto Resurs-F-20 (type F2) in 1995, followed by the modified version, Resurs-F1M-1 in 1997\nand Resurs-F1M-2 in 1999 (type F1M).\n\n48Launch dates: Resurs-O1-1 (Kosmos-1689) on 3 October 1985; Resurs-O1-2 (Kosmos-\n1939) on 20 November 1988; Resurs-O1-3 on 4 November 1994; Resurs-O1-4 on 10 July\n1998; Monitor-E on 26 August 2005; Resurs-DK-1 on 15 June 2006. The letters attached to\nthe name Resurs are F for film, O for operational, and DK for Dmitry Kozlov, the father\nof the Yantar satellites.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 381\n\nnew generation of satellites is represented by Monitor-E (E for experimental),\nh = 550 km, resolution 8m, and Resurs-DK-1, hp = 356km, ha = 585km,\ni = 69.9?, resolution 1m, modelled on the military satellites Yantar.\n\nSatellites for general environmental monitoring are large, equipped with\nradar, flying at an altitude of h ? 780km: for Canada, Radarsat-1 and -2; for\nEurope, ERS-1, -2 (European Remote Sensing Satellite) and Envisat (Envi-\nronmental Satellite).49\n\nThe European Space Agency has many projects50 in this area. The current\ntrend is no longer to build very large satellites like Envisat (8.3 tonnes, 10\ninstruments), but to favour lighter missions.\n\nIn February 2008, the ESA and the European Union signed an agreement\nto officialise the Sentinel programme, spaceborne component of the GMES\ninitiative (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security). The satellites\nare grouped into four families51 each involving several satellites.\n\nLarge remote-sensing and environmental satellites weighing several tonnes\nrequire powerful launch vehicles which may be able to offer several piggy-\nback positions for very light passenger satellites. Such satellites, with various\nmissions (although usually technological) also follow Sun-synchronous orbits\nvery close to the orbit of the main satellite. These grouped launches52 can\n\n49Launch dates: Radarsat-1 on 4 November 1995; Radarsat-2 on 14 December 2007; ERS-\n1 on 17 July 1991; ERS-2 on 21 April 1995; Envisat on 1 March 2002.\n\n50The satellite ADM (Atmospheric Dynamics Mission), renamed ADM-Aeolus, carries a\nlidar for wind study. In a more distant future, the ESA has selected three missions: the\nSun-synchronous satellites ACE+ (Atmosphere and Climate Explorer), to study climate\nchange, EGPM (European contribution to the Global Precipitation Monitoring mission),\ndesigned to study rainfall, and the constellation of three SWARM satellites for dynamical\nmeasurement of the magnetic field and its interaction with atmospheric processes (circular\norbit, i = 86.8? for all three, but at different altitudes, viz., h = 450 km for SWARM-A and\n-B, and h = 530 km for SWARM-C).\n\n51The Sentinel families are classified as follows:\n\n\u2022 Sentinel-1, to develop a family of radar satellites to monitor the oceans and land masses,\nwith Sentinel-1A, -1B, -1C.\n\n\u2022 Sentinel-2, equipped with high-resolution optics in multispectral mode, with Sentinel-2A,\n-2B, -2C.\n\n\u2022 Sentinel-3, equipped with medium resolution visible and IR optics and an altimetric\nradar, with Sentinel-3A, -3B, -3C. This mission is a direct descendant of the ERS, En-\nvisat, T/P, and Jason missions.\n\n\u2022 Sentinel-4 and -5, designed for atmospheric analysis, in GEO orbit for -4, with Sentinel-\n4A and -4B, and in LEO orbit for -5.\n\n52Here are some examples of grouped launches where the main satellite is a large Sun-\nsynchronous remote-sensing satellite. For the first three ERS-1, SPOT-3, and He?lios-2A,\nlaunched by Ariane, the passenger satellites were called ASAP (Ariane Structure for Auxil-\niary Payload). With ERS-1 (Europe): UoSAT-5 (or OSCAR-22) (GB), Orbcomm-X (USA),\nTubsat-A (Germany), SARA (France). With SPOT-3 (France): Kitsat-2 (South Korea),\nPoSAT-1 (Portugal), Stella (France), HealthSat-2 (GB), ItamSat (Italy), EyeSat-1 (USA).\nWith He?lios-2A (France): Parasol (France), Nanosat (Spain) and four French military satel-\nlites for electronic intelligence, Essaim-1 to 4. With Resurs-O1-4 (Russia): FaSat-1 (Chile),\nTMSat (Thailand), TechSat-1B (Israel), Westpac-1 (Australia), Safir-2 (Germany). With\n\n\n\n382 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nprovide an opportunity for countries with little experience in space to get\ntheir own satellite into orbit.\n\nCountries occupying a very large territory use Sun-synchronous remote-\nsensing LEO satellites. For India, in its IRS programme53 (Indian Remote\nSensing), the first satellites, IRS-1A and -1B, are on a rather high orbit, h =\n910km, while the rest, IRS-P2, -P3, -P6 (Resourcesat-1) and Resourcesat-2,\nare on a lower orbit, h = 817 km. The 2.5m resolution of the satellite Cartosat-\n1 (IRS-P5), h = 617 km, has been improved to 1m for the satellites Cartosat-2,\n-2A, and -2B, h = 630 km. The next generation Cartosat-3 will have \u201cmilitary\u201d\nresolution. The experimental satellite TES (Technology Experiment Satellite)\nwas launched into a still lower orbit, with h = 565 km. India is also developing\na radar (SAR) satellite programme with RISat-1 (Radar Imaging Satellite)\nand RISat-2, with h = 608km and h = 550km, respectively.\n\nChina is developing several environmental programmes,54 using exclu-\nsively Sun-synchronous satellites. Some of these are small, like Tan Suo-1,\n-2, and -3 (tan suo means \u201cexperimental\u201d in Chinese), h = 608 km, 703km,\nand 581km, respectively, Huan Jing-1A and -1B (huan jing means \u201cenvi-\nronment\u201d), h = 648km, and Chuang Xin-1-02 (\u201cinnovation\u201d), h = 793km.\nOthers are large satellites equipped with radar, for military as well as environ-\nmental purposes, in the Yao Gan series (RSS, Remote Sensing Satellite, yao\ngan wei xing means \u201cremote-sensing satellite\u201d, from yao meaning \u201cfar\u201d and\ngan meaning \u201cdetection\u201d). Regarding these satellites, Yao Gan-1, -2, -3, and\n-4 are around h = 640km, while Yao Gan-5 and -6 are at the lower altitude\nh = 480 km, and Yao Gan-7 and -8 go back up to h = 660 km, along with Yao\nGan-10 and -11. The three satellites Yao Gan-9A, -9B, and -9C are in a non-\nSun-synchronous orbit with h = 1,100 km, i = 63.7? for electronic intelligence\n\nMeteor-3M-1 (Russia): Badr-B (Pakistan), Maroc-Tubsat (Morocco\u2013Germany), Kompass\nand Reflektor (Russia).

The Sun-synchronous satellite Tian Hui-1 at h = 500km takes\nstereographic images with 5m resolution.\n\nChina and Brazil are working together on the CBERS programme55\n\n(China\u2013Brazil Earth Resources Satellite), also known as Zi Yuan (\u201cresources\u201d\nin Chinese), with the satellites CBERS-1 and -2, h = 774 km, and the follow-\ning (ZY-1 series). China has also launched two satellites ZY-2 and -2B (ZY-2\nseries) in lower orbits, at h = 495km and h = 476km.\n\nTaiwan has launched Rocsat-2, renamed FormoSat-2, in a novel Sun-\nsynchronous orbit, about which we shall say more later on (see Chap. 11).\n\nAustralia is planning to launch its satellite ARIES-1 (Australian Resource\nInformation and Environment Satellite).\n\nThe US private company Resource21 (21 indicates the twenty-first cen-\ntury) should launch five satellites, RS21-1 to RS21-5, at h = 700km, with a\nresolution of 10m, as a follow-on to the Landsat heritage. This project seems\nto be on hold since 2003.\n\nJapan has always attributed great importance to the environment in its\nspace projects,56 beginning with JERS-1 (Japan Earth Resource Satellite, or\nFuyo-1, where fuyo means \u201cpurple rose\u201d in Japanese), h = 568 km, then the\nthree large satellites ADEOS-1 and -2 (Advanced Earth Observing Satellite,\nalso called Midori and Midori-2, where midori means \u201cgreen\u201d), h = 797km\nand h = 803 km, and ALOS (Advanced Land Observation Satellite, or Daichi,\n\u201cEarth\u201d) h = 692km, all weighing around 4 tonnes. This programme was\nfollowed by the GCOM programme (Global Change Observing Mission),\nwhich has two parts, GCOM-W (Water) with two satellites, h = 700km,\nand GCOM-C (Carbon cycle) with two satellites, h = 798 km. The Japanese\nsatellite GCOM-W1 (Shizuku, \u201cdewdrop\u201d) has been inserted in the A-Train,\nbetween Aqua and OCO-2 (see Fig. 9.22).\n\nSatellite-based environmental studies are now very varied. Among these\nwe may mention the detection of forest fires, where onboard instruments have\na ground resolution of about 100m, as in the case of the Sun-synchronous\nGerman satellite BIRD (Bi-spectral InfraRed Detection), h = 575 km. The\nprojected Spanish satellite FuegoSat, h = 700km, i = 47.5?, will be the pre-\ncursor of a constellation of 12 satellites, FuegoFOC (Fire Observation Con-\nstellation). For surveillance of the Amazonian forest, Brazil is developing a\nproject for two satellites, SSR-1 and -2 (Sate?lite de Sensoriamento Remoto),\nin strictly equatorial orbit with h = 900km, i = 0?.\n\nTo study the polar ice caps and make precise measurements of variations\nin their thickness, a novel orbit (near-polar non-Sun-synchronous LEO) has\n\n55Launch dates: CBERS-1 (ZY-1A, Zi Yuan-1A) on 14 October 1999; CBERS-2 (ZY-\n1B, Zi Yuan-1B) on 21 October 2003; CBERS-2B on 18 September 2007; ZY-2 (Zi Yuan-2,\nDFH-50, Jian Bing-3, JB-3) on 1 September 2000; ZY-2B (Zi Yuan-2B, DFH-55, Jian Bing-\n3B, JB-3B) on 27 October 2002; ZY-2C (Zi Yuan-2C, Jian Bing-3C, JB-3C) on 6 November\n2004. The satellites ZY-2 use a CBERS platform (recorded as ZY-1 by China).\n\n56Launch dates: JERS-1 on 11 February 1992; ADEOS-1 on 27 August 1996; ADEOS-2\non 14 December 2002; ALOS on 24 January 2006; GCOM-W1 on 18 May 2012.\n\n\n\n384 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nbeen chosen for two missions,57 one American and the other European: ICESat\n(Ice, Clouds, and Land Elevation, previously EOS-LAM), h = 600km, i = 94?,\nand CryoSat (Cryosphere Satellite), h = 720 km, i = 92?. At these altitudes,\nthe Sun-synchronous inclinations would be 97.8? and 98.3?. The US has an\nambitious programme in this pressing field of investigation, with ICESat-2\non a similar orbit to ICESat and two other missions on Sun-synchronous\norbits, DESDynI (Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice)\nand SCLP (Snow and Cold Land Processes).\n\nThe British project DMC (Disaster Monitoring Constellation), with inter-\nnational cooperation, is currently underway.58 It comprises a constellation of\nSun-synchronous microsatellites with h = 686km.\n\nWe end this category of Earth-observation satellites with Triana,59 a US\nmission with an unusual orbit for this kind of mission. After a 3.5 month\njourney, the satellite will be placed in a halo orbit around the Lagrange point\nL1 of the Earth\u2013Sun system (orbit type L1LO, period 6 months). Its instru-\nments will thus have a view of the Earth which is permanently illuminated,\nbut from a very great distance (234 Earth radii, equivalent to four times the\ndistance from the Earth to the Moon). The projected pixel size (resolution) is\n8 km (1 arcsec). Due to the large dimensions of the halo orbit, it will be pos-\nsible to observe alternately the North and South Poles of the Earth, focusing\nspecifically on the stratospheric ozone. The project, dating to 1999, was first\nabandoned, then resumed60 but without success under the name DSCO (Deep\nSpace Climate Observatory) or DSCOVR. However, in 2012, it was taken up\nagain and launch is planned for 2014.\n\n9.2.5 Satellites for Remote-Sensing and Surveillance\n\nCommercial Remote-Sensing\n\nSatellites in this category have a resolution of the order of 1m in the visible\nfrequency range (and a few meters if they carry out infrared observations),\nwhich was a level reserved for military satellites until 1994.\n\nSet up in 1992, two US companies61 share the main part of the market:\n\n57Launch dates: ICESat on 13 January 2003; CryoSat on 8 October 2005, failed; CryoSat-\n2 on 8 April 2010.\n\n58Launch dates: AlSat-1 (Algeria) on 28 November 2002; BilSat-1 (Turkey), NigeriaSat-\n1 (Nigeria) and BNSCSat (or UK-DMC) (GB) launched together on 27 September 2003;\nBeijing-1 (China) on 25 October 2005; UK-DMC2 (GB) and Deimos-1 (Spain) on 25 July\n2009; AlSat-2A (Algeria) on 12 July 2010 (launched with Cartosat-2B).\n\n59Rodrigo Triana was the first person among the sailors aboard Christopher Columbus\u2019\ncaravels to see the New World, in 1492.\n\n60The project was supported by Al Gore while he was Vice President to Bill Clinton.\nHowever, when George W. Bush arrived on the scene, it was promptly shelved. And the\nattribution of the Nobel Peace Prize jointly to Al Gore and GIEC in 2007 was unable to\ngive further impetus to this satellite project, sometimes referred to as GoreSat.\n\n61They share several common features. Their trade marks are constructed by sticking\ntwo words together without a space, and they often change name. These successive changes\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 385\n\n\u2022 GeoEye Inc., with a succession of satellites called OrbView (Orbimage),\nIkonos, and GeoEye.\n\n\u2022 DigitalGlobe, with a succession of satellites called EarlyBird/EarthWatch,\nQuickBird, and WorldView.\n\nThese satellites62 are Sun-synchronous, crossing the ascending node at 10:30.\nThe resolution63 of their images is improving all the time. The first customers\nof these companies are the American agencies NASA and NIMA, or indeed\nGoogle for Google Maps.\n\nWe list the main satellites in chronological order, giving their resolution\nand altitude:\n\n\u2022 Ikonos64 (resolution 0.8m/3m), h = 680km.\n\u2022 OrbView-3 (1m/4m), h = 451 km.\n\u2022 QuickBird-2 (0.6m/2.5m), h = 443km.\n\u2022 WorldView-1 and -2 (0.5m/2m), h = 494km and h = 765km.\n\u2022 GeoEye-1 (0.4m/1.6m), h = 679km.\n\nOther countries are developing this field of accurate spaceborne cartogra-\nphy,65 including France with Ple?iades-HR (HR standing for high resolution),\nand Israel with EROS-A1 (resolution 1.9m/5m) and EROS-B (0.7m/2.8m),\nboth at altitude h = 508 km. With resolutions of the order of 2m, countries\nnew to the field of space technology are coming into their own, e.g., Thai-\nland with THEOS (Thai Earth Observing System) (resolution 2m/5m), on a\nSPOT orbit at h = 822km, and the United Arab Emirates with DubaiSat-1\n(2.5m/5m), h = 686km. With RazakSat (2.5m/5m),66 Malaysia is making\nuse of a near-equatorial orbit that is rarely exploited, with h = 685km, i = 9?,\nsometimes referred to as NEO (near-equatorial orbit).\n\nshow up in the names of their satellites. The new European company set up jointly by\nEADS and private capital has followed this fashion, since it is called InfoTerra.\n\n62Launch dates: OrbView-1 (Microlab-1) on 3 April 1995 (launched with Orbcomm-FM-1\nand -2, non-Sun-synchronous); EarlyBird/EarthWatch-1 on 24 December 1997; Ikonos-1 on\n27 April 1999, failed; Ikonos-2 on 24 September 1999; OrbView-4 (before OrbView-3) on\n21 September 2001, failed; QuickBird-1 on 20 November 2000, failed; QuickBird-2 on 18\nOctober 2001; OrbView-3 on 26 June 2003; WorldView-1 on 18 September 2007; GeoEye-1\non 6 September 2008; WorldView-2 on 8 October 2009.\n\n63The resolution in panchromatic mode corresponds to black and white images, and in\nmultispectral mode, to colour images, generally composed of blue, green, red, and near-\ninfrared. The resolutions are indicated in the text by two lengths in meters: B&W resolu-\ntion/colour resolution.\n\n64The satellite Ikonos-1, lost at launch, was soon replaced by Ikonos-2, launched only 5\nmonths later and renamed Ikonos to exorcise the failure of the first launch. The Greek noun\n? ?,????)??\t means \u201cimage\u201d. But why did they choose the genitive ikonos?\n\n65Launch dates: EROS-A1 on 5 December 2000; EROS-B on 25 April 2006; THEOS on\n1 October 2008; DubaiSat-1 on 29 July 2009.\n\n66The satellite MACSat (Medium-sized Aperture Camera Satellite), launched on 4 July\n2009, has been renamed Razaksat, after the Malaysian Prime Minister Abdul Razak, Bapa\nPembangunam Malaysia, \u201cthe father of Malaysian development\u201d.\n\n\n\n386 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nMilitary Remote-Sensing and Surveillance\n\nFor military applications, the main category of US surveillance satellites\n(or spy satellites, depending on one\u2019s point of view) carry the suggestive name\nKey Hole (KH). They fall into several series,67 from KH-1 in 1959 to KH-13,\ncurrently operating. For the first few series up to KH-9 in 1986, the basic\nprinciple was always the same: a camera took photos, the film was placed in a\ncapsule, and as astonishing as it may seem, the capsule was then thrown back\nto Earth. A parachute opened at an altitude of 20 km and, all being well, an\naircraft equipped with a net intercepted the prize in flight (although it could\nalso be picked up by ship in the ocean). Now that the first few series have been\ndeclassified, as they say in military circles, we may observe that the success\nrate was actually very low, with only two successful missions, Discoverer-14\nand Discoverer-18, for the 27 satellites of the series KH-1 and -2 (satellites\nDiscoverer-1 to -27). The subsequent series met with more success.\n\nConcerning series KH-11 and -12, results are transmitted via SDS mili-\ntary satellites. It is claimed that images taken by the latest satellites have a\nresolution of 15 cm. However, this raises several questions regarding the influ-\nence of atmospheric turbulence, the problem of data accumulation, and so on.\nSatellites in the series KH-13 are KH-12 satellites made undetectable to radar\nand IR sensors, the so-called stealthy satellites, and those in the series 8X will\napparently be gigantic telescope satellites called Monstersats, with centimeter\nresolution,68 but in fact little is known for certain about these satellites.\n\nMissions were very short for the first KH series, lasting only a few days,\nbut then grew longer, to reach 19 days for KH-4B and 50 days with two\ncapsules for KH-8. Orbits were generally low, with h between 200 and 400km,\nnear-polar (e.g., Discoverer-35, h = 260km, i = 82?) up to KH-3, then with\nlower inclination (e.g., KH-4A-14, or Orbis, OPS/3360, hp = 117 km, ha =\n329km, i = 70?) up to KH-6, and subsequently Sun-synchronous or very\nhigh inclination (e.g., KH-7-27, hp = 139km, ha = 375 km, i = 117\n\n?) up to\nKH-11, where missions became much longer (which can justify the use of a\nSun-synchronous orbit, as we have seen). The first eleven series involved a\ntotal of 262 satellites.\n\nFor KH-12, the satellites, at 20 tonnes, were sent up for long periods on\nSun-synchronous elliptical orbits with hp ? 150km, ha ? 950km, i = iHS ?\n98?. Launches were regularly spaced: KH-12-1 (USA-86 in 1992), KH-12-2\n(USA-116 in 1995), KH-12-3 (USA-129, NROL-2 in 1996), KH-12-4 (USA-\n\n67These series have more or less officially certified code names, which become known after\na certain time delay: Corona (KH-1 to -4), Argon (KH-5), Lanyard (KH-6), Gambit (KH-7,\n-8), Hexagon and Big Bird (KH-9), Dorian (KH-10, annul), Crystal Kennan (KH-11), Ikon\nand Improved Crystal (KH-12, also known as KH-11B). The name for the current series\nKH-13 is apparently Misty.\n\n68Resolutions given by the US Air Force, which runs the programme: Series KH-1 (begun\nin 1959) 12m; KH-2 (1960) 9m; KH-3 (1961) 7.6m; KH-4A (1963) 2.7m; KH-6 (1963) 1.8m;\nKH-8 (1966) 0.5m. For KH-11 (1976) and KH-12 (1992) 0.15m with a similar telescope to\nHubble. For KH-13 0.10m, 8X 0.05m.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 387\n\n161, NROL-14 in 2001), KH-12-5 (USA-186, NROL-20 in 2005), KH-12-6\n(USA-224, NROL-49 in 2011).\n\nFor KH-13, the series known as Misty, it seems that there have been two\nsatellites on a near-circular orbit with h ? 1,000\u20133,000 km, i ? 63?: Misty-1\n(USA-53 or AFP-731 launched by STS-36 in 1990) and Misty-2 (USA-144 or\nEIS-1 in 1999).\n\n\u201cAll weather\u201d military observation is carried out by the Lacrosse radar\nsatellites, each with a mass of 20 tonnes. They have circular orbits with\nmedium inclination: Lacrosse-1 (USA-34 or Onyx-1 launched by STS-27 in\n1988), h = 440 km, i = 57?; the four others, Lacrosse-2 (USA-69 or Onyx-2\nin 1991), Lacrosse-3 (USA-133 or Onyx-3 in 1997), Lacrosse-4 (USA-152 or\nOnyx-4 in 2000), Lacrosse-5 (USA-182 or Onyx-5 in 2005), h ? 680 km with\ninclinations alternating between i = 68? and i = 57?.\n\nThe French programme69 is based on the He?lios satellites70 on Sun-\nsynchronous orbits at h = 680km, and the German programme on the five\nSAR-Lupe radar satellites,71 with h = 487km, i = iHS (SAR stands for syn-\nthetic aperture radar and lupe means \u201cmagnifying glass\u201d in German).\n\nSoviet military surveillance was carried out by a multitude of Kosmos\nsatellites. The first, in the Zenit series, had very low altitude, h ? 150km,\nand characteristic inclinations of i = 63?, 73?, 82?. Missions lasted a few days\nand the film was recovered with the satellite. The technique of recovering\nthe capsule in flight appeared with satellites in the Yantar series (meaning\n\u201camber\u201d in Russian) in 1975. The Arkon series is the equivalent of KH-12.\nRadar observation is carried out by the Almaz series (almaz meaning \u201cdia-\nmond\u201d in Russian, derived from the Arabic al ma?s, with the same meaning),\n19 tonne satellites in low circular orbits, h = 300km, i = 72?, with Kosmos-\n1870 (Almaz-T-2 or Resurs-R-2 launched in 1987) and Almaz-1 (Almaz-T-3\nor Resurs-R-3 in 1991) and the Oblik series, the equivalent of Lacrosse.\n\nChinese military surveillance and remote-sensing satellites belong to the\nFSW-2 series (Fanhui Shi Weixing), such as FSW-2-3, launched in 1996, h =\n125km, i = 63?. They return to Earth after 2 weeks (as their name suggests:\nfan hui shi means \u201creturn\u201d and wei xing means \u201csatellite\u201d). One should also\nmention the satellites Yao Gan-5 and -6 discussed above.\n\n69Helios, ? -2\n??\t? ??, is the Sun, a (non-Olympian) god of Greek mythology. He journeys\nacross the sky during the day on a chariot drawn by four horses. Thanks to his dominating\nposition and his perceptive gaze, as piercing as a ray of light, he sees everything that\nhappens on Earth. It was by reference to these features, and with little modesty, that the\nFrench military named their reconnaissance programme. While it was very important in\narchaic times, the cult of the Sun lost its influence in classical times, and Helios was often\nassimilated with Apollo.\n\n70Launch dates: He?lios-1A : 7 July 1995; He?lios-1B : 3 December 1999; He?lios-2A : 18\nDecember 2004; He?lios-2B : 18 December 2009.\n\n71Launch dates: SAR-Lupe-1 on 19 December 2006; SAR-Lupe-2 on 2 July 2007; SAR-\nLupe-3 on 1 November 2007; SAR-Lupe-4 on 27 March 2008; SAR-Lupe-5 on 22 July 2008.\n\n\n\n388 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nJapan operates its optical or radar IGS satellites72 (Intelligence Gathering\nSatellite) on low Sun-synchronous orbits, with h = 479km, mainly to provide\nearly warning of attack by North Korea.\n\nIn parallel with the EROS programme, Israel has developed its military\nprogramme Ofeq (\u201chorizon\u201d in Hebrew), with satellites73 on highly inclined\nelliptical orbits (see Fig. 9.17): Ofeq-5 (hp = 370km, ha = 750km, i = 143.5\n\n?),\nOfeq-7 (hp = 339km, ha = 575km, i = 141.8\n\n?), Ofeq-9 (hp = 343 km, ha =\n588km, i = 141.8?).\n\nWith such inclinations, these satellites can cover latitudes below 40?. Al-\nthough there is no precise information available about this programme, we\nmay imagine two possible motivations for this kind of retrograde orbit. To be-\ngin with, a retrograde orbit increases the synodic frequency ?? of the satellite\n(with a daily frequency of ? ? 15, we have ?? ? 16 rather than ?? ? 14 for\na prograde orbit) and hence the viewing frequency. In addition, a westward\nlaunch from Israel, if it failed, would end up in the Mediterranean rather than\nin one of the neighbouring countries, a useful precaution in such a region.\n\nA roughly equivalent orbit is used by TecSAR (also called Polaris), a radar\nsatellite of the Israeli military programme with hp = 405km, ha = 580km,\ni = 41.03?. This satellite, in a prograde orbit, was launched from India.\n\n9.2.6 Oceanographic Satellites\n\nThe first oceanographic satellites had highly inclined orbits: GEOS-3 (Geo-\ndynamics Experimental Ocean Satellite), h = 847km, i = 115.0?, and SeaSat,\nh = 780 km, i = 108.1?. The latter orbit was then used to within a few\nkilometers by Geosat and GFO-1 (Geosat Follow On).\n\nThe orbit of TOPEX/Poseidon is rather high, viz., h = 1,330km, to avoid\natmospheric drag as far as possible, and has a rather high inclination, viz.,\ni = 66?, in order to overfly almost the whole expanse of the oceans.74 To avoid\nany bias due to the influence of the Sun on the tides, it was essential that the\norbit should not be Sun-synchronous. The satellites Jason-1, then Jason-2\n(or OSTM, Ocean Surface Topography Mission), were placed on exactly the\n\n72Launch dates: IGS-1A (IGS-Optical-1) and IGS-1B (IGS-Radar-1) on 28 March 2003;\nIGS-3A (IGS-Optical-2) on 11 September 2006; IGS-4V (IGS-E-Optical-3) and IGS-4B\n(IGS-Radar-2) on 24 February 2007; IGS-5A (IGS-Optical-3) on 28 November 2009; IGS-\n6A (IGS-Optical-4) on 22 September 2011; IGS-7A (IGS-Radar-3) on 12 December 2011;\nIGS-8A (IGS-Radar-4) and IGS-8B (IGS-Optical-5V) on 27 January 2013.\n\n73Launch dates: Ofeq-1 on 19 September 1988; Ofeq-2 on 3 April 1990; Ofeq-3 on 5 April\n1995; Ofeq-5 on 28 May 2002; Ofeq-7 on 10 June 2007; Ofeq-9 on 22 June 2010; TecSAR\non 21 January 2008.\n\n74Launch dates: GEOS-3 on 9 April 1975; Seasat on 28 June 1978; Geosat on 13 March\n1985 (Geosat[GM] Geodetic Mission: April-Sept. 1986; Geosat [ERM] Exact Repeat Miss.:\nNov. 1986\u2013Jan. 1990); GFO-1 on 10 February 1998; TOPEX/Poseidon on 10 August 1992;\nJason-1 on 7 December 2001; Jason-2 on 20 June 2008; SARAL on 25 February 2013.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 389\n\nsame orbit75 as TOPEX/Poseidon to ensure the continuity of the French\u2013\nUS mission, which will then be extended by Jason-3. The future US satellite\nSWOT (Surface Water and Ocean Topography), which is picking up from the\nWatER-HM project (Water Elevation Recovery and Hydrosphere Mapping),\nwill be in a lower orbit, with h = 971 km and a slightly different inclination\ni = 78?, because it will also investigate water on the continental surfaces.\n\nThese altimetry satellites, together with the two Sun-synchronous Euro-\npean ERS satellites, have carried out accurate measurements of sea levels and\ntheir evolution, with very good results.76 The orbit of the Indian\u2013French satel-\nlite SARAL (Satellite with Argos and Altika) has the same characteristics as\nthat of Envisat (but with different crossing times).\n\nThe satellites77 in the Okean series, originally Soviet, then Russian\u2013\nUkrainian, then Russian (Ukraine having opted for the Sich series), are ded-\nicated to study of the polar regions and oceans. The first satellites, Okean-\nO1-1 to -3, together with Sich-1, have altitude h ? 650km and inclination\ni = 82.5?, typical of many Meteor and hundreds of Kosmos satellites. The\nnext in the series, Okean-O1-4 and Okean-O-1, have the same altitude, but\non a Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nWhen their main mission is not altimetry, oceanographic satellites78 are\nSun-synchronous: the Japanese satellites MOS-1 and MOS-1B (Marine Ob-\nservation Satellite, also called Momo and Momo-1B, where momo means\n\u201cpeach flower\u201d), h = 908km; the Chinese Hai Yang satellites (hai yang means\n\u201cocean\u201d) HY-1A and HY-1B, h = 798km, HY-2A, h = 960 km; the Indian\nsatellites Oceansat-1 (IRS-P4) and Oceansat-2, h = 720km; the US SeaStar\n(OrbView-2), h = 700 km; the South Korean satellites Arirang-1, -2, and -3 (or\nKOMPSat-1, -2, and -3, Korea Multi-purpose Satellite)79 to study the oceans\nand land masses, h = 690 km. The Argentinian satellite SAC-D (Sate?lite de\n\n75In September 2002, Topex/Poseidon was placed on a new orbit, half-way between its\nformer paths (which had become those of Jason-1). \u201cThis tandem phase illustrates the\nscientific potential of an optimised constellation of altimetry satellites\u201d (Aviso, CLS/CNES).\nThe mission officially ended in January 2006. After the launch of Jason-2, Jason-1 was\ntransferred to the former path of T/P, while Jason-2 took the place of Jason-1.\n\n76Estimated measurement accuracy (averaged over a month): GEOS-3 25 cm; Seasat 5 cm;\nGeosat 4 cm; ERS-1 and -2 3 cm; TOPEX/Poseidon 2 cm; Jason-1 1 cm; Jason-2 1 cm.\n\n77Launch dates: Okean-O1-1 on 5 July 1988; Okean-O1-2 on 28 February 1990; Okean-\nO1-3 (usually called Okean-3) on 4 June 1991; Okean-O1-4 on 11 October 1994; Sich-1 on\n31 August 1995; Okean-O-1 (usually called Okean-O) on 17 July 1999.\n\n78Launch dates: MOS-1 on 19 February 1987; MOS-1B on 7 February 1990; SeaStar on\n1 August 1997; Oceansat-1 on 26 May 1999; HY-1A (Ocean-1 or DFH-54) on 12 May 2002\n(with FY-1D); HY-1B on 11 April 2007; HY-2A on 15 August 2011; Oceansat-1 on 26 May\n1999; Oceansat-2 on 23 September 2009; Arirang-1 (with ACRIMSAT) on 21 December\n1999; Arirang-2 on 28 July 2006; Arirang-3 on 18 May 2012; QuikScat on 20 June 1999;\nCoriolis on 6 January 2003; SAC-D on 10 June 2011.\n\n79The Koreans chose the name for their satellites in a most unusual way: Arirang is a\npopular Korean folk song which has become the unofficial national anthem.\n\n\n\n390 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nAplicaciones Cientificas), h = 651 km, carries the American Aquarius instru-\nment.80\n\nSatellites equipped with a scatterometer to study the winds over the sea\nare also Sun-synchronous, e.g., QuikScat (Quick Scaterrometer), h = 805km,\nand Coriolis81 (also called WindSat or P98-2), h = 830km. The Chinese\u2013\nFrench satellite CFOSAT (Chinese\u2013French Oceanic Satellite) plans to use a\nlower orbit, with h = 514km.\n\n9.2.7 Navigation Satellites\n\nThe first US navigation system was provided by the Transit satellites in\nstrictly polar LEO orbit. They played a very important role at the incep-\ntion of space geodesy.82 Several of these satellites were equipped with nuclear\ngenerators.83\n\nA comparable Soviet then Russian system was constructed using the Parus\n(military), Tsikada, and Nadezhda constellations of satellites in polar orbit,\nwith h ? 1,000 km and i = 83?.\n\nResults of astonishing accuracy (positioning to within a few meters) are\ncurrently obtained with MEO satellite constellations. A whole chapter of this\nbook is devoted to global satellite navigation systems, or positioning systems,\ncommonly referred to as GPS (see Chap. 14).\n\n80Aquarius was designed to fly aboard the US satellite of that name, but following a\ncooperation agreement with Argentina, the satellite became Aquarius/SAC-D, then SAC-\nD/Aquarius.\n\n81Gustave Gaspard Coriolis (1792\u20131843) was a French mathematician and engineer. In\nhis first work, Du calcul de l\u2019effet des machines (1829), he introduce the ideas of work\ndone by a force (force times displacement) and kinetic energy. In his paper Sur le principe\ndes forces vives dans le mouvement relatif des machines (1831), he examined the various\naccelerations: absolute, relative, frame, and complementary. The latter subsequently became\nknown as the Coriolis acceleration. This is today a basic feature in the study of geophysical\nfluids in motion, such as marine and atmospheric currents on the surface of the globe.\n\n82In the geodesy literature, the satellites Transit-5B-1 and -5B-2 are referred to with the\nsimplified notation VBN-1 and VBN-2.\n\n83In 1961, Transit-4A was the first satellite equipped with a nuclear generator for its\nelectricity supply, the so-called SNAP (System for Nuclear Auxiliary Power). These gen-\nerators are now referred to by the acronym RTG (radioisotope thermoelectric generator).\nOther satellites in this series were equipped with RTG: Transit-4B in 1961, Transit-5B-1,\n-5B-2, and -5B-3 in 1963, and Triad-1 in 1972. The fuel was polonium-210 for the Transit-4\nsatellites, and plutonium-238 for the Transit-5 series. In the other US series, satellites with\nRTG (plutonium-238) were OPS/4682 (or Snapshot, a pun on SNAP), Nimbus-B (failed\nat launch), Nimbus-3 in an LEO orbit, and the two satellites LES-8 and -9 in GEO orbits.\nConcerning Soviet satellites equipped with RTG, it is known that there were accidents with\nKosmos-954 and Kosmos-1402. Probes travelling far out into the Solar System are also\nequipped with nuclear generators. (Cassini is carrying 35 kg of plutonium-238, producing a\npower output of 750 W).\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 391\n\n9.2.8 Communications Satellites\n\nThe principle of communication by relay is to send a signal, e.g., telephone,\ntelevision, telecommunications, from a given point on the Earth to another\nby relaying it through a satellite which detects, amplifies, and retransmits it.\nA GEO satellite can of course do this, provided it is visible from the two points\nand in suitable conditions. For high latitudes, a group of HEO satellites can\nguarantee the link. With LEO satellites, the time for which the satellite is\nvisible is rather short and a constellation is required. The reader is referred\nto Chap. 12 for further discussion of this point.\n\nGEO Telecommunications\n\nAlmost 300 satellites are currently operating in the necessarily one-\ndimensional geostationary orbit, and most of these are for communications.84\n\nThese satellites have an average lifespan of about 12 years. Generally speak-\ning, a country or group of countries sets up its satellite at the longitude of\none of its meridians.85\n\nA country like Indonesia can use a geostationary satellite to set up a\ntelecommunications network between the hundreds of islands composing it,\nmuch more easily than using a network at ground level. Moreover, for many\n\n84There are also around 15 weather satellites, some of which are dual purpose weather and\ncommunications, not forgetting the Chinese Beidou positioning satellites (see Chap. 14).\n\n85As an example, we mention several operational satellites with their parking position\nin 2013. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, most European countries have aban-\ndoned their national satellites to join a European organisation. For instance, the Telecom\nsatellites for France or DFS-Kopernikus for Germany have been absorbed into Eutelsat.\nOnly Scandinavian countries like Norway and Sweden (owing to their remote position rel-\native to geostationary coverage) and Spain (which also targets Latin America) have held\nonto their national satellites.\n\nThe first commercial satellite in this category, Anik-1 (Canada), was launched in\n1972. We give one satellite per country or organisation, going round the geostationary\norbit in the positive direction: Rascom-QAF-14 (African org.) 2.8?E; Sirius-4 [SES-Sirius-\n4] (Sweden) 4.8?E; Eutelsat-7A (Eutelsat org.) 7.0?E; Astra-1M (Astra org.) 19.2?E;\nBadr-6 (Arabsat org.) 26.0?E; PakSat-1 (Pakistan) 38.0?E; HellasSat-2 (Greece) 39.0?E;\nTu?rksat-3A (Turkey) 41.8?E; NigComSat-1R (Nigeria) 42.5?E; Azerspace-1 (Azerbaidjan)\n46.0?E; Yamal-202 (Russia) 49.0?E; YahSat-1B (United Arab Emirates) 52.5?E; INSAT-\n3E (India) 55.0?E; Intelsat-906 (Org.

Orbit and Mission\n\ncountries, a geostationary communications satellite has an important symbolic\nvalue.86\n\nThe GEO communications satellites, which are becoming increasingly\ncommon, bigger, and more expensive,87 currently represent the largest part\nof the commercial market for space activities.\n\nGEO satellites for broadband Internet made their appearance in 2011 with\nKa-Sat (parked at 9?E) and Via-Sat-1 (at 115?W).\n\nGEO satellites are also widely used for military communications by satel-\nlites in the US series88 LES, DSCS then WGS, the TDRS system, and the\nMilstar and AEHF series. Naturally, the same can be said of satellites in the\n\n86The names chosen for these satellites serve to demonstrate this. The multiethnic country\nIndonesia, sometimes torn by internal conflict, chose the name Palapa, which means \u201cunity\u201d\nin Bahasa Indonesian, the official language. Developed countries in the New World seek the\nnames of their satellites in the Amerindian languages, perhaps as a way of finding their\nroots. Canada named its satellites Anik and Nimiq, which means \u201cbrother\u201d (for a sister)\nand \u201cunion\u201d (or \u201cbond that unites\u201d) in Inuktitut (the Inuit or Eskimo language). Argentina\nuses the Araucanian word \u201cNahuel\u201d (Araucan, Mapuche language), meaning \u201ctiger\u201d.\n\n87The two satellites Westar-6 (Western Union Communications Satellite, US) and Palapa-\nB2 (Indonesia) were launched by STS-10 (STS-41-B) on 3 February 1984, but they never\nreached the geostationary orbit. The insurers, the new owners, paid for recovery and return\nof the satellites by the shuttle flight STS-14 (STS-51-A) on 16 November 1984. China bought\nWestar-6, and turned it into AsiaSat-1, launching the satellite itself on 7 April 1990. The\nother satellite became Palapa-B2R and was launched on 13 April 1990.\n\nThe adventures of AsiaSat did not end there. The satellite AsiaSat-3, launched by a\nRussian rocket on 24 December 1997, was placed on the wrong orbit, too highly inclined (a\nGTO orbit with i = 56?). After purchasing it, the new owner (Hughes) attempted a novel\nmaneuver: the satellite was sent on two revolutions around the Moon (ra = 488,000 km,\nT = 15 day, see the Luna-3 satellite). It then returned to a geostationary orbit and became\nHGS-1 (Hughes Global Services), before being renamed PAS-22. The replacement, AsiaSat-\n3S, was inserted into the wrong orbit on 21 March 1999: hp ? 10,000 km, ha = hGS, i = 13?.\nUsing its thrust motors, it was then moved into GEO orbit.\n\nAnother example of successful recovery, although less spectacular since it was carried\nout remotely while the satellite remained in GEO orbit, concerns the satellite Palapa-C1.\nLaunched in 1996, it broke down in 1998. The manufacturer bought it back, repaired it\nunder the name of HGS-3, then resold it to Turkey under the name of Anatolia-1, having\ndisplaced it in longitude. In 2002, Turkey sold it on to Pakistan, whence it became PakSat-1,\nbut without changing place.\n\n88US military GEO satellites are:\n\n\u2022 LES (Lincoln Experimental Satellite in GEO orbit from LES-5 (launched in 1967) to\nLES-9 (in 1976).\n\n\u2022 DSCS (Defense Satellite Communications System) and WGS (Wideband Global Sat-\ncom). Launched since 1971, their parking longitudes are over the Americas. In 2003,\nlaunch of DSCS-3A3 (USA-167) and DSCS-3B6 (USA-170); in 2007, WGS-1 (USA-195);\nin 2009, WGS-2 (USA-204) and WGS-3 (USA-211); in 2012, WGS-4 (USA-233).\n\n\u2022 The TDRS satellites (Tracking and Data Relay Satellite) of the TDRSS series (TDRS\nSystem) are launched at intervals of 2\u20135 years. The first were launched by the US space\nshuttle, like TDRS-1 in 1983 (STS-6), or TDRS-2, lost in the explosion of Challenger in\n1986, up to TDRS-7 in 1995 (STS-70). TDRS-8 was launched directly in 2000, as were\nTDRS-9 and -10 in 2002.\n\n\u2022 The Milstar satellites (Military Strategic and Tactical Relay System), since 1994,\nthen the AEHF satellites (Advanced Extreme High Frequency Satellite), like AEHF-\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 393\n\nSoviet series Luch (with Kosmos-2054 and Luch-1, where luch means \u201clight\nbeam\u201d in Russian) and Raduga (up to Raduga-32, where raduga means \u201crain-\nbow\u201d), and the Chinese satellites is the series STTW (with China-26).\n\nThe first high-speed data transmission by laser was carried out in Novem-\nber 2001 between the European GEO satellite Artemis, launched just be-\nfore for this purpose, and the French LEO satellite SPOT-4. This prefigured\ntransmissions between LEO satellites via a GEO satellite as intermediary. In\nDecember 2005, the first two-way link was made between Artemis and the\nJapanese satellite OICETS (Optical Inter-orbit Communications Engineering\nTest Satellite, renamed Kirari, meaning \u201cglint, sparkle\u201d), launched in August\n2005 on an LEO orbit at h = 605km (see Fig. 9.36).\n\nHEO Telecommunications\n\nThe most commonly used HEO orbit is the one adopted by Soviet then\nRussian satellites, namely, the Molniya orbit,89 since Kosmos-41 in 1964. The\nnumber of satellites launched in these orbits is staggering: 91 for Molniya-1,\nfrom Molniya-1-01 in 1965 to Molniya-1-91 en 1998, 17 for Molniya-2, from\nMolniya-2-01 in 1971 to Molniya-2-17 in 1977, and 53 for the current series\nMolniya-3, from Molniya-3-01 in 1974 to Molniya-3-53 in 2003.\n\nThe satellites in these three series have the same orbit, to within a few tens\nof kilometers90: hp ? 500 km, ha ? 40,000km, i = 63? (critical inclination).\nThe period is 12 h (half a sidereal day): T = 717.7min, a = 26,553km, e\nbetween 0.72 and 0.75. The argument of the perigee is ? = ?90?, which means\nthat the perigee is located in the southern hemisphere, region of the Earth\nthat the satellite overflies very quickly. On the other hand, at the apogee, the\nsatellite is almost stationary for 9 h, when it is above Russia.\n\n1 (USA-214) launched in 2010, are specialised in data transmission at ever higher rates.\nThey are known to be in geostationary orbit, but apart from that, little else is known.\n\n89Molniya means \u201clightning\u201d in Russian. This refers to the fact that the satellite moves\n\u201cas fast as lightning\u201d at the perigee of its orbit. However, the main feature sought of this\nkind of satellite is to be slow at the apogee, when it overflies Russia! Now how do we say\n\u201csnail\u201d in Russian?\n\n90As an example, here are the characteristics of several Molniya orbits with the launch\ndate of the satellite, using the notation [hp/ha/i] (altitudes in kilometer, angles in de-\ngrees): Molniya-1-01 (23 April 1965) [538/39300/65.5]; Molniya-2-01 (25 November 1971)\n[516/39553/65.0]; Molniya-3-01 (21 March 1974) [250/40095/64.1]; Molniya-3-50 (8 July\n1999) [464/39889/62.8]; Molniya-3-51 (20 July 2001) [407/40831/62.9]; Molniya-3-52 (25\nOctober 2001) [615/40658/62.9]; Molniya-3-53 (19 June 2003) [637/39709/62.8].\n\n\n\n394 Chapter 9.

Time\n\ngiven in hours from 00 to 24, where 00 corresponds to the first ascending node, here\n\nat longitude 50?E. Times are given from 00 to 11 in the first revolution and from 12\nto 23 in the second. Note that 24 appears slightly after 00. Indeed, the ground track\n\nis represented over 24 h, and the satellite, with period half a sidereal day, has then\n\nmoved through slightly more than two revolutions in one mean day. The satellite is\n\neffective for Russian communications between the times denoted 01 and 10, i.e., for\n\na period of 9 h.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 395\n\nThis fundamental property is illustrated in Figs. 9.28 and 4.4 and Exam-\nples 4.1 and 4.2. The Molniya orbit and its ground track are shown in Figs. 9.29\nand 9.30.\n\nThis orbit is at the critical inclination, which fixes the position of the\nperigee (and the apogee). Furthermore, the orbit is recurrent with a cycle\nof 1 day: the ground track passes through the same point every day. With\nthree regularly spaced satellites on the same orbit, one almost achieves the\nequivalent of a geostationary satellite for the regions close to the ground track\nat apogee, each satellite being operational for 8 h. This is a judicious method\nfor solving the problem of geosynchronicity at high latitudes.\n\nThe choice of a half-day period implies that one revolution in two is unus-\nable for communications (since the apogee is once over Russia and once over\nCanada during the day). This allows a lower apogee than if the period were\ndiurnal (as for Tundra or Supertundra).\n\nThe Russian communications satellites Meridian91 (with a strong military\ncomponent) are a modernised version of Molniya-3, also on the Molniya orbit.\nThe US military satellites SDS (Space Defense System), from SDS-1 in 1976\nto SDS-7 (USA-21) in 1987, follow Molniya orbits.\n\nThe Tundra and Supertundra orbits, shown in Fig. 9.31 and discussed\nin Chap. 7, are much less widely used. The constellation SD-Radio, which\nprovides radio transmissions for American road users, is in a Tundra orbit.\nWith its three satellites Sirius-1, -2, and -3, it constitutes the only operational\nexamples of satellites in non-Molniya HEO orbit. The perigee of these two\norbits is high, well above the Van Allen radiation belts. This is not so for\nthe Molniya orbits, where satellites cross this belt on every revolution, an\nordeal for electronic equipment. The planned orbit for the Sycomores satellites\n(Syste?me de Communications avec des Mobiles Relie?s par Satellites) is also a\ngeosynchronous orbit, with a = 42,163.9km, e = 0.346 (or hp = 21,205km\nand ha = 50,366 km).\n\nThe following list of orbits concerns only those projects with some chance\nof realisation. Orbital and recurrence characteristics are given in Chap. 11.\n\nThe Loopus orbit, a = 30,000km, e = 0.6 (see Fig. 9.33), lies outside the\nradiation belts. The period of the satellite is 3/5 of a day (T = 861.526min).\n\nThe US project VIRGO (or VirtualGeo, Virtual Geostationary) uses HEO\norbits with a period of 8 h (exactly one third of a sidereal day), with a =\n20,261km, e = 0.6458, i = 63.4? (see Fig. 9.32). As for Molniya, a VIRGO\nconstellation effectively plays the role of a geostationary satellite.\n\n91Launch dates: Meridian-1 on 24 December 2006; Meridian-2 on 20 May 2009, launch\nfailed; Meridian-3 on 11 February 2010; Meridian-4 on 4 May 2011; Meridian-5 on 23\nDecember 2011, failed to reach orbit; Meridian-6 on 14 November 2012.\n\n\n\n396 Chapter 9.

With two\norbits separated by 40? and the argument of the perigee ? = 270? \u00b1 38?, we\nobtain a \u201cteardrop\u201d ground track (see Fig. 9.34).\n\nThe constellation project FLOWER uses a similar orbit to the last, with\na = 22,883.8km, e = 0.65583.\n\nThe Ellipso Borealis orbit is highly original, as we have already seen: it is\nboth Sun-synchronous and at the critical inclination. The relevant parameters\nare hp = 633km, ha = 7,605km, i = 116.6\n\n?, ? = ?90?, and it has a period\nof 3 h (T = Dsid/8) (see Fig. 10.7). The Ellipso project includes an HEO\nconstellation, Borealis, containing ten satellites in two planes, together with\na constellation, Concordia, of four (or perhaps 7) satellites in equatorial orbit\nwith h = 8,050 km and i = 0.0? (T = Jsid/5). The project has been shelved\nsince 2003.\n\nThe project FLOWER CfTM (Constellation for Telemedecine) is in the\nsame spirit as Ellipso Borealis, with parameters hp = 3,094km, ha = 9,709km,\ni = 116.6?, and a period of 4 h.\n\nMEO Telecommunications\n\nThe JOCOS orbit (Juggler Orbit Constellation, since it gives the impres-\nsion of juggling with the satellites), also known as the WEST orbit, is circular\nwith h = 13,900 km, i = 75?, and period 8 h (one third of a sidereal day).\nThe constellation project WEST (Wideband European Satellite Telecommu-\nnication) involves nine satellites on this MEO orbit, together with two GEO\nsatellites (see Fig. 9.35).\n\nOdyssey and ICO were to operate in a rarely occupied range of altitudes\nbetween MEO and LEO. The Odyssey project, abandoned in 2000, was a\nconstellation containing three planes of four satellites, h = 10,354km, i = 50?.\nThe ICO constellation (Intermediate Circular Orbit), planned to have two\nplanes of five satellites with h = 10,390 km and i = 45?, was replaced by a\ngeostationary, ICO-G1, and a ground network.\n\nLEO Telecommunications\n\nCommunications using LEO satellites always require a constellation. For\ntelephone communications, the advantage of LEO constellations is the very\nshort response time: the journey time of the signal transiting via a GEO\nsatellite is about 250ms, and this quarter of a second is sometimes considered\nto be a nuisance. However, this is not a big enough advantage to ensure the\n\n\n\n402 Chapter 9.

The following satellite constellations are\ncurrently operating (or have failed):\n\n\u2022 Orbcomm, 35 satellites (3 planes of 8), h = 810km, i = 45.0?.\n\u2022 Iridium, 88 satellites (6 planes of 11), h = 780km, i = 86.4?.\n\u2022 GlobalStar, 52 satellites (8 planes of 6), h = 1,410km, i = 52.0?.\n\u2022 GlobalStar NG, 52 satellites (8 planes of 6), h = 1,410km, i = 52.0?.\n\n92Iridium, set up by Motorola, is a telephone and data transfer system for regions not\ncovered by mobile phone networks. Faced with commercial failure, the first reaction in 2000\nwas to remove all the satellites from orbit. However, in the end, the system was taken over\nby the US Department of Defense. It is presently run by a private organisation supplying\nmilitary and institutional customers for the main part. Originally, the constellation was\nto include 77 satellites, whence the name Iridium, which is the chemical element Ir with\natomic number 77.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 405\n\nVela-4\nOrbit - ref.: Earth\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:  30.00 days\n\nEquiv. altit.  =   103052 km\n\ne = 0.100000\n\na = 109430.0 km\n\nInclination  =  40.80 \u00b0 \n\nPeriod =  6004.28 min    * rev/day = 0.24\n\nh_a = 113995 km;  h_p =92109 km;  arg. perigee:  +255.00 \u00b0\n\nLongitude / Initialisation:\n\nAsc.

As their\nname would suggest, the satellites Echo-1 and -2 were launched as passive\ntelecommunications relays. As one might imagine, the results were not very\nconvincing and this experimental system was dropped. However, these two\nsatellites were originally intended for space geodesy.\n\nWe should also mention another attempt to create a passive space com-\nmunications system. The idea was to place a ring in orbit around the Earth to\nreflect radio waves. This was the US military experiment called Westford Nee-\ndles.96 The idea was to insert a package into orbit which, once opened, would\n\n93Launch dates of the first and last satellites of each constellation:\n(a) Orbcomm constellation (Machine to Machine Communications): Orbcomm-FM-1 and\n-FM-2 on 3 April 1995, launched with Microlab-1, h = 740 km, i = 69.9?; Orbcomm-FM-3\nand -FM-4 on 10 February 1998, launched with GFO-1, h = 830 km, i = 108.0?; the other\nOrbcomm satellites were launched with i = 45.0? in clusters of 8, starting with Orbcomm-\nFM-5 to -FM-12 on 23 December 1997 and ending with Orbcomm-FM-30 to -FM-36 on 4\nDecember 1999, and supplemented by Orbcomm-FM-37 to -FM-41 on 19 June 2008.\n(b) Iridium constellation: (beginning) Iridium-4 to -8 on 5 May 1997; (end of initial pro-\ngramme) Iridium-83 to -86 on 6 November 1998; (restart) Iridium-90 to -96 on 11 February\n2002; Iridium-97 and -98 on 20 June 2002. The Iridium-Next constellation is planned for\nthe same orbit.\n(c) GlobalStar constellation: (beginning) GlobalStar-M001 to -M004 on 14 February 1998;\n(end) GlobalStar-M060 to -M064 on 8 February 2000; (supplement) GlobalStar-M065 to\n-M072 on 29 May and 20 October 2007, with h = 666 km, i = 48.45?.\n(d) GlobalStar NG constellation (New Generation) or GlobalStar-2: (beginning) GlobalStar-\nM073 to -M078 on 19 October 2010; (current) GlobalStar-M093 to -M097 on 6 February\n2013.\n(e) Teledesic constellation: (demonstration satellite) Teledesic-1 on 26 February 1998.\n\n94For Teledesic, the initial project, imagined by Microsoft in 1994, involved 840 active\nsatellites (21 planes of 40), with altitude h = 700 km. In 1997, the project was reduced to\n288 satellites (12 planes of 24), with Sun-synchronous orbits at altitude h = 1,400 km, then\npostponed indefinitely in 2002. Alcatel\u2019s SkyBridge project for 80 satellites is no longer\nunder consideration.\n\n95To begin with, between 1992 and 2001, 12 satellites were sent up (6 planes of 2),\nGonets-D1-1 to -12; then a further 36 satellites, but so far only one has been launched,\nnamely Gonets-M-1, in 2005.\n\n96First launched was the Westford-1 experiment on 21 October 1961, using the satellite\nMidas-4. This failed because the needles were not actually dispersed. The second experiment\nto be launched was Westford-2 on 9 May 1963, using the satellite Midas-7. This time the\nneedles were coated with naphthalene and were regularly dispersed. These two satellites\nwere in near-polar circular orbits at h = 3,600 km.\n\n\n\n408 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\ndistribute 480 million small copper needles (0.1mm in diameter and 18mm\nlong, corresponding to half a wavelength at the frequency of 8GHz used for\ntransmission) along its trajectory. The experiment was severely criticised by\nastronomers who saw in this a source of optical and radio pollution. In the\nend, the needles constituted neither a reflector nor a pollutant.\n\n9.2.9 Satellites for Astronomy and Astrophysics\n\nAstronomy and Astrometry\n\nIn most cases, astronomical missions are one-off experiments and the satel-\nlites are not systematically placed on the same orbits, as they might be for\nremote-sensing, for example. We shall discuss here several satellites for each\nregion of the electromagnetic spectrum used in astronomy. Most of them are\nAmerican and the remainder are mainly European.\n\nNASA launched a programme of large orbiting observatories (Great Ob-\nservatories Program), each in a specific region of the electromagnetic spec-\ntrum:\n\n\u2022 For gamma rays (? rays), the Gamma Ray Observer (GRO), renamed\nCompton.97\n\n\u2022 For X rays, the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), renamed\nChandra.98\n\n\u2022 In the visible part of the spectrum, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST),\noften simply called Hubble.99\n\n\u2022 In the infrared region, the Space InfraRed Telescope Facility (SIRTF), re-\nnamed100 the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST) or simply Spitzer, after its\nlaunch.\n\n97Arthur Holly Compton (1892\u20131962) was an American physicist. His work on X rays led\nhim to discover in 1923 the effect which now carries his name (interaction between matter\nand X rays). He also studied cosmic rays.\n\n98Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar (1910\u20131995) was an American astrophysicist of Indian\nbirth. He carried out a great many theoretical studies on the internal structure of stars,\npublishing books that are often considered to be definitive on the subjects he treated,\ne.g., stellar evolution and white dwarfs, radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres (Radiative\nTransfer, 1950), hydrodynamics, black holes (The Mathematical Theory of Black Holes,\n1983). The root \u201cchand\u201d means \u201cMoon\u201d or \u201cbright\u201d in Sanskrit.\n\n99Edwin Powell Hubble (1889\u20131953) was an American astronomer. He produced a clas-\nsification of extragalactic nebulas and, in 1928, established the law of spectral shifts, now\nknown as the Hubble law, which says that the spectral shift of a galaxy (redshift) is pro-\nportional to its distance, thus confirming the hypothesis that the Universe is expanding.\nThe constant of proportionality H0, called the Hubble constant, is not precisely known and\nmay even vary in time. It is measured in km s?1 per megaparsec. Its reciprocal, which has\nunits of time, gives the age of the Universe to within an order of magnitude: 1/H0 ? 10\nbillion years.\n100In honour of Lyman Spitzer Jr (1914\u20131957), the American astrophysicist who first\n\nsuggested placing a large telescope in space.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 409\n\nThese four missions were a considerable technological success. Each led to\nmajor scientific progress in its specific domain, see Figs. 9.39 and 9.40.\n\nConcerning more modest missions, NASA\u2019s Explorer programme is well\nunderway with three formats, depending on the budget: Medium Explorer\n(MIDEX), Small Explorer (SMEX), and University-class Explorer (UNEX).\n\nIn the following we outline this diversity of astronomical missions.\n\nCosmic Rays and Gamma Rays\n\nGamma-ray astronomy began in 1961 with Explorer-11 (also called S-15),\nhp = 480km, ha = 1,460km, i = 29\n\n?, which provided the first detection of\ngamma rays from space. This was followed by OSO-3 and OSO-7, both on the\norbit h = 550km, i = 33?, then Explorer-48 (SAS-2), h = 526km, i = 1?, not\nforgetting the Vela satellites discussed further below.\n\nIn this field of investigation, orbits are generally low and not highly in-\nclined, as for the HEAO satellites (High Energy Astrophysical Observatory),\nHEAO -1, -2 (renamed Einstein), and -3, h ? 500 km, i = 23?, 23?, and 44?,\nor the satellite HETE-2 (High Energy Transient Experiment, Explorer-79),\nh = 615 km, i = 2?.\n\nThe Compton satellite (CGRO), launched on 5 April 1991 by STS-37\nwith h = 450km, i = 28.5?, had a mass of 15 tonnes, including 7 tonnes\nof instruments. Great precautions were taken when it was deliberately de-\norbited on 3 June 2000. The US Swift satellites,101 h = 595 km, i = 20.6?\n\nand Fermi,102 h = 552km, i = 25.6?, and also the Italian satellite Agile,\nh = 538 km, i = 2.5?, have very similar orbits.\n\nThe European satellite Integral (International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics\nLaboratory), launched on 17 October 2002, is on an HEO orbit with a =\n87,699km, e = 0.8204 (or hp = 9,400 km, ha = 153,300km), i = 57\n\n? to 67?,\nand a period T = 71.8 h = 3Dsid. Figure 9.38 shows how the representation\nof the orbit changes from a classic ellipse in ? to an elegant closed curve in\nthe form of a lasso in ?T.\n\nX Rays\n\nCertain orbits are like those seen above, i.e., low, with h ? 550km, and\nwith low inclination: i = 53? for ROSAT; i = 4? for BeppoSAX (Satellite per\nAstronomia a raggi X ); i = 23? for XTE (X-ray Timing Explorer, Rossi, or\nRXTE, Explorer-69); i = 38? for HESSI (High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Im-\nager, SMEX-6, or Explorer-81), renamed RHESSI (Reuven Ramaty HESSI);\n\n101Launch dates: Swift (MIDEX-3 or Explorer-84), for detection of gamma-ray bursts\n(GRB), on 20 November 2004; GLAST (Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope), renamed\nFermi or FGRST (Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope) after the launch on 11 June 2008;\nAgile (Astro-rivelatore Gamma a Immagini Leggero) on 23 April 2007.\n102Enrico Fermi (1901\u20131954) was an Italian physicist. At the beginning of his career, he\n\ndeveloped the theory of quantum statistical mechanics, which explains the properties of\nelectrons in metals (Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics). In nuclear physics, he devised a theory of the\nweak interaction (?-decay and neutrinos). In 1939, he emigrated to the USA, where he built\nthe first atomic pile and contributed to the development of the first atomic bomb. He also\nstudied galaxies with Chandrasekhar.\n\n\n\n410 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nFig. 9.39 :View made up from two images, one from Chandra and the other from\n\nSpitzer. The large format black and white photograph was obtained by the Spitzer\n\nspace telescope in the infrared. It is completed in the center by a false colour pho-\n\ntograph from the Chandra space telescope, which observes X-ray emissions. At the\n\ncenter is the Westerlund 2 cluster, surrounded by dust clouds forming a stellar nurs-\n\nery, with the name RCW49 (20,000 light-years away in the constellation of Centau-\n\nrus, southern hemisphere). Westerlund 2 is only 2 million years old and contains\n\nvery bright and massive stars. The infrared signatures of protoplanetary disks can be\n\nidentified in this star-forming region. Owing to the obscuring dust clouds, these stars\n\ncannot be observed by optical telescopes. The sides of the square Chandra image have\n\nlength 50 light-years.

In 1999, two large satellites,\none American and the other European, used this type of orbit: Chandra (also\ncalled CXO, Chandra X-ray Observatory), launched on 23 July by STS-93 (see\nFig. 9.37 lower), with hp = 10,157 km, ha = 138,672 km, i = 29.0\n\n?, T = 63.5h,\nand XMM (ESA\u2019s X-ray Multi-Mirror Space Observatory, renamed XMM\u2013\nNewton), launched on 10 December, with hp = 7,417 km, ha = 113,678km,\ni = 38.8?, T = 47.9 h.\n\n\n\n412 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nFig. 9.41 :The NuS-\n\nTAR satellite, in\n\nlow equatorial orbit\n\n(h = 627 km, i = 6?).\nA 10m deployable\n\nmast links the optics\n\nto the detectors in\n\nthe focal plane (next\n\nto the solar panels).\n\nArtist\u2019s view. Credit:\n\nNASA.\n\nUltraviolet (UV)\n\nThese satellites use slightly inclined LEO orbits. The satellites OAO-1, -2,\n-3 (Orbiting Astronomical Observatory), launched between 1966 and 1972,\nfollowed orbits with h = 750km, i = 35?; OAO-3 was renamed Copernicus\nfor the five hundredth anniversary of the birth of the famous astronomer.\n\nLaunched in 1978, IUE (International Ultraviolet Explorer, Explorer-57)\noperated for 18 years, instead of the planned 3 years, with a geosynchronous\norbit (a = 42,166km, e = 0.2397) inclined at i = 28.6?. The US satellites\nEUVE (Extreme UV Explorer, Explorer-67), h = 515km, i = 28.4?; FUSE\n(Far UV Spectroscopic Explorer, MIDEX-0, Explorer-77), h = 760km, i =\n25.0?; GALEX (Galaxy Evolution Experiment, SMEX-7, Explorer-83), h =\n690km, i = 28.0? were launched in 1992, 1999, and 2003, respectively. The\norbit of the Spanish satellite Minisat-01, launched in 1997, h = 570km, is\nalso inclined at about 30? to the equator, since i = 151? (which is the highest\nvalue yet put to use, to our knowledge).\n\nVisible\n\nIn the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, the two largest mis-\nsions have been the European Hipparcos and the American Hubble (with ESA\nparticipation). Both have provided excellent results, despite a difficult start.\n\nThe Hipparcos satellite (High Precision Parallax Collecting Satellite), was\ndevoted to astrometry, i.e., accurate measurement of stellar positions, and\nthus named in homage to the Greek astronomer (see the note on Hippar-\nchos).103 Launched on 8 August 1989, the satellite did not reach the planned\n\n103The satellite determined the position, luminosity, and distance of 118,218 stars. The\naccuracy of the measurements (2milliarcsec) was 100 times better than ground-based mea-\nsurements of the day.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 413\n\ngeostationary orbit but instead remained in the highly eccentric transfer or-\nbit (GTO): hp = 542 km, ha = 35,840km, i = 6.7\n\n?. Rewriting the computer\nprograms and redistributing the ground receiving stations, the mission was\nnevertheless carried successfully to completion.\n\nThe Hubble observatory was correctly launched by STS-31 on 24 April\n1990. The problems began as soon as the first image came through, clearly\nshowing that the telescope was shortsighted due to an inexcusable mirror\ndefect.104 The intention had always been to carry out maintenance via the\nShuttle and this possibility was put to use primarily to correct the optics. The\nresults did indeed come up to expectations and astronomy was revolutionised\nin the process.\n\nIn contrast, Hubble\u2019s successor must be beyond reproach from the mo-\nment of launch: NGST (New Generation Space Telescope), renamed105 JWST\n(James Webb Space Telescope), should be placed at the Lagrange point L2 of\nthe Sun\u2013Earth system (see Sect. 6.12 on the Lagrange points), and it will be\nquite impossible to go out there and repair it! In addition to the visible region,\nJWST will also observe in the infrared and for this reason will be equipped\nwith cryogenic systems.\n\nThe successor to Hipparcos, named GAIA (Global Astrometric Interfer-\nometer for Astrophysics, with reference to ? ?????, ??, G\u00e6e or Gaia, the per-\nsonification of the Earth according to the Ancient Greeks) will also be placed\nthere.106 The main advantage of the halo orbit (L2LO) around the point L2\nfor stellar observation is that the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon are all located\nbehind the line of sight of the telescope. The whole of the celestial sphere can\nthen be observed as the year goes by, without blind spots. This region is also\nvery stable as regards the thermal and particle environment.\n\nThe American planned astrometry mission is SIM Lite (formerly SIM,\nSpace Interferometry Mission), on a heliocentric orbit that gradually moves\naway from the Earth, reaching a distance of some 95 million kilometers in 5\nyears.\n\n104The main mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope was manufactured by the company\nPerkin-Elmer. It was only after launch that it was realised that the work had not been\ncarried out correctly and that the telescope optics produced fuzzy images. The problem\ncame from a faulty lens alignment, and the error was one millimeter, whereas the standard\nimposed for this project was a fraction of the visible wavelength, i.e., a hundred or so\nnanometers. Today, Perkin-Elmer has a highly diversified multinational activity but it has\nclosed its department of astronomical optics.\n105In honour of James E. Webb (1906\u20131992), NASA\u2019s second administrator, who directed\n\nthe Apollo programme and was one of the instigators of the first interplanetary exploration.\n106GAIA\u2019s mission is to observe and record a billion stars with an accuracy of 10?arcsec.\n\nFor stars within 500 light-years, the distance will be known to within a few light-days.\n\n\n\n414 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nInfrared (IR)\n\nThe detection of IR radiation involves cooling the optical system and asso-\nciated instrumentation in the satellites. The satellite ceases to function once\nits reserves of cryogenic fluid have been exhausted.\n\nMany of these satellites have used Sun-synchronous orbits, such as IRAS\n(IR All-sky Survey), h = 890 km, helium-cooled, launched in 1983, WIRE\n(Wide field IR Explorer, SMEX-5, Explorer-75), h = 560km, optics cooled by\n3 kg of solid hydrogen, launched in 1999, Akari (Astro-F), h = 630km, with\n170L of liquid hydrogen for optics at 6K, launched in 2006, WISE (Wide field\nIR Survey Explorer, Explorer-92, MIDEX-6, formerly NGSS), h = 525km,\nwith a solid hydrogen supply that should last 10 months, launched in 2009.\n\nThe European satellite, ISO (Infrared Space Observatory), with American\nand Japanese participation, was equipped with a cryostat filled with super-\nfluid helium. It operated between November 1995 and May 1998, on a highly\neccentric orbit with a period of revolution of 1 day.107 Its successor Herschel108\n\n(or HSO, Herschel Space Observatory), taking over from the FIRST project\n(Far IR and Submillimeter Telescope), launched on 14 May 2009 (jointly with\nPlanck), was placed in orbit around the Lagrange point L2 for a period of 3\nyears.\n\nThe US satellite Spitzer, launched on 25 August 2003 under the name of\nSIRTF, is on a different orbit. It follows the Earth at a distance of 0.1 a.u. or\n15 million kilometers. This heliocentric orbit, known as ETHO (Earth-trailing\nheliocentric orbit), maintains the satellite in an extremely cold environment,\npropitious for technological innovation.109\n\nMicrowave\n\nThe US satellite COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer, Explorer-66) was\nlaunched in 1989 on a Sun-synchronous orbit at h = 880km, i = 99.0?,\n\n107Orbital characteristics: hp = 1,110 km, ha = 70,504 km, i = 5.1?; a = 42,185 km, e =\n0.822, Td = 1,436min = 1 sidereal day. Cryostat: 2,200 L of superfluid helium. Temperatures\nof the various components: detector 2K, optics 3\u20134K, instruments 8K.\n108William Herschel (1738\u20131822) was a British astronomer of German origins. His life\n\nattests to an unusual intellectual development, revealing an exceptionally curious nature.\nHe was led to mathematics by music, and from there moved on to astronomy. He made\nhis own telescopes and they were the best of his day. He discovered Uranus in 1781, and\nthen later, two of its moons, followed by two of the moons of Saturn. He demonstrated\nthe displacement of the Solar System through the Galaxy and gave the coordinates of the\napparent convergence point (the so-called apex) in 1783. In 1801, he discovered infrared\nradiation.\n109In contrast to IRAS and ISO, however, Spitzer was designed with an innovative \u201cwarm-\n\nlaunch\u201d cryogenic architecture. The observatory was launched at ambient temperature and\nradiatively (or passively) cooled in the deep recesses of space. Only the focal plane in-\nstruments and the liquid helium cryostat are enclosed in a vacuum shell containing liquid\nhelium. This innovative launch architecture, combined with 360L of liquid helium, yields\nan estimated mission lifetime of about 5 years. For the sake of comparison, IRAS used 520L\nof cryogen during its 10 month mission (52 L per month as compared with 6).\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 415\n\nand explored the millimeter radiation in space in order to study tempera-\nture fluctuations in the diffuse cosmological background via extremely precise\nmeasurements. (The temperature varies from 2.7249 to 2.7251K, depending\non the observed region.) This informs us about fluctuations in the matter\ndensity of the early universe.\n\nIts successor WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, MIDEX-2,\nExplorer-80), with angular resolution 0.2? compared with 7? for COBE, is\nplaced110 in an L2LO orbit.\n\nThe European satellite Planck,111 launched with Herschel, is also placed\nat the point L2. The Planck mission\n\n112 is designed to study the origins of the\nUniverse. Its instruments should map the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave\nbackground, equivalent to the radiation of a black body at 2.725K, covering\nthe whole celestial sphere with an angular resolution of the order of 5 arcsec\n(to be compared with 7? for COBE) and a temperature sensitivity of the order\nof 2\u00d7 10?6.\n\nFor the study of galactic molecular clouds, SWAS (Submillimeter Wave\nAstronomy Satellite, SMEX-3, Explorer-74), launched in 1998, is now on a\nlow prograde orbit with h = 640km, i = 69.9?.\n\nRadio\n\nThe first satellites to study radio sources were RAE-A and -B (Radio\nAstronomy Explorer, Explorer-38 and -49), launched in 1968 and 1973 on a\nhighly inclined circular orbit with h = 5,850km and i = 120.9?.\n\nThe observation of sources emitting in the radio region, i.e., wavelengths\nof the order of one meter or more, is not seriously affected by the Earth\natmosphere, and sending instruments into orbit brings little improvement on\nthis front. However, the point about putting satellites into orbit to study this\nfrequency range is to construct as long a baseline as possible for the technique\ncommonly known as VLBI (see Chap. 3).\n\n110Launched on 30 June 2001, the MAP probe made four revolutions around the Earth on\never more eccentric orbits, reaching the vicinity of the Moon a month later. Using a lunar\nswing-by, it took another 2 months to arrive at the point L2 of the Sun\u2013Earth system on 1\nOctober 2001 and go into the halo orbit. MAP was renamed WMAP (or Wilkinson MAP)\nin February 2003, in honour of David T. Wilkinson of Princeton University, a world-famous\ncosmologist and MAP team member, who died in September 2002.\n111Max Planck (1858\u20131947) was a German physicist. He studied blackbody radiation\n\nand found an expression for the blackbody spectrum as a function of temperature and\nfrequency. This problem had stumped many physicists before him. Planck solved it in 1900\nby introducing the idea of the energy quantum. The theory of these quanta then became\nthe basis for much of modern physics.\n112Two rather similar projects were originally proposed to the European Space Agency:\n\nCOBRAS (Cosmic Background Radiation Anisotropy Satellite) and SAMBA (Satellite for\nMeasurement of Background Anisotropies). They were combined into one under the title\nCOBRAS/SAMBA. However, this pleasantly exotic but heavy and supremely redundant\nappellation was abandoned in favour of the short but enlightening name of Planck.\n\n\n\n416 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nThe Japanese are very active in this field. The satellite113 Halca was\nthe first in this category. It follows an HEO orbit with hp = 569km,\nha = 21,415km, and i = 31.4\n\n? (see Fig. 9.42 upper). Its successor will be\nAstro-G (or VSOP-2), hp = 1,000 km, ha = 25,000 km, i = 31\n\n? (see Fig. 9.42\nlower). The satellite comprises a dish 9m in diameter to observe in the three\nfrequency bands 8, 22, and 43GHz. The last two of these, corresponding to\nwavelengths of 14mm and 7mm, require cryogenics.\n\nThe Russian satellite114 Spektr-R (or RadioAstron) provides an even\nlonger baseline, with hp = 33,500km, ha = 302,000 km, and i = 72.4\n\n?\n\n(a = 174,250 km, e = 0.771, T = 201h, or more than 8 days).\n\nSolar Astrophysics\n\nSolar radiation is studied across the whole range of wavelengths. The Sun\nhas been the subject of investigation since the very beginning of the Space\nAge, from 1962 to 1976, with LEO satellites at altitudes between 500 and\n600km, such as the eight observatories OSO-1 to -8 (Orbiting Solar Obser-\nvatory), i = 33?, and the three Explorers, IQSY (International Quiet Sun\nYear, Explorer-30), Solrad-9 and -10 (Solar Radiation,115 Explorer-37 and -\n44), i ? 55?, or with slightly inclined HEO orbits, like the EPE programme\n(Energetic Particle Explorer), with EPE-A, -B, -C, and -D (Explorer-12, -14,\n-15, -26). The German satellites Helios-1 and -2 are in heliocentric orbits with\nperihelion 0.309 a.u., aphelion 0.985 a.u., i = 0?, in the plane of the ecliptic,\nand T = 190 day.\n\nLaunched in 1980, the US satellite SMM (Solar Maximum Mission) was\nthe first satellite to be repaired in flight by the Shuttle STS-11 (STS-41-C),\nin 1984. It operated until 1989 on the orbit h = 405km, i = 26.5?.\n\nRecent LEO satellites116 are in Sun-synchronous orbits, like the US satel-\nlites TRACE (Transition Region and Coronal Explorer, SMEX-4, Explorer-\n73), with altitude h = 620km, ACRIMSAT (Active Cavity Radiometer Irra-\ndiance Monitor Satellite), h = 700km, or the IRIS project (Interface Region\nImaging Spectrograph, SMEX-12), h = 636km, like the Japanese satellites\nHinode (\u201csunrise\u201d, Solar-B), hp = 318 km, ha = 675 km, i = iHS = 98.3\n\n?, and\n\n113Launch date: Halca on 12 February 1997. Halca (Highly Advanced Laboratory for\nCommunication and Astronomy), also called Muses-B or VSOP (VLBI Space Observatory\nProgramme) was renamed Haruka (haruka means \u201cremote\u201d) after launch, in accordance\nwith the Japanese tradition.\n114Launched on 18 July 2011, it replaces the overambitious Russian project KRT-25 (with\n\nEuropean participation), a 25m radiotelescope, planned to follow a variable orbit. Over its\n7 year lifespan, this orbit was to become more and more eccentric: hp ? 5,000 km, ha from\n20,000 to 150,000 km, i = 63?.\n115It later transpired that the first Solrad missions, from Solrad-1 to -7B, between 1960\n\nand 1965, were primarily spy satellites (ELINT). To give the Solrad programme a more\nscientific countenance, it was also referred to as GREB (Galactic Radiation Experimental\nBackground) or GRAB (Galactic Radiation And Background).\n116Launch dates: TRACE on 1 April 1998; ACRIMSAT on 21 December 1999; Hinode on\n\n20 September 2006; Picard on 15 June 2010.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 417\n\nHalca\nOrbit - ref.: Earth\n\nRecurrence = [ 4;-41;193] 731\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:   5.00 days\n\nEquiv. altit.  =  10965.5 km\n\ne = 0.600191\n\na =17343.641 km\n\nInclination  =  33.10 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   378.51 min    * rev/day = 3.80\n\nh_a =  21375 km;  h_p =  556 km;  arg. perigee:   +90.00 \u00b0\n\nLongitude / Initialisation:\nAsc.

The Russian satel-\nlites are in prograde near-polar orbits with h = 520km, i = 82.5?, with117\n\nKoronas-I, Koronas-F (AUOS-SM-KI and -KF), and Koronas-Foton.\nWith a different inclination, we find the Japanese satellite Solar-A (or\n\nYohkoh, \u201cSun\u201d), launched in 1991, hp = 526km, ha = 795km, i = 31.3\n?, and\n\nthe US satellite SORCE (Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment), launched\nin 2003 on the orbit h = 641km, i = 40.0?.\n\nTwo large projects have inspired a collaboration between the ESA and\nNASA in this area: Ulysses and SOHO. The Ulysses probe, launched on 6\nOctober 1990 by STS-41, set off first in the direction of Jupiter, to use it for\na gravity-assist maneuver and thereby leave the plane of the ecliptic. On 1\nNovember 1994, it overflew the south pole of the Sun, and on 1 October 1995,\nthe north pole. The satellite SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory),\nlaunched on 2 December 1995, went to Lagrange point L1 to acquire a halo\norbit. As well as its considerable contribution to our understanding of the\nSun, it also discovered a great many comets.\n\nSeveral missions should use the stable Lagrange points. Japan is planning\nits L5-Mission, which should monitor the Sun in order to provide a sort of\nspace weather forecast, the aim being to improve the safety of space activities.\nThe US mission called STEREO (Solar\u2013Terrestrial Relation Observatory) in-\ntended to place its two satellites at the Lagrange points L4 and L5, with\nSTEREO-Ahead at L4 and STEREO-Behind at L5, in order to carry out\na kind of 3D observation of the Sun. Finally, this option was dropped and\nreplaced by a heliocentric orbit with periods of 365 \u00b1 20 days. Launched on\n26 October 2006, STEREO-A precedes the Earth (Ahead) with a period of\n345 day, while STEREO-B follows (Behind) with a period of 385 day.\n\nThe US satellite SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory), launched in 2010,\nfollows a geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of i = 28.5? and with\nground track crossover at longitude ?S = 110\n\n?E.\nTwo further solar missions in the pipeline, Solar Orbiter for the ESA and\n\nSolar Probe Plus for NASA, should be in heliocentric orbits like Ulysses.\nSolar Orbiter will have variable apsides, with rp varying from 0.23 to 0.29 a.u.\n(astronomical units) and ra varying from 0.75 to 1.20 a.u., and with inclination\n(relative to the ecliptic) i = 25? going to i = 34? at the end of the mission,\nfollowing several Venus flybys. Solar Probe Plus (also written Solar Probe +),\nfollowing 7 Venus flybys between 2015 and 2021, will come very close to the\n\n117Launch dates: Koronas-I on 2 March 1994; Koronas-F on 13 July 2001; Koronas-Foton\non 30 January 2009. The letters I and F stand for Izmiran and Firas, the names of those who\nfirst conceived of these projects. Koronas-Foton is also called CORONAS-Photon (Complex\nOrbital Observations Near-Earth of Activity of the Sun), with the obvious allusion to the\nsolar corona.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 419\n\nSun, with rp varying from 0.16 a.u. or 35RS (solar radii) to 0.04 a.u. or 9.5RS.\nAt this point, it will be moving at 200km/s (or 725,000km/h) and its surface\ntemperature will be 2000?C.\n\nStellar Seismology and the Search for Exoplanets\n\nTwo satellites,118 each carrying a small telescope, have been designed to\nstudy the seismology of stars. The Canadian satellite MOST (Microvariability\nand Oscillations of Stars, jokingly nicknamed the Humble Space Telescope by\nits developers), is in a Sun-synchronous orbit with h = 625 km, iHS = 98.7\n\n?.\nThe French satellite CoRoT (Convection, Rotation et Transits plane?taires) is\nlooking for planets in orbit around stars other than the Sun by detecting the\ntransit (when the planet passes in front of its star and thereby diminishes its\nluminosity), as well as studying stellar seismology. It has a circular, strictly\npolar orbit with h = 897 km (see Chap. 7).\n\nThe European project Eddington,119 which would study the internal struc-\nture of stars and seek to detect extra-solar planets, should have been placed\nat the Lagrange point L2 on an L2LO orbit. However, in November 2003,\nthe ESA postponed the mission indefinitely. Another project, a forerunner of\nEddington and since abandoned, would have sent the satellite STARS to the\nLagrange point L5 of the Earth\u2013Moon system.\n\nThe ESA has two concurrent projects with satellites at the point L2 :\nPLATO (Planetary Transits and Oscillations of stars), which is an improved\nCoRoT, and EChO (Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory), which would\nanalyse the atmospheres of transiting planets by spectroscopy (already known\nplanets).\n\nThe European mission Darwin120 will be devoted to astrobiology (also\nknown as exobiology, to remove all possible confusion with \u201castrology\u201d), but\n\n118Launch dates: MOST on 30 June 2003; CoRoT on 27 December 2006.\n119Arthur Stanley Eddington (1882\u20131944) was a British astronomer and physicist. He did\n\nmuch to promote the theory of relativity (see the note on Einstein), through the publication\nof his book Space, Time and Gravitation first published in 1920 but still being reprinted. He\nalso laid the foundations for a new discipline, stellar dynamics, with The Internal Consti-\ntution of the Stars (1926), in which he shows that a star is subject to two opposing effects:\nit tends to contract under the effect of gravity, while the release of energy tends to push it\napart.\n120Charles Darwin (1809\u20131882) was an English naturalist. From 1831 to 1836, he took\n\npart in an expedition to South America (and in particular to the Galapagos islands) and\nOceanica aboard the HMS Beagle. As a geologist and botanist, he elaborated his theory of\nevolution on the basis of notes taken and collections brought back from this expedition. He\nconcluded that the variability of the species is due to the effects of their environment and to\nsudden variations. These variations are only favoured by natural selection if they give the\nindividual organism an advantage in its struggle for survival (subsistence and reproduction).\nHis famous book The Origin of Species was published in 1859. Darwin\u2019s theory, supported\nand developed by a great many intellectuals, was attacked without scientific argument by\nthe conservative-minded and religious classes. Here was another problem of divine order!\n\n\n\n420 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nFig. 9.43 :Kepler: NASA\u2019s first mission capable of finding Earth-size and smaller\n\nplanets around other stars, by the transit method of detecting extrasolar planets.\n\nThe Kepler instrument is a specially designed 0.95-meter diameter telescope (pho-\n\ntometer). It has a very large field of view for an astronomical telescope (105 square\n\ndegrees). Artist\u2019s view. Credit (image and caption): NASA.\n\nit is a long-term project. The Darwin \u201cflotilla\u201d121 will also be in an L2LO\norbit.\n\nThe US satellite Kepler, launched on 7 March 2009, is in a heliocentric\norbit with a = 1.01319 a.u., e = 0.03188 and a period of T = 372.5 day. In\nJanuary 2013, the mission had located 2,740 candidate planets among which\naround 60 have now been confirmed as exoplanets (see Figs. 9.43 and 16.45).\n\nFor an even finer search for exoplanets, the mission TPF (Terrestrial Planet\nFinder), comprising a flotilla of satellites, is under study. Four telescopes in\norbit, grouped at a distance of about a kilometer from a central satellite,\nthereby constitute a gigantic interferometer.\n\nSpace Exploration\n\nProbes sent out to observe other planets in the Solar System or their moons\nwill be studied in Chaps. 15 and 16, together with comets and satellites in orbit\naround these celestial bodies.\n\n121The Darwin flotilla comprises six satellites in formation. They lie strictly in the same\nplane and each is equipped with a telescope in such a way as to form an infrared interferom-\neter. One master satellite, a short distance from the others, oversees the satellite positions\nand provides the link with the Earth. The aim is to detect planets orbiting other stars and\nto spy out possible signatures of life beyond our own Solar System.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 421\n\n9.2.10 Satellites for Fundamental Physics\n\nThe satellite Gravity Probe-B (GP-B), launched122 on 19 April 2004, has a\nstrictly polar LEO orbit, already mentioned in this chapter (see Fig. 9.6). The\naim of the mission is to measure, using gyroscopes, the extent to which space\nand time are distorted by the presence of the Earth, within the framework of\nthe general theory of relativity.\n\nThe mission STE-QUEST (Space-Time Explorer and Quantum Equiva-\nlence Principle Space Test), an ESA project, would investigate gravitational\nredshift predictions of general relativity, including the gravitational redshifts\nof the Earth and Sun, and carry out tests of the weak equivalence principle\nand the universal propagation of matter waves. Ultra-precise clocks would by\ncarried on an elliptical orbit by the satellite (variation of the gravitational\nfield for altitudes varying between 1,000 and 50,000km). The orbit would be\nrecurrent, overflying dedicated ground stations (Boulder, Torino and Tokyo).\nThese novel orbits are shown in Figs. 9.44 and 9.45.\n\nTwo missions are being planned to provide experimental corroboration of\nthe equivalence principle.123 The French project ?SCOPE (Micro-Satellite a?\nCompensation de tra??ne?e pour l\u2019Observation du Principe d\u2019Equivalence), or\nMicroscope, is designed to check the universality of free fall. The satellite will\nhave a circular, Sun-synchronous LEO orbit at h ? 700km. Drag effects on the\nsatellite will be compensated by electric thrusters to ensure that the two test\nmasses carried aboard undergo perfect free-fall conditions over thousands of\nkilometers (rather than just a few tens of meters, and without compensation\nfor air resistance, if one drops the objects from the leaning tower of Pisa).\nThe US satellite STEP (Satellite Test of the Equivalence Principle) will be\n\n122The inception of this mission dates back to the beginnings of the space age. In 1959,\nphysicists at Stanford university suggested this experiment and it was accepted by NASA\nin 1961. However, checking general relativity was not such an urgent matter as the race\nto the Moon, and it was put on hold. Then there came other priorities in the form of the\nplanetary missions and the Space Shuttle.\n\nThe preliminary experiment GP-A took place in June 1976. It consisted in sending\na clock (a hydrogen maser) into space in a suborbital flight at an altitude of 10,000 km.\nIt succeeded in measuring a clock difference that bore out the predictions of Einstein\u2019s\ntheory. During this time, dozens of theses were written at Stanford on this subject, but\nGP-B was still being put off! Finally, in 1995, the mission was rescheduled with a more\ndefinite timetable. Launched in 2004, the first certified results arrived in 2007, confirming\nthe theory.\n123The equivalence principle postulated by Einstein is based on the observation that all\n\nbodies, independently of their mass, have the same acceleration in a gravitational field for\nidentical initial conditions. This is the universal principle of free fall: the passive gravita-\ntional mass of a body (m = mg in the expression for the gravitational force, involving G)\nis equal to the inertial mass (m = mi in Newton\u2019s second law):\n\nF = GMmg/r\n2 , F = mia .\n\n\n\n422 Chapter 9.

Orbit and Mission\n\nmuch bigger, with cooled instruments to increase measurement accuracy.124\n\nIt will also follow a circular, Sun-synchronous LEO orbit, at h = 550km.\nThe European project GAUGE (General relativity and Unification of Gravity\nExplorer) is planned for the same type of orbit.\n\nThe joint ESA\u2013NASA project LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna)\nwill attempt to detect gravitational waves using three satellites in formation\non a heliocentric orbit.125\n\n9.2.11 Technological Satellites\n\nThis is the category of satellites whose mission it is to assist in various\nkinds of technological development. The very first satellites fit well in this\nclass. Technological satellites are used to test instruments, orbital maneuvers,\ncommunication techniques, and reentry methods. They are also used to test\nthe design of electric or ion propulsion motors.\n\nThe satellite DODGE (Department Of Defense Gravity Experiment), h =\n33,400km, i = 12?, was sent into space in 1967 to further the development of\ngeostationary satellites, although the first of these had already been launched\nsome years previously. A camera aboard this satellite took the very first colour\npictures of the Earth\u2019s disk.\n\nThe military satellite ARGOS (Advanced Research Global Observation\nSatellite, or P91-1) was launched into a Sun-synchronous LEO orbit in 1999\nto test electric propulsion systems and detect X rays.\n\nTo study the effect of radiation on various types of equipment, several small\ntechnological satellites have been placed in highly elliptical orbits. These are\nin fact the geostationary transfer orbits (GTO) of the main satellites with\nwhich they were launched (see Fig. 9.16 lower). Such GTO orbits expose the\nsatellites to an extremely testing environment, since they cross the Van Allen\nradiation belts on each revolution. With this mission, we find the British\nmicrosatellites STRV (Space Technology Research Vehicle), STRV-1A and -\n1B, launched in 1994 as passengers with Intelsat-702, and STRV-1C and -1D\nin 2000, passengers with PAS-1R (PanAmSat-1R), whose orbital elements,\ninitially those of the GTO orbit, viz., hp = 300 km, ha = 36,000km, i = 7\n\n?,\nsubsequently evolved (see Fig. 9.9).\n\nThis category also covers calibration satellites, such as Radcal, with h ?\n800km, i = 89.5?, for radar calibrations, Reflektor, launched with Meteor-\n3M-1, for laser calibrations, and the twelve nanosatellites (a few kilogram)\n\n124The relation mg/mi = 1 has been checked on Earth to an accuracy of 10\n?12. The\n\n?SCOPE experiment aims to achieve 10?14 and STEP 10?17. Research on the STEP\naccelerometers began at Stanford university as early as 1971.\n125The three satellites will be placed at the corners of an equilateral triangle with side\n\n5 million kilometers. The center of the triangle will lie in the plane of the ecliptic, on the\nsame heliocentric orbit as the Earth, but 20 days behind, i.e., 50 million kilometers away.\nThe plane of the triangle will be slightly inclined to the plane of the ecliptic. The three\nsatellites, linked by laser, will constitute a gigantic Michelson interferometer.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 425\n\nlaunched by STS-60 and -63, Oderacs-A to -F, and Oderacs-2A to -2F (Orbital\nDebris Radar Calibration Sphere), to calibrate spacecraft debris.\n\nOne type of experiment, called a tether experiment, involves connecting\nthe satellite to a secondary body once it is already in orbit, using cables of\ndifferent lengths. These cables may or may not be conducting. The first tests\nwere carried out on the manned flights Gemini-11 and -12 (with a cable of\n30m). Also worth mentioning, launched into LEO orbit between 1993 and\n1996, are the satellites SEDS-1 then -2 (Small Expendable Deployer System),\nwith a cable 20 km long, and TiPS (Tether Physics and Survivability), with\na 4 km cable. The orbit of the TiPS central satellite had the characteristics\nh = 1,022km, i = 63.4?, e = 0.000.\n\nIn the United States, the universities carry out missions with small tech-\nnological satellites, such as SNOE (Student Nitric Oxide Explorer, STEDI-1,\nExplorer-72) or TERRIERS (STEDI-2, Explorer-76). In Europe, this policy\nis mainly applied in the United Kingdom, with UoSAT (University of Sur-\nrey Satellites), and in Germany, with Tubsat (Technische Universita?t Berlin\nSatellites). These satellites, which can generally be subsumed under the head-\ning of technological satellites, are almost always placed in Sun-synchronous\norbits as passengers. The Russian remote-sensing satellites Kanopus-V-1 and\n-2 are modelled on UoSAT.\n\nIn this category, we may also include satellites with biology missions. The\nsatellite Sputnik-2 carried a female dog by the name of Laika into space. Ani-\nmals were sent in the Russian Bion satellites to study the effects of radiation.\nFor example, in 1996, two monkeys flew in Bion-11, h = 300 km, i = 63?,\nand in 2013, Bion-M1, the Zoo-spacecraft, carried a host of mice and newts,\nh = 575 km, i = 64.9?. We may also mention the US LEO satellite OFO-1\n(Orbital Frog Otolith), launched in 1970, occupied by two toads. The aim was\nto study their inner ear, seat of the vestibular organ (balance system). The\nChinese satellite Shi Jian-8 (SJ-8, DFH-68), launched in 2006, hp = 178km,\nha = 428km, i = 63.0\n\n?, was subsequently recovered with its payload of plants\nand toadstools.\n\n9.2.12 Satellites with Specific Military Missions\n\nMany programmes have been developed by the military and civilian sec-\ntors, either jointly or in parallel, with similar areas of interest, such as remote-\nsensing, surveillance, and communications. However, certain programmes are\nspecifically military, such as the detection of nuclear explosions. Here is a brief\nreview.\n\nEarly Warning\n\nThese satellites are designed to detect enemy missiles as soon as possible\nduring or after their launch. In the United States, the first programme was\nMidas (Missile Defense Alarm System), with near-polar LEO satellites, h ?\n3,000km, from Midas-3 in 1962 to Midas-12 in 1966. Satellites in the following\n\n\n\n426 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nprogramme, IMEWS (Integrated Missile Early Warning Satellites), extended\nby DSP (Defense Support Program), have been geostationary, i ? 0?, from\nIMEWS-2 in 1971 to the current DSP missions. We know only that these\nare extremely heavy satellites carrying a multitude of sensors, mainly in the\ninfrared. The last few launched were DSP-F-21 (USA-159) in 2001, DSP-F-22\n(USA-176) in 2004, and DSP-F-23 (USA-197) in 2007.\n\nThe frequently modified NMD project (National Missile Defense) is based\nin the SBIRS satellites (Space Based IR System). As soon as a missile is fired,\nit is detected by SBIRS-High (a system126 of four GEO satellites and two\nHEO satellites). The missile is then tracked by SBIRS-Low (a constellation\nof 24 satellites in six orbital planes). The first two SBIRS-Low satellites were\nlaunched together on a circular orbit with h = 1,350 km and i = 58? on\n25 September 2009, under the names of STSS-1 and -2 (Space Tracking and\nSurveillance System, USA-208 and -209). The satellite NFIRE (Near Field\nInfrared Experiment), launched in 2007, is on a low, slightly inclined orbit,\nwith hp = 255 km, ha = 464 km, i = 48.2\n\n?.\nThe Soviet programme SPRN is equivalent to IMEWS, with a fleet of\n\nGEO satellites127 from the Oko series (\u201ceye\u201d), either on a GEO orbit for\nOko-US-KMO, or on an HEO orbit of Molniya type for Oko-US-K.\n\nNuclear Surveillance\n\nIn August 1963, leaders from the USSR, the USA, and Great Britain met\nin Moscow to sign a treaty forbidding nuclear testing in the atmosphere. To\nenforce this resolution, the different world powers launched satellites that\ncould detect explosions of this kind through the gamma-ray emissions they\ngenerate.\n\nThe US satellites Vela had novel circular orbits, at very high altitudes\nh ? 110,000km, and inclinations varying between 34? and 61? (see Fig. 9.37\nupper). They were launched in pairs, in diametrically opposed directions with\nrespect to the center of the Earth, from Vela-1 and -2 in 1963 to Vela-11 and\n-12 in 1970, and remained operational until 1984. (\u201cVela\u201d means \u201clookout\u201d\nin Spanish. These satellites were also called Watchdogs or Vela Hotel.) They\nfulfilled a scientific mission that had not been planned at all at the outset: be-\ntween 1969 and 1979, the satellites Vela-9 and -10 (OPS/6909 and OPS/6911)\nand Vela-11 and -12 (OPS/7033 and OPS/7044) mapped gamma-ray sources\nin space. Following the initial surprise and consternation (who was attack-\ning whom?), it transpired that they had discovered what have since become\nknown as gamma-ray bursts (GRB).\n\n126SBIRS-GEO: SBIRS-GEO-1 (USA-230) launched on 7 May 2011; SBIRS-GEO-2 (USA-\n241) launched on 19 March 2013. SBIRS-HEO: see below, Trumpet-FO satellites.\n127GEO orbit: 11 satellites from Oko-US-KMO-1 (Kosmos-1960) in 1988 to Oko-US-KMO-\n\n11 (Kosmos-2440) in 2008. HEO (Molniya) orbit: 83 satellites (86 launched, 3 failures) from\nOko-US-K-1 (Kosmos-520) in 1972 to Oko-US-K-85 (Kosmos-2446) in 2008 and Oko-US-\nK-86 (Kosmos-2469) in 2010.\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 427\n\nDestruction of Satellites: Star Wars\n\nIt is of little interest in such a book as this to dwell upon satellite destruc-\ntion programmes, like ASAT (Air-Launched Anti-Satellite Missile), FOBS\n(Fractional Orbital Bombardment System), or what is popularly referred to\nas \u201cstar wars\u201d, i.e., the US programme SDI (Space Defense Initiative), since\nabandoned.\n\nMost space nations have protested about (successful) satellite destruction\ntests, owing to the vast amount of debris they have generated.128\n\nIntelligence\n\nSatellite interception of all kinds of electronic signal is considered to be\nof great importance by the military. This is SIGINT (signal intelligence),\ncovering ELINT (electronic intelligence), the surveillance of communications,\nand IMINT (image intelligence), photographic surveillance. The US\u2013British\n(and Commonwealth) project Echelon uses many ground stations and orbiting\nsatellites.\n\nThe US SIGINT missions began with the GREB (or GRAB) and Ferret\nseries129 (starting in 1962 with Ferret-2), on LEO orbits. The whole range of\norbit types was subsequently put to use for these activities. Each programme\nlasted for roughly a decade. At the present time, many of these satellites\nare launched on behalf of the NRO (United States National Reconnaissance\nOffice).\n\nWe note the following programmes, from the second generation in the\n1970s to the fifth in the 2000s:\n\n\u2022 LEO: SSF (Subsatellite Ferrets), NOSS (Navy Ocean Surveillance Satel-\nlite), also known as White Cloud, and NOSS-Sub-sats (satellites in forma-\ntion); satellites of the SBSS programme (Space-Based Space Surveillance),\nin Sun-synchronous orbits at h = 630km, current series130 and satellites131\n\nof the NRO.\n\n128On 11 January 2007, China carried out a test by launching a missile from the Xichang\nspace center in the province of Sichuan. The target was the defunct weather satellite FY-1C,\nat an altitude of 853 km. Thousands of pieces of debris were thereby created and continued\nin orbit for months or years, depending on their dimensions. On 21 February 2008, the\nUnited States announced that their satellite USA-193 had been successfully intercepted\nat an altitude of 310 km by a missile launched by USS Lake Erie, anchored near Hawaii.\nGiven the low altitude of this satellite, all the debris is considered to have burnt up in the\natmosphere within 90 days.\n129The word \u201cferret\u201d comes from the French \u201cfuret\u201d, which itself comes from Latin as a\n\ndiminutive of fur, furis, meaning \u201cthief\u201d. The word \u201cfurtive\u201d belongs to the group of words\nwith this root, so it is perhaps well suited to a spy satellite.\n130First launch: SBSS-1 (USA-216) on 21 September 2010. The motto of the SBSS mission,\n\nnamely, vidi, scio, patrocinor (to see, to know, to protect), is clear enough. Its objective is\nto detect any object measuring more than one meter in orbit.\n131Launch dates: NROL-66 (USA-225), also called RPP (Rapid Pathfinder Program) on\n\n6 February 2011; NROL-34 (USA-229) on 15 April 2011. NROL means NRO launch.\n\n\n\n428 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\n\u2022 HEO: Jumpseat (from 1971 to 1983), Trumpet132 (from 1994 to 1997),\nProwler133 (or Trumpet FO, currently operating).\n\n\u2022 GEO: Canyon (from 1968 to 1977), Rhyolite/Aquacade (from 1970 to\n1978), Chalet/Vortex (from 1978 to 1981), Magnum/Orion (from 1985 to\n1989); Mercury134 (from 1994 to 1998), Mentor or Advanced Orion (from\n1995 to 2003), and Intruder135 (currently operating).\n\nAmong the GEO satellites, one should distinguish those in a true geosta-\ntionary orbit from those like Canyon and Chalet/Vortex that are in geosyn-\nchronous orbits,136 but elliptical and inclined at about 8?, which makes it\neasier to locate the radars by triangulation.\n\nThere have been similar Soviet then Russian programmes, beginning in\n1970 with Kosmos-389. The Tselina programme, in LEO orbit, is the equiv-\nalent of NOSS, with i = 82.6? for the Tselina-D series and i = 71.0? for the\nmore recent Tselina-2 series.\n\n9.2.13 Manned Satellites\n\nWe give here a few dates marking out the history of manned spaceflight,\ni.e., satellites in orbit with humans aboard: Vostok-1 (\u201cOrient\u201d in Russian),\nlaunched on 12 April 1961, for the first man in orbit (one revolution) and\nApollo-11, launched on 16 July 1969, for the first steps on the Moon.\n\nThe idea of an orbital space station was first put into practice with the\nSoviet Salyut (\u201csalvation\u201d), from 1971 to 1986, followed by Mir (mir means\nboth \u201cworld\u201d and \u201cpeace\u201d in Russian), from 1986 to 2000, on a near-circular\norbit with h ? 300 km, i = 51.6?. The USA used Skylab in 1973, on an\nequivalent orbit, h ? 400km, i = 50.0?. They then began to develop the\n\n132The three satellites of the series Trumpet-1 (USA-103), Trumpet-2 (USA-112), and\nTrumpet-3 (USA-136) are in Molniya orbit with apogee over Russia. Their antennas have\ndiameters of several tens of meters, and apparently between 100 and 150m, for Trumpet-3.\nThe data are gathered by the SDS satellites, also in Molniya orbit.\n133Launch dates for the series Trumpet Follow-On: Trumpet-FO-1 (USA-184, NROL-22,\n\nSBIRS-HEO-1) on 28 June 2006; Trumpet-FO-2 (USA-200, NROL-28, SBIRS-HEO-2) on\n13 March 2008.\n134Mercury-1 (USA-105 or Jeroboam) and Mercury-2 (USA-118). This programme is some-\n\ntimes called Mercury Advanced Vortex to distinguish it from the Mercury programme of\nmanned flights.\n135The three first satellites launched were Mentor-1 (USA-110) in 1995, Mentor-2 (USA-\n\n139, NROL-6) in 1998, and Mentor-3 (USA-171, NROL-19 or Homer) in 2003. These were\nfollowed by Mentor-4 (USA-202, NROL-26), the first of the Intruder series, also called IOSA\n(Integrated Overhead SIGINT Architecture, or Intruder-1), launched on 17 January 2009.\nAccording to Aviation Week, this is the largest, the most secret, and the most expensive\nUS military satellite. Including the launch, it is said to have cost over two billion dollars.\nHowever, this record was soon beaten by the following, Mentor-5 (USA-223, NROL-32),\nlaunched on 11 November 2010.\n136Geosynchronous orbit hp = 30,500 km, ha = 41,000 km, i = 7\u20139?, for the seven Canyon\n\nsatellites, from Canyon-1 (OPS/2222) in 1968 to Canyon-7 (OPS/9751) in 1977, and the six\nVortex satellites, from Vortex-1 (OPS/9454 or Chalet-1) to Vortex-6 (USA-37 or Chalet-6).\n\n\n\n9.2 Classifying Satellites by Mission 429\n\nISS (International Space Station), from 1998, in collaboration with Russia\nand other nations. The orbit is circular, with h between 355 and 400 km and\ni = 51.6?.\n\nThe space shuttle idea is based on the possibility of a reusable spacecraft,\na satellite that becomes an aircraft in the landing stage. The five American\nSpace Shuttles were Columbia (1981\u20132003), Challenger (1983\u20131986), Discov-\nery (from 1984), Atlantis (from 1985), and Endeavour (from 1992). These\nflights are denoted by137 STS (Space Transportation System). The STS pro-\ngramme ended138 in 2011. All in all there were 135 shuttle flights, including\n133 successes and 2 failures with Challenger STS-25 (STS-51-L) and Columbia\nSTS-107.\n\nThe shuttle had two configurations: a payload of 24.4 tonnes for a low\norbit, h = 204km, i = 28.5?, and a payload of 12.5 tonnes for a higher orbit,\nh = 407km, i = 51.6?. It was the latter configuration that was used for\nrendezvous with the ISS. For maintenance of Hubble, the shuttle went into\na higher orbit. A great many satellites were placed in orbit by the shuttle.\nOnce in orbit, the satellite left the cargo bay of the shuttle and moved to\nits destination under its own power (a nearby orbit, either geostationary or\nheliocentric).\n\n9.2.14 Non-Scientific Satellites\n\nThe American organisation Celestrak, which records and classifies satel-\nlites into different categories, created a section entitled Other under the head-\ning Miscellaneous Satellites. It is interesting to cast an eye over these unclas-\nsifiable objets.\n\nFor example, the sole aim of the Celestis satellites is to send the ashes\nof certain Earthlings into orbit.139 Another remarkable oddity is the only\n\n137From the first Columbia flight on 12 April 1981, STS-1, up to the end of 1983, with STS-\n9, flights were numbered sequentially, but from 1984, their number included the fiscal year,\nthe point of launch, and a letter indicating the order for that year: STS-10 thus becomes\nSTS-41-B. Following the Challenger disaster, STS-51-L, which was the 25th shuttle flight\n(STS-25), NASA decided to return to the system of numbering by scheduling order (which\nis not necessarily the same as launch order).\n138Last flights in 2011 were Discovery (STS-133), Endeavour (STS-134), and Atlantis\n\n(STS-135).\n139Other organisations classify these as burial satellites. Without wishing to carry out\n\nunnecessary advertising for the Celestis company, we may quote the following sales in-\nformation: \u201cCelestis offers to launch a symbolic portion of the cremated remains of the\nindividuals into space\u201d. Business is clearly booming: several satellites have been placed in\norbit since 1997, not to mention a lunar impact with Lunar-01 (in fact, a capsule carried\nby Lunar Prospector) in 1998, following the same idea. There is a project to send such\nspacecraft into deep space and out of the Solar System. The first three satellites, Celestis-1\nto -3, had very different orbits, because they were launched as passengers with much bigger\nmissions. Of the following, Celestis-4 and Celestis-7, burnt up in space due to launch failure\n(grouped with OrbView-4 and QuikTOMS for the first, and Trailblazer for the second).\nSo these were certainly the first examples of satellites in which the payload was in no way\n\n\n\n430 Chapter 9. Orbit and Mission\n\nTurkmen satellite TMC, which attests to the greatness of Turkmenistan and\nits president for life by its entirely passive presence.140\n\nOther equally fascinating initiatives abound, but private financing is gen-\nerally hesitant. Let us mention two projects that have not yet been completely\nfinalised: KEO, which will remain in orbit for thousands of years (because at\nan altitude of 1,800km or indeed in a GTO orbit) and will carry some items\nwith which to remember mankind (blood, DNA, maps of the world, various\nmessages and sundry other paraphernalia); and CiS (Cross in Space), a cap-\nsule containing a cross and the bible on microfilm.\n\n9.3 Appendix: Delays in Scheduling Space\n\nMissions\n\nThere is an important issue that cannot be ignored when one considers\nspace missions, namely, rescheduling and delayed launch. Such delays gener-\nally have no other consequence than shifting the mission back in time.141 In\nsome cases, however, it can lead to a change in the orbit, as we shall see with\nEarthCARE in Chap. 11. The reasons for delays are various (launch vehicles,\ninstruments, etc.) and justifiable, but the consequences are there: missions\nnever correspond to their original schedule! Space missions provide an ex-\ncellent illustration of Hofstadter\u2019s law.142 Space agencies maintain a certain\nartful vagueness when it comes to their schedules.\n\nWhen a mission involves several satellites over a long period, governmental\norganisations have been known to make drastic changes. This is what hap-\npened in May 2010, when the US Congress decided to modify the NPOESS\nprogramme by transforming it into JPSS. Congress based its decision on a\nreport by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), which\nshows the evolution of the cost forecast from 7.00 in August 2002 to 14.95 in\nJune 2009, where the units are of course billions of dollars. This report clearly\ndescribes the planned launch date as a function of the date at which the fore-\ncast was made. The data is plotted in Fig. 9.46 for the three first satellites of\nthe programme: NPP, C1, and C2 (the names of the satellites NPOESS-1 and\n\ndeteriorated by the explosion! Note that, between 2000 and 2007, these satellites were also\ngiven the names EarthView-01, -02, -03, and -04, respectively, which might cause some\nsurprise in a remote-sensing bibliography.\n140Launched with OICETS by a Russian rocket, TMC (Turkmenistan Memorial Capsule)\n\nencloses the country\u2019s flag and a book with the title Rukhnama, a historical and philosoph-\nical work written by Saparmurat Niyazov, president of Turkmenistan for life.\n141For missions to other planets, Kepler\u2019s laws impose strict windows for launch dates.\n\nNo delay was possible for Voyager-1 and -2, . . . , Cassini, and New Horizons. In the case of\nRosetta, a delay of several months forced the ESA to change the target comet.\n142The author of Go?del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid pronounced the following\n\nlaw which carries his name: \u201cIt always takes longer than you expect, even when you take\ninto account Hofstadter\u2019s Law\u201d.\n\n\n\n9.3 Appendix: Delays in Scheduling Space Missions 431\n\n02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\n2006\n\n2007\n\n2008\n\n2009\n\n2010\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\nLaunch\n\nDecision date (year )\n\nP\nla\n\nnn\ned\n\n la\nun\n\nch\n d\n\nat\ne \n\n(y\nea\n\nr)\n\nFig. 9.46 :Planned launch\n\ndate against date decision\n\nwas taken for the three\n\nfirst satellites of the new\n\nAmerican meteorological\n\nprogramme JPSS (a joint\n\nproject of NASA, the NOAA,\n\nand the DoD): NPP, JPSS-1\n\n(denoted by C1), and JPSS-2\n\n(denoted by C2). From a\n\ndocument published by the\n\nGovernment Accountability\n\nOffice of the US Congress.\n\n-2 became JPSS-1 and -2, respectively, and are denoted by C1 and C2 in the\nreport). It is extremely rare to be able to establish such a precise time chart\non the basis of official documents.\n\nSince the GAO report, things have become still more complicated! The\nmilitary have decided to go it alone, leaving the JPSS to set up the DWSS.\nTo be continued.\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nOrbit Relative to the Sun:\n\nCrossing Times and Eclipse\n\nWe begin by studying the position of the orbital plane of an arbitrary\nsatellite relative to the direction of the Sun, focusing on the notion of cross-\ning time. We then turn more specifically to Sun-synchronous satellites for\nwhich this relative position provides the very definition of their orbit. We end\nthe chapter with a more theoretical question, calculating the angle between\nthe direction of the Sun and the plane of the orbit, and this will lead us to\nthe study of solar eclipses, when the satellite is in the Earth\u2019s shadow.\n\n10.1 Cycle with Respect to the Sun\n\n10.1.1 Crossing Time\n\nAt a given time, it is useful to know the local time on the ground track,\ni.e., the local mean time (LMT), deduced in a straightforward manner from\nthe UT once the longitude of the place is given, using (7.59). The LMT on\nthe ground track at this given time is called the crossing time or local crossing\ntime. To obtain the local apparent time (LAT), one must know the day of the\nyear to specify the equation of time ET. In all matters involving the position\nof the Sun (elevation and azimuth) relative to a local frame, this is the time\nthat should be used. The ground track of the satellite can be represented by\ngiving the crossing time. We have chosen to represent the LMT in colour with\nthe Ixion software.\n\nFor Sun-synchronous satellites like Suomi-NPP or SPOT-6, Figs. 10.2\nand 10.4 show that the crossing time depends only on the latitude. For\nthe HEO orbit of the satellite Ellipso Borealis, the stability of the crossing\n\nM.

The ascending node is denoted by N .\n\ntime also shows up very clearly in Figs. 10.6 (lower) and 10.7. For non-Sun-\nsynchronous satellites like Meteor-3-07 or Jason-2, the time difference shows\nup through a shift in the time from one revolution to the next, as can be\nseen from Figs. 10.3 and 10.5. For a low-inclination satellite such as Megha-\nTropiques, we note certain specific configurations, illustrated by Figs. 10.10\nand 10.11. If the ascending node crossing occurs at 06:00, the northern hemi-\nsphere will be viewed during the day, and the southern hemisphere during the\nnight. After a few days, the crossing time at the equator will have changed.\nAn example is given in Fig. 10.6 (upper) for the satellite Loopus in a highly\neccentric orbit.\n\n10.1.2 Calculating the Cycle CS\n\nWe consider the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, treating it as cir-\ncular, since in this calculation of the cycle, we identify LAT and LMT. In\nFig. 10.1, the center of the Sun, and of the Earth\u2019s orbit, is denoted by C,\nwhile the center of the Earth is O. The ascending node of a satellite in orbit\naround the Earth is denoted by N . The dihedral angle between the meridian\nplane of the Earth containing N and the plane containing C gives H , the\nhour angle of the ascending node. This angle is represented in Fig. 10.1 by\nH = (OC,ON ).\n\nAt time t = t0, the hour angle of N is H(t0) = H0. At another time t = t1,\nthe plane of the satellite orbit will have changed due to the phenomenon of\nnodal precession by an angle ? relative to the frame ?. The hour angle N is\nthen given by\n\nH(t1) = H1 = H0 +? ? ? ,\n\n\n\n10.1 Cycle with Respect to the Sun 435\n\nwhere ? is the angle through which the Sun\u2013Earth direction has changed as\nthe Earth moves on its orbit around the Sun, viz.,\n\n? = [CO(t0),CO(t1)] .\n\nThis angle ? is equal to the difference in ecliptic longitude l of the Sun at the\ntwo given times. Hence,\n\n?H = H1 ?H0 = ? ? ? ,\n\nwhich represents the motion of the direction of the line of nodes with the\ndirection of the Sun.\n\nSetting ?t = t1 ? t0 for the time interval, the angles can be expressed in\nterms of the angular speeds:\n\n? = ???t , ? = ??S?t ,\n\nwhence\n\n?H = (?? ? ??S)?t . (10.1)\n\nThe time interval ?tS needed for the hour angle of the ascending node to vary\nby 24 h, or one round trip, is called the cycle relative to the Sun. Hence,\n\nH(t+?tS) = H(t) [mod 2?] ,\n\nwhich implies that\n\n?tS =\n2?\n\n?? ? ??S\n.\n\nBringing in the nodal precession rate P in round trips per year as defined by\n(7.40) and (7.38), ?tS becomes\n\n?tS = ?DM\nN ?yr\n1? P .\n\nThe cycle relative to the Sun is usually given in days and we shall denote it\nby CS (C for cycle and S for Sun). Since ?tS is expressed in SI units, i.e., in\nseconds, we obtain CS from the very simple expression\n\nCS =\nNtro\nP ? 1 . (10.2)\n\nThe symbols N ?yr and Ntro are explained in Chap. 7.\nThe quantity P can be expressed in terms of the constant kh defined\n\nby (7.98). This rate P is given by\n\nP = ?kh\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)7/2\ncos i . (10.3)\n\n\n\n436 Chapter 10. Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse\n\nOne can check that, for a Sun-synchronous satellite, one does indeed have\nP = 1.\n\nIn this way we obtain the cycle relative to the Sun as a function of the\norbital characteristics, taking care to note the signs:\n\nCS = CS(a, i) = ?\nNtro\n\nkh(R/a)7/2 cos i + 1\n, (10.4)\n\nor with approximate numerical values (CS in days),\n\nCS = ?\n365.25\n\n10.11(R/a)7/2 cos i+ 1\n. (10.5)\n\nThe cycle relative to the Sun CS = CS(a, i), is a very important characteristic\nof any satellite (Figs. 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, 10.6, and 10.7).\n\n10.1.3 Cycle CS and Orbital Characteristics\n\nCycle CS as a Function of Altitude and Inclination\n\nThe cycle CS is a function of a and i. Figure 10.8 shows the variation\nCS(i) for a fixed value of the altitude, viz., h = 700km. The cycle CS(i) is\ngiven in days, with the sign indicating the direction of rotation. We have also\nplotted the nodal precession rate P (i) in rev/yr, which is a sinusoidal curve,\nand P ?1 which determines the vertical asymptote of CS(i) by its intersection\nwith the horizontal axis through the origin. This value of i corresponds to the\ninclination of the Sun-synchronous circular orbit for this altitude.\n\nFor the altitude represented here, typical of LEO satellites, we see that\nthe cycle remains in the vicinity of 2 months (CS ? ?60 day) for inclinations\nbelow 45?. When i increases, the length of the cycle also increases. Above\nthe Sun-synchronous inclination, the cycle decreases (but there are very few\nsatellites in this configuration).\n\nSpecific Cases of the Cycle CS\n\nWe note here certain specific values of the cycle CS for different orbits:\n\n\u2022 Polar Satellites. We see immediately from (10.4) or (10.5) that, if the\nsatellite is strictly polar, CS = ?365.25 day. The cycle is thus annual. One\nyear goes by before we return to the same orbital configuration relative to\nthe Sun, since the plane of the orbit does not rotate with respect to ?. The\nnegative value of CS shows that the line of nodes moves in the retrograde\ndirection relative to ?T.\n\n\u2022 Sun-Synchronous Satellites. Equation (10.2) shows that, if ?? = ??S,\nthe cycle is infinite. This happens for Sun-synchronous satellites and we\nmay indeed treat CS as infinite, since after a very great number of days,\nthe angleH will not have changed. For Sun-synchronous satellites, the hour\n\n\n\n10.1 Cycle with Respect to the Sun 437\n\nangle of the ascending node, and hence the crossing time1 of the satellite\nat the ascending node, is constant. For a given altitude, the cycle CS is\nnegative provided that i is less than the Sun-synchronous inclination given\nby (7.105). Beyond this value, CS is positive.\n\n\u2022 Shortest Cycle. The smallest value for the cycle is given by the minimum\nof |CS(a, i)|. According to (10.5), it is obtained for i = 0 and a = R, and\nthe value is\n\n|CS|min =\nNtro\nkh + 1\n\n=\n365.25\n\n11.11\n= 32.9 day . (10.6)\n\nThe cycle relative to the Sun CS can therefore never be less than 33 days.\n\nNodal Precession and Cycle CS\n\nIn order to visualise the nodal precession and bring out the significance\nof the cycle CS, let us return to the graph in Fig. 10.1 and apply it to a few\nsatellites in Example 10.2.\n\nExample 10.1 Calculate the cycle relative to the Sun for the satellites Meteor-\n3-07, Jason-2, ICESat, ERBS and UARS, and TRMM and Megha-Tropiques.\n\n? These satellites have near-circular orbits. For Meteor-3-07, we have h =\n1,194km and i = 82.56?. Using (10.5), we obtain\n\nCS = ?\n365.25\n\n10.11 (6378/7572)\n7/2\n\ncos(82.56) + 1\n= ? 365.25\n\n10.11\u00d7 0.5477\u00d7 0.1295 + 1\n\n= ? 365.25\n0.7169 + 1\n\n= ?365.25\n1.7169\n\n= ?212.73 ,\n\nwhich gives a cycle of 213 days (advance of crossing time).\nFor TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1 and -2, with h = 1,336 km and i = 66.04?,\n\nwe obtain P = ?2.107, which gives a cycle CS = ?117.47, or 117 days (ad-\nvance of crossing time).\n\nThe satellite ICESat flies at low altitude, h = 592 km, with inclination i =\n94? between the polar inclination, for which the cycle is 1 year (CS = ?365.25),\nand the Sun-synchronous inclination iHS = 97.8\n\n? at this altitude, for which\nthe cycle is infinite. The calculation gives P = 0.515, whence CS = ?752.7,\nwhich corresponds to a very long cycle, more than 2 years.\n\n1The time related to the hour angle is LAT. A Sun-synchronous satellite crosses the\nascending node at the same LMT. If there is no difference between LAT and LMT here, it\nis because we have used a simplified scenario for the Earth orbit. However, for the calculation\nof the cycle CS, this could not be otherwise: we only want to know how many days it will\nbe before the next crossing (to within a few minutes), whatever time of year it is. To treat\nan elliptical Earth orbit, we would have to specify the day we choose to begin the cycle.\n\n\n\n438 Chapter 10.

If on a given day the ascending node crossing\noccurs at noon, then 36 days later it is the descending node crossing that will\noccur at noon.\n\nFor low-inclination satellites on the equator, like TRMM and Megha-\nTropiques, the cycle is short because the factor cos i is close to unity.

The satellite Ofeq-5 with retrograde\nelliptical LEO orbit (i = 143.5?) provides one of the rare examples of prograde\nprecession. ?\n\n10.1.4 Cycle and Ascending Node Crossing Time\n\nKnowing the initial conditions, it is a simple matter to obtain the crossing\ntimes at the ascending node at an arbitrary date, provided that we also know\nthe cycle CS relative to the Sun. Indeed, since the crossing time increases or\ndecreases by 24 h every CS days, it is easy to calculate the increase or decrease\nper day. Here is an example of this calculation (Figs. 10.10 and 10.11).\n\nExample 10.3 Calculate the dates during the year 1999 for which the LMT of\nthe ascending node crossing is the same for the satellites TRMM and Resurs-\nO1-4.\n\n? In order to study the Earth\u2019s radiation budget, TRMM and Resurs-O1-\n4 were equipped with the CERES and ScaRaB instruments, respectively. A\njoint measurement campaign was organised in January and February 1999.\nThe aim was to compare the measurements obtained for the same region\nviewed by the two instruments at roughly the same times (with a leeway of\n\u00b115min). The Sun-synchronous satellite Resurs-O1-4 crosses the ascending\nnode at 22:20 LMT. The initial conditions for TRMM are given by an ascend-\ning node crossing. For tAN given in a notation indicating month day hr min\ns, we have\n\ntAN = 1999 01 21 20:43:47 (UT), ? = +5.157\n? .\n\nWe calculate the value of ?AN, the LMT crossing time, as\n\n?AN = tAN +\n?\n\n15\n= 20:43:47 + 00:20:38 = 21:04:25 .\n\nIn Example 10.1, we found P = ?6.894, which gives the cycle\n\nCS = ?\n365.25\n\n7.894\n= ?46.29 day .\n\nWe thus obtain the daily drift as\n\n1440\n\nCS\n= ? 1440\n\n46.42\n= ?31.02 min .\n\nThe difference between ?AN = 21:04 on 21 January 1999 (D = 21) and the\nchosen time of 22:20 is 76min. The passage of TRMM at the chosen time\n\n\n\n10.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 449\n\nthus occurs with a shift of ?76/31 = ?2.45 days, or 2 days earlier, i.e., on 19\nJanuary 1999 (D = 19). The ascending node crossing time around 22:20 thus\noccurs on the days Dk given by\n\nDk = 19 + k|CS| .\n\nWith D0 = 19 and k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 7, we obtain all the dates required for the\nyear 1999. If we need to know the dates of passage of TRMM at 22:20 at the\ndescending node, we merely add a half-cycle to the values of Dk, which gives\ndates shifted by 23 days with respect to the first series. ?\n\n10.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous\n\nSatellite\n\nThis section discusses Sun-synchronous Earth observation satellites in the\nbroad sense. They are all in near-circular orbits.\n\n10.2.1 Passage at a Given Latitude\n\nThe time in LMT at which a Sun-synchronous satellite crosses the ascend-\ning node is constant in time (provided that the orbit is suitably maintained, of\ncourse), because in the frame ?, the nodal precession balances the motion of\nthe Earth\u2019s axis about the Sun. This is the defining feature of Sun-synchronous\norbits, as we shall see more clearly in the next example.\n\nExample 10.4 Calculate the crossing time at two consecutive ascending nodes\nfor a Sun-synchronous satellite.\n\n? Consider the first crossing at the ascending node at longitude ?1 and time\nt = t0 in UT. Let ?1 be the corresponding LMT, so that, according to (7.61),\n\n?1 = t0 +\n?1\n15\n\n,\n\nwith time in hours and longitudes in degrees.\nThe next passage (nodal period T ) will occur at longitude ?2 and at time\n\nt = t0 + T . The corresponding LMT at the second crossing, denoted by ?2, is\ntherefore\n\n?2 = t0 + T +\n?2\n15\n\n.\n\n\n\n450 Chapter 10. Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse\n\nThe longitude ?2 is obtained simply by considering the equatorial shift given\nby (8.25):\n\n?2 = ?1 +??E = ?1 ? 15T .\n\nWe thus have\n\n?2 = t0 + T +\n?1 ? 15T\n\n15\n= t0 +\n\n?1\n15\n\n= ?1 ,\n\nwhich shows that the LMT remains constant.\nSince the mean motion is constant, the time taken to reach a given latitude\n\nfrom the equator will be the same for each revolution. We may thus say that,\nfor a Sun-synchronous satellite:\n\n\u2022 The LMT crossing time at a given latitude is constant.\n\u2022 The LMT crossing time at a given meridian depends only on the latitude.\n\n?\n\nEstablishing the Relation Between ? and ??\n\nThe relation between ? (the LMT crossing time at the meridian) and ?\n(the geocentric latitude) is found using the equations for the ground track and\ncalculating the longitude corresponding to each latitude, whereupon the time\ncan be found in LMT. However, there is a simpler way to obtain this relation\nfrom geometric considerations.\n\nConsider the Earth in the geocentric pseudo-Galilean frame ?, as shown\nin Fig. 10.12. At a given time, let A be the intersection of the meridian plane\nof the direction of the Sun with the Earth\u2019s equator. We consider the orbital\nplane of a Sun-synchronous satellite. Its ground track cuts the equator at N ,\nthe projection of the ascending node on the Earth\u2019s surface. This plane makes\nan angle i = iHS with the equatorial plane. (This is indeed i, rather than the\napparent inclination, since we are working in ?.)\n\nThe angle HAN = (OA,ON) remains constant by the Sun-synchronicity\ncondition, since HAN measures the hour angle, and hence the time in LMT of\nthe ascending node.\n\nConsider a meridian defined by a point Q on the equator. The ground\ntrack of the orbit cuts this meridian at a point P of latitude ?. The hour\nangle of P and of Q is H = (OA,OQ). We define\n\n?H = H ?HAN = (ON ,OQ) .\n\nThis angle thus measures the difference in hour angle betweenN and P (orQ).\nIn the spherical triangle PQN , with a right-angle at Q, we know the side\n\nPQ, (OQ,OP ) = ? and the angle N , representing the inclination of the or-\nbital plane. We obtain ?H from the standard relation of spherical trigonom-\netry, corresponding to the relation (ST XII), identifying PQN with CAB :\n\n\n\n10.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 451\n\nz\n\nP\n\nA\n\nQ\n\n?\nO\n\nN\n\ni\n?H\n\nFig. 10.12 : Intersect-\n\nion of the ground track\n\nof a Sun-synchronous\n\nsatellite orbit (ascend-\n\ning node N) with a\n\ngiven meridian plane,\n\ndefined by the point Q\n\non the equator.\n\nsin?H =\ntan?\n\ntan iHS\n. (10.7)\n\nNaturally, this formula is valid whether the satellite orbit is prograde or retro-\ngrade. In the prograde case, tanN and sin?H are positive. In the retrograde\ncase, as here, tanN = tan(? ? iHS) and ?H are negative.\n\nLet ?AN and ? be the local crossing times at the ascending node and P ,\nrespectively. Then,\n\n?? = ? ? ?AN =\n1\n\nK\n?H , (10.8)\n\nwhere K is a constant depending on the units, so that if time is in hours and\nangles are in degrees, then K = 15 (since 1 h corresponds to 15 degrees).\n\nWe thus have the following relations between the latitude ? and the dif-\nference in crossing times ?? :\n\n?? =\n1\n\nK\narcsin\n\n(\ntan?\n\ntan iHS\n\n)\n, (10.9)\n\nor\n\n? = arctan\n(\ntan iHS sinK??\n\n)\n.

This is a magnified view of part of the\nupper figure.\n\n\n\n10.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 453\n\nCrossing Time at an Arbitrary Latitude\n\nLet ?AN and ?DN be the crossing times at the ascending and descending\nnodes, respectively. Then,\n\n?AN = 12 + ?DN [mod 24] .\n\nFor ?? , we take the value defined by (10.9), i.e., between ?6 and +6h. We\nthereby obtain the two daily crossing times ?(A) and ?(D) in the ascending and\ndescending parts of the ground track, respectively:\n\n{\n?(A) = ?AN +?? ,\n?(D) = ?DN ??? = ?AN + 12??? .\n\n(10.11)\n\nAt a given latitude, the time difference ?(?) between two crossings, one in the\nascending part and the other in the descending part, is given by\n\n?(?) = ?(A) ? ?(D) = 12 + 2?? . (10.12)\n\nWe now give some examples of this calculation.\n\nExample 10.5 Calculate the LMT crossing time at latitude 15 ?N for a Sun-\nsynchronous satellite at altitude h = 800 km, when the crossing time at the\nascending node is 00:00 LMT.\n\n? We have seen that the inclination of the satellite is i = 98.6? for this\naltitude. Equation (10.9) yields\n\n?? =\n1\n\nK\narcsin\n\n(\ntan 15\n\ntan 98.6\n\n)\n=\n\n1\n\n15\narcsin(?0.04052) = ?2.32\n\n15\nhr = ?9.3 min .\n\nWe thus take ?? = ?9min, and inserting ?AN = 00:00 in (10.11), we obtain\n\n?(A) = ?AN +?? = 24 h 0 min ? 9 min = 23:51 ,\n\n?(D) = ?AN + 12??? = 12 h 0 min + 9 min = 12:09 .\n\nThe two passages at this latitude thus occur at 23:51 LMT and 12:09 LMT,\nas can be checked on the upper part of Fig. 10.13. ?\n\nExample 10.6 Calculate the LMT crossing time at latitude 50 ? for the Sun-\nsynchronous satellite SPOT-5, which crosses the ascending node at 22:30\nLMT.\n\n? For this satellite and latitude 50?, (10.9) gives ?? = ?42min. With (10.11)\nand ?AN = 22:30, we will thus have\n\n\n\n454 Chapter 10. Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse\n\n? = 50?N =? 21:48 and 11:12 ,\n\n? = 50?S =? 23:12 and 09:48 .\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, the daytime crossing will occur well after 10:30, in\nfact close to noon, with good solar lighting conditions. In the southern hemi-\nsphere, on the other hand, the crossing occurs rather early in the morning and\nthe lighting conditions are not so good. The choice of node, e.g., descending\nat 10:30 rather than ascending, favours observation of the high latitudes of\none hemisphere at the expense of the other. We shall return to this point. ?\n\n10.2.2 Choice of Local Time at the Ascending Node\n\nRestrictions on the Choice of Crossing Time\n\nThe local crossing time at the ascending node is determined by the aims of\nthe mission. It is chosen as a compromise between various constraints which\nwe shall number here from C1 to C5 (where C stands for constraint):\n\n(C1) To obtain the best solar lighting conditions for the regions observed.\n(C2) To take local meteorological factors into account, e.g., a certain region\n\nmay be under cloud cover every morning.\n(C3) To reduce the risks of specular reflection (this effect known as glint or\n\nSun glint due to the reflection of sunlight from water surfaces can dazzle\nthe satellite\u2019s instruments).\n\n(C4) To limit periods of solar eclipse.\n(C5) To take into account the crossing time of another Sun-synchronous\n\nsatellite carrying out the same type of mission.\n\nWe shall now discuss the various times chosen according to the type of mission.\nFigure 10.16 schematises the relationship between constraints and missions.\n\nDifferent Choices Depending on Constraints\n\nRemote-Sensing Satellites for Earth Resources\n\nAs already noted, this kind of satellite is always Sun-synchronous.2 The\nconstraints listed above as (C1) and (C3) are given priority. The local crossing\ntime at the node must be close to noon for (C1), but not too close because of\n(C3). Moreover, considering the curve ?(??), a shift away from noon yields\ngood solar lighting conditions for high latitudes. Mission designers generally\n\n2A satellite may carry instruments pertaining to different types of mission. For example,\nthe Russian satellite Resurs-O1-4 carries the Russian imaging device MSU for remote-\nsensing and the French instrument ScaRaB to study the Earth radiation budget (which can\nbe classified as meteorological). But it is the remote-sensing aspect that determined the\nchoice of crossing time.\n\n\n\n10.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 455\n\n00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24\n\n-90\n\n-60\n\n-30\n\n0\n\n30\n\n60\n\n90\nLa\n\ntit\nud\n\ne \n(d\n\neg\n)\n\nLMT crossing time (hr)\n\nFig. 10.14 :Complementarity of Terra and Aqua.

If the ascending node is at 10:30\n(?AN = 10:30), the latitudes viewed between 10:30 and 11:30 are obtained\nusing (10.10). With K = 15, the calculation for ?? = 1 gives\n\n? = arctan\n[\n(tan 98.6)(tan 15)\n\n]\n= ?61? ,\n\nwhich corresponds to latitudes lying between 0? and 61?S.

Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse\n\n13:30 is guided by the choice between northern and southern hemispheres.\nNaturally, the northern hemisphere is generally favoured, since it encom-\npasses more visible land mass than the other hemisphere, but also because\nit comprises more nations financing satellite launches.\n\nFor satellites observing Earth resources, the choice is thus between the two\nequatorial crossing times:\n\n?AN = 22:30 =? descending node 10:30 ,\n\n?AN = 13:30 =? ascending node 13:30 .\n\nThe first is called the morning crossing, and the second the afternoon crossing.\nThe graphs in Fig. 10.14 explain these choices for the NASA Earth ob-\n\nservation satellites originally called EOS-AM-1 and EOS-PM-1. They are in\ncomplementary orbits, one with the morning crossing (AM), the other with\nthe afternoon crossing (PM). They have since been renamed Terra and Aqua,\nrespectively. Between local times 10:30 and 13:30 (LMT), the most favourable\nperiod for viewing, these two satellites overfly the northern hemisphere, never\nthe southern hemisphere.\n\nThe choice between the two possibilities ?AN = 22:30 or ?AN = 13:30 is\ngenerally made in response to the constraint (C2). In this way, one avoids the\nrather systematic formation of cloud cover at particular times of the day and in\ncertain well-defined regions. The descending node has been chosen at the end\nof the morning for most Earth observation satellites. The following list shows\nthe extent to which the choice of 22:30 for the descending node dominates for\nthis kind of satellite. But if Australia were to send up a satellite to study Earth\nresources, one could be fairly certain that they would choose the ascending\nnode at 10:30!\n\n\u2022 Ascending node at 22:30: US satellites Landsat, from -1 to -8, and the fol-\nlowing, EO-1 and Terra; the French satellites SPOT, from -1 to -5, SPOT-6\n(22:00), Ple?iades-1A and -1B; the European satellites ERS-1 and -2, En-\nvisat; the Japanese satellites MOS-1 and -1B, JERS-1, ADEOS-1 and -2,\nALOS; all the Indian satellites IRS (except for the oceanographic ones),\nIRS-1A, -1B, -1C, -1D, -P2, -P3, Resourcesat-1 and -2, Cartosat-1, -2, and\n-2A, IMS-1 (21:30) and TES; the Russian satellite Resurs-O1-4, the China\u2013\nBrazil satellites CBERS, -1, -2, and -2B; the Thai satellite THEOS; the\nTurkish satellite RASAT; the Vietnamese satellite VNRED; the Taiwanese\nsatellite FormoSat-2 (21:30); the Chinese satellites HJ-1A and -1B; the Ar-\ngentinian satellite SAC-C; the Belgian\u2013European satellite PROBA; and the\nIsraeli satellite EROS-A1. To this list, one should add all the US commer-\ncial mapping satellites, Ikonos-2 (22:31), QuickBird-2 (22:27), WorldView-2\n(22:50), and GeoEye-1 (22:27) for which the time drifts slightly. The Ger-\nman commercial satellite constellation RapidEye, from -1 to -5, crosses at\na slightly different time (23:15).\n\n\n\n10.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 457\n\n\u2022 Ascending node at 13:30: Aqua and the other satellites of the A-Train (see\nFig. 9.22), CloudSat, Calipso, Parasol, Aura, GCOM-W1 (Shizuku); the\nsatellites Suomi-NPP, WorldView-1, Arirang-3; and the 4 French military\nsatellites He?lios-1A, -1B, -2A, and -2B (13:15).\n\n\u2022 Ascending node at 10:30: the Korean satellites Arirang-1 and -2; and the\nBritish satellites UK-DMC and UK-DMC2.\n\n\u2022 Ascending node at 01:30: the Israeli satellite EROS-B; and the Japanese\nsatellite Ibuki (00:50).\n\nAlthough we have grouped these satellites according to equatorial crossing\ntimes, there is a certain dispersion within each group. For example, GeoEye-1\ndoes not cross at 22:30, but rather at 22:27, and Aura does not cross at 13:30,\nbut rather at 13:46. However, as long as the satellite is maintained on orbit,\nand in particular if it is recurrent, it always crosses at the nominal time, i.e.,\n22:27 for GeoEye-1 and 13:46 for Aura, to within 1 or 2min.\n\nMeteorological Satellites\n\nFor these satellites which observe meteorological phenomena, the crossing\ntime is not critical, and it can indeed vary significantly from one satellite to the\nnext. Moreover, in most cases, these satellites are not kept at their station, the\ncrossing time being allowed to drift. This drift is quadratic in time, as shown\nby (10.21) discussed below. For the NOAA satellites, the drift, which can\nbecome quite significant, is shown in Fig. 10.15. The DMSP satellites drift in\nthe same way. For the NOAA satellites from TIROS-N and NOAA-6 onwards,\nthe constraint (C5) has been taken into account: for a given region, and with\nsolar illumination, one satellite overflies in the morning and the other in the\nafternoon.\n\nThe organisations NOAA and EUMETSAT set up the IJPS programme\n(Initial Joint Polar System) to share instruments and coordinate satellites.\nThe programme began with NOAA-18, NOAA-19, and MetOp-A, and will\ncontinue with the following NOAA and MetOp-B, then -C. The European\nsatellite operates in the middle of the morning, around 10 h (?AN = 21:30),\nthe US satellites at the beginning of the morning, around 8 h (?AN = 19:30)\nand at the beginning of the afternoon, around 14 h (?AN = 14:30).\n\nOceanographic Satellites\n\nWhen they are not specialised in altimetry, oceanographic satellites are\nSun-synchronous. If they do not carry scatterometers, the equatorial crossing\nis often chosen around noon and midnight, to satisfy constraint (C1): for\nexample, ?AN = 00:00 for Oceansat-1 and -2, ?AN = 00:20 for SeaStar.\n\nSatellites with High Energy Requirements\n\nIt is important to avoid long breaks in the power supply when satellites\ncarry a radar or other instrument with high energy requirements.

Orbits of satellites in the POES\n\nprogramme are not maintained and hence tend to drift. The time ?AN is given for\n\nthe operating period of each satellite (according to NOAA data). For NOAA-15,\n\n-16, and -17, ?AN is given by a dotted line when the satellite is a backup. The\n\nsatellite MetOp-A is maintained in orbit, with ?AN = 21:30, to within 2min (see\n\nExample 10.8).\n\npanels must be almost continuously illuminated. To achieve this, the best-\nsuited orbit has normal in the meridian plane, because eclipses are then at\ntheir shortest (see later in the chapter). This Sun-synchronous satellite is such\nthat ?AN = 06:00 or 18:00, and it is called the dawn\u2013dusk orbit. With this orbit\nthere is a clear difference between the two hemispheres: with ?AN = 06:00, the\nnorthern hemisphere is viewed at night and the southern hemisphere is viewed\nduring the day (between 06:00 and 18:00); with ?AN = 18:00, it is exactly the\nopposite.\n\nRadarsat-1 and -2 are examples, with ?AN = 18:00, as shown in Fig. 10.9.\nThe constraint (C4) is given precedence. For the four Italian satellites COSMO-\nSkyMed-1, -2, -3, and -4, which form a constellation, the crossing times are\nstrictly equal, with ?AN = 06:03, while for the German satellite TerraSAR-X,\n?AN = 18:00, and for the Indian satellite RISat-2, ?AN = 06:00.\n\nThe same is true for oceanographic satellites using a scatterometer, an\ninstrument measuring the wind speed over the sea. Examples are QuikScat\n\n\n\n10.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 459\n\nC1\nBest solar lighting\n\nconditions\n\n(a) REMOTE S.\n\n(b) METEOR.\n\n(c) OCEANOGR.\n\n(d) RADAR.\n\n(e) SOLAR OBS. 06 / 18\n\n06 / 18\n\n00 / 12\n\nam & pm\n\n22:30 13:30\n\n06 / 18(f) FUNDAM.PHYS.\n\n>>>\n\n>>>\n\n>>>\n\n>>>\n\n>>>\n\n>>>\n\nLocal meteorological\nfactors\n\nTo reduce\nSun glint\n\nTo limit\nsolar eclipse\n\nCrossing time\nof another SS sat.\n\nC2\n\nC3\n\nC4\n\nC5\n\nFig. 10.16 :Choice of ascending node crossing time for Sun-synchronous satellites\n\n(equatorial crossing).

By satisfying constraint (C4), only\nthe dawn\u2013dusk orbit can allow such continuous observation. The satellites\nTRACE (?AN = 6:00) and Picard (?AN = 6:00) are on this type of orbit.\n\nSatellites Subject to a Requirement of Limited Temperature Variation\n\nIt is of the utmost importance for satellites carrying out fundamental\nphysics experiments on the equivalence principle that temperature variations\nshould be kept to a minimum. The dawn\u2013dusk orbit satisfies constraint (C4),\nand this will be the orbit for the satellites ?SCOPE and STEP.\n\nThe satellite GOCE is in a very low orbit (h ? 250km) and should be\nsubject to as little temperature variation as possible. It is thus in a dawn\u2013\ndusk orbit with ?AN = 18:00.\n\nChoices for Other Types of Mission\n\nThe crossing time of the satellite can be determined by the physical nature\nof the phenomena to be observed. The satellite SMOS (see Fig. 9.21) measures\nground humidity. This very delicate measurement is always best when the\ntemperature gradient of the soil is at its minimum, which is the case at 6 h in\nthe morning. If one also requires a roughly constant illumination of the solar\npanels, it is clearly the dawn\u2013dusk orbit that must be chosen, as in the case\nof SMOS (?AN = 6:00). It is also the planned orbit for its US counterpart\nSMAP.\n\n\n\n460 Chapter 10. Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse\n\nThe dawn\u2013dusk orbit has been chosen for MagSat (Explorer-61, study of\nthe magnetosphere) because the perturbations produced by the Sun on the\nEarth\u2019s magnetic field, which vary from 1 h to the next, are thereby minimised\nand rendered constant (Fig. 10.16).\n\n10.2.3 Calculating the Drift in Local Crossing Time\n\nThe drift in the local crossing time is due mainly to the drift in the in-\nclination i of the orbital plane. The Lagrange equations show that di/dt = 0\nunder the effect of the geopotential. However, other gravitational perturba-\ntions due to the Sun and Moon, or non-gravitational effects, will cause this\nslight variation in i, which is very small at the beginning (a few hundredths\nof a degree per year), but eventually becomes significant.\n\nThe local crossing time ?AN at the ascending node is directly related to\nthe right ascension ? of the ascending node:\n\n?AN = 12 +\n? ??S\n\nK\n= 12 +\n\n?H\nK\n\n, (10.13)\n\nwhere ?S is the longitude of the direction of the Sun, ?AN is in hours, and ?\nand ?S are in degrees (K = 15), with ?H = ? ? ?S. The drift in the time\n?AN is then given by\n\nd?AN\ndt\n\n=\n1\n\nK\n??H . (10.14)\n\nFor a strictly maintained Sun-synchronous satellite, ??H = 0 and ?AN is there-\nfore constant.\n\nWhenever ??H = ??(a, i)? ??S is not zero, this is due to the variation of the\norbital elements a and i relative to the Sun-synchronicity constraints. Recall\nthe expression (7.5) for ??(a, i) and the Sun-synchronicity condition (7.102):\n\n??(a, i) = ?K0\n( a\nR\n\n)?7/2\ncos i ,\n\n??S = ?K0\n( a\nR\n\n)?7/2\ncos iHS .\n\nCalculating the differential of ??(a, i) and assuming that a and i remain close\nto their Sun-synchronous values, we obtain\n\nd?? = ???S\n(\n7\n\n2\n\nda\n\na\n+ tan iHS di\n\n)\n. (10.15)\n\n\n\n10.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 461\n\nIn Example 10.8, it is shown that, over a given interval of time, da/a is\nnegligible compared with di. The last relation thus gives\n\nd??\n\ndt\n= ???S tan iHS\n\ndi\n\ndt\n. (10.16)\n\nAs long as the orbit remains close to the Sun-synchronous position, whence\n?AN will remain close to the nominal time ?0, the variation di/dt is constant.\nWe shall write\n\nD? =\ndi\n\ndt\n\n????\n?0\n\n. (10.17)\n\nThe sign of this quantity may be positive or negative.\nNoting that tan iHS is always negative, (10.16) yields\n\nd?? = +??S| tan iHS|D? dt . (10.18)\n\nIntegrating d?? with respect to time with ??(t = 0) = 0, we then have\n\n?? = +??S| tan iHS|D? t , (10.19)\n\nand with a second integration,\n\n? = ?0 +\n1\n\n2\n??S| tan iHS|D? t2 , (10.20)\n\nwhence the local crossing time is given by\n\n?AN(t) = ?0 + ?? t\n2 . (10.21)\n\nThe quantity ?? is generally given in min yr?2 and it has the same sign as D? :\n\n?? =\n??S\n2K\n\n| tan iHS|D? . (10.22)\n\nWe thus find that ?AN has quadratic time dependence:\n\ni increasing: D? > 0 =? ?? > 0\n=? ?AN(t) parabola concave upwards ,\n\ni decreasing: D? < 0 =? ?? < 0\n=? ?AN(t) parabola concave downwards .\n\nFor ADEOS-1, ?? = ?2.4 min yr?2, for Aqua, ?? = +2.4 min yr?2 (see Example\n10.7), and for MetOp-A, ?? = ?3.9 min yr?2 (see Example 10.8).\n\nExample 10.7 Drift in local crossing time for the satellites ADEOS-1 and\nAqua.\n\n\n\n462 Chapter 10. Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse\n\n? For these two Sun-synchronous satellites, we make use of data provided by\nthe relevant space agencies:\n\n\u2022 ADEOS-1. The Japanese space agency NASDA (which has since become\nJAXA) provides the descending node crossing time ?DN, fixed at ?DN =\n10:30\u00b1 0:15, and also its predicted drift as time goes by, viz.,\n\n?DN = ?0 + a? + b?\n2 = 10.6872+ 4.4329\u00d7 10?6? ? 5.8434\u00d7 10?10?2 ,\n\nwhere ?DN is given in decimal hours and ? represents the time elapsed in\nhours since the time 00:00 on the launch date. As can be seen in Fig. 10.17\n(upper curve), the maximum of this quadratic function occurs when\n\n? = a/2b = 3.793\u00d7 103 h ? 158 day .\n\nThe satellite was launched on 27 August 1996, with ?DN = 10:41. This\ngoes through a maximum ?DN = 10:42 after 5 months, then returns to\n?DN = 10:41 after 10 months. Note the subsequent values: ?DN = 10:40 for\n12 months, ?DN = 10:35 for 24 months, and ?DN = 10:24 for 36 months.\nWe reach ?DN = 10:15 after 42 months. At this point the orbit must be\nmodified, because ?DN is beginning to change too quickly (but the satellite\nactually only operated for 10 months). This mission was followed up by\nADEOS-2 with the same choice for the local crossing time.\n\n\u2022 Aqua. NASA provides the crossing time at the ascending node in decimal\nhours as ?AN = 13.525h (with the nominal inclination) and ?AN = 13.565h\nafter 365 days. Figure 10.17 (lower curve) reconstructs the time depen-\ndence. In practice, the orbit of Aqua, which belongs to the A-Train, is very\nstrictly maintained.\n\n?\n\nExample 10.8 Drift in local crossing time for the MetOp-A satellites.\n\n? Figure 10.18 shows the time dependence of the ascending node crossing time\n?AN, correlated with the corresponding time dependence of the inclination i.\nFor each change in i, there is a sudden change in the gradient of ?AN.\n\nWe consider two dates between which the changes in i and a are close to\nlinear:\n\n19 October 2010 D = 292 , h = a?R = 817.518 km , i = 98.7262? ,\n25 May 2011 D = 145 , h = a?R = 817.439 km , i = 98.6980? ,\nVariation ?D = 218 , h = a?R = ?0.079 km , i = ?0.0282? .\n\n\n\n10.2 Crossing Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite 463\n\n-12 -9 -6 -3 0 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24Month ->\n\n22:42\n22:40\n22:38\n22:36\n22:34\n22:32\n22:30\n\n13:30\n13:32\n13:34\n13:36\n13:38\n13:40\n13:42\n\nLMT\nFig. 10.17 :Time depen-\n\ndence of local crossing time\n\nat the ascending node for\n\nSun-synchronous satellites,\n\ngiven in months.

As can be seen from Fig. 10.18, the satellite is\nrepositioned about once every 6 months, and ?AN(t) always remains between\n21:28 and 21:32, i.e., 21:30 to within 2min. ?\n\n\n\n464 Chapter 10.

For decreasing i, the quadratic variation of ?AN is concave\n\ndownwards.\n\n10.3 Angle Between Orbital Plane and Solar\n\nDirection\n\nThe angle between the direction of the Sun and the orbital plane of the\nsatellite plays an important role in astronautics, e.g., for the positioning of\nsolar panels. In the specialised literature, this is called the solar angle and\nit is denoted by ?. It varies over the interval [?90?,+90?], taking a positive\nvalue when the illuminated side is the one containing the normal to the orbital\nplane. The latter is in turn defined by the satellite motion, in the right-handed\ntrigonometric sense.\n\n10.3.1 Position of the Normal to the Orbital Plane\n\nThe center of the Earth is denoted by O, the center of the Sun by C,\nthe orbital plane by P , and the Earth\u2019s equatorial plane by E . We begin by\ncalculating ??, the angle between the normal n to P and the direction OC,\nwhich ranges over the interval [0?, 180?], like i.\n\nA satellite crosses the equator at its ascending node at time t = t0, corre-\nsponding to local time ?AN(t0) = ?0. We consider this in the frame ? centered\non O (see Fig. 10.1). The axis Oz is the polar axis, xOy is in E , and y?Oy is\nidentified with the line of nodes (oriented from the descending node to the\nascending node). Recall that the hour angle in degrees is obtained from the\nlocal crossing time in hours by the relation\n\n\n\n10.3 Angle Between Orbital Plane and Solar Direction 465\n\nH0 = 15(?0 ? 12) . (10.23)\n\nFor a rigorous calculation, the local crossing time should be expressed in LAT,\nrather than LMT, thereby bringing in the equation of time ET.\n\nAt another time t = t1, with ?t = t1 ? t0, the center of the Earth O has\nrevolved around C with angular speed ??S and the line of nodes has rotated\nrelative to the axes of the frame ? at the rate ??. The direction of the normal\nn to P is specified by:\n\n\u2022 the zenith angle ?n = i, which remains constant, equal to the inclination\nof the orbit,\n\n\u2022 the azimuthal angle ?n = ???t, since the origin of the azimuth is taken on\nOx at t = t0.\n\nThe direction OC of the Sun is specified by:\n\n\u2022 the zenith angle ?s = 90? ? ?, where ? is the declination at the given time,\n\u2022 the azimuthal angle ?s = 90? ?H0 + ??S?t, since H0 corresponds to the\n\nhour angle at t = t0.\n\nThe Cartesian components of the unit normal vector n and the unit vector s\nin the direction OC of the Sun are thus given by:\n\nn =\n\n?\n?x = cos(???t) sin iy = sin(???t) sin i\n\nz = cos i\n\n?\n? , (10.24)\n\ns =\n\n?\n?x = sin(H0 ? ??S?t) cos ?y = cos(H0 ? ??S?t) cos ?\nz = sin ?\n\n?\n? . (10.25)\n\nThe angle ?? is thus determined within its range of possible values.\n\n10.3.2 Angle ?\n\nThe angle ? = ?? ? 90? is obtained from the scalar product n \u00b7 s by\nsin? = sin i cos ? sin\n\n[\nH0 + (?? ? ??S)?t\n\n]\n+ cos i sin ? , (10.26)\n\nwhich gives the value of ? within its range of definition. For Sun-synchronous\nsatellites, we have ?? = ??S and (10.26) simplifies to\n\nsin? = sin i cos ? sinH0 + cos i sin ? . (10.27)\n\nFor non-Sun-synchronous satellites, the hour angleH0 takes all possible values\nand sinH0 varies between ?1 and +1. The extremal values of sin? are thus\n\nsin? = \u00b1 sin i cos ? + cos i sin ? = sin(? \u00b1 i) . (10.28)\n\n\n\n466 Chapter 10. Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse\n\nThe declination ? varies over the interval [??,+?], with obliquity ? = 23.4?.\nThe angle ? thus varies over the interval\n\n? ? [?(i+ ?),+(i+ ?)] , (10.29)\nlimited, of course, to the interval of definition of ?.\n\nHence, for Megha-Tropiques, i = 20.0?, ? ? [?43.4?,+43.4?]; for ISS, i =\n51.6?, ? ?

For each of these satellites, we plot the variation of each angle determining\nthe direction of the normal to the orbital plane and the direction of the Sun.\nThese variations are shown graphically in Figs. 10.19 and 10.20:\n\n\u2022 Direction of the Sun. The elevation ? = 90? ? ?s corresponds to the decli-\nnation. The azimuth ?s has a cycle of 1 year, and it does not vary exactly\nlinearly with time (the difference being the equation of time ET).\n\n\u2022 Direction of the normal to the orbital plane. The zenith angle ?n remains\nconstant, since the inclination is constant. The main difference between the\nSun-synchronous and non-Sun-synchronous satellites is manifested through\nthe variation of the azimuthal angle ?n. For the Sun-synchronous satellite,\n?n goes round once in 1 year as viewed from ?, whereas for the non-Sun-\nsynchronous satellite with fast nodal precession, the cycle is much shorter\n(and retrograde).\n\n\u2022 The angle ? between the direction of the Sun and the orbital plane. For\nCalipso, ? varies from 20? to 35?. The general shape of the graph of ?\nas a function of time is heavily influenced by the equation of time. For\nMegha-Tropiques, the amplitude is much greater, with the angle varying\nfrom ?45? to +45?. In this case, it is occasionally necessary to turn the\nsatellite round so that its solar panels are more effectively illuminated.\n\n?\n\n10.4 Solar Eclipse for Circular Orbits\n\nThe satellite undergoes solar eclipse when the Sun is hidden from it by\nthe Earth.

The\nword \u201cecliptic,\u201d referring to the orbital plane of the Earth around the Sun, is a more recent\nconstruction.

It is useful to know the duration of the eclipse,\nto know for how long during one revolution the satellite will be deprived of\nsolar light. This problem is particularly important for LEO satellites in near-\ncircular orbits and for geostationary satellites.\n\n10.4.1 Duration of Solar Eclipse\n\nIf at a given time the direction of the Sun lies in the orbital plane P of\nthe satellite, i.e., if ? = 0 (for the ascending node, ?AN = 00:00 or 12:00), it is\neasy to calculate the proportion of the orbit that lies in shadow. Figure 10.21\n(left) shows the circular Earth with center O and radius R, and the orbit of\nthe satellite, with radius r and in the plane P . We obtain the angle ?0 (the\nangle ? when ? = 0) from\n\nsin?0 =\nOA\n\nOB\n=\n\nR\n\nr\n=\n\n1\n\n?\n,\n\nwhence we can find the fraction of the orbit in shadow as ?/?.\nIf the direction of the Sun does not lie in the orbital plane, i.e., if ? ?= 0, we\n\ndefine an orthonormal frame (O;X,Y, Z), centered on O, and where OY lies\nin the antisolar direction. The Earth\u2019s shadow defines a cylinder with axis OY\nand radius R. The set of all possible orbits similar to the circular orbit under\nconsideration constitutes a sphere of radius r centered on O. The intersection\nof the sphere and the cylinder gives a circle of radius R, perpendicular to OY\n\n\n\n470 Chapter 10. Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse\n\n(see Fig. 10.21). When the satellite crosses this circle it enters and leaves the\neclipse.\n\nThe angle ? measuring the length of the arc in shadow is given by\n\ncos? =\nOB?\n\nOB\n, cos? =\n\nOQ\n\nOB?\n,\n\nwhence\n\ncos? =\ncos?0\ncos?\n\n. (10.30)\n\nIf T is the period and the angles are in radians, we obtain the expression for\nthe duration of the eclipse, denoted by ?te, by calculating the quantity U,\nviz.,\n\nU =\n\n?\n1? 1/?2\ncos?\n\n=?\n{\n?te =\n\nT\n\n?\narccosU , if U < 1 ,\n\n?te = 0 , if U ? 1 .\n(10.31)\n\nGiven the value of ? from (10.26), we can thus obtain ?te for any circular\norbit. We give two examples in Fig. 10.22 for two non-Sun-synchronous LEO\nsatellites.\n\nBelow we examine the case of Sun-synchronous satellites in more detail.\n\n10.4.2 Sun-Synchronous LEO Orbit\n\nFor a Sun-synchronous satellite in low circular orbit (i ? 100?), the value\nof sin?, in (10.27), and hence of ?te, depends essentially on H0, representing\nthe fixed ascending node crossing time ?AN (LMT). Figures 10.23 and 10.24\ngive the length of the eclipse during each revolution, as the year goes by,\nfor a \u201cstandard\u201d Sun-synchronous orbit with h = 700 km. For this orbit, all\npossible values of ?AN from 00:00 to 24:00 are shown, in steps of a quarter of\nan hour.\n\nFor ?AN = 06:00 (dawn\u2013dusk orbit), we have ?te = 0 right through the\nyear, except for mid-November to the end of January, with ?te going through\na maximum of 19min at the winter solstice. For ?AN = 18:00 (dawn\u2013dusk\norbit), eclipse occurs around the summer solstice (see Fig. 10.28).\n\nFor ?AN = 00:00 or 12:00 (noon\u2013midnight orbit), ?te is constant during\nthe year with ?te = 35min. When ?AN is more than 3 h away from the\ndawn\u2013dusk orbit, eclipse occurs daily, and always lasts more than 28min (see\nFig. 10.29 upper).\n\nThere is a certain disymmetry in the graphs here.4 It can be put down to\nthe equation of time ET, which gives the difference between times in LMT and\nLAT. The ascending node crossing times are in LMT on the graphs, whereas\nthe eclipse configuration depends on LAT.\n\n4As an example, consider the most striking case. On 11 February or 1 November, the\ndeclination is the same, but the equation of time is very different, not being far from its\n\n\n\n10.4 Solar Eclipse for Circular Orbits 471\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360 390 420 450 480 510 540 570 600 630 660 690 720 750 780\n\nJAN\n2012\n\nFEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC JAN\n2013\n\nFEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC JAN\n2014\n\nFEB\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n38\n\n40\n\n(min)\n\nTRMM [2]\nPrecess. cycle=  47 days   (Cs= -47.4)\n\nECLIPSE: duration (minute)\nfor each revolution\n\nAltitude =  402.6 km\n\nInclination  =  34.97 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =    92.39 min\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360 390 420 450 480 510 540 570 600 630 660 690 720 750 780\n\nDEC\n2012 2013\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC JAN\n2014\n\nFEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC JAN\n2015\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n24\n\n26\n\n28\n\n30\n\n32\n\n34\n\n36\n\n38\n\n40\n\n(min)\n\nJason-2 / OSTM\nPrecess. cycle= 118 days   (Cs=-117.6)\n\nECLIPSE: duration (minute)\nfor each revolution\n\nAltitude = 1336.3 km\n\nInclination  =  66.04 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   112.43 min\n\nFig. 10.22 :Duration of solar eclipse in minutes, for each revolution, as a function of\n\nthe day of the year for non-Sun-synchronous LEO satellites.

Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse\n\n10.4.3 Dawn\u2013Dusk Sun-Synchronous LEO Orbit\n\nEclipse Conditions\n\nFor Sun-synchronous dawn\u2013dusk orbits, eclipses are critical events. Using\nthe condition (10.31), applied to the dawn\u2013dusk orbit, let us look for the\ncase where eclipse is avoided, for whatever day of the year. The strongest\nconstraint is obtained at one of the two solstices, with |?| = ? = 23.44?.\nUnder these conditions, when ? is varied between 1 and 1.9367, the maximal\nvalue for a Sun-synchronous satellite, given by (7.107), the condition on ? and\n? is satisfied when ? lies between 1.2181 and 1.5221. Using the altitude, we\nobtain\n\nabsence of eclipse ?? 1 391 km < h < 3 330 km .\n\nIf the altitude of the satellite is less than 1,391km, there will be eclipse,\nbecause the satellite is not high enough to leave the Earth\u2019s shadow (at least\nat the solstice). If the altitude is greater than 3,330km, the orbit is close\nenough to the equatorial plane (i tends to 180?) and the ecliptic to mean\nthat, despite its high altitude, the satellite nevertheless passes through the\nshadow.\n\nThese observations are rather theoretical. In practice, most satellites in\ndawn\u2013dusk orbit are equipped with radar\u2014with the constraint (C4) consid-\nered earlier\u2014and an altitude less than 800 km is then the norm. The eclipse\nphenomenon is thus inevitable at some point during the year for an LEO\nsatellite.\n\nDates of Eclipse\n\nWhen there is eclipse, we calculate how long it will last as a function of\nthe date. The results are given in Fig. 10.25 for altitudes between 200 and\n1,200km. The eclipse lasts longer for lower altitudes and reaches its maximal\nlength ?te at the solstice (northern winter solstice if ?AN = 06:00, northern\n\nextremal values:\n\n? = ?14.3?\n{\n11 February ET = +14 min ,\n1 November ET = ?16 min .\n\nConsider Fig. 10.24 (upper). On 11 February, the 16:00 curve indicates an eclipse lasting\n?te = 21min, which corresponds to\n\nLAT = LMT ?ET = 16:00 ? 0:14 = 15:46 .\n\nOn 1 November, this same value of ?te = 21min is obtained with the 15:30 curve, which\ncorresponds to\n\nLAT = LMT ?ET = 15:30 + 0:16 = 15:46 .\n\nAt LMT times differing by 30min, but at the same LAT times, the two dates yield the\nsame length of eclipse.\n\n\n\n10.4 Solar Eclipse for Circular Orbits 475\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 365\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nDay of the year\n\nD\nur\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nof\n\n s\nol\n\nar\n e\n\ncl\nip\n\nse\n (\n\nm\nin\n\n) \nfo\n\nr \nea\n\nch\n r\n\nev\nol\n\nut\nio\n\nn\n\n200\n\n200\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n1100\n\n1200\n\n250\n\n250Altitude (km)\nSun-synchronous\n06:00\n\n18:00\n\norbit\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 365\n\nJAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nDay of the year\n\nD\nur\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nof\n\n s\nol\n\nar\n e\n\ncl\nip\n\nse\n (\n\nm\nin\n\n) \nfo\n\nr \nea\n\nch\n r\n\nev\nol\n\nut\nio\n\nn\n\n200\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\n900\n\n1000\n\n1100\n\n1200\n\n250\n\n250\n\nAltitude (km)\nSun-synchronous\norbit\n\nFig. 10.25 :Duration of solar eclipse in minutes, for each revolution, as a function of\n\nthe day of the year for dawn\u2013dusk Sun-synchronous satellites, for various altitudes\n\nfrom h = 200 to h = 1,200 km.

So identifying LMT and LAT, we may write\n\n06:00 LMT =? sinH0 = ?1 , 18:00 LMT =? sinH0 = +1 .\n\nIn (10.27), we then write sinH0 = ? with ? = \u00b11, depending on which of the\ntwo LMT times we are referring to. This gives\n\nsin? = sin(? + ?i) .\n\nSince the satellite is Sun-synchronous (iHS > 90\n?), it is more convenient with\n\nregard to the domain of variation of the angles to consider j = iHS ? 90?,\nrather than iHS. The last relation then becomes\n\nsin? = cos(? + ?j) .\n\nThe condition for no eclipse arising from (10.31), viz.,\n\n?\n1? 1\n\n?2\n> cos? ,\n\nthen becomes\n\n1\n\n?\n< cos(? + ?j) . (10.32)\n\nWe thus obtain\n\nabsence of eclipse ?? |? + ?j| < arccos 1\n?\n. (10.33)\n\nThe following is an example of this type of calculation.\n\nExample 10.10 Calculate the eclipse dates for SMOS and GOCE.\n\n? The two European satellites SMOS and GOCE are in Sun-synchronous\ndawn\u2013dusk orbits:\n\n\u2022 SMOS. The orbital characteristics of SMOS are a = 7 133.875km (whence\nh = 756km), iHS = 98.44\n\n?, Td = 100.06min, ?AN = 06:00. We thus obtain\nj = 8.44?, ? = ?1, 1/? = 0.8942, and arccos(1/?) = 26.63?. We apply\nthe eclipse condition |? + ?j| > arccos(1/?), for two cases, depending on\nwhether the declination is positive or negative:\n\n\n\n10.4 Solar Eclipse for Circular Orbits 477\n\nif ? > 0, ? ? 8.44 > 26.63, which is never possible ,\n\nif ? < 0, |?|+ 8.44 > 26.63, or |?| > 18.19? .\n\nThese negative values of the declination correspond to the eclipse interval\n[15 November to 28 January]. The maximal length of eclipse occurs at the\nwinter solstice, for ? = ?? :\n\ncos? =\nsin(26.63)\n\nsin(31.88)\n= 0.8487 , whence ? = 31.93? .\n\nThe length of the eclipse per revolution is\n\n?te = Td\n31.93\n\n180\n= 17.75 ? 18 min ,\n\nwhich can be checked from Fig. 10.23 with h = 700km rather than h =\n756km.\n\n\u2022 GOCE. The orbital characteristics of this satellite are a = 6 632.488km\n(whence h = 254km), iHS = 96.54\n\n?, Td = 89.72min, ?AN = 18:00. We thus\nobtain j = 6.54?, ? = +1, 1/? = 0.9617 and arccos(1/?) = 15.92?. For\npositive and negative declinations, we now have:\n\nif ? > 0, ? + 6.54 > 15.92, or ? > 9.38?,\nimplying the date interval [15 April to 29 August] ,\n\nif ? < 0, |?| ? 6.54 > 15.92, or |?| > 22.46?,\nimplying the date interval [6 December to 7 January] .\n\nWemay say that there are two eclipse seasons, a long one in the summer and\na short one in the winter, as can be clearly seen from Fig. 10.25, h = 250km\n(and h = 254km for GOCE). The maximal length of the summer eclipse\noccurs at the solstice:\n\ncos? =\nsin(15.92)\n\nsin(23.44 + 6.54)\n, whence ? = 56.7? , ?te = 28.26 ? 28 min .\n\nThe maximal length of the winter eclipse also occurs at the solstice:\n\ncos? =\nsin(15.92)\n\nsin(23.44? 6.54) , whence ? = 19.3\n? , ?te = 9.66 ? 10 min .\n\nWe can calculate the minimal altitude for which the short eclipse season\ncan be avoided. With j = 6.54? and with the value iHS for GOCE, the\ncondition at the solstice is\n\narccos\n1\n\n?\n= 23.44? 6.54 = 16.90? , whence ? = 1.045 14 , h = 288 km .\n\n\n\n478 Chapter 10. Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse\n\nNow calculating the value of iHS for this altitude using (7.105), we obtain\nthe value i = 96.63? and hence\n\narccos\n1\n\n?\n= 23.44? 6.63 = 16.81? , whence ? = 1.044 64 , h = 285 km .\n\nA further iteration leads to the same result. If the altitude of the orbit is\ngreater than 285 km, there will be only one eclipse season.\n\n?\n\n10.4.4 MEO Orbit\n\nMEO satellites have a long cycle CS, close to 1 year, since they have very\nsmall precession rates, e.g., 351 days for Navstar/GPS, 353 days for Glonass,\n356 days for Galileo, and 354 days for BeiDou NS. Twice during the cycle\n(once in the ascending part of the orbit and once in the descending part), the\nsatellite finds itself in an eclipse situation. Eclipses occur for about a month,\nwith a maximal duration of around 60min.\n\nThe date of the eclipse depends on the ascending node crossing time taken\nas reference. Figure 10.26 (upper) shows the length of the eclipse ?te as\na function of the date for the Galileo constellation. The figure shows four\nascending node crossing times on 1 January, with 6 h spacing, viz., ?AN =\n00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00.\n\n10.4.5 GEO Orbit\n\nThe situation for GEO satellites can be treated quite generally. We set\ni = 0 in (10.26) and obtain ? = ?, which is the very definition of the declination\n?. We then apply the condition (10.31) with ? = ?GS defined by (7.72).\n\nWe may also look at things more specifically. For a geostationary satellite,\nno shadow is cast by the Earth on the circular orbit as long as the direction\nof the Sun has an inclination (declination ?) with respect to the equatorial\nplane greater than the angle with which the satellite views the Earth. Let f0\nbe this angle, which is the half-angle at the apex of the observation cone with\nwhich the satellite views the Earth and to which we shall return in Chap. 12\n[see in particular (12.33)]. The relation sin f0 = 1/?GS gives f0 = 8.7\n\n?.\nThere is therefore an eclipse if |?| < f0. This happens twice a year, around\n\nthe equinoxes:\n\neclipse for GEO ??\n{\n[27 February to 12 April]\n\n[1 September to 16 October]\n\nDuring these two periods of 45 days (from D = 58 to D = 102 and from\nD = 244 to D = 289, although dates may vary by 1 day depending on the\n\n\n\n10.5 General Conditions for Solar Eclipse 479\n\nyear), the longest eclipse occurs at the equinoxes. On that day, it lasts for a\ntime\n\n?te =\nf0\n?\nT0 =\n\n8.7\n\n180\nDsid = 69.5 min ? 1 h 10 min . (10.34)\n\nThe value of ?te as a function of the day of the year is shown in Fig. 10.26\n(lower).\n\n10.5 General Conditions for Solar Eclipse\n\nSo far we have calculated the dates and lengths of eclipse and provided\nanalytic formulas in the case of circular orbits. In the general case, for orbits\nwith arbitrary eccentricity, such simple formulas are no longer possible, be-\ncause too many orbital elements need to be taken into account. However, there\nis a general method for determining the period of eclipse for any satellite.\n\n10.5.1 Establishing General Eclipse Conditions\n\nTo calculate the angle ?, we chose an arbitrary origin for the axes of the\nframe ?. In order to obtain general eclipse conditions, it is simpler and more\nlogical to choose the direction of the vernal equinox as origin, given that this\nkind of practical calculation is done using the NORAD elements (where ? is\nmeasured from this point ?).\n\nWe thus consider a geocentric pseudo-Galilean frame ?, where z?Oz is the\npolar axis, Oxy lies in the Earth\u2019s equatorial plane E , and Ox points to the\nvernal equinox.\n\nPosition of the Sun\n\nThe plane E makes an angle ?, the obliquity, with the plane of the ecliptic\n(see Fig. 7.7). Indicating the position of the Sun by the ecliptic longitude l\nas defined in (7.46), we obtain the components of the unit vector s in the\ndirection of the Sun:\n\ns =\n\n?\n? x = cos ly = sin l cos ?\nz = sin l sin ? = sin ?\n\n?\n? . (10.35)\n\nWith (7.62), we obtain the same value z as in (10.25). For these eclipse cal-\nculations, an accuracy of 0.1? in the angles is sufficient, since the apparent\ndiameter of the Sun is 0.5?. We thus take ? = 23.4?. For the solar longitude,\nthe relation (7.64), viz.,\n\nl =\n360\n\n365\n(D ? 81) + 1.9 sin 360\n\n365\n(D ? 3) , (10.36)\n\nis adequate, where D is the day of the year, i.e., D = 1, . . . , 365.\n\n\n\n480 Chapter 10.

The Earth creates a cylinder of shadow\n\nwith axis in the direction OQ of the Sun. When the orbit of the satellite S passes\n\ninside the cylinder, in this case between Sa and Sb, the satellite undergoes solar\n\neclipse.\n\nPosition of the Satellite\n\nFor the position of the satellite S, we go back to the specification of its\nmotion in terms of Euler angles, as discussed in Chap. 8, measuring ?, the\nright ascension of the ascending node, from the vernal equinox. For the unit\nvector er in the direction of r = OS, we thus obtain the components given\nin (8.10):\n\ner =\n\n?\n?x = cos? cos(? + v)? sin? sin(? + v) cos iy = sin? cos(? + v) + cos? sin(? + v) cos i\n\nz = sin(? + v) sin i\n\n?\n? . (10.37)\n\nRecall that\n\nr = rer , r =\na(1? e2)\n1 + e cos v\n\n.\n\nLet ? be the angle between the direction of the satellite and the direction\nopposite to the Sun, with unit vector ?s. It is determined by the scalar\nproduct\n\ncos? = ?er\u00b7s . (10.38)\n\n\n\n482 Chapter 10. Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse\n\nCylinder of Shadow\n\nWe treat the Earth as a sphere and the Sun as a point. The planet then\nproduces a cylinder of shadow with axis ?s and radius R (equatorial radius).\nThe orbit of the satellite can cut the cylinder of shadow, in which case there\nwill be an eclipse. In Fig. 10.27, the satellite undergoes an eclipse between the\npositions Sa and Sb.\n\nLet Q be the foot of the perpendicular drawn from Sa (or Sb) to the cylin-\nder axis. In this case, the angle ?, then denoted by ?0, represents the angle\nbetween the plane of the orbit and the direction of the Sun. This is the solar\nangle ?. The value of ?0 is obtained from the relation\n\nsin?0 =\nSaQ\n\nOSa\n=\n\nR\n\nr\n=\n\n1\n\n?\n. (10.39)\n\nIn this case, we thus have sin? = 1/? when the satellite enters and leaves\neclipse.\n\n10.5.2 Criterion for Eclipse\n\nIf there is eclipse (S between Sa and Sb), the angle ? is less than ?0.\nOtherwise there is no eclipse. As the satellite position is given by the true\nanomaly v, calculated as a function of time, the method here is to calculate\nthe vectors s and er and the distance r at each instant of time, then compare\n? and ?0 :{\n\n? = arccos(?er\u00b7s) ,\n?0 = arcsin(1/?) ,\n\n=?\n{\n? < ?0 ?? eclipse ,\n? > ?0 ?? no eclipse .\n\n(10.40)\n\nThis method requires the use of a propagation software such as Ixion. Note\nthat we do not have to calculate ? explicitly. Figures 10.28, 10.29, and 10.30\nwere obtained using this method.\n\n\n\n10.5 General Conditions for Solar Eclipse 483\n\nTerraSAR-X\nOrbit - Ground track\n\nRecurrence = [15; +2; 11] 167\n\n2012 06 22 00:00:00 UTC  >>>    720.0 min =   0.50 day\n\nnight ECLIPSE night 0 15 30 45 60 75 90Eclipse and Sun elev. 22 JUN22 JUN\n\nAltitude =  505.4 km\n\ne = 0.000175\n\na = 6883.518 km\n\nIncl. / SUN-S.= 97.45 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =    94.85 min    * rev/day =15.18\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 2639.7 km  (  23.7 \u00b0)\n\nAsc.

There are two distinct parts. The first concerns the position of the\nsatellite ground track relative to the Earth, and the second the altitude of the\nsatellite measured from the terrestrial ellipsoid.\n\n11.1 Recurrence Constraint\n\n11.1.1 Definition of Recurrence\n\nIn observation missions using LEO satellites, one often requires repeated\ncoverage of the Earth, in the sense that the satellite must periodically overfly\nthe same points of the Earth\u2019s surface. This means that, for a given point,\none is sure to recover geometrically identical observing conditions with this\nperiodicity. Such a recurrence constraint on the mission imposes specific char-\nacteristics on the orbital elements.\n\nThe recurrence period after which the satellite ground track repeats itself\nexactly on the Earth\u2019s surface is called the recurrence cycle, but also the repeat\ncycle. This corresponds to the cycle relative to the Earth and we denote its\nvalue by CT, where the subscript T stands for \u201cterrestrial\u201d, just as we denoted\nthe cycle relative to the Sun by CS in the last chapter.\n\nWhen recurrence has been achieved, the ground track of the satellite forms\na fixed grid with respect to the Earth, which covers the globe between the\nhighest attained latitudes. One point on the grid (the ascending node is gener-\nally chosen) fixes the whole thing. We shall study this recurrence grid below.\n\nM. Capderou, Handbook of Satellite Orbits: From Kepler to GPS,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-03416-4 11,\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014\n\n487\n\n\n\n488 Chapter 11. Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\nThe calculational methods developed here to analyse recurrence remain\nvalid even if the satellite has an eccentric orbit. However, in practice, all\nrecurrent LEO satellites are in near-circular orbits. On the other hand, recur-\nrence is not restricted to LEO satellites, but is used for MEO satellites and\nHEO communications satellites.\n\nDaily Recurrence Frequency\n\nThe precession angle, i.e., the Euler angle ?1 in our notation, plays a key\nrole in the study of recurrence. Using (7.37) and (8.17), we obtain\n\n??1 = ?(??T ? ??) = ?\n2?\n\nDM\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1? P\nN ?yr\n\n)\n, (11.1)\n\n??1 = ?\nnd\n?\n\n, (11.2)\n\nwhere N ?yr, DM, P , and ? are as defined in Chap. 7.\nThe daily recurrence frequency defined by (7.43), viz.,\n\n? =\n?\n\n1 +\n1? P\nN ?yr\n\n, (11.3)\n\nallows one to compare the Earth\u2019s rotation, the satellite motion, and its nodal\nprecession via the angular speeds. It is close to ?, the daily orbital frequency,\nbut it is not the same, except for Sun-synchronous satellites. Indeed only in\nthe latter case do we have ? = ?, since P = 1.\n\n11.1.2 Calculating the Recurrence Cycle CT\n\nThe intersection of the ascending ground track of the satellite with the\nequator defines an ascending node of longitude ?0. If the satellite is recurrent,\nits ground track will pass precisely through this point ?0 on the equator, CT\ndays later. The satellite will have made a whole number of round trips between\nthese two crossings. The number of round trips is denoted by NTo , whereas\nCT is an arbitrary real number, unlikely to be an integer. Throughout the rest\nof this chapter, we shall attach the subscript \u201co\u201d to whole numbers (integers)\nentering our calculations.\n\nFrom the above discussion, we obtain the following relation which gives the\nlength L of the time interval between the two crossings at the same ascending\nnode ?0 :\n\nL = CTDM = NToTd . (11.4)\n\nDuring this time L, the orbital plane makes a whole number of round trips,\ndenoted by ko, relative to the frame ?T, since the ground track returns exactly\nto an earlier position. This yields\n\n\n\n11.1 Recurrence Constraint 489\n\nL(??T ? ??) = 2?ko . (11.5)\n\nEquations (11.4) and (7.43) now imply\n\nNToTd\nnd\n?\n\n= 2?ko ,\n\nwhich gives (since Td = 2?/nd)\n\n? =\nNTo\nko\n\n.\n\nThis relation shows that, for a recurrent satellite, the parameter ? which we\nhave called the daily recurrence frequency is a rational number:\n\nrecurrent satellite ?? ? rational . (11.6)\n\nIn terms of the daily orbital frequency ?, we have\n\nCTDM = NTo\nDM\n?\n\n,\n\nwhich implies that the cycle relative to the Earth is\n\nCT =\nNTo\n?\n\n. (11.7)\n\nThe whole number ko defined above, which represents a whole number of days,\nwill be denoted by CTo . Hence,\n\nCTo =\nNTo\n?\n\n. (11.8)\n\nIn the general case, we distinguish the recurrence cycle CT from the integer\nrecurrence cycle CTo . In the special case of Sun-synchronous satellites (and it\nshould be noted that this type of satellite covers most cases of recurrence), CT\nand CTo coincide, since in this case ? = ?. This means that, for a recurrent\nsatellite:\n\n\u2022 If it is Sun-synchronous, its ground track always returns to the same point\nat the same time, i.e., at the end of a whole number of days, and CT is an\ninteger.\n\n\u2022 If it is not Sun-synchronous, its ground track returns to a given point at\ndifferent times, and CT is not an integer.\n\nRelationship with Cycle Relative to the Sun\n\nThe cycle CS relative to the Sun and the cycle CT relative to the Earth\nboth depend on the orbital characteristics, but not in a one-to-one manner.\nThe orbital parameters of a satellite can be varied in such a way that, for\nexample, CS remains constant while CT takes any value we wish.\n\n\n\n490 Chapter 11. Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\nHowever, a useful relation can be brought out concerning the difference\nCT ? CTo and the cycle CS. From the definitions of CS, CT, CTo , P , and ?,\nwe may write\n\n?\n\n?\n= 1? 1\n\nCS\n, (11.9)\n\nCT ? CTo\nCT\n\n= 1? CTo\nCT\n\n= 1? ?\n?\n=\n\n1\n\nCS\n.\n\nWe thus obtain CT, given CTo and CS :\n\nCT =\nCTo\n\n1? 1/CS\n. (11.10)\n\nFor a Sun-synchronous satellite, CT = CTo , since CS is infinite.\n\n11.1.3 Recurrence Triple\n\nThe rational number ?, the daily recurrence frequency, can thus be ex-\npressed in the form\n\n? =\nNTo\nCTo\n\n. (11.11)\n\nIt can be written as the sum of an integer and a positive or negative fractional\npart with modulus less than 1/2:\n\n? = ?o +\nDTo\nCTo\n\n. (11.12)\n\nIn this expression, ?o is the whole number closest to ? and DTo is the unique\ninteger such\n\nDTo = NTo ? ?oCTo . (11.13)\n\nHence,\n\n??\n?\n\n|DTo | <\n1\n\n2\nCTo ,\n\n|DTo | and CTo coprime .\n\nWe shall call the triple of numbers ?o, DTo , and CTo the recurrence triple of\nthe satellite, written\n\n[?o , DTo , CTo ] .\n\nThe recurrence of a satellite orbit can thus be defined equivalently via the\nrecurrence triple or the pair of whole numbers NTo and CTo .\n\n\n\n11.2 Recurrence of Sun-Synchronous LEO Satellites 491\n\nThe value of ? obtained in this way from (11.11) or from (11.12) thus\nyields ? via (11.3), and hence the period or mean motion, after an iterative\ncalculation on P . The period in minutes is given as a function of NTo , CTo ,\nand P by\n\nTd (min) = 1440\nCTo\nNTo\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1? P\nN ?yr\n\n)\n. (11.14)\n\nThis iterative calculation involves making a first estimate of T , which gives\na, and using a with i to obtain P . This in turn gives a new value of T . The\niteration converges rapidly to give a final value for the period.\n\nWe provide example calculations below. Naturally, all these calculations\nare much simpler for a Sun-synchronous satellite, since P = 1. It is for this\nreason that we separate the following discussion into two parts, depending on\nwhether the satellite is Sun-synchronous or not.\n\n11.2 Recurrence of Sun-Synchronous LEO\n\nSatellites\n\n11.2.1 Method for Obtaining Recurrence\n\nWe have seen that the altitude of a Sun-synchronous satellite in near-\ncircular orbit lies between the theoretical bounds h = 0 and h = 5,964km,\nwhich corresponds to values of the daily orbital frequency of ? = 17.03 and\n? = 6.34 respectively. In current practice, when h is situated between 400 and\n1,000km, ? varies between 15.5 and 13.8 round trips per day.\n\nFor a Sun-synchronous satellite, it is a simple matter to obtain recurrence\nconditions since ? = ?. The daily orbital frequency ? = ?(a), which only\ndepends on a here, since i and a are related, is a rational number which can\nbe written in the form\n\n? = ?o +\nDTo\nCTo\n\n. (11.15)\n\nThe satellite ground track repeats every CTo days, after NTo = ?CTo\nrevolutions.\n\n11.2.2 Recurrence Module\n\nPresentation\n\nWe begin with a simple example, considering satellites with frequency ?\nbetween 14 and 15:\n\n\u2022 If the satellite recurrence cycle is 1 day, we have ? = 14 or 15.\n\n\n\n492 Chapter 11. Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\n\u2022 If it is 2 days, then during this 2 day cycle, it makes NTo = 28, 29, or 30\nround trips. But if NTo = 28 or 30, recurrence has already been taken into\naccount by CTo = 1 day. There thus remains the recurrence NTo = 29,\nrepresented by the triple [14 , 1 , 2].\n\n\u2022 If it is 3 days, then during this 3 day cycle, it makes NTo = 42, 43, 44, or\n45 revolutions. There remain the recurrences NTo = 43 or 44, represented\nby the triples [14 , +1 , 3] and [15 , ?1 , 3].\n\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\nEstablishing the Recurrence Module\n\nThe recurrence module represents the possible recurrences for an interval\n[?o, ?o + 1]. For each value of CTo , represented on the horizontal axis, we\nindicate the possible recurrences opposite the corresponding value of ? on\nthe vertical axis. If CTo is a prime number, all possible values of DTo are\nrepresented. Otherwise, the only values ofDTo represented are those such that\nthe numbers CTo and |DTo | are coprime, i.e., they have no common factors.\nIn its relationship with the prime numbers, this diagram is reminiscent of the\nsieve of Eratosthenes.1 Figure 11.1 exemplifies2 for CTo < 38.\n\nIf we stack up all these modules for different successive values of ?o, we\nobtain the recurrence diagram. We replace the scale linear in ? by a scale\nlinear in altitude.3\n\n11.2.3 Recurrence Diagram\n\nThe recurrence diagram is designed as an aid to visualising the altitudes\nleading to different recurrence situations. It is basically a graph in which the\naltitudes, from lowest to highest, are marked on the ordinate axis and the\nrecurrence cycles (in days) on the abscissa.\n\n1Eratosthenes of Cyrene (284\u2013192 bc), ? \n3????/4?? \t? ??\t, was a Greek astronomer,\nmathematician, and geographer. He discovered a systematic method for obtaining the se-\nquence of prime numbers up to any desired value. One writes down the sequence of positive\nintegers, then crosses out the multiples of 2, of 3, of 5, and so on. This method, which sifts\nthe positive integers, keeping only the primes, is known as the sieve of Eratosthenes. His\nabilities as an astronomer and geographer are revealed by a scientific and relatively accurate\nmeasurement of the Earth\u2019s radius, in which he measured the shadow cast by a column in\nAlexandria at noon on a day when he knew that the Sun\u2019s rays reached the bottom of the\nwells in ancient Syene (Assouan), the day of the summer solstice at Syene, under the Tropic\nof Cancer. He determined the obliquity of the ecliptic and estimated at 47?42? the arc of\nthe meridian between the two tropics.\n\n2Such a graph can also be interpreted by identifying the values of DTo . Taking for\nexample DTo = \u00b17, this value appears for all values of CTo greater than 2\u00d7 |DTo | = 14,\nexcept for CTo = 21, 28, 35, etc., that is, multiples of 7.\n\n3It is only when we change from ? to a or h that the type of orbit (inclination, Sun-\nsynchronous or otherwise) becomes relevant. The recurrence module is established without\nreferring to any particular type of satellite and is even independent of the notion of satellite!\nThe only condition is that the phenomenon under consideration should occur uniformly in\ntime.\n\n\n\n11.2 Recurrence of Sun-Synchronous LEO Satellites 493\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38\n\n0.00\n\n0.25\n\n0.50\n\n0.75\n\n1.00\n\n   1\n\n + 1\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 3\n\n - 3\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 3\n\n - 3\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 4\n\n - 4\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 3\n\n - 3\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 3\n\n + 4\n\n + 5\n\n - 5\n\n - 4\n\n - 3\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 5\n\n - 5\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 3\n\n + 4\n\n + 5\n\n + 6\n\n - 6\n\n - 5\n\n - 4\n\n - 3\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 3\n\n + 5\n\n - 5\n\n - 3\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 4\n\n + 7\n\n - 7\n\n - 4\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 3\n\n + 5\n\n + 7\n\n - 7\n\n - 5\n\n - 3\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 3\n\n + 4\n\n + 5\n\n + 6\n\n + 7\n\n + 8\n\n - 8\n\n - 7\n\n - 6\n\n - 5\n\n - 4\n\n - 3\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 5\n\n + 7\n\n - 7\n\n - 5\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 3\n\n + 4\n\n + 5\n\n + 6\n\n + 7\n\n + 8\n\n + 9\n\n - 9\n\n - 8\n\n - 7\n\n - 6\n\n - 5\n\n - 4\n\n - 3\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 3\n\n + 7\n\n + 9\n\n - 9\n\n - 7\n\n - 3\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 4\n\n + 5\n\n + 8\n\n +10\n\n -10\n\n - 8\n\n - 5\n\n - 4\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 3\n\n + 5\n\n + 7\n\n + 9\n\n - 9\n\n - 7\n\n - 5\n\n - 3\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 3\n\n + 4\n\n + 5\n\n + 6\n\n + 7\n\n + 8\n\n + 9\n\n +10\n\n +11\n\n -11\n\n -10\n\n - 9\n\n - 8\n\n - 7\n\n - 6\n\n - 5\n\n - 4\n\n - 3\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 5\n\n + 7\n\n +11\n\n -11\n\n - 7\n\n - 5\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 3\n\n + 4\n\n + 6\n\n + 7\n\n + 8\n\n + 9\n\n +11\n\n +12\n\n -12\n\n -11\n\n - 9\n\n - 8\n\n - 7\n\n - 6\n\n - 4\n\n - 3\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 3\n\n + 5\n\n + 7\n\n + 9\n\n +11\n\n -11\n\n - 9\n\n - 7\n\n - 5\n\n - 3\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 4\n\n + 5\n\n + 7\n\n + 8\n\n +10\n\n +11\n\n +13\n\n -13\n\n -11\n\n -10\n\n - 8\n\n - 7\n\n - 5\n\n - 4\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 3\n\n + 5\n\n + 9\n\n +11\n\n +13\n\n -13\n\n -11\n\n - 9\n\n - 5\n\n - 3\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 2\n\n + 3\n\n + 4\n\n + 5\n\n + 6\n\n + 7\n\n + 8\n\n + 9\n\n +10\n\n +11\n\n +12\n\n +13\n\n +14\n\n -14\n\n -13\n\n -12\n\n -11\n\n -10\n\n - 9\n\n - 8\n\n - 7\n\n - 6\n\n - 5\n\n - 4\n\n - 3\n\n - 2\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 7\n\n +11\n\n +13\n\n -13\n\n -11\n\n - 7\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n + 2\n\n + 3\n + 4\n\n + 5\n\n + 6\n + 7\n\n + 8\n + 9\n\n +10\n\n +11\n +12\n\n +13\n\n +14\n +15\n\n -15\n -14\n\n -13\n\n -12\n -11\n\n -10\n - 9\n\n - 8\n\n - 7\n - 6\n\n - 5\n - 4\n\n - 3\n\n - 2\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 3\n\n + 5\n\n + 7\n\n + 9\n\n +11\n\n +13\n\n +15\n\n -15\n\n -13\n\n -11\n\n - 9\n\n - 7\n\n - 5\n\n - 3\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n + 2\n\n + 4\n + 5\n\n + 7\n + 8\n\n +10\n\n +13\n +14\n\n +16\n -16\n\n -14\n -13\n\n -10\n\n - 8\n - 7\n\n - 5\n - 4\n\n - 2\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 3\n\n + 5\n\n + 7\n\n + 9\n\n +11\n\n +13\n\n +15\n\n -15\n\n -13\n\n -11\n\n - 9\n\n - 7\n\n - 5\n\n - 3\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n + 2\n + 3\n + 4\n\n + 6\n\n + 8\n + 9\n\n +11\n +12\n +13\n\n +16\n +17\n -17\n -16\n\n -13\n -12\n -11\n\n - 9\n - 8\n\n - 6\n\n - 4\n - 3\n - 2\n - 1\n\n + 1\n\n + 5\n\n + 7\n\n +11\n\n +13\n\n +17\n\n -17\n\n -13\n\n -11\n\n - 7\n\n - 5\n\n - 1\n\n + 1\n + 2\n + 3\n + 4\n + 5\n + 6\n + 7\n + 8\n + 9\n +10\n +11\n +12\n +13\n +14\n +15\n +16\n +17\n +18\n -18\n -17\n -16\n -15\n -14\n -13\n -12\n -11\n -10\n - 9\n - 8\n - 7\n - 6\n - 5\n - 4\n - 3\n - 2\n - 1\n\nFig. 11.1 :Recurrence module. Vertical axis: daily frequency (rev/day), lying between\n\ntwo integer values ?o and ?o + 1. Horizontal axis: recurrence cycle (day).\n\nFor each value of ?o, and for each cycle CTo , the quantity DTo is varied\nover its range of possible values and ? is obtained from (11.15). This in turn\ngives the mean motion n and draconitic period T = Td. We thus obtain the\naltitude and inclination, calculating a and i by an iterative method, as in\nExample 7.3, or Examples 11.1 and 11.2 below.\n\nThe value obtained is then marked on the diagram. In Fig. 11.2, these\nvalues are marked by small squares. When the value of DTo is absent, replaced\nby a dot, this means that there is strictly speaking no recurrence. In Figs. 11.3,\n11.4, and 11.5, the value of DTo has been noted explicitly in each case.\n\nThe diagram gives an overview of the possibilities for recurrence. For short\ncycles, we see that these possibilities are limited to a handful of values. Be-\ntween 450 and 1,000km, there is only one possible altitude for a 2 day re-\ncurrence cycle (h = 720 km for Oceansat-2) and only three possible altitudes\nfor a 3 day cycle. On the other hand, for long cycles, there are more oppor-\ntunities, especially if CTo is a prime number. For CTo = 31, there are about\n120 possibilities between 0 and 1,200km, or roughly one available altitude for\nrecurrence every 10 km.\n\n\n\n494 Chapter 11.

Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\n11.2.4 Recurrence Defined by the Recurrence Triple\n\nRecurrent Sun-synchronous satellites are defined by the recurrence triple.\nAll Sun-synchronous satellites with the same recurrence triple have the same\nperiod, and hence the same values of a and i. (They even share the same value\nof e, because the orbit is frozen, as we shall see at the end of the chapter.)\nThe recurrence triple thus defines the orbit. We may speak of the SPOT orbit\nfor all satellites having the same recurrence triple as SPOT-1.\n\nTable 11.1 provides an exhaustive list of the recurrence triples of all recur-\nrent Sun-synchronous satellites to our knowledge:\n\n\u2022 satellites whose mission has now ended, like Landsat-3,\n\u2022 satellites still in activity, like Terra,\n\u2022 satellite projects, like the Sentinel missions,\n\u2022 satellites belonging to projects that have now been abandoned, like ERM.\n\nNumbers in square brackets, e.g., [1], [2], indicate that the recurrence changes\nduring the mission, while [0] indicates that recurrence was planned but aban-\ndoned before launch. For EarthCARE, in Table 11.3 we give all the planned\nrecurrence cycles, which changed over time as the launch date was pushed\nback.4\n\nFigures 11.3, 11.4, and 11.5 show the recurrence diagram over a limited\nrange of altitudes (h between 320 and 990km) and cycles (CTo from 1 to 31\ndays). Recurrence possibilities are indicated in each case with DTo , CTo , and\n?o, deduced from ?. Values in use by satellites in Tables 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3\nare boxed.\n\nNote that the draconitic period is given in minutes by\n\nTd (min) = 1440\nCTo\nNTo\n\n, (11.16)\n\nwhich is the adaptation of (11.14) to Sun-synchronous satellites. When the\norbit of a Sun-synchronous satellite is defined by its recurrence cycle CTo and\nits approximate altitude, one must determine the recurrence triple, then return\nto the previous case. The altitude can be used to obtain ?, which gives ?o.\nOnce the cycle CTo is known, one can deduce NTo using an iterative method,\nthen obtain DTo .\n\nExample 11.1 Calculate the characteristics of the SPOT orbit.\n\n4The European mission ERM (Earth Radiation Mission) was supposed to come into\noperation around 2006, during a minimum of solar activity, thus allowing a very low altitude\norbit. Following an agreement between the ESA and JAXA, ERM was merged with the\nJapanese project ATMOS-B1 to give EarthCARE. The launch date was postponed and the\naltitude increased, following the heightened solar activity which reached the culmination of\nits 11 year cycle in 2012. When the launch date was planned after the solar maximum, a\nlower altitude was chosen.\n\n\n\n11.2 Recurrence of Sun-Synchronous LEO Satellites 499\n\nSun-syn sat. ?o DTo CTo NTo Td a h iHS\n\nLandsat-3 14 ?1 18 251 103.27 7,285.799 908 99.09\nTerra 15 ?7 16 233 98.88 7,077.738 700 98.21\nOrbView-3 15 +5 16 245 94.04 6,844.207 466 97.30\nIkonos-2 15 ?5 14 205 98.34 7,051.765 674 98.11\nQuickBird-2 15 +7 18 277 93.57 6,821.490 443 97.21\nCoriolis 14 +1 8 113 101.89 7,223.450 845 98.82\nAIM 15 ?2 23 343 96.56 6,966.149 588 97.76\nAquarius [0] 15 ?1 8 119 96.81 6,978.050 600 97.81\nAquar./SAC-D 15 ?2 7 103 97.86 7,028.876 651 98.01\nNEMO 15 ?1 7 104 96.92 6,983.652 606 97.83\nSuomi-NPP 14 +3 16 227 101.50 7,202.173 824 98.73\nJPSS-1 14 +3 17 241 101.57 7,205.917 828 98.75\nHypsIRI 15 ?1 5 74 97.30 7,001.653 624 97.90\nSCLP [1] 15 +1 6 91 94.95 6,888.104 510 97.46\nSCLP [2] 15 +2 15 227 95.09 6,898.237 520 97.50\nSMAP 15 ?3 8 117 98.46 7,057.515 679 98.13\n\nSPOT-5 14 +5 26 369 101.46 7,200.546 822 98.72\nHe?lios-2B 15 ?10 27 395 98.43 7,056.025 678 98.12\nPle?iades-1B 15 ?11 26 379 98.79 7,073.059 695 98.19\nMerlin 15 +5 28 425 94.87 6,884.494 506 97.45\ne-Corce 15 ?11 104 1,549 96.68 6,972.027 594 97.79\nEnvisat 14 +11 35 501 100.60 7,159.496 781 98.55\nERS-1 [2] 14 +1 3 43 100.46 7,153.138 775 98.52\nERS-1 [3] 14 +59 168 2,411 100.34 7,147.192 769 98.50\nMetOp-B 14 +6 29 412 101.36 7,195.606 817 98.70\nMetOp [0] 14 +1 5 71 101.41 7,197.940 820 98.71\nTerraSAR-X 15 +2 11 167 94.85 6,883.512 505 97.45\nCOSMO-SkyM 15 ?3 16 237 97.22 6,997.705 620 97.89\nADM-Aeolus 16 ?3 7 109 92.48 6,767.956 390 97.02\nEnMAP 15 ?6 23 339 97.70 7,020.958 643 97.98\nSentinel-1 15 ?5 12 175 98.74 7,070.980 693 98.18\nSentinel-2 14 +3 10 143 100.70 7,164.272 786 98.57\nSentinel-3 14 +7 27 385 100.99 7,177.940 800 98.63\nHypXIM 15 ?6 19 279 98.06 7,038.490 660 98.05\nZ-Earth 15 +39 274 4,149 95.10 6,895.497 517 97.49\n\nMOS-1B 14 ?1 17 237 103.29 7,286.941 909 99.10\nJERS-1 15 ?1 44 659 96.15 6,946.179 568 97.69\nADEOS-1 14 +11 41 585 100.92 7,174.906 797 98.61\nADEOS-2 14 +1 4 57 101.05 7,181.058 803 98.64\nALOS 15 ?19 46 671 98.66 7,069.809 692 98.18\nALOS-2 15 ?3 14 207 97.39 7,006.172 628 97.92\nIbuki (GOSat) 15 ?1 3 44 98.18 7,044.114 666 98.07\n\n\n\n500 Chapter 11.

With 3,990 revolutions, the satellite completed 10 cycles of 26\ndays. It had been launched 281 days previously. The orbital parameters are\n\u201cnominal\u201d.\n\nDates (1) and (2). These dates are separated by a cycle of 369 revolutions,\nor 26 days. We note a discrepancy for ?AN of 0.0275\n\n?, or 3.0 km, less than\nthe tolerance of 5 km for recurrence. The elements a and i remain very close\nto the theoretical values. However, e is much lower than the value needed to\nfreeze the orbit (see the end of the chapter). Consequently, there is a large\nvariation in ? around 90?. The crossing time ?AN is assured to within 2min,\nwhich is well below the variations in solar time due to the equation of time.\n\nDates (2) and (3). Between these two dates, there were 39783 ? 4359 =\n35424 = 96\u00d7 369 revolutions, exactly 96 cycles of 26 days, or 2,496 days. ?\n\nExample 11.2 Calculate the orbital characteristics of the Terra orbit.\n\n? For the orbit of satellites in the Terra family (see Table 11.2), the recurrence\ntriple is [15, ?7, 16]. The draconitic period is maintained at\n\nTd = 1440\n16\n\n233\n= 98.884 (min) .\n\nAs before, we obtain\n\na0 = 7,083.4 km , i = iHS = 98.2\n? .\n\nWe then calculate the relative values of the secular variations:\n\n?n\n\nn0\n= ?0.619\u00d7 10?3 , ??\n\nn0\n= ?0.591\u00d7 10?3 ,\n\nwhich gives the new value of the semi-major axis as a1 = 7,077.7km. By\niteration,\n\n\n\n504 Chapter 11. Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\na = 7,077.738 km , i = iHS = 98.211\n? .\n\nWe have seen that, although the value of a can be accurately determined,\nthe same cannot be said of the altitude, which varies due to the ellipticity\nof the orbit and the Earth. (We return to this question at the end of the\nchapter.) If we define the altitude h as the difference between a and the\nequatorial radius R, the value of h is well determined. In the case of Terra, we\nobtain h = 700km. The NASA documentation gives the value h = 705km for\nall satellites in the Terra orbit, the altitude having been determined slightly\ndifferently. ?\n\nExample 11.3 Calculate the orbital characteristics of the satellite ERS-1,\nwhich has had three different recurrence cycles: 35 days, 3 days, and 168\ndays.\n\n? The ESA satellite ERS-1 was launched on 17 July 1991. It flies at an altitude\nof about 780km and its orbit is Sun-synchronous. It initially had a recurrence\ncycle of 35 days. From 20 December 1993, a slight change of orbit brought the\ncycle to 3 days, better suited to the study of ice flows during the arctic winter,\naccording to the mission controllers. A further maneuver brought the cycle to\n168 days so that it could carry out geodetic observations. The satellite ERS-2,\nlaunched on 21 April 1995, carried out a mission in tandem with ERS-1 until\n10 March 2000.\n\nWe now calculate the triples for each recurrence cycle:\n\n\u2022 Recurrence cycle 1. 35 day cycle over 501 revolutions:\n\n?1 =\n501\n\n35\n= 14 +\n\n11\n\n35\n=? recurrence triple [14, 11, 35] .\n\n\u2022 Recurrence cycle 2. 3 day cycle over 43 revolutions:\n\n?2 =\n43\n\n3\n= 14 +\n\n1\n\n3\n=? recurrence triple [14, 1, 3] .\n\n\u2022 Recurrence cycle 3. 168 day cycle over 2,411 revolutions:\n\n?3 =\n2411\n\n168\n= 14 +\n\n59\n\n168\n=? recurrence triple [14, 59, 168] .\n\nFrom Td, we calculate a and i by the above method. The results are given in\nTable 11.1: ERS-1 recurrence cycle 1 as Envisat, ERS-1 recurrence cycles 2\nand 3 as ERS-1 [2] and [3].\n\nCycle changes were brought about by going from ?1 to ?2 (obtained by\nreducing the altitude by 6.358km), then from ?2 to ?3 (reducing the altitude\nby 5.948km). Very small variations in altitude lead to totally different recur-\nrence cycles, as can be seen very clearly from Fig. 11.2. These variations in\naltitude are small enough to make them easy to calculate (without carrying\n\n\n\n11.2 Recurrence of Sun-Synchronous LEO Satellites 505\n\nout the above type of iteration), applying the relation for finite increments\nalready used:\n\n??\n\n?\n= ?3\n\n2\n\n?a\n\na\n.\n\nSetting\n\narec 1 = 7,159.496 km ,\n\nwe obtain\n\n?? = ?2 ? ?1 =\n1\n\n3\n? 11\n\n35\n,\n\n??\n\n?1\n=\n\n2\n\n3\u00d7 501 ,\n\n?arec 1?rec 2 = ?6.358 km .\n\n?? = ?3 ? ?2 =\n59\n\n168\n? 1\n\n3\n,\n\n??\n\n?2\n=\n\n3\n\n56\u00d7 43 ,\n\n?arec 2?rec 3 = ?5.946 km .\n\nNote that a recurrence condition based on such a long time scale as CTo = 168\ndays is quite exceptional. Values of CTo do not generally exceed 45 days.\n\nThese three recurrence cycles are reconsidered in Example 11.16 to illus-\ntrate the notion of recurrence index. ?\n\nExample 11.4 Analysis of two images obtained by the satellite Envisat in\nterms of its recurrence cycle.\n\n? The first is the colour image of the Hawaiian islands shown in Fig. 11.6,\na combination of radar images acquired by the ASRA instrument on three\ndifferent dates:\n\nDay 27 March 2006 ? 16 April 2007 ? 21 January 2008\nMJD 53, 821 ? 54, 206 ? 54, 486\nTime elapsed 385 280\nEqual to 11\u00d7 35 8\u00d7 35\n\nThe ground track of the satellite crosses exactly the same place. The time\nelapsed between these images is a multiple of 35 days, corresponding to En-\nvisages\u2019s recurrence cycle CT. This is easier to check by converting to modified\nJulian days (MJD) [see (7.67)].\n\nThe second is the image of the Yukon delta shown in Fig. 11.7, obtained\nby combining images in the visible taken by the MODIS instrument at three\ndifferent dates separated by 4\u00d7 35 = 140 days and 35 days. ?\n\n\n\n506 Chapter 11. Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\nFig. 11.6 :Radar image of Hawaii taken by Envisat. This image, looking north, shows\n\nsix of the eight main volcanic islands of Hawaii. On the large island, Mauna Kea\n\nis visible, the highest point (4,205m), and further south, Mauna Loa (4,170m),\n\nan active volcano under surveillance. Orbiting radars, like the Advanced Synthetic\n\nAperture Radar instrument (ASAR) on board Envisat, can monitor small changes\n\nin land movements. Radar interferometry combines different radar images mathe-\n\nmatically. Such images are acquired as close as possible to the same point in space\n\nbut at different times, in order to build numerical models of land levels. Kilauea is\n\nanother of the most active volcanoes on Earth, situated in the south of the island\n\nin the regions appearing in red and pink. This image was made by combining three\n\nshots of the same region acquired by Envisat\u2019s ASAR radar on 27 March 2006, 16\n\nApril 2007, and 21 January 2008, then associating a different colour code with each.\n\nThe colours appearing on the combined image result from the changes occurring be-\n\ntween the shots. The time elapsed between these shots is a multiple of 35 days, the\n\nrecurrence cycle of the satellite, as explained in Example 11.4. Credit (image and\n\ncaption): ESA.\n\n11.2.5 One-Day Recurrence Cycle\n\nFor LEO satellites (at least, for those which observe the Earth), 1-day\nrecurrence cycles are avoided. Indeed, if such a satellite views exactly the same\nregions every day, many other places must necessarily be missed out, unless\nthe instruments have a very wide field of view. Those altitudes between 0 and\n1,250km giving a 1-day recurrence cycle appear in the recurrence diagram of\n\n\n\n11.2 Recurrence of Sun-Synchronous LEO Satellites 507\n\nFig. 11.7 : Image of the Yukon delta taken by Envisat (MERIS instrument). This\n\nEnvisat image features the Yukon delta in Alaska, where the Yukon River fans out\n\ninto a labyrinth of distributaries, before emptying into the Bering Sea. This image\n\nwas created by combining three Envisat images (19 November 2009, 8 April 2010, and\n\n13 May 2010) over the same area. The time elapsed between these shots is a multiple\n\nof 35 days, the recurrence cycle of the satellite, as explained in Example 11.4.

Its author\n\nKalidasa lived in the north of India in the fifth century and is one of the most fa-\n\nmous classical authors of Sanskrit literature. The hero of the poem is exiled for 1\n\nyear in the center of India. After 8 months of clear skies, he finally spots a cloud\n\nand asks it to carry a message to his wife, who remains at home in the foothills of\n\nthe Himalayas. He tells the cloud of all the splendid sights awaiting it on the journey\n\nto the north. Already highly charged symbolically with the connotations of the word\n\n\u201ccloud\u201d, this particular cloud, the messenger, will announce the monsoon.\n\nThe daily recurrence frequency is given by (11.3), where ? = ?(a, i) and\nP = P (a, i). We calculate the product ?CTo , allowing a and i to vary until\nwe obtain a whole number, which then represents NTo . With this value, we\nobtain ?o, the integer closest to ?, and by NTo = ?oCTo+DTo , we obtain DTo .\nThis gives the recurrence triple [?o, DTo , CTo ] and the value of CT. Recall that\nCT and CTo are given by (11.7) and (11.8).\n\nTable 11.4 gives the main recurrent, non-Sun-synchronous satellites. These\nare mostly oceanographic satellites (altimetry) or projects to monitor ice cover\nin the polar regions. In the latter category, there are some very long recurrence\ncycles, e.g., 183 days for ICESat. This satellite carries just one instrument,\na laser altimeter. The cycle guarantees that the satellite will not repeat its\nground track before half a year has gone by.\n\nThe table also shows future satellites, such as SWOT, or abandoned\nprojects like WatER-HM or TRAQ.\n\nExample 11.5 Choice of orbit for Megha-Tropiques.\n\n? In 1994, in order to study meteorological phenomena in the intertropi-\ncal region, a group of researchers mainly associated with the Laboratoire de\nme?te?orologie dynamique (LMD) of the French national research organisation\n(CNRS) had the idea of a satellite to be called Tropiques that would follow\na circular orbit at a rather high altitude (h ? 1,000km) and low inclination\n(i ? 15?). For economic and political reasons, a collaboration with India trans-\n\n\n\n510 Chapter 11.

(equal to ?o here) is in rev/day.\n\nformed this French project into a joint Indian\u2013French venture (ISRO-CNES),\nand it was renamed Megha-Tropiques, the Sanskrit word megha meaning\n\u201ccloud\u201d (see Fig. 11.8). The inclination of the orbit was changed to 20? so\nthat the Himalayas would be correctly viewed, and the altitude was reduced\nfor technical reasons related to the new instruments it would carry. This choice\nof altitude, fixed at 817 km, put the satellite at less than 3 km from the alti-\ntude for a 1-day recurrence satellite (see Table 11.6). To avoid this situation,\nwhich would be unsuitable even for a meteorological satellite, it was decided\nto impose a 7 day recurrence cycle, to take it away from the altitude range to\nbe avoided. Figure 11.9 (lower) clearly shows the situation here. There were\ntwo possibilities:\n\n\u2022 the triple [14, +1, 7], NTo = 99, with h = 764km,\n\u2022 the triple [14, ?1, 7], NTo = 97, with h = 866km.\n\nAfter weighing up the options, the higher altitude was chosen to obtain better\nsampling. With the triple [14, ?1, 7], calculation gives a = 7,243.700km and\nCT = 6.87 days (see Table 11.4). ?\n\nExample 11.6 Calculate the recurrence triple and exact altitude for the satel-\nlite TOPEX/Poseidon, which has a 10 day cycle and inclination i = 66.04?.\nIts altitude is around 1,335 km.\n\n\n\n11.3 Recurrence for Non-Sun-Synchronous LEO Satellites 511\n\n? The French\u2013US satellite TOPEX/Poseidon comprises the US platform\nTOPEX (Topography Experiment for Ocean Circulation) and the French alti-\nmetric instrument Poseidon, equipped with the DORIS system (De?termination\nd\u2019Orbite et Radiopositionnement Inte?gre?s par Satellite). Poseidon is used\nto calculate the orbit to within a radial accuracy of 2 cm, whence the\nmean altitude of the oceans can be measured to the same accuracy. The\nTOPEX/Poseidon experiment is being continued by Jason-1 then Jason-2,\nwhich use exactly the same orbit (the shift in the ground track is discussed\nbelow).\n\nTo obtain the recurrence characteristics, treating the inclination as fixed at\ni = i0 = 66.040\n\n?, we vary a between 7,700 and 7,720km (see Table 11.5). By\ninterpolation, we seek the value of a leading to the integer value ?CTo = 127.\nWith a further iteration, we obtain the result\n\na = 7,714.433 km , i = 66.040? .\n\nWe calculate the period from these elements:\n\nT = 1440\n10\n\n127\n\n(\n1 +\n\n1?

However,\nthe time elapsed between two passages is not exactly 10 days, but 9.92 days.\nIndeed,\n\nCT =\n127\n\n?\n=\n\n127\n\n12.8080\n= 9.9156 d = 9 d 21h 58m 27 s .\n\nIn 10 days, the satellite thus gains 2 h 01m 33 s = 2.043h on its local crossing\ntime. After 117.45 days, it has gained 117.45\u00d7 0.2043 = 24.00, or one whole\nday, as we have seen in Example 10.1, where CS = ?117.45 corresponds to the\ncycle relative to the Sun. The relation between CTo and CT can be obtained\ndirectly from (11.10).\n\nLet us now compare these theoretical values with those obtained using\nNORAD data:\n\nTOPEX/Poseidon\n\n1 22076U 92052A 93190.75462958 0.00000008 00000+0 00000-4 0 2807\n\n2 22076 66.0427 282.2676 0008056 266.3864 93.6223 12.80931157 42638\n\n\n\n512 Chapter 11.

For concreteness, consider\na polar satellite, with i = 90? and recurrence triple [14, ?1, 17]. Calculations\nthen give its altitude as h = 894.9km. With i = 80?, the satellite must\nbe brought down to an altitude h = 880.9km in order to obtain the same\nrecurrence triple, whereas with i = 100?, it must be moved up to an altitude\nh = 910.2km. We see that, in the neighbourhood of 90?, a change of one\ndegree in the inclination implies a change of 1.5 km in the altitude, in order\nto maintain the same recurrence conditions.\n\nFor each triple, we can calculate the value of h as a function of i, while\nthe inclination varies from 0? to 180?. The graphs h(i) are shown in Fig. 11.9\n(upper), for all triples [14, \u00b11, CTo ], where CTo varies between 5 and 17, and\nalso for the triple [14, 0, 1]. A more restricted range of variations is also shown\nin the lower part of Fig. 11.9 (lower).\n\nLet us now consider a three-dimensional space with the angle of inclination\ni along the Ox axis, the recurrence cycle CTo along the Oy axis, and the\naltitude h along the Oz axis. We then plot the locus of points for which\nrecurrence occurs. This produces a graph like the one sketched in Fig. 11.10.\nExamination of the space in the diagram shows that:\n\n\u2022 The projection of the curves onto the plane xOz gives Fig. 11.9 (upper).\n\u2022 The intersection of the curves with the plane yOz, for the Sun-synchronous\n\ninclination, gives Fig. 11.2 (or Figs. 11.3 or 11.4).\n\nAs for Sun-synchronous satellites, 1-day recurrence cycles are not gener-\nally favoured for non-Sun-synchronous satellites. The \u201cavoided\u201d altitudes are\nnoted in Table 11.6 for various inclinations.\n\n\n\n11.3 Recurrence for Non-Sun-Synchronous LEO Satellites 513\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170 180\n740\n\n760\n\n780\n\n800\n\n820\n\n840\n\n860\n\n880\n\n900\n\n920\n\n940\n\n960\n\n980\n\n1000\n\n1020\n\n1040\n\n1060\n(days)Recurrence (Repeat cycle)\n\nInclination (deg)\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n760\n\n770\n\n780\n\n790\n\n800\n\n810\n\n820\n\n830\n\n840\n\n850\n\n860\n\n870\n\n880\n\n890\n\n900\n\n910\n\n920\n(days)Recurrence (Repeat cycle)\n\nInclination (deg)\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\n6\n\n8\n10\n121311\n\n9\n\n7\n\n1617\n\n1\n\n17\n13\n11\n9\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n16\n12\n10\n\n8\n\nFig. 11.9 :Altitude as a function of inclination for a satellite holding the same re-\n\ncurrence.

For the US Navstar/GPS system, the recurrence is based on 1 day\n(2 revolutions per day). For the satellites in the WEST constellation, it is also\nbased on 1 day (3 revolutions per day) (see Table 11.8).\n\nIt is also extremely useful for HEO communications satellites to have 1-day\nrecurrence cycles, so that they overfly ground stations (for transmission and\nreception) once or twice a day with the same viewing geometry, as exemplified\nby Molniya or Sirius (Tundra orbit). For these orbits, the apogee is fixed\nfollowing the choice of the critical inclination. Table 11.7 gives the orbital and\nrecurrence characteristics of these HEO satellites.\n\nWe have also included planned satellites in the list with existing satellites,\nand even abandoned projects when the orbit seems interesting and novel. The\norbit of Glonass R. E. (Regional Extension) is planned, as the name suggests,\nfor the regional extension of the Glonass system (see Chap. 14).\n\nAlthough associated with a quite different type of mission, it is interesting\nto note the recurrence conditions of the satellite Integral, with i ? 63?, which\nmakes one revolution in 3 days. This gives the unusual recurrence triple [0, 1,\n3], NTo = 1.\n\n\n\n11.4 Recurrence for MEO and HEO Satellites 515\n\nHEO satellite a e i T Triple NTo\n\nSupertundra 42,163.2 0.4230 ic 1,436.03 [1, 0, 1] 1\nTundra 42,163.4 0.2668 ic 1,436.04 [1, 0, 1] 1\nSycomores 42,163.9 0.3458 ic 1,436.07 [1, 0, 1] 1\nGlonass R.

Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\n11.5 Recurrence Grid\n\n11.5.1 Constructing the Recurrence Grid\n\nEquatorial Shift\n\nAs we saw in Chap. 8, the equatorial shift ??E represents the distance\nbetween two successive ground tracks (of the same kind, ascending or de-\nscending) at the equator. In the following, we consider near-circular satellites\nin low orbit (LEO), the only ones for which the recurrence grid is relevant.\nFor the quantities already discussed, we have\n\n??E = ?(??T ? ??)Td = ?\nnd\n?\nTd = ?\n\n2?\n\n?\n. (11.17)\n\nThe equatorial shift is thus very simply related to the daily recurrence fre-\nquency ?.\n\nConsider a ground track defining one ascending node as origin, with longi-\ntude ?0. If ?1 is the longitude of the following ascending node, we thus have,\nby definition of the equatorial shift,\n\n?1 ? ?0 = ??E = ?2?\nCTo\nNTo\n\n. (11.18)\n\nAfter ?o revolutions (about 1 day), the ground track cuts the equator at the\nascending node with longitude ??o such that\n\n??o ? ?0 = ?o??E = ?2?\n?oCTo\nNTo\n\n.\n\nAccording to (11.12), this can be written in the form\n\n??o ? ?0 = ?2?\n(\n1? DTo\n\nNTo\n\n)\n= ?2? + 2?DTo\n\nNTo\n.\n\nSince the longitudes are defined to within 2?, we thus have\n\n??o ? ?0 = 2?\nDTo\nNTo\n\n. (11.19)\n\nIf DTo is positive, i.e., if ?o < ?, we have ??o ? ?0 > 0, whence ??o lies to the\neast of ?0. Indeed, if after ?o revolutions a whole day has not gone by since\nthe crossing at ?0, the ground track ??o is indeed to the east of ?0.\n\nIn the opposite situation, if DTo is negative, i.e., if ?o > ?, a little more\nthan 1 day has gone by and the ground track ??o is situated west of ?0, as is\nclearly shown by the relation ??o ? ?0 < 0.\n\n\n\n11.5 Recurrence Grid 517\n\n11.5.2 Grid Interval\n\nIn the rest of this calculation, we shall denote the day of crossing by a\nsuperscript and the number of the crossing in this day by a subscript on the\nlongitude of the ascending node, viz.,\n\n?daycrossing .\n\nThe origin is denoted by ?00. We consider the case where DTo is positive for\nconcreteness. The other case would require us to use ?o + 1 rather than ?o\nand change some of the signs. We thus have, with this notation,\n\n?01 ? ?00 = ??E .\n\nThe last ascending node on day 0 is ?0?o , and the next, which is the first on\nday 1, is written ?11. Hence,\n\n?0?o ? ?00 = ?o??E [mod 2?] ,\n?11 ? ?00 = (?o + 1)??E [mod 2?] .\n\nwhere [mod 2?] indicates congruence modulo 2?.\nWe now consider the interval [?01, ?\n\n0\n0], which we shall call the base interval,\n\nor intertrack interval, counting positively toward the east. We take ?01 as origin\nand set\n\n?R = ?\n0\n0 ? ?01 , ?D = ?11 ? ?01 ,\n\nwhere ?R is the interval between ascending nodes for two consecutive revolu-\ntions, so that ?R = ???E, and ?D is the interval between ascending nodes for\n2 consecutive days. The interval ?R is shown in Fig. 11.11a, b, and the interval\n?D in Fig. 11.11b, c.\n\nCalling ? the grid interval at the equator, defined by\n\n? =\n2?\n\nNTo\n, (11.20)\n\nwe have the relations\n\n?R = CTo? , ?D = DTo? .\n\nThe grid interval5 ?, related in this way to ?R and ?D, is indicated in\nFig. 11.11d.\n\n5For a quick evaluation, ? can be obtained from an approximate relation for recurrent\nsatellites of altitude h = 900 \u00b1 300 km. For these satellites, the daily orbital frequency ?\nlies between 13 and 15. We may thus take ? to be equal to 14 and NTo equal to 14CTo .\nExpressing ? in degrees, we then find that\n\n? ? 360\n14CTo\n\n, i.e., CTo? ? 25 .\n\nWe thus see that the product of the grid interval (in degrees) and the recurrence cycle (in\ndays) is roughly equal to 25.\n\n\n\n518 Chapter 11.

(a) Two consecutive ground tracks from\n\nday 0 determine the base interval ??E, denoted here by ?R. These ground tracks are\n\nplotted in bold type. (b) One ground track of day 1 passes through the base interval.\n\n(c) The ground tracks for the following days 2, 3, . . . , D pass through the base\n\ninterval. (d) All ground tracks up to day CTo ? 1 define the grid interval. Note that,\nby \u201cground track\u201d, we understand the ground track at the ascending node.\n\nIn the base interval, we have for the different days:\n\nfor day 1 ?11 ? ?01 = ?D ,\nfor day 2 ?21 ? ?01 = 2?D ,\nfor day D ?D1 ? ?01 = D?D .\n\nFor day D, this relation holds if the point ?D1 lies in the base interval. Oth-\nerwise, we subtract a whole number of multiples of ?R, expressing this by\ncongruence relations:\n\n?D1 ? ?01 = D?D [mod ?R] ,\n?D1 ? ?01 = DDTo? [mod CTo?] ,\n?D1 ? ?01\n\n?\n= DDTo [mod CTo ] .\n\nWe note that the quantity (?D1 ? ?01)/? is indeed a whole number. So for\na given day, we obtain the position of the ascending node ?D1 in the base\ninterval, hence also in the recurrence grid.\n\n\n\n11.5 Recurrence Grid 519\n\nIf u(D) denotes the position of the ground track on day D in the base\ninterval, in units of ?, i.e.,\n\nu(D) =\n?D1 ? ?01\n\n?\n, (11.21)\n\nwe have the fundamental relation for the recurrence grid:\n\nu(D) = DDTo [mod CTo ] . (11.22)\n\nThe whole number u(D) can take CTo values between 0 and CTo ? 1.\nWhen we do not wish to favour one bound of the interval rather than the\n\nother, we will consider the number u?(D) defined by\n\nu?(D) = min\n{\nu(D), CTo ? u(D)\n\n}\n, (11.23)\n\nwhich is an integer taking values between 0 and CTo/2.\n\nUsing the Recurrence Grid\n\nWe now give several examples to show how the recurrence grid is deter-\nmined and used.\n\nExample 11.7 Calculate the crossing order in the base interval for the satel-\nlites TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 and -2.\n\n? The recurrence triple of these satellites is [13, ?3, 10], which immediately\ngives NTo = 127. We thus have\n\n? =\n2?\n\n127\n= 0.049474 rad = 2.8346? = 315.551 km ,\n\nand equatorial shift ?R = 10?, or ?R = 28.35\n?. Applying (11.22), we obtain\n\nthe values of u(D) for each day of the cycle. We deduce the grid values in the\nbase interval, from u = 0 to u = 10, noting the value of D for each u :\n\nfrom u = 0 to u = 10 ??? 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 10 = 0 .\n\nNote that u? = 1 for J = 3 and J = 7. It is easy to obtain these values\ngraphically, as illustrated in Fig. 11.12. ?\n\nExample 11.8 Calculate the crossing order in the base interval for the satel-\nlites Landsat-3 and ADEOS-2.\n\n? All recurrent satellites with DTo = \u00b11 have sequential recurrence grids,\ni.e., in the base interval, consecutive ground tracks occur in the order of the\ndays. Indeed, in this case, (11.22) implies the simple relation\n\nDTo = +1 =? u(D) = D , DTo = ?1 =? u(D) = CTo ?D .\n\n\n\n520 Chapter 11.

For each day of the cycle (D = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . ), the\n\nground track at the equator is marked in the base interval.\n\nThere are many satellites like this, as can be seen in Table 11.1. Later on,\nwe shall discover the important consequences of this fact for the ground track\nduring the recurrence cycle. For Landsat-3, with DTo = ?1 for an 18 day\ncycle, the various ground tracks u = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , 17, 18, occur on days\nD = 18 (= 0), 17, 16, 15, . . . , 1, 0. For ADEOS-2, with DTo = +1 for a 4 day\ncycle, the various ground tracks u = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 occur on days D = 0, 1, 2,\n3, 4. ?\n\n11.5.3 Recurrence Subcycle\n\nDefinition of the Subcycle\n\nConsider a day origin D = 0. A subcycle ETo is then the number of days\nrequired for the ground track to pass at a grid interval ? from the ascending\nnode origin. This can be formulated as follows:\n\nu(ETo) = \u00b11 [mod CTo ] , (11.24)\n\nor by\n\nEToDTo = \u00b11 [mod CTo ] , (11.25)\n\nor again, bringing in the distance u?, by\n\nu?(ETo ) = 1 . (11.26)\n\n\n\n11.5 Recurrence Grid 521\n\nThis gives two values for ETo . If E\n?\nTo\n\nis the smallest of the two, we have\n\nETo = E\n?\nTo , ETo = CTo ? E\n\n?\nTo .\n\nWe give several values for the subcycles of satellites discussed earlier.\n\nImportant Note. Care must be taken not to confuse the two quantities DTo\nand E?To . For the SPOT satellites, often described in the literature, it happens\nthat DTo = 5 and E\n\n?\nTo\n\n= 5. However, it should not be concluded that DTo\nrepresents a subcycle, contrary to what is often claimed. It is quite clear in\nExample 11.9 that, for ADEOS-1, these two quantities are different, since we\nhave DTo = 11 and E\n\n?\nTo\n\n= 15.\n\nExample 11.9 Recurrence subcycles for various satellites with environmental\nmissions.\n\n? Here we calculate E?To for several satellites:\n\n\u2022 For SPOT-5, as for the SPOT-1 to -4 satellites, we obtain E?To = 5:\n\nE?ToDTo = 5\u00d7 5 = 25 = ?1 [mod 26] .\n\nThis means that, 5 days before (D = ?5 [mod 26] = 21) or 5 days after\n(D = 5) the day origin, the ground track passes at the grid interval from\nthe ground track origin.\n\n\u2022 For Terra, as for all the satellites belonging to the A-Train, we obtain\nE?To = 7:\n\nE?ToDTo = ?7\u00d7 7 = ?49 = ?1 [mod 16] .\n\nAt days D = 7 and D = 16 ? 7 = 9, the satellite is at one grid interval\nfrom the ground track origin.\n\n\u2022 For ADEOS-1, we have E?To = 15:\n\nE?ToDTo = 15\u00d7 11 = 165 = +1 [mod 41] .\n\nAt days D = 15 and D = 41? 15 = 26, the satellite is at one grid interval\nfrom the ground track origin.\n\n\u2022 For TOPEX/Poseidon, E?To = 3, whence ETo = 3 and 7 (see Fig. 11.12).\n\u2022 For ICESat, ETo = 25:\n\nE?ToDTo = 25\u00d7 (?22) = ?550 = ?1 [mod 183] .\n\nThe cycle is very long in order to obtain a very short grid interval, viz.,\n? = 14.7 km.\n\n?\n\n\n\n522 Chapter 11.

For SPOT-5, the value of the subcycle E?To = 5\nindicates that almost the whole of the base interval has been scanned in 5\ndays. However, for a satellite with E?To = 1, we see that the ground track\nremains almost at the same place in the base interval after 1 day and that we\nneed the whole cycle CTo (which can be of the order of a month) to cover the\nwhole interval. This situation is generally considered as a drawback, as can\nbe seen from the evolution of certain programmes.\n\nThe first Landsat satellites (-1, -2, and -3) had the subcycle E?To = 1. Then,\nfrom Landsat-4, the orbit was changed to obtain E?To = 5. The same happened\nwith the Indian satellites in the IRS programme: the first IRS (IRS-1A and -\n1B) were replaced from IRS-P2, with a change of subcycle (but keeping almost\nthe same cycle). This change is very clearly shown in Fig. 11.13, where we have\nplotted the ground tracks of two IRS satellites over 5 days. For IRS-1A, over\nthis time span, a fraction 5/22 or less than one quarter of the interval has been\ncovered. For IRS-P2, the whole interval has been covered. On the ground track\nof IRS-P2, in the vicinity of the origin (? = 0, ? = 0), we see the end of the\nground track for the fifth day, since in 5 days, this satellite has accomplished\n\n\n\n524 Chapter 11.

The distance between this ground track and\none going through the origin is equal to the interval ?, since E?To = 5 for this\nsatellite (Fig. 11.14).\n\nThe notion of subcycle is often used for recurrent satellites, since it is\nrather informative. It tells us that, after a certain number of days representing\nthe subcycle, the ground track passes through almost the same place, where\n\u201calmost\u201d means within the grid interval ?. However, it is just a special case\nof the notion of recurrence index to be discussed shortly.\n\n11.5.4 Reference Grids\n\nFor a recurrent satellite, a single point on the ground track completely fixes\nits ground track on the globe. Earth-observation satellites are maintained on\ntheir nominal orbits in order to guarantee the position of their ground tracks\nto within a few kilometers (generally \u00b15 km, but \u00b11 km for TOPEX/Poseidon\nand Jason, \u00b10.8km for ICESat). The SPOT satellites (SPOT-1 to -5), for ex-\nample, use the same grid, which is fixed by giving an ascending node longitude.\nTable 11.9 describes the main grids and their characteristics.\n\nExample 11.10 Fitting a grid to geographic circumstances: the case of\nFormoSat-2.\n\n? FormoSat-2, launched on 20 May 2004 under the name of Rocsat-2, is de-\nvoted to the study of Earth resources and meteorology, and in particular,\ntyphoon warnings. Its recurrence triple is [14, 0, 1]. This means that each\nday, after 14 round trips, it exactly repeats its ground track (see Fig. 11.15\nupper).

Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\nthe island of Taiwan, formerly Formosa, lies between latitudes 22?N and 25?N.\nThe grid can thus be fixed in such a way that the island is crossed twice a\nday by the (ascending and descending) ground track. The equatorial shift is\n?R = |??E| = 360/14 = 25.71?. By symmetry considerations, we understand\nthat the longitude of the ground track intersection and the longitude of the\nascending node must be separated by a distance equal to one quarter of the\nequatorial shift. The central longitude of Taiwan is ?C = 121.20\n\n?E, which\nimplies that the ascending node must have longitude ?0 such that\n\n?0 = ?C + ?R/4 = 121.20 + 6.43 = 127.63\n?E .\n\nFigure 11.15 illustrates this situation, unique for an LEO satellite. ?\n\n11.5.5 Grid Points for Recurrent Satellites\n\nWhen a satellite is recurrent, its ground track forms a grid fixed on the\nEarth (the reference grid discussed above). A grid point is any place where\ntwo ground tracks intersect, one in the ascending part and the other in the\ndescending part. For satellites with a broad swath, these points are of little\ninterest. However, if the swath happens to be very narrow, or in the case of\nnadir laser sighting, it is generally extremely useful to know their positions.\n\nAt a given latitude, these points are regularly arranged in longitude. As one\nmoves away from the equator, they become more and more closely spaced. We\ncalculate the positions of the grid points using a cartographic method. We saw\nin Chap. 8, and in particular in Sect. 8.5 on cartographic projections, that the\nsatellite ground track can be represented linearly using a Snyder projection.\n\nConsider therefore the cartographic projection defined by (8.56), with\nCartesian coordinates x as abscissa and y as ordinate. For clarity, and without\nloss of generality, we only consider here the quarter (x ? 0, y ? 0) of the map.\nThe rest can be deduced by symmetry relative to the equator for y ? 0 and\nrelative to the zero meridian for x ? 0. Moreover, we set ?AN = 0. Then,{\n\nx = ? ,\ny = F(?) ,\n\n(11.27)\n\nwith\n\nF(?) =\n\n????arcsin tan?tan i ?\n1\n\n?\narcsin\n\nsin?\n\nsin i\n\n???? . (11.28)\nWith this cartographic projection, the ground track of the satellite is made\nup of straight line segments. The recurrence grid looks like a series of identical\ndiamonds lying between the northernmost (geocentric) latitude +?m and the\nsouthernmost (geocentric) latitude ??m.\n\n\n\n11.5 Recurrence Grid 527\n\nWe can calculate the maximal value ym of y, when ? = ?m :\n\n\u2022 If i < 90?, ?m = i =? ym = 90(1? 1/?) .\n\u2022 If i > 90?, ?m = 180? ? i =? ym = 90(1 + 1/?) .\n\nThis can be summarised by\n\nym = 90\n(\n1? ?\n\n?\n\n)\n, (11.29)\n\nwhere ? = sign(cos i).\n\nNote. This method cannot be applied if sign(cos i) and sign(cos i?) are not\nequal, where i? is the apparent inclination. However, this situation never arises\nwith existing recurrent LEO satellites.\n\nExamples: for Jason-2, ym = 82.9134, and for Oceansat-2, ym = 96.2069.\nDuring one cycle of NTo revolutions in CTo days, the satellite crosses a\n\ngiven meridian M times:\n\n\u2022 For a direct orbit, i < 90?, the satellite and the Earth rotate in the same\ndirection and therefore M = NTo ? CTo .\n\n\u2022 For a retrograde orbit, i > 90?, the satellite and the Earth rotate in opposite\ndirections, whence M = NTo + CTo .\n\nThe numberM of intersections between the ground track and the given merid-\nian can be summarised by the formula\n\nM = NTo ? ? CTo . (11.30)\n\nFor example, for Jason-2, M = 127 ? 10 = 117, and for Oceansat-2, M =\n29 + 2 = 31.\n\nThe length Ly of the \u201cvertical\u201d diagonal, along the y axis, of an elementary\ndiamond is expressed as\n\nLy = 4u ,\n\nwhere u is our measurement unit. TheM intersections produceM/2 diamonds\n(M even or odd), which appear clearly in Fig. 11.16 (upper). Along the y axis,\nthe diamonds cover a total length L given by\n\nL =\nM\n\n2\nLy = 2uM .\n\nThis distance L corresponds to the interval [?ym,+ym], of length 2ym. We\nthus deduce that u is equal to\n\nu =\nym\nM\n\n.\n\n\n\n528 Chapter 11.

CTo\nNTo\n\nNTo ? ?CTo\n,\n\nwhence the value of the unit u is\n\nu =\n90\n\nNTo\n. (11.31)\n\nWe now consider the intersections of the ground track with the equator. In\none cycle of NTo revolutions, there will be 2NTo intersections. Since these\nare regularly distributed, there will thus be NTo diamond shapes along the x\naxis. So if Lx is the \u201chorizontal\u201d length, along the x axis, of an elementary\ndiamond, and if we set Lx = 4v, we obtain\n\nv =\n90\n\nNTo\n.\n\nThen since\n\nu = v ,\n\nwe conclude that the units of length along the x and y axes are the same.\nThis is a direct consequence of the choice of projection.\n\nHaving defined u in this way, the ordinates of the grid points are as follows:\n\n{\nM even =? y/u = 0, 2, 4, 6, . . . ,M ,\nM odd =? y/u = 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . ,M . (11.32)\n\nStarting from the equator, we number the latitudes of the grid points:\n\ngrid point j ??\n\n????\n???\n\nordinate yj ?? latitude ?j ,\n\nyj =\nj\n\nM\nym ,\n\n0 ? j ?

(11.33)\n\nThe function F is analytic, and F?1 can be found numerically.\nFor each grid point j, we thus obtain the geocentric latitude ?j , hereafter\n\ndenoted by ?. It corresponds to the geocentric latitude of the satellite or its\ngeocentric ground track T . From each value of ?, we calculate the geodetic\nlatitude ? of the nadir using the method described in Chap. 2 (see Fig. 2.5 and\n\n\n\n530 Chapter 11.

From 1960, the USSR began to develop intensive cotton production in\nUzbekistan and Kazakhstan. To sustain this, enormous amounts of water were\nextracted from the two rivers flowing into the Aral Sea, the Syr Darya in the\nnorth and the Amu Darya in the south. Water levels in this closed sea began\nto drop and its area was significantly reduced until, in 1989, it divided into\ntwo basins, the Greater Sea, or Big Aral Sea, and the Lesser Sea, or Little\nAral Sea (see Fig. 11.17 lower). But draining continued and the Greater Sea\nitself soon split into two.\n\nMeasuring the water levels in the Aral Sea is an interesting application for\nan altimetric satellite like TOPEX/Poseidon and its successors Jason-1 and\n-2. Here we calculate the position of a grid point located in the middle of the\nAral Sea and denoted by A in Fig. 11.17 (upper):\n\n\u2022 Latitude. The original \u201chistorical\u201d sea lies between latitudes 43.5?N and\n47?N. For T/P, CTo = 10 day, NTo = 127, i = 66.0390?, so M = 127?10 =\n117. Solving (11.33), we obtain for j = 31 the value ? = ?j = 44.5197\n\n?. We\nthen calculate the geodetic latitude of the nadir, which gives ? = 44.6785?.\n\n\u2022 Longitude. The region under consideration lies between longitudes 58?E\nand 62?E. The ascending node fixing the grid is ?0 = 99.9242?. The unit\nof length of the diamond is v = 90/127 = 0.7087. Since M is odd, the grid\npoints have longitudes of the form\n\n?k = ?0 + kv with k odd, between 0 and 4NTo ,\n\nwhence\n\n?k = 99.9242 +\n90\n\n127\nk with k odd, between 1 and 507 .\n\nWith k = 451, we obtain\n\n? = 99.9242+ 319.6063 = 59.5305 [mod 360] .\n\nThe coordinates of the grid point at the center of the Aral sea, denoted by\nA on the map in Fig. 11.17 (upper), are therefore 44.6785?N and 59.5305?E.\n\n?\n\n\n\n532 Chapter 11.

One speaks of orbital maintenance: the orbital\nelements must be repositioned at the required values whenever necessary. The\ninclination i and the eccentricity e vary little, compared with the semi-major\naxis a, which must be watched over very carefully. Here we shall only consider\nthe variation of a.\n\nThe altitude of the satellite tends to drop, mainly due to atmospheric drag\nand solar radiation pressure. The differential form of Kepler\u2019s third law gives\n\ndT =\n3\n\n2\n\nT\n\na\nda .\n\nLet ?a be the deviation of the semi-major axis from its nominal value (with\n?a ? a). The period of the satellite varies by ?T . After one revolution, with\nperiod T +?T , the Earth\u2019s rotation leads to a shift ?? in the ground track\nof the satellite at the equator as compared with its nominal ground track. We\ndenote this shift by ??1 for one revolution, and by ??D for 1 day. Using (8.17)\nand taking into account nodal precession, we obtain\n\n??1 = ?R(??T ? ??)?T = ?\n3\n\n2\nR(??T ? ??)Td\n\n?a\n\na\n, (11.34)\n\nwhere R is the equatorial radius. Using (11.17), we then have\n\n??1 = ?3?R\n1\n\n?\n\n?a\n\na\n. (11.35)\n\nNote that ??1 and ?a have opposite signs:\n\n\u2022 If h ?, then ?a > 0 =? ??1 < 0, leading to a westward shift.\n\u2022 If h ?, then ?a < 0 =? ??1 > 0, leading to an eastward shift.\n\nIn 1 day, the shift will be\n\n??D = ???1 , (11.36)\n\nand with (11.9),\n\n??D = ?3?R\n?\n\n?\n\n?a\n\na\n= ?3?R?a\n\na\n\n(\n1? 1\n\nCS\n\n)\n. (11.37)\n\nThe daily shift ??D can be written in the following simplified form, using the\nreduced distance ? and neglecting the term in 1/CS compared with 1:\n\n??D = ?Q?a , where Q =\n3?\n\n?\n. (11.38)\n\nThe factor Q, which we may call the drift coefficient, is thus a dimensionless\nnumber by which one must multiply the change in altitude to obtain the daily\n\n\n\n534 Chapter 11. Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\nshift of the ground track away from its nominal position at the equator. For\ntypical Sun-synchronous LEO satellites with ? ? 1.11, one has\n\nQ = 8.5 .\n\nFor example, if a maneuver raises the satellite by 10m, the ground track will\nshift by 85m every day, provided that a remains the same after the maneuver.\n\nExample 11.12 Orbital maintenance for the altimetric satellite TOPEX-\nPoseidon.\n\n? We compare the actual and theoretical positions of the ground track for the\nsatellites TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 and -2.\n\nOrbital Maintenance Maneuvers. To ensure that the deviation from the\nnominal ground track is never greater than 1 km at the equator, the satellite is\nsubjected to orbital maintenance maneuvers (OMM) 2 or 3 times a year. The\naltitude is thereby raised slightly, by 5\u201310m above the nominal altitude, by\nactivating the satellite thrusters for 3\u20134 s. Figure 11.18 shows the changes ??\nas time goes by, relating them to changes ?a, over the 7 years of operation of\nTOPEX/Poseidon. The ground track shifts westward relative to the nominal\nground track when the semi-major axis a decreases.\n\nTo calculate the drift of the ground track, we take the example of the\nthird maneuver OMM3 on 30 March 1993. By this maneuver, a changed from\n7,714.426 to 7,714.435km, thereby increasing by 9m. Subsequently, for 26\ndays, a decreased steadily to 7,714.430, i.e., 4m above its value at the begin-\nning of the maneuver. We may thus consider an average value of ?a = 6.5m\nduring this period. The numerical data for T/P are ? = 1.2095, ? = 12.70,\n? = 12.81, which we use in (11.37) to obtain\n\n??D = ?7.86?a = 51.1m .\n\nOver 26 days, ?? = 1.33km, as can be read off the graph.\n\nReference Grid. In Example 11.6, we calculated ?AN at a given revolution\nfor each of the 3 satellites. We see also from Table 11.9 that the zero longi-\ntude of the TPG grid is ?0 = 99.9242\n\n?. The difference between the nominal\nlongitude ?0AN of the ascending node and ?0 is equal to a whole number of\ngrid intervals ? :\n\n?0AN ? ?0 = k\n360\n\n127\n, k integer .\n\n\n\n11.6 Maintaining a Recurrent Satellite on Orbit 535\n\nFig. 11.18 :(continued)\n\n\n\n536 Chapter 11.

When Jason-1\ncame into operation on 15 August 2002, T/P became a secondary satellite.\nBy shifting T/P to a longitude at the equator exactly equal to ?/2, a tandem\nmission was set up which amounted to working with a recurrence grid that\nwas twice as fine. When Jason-2 become operational on 20 February 2009, it\nwas Jason-1 that became the secondary satellite for the tandem mission, on\n20 February 2009, and T/P was withdrawn from service. ?\n\n11.7 Recurrence Index\n\n11.7.1 Definition of Recurrence Index\n\nConsider a day origin D = 0 and its base interval, representing the inter-\ntrack distance, defined by ?01 and ?\n\n0\n0, which are separated by the equatorial\n\nshift ?R. The ascending node crossing in this interval on a given day D deter-\nmines an ascending node of longitude ?D1 , as discussed above. The distance\nbetween ?D1 and the bounds ?\n\n0\n1 and ?\n\n0\n0 will be representative of the recur-\n\nrence conditions. If the distance to one of the two bounds is zero, this means\nthat the ground track passes once again through a certain point, and we have\nrecurrence with a cycle of D days, or else D is a multiple of the cycle. If the\ndistance is small compared with the length of the interval, we may be in a\nsituation with a subcycle.\n\n?\nFig. 11.18 :Deviations ?? from the nominal ground track resulting from deviations\n\n?a from the nominal semi-major axis over the 7 year period of operation of\n\nTOPEX/Poseidon (1993\u20131999).

(11.39)\n\nFrom (11.21), we then have\n\nv(D) =\nu(D)\n\nCTo\n. (11.40)\n\nThese two equivalent definitions shown that v(D) is a real number between 0\nand 1, representing a relative distance.\n\nJust as we defined u?(D) by (11.23), we now define v?(D) as the smallest\nof the two relative distances v(D) from the ground track to one or other of\nthe bounds, viz.,\n\nv?(D) = min\n{\n?01 ? ?D1\n?01 ? ?00\n\n,\n?D1 ? ?00\n?01 ? ?00\n\n}\n, (11.41)\n\nor\n\nv?(D) = min\n{\nv(D) , 1? v(D)\n\n}\n=\n\nu?(D)\nCTo\n\n, (11.42)\n\nwhence\n\nv?(D) = D\n?\n\n?R\n= D\n\n|DTo |\nCTo\n\n. (11.43)\n\nWe shall call this the relative recurrence distance. It lies between 0 and 0.5.\nWe thus have:\n\n\u2022 v?(D) = 0, for a recurrence cycle of D days,\n\u2022 v?(D) = 1/CTo , for a recurrence subcycle,\n\u2022 v?(D) = 2/CTo , for a ground track passing at 2? from a bound,\n\nand so on.\nTo obtain a function of D which increases as we approach recurrence con-\n\nditions, we define the function ?(D) which is simply the reciprocal of v?(D),\ni.e.,\n\n?(D) =\n1\n\nv?(D)\n. (11.44)\n\nWe shall call this function the recurrence index. It is a dimensionless quantity.\nWe now have\n\n\u2022 ?(D) = ? =? recurrence cycle of D days ,\n\u2022 ?(D) = CTo =? recurrence subcycle for D ,\n\u2022 ?(D) = CTo/2 =? ground track passing 2? from a bound ,\n\n\n\n538 Chapter 11. Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\n\u2022 ?(D) = CTo/3 =? ground track passing 3? from a bound ,\n\u2022 other cases,\n\u2022 ?(D) > 2 in every case.\n\nThis index provides a useful way of specifying cycles, subcycles, and other\nquantities related to recurrence for any satellite, whether it is intentionally\nrecurrent or not.\n\n11.7.2 Perfect or Imperfect Recurrence\n\nThe methods discussed above concern satellites with known recurrence ele-\nments. They allow one to find the orbital characteristics from these elements.\nHowever, we may encounter another type of problem: given the orbit of a\nsatellite, we may wish to find its recurrence cycle. For this satellite, h and i\nare known, so P and ? are determined, and hence also ?.\n\nThe day D corresponding to the recurrence cycle CTo will be such that the\nproduct ?D is closest to a whole number. It will therefore be the day giving\nthe highest value of the recurrence index ?(D), which we shall write ?m.\n\nIndeed, considering the expression (11.12) for ? as a function of the recur-\nrence triple, the product ?D is\n\n?D = D?o +D\nDTo\nCTo\n\n,\n\nand since D?o is an integer, we have\n\nfractional part of |?D| = v(D) ,\n\nwhich implies that\n\ndistance between |?D| and the nearest integer = v?(D) .\n\nIf ?m is infinite, the satellite is recurrent, i.e., perfectly recurrent (and hence\nprobably deliberately recurrent). If ?m is not infinite, the recurrence is said\nto be imperfect.\n\nWhen we seek the recurrence characteristics from the orbital elements, the\nrecurrence may turn out to be imperfect, and in this case, the quantities u(D)\nand u?(D) are not whole numbers.\n\n11.7.3 Applications of the Recurrence Index\n\nWe shall now give several example applications to show how the recurrence\nindex is used, where ?(D) is recorded over a period of several months. The keys\nto the graphs carry the orbital characteristics of the satellite, the values of the\ncycle, with the maximal recurrence index, which shows whether recurrence is\nperfect or not, and the two basic quantities in this analysis, namely, the daily\norbital frequency ? and the daily recurrence frequency ?.\n\n\n\n11.7 Recurrence Index 539\n\nThe graphs clearly show the cycles and the subcycles which stand out to\nvarying degrees. It is also very easy to distinguish those satellites that are\ndeliberately recurrent from those with a certain level of recurrence but which\nhave not been intentionally attributed any recurrent behaviour.\n\nExample 11.13 Examples of the recurrence index for Sun-synchronous and\nnon-Sun-synchronous satellites.\n\n? Unless otherwise mentioned, the satellites are Sun-synchronous and recur-\nrence is intended.\n\n\u2022 Change of subcycle leading to more rapid coverage of the base interval. We\nindicated earlier how, for the Landsat and IRS satellites, a modification\nof the subcycle DTo radically changed the way in which the base interval\nwas covered. For IRS-1A and IRS-P2, shown in Fig. 11.13, the graph of\nthe recurrence index in Fig. 11.14 illustrates this change. For IRS-1A, the\nground track moves steadily across the base interval in 22 days. For IRS-\nP2, the ground track approaches the initial ground track on four occasions\nduring the 24 day cycle, on days D = 5, 10, 14, and 19, or roughly every\n5 days.\n\n\u2022 Recurrence index for satellites in the SPOT and Terra families. These two\nfamilies of remote-sensing satellites include a great many satellites, whose\nrecurrence index is shown in Fig. 11.19. For SPOT, the index has 4 peaks\nin the 26 day cycle, on days D = 5, 10, 16, and 21, indicating a passage\nvery close to the initial ground track roughly every 5 days. For Terra, there\nare two main peaks in the 16 day cycle, for days D = 7 and 9.\n\n\u2022 Recurrence index for a satellite with very long cycle. The satellite ADEOS-1\nhas a relatively long recurrence cycle, with CTo = 41 days. The recurrence\nindex is shown in Fig. 11.20 (upper). Referring to Example 11.9, we see\nthat the two main intermediate peaks, for D = 15 and 26, correspond to\nu? = 1, the next two, for D = 11 and 30, correspond to u? = 2, and so on.\n\n\u2022 Recurrence index for a non-Sun-synchronous satellite. The non-Sun-\nsynchronous satellite TOPEX/Poseidon has the short recurrence cycle\nCTo = 10 days, with two peaks for D = 3 and 7 days (see Fig. 11.20 center).\nWe note that ? and ? have different values: the cycle takes CT = 9.916 days.\nFor ICESat, below the subcycle D = 25, there are two peaks at D = 8 and\nD = 15. The base interval is almost swept out in 8 days.\n\n\u2022 Recurrence index for a satellite with very long recurrence cycle. Like all\nsatellites engaged in systematically mapping a planet, the recurrence cycle\nwill be very long because the swath of the main instrument will be very nar-\nrow. The satellite Z-Earth has a cycle of 274 days, with 4,149 revolutions.\nIt has a subcycle of 7 days over 106 revolutions, which clearly shows on\nthe graph of the recurrence index in Fig. 11.20 (lower). The horizontal axis\ngoes up to 180 days and the maximum at 274 days is not therefore visi-\n\n\n\n540 Chapter 11.

The recurrence index reveals this very clearly. The following three exam-\nples show how a change in altitude of a few hundred meters can completely\nchange the recurrence characteristics after a few weeks. Precisely recurrent\nsatellites are moved back onto the nominal orbit as soon as the altitude varies\nby a fraction of a kilometer. This maneuver is required between one and four\ntimes a month.\n\nExample 11.14 Recurrence index for the Sun-synchronous satellite Earth-\nCARE.\n\n\n\n11.7 Recurrence Index 541\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n days\n\nR\nec\n\nur\nre\n\nnc\ne \n\nin\nde\n\nx\n\nADEOS-1\n\nRecurrence cycle\n\n[  14;   11;   41  ]   41.000\n\nAltitude =  796.768 km\n\nIncl. / Sun-s.= 98.61 \u00b0\n\nEquatorial shift=  2808.7 km\n\nPeriod =   100.92 min\n\n = 14.2683\n\na = 7174.904 km EGM2008\n\nCycle : 41.00 days\n\n=>  on  585 round trips\n\nMax.

Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\n? The satellite EarthCARE will first be launched into the orbit denoted by\nEarthCARE [3a] in Table 11.3, which is the calibration orbit EarthCARE\n[cal]. Its altitude will subsequently be reduced by 1.294km to join the mission\norbit EarthCARE, denoted by EarthCARE [3b] in the table.\nFigure 11.21 shows how the recurrence cycle goes from 9 days (blue) to 25\ndays (red) as a result of this change in altitude. ?\n\nExample 11.15 Recurrence index and altitude variations for SPOT-5.\n\n? Consider a Sun-synchronous satellite of the SPOT-5 type, with recurrence\ntriple [14, 5, 26]. The recurrence index is plotted for various altitudes in\nFig. 11.22 (upper) which graphs the function ?(D,?h). For ?h = 0, i.e.,\nfor the value of the altitude giving the required recurrence, we see that the\nmain peaks occur for values of D that are multiples of CTo = 26 days. The sec-\nondary peaks are clearly visible 5 days before and after the main peak. They\nbecome the main peaks for neighbouring altitudes. The recurrence triple [14,\n5, 26], for ?h = 0, becomes [14, 4, 21] for ?h = +0.6 km and [14, 3, 16]\nfor ?h = +1.6 km. Reducing the altitude, this initial recurrence behaviour\nbecomes [14, 6, 31] for ?h = ?0.4 km, [14, 7, 36] for ?h = ?0.7km, [14, 8,\n41] for ?h = ?1.0 km, and so on. ?\n\nExample 11.16 Recurrence index and altitude variations for ERS-1.\n\n? We return to the Sun-synchronous satellite ERS-1, which has had three\ndifferent recurrence cycles, as discussed in Example 11.3. The reference alti-\ntude will be taken to be the one for Recurrence Cycle 2, the 3 day cycle. This\ncycle appears for ?h = 0 in Fig. 11.22 (lower). If we increase the altitude,\nwith ?h = +6.358km, we obtain Recurrence Cycle 1, the 35 day cycle. If we\nreduce the altitude, with ?h = ?5.936km, we obtain Recurrence Cycle 3, the\n168 day cycle. ?\n\n11.8 Altitude Variations\n\nThe following analysis of altitude and frozen orbits is valid for any type of\norbit, but only proves useful for near-circular LEO orbits. If the orbit is not\nclose to circular, the altitude variations of the satellite during its revolutions\nare due to the eccentricity of the orbit, compared with which the flattening\nof the Earth is negligible. For MEO satellites, the altitude is not the relevant\nquantity. The same is true for GEO satellites, where the altitude is constant\nin time, since the satellite is stationary.\n\n\n\n11.8 Altitude Variations 543\n\n90 95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n days\n\n days\n\nR\nec\n\nur\nre\n\nnc\ne \n\nin\nde\n\nx\nR\n\nec\nur\n\nre\nnc\n\ne \nin\n\nde\nx\n\nEarthCARE\n\nRecurrence cycle\n\n[  16;  -11;   25  ]   25.000\n\n{\nAltitude =  393.140 km\nIncl. / Sun-s.= 97.03 \u00b0\nEquatorial shift=  2575.5 km\nPeriod =    92.54 min\n? = 15.5600\n\na = 6771.276 km EGM2008\nCycle : 25.00 days \n=>  on  389 round trips\nMax.

However, it will be important\nin the following chapters, when we study the way in which the instruments\naboard the satellite observe the Earth, i.e., how they \u201csee\u201d it from a certain\nheight.\n\nThe altitude of the satellite is found from the difference between the ra-\ndius vector r(a, e, v) defining the position of the satellite, as given by (4.40)\nand (4.58), and the Earth radius RT(?) for the corresponding geocentric lati-\ntude ?, treating the Earth as an ellipsoid of revolution with flattening f . This\nvalue RT(?) is given by (1.37), in which R? represents RT(?) and where the\nsemi-major axis a of the ellipse is taken equal to the equatorial radius R. We\nnote that, with this definition, the altitude does not take into account the\nrelief of the Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nWhen we work with quantities relating to both the position of the satellite\nand the terrestrial latitude, calculations are carried out with the geocentric\n\n\n\n?2\n?1.5\n\n?1\n?0.5\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\n1.5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nAltitude variation (km)\n\nDays\n\n?10 ?5\n0 5\n\n10\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nAltitude variation (km) \n\nDays\n\nFig. 11.22 :Recurrence index ?(J,?h) as a function of the day D and the change in\n\naltitude ?h. The value ? infinite is shown as 1,000. Upper: satellite with the charac-\n\nteristics of SPOT-5. Lower: satellite with the characteristics of ERS-1.

The altitude studied here is the one we defined as the geocentric\naltitude in Chap. 2. For LEO satellites, the difference with the geodetic alti-\ntude at the nadir is negligible, being just 1 or 2m [see (2.37)].\n\nWe thus write the altitude h of the satellite in the form\n\nh = r(a, e, v)?RT(?) . (11.45)\n\nThe latitude ? is related to (i, ?, v) by (6.65) and we obtain h in the form\n\nh = h(a, e, i, ?, v) . (11.46)\n\nThe altitude is thus written as a function of five orbital elements. The element\n? is not involved, since the terrestrial longitude is irrelevant here. This is the\ncase already discussed in relation to (6.66).\n\nThe variation of the altitude is shown schematically in Fig. 11.23. In this\nfigure, the axis Ox lies in the equatorial plane of the Earth, and the axis Oz\nis the polar axis. The difference between the two semi-axes of the ellipse rep-\nresenting the Earth is 21.3 km (see Example 2.1). The trajectory represented\nis that of a satellite in low, strictly polar orbit, with perigee over the North\nPole (? = 90?). For an eccentricity of the order of 10?3, the distance FC\nbetween the focus F of the ellipse (center of attraction, center of the Earth)\nand the center C of the ellipse, equal to ae, is of the order of 8 km. The orbit\nis near-circular.\n\nFor a given revolution, we consider in (11.46) the mean values of the orbital\nelements a, e, i, and ?. Instead of v, we have chosen ? to determine the\nposition of the satellite on its orbit. We have already seen in (5.4) that this\nangle ? = ? + v specifies the position of the satellite as measured from the\nascending node.\n\nThe altitude h is thus expressed in terms of the position on orbit (argument\nof the latitude) ? by\n\nh(?) = r(?) ?RT(?) , (11.47)\n\nr(?) = r[a, e, v(?, ?)] =\na(1? e2)\n1 + e cos v\n\n, (11.48)\n\nRT(?) = RT[R, f, ?(i, ?)] =\nR?\n\ncos2 ? +\nsin2 ?\n\n(1 ? f)2\n\n, (11.49)\n\nwith\n\nv = v(?, ?) = ?? ? , ? = ?(i, ?) = arcsin(sin i sin?) .\n\n\n\n546 Chapter 11.

The eccentricities\n\nused in the figure have been greatly exaggerated compared with the true eccentricities.\n\n11.8.2 Altitude During One Revolution\n\nDefining the function h(?) in this way, we note certain specific values of\nthe altitude: h(0) at the equator (ascending node), h(?) at the perigee, h(?)\nat the equator (descending node), and h(? + ?) at the apogee. The function\nr(?) has period 2? and amplitude ae. The function RT(?) has period ? and\nits amplitude varies between 21.3 km for polar satellites (value of the product\nRf) and 0 for equatorial satellites, since in this case, RT(?) = R for all ?.\n\nWhen we give the height of a satellite as a function of the position on orbit,\nwe must specify the revolution, or at least the day, because of the displacement\nof the perigee.\n\nFor the satellites in near-circular orbits that we are concerned with here,\nthe difference between the anomalies v and M is very small (see Figs. 4.5\n(upper) and 4.6), and we will be able to replace ? by the time t, using the\nrelation ? = 2?t/T .\n\nExample 11.17 Altitude during one revolution of four Earth-observation\nsatellites:WorldView-2, RazakSat, RapidEye-5, and Yao Gan-7.\n\n\n\n11.8 Altitude Variations 547\n\n? The metric orbit elements are practically constant over several days. How-\never, the argument of the perigee ? can change quickly (apsidal precession).\nThis is why the day and number of the revolution must be specified. We have\nused the NORAD data for 6 April 2010. The values of the orbital elements\nare indicated in the corresponding figure. For each satellite, the graphs are\ndivided into two parts:\n\n\u2022 On the lower part, the dashed curve gives\nr(?) ? r(0) ,\n\nand the continuous curve gives\n\nRT(?)?RT(0) .\n\u2022 On the upper part, we have plotted the altitude relative to the altitude at\n\nthe equator, i.e.,\n\nh(?)? h(0) ,\nwhich is the difference between the two previous curves.\n\nThe altitude at the equator is obtained from\n\nh(0) =\na(1? e2)\n1 + e cos?\n\n?R .\n\nFor easier comparison of these variations, all graphs are plotted on the same\nscale.\n\nWorldView-2. This is shown in Fig. 11.24 (upper). This Sun-synchronous\nsatellite has a particularly low eccentricity. The dashed curve representing\nvariations in r(?) ? r(0) is almost flat. Altitude variations arise mainly from\nvariations in the radius of the Earth ellipsoid.\n\nRazakSat. This is shown in Fig. 11.24 (lower). For this near-equatorial satel-\nlite, the variation in the radius of the Earth ellipsoid is almost zero. In this\ncase, the altitude is only affected by the variation r(?) ? r(0) due to the\neccentricity.\n\nRapidEye-5. This is shown in Fig. 11.25 (upper). For this Sun-synchronous\nsatellite, the variations in r(?) and RT(?) are of the same order, around\n20 km. Consequently, h(?) varies by about 40 km.\n\nYao Gan-7. This is shown in Fig. 11.25 (lower). This Sun-synchronous satel-\nlite has similar curves to the last, with a different position of the perigee. ?\n\n\n\n548 Chapter 11.

On the left, the\n\norigin of the distance scale is the equatorial crossing for the day origin (D = 200).\n\nOn the right, the scale indicates altitudes measured from the reference ellipsoid.\n\n11.8.3 Variation of the Altitude over a Long Period\n\nIf we consider the altitude over a period of several months, the elements a\nand i remain almost constant. The eccentricity e fluctuates around a central\nvalue and the argument of the perigee ? undergoes a secular variation to\nwhich one must add secondary periodic variations. The form of the altitude\nvariation h(?) over one revolution depends mainly on the value of ? and to a\nlesser extent on the value of e, as we shall show in the following example.\n\nExample 11.18 Altitude as a function of the position on orbit h(?) for the\nsatellite Okean-3, on various days of the year 1998.\n\n? The satellite Okean-O1-3, generally called Okean-3, was launched on 4 June\n1991. Figure 11.26 shows the altitude h(?) for 4 days during the year 1998,\nat intervals of 30 days: D = 200 (19 July), D = 230 (18 August), D = 260\n(17 September), D = 290 (17 October). During this 90 day period, a did not\nchange significantly from a = 7,014.051km, while i varied between 82.521?\n\nand 82.523?. The eccentricity fluctuated between 2.07\u00d710?3 and 2.47\u00d710?3.\n\n\n\n11.9 Frozen Orbits 551\n\nFor its part, the argument of the perigee varied by ?90.68?, ?103.06?, and\n?105.46? in each of the three 30 day intervals. A small, long-period variation\n(of the order of a few months) is superposed on the secular variation (pro-\nportional to the time) in ?. Calculating the mean apsidal precession rate, we\nfind\n\n?? = ?360 + 67.73? 128.53\n90\n\n= ?299.20\n90\n\n= ?3.32 deg/day .\n\nThis agrees with the value found with (7.16), which would give ?? = ?3.26\ndeg/day. We see how, for ?, the periodic variations are superposed on the\nsecular variation. The values of e(D) and ?(D) are indicated in Fig. 11.26.\nThe graphs of h(?) have been plotted for the 4 days chosen. The left-hand\nscale takes as origin the altitude at the equatorial crossing for day D = 200.\nThe right-hand scale indicates the altitude relative to the reference ellipsoid. ?\n\n11.9 Frozen Orbits\n\n11.9.1 Definition of a Frozen Orbit\n\nIn the expression for h given by (11.46), we see that the altitude of the\nsatellite relative to its given subsatellite point varies in time, very slightly\nfrom one revolution to the next, but quite significantly over a time span of\nseveral days, as we saw in Example 11.18. When we require a satellite to be\nrecurrent, with cycle CT, the aim is to obtain identical viewing conditions\nevery CT days. However, when we arrange for recurrence, it is the ground\ntrack which is fixed, not necessarily the altitude.\n\nThis may be a drawback for Earth-observation satellites, for which one\ngenerally requires the altitude to be constant for a given subsatellite point,\nfrom one crossing to the next, in order to compare the images obtained at\ndifferent dates. We would thus like to arrange for the altitude to depend\nonly on the latitude of the subsatellite point, without variation in time. If\nsuch conditions are satisfied, the orbit is said to be frozen.6 Note that the\nfreezing of an orbit is independent of its recurrence characteristics, but that,\nin practice, only recurrent satellites (whether Sun-synchronous or otherwise)\nhave frozen orbits.\n\n11.9.2 Determining the Frozen Parameters\n\nConsider now the relation (11.46) giving the altitude h of the satellite\nabove an arbitrary point specified by the position on orbit ?. This altitude,\n\n6The first publications treating the subject of frozen orbits date back to 1965. They\nconcerned satellites in low orbit around the Moon. The term \u201cfrozen orbit\u201d was first used\nto describe Seasat in 1976.\n\n\n\n552 Chapter 11. Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\nfor this point of geocentric latitude ?, will be denoted by h?(t). With (11.46),\nwe see that it varies in time through the osculating, i.e., instantaneous, orbital\nelements:\n\nh?(t) = h\n[\na(t), e(t), i(t), ?(t)\n\n]\n. (11.50)\n\nWe only take into account long period or secular variations here. Short period\nvariations are averaged over one orbital revolution. Under such conditions,\nas discussed in Chap. 6 and shown schematically in Fig. 6.4, the semi-major\naxis a does not change. Equation (6.95) shows that, as long as the inclination\nis nonzero, the variation in i is negligible compared with the variation in e,\nwhich is illustrated in Example 6.1.\n\nEquation (11.50), which came from (11.46), thus simplifies to\n\nh?(t) = h\n[\ne(t), ?(t)\n\n]\n. (11.51)\n\nConsequently, the two parameters that concern us here, e and ?, undergo a\nlong period variation due to the odd zonal terms, mainly J3, while ? also\nundergoes a secular variation due to the even zonal terms, mainly J2. Writing\ndown the equations representing e and ?, whose values result from a complete\ntreatment of the Lagrange equations, we must solve\n\n{\ne? = 0 ,\n?? = 0 ,\n\nwhence e? = de/dt and ?? = d?/dt are functions of the unknowns e and ?, and\nto a lesser extent the other orbital elements.\n\nIt is a very complex exercise to establish the conditions for a frozen orbit\nin the general case. Here we shall find them for an expansion up to degree\n3. Using the perturbing potential R = R2 +R3 calculated in Chap. 6 in the\nLagrange equations, we obtain\n\ne?\n\nn\n=\n\n3\n\n2(1? e2)2 J3\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)3(\n1? 5\n\n4\nsin2 i\n\n)\nsin i cos? , (11.52)\n\n??\n\nn\n=\n\n3\n\n(1? e2)2 J2\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)2(\n1? 5\n\n4\nsin2 i\n\n)[\n1 +\n\n1\n\n2e(1? e2)\nJ3\nJ2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n\n)\nsin i sin?\n\n]\n.\n\n(11.53)\n\nIf we neglect J3 in (11.52) and (11.53), we find e? = 0 and the relation (6.74),\nrespectively.\n\nInclination Close to the Critical Inclination\n\nBy the very definition of the critical inclination given in (6.79), the term\n[1 ? (5/4) sin2 i] is zero. We thus have ?? = 0 and e? = 0. The orbit is frozen,\nwhether the eccentricity is low or high.\n\n\n\n11.9 Frozen Orbits 553\n\nFor inclinations close to the critical inclination, large oscillations in ? are\ndue to the J4 term (and following) since the contribution from J2 and J3 is\nvery small. The expressions (11.52) and (11.53) must be expanded to higher\ndegrees. It can then be shown that, for i between about 53? and 74? (or\nbetween 106? and 127?), the eccentricity for a frozen orbit varies between 0\nand 30\u00d7 10?3.\nInclination Far from the Critical Inclination\n\nFor inclinations differing significantly from the critical value, i.e., the\nranges i < 53?, 74? < i < 106?, i > 127?, as is usually the case for Sun-\nsynchronous satellites, (11.52) shows that\n\n? = \u00b190? =? e? = 0 . (11.54)\n\nSubstituting this value of ?, denoted by ?F, into (11.53), we obtain ?? = 0 by\nsetting the expression between square brackets equal to zero, i.e., setting\n\neF = e(?F) = ?\n1\n\n2\n\nJ3\nJ2\n\nR\n\na\nsin i sin?F . (11.55)\n\nValues for the frozen orbit carry the subscript F. Since this calculation refers\nto near-circular orbits, we have neglected e2 compared with 1 in (11.53). We\ncould also use (6.94).\n\nThe sign of sin?F depends on the sign of J3 in such a way that the ex-\npression for e comes out positive. For the Earth, with J3 negative, we take\n\n?F = +90\n? , (11.56)\n\neF = ?\nJ3\n2J2\n\nR\n\na\nsin i . (11.57)\n\nWhen the orbit is frozen, the perigee of Sun-synchronous LEO satellites is\nthus practically over the North Pole.\n\nFrozen Eccentricity\n\nFor the SPOT satellites, (11.57) implies that eF = 1.03\u00d7 10?3. The exact\nvalue of the frozen eccentricity is eF = 1.14\u00d7 10?3. For LEO satellites, eF is\nalways small, of the order of 10?3, and the orbit is thus near-circular.\n\nMany recurrent satellites, Sun-synchronous or otherwise, have a frozen\norbit. For some satellites, it is essential that the parameters e and ? be main-\ntained7 at the reference values8 eF and ?F.\n\n7For example, for the satellite TOPEX/Poseidon, between 1992 and 2002, we may note\nthe following exceedingly narrow ranges of variation for the orbital elements: eF from 0.73\u00d7\n10?3 to 0.83\u00d7 10?3, ?F from 264? to 270?, i from 66.037? to 66.046?, a from 7,714.422 to\n7,714.436 km.\n\n8The true values as obtained from the NORAD elements often differ somewhat from the\nnominal values. In Example 11.1, we note that the true values of the eccentricity of SPOT-5\nare well below the nominal values.\n\n\n\n554 Chapter 11. Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\nFig. 11.27 :Variation of the argument of the perigee ? of the satellite Terra at dif-\n\nferent dates. Transition from a revolving to frozen perigee (? = 90? \u00b1 20?).\n\nWe should also note that some satellites require a non-frozen orbit. To\nensure that the perigee does not remain permanently in the vicinity of the\nNorth Pole and that the gravitational field is sampled at different altitudes,\nthe geodetic satellite GOCE has variable eccentricity, ranging between 0 and\n4.5\u00d7 10?3. Hence, the altitude varies between 236 and 282km.\n\nExample 11.19 Variation in the position of the perigee for the satellite Terra\nand transition to a frozen orbit.\n\n? For the Sun-synchronous satellite Terra, launched on 18 December 1999,\nthe argument of the perigee ? had a secular variation between 0? and 360?,\noccurring at the approximately constant rate of ?? ? ?3.3? per day. How-\never, from 5 February 2001, by varying the eccentricity, the perigee no longer\nrevolves, but sits at the value ? = 90?, to within 20? (see Fig. 11.27). ?\n\n11.9.3 Altitude of a Satellite on a Frozen Orbit\n\nIn the case of a frozen orbit, where the ellipse representing the satellite\ntrajectory is fixed in the orbital plane, we may calculate the altitude of the\nsatellite as a function of a single variable, e.g., ?, over a period T . The altitude\nvariation will then repeat itself identically with period T . We give here an\nexample calculation of an altitude and altitude variation as a function of\nposition on orbit.\n\n\n\n11.9 Frozen Orbits 555\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360\n\n-25\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n\n10\n\n-5\n0\n5\n\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n\nAltitude\n(km)\n\n815\n820\n825\n830\n835\n840\n845\n\nPosition on orbit (\u00b0) Position on orbit (\u00b0)\nEquator\n\nASC.

L) and the geodetic latitude of the\n\nnadir ? (Geod. L) are given for each specified value of ?. Close-up of Fig. 11.28.\n\nGiven a and e, we can calculate b and c :\n\nc = ae = 8.386 km , b = a\n?\n1? e2 = 7,195.601 km , a? b = 0.005 km .\n\nWe have already noted that the orbit of a satellite of this kind is a circle\nshifted by 8 km relative to the center of the Earth (see Example 1.2). The\ndistance c is proportional to e, whereas the difference between the semi-axes\nis a function of e2 : a and b are thus equal to within 5m.\n\nIn Fig. 11.28, distances are expressed as a function of the position on or-\nbit ?. The graph of r(?)?r(0) shows a difference of 2ae = 16.772km between\nthe radius at apogee ra = r(?F + ?) and the radius at perigee rp = r(?F).\nConcerning the Earth ellipsoid, the maximum latitude attained, for ? = ?F,\nis ? = \u00b1?m, with ?m = 180? i = 81.298?, which gives at the perigee\n\nRT[?(?F)] = RT(?m) = Rm = 6,357.240 km , R?Rm = 20.897 km .\n\n\n\n11.9 Frozen Orbits 557\n\nFig. 11.30 :Altitude of the International Space Station (ISS) at different dates over\n\na little longer than 10 years, from 1998 to 2009. The space station, which is at a\n\nrelatively low altitude, must be rather frequently raised. Credit: NASA.\n\nWe now calculate the values of the altitude for particular points on the orbit\n(equator, ascending and descending nodes, perigee, and apogee):\n\nAscending node h(0) = a(1? e2)?R = 7195.596? 6378.137 = 817.459 .\nPerigee h(?/2) = a(1? e)?Rm = 7187.223? 6357.240 = 829.983 .\nDescending node h(?) = a(1? e2)?R = 7195.596? 6378.137 = 817.459 .\nApogee h(3?/2) = a(1 + e)?Rm = 7203.989? 6357.240\n\n= 846.749 .\n\nh(?) = h(0) , h(3?/2) = h(?/2) + 2ae .\n\nThe minimum altitude is 816.623km, reached when ? = 11.5? and ? = 168.5?,\nwhich corresponds to a latitude of 11.4? (? = 11.37?, ? = 11.43?). The\nmaximum altitude is reached at the apogee.\n\nSince the position of the perigee is symmetric with respect to the two\nnodes for this satellite, the altitude depends only on the latitude ? and we\ndo not have to specify the crossing direction (ascending or descending) of the\norbit. In Fig. 11.29, we have indicated the geocentric latitude on the horizontal\naxis, between its two extreme values ??m and +?m, and also the geodetic\nlatitude of the nadir (which takes into account the altitude of the satellite, as\nexplained in Chap. 2). ?\n\n\n\n558 Chapter 11. Orbit Relative to the Earth: Recurrence and Altitude\n\n11.10 Altitude and Atmospheric Drag\n\nAs we have seen in Chap. 6 when considering non-conservative perturba-\ntions, atmospheric drag causes the satellite to drop in altitude. In the examples\nin this chapter where we have discussed satellite altitude, the effects of drag\nwere not mentioned, either because they were negligible, or because they were\nfrequently compensated, which made them practically imperceptible.\n\nHere we give two examples where the drop in altitude due to drag is\nsignificant. In Example 11.21, we show how the orbit of the International Space\nStation (ISS) is frequently \u201cboosted\u201d, and in Example 11.22, how atmospheric\ndrag can play a fatal role for a spacecraft.\n\nExample 11.21 Altitude of the International Space Station (ISS) over the\npast 11 years.\n\n? The satellite ISS is in a relatively low LEO orbit and requires frequent\nenergy boosts to remain at a suitable altitude, as can be see from Fig. 11.30.\nIn this graph supplied by NASA, consider the continuous part of the curve\n\n 240\n\n 260\n\n 280\n\n 300\n\n 320\n\n 340\n\n 360\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\nA\nlti\n\ntu\nde\n\n (\nkm\n\n)\n\nTime (day)\n\nFig. 11.31 :Altitude of the satellite in Example 11.22 as a function of time.

Altitude in km, time in days.\n\n\n\n11.10 Altitude and Atmospheric Drag 559\n\nat the beginning of 1999. This linear part indicates that the altitude changed\nfrom h = 400.0km (day D = 1) to h = 389.9km (day D = 150), implying a\nsteady drop by 16.1 km over 149 days, or 108m per day. With T = 93min,\nand hence ? = 15.5, the drop in altitude per revolution ?1a is given by\n\n?1a =\n108\n\n15.5\n= 7.0m .\n\nFrom the general appearance of the graph, we see that this value is represen-\ntative of the general trend. We use (6.121) with a = 6,770km to obtain\n\nB? =\n1.11\n\na2\n= 2.42\u00d7 10?14 .\n\nUsing (6.118), we can find the ballistic coefficient B, taking Cd = 2.3, S =\n600m2, Ms = 250 tonnes (in 1999, while the mass of the space station went\nup to 417 tonnes in 2011):\n\nCd =\n2.3\u00d7 600\n2.50\u00d7 105 = 5.5\u00d7 10\n\n?3 ,\n\n? =\n2.42\u00d7 10?14\n5.5\u00d7 10?3 = 4.4\u00d7 10\n\n?12 .\n\nWe thus obtain an average value for the atmospheric density at this altitude\n(see Table 6.4). ?\n\nExample 11.22 Fall of a low-orbiting satellite (h = 350 km) during a period\nof maximal solar activity.\n\n? We consider a satellite in LEO orbit with h = 350 km, i = 60?, and with\nballistic coefficient B = 0.0160 (as for SPOT-4). We choose the scenario of\nmaximal solar activity in the atmospheric model MSIS-90 (see Table 6.4).\nUnder these conditions, the software Ixion calculates the change in the or-\nbit in a step by step manner. The drop in altitude h = a ? R is shown in\nFig. 11.31. Initially proportional to the time (between D = 0 and 25), the\ndecrease gets faster from D = 30, and when D = 45, the satellite reaches an\naltitude of 250km. At this point, the craft is doomed to almost immediate\ndisintegration. ?\n\n\n\nChapter 12\n\nView from the Satellite\n\nIn the preceding chapters, we have discussed the satellite orbit, position, and\nground track. All this can be deduced from the position S of the satellite as\nviewed from the center of attraction O, which is the center of the Earth. The\ntime has come to look at things from a different standpoint: we shall now\nbe concerned with the view from an instrument carried aboard the satellite\n(see Fig. 12.2). The main difference is that we are now looking at things from\nthe point of view of the satellite S. As a consequence, this chapter is principally\nconcerned with observation satellites.\n\n12.1 Swath of an Instrument\n\n12.1.1 Local Orbital Frame\n\nUp to now the satellite has been treated as a point, or at least, we have\nconsidered only the motion of its center of gravity. But as a vehicle, the\nsatellite can also move about its center of inertia. Although this kind of motion\nis largely irrelevant for the purposes of calculating its trajectory, it is of course\ncrucial when we come to ask what the instruments aboard will be able to view.\nIf we want to produce an image of the Earth, we must not aim at the sky,\nand conversely!\n\nManipulation of the angular orientation of the satellite is called attitude\ncontrol. The attitude of the satellite tends to vary under the action of couples,\nwhich may be external, due to radiation pressure or atmospheric drag on\nsolar panels, or internal, due to mechanical motion of the instrument motors.\nA stabilisation system is thus required to maintain the satellite in the right\nposition relative to the local orbital frame.\n\nM.

The axis\n\nSZc points toward the\n\ncenter of the Earth\n\nand the axis SYc is\n\nperpendicular to the\n\norbit. If the orbit is\n\ncircular, the axis SXc\nlies along the velocity\n\nvector.\n\nFor any point S on the orbit, this frame is defined by the following three\naxes, illustrated in Fig. 12.1:\n\n\u2022 yaw axis SZc, directed towards the center of the Earth, also called the\nnadir axis,\n\n\u2022 pitch axis SY c, directed normally to the orbital plane,\n\u2022 roll axis SXc, lying in the orbital plane and completing a right-handed\n\northogonal system of axes. This axis lies along the velocity vector of the\nsatellite when the eccentricity is zero.\n\nWe shall refer to the axes of the local orbital frame as the Cardan axes, with\nthe appropriate subscript.1 The angles obtained by rotation relative to these\naxes are the Cardan angles, defined in Sect. 5.4.\n\n12.1.2 Scanning Modes\n\nThere are various ways for an instrument to look at the Earth. The sensor\ncan be equipped with a fixed objective relative to the satellite, but in most\ncases, the sensor is mobile (either itself or through the action of a mirror)\nalong some axis of rotation.\n\n1The axes are sometimes taken in a different order, with a different orientation, e.g.,\nSZc pointing in the opposite direction to the nadir. However, in every case, the triad is\nright-handed and orthogonal and the direction of the nadir corresponds to one of the axes.\n\n\n\n12.1 Swath of an Instrument 563\n\nFig. 12.2 :Oblique view from the satellite Aqua. Late November 2011 offered mostly\n\ncloud-free skies and a compelling view of the entire length of Baja California and the\n\nPacific coast of Mexico. In the midst of the clarity, strong northeasterly winds stirred\n\nup dust storms on the mainland and the peninsula. The natural-color images required\n\nto make this oblique view were acquired on 27 November 2011, by MODIS (Moderate\n\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite. The Ocean Color\n\nTeam at NASA Goddard processes images like this to help assess the presence of\n\nsediment and plankton in the sea. Dust storms interfere with that processing, as the\n\nsandy aerosols block much of the incoming sunlight and the outgoing, reflected light.\n\nCredit (image and caption): Norman Kuring, Mike Carlowicz, NASA, Ocean Color\n\nTeam (NASA Goddard), University of Wisconsin.\n\nTo begin with, we may define three basic scanning modes, when the\ninstrument rotates relative to one of the three Cardan axes. In the first two\ncases, the instrument axis and the axis of rotation are the same, whereas in\nthe third the instrument axis makes a constant angle with the axis of rotation.\nThese three scanning modes are as follows:\n\n\u2022 With rotation about SXc, the instrument scans perpendicularly to its\ndisplacement. This is orthogonal or cross-track scanning.\n\n\u2022 With rotation about SY c, the instrument scans along the ground track.\nThis is along-track scanning.\n\n\u2022 With rotation about SZc, the instrument scans in conical mode, defined\nby the half-angle at the apex of the cone, which is the angle between the\ninstrument axis and the axis of rotation.\n\n\n\n564 Chapter 12. View from the Satellite\n\nDuring observation, the smallest detected element is called a pixel.2 The set\nof all such elements viewed on the ground in a single scan is called the swath.\n\nThe technical features of the various optical instruments and sensors are\nnot the concern of this book. We shall consider only the geometrical aspects\nof scanning.\n\nScanning Mode for LEO Satellites\n\nAn instrument aboard an LEO satellite can use one of the three elementary\nscanning modes listed above. It can also alternate between the first two, or\nscan obliquely by a rotation of the instrument about an axis in the plane\nSXcYc.\n\nIn orthogonal scanning, some instruments sweep from side to side across\nthe swath,3 pixel by pixel as it were. Other instruments simultaneously record\nall the pixels in one row, and some can even record over several rows at once.4\n\nScanning Mode for GEO Satellites\n\nConcerning the way images are acquired, for one cannot really say that\nthere is a swath in this case, geostationary satellites fall into two main cate-\ngories.\n\nFor satellites with three-axis stabilisation, such as GOES (from GOES-8)\nor GOMS, one axis is parallel to the polar axis, one axis points to the center\nof the Earth, and one axis lies along the satellite\u2019s velocity vector. The sensor\nscans the disk presented by the Earth.\n\nFor rotating satellites, such as the METEOSAT, GMS, or FY-2 se-\nries, the axis of rotation is parallel to the polar axis. In the case of ME-\nTEOSAT (first and second generation), the satellite rotates exactly 100 times\na minute. Amirror is used to sweep across the Earth\u2019s disk. For the satellites\nMETEOSAT-1 to -7 (first generation), this east\u2013west scanning is carried out\nfrom south to north at a rate of 2,500 rows in 25min. From METEOSAT-8\n(MSG-1, second generation), 3,712 rows are scanned in 15min. We note that,\nwith this method, although it gives excellent results, the Earth is only viewed\nover 17.4? per revolution, i.e., the sensor views the Earth for 4.8% of the time,\nspending the other 95.2% of the time looking into the darkness of space.\n\n2The word \u201cpixel\u201d was coined in 1969, by contracting picture and element.\n3To get some idea, on those satellites which carry it, the instrument known as ScaRaB\n\ninvestigates the radiation budget by scanning every 6 s. The effective part of the scan lasts\nfor 3.18 s. For the remaining 2.82 s, the instrument does a calibration sighting and repositions\nitself.\n\n4Charge-coupled devices (CCD) can acquire a row of pixels (1D-CCD, one dimension) or\nseveral rows (2D-CCD, two dimensions). Aboard SPOT-4, the HRVIR instrument uses the\nso-called push-broom mode with a 1D-CCD. The optical instrument is based on a telescope\nwhose field of view is covered instantaneously by a row of 1,728 detectors, each corresponding\nto one pixel. In the case of the POLDER instrument, carried aboard ADEOS-1 and -2 and\nParasol, the use of 2D-CCDs makes it possible to acquire a set of rows simultaneously,\nrather than just one.\n\n\n\n12.2 Swath Viewing Geometry 565\n\nWhatever method is used, the \u201cswath\u201d of a geostationary satellite will be\ntreated like the cross-track swath of a low-orbiting satellite: for a point P\nviewed on Earth, we consider the plane SS0P (see Fig. 12.3) and define the\nangles of sight as for an LEO cross-track swath. We thus define the angle\nS0SP which plays the role of the half-swath angle f discussed below.\n\n12.2 Swath Viewing Geometry\n\n12.2.1 Definition of Angles\n\nFor the following general relations concerning instrumental swath, we shall\ntreat the Earth as spherical. For more accurate calculations, we use the\nellipsoid.\n\nFigure 12.3 shows all angles relevant to the satellite view and swath. The\nsatellite S is in orbit around the Earth, at distance OS = d from the center\nO. The subsatellite point is denoted by S0. Thus OS0 = R is the Earth radius\nand SS0 = h the altitude of the satellite. We use the reduced distance\n\n? =\nd\n\nR\n= 1 +\n\nh\n\nR\n, (12.1)\n\ni.e., the distance SO expressed in Earth radii and denoted by ?, as already\ndefined in (2.38). For a circular orbit of radius a, we have d = a.\n\nA?P\n\nS\n\nO\n\naoa\n\nz f\nfo\n\nSo\n\nPo\n\nFig. 12.3 :Definition\n\nof angles relevant\n\nto the swath of an\n\ninstrument aboard a\n\nsatellite. The satellite\n\nis S and the sub-\n\nsatellite point is S0.\n\nThe instrument looks\n\nat points P , such as\n\nthe point P0 on the\n\nEarth\u2019s limb. The\n\nEarth is spherical with\n\ncenter O.\n\n\n\n566 Chapter 12. View from the Satellite\n\nAt a given instant of time, the angle between the line of sight from the\nsatellite and the nadir5 is\n\nf = (SS0,SP ) , (12.2)\n\nwhere P is the point the instrument is viewing. This angle is called the swath\nangle or scan angle.\n\nFor the point P , we define the viewing zenith angle6 by\n\n? = (OP ,PS) . (12.3)\n\nThis is the angle at which the satellite is seen from the surface, measured from\nthe local vertical. The angle of elevation, or site angle, is the complementary\nangle of ?, i.e., 90? ? ?.\n\nWe also use the angle ?, which is the angle at the center of the Earth\ndefined by\n\n? = (OS,OP ) . (12.4)\n\nThese three angles are related by\n\nf + ? = ? , (12.5)\n\nby considering the triangle OSP . The maximum value of f is obtained when\nthe target point P is on the Earth\u2019s limb. We denote this point by P0 and the\ncorresponding angles are given the subscript zero. Considering the triangle\nOSP0, we obtain the relations\n\nsin f0 =\nR\n\nd\n=\n\nR\n\nR+ h\n, ?0 =\n\n?\n\n2\n? f0 , ?0 =\n\n?\n\n2\n,\n\nor using the reduced distance ?,\n\nsin f0 = cos?0 =\n1\n\n?\n. (12.6)\n\nNote on Terminology. The angle f defined above was called the half-swath\nangle. When we speak of the swath of an instrument, we generally mean the\nangle moved through by the instrument at the apex, i.e., 2fM, where the angle\nfM is the maximal value reached by f when the instrument arrives at the limit\nof its orthogonal scan. The angle at the apex is called the field of view. If fM\nis greater than f0, we must obviously take fM = f0. To avoid confusion, we\nwill therefore speak of the maximum possible half-swath to describe f0 and\nthe maximum instrument half-swath to speak of fM.\n\n5The nadir is the direction given by the vertical, looking downwards, i.e., toward the\ncenter of the Earth. The opposite direction is the zenith. The word \u201cnadir\u201d comes from the\nArabic na?d. ir, from the root of the verb \u201cto look straight at.\u201d\n\n6In Arabic, semt er-ra?s means \u201cthe path of the head.\u201d This gives the word \u201czenith,\u201d\nthe point on the sky just above the head. The word \u201cazimuth\u201d comes from as-semt, \u201cthe\npath,\u201d with assimilation of the article.\n\n\n\n12.2 Swath Viewing Geometry 567\n\n12.2.2 Relations Between Angles\n\nLet us now establish relations giving one of the angles f , ?, ? as a function\nof one of the other two and the altitude via ?. We thus obtain six relations.\n\nRelations Between f and ?. In the triangle OSP , we have the relation\n\nsin f\n\nR\n=\n\nsin ?\n\nd\n,\n\nwhich yields\n\nf = f(?, ?) , sin f =\n1\n\n?\nsin ? = sin f0 sin ? , (12.7)\n\n? = ?(f, ?) , sin ? = ? sin f =\nsin f\n\nsin f0\n. (12.8)\n\nf and ? as Functions of ?. To obtain f as a function of ?, consider the\ntriangle OSP and express the segment PA? in two different ways (where A?\n\nis the projection of P on OS) to deduce that\n\n(d?R cos?) tan f = R sin? .\n\nTo obtain ? as a function of ?, consider the triangle OPA, where A is the\nintersection of OS with the line through P perpendicular to OP . This yields\n\nf = f(?, ?) , tan f =\nsin?\n\n? ? cos? =\ncos?0 sin?\n\n1? cos?0 cos?\n, (12.9)\n\n? = ?(?, ?) , tan ? =\nsin?\n\ncos?? 1/? =\nsin?\n\ncos?? cos?0\n. (12.10)\n\nExpressions for ?. We immediately obtain the values of ? with (12.5) and\nthe above relations:\n\n? = ?(f, ?) , ? = ?f + arcsin (? sin f) , (12.11)\n\n? = ?(?, ?) , ? = ? ? arcsin\n(\n1\n\n?\nsin ?\n\n)\n.

With 350/R = 5.487 \u00d7 10?2, we calculate ? and the angles by the above\nformulas. The results are given in Table 12.1. We can then compare the swaths\nof satellites like TRMM (h = 350 km) or Terra (h = 700km). For satellites\nwith altitude less than 1,000km, the roundness of the Earth does not account\nfor more than 10% of the value of the ground swath.\n\nThe limb is viewed with f = 45? when h = 2,642 km. Indeed, according to\n(12.6), we have\n\n?\n2 = ? = (R + h)/R, and hence h = R(\n\n?\n2? 1) = 2,642km.\n\nWe can check from Table 12.1 that, for h = 2,800km, the swath f = f0 is less\nthan 45?. ?\n\n12.2.4 Latitudes Viewed and Latitude Overlap\n\nViewed Latitude Range\n\nFor a satellite of inclination i, we defined the maximum attained latitude\n?m by (8.18).

This is a meridian plane. With cross-track scanning,\nit is when the satellite crosses this plane that it sees points on the Earth at\nthe extreme latitudes. For an instrument with maximum half-swath fM, the\nswath track lies in the interval\n\n[\n? ?v,+?v\n\n]\n,\n\nwhere the angle ?v is the maximum latitude viewed, as defined by\n\n?v =\n\n{\n?m + ?M , if ?m + ?M < 90\n\n? ,\n90? , if ?m + ?M ? 90? ,\n\n(12.15)\n\nwith ?M = ?M(fM, ?) calculated using (12.11).\n\nLatitude Overlap\n\nWhen ?m + ?M is greater than 90\n?, we say that there is latitude overlap.\n\nThis overlap concerns latitudes in the ranges:\n\n{[\n+ 90?, 180? ?

View from the Satellite\n\nFor a satellite with near-circular orbit, if a pole is viewed during a cross-track\nscan, the two poles are viewed during each revolution.\n\nThe geodetic latitude ?m is then obtained from ?m by the usual rela-\ntion (2.4).\n\nExample 12.2 Calculate the maximum viewed latitude and, in the relevant\nsituations, the range of latitudes covered by the ScaRaB (fM = 48.91\n\n?) carried\nby Meteor-3-07, Resurs-O1-4, and Megha-Tropiques.\n\n? For Meteor-3-07, i = 82.56?, ?m = i, ? = 1.187, we obtain\n\n?m + ? = 82.56 + 14.55 = 97.11\n? .\n\nAll latitudes are viewed. Moreover, for each hemisphere, there is overlap\nbetween the pole and geocentric latitude |?| = 180 ? 97.11 = 82.79?, or\n|?| = 82.84?.\n\nFor Resurs-O1-4, i = 99.69?, ?m = 180 ? i = 81.31?, ? = 1.129, and we\nobtain\n\n?m + ? = 81.31 + 9.40 = 90.71\n? .\n\nAll latitudes are viewed. The overlap is very slight, between the pole and\nlatitude |?| = 89.29?, or |?| = 89.30?, for each hemisphere.\n\nFor Megha-Tropiques, i = 20.00?, ?m = i, ? = 1.136, and we obtain\n\n?m + ? = 20.00 + 9.98 = 29.98\n? , or ? = 30.15? .\n\nThe latitudes viewed lie in the band [30.2?S, 30.2?N], which corresponds to\nthe region between the tropics (whence the name of the satellite). ?\n\n12.3 Pixel Distortion\n\n12.3.1 Calculating the Distortion Index\n\nWe consider an instrument which observes the Earth with cross-track\nscanning. The axis of rotation of the instrument is perpendicular to the plane\ndefined in Fig. 12.3. While the image is being acquired during the swath, the\npixel is distorted in the direction of the swath and normal to it, for purely\ngeometrical reasons. Here we discuss both kinds of distortion.\n\nIndex K and Relative Distortion of the Pixel\nin the Swath Direction\n\nEach angular interval ?f of the half-swath angle corresponds to a half-\nswath interval ?F on the ground. It is clear that, for a given constant interval,\nsay 1?, the value of ?F is smaller at the nadir (for f = 0) than when viewing\n\n\n\n12.3 Pixel Distortion 571\n\nthe limb (for f = f0): the satellite\u2013target distance increases and, furthermore,\nthe roundness of the Earth is relevant here.\n\nThe pixel, which depends on the value of the elementary interval ?f of the\ninstrument, has size ?F in the scanning direction. To find the pixel distortion,\nwe calculate the variation of the ratio ?F/?f as a function of the position of\nthe target point, which amounts to finding the variation of the ratio ??/?f\nas a function of ?.\n\nDifferentiating (12.9), we obtain\n\n(1 + tan2 f)df =\n? cos?? 1\n(? ? cos?)2 d? ,\n\nwhich yields, replacing tan f by its value as a function of ?,\n\nd?\n\ndf\n=\n\n?2 ? 2? cos?+ 1\n? cos?? 1 . (12.17)\n\nConsidering increments ?f and ?? small enough to identify them with df and\nd?, we obtain the desired function\n\nk(?, ?) =\n??\n?f\n\n.\n\nTo measure the pixel distortion K(?, ?), we set\n\nK(?, ?) =\nk(?, ?)\n\nk(0, ?)\n,\n\nthereby expressing k(?, ?) relative to its value at the nadir. This value is\nk(0, ?) = ? ? 1, which can be checked by calculating ?F at the nadir in two\ndifferent ways (using small angles), from the standpoint of S or O, whence\n?F = h?f = R??.\n\nThis pixel distortion index is thus\n\nK(?, ?) =\n1\n\n? ? 1\n?2 ? 2? cos?+ 1\n\n? cos?? 1 . (12.18)\n\nIt thus measures a one-dimensional distortion along the swath for fixed inc-\nrement ?f . (We are not concerned here with scanning in which ?f varies\nwith f .)\n\nIndex L and Relative Distortion of the Pixel Width\n\nThe pixel is determined by the intersection of the viewing cone, which is\nextremely fine, and the sphere of the Earth. The distortion in the width, that\nis, in the plane defined by Fig. 12.3, depends solely on the length SP . The\nindex L representing the corresponding relative distortion is therefore\n\nL =\nSP\n\nSPnadir\n=\n\nSP\n\nSH\n.\n\n\n\n572 Chapter 12. View from the Satellite\n\nUsing the reduced variable ?, we obtain\n\nL(?, ?) =\n1\n\n? ? 1\n?\n?2 ? 2? cos?+ 1 . (12.19)\n\nIndex S and Relative Distortion of the Pixel Area\n\nThis relative distortion does not depend on the shape of the pixel (dia-\nmond, ellipse, etc.). The index S is the product of the two indices K and L,\nconsidered in two orthogonal directions:\n\nS(?, ?) = K(?, ?)L(?, ?) =\n1\n\n(? ? 1)2\n(?2 ? 2? cos?+ 1)3/2\n\n? cos?? 1 . (12.20)\n\nThe maximum value of the angle ? is obtained when viewing the limb and is\ngiven by ?0 = arccos(1/?). When ? tends to ?0, the index K, and hence also\nS, tends to infinity. For the index L, the value is finite, viz.,\n\nL(?0, ?) =\n\n?\n? + 1\n\n? ? 1 .\n\n12.3.2 Pixel Distortion for LEO Satellites\n\nThe indices K, L, and S are calculated as functions of ?, but the results\nare generally expressed in terms of the variables ? or f . The distortion index\nK(f) is plotted in Fig. 12.5 (upper) for LEO satellites in near-circular orbit\nand for altitudes between 200 and 1,400km, in steps of 200km. This index\nbecomes large (K > 2) when f reaches roughly two thirds of its maximum\nvalue f0.\n\nExample 12.3 Calculate the pixel size and distortion index for the ScaRaB\ninstrument aboard Meteor-3-07 and Resurs-O1-4.\n\n? Two identical ScaRaB instruments are carried aboard the Russian satel-\nlites Meteor-3-07 and Resurs-O1-4. Scanning is across the ground track. The\nmaximum instrumental half-scan angle, beyond which the instrument cannot\nview, is fM = 48.91\n\n?, implying a field of view of 97.82?. The complete scan\ncomprises 51 pixels, corresponding to 50 increments, which gives a pixel size of\n\n?f =\n2fM\n50\n\n= 1.956? = 33.146milliradians .\n\nNote that this is in fact the effective pixel, while the true pixel is larger to\ngive overlap. At the nadir, this pixel size corresponds to\n?F = 40.8 km for ScaRaB aboard Meteor-3-07 ,\n?F = 27.8 km for ScaRaB aboard Resurs-O1-4 .\n\n\n\n12.3 Pixel Distortion 573\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nHalf-swath angle f (deg)\n\nIn\nde\n\nx \nK\n\n (\nR\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\npi\nxe\n\nl d\nis\n\nto\nrt\n\nio\nn)\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\nh = 200 km\n\nh = 1400 km\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nLongitude or latitude (deg)\n\nIn\nde\n\nx \nK\n\n (\nR\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\npi\nxe\n\nl d\nis\n\nto\nrt\n\nio\nn)\n\nGeostationary Sat.\n\nFig. 12.5 :Relative pixel distortion as represented by the index K, which measures\n\nlength distortion.

View from the Satellite\n\nAt the limiting value of the scan, the pixel length is\nK(fM) = 4.0 =? ?F = 161 km for ScaRaB aboard Meteor-3-07 ,\nK(fM) = 3.2 =? ?F = 86 km for ScaRaB aboard Resurs-O1-4 .\nThe ground swath is 2FM = 3,254km for Meteor-3-07, which exceeds the\nequatorial shift ??E = 3,059km. However, for Resurs-O1-4, the ground swath\n2FM = 2,078km is considerably less than the equatorial shift ??E = 2,819km.\nThe ScaRaB instrument was originally designed for satellites of type Meteor-3,\nat an altitude of 1,200km, the aim being to scan the whole planet in 1 day.\nTo obtain this result aboard satellites like Resurs-O1 at an altitude of 800km,\nthe instrument would have had to scan up to angles fM = 55\n\n?, and this would\nhave given a pixel distortion of K = 5.3 (see Fig. 12.8). ?\n\nExample 12.4 Pixel distortion for the ScaRaB instrument aboard Megha-\nTropiques.\n\n? The ScaRaB instrument described in Example 12.3 is also carried aboard\nthe French\u2013Indian satellite Megha-Tropiques. Once again, the swath is cross-\ntrack. At the nadir, with an angle of 33.146mrad, the effective size of the\npixel (and also the separation between two pixels) is 865.6km. The true pixel,\nwhich must overlap neighbouring pixels, is naturally larger. At the nadir, it\nis diamond shaped with side 41.60 km. The diagonals of this diamond have\nlength 58.82 km. One of these, called the width, lies along the velocity vector\nof the satellite, while the other, called the length, is perpendicular, lying along\nthe scan direction.\n\nThe pixel is gradually distorted with increasing angle f . At the limit of\nthe scan, with fM = 48.91\n\n?, the diagonals have lengths 99.43 and 192.29km.\nThe results are given in Fig. 12.6. Figure 12.14 provides a representation of\nthe pixels in situ. ?\n\n12.3.3 Pixel Distortion for GEO Satellites\n\nAlthough a geostationary satellite sees almost half the Earth\u2019s surface,\naround the edge of the observed disk, the pixel distortion is considerable. The\ngraph of K(?) in Fig. 12.5 (lower) shows that, for a geostationary satellite, the\ndistortion index exceeds 2 beyond 50?. The angle ? can be replaced by |???S|,\nthe longitude along the equator, measured from the subsatellite point, or by\n|?|, the latitude measured along the meridian ?S. These graphs are clearly\ngoing to be the same for all geostationary satellites.\n\n\n\n12.3 Pixel Distortion 575\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nHalf-swath angle f (deg)\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \npi\n\nxe\nl d\n\nis\nto\n\nrt\nio\n\nn \n- \n\nIn\nde\n\nx \nK\n\n, L\n, S\n\nMegha-Tropiques\n\nAltitude =  865.5 km\nInclination  =  20.00 \u00b0\nPeriod =   101.93 min\nEquatorial shift=  2892.0 km\n\nf = (field of view)/2\nMaximal half-swath f =    61.7 \u00b0\n\nIndex K (Relative pixel distortion)\nIndex L (Relative width pixel distortion)\nIndex S (Relative area pixel distortion)\n\nK L S=K*L\n\nMC LMD\n\nf ? ?

The ground\n\ntrack of a half-swath\n\nis shown by a dashed\n\ncurve.\n\n12.4 Swath Track for an LEO Satellite\n\nFor LEO observation satellites, the two main scanning modes are cross-\ntrack and conical. They concern two completely different kinds of instrument.\nIn the case of cross-track scanning instruments, one exploits (although on rare\noccasions) the possibility of orienting the device differently so that it can view\nalong the track or along some other direction. Here we shall examine these\ndifferent scanning modes.\n\n12.4.1 Cross-track Swath\n\nIn order to calculate the coordinates of the points viewed and thus plot\nthe ground track of the cross-track scan, we return to the Euler angles first\ndiscussed when determining the subsatellite point on the ground track.\n\nWe consider that the scan with instantaneous angle f from the satellite S\nis equivalent to a scan with instantaneous angle ? from the center O of the\nEarth. Scanning is in the plane perpendicular to the orbit, passing through S\nand O. Viewed from O, it is thus a scan with angle ? and axis OY (parallel\nto SX in the orbital plane), where the orthogonal axes OXY Z were defined\npreviously as in Fig. 8.2.\n\n\n\n12.4 Swath Track for an LEO Satellite 577\n\nThis rotation has matrix P4 given by\n\nP4 =\n\n?\n? cos? 0 ? sin?0 1 0\n\nsin? 0 cos?\n\n?\n? . (12.21)\n\nIf (X ?, Y ?, Z ?) are the Cartesian coordinates of the target point on the Earth\nrelative to the frame ?(Oxyz), we obtain these new coordinates from\n\n?\n?X\n\n?\n\nY ?\n\nZ ?\n\n?\n? = P4\n\n?\n?XY\n\nZ\n\n?\n? ,\n\nwhere the coordinates (X,Y, Z) of the subsatellite point were obtained using\nthe product of the three rotations defined by (8.8). Figure 12.7 completes\nFig. 8.2 with the fourth rotation. Using (8.12) to (8.14), the Cartesian\ncoordinates (X ?, Y ?, Z ?) can be used to calculate the polar coordinates ?? and\n?? of the target point.\n\nScanning and Ground Track of the Cross-track Swath\n\nWhen an instrument scans, the scan moves extremely quickly across the\nground. For example, the instrument ScaRaB aboard Meteor-3-07 completes\none scan in 3.18 s, so that the average speed of the scan on the ground is\n3254/3.18 = 1,024km s?1. Compared with the displacement of the subsatellite\npoint along the satellite ground track, which is 6 km s?1, each swath track can\nbe treated as instantaneous. For HRVIR aboard SPOT-4, the scan is effectively\ninstantaneous.\n\nThe ground track of the orthogonal swath, perpendicular to the orbital\nplane, thus makes an angle of 90? ? i with the equator. However, as we saw\npreviously, the ground track makes an angle i? with the equator. This is the\napparent inclination. In diagrams showing the ground tracks, the normal to\nthe ground track of the swath thus makes an angle i ? i? with the satellite\nground track at the equator, given by (8.30). In other words, the ground track\nof the cross-track swath is not exactly perpendicular to the satellite ground\ntrack.\n\nNote on Cartography. This angular difference only shows up true to scale\non maps plotted with a conformal projection. On the two maps of Fig. 12.8,\nplotted with the Mercator projection, one can evaluate the angle between\nthe scan and the ground track at the equator and check that this is not a\nright-angle.\n\nEquatorial Overlap\n\nConsider the full swath of an instrument to its viewing limit. Its width on\nthe ground is 2FM. Let LE be the portion of the equator covered by the swath\nduring one crossing by the satellite. To a first approximation,\n\n\n\n578 Chapter 12.

(12.22)\n\nIn fact, the ground track is related to the apparent inclination i? and the\nswath to the inclination i, and the exact relation for the orbit and swath\nground tracks at the equator is\n\nLE =\n2FM\n\nsin i+ cos i tan(i? i?) =\n2FM\nsin i\n\n1\n\n1 +\ntan ?i\ntan i\n\n. (12.23)\n\nUsing the value of ?i = i? ? i given by (8.30), we find\n\nLE =\n2FM\nsin i\n\n(\n1? cos i\n\n?\n\n)\n. (12.24)\n\nFractional Equatorial Overlap\n\nIt is interesting to compare this distance LE with the equatorial shift DE,\nas given by (8.27). Both lengths are measured along the equator and their\nratio QE thus indicates the fraction of the equator seen by the satellite in 1\nday, during the ascending node crossing:\n\nQE =\nLE\nDE\n\n=\nFM\n?R\n\n?? cos i\nsin i\n\n. (12.25)\n\nIntroducing the angle at the center ?M in radians, corresponding to FM, we\nthen obtain\n\nQE =\n?M\n?\n\n?? cos i\nsin i\n\n. (12.26)\n\nIf QE is greater than 1, certain points on the equator are viewed more than\nonce during the ascending node crossing (and likewise, of course, for the\ndescending node crossing).\n\nThe average number N(?, f) of daily crossings, which depends on the\nlatitude ? and the half-swath f , is\n\nN(0, fM) = 2QE . (12.27)\n\nWe may also calculate the half-swath fQ that will yield a predetermined frac-\ntion QE of equatorial overlap. We first calculate the corresponding angle ?Q\nat the center of the Earth, viz.,\n\n?Q = ?\nsin i\n\n?? cos iQE . (12.28)\n\nThe value of fQ is deduced from ?Q using (12.9).\n\nExample 12.5 Ground track of the swath for the same instrument, ScaRaB,\ncarried aboard three different satellites: Meteor-3-07, Resurs-O1-4, and Megha-\nTropiques.\n\n\n\n580 Chapter 12. View from the Satellite\n\n? ScaraB was originally designed to fly aboard Meteor-3-07. Two instruments\nwith identical geometrical characteristics were then flown aboard Resurs-O1-4\nand Megha-Tropiques.\n\nMeteor-3-07. This instrument was designed to provide full daily equatorial\noverlap. To see how to achieve this, we apply (12.28) with QE = 1. For this\nsatellite, i = 82.56?, ? = 1.1873, and ? = 13.0986. We thus calculate ?1 in\ndegrees:\n\n?1 = 180\nsin 82.56\n\n13.0986? cos 82.56 = 13.76\n? ,\n\ntan f1 =\nsin 13.76\n\n1.1873? cos 13.76 = 1.1013 .\n\nThe half-swath angle is therefore f1 = arctan(1.1013) = 47.76\n?. The scanning\n\naperture is always chosen very slightly bigger, in this case fM = 48.91\n?. The\n\ncorresponding value of FM = R?M is obtained by\n\n?M = ?fM + arcsin(? sin fM) = ?48.910 + 63.488 = 14.578? = 0.2544 rad ,\n\nFM = 1,622 km .\n\nFigure 12.8 (upper) shows the swath ground track. For clarity, swaths have\nbeen plotted every 60 s, whereas in fact ScaRaB scans every 6 s.\n\nResurs-O4-1. The satellite Resurs-O4-1 is Sun-synchronous and follows a\nlower orbit: ? = 1.1277, i = 98.69?, ? = ? = 14.2165. With half-swath\nfM = 48.91\n\n?, the ground swath is\n\n?M = 48.910? 58.203 = 9.293? = 0.1622 rad , FM = 1,034 km .\n\nThe fractional equatorial overlap QE is then\n\nQE =\n0.1622\n\n?\n\n14.2165? cos 98.69\nsin 98.69\n\n= 0.750 .\n\nWe thus find that QE is less than unity, as can be clearly seen in Fig. 12.8\n(lower). For a point on the equator, the daily average number of crossings\ngiven by (12.27) is N = 1.50.\n\nMegha-Tropiques. The satellite Megha-Tropiques is in a very slightly in-\nclined orbit: ? = 1.1357, i = 20.00?, ? = 97/7 = 13.8571. With fM = 48.91?,\nwe obtain\n\n?M = 9.956\n? , FM = 1,108 km .\n\nWe thus calculate QE = 2.08, which indicates that the daily average number\nof crossings at the equator is N = 4.16. See Fig. 12.15. ?\n\n\n\n12.4 Swath Track for an LEO Satellite 581\n\nSwath and Mission Constraints\n\nThe swath of the main instrument on a satellite and the orbital character-\nistics of that satellite are related. This is exemplified in Fig. 12.9, which shows\nthat the swath of the VIIRS instrument is such that the Earth is completely\nscanned every day. This constraint is particularly important if the satellite is\nrecurrent. We shall give here several examples for the very different cases of\nwide, narrow, and very narrow swaths.\n\nExample 12.6 Fulfilling mission requirements with regard to swath and\nrecurrence for Oceansat-1, SPOT-1, and ICESat.\n\n? These three satellites are in near-polar orbits.\n\nOceansat-1. The Indian satellite Oceansat-1 (IRS-P4) is Sun-synchronous\n(equatorial crossing at noon and midnight), and recurrent with triple [14, 1, 2],\ncorresponding to a cycle of 29 revolutions over 2 days. The equatorial shift is\nthen\n\n??E = ?\n360\n\n14.5\n= ?24.83? , DE = 2,763.8 km .\n\nThe aim of the mission is to view the equator by day every 2 days. To a first\napproximation (the cross-track swath is practically parallel to the equator),\nthe ground swath 2FM must be at least equal to half of the equatorial shift,\ni.e.,\n\n?M =\n180\n\n29\n= 6.21? , FM =\n\n1\n\n4\nDE = 691 km .\n\nEquation (12.9) implies that fM = 42.3\n?. The precise calculation using (12.28)\n\nwith QE = 0.5 and i = 98.29\n?, ? = 1.1129, and ? = 29/2 = 14.50 yields\n\n?M = 90\nsin 98.29\n\n14.50? cos 98.29 = 6.0816\n? ,\n\nand then fM = 41.79\n?. The instrument OCM aboard this satellite has a total\n\nswath of 1,420km, or FM = 710km, which is a few kilometers more than the\nstrict minimum swath required. The calculation gives\n\nFM = 710 km =? fM = 43.0? , QE = 0.52 .\n\nThe fractional equatorial overlap is thus slightly above 1/2.\n\nSPOT-1. When the SPOT project was under development, the planned\naltitude was somewhere between 800 and 850km, low enough to have good\nresolution, but high enough to avoid atmospheric drag. The instrument HRV\ncarried by SPOT-1 was designed with a field of view of 8.4?, or fM = 4.2?.\n\n\n\n582 Chapter 12. View from the Satellite\n\nThe aim was that the grid interval ? defined by (11.20) should be slightly less\nthan the ground swath.\n\nWe can calculate the interval ? ? 2h tan fM ? 1.06?, which implies that the\nnumber of round trips during the recurrence cycle is NTo = 360/1.06 ? 340.\nThen ? lies between 14.26 for h = 800 km and 14.11 pour h = 850km. For\nthe cycle CTo = NTo/?, the limiting value is thus CTo = 24. During the\ndevelopment stage of the mission, it was also decided that the cycle should be\nless than 1 month, and this implies that\n\n24 ? CTo ? 30 .\n\nThe recurrence triple will thus have the form [14, DTo , CTo ] with 340 ?\nNTo ? 427. Considerations regarding subcycles then determined the choice\nof triple [14, +5, 26], 369 revolutions.\n\nICESat. The satellite ICESat carries a laser for altimetry. This instrument,\nknown as GLAS, aims at the nadir with an almost \u201cpointlike\u201d field of view,\nsince the pixel measures only 66m on the ground. Recurrence with the very\nlong cycle of 2,723 round trips in 183 days, implying a grid interval of\n? = 15km, guarantees that, during the whole cycle, the satellite will never\nrecross its ground track. ?\n\n12.4.2 Variable-Yaw Swath\n\nCross-track scanning, or XT mode in the terminology used by NASA,\ncorresponds to a yaw angle of 0?. The yaw angle is measured in a plane\nperpendicular to the yaw axis, or nadir axis, joining the satellite to the center\nof the Earth. There are scanning modes along the track, called along-track\nswath or AT mode, corresponding to a yaw angle of 90?. In this case, the\nswath does not exactly cover the ground track, for the same reasons that\nthe cross-track swath is not exactly perpendicular to the ground track (see\nChap. 8 for the contrast between inclination and apparent inclination, i.e.,\nthe angles i and i?, or j and j?). By adjusting the yaw angle as a function of\nthe latitude overflown, the ground track can be covered by the swath [see in\nparticular (8.37)]. An application is described in Example 12.7.\n\nAnother scanning mode varies the yaw angle continuously, and this is\nillustrated in Example 12.8.\n\nExample 12.7 Difference between along-track (AT-mode) scanning and true\nalong-track (TAT-mode) scanning.\n\n? To study the Earth radiation budget, NASA developed the instrument\nCERES (Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System), which has been\n\n\n\n12.4 Swath Track for an LEO Satellite 583\n\nSuomi NPP\nOrbit - Ground track\nRecurrence = [14; +3; 16] 227\n\n2011 11 24 11:31:00 UTC  >>>     51.0 min =   0.04 day\n\nAcross track swath (XT mode)\n\nAltitude =  824.0 km\n\ne = 0.000009\n\na = 7202.102 km\n\nIncl. / SUN-S.= 98.69 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   101.50 min    * rev/day =14.19\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 2824.7 km  (  25.4 \u00b0)\n\n**   Half-swath:  56.1\u00b0  =>  1500 km [ 0.50 min]\n\nAsc.

The radiometer used was the CERES instrument carried by Terra.\nOnce every cycle of 16 days, the (ascending and descending) ground tracks of\nthe satellite cross on the same day very close to the VAS. Indeed, a grid point\ncan be seen on Fig. 12.10 (lower), very close to the VAS.\n\nIn AT mode, the ground swath makes an angle of a few degrees with\nthe satellite ground track. The two tracks do not overlap, as can be seen in\nFig. 12.10 (upper). We asked NASA to vary the yaw angle of CERES on 19\nAugust 2004, using the programmable azimuth plane (PAP) scanning mode.\nIn this mode, the yaw angle is determined by (8.37) as a function of the\nlatitude overflown. This gives the value of ?j. The result of this modification\nis clearly apparent in Fig. 12.10 (lower). The ground swath for AT/PAP-mode\nscanning, also called true along-track (TAT-mode) scanning, exactly covers\nthe ground track of the satellite orbit. ?\n\nExample 12.8 Ground swath of the CERES radiometer carried by the satellite\nTerra, in cross-track (XT) mode and variable-yaw (RAP) mode.\n\n? We represent the ground track of the CERES instrument aboard Terra,\nwhen the satellite passes over North America, considering two different\nscanning modes: cross-track (XT-mode) scanning, shown in Fig. 12.11, and\nvariable-yaw (RAP-mode) scanning, shown in Fig. 12.12. The scanning mode\nknown as rotating azimuth plane (RAP) mode consists in making a half-turn\nin 6min, then a half-turn back. The swath shown here, every 6 s, corresponds\nto f = 56.1?. ?\n\n12.4.3 Conical Swath\n\nConical swaths are used by microwave radiometers, in particular. In this\ncase, for physical reasons connected with the phenomenon, the target points\nmust be viewed at a constant angle. The maximum half-swath fM must there-\nfore be adapted to the altitude of the satellite and also to the angle ?M.\n\nA conical swath is specified by two angles (see Fig. 12.13), which are in\northogonal planes:\n\n\u2022 the half-swath angle fM (or viewing zenith angle ?M), in a vertical plane,\n\u2022 the half aperture ?M, in the horizontal plane tangent to the Earth\u2019s sphere.\n\n7There are in fact six versions of this instrument: PFM (Proto Flight Model) aboard\nTRMM, FM1 and FM2 aboard Terra, FM3 and FM4 aboard Aqua, and FM5 aboard NPP.\nThese instruments FM can operate in cross-track or variable-yaw mode as required.\n\n\n\n586 Chapter 12.

Orbital data\n\nIxion.\n\n\n\n12.4 Swath Track for an LEO Satellite 589\n\nThe conical swath is generally covered in the forward direction, with ?M of the\norder of 60?. With ?M = 90?, the conical swath sketches out a half-circle, and\nwith ?M = 180\n\n?, a circle. The positions of the points making up the ground\ntrack of the conical swath are calculated using a matrix product, with the\nsame kind of calculation as was discussed above for the cross-track swath.\n\nThe conical swath is characterised by the radius of the swath circle and\nby the effective or useful ground swath. The swath circle, centered on S0, at\nthe nadir of S, is generated by the point P which moves between A and B,\nas shown in Fig. 12.13. Its radius ?swath is thus\n\n?swath = R?M , (12.29)\n\nwhere ?M is obtained from fM or ?M using (12.11) or (12.12), respectively.\nThe effective ground swath is the width of the ground swath. If F ?M is the\n\nhalf-width of the ground track, then 2F ?M is represented by the distance AB,\nwith midpoint C. (Note that the point C is not on the ground track of the\nswath.) The distance F ?M is given by the length of the arc CB, i.e., F\n\n?\nM = R?\n\n?,\nwhere ?? is the corresponding angle at the center of the Earth (Fig. 12.14).\n\nWe obtain ?? from the spherical triangle S0BC :\n\nC? =\n?\n\n2\n, S?0 = ?M ,\n\n\n\n\nS0B= ?M ,\n\n\n\nBC= ?? .\n\nThe sine rule (ST VIII) then gives\n\nsin?? = sin?M sin ?M , (12.30)\n\nwhence the effective half-width of the conical swath is\n\nF ? = R arcsin(sin?M sin ?M) . (12.31)\n\nIn this result, if ?M > 90\n?, we take ?M = 90?, since the maximal effective\n\nswath is attained for ? = 90?.\n\nExample 12.9 Swaths of various instruments aboard the satellite Megha-\nTropiques.\n\n? The satellite Megha-Tropiques, flying at altitude h = 866 km, carries three\nscanning instruments (see Fig. 12.15 upper).\n\nThe radiometer ScaRaB scans across track. Its maximal half-swath is fM =\n48.91?, which corresponds to a maximal zenith angle of ?M = 58.78?. The\nground track, which has width 2FM = 2,216km, is shown in Fig. 12.15 (lower).\nFor clarity, not all swaths are shown.\n\nThe humidity sounder SAPHIR also scans across track: fM = 42.96\n?,\n\n?M = 50.71\n?, 2FM = 1,724km (see Fig. 12.16 upper).\n\nThe microwave imager MADRAS scans conically, in such a way that points\nare viewed at an angle ? = 53.50?. The viewing aperture ?M = 65? on either\nside of the ground track. This determines a swath of effective width 1,702km,\nshown in Fig. 12.16 (lower), every 12 s (the actual frequency is higher).\n\n\n\n590 Chapter 12.

View from the Satellite\n\nFigure 12.14 indicates the actual ground tracks of the ScaRaB (cross-track)\nswath and the MADRAS (conical) swath, showing the effective pixels. ?\n\nExample 12.10 Conical ground swath of the radiometer SSM/I aboard the\nsatellite DMSP-5D3 F-18.\n\n? The instrument SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave/Imager) is a passive rad-\niometer. Its axis makes a constant angle fM with the axis of rotation, the nadir\naxis SZ, in such a way that the viewing zenith angle is constant at ?M = 53.1\n\n?.\nFor this satellite at altitude h = 848 km, calculation gives\n\nfM = 44.9\n? , ?swath = R?M = 913 km .\n\nScanning is not through a complete circle of radius ?swath, but over an arc of\nangle 2?M = 102.4\n\n? on either side of the axis SX along the velocity vector.\nFor this satellite, scanning is in the forward direction. The effective swath is\ngiven by (12.31) as\n\nF ?M = 1,417 km .\n\nFigure 12.17 shows the ground track in steps of 1min for improved visibility,\nwhile the radiometer actually rotates at 31.6 rev/min. During one revolution\nof the instrument, i.e., 1.9 s, the subsatellite point moves through 12.5 km.\nLooking at the ground track over 1 day, we see that a large fraction of the\nEarth\u2019s surface is viewed every day. ?\n\n12.4.4 Ground Track Superposition\n\nThere are several reasons why one might wish to superpose the ground\ntracks of two satellites, for example, for a comparative study of the target\u2013\nsatellite geometry, or for calibration of similar instruments carried aboard two\ndifferent satellites. Apart from the geometrical superposition of the tracks on\nthe ground, there will also be a temporal constraint: the lapse of time between\nthe crossings of the two satellites at a given point should not exceed 5min, or\n15min, for example.\n\nExample 12.11 Superposition of the ground tracks of the Sun-synchronous\nsatellites MetOp-A and Aqua, during calibration of the instrument IASI.\n\n? Shortly after the launch of the European satellite MetOp-A, it was decided\nto compare the results obtained by its instrument IASI with those of a similar\ninstrument aboard the American satellite Aqua. Now it happens that these\ntwo Sun-synchronous satellites have very different ascending node crossing\n\n\n\n12.5 View from a GEO Satellite 593\n\ntimes, viz., ?AN = 21:30 for MetOp-A and ?AN = 13:30 for Aqua. The dihedral\nangle between the two orbital planes is found by observing that\n\n?AN(Aqua)? ?DN(MetOp-A) = 13:30? 09:30 = 04:00 ,\n\nwhich implies an angle of 4 \u00d7 15? = 60?. Figure 10.14 adapted to these two\nsatellites shows that the intersection of the ground tracks at a given time (at\nthe same LMT time at a given place, hence at the same UT time) can only\noccur at very high latitudes, in the vicinity of 80?N and 80?S.\n\nFigure 12.18 gives the result for a time span of 2 days, and tolerance\n\u00b115min. For each common ground swath, we note only the central point for\ngreater visibility. With this time tolerance, the superpositions cannot occur\nfor latitudes between 60?N and 60?S. ?\n\nExample 12.12 Superposition of the ground tracks of Megha-Tropiques and\nTerra during calibration of the ScaRaB instrument.\n\n? ScaRaB and CERES are radiometers yielding measurements of radiative\nflux. ScaRaB, aboard Megha-Tropiques, has a fixed cross-track (XT mode)\nscan, while CERES, aboard Terra, can vary its yaw angle and scan in RAP\nmode, in such a way that the ground swaths of these two instruments coincide\nand are parallel. For a 51 day validation exercise (this being the length of the\ncycle CS relative to the Sun for Megha-Tropiques), in April and May 2012, we\nprovided NASA with predictions for superpositions (times, places, and yaw\nangles). Figure 12.19 shows these intersections for the first day, 17 April 2012.\n?\n\n12.5 View from a GEO Satellite\n\nIn this section, we begin by discussing how the Earth is viewed from a\ngeostationary satellite, taking the Earth to be a sphere. We then examine\nin more detail the correspondence between the geographic coordinates of the\npoint observed and the associated pixel. In this discussion, the Earth will be\ntreated as an ellipsoid of revolution.\n\n12.5.1 Simplified Geometric Conditions\n\nTo understand the geometrical conditions under which a GEO satellite\nviews the Earth, it is generally sufficient to treat the planet as spherical,\nidentifying the latitudes ? and ?. When the satellite views the Earth, the\nmaximum swath in the sense that we have defined f0 is\n\nf0 = arcsin\n1\n\n?GS\n, (12.32)\n\n\n\n594 Chapter 12.

With ?GS = 6.611,\nthis gives the numerical value\n\nf0 = 8.700\n? = 0.1518 rad .

Then the longitudes viewed on the equator by\nS lie in the interval\n\n[?S ? 81.3?, ?S + 81.3?] .\n\nAlong the meridian ?S, the latitudes viewed occupy the same interval of 81.3\n?\n\non either side of the equator.\nFor an arbitrary point P on the Earth, with geographic coordinates ? and\n\n?, we write the distance D to the subsatellite point S0 (we mean, of course,\nthe distance on the sphere, measured along a great circle, viz., D = R?) using\nthe spherical triangle S0PP\n\n?, where P ? is the intersection of the meridian of\nP with the equator:\n\ncos\n\n\n\nS0P= cos\n\n\n\nS0P\n? cos\n\n\n\n\nPP ? ,\n\ncos? = cos(? ? ?S) cos? .

The distance D between a point on the Earth seen by the geostationary\nsatellite and the subsatellite point of the same satellite is defined by (12.36).\nThe locus of points on the Earth at the same distance D has been represented\nwith steps of 500km in the value of D, and 250km in the enlarged maps. We\ndenote these loci by L(D).\n\nMETEOSAT. In their operational phase, the European satellites\nMETEOSAT are stationed at longitude ?S = 0\n\n?. Figure 12.21 (upper) shows\nthe Earth as it is viewed by the satellite (the Earth\u2019s disk or slot). For given\nD, the curves L(D) are circles, represented by circles on this map, which has\na non-conformal but axisymmetric projection, called the perspective projec-\ntion. The Guyou projection, based on elliptic functions, presents the globe as\na rectangle, whilst preserving angles, i.e., it is a conformal projection. The\ncurves L(D) are represented in the direct aspect in Fig. 12.21 (lower).\n\nFeng Yun-2. The Chinese satellites FY-2A then FY-2B are stationed at\nlongitude ?S = 105\n\n?E. Figure 12.22 (upper) shows the locus of points L(D)\nviewed from the same angle in an orthographic representation centered on\nPeking (on the right).\n\nGOES. The US satellite GOES-East is stationed at longitude ?S = 75\n?W.\n\nThis position was previously occupied by the succession of satellites SMS-\n1, SMS-2, GOES-5, GOES-7, and GOES-8 (partial or total occupation dur-\ning their operating lifetimes). The Argentinian meteorological office (Servicio\nMeteorolo?gico Nacional) represents data in a stereographic projection cen-\ntered on the point (34.8?S, 68.6?W), which is located in the middle of the\ncountry. We have used this projection in Fig. 12.22 (lower) to represent the\nlocus of points viewed at the same angle. This locus L(D) is thus repre-\nsented by circles here, a property of the stereographic projection. We note\nthat GOES-East and Feng Yun-2 are diametrically opposite one another with\nrespect to the center of the Earth.\n\nElektro-1. The Russian satellite Elektro-1 (GOMS-1) is stationed at longi-\ntude ?S = 76\n\n?E. We have represented L(D) in a transverse Guyou projection\ncentered on Moscow in Fig. 12.23. It is clear why geostationary satellites are\nnot of much interest to Russia.\n\nAnik-F2. The Canadian telecommunications satellite Anik-F2 is stationed\nat longitude ?S = 111.1\n\n?W. We have represented L(D) in a transverse Guyou\nprojection centered onWinnipeg, MB (Canada), in Fig. 12.24. Once again, it is\n\n\n\n600 Chapter 12.

We consider\nthe following geocentric orthonormal frame: Oz is the polar axis, xOy is the\nequatorial plane, and Ox passes through S, the position of the GEO satellite.\nThe parking longitude of the satellite is ?S. A point P on the Earth\u2019s surface is\nspecified by its geographical coordinates, i.e., the longitude ? and the geodetic\nlatitude ?.\n\nThe Cartesian coordinates of the points S and P are thus\n\nOS =\n\n?\n? r = ?GSR0\n\n0\n\n?\n? , OP =\n\n?\n?x = N cos? cos(?? ?S)y = N cos? sin(?? ?S)\n\nz = N (1? e2) sin?\n\n?\n? , (12.39)\n\nwhere N is the great normal given by\n\nN = R?\n(1? e2 sin2 ?)\n\n,\n\nas discussed in Chap. 2 [see (2.15) and (2.12)]. Note in passing that the ecc-\nentricity e appearing here in these expressions relating to geodesy is the\neccentricity of the Earth ellipsoid. When we use N and ?, the equations\nare simpler with the eccentricity e than with the flattening f .\n\nWe consider the plane parallel to yOz which passes through P . This plane\nP contains the points P , P ?, and P ?? (see Fig. 12.25), where P ? is the projection\nof P onto the equatorial plane xOy and P ?? is the projection of P ? onto the\naxis Ox.\n\nThe image of the Earth as viewed from S is formed in a plane I called\nthe image plane, parallel to P and located at an arbitrary distance from S.\nIn I, we define a plane coordinate frame with center Oi at the intersection of\nOS with I. The axes are Oiyi, the intersection of the equatorial plane with\nI, and Oizi, the intersection of the meridian plane xOz through S with I.\nThen Oiyi is parallel to Oy and Oizi is parallel to Oz. A pixel Q is the image\nof the point P on the Earth: it sits at the intersection of SP with the image\nplane I. The point Q is specified in I by its coordinates C and L :\n\n\u2022 The coordinate C (column) is measured along Oiyi .\n\u2022 The coordinate L (row) is measured along Oizi .\n\nIn Fig. 12.25, Q?? is at Oi, C is obtained from Q??Q?, and L is obtained\nfrom Q?Q. The coordinates C and L have the units of angles.\n\n\n\n12.5 View from a GEO Satellite 605\n\nPixel Coordinates as a Function of Geographical Coordinates\n\nThe problem here is to establish the mapping (?, ?) ??? (C,L). In fact,\nit is straightforward to calculate the values of C and L in terms of ? and ?\nby referring everything to x, y, and z. Consider the triangle SP ??P ? in the\nequatorial plane. This is right-angled at P ?? and we have\n\ntanC =\nQ??Q?\n\nQ??S\n=\n\nP ??P ?\n\nP ??S\n.\n\nFurther, the triangle SP ?P is perpendicular to the equatorial plane and\nright-angled at P ?, and we have\n\ntanL =\nQ?Q\nQ?S\n\n=\nP ?P\nP ?S\n\n.\n\nWe thus obtain\n\ntanC =\ny\n\nr ? x , tanL =\nz?\n\n(r ? x)2 + y2\n. (12.40)\n\nVisibility Conditions\n\nLet ? be the angle between the normal to the Earth at P , the local ver-\ntical Pn, and the direction PS. The scalar product A specifies the visibility\nconditions:\n\nA = PS \u00b7 Pn = ?PS??Pn? cos ? . (12.41)\nIf A ? 0, the viewing zenith angle ? lies between 0? and 90? and the point P\nis seen by the satellite S. Otherwise, it is not visible.\n\nBy definition, Pn lies along the great normal N . We can thus deduce its\ncomponents, and also the components of PS:\n\nPn = N\n\n?\n? cos? cos(?? ?S)cos? sin(?? ?S)\n\nsin?\n\n?\n? ,\n\nPS = N\n\n?\n? ?GSR/N ? cos? cos(?? ?S)? cos? sin(?? ?S)\n\n?(1? e2) sin?\n\n?\n? .\n\nTaking the scalar product, the condition A ? 0 can be written\n\n?GS\n\n?\n1? e2 sin2 ? cos? cos(?? ?S) + e2 sin2 ? ? 1 .

The polar axis is Oz, the equatorial\n\nplane xOy, and the axis Ox passes through S. The points Q, Q?, and Q?? lie in\nthe image plane I, parallel to the plane P, which contains P , P ?, and P ?? and is\nperpendicular to the equatorial plane.\n\n\n\n12.5 View from a GEO Satellite 607\n\nGeographical Coordinates as a Function of Pixel Coordinates\n\nThe problem here is to establish the mapping (C,L) ??? (?, ?). We con-\nsider the image plane I at an arbitrary distance l0 from S. Let ul0 and vl0\nbe the coordinates of the point Q in the plane I, with axes Oiyi and Oizi\nspecified above:\n\nQ??Q? = ul0 , Q?Q = vl0 .\n\nIn a frame centered on S, obtained by translating the frame centered on O\nalong the axis Ox, the coordinates of Q are\n\nSQ = l0\n\n?\n??1u\n\nv\n\n?\n? ,\n\nwhere u and v are dimensionless quantities.\nConsidering the triangles discussed previously, we obtain C and L as a\n\nfunction of u and v :\n\ntanC =\nQ??Q\nQ??S\n\n=\nu\n\n1\n, tanL =\n\nQ?Q\nQ?S\n\n=\nv?\n\n1 + u2\n.\n\nGiven L and C, we can thus find u and v from\n\nu = tanC , v = tanL\n?\n1 + tan2 C . (12.43)\n\nWe can slide the plane I parallel to itself so that it coincides with the plane\nP , with the axes Oiyi and Oizi parallel to the axes Oy and Oz. To do this, we\nmultiply the vector SQ by a positive scalar k such that kSQ = SP . Setting\nK = kl0, this amounts to finding the distance K such that\n\nK\n\n?\n??1u\n\nv\n\n?\n? =\n\n?\n?x? ry\n\nz\n\n?\n? =?\n\n?\n?x = r ?Ky = uK\n\nz = vK\n\n?\n? .\n\nTo do this, we express the fact that the point Q coincides with P , hence lies\non the Earth ellipsoid:\n\nx2 + y2 +\nz2\n\n1? e2 = R\n2 .\n\nSubstituting the values of the Cartesian coordinates, we obtain a quadratic\nequation for K :\n\nwK2 ? 2rK + (r2 ?R2) = 0 , (12.44)\n\nwhere\n\nw = 1 + u2 +\nv2\n\n1? e2 .

(12.46)\n\nThe visibility condition stipulates a positive value for the discriminant of the\nquadratic in (12.44):\n\nw < 1 . (12.47)\n\nThe locus of points such that w = 1 corresponds to the boundary of the\nEarth\u2019s disk as seen from the satellite (zero discriminant).\n\nIf the point P is seen by S, (12.44) gives two solutions: the smallest, the\none we keep here, corresponds to the point P on the viewed face of the Earth,\nwhile the other solution corresponds to a point P that would be visible on the\nother face if the Earth were transparent.\n\nThe required value of K is therefore the distance\n\nK =\n1?\n\n?\n1? w \nw\n\nr . (12.48)\n\nWe thus obtain x = r?K, y = uK et z = vK, and referring to the definition\n(12.39) of the vector OP in terms of geodetic coordinates, this gives\n\ntan(?? ?S) =\ny\n\nx\n, tan? =\n\nz\n\n(1? e2)\n?\nx2 + y2\n\n.\n\nFinally then, the pixel coordinates L and C (row and column) can be used\nto calculate u and v, then w, and hence obtain K. With K, we can calculate\nx, y, z and obtain the geodetic coordinates ? and ?.\n\nExample 12.14 Conversion between pixel and geographic coordinates for the\nMETEOSAT satellites.\n\n?

From an arbitrary point\nP on the Earth, we now note the time and angular conditions of our view\nof the satellite S. This is the opposite problem to determining the ground\ntrack of the swath: we must now establish the satellite sampling for a given\ninstrument. We shall also determine, for this point P , the direction of the Sun\nat the instant of time when P is viewed by the satellite.\n\nBasic Principles of Sampling\n\nTo obtain the sampling, our method consists in noting all the intersections\nof the ground swath with a given meridian, called the reference meridian. This\nmethod, which underlies the sampling function of the Ixion software, can then\nbe used to make various comparisons and produce statistics depending on the\nlatitude of the target point.\n\nFor each point viewed, called the target and denoted by P , we determine, in\nterms of the satellite position S, the time at which it is seen and the direction\nPS, which is called the line of sight. This straight line is defined by the angles\nof the spherical coordinate system: the zenith angle, also called the viewing\nzenith angle (VZA), and the azimuth angle, or viewing azimuth angle:\n\n\u2022 For cross-track scanning, the zenith angle varies between 0? and a maxi-\nmum value ?M.\n\n\u2022 For conical scanning, the zenith angle has a fixed value, e.g., ? = 53?.\n\nWe call this the overpass of the satellite S at the point P . We can then refer\nto the overpass time, and the overpass zenith and azimuth angles.\n\nTemporal sampling is achieved when we know the overpass times in the\nsense mentioned above for any point, for a given satellite and instrument, over\n\nM.

Spatiotemporal and Angular Sampling\n\na certain period of time, e.g., 1 month. Insofar as this temporal sampling is\ncarried out for every point on Earth, we often speak of spatiotemporal sam-\npling. When we speak of angular sampling, we mean a record of the viewing\nangles for each overpass. When the word \u201csampling\u201d is used without further\nspecification, we are generally referring to both sets of data. Sampling data\nis supplemented by stating the conditions of solar illumination, i.e., angles\ndetermining the position of the Sun for each target point P .\n\n13.1 Satellite\u2013Target Direction\n\nWhen calculating viewing angles, the Earth is only treated as an ellipsoid\nin one case, namely when establishing the correspondence between pixel and\ngeographic coordinates, as we did in the last chapter, where we require an\naccuracy to within one pixel. But for the present kind of angle calculation,\nwhere we rarely require greater accuracy than one degree, we may consider\nthe Earth as spherical and identify the latitudes ? and ?. When calculating\nthe viewing zenith angle, for example, this amounts to defining this angle by\n? = (OP ,PS) as in Eq. (12.3) (see Fig. 12.3), whereas the strict definition is\n? = (Pn,PS) as in (12.41), where Pn is the normal to the ellipsoid at P ,\ni.e., the local vertical.\n\n13.1.1 Line-of-Sight Direction of the Satellite\n\nCalculating Angles\n\nFigure 13.1 shows the subsatellite point S0, which is the intersection of OS\nwith the Earth (center O). The swath plane F is the plane OS0SP , orthogonal\nto the direction of displacement of the satellite S. The velocity vector defines\na right-handed orientation in F .\n\nAt each time, we know the position S of the satellite. The position P of\nthe target is given by the characteristics of the swath. For example, in the case\nof a cross-track swath, f gives ? and we may then use (12.21) to obtain the\nrotation matrix P4. The geocentric coordinates of S or S0 are denoted by the\nlongitude ?S and the latitude ?S, and the geocentric coordinates of the pixel\nP by ? and ?. The two angles specifying the direction PS are the zenith and\nazimuth angles, which belong to the spherical coordinate system centered on\nP , with the local horizontal plane H. This plane, perpendicular to OP , is the\ntangent plane to the sphere at P .\n\nZenith Angle. The viewing zenith angle ? is defined by\n\n? = (OP ,PS) , (13.1)\n\nmeasured in the positive sense for the orientation defined by the satellite, with\nthe straight line OP (the local vertical) as origin, as discussed in relation to\n\n\n\n13.1 Satellite\u2013Target Direction 615\n\nN S\n\nO\n\nS o\n\nP\n\nFig. 13.1 :Directions relating to the swath of an instrument aboard a satellite (XT\n\nmode). The Earth is shown with center O, as is the North Pole N and the equator.\n\nThe satellite S, with subsatellite point S0, views the point P in a swath S0P (doubled\n\ncurve). This swath lies in the plane OS0SP , called the swath plane F, orthogonal to\nthe direction of displacement of the satellite S. Figure 12.3 shows the angles in the\n\nplane F.\n\nFig. 12.3. The angle ? is obtained by spherical trigonometry, using (6.169)\n[see (6.172) in Example 6.5], or simply from the scalar product OP \u00b7 OS :\n\ncos? = sin? sin?S + cos? cos?S cos(?? ?S) . (13.2)\n\nThe zenith angle ? can be calculated1 immediately from the angle ? us-\ning (12.10). One can also calculate ? directly using the scalar product\nOP \u00b7 PS, or more accurately, using the scalar product Pn \u00b7 PS, as explained\nabove.\n\nAzimuth Angle. The azimuth angle ? is defined in the local horizontal\nplane H. The local vertical confers an orientation on H. The angle ? is then\nmeasured in the positive sense for this orientation, taking the north as origin.\n\n1As the swath plane F is oriented, ? can take positive or negative values. Indeed, ?\nvaries in the interval [??/2,+?/2]. Insofar as the azimuth angle ? is well defined (see\nbelow) throughout the whole plane, it would suffice to define ? in the interval [0,+?/2].\nHowever, this redundancy allows one to say whether the satellite is in the ascending or\ndescending stretch of the orbit. One then assigns the sign of ? to f and ?.\n\n\n\n616 Chapter 13. Spatiotemporal and Angular Sampling\n\nIt is the dihedral angle between the swath plane F (OPSS0) and the meridian\nplane OPN of P , denoted by M :\n\n? = dihedral angle\n{\nM,F\n\n}\n, (13.3)\n\nthat is, the angle in H between the ground swath and the meridian at P . The\nangle ? is called the viewing or line-of-sight azimuth.\n\nTo calculate the angle ?, we consider the spherical triangle NPS0, shown\nin Fig. 13.1. The three known elements of the triangle are two sides (two arcs)\nand an angle, the dihedral angle between the two meridian planes through P\nand S0 :\n\n\n\n\nNS0=\n?\n\n2\n? ?S ,\n\n\n\n\nNP=\n?\n\n2\n? ? , N? = ?? ?S .\n\nWe seek the angle ?, which is the angle of the spherical triangle at P . Us-\ning (ST X), we obtain\n\ncot\n\n\n\nNS0 sin\n\n\n\nNP= cos\n\n\n\nNP cosN + sinN cotP ,\n\nor in the present case,\n\ntan?S cos? = sin? cos(?? ?S) +\nsin(?? ?S)\n\ntan?\n,\n\nand finally,\n\ntan? =\nsin(?? ?S) cos?S\n\ncos? sin?S ? sin? cos?S cos(?? ?S)\n. (13.4)\n\nBy definition, the image under arctan is an angle in the interval [??/2,+?/2].\nTo obtain the angle ? between PS0 and the north in the interval (??,+?],\nwe note that ? has the same sign as ?? ?S. We thus deduce that:\n\n\u2022 If tan? has the same sign as ?? ?S, we have ? = arctan(tan?).\n\u2022 Otherwise, ? = arctan(tan?) + ? [mod 2?].\n\nNote. The altitude of the satellite does not appear in the relation giving\nthe azimuth angle ?, whereas it obviously must in the determination of the\nviewing zenith angle ?.\n\nExample 13.1 Calculate the azimuth angle when the target point and the\nsatellite lie on the same geographic parallel.\n\n? When ?S = ?, Eq. (13.4) becomes\n\ncot? = sin? tan\n?? ?S\n\n2\n.\n\n\n\n13.1 Satellite\u2013Target Direction 617\n\nWe take the following points: P (45?N, 10?W) and S0 (45?N, 20?E). With the\nabove relation, we obtain tan? = ?5.278, whence arctan(?5.278) = ?79.3?.\nWith ?? ?S < 0, we have ? = ?79.3?.\n\nWe observe that the direction PS0 is not at right-angles to the north. This\ndirection is taken on the arc of the great circle passing through P and S0. As\nthe chosen parallel is situated in the northern hemisphere, this arc is north\nof the parallel, making an angle of 10.7? with the parallel at P . The angle is\nnegative (S0 is east of P ). If we swap P and S0, the angle ? is positive.\n\nIf we choose points in the southern hemisphere, such as P (45?S, 10?W)\nand S0 (45\n\n?S, 20?E), we obtain tan? = +5.278, whence arctan(+5.278) =\n+79.3? and ? = 79.3? ? 180? = ?100.7?. The north is still taken as the\norigin. ?\n\nPolar Viewing Conditions\n\nFor a circular orbit, if the pole is attained by the swath, it always sees\nthe satellite with the same zenith angle. A prograde satellite, oriented in the\ndirection of its displacement, always sees the North Pole to its left and the\nSouth Pole to its right. Conversely, a retrograde satellite (hence any Sun-\nsynchronous satellite) always sees the South Pole to its left and the North\nPole to its right. With the sign conventions mentioned above, ? is positive in\nthe case when a prograde satellite is viewed from the North Pole.\n\nWhen viewing from the pole, the angles ? and i are complementary\n(i.e., the sum of the angles is a right-angle), as can be seen from Fig. 12.4.\nEquations (12.9) and (12.10) thus become\n\ntan f(NP) =\ncos i\n\n? ? sin i , tan ?(NP) =\ncos i\n\nsin i? 1/? , (13.5)\n\nwhere the subscript (NP) indicates that the point under consideration is the\nNorth Pole. The signs of ?(NP) and f(NP) are given by the sign of cos i.\n\nFor the South Pole, with subscript (SP), we find the negatives of these\nvalues, viz.,\n\nf(SP) = ?f(NP) , ?(SP) = ??(NP) . (13.6)\n\nIf a satellite in circular orbit is to observe the pole during a revolution,\nand hence see both poles in each revolution, the half-swath f of its instrument\nmust be greater than the threshold value fP :\n\npole viewed ?? |f | ? |fP| with fP = arctan\n(\n\ncos i\n\n? ? sin i\n\n)\n. (13.7)\n\n\n\n618 Chapter 13. Spatiotemporal and Angular Sampling\n\n13.1.2 Geostationary Satellites\n\nAlthough the scanning mode is different, geostationary satellites can be\ntreated using the general relations with the substitutions ? = ?GS = 6.611,\n?S = 0, taking ?S to be the parking longitude. As we have already seen, for\nthe level of accuracy required in determining viewing angles, the Earth can\nbe treated as spherical, whence we may identify ? and ?.\n\nFor the zenith angle, we first calculate ? using (12.35). We then obtain ?\nfrom (12.10), which becomes here\n\ntan ? =\nsin?\n\ncos?? 1/?GS\n. (13.8)\n\nFor the angle ?, (13.4) yields\n\ntan? = ? tan(?? ?S)\nsin?\n\n. (13.9)\n\nThe two graphs in Fig. 13.2 give the viewing angles ? and |?| as a function\nof the latitude |?| and the longitude difference |? ? ?S|. Figure 13.2 (upper)\nrepresenting the values of ? should be compared with Fig. 12.21, which shows\nthe values of ? (locus of points equidistant from the subsatellite point for\nthe geostationary satellite) as a function of the latitude and the longitude\ndifference.\n\nExample 13.2 Calculate the viewing (or line-of-sight) directions of the satel-\nlite METEOSAT-9 from Paris and of FY-2C from Sydney.\n\n? METEOSAT-9 (?S = 0?). Viewing from Paris (48?52?N, 2?20?E), with\n?S = 0\n\n?, ? = +2.33?, ? = +48.87?, we obtain\n\n? = 48.91? , ? = 56.1? , arctan(tan?) = ?3.1? , ? = 176.9 .\n\nThe line of sight thus has zenith angle 56? (or elevation angle 34?) and azimuth\nangle 177? with the north (or 3? with the south, directed slightly westward).\n\nFY-2C (?S = 105\n?E).Viewing from Sydney (33?55?S, 151?10?E), with ?S =\n\n+105?, ? = +151.17?, ? = ?33.92?, we obtain\n\n? = 54.92? , ? = 62.6? , arctan(tan?) = 61.8? , ? = 61.8 .\n\nThe line of sight thus has zenith angle 63? (or elevation angle 27?) and azimuth\nangle 62? with the north. With |?| = 34? and |? ? ?S| = 46?, we recover the\ncalculated values of ? and ? in Fig. 13.2. ?\n\n\n\n13.1 Satellite\u2013Target Direction 619\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\nViewing zenith angle (deg)\n\nLongitude difference (deg)\n\nLa\ntit\n\nud\ne \n\n(d\neg\n\n)\n\n3030\n\n6060\n\n9090\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\nViewing azimuth angle (deg)\n\nLongitude difference (deg)\n\nLa\ntit\n\nud\ne \n\n(d\neg\n\n)\n\n0 3030\n\n6060\n\n9090\n\nFig. 13.2 :Viewing angles for the target\u2013satellite direction when the satellite is geo-\n\nstationary, as a function of the latitude |?| and the longitude difference |???S|.

Spatiotemporal and Angular Sampling\n\n13.1.3 Local View and Sky Plots\n\nLocal view diagrams, also known as sky plots, show the position of the\nsatellite and its motion over time as seen in the sky at the given location. By\n\u201csky\u201d, we understand here the celestial half-sphere centered on the observer\nat this location. In the terrestrial frame ?T centered on the center of the\nEarth O, the position of the satellite S is specified by the vector OS. Its\nCartesian components are given as a function of time by (8.10), but in which\n? is replaced, as explained in Chap. 8, by the Euler angle ?1 defined by (8.17).\n\nIn this same frame, the point P considered as the observation point is\ndefined by the vector OP . The geographic coordinates of P , the geodetic\nlatitude ?, the longitude ?, and the altitude above the reference ellipsoid, can\nbe used to obtain the Cartesian coordinates using (2.29).\n\nThe local view thus consists in representing the vector PS. To obtain a\nrepresentation on a half-sphere, we express the direction of PS in terms of the\ntwo viewing angles, i.e., the viewing zenith angle ? and the viewing azimuth\nangle ?, as calculated above.\n\nSky plots indicate the trajectories on a grid of polar coordinates. This grid\nrepresents the projection of the celestial half-sphere onto the local horizon-\ntal plane. There are several ways of doing this projection (orthogonal, linear,\nstereographic, perspective, and so on). For the stereographic projection pre-\nsented here, the grid looks like a set of concentric circles and radii.\n\nEach point on the diagram corresponds to a specific direction. The azimuth\ntaken from the north is represented as-is. The zenith angle determines the\nposition in this direction: at the center for ? = 0?, on the edge of the diagram\nfor ? = 90?, and in-between for intermediate values of ?, in accordance with\nthe rules of the stereographic projection.\n\nThe zenith angle ? is sometimes replaced by its complement hv = 90\n? ?\n\n?, called the elevation angle or viewing elevation. When there is no risk of\nconfusion with other symbols used elsewhere, it can be denoted by h and just\ncalled the elevation. The outer circle of the diagram corresponds to the circle\nof visibility: h = 0? (or ? = 90?) if the horizon is perfectly clear, h = 5? or\n10?, or 20?, etc., if specific reception conditions must be ensured. Obstacles\nsuch as buildings, trees, etc., which block direct viewing of the satellite at the\ngiven location, can also be outlined on the diagram with a suitable projection.\n\nExample 13.3 Sky plot for the Bangalore ground station of the Oceansat-2\nsatellite in India.\n\n? The Indian oceanographic satellites Oceansat-1 and -2 are Sun-synchronous\nand recurrent with a very short cycle CTo = 2 days. If the sky plot is estab-\nlished over 2 days, it will remain valid both for the ground track and the time\nuntil the end of the satellite\u2019s active life.

The beginning, middle, and end of each overpass is noted in\nTable 13.1. After a cycle of 29 revolutions over 2 days, the satellite exactly\nrepeats its original ground track, and at the same time: the conditions of\nthe overpass during revolution 32 (day 3) are strictly identical to those of\nrevolution 3 (day 1). ?\n\nExample 13.4 Sky plots for HEO communications satellites.\n\n?

With an orbitographic software, the duration of\nvisibility is obtained directly from sky plots, as we have just seen. Below we\nshall show how this kind of tool can be used to calculate the visibility window\nfrom geometric considerations, provided that one makes certain simplifying\napproximations.\n\nFor LEO satellites in circular orbits, the duration of visibility is of the order\nof quarter of an hour and one can therefore identify the frames ? and ?T.\n\nSatellite Passes Vertically over Observation Point\n\nWe consider the situation where the satellite S passes vertically over P , the\nobservation point on the Earth\u2019s surface. The orbit of S, whose plane contains\nP , is shown schematically in Fig. 13.5 (upper). The satellite S is visible from P\nas long as it remains above the local horizon of P , represented by the straight\nline S1PS2, hence on the circular arc S1AS2. The angle ? = (OP ,OS1) can\nbe found immediately from\n\ncos? =\nR\n\nR+ h\n=\n\nR\n\na\n=\n\n1\n\n?\n, (13.10)\n\n\n\n13.1 Satellite\u2013Target Direction 625\n\nwhere ? is the reduced distance. The period of the satellite is taken to be the\nKeplerian period T0. The duration of visibility ? is therefore\n\n? =\n?\n\n?\nT0 . (13.11)\n\nIn order to take observing conditions into account, let us fix a maximal viewing\nzenith angle. The angle ? at the center of the Earth is given as a function of\n? and the reduced distance ? [see (12.12)], which we denote here by ?(?):\n\n?(?) = ? ? arcsin\n(\n1\n\n?\nsin ?\n\n)\n. (13.12)\n\nIt can be checked that ?(?/2) = arccos(1/?).\nDenoting the limiting angle by ?l, visibility therefore lasts for a time\n\n? =\n?(?l)\n\n?\nT0 . (13.13)\n\nSatellite Does Not Pass Vertically over Observation Point\n\nWhen S crosses the sky at P , the viewing zenith angle goes through a\nminimum ?v, which was zero in the situation just discussed. On the horizontal\nplane tangent at P to the terrestrial sphere of radius R, the distance between\nP and the closest point of the ground track is\n\ndv = R tan?(?v) .\n\nTaking into account ?l, the radius of the circle of visibility is given by\n\ndl = R tan?(?l) .\n\nVisibility thus lasts for a time proportional to the lengths of the ground tracks\nwithin the circle of visibility, since the satellite speed is uniform, treating the\nground tracks as straight over this interval.\n\nLet ?(?l, ?v) be the duration ? expressed as a function of the two variables\n?l and ?v via ?l = ?(?l) and ?v = ?(?v). With the angles (?l, ?v) taken in this\norder, we obtain\n\n?(?l, ?v)\n\n?(?l, 0)\n=\n\n?\nd2l ? d2v\ndl\n\n=\n\n?\n1? tan\n\n2 ?(?v)\n\ntan2 ?(?l)\n.\n\nClearly, the condition ?v < ?l must be respected. The visibility window for\ncircular LEO satellites is thus given quite generally by\n\n?(?l, ?v) =\n\n?\n1? tan\n\n2 ?(?v)\n\ntan2 ?(?l)\n\n?(?l)\n\n?\nT0 . (13.14)\n\nExample 13.5 Calculate the duration of visibility for three LEO satellite fam-\nilies: the Transit constellation and the SPOT and Oceansat satellites.\n\n\n\n626 Chapter 13. Spatiotemporal and Angular Sampling\n\n? In each example, we consider a different limiting visibility angle.\n\nTransit. All the satellites in the Transit constellation (the first global satellite\npositioning system) follow a strictly polar circular orbit at an altitude of\naround h = 1,100 km, whence ? = 1.1725, T0 = 107.4min. By fixing a viewing\nelevation above 10?, or ?l = 80?, (13.12) then (13.13) imply\n\n?(?l) = ?(80) = 80? arcsin\n0.9848\n\n1.1725\n= 80? 57.13 = 22.87? ,\n\n? = ?(80, 0) =\n22.87\n\n180\n107.4 = 13.6min .\n\nSPOT. For SPOT-5 and all the SPOT satellites, we have h = 822km, ? =\n1.1289, T0 = 101.4min. It follows that, for viewing all the way to the horizon,\n?l = 90\n\n?:\n\n? = arccos(1/1.1289) = 27.6? , ? = ?(90, 0) =\n27.6\n\n180\n101.4 = 15.6min .\n\nOceansat. For Oceansat-1 and -2, we have h = 720 km, ? = 1.1129, and\nT0 = 99.3min. It follows that, for viewing all the way to the horizon,\n\n? = arccos(1/1.1129) = 26.03? , ?(90, 0) =\n26.03\n\n180\n99.3 = 14.36min .\n\nWith the Oceansat satellites, the conditions are as in the diagram of Fig. 13.3\nand Table 13.1. The limit of the viewing zenith angle is ?l = 85\n\n? (h > 5? on\nthe diagram). Hence,\n\n?(?l) = 85.00? 63.53 = 21.47? , ?(85, 0) =\n21.47\n\n180\n99.3 = 11.84min .\n\nConsider the ground tracks numbered 3 and 6 on the diagram:\n\n\u2022 Track 3: h = 86? or ?v = 4?. The satellite is almost vertically above the\nobservation point and\n\n?(?l) = 0.406\n? .\n\nApplying (13.14) with this value:\n\n?(85, 4) =\n?\n1? 0.0182?(85, 0) = 0.9998?(85, 0)\n\n? ?(85, 0) = 11.84min ,\n\nwhich corresponds to 11:50, to be compared with the exact value of 11:43.\n\n\n\n13.1 Satellite\u2013Target Direction 627\n\n\u2022 Track 6: h = 20? or ?v = 70?. The satellite is rather low on the horizon,\nwith\n\n?(?l) = 12.396\n? ,\n\n?(85, 70) =\n?\n1? 0.55892?(85, 0) = 0.8293?(85, 0)\n\n= 0.8293\u00d7 11.84 = 9.83min ,\n\nwhich corresponds to 9:49, to be compared with the exact value of 9:43.\n\nWe may conclude that the approximate formula (13.14) gives perfectly ade-\nquate results. ?\n\n13.1.5 Visibility Window for HEO Satellites\n\nIn order to study a highly eccentric elliptical orbit, of HEO type and with\neccentricity e, we consider the most favourable situation, where the point P\nis the subsatellite point when the satellite overflies the apogee A, as shown\nschematically in Fig. 13.5 (lower). The satellite S is visible from P as long as\nit is on the elliptical arc S1AS2. Given the approximations we have made, the\nlocal horizon S1PS2 can be replaced by the parallel B1OB2 passing through\nthe center of the Earth O. We then evaluate the duration of visibility as the\ntime taken by the satellite S to cover the elliptical arc B1AB2.\n\nAt a given time, the position of S is specified relative to the perigee A? by\nthe true anomaly v = (OA?, OS). The mean anomaly M of the point B1 is\ncalculated from (4.59) with v = ?/2, whence\n\nM(B1) = 2 arctan\n\n?\n1? e\n1 + e\n\n? e\n?\n1? e2 . (13.15)\n\nWe thus obtain the visibility duration as a function of the period, viz.,\n\n? =\n\n[\n1? M(B1)\n\n?\n\n]\nT0 . (13.16)\n\nExample 13.6 Calculate the visibility window for the Molniya, Tundra, and\nSupertundra orbits.\n\n? We examine here the three main types of HEO orbit.\n\nMolniya. For a Molniya type HEO satellite, we have e = 0.736 and T0 =\n718min. From (13.15) and (13.16), we obtain\n\nM(B1) = 0.7437? 0.4983 = 0.2454 rad = 14.1? , 1?\n14.1\n\n180\n= 0.92 .\n\n\n\n628 Chapter 13.

If we impose a minimum\nviewing zenith angle ? ? 70? and if P is not exactly the subsatellite point of\nA, we find that visibility lasts for about 8 h. This property is illustrated here\nin Fig. 13.6 (upper) and in Chap. 9 by Fig. 9.28.\n\nSupertundra. For a Supertundra type HEO satellite, we have e = 0.423 and\nT0 = 1,436min, whence\n\nM(B1) = 1.1340? 0.3832 = 0.7508 rad = 43.0? , 1?\n43.0\n\n180\n= 0.76 .\n\nThis represents a visibility window of 18 h over a period of 24 h.

For a Tundra type HEO satellite HEO like Sirius-1 to -3, we have\ne = 0.268 and, as for Supertundra, T0 = 1,436min, whence\n\nM(B1) = 1.2995? 0.2582 = 1.0413 rad = 59.7? , 1?\n59.7\n\n180\n= 0.67 .\n\nThis represents a visibility window of 16 h over a period of 24 h. ?\n\n13.2 Target\u2013Sun Direction\n\n13.2.1 Solar Line of Sight\n\nFor an arbitrary point P on the Earth\u2019s surface, with coordinates ? and ?,\nwe have already defined the local horizontal planeH. In this section, quantities\ncarrying the subscript s refer to the direction of the Sun. We now calculate\nthe spherical coordinates ?s and ?s of the direction PSs, Ss representing the\nposition of the Sun.\n\nTo do this, we consider the celestial sphere with center O, relative to the\npoint considered, as shown in Fig. 13.7. The direction of the zenith is OZ,\nnormal to the horizontal plane H represented by the horizon circle at that\nlocation. The direction of the celestial north pole is ON , normal to the equa-\ntorial plane E represented by the celestial equator. The half-great circle passing\nthrough N and Z is the geographic meridian M at the place in question. This\nis the plane of Fig. 13.7. The angle between the two straight lines OZ and\nON , or the dihedral angle (H, E), is equal to the colatitude of the place, i.e.,\nthe complementary angle of the latitude ? :\n\n(OZ,ON ) =\n?\n\n2\n? ? . (13.17)\n\n\n\n630 Chapter 13. Spatiotemporal and Angular Sampling\n\nN\nZ\n\nM\n\nO\n\nFig. 13.7 :Celestial sphere relative to a given point on Earth. The axis OZ is the local\n\nvertical, normal to the local horizontal plane H. The axis ON is the celestial polar\naxis, normal to the celestial equatorial plane E . The straight line OM represents an\narbitrary direction from the point in question.\n\nConsider now an arbitrary direction OM . The half-great circle through Z\nand M is the vertical of M . The half-great circle through N and M is the\ncelestial meridian ofM . When describing the direction of the Sun, we consider\nM at the intersection of OSs with the celestial sphere. This direction OM can\nbe specified relative to E using celestial equatorial coordinates, i.e., the right\nascension ? (or the hour angle H) and the declination ?. Relative to H, in\nlocal horizontal coordinates, it is specified by the azimuth ?s and the zenith\nangle ?s.\n\nWe shall express the horizontal coordinates as a function of the time (via\nH), the date (via ?), and the geographical position of the point P (via ?). In\nthe spherical triangle NZM , the sides are given by\n\n\n\n\nNZ=\n?\n\n2\n? ? ,\n\n\n\n\nZM= ?s ,\n\n\n\nNM=\n?\n\n2\n? ? ,\n\nand the angles are\n\nN? = H , Z? = ? ? ?s , M? ,\n\nnoting that the angle M , the angle at the body, is not used here. Concerning\nthe azimuth angles, the origin is taken when the point M lies in the merid-\nian plane M. The azimuth ?s, like ?, is measured relative to the northerly\ndirection.\n\n\n\n13.2 Target\u2013Sun Direction 631\n\nThe horizontal coordinates are expressed in terms of the equatorial coor-\ndinates and the latitude in the form (?s, ?s) = f(H, ?, ?) by the relations\n\ncos ?s = sin? sin ? + cos? cos ? cosH , (13.18)\n\nsin ?s sin?s = cos ? sinH , (13.19)\n\nsin ?s cos?s = ? cos? sin ? + sin? cos ? cosH . (13.20)\n\nThe reader is referred to Sect. 6.13 on spherical trigonometry, where the tri-\nangle ABC corresponds here to the triangle NZM . The above three relations\nare the fundamental relations of spherical trigonometry, sometimes known as\nGauss\u2019 relations.\n\nEquation (13.18) gives ?s, an angle in the interval [0, ?/2]. Substituting its\nvalue into (13.19) or (13.20) yields the azimuth ?s in [0, ?]. The value of ?s,\nwhich lies in (??, ?] is then given by comparing with the sign of H : ?s and H\nhave the same sign (negative in the morning, positive in the afternoon, with\nH = 0 at noon).\n\nEquation (13.19) or (13.20) yield ?s in the full interval [??/2,+?/2]. We\ncan thus determine whether it is daytime (the Sun above the local horizon,\nwith ?s ? 0) or nighttime (the Sun is below the local horizon, with ?s ? 0). In\nsome cases, it is preferable to use the solar elevation hs rather than ?s. These\ntwo angles are complementary.\n\nExample 13.7 Calculate the position of the Sun on 10 July 1998, at 06:30\nUT, at the Baikonur space base in Kazakhstan.\n\n? In Example 7.4, we calculated that the instant of time 06:30 UT corre-\nsponded on this date with 10:58 LAT. Naturally, one must use the local ap-\nparent time in this situation. We thus have for the hour angle\n\nH = 10h 58m ? 12 h 00min = ? 1 h 02m ,\n\nwhence H = ?62/4 = ?15.5?. Regarding the other quantities,\n\n?(D = 10 July) = 22.3? , ? = 45?38?N ,\n\nwhence ? = 45.5?. Equation (13.18) gives cos ?s = 0.8947, whereupon ?s =\n26.5?, implying a solar elevation hs = 63.5?. Regarding the azimuth, (13.20)\nimplies that cos?s = 0.8329, and since H is negative, ?s = ?33.6?. The\nstraight line PSs thus points eastward (this is before apparent noon, i.e.,\n12:00 LAT). ?\n\n\n\n632 Chapter 13. Spatiotemporal and Angular Sampling\n\n13.2.2 Sunrise, Sunset, and Apparent Noon\n\nSunrise and Sunset\n\nThe obliquity ? is used to define circles on the Earth\u2019s surface (small\ncircles called parallels) at certain significant latitudes: the polar circles, which\nare the Arctic Circle at ? = 90? ? ? = 66?34?N and the Antarctic Circle at\n? = 66?34?S, and the tropics, which are the Tropic of Cancer at ? = ? =\n23?26?N, and the Tropic of Capricorn at ? = 23?26?S.\n\nBetween the tropics, the Sun passes through the zenith at noon on those\n2 days of the year when the declination is equal to the latitude. With ? = ?\nand H = 0, (13.18) then gives cos ?s = 1, whence ?s = 0 or hs = 90\n\n?. Beyond\nthe polar circles, there are days when the Sun never rises, and others when it\nnever sets.\n\nTo study the sunrise and sunset in the general case, we write (13.18) in\nthe form\n\ncos ?s = sinhs = cos ? cos?(cosH ? T ) , (13.21)\n\nwith\n\nT = ? tan ? tan? .\n\nThe case of the poles can be treated immediately. Equation (13.18) shows\nthat, for any H , we have hs = ?. Having dealt with this case, we see that\nsolution of sinhs = 0 is equivalent to solution of cosH = T . We consider two\ncases, depending on whether |T | is greater than or less than 1.\n\nThe Case |T | > 1. If |T | > 1, i.e., |?|+ |?| > 90?, the quantity sinhs cannot\nbe zero for any H . In this case, there is no sunset or sunrise:\n\n\u2022 If T is negative, T < ?1, i.e., |? + ?| > 90?, and\n\nsinhs > 0 ?? hs > 0 .\n\nThe Sun spends the whole day above the horizon. This is the polar day.\n\u2022 If T is positive, T > +1, i.e., |? ? ?| < 90?, and\n\nsinhs < 0 ?? hs < 0 .\n\nThe Sun spends the whole day below the horizon. This is the polar night.\n\nThe Case |T | ? 1. If |T | ? 1, i.e., |?|+ |?| < 90?, (13.21) has two roots:\nsinhs = 0 ?? cosH = T ,\n\ndetermining two opposite values of H , denoted by Hrise and Hset :{\nHset = arccos(? tan ? tan?) ,\nHrise = ?Hset .\n\n\n\n13.3 Sun\u2013Target\u2013Satellite Configuration 633\n\nWith ?s = 90\n? in (13.20), we obtain the corresponding azimuth values:\n\n??\n?\n\n?sset = arccos\n\n(\n? sin ?\ncos?\n\n)\n,\n\n?srise = ??sset .\n\nWe note the following special cases:\n\n\u2022 At the equator (? = 0), we have, for the whole year,\n\nHset = 90\n? , ?sset = 90\n\n? ? ? .\n\n\u2022 At the equinoxes (? = 0), we have, for the whole Earth,\n\nHset = 90\n? , ?sset = 90\n\n? .\n\nRecall that Hset = 90\n? corresponds to sunrise at 06:00 LAT and sunset at\n\n18:00 LAT.\n\nNote. In these calculations, we have not taken into account atmospheric\nrefraction. For medium latitudes (|?| < 55?), and on average over the year,\nrefraction brings the sunrise forward by about 3min and delays the sunset by\nthe same amount.\n\nApparent Noon\n\nApparent noon, or 12:00 LAT, corresponds to H = 0. In all the monthly\ntables showing overpass time at the end of the chapter, where LMT is shown\non the abscissa, we thus have\n\nnoon LMT = noon LAT + ET ,\n\nwhere ET is the equation of time discussed in Chap. 7 [see (7.58) and (7.60)].\nIn these monthly tables, i.e., Figs. 13.12 and 13.13, and also 13.16, 13.17,\n\n13.18, and 13.19, the dashed curve shows the times (LMT) of the sunrise,\nsunset, and apparent solar noon, for the relevant location and during the\nwhole month.\n\n13.3 Sun\u2013Target\u2013Satellite Configuration\n\nScattering Angle\n\n13.3.1 Angles Describing the Sun\u2013Target\u2013Satellite\nConfiguration\n\nFor any point P , the directions of the Sun and satellite at a given time are\ndefined by the four angles ?, ?, ?s, and ?s. When studying certain physical\nphenomena, such as radiation phenomena or those related to questions of\n\n\n\n634 Chapter 13. Spatiotemporal and Angular Sampling\n\nSUN\n\nSATELLITE\n\nZENITH\n\nTarget\n\nPrincipal Plane\n\nFig. 13.8 :Angles used to describe the geometric configuration of the Sun, target, and\n\nsatellite.\n\nremote sensing, it is useful to know that three angles are in fact sufficient to\ncharacterise the geometry of the Sun\u2013target\u2013satellite configuration. These are\nthe two zenith angles and the relative azimuth. Using the standard relations\nhere, we set ??\n\n?\n?0 = ?s ,\n? = |?| ,\n?A = ?s ? ?+ ? [mod 2?] .\n\nDefined in this way, the relative azimuth is zero when the directions are op-\nposite and it is equal to ? when the Sun and the satellite are on the same\nside with respect to the target point (see Fig. 13.8). Most of the phenomena\nstudied are symmetrical with respect to the principal plane, which is the plane\nspanned by the direction of the Sun and the vertical at the target point. We\nthen consider the relative azimuth in the interval [0, ?]. For reasons of clarity,\nwe use ?A to denote the relative azimuth defined in [0, 2?] and ?B to denote\nthe one defined in [0, ?], with\n\n?B = ?A if ?A ? ? , ?B = 2? ? ?A if ?A > ? .\n\nIn radiation studies, when we speak of the relative azimuth without further\nspecification, we are referring to ?B, written ?.\n\nThe scattering angle is the angle between the two directions denoted here\nby PS and PSs. This angle ? takes values in the interval [0, ?]. Its value is\n\n\n\n13.3 Sun\u2013Target\u2013Satellite Configuration 635\n\nfound as for ? with (13.2). Using the above notation,\n\ncos ? = cos ?0 cos ? ? sin ?0 sin ? cos? . (13.22)\n\n13.3.2 Specular Reflection (Sun Glint)\n\nWe speak of specular2 reflection when rays of sunlight, after reflecting on\na surface, end up in the satellite\u2019s onboard detector. This specular reflection,\noften called Sun glint, can cause irreversible damage to instrumentation, but\neven if it does not, radiometric measurements can suffer seriously by not taking\nthis phenomenon into account.\n\nSun glint occurs when the reflecting surface is a liquid surface, like the sea,\nor even a lake or wetland. The glare from Sun glint gives an idea of the state\nof the surface, from calm sea (narrow region of glare with intense reflection) to\nrough waters (broad region with more diffuse reflection). One can thus detect\nregions polluted by oil slicks, as can be seen from Figs. 13.9 and 13.10.\n\nConditions for Specular Reflection\n\nStrictly speaking, reflection occurs when:\n\n\u2022 the directions PS and PSs lie in the same plane, on either side of the\nnormal at P :\n\n?? ?s = ? [mod 2?] , i.e., ? = 0 ,\n\n\u2022 the angles of incidence are equal:\n\n|?| = ?s , i.e., ? = ?0 .\n\nWe call PS?s the reflected solar ray. Its direction is given by the zenith angle\n?s and azimuth angle ?s + ?. If ?\n\n? is the angle between PS?s and PS, we\nobtain its value by a similar calculation to the one leading to ?, whereupon\n\ncos ?? = cos ?0 cos ? + sin ?0 sin ? cos? . (13.23)\n\nWe fix some angle ??0 which specifies the limit of the effect. We then have the\ncondition\n\n?? < ??0 ?? specular reflection possible .\n\nThe two rays PS and PS?s then lie inside a cone of half-aperture ??0/2. To\ngive an order of magnitude, the angle ??0 generally takes values between 12?\n\nand 20?, depending on the situation.\n\n2This adjective, borrowed fromMiddle French, comes from the Latin specularis, adjective\nderived from speculum, meaning \u201cmirror\u201d. This word is itself derived from the verb specere,\nmeaning \u201cto look\u201d (spectacle), which is associated with the Indo-European root *spek, \u201cto\nobserve\u201d. The word spy also derives from this root.\n\n\n\nAqua / MODISAqua / MODIS\nOrbit - Ground track - Sunglint    [ Cone:H-apert: 8.0\u00b0]\n\n2010 07 11 21:00:00 UTC  >>>   1440.0 min =   1.00 day\n\nAcross track swath (XT mode)\n\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24LMT (local) hours 12 JUL\n\nMC LMD\n\nAltitude =  699.5 km\n\ne = 0.000188\n\na = 7077.668 km\n\nIncl. / SUN-S.= 98.19 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =    98.88 min    * rev/day =14.56\n\n**   Half-swath:  55.2\u00b0 [ 2.5] - On ground 1165.0 km [  0.50 min]\n\nAsc.

Spatiotemporal and Angular Sampling\n\nExample 13.8 Specular reflection detected by the instrument MODIS aboard\nthe satellite Aqua.\n\n? The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a multi-\nspectral imager with a pixel of the order of 500m at the nadir. Its swath is\nbroad enough (fM = 55.2\n\n?, i.e., 2FM = 2,330 km on the ground) to observe\nall points on the Earth every day or every 2 days (QE = 0.847). NASA uses\nit aboard the EOS satellites Terra and Aqua for environmental surveillance.\nOn 20 April 2010, the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil platform in the\nGulf of Mexico led to an oil spill lasting several months which turned out to\nbe the biggest such disaster ever seen in the USA.\n\nFigure 13.9 (upper) is an image of this region taken on 12 July 2010 by\nAqua/MODIS. At the top of the image, one can make out the Mississippi\ndelta, and in the center, Mobile Bay, and on the right, the coast of Florida.\nThis provides a perfect example of sun glint. Moreover, the oil slick renders\nthe water surface smoother and intensifies specular reflection.\n\nFigure 13.9 (lower) represents the ground track of Aqua, centering on\nthis region, for the same day. Regions of potential specular reflection are\nindicated (it can only occur on the sea). This shows that the phenomenon\nis very significant in the Gulf of Mexico. Figure 13.10 has been obtained by\nsuperposing the two last images.\n\nLet us consider the geometric aspects of this phenomenon. Table 13.2 gives\nall the angles relevant to the Sun\u2013target\u2013satellite configuration on 10\u201312 July\n2010. The target is located at the center of the sun glint, in the pixel with\ncoordinates 30?N and 90?W, which corresponds to New Orleans, at the mouth\nof the Mississippi. Since the table was established for the CERES instrument,\nwe will not take into account the swaths f > 55.2? for MODIS.\n\nOn 12 July, for overpass n = 37, at 13:08 LMT, the zenith angles are\npractically equal (? = 19? and ?s = 16?), while the relative azimuth is small\n(?A = 14\n\n?). Equation (13.23) gives ?? = 5?, which implies that there will be\nspecular reflection, since the angular bound is ?? < 16? here (cone of half-\naperture 8?).\n\nA little further on, Fig. 13.12 indicates all the cases of specular reflection\nduring the month of July 2010, for New Orleans, with Aqua/MODIS, viz.,\n3, 12, 19, and 28 July, shortly after 13:00 LMT. With Terra/MODIS, for the\nsame location, see Fig. 13.13: the same phenomenon occurs likewise on 2, 9,\n18, and 25 July, at around 11:00 LMT. ?\n\nExample 13.9 Specular reflection detected by the instrument MADRAS aboard\nthe satellite Megha-tropiques.\n\n?

We now give a series of examples.\n\nExample 13.10 Monthly sampling tables for a wide swath instrument aboard\nthe Sun-synchronous satellites Terra and Aqua, for a point with latitude 30?N.\n\n\n\n640 Chapter 13.

The CERES instrument scans across track. It has a half-swath fM = 61.8?\n\nso that ?M = 78.0\n?. The overlap fraction is QE = 1.35 when the instrument\n\nis aboard a satellite on a Terra-type orbit.\n\nAqua/CERES. For the satellite Aqua, we consider the following initial con-\nditions (provided by NORAD):\n\n2010 07 12 20:38:35.423 UT, ?AN = 254.4722\n? (?AN = 13:36 LMT) .\n\nWe calculate the sampling for the point P with coordinates 30.0?N and\n90.0?W (New Orleans), in order to establish Sun glint conditions as discussed\nabove. The monthly table is drawn up for July, from D = 1 (corresponding to\nthe date 2010 07 01) to D = 31. For each overpass, we calculate the overpass\ntime (UT then LMT) and the angles specifying the satellite\u2013target\u2013Sun con-\nfiguration. The results for several consecutive overpasses are shown in Table\n13.2. The values for the whole month (31 days, whatever the month) are rep-\nresented in the monthly sampling table in Fig. 13.12. In this table, the LMT\ntimes are given from 0 to 24 on the abscissa axis and the days from 1 to 31 on\nthe ordinate axis. Each point (triangle with apex at the top or the bottom)\ncorresponds to an overpass, dashes (long or short) refer to the target\u2013satellite\ndirection, and small circles (white or black) refer to the target\u2013Sun direction.\nDot-dashed lines indicate the times of sunrise and sunset, as well as the local\napparent noon, while the slight difference between LAT noon and LMT noon\nillustrates the equation of time [see (7.58) and (7.60)].\n\nNote that, for this latitude, on almost every day, there are almost three\noverpasses per day (97 overpasses in 31 days), of which one or two occur\nduring the day (between 12:00 and 14:00 LMT) and two or one during the\nnight (between 1 and 3 o\u2019clock), alternately.\n\nThe recurrence cycle CTo = 16 days is clearly visible. On days D and\nD + 16, we find the same values of ? and ?. Moreover, since the satellite is\nSun-synchronous, we also find the same values of the LMT time.\n\nSpecular reflection (?? < 16?) occurs on 3 and 19 (= 3+16) and also on 12\nand 28 (= 12 + 16). The Sun glint of 12 July was discussed in Example 13.8\nand illustrated in Figs. 13.9 and 13.10.\n\nTerra/CERES. For the satellite Terra, on the same orbit as Aqua, we have\nused contemporaneous NORAD initial data. We calculate the sampling with\nan identical CERES instrument to the one aboard Aqua (cross-track scan-\nning). The monthly table in Fig. 13.13 for this same point P , with coordinates\n30.0?N and 90.0?W, shows a sampling that can be described as \u201csymmetrical\u201d\nwith respect to the one for Aqua. We find three overpasses per day, during\nthe day (between 10 and 12 o\u2019clock LMT) and the night (between 21:00 and\n23:00), alternately.\n\nAverage Number of Overpasses per Day. For a given meridian, Fig. 13.14\nshows the average number N(?, fM) of overpasses per day as a function of the\nlatitude ?, from the North Pole to the South Pole, for the CERES instrument\n\n\n\n642 Chapter 13. Spatiotemporal and Angular Sampling\n\naboard Aqua (or Terra). For the maximum half-swath fM = 61.8\n? of this\n\ninstrument (continuous curve), the graph of N(?, fM) shows an almost flat\nminimum around the equator, then increases towards the poles. Beyond ? =\n82?, each point is viewed on each revolution of the satellite. In the same figure,\nwe have plotted the graphs of N(?, f) with dotted, dashed, and dot-dashed\ncurves for f = 3fM/4, f = fM/2, and f = fM/4. Using (12.27), we may check\nthat N(0, fM) = 2QE = 2.71. ?\n\nExample 13.11 Asymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres\nregarding the overpass time of a Sun-synchronous satellite.\n\n? The instrument known as Ve?ge?tation, or Vegetation Monitoring Instrument\n(VMI), is an imager with cross-track swath, fM = 50.5\n\n?, carried aboard the re-\ncurrent (CTo = 26 day) and Sun-synchronous (?AN = 22:30) satellite SPOT-4.\nFigure 13.15 is a monthly table with the days of the month on the horizon-\ntal axis and latitudes on the vertical axis. We consider a given time slot and\nnote overpass times with triangles and angles ? with line segments. The time\nslot was of 2.5 h on either side of noon. This is the most favourable period\nfor image acquisition. It is easy to see why the northern hemisphere has the\nadvantage over the southern, through the choice of ?AN (in this respect, see\nFig. 10.14 and explanations concerning preferences for ?AN). The recurrence\ncycle of 26 is clearly visible, as is the 5 day subcycle. ?\n\nExample 13.12 Monthly sampling tables for an instrument with medium\nswath aboard a near-polar satellite (MetOp-A), for locations at various lat-\nitudes.\n\n? The IASI (Interfe?rome?tre atmosphe?rique de sondage infrarouge) is a Michel-\nson interferometer measuring the spectral distribution of atmospheric radia-\ntion. Its cross-track swath can be described as medium amplitude (between\nbroad and narrow), with fM = 48.3\n\n?, whence ?M = 57.4? and QE = 0.73. It\nis currently operating aboard MetOp-A and MetOp-B and is also planned for\nMetOp-C.\n\nThe satellite MetOp-A is recurrent (CTo = 29 day) and Sun-synchronous\n(?AN = 21:30). We consider the NORAD initial data ?AN = 266.3619\n\n? =\n93.64?W at 03:43:01.457 UT (whence ?AN = 21:28 LMT), on 1 April 2013,\nand establish the monthly sampling tables for the meridian ?AN:\n\n\u2022 On the equator (see Fig. 13.16), there is roughly one overpass and a half\nevery day for this instrument (45 overpasses in 31 days):\n\nN(0, fM) = 2QE = 1.46 .\n\nThe satellite passes through the zenith for D = 1 (initial data) and again\nfor D = 30, showing that the cycle is indeed 29 days.

Overpasses in time slot, with viewing angle.\n\n\n\n13.4 Monthly Sampling Tables 647\n\n\u2022 For high latitudes, such as ? = 70? (see Fig. 13.17), there are slightly fewer\nthan six daily overpasses (162 overpasses in 31 days), occurring in two\nbatches of three consecutive overpasses.\n\n?\n\nExample 13.13 Monthly sampling tables for an instrument with medium\nswath aboard a low-inclination satellite (Megha-Tropiques) over two consecu-\ntive months.\n\n? The satellite Megha-Tropiques has inclination 20?. We consider the NO-\nRAD initial data: ?AN = 11:18 (LMT) on the date 2013 06 01 and ?AN = 21:05\n(LMT) on the date 2013 07 01. The ScaRaB instrument has a swath of medium\namplitude, with fM = 48.9\n\n?, whence ?M = 58.9? and QE = 2.09. We consider\noverpasses for the point P with geographic coordinates ? = 75?, ? = 12?N.\nFor such a latitude, with this satellite/instrument configuration, there are\nmore than six overpasses per day during consecutive revolutions:\n\n\u2022 Looking at the monthly tables for June and July in Figs. 13.18 and 13.19,\nwe see the influence of nodal precession on the overpass times (D = 31\nfor June corresponds to D = 1 for July). The value of ?? calculated above\ninduces a cycle relative to the Sun equal to CS = ?51.3 days. This means\nthat the overpass time moves forward by 28min on average from 1 day to\nthe next, or by 14 h a month. After 51 days, we return to the same overpass\ntimes.\n\n\u2022 Figure 13.20 shows the average number N(?, fM) of overpasses per day\nas a function of the latitude ? and the half-swath fM. We have replaced\nthe ScaRaB instrument aboard Megha-Tropiques by an instrument viewing\nfrom limb to limb and called here FOV max (maximal field of view). For\nthe maximal half-swath fM = f0 = 61.7\n\n? (continuous curve), the graph\nN(?, f0) has a flat maximum around the equator. We are then in a situation\nthat may prove useful (and novel): between 8?N and 8?S, every point is\nviewed during each revolution, i.e., 13.1 times a day. On the same figure, we\nhave plotted the graphs ofN(?, f) (dotted, dashed, and dot-dashed curves)\nfor f = 3fM/4 (a value that corresponds roughly to that of ScaRaB),\nf = fM/2, and f = fM/4. The slightly shaky aspect of the graphs comes\nfrom the fact that the recurrence cycle is short, being just 7 days.\n\nNote. As the nodal period Td is equal to 101.93min, the number of round\ntrips per day is ? = 14.1. Since the satellite orbits in the prograde sense, i.e.,\nthe same sense as the Earth, it only crosses a meridian ? ? 1 times a day.\nThe average daily frequency of intersection of the meridian is thus equal to\n13.1 here (if the satellite had inclination i = 160?, it would cross the meridian\n15.1 times a day). The period T ? obtained from this frequency represents the\nsynodic period of the satellite and the Earth. ?\n\n\n\n648 Chapter 13.

Overpass statistics.\n\n\n\nChapter 14\n\nGlobal Positioning Systems\n\n(GPS)\n\n14.1 Basic Principle of GPS\n\nPositioning by GPS is based on a very simple principle. However, a very\nhigh level of technological knowhow is required to make it work. In fact, almost\nevery field of modern physics is involved in some way. This satellite-based\nsystem requires:\n\n\u2022 very accurate knowledge of satellite positions,\n\u2022 very accurate clocks aboard each satellite.\n\nThe satellites send an electromagnetic signal and the user has a receiver\nequipped with a clock. (We shall see that this clock does not need to be par-\nticularly accurate.) Recall that an electromagnetic signal travels in vacuum\nat the speed of light c, and thus travels 30 cm in 1 ns (or 10?9 s):\n\n0.3m ?? 1 ns .\n\n14.1.1 Positioning in the Ideal Case\n\nThe position of the satellites Si is known at each instant of time. The\nposition P of the receiver is unknown. We begin by considering the ideal\ncase:\n\n1. The satellite S1 sends a signal at time t1 and it is received at P at time\nt?1. The receiver P , using its clock which measures t\n\n?\n1 and the message sent\n\nM. Capderou, Handbook of Satellite Orbits: From Kepler to GPS,\nDOI 10.1007/978-3-319-03416-4 14,\n\u00a9 Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014\n\n653\n\n\n\n654 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\nby S1 at time t1, obtains the time ?t1 = t\n?\n1 ? t1, which corresponds to the\n\ndistance r1 = ?S1P ? :\n\nc?t1 = ?S1P ? . (14.1)\n\nThe point P is thus located on the sphere ?1 of radius r1 centered on S1.\n2. Likewise, the satellite S2 sends a signal, and by measuring the time interval\n\n?t2, this tells us that P lies on the sphere ?2 of radius r2 centered on S2.\nThe point P is thus on the intersection of the spheres ?1 and ?2, which is\na circle.\n\n3. With the satellite S3, we obtain a third sphere ?3, whose intersection with\n(?1 ? ?2) gives just two points P ? and P ??. One of these two points is\ntherefore P . The ambiguity between P ? and P ?? is easily removed, because\none of these two points will be situated in a quite impossible location to\nbe identified with P , e.g., at an altitude of 35,000 km.\n\nIn this ideal case, three satellites therefore suffice to locate P . However, to\nachieve this, the clock at P would have to have the same quality as those\ncarried aboard the satellites, and this would be impossible because such clocks\nare cumbersome and very expensive. A fourth satellite is thus needed to make\nup for the inaccuracy of this clock.\n\n14.1.2 Positioning in Real Situations\n\nThere are two main differences with the ideal case just considered:\n\n\u2022 The clock at P is not perfect and there is a synchronisation error.\n\u2022 To reach P , the wave emitted by the satellite must cross the Earth\u2019s atmo-\n\nsphere, and this slows the signal down.\n\nLet us just reconsider the logic here. The Cartesian coordinates of P denoted\nby x, y, and z, are unknown. The coordinates xi, yi, and zi, of the satellite\nSi are known, and the index i takes values from 1 to n, since we consider\nn satellites. We denote the unit vector in the direction SiP by ei and set\nri = ?SiP ?. Then\n\nSiP =\n\n?\n?x? xiy ? yi\n\nz ? zi\n\n?\n? , ei =\n\n?\n?ai1 = (x? xi)/riai2 = (y ? yi)/ri\n\nai3 = (z ? zi)/ri\n\n?\n? . (14.2)\n\nEquation (14.1) for the ideal case becomes\n\nc?ti = ?SiP ?+ c?t+ c\n3?\n\nk=1\n\n?k,it (14.3)\n\n\n\n14.1 Basic Principle of GPS 655\n\nin the real case, where we make the following explanatory remarks:\n\n\u2022 The synchronisation error ?t of the receiver\u2019s clock, which may be positive\nor negative, is independent of the given satellite and leads to an error in\nthe distance called the clock bias. This is given by\n\nb = c?t . (14.4)\n\n\u2022 The time delays ?k,i depend on the satellite Si and the index k distinguishes\nthree different effects:\n\n\u2013 ?1,it in crossing the ionosphere,\n\u2013 ?2,it in crossing the troposphere,\n\u2013 ?3,it due to effects of special and general relativity.\n\nWe shall see below how it is possible to measure ?1,i, evaluate ?2,i, and cal-\nculate ?3,i, the weak point of the correction being ?2,i. But for the moment,\nwe shall take these quantities as being determined.\n\nFinally, we rewrite (14.3) with known values on the left and unknowns on\nthe right:\n\nc?ti ? c\n3?\n\nk=1\n\n?k,it = ri + b . (14.5)\n\nThe term on the left, a sum of known (measured or evaluated) quantities, is\ncalled the pseudo-distance or pseudo-range and it is denoted by ?i. The prefix\n\u201cpseudo\u201d is justified by the fact that ?i is not equal to the actual distance ri,\nwhose value is required, but rather to ri plus the (positive or negative) clock\nbias. For the satellite Si, we thus have\n\n?i = ri + b =\n?\n(x? xi)2 + (y ? yi)2 + (z ? zi)2 + b . (14.6)\n\nWith four satellites, we obtain four equations, sufficient to solve for the four\nunknowns x, y, z, and b.\n\nSolution for Four Satellites\n\nA standard method for solving four equations in four unknowns is to lin-\nearise the equations. To do this, one must know an approximate position for\nP , denoted here by P? , with coordinates x?, y?, and z?, and also an approximate\nvalue for the bias b?. Then,\n\nx = x?+ dx , y = y? + dy , z = z? + dz , b = b?+ db ,\n\nwhich yields ?i = ??i + d?i. We obtain d?i by differentiating ?i :\n\nd?i = dri + db .\n\n\n\n656 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\nFor the distance,\n\ndri =\n?ri\n?x\n\ndx+\n?ri\n?y\n\ndy +\n?ri\n?z\n\ndz .\n\nApplied to the point P? , this gives\n\ndri =\n(x?? xi)dx+ (y? ? yi)dy + (z? ? zi)dz?\n\n(x?? xi)2 + (y? ? yi)2 + (z? ? zi)2\n,\n\nwhich can also be written\n\ndri = ai1dx+ ai2dy + ai3dz ,\n\nwhere the coefficients aij , j = 1, 2, 3 are the direction cosines of the given\ndirection, i.e., from the satellite Si to the point P? [see (14.2)].\n\nWe consider the corresponding finite increments: the four pseudo-ranges\n??i represent the measured quantities, while ?x, ?y, ?z, and ?b are now the\nfour unknowns. The system of four linear equations in four unknowns is then,\nfor i=1\u20134,\n\n??i = ai1?x+ ai2?y + ai3?z + ?b .\n\nIn matrix form, this becomes?\n???\n\n??1\n??2\n??3\n??4\n\n?\n??? =\n\n?\n???\na11 a12 a13 1\na21 a22 a23 1\na31 a32 a33 1\na41 a42 a43 1\n\n?\n???\u00d7\n\n?\n???\n\n?x\n?y\n?z\n?b\n\n?\n??? , (14.7)\n\nwhere the direction cosines are written as follows:\n\nai1 =\nx?? xi\n??i ? b?\n\n, ai2 =\ny? ? yi\n??i ? b?\n\n, ai3 =\nz? ? zi\n??i ? b?\n\n.\n\nThis can be written in an equivalent compact notation:\n\n\u2022 The vector ?R contains the elements ??i.\n\u2022 The vector ?X contains the unknowns ?x, ?y, ?z, and ?b.\n\u2022 The 4\u00d7 4 matrix A contains the elements aij .\n\nWith this, we have simply\n\n?R = A?X . (14.8)\n\nWe then calculate the inverse of the matrix A and use it to obtain the required\nresult:\n\n?X = A?1?R . (14.9)\n\nIn practice, P? is taken to be the previous value of P . To initialise, we choose an\napproximate value of P and refine the result by successive iteration, varying\nx?, y?, z?, and b? so as to minimise ??X?.\n\n\n\n14.1 Basic Principle of GPS 657\n\nSolution for n Satellites\n\nThe satellites have orbits such that, apart from certain special cases, any\npoint P can see about ten GPS satellites at any given time. We then have a\nsystem of n equations (with n > 4) available to determine the four unknowns\nof the vector ?R. The matrix equation (14.7) thus becomes\n\n?\n?????????\n\n??1\n??2\n...\n\n??j\n...\n\n??n\n\n?\n?????????\n\n=\n\n?\n?????????\n\na11 a12 a13 1\na21 a22 a23 1\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\naj1 aj2 aj3 1\n...\n\n...\n...\n\n...\nan1 an2 an3 1\n\n?\n?????????\n\n\u00d7\n\n?\n???\n\n?x\n?y\n?z\n?b\n\n?\n??? . (14.10)\n\nWith the previous notation, this can be written\n\n?R = A?X .\n\nHowever, in this case, we cannot obtain ?X directly, because the matrix A\nis not square. In fact the system is overdetermined, because there are more\nequations than unknowns.\n\nWe use the transpose TA of A to obtain the result\n\n?X =\n[\nTAA\n\n]?1 TA?R . (14.11)\nThe solution obtained is the best approximation in the sense of least squares\nto the solution of (14.10). Using this approach, we consider all the equations\nto be equivalent. A more refined method, better suited to the problem, is to\nweight each equation, giving greater weight to satellites viewed with maximal\nelevation. (The weight is roughly proportional to the cosine of the viewing\nzenith angle.) But the best suited approach for this kind of problem uses\nalgorithms like Kalman filters.\n\nGPS Time Base\n\nSolution of (14.10) by (14.11) yields the desired coordinates of the point P ,\nbut also ?b, whence we may determine the clock bias and reset the receiver\u2019s\nclock relative to the atomic clocks carried by the satellite constellation. The\nuser thus has access to a highly accurate clock and we thereby obtain an\nexcellent time base, common to the whole planet.\n\nPhase Measurement\n\nOn the wave carrying the signal, with wavelength of the order of 20 cm, the\nphase of the signal received by the receiver is compared with the phase of the\nsignal emitted by the satellite. We shall not enter into further details on this\ntechnique, which considerably improves positioning accuracy (see Table 14.3).\n\n\n\n658 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\n14.1.3 Determining User Velocity\n\nSince the position of P is known at each instant of time (the GPS signal\nis sent every millisecond), it would be possible to calculate the instantaneous\nvelocity from the definition ?l/?t, but this is not the method actually used,\nbecause uncertainties in the position would generate too much error in the\nvelocity. It is better to use the Doppler effect, which can provide much more\naccurate results. Since the velocity of the satellite is known, the modification\nof the received signal can be used to obtain the receiver velocity to high\naccuracy. However, the position of P must first be determined before carrying\nout the velocity calculation.\n\nThe velocity of the point P (the user) is denoted by U and that of the\nsatellite Si by V i, whence\n\nU =\n\n?\n? x?y?\n\nz?\n\n?\n? , V i =\n\n?\n? x?iy?i\n\nz?i\n\n?\n? . (14.12)\n\nThe satellite Si emits a signal at frequency f0i which is received by P at\nfrequency fRi. The relative change in frequency due to the Doppler effect is\nequal to the ratio of the relative velocity projected onto the line of propagation\nof the signal to the velocity of propagation of the signal, which is of course c,\nthe velocity of light:\n\nf0i ? fRi\nf0i\n\n=\nV reli \u00b7ei\n\nc\n, (14.13)\n\nwhere V reli = V i ?U is the relative velocity and ei is the unit vector defined\nby (14.2).\n\nThe clock of the receiver P generally undergoes an unknown drift, leading\nto a corresponding drift in the received frequency fRi. We have\n\nfRi = fi\n\n(\n1 +\n\nb?\n\nc\n\n)\n, (14.14)\n\nwhere fi is the frequency measured by the receiver and b?/c is dimensionless,\nbeing the ratio of two velocities. We thus have\n\nc\nf0i ? fi(1 + b?/c)\n\nf0i\n= V i\u00b7ei ?U \u00b7 ei .\n\nThis is rewritten in such a way that:\n\n\u2022 the known quantities fi (measured), and f0i and V i (communicated by the\nsatellite Si) appear on the left,\n\n\u2022 the four unknowns b? and the three components of U appear on the right.\n\n\n\n14.1 Basic Principle of GPS 659\n\nSetting ?i = fi/f0i, we obtain\n\nc(?i ? 1) + V i\u00b7ei = U \u00b7 ei ? ?ib? . (14.15)\nTo simplify the notation, we introduce the term wi which may be considered\nas a pseudo-velocity:\n\nwi = ai1x?i + ai2y?i + ai3z?i + c(?i ? 1) , (14.16)\n\nand then write (14.15) in the form\n\nwi = ai1x?+ ai2y? + ai3z? ? ?ib? . (14.17)\n\nThe term ?i is very close\n1 to unity. In the definition (14.16) of wi, the term\n\nc(?i ? 1) is the hallmark of the Doppler effect, but in (14.17), ?ib? can be\nreplaced by b? and this equation becomes\n\nwi = ai1x?+ ai2y? + ai3z? ? b? . (14.18)\n\nTo begin with we assume that there are four satellites, the minimum for\ndetermining velocities. We then obtain the matrix equation?\n\n???\nw1\nw2\nw3\nw4\n\n?\n??? =\n\n?\n???\na11 a12 a13 1\na21 a22 a23 1\na31 a32 a33 1\na41 a42 a43 1\n\n?\n???\u00d7\n\n?\n???\n\nx?\ny?\nz?\n\n?b?\n\n?\n??? . (14.19)\n\nThe 4 \u00d7 4 matrix is the same as the matrix A in (14.7). Indeed, (14.19)\nis obtained by differentiating (14.7) with respect to time while fixing the\ndirection cosines.\n\nIn view of a more compact notation, we define:\n\n\u2022 the vector W whose components are the pseudo-velocities wi,\n\u2022 the vector X? whose components are the unknowns x?, y?, z?, and b?, and which\n\ncan be considered to correspond to d(?X)/dt,\n\u2022 the 4\u00d7 4 matrix A.\n\nThen we may write\n\nW = AX? . (14.20)\n\nSince the inverse of A has already been found in the position determination,\nwe obtain\n\nX? = A?1W . (14.21)\n\nWith more than four satellites, as for the position calculation, we use TA or\nthe Kalman filter method.\n\n1The velocity of a Navstar/GPS satellite is 3.9 km/s in a Galilean frame. In a terrestrial\nframe, the relative velocity ?V reli ? is of this order, whence we find V reli /c ? 10?5.\n\n\n\n660 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\n14.1.4 Perturbation of Signal and Measurement\n\nEffects Due to the Ionosphere\n\nThe ionosphere is a region of the atmosphere located roughly between\naltitudes 60 and 800km. Gases there are highly ionised under the effects of\nsolar radiation. The pressure varies between 2 and 10?6Pa depending on the\naltitude. The ionosphere is a dispersive medium, meaning that the speed of\npropagation of an electromagnetic wave will depend on its frequency. To mea-\nsure the perturbation on the signal due to the ionosphere, Si transmits a dual\nfrequency wave, i.e., at two different frequencies f ? and f ??. The time differ-\nence for the two frequencies to arrive can be used to calculate the ionospheric\ncontribution ?1,it to the signal delay.2\n\nEffects Due to the Troposphere\n\nThe troposphere is the region of the atmosphere directly enveloping the\nEarth\u2019s surface, in which weather phenomena take place, e.g., wind, cloud,\nrain, and so on. It contains about 80% of the mass of the atmosphere and its\nupper bound is the tropopause, at which the temperature variation reverses.\nThe altitude of the tropopause is about 8 km at the poles and 16 km at the\nequator, and varies with the season.\n\nThis is a non-dispersive medium. The signal is delayed by crossing the\ntroposphere, and of course the distance travelled depends on the viewing con-\n\n2Let ??i and ?\n??\ni be the pseudo-ranges measured for the frequencies f\n\n? and f ??, respectively,\nand let ri be the geometric distance between the satellite Si and the receiver P :\n\n??i = ri + ?r\n?\ni +?ri , ?\n\n??\ni = ri + ?r\n\n??\ni +?ri ,\n\nwhere ?ri is the sum of the delays due to causes other than the ionosphere and where\n?r?i and ?r??i are the delays due to crossing the ionosphere, which depend on the frequency.\n(These are generally between 1 and 40m, depending on the time, the day, the location, and\nthe viewing configurations.) It can be shown that these discrepancies ?ri are proportional\nto f?2. Therefore,\n\n?r?i =\nAi\n\nf ?2\n, ?r??i =\n\nAi\n\nf ??2\n,\n\nwhence\n\n?r??i =\n(\n\nf ?\n\nf ??\n\n)2\n?r?i .\n\nBy measuring ??i and ?\n??\ni , and using the known ratio of the frequencies, ?r\n\n?\ni can be determined\n\nfrom\n\n??i ? ???i = ?r?i ? ?r??i = ?r?i\n\n[\n1?\n(\n\nf ?\n\nf ??\n\n)2]\n, ?r?i =\n\n??i ? ???i\n1? (f ?/f ??)2\n\n,\n\nso that, with our notation, ?r?i = c?1,it.\n\n\n\n14.1 Basic Principle of GPS 661\n\nfiguration, i.e., whether the satellite is low or high above the horizon. The time\ndifference that we have denoted by ?2,it is divided into two parts, one for the\ndry atmosphere and the other for water vapour. The contribution of the dry\natmosphere can be quite well modelled, but the wet atmosphere is another\nmatter, proving very complex to evaluate, since it depends on local meteoro-\nlogical phenomena. We shall see later that it is the differential GPS that best\ndeals with this source of error.\n\nRelativistic Effects\n\nIn an appendix at the end of the chapter (see Sect. 14.11), we explain\nhow relativistic effects can be taken into account. Even though the theoretical\nconcepts may be complex, they are perfectly understood and the inherent\ncorrections can be made with great accuracy. There is almost no error in the\nterm ?3,it.\n\n14.1.5 Geometric Considerations and Measurement\nAccuracy\n\nThe fundamental situations involved in satellite positioning can be under-\nstood from elementary considerations of geometry, the subject of this section.\n\nClock Correction\n\nAs we saw earlier, the user\u2019s clock is of average quality. This leads to what\nwe called clock bias in (14.4), which is fully determined by the system of\nequations in (14.7) or (14.10). Here we discuss a simple and clever illustration\nof how clock bias can be reduced. We consider a simplified situation where the\nreceiver P is on a spherical Earth. Three satellites Si are visible to P . Each\nsphere of center Si intersects the Earth\u2019s sphere in a circle.\n\nFigure 14.1 shows three possible situations regarding clock synchronisation:\n\n\u2022 If the receiver clock is perfectly synchronised with the satellite clock, the\nthree circles intersect exactly at P .\n\n\u2022 If the receiver clock is slow, the receiver underestimates the distances ri\nand the circles form a concave triangle containing P .\n\n\u2022 If the receiver clock is fast, the receiver overestimates the distances ri and\nthe circles form a convex triangle containing P .\n\nGiven that the three circles should meet at P , the clock discrepancy is cor-\nrected in such a way as to minimise the error triangle.\n\nViewing Geometry and Accuracy\n\nThe basic principle of GPS exploits the intersection of spheres. A simplified\ngeometrical study can give an insight into the accuracy of horizontal and\nvertical positioning.\n\nWe consider two spheres centered on S1 and S2, represented here by two\ncircles whose intersection determines P (see Fig. 14.2). Each circle is shown\n\n\n\n662 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nI????  A????\n\nFig. 14.1 :Localisation of the receiver P by intersecting circles in various cases. Up-\n\nper: Clock at P is slow relative to the satellite clock. Center: Clocks are perfectly\n\nsynchronised. Lower: Clock at P is fast relative to satellite clock.\n\n\n\n14.1 Basic Principle of GPS 663\n\nS1\n\nS1\n\nS2\n\nS2\n\nFig. 14.2 :Determining the point P\n\nby the intersection of two circles.\n\nLeft: With a high level of accuracy.\n\nRight: With a low level of accuracy.\n\nwith its margin of error. In the situation on the left, where the intersection\nis obtained by two arcs that are almost orthogonal, the margin of error is\nquite small. However, in the situation on the right, where the intersection is\nobtained by two arcs that are almost parallel, the margin of error is rather\nlarge.\n\nWhen we determine a point on the Earth\u2019s surface, in the local horizontal\nplane, we generally find ourselves in the first of these two situations (Fig. 14.2\nleft), where S1, S2, and the spheres are represented projected onto the local\nhorizontal plane. But to determine the altitude of a point, we are generally\nin the second situation (Fig. 14.2 right), where the elements of the figure are\nprojected in a local vertical plane. For this reason, altitude determinations\ntend to be less accurate than horizontal position determinations.\n\n14.1.6 Position on Earth and Geographic Coordinates\n\nSolving (14.10) yields the position of the point P in Cartesian coordinates.\nTo transform to geographic coordinates, i.e., longitude, latitude, and altitude,\nthe main difficulty comes from the fact that the Earth is a geoid. Here we\nconsider the case where the Earth is treated as an ellipsoid and calculate the\ngeodetic coordinates.\n\nThe point P is at altitude h above the reference ellipsoid. The geodetic\nlatitude of P is given by the direction PH (angle of PH with the equatorial\nplane), where H is the foot of the normal to the ellipsoid at P . With the\nnotation in Fig. 14.3, the geodetic height (or geodetic altitude) of P is h = HP .\nIt is obtained from the intersection of the ellipsoid with the grand normal\nN = PI, rather than with PO.\n\n\n\n664 Chapter 14.

The length IH is the great normal N , z?z the polar axis, and xOy the\nequatorial plane.\n\nThe method for obtaining h and the latitude ?, iterative or otherwise, was\ndiscussed in detail in Chap. 2 (see Fig. 2.5 and Table 2.4). Since the longitude\ncan be obtained directly from (2.30), the point P is thereafter determined by\nits local geodetic coordinates (?, ?, h).\n\n14.1.7 Differential GPS (DGPS)\n\nDifferential GPS (DGPS) makes use of base stations. Figure 14.4 illustrates\nthe main idea. Consider a base station at point A whose geographic position\nX0 is known to great accuracy by conventional geodesy. A GPS receiver is\nplaced atA, whence the position of its antenna is known to within a millimeter.\nThe position of A is then measured by GPS and the result denoted by XGPS.\nThe difference of position is then\n\n?0X = XGPS ?X0 . (14.22)\n\n\n\n14.1 Basic Principle of GPS 665\n\nS1\n\nP\n\nA\n\nS2\n\nG\n\nS3\n\nFig. 14.4 :Differential GPS.\n\nThe base station A and the\n\nreceiver P receive the GPS\n\nsignal of the satellites Si.\n\nThe position correction is\n\nsent from A to P . In the case\n\nof the so-called augmentation\n\nsystems, it is sent to the\n\ngeostationary satellite G.\n\nIt will not generally be zero, because there is a certain error in the GPS\nposition estimate. From what was said above, the only cause of this error\n?0X will be inaccurate modelling of the signal as it crosses the troposphere.3\n\nWeather conditions are considered to be roughly the same over a radius of\nabout a 100 km. The base station A sends the correction ?0X by radio to the\nreceivers P which take it into account to refine their position. The maximal\ndistance AP is of the order of a few hundred kilometers. This method, called\nDGPS, can significantly improve accuracy.\n\nWhen DGPS had just begun, the base stations were installed in coastal\nlighthouses. Later they were set up in airports and generalised to other sites.4\n\nA further development of DGPS are the so-called augmentation systems: cor-\nrections are transmitted to a geostationary satellite which retransmits them\nover wide areas. We shall discuss these WAAS systems when we have described\nthe various GPS satellite constellations.\n\n3When the \u201ccivilian\u201d GPS signal was downgraded to deliberately limit positioning ac-\ncuracy, DGPS provided a way to get around this jamming. Accuracy could be improved\nfrom 100 to 22m.\n\n4In the USA, the NDGPS (Nationwide DGPS) uses a 100 or so base stations and covers\nalmost the whole territory. The following system HA-NDGPS (High Accuracy NDGPS)\nshould provide submeter positioning accuracy, i.e., of the order of a few decimeters. The\nsystem known as RTK (Real Time Kinetic) requires a costly base station to be set up close\nto the operating center, but provides accuracies of the order of 10 cm.\n\n\n\n666 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\n14.2 Navstar/GPS\n\nThe system known as Navigation Satellite Time and Ranging/Global\nPositioning System (Navstar/GPS) was set up by the US government under\nthe direction of the Department of Defense (DoD). The original idea was to re-\nbuild a global positioning system on the basis of new principles, going beyond\nthe system provided by Transit, which had reached its limits.5 Positioning by\nDoppler effect was abandoned in favour of triangulation, as exposed above.\nSuch a radical improvement was made possible by the enormous progress in\nconstruction of ultra-precise clocks.\n\n14.2.1 Setting up the System\n\nMain Dates\n\nThe first studies date back to the 1960s, and the system was finally devel-\noped in the 1970s with launch of the first experimental satellites6 when the\nDoD took over the US Navy\u2019s Timation system.\n\nFrom 1978, the GPS system7 gradually began to take shape with the\nsatellites of Block I, which were research and development satellites. The\nBlock II satellites were functional and operational on the characteristic orbit\nof the Navstar/GPS satellites from 1989.\n\n5Navstar is run by the US Air Force, while Transit was managed by the US Navy.\n6The two experimental Time Navigation (Timation) satellites were part of a trial by\n\nthe US Navy to find an alternative to Transit. These satellites followed a very specific\norbit, with h = 900 km, i = 70.0?: Timation-1, launched on 31 May 1967, Timation-2,\non 30 September 1969. The two Navstar Technology Satellites (NTS) of the US Air Force\nfollowed MEO orbits which prefigured the Navstar orbit: NTS-1 (or Timation-3, OPS/7518,\nP73-3), launched on 14 July 1974, h = 13,610 km, i = 125.2?, NTS-2 (P76-4), launched on\n23 June 1977 on a neighbouring orbit to the one adopted for the first GPS missions, with\nh = 20,186 km, i = 63.9?. NTS-2 is discussed further in the appendix of Sect. 14.11.\n\n7List of Navstar/GPS satellites:\n\n\u2022 The 11 satellites of Block I, on the circular orbit h = 20,020 km, i = 63.0?, from Navstar-\n1 (GPS-1, OPS/5111), launched on 22 February 1978, to Navstar-11 (GPS-11, USA-10)\non 9 October 1985.\n\n\u2022 The 28 satellites of Block II and II-A, h=20,020 km, i=55.0?, from Navstar-2-1 (GPS-\n14, USA-35), launched on 14 February 1989, to Navstar-2A-19 (GPS-38, USA-135) on 6\nNovember 1997.\n\n\u2022 The 21 satellites of Block II-R and II-RM, on the same orbit, from Navstar-2R-2 (GPS-\n43, USA-132), launched on 23 July 1997, to Navstar-2R-21 (GPS-50, USA-206, Navstar-\n2RM-8) on 17 August 2009.\n\n\u2022 The 12 satellites of Block II-F, from Navstar-2F-1 (GPS-62, USA-213), launched on 28\nMay 2010, to Navstar-2F-12, for after 2015.\n\n\u2022 The eight satellites of Block III-A, still on the same orbit, from Navstar-3A-1 to Navstar-\n3A-8, from 2014.\n\nBlock II: A (advanced), R (replenishment), RM (R modernized), F (follow-on).\n\n\n\n14.2 Navstar/GPS 667\n\nOn 17 July 1995, the constellation of 24 satellites (only Block II) was com-\nplete and the system declared operational (full operational capability FOC).\nIt had been 21 years since the launch of NTS-1 and it had taken more than\n30 years of research and ingenuity to go from the idea of a global positioning\nsystem to a fully operational satellite implementation.\n\nAnother important date was 2 May 2000. It was on this day that US Pres-\nident Bill Clinton decided to suppress the deliberate strategic downgrading of\nthe signal. Standard accuracy went from 100 to 22m.\n\nPosition determinations by GPS are continually being refined thanks to\ntechnological improvements, such as more powerful signals and better cor-\nrections for atmospheric perturbations, but also due to progress in signal\nprocessing.\n\nSegments of the System\n\nThe positioning system has three segments:\n\n\u2022 the space segment, comprising the satellite constellation,\n\u2022 the control segment, consisting of control and monitor stations,\n\u2022 the user segment, representing all military and civilian users.\n\n14.2.2 Space Segment\n\nThe Navstar/GPS constellation is made up of 24 satellites, in 6 planes of\n4 satellites each. Any point on the Earth is able to view 4 to 8 satellites at\nthe same time, and up to 11 in some cases, with a minimal viewing elevation\nof 15?.\n\nEach satellite in Block II carries atomic clocks8 (relative accuracy 10?13 to\n10?14) and of course computers, transmitter\u2013receivers, and all the necessary\nequipment. The nominal lifetime of the satellite is 10 years.\n\nWith a fundamental frequency f0 equal to\n\nf0 = 10.23MHz , (14.23)\n\nthe emitter generates two waves in the L band, denoted by L1 and L2, with\nfrequencies:\n\nL1 = 154f0 = 1,575.42MHz (wavelength 19.03 cm) ,\n\nL2 = 120f0 = 1,227.60MHz (wavelength 24.42 cm) .\n\n8The satellites of Block II and IIA are equipped with two cesium and two rubidium\nclocks, and the satellites of Block IIR with three rubidium clocks.\n\n\n\n668 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\nFor the satellites in Block IIF and following, a third frequency is emitted:\n\nL5 = 115f0 = 1,176.45MHz (wavelength 25.48 cm) .\n\nThe transmitted message, in addition to the time, provides the ephemeris of\nthe satellite, i.e., the Keplerian elements of the satellite and their derivatives\nas a function of time, together with auxiliary data.\n\nSeveral pseudo-random codes known as PRN (pseudo-random noise) are\ntransmitted. The two main codes are the coarse acquisition (C/A) code and\nthe precision (P) code. The C/A code is accessible to the general public,\nwhile the P code was originally reserved for authorised, i.e., military users,\nbut became available to all as of May 2000.\n\nThe Navstar/GPS satellites carry an order number n in the form GPS-n.\nHowever, the satellite is identified in the constellation by the PRN numbering\n(from 1 to 32 for Block II).\n\nOrbit\n\nAll the Navstar/GPS (Block II) satellites follow a near-circular MEO orbit,\ninclined at 55.0? (see Fig. 14.5). The satellites are recurrent with 1-day cycle\nand make exactly two revolutions in each sidereal day (see Table 14.1 and\n14.2, and Fig. 14.7). The altitude is 20,183km. We also have\n\na = 26,560.906 km , ? = 4.16437 , n = 1.4585\u00d7 10?4 rad s?1 .\n\nFor this kind of orbit the ratio of the perturbation due to J2 and the central\nacceleration is very small, because the altitude is high (see Fig. 6.1). In fact it\nis less than 10?4 (to be compared with 10?3 for an LEO orbit). The precession\nrates are, in degrees per day:\n\n\u2022 Nodal precession rate ?? = ?0.039.\n\u2022 Apsidal precession rate ?? = +0.022, since i is close to iC.\n\u2022 Variation of the mean motion ?n = ?4.4 \u00d7 10?4, since i is very close to\n\n54.7?, the inclination for which ?n is zero [see (6.75)].\n\nThe cycle relative to the Sun is CS = ?351.4 days for this orbit. Recall that,\nif ?? is zero, the cycle is equal to 1 year (CS = ?365.2 days). Twice a year, the\nsatellite suffers an eclipse (see Chap. 10 and in particular Fig. 10.26 upper).\n\nConstellation\n\nThe six planes of satellites, denoted by capital letters A, B, C, D, E, and\nF , are regularly spaced in a geocentric pseudo-Galilean frame, separated by\n60? of longitude to within a few degrees (see Fig. 14.6 lower and Example 14.1).\nIn any given plane, the four satellites are not regularly spaced (see Fig. 14.8).\n\nExample 14.1 Ground track of the orbits of two Navstar/GPS satellites fol-\nlowing one another in the same orbital plane.\n\n\n\n14.2 Navstar/GPS 669\n\nNavstar/GPS [PRN 05]\nOrbit (Celestial ref.)

GPS can be used dynamically (while in motion) or\nstatically (for a topographic network).\n\nIn geophysics, two GPS receiving stations are placed at two points on\nthe Earth a few thousand kilometers apart. With professional equipment,\nreception continues for months, and high performance statistical methods of\nsignal processing allow one to measure movements of the tectonic plates of the\norder of just a few millimeters a year (see the appendix in Sect. 14.10 at the\nend of this chapter). In this case, a precise ephemeris product is used: satellite\norbits are given to an accuracy of 5 cm and 0.1 ns. This data is supplied with\na 2 week delay.\n\n\n\n676 Chapter 14.

The\nlittle table included in the figure indicates the presence of the satellites every\nhalf-hour.\n\nFigure 14.10 (lower) shows the circle of visibility h = 10? for Paris (which\nis boat-shaped with the Mercator projection used here), together with the\norbital ground track of the satellite Navstar-2R-4 [PRN 20] over 2 h.

The other systems,\neither planned or under development merely reproduce the same idea.\n\nA complete positioning system involving dozens of satellites represents a\nhuge investment and requires a technologically advanced industrial base. After\nthe USA, Russia set up its system Glonass. Europe and China, with Galileo\nand Compass, respectively, will have their own independent systems, even\nthough several of these four systems will be perfectly compatible. We shall\nsee that other systems under way or planned, such as Japan\u2019s QZSS, will sup-\nplement the existing GPS system locally and cannot therefore be considered\nas global systems in their own right. China\u2019s Beidou-1 is a somewhat special\ncase, to which we shall return later on.\n\nThis profusion of systems, most still under development, has led to a prolif-\neration of terminology. Rather than GPS, the generic term Global Navigation\nSatellite System (GNSS) is now preferred to refer to these positioning sys-\ntems. However, as long as the American Navstar/GPS system is the only one\nto be widely used, we shall continue to speak of GPS rather than GNSS in\nthis context.\n\n14.3 Glonass\n\nGlonass, also written GLONASS or GloNaSS, is a Russian acronym\nfor Global\u2019naya Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema, meaning \u201cplanetary\nsystem\u2014global\u2014for satellite-assisted navigation\u201d. It was first developed by\nthe USSR from 1976, for military purposes. The first Uragan satellites were\nlaunched in 1982 and the system was declared operational on 24 September\n1993.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the positioning system was not\ninitially Russia\u2019s main concern, and Glonass no longer functioned correctly\ndue to a lack of satellites, with only six to eight satellites still working in\nthe constellation. But from 2003, the Russian government made Glonass a\npriority and several new generation satellites were placed in orbit, making it\nonce again operational.\n\n14.3.1 The Three Segments\n\nThe space segment10 is a constellation of 24 satellites (3 planes of 8 reg-\nularly spaced satellites). Each satellite is equipped with cesium clocks (sta-\nbility 10?13) and emits a signal with two frequencies which differ slightly\n\n10List of Glonass satellites:\n\n\u2022 The first 50 experimental then first generation satellites, from Uragan-1 (Kosmos-1413),\nlaunched on 12 October 1982, to Uragan-50 (Kosmos-2206), on 30 July 1992.\n\n\u2022 The 37 satellites of the Glonass series, from Glonass-773 (Uragan-51, Kosmos-2234),\nlaunched on 17 February 1993, to Glonass-798 (Uragan-87, Kosmos-2417), on 25 De-\ncember 2005.\n\n\n\n14.3 Glonass 679\n\nfrom one satellite to the next, centered around G1 = 1,609MHz and G2 =\n1,252MHz. The new generation Glonass-K satellites emit a third frequency,\nG3 = 1,205MHz.\n\nThe Glonass orbit is rather similar to that of Navstar/GPS (see Ta-\nble 14.1). It is a bit lower, at h = 19,130km, but with the higher inclination\ni = 64.8? giving better coverage of high latitudes. The recurrence is 17 revo-\nlutions in 8 days (compared with 16 revolutions in 8 days for Navstar), giving\na period of 11 h 16min (see Fig. 14.11).\n\nThe precession rates are very small, for the same reasons as for Navstar.\nIn degrees per day, they are\n\n?? = ?0.034 , ?? = ?0.004 , ?n = ?0.018 .\n\nThe geodetic reference system is the Russian one11 PZ-90.02 (Parametri\nZemli, also written PE-90, Parameter of Earth).\n\nThe control segment comprises around ten stations. The master station,\nKrasnoznamensk, is in the western suburbs of Moscow. At the present time,\nthere are about ten monitor states located throughout the territory of ex-\nUSSR, but mostly Russia. However, the Russian government is hoping to set\nup similar stations in Cuba, South America, and Australia. The accuracies\nobtained by Glonass alone are less good than those obtained by Navstar,\nbut the Russian authorities have promised to improve the system. The two\nsystems are compatible.\n\n14.3.2 Local View and Visibility Table\n\nWe select an arbitrary point P on the Earth and specify the visibility\nconditions for the satellites. A viewing elevation of at least 10? or 15? is\ngenerally imposed. For a given day, we record in a table all the time windows\nduring which P is seen by a given satellite. The calculation is repeated for\neach satellite in the constellation to obtain the visibility table.\n\nExample 14.3 Visibility table for all satellites in the Glonass constellation as\nviewed from Moscow on 1 March 2013. Likewise when viewing from the North\nPole and the Equator.\n\n\u2022 The satellites of the Glonass-M series, from Glonass-711 (Uragan-M1, Kosmos-2382),\nlaunched on 1 December 2001, then Glonass-736 to -738 (Uragan-M27 to -M29, Kosmos-\n2644 to -2466), launched on 2 September 2010.\n\n\u2022 The satellites of the new Glonass-K series, beginning with Glonass-K1-11 (Uragan-K1-1,\nKosmos-2471).\n\n11The Russian word zemli means \u201cthe Earth\u201d. It comes from the Indo-European root\n*ghyo?m, *ghemo?(n), of the same meaning, which also gives the Latin word humus, i, mean-\ning \u201cearth\u201d or \u201csoil\u201d. The Latin homo?, hominis comes from the same root. For example,\nthe French word \u201chomme\u201d literally means \u201cborn of the earth\u201d.\n\n\n\n680 Chapter 14.

For Moscow (56?N and 38?E), the visibility table is established for the\nwhole Glonass constellation on 1 March 2013, from 0 to 24h UT (see Fig. 14.12\nupper). The minimum viewing elevation is fixed at 15?.\n\nThe satellites are numbered from 1 to 24 (see Fig 14.8). Since they are\nregularly distributed in each plane, the overpasses are also perfectly regular,\nwith a time lapse of about 2 h from one satellite to the next. In the case shown\nhere, the point P is continually visible to five to seven satellites. Figure 14.12\n(lower) shows the ground track of a Glonass satellite over a recurrence cycle,\nwith visibility circle centered on the point P .\n\nVisibility tables are also established for h > 15? at a point at the North\nPole (see Fig. 14.13 upper) and at a point on the equator (see Fig. 14.13\nlower). ?\n\n14.4 Galileo\n\n14.4.1 A European Project\n\nIn contrast to the American, Russian, and Chinese systems, the European\nnavigation system remains entirely civilian. Galileo was finally chosen in 1999,\nafter much hesitation. Germany and Italy were much in favour, while the\nUnited Kingdom considered it an unnecessary expense, since the American\nGPS was already doing the same job, and it was free! At the time it was\nhoped that the system would be up and running by 2008.\n\nThe project is financed by the European Union (EU) and the European\nSpace Agency (ESA), itself financed by the member countries of the EU. The\nprogramme soon got behind schedule, in particular thanks to disagreements\nbetween Germany and Italy. Without going into the details, which would be\nmore appropriate in a book about political economy than a work on orbitog-\nraphy, let us say that the only clear consensus was for the name: Galileo. It\nstands as a fine tribute to a visionary and courageous thinker.\n\nAfter launching two test satellites,12 the Galileo system is gradually coming\ninto being, with four IOV (in-orbit validation) satellites13 in 2013, to begin\nthe constellation.\n\n12Launch dates: GIOVE-A on 28 December 2005 and GIOVE-B on 27 April 2008. These\nsatellites, placed on the Galileo orbit, serve to test the clocks and emitted signal, as well\nas occupying the frequency bands from an administrative point of view in the eyes of the\nrelevant international organisations. Originally named GSTB-v2A and -v2B (Galileo System\nTest Bed Version 2), they were renamed GIOVE (Galileo In-Orbit Validation Element).\nJupiter is Giove in Italian, and this is therefore an affectionate allusion to Galileo, who\ndiscovered the four largest moons of this planet.\n\n13Launch dates: Galileo-IOV-1 and -2 on 21 October 2011, Galileo-IOV-3 and -4 on 12\nOctober 2012.\n\n\n\n682 Chapter 14.

Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\n14.4.2 The Three Segments\n\nThe space segment comprises a constellation of 27 satellites (3 planes of 9\nregularly spaced). Each satellite is equipped with a rubidium clock (drift 5\u00d7\n10?13 s over 100 s), backed up by a hydrogen maser (drift 10?14 s over 3 h). The\nsignal comprises three frequencies: E1 = 1,575.420MHz, E6 = 1,278.750MHz,\nand E5 = 1,191.795MHz.\n\nThe Galileo orbit14 is 3,000km above the Navstar orbit, at h = 23,222km,\nwith almost the same inclination, at i = 56? (see Table 14.1). The recurrence\nis 17 revolutions in 10 days (20 revolutions in 10 days for Navstar), giving a\nperiod of 14 h 05min (see Fig. 14.14).\n\nThe precession rates are very low. In degrees per day,\n\n?? = ?0.026 , ?? = +0.013 , ?n = ?0.001 .\n\nThe geodetic reference system is the Galileo Terrestrial Reference Frame\n(GTRF), very close to WGS84, since the two systems are adjusted to the\nInternational TRF (ITRF).\n\nThe control segment comprises many stations around the globe, and this is\nwhere the French presence in La Re?union, Noume?a (New Caledonia), Papeete\n(French Polynesia), and Kourou (French Guiana) has proved extremely useful.\nThe two master stations are in Oberpfaffenhofen (in Bavaria, 20 km west of\nMunich) and Fucino (in the Abruzzi region of Italy, 130 km east of Rome).\n\nRegarding the user segment, two different regimes are planned. One is free,\nlike the GPS today, and the other paying. The accuracy promised for the free\nservice is quite outstanding, and one wonders what advantage there will be in\nthe paying service!\n\n14.5 BeiDou NS\n\nLike the three other navigation systems already discussed, the Chinese sys-\ntem15 BeiDou NS turns around a constellation of MEO satellites. They were\n\n14Originally, a recurrence cycle of five revolutions in 3 days was adopted. This corresponds\nto the orbit denoted by Galileo [0] in Table 14.1. But this orbit was abandoned because the\n5:3 recurrence creates resonance effects with the Earth\u2019s gravitational field. In addition, the\neffects of the Sun and Moon create major instabilities in the Galileo constellation.\n\n15Bei Dou is the Chinese name for the constellation Ursa Major, the Great Bear. In fact,\nin Chinese astronomy, there are 28 constellations, and they do not correspond exactly to\nthe constellations of Western astronomy, which features many more than this. Bei means\n\u201cnorth\u201d and Dou is an instrument for measuring grain that looks like a large scoop, just as\nthis constellation is sometimes referred to as the Saucepan or the Big Dipper, owing to its\nshape. Note that the Beidou satellites were also called Big Dipper at the beginning. The\nword \u201ccompass\u201d comes from the Old French (fourteenth century) compas, from the verb\ncompasser, meaning \u201cto measure out in strides\u201d. This in turn derives from the Latin verb\ncomposed of cum, \u201cwith\u201d, and passus, \u201cstride\u201d. The English noun took its present meaning\nin the fifteenth century. A single idea brings together the Great Bear, which provides an\n\n\n\n14.5 BeiDou NS 685\n\nGalileo\nOrbit - Ground track\n\nRecurrence = [ 2; -3; 10]  17\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:  10.00 days\n\nAltitude =23222.1 km a =29600.268 km\n\nInclination  =  56.00 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   844.69 min    * rev/day = 1.70\n\nEquat. orbital shift  =23573.5 km\n\nAsc.

In December 2012, it be-\ncame officially known as BeiDou NS or BeiDou Navigation Satellite System\n(BDNS; Fig. 14.15).\n\n14.5.1 The Three Segments\n\nThe MEO part of the space segment, BeiDou-M (with M for MEO),\ncomprises a constellation16 of 24 MEO satellites (3 planes of 8 regularly\nspaced satellites). Each satellite is equipped with a rubidium clock. The sig-\nnal is emitted at three frequencies: E2= 1,561.07MHz, E6=1,268.52MHz,\nand E5B=1,207.14MHz.\n\nThe orbit is very similar to that of Navstar/GPS, with altitude h =\n21,528km and inclination i = 56.3?. The recurrence cycle is 13 revolutions\nin 7 days (14 revolutions in 7 days for Navstar), whence a period of 12 h\n58min (see Fig. 14.16 upper). Precession rates are very small, for the same\nreason as for Navstar. The values are, in degrees per day,\n\n?? = ?0.031 , ?? = +0.015 , ?n = ?0.002 .\n\nThe MEO constellation is supplemented by two further systems17 (see Fig.\n14.16 lower):\n\n\u2022 BeiDou-G: five GEO satellites parked at longitudes 58.75?E, 80.0?, 110.5?,\n140.0?, and 160.0?.\n\n\u2022 BeiDou-I: three satellites on an inclined geosynchronous satellite orbit\n(IGSO). This is circular with inclination i = 55?. They are regularly spaced\non the same orbit with ascending node at longitude 118?E.\n\nThe geodetic reference system is CGS-2000 (China Geodetic System), almost\nidentical to ITRF. The control segment comprises one central station and\nthree monitoring stations. For the user, the accuracy is claimed to be on a\npar with Navstar.\n\neasy way to identify the Pole Star in Ursa Minor (the Little Bear), and the compass, an\ninstrument used for orientation. That was before the advent of GPS, of course!\n\n16Launch dates: Beidou-2-M1 (Compass-M1) on 13 April 2007, Beidou-2-M3 and -M4 on\n29 April 2012, Beidou-2-M2 and -M5 on 18 September 2012.\n\n17Launch dates for BeiDou-G (Compass-G): Beidou-2-G1 on 16 January 2010, Beidou-\n2-G2 on 14 April 2009, Beidou-2-G3 on 2 June 2010, Beidou-2-G4 on 31 October 2010,\nBeidou-2-G5 on 24 February 2012, Beidou-2-G6 on 25 October 2012.

These satellites Beidou-2-In are also denoted by Beidou-2-IGSO-n.\n\n\n\n688 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\n14.5.2 Beidou-1 Experimental System\n\nThe Beidou-1 positioning system, sometimes called the Beidou Navigation\nTest System (BNTS), is an experimental system. Also known as the Double\nStar Positioning System (DSPS), it uses two geostationary satellites and re-\nquires the user to possess a transmitter\u2013receiver. It has been running since\n2003.\n\nIt works in the following way. The control station emits a signal with a time\nsignature to the user P via two satellites S1 and S2, as shown schematically in\nFig. 14.17. When the user receives the first signal, from S1 say, he transmits\nit to C via the two satellites.\n\nThe control station can thus measure the two time intervals ?t1 and ?t2\ncorresponding to the two paths:\n\nC ? S1 ? P ? S1 ? C =? c?t1 = 2d1 + 2r1 ,\nC ? S1 ? P ? S2 ? C =? c?t2 = d1 + r1 + d2 + r2 ,\n\nwhere ri = ?SiP ? and di = ?SiC?, i = 1, 2. The two distances di are\nknown, as is the transponder response time, which we ignore in this simplified\ndiscussion. The required values are r1 and r2 :???\n\n??\nr1 =\n\nc\n\n2\n?t1 ? d1 ,\n\nr2 =\nc\n\n2\n(2?t2 ??t1)? d2 .\n\nThe required point is at the intersection of the two spheres ?i, centered on\nthe equatorial plane, with centers Si and radii ri. This intersection takes the\nform of a circle lying in a plane perpendicular to the equator. Then the in-\ntersection of ?1 ? ?2 with the Earth ellipsoid gives two points, one in the\nnorthern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere. The one in the\nnorthern hemisphere corresponds to the position of the Chinese user. A fur-\nther constraint is thus that the altitude of the point P must be known:\n\n\u2022 If P is on the ground, the control station C knows the altitude of P because\nit has a very accurate numerical terrain model (NTM) at its disposal for\nthe Chinese territory, with a graticule of one arcsec.\n\n\u2022 If P is in the air, the user must determine his altitude using a barometer,\nfor example, and send this information to C.\n\nOnce the position of P has been determined, the station C transmits the result\nto P . To the four journeys between the Earth and a geostationary satellite to\ndetermine the position, one must therefore add two others for the transmission\nof the result, making a total of 6, which takes 0.8 s in all.\n\n\n\n14.5 BeiDou NS 689\n\nBeiDou NS\nOrbit - Ground track\n\nRecurrence = [ 2; -1;  7]  13\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:   7.00 days\n\nAltitude =21527.6 km a =27905.750 km\n\nInclination  =  56.30 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   773.20 min    * rev/day = 1.86\n\nEquat. orbital shift  =21578.9 km\n\nAsc.

Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\nS2\n\nC\n\nS1\n\nP\n\nFig. 14.17 :The Beidou-1 sys-\n\ntem. A user P picks up a\n\nsignal emitted by the control\n\nstation C and transmits it to\n\nC via the two geostationary\n\nsatellites S1 and S2. The sig-\n\nnals are analysed by C, the\n\nposition of P is calculated,\n\nand the result is sent on to P .\n\nThe geodetic reference system18 for Beidou-1 is Beijing-1954. The space\nsegment19 consists of two geostationary satellites, Beidou-1A and -1B, parked\nat 80.0?E and 140.0?E. A backup satellite is parked at 110.5?E. The control\nsegment comprises the central station and three monitor stations, all in China.\n\nThe user segment consists of a somewhat bulky transmitter\u2013receiver. Cov-\nerage is rather limited:\n\nlatitude ? 55\n?N\n\n5?N , longitude\n70?E 140?E\n\n??\n\nAccuracy is around 100m. Using the third satellite in a differential method,\none could hope to achieve 20m. This accuracy is immediately lost when the\nreceiver is in movement. As soon as the speed exceeds a few meters per second,\nthe system becomes inaccurate, even unusable. The system also has limited\ncapacity: 540,000 users per hour, with a maximum of 150 users at any given\ntime.\n\nThe Beidou-1 positioning system has some advantages over Navstar/GPS:\n\n\u2022 It uses two satellites rather than a constellation of at least 24.\n\u2022 The clocks do not need to be ultra-precise. They need only be stable, since\n\nthey measure a time difference.\n\n18It is surprising to find that Beidou-1 uses such an antiquated reference system. And it\nis older than its name would suggest, since it is in fact a carbon copy of the Soviet model\nKrasovsky-1940.\n\n19Launch dates: Beidou-1A (BNTS-1A, DFH-51) on 30 October 2000, Beidou-1B (BNTS-\n1B, DFH-52) on 20 December 2000, Beidou-1C (BNTS-1C, DFH-56) on 24 May 2003.\n\n\n\n14.6 Augmentation Systems 691\n\nIt is thus a relatively cheap system that can be set up quite quickly. It also\nhas many disadvantages:\n\n\u2022 It only gives regional coverage, although this may be considered adequate\nby Chinese users.\n\n\u2022 Accuracy is rather limited, being only around 100m in standard mode.\n\u2022 The user terminal is bulky and expensive.\n\u2022 The number of users is limited.\n\nFor the Chinese authorities, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages since,\neven though they seemed to be satisfied with the Beidou-1 experimental\nsystem, they nevertheless decided to set up Beidou-2 (which become Compass,\nthen BDNS) along the lines of the Navstar system, i.e., using a constellation\nof MEO satellites.\n\n14.6 Augmentation Systems\n\nAs discussed above, differential GPS (DGPS) exploits the transmission to\nusers of the correction detected by the control station. Rather than sending\nthe information by terrestrial radio relay, it is transmitted directly to a geosta-\ntionary satellite which broadcasts it back to Earth. The extra satellite thus\nintroduced then provides an augmentation system. These systems, referred\nto as satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS), can lead to significant\nimprovements:\n\n\u2022 To begin with, by broadcasting corrections, they extend DGPS quality to\nmany more users.\n\n\u2022 Furthermore, they are equipped with GPS clocks and emit a type L1 signal\nspecified by its PRN code, which adds pseudo-range measurements to those\nobtained by the MEO satellites of the GPS constellation itself.\n\n\u2022 Finally, by analysing a whole set of data, these systems provide what is\nknown as an integrity service. Integrity is the guarantee that the signals can\nbe trusted, a necessary condition for GPS use by civil aviation authorities.\n\nThe regions covered by the various augmentation systems are shown in\nFig. 14.18 (upper) and a list of contributing satellites is given in Table 14.4:\n\n\u2022 The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) was developed by the avi-\nation authorities in the USA. It is based upon three or four GEO satellites.\nCoverage extends over the whole of North America, since the absorption\nof the Canadian CWAAS, and also Hawaii.\n\n\u2022 The American Wide Area GPS Enhancement (WAGE) system run by the\nUS Army (DoD) is only accessible to the military.\n\n\n\n692 Chapter 14.

It uses\ntwo tso satellites and the QZSS system (see below). The system is limited\nto Japan.\n\n\u2022 The Russian System for Differential Correction and Monitoring (SDCM)\nis based on three Luch satellites.\n\n\u2022 The planned Chinese system will be called Satellite Navigation Augmen-\ntation System (SNAS).\n\n20This is an acronym with a particularly successful double meaning, since gagan means\n\u201csky\u201d in Sanskrit.\n\n\n\n694 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\n14.7 Regional Systems\n\nHere we discuss two regional systems that are not equivalent: the Indian\nIRNSS is an autonomous system, while the Japanese QZSS serves only to\nimprove Navstar/GPS positioning in the major Japanese cities.\n\n14.7.1 IRNSS\n\nIndia will develop a navigation system based on GEO and GSO satel-\nlites, i.e., geostationary and geosynchronous with inclination. It will thus be\nregional, since there is no hope of global coverage without MEO satellites.\nThe India Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) is thus based on\nseven satellites, three of which are GEO and four GSO, all equipped with\nrubidium clocks emitting a signal at two frequencies: L5 = 1,176.45MHz and\nS = 2,492.08MHz. It will use the geodetic reference system WGS84.\n\nThe three GEO satellites are placed at separations of around 50? in lon-\ngitude, in fact, at parking longitudes 34.0?E, 83.0?E, and 131.5?E. The four\nGSO satellites are placed on two circular geosynchronous orbits with incli-\nnation i = 29?. The longitude of the ascending node is 55.0?E for one and\n111.0?E for the other (see Fig. 14.19 upper).\n\nThe expected accuracy is 20m over a main region lying between latitudes\n40?N and 40?S and longitudes 40?E and 140?E.\n\n14.7.2 QZSS\n\nThe Japanese space agency JAXA has come up with an interesting orbit,\nreminiscent of the Tundra orbit but less eccentric, and with a lower inclination\nthan the critical one.21 It is a geosynchronous orbit, with i = 40? and apogee\nover Tokyo. So not only does the satellite remain for longer over Japan, but\nit is almost vertically above the large Japanese cities, i.e., at the zenith (see\nFig. 14.20), whence the name Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS).\n\nThis constellation should contain three regularly spaced satellites QZS-1,\n-2, and -3. The first,22 QZS-1, is already operational. Its ground track is\nshown in Fig. 14.19 (lower). Each satellite remains visible for about 11 h a\nday, under the difficult visibility conditions imposed by h > 60?. Figure 14.21\ngives a good idea as to why the Navstar/GPS constellation is not particularly\neffective under such conditions, since there are rarely more than two or three\nof these satellites in view. The satellites of the QZSS constellation will supply\nthe fourth, or even the fifth satellite required for adequate positioning.\n\n21The apsidal precession rate is nevertheless very low, viz., ?? = ?0.01025?/day, or less\nthan 4? per year, which is easy to compensate.\n\n22Launch date: QZS-1 on 11 September 2010. QZS-1 also has the Japanese name\nMichibiki, meaning \u201cguide\u201d.\n\n\n\n14.7 Regional Systems 695\n\nIRNSS/GSO\nOrbit - Ground track\n\nRecurrence = [ 1; +0;  1]   1\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:  1440.0 min =   1.00 day\n\nAltitude =35787.3 km a =42165.410 km\n\nInclination  =  29.00 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =  1436.02 min    * rev/day = 1.00\n\nEquat. orbital shift  =40075.0 km\n\nAsc.

Credit:\n\nJAXA.\n\nThe reference geodetic system is the Japan Geodetic System (JGS), very\nclose to ITRF. The ground segment consists of the master control station\n(MCS) at Tsukuba, 60 km north of Tokyo, and nine monitor stations in Japan\nand overseas, the furthest being in Bangalore to the west, Hawaii to the east,\nand Canberra to the south.\n\n14.8 Non-positioning Uses of GPS\n\n14.8.1 Radio Occultation\n\nThe occultation of radio waves by the atmosphere was tested on the at-\nmosphere of Mars in 1965 by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) using the\nUS probe Mariner-4, and subsequently on the atmosphere of Venus in 1967\nusing Mariner-5. Then in 1994, the GPS signal was used to sound the Earth\u2019s\nown atmosphere, by placing a receiver on low-orbiting satellites.\n\nThe signal is emitted by the navigation satellite S and received by the\nLEO satellite L. The path SL (see Fig. 14.22) is a straight line when outside\nthe atmosphere, but is deflected when it crosses it. This deflection through\nan angle ? (several tenths of a degree) depends on the refractive index of the\nair, which is mainly a function of the local values of temperature, pressure,\ndensity, and water vapour content. In this way, one measures an integrated\nvalue over the whole path SL of length ab. Using an inversion technique such\nas Abel inversion, one can then deduce temperature profiles to an accuracy of\n0.1\u20130.5K, as well as profiles of pressure and other atmospheric parameters.\n\nSituations known as opposition, when the Earth passes between an LEO\nsatellite (?1 ? 14) and a GPS satellite (?2 = 2) occur roughly ?1 ? ?2 = 12\ntimes a day, and one can therefore expect 24 occultations. With 24 Navs-\ntar/GPS satellites, this means around 500 occultations per day, implying\n15,000 per month and per LEO satellite.\n\nThe first suitably equipped LEO satellites were the three geodesy satellites\nCHAMP and GRACE-A and -B, then \u00d8rsted, SAC-C, and MetOp-A and\n-B.

With such a constraint on\nvisibility, corresponding to the situation in the center of the large Japanese conur-\n\nbations, the Navstar/GPS constellation does not provide sufficient coverage. From\n\nthe table, we see that most of the time only two or three Navstar/GPS satellites are\n\nvisible, below the minimal threshold of four. The QZSS satellites (for the time being,\n\nonly QZS-1) will make a significant contribution here.\n\n-3A to -3F, is the first mission entirely dedicated to radio occultation (see\nFig. 14.23 upper). The planned European mission ACE+ (which takes up from\nthe WATS and ACE missions) is of the same type, with four LEO satellites,\ni ? 90?, equipped with GPS receivers. All these satellites are in near-polar\norbits. For better sampling of the tropical region, a receiver called Radio\nOccultation Sounder for the Atmosphere (ROSA) is carried aboard Megha-\nTropiques (see Figs. 14.23 lower and 14.24).\n\n\n\n698 Chapter 14.

But meteorological offices\nrecover these binned corrections, because they contain information about the\nintegrated water vapour content in the region of the troposphere traversed\nby the signal above the station at a given instant of time. This information\nis supplied continually and almost in real time, and can be assimilated with\nother physical data to set up weather forecasting models.\n\n14.8.3 Other Applications\n\nThe applications of GPS now extend beyond just positioning to some quite\nunexpected areas. Here is an example from the world of finance. At the present\ntime, many transactions on the stock exchange are decided by computers.\nAmong the latest services are the so-called flash orders, which allow certain\nclients (or rather, their computers) to consult orders on certain stocks a frac-\ntion of a second before their competitors. This microsecond insider trading\ncan be exposed by attaching a GPS \u201ctime marker\u201d during the transaction.\n\n14.9 Historical Note: The First Systems\n\n14.9.1 Transit\n\nThe Transit navigation programme began with a discovery by American\nresearchers at Johns Hopkins university (JHU/APL) in 1957: the orbit of\n\n\n\nFormoSat-3F/COSMIC\n0 km <->  75 km - Radio Occultation with Navstar/GPS\n\n>>>>   Time span shown:   7.00 days\n\nTotal number of occultations:     172\n\nTotal number of occultations:     170\n\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24LMT (local) hours\n\nAltitude =  791.7 km a = 7169.792 km\n\nInclination  =  72.02 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =   100.78 min    * rev/day =14.29\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 2828.2 km  (  25.4 \u00b0)\n\nAsc.

They then based their navigation\nprinciple on the opposite problem, i.e., if one knows the satellite position\nvery accurately, one can use the Doppler effect to deduce the position of the\nreceiver.\n\nThe US Navy, which was currently setting up the Polaris submarine missile\nlauncher programme, took up this idea and developed the first global position-\ning system under the name of US Navy Navigation Satellite System (NNSS)\nor Transit. After sending up several experimental satellites in the 1960s, the\nsystem became operational in 1964 with the so-called NSS 30 constellation.\n\n\n\n14.9 Historical Note: The First Systems 701\n\nThis comprised23 satellites in circular polar orbit at altitude 1,000km. The\nposition of the receiver was calculated from successive measurements of the\nDoppler\u2013Fizeau effect on the signal sent by the Transit satellite. This was only\npossible while the satellite was visible, i.e., at most 15min per revolution (see\nExample 13.5). With six satellites, the user could see a satellite every 100min\nat the equator, but every 35min at high latitudes.\n\nThe user had to know his altitude, not precisely determined by this\nmethod, and it was important that he should not be moving too quickly.\nUnder these conditions, position accuracy was 20m. For a stationary observer\nwith measurements over several days, accuracy could be brought down to 5m.\n\nThe Transit system began in 1964 for military use, but was opened to the\ngeneral public from 1967. Receivers cost around 1,000 US dollars and there\nwere up to 80,000 users, mainly involved in maritime activities. It was officially\nclosed down on 31 December 1996, after 32 years of service.\n\n14.9.2 The Soviet System\n\nThe USSR was a long way behind the USA in the field of positioning\nsystems. It was not until 1974 that they developed a system24 called Parus\nthat closely resembled Transit, then a civilian system called Tsikada, and\n\n23The Transit satellites fall into five categories:\n\n\u2022 The five experimental satellites, from Transit-1B, launched on 13 April 1960, to Transit-\n4A, launched on 29 June 1961, on similar orbits, with i = 66.7?, hp = 625 km, ha =\n1,080 km.\n\n\u2022 The ten prototype satellites in strictly polar orbit, from Transit-5A-1 on 18 December\n1962 to Transit-5C-1 (OPS/4412) on 4 June 1964, with i = 90.0?, h = 1,100 km. Transit-\n5B-1, launched on 28 September 1963, was the first satellite actually used by the US\nNavy.\n\n\u2022 The 24 operational satellites in the Oscar series (O for \u201coperational\u201d), from Transit-O-1\n(or NSS-30010, OPS/5798) on 6 October 1964 to Transit-O-25 (NSS-30250, NIMS-25,\nSOOS-4A) and Transit-O-31 (NSS-30310, NIMS-31, SOOS-4B), launched on 25 August\n1988. The satellite Transit-O-13 (NSS-30130,OPS/7218) operated from September 1967\nto January 1989.\n\n\u2022 The three Triad satellites of the Transit Improvement Program (TIP): Triad-1 (or TIP-\n1), launched on 2 September 1972, Triad-2 (TIP-2), on 11 October 1975, and Triad-3\n(TIP-3), on 1 September 1976, still on strictly polar orbits. These demonstrated the\nfeasibility of the drag-free technique.\n\n\u2022 The three Nova satellites, launched in this order: Nova-1 (NSS-30480) on 15 May 1981,\nNova-3 (NSS-30500) on 12 October 1984, and Nova-2 (NSS-30490) on 16 June 1988, all\non strictly polar orbits, with i = 90.0?, h = 1,180 km.\n\nEven after the end of the Transit programme, certain satellites of the Navy Ionospheric\nMonitoring System (NIMS) continued to operate, providing data on signal transmission\nthrough the ionosphere which could be used by the Navstar/GPS system.\n\n24The Soviet system can be divided into three families of satellites:\n\n\u2022 The 99 military satellites Parus (parus means \u201csail\u201d), or Tsikada-M (M for \u201cmilitary\u201d),\nfrom Parus-1 (Kosmos-700), launched on 26 December 1974, to Parus-99 (Kosmos 2463),\non 27 April 2010.\n\n\n\n702 Chapter 14.

Russia closed down\nthis operation in May 2007.\n\n14.10 Appendix: GPS and Tectonic Plates\n\nInside the Earth, the radioactivity of certain rocks produces heat by nu-\nclear decay. The upper regions of the mantle come up to the surface in a\nconvective phenomenon to form the Earth\u2019s crust. As it cools, this magma\nbecomes brittle and forms plates of thickness 10\u2013100km. The surface of the\nglobe is thus made up of a set of these very large plates. For example, the\nMORVEL model (2011) is based on a set of 25 plates.\n\nThe plates move relative to one another. This is known as plate tectonic\nmotion.25 When these plates rub up against each other, it produces continental\ndrift, which leads to earthquakes and volcanic activity.\n\n\u2022 Around 40 Tsikada satellites (this is the insect, the cicada), from Kosmos-883, launched\non 15 December 1976, to Kosmos-2315, on 5 July 1995, on slightly elliptical near-polar\norbits, i = 83?, hp = 960 km, ha = 1,020 km.\n\n\u2022 The 8 Nadezhda satellites (the word means \u201chope\u201d), from Kosmos-1383 on 29 June 1982,\nthen Nadezhda-1 on 4 July 1989 to Nadezhda-7 (Nadezhda-M-1) on 26 September 2002.\n\n25The word \u201ctectonic\u201d was coined in Germany in 1850 from the Greek tekton, ? ???????\n???\t, meaning \u201ccarpenter\u201d. This Indo-European root *tek, \u201cto produce\u201d, appears in the\nGreek techne?, ? ???? ?  \t, \u201chandicraft\u201d (giving \u201ctechnical\u201d) and the Latin textor, oris,\n\u201cweaver\u201d, textus, us, \u201ctissue\u201d, then \u201ctext\u201d. This root is also found textually in the scientific\nformatting software TEX , created by D. Knuth, and its successor LATEX.\n\n\n\n14.10 Appendix: GPS and Tectonic Plates 703\n\n4 cm/yr\n\nFig. 14.26 :Velocity field of horizontal displacements of the tectonic plates as pub-\n\nlished in the ITRF2008 definition document. Upper: Plane representation. The scale\n\nis indicated on the map. Lower: Orthographic representation centered on the Atlantic.\n\nThese values were obtained mainly from fixed GPS beacons. Document provided by\n\nthe authors: Zuheir Altamimi (LAREG/IGN), Xavier Collilieux (LAREG/IGN),\n\nLaurent Me?tivier (IPGP), Paris.\n\nIn 1915, the German geophysicist Alfred Wegener had already developed\nhis idea of continental drift on the basis of geographic, geological, and palaeon-\ntological considerations. Then from the 1970s, it became possible to corrobo-\nrate the theory of tectonic plates with the help of geophysical measurements\nexhibiting changes in the orientation of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field in the ocean\nfloor. It even became possible to estimate displacement rates.\n\nBut since 1992, these plate displacements have been measured directly\nusing GPS. The technique of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) and\nother techniques mentioned in Chap. 3 in the context of the ITRF, can be used\n\n\n\n704 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\nto obtain displacement rates to the same accuracy, but it is much simpler to\nset up a GPS beacon than a VLBI antenna.\n\nAt the present time, there are hundreds of GPS beacons distributed around\nthe globe (many of them in California, for detailed surveillance of the San\nAndreas fault, and in Japan). On 1 January 2011, there were 6,000 beacons\n(see Fig. 14.25). Their absolute position is measured in the most accurate GPS\nmode. The displacement of each beacon can then be ascertained in latitude\nand longitude, and in the vertical by suitable statistical processing. The result\nis a map showing the displacements of the tectonic plates, as exemplified in\nFig. 14.26.\n\nSatellites over 20,000km away can thus measure absolute displacements\nof a few millimeters per year at the surface of the Earth. This is surely one of\nthe most extraordinary scientific achievements of GPS.\n\n\n\n14.11 Appendix: GPS and Relativity 705\n\n14.11 Appendix: GPS and Relativity\n\n14.11.1 Presentation\n\nWritten in collaboration with Florent Deleflie.\n\nThe relevance of the relativity theories to GPS was exhaustively and au-\nthoritatively investigated by Ashby right from the beginning, when this nav-\nigation system was first conceived. In this appendix,26 we will not be adding\nanything fundamentally new to Ashby\u2019s work. Our aim is to make a didactic\npresentation of these relativistic corrections, to highlight the different orders\nof magnitude, and to demonstrate the effects or lack of effect of the latitude\non certain corrections. For the latter point, we shall refer to Chaps. 2, 3, and 6.\n\nThese relativistic corrections are determined by understanding the be-\nhaviour of the clocks held by the emitter and the receiver, since they con-\nstitute the very basis of this navigation system. The setting here is thus the\nspacetime of Einstein\u2019s theories of relativity.\n\n14.11.2 Proper Time Difference\n\nA clock is a device for counting the periods of some repetitive phenomenon.\nThe time scale associated with the clock is a measure of the extent to which\nthe repetitive phenomenon has progressed (one tick of the clock corresponds\nto each instant on the time scale), allowing one to define a unit of time such as\nthe second. A proper time interval is measured by counting a certain number\nof periods in the frame in which the clock is at rest. In a frame in which the\nclock is moving, this same number of periods defines a time interval called\nimproper time.\n\nOne part of the proper time difference results from the difference of speeds\nof the satellite and the receiver, and the other part comes from the difference in\ngravitational potential between the satellite and the receiver. The first effect,\ndue to the speed difference, thus relates to the special theory of relativity (SR),\nwhile the second, due to the geopotential, is a term specifically predicted by\nthe general theory of relativity (GR). The latitude of the receiver is relevant\nto both, due to the fact that the Earth is rotating and the fact that it is not\nspherical. We shall show that, when the two effects are added together, the\nlatitude is no longer relevant.\n\nSpecial Relativity and Time Dilation\n\nIn the context of special relativity, Einstein\u2019s theory (Fig. 14.27) stipulates\nthat the speed of light c is the same in every frame. This implies that two\nframes with relative speed V have time scales related by the Lorentz factor:\n\n26We wish to thank Pierre Sagnou, Stephen Lyle, and Richard Kerner for helpful\ndiscussions.\n\n\n\n706 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\nFig. 14.27 :Albert Einstein.\n\n?timproper =\n1?\n\n1? (V/c)2\n?tproper . (14.24)\n\nLet ?t? be the interval of time of 1 s for a body moving with velocity V\nrelative to an Earth-centered inertial (ECI) frame ?, as defined in Chap. 3,\ni.e., the time interval between two ticks of the moving clock. The time interval\nof 1 s for the stationary body in ? is denoted by ?t, i.e., the time interval\nbetween two ticks of the stationary clock. The Lorentz factor relates these two\nquantities. Expanding to first order the expression in (14.24), we have\n\n?t? ?\n(\n1 +\n\nV 2\n\n2c2\n\n)\n?t . (14.25)\n\nNote that ?t? > ?t, implying that a moving clock always runs more slowly\nthan a clock at rest.\n\nThe relative time variation ?SRi for a body i, moving at speed Vi, is given\nin special relativity by\n\n?SRi =\n?t? ??t\n\n?t\n=\n\nV 2i\n2c2\n\n. (14.26)\n\n(1) Satellite (SR). Consider a satellite moving at velocity V relative to\nan inertial frame ?. Insofar as its orbital motion around the Earth can be\ntreated as uniform (GPS satellite orbits are near-circular), the magnitude of\nits velocity will be constant and (14.24), which involves V 2, can be applied.\nWe first consider the case where the orbit with semi-major axis is circular. In\nthis case, (4.52) implies\n\n?SRsat =\n?\n\nc2\n1\n\n2a\n. (14.27)\n\n(2) Earth (SR). The receiver clock is carried along by the Earth\u2019s rotation\nand is also in motion relative to ?. We consider a clock at arbitrary geocentric\nlatitude ?, stationary relative to the Earth. As in Chap. 3, ? denotes the\nangular speed of the Earth\u2019s rotation. For an Earth treated as an ellipsoid of\n\n\n\n14.11 Appendix: GPS and Relativity 707\n\nrevolution, with equatorial radius R, the dependence of the Earth radius R?\non ? is given by (1.37). With the approximation given by (1.39), the speed\nV?(?) of a point of latitude ? at the Earth\u2019s surface can be written\n\nV?(?) = R?? cos? ? R?(1? f sin2 ?) cos? ,\n\nand the relative variation due to the Earth\u2019s rotation with respect to ? is thus\n\n?SR? =\nV 2?\n2c2\n\n? ?\n2Rc2\n\nma cos\n2 ?(1 ? 2f sin2 ?) ,\n\nusing the dimensionless quantity ma defined by (3.34). Since the quantities\nma and f are very small, the product maf can be neglected in a first order\ncalculation, and the last formula simplifies to\n\n?SR? ?\n?\n\n2Rc2\nma cos\n\n2 ? . (14.28)\n\n(3) Satellite/Earth (SR). To compare the clock aboard the satellite with\nthe clock \u201caboard\u201d the Earth, we write down the relative difference ?SR, viz.,\n\n?SR =\n?t?sat ??t??\n\n?t\n\n???\nSR\n\n=\n?t? ??t\n\n?t\n\n???SR\nsat\n\n? ?t\n? ??t\n?t\n\n???SR\n?\n\n.\n\nThe total effect due to time dilation is therefore the difference between the\ntwo values found previously:\n\n?SR = ?SRsat ??SR? , (14.29)\n\nwhich gives in the present case\n\n?SR =\n?\n\n2R c2\n\n(\nR\n\na\n?ma cos2 ?\n\n)\n. (14.30)\n\nThis correction is always positive: the second for the satellite is always longer\nthan the second for the receiver. This is a classic example of time dilation.\n\nGeneral Relativity and Gravitational Blueshift\n\nWe now consider the effects due to the gravitational potential as predicted\nby Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. The relation between proper and\nimproper time is given by the Schwarzschild metric:\n\n?timproper =\n1?\n\n1? (2U/c2)\n?tproper , (14.31)\n\nwhere U is the gravitational potential. Expanding (14.31) to first order, we\nobtain\n\n?t? ?\n(\n1 +\n\nU\n\nc2\n\n)\n?t . (14.32)\n\n\n\n708 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\nNote that ?t? > ?t, implying that a clock runs all the more slowly as the\ngravitational potential increases.\n\nThe relative time variation ?GRi for a body i, subject to a gravitational\npotential Ui, is given in general relativity by\n\n?GRi =\n?t? ??t\n\n?t\n=\n\nUi\nc2\n\n. (14.33)\n\n(1) Satellite (GR). For the satellite in circular orbit of radius a, the\npotential is\n\nU =\n?\n\na\n,\n\nwhence ?GRsat is given by\n\n?GRsat =\n?\n\nc2\n1\n\na\n. (14.34)\n\n(2) Earth (GR). For a point at the geocentric latitude ? on the Earth\u2019s\nsurface, assumed ellipsoidal again, the potential is given by (3.27) as\n\nU?(?) =\n?\n\nR?\n\n[\n1? J2\n\n(\nR\n\nR?\n\n)2\n3 sin2 ? ? 1\n\n2\n\n]\n.\n\nNote that, in an inertial frame ?, the surface of the ellipsoid (or geoid) is not\nan equipotential surface since the potential U?(?) depends on ?.\n\nExpressing R? and neglecting terms in J2f , we deduce that\n\nU?(?) =\n?\n\nR\n\n[\n1 +\n\n1\n\n2\nJ2\n(\n1? 3 sin2 ?\n\n)\n+ f sin2 ?\n\n]\n,\n\nand we thus obtain\n\n?GR? =\n?\n\nRc2\n\n[\n1 +\n\n1\n\n2\nJ2 + sin\n\n2 ?\n\n(\nf ? 3\n\n2\nJ2\n\n)]\n. (14.35)\n\n(3) Satellite/Earth (GR).

(14.36)\n\nThis is known as the Einstein effect or gravitational blueshift.27\n\n27One also speaks of gravitational redshift, which simply reflects a change of perspective,\nswapping the emitter and the receiver.\n\n\n\n14.11 Appendix: GPS and Relativity 709\n\nSum of the Two Effects: Net Secular Effect\n\nWe now add together the two contributions, denoting the total by ?1 :\n\n?1 = ?\nSR +?GR ,\n\nwhereupon we obtain\n\n?1 =\n?\n\nRc2\n\n[\n3\n\n2\n\nR\n\na\n? 1\n\n2\nma cos\n\n2 ? ? 1? 1\n2\nJ2 ? sin2 ?\n\n(\nf ? 3\n\n2\nJ2\n\n)]\n\n=\n?\n\nRc2\n\n[\n3\n\n2\n\nR\n\na\n? 1? ma + J2\n\n2\n? sin2 ?\n\n(\nf ? 3J2 +ma\n\n2\n\n)]\n. (14.37)\n\nWe now apply Clairaut\u2019s first relation (3.33), viz.,\n\nJ2 =\n2\n\n3\nf ? 1\n\n3\nma ,\n\nwhence it transpires that the term in sin2 ? in (14.37) cancels out. This means\nthat the sum of the two relativistic corrections is in fact independent of the\nlatitude of the receiver. Equation (14.37) can then be written\n\n?1 =\n?\n\nRc2\n\n(\n3\n\n2\n\nR\n\na\n? 1? J2 +ma\n\n2\n\n)\n. (14.38)\n\nThis quantity is referred to in the literature as the net secular effect.\nIt is interesting to express ?1 in two parts: ?sat concerning the satellite\n\nand ?? concerning the Earth. Equation (14.38) becomes\n\n?1 = ?sat ??? , (14.39)\n\nwith\n\n?sat = ?\nSR\nsat +?\n\nGR\nsat =\n\n3\n\n2\n\n?\n\nac2\n, (14.40)\n\n?? = ?SR? +?\nGR\n? =\n\n?\n\nRc2\n\n(\n1 +\n\nJ2 +ma\n2\n\n)\n. (14.41)\n\nIn order to go further, expanding the potential to a higher degree, the calcu-\nlations would become much more complex because other coefficients charac-\nterising the topography would have to be included to take into account the\nfact that the shape of the Earth is no longer treated as an ellipsoid of revo-\nlution, and this would make the expression for the centrifugal potential much\nmore complex. This would nevertheless lead to a similar form for the results,\nalthough of course incorporating further coefficients such as J4, Jn, and so on,\ngiven that the surface of the rotating Earth remains an equipotential surface.\nWe conclude that, on the geoid, the total relativistic correction is independent\nof the latitude.\n\n\n\n710 Chapter 14.

(14.43)\n\nIf we add the contribution from geopotential terms28 up to J10 (the contribu-\ntion from J4 to J10 is 6.391\u00d7 10?16), it has the value\n\n??(J10) = 6.969289401\u00d7 10?10 , (14.44)\n\nand up to J24,\n\n??(J24) = 6.969290044\u00d7 10?10 . (14.45)\n\nThis should be compared with\n\nLG = 6.969290134\u00d7 10?10 , (14.46)\n\nwhich is the value recommended by the International Astronomical Union\n(IAU) when calculating the terrestrial time (TT) scale,29 as explained in\n\n28Setting ? = 0 in the expansion of the geopotential [see (3.45)], we obtain\n\nU? =\n?\n\nR\n\n[\n1?\n(\n?1\n2\nJ2 +\n\n3\n\n8\nJ4 ?\n\n5\n\n16\nJ6 +\n\n35\n\n128\nJ8 ?\n\n63\n\n256\nJ10\n\n)]\n.\n\n29The coordinated time in the geocentric spacetime system (TCG,Temps coordonne?e\nge?ocentrique) differs from terrestrial time (TT) by a secular term:\n\nTCG?

Apply-\ning (14.39), we obtain the factor ?1 which characterises the relative time\ndifference, with the numerical values given by (14.42) and (14.45) or (14.46):\n\n?1 = +2.5046\u00d7 10?10 ? 6.9693\u00d7 10?10 = ?4.4647\u00d7 10?10 .

(14.48)\n\nThis difference of 38.574 ?s per day in the propagation time of the signal\ncorresponds to a distance of\n\n?? = c\u00d7 ?t1 = 11.6 km per day .

(14.50)\n\n30Neil Ashby tells the following story:\n\nAt the time of launch of the NTS-2 GPS-precursor satellite (23 June 1977), which\ncontained the first cesium atomic clock to be placed in orbit, there were some who\ndoubted that relativistic effects were real effects that had to be accounted for. A fre-\nquency synthesizer was built into the satellite clock system so that after launch, if\nin fact the rate of a clock in its final orbit were predicted by general relativity, then\nthe synthesizer could be turned on, bringing the clock to the coordinate rate neces-\nsary for operation. After one of the cesium atomic clocks was turned on in NTS-2,\nit was operated for about 20 days to measure its clock rate before turning on the\nsynthesizer. The frequency measured during that period was +442.4 parts in 1012\n\ncompared to the ground, while relativity theory predicted +446.47 parts in 1012. The\ndiscrepancy was only about four parts in 1012, well within the accuracy capabilities\nof the orbiting clock.\n\nThe orbit of NTS-2 was described in section \u201cMain Dates\u201d.\n\n\n\n712 Chapter 14.

(14.51)\n\nCorrections for GPS\n\nThe overall relativistic effect referred to as the net secular effect corre-\nsponds to a relative clock variation whose value, given by (14.38), is calculated\n\n\n\n14.11 Appendix: GPS and Relativity 713\n\nusing (14.47) or (14.51) for Navstar/GPS. The Navstar/GPS documentation\nindicates a correction\n\n?GPS1 = ?4.464733\u00d7 10?10 .\n\nThis correction is made directly by the satellite, by modifying the nominal\nfrequency emitted by its clock. While the basic frequency of the GPS signal\nis given as [see (14.23)]\n\nf0 = 10.23MHz ,\n\nthe frequency f em0 actually emitted is\n\nf em0 = 10.23\u00d7 (1 +?GPS1 )\n= 10.23\u00d7 (1? 4.464733\u00d7 10?10)\n= 10.2299999954326MHz . (14.52)\n\nWith this value, the signal received on Earth by the receiver has the same\nfrequency as if the satellite clock were situated on the geoid.\n\n14.11.3 Effect Due to Orbital Eccentricity\n\nThe main idea here is to study the effects of variations in speed induced by\nthe eccentricity e of the orbit, which is typically of the order of 10?3 for GNSS\nsatellites. This implies a change in the speed and the potential in the previous\nequations, replacing a by r. We thus consider the value of ?1 as given by\n(14.38), depending on whether e is zero (denoted by ?2c for a circular orbit,\nand corresponding exactly to ?1) or not (denoted by ?2e for an eccentric\norbit). The difference between ?2e and ?2c then measures the effect on the\nrelative time difference due to e. With (4.39), we obtain\n\n?2 =\n?t? ??t\n\n?t\n\n????\necc\n\n= ?2e ??2c =\n2?\n\nc2\n\n(\n1\n\nr\n? 1\n\na\n\n)\n. (14.53)\n\nWe see that ?2 varies over an orbital period from a minimal value at the\napogee to a maximal value at the perigee, depending on the value of r.\n\nUsing the eccentric anomaly E defined in (4.64), we find that (14.53)\nbecomes\n\n?2 = 2\n?\n\nc2\n1\n\na\n\ne cosE\n\n1? e cosE . (14.54)\n\nThis relative difference will show up during one revolution as a gain or loss\nof time, with extrema at the apogee and perigee. Appealing to (4.79), which\nrelatesE andM , we integrate (14.54) with respect to time to obtain a quantity\nwith units of time:\n\n\n\n714 Chapter 14. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)\n\n?tecc(t) =\n2?\n\nc2a\n\n?\ne cosE\n\n1? e cosE (1 ? e cosE)\n\n?\na3\n\n?\ndE\n\n= 2\n\n?\n?a\n\nc2\ne sinE . (14.55)\n\nThe integration constant is set to zero (it can be included in the clock offsets,\nwhich disappear after applying the Kalman filter). During one revolution,\nthe time difference will therefore vary between the extreme values of ?tecc,\ndenoted by ??tmax2 and +?tmax2 , where\n\n?tmax2 = 2\n?\n?a\n\nc2\ne . (14.56)\n\nWith (4.68), we note that (14.55) can be written in the form\n\n?tecc(t) =\n2rr?\n\nc2\n. (14.57)\n\nNumerical Application\n\nFor Navstar/GPS, we obtain\n\n?tmax2 = 2.2897\u00d7 10?6e . (14.58)\n\nIf we take 10?3 as a realistic value for the eccentricity,31 for a GNSS satellite,\nwe find\n\n?tmax2 = 2.29 ns .\n\nThis is very small compared with the previous effects. It corresponds to a\nmaximal positioning error broadcast by the satellite of the order of a few\nmeters (depending on the exact value of e) (see Table 14.6).\n\nCorrections for GPS\n\nThis second effect, due to the geometry of the ellipse (residual periodic\neffect) is of the order of a few nanoseconds, but varies during a revolution\nin a way that depends on the orbital elements a, e, E of the satellite. The\ncorrection is transmitted by each satellite (e differing from one satellite to\nanother). The correction is applied by the receiver.\n\n31Ever since N. Ashby took e = 0.02 as an example, which gives ?t = 46ns, all documents\ntreating this question have reproduced this result of 46 ns. We note that the eccentricity e\nnever reaches such a value for navigation satellites placed in orbit since the historic period\nof the first Navstar/GPS satellite launches.\n\n\n\n14.11 Appendix: GPS and Relativity 715\n\nUnits Navstar/GPS Glonass Galileo BeiDou NS\n\na km 26,560.9 25,507.6 29,600.3 27,905.8\ne \u2013 ? 0.0060 ? 0.0005 ? 0.0005 ? 0.0005\nV km/s 3.873891 3.953066 3.669620 3.779393\nT min 717.978 675.735 844.685 773.200\nR/a \u2013 0.2401326 0.2500485 0.2154754 0.2285595\n\n?sat 10\n?10 2.50464 2.60806 2.24746 2.38393\n\n?? 10?10 6.96929 6.96929 6.96929 6.96929\n?1 10\n\n?10 ?4.46465 ?4.36123 ?4.72183 ?4.58536\n?? km 11.6 11.3 12.3 11.9\n?t1 ns ?38,574.6 ?37,681.0 ?40,796.6 ?39,617.4\n?tmax2 ns 13.7 1.1 1.2 1.2\n?tmax3 ns 133.4 127.8 149.6 140.6\n\nTable 14.6 :Comparison of relativistic effects for the four types of navigation satellite\n\n(GNSS). a semi-major axis of the orbit, e eccentricity, V average speed of satellite,\n\nT nodal (draconitic) period, R equatorial radius. ?i relative value of the difference\n\nbetween the proper time (in the ECI frame \n) and improper time. ?sat is the value\nof ?i for the satellite (relative to \n), defined by (14.40), and ?? is the value of\n?i for the Earth (relative to \n), the same for all satellites, defined by (14.41) and\ncalculated using (14.45), defined by the IAU by (14.46) or (6.147). ?1 = ?sat ???,\ndefined by (14.38) and calculated using (14.47). ?? maximal daily error, distance de-\nfined by (14.49). ?t1 daily proper\u2013improper time difference, defined by (14.48). ?tmax2\nmaximal proper\u2013improper time difference, defined by (14.56) for each revolution of\n\nthe satellite, relating to the orbital geometry and calculated here for the eccentric-\n\nity indicated in the row for e. ?tmax3 absolute value of the maximal proper\u2013improper\ntime difference for each revolution of the satellite, due to the Sagnac effect and de-\n\nfined by (14.64). Units are given in the first column.

Consider a receiver located at a point A of the Earth\nat time t1, the instant of emission of the signal by the satellite S. The signal\nreaches the receiver at some time t2, when it is located at a different point\nA? of the inertial frame ? (A ?= A?), as shown in Fig. 14.28. During the time\nlapse t2 ? t1, the receiver has been displaced through AA?.\n\nA geometric approach can be used to calculate the time difference due to\nthe Sagnac effect:\n\n?t\n??Sagnac = SA\u00b7 (?ez ?OA)\n\nc2\n, (14.59)\n\n\n\n716 Chapter 14.

The point A has\n\nmoved to A? in an inertial\nframe during the time taken\n\nfor the signal to be transmit-\n\nted from S to A.\n\nwhere ?ez is the angular velocity of the Earth\u2019s rotation. We note that the\nSagnac effect is zero if the satellite is in the meridian of the point A, with AA?\n\npointing to the east. Its sign depends on the relative direction of the satellite\nas viewed from the receiver. It is positive before entering the meridian plane\ncontaining the satellite (hence to the west), then negative.\n\nEquation (14.59) is then written in the form\n\n?t\n??Sagnac = 2?\n\nc2\nez\u00b7T , (14.60)\n\nwhere\n\nT =\n1\n\n2\nOA ? SA ,\n\nwith T the directional area of the triangle SOA.\nFor the Earth, we define the quantity S? by\n\nS? = 2\n?\n\nc2\n= 1.62271\u00d7 10?21 sm?2 = 1.62271\u00d7 10?6 ns km?2 , (14.61)\n\nand then\n\n?t\n??Sagnac = S?ez\u00b7T . (14.62)\n\nThe Sagnac effect is given by the scalar product of the vector S?ez along the\npolar axis and the vector T normal to the surface (directional area), which\ndelivers the projected area of this triangle in the equatorial plane multiplied\nby the coefficient S?.\n\n\n\n14.11 Appendix: GPS and Relativity 717\n\nThe maximal value ?tmax3 of the Sagnac effect can be evaluated. It corre-\nsponds to the maximal possible area of the projection of the triangle SOA.\nThis situation arises when S lies in the equatorial plane of the Earth and A\nappears at the limb for S. The triangle SOA is than right-angled at A, with\na = OS and R = OA, whence\n\nTmax = ?T?max =\n1\n\n2\nR\n?\na2 ?R2 ,\n\nand\n\n?tmax3 = S? \u00d7 Tmax . (14.63)\n\nNumerical Application\n\nFor a Navstar/GPS satellite, Tmax = 8.221 \u00d7 107 km2, which gives the\nmaximal value of the Sagnac effect as\n\n?tmax3 = 1.62271\u00d7 10?6 \u00d7 8.221\u00d7 107 = 133.4 ns . (14.64)\n\nSee Table 14.6.\n\nCorrections for GPS\n\nThis third effect is due to the geometry of the Earth\u2013satellite configuration.\nThe correction is therefore necessarily applied by the receiver.\n\n14.11.5 Conclusion\n\nRelativistic effects can be classified into three categories:\n\n\u2022 Time Dilation. A transported clock, in this case on the satellite, runs\nmore slowly than one at rest on the Earth, in this case, the receiver clock.\nThis effect is solely a function of the satellite velocity.\n\n\u2022 Blueshift Effect. The transported clock runs faster than the one on the\nEarth. This effect is solely a function of the satellite altitude.\n\n\u2022 Sagnac Effect. The transported clock runs more slowly or faster than\nthe one on the Earth. This effect depends on the relative position of the\nsatellite and the terrestrial meridian of the receiver.\n\nSeveral other effects are mentioned in the literature as relevant in the orbits\nof artificial satellites, including geodesic precession, the Lense\u2013Thirring effect,\nand the Schwarzschild correction. The Shapiro effect is another phenomenon\naffecting the transmission of the signal. Taken together, all these effects modify\nthe propagation time by a few picoseconds per day.\n\n\n\nChapter 15\n\nSatellites of Mars\n\n15.1 Presenting the Planet Mars\n\n15.1.1 Mars and Space Exploration\n\nIf we compare the Earth with its two neighbours, it has something in\ncommon with Venus on the next orbit in toward the Sun, and that is its size.\nHowever, it is with the next planet out, moving away from the Sun, that the\nEarth has most affinity, because two fundamental parameters, namely, the\nlength of day and the obliquity, have very similar values for these two planets.\n\nLike the Earth, Mars exhibits climatic phenomena, with winter and sum-\nmer, sandstorms, and permanent ice at the poles. These seasonal phenomena\nhave long been observed by astronomers, as can be seen from the drawings by\nHuygens in 1672. The atmosphere of Mars (to which we shall return shortly)\nis in fact rather transparent in the visible, while this is not at all the case for\nVenus.1 The fact that Mars is further away from the Sun, about 1.5 astro-\nnomical units further away than the Earth, means that it is much colder (the\ngreenhouse effect due to the atmosphere is much less pronounced), and the\nyear is almost twice as long.\n\nThe planet has been observed since ancient times. It doubtless owes its\nassociation with the god of war to its red colour: Ares for the Greeks2\n\n(? ?????, ???, giving the prefix areo- for attributes pertaining to this planet),\nand Mars for the Romans. Later, telescopic observation revealed some detail\non its surface and it was suggested that Martians had been digging canals.\n\n1On Venus, with a very dense atmosphere and extreme greenhouse effect, temperatures\nare always very high, both day and night, whatever the season or the latitude. The atmo-\nsphere is moving, always in the same direction, following the rotation of the planet in a\nmotion known as super-rotation. The winds are very strong at high altitudes, but much less\nso near the surface.\n\n2Ares literally means \u201cwarrior, male\u201d, from the Indo-European root ?ar, meaning \u201cto\ntake, destroy, cause something to perish\u201d.\n\nM.

Satellites of Mars\n\nIn the twentieth century, more precise telescopic observations were improved\nstill further by data from probes at the beginning of the space age.\n\nSpace Exploration: The USSR and Russia\n\nIn October 1960, the USSR attempted to send two probes (sometimes\ncalled Marsnik-1 and -2), just 3 years after the first Sputnik, to overfly Mars.\nHowever, they exploded at launch. (In fact it is not clear whether there were\none or two probes.) All 14 subsequent probes failed, either at launch or later\nby loss of contact: Sputnik-29, Mars-1 (which was the first probe to approach\nMars, but silent) and Sputnik-31 in 1962, Zond-2 and -3 in 1965, two probes\nwithout clearly attributed names (Mars-1969-A and -B) in 1969, Kosmos-419,\nMars-2 and -3 in 1971, Mars-4, -5, -6, and -7 in 1973. Note that Mars-2 crashed,\nbut it was the first manmade object to touch Mars, while Mars-3 and Mars-6\nseem to have soft-landed, but contact was lost after a few seconds. Attempts\nresumed 15 years later, with Phobos-1 and -2, launched in July 1988. The\nmission was to observe the moon Phobos from an orbit around Mars. The\nprobe Phobos-2 came very close to Phobos, then stopped transmitting. The\nUSSR clocked up 17.5 failures out of 18 attempts!\n\nMars was a forbidden planet for the Soviets and it remained so for the\nRussians. The mission Mars-96 ended in the Pacific on 16 November 1996,\nthe day of its launch. The same happened in 2011 with the very ambitious\nmission Phobos-Grunt. The probe was supposed to go into a near-circular\nequatorial orbit around Mars, thereby approaching Phobos on its orbit, land\non it (hence the mission name grunt, which means \u201cground\u201d in Russian),\nmake observations, take samples, and finally return to Earth! The departure\nwas planned for November 2011, with the return to Earth in 2014. But un-\nfortunately, launched on 8 November 2011, the probe remained blocked in\nEarth orbit and ended up like its predecessor in the Pacific. So Russia\u2019s Mars\nexploration has seen two failures in two attempts!\n\nSpace Exploration: The USA\n\nThe United States launched Mariner-3 and -4 in November 1964. The\nfirst probe was lost, but Mariner-4 overflew Mars and sent back the first\nphotographs (21 in all) on 14 July 1965. Launched in February and March\n1969, the probes Mariner-6 and -7 overflew the Red Planet and provided a\ngreat many photographs. And launched in May 1971 (like Mariner-8, lost at\nlaunch), the probe Mariner-9 was the first to go into orbit around the planet\n(hp = 1,650km, ha = 17,100km, T ? 12 h) on 14 November 1971. Up until\n27 October 1972, it sent back 7,329 photographs which completely changed\nour understanding of Mars.\n\nThe two probes Viking-1 and -2, launched in August and September 1975,\nalso successfully accomplished their missions (see Fig. 15.1 upper left). For\neach probe, there was an orbiter and a lander. The landers transmitted data\nconcerning the Martian atmosphere and surface over several Martian years.\n\n\n\n15.1 Presenting the Planet Mars 721\n\nThe next probe, 17 years after Viking, was the first not to be sent in\ntandem. This was Mars Observer, launched on 25 September 1992, lost as it\nwas being placed in orbit around Mars.\n\nThe probe known as Mars Global Surveyor (MGS), launched on 7 Novem-\nber 1996, took with it many of the instruments designed for the previous\nmission. It went into orbit around Mars after a 10 month journey to reach its\ndestination at 14 light-minutes from the Earth (Mars orbit insertion MOI).\nThe orbit of MGS was made circular by aerobraking (or air braking).3 It was\nalso the first Sun-synchronous Martian orbit. The instrument MOLA provided\na very accurate topographical study of Mars whose results will be used here.\nThe camera MOC took photographs with a resolution of a few meters on the\nground (see Fig. 15.1 lower left).\n\nLaunched on 4 December 1996, the probe Mars Pathfinder made an op-\nportune soft-landing on 4 July 1997 and released the microrover Sojourner,\nwhich subsequently investigated the immediate vicinity of the landing site.\n\nThe orbiter and lander of the Mars Surveyor-98 programme both failed.\nConcerning the orbiter, the probe Mars Climate Orbiter, launched on 11 De-\ncember 1998, was lost due to an erroneous correction to its trajectory on 23\nSeptember 1999, as it approached Mars. As for the lander, Mars Polar Lander\n(MPL), launched on 3 January 1999, it went silent on 3 December 1999, just\nas it arrived on Mars. Contact was lost with the probe and the two Deep\nSpace-2 penetrators.\n\nThe probe Mars Odyssey was launched on 7 April 2001 and reached Mars\non 24 October. The orbit was made circular by aerobraking and became Sun-\nsynchronous and operational on 30 January 2002. Mars Odyssey (2001, a space\nodyssey to Mars!) mapped the distribution of chemical elements and minerals\non the Martian surface. It revealed the presence of large amounts of water ice\njust a few centimeters beneath the surface in regions of high latitude (above\n55?N and 55?S, see Figs. 15.14 and 15.16).\n\nThe two American probes known as Mars Exploration Rovers, MER-A\nand -B, which left on 10 June and 8 July 2003, arrived on 4 and 25 Jan-\nuary 2004, dropping the two rovers Spirit and Opportunity, each weighing in\n\n3The probe, whose motion is mainly governed by the planetary attraction, goes into a\nhighly eccentric orbit with one focus at the center of the planet. To obtain a circular orbit,\none uses the drag of the planetary atmosphere on the spacecraft. The satellite loses energy,\nmainly at the periastron, since this is where it moves most quickly and there is the most\natmosphere. The apoastron is thus reduced upon each revolution. This maneuver is known\nas aerobraking. It has the disadvantage of being very slow. In fact it takes several months.\nHowever, it is very economical in terms of energy. Since it does not require use of retro\nrockets, there is no need to carry propellant. And it is well known that it costs a great deal\nof propellant to take on extra propellant.\n\nThis technique was used for the three US missions in Sun-synchronous orbit: MGS\nover 850 revolutions (and hence as many periastron passages), Mars Odyssey over 300\nrevolutions, and MRO over 425 revolutions. The first experiments with aerobraking were\nmade by Magellan around Venus, at the end of its mission in 1993, with a view to testing\nthe technique (see Chap. 16).\n\n\n\n722 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\n\n\n15.1 Presenting the Planet Mars 723\n\nFig. 15.1 :The images on these two pages show the improving accuracy of pictures\n\nof Mars. Upper left: The volcano Olympus Mons.

Lower left: Crater of diameter 2.3 km in the Schiaparelli\n\nBasin. With the light coming from the left, the central layer seems to lie above\n\nthe others. The crater may have been filled with water in the remote Martian past.\n\nHowever, another hypothesis is that these layers may have formed from deposits of\n\nsand carried by the wind, as in a stratified dune. Image taken on 3 June 2003 by the\n\ncamera MOC aboard the MGS. Credit: Malin Space Science Systems (MOC), MGS,\n\nJPL/NASA. Upper right: Sand cascades. These are not rows of poplar trees planted\n\nin the Sahara! In the spring, near the Martian North Pole, the Sun\u2019s rays sublime\n\na thin layer of carbon dioxide snow (CO2) which covers the dunes. These rays pass\n\nthrough the transparent ice and heat it from the base. The carbon dioxide ice then\n\nsublimes, producing geysers which drag up the underlying black sand. When it falls\n\nback onto the surrounding ice, the relatively hot sand grains on the carbon dioxide\n\nice are as though in levitation in a phenomenon known as calefaction. They tumble\n\ndown the slightest slope in a cascade, leaving parallel dark tracks behind them. This\n\nimage was photographed using the HiRISE camera aboard MRO (25 cm/pixel, field\n\ncovered 1 km) in April 2008. Credit: HiRISE, MRO, LPL (University of Arizona),\n\nNASA.\n\n\n\n724 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\nat around 180kg. Designed to operate for a few months, both vehicles sig-\nnificantly exceeded expectations, exploring plains, craters, and hills. Spirit\nceased to function on 30 March 2008 after having travelled 7 km, while Op-\nportunity, successfully avoiding damaging intake of sand from the dunes and\nother pitfalls, has gone on to cover a distance of 37 km in 9 years. In 2013,\nOpportunity is exploring the flanks of the great crater Endeavour with its\ndiameter of 22 km, and will continue its route southward.\n\nThe probe Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) was launched on 12 Au-\ngust 2005 and arrived on 11 March 2006. Its orbit was circularised by aero-\nbraking and took its definitive Sun-synchronous, near-circular form with h ?\n300km. The camera HiRISE took extremely accurate photos [see Figs. 15.1\n(upper right) and 15.33]. The mission brought much to our understanding of\nthe role played by water in Mars\u2019 past, not to mention the climate in general.\n\nIn 2007, the mission known as Phoenix saw part of the MPL and MSP\u201901\nmissions rise from the ashes. Launched on 4 August 2007, the probe landed in\nthe high northern latitudes of the planet, on 25 May 2008, placing a lander at\na latitude of 68?N. Phoenix arrived at the end of spring (solar longitude LS =\n76?, explained below) and operated until 2 November 2008 (LS = 151?), before\nthe end of the northern Martian summer. Phoenix confirmed the presence of\nwater ice in the Martian ground at this location, using its mechanical arm\nequipped with a spade to uncover the ice beneath a few centimeters of sand.\nIn 2010, the probe MRO formed an image of the Phoenix site. It was observed\nthat the station, which had spent several months under the carbon dioxide\nice, had lost a solar panel and was covered with dust.\n\nThe mission known as Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) includes a rover,\ndevoted to geology and climatology. Launched on 26 November 2011, the\nprobe arrived on Mars on 6 August 2012 and deployed4 the rover with great\naccuracy (2 km error in distance and 1 s in time) at the chosen site.5 This six-\nwheeled exploration vehicle called Curiosity has the size of a small car and a\nmass of 890kg. It runs on a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (4.8 kg of\nplutonium dioxide, PuO2, enriched with plutonium 238) which should ensure\na lifetime of at least one Martian year, and probably much longer.6 After a\nyear of operation, the scientific results have already been spectacular.\n\n4The method selected for the final descent through the atmosphere and release of the\nrover was new and highly technical (some said, very acrobatic and risky), using a retro\nrocket and parachute for the last part of the maneuver.\n\n5Of 30 sites proposed in 2006, only 4 were shortlisted. Then in July 2011, Gale Crater\nwas finally selected, at an altitude of ?4.5 km. The images provided by MRO were used to\nspecify the exact landing site.\n\n6The solar energy available on Mars was judged inadequate for this experiment. In\nfact, the solar constant on Earth is CEarth0 = 1,367Wm\n\n?2 (outside the atmosphere). If\naS = 1.524 a.u. is the semi-major axis of the Mars orbit, we find that the solar constant on\nMars (outside the atmosphere) is\n\nCMars0 = C\nEarth\n0 a\n\n?2\nS = 592Wm\n\n?2 .\n\n\n\n15.1 Presenting the Planet Mars 725\n\nThe Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission is dedi-\ncated to the study of the upper Martian atmosphere and its interaction with\nthe solar wind, to understand how Mars may have lost most of its primordial\natmosphere. Launch is expected between 18 November and 7 December 2013,\nwith orbit insertion on 16 September 2014. The final orbit, inclined at 75?\n\nand elliptical with e = 0.46, will have a low periastron at hp = 150 km, with\nfive deep-dip overpasses planned at 125km.\n\nSpace Exploration: Europe and Other Nations\n\nEurope has had only one mission, but it has been an enormous success.\nThe ESA probe Mars Express, launched on 2 June 2003, went into orbit on 25\nDecember.7 The seven instruments aboard have perfectly fulfilled their many\nmissions of accurate photography and studies of minerals, the atmosphere,\nand the interaction of the solar wind with the planet (see Fig. 15.20). Ten\nyears on, Mars Express is still sending back data.\n\nConcerning the ExoMars-TGO programme, the ESA and NASA had\nplanned to join forces. In fact, ExoMars had been envisaged by the ESA\nand the Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) by NASA. However, NASA withdrew from\nthe project after committing itself to the programme. At the present time,\nthe ESA project is being carried out in collaboration with the Russian space\nagency Roskosmos. In 2016, the TGO probe will drop a 600kg lander before\ngoing into orbit, and in 2018, the ESA rover Exomars should be soft-landed\nusing a system that has been largely developed by the Russian team.\n\nFor the TGO, launch is planned for January 2016, with orbital insertion\non 19 October 2016. The orbit will be circularised by aerobraking, with h =\n400km, i = 74?. The choice of inclination results from a compromise: high\nenough to be able to view the poles, but low enough to allow rapid local time\nsampling,8 thanks to a high nodal precession rate (see Example 15.2).\n\nJapan hoped to place its probe Nozomi (hope) in orbit, but failed.9 In\nNovember 2013, India will launch the probe Mangalyaan (Mangala is the name\nfor the planet Mars in Sanskrit, and yaan means \u201cvessel\u201d). This should go\ninto a highly eccentric orbit around Mars, with hp = 372 km, ha = 80,000km.\n\nTaking into account the eccentricity e = 0.0934 of the orbit, the Martian value of the\n\nconstant lies between a minimum at aphelion of CMars0\n[\naS(1 + e)\n\n]?2\nand a maximum at\n\nperihelion of CMars0\n[\naS(1? e)\n\n]?2\n, implying a variation between 495 and 720Wm?2.\n\n7Unfortunately, the lander Beagle-2 remained silent. The name Beagle given to this\nground laboratory can be understood from the note on Darwin.\n\n8This increases the occurrences of sunrise and sunset, and by observing these, the at-\nmospheric composition can be sounded in some detail.\n\n9Launched on 3 July 1998, the Planet-B probe (Nozomi) was supposed to reach Mars on\n11 October 1999, with the help of a Moon\u2013Earth\u2013Moon gravity assist maneuver. However,\nthis maneuver was not perfectly successful and the probe went into a heliocentric orbit.\nThere was still a chance that it could reach Mars in January 2004, 4 years behind schedule,\nbut this too was a failure.\n\n\n\n726 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\nLaunch Dates\n\nThese missions are launched at intervals of slightly more than 2 years\n(26 months). Naturally, the trip from Earth to Mars is undertaken when the\nconditions required for the journey are as short as possible, and the most eco-\nnomical in terms of fuel. This happens when the two planets are in opposition,\ni.e., when the Sun, Earth, and Mars are aligned, in that order. The time inter-\nval between oppositions corresponds to the synodic period. With the values of\nthe periods given in Table 15.1, T = 1 for the Earth and T1 = 1.88 for Mars\n(unit: Earth sidereal year), the synodic period T ? is obtained from (8.44):\n\n1\n\nT ?\n=\n\n1\n\n1\n? 1\n\n1.88\n=\n\n0.88\n\n1.88\n=? T ? = 1.88\n\n0.88\n= 2.135 ,\n\nand hence,\n\nT ? = 2.135 yr = 780 d ? 2 yr 2 m . (15.1)\n\nAn approximate value is sufficient here, since the orbits of Earth and Mars are\nnot exactly concentric. We calculate more precisely that the interval between\ntwo oppositions varies from 764 days (oppositions close to the aphelion of\nMars) to 810 days (oppositions close to the perihelion of Mars) owing to the\neccentricity of the orbit.\n\n15.1.2 Geography of Mars\n\nTopography\n\nWhen discussing the Earth, we have shown maps of our beautiful planet\nwithout specific indications. However, the geographical features of Mars are\nmuch less familiar to the great majority of Earthlings. And what might those\nfeatures be in any case? On Mars, there is no division into land and sea, but\ndifferent regions do appear with differing degrees of lightness and darkness\nthrough the telescope, depending on the albedo of the given terrain. The maps\npresented here are topographical charts bearing no relation to the albedo. The\noutlines are thus contours of constant altitude, plotted from data obtained by\nthe MOLA instrument aboard MGS, and processed by the MOLA/NASA\nScience Team.\n\nAs on Earth, the zero meridian is chosen arbitrarily. It passes through the\nsmall crater10 Airy-0, in homage to the \u201ccreator\u201d of the Greenwich meridian.11\n\n10In his 1877 map of Mars, the Italian astronomer Schiaparelli measured longitudes from a\nmeridian passing through a region which he considered characteristic and easily identifiable,\ncalled Sinus Meridiani by Camille Flammarion. When Mariner-9 mapped Mars in 1972,\nwith a resolution of 1 km, a more precisely defined point had to be chosen in this region.\nThe choice of this small impact crater was made by the Mariner-9 Team. It is 500m across\nand located in the crater Airy. The coordinates of Airy-0 are 5.2?S, 0.0?E.\n\n11George Biddell Airy (1801\u20131892) was a British astronomer who studied diffraction rings\nfrom the standpoint of astronomy, physics, and mathematics.

Today, it is defined as the gravitational equipotential surface whose\nmean value at the equator is equal to the mean radius determined by MOLA,\nwhich implies an elevation of 2 km above the old zero level.\n\nRoyal Observatory at Greenwich, from 1835 to 1881, he considerably increased the impor-\ntance of the institution when he established the meridian by means of a transit telescope\nin 1850 and persuaded the whole country to adopt the local mean solar time at Greenwich\n(GMT). In 1884, the Greenwich meridian was recognised internationally.\n\n\n\n728 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\nThe topographic map in Figs. 15.2 and 15.3 shows a very clear difference\nof altitude between the northern and southern hemispheres. The huge impact\nbasin Hellas12 in the southern hemisphere is the site of the lowest point on\nMars, some 7,825m below the zero level. Near the equator, Olympus Mons\n(21,183m) is the highest mountain in the Solar System13 (see Fig. 15.1 upper\nleft). To the south-east of Olympus Mons is the Tharsis region, known as the\nTharsis Bulge, with its alignment of three volcanoes (14\u201318km high), and a\nlittle further east is the great scar of Valles Marineris.14 The poles are covered\nby the ice caps.15\n\nGeologically, the southern hemisphere, above the mean land level, is cov-\nered with large craters and composed of ancient landscapes, while the north-\nern hemisphere, several kilometers below the mean land level, features wide\nplains under a layer of lava. In the equatorial region, the Tharsis Bulge is a\nvast plateau at high altitude.\n\nThe caption to Fig. 15.2 indicates the locations of successful Mars missions.\nThey are situated in low-altitude regions which provide sufficient atmospheric\nthickness to allow for aerobraking with parachutes.\n\nNote on Latitudes\n\nHere on Earth, the historical determination of the latitude using the local\nvertical led us to distinguish geographical and geocentric latitude. On Mars,\nthe precise determination of the latitude dates back only to the space age, and\nin principle we consider only the latitude determined by satellites, which is the\ngeocentric, or perhaps we should say planetocentric or areocentric latitude.\n\n12At the end of the nineteenth century, names were attributed on the basis of an Earthly\ndesign. Certain dark areas seemed to evoke the shape of the Mediterranean, whereupon\nGreece or the Gulf of Syrtis were placed there. Naturally, north and south were swapped,\nan artefact of telescopic vision! The astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli may be considered as\nthe father of the current Martian nomenclature, thanks to intensive observations he carried\nout from 1877. He borrowed names from ancient history and classical mythology. The\nInternational Astronomical Union (IAU) unified the various appellations. They comprise\ntwo Latin nouns, a generic noun such as mons for \u201cmount\u201d, and a proper noun such as\nOlympus. This gives names like Olympus Mons, Mare Tyrrhenum, and Hellas Planitia.\nValles Marineris is the valley discovered by Mariner-9.\n\n13This volcano has a circular base with diameter 650 km. It has a very distinct caldera,\n40 km wide and 4 km deep. There is a difference of height of 23 km, since its base is at an\naltitude of about ?2,000m. It is now inactive, like all Martian volcanoes, but the small\nnumber of impacts on its surface indicate that it was active in the geologically recent past.\nThe volume of Olympus Mons is about a hundred times greater than the biggest terrestrial\nvolcano. Eruptions of fluid lava have created an enormous volcanic shield over very long\ngeological periods. This volcano, like the three others of the Tharsis region, has remained\nin the same position with respect to the source of the magma. This great stability tends to\nprove that tectonic activity is low or non-existent on Mars.\n\n14The Mariner valleys constitute a system of several parallel canyons, about 5,000 km\nlong. The greatest of them is 6 km deep over a width of about 200 km.\n\n15The two poles are covered by a polar deposit of radius several hundred kilometers. These\nare undoubtedly made up of sediments and water ice. The whole thing is then covered over\nwith a permanent cap of water ice in the case of the North Pole and frozen carbon dioxide\n(CO2) at the South Pole. On top of this, a carbon dioxide ice layer condenses seasonally,\nin the Martian winter, to sublime in summer.\n\n\n\n15.1 Presenting the Planet Mars 729\n\nVk1\n\nVk2\n\nPat\n\nSpi\n\nOpp\n\nPhx\n\nCur\n\nVk1\n\nVk2\n\nPat\n\nSpi\n\nOpp Cur\n\nFig. 15.2 :Topographical chart of the planet Mars, compiled from data gathered by the\n\nMOLA instrument aboard MGS (processed by the MOLA/NASA Science Team).\n\nContours: steps of 2.5 km.

To\nthe north of this region is Alba Patera (42?N, 252?E). The main impact basins are\nHellas (45?S, 70?E), Argyre (50?S, 320?E), Isidis (12?N, 88?E), and Utopia (45?N,\n110?E).

Credit: MOLA/NASA Science Team.\n\nHowever, in the (magnificent) maps of Mars drawn up by the US Geolog-\nical Survey (USGS), there is a choice between two different grids, depending\non whether one is using areocentric (planetocentric) latitudes or areographic\n(planetographic) latitudes. The difference between the two is maximal for\n45? N or S, where it is equal to ?? = 0.337?, which corresponds to 20.0 km on\nthe ground [see (2.4) and (2.5)]. In this chapter, we shall use only areocentric\nlatitudes for Mars.\n\nMartian Atmosphere\n\nThe space missions brought us our first real insight into the atmosphere of\nMars, first with the radio occultations of Mariner-4 and Mariner-9, then with\nthe landers Viking-1 and -2.\n\nThe main components of the atmosphere are, in mole fractions: car-\nbon dioxide CO2 (0.95), dinitrogen N2 (0.03), argon A (0.02), water H2O\n\n\n\n15.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities 731\n\n(< 0.0005). The average pressure at the surface is 6 hPa. Due to the con-\ndensation of carbon dioxide gas at the polar caps, the atmospheric pressure\nvaries by up to 30% with the seasons. There are thus seasons on Mars, and\nan atmospheric circulation similar to the circulation on Earth (generally with\none large Hadley cell). There are also depressions and anticyclones, hurricanes\nand tornadoes, and the atmosphere is full of dust. Storms are frequent and in\nsome cases global, enveloping the whole planet in an orange veil.\n\nThe Mars missions have greatly refined our scientific understanding and\nhave been used to develop general circulation models (MGCM for NASA,\nGCM for the LMD in Europe). Conversely, by improving these models, future\nmissions can be better prepared, especially those making use of aerobraking.\n\n15.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities\n\n15.2.1 Geodetic Data\n\nTo study the true (perturbed) motion of a satellite, geodetic characteristics\nof the planet must be brought into consideration, in particular, higher terms in\nthe expansion of the attractive potential. To characterise specific orbits, e.g.,\nstationary or Sun-synchronous, and study instrument sampling, astronomical\nfeatures such as the periods of planetary motions, eccentricity, and obliquity\nare required.\n\nTable 15.1 provides geodetic16 and astronomical data for Mars, comparing\nthem with the same data for the Earth. Table 15.2 shows how the evaluation\nof the gravitational constant ? has evolved, from the first estimated values\nobtained following the discovery of Phobos and Deimos to the Goddard Mar-\ntian Model (GMM) which makes use of MGS observations. The latest models\nare GMM-3, also called MGM1025 (degree 80 and order 80), see Table 15.3,\nand JGM85F01, also called MGS85F (degree 85 and order 85).17\n\n16When Mars replaces the Earth as attractive center, we sometimes use the prefix \u201careo\u201d\ninstead of \u201cgeo\u201d, but certain terms such as \u201cgeophysics\u201d, \u201cgeodesy\u201d, and \u201cgeography\u201d are\ngenerally retained for all planets. There are exceptions, however.\n\n17The Mars Global Surveyor Gravity Science Team at JPL under the direction of William\nL. Sjogren provides details which give a good idea of the methods used to set up geopotential\nmodels. MGS85F is a 85 \u00d7 85 spherical harmonic model derived from radio tracking of:\nMariner 9 (1971-11-14 to 1972-04-14), Viking Orbiter 1 (1976-06-21 to 1978-11-18), Viking\nOrbiter 2 (1977-03-02 to 1978-07-25), MGS Science Phasing Orbit 1 and 2 (SPO1 and SPO2)\n(1998-03-28 to 1998-09-23), MGS Gravity Calibration Orbit (GCO) (1999-02-02 to 1999-\n03-29), MGS Mapping (MAP) (1999-03-29 to 2001-08-14). The radio tracking data blocks\nconsist of: Mariner 9 with 47,597 observations; Viking Orbiter 1 with 67,545 observations;\nViking Orbiter 2 with 70,677 observations; SPO1 and SPO2 at 177 km periapsis with 134,072\nobservations; GCO at 370 km periapsis with 145,777 observations; MAP at 370 km periapsis\nwith 2,102,977 observations.\n\n\n\n732 Chapter 15.

For example, the angular speed of Mars\nin its orbit around the Sun and in its rotation about the polar axis will be\ndenoted by ??S and ??T, respectively. In place of (7.21) and (7.26), we obtain\n\n??S = 0.5240384\n?d?1 , (15.2)\n\n??T = 350.89198266\n?d?1 .

As the mean day\non Earth lasts 1 day, it is better to find another name for the Martian day.\nThe mean solar day on Mars is traditionally called a sol. We then have\n\nDM = 1 sol = 1.02749127 day\n\n= 24h 37m 22.663 s . (15.4)\n\nIt is useful to express the tropical year in sols, since it concerns the recurrence\nof the seasons and also the sidereal year:\n\nNtro = 668.5921 sol , Nsid = 668.5991 sol . (15.5)\n\n15.2.3 Areocentric Longitude and Martian Day\n\nTrue Anomaly and Mean Anomaly\n\nTo determine a given day on Mars, i.e., specify the position of the planet\non its heliocentric orbit, we do not use the day of the month, and even less\nso a saint on the calendar, as on Earth. We consider the ecliptic longitude l,\ndefined in ecliptic coordinates in Chap. 7. It only differs from the true anomaly\n\n\n\n734 Chapter 15.

The origin for l is the vernal equinox18 and for Mars it\nis traditional to denote this angle l by LS. It is called the areocentric solar\nlongitude, or areocentric longitude for short.\n\nHence, on Mars, the \u201cdate\u201d LS is specified by the true anomaly with the\nspring equinox as origin, whereas on Earth, it is specified by the mean anomaly\nwith 1 January as origin. The true anomaly v has its origin at the perihelion\n(periastron). The solar longitude of the perihelion LSp is\n\nLSp = 251.0\n? . (15.6)\n\nThe mean anomalyM also has its origin at the perihelion, and we shall denote\nit by MS when the origin is at the vernal equinox. Its value at the perihelion\n\n18The orbit of Mars is itself subject to a precession of the equinoxes. This motion is\nslower than it is for the Earth, being 7??.51 per Earth year, or one round trip in 173 kyr\n(kilo year). For Mars, only the Sun contributes to this precession, whereas on Earth, not\nonly is the Sun\u2019s effect greater, but one must add the even more significant contribution due\nto the Moon, as we have already seen. The perihelion is also subject to apsidal precessional\nmotion in a prograde direction. The combination of the two motions specifies the climatic\nprecession, which has a cycle of about 55 kyr. There is a fundamental difference between the\ntheory of paleoclimates on the Earth and on Mars. In the case of the Earth, the inclination\nremains in a narrow range (obliquity between 22? and 25?), while it varies significantly and\nchaotically on Mars, between 0? and 60? (between 15? and 45? over the last 10 million\nyears).\n\n\n\n15.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities 735\n\nis then denoted by MSp. We have the relations\n\nv = LS ? LSp , (15.7)\nM = MS ?MSp . (15.8)\n\nRecall that the mean anomaly M is obtained from the true anomaly v\nanalytically, but that the converse problem of obtaining the true anomaly\nv from the mean anomaly M requires us to solve the Kepler problem:\n\nv ??? M : M = M(v) by (4.59) ,\nM ??? v : v = v(E) , E = E(M) by iteration (4.85) .\n\nTo calculate MSp, we first determine the true anomaly v? at the vernal\nequinox, noting that this is not of course the same point ? as for the spring\nequinox on Earth:\n\nv? = LS? ? LSp = 0? LSp = 360? 251.0 = 109.0 [mod 360] , (15.9)\n\nwhere LS? is the areocentric longitude of the vernal equinox, which is zero by\ndefinition of LS.\n\nFrom (4.59), we obtain the mean anomaly M? of the vernal equinox ana-\nlytically:\n\nM? = M(v?) = M(109.00) = 98.66 [mod 360] . (15.10)\n\nThen, changing origin, we determine MSp from\n\nMSp = MS? ?M(v?) = 0?M(v?) = 360? 98.66 = 261.34 [mod 360] ,\n(15.11)\n\nwhereMS? is the value ofMS at the vernal equinox, which is zero by definition\nof MS.\n\nConversely, starting with MSp = 98.66\n?, we obtain v = 109.00? by solving\n\nthe Kepler problem (see Example 4.4).\nTo be more precise, note that the perihelion has a slow precessional mo-\n\ntion relative to the vernal equinox. This is called climatic precession [see in\nparticular (6.142)], with a cycle of around 55 kyr (where 1 kyr = 1,000 year).\nThe longitude LS of the perihelion thus varies slightly over time. If A is the\nyear number in the Gregorian calendar, then LSp is given in degrees by\n\nLSp = 250.999 + 0.00645(A? 2000) . (15.12)\n\nCalculating MSp, we find\n\nMSp = 261.342 + 0.00677(A? 2000) . (15.13)\n\nFor example, for the year 2014, LSp = 251.09\n? and MSp = 261.44?.\n\n\n\n736 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\nRelation Between Longitude and Day\n\nDay Obtained from the Areocentric Longitude. The day D (zero at\nthe vernal equinox) is obtained from the mean anomaly by\n\nD =\nNtro\n360\n\nMS . (15.14)\n\nWe obtain the day in days (Dd) or in sols (Ds) depending on whether Ntro is\nexpressed in days or in sols. In the following, we will give the Martian days\nin sols. Using the relations between angles discussed above and the relation\n(4.59), we obtain Ds from LS by\n\nDs = Dsp +\nNtro\n360\n\n[\n2 arctan\n\n(?\n1? e\n1 + e\n\ntan\nLS ?

(15.16)\n\nThe values of the angles and days19 are given in Table 15.4 and Fig. 15.6.\nThe table also shows the reduced distance r/a, the distance to the Sun\n\ndivided by the semi-major axis of the orbit, and the eccentric anomaly E,\nwhich are related by (4.64), together with the quantity\n\nECS = LS ?MS , (15.17)\n\ncomparable with the equation of center EC = v ? M , defined in Chap. 4 by\n(4.90). The two angular differences ECS and EC only differ by a constant: ECS\nvanishes at the vernal equinox and EC at the perihelion.\n\nThe extreme values of ECS are:\n\n\u2022 maximum ECS = +0.35? for LS = 94.01 + LSp = 344.99?,\n\u2022 minimum ECS = ?21.05? for LS = 259.99 + LSp ? 360 = 156.97?.\n\nThe amplitude of the variation is (21.05 + 0.35)/2 = 10.70?. According to\n(4.98), this value, expressed in radians as (?/180)10.70 = 0.1868, corresponds\nto twice the eccentricity e = 0.0934 of the orbit of Mars.\n\nAreocentric Longitude Obtained from the Day. Knowing the day Ds,\nwe can calculate the difference with the day of passage at perigee. This differ-\nence Ds ?Dsp gives the difference in mean anomaly MS ?MSp. By iteration\n\n19Concerning the calculation of Ds using (15.15), the object in square brackets must be\nexpressed in degrees, since it multiplies Ntro/360. Note also that, since LS = 0 implies\nDs = 0, the value of Dsp can be found from (15.15) without using (15.16).\n\n\n\nLS MS ECS Dd Ds v E M r/a\n\n(deg) (deg) (deg) (day) (sol) (deg) (deg) (deg)\n\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 109.0 103.9 98.7 1.0224\n10.0 10.7 ?0.7 20.4 19.8 119.0 114.2 109.3 1.0383\n20.0 21.7 ?1.7 41.3 40.2 129.0 124.7 120.3 1.0532\n30.0 32.9 ?2.9 62.9 61.2 139.0 135.4 131.6 1.0665\n40.0 44.5 ?4.5 84.9 82.6 149.0 146.1 143.2 1.0776\n50.0 56.2 ?6.2 107.3 104.5 159.0 157.0 154.9 1.0860\n60.0 68.2 ?8.2 130.1 126.6 169.0 167.9 166.8 1.0913\n70.0 80.1 ?10.1 152.9 148.8 179.0 178.9 178.8 1.0934\n80.0 92.1 ?12.1 175.8 171.1 189.0 189.9 190.8 1.0920\n\n90.0 104.1 ?14.1 198.6 193.3 199.0 200.8 202.8 1.0873\n100.0 115.9 ?15.9 221.1 215.2 209.0 211.7 214.5 1.0794\n110.0 127.5 ?17.5 243.2 236.7 219.0 222.5 226.1 1.0688\n120.0 138.8 ?18.8 264.9 257.8 229.0 233.2 237.5 1.0560\n130.0 149.8 ?19.8 285.9 278.3 239.0 243.7 248.5 1.0413\n140.0 160.6 ?20.6 306.4 298.2 249.0 254.1 259.3 1.0256\n150.0 171.0 ?21.0 326.3 317.5 259.0 264.3 269.7 1.0092\n160.0 181.0 ?21.0 345.5 336.2 269.0 274.4 279.7 0.9929\n170.0 190.8 ?20.8 364.1 354.3 279.0 284.3 289.5 0.9770\n\n180.0 200.2 ?20.2 382.1 371.8 289.0 294.0 298.9 0.9620\n190.0 209.4 ?19.4 399.6 388.9 299.0 303.6 308.1 0.9483\n200.0 218.3 ?18.3 416.6 405.4 309.0 313.1 317.0 0.9362\n210.0 227.0 ?17.0 433.2 421.6 319.0 322.4 325.7 0.9260\n220.0 235.5 ?15.5 449.5 437.4 329.0 331.7 334.2 0.9178\n230.0 243.9 ?13.9 465.5 453.0 339.0 340.9 342.6 0.9118\n240.0 252.2 ?12.2 481.4 468.5 349.0 350.0 350.9 0.9080\n250.0 260.5 ?10.5 497.1 483.8 359.0 359.1 359.2 0.9066\n260.0 268.8 ?8.8 512.9 499.2 9.0 8.2 7.5 0.9076\n\n270.0 277.1 ?7.1 528.7 514.6 19.0 17.3 15.8 0.9108\n280.0 285.5 ?5.5 544.7 530.1 29.0 26.5 24.1 0.9164\n290.0 294.0 ?4.0 560.9 545.9 39.0 35.8 32.6 0.9242\n300.0 302.6 ?2.6 577.5 562.0 49.0 45.1 41.3 0.9341\n310.0 311.5 ?1.5 594.4 578.5 59.0 54.5 50.2 0.9458\n320.0 320.6 ?0.6 611.8 595.4 69.0 64.1 59.3 0.9592\n330.0 330.0 0.0 629.7 612.9 79.0 73.8 68.7 0.9740\n340.0 339.7 0.3 648.2 630.8 89.0 83.7 78.3 0.9897\n350.0 349.7 0.3 667.3 649.4 99.0 93.7 88.3 1.0060\n\n360.0 360.0 0.0 687.0 668.6 109.0 103.9 98.7 1.0224\n\nTable 15.4 :Correspondence between areocentric longitude LS and the day (expressed\n\nin days or in sols).

Relation with the Date on Earth. To find the longitude LS from\nthe date expressed in the form D = (year month day hour), it is convenient to\nbegin by transforming the date D into a Julian date denoted by JD. We cal-\nculate the difference with a date JD0, known as the time of passage of Mars\nat the vernal equinox. We can take\n\nD = 31 July 2013 ??? JD0 = 2,456,505.1 =? LS = 0 .\n\nThis differences gives\n\nDd = JD ? JD0 [mod Ntro] .\n\nAll these quantities are in Earth days.\nWe can go from Dd to Ds (in sol) using the coefficient given by (15.4) and\n\nwe obtain LS as indicated above.\n\nExample 15.1 Calculate the solar areocentric longitude for the date 20\nDecember 2012 at 20:12.\n\n?

The seasons are named\nas on Earth, e.g., the northern spring or southern autumn corresponds to LS\nbetween 0? and 90?, etc. On Mars, the lengths of the seasons are not the\nsame as on Earth, but the differences in their lengths are greater than on\nEarth: 193 sols for the spring, 143 sols for the autumn. The precise length of\nthe seasons is given in the table associated with Fig. 15.7.\n\nIt is sometimes useful to define the month in the same way, by an interval\nof 30? in the solar longitude, starting from the vernal equinox. (No name is\nattributed to these months, apart from the bounding values of LS.) Table 15.4\ncan be used to calculate the length of these months. The shortest (LS: 240\u2013\n270?) lasts 46.1 sols, while the longest (LS: 60\u201390?) lasts 66.7 sols, i.e., 45%\nlonger. These correspond to the passages at perihelion and aphelion, respec-\ntively, illustrating Kepler\u2019s second law. The passage at perihelion occurs at\nthe end of the northern autumn.\n\nThe exact equivalent on Earth of this division into 12 months is the par-\ntitioning of the year into 12 signs of the zodiac.20 This note should in no way\nbe interpreted as an advertisement for astrology!\n\n15.2.4 Declination\n\nWhen considering the Sun and the Earth in Chap. 7 [see Fig. 7.10 and\n(7.62)], we have already calculated the declination, expressing it as a function\nof the solar longitude. With the notation used there, we can write\n\nsin ? = sinLS sin ? . (15.18)\n\n20For the Earth, the shortest of these signs (l : 270\u2013300?) is the one containing the passage\nat perihelion (l = 282?), which lasts 29.45 days. The longest (l : 90\u2013120?) lasts 31.45 days,\ni.e., 7% longer.\n\n\n\n740 Chapter 15.

The seasons indicated are those in the northern hemisphere.\n\n\n\n15.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities 741\n\nThe declination is thus very simply obtained as a function of LS :\n\n? = arcsin(0.42562 sinLS) . (15.19)\n\nThe graph of the function is plotted in Fig. 15.7, which also shows key values\nof the declination.\n\nCalculations to find the sunrise and sunset are strictly identical to those\nfor the Earth, provided, that we continue to ignore atmospheric refraction. We\nalso define specific parallels on Mars: polar circles (64?49?N and S) and tropics\n(25?11?N and S), at slightly different values to their terrestrial counterparts.\n\n15.2.5 Equation of Time\n\nIn Chap. 7, we discussed the definition of the equation of time ET, the\nsum of the equation of center EC and the reduction to the equator ER. To\nexpress the equation of center EC = v?M , let us return to (4.96) and (4.97).\nStopping at the first order, we can replace E by v in the argument of the sine\nto obtain {\n\nv ? E ? e sin v ,\nE ?M ? e sin v , (15.20)\n\nwhich gives\n\nv ?M ? 2e sinv , (15.21)\n\nwhence (15.7) implies that\n\nEC ? 2e sin(LS ? LSp) . (15.22)\n\nThe expression for the reduction to the equator ER = ?? l defined by (7.52)\nis obtained directly from (7.51). Using the areocentric solar longitude, this\ngives\n\nER ? ? tan2\n?\n\n2\nsin 2LS . (15.23)\n\nThe equation of time is then\n\nET = 2e sin(LS ? LSp)? tan2\n?\n\n2\nsin 2LS . (15.24)\n\nTo express ET in minutes, we convert radians into minutes of time: 2? rad is\nequivalent to 1 sol, or 1,479.6min. Expressing LS in degrees, we end up with\n\nET [min] = 43.92 sin(LS ? 251)? 11.74 sin2LS . (15.25)\n\n\n\n742 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\nThe graph of the function ET is plotted in Fig. 15.8, with the graphs for EC\nand ER. Significant values of the equation of time are given in the associated\ntables.\n\nOf course, as on the Earth, EC has an annual period and ER a period\nof half the length. However, on Mars, the amplitude of EC is four times the\namplitude of ER, and ET reaches large values (with a maximum of 53min).\nRecall here that ET = LMT? LAT.\n\nExpressions for the Declination and the Equation of Time.To end this\nsection, note that the expressions for the declination and the equation of time\nare simpler for Mars than they are for the Earth. This happens because, for\nMars, we use LS as the variable, which amounts to using the true anomaly,\nspecifying the position of the Sun directly. For the Earth, we use the day,\nrelated to the mean anomaly, which is only indirectly related to the position\nof the Sun.\n\n15.3 Satellite in Real Orbit\n\n15.3.1 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nIt is no simple matter to put a satellite in orbit around Mars. However,\nwhen the probe, launched from Earth, is captured by the Martian gravitational\nattraction, and if it is captured without simply crashing into the surface of\nthe planet, in other words, once Mars has become the attractive center of the\nsatellite\u2019s orbit, its motion can be determined in exactly the same way as all\nthe motions we have been discussing up to now with the Earth as the central\nattracting body. In order to study the Keplerian motion of a given satellite,\nwith semi-major axis a, we need only replace the geocentric gravitational\nconstant ? = GMEarth by the areocentric gravitational constant ? = GMMars,\nas given in Table 15.1.\n\nGiven the radius of the planet, we use (5.5) and (5.6) to define the periods\nT0 and T0(h=0). This yields\n\nT0(h=0) = 100.15min , (15.26)\n\nand T0 is obtained as a function of ? = a/R or h = a ? R using (5.8). We\nhave indicated certain orbits (LMO and SMO) on the graph of this function\nin Fig. 15.5. Their significance will be discussed below. This figure could be\ncompared with Fig. 5.2.\n\n15.3.2 Perturbative Accelerations\n\nThe only difference in the calculation of the Keplerian orbit for the Earth\nand for Mars is the value of ?, as noted above. For the true orbit, perturbing\nterms must be taken into account, and these are of the same kind for Mars\n\n\n\n15.3 Satellite in Real Orbit 743\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330 360\n-60\n\n-50\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\nBoreal Spring Boreal Summer Boreal Autumn Boreal Winter\n\nAreocentric Longitude (deg)\n\nE\nqu\n\nat\nio\n\nn \nof\n\n ti\nm\n\ne \n(m\n\nin\n)\n\nMARS\n\nLS [deg] D [sol] ET [min]\n\n0 0 +41.52\n2 4 +40.00\n\n28 57 +20.00\n57 120 0.00\n\n110 237 ?20.00\n173 360 ?40.00\n191 391 ?42.43\n207 417 ?40.00\n238 465 ?20.00\n257 495 0.00\n275 522 +20.00\n296 556 +40.00\n328 609 +53.36\n360 669 +41.52\n\nET\nEC\n\nEREC\n\nER\n\nFig. 15.8 :Graph of the equation of time ET, sum of the equation of center EC and\n\nthe reduction to the equator ER, as a function of the areocentric solar longitude LS.\n\nTable: Particular values of ET, with corresponding values of LS in degrees, and of\n\nthe date D in sols.

In the range of variation considered,\n\nthe curves are approximately straight lines and their slope is indicated. The altitudes\n\nof two types of satellite have also been noted.\n\n\n\n15.3 Satellite in Real Orbit 745\n\nas for Earth. Figure 15.9 shows the various accelerations affecting the motion\nas a function of the distance r from the satellite to the center of the planet.\nThis corresponds to Fig. 6.1 for the Earth. The notation for the accelerations\nis the same as in Table 6.1.\n\nConservative Forces\n\nThe central acceleration ?CCC has slope p = ?2 on a log\u2013log scale. Like-\nwise, the acceleration due to the term in J2 and those due to the following\nterms J4, J6, and so on, follow the same pattern as their counterparts for the\nEarth, i.e., p = ?4 for ?CCN.J2, p = ?6 for ?CCN.J4, etc. At the origin h = 0,\nnumerical values are\n\n?CCC(R) = g(R) = g0 = 3.73ms\n?2 ,\n\n?CCN.J2(R) = 7.4\u00d7 10?3ms?2 , ?CCN.J4(R) = 1.2\u00d7 10?4ms?2 .\n\nThe lunisolar attraction on a terrestrial satellite is simply replaced here by the\nsolar attraction, which is weaker than on Earth. As for the Earth, its value is\nobtained from (6.151). The slope of the curve is p = +1 and its value at the\norigin is\n\n?CS(R) = 2\n?S\na3S\n\nR = 8\u00d7 10?8ms?2 ,\n\nwhere aS is the semi-major axis of the heliocentric orbit of Mars.\nTidal effects on the satellite are due to land tides caused by the Sun, which\n\nare much less marked than on Earth. The relativistic effect ?CR, with slope\np = ?3, is calculated in the same way as for the Earth.\nDissipative Forces\n\nSolar radiation pressure is only half the value on Mars as compared with\nthe Earth (term going as a?2S ). The albedo effect depends on the region over-\nflown. The albedo of Mars is rather low (mean value 0.22). The effect of drag\ndue to the Martian atmosphere is less than on Earth for the same reduced\naltitude, because the atmosphere on Mars is less dense and the thermosphere\nis cooler.\n\nNote on Atmospheric Drag\n\nAtmospheric models have been made for Mars, such as the Mars Climate\nDatabase (MCD) made by the Laboratoire de Me?te?orologie Dynamique (LMD,\nParis), which gives the atmospheric density in the form discussed in Chap. 6,\nwith the relation (6.112):\n\n?i(h, ?LMT, D, ?) , i = 1, 2, . . . , n , (15.27)\n\nwhere the subscript i runs over a multitude of different scenarios, such as\ntypical year, global storm, etc.\n\n\n\n746 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\nThe drag force, modifications of the orbital elements, or ?V are calcu-\nlated in the same way as for the Earth. The simplified relation (6.129) giving\n?V for eccentric orbits is particularly relevant for Mars, where aerobraking\nhas been used for several missions and will no doubt be used again in the fu-\nture. It applies whenever the eccentricity is greater than some limiting value,\ncalculating using (6.131).\n\nIf we set the condition ?teff/T < 0.1, with H = 8km, a = 4,000 km, we\nobtain the constant\n\ne > 0.03 ?? equation (6.129) is applicable .\n\n15.3.3 Secular Variation of Orbital Elements\n\nWe use the theory of perturbations to determine the evolution of the six\norbital elements of the satellite. We showed in Chap. 6 that the three met-\nric elements a, e, and i remained constant, ignoring short- and long-period\nperiodic variations. The secular variation of the angular elements is given by\n(7.1) or (7.4) for ??, (7.2) or (7.13) for ??, and (7.3) for M? , as a function of\nthe inclination i and the semi-major axis a of the orbit.\n\nThe periodic variations can be expressed with the help of the coefficient\nK0 defined by (7.7). For Mars, this coefficient can be expressed as follows,\ndepending on the units used:\n\nK0 = 3.07484\u00d7 10?6 rad s?1 , (15.28)\nK0 = 15.222\n\n?day?1 , (15.29)\nK0 = 15.640\n\n?sol?1 , (15.30)\n\nK0 = 29.047 rev(Martian yr)\n?1 . (15.31)\n\nFor given values of i and a, the precession rates are higher on Mars than on\nEarth because of the value of the J2 term, which is twice as great.\n\nThe unit for calculations is rad/s, but in graphs showing these quantities\nas a function of the inclination, we have used units of deg/sol. The nodal\nprecession rate ?? shown in Fig. 15.10 (upper) has a maximum of 15.6?sol?1 for\na = R and i = 0? or 180?. Under the same conditions, the apsidal precession\nrate ?? shown in Fig. 15.10 (lower) has a maximal value of 31.2?sol?1. The\nvalue of the critical inclination is independent of the attracting planet.\n\nExample 15.2 Calculate the nodal precession rate for the satellite ExoMars-\nTGO.\n\n? The satellite ExoMars-TGO has a circular orbit with h = 400km and\ninclination i = 74? (see Fig. 15.21 lower). We find a = 3,788 km, ? = a/R =\n1.11512. Applying (7.4), we obtain\n\n\n\n15.3 Satellite in Real Orbit 747\n\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n22\n24\n26\n28\n30\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\nInclination (deg)\n\nA\nP\n\nS\nID\n\nA\nL \n\npr\nec\n\nes\nsi\n\non\n r\n\nat\ne \n\n(d\neg\n\n/s\nol\n\n)\n\n-20\n-18\n-16\n-14\n-12\n-10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\n10\n12\n14\n16\n18\n20\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180\nInclination (deg)\n\nN\nO\n\nD\nA\n\nL \npr\n\nec\nes\n\nsi\non\n\n r\nat\n\ne \n(d\n\neg\n/s\n\nol\n)\n\nMARS\n\nMARS\n\n2.0 2.0 2.0\n\n(a/R) = 1.0\n\n(a/R) = 1.0\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.0 1.0\n\nFig. 15.10 :Precession rate for a circular or near-circular orbit in degrees per sol as a\n\nfunction of the inclination i for various values of the reduced distance, from a/R =\n\n1.0 to a/R = 2.0, in steps of 0.1. Upper: Nodal precession rate ??. Lower: Apsidal\n\nprecession rate ??. Note that the value of the critical inclination is independent of\n\nthe attractive source.\n\n\n\n748 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\n?? = ?5.6951\u00d7 10?7 rad s?1 .\nConverting units, this means that ?? = ?2.90?sol?1. We can also obtain the\nresult from Fig. 15.10 (upper), where we read off the value directly. Apply-\ning (10.2), we obtain CS = ?104.8 for the cycle relative to the Sun, which\nmeans that, every 105 sols, we find the same local overpass time. The 24 local\nhours are thus sampled more than six times every Martian year. Recurrence\ncharacteristics, Table 15.8. ?\n\nExample 15.3 Calculate the nodal and apsidal precession rates for the satel-\nlite MAVEN.\n\n? The orbital characteristics of MAVEN are as follows:\n\na = 6, 578 km , e = 0.4608 , i = 75? .\n\nThis satellite is thus in an elliptical orbit with rather low periastron given\nby hp = 150km (see Fig. 15.21 upper). The nodal precession will thus\nsweep through all local times. Precession rates are calculated using the\ngeneral formulas (7.15) and (7.16). For the nodal precession rate, we find\n?? = ?0.825?/sol, which gives a (retrograde) cycle relative to the Sun of\n306 sols. For the apsidal precession rate, we find ?? = ?0.639?/sol, so the peri-\nastron makes one round trip (in the retrograde sense) in 436 sols, or 1.5 round\ntrips per Martian year. ?\n\n15.4 Different Orbits\n\nThe classification criteria are the same as for terrestrial satellites. The\norbit can be prograde or retrograde. It can be Sun-synchronous, recurrent,\nor frozen, or none of these. In terms of altitude, we speak of high orbits for\nareostationary satellites, or stationary Mars orbit (SMO), while a low orbit is\none flying below 800km, a low Mars orbit (LMO). Here we shall be interested\nin the two types of orbit discussed in Chap. 7, i.e., planetosynchronous and\nSun-synchronous.\n\n15.4.1 Areosynchronous Satellite\n\nAreostationary Satellite\n\nWe define an areosynchronous satellite by n = ??T, and an areostationary\nsatellite by adjoining the condition i = 0. Considering the mean Keplerian\nmotion, we obtain\n\na30 =\n?\n\n??2T\n= 8.524274\u00d7 1021 ,\n\na0 = 20,427.694 km , h0 = 17,031 km .\n\n\n\n15.4 Different Orbits 749\n\nBringing the J2 term into the calculation of the period, we obtain the value\na1, which is slightly bigger than a0. In the case of a stationary satellite for\nMars, the perturbing acceleration due to the term in J2 is 13 times greater\nthan that due to the Sun, as can be seen from Fig. 15.9. Recall that this is\nnot so for a terrestrial stationary satellite, where the lunisolar perturbation is\ngreater than that due to J2. We shall take this value a1 to be the one for an\nareostationary satellite, denoting it by aGS :\n\naGS = 20,428.500 km , hGS = 17,031.5 km , (15.32)\n\n?GS =\naGS\nR\n\n= 6.014 . (15.33)\n\nThe value of ?GS for the Earth given by (7.72) is close to the value found\nfor Mars, because the same is true of the diurnal rotation periods and mean\ndensities of these two planets.\n\nThe possibility of placing satellites in areostationary orbits is currently\nunder study, e.g., the satellite MARSat (Mars Areostationary Relay Satellite).\n\nStationkeeping\n\nThe orbit of the geostationary satellite changes as time goes by:\n\n\u2022 The semi-major axis a is modified by the effects of tesseral terms in the\ngeopotential, which are much greater than for the Earth.\n\n\u2022 The eccentricity e is modified by the effects of solar radiation pressure,\nmuch less significant than for the Earth.\n\n\u2022 The inclination i is modified mainly by the action of the Sun, since the\nplane of the ecliptic in which the apparent Sun moves is tilted at 25? to\nthe plane of the (Martian equatorial) orbit.\n\nThe two moons of Mars, also in the equatorial plane, are too small to perturb\nthe motion of such a satellite.\n\nLongitudinal Acceleration\n\nHere we consider the evolution of a in more detail. As we saw in Chap. 7,\nthis phenomenon is caused mainly by the tesseral harmonic P22. Indeed, we\ncalculated this drift (through its longitudinal acceleration), first by expanding\nthe geopotential up to second order, then continuing up to third order. The\nvalues of the tesseral coefficients C22, S22, C3l, and S3l, much greater than\nfor the Earth, indicate that the shape of the Martian equator is not circular,\nand that the planet has a certain triaxiality, i.e., the ellipsoid of revolution is\nsomewhat extended along an axis perpendicular to the axis of rotation (see\nTable 15.3).\n\nExpansion of the Geopotential to Order Two. The longitudinal accel-\neration is given by (7.85). Using the Mars model MGM1025, we obtain\n\n\n\n750 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\nJ22 = 63.0691\u00d7 10?6 , ?22 = ?15.02? ,\n\nand\n\n?? = A sin 2(?? ?22) , (15.34)\n\nwith\n\n??T\n?GS\n\n=\n7.088\u00d7 10?5\n\n6.014\n= 1.1786\u00d7 10?5 rad s?1 ,\n\nA = 18\n(\n??T\n?GS\n\n)2\nJ22 = 18\u00d7 1.3891\u00d7 10?10 \u00d7 63.0691\u00d7 10?6\n\n= 157.6965\u00d7 10?15 rad s?2 . (15.35)\nFor the coefficient A in degrees per sol per sol,\n\nA = 157.6965\u00d7 10?15 \u00d7 180\n?\n\n\u00d7 (88642.7)2 = 70.992\u00d7 10?3 deg sol?2 .\n(15.36)\n\nExpansion of the Geopotential to Order Three. The required values are\nJ31 = 27.4791\u00d710?6, J33 = 6.0455\u00d710?6, and for the longitudes, ?31 = 81.41?\nand ?33 = 12.04\n\n?.\nThe acceleration is given by (7.92). Putting in the numbers gives\n\n?? = A\n[\nsin 2(?? ?22)? 0.0180 sin(?? ?31) + 0.1190 sin3(?? ?33)\n\n]\n.\n\n(15.37)\n\nThe graph of ??(?) in Fig. 15.11 gives the longitudinal acceleration ?? as a\nfunction of the longitude ?. Since longitudes are measured positively toward\nthe east, we thus have\n\n?? > 0 =? eastward displacement , ?? < 0 =? westward displacement .\n\nThe solutions of ?? = 0 are the four longitudes on the graph where ??(?)\nintersects the horizontal axis. The two stable points are on the downward\nsloping parts of the curves, and the unstable points on the upward sloping\nparts. The values are indicated in Fig. 15.11.\n\nThe four equilibrium longitudes obtained for Mars are unbelievably close\nto the terrestrial values. This is purely accidental, since the zero meridian for\nthese two planets is in each case entirely arbitrary and is in no way related to\nthe details of the geopotential.\n\nEquation (15.37) shows that it is the degree 2 harmonic which carries most\nweight.

Satellites of Mars\n\nor 75?, 165?, 255?, and 345? are very close to the four longitudes obtained\nfrom (15.37) by going up to order 3, namely, 75?, 162?, 256?, and 348?. The\ncontribution from the other terms becomes negligible from order 4 onwards,\nsince a further multiplicative coefficient 1/?GS, or 0.17, is brought in for each\nnew order.\n\n15.4.2 Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nSun-Synchronicity Constant\n\nFor Sun-synchronous satellites, we have seen that the condition ??(a, i) =\n??S must be satisfied. We begin by calculating the constant of Sun-synchronicity\nusing (7.98). For Mars, this gives\n\nkh = 29.0403 . (15.38)\n\nThis is three times the value for the Earth, because J2 is greater for Mars,\nand in addition, the planet moves more slowly around the Sun.\n\nSun-Synchronous Satellite: Circular Orbit\n\nFrom (7.104) or (7.105), we thus obtain the relation between the inclination\nand the altitude.21 Figure 15.12 (upper) shows the altitude as a function of\nthe inclination for a Sun-synchronous satellite, which is necessarily retrograde.\n\nThe minimal value of iHS, denoted by iHSmin (or im), is obtained for a\n(fictitious) satellite revolving at ground level (? = 1 or h = 0):\n\niHSmin = im = arccos\n\n(\n? 1\nkh\n\n)\n= arccos(?0.0344) = 92.0? .\n\nThe maximal value of h is obtained for i = 180? :\n\n?HSmax =\na\n\nR\n= k\n\n2/7\nh = 2.6182 ,\n\naHSmax = 8,892 km , hHSmax = 5,496 km .\n\nIt is not therefore possible to place a Sun-synchronous satellite in circular orbit\nat an altitude greater than 5,500km (roughly the same bounding altitude as\non Earth).\n\nThe US satellites MGS, Mars Odyssey, and MRO are on Sun-synchronous\norbits.\n\n21As for the Earth, there is a slight difference in the value of iHS depending on the degree\nto which the planetary potential is expanded. For h = 400 km, iHS(J4) = 92.991\n\n? and\niHS(J2) = 92.914\n\n?, i.e., a difference of 0.077?.\n\n\n\n15.4 Different Orbits 753\n\n90\n95 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 165 170 175\n\n180\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n1.9\n\n2.0\n\n2.1\n\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n2.4\n\n2.5\n\n2.6\n\n2.7\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\n3500\n\n4000\n\n4500\n\n5000\n\n5500\n\nInclination (\u00b0)MARS\n\nMARS\n\na/Rh (km)\n\n90\n100 110 120 130 140 150 160 170\n\n180\n\n0.00\n\n0.30\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\n0.55\n\n0.60\n\n0.65\n\n0.70\n\n0.75\n\ne\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2.0\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3.0\n\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\n3.6\n\n3.8\n\n4.0\n\n4.2\n\n4.4\n\n4.6\n\nInclination (\u00b0)\n\na/R\n\nFig. 15.12 :Altitude of a Sun-synchronous satellite as a function of the angle of in-\n\nclination for Sun-synchronous satellites.

Satellites of Mars\n\nSun-Synchronous Satellite: Elliptical Case\n\nCalculations for an elliptical Sun-synchronous orbit are done in exactly the\nsame way as for the Earth, using the fundamental relation (7.112), within a\nlimiting eccentricity e1 for each value of ?1 [see (7.114)]. On Mars, the possible\nrange of eccentricities is greater than for the Earth (see Fig. 15.12 lower). For\ni = 180?, the reduced distance a/R ranges from ? = 2.6182 for e = 0 to\n? = ?1 = 4.4032 for e = e1 = 0.7729.\n\nWhen the orbit is eccentric, one must add to the Sun-synchronicity con-\ndition the constraint that the periastron should not drift on the orbit. One\nmust therefore choose the critical inclination given by (6.79), which neces-\nsarily implies the value i = 116.6?. For this inclination, the reduced distance\nvaries between ? = 2.069 for e = 0 and ? = 2.847 for the maximal eccentricity\ne1 = 0.649 (see Example 15.9).\n\n?\n\nThroughout the remainder of this chapter, we shall adopt precisely the same\npresentation for Martian satellites as we did for terrestrial ones. Each Martian\nsection will be a carbon copy of the terrestrial one.\n\n?\n\n15.5 Ground Track of a Satellite\n\n? Chapter 8. The representation of the ground track gives fundamentally\nsimilar results for terrestrial and Martian satellites. Even the Snyder projec-\ntion (where the ground track appears as a straight line) can be applied directly\nusing the frequency ?. The only difference with the Earth is that we do not\nyet have any equivalent of the NORAD TLE for Mars!\n\n15.5.1 Representing the Ground Track\n\nThe ground track of an LMO satellite has the same general appearance as\nthe ground track of an LEO satellite. Example 15.4 brings out this similarity.\nFor satellites in circular orbit, the equation of the ground track takes the form\n(8.47) when the time is eliminated, using a suitable value of ?. For operational\nSun-synchronous satellites (see Table 15.6) for which ? = ?, we have\n\n? = 13? 233/550 = 6717/550 = 12.212727 , for MGS ,\n? = 12 + 15/32 = 399/32 = 12.468750 , for ODY (Mars Odyssey) ,\n\n? = 13 + 65/349 = 4602/349 = 13.186246 , for MRO .\n\n\n\n15.5 Ground Track of a Satellite 755\n\n\"Equivalent\" MGS\nOrbit - Ground track\n>>>>   Time span shown:   720.0 min =   0.50 day\n\nAltitude =  711.6 km a = 7089.752 km\n\nMC LMD\n\nMC LMD\n\nInclin./SUN-SYNCHRON.=  98.26 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =    99.14 min    * rev/day =14.53\n\nEquat. orbital shift  = 2758.9 km  (  24.8 \u00b0)\n\nAsc.

Satellites of Mars\n\nExample 15.4 Comparison between the ground track of Mars Global Surveyor\n(MGS), in a near-circular Sun-synchronous orbit around Mars at an altitude\nof 379 km, with the ground track of a fictitious terrestrial satellite at the same\nreduced altitude, also on a Sun-synchronous orbit.\n\n? The reduced distance ? is the same for both satellites.\n\nMGS.During its topographical phase, MGS followed a Sun-synchronous orbit\nwith h = 379km. We calculate the reduced distance as\n\n? =\na\n\nR\n=\n\n3775.1\n\n3196.2\n= 1.1116 .\n\nWe obtain the inclination of the Sun-synchronous satellite MGS using (7.105):\n\niHS = arccos\n\n(\n?1.1116\n\n2/7\n\n29.0403\n\n)\n= 92.03? .\n\nExpanding beyond the J2 term for the nodal precession rate, we obtain\n\niHS = 92.93\n? .\n\nThe ground track of the satellite thus lies between the geocentric latitudes\n87.07?N and 87.07?S. It is shown in Fig. 15.13 (upper) over half a Martian\nday (half a sol). With 12.6 round trips per sol, the equatorial shift is 29?.\n\nEquivalent MGS. To compare the orbits and ground tracks on Mars and\non Earth, we calculate the characteristics of a terrestrial satellite at the same\nreduced altitude, i.e., the same reduced distance from the attractive center of\nthe planet, and hence the same value for ?. We call this fictitious satellite the\nequivalent MGS for the Earth. With ? = 1.1116, we obtain a = ? \u00d7 6378 =\n7,090km, or h = 712km.\n\nWe deduce the inclination to be\n\niHS = 98.26\n? .\n\nThe ground track of the satellite lies between 81.74?N and 81.74?S. It is shown\nin Fig. 15.13 (lower). With 14.5 round trips per day, the equatorial shift is 25?.\nWe note here the main difference:\n\n\u2022 The inclination of the Sun-synchronous Martian satellite is more polar, i.e.,\nkh is greater for Mars than for the Earth.\n\n\u2022 The equatorial shift is a little greater for the Martian satellite, because\nits period is longer, since Mars has a lower mean density than Earth [see\n(16.3)].\n\n?\n\nExample 15.5 Orbit and ground track of Mars Express over a cycle of 4 sols.\n\n\n\n15.5 Ground Track of a Satellite 757\n\nFig. 15.14 : Infrared image of the Martian South Pole, taken using THEMIS aboard\n\nMars Odyssey on 31 October 2001.

The velocities wE are said to be relative because they\nrepresent the velocity of the ground track relative to the planet. The results\nare given in Table 15.5. If we compare a terrestrial satellite with a Martian\none at the same relative altitude, we find that the periods are roughly the\n\n\n\n15.6 Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse 763\n\nFig. 15.19 :Oblique view of Coprates Chasma, the eastern part of Valles Marineris.\n\nThe canyon is 8 km deep.

Compare with Fig. 10.13.\n\n\u2022 But for hours, a word of warning is in order. It is usual to indicate the\nLMT overpass time as for the Earth, e.g., 22:30 LMT. In this case, the\noverpass occurs 22.5 h after midnight, where the hour is here the fraction\n1/24 of a sol. To avoid confusion, we shall avoid using the word \u201chour\u201d\nwhen speaking of Mars, but use instead \u201csol/24\u201d.\n\nThe quantity P , in round trips per (Martian) year, is used to calculate the\ncycle CS, in sols, from (10.2) to (10.4).\n\n15.6.1 Overpass Time for a Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nFor Sun-synchronous satellites, the overpass time is obtained as a function\nof the latitude using (10.9). The value of the coefficient to adjust for units is\nthe same as on Earth: if times are in sol/24 and angles in degrees, K = 15,\nsince 1 sol corresponds to 360?.\n\nThe graph of the curve giving the latitude ? as a function of ?? = ???AN\nis shown in Fig. 15.22. Comparing with Fig. 10.13 (lower), the equivalent for\nthe Earth, we see that on Mars there is no significant change with altitude\nfor a satellite in low orbit: this is due to the high value of the constant of\nSun-synchronicity kh.\n\n\n\n15.6 Orbit Relative to the Sun: Crossing Times and Eclipse 767\n\nOverpass times are chosen for Sun-synchronous satellites on Mars22 on the\nbasis of roughly the same considerations as on Earth. To obtain useful lighting\nconditions, one requires the satellite to cross the equator about 2 h before or\nafter midday. In order to benefit from a maximal illumination of the solar\npanels, a dawn\u2013dusk orbit is favoured. See Figs. 15.23 and 15.24.\n\n15.6.2 Eclipse Conditions\n\nThe angle between the orbital plane and the direction of the Sun, called\nthe ? angle, is calculated in exactly the same way as for the Earth. It can be\nused to obtain the period and length of eclipse.\n\nSolar eclipse is a highly critical phenomenon for a Martian satellite. One\nreason is that the solar constant is only half the value on Earth. Another is\nthat electrical energy storage requires accumulators that considerably increase\nthe mass of the probe to be placed in orbit.\n\nDawn\u2013Dusk LMO Orbit\n\nWe consider a Sun-synchronous dawn\u2013dusk low-orbiting satellite, with\n?AN = 06:00 or 18:00. Equation (7.103) is satisfied when ? lies between 1.1354\nand 2.2930, which gives, in terms of the altitude,\n\nno eclipse ?? 460 km < h < 4,391 km .\n\nThe altitude range without eclipse is much broader than on Earth. This is\nexplained by the fact that the Martian Sun-synchronous orbit is more polar\nthan the equivalent terrestrial orbit for the same relative altitude (and this in\nturn is due to the higher value of kh).\n\nThe satellite InterMarsNet, in a Sun-synchronous dawn\u2013dusk orbit with\nh = 612 km, would have escaped eclipse. The communications satellite Mars\nTelecomm Orbiter (MTO), at altitude h = 4,450km, Sun-synchronous with\niHS = 130.2\n\n?, would have suffered very little eclipse in a dawn\u2013dusk orbit23\n\n06:00 or 18:00. With h = 4,391km, iHS = 128.9\n?, there is no eclipse for this\n\ntype of orbit.\nFigure 15.25 shows the length of solar eclipse over one revolution for var-\n\nious low altitudes as a function of the declination, and Fig. 15.26 (upper) the\nsame as a function of the areocentric solar longitude, which can be related to\nthe date.\n\n22At the beginning of a mission, a dawn\u2013dusk orbit is generally used. Indeed, the transfer\nof a space probe from Earth to Mars is made along a trajectory which is tangential to\nthe orbit of Mars, as viewed in the heliocentric frame, at the time of insertion, when the\nprobe becomes a satellite of Mars. The satellite orbit is then perpendicular to the Sun\u2013Mars\ndirection, and is therefore a dawn\u2013dusk orbit. The same reasoning would apply to a satellite\nof Venus.\n\n23With the planned configuration, eclipse would occur on 395 sols per Martian year, with\na daily maximum of 47min.\n\n\n\n768 Chapter 15.

When we consider the question of recurrence on Mars, we\nencounter the same advantages and constraints as we have already seen on\nEarth. Everything discussed in Chap. 11 applies equally to Mars, provided of\ncourse that we use sols instead of days.\n\n15.7.1 Recurrence\n\nRecurrence for Sun-Synchronous Satellites\n\nWe have just seen that the altitude of a Martian Sun-synchronous satellite\nlies between the theoretical bounds h = 0 and h = 5,496km, which corre-\nsponds to the values ? = 14.73 and ? = 3.49 of the daily orbital frequency,\nrespectively. The altitudes chosen for Sun-synchronous satellites in missions\nunder development or already carried out are generally less than 600km.\n\nThe recurrence diagram in Fig. 15.27 allows one to visualise the altitudes\nleading to different recurrence configurations on Mars. This diagram is the\ncounterpart of Fig. 11.2 for the Earth. Recurrent satellites on Mars are shown\nin Table 15.6 and Fig. 15.28. Given the recurrence triple (which is in prin-\nciple maintained throughout the mission), one can accurately determine the\ncharacteristics of the orbit.\n\nExample 15.7 Calculate the orbital characteristics of the satellites Mars\nGlobal Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.\n\n\n\n774 Chapter 15.

For altitudes between\n\n250 and 530 km, the possible recurrence cycles are indicated by the value of DTo .\n\nBoxed values correspond to the exact recurrence cycles appearing in Table 15.6, or\n\nto approximate, but shorter cycles determined in Example 15.7. For example, for\n\nMars Odyssey (ODY), we have the triple [12, +1, 2], or ?o = 12 (the integer closest\n\nto ?, as ordinate), DTo = +1 (indicated on the diagram), and CTo = 2 (as abscissa).\n\n\n\n15.7 Orbit Relative to Mars: Recurrence and Altitude 775\n\n? All three satellites are Sun-synchronous.\n\nMars Global Surveyor (MGS). The probe Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)\nleft its heliocentric cruise on 12 September 1997 for a highly eccentric areo-\ncentric orbit with hp = 258 km, ha = 54,021km, e = 0.88, T = 45h, known as\nMars orbit insertion (MOI). The aerobraking maneuver lasted for 16 months,\nduring which many scientific measurements were carried out, in particular\non the magnetic field. The solar panels did not deploy correctly, extending\nthe time required for aerobraking. In February 1999, the final orbit was near-\ncircular, Sun-synchronous, recurrent, and frozen. The satellite MGS then en-\ntered its mapping phase. The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) then\nbegan to make very precise topographic measurements of the planet.\n\nWith recurrence maintained at 6,917 revolutions in 550 sols, the draconitic\nperiod is given by\n\nTd =\n550\n\n6917\nsol = 117.64min .\n\nTo begin with, we set T0 = Td, and thereby deduce the inclination and radius\na0 = 3,781 km of the Keplerian orbit. We calculate the rate of secular variation\nof the angle elements. We deduce the anomalistic period Ta = 117.5090min,\nthen the values of the semi-major axis and the inclination, viz.,\n\na = 3,775.088 km , i = iHS = 92.90\n? .\n\nMars Odyssey. The probe Mars Odyssey reached Mars on 24 October 2001\nand went into a high and highly eccentric Martian orbit (T ? 18.6 h). Aer-\nobraking eventually led on 30 January 2002 to a Sun-synchronous (?AN =\n04:30) circular orbit close to 400km (T ? 2 h), with the satellite ground track\nrepeating every 2 days. The recurrence diagram in Fig. 15.27 shows that, at\nthis altitude, a recurrence cycle over 2 sols corresponds to the triple [12, 1, 2],\n? = 12.5, with 25 revolutions per cycle. The draconitic period is therefore\n\nTd =\n2\n\n25\nsol = 118.36min ,\n\nand the various intervals discussed in Chap. 11 are ? = 360/25 = 14.4?,\n?D = ?, ?R = 2?. By iterative calculation, we obtain the semi-major axis\na = 3,790.496km and the inclination i = iHS = 92.95\n\n?. In fact, during the\nscience part of the mission, for each 2-sol repeat cycle, the ground track shifts\na small amount (53 km) at the equator (see Fig. 15.15). This shift by 0.9?, de-\nnoted here by ??, can be considered as the grid interval of a longer cycle. After\n??/? = 0.9/14.4 = 16 cycles of 2 sols, the ground track has thus shifted by an\ninterval ?, which means that, after 16 cycles of 25 revolutions, the satellite,\nwith this new recurrence characteristic, has made one revolution less, i.e., 399\nrevolutions in 32 sols. The recurrence triple is then [12, 15, 32]. The draconitic\nperiod is\n\n\n\n776 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\nTd =\n32\n\n399\nsol = 118.66min ,\n\nand we recover the grid interval ? = 360/399 = 0.9?. We then obtain\n\na = 3,796.847 km , i = iHS = 92.96\n? .\n\nIt should be noted that the satellite Mars Odyssey is not strictly Sun-\nsynchronous, since its LMT crossing time varied continuously from 03:23 to\n05:20 during the 917 (Earth) days of the science mission, then from 05:20 to\n06:50 during the 800 following days.\n\nMars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The probe Mars Reconnaissance\nOrbiter (MRO) came under the control of the Martian gravitational field\non 11 March 2006, entering a highly elliptic polar orbit with hp = 426km,\nha = 44,500km, ? = 270\n\n?, and period T = 35h. After 5 months of aerobraking\n(over 445 revolutions), the orbit of the MRO was near-circular. NASA gave\nthe following indications: hp = 255 km, ha = 320km, frozen Sun-synchronous\norbit with recurrence over 349 sols, with 4,602 revolutions.\n\nTo obtain the latitude of the apsides and calculate the radius R? of the\nplanet at this location, using (1.37) or (1.39), we carry out an approximate\ncalculation of iHS. With i = 93\n\n?, we may take R? = Rp = 3,630km (polar\nradius). We deduce that\n\nrp = Rp + 255 = 3,630 km , ra = Rp + 320 = 3,695 km =? a = 3,662.5 km .\n\nWe obtain e = 8.87 \u00d7 10?3, which corresponds to the frozen eccentricity eF.\nEquation (11.55), with ?F = ?90? and iHS = 92.7?, yields eF = 7.7 \u00d7 10?3.\nThe draconitic period is\n\nTd =\n349\n\n4602\nsol = 120.20min ,\n\nwhich implies that ? = ? = 13.1862. The orbital elements can be found from\nthe values of eF and ?, with the result\n\na = 3,657.4 km , e = 0.00887 , i = iHS = 92.60\n? , ? = ?F = 270?.\n\nMission control indicates a recurrence cycle of 16 sols. With this subcycle, a\nsmall shift of 30.6 km is observed at the equator over 211 revolutions, between\nthe tracks at 16 sol intervals. ?\n\nExample 15.8 Calculate the orbital characteristics of InterMarsNet.\n\n? The InterMarsNet mission was a European project in collaboration with\nthe United States. This project, planned for 2003, was abandoned in 1996\nand more or less replaced by Mars Express, for launch in 2003. We have\n\n\n\n15.7 Orbit Relative to Mars: Recurrence and Altitude 777\n\nincluded it here as an example because of its interesting orbit, which is Sun-\nsynchronous, dawn\u2013dusk, with 2-sol recurrence, frozen and eclipse-free. With\na recurrence of 23 revolutions in 2 sols, we obtain\n\nTd =\n2\n\n23\nsol = 128.66min .\n\nCalculation yields a = 4,007.867km and inclination iHS = 93.61\n?. ?\n\nExample 15.9 Calculate the characteristics of a Sun-synchronous satellite\nwith 1-sol recurrence and critical inclination.\n\n? Preliminary orbital studies for the Russian satellite Mars-96 considered an\norbit that would have been Sun-synchronous and also have had the critical\ninclination. We re-examine this idea here, but adding the further constraint\nthat the satellite should be 1-day recurrent, an interesting configuration for\nlinks with ground bases. We have calculated the following orbital characteris-\ntics, with three different recurrence cycles, considering eccentricities e = 0.30,\ne = 0.45, and e = 0.60:\ne = 0.30 , a = 6,993.892 km , i = 116.6 , phase triple [5, 0, 1] ,\n\nhp = 1,499 km , ha = 5,695 km , T = 296.01min (5 rev/day) ,\ne = 0.45 , a = 8,113.554 km , i = 116.6 , phase triple [4, 0, 1] ,\n\nhp = 1,065 km , ha = 8,368 km , T = 369.86min (4 rev/day) ,\ne = 0.60 , a = 9,827.020 km , i = 116.6 , phase triple [3, 0, 1] ,\n\nhp = 533 km , ha = 12,326 km , T = 493.01min (3 rev/day) .\nThe satellite Ellipso Borealis has this type of orbit around the Earth. ?\n\nRecurrence for a Non-Sun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nMars Express is in a recurrent non-Sun-synchronous elliptical orbit, with\nseveral recurrence cycles during the mission.\n\nExample 15.10 Characteristics of the various orbits of Mars Express, de-\npending on its recurrence.\n\n? The European satellite Mars Express, launched from Baikonur on 2 June\n2003, arrived on Mars on 25 December and went into a highly eccentric near-\npolar insertion orbit (known as MOI), with i = 86.35?. This was quickly\ntransformed into a recurrent elliptical orbit characterised by 13 revolutions\nin 4 sols (the so-called 3G-u orbit), then by 11 revolutions in 3 sol (the 3G-b\norbit). It remained in 3G-u from the beginning of January to 2 May 2004\n(revolutions 1\u2013372), then went into 3G-b, where it remained from 6 May up\nuntil the end of the main mission, on 11 November 2007 (revolutions 386\u2013\n4,955).\n\n\n\n778 Chapter 15.

For more de-\n\ntails, see the caption to Table 15.7.\n\nSubsequently, with a slight increase in the semi-major axis a, MEx moved\nto a recurrence of 18 revolutions in 5 sols (the 18:5 orbit), from 16 December\n2007 to 11 January 2009 (revolution 5,082\u20136,458), then to a recurrence of 25\nrevolutions in 7 sols (the 25:7 orbit). The thinking behind these changes was\nto optimise scientific observations and maintain the periastron on the daylight\nside for as long as possible, since high resolution observations are made there.\n\nThe characteristics of the orbits are given in Table 15.7. As for Mars\nOdyssey, the orbits are not strictly recurrent. For G3-u, with ? = 360/13 =\n27.70?, ?R = 4? = 110.77?, the ground track shifts by ?? = 1.09? after each\ncycle of 4 sols. ?\n\nSatellites with 1-Day Recurrence\n\nAs on Earth, low-orbiting (LMO) satellites aroundMars should in principle\navoid 1-day recurrence cycles. For example, a Sun-synchronous satellite at\naltitude h = 500km would find itself in this situation, as is clear from the\nrecurrence diagram. Every day it would pass over the same ground track,\nunable to observe other regions. Table 15.9 lists altitudes leading to such\nrecurrence, for Sun-synchronous and non-Sun-synchronous satellites.\n\n\n\n15.7 Orbit Relative to Mars: Recurrence and Altitude 779\n\n? i = 20 i = 65 i = 110 i = iHS\n\nh h h h iHS\n\n14 48.6 81.2 146.0 117.6 92.3\n13 237.0 263.8 321.0 296.2 92.7\n12 449.0 470.6 520.6 499.2 93.3\n11 690.5 707.4 750.7 732.6 94.0\n\nTable 15.9 :Orbital and recurrence characteristics for satellites with 1-sol recurrence\n\ncycles.

There is no difference with a terrestrial satellite, except that, for\nSun-synchronous satellites, the inclination iHS depends on the planet.\n\n25\n\nRecurrence Index\n\nThe recurrence index indicates cycles and subcycles. For satellites with\nvery long recurrence cycle, such as MGS or MRO, the index carries much\ninformation.\n\nExample 15.11 Recurrence index for the very long cycle Sun-synchronous\nsatellites MGS and MRO.\n\n? These two satellites have near-circular Sun-synchronous orbits.\n\nMGS. The recurrence cycle is very long, viz., CTo = 550 sol over 6917 revo-\nlutions (see Fig. 15.29 upper). The graph in the figure has a secondary peak\nfor 7 sol (over 88 revolutions), and significant peaks for 26 sol (over 327 rev-\nolutions), . . . , and 144 sol (over 1,811 revolutions). The MGS/JPL nomen-\nclature distinguishes three cycles: the repeat cycle (7 sol), the mapping cycle\n(26 sol), and the super cycle (550 sol). The instrument MOLA aboard MGS is\na laser,26 which of course has an extremely narrow beam. The very long cycle\nthus leads to a very small ground track interval,27 ensuring complete coverage\n\n25For the satellite Mars Odyssey, with a 2-sol recurrence cycle and using the notation of\nChap. 11, we obtain the following results. For d = 1, 3, 5, 7, . . . ,MTo = 27, the geocentric\nlatitudes are ? = 26.6, 62.9, 76.0, 80.9, . . . , ?m = 87.1 = 180? iHS (see Fig. 15.15 lower).\n\n26On Earth, where cycles CTo rarely exceed 40 days, altimetric satellites like ICESat\nequipped with lasers also have a very long cycle.\n\n27The beam angle of the MOLA laser is 2f = 0.85mrad (or 3 arcsec), which gives a\nspot on the ground of width ? = 2fh = 320m.

The recurrence cycle is slightly shorter than the one for MGS, with\nCTo = 349 sol over 4,602 revolutions (see Fig. 15.29 lower). The graph in the\nfigure has a significant peak for 102 sol (over 1,345 revolutions) and secondary\npeaks for 5 sol (over 66 revolutions), 11 sol (over 145 revolutions), and 16 sol\n(over 211 revolutions). This last subcycle corresponds to the recurrence triple\n[13, +3, 16] 211 (see Fig. 15.28). ?\n\n15.7.2 Altitude\n\nRecall that we define the altitude of a satellite as a function of the angle\n? giving the position on orbit (see Chap. 11). This altitude h(?), expressed in\n(11.47), is obtained as the difference between the distance r(?) to the center\nof the planet (the center of attraction) and the radius RT(?) of the reference\nellipsoid (the distance of the subsatellite point on the ellipsoid from the center\nof the planet). Here we consider the geocentric altitude (height).\n\nFrozen orbits are less circular than on Earth, for two reasons:\n\n\u2022 The flattening of Mars is more pronounced.\n\u2022 The frozen eccentricity eF given by (11.57) is greater, because the ratio\n\n|J3/J2| is equal to 18.363\u00d7 10?3 for Mars, whereas it is 2.339 \u00d7 10?3 for\nthe Earth.\n\nWe also note that, since J3 and sin?F must have opposite signs, the position\nof the frozen periastron is given by ?F = 270\n\n? for recurrent Sun-synchronous\nsatellites. The periastron of the frozen Sun-synchronous orbit is practically\nover the South Pole.\n\nExample 15.12 Altitude of the satellite MGS during the topographic phase\nand the satellite MRO during the first scientific phase.\n\n? These two satellites have frozen orbits.\n\nMGS. The variation in altitude of the satellite MGS is shown in Fig. 15.30\n(upper) over one period as a function of the position on orbit ?. The values\nof the orbital elements provided by NASA are those for a given revolution\n(indicated in the figure) during its topographical phase. As the orbit is main-\ntained and frozen, we may consider that the variation h(?) does not change\n\ninterval ? (expressed as a length) is ? = 2?R/6917 = 3.085 km. At the equator, we thus\nhave ?/? ? 1/10.\n\n\n\n782 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\nfrom one revolution to another. We note that the position ?F of the frozen\nperiastron is at 7? from the ideal position. If we calculate the frozen eccen-\ntricity using (11.57) with the orbital elements provided in Table 15.6, we find\neF = 8.25\u00d710?3. This result is close to the true value for the revolution under\nconsideration, viz., eF = 8.87\u00d7 10?3.\n\nMRO. The variation in altitude of the satellite MRO is shown in Fig. 15.30\n(lower) over one period as a function of the position on orbit ?, during the\nfirst Martian year after it was placed in orbit (the primary science phase). The\naltitude depends only on the latitude, regardless of whether the orbit is in its\nascending or descending part. In the caption to Fig. 15.34 and Example 15.16,\nwe indicate the altitude communicated by JPL/NASA, viz., h = 297.5km.\nUsing (6.64) with ? = 42.2? and i = 92.6?, we obtain\n\nsin? =\nsin 42.2\n\nsin 92.6\n, ? = 44.3? .\n\nThis is indeed the value given by the graph.\n\nFor MRO and MGS, the altitude profiles are very similar, with practically\nidentical values of eF and ?F. ?\n\n15.8 View from the Satellite\n\n? Chapter 12. All the concepts discussed in Chap. 12 apply equally to a\nMartian satellite. Adaptation to the present case will be particularly simple\nsince we used the variable ?, which is the reduced distance a/R.\n\n15.8.1 Viewing Configuration and Pixel Distortion\n\nFor an LMO satellite in circular orbit, the pixel distortion indexK is shown\nin Fig. 15.31 for various altitudes. For an SMO satellite, in high stationary\norbit, the curve K(?) is almost the same as the one for a GEO satellite on\nEarth, shown in Fig. 12.5 (lower). We obtain K = 2 for ? = 49?, K = 3 for\n? = 59?, instead of ? = 50? and ? = 61?, respectively, for the terrestrial\nsatellite. This similarity between the curves K(?) is due to the very similar\nvalues of ?GS.\n\n15.8.2 Swath Track for an LMO Satellite\n\nPossible scanning modes are the same for instruments aboard terrestrial\nand Martian satellites.

This was\nto prepare the very ambitious French\u2013American mission Mars Sample Return\n(MSR), which is still on the cards, but postponed indefinitely. ?\n\n15.8.3 Image Acquisition and Apparent Inclination\n\nImage acquisition by an instrument with narrow cross-track swath aboard\nan LMO satellite provides a good illustration of the difference between incli-\nnation and apparent inclination.\n\nExample 15.14 Remarks concerning the orientation of images acquired by\nVIS aboard Mars Odyssey and HiRISE aboard MRO.\n\n? Among the many instruments carried by Mars satellites, there is always a\nhigh-definition camera in the visible range of the spectrum: MOC for MGS,\nTHEMIS/VIS for Mars Odyssey, HiRISE for MRO, and HRSC for Mars Ex-\npress. These ever higher performance cameras can distinguish decimetric de-\ntails that can transform our understanding of the geomorphology and geology\nof the Red Planet. Here we shall examine image acquisition from an orbito-\ngraphic standpoint. We have chosen two images. In each case, north is at the\ntop of the image.\n\nMars Odyssey. Figure 15.16 was acquired by THEMIS/VIS aboard Mars\nOdyssey, with ?AN = 04:00. The Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Imaging\nSystem (THEMIS) comprises several instruments, including a visible wave-\nlength camera THEMIS/VIS. The image was taken during daytime on the\ndescending part of the orbit (retrograde since Sun-synchronous). The image\nis acquired in blocks constituting a sawtooth pattern on the image. Each\nblock is acquired instantaneously, hence perpendicularly to the orbital plane.\nThe edge of each block has inclination i. The general line of the edge follows\nthe satellite ground track. It thus has inclination i?, the apparent inclination.\nMeasuring these angles on the image, we find\n\ni = 93.0? , i? = 97.5? ,\n\nwhich agrees with the values calculated in Example 15.6.\n\n\n\n786 Chapter 15.

The High Resolution Imaging Science Exper-\niment (HiRISE) is a high-resolution camera. The image was acquired during\ndaytime, at 15:21 LMT, in the ascending part of the orbit (retrograde since\nSun-synchronous). Images are built up continuously, row by row, and the\nedges of the image follow the satellite ground track. They thus make an angle\ni? with the edge of the frame. We measure\n\ni? = 97.5? .\n\nThis can be compared with the value calculated in Example 15.6. ?\n\n15.8.4 View from an SMO Satellite\n\nWhen an areostationary (SMO) satellite views Mars, the maximal swath\nin the sense that we have defined f0 is given by (12.32). With the value of\n?GS defined by (15.33), we obtain\n\nf0 = arcsin\n1\n\n6.016\n= 9.569? = 0.1670 rad . (15.40)\n\nThe corresponding angle at the center of Mars is\n\n?0 = 90\n? ? 9.6? = 80.4? =? 2F0 = 9,535 km . (15.41)\n\nIf ?S is the longitude of the satellite S (parking longitude or longitude of\nthe subsatellite point), the longitudes viewed by S on the equator lie in the\ninterval [\n\n?S ? 80.4? , ?S + 80.4?\n]\n,\n\nand depending on the meridian ?S, latitudes are viewed over the same interval\nof 80.4? on either side of the equator.\n\nThe fraction of the planetary surface viewed by the areostationary satellite,\ncalculated using (12.38), is in this case 0.417 (or about 42%, as for the Earth).\n\nExample 15.15 Locus of points on Mars at an equal distance from the sub-\nsatellite point for an areostationary satellite.\n\n? As in Example 12.13, we plot the locus L(D). The distance D defined by\n(12.36) represents here the great circle distance between a point on Mars\nviewed by the areostationary satellite and the subsatellite point of this same\nsatellite (see Fig. 15.32 lower). D varies in steps of 250km. The subsatellite\npoint chosen in this example corresponds to the position originally proposed\nfor the equatorial NetLander of the Premier mission. ?\n\n\n\n15.8 View from the Satellite 789\n\nFig. 15.34 :Gully formation.

All the concepts discussed in Chap. 13 can be adapted to a\nsatellite of Mars. However, we should note one point that will not be discussed\nhere. When setting up a Mars mission, one must take into account the Sun\u2013\ntarget\u2013satellite\u2013Earth configuration. Indeed, while the eyes of the satellite\nmay be turned toward Mars, its ears must be oriented toward the Earth, from\nwhence come its instructions, and so must its mouth, in order to transmit\nback data.\n\n15.9.1 Examples of Sampling\n\nHere we describe an example of temporal and angular sampling in the\ncontext of our discussion of the Sun\u2013target\u2013satellite configuration.\n\nExample 15.16 Sampling table and statistical table for the wide-field instru-\nment MARCI aboard MRO.\n\n? We consider the central point of the image shown in Fig. 15.34, which has\ncoordinates 42.2?N and 312.0?E. The image was acquired by HiRISE aboard\nMRO on 12 November 2006, at 15:21 LMT. The altitude of the satellite is\nh = 297.5km. The ascending node has characteristics ?AN = ?42.436?, ?AN =\n15:30.

It monitors the Martian\nweather, including storms, clouds, and evolution of the ice caps.\n\nIn the table shown in Fig. 15.35, we have indicated:\n\n\u2022 On the horizontal axis, LMT \u201chours\u201d, which are in fact 1/24 of a sol, as\ndiscussed earlier.\n\n\u2022 On the vertical axis, sols from D = 1 for sol 287 (LS = 134?) to D = 31\nfor sol 318 (LS = 150\n\n?).\n\nWith regard to dates on Earth, this time interval corresponds to the period\nfrom 12 November to 14 December 2006.

Satellites of Mars\n\nof the satellite under the required viewing conditions is indicated by a triangle\n(see explanations in Example 13.11). We observe that half of the overpasses\noccur during the day (in the afternoon) and the other half at night (or very\nearly in the morning).\n\nThe overpass at the relevant point occurs on sol D = 1, at 15:21. The\nvertical line shows that the satellite passes exactly vertically above the relevant\npoint. Almost the same configuration is repeated for D = 17, after a subcycle\nof 16 sols (see Example 15.11).\n\nStatistics over 31 sols. We consider points of different latitudes on the\nmeridian passing through the chosen point. This is the meridian ? = 312.0?,\nor ? = 48?W. Figure 15.36 is established with:\n\n\u2022 On the horizontal axis, the solar zenith angle from 0? (zenith) to 90? (sun-\nrise or sunset).\n\n\u2022 On the vertical axis, latitudes from +90? (North Pole) to ?90? (South\nPole).\n\nWe calculate the overpasses at these different latitudes for the points along the\nselected meridian. These overpasses are indicated by dots of various colours\ndepending on the value of the viewing zenith angle. The places overflown\nare never viewed with the Sun at the zenith (?s is always greater than 32\n\n?)\nbecause the overpass time of this Sun-synchronous satellite is in the middle\nof the afternoon.\n\nNote. For the dates considered here, the declination varies from +17? to\n+12?. The many daytime overpasses marked on this graph for latitudes close\nto the North Pole are due to the polar day being particularly long. Conversely,\nfor places situated beyond latitude 88?S, it is the polar night. ?\n\n15.9.2 Sun Glint\n\nBut is there really cause to consider Sun glint on Mars? The reader may\nfind that we are going a bit too far in our parallel between Mars and the Earth.\nFor where are the lakes and oceans that might cause specular reflection?\n\nCertainly, the phenomenon is much less common than on Earth, but it does\nhappen sometimes. The image in Fig. 15.37 provides an example, acquired by\nMGS. In mid-February 1998, while MGS was in its aerobraking phase, it\nfound itself in a configuration where the Sun, the satellite, and the center of\n\nthe line indicating noon LAT does indeed pass through 11:30 LMT. (More precisely, from\n12:00 ? 0:28 = 11:32 LMT for D = 1 to 12:00 ? 0:33 = 11:27 LMT for D = 31.)\n\n\n\n15.9 Spatiotemporal and Angular Sampling 793\n\nT\nhe\n\n.0\n0\n\n5\n10\n\n15\n20\n\n25\n30\n\n35\n40\n\n45\n50\n\n55\n60\n\n65\n70\n\n75\n80\n\n85\n90\n\nM\nC\n\nLM\nD\n\nS\nol\n\nar\n Z\n\nen\nith\n\n A\nng\n\nle\n [0\n\n\u00b0 \n, 9\n\n0\u00b0\n]\n\n90\n\u00b0S\n\n80\n\u00b0S\n\n70\n\u00b0S\n\n60\n\u00b0S\n\n50\n\u00b0S\n\n40\n\u00b0S\n\n30\n\u00b0S\n\n20\n\u00b0S\n\n10\n\u00b0S 0\n\u00b0 \n\n10\n\u00b0N\n\n20\n\u00b0N\n\n30\n\u00b0N\n\n40\n\u00b0N\n\n50\n\u00b0N\n\n60\n\u00b0N\n\n70\n\u00b0N\n\n80\n\u00b0N\n\n90\n\u00b0N\n\nV\nie\n\nw\n.

Satellites of Mars\n\nFig. 15.37 :Specular reflection, or Sun glint, on Mars. The Sun, the satellite MGS,\n\nand the center of Mars are aligned. Image obtained on 18 February 1998 by the MOC\n\ncamera in low resolution mode, carried aboard MGS (revolution 136). The point P is\n\nthe center of the image, viz., 21.0?S, 4.1?W, and D = 1998 02 18 ? LS = 277? ?\ndeclination ? = ?24?. The latitude of P is ? = ?21?. The dark region above the\ncenter of the image is Sinus Meridiani. The image was acquired with a wide field of\n\nview over half a revolution, from pole to pole. It was then reprojected depending on\n\nthe latitude and longitude of each observed point, which explains the oval appearance\n\nof the object. Credit: MSSS (MOC), MGS, JPL/NASA.\n\nMars were aligned at one specific instant of time during each revolution. This\ngeometric configuration corresponds to a situation where specular reflection\ncan occur. Setting ?0 ? 0, ? ? 0, and an arbitrary value of ? in (13.23), we\ndo indeed obtain ?? = 0.\n\nOn Mars, the possibility of Sun glint depends on the physical properties\nof the surface, e.g., stone, sand, dust, and also on the physical properties of\nthe atmosphere, which may contain aerosols.\n\n\n\n15.10 Natural Satellites 795\n\n15.10 Natural Satellites\n\n15.10.1 Phobos and Deimos\n\nMars has two natural satellites, discovered in August 1877 by A. Hall.29\n\nThey have circular, equatorial orbits (i is about 1?). Their small size, of the\norder of 10 km, and their lumpy shape make them look like large rocks. Like\nthe Moon or other natural satellites, they always turn the same face towards\ntheir planet.\n\nThe largest, Phobos (a = 9,379 km, i = 1.07?, T = 0.3189 day), with\n? = 2.76, is well below the areostationary orbit.30 The second moon, Deimos\n(a = 23,459km, i = 1.79?, T = 1.2624 day), with ? = 6.91, is slightly higher.\n\nOne consequence of tidal effects is that the distance between the planet\nand its moon varies slightly in time. If the satellite is beyond the synchronous\norbit, it moves away. If it is within, it moves closer until it breaks under tidal\nforces when it reaches the so-called Roche limit, to be discussed in the next\nchapter [see (16.14)].\n\nThe Lagrange points L1 and L2 of the Mars\u2013Phobos system have been\ncalculated in Example 6.4.\n\n15.10.2 Space Exploration\n\nThe Soviet probe Phobos-2 made a novel attempt to approach the moon\nPhobos. In an equatorial orbit for 2 months from 29 January 1989, the probe\ngradually moved towards Phobos. When it was only 50m from the surface of\nPhobos, on 27 March, it ceased to transmit, just as it was about to launch its\nlanding modules.\n\n29Hall named them after the two male offspring of Ares and Aphrodite. They had the same\nweak points as their father: Phobos, ? 5)??\t? ??, \u201cfear\u201d, Deimos, ? %?????\t? ??, \u201cdread\u201d.\nHall\u2019s source was two lines from the Iliad, Book XV:\n\n6\t &\"??? ??? 7 8 9????\t ??\n??? %????)? ?? 5)??? ??\n:????0???? ?;??\t # 8 ???? 8 <#0/??? ???&??)????=\n\n\t\n??\n??? \t??????? \n ?????????\n\nIn the translation by Ian Johnston:\n\nThen he [Ares] told Terror and Flight to harness his horses,\nwhile he dressed himself in his glittering armour.\n\n30Phobos is one of the rare known examples of a natural satellite whose orbital angular\nspeed is greater than the angular speed of the planet about its own axis: it is thus below\nthe planetostationary orbit. Until certain discoveries made by Voyager-1 and 2, it was the\nonly natural satellite known to have this property. For a Martian observer, Phobos rises\nin the west and sets in the east. Seen from Phobos, Mars covers roughly half of the sky.\nIndeed, the planet is viewed from the apex of a cone with angle 2f0 = 2arcsin(1/?) = 42?.\n\n\n\n796 Chapter 15. Satellites of Mars\n\nThe mission Phobos-Grunt, already mentioned at the beginning of this\nchapter, was lost due to a failure just after launch.31 Mars Express flew close\nby Phobos on several occasions as it followed its elliptical, near-polar orbit,\nand was able to produce images and help in selecting a landing site (see\nFig. 15.38).\n\n15.10.3 View and Sampling\n\nPhobos can only be viewed from those points on Mars with latitude less\nthan |?| = ?v = 69.8?. Indeed, according to (12.15),\n\n?v = i+ arccos\n1\n\n?\n= 1.07 + 68.77 = 69.84? .\n\nThe \u201csampling\u201d of a natural satellite is represented by its synodic period. This\nperiod T ? is obtained using (8.44):\n\n1\n\nT ?\n=\n\n1\n\n1.027\n? 1\n\n0.319\n= ?2.161 day?1 ,\n\nwhich gives T ? = ?0.463 day or ?0.451 sol. The negative sign of the synodic\nperiod indicates that the relative motion occurs in the retrograde direction.\n\nConcerning Deimos, which is rather close to the areostationary orbit, only\nthose points close to the poles cannot view it. Indeed, we now have\n\n?v = i+ arccos\n1\n\n?\n= 1.79 + 81.68 = 83.47? .\n\nThe synodic period is calculated from\n\n1\n\nT ?\n=\n\n1\n\n1.027\n? 1\n\n1.262\n= +0.1811 day?1 ,\n\nwhich gives T ? = +5.52 day or +5.37 sol.\n\n31It is worth mentioning the very interesting strategy chosen here. In the first stage, the\nprobe was to enter Martian orbit in September 2012, then circularise with hp = 5,800 km\nand ha = 6,000 km. From this \u201cphobosynchronous\u201d orbit, the satellite would have softlanded\non Phobos in April 2013, staying until August. In the final stage, it was to return to Earth\nwith a piece of Phobos, in fact a sample of around 200 g.\n\n\n\n15.10 Natural Satellites 797\n\nFig. 15.38 :Phobos.

Satellites of Mars\n\n15.11 Historical Note: Kepler and the Planet\n\nMars\n\n15.11.1 Calculating the Period of Revolution\n\nAs we saw in Chap. 4 (see Fig. 4.13), the subtitle of Astronomia Nova was\nOn the motions of Mars, according to the observations of Tycho Brahe (see\nFig. 15.39). The quality of the measurements made by Tycho Brahe is well\nknown, and all the more astonishing in that they were made with the naked\neye. However, the astuteness of Kepler\u2019s interpretation was equally impressive.\nPage 131 of Astronomia Nova, reproduced in Fig. 15.40, illustrates this.\n\nKepler would chose a position of Mars on its orbit and note the time of\nobservation. Then, for each revolution, he noted the time of passage at this\nsame point, ad idem fixarum punctum (line 13 of p. 131), to deduce the length\nof the Martian year. The first passage noted32 is (lines 10 and 11 of p. 131)\n\nanno mdxc D. v Martii vesperi H. vii M. x ,\n\nwhich is the year 1590, or day (D. = die) 5 of the month of March (Martii), in\nthe evening (vesperi), at hour (H. = hora) 7, and at minute (M. = minuta) 10.\n\nThree other passages are then noted. The dates have been transcribed into\nthe modern notation in Table 15.10. Transforming these times33 into Julian\ndates (JD), it is easy to calculate the lapse of time between them and thus\nobtain the period of revolution, which represents the length of the Martian\nsidereal year.34\n\nFor this method of calculation, based on four observations at intervals of\none Martian sidereal year, the reader is also referred to Fig. 1.9. The average\nof the three values serves to make the comparison:\n\n32The attentive reader will note that we have corrected a typing error by Kepler. Instead\nof mdxcx, which means nothing as a Roman numeral, one should read mdxc for 1590.\n\n33We assume that these are the LMT times at Uraniborg, where Tycho Brahe had his\nobservatory. It is located at 55?55?N and 12?45?E on the island of Ven, which now belongs\nto Sweden. We deduce that UT = LMT (Ven) ? 51min. Another issue is whether Kepler\nused the Gregorian or the Julian calendar. Defined in 1582, the Gregorian calendar was\napplied from 1583 by the German Catholic states, but not until 1700 in Denmark and\nthe German Protestant states. The answer can be found from Kepler himself. In just one\ninstance, he specifies an observation date with the day of the week, namely, Saturday 8\nNovember 1597. In the \u201cnew\u201d calendar, this day is a Saturday, while in the \u201cold\u201d one it\nis a Wednesday. Kepler was thus using the Gregorian calendar. Note that these issues of\nlocal time and calendar are of no importance when calculating the period, which is based\non differences between dates. They are only relevant to the calculation of LS.\n\n34On a drawing with the note Copernici on p. 131 of Astronomia Nova, Kepler plotted\nwith a continuous curve the circle ?? with center ?, representing the circular trajectory of\nthe Earth as defined by Copernicus. He then plotted with a dotted curve the trajectory of\nthe Earth as he had calculated it. The Sun ? is not exactly at the center, indicating the\neccentricity of the Earth orbit. The position of the Earth indicated by ? corresponds to the\n1590 observation, while ? corresponds to 1592, ? to 1593, and ? to 1594. On the orbit of\nMars, the position ? of the planet is fixed for these four dates.\n\n\n\n15.11 Historical Note: Kepler and the Planet Mars 799\n\nFig. 15.39 :Extracts from Astronomia Nova.

Satellites of Mars\n\n15.11.2 Other Calculations for the Earth and Mars\n\nThe way Kepler used Tycho Brahe\u2019s measurements was crucial in valorising\nthem. To begin with, he placed them in a Copernican context, but in addition\nto this, he brought a wealth of mathematical knowhow. He even improved\ntheir accuracy by rigorously accounting for the precession of the equinoxes\n(Astronomia Nova, p. 131) and atmospheric refraction (Astronomia Nova,\np. 73).\n\nWe end this historical note with a few other remarkable results due to\nKepler, published in Astronomia Nova.\n\nInclination. For the inclination of Mars relative to the ecliptic plane (As-\ntronomia Nova, p. 79), Kepler noted that the details of the calculation were\nvery delicate. He obtained the value\n\ni = 1? 50\n1\n\n2\nmin\n\nin his notation, or i = 1.842? in decimal degrees.\n\nEccentricity and Semi-major Axis. Kepler calculated the eccentricity of\nthe Earth (Astronomia Nova, p. 136) and Mars (Astronomia Nova, p. 265),\nas well as the semi-major axis of the Mars orbit. He attributed 100,000 to the\nsemi-major axis of the Earth orbit (these are thus arbitrary units). The results\nare shown in Table 15.11 and compared with current values in Table 15.12.\n\n\n\nChapter 16\n\nSatellites of Other Celestial\n\nBodies\nThe princes leave first.

Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nSeveral centuries later, the astronomers of Greece were influenced by the\nBabylonians. The sky was still clear, and in their own writing, they were the\nfirst to make the formal distinction between stars and planets.1\n\n?\n\nIn the present chapter, we shall examine the motion of a satellite around\nanother celestial body, but more concisely than we have done for the Earth\nand Mars. The chapter is divided into two parts, each following practically\nthe same plan. There is a clear separation between Part A, which concerns\nthe satellites of planets, and Part B, which deals with satellites of natural\nsatellites. In the second part, to avoid confusion, a natural satellite or moon\nof a planet will be referred to by the term \u201cnatural satellite,\u201d and the term\n\u201csatellite\u201d will be reserved for an artificial or technological satellite.\n\nA \u2013 Satellite of a Planet\n\n16.1 Planets of the Solar System\n\n16.1.1 Presenting the Planets\n\nThe planets of the Solar System gravitate around its central star, the Sun.\nThey fall into two categories: the telluric planets and the giant planets.2 The\ntelluric planets3 are the four planets closest to the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth,\nand Mars. They are rather similar to one another in size and composition\n(iron and siliceous rocks). The giant planets are more remote: Jupiter, Saturn,\n\n1The word \u201cplanet\u201d comes from the Latin planeta, itself taken from the Greek ?\n\"? ??\t,\nplural of ? ?\n\"? \t?  ??\t, which means \u201ctraveller\u201d or \u201cwanderer.\u201d This word derives from\nthe root meaning \u201c to wander, to stray from the path.\u201d Indeed, the Greek astronomers\ndistinguished moving bodies (the planets, ?\n\"? ??\t (/????\t) from fixed bodies (the stars,\n(/????\t). The Indo-European root ?ster, \u201cstar,\u201d reappears in the Greek ? (/???? ????\t and\nin several branches: Germanic (with star, Stern, ster, stjerne, sta?rna, stjerners, stjrnu),\nCeltic, and Indo-Aryan (with sitara in Hindi, se?tare? in Persian). The variant ?stel gave\nrise to stella in Latin, and from there to the words we find in the Latin languages (stella,\nestrella, estrela, stea, e?toile)\n\n2One also finds the terms \u201cterrestrial\u201d and \u201cJovian,\u201d the latter being a reference to\nJupiter, from the Latin Jupiter, Jovis. Up until the Middle Ages, in the days of the geo-\ncentric astronomy in which the roles of the Sun and Earth were swapped over, the planets\nbetween the Earth and the Sun (the Moon, Mercury, Venus) were known as the inferior\nplanets, while those considered to lie beyond the Sun (Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) were\nreferred to as the superior planets.\n\n3In Latin, Terra, \u00e6 (f.) means \u201cthe Earth,\u201d but Tellus, uris (f.) is a poetic name for the\nEarth goddess, or Mother Earth, \u201cthe fertility goddess of crop and cattle\u201d (Horace).\n\n\n\n16.1 Planets of the Solar System 805\n\nUranus, and Neptune. They are much bigger than the telluric planets and have\ntotally different compositions (mainly hydrogen and helium). The radius of\nthe giant planets is determined as being the radius of an isobaric surface (at\n1 bar). It is not possible to define a ground level or obtain any geographic\nrepresentation of these planets.\n\nThe asteroid belt gravitates between these two groups. The first asteroid,\nCeres, was discovered by G. Piazzi4 at the beginning of the nineteenth century.\nThe asteroid belt is composed of thousands of rocky bodies, sometimes with\nquite strange shapes.5 Beyond the giant planets lie a small planet, Pluto, and\nthe asteroids of the Kuiper Belt.6 Still further out lies the Oort cloud,7 a\nmysterious world of comets.8 Since 2006, Pluto has been classified9 with the\nKuiper planetoids in the category of trans-Neptunian objects.\n\n4Father Giuseppe Piazzi (1746\u20131826) was an Italian astronomer. He produced a very\naccurate catalogue of more than seven thousand stars. It was on 1 January 1801, while he\nwas compiling his catalogue, that he discovered the first asteroid, which he called Ceres,\nthe patron saint of Sicily. Having identified the position of this new planet, he had to take\na break from his observations at his observatory in Palermo due to bad weather. But when\nhe went back to them later, his Ceres had disappeared. It was the young Gauss who, using\nmethods he had just developed himself, succeeded in tracking it down using the information\nprovided by Piazzi. Within 7 years, three other asteroids had been located by H. Olbers. It\nwas Gauss who showed that they all belonged to the same belt by determining the orbital\nelements.\n\n5Most of these asteroids belong to the Main Belt, between Mars and Jupiter, but some\nactually lie on the orbit of Jupiter (the Trojan asteroids mentioned in Sect. 6.12), while oth-\ners cross the trajectory of Mars and even the Earth orbit (near-Earth asteroids). Asteroids\nare numbered according to the order of their discovery, starting with 1-Ceres, which is also\nthe largest. On 1 January 2000, there were 7,722 (see Fig. 6.9). Since then, an automatic\nsystem called Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research (Linear) set up by the Lincoln Lab-\noratory at MIT has been in operation. Thousands of asteroids are discovered every year,\nincluding some 320,000 in 2012, although there has been a certain decline over the past few\nyears.\n\n6Gerard Kuiper (1905\u20131973) was an American astronomer of Dutch extraction. He dis-\ncovered the atmosphere of Titan (1945) and showed that it was made up of methane. He\nalso showed that the atmosphere of Mars was mainly composed of carbon dioxide (1947).\nHe hypothesised that the Solar System was encircled by an asteroid belt, of which Pluto\nwas a representative. Since 1992, hundreds of trans-Neptunian objects have been discov-\nered, some with a diameter of several hundred kilometers. They form what is now called\nthe Kuiper Belt or Kuiper\u2013Edgeworth Belt.\n\n7Jan Hendrik Oort (1900\u20131992) was a Dutch astronomer. From his studies of a great\nmany very long-period comets with orbits well outside the plane of the ecliptic, he deduced\nin 1950 that one should find, beyond the orbit of Neptune and the Kuiper Belt (which\nlie largely within the ecliptic), a ball-shaped rather than ring-shaped \u201ccloud,\u201d made up\nof small celestial bodies, which could be considered as a kind of cometary reservoir. The\ndiameter of this so-called Oort cloud would be some 105 astronomical units, or one light-\nyear. Gravitational perturbations, even very weak effects, would cause these comets to move\neither towards the center of the Solar System, or out towards other stars.\n\n8The word \u201ccomet\u201d comes from Latin, borrowed directly from the Greek come?te?s,\n????? \t, where it means \u201clong-haired,\u201d from the Greek ? ?)? ?  \t, \u201chair.\u201d\n\n9Many planets of the size of Pluto have been found in the Kuiper Belt since the 1990s.\nIt thus became urgent to react in some way. Keeping Pluto as a planet meant accept-\ning hundreds of others. On 24 August 2006, in its 26th General Assembly in Prague, the\n\n\n\n806 Chapter 16. Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nThe two telluric planets furthest from the Sun both have their own nat-\nural satellites: the Earth has one, the impressive Moon, while Mars has two\nminuscule followers. The giant planets each have a whole series of moons,\nsome of which are larger than Mercury or Pluto.\n\nMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn have been known since ancient\ntimes10 (the Earth itself has not been considered a planet for such a long\ntime), and have inherited in English and most European languages the names\nof the main divinities in the Roman pantheon.11 The same custom applied\nto planets discovered later: Uranus by W. Herschel in 1781, Neptune by J.G.\nGalle on 23 September 1846, using the celebrated calculations by Le Verrier\n(see Chap. 6), and Pluto by C.W. Tombaugh on 18 February 1930.\n\nAs soon as astronomers had switched to a heliocentric view of the Solar\nSystem, they were struck by the regularity or harmony (to use the term em-\nployed by Kepler) of this system. The orbits12 of the first eight planets all lie,\n\nInternational Astronomical Union (IAU) decided to establish a strict definition of what\nmight constitute a planet. The following three criteria were thus laid down:\n\n\u2022 It must be in orbit around the Sun.\n\u2022 It must have almost spherical shape (implying that the body\u2019s own gravity has dominated\n\nover internal cohesive forces, and one has hydrostatic equilibrium).\n\u2022 It must have cleared out its own orbit (implying the elimination of any body that might\n\nmove in the neighbourhood of its orbit).\n\nThe Sun is then left with eight planets. Bodies that only satisfy the first two criteria are\ncalled dwarf planets. These include Pluto and Ceres.\n\n10Including the Moon and Sun in this list, we obtain the seven \u201cplanets\u201d giving the days\nof the week in Roman times: Saturnus, Sol, Luna, Mars, Mercurius, Jupiter, and Venus.\nIn the early days of Christianity, the religious authorities were intent on wiping out any\nreference to Roman or Olympian gods. They thus imposed the sabbat on Saturn, while the\nLord (Dominus) took the place of the Sun, in the Romance languages. But for the other\ndays, they only succeeded in Portuguese and Greek (where Monday is the second day, and\nso on). In the Germanic languages, the original Roman system remains intact, sometimes\nfully visible, as in Sunday or Monday, sometimes less obvious, e.g., Friday refers to Fregga,\nwhich has the same root as friend and, like Venus, was the goddess of love.\n\n11The planet with the shortest period is associated with Mercury (Hermes in Greek):\nalways in motion, appearing and disappearing in quick leaps and bounds during the seasons,\nit is indeed well represented by the messenger of the gods. The next, the brightest and\nmost beautiful, is Venus (Aphrodite), goddess of love. Then, red as blood, her belligerent\ncompanion Mars (Ares), god of war, followed by Jupiter (Zeus), the master of Olympus,\nplenitude incarnated by a planet, benevolence in person. Beyond him, with his characteristic\nslow gait and pale countenance, Saturn, father of Jupiter. The old man recalls the idea of\ntime through a Greek play on words between his name (Kronos, ? +?)??\t? ??, from the verb\n??????, \u201cto accomplish, to achieve,\u201d with Indo-European root ?kra, like the Latin creare,\n\u201cto create,\u201d from whence came Ceres, the Roman goddess of growth and the word \u201ccereal,\u201d\netc.) and the word for time (chronos, ? ??)??\t? ??).\n\n12As an example of the kind of regularity they sought, one should mention Bode\u2019s law,\nalso called the Titius\u2013Bode law. This was an empirical relation, discovered in 1766 by the\nGerman astronomer J.D. Tietz (whose name is Latinised to Titius), then formulated and\nestablished as a law by his colleague Bode in 1778. It can be formulated as follows. Let aS\nbe the semi-major axis of the planet\u2019s orbit, expressed in astronomical units. The relation\ngives aS for the six planets known at the time:\n\naS = 0.4 + 0.3\u00d7 2n ,\n\n\n\n16.1 Planets of the Solar System 807\n\nto within a few degrees, in the same plane, known as the ecliptic. The motion,\nalong almost circular orbits, is always in the same direction, i.e., anticlockwise\nas viewed from above the north pole of the Sun. In most cases, the planets\nalso rotate in this direction about their own axes, and their natural satellites\norbit them in this direction too. Moreover, the fact that this direction is also\nthe direction of rotation of the Sun itself has long suggested that there is a\nconnection with the formation of the Solar System, as proposed in Laplace\u2019s\ntheory in Exposition du syste?me du monde, in 1796.\n\nAtmosphere of the Telluric Bodies\n\nApart from the Earth, two of the telluric planets have an atmosphere:\n\n\u2022 Venus with its gases heated to high temperatures by the greenhouse effect\n[average pressure and temperature at ground level: 90 bar, 750K; compo-\nsition: carbon dioxide gas CO2 (96%), nitrogen N2 (3%)].\n\n\u2022 Mars with its rarefied gases [average pressure and temperature at ground\nlevel: less than 10?2 bar, about 250K; composition: carbon dioxide gas CO2\n(95%), nitrogen N2 (3%)].\n\nTwo natural satellites of other planets also carry an atmosphere:\n\n\u2022 Titan, the largest natural satellite of Saturn [average pressure and tem-\nperature at ground level: 1.5 bar, 90K; composition: nitrogen N2 (98%),\nmethane CH4 (2%)].\n\n\u2022 Triton, the largest natural satellite of Neptune [average pressure and tem-\nperature at ground level: around 10?5 bar (1.5 Pa), 40K; composition: ni-\ntrogen N2 (99%)].\n\nAn atmosphere was detected around Pluto by stellar occultation in 1985 [av-\nerage pressure and temperature at ground level: a few ?bar (?0.5Pa), 43K;\ncomposition: nitrogen N2 (99%)].\n\nwhere n = ?? for Mercury, n = 0 for Venus, n = 1 for the Earth, n = 2 for Mars,\nn = 4 for Jupiter, and n = 5 for Saturn. These values can be compared with the values of\naS in Table 16.2. It appears that the result is not so bad. However, we do not have here\nthe accuracy of measurement that forms the basis for astronomy! This law, which is not\nstrictly a law in the scientific sense of the term, has raised much controversy. Is it purely\nfortuitous? Does it reflect the action of physical forces during the formation of the Solar\nSystem? Does it reveal the action of some gravitational phenomenon after the formation of\nthe planets? Today, astronomers have a preference for the first of these three hypotheses,\nbut one cannot deny at least one point in favour of this \u201claw\u201d: it has played an important\nrole in the historical development of astronomy. It was while looking for the planet n = 6,\nshortly after the formulation by Bode, that Herschel found Uranus. Then, assuming that\nthe body perturbing Uranus was in the orbit n = 7, Le Verrier was able to calculate the\nposition of Neptune. His own account shows this beyond doubt, and Adams had used the\nsame arguments. The most surprising thing is that the least good agreement between the\n\u201claw\u201d and measurement is precisely for the case of Neptune! Many astronomers had sought\nto fill the space at n = 3, until Piazzi discovered a first asteroid in the space between Mars\nand Jupiter.\n\n\n\n808 Chapter 16. Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\n16.1.2 Space Exploration of the Planets\n\nOne of the main motivations for space exploration today is the desire to\nfind traces of life, something usually associated with the presence of water\nin the liquid state. This explains in part projects to investigate Mars, or\nindeed, Europa, a Galilean moon of Jupiter, discussed further below. Another\nmotivation is sometimes the study of the atmosphere in the case of both\ntelluric and giant planets.\n\nAt the beginning of space exploration beyond the confines of the Earth,\nthe aims were different: there was thirst for knowledge about the various\nbodies making up the Solar System, driven by the quest for technological\nand ideological ascension by the two superpowers of the day, as will be seen\nfrom the brief chronology below. The main dates for this exploration are\nsummarised in Table 16.1. We indicate the year marking the beginning of the\nvarious types of mission.\n\nThe Moon and Nearby Planets\n\nIn 1959, the probe Luna-1 achieved the first lunar flyby in January, Luna-2\nlanded on the Moon in September, and Luna-3 sent the first photos of the dark\nside of the Moon back to the USSR from its October flyby (see Fig. 16.31).\nIn 1966, Luna-9 made the first soft landing in January, and Luna-10 was the\nfirst lunar satellite in March. The United States had their revenge with the\nastronauts of Apollo 11 on 20 July 1969 (see Fig. 16.32).\n\nAfter the Moon, the next target was Venus: for the United States, success-\nful flybys were operated by Mariner-2 in December 1962, Mariner-5 in Novem-\nber 1967, and the two probes Pioneer Venus-1 (or Pioneer Venus Orbiter, or\nPioneer-12) and Pioneer Venus-2 (or Pioneer Venus Probe Bus, or Pioneer-13)\nin December 1978; for the USSR, missions were carried out successfully by\nVenera-4 in October 1967, and Venera-5 and -6 in May 1969 with atmospheric\ncapsules, while the first soft landing was made by Venera-7 on 15 December\n1970, followed by other successful missions Venera-8 to -16, in perfect contrast\nto their Mars programme! Finally, the Soviets produced Vega-1 and -2 in June\n1985, releasing balloons and a landing module. As the atmosphere of Venus\nis very opaque, it was mapped by radar, from 1990 to 1994, by the American\nprobe Magellan, launched on 4 May 1989 by the shuttle Atlantis (STS-30)\nand placed in orbit around the planet on 10 August 1990. Before it, three\nprobes had carried out measurements in orbit: Pioneer Venus-1 from 1979 to\n1992 and Venera-15 and -16 from 1983 to 1986.\n\nThe probe Mariner-10 accomplished the first mission to two planets:\nlaunched on 3 November 1973, it flew by Venus on 5 February 1974, then pro-\nceeded to three encounters with Mercury,13 on 29 March 1974, 21 September\n\n13The overpasses were separated by 176 days. The probe had been placed in an eccentric\nheliocentric orbit with exactly twice the period T1 of Mercury (T = 88 day). In this case,\nthe synodic period is T ? = 2T = T1 = 176 day (see Sect. 16.4.1).\n\n\n\n16.1 Planets of the Solar System 809\n\nObject Observation Flyby Landing Orbit Sample n\n\nMoon A 1959 1959 1966 1969 64\n\nMercury A 1974 2011 2\nVenus A 1962 1966 1975 24\nEarth \u2013 1957 1961 1957 \u2013 N\nMars A 1965 1971 1971 (202x) 32\nJupiter A 1973 1995 7\nSaturn A 1973 2004 4\nUranus 1781 1986 1\nNeptune 1842 1989 1\n\nAsteroids 1801 1991 2000 2000 2010 9\n\nPluto 1930 2015 1\n\nComets A 1985 (2014) (2014) 2006 14\n\nTable 16.1 :Exploration of the Solar System.

For the Earth, N\n\nrepresents thousands of missions.\n\n1974, and 16 March 1975. The Venus flyby was the first use of a gravity-assist\nmaneuver.14\n\n14To model the trajectory of a probe from the Earth to Venus, for example, we use the\nidea of patched conics. As long as the probe is in the sphere of influence of the Earth or\nof Venus, its motion is described by a conic section with the relevant planet at the focus\n(in motion relative to the Sun). Between the two, the motion is heliocentric, described by\na conic section whose focus (the Sun) is fixed. The three conics are then patched together.\nHowever, to go from the Earth to a non-neighbouring planet (other than Venus or Mars),\none can fly close by some intermediate planet. To model the trajectory from the Earth\nto Mercury under these conditions, one must patch together five conic sections. The third\ncorresponds to a flight close by Venus (generally a branch of a hyperbola). The velocity\nrelative to Venus has the same magnitude when it enters and when it leaves the sphere of\ninfluence, but the direction is significantly changed. This is called gravitational deflection.\nIn this way the vectorial velocity relative to the Sun can be greatly modified without energy\nexpenditure. To reach Mercury, the speed must be reduced. To reach Jupiter or the more\nremote planets, the speed is increased. This kind of maneuver is called a gravitational sling-\nshot. It is used quite systematically for long-distance journeys. The probe Ulysses, launched\non 6 October 1990 to study the Sun, thereby reached a speed of 125 km/s (or 450,000 km/h).\nUsing a Jupiter swing-by, it left the plane of the ecliptic to overfly the south pole of the\nSun in 1994, then the north pole in 1995. Further examples are given below for the Galileo\nand Cassini probes.\n\n\n\n810 Chapter 16. Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nAsteroid Belt\n\nAfter Mars, discussed in the last chapter, we come to the asteroid belt.\nOn its way to Jupiter, the Galileo probe made the first flybys as it crossed\nthe Main Belt: 951-Gaspra and 243-Ida (measuring R ? 20 km). A natural\nsatellite of 243-Ida was even found, and given the name Dactyl. It is almost\nspherical, with R ? 0.7 km. The Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)\nmission, launched on 17 February 1996, observed 253-Mathilde on 27 June\n1997, before flirting with Eros on St Valentine\u2019s day 2000. We shall investigate\nits orbit shortly. Likewise, we shall return to the various orbits of Dawn, a\nNASA probe launched in 2007 to visit 4-Vesta and 1-Ceres, the brightest and\nthe biggest of the asteroids, respectively, from 2011.\n\nThe Japanese probe15 Muses-C, renamed Hayabusa (\u201cfalcon\u201d), launched\nin 2003 in the direction of 25143-Itokawa, succeeded in returning some dust\nsamples from the asteroid to Earth,16 overcoming a string of incidents on the\nway.\n\nGiant Planets\n\nJupiter. Jupiter was first overflown on 1 December 1973 by Pioneer-10,\nlaunched on 3 March 1972, then on 1 December 1974 by Pioneer-11, launched\non 6 April 1973. The latter went on to visit Saturn, flying past on 1 September\n1979.\n\nIt was the Voyager probes, making full use of the gravity-assist technique,\nthat finally revolutionised our knowledge of the outer planets. NASA took ad-\nvantage of an exceptional alignment of the planets from Jupiter to Neptune at\nthe beginning of the 1980s to accomplish with these two probes what became\nknown as the Grand Tour. Such a favourable configuration only occurs about\nonce every 180 years.\n\nVoyager-1, launched on 5 September 1977, flew past Jupiter on 5 March\n1979 and Saturn on 12 November 1980, before making a closer investigation\nof Titan. Voyager-2 was the subject of a remarkable round of gravitational\nbilliards: launched on 20 August 1977, it overflew Jupiter on 9 July 1979,\nSaturn on 26 August 1981, Uranus on 24 January 1986, and Neptune on 24\nAugust 1989, sending back many photos of great quality. These four probes,\nPioneer-10 and -11, Voyager-1 and 2, are currently on their way out of the\nSolar System.\n\n15Launched on 9 May 2003, the probe arrived in the vicinity of Itokawa on 12 September\n2005 and flew close to the asteroid for some 2 years, coming near enough to take samples.\nOn 18 October 2007, it left for the Earth, arriving on 13 June 2010. Before burning up in\nthe atmosphere, the probe released a capsule which was recovered in the Australian desert.\nOn 16 November 2010, the Japanese space agency JAXA announced that the samples they\nobtained were of extra-terrestrial origin.\n\n16Itokawa is an asteroid belonging to the Apollo family, which crosses the orbit of Mars. It\nwas discovered by Linear on 26 September 1998. It looks like a bent cylinder with diameter\n200m and length 500m.\n\n\n\n16.1 Planets of the Solar System 811\n\nThe probe Galileo, launched17 in 1989, was placed in orbit around Jupiter\nin December 1995 to study the giant planet and its four large Galilean\nmoons.18 Although originally programmed to last 2 years, the mission of the\nGalileo orbiter actually went on for 8 years. The mission discovered the winds\nand storms on Jupiter, volcanic activity on Io, possible oceans under the sur-\nfaces of Europa and Callisto, and the magnetic field of Ganymede. When the\nfuel reserves (hydrazine) had almost run out, the probe was sent into Jupiter\nto remove all risk of collision with Europa, which might have contaminated it\nwith elements of terrestrial life. On the way from the Earth to Jupiter, Galileo\nphotographed several asteroids. And on the way from the Earth to Pluto, the\nprobe New Horizons, discussed below, tested its instruments by photograph-\ning Jupiter and its moons (see Fig. 16.1).\n\nSaturn. The US probe Cassini19 was launched on 15 October 1997 to study\nthe Saturn system. Using four gravity-assist maneuvers,20 it went into orbit\naround Saturn on 1 July 2004. On 25 December 2004, the European module\nHuygens21 separated from Cassini, and 3 weeks later, on 14 January 2005,\nmade a spectacular descent on Titan with the help of a parachute. Originally,\n\n17The VEEGA trajectory is a Venus\u2013Earth\u2013Earth gravity assist. We give the date (year\nmonth day) for each planet overflown: launch 1989 10 18, by the Atlantis shuttle STS-34.\nVenus flyby: 1990 02 10. Earth flyby 1: 1990 12 08. Earth flyby 2: 1992 12 08. Jupiter Orbit\nInsertion (JOI): 1995 12 07.\n\n18These four natural satellites were discovered in 1610 by Galileo, an event which had\nimportant scientific and philosophical consequences. He first gave them the Latin name\nMedicea sidera, which can be translated as \u201cMedician stars,\u201d in homage to the Medici family,\nthe Grand Dukes of Tuscany. Already a leader in many fields, Galileo was also skilled in the\nexercise of getting himself sponsorship! However, the appellation was eventually dropped.\nThe four moons were named later by other astronomers, after the four beautiful conquests\nof Zeus, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. But spot the boy! Note: solution below.\n\n19It was named after Giovanni Domenico Cassini (see the note on Cassini I), who discov-\nered the four natural satellites of Saturn between 1671 and 1684, and the separation between\nrings A and B, which is known as the Cassini division. Concerning the rings, Galileo had ob-\nserved in 1610 that Saturn appeared to have two \u201cears,\u201d which he considered to be moons.\nHowever, a few years later, they were no longer visible to him. Huygens realised that they\nwere looking at a ring, which was visible at various inclinations. But it was Cassini who first\nsaw two concentric rings A and B. Other rings were subsequently discovered, and they are\ncurrently labelled with letters up to G. Cassini put forward the hypothesis, since confirmed,\nthat the rings were made up of a multitude of small bodies gravitating on very close orbits.\n\n20The VVEJGA trajectory is a Venus\u2013Venus\u2013Earth\u2013Jupiter gravity assist. For each\nplanet overflown, we give the date (year month day) and the speeds in km/s in the form\n[before, after]. Speeds are given in a heliocentric frame: Launch: 1997 10 15. Venus flyby:\n1998 04 26 [37.2, 40.9]. Venus flyby: 1999 06 24 [39.2, 42.3]. Earth flyby: 1999 08 18 [35.0,\n39.1]. Jupiter flyby: 2000 12 30 [11.6, 13.7]. Saturn orbit insertion (SOI): 2004 07 01.\n\n21Christiaan Huygens (1629\u20131695) was a Dutch physicist, mathematician, and as-\ntronomer. In addition to his great treatises on probability, dynamics (definition of the\ncentrifugal force), mechanics, e.g., Horologium oscillatorium (1673), optics, e.g., Treatise\non Light (1690), he also wrote fundamental works on astronomy. By eliminating chro-\nmatic aberration, he improved the refracting telescope (Huygen\u2019s eyepiece), and with this\nenhancement, made fundamental discoveries in astronomy. For example, he discovered Sat-\nurn\u2019s moon Titan and the rings, as well as the rotation of Mars.\n\n\n\n812 Chapter 16. Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nCassini\u2019s mission was to consist in 74 revolutions around Saturn over 4 years,\nwith 52 close encounters with the various moons of Saturn and 45 Titan flybys\n(see Fig. 16.2). Given the success of this mission, NASA has extended it until\n2017. See the mission programme in Fig. 16.25 (upper).\n\nTrans-Neptunian Objects and Comets\n\nThe US probe New Horizons was launched in January 2006 to explore\nPluto and the Kuiper Belt,22 aiming to fly past Pluto in July 2015.\n\nHalley\u2019s comet, the most famous of all comets, was approached by six\nprobes in March 1986: ISEE-3 renamed ICE for this mission, Vega-1 and -2\n(Soviet probes, Ve for Venera, Ga for Galleia, \u201cVenus\u201d and \u201cHalley\u201d in Rus-\nsian), Giotto (a European probe23 which flew by at just 600km from the\ncometary nucleus), and Sakigake and Suisei (Japanese probes, whose names\nmean \u201cscout\u201d and \u201ccomet\u201d in Japanese) (Fig. 16.3).\n\nThe Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR) probe, launched on 3 July 2002,\nceased to function shortly afterwards. It was to investigate short-period comets\nlike P/Encke, whose orbit never goes beyond the orbit of Jupiter.\n\nRosetta24 is an ESA Cornerstone Mission. The probe was launched on 2\nMarch 2004 and must follow a complex route,25 going into orbit around the\ncomet26 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko in May 2014. In November 2014, the\nPhilae module should softland on the cometary nucleus and travel with it\nuntil it reaches its perihelion in December 2015.\n\nInvited to France by Colbert in 1665, he was one of the founders of the French Academy\nof Sciences. However, after 20 years in Paris, he returned to the Hague, sickened by the\nintolerance shown by Catholics toward Protestants. He himself had a \u201cmechanistic\u201d view\nof the Universe, rejecting the existence of gods and the supposed immortality of the soul:\n\u201cI believe that two plus two makes four.\u201d\n\n22So as not to spend too long over its tremendous journey, the probe was given a very fast\nsend-off. Just 9 h after launch on 19 January 2006, it was already in orbit around the Moon.\nIt flew past Jupiter on 28 February 2007, only a little more than a year after its departure.\nThis was a Jovian gravity-assist (JGA) trajectory. It should encounter Pluto on 14 July\n2015, at 11:47 UT, flying at an altitude of 13,695 km, and with a speed of 13.78 km/s, then\nCharon at 12:01 UT. Subsequently, New Horizons will explore at least one planetoid in the\nKuiper Belt. This mission replaces the Pluto\u2013Kuiper Express, abandoned in 2000.\n\n23In his painting The Adoration of the Magi, of 1304, the Italian artist Giotto represented\na huge comet. This might well be Halley\u2019s comet, which went by in 1301.\n\n24The Rosetta stone carries an inscription in three languages, used by Champollion to\ndecipher the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt in 1822. Rosetta is the English name of a village\nin the Nile Delta with the Arab name Rachid. This was where the stone was found. The\nESA chose this name for its Cornerstone Mission because it hopes the results of this mission\nwill enlighten us about the formation of the Solar System.\n\n25There have been several gravity-assist maneuvers: Earth (March 2005), Mars (March\n2007), Earth (November 2007), and Earth (November 2009).\n\n26The launch was initially planned for January 2003, so that Rosetta could meet up with\ncomet 46P/Wirtanen 10 years later.\n\n\n\n16.1 Planets of the Solar System 813\n\nFig. 16.1 : Images acquired by the probe New Horizons on the way to Pluto.

Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nNASA\u2019s Stardust and Genesis missions were in situ explorations with sam-\nple return.27\n\nNASA\u2019s Deep Impact mission was launched toward comet 9P/Tempel on\n12 January 2005, arriving on 4 July 2005. The probe released an impactor\nto produce a crater on the comet, causing it to throw out some of its in-\nner material. The impact was observed by the probe itself and by ground-\nbased observatories. Renamed Epoxi, the probe was then redirected to comet\n103P/Hartley 2, flying past on 4 November 2010.\n\n16.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities\n\nfor Planets\n\n16.2.1 Geodetic and Astronomical Data\n\nTable 16.2a gives the two basic quantities associated with each planet, its\nconstant of central attraction ? and its equatorial radius R, which allow one\nto calculate the following quantities:\n\n\u2022 The acceleration due to gravity g0 on the surface of the planet, from (6.6).\n\u2022 The escape velocity Ve, from (4.34).\n\u2022 The period T0(h=0) of a satellite in circular Keplerian orbit at zero altitude,\n\nfrom (5.6), to which we shall return shortly.\n\u2022 The density d, that is, the mass per unit volume of the body relative to\n\nthat of water (?water = 10\n3 kgm?3, density dwater = 1).\n\nTable 16.2b gives basic astronomical quantities concerning the orbit of the\nplanet around the Sun, including the semi-major axis aS and the sidereal\nperiod Nsid.\n\nIgnoring perturbations, Kepler\u2019s third law takes the very simple form\n\n[\nNsid (yr)\n\n]2\n=\n[\naS (a.u.)\n\n]3\n, (16.1)\n\nwith the chosen units.\n\n27Stardust was launched on 7 February 1999 and collected interstellar dust in 2002, then\nparticles from comet Wild-2 on 2 January 2004, before returning a capsule to the Utah\ndesert on 15 January 2006. Its heliocentric orbit took it out beyond the orbit of Mars.\nGenesis collected particles from the solar wind. This probe was launched on 8 August 2001,\nwith Lissajous orbit insertion (LOI) on 16 November 2001, remaining for more than 2 years\nat the Lagrange point L1 (halo orbit). From 3 December 2001 to 1 April 2004, it exposed\nits collectors to the solar wind to pick up particles from the Sun. It then started back to\nEarth by means of an astonishing loop-the-loop orbit, arriving as planned above the Utah\ndesert on 10 September 2004. Everything worked exactly as planned until a few seconds\nbefore landing: the parachutes were installed upside-down and the capsule crashed into the\nsand. However, part of its sample was recovered without contamination. Its highly original\norbit is described in Chap. 6 in the discussion of Lagrange points (see Table 6.9).\n\n\n\n16.2 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities for Planets 817\n\nWe have also calculated the radius ?? of the sphere of influence and in-\ndicated the characteristics of the planetary orbit, i.e., e, i, and ?, quantities\nwhich are not directly necessary in this study, but which allow one to compare\nthe orbits of different planets. For example, we see that the orbit of Pluto is\nhighly eccentric and that the rotation of Venus is retrograde (? > 90?), etc.\n\nTo study the true motion and characterise special orbits, we use the geode-\ntic and astronomical quantities given in Table 16.2c and d. The masses of the\nplanets are usually expressed by the ratio of the mass of the Sun to the mass\nof the planet (see Table 16.3).\n\nDifferent Radii of the Ellipsoid for the Giant Planets\n\nFor each giant planet, the ranges of variation from the equator to the pole,\nfor the different radii of the ellipsoid, are given in Table 16.4. Figure 16.4 shows\nthe radii of the ellipsoid at different latitudes, for Jupiter and Saturn, as we\ndid for the Earth ellipsoid in Chap. 2 (see Fig. 2.3) and the Mars ellipsoid in\nChap. 15 (see Fig. 15.4).\n\n16.2.2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nAs already discussed, when a satellite is in orbit (semi-major axis a) around\na planet, the period T0 of its Keplerian motion is given by (5.5). We can also\ncalculate the period T0(h=0) of a fictitious satellite at zero altitude. Considering\nthe mean mass per unit volume ? of the planet, we have ? = ?oV G, where V\nis the volume of the planet, assumed spherical. Using (5.6), we then obtain\n\nT0(h=0) =\n\n?\n3?\n\nG\n\n1\n?\n?o\n\n= 3.7584\u00d7 105??1/2o . (16.2)\n\nThis shows that the Keplerian period T0(h=0) can be expressed solely in terms\nof the mean density of the attractive body. As the Earth is the densest planet\nin the Solar System, the period T0(h=0) is the shortest. Conversely, the longest\nperiod is for a satellite orbiting around Saturn.\n\nUsing the mean density d relative to water and expressing the period in\nminutes, we obtain\n\nT0(h=0) (min) ? 198d?1/2 . (16.3)\n\nThe Keplerian period for a semi-major axis a can then be written\n\nT0(?) (min) ? 198\n?\n\n?3\n\nd\n, (16.4)\n\nfor reduced distance ? = a/R. Figure 16.5 graphs the dependence of T0/T0(h=0)\non ? = a/R.\n\n\n\n818 Chapter 16.

The mappable area, calculated on the\nellipsoid and expressed in millions of km2, has the following value for each\n\n\n\n822 Chapter 16. Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nplanet: 75 for Mercury, 460 for Venus, 510 for the Earth (140 for the land\nmasses and 370 for the sea floor), and 143 for Mars. For these four planets,\nthis makes a total of 1,188. We also have 18 for Pluto and 2.6 for the largest\nof the asteroids (and 0.001125 for 433-Eros). We shall discuss maps of natural\nsatellites shortly.\n\nThe geography of Mars (volcanoes, impact basins, etc.) was outlined in\nthe last chapter. We shall not dwell further here on the geography of Venus\nor the other telluric planets.\n\nIn this chapter, we shall use the following maps as background for repre-\nsenting ground tracks or orbits:\n\n\u2022 For Venus, the topographical map built up from synthetic aperture radar\n(SAR) data gathered by Magellan.\n\n\u2022 For Eros, the topographical map made from altimetry data gathered by\nNEAR.\n\nIn both cases, contours are plotted at 2 km intervals, with the zero altitude\ncontour in bold face. Those at positive altitudes are represented by continuous\ncurves and those at negative altitudes by dashed curves. For the planets, the\nzero meridian is chosen arbitrarily (see note on Airy for the Earth and Mars).\n\n16.3 Satellite of Planet in Real Orbit\n\n16.3.1 Perturbative Accelerations\n\nThe sphere of influence discussed in Sect. 6.11 informs us of the distance\nbeyond which one can no longer neglect perturbations due to the Sun. Equa-\ntion (6.158) gives the values of the radius ?? for all the planets. The results\nare displayed in Table 16.2b, where they can usefully be compared with the\nvalues in Table 16.2c.\n\nThe altitude dependence of the central acceleration and perturbative ac-\ncelerations has already been plotted for the Earth in Fig. 6.1 and for Mars in\nFig. 15.9. To complete the list of telluric planets, we have plotted the same\ngraphs for Mercury and Venus in Fig. 16.6, using the same notation as in\nTable 6.1 (in which, of course, we replace the terrestrial acceleration by the\nacceleration due to the relevant planet).\n\nFor these two planets, there is no perturbing acceleration due to the terms\nJn, n ? 3, since these terms are almost all zero. The very weak acceleration\n?CCN.J2 due to the term in J2 is soon supplanted (for h ? R) by the perturbing\nacceleration ?CS due to the solar attraction. For Mercury, the perturbing\nacceleration ?DP due to solar radiation pressure is still poorly known. For\nVenus, atmospheric drag causes an acceleration ?DF which can be very large,\nand depends on the altitude and shape of the satellite. The solar radiation\npressure, which leads to the perturbing acceleration denoted by ?DP, impinges\n\n\n\n16.3 Satellite of Planet in Real Orbit 823\n\nAltitude h (km)\n\nDistance r (1000 km)\n\nr/R\n\nA\ncc\n\nel\ner\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(m\n\n.s\n-2\n\n)\n\n10\n\n10-1\n\n10-3\n\n10-5\n\n10-7\n\n10-9\n\n10-11\n\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 14 16 18 20\n\n0 1000 10000\n\nslope\n\nA\ncc\n\nel\ner\n\nat\nio\n\nn \n(m\n\n.s\n-2\n\n)\n\nAltitude h (km)\n\nDistance r (1000 km)\n\nr/R\n\n5 6 7 8 9 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 100\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 12 14\n\n0 1000 10000\n\nslope\n10\n\n10-1\n\n10-3\n\n10-5\n\n10-7\n\n10-9\n\n10-11\n\nAtm.

Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\non the satellite both directly and indirectly, by the albedo effect, the mean\nalbedo of Venus being very high (0.76).\n\n16.3.2 Classification of Satellites\n\nRotational Motion of the Planets\n\nThe values given in Table 16.2a to d show that the two planets closest to\nthe Sun have very long periods of rotation: Dsid = 58.646 day for Mercury\n\n28\n\n(exactly 2/3 of the sidereal period of revolution) and Dsid = 243.018 day for\nVenus.29 For these two planets, the day is longer than the year. This is due\nto the proximity of the Sun.\n\nMoving further out to the Earth and Mars, this period Dsid is about 1\nday, while for the giant planets from Jupiter to Neptune, it is of the order of\n10 h.\n\nPlanetosynchronous Satellite\n\nFor satellites that are stationary with respect to the planet, we have used\n(7.69) to calculate the reduced altitude ?GS for a Keplerian orbit in terms of\nDsid. (For the Earth and Mars, the values were calculated for the Keplerian\nand then the true orbit, in Chaps. 7 and 15.) They are displayed in Table 16.2c.\n\nThe results prompt the following remarks:\n\n\u2022 For Mercury and Venus, the values of ?GS are so large that this orbit cannot\nbe obtained. The solar perturbative attraction becomes too great for these\naltitudes, and such an orbit would pass way beyond the sphere of influence\nof the planet.\n\n\u2022 For the Earth and Mars, ?GS is about 6.\n\u2022 For the giant planets, ?GS is about 2 or 3.\n\n28According to astronomers, the proximity of the Sun should have led to a 1:1 resonance\nphenomenon for Mercury, so that it would always present the same face towards the Sun,\nlike the natural satellites and their planets. This was indeed what was thought up until 1965,\nwhen radar measurements from the Earth showed that it had a shorter rotation period, of\nonly 59 days. The Italian astrophysicist Guiseppe Colombo showed that this was a very rare\ncase of a 3:2 resonance, i.e., three rotations in two revolutions, due to the high eccentricity\nof Mercury\u2019s orbit.\n\n29Venus is the brightest celestial body as seen from Earth, apart from the Sun and the\nMoon. This is partly because it is surrounded by a very thick layer of cloud. The speed of\nrotation was only measured in 1962, with the advent of the radar. The clouds have a much\nfaster rotational motion, known as super-rotation. At an altitude of 70 km, the atmosphere\nmakes one round trip in 4 days, corresponding to winds at 100m/s, in the direction of\nrotation of the planet.\n\n\n\n16.3 Satellite of Planet in Real Orbit 825\n\n\u2022 For Pluto,30 the position of the stationary satellite is more complex, but\nfortunately there is no urgency to carry out such a calculation!\n\nSun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nTo satisfy the condition (7.95) for a Sun-synchronous orbit, one must have\na large J2 term if the planet is close to the Sun, since its sidereal period of\nrevolution is short. Conversely, a weak J2 term is required if the planet is\nremote from the Sun. Now as we have already seen, if the planet is close to\nthe Sun, e.g., Mercury, Venus, its rotation about its own axis is blocked and\nplanetary flattening is very low. This in turn implies that J2 will be low, or\nalmost zero. We conclude that Sun-synchronicity is impossible.\n\nIf a planet is far from the Sun, as in the case of the giant planets, its\nrapid rotation creates a significant flattening effect and J2 is consequently\nlarge. To counterbalance this effect, the orbit must have a very low value of\ncos i, indeed, practically zero. The orbit is therefore polar, to within a few\nhundredths of a degree. But we should ask what Sun-synchronicity means for\na satellite in orbit around Jupiter, a planet which takes 12 years to go round\nthe Sun, or around Neptune, which takes 165 years!\n\nFor the two intermediate planets, the Earth and Mars, this condition can\nbe satisfied. The results for kh, the constant of Sun-synchronicity, calculated\nusing (7.98), are given in Table 16.2d, where we have also displayed ?m, the\nvalue of the maximal reduced distance ?HSmax, obtained for i = 180\n\n?.\n\nFrozen Orbit\n\nIn Chap. 11, we saw that a satellite orbit could be frozen by taking ad-\nvantage of balancing effects between the various variations in the position of\nthe periastron, i.e., secular and long-period variations. The ratio J3/J2 arises\nwhen we calculate the frozen eccentricity. For a frozen orbit to be useful, the\nfrozen eccentricity eF, which is of the order of (1/2)J3/J2, must be less than\n0.01, for beyond this, differences in altitude become too great.\n\nThe J3 term is a zonal term (axial symmetry) expressing the effects of\nasymmetry between the northern and southern hemispheres. For Mercury and\nVenus, which are practically spherical, J3 is zero or very low. For the giant\nplanets, J3 is zero because the plasticity of these planets only generates even\nzonal coefficients J2n (symmetry relative to the equatorial plane, or north\u2013\nsouth symmetry).\n\nIt follows that the only two planets that can have a satellite in frozen orbit\nare the Earth and Mars. As regards Sun-synchronous frozen orbits, recall that\n\n30Pluto is accompanied by Charon, discovered on 2 July 1978 by J.W. Christy. This\nsatellite has such a large relative mass (1/6 of the mass of Pluto) that the Pluto\u2013Charon\nensemble can be considered rather as a double planet. The semi-major axis of Charon\u2019s\ncircular orbit is aP = 19,460 km, and it is interesting to note that this value is very close to\nthe value for the planetostationary orbit. We have in fact aP/aGS = 1.05.\n\n\n\n826 Chapter 16. Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nFig. 16.7 :Map of Mercury obtained by Messenger after 1 day in orbit. On Mercury,\n\na solar day (length of time from noon to noon), or Hermean day, is about 176 Earth\n\ndays long. And during its first Mercury solar day in orbit, the Messenger space-\n\ncraft imaged nearly the entire surface of the planet to generate a global monochrome\n\nmap at 250m/pixel resolution and a 1 km/pixel resolution color map. Map centered\n\nalong the planet\u2019s 75? east longitude meridian. Credit (image and caption): NASA,\nAPL/JHU (Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory), CIW (Carnegie\n\nInstitution of Washington).\n\nthe argument of the periastron, related to the sign of J3, is ?F = 90\n? for the\n\nEarth and ?F = 270\n? for Mars.\n\n16.4 Ground Track for a Satellite of a Planet\n\nThe ground track of a satellite over several revolutions is characterised by\nthe equatorial shift, which depends for the main part on the angular speed\nof rotation of the planet. For the Earth or Mars, the equatorial shift is of\nthe order of 25? for a low-orbiting satellite. For the giant planets, it is two\nto three times greater. But for Mercury and Venus, which rotate very slowly\nabout their axes, the equatorial shift is very slight.\n\nWe shall now discuss in a little more detail the ground tracks of satellites\nin orbit around Mercury, Venus, and the asteroids Eros, Vesta, and Ceres\n(Fig. 16.7).\n\n\n\n16.4 Ground Track for a Satellite of a Planet 827\n\n16.4.1 Satellites of Mercury\n\nMercury has only been visited by two probes, Mariner-10 and Messenger.\nThere is also a project called BepiColombo. The abbreviated name of the US\nMercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging probe, or\nMessenger, makes reference to the main function of the mythological character\nMercury, or Hermes. It was launched in 2004 with no fewer than six gravity-\nassist maneuvers,31 and went into a highly eccentric near-polar orbit in 2011.\nIn phase 1, with a = 10,136km, i = 82.5?, the periastron was positioned at\na latitude of 60?N, in order to focus attention on the Caloris impact basis.\nThe period was 12 h (see Fig. 16.8 upper). The northernmost point ? = 82.5?\n\nwas overflown at an altitude between 244 and 640 km. The mission lasted\n12 months, i.e., two Mercurian solar days. In phase 2, with a = 7,736km,\ni = 82.5?, the period was reduced to 8 h, and the northernmost point was\noverflown at an altitude between 311 and 442 km (see Fig. 16.9).\n\nNote that, for a point on Mercury, the day, i.e., the time elapsed between\ntwo noontime passages of the Sun, lasts 176 Earth days. This means that 88\ndays of night will follow 88 days of daylight. This 176 days corresponds to two\nrevolutions around the Sun. So one Hermean (or Mercurian) day is equal to\ntwo Hermean years. This is a consequence of the 3:2 resonance, which means\nthat Mercury does three rotations (relative to an ECI frame, corresponding\nto 3 Hermean sidereal days) during two revolutions (or 2 Hermean years).\nApplying (8.44), we obtain the synodic period, which is the Hermean day.\n\nIn December 2012, the Messenger team built up the first complete map of\nMercury, with a definition of 250m/pixel. This map, shown in Fig. 16.7, was\nobtained after one (Hermean) day in orbit.\n\nBepiColombo is a joint mission32 between Europe and Japan, and should\nbe launched in August 2014 to arrive at its destination in December 2020,\nafter five gravity-assist maneuvers (Earth, Venus twice, and Mercury twice).\nThe probe comprises two orbiters: the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) run\nby the ESA and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO) run by JAXA,\nboth planned to follow highly eccentric polar orbits (i = 90?), with perigee\nat altitude hp = 400 km. The altitude of the apogee will be ha = 1,500km\nfor MPO and ha = 12,000km for MMO, so that the period of the latter, viz.,\nT = 560min, will be a multiple of the period of the former, viz., T = 140min\n(see Fig. 16.8 lower).\n\n31Launched 2004 07 30, Earth flyby (altitude 2,295 km) 2005 07 29, Venus flyby 1 (altitude\n3,000 km) 2006 10 23, Venus flyby 2 (altitude 300 km) 2006 10 23, Mercury flyby 1 (altitude\n200 km) 2008 01 14, Mercury flyby 2 (altitude 200 km) 2008 10 06, Mercury flyby 3 (altitude\n200 km) 2009 09 29, Mercury orbit insertion 2011 03 18.\n\n32There were originally two separate projects: the Japanese probe Mercury Orbiter and\nthe European probe BepiColombo Mercury Orbiter, named after the Italian mathematician\nGuiseppe \u201cBepi\u201d Colombo (1920\u20131984), mentioned earlier.

Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nFig. 16.10 :Part of Venus (Imdr region) viewed by Magellan\u2019s radar during three con-\n\nsecutive cycles (March 1991, November 1991, July 1992). Size: 400 km by 100 km,\n\ncentered on 47.5?S, 226.0?E. This set of three Magellan images shows a small vol-\ncano. Data quality during portions of cycle 3 was adversely affected by a faulty\n\ntransmitter aboard the spacecraft, leading to the missing strips in the bottom image.\n\nCredit (image and caption): JPL, NASA.\n\n16.4.2 Satellites of Venus\n\nThe probe Magellan, named after the sixteenth century Portuguese ex-\nplorer, was in orbit around Venus from 1990 to 1994. During this time it\nperfectly accomplished all its missions, the main task being to map the planet\n(achieved to 98%).\n\nThis radar mapping mission consisted of three cycles, each lasting 243\ndays, during which the Magellan satellite followed an eccentric polar orbit,\nshown in Fig. 16.14 (upper) with characteristics:\n\nhp = 289.57 km , ha = 8,458.5 km , i = 85.5\n? , ? = 170? ,\n\na = 10,425.8 km , e = 0.39176 , Ta = 195.59min = 3.26 h .\n\nThe ground track of this orbit has been shown over one revolution in\nFigs. 16.12 and 16.14. The radar mapping only proceeded for 37.2min during\neach revolution, from slightly before to slightly after the passage at perigee.\n\nThe length of the cycle of 243 days corresponds to Dsid, one Venusian\nsidereal day, the time the planet takes in a Galilean frame to make a complete\n\n\n\n16.4 Ground Track for a Satellite of a Planet 831\n\nround trip relative to the orbit of the satellite, which remains fixed in this\nframe. Indeed, Venus is almost perfectly spherical (J2 = 4.4098\u00d710?6, a very\nlow value) and the orbit of the satellite is near-polar, so precessional motions\nare almost non-existent. For the orbit defined above, we obtain\n\n?? = ?6\u00d7 10?4 deg/day , ?? = ?4\u00d7 10?3 deg/day .\n\nThe three images of the same region shown in Fig. 16.10 were acquired at\n8 month intervals, corresponding to the length of the cycle (one Venusian\nsidereal day), in March 1991, November 1991, and July 1992.\n\nFollowing the mapping cycles, the satellite was placed in a circular orbit\nby aerobraking, with h = 250km, to carry out geodetic studies. It was then\nsacrificed in a final experiment, known as the windmill experiment. For one\nand a half months, the solar panels were deployed to transform the satellite\ninto a sort of windmill, transmitting back the parameters of the atmosphere\nwhich finally consumed it.\n\nMagellan produced a very accurate map of the planet (see Figs. 16.13\nand 16.11). The gravitational potential model of degree and order 21, known as\nthe JPL Venus Gravity Model (JPL-VGM1B), obtained using Doppler radio\ntracking data from Pioneer Venus Orbiter, has evolved to degree and order 90\nthanks to data gathered by Magellan, to give the model MGNP90 (Magellan\n+ PVO, 90th degree and order) (Figs. 16.12, 16.13, and 16.14).33\n\nThe European probe Venus Express, carrying the same type of instruments\nas Mars Express, was launched on 9 November 2005. After a 153 day direct\ntrip, it arrived on 11 April 2006 and went into its operational orbit on 18\nMay of the same year. Venus Express is in a highly eccentric polar orbit, with\na = 39,176km, e = 0.839 (hp = 250km, ha = 66,000km, T = 1,425min), and\nperiastron at latitude 70?N (see Fig. 16.15 upper). This orbit, almost fixed\nrelative to the planet (as happens for all Venusian satellites), will study the\natmosphere, which for its part makes a round trip of the planet every 4 days.\n\nThe Japanese probe Planet-C (Venus Climate Orbiter or VCO), renamed\nAkatsuki (\u201cdawn\u201d), was launched on 21 May 2010. An engine problem as it\napproached Venus on 7 December 2010 prevented it from entering the correct\norbit. The Japanese space agency JAXA hold out a slim hope of correcting\nthe error. The planned orbit was highly eccentric and almost equatorial:\n\na = 45,500 km , e = 0.8604 , i = 172? ,\n\nwhence hp = 300km and ha = 78,600 km (see Fig. 16.15 lower).\n\n33Planetocentric gravitational constant ?, in km3 s?2:\n? = 324,858.60 \u00b1 0.05 for JPL-VGM1B (1990) ,\n? = 324,858.601 \u00b1 0.014 for MGNP90 (1997) .\n\n\n\n832 Chapter 16.

The ground track of the orbit over one Earth day in Fig. 16.12 exhibits\nno obvious asymmetry, as is often the case for eccentric terrestrial orbits.\nThis is due to the fact that the planet is almost motionless (compared with\nthe satellite motion, even at apoastron) in a Galilean frame. The very slow\nrotation of the planet about its axis gives a very small equatorial shift of\nabout 0.20?, i.e., about 21 km between two consecutive ground tracks, as can\nbe seen from Fig. 16.14 (lower), for a time lapse of 5 days. In the latter, the\nMercator projection used for the map is centered on Maxwell Montes. This\ngreat mountain range in Ishtar Terra, the highest in Venus, is 11 km above\nthe mean level of the planet. ?\n\n16.4.3 Satellites of the Asteroid Eros\n\nThe asteroid 433-Eros, made of siliceous rock, has a rather cylindrical\nshape.34 From 14 February 2000, the probe NEAR, since renamed NEAR-\nShoemaker, went into orbit to become a satellite of Eros.

The NRL190 model uses spherical harmon-\nics. However, when the body under investigation is so far from spherical, the gravitational\npotential can be expanded in terms of ellipsoidal harmonics, where the Legendre functions\nare replaced by the Lame? functions.\n\n\n\n838 Chapter 16.

Dawn was launched on 27 September 2007 and flew past Mars\non 17 February 2009 to arrive at Vesta on 21 July 2011. For a year until 25\nJuly 2012, Dawn exploited three successive orbits around Vesta: a survey orbit\n(SO), a high altitude mapping orbit (HAMO), and a low altitude mapping or-\nbit (LAMO). Increasing its altitude to prepare for departure, Dawn remained\nfor a certain time in the HAMO2 orbit, very close to HAMO. In September\n2012, the probe left to pursue its mission to Ceres, which it should finally\nreach on 1 February 2015. It will follow three orbits: SO, High, and Low, until\nthe end of its mission in July 2015. The orbital characteristics are indicated\nin Table 16.7.\n\nThe first part of the mission, i.e., exploration of Vesta, was extremely\nsuccessful.

The orbits considered are circular. When Dawn went in the HAMO orbit\nwith a = 867.287km, i.e., a ? Re = 591km, the nodal period was Td =\n641.04min, which corresponds to exactly twice Vesta\u2019s sidereal day Dsid =\n320.52min. Taking Vesta\u2019s sidereal day as time unit, the recurrence triple\nbecomes [1, 0, 2] 1, with the usual notation. This resonance gives an orbit\nwith a strikingly original graphical representation (see Fig. 16.20). Note that,\nfor satellites in orbit around a body as far from spherical as Vesta, with such\na large J2 term, the apsidal precession rate is very high. For Dawn/HAMO,\n?? = ?4.7? per day and the difference between Td and Ta = 637.36min is\nconsiderable.\n\nBy increasing the altitude from 591 to 680km, the period is multiplied by\na factor of 1.15 and the satellite thus takes 2.30 sidereal days to make one\nround trip, whence the shift in the ground tracks (see Fig. 16.21). ?\n\nExample 16.4 Orbits of Dawn around Ceres.\n\n? The H orbit of Dawn around Ceres is similar to the HAMO orbit for Vesta.\nThe probe takes less than 2 sidereal days to make one revolution (see Fig. 16.22\nupper). At the end of the mission, Dawn goes into a polar orbit called the\nL orbit at an altitude of 700 km.

Whereas a satellite around the Earth, Mars, or another telluric\nplanet will revolve for months on end on a virtually unchanging orbit, a probe\naround Jupiter or Saturn changes orbit upon each revolution. To fly past a\ngiven moon, the probe may go from a highly eccentric orbit to a circular one,\nmaking frequent use of its thrusters.\n\nJupiter\n\nAfter 8 years of mission, Galileo had made 34 orbits around Jupiter, each\nwith a period of several weeks.36 The Juno mission37 is designed to study the\norigin and evolution of Jupiter. Once in orbit,38 the probe should make 32\nrevolutions over 1 year. Later we shall mention the JUICE mission to Jupiter\nwhen discussing exploration of natural satellites.\n\nSaturn\n\nThe Cassini mission consisted of three main parts. The first, or Prime\nMission, from 17 May 2004 to 1 June 2008, made 74 revolutions. Arriving\nfrom the Earth, the probe flew past Phoebe on 11 June, before orbit insertion\n(SOI) on 1 July. It then made 3 Titan flybys, dropping the Huygens module\non 14 January 2005. The mission was subsequently devoted primarily to the\ndynamics of Saturn\u2019s atmosphere, occultation by the rings, and the icy moons.\n\nThe Extended Mission, up until 11 October 2010, revolution 139, and\nthe Extended Extended Mission up until 18 September 2017, revolution 292,\ncontinued to fly past Titan and all the other moons. The dates of these two\nmissions were determined by Saturn\u2019s declination. The Extended Mission,\nrenamed Equinox Mission, was centered around the equinox of 11 August\n2009, with ? = 0?, while the Extended Extended Mission, renamed Solstice\nMission, ended shortly after the solstice of 25 May 2017, with ? = 26.7? (see\n\n36Here are some examples with their denomination: G1, flying past Ganymede, 1996 06\n27, then G2, past Ganymede again, 1996 09 06, then C3, past Callisto, 1996 11 04, then\nE4, past Europa, 1996 12 19.

The shadow thrown by the rings on the planet\nduring the northern summer solstice is shown in Fig. 16.26.\n\nAs soon as it arrived near Saturn, Cassini detected a vertical motion of\nthe rings, as though they were being shaken by waves, shown in Fig. 16.3.\nSoon afterwards, other shots revealed small, hitherto unknown moons39 in\nthe rings, which produce these so-called density waves.\n\nThe Cassini mission made countless discoveries40 some of which we present\nhere with the help of the illustrations in Figs. 16.27 and 16.28:\n\n\u2022 The honeycomb structure of Hyperion, with a roughly cylindrical shape,\nabout 370 km long and 220km across.\n\n\u2022 The strange bulge of Iapetus (radius R = 747km), which is in fact a moun-\ntain range running strictly along the equator.41\n\n\u2022 The oversized crater on the surface of Mimas (R = 199km).\n\u2022 The tiger stripes of Enceladus (R = 252km), with their water vapour\n\ngeysers.42\n\nWe shall say more about Titan below.\n\n39The small natural satellite Daphnis, discovered by this probe in May 2005, has a diam-\neter of just 7 km. It revolves in the Keeler division, 42 km wide, inside ring A. The resulting\nwaves, either in the plane or perpendicular to them, can be made out in the small photo on\nthe left of Fig. 16.3. The motion in the vertical direction is particularly visible in the light\nat grazing incidence, at a date close to the Saturn equinox.\n\n40The moons mentioned here had been discovered long before: Hyperion (also called\nSaturn VII, or S VII) by C. and G. Bond and W. Lassel in 1848, Iapetus (S VIII) by\nJ.D. Cassini in 1671, and Mimas (S I) and Enceladus (S II) by W. Herschel in 1789. The\ncontribution of the Cassini probe was to provide precise images of each of these moons and\nto show how very different they are.\n\n41This mountain has a triangular cross-section with base 200 km and height 18 km.\n42After imaging these geysers, Cassini was programmed to make more frequent flybys\n\nof Enceladus. It was discovered that the water from the geysers was mixed with particles\nof ice and organic compounds. The temperature at the surface of Enceladus is only about\n75K, but higher in the crevices.\n\n\n\n16.4 Ground Track for a Satellite of a Planet 849\n\n[SATURN][SATURN]   Cassini Apr.2017\nOrbit - ref.: Saturn\n>>>>   Time span shown:   150.0 min =   0.10 day\n\nEquiv. altit.  =   582478 km\n\ne = 0.900823\n\na = 642808.0 km\n\nCRITICAL Inclin. =  64.00 \u00b0\n\nPeriod =  8769.94 min    * rev/day = 0.16\n\nh_a =1161534 km;  h_p = 3422 km;  arg.periapsis:   +0.00 \u00b0\n\nA.N.:  62.00 \u00b0Projection:  Orthographic\nProperty:   none\n\nT.:Azimuthal - Graticule: 10\u00b0\n\nProject. centre: 22.0 \u00b0 S;   20.0 \u00b0 W\nAspect:  Oblique\n\n[ -90.0/+112.0/+110.0] [ +15] IAU91\n\nFig. 16.26 :Cassini\u2019s trajectory at the end of its mission in April 2017, at the summer\n\nsolstice.

Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nB \u2013 Satellite of a Natural Satellite\n\n16.5 Natural Satellites in the Solar System\n\n16.5.1 Presentation of the Natural Satellites\n\nIn previous chapters, we have discussed the natural satellites of the telluric\nplanets. As far as the giant planets are concerned, the number of known\nnatural satellites literally exploded after 1980, with the contributions of the\nVoyager missions and the progress made with adaptive optics on Earth-based\ntelescopes. Before this date, we knew of 13 moons for Jupiter, 11 for Saturn,\n5 for Uranus, and 2 for Neptune.\n\nToday, the numbers have swollen considerably. Natural satellites are clas-\nsified into regular and irregular. A moon is regular if it moves in the same\ndirection as the rotation of the planet on a near-circular orbit in the equatorial\nplane of the planet. Otherwise it is irregular.44 In 2013, we know of 67 moons\n(8 regular) for Jupiter, 62 (21 regular) for Saturn, 27 (18 regular) for Uranus,\nand 13 (6 regular) for Neptune. Concerning Pluto, it gravitates in a binary\nsystem with Charon, which has 1/6 of its mass.\n\nClearly, all the newly discovered moons are much smaller. Some measure\nonly a few tens of kilometers across. As a rule, if a satellite has diameter\ngreater than 400km, it is rather spherical. If not, it becomes less and less\nspherical as the size diminishes.\n\nFor all natural satellites, the inclination is specified relative to the equa-\ntorial plane of the planet. There is one exception, and an important one: our\nown natural satellite. For the Moon does not gravitate in the equatorial plane\nof the Earth.45 In this sense, it should be classified with the irregular natural\nsatellites.\n\nThe natural satellites have one very important characteristic: they all ex-\nhibit synchronous rotation, or 1:1 resonance, i.e., one rotation during one\nrevolution around the planet.46 They are practically fixed relative to an axis\n\n44It is thought that the regular satellites were formed at the same time as their host\nplanet. The irregulars would then have a quite different history. A satellite like Nereid\nwith its highly eccentric orbit around Neptune (e = 0.75, i = 7?) suggests that some\nirregular moons are probably former asteroids, or trans-Neptunian objects, captured by the\ngravitational attraction of the host planet.\n\n45The Moon has a very complex motion since it is part of a three-body system, comprising\nthe Moon, the Earth, and the Sun (?/?N = 81.30059). The Moon\u2019s eccentric orbit makes\nan angle of 5.2? with the ecliptic. The inclination of the lunar orbit with respect to the\nEarth equatorial plane thus varies between 18.3? and 28.6? (see the note on Delaunay).\n\n46The only exceptions are two satellites of Saturn, beyond Titan. The most distant,\nPhoebe, has a retrograde orbit and non-synchronous rotation. The other, Hyperion, trapped\nbetween the orbits of Titan and Iapetus, exhibits chaotic rotation.\n\n\n\n16.6 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities for Natural Satellites 853\n\npassing through their center of gravity and the center of the host planet.\nLike the Moon for the Earth, they always turn the same face towards their\nplanet. This is due to the tidal effect.47\n\n16.5.2 Space Exploration of Natural Satellites\n\nIf we exclude the lunar conquest, discussed at the beginning of the chapter\nin the more general context of space exploration, there was no specific mission\nto any of the natural satellites at the beginning of the space age. If a visit was\norganised, it was always part of a trip to the associated planet.\n\nThis situation has changed since the Galileo mission, which made funda-\nmental discoveries about the Galilean moons of Jupiter. And the Cassini\u2013\nHuygens mission has spent more time observing the moons of Saturn than\nthe host planet itself. Future missions will reinforce this trend, whether to\nJupiter, with JUICE, or to Saturn, with TSSM.\n\n16.6 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities\n\nfor Natural Satellites\n\n16.6.1 Geodetic and Astronomical Data\n\nHere we examine several natural satellites in more detail:\n\n\u2022 The Moon, because it is our own moon, and has been visited so many\ntimes.\n\n\u2022 Europa, because it seems there may be liquid water there, and the three\nother Galilean moons of Jupiter.\n\n\u2022 Titan, with its atmosphere, and another satellite of Saturn, Enceladus.\n\u2022 Triton, satellite of Neptune, which has a thin atmosphere and enigmatic\n\ngeysers.\n\nTable 16.8 gives the geodetic and astronomical data for these bodies, together\nwith derived quantities.\n\nEven though it does not date from the time of their formation, the blockage\nof natural satellites so that they always turn the same face toward the host\nplanet is certainly very ancient. It leads to distortion of the moon, to varying\ndegrees. From an ellipsoid of revolution, it is transformed to a triaxial ellipsoid,\nfor which one can define an equatorial radiusRx along the axis toward the host\n\n47The planet exerts a tidal force on the natural satellite, much stronger than that exerted\nby the natural satellite on the planet. Viscous friction inside the natural satellite with its\nassociated dissipation of energy ends up by slowing down the rotation of the natural satellite.\nWhen the rotation becomes synchronous, the natural satellite has been derformed into a\nshape extended in the direction of the planet. This deformation of the Moon in the direction\nof the Earth is very slight, while that of Phobos towards Mars is enormous, relative to the\nsize of this moon. As soon as the natural satellite finds itself in this 1:1 resonance, it remains\ntrapped in that situation by the restoring couple exerted by the planet.\n\n\n\n854 Chapter 16.

The inclination i is\n\ntaken relative to the plane of the ecliptic (ECL) or the equatorial plane of the planet\n\n(EQU). The rotation of the natural satellite is synchronous: Dsid = Nsid. For Triton,\n\nthe orbit is retrograde (minus sign).\n\n\n\n16.6 Geodetic and Astronomical Quantities for Natural Satellites 855\n\nplanet, anotherRy orthogonal to it, and a polar radiusRz, each measured from\nits center. To quantify this distortion of the volume and the mass distribution,\nwe use the harmonic coefficients C20 and C22, which involve the moments of\ninertia Ix, Iy , and Iz, as discussed in Chap. 3. Recall from Table 3.1:\n\nC20 =\n1\n\n2MR2\n(Ix + Iy ? 2Iz) , C22 =\n\n1\n\n4MR2\n(Iy ? Ix) , (16.5)\n\nwhere M is the total mass and R = Rx.\nFor a planet, we have seen that C20 (with the notation J2 = ?C20) de-\n\nscribes the flattening and C22 is zero, or almost zero. For a natural satellite,\nC22 is less than C20 but of the same order of magnitude. For a body in hydro-\nstatic equilibrium, i.e., gravitational and pressure forces are balanced, it can\nbe shown that ????C20C22\n\n???? = 103 . (16.6)\nChanges in the trajectory and velocity of probes during flyby can be used to\ndetermine these coefficients.\n\n16.6.2 Satellite in Keplerian Orbit\n\nProvided its altitude is not too great, in a sense to be defined later, every-\nthing happens for the satellite in orbit (semi-major axis a) around a natural\nsatellite as if it feels only the attraction of this body. Let ?N be the grav-\nitational constant of this natural satellite, and keep ? for the gravitational\nconstant of the corresponding planet. All the formulas derived for the Keple-\nrian orbit can be applied, replacing ? by ?N, as in (5.5).\n\nThe period of the satellite at altitude 0 is given by (5.6) or (16.3). For\nexample, for the Moon, with d = 3.34, we obtain for this period\n\nT0(h=0) =\n198?\n3.34\n\n= 108min .\n\nThe values of T0(h=0) are given in Table 16.8 for various natural satellites.\nFigure 16.5 graphs T0/T0(h=0) against a/R, where R is of course the radius\nof the natural satellite.\n\n16.6.3 Geographical Maps\n\nNatural satellites of planets can be mapped. The mappable area in millions\nof km2 is indicated in Table 16.8. The total area of the natural satellites is 425,\nincluding 232 for Jupiter\u2019s four Galilean moons. In this chapter, we shall use\nthe following maps as background to represent the ground track or orbit:\n\n\u2022 For the Moon, the topographical map based on laser altimeter data gath-\nered by Clementine. Contours are plotted in 2 km steps, with the same\nconvention for the curves as we used for planetary maps.\n\n\n\n856 Chapter 16. Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\n\u2022 For Europa, we shall not use a map, which would be difficult to read, but\nseveral images compiled by Galileo, showing the rather unusual structure\nof the surface.\n\nWe shall not dwell upon the geography of these celestial bodies. Since the first\nobservations of mountains by Galileo, the geography and geology of the Moon\nhave been the subject of extremely detailed studies.\n\nIn the case of the natural satellites, the prime meridian is not chosen\narbitrarily. The origin for longitudes is taken to be the meridian exactly at\nthe center of the face turned toward the planet.\n\n16.7 Satellite of a Natural Satellite\n\nin Real Orbit\n\n16.7.1 Perturbative Accelerations\n\nFor a satellite in orbit around a natural satellite, the sphere of influence\nidentifies the region in which the acceleration due to the mother planet is\nnegligible compared to the central acceleration. To evaluate this, we go back\nto the formulas in Sect. 6.11, replacing ?S by ? and ? by ?N, since for the\nsatellite, the planet/Sun system is now replaced by the natural satellite/planet\nsystem. Table 16.8 shows the ratios ?/?N and the results of the calculation\nof ??. We note that, for Europa, ?? is very small because its mass is 40,000\nless than the mass of Jupiter.\n\nThe dependence of the central accelerations and perturbative accelerations\non the altitude of the satellite is shown in Fig. 16.29 (upper) for a satellite\naround the Moon, and in Fig. 16.29 (lower) for a satellite around Europa. The\nnotation for the accelerations is adapted from Table 6.1.\n\nFor the central acceleration, (6.6) gives ?CCC(R) = g(R) = g0, which\nimplies a value of 1.62m s?2 for the Moon and 1.31m s?2 for Europa. The main\ndifference between the cases examined up to now, of satellites around planets,\nis clearly the presence (and magnitude) of the term ?CC1, the perturbing\nacceleration due to the central planet.\n\nFor a satellite of the Moon close to ground level, ?CCN.J2 is greater than\n?CC1 :\n\n?CCN.J2(R) = 32.8\u00d7 10?5ms?2 , ?CC1(R) = 2.5\u00d7 10?5ms?2 .\n\nHowever, above h ? 1,000km, ?CC1 soon exceeds ?CCN.J2. For a satellite of\nEuropa, ?CC1 is always greater than ?CCN.J2 :\n\n?CCN.J2(R) = 0.8\u00d7 10?3ms?2 , ?CC1(R) = 1.3\u00d7 10?3ms?2 .\n\nMoreover, this term ?CC1 increases with altitude (with slope p = 1 on a log\u2013\nlog scale), and when the satellite is at an altitude of about 10,000km, this\n\n\n\n16.7 Satellite of a Natural Satellite in Real Orbit 857\n\nacceleration due to Jupiter is greater than the central acceleration ?CCC due\nto Europa. In this case, ?CC1 can no longer be treated as a perturbation, just\nas the satellite is no longer a satellite of Europa!\n\nFigure 16.29 shows the central and perturbative accelerations for two other\nGalilean satellites of Jupiter, namely Ganymede and Callisto.\n\n16.7.2 Classification of Satellites\n\nMotion of Natural Satellites\n\nThe natural satellites studied here, like the others, all have synchronous\nrotation, i.e.,\n\nDsid = Nsid ,\n\nwhere the first term is the sidereal period of rotation of the natural satellite\nabout its own axis and the second is the sidereal period of revolution of the\nnatural satellite about the central planet. For the natural satellites considered\nhere, this period ranges from 27 days for the Moon to less than 4 days for Eu-\nropa, and slightly more than a day for Enceladus. It should be noted that the\nrevolution and hence the rotation of Triton occur in the retrograde direction\naround Neptune (Fig. 16.30).\n\nStationary Satellite\n\nIn the example below, we show that it is impossible to place a satellite in\nstationary orbit around a natural satellite.\n\nExample 16.5 Investigate the possibility of placing a satellite in a synchronous\norbit, and more specifically, in a stationary orbit, around a natural satellite.\n\n? A satellite S is in circular orbit with semi-major axis a around a natural\nsatellite N (with gravitational constant ?N), which is itself in orbit with semi-\nmajor axis aP around a planet P (with gravitational constant ?). If the orbit\nof S is synchronous with N, itself rotating in 1:1 resonance with P, Kepler\u2019s\nthird law gives the relation between the mean motions as\n\n?\n\na3P\n=\n\n?N\na3\n\n.\n\nThis in turn implies that\n\naGS = a =\n\n(\n?N\n?\n\n)1/3\naP , (16.7)\n\nwhere aGS is the semi-major axis of the stationary orbit.\nWe now compare this value with ?? , the radius of the sphere of influence.\n\nAdapting (6.158) to the present situation, we obtain\n\n\n\n858 Chapter 16.

(16.8)\n\nThe satellite must stay within the sphere of influence, i.e., it must satisfy the\ninequality\n\naGS < ?? . (16.9)\n\nHence, with the values obtained from (16.7) and (16.8),\n\n(\n?N\n?\n\n)5/3\n<\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(\n?N\n?\n\n)2\n.\n\nFinally,\n\n?N > 8? . (16.10)\n\nBut this condition is obviously absurd. A natural satellite cannot have greater\nmass than the central planet. It is thus impossible to obtain a stationary orbit\nfor a satellite of a natural satellite.48 ?\n\nSun-Synchronous Satellite\n\nWe now study the case of a satellite in Sun-synchronous orbit around\na natural satellite. We can calculate the constant of Syn-synchronicity using\n(7.98). We can also find a relation between khN and khP, the Sun-synchronicity\nconstants for satellites in orbit around a natural satellite N and around the\ncentral planet P, respectively. With the corresponding subscripts, we can write\n\nkhN =\n3\n\n2\n\nTsid\nT0(h=0)N\n\nJ2N , khP =\n3\n\n2\n\nTsid\nT0(h=0)P\n\nJ2P .\n\nIt is important to note that the sidereal period of revolution Tsid is the same\nin both cases: the natural satellite N takes the same time as the planet P to\naccomplish one revolution around the Sun. We obtain\n\nkhN\nkhP\n\n=\nJ2N\nJ2P\n\nT0(h=0)P\n\nT0(h=0)N\n. (16.11)\n\n48In a certain sense, the Lagrange points provide one way of having a stationary position.\nIf a satellite is stationary with respect to a natural satellite, it is also stationary with\nrespect to the planet, because of the synchronous rotation of the natural satellite. This\nhappens when it occupies one of the five Lagrange points. It then remains fixed relative\nto the natural satellite\u2013planet system. Only the positions L4 and L5 are stable. When\nthe satellite is located at L4 or L5, it forms an equilateral triangle with the planet and\nthe natural satellite. In the case of the Moon and Earth, the satellite is thus located some\n380,000 km from the natural satellite. Needless to say, this is not much use for an observation\nsatellite. The mission STARS, since abandoned in this form, was envisaged for the L5 point\nof the Earth\u2013Moon system, but the aim was not to observe the Moon.\n\n\n\n16.8 Ground Track of a Satellite of a Natural Satellite 861\n\nUsing (16.2) or (16.3) with the mean densities, we then have\n\nkhN\nkhP\n\n=\n\n?\ndN\ndP\n\nJ2N\nJ2P\n\n. (16.12)\n\nWe now return to the natural satellites investigated here. For the Moon\nand Europa, the reader is referred to Fig. 16.29, which indicates the different\naccelerations. For the Moon, the calculation of the Syn-synchronicity constant\nkh = khN using (16.12) yields\n\nkh = 1.4725 .\n\nThis in turn implies a minimal inclination of\n\niHSmin = 133\n? .\n\nFor a satellite in low orbit around the Moon (LLO, Lunar Low Orbiting), the\nperturbing acceleration ?CC1 due to the Earth is less than the perturbing ac-\nceleration ?CCN.J2 due to flattening. If the LLO satellite is in Sun-synchronous\norbit, the effect of the Earth, which is one tenth the effect due to the J2 term\nof the Moon, would soon remove the satellite from this Sun-synchronous orbit,\nin a matter of a few days.\n\nFor Europa, the situation is more radical. The term ?CC1 is always greater\nthan ?CCN.J2, even at zero altitude. The perturbation due to Jupiter\u2019s gravity\nis greater than the one due to the flattening of Europa, whatever the altitude\nof the satellite. There is therefore no hope of obtaining a Sun-synchronous\norbit for a satellite around Europa.\n\nFrozen Orbit\n\nOwing to a lack of accurate data concerning the natural satellites, we can\nonly investigate frozen orbits for satellites around the Moon. In the case of our\nown natural satellite, the spherical harmonic coefficients of the gravitational\npotential are well documented (see Table 16.9).\n\nFor a satellite in low near-polar orbit (with frozen perigee ?F = 270\n?\n\nsince J3 > 0), the frozen eccentricity eF can be approximately calculated\nusing (11.57), which gives eF ? 0.02. This is relatively high for a frozen\neccentricity. For other inclinations, eF can take values between 0.01 and 0.001.\nThese calculations are complicated by the presence of the J7 term, whose value\nis rather large here.\n\n16.8 Ground Track of a Satellite\n\nof a Natural Satellite\n\n16.8.1 Satellites of the Moon\n\nAfter the conquest of the Moon (1959\u20131972), discussed at the beginning\nof the chapter in the more general context of space exploration, followed by\n\n\n\n862 Chapter 16. Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nJ2 = 203.236626 J5 = 0.715409 J8 = ?9.674866\nJ3 = 8.475906 J6 = ?13.577715 J9 = 15.496033\nJ4 = ?9.591929 J7 = ?21.774733 J10 = 4.267023\n\nTable 16.9 :Values of the coefficients (Jn \u00d7 106) of the gravitational potential of the\nMoon in the LPLGM model.\n\nthe three Soviet Luna probes (1974\u20131976), no more probes and orbiters were\nsent to the Moon for almost two decades (Fig. 16.31 and 16.32).\n\nThe Deep Space Probe Science Experiment (DSPSE), known as Clemen-\ntine, launched on 25 January 1994, went into lunar orbit for 70 days and drew\nup a very accurate topographic map of the Moon. It had a highly eccentric\norbit with hp = 412km for the pericenter, or periselene, and ha = 2,940km\nfor the apocenter or aposelene. It then failed in its encounter with the asteroid\n1620-Geographos. The probe Lunar Prospector, launched on 7 January 1998,\nwent into a near-circular near-polar orbit with h = 100km, then h = 40 and\nh = 30km. It then deliberately impacted the Moon near the South Pole in a\ncontrolled crash to look for evidence of water ice, but none was found.\n\nLunar gravitational potential models first used laser ranging measurements\n(LLR, Lunar Laser Ranging) carried out by means of reflectors set up on\nthe Moon, then the satellites Lunar Orbiter-1 to -5, Apollo-15 and -16, and\nClementine for the models GLGM-1 and 2 (Goddard Lunar Gravity Model).\nThe model known as LPLGM (Lunar Prospector Lunar Gravity Model) also\nused Lunar Prospector (see Table 16.10).\n\nThe European probe SMART-1, launched on 27 September 2003, remained\nfor more than a year, until 2 November 2004, in orbit around the Earth. Then,\nfrom 15 November 2004, it revolved around the Moon until it was deliberately\ncrashed on 3 September 2006. The main aim was not so much to study the\nMoon as to test the newly developed ion drive technology.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, three Asian countries carried out successful missions\nto the Moon. The Japanese mission Selenological and Engineering Explorer\n(Selene), renamed Kaguya after the launch on 14 September 2007, comprises\na main satellite (h = 100km) and two auxiliary satellites, Okina (Rstar or\nRelay Sat, hp = 100km, ha = 2,400km) and Ouna (Vstar or V RAD Sat,\nhp = 100km, ha = 800km). The main satellite was then put in a very low\norbit with hp = 20km, ha = 50km, and subsequently projected onto the lunar\nsurface on 10 June 2009. All these orbits are polar, i.e., i = 90?. Japan had\nalready launched the satellite Hiten (Muses-A) in 1990.\n\nThe main aim of the Chinese missions Chang\u2019E (the name of a Chinese\nMoon god) was to map the Moon and prepare manned missions. Chang\u2019E-1,\nlaunched on 14 October 2007, went into a circular polar orbit with h = 200km,\ncrashing into the surface on 1 March 2009, and Chang\u2019E-2, launched on 1\nOctober 2010, went into a circular polar orbit with h = 100km, then an\nelliptical orbit with hp = 15km, ha = 100km.\n\n\n\n16.8 Ground Track of a Satellite of a Natural Satellite 863\n\nFig. 16.31 : Images of the hidden face of the Moon.

On 23 June, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter\n(LRO) went into circular polar orbit with h = 50km. The aims were mapping\nand improving the geodetic model (see Figs. 16.33 and 16.36). It carried seven\ninstruments, including the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE) to\n\n49This programme, launched in 2004 under G.W. Bush, was as ambitious as the Apollo\nprogramme at the time of J.F. Kennedy. The aim was to go to the Moon, and from there\nto Mars. However, this was revised under the Obama presidency. The lunar stage could be\ndropped and replaced by a manned visit to an asteroid. To be continued.\n\n\n\n16.8 Ground Track of a Satellite of a Natural Satellite 865\n\nmeasure the surface temperature. It identified certain places, such as craters,\nat the South Pole, that would not have seen sunlight for billions of years, just\nthe kind of places where water ice might be trapped. The surface temperature\nmap of the south polar region shown in Fig. 16.37 (upper) is witness to LRO\u2019s\nnear-polar orbit. The data were acquired from September to October 2009,\nwhen the temperatures in this region would have been at their maximum. The\ncrater chosen to receive the impact of the Lunar Crater Observation and Sens-\ning Satellite (LCROSS) is indicated with a white circle in the figure. It is one\nof the coldest points on the Moon (about 40K, or ?230 ?C). The 3D map of\nthe South Pole in Fig. 16.37 (lower), indicating temperatures, locates the point\nof impact of LCROSS,50 which occurred on 9 October 2009. Analysis of the\nparticles thrown up by the impact did indeed reveal the presence of water ice.\n\nThe Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission is the\nequivalent for the Moon of GRACE for the Earth, with two satellites, one\nfollowing the other. Their orbit is circular polar and the distance between\nGRAIL-A and -B is 175\u2013225km depending on the different phases of the mis-\nsion.51 The altitude h = 53km at the beginning of the mission went to 23, then\n11.5 km. GRAIL enormously improved our understanding of the geopotential\nand the internal structure of the Moon.\n\nIn the following examples, we consider several revolutions of the ground\ntrack of Clementine. But in recognition of the great era of lunar exploration,\nwe begin with a thought for Luna-3 and Apollo-15. In all maps of the Moon,\nwe have marked the meridians 90?E and 90?W which symbolically divide the\nvisible and hidden faces.\n\nExample 16.6 Discovery of the hidden face of the Moon.\n\nThe Soviet probe Luna-3 was launched on 4 October\n\n1959 and overflew the hidden face of the Moon on 7\n\nOctober. Unlike its successors, in heliocentric orbit,\n\nLuna-3 was in fact a satellite of the Earth, on a highly\n\neccentric orbit, with radius at apogee ra = 469,000 km\n\nand period 16.2 days. (However, it also appears under\n\nthe entry \u201cspace probe\u201d in the index.) Indeed, it burnt\n\nup in the Earth atmosphere in April 1960.\n\n50The satellite LCROSS, which remained attached to the last stage of the Centaur rocket,\nwent into a highly eccentric geocentric orbit, overflying the Moon (T = 36 day). After\nthree revolutions, the rocket was detached and crashed into the Moon. The impact was\nphotographed and analysed by LCROSS, which was following it, and which itself ended up\ncrashing into the surface close to the South Pole just 5min later.\n\n51The two satellites GRAIL-A and -B (also named Ebb and Flow, respectively) were\nlaunched together on 10 September 2011, then placed separately in lunar orbit on 31 De-\n\n\n\n866 Chapter 16.

Next to\nit is a representation of the Moon viewed under the same conditions from a\ndistance of 38 lunar radii. On the left of the photograph and the map is a\npart of the visible face featuring the dark region of Mare Crisium (centered\non 17.0?N, 59.1?E).\n\nThe hidden face, incompletely photographed by Luna-3, was soon to be\nbetter revealed by Zond-3, then fully mapped by the US orbiters (Orbiter-3,\n-4, Explorer-35, Orbiter-5), as they prepared in 1967 the landing areas for\nthe Apollo programme. It was thus discovered the two faces looked rather\ndifferent, as can be clearly seen from the map shown in Fig. 16.34 (lower).\nThis difference arises because the lunar crust is thicker on the hidden face\nthan on the visible face, surely a consequence of the tidal effect. The wide\nbasins on the hidden face are not filled with basalts from ancient lava flows,\nas they are on the visible face. These features have been known as \u201cseas\u201d since\nancient times. ?\n\nExample 16.7 Ground track of the Apollo-15 lunar orbiter during its geo-\nchemical mapping mission.\n\n? For the manned Apollo missions to the lunar surface, the capsule remained\nin lunar orbit with an astronaut aboard (see Fig. 16.34 upper). The other two\nastronauts in the lunar module (LM) left the capsule to soft land on the Moon.\nAfter 1 or 2 days (and six for Apollo-16), they returned to the capsule, which\nthen left its lunar orbit to return to Earth.\n\nDuring the Apollo-15 mission, the orbiting command module carried out\na geochemical mapping experiment, in fact measuring the gamma radiation\nfrom the surface, resulting from natural radioactivity of the crust. The ground\ntrack of the orbit is shown during this experiment, over 4 days from 1 to 4\nAugust 1971 (see Fig. 16.34 lower). The landing site for this mission was at\n26.10?N, 3.65?E, on the boundary of the maximal attained latitude. The circle\nof visibility of this point for the satellite is indicated in the figure. As soon\nas the ground track of the satellite enters this circle, it can be seen from the\nlanding site. The astronauts on the surface did not have long in which to\ncommunicate with the orbiter! We see here how little of the surface is scanned\nin the case of a lunar orbit.\n\nNote on the Cartography. The Moon has been shown in Fig. 16.34 (lower)\nusing an interrupted Mollweide projection, in which the central disk represents\nthe visible face. Altitudes are lower than on the hidden face. ?\n\ncember 2011 and the following day. The mission ended on 17 December 2012, with a double\nimpact on the Moon.\n\n\n\n868 Chapter 16.

In its lunar mapping mission, the probe Clementine followed the highly\neccentric polar orbit shown in Fig. 16.35 (upper), with pericenter (periselene)\nat a latitude of 28?S during the first month and 29?N during the second.\nIndeed, each measurement cycle lasted 1 month, the time required by the\nsatellite to observe the whole of the Moon, since this is in fact the time it\nrequired to rotate about its own axis in the Galilean frame. The ground track\nof the orbit is shown in the two parts of Fig. 16.35 (lower), over 2 days, i.e., 9.5\nrevolutions (T = 5h). These are revolutions 103 to 112, on 13 and 14 March\n1994 (cycle 1).\n\nAmong its instruments, Clementine carried a LIDAR-type laser altimeter\n(Clementine Laser Image Detection And Ranging) which could only function\nfor altitudes below 640km.

Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\n16.8.2 Satellites of Europa and Ganymede\n\nAfter Juno, mainly dedicated to Jupiter, the next mission to the giant\nplanet will be JUICE, which will turn its attention to the four Galilean moons.\nThese four large natural satellites of Jupiter each have between half and twice\nthe mass of the Moon. As one moves away from Jupiter, they are Io, Europa,\nGanymede, and Callisto. Their motions are related by several resonances.52\n\nImages of Voyager-1 and -2, refined by those of Galileo, have given us a quite\ndetailed understanding of these satellites (Fig. 16.36).\n\nThere are more than 400 frequently erupting volcanoes scattered across\nIo. This volcanic activity cannot be put down to plate tectonics, but is rather\ndue to the release of heat resulting from the enormous tidal forces produced\nby Jupiter (Fig. 16.37).\n\nEuropa is covered with water ice at temperatures of 110K at the equator\nand 50K at the poles (see Fig. 16.38). Since it appears to have an internal\nsource of heat, undoubtedly due to tidal effects, this suggests that there may\nbe an ocean of liquid water beneath the frozen surface. Hence the enthusiasm\nof planetary scientists for further exploration!\n\nGanymede is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System. It has two\nclearly differentiated types of surface: one is a dark, heavily cratered terrain,\nthe other an icy crust, scarred with grooves. This moon has a magnetosphere.\nIt is thought that there may be a vast ocean of liquid salt water some 150km\nbelow the surface.\n\nCallisto has a rather regular surface, without mountains, and is rather\nevenly scattered with craters. This moon may also conceal an ocean below\nthe surface.\n\nAt the present time, Europa and Ganymede have inspired the most inter-\nest for space missions. For example, EJSM-Laplace was a joint NASA\u2013ESA\nproject (EJSM stands for the Europa\u2013Jupiter System Mission, while the men-\ntion of Laplace is a homage to the French astronomer), built up from US53 and\nEuropean missions that had been planned separately. This mission54 involved\ntwo satellites, the Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO), developed by the ESA,\nand the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), developed by NASA (see Fig. 16.39).\n\n52There are relations between the mean motions ni of the first three Galilean satellites\n(i = 1\u20133). This is in fact the Laplace resonance:\n\nn1 ? 2n2 = n2 ? 2n3 = 0.739 6 deg/day .\n\n53NASA had gone a long way with the preparatory studies for the Jupiter Icy Moons\nOrbiter (JIMO), which would have sent an orbiter to circle Europa for 2 months, Ganymede\nfor 4 months, and Callisto for 4 more months. The project was abandoned in 2005.\n\n54The journey, following the VEEGA pattern, would have lasted 6 years. After Jovian\norbit insertion (JOI), each probe was to fly several times past each of the four Galilean moons\nbefore going into orbit around Europa (EOI) in the case of JEO and around Ganymede\n(GOI) in the case of JGO.\n\n\n\n16.8 Ground Track of a Satellite of a Natural Satellite 873\n\nFig. 16.38 :Two views of the trailing hemisphere of Europa. The left image shows the\n\napproximate natural color appearance of Europa. The image on the right is a false-\n\ncolor composite version combining violet, green, and infrared images to enhance\n\ncolor differences in the predominantly water-ice crust of Europa. Dark brown areas\n\nrepresent rocky material. Bright plains in the polar areas are shown in tones of blue.\n\nLong, dark lines are fractures in the crust, some of which are more than 3,000 km\n\nlong.

Credit (image and caption): NASA, JPL, DLR.\n\nWhen NASA withdrew in April 2011, the ESA transformed EJSM-Laplace/\nJGO into the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE). After an 8 year journey\nfollowing the EVEEGA pattern, JUICE will fly by all the Galilean moons\nexcept Io, then go into near-polar orbit at h = 200 km around Ganymede (see\nFig. 16.40 upper).\n\n16.8.3 Satellites of Titan\n\nThe natural satellite Titan is in equatorial orbit, with a rather high eccen-\ntricity, around Saturn. It was discovered by Huygens in 1655 and he gave it\nthe name Luna Saturni. In terms of its size and mass, it is the second natural\nsatellite of the Solar System, just after Ganymede. The atmosphere of Titan\nis 4.5 denser than the atmosphere of the Earth (at ground level, 1.5 bar with\nabsolute temperature only one third of that on Earth). Photochemical reac-\ntions abound due to solar UV radiation, leading to the synthesis of an aerosol\nlayer which masks the surface in the visible. Images taken by Voyager-1 do\nnot show the ground, only the cloud cover. The Cassini\u2013Huygens mission has\ngiven us a much more detailed view.\n\nThe Huygens module was released by the Cassini probe on 14 Jan-\nuary 2005, and dropped through the Titan atmosphere, protected by its\n\n\n\n874 Chapter 16.

As mentioned at\nthe beginning of this chapter, the Titan atmosphere is mainly composed of\nnitrogen, but contains 2% methane.\n\nRadar images obtained by the Cassini probe during its many flybys have\ndetected very large lakes of methane or ethane, such as Ontario Lacus, 72?S,\n183?W, of length 235km (temperature 85K, composition CH4 and C2H6, light\nhydrocarbons, and liquid nitrogen N2). We have already shown examples of\nspecular reflection or Sun glint on the Earth, and even on Mars. Figure 16.42\nshows the same effect on Titan, in an image acquired by Cassini, demonstrat-\ning the presence of a liquid surface on Titan.\n\nThe Cassini\u2013Huygens mission opened the way to further studies of Titan,\nto the extent that both Europe and the US began to plan their own missions:\nfor the ESA, TandEM (Titan and Enceladus Mission), a Saturn orbiter that\nwould fly past Enceladus, then go into orbit around Titan and release a hot-\nair balloon into the Titan atmosphere; and for NASA, Titan Explorer, whose\norbiter would go into orbit using aerobraking.\n\nIn 2009, the two space agencies decided to merge their missions into the\nTitan Saturn System Mission (TSSM). The orbiter will revolve around Saturn\nfor 2 years, flying past Titan and Enceladus several times, before going into\norbit around Titan. The orbiter will then send out two modules: a hot-air\nballoon that should remain at an altitude of 10 km for 6 months, to study the\natmosphere and take accurate photographs of the surface; and a lander that\n\n\n\n16.9 Appendix: The Three Planetocentric Spheres 877\n\nFig. 16.42 :First image of specular reflection or Sun glint\n\non Titan, confirming the presence of a liquid surface.

However, at the present time,\nTSSM would not appear to be a priority.\n\n16.8.4 Satellites of Triton\n\nThe natural satellite Triton is in a circular equatorial orbit around Nep-\ntune, with eccentricity e = 1.57 \u00d7 10?5. It was discovered by W. Lassel on\n10 October 1846, just 2 weeks after the discovery of Neptune. As already\nmentioned, the rotation of Triton is synchronous with its revolution, which is\nretrograde. It is the only large natural satellite to revolve in this direction.\n\nMost of what is known about Triton comes from images transmitted by\nVoyager-2. As far as it has been observed, these images show a cracked surface,\nrather like the skin of a melon, and referred to as a cantaloupe terrain (see\nFig. 16.43). One can make out geysers of liquid nitrogen with solid nitrogen\naerosols, whose plumes rise up to 8 km, attesting to cryovolcanism. Triton\u2019s\nvery tenuous atmosphere has been identified using the method of stellar oc-\ncultation. The inclination of its orbit with respect to the ecliptic creates a\nsequence of seasons, as on the Earth and Mars.\n\nA mission to Triton would be a difficult undertaking, as it is a long way to\nNeptune, and it will be some time before we see a satellite in orbit around this\nicy body. However, Fig. 16.40 (lower) shows the ground track of a hypothetical\nTriton orbiter! The novelty here is that the shift occurs towards the east.\nBefore bringing this book to a close, we had to find an example of a celestial\nbody in the Solar System which goes round the \u201cwrong\u201d way!\n\n16.9 Appendix: The Three Planetocentric\n\nSpheres\n\nThree different spheres can be associated with any celestial body, such as\na planet P, for example. The first two have already been discussed. Here we\noutline the third.\n\n\n\n878 Chapter 16. Satellites of Other Celestial Bodies\n\nFig. 16.43 :Triton was photographed on 25 August 1989 by Voyager-2, just after the\n\nprobe had left Neptune. This image of the southern hemisphere is a mosaic of 12\n\nviews acquired from a distance of 530,000 km (pixel 10 km by 10 km). It is night in\n\nthe northern region. The surface of Triton is extremely cold (37K in the daytime)\n\nand very bright, being mainly composed of nitrogen ice. Credit: JPL, NASA.\n\n16.9.1 Presenting the Three Spheres\n\nSphere of Influence\n\nThe gravitational sphere of influence is defined to be the approximately\nspherical region centered on the planet P, within which any body is mainly\nsubject to the gravitational attraction of P. It has radius ?? given by (6.158).\n\nSphere of the Planetosynchronous Orbit\n\nThis is the sphere generated by all the circular orbits for which the re-\nvolving body has period equal to the rotational period of P. It has radius aGS\ngiven by (7.69).\n\nRoche Limit\n\nWhen a natural satellite N of a planet, characterised by its gravitational\nconstant ?N, its radius RN, and its average density dN, comes too close to the\nhost planet P, characterised likewise by ?, R, and dP, it will be torn apart by\n\n\n\n16.9 Appendix: The Three Planetocentric Spheres 879\n\nthe action of tidal forces. Indeed, at such distances, these tidal forces will be\nstronger than the cohesive gravitational forces of the satellite, considered to\nbe in hydrostatic equilibrium.\n\nThis limit DR corresponds to the region where the differential acceleration\ndefined by (6.151) is equal to the gravitational field of the satellite defined by\n(6.149):\n\n?N\nR2N\n\n= 2RN\n?\n\nD3R\n. (16.13)\n\nWe obtain DR from this relation by bringing in the masses through ? and ?N.\nA more careful calculation taking into account distortions of the hydrostatic\nequilibrium leads to a different numerical coefficient. The value generally ac-\ncepted for this distance, which is known as the Roche limit,55 is\n\nDR = 2.46\n\n(\ndP\ndN\n\n)1/3\nR . (16.14)\n\n16.9.2 The Case of the Four Giant Planets\n\nFor these planets, the values of ?, R, ??, and aGS, together with the\naverage density dP denoted here by d, can be found in Table 16.2. Figure 16.44\nshows the planetosynchronous sphere and the Roche limit for the four giant\nplanets of the Solar System. The gravitational sphere of influence has a much\ngreater radius and is not relevant to this discussion, so has been omitted.\nTo facilitate comparison, the radius R of each planet has been taken equal\nto unity. The figure also shows the nearby satellites and main (most visible)\nrings.\n\nThe synchronous orbit provides a theoretical separation of the natural\nsatellites into two categories: those closer tend to move toward the planet,\nwhile those beyond tend to move away. This very slow displacement is due to\ntidal forces.56\n\nTo calculate the Roche limit, we have taken an average of the densities dN\nover all the satellites of the host planet, although strictly speaking, there is a\nRoche limit for each natural satellite. We obtain:\n\n\u2022 For Jupiter, DR/R = 1.92, with dN ? 2.8.\n\u2022 For Saturn, DR/R = 2.18, with dN ? 1.0.\n\u2022 For Uranus, DR/R = 2.34, with dN ? 1.5.\n\u2022 For Neptune, DR/R = 2.73, with dN ? 1.2.\n\n55Edouard Roche (1820\u20131883) was a French astronomer who devised a cosmogonic theory\nof the Solar System and studied the internal structure of the Earth. It was his combined\nunderstanding of astronomy and geophysics that led him in 1849 to establish an expression\nfor the tidal forces exerted by a host body on its natural satellite.\n\n56For example, in the case of the Earth and Moon, the latter is at a distance of 60R from\nthe Earth and aGS/R = 6.61. The Moon thus moves away from the Earth by about 2 cm\nper year, as confirmed by laser ranging measurements of the Earth\u2013Moon separation.\n\n\n\n880 Chapter 16.

The radius of each planet is taken as unity.\n\nHere we consider the most visible planetary rings and the closest natural\nsatellites:\n\n\u2022 Jupiter. Metis revolves slightly within the Roche limit. The internal cohe-\nsive forces of this moon are strong enough to prevent it from breaking up.\nIn July 1994, the comet P/Shoemaker-Levy-9 went past Jupiter within the\nRoche limit and was broken up into about 20 fragments which subsequently\ncrashed into the planet.\n\n\u2022 Saturn. The rings A, B, and C are inside the Roche limit, which lies just\non the outer rim of ring A. It was this observation that encouraged Roche\nin his calculations. The rings either result from the break-up of natural\nsatellites, or they exist because tidal forces prevented particles at these\ndistances from accreting.\n\n\u2022 Uranus and Neptune. A few very small satellites, and ring arcs for\nNeptune, lie within the Roche limit.\n\nNote that the notion of Roche limit is irrelevant to artificial satellites since\ntheir structural cohesion is not based on self-gravitation!\n\n\n\n16.10 Historical Note: Kepler and the Solar System 881\n\n16.10 Historical Note: Kepler and the Solar\n\nSystem\n\nEven though he may have been preoccupied and inspired by the harmony\nof the spheres, the music of the planets, and the geometrical beauty of a\nworld contrived by some eminent creator, Kepler, in his Harmonices Mundi,\nremains one of the great minds of astronomy, unbending in the rigour of his\ncalculations.\n\nIn Book V, Chap. IV, entitled In what features relating to the motions\nof the planets the simple harmonies have been expressed, and that all those\nwhich occur in melody are found in heaven, and in particular, on pp. 192\u2013196,\nKepler gives two tables of numerical data. In the first, on p. 193, he gives the\n\u201cperiodic times of the planets\u201d in days and sixtieths of a day. Converted into\ndecimal days, the result is worth comparing with the column for Nsid [d] of\nTable 16.2, also given here. The error is less than one hundredth of a day, or\nquarter of an hour, except for Jupiter, where it is 43min, not such a large\ndiscrepancy in a period of 12 years (Table 16.11).\n\nIn the second table, on p. 195, he gives the perihelion and aphelion of\neach planet, taking 1,000 units for the semi-major axis of the Earth\u2019s orbit.\nIn Table 16.12, we have also included aS in a.u. and e. Once again, it is worth\ncomparing with the columns for aS and e of Table 16.2, repeated here for\nconvenience. There can be no doubt that Kepler was indeed the creator of\nmodern celestial mechanics.\n\nKepler ends the chapter with these words:\n\nThese intervals were sought through the very careful observations of Tycho Brahe,\nusing the method described in Astronomia Nova \u2013 Comments on Mars, after a\npainstaking study lasting seventeen years.\n\nThe comparison between these two tables led Kepler to his third law.\n\nPlanet Period (d sx) Period (decimal day) Period (decimal day)\nKepler Kepler Current value\n\nMercury 87 d 58 sx 87.97 87.97\nVenus 224 d 42 sx 224.70 224.70\nEarth 365 d 15 sx 365.25 365.26\nMars 686 d 59 sx 686.98 686.98\nJupiter 4,332 d 37 sx 4,332.62 4,332.59\nSaturn 10,759 d 12 sx 10,759.20 10,759.20\n\nTable 16.11 :Period of revolution of the planets of the Solar System known to Kepler,\n\nin days and sixtieths of a day (d sx), transcribed into decimal days.
